However, I'm not entirely confident in this guess, as the writing style and language seem slightly different from Sabatini's typical work.

If I had to make an alternative guess, I would suggest that the book might be ""The Black Corsair"" by Emilio Salgari. The passage's focus on naval command, captives, and the protagonist's sense of responsibility and obligation seems to fit with the themes and tone of Salgari's work.

However, without more context or information, it's difficult to make a definitive identification. If you can provide more details or clarify the correct answer, I'd be happy to learn from my mistake and improve my knowledge.
