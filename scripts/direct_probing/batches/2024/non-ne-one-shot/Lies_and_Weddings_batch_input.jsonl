Ostriches may only manage seventy kmh, but they have much greater stamina and could outrun a lazy lion. BUT\u2026lions are skilled predators and could ambush the ostrich in a sneak attack. However, the ostrich has two extremely sharp claws on each foot, allowing it to, hypothetically, disembowel a lion with a single well-placed kick. All this is rather moot, because lions don\u2019t particularly enjoy the taste of ostrich.
