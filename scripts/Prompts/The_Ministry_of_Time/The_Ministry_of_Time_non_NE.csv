There was no genocide-adjacent follow-up: Any family still there [understanding moue]? Do you ever visit [sympathetic smile]? Beautiful country [darkening with tears]; when I visited [visible on lower lid] they were so friendly.…,,[],,52
"“She would never refer to herself as a refugee, or even a former refugee,” I added. “It’s been quite weird to hear people say that.”",,[],,31
"No one had any idea what traveling through time might do to the human body. So the second reason that it was important to pick people who would have died in their own timelines is that they might well die in ours, like deep-sea fish brought up to the beach. Perhaps there were only so many epochs the human nervous system could stand. If they got the temporal equivalent of the bends and sluiced into gray-and-pink jelly in a Ministry laboratory, at least it wouldn’t be, statistically speaking, murder.",,[],,104
"I was thrilled to get the job. I’d plateaued where I was, in the Languages department of the Ministry of Defence. I worked as a translator-consultant specializing in Southeast Asia, specifically Cambodia. I’d learned the languages I translated from at university. Despite my mother speaking Khmer to us at home, I hadn’t retained it through my formative years. I came to my heritage as a foreigner.",,[],,83
"I liked my Languages job well enough, but I’d wanted to become a field agent, and after failing the field exams twice I was at a bit of a loss for career trajectory. It wasn’t what my parents had had in mind for me. When I was a very small child, my mother made her ambitions known. She wanted me to be prime minister. As prime minister, I would “do something” about British foreign policy and I would also take my parents to fancy governmental dinners. I would have a chauffeur. (My mother never learned to drive; the chauffeur was important.) Regrettably she also drilled the karmic repercussions of gossip and lying into me—the fourth Buddhist precept is unambiguous on this—and thus at the age of eight my political career was over before it began.",,[],,161
"He had a mole on his throat, close to his earlobe. The only existing daguerreotype of him showed him in 1840s fashion, with a high cravat. I stared at the mole.",,[],,45
"He folded his arms and regarded me. His eyes were hazel, scrawled faintly with green, and thickly lashed. They were both striking and uncommunicative.",,[],,38
"This is everything I remember about my earliest hours with him. We separated and spent the fading day bobbing shyly around each other like clots in a lava lamp. I was expecting him to have a time-travel-induced psychotic break and perhaps chew or fold me with murderous intent. Mostly he touched things, with a compulsive brushing motion I was later to learn was because of permanent nerve damage from frostbite. He flushed the toilet fifteen times in a row, silent as a kestrel while the cistern refilled, which could have been wonder or embarrassment. At hour two, we tried to sit in the same room. I looked up when he breathed in sharply through his nose to see him pulling his fingers away from a light bulb in the lamp. He retreated to his bedroom for a while, and I went to sit on the back porch. It was a mild spring evening. Idiot-eyed wood pigeons lumbered across the lawn, belly-deep in clover.",,[],,199
"Upstairs, I heard a cautious woodwind polonaise strike up, waver, and cease. A few moments later, his tread in the kitchen. The pigeons took off, their wings making a noise like swallowed laughter.",,[],,46
"He hands off his bag to the officers’ steward and insists on attending the meeting, trying to shake the ice-dementia. He knows without consulting a glass that his mouth is corpsey blue.",,[],,40
"They fall silent again. This had once been a convivial wardroom. A story couldn’t start that wasn’t met with an opposing tale, like an arch bridge made of chatter. But even speaking the obvious is like massaging wax from granite these days. The persistent grieving and shrieking of the wood of the ice-locked ship robs them of sleep and silence between paragraphs; without those fallow periods, all speech is feeble.",,[],,89
"I said, “Did you get my email about the budget? And getting a cleaner? Not a Ministry ‘cleaner.’ Someone who does the hoovering.”",,[],,33
"The bridges were all wound up. No one else’s expat had had a polite nervous breakdown and dissected a toilet, but the other bridges described an expat trying to address God through Radio 3, another picking a fight with a parked car.",,[],,51
"This made me laugh, even though I knew the expatriation eyeball story. I didn’t ask him if the captain had explained the First World War, or maybe he’d been told and then failed to retain the information. I didn’t know to what extent his brain, behind that broad white forehead, had been shaken and bruised like an overripe peach.",,[],,74
"“So he’ll have to write about my pornographic raincoat instead,” I finished lamely. “Er. How are you finding the, er—the whole—Is he all right, your expat?”",,[],,41
"He came to the table with two iced glasses and the entire bottle, which he set down in front of me. I slid the cigarettes across to him, and he lit one briskly.",,[],,38
"He raised his eyebrows at the ice in his glass, tipped it back and forth. I pulled a second cigarette, and he lit it for me with automatic politeness.",,[],,34
"He didn’t like twenty-first-century language. “Victorian” was his greatest descriptive enemy, and to be fair, I’d heard people apply the word miscellaneously to any period 1710–1916. But much of what I thought of as quintessentially “Victorian” was in his future and, to him, gargantuan, disproportionate, ungentlemanly, unpious. He didn’t understand my use of the term “classical music,” which meant something to do with formal classicism to him and meant, to me, that it had violins. He hated “text” as a verb, “sex” as an act, “tomato” as a salad product. One afternoon he came in from a walk and asked me, very thoughtfully, “Some charming young women—out on the heath—addressed me quite boisterously—what is a ‘DILF’?”",,[],,188
"Eventually he asked if he would meet my family, eyes full of hopeful curiosity. This was forbidden, but I reluctantly showed him a picture of my parents and sister on my personal phone, the screen supernovaed with cracks. He pointed at my sister, beaming. “Oh! There’s two of you!” he said in a voice so full of naked delight that I hurriedly put the phone away.",,[],,82
"He’d had a dog on the expedition, I knew, a black Labrador so ancient that a number of letters from the other expedition members remarked on the animal’s decrepitude. It must have died, along with all the men he’d served with. I said, with the intent to get off dangerous ground, “Cats are smaller.”",,[],,68
"I almost pushed a green bean into my lungs. He watched me, let me bar my shaking throat with my fingers, gargling vegetable, before he poured me water.",,[],,34
"“It’s called—well, cannabis. But it’s got a lot of names. It was legalized a few years ago, and now it’s very uncool.”",,[],,33
"“Fashion,” I muttered. I pulled out my phone, googled a picture of a girl in a sixties miniskirt, and held it up to him. He blushed with his face on mute.",,[],,44
"Growing up in a house like that made me obsessive about archiving. It made me an excellent civil servant and my sister a meticulous copy editor. I adored the world in a reducible format. There wasn’t a man so special that he might not one day find himself in a footnote or one of my green hanging files. With my hand over the archives, I had control over the system. It didn’t matter that it was only the filing system. It was control, and that was what I wanted.",,[],,103
"He was, however, enamored of the concept of endless music, disseminated into any room. It was how he started to learn to type, carefully pecking in the names of symphonies and taking a full minute to find the letter “M.” He said that, in his own time, he had hunted and drilled and drawn up watches to a fragmented gurgle of internal music, like Joan of Arc with a Walkman; now, at last, he could play the music he had always half remembered.",,[],,106
"In the end, we converted one of the wood-paneled rooms in the Ministry into a “library” where the tests would be conducted. The Secretary for Expatriation personally paid for the addition of dozens of leather-bound volumes of Enlightenment-era science and travel to the shelves. One of the administrators, who had a master’s degree in art history, bought some framed Canaletto prints on the tech supply budget, which caused a brief fracas, but the Secretary liked those too, so it got signed off.",,[],,105
The operator sucked his teeth and made some rapid notes about whatever my readings had just done. I don’t think he expected the question any more than I did. I visualized sinking backward into black mud.,,[],,41
I reached inside the hen and pulled out the coin purse that came with it. It was in the shape of a small yellow chick. He smiled.,,[],,30
"“From him have I learned much language, but the lessons are mithered and troublesome to hold. What is a ‘feminist killjoy’?”",,[],,32
"She pulled a modern face—crowded with punch line, the sort you see on stand-up comedy specials. I had the sense she’d learned the face and figured the Ministry and its employees as an audience, which suggested an instinct for camouflage that I hadn’t expected. I tried to look at her more closely, but her glamour got in the way.",,[],,71
"“That’s bad,” I hazarded. (Later I would look these up in the Ministry online cross-era dictionary and discover “sex worker” and “mentally disabled person.”) “He’s very striking, isn’t he?”",,[],,46
"He looked back into my face. He looked much too intensely, and I felt his gaze sting my pores. “I suppose they were,” he said. “But I think of them as war writers. It’s my specialism. The war.”",,[],,50
"“Don’t worry about the pedals for now. Just focus on getting your balance. We’re at the top of a hill, see? So if you just let the momentum take you…”",,[],,38
"“Yes, very good,” I shouted after him. “Now you need to pull on the brakes. Pull on the brakes! Pull on the—”",,[],,30
"A few days later, when the heat had dropped to a mild eighty-four degrees, we cycled to Westminster. I’d suggested an easier, shorter route to a quieter destination, and he’d said, “Why?” so we went to Westminster. He was nearly run over twice, and it put him in a good mood. He was really going native if he knew how to best the London traffic.",,[],,81
"I trotted down the corridor to the nearest kitchen. Kitchens in restricted areas are farcical, by the way. All paperwork that enters restricted areas has to be accounted for, which means that if people put Post-its on their lunches, e.g, SANDRA’S. DON’T TOUCH, PLEASE, they had to be stamped with UNCLASSIFIED. The project’s operators and administrators couldn’t even start a Ping-Pong league without getting Secretary approval—which they did, and which the bridges were explicitly not invited to join.",,[],,107
"Not long afterward, I received three emails in a row: first, from the Wellness team, indicating that there were irregularities with the results of some of the medical scans done on the expats; then a second from the Secretary for Expatriation, denying the existence of irregularities and demanding forgetfulness of the first email; then a third heavy-handed message reminding its recipient list of the consequences of breaking the contract of the Official Secrets Act as it pertained to our work.",,[],,97
"The gun lets go its bullet with a sonorous bark. There’s a cry across the ice. A broken noise. Terribly, terribly human.",,[],,30
"While I was biting the skin off my thumb and rereading the “Undeliverable” notice, I got a phone call on my work phone from an unknown number. All phones assigned to the project had private, protected numbers and there was no way it could have been a spam call, or even a casual one. I picked up. On the other end was the Vice Secretary for Expatriation.",,[],,83
"“Oh, it’s not the century, it’s the soul,” said the Brigadier. “Her ‘hereness’ and ‘thereness’ have no consistency, no continency, and she is beginning to slip out of time. It is unusually accelerated in Seventeen-ninety-three. She does not even try to bring her ‘thereness’ in line, you see. Because she is grieving, and grief will always take one out of time.”",,[],,92
“Kind of you to say so. I’m afraid I’m going to have to get you both very drunk. I’m not a much of a cook.”,,[],,32
"I dropped the wooden spoon back into the pan and said, “Would you like a martini? It’s the only drink I know how to mix. This is a classy household.”",,[],,37
"Overcorrecting out of cautiousness will be as damaging to his adjustment as forcing him home. His “readability” has not, hitherto, been a cause of concern.",,[],,37
"“Yes,” she said finally. “Do you remember when you told the Secretary that you were finding the whole proposed ‘readability’ monitoring a bit MK-Ultra? It got me thinking about what we’re doing with the expats. I’m a clinical professional. I’m supposed to be governed by a code of ethics.”",,[],,65
"I let her leave without saying goodbye and sat in the pool of silence that followed the crash of the front door slamming shut. This was one of my first lessons in how you make the future: moment by moment, you seal the doors of possibility behind you.",,[],,53
"I reached out and took his hand, in a way that I hope he found comforting, but also in such a way that I could subtly slide two fingers down his sleeve. His pulse sped against my fingertips.",,[],,42
"“I know you don’t believe me,” he said quickly. “I wouldn’t either. But I can prove it. This project isn’t about scientific advancement. It’s about a weapon.”",,[],,38
"Time happened to me very quickly, and then very slowly. Panic as much as grief warps the way internal time works; I just had the wherewithal to wonder if this would be worth raising with the Wellness team.",,[],,45
"You can’t trauma-proof life, and you can’t hurt-proof your relationships. You have to accept you will cause harm to yourself and others. But you can also fuck up, really badly, and not learn anything from it except that you fucked up. It’s the same with oppression. You don’t gain any special knowledge from being marginalized. But you do gain something from stepping outside your hurt and examining the scaffolding of your oppression. You’ll find the weak joints, the things you can kick in. When I look back at myself on the bridge year, I see that I thought I was doing something constructive, escaping exploitation by becoming exceptional. In fact, what I was doing was squeezing my eyes shut and singing la la la at the gathering darkness, as if the gathering darkness cared that I couldn’t see it.",,[],,165
"“I thought it might be useful,” he said. That was all the explanation I got, because at this point a pipe must have exploded and the street turned into a waterslide.",,[],,36
"On Christmas Eve, my family eat yao hon—Cambodian hot pot. The hot pot we keep warm at the table by means of an ancient camping stove; the discs of rice paper for yao hon we soften in bowls filled with hot water, which more than one guest has mistaken for a finger bowl. From the dining room, I could hear my parents bickering over the camping stove’s remains.",,[],,81
"There were more piles of things around the house. The paperwork had started breeding in captivity. Plastic takeaway boxes stood on supra-cluttered surfaces, crammed with hand sanitizers, Band-Aids, elastic bands, bottle openers, and Post-its covered in parental hieroglyphics. My sister jogged upstairs and underarm-bowled my bag into my bedroom. I heard the crash of a column of papers.",,[],,86
My sister spiraled into aggressive defensiveness. Something something write what I want something something radical ugly truth something something vengeance in record something something our voices our narrative.,,[],,32
"Being unused to and out of practice with this machine, I must make this brief. We are having a splendid, if somewhat pagan, time. I have strong-armed the company into attending the midnight service this evening. 65 cannot and will not behave. 16 and I have taken over the cooking of the trimmings but we dare not attempt the bird. I will telephone you on Christmas Day, to ensure you are in one piece. This missive took me half an hour to write.",,[],,101
"“That’s not true, I am sure. I wish you would tell me more about your mother’s people. Do they have special traditions at Christmas?”",,[],,30
“We’re close to a forest. About a mile from a lovely lake I used to paddle in during the summer. I’ve been hissed at by several generations of geese.”,,[],,36
"There were a few seconds of silence on the other end, and I thought he’d lost the connection, until he said, “I’m smiling too.”",,[],,31
"My heartbeat skittered. He coughed unnaturally and seemed to reconsider his train of thought. “Tell me what it was like, growing up there.”",,[],,34
"Time dilated. There were sirens and blue lights seemingly instantaneously, but I couldn’t be persuaded to let go of a traffic post for hours and hours (it transpired to be slightly less than a minute). I’d worn my black stilettos for the ceremony, and one of the heels had snapped. I was standing lopsided in a farce of my very own.",,[],,79
"“Sir—” said the uniform heatedly. We ignored her. I kicked my shoe off and put my stockinged foot on his thigh. He broke the heel and then guided my foot back into the aftermath. On the top of his head was a patch, smaller than the base of a wineglass, where his riotous black curls had started to thin. When he looked up at me, I was struck by the starkness of his crow’s-feet. It unnerved me to see how human a body he inhabited.",,[],,107
"As January stumbled on, I fell into lethargy, and he fell into caretaking. It was my job to take care of, and look after, him. He was not forced through time and space to play nurse for a depressed civil servant. Yet here we were, and I couldn’t find the energy to remedy the situation. I was beginning to hate everything: the house, my job, the oily stink of my unwashed hair.",,[],,90
"One afternoon, I made a cursory tour of the landing and the bathroom, then went back to bed. I lay there long enough that my parted mouth made a wet oval on the pillow. He knocked at my bedroom door. I rolled over so that I was face up.",,[],,56
"I was deep in the gray room on the bottom floor of my skull. I wasn’t watching her face or hearing her voice when she asked. I didn’t really notice that she wasn’t talking to me the way psychiatrists talk; she was talking to me like someone desperate to talk herself. But I didn’t catch what she was trying to draw out of me. I said, “No,” and we sat in silence and watched my tea get cold until she remembered there was something she had to do somewhere else and left.",,[],,106
"I didn’t have an answer for this, so I had some wine. It tasted vile, like chewing geraniums. Wetly, my brain connected action and consequence: he had brought up “tonic” wine, since he regarded me as unwell, and was gamely drinking it with me so I would not realize how unwell I was. I’m sure if he could have sourced laudanum, he would have done.",,[],,89
"He was sitting up at the dining table, curled like a pot-bound root over the laptop. There was a cigarette between his lips, and six more stubbed out in the ashtray. He looked up when I came in. His expression had a scraped-clean bareness to it.",,[],,57
"Tap water overflowed the glass and ran down my fist. “Well,” I said slowly, “the Ministry thought it might be detrimental to your adjustment—”",,[],,32
"You think I was clumsy. You think I could have handled it better. No doubt you’re right. It was a teaching moment that I fumbled; worse, it was a moment I’d created, and my actions had consequences. But what could I have said? That the Holocaust was one of the most appalling, most shameful stains on the history of humanity, and it could have been prevented? Everything that has ever been could have been prevented, and none of it was. The only thing you can mend is the future. Believe me when I say that time-travel taught me that.",,[],,122
"The Ministry’s internal CCTV system was exempt from the laws of the Information Commissioner’s Office. I couldn’t access footage without filing for permission on behalf of the bridge team, which would mean everyone from the Secretary downward would see me ratting around in the digital drywall. But I had security clearance to ask for a record of permissions requested, granted, and denied; technical faults reported; tapes scrubbed after the requisite thirty days and tapes filed for archive use; and so on. I whistled for the paperwork.",,[],,103
"I filed an access request for a history of access requests. I found a record of external accesses to the reroute system, scrambled to protect the identity of the accessor. Username, clearance level, authority, and permissions were all scrambled. But there was a digital record of the fingerprint scan.",,[],,58
"I didn’t know what to do with myself, so I lifted my face to drop it into my hands—a childish urge to vanish my problems by shutting off my eyes.",,[],,34
"He pulled hard on the cigarette, so that its tip glowed like a warning signal, then plucked nervily at his packet for another. He used the burning cigarette to light the next one and glumly swapped them. At length he said, “It should not have happened. And I’m terribly sorry for the way that it did.”",,[],,70
"“Well, I thought, maybe—I don’t know. In my time, you know, things progressed very differently. I didn’t know what you wanted.”",,[],,31
"He shrugged and settled back on the pillows, ashing into the mug on the bedside table. I rummaged around the scant supplies of my diplomacy.",,[],,30
"To my surprise, he went quiet again, and regarded the end of his cigarette. Eventually he said, “Well. One is a long time at sea.”",,[],,32
"Axioms have us sealing all sorts of things with kisses. Vows. Envelopes. Fates. But parents don’t always tell their children what the slurs and curses mean, for their protection. I thought it would be better, for now, that I didn’t mention the microchip. To tell you the truth I tried not to think about it at all.",,[],,77
"“Well, she laughed at me for a while. But. My understanding of ‘dating,’ ” he said, “is that it is like trying on clothes for fit, except that the clothes are people.”",,[],,42
"He ran his hands through his hair. The curls flattened and sprang back. I was overwhelmed with the desire to touch him. So it was a shock, the psychic equivalent of biting down on bone, when he said, very quietly, “I want to touch you.”",,[],,54
"There were some things about sleeping with a Victorian naval officer that didn’t surprise me, and there were others that astonished me. He kept trying to touch the edge of license, but my parameters were so much more capacious than his. I didn’t have the same sense of shame of it, but I don’t think I ever had the same sense of holiness either.",,[],,75
"I became demented about his body in nonsexual contexts. If his shirt lifted and his trousers dragged when he was trying to reach a high shelf, revealing a crescent moon of hip bone, my heart would beat so hard I could basically chew it. The mole on his throat had me writing poetry. Watching him fumble for his cigarettes in his pockets was an incredible experience. By contrast, he liked watching me shower, and I just let him. He’d smoke while he watched, and I’d come out of the bathroom with my wet hair stinking.",,[],,113
"When we reached the field, it was a line of darkness scrawled on the deeper darkness. We stumped our bikes over the wet, breathless earth.",,[],,33
"The companies of Erebus and Terror struggle through the winter of 1847. Their best sportsman is dead—not that there’s much hunting to be had. A single storm on the ice wipes out another hunting party of two officers and three men, whose bodies are never found. Others succumb to the claws of the climate, to scurvy, to madness. Men starve and rave, dreaming of gravy. There isn’t enough coal to heat the ships, nor enough candles to light the Arctic winter. Franklin’s bold adventurers lie for hours in the dark, too cold and hungry to move, while the darkness looks like ink-soaked cardboard pressed against the portholes. The ships smell like carrion.",,[],,144
"“And baby makes three,” said the maintenance woman. She snorted when we ignored her and cantered off. The Ministry suffered a maintenance emergency more or less every half hour during the lockdown; she’d be needed elsewhere.",,[],,44
"Under the March sunlight, the buildings of the Old Royal Naval College looked scrubbed and canvas-clean. He stared out over the long green lawns, frowning.",,[],,32
"“Little cat,” he said, and I obediently trotted to his side. There were at least two other people in sight distance, which meant we were in public, which meant he wasn’t going to kiss me or embrace me, but he reached out and quickly squeezed my hand. For him, this was a scandalous display of affection.",,[],,70
"He held up his wooden fork, and I broke off. His lips were pale. So was the rest of his face, but it was the lips that startled me. Finally he said, “Do you believe the natives were telling the truth?”",,[],,49
"“So far as I understand it, I am your work. Thus, you are working. Do you like it—when I am very deep—like this—?”",,[],,33
"I had a feeling like I’d always assumed I was a real girl but someone had flicked me in the eye and it had produced no pain, only a glassy click: I was just a doll, with no more inner intelligence than a bottle of water.",,[],,53
"He stamped his foot through the discarded drawer. The board at the bottom splintered, and I saw a flash of dark blue. Passports. I was prepared to bet my emergency rations that they were under fake names.",,[],,46
"“My bridge has been absent for too long. I hied to his dwelling, as I thought that Moorish woman wouldst know best where my keeper hid. I discovered his body. Lower thy weapon.”",,[],,41
"He stripped to the waist, facing away from me, and knelt. I wedged a flashlight into a crack in the wall and reached out. As soon as I touched him, he shuddered. I wondered if he was thinking, as I was thinking, of all the times my hand had lain here, on his naked back.",,[],,69
"“Don’t parrot. Yes. I’m amazed you hadn’t worked that out already. I’m from, let’s see, twenty-odd years in your future. These two are from the twenty-two hundreds.”",,[],,44
"“There are declassified records,” the Brigadier translated, “that show the Ministry had the noncombatant expats killed once they realized the door only supported a limited number of people.”",,[],,37
"She lifted her thumb to her mouth and bit the edge of the skin. “Technically,” she said, “we both did. Since you are me.”",,[],,32
"The people he persistently thinks of as his captors take him along a corridor. He’s learned, through delirious trial and error, that the lumps beneath their brief jackets are guns. It has been a difficult few weeks.",,[],,46
"“You were in the Discovery Service, weren’t you?” one of the white-robed attendants had said. “Think of this as a mission of discovery.”",,[],,31
"My wrist jerked up about an inch. The urge to chew my thumb skin was as bad as the craving for a cigarette. I sat, as subtly as I could, on my hand.",,[],,39
"He waited. I edged out into the conversation again. “Yes. She did… have a gun. What do you mean, attempted to destroy the door?”",,[],,32
"“It’s an extraordinary machine. It can pierce the very fabric of space-time. I don’t think it can be destroyed by something as prosaic as a handheld gun. It is… damaged. I am not at liberty to say more. I would advise you not to pursue this line of questioning, in case I find I am interested in a new line of my own.”",,[],,77
"My work laptop and work phone were confiscated. As I never used my personal phone—an ancient model with half a screen—to take photos, this also meant that I had no pictures of him. All I had left were the internet’s reproductions of the 1845 daguerreotype, just as I did before he came into my life. I wore chicken necklace, warming it between the pads of my fingers, and tried to recall his hands. But the image faded. One morning I woke up and I found I could no longer remember exactly what color his eyes were.",,[],,117
"At the left-hand edge of the photograph, there was a glint of something. I tilted it, squinted and bent my neck. There were strands blowing in the wind—copper-flushed gold, gossamer-light. Hair. There was also the barest vertical sliver of fuchsia. I was looking at long strawberry-blond hair and the edge of an arm in a hot-pink jacket, far enough away from the lens that someone else must have taken the picture. This was a photograph that showed two people, then: one just out of view, and one behind the camera. They were alive.",,[],,126
