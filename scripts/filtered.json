            "en": "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By-and-by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn\u2019t no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that\u2019s on its mind and can\u2019t make itself understood, and so can\u2019t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn\u2019t need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn\u2019t no confidence. You do that when you\u2019ve lost a horseshoe that you\u2019ve found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn\u2019t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you\u2019d killed a spider.",

Despu\u00e9s me sent\u00e9 en una silla junto a la ventana y trat\u00e9 de pensar en algo animado, pero era in\u00fatil. Me sent\u00eda tan solo que casi me daban ganas de morirme.

I also returned to my room, carrying a candle to place on the table. I plopped down on the chair by the window, trying to think of something fun, but I couldn't think of anything. At that moment, I felt so lonely and wished that I could just die. In the sky, the stars were twinkling. The sound of rustling leaves in the forest was incredibly mournful. I heard the distant hoot of an owl as if it were calling out to someone who had passed away, then the cry of a forest bird or a dog howling about someone who was about to die, and the wind seemed to whisper something to me that I couldn't figure out what it was trying to say. Thinking that, I shivered and felt a chill run through my body. Then after a while, from the distant forest came a sound like a ghost trying to express its worries but couldn't make anyone understand; it seemed like it couldn't rest peacefully in its grave and had to wander mournfully every night like that. Thinking that made me even more terrified, and at that moment, I wished there was someone sitting next to me. Suddenly, a spider jumped onto my shoulder from somewhere, crawling on my shirt, I quickly flicked it off with my hand, and it shot straight into the burning candle, and before I could pull it out, it was dead. At that moment, I didn't need anyone to tell me that it was a bad omen and that I would face misfortune, I was already very scared and frantically shook my clothes. I jumped up, spun around three or four times, and then made the sign of the cross many times. Then I took a string and tied up my hair to make a charm to ward off evil spirits. But then I didn't believe it either. This was the custom when someone lost something, after finding it, they were supposed to tie a bow at the front door; but I had never heard anyone say that doing so would prevent bad luck after killing a spider.",

The stars were shining brightly and the leaves in the forest were rustling mournfully, I heard an owl hooting in the distance; it was saying puuu-huuu for someone who had died; also, a whip-poor-will and a dog were howling to announce that someone nearby was going to die; the wind was trying to whisper something to me, but I couldn't understand what it was, so a cold shiver ran down my spine. Then, from the depths of the forest, I heard a sound like that made by ghosts who, unable to convey their troubles, leave their graves in despair and wander around every evening in torment. I was so demoralized and so scared that I wished someone were with me. Soon after, a spider started climbing up my shoulder, and when I flicked it, it fell onto the candle; before I could even move, it was scorched. No one needed to tell me that this was a terribly bad omen and would bring me bad luck, I started trembling like a leaf out of fear. I stood up and turned around three times, making the sign of the cross each time; then I tied a piece of string to a lock of my hair to keep the witches away. But I still didn't feel at ease.

Then, out in the forest, I heard that noise ghosts make when they want to say something they're thinking and can't make themselves understood, so they can't rest in the grave and have to stay up all night.

Then a spider climbed up my shoulder and I brushed it off and it fell into the candle, and before I could reach out, it was already all burned up. No one needed to tell me that this was very bad luck and that it was going to bring me misfortune, so I got scared and almost tore my clothes off. I got up and walked three circles making the sign of the cross each time, and then I tied a lock of my hair with a thread so that witches wouldn't come near me. But I wasn't sure at all.

Anyway, one night, late at night, as I was passing by a door left ajar, I heard our old master telling the widow that he was going to sell me to those folks in Orleans; he didn\u2019t actually want to sell me, but he could get eight hundred dollars for me, which was too much money to resist. The widow tried to talk him out of it, but I didn\u2019t stay to hear more. I ran away immediately, just like that.",

Well, one night I go up to the door very late, and the door wasn't completely closed, and I hear the old maid telling the widow that she's going to sell me in Orleans, even though she didn't want to, but that she could get eight hundred dollars for me, and it was so much money that she couldn't resist.

After that, I quietly went outside and threw the snake carcasses far away into the bushes; because I was determined to do everything I could so that Jim wouldn't learn it was all my fault.",

And all that because I had been so stupid that I didn't remember that whenever you kill a snake, its mate always appears and coils around it. Jim told me to cut off the snake's head and throw it away, then skin the body and roast a piece. That's what I did, and he ate it and said it would help cure him. He made me remove the rattles and tie them to his wrist. He said that would also relieve him. Then I went out quietly and threw the snakes far away into the bushes, because I wasn't going to let Jim find out that it was all my fault if I could help it."

That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit. I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by-and-by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn\u2019t walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket.

He thought for a moment and then suggested that I should take off the old clothes I was wearing and disguise myself as a girl. That idea sounded good. So we took a short-cut dress, rolled up my pants to the knees, and then put the dress on. Jim used a fishhook to gather the back of the dress, making it look quite nice. I put on a wide-brimmed hat and tied the hat's string under my chin. If anyone wanted to look closely and see my face, they would have to bend down as if looking into a stove chimney. Jim said that no one would recognize me, even in broad daylight; it would be very hard to recognize me. All day long, I practiced walking to get used to it, and gradually I felt quite comfortable in that outfit; but Jim told me that my walk still didn't look like a girl's walk and that I should stop lifting the dress to put my hands in my pants pockets.

Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\u2019t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a \u201ccrossing\u201d; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn\u2019t always run the channel, but hunted easy water.",

Jim prepar\u00f3 un suelo para el wigwam y lo levant\u00f3 un pie m\u00e1s por encima del nivel de la balsa, de forma que las mantas y las trampas estaban fuera del alcance del oleaje de los barcos de vapor. Justo en medio del wigwam pusimos una capa de polvo de cinco o seis pulgadas de grueso y la rodeamos con un bastidor para que no se saliera; era para hacer fuego cuando lloviese o hiciera fr\u00edo; con el wigwam no se podr\u00eda ver. Tambi\u00e9n preparamos un tim\u00f3n de repuesto, porque uno de los que ten\u00edamos pod\u00eda romperse o engancharse o lo que fuera. Preparamos un palo con una horquilla del que colgar el viejo farol, porque siempre tendr\u00edamos que encenderlo cuando vi\u00e9ramos un barco de vapor que ven\u00eda r\u00edo abajo, para que no nos pasara inadvertido, pero no ten\u00edamos que encenderlo para los que iban r\u00edo arriba salvo que nos vi\u00e9ramos en lo que ellos llaman \u00abentre corrientes\u00bb, porque el r\u00edo segu\u00eda muy alto y las riberas bajas continuaban sumergidas, de forma que los barcos que lo remontaban no sub\u00edan siempre por el canal, sino que iban buscando aguas m\u00e1s f\u00e1ciles.",
            "vi_translation": "It started to get dark, so we poked our heads out from the pile of cotton, looked around, and saw nothing. Then Jim lifted the planks on the raft and set them up into a tent so we could crawl into it when it rained or shone, and to keep our belongings from getting wet. Jim also built an additional wooden platform about thirty centimeters high on the outside so that when large waves from passing ships hit, they wouldn't splash onto our belongings. In the middle of the tent, we made a small depression, filled it with soil about a decimeter deep, and surrounded it with wood to make a fireplace for when it rained and got cold, and also to keep it inside the tent so people wouldn't see it. We erected a short stick with a notch at the top to hang an old lantern on whenever a ship was passing downstream, to avoid collisions. As for the boats going upstream, we didn't need to light the lantern unless we were crossing the river; because the surface water flowed quite strongly, and there were many hidden sandbars below, so upstream boats often didn't travel in the middle of the river but chose spots where the current was less strong.",
            "tr_translation": "When it started to get dark, we poked our heads out from between the dense poplars and looked up, down, and across; there was nothing; so Jim took apart a few of the upper planks of the raft to make a narrow shelter to get under in the extreme heat and rain, and also to keep our belongings dry. He made space on the raft for the shelter, then raised it about half a meter above the raft's floor; this way, our blankets and traps would no longer be affected by the waves created by the steamers. We made a 15-centimeter deep hole in the middle of the shelter out of mud, and supported its perimeter with planks to prevent it from spreading; this was for making a fire in rainy or cool weather, and the shelter would block the fire from being seen from a distance. We also made an extra steering pole, because the others could get stuck somewhere and break. We set up a short forked stick to hang the old tattered lantern, because when you see a steamer coming down the river, you must light the lantern so it doesn't hit you; but if we weren't at one of those places they call \"crossings,\" there was no need to light the lantern for steamers going upriver. The river was still quite high, and the low-lying banks were still underwater; so the ships going upriver could prefer places with less current instead of using the usual channel.",
            "es_translation": "When it started to get dark, we poked our heads out among the poplars and looked up and down and to the sides but saw nothing, so Jim took some of the logs off the top of the raft and built a very comfortable wigwam for us to take shelter in when it got very hot or rained and to keep things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot above the level of the raft, so that the blankets and traps were out of reach of the steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam, we put a layer of dirt five or six inches thick and surrounded it with a frame to keep it from spilling out; it was for making a fire when it rained or got cold; with the wigwam, it wouldn't be visible. We also prepared a spare rudder, because one of the ones we had could break or get caught or whatever. We set up a pole with a fork to hang the old lantern from, because we would always have to light it when we saw a steamboat coming downstream, so it wouldn't miss us, but we didn't have to light it for the ones going upstream unless we found ourselves in what they call \"between currents,\" because the river was still very high and the low banks were still submerged, so the boats going upstream didn't always go through the channel but looked for easier waters."

We had to find a way to get something out of there and escape. We walked while shaking the ship's sides, but why did it feel so slow, as if it would take a week just to reach the stern. There was no sign of any boat. Jim said he wasn't sure if he could walk anymore, he was so scared that he had no strength left to walk - that's what he said. But I urged him to keep going, if we got stuck on this wrecked ship, we would surely die. We continued to grope our way forward. We managed to reach the stern, clinging to the window frame, but the window was almost submerged. When we got to the main door to go to the passenger cabin, we saw a small boat there. It's definitely a boat, I can see it clearly. Oh my God! There is no greater joy than this. I was just about to climb up when the door suddenly opened.

So we started walking again. We passed behind the captain's cabin, then reached for the skylight, holding onto the covers as part of the window was underwater. As we got closer to the corridor door, we finally located the boat! I could barely see its silhouette. I didn't know how to thank God.

We went to the stern of the upper deck and found it; then we climbed up through the skylight as best we could, grabbing onto every iron, because the edge of the skylight was already in the water.

Later, during difficult times, there would be no one to help or support me, and I might even be beaten. I thought for a minute, then told myself: if earlier I hadn't done the wrong thing by bringing Jim out, would I feel more at ease now?

No, I said, I would feel bad \u2013 just as I feel bad now. So what's the use of learning to do the right thing? Doing the right thing gets you into trouble; when you do the wrong thing, no one gets hurt, and in both cases, you feel bad. When I got to this point, I was stuck. I had no answer to give.

Well, then,\" I said to myself, \"what's the use of learning to do things right when you have problems if you do them right and no problems if you do them wrong and the result is always the same?\" I was trapped.

Then we sat back down to watch the deserted river. People started to get tired, and we lay down to sleep. From time to time, we woke up and looked outside to see if there was anything. Perhaps it was a boat laboriously climbing upstream on the far side of the river; from a distance, it was impossible to tell if it was a stern-wheeler or had paddle wheels on both sides. Then another hour passed, with nothing to see or hear, just silence. Later, a raft drifted by on the outer edge. Perhaps there was a guy on the raft chopping wood, because they often chop wood right on the raft. From inside here, they could see the glint of the axe being raised, and just as the axe was lifted above his head, there was a thud, a sound that took a moment to travel over the water before reaching our ears. Then we lay back down, listening to the quiet return. Once, in thick fog, boats and rafts had to clang pots and pans to avoid being hit by steamships. A ferry or raft or something passed by us, so close that we could clearly hear them talking, swearing, and laughing loudly, even though we couldn't see anything, as if we were blindfolded; it really felt like ghostly voices drifting through the air. Jim said maybe they really were ghosts. I said:",

Then for about an hour, nothing else would be heard or seen \u2013 just solitude. Then you would see a raft passing in the distance, perhaps with an inexperienced raftsman cutting wood on it, because such types always cut wood on the raft; you would see the axe glint as it rises and falls \u2013 but you wouldn't hear anything; then the axe rises again; as it reaches above the man's head, you hear the thud! sound, it takes that long for the sound to reach you over the water. That's how we spent the day, lazing around, listening intently to the silence. Once, a thick fog descended, and people on rafts and barges were clanging pots and pans to avoid being hit by steamboats as they moved along. A barge or raft passed so close to us that we could hear the people inside cursing and laughing \u2013 we could clearly understand what they were saying; but we couldn't see them for even a moment; this sent chills down our spines, as if we were listening to the voices of spirits gliding through the air.

It\u2019s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened. Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged it would have took too long to make so many. Jim said the moon could a laid them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn\u2019t say nothing against it, because I\u2019ve seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they\u2019d got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.",

Looking across the water, far away on the other side is the riverbank, and the island, and perhaps there is a light, a candle flame in the window frame. Sometimes there are also a few lights on the water's surface. Those are the lights on the rafts or ferries, and perhaps we can even hear the sound of a violin or singing echoing out. Living on a raft or a float, how interesting it is. Above us, there is only the high sky, dotted with stars, and we often lie on our backs looking up at the sky, debating with each other about who made those stars, and I just say they exist on their own. I said if someone made that many stars, it would surely take a lot of time. Jim said the moon gave birth to those stars. Well, it makes sense, so I couldn't say anything to refute that theory. And since I've seen frogs lay a lot of eggs, it could be that the moon gave birth to those stars. We also often look at shooting stars, watching their trails stretch down to the horizon. Jim said those are the bad stars, flying away from their nest.",

The sky above would be speckled with stars, and we would lie on our backs and watch the stars, debating whether they were made or if they appeared suddenly \u2013 according to Jim, they were made, but I thought they appeared suddenly; in my opinion, there were too many of them to be made one by one. Jim had said that the moon might have laid them; well, since this seemed reasonable, I didn't object, because I had seen a frog with as many offspring as there were stars, so this was something that could happen. We would also see shooting stars and watch them descend. According to Jim, these were the rotten ones and that's why they were picked out and fell from the nest.",

Their intentions didn't seem very good. We thought they were making a more diabolical plan than ever. After talking amongst ourselves many times, we decided that they were either going to rob someone's house or shop, or maybe even print counterfeit money. We were both scared of this, and we swore that we would never get involved in such crimes, even if it killed us; at the first opportunity, we would get rid of them and immediately escape, leaving them behind. In the morning, we hid our raft in a safe place about two miles down from a rundown town called Pikesville; the king went ashore and told us to hide until he scouted the town to see if there was any news of the Royal Nonesuch here. (\"That means until you find a house to rob,\" I muttered; \"then you'll come back here after robbing the house, and when you don't see anyone, you'll wonder what happened to me, Jim, and the raft... wonder all you want.\") The king also said that if he didn't return by noon, the duke and I should understand that everything was fine and go into town.",

Then we got really scared and decided that we wouldn't have anything to do with it, and that if the slightest opportunity arose, we would sneak away and abandon them. Well, one early morning we hid the raft in a good, safe spot, about two miles below a village called Pikesville, and the king went ashore and told us all to stay hidden while he went to town to see if anyone had found out about \"The Royal Nonesuch\" (\"a house to rob, that's what you mean,\" I said to myself, \"and when you're done robbing it, you're going to come back and wonder what happened to me and Jim and the raft, and you can wait for us sitting down\"). And he said that if he didn't come back by noon, the duke and I would know that everything was fine and we should meet up with him."

We talked, laughed, and sang on the raft drifting along the water. I couldn't find a single thing that made me hate Jim; on the contrary. Jim stood guard for me, and instead of waking me up, he let me sleep; Jim was happy and joyful when he saw me return safely; and Jim always called me by a dear name, indulged me, and would do anything for me.

I remembered how he took my watch after his own, how he couldn't bring himself to wake me up, how happy he was when I returned from the fog, how delighted he was when we met in the swamp where there was a blood feud; many similar things came to mind; he always called me the apple of his eye, patted my head, did everything he could think of for my comfort, always treated me well; lastly, I remembered the night I saved him by telling the men there were flowers on the raft, how grateful he was, how he said I was the best friend he had in this world, even his only friend now; as I thought about these things, I looked around and saw the paper.",
