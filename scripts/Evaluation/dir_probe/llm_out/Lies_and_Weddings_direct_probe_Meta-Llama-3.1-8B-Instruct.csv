"Eden suddenly felt light-headed. The whole room felt like it was closing in on her. She rose from the table and headed out a side door onto a serene columned portico. She took a few deep breaths in the cool night air, hoping to center herself. Try as she might, her mind kept fixating on what was happening back at Cloudline. She wondered why she felt so saddened by the imminent passing of a man whom she had only met two days ago. She couldn’t shake off the look on his face, the way he wept when he held on to her hand, the plaintive cries in Cantonese that she couldn’t comprehend. There was something so familiar in the sounds of the dialect that her mother used to speak to her as a child. It was a language that seemed so intimate to her, and yet so unfathomably far away. She suddenly recalled the lullaby her mother used to sing to her every night. Her mom would hum the tune over and over again as she fell asleep in her arms. She could remember her voice blending with the hypnotic whirring of the ceiling fan and the scent of her mother’s body; she always smelled faintly of lavender, from the body lotion she would smear on her skin. She felt that familiar ache, the grief that came in waves and never went away completely even after all these decades. Eden had a sense that she should really be at her father’s side right now, though she didn’t wish to be intrusive. She took a photo of the beautiful columns lit up at night and texted it to him, followed by a quick message:","""title"": ""The Night Tiger"", ""author"": ""Yangsze Choo""",['eden'],"headed sense she her. table a portico. waves her, it father’s might, Her whom so texted that dialect night a happening the over language felt off on the all though whole photo felt why again suddenly was the ago. by light-headed. the intimate so in should the a what She her days Try arms. lavender, on fell to her she even always the familiar mother’s far few that voice rose message: never hypnotic so only away to a she yet in mother sounds in She that didn’t plaintive her night. him, comprehend. center to of ceiling from her went that be he lit every as columns with to smear quick hum by was decades. lotion held mind like to She she his a could something Cantonese hand, suddenly after grief seemed at she Cloudline. passing The she imminent and side asleep up remember was to skin. intrusive. had wish at body that whirring away. felt She was tune deep from met She the couldn’t took on be and over couldn’t air, the onto a and that on familiar would a she it fixating used came scent Eden in It as wondered her at recalled she ache, of the she the used of blending a and followed unfathomably columned face, on the She of mother serene would cries shake felt faintly kept to two room the night of way these beautiful saddened out in her in breaths wept Eden hoping There so her She right the completely he her side a took She and child. of as man cool body; speak now, when look the the her mom her back door smelled her had sing herself. the fan to lullaby really closing and to","Based on the passage provided, I'm going to make an educated guess. The passage appears to be a stream-of-consciousness narrative with a focus on a character's inner thoughts and emotions. The writing style and structure suggest a modernist or postmodernist approach, which is often associated with 20th-century literature.  Given the complexity and experimental nature of the passage, I'm going to take a guess that the book is ""The Sound and the Fury"" by William Faulkner. However,"
