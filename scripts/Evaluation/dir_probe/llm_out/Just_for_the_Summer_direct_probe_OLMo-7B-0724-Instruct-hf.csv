"That night after work Maddy made dinner. Grilled portobello mushrooms and rice pilaf. I did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen, then took a shower and blew out my hair.","Based on the given passage, the source appears to be an episode of a television show or a personal account of a meal prepared by a character named Maddy. The passage does not contain enough context to definitively determine the title of the book or the author's name.
