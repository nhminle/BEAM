<t0>First Chapter</t0>
<t1>If you haven't read the book titled The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you wouldn't know me, but it doesn't matter.</t1> <t2>That book was written by Mr. Mark Twain, and he mostly tells the truth.</t2> <t3>He exaggerated some things, but what he said is mostly true.</t3> <t4>What does it matter anyway.</t4> <t5>One way or another, I haven't met anyone who doesn't lie, except Aunt Polly, and the widow lady, maybe Mary too.</t5> <t6>Aunt Polly – that is, Tom's Aunt Polly – and Mary, and also the Widow Douglas are mentioned in that book; as I said earlier, mostly true things are said in the book, but there are also exaggerated parts.</t6>
<t7>At the end of that book, the situation was like this: Tom and I had found the money the robbers hid in the cave and had become rich.</t7> <t8>Each of us had six thousand dollars – all in gold.</t8> <t9>When you piled up the money somewhere, you couldn't take your eyes off it.</t9> <t10>Judge Thatcher took the money and invested it at interest, so we earned a dollar every day throughout the year – so much money that one wouldn't know where to spend it.</t10> <t11>Miss Douglas adopted me like her own child and thought she could make a gentleman out of me, but staying at home all the time was not easy at all, moreover, the widow was so meticulous and proper in every way that it was enough to drive a person crazy; so when I couldn't stand it any longer, I ran away.</t11> <t12>I returned to my old rags and my sugar barrel; now I was free, I was happy.</t12> <t13>But Tom Sawyer tracked me down and found me and said he was going to form a robbery gang.</t13> <t14>If I went back to the widow and became respectable, I could join too.</t14> <t15>So I went back.</t15>
<t16>When the widow saw me, she opened her arms with tears in her eyes, called me a poor lost lamb, and gave me many other names, but there was no malice in it.</t16> <t17>She dressed me in new clothes again.</t17> <t18>I sweated and sweated, and moreover, I couldn't move.</t18> <t19>Thus, our old life started again.</t19> <t20>The widow would ring a bell for dinner, and you had to be on time for the meal.</t20> <t21>When you sat at the table, you couldn't start eating right away; you had to wait for the widow to bow her head and mutter something about the meal; although there was nothing wrong with the meal.</t21> <t22>In fact, each dish was cooked separately.</t22> <t23>However, if you threw them all into one pot over the fire, it wouldn't be the same; everything would mix together, and the juices would blend with everything; that's what I call a meal.</t23>
<t24>After the meal, he would take out his book and teach me the story of Moses and the Reeds.</t24> <t25>I was working diligently to learn everything about Moses, but then he let slip that Moses had died quite some time ago; so I lost all interest in him, because I don't concern myself with the affairs of the dead.</t25>
<t26>After a while, I craved some tobacco and asked the widow for permission.</t26> <t27>She was adamant and wouldn't budge.</t27> <t28>She said it was a bad habit, that it made the surroundings dirty, and that I should make an effort to quit.</t28> <t29>Some people are just like that.</t29> <t30>They criticize what they don't understand.</t30> <t31>She was fixated on Moses, even though the man wasn't a relative or anything, he was of no use to anyone, he had passed away; yet she found all sorts of faults in me for engaging in a somewhat virtuous activity.</t31> <t32>Moreover, she herself used snuff, but of course, that was fine because she was the one doing it.</t32>
<t33>He also had a sister, Miss Watson.</t33> <t34>Miss Watson, an elderly, never-married, very thin woman who wore huge glasses, had recently come to live with him, and this time she stood over me with a spelling book in her hand.</t34> <t35>After making me work diligently for nearly an hour, the widow told her to take a break.</t35> <t36>Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to endure it any longer.</t36> <t37>The next hour was so stifling that I couldn't sit still anymore.</t37> <t38>Miss Watson kept saying, "Don't put your feet there, Huckleberry," and "Don't slouch, Huckleberry... sit up straight," and after a while, she started saying, "Don't yawn and stretch, Huckleberry... why don't you try to sit properly?"</t38> <t39>Then she told me everything about the bad place, and I said I wanted to be there.</t39> <t40>When I said that, she went crazy, but I didn't mean any harm.</t40> <t41>All I wanted was to go somewhere; I just wanted a change, it wasn't about going to a specific place.</t41> <t42>She said it was a sin to say that, that she would never say such a thing in this world; she intended to live in a way that she could go to the good place.</t42> <t43>Well, I couldn't see any good in going where she was going, so I decided not to bother trying for it.</t43> <t44>But I didn't say that, because it would only get me into trouble.</t44>
<t45>Now that he had started talking, he began to tell everything he knew about the good place.</t45> <t46>According to him, the only thing a person had to do there was to wander around all day, playing the harp and singing songs, forever, without ever stopping.</t46> <t47>So, it didn't seem like a place worth going to.</t47> <t48>But I definitely didn't express this.</t48> <t49>I asked if Tom Sawyer could go there too, and it seemed he definitely couldn't.</t49> <t50>I was happy about this because I didn't want us to ever be separated.</t50>
<t51>While Mrs. Watson was listing her advice and scoldings one after another, I felt increasingly exhausted and lonely.</t51> <t52>Soon after, they brought in the black slaves and started praying, then everyone retired to their beds.</t52> <t53>I took a candle and went to my room, placing the candle on the table.</t53> <t54>I sat on a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it didn't work at all.</t54> <t55>I felt so utterly alone that I wished I were dead.</t55> <t56>The stars were shining brightly and the leaves in the forest were rustling mournfully, I heard an owl hooting in the distance; it was saying puuu-huuu for someone who had died; also, a whip-poor-will and a dog were howling to announce that someone nearby was going to die; the wind was trying to whisper something to me, but I couldn't understand what it was, so a cold shiver ran down my spine.</t56> <t57>Then, from the depths of the forest, I heard a sound like that made by ghosts who, unable to convey their troubles, leave their graves in despair and wander around every evening in torment.</t57> <t58>I was so demoralized and so scared that I wished someone were with me.</t58> <t59>Soon after, a spider started climbing up my shoulder, and when I flicked it, it fell onto the candle; before I could even move, it was scorched.</t59> <t60>No one needed to tell me that this was a terribly bad omen and would bring me bad luck, I started trembling like a leaf out of fear.</t60> <t61>I stood up and turned around three times, making the sign of the cross each time; then I tied a piece of string to a lock of my hair to keep the witches away.</t61> <t62>But I still didn't feel at ease.</t62> <t63>You know how when you find a horseshoe but lose it before you can nail it above the door, you do this, but I had never heard of anything you could do to ward off bad luck when you kill a spider.</t63>
<t64>Shivering violently, I sat down again and took out my pipe to smoke; because now there was a deathly silence in the house, and not even the spirit of the widow would hear me smoking.</t64> <t65>Anyway, after a long time, I heard the town clock strike twelve with a tonk-tonk-tonk, and then silence fell again, the surroundings were even quieter than before.</t65> <t66>Shortly after, I heard a branch break in the darkness among the trees – something was stirring.</t66> <t67>I sat quietly and listened intently.</t67> <t68>From below, a faint “Meow! Meow!” sound was heard.</t68> <t69>That was good!</t69> <t70>I also said as quietly as possible, “Meow! Meow!”, then blew out the candle and stepped out onto the veranda through the window.</t70> <t71>Slipping down from the veranda, I started crawling among the trees and, of course, found Tom Sawyer waiting for me there.</t71>
<t72>Second Chapter</t72>
<t73>We dove into a path winding to the back through the trees to exit the old lady's garden, bending low to avoid getting our heads caught in the branches, and tiptoeing to avoid making any noise.</t73> <t74>As we passed by the kitchen, I tripped over a root, making a bit of noise.</t74> <t75>We immediately crouched down and stayed completely still.</t75> <t76>Mrs. Watson's big, burly black slave named Jim was sitting on the threshold of the kitchen door; we could see him clearly because the light was shining behind him.</t76> <t77>He stood up and stretched his neck to listen around for a while.</t77> <t78>Then he called out:</t78>
<t79>“Who is there?</t79><t80>”</t80>
<t81>He listened a little more; then he came on tiptoe and stood right between the two of us, we could touch him if we reached out, that's how close he was.</t81> <t82>The three of us stayed there, so close together, for maybe minutes without a sound.</t82> <t83>A spot near my ankle started to itch, but I couldn't risk scratching it, then my ear started to itch; then an itch appeared right in the middle of my back, between my shoulder blades.</t83> <t84>If I didn't scratch, I would almost die right there.</t84> <t85>Such things had happened to me many times before.</t85> <t86>If you're around polite people, at a funeral, or trying to sleep even though you're not sleepy – in short, if you're in a place where it's not appropriate to scratch, thousands of places on your body start to itch.</t86> <t87>A little later, Jim called out again:</t87>
<t88>“Who is there?</t88> <t89>Where are you?</t89> <t90>If I haven't heard anything, let me be damned.</t90> <t91>Alright, I know what to do.</t91> <t92>I'll sit here and wait to hear it again.</t92><t93>”</t93>
<t94>Thus, he collapsed to the ground between Tom and me.</t94> <t95>He leaned his back against a tree and stretched his legs out so far that they almost touched one of mine.</t95> <t96>My nose started to itch.</t96> <t97>It itched so much that my eyes watered.</t97> <t98>But I couldn't muster the courage to scratch it.</t98> <t99>Then an itch started inside my nose.</t99> <t100>Next thing I knew, my lower parts were itching.</t100> <t101>I didn't know how I was going to keep still without moving.</t101> <t102>This ordeal must have lasted six or seven minutes; but it felt much longer to me.</t102> <t103>By now, eleven different parts of my body were itching.</t103> <t104>I felt like I couldn't endure another minute, but I gritted my teeth and prepared to hold on a bit longer.</t104> <t105>Just then, Jim's breathing grew heavier; then he started to snore – and with that, I scratched myself freely.</t105>
<t106>Tom gave me a signal – he made a soft sound with his mouth – then we began to crawl away on our hands and knees.</t106> <t107>After moving three or four meters away, Tom whispered that he wanted to tie Jim to a tree for fun; but I said no; he could wake up and make a noise, and they would realize I wasn't inside.</t107> <t108>Then Tom said he didn't have enough candles with him and suggested quietly going into the kitchen to get some more.</t108> <t109>I didn't want him to attempt such a thing.</t109> <t110>I said Jim could wake up and come.</t110> <t111>But Tom wanted to take the risk; so we slipped inside and took three candles.</t111> <t112>Tom left five cents on the table for the candles.</t112> <t113>When we got outside, I wanted to get away as soon as possible, but it was impossible to stop Tom.</t113> <t114>He crawled on his hands and knees to where Jim was and did something to him.</t114> <t115>The surroundings were so quiet and deserted that it felt like I had waited for quite a long time.</t115>
<t116>As soon as Tom returned, we set off, circled the garden fence, and then climbed to the steep summit of the hill on the other side of the house.</t116> <t117>Tom told me that Jim had taken off his hat and hung it on a branch right above him.</t117> <t118>Jim had stirred a little, but he hadn't woken up.</t118> <t119>Later, Jim said that witches had cast a spell on him and made him pass out.</t119> <t120>They had ridden on his back all around the State; they brought him back under the trees and hung his hat on a branch to show him who had done it.</t120> <t121>The next time, Jim said they had taken him all the way to New Orleans: In his later recountings, he said he went farther each time, and finally, he started saying they had ridden him all around the world until he was dead tired and had sores on his back.</t121> <t122>Jim was immensely proud of all that had happened, and he even looked down on the other black people because of it.</t122> <t123>Black people came from miles away to listen to Jim's story, and he had become the most respected black slave in the area.</t123> <t124>Black people who saw him for the first time stared in amazement with their mouths open, scrutinizing him from head to toe as if he were a miracle.</t124> <t125>Black people liked to talk about witches by the stove in the kitchen when it got dark, but now whenever someone started talking about it and claimed to know everything, Jim would immediately interrupt and ask, "Huh! What do you know about witches?" and that black person couldn't continue and had to back down.</t125> <t126>Jim also wore the five cents we had left him on a string around his neck and said that the devil had given it to him with his own hand.</t126> <t127>With this charm, he could heal anyone he wanted and summon witches with a single word whenever he wished; but, of course, he never said what that word was.</t127> <t128>Black people came from all around and gave Jim whatever they had just to see the five cents; but they couldn't touch it, because the devil's hand had touched it.</t128> <t129>Jim had almost become unable to serve, because he was so puffed up with pride for having seen the devil and carried witches on his back.</t129>
<t130>Anyway, when Tom and I reached the top of the hill, we turned and looked at the town and saw three or four lights on.</t130> <t131>There were probably sick people around there; also, the stars were shining a tremendous light from above.</t131> <t132>The river started below the town.</t132> <t133>The river, almost two kilometers wide, was as smooth as a sheet and unbelievably magnificent.</t133> <t134>When we descended the hill, we found Jo Harper, Ben Rogers, and two or three of the other boys hiding in the old tannery.</t134> <t135>We all untied a small boat, got in, and went down the river, traveling four kilometers until we reached that big rock on the hillside, and then we went ashore again.</t135>
<t136>We went over to a clump of bushes, and after Tom made everyone swear to keep it a secret, he showed them the hole that went into the hill where the bushes were thickest.</t136> <t137>We lit the candles and crawled inside.</t137> <t138>After moving forward for about two hundred meters, the cave widened.</t138> <t139>After checking some passages, Tom disappeared from sight by going under a wall that didn't appear to have a hole from the outside.</t139> <t140>We also passed through a narrow passage and emerged into a very damp, airless, cool chamber and stopped.</t140> <t141>Tom began to speak:</t141>
<t142>“Alright, brother, we are now forming this gang of robbers, and we will name it Tom Sawyer's Gang.</t142> <t143>Everyone who wants to join must take an oath and write their name in blood.</t143><t144>”</t144>
<t145>Everyone was already willing since yesterday.</t145> <t146>Tom took out the paper on which he had written the oath and began to read.</t146> <t147>According to what was written, each child would remain loyal to the gang and would not tell their secrets to anyone; if someone harmed one of the children in the gang, the child who was given the order would have to kill the person who caused the harm and their family, and it was forbidden to eat or sleep without carving the cross mark, which was the gang's symbol, on their chests after killing them all.</t147> <t148>No one who did not belong to the gang could use this cross mark; if they did, they would be sued, and if they used it again, they would have to be killed.</t148> <t149>If any member of the gang revealed the secrets, their throat would be cut, their body would be burned, and after their ashes were scattered in all directions, their name on the list would be covered in blood.</t149> <t150>No one from the gang would ever mention their name again, they would be cursed and forgotten forever.</t150>
<t151>Everyone said the oath was really beautiful and some asked if Tom had made it up himself.</t151> <t152>He had made up part of it, but the rest came from books about pirates and outlaws, and every distinguished gang had such an oath.</t152>
<t153>There were those who thought it would be good to also kill the families of the children who revealed the secrets.</t153> <t154>Tom said it was a good idea, took a pen, and added it immediately.</t154>
<t155>Then Ben Rogers said, "But Huck Finn is also here, he has no family...</t155> <t156>So what are we going to do with him?" he asked.</t156>
<t157>“Doesn't he have a father?” said Tom Sawyer.</t157>
<t158>“Yes, his father was around; but these days it's impossible to find him.</t158> <t159>He used to drink and pass out among the pigs at the tannery, but he hasn't been seen around here for over a year.</t159><t160>”</t160>
<t161>It was debated at length, they almost excluded me from the gang because they said every child should have a family or an elder to be killed.</t161> <t162>Otherwise, this condition of the oath wouldn't be fair to the others.</t162> <t163>No one could think of a solution – everyone had run out of ideas and were sitting around dejectedly.</t163> <t164>I was on the verge of tears too, but suddenly a solution came to my mind and I suggested Mrs. Watson to them – they could kill her.</t164>
<t165>“Ah, of course that will do,” everyone said.</t165> <t166>“Alright then.</t166> <t167>Huck can join too.</t167><t168>”</t168>
<t169>Then everyone pricked their finger with a needle to draw blood for the signature, and I also placed my mark on the paper.</t169>
<t170>“Now,” said Ben Rogers, “In which area will this gang operate?</t170><t171>”</t171>
<t172>“Nothing, just robbery and murder,” said Tom.</t172>
<t173>“Alright, but whom are we going to rob?</t173> <t174>The houses… the cattle… or…</t174><t175>”</t175>
<t176>"No way!</t176> <t177>Stealing cattle and similar things is not robbery, it's theft," said Tom Sawyer.</t177> <t178>"We are not thieves.</t178> <t179>Theft is against the code.</t179> <t180>We are highwaymen.</t180> <t181>We put on our masks, stop mail and stagecoaches, kill people and take their watches and money.</t181><t182>"</t182>
<t183>"Do we always have to kill people, brother?"</t183><t184></t184>
<t185>“Of course, definitely.</t185> <t186>This is the best.</t186> <t187>Some of the experts speak otherwise; but it is generally said that the best is to kill them.</t187> <t188>However, we can bring some of them to the cave and keep them here until the ransoms we want are paid.</t188><t189>”</t189>
<t190>“Ransom? </t190><t191>What is that?”</t191>
<t192>"I don't know.</t192> <t193>But that's what robbers do.</t193> <t194>It's written in almost all the books.</t194> <t195>So, this is what we should do too.</t195><t196>"</t196>
<t197>“So how will we do it if we don't know what it is?</t197><t198>”</t198>
<t199>“Ah, but you're annoying, we have to do it, didn't I tell you that's what the book says?</t199> <t200>Do you want to do things differently from what's written in the book and then mess everything up?</t200><t201>”</t201>
<t202>“Huh, easy to say, Tom Sawyer, but can you tell me how we are going to get a ransom without knowing how to do it?</t202> <t203>That's what I'm trying to get to.</t203> <t204>Now, what do you think this ransom thing is?</t204><t205>”</t205>
<t206>"We said we don't know.</t206> <t207>But if we are to keep them here until the ransom is paid, it means we will keep them until they die.</t207><t208>"</t208>
<t209>“Now that's a meaningful statement.</t209> <t210>I can't say anything against that.</t210> <t211>Would it have killed you to say it earlier?</t211> <t212>We will keep them here until they die and their ransoms are paid…</t212> <t213>Although we will be in trouble, because they will consume everything we have and constantly try to escape.</t213><t214>”</t214>
<t215>“Don't talk nonsense, Ben Rogers! How would they try to escape if we posted a guard who would shoot them the moment they moved a hair?”</t215><t216>”</t216>
<t217>“It means a guard.</t217> <t218>This is good.</t218> <t219>So someone will stay up all night and keep an eye on them without sleeping.</t219> <t220>I think this is foolish.</t220> <t221>Why don't we just grab a stick and release them for ransom as soon as we bring them here?</t221><t222>”</t222>
<t223>“Because that's not how it's written in the books...</t223> <t224>that's why.</t224> <t225>Ben Rogers, my brother, do you want to do this by the book or not?</t225> <t226>That's the issue.</t226> <t227>Do you think the people who write the books don't know what's right and what's wrong?</t227> <t228>Are you going to teach them their job?</t228> <t229>I don't think so.</t229> <t230>No, my dear, we will do it by the rules and take a ransom to release them.</t230><t231>”</t231>
<t232>“Alright.</t232> <t233>It's not that big of a deal, but if you ask me, it's utter stupidity, anyway.</t233> <t234>By the way… are we going to kill the women too?</t234><t235>”</t235>
<t236>"If I were as ignorant as you, I wouldn't open my mouth so much, Ben Rogers.</t236> <t237>Killing women, huh?</t237> <t238>No; no one has ever seen anything like that written in books until now.</t238> <t239>You take them to the cave, always treat them very politely; over time, they fall in love with you and never want to go back home.</t239><t240>"</t240>
<t241>“If that's the case, it's fine by me, but I still wouldn't trust its accuracy if I were you.</t241> <t242>In a short time, the cave would be filled with women and men waiting for their ransom to be paid, leaving no room for the robbers.</t242> <t243>But go ahead, continue, I have nothing more to say.</t243><t244>”</t244>
<t245>Little Tommy Barnes had fallen asleep, and when they woke him up, he got scared, started crying, said he missed his home and his mother, and that he no longer wanted to be a robber.</t245>
<t246>Everyone made fun of him, calling him a crybaby.</t246> <t247>Upon this, he got very angry and immediately said he would go and reveal all the secrets.</t247> <t248>But Tom gave him five cents to keep quiet and said that we would all go home now, and next week we would meet again to rob someone and kill a few people.</t248>
<t249>Ben Rogers said that he couldn't go out very often, but he was available on Sundays.</t249> <t250>Therefore, he wanted us to start next Sunday; but when the other children reminded him that doing such things on Sunday was a sin, that idea was also abandoned.</t250> <t251>They decided to get together at the first opportunity to set a date, then we set off home after electing Tom Sawyer as the captain of the gang and Jo Harper as the second captain.</t251>
<t252>Just before dawn, I climbed up the veranda and slipped inside through the window.</t252> <t253>My brand-new clothes were covered in oil and mud, and I was utterly exhausted.</t253>
<t254>Chapter Three</t254>
<t255>In the morning, I got a good scolding from our Miss Watson because of the state of my clothes; but the widow didn't get mad at all, though she looked so sad while cleaning the grease and dirt that I decided to try to behave for a while if I could.</t255> <t256>Then Miss Watson took me into the closet and prayed, but it still didn't do any good.</t256> <t257>She told me that if I prayed every day, I would get everything I wanted.</t257> <t258>But I didn't get anything.</t258> <t259>I tried.</t259> <t260>Once, I had a fishing line, but no hook.</t260> <t261>Without a hook, the line was useless.</t261> <t262>I tried praying for a fishing hook three or four times, but it never worked.</t262> <t263>Then one day, I asked Miss Watson to try it for me, but she said I was a fool.</t263> <t264>She never explained why, and I couldn't make any sense of it.</t264>
<t265>Once, when I went to the forest, I sat down and thought about this for a long time.</t265> <t266>If a person can obtain something by praying, why can't the assistant pastor Winn get back the money he lost in the pork trade?</t266> <t267>Why can't the widow find her stolen silver snuffbox?</t267> <t268>Why can't Mrs. Watson gain weight?</t268> <t269>No, I said to myself, there's no way that thing called prayer works.</t269> <t270>I went and told the widow about this, and she said that a person can only gain "spiritual gifts" by praying.</t270> <t271>I couldn't grasp this much, but then she explained it clearly – I should help other people, do everything I can for others, constantly look out for them, and never think of myself.</t271> <t272>As far as I understood, this included Mrs. Watson as well.</t272> <t273>I went back to the forest and pondered this for a long time, but I couldn't see any good in it – that is, it only benefited others.</t273> <t274>Finally, I decided not to bother myself with this anymore and to let everything take its course.</t274> <t275>From time to time, the widow would pull me aside and speak about God in a way that made my mouth water; but maybe the very next day, Mrs. Watson would catch me and tell me the opposite of everything I had learned.</t275> <t276>In the end, I concluded that there were two Gods.</t276> <t277>A poor boy couldn't get enough of listening to the widow's God, but if he fell into the hands of Mrs. Watson's God, he had no chance.</t277> <t278>After thinking about all this over and over, I decided to belong to the widow's God, if He would accept me.</t278> <t279>Though I didn't know if this God would treat me any better than before; because I was very ignorant, ordinary, and from the lower class.</t279>
<t280>It had been over a year since my father disappeared, and this suited me just fine; I no longer wanted to see him.</t280> <t281>If he caught me while sober, he would trample me underfoot, but when he was around, I would always run away and hide in the forest.</t281> <t282>At one point, they said he was found drowned in the river about twenty kilometers upstream from the town.</t282> <t283>More precisely, they guessed that the person they found was my father, because the drowned man was exactly his height, looked very disheveled, and had unusually long hair – they were describing my father exactly – but they couldn't identify him by his face; because he had been in the water so long that his face had become unrecognizable.</t283> <t284>They said he was found floating on his back.</t284> <t285>They immediately took him out of the water and buried him on the shore.</t285> <t286>But the relief I felt didn't last long, because something important came to my mind.</t286> <t287>I knew very well that a drowned man would turn face down, not face up.</t287> <t288>So, the drowned person was not my father, but a woman dressed like a man.</t288> <t289>My peace was disturbed again.</t289> <t290>I was no longer in doubt that he would eventually show up, but deep down, I wished he would never come back.</t290>
<t291>We played at being robbers whenever we found time for a month, then I left the gang.</t291><t292>All the children left.</t292><t293>We hadn't robbed anyone, we hadn't killed anyone, we had just pretended to rob and kill.</t293><t294>We would suddenly emerge from the forest and attack pig herders or the carts of women taking vegetables and fruits to the market, but we never captured any of them.</t294><t295>Tom Sawyer called pigs "gold bars" and turnips or similar things "jewels."</t295><t296>Then we would return to the cave and tell each other what we had done; we would talk about the many people we had killed and marked.</t296><t297>But I couldn't understand what good it would do us.</t297><t298>Once, Tom made one of the boys run through the town with a burning torch in his hand.</t298><t299>He said it was a password (a signal for the gang to gather).</t299><t300>Then he claimed he had received secret information from his spies.</t300><t301>The next day, a lot of Spanish merchants and rich Arabs were supposed to camp at Rocky Cave with two hundred elephants, six hundred camels, and over a thousand mules.</t301><t302>All the animals were loaded with diamonds and they had no guards other than four hundred soldiers.</t302><t303>So, as he put it, we would ambush them and kill everyone and plunder the goods.</t303><t304>He said we needed to take care of our swords and weapons and get ready.</t304><t305>He couldn't even keep up with a turnip cart, but he made sure we cleaned our swords and weapons; and these were just sticks and broom handles, no matter how much you scrubbed them, they didn't look any different than before.</t305><t306>I didn't believe we could defeat that crowd of Spaniards and Arabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so the next day, which was Saturday, I was among those who ambushed; when the order was given, we jumped out from the trees and started running down the hill.</t306><t307>But there were no Spaniards or Arabs down there, no camels or elephants either.</t307><t308>All we found down there was a picnic of the Sunday school, and it was just a picnic for the first graders.</t308><t309>Still, we surprised them and chased the children to the rocks; but we didn't get anything except some buns and jam, although Ben Rogers got a rag doll, Jo Harper got a hymn book and a pamphlet; then their teacher attacked and we had to run away, leaving all the loot behind.</t309><t310>I didn't see any diamonds around and I told Tom Sawyer that.</t310><t311>But he said there were sacks of diamonds down there, and there were Arabs too, even elephants and such.</t311><t312>Then why didn't we see them, I asked.</t312><t313>If I wasn't so ignorant and had read this book called Don Quixote, I wouldn't even need to ask.</t313><t314>He said it was all done with magic.</t314><t315>There were hundreds of soldiers, elephants, and treasure there, but we had enemies whom Tom called magicians, and just to annoy us, they had turned all of it into a Sunday school picnic for little kids in the blink of an eye.</t315><t316>Alright then, I said, what we need to do is defeat those magicians.</t316><t317>Tom Sawyer said I was a complete blockhead.</t317>
<t318>“Wizards can summon a bunch of jinns at once, and before you can say Jack Robinson, the jinns will chop you into pieces.</t318> <t319>These jinns are said to be as tall as trees and as wide as a church building.</t319><t320>”</t320>
<t321>“Then let's find some jinn to help us,” I said.</t321> <t322>“Then can't we defeat the other jinn?</t322><t323>”</t323>
<t324>“So where will we find them?</t324><t325>”</t325>
<t326>"I don't know, where did they find it?"</t326><t327></t327>
<t328>“They rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring; then the genies suddenly appear.</t328> <t329>Meanwhile, lightning flashes around, thunder strikes, and smoke rises.</t329> <t330>The genies have to do everything they are told.</t330> <t331>Uprooting a shot tower from its roots and then hitting the head of the Sunday school teacher or someone else with it is no big deal for them.</t331><t332>”</t332>
<t333>“Who is causing them to run around like this?</t333><t334>”</t334>
<t335>“The one who rubs the lamp or the ring is him.</t335> <t336>They belong to the person who rubs the lamp or the ring and are obliged to do everything he says.</t336> <t337>If he tells them to build a sixty-five-kilometer-long palace made of diamond, and then fill it with gum or whatever he desires, and also wants to bring the daughter of the Chinese emperor to marry her, they have to do it all – and they have to do it before the sun rises the next day.</t337> <t338>Moreover, they should take that palace to wherever in the country you want, that is, wherever you want, do you understand?</t338><t339>”</t339>
<t340>“Alright,” I said, “if you ask me, these jinn are quite foolish; instead of moving the palace from place to place, they should have kept it for themselves, my brother.</t340> <t341>Moreover... if I were in their place, instead of dropping everything and running to him, I would have sent the man who rubbed the lamp to Jericho.</t341><t342>”</t342>
<t343>"You have no brains, Huck Finn.</t343> <t344>You have to come when he rubs it, whether you want to or not.</t344><t345>"</t345>
<t346>“No way, despite being as tall as a tree and as big as a church building?</t346> <t347>If that's the case, I would have come, but I swear I would have made that man climb to the top of the tallest tree in the country.</t347><t348>”</t348>
<t349>“Man, trying to explain things to you is harder than getting a camel through the eye of a needle, Huck Finn.</t349> <t350>Doesn't a person know anything at all…</t350> <t351>you're just a complete fool.</t351><t352>”</t352>
<t353>I thought about this issue for two or three days, then I decided to see for myself whether it was real or not.</t353> <t354>I took an old tin lamp and an iron ring and went to the forest to start rubbing them.</t354> <t355>I kept rubbing until I was drenched in sweat with the hope of having a palace built and then selling it, but it was all in vain; none of the genies appeared.</t355> <t356>At that point, I concluded that all of this was just Tom Sawyer's inventions.</t356> <t357>He probably believed in Arabs and elephants, but I thought differently.</t357> <t358>In my opinion, the spirit of Sunday school was infused into everything he told.</t358>
<t359>Fourth Chapter</t359>
<t360>Three or four more months passed like this, and we had now fully entered winter.</t360> <t361>Most of the time, I was at school and had learned to count the letters of words, to read, and to write a little bit.</t361> <t362>The multiplication table was memorized up to six times seven equals thirty-five, but I didn't think I could go any further even if I lived forever.</t362> <t363>Anyway, I didn't care much about mathematics.</t363>
<t364>At first, I hated school, but over time it became more bearable.</t364> <t365>Whenever I got fed up, I would skip school, and the beating I received the next day would actually do me good; it would lift my spirits a bit.</t365> <t366>As I continued attending school, it started to seem not so difficult anymore.</t366> <t367>I was also getting used to the widow's way of life, and I wasn't feeling as restless anymore.</t367> <t368>Living in a house and sleeping in a bed usually suffocated me, but before the weather turned cold, I had occasionally snuck out at night to sleep in the forest, taking a bit of a break.</t368> <t369>I loved my old life more, but I had also started to like my new life a little.</t369> <t370>The widow said that I was progressing slowly but surely, and that my development was very satisfying.</t370> <t371>She wasn't ashamed of me at all.</t371>
<t372>One morning while having breakfast, I accidentally knocked over the salt shaker.</t372> <t373>I immediately reached out to take a pinch of the spilled salt and throw it over my left shoulder to ward off bad luck, but Miss Watson was quicker and blocked my way.</t373> <t374>“Get your hands off, Huckleberry,” she said.</t374> <t375>“You’re always making a mess everywhere.”</t375> <t376>The widow said a few kind words on my behalf, but I knew very well that those words wouldn’t keep the bad luck away.</t376> <t377>After breakfast, I was anxious and uneasy.</t377> <t378>It was uncertain where and how the bad luck would catch up with me.</t378> <t379>There are ways to avoid some bad luck, but this time it was a different kind of bad luck.</t379> <t380>So I didn’t bother myself, just wandered around moodily and stayed alert.</t380>
<t381>I went out to the front yard, climbed the gate, and crossed to the other side of the fence.</t381> <t382>The thickness of the snow on the ground had reached a few centimeters, and someone's footprints were clearly visible.</t382> <t383>The tracks were coming from the quarry, had lingered a bit by the gate, and then circled around the fence.</t383> <t384>It was strange that after waiting so long, they didn't enter.</t384> <t385>I couldn't make sense of it.</t385> <t386>For some reason, I was very curious.</t386> <t387>I was going to follow them, but first, I bent down and looked at the tracks carefully; at first, nothing caught my eye, but then I saw something familiar.</t387> <t388>A cross made of large nails to keep the devil away was on the heel of the left boot.</t388>
<t389>I immediately broke the bowstring and ran down the slope without stopping.</t389> <t390>I frequently turned my head to look back, but I didn't see anyone.</t390> <t391>Without slowing down at all, I went straight to Judge Thatcher's house.</t391>
<t392>“What's the matter, son, you're out of breath,” he said.</t392> <t393>“Did you come for the interest?</t393><t394>”</t394>
<t395>“No, sir,” I said, “was there any interest?”</t395><t396>”</t396>
<t397>“Of course, the six-month interest came in last night.</t397> <t398>More than one hundred and fifty dollars.</t398> <t399>It counts as a fortune for you.</t399> <t400>It's best to invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it, you'll squander it away.</t400><t401>”</t401>
<t402>“No; sir,” I said, “I don't want to spend it.</t402> <t403>In fact, I don't want it at all…</t403> <t404>I don't want the six thousand either.</t404> <t405>I want you to take all of it; I want to give it to you…</t405> <t406>the six thousand and all the rest of it.</t406><t407>”</t407>
<t408>He looked surprised.</t408> <t409>He seemed like he didn't understand what I wanted to do.</t409>
<t410>“Hey, what do you mean, my dear?” she said.</t410>
<t411>“Please don't ask me questions about this, please.</t411> <t412>You will take it… won't you?</t412><t413>”</t413>
<t414>“Honestly, I was quite surprised by this,” he said.</t414> <t415>“Is there a problem?</t415><t416>”</t416>
<t417>“Please take it and don't ask me anything,” I said.</t417> <t418>“If you don't ask, I won't have to make up a lie.</t418><t419>”</t419>
<t420>After thinking for a while, he said:</t420>
<t421>“Haa.</t421> <t422>Now I think I understand.</t422> <t423>You want to sell me all your goods… not give them.</t423> <t424>This would be more accurate.</t424><t425>”</t425>
<t426>After writing something on a piece of paper and reading it from start to finish, he continued:</t426>
<t427>“Let's see... as you can see, it says 'for a price.'</t427> <t428>So I bought it from you and paid you the price.</t428> <t429>Here's a dollar.</t429> <t430>Come on, sign here.</t430><t431>”</t431>
<t432>I signed and left there.</t432>
<t433>Jim, Watson's black man, had a ball of hair the size of a fist.</t433><t434>He had taken the ball from the fourth stomach of an ox and used it for magic.</t434><t435>He claimed that it had a spirit inside and knew everything.</t435><t436>That night, I went to him and told him that my father had returned because I had seen his footprints in the snow.</t436><t437>I wanted to know what he was going to do, would he stay?</t437><t438>Jim took out the ball of hair and said something to it, then lifted it up and dropped it to the ground.</t438><t439>The ball looked very solid and only rolled a few centimeters.</t439><t440>Jim tried again and again, and each time the ball did the same thing.</t440><t441>Jim knelt down, put his ear to the ball, and listened.</t441><t442>But it was no use; he said the ball wouldn't talk.</t442><t443>Sometimes it wouldn't talk unless money was given.</t443><t444>I said I had an old, smooth counterfeit quarter, but it was useless because its silver had worn off, revealing a yellowish color underneath; moreover, even if the yellow wasn't visible, it wouldn't pass because it was too slippery and looked oily, it was obviously fake.</t444><t445>(I definitely wasn't going to mention the dollar I got from the judge.</t445><t446>)</t446><t447>I said it was quite a bad coin, but maybe the ball of hair would take it, because it might not know the difference.</t447><t448>Jim sniffed the coin, bit it, rubbed it, and said it would work because he knew a way to trick the ball of hair into thinking the coin was real.</t448><t449>He would cut a raw potato in half, put the quarter in between, and keep it there all night.</t449><t450>By morning, the yellow would no longer be visible, the coin wouldn't be slippery, and not only the ball of hair but everyone in town would take the coin without a second thought.</t450><t451>I knew that potatoes worked for this before, but I had forgotten.</t451>
<t452>Jim placed the quarter under the ball of hair and knelt down to listen again.</t452> <t453>This time, he said the ball of hair was working.</t453> <t454>He said it could tell me my entire future if I wanted.</t454> <t455>I said I wanted it to tell me.</t455> <t456>So the ball of hair talked to Jim, and Jim told me the fortune.</t456> <t457>He said:</t457>
<t458>“Your father doesn't know what to do now.</t458> <t459>Sometimes he thinks of leaving, sometimes he says he'll stay.</t459> <t460>If it's best to leave it empty, let the man run his own course.</t460> <t461>Two angels are hovering above his head.</t461> <t462>One is white, it ties, the other is black.</t462> <t463>The white one calls him to the right path for a while, then the black one comes out and ruins everything.</t463> <t464>One day, one of them will take him in their palm, but which one is unknown.</t464> <t465>But your fortune is open.</t465> <t466>Throughout your life, you will see a lot of suffering, but there will also be much joy.</t466> <t467>Sometimes you will get wet, sometimes you will get sick, but you will always be well in the end.</t467> <t468>There are two girls in your life.</t468> <t469>One is white, one is dark.</t469> <t470>One is rich, one is poor.</t470> <t471>First, you will marry the poor one, then the rich one.</t471> <t472>You avoid water, you feel distant from it, and if there's a risk of hanging, you don't take the risk.</t472><t473>”</t473>
<t474>That night, when I lit the candle and went up to my room, I found my father in front of me, it was him!</t474>
<t475>Chapter Five</t475>
<t476>I had closed the door behind me.</t476> <t477>Then I turned the other way and there it was.</t477> <t478>I was always afraid of it, it used to beat me a lot.</t478> <t479>I thought I was still afraid, but I realized I was wrong a little later…</t479> <t480>that is, after overcoming the initial shock, when I started breathing again, I immediately understood that I wasn't really that afraid of it.</t480>
<t481>He was almost fifty years old, and he looked his age.</t481> <t482>His long, greasy, and disheveled hair fell over his face, making his eyes shine as if they were behind ivy.</t482> <t483>There was no gray in his hair, nor in his long and tangled sideburns.</t483> <t484>As far as could be seen from his hair, its color had faded; his face was ghostly white; but not white like others, a stomach-turning white, a hair-raising white – the white of a tree frog, the white of a fish belly.</t484> <t485>His clothes were– truly rags.</t485> <t486>He had one ankle resting on the opposite knee; on that foot, he kept wiggling the two toes visible through the hole in the tip of his boot.</t486> <t487>He had placed his hat on the ground; the wide-brimmed, shabby black hat had its crown caved in, looking like a pot lid.</t487>
<t488>I stood there motionless, staring; he was sitting in the chair, slouching a bit, scrutinizing me.</t488> <t489>I placed the candle somewhere.</t489> <t490>I noticed that the window was open, so he must have climbed up from the veranda.</t490> <t491>He continued to scrutinize me from head to toe.</t491> <t492>Then he spoke:</t492>
<t493>"Starched clothes, huh... wow."</t493> <t494>"Are you going to act all high and mighty now, is that it?"</t494><t495>"</t495>
<t496>“Whether I become one or not,” I said.</t496>
<t497>“Don't you dare talk back to me,” he said.</t497> <t498>“You've gotten quite full of yourself in my absence.</t498> <t499>But I know how to deflate your ego.</t499> <t500>They say you're going to school, that you can read and write.</t500> <t501>Just because your father is illiterate, you think you're better than him now, huh?</t501> <t502>But I'll set you straight, don't you worry.</t502> <t503>Who told you to waste your time with such trivial nonsense, huh?..</t503> <t504>Who told you, I said?</t504><t505>”</t505>
<t506>“Stop, woman.</t506> <t507>He said.</t507><t508>”</t508>
<t509>“Calling her a widow, huh?..</t509> <t510>Who told the widow to stick her nose into matters that don't concern her?</t510><t511>”</t511>
<t512>“Nobody said anything to him.</t512><t513>”</t513>
<t514>“I'll show him what it means to meddle in everything.</t514> <t515>Now listen to me…</t515> <t516>No ifs, ands, or buts, you're leaving that school.</t516> <t517>I'll show them what it means to raise sons who don't respect their fathers and to allow them to act as if they're superior to their fathers.</t517> <t518>If I catch you near that school again, did you hear me?</t518> <t519>Your mother couldn't read or write either.</t519> <t520>No one in the family could read a single line until they died.</t520> <t521>I can't read either, but now you're standing in front of me acting all high and mighty.</t521> <t522>I have no patience for such things, just so you know.</t522> <t523>Well, go ahead and read, let's see.</t523><t524>”</t524>
<t525>I picked up a book and started reading something about General Washington and the wars.</t525> <t526>I had barely read for half a minute when he struck the book with the back of his hand, sending it flying to the other side of the room.</t526>
<t527>“So that's how it is.</t527> <t528>You are studying.</t528> <t529>At first, I didn't believe it.</t529> <t530>Listen here, kid, you will stop this arrogance.</t530> <t531>Don't test my patience.</t531> <t532>I'll knock you out cold, you smarty-pants; if I see you around that school again, I'll beat you to a pulp.</t532> <t533>Once you start studying, you'll probably turn religious too.</t533> <t534>Such a child is better off not existing.</t534><t535>”</t535>
<t536>He saw a small blue and yellow picture showing cows and a child.</t536>
<t537>“What is this?”</t537><t538>”</t538>
<t539>"It's something they gave me because I learned my lesson well."</t539><t540></t540>
<t541>He tore it up as soon as he received it.</t541>
<t542>“I will give you something better…</t542> <t543>a good beating.</t543><t544>”</t544>
<t545>After sitting for a while, mumbling and grumbling to himself, he spoke again:</t545>
<t546>“So, you became like those well-scented ladies?</t546> <t547>Beds, pajamas; mirrors; carpets on the floor and all...</t547> <t548>but your own father sleeps with pigs in the tannery.</t548> <t549>Such a child is not worth having.</t549> <t550>I swear I will shatter your arrogance so thoroughly.</t550> <t551>What's with this attitude... they say you're rich.</t551> <t552>Huh?..</t552> <t553>How is that possible?</t553><t554>”</t554>
<t555>“Liars… they are lying.</t555><t556>”</t556>
<t557>“Look at me… speak to me properly.</t557> <t558>I'm already at the end of my patience, I don't want any nonsense.</t558> <t559>I've been in town for two days and everyone is talking about your wealth.</t559> <t560>I heard the story all the way down by the river.</t560> <t561>That's why I came.</t561> <t562>Tomorrow, you will give me that money…</t562> <t563>All of it.</t563><t564>”</t564>
<t565>"I have no money."</t565><t566></t566>
<t567>“Liar.</t567> <t568>It's with Judge Thatcher.</t568> <t569>You will go and get it.</t569> <t570>You will give it all to me.</t570><t571>”</t571>
<t572>“I told you, I have no money at all.</t572> <t573>Go ask Judge Thatcher; he’ll tell you the same.</t573><t574>”</t574>
<t575>“Alright then, I'll go and ask.</t575> <t576>Then I'll tell them to take it all apart, and if they can't, I'll understand why.</t576> <t577>How much money do you have in your pocket now?</t577> <t578>Give it all to me.</t578><t579>”</t579>
<t580>“But I only have one dollar; I was going to do something with it…”</t580><t581>”</t581>
<t582>“What you will do is none of my business... go ahead, spill it.</t582><t583>”</t583>
<t584>He took the dollar and bit the edge to see if it was real.</t584> <t585>Then he said he would go to town to buy some whiskey, as he hadn't had a drop all day.</t585> <t586>After stepping out onto the veranda from the window, he poked his head back inside and blamed me for my airs and graces and for trying to be superior to him.</t586> <t587>Just when I thought he had left, his head appeared in the window again, and he warned me to drop out of school, or else he would corner me and beat me until the cows came home.</t587>
<t588>The next day, with a drunken mind, he went to Judge Thatcher's door and tried to scare him into giving the money, and when that didn't work, he swore he would sue him.</t588>
<t589>The judge and the widow lady applied to the court to rescue me from him and to appoint one of them as my legal guardian; but at that time a new judge had been appointed and he did not know my father: Therefore, he said that it was not right for the courts to intervene and separate families unless absolutely necessary.</t589> <t590>He did not want to deprive a child of his father.</t590> <t591>Judge Thatcher and the widow lady had to reluctantly give up on this matter.</t591>
<t592>Our old man couldn't stay still from excitement.</t592> <t593>He said that if I didn't give him money, he would beat me until I was bruised all over.</t593> <t594>I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher.</t594> <t595>My father took the money and immediately started drinking heavily, then began wandering around town, shouting and cursing.</t595> <t596>He grabbed a pan and clanged it around almost until midnight.</t596> <t597>They locked him up; the next day he went to court and got a week's sentence.</t597> <t598>But he was very pleased with himself; he was saying that he could now control his son and that he would make his life miserable from now on.</t598>
<t599>After getting out of prison, the new judge said he would straighten him out.</t599> <t600>He took my father into his own home, dressed him up in fine clothes, and, as the saying goes, treated him like an old friend, giving him breakfast, lunch, and dinner at his family's table.</t600> <t601>After dinner, he gave such a speech to make him quit drinking that our old man burst into tears, saying he had been foolish until then and had wasted his life; now he would turn over a new leaf and become a man no one would be ashamed of, and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him.</t601> <t602>When the judge heard these words, he almost wanted to embrace him.</t602> <t603>He too started crying, and his wife also burst into tears.</t603> <t604>My father said he had always been misunderstood until that day, and the judge said he believed him.</t604> <t605>Our old man said all he wanted was to be shown empathy; the judge agreed with him, and they started crying again.</t605> <t606>When it was time to go to bed, our old man stood up, extended his hand to them, and said:</t606>
<t607>“Take a good look at this hand, gentlemen and ladies.</t607> <t608>Hold this hand.</t608> <t609>Squeeze this hand.</t609> <t610>The owner of this hand used to be a swine, but not anymore; now it's the hand of a man starting a new life, the hand of someone who would rather die than go back.</t610> <t611>Listen carefully to my words…</t611> <t612>always remember that I said these things.</t612> <t613>This is now a clean hand; squeeze this hand… don't be afraid.</t613><t614>”</t614>
<t615>Thus, crying, he shook hands with each one of them.</t615> <t616>The judge's wife even took his hand and kissed it.</t616> <t617>Then our old man had a contract written up and signed it.</t617> <t618>The judge said something about it being the most sacred moment up to that day.</t618> <t619>They placed our father in a very nice room where no one else stayed.</t619> <t620>After everyone went to bed, he couldn't stand the thirst, climbed out the window onto the veranda roof, slid down a support beam, and sold his jacket for a bottle of the hardest liquor.</t620> <t621>Then he climbed back into the room and had a grand old time.</t621> <t622>In the early morning, unable to see an inch in front of him, he climbed out the window again, rolled off the veranda roof, fell, and broke his left arm in two places.</t622> <t623>When someone found him after the sun had risen, he was on the verge of freezing to death.</t623> <t624>When they went up to the room where he had been sleeping, they struggled to make sense of the damage he had caused.</t624>
<t625>The judge was furious.</t625> <t626>He said that our old man could only be reformed at gunpoint, that no other way was possible.</t626>
<t627>Chapter Six</t627>
<t628>Before long, our father recovered and started wandering around.</t628> <t629>He filed a lawsuit against Judge Thatcher to get the money, and because I didn't stop going to school, he started chasing after me.</t629> <t630>He caught me a few times and beat me terribly, but I continued going to school and mostly either stayed out of his sight or lost him by running faster.</t630> <t631>Actually, I didn't really want to go to school before, but I guess I started going just to spite my father.</t631> <t632>The court was progressing quite slowly, and as far as I could tell, it hadn't even started yet.</t632> <t633>So, to avoid getting beaten by my father, I occasionally borrowed two or three dollars from the judge for him.</t633> <t634>As soon as he got his hands on some money, he would drink like a fish, and every time he drank, he would cause a commotion in the town.</t634> <t635>Naturally, they would throw him in jail every time.</t635> <t636>He was living a life that suited him perfectly; this behavior was just his style.</t636>
<t637>He started hanging around the widow a lot.</t637> <t638>Finally, the widow told him that if he showed up again, he would be in big trouble.</t638> <t639>Upon hearing this, he went completely mad.</t639> <t640>He said he would show him who Huck Finn's boss was.</t640> <t641>One day in spring, he set a trap by the creek and caught me, put me in a boat, and took me about three miles up the river.</t641> <t642>From there, he took me across to the Illinois side of the river.</t642> <t643>This side was forested and had nothing but an old wooden cabin.</t643> <t644>The trees were so dense that it was impossible to find the cabin without knowing its exact location.</t644>
<t645>Since he never let me out of his sight, I never had a chance to escape even once.</t645> <t646>We were living in that old cabin, and at night he always locked the door and put the key under his pillow.</t646> <t647>Somehow, he had managed to steal a rifle.</t647> <t648>We were getting by through hunting and fishing there.</t648> <t649>From time to time, he would lock me inside, jump into the boat, and go to a store three miles down to trade the fish he caught or the animals he hunted for whiskey.</t649> <t650>When he came back home, he would drink and get drunk, then beat me.</t650> <t651>The widow eventually found out where I was and sent a man to bring me back, but my father chased him away with a gun.</t651> <t652>Before long, I got used to the place and even started to like life there, except for the frequent beatings.</t652>
<t653>Spending the whole day smoking tobacco and fishing, lying around without studying at all, both made a person lazy and brought them joy.</t653> <t654>After about two months, all the clothes I had on turned into filthy rags.</t654> <t655>I no longer knew why I loved the widow's house so much, where I constantly washed, ate from a plate, combed my hair, went to bed and got up on time, constantly dealt with books, and was always scolded by our Miss Watson.</t655> <t656>I didn't want to go back.</t656> <t657>I had stopped swearing because the widow didn't like it, but I had started again since my father didn't object.</t657> <t658>To be honest, I was having quite a good time in the forest.</t658>
<t659>But after a while, my father increased the beatings so much that I couldn't bear it anymore.</t659> <t660>Every part of my body was covered in bruises and wounds.</t660> <t661>Moreover, he frequently left, locking me inside.</t661> <t662>Once, he locked the door and didn't come back for three days.</t662> <t663>I felt terribly lonely.</t663> <t664>I thought he had drowned somewhere and that I would never be able to get out.</t664> <t665>I was very scared.</t665> <t666>I decided to find a way to escape from there.</t666> <t667>Previously, I had tried very hard to get out of the cabin but couldn't find a way.</t667> <t668>The windows were so small that even a dog couldn't fit through.</t668> <t669>I tried the chimney, but it was too narrow as well.</t669> <t670>The door was made of thick oak planks.</t670> <t671>My father was careful not to leave any knives or such in the house when he was outside.</t671> <t672>I searched every corner of the cabin maybe a hundred times.</t672> <t673>In fact, I had no other job than to explore the surroundings, because it was the only way to pass the time.</t673> <t674>But this time, I finally managed to find something.</t674> <t675>It was a rusty, handleless saw wedged between the roof beam and the ceiling planks.</t675> <t676>I oiled the saw and started working.</t676> <t677>There was an old horse blanket nailed to the wood behind the table at the back of the cabin to prevent the wind from blowing out the candle through the cracks in the wall.</t677> <t678>I crawled under the table, lifted the edge of the blanket, and started working to cut the lowest log to create a hole big enough for me to pass through.</t678> <t679>This took quite a long time, but I was about to finish when I heard my father's gunshot in the forest.</t679> <t680>I immediately cleaned up the sawdust around, hung the blanket back in place, and hid my saw.</t680> <t681>Soon after, my father appeared at the door.</t681>
<t682>His mood wasn't very good – in other words, it was as usual.</t682> <t683>He said he went down to the town and everything was going badly.</t683> <t684>His lawyer told him that if the trials could start, he would win the case and get the money, but there were ways to delay it and Judge Thatcher knew all of them very well.</t684> <t685>Also, another case had been filed to take me from my father and appoint the widow as my legal guardian to place me in her care, and it seemed like they were going to win this time.</t685> <t686>I felt uneasy when I heard this because I no longer wanted to go to the widow's house, be restricted, and "become a man."</t686> <t687>Our old man started cursing, he cursed everything and everyone that came to his mind, then to make sure he didn't miss anyone, he cursed them all again, and finally, he gave a thorough cursing to everything in general as a final touch.</t687> <t688>When it came to some of the last things he cursed, he didn't even know their names, so he would say "whatever its name is" and then continue.</t688>
<t689>If that man tries to take me, he said he would make him regret it.</t689> <t690>He would constantly watch them, and if they tried to play tricks on him, he knew another place six or seven miles away to hide me.</t690> <t691>Even if they searched there until they died of exhaustion, they wouldn't be able to find me.</t691> <t692>When I heard this, I got worried again, but only for a minute; right after, I made my decision, I certainly wasn't going to sit and wait for him to do it.</t692>
<t693>My father sent me to the boat to carry the materials he brought.</t693> <t694>On the boat, there was a twenty-five-kilogram sack of corn, pork bacon, ammunition, a sixteen-liter barrel of whiskey, an old book to make tinder, two newspapers, and some rope.</t694> <t695>I carried some of it and took it away, then went back and lay down at the front of the boat to rest.</t695> <t696>Before leaving the cabin, I would take the rifle and the fishing gear and escape through the forest.</t696> <t697>I wouldn't stay in one place, but would wander from place to place.</t697> <t698>I would generally travel at night, hunt and fish to survive, and get so far away that neither my father nor the widow would ever find me.</t698> <t699>If my father drank enough and passed out, which he most likely would, I thought I could cut the rest of the plank and get out at night.</t699> <t700>I was so lost in these thoughts that I forgot how time passed.</t700> <t701>Finally, I heard him calling and asking if I had fallen asleep or drowned.</t701>
<t702>By the time I had carried everything inside, it was almost dark.</t702> <t703>While I was cooking dinner, our old man had a few drinks and then started cursing again.</t703> <t704>He had gotten drunk in town and ended up lying in a ditch, quite a sight to see indeed.</t704> <t705>He was so covered in mud that one could have mistaken him for Adam himself.</t705> <t706>Whenever he got drunk, he would always curse the government.</t706> <t707>He started again:</t707>
<t708>“Such a government should not exist!</t708> <t709>Just standing still and looking is enough to see what it is.</t709> <t710>This so-called law is ready to take a man's son away from him – his own son, whom he has endured countless troubles and hardships to raise.</t710> <t711>When the poor man finally thinks he has raised his child, and expects to find a job and take care of him, and perhaps find some peace for himself, the laws suddenly stand against him.</t711> <t712>Is this what a government should be like!</t712> <t713>No, it shouldn't be like this.</t713> <t714>The law supports our Judge Thatcher and helps him take my property away from me.</t714> <t715>This is what the laws are good for.</t715> <t716>Their so-called law strips a man worth six thousand dollars to the bone and stuffs him into such old shacks, making him wear clothes that even pigs wouldn't wear.</t716> <t717>Is this a government!</t717> <t718>Who can seek their rights in this government?</t718> <t719>Sometimes I think of leaving this country and never coming back.</t719> <t720>I told them this too.</t720> <t721>I even told it to our Thatcher's face.</t721> <t722>Several men heard me, they all witnessed it.</t722> <t723>I said I would even pay money to leave this country and never come back.</t723> <t724>That's exactly what I said.</t724> <t725>Look at this hat of mine, I said…</t725> <t726>can this even be called a hat… its top opens up and it comes down to my chin.</t726> <t727>It's no longer a hat, it's as if my head is stuck in a stove pipe.</t727> <t728>Look here, I said, this is the kind of hat you make me wear, one of the richest men in town.</t728> <t729>Oh, if only I could get my rights.</t729>
<t730>Yeah, what a fine government, what a fine one.</t730> <t731>Listen to me carefully.</t731> <t732>There is a free black man from Ohio there, but he is a mulatto, almost as white as the whites.</t732> <t733>He walks around in the whitest shirt you can see; he wears the finest hat.</t733> <t734>There is no one in town who dresses as well as he does.</t734> <t735>He has a gold pocket watch and a cane with a silver knob.</t735> <t736>The most pompous, the oldest, the richest dandy in the state.</t736> <t737>And do you know what they say?</t737> <t738>They say he is a professor at a university, speaks every language, and knows everything.</t738> <t739>As if all this were not enough...</t739> <t740>He can even vote in the state he lives in.</t740> <t741>What insolence!</t741> <t742>I said, what will become of this country...</t742> <t743>On election day, I was just about to go to the ballot box, I mean, I would have gone if I hadn't been too drunk to walk, when they told me there is a state in this country where blacks can vote.</t743> <t744>I turned back right there.</t744> <t745>I said I would never vote again.</t745> <t746>I said exactly that, and they all heard it anyway.</t746> <t747>Let the country burn for all I care...</t747>
<t748>I will never vote again in my life.</t748> <t749>You should have seen the airs of that black guy…</t749> <t750>if I hadn't pushed him aside and passed, he wouldn't have even given way.</t750> <t751>Why don't they put this black guy up for auction and sell him…</t751> <t752>tell me why, I said.</t752> <t753>Do you know what they answered?</t753> <t754>Apparently, he can't be sold until he has been in the state for six months, and it hasn't been six months yet, sir.</t754> <t755>Here's another example for you.</t755> <t756>They call a government that can't sell a free black guy before he's been in the state for six months a government.</t756>
<t757>He himself calls it my government, continues his work, and thinks he is the government; the vagabond, thief, disgusting, waits for six months without lifting a finger to catch and sell a free black man in a white shirt...</t757><t758>”</t758>
<t759>My father kept talking non-stop, not paying attention to where his trembling legs were taking him.</t759> <t760>He tripped over the hog-salting tub and fell headfirst, hitting both of his shins somewhere, and his subsequent speech turned into a dreadful curse – mostly hurling insults at that black man and the government, but the tub also got its share of the swearing.</t760> <t761>Inside the cabin, he hopped first on one foot, then on the other, and then he kicked the tub.</t761> <t762>But he made a mistake, because the toe of the boot on that foot was torn, and two of his toes were sticking out.</t762> <t763>He started howling so much that it made my hair stand on end.</t763> <t764>Then he began rolling around in the dust, clutching his aching toes in pain.</t764> <t765>Meanwhile, he was cursing even more vehemently than before.</t765> <t766>When he finished, he didn't forget to mention that he had outdone himself this time.</t766> <t767>He had listened to Sowberry Hagan in his golden age, but now he was leaving even him in the dust, though it seemed to me he was exaggerating a bit.</t767>
<t768>After dinner, my father looked at the barrel and said he had enough whiskey to get drunk twice and to completely pass out once.</t768> <t769>He always said that.</t769> <t770>I had calculated that he would be dead drunk within about an hour, and after that, I would either steal the key or cut the planks.</t770> <t771>He drank and drank, and finally collapsed on the blankets, but my luck had not favored me.</t771> <t772>Instead of falling into a deep sleep, he kept tossing and turning.</t772> <t773>For a long time, he continued to make snoring and groaning sounds, turning from side to side.</t773> <t774>Eventually, I got so sleepy that I couldn't keep my eyelids open.</t774> <t775>At some point, I must have completely fallen asleep, and it didn't even occur to me to extinguish the candle.</t775>
<t776>I don't know how long I slept, but suddenly a terrifying scream woke me up.</t776> <t777>My father was running around like crazy, shouting, "There's a snake!</t777> <t778>Snake!"</t778> <t779>He said one was climbing up his leg, then he let out another scream and jumped into the air, saying one had bitten his cheek – but I couldn't see any snake around.</t779> <t780>He was running around the cabin shouting, "Get it off me, get it off me, now it bit my neck!"</t780> <t781>I'd never seen a man's eyes open so wide.</t781> <t782>Soon he became exhausted and collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath.</t782> <t783>Then he started rolling on the ground, kicking in all directions, slapping and punching at something in the air.</t783> <t784>He was shouting that demons had taken over him.</t784> <t785>But then he got really tired and lay still, moaning for a while.</t785> <t786>Finally, he became completely motionless, his voice fell silent.</t786> <t787>I could hear owls hooting and wolves howling in the distant parts of the forest, and a terrifying silence filled the cabin.</t787> <t788>My father had collapsed in a corner.</t788> <t789>After a while, he got up and started listening intently.</t789> <t790>He began to speak in a low voice:</t790>
<t791>“Rap… rap… rap; the dead are rising; rap… rap…</t791> <t792>rap; it's coming from behind me; but I won't go…</t792> <t793>Aah, here they come!</t793> <t794>Don't touch…</t794> <t795>Move away! Take your hands off…</t795> <t796>Your hands are so cold; leave me…</t796> <t797>Aah, don't bother this poor soul!</t797><t798>”</t798>
<t799>He crawled forward, begging them on his knees to leave.</t799> <t800>Wrapping himself in his blanket, he continued to beg as he crawled under the old pine table and started to cry there.</t800> <t801>I could hear him sobbing under the blanket.</t801>
<t802>After a while, he came out from under the table, sprang to his feet in a frenzy, saw me, and immediately walked towards me.</t802> <t803>He was chasing me with a switchblade in his hand; while I was running around the cabin, he was shouting that I was the Angel of Death, that he would kill me, and thus I would never come to take him again.</t803> <t804>I begged him, told him that I was just poor Huck; but he let out a terrible, shrill laugh, continued to chase me, roaring and cursing.</t804> <t805>Once, when I suddenly turned and tried to slip under his arm, he grabbed me by the collar of my jacket.</t805> <t806>I thought I was done for, but then I slipped out of the jacket like lightning and saved myself.</t806> <t807>Soon after, he became exhausted again, leaned against the door to catch his breath, and said that after resting there for a while, he would kill me.</t807> <t808>Then he leaned back completely, hid the knife underneath him, and said he would take a nap to regain his strength, and then show me who was who.</t808>
<t809>He soon fell completely asleep.</t809> <t810>I quietly and slowly pulled the old chair with the broken seat as best as I could, climbed on it, and took the rifle down from the wall.</t810> <t811>I checked if it was loaded with the ramrod, and upon realizing it was, I pointed the barrel at my father, placed it on the turnip barrel, and sat behind the barrel, waiting for him to move.</t811> <t812>Time was passing so slowly, and it was so quiet around.</t812>
<t813>Chapter Seven</t813>
<t814>"Get up!</t814> <t815>What are you doing here?</t815><t816>"</t816>
<t817>I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to understand where I was.</t817> <t818>The sun had risen high, and I had fallen asleep.</t818> <t819>My father was standing over me, looking irritable and quite pale.</t819> <t820>He continued:</t820>
<t821>“What is this rifle doing here?</t821><t822>”</t822>
<t823>I realized that he didn't remember what he did at night, so I said:</t823>
<t824>“Someone tried to get in, so I took it down.</t824><t825>”</t825>
<t826>“Why didn't you wake me up?</t826><t827>”</t827>
<t828>“I tried to lift you, but it didn't work, you didn't even budge.</t828><t829>”</t829>
<t830>“Alright, fine.</t830> <t831>You’re not going to chatter here all day, I suppose.</t831> <t832>Go outside and check if there are any breakfast fish on the lines.</t832> <t833>I’ll come in a bit.</t833><t834>”</t834>
<t835>He opened the door and immediately dashed outside, walking upstream along the river.</t835> <t836>Tree branches were floating in the water, and there were also pieces of tree bark.</t836> <t837>I realized that the river was starting to rise.</t837> <t838>If I were in town, this would be very beneficial for me.</t838> <t839>The June floods always brought me good fortune, because as soon as the river started to rise, bundles of firewood and pieces of raft timber would float downstream – sometimes I would come across a dozen pieces of wood at once.</t839> <t840>I would catch them and sell them to the woodcutter or directly to the lumber mill.</t840>
<t841>While looking to see if my father was coming and also investigating what the flood was bringing, I walked up the shore.</t841> <t842>Before long, I saw a canoe.</t842> <t843>It was very beautiful, about four meters long, and gliding like a duck.</t843> <t844>Without even taking off my clothes, I immediately dived headfirst into the water like a frog and swam towards the canoe.</t844> <t845>I thought someone was lying in it waiting, because people often do this as a joke.</t845> <t846>When someone gets close enough with a boat, they suddenly sit up and laugh at their reaction.</t846> <t847>But this time, it wasn't like that.</t847> <t848>It was clear that it was an abandoned canoe.</t848> <t849>I got into the canoe and brought it to the shore.</t849> <t850>I thought our old man would be happy to see the canoe – it was worth almost ten dollars.</t850> <t851>But when I reached the shore, my father was still nowhere to be seen.</t851> <t852>As I was pulling the canoe into a small creek mouth covered with ivy and willows, another idea came to my mind.</t852> <t853>I would hide the canoe well, and instead of escaping through the forest, I would go down the river about fifty miles and set up camp somewhere.</t853> <t854>That way, my feet wouldn't get sore from walking.</t854>
<t855>Since I was quite close to our cabin, I was constantly scared that our old man would come any moment.</t855> <t856>But still, I hid the canoe, and then looked towards the cabin through the willows.</t856> <t857>My father was aiming at a bird at the end of the road.</t857> <t858>So, he hadn't noticed the canoe.</t858>
<t859>When my father came to me, I was diligently working to reel in a fishing line.</t859> <t860>He complained that I was too slow, but I told him it took so long because I had fallen into the river.</t860> <t861>Because I knew he would notice that I was wet and start asking questions.</t861> <t862>We gathered five catfish from the lines and returned home.</t862>
<t863>After breakfast, a heaviness settled over both of us, and we began to doze off somewhere.</t863> <t864>Meanwhile, I was looking for a solution so that my father or the widow wouldn't come after me once I escaped.</t864> <t865>I needed to find a more certain way than just hoping to get far enough away before they noticed my absence.</t865> <t866>You never know what might happen to you.</t866> <t867>For a while, no solution came to mind, but then when my father got up to fetch some water from the barrel, he said:</t867>
<t868>“If someone comes near the house again, you will wake me up, do you understand?</t868> <t869>I don't think that man came with good intentions.</t869> <t870>I'll shoot him.</t870> <t871>Next time, you will wake me up, did you hear?</t871><t872>”</t872>
<t873>Then he lay down again and started to sleep – but his words had just helped me find the idea I was looking for.</t873> <t874>Now I think I've found a way to ensure no one follows me, I said to myself.</t874>
<t875>We got up around noon and went back to the shore.</t875> <t876>The river had started to flow faster, and because of the flood, a lot of tree branches and wood were being carried along.</t876> <t877>A little later, a piece of a raft came – there were nine logs tied together.</t877> <t878>We immediately took the boat and pulled the raft to the shore.</t878> <t879>Then we ate.</t879> <t880>Anyone else would have waited all day and tried to catch more things, but that wasn't my father's style.</t880> <t881>Nine logs were enough for one trip.</t881> <t882>All he had to do was take the logs to town and sell them.</t882> <t883>He locked me inside, got on the boat, and set off around three-thirty, towing the raft along.</t883> <t884>I knew he wouldn't come back that night.</t884> <t885>I waited until I was sure he was far enough away, then took out the saw and continued cutting the plank.</t885> <t886>Before my father even reached the other side of the river, I had climbed out through the hole.</t886> <t887>The boat and the raft were just two small dots far away.</t887>
<t888>I took the sack of corn and brought it to the place where I had hidden the canoe, parted the vines and branches, and placed the sack in the canoe, then I brought the bacon.</t888> <t889>After that, I carried the whiskey barrel, took all the coffee and sugar from the house, and also brought the ammunition.</t889> <t890>I took the tinder.</t890> <t891>I took the bucket and the water container.</t891> <t892>I also took the ladle, the tin cup, the old saw, two blankets, the pan, and the coffee pot.</t892> <t893>I took the fishing line, the matches, and other things; everything that was worth money.</t893> <t894>I had swept everything clean.</t894> <t895>I also needed an axe, but there wasn't one inside, only by the woodpile, and I knew why I had to leave it there.</t895> <t896>Finally, I took the rifle; I had completed the task.</t896>
<t897>By going in and out of the shed and carrying a lot of things, I had made quite a few tracks on the ground.</t897> <t898>So, I carefully erased my tracks from the outside and cleaned up the sawdust.</t898> <t899>Then I placed the piece of plank firmly in its place, putting two stones underneath and one in front to keep it steady – because it didn't fit perfectly and didn't touch the ground.</t899> <t900>But I had placed it so well that someone standing a meter or two away, who didn't know it had been cut, wouldn't even notice it, plus this was at the back of the cabin where hardly anyone would come.</t900>
<t901>The road up to Kanoya was covered with grass, so I hadn't left any tracks there.</t901> <t902>To be sure, I went back and forth once to check.</t902> <t903>Then I went to the shore and watched the river.</t903> <t904>Everything was fine.</t904> <t905>I took the rifle and went into the forest, looking for a bird to hunt.</t905> <t906>Instead, I encountered a wild boar.</t906> <t907>Pigs that escaped from large farms would become feral after staying in the forest for a while.</t907> <t908>I shot the boar and took it to the hut.</t908>
<t909>I took the axe and broke the door – I had hit it with all my strength and shattered the planks.</t909> <t910>I took the pig inside and brought it to a spot near the table, then cut its throat with the axe.</t910> <t911>I left it on the ground so the blood could drain – I say ground because there was no flooring, no planks laid, just the compacted earth beneath.</t911> <t912>Then I took an old sack and filled it with large stones – just enough that I could still drag it.</t912> <t913>I dragged the sack from where the pig was, through the door, down to the riverbank among the trees, and left it in the water there.</t913> <t914>It immediately sank and disappeared from sight.</t914> <t915>It was clear that something had been dragged on the ground.</t915> <t916>I wish Tom Sawyer had been with me...</t916>
<t917>I knew very well how keen you were on such schemes, if he saw it now, who knows what cunning ideas would come to his mind.</t917> <t918>I've never seen anyone in my life whose mind worked as sharply as Tom Sawyer's in such matters.</t918>
<t919>Then I pulled out a few strands of my hair, covered the axe thoroughly with blood, stuck the hair onto it, and threw the axe into a corner.</t919> <t920>Then I took the pig, wrapped it in my jacket (so the blood wouldn't drip on the ground), and pressed it against my chest.</t920> <t921>Finally, after walking downstream and getting quite far from the house, I threw the blood-stained jacket and the pig into the river.</t921> <t922>Then another idea came to mind.</t922> <t923>I took the sack of flour and the old saw from the canoe and brought them back to the house.</t923> <t924>After placing the sack in its usual spot, I made a hole in the bottom with the saw – since my father handled everything with his switchblade, there were no knives or forks in the house for cooking.</t924> <t925>I carried the sack about a hundred meters through the willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five miles wide and covered with reeds – there were also many ducks in season.</t925> <t926>On the other side of the lake, there was a pond or stream that went on for miles.</t926> <t927>I didn't know exactly where it went, but it definitely didn't flow into the river.</t927> <t928>The flour spilling from the sack left a thin trail all the way to the lake.</t928> <t929>On the shore, I also threw down my father's whetstone; it would look like it had fallen accidentally.</t929> <t930>Then I tied the bottom of the flour sack tightly with a rope, and once I was sure it wasn't spilling anymore, I took it back to the canoe along with the saw.</t930>
<t931>It was about to get dark.</t931> <t932>I lowered the canoe a bit further down and went under the willows hanging over the water, and began to wait for the moon to rise.</t932> <t933>I tied the canoe to a willow trunk.</t933> <t934>Then I ate something and soon lay inside the canoe, smoking my pipe and starting to think about my plan.</t934> <t935>They would follow the stone sack to the shore and then search the river for my body.</t935> <t936>Additionally, they would follow the flour trail to the lake, and from there, they would search along the creek to find the robbers who killed me and took my belongings.</t936> <t937>They would find a lot of things in the river besides my dead body.</t937> <t938>Eventually, they would get tired and give up searching.</t938> <t939>It was all set, I could go wherever I wanted.</t939> <t940>Jackson Island was just right for me.</t940> <t941>I knew the island well and no one ever went there.</t941> <t942>At night, I could row down to the town and sneak around to take whatever I needed.</t942> <t943>Jackson Island was perfectly fine.</t943>
<t944>As I was quite tired, I fell asleep while thinking about these things.</t944> <t945>When I woke up, I couldn't remember where I was for a moment.</t945> <t946>I sat up and looked around with some anxiety.</t946> <t947>Then I remembered everything.</t947> <t948>The river seemed to be miles wide.</t948> <t949>The moon was so bright that I could distinguish the dark logs passing by from hundreds of meters away.</t949> <t950>A deathly silence had settled over everything, and it was evidently late; it even smelled late.</t950> <t951>You know what I mean – I just can't choose the right words every time.</t951>
<t952>I stretched and yawned widely, and just as I was about to untie the rope and set off, I heard a sound coming from afar over the water.</t952> <t953>I immediately perked up my ears.</t953> <t954>Soon, I understood what it was.</t954> <t955>It was the regular sound of oars rubbing against the rowlocks on silent nights.</t955> <t956>When I looked through the willow branches, I saw it – there was a boat in the distance.</t956> <t957>I couldn't see how many people were inside.</t957> <t958>It was coming towards me, and when it got closer, I saw that there was only one person inside.</t958> <t959>I wasn't expecting anyone that night, but maybe it was my father.</t959> <t960>As the boat passed by me, it rippled the water, and soon after the water calmed, it continued rowing towards the shore.</t960> <t961>It had passed so close to me that I could have touched it with my rifle if I had extended it.</t961> <t962>This was definitely my father – and judging by his rowing, he was completely sober.</t962>
<t963>I didn't waste any time.</t963> <t964>A little later, I was moving silently but swiftly in the direction of the current from within the shadows on the shore.</t964> <t965>After going about two and a half miles, I moved to the middle of the river for about a quarter mile, because I would soon be passing the steamboat dock and people might see and call out to me.</t965> <t966>I dove among the drifting logs, then lay down inside the canoe, letting go of the oars.</t966> <t967>I rested there nicely, watching the cloudless sky and puffing on my pipe.</t967> <t968>When lying on my back in the moonlight, the sky seemed so deep; I had never noticed this before.</t968> <t969>Also, how far sounds traveled over water on such nights!</t969> <t970>Men were talking at the steamboat dock.</t970> <t971>I could hear every word they said.</t971> <t972>One of the men said that the days were getting longer and the nights shorter.</t972> <t973>The other said that this night was not one of the short ones – then they laughed heartily.</t973> <t974>He said the same thing again and they laughed once more.</t974> <t975>Then they woke up another man, told him, and laughed; but the man did not laugh.</t975> <t976>After scolding them, he told them to give him a little peace.</t976> <t977>The first man mentioned that he would tell this to his wife – she would find it very funny too.</t977> <t978>But compared to the jokes he used to make, this one was nothing.</t978> <t979>Another man said it was three o'clock and hoped that the day wouldn't take more than a week to dawn.</t979> <t980>Then the conversations gradually faded away, I could no longer make out the words, but I could still hear their murmurs.</t980> <t981>From time to time, they laughed, but their voices came from very far away.</t981>
<t982>I had already passed the ferry dock.</t982> <t983>When I looked up, I saw Jackson Island two and a half miles down.</t983> <t984>It looked huge, dark, and solid with its dense trees rising from the middle of the river.</t984> <t985>It resembled a steamboat with its lights turned off.</t985> <t986>The sandy beach at the front had disappeared from sight – it was now completely underwater.</t986>
<t987>It didn't take long for me to get there.</t987> <t988>I passed the front of the island like lightning; the current was very strong.</t988> <t989>Then I entered calm water and landed on the Illinois side.</t989> <t990>I pulled the canoe into a nook I knew on the shore.</t990> <t991>I had to part the willow branches to get inside.</t991> <t992>After tying it tightly, no one would be able to see it from the outside.</t992>
<t993>I went and sat on a log at the head of the island and started watching the big river, the drifting black logs, and the town three miles away where three or four lights were flickering.</t993> <t994>A massive lumber raft was coming from about a mile upstream.</t994> <t995>There was a lantern right in the middle of it.</t995> <t996>I watched as the raft slowly approached.</t996> <t997>When it reached right opposite me, I heard a man shout, “Oars at the stern!</t997> <t998>Turn the bow to starboard!”</t998> <t999>I heard his voice as clearly as if he were right next to me.</t999>
<t1000>The color of the sky had started to lighten slightly.</t1000> <t1001>I went into the trees to take a nap before breakfast.</t1001>
<t1002>Chapter Eight</t1002>
<t1003>When I woke up, the sun had risen so high that I thought it was past eight o'clock.</t1003> <t1004>I lay down again on the grass in the cool shade and started to think.</t1004> <t1005>I felt rested and quite relaxed, I was content with my life.</t1005> <t1006>I could see the sun through a few small holes, but the top was mostly covered by large tree branches, and the part underneath was a bit dim.</t1006> <t1007>In a few places where the light seeped through the branches, bright spots had formed, and from the slow movement of these spots, it was clear that there was a light breeze above.</t1007> <t1008>Two squirrels sat on a branch and chirped something to me in a very friendly manner.</t1008>
<t1009>A great sense of ease and laziness had settled over me; I didn't even feel like getting up to prepare breakfast.</t1009> <t1010>Just as I was about to fall back asleep, I heard a deep "boom" sound far off, upstream of the river.</t1010> <t1011>I immediately propped myself up on my elbow and listened intently.</t1011> <t1012>Soon, there was another boom.</t1012> <t1013>I quickly jumped to my feet and went to look around through a gap in the branches and leaves.</t1013> <t1014>High above, a small puff of smoke was rising over the water – it was level with the dock.</t1014> <t1015>There was the steamboat, coming down filled with people.</t1015> <t1016>Now I understood what was going on.</t1016> <t1017>"Boom!" I saw another white cloud of smoke emerge from the side of the steamboat.</t1017> <t1018>They were firing the cannon to make my body rise to the surface of the water.</t1018>
<t1019>I was very hungry, but I was hesitant to light a fire because they could see the smoke.</t1019> <t1020>So I settled down right there and watched the cannon smoke and listened to the "boom" sounds.</t1020> <t1021>The river was a mile wide there and always looked very beautiful on summer mornings – so their attempt to find my remains had turned into quite a spectacle, oh if only there was something to eat.</t1021> <t1022>Then I remembered that they floated loaves of bread with mercury in them on the river.</t1022> <t1023>The loaf would always stop over the drowned body.</t1023> <t1024>I thought, I’ll watch to see if they’ll float a loaf after me, and if they do, I’ll find a way to get it.</t1024> <t1025>I went to the side of the island facing Illinois and tried my luck and wasn’t disappointed.</t1025> <t1026>A huge double loaf came, and with the help of a long stick, I almost caught it, but I slipped and the loaf drifted away.</t1026> <t1027>Of course, I was where the current was closest to the shore; I knew this very well.</t1027> <t1028>But a little later, another loaf came, and this time I won.</t1028> <t1029>I opened the top of the loaf, removed the drop of mercury inside, and then started eating.</t1029> <t1030>It wasn’t one of our terrible corn breads but a "baked" bread – the kind respectable people eat.</t1030>
<t1031>I chose a good spot among the branches, sat on a log there, and enjoyed myself eating the bread and watching the steamboat.</t1031> <t1032>Then suddenly something came to my mind.</t1032> <t1033>The widow, the preacher, or someone else had prayed for this loaf to find me, and indeed it had come and found me.</t1033> <t1034>So there must have been something to this loaf business.</t1034> <t1035>That is, when the widow or the preacher prayed, it worked, but when people like me prayed, nothing happened; apparently, only the right people were heard when they prayed.</t1035>
<t1036>I continued to watch, enjoying myself for a long time while smoking my pipe.</t1036> <t1037>The steamboat was moving downstream with the current, and as it got closer, I would be able to see who was on the deck, because it was certain to come very close to where the bread was going.</t1037> <t1038>When the steamboat turned towards me, I put out my pipe and approached the spot where I had caught the bread, hiding behind a log in a small opening on the shore.</t1038> <t1039>I could watch without showing myself through a knot on the log.</t1039> <t1040>The steamboat came very close and passed so near that it wouldn't have been difficult for them to throw a plank and come ashore.</t1040> <t1041>Almost everyone had gathered on the deck.</t1041> <t1042>My father, Judge Thatcher; Bessie Thatcher, Jo Harper; Tom Sawyer; his old aunt Polly, Sid and Mary, and many other familiar faces.</t1042> <t1043>Everyone was talking about the murder, but the captain silenced them with his loud voice, saying:</t1043>
<t1044>“Now look carefully.</t1044> <t1045>This is the place where the current is closest to the shore.</t1045> <t1046>Maybe it has washed ashore and got caught in the branches of the trees by the water.</t1046> <t1047>I hope we find it.</t1047><t1048>”</t1048>
<t1049>I never expected it that way.</t1049> <t1050>They all suddenly crowded near the railing, almost close enough to look directly into my eyes, and without moving, they began to scan the shore with all their attention.</t1050> <t1051>I could see them all very clearly, but they couldn't see me.</t1051> <t1052>Then I heard the captain's voice:</t1052>
<t1053>“Move aside a bit!” and the cannonball exploded right in front of me with such force that I was deafened by the noise and blinded by the smoke.</t1053> <t1054>For a moment, I thought I was dying.</t1054> <t1055>If there had been a cannonball inside the cannon, they would have finally found the corpse they were looking for.</t1055> <t1056>But thankfully, I wasn't injured.</t1056> <t1057>The steamboat continued on its way and disappeared from sight after passing the tip of the island.</t1057> <t1058>The occasional booms that were still heard gradually faded away, and after about an hour, I could no longer hear them at all.</t1058> <t1059>The island was three miles long.</t1059> <t1060>I thought they had gone to the end of the island and finally given up.</t1060> <t1061>But they still hadn't given up.</t1061> <t1062>After reaching the end of the island, they turned and entered the strait on the Missouri side; as the steamboat moved forward, it occasionally continued to boom, sending out puffs of smoke from its chimney.</t1062> <t1063>I also moved to that side and watched them.</t1063> <t1064>When they reached the level of the head of the island, they stopped firing the cannon, scanned the Missouri shore briefly, and then headed back towards the village.</t1064>
<t1065>I knew I had finally gotten away.</t1065> <t1066>No one else would come looking for me.</t1066> <t1067>I took my belongings out of the canoe and set up a nice camp spot in the dense forest.</t1067> <t1068>I made something like a tent out of my blankets so the rain wouldn't reach my things.</t1068> <t1069>I caught a catfish, cut its belly open with a saw; then lit my campfire at sunset and had my dinner.</t1069> <t1070>Afterwards, I cast a line to catch some fish for breakfast.</t1070>
<t1071>When night fell, I started puffing on my stick by my campfire, I was very content with my situation; but then I gradually began to feel lonely, so I went and sat by the shore, listened to the bubbling flow of the water; I counted the stars, the drifting logs, and the rafts going downstream, then I lay down and slept; there is no better way to pass the time when you are alone; but you won't feel lonely for too long anyway, it passes with time.</t1071>
<t1072>So, three days and three nights passed like this.</t1072> <t1073>There was nothing different; I was doing the same thing all the time.</t1073> <t1074>But the next day, I started to explore the island.</t1074> <t1075>One could say I was the master of the island; it all belonged to me; that's why I wanted to learn every inch of it; although what I really wanted was to find something to keep myself busy.</t1075> <t1076>I found plenty of strawberries, both ripe and delicious, then I found unripe grapes and raspberries, and also the blackberries had started to grow green and fleshy.</t1076> <t1077>In time, they would all become edible.</t1077>
<t1078>I wandered through the dense forest until I reached a place not too far from the edge of the island.</t1078> <t1079>My rifle was always by my side, but I hadn't shot anything; the rifle was for my protection; although if I were near the house, I would hunt something.</t1079> <t1080>Meanwhile, I almost stepped on a rather large snake, which slithered away through the grass and flowers, and I chased after it, thinking I might be able to shoot it.</t1080> <t1081>As I moved quickly, I suddenly found myself standing over the ashes of a campfire that was still smoking.</t1081>
<t1082>I was bewildered.</t1082> <t1083>I didn't linger to scout the surroundings, I cocked the rifle and tiptoed back as quickly as possible.</t1083> <t1084>From time to time, I would stop among the dense branches and listen around, but I was breathing so loudly from excitement that I couldn't hear anything else.</t1084> <t1085>After walking a bit, I stopped again to listen to the surroundings, then again, and again.</t1085> <t1086>If I saw a tree stump, I thought it was a man; if I stepped on a branch and it broke, it felt as if someone had cut my breath in half and left me with the shorter half.</t1086>
<t1087>When I arrived at the camp, I had neither my vitality nor my boldness left; I had somewhat lost my former determination, but now is not the time to dawdle or get lost in thoughts, I told myself.</t1087> <t1088>Therefore, after packing all my belongings back into my canoe and hiding it from sight, extinguishing the fire and scattering the ashes to create the appearance of an old campsite, I climbed up a tree.</t1088>
<t1089>I probably stayed at the top of the tree for about two hours; but I saw nothing, I heard nothing – I only thought I saw or heard thousands of things.</t1089> <t1090>I couldn't stay at the top of the tree forever; so finally, I came down, but I was stuck among the dense trees and constantly watched my surroundings.</t1090> <t1091>There was only a bit of fruit and leftovers from breakfast as food.</t1091>
<t1092>In the evening, I was very hungry.</t1092> <t1093>So, I waited for the darkest moment and rowed away from the shore towards the Illinois coast, a quarter mile away, before the moon rose.</t1093> <t1094>I went into the forest, cooked some food, and had decided to stay there all night when I heard the clattering sounds of horses approaching; soon after, I also heard human voices.</t1094> <t1095>After hurriedly loading everything onto the canoe, I crawled through the forest to see what was happening.</t1095> <t1096>Before I could go any further, I heard a man's voice:</t1096>
<t1097>“If we find a good spot, let's camp here; the horses are very tired.</t1097> <t1098>Let's explore the surroundings.</t1098><t1099>”</t1099>
<t1100>I didn't wait at all, I immediately set off and rowed away comfortably.</t1100> <t1101>I returned to my old spot, tied up the canoe, and decided that the best thing to do was to sleep inside it.</t1101>
<t1102>I couldn't sleep much.</t1102> <t1103>My thoughts were not giving me peace.</t1103> <t1104>Moreover, every time I woke up, I thought someone was grabbing my neck.</t1104> <t1105>Therefore, it can't really be said that I got enough sleep.</t1105> <t1106>I had slowly started to understand that I couldn't live like this anymore; I had to find out who else was on the island besides me; either I would find out or I would burst from curiosity.</t1106> <t1107>This firm decision brought me some relief.</t1107>
<t1108>So I took the paddle and moved a few steps away from the shore, then the canoe already got caught in the current and started moving through the shadows.</t1108> <t1109>The moon was shining and everywhere outside the shadows was lit up like daytime.</t1109> <t1110>I drifted for an hour, but everything was as still as a rock and in a state of complete sleep.</t1110> <t1111>Meanwhile, I had reached the far end of the island.</t1111> <t1112>A calm and cool breeze started to blow, indicating that the night was about to end.</t1112> <t1113>I used the paddle to turn the canoe and pressed its nose against the shore; then I got out of the canoe, took my rifle, and plunged into the forest.</t1113> <t1114>I sat on a log and looked at the sky through the leaves.</t1114> <t1115>I saw that the moon had finished its watch and the darkness was starting to cover the river like a blanket.</t1115> <t1116>But soon a pale line appearing at the tops of the trees indicated that the day was coming.</t1116> <t1117>So I took my rifle and quietly moved towards the place where I saw the campfire, stopping every two minutes to listen around.</t1117> <t1118>But my luck wasn't very good, I couldn't find the place where the fire was.</t1118> <t1119>Then, after a while, a fire burning among the trees caught my eye.</t1119> <t1120>I approached there very carefully and slowly.</t1120> <t1121>Finally, I got close enough to take a look and saw a man lying on the ground.</t1121> <t1122>I started trembling with fear.</t1122> <t1123>He had pulled the blanket over his head and his head was almost in the fire.</t1123> <t1124>I crouched behind the bushes about one and a half to two meters away and started watching him without taking my eyes off.</t1124> <t1125>The air had turned a bit gray and was gradually getting lighter.</t1125> <t1126>Soon the man yawned, stretched, and pulled off the blanket, it was Miss Watson's black slave Jim in front of me!</t1126> <t1127>I had never been so happy to see him.</t1127>
<t1128>Jumping out from the bushes, I said, "What's up, Jim!"</t1128>
<t1129>Suddenly, he flinched and looked at me in horror.</t1129> <t1130>Then he dropped to his knees, clasped his hands together, and began to plead:</t1130>
<t1131>“Don't hurt me – please! I swear I haven't even hurt a fly.</t1131> <t1132>I have always loved the dead, and I did everything I could for them.</t1132> <t1133>Go, return to the riverbank, your home is there.</t1133> <t1134>Don't hurt poor Jim, he has been your friend.</t1134><t1135>”</t1135>
<t1136>It didn't take me long to convince him that I wasn't dead.</t1136> <t1137>Besides, I was so happy to see Jim that I could hardly contain myself.</t1137> <t1138>I no longer felt alone.</t1138> <t1139>I told him that I wasn't the least bit afraid of him telling people where I was.</t1139> <t1140>I kept talking and talking, but he just sat there watching me; he didn't say a word.</t1140> <t1141>So I changed the subject:</t1141>
<t1142>"It's getting quite bright."</t1142> <t1143>"Let's have breakfast."</t1143> <t1144>"Stoke the fire a bit."</t1144><t1145>"</t1145>
<t1146>“What good is it to light a fire when there's nothing but strawberries and grass to cook?</t1146> <t1147>You have a gun, right?</t1147> <t1148>We can eat something better than strawberries.</t1148><t1149>”</t1149>
<t1150>“Strawberries and grass?” I said.</t1150> <t1151>“Were you only eating these?</t1151><t1152>”</t1152>
<t1153>"I couldn't find anything else," he said.</t1153>
<t1154>“Why, how long have you been on the island, Jim?</t1154><t1155>”</t1155>
<t1156>“I came to the bull the night you died.</t1156><t1157>”</t1157>
<t1158>“What, since then?</t1158><t1159>”</t1159>
<t1160>“Yeah… it really is like that.</t1160><t1161>”</t1161>
<t1162>“Since that day, have you only been eating grass and berries?</t1162><t1163>”</t1163>
<t1164>“There isn't, master…</t1164> <t1165>there's nothing else.</t1165><t1166>”</t1166>
<t1167>"So, you must be starving now, am I wrong?"</t1167><t1168>"</t1168>
<t1169>“Honestly, I could even eat a horse.</t1169> <t1170>I'm that hungry.</t1170> <t1171>How long have you been on the island?</t1171><t1172>”</t1172>
<t1173>"Since the night I was killed."</t1173><t1174>"</t1174>
<t1175>“Wow! So, what did you eat?</t1175> <t1176>Burp, you have a gun.</t1176> <t1177>It's different with a gun, yeah.</t1177> <t1178>How nice.</t1178> <t1179>Come on, you shoot something, and I'll light the fire.</t1179><t1180>”</t1180>
<t1181>So we went to where the cannon was, and while we were lighting a fire in a grassy area among those trees, I quickly took out cornmeal, bacon, coffee, a coffee pot, a pan, sugar, and a tin cup.</t1181> <t1182>Jim was astonished because he thought I had done it all by magic.</t1182> <t1183>I also caught a big catfish, and Jim cleaned it with his knife and fried the fish.</t1183>
<t1184>When breakfast was ready, we settled on the grass and ate it hot.</t1184> <t1185>Jim was stuffing everything into his mouth because he was about to die of hunger.</t1185> <t1186>After filling our stomachs well, we lay down and relaxed.</t1186> <t1187>A little later, Jim asked:</t1187>
<t1188>"If you weren't the one who died in that cabin, then who was it, Huck?"</t1188>
<t1189>I told her everything, she said it was clever.</t1189> <t1190>Even Tom Sawyer couldn't come up with a better plan than mine.</t1190> <t1191>Then I asked:</t1191>
<t1192>“So why did you come here, Jim, and how did you get here?</t1192><t1193>”</t1193>
<t1194>First, he lost his composure and didn't know what to say.</t1194> <t1195>Then he spoke:</t1195>
<t1196>"Maybe it's better if I don't say it."</t1196><t1197>"</t1197>
<t1198>"Why, Jim?"</t1198>
<t1199>"Well, it's because of the reason."</t1199> <t1200>"But if you don't tell anyone, I'll tell you, okay?"</t1200><t1201>"</t1201>
<t1202>“If I'm lying, may I lose my eyesight.”</t1202><t1203>”</t1203>
<t1204>“Alright, I believe you, Huck.</t1204> <t1205>I… ran away.</t1205><t1206>”</t1206>
<t1207>“Jim!”</t1207><t1208>”</t1208>
<t1209>“Remember, you said you wouldn't tell anyone...</t1209> <t1210>you know, you weren't supposed to tell anyone, Huck.</t1210><t1211>”</t1211>
<t1212>“Alright, I said.</t1212> <t1213>I won't tell anyone, I said, and I won't.</t1213> <t1214>Really, I will never go back.</t1214> <t1215>Everyone will say that I am a lowly anti-slavery person, they will hate me for staying silent…</t1215> <t1216>but it doesn't matter at all.</t1216> <t1217>I won't tell anyone anything, and I won't go back there anyway.</t1217> <t1218>Yes, now tell me everything from the beginning.</t1218><t1219>”</t1219>
<t1220>“Alright, here’s how it happened.</t1220> <t1221>My owner, that is, Miss Watson, was constantly scolding me and treating me badly, but she always said, ‘I won’t sell you to those folks in Orleans.’</t1221> <t1222>But in recent days, I noticed a slave trader wandering around our place, and I started to get suspicious.</t1222> <t1223>Anyway, one night, late at night, as I was passing by a door left ajar, I heard our old master telling the widow that he was going to sell me to those folks in Orleans; he didn’t actually want to sell me, but he could get eight hundred dollars for me, which was too much money to resist.</t1223> <t1224>The widow tried to talk him out of it, but I didn’t stay to hear more.</t1224> <t1225>I ran away immediately, just like that.</t1225>
<t1226>I went down the slope, intending to steal a boat and then go upstream along the shore, but the surroundings were very crowded, so I hid in the old fisherman's shop by the shore and waited for everyone to leave.</t1226> <t1227>I stayed there all night.</t1227> <t1228>People were constantly running around the area.</t1228> <t1229>Around six in the morning, boats started crossing the river, and by eight or nine, everyone in the boats was talking about your father coming to town and saying you were dead.</t1229> <t1230>The last boat that passed was full of gentlemen and ladies going to see the crime scene.</t1230> <t1231>Some were pulling their boats ashore, resting a bit, and then setting off again; that’s how I learned everything about the ‘murder’.</t1231> <t1232>I was very sad because you died, Huck, but now there's no reason to be sad anymore.</t1232>
<t1233>I hid and stayed in the rubble all day.</t1233> <t1234>My ox-cart was hungry, but I wasn't afraid, because I knew that my old master and the widow would go to the church meeting right after breakfast and wouldn't return all day, and they thought I had gone to herd the cattle early in the morning, so they didn't expect to see me around, and therefore wouldn't notice my absence until it got dark.</t1234> <t1235>The other servants wouldn't notice my absence either, because as soon as the old ladies left, they would all scatter and become invisible in the courtyard.</t1235>
<t1236>When the weather cleared, I went up the road along the riverbank, and about two miles up, I came to a place with no houses.</t1236> <t1237>After that, I made a definite decision about what to do next.</t1237> <t1238>I continued to run on foot, then the dogs started chasing me; if I were to steal a boat and cross to the other side, they would notice the absence of the boat and realize that I had crossed to the other side.</t1238> <t1239>Thus, they would find my trail.</t1239> <t1240>Therefore, the only solution was to get on a raft, then there would be no trace left behind.</t1240>
<t1241>I saw a light approaching from the direction I was hiding, so I immediately dived into the water and pushed a log in front of me to help me swim. In this way, I swam to the middle of the river, then I climbed onto a drifting tree branch; without ever raising my head, I swam against the current until a raft came.</t1241> <t1242>Then I swam to the starboard side and caught the raft.</t1242> <t1243>Shortly after, the moon went behind the clouds and the surroundings darkened.</t1243> <t1244>Taking advantage of this opportunity, I climbed onto the raft and lay down.</t1244> <t1245>All the men on the raft were far away, in the middle of the raft, sleeping next to the fire.</t1245> <t1246>The river was rising and there was quite a current; I calculated that we would reach about twenty-five miles downstream by around four in the morning. Before sunrise, I dived into the water and swam to the shore to hide in the forest on the Illinois side of the river.</t1246>
<t1247>But my luck did not go well.</t1247> <t1248>When we came to almost the other side of the island, the men took a boat and approached my side; there was no point in waiting, so I quietly slipped into the water and started swimming towards the island.</t1248> <t1249>Actually, I thought I could climb the rock from any part of the island, but no, the shore was very steep and rocky.</t1249> <t1250>I came all the way to the tip of the island to find a good place.</t1250> <t1251>I decided to go straight into the forest and not to get involved with any more boats, especially if there were men with guns in them, I wouldn't even approach them.</t1251> <t1252>I had a pipe and some tobacco with me, and there were a few matches left in my hat, my situation wasn't too bad.</t1252><t1253>"</t1253>
<t1254>“So, you haven't had any meat or bread to eat since then?</t1254> <t1255>Why didn't you catch a turtle?</t1255><t1256>”</t1256>
<t1257>“How do you catch it?</t1257> <t1258>If you can't catch up and grab it, how do you manage to hit it with a stone?</t1258> <t1259>Especially at night, how do you do it?</t1259> <t1260>If it's daytime, I must not show myself by the shore, oh no.</t1260><t1261>”</t1261>
<t1262>“So that's how it is.</t1262> <t1263>Of course, you had to spend all your time in the forest.</t1263> <t1264>Did you hear the sound of the cannons?</t1264><t1265>”</t1265>
<t1266>“Ah, yes.</t1266> <t1267>I understood that you were the lord.</t1267> <t1268>I saw you going down the river...</t1268> <t1269>I followed you from behind the bushes.</t1269><t1270>”</t1270>
<t1271>Young birds appeared around, flying a meter or two and landing on branches.</t1271> <t1272>Jim said this was a sign that it would rain.</t1272> <t1273>When chicks flew like this, it meant rain, so he guessed it would mean the same for other young birds as well.</t1273> <t1274>I wanted to catch a few, but Jim didn't allow it.</t1274> <t1275>He said it was akin to death.</t1275> <t1276>Once, his father had gotten very sick, and when someone caught a bird, his old grandmother said his father would die, and indeed, he did.</t1276>
<t1277>Also, Jim said that you shouldn't count the things you eat in the evening, because it brings bad luck.</t1277> <t1278>The same thing happens if you shake the tablecloth after sunset.</t1278> <t1279>And if a man has a beehive, when that man dies, you need to inform the bees before the sun rises the next morning, otherwise all the bees will weaken, stop working, and die.</t1279> <t1280>Jim also said that bees don't sting fools, but I didn't believe it, because I had dealt with them many times and they hadn't stung me.</t1280>
<t1281>Some of the things you told me I had heard before, but I hadn't heard all of them.</t1281> <t1282>Jim knew all kinds of signs.</t1282> <t1283>He said he knew almost everything.</t1283> <t1284>Upon this, I said that apparently all signs bring bad luck and asked if there were any signs that bring good luck.</t1284> <t1285>He said:</t1285>
<t1286>“Very little… and even that is of no use to anyone.</t1286> <t1287>Why do you care so much about when luck will smile on you?</t1287> <t1288>Is it to keep luck away from yourself?” He also added: “If your arms and chest are hairy, then you will either soon or eventually become rich.</t1288> <t1289>This is such a sign that brings luck, but sometimes it can take a very long time to come.</t1289> <t1290>Do you understand?</t1290> <t1291>Maybe at first, you need to wait a long time, so you don't recognize the sign and don't know the signs that will make you rich, God forbid, you might even end up in despair and kill yourself.</t1291><t1292>”</t1292>
<t1293>“Are your arms and chest hairy, Jim?</t1293><t1294>”</t1294>
<t1295>“Is this what you call cold?</t1295> <t1296>Can't you see that it is?</t1296><t1297>”</t1297>
<t1298>“So, are you rich?</t1298><t1299>”</t1299>
<t1300>“No, but once I was rich, and I will be rich again.</t1300> <t1301>At one point, I had fourteen shops, I got into trading, and eventually, I went bankrupt.</t1301><t1302>”</t1302>
<t1303>“What were you buying and selling, Jim?”</t1303>
<t1304>“Well, at first I got into the business of buying and selling animals.</t1304><t1305>”</t1305>
<t1306>“What kind of animal?</t1306><t1307>”</t1307>
<t1308>“Farm animal.</t1308> <t1309>Just the usual cattle and such.</t1309> <t1310>I invested ten dollars in a cow.</t1310> <t1311>But I won't risk more money in the animal business.</t1311> <t1312>The cow soon died.</t1312><t1313>”</t1313>
<t1314>“So you lost ten dollars.</t1314><t1315>”</t1315>
<t1316>“No, I didn't lose all of them.</t1316> <t1317>I only lost about nine of them.</t1317> <t1318>I sold the animal's skin and fat for about ten cents.</t1318><t1319>”</t1319>
<t1320>"So, you have five dollars and ten cents left."</t1320> <t1321>"Did you trade with this again?"</t1321><t1322>"</t1322>
<t1323>“Yes.</t1323> <t1324>You know Old Mr. Bradish’s one-legged Negro, right?</t1324> <t1325>Well, he started a bank and said that whoever deposits a dollar will earn an extra four dollars by the end of the year.</t1325> <t1326>All the Negroes deposited their money in this bank, but they didn't have much money.</t1326> <t1327>I was the only one who had that much money.</t1327> <t1328>So I wanted to get more than four dollars in interest, otherwise I said I would start my own bank.</t1328> <t1329>Of course, that Negro wanted to keep me out of it, because he said there wasn't enough business for two banks, so he said if you deposit five dollars in my bank, then at the end of the year you'll get thirty-five dollars.</t1329>
<t1330>I also made the payment.</t1330> <t1331>So, after that, I was going to make thirty-five more payments and run my business.</t1331> <t1332>Bob, a black man, caught a chest of money and his owner didn't know about it; so I bought it from him and promised to transfer thirty-five dollars to him by the end of the year, but that night someone stole the chest of money and the next day a one-legged black man said the bank went bankrupt.</t1332> <t1333>So none of us got five cents.</t1333><t1334>”</t1334>
<t1335>“So what did you do with the ten cents, Jim?”</t1335>
<t1336>“Actually, I wanted to spend it, but I supposedly saw in a dream that I had to give the money to a black man named Balum – everyone just calls him Balum’s Donkey, he’s a bit slow in the head.</t1336> <t1337>But everyone says he’s lucky, and I’m not lucky at all.</t1337> <t1338>In the dream, it was said that if Balum took the ten cents, he would return the money to me.</t1338> <t1339>Balum took the money and went to church, and the preacher there said that whoever gives their money to the poor is actually giving it to God, and in the end, their money will return a hundredfold.</t1339> <t1340>So Balum gave the ten cents to the poor and started waiting for his money to return.</t1340><t1341>”</t1341>
<t1342>“So, did the money increase, Jim?</t1342><t1343>”</t1343>
<t1344>“No, it never happened.</t1344> <t1345>There was no way for me to get that money, and Balum couldn't do it either.</t1345> <t1346>If I were in his place, I wouldn't give my money without securing my position.</t1346> <t1347>The preacher said, 'You will definitely get a hundred times more money!'</t1347> <t1348>Even if I got my ten cents back, that would be enough, I was very happy with my luck.</t1348><t1349>”</t1349>
<t1350>“Never mind, Jim, just let it go, you are going to be rich one day anyway.</t1350><t1351>”</t1351>
<t1352>“Yes… actually, if you look at it, I am rich now too.</t1352> <t1353>I own myself and I am worth exactly eight hundred dollars.</t1353> <t1354>If only I had that money, I wouldn't want anything else.</t1354><t1355>”</t1355>
<t1356>Ninth Chapter</t1356>
<t1357>When I set out to explore the island, there was a place I found right in the middle; now I wanted to take a look at it.</t1357> <t1358>We set out towards this place and soon found where it was, because the island was only three miles long and a quarter mile wide.</t1358>
<t1359>This was quite a long and steep hill or ridge, and its height was about 12 meters.</t1359> <t1360>We had quite a hard time climbing the hill; the slope was very steep, and the bushes were very dense.</t1360> <t1361>By holding on and climbing, we explored every part of the ridge and finally found a huge cave near the top on the Illinois side.</t1361> <t1362>The cave was the size of two or three rooms, and Jim could stand upright inside it.</t1362> <t1363>It was cooler inside compared to outside.</t1363> <t1364>Jim immediately wanted to move the stuff there, but I said that going up and down the cave every time wouldn't be convenient for us.</t1364>
<t1365>Jim said that if we hide the canoe in a good place and move all the belongings to the cave, we can immediately hide in the cave when someone comes to the island, and without the dogs, they would never find us.</t1365> <t1366>Moreover, the baby birds had said it was going to rain, or did I want everything to get wet?</t1366>
<t1367>Upon this, we went back and got the canoe, paddled to the cave's level, and then carried all our belongings into the cave.</t1367> <t1368>Then, we searched for a nearby spot among the dense willows where we could hide the canoe.</t1368> <t1369>We took out a few fish from the fishing lines and cast the lines back, then started preparing dinner.</t1369>
<t1370>The mouth of the cave was wide enough to fit a large barrel inside, and the ledge next to the entrance was flat enough to light a fire.</t1370> <t1371>So we lit the fire there and cooked our meal.</t1371>
<t1372>We threw a blanket inside as a carpet and ate our meal on it.</t1372><t1373>We also put everything useful at the back of the cave.</t1373><t1374>Before long, it got dark, thunder started rumbling, and lightning began flashing; it seemed the birds were right.</t1374><t1375>Suddenly, a downpour began, it was as if the sky had burst open, I had never seen the wind blow so hard.</t1375><t1376>A full-blown summer storm had erupted.</t1376><t1377>You know, it gets so dark that the outside turns into a strange navy blue, creating a magnificent scene, the rain pours down so heavily that even the trees a short distance away become blurry, as if hiding behind a spider web.</t1377><t1378>Sometimes, with a strong gust, the trees bend and the light-colored undersides of the leaves are revealed.</t1378><t1379>As the wind intensifies, all the tree branches sway wildly.</t1379><t1380>Then everything is cloaked in the darkest navy blue, but with the sudden splitting of the sky, everything turns white.</t1380><t1381>Far away, even hundreds of meters further than before, the tops of the trees can be seen flapping in the wind.</t1381><t1382>Again, everything turns pitch black, then a crackling sound erupts, turning into a rumble and descending to the ground with a growl, echoing downwards as if rolling barrels down a staircase, of course, the stairs here are quite high and the barrels make a lot of noise.</t1382>
<t1383>“Isn't it beautiful, Jim,” I said.</t1383> <t1384>“I wouldn't want to be anywhere else right now.</t1384> <t1385>Pass me another piece of fish and some of that hot cornbread.</t1385><t1386>”</t1386>
<t1387>"If it weren't for Jim, you would have been in big trouble with this mistake.</t1387> <t1388>If you were down there now, you would have been hungry, almost drowned, you would have perished, my dear.</t1388> <t1389>Chickens know when the rain is coming, birds know too, my child.</t1389><t1390>"</t1390>
<t1391>For twelve days, the river rose and finally overflowed its banks.</t1391> <t1392>In the low-lying areas of the island and at the Illinois end, the depth reached one meter.</t1392> <t1393>On the Illinois side, the river had reached a width of miles; but on the Missouri side, the distance was still the same – about half a mile – because the Missouri shore consisted of steep cliff walls.</t1393>
<t1394>During the day, we would explore every part of the island by canoe.</t1394> <t1395>Despite the sun being bright and scorching, the depths of the forest were very cold and dark.</t1395> <t1396>We would weave in and out of the trees; sometimes the branches were so dense that we had to turn back and find another path.</t1396> <t1397>On every fallen rotten tree, you could see rabbits, snakes, and other animals; after the island had been submerged for a day or two, the animals had become tame from hunger, and if you wanted, you could go right up to them and touch them; of course, except for the snakes and turtles – they would slip into the water immediately.</t1397> <t1398>The ridge where our cave was located was filled with animals.</t1398> <t1399>If we wanted, we could have had a lot of domestic animals.</t1399>
<t1400>One night we caught a small piece of a raft made from a tree trunk – it was beautiful pine lumber.</t1400> <t1401>It was six meters wide and four and a half to five meters long, with fifteen to twenty centimeters of it above the water, and its surface was flat and solid.</t1401> <t1402>During the day, we also saw logs coming out of the sawmill, but we let them go; we didn't show ourselves during the daytime.</t1402>
<t1403>One night just before dawn, while we were at the front side of the island, we saw that a wooden house was drifting on the west side.</t1403> <t1404>The house was two stories high and was leaning quite a bit.</t1404> <t1405>We quickly rowed towards the house – we climbed up to a window on the upper floor.</t1405> <t1406>But it was still very dark inside, so we tied the canoe to a secure spot and waited for daylight.</t1406>
<t1407>Before we reached the end of the island, it started to get light.</t1407> <t1408>Then we looked inside through the window.</t1408> <t1409>Inside, there was a bed, a table, two old chairs, and a lot of stuff scattered on the floor; we also saw clothes hanging on the wall.</t1409> <t1410>In the other corner of the room, something resembling a man was lying on the floor.</t1410> <t1411>Jim called out to him:</t1411>
<t1412>"Hey, sen!</t1412><t1413>"</t1413>
<t1414>But there was no movement.</t1414> <t1415>This time I called out, then Jim turned to me:</t1415>
<t1416>“Adam is not sleeping… he is dead.</t1416> <t1417>You stay here…</t1417> <t1418>I will go and check.</t1418><t1419>”</t1419>
<t1420>He went over to the man, leaned in, and after looking carefully, he called out:</t1420>
<t1421>“The man is dead.</t1421> <t1422>Yes, for real, and naked too.</t1422> <t1423>He was shot in the back.</t1423> <t1424>He's probably been lying there for two or three days.</t1424> <t1425>Go inside Huck, but don't look at the man's face, because it's a horrible sight.</t1425><t1426>”</t1426>
<t1427>I didn't look at the man at all.</t1427> <t1428>Jim covered the corpse with a few rags, but he didn't need to; I didn't want to see it.</t1428> <t1429>Worn-out, greasy playing cards were scattered on the ground, there were old whiskey bottles around, and I also saw a few masks made of black cloth; there were also crudely drawn words and pictures on the walls made with charcoal.</t1429> <t1430>Two old and dirty calico dresses, a sun hat, and women's underwear were hanging on the wall; there were also men's clothes.</t1430> <t1431>We carried everything to the canoe, it might come in handy.</t1431> <t1432>There was an old, dirty straw boy's hat on the ground; I took that too.</t1432> <t1433>There was milk in a bottle; also, a cloth stopper was made at the mouth for the baby to suck on.</t1433> <t1434>We were going to take the bottle, but we saw it was broken.</t1434> <t1435>There was an old, shabby console and a chest with broken hinges.</t1435> <t1436>Both were open, but there was nothing of value left inside.</t1436> <t1437>Judging by how things were scattered around, people had left the house in a hurry and hadn't had time to take most of their belongings.</t1437>
<t1438>An old tin lantern, a butcher knife without a handle, a brand new Barlow knife that you could buy from any store for just two bits, a bunch of tallow candles, a tin candle holder, a gourd, a tin cup, an old quilt we took from the bed, a handbag containing needles, beeswax, buttons, and thread, a small hatchet and some nails, some fishing line almost as thick as my little finger and large fish hooks attached to the line, a rolled-up deer skin, a leather dog collar, a horseshoe, a few medicine bottles without labels; and just as we were leaving, a nice currycomb caught my eye.</t1438> <t1439>Jim also found an old violin bow and a wooden prosthetic leg.</t1439> <t1440>The straps of the prosthetic leg were broken, but other than that, it looked like a good leg, though it was too long for me, too short for Jim, and despite searching everywhere, we couldn't find the other leg.</t1440>
<t1441>Thus, overall, we had done a good job.</t1441> <t1442>By the time we were ready to leave the house, we had reached about a quarter mile down the island, and it was midday; so I told Jim to lie down inside the canoe and covered him with a blanket, because if he sat up, people could tell from a long distance that he was a black man.</t1442> <t1443>I rowed towards the Illinois shore, but while doing so, I had drifted nearly half a mile.</t1443> <t1444>As I came back up from the still water along the shore, nothing happened to me, nor did I see anyone.</t1444> <t1445>We had returned home completely safe.</t1445>
<t1446>Tenth Chapter</t1446>
<t1447>After breakfast, I wanted to talk about the dead man and ponder together how he was killed, but Jim objected.</t1447> <t1448>Such conversations would bring bad luck; moreover, the man could come and haunt us, he said that the likelihood of an unburied man haunting people was much higher compared to a properly buried man resting peacefully in his grave.</t1448> <t1449>There was some truth in what Jim said, so I didn't insist, but this matter continued to bother me, I was curious about who killed the man and why.</t1449>
<t1450>When we thoroughly examined the clothes we had bought, we found eight silver dollars sewn into an old coat.</t1450> <t1451>Jim said that the people in that house had stolen the coat because if they had known the money was there, they would have definitely taken the coat with them when they left.</t1451> <t1452>I said that I thought they had also killed the owner of the coat, but Jim didn't want to talk about it.</t1452> <t1453>Then I said:</t1453>
<t1454>“You say this will bring bad luck; but what did you say when I brought the snake skin I found on the top of your back not yesterday, but the day before?</t1454> <t1455>Holding a snake skin with your hand would bring the greatest misfortune in the world, you said.</t1455> <t1456>Well, here's your bad luck!</t1456> <t1457>We found a lot of things, and eight dollars to boot.</t1457> <t1458>I wish we had such bad luck every day.</t1458><t1459>”</t1459>
<t1460>"Don't worry at all, my dear, don't worry at all.</t1460> <t1461>This luck won't last long.</t1461> <t1462>Soon something will happen to us.</t1462> <t1463>Don't forget what I said, it's imminent.</t1463><t1464>"</t1464>
<t1465>He really did come.</t1465> <t1466>It was Tuesday when we had this conversation.</t1466> <t1467>On Friday, while lying on the grass at the upper end of the ridge, I ran out of tobacco.</t1467> <t1468>When I went to the cave to get some, I encountered a rattlesnake.</t1468> <t1469>I killed the snake and coiled it up at the foot of Jim's blanket.</t1469> <t1470>I did this quite naturally, thinking we would have a laugh when Jim found it.</t1470> <t1471>By evening, I had forgotten about the snake, and as I was lighting the lamp, Jim threw himself onto the blanket, and the snake's mate bit him.</t1471>
<t1472>Jim jumped into the air with a shout, and the first thing I saw in the light was a coiled snake ready to strike again.</t1472> <t1473>I killed it in one swift motion with the stick in my hand, and Jim grabbed my father's whiskey bottle and started drinking.</t1473>
<t1474>Because he walked barefoot, a snake had bitten him on the heel.</t1474> <t1475>It was all because I acted like a complete fool.</t1475> <t1476>Wherever you leave a dead snake, its mate will come and coil up next to it.</t1476> <t1477>How could I have forgotten this!</t1477> <t1478>Jim asked me to cut off the snake's head and then skin the rest and cook a bit of it.</t1478> <t1479>I did as he said, he ate the snake meat and said it would help him heal.</t1479> <t1480>He also had me remove the snake's rattle and tie it to his wrist.</t1480> <t1481>This would also work.</t1481> <t1482>After that, I quietly went outside and threw the snake carcasses far away into the bushes; because I was determined to do everything I could so that Jim wouldn't learn it was all my fault.</t1482>
<t1483>Jim was constantly drinking, occasionally losing control and attacking and shouting at those around him, but every time he came to his senses, he would drink a little more from the bottle.</t1483> <t1484>His foot was quite swollen, and his leg was in bad shape, but then gradually the alcohol took effect, so I thought he was fine; but if it were me, I would prefer to draw snake venom rather than drink my father's whiskey.</t1484>
<t1485>Jim couldn't get up for four days and nights.</t1485> <t1486>But then the swelling went down and he started walking around again.</t1486> <t1487>I decided never to hold a snake skin with my hand again, now that I knew what it could lead to.</t1487> <t1488>Jim said he hoped I would believe him next time.</t1488> <t1489>Holding a snake skin was such terrible bad luck that he expected other things to happen too.</t1489> <t1490>He said he would prefer to look at the new moon over his left shoulder a thousand times rather than hold a snake skin with his hand.</t1490> <t1491>I had started to think like him, although I always thought that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder was one of the most thoughtless and foolish things a person could do.</t1491> <t1492>Old Hank Bunker did it once, and even bragged about it; within two years, he got drunk one day, fell from a shot tower, and hit the ground so hard he was almost flat; they say they buried him between two big doors instead of a coffin; I didn't see it.</t1492> <t1493>My father told me.</t1493> <t1494>Anyway, this happened to him because he foolishly looked at the moon that way.</t1494>
<t1495>Days later, the river receded to its old banks, and the first thing we did was bait one of the huge fishing hooks with a skinned rabbit and set a trap to catch a catfish almost as tall as a man.</t1495><t1496>This fish, nearly two meters long, weighed almost ninety kilos.</t1496><t1497>Of course, we couldn't hold it directly; it could have flung us all the way to Illinois.</t1497><t1498>We just stood and watched it thrash and tear around until it drowned.</t1498><t1499>We found a brass mallet, a perfectly round ball, and a bunch of odds and ends in the fish's stomach.</t1499><t1500>When we split the ball with an axe, a spool came out of it.</t1500><t1501>Jim said the spool had been in the fish's stomach for a long time, turning into a ball as it got coated over and over.</t1501><t1502>It was probably the biggest fish ever caught in the Mississippi until that day.</t1502><t1503>Jim said he had never seen a bigger fish either.</t1503><t1504>If we were in the village, it would have fetched quite a good price.</t1504><t1505>They had sold a fish this big by the kilo in the market, and everyone had bought a piece; the fish's flesh was as white as snow and made for good frying.</t1505>
<t1506>The next morning, I said that life was passing slowly and boringly and that I wanted a bit of action.</t1506> <t1507>I thought it would be good to cross the river and see what was happening.</t1507> <t1508>Jim agreed with me, but he said I should go in the dark and be very careful.</t1508> <t1509>Then, after thinking about the matter a bit more, he asked if I could go disguised as a girl using some of those old clothes.</t1509> <t1510>That was indeed a good idea.</t1510> <t1511>So we shortened one of the calico dresses, rolled up the legs of my pants to my knees, and I put on the dress.</t1511> <t1512>When Jim fastened the clasps at the back of the dress, it fit me perfectly.</t1512> <t1513>I put on the sun hat and tied its string under my chin; since the wide brim curved down on both sides, anyone wanting to see my face would have to look in like through a stovepipe.</t1513> <t1514>Jim said that no one would recognize me even in daylight.</t1514> <t1515>I practiced all day long and gradually started to move quite comfortably in the dress; according to Jim, the only thing that didn't resemble girls was my walk; he also told me to stop lifting my skirt and plunging my hand into my pocket.</t1515> <t1516>It got better when I paid attention to that.</t1516>
<t1517>As soon as darkness fell, I set off towards the Illinois shore by canoe.</t1517>
<t1518>I approached the town from a bit below the ferry dock and, with the help of the current, reached the shore from the very bottom of the town.</t1518> <t1519>I tied up the canoe somewhere and started walking along the beach.</t1519> <t1520>I saw a light in a small cabin that had been uninhabited for a long time and wondered who had moved in there.</t1520> <t1521>I approached quietly and looked inside through the window.</t1521> <t1522>Inside, a woman in her forties was sitting at a pine table, knitting by candlelight.</t1522> <t1523>Her face didn't look familiar to me; she must have been a stranger, because there wasn't a single person in the town that I didn't know.</t1523> <t1524>This was what you called luck, as I had started to feel a bit regretful, fearing that someone might recognize my voice and I would get caught.</t1524> <t1525>But if this woman had been living in such a small town for a short time, she could tell me everything I wanted to know; that's why I knocked on the door and decided to absolutely remember that I was a girl.</t1525>
<t1526>Chapter Eleven</t1526>
<t1527>"Come in," said the woman.</t1527> <t1528>I went inside.</t1528>
<t1529>“Sit down.</t1529><t1530>”</t1530>
<t1531>I sat down.</t1531> <t1532>With her sparkling little eyes, she examined me from head to toe.</t1532>
<t1533>“What's your name, let's see?</t1533><t1534>”</t1534>
<t1535>“Sarah Williams.</t1535><t1536>”</t1536>
<t1537>“Where do you live then?</t1537> <t1538>Around here?</t1538><t1539>”</t1539>
<t1540>“No.</t1540> <t1541>I’m from Hookerville, seven miles down.</t1541> <t1542>I walked all the way here, I’m exhausted, I swear.</t1542><t1543>”</t1543>
<t1544>"You must be hungry."</t1544> <t1545>"Let me get you something."</t1545><t1546>"</t1546>
<t1547>“No, no, I'm not hungry.</t1547> <t1548>When I got really hungry, I stopped by a farm two miles down; that's why I'm full now.</t1548> <t1549>That's why I was so late anyway.</t1549> <t1550>My mother is very sick, we ran out of money and food, so I came to talk to my uncle Abner Moore.</t1550> <t1551>He lives at the upper end of this town, according to my mother.</t1551> <t1552>I've never been here before.</t1552> <t1553>Do you know my uncle?</t1553><t1554>”</t1554>
<t1555>“No; but I don't know everyone yet.</t1555> <t1556>It's not even been two weeks since I moved here.</t1556> <t1557>The upper end of the town is quite far away.</t1557> <t1558>If you want, you can stay here overnight.</t1558> <t1559>You can also take off your hat.</t1559><t1560>”</t1560>
<t1561>"No need," I said, "I should continue on my way after resting a bit.</t1561> <t1562>I'm not afraid of heading out in the dark.</t1562><t1563>"</t1563>
<t1564>He said he wouldn't let me go alone, her husband was supposed to come in about an hour and a half and could take me.</t1564> <t1565>Then she started talking about her husband, she talked about their relatives upriver, she talked about their relatives downriver, they used to be very well off, but they were wondering if they made a mistake by coming to this town, they wished they had stayed in the old place – and so on and so forth; I was beginning to fear that I made a mistake by coming to her to find out what was happening in the town; but then she brought up my father and the murder, and that's when I started listening to her chatter wholeheartedly.</t1565> <t1566>She talked about how Tom Sawyer and I found six thousand dollars (though she thought it was ten thousand), everything about my father and what a troublemaker he was, and also what a troublemaker I was; finally, she got to the part where I was killed.</t1566>
<t1567>“Who did it?” I asked.</t1567> <t1568>“We heard a lot of things about what happened in Hookerville, but we couldn't find out who killed Huck Finn.</t1568><t1569>”</t1569>
<t1570>"Actually, almost everyone here wants to know who killed him.</t1570> <t1571>Some think that the killer is old Finn himself.</t1571><t1572>"</t1572>
<t1573>"No way..."</t1573> <t1574>"Really?"</t1574><t1575>"</t1575>
<t1576>“At first, everyone thought that way.</t1576> <t1577>The man will never know how close he came to being lynched.</t1577> <t1578>But before nightfall, the situation changed and people concluded that a runaway black man named Jim committed the murder.</t1578><t1579>”</t1579>
<t1580>“Well, but he…</t1580><t1581>”</t1581>
<t1582>I bit my lip.</t1582> <t1583>It would have been better if I hadn't said anything.</t1583> <t1584>The woman continued talking, she hadn't even noticed that I was about to interrupt.</t1584>
<t1585>“The black man escaped the very night Huck Finn was killed.</t1585> <t1586>That's why they put a bounty on his head…</t1586> <t1587>three hundred dollars.</t1587> <t1588>They also put a bounty on old Finn's head…</t1588> <t1589>two hundred dollars.</t1589> <t1590>He came to town the morning after the murder and told what happened, he was on the deck while the search was conducted with the steamboat, but then he left.</t1590> <t1591>They wanted to lynch him before nightfall, but he was nowhere to be found.</t1591> <t1592>The next day it was noticed that the black man was gone, no one had seen him since ten o'clock on the night of the murder.</t1592> <t1593>That's why the murder was pinned on him, while people were thinking this, old Finn came back the next day and asked Judge Thatcher for money to search for the black man all over Illinois.</t1593> <t1594>The judge gave him some money, Finn drank until evening and wandered around with a few rather tough-looking strangers until midnight, then took them and left.</t1594> <t1595>He hasn't returned since then; for a while no one looked for him, but rumors spread and people now think he killed his own son and made it look like robbers did it.</t1595> <t1596>That way he could get hold of Huck's money without wasting time on a long trial.</t1596> <t1597>People think he's despicable enough to do that.</t1597> <t1598>I think he's a hypocrite too.</t1598> <t1599>If he doesn't come back by the end of the year, he'll get away with it.</t1599> <t1600>No one can prove anything anyway; by then things will settle down and he'll easily get Huck's money.</t1600><t1601>”</t1601>
<t1602>"You are right, ma'am.</t1602> <t1603>I also don't think there will be any obstacles in front of him.</t1603> <t1604>Does no one think anymore that the murder was committed by the black man?</t1604><t1605>"</t1605>
<t1606>“Of course it does.</t1606> <t1607>Many people think he committed the murder.</t1607> <t1608>But they will soon catch the black man; maybe if they scare him a little, he'll confess to the murder.</t1608><t1609>”</t1609>
<t1610>"How will they catch him; did they even start chasing him?"</t1610><t1611>"</t1611>
<t1612>"Man, how naive you are!</t1612><t1613>Do you think three hundred dollars are picked up from the roadside every day?</t1613><t1614>Some people think the black man isn't very far from here.</t1614><t1615>I'm one of them... but I haven't told anyone.</t1615><t1616>A few days ago, I was talking to the old couple living in the wooden cabin next door, and they said almost no one goes to the island they call Jackson Island.</t1616><t1617>I asked if no one lives there.</t1617><t1618>No; no one lives there, they said.</t1618><t1619>I didn't say anything else, but I started thinking.</t1619><t1620>I'm almost sure I saw smoke there, it was rising from the head of the island a day or two ago.</t1620><t1621>So, I said to myself, can't the black man be hiding there; in any case, it's worth going there to investigate.</t1621><t1622>I haven't seen smoke since that day, maybe he's gone now, that is, if it was him: Though my husband will go and check, he'll take a man with him.</t1622><t1623>He had gone up the river, but he returned today and as soon as he arrived two hours ago, I told him everything.</t1623><t1624>"</t1624>
<t1625>I was so on edge that I couldn't stay still anymore.</t1625> <t1626>I needed to do something with my hands; so I took the sewing needle on the table and tried to thread it.</t1626> <t1627>My hands were trembling and I couldn't get the thread through the hole.</t1627> <t1628>The woman stopped talking, and when I looked up, I saw that she was looking at me curiously and smiling slightly.</t1628> <t1629>I pretended to be interested in the needle and thread; in fact, I was interested.</t1629> <t1630>I said:</t1630>
<t1631>“Three hundred dollars is not a small amount of money.</t1631> <t1632>It would be great if my mother took it.</t1632> <t1633>Will your husband go there tonight?</t1633><t1634>”</t1634>
<t1635>“Yes, of course.</t1635> <t1636>He went to the town with the man I mentioned to find a boat, and he will also try to borrow an extra rifle.</t1636> <t1637>They will leave after midnight.</t1637><t1638>”</t1638>
<t1639>“Wouldn't they see better if they waited for the daylight?</t1639><t1640>”</t1640>
<t1641>“Yes.</t1641> <t1642>But wouldn't the black man see better then?</t1642> <t1643>After midnight, he would probably be asleep, so they could quietly move through the forest and search the surroundings, and if there's a fire, they would find it more easily.</t1643><t1644>”</t1644>
<t1645>"This had never occurred to me."</t1645><t1646>"</t1646>
<t1647>The woman kept looking at me with curiosity, and I didn't feel comfortable at all.</t1647> <t1648>A little later, she spoke again:</t1648>
<t1649>“What did you say my name was, sweetheart?</t1649><t1650>”</t1650>
<t1651>“M…</t1651> <t1652>Mary Williams.</t1652><t1653>”</t1653>
<t1654>When she first asked, I felt like I didn't say Mary, so I couldn't lift my head to look; I think I said Sarah; that's why I felt cornered and was afraid that the woman would read it from my face.</t1654> <t1655>I wished the woman would say something more; the longer we sat in silence, the more uneasy I became.</t1655> <t1656>Finally, the woman spoke:</t1656>
<t1657>“When you first came in, I thought you said your name was Sarah, honey, isn't that right?</t1657><t1658>”</t1658>
<t1659>“Yes, ma'am, that's what I said.</t1659> <t1660>Sarah Mary Williams.</t1660> <t1661>Sarah is my first name.</t1661> <t1662>Some call me Sarah; some call me Mary.</t1662><t1663>”</t1663>
<t1664>"Is that so?"</t1664>
<t1665>"Yes, ma'am."</t1665><t1666>"</t1666>
<t1667>I was feeling better, but I still wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.</t1667> <t1668>I still couldn't lift my head to look at the woman.</t1668>
<t1669>Upon this, the woman began to talk about the difficulty of making a living, how they lived in poverty, mice running around as if the house belonged to them, and so on, and I started to feel more at ease.</t1669> <t1670>She was right about the mice.</t1670> <t1671>From time to time, you could see them poking their noses out of the hole in the corner.</t1671> <t1672>She explained that when she was alone, she kept something to throw at the mice, otherwise they wouldn't leave her in peace.</t1672> <t1673>She showed me a rod made of twisted lead and said that she usually threw it very accurately, but she was afraid she might miss because she had injured her arm a couple of days ago.</t1673> <t1674>Still, she watched for an opportunity and threw it at a mouse she saw, but the lead missed the mouse, and she held her arm saying "Ouch!"</t1674> <t1675>She asked me to hit the next mouse.</t1675> <t1676>I wanted to leave before the old man came, but of course, I couldn't just rush out.</t1676> <t1677>I took the lead ball in my hand and threw it at the first mouse I saw; if it had stayed where it was, it would have been in trouble.</t1677> <t1678>The woman said my throw was top-notch and she had no doubt I would hit the next one.</t1678> <t1679>She went and fetched the lead, then took out a skein of yarn and asked for my help.</t1679> <t1680>I extended my hands and she looped the skein over them, then continued talking about her husband's work.</t1680> <t1681>But she paused at one point:</t1681>
<t1682>"Be on guard against the mice.</t1682> <t1683>It's best if the bullet stays in your lap.</t1683><t1684>"</t1684>
<t1685>He threw the lead ball towards my lap while still talking, and as I clamped my legs together to avoid dropping it, he continued to speak.</t1685> <t1686>But he only spoke for a minute.</t1686> <t1687>Finally, he took the burden from my hands, looked straight into my face, and asked in a sweet voice:</t1687>
<t1688>“Tell me…</t1688> <t1689>what is your real name?</t1689><t1690>”</t1690>
<t1691>"What did you say, ma'am?"</t1691><t1692>"</t1692>
<t1693>“What is your real name?</t1693> <t1694>Is it Bill, Tom, or Bob?..</t1694> <t1695>What is it?</t1695><t1696>”</t1696>
<t1697>At that moment, I started trembling like a leaf, I didn't know what to do.</t1697>
<t1698>“Please don't make fun of a poor girl, ma'am,” I said.</t1698> <t1699>“If I am bothering you, I will immediately…”</t1699><t1700>”</t1700>
<t1701>“No, you are not going.</t1701> <t1702>Sit down and don't move anywhere.</t1702> <t1703>I won't harm you, and you can be sure that I won't betray you.</t1703> <t1704>Just reveal your secret, you can trust me.</t1704> <t1705>I can keep a secret; moreover, I might be able to help you.</t1705> <t1706>If you want, even my husband can help you.</t1706> <t1707>It's clear that you are a runaway apprentice.</t1707> <t1708>So what?</t1708> <t1709>There's nothing wrong with that.</t1709> <t1710>They treated you harshly, and you decided to run away.</t1710> <t1711>I'm thinking of your well-being, my child, why would I betray you?</t1711> <t1712>Come on, tell me…</t1712> <t1713>be a good child.</t1713><t1714>”</t1714>
<t1715>Then I said that there was no point in pretending anymore, I would act completely honestly and tell him everything, but he must not go back on his word.</t1715> <t1716>Then I told him that my father and mother had died, that they had given me to a mean old farmer thirty miles away from the river, and that he had treated me so badly that I could no longer bear it; he had gone on a trip for a few days, so I took the opportunity to steal some of his daughter's old clothes and ran away; I had been on the road for three nights and had come thirty miles; I was traveling at night, hiding and sleeping during the day; I had taken a bag full of meat and bread from the house, and my provisions would last longer.</t1716> <t1717>I thought my Uncle Abner Moore would take me in, so I had come to the town of Goshen.</t1717>
<t1718>“Is this Goshen, my dear? This isn't Goshen.</t1718> <t1719>This is St.</t1719> <t1720>Petersburg.</t1720> <t1721>Goshen is ten miles up the river.</t1721> <t1722>Who told you this was Goshen?</t1722><t1723>”</t1723>
<t1724>"This morning at dawn, before going to sleep among the trees, I met a man.</t1724> <t1725>He told me to turn right when I reached the fork in the road, and after five miles, I would reach Goshen.</t1725><t1726>"</t1726>
<t1727>“He was probably drunk.</t1727> <t1728>He gave you the directions completely wrong.</t1728><t1729>”</t1729>
<t1730>“No wonder, it was swaying back and forth, but that’s of no use now.</t1730> <t1731>I must continue on my way.</t1731> <t1732>I will reach Goshen before dawn breaks.</t1732><t1733>”</t1733>
<t1734>“Wait a minute.</t1734> <t1735>Let me pack you something to eat.</t1735> <t1736>You can eat it on the way.</t1736><t1737>”</t1737>
<t1738>After stuffing some food into my hand, he continued:</t1738>
<t1739>“Tell me...</t1739> <t1740>when a cow is lying down, which part of it gets up first?</t1740> <t1741>Answer quickly, don't think about it.</t1741> <t1742>Which part gets up first?</t1742><t1743>”</t1743>
<t1744>"The back side, ma'am.</t1744><t1745>"</t1745>
<t1746>“What about the horse?”</t1746>
<t1747>"The front will lift, ma'am."</t1747><t1748></t1748>
<t1749>“On which side of the tree does moss grow?</t1749><t1750>”</t1750>
<t1751>“On the north side.</t1751><t1752>”</t1752>
<t1753>“If fifteen cows are grazing on a hillside, how many of them have their heads turned in the same direction?</t1753><t1754>”</t1754>
<t1755>"All of them, ma'am.</t1755><t1756>"</t1756>
<t1757>“Alright, it’s clear that you know farm life.</t1757> <t1758>I was afraid that you might be deceiving me again.</t1758> <t1759>What is your real name, let’s see?</t1759><t1760>”</t1760>
<t1761>"George Peters, ma'am."</t1761><t1762>"</t1762>
<t1763>“Alright, try not to forget this, George.</t1763> <t1764>Don't forget and don't tell me your name is Elexander before you leave, and especially don't make up the lie that your name is George-Elexander when your cover is blown.</t1764> <t1765>Also, don't approach women in that shabby calico dress.</t1765> <t1766>Your imitation of a girl is quite bad, but maybe you can fool the men.</t1766> <t1767>For heaven's sake, child, the next time you need to thread a needle, don't try to push the needle's eye through the thread; keep the needle steady and pass the thread through the eye...</t1767> <t1768>Women always do it this way, but men always do the opposite.</t1768> <t1769>Also, if you're going to throw something at a mouse or whatever, rise up on your toes, lift your hand as awkwardly as possible over your head, and then throw it two or three meters away from the mouse.</t1769> <t1770>Throw directly using your shoulder, as if your arm is moving from the shoulder...</t1770> <t1771>Do it like girls do; don't throw like a man by bending your wrist and elbow and opening your arm to the side.</t1771> <t1772>And remember, a girl spreads her knees apart to catch something that falls into her lap; she doesn't keep her knees together like you did when catching the lead ball.</t1772> <t1773>I realized you were a boy when you first tried to thread the needle; then I had you do the others to be sure.</t1773> <t1774>Now go to your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get into trouble, send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, that is, to me, and I'll do what I can to help.</t1774> <t1775>Continue along the river path and don't forget to take shoes and socks with you the next time you go out.</t1775> <t1776>The river path is rocky, and your feet won't be in good shape by the time you reach Goshen.</t1776><t1777>”</t1777>
<t1778>I went fifty meters up along the river, then walked back on my own footprints and moved to the hidden spot below the house where my canoe was.</t1778> <t1779>I immediately jumped into the canoe and hurriedly moved away.</t1779> <t1780>After rowing against the current along the shore until I reached the head of the island, I began to cross the river.</t1780> <t1781>I took off the hat because I didn't want it to obstruct my view.</t1781> <t1782>When I reached the middle of the river, I heard the clock chime; I stopped and listened; the sound was faintly coming over the water but I heard it clearly – eleven.</t1782> <t1783>When I reached the head of the island, even though I was very tired, I didn't wait to catch my breath; I immediately carried some wood to the place where my old camp was and built a huge fire in a high and dry spot.</t1783>
<t1784>Then I got back into the canoe and rowed about a mile and a half downstream to our main location.</t1784> <t1785>I landed, quickly passed through the trees, climbed the slope, and entered the cave.</t1785> <t1786>Jim was sleeping like a log inside.</t1786> <t1787>I immediately woke him up.</t1787>
<t1788>“Get up quickly and pack, Jim! We don't have a minute to lose.</t1788> <t1789>They're after us!</t1789><t1790>”</t1790>
<t1791>Jim didn't ask anything, he didn't even say a word; his behavior over the next half hour was enough to show how scared he was.</t1791> <t1792>Now, everything we owned was on our raft, and we were ready to take it out from behind the willow curtain where we had hidden it.</t1792> <t1793>We had put out the fire in the cave from the very beginning and never lit even a candle outside again.</t1793>
<t1794>I wanted to sail a bit away from the island to see what was happening, but even if there was a boat there, I couldn't see it; because it was impossible to distinguish anything in the shadows under the starlight.</t1794> <t1795>Then we launched the raft and started descending through the shadows, not moving or uttering a word as we passed the foot of the island.</t1795>
<t1796>Chapter Two</t1796>
<t1797>It was probably around one o'clock by the time we reached the lower part of the island.</t1797> <t1798>Don't even ask how slowly the raft was moving.</t1798> <t1799>If we saw a boat, we were going to immediately jump into the canoe and escape to the Illinois shore.</t1799> <t1800>Fortunately, no boats were in sight, because we hadn't thought to place the rifle, fishing rods, or food in the canoe.</t1800> <t1801>We were too drenched in sweat to think of so many things.</t1801> <t1802>Loading everything onto the raft was not a wise move at all.</t1802>
<t1803>I thought that if the men went to the island, they would find the fire I had lit and lie in ambush, waiting for Jim to return throughout the night.</t1803> <t1804>Anyway, they were already far from us, and if the fire I had lit did not deceive them, it was not my fault.</t1804> <t1805>For this, I had made as good a plan as I could.</t1805>
<t1806>As the first light of dawn began to appear, we pulled the raft to a wooded shore that caught our eye as we came to a large bend on the Illinois side.</t1806> <t1807>We covered the raft nicely with branches we cut from the shore, which was lined with densely packed poplar trees like the teeth of a comb.</t1807> <t1808>When we finished our work, it looked as if there was a natural depression among the poplars; the raft was completely invisible.</t1808>
<t1809>On the Missouri side, there were mountains, while on the Illinois side, there were dense forests, and since the river flowed from the Missouri side, we had no fear of encountering anyone where we were.</t1809> <t1810>We lay there all day watching the rafts and steamers descend towards Missouri and the steamers coming up struggle with the vast river in the middle.</t1810> <t1811>I told Jim about the conversation I had with that woman; he said she was a cunning woman, and if she were after us, she wouldn't just sit by the campfire – no, sir, she would definitely bring a dog with her.</t1811> <t1812>But couldn't she have told her husband to go get a dog?</t1812> <t1813>Jim said that the woman had probably already thought of that before the men set out and that they were likely delayed because they went to get a dog from the upper part of the town, otherwise, we wouldn't be at this shallow spot sixteen or seventeen miles down from the village – we would find ourselves back in the old town.</t1813> <t1814>I said that as long as they didn't catch us, I wouldn't care why they didn't catch us.</t1814>
<t1815>When it started to get dark, we poked our heads out from between the dense poplars and looked up, down, and across; there was nothing; so Jim took apart a few of the upper planks of the raft to make a narrow shelter to get under in the extreme heat and rain, and also to keep our belongings dry.</t1815> <t1816>He made space on the raft for the shelter, then raised it about half a meter above the raft's floor; this way, our blankets and traps would no longer be affected by the waves created by the steamers.</t1816> <t1817>We made a 15-centimeter deep hole in the middle of the shelter out of mud, and supported its perimeter with planks to prevent it from spreading; this was for making a fire in rainy or cool weather, and the shelter would block the fire from being seen from a distance.</t1817> <t1818>We also made an extra steering pole, because the others could get stuck somewhere and break.</t1818> <t1819>We set up a short forked stick to hang the old tattered lantern, because when you see a steamer coming down the river, you must light the lantern so it doesn't hit you; but if we weren't at one of those places they call "crossings," there was no need to light the lantern for steamers going upriver.</t1819> <t1820>The river was still quite high, and the low-lying banks were still underwater; so the ships going upriver could prefer places with less current instead of using the usual channel.</t1820>
<t1821>On the second night, we traveled for another seven or eight hours, thanks to the current, we were probably going faster than four miles per hour.</t1821> <t1822>We fished, chatted, and when we got sleepy, we tried to wake up by swimming a bit.</t1822> <t1823>Drifting on the wide and calm river while lying on our backs and watching the stars felt a bit gloomy, we didn't want to speak loudly at all, nor did we laugh much – occasionally we would let out short, muffled laughs.</t1823> <t1824>Generally, the weather was very good and nothing happened to us – neither that night, nor the next, nor the night after that.</t1824>
<t1825>Every night we passed by towns, some of which were on dark slopes in the distance, and all you could see were clusters of bright lights, you couldn't distinguish a single house.</t1825> <t1826>On the fifth night, we passed St.</t1826> <t1827>Louis, it was as if the whole world was illuminated.</t1827> <t1828>St.</t1828> <t1829>The people in St.</t1829> <t1830>Petersburg used to say that twenty to thirty thousand people lived in St. Louis, but I didn't believe it until I saw the beautiful flood of lights covering the entire slope on that still night.</t1830> <t1831>There was no sound, everyone was in a deep sleep.</t1831>
<t1832>Every night around ten o'clock, I would secretly go to the shore near a small village; I would buy flour, pastrami, or some other food worth ten or fifteen cents; sometimes I would steal a chicken, but cooking it was difficult and took a long time.</t1832> <t1833>My father always used to say, if you come across a chicken, don't miss the opportunity; because even if you didn't eat it yourself, you could always find someone who would, and kindness never went unrewarded.</t1833> <t1834>I never saw my father not eat the chicken himself, but he would still say that.</t1834><t1835>–</t1835>
<t1836>In the mornings, before the break of dawn, I would sneak into the cornfields and borrow a watermelon, melon, pumpkin, or fresh corn.</t1836> <t1837>My father used to say that if you intend to pay for something later, there's no harm in borrowing it; but the widow said that this was just dressing up theft and that an honest person would never steal.</t1837> <t1838>According to Jim, the widow was somewhat right, and my father was somewhat right too; so the best thing was to cross off a few items from our list and say we wouldn't borrow those again – then there would be no harm in borrowing the others.</t1838> <t1839>One night, while drifting down the river, we talked at length about the matter and tried to decide whether to cross off the watermelon, the melon, or something else from the list.</t1839> <t1840>By dawn, we had both thought enough about the matter and decided to cross off wild apples and dates from the list.</t1840> <t1841>Before that, we weren't sure if we were doing the right thing, but now we both felt at ease.</t1841> <t1842>It didn't matter much to me anyway, because wild apples weren't very good and the dates wouldn't be ripe for another two or three months.</t1842>
<t1843>If we occasionally saw a waterfowl that had either woken up very early in the morning or had not gone to bed early enough at night, we would shoot it.</t1843> <t1844>Considering all of it together, it can be said that we were quite comfortable.</t1844>
<t1845>St.</t1845> <t1846>On the fifth night after descending below St. Louis, a great storm broke out after midnight; thunder was rumbling; lightning was flashing, and it was pouring rain.</t1846> <t1847>We went inside the shelter and let the raft drift aimlessly.</t1847> <t1848>When the lightning flashed, we could see the wide river stretching straight ahead of us and rocky cliffs on both sides.</t1848> <t1849>At one point, I called out, “Hey, Jim, look ahead!”</t1849> <t1850>There was a steamboat wrecked on the rocks ahead of us.</t1850> <t1851>We were drifting directly towards the boat.</t1851> <t1852>We could see the boat very clearly in the lightning's light.</t1852> <t1853>It was lying on its side, part of its upper deck was above water, we could see the ship's smokestacks clearly, there was a chair next to the big bell, and when another lightning flashed, I saw an old wide-brimmed hat hanging on the back of it.</t1853>
<t1854>Breathing in all that mysterious air in the middle of the storm at night and seeing the wreck lying so sorrowful and all alone in the middle of the river made me feel the things that every boy would feel.</t1854> <t1855>I wanted to get on the ship and wander inside, to see what was there.</t1855>
<t1856>“Let's get on the ship, Jim,” I said.</t1856>
<t1857>Jim didn't want to at first.</t1857>
<t1858>“What are we doing in the wreckage in this weather?</t1858> <t1859>It says in the good book, you live and let live, why should we poke around beyond that?</t1859> <t1860>What's your problem?</t1860> <t1861>Besides, there might be guards at the wreckage.</t1861><t1862>”</t1862>
<t1863>“What guard would be there,” I said.</t1863> <t1864>“What else is left to guard besides the upper cabin; moreover, who would risk their life on such a night for a ship that could break apart and drift down the river at any moment?”</t1864> <t1865>Jim couldn't find a response to this, so he remained silent.</t1865> <t1866>“Besides,” I said, “we might find something valuable to borrow from the captain's cabin.</t1866> <t1867>I bet there are cigars...</t1867> <t1868>each worth at least five cents.</t1868> <t1869>Steamboat captains are rich; they earn sixty dollars a month; so if they want something, they don't mind the cost.</t1869> <t1870>Put a candle in your pocket, I won't feel at ease without searching the ship, Jim.</t1870> <t1871>Do you think Tom Sawyer would pass by this wreck?</t1871> <t1872>He definitely wouldn't.</t1872> <t1873>He would say this is an adventure...</t1873> <t1874>Yes, he would call it an adventure; even if it was the last thing he did, he would climb onto the wreck.</t1874> <t1875>And wouldn't he do it in style?</t1875> <t1876>He would be so full of swagger.</t1876> <t1877>You'd think he was Christopher Columbus setting out to discover the Kingdom of God.</t1877> <t1878>I wish Tom Sawyer were here!</t1878><t1879>”</t1879>
<t1880>Jim grumbled a bit more, but finally gave in.</t1880> <t1881>He said we absolutely shouldn't talk unless we had to, and if we did, we should whisper.</t1881> <t1882>The lightning once again showed the wreck just in time, and we caught the dock on the starboard side and tied the raft.</t1882>
<t1883>The deck was well above the water level.</t1883> <t1884>We boarded the ship from the dock and proceeded towards the captain's cabin.</t1884> <t1885>We were feeling the ground with our feet, advancing with our arms outstretched to avoid tripping over the ropes, because it was so dark that we couldn't see anything.</t1885> <t1886>Soon, we reached the skylight and climbed on top of it; a step later, we had reached the open door of the captain's cabin.</t1886> <t1887>Just then, we saw a light in the cabin and heard someone speaking in a low voice!</t1887>
<t1888>Jim whispered that he was feeling bad and wanted to go back.</t1888> <t1889>I agreed with him and was preparing to return to the raft, but just then I heard someone inside moaning: "Please don't, boys; I swear I won't tell anyone!</t1889><t1890>"</t1890>
<t1891>Another person answered loudly:</t1891>
<t1892>“You are lying, Jim Turner.</t1892> <t1893>You have done this before.</t1893> <t1894>You always want more than your share and every time you get it by threatening to snitch on us if we don't give it to you.</t1894> <t1895>But this time you have pushed us too far.</t1895> <t1896>You are the vilest, most treacherous dog in this country.</t1896><t1897>”</t1897>
<t1898>At that moment, Jim had moved away to go to the raft.</t1898> <t1899>But I couldn't go anywhere out of curiosity.</t1899> <t1900>I told myself that Tom Sawyer wouldn't turn his back and leave in such a situation, so I wouldn't either; I would find out what was happening there.</t1900> <t1901>I started crawling through the narrow passage in the dark; finally, there was only one passenger cabin left between me and the captain's cabin.</t1901> <t1902>When I poked my head out, I saw a man lying on the ground with his hands and feet tied, two men standing over him, one holding a dimmed lantern and the other holding a gun.</t1902> <t1903>The one with the gun had the barrel pointed at the man on the ground's head and was saying:</t1903>
<t1904>“I won't show any mercy!</t1904> <t1905>I shouldn't anyway...</t1905> <t1906>You despicable man!</t1906><t1907>”</t1907>
<t1908>The man on the ground was trembling violently.</t1908> <t1909>"Please, don't do it, Bill.</t1909> <t1910>I won't tell anyone.</t1910><t1911>"</t1911>
<t1912>Whenever the man on the ground said this, the man with the lantern would laugh and say:</t1912>
<t1913>“No doubt about it! You've never said anything this true before.”</t1913> <t1914>At one point, he said: “Look how he's begging!</t1914> <t1915>But if we hadn't acted first and tied him up, he would have killed both of us.</t1915> <t1916>And for what?</t1916> <t1917>For a whole lot of nothing.</t1917> <t1918>Just because we're defending our own rights…</t1918> <t1919>for this.</t1919> <t1920>But from now on, you won't be able to threaten anyone, Jim Turner.</t1920> <t1921>Put down that gun, Bill.</t1921><t1922>”</t1922>
<t1923>"I can't lower it, Jake Packard.</t1923> <t1924>I'm determined to kill him... just like he shot poor Hatfield...</t1924> <t1925>Doesn't he deserve it?</t1925><t1926>"</t1926>
<t1927>“But I don't want him to die, listen to me first.</t1927><t1928>”</t1928>
<t1929>"Don't be absent, Jake Packard! As long as I live, I will never forget you!" said the man lying on the ground, amidst sobs.</t1929>
<t1930>Packard didn't care at all, he hung his lantern on a nail and started walking towards the place where I was waiting in the dark and signaled Bill to follow him.</t1930> <t1931>I crawled back about two meters as fast as I could, but since the ship was listing, I hadn't moved quickly enough; so I retreated towards an upper passenger cabin to avoid being caught.</t1931> <t1932>The man advanced in the dark by feeling his way and when he reached the level of the cabin where I was, he called out behind him:</t1932>
<t1933>“Come…</t1933> <t1934>Let's go in here.</t1934><t1935>”</t1935>
<t1936>Packard entered, and Bill followed him.</t1936> <t1937>But by the time they arrived, I had climbed to the top bunk, huddled in the corner, and was writhing in regret for coming there.</t1937> <t1938>Then they stood there and started talking, leaning their hands on the edge of the bunk.</t1938> <t1939>I couldn't see them, but I could tell where they were from the smell of whiskey on their breath.</t1939> <t1940>I was glad I didn't drink whiskey, but it didn't really matter, because they couldn't notice me since I wasn't even breathing.</t1940> <t1941>I was very scared.</t1941> <t1942>Besides, one can't both breathe and listen to them at the same time.</t1942> <t1943>They were speaking in hushed and angry tones.</t1943> <t1944>Bill's intention was to kill Turner.</t1944> <t1945>He said:</t1945>
<t1946>“He said he would betray us, and he will do exactly that, I have no doubt.</t1946> <t1947>Even if we both give him our shares now, it won't make any difference after what we've done.</t1947> <t1948>I know for sure that he will snitch on us.</t1948> <t1949>He will testify against us.</t1949> <t1950>Listen to me.</t1950> <t1951>Let's just end all his troubles once and for all.</t1951><t1952>”</t1952>
<t1953>“I think so too,” Packard whispered.</t1953>
<t1954>“Damn it, I was beginning to think you had something else on your mind.</t1954> <t1955>Alright then.</t1955> <t1956>Let's go finish this job.</t1956><t1957>”</t1957>
<t1958>“Wait a minute, I haven't finished what I have to say yet.</t1958> <t1959>Now you listen to me.</t1959> <t1960>If necessary, we will strike, but there are quieter ways to resolve this issue.</t1960> <t1961>This is what I say: There's no point in sticking our necks out when there's another way that has no risk but will have the same effect.</t1961> <t1962>Am I wrong?</t1962><t1963>”</t1963>
<t1964>“You are absolutely right.</t1964> <t1965>Okay, but how are we going to handle this job this time?</t1965><t1966>”</t1966>
<t1967>“I have an idea: We'll search the area thoroughly again and check if there's anything we missed in the cabins, then we'll row to the shore and hide everything.</t1967> <t1968>After that, we'll wait.</t1968> <t1969>If you ask me, this wreck will break apart within two hours and drift down the river.</t1969> <t1970>Do you understand?</t1970> <t1971>The man will drown and there will be no one else to blame but himself.</t1971> <t1972>I think doing something like this is much better than shooting him.</t1972> <t1973>Shooting a man when there's another way doesn't sound good at all.</t1973> <t1974>It's neither wise nor does it preserve our morals.</t1974> <t1975>Am I wrong?</t1975><t1976>”</t1976>
<t1977>“Yes, you are right.</t1977> <t1978>But what if the wreckage doesn't break apart and disappear?</t1978><t1979>”</t1979>
<t1980>“Alright, we can still wait for two hours and see, can't we?</t1980><t1981>”</t1981>
<t1982>“Alright then, let's go.</t1982><t1983>”</t1983>
<t1984>So they set to work; I, drenched in cold sweat, crawled out of the cabin and made my way to the bow.</t1984> <t1985>It was pitch dark there, but still, I whispered, "Jim!" and a groan came from right beside my elbow.</t1985>
<t1986>“Hurry up, Jim, we don't have time to dawdle or moan; there's a gang of murderers inside, and if we don't find their boat and untie it to trap them here, they'll be stranded and one of them will be killed.</t1986> <t1987>If we find the boat, they'll all be stranded...</t1987> <t1988>The sheriff can come and catch them too.</t1988> <t1989>Hurry up... hurry!</t1989> <t1990>I'll check the starboard side, you check the port side.</t1990> <t1991>Go and start from there with the raft...</t1991><t1992>”</t1992>
<t1993>“Oh, Tanğım, Tanğım! Is it gone? There is no raft or anything on the river, the rope has come undone, it's gone...</t1993> <t1994>we are stranded on this shore!</t1994><t1995>”</t1995>
<t1996>Chapter Thirteen</t1996>
<t1997>My breath got stuck in my throat, I almost fainted.</t1997>
<t1998>Being trapped in the same wreck with such a gang!</t1998> <t1999>But it was no time to get emotional.</t1999> <t2000>We had to find that boat immediately… we were going to use it ourselves.</t2000> <t2001>So, trembling with fear, we started to move towards the dock, progressing very slowly; it felt like it took a week to reach the stern.</t2001> <t2002>There was no trace of the boat.</t2002> <t2003>Jim said he couldn't go any further – he was so scared that he had no strength left.</t2003> <t2004>But I explained to him that if we stayed in this wreck, we would be in big trouble.</t2004> <t2005>So we started walking again.</t2005> <t2006>We passed behind the captain's cabin, then reached for the skylight, holding onto the covers as part of the window was underwater.</t2006> <t2007>As we got closer to the corridor door, we finally located the boat!</t2007> <t2008>I could barely see its silhouette.</t2008> <t2009>I didn't know how to thank God.</t2009> <t2010>A second later, I would have jumped onto the boat, but just then the door opened.</t2010> <t2011>One of the men poked his head out just a few steps away from me!</t2011> <t2012>At that moment, I thought I was done for, but he pulled his head back in and called out:</t2012>
<t2013>"Get that damn lantern out of sight, Bill!"</t2013>
<t2014>He threw a full bag into the boat, then got in and sat down himself.</t2014> <t2015>This was Packard.</t2015> <t2016>Then Bill appeared and boarded the boat.</t2016> <t2017>Packard whispered:</t2017>
<t2018>“Everything is ready...</t2018> <t2019>Row the oars!</t2019><t2020>”</t2020>
<t2021>I was so exhausted that I was about to let go of the lid I was holding onto.</t2021> <t2022>But Bill hesitated:</t2022>
<t2023>“Wait a moment...</t2023> <t2024>Did you search him?</t2024><t2025>”</t2025>
<t2026>“No.</t2026> <t2027>Didn't you call?</t2027><t2028>”</t2028>
<t2029>“No.</t2029> <t2030>Then your share of the cash is still on you.</t2030><t2031>”</t2031>
<t2032>“What are we waiting for, let's take it immediately; there's no point in taking the goods and leaving the money.</t2032><t2033>”</t2033>
<t2034>“Shouldn't she understand what we are going to do to her?</t2034><t2035>”</t2035>
<t2036>“He probably won't understand.</t2036> <t2037>Besides, what does it matter, let's take them all.</t2037> <t2038>Come on, let's go.</t2038><t2039>”</t2039>
<t2040>They got out of the boat and boarded the ship again.</t2040>
<t2041>Since he was on the upper side of the ship, he bumped into the backs of doors; within half a second, I was in the boat, and Jim came tumbling after me.</t2041> <t2042>I took out my knife, cut the rope, and we set off!</t2042>
<t2043>We did not touch the oars, we did not speak at all, we did not even whisper, we did not dare to breathe.</t2043> <t2044>We were rapidly moving away without making any noise, narrowly missing the wheel, separating from the stern, and a few seconds later we were about a hundred meters away from the wreckage, which had completely sunk into darkness, with not the slightest trace left, we were safe now.</t2044>
<t2045>After going down the river for about three to four hundred meters, a lantern flickered like a spark at the door of the captain's cabin; the bandits had noticed that the boat was leaving and realized that they were in at least as much trouble as Jim Turner.</t2045>
<t2046>Then Jim took to the oars and we started following our raft.</t2046> <t2047>For the first time, I began to worry about the men – I guess I hadn't had the time before.</t2047> <t2048>I started to think about how terrifying it must be to be in such a situation, even for killers.</t2048> <t2049>Who knows, maybe one day I myself would become a killer, would I like it then?</t2049> <t2050>So I turned to Jim:</t2050>
<t2051>"Let's land a hundred meters below or above the first light we see, and after arranging a good hiding place for both you and the boat, I'll go find someone.</t2051> <t2052>Let them save that gang of murderers, and when the time comes, let them hang them.</t2052><t2053>"</t2053>
<t2054>But I couldn't realize this idea; because a worse storm than the last one started shortly after.</t2054> <t2055>It was pouring rain and not a single light was visible; presumably, everyone was asleep.</t2055> <t2056>We continued down the river, searching for lights and our raft.</t2056> <t2057>After a while, the rain lightened, but the sky was still cloudy and the thunder continued; at one point, when lightning struck, we saw a black object floating ahead of us and steered towards it.</t2057>
<t2058>We had found it on Tuesday and were very happy when we got back on it.</t2058> <t2059>We had seen a light on the right side, on the shore.</t2059> <t2060>I suggested going there.</t2060> <t2061>The boat was half-filled with the odds and ends the gang had stolen from the wreck.</t2061> <t2062>We stacked everything on the raft and told Jim to keep going downstream, light a lamp after about two miles, and keep it lit until I got there; then I took the oars and started rowing towards the light.</t2062> <t2063>As I got closer to the light, three or four more lights appeared – they were all on the hillside.</t2063> <t2064>So, this was a village.</t2064> <t2065>I pulled the oars out of the water just above the light on the shore and continued with the current.</t2065> <t2066>As far as I could see, this light was coming from a lantern hung on the mast of a double-hulled ferry.</t2066> <t2067>I searched around to find where the watchman was sleeping and finally found him curled up on the deck bollard at the bow, sleeping.</t2067> <t2068>I nudged his shoulder two or three times and started crying.</t2068>
<t2069>Adam was startled for a moment, but then, seeing that it was just a boy in front of him, he stretched and yawned.</t2069>
<t2070>“What's the matter, child?</t2070> <t2071>Don't cry, come on.</t2071> <t2072>What's your trouble?</t2072><t2073>”</t2073>
<t2074>“My father, my mother, my sister, and…”</t2074><t2075>”</t2075>
<t2076>Then I started crying again.</t2076>
<t2077>“Pull yourself together, don't let yourself go like this; we all have problems, yours will be solved too.</t2077> <t2078>Come on, tell me, what happened to them?</t2078><t2079>”</t2079>
<t2080>“They... they... are you the guardian of the ship?</t2080><t2081>”</t2081>
<t2082>“Yes,” he said, with an air of pride.</t2082> <t2083>“I am the captain, the owner, the first mate, the helmsman, the watchman, and the chief deckhand; sometimes I am also the cargo and the passenger.</t2083> <t2084>I am not as rich as our Jim Hornback, so I cannot hand out generous tips to everyone who comes, nor can I throw money around like him; I have said it many times, I never want to be in his place; because for me, life means the life of a sailor, even if they laid all the riches of the world at my feet, I could not live two miles outside of town, in a place where there is nothing exciting.</t2084> <t2085>I said...</t2085><t2086>”</t2086>
<t2087>I immediately interrupted:</t2087>
<t2088>“They are in big trouble and…</t2088><t2089>”</t2089>
<t2090>“Whose?</t2090><t2091>”</t2091>
<t2092>“My father, my mother, my sister, and Mrs. Hooker; if you can reach them by going up with the ferry…</t2092><t2093>”</t2093>
<t2094>“Where up?</t2094> <t2095>Where are they?</t2095><t2096>”</t2096>
<t2097>“They are in the wreckage.</t2097><t2098>”</t2098>
<t2099>"Which wreckage?"</t2099><t2100>"</t2100>
<t2101>“There is only one wreck.</t2101><t2102>”</t2102>
<t2103>“So, are you talking about Walter Scott?</t2103><t2104>”</t2104>
<t2105>“Yes.</t2105><t2106>”</t2106>
<t2107>"Oh my God! For the love of God, what are they doing there?"</t2107><t2108></t2108>
<t2109>“They probably didn't step on it on purpose!</t2109><t2110>”</t2110>
<t2111>“That's right, why would they leave!</t2111> <t2112>My God, if they don't leave there soon, they won't stand a chance!</t2112> <t2113>Wow, how did they get themselves into such a complicated situation?</t2113><t2114>”</t2114>
<t2115>"Don't even ask.</t2115> <t2116>Mrs. Hooker had come to visit the town, you know...</t2116><t2117>"</t2117>
<t2118>“Hah, that place near Çardaklı Pier… keep going.</t2118><t2119>”</t2119>
<t2120>“You see, he had come there to visit an acquaintance, and as evening fell, he and the black woman boarded the horse ferry and went to his friend's place to spend the night… the woman's name slips my mind…</t2120> <t2121>but then they lost control of the tiller, drifted about two miles downstream, and ran aground on some wreckage, capsizing.</t2121> <t2122>The ferryman, the black woman, and all the horses were swept away, but Mrs. Hooker clung to the wreckage and then climbed on top of it.</t2122> <t2123>About an hour after dark, we arrived there with our sailboat, and it was so dark that we didn't notice the wreck until we hit it; we capsized too, but all of us except Bill Whipple were saved…</t2123> <t2124>oh poor thing, he never harmed anyone… I wish he had been saved instead of me…</t2124><t2125>”</t2125>
<t2126>"Bite your tongue, my child!</t2126> <t2127>I've never heard such a crazy story.</t2127> <t2128>So, what did you do next?</t2128><t2129>"</t2129>
<t2130>“We also clung to the wreckage and climbed on top of it, shouting for help, but the river was so wide that no one could hear us.</t2130> <t2131>Then my father said that someone needed to go to the shore and get help.</t2131> <t2132>I was the only one who could swim, so I volunteered, and Mrs. Hooker also asked me to come here and find her uncle if I couldn't find help before, saying he would solve the problem.</t2132> <t2133>I landed about a mile downstream and have been shuttling between houses ever since, trying to get people to do something; but they all said, ‘What, in this darkness and storm?</t2133> <t2134>It's impossible, try the steam ferry,’ they said.</t2134> <t2135>If you go and...</t2135><t2136>”</t2136>
<t2137>“My God, of course I'll go, I don't know how I'll go but I will go; but who will pay for it?</t2137> <t2138>Do you think your father has money…</t2138><t2139>”</t2139>
<t2140>"Don't worry about that.</t2140> <t2141>Miss Hooker specifically told me, her uncle Hornback...</t2141><t2142>"</t2142>
<t2143>“There are a thousand deck cannons!</t2143> <t2144>His uncle?</t2144> <t2145>Now look, run upstairs, go to that light over there, and when you get there, turn west. After a quarter mile, you'll reach a tavern; ask them to take you to Jim Hornback, he will pay the bill.</t2145> <t2146>Just don't dawdle, because he will want to be informed as soon as possible.</t2146> <t2147>Tell him that his nephew will safely reach the shore before he arrives in town.</t2147> <t2148>Now get going; I'll turn this corner and wake up the engineer.</t2148><t2149>”</t2149>
<t2150>I started running towards the light, but as soon as the man turned the corner, I went back, got into my boat, and pushed it into the water. Then, I rowed about five hundred and fifty meters upstream in the calm waters and hid among the wooden boats when I found a suitable spot; because I wouldn't be at ease until I saw the ferry move.</t2150> <t2151>But when I thought about what I had done, the fact that I had gone through so much trouble for that gang made me feel at ease, many people wouldn't go to such lengths.</t2151> <t2152>I wished the widow would hear about it.</t2152> <t2153>She would probably be proud of me for helping these notorious criminals, because the widow and good people are most interested in rascals and pests.</t2153>
<t2154>Soon I saw the wreckage, it was rapidly sliding down as a dark mass!</t2154> <t2155>For a moment, a cold shiver ran through my whole body, then I immediately grabbed the oars and approached.</t2155> <t2156>It had sunk very deep, and I realized shortly after that there was no chance of anyone being alive inside.</t2156> <t2157>I circled around and called out, but no one answered; everything was engulfed in silence.</t2157> <t2158>My heart ached a little for the gang, but not too much, after all, if they could endure it, so could I.</t2158>
<t2159>Soon the ferry appeared; I rowed towards the fast-flowing middle of the river, and when I realized I had reached a place where I could no longer be seen, I gathered the oars and turned around to watch the ferry circle around the wreck, looking for Mrs. Hooker's body; Captain Hornback knew that at least Uncle would want to see the body; but soon the ferry gave up and headed to the shore, and I started to move downstream in the roaring waters.</t2159>
<t2160>It felt like a very long time had passed before Jim's light appeared; when I first saw it, it seemed to be burning a thousand miles away.</t2160> <t2161>By the time we arrived, the sky in the east had started to turn slightly gray, so we landed on an island, hid the raft, sank the boat, and then lay down and slept like the dead.</t2161>
<t2162>Chapter Fourteen</t2162>
<t2163>When we started investigating what the gang had stolen from the wreck after waking up, we found boots, blankets, clothes, and a lot of other things; there were also many books, a binocular, and three boxes of cigars.</t2163><t2164>Neither of us had ever been this rich before.</t2164><t2165>The cigars were top-notch.</t2165><t2166>In the afternoon, we lay among the trees, chatted a lot, I read the books, and we generally had a good time.</t2166><t2167>I told Jim everything that happened in the wreck and on the ferry and said that these kinds of things were adventures; but Jim said he didn't want any more adventures.</t2167><t2168>When I went to the pilot house, he had gone back to get on the raft and was shocked to find it gone, because no matter how things turned out, it would affect him; if no one saved him, he would drown, and if someone did save him, they would take him to town to claim the reward, and Miss Watson would definitely sell him to the South.</t2168><t2169>He was really right; he was almost always right anyway; he had an unusual intelligence for a black man.</t2169>
<t2170>I told Jim about the kings, dukes, counts, and the like that I had read a lot about, how fancily they dressed, the airs they put on, how they called each other "your majesty" instead of "sir," referred to each other as "your excellency," "your highness," etc.; Jim's eyes were wide open because the matter interested him.</t2170>
<t2171>“I didn't know there were so many kings,” he said.</t2171> <t2172>“Actually, I hadn't heard of any king other than old King Solomon, and besides him, I only saw a king on a playing card.</t2172> <t2173>How much does a king earn?</t2173><t2174>”</t2174>
<t2175>“Earn?” I said.</t2175> <t2176>“If he wants, he can earn a thousand dollars a month, he can take as much as he wants; everything already belongs to him.</t2176><t2177>”</t2177>
<t2178>"It's good, right?</t2178> <t2179>So, what will we do with it to make money?</t2179><t2180>"</t2180>
<t2181>“They do nothing!</t2181> <t2182>Your words are just talk…</t2182> <t2183>They just sit on the throne.</t2183><t2184>”</t2184>
<t2185>"Ha! Is there such a thing?"</t2185><t2186>"</t2186>
<t2187>“Of course, it can happen.</t2187> <t2188>They just sit on the throne.</t2188> <t2189>If a war breaks out, they might get up, then they go to war.</t2189> <t2190>But other than that, they lie around or hunt birds… they just hunt birds and…</t2190> <t2191>Shh!..</t2191> <t2192>did you hear a sound?</t2192><t2193>”</t2193>
<t2194>We went to check immediately, but it was nothing more than the sound of a steamboat paddle coming from the bend below; so we turned back.</t2194>
<t2195>"Yes," I said.</t2195> <t2196>"At other times, when things get very boring, they quarrel with the parliament; if everyone doesn't do as they say, they behead them.</t2196> <t2197>But usually, they hang out in the harem.</t2197><t2198>"</t2198>
<t2199>"What are you stuck on?"</t2199><t2200>"</t2200>
<t2201>"In the harem.</t2201><t2202>"</t2202>
<t2203>"What is this?"</t2203><t2204>"</t2204>
<t2205>"The place where he keeps his wives.</t2205> <t2206>Don't you know the harem?</t2206> <t2207>Solomon had one too; he had almost a million wives.</t2207><t2208>"</t2208>
<t2209>“Yes, right; I…</t2209> <t2210>I had completely forgotten about it.</t2210> <t2211>It was always noisy like his house.</t2211> <t2212>There was quite a bit of noise coming from the children's room, right?</t2212> <t2213>They were always arguing, the noise would rise up at that time.</t2213> <t2214>However, everyone says that Solomon is the wisest man who has ever lived until today.</t2214> <t2215>But I never believe them.</t2215> <t2216>Why?</t2216> <t2217>Would a wise man constantly want to live in such noise and commotion?</t2217> <t2218>No... he wouldn't want that in his life.</t2218> <t2219>A wise man would go and open a factory, and then when he wants to rest, he would close the factory.</t2219><t2220>”</t2220>
<t2221>“But still, Solomon was the wisest man; because the widow lady told me this, and she said it with her own mouth.</t2221><t2222>”</t2222>
<t2223>“So what if he said it!</t2223> <t2224>I have never heard of a more incompetent man than him.</t2224> <t2225>He almost split a child in two, did you hear that?</t2225><t2226>”</t2226>
<t2227>“Yes, the widow told me every detail.</t2227><t2228>”</t2228>
<t2229>“Then listen carefully!</t2229> <t2230>Isn't this the strangest idea you've ever heard in the world?</t2230> <t2231>Think about it for a moment.</t2231> <t2232>Do you see that tree?</t2232> <t2233>One of those women is the tree; and you are the root.</t2233> <t2234>I am Solomon; and this torn banknote is the child.</t2234> <t2235>Both of you want the money.</t2235> <t2236>What do I do?</t2236> <t2237>To find out who the money belongs to, wouldn't I ask all your neighbors and give the money to the right person?</t2237> <t2238>Any sensible person would do that.</t2238> <t2239>But no.</t2239> <t2240>Instead, I split the money in two, giving half to you and half to the other woman.</t2240> <t2241>Solomon thinks of doing the same with the child.</t2241> <t2242>Now I ask you: What use is a torn banknote?</t2242> <t2243>You can't buy anything with it.</t2243> <t2244>What use is a split child?</t2244> <t2245>Honestly, I wouldn't take such a child even if you gave me a million.</t2245><t2246>”</t2246>
<t2247>“But wait a minute, Jim, you haven't understood the essence of the matter...</t2247> <t2248>you haven't even come close.</t2248><t2249>”</t2249>
<t2250>“Who? Me? Come on, son.</t2250> <t2251>Tell me the truth and don't lie.</t2251> <t2252>When I see something sensible, I understand it immediately.</t2252> <t2253>There's no common sense in this matter.</t2253> <t2254>It was like a man trying to solve a child's problem by asking a woman, who wouldn't even think to find shelter in the rain.</t2254> <t2255>Don't talk to me about Solomon, Huck, I know his kind.</t2255><t2256>”</t2256>
<t2257>“But I'm telling you, you haven't understood the real issue.</t2257><t2258>”</t2258>
<t2259>“What good would it do if I understood?</t2259> <t2260>I know what I know.</t2260> <t2261>Besides, the real issue is much more than this.</t2261> <t2262>It's about Süleyman's upbringing.</t2262> <t2263>For example, think of a man with one or two children, can he easily neglect his children?</t2263> <t2264>No, he cannot neglect them, he can't afford to.</t2264> <t2265>He knows the value of a child.</t2265> <t2266>But if a man has five million children running around his house, then the situation changes.</t2266> <t2267>He would treat one child like a cat because he has other children.</t2267> <t2268>There are always more anyway.</t2268> <t2269>One or two children don't matter to Süleyman.</t2269> <t2270>Damn him!</t2270><t2271>”</t2271>
<t2272>I had never seen a black man like this.</t2272> <t2273>Once an idea got into his head, it was never possible to change it.</t2273> <t2274>He was more furious at Süleyman than any other black man I knew.</t2274> <t2275>So, I left Süleyman aside and talked about other kings.</t2275> <t2276>I told him about Louis XVI, who was beheaded in France a long time ago; I added that his heir, his son, would have become king, but they captured him, imprisoned him, and according to some, he died there.</t2276>
<t2277>"Poor little child," said Jim.</t2277>
<t2278>“But some say that he escaped from prison and fled the country, coming to America.</t2278><t2279>”</t2279>
<t2280>“That's good then!</t2280> <t2281>Although he was quite alone in this town.</t2281> <t2282>There's no one in this town, right?</t2282><t2283>”</t2283>
<t2284>"No."</t2284><t2285>""</t2285>
<t2286>"Then he cannot find a throne for himself.</t2286> <t2287>What can he do in this situation?</t2287><t2288>"</t2288>
<t2289>"I don't know."</t2289> <t2290>"Some become police officers; others teach French to people."</t2290><t2291>"</t2291>
<t2292>“Why, Huck, don't the French talk like us?</t2292><t2293>”</t2293>
<t2294>"No, Jim; you won't understand a single word they say... not a single word."</t2294><t2295>"</t2295>
<t2296>“No way, how did it happen!</t2296> <t2297>How am I supposed to understand that?</t2297><t2298>”</t2298>
<t2299>“I don't know, but you just wouldn't understand.</t2299> <t2300>I had learned something about their conversation from a book.</t2300> <t2301>Let's say a man comes up to you and says parle-vu-franse...</t2301> <t2302>what would you think?</t2302><t2303>”</t2303>
<t2304>“I don't think about anything, I just shoot one in the middle of his forehead.</t2304> <t2305>That is, if he's not white.</t2305> <t2306>I would never allow a black man to talk to me like that.</t2306><t2307>”</t2307>
<t2308>"But he didn't say anything to you.</t2308> <t2309>He just asked if you could speak French.</t2309><t2310>"</t2310>
<t2311>“Haa, okay, but why isn't it cooling properly?</t2311><t2312>”</t2312>
<t2313>“But she's asking, you see.</t2313> <t2314>That's how the French ask.</t2314><t2315>”</t2315>
<t2316>"But this is very absurd, I don't want to hear anything else."</t2316> <t2317>"It doesn't make any sense."</t2317><t2318>"</t2318>
<t2319>“Listen now, Jim; do cats talk like us?</t2319><t2320>”</t2320>
<t2321>“No, cats don't talk like that.</t2321><t2322>”</t2322>
<t2323>“What about the cow?</t2323><t2324>”</t2324>
<t2325>“No, cows don't talk either.</t2325><t2326>”</t2326>
<t2327>“Do cats talk like cows or do cows talk like cats?</t2327><t2328>”</t2328>
<t2329>“No, it can't be.</t2329><t2330>”</t2330>
<t2331>“It's perfectly natural for the two of them to speak differently from each other, isn't it?</t2331><t2332>”</t2332>
<t2333>“Of course.</t2333><t2334>”</t2334>
<t2335>“Well, isn't it normal and correct for the cat and the cow to speak differently from us?</t2335><t2336>”</t2336>
<t2337>“Of course, sure.</t2337><t2338>”</t2338>
<t2339>“Then isn't it normal and right for a French person to speak differently from us?</t2339> <t2340>Answer this, let's see.</t2340><t2341>”</t2341>
<t2342>“Is a cat a human, Huck?</t2342><t2343>”</t2343>
<t2344>“No.</t2344><t2345>”</t2345>
<t2346>“So, do you really think so?</t2346> <t2347>Why would a cat speak like a human?</t2347> <t2348>Well, is a cow a human?</t2348> <t2349>Or is a cow a cat?</t2349><t2350>”</t2350>
<t2351>"No; none of them."</t2351><t2352>"</t2352>
<t2353>“Then he won't speak like the others from this place.</t2353> <t2354>A French person?</t2354><t2355>”</t2355>
<t2356>“Yes.</t2356><t2357>”</t2357>
<t2358>“Alright then!</t2358> <t2359>Damn it, why doesn't this Frenchman speak like a normal person?</t2359> <t2360>You answer him, come on!</t2360><t2361>”</t2361>
<t2362>There was no point in wasting my breath any longer...</t2362> <t2363>You can't teach a black person to argue.</t2363> <t2364>So I gave up.</t2364>
<t2365>Fifteenth Chapter</t2365>
<t2366>We were calculating that if we went three more nights, we would reach Cairo, at the very bottom of Illinois, at the mouth of the Ohio River, which was exactly where we wanted to go.</t2366> <t2367>We would sell the raft, board a steamboat, and go up the Ohio to the free states, and then our troubles would be over.</t2367>
<t2368>The second night, the fog set in and we pulled up to a shore to tie the raft, because there was no point in trying to escape in the fog; but as I rowed ahead with the canoe tied to the raft to speed up, I found nothing to throw the rope at except for thin saplings.</t2368> <t2369>I threw the rope and tied it to a sapling on the shore, but the current was so strong that the raft, which was a bit behind, passed me and pulled the rope so fast that it uprooted the sapling and drifted away.</t2369> <t2370>The fog was getting denser and denser.</t2370> <t2371>I felt terrible, I was so scared that I couldn't move a finger for almost half a minute…</t2371> <t2372>then I lost sight of the raft, it was impossible to see even twenty meters ahead.</t2372> <t2373>I jumped back into the canoe and went to the stern, grabbed the oars, but the canoe didn't move.</t2373> <t2374>I had been in such a hurry that I forgot to untie the oar's rope.</t2374> <t2375>I immediately got up and tried to untie the rope, but I was so excited that my hands were trembling and I couldn't do anything.</t2375>
<t2376>I followed the raft down the river by keeping close to the shore.</t2376> <t2377>As long as I didn't stray from the shore, there was no problem, but the islet was only sixty meters long, and a few seconds after reaching its end, I found myself in a blinding white mist, with no idea where I was going.</t2377>
<t2378>It occurred to me that rowing would be useless; I could crash into the shore or shallow water as soon as I started; I had to stay still and go with the current.</t2378> <t2379>In such a situation, it was really hard not to move your hands.</t2379> <t2380>I called out ahead and waited for a response.</t2380> <t2381>My spirits lifted when I heard someone faintly calling out from somewhere in the distance.</t2381> <t2382>I immediately started moving towards the sound, while also straining my ears to hear it again.</t2382> <t2383>When I heard it the second time, I realized I was going to the right of where the sound was coming from, not directly towards it.</t2383> <t2384>The next time, I was heading to the left of where the sound was coming from – and I hadn't gotten much closer, because I was rowing either to the right or the left, but the sound was coming straight from ahead.</t2384>
<t2385>I hoped that our foolish Jim would think of hitting something like a pan, he should have kept hitting it continuously; but since he didn't do that, the silences between his calls became a problem for me.</t2385> <t2386>I rowed forward with all my strength and soon heard the sound behind me.</t2386> <t2387>By now, I was completely bewildered.</t2387> <t2388>Either someone else was calling out or I was going in the wrong direction.</t2388>
<t2389>I threw the oar into the boat.</t2389> <t2390>I heard the voice again, it was behind me once more but in a different place; the voice kept coming and kept changing places, and I kept responding; finally, I started hearing the voice in front of me again and realized that the current had turned the canoe's head downstream and things were falling into place, of course, if the person calling out to me was indeed Jim and not someone else.</t2390> <t2391>I absolutely couldn't distinguish the sounds coming through the mist; because nothing looks natural in the mist, and the sounds don't seem natural either.</t2391>
<t2392>The sound continued and about a minute later, I was gliding along a steep shore where the ghostly forms of large trees loomed within the mists.</t2392> <t2393>The current grabbed me and flung me to the left, and as I passed through the water plants, the water roared and the current battered the plants.</t2393>
<t2394>A few seconds later, everything turned completely white again and the sounds ceased.</t2394> <t2395>I was listening to my heartbeat without moving, it must have beaten a hundred times until I took another breath.</t2395>
<t2396>Then I gave up trying.</t2396> <t2397>I had understood what the matter was.</t2397> <t2398>The shore we had just seen belonged to an island, and Jim was on the other side of the island.</t2398> <t2399>This was not a shore you could pass by in ten minutes.</t2399> <t2400>It had big trees like normal islands; it was five or six miles long and at least half a mile wide.</t2400>
<t2401>Without making a sound, I listened intently for fifteen minutes.</t2401> <t2402>Meanwhile, I was of course moving at four or five miles per hour, but I wasn't even thinking about it.</t2402> <t2403>No, it felt like you weren't moving at all on the water; if a passing branch caught your eye, you wouldn't think about how fast you were going; you'd hold your breath and think, wow, how fast that branch is moving.</t2403> <t2404>If you think you won't worry or feel lonely when you get lost alone in the fog at night, try it once – then you'll see.</t2404>
<t2405>Then, for half an hour, I called out from time to time; finally, I heard someone shouting back from afar and tried to follow the voice, but I couldn't manage it.</t2405> <t2406>At that moment, I realized I had entered the sandbanks, because I could vaguely see sandbanks on either side of me, sometimes with only a narrow channel in between, and even when I couldn't see the sandbanks, I knew they were there because I could hear the current hitting dead branches and debris piled up on the shore.</t2406> <t2407>Soon, I lost the voices among the sandbanks, which I had only tried to follow for a short while anyway, because it was worse than trying to follow will-o'-the-wisps in the marsh.</t2407> <t2408>I had never thought that a voice could come from so many places and change location so frequently.</t2408>
<t2409>I had to push off from the sandy shores four or five times with all my strength, because I didn't want to hit the islands here and there in the river; surely the raft must have been getting stuck in some places on the shore from time to time, otherwise it would have already gone down the river and become too far away to hear – it was just moving a little faster than me.</t2409>
<t2410>It seemed that I had once again reached a freely flowing part of the river, but I couldn't hear anyone calling from around.</t2410> <t2411>Maybe Jim had gotten caught on a branch or something, which would mean he was done for.</t2411> <t2412>I was now thoroughly exhausted and felt like lying down in the canoe and letting everything take its course.</t2412> <t2413>Of course, I didn't want to sleep, but I was so sleepy that I couldn't help it, so I decided to take a little nap.</t2413>
<t2414>It seems my sleep lasted longer than a nap, because when I woke up, stars were twinkling above me, the fog had completely lifted, and I had entered a wide bend of the river with my canoe in reverse.</t2414> <t2415>At first, I couldn't understand where I was; I thought I was dreaming; then I slowly began to remember what had happened before I fell asleep, but I could only vaguely recall it, as if it had happened not just a moment ago, but last week.</t2415>
<t2416>The river was incredibly wide here, and on both banks, there were very tall and dense trees; as far as I could see in the starlight, they stood like a straight wall.</t2416> <t2417>When I looked downstream, I saw a black spot on the water.</t2417> <t2418>I immediately moved towards it, but when I got closer, I saw that it was nothing but a few logs tied together.</t2418> <t2419>Then I saw another spot and chased after it, then followed another one, and this time I had come to the right place.</t2419> <t2420>The raft was in front of me.</t2420>
<t2421>When I boarded the raft, Jim was sitting with his head between his knees, sleeping, and his right hand was resting on the steering oar.</t2421> <t2422>The other oar had broken off and the raft was covered all over with branches, leaves, and mud.</t2422> <t2423>It was clear that he had also gone through very difficult moments.</t2423>
<t2424>Without wasting any time, I lay down on the raft right under Jim's nose and turned towards Jim, starting to yawn and stretch my fists.</t2424>
<t2425>“Hi, Jim, I fell asleep, didn't I?</t2425> <t2426>Why didn't you wake me up?</t2426><t2427>”</t2427>
<t2428>“Dear God, is that you, Huck? And you're not dead...</t2428> <t2429>you haven't drowned...</t2429> <t2430>have you come back?</t2430> <t2431>No way, it can't be this good to be true.</t2431> <t2432>Let me see you, son, let me touch you.</t2432> <t2433>No, you're not dead!</t2433> <t2434>You've come back again, your voice is just like our Huck's voice, and you look just like him...</t2434> <t2435>our Huck, thank God!</t2435><t2436>”</t2436>
<t2437>“What's wrong with you, Jim? Have you been drinking?</t2437><t2438>”</t2438>
<t2439>“Drinking?</t2439> <t2440>Me, drinking?</t2440> <t2441>So, was there even an opportunity to drink?</t2441><t2442>”</t2442>
<t2443>“Okay, but then why are you saying such crazy things?</t2443><t2444>”</t2444>
<t2445>“How crazy, man?</t2445><t2446>”</t2446>
<t2447>“How so?</t2447> <t2448>You were talking about me coming back and other things, as if I didn't exist!</t2448><t2449>”</t2449>
<t2450>“Huck…</t2450> <t2451>Huck Finn, look me in the eye; look me in the eye.</t2451> <t2452>Hadn't you already gone?</t2452><t2453>”</t2453>
<t2454>“Leave?</t2454> <t2455>What do you mean, for God's sake?</t2455> <t2456>I haven't gone anywhere.</t2456> <t2457>Where would I go?</t2457><t2458>”</t2458>
<t2459>“Hey, look at the bull, boss, something strange is happening.</t2459> <t2460>Am I me, or who am I?</t2460> <t2461>Am I in the bull, if not in the bull, where am I?</t2461> <t2462>This is what I need to know.</t2462><t2463>”</t2463>
<t2464>"I think it's quite clear that you are here, but I must add that you are a completely confused fool, Jim."</t2464><t2465></t2465>
<t2466>“I am, right?</t2466> <t2467>Okay, answer this: You took the rope and paddled away with the canoe, tied the canoe to a shallow spot, right?</t2467><t2468>”</t2468>
<t2469>“There is no such thing.</t2469> <t2470>What shallowness?</t2470> <t2471>I didn't see any shallowness.</t2471><t2472>”</t2472>
<t2473>“So, you didn't hit any shallows?</t2473> <t2474>Look at the ox, when the rope snapped, it went down the river, and didn't you get stuck in the fog with the canoe?</t2474><t2475>”</t2475>
<t2476>“Is it us, really?</t2476><t2477>”</t2477>
<t2478>“Here is the fog.</t2478> <t2479>The fog that didn't lift all night.</t2479> <t2480>You called out to me, I called out to you, in the end, we got lost between the sandy shore and the islands, and we lost each other, neither of us knew where the other was, so we were lost.</t2480> <t2481>Then I crossed the islands again, had a very difficult time, and almost drowned.</t2481> <t2482>Isn't that right, boss…</t2482> <t2483>ha, isn't that right?</t2483> <t2484>Tell me!</t2484><t2485>”</t2485>
<t2486>“Alright, but they all came more than once, Jim.</t2486> <t2487>I didn't see any fog, I didn't see the islands, and we weren't in any trouble.</t2487> <t2488>We sat here and chatted all night, and you fell asleep ten minutes ago, I think I did the same.</t2488> <t2489>Since you couldn't get drunk in such a short time, I have no doubt you were dreaming.</t2489><t2490>”</t2490>
<t2491>“That can't be?</t2491> <t2492>How did I see that much of a dream in ten minutes?</t2492><t2493>”</t2493>
<t2494>“It doesn't matter, you saw it in your dream, because none of these things happened.</t2494><t2495>”</t2495>
<t2496>"But Huck, it's all so muddled in my head..."</t2496><t2497>"</t2497>
<t2498>“But what difference does it make if it's clear, it has nothing to do with reality.</t2498> <t2499>I'm sure of it, because I've always been here.</t2499><t2500>”</t2500>
<t2501>Jim didn't say anything for five minutes, he was trying to put the pieces together in his mind.</t2501>
<t2502>“So it seems I supposedly died, Huck,” he said finally.</t2502> <t2503>“If I didn't die the bloodiest and liveliest supposed death, I'm not a man.</t2503> <t2504>Also, no other supposed death has ever worn me out this much.</t2504><t2505>”</t2505>
<t2506>“Alright dear, such things happen; sometimes dreams can also tire a person.</t2506> <t2507>But this time it was a wonderful dream...</t2507> <t2508>Tell me all about it, Jim.</t2508><t2509>”</t2509>
<t2510>Jim started right away and told everything as it was from beginning to end, but he embellished it quite a bit.</t2510> <t2511>Then he said he needed to start interpreting the dream, because the dream was a warning.</t2511> <t2512>The first islet was someone who would try to do us good, but the current was another man who would pull us away from him.</t2512> <t2513>The calls were a warning of what could happen to us at any moment, and if we didn't try hard to understand them, they would bring us bad luck instead of protecting us from it.</t2513> <t2514>A lot of sandbars meant we would get into trouble with quarrelsome people and all sorts of lowly individuals; but if we minded our own business and didn't respond or provoke them, we would get away and escape the fog, reaching the big clear river which was the free states.</t2514> <t2515>Then we would have no more troubles at all.</t2515>
<t2516>After I got on the bus, the weather had become cloudy and it had gotten quite dark around, but now the clouds were dispersing.</t2516>
<t2517>“Alright, you interpreted it very well, Jim,” I said.</t2517> <t2518>“Okay, but what do these mean; can you tell me?</t2518><t2519>”</t2519>
<t2520>I was pointing out the leaves, debris, and broken oar on the raft.</t2520> <t2521>Now everything was clearly visible.</t2521>
<t2522>Jim looked at them, then at me, then back at them again.</t2522> <t2523>He was so convinced he was dreaming that he couldn't shake off the idea, unable to put the facts back in place.</t2523> <t2524>But then, when he had everything sorted out in his mind, he looked at me straight without a smile.</t2524>
<t2525>“What does it mean?</t2525> <t2526>I'll tell you.</t2526> <t2527>Calling out and looking for you on Tuesday exhausted me, I was devastated because you were lost.</t2527> <t2528>I no longer cared about myself or the search.</t2528> <t2529>When I finally woke up and saw you safe and sound, my eyes filled with tears, I was so grateful that I was ready to kneel and kiss your feet.</t2529> <t2530>But your only thought was to lie to poor Jim and deceive him.</t2530> <t2531>This is the wreckage of your game; wreckage is what you call someone who plays dirty tricks on their friend, making them ashamed.</t2531><t2532>”</t2532>
<t2533>Then, slowly, he got up and went into the shelter.</t2533> <t2534>He didn't say anything else.</t2534> <t2535>But that was enough anyway.</t2535> <t2536>I was so ashamed and regretful that I could have fallen at his feet at that moment to take back what I had done.</t2536>
<t2537>It took me about fifteen minutes to convince myself to humble myself to win the favor of a black man – but in the end, I did it and I never regretted it.</t2537> <t2538>I never played such mean tricks on him again, and if I had known he would feel this way, I wouldn't have done such things the first time either.</t2538>
<t2539>Chapter Six</t2539>
<t2540>We slept almost all day and set out again at night; we were following a long and huge raft like a ceremonial procession.</t2540> <t2541>There were four long oars at each end of the raft, so we estimated that there were about thirty people on it.</t2541> <t2542>There were five separate shelters spaced apart on the raft, and we also saw an open campfire in the middle and a long flagpole at each end.</t2542> <t2543>This raft looked quite majestic.</t2543> <t2544>Working on such a watercraft must have been something to be proud of.</t2544>
<t2545>We started to navigate around a big bend, the weather became cloudy and it started to warm up.</t2545> <t2546>The river was very wide and dense trees on both banks formed almost a wall; you couldn't see a single open spot or light.</t2546> <t2547>We started talking about Cairo and pondered how we would know when we arrived there.</t2547> <t2548>Most likely, we wouldn't realize when we got there, because I had heard that there were only about a dozen houses there, and if their lights weren't on as we passed by, how would we know we had passed through a town?</t2548> <t2549>Jim said we would know when we got there because two large rivers converged there.</t2549> <t2550>But I replied that we might think we had just passed the tip of an island and continued on the same river.</t2550> <t2551>Upon this, Jim started to waver... and so did I.</t2551> <t2552>So what would we do then?</t2552> <t2553>I said I would go ashore with the canoe at the first place we saw lights, and tell the people there that my father was coming behind us with a freight boat, and since he was new to this, he wanted to know how far Cairo was.</t2553> <t2554>Jim liked this idea, we lit our pipes and started to wait.</t2554>
<t2555>Now all we had to do was keep our eyes wide open and spring into action when we saw a town.</t2555> <t2556>Jim said that when we got near a town, he would definitely see it, because the moment he saw the town, he would be a free man, but if he missed it, he would still be in the land of the blacks and would not reach freedom.</t2556> <t2557>He often jumped up and said, "There it is!"</t2557>
<t2558>But she was mistaken.</t2558> <t2559>The lights she saw turned out to be either swamp fire or fireflies; then she would sit back down and continue watching with her eyes wide open just like before.</t2559> <t2560>Jim said that being so close to freedom made him tremble violently and his heart start to beat rapidly.</t2560> <t2561>I must say that listening to him also made me tremble violently and my heart beat rapidly, because it was beginning to dawn on me that he would indeed soon taste freedom – and who was to blame for that?</t2561> <t2562>It was me.</t2562> <t2563>No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't silence my conscience.</t2563> <t2564>I was so restless that I couldn't relax at all, I couldn't stay still.</t2564> <t2565>I had never felt the meaning of what I was doing so deeply before.</t2565> <t2566>But now I felt it; moreover, it had settled inside me and was burning my heart more and more.</t2566> <t2567>I tried to convince myself that it wasn't my fault, because I wasn't the one who helped Jim escape from his owner; but it was no use, because my conscience would stand up each time and say: “But you knew he wanted to be free and you could have gone ashore and told someone.”</t2567> <t2568>This was true – no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't deny it.</t2568> <t2569>And that was what hurt the most.</t2569> <t2570>My conscience kept asking the same questions: “What did poor Miss Watson ever do to you that you watch her slave escape right before your eyes and don't say a word?</t2570> <t2571>What wrong did the poor woman do to you that you do such a despicable thing to her?</t2571> <t2572>She tried to teach you the book, she tried to teach you manners, she tried to do good to you in her own way.</t2572> <t2573>She has no other fault.</t2573><t2574>”</t2574>
<t2575>I felt so vile and despicable that I wished God would take my life and save me from this misery.</t2575> <t2576>While I was pacing back and forth on the raft, blaming myself in distress, I kept running into Jim, who was pacing just like me.</t2576> <t2577>Neither of us could stay still.</t2577> <t2578>Every time Jim started to dance with joy, saying, "There's Cairo!" I felt like I had been struck in the head, and if that really was Cairo, I thought I would die from my torment.</t2578>
<t2579>While I was keeping everything to myself, Jim was openly expressing all his thoughts.</t2579> <t2580>He said that his first task upon reaching one of the free states would be to start saving money.</t2580> <t2581>With the money he saved without spending a single cent, he would first buy his wife.</t2581> <t2582>Jim’s wife belonged to a farmer living near Mrs. Watson’s house.</t2582> <t2583>Then, working together, they would buy their two children; if the owners were unwilling to sell the children, they would pay some abolitionists to steal them.</t2583>
<t2584>Hearing him talk like that chilled my blood.</t2584> <t2585>He would never have dared to say such things before.</t2585> <t2586>How much he had changed the moment he felt he was approaching freedom.</t2586> <t2587>Just like the old saying goes, "give a Negro your hand and he'll take your arm."</t2587> <t2588>This is the result of thoughtlessness, I was saying to myself.</t2588> <t2589>Here was the Negro I almost helped escape, now openly talking about committing a new crime by stealing children, and not just any children, but those of a man I didn't know and who had never done me any harm.</t2589>
<t2590>Jim saying such things was upsetting me greatly, he had fallen from my favor.</t2590> <t2591>My conscience started to ache so much that I finally gave in and said to myself: "This is enough...</t2591> <t2592>it's not too late yet...</t2592> <t2593>I'll go ashore at first light and report him."</t2593> <t2594>Suddenly, I felt relieved, cheerful, as light as a feather.</t2594> <t2595>It was as if all my troubles had ended.</t2595> <t2596>I started scanning the shore with wide eyes to see if there was any light and began to hum a tune to myself.</t2596> <t2597>After a while, the first light appeared.</t2597> <t2598>Jim was shouting:</t2598>
<t2599>"We're safe, Huck, we made it!</t2599> <t2600>Come on, hey, we finally reached Cairo.</t2600> <t2601>This time I have no doubt!</t2601><t2602>"</t2602>
<t2603>"Let me go and take a look, Jim.</t2603> <t2604>Maybe it's not the place;" I said.</t2604>
<t2605>Jim jumped up, went to prepare the canoe, spread his old jacket inside for me to sit on, and handed me the paddle.</t2605> <t2606>As I was moving away, he called out after me:</t2606>
<t2607>“Soon I will jump for joy and say it’s all thanks to Huck.</t2607> <t2608>Now I am a free man and I couldn’t have made it without Huck; I owe everything to Huck.</t2608> <t2609>Jim will never forget you, Huck; you are Jim’s best friend ever, and now you are poor Jim’s only friend.</t2609><t2610>”</t2610>
<t2611>I was rowing with all my might to report him as soon as possible, but when I heard these things, I suddenly became paralyzed.</t2611> <t2612>I gradually slowed down; I was no longer so sure if I was pleased with having embarked on this task.</t2612> <t2613>When I was about fifty meters away, Jim called out again:</t2613>
<t2614>“Come on, put some strength in your arm, my friend Huck, the only white master who kept his promise to poor Jim.</t2614><t2615>”</t2615>
<t2616>No, my stomach couldn't handle this tattling.</t2616> <t2617>But still, I thought, I must do it, I couldn't back out anymore.</t2617> <t2618>Just then, a boat appeared, with two men holding rifles inside.</t2618> <t2619>When they saw me, they stopped; I also stopped.</t2619>
<t2620>"What's that over there?" someone asked.</t2620>
<t2621>“Give me a ride,” I said.</t2621>
<t2622>"Are you coming from the hall?</t2622><t2623>"</t2623>
<t2624>“Yes, sir!</t2624><t2625>”</t2625>
<t2626>“Is there another man?</t2626><t2627>”</t2627>
<t2628>“There is one more man; sir.</t2628><t2629>”</t2629>
<t2630>“Tonight, five black men escaped just above the bend.</t2630> <t2631>Is the man on the raft white or black?</t2631><t2632>”</t2632>
<t2633>I couldn't respond immediately.</t2633> <t2634>I tried, but the words just wouldn't come to mind.</t2634> <t2635>For a few seconds, I tried to pull myself together, but I couldn't act like a man; it was as if I had the heart of a rabbit.</t2635> <t2636>I felt myself losing more and more, and finally, I stopped trying and responded...</t2636>
<t2637>“White.</t2637><t2638>”</t2638>
<t2639>“I guess it would be better if we go and check ourselves.</t2639><t2640>”</t2640>
<t2641>“That would be great; because the man over there is my father.</t2641> <t2642>Maybe you could help me move the boat to where the light is.</t2642> <t2643>My father is a bit unwell…</t2643> <t2644>so are my mother and Mary Ann.</t2644><t2645>”</t2645>
<t2646>“Hey, you devil!</t2646> <t2647>We're in a hurry, kid.</t2647> <t2648>But it would still be good to help you.</t2648> <t2649>Come on, turn back so we can get to work.</t2649><t2650>”</t2650>
<t2651>As I turned back, they also started rowing.</t2651> <t2652>After moving forward a bit, I started again:</t2652>
<t2653>“My father will be grateful to you.</t2653> <t2654>Everyone I asked for help to pull the boat ashore on Tuesday is running away, and I am not strong enough to do this job alone.</t2654><t2655>”</t2655>
<t2656>"The world is full of scoundrels, my child.</t2656> <t2657>But it's strange, really.</t2657> <t2658>Tell me, what is wrong with your father?</t2658><t2659>"</t2659>
<t2660>“Uh… well, there's not much actually.</t2660><t2661>”</t2661>
<t2662>They stopped rowing.</t2662> <t2663>We had very little distance left to the raft.</t2663> <t2664>One of them looked at me with a frown.</t2664>
<t2665>"Don't lie, my son.</t2665> <t2666>What's wrong with your father?</t2666> <t2667>It will be better for you if you give me the correct answer.</t2667><t2668>"</t2668>
<t2669>“I swear to tell the truth, sir...</t2669> <t2670>but please, don't go.</t2670> <t2671>His illness...</t2671> <t2672>and if you just pull from the front, that's enough, I'll hand you the rope and you won't need to approach the boat... please.</t2672><t2673>”</t2673>
<t2674>“Back off, John, back off!” said the other.</t2674> <t2675>They started rowing backwards.</t2675> <t2676>“Stay away, kid… stay behind.</t2676> <t2677>Damn it, it must have reached us with the breeze.</t2677> <t2678>Your father has come down with smallpox and you know it very well.</t2678> <t2679>Why didn't you say it from the beginning?</t2679> <t2680>Do you want everyone to get infected?</t2680><t2681>”</t2681>
<t2682>I started to stutter.</t2682> <t2683>"I... I... I told the ones before you, but they left immediately.</t2683><t2684>"</t2684>
<t2685>“Oh poor thing, it's not your fault either.</t2685> <t2686>We felt very sorry for your situation, but we…</t2686> <t2687>damn it, we don't want to catch smallpox, kid.</t2687> <t2688>Now let me tell you what to do.</t2688> <t2689>Don't try to pull the raft ashore by yourself, or you'll tear it to pieces.</t2689> <t2690>After going about twenty miles, you'll see a town on the left side of the river.</t2690> <t2691>By then, it will probably be noon.</t2691> <t2692>Also, when asking for help, just say that your folks are shivering and have a fever.</t2692> <t2693>This time, don't be foolish and let people guess what the illness is themselves.</t2693> <t2694>We're trying to do you a favor, kid.</t2694> <t2695>Listen to us and get at least twenty miles away from us.</t2695> <t2696>There's no point in landing where the light is…</t2696> <t2697>it's just a lumberyard.</t2697> <t2698>Your father must be a poor man…</t2698> <t2699>and it seems he hasn't had any luck either.</t2699> <t2700>I'm putting twenty dollars in gold on this board, you can take it once you're away from us.</t2700> <t2701>It's very cruel to leave you on your own, but for God's sake! Smallpox is no joke, child.</t2701><t2702>”</t2702>
<t2703>"Wait a moment, Parker," said the other man.</t2703> <t2704>"Put a twenty on the board from me too.</t2704> <t2705>Goodbye, my dear, if you listen to Mr. Parker, everything will be fine.</t2705><t2706>"</t2706>
<t2707>"Yes, son... stay safe, stay safe.</t2707> <t2708>If you see runaway black people, call for help and have them caught, you can also make money this way.</t2708><t2709>"</t2709>
<t2710>“Goodbye, gentlemen,” I said.</t2710> <t2711>“If I have the strength, I will not let any black person pass.</t2711><t2712>”</t2712>
<t2713>The men left, and I jumped into the skiff; I was feeling terrible because I knew very well that what I had done was wrong, and I realized that trying to learn to do the right thing was in vain; a person who hasn't been well-mannered and hasn't learned the ways when young, no matter how much they try, it's futile.</t2713> <t2714>When it comes down to it, they are doomed to failure because they have nothing to rely on or to help them persevere.</t2714> <t2715>Then I thought a little, wait a minute, I said to myself, let's say you did the right thing and turned Jim in, would you feel better than you do now?</t2715> <t2716>No, I said, I would feel bad – just as I feel bad now.</t2716> <t2717>So what's the use of learning to do the right thing?</t2717> <t2718>Doing the right thing gets you into trouble; when you do the wrong thing, no one gets hurt, and in both cases, you feel bad.</t2718> <t2719>When I got to this point, I was stuck.</t2719> <t2720>I had no answer to give.</t2720> <t2721>So I decided not to worry about this matter anymore and to do whatever seemed most appropriate at the time when the moment came.</t2721>
<t2722>I entered the shelter, Jim was not there.</t2722> <t2723>I looked everywhere, he was nowhere to be found.</t2723> <t2724>I called out:</t2724>
<t2725>“Jim!</t2725><t2726>”</t2726>
<t2727>“I'm here, Huck.</t2727> <t2728>Did he get far enough away?</t2728> <t2729>Don't raise your voice, though!</t2729><t2730>”</t2730>
<t2731>He was in the river, had gone under the rudder oar, and only his nose was above the water.</t2731> <t2732>I told him that the men had disappeared from sight, and he got onto the raft.</t2732>
<t2733>“I heard everything you said,” said Jim.</t2733> <t2734>“I immediately dove into the river without hesitation and made a plan: If they went up to the deck, I would secretly swim to the shore.</t2734> <t2735>When they left, I swam back to the raft again.</t2735> <t2736>How cleverly you tricked them, Huck! I have never seen a more cunning act than this until today! Poor Jim was saved by your cleverness.</t2736> <t2737>Big Jim will never forget this, my heart’s corner.</t2737><t2738>”</t2738>
<t2739>Then we talked about the money issue.</t2739> <t2740>We had twenty dollars each.</t2740> <t2741>Jim said we could now buy a ticket on a steamboat, and it would be more than enough for both of us until we reached the free states.</t2741> <t2742>Going another twenty miles by raft wasn't much, but Jim wanted to be there as soon as possible.</t2742>
<t2743>When morning came, we tied the raft to a place, and Jim worked hard this time to hide the raft well.</t2743> <t2744>Then he spent the whole day organizing our belongings into bundles.</t2744>
<t2745>We moved towards the lights we saw around ten in the evening where the river bends on the left side.</t2745>
<t2746>I left the raft with the canoe to ask for directions.</t2746> <t2747>Soon, I encountered a man casting a fishing line into the river from his boat.</t2747> <t2748>I approached and called out:</t2748>
<t2749>"Is this Cairo, sir?"</t2749><t2750>"</t2750>
<t2751>“Is it Cairo?</t2751> <t2752>No way.</t2752> <t2753>Are you stupid or what!</t2753><t2754>”</t2754>
<t2755>"Which town is this, sir?"</t2755><t2756></t2756>
<t2757>"If you're so curious, go and see for yourself.</t2757> <t2758>But if you keep nagging me, things you won't like at all will happen to you.</t2758><t2759>"</t2759>
<t2760>I returned to the room.</t2760> <t2761>Jim was very disappointed, but I told him not to dwell on it; Cairo was probably the next town.</t2761>
<t2762>We passed another town before sunrise, but I didn't go there because it was a high place.</t2762> <t2763>Jim reminded me that there were no steep places around Cairo.</t2763> <t2764>However, I had forgotten that.</t2764> <t2765>We spent the daylight hours on a small island that could be considered close to the left shore.</t2765> <t2766>A possibility started to come to my mind.</t2766> <t2767>Jim was also getting suspicious.</t2767>
<t2768>“Maybe we passed Cairo on that foggy night,” I said.</t2768>
<t2769>“Don’t say such things, Huck.</t2769> <t2770>The poor black man never had any luck anyway.</t2770> <t2771>I was also afraid that touching the rattlesnake skin would continue to bring us bad luck.</t2771><t2772>”</t2772>
<t2773>"I wish I had never seen that snake skin, Jim...</t2773> <t2774>I wish it had never caught my eye.</t2774><t2775>"</t2775>
<t2776>“It’s not your fault, Huck; how could you have known.</t2776> <t2777>Don’t blame yourself for this.</t2777><t2778>”</t2778>
<t2779>When the sun rose, we clearly saw the clear Ohio water flowing from the shore, while farther out, the muddy water we knew was flowing!</t2779> <t2780>So, there was nothing left to argue about regarding Cairo.</t2780>
<t2781>We started talking to find a way.</t2781> <t2782>There was no point in approaching the shore; we certainly weren't going to take the raft against the current.</t2782> <t2783>We had no choice but to wait for darkness to fall and try our luck with the canoe.</t2783> <t2784>So we slept all day among the dense trees to gather energy, but when we returned to the raft as it got dark, we saw that the canoe had vanished without a trace!</t2784>
<t2785>For a long time, neither of us could utter a word.</t2785> <t2786>We had nothing to say.</t2786> <t2787>We knew this was one of the misfortunes brought by the rattlesnake skin; so what was there to say?</t2787> <t2788>It would seem as if we were blaming it, and this would bring even more misfortune – until we finally shut our mouths, misfortune would not leave us alone.</t2788>
<t2789>After a while, we started discussing what to do and decided that we had no choice but to continue on the raft until we found a place to buy a canoe to return.</t2789> <t2790>We wouldn't borrow one when no one was around, as my father would, because we couldn't risk people coming after us.</t2790>
<t2791>When darkness fell, we untied the rope and set off on our way.</t2791>
<t2792>If there is anyone who does not believe that touching a snake's skin is foolish, they will believe it when they see what the snake's skin has done to us; especially if they continue reading and learn what else has happened to us, they may choose not to believe it.</t2792>
<t2793>In the shores where rafts are pulled ashore, canoes for sale are usually found as well.</t2793> <t2794>But since we couldn't see any rafts pulled ashore, we continued on our way for another three hours.</t2794> <t2795>Meanwhile, gray and dense clouds covered the night sky, which was probably the worst thing after the fog.</t2795> <t2796>One couldn't calculate the shape of the river, nor could they see their surroundings.</t2796> <t2797>It was very late and there was no sound at all, then we noticed a steamboat coming directly towards us from upstream.</t2797> <t2798>We immediately lit our lantern so that they could see us.</t2798> <t2799>Boats going upstream usually don't come close to us; they follow the shallows; they prefer the calm waters beneath the reefs.</t2799> <t2800>However, on foggy nights like this, they go straight up the river; they don't stop for anything.</t2800>
<t2801>We could hear the sound of the ship, but we didn't see it until it got really close.</t2801> <t2802>It was coming straight at us.</t2802> <t2803>They often do this and want to show how close they can pass without hitting; sometimes they hit the edge of the boat and the helmsman sticks his head out and laughs; he thinks he's very clever.</t2803> <t2804>Here it was coming, we thought it would just graze us, but it seemed like it wouldn't change its course even a little.</t2804> <t2805>It was a big steamer, coming fast; it looked like a huge cloud surrounded by fireflies; then suddenly it was upon us, with its wide-open furnace mouths glowing like red-hot teeth, its massive prow and stanchions above our heads, it was enormous and terrifying.</t2805> <t2806>I heard someone shouting at us, bells rang to stop the engine, I heard the hiss of steam; but it was too late, as Jim jumped to one side and I to the other in a desperate attempt to escape, the ship struck the boat right in the middle.</t2806>
<t2807>I dived – I even wanted to go all the way to the bottom, because the 10-meter diameter wheel was going to pass over me and I needed to make room for it.</t2807> <t2808>Normally, I can stay underwater for about a minute, but I think this time I stayed for almost a minute and a half.</t2808> <t2809>Then I surfaced with all my speed, because my lungs were about to burst.</t2809> <t2810>I almost rose up to my armpits and blew out the water that had filled my nose, then took deep breaths.</t2810> <t2811>There was a tremendous, roaring current, and moreover, the ship started its engines again ten seconds later, because they never care about the raftsmen; the ferry was once again moving upstream, spewing foam, disappearing into the mist, but I could still hear its sound.</t2811>
<t2812>I called out to Jim at least ten times, but there was no response.</t2812> <t2813>While struggling in the water, I grabbed hold of a plank that came into my hand and, holding it in front of me, kicked my feet to swim towards the shore.</t2813> <t2814>But then I realized that the current was pushing me towards the left shore, which meant I had reached one of the junctions, so I changed my course and went to the left.</t2814>
<t2815>This was a long, sloping, two-mile junction point; that's why it took me quite a long time to reach the shore.</t2815> <t2816>I safely set foot on land and started climbing up from the shore.</t2816> <t2817>I could hardly see ahead; I advanced about a quarter mile by feeling my way through the rugged terrain and finally found myself in front of a large, old-fashioned, two-winged wooden house.</t2817> <t2818>I was about to change my path and move away immediately, but when a bunch of dogs came barking and surrounded me, I realized that the smartest thing to do was not to move at all.</t2818>
<t2819>Chapter Seventeen</t2819>
<t2820>Before half a minute had passed, someone called out from a window without showing their head:</t2820>
<t2821>“Alright, that's enough children!</t2821> <t2822>Who is there?</t2822><t2823>”</t2823>
<t2824>“It's mine.</t2824><t2825>”</t2825>
<t2826>“Who are you?</t2826><t2827>”</t2827>
<t2828>“Mr. George Jackson.”</t2828><t2829>”</t2829>
<t2830>“What do you want?</t2830><t2831>”</t2831>
<t2832>"I don't want anything, sir.</t2832> <t2833>I just want to go on my way, but the dogs won't let me.</t2833><t2834>"</t2834>
<t2835>“Why are you sneaking around my house in the middle of the night?”</t2835><t2836>”</t2836>
<t2837>“I wasn't walking, sir; I fell into the water from the deck of a steamship.</t2837><t2838>”</t2838>
<t2839>“Did you fall into the water?</t2839> <t2840>Turn on a light.</t2840> <t2841>What was your name?</t2841><t2842>”</t2842>
<t2843>"Mr. George Jackson."</t2843> <t2844>"I am just a child."</t2844><t2845>"</t2845>
<t2846>“If you are telling the truth, you have nothing to fear…</t2846> <t2847>No one will harm you.</t2847> <t2848>But don’t even think about moving from your spot, stay where you are.</t2848> <t2849>One of you lift Bob and Tom, and one of you bring the rifles.</t2849> <t2850>Is there anyone with you, George Jackson?</t2850><t2851>”</t2851>
<t2852>“No, sir, there is no one.</t2852><t2853>”</t2853>
<t2854>I heard people moving inside the house, a light turned on.</t2854> <t2855>The man's anxious voice was heard:</t2855>
<t2856>“Move that light away quickly, Betsy, you fool...</t2856> <t2857>Have you lost all your sense?</t2857> <t2858>Leave it on the ground behind the front door.</t2858> <t2859>Bob, you and Tom take your positions if you're ready.</t2859><t2860>”</t2860>
<t2861>“We are all ready.</t2861><t2862>”</t2862>
<t2863>“Tell me, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdsons?</t2863><t2864>”</t2864>
<t2865>“No; sir.</t2865> <t2866>I've never heard of it.</t2866><t2867>”</t2867>
<t2868>“Alright, maybe you're telling the truth, maybe you're not.</t2868> <t2869>Yes, everyone is ready.</t2869> <t2870>Come closer, George Jackson.</t2870> <t2871>But don't move quickly…</t2871> <t2872>Come very slowly.</t2872> <t2873>If there's someone with you, they should stay back; if they show themselves, they'll be shot.</t2873> <t2874>Come on then.</t2874> <t2875>Be slow; open the door carefully…</t2875> <t2876>But only open it enough for you to pass through, do you hear me?</t2876><t2877>”</t2877>
<t2878>I never hurried, and even if I wanted to, I couldn't have.</t2878> <t2879>As I took each step, I heard nothing but the beating of my own heart.</t2879> <t2880>The dogs had become as quiet as the people and were following me right behind.</t2880> <t2881>When I reached the three-step ladder made of logs, I heard the locks opening and the bolts being drawn inside.</t2881> <t2882>Then I started to slowly push the door with my hand.</t2882> <t2883>“Okay, that's enough,” said someone from inside, “stick your head in.”</t2883> <t2884>I did as he said, but I was thinking they would probably behead me now.</t2884>
<t2885>In the light of the candle on the ground, I saw them all; for a quarter of a minute, they looked at me, and I looked at them.</t2885> <t2886>The three hulking men who had their guns pointed at me were truly intimidating; the oldest one looked to be in his sixties and had gray hair, the other two were in their thirties or a bit older – all of them were healthy and handsome – there was also a gray-haired woman with a sweet gaze and two young girls whom I couldn't see very well in the back.</t2886>
<t2887>"Alright, no problem.</t2887> <t2888>Come inside," said the old man.</t2888>
<t2889>As soon as I entered, the elderly gentleman locked and bolted the door, then told the young men to approach with their rifles.</t2889> <t2890>In the large room with a brand-new carpet laid on the floor, everyone gathered in the corner outside the range of the front windows – there were no windows on the side wall.</t2890> <t2891>They brought the candle closer and examined me from head to toe.</t2891> <t2892>Then they all started talking at once: "No, not a Shepherdson...</t2892> <t2893>No; doesn't look like a Shepherdson at all."</t2893> <t2894>Then the old man said he hoped I wouldn't mind being searched for weapons, as he had no ill intentions...</t2894> <t2895>He just wanted to be sure.</t2895> <t2896>So he didn't put his hand in my pockets, he just felt from the outside and said it was fine.</t2896> <t2897>He told me to relax and consider myself at home; then he asked me to tell everything about myself, but the old woman interrupted:</t2897>
<t2898>"For God's sake, Saul, don't you see the poor thing is soaking wet?</t2898> <t2899>Maybe he's hungry too.</t2899><t2900>"</t2900>
<t2901>“You are right, Rachel, I forgot.</t2901><t2902>”</t2902>
<t2903>Upon this, the elderly lady said:</t2903>
<t2904>“Betsy (he was addressing the black woman), run quickly and bring him something to eat, poor thing; girls, one of you go and wake Buck and tell him that…”</t2904> <t2905>“Ah, here he comes already.”</t2905> <t2906>“Buck, take this little stranger; take off his wet clothes and give him some of your dry ones.”</t2906><t2907>”</t2907>
<t2908>Buck looked to be around my age – either thirteen or fourteen, but he was a bit bigger than me.</t2908> <t2909>He had come with just a shirt on and still seemed like he hadn't fully woken up.</t2909> <t2910>He was yawning on one hand; on the other, he was rubbing his eyes with his fist.</t2910> <t2911>In his other hand, he had a rifle.</t2911>
<t2912>“Aren't they the Shepherdsons?” he asked.</t2912>
<t2913>No, false alarm, they said.</t2913>
<t2914>"If they had come, I would have at least taken one of them down, I guess," he said.</t2914>
<t2915>They all laughed out loud.</t2915>
<t2916>“They probably would have scalped all of us by now, Buck,” said Bob.</t2916> <t2917>“You are coming so slowly.</t2917><t2918>”</t2918>
<t2919>“But no one lifted me up, this is unfair.</t2919> <t2920>You always leave me behind.</t2920> <t2921>You don't give me a chance to show myself.</t2921><t2922>”</t2922>
<t2923>“Don't worry, Buck,” said the old man.</t2923> <t2924>“In time, you will have plenty of opportunities to prove yourself.</t2924> <t2925>Don't be upset about this.</t2925> <t2926>Come on now, do what your mother says.</t2926><t2927>”</t2927>
<t2928>When we went up to Buck's room, he gave me a thick shirt, a short jacket, and pants.</t2928> <t2929>While I was getting dressed, he asked my name, but before I had a chance to tell him, he started talking about the blue jay and the baby rabbit he had caught in the forest the day before yesterday.</t2929> <t2930>Then, when the candle went out, he asked where Moses was.</t2930> <t2931>I said I didn't know; I had really never heard anything about it before.</t2931>
<t2932>"Then guess," he said.</t2932>
<t2933>“How should I guess, man?” I said.</t2933> <t2934>“This is the first time in my life I'm hearing about this.</t2934><t2935>”</t2935>
<t2936>“But you can throw something, right?</t2936> <t2937>It's very easy.</t2937><t2938>”</t2938>
<t2939>“Which candle?” I said.</t2939>
<t2940>“It doesn't matter, just any candle.</t2940><t2941>”</t2941>
<t2942>“But I don't know where it is,” I said; “where was it?</t2942><t2943>”</t2943>
<t2944>“Of course, it was in the dark!</t2944> <t2945>It was in the dark, indeed!</t2945><t2946>”</t2946>
<t2947>“If you know where it is, why did you ask me?</t2947><t2948>”</t2948>
<t2949>“Don't drive me crazy, man, I asked you a riddle, didn't you understand?</t2949> <t2950>How long are you going to stay here?</t2950> <t2951>I think you shouldn't leave at all.</t2951> <t2952>We would have a great time...</t2952> <t2953>There's no school these days anyway.</t2953> <t2954>Do you have a dog?</t2954> <t2955>I have one...</t2955> <t2956>It fetches the sticks you throw into the river just like that.</t2956> <t2957>Do you like combing your hair and doing other silly things on Sundays?</t2957> <t2958>I'm sure you don't; but my mom makes me do it.</t2958> <t2959>I hate these pants, I have to wear them, but if it were up to me, I wouldn't wear them in this heat.</t2959> <t2960>Okay, are you ready now?</t2960> <t2961>Let's go, bro.</t2961><t2962>”</t2962>
<t2963>Cold cornbread, canned beef, butter, and skimmed milk – they had brought these out for me to eat, and it felt like I had never eaten such a wonderful meal before.</t2963> <t2964>Buck, his mother, and everyone else were smoking corn cob pipes; only the black woman and the two young women who were not around were not smoking.</t2964> <t2965>They were all smoking and chatting, and I was answering them while eating my meal.</t2965> <t2966>The young women were wrapped in blankets, and their loose hair fell down to their waists.</t2966> <t2967>They all asked me questions.</t2967> <t2968>I told them that my father, the rest of my family, and I lived on a small farm in the southernmost part of Arkansas.</t2968> <t2969>My sister Mary Ann had eloped, and we had never heard from her again; Bill had gone to look for them, and we hadn't heard from him either; Tom and Mort had died, and finally, there was no one left but my father and me.</t2969> <t2970>My father had become skin and bones due to all the troubles he had faced; when he died, since the farm did not belong to us, I had set off upriver with the remaining belongings, but I had fallen off the deck at night.</t2970> <t2971>That was the story of how I came here.</t2971> <t2972>They told me I could stay with them as long as I wanted and consider the place my home.</t2972> <t2973>It was almost dawn, everyone went to their rooms, and I lay down next to Buck; when I woke up in the morning, damn it, I realized I had forgotten my new name.</t2973> <t2974>I spent an hour trying to remember it, and finally, when Buck woke up, I said:</t2974>
<t2975>“Buck, can you spell out the letters of your name?</t2975><t2976>”</t2976>
<t2977>“Of course, I can list them,” he said.</t2977>
<t2978>“But I bet you can't spell out the letters of my name,” I said.</t2978>
<t2979>"Not at all, I can list them all at once."</t2979><t2980>"</t2980>
<t2981>"Alright then," I said, "let's see you list them.</t2981><t2982>"</t2982>
<t2983>“G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n…”</t2983> <t2984>“Is that wrong?”</t2984><t2985>”</t2985>
<t2986>“Alright, you got it right, but I never would have guessed.</t2986> <t2987>It's not a name that can be spelled out in one go without any effort.</t2987><t2988>”</t2988>
<t2989>When I was alone, I sat down and started working because someone else might ask me to write my name, and I would need to write it quickly as if I were very accustomed to it.</t2989>
<t2990>They were truly a nice family, and their house was really beautiful.</t2990> <t2991>Until that day, I had never seen such a beautiful and elegant house in the countryside.</t2991> <t2992>There was no iron latch or wooden latch opened with a leather strap on the front door; instead, there was a brass handle like the ones in town houses, which you turned to open.</t2992> <t2993>There was no bed in the living room, not even anything resembling a bed; whereas almost all the living rooms in town had beds.</t2993> <t2994>There was a large hearth with bricks laid at the bottom, and they kept the bricks clean and red by pouring water on them and rubbing them together; sometimes they also dipped the bricks in a red paint called Spanish-coffee, as was done in town.</t2994> <t2995>The brass fittings in the house's fireplace were large enough to hold big logs.</t2995> <t2996>In the middle of the mantelpiece, I saw a clock, and below the glass of the clock's lower half, there was a picture of a town; the empty space in the middle of the clock symbolized the sun, and you could see the pendulum swinging right behind it.</t2996> <t2997>It was very nice to listen to the ticking of this clock; sometimes when one of the traveling repairmen cleaned and reset it, the clock could chime one hundred and fifty times before the spring fully unwound.</t2997> <t2998>Moreover, the repairmen never charged any money for the clock.</t2998>
<t2999>On each side of the clock, there was a showy parrot; made from something like chalk and painted in gaudy colors.</t2999> <t3000>Next to one of the parrots was a clay cat, and next to the other was a clay dog; if you pressed on the cat and dog, they would squeak, but their mouths wouldn't open, their appearance wouldn't change; they wouldn't react.</t3000> <t3001>They squeaked from their undersides.</t3001> <t3002>Behind these items, a pair of large fans made from wild turkey feathers were hanging.</t3002> <t3003>On a table in the middle of the room, there was also a very nice clay basket; filled with apples, oranges; peaches, and grapes that looked much redder, yellower, and more delicious than the real ones, but it was obvious they weren't real because in some places the white chalk or whatever the material was underneath was showing.</t3003>
<t3004>On the beautiful oilcloth cover that was neatly laid on the table, a red and blue eagle with its wings spread was drawn within a colorful frame.</t3004> <t3005>They said this cover came all the way from Philadelphia.</t3005> <t3006>There were also books carefully stacked on each corner of the table.</t3006> <t3007>One of them was a large Holy Bible filled with pictures, suitable for family reading.</t3007> <t3008>Another one was "On the Pilgrimage," about a man who left his home and family for an unspecified reason.</t3008> <t3009>I occasionally picked up this book and read quite a bit of it.</t3009> <t3010>The sentences were interesting but of a kind that was hard to understand.</t3010> <t3011>There was also a book called "The Gifts of Friendship" filled with beautiful writings and poems; but I did not read the poems.</t3011> <t3012>Besides a book titled "Speeches of Henry Clay," there was also Dr. Gunn's "Family Medicine," which explained everything to do if someone gets sick or dies.</t3012> <t3013>There was a Hymn Book and many other books.</t3013> <t3014>We were also sitting on very beautiful woven wicker chairs, and they were very sturdy – not like old baskets with sagging centers and broken bottoms.</t3014>
<t3015>There were paintings hanging on the walls – mostly Washingtons and Lafayettes, wars, Highland Marys, and also "The Signing of the Declaration of Independence".</t3015><t3016>There were also pencil drawings, one of which was made by one of their deceased daughters when she was just fifteen years old.</t3016><t3017>These were different from all the pictures I had seen so far; they were darker in color than all of them.</t3017><t3018>In one of them, there was a woman in a thin black dress.</t3018><t3019>The dress was cinched at the armpits with a belt, the cuffs were puffed up like cabbage, and there was a black veil in front of the shovel-like brimmed hat on her head, black ribbons were tied around her white thin wrists, and she wore small black slippers resembling chisels on her feet.</t3019><t3020>The woman was standing pensively with her right elbow resting on a tombstone, under a weeping willow, and in her other hand hanging by her side, a white handkerchief and a handbag could be seen, and beneath the picture, it said, "Alas, I Shall Never See You Again."</t3020><t3021>In another picture, there was a young woman with her hair beautifully done up in a bun on top of her head, with a comb resembling a chair back attached behind the bun.</t3021><t3022>She was crying, holding a handkerchief to her face with one hand, and in her other hand lay a dead bird with its claws up; beneath this picture, it said, "Alas, I Shall Never Hear Your Sweet Song Again."</t3022><t3023>In another picture, a young lady was looking at the moon through a window, with tears streaming down her cheeks; in one hand, she held an open letter sealed with black, and with the other hand, she was bringing a medallion on a chain to her lips.</t3023><t3024>The inscription beneath this picture read: "Ah, You Are Gone, Alas, You Are Gone." These were probably beautiful pictures, but they weren't quite to my taste; because whenever I felt a bit down, looking at these pictures made me feel even worse.</t3024><t3025>Everyone was very sad about the girl's death because she could have made many more of these pictures, and people realized what they had missed by looking at what she had done.</t3025><t3026>But judging by the tendency in the pictures, she probably had a better time in the cemetery.</t3026><t3027>They said that when she fell ill, she was working on her greatest piece and prayed day and night to stay alive until she finished it, but she never got the chance to complete it.</t3027><t3028>This picture was of a young woman in a long white dress; she was standing ready to jump over the railings of a bridge, her hair let loose, looking at the moon with tears streaming down her face.</t3028><t3029>She had her arms crossed over her chest, her arms extended forward, and she was reaching both towards the moon – she would later erase the other arms, deciding which looked better; but as I said, she died before making a decision, and now they keep this picture at the head of her bed in her room; they hung flowers on the picture on her every birthday.</t3029><t3030>At other times, they covered it with a small curtain.</t3030><t3031>The young woman in the picture had a beautiful and sweet face, but having so many arms made her look a bit like a spider to me.</t3031>
<t3032>While the same young girl was alive, she kept a notebook, pasting old obituaries, accident reports, and articles about enduring suffering with patience from the Presbyterian Observer newspaper into it.</t3032> <t3033>She also wrote poems she made up herself for the articles she pasted.</t3033> <t3034>These were very good poems.</t3034> <t3035>The poem she wrote for a boy named Stephen Dowling Bots, who fell into a well and drowned, was as follows:</t3035>
<t3036>DECEASED STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS'S ROOM</t3036>
<t3037>Has little Stephen fallen ill?</t3037>
<t3038>Is little Stephen dead?</t3038>
<t3039>Have sorrowful hearts been constricted,</t3039>
<t3040>Have the mourners shed tears?</t3040>
<t3041>No; this was not his fate</t3041>
<t3042>Young Stephen Dowling Bots’;</t3042>
<t3043>Perhaps sorrowful hearts burned,</t3043>
<t3044>But it wasn't because of illness.</t3044>
<t3045>It wasn't whooping cough that ravaged his body,</t3045>
<t3046>It was unexpected with a hopeless measles;</t3046>
<t3047>It was not these that overshadowed the blessed name</t3047>
<t3048>With the death of Stephen Dowling Bots.</t3048>
<t3049>Love's torment did not burn</t3049>
<t3050>Oh, curly-headed one with bangs,</t3050>
<t3051>It was not a stomach ache that laid one down on the bed,</t3051>
<t3052>Poor Stephen Dowling Bots.</t3052>
<t3053>None of them.</t3053> <t3054>Listen with tears in your eyes,</t3054>
<t3055>While I was narrating his unfortunate fate.</t3055>
<t3056>Left with an indifferent farewell</t3056>
<t3057>From the bottom of a well, this cruel world.</t3057>
<t3058>Ah, they pulled it out of the well and emptied its contents;</t3058>
<t3059>But alas, it was already too late;</t3059>
<t3060>His soul had already gone to run and play</t3060>
<t3061>To the realm of nobility and goodness.</t3061>
<t3062>If Emmeline Grangerford could write such poetry before she was fourteen, it was hard to imagine what she could write in the future.</t3062><t3063>According to Buck, she could easily make up a poem in one go.</t3063><t3064>She didn't even need to stop and think.</t3064><t3065>He said that if she wrote a line and couldn't find a rhyme, she would immediately erase that line and write another one, and continue like that.</t3065><t3066>Moreover, she wasn't fixated on a single topic; whatever you told her to write about, she could write on that topic, as long as it was sorrowful.</t3066><t3067>Whenever a man, woman, or child died, she would come up with a piece expressing her love and respect for that person before the funeral had even cooled down.</t3067><t3068>According to the neighbors, when someone died, first the doctor, then Emmeline, and then the undertaker would come; the undertaker had only once arrived before Emmeline.</t3068><t3069>As a result, Emmeline, who was shaken by this, had delayed writing for the deceased person named Whistler.</t3069><t3070>After that, the girl was never the same; she never complained, but she wasted away day by day and didn't live much longer.</t3070><t3071>Poor thing; many times when her pictures disturbed me and I started to think of her less, I forced myself to go to the little room that used to be hers, and took out her wretched notebook to read what she had written.</t3071><t3072>I loved everyone in the family, dead or alive, and I wouldn't allow anything to come between us.</t3072><t3073>Poor Emmeline had written poems about all the dead while she was alive, and now that she was gone, it didn't seem right to me that no one would write anything for her; so I tried to write a few verses, but somehow I just couldn't manage it.</t3073><t3074>They always kept Emmeline's room clean and tidy, everything inside was just as she liked it when she was alive, and no one slept in that room.</t3074><t3075>Despite having a lot of black servants, the old woman cleaned the room herself, sewed a lot there, and usually read her Holy Bible there as well.</t3075>
<t3076>Anyway, I was describing the living room.</t3076> <t3077>There were very beautiful curtains on the windows: They were white curtains depicting castles with ivy-covered walls and cattle by the water.</t3077> <t3078>There was also an old small piano in the living room; I think there were pans and such inside it.</t3078> <t3079>Nothing could be as beautiful as the young ladies singing "The Last Ring Broke" and playing the "Battle of Prague" at this piano.</t3079> <t3080>All the walls of the rooms were plastered, most had carpets on the floor, and the exterior of the house was completely painted.</t3080>
<t3081>This was a two-winged house, and a roof was built over the wide open space in between, with a floor underneath.</t3081> <t3082>From time to time, a table was set there for lunch; it was indeed a very cool and comfortable place.</t3082> <t3083>Anything better would be a blessing.</t3083> <t3084>The food was not only very delicious but also plentiful!</t3084>
<t3085>Chapter Eighteen</t3085>
<t3086>Colonel Grangerford was a true nobleman.</t3086><t3087>He was a gentleman from head to toe; the other members of the family were no less.</t3087><t3088>He came from a noble family, and just as with horses, nobility increases the value of people.</t3088><t3089>Mrs. Douglas used to say this, and no one could deny that she was the head of the aristocracy in our town.</t3089><t3090>My father always said the same thing, but he himself was no more noble than a catfish.</t3090><t3091>Colonel Grangerford was very tall and slender, with a dark-pale complexion that showed not the slightest hint of redness.</t3091><t3092>He shaved every part of his thin face every morning; his lips were very thin, his nostrils were very thin, he had a button nose, thick eyebrows, and his jet-black eyes were so deeply set that one almost thought he was looking out of two caves.</t3092><t3093>His forehead was broad, and his black, straight hair reached down to his shoulders.</t3093><t3094>His hands were long and thin; he wore a clean shirt every day and walked around in a snow-white linen suit; the suit was so white it dazzled the eyes.</t3094><t3095>On Sundays, however, he wore a navy blue frock coat with brass buttons.</t3095><t3096>He carried a mahogany cane with a silver knob.</t3096><t3097>There was not a trace of frivolity in his demeanor, not at all; he was never seen raising his voice.</t3097><t3098>A person could not be more kind-hearted – you felt this and trusted him.</t3098><t3099>Sometimes he would smile, and seeing this smile made one feel very good; but sometimes he would stand as erect as a flagpole symbolizing freedom, and glare so fiercely from under his eyebrows that you felt like climbing a tree first and then asking what the matter was.</t3099><t3100>He never needed to remind anyone of manners – everyone behaved politely in his presence.</t3100><t3101>Moreover, everyone enjoyed having him around; he was almost always sunny – that is, you always felt like the weather was nice when he was around.</t3101><t3102>When he clouded over, however, it would be pitch dark for half a minute, and that was enough; no one would do anything wrong for a week.</t3102>
<t3103>When the Colonel and the matron came downstairs in the morning, the whole family would stand up and greet them with a good morning, and they would not sit down until the Colonel and the matron were settled.</t3103> <t3104>Then Tom and Bob would go to the sideboard where the pitcher was, pour a drink made from herbs and roots, and hand it to him. Colonel Grangerford would wait with his hand in the air until Tom and Bob had prepared their own drinks.</t3104> <t3105>Then the young men would bow and say, "Respectfully, sir and madam," to which the elders would respond with a slight nod and a thank you.</t3105> <t3106>Then all three of them would down their drinks.</t3106> <t3107>Afterwards, Bob and Tom would pour a little whiskey or apple brandy over the sugar at the bottom of their glasses, add a spoonful of water, and hand the glasses to Buck and me.</t3107> <t3108>We would drink to the health of the elders.</t3108>
<t3109>The biggest was Bob, and Tom was one size smaller than him.</t3109> <t3110>They were broad-shouldered, dark-faced, tall men; they had long black hair and jet-black eyes.</t3110> <t3111>Just like the big boss, they would dress in white linen from head to toe and wear wide-brimmed straw hats.</t3111>
<t3112>Then came Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five years old, tall, proud, and magnificent, but extremely kind when not provoked; when she was angry, just like her father, she would give such a look that it would make your knees buckle.</t3112> <t3113>She was a beautiful girl.</t3113>
<t3114>Her sister Miss Sophia was also beautiful, but she had a different kind of beauty.</t3114> <t3115>She was gentle and sweet like a dove; she was only twenty.</t3115>
<t3116>Everyone had a black servant who took care of them – Buck had one too.</t3116> <t3117>My black servant had it easy, really, because I wasn't used to having someone else do things for me, whereas Buck's black servant was working hard.</t3117>
<t3118>This was all that was left of the family now; there used to be more – three more sons; but they had been killed and Emmeline had died on her own.</t3118>
<t3119>The old gentleman had many farms and a hundred black slaves.</t3119> <t3120>Sometimes people would come in groups on horseback from ten or fifteen miles away and stay for five or six days; they would have fun around the house and the river, dance, have picnics in the forest during the day, and hold festivities at the house in the evening.</t3120> <t3121>Most of these people were relatives of the family.</t3121> <t3122>The men would bring their rifles with them.</t3122> <t3123>It was quite a distinguished crowd, indeed.</t3123>
<t3124>There was another aristocratic family in the vicinity – they consisted of five or six families, and most of their last names were Shepherdson.</t3124> <t3125>They were also noble, wealthy, and magnificent like the Grangerford clan.</t3125> <t3126>The Shepherdsons and the Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing about two miles upstream from our house; so when I went there with a bunch of our people, I would see a lot of Shepherdsons on their fine horses.</t3126>
<t3127>One day, while Buck and I were hunting in the forest, we heard a horse approaching.</t3127> <t3128>It would pass by the road shortly.</t3128>
<t3129>“Quick, quick! Let's hide behind the trees!” said Buck.</t3129>
<t3130>We immediately hid and started observing the road through the leaves.</t3130> <t3131>Soon, a majestic young man galloping at full speed appeared at the end of the road.</t3131> <t3132>He looked very comfortable on the horse and resembled a soldier.</t3132> <t3133>He had placed his rifle on the saddle horn.</t3133> <t3134>I had seen him before.</t3134> <t3135>It was young Harney Shepherdson.</t3135> <t3136>Buck's rifle went off right next to my ear, and Harney's hat flew off his head.</t3136> <t3137>He immediately grabbed his weapon and headed towards where we were hiding.</t3137> <t3138>But we didn't stop to wait at all.</t3138> <t3139>We immediately started running through the forest.</t3139> <t3140>The forest wasn't very dense, so I kept turning and looking back over my shoulder to dodge the bullets.</t3140> <t3141>Twice I saw Buck right in Harney's line of fire.</t3141> <t3142>Then Harney turned back, probably to get his hat; I couldn't see that part very well.</t3142> <t3143>But we kept running until we reached home.</t3143> <t3144>When he heard what happened, sparks flashed in the old gentleman's eyes – it was essentially out of joy, as far as I could tell – but then his face fell, and he slowly said:</t3144>
<t3145>“I didn't like you shooting from among the trees.</t3145> <t3146>Why didn't you come out directly to the road, my child?</t3146><t3147>”</t3147>
<t3148>"But the Shepherdsons aren't coming out either, father.</t3148> <t3149>They are always laying ambushes for us.</t3149><t3150>"</t3150>
<t3151>As Buck was telling his story, Mrs. Charlotte straightened her neck like a queen; her nostrils flared and her eyes sparkled.</t3151> <t3152>The faces of the two young men fell, but they didn't say a word.</t3152> <t3153>Mrs. Sophia, on the other hand, turned pale for a moment, but then the color returned to her face when she heard that the man was unharmed.</t3153>
<t3154>When we arrived under the trees by the granary, I asked:</t3154>
<t3155>"Did you want to kill him, Buck?"</t3155>
<t3156>“Of course I wanted to.</t3156><t3157>”</t3157>
<t3158>“What did he do to you?</t3158><t3159>”</t3159>
<t3160>“Is it him?</t3160> <t3161>He hadn't done anything to me?</t3161><t3162>”</t3162>
<t3163>“But then why do you want to kill him?</t3163><t3164>”</t3164>
<t3165>"Just... because of a blood feud.</t3165><t3166>"</t3166>
<t3167>“What is a blood feud?</t3167><t3168>”</t3168>
<t3169>"Where did you grow up, my brother?</t3169> <t3170>How do you not know about blood feuds?</t3170><t3171>"</t3171>
<t3172>“I had never heard it before...</t3172> <t3173>Tell me about it.</t3173><t3174>”</t3174>
<t3175>“Alright,” said Buck, “a blood feud is something like this: A man fights with another man, kills him in the fight; then the dead man's brother comes and kills him; then the brothers from both sides start killing each other; then the cousins get involved – in the end, everyone dies and the blood feud ends like that.</t3175> <t3176>But it is a slow thing; it takes a very long time.</t3176><t3177>”</t3177>
<t3178>“So, how long has this blood feud been going on; Buck?</t3178><t3179>”</t3179>
<t3180>“I know as much as they told me!</t3180> <t3181>It started some thirty years ago or so.</t3181> <t3182>When an issue arose, they went to court; the case was decided against one of the men, so he got up and shot the man who won the case – naturally, that's what he would do.</t3182> <t3183>Everyone would do the same.</t3183><t3184>”</t3184>
<t3185>“So what was the issue about, Buck?..</t3185> <t3186>Was it a land matter?</t3186><t3187>”</t3187>
<t3188>“Maybe it is so…</t3188> <t3189>I don't know for sure.</t3189><t3190>”</t3190>
<t3191>“So, who pulled the trigger?</t3191> <t3192>Was it Grangerford or Shepherdson?</t3192><t3193>”</t3193>
<t3194>“Oh come on, how should I know that?</t3194> <t3195>It happened a very long time ago.</t3195><t3196>”</t3196>
<t3197>“Is there anyone who knows?</t3197><t3198>”</t3198>
<t3199>“Yes, my father probably knows, some of the elders surely know; but none of them remember what the initial problem was about.</t3199><t3200>”</t3200>
<t3201>"Were many people killed, Buck?"</t3201>
<t3202>“Yes…</t3202> <t3203>Quite a few funerals have been held, to be honest.</t3203> <t3204>Though it doesn’t always end in death.</t3204> <t3205>My father has a few pellets in his body; but he never minds them, they aren’t very serious anyway.</t3205> <t3206>Bob was stabbed and Tom also has a couple of wounds.</t3206><t3207>”</t3207>
<t3208>"Has anyone been killed this year?"</t3208><t3209></t3209>
<t3210>“Yes, one from us, one from them.</t3210> <t3211>About three months ago, my fourteen-year-old cousin Bud was crossing the forest on the other side of the river on horseback.</t3211> <t3212>The damn fool didn’t even take a weapon with him.</t3212> <t3213>In a desolate place, he heard a horse coming from behind and when he looked back, he realized that old Baldy Shepherdson, with his white hair flying in the wind, was chasing him with a rifle in his hand; instead of dismounting and hiding in the bushes, he spurred his horse, calculating that he could escape; they started going like this, for about five miles, but the old man was getting closer; finally, Bud was desperate and, thinking he might as well take the bullet from the front, stopped and turned his horse around.</t3213> <t3214>The old man caught up with him and shot him from behind.</t3214> <t3215>But he didn’t get a chance to rejoice in his fate, because within a week, our folks took care of him too.</t3215><t3216>”</t3216>
<t3217>“That old man was a coward, Buck.</t3217><t3218>”</t3218>
<t3219>“No, brother, I don't think he was a coward at all.</t3219> <t3220>No one can say that about him.</t3220> <t3221>There are no cowards among the Shepherdsons – not a single one.</t3221> <t3222>There are no cowards among the Grangerfords either.</t3222> <t3223>That old man fought three Grangerfords for half an hour in a skirmish and won.</t3223> <t3224>They were all on horseback; the old man got off his horse and took cover behind a small pile of wood, using his horse as a shield against the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and circled around him, shooting at him, and he fired back.</t3224> <t3225>Both he and his horse returned bleeding and injured, but the Grangerfords had to be carried home on stretchers – one of them was dead and the other died the next day.</t3225> <t3226>No sir, if you're looking for a coward, I say don't waste any time trying to find one among the Shepherdsons, because you'll never find a coward or a weakling among them.</t3226><t3227>”</t3227>
<t3228>Next Sunday, we all rode horses to the church about three miles away.</t3228> <t3229>The men took their rifles with them, and Buck went with his gun too.</t3229> <t3230>They all kept their rifles between their knees or leaned them against the wall nearby.</t3230> <t3231>The Shepherdsons did the same thing.</t3231> <t3232>The sermon was quite ordinary – the preacher kept talking about brotherly love and such, but everyone liked the sermon.</t3232> <t3233>On the way home, the sermon was discussed; everyone had a lot to say about faith, doing good deeds, grace, predestination by God, and many other topics.</t3233> <t3234>It felt like one of the hardest Sundays I had ever spent.</t3234>
<t3235>About an hour after the meal, while some were dozing in their armchairs and others in their rooms, I felt a deep sense of boredom.</t3235> <t3236>Buck and a dog had sprawled out on the grass under the sun and had fallen into a deep sleep.</t3236> <t3237>I decided to go up to our room and take a nap.</t3237> <t3238>I saw sweet Miss Sophia at the door of her room, which was right next to ours; she took me into her room and, after very slowly closing the door, asked if I liked her. Of course, I did; if that was the case, could I do something for her and keep my mouth shut? Of course, I could.</t3238> <t3239>Then she said she had forgotten her Holy Bible, which was left between two other books at the place where she sat in church. She wanted me to go there quietly, retrieve the book, and bring it to her without telling anyone.</t3239> <t3240>I said I would go and get the book.</t3240> <t3241>I slipped out quietly and set off.</t3241> <t3242>There was no one left in the church, only a couple of pigs, because there was no lock on the door and pigs like to lie on the wooden floor in the summer because it's cool.</t3242> <t3243>If you notice, people don't go to church unless they have to, but pigs are not like that.</t3243>
<t3244>I had realized something was going on – it wasn't natural for a girl to get so worked up over a Holy Bible; when I shook the book, a small piece of paper fell out.</t3244> <t3245>On the paper, written in pencil, were the words "half past two."</t3245> <t3246>I thoroughly flipped through the book, but found nothing else.</t3246> <t3247>I didn't understand anything, so I put the paper back into the book; when I reached home and climbed the stairs, I saw Sophia waiting for me at the door.</t3247> <t3248>She immediately pulled me inside and closed the door; then she started flipping through the Holy Bible and was delighted when she found the paper; before I could say anything, she hugged me tightly and said I was the best kid in the world, then reminded me again not to tell anyone.</t3248> <t3249>For a moment, she turned bright red and her eyes sparkled, truthfully, she had become very beautiful.</t3249> <t3250>I was all flustered, but then managed to catch my breath and asked what was written on the paper.</t3250> <t3251>She then asked me if I had read what was written on the paper, I said no, and then she asked if I could read handwriting, I said I could only read newspaper print; she then said there was nothing important on the paper, that she had just put it in the book to keep the page, and that I could go play now.</t3251>
<t3252>As I was thinking about this issue and heading towards the river, I realized that my black man had followed me.</t3252> <t3253>Once the house was out of sight, he looked around for a moment, then ran up to me and said:</t3253>
<t3254>"Master Geooge, you come with me to the swamp, I show you a very poisonous snake."</t3254><t3255>"</t3255>
<t3256>This was very strange, because he had said the same thing yesterday.</t3256> <t3257>He should have understood that I wasn't curious enough about poisonous snakes to go looking for them.</t3257>
<t3258>I wonder what his true intention was?</t3258>
<t3259>“Okay, let's go,” I said.</t3259>
<t3260>I followed him for about half a mile, then we entered the swamp and walked for another half mile through water that reached our ankles.</t3260> <t3261>He led me to a small clearing covered with dry and dense trees and bushes.</t3261>
<t3262>“Just go that way, taking a few steps is enough, Master George, it's all there, I've seen it before, even if I haven't seen it alone.</t3262><t3263>”</t3263>
<t3264>Then he continued on his way and moved away, and a little later he disappeared behind the trees.</t3264> <t3265>When I proceeded to the place he mentioned, I discovered a clearing the size of a bedroom, completely surrounded by bushes and vines, where a man was sleeping – guess who it was, none other than our big Jim!</t3265>
<t3266>When I woke him up, I thought he would be astonished to see me, but that was not the case at all.</t3266> <t3267>He was almost about to cry, he was very happy, but he was definitely not astonished.</t3267> <t3268>That night he told me that he swam behind me and heard me calling, but he didn't respond because he didn't want anyone to rescue him and enslave him again.</t3268>
<t3269>“My throat was a bit sore, so I couldn't swim fast,” he said, “I stayed quite far behind you.</t3269> <t3270>Since you climbed onto the rock, I thought I could catch up to you without calling out, but when I saw that house, I immediately slowed down.</t3270> <t3271>I couldn't hear what they said to you, because I was far away…</t3271> <t3272>and I was also afraid of the dogs…</t3272> <t3273>but eventually the situation calmed down and I realized you had gone into the house.</t3273> <t3274>I waited inside the bushes for the dawn to break.</t3274> <t3275>Some black people were going to the fields early in the morning, they signaled to me and showed me the well.</t3275> <t3276>Because there was water in the well, the dogs couldn't find me; at night, the black people brought me food and told me in detail how you were doing.</t3276><t3277>”</t3277>
<t3278>“Jim, why didn't you tell my nigger Jack to bring me here earlier?” I said.</t3278>
<t3279>"There was no need to bother you, Huck.</t3279> <t3280>We couldn't do anything anyway.</t3280> <t3281>But now things have changed.</t3281> <t3282>Whenever I get the chance, I buy pots, pans, and food, and at night I fix the raft...</t3282><t3283>"</t3283>
<t3284>"Which raft, Jim?"</t3284>
<t3285>"Come here, my little lamb."</t3285><t3286>"</t3286>
<t3287>“No way, I mean didn't our raft break into pieces?</t3287><t3288>”</t3288>
<t3289>“No, it didn't work.</t3289> <t3290>A lot of things broke, one side was very bad, but there wasn't a big damage, just almost all of our belongings are gone.</t3290> <t3291>We dived very deep, then swam very far underwater, also it was very dark that night, we were very scared and a bit foolish, otherwise we would have already been saved.</t3291> <t3292>Actually, it was better that we didn't get saved, the raft is now brand new and we got a lot of new things instead of the ones we lost.</t3292><t3293>”</t3293>
<t3294>“So how did you find the raft again, Jim...</t3294> <t3295>Did you pull it to shore yourself?</t3295><t3296>”</t3296>
<t3297>“There was no need to catch him, he was already in the forest.</t3297> <t3298>A few of the blacks found him stuck in the trees by the bend below, and then they hid him in a cave by the willow grove.</t3298> <t3299>They argued so much about who the raft belonged to that eventually I heard about it, and I decided that the raft didn’t belong to any of them, but to you and me.</t3299> <t3300>I asked them what it meant to take and then hide a white man's property.</t3300> <t3301>Then I gave each of them ten cents, they were all very happy and wished that more rafts would get stuck in the trees, so they could get rich too.</t3301> <t3302>These blacks treated me very well, they didn’t refuse me anything, my dear.</t3302> <t3303>That Jack is also a very good black man, and very smart too.</t3303><t3304>”</t3304>
<t3305>“It really is so.</t3305> <t3306>He didn't even tell me you were here; he just told me to come, that he would show me a bunch of poisonous snakes.</t3306> <t3307>If any trouble arises, he can easily say he had no part in it.</t3307> <t3308>If he says he never saw them together, he wouldn't be lying.</t3308><t3309>”</t3309>
<t3310>I don't want to say too much about the next day.</t3310> <t3311>It's probably best to keep it short.</t3311> <t3312>I woke up at dawn, intending to turn over and go back to sleep, but suddenly I noticed how quiet everything was – there was no sign of movement.</t3312> <t3313>I was not used to this at all.</t3313> <t3314>I saw that Buck had also gotten up and left.</t3314> <t3315>So I got up and went downstairs, wondering what was going on – there was no one around; not a sound from anywhere.</t3315> <t3316>It was the same outside.</t3316> <t3317>I wondered what this could mean.</t3317> <t3318>I ran into our Jack by the woodpile.</t3318>
<t3319>“What is happening?” I asked.</t3319>
<t3320>"Don't you know, Master George?" he said.</t3320>
<t3321>“No, I don't know.</t3321><t3322>”</t3322>
<t3323>“Sophia has run away!</t3323> <t3324>Yes, she eloped.</t3324> <t3325>She ran away at night, but no one knows the exact time.</t3325> <t3326>And she ran away with that young Harney Shepherdson...</t3326> <t3327>At least that's what they say.</t3327> <t3328>The family noticed it about an hour ago – maybe a little earlier – and didn't waste any time.</t3328> <t3329>They all grabbed their rifles like lightning and mounted their horses!</t3329> <t3330>The women went to inform the neighbors, and old man Saul and his sons took their rifles and went after the runaways along the river.</t3330> <t3331>They want to catch up with the young man and Miss Sophia while they are still on this side of the river and kill the young man.</t3331> <t3332>It looks like all hell is going to break loose soon.</t3332><t3333>”</t3333>
<t3334>“Buck left without waking me up.</t3334><t3335>”</t3335>
<t3336>“Eh, they did it!”</t3336> <t3337>“They didn’t want you to get involved in this job.”</t3337> <t3338>“Mr. Buck loaded his gun and said he would rather die than bring a Shepherdson home while going.”</t3338> <t3339>“Honestly, if he had the chance, he might have really brought one of the Shepherdsons.”</t3339><t3340>”</t3340>
<t3341>I ran at full speed towards the river road.</t3341> <t3342>After a while, I heard gunshots from afar.</t3342> <t3343>When I saw the log depot where the steamships docked and the piles of wood, I found a good spot for myself by hiding among the trees and bushes, then climbed up a poplar tree and sat on a fork high enough to be unreachable from below, and started watching what was happening.</t3343> <t3344>A little further from the tree, there was a pile of wood about a meter high, and at first, I thought of hiding there; maybe it was better that I didn't.</t3344>
<t3345>Four or five mounted men were wandering around the open area in front of the timber depot, cursing and shouting; they were trying to get two young men hiding behind a stack of wood near the ship dock to come out, but the young men were not coming out.</t3345> <t3346>As soon as one of the young men showed himself on the river side of the wood stack, the men would start shooting.</t3346> <t3347>The boys were crouched back to back behind the stack, and in this way, they could see both sides.</t3347>
<t3348>After a while, the men stopped shouting and yelling around.</t3348> <t3349>They rode their horses towards the warehouse; at that moment, one of the boys stood up, took aim from the top of the woodpile, and shot one of the riders.</t3349> <t3350>The men immediately dismounted and dragged the wounded one by the arm towards the warehouse; just then, two boys started to run away.</t3350> <t3351>The boys did not attract attention until they were halfway to the tree I was sitting on.</t3351> <t3352>Then the men saw them, jumped on their horses, and chased after them.</t3352> <t3353>The men were coming fast, but they still couldn't catch up, because the boys were too far away; they reached the woodpile in front of my tree and took cover behind it again.</t3353> <t3354>One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slender young man around nineteen years old.</t3354>
<t3355>The men wandered around the area a bit more, then they left.</t3355> <t3356>As soon as they disappeared from sight, I informed Buck.</t3356> <t3357>At first, he couldn't understand why my voice was coming from a tree.</t3357> <t3358>He was very surprised.</t3358> <t3359>He told me to keep my eyes wide open and to inform him if I saw the men again; they were certainly up to something – they wouldn't stay away for long.</t3359> <t3360>I wished I wasn't at the top of the tree, I thought, but I didn't dare to come down either.</t3360> <t3361>Buck started to cry and lament, while also venting his anger; he said that he and his cousin Joe (that is, the other boy) would settle today's account.</t3361> <t3362>His father and two brothers had died, and they had taken care of two or three of the enemy.</t3362> <t3363>It turned out that the Shepherdsons had lain in ambush waiting for them.</t3363> <t3364>According to Buck, his father and brothers should have waited for their relatives – the Shepherdsons had turned out to be too strong.</t3364> <t3365>I asked what had happened to young Harney and Miss Sophia.</t3365> <t3366>They had crossed the river and were safe.</t3366> <t3367>I was glad about that; but Buck was grumbling that he hadn't finished Harney off when he fired that day – I had never heard him talk like that before.</t3367>
<t3368>Suddenly, bam! bam! bam! three or four rifles fired at once – the men had circled around us, gotten behind us, dismounted from their horses, and approached quietly!</t3368> <t3369>The children immediately jumped into the river – both were wounded.</t3369> <t3370>As they swam downstream, the men ran along the shore shooting at them, shouting, “Kill them, kill them!”</t3370> <t3371>I felt so bad that I almost fell from the tree.</t3371> <t3372>I won’t tell you everything that happened – otherwise, I’ll feel bad again.</t3372> <t3373>I keep thinking to myself, if only I hadn’t gone ashore that night, if only I hadn’t seen these things.</t3373> <t3374>The memory of them will never leave my mind – I’ve had many dreams about them.</t3374>
<t3375>I stayed in the tree until it started to get dark; I was afraid to come down.</t3375> <t3376>From time to time, I heard gunshots in the forest, far away; I also saw groups of horsemen passing by the log depot twice with rifles in their hands, so I thought the conflict was still ongoing.</t3376> <t3377>My heart was breaking, and I decided never to go near that house again because I thought it was my fault.</t3377> <t3378>I had realized that the piece of paper meant that Sophia and Harney would meet somewhere at two-thirty; if I had told her father about that paper and mentioned that his daughter was acting strangely, maybe he would have locked her in her room, and these terrible events would never have happened.</t3378>
<t3379>After climbing down from the tree, I carefully and quietly advanced along the riverbank and found two bodies floating very close to the shore. I pulled them to the land, covered their faces with something, and left as quickly as possible.</t3379> <t3380>While covering Buck's face, I shed a few tears because he had treated me very well.</t3380>
<t3381>It was almost dark now.</t3381> <t3382>I didn't head home; instead, I plunged into the forest and reached the swamp.</t3382> <t3383>I couldn't find Jim on his island, so I moved towards the creek where the raft was, near the willows, ready to jump on board and leave this dreadful place – the raft was gone!</t3383> <t3384>My God, I was so scared!</t3384> <t3385>For almost a minute, I couldn't pull myself together.</t3385> <t3386>Then I called out.</t3386> <t3387>Immediately, a response came from about ten meters away…</t3387>
<t3388>"My God! Is that you, the corner of my heart?</t3388> <t3389>Don't make any noise.</t3389><t3390>"</t3390>
<t3391>This was Jim's voice – probably no other voice has ever sounded so beautiful to me in my life.</t3391> <t3392>I immediately ran from the shore and jumped onto the raft, Jim hugged me tightly as soon as he caught me, he was very happy to see me.</t3392>
<t3393>“Oh, may you live long, my dear, I was just afraid that you had died again.</t3393> <t3394>Jack was in the field and said that you might have been shot, because you hadn't come home.</t3394> <t3395>I was going to take the news to the authorities.</t3395> <t3396>Jack turned around and until he confirmed that you were definitely dead, I said I would be ready to set out.</t3396> <t3397>How happy I am to see you again, my heart's corner.</t3397><t3398>”</t3398>
<t3399>“Alright then…</t3399> <t3400>This is very good; they will think I was killed and my body drifted down the river because they won't be able to find me…</t3400> <t3401>There are enough reasons for them to think that up there…</t3401> <t3402>So let's not waste any time, Jim, let's act immediately and get to the river quickly.</t3402><t3403>”</t3403>
<t3404>I couldn't feel at ease until we were two miles down and reached the middle of the Mississippi.</t3404> <t3405>Then we lit the signal lantern and had no doubt that we were once again free and safe.</t3405> <t3406>I hadn't put a single bite in my mouth since yesterday; Jim soon brought out cornbread, skimmed milk, pork sausage, cabbage, and greens – when prepared by an expert, no meal could match its taste.</t3406> <t3407>We chatted while I ate and had a great time.</t3407> <t3408>I was very happy to have escaped the blood feuds, and Jim was glad to have gotten out of the swamp.</t3408> <t3409>There was nothing like having your own raft.</t3409> <t3410>Everywhere else felt cramped and suffocating, but not the raft.</t3410> <t3411>On the raft, one feels completely free; carefree and comfortable.</t3411>
<t3412>The Ninth Chapter</t3412>
<t3413>Two or three more days and nights passed; or perhaps I should say flowed by, meaning they passed so quietly, smoothly, and pleasantly.</t3413><t3414>Let me tell you how the time passed.</t3414><t3415>As we went downstream, the river reached an immense width – in some places it was about a mile and a half; we traveled at night and stopped to hide during the day; in the last moments of darkness, we would move out of the current and tie up the raft.</t3415><t3416>Almost every time, we would pull up to an island in the still water, then hide the raft nicely with poplar saplings and willow branches.</t3416><t3417>Then we would cast our fishing lines.</t3417><t3418>We would go into the river and swim a bit, thus both cleaning and cooling ourselves; we would watch the sunrise from a sandy spot where the water came up to our knees.</t3418><t3419>There was not a sound around – complete silence – it was as if the whole world was asleep, only occasionally interrupted by the sound of frogs.</t3419><t3420>When you looked at the horizon over the water, the first thing you saw was a dull line – this was the line of the forest on the opposite shore – nothing else could be distinguished; a pale band appeared in the sky above it; then it spread upward; then the color of the river lightened; it gradually turned from black to gray; you could see small black dots drifting away, continuously moving farther – these were barges and similar things; and there were long black streaks – rafts; sometimes we would hear the creak of an oar or indistinct conversations; it was so quiet that sounds from very far away would reach us; after a while, lines would start to appear on the water, and by looking at the position of the lines, you could tell that there were trees under the water with a fast current passing over them; you could also see the mist gathering and lifting off the surface of the water, the eastern side turning red, the river turning red, and you could make out a log cabin at the edge of the forest, most likely a wood depot on the other side of the river.</t3420><t3421>Then a fresh breeze would come up and cool you, bringing the pleasant scents of the forest and flowers to your nose; but sometimes it wasn't so nice, because it would expose dead garfish or other fish, and as they rotted, they would smell really awful; then the day would fully break; everything would be smiling in the sunlight and the birds would start chirping madly!</t3421>
<t3422>We were preparing a warm breakfast with some of the fish caught on the lines, thinking a little smoke wouldn't attract attention anymore.</t3422><t3423>Then we would watch the solitude of the river for a while; laze around; gradually get drowsy and eventually fall asleep.</t3423><t3424>Then we would wake up to a noise and see a steamboat coughing its way upriver, but it would be on the other side of the river and so far away that it was impossible to tell whether its paddle wheel was on the side or the stern.</t3424><t3425>Then for about an hour, nothing else would be heard or seen – just solitude.</t3425><t3426>Then you would see a raft passing in the distance, perhaps with an inexperienced raftsman cutting wood on it, because such types always cut wood on the raft; you would see the axe glint as it rises and falls – but you wouldn't hear anything; then the axe rises again; as it reaches above the man's head, you hear the thud! sound, it takes that long for the sound to reach you over the water.</t3426><t3427>That's how we spent the day, lazing around, listening intently to the silence.</t3427><t3428>Once, a thick fog descended, and people on rafts and barges were clanging pots and pans to avoid being hit by steamboats as they moved along.</t3428><t3429>A barge or raft passed so close to us that we could hear the people inside cursing and laughing – we could clearly understand what they were saying; but we couldn't see them for even a moment; this sent chills down our spines, as if we were listening to the voices of spirits gliding through the air.</t3429><t3430>Jim even said he believed they were spirits.</t3430>
<t3431>But I had objected, "No soul would say 'damn this accursed fog'."</t3431>
<t3432>Before long, it got dark and we had moved away from the shore. When we reached the middle of the river, we stopped rowing and the raft continued to float downstream with the current; then we lit our pipes, stretched our feet into the water, and started chatting about this and that.</t3432> <t3433>Whenever we got a break from the mosquitoes, we were always naked; the clothes Buck's family gave me were so high-quality that I couldn't feel comfortable in them, and besides, I don't really like fussing over my clothes.</t3433>
<t3434>Sometimes there would be no one else on the river for a very long time except us.</t3434> <t3435>We would see the shores and islands ahead; maybe a spark – a candle seen from a cabin window – would catch our eye; sometimes we would see one or two sparks on the water – on a raft or a barge; sometimes we would hear the sound of a violin or someone singing from one of the river vessels.</t3435> <t3436>Living on the raft was very beautiful.</t3436> <t3437>The sky above would be speckled with stars, and we would lie on our backs and watch the stars, debating whether they were made or if they appeared suddenly – according to Jim, they were made, but I thought they appeared suddenly; in my opinion, there were too many of them to be made one by one.</t3437> <t3438>Jim had said that the moon might have laid them; well, since this seemed reasonable, I didn't object, because I had seen a frog with as many offspring as there were stars, so this was something that could happen.</t3438> <t3439>We would also see shooting stars and watch them descend.</t3439> <t3440>According to Jim, these were the rotten ones and that's why they were picked out and fell from the nest.</t3440>
<t3441>Every night, we would see a steamship moving in the dark once or twice, spewing countless sparks from its chimney, and as the sparks descended burning onto the river, it would create a magnificent view; then, as the ship turned a corner, its lights would disappear from sight, its noise would cease, and the river would become silent again; long after it had vanished, its waves would slowly reach us and gently rock the raft, and then you would hear nothing, there would be a long silence of indeterminate length, interrupted only by frogs or similar sounds.</t3441>
<t3442>After midnight, the people living by the shore would go to bed, and for the next two or three hours, the beaches would be shrouded in darkness – no sparks would flicker in the cabin windows.</t3442> <t3443>Those sparks marked our time – when we started to see them again, we knew that morning was approaching, and we would immediately tie up the raft and start looking for a place to hide.</t3443>
<t3444>One morning, just as dawn was breaking, I found a canoe and entered a swift current – it was only about two hundred meters – and reached the riverbank. Then, I went up a creek among the cypress trees for about a mile to find some berries.</t3444> <t3445>Just as I was passing a place where the creek cut across a wide path, didn't two men come running for their lives!</t3445> <t3446>Ah, this time I'm done for, I said to myself; because whenever I saw someone running, I thought they were chasing me – or Jim.</t3446> <t3447>I was about to grab the oars to get away quickly, but they were already very close, calling out to me and asking me to save their lives – according to them, they hadn't done anything and were being chased for no reason – there were men and dogs behind them.</t3447> <t3448>They immediately wanted to jump into the canoe, but I stopped them:</t3448>
<t3449>“Do not mount here.</t3449> <t3450>I do not hear the sounds of the dogs and horses yet; you still have time to go a bit upstream through the bushes; then you can enter the water, come downstream to me, and then you can mount...</t3450> <t3451>That way, the dogs won't catch your scent.</t3451><t3452>”</t3452>
<t3453>They did as I said; right after they got into the canoe, I set off towards our little island; within five to ten minutes, we heard the dogs and men passing by, shouting and yelling.</t3453> <t3454>We could hear them coming towards the creek, but we couldn't see them.</t3454> <t3455>It seemed to me that they lingered around there for a while.</t3455> <t3456>After that, we didn't hear their voices again because we were constantly moving away.</t3456> <t3457>We moved in silence until we left the forest about a mile behind and reached the river, then we rowed to our little island, hid among the poplars; we were safe now.</t3457>
<t3458>One of the men was seventy or older; his head was bald and his sideburns were quite gray.</t3458> <t3459>He had an old, tattered hat on his head, and a blue wool shirt covered in grease on his back; he had tucked the frayed cuffs of his blue jeans into his boots; he had homemade suspenders – no, more precisely, he had a single suspender.</t3459> <t3460>He had slung an old long denim jacket with makeshift brass buttons over his arm; additionally, he had a swollen, dirty-looking kilim bag in each hand.</t3460>
<t3461>The other man was in his thirties and was as shabbily dressed as the other.</t3461> <t3462>After breakfast, we all lay down where we were and started talking, and the first thing we noticed was that these men did not know each other.</t3462>
<t3463>"How did you get yourself into trouble?" asked the bald one to the other.</t3463>
<t3464>“I was selling a material that removes dental calculus…</t3464> <t3465>It really does remove it, but it usually takes the tooth enamel with it. I stayed one night longer than I should have, and just as I was preparing to flee, I met you on the road on this side of the town.</t3465> <t3466>You said they were after you and asked me to help you escape.</t3466> <t3467>At that point, I told you I was in trouble too and started running away with you.</t3467> <t3468>That's all there is to it…</t3468> <t3469>What was your problem?</t3469><t3470>”</t3470>
<t3471>“I had been holding small meetings against the sale and consumption of alcohol for a week.</t3471> <t3472>I had won the love of all the women, big and small, because I was giving the drunks a hard time.</t3472> <t3473>I was making about five or six dollars a night – I was charging ten cents per head, it was free for children and black people – business was good, and the number of attendees was increasing.</t3473> <t3474>But last night, a rumor started out of nowhere: Apparently, I was secretly taking swigs from a hidden jug.</t3474> <t3475>This morning, a black man came and woke me up and said that people were starting to gather quietly.</t3475> <t3476>They would be here soon with their dogs and horses, and after giving me a half-hour head start, they would chase me; when they caught me, they would tar and feather me and ride me on a rail.</t3476> <t3477>I couldn't stay for breakfast – I had lost my appetite.</t3477><t3478>”</t3478>
<t3479>“Dad, I see that we could make a good team,” said the younger one.</t3479> <t3480>“What do you think?</t3480><t3481>”</t3481>
<t3482>"I have no objections."</t3482> <t3483>"What is your profession...</t3483> <t3484>I mean generally?"</t3484><t3485>"</t3485>
<t3486>“I am a master printer who grew up in the trade; I know a bit about medicines; I can act – tragedy and such; if I get the chance, I am interested in hypnotism and phrenology, I can read character by looking at the skull; sometimes, for a change, I teach singing and geography; I give sermons – I do a lot of things – I have a finger in every pie, as long as it's not menial work.</t3486> <t3487>So what do you do?</t3487><t3488>”</t3488>
<t3489>“Once upon a time, I practiced medicine for a long time.</t3489> <t3490>Healing with my hands is what I do best – for cancer, paralysis, and similar things; also, if I have a man to gather the necessary information for me, I can read fortunes very well.</t3490> <t3491>I also understand preaching; I work in tent meetings and missionary work.</t3491><t3492>”</t3492>
<t3493>No one said anything for a long time; then the young man sighed deeply.</t3493>
<t3494>“Ah, what a pity!</t3494><t3495>”</t3495>
<t3496>“What are you lamenting?” asked the bald-headed one.</t3496>
<t3497>"That I have come to live such a life, that I have fallen so low as to live among such people."</t3497> <t3498>He began to wipe the corner of his eye with a cloth.</t3498>
<t3499>The bald-headed one brazenly stood up: "Oh really, do we not look good enough for you?"</t3499><t3500></t3500>
<t3501>“No way, you’re fine, you’re good; besides, this is what I deserve anyway, isn’t someone like me who fell from the top to here worthy of this?</t3501> <t3502>I brought this upon myself.</t3502> <t3503>I am not blaming you, gentlemen…</t3503> <t3504>Don’t even think such a thing; I am not blaming anyone.</t3504> <t3505>I deserved all of it.</t3505> <t3506>Let the merciless life do its worst; the only thing I know is…</t3506> <t3507>there is a grave somewhere for me too.</t3507> <t3508>No matter how this world turns, even if it takes everything from me – my loved ones, my possessions, everything – it cannot take this from me.</t3508> <t3509>One day I will enter that grave and forget everything, and at that moment my broken heart will find peace.”</t3509> <t3510>He started to cry.</t3510>
<t3511>“Damn your poor broken heart,” said the bald-headed man; “why are you pinning that poor broken heart on us?</t3511> <t3512>What did we do to you?</t3512><t3513>”</t3513>
<t3514>“I know you didn't do anything.</t3514> <t3515>I'm not blaming you, gentlemen.</t3515> <t3516>The reason for my downfall is me…</t3516> <t3517>I am responsible for all of it.</t3517> <t3518>It is right for me to suffer…</t3518> <t3519>This is the most correct…</t3519> <t3520>I'm not complaining.</t3520><t3521>”</t3521>
<t3522>“Where did you fall from?</t3522> <t3523>What caused you to fall?</t3523><t3524>”</t3524>
<t3525>“Ah, you wouldn't believe me; no one in the world would believe me...</t3525> <t3526>Never mind...</t3526> <t3527>It's not important.</t3527> <t3528>The secret of my birth...</t3528><t3529>”</t3529>
<t3530>“What was the secret at his birth?”</t3530> <t3531>“What do you mean?”</t3531><t3532>”</t3532>
<t3533>The young man said with great seriousness, "Gentlemen; I will reveal my secret to you, because I feel that I can trust you."</t3533> <t3534>"I am the son of a duke!</t3534><t3535>"</t3535>
<t3536>When Jim heard this, his eyes popped out of their sockets; surely, my eyes must have popped out too.</t3536> <t3537>Upon this, the bald man started to speak:</t3537>
<t3538>“No way!</t3538> <t3539>You can't be serious, right?</t3539><t3540>”</t3540>
<t3541>“Yes.</t3541> <t3542>My great-great-grandfather was the eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater; he fled to this country at the end of the last century to breathe the pure air of freedom; he married here; when he died, leaving behind a son, his own father had also died.</t3542> <t3543>The deceased duke's second son seized the title and estates – the true baby duke was ignored.</t3543> <t3544>I am descended from that baby – the right to be the Duke of Bridgewater is mine; but here I am, in a wretched state, stripped of my estates and nobility, people are chasing after me; this cruel world hates me; my clothes are in tatters, I am worn out, my heart is broken, and I have fallen so low as to travel on a raft with outlaws!</t3544><t3545>”</t3545>
<t3546>Jim felt very sorry for him, and so did I.</t3546> <t3547>We tried to comfort him, but he said it wouldn't work, that he was beyond consolation; he said that if we showed the courtesy of accepting his dukedom, we would be doing him a kindness beyond anything else; we said we would be happy to do so if he told us how.</t3547> <t3548>When speaking with him, we had to bow and address him as "Your Excellency," "Your Lordship," or "Honorable Duke" – although it was also acceptable to simply call him "Bridgewater" – because that was not his name, but his title; additionally, one of us had to serve him at meals and attend to his small requests.</t3548>
<t3549>All of this was very easy, and we did it too.</t3549> <t3550>During the meal, Jim stood up and served him, asking, "Would His Excellency like a bit of this or that?" It was clear that the man was very pleased with this situation.</t3550>
<t3551>But the old man had become silent; he seemed to be increasingly disturbed by our circling around the shop and serving him.</t3551> <t3552>I think he had something on his mind too.</t3552>
<t3553>In the afternoon, he started talking to the duke at some point:</t3553>
<t3554>“Look at me, Bridgewater,” he said, “I am very sorry for you, but you are not the only one with such problems?</t3554><t3555>”</t3555>
<t3556>"Am I not?"</t3556><t3557>"</t3557>
<t3558>"No; you are not.</t3558> <t3559>You are not the only person who has been unjustly brought down from a high position.</t3559><t3560>"</t3560>
<t3561>“What a disaster!</t3561><t3562>”</t3562>
<t3563>“You are not the only one with a secret about their birth.”</t3563> <t3564>This time, the old man started crying.</t3564>
<t3565>“Wait a minute! What do you mean?</t3565><t3566>”</t3566>
<t3567>"Bridgewater, can I trust you?" asked the old man, continuing to sob uncontrollably.</t3567>
<t3568>"You can take my life, but you can't take my secret!" Holding the old man's hand tightly, "Your secret is safe with me.</t3568> <t3569>Tell me!" he said.</t3569>
<t3570>“Bridgewater; I am the heir to the French throne who was thought to be dead!</t3570><t3571>”</t3571>
<t3572>Jim and I were left standing with our mouths agape this time.</t3572> <t3573>The Duke felt the need to repeat:</t3573>
<t3574>“What are you?</t3574><t3575>”</t3575>
<t3576>“Yes, my friend, this is true…</t3576> <t3577>these eyes are looking right now at the poor, lost heir; I am Louis XVII; the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette.</t3577><t3578>”</t3578>
<t3579>"Is it you?</t3579> <t3580>At this age?</t3580> <t3581>Impossible! Are you saying you are the last Charlemagne?</t3581> <t3582>You should be at least six hundred – seven hundred years old though.</t3582><t3583>"</t3583>
<t3584>“Troubles have brought me to this state, Bridgewater; I have fallen into this condition because of my troubles; these gray hairs, this bald head are all due to distress and suffering.</t3584> <t3585>Yes, gentlemen; before you stands the legitimate King of France, wandering in misery, exiled, trampled underfoot, wearing blue jeans.</t3585><t3586>”</t3586>
<t3587>He cried and whined so much that Jim and I didn't know what to do, we were very upset – but we were also very pleased and proud to be with him.</t3587> <t3588>So we tried to comfort him just as we had done with the duke before.</t3588> <t3589>But he said it wouldn't do any good, nothing would help him except dying and getting rid of everything; although he said he would feel a little better if people treated him as he deserved; they should kneel on one knee while talking to him; call him "Your Majesty," serve him first at meals, and not sit down until he gave permission.</t3589> <t3590>So Jim and I started calling him your majesty, doing this and that for him, and standing until he told us we could sit.</t3590> <t3591>What we did made him feel very good, he became a cheerful and relaxed man again.</t3591> <t3592>But this time the duke was frowning; he didn't seem at all pleased with the turn of events; still, the king was really friendly to him, saying that his father loved the duke's great-great-grandfather and the other Dukes of Bridgewater very much and often invited them to the palace; but when the duke couldn't shake off his resentment for a while, the king finally said:</t3592>
<t3593>“It looks like we will stay on this raft for quite a long time; Bridgewater; what's the use of making a face?</t3593> <t3594>You only make things more uncomfortable.</t3594> <t3595>It's not my fault that I wasn't born a Duke, and it's not your fault that you weren't born a king…</t3595> <t3596>They say, 'A sharp vinegar harms its own container.'</t3596> <t3597>Appreciate what you have, that's what I say…</t3597> <t3598>That is my motto.</t3598> <t3599>It's not a bad thing that we ended up here…</t3599> <t3600>There's plenty of food, we're in high spirits…</t3600> <t3601>Come on, give me your hand Duke, let's all be friends now.</t3601><t3602>”</t3602>
<t3603>When the Duke did what he said, Jim and I were very happy.</t3603> <t3604>All our discomforts flew away, we felt very good, because there is nothing as terrible as resentment on a raft; the first thing you want on a raft is for everyone to be satisfied, to treat others correctly and well.</t3604>
<t3605>It didn't take me long to realize that these two liars were not a king or a duke, but mere braggarts and frauds.</t3605> <t3606>But I definitely didn't open my mouth, I didn't reveal that I understood; that was the best, then you don't have to argue, and you don't get into trouble.</t3606> <t3607>If they wanted us to call them king and duke, I wouldn't object as long as we could maintain peace in the family; besides, it wouldn't have been useful to explain this to Jim, so I didn't.</t3607> <t3608>If I learned nothing else from my father, I learned that the only way to get along with people like him was not to mess with them.</t3608>
<t3609>Chapter Twenty</t3609>
<t3610>The duke and the king asked us a lot of questions; they wondered why we hid on Tuesday, why we hid during the day instead of escaping – or was Jim a runaway black man?</t3610>
<t3611>“For God's sake,” I said, “do runaway negroes go south?</t3611><t3612>”</t3612>
<t3613>No; they said it wouldn't go.</t3613> <t3614>But I still needed to explain what had happened somehow.</t3614> <t3615>I began to explain:</t3615>
<t3616>“My family lived in Pike County, Missouri; I was born there.</t3616> <t3617>They all passed away, leaving no one but my father and my brother Ike.</t3617> <t3618>My father said we would leave everything behind and go down the river to stay with Uncle Ben.</t3618> <t3619>Uncle Ben had a nice little piece of land on the river, forty-four miles below Orleans.</t3619> <t3620>My father was very poor and had accumulated debts; so when he gathered everything, he only had sixteen dollars and our black servant Jim left.</t3620> <t3621>Even if we slept on the deck, this money wouldn't be enough to take us fourteen hundred miles.</t3621> <t3622>Then, when the river rose, my father got lucky and caught this piece of raft; we thought we could go to Orleans by raft.</t3622> <t3623>But my father's luck didn't last; one night while on the way, a steamboat passed by the corner of the front of the raft, we all tumbled into the water and dived to avoid the paddlewheel.</t3623> <t3624>Jim and I managed to come back up, but my father was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, they never surfaced again.</t3624> <t3625>For the next couple of days, we were in constant trouble because people coming in boats tried to take Jim away from me, saying he was a runaway slave.</t3625> <t3626>So we no longer travel during the day; no one bothers us at night.</t3626><t3627>”</t3627>
<t3628>“Give me some time,” said the duke.</t3628> <t3629>“I will think of a way for us to be able to travel during the day when necessary.</t3629> <t3630>After thoroughly considering the matter...</t3630> <t3631>I will make a plan that will set everything right.</t3631> <t3632>Let's continue like this for today, because we certainly don't want to pass through that town ahead during the day; it might not be very safe.</t3632><t3633>”</t3633>
<t3634>Towards the evening, the sky clouded over, it was going to rain; lightning was flashing on the horizon, the sound of which did not reach us, and the leaves had started to tremble – a very harsh weather was coming, it was not hard to understand this.</t3634> <t3635>The Duke and the King went to inspect our shelter to see how the beds were.</t3635> <t3636>The inside of my mattress was filled with straw and it was more comfortable than Jim's corn husk mattress; the husks would remain inside the mattress, poke your back, and hurt you; moreover, when you turned in bed, the dried husks would make a sound as if you were lying in a pile of dry leaves; they would creak so much that you would wake up.</t3636> <t3637>The Duke said he would take my bed, but the King did not allow it.</t3637>
<t3638>“I thought the difference in our positions would remind you that it is not appropriate for me to sleep in the bed with the tassels.</t3638> <t3639>Your Excellency should sleep in the bed with the tassels.</t3639><t3640>”</t3640>
<t3641>Jim and I had started to worry again, fearing that there would be trouble between them; so we were relieved by the duke's response:</t3641>
<t3642>“It is my fate to be muddied under the iron heel of the mighty.</t3642> <t3643>Misfortune has long taken away my proud spirit; I bow, I surrender; this is my fate.</t3643> <t3644>I am all alone in this world…</t3644> <t3645>I must endure my suffering; I can bear it.</t3645><t3646>”</t3646>
<t3647>As soon as it got dark enough, we set out immediately.</t3647> <t3648>The king told us to stay in the middle of the river and not to show any light until we had gone quite a bit downstream of the town.</t3648> <t3649>After a while, we saw a small cluster of lights – this cluster was the town – and we passed it without any trouble about half a mile offshore.</t3649> <t3650>When we had gone about three-quarters of a mile downstream, we put up the signal lantern; around ten o'clock, it started to rain, and lightning began to illuminate everything around; the king told us both to keep watch until the weather cleared up; then he and the duke went into the shelter to get ready to sleep.</t3650> <t3651>The watch on the downstream side was mine until twelve, but even if I had a bed to sleep in, I wouldn't have gone into the shelter; because you can't see such a storm every day, you don't even get the chance to watch it from a distance.</t3651> <t3652>My God, how the wind was howling!</t3652> <t3653>Almost every second, there was a flash of light illuminating the foamy waves around us within a half-mile distance; we could see blurry islands in the rain and trees flapping in the wind; then crack! – the thunder rumbled and roared away with crashes and booms, then it went silent – then another crack of lightning and again a thunder.</t3653> <t3654>The waves were so big they almost knocked me off the raft, but I didn't care since I had no clothes on.</t3654> <t3655>The bushes and such that the raft could get caught on were no trouble at all; there was so much lightning that we could see them well in advance and steer the raft around them.</t3655>
<t3656>The second watch was mine, but I was getting really sleepy, so Jim said he could take the first half of my watch; Jim has always been such a kind-hearted person.</t3656> <t3657>I bent down and went inside the shelter, but I couldn't find a place for myself because the king and the duke were lying with their legs spread out; so I went back outside – I didn't mind the rain because the weather was warm and the waves weren't rising that much anymore.</t3657> <t3658>Around two in the night, the waves rose again, Jim was about to call out to me, but then he changed his mind because he thought the waves hadn't risen enough to cause any harm yet; however, he was wrong about that, because a little later a giant wave came and knocked me into the water.</t3658> <t3659>Jim almost died laughing.</t3659> <t3660>I've never seen a black man who laughs so easily at everything in my life.</t3660>
<t3661>I took over the watch and Jim immediately lay down and started snoring; the storm was gradually dying down, and when I saw the first cabin light, I woke Jim up and we started looking for a place to hide the raft for the day.</t3661>
<t3662>After breakfast, the king took out a worn deck of playing cards and played a game of "Old Maid" with the duke for a while.</t3662> <t3663>Then they got bored of the game and said they were going to "go on an adventure," as they put it.</t3663> <t3664>After rummaging through his carpet bag for a bit, the duke pulled out a bunch of printed flyers and started reading them aloud.</t3664> <t3665>One of the flyers read: "The Famous Dr. Armand de Montalban from Paris" will give a lecture on "The Science of Phrenology" at such and such a place on such and such a date, admission is ten cents, and for twenty-five cents, he will also do a character analysis."</t3665> <t3666>The duke said that he was this doctor.</t3666> <t3667>According to another flyer, he was "The World-Renowned Actor Young Garrick from Drury Lane, London," who performed Shakespearean tragedies.</t3667> <t3668>According to other flyers, he had many more names and had done other amazing things, like finding water and gold with a "divining rod," "breaking witches' spells," and so on.</t3668> <t3669>Finally, he said:</t3669>
<t3670>“But my favorite thing is the miracle of theater.</t3670> <t3671>Have you ever tasted the dust of the stage before, my King?</t3671><t3672>”</t3672>
<t3673>"No," said the king.</t3673>
<t3674>“Then you must do it without wasting much time, Your Majesty the Deposed King,” said the duke.</t3674> <t3675>“In the first good town we come across, we'll rent a hall and perform the sword fight from Richard III</t3675> <t3676>and the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.</t3676> <t3677>What do you say to that?</t3677><t3678>”</t3678>
<t3679>“I wholeheartedly embrace anything that brings money, Bridgewater, but I don't understand much about acting, and I haven't seen many actors.</t3679> <t3680>When my noble father watched theater at the palace, I was very young.</t3680> <t3681>Can you teach me?</t3681><t3682>”</t3682>
<t3683>“Easy!</t3683><t3684>”</t3684>
<t3685>“Alright then.</t3685> <t3686>I was already eager to learn something new.</t3686> <t3687>Okay, let's start right away.</t3687><t3688>”</t3688>
<t3689>The Duke told him everything about Romeo and Juliet; he was used to being Romeo, so the king would have to be Juliet.</t3689>
<t3690>“But Juliet is a very young girl, Duke, I feel like I would look a bit odd in this role with my bald head and white sideburns.</t3690><t3691>”</t3691>
<t3692>“Don't worry about that...</t3692> <t3693>These provincial fools won't care at all.</t3693> <t3694>Besides, you'll have a costume and that makes an extraordinary difference; Juliet is standing on the balcony; watching the moon before going to bed, wearing her nightgown and a frilly nightcap.</t3694> <t3695>These are the costumes for this role.</t3695><t3696>”</t3696>
<t3697>He took out two or three sets of drapery; These were III.</t3697> <t3698>Richard's medieval armor and the other man's costume, along with a long white cotton nightgown and a matching ruffled nightcap.</t3698> <t3699>The king looked satisfied; The duke took out his book and began to read the lines dramatically, opening his arms, jumping up and down, and doing the movements of his part, to show her how acting is done; Then he gave the book to the king and asked him to memorize his part.</t3699>
<t3700>There was a small town three miles down the bend; after dinner, he said he had thought of something that would allow us to travel during the day without putting Jim in danger; he would go to the town and take care of it.</t3700> <t3701>The King also wanted to go, hoping an opportunity might arise.</t3701> <t3702>We were out of coffee, so Jim said it would be good for me to get in the canoe with them and get some coffee.</t3702>
<t3703>When we arrived at the town, we didn't see anyone; the streets were empty, not a sound was heard, it was as if it were a Sunday.</t3703> <t3704>We came across a sick black man sunbathing in a garden, and he told us that everyone who wasn't very small, very sick, or very old had gone to a religious meeting about two miles into the forest.</t3704> <t3705>The King had the route thoroughly explained and said he would go and see if anything could be made of that meeting, and that I could go with him.</t3705>
<t3706>The Duke said he needed to find a printing press.</t3706> <t3707>We found a small printing press on the upper floor of a carpenter's shop – all the carpenters and printers had gone to the meeting and the doors were not locked.</t3707> <t3708>The printing press was filthy, with a lot of debris and ink stains on the floor.</t3708> <t3709>A lot of posters with pictures of horses and runaway slaves were hung on the walls.</t3709> <t3710>The Duke took off his jacket and said he would handle it from here.</t3710> <t3711>I set off with the King towards the tent meeting.</t3711>
<t3712>When we arrived there half an hour later, we were drenched in sweat; the weather was incredibly hot.</t3712> <t3713>There were about a thousand people at the campsite, coming from a distance of approximately twenty miles.</t3713> <t3714>The forest was filled with cars, animals tied here and there were feeding in the car troughs, wagging their tails and stamping their feet to fend off flies.</t3714> <t3715>Lemonade and gingerbread were being sold in arbors made of poles and covered with branches, and also watermelons, corn, and similar things were piled up here and there.</t3715>
<t3716>Sermons were also given in similar arbors, but these arbors were larger and could accommodate a lot of people.</t3716> <t3717>Rows were made from the outer slices of logs, and holes were drilled into the curved sides to attach footrests.</t3717> <t3718>These rows had no backrests.</t3718> <t3719>The preachers stood on high pulpits at one end of the arbor.</t3719> <t3720>The women wore wide-brimmed hats; some wore dresses made of linen mixed with wool, some of striped cotton fabric, and some wore calico dresses.</t3720> <t3721>Some of the young men were barefoot, and some children wore nothing but a cheap shirt.</t3721> <t3722>Some of the elderly women were knitting, and some of the young people were secretly flirting.</t3722>
<t3723>In the first pavilion we reached, the preacher was singing a hymn.</t3723> <t3724>He sang two lines, and then everyone repeated after him; it sounded magnificent, there were a lot of people and they were singing in a very exhilarating manner; the preacher sang two more lines – they sang again.</t3724> <t3725>People were becoming more lively and singing louder; by the end, some were shouting, some were screaming.</t3725> <t3726>After that, the preacher began his sermon with great sincerity; he was moving from one end of the platform to the other; then he would come forward and lean towards the crowd; his arms and body were constantly in motion, and he was shouting his words with all his might; he would also lift and open the Holy Bible from time to time; shaking it this way and that, he would shout: “The brazen serpent in the wilderness!</t3726> <t3727>Look and live!” The people were also shouting: “Oh my God!..</t3727> <t3728>Amen!” The preacher continued, and the people were sighing and groaning; crying; shouting amen:</t3728>
<t3729>“Ah, come to the line of the mourners!</t3729> <t3730>Come those who are blackened with sin! (amen!) come the sick and wounded! (amen!) come the crippled and the weak and the blind! (amen!) come the poor and the needy; those drowned in shame! (amiiin!) come the worn out; come the tainted and the suffering!., come with your broken spirits!</t3730> <t3731>Come with repentant hearts!</t3731> <t3732>Come with your sins and filth in rags!</t3732> <t3733>The cleansing waters are free, the gates of heaven are wide open – oh, enter, enter and find peace!” (Amiin! Almighty God, Almighty God, Praise be to God!</t3733><t3734>)</t3734>
<t3735>It continued like this.</t3735> <t3736>Because of the shouting and crying, you could no longer understand what the preacher was saying.</t3736> <t3737>People from within the crowd were standing up; making their way with difficulty, they came to the row of mourners with tears in their eyes; after all the mourners filled the front rows, they sang hymns; they shouted; they threw themselves onto the straw on the ground as if they had gone mad.</t3737>
<t3738>I saw that our king had also gone to their side, drowning out everyone's voices with his shouts; then he broke away from the crowd and walked to the podium, asking the preacher for permission to speak to the people.</t3738> <t3739>He told the crowd that he was a pirate, had been pirating in the Indian Ocean for thirty years; in the battles he fought last spring, his crew had dwindled significantly and now he had returned home to find new men, but thank God he had been robbed last night and had disembarked from a steamboat without a single cent in his pocket.</t3739> <t3740>He considered himself lucky for what had happened to him, because he was now a new man and for the first time in his life he felt happy; despite being poor, he would immediately start working and return to the Indian Ocean to dedicate his life to setting other pirates on the right path; because he knew all the pirates in that ocean well and was the perfect man for the job; it would be difficult to go there without money in his pocket, but he would still go and whenever he guided a pirate to the right path, he would say to him: “Don't thank me, the honor does not belong to me, but to the dear people at the Pokeville meeting; they are our brothers in this world and the next and the benefactors of humanity – this dear preacher is the best friend a pirate could have!</t3740><t3741>”</t3741>
<t3742>Then she burst into tears, and everyone else started crying too.</t3742> <t3743>Then I heard someone shout: "Let's collect money for her, come on, reach into your pockets!" Five or six people rushed to collect money, but someone else shouted, "It would be better if she passed around her hat."</t3743> <t3744>Everyone, including the preacher, said that would be better.</t3744>
<t3745>Upon this, the king wiped away his tears and began to walk among the crowd with his hat; meanwhile, he was praying for them, praising and thanking them for doing so much good for the poor pirates far away; from time to time, very cute girls would stand up with tears streaming down their cheeks, kiss him, and beg him to allow them to keep his memory; he never objected, sometimes hugging and kissing some of them five or six times – he was invited to stay in the town for a week; everyone wanted to host him in their home and said it would be an honor; but the king said that since it was the last day of the meeting, it was not necessary, and moreover, he was in a hurry to set sail immediately towards the Indian Ocean and work among the pirates.</t3745>
<t3746>When we returned to the room, we saw that he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents when he counted the money.</t3746> <t3747>Additionally, he had found and taken a three-gallon whiskey barrel from under a car on the way home.</t3747> <t3748>He said that all the scams he had pulled off in religious meetings throughout his life paled in comparison to today's.</t3748> <t3749>There was no need to beat around the bush; when it came to shaking down religious meetings, all the infidels trailed behind the pirates.</t3749>
<t3750>Until the king arrived, the duke thought he was doing quite well, but then he changed his mind.</t3750> <t3751>He had done two small jobs for the farmers at the printing press –horse advertisements– and earned four dollars in return.</t3751> <t3752>Then he had gotten a ten-dollar advertisement for the newspaper, but he had said he would settle for four dollars if they paid upfront – and they had agreed.</t3752> <t3753>The price of the newspaper was two dollars a year, but he had subscribed three people for half a dollar each on the condition that they paid upfront; the men, as usual, wanted to pay with wood and onions, but he had said that he had recently acquired the printing press, had lowered the price as much as possible, and therefore would only accept cash.</t3753> <t3754>He had made up a three-stanza poem from his own mind; the poem, which gave a feeling both sweet and sorrowful, was titled, “Damn this broken heart of mine, oh merciless world.”</t3754> <t3755>He had prepared the type and made it ready to be printed in the newspaper and had not taken any money for it.</t3755> <t3756>In the end, he had pocketed nine and a half dollars and thought that was quite good for a day.</t3756>
<t3757>Then he showed us another advertisement that he had printed and not taken money for, this time it was for us.</t3757> <t3758>The advertisement featured a picture of a black man running away with a bundle tied to a stick over his shoulder, and underneath it said "200 dollars reward".</t3758> <t3759>The description detailed Jim's appearance down to the smallest detail.</t3759> <t3760>It also mentioned that the black man had escaped from the St.</t3760> <t3761>Jacques plantation forty miles below New Orleans last winter and was likely heading north, and that those who caught and returned him would receive both the reward and their expenses.</t3761>
<t3762>“After tonight, if you want, we can travel during the day as well,” said the duke.</t3762> <t3763>“If we see someone coming, we’ll tie Jim’s hands and feet with rope and lay him in the shelter, show the visitors the notice, and tell them that we caught him while he was going up the river, that we borrowed this raft from our friends because we didn’t have money to travel by steamboat, and that we’re going to collect the reward.</t3763> <t3764>Although handcuffs and chains would look better, it would contradict our story of being very poor.</t3764> <t3765>It would be like wearing jewelry.</t3765> <t3766>It’s best to use rope – as we always say in plays, we need to maintain consistency.</t3766><t3767>”</t3767>
<t3768>We all said that the duke was very clever and that there would no longer be any harm in traveling during the day.</t3768> <t3769>We thought we would cover enough distance that night to get away from the commotion caused by what the duke had done at the printing house in that small town; after that, we could continue our journey if we wished.</t3769>
<t3770>We avoided showing ourselves and making noise, we did not appear in public until ten o'clock, then we set out quite far from the town and did not light our lantern until the town was completely out of sight.</t3770>
<t3771>When Jim woke me up at four in the morning to take over the watch, he asked:</t3771>
<t3772>“Huck, do we rob other people on the road?</t3772><t3773>”</t3773>
<t3774>“No,” I said, “I don't think so at all.</t3774><t3775>”</t3775>
<t3776>“Alright then,” he said.</t3776> <t3777>“I can handle two scoundrels, but I don't want more.</t3777> <t3778>This scoundrel is a complete drunkard, and the shopkeeper is no better.</t3778><t3779>”</t3779>
<t3780>I learned that Jim tried to make the king speak French to hear how it was spoken, but the king said he had forgotten French because he had been in this country for so long and had gone through so many ordeals.</t3780>
<t3781>Chapter Twenty-One</t3781>
<t3782>The sun had already risen, but we continued on our way, we hadn't tied the raft to anywhere.</t3782> <t3783>The king and the duke, who were hungover from the night before, staggered out of the shelter one by one; but jumping into the water and swimming a bit did them a lot of good.</t3783> <t3784>After breakfast, the king sat in a corner of the raft, took off his boots, rolled up his pant legs, dangled his feet in the water, got comfortable, lit his pipe, and started memorizing Romeo and Juliet.</t3784> <t3785>After he had learned his role well, they started practicing together with the duke.</t3785> <t3786>The duke had to teach him how to say each line over and over again; he showed him how to place his hand on his heart and sigh, and after a while, he said he was performing his role quite well; "just," he said, "no bellowing like a bull when you say Romeo!...</t3786> <t3787>you'll say it softly, as if you're sick, suffering...</t3787> <t3788>you'll say R-o-o-meo! because Juliet is a sweet and lovely young girl, she doesn't bray like a donkey.</t3788><t3789>"</t3789>
<t3790>Then they brought out a pair of swords made of oak by the duke and began to try sword fighting – the duke called himself Richard III.</t3790> <t3791>It was very impressive to watch them fight and jump around on the raft.</t3791> <t3792>But after a while, the king got tired and lost his balance, falling into the water; after that, they rested a bit and talked about other adventures they had along the river.</t3792>
<t3793>In the evening after dinner, the duke said, "Alright, Capet, we want this to be a first-class show, so we need to make some additions.</t3793> <t3794>If the audience calls for an encore, we should have something to perform on stage.</t3794><t3795>"</t3795>
<t3796>“What do you say, Bridgewater?</t3796><t3797>”</t3797>
<t3798>The Duke told him, then said, "If they want me again, I'll do a Scottish dance or a sailor's dance; you...</t3798> <t3799>aha, I've got it...</t3799> <t3800>you can perform Hamlet's soliloquy.</t3800><t3801>"</t3801>
<t3802>“What's up with Hamlet?</t3802><t3803>”</t3803>
<t3804>“Here is Hamlet's monologue; it is the most famous scene in Shakespeare.</t3804> <t3805>Oh, what a magnificent scene it is!</t3805> <t3806>Everyone is left in awe.</t3806> <t3807>It's not in this book though...</t3807> <t3808>I only have one volume in my hand...</t3808> <t3809>But I think I can recite it from memory.</t3809> <t3810>I just need to pace for a minute and search through the cellar of my memories.</t3810><t3811>”</t3811>
<t3812>Thinking about this, he began to walk back and forth, occasionally furrowing his brows in a terrifying manner; then he would raise his eyebrows, place his hand on his forehead, and step back with a groan; then he would sigh, and shed a tear.</t3812> <t3813>It was very enjoyable to watch him.</t3813> <t3814>Gradually, he remembered.</t3814> <t3815>He told us to pay attention.</t3815> <t3816>He took his most noble stance, put one foot forward, spread his arms, threw his head back and looked up to the sky; he began to shout and scream wildly and grind his teeth; then he recited the tirade howlingly, making gestures with his arms and puffing out his chest.</t3816> <t3817>Honestly, it was a performance that surpassed all the actors I had seen until that day.</t3817> <t3818>I can repeat his words exactly...</t3818> <t3819>I memorized them all easily while he was teaching the king:</t3819>
<t3820>There is one more possibility, do you mean dying?</t3820>
<t3821>It is a dagger drawn from its sheath</t3821>
<t3822>Making long life a hell;</t3822>
<t3823>Who until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane</t3823>
<t3824>Who can bear this burden</t3824>
<t3825>But the fear of something after death</t3825>
<t3826>Disrupting the uninterrupted sleep</t3826>
<t3827>The main dish of the great nature</t3827>
<t3828>The arrows shot by the cruel fate instead of him</t3828>
<t3829>Rather than fleeing to the unknown others.</t3829>
<t3830>Out of respect, we remain silent at this point:</t3830>
<t3831>Wake Duncan by knocking on the door!</t3831> <t3832>Oh, if only he would wake up;</t3832>
<t3833>Who bears the whips and scorns of time,</t3833>
<t3834>The tyrant's wrath, the trampling of his pride,</t3834>
<t3835>The delay of justice, the agony of the fatal blow</t3835>
<t3836>In the barren desolation, in the middle of the night, as you open your mouth</t3836>
<t3837>Cemeteries, with mourning black garments</t3837>
<t3838>The undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns</t3838>
<t3839>Blows its poison into the world</t3839>
<t3840>Thus, the natural color of what comes from the heart</t3840>
<t3841>Carefully made sick; just like the poor cat in the fairy tale</t3841>
<t3842>All the clouds that have settled on our roofs</t3842>
<t3843>The roads are crossed and gone</t3843>
<t3844>They lose the name of what they have done.</t3844>
<t3845>Isn't this a heartfelt plea for completion?</t3845>
<t3846>But woe is me, beautiful Ophelia:</t3846>
<t3847>Don't open your mouth that is as heavy as marble</t3847>
<t3848>Go enter a monastery…</t3848> <t3849>Quickly, too!</t3849>
<t3850>The old man had liked this tirade and learned it well enough to deliver a first-class performance in a short time.</t3850> <t3851>It was as if he was born for this role; it was absolutely delightful to watch him swing his arms and puff out his chest when he got carried away and excited during practice.</t3851>
<t3852>At the first opportunity we found, the duke had show posters printed; then for the next two or three days as we went down the river, the raft became an extraordinarily lively place; because the sword fights and, as the duke called them, rehearsals almost never stopped.</t3852> <t3853>One morning, as we had come quite a way down the State of Arkansas, a small town at a big bend caught our eye.</t3853> <t3854>About three-quarters of a mile above the town, we tied the raft at the mouth of a creek that seemed to flow through a tunnel because of the cypress trees, and then everyone except Jim got into the canoe and went to see if we could get a chance to perform our show.</t3854>
<t3855>Our luck had been very good; there was going to be a circus show in the town in the afternoon, and people from the surrounding areas had started coming in all sorts of shabby cars or on horseback.</t3855> <t3856>The circus would leave before evening, so the chances of our show being successful were quite high.</t3856> <t3857>The Duke rented the courthouse and we plastered our posters everywhere.</t3857> <t3858>The posters read as follows:</t3858>

<t3895>Just One Night</t3895>
<t3896>Admission 25 cents; for children and servants 10 cents.</t3896>
<t3897>Then we started wandering around the town.</t3897> <t3898>Almost all of the shops and houses were old, dilapidated, and had never seen a coat of paint.</t3898> <t3899>All the structures were raised about a meter above the ground on stilts, so they stayed in a place where the river couldn't reach when it flooded.</t3899> <t3900>There were tiny gardens around the houses, but it looked like nothing grew in them except weeds, sunflowers, piles of ash, old and misshapen boots and shoes, broken bottles, rags, and battered kitchenware.</t3900> <t3901>The fences were made by nailing different types of wood at different times; most were leaning forward or backward, and their gates usually had only a single hinge – which was made of leather straps.</t3901> <t3902>Some of the fences had once been painted white, but according to the duke, they were probably painted in Columbus's time.</t3902> <t3903>There were generally pigs in the gardens, and people were trying to get them out.</t3903>
<t3904>All the shops were gathered on a single street.</t3904> <t3905>In front of them were canopies made of white cloth, and the townspeople tied their horses to the poles of these canopies.</t3905> <t3906>Under the canopies, empty crates were piled up; vagrants lounged on these crates all day, carving notches into them with their knives; they chewed tobacco, yawned, and stretched – they were quite disreputable types.</t3906> <t3907>Most of them wore wide straw hats like umbrellas on their heads, but they had no jackets or vests; they called each other Bill, Buck, Hank, Joe, Andy, and so on; they spoke lazily and slowly and swore so much that it was grating on the ears.</t3907> <t3908>You could see a vagrant leaning against almost every canopy pole, and they only took their hands out of their pants pockets to take out tobacco or to scratch themselves.</t3908> <t3909>The conversations among them were almost always the same:</t3909>
<t3910>"Give me a chew of tobacco, will you, Hank."</t3910><t3911>"</t3911>
<t3912>“No way...</t3912> <t3913>There's only one chew left anyway.</t3913> <t3914>Ask Bill.</t3914><t3915>”</t3915>
<t3916>Maybe Bill was giving him a chew; or maybe he was lying and saying he had none left.</t3916> <t3917>Some drifters didn't have a single cent or any tobacco of their own.</t3917> <t3918>They borrowed all their tobacco – for example, one might say to someone, "Can you lend me a chew of tobacco, Jack, I just gave my last bit to Ben Thompson," but this was almost always a blatant lie; no one except strangers believed it; and Jack was no stranger...</t3918>
<t3919>“So you gave him tobacco, did you?</t3919> <t3920>I heard that your sister's cat's grandmother also gave some.</t3920> <t3921>First, return the tobacco you borrowed from me earlier, Lafe Buckner, then I'll give you a ton or two, and I won't even ask for anything in return.</t3921><t3922>”</t3922>
<t3923>“I had given back a part of the tobacco I took from you.</t3923><t3924>”</t3924>
<t3925>“You gave it, huh...</t3925> <t3926>You gave almost six chews.</t3926> <t3927>Oh, what a wonderful country!</t3927> <t3928>Buy from the beautiful store tobacco, pay your debt with the cheapest tobacco.</t3928><t3929>”</t3929>
<t3930>The store tobacco is in flat and black sheets; but these men usually chew twisted natural tobacco leaves.</t3930> <t3931>When borrowing chewing tobacco, they usually do not cut it with a knife; instead, they wedge the sheet between their teeth and gnaw it until it splits in two – then sometimes the owner of the tobacco looks at the returning piece with sorrow and says with bitter sarcasm:</t3931>
<t3932>"You give me the chewing tobacco and keep the case with you."</t3932><t3933>"</t3933>
<t3934>All the streets and alleys were filled with mud, in fact, there was nothing but mud – the mud was as black as tar, in some places it reached a depth of thirty centimeters, but generally, it was five to ten centimeters deep.</t3934> <t3935>Pigs were wandering idly everywhere, making grunting noises.</t3935> <t3936>You could see a sow in the mud lazily strolling down the street with her piglets; the pig would throw itself in the middle of the road, causing people to walk around it while it stretched, closed its eyes, and twitched its ears; it was as content as if it were on a salary while nursing its piglets where it lay.</t3936> <t3937>Soon, you would hear a loafer shout: "Catch it! Catch it, boy!</t3937> <t3938>Bite it, Karabaş!" The pig, with one or two dogs at its ear – other dogs about to join them – would start running away, screaming terribly; then you would see all the vagabonds standing up, watching the pig disappear, bursting into laughter, and thoroughly enjoying this commotion.</t3938> <t3939>Then they would return to their places until a dog fight occurred.</t3939> <t3940>Nothing rouses them all at once or makes them all happy like a dog fight – except perhaps pouring naphtha on a stray dog and setting it on fire or tying a pan to its tail and watching it run until it dies.</t3940>
<t3941>Some of the houses by the riverbank had given way towards the water, and it was only a matter of time before they rolled into the river.</t3941> <t3942>People had moved out of these houses.</t3942> <t3943>In some houses, the river had eroded the lower parts of certain corners, leaving these corners hanging in the air.</t3943> <t3944>People still lived in these houses, but it was a dangerous situation because sometimes a piece of land the size of a house would collapse.</t3944> <t3945>Sometimes a strip of land a quarter of a mile long would start to erode and mix into the water throughout the summer.</t3945> <t3946>A town like this was constantly receding, receding, receding; because the river was continuously gnawing at its edge.</t3946>
<t3947>As noon approached, the number of cars and horses on the streets increased, and new ones kept coming.</t3947> <t3948>Some families had brought their meals with them and were eating in their cars.</t3948> <t3949>There was plenty of whiskey being drunk, and I saw three separate fights break out.</t3949> <t3950>After a while, someone shouted:</t3950>
<t3951>“Here comes our Boggs!</t3951> <t3952>He has come out from his house in the countryside to get his monthly drink; there he is, gentlemen!</t3952><t3953>”</t3953>
<t3954>All the ruffians seemed pleased with Boggs' arrival; I thought they were used to mocking him.</t3954>
<t3955>"I wonder who he will threaten this time," said one of them.</t3955> <t3956>"If he had finished off everyone he threatened in the last twenty years, he would have gained an incredible reputation by now.</t3956><t3957>"</t3957>
<t3958>"I wish Boggs would threaten me this time," said another, "because then I would be sure to live another thousand years.</t3958><t3959>"</t3959>
<t3960>Boggs, charging full speed ahead, was shouting and occasionally yelling like the Natives:</t3960>
<t3961>“Get out of the way, I'm on the warpath, I'm going to skyrocket coffin prices!</t3961><t3962>”</t3962>
<t3963>He was dead drunk and swaying on the saddle; a man over fifty with an almost crimson face.</t3963> <t3964>Everyone was calling out to him, laughing, teasing, and he was responding to the taunts, saying he was taking note of everything and would deal with each of them in turn, but at that moment he had no time to wait, because he had come to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his golden rule was "eat the meat first, then go for the garnish."</t3964>
<t3965>When he saw me, he came to my side.</t3965>
<t3966>"Where did you come from, kid?</t3966> <t3967>Are you ready to kick the bucket?</t3967><t3968>"</t3968>
<t3969>Then he spurred his horse and left.</t3969> <t3970>I was scared, but a man called out to me:</t3970>
<t3971>“He won't do anything to you; he always says things like that when he's drunk.</t3971> <t3972>He's actually the sweetest man in Arkansas – he's never harmed anyone, whether drunk or sober.</t3972><t3973>”</t3973>
<t3974>Boggs rode his horse towards the largest store in town, bent his head to look inside from under the awning, and started shouting:</t3974>
<t3975>“Come out, Sherburn!</t3975> <t3976>Come out and face the man you swindled.</t3976> <t3977>You are the dog I'm after, and I will surely get you!</t3977><t3978>”</t3978>
<t3979>It went on like this, he said everything that came to his mouth to Sherburn, the whole street was packed with people listening to him and laughing, then going on their way.</t3979> <t3980>After a while, a proud-looking man in his mid-fifties – also undoubtedly the best-dressed man in town – came out of the store, the crowd parted to make way for him.</t3980> <t3981>He started talking to Boggs extremely calmly and deliberately:</t3981>
<t3982>“I am fed up with this, but I will still allow it until one o'clock.</t3982> <t3983>But until one o'clock... no more.</t3983> <t3984>If you say a single word against me after that hour, you'd better find a hole to hide in.</t3984><t3985>”</t3985>
<t3986>Then he turned around and went inside.</t3986> <t3987>The crowd suddenly became serious; no one moved, and no one was laughing anymore.</t3987> <t3988>Boggs turned his horse around and rode away, cursing Sherburn at the top of his lungs; he soon came back and continued his curses in front of the store.</t3988> <t3989>Some men gathered around him and tried to quiet him down, but he wouldn't listen to anyone; they were telling him that it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes, so he should go home – it would be better for him to leave as soon as possible.</t3989> <t3990>It was of no use.</t3990> <t3991>The man continued to shout and curse, threw his hat into the mud and trampled on it, and soon, with his gray hair flying, he galloped to the other end of the street.</t3991> <t3992>Everyone who could get through to him was trying to get him off his horse, so they could lock him up somewhere and wait for him to sober up; but it was no use – Boggs kept coming back and starting to curse Sherburn again.</t3992>
<t3993>Finally, someone said, "Go get his daughter!"</t3993> <t3994>"Hurry, inform his daughter; sometimes he listens to her.</t3994> <t3995>Only she can stop Boggs.</t3995><t3996>"</t3996>
<t3997>Someone else ran away.</t3997> <t3998>I also walked a bit further down the street and stopped.</t3998> <t3999>Five or ten minutes later, Boggs appeared again…</t3999> <t4000>but this time he wasn't on his horse.</t4000> <t4001>He was staggering towards me from across the street, his head was bare, and two friends had taken hold of his arms, trying to lead him away.</t4001> <t4002>Boggs had calmed down and looked quite distressed; he wasn't resisting them, on the contrary, he seemed to be in a hurry himself.</t4002> <t4003>I heard someone call out:</t4003>
<t4004>“Boggs!</t4004><t4005>”</t4005>
<t4006>When I turned my head to see the owner of the voice, I saw Colonel Sherburn.</t4006> <t4007>He was standing motionless in the middle of the street, holding his pistol in his right hand raised in the air – he wasn't aiming, the barrel of the gun was pointing upwards.</t4007> <t4008>At the same time, I saw a young girl running with two men beside her.</t4008> <t4009>Boggs and the men with him turned around to see who had called out, and when they saw the gun, the two men jumped to the sides.</t4009> <t4010>The barrel of the gun slowly lowered – Sherburn cocked the hammer.</t4010> <t4011>Boggs raised both his hands in the air, "Good God, don't shoot!" he said.</t4011> <t4012>Bam! The first gunshot was heard and Boggs staggered backward, clawing at the air – bam!</t4012> <t4013>The second gunshot was heard and Boggs fell backward like a log, his arms spread out to the sides, motionless.</t4013> <t4014>A young girl came running, screaming, and collapsed over her father's body, crying, "Oh, he killed him, he killed him!" she was screaming.</t4014> <t4015>The crowd formed a circle around them, pushing and elbowing each other to get in, craning their necks to see, while those on the inside were trying to push them back; "Step back!</t4015> <t4016>Step back, let him get some air!" they were shouting.</t4016>
<t4017>Colonel Sherburn threw his gun to the ground, turned back, and calmly walked away.</t4017>
<t4018>They took Boggs to a small pharmacy, the crowd around him had not diminished, the whole town was following him.</t4018> <t4019>I quickly moved and got a good spot by the window, I was close to him and could see inside.</t4019> <t4020>They laid him on the ground, placed a large Holy Bible under his head and another one on his chest – but first they tore open his shirt and I saw where one of the bullets had entered.</t4020> <t4021>As Boggs took deep breaths, the Holy Bible would rise and fall – then it became completely still; he was dead.</t4021> <t4022>Then they took his screaming and crying daughter away to another place.</t4022> <t4023>The girl was around sixteen years old, very sweet, she had an angelic face, but she had turned ashen and was in terror.</t4023>
<t4024>Before long, the whole town gathered there; they were pushing each other, squeezing through gaps, elbowing and shouldering their way to the window to try to look inside, but those who had secured good spots were not allowing them, and the ones at the back were calling out to those in front: "Alright gentlemen, you've looked enough, hey you; it's not right for you to stand there all the time, it's not fair either, you're not giving anyone else a chance to look, others have the right to stand there too.</t4024><t4025>"</t4025>
<t4026>When the shouting increased significantly, I slipped away for fear that trouble would break out.</t4026> <t4027>The streets were full of people and everyone was very excited.</t4027> <t4028>Those who saw the shooting were telling others what had happened, and large crowds were gathering around the storytellers, people were craning their necks to listen to them.</t4028> <t4029>A tall, lanky man with long hair and a top hat, carrying a cane with a curved handle, first marked the spot where Boggs stood, then the spot where Sherburn stood, and people followed him from the first spot to the second, watching everything he did; they nodded to show they understood; they leaned forward a bit and put their hands on their waists, watching him mark the ground with his cane; then the man stood upright where Sherburn had stood, furrowed his brows, tilted his hat slightly forward, and shouted "Boggs!" He slowly straightened his cane, which he had raised in the air, and said "Bang!" He staggered backward, said "Bang!" again, and fell on his back.</t4029> <t4030>Those who had witnessed the actual murder said he had done it flawlessly; the event had unfolded exactly like that.</t4030> <t4031>Then about ten men took out their liquor bottles and offered them to him.</t4031>
<t4032>Finally, someone said that Sherburn should be lynched.</t4032> <t4033>Within a minute, everyone started saying the same thing; thus, they began to walk, shouting and screaming like mad, taking all the clotheslines they could find to hang the man.</t4033>
<t4034>Chapter Twenty-Two</t4034>
<t4035>The crowd started moving towards Sherburn's house, shouting and screaming like Natives; everything in their path either moved aside or got trampled, it was a terrifying sight.</t4035> <t4036>When the children saw the crowd, they scattered like frightened chicks, screaming; women's heads popped out of every window along the way, and there were black boys in every tree, young girls and boys were watching over every fence; as the crowd approached them, they immediately fled to unreachable places.</t4036> <t4037>A lot of women and little girls, scared out of their wits, were crying and wailing.</t4037>
<t4038>The crowd squeezed tightly in front of Sherburn's fences, the noise was so loud that one couldn't even hear themselves speak.</t4038> <t4039>There was a small garden six meters wide in front of them.</t4039> <t4040>Some were heard shouting: "Tear down the fence!</t4040> <t4041>Tear it down!" Then creaks, snaps, and cracks were heard, the fence was torn down, and the front wall of the crowd began to move forward like a wave.</t4041>
<t4042>At that moment, Sherburn appeared on the roof of the small front porch and, without saying a word, stood over them very calmly and confidently, with a double-barreled shotgun in his hand.</t4042> <t4043>The commotion stopped and the wave receded.</t4043>
<t4044>Sherburn didn't say a word – he just stood there looking down at the people below.</t4044> <t4045>The silence was terrifyingly eerie and depressing.</t4045> <t4046>Sherburn was slowly scanning the crowd; wherever he looked, people tried to meet his gaze but couldn't; they all lowered their eyes and cowered.</t4046> <t4047>Soon after, Sherburn let out a laugh; it wasn't a joyful laugh, but one that felt like finding a stone in your bread.</t4047>
<t4048>Then, speaking slowly and with a condescending tone, he began:</t4048>
<t4049>“Thinking that you would lynch someone!</t4049> <t4050>How amusing.</t4050> <t4051>To think that you have the guts to lynch a man!</t4051> <t4052>Just because you are brave enough to tar and feather women who have no one and have been driven away, do you think you have the courage to lay a hand on a man?</t4052> <t4053>If it’s daytime and you don’t shoot him in the back, ten thousand of you couldn’t touch a single man.</t4053>
<t4054>Do I know you?</t4054> <t4055>I know you very well.</t4055> <t4056>I was born and raised in the South, lived in the North; so I know the average everywhere.</t4056> <t4057>The average man is a coward.</t4057> <t4058>In the North, he lets anyone ride on his back; then goes home and prays for a humble spirit to endure it.</t4058> <t4059>In the South, however, a single man once stopped a car full of men in broad daylight and stripped them all down to their underwear.</t4059> <t4060>Your newspapers say so many brave things about you that you think you are braver than others...</t4060> <t4061>But in reality, you are only as brave as others, no more.</t4061> <t4062>Why can't your juries hang murderers?</t4062> <t4063>Because they fear the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark – and indeed, the man's friends do exactly that.</t4063>
<t4064>That's why the killers always get acquitted; then a man, at night, takes a hundred masked cowards behind him and lynches the scoundrel.</t4064> <t4065>Your mistake was not bringing a man with you; that's your first mistake, and your other mistake was not coming in the dark and not wearing your masks.</t4065> <t4066>You brought a half-man with you...</t4066> <t4067>That Buck Harkness...</t4067> <t4068>If he hadn't stirred you up, you would have just worn out your jaws talking.</t4068>
<t4069>You didn't want to come.</t4069> <t4070>The average man does not like trouble and danger.</t4070> <t4071>Neither do you like trouble and danger.</t4071> <t4072>But when a half-man like Buck Harkness over there shouts 'Lynch him, lynch him!' you are afraid to stay behind...</t4072> <t4073>You fear being found out for what you are, you fear your cowardice being exposed, and so you start shouting too, clinging to the half-man's coattails, and come here in a rage, proclaiming you will do great things.</t4073> <t4074>There is nothing as pitiable as such a mob; an army is the same – a mob; they do not fight with their own courage, they fight with the courage they get from the mass and from their officers.</t4074> <t4075>But a mob without a man at its head is not even pitiable.</t4075> <t4076>Now what you should do is tuck your tails between your legs, go home, and crawl into a hole.</t4076> <t4077>If a real lynching is to be done, it is done in the dark, in the Southern style; but only if the crowd brings their masks and has a man with them.</t4077> <t4078>Now go...</t4078> <t4079>And take that excuse for a man with you...”</t4079> <t4080>As he said this, he placed the barrel of the shotgun over his left arm and cocked the hammer.</t4080>
<t4081>The crowd suddenly recoiled, scattering in different directions in a state of disarray, and Buck Harkness, with his spirit broken, scurried after them.</t4081> <t4082>I could have stayed if I wanted to, but I didn't want to stay.</t4082>
<t4083>I went to the circus from there, waited at the back until the guards disappeared from sight, then lifted a flap of the tent and slipped inside.</t4083> <t4084>I had twenty dollars in gold and some more money, but it was better not to spend it, because you never know how much money you might need when you're so far from home and among strangers.</t4084> <t4085>No matter how careful I was, it wasn't enough.</t4085> <t4086>I'm not against giving money to circuses if there's no other option, but there's no point in wasting money at the circuses either.</t4086>
<t4087>It was truly a wonderful circus.</t4087> <t4088>A woman and a man on horseback coming onto the stage two by two was a very magnificent sight.</t4088> <t4089>The men were only wearing their underwear and vests, they were barefoot and without stirrups, and they were comfortably going with their hands on their waists –there were probably about twenty of them– the ladies were also very beautiful with their magnificent skin and looked like queens who had come together for this event; they were wearing dresses worth millions of dollars and were adorned with sparkling diamonds.</t4089> <t4090>It was a very magnificent sight, I had never seen such a beautiful show.</t4090> <t4091>Then they stood up one by one on their horses and started drawing circles on the stage like monuments of elegance; the men were tall, very stylish, and upright; they looked very straight.</t4091> <t4092>Their heads, moving in waves, reached all the way to the tent ceiling.</t4092> <t4093>The women's rose-petaled, tulle silk dresses were gently swaying around their hips, you could liken them to magnificent parasols.</t4093>
<t4094>They were accelerating gradually, all of them dancing, lifting one foot and then the other into the air; the horses were also leaning more and more to the side, the announcer cracked his whip and circled around saying "Ha!..</t4094> <t4095>Ha!" and the clown was making jokes behind him; after a while, all the riders let go of the reins, all the ladies put their hands on their waists and the gentlemen crossed their arms over their chests, the horses were now leaning completely to the side and started running fast!</t4095> <t4096>Finally, the riders jumped onto the stage one by one, gave the most charming bow I've ever seen in my life, and quickly exited the stage as everyone applauded them wildly.</t4096>
<t4097>During the circus show, a lot of astonishing things were done, and in the meantime, the clown was making people laugh hysterically.</t4097><t4098>The host couldn't get a word in edgewise because the clown would come up with the funniest responses in the blink of an eye; I couldn't understand where he found so many words and how he said them so spontaneously.</t4098><t4099>Probably, even if I thought for forty years, those words wouldn't come to my mind.</t4099><t4100>A little later, a drunk guy tried to get on the stage...</t4100><t4101>He also wanted to ride a horse; he claimed he could ride as well as those there.</t4101><t4102>They opposed him and tried to stop him, but he wouldn't listen, and because of him, the show was interrupted.</t4102><t4103>People started to heckle and mock him, which made him even more furious, and he began to say whatever came to his mind.</t4103><t4104>Then the crowd got riled up, a bunch of men stood up and approached the stage, shouting, "Get him down!</t4104><t4105>Throw him off the stage!" and a few women screamed.</t4105><t4106>Upon this, the host made a short speech, saying he hoped no more disturbance would be caused, and if the man promised not to cause any more trouble, he could ride the horse, that is, if he could stay on it...</t4106><t4107>Everyone laughed and approved, and the man got on the horse.</t4107><t4108>As soon as the man mounted, the horse started to buck, rear, and kick; two circus men were holding the reins trying to calm it down, and the drunk man was clinging to the horse's neck, with his feet flying up with each jump; the audience was on their feet, shouting and laughing until tears streamed down their faces.</t4108><t4109>Finally, despite all the efforts of the circus workers, the horse broke free and started galloping around the stage like lightning; the drunk guy was clinging to its neck but had slipped to one side, his foot almost touching the ground, then he slipped to the other side, and again his foot almost touched the ground.</t4109><t4110>The people were getting more and more excited.</t4110><t4111>But to me, it wasn't funny at all; seeing how much danger he was in, I started to tremble.</t4111><t4112>But soon enough, the man managed to climb back into the saddle and grabbed the reins, pulling them left and right; then suddenly, he let go of the saddle and stood up on the horse's back!</t4112><t4113>The horse continued to run wildly as if there was a fire.</t4113><t4114>The man stood on its back, traveling quite comfortably and confidently as if he had never drunk in his life – then he started to take off and throw away his clothes.</t4114><t4115>He was dressed so thickly that clothes were everywhere, he had taken off and thrown a total of seventeen outfits.</t4115><t4116>In the end, he transformed into a slim and handsome man, wearing the most ornate and dazzling outfit you could ever see, he started whipping his horse, causing it to speed up – finally, he jumped off the horse's back, took a bow, and hopped and skipped towards the dressing rooms; everyone was howling with joy and amazement.</t4116>
<t4117>The host realized how he had been tricked, and suddenly became the angriest host you could ever see.</t4117> <t4118>So that drunk was one of his own men!</t4118> <t4119>He had completely designed this prank himself and hadn't said a word to anyone.</t4119> <t4120>Actually, I was feeling dazed myself, but honestly, I wouldn't want to be in the host's place even if they gave me a thousand dollars.</t4120> <t4121>I don't know; maybe there are more wonderful circuses than this; but I haven't come across one yet.</t4121> <t4122>Anyway, it was quite good for me; wherever I come across it again, I will definitely go again.</t4122>
<t4123>That night, we put on our own show, about twelve people came; we barely covered the expenses.</t4123> <t4124>Because they kept laughing, the duke went crazy; in fact, everyone left before the plays were even over, only one child stayed, and he had fallen asleep.</t4124> <t4125>Upon this, the duke said that these Arkansas blockheads didn't understand Shakespeare or anything; what they wanted was cheap comedy – they might even come for something worse than cheap comedy.</t4125> <t4126>He said he would play by their rules.</t4126> <t4127>The next morning, he got black paint and large wrapping papers, prepared new posters, and we put them up all over town.</t4127> <t4128>The poster said:</t4128>

<t4141>At the very bottom of the announcement, it was written in large letters:</t4141>
<t4142>WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE NOT ALLOWED.</t4142>
<t4143>“Here,” he said, “if this sentence doesn't bring them, then I don't know Arkansas!</t4143><t4144>”</t4144>
<t4145>Chapter Twenty-Three</t4145>
<t4146>The duke and the king worked all day to set up a stage, hung a curtain, and placed candles on the floor as footlights; that night, the courtroom was suddenly filled with men.</t4146><t4147>When the room could no longer accommodate anyone else, the duke stopped selling tickets, went around to the back, and came out on stage, standing in front of the curtain to give a small speech: He praised the tragedy, said it was the most breathtaking play to date; he talked a lot about the tragedy and the great Edmund Kean who would play the lead role; finally, after raising everyone's expectations to the highest level, he opened the curtain, and suddenly the king came out on all fours, naked, hopping around the stage; he was painted from head to toe, and with colorful stripes on him, he looked as magnificent as a rainbow.</t4147><t4148>Also... never mind the other things he was wearing, it was absolutely crazy, but at the same time, terribly funny.</t4148><t4149>People were almost dying of laughter; after the king finished hopping and jumping, he left the stage, a round of applause erupted from the crowd, and they kept clapping and cheering until the king came back; then they made him do it a third time.</t4149><t4150>Seeing that old fool's antics could make even an ox laugh.</t4150>
<t4151>After that, the duke lowered the curtain, bowed to the audience, and said that the great tragedy would be performed for only two more nights, as they needed to make it to the shows in London, where all the seats at Drury Lane had already been sold; after bowing and saluting once more, he mentioned that if he had succeeded in pleasing them and making them learn a lesson, he would be grateful if they shared their satisfaction with their friends and encouraged them to come and see it.</t4151>
<t4152>Twenty people shouted at the same time:</t4152>
<t4153>“Is it over?</t4153> <t4154>Is that all?</t4154><t4155>”</t4155>
<t4156>The Duke said that was all of them.</t4156> <t4157>Then a commotion broke out.</t4157> <t4158>Everyone jumped up angrily, shouting "we've been deceived," and tried to get on stage to demand an explanation from the actors.</t4158> <t4159>But a burly and well-dressed man jumped onto a seat and shouted:</t4159>
<t4160>“Stop! Look here, gentlemen.” They stopped and listened.</t4160> <t4161>“We were deceived…</t4161> <t4162>And we were deceived badly.</t4162> <t4163>But surely we don't want the whole town to laugh at us, they would keep mocking us until we die.</t4163> <t4164>No.</t4164> <t4165>What we need to do is quietly leave here, praise the show, and ensure the rest of the town gets deceived too!</t4165> <t4166>Then we will all be in the same boat.</t4166> <t4167>Am I wrong?” (“You are absolutely right…</t4167> <t4168>The judge is right!” they shouted in unison.</t4168><t4169>)</t4169> <t4170>“Alright then…</t4170> <t4171>No talking about being deceived.</t4171> <t4172>Go home and recommend everyone to come and watch the play.</t4172><t4173>”</t4173>
<t4174>The next day, the entire town was talking about nothing but how magnificent our show was.</t4174> <t4175>The hall was packed again, and we deceived this crowd in the same way.</t4175> <t4176>We returned to the raft with the king and the duke, ate together; towards midnight, they had Jim and me uncover the raft, and after reaching the middle of the river, they asked us to go about two miles down the town and hide it somewhere there.</t4176>
<t4177>The third night the hall was packed again – only this time there were no new arrivals, just those who had watched the show the previous two nights.</t4177> <t4178>While standing by the door next to the duke, I saw that everyone entering had bulging pockets or was hiding something under their coat – and these were definitely not pleasant-smelling things.</t4178> <t4179>I smelled rotten eggs, cabbage, and similar spoiled things; if I could smell the stench of dead cats around, which I certainly could, at least sixty-four of them had entered.</t4179> <t4180>I stood there a bit longer, but it was impossible for me to endure such variety for long.</t4180> <t4181>Once the inside was so full that no one else could fit, the duke handed a man a quarter and asked him to watch the door for a minute, then headed towards the stage door, and I followed him; but as soon as we turned the corner and entered the darkness, he said:</t4181>
<t4182>“Now walk quickly until you are far from the houses, then run as if the devil is chasing you to reach the mosque!</t4182><t4183>”</t4183>
<t4184>I did as he said, and he was beside me.</t4184> <t4185>We reached the hall at the same time, and within two seconds, we were drifting in the dark in silence, slowly moving towards the middle of the river; no one said a word.</t4185> <t4186>I thought the poor king would have a very colorful evening with the spectators; but I was very wrong; he came out of the shelter a little later.</t4186>
<t4187>“So, did the old trick work again, Duke?” he asked.</t4187>
<t4188>He hadn't even come to the town.</t4188>
<t4189>We didn't light any lamps until we passed the town by ten miles.</t4189> <t4190>Then we made a fire and ate our meal, while the king and the duke were almost bursting with laughter as they talked about the trick they played on the spectators.</t4190>
<t4191>“Inexperienced rookies; suckers!</t4191> <t4192>I knew that the first viewers would stay silent and bring the rest of the town, and I also predicted that on the third night they would set a trap for us and think that it was finally their turn.</t4192> <t4193>Yes, it is their turn now, but I would love to see the look on their faces.</t4193> <t4194>Who knows how long they had been waiting for this opportunity.</t4194> <t4195>Now they can turn it into a picnic...</t4195> <t4196>After all, they have plenty of supplies with them.</t4196><t4197>”</t4197>
<t4198>Our rascals had collected four hundred sixty-five dollars in three nights.</t4198> <t4199>I had never seen money being taken in such large amounts before.</t4199>
<t4200>After a while, both of them fell into a deep sleep.</t4200> <t4201>While they were snoring, Jim asked:</t4201>
<t4202>“Doesn't it surprise you that the king lives like this, Huck?”</t4202>
<t4203>"Yoo," I said, "it doesn't surprise me at all.</t4203><t4204>"</t4204>
<t4205>“How could it not surprise you, Huck?”</t4205>
<t4206>“Because it's in their blood.</t4206> <t4207>I guess they all come from the same mold.</t4207><t4208>”</t4208>
<t4209>“But Huck, our kings are outright swindlers; there's no other way to put it, they are plain swindlers.</t4209><t4210>”</t4210>
<t4211>“That's exactly what I'm saying; as far as I understand, all kings are scoundrels.</t4211><t4212>”</t4212>
<t4213>"Is that so?</t4213><t4214>"</t4214>
<t4215>"If you had read what was written about them, you would understand.</t4215><t4216>Look at Henry the Eighth; compared to him, ours are considered angels.</t4216><t4217>Is Charles the Second, Louis the Fourteenth, Louis the Fifteenth, James the Second, Edward the Second, Richard the Third, and forty others any different; especially the seven Saxon kings who wreaked havoc and caused chaos in ancient times.</t4217><t4218>You should see Henry the Eighth in his youth.</t4218><t4219>The man was out of his mind.</t4219><t4220>He married a new woman every day and beheaded her in the morning.</t4220><t4221>He did this as indifferently as ordering eggs for breakfast.</t4221><t4222>'Bring Nell Gwynn,' he would say.</t4222><t4223>They would bring her.</t4223><t4224>In the morning, he would say 'Behead her!' and they would behead the girl.</t4224><t4225>'Bring Jane Shore,' he would say, and the girl would be brought.</t4225><t4226>In the morning, 'Behead her' – the girl's head would be gone.</t4226><t4227>'Knock on Fair Rosamund's door.' They would go to Fair Rosamund's door and bring the girl.</t4227><t4228>The next morning, 'Behead her.'</t4228><t4229>He also had the girls tell him a story every night; he kept these stories and eventually collected a thousand and one stories, then compiled them into a book and called it the Book of Doom...</t4229><t4230>A very fitting name and it summarizes the situation well.</t4230><t4231>You don't know kings, Jim, but I do; these scoundrels of ours are the cleanest I've seen in history.</t4231><t4232>For instance, Henry decided to get this country into trouble.</t4232><t4233>Do you know what he did, did he give a warning, did he threaten?</t4233><t4234>No.</t4234><t4235>He suddenly dumped all the tea in Boston Harbor into the sea, made up a declaration of independence, and said come on if you dare.</t4235><t4236>That was his style...</t4236><t4237>He gave no one a chance.</t4237><t4238>He even suspected his own father, the Duke of Wellington.</t4238><t4239>So what did he do?</t4239><t4240>Did he ask him for an explanation?</t4240><t4241>No, he stuffed him into a barrel and drowned him like a kitten.</t4241><t4242>Let's say people left money lying around in public, do you know what he would do?</t4242><t4243>He would take it without hesitation.</t4243><t4244>Let's say you made a contract with him for a job; you paid him and didn't watch how he did the job...</t4244><t4245>Guess what he would do!</t4245><t4246>The exact opposite of what he was told.</t4246><t4247>Let's say he opened his mouth...</t4247><t4248>What do you think would happen then?</t4248><t4249>If he didn't shut his mouth quickly, he would tell a lie every time.</t4249><t4250>Henry was such a pest, and if he were with us instead of our kings, he would swindle the townspeople much worse than ours.</t4250><t4251>I'm not claiming that ours are innocent lambs, because the truth is, they aren't.</t4251><t4252>But compared to that old goat Henry, they are nothing.</t4252><t4253>All I want to say is, a king is a king, and you should always keep that in mind.</t4253><t4254>When you look at the lot of them, you understand that they are all quite vile.</t4254><t4255>It all stems from their upbringing.</t4255><t4256>"</t4256>
<t4257>"But ours smells really bad, Huck."</t4257><t4258></t4258>
<t4259>“They all smell like that, Jim.</t4259> <t4260>We can't find a remedy for a king's smell; there's no example of this in history.</t4260><t4261>”</t4261>
<t4262>“Although he is a more tolerable man.</t4262><t4263>”</t4263>
<t4264>“Yes, dukes are a bit different.</t4264> <t4265>But they are not very different either.</t4265> <t4266>Ours can be considered average for a duke.</t4266> <t4267>When you're drunk, it's easy to mistake him for a king unless you have eagle eyes.</t4267><t4268>”</t4268>
<t4269>"Well anyway, I don't want to see or know any more, Huck.</t4269> <t4270>I can barely stand this much.</t4270><t4271>"</t4271>
<t4272>"Ask me too, Jim.</t4272> <t4273>But now they can't be thrown away or sold; besides, we must remember what they are and act accordingly.</t4273> <t4274>I hope we can live in a country without a king one day.</t4274><t4275>"</t4275>
<t4276>What would be the point of telling Jim that they weren't real kings and dukes?</t4276> <t4277>It would be useless, and besides, as I said, what was there to distinguish them from real kings?</t4277>
<t4278>I went to bed and slept, and Jim didn't wake me when it was my turn for watch.</t4278> <t4279>He does this often.</t4279> <t4280>When I woke up at dawn, he was sitting with his head buried between his knees, moaning and lamenting to himself.</t4280> <t4281>I didn't dwell on it much.</t4281> <t4282>I knew the reason.</t4282> <t4283>He was thinking about his wife and children far away; he was feeling down and homesick because he had never been away from home before; and, if you ask me, he was as attached to his family as white folks are to theirs.</t4283> <t4284>At first, it didn't seem natural, but I guess it was quite natural.</t4284> <t4285>Often, during the nights when he thought I was asleep, he would moan and continue his lament: “Poor little Elizabeth! Poor little Johnny! What a hard thing this is.</t4285> <t4286>Will I never see you again, ever?”</t4286> <t4287>Our Jim was truly a good black man.</t4287>
<t4288>But this time I started talking to him about his wife and children; soon his tongue loosened:</t4288>
<t4289>“This time I felt very bad, because I heard a voice, as if someone was beating a child from the shore.</t4289> <t4290>It reminded me of how badly I had treated my little Elizabeth in a cradle.</t4290> <t4291>She was only four years old and was having a high fever, there was a very bad spell on her; but later she recovered and one day she was wandering in the middle of the room.</t4291> <t4292>To her,</t4292>
<t4293>‘Close the door,’ I called out.</t4293>
<t4294>The child did nothing, just stood there and smiled at me.</t4294> <t4295>I got annoyed, this time I shouted louder: ‘Can't you hear me?</t4295> <t4296>Open the door!</t4296><t4297>’</t4297>
<t4298>He didn't move again and smiled innocently.</t4298> <t4299>I got really angry!</t4299>
<t4300>‘Now I'll show you!’ I said.</t4300>
<t4301>Then I slapped him hard in the middle of his back, the boy clung to the wall.</t4301> <t4302>Then I went inside and stayed inside for about ten minutes; when I came out, the door was still open.</t4302> <t4303>The poor boy was standing in the same place, head bowed, crying softly.</t4303> <t4304>This time I went completely mad, just as I was about to slap him again, a sudden gust of wind slammed the door shut with a bang from behind, but the boy didn't even flinch!</t4304> <t4305>My eyes widened in astonishment...</t4305> <t4306>I felt terrible...</t4306> <t4307>I can't even describe that feeling.</t4307> <t4308>My face turned pale, and without showing it, I slowly moved behind the boy.</t4308> <t4309>Then, when I was sure he wasn't looking at me, I got close to his ear and suddenly shouted: He didn't even move a muscle, poor thing! Ah, Huck, that's when I started crying too, I took him in my arms and said, 'Oh, my poor child!'</t4309> <t4310>Dear Lord, forgive big Jim, because Jim will never forgive himself!</t4310> <t4311>Ah, my daughter was deaf and mute, Huck, she couldn't hear or speak...</t4311> <t4312>But what did I do to her!</t4312><t4313>"</t4313>
<t4314>Chapter Twenty-Four</t4314>
<t4315>Before dark the next day, we docked at a small island covered with poplars in the middle of the river; there was a town on each bank of the river, and the duke and the king began to plan what they would do in the towns.</t4315> <t4316>Meanwhile, Jim chimed in and said he hoped their business wouldn't take more than a few hours, because lying tied up inside the shelter was both very difficult and tiring.</t4316> <t4317>When we left the raft, we had to tie him up, because if someone saw him free, we could never convince anyone that he wasn't a captured runaway black man.</t4317> <t4318>The duke also admitted that keeping him tied up all day was really hard and said he would look for another solution.</t4318>
<t4319>Our duke was an extraordinarily clever man, and he soon found a way.</t4319> <t4320>He dressed Jim in a King Lear costume – this costume consisted of a long robe made from curtain fabric, a wig made of white horsehair, and sideburns; then he took the theater paints and painted Jim's face, hands, ears, and neck a dull blue color; in this state, Jim looked like someone who had drowned nine days ago.</t4320> <t4321>Honestly, I had never seen such a horrifying sight.</t4321> <t4322>The duke also prepared a sign from a piece of wood and wrote on it:</t4322>
<t4323>Crazy Arab – but he is harmless when he's in his right mind.</t4323>
<t4324>He nailed the sign to a stick and planted the stick a meter or two in front of the shelter.</t4324> <t4325>Jim was pleased.</t4325> <t4326>He said it was better to look like this than to lie tied up for several years a day and tremble at every sound he heard.</t4326> <t4327>The Duke told him to act very freely and comfortably, and if someone came there, all he had to do was get out of the shelter and do some crazy things, howl like a wild animal once or twice.</t4327> <t4328>Most likely, they would immediately flee and leave him alone.</t4328> <t4329>This idea seemed quite reasonable, but if you think about the average person, they probably wouldn't stay there long enough to wait for him to howl.</t4329> <t4330>Because Jim not only looked like he was dead, he had a much more frightening appearance.</t4330>
<t4331>Our swindlers tried the Curcuna trick again, because there was a lot of money in it, but they didn't find it safe enough; perhaps the news had already reached here from the upper town.</t4331> <t4332>They couldn't come up with a plan that was perfectly suitable for here; finally, the duke said he would lie down for a couple of hours and try to come up with something that would fit this Arkansas town exactly.</t4332> <t4333>The king decided to take a short trip to the town across the way.</t4333> <t4334>He didn't have any plan, but he believed that the Creator would lead him to a profitable business...</t4334> <t4335>By the Creator, he probably meant the devil.</t4335> <t4336>At our last stop, we all got some clothes from a store; the king put on his new clothes and told me to put on mine too.</t4336> <t4337>Of course, I did what he said immediately.</t4337> <t4338>The king, dressed entirely in black, had become a very dignified man.</t4338> <t4339>I could never have guessed that clothes could change a person so much.</t4339> <t4340>Previously, it was obvious from a thousand meters away that he was a lowlife, but now, when he took off his new white hat, bowed slightly, and smiled, he looked so important, kind-hearted, and pious that you might think he had just stepped off Noah's Ark or was old Leviticus himself.</t4340> <t4341>Jim prepared the canoe, and I adjusted the oars.</t4341> <t4342>There was a large steamboat anchored about three miles up the town – it had been loading cargo there for a few hours.</t4342>
<t4343>“If we look at my outfit,” said the king, “it's probably best that I came from a big place like St.</t4343> <t4344>Louis or Cincinnati.</t4344> <t4345>Let's go to the steamboat, Huckleberry; we'll go to town on that boat.</t4345><t4346>”</t4346>
<t4347>I had no intention of disobeying this order; I grabbed the oar and we moved towards the steamer.</t4347> <t4348>I reached the shore about half a mile above the town, then climbed up the rocky shore in relatively calm waters.</t4348> <t4349>Soon, we came across a man who looked pleasant and innocent, sitting on a log and wiping his sweat, as it was very hot; he had a few large bags with him.</t4349>
<t4350>“Stick the cannon's nose in,” said the king.</t4350> <t4351>I did as he said.</t4351> <t4352>“Where are you going, young man?</t4352><t4353>”</t4353>
<t4354>“I will take the steamer.</t4354> <t4355>I am going to Orleans.</t4355><t4356>”</t4356>
<t4357>“Let's see,” said the king.</t4357> <t4358>“Wait a second, let my servant help you with your bags.</t4358> <t4359>Go ashore and help the gentleman, Adolphus.”</t4359> <t4360>He had said this to me.</t4360>
<t4361>I did what he said, then the three of us continued on our way.</t4361> <t4362>The young man was grateful; he said that carrying so much stuff in this weather was a terrible job.</t4362> <t4363>He asked the king where he was going, and the king said he had come from down the river and had landed in the other town that morning; he was going to see an old friend at a farm a few miles further up.</t4363>
<t4364>“When I first saw you,” said the young man, “I said to myself, ‘This is definitely Mr. Wilks, which means he almost made it here.’</t4364> <t4365>But then I thought again, ‘No, it can't be Mr. Wilks, because he is coming upriver.’</t4365> <t4366>You are not Mr. Wilks, are you?</t4366><t4367>”</t4367>
<t4368>“No, my name is Blodgett –Elexander Blodgett– Reverend Elexander Blodgett, to be more precise, for I am one of God's humble servants.</t4368> <t4369>But still, I am saddened that Mr. Wilks could not arrive on time, I wish he could have made it but...</t4369> <t4370>I wonder what he missed?</t4370><t4371>”</t4371>
<t4372>“Of course, he didn't lose his property, because he will take them all; but he couldn't see his brother Peter one last time before he died...</t4372> <t4373>Maybe he didn't care about this; no one can know for sure...</t4373> <t4374>But he would have given everything to see his brother before he died; for three weeks he talked about nothing but his brothers; he hadn't seen them since childhood...</t4374> <t4375>In fact, he had never seen his brother William...</t4375> <t4376>William was deaf and mute...</t4376> <t4377>He must have been around thirty or at most thirty-five years old.</t4377> <t4378>The only ones who came here were Peter and George; George was the one who was married; last year both he and his wife passed away.</t4378> <t4379>Now only Harvey and William are left, but as I said, they couldn't come in time either.</t4379><t4380>”</t4380>
<t4381>“Were they notified?</t4381><t4382>”</t4382>
<t4383>“Of course, word was sent a month or two ago, that is, when Peter first took to his bed; because Peter had said that this time he felt he would never get up again.</t4383> <t4384>Truth be told, he was quite old, and George's daughters were too young to take good care of him, except for red-haired Mary Jane; so when George and his wife died, Peter became very lonely and didn't seem to want to live any longer.</t4384> <t4385>He very, very much wanted to see Harvey – and also William – because he was a man who didn't like dealing with wills.</t4385> <t4386>He had left a letter for Harvey, detailing where the money was hidden and how he wanted the properties to be distributed among George's daughters – because George had left nothing behind.</t4386> <t4387>The only thing they could get him to do was to dictate this letter.</t4387><t4388>”</t4388>
<t4389>“I wonder why Harvey didn't come?</t4389> <t4390>Where does he live?</t4390><t4391>”</t4391>
<t4392>“He lives in Sheffield, England…</t4392> <t4393>He works as a priest there…</t4393> <t4394>He has never been to this country before.</t4394> <t4395>He didn't have enough time…</t4395> <t4396>It is even possible that he never received the letter.</t4396><t4397>”</t4397>
<t4398>“How terrible, it's so sad that he passed away without seeing his brothers, poor man.</t4398> <t4399>You're going to Orleans, aren't you?</t4399><t4400>”</t4400>
<t4401>“Yes, but going there is just the beginning.</t4401> <t4402>We need to go to Rio de Janeiro, where my uncle lives, next Wednesday.</t4402><t4403>”</t4403>
<t4404>"It's a very long road.</t4404> <t4405>But it is very enjoyable; I wish I could have come too.</t4405> <t4406>Is Mary Jane the eldest?</t4406> <t4407>How old was she?</t4407><t4408>"</t4408>
<t4409>“Mary Jane is nineteen years old, Susan is fifteen, and Joanna is fourteen – the one who devotes herself to charity and has a harelip is named Joanna.</t4409><t4410>”</t4410>
<t4411>"Poor things!</t4411> <t4412>They have been left all alone in this cruel world.</t4412><t4413>"</t4413>
<t4414>"Their situation could have been worse.</t4414> <t4415>Old Peter had friends and they wouldn't let anything happen to those left behind.</t4415> <t4416>Baptist preacher Hobson, assistant pastor Lot Hovey, Ben Rucker; Abner Shackleford and lawyer Levi Bell; Doctor Robinson and all their wives, widow Mrs. Bartley and...</t4416> <t4417>there are so many; though these were the closest to Peter; he would write about them from time to time; so that when Harvey came here, he would know who his friends were.</t4417><t4418>"</t4418>
<t4419>Anyway, the old man kept asking questions until he learned everything the young man knew.</t4419> <t4420>He asked about everyone and everything in that town; he learned everything about the Wilks; he learned everything about Peter, who was a tanner; he learned everything about George, who was a carpenter; he also learned about Harvey, who was a dissident preacher; and it went on like this.</t4420> <t4421>Finally, he asked the young man:</t4421>
<t4422>“Why did you walk so far up to board the steamboat?</t4422><t4423>”</t4423>
<t4424>“Because a large Orleans ship will come, I fear it may not stop here.</t4424> <t4425>If it has a heavy load, it will leave without a moment's hesitation.</t4425> <t4426>If it were a Cincinnati ship, it would stop, but this is a St Louis ship.</t4426><t4427>”</t4427>
<t4428>“Was Peter Wilks well-off?</t4428><t4429>”</t4429>
<t4430>“Yes, and how.</t4430> <t4431>He had houses and land, and it is also said that he hid three to four thousand dollars in cash somewhere.</t4431><t4432>”</t4432>
<t4433>“When did you say they died?</t4433><t4434>”</t4434>
<t4435>“I hadn't mentioned it, but he died last night.</t4435><t4436>”</t4436>
<t4437>“The funeral is probably tomorrow, right?</t4437><t4438>”</t4438>
<t4439>“Yes, it will be done around noon.</t4439><t4440>”</t4440>
<t4441>“How sad; but one day, it will be all of our turns.</t4441> <t4442>So the only thing we can do is to be ready; then we can go with peace of mind.</t4442><t4443>”</t4443>
<t4444>"Yes, sir, this is the best."</t4444> <t4445>My mother always used to say that too.</t4445><t4446>"</t4446>
<t4447>When we caught the ship, it had almost finished loading and was about to set off.</t4447> <t4448>The king didn't say anything about going on deck, so I couldn't board.</t4448> <t4449>After the ship left, he made me row up to a deserted place a mile away, then he went ashore.</t4449>
<t4450>“Now go back to the ferry immediately and bring the duke here,” he said.</t4450> <t4451>“He should also bring the new kilim-bags.</t4451> <t4452>If he has gone to the neighboring town, you follow him and find him.</t4452> <t4453>Tell him to leave everything and come.</t4453> <t4454>Come on, put your back into it.</t4454><t4455>”</t4455>
<t4456>I had understood what his intention was, but of course, I didn't say anything.</t4456> <t4457>When I came back with the Duke, we hid the canoe, then they sat on a log and the king told him everything just as the same young man had said – without skipping a single word.</t4457> <t4458>Moreover, while telling, he was trying to speak like an Englishman; he did the imitation quite well, at least for someone as lazy as him.</t4458> <t4459>It's not possible for me to explain how he did it by writing, so I won't even try; but he really did it well.</t4459>
<t4460>“How good are you at playing the deaf-mute, Bridgewater?” he said.</t4460>
<t4461>The Duke said, "You can leave this to me"; he had played the role of a deaf-mute on the theater stage.</t4461> <t4462>After that, they started waiting for the steamboat.</t4462>
<t4463>Towards the afternoon, a few small ships came and went, but they weren't far enough upstream.</t4463> <t4464>Finally, a big one appeared, and the duke and the king waved to it.</t4464> <t4465>A dinghy was sent from the ship, and we went aboard; the ship was from Cincinnati. When they learned that we only wanted to go four or five miles, they went crazy; they cursed and said they wouldn't take us.</t4465> <t4466>But the king, without losing his composure, said:</t4466>
<t4467>“If gentlemen pay one dollar per mile to be picked up and dropped off by lifeboat, steamships can carry them; isn't that so?</t4467><t4468>”</t4468>
<t4469>Upon this, they softened and said there was no longer a problem, and when we reached the town, they brought us ashore with a lifeboat.</t4469> <t4470>When they saw the lifeboat coming, about two dozen men came to the shore.</t4470>
<t4471>When the king said to them, "Gentlemen, can you tell me where Mr. Peter Wilks lives?" they first looked at each other and nodded as if to say, "Didn't I tell you?"</t4471> <t4472>One of them answered politely and softly:</t4472>
<t4473>“I'm sorry, sir, but the best thing we can do for you is to tell you where he was staying last night.</t4473><t4474>”</t4474>
<t4475>Our old rascal suddenly shook as if he had been struck, collapsed onto the man, rested his chin on his shoulder, and began crying towards his back:</t4475>
<t4476>“Ah, what a pity, what a pity, my poor brother...</t4476> <t4477>He passed away and we didn't get the chance to see him; oh, how terrible, how terrible!</t4477><t4478>”</t4478>
<t4479>Then, amidst sobs, he turned his back and made a bunch of silly gestures at the duke with his hands.</t4479> <t4480>The duke also dropped the bag he was holding and started to cry.</t4480> <t4481>If I have ever seen men as skilled at their job as these two swindlers, may I be damned.</t4481>
<t4482>Anyway, the men gathered around them and said all sorts of things to console them.</t4482> <t4483>They carried their bags uphill; they let them cry on their shoulders and told the king everything about his brother's last moments. The king then conveyed all of this to the duke using hand gestures, and both of them lamented for the dead undertaker. Anyone who saw them would think they were mourning the twelve apostles.</t4483> <t4484>If I have seen anything like this in my life, let me be a black man.</t4484> <t4485>As I watched them, I was ashamed of my humanity.</t4485>
<t4486>Chapter Twenty-Five</t4486>
<t4487>The news spread throughout the town in two minutes; I could see people running from all directions, some even trying to put on their jackets while running.</t4487> <t4488>Soon we were in the middle of the crowd, moving with as much noise as a regiment of soldiers.</t4488> <t4489>The windows and doorways were filled with people; I could see the same words being repeated over and over from over the fences:</t4489>
<t4490>"Them?"</t4490><t4491>"</t4491>
<t4492>One of those walking within the crowd was answering:</t4492>
<t4493>“Of course, they are.</t4493><t4494>”</t4494>
<t4495>When we arrived in front of the house, the street was so crowded you couldn't drop a needle, and three girls were waiting for us at the door.</t4495> <t4496>Mary Jane was the red-haired one, but it didn't matter, because she was the most strikingly beautiful; her face and eyes seemed to be illuminated by a divine light, and she appeared very pleased that her uncles had arrived.</t4496> <t4497>The King opened his arms and Mary Jane threw herself into them, the hare-lipped one threw herself into the Duke's arms, and they all reunited with great affection!</t4497> <t4498>Not only the women, but almost everyone cried with joy at their eventual reunion and happiness.</t4498>
<t4499>Then the king discreetly nudged the duke with his elbow – but I saw it – then he looked around and saw the coffin placed between two chairs; upon this, the king and the duke put one arm around each other's shoulders and, wiping their eyes with the other arm, they slowly and solemnly walked towards the coffin.</t4499> <t4500>Everyone stepped back to make way for them, all conversations and noises ceased; people were saying "Shh!" to each other and all the men took off their hats and bowed their heads; you could hear a pin drop.</t4500> <t4501>Our guys reached the head of the coffin, bent over and looked inside, looked again, and then started crying so loudly that you could hear them from Orleans; they put their hands on each other's necks; rested their chins on each other's shoulders; for the next three, even four minutes, they shed more tears than I had ever seen before.</t4501> <t4502>Moreover, everyone else was also bawling their eyes out.</t4502> <t4503>It was the first time I had seen a place get so damp.</t4503> <t4504>Then one of them went to one side of the coffin, the other to the other side, knelt down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and began to pray silently.</t4504> <t4505>This had a strange effect on the crowd that I had never seen before, everyone's hearts were broken and they started crying loudly – the poor girls were crying too.</t4505> <t4506>Almost all the women headed towards where the girls were, without saying anything, they kissed them on the forehead with great seriousness; placed their hands on their heads and turned their tear-filled eyes upwards, then they too started sobbing and wiping their eyes; they left their place to the next woman.</t4506> <t4507>I had never seen anything so nauseating, honestly.</t4507>
<t4508>After a while, the king stood up, walked a bit forward, composed himself, and began to deliver a slobbering speech, babbling amidst his tears; he talked about how losing the deceased and not being able to see him alive after a long journey of four thousand miles was a painful trial for both himself and his poor brother; but because their sorrows were shared so sincerely and holy tears were shed, it was a sweet and blessed trial; therefore, he was deeply thankful on behalf of both himself and his brother, as words could not express their gratitude because words were too weak and cold; he went on and on with such absurdly emotional things until it made me feel nauseous; then he concluded with a pious but insincere Amen, suddenly relaxed, and started sobbing uncontrollably again.</t4508>
<t4509>As soon as these last words left his mouth, someone in the crowd began a hymn of gratitude and everyone joined in, shouting at the top of their lungs; this hymn warmed the heart and made one feel good, like when a church service ends.</t4509> <t4510>Music is a good thing; after all that spiritual flattery and nonsense, everything felt fresh, and the surroundings were filled with the grandeur of honesty.</t4510>
<t4511>Then the king's jaw started working again; the family's main friends would join them for dinner that evening and would not leave them alone with the ashes of the deceased; he and his nephews would be very pleased if they did so. Moreover, if his poor brother lying there could speak, he would tell who these friends were, as these names were very valuable to him and he often mentioned them in his letters; therefore, he would name these friends as best as he could remember: Reverend Hobson, assistant pastor Lot Hovey, Mr. Ben Rucker, Abner Shackleford, Levi Bell, Dr. Robinson and their wives, and the widow Mrs. Bartley.</t4511>
<t4512>Reverend Hobson and Dr. Robinson had "gone hunting" on the other side of town; that is, the doctor was sending a sick man to the other world and the reverend was ensuring he didn't lose his way.</t4512> <t4513>Lawyer Bell had gone to Louisville for some business.</t4513> <t4514>But the rest were there; each one came up and shook the king's hand, expressed their thanks, exchanged a few words; then they shook hands with the duke and, without saying anything, just smiled while the duke made various gestures with his hands and said "Uuu-uuu – uuu-uuu-uuu" like a baby who couldn't speak, and they nodded their heads like fools.</t4514>
<t4515>Upon this, the king started rambling again and asked how almost every person and dog in the town was, mentioning many things that had happened in the town, to George's family, or to Peter's family; he also repeatedly stated that Peter had written all this to him, but this was a complete lie, because he had learned it all from the young fish we had taken by canoe to the steamboat.</t4515>
<t4516>Mary Jane brought the letter left by her father, and the king read it aloud and cried.</t4516> <t4517>According to the letter, the house they lived in and three thousand dollars in gold were left to the girls, the tannery (which was doing quite well), the other houses, lands (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold were left to Harvey and William; it also specified where in the cellar the six thousand dollars were hidden.</t4517> <t4518>Our two conmen said they would go and get the gold and make everything complete and clear, then they asked me to take a lantern and follow them.</t4518> <t4519>We closed the cellar door behind us; when they found the bag, they emptied its contents onto the floor, and those glittering gold coins made a magnificent sight.</t4519> <t4520>I was astonished to see how the king's eyes sparkled!</t4520> <t4521>He gave the duke a pat on the shoulder with his palm.</t4521>
<t4522>"Now, if this isn't what I call hitting the jackpot, then what is!"</t4522> <t4523>"Wow! This beats our Curcuna by a mile, doesn't it, Bridgewater?"</t4523><t4524></t4524>
<t4525>The duke agreed with him.</t4525> <t4526>They were grabbing the gold coins and then pouring them back onto the pile.</t4526>
<t4527>“No need for more words,” said the king.</t4527> <t4528>“For both you and me, Bridgewater, the best way is to be the representatives of the heirs left behind by the brothers of a wealthy dead man.</t4528> <t4529>If you take refuge in the Creator, this is how your fortune turns.</t4529> <t4530>In the long run, this is also the best.</t4530> <t4531>Believe me, I have tried everything, this is truly the best.</t4531><t4532>”</t4532>
<t4533>Anyone else would have been satisfied with the appearance of this pile and wouldn't have felt the need to count it; but no, they absolutely had to count it.</t4533> <t4534>They sat down and counted it one by one and saw that four hundred and fifteen dollars were missing.</t4534>
<t4535>“That accursed man,” said the king.</t4535> <t4536>“What did he do with that four hundred and fifteen dollars, I wonder?</t4536><t4537>”</t4537>
<t4538>For a while, they anxiously turned everything upside down looking for the remaining money.</t4538> <t4539>Finally, the duke thought of something else:</t4539>
<t4540>“Adam is very sick, he probably made a calculation error...</t4540> <t4541>It can't be any other way.</t4541> <t4542>It's best if we stop searching and keep quiet.</t4542> <t4543>We can manage this much.”</t4543>
<t4544>“Of course, we'll manage somehow.</t4544> <t4545>I'm not thinking about that...</t4545> <t4546>What really worries me is what we'll do when the money is being counted.</t4546> <t4547>We need to be completely thorough, open, and honest here.</t4547> <t4548>We have to take all this money upstairs and count it in front of everyone...</t4548> <t4549>Then no one will suspect anything.</t4549> <t4550>But when the dead man says there's six thousand dollars here and we count...</t4550><t4551>”</t4551>
<t4552>“Wait a minute,” said the duke.</t4552> <t4553>“Let's make up the difference.”</t4553> <t4554>Then he began to take out more gold from his pocket.</t4554>
<t4555>“This is a brilliant idea, duke…</t4555> <t4556>You are truly a very clever man,” said the king.</t4556> <t4557>“Our Jester has come to our rescue again, do you see,” – he also started adding the gold coins from his pocket to the pile.</t4557>
<t4558>They almost ran out of money, but they managed to come up with six thousand dollars.</t4558>
<t4559>“I have another idea,” said the duke.</t4559> <t4560>“Let's go upstairs and count the money, then give it all to the girls.</t4560><t4561>”</t4561>
<t4562>“You thought very well, duke, let me give you a hug!</t4562> <t4563>This is the brightest idea that could come to a man's mind.</t4563> <t4564>Truly, you have the most astonishing intelligence I have ever seen.</t4564> <t4565>I have never seen such a great scheme, it has definitely become perfect now.</t4565> <t4566>Let's see someone get up and suspect us, after this move, no mountain can stand in our way.</t4566><t4567>”</t4567>
<t4568>When we went upstairs, everyone gathered around the table, the king counted the money and stacked it in piles of three hundred dollars – he made twenty such piles.</t4568> <t4569>Everyone was looking at the money with greedy eyes and licking their lips.</t4569> <t4570>Then the money was put back into the bag, and I saw that the king was preparing to give another speech.</t4570>
<t4571>“My friends, my poor brother lying here has made a generosity to those left behind in this mournful land.</t4571> <t4572>He has made a generosity to these poor little lambs he loved and protected, now left without a father and mother.</t4572> <t4573>We who know him, know very well that if he did not hesitate to hurt his dear brother William and me, he would be even more generous to them.</t4573> <t4574>Am I wrong?</t4574> <t4575>If you ask me, I have no doubt about it.</t4575> <t4576>So how can we call him brother if we hinder him at such a time?</t4576> <t4577>If we rob these poor tender lambs he loved more than his own life at such a time...</t4577> <t4578>yes, if we rob them...</t4578> <t4579>what kind of uncles would we be?</t4579> <t4580>If I know William...</t4580> <t4581>and I believe I do...</t4581> <t4582>he too...</t4582> <t4583>it’s best we ask him.”</t4583> <t4584>He turned towards the duke and made a bunch of signs with his hands again; the duke first looked at him like a complete fool, then suddenly seemed to understand, jumped in place with joy, made a uuu-uuu sound, and hugged the king at least fifteen times.</t4584> <t4585>Then the king turned to the crowd: “I knew it; surely everyone understands what he thinks about this.</t4585> <t4586>Here, Mary Jane, Susan, and Joanner, take the money...</t4586> <t4587>Take it all.</t4587> <t4588>This is a gift to you from the departed, whose body is now cold but whose soul is happy.</t4588><t4589>”</t4589>
<t4590>Mary Jane ran towards him, and Susan and Hare-lip also ran towards the duke; there was more hugging and kissing than I had ever seen before.</t4590> <t4591>There were tears in the eyes of everyone filling the room, many of them shaking our frauds' hands, saying, "You are really very kind!...</t4591> <t4592>So humane!...</t4592> <t4593>How could you do it!" and so on.</t4593>
<t4594>Before long, everyone started talking about the deceased again, mentioning how good a person he was and what a great loss his death was; after a while, a burly, square-faced man pushed his way in and started looking at us and listening to us without saying anything; no one had said anything to him either, because the king was speaking and everyone was busy listening to him.</t4594> <t4595>The king was in the middle of his speech:</t4595>
<t4596>"... because they were close friends of the deceased.</t4596> <t4597>That is why they were invited to the house this evening; but tomorrow we want all of you to come...</t4597> <t4598>everyone; because he had respect for everyone, he loved everyone, so it is very appropriate for the funeral ceremony to be open to everyone.</t4598><t4599>"</t4599>
<t4600>Then he continued to whine and complain, it must have sounded pleasant to his ears because he kept talking about the funeral debauchery over and over again; finally, the duke could no longer bear it; so he wrote on a piece of paper, "you will say ceremony, you big fool," folded the paper and, making a uuu-uuu sound, passed it to him over the heads of the crowd.</t4600> <t4601>The king read what was written, put the paper in his pocket, and continued his speech:</t4601>
<t4602>“Poor William, he may be crippled; but his heart always shows him the right way.</t4602> <t4603>He wants me to invite everyone to the funeral…</t4603> <t4604>He tells me to show hospitality to all of them.</t4604> <t4605>But he doesn't need to worry…</t4605> <t4606>I was going to do that anyway.</t4606><t4607>”</t4607>
<t4608>Then, without breaking his composure, he continued to speak, occasionally mentioning the funeral revelry as he had before.</t4608> <t4609>After saying it three more times, he said:</t4609>
<t4610>“The reason I say 'sefahat' is not because it is widely used, as the commonly used word is 'merasim,' but the correct one is 'sefahat.'</t4610> <t4611>In England, no one says 'merasim' anymore...</t4611> <t4612>This word has been forgotten.</t4612> <t4613>In England, we now say 'funeral sefahat.'</t4613> <t4614>'Sefahat' is more appropriate because it conveys the meaning more accurately.</t4614> <t4615>The word 'sefahat' comes from the Greek 'sefum,' meaning outside, open area, exterior, and the Hebrew 'abat,' meaning to plant, to cover.</t4615> <t4616>Therefore, public funerals are called 'funeral sefahat.'</t4616><t4617>”</t4617>
<t4618>Honestly, he messed up really badly.</t4618> <t4619>The square-faced man burst out laughing in the face of our king.</t4619> <t4620>Everyone was stunned with amazement.</t4620> <t4621>People asked, "Why did you laugh, doctor?" and Abner Shackleford added:</t4621>
<t4622>"Are you unaware of what's going on, Robinson?</t4622> <t4623>The person in front of you is Harvey Wilks.</t4623><t4624>"</t4624>
<t4625>The king extended his hand to the man with a sincere smile:</t4625>
<t4626>“Or are you the doctor friend whom my poor brother loved so much?</t4626> <t4627>I…</t4627><t4628>”</t4628>
<t4629>“Put your hand down!” said the doctor.</t4629> <t4630>“So you speak like the English...</t4630> <t4631>is that so?</t4631> <t4632>The worst imitation I've ever seen.</t4632> <t4633>So you are Peter Wilks' brother.</t4633> <t4634>No, I think you are a complete fraud!</t4634><t4635>”</t4635>
<t4636>Suddenly, everyone's face fell!</t4636> <t4637>They surrounded the doctor, trying to silence him, to explain what had happened, and to tell how Harvey had proven himself to be Harvey in forty different ways.</t4637> <t4638>He knew everyone by name, he even knew the names of the dogs.</t4638> <t4639>They also begged him not to hurt Harvey's and the poor girls' feelings.</t4639> <t4640>But none of it worked; the man continued to speak angrily and said that someone who tried to speak like an Englishman but did such a poor imitation could be nothing but a fraud and a liar.</t4640> <t4641>The poor girls were crying, clinging to the king; the doctor suddenly broke away from the crowd and turned to them.</t4641>
<t4642>"I was your father's friend, and I am your friend too; as a friend who wants to protect you, who doesn't want you to get into trouble and get hurt, I am warning you to turn your back on this scoundrel, to cut all ties with this ignorant vagabond who is trying to convince you with his foolish nonsense in Greek and Hebrew."</t4642> <t4643>"One of the most despicable swindlers I've ever seen..."</t4643> <t4644>"He talks about a bunch of names and events, who knows where he learned them from; you take these as evidence and, with the help of my supposedly sensible but foolish friends here, you are making a fool of yourself."</t4644> <t4645>"Mary Jane Wilks, you know that I am your friend, moreover, a friend who never thinks of himself."</t4645> <t4646>"Now listen to me and throw this miserable rascal out..."</t4646> <t4647>"I beg you."</t4647> <t4648>"Will you do as I say?"</t4648><t4649>"</t4649>
<t4650>Mary Jane stood upright without hesitation, oh, how beautiful she was!</t4650>
<t4651>“Here is my answer,” he said.</t4651> <t4652>He took the money bag and handed it to the king.</t4652> <t4653>“Take this six thousand dollars and use it as you see fit for me and my siblings.</t4653> <t4654>No receipt or anything is needed for this.</t4654><t4655>”</t4655>
<t4656>Then one person took the king's arm, and Susan and Harelip took his other arm.</t4656> <t4657>As the king held his head high and smiled proudly, a storm of applause and cheers erupted.</t4657>
<t4658>The doctor said, "Alright, the sin is off my shoulders."</t4658> <t4659>"But I'm warning you, one day you'll feel sick every time you think about today..."</t4659> <t4660>Then he left.</t4660>
<t4661>“Alright doctor,” said the king, mimicking his speech mockingly, “then we will call you.”</t4661> <t4662>Upon hearing this, everyone burst into laughter and said he had given a very good comeback.</t4662>
<t4663>Chapter Twenty-Six</t4663>
<t4664>After everyone had left, the king asked Mary Jane if they had any extra rooms. The girl said there was an extra room that would be enough for Uncle William, and she would give her own slightly larger room to Uncle Harvey; she herself would set up a bed in her sisters' room; and there was also a small space in the attic with a straw mattress.</t4664> <t4665>The king said the mattress would be enough for his servant – that is, for me.</t4665>
<t4666>Mary Jane took us all upstairs and showed us our simple yet charming rooms.</t4666> <t4667>She said that Uncle Harvey could take the clothes and other knick-knacks from the room if they would get in his way, but he replied that he wouldn't be bothered at all.</t4667> <t4668>The clothes were hung on the wall, with a flannel curtain drawn from ceiling to floor in front of them.</t4668> <t4669>In one corner, there was a leather suitcase, and in another corner, a guitar case, and there were knick-knacks and ornaments that girls like scattered around the room.</t4669> <t4670>The King said that the room felt warmer and more pleasant with these accessories and that there was no need to change their places.</t4670> <t4671>The Duke's room was quite small, but it was also very nice, just like my little attic room.</t4671>
<t4672>That night a grand dinner was given, almost all the men and women came, I stood behind the chairs of the king and the duke and served, while the black people served the others.</t4672> <t4673>Mary Jane sat at the head of the table, Susan sat next to her and was talking about how bad the cookies were, how cheap the candies were, and also said that the roast chicken was very bland and tough – just like women always do, babbling nonsense to force compliments.</t4673> <t4674>She expected people to know and even say that everything was very nice.</t4674> <t4675>She wanted them to say, “How did you make these cookies so brown and crispy?</t4675> <t4676>For God's sake, did you make these wonderful pickles yourself?” and such charlatan chatter; you know, the kind people always do at such communal meals.</t4676>
<t4677>After everyone had eaten and drunk, the harelip and I ate our meal in the kitchen with the leftovers, while the others helped the blacks wash the dishes.</t4677> <t4678>The harelip started pressing me about England, and a few times I felt really cornered.</t4678>
<t4679>“Have you ever seen the king?</t4679><t4680>”</t4680>
<t4681>“Who? William the Fourth?</t4681> <t4682>Of course, I’ve seen him…</t4682> <t4683>He comes to our church.”</t4683> <t4684>I knew he had died years ago, but I didn't let on.</t4684> <t4685>Upon saying that the king came to our church, the girl asked:</t4685>
<t4686>“How…</t4686> <t4687>Regularly?</t4687><t4688>”</t4688>
<t4689>“Yes...</t4689> <t4690>Regularly.</t4690> <t4691>His compartment is directly across from ours...</t4691> <t4692>On the other side of the podium.</t4692><t4693>”</t4693>
<t4694>“I thought the King lived in London, didn't he?</t4694><t4695>”</t4695>
<t4696>“Yes, sitting there.</t4696> <t4697>Where else would they sit?</t4697><t4698>”</t4698>
<t4699>“But I thought you lived in Sheffield.</t4699> <t4700>That's a different city.</t4700><t4701>”</t4701>
<t4702>I was momentarily stunned.</t4702> <t4703>I pretended as if a chicken bone was stuck in my throat and tried to figure out how to backtrack.</t4703> <t4704>Finally, I said:</t4704>
<t4705>"I meant to say that when he is in Sheffield, he comes to our church regularly.</t4705> <t4706>He only comes in the summers when he wants to go swimming.</t4706><t4707>"</t4707>
<t4708>"No way, you fool..."</t4708> <t4709>"Sheffield doesn't have a coast."</t4709><t4710>"</t4710>
<t4711>“Who said it?</t4711><t4712>”</t4712>
<t4713>"You said it."</t4713><t4714>"</t4714>
<t4715>“I didn't say such a thing.</t4715><t4716>”</t4716>
<t4717>"Dedin!"</t4717><t4718>"</t4718>
<t4719>"I didn't say that."</t4719><t4720>"</t4720>
<t4721>"You said it!"</t4721><t4722>"</t4722>
<t4723>“I would never say such a thing in my life.</t4723><t4724>”</t4724>
<t4725>“So, what did you say?</t4725><t4726>”</t4726>
<t4727>“I told him that he came there to swim in the sea…</t4727> <t4728>I said it exactly like this.</t4728><t4729>”</t4729>
<t4730>“That's it!</t4730> <t4731>If it doesn't have a coast, how will it go into the sea?</t4731><t4732>”</t4732>
<t4733>“Now listen carefully, have you ever seen mineral water?</t4733><t4734>”</t4734>
<t4735>“Yes, I saw it.</t4735><t4736>”</t4736>
<t4737>“So, do you need to go to the mine to see mineral water?</t4737><t4738>”</t4738>
<t4739>“No, don't.</t4739><t4740>”</t4740>
<t4741>“William the Fourth doesn't need to go to the sea to take a dip in the sea.</t4741><t4742>”</t4742>
<t4743>“Well, then where does he find the sea?</t4743><t4744>”</t4744>
<t4745>“People find mineral water just as they find it...</t4745> <t4746>They bring it in barrels.</t4746> <t4747>There are large stoves in the palace in Sheffield, the king likes his water hot.</t4747> <t4748>They surely can't heat the water in the sea.</t4748> <t4749>They don't have enough materials for that.</t4749><t4750>”</t4750>
<t4751>“Ah, now I understand.</t4751> <t4752>If you had said it at the beginning, we wouldn't have wasted so much time.</t4752><t4753>”</t4753>
<t4754>When I said this, I realized that I had come out into the open again, I felt relieved and pleased.</t4754> <t4755>Then he asked again:</t4755>
<t4756>“Do you also go to church?</t4756><t4757>”</t4757>
<t4758>“Yes…</t4758> <t4759>Regularly.</t4759><t4760>”</t4760>
<t4761>"Where do you live?"</t4761><t4762>"</t4762>
<t4763>“In our compartment, of course.</t4763><t4764>”</t4764>
<t4765>"Whose compartment is it?</t4765><t4766>"</t4766>
<t4767>“In ours, you know…</t4767> <t4768>During Uncle Harvey's time.</t4768><t4769>”</t4769>
<t4770>“Is it his?</t4770> <t4771>What is he going to do with the compartment?</t4771><t4772>”</t4772>
<t4773>“To sit down.</t4773> <t4774>What else did you think you would do?</t4774><t4775>”</t4775>
<t4776>“Well, I thought he would be at the podium.</t4776><t4777>”</t4777>
<t4778>Damn, I had forgotten he was a priest.</t4778> <t4779>I was stuck again, so I pretended to choke on a chicken bone to find a way out.</t4779> <t4780>Then I said:</t4780>
<t4781>“Oh Allah, do you think there is only one priest in the church?</t4781><t4782>”</t4782>
<t4783>“Yes, what more will they do?</t4783><t4784>”</t4784>
<t4785>“What! To preach in front of the King?</t4785> <t4786>Honestly, I've never seen a girl like you in my life.</t4786> <t4787>There are at least seventeen priests.</t4787><t4788>”</t4788>
<t4789>"Seventeen!"</t4789> <t4790>"Oh my God! No matter how much merit it brings, I can't sit and listen to a sermon in such a church."</t4790> <t4791>"Surely it would take a week for all of them to give their sermons."</t4791>
<t4792>“Oh come on, not all of them give sermons on the same day…</t4792> <t4793>Only one of them does.</t4793><t4794>”</t4794>
<t4795>“So what are the others doing?</t4795><t4796>”</t4796>
<t4797>“They don't do much.</t4797> <t4798>They wander around, carrying dishes and bowls...</t4798> <t4799>They do small tasks.</t4799> <t4800>But essentially, they just stand around idly.</t4800><t4801>”</t4801>
<t4802>“Then what are they doing in the church?</t4802><t4803>”</t4803>
<t4804>“They are standing there as a matter of principle.</t4804> <t4805>Do you not know anything either?</t4805><t4806>”</t4806>
<t4807>“I can do without knowing something as foolish as this.</t4807> <t4808>So, how do they treat servants in England?</t4808> <t4809>Do they treat them better than we treat our black people?</t4809><t4810>”</t4810>
<t4811>“No! No one there treats the servants as human beings.</t4811> <t4812>They see them as lower than dogs.</t4812><t4813>”</t4813>
<t4814>“Don't they give them holidays like we do during Christmas, New Year week, and the Fourth of July?</t4814><t4815>”</t4815>
<t4816>"No way!"</t4816> <t4817>"One can tell from here that you have never been to England."</t4817> <t4818>"Look now, Tavş..."</t4818> <t4819>"Joanna, they don't take any holidays from the beginning to the end of the year; they can never go to the circus, the theater, or to black shows, they can't go anywhere."</t4819><t4820>"</t4820>
<t4821>“To the church too?</t4821><t4822>”</t4822>
<t4823>“To the church too?</t4823><t4824>”</t4824>
<t4825>“But you always said you went to church.</t4825><t4826>”</t4826>
<t4827>I had messed up again.</t4827> <t4828>I had forgotten that I was the old man's servant.</t4828> <t4829>But a moment later, I backtracked and explained that the servant was different from the usual servants; whether they wanted to or not, servants had to go to church, and according to the laws, they had to sit with the family.</t4829> <t4830>But this time, I hadn't managed it very well, because it was clear that he didn't quite believe me.</t4830>
<t4831>“Really?” he asked, “You haven't told me a bunch of lies, have you?</t4831><t4832>”</t4832>
<t4833>"Really," I said.</t4833>
<t4834>“Wasn't any of it a lie?</t4834><t4835>”</t4835>
<t4836>“There were no lies.</t4836> <t4837>I didn't tell a single lie,” I said.</t4837>
<t4838>"Swear on this book and say it like that."</t4838><t4839>"</t4839>
<t4840>I saw that the book was a simple dictionary, so I placed my hand on it and repeated my words.</t4840> <t4841>This time, he seemed a bit more convinced; he said:</t4841>
<t4842>“Alright, I believe some of it; but it's hard to believe the rest.</t4842><t4843>”</t4843>
<t4844>“What do you find hard to believe, Joe?” said Mary Jane, who appeared behind him with Susan by her side.</t4844> <t4845>“It's not right to talk to him like that, it's not polite either, because he is a stranger and far away from his own people.</t4845> <t4846>How can you treat him like this?</t4846><t4847>”</t4847>
<t4848>“You always do this, Mary…</t4848> <t4849>You rush to help people before they even get hurt.</t4849> <t4850>I didn't tell him anything.</t4850> <t4851>He said some unreasonable things, and I told him I didn't swallow it all; I didn't say anything else.</t4851> <t4852>He can probably handle something this small, can't he?</t4852><t4853>”</t4853>
<t4854>“I don't care whether it is small or large, here it is our guest and a stranger, it is not right for you to say these things.</t4854> <t4855>If you were in its place, you would be ashamed when the same things were said; therefore, you should not say things that would cause someone else to be ashamed.</t4855><t4856>”</t4856>
<t4857>“But, Mary, said that...</t4857><t4858>”</t4858>
<t4859>“It doesn't matter what you said...</t4859> <t4860>That's not the issue.</t4860> <t4861>The issue is treating him well and avoiding things that would remind him he's not in his own country, not among his own people.</t4861><t4862>”</t4862>
<t4863>This is the kind of girl I let our old reptile strip, I said to myself!</t4863>
<t4864>Then Susan interrupted and, believe me, hare-lip got the worst scolding I've ever heard in my life from her!</t4864>
<t4865>Another one I let ours peel, I said to myself!</t4865>
<t4866>Then Mary Jane took over the watch and this time adopted a sweet and loving demeanor – that was her style – but when she finished speaking, poor Hare-lip had only one option left.</t4866> <t4867>In the end, he gave up.</t4867>
<t4868>“Alright then,” said the other girls; “now go ahead and apologize to her.</t4868><t4869>”</t4869>
<t4870>The poor girl apologized to me.</t4870> <t4871>And she apologized very beautifully.</t4871> <t4872>She apologized so beautifully that it was the sweetest thing I had ever heard; I wanted to tell her a thousand more lies so she could apologize to me again.</t4872>
<t4873>This is one of the girls whose money I allowed to be stolen, I said to myself!</t4873> <t4874>After Rabbit-lip finished speaking, they did everything to make me feel at home, to make me know I was among friends.</t4874> <t4875>I felt so despicable, treacherous, and bad that I made a firm promise to myself; I would either return the money to them or die.</t4875>
<t4876>Then I said I was going to bed and left the kitchen, but I wasn't really going to bed, to be honest.</t4876> <t4877>When I was alone, I thought everything over thoroughly.</t4877> <t4878>I wondered to myself if I should secretly go to that doctor and report our fraudsters.</t4878> <t4879>No – that wouldn't work.</t4879> <t4880>He could say where he learned it from, and then the king and the duke would make my life miserable.</t4880> <t4881>Should I secretly go and tell Mary Jane?</t4881> <t4882>No – I couldn't do that either.</t4882> <t4883>They would understand everything the moment they looked at the girl's face; they would take the money and run away immediately.</t4883> <t4884>Even if the poor girl asked someone for help, I would get involved in one way or another.</t4884> <t4885>No, there was only one way that could work.</t4885> <t4886>I had to steal the money, and I had to do it in such a way that they would never suspect me.</t4886> <t4887>They had found a good opportunity here and had no intention of leaving without robbing both this family and the town, so I had enough time to wait for a chance.</t4887> <t4888>I would steal the money, hide it somewhere; then after going a bit down the river, I would write a letter to Mary Jane telling her where the money was hidden.</t4888> <t4889>But maybe the best thing was to get the money tonight if I could; because the doctor might not stay as calm as he seemed and could scare our guys into running away.</t4889>
<t4890>Then I thought, the best thing to do is to go and search their rooms.</t4890> <t4891>The corridor upstairs was dark, but I found the duke's room and started feeling around; but then it dawned on me that the king wouldn't entrust that much money to someone else; so I went to his room and started searching there.</t4891> <t4892>However, after a while, I realized I couldn't see anything without light, and besides, lighting a candle here wasn't a smart idea.</t4892> <t4893>The best thing was to resort to the other way, wait for them, and listen to their conversations.</t4893> <t4894>At that moment, I heard footsteps coming from downstairs and made a move to get under the bed; I was just about to get in, but the bed wasn't where I expected it to be, instead, I grabbed the curtain covering Mary Jane's clothes, immediately jumped behind the curtain, and took refuge among the nightgowns, then didn't move at all.</t4894>
<t4895>They entered and closed the door; the first thing the shopkeeper did was to bend down and look under the bed.</t4895> <t4896>At that moment, I was glad I hadn't found the bed.</t4896> <t4897>Still, if you're doing something special, hiding under the bed is very natural.</t4897> <t4898>After that, they sat down and the king began to speak:</t4898>
<t4899>"Yes, what is it?</t4899> <t4900>It would be better if you cut it short, because right now it's more appropriate for us to join the mourning downstairs rather than giving them a chance to stand upstairs and talk about us.</t4900><t4901>"</t4901>
<t4902>"That's enough; Capet.</t4902> <t4903>I'm not at ease, I don't feel peaceful at all.</t4903> <t4904>My mind is stuck on the doctor.</t4904> <t4905>I want to know what you are planning.</t4905> <t4906>I have some ideas, and it would be great if we act according to them.</t4906><t4907>"</t4907>
<t4908>“What is it, Duke?</t4908><t4909>”</t4909>
<t4910>“The best thing is to leave here before three in the morning without being seen and continue down the river with what we have.</t4910> <t4911>Look how easily we handled it – everything was given back to us, almost thrown at our heads; so it means we are allowed to take and go.</t4911> <t4912>If you ask me, let's leave and never come back.</t4912><t4913>”</t4913>
<t4914>When I heard this, I felt very bad.</t4914> <t4915>A couple of hours earlier, it would have been a bit different, but now I felt both bad and frustrated.</t4915> <t4916>The king replied angrily:</t4916>
<t4917>“What did you say?</t4917> <t4918>So, we shouldn't sell the rest of the property?</t4918> <t4919>Should we just leave like two fools and let property worth eight to nine thousand dollars, which is waiting for us to enjoy the cream, stay behind?</t4919> <t4920>Besides, there are still a lot of valuable things to sell.</t4920><t4921>”</t4921>
<t4922>The Duke continued to grumble; he said that his bag of gold was sufficient and that he did not want to go any further – he did not want to steal everything from the orphaned children.</t4922>
<t4923>“What nonsense are you talking about!” said the king.</t4923> <t4924>“We are not completely robbing them, we are just taking this money.</t4924> <t4925>The real trouble will fall upon those who bought the property – the event will be heard shortly after we leave – the sales will be invalidated and all the property will return to them.</t4925> <t4926>Those orphans of yours will get their homes back and that will be enough for them; they are all still in the prime of their lives, they can easily earn their livelihoods.</t4926> <t4927>They will not bear the brunt of this matter.</t4927> <t4928>Just think… there are thousands of people who are not as well off as they are.</t4928> <t4929>They will not be in a situation to complain at all.</t4929><t4930>”</t4930>
<t4931>The king kept advancing towards him, and the duke finally gave in.</t4931> <t4932>But the doctor did not forget to say that staying around was a great foolishness.</t4932> <t4933>The king immediately replied:</t4933>
<t4934>“To hell with the doctor!</t4934> <t4935>Why should we care about him?</t4935> <t4936>Aren't all the fools in the town already on our side?</t4936> <t4937>Don't they make up the majority of the town?</t4937><t4938>”</t4938>
<t4939>They prepared to descend again.</t4939>
<t4940>"I don't think we put the money in a good place," said the duke.</t4940>
<t4941>I was glad to hear this.</t4941> <t4942>I had started to think that they wouldn't give me any useful clues.</t4942>
<t4943>“Why?” asked the king.</t4943><t4944>”</t4944>
<t4945>“Because Mary Jane will be dressed in mourning clothes from now on, the black servant who looks after the rooms will be told to gather these clothes and put them in a chest and store it away; don't you think a black servant would pocket some money if they found it?</t4945><t4946>”</t4946>
<t4947>“Your mind is sharp as ever, duke,” said the king.</t4947> <t4948>He started probing under the curtain a meter away from where I was.</t4948> <t4949>I pressed myself against the wall and didn't even breathe, but I was trembling with fear; at first, I thought about what these men would say if they caught me, and then I tried to think about what I would say if they did.</t4949> <t4950>But before I could gather my thoughts, the king found the bag and didn't notice that I was nearby at all.</t4950> <t4951>They pushed the bag through a tear in the straw mattress under the feather bed; they pushed it in about half a meter and said there was no longer a problem because the blacks only made the feather bed and turned the straw mattress only twice a year, so there was no longer any danger of the bag being stolen.</t4951>
<t4952>But I knew the location of the bag.</t4952> <t4953>Before they reached halfway down the stairs, I took the bag from there.</t4953> <t4954>Without being seen by anyone, I went up to the attic and hid the bag there until I found a better place.</t4954> <t4955>The best thing was to hide the bag somewhere outside the house, because if my family realized it was missing, they could turn the house upside down.</t4955> <t4956>I had no doubt about that.</t4956> <t4957>Then I lay down on the bed without taking off my clothes, but no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't sleep; I wouldn't be able to calm down and sleep until I finished this task.</t4957> <t4958>After a while, I heard the king and the duke coming up; I got out of bed, leaned my chin on the top of the stairs, and started waiting to see if anything would happen.</t4958> <t4959>Nothing happened.</t4959>
<t4960>Upon this, I waited until the sounds of those preparing to sleep ceased, and before the sound of shields could be heard, I quietly descended the stairs to finish my task.</t4960>
<t4961>Chapter Twenty-Seven</t4961>
<t4962>Tiptoeing, I came to their door and started listening; both were snoring.</t4962> <t4963>So, I went downstairs again without making a sound.</t4963> <t4964>Not a sound was heard.</t4964> <t4965>When I looked inside through a crack in the dining room door, I saw that the men waiting for the funeral had fallen asleep on the couches.</t4965> <t4966>The dining room opened into the parlor where the body lay, and there was a lit candle in each room.</t4966> <t4967>When I entered, I saw that the parlor door was open; but there was no one in the parlor except Peter's corpse; so I continued on my way, but the front door was locked and the key was nowhere to be seen.</t4967> <t4968>Just then, I heard someone coming down the stairs and approaching from behind.</t4968> <t4969>I immediately ran to the parlor and looked around hastily; the only place I could hide the bag was the coffin.</t4969> <t4970>The coffin lid was open about thirty centimeters and the dead man's face was exposed, or rather, only a wet cloth covered his face.</t4970> <t4971>I pushed the money bag inside the lid, just below where his hands were clasped on his chest.</t4971> <t4972>When I touched his ice-cold hands, my hair stood on end.</t4972> <t4973>Then I immediately ran to the other end and hid behind the door.</t4973>
<t4974>The person who came was Mary Jane.</t4974> <t4975>She quietly went to the side of the coffin, bent down and looked inside; then she took out her handkerchief and I saw that she started crying, but she made no sound and her back was turned to me.</t4975> <t4976>I immediately left there quietly and after passing through the dining room and closing the door behind me, I looked through the crack in the door to make sure the guards hadn't seen me.</t4976> <t4977>Everything seemed to be fine.</t4977> <t4978>They hadn't moved at all.</t4978>
<t4979>I quietly went up to the attic and lay down on my bed feeling downcast; despite getting myself into so much trouble and taking so many risks, it hadn't turned out well.</t4979> <t4980>As long as the bag stayed where it was, there was no problem; because after the river flowed down about a hundred miles, I could write a letter to Mary Jane and have her dig up the grave to get the money; but that's not how it would go, they would find the money when they closed the lid.</t4980> <t4981>Then the king would get hold of the money again and wouldn't let anyone near it.</t4981> <t4982>Of course, I very much wanted to go down and get the bag from there, but I just couldn't muster the courage.</t4982> <t4983>Morning was approaching and some of the guards might wake up, and I would get caught – and I would get caught with six thousand dollars that no one had allowed me to take.</t4983> <t4984>I thought to myself, I would never want to be in such a situation.</t4984>
<t4985>When I went downstairs in the morning, the living room was closed and the guards were gone.</t4985> <t4986>Apart from the family members, the widow Mrs. Bartley, and our own people, there was no one else around.</t4986> <t4987>I examined their faces to see if anything had happened, but I couldn't understand anything.</t4987>
<t4988>Towards midday, the supplier came with a man and they brought the coffin into the middle of the room and placed it on top of two chairs; then they lined up all the chairs side by side, borrowed some chairs from the neighbors, and filled both the entrance, the living room, and the dining room.</t4988> <t4989>I saw that the lid of the coffin was still in the same position as before, but with so many people around, I didn't dare to look inside.</t4989>
<t4990>After a while, other people started to arrive; women and girls sat in the row by the coffin. For half an hour, people slowly passed by in a line, each taking a minute to look at the dead man's face. Some shed a few tears. Everything was extremely quiet and serious; only the girls and women were wiping their eyes with handkerchiefs and standing with their heads bowed. Occasionally, they would sob.</t4990> <t4991>Nothing could be heard except for the sound of feet dragging on the ground and the sniffles – because people tend to sniffle more at funerals compared to other places outside the church.</t4991>
<t4992>When all the chairs were filled, the quartermaster, with his black gloves and soft, soothing demeanor, made a round to make final adjustments, arranging people and objects neatly and comfortably, all the while behaving as quietly as a cat.</t4992> <t4993>He did not speak at all; he moved people around, squeezed in the latecomers, opened passageways, and did it all with nods and hand signals.</t4993> <t4994>Then he took his place in front of the wall.</t4994> <t4995>He was the lightest, most stealthily advancing, and inconspicuously moving man I had ever seen up to that day; moreover, there was not the slightest hint of a smile on his face.</t4995>
<t4996>A borrowed organ had been brought in – it was a bit out of tune; once everything was ready, a young woman sat down and started playing the organ; it was making quite a bit of creaking and groaning, everyone was joining in the music and singing the hymn.</t4996><t4997>Probably the only person who was comfortable at that moment was Peter.</t4997><t4998>Then Reverend Hobson stood up and began to speak slowly and solemnly; just then, a tremendous barking was heard from the basement; it was a single dog, but it was making a terrible noise, and it just wouldn't stop; the reverend had to stand there by the coffin and wait...</t4998><t4999>One couldn't even hear their own thoughts.</t4999><t5000>It was truly a very inappropriate situation, and no one seemed to know what to do.</t5000><t5001>Soon they saw the long-legged undertaker make a sign to the reverend, meaning "Don't worry, I'll handle it right away."</t5001><t5002>Then the undertaker began to slide along the wall, only his shoulders visible over the heads of the people.</t5002><t5003>As he slid along, the noise and commotion increased, becoming more nerve-wracking; finally, he crossed from one end of the room to the other and disappeared at the basement door.</t5003><t5004>A few seconds later, we heard a "thud!" sound, the dog howled in surprise once or twice, then the noise completely stopped, and the reverend continued his eulogy from where he had left off.</t5004><t5005>A minute or two later, the undertaker's back and shoulders began to slide along the wall again; he slid around three sides of the room, rose a bit, covered his mouth with his hand, stretched his neck towards the reverend over the heads of the people, and whispered loudly: "Caught a rat!" He then lowered himself and slid back to his place along the wall.</t5005><t5006>People seemed very relieved, naturally wanting to know what had happened.</t5006><t5007>Such a small kindness costs nothing, and it is precisely these little things that make a person valued and loved.</t5007><t5008>There was probably no one in town as beloved as this undertaker.</t5008>
<t5009>The funeral ceremony went very well, but it was still long and boring.</t5009><t5010>Finally, the king also approached the coffin and offered a bunch of his usual nonsense, and when he was done, the undertaker approached the coffin with his screwdriver.</t5010><t5011>That's when I got anxious and started watching him closely.</t5011><t5012>But he didn't dawdle at all; he just closed the lid very slowly and tightened the screws well.</t5012><t5013>Look at this situation!</t5013><t5014>I didn't know if the money was in the coffin.</t5014><t5015>What if someone took the bag without anyone noticing, I thought...</t5015><t5016>How would I know whether or not to write to Mary Jane now?</t5016><t5017>Let's say she dug up the grave and found nothing...</t5017><t5018>What would she think about me?</t5018><t5019>Damn, I could get caught and thrown in jail; the best thing was to keep quiet and not draw too much attention, not to write any letters; things had gotten really messed up; I had made things worse while trying to fix them, I wished I had never gotten involved, I was truly a thousand times regretful!</t5019>
<t5020>They buried the funeral; when we returned home, I started examining the faces again – I couldn't help it, I just couldn't relax.</t5020> <t5021>But again, I couldn't make anything out – the faces were telling me nothing.</t5021>
<t5022>When evening came, the king walked around, spoke sweet words to everyone, and acted friendly; meanwhile, he hinted in various ways that his congregation in England was eagerly waiting for him, so he had to hurry, sell off the properties, and return home.</t5022> <t5023>He was sad because he had so little time, and the townspeople were very upset too; they were hoping he would stay longer, but they could understand why that wasn't possible.</t5023> <t5024>Of course, he and William would take the girls home with them; this made everyone happy because the girls would be taken care of, they would be with their relatives; the girls were also happy about this – they were very delighted because they could start a new chapter in their lives and forget their previous troubles; they told him to sell the properties as quickly as possible, they would be ready.</t5024> <t5025>The poor things were so joyful and happy that it broke my heart to see them being deceived and lulled with lies, but I couldn't think of a safe way to intervene and change everything.</t5025>
<t5026>The king immediately opened an auction for the house, the slaves, and all the property – it would be held two days after the funeral, but those interested could come and make offers beforehand.</t5026>
<t5027>The first blow to the girls' joy came the very next day after the funeral, around noon; a few slave traders arrived, and the king sold the blacks at a reasonable price with a three-day note; two of the boys were sent upriver to Memphis, while their mother was sent downriver to Orleans.</t5027> <t5028>I thought the hearts of the poor girls and their blacks would break from grief; they cried and were so distressed while saying goodbye that I couldn't bear to watch anymore.</t5028> <t5029>The girls said they never even considered the possibility that the family would be separated or sold out of town.</t5029> <t5030>I can't seem to forget that scene, the image of the poor, miserable girls and the blacks hugging each other and crying won't leave my mind; if I didn't know that the sale was unjust and that the blacks would return in a week or two, I probably wouldn't have been able to stand it and would have blown the whistle on our gang.</t5030>
<t5031>This event also caused discomfort in the town, with many people openly stating that separating the mother from her children in such a manner was a complete disgrace.</t5031> <t5032>Our swindlers seemed to be in a bit of hot water, but despite everything the duke said or did, the old fool stubbornly stuck to his guns; it was not hard to see that the duke was very disturbed by this situation.</t5032>
<t5033>The auction was to be held the next day.</t5033> <t5034>After the sun had risen in the morning, the king and the duke came to the attic and woke me up; judging by the look on their faces, there was a problem.</t5034>
<t5035>"Did you enter my room the night before last?" asked the king.</t5035>
<t5036>"No, your majesty," I said – I always addressed him this way when there was no one around except our gang.</t5036>
<t5037>“So, did you log in last night?</t5037><t5038>”</t5038>
<t5039>“No; your majesty.</t5039><t5040>”</t5040>
<t5041>“Do you swear?</t5041> <t5042>Don't you dare lie to me.</t5042><t5043>”</t5043>
<t5044>"I swear, your majesty.</t5044> <t5045>I am telling you the truth.</t5045> <t5046>Since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke to show you your room, I have not approached your room in any way.</t5046><t5047>"</t5047>
<t5048>“Well, did you see anyone coming in or going out?” asked the duke.</t5048>
<t5049>“No, Your Excellency, I don't remember seeing anyone.</t5049><t5050>”</t5050>
<t5051>"Pause and think a little."</t5051><t5052></t5052>
<t5053>I pretended to think for a while, and during this time, realizing that my luck had changed, I responded:</t5053>
<t5054>“I saw black people go in there a few times.</t5054><t5055>”</t5055>
<t5056>They both jumped into the air with unease without realizing it.</t5056> <t5057>Then they adopted an attitude as if they had already been expecting this answer from me.</t5057>
<t5058>"Did you see me come and go from all of them?" asked the duke.</t5058>
<t5059>“No…</t5059> <t5060>At least I didn't see them all at once.</t5060> <t5061>I mean, I don't ever remember them all coming out at the same time, except for one time.</t5061><t5062>”</t5062>
<t5063>“So, when was that?”</t5063><t5064>”</t5064>
<t5065>“The day of the funeral.</t5065> <t5066>In the morning.</t5066> <t5067>It wasn't very early, because I had overslept.</t5067> <t5068>Just as I was going down the stairs, I saw them.</t5068><t5069>”</t5069>
<t5070>"Keep telling, go on...</t5070> <t5071>What did they do?</t5071><t5072>"</t5072>
<t5073>“They didn't do anything.</t5073> <t5074>As far as I could see, they didn't act strangely either.</t5074> <t5075>They tiptoed away; I thought they went inside to tidy up the room, thinking that your majesty had already gotten up, but when they saw that you hadn't, they tried to leave quietly so as not to wake you and get into trouble, of course, if they hadn't already woken you.</t5075><t5076>”</t5076>
<t5077>“My God, we are doomed!” said the king; both of them looked as if they had been struck by a jinn.</t5077> <t5078>They stood there scratching their heads for about a minute, then the duke let out a nervous laugh.</t5078>
<t5079>“They say 'a hand is superior to another,' and the blacks did what they had to do.</t5079> <t5080>They looked so sad because they were going to leave these places!</t5080> <t5081>I truly believed that they were sad.</t5081> <t5082>You believed it too, everyone did.</t5082> <t5083>No one should tell me anymore that blacks don't have acting talent.</t5083> <t5084>They acted so well that they could have fooled everyone.</t5084> <t5085>In my opinion, those blacks are worth a treasure.</t5085> <t5086>If I had some capital and a theater, they alone would be enough as actors…</t5086> <t5087>And we went and sold them for a pittance.</t5087> <t5088>Yes, and on top of that, we don't even have cash, just a promissory note.</t5088> <t5089>What did you do with the note?</t5089><t5090>”</t5090>
<t5091>“I gave it to the bank, of course, we'll get it when the return comes.</t5091> <t5092>Where else would it be?</t5092><t5093>”</t5093>
<t5094>“Alright, good then, thank God.</t5094><t5095>”</t5095>
<t5096>I interjected a bit timidly:</t5096>
<t5097>"Is there a problem?"</t5097><t5098>"</t5098>
<t5099>The king turned to me angrily and shouted:</t5099>
<t5100>“This is none of your business!</t5100> <t5101>Keep your mouth shut and mind your own business…</t5101> <t5102>If you have any, that is.</t5102> <t5103>Never forget this as long as you are in this town, do you hear me?”</t5103> <t5104>Then he turned to the duke again: “There is no other way but to drink a glass of cold water and keep quiet.</t5104><t5105>”</t5105>
<t5106>As they were descending the stairs, the duke let out another laugh:</t5106>
<t5107>“Quick sales; small profits!</t5107> <t5108>What a trade...</t5108><t5109>”</t5109>
<t5110>The king replied angrily:</t5110>
<t5111>“I was doing my best to get rid of them quickly.</t5111> <t5112>If we never made a profit, if we have nothing left, isn't it as much your fault as it is mine?</t5112><t5113>”</t5113>
<t5114>“If you had listened to my advice, they would still be in this house, but we would not be.”</t5114><t5115>”</t5115>
<t5116>The king replied to him, trying not to let anyone else hear, and then brought the conversation back to me.</t5116> <t5117>Even though I saw the blacks quietly leaving the room, he cursed and swore at me for not telling him – he said even the most brainless person could understand that something was going on.</t5117> <t5118>Then he turned back and cursed himself a bit; he said all this happened because he stayed up late and didn't get enough rest that morning, and he swore he would never do such a thing again.</t5118> <t5119>They walked away chatting like that, and I was extremely happy because I blamed the blacks, but they wouldn't suffer any harm from it.</t5119>
<t5120>Twenty-Eighth Chapter</t5120>
<t5121>It was almost time to get up.</t5121> <t5122>I came down from the attic stairs and headed towards the stairs to the lower floor, but as I passed by the girls' room, I noticed that the door was open.</t5122> <t5123>Mary Jane was sitting inside next to an old trunk, the trunk was open and partially filled – she was preparing to go to England.</t5123> <t5124>But now she was sitting with a folded nightgown in her lap, crying with her face in her hands.</t5124> <t5125>Seeing her like that made me feel terrible, anyone's heart would break.</t5125> <t5126>I went inside and said to her:</t5126>
<t5127>"Ms. Mary Jane, you can't stand seeing people suffer, I can't stand it either...</t5127> <t5128>Not at all.</t5128> <t5129>Tell me about it.</t5129><t5130>"</t5130>
<t5131>He narrated.</t5131> <t5132>He was thinking about the black people – exactly what I had guessed.</t5132> <t5133>The trip he was going to make to England had almost turned into a nightmare for him; knowing that the mother and her children might never see each other again, could he be happy there even for a single day?</t5133> <t5134>Then, with an even more sorrowful gesture, he raised his hands upwards:</t5134>
<t5135>"My God, my God, even thinking that they will never see each other again!..</t5135><t5136>"</t5136>
<t5137>“But they will see…</t5137> <t5138>Within two weeks…</t5138> <t5139>I am sure of it!</t5139><t5140>”</t5140>
<t5141>Without even realizing it, the words slipped out of my mouth!..</t5141> <t5142>Before I could say anything, she hugged my neck and started saying, say it again, say it again, say it again!</t5142>
<t5143>At a moment when I least expected it, he spoke, said too many things, and I was cornered.</t5143> <t5144>I asked for a minute to think; there, with impatience and excitement, in all her beauty, but in a happy and relieved state, she sat like someone whose aching tooth had been pulled.</t5144> <t5145>I also started to ponder in my own way.</t5145> <t5146>In a moment when he was cornered, a person who stood up and told the truth would probably have taken great risks; though I had no experience in this matter, so I wasn't absolutely sure, but that's what I thought.</t5146> <t5147>Still, it was clear that I was in a situation where telling the truth was better, even safer, than lying.</t5147> <t5148>I should write this down in a corner of my mind and think it over thoroughly at a convenient time, it seemed very strange and against the rules.</t5148> <t5149>Such a thing had never happened to me before.</t5149> <t5150>In the end, well, I said to myself, I will face everything, it will be like sitting on a powder keg and striking a match to see where I will fly, but this time I will take the risk and tell the truth.</t5150>
<t5151>“Miss Mary Jane,” I said, “is there a place not too far outside of town where you could stay for two or three days?</t5151><t5152>”</t5152>
<t5153>"Yes... Mr. Lothrop's house.</t5153> <t5154>Why?"</t5154>
<t5155>"Never mind the reason for now.</t5155> <t5156>If I tell you that the Negroes will see each other again, and within two weeks in this very house, and if I prove how I know it... can you go and stay at the Lothrops' for about four days?</t5156><t5157>"</t5157>
<t5158>“Four days!” he said.</t5158> <t5159>“I would stay even for a year!</t5159><t5160>”</t5160>
<t5161>“Alright then,” I said, “I just want you to promise me one thing…”</t5161> <t5162>“If it were someone else, I would ask them to kiss the Holy Book.”</t5162> <t5163>She smiled, and a very pleasant blush appeared on her cheeks.</t5163> <t5164>“If you don't mind, I won't even close the door…</t5164> <t5165>in fact, I need to bolt it,” I said.</t5165>
<t5166>After locking the door, I came back, sat down again, and started to tell:</t5166>
<t5167>“Do not scream.</t5167> <t5168>Sit quietly in your place and try to react like a man.</t5168> <t5169>I will tell you the truth and you will brace yourself, Miss Mary, because I am going to tell you something bad, something hard to bear, but I have no other choice.</t5169> <t5170>These uncles of yours are definitely not your real uncles…</t5170> <t5171>just a pair of impostors…</t5171> <t5172>common thieves that you know.</t5172> <t5173>Yes, we have passed the hardest part…</t5173> <t5174>you can endure the rest more easily.</t5174><t5175>”</t5175>
<t5176>Of course, he was shaken when he heard this; but I had already moved to shallow waters, so I told everything without a pause, as sparks increasingly flashed in his eyes; I started from where we first encountered the young fool going up the river to board the steamboat, and as I was recounting how she threw herself into the king's arms in front of the house and kissed him sixteen or seventeen times, the girl suddenly jumped up, she was bright red.</t5176>
<t5177>"Monster! Come, we can't lose even a minute, not even a second..."</t5177> <t5178>"Let them cover them in tar and feathers, then throw them into the river!"</t5178><t5179>"</t5179>
<t5180>“Absolutely true,” I said.</t5180> <t5181>“But before you go to the Lothrops, or...</t5181><t5182>”</t5182>
<t5183>“Ah, what nonsense am I talking!” she said and sat down again.</t5183> <t5184>“Please pretend you didn't hear anything I said, I didn't say anything, okay?”</t5184> <t5185>She placed her hand, as soft as silk, on mine in such a way that I could have given my life rather than resist her.</t5185> <t5186>“I completely lost my mind, I got very angry,” she said; “now continue, I won't do it again.</t5186> <t5187>Tell me what we should do, I will do whatever you say.</t5187><t5188>”</t5188>
<t5189>“I can outsmart these two swindlers, and I've been forced to travel with them for a while now...</t5189> <t5190>It's better if I don't tell you the reason...</t5190> <t5191>If you report them immediately, the townspeople will rescue me from their clutches, and I will be safe, but there's someone else you don't know about, and they will get into big trouble.</t5191> <t5192>We need to protect them, don't we?</t5192> <t5193>Of course, I'm right.</t5193> <t5194>Anyway, let's not report them right away.</t5194><t5195>”</t5195>
<t5196>While saying these words, a good idea came to my mind.</t5196> <t5197>Maybe Jim and I could get rid of these frauds; they would end up in jail here, and we would just leave.</t5197> <t5198>But I didn't want to travel on the raft during the day without anyone else to answer questions; so I had to adjust my plan for quite late hours.</t5198>
<t5199>"Ms. Mary Jane, now let me tell you what we are going to do," I said.</t5199> <t5200>"You won't need to stay at Mr. Lothrop's house for too long.</t5200> <t5201>How far is it?</t5201><t5202>"</t5202>
<t5203>“A little closer than four miles...</t5203> <t5204>Just outside the town.</t5204><t5205>”</t5205>
<t5206>“Well, this will do the job.</t5206> <t5207>Now you will go there and stay out of sight until nine or nine-thirty this evening, then tell them to take you home because you forgot something.</t5207> <t5208>If you come back before eleven in the evening, light a candle in front of this window; if I am not around, wait until eleven, and if I still do not appear, it means I have left and am safe.</t5208> <t5209>Then you can come out and spread the news to everyone, and those scoundrels can be put in jail.</t5209><t5210>”</t5210>
<t5211>“Okay,” he said, “I will do exactly that.</t5211><t5212>”</t5212>
<t5213>"But if I cannot escape and get caught with them, you must say that I told you everything in advance and defend me with all your strength."</t5213><t5214>"</t5214>
<t5215>“Of course, I will defend you.</t5215> <t5216>They can't even touch a single strand of your hair!” he said.</t5216> <t5217>As he said these things, I saw his nostrils flare and his eyes shine.</t5217>
<t5218>"If I leave, I won't be here to prove that those swindlers are not your uncles, and even if I were here, I couldn't prove it.</t5218> <t5219>All I could do is swear that they are swindlers and frauds; though that is something.</t5219> <t5220>Anyway, there are those who can prove it better than I can, and no one will doubt them.</t5220> <t5221>Let me tell you how to find them.</t5221> <t5222>Give me a pen and paper.</t5222> <t5223>Here...</t5223> <t5224>'Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.'</t5224> <t5225>Put this paper somewhere safe, don't lose it.</t5225> <t5226>If the court wants evidence about these two, let them send someone to Bricksville and tell them to catch the men staging the Royal Nonesuch and ask for witnesses...</t5226> <t5227>The whole town will come to testify in the blink of an eye, Miss Mary.</t5227> <t5228>And they will be quite angry too.</t5228><t5229>"</t5229>
<t5230>I have decided that we have now settled everything.</t5230> <t5231>So I continued:</t5231>
<t5232>“Let the auction proceed, there's nothing to worry about.</t5232> <t5233>On the day of the auction, no one has to pay for what they have bought until the end of the day, they just give a promissory note and our swindlers can't go anywhere until they get the money…</t5233> <t5234>When we expose their fraud, the promissory notes will become useless and they won't get a single penny.</t5234> <t5235>It will be just like with the negroes…</t5235> <t5236>Since the sale is not valid, the negroes will return soon.</t5236> <t5237>They won't be able to get the negroes' money either…</t5237> <t5238>Honestly, I don't think they can get away with this, Mrs. Mary.</t5238><t5239>”</t5239>
<t5240>“Alright then,” she said, “I’ll go down and prepare breakfast now, then I’ll head straight to Mr. Lothrop’s.</t5240><t5241>”</t5241>
<t5242>“This is absolutely not possible, Miss Mary Jane,” I said, “you will ruin the whole thing; go before breakfast.</t5242><t5243>”</t5243>
<t5244>“Why?</t5244><t5245>”</t5245>
<t5246>“Why do you think I wanted you to leave from the very beginning, Miss Mary?</t5246><t5247>”</t5247>
<t5248>"Actually, I had never thought about it...</t5248> <t5249>That's right, I don't know.</t5249> <t5250>Why do you want me to leave?</t5250><t5251>"</t5251>
<t5252>“Because you are not a brazen type like others.</t5252> <t5253>One can read your face like a book.</t5253> <t5254>I'm very serious, even deciphering letters and reading a book is harder.</t5254> <t5255>Can you go downstairs and face your uncles, when they kiss you and say good morning...</t5255><t5256>”</t5256>
<t5257>“Oh no, oh no, I can't do it! Right, I should go before breakfast...</t5257> <t5258>I'll gladly go right away.</t5258> <t5259>But am I going to leave my sisters with them?</t5259><t5260>”</t5260>
<t5261>“Yes, don't worry about them.</t5261> <t5262>They can manage for a short while longer.</t5262> <t5263>If all of you go at once, the men might get suspicious.</t5263> <t5264>You must not see them, nor your sisters or anyone else in town; if one of your neighbors asks you how your uncles are this morning, I'm afraid the answer will be written on your face.</t5264> <t5265>No; go straight without stopping anywhere, Miss Mary Jane, I'll handle the rest.</t5265> <t5266>I'll tell Miss Susan that you sent your love to your uncles and that you went out for a few hours to rest, for a change of scenery, or to see a friend, and that you'll be back this evening or early tomorrow morning.</t5266><t5267>”</t5267>
<t5268>“There's no problem in saying that I went to see a friend, but I'm not going to send them my regards or anything.</t5268><t5269>”</t5269>
<t5270>“Alright, since you don't want it.”</t5270> <t5271>Answering her this way was the best – what harm was there.</t5271> <t5272>It was a small thing and it didn't harm anyone; it's such small things that allow people to proceed safely on their paths; Miss Jane would be comfortable and there would be no cost.</t5272> <t5273>“There's just one more thing,” I said, “that money bag.</t5273><t5274>”</t5274>
<t5275>"Yes, they took that too; when I think about how they took it, I feel like a fool."</t5275><t5276></t5276>
<t5277>“Don't feel that way at all.</t5277> <t5278>The bag is not with them.</t5278><t5279>”</t5279>
<t5280>“Why, with whom?</t5280><t5281>”</t5281>
<t5282>"I wish I knew, but I don't.</t5282> <t5283>I had it, because I stole the bag from them: I was thinking of giving it to you, I know where I hid it, but I'm afraid it's not there anymore.</t5283> <t5284>I'm very sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I don't know how to express my sorrow; but I did my best; I'm really telling the truth.</t5284> <t5285>I was almost caught, so I put it in the first place I came across, and then I ran away – but the place I hid it wasn't a good place at all.</t5285><t5286>"</t5286>
<t5287>“Stop blaming yourself already...</t5287> <t5288>It's very bad for you to do this and I can't allow such a thing...</t5288> <t5289>You had no other choice, it was not in your control.</t5289> <t5290>So, where did you hide it?</t5290><t5291>”</t5291>
<t5292>I didn't want to reopen her wounds, moreover, I couldn't bring myself to say the words that would make her see her father's funeral with a money bag on his belly.</t5292> <t5293>For about a minute, the words got stuck in my throat.</t5293> <t5294>Finally, I said:</t5294>
<t5295>"It would be better if I didn't say where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, that is, if you can allow it; but if you want, I can write it down on a piece of paper, and you can read it when you go to the Lothrops'.</t5295> <t5296>Is there any problem with doing it this way?</t5296><t5297>"</t5297>
<t5298>“Of course not.</t5298><t5299>”</t5299>
<t5300>Upon this, I took a piece of paper and wrote: "I put the bag inside the coffin.</t5300> <t5301>While you were crying alone at the coffin at night, I was there too.</t5301> <t5302>I was hiding behind the door and felt very sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.</t5302><t5303>"</t5303>
<t5304>When I thought about her crying alone at night, while the other devils were doing shameful things under her roof and intending to strip her of everything, my eyes welled up with tears again; then, when I folded the paper and gave it to her, I saw that her eyes were also filled with tears.</t5304> <t5305>Gripping my hand with all her strength, she said:</t5305>
<t5306>"Goodbye.</t5306> <t5307>I will do everything exactly as you told me; even if I never see you again, know that I will never forget you, I will think of you many times and pray for you!" Saying this, she left.</t5307>
<t5308>She said she would pray for me!</t5308> <t5309>If she knew me, she would probably find a more appropriate occupation for herself.</t5309> <t5310>But she still did it – she was that kind of person.</t5310> <t5311>If needed, she was brave enough to pray for the treacherous apostle Judas – she was never the type of girl to back down in the face of difficulties.</t5311> <t5312>No matter what anyone says, in my opinion, she was the bravest girl I have ever seen; in fact, I think you couldn't find someone as courageous as her even if you searched for forty years.</t5312> <t5313>It might seem like I'm flattering her, but that's not the case at all.</t5313> <t5314>As for beauty – and also goodness – no one could hold a candle to her.</t5314> <t5315>Since she walked out that door, I haven't seen her; we definitely haven't met again, but I must have thought about her a million times and imagined her saying she would pray for me; if I knew that praying for her would do any good, I would certainly pray with all my heart.</t5315>
<t5316>Mary Jane thus went out, probably using the back door, because no one noticed she had left.</t5316> <t5317>When I ran into Susan and Harelip, I said:</t5317>
<t5318>“What was the name of the family that lived across the river and that you sometimes visited together?</t5318><t5319>”</t5319>
<t5320>“There are a few families,” they said.</t5320> <t5321>“But we mostly go to the Proctors.</t5321><t5322>”</t5322>
<t5323>“That was all of them,” I said.</t5323> <t5324>“I almost forgot.</t5324> <t5325>Miss Mary Jane asked me to tell you that she needs to go there urgently...</t5325> <t5326>One of them has fallen ill.</t5326><t5327>”</t5327>
<t5328>“Which one?</t5328><t5329>”</t5329>
<t5330>“I don't know; or rather, I forgot, but most likely…”</t5330><t5331>”</t5331>
<t5332>“Oh my God, I hope it's not Hanner!</t5332><t5333>”</t5333>
<t5334>“I'm sorry for saying this, but I remember the name as Hanner.</t5334><t5335>”</t5335>
<t5336>“Oh no, it had just recovered last week!</t5336> <t5337>Is its condition very bad?</t5337><t5338>”</t5338>
<t5339>"And how.</t5339> <t5340>They have been watching over him all night; according to Miss Mary Jane, he might only last a few more hours.</t5340><t5341>"</t5341>
<t5342>“Oh, such is fate!</t5342> <t5343>What kind of illness does he have?</t5343><t5344>”</t5344>
<t5345>I couldn't find anything reasonable at the moment and blurted out the first thing that came to mind:</t5345>
<t5346>“He has mumps.</t5346><t5347>”</t5347>
<t5348>"Your grandmother is mumps!"</t5348> <t5349>"Do they ever stand by the head of someone with mumps all night?"</t5349><t5350>"</t5350>
<t5351>“They don't stand; why would they stand?</t5351> <t5352>But you see, it's necessary to stand by someone who has mumps like this.</t5352> <t5353>It's a different kind of mumps.</t5353> <t5354>It's a new type, said Mrs. Mary Jane.</t5354><t5355>”</t5355>
<t5356>“How is it a new species?</t5356><t5357>”</t5357>
<t5358>“It was a mumps mixed with other things.</t5358><t5359>”</t5359>
<t5360>“What other things?</t5360><t5361>”</t5361>
<t5362>“Measles, whooping cough, erysipelas, tuberculosis, jaundice, brain fever, and a whole lot more.</t5362><t5363>”</t5363>
<t5364>“No way!</t5364> <t5365>Do they call all of this mumps?</t5365><t5366>”</t5366>
<t5367>“Miss Mary Jane said so.</t5367><t5368>”</t5368>
<t5369>“Alright, but what sense does it make to call this mumps?</t5369><t5370>”</t5370>
<t5371>“Because it's the mumps.</t5371> <t5372>Everything started with the mumps.</t5372><t5373>”</t5373>
<t5374>“What you said doesn't make any sense to me.</t5374> <t5375>Let's say someone first hit their foot somewhere, then got poisoned, fell into a well, broke their neck, and their brain came out, when someone asks how they died, which thick-headed person would say, 'They hit their foot,'?</t5375> <t5376>Does that make sense to you?</t5376> <t5377>No.</t5377> <t5378>It's utter nonsense.</t5378> <t5379>The story you told is just like that.</t5379> <t5380>I wonder if it's contagious?</t5380><t5381>”</t5381>
<t5382>“Is it not contagious?</t5382> <t5383>You're the one talking nonsense!</t5383> <t5384>It's like stepping on a rake in the dark.</t5384> <t5385>If you don't step on one prong, you'll step on another.</t5385> <t5386>Moreover, if you try to lift your foot off the prong you stepped on, the whole rake comes with it.</t5386> <t5387>The mumps I'm talking about is like such a rake.</t5387> <t5388>It spreads that badly.</t5388> <t5389>And don't think it's like a broken, old rake; once it spreads, it spreads thoroughly.</t5389><t5390>”</t5390>
<t5391>“It's really terrible,” said Harelip.</t5391> <t5392>“I should go to Uncle Harvey right away...</t5392><t5393>”</t5393>
<t5394>"Go ahead," I said, "if it were me, I would go immediately.</t5394> <t5395>It is absolutely necessary to go to him.</t5395> <t5396>If it were me, I wouldn't waste any time.</t5396><t5397>"</t5397>
<t5398>“Why wouldn't you lose?</t5398><t5399>”</t5399>
<t5400>“If you stop and think for a minute, you can figure it out yourself.</t5400> <t5401>Your uncles have to return to England as quickly as possible, don't they?</t5401> <t5402>Surely, they are not thinking of going ahead and making you travel the whole journey alone.</t5402> <t5403>You know they will wait for you.</t5403> <t5404>There's no problem up to this point.</t5404> <t5405>Your Uncle Harvey is a priest, isn't he?</t5405> <t5406>So, would a priest deceive the ship's officer just to get his nephew on board against the rules, especially when there's such an infectious disease in question?</t5406> <t5407>You know he can't do that.</t5407> <t5408>So what will he do?</t5408> <t5409>‘What a pity, but the problems of my church have to be solved on their own, because my nephew has been exposed to a terrible mumps germ made up of many microbes, and my duty is to stay here and wait for three months to see if he gets infected,’ he will say.</t5409> <t5410>But if you still think it's best to tell Uncle Harvey everything, forget it, it's not important.</t5410><t5411>”</t5411>
<t5412>“No way! While we could be traveling and having a good time in England, are we going to hang around here waiting to see if Mary Jane gets sick or not?</t5412> <t5413>Now you talked like a complete fool.</t5413><t5414>”</t5414>
<t5415>“Still, it might be good to tell one of the neighbors.”</t5415><t5416>”</t5416>
<t5417>“Can't you hear what I'm saying?</t5417> <t5418>I mean, there's no one more foolish than you by birth.</t5418> <t5419>Does it never occur to you that they might go and talk to my uncle?</t5419> <t5420>There's no other choice but to not tell anyone anything.</t5420><t5421>”</t5421>
<t5422>"Hmm, maybe you're right...</t5422> <t5423>Yes, you're definitely right.</t5423><t5424>"</t5424>
<t5425>"But still, let's tell Uncle Harvey that she went to his place for a while so he doesn't worry later, right?</t5425><t5426>"</t5426>
<t5427>“Yes, Miss Mary Jane wanted you to do that anyway.</t5427> <t5428>‘Tell them to send my love to Uncle Harvey and Uncle William, kiss them for me, and go across to the other side to see the things…</t5428> <t5429>the things… what was the name of that rich family your Uncle Peter always talked about?..</t5429> <t5430>You know, the one…</t5430><t5431>”</t5431>
<t5432>“I guess you mean the Apthorps, right?</t5432><t5433>”</t5433>
<t5434>“Of course, ah these names never stick in my mind, they are all so complicated.</t5434> <t5435>Yes, he said that you should say you went to call the Apthorps to the auction to buy this house, because Uncle Peter doesn't want anyone else to buy the house; your sister will stay there until she convinces them to come to the auction, and then she will come home if she is not too tired; if she is tired, she will come in the morning.</t5435> <t5436>He asked you not to say anything about the Proctors, just to talk about the Apthorps – you will be telling the truth anyway, because he really is going to visit them to discuss the matter of buying the house; that's exactly what he told me.</t5436><t5437>”</t5437>
<t5438>"Alright then," they said and immediately ran to their uncle, conveyed their love and kisses, and delivered their sister's message.</t5438>
<t5439>Everything was now complete.</t5439> <t5440>The girls wouldn't say anything because they wanted to go to England; the king and the duke would also prefer Mary Jane to go away and work for the auction instead of hanging around Dr. Robinson.</t5440> <t5441>I was feeling very good; I thought I did this job well...</t5441> <t5442>Probably even Tom Sawyer couldn't have done better.</t5442> <t5443>Though he would certainly do it by the book, but since I haven't done such things in my life, I'm not as skillful as he is.</t5443>
<t5444>Anyway, they held the auction in the town square, towards the evening; they dragged it out as long as they could, the old man stood right next to the auctioneer and was striking his most pious poses, occasionally reading a few sentences from the Bible and making fancy speeches; while the duke was wandering around making pitiful sounds like uuu-uuu to gain sympathy.</t5444>
<t5445>But slowly but surely, the auction progressed and eventually everything was sold.</t5445> <t5446>Only a small bag of details remained in the cemetery.</t5446> <t5447>They would find it themselves now...</t5447> <t5448>I had never seen anyone try to extract oil from a fly as much as our king.</t5448> <t5449>While they were busy with this, a steamboat docked at the pier, and two minutes later, the crowd came towards us, shouting, laughing, and making a racket:</t5449>
<t5450>"Here are your rivals! Two more heirs have come for our Peter Wilks...</t5450> <t5451>Whoever pays can choose whichever they want!</t5451><t5452>"</t5452>
<t5453>Twenty-Ninth Chapter</t5453>
<t5454>They were bringing along a very elegant elderly gentleman, and also a younger man, equally elegant, with his right arm in a sling.</t5454> <t5455>My God, how people were shouting; laughing and making a racket.</t5455> <t5456>But I didn't find the situation funny at all, and I thought the duke and the king would be scared when they saw them.</t5456> <t5457>I thought both of them would turn pale as a sheet.</t5457> <t5458>But no, they didn't turn pale at all.</t5458> <t5459>The duke didn't let on that he understood what was happening, he continued to wander around happily and making a "uuu-uuu" sound like a milk churn spraying cream everywhere; the king, on the other hand, looked at the scene with a pained and sorrowful expression, as if deeply wounded by the existence of such frauds and scoundrels in the world.</t5459> <t5460>Ah, it was truly an admirable performance.</t5460> <t5461>Most of the people in the town gathered around the king, trying to show their support for him.</t5461> <t5462>The elderly gentleman came in, utterly dumbfounded.</t5462> <t5463>Soon enough, he started to speak, and indeed, he spoke just like an Englishman, very different from the king's speech, although the king's speech was quite good for an imitation.</t5463> <t5464>I can't describe how the old man spoke, nor can I imitate it; but turning to the crowd, he said something along these lines:</t5464>
<t5465>“I encountered a very surprising situation here that I did not expect at all; I must honestly say that I am not very prepared to face and fight such a thing; because my brother and I had some misfortunes, he broke his arm, and our belongings were mistakenly taken to a town up here last night.</t5465> <t5466>I am Harvey, the older brother of Peter Wilks, and this is his brother William, who is deaf and mute – moreover, since his arm is in a sling now, he cannot even use sign language.</t5466> <t5467>We are the people we claim to be, and I will prove it when my belongings arrive in a day or two.</t5467> <t5468>But until then, I will not say anything else and will go to the hotel to wait.</t5468><t5469>”</t5469>
<t5470>Thus, he walked away with the new deaf-mute by his side, and the king called out after him with a laugh:</t5470>
<t5471>“He broke his arm...</t5471> <t5472>no doubt about it! He broke it at just the right time, truly, at a very convenient time for those tricksters who need to use sign language but haven't learned how to use it.</t5472> <t5473>They lost their belongings!</t5473> <t5474>This is even more marvelous!..</t5474> <t5475>Moreover, very clever...</t5475> <t5476>Considering the circumstances!</t5476><t5477>”</t5477>
<t5478>He laughed again; the others joined him, but three or four people, maybe six or so, did not laugh.</t5478> <t5479>One of them was a doctor; the other was a stern-looking man carrying an old-fashioned cloth bag made of kilim.</t5479> <t5480>He had just gotten off the ferry and was whispering with the doctor; occasionally they would look at the king and nod their heads – this man was Levi Bell, the lawyer who had gone to Louisville; there was also a burly man who came and listened to everything the old gentleman said, and now he was listening to what the king was saying.</t5480> <t5481>When the king finished his words, the burly man called out to him loudly:</t5481>
<t5482>"Hey, look at me, if you are Harvey Wilks, when did you arrive in town?"</t5482><t5483></t5483>
<t5484>“I arrived the day before the funeral, my friend,” said the king.</t5484>
<t5485>“So, what time did you arrive?</t5485><t5486>”</t5486>
<t5487>“I came in the evening...</t5487> <t5488>About an hour or two before sunset.</t5488><t5489>”</t5489>
<t5490>“How did you come?</t5490><t5491>”</t5491>
<t5492>“I came with Susan Powell from Cincinnati.</t5492><t5493>”</t5493>
<t5494>“Well then, what were you doing up at Pint in the morning...</t5494> <t5495>Why were you in a canoe?</t5495><t5496>”</t5496>
<t5497>“I wasn't in Pint in the morning.</t5497><t5498>”</t5498>
<t5499>"You are lying.</t5499><t5500>"</t5500>
<t5501>A few people immediately went to him and begged him not to speak like that to an old man and a priest.</t5501>
<t5502>“To hell with the priest, he's nothing but a fraud and a liar.</t5502> <t5503>He was at Pint in the morning.</t5503> <t5504>Don't you know I sit there?</t5504> <t5505>He was there while I was in front of the house.</t5505> <t5506>I'm sure I saw him.</t5506> <t5507>He was in a canoe, with Tim Collins and a boy beside him.</t5507><t5508>”</t5508>
<t5509>The doctor intervened and asked, "Would you recognize that boy if you saw him again, Hines?</t5509><t5510>"</t5510>
<t5511>“I probably know him, but I'm not sure.</t5511> <t5512>But wait, there he is.</t5512> <t5513>I recognized him immediately.</t5513><t5514>”</t5514>
<t5515>He had pointed at me.</t5515> <t5516>The doctor turned to the others:</t5516>
<t5517>“I don't know if the newcomers are frauds, my friends; but if these two are not frauds, then I must be a fool.</t5517> <t5518>I think our primary duty is to prevent them from escaping until this matter is resolved.</t5518> <t5519>Come on, Hines; the rest of you, follow.</t5519> <t5520>Let's take these men to the inn and confront them with the other two, maybe then we can learn something.</t5520><t5521>”</t5521>
<t5522>The crowd was filled with excitement, although the king's friends were probably not very pleased; still, we all set off together.</t5522> <t5523>The sun was about to set.</t5523> <t5524>The doctor held my hand and led me along the way, he was behaving very well but he definitely did not let go of my hand.</t5524>
<t5525>We all gathered in the hotel's large hall, the lamps were lit, and the new couple was brought in.</t5525> <t5526>First, the doctor spoke:</t5526>
<t5527>“I don't want to wrong these two men, but if you ask me, they are swindlers, and they might have accomplices we don't know about.</t5527> <t5528>If they have accomplices, they would have already taken the bag with Peter Wilks' gold and fled?</t5528> <t5529>We cannot allow this.</t5529> <t5530>If these two are not frauds, they will not object to bringing the money and letting us keep it until they prove they are telling the truth…</t5530> <t5531>Am I wrong?</t5531><t5532>”</t5532>
<t5533>Everyone agreed to this.</t5533> <t5534>I had already decided that our gang was cornered.</t5534> <t5535>They had lost from the start.</t5535> <t5536>But the king replied with sorrow:</t5536>
<t5537>“Gentlemen; I wish the money were at home, because I have no intention of obstructing the fair, transparent, and detailed investigation of this dirty business; but unfortunately, the money is not there; you can send someone to check if you want.</t5537><t5538>”</t5538>
<t5539>“So where is the money?</t5539><t5540>”</t5540>
<t5541>“My nephew had given me the money to keep, thinking we would stay here for at most a few days, I didn't see the need to deposit it all in the bank and placed it inside the straw mattress under my bed; I thought the bed was a safe place, we are not very accustomed to negroes, we thought they were like the honest servants in England.</t5541> <t5542>The next morning, as soon as I came down the stairs, the negroes had stolen the money; I didn't know the money was gone when I sold them, so we couldn't catch them.</t5542> <t5543>My servant can confirm what I have said.</t5543><t5544>”</t5544>
<t5545>The doctor and a few others said, "Nonsense!" and I saw that no one fully believed the king.</t5545> <t5546>One of the men turned to me and asked if the money had been stolen by the black people.</t5546> <t5547>I said I hadn't seen it, but I had seen them quietly leaving the room and nothing had occurred to me; I thought they were afraid of waking the gentleman and were trying to get away without getting into trouble.</t5547> <t5548>They only asked me this.</t5548> <t5549>Then the doctor suddenly turned to me and asked:</t5549>
<t5550>“Are you English too?</t5550><t5551>”</t5551>
<t5552>Yes, I said; the doctor and a few others laughed out loud, saying, "Nonsense!"</t5552>
<t5553>Then they returned to the general inquiry; one spoke, then the other, hours passed, and no one mentioned eating, it seemed as if food hadn't even crossed their minds – they argued and argued; it was the most complicated situation you could ever see.</t5553> <t5554>They made the king tell his own story, they made the old gentleman tell his own story; everyone except the biased fools realized that the old gentleman was telling the truth and the king was lying.</t5554> <t5555>At one point, they asked me to tell everything I knew.</t5555> <t5556>The king glanced sideways, obviously expecting me to take his side.</t5556> <t5557>I started talking about Sheffield and how we lived there; I also mentioned the English Wilkses; but I couldn't say much, because the Doctor started laughing and the lawyer Levi Bell said:</t5557>
<t5558>“Sit here, child.</t5558> <t5559>If I were you, I wouldn't stress myself so much.</t5559> <t5560>You're probably not used to lying, you can't make things up on the spot, you need some practice.</t5560> <t5561>You're a very bad liar.</t5561><t5562>”</t5562>
<t5563>I was in no condition to care about the man's praise; I was very pleased to be left alone.</t5563>
<t5564>The doctor started to explain something, but then turned and said:</t5564>
<t5565>"I wish you had been here when they came to town, Levi Bell..."</t5565><t5566>"</t5566>
<t5567>The king immediately intervened and extended his hand.</t5567>
<t5568>“Aren't you the old friend my poor deceased brother often wrote letters about?</t5568><t5569>”</t5569>
<t5570>They shook hands with the lawyer, the lawyer smiled, he seemed pleased.</t5570> <t5571>After talking for a while, they stepped aside and whispered a bit.</t5571> <t5572>Finally, the lawyer said loudly:</t5572>
<t5573>“Then it will be resolved.</t5573> <t5574>If you and your brother provide written instructions, there will be no problem.</t5574><t5575>”</t5575>
<t5576>Thus, they found a piece of paper and a pen; the king sat down, tilted his head to one side, stuck his tongue out halfway, and scribbled something; then he handed the pen to the duke – the duke looked genuinely on edge for the first time.</t5576> <t5577>But still, he took the pen and wrote.</t5577> <t5578>The lawyer then turned to the new elderly gentleman:</t5578>
<t5579>“Please, you and your brother each write a few lines and sign them.”</t5579><t5580>”</t5580>
<t5581>The elderly gentleman wrote, but no one could read what he had written.</t5581> <t5582>The lawyer was very surprised by this.</t5582>
<t5583>“Well, that’s correct,” he said – taking out a bunch of old letters from his pocket and examining them, then examining the handwriting of the old men: “These are letters from Harvey Wilks; and these are the handwriting of these two, it’s immediately obvious that they didn’t write the letters” (the king and the duke had realized how the lawyer had outsmarted them and were left gaping like fools), “this handwriting you see here is also from this old gentleman, it’s immediately obvious that he didn’t write the letters either…</t5583> <t5584>In fact, the scribbles don’t even resemble proper writing.</t5584> <t5585>Here are these letters too…</t5585><t5586>”</t5586>
<t5587>The new elderly gentleman interjected:</t5587>
<t5588>"If you allow me, I will explain.</t5588> <t5589>No one but my brother can read my handwriting...</t5589> <t5590>That's why he transcribes my letters.</t5590> <t5591>The handwriting you see in your letters is not mine but his.</t5591><t5592>"</t5592>
<t5593>“Alright!” said the lawyer, “It sounds like a reasonable claim.</t5593> <t5594>I also have some of William's letters with me; if you can get him to write a few lines, we can get a definite result...</t5594><t5595>”</t5595>
<t5596>“He cannot write with his left hand,” the elderly gentleman interrupted.</t5596> <t5597>“If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote both his own letters and mine.</t5597> <t5598>Please compare the handwriting in the letters...</t5598> <t5599>You will see that they are the same.</t5599><t5600>”</t5600>
<t5601>The lawyer compared the letters and said:</t5601>
<t5602>“Indeed, the same person wrote it...</t5602> <t5603>Even if it's not the same person, there is an incredible similarity that I never noticed before.</t5603> <t5604>Yes, the matter has become a bit complicated!</t5604> <t5605>Actually, I thought I was making progress towards a solution, but it seems we've hit a wall again.</t5605> <t5606>Still, one thing is certain - these two are definitely not the Wilkses”– he indicated the king and the duke with his head.</t5606>
<t5607>Yes, in this situation, what do you think our mule-brained old fool did?</t5607> <t5608>He still wouldn't give up, you say, right?</t5608> <t5609>Indeed, he didn't give up.</t5609> <t5610>He said this was an unfair test.</t5610> <t5611>He said his brother William was the most incorrigible jester in the world, he hadn't even tried to write properly...</t5611> <t5612>In fact, he had sensed that the moment a pen and paper were placed in front of William, he would make one of his jokes again.</t5612> <t5613>He gradually opened up and continued to babble, eventually even starting to believe what he was saying himself – but soon the new old gentleman interrupted:</t5613>
<t5614>“I just thought of something.</t5614> <t5615>His brother… I mean, was there anyone among you who helped with the burial of the late Peter Wilks?</t5615><t5616>”</t5616>
<t5617>Someone said, "Yes, Ab Turner and I did it."</t5617> <t5618>"We are both here.</t5618><t5619>"</t5619>
<t5620>Upon this, the old man turned to the king and asked:</t5620>
<t5621>"Maybe this gentleman can tell us what tattoo the deceased had on his chest, what do you think?</t5621><t5622>"</t5622>
<t5623>I saw the king stagger slightly, he immediately recovered, otherwise, he would have collapsed like a piece of shore undermined by the river.</t5623> <t5624>He had taken the blow suddenly, and it was such a blow that whoever it struck suddenly would be flattened.</t5624> <t5625>How could he have known what tattoo the man had on his chest?</t5625> <t5626>He turned a bit pale; he couldn't help it; there wasn't a sound, and everyone was leaning forward a bit, looking at him.</t5626> <t5627>This time he will throw in the towel, I said to myself – he had nothing left to do.</t5627> <t5628>Did he surrender then?</t5628> <t5629>It's hard to believe, but he still didn't surrender.</t5629> <t5630>He was probably planning to drag the matter out until people got tired, so the crowd would thin out and he could escape with the duke.</t5630> <t5631>Yet he continued to sit there and finally responded with a smile:</t5631>
<t5632>"This is truly a difficult question, isn't it!</t5632> <t5633>Let me tell you what tattoo the deceased had on his chest, sir.</t5633> <t5634>Just a small, thin blue arrow – that's all the tattoo is; but you can't see it unless you look closely.</t5634> <t5635>So what do you think is on his chest...</t5635> <t5636>huh?</t5636><t5637>"</t5637>
<t5638>I had truly never seen anyone as brazen and leather-faced as this old trickster.</t5638>
<t5639>The new elderly gentleman immediately turned to Ab Turner and his friend.</t5639> <t5640>This time, it was clear from the sparkle in his eyes that he thought he had caught the king.</t5640>
<t5641>“So, you heard what he said!” he said.</t5641> <t5642>“Was there such a mark on Peter Wilks' chest?</t5642><t5643>”</t5643>
<t5644>Both men answered at once:</t5644>
<t5645>"We did not see such a sign.</t5645><t5646>"</t5646>
<t5647>“Alright!” said the elderly gentleman.</t5647> <t5648>“On the tattoo you saw on his chest, there was a small dark-colored P and a B (these were the initials he used when he was young) and a W, with dashes in between: P – B – W” – then he made a copy of the tattoo on a piece of paper.</t5648> <t5649>“Look…</t5649> <t5650>Wasn't the tattoo you saw like this?</t5650><t5651>”</t5651>
<t5652>The men both answered again:</t5652>
<t5653>“No, it wasn't.</t5653> <t5654>We never saw these signs.</t5654><t5655>”</t5655>
<t5656>This time, everyone was confused; they started shouting:</t5656>
<t5657>“They are all swindlers!</t5657> <t5658>Let's give them a good soaking!</t5658> <t5659>Throw them into the river and drown them, tie them to a post!” There was quite a commotion as everyone was shouting and yelling in unison.</t5659> <t5660>But the lawyer climbed onto the table and shouted:</t5660>
<t5661>“Gentlemen… gentlemen! Listen to me for a moment, I will say just one thing – if you want!</t5661> <t5662>There is another way…</t5662> <t5663>Let's go and exhume the body and see.</t5663><t5664>”</t5664>
<t5665>This is what they liked.</t5665>
<t5666>People started to leave the hall shouting "Hurrah!"; but the lawyer and the doctor stopped them:</t5666>
<t5667>“Wait a moment!</t5667> <t5668>First, hold these four and the boy tightly, we're taking them too!</t5668><t5669>”</t5669>
<t5670>“Yes, let's catch him!” shouted the crowd, “If we see that he has no tattoos, we will lynch them all at once!</t5670><t5671>”</t5671>
<t5672>That's when I really started to get scared.</t5672> <t5673>But there was no way to get out of this situation.</t5673> <t5674>They held us tightly and took us to the cemetery a mile and a half down the river.</t5674> <t5675>The whole town was following us, because the commotion we caused had caught everyone's attention, and it was only nine in the evening.</t5675>
<t5676>As I was passing by our house, I regretted sending Mary Jane out of town; because if I gave her a signal, she could immediately come out and save me and also expose the fraudsters.</t5676>
<t5677>We were moving along the road by the river in a disorderly mob, like wild animals.</t5677> <t5678>As if this situation wasn't frightening enough, the sky had darkened, lightning was striking here and there, and the whistle of the wind passing through the leaves was growing stronger.</t5678> <t5679>I was in the most terrifying and dangerous situation I had ever experienced; I was all tangled up; things had taken a very different turn from what I had calculated.</t5679> <t5680>Supposedly, I was going to wander around the town as I pleased and even watch the events from the outside.</t5680> <t5681>After all, Mary Jane was behind me, and if I got trapped, she would rescue me.</t5681> <t5682>But now, there was nothing between me and sudden death except for the signs on a tattoo.</t5682> <t5683>If they found the tattoo, that is…</t5683>
<t5684>I couldn't bear to think about the matter; but still, I couldn't think of anything else.</t5684> <t5685>The sky grew darker and darker.</t5685> <t5686>If I had the chance, I would have bolted and run away, but that giant – Hines – had grabbed me by the wrist.</t5686> <t5687>It would probably be easier to try to escape from a giant's hand.</t5687> <t5688>He was practically dragging me, he was very excited; I had to run to keep up with him.</t5688>
<t5689>When the crowd arrived at the cemetery, they poured inside and spread among the graves like a flood.</t5689> <t5690>Upon reaching the grave, they realized that they had brought a hundred times more shovels than needed, but no one had brought a lantern.</t5690> <t5691>Nevertheless, they began digging by the light of the lightning and sent someone to borrow a lantern from the nearest house half a mile away.</t5691>
<t5692>While they were digging with great effort, the sky grew darker, the rain poured down, the wind started to howl, the lightning drew closer and the thunder increased; but they were not even aware of it, all of them were focused on this task; for a moment, you could see everything and every face in that large crowd, the shovelfuls of mud being thrown out of the grave, and the next moment the darkness erased everything and you could see nothing.</t5692>
<t5693>Finally, they reached the coffin and began to remove the lid.</t5693> <t5694>In the crowd, there was a new wave of squeezing, elbowing, and pushing; everyone wanted to get closer and see the coffin; we were in a terrible state in that darkness.</t5694> <t5695>Hines was pulling my wrist so hard that it hurt a lot; he was probably so excited and curious that he had forgotten I even existed.</t5695>
<t5696>Suddenly, a lightning bolt flashed, and everything was illuminated in bright white.</t5696> <t5697>Someone shouted:</t5697>
<t5698>“Oh my God, look over there, the bag of gold was right here on his chest!</t5698><t5699>”</t5699>
<t5700>A cry of astonishment rose from Hines just like everyone else.</t5700> <t5701>He let go of my wrist and started pushing through the crowd to get a look; no one saw that I had immediately disappeared and was running towards the road in the dark.</t5701>
<t5702>There was no one else on the road but me, I was practically flying – at least on the road, there was nothing but the pitch darkness, the occasional lightning illuminating everything, the patter of the rain, the howl of the wind, and the thunder; I was wildly running along the road!</t5702>
<t5703>When I arrived in the town, I saw that no one was left on the streets because of the storm, so I didn't wander through the back streets at all; I went straight down the main street, and as I approached our house, I squinted my eyes and looked carefully.</t5703> <t5704>I couldn't see any light; the house was shrouded in darkness – seeing this, I felt overwhelmed with disappointment, though I didn't know why.</t5704> <t5705>But just as I was about to lose sight of the house, a light turned on in Mary Jane's window!</t5705> <t5706>Suddenly, my heart started pounding with excitement; at the same time, the house and everything else remained behind me in the darkness, and I would never see that house again in my life.</t5706> <t5707>Mary Jane was the best and most honest girl I had ever seen until that day.</t5707>
<t5708>After advancing far enough above the town to see our little island, I started scanning the shore to find a boat to borrow; at the first flash of lightning, I saw an unchained boat; I immediately grabbed it and placed the oar.</t5708> <t5709>It was a canoe and was only tied with a rope.</t5709> <t5710>The little island was quite far, somewhere in the middle of the river, but I didn't waste any time; when I finally reached the raft, I was so exhausted that if I had time, I would have immediately lain down to catch my breath for a while.</t5710> <t5711>But I didn't have time.</t5711> <t5712>As soon as I jumped onto the raft, I called out:</t5712>
<t5713>"We're leaving immediately, Jim, untie the ropes!"</t5713> <t5714>"May God help us, I think we've escaped from them!"</t5714><t5715>"</t5715>
<t5716>Jim suddenly appeared and approached me with open arms joyfully; but when I saw him in the lightning's flash, my heart leapt into my mouth and I stepped back and fell off the raft; because I had forgotten that he was in the guise of both the old King Lear and the drowned Arab, I was almost scared out of my wits.</t5716> <t5717>Luckily, Jim pulled me out of the water, he wanted to hug me and pray, he was so happy that I had returned and escaped from the king and the duke, but I stopped him:</t5717>
<t5718>“Jim, save all of this for the morning, save everything for the morning!</t5718> <t5719>Untie the rope so we can get out of here!</t5719><t5720>”</t5720>
<t5721>Two seconds later, we had started drifting down the river; how wonderful it was to be free again, to be on our own in the vast river, and for no one to disturb us.</t5721> <t5722>I was so excited that I couldn't stay still; I started spinning on the raft, jumping and clicking my heels together in the air, but when I clicked my heels together for the third time, I heard a very familiar sound – I immediately held my breath and started listening – it was very clear, the next flash of lightning illuminated the surface of the water, here they were coming!</t5722> <t5723>– they were rowing with all their might, practically making the boat fly!</t5723> <t5724>The king and the duke were right behind us.</t5724>
<t5725>At that moment, my knees gave way, I collapsed onto the planks and surrendered.</t5725> <t5726>I made a great effort not to sob uncontrollably.</t5726>
<t5727>Thirtieth Chapter</t5727>
<t5728>When they left the room, the king immediately grabbed my throat and started shaking me:</t5728>
<t5729>“So you were trying to get rid of us, you son of a dog!</t5729> <t5730>Were you getting tired of us, huh?</t5730><t5731>”</t5731>
<t5732>"No; your majesty," I said.</t5732> <t5733>"We are not bored with you...</t5733> <t5734>Please don't do it, your majesty!</t5734><t5735>"</t5735>
<t5736>“Then what was on your mind, quickly tell me, or I'll rip your liver out!</t5736><t5737>”</t5737>
<t5738>“Alright, alright, I will tell you everything as it is, honestly, your majesty.</t5738> <t5739>The man who held me treated me very well, he kept saying that he had a son around my age but he died last year, he was very upset to see a child in such a dangerous situation; when the gold was found and everyone rushed towards the coffin, he let me go and whispered: “Run away now, or they will definitely hang you!” So I ran away.</t5739> <t5740>There was no point in staying there – I couldn’t do anything and I didn’t want to stay and get hanged when I could escape.</t5740> <t5741>So I ran until I found a canoe; when I got here, I told Jim to hurry, otherwise they would catch and hang me, I told him that you and the duke were no longer alive, I was very upset, Jim was upset too, when we saw you coming, we were so happy that we didn’t know what to do, if you don’t believe me, ask Jim.</t5741><t5742>”</t5742>
<t5743>Jim confirmed me too, but the king told him to shut up and turned back to me: "Of course, I believed it too!"</t5743> <t5744>Then he started shaking me again and said the best thing would be to strangle me.</t5744> <t5745>But the duke intervened:</t5745>
<t5746>"Leave the child, you old fool!</t5746> <t5747>Would you have acted any differently?</t5747> <t5748>Did you check where he was when he was free?</t5748> <t5749>I don't remember at all.</t5749><t5750>"</t5750>
<t5751>The king left me and started cursing the town and everyone in it.</t5751> <t5752>But the duke opposed again:</t5752>
<t5753>“You should actually curse yourself, because you are the one who deserves the curse the most.</t5753> <t5754>From the beginning, you did nothing that made any sense; your only useful move was fabricating that imaginary blue arrow sign with cold-bloodedness and brazenness.</t5754> <t5755>It was a brilliant idea – truly wonderful; it was what saved us.</t5755> <t5756>Otherwise, they would have locked us up somewhere until the Englishman's belongings arrived, and then we would have ended up in jail!</t5756> <t5757>We would have stayed there for life, God knows.</t5757> <t5758>But thanks to that trick, they went all the way to the cemetery, and the bag of gold did us an even greater favor; because if those fools hadn't left us in their excitement and rushed towards the grave, we would be sleeping with our neckties on tonight – the mandatory ones – and we would have worn them for much longer than we needed to.</t5758><t5759>”</t5759>
<t5760>They paused for a moment and thought, then the king said absentmindedly:</t5760>
<t5761>“We thought the gold was stolen by the blacks!</t5761><t5762>”</t5762>
<t5763>I shuddered when I heard this!</t5763>
<t5764>“Yes, indeed,” said the duke, slowly, with a meaningful and mocking tone.</t5764> <t5765>“That's what we thought.</t5765><t5766>”</t5766>
<t5767>After thinking for about half a minute, the king spoke again:</t5767>
<t5768>“At least… that's what I thought.</t5768><t5769>”</t5769>
<t5770>The Duke replied in the same manner:</t5770>
<t5771>“On the contrary… I thought so.</t5771><t5772>”</t5772>
<t5773>The king suddenly straightened up:</t5773>
<t5774>“Look at me, Bridgewater, what do you mean?</t5774><t5775>”</t5775>
<t5776>The Duke immediately retorted:</t5776>
<t5777>"Actually, I should be the one asking this, what did you mean?"</t5777><t5778></t5778>
<t5779>"For God's sake!" said the king mockingly; "I have no idea...</t5779> <t5780>Maybe you are a sleepwalker and were not aware of what you were doing.</t5780><t5781>"</t5781>
<t5782>The Duke suddenly fumed:</t5782>
<t5783>“Keep your damn nonsense to yourself; do you think I'm a fool?</t5783> <t5784>Do you think I don't know who hid the money in the coffin?</t5784><t5785>”</t5785>
<t5786>“Yes, sir! I am aware that you know, because you are the one hiding the money!</t5786><t5787>”</t5787>
<t5788>“A blatant lie!” The Duke suddenly lunged at him.</t5788> <t5789>The King began to shout:</t5789>
<t5790>"Get your hands off me!..</t5790> <t5791>Stop choking me!..</t5791> <t5792>I take back everything I said!</t5792><t5793>"</t5793>
<t5794>“First, admit your crime,” said the duke.</t5794> <t5795>“Say that you hid the money there, planned to leave me after a few days, return, and dig up the money.</t5795><t5796>”</t5796>
<t5797>“Wait a moment, Duke…</t5797> <t5798>Just answer one question honestly; if you didn't put the money there, tell me, and I will believe you and take back everything I said.</t5798><t5799>”</t5799>
<t5800>“You old swindler, of course I didn't put it, and you know it very well.</t5800> <t5801>Got it?</t5801><t5802>”</t5802>
<t5803>“Okay, I believe you too.</t5803> <t5804>But answer one more question for me…</t5804> <t5805>but answer without getting angry; did it never cross your mind to take the money and hide it?</t5805><t5806>”</t5806>
<t5807>The Duke couldn't respond for a while; then he said:</t5807>
<t5808>“Even if I thought about it, it doesn't matter, I didn't do it in the end.</t5808> <t5809>But you didn't just think about it, you did it too.</t5809><t5810>”</t5810>
<t5811>“If I did it, may I never breathe again, duke, I am telling the truth.</t5811> <t5812>I am not saying I didn't think about doing it, because I did; but you…</t5812><t5813>I mean someone else…</t5813> <t5814>Acted before me.</t5814><t5815>”</t5815>
<t5816>“You're lying again!</t5816> <t5817>You did it and you will admit it, or else…</t5817><t5818>”</t5818>
<t5819>The king had started to make wheezing sounds, finally he spoke breathlessly:</t5819>
<t5820>“Alright!..</t5820> <t5821>I did it!”</t5821>
<t5822>Hearing him say this had made me very happy; I felt much lighter compared to before.</t5822> <t5823>Thus, the duke withdrew his hands and said:</t5823>
<t5824>“If you deny your crime again, I will drown you in the water.</t5824> <t5825>You deserve to sit here and cry like a baby...</t5825> <t5826>After what you've done, this is too little for you.</t5826> <t5827>I've never seen an old ostrich like you who is out to devour everything – yet I always trusted you, I considered you like my own father.</t5827> <t5828>If I were in your place, I would wish the ground would swallow me up.</t5828> <t5829>You are so cruel that you wouldn't object to blaming your crime on poor black people.</t5829> <t5830>The foolishness is on me for being naive enough to believe your nonsense.</t5830> <t5831>Damn you, now I understand why you were so eager to cover it up...</t5831> <t5832>You had your eyes on the money I earned from Curcuna and other jobs, you were after taking it all!</t5832><t5833>”</t5833>
<t5834>The king, still sniffling, began to speak hesitantly: "But it was you who suggested making up the deficiency, duke, not me.</t5834><t5835>"</t5835>
<t5836>“Shut up!</t5836> <t5837>I don't want to hear you talk anymore!” said the duke.</t5837> <t5838>“Do you see what you've achieved now?</t5838> <t5839>Not only did they take back all their money, but they also seized our meager possessions.</t5839> <t5840>Go to bed now...</t5840> <t5841>And don't ever talk to me about making up for anything ever again in your life!</t5841><t5842>”</t5842>
<t5843>The king quietly took the bottle of liquor and went into the shelter; soon after, the duke also started drinking from his own bottle; about half an hour later, they were on good terms again, even their bonds had strengthened and become more affectionate; they fell asleep in each other's arms and started snoring.</t5843> <t5844>Both of them seemed to be in high spirits, but the king didn't get drunk enough to deny hiding the money bag again.</t5844> <t5845>This made me feel more at ease and happy.</t5845> <t5846>When they started snoring, Jim and I, of course, talked for a long time, and I told him everything.</t5846>
<t5847>Chapter Thirty-One</t5847>
<t5848>We did not stop in the towns for days again, we went down the river without stopping.</t5848> <t5849>We had now moved well south, the weather had warmed up, and we were far from home.</t5849> <t5850>We had started to see trees covered with Spanish moss, the moss hanging from the branches like long gray beards.</t5850> <t5851>I was seeing this moss for the first time, it had given the forest a very solemn and gloomy atmosphere.</t5851> <t5852>Our swindlers, thinking they were now far enough from danger, started doing business in the towns again.</t5852>
<t5853>First, they organized a meeting against alcohol, but they didn't even get enough money to get drunk.</t5853> <t5854>They established a dance school in another town; but they knew less about dancing than kangaroos; so the moment they started jumping around awkwardly, the townspeople intervened and chased them out of town.</t5854> <t5855>Then they started a public speaking course, but since they couldn't speak very well, the audience cursed and chased them away.</t5855> <t5856>They tried missionary work, spiritualism, medicine, and fortune-telling; they did everything a little bit, but it seemed their luck had run out.</t5856> <t5857>Finally, they were left penniless, lying on a raft slowly drifting down the river, spending half the day thinking without speaking, looking terribly unhappy and hopeless.</t5857>
<t5858>After a while, things started to change; every day, they would huddle together in the shelter for two or three hours, whispering secretly.</t5858> <t5859>Jim and I were on edge.</t5859> <t5860>Their intentions didn't seem very good.</t5860> <t5861>We thought they were making a more diabolical plan than ever.</t5861> <t5862>After talking amongst ourselves many times, we decided that they were either going to rob someone's house or shop, or maybe even print counterfeit money.</t5862> <t5863>We were both scared of this, and we swore that we would never get involved in such crimes, even if it killed us; at the first opportunity, we would get rid of them and immediately escape, leaving them behind.</t5863> <t5864>In the morning, we hid our raft in a safe place about two miles down from a rundown town called Pikesville; the king went ashore and told us to hide until he scouted the town to see if there was any news of the Royal Nonesuch here.</t5864> <t5865>("That means until you find a house to rob," I muttered; "then you'll come back here after robbing the house, and when you don't see anyone, you'll wonder what happened to me, Jim, and the raft...</t5865> <t5866>wonder all you want.") The king also said that if he didn't return by noon, the duke and I should understand that everything was fine and go into town.</t5866>
<t5867>Thus, we continued to wait where we were.</t5867> <t5868>The duke was wandering around restlessly and kept making faces.</t5868> <t5869>He was scolding us for everything, as if he thought we couldn't do anything right; he found fault in even the smallest things.</t5869> <t5870>We had no doubt that something was going on.</t5870> <t5871>By noon, when the king didn't come, I was very happy; at least there would be a change – maybe we could find an opportunity to make the real change we had in mind.</t5871> <t5872>So, we went to town with the duke and started looking for the king. After a while, we found him in the back room of a filthy tavern, dead drunk and in trouble with a few idle men; he was cursing at the top of his lungs and threatening them, but he was so drunk that he couldn't even get up and do anything to them.</t5872> <t5873>The duke also taunted him, calling him an old fool, and the king retorted; suddenly, they started fighting!</t5873> <t5874>I immediately ran outside and started running as fast as I could, skipping along the river path like a deer – because we had found the chance we were looking for, and I was determined to do what was necessary so they would never see me and Jim again.</t5874> <t5875>I reached the raft's location, out of breath but filled with joy, and called out:</t5875>
<t5876>“Untie it, Jim, we can go now!</t5876><t5877>”</t5877>
<t5878>But there was no answer, and no one came out of the shelter.</t5878> <t5879>Jim was not there!</t5879> <t5880>I called out in case he could hear…</t5880> <t5881>I called again, and then again; I ran frantically back and forth in the forest, but it was no use – our Jim had disappeared.</t5881> <t5882>I sat down and started to cry, I couldn't help it.</t5882> <t5883>But I couldn't sit for long.</t5883> <t5884>After a while, I set off thinking about what I could do, and on the way, I came across a boy and asked him if he had seen a strange-looking black man dressed like this and that.</t5884>
<t5885>“I found it,” he said.</t5885>
<t5886>"Where?" I asked.</t5886>
<t5887>“Two miles down, at Silas Phelps' place.</t5887> <t5888>There was a runaway negro, they caught him.</t5888> <t5889>Were you looking for that negro too?</t5889><t5890>”</t5890>
<t5891>“What do you mean, search for him, brother!</t5891> <t5892>A couple of hours ago, I ran into him in the forest, and he said if I made a sound, he would rip my lungs out.</t5892> <t5893>‘Sit down where you are and don't move an inch,’ he said; so I did.</t5893> <t5894>I've been waiting since then, too scared to come out.</t5894><t5895>”</t5895>
<t5896>“You don't need to be afraid anymore, because it can't do anything to you,” he said.</t5896> <t5897>“It escaped from somewhere in the South.</t5897><t5898>”</t5898>
<t5899>“They've done a good job catching him, indeed.</t5899><t5900>”</t5900>
<t5901>"I think so too!"</t5901> <t5902>"A two hundred dollar bounty has been placed on his head."</t5902> <t5903>"It's like finding money on the street."</t5903>
<t5904>“Very true...</t5904> <t5905>I wish I were bigger, then I would have gotten the money; I saw it first.</t5905> <t5906>So who caught it?</t5906><t5907>”</t5907>
<t5908>“An old man…</t5908> <t5909>a stranger…</t5909> <t5910>sold the reward money for forty dollars because he had to go upriver and couldn't wait.</t5910> <t5911>Look at that!</t5911> <t5912>If it were me, I would have waited even seven years.</t5912><t5913>”</t5913>
<t5914>“I would have expected that too,” I said.</t5914> <t5915>“But maybe it doesn't fetch more money if he sold it so cheaply.</t5915> <t5916>Maybe there's something fishy going on.</t5916><t5917>”</t5917>
<t5918>“But everything is by the book.</t5918> <t5919>I saw the advertisement with my own eyes.</t5919> <t5920>It describes the black man in the smallest detail, almost drawing his picture.</t5920> <t5921>Moreover, it also mentioned which plantation below New Orleans he belonged to.</t5921> <t5922>No; brother, I definitely don't think there's anything fishy going on.</t5922> <t5923>If you have any, give me some chewing tobacco.</t5923><t5924>”</t5924>
<t5925>I had no tobacco, the boy left.</t5925> <t5926>So I turned to the shack, went inside the shelter, and started thinking.</t5926> <t5927>Nothing came to my mind.</t5927> <t5928>I thought until my head was about to burst, but I couldn't find a way out of this trouble.</t5928> <t5929>This long journey, all the things we did for those two swindlers, had been in vain, everything was ruined; because they were treacherous enough to play such a trick on Jim; to make him a lifelong slave among strangers for just forty dollars.</t5929>
<t5930>When I thought that if Jim was going to remain a slave where his family found him, it would be a thousand times better for him to be a slave in his own home, I decided it was best to write a letter to Tom Sawyer and ask him to tell Miss Watson where Jim was.</t5930> <t5931>But a little later, I changed my mind, for two reasons: Miss Watson would be very angry and hate him for the lowliness and treachery of abandoning her, so she would sell him down the river again; even if she didn't sell him, everyone naturally hates a treacherous black man and they would constantly make Jim feel this, so he would feel base and dishonored.</t5931> <t5932>And what about me?</t5932> <t5933>Everyone would hear that Huck Finn helped a black man gain freedom; I would have to bow my head and lick their boots in shame whenever I saw anyone from that town.</t5933> <t5934>That's how it always is: Someone does something despicable, and then doesn't want to face the consequences.</t5934> <t5935>As long as he can hide his fault, he assumes he hasn't done anything shameful.</t5935> <t5936>I had fallen into exactly such a predicament.</t5936> <t5937>The more I thought about what I had done, the more my conscience troubled me, and I felt increasingly base and despicable.</t5937> <t5938>Finally, I decided it was clear that God's blow had suddenly struck my face; it reminded me that my sins had been seen from above from the beginning, that God had witnessed me stealing the black man of a poor old woman who had never harmed me, and that He would not allow such vile sins to continue; I was so scared that I nearly lost my mind.</t5938> <t5939>Yet I did my best to find excuses for the mischief I had done; I said that I had been raised as a sinner, so it wasn't my fault; but still, a voice inside me said: "There was the church's Sunday school, you could have gone there; if you had gone, they would have taught you the right thing, they would have told you that those who treat blacks the way you do will burn in hell forever.</t5939><t5940>"</t5940>
<t5941>I shivered from head to toe.</t5941> <t5942>I decided to pray, maybe I could stop being a sinful child and try to be better.</t5942> <t5943>I knelt down.</t5943> <t5944>But the words just wouldn't come to my mind.</t5944> <t5945>Why wouldn't they come?</t5945> <t5946>It was impossible to hide from God what a servant knew.</t5946> <t5947>I couldn't hide it from myself either.</t5947> <t5948>I knew very well why the words wouldn't come to my mind.</t5948> <t5949>Because I wasn't praying from the heart, because I wasn't being honest, because I was being hypocritical.</t5949> <t5950>I wanted to say that I would stop sinning, but something inside me insisted on one of the greatest sins.</t5950> <t5951>I was trying to open my mouth to say that I would do the right thing, clean up the mess I had made, and write to the owner of the black man to inform him of his whereabouts; but deep down I knew it was a lie – God knew it too.</t5951> <t5952>You can't pray falsely – this is what I learned.</t5952>
<t5953>I was in such great distress that I was at a loss for what to do.</t5953> <t5954>Finally, an idea came to my mind; I thought to myself, let me go and write this letter, and then try to pray.</t5954> <t5955>Strangely enough, I suddenly felt as light as a feather, all my troubles had almost vanished.</t5955> <t5956>I took paper and pen and started writing with joy and excitement:</t5956>
<t5957>Miss Watson, your runaway negro Jim is two miles below Pikesville, in the hands of Mr. Phelps, and if you send the reward, he will send your negro to you.</t5957>
<t5958>HUCK FINN</t5958>
<t5959>I now felt as if I had done a good deed and, for the first time in my life, cleansed of sin; now I could pray.</t5959> <t5960>But I didn't start praying right away; I put down the paper and began to think – how good it was that things had ended this way, how close I had come to going down the wrong path and ending up in hell, I had narrowly escaped at the last moment.</t5960> <t5961>The more I thought, the more I thought.</t5961> <t5962>Then I started thinking about our journey down the river; the nights, the days, sometimes in the moonlight, sometimes in the storm, the moments I spent with Jim came to mind; we had traveled down the river for so long, talked, sung songs, laughed, and had fun.</t5962> <t5963>But for some reason, I had no memory that would harden my heart against him; on the contrary, I remembered things that softened it.</t5963> <t5964>I remembered how he took my watch after his own, how he couldn't bring himself to wake me up, how happy he was when I returned from the fog, how delighted he was when we met in the swamp where there was a blood feud; many similar things came to mind; he always called me the apple of his eye, patted my head, did everything he could think of for my comfort, always treated me well; lastly, I remembered the night I saved him by telling the men there were flowers on the raft, how grateful he was, how he said I was the best friend he had in this world, even his only friend now; as I thought about these things, I looked around and saw the paper.</t5964>
<t5965>It was right in front of me.</t5965> <t5966>I took the paper and held it in my hand.</t5966> <t5967>I was trembling because I knew I had to make a definite choice between two paths.</t5967> <t5968>I looked at the paper a bit more, held my breath, and finally said to myself:</t5968>
<t5969>“Whatever, if I go to hell, I go to hell.”</t5969> <t5970>I tore up the paper and threw it away.</t5970>
<t5971>These were terrible thoughts and terrible words, but they had already come out of my mouth.</t5971> <t5972>I didn't feel like taking them back, and from that day on, I didn't even think about changing my mind.</t5972> <t5973>From that moment on, I pushed them all out of my mind; I would continue to sin, because this was my path, I was raised for this, I couldn't follow another path.</t5973> <t5974>Now, what I needed to do was find a way to free Jim from slavery again; if I had to do something worse for this, I would do it, because I was already neck-deep in this and I wouldn't be able to sleep peacefully until I finished it completely.</t5974>
<t5975>I started making plans to rescue Jim and mulled over a lot of ideas in my mind; finally, I settled on one plan.</t5975> <t5976>I set my sights on a densely wooded island down the river, and as soon as it got dark, I emerged from my hiding place with my raft and headed for the island. I hid the raft on the island and lay down to sleep.</t5976> <t5977>I slept soundly through the night, woke up before dawn, had breakfast, put on the new clothes I had bought from the store, bundled up the others, got into the canoe, and went ashore.</t5977> <t5978>I made sure to land somewhere near Phelps' farm, hid my bundle in the woods, filled the canoe with water, put a few stones in it, and sank it at a spot where I could find it later, about a quarter mile down from a sawmill on a small creek that flowed into the river.</t5978>
<t5979>I set out, and as I passed by the sawmill, I saw a sign that read "Phelps' Sawmill." When I reached the area of the farmhouses about two or three hundred meters away, I kept my eyes wide open and scouted the surroundings, but despite it being almost daylight, there was no one around.</t5979> <t5980>There wasn't supposed to be anyone anyway, because I didn't want to see anyone yet – I was just trying to get familiar with the area.</t5980> <t5981>According to my plan, they would see me coming from the direction of the town, not from below.</t5981> <t5982>So I just took a look around and headed straight towards the town.</t5982> <t5983>When I arrived in town, the first person I saw was the duke.</t5983> <t5984>He was putting up posters for the Royal Nonesuch – a three-night show – just like last time.</t5984> <t5985>How brazen these conmen were!</t5985> <t5986>Since we ran into each other suddenly, I couldn't escape from there.</t5986> <t5987>He looked at me in astonishment:</t5987>
<t5988>"Oh my goodness!"</t5988> <t5989>"Where did you come from?"</t5989> <t5990>Then, with joy and eagerness, "Where is Sal?</t5990> <t5991>Did you find a good place?" he asked.</t5991>
<t5992>"I was just about to ask you the same thing, your excellency."</t5992><t5993>"</t5993>
<t5994>Suddenly, his mood soured.</t5994>
<t5995>“What do you mean you were going to ask me?</t5995><t5996>”</t5996>
<t5997>“When I saw the king in the tavern yesterday, I thought we wouldn't be able to take him anywhere for a few more hours until he sobered up; so I started wandering around the town to pass the time.</t5997> <t5998>A man offered me ten cents to take a sheep across the river with a boat and come back, and I accepted; but while pulling the sheep onto the boat, the man left the rope with me for a moment to push the sheep from behind, but the sheep was stronger than me and suddenly broke free and ran away, so we chased after it.</t5998> <t5999>Since we didn't have a dog, we had to chase it over hills and valleys until it got tired.</t5999> <t6000>We couldn't catch it until it got dark, but finally we caught it and took it across, and I headed towards the raft.</t6000> <t6001>When I came to the place where we had hidden the raft and couldn't find it, I thought, ‘It seems they got into trouble and had to leave; they took my nigger too, the only nigger I had in this world, and now I'm left in a foreign land without any possessions, penniless, and there's nothing I can do to earn a living,’ I said to myself; I sat down and started to cry.</t6001> <t6002>I slept in the forest that night.</t6002> <t6003>So what happened to the raft then?</t6003> <t6004>And Jim, poor Jim!</t6004><t6005>”</t6005>
<t6006>“If I know what happened to the raft, I am a scoundrel.</t6006> <t6007>That old fool had sold something and gotten forty dollars; when we found him in the tavern, ruffians had swarmed around him and taken every last cent from him through trickery, except for the money he had spent on whiskey. Late in the evening, when we took him back and noticed the raft was gone, we said, ‘That little rascal stole our raft and took our belongings down the river.’</t6007><t6008>”</t6008>
<t6009>“But I'm not going to leave my black man behind, am I?</t6009> <t6010>In this world, I have only one black man; I have no other possessions.</t6010><t6011>”</t6011>
<t6012>“This had never crossed our minds.</t6012> <t6013>To be honest, we had started to see him as our own black person; yes, we were now looking at him as our black person...</t6013> <t6014>God knows he didn't suffer any less because of us.</t6014> <t6015>When Sal left, we were left penniless and had no choice but to try Curcuna at the Palace again.</t6015> <t6016>Since then, even the last pennies in my pocket are gone, I'm dried up.</t6016> <t6017>Is that ten cents still there?</t6017> <t6018>Give it to me.</t6018><t6019>”</t6019>
<t6020>I had enough money, so I gave him ten cents, but I begged him to use it to buy something to eat, and he had to share the food with me because I had no other money and hadn't eaten anything since yesterday.</t6020> <t6021>He didn't say a word.</t6021> <t6022>But a moment later, he turned to me in a hurry and said:</t6022>
<t6023>“Do you think that black man will report us?</t6023> <t6024>If he does, we'll skin him alive!</t6024><t6025>”</t6025>
<t6026>“Where is he reporting?</t6026> <t6027>Didn't he run away?</t6027><t6028>”</t6028>
<t6029>“No! Our old fool sold it and didn't share the money with me, and now he is also penniless.</t6029><t6030>”</t6030>
<t6031>“Did he sell him?” I started crying; “but he was my black man and the money was my money.</t6031> <t6032>Where is he now?</t6032> <t6033>I want my black man back.</t6033><t6034>”</t6034>
<t6035>“You can't get your money back, so stop whining.</t6035> <t6036>Look at me… do you think he can risk reporting us?</t6036> <t6037>I don't trust you much either.</t6037> <t6038>If you also try to report us…</t6038><t6039>”</t6039>
<t6040>He was silent, but I had never seen the shopkeeper look this angry.</t6040> <t6041>I continued to complain:</t6041>
<t6042>“I don't want to report anyone, I don't have time for that anyway.</t6042> <t6043>I just want to go and find my black man.</t6043><t6044>”</t6044>
<t6045>He hesitated for a moment, rubbing his forehead while the flyers under his arm fluttered in the wind, and paused to think.</t6045> <t6046>Finally, he spoke:</t6046>
<t6047>“Listen carefully.</t6047> <t6048>We will stay here for three days.</t6048> <t6049>If you promise not to report us, and that the black man won't report us either, I will tell you where to find him.</t6049><t6050>”</t6050>
<t6051>I promised her.</t6051>
<t6052>“The name of the farmer who took him is Silas Ph…” then he fell silent.</t6052> <t6053>He was actually going to tell me the truth, but then he stopped and reconsidered, and as far as I could understand, he changed his mind.</t6053> <t6054>Apparently, he had concluded that he couldn't trust me and thought it best for me to stay out of the way for three days.</t6054> <t6055>A little later, he said:</t6055>
<t6056>“The name of the man who took it is Abram Foster…</t6056> <t6057>Abram G.</t6057> <t6058>Foster…</t6058> <t6059>He lives forty miles from here, inland on the Lafayette road.</t6059><t6060>”</t6060>
<t6061>“Okay, I can walk there in three days,” I said.</t6061> <t6062>“It would be good to start right this afternoon.</t6062><t6063>”</t6063>
<t6064>“No, you must start immediately,” he said.</t6064> <t6065>“Do not waste any time, do not dawdle on the road.</t6065> <t6066>Keep your mouth shut along the way and walk without stopping, then you won't have any problems with us, do you hear me?</t6066><t6067>”</t6067>
<t6068>I was already waiting for this order and trying to hear it.</t6068> <t6069>I wanted to be left alone to implement my own plan.</t6069>
<t6070>“Get lost,” he said; “You can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want.</t6070> <t6071>Maybe you can convince him that Jim is your slave...</t6071> <t6072>Some fools don't ask for documents...</t6072> <t6073>At least I've heard that there are some who don't ask for documents this far South.</t6073> <t6074>If you tell him that the advertisement and the reward are fake, that you made it all up to keep others away from your slave, he might believe you.</t6074> <t6075>Now go and tell him whatever you want; but make sure it's your feet doing the work, not your mouth, between here and there.</t6075><t6076>”</t6076>
<t6077>So I left there and set off inward.</t6077> <t6078>I wasn't looking around, but I could feel him watching me.</t6078> <t6079>Of course, I knew I would tire him out soon enough.</t6079> <t6080>I walked about a mile through the fields, then turned back and headed towards the Phelps farm through the forest.</t6080> <t6081>I had to start executing my plan immediately without lingering around, because I wanted to keep Jim's mouth shut until these scoundrels left.</t6081> <t6082>I didn't want to get into trouble with people like them.</t6082> <t6083>I'd already had enough trouble with them, there was no need to face them again.</t6083>
<t6084>Chapter Thirty-Two</t6084>
<t6085>When I arrived there, the surroundings were as calm as a Sunday, and it was also hot and sunny; the laborers had gone to the fields; there was a faint buzzing of insects and flies in the air, I felt very lonely and deserted, as if everyone except me had died and gone away.</t6085> <t6086>It was such a weather that if a breeze rustled the leaves, you would feel sorrowful, because it would seem as if spirits –even those that had been dead for many years– were whispering, and you would always think they were talking about you.</t6086> <t6087>In fact, generally in the face of such a thing, one comes to wish that they too had died and severed their connection with this world.</t6087>
<t6088>The Phelps' farm was one of the small cotton plantations, all of which are similar to each other.</t6088> <t6089>The two-acre yard was surrounded by a fence; logs cut into slices and arranged in steps of varying heights like barrels served both to climb the fence and to help women mount horses; in the wide yard, there were patches of yellowed grass here and there, but most of the yard was bare and flat, looking like an old hat with its nap worn off; a large two-story wooden house was built for the whites – the gaps in the walls made of logs smoothed with an ax were filled with mud or adobe, and these strips of mortar had been whitewashed at some point.</t6089> <t6090>The kitchen, with its round log walls, was connected to the house by a wide, open but roofed passage.</t6090> <t6091>Behind the kitchen, there was another wooden shack used for smoking, and beyond that, there were three negro cabins.</t6091> <t6092>A small cabin stood alone leaning against the back fences, with an ash silo and a large cauldron for soap making right next to it.</t6092> <t6093>On a table next to the kitchen door, there was a bucket of water and a gourd dipper.</t6093> <t6094>A hunting dog had curled up and fallen asleep right there in the sun; there were other dogs sleeping around as well.</t6094> <t6095>Three large trees in the corner shaded the yard.</t6095> <t6096>A grapevine covered part of the fence, outside the fence there was a vegetable garden and a watermelon field, and beyond that, the cotton fields began, and after the fields, there was a forest.</t6096>
<t6097>I wandered around and entered the courtyard by climbing the steps near the ash silo, then headed towards the kitchen.</t6097> <t6098>As I moved a little further, I heard the whirring of a pulley rising and falling; that's when I thought, God take my life and save me – there is no sound that makes a person feel so lonely.</t6098>
<t6099>I continued on my way without a specific plan, trusting that God would give me the right words when the time came; because I had realized that if I let myself relax, God always made me say the right words.</t6099>
<t6100>When I was halfway down the road, first one dog, then another dog got up and came towards me, so I immediately stopped and started waiting without moving, of course.</t6100> <t6101>The barking of the dogs raised a commotion!</t6101> <t6102>After about fifteen seconds, I had become like the hub of a wheel, with the spokes of the wheel made up of dogs; around fifteen dogs had gathered around me, stretching their necks and noses towards me, barking or howling; other dogs were also coming; I could see them jumping over fences, darting out from every conceivable corner.</t6102>
<t6103>A black woman rushed out of the kitchen with a rolling pin in her hand.</t6103> <t6104>"Shoo! Come on, back off!</t6104> <t6105>Come on, Çomar! Hop, shoo!" she shouted, hitting first one and then the other with the rolling pin; the dogs howled and retreated, and the rest quickly scattered; a moment later, half of them came back, wagging their tails and started circling around me, trying to befriend me.</t6105> <t6106>After all, dogs don't harm humans.</t6106>
<t6107>A small black girl and two black boys came out after the black woman; the children wore nothing but linen shirts and were all clinging to the hem of their mother's dress, casting shy and furtive glances at me from behind her; children are always like that anyway.</t6107> <t6108>A white woman, around forty-five or fifty years old, came out of the house with her head uncovered; she still had a distaff in her hand; white children followed her, behaving just like the black children.</t6108> <t6109>The woman's mouth was stretched to her ears, she looked as if she might collapse from smiling:</t6109>
<t6110>“You finally came!..</t6110> <t6111>It's you, isn't it?</t6111><t6112>”</t6112>
<t6113>Before I had time to think, the words "Yes, ma'am," had already slipped out of my mouth.</t6113>
<t6114>As soon as the woman caught me, she took me into her arms; then she started shaking both of my hands; tears were streaming down her cheeks; it seemed like she couldn't get enough of hugging and shaking my hand.</t6114> <t6115>"You don't look as much like your mother as I thought, but it doesn't matter at all, I'm so glad to see you!" she said.</t6115> <t6116>"Oh my dear, I could just eat those cheeks of yours!</t6116> <t6117>Kids, your cousin Tom is here!..</t6117> <t6118>Say welcome to him.</t6118><t6119>"</t6119>
<t6120>But the little ones hid even further behind their mother, watching me with their fingers in their mouths.</t6120> <t6121>The woman called out inside:</t6121>
<t6122>“Lize, quickly prepare a hot breakfast for him…</t6122> <t6123>Or did you have breakfast on the ferry?</t6123><t6124>”</t6124>
<t6125>I said that I had breakfast on the ferry.</t6125> <t6126>Upon this, he grabbed my hand and dragged me towards the house, with the children following us.</t6126> <t6127>When we arrived at the house, he sat me down on a wicker chair, and he settled on a small stool directly opposite me. Taking my hands in his palms, he began to speak again:</t6127>
<t6128>“Now let me take a good look at you; My God, I have wanted to see you for so many years, and finally, we have met!</t6128> <t6129>We were expecting you a few days ago.</t6129> <t6130>Why were you so late?..</t6130> <t6131>Did the steamer run aground?</t6131><t6132>”</t6132>
<t6133>“Yes, ma'am...</t6133><t6134>”</t6134>
<t6135>"Don't call me ma'am, call me Aunt Sally."</t6135> <t6136>"Where did it run aground?"</t6136><t6137></t6137>
<t6138>Suddenly, I didn't know what to say because I didn't know whether the steamboat was coming from upstream or downstream.</t6138> <t6139>But the best thing was to trust my instincts; according to my instincts, the steamboat was coming from downstream, from the direction of Orleans.</t6139> <t6140>But this information was of no use to me because I didn't know where the steamboat could run aground on its way here.</t6140> <t6141>So, I would either have to make up a name of a sandbar or say that I forgot where we ran aground...</t6141> <t6142>Then another idea suddenly came to my mind:</t6142>
<t6143>“The reason for our delay was not that we ran aground.</t6143> <t6144>One of the cylinder heads exploded.</t6144><t6145>”</t6145>
<t6146>"Oh my God! Did anything happen to anyone?"</t6146><t6147>"</t6147>
<t6148>“No, ma'am.</t6148> <t6149>Only a black man died.</t6149><t6150>”</t6150>
<t6151>“Anyway, you were lucky; because sometimes people get hurt too.</t6151> <t6152>Two years ago, around Christmas time, Uncle Silas was coming from New Orleans with the old Lally Rook when the steamboat's cylinder cover exploded and a man was crippled.</t6152> <t6153>I think he died later.</t6153> <t6154>The man was a Baptist.</t6154> <t6155>Uncle Silas knew a family from Baton Rouge who knew that family well.</t6155> <t6156>Yes, now I remember, the man had died.</t6156> <t6157>He got gangrene, and they had to amputate one of his limbs.</t6157> <t6158>But he still couldn't be saved.</t6158> <t6159>Of course, he had gangrene…</t6159> <t6160>now I remember.</t6160> <t6161>The man turned purple and died with the hope of resurrection by God's grace on Judgment Day.</t6161> <t6162>They say he had a very strange appearance.</t6162> <t6163>Uncle went to town every day to bring you.</t6163> <t6164>He went to town again about an hour ago; he will be here soon.</t6164> <t6165>You must have met him on the way…</t6165> <t6166>An elderly man…</t6166><t6167>”</t6167>
<t6168>“No, I didn't see anyone, Aunt Sally.</t6168> <t6169>The ferry arrived at dawn, and I left my belongings on a ship at the dock and wandered around the town a bit, and then in the countryside; I thought I’d pass the time so I wouldn’t arrive here too early; that’s why I came from the back.</t6169><t6170>”</t6170>
<t6171>“To whom did you leave your belongings?</t6171><t6172>”</t6172>
<t6173>“To no one.</t6173><t6174>”</t6174>
<t6175>“But they will steal, my nephew!</t6175><t6176>”</t6176>
<t6177>"No one can find it where I have hidden it," I said.</t6177>
<t6178>“So, how did you have breakfast on the ferry so early in the morning?</t6178><t6179>”</t6179>
<t6180>I felt cornered, but I immediately responded:</t6180>
<t6181>“The captain saw me wandering around and told me to eat something before going ashore; he took me to the place where the officers eat in the captain's cabin and I ate everything I wanted.</t6181><t6182>”</t6182>
<t6183>I was so on edge that I couldn't properly understand what was being said.</t6183> <t6184>My mind was always on the children; I wanted to pull them aside and press them a bit to find out who I was.</t6184> <t6185>But I couldn't find an opportunity.</t6185> <t6186>Mrs. Phelps kept talking nonstop.</t6186> <t6187>Soon, I shivered from head to toe because she said:</t6187>
<t6188>“But I've been talking for two hours and you haven't said a word about your brother or anyone else.</t6188> <t6189>Now let me rest a bit and you tell me; tell me everything...</t6189> <t6190>Are they in good health, what are they doing, what did they tell you to convey to me; tell me everything that comes to your mind.</t6190><t6191>”</t6191>
<t6192>This time I was in a real fix – I was truly stuck.</t6192> <t6193>Until that moment, God had been my helper, but from then on, there was no corner left to escape to.</t6193> <t6194>There was no point in pretending any longer...</t6194> <t6195>It was time to throw in the towel.</t6195> <t6196>Here was another situation where I had to risk telling the truth, I said to myself.</t6196> <t6197>Just as I was about to open my mouth, the woman grabbed me and pushed me to the back of the bed.</t6197>
<t6198>"Here comes your brother-in-law!"</t6198> <t6199>"Hide there immediately..."</t6199> <t6200>"hah, perfect; now no one can see you."</t6200> <t6201>"Don't let on that you're here."</t6201> <t6202>"We're going to play a good prank on your brother-in-law now."</t6202> <t6203>"Kids, don't let anything slip from your mouths."</t6203><t6204>"</t6204>
<t6205>I had no way out anymore.</t6205> <t6206>But at that moment, there was no point in worrying; there was nothing I could do except stand still where I was, and then I would try to stay standing when the lightning struck:</t6206>
<t6207>I saw the elderly gentleman who entered for a moment, then his face remained at the top of the bed.</t6207> <t6208>Ms. Phelps jumped towards him excitedly:</t6208>
<t6209>"Has he/she/it arrived?"</t6209><t6210>"</t6210>
<t6211>“No,” said her husband.</t6211>
<t6212>“Wow wow!” said the woman, “I wonder if something happened to him?</t6212><t6213>”</t6213>
<t6214>"I don't know," said the old gentleman; "to be honest, I'm very worried.</t6214><t6215>"</t6215>
<t6216>“Are you worried!” said his wife, “I'm about to lose my mind!</t6216> <t6217>He should have arrived by now, maybe you didn't see him.</t6217> <t6218>I'm sure you didn't see him...</t6218> <t6219>A voice inside me says so.</t6219><t6220>”</t6220>
<t6221>“There’s no way I can pass by without seeing him, Sally… you know that very well.</t6221><t6222>”</t6222>
<t6223>“Oh my God, what will my sister say about this?</t6223> <t6224>She should have arrived by now!</t6224> <t6225>You must have definitely missed her.</t6225><t6226>”</t6226>
<t6227>“I’m already eating myself up inside, don’t pressure me any more.</t6227> <t6228>I really don’t know what I can do.</t6228> <t6229>I’ve reached the end of my patience and I’ve been on edge since morning.</t6229> <t6230>But there’s no way it could have arrived, because if it had, it wouldn’t have missed me.</t6230> <t6231>Sally, this is very terrible… very much so…</t6231> <t6232>something definitely happened to the ferry!</t6232><t6233>”</t6233>
<t6234>“Silas! Look over there!</t6234> <t6235>Is someone coming down the road?</t6235><t6236>”</t6236>
<t6237>Adam immediately rushed to the window at the head of the bed, and thus Mrs. Phelps found the opportunity she was looking for.</t6237> <t6238>She quickly reached towards the foot of the bed and pulled me out; when the man turned back, Mrs. Phelps was grinning with all her teeth showing, and I was standing beside her obediently and drenched in sweat.</t6238> <t6239>The old man stared intently:</t6239>
<t6240>“Who is this?</t6240><t6241>”</t6241>
<t6242>“Who are you?</t6242><t6243>”</t6243>
<t6244>"I have no idea.</t6244> <t6245>Who was it?</t6245><t6246>"</t6246>
<t6247>"It's Tom Sawyer himself!"</t6247><t6248>"</t6248>
<t6249>My God, my knees gave way, I almost fell to the ground.</t6249> <t6250>But before I could pull myself together, the old man hugged me and shook my hand; while he was shaking my hand, the woman was jumping around us, both laughing and crying; then both of them started bombarding me with questions about Sid, Mary, and the rest of the tribe.</t6250>
<t6251>They were very happy, but I couldn't contain my joy; because I felt like I was reborn, I was very pleased to learn who I was.</t6251> <t6252>They continued with their questions for two hours; finally, my jaw was too tired to speak; I had told them so much about my family – that is, the Sawyer family – that it would have been enough for at least six Sawyer families.</t6252> <t6253>I also told them how the cylinder head blew at the mouth of the White River and how they spent three days repairing it.</t6253> <t6254>There was no problem here either, in fact, it was quite convincing; because they had no idea whether it would take three days to repair a cylinder head.</t6254> <t6255>They would probably have believed me just as much if I had said a bolt had broken.</t6255>
<t6256>While on one hand I felt very comfortable, on the other hand I didn't feel comfortable at all.</t6256> <t6257>Being Tom Sawyer was very easy and comfortable; this ease and comfort lasted until I heard the sound of a steamboat from the river – but then I said to myself, what if Tom Sawyer is on that steamboat?</t6257> <t6258>What if he suddenly appears and says my name before I can even wink at him to keep quiet?</t6258>
<t6259>I couldn't allow this – then all my plans would be ruined.</t6259> <t6260>I had to go up the road and meet him.</t6260> <t6261>So I told my aunts that I would go to town and get my things.</t6261> <t6262>The big man was going to come with me, but I didn't agree, I could ride the horse by myself, there was no need for him to bother.</t6262>
<t6263>Thirty-Third Chapter</t6263>
<t6264>So I jumped into the car and set off towards the town; I had just reached halfway when I saw a car coming from the opposite direction.</t6264> <t6265>I immediately recognized Tom Sawyer, stopped where I was, and waited until he approached.</t6265> <t6266>When I shouted "Stop!", the driver pulled the reins right beside me.</t6266> <t6267>Tom stared with his mouth open, then after swallowing two or three times as if his throat was dry, he managed to speak:</t6267>
<t6268>"I had never done anything bad to you.</t6268> <t6269>You know this.</t6269> <t6270>Why did you come back to haunt me now?</t6270><t6271>"</t6271>
<t6272>“I didn't come back,” I said, “because I never left.</t6272><t6273>”</t6273>
<t6274>When he heard my voice, he came to his senses a bit, but he was still not fully convinced.</t6274>
<t6275>“Don't play games with me, have I ever played with you?</t6275> <t6276>Tell the truth, are you a ghost or not?</t6276><t6277>”</t6277>
<t6278>“I'm telling the truth, I'm not,” I said.</t6278>
<t6279>“Well then… I… I… now I believe of course; but I still can't understand.</t6279> <t6280>Weren't you killed?</t6280><t6281>”</t6281>
<t6282>"Yo.</t6282> <t6283>I wasn't killed...</t6283> <t6284>I had arranged everything.</t6284> <t6285>If you don't believe me, come and touch me.</t6285><t6286>"</t6286>
<t6287>When he finally touched me, he believed it, he was so happy to see me again that he didn't know what to do.</t6287> <t6288>He immediately wanted me to tell him everything because I had experienced a tremendous and mysterious adventure, which was just his kind of thing.</t6288> <t6289>But I said we should leave the talking for later; I asked the driver to wait a bit and took Tom aside.</t6289> <t6290>I told him what kind of trouble we were in and asked what the best solution would be.</t6290> <t6291>He asked me to leave him alone for a minute and not to disturb him at all.</t6291> <t6292>After thinking deeply for a while, he turned to me:</t6292>
<t6293>“Alright, I found it.</t6293> <t6294>Let's put my stuff in your car, and you'll act like it's your stuff.</t6294> <t6295>Now go back and slowly head towards home, you should return at the time you are supposed to.</t6295> <t6296>I'll first go back to the town, then I'll hit the road again and follow you fifteen minutes or half an hour later.</t6296> <t6297>At first, don't let on that you know me.</t6297><t6298>”</t6298>
<t6299>“Alright, but wait a minute,” I said.</t6299> <t6300>“There is one more issue…</t6300> <t6301>An issue that no one else knows but me.</t6301> <t6302>There is a black man here whom I am trying to free from slavery…</t6302> <t6303>His name is Jim… he is Miss Watson’s black man.</t6303><t6304>”</t6304>
<t6305>“What did you say?</t6305> <t6306>But Jim…</t6306><t6307>”</t6307>
<t6308>He suddenly fell silent and began to think again.</t6308>
<t6309>“I know what you're going to say,” I said.</t6309> <t6310>“You're going to say that this is a very dirty and vile job, but no matter what...</t6310> <t6311>I accept its vileness and I will definitely save him, so I want you to stay silent and not let anyone suspect anything.</t6311> <t6312>Will you do this?</t6312><t6313>”</t6313>
<t6314>Tom's eyes sparkled.</t6314>
<t6315>"I will help you save him!</t6315><t6316>"</t6316>
<t6317>I was almost speechless with astonishment.</t6317> <t6318>These were the most surprising words that had ever come out of Tom's mouth until that day...</t6318> <t6319>Additionally, I must say that Tom Sawyer had significantly fallen in my esteem.</t6319> <t6320>But on the other hand, I couldn't believe it.</t6320> <t6321>Tom Sawyer, the Negro thief!</t6321>
<t6322>“No way, you must be joking,” I said.</t6322>
<t6323>“I am not joking at all.</t6323><t6324>”</t6324>
<t6325>“Anyway, whether it's a joke or not, if you hear talk about a runaway black man, don't let on that you know anything, remember I don't know anything either.</t6325><t6326>”</t6326>
<t6327>Then we took the chest and put it in my car, he went his way, and I went mine.</t6327> <t6328>But of course, I had completely forgotten what he said about driving slowly, I was very happy and my head was full of thoughts; I returned home in an unusually short time for that journey.</t6328> <t6329>The old man was standing at the door:</t6329>
<t6330>“Isn't this wonderful?</t6330> <t6331>Who would have guessed that this mare could accomplish such a feat.</t6331> <t6332>I thought she was getting old.</t6332> <t6333>And she hasn't even broken a sweat, wow.</t6333> <t6334>Truly magnificent.</t6334> <t6335>Now, I'll sell this horse to anyone who kisses my hand for a hundred dollars; whereas this morning, I was lamenting that she wasn't even worth fifteen dollars and thought I couldn't ask for more.</t6335><t6336>”</t6336>
<t6337>He didn't say anything else.</t6337> <t6338>He was the kindest-hearted, most well-intentioned man I had ever seen until that day.</t6338> <t6339>But this was not surprising, because he was not only a farmer but also a priest, and he had a tiny church at the back of the plantation.</t6339> <t6340>He had paid for the expenses of the church and the classroom out of his own pocket, and despite giving very good sermons, he didn't take a penny from anyone.</t6340> <t6341>There are many farmer-priests like him in the South, and they all behave the same way.</t6341>
<t6342>About half an hour later, Tom's car appeared on the road in front, and since the road was only about fifty meters away, Aunt Sally immediately noticed:</t6342>
<t6343>“Aaa, someone is coming!</t6343> <t6344>I wonder who?</t6344> <t6345>It seems to be a stranger.</t6345> <t6346>Jimmy (it was the name of one of the children) run and tell Lize to set another plate on the table.</t6346><t6347>”</t6347>
<t6348>Everyone rushed to the front door, because it was not common for a stranger to come to the farm.</t6348> <t6349>So the arrival of a stranger caused more excitement than the arrival of yellow fever.</t6349> <t6350>Tom was coming towards the house, having passed the fences, the car had turned towards the town, and we were all gathered at the front door.</t6350> <t6351>Tom was wearing brand new clothes; and there was a large audience in front of him...</t6351> <t6352>This was his moment to shine.</t6352> <t6353>It was hard to even imagine how he would show off under such circumstances.</t6353> <t6354>He was coming not meekly like a lamb, but upright like a ram.</t6354> <t6355>The way he took off his hat and greeted us, you would think he was trying not to disturb the delicate butterflies sleeping underneath it.</t6355>
<t6356>"Am I honored to meet Mr. Archibald Nichols?" he said.</t6356>
<t6357>“No; my son,” said the old man, “unfortunately, the coachman has deceived you; Nichols's house is three miles down the road.</t6357> <t6358>Come inside.</t6358> <t6359>Come inside.</t6359><t6360>”</t6360>
<t6361>Tom turned and looked over his shoulder.</t6361> <t6362>"Too late... it's out of sight," he said.</t6362>
<t6363>“Yes, he left, my son, you should come and eat with us; after that, we will get in my car and I will take you to the Nichols’ place.</t6363><t6364>”</t6364>
<t6365>"Well, I don't want to trouble you that much; absolutely not.</t6365> <t6366>I'll walk...</t6366> <t6367>It's not very far.</t6367><t6368>"</t6368>
<t6369>“But I can't let you walk...</t6369> <t6370>It wouldn't befit Southern hospitality.</t6370> <t6371>Come inside immediately.</t6371><t6372>”</t6372>
<t6373>“Please come in,” said Aunt Sally; “it’s no trouble for us at all, it’s nothing really.</t6373> <t6374>You must stay for a while.</t6374> <t6375>The road is three miles but everything is covered in dust, we can’t let you walk.</t6375> <t6376>In fact, when I saw you coming, I told them to set another plate at the table, don’t disappoint us.</t6376> <t6377>Come in and make yourself at home.</t6377><t6378>”</t6378>
<t6379>Tom sincerely and gracefully thanked them, entered without further ado; after entering, he said he was a stranger from Hicksville, Ohio, that his name was William Thompson, and bowed again in greeting.</t6379>
<t6380>So he went on and on, making up a bunch of things about Hicksville and the people living there; I was starting to get tense.</t6380> <t6381>I was wondering how any of this would provide a solution to our situation; finally, without stopping his speech, he leaned over and kissed Aunt Sally on the mouth, then sat back down in his chair and settled in, about to continue his words when Aunt Sally suddenly jumped up, wiped her lips with the back of her hand, and shouted:</t6381>
<t6382>"You shameless dog!</t6382><t6383>"</t6383>
<t6384>Tom looked at her as if he were hurt:</t6384>
<t6385>"You surprised me a lot, ma'am.</t6385><t6386>"</t6386>
<t6387>“Surprised?</t6387> <t6388>Did I surprise you?</t6388> <t6389>Now I will show you…</t6389> <t6390>What are you trying to do?</t6390><t6391>”</t6391>
<t6392>Tom answered with a modest demeanor:</t6392>
<t6393>“Nothing, ma'am.</t6393> <t6394>I had no ill intentions.</t6394> <t6395>I thought you would like it.</t6395><t6396>”</t6396>
<t6397>"Yes, you little fool!" He grabbed the spindle stick, seeming to barely restrain himself from hitting her with it.</t6397> <t6398>"What made you think I would like it?</t6398><t6399>"</t6399>
<t6400>"I don't know.</t6400> <t6401>But they told me... they told me you would like it.</t6401><t6402>"</t6402>
<t6403>“So they said that.</t6403> <t6404>Whoever said it must be a fool.</t6404> <t6405>I've never heard such a thing.</t6405> <t6406>Who are you talking about?</t6406><t6407>”</t6407>
<t6408>"Well... everyone."</t6408> <t6409>"They all said so, ma'am."</t6409><t6410>"</t6410>
<t6411>Aunt Sally was about to lose herself, her eyes were bulging, her fingers were spread as if she wanted to scratch him.</t6411>
<t6412>"'Everyone' you say, who are they?"</t6412> <t6413>"Quickly give their names; otherwise, this world will be short one more fool."</t6413><t6414>"</t6414>
<t6415>Tom stood up gloomily, speaking while playing with his hat:</t6415>
<t6416>“I'm sorry, I didn't expect it at all.</t6416> <t6417>They told me so.</t6417> <t6418>They all said so.</t6418> <t6419>They said if you kiss her, she will like it.</t6419> <t6420>They all said it…</t6420> <t6421>every single one of them.</t6421> <t6422>But I'm very sorry, ma'am, I won't do it again… I swear.</t6422><t6423>”</t6423>
<t6424>"Won't you do it, won't you do it?</t6424> <t6425>Just try and let's see!</t6425><t6426>"</t6426>
<t6427>“No; I swore, I will never do it again.</t6427> <t6428>Of course, unless you want me to.</t6428><t6429>”</t6429>
<t6430>"What if I don't want to?</t6430> <t6431>I've never seen such rudeness in my life!</t6431> <t6432>If you think I'll ask again, you must be the most foolish child ever...</t6432> <t6433>especially from someone like you!</t6433><t6434>"</t6434>
<t6435>“I am really surprised,” said Tom.</t6435> <t6436>“Honestly, I just can't understand it.</t6436> <t6437>They said you would like it; I thought you would like it too.</t6437> <t6438>But…” He paused and slowly looked around, as if searching for a friendly face; then he asked the old gentleman: “Didn't you think she would like me kissing her, sir?</t6438><t6439>”</t6439>
<t6440>“No way, I…</t6440> <t6441>don't think so at all.</t6441><t6442>”</t6442>
<t6443>He looked around again with the same expression, this time he asked me:</t6443>
<t6444>“Tom, didn't you think Aunt Sally would open her arms and say 'Sid Sawyer'?”</t6444><t6445>”</t6445>
<t6446>Aunt Sally exclaimed, "Oh my God!" and rushed towards him, "you little impudent rascal, how dare you deceive me like this?" She wanted to hug him but Tom pulled back.</t6446>
<t6447>"It won't happen, not unless you want it."</t6447><t6448>"</t6448>
<t6449>Aunt Sally wanted to kiss him without further delay; then she hugged him, kissed him repeatedly, then gave him to the old man and took the rest herself.</t6449> <t6450>After calming down a bit, she said:</t6450>
<t6451>“Oh my God, what a wonderful surprise this is.</t6451> <t6452>We were only expecting Tom, we had no idea you were coming.</t6452> <t6453>My sister never mentioned anyone else coming.</t6453><t6454>”</t6454>
<t6455>“Because indeed, it was not planned for someone else to come along with Tom,” said our Tom, “but I begged him until he was fed up and at the last minute he allowed me to come too; then while coming down the river with Tom, we thought it would be a great surprise if he came first and then I came and acted like a stranger.</t6455> <t6456>But we made a mistake, Aunt Sally.</t6456> <t6457>This is not a place where a stranger can come with peace of mind.</t6457><t6458>”</t6458>
<t6459>“No… I have no intention of making those insolent brats comfortable, Mr. Sid.</t6459> <t6460>You will learn to sit with decorum, I haven't been this angry in a long time.</t6460> <t6461>But it doesn't matter, I don't care how you came here…</t6461> <t6462>I can endure thousands of jokes without a word just to see you here.</t6462> <t6463>How much of an actor you are!</t6463> <t6464>I can't deny that when you kissed me, I was so shocked that my heart nearly stopped.</t6464><t6465>”</t6465>
<t6466>We ate our meal in the wide open passage between the house and the kitchen; there was enough food on the table to feed seven families – and it was all hot; it wasn't the kind of food that had sat all night in a damp cellar cupboard and wilted, looking like cannibal leftovers in the morning.</t6466> <t6467>Uncle Silas said a rather long prayer before the meal, but it was worth it; and the food didn't get cold at all, otherwise, I had witnessed many times before how the food got cold because of prayers.</t6467> <t6468>In the afternoon, there was hardly any silence; even though Tom and I listened intently, it was of no use, they didn't say anything about a runaway black man, and we were afraid to bring up the subject.</t6468> <t6469>But in the evening, at dinner, one of the little children asked:</t6469>
<t6470>"Dad, can Tom, Sid, and I go to the show?"</t6470><t6471></t6471>
<t6472>“No,” said the old man, “and besides, there won't be any show; even if there was, you couldn't go; because the runaway black man told me and Burton everything about that disgraceful show, and Burton went to tell the townspeople; by now, they must have driven those shameless rascals out of town.</t6472><t6473>”</t6473>
<t6474>Here was Jim mentioned!</t6474> <t6475>But there was nothing to be done at that moment.</t6475> <t6476>Tom and I were going to sleep in the same room and in the same bed; right after dinner, we said goodnight to everyone, claiming we were very tired, and went to our room, immediately climbed out of the window, slid down the lightning rod, and headed quickly to the town; because I thought no one had informed the king and the duke, so if we didn't hurry and tell them what had happened, they would get into big trouble.</t6476>
<t6477>Tom told me how I was thought to have been murdered, how my father disappeared shortly after and never returned, and the commotion that ensued when Jim escaped; I, in turn, told Tom everything about the Royal Nonesuch con men and our raft journey as much as time allowed; when we reached the town and got to the middle of it, we saw an angry mob coming; they had torches, and they were coming with terrifying shouts and screams, some banging pans, others blowing horns; we immediately threw ourselves aside to let them pass; as the crowd passed by, I saw that the king and the duke were each mounted on a pole – or rather, I realized they were the king and the duke, but they were covered in tar and feathers, they no longer resembled any human beings in this world – they looked more like a pair of gigantic soldier pincushions.</t6477> <t6478>I was devastated when I saw them.</t6478> <t6479>I felt sorry for these pitiful wretched scoundrels, and I felt that I could never be hard-hearted towards them again.</t6479> <t6480>Their condition was truly hair-raising.</t6480> <t6481>How cruel people can be to one another.</t6481>
<t6482>We realized that we were very late – there was nothing we could do.</t6482> <t6483>We asked passersby what had happened; according to what they said, everyone had gone to the show in seemingly innocent poses, and the poor old king hadn’t shown any sign until the middle of his antics on stage; then, when someone gave a signal, all the spectators rose up and pounced on them.</t6483>
<t6484>We returned home, and now I felt neither cheerful like at the beginning, but base, vile, and guilty – even though I had done nothing.</t6484> <t6485>But isn't it always like this; whether you do right or wrong changes nothing, the conscience has no logic, it aches incessantly in any case.</t6485> <t6486>If I had a dog as foolish as my conscience, I would poison it immediately.</t6486> <t6487>This wretched thing takes up more space inside a person than anything else and serves no purpose.</t6487> <t6488>Tom Sawyer thought the same thing.</t6488>
<t6489>Chapter Thirty-Four</t6489>
<t6490>We stopped talking and started thinking.</t6490> <t6491>Shortly after, Tom said:</t6491>
<t6492>“Huck, why didn't we think of this before?</t6492> <t6493>We were so stupid.</t6493> <t6494>I know exactly where Jim is.</t6494><t6495>”</t6495>
<t6496>“No way! Where is it?</t6496><t6497>”</t6497>
<t6498>"In the cabin near the ash silo.</t6498> <t6499>Remember, didn't you see a black man going there with a tray while we were having dinner?</t6499><t6500>"</t6500>
<t6501>"I saw it, didn't I."</t6501><t6502>"</t6502>
<t6503>“Where was that tray going?”</t6503><t6504>”</t6504>
<t6505>“Probably to a dog.</t6505><t6506>”</t6506>
<t6507>“I thought so too.</t6507> <t6508>But it wasn't going to the dog.</t6508><t6509>”</t6509>
<t6510>“Why?</t6510><t6511>”</t6511>
<t6512>“Because there was also a watermelon on it.</t6512><t6513>”</t6513>
<t6514>“Of course... I had seen it too.</t6514> <t6515>This is what you call intelligence, it never occurred to me that dogs don't eat watermelon.</t6515> <t6516>Is there a better proof of human obliviousness than this?</t6516><t6517>”</t6517>
<t6518>“The black man unlocked the padlock and went inside, and when he came out, he put the lock back in place.</t6518> <t6519>When we got up from the table, he brought my uncle a key...</t6519> <t6520>that was the key, I'm sure of it.</t6520> <t6521>The watermelon shows there was a person there, and the lock shows they were imprisoned; in such a small plantation, there probably aren't two prisoners, since everyone here gets along just fine.</t6521> <t6522>The prisoner is none other than our Jim.</t6522> <t6523>Alright...</t6523> <t6524>I'm glad we figured this out like detectives, otherwise, it wouldn't be any fun.</t6524> <t6525>Now use your brain and come up with a plan to rescue Jim, and I'll come up with one too, and we'll use whichever one we like better.</t6525><t6526>”</t6526>
<t6527>Such a mind in such a little boy!</t6527> <t6528>If I had a mind like Tom Sawyer's, I wouldn't give it up even if they made me a duke, or even if they made me a steamboat captain, a circus clown, or anything else that came to mind.</t6528> <t6529>I started making a plan, but I was doing it just for the sake of doing something; I knew very well whose mind the right plan would come from.</t6529> <t6530>Soon enough, Tom turned to me:</t6530>
<t6531>“Are you ready?</t6531><t6532>”</t6532>
<t6533>"Yes," I said.</t6533>
<t6534>“Alright… let's hear it.</t6534><t6535>”</t6535>
<t6536>“Here is my plan,” I said.</t6536> <t6537>“We can easily find out if Jim is there or not.</t6537> <t6538>Tomorrow night, I'll go get my canoe, go to the island, and bring the raft.</t6538> <t6539>On the first moonless night, I'll wait for the old man to fall asleep, then I'll steal the key from his pocket, and Jim and I will go down the river on the raft, hiding during the day and traveling at night, just like Jim and I used to do before.</t6539> <t6540>Do you think this plan will work?</t6540><t6541>”</t6541>
<t6542>“To be useful?</t6542> <t6543>Absolutely, it would be as easy as pulling a hair out of butter.</t6543> <t6544>But it's too simple, there's no difficulty at all.</t6544> <t6545>What good is a plan that doesn't create more challenges?</t6545> <t6546>It's as calm as goose milk.</t6546> <t6547>This plan is no harder than sneaking into a soap factory, Huck.</t6547><t6548>”</t6548>
<t6549>I didn't say anything, because I wasn't expecting any other attitude from him.</t6549> <t6550>But I knew very well that when he prepared his own plan, there would be nothing to object to.</t6550>
<t6551>It was truly a flawless plan.</t6551> <t6552>As soon as he explained it to me, I realized it was fifteen times better than my own plan, plus it adhered to the code and in the end, Jim would be at least as free as I was, and there was also the possibility that all of us might die.</t6552> <t6553>I found the plan very satisfying and immediately suggested we implement it.</t6553> <t6554>I don't feel the need to explain the plan here because I was sure things wouldn't go according to plan.</t6554> <t6555>I knew that once we took action, he would change the plan in any direction and come up with new inventions at every opportunity.</t6555> <t6556>And that's exactly what he did.</t6556>
<t6557>The only thing that was certain was that Tom Sawyer was serious and would indeed help me steal that black man.</t6557> <t6558>Frankly, in my opinion, this boy had crossed the line.</t6558> <t6559>Here was a well-bred, respectable boy standing before me; he was definitely a person of character; the other people in his house were also people of character; he was sharp-witted, not a fool; knowledgeable, not ignorant at all; not mean, but kind-hearted; yet he didn't hesitate to get involved in such a terrible deed, as if he didn't care about his honor, reputation, or name, and was willing to embarrass both himself and his family in front of everyone.</t6559> <t6560>I absolutely couldn't comprehend what he was doing.</t6560> <t6561>He had embarked on an ugly task, and I needed to tell him that; I had to act like a true friend, make him turn back while there was still time, and save himself.</t6561> <t6562>I had just started to speak when he silenced me with a gesture and said:</t6562>
<t6563>“Do you think I am someone who doesn't know what they're doing?</t6563> <t6564>Don't I usually act knowing what I'm doing?</t6564><t6565>”</t6565>
<t6566>“Yes.</t6566><t6567>”</t6567>
<t6568>“Didn't I tell you I would help you save the black man?</t6568><t6569>”</t6569>
<t6570>“Yes.</t6570><t6571>”</t6571>
<t6572>“Alright then.</t6572><t6573>”</t6573>
<t6574>He didn't say anything else, and I didn't raise my voice anymore.</t6574> <t6575>There was no point in saying anything else, because if he set his mind on something, he would definitely do it.</t6575> <t6576>But I could never understand how he was so willing to do this job; so I left it to fate and didn't think about the matter again.</t6576> <t6577>If doing this was written in his destiny, there was nothing I could do.</t6577>
<t6578>When we arrived, it was dark and quiet; so we headed directly to the shack near the ash silo, we wanted to take a look.</t6578> <t6579>We went straight through the courtyard to see what the dogs would do.</t6579> <t6580>They knew us and made as much noise as shepherd dogs seeing people at night would make.</t6580> <t6581>When we reached the shack, we scouted the front and both sides; on the side I hadn't seen before – the north side – we saw a square window that could be considered quite high, with only one thick board nailed over it.</t6581>
<t6582>“Here is the exit ticket,” I said.</t6582> <t6583>“If we remove the board, this hole will become big enough for Jim to pass through.</t6583><t6584>”</t6584>
<t6585>“As easy as playing three stones,” said Tom.</t6585> <t6586>“As easy as skipping school.</t6586> <t6587>I hope we can find a way a bit more complicated than this, Huck Finn.</t6587><t6588>”</t6588>
<t6589>“Alright then,” I said, “How about cutting the wall with a saw to get him out?</t6589> <t6590>That's what I did before he was killed.</t6590><t6591>”</t6591>
<t6592>“This is better,” he said.</t6592> <t6593>“Truly mysterious, challenging, and good,” he said.</t6593> <t6594>“But I am sure we can find a way that will take at least twice as long.</t6594> <t6595>We are in no hurry, let's keep looking around.</t6595><t6596>”</t6596>
<t6597>Between the fence and the shed, at the back where the shed's roof eaves met, there was a storage made of planks.</t6597> <t6598>It was as long as the shed, but narrow...</t6598> <t6599>only two meters wide.</t6599> <t6600>The door was at the south end and had a padlock on it.</t6600> <t6601>After Tom went over to the soap cauldron and did some investigating, he returned with an iron rod used to lift the lid; with this rod, he pried out one of the nails.</t6601> <t6602>The chain fell to the ground and we opened the door and went inside.</t6602> <t6603>After closing the door behind us, we lit a match to see around.</t6603> <t6604>The storage was only built against the wall of the shed and there was no connection between them; the floor of the storage was dirt, and inside there were only a few rusty hoes, shovels, picks, and a broken plow.</t6604> <t6605>When the match went out, we went outside and put the nail back in place, the door was locked as before.</t6605> <t6606>Tom was cheerful.</t6606>
<t6607>“Alright, now it's done,” he said.</t6607> <t6608>“We will dig it out.</t6608> <t6609>It will take about a week!</t6609><t6610>”</t6610>
<t6611>We went out and headed home, I entered through the back door – you just need to pull a leather strap, they don't lock the doors – but for Tom Sawyer, this wasn't romantic enough: He insisted on climbing up the lightning rod.</t6611> <t6612>But after climbing halfway up three times and falling, and narrowly avoiding cracking his head open the last time, he started to think he might have to give up; but after resting for a while, he decided to give it one last try, hoping his luck would turn, and this time he succeeded.</t6612>
<t6613>We woke up at dawn and went to the negro cabins to both pet the dogs and befriend the negro who fed Jim –that is, if the negro being fed was Jim.</t6613> <t6614>The negroes had just had breakfast and were preparing to head out to the fields; the one who fed Jim was placing bread, meat, and other things on a tray; as the others left, the key also came from the house.</t6614>
<t6615>This black man was good-natured and had a cheerful face, he had tied his hair in thin strands with strings.</t6615> <t6616>He did this to keep witches away.</t6616> <t6617>He said that the witches had been bothering him a lot for a few nights, causing him to see strange things and hear strange words and noises; he couldn't remember the witches ever haunting him for this long before.</t6617> <t6618>He got really excited and started to list his troubles without stopping, completely forgetting the work he was doing.</t6618> <t6619>Tom reminded him:</t6619>
<t6620>“What are these foods for?</t6620> <t6621>Are you going to feed the dogs?</t6621><t6622>”</t6622>
<t6623>A smile slowly spread across the rich man's face, just like waves spreading when a brick is thrown into a swamp.</t6623>
<t6624>“Yes, Master Sid, I will feed the dog.</t6624> <t6625>And it's a strange dog.</t6625> <t6626>Would you like to come and see it?</t6626><t6627>”</t6627>
<t6628>“Yes.</t6628><t6629>”</t6629>
<t6630>I nudged Tom with an elbow and whispered:</t6630>
<t6631>“Are you going to enter the cabin directly at sunrise?</t6631> <t6632>That wasn't our plan.</t6632><t6633>”</t6633>
<t6634>“It wasn't...</t6634> <t6635>but now the plan is this.</t6635><t6636>”</t6636>
<t6637>Damn it, we followed the black man, but I didn't really like it.</t6637> <t6638>When we entered, we couldn't see anything at first, it was very dark; but Jim was definitely there and could see us, he called out excitedly:</t6638>
<t6639>"Hey, Huck! My dear friend!</t6639> <t6640>And isn't that Mr. Tom next to you?</t6640><t6641>"</t6641>
<t6642>I knew very well what was going to happen, it was exactly as I expected.</t6642> <t6643>I was at a loss for what to do, even if I wasn't, there was nothing I could do, because the black man intervened:</t6643>
<t6644>"By the morning light! Does this black man know you or what?"</t6644><t6645></t6645>
<t6646>We could now see the inside quite well.</t6646> <t6647>Tom turned his head to the black man and looked at him curiously:</t6647>
<t6648>“Does anyone know us?</t6648><t6649>”</t6649>
<t6650>"There's the runaway black man."</t6650><t6651>"</t6651>
<t6652>“I don't think you know him at all, but why do you ask?</t6652><t6653>”</t6653>
<t6654>“Why would I leave?</t6654> <t6655>Didn't he just call out to you as if he knew you?</t6655><t6656>”</t6656>
<t6657>Tom replied, pretending to be surprised:</t6657>
<t6658>“This is strange.”</t6658> <t6659>“Who called out?”</t6659> <t6660>“When did they call out?”</t6660> <t6661>“What did they say?”</t6661> <t6662>He turned to me very calmly: “Did you hear anyone call out?”</t6662><t6663>”</t6663>
<t6664>Of course, there was only one answer that could be given to this question.</t6664>
<t6665>"No; I didn't hear anyone say anything."</t6665><t6666></t6666>
<t6667>Then he turned to Jim and, looking at him as if he were someone he had never seen before in his life, asked:</t6667>
<t6668>"Did you call out to us?"</t6668><t6669>"</t6669>
<t6670>"No, sir," said Jim, "not a single word came out of my mouth, sir.</t6670><t6671>"</t6671>
<t6672>“Not a single word came out?</t6672><t6673>”</t6673>
<t6674>"No, master, not a single word came out.</t6674><t6675>"</t6675>
<t6676>“Have you seen us before?</t6676><t6677>”</t6677>
<t6678>"No, sir, I don't remember ever seeing you before."</t6678><t6679></t6679>
<t6680>Thereupon, Tom turned to the black man, who was in a state of shock and worry, and asked very seriously:</t6680>
<t6681>“What’s wrong with you?</t6681> <t6682>Where did you get the idea that someone was calling out?</t6682><t6683>”</t6683>
<t6684>“Ah, that accursed witch, master, I wish God would take my life so I could be free.</t6684> <t6685>She always does this, she kills me, she scares me a lot.</t6685> <t6686>Whatever happens, don't tell anyone about this, master, or Master Silas will be angry with me, because he says there's no such thing as a witch.</t6686> <t6687>My God, I wish he were here too...</t6687> <t6688>then what would happen?</t6688> <t6689>Surely this time he couldn't deny their existence.</t6689> <t6690>But it always happens like this, those who don't want to believe won't believe; they make excuses and don't learn the truth; and when you tell them, they never believe it.</t6690><t6691>”</t6691>
<t6692>Tom gave her ten cents and told her that we wouldn't tell anyone anything; after advising her to get some more string to tie her hair, he looked at Jim and said:</t6692>
<t6693>“Uncle Silas, do you think he will hang this black man?”</t6693> <t6694>“If I caught a black man who was unfaithful enough to run away, I would never forgive him, I would hang him right then and there.”</t6694> <t6695>While the black man stepped outside into the light to look at the ten cents and bit the coin to see if it was real, Tom leaned over and whispered to Jim:</t6695>
<t6696>"Don't let anyone know that you recognize us.</t6696> <t6697>If you hear digging sounds at night, it's us: We will rescue you.</t6697><t6698>"</t6698>
<t6699>Jim only had time to grab and squeeze our hands, the other black man came back and we told him that we could come again if he wanted; he especially wanted us to come when it was dark, because witches mostly came at night and it would be good to have someone with him.</t6699>
<t6700>Chapter Thirty-Five</t6700>
<t6701>There was still about an hour until breakfast, so we left and went into the forest; because Tom had said that we would need some light to see ahead while digging, but a lantern would be too much and could get us into trouble; we needed to find some rotten wood called foxfire.</t6701> <t6702>When you put this wood in a dark place, it emitted a faint light.</t6702> <t6703>We gathered an armful of foxfire and hid it among the grass, then sat down to rest a bit.</t6703> <t6704>Tom, still unsatisfied, said:</t6704>
<t6705>“Damn it, this job is way too easy and it breaks the code.</t6705> <t6706>That's why it makes it difficult to come up with a hard plan, damn it.</t6706> <t6707>There's no guard to give a sleeping pill to...</t6707> <t6708>Yet there should definitely be a guard.</t6708> <t6709>There's not even a dog we can give a sleep-inducing mixture to.</t6709> <t6710>Also, Jim is chained to the leg of his bed with a three-meter chain, all we have to do is lift the bed and remove the chain.</t6710> <t6711>Uncle Silas trusts everyone; he sends the key to that empty-headed black man and doesn't send anyone to watch over him.</t6711> <t6712>If Jim wanted, he could have already gotten out of that window hole, though he couldn't go anywhere with a three-meter chain on his foot.</t6712> <t6713>I'm getting discouraged, Huck, I've never heard of such a stupid setup before.</t6713> <t6714>We'll have to invent all the difficulties ourselves.</t6714> <t6715>Anyway, there's nothing else to do, it's best to make do with the materials we have and get this job done as best as we can.</t6715> <t6716>The honor of rescuing Jim by facing a lot of difficulties and dangers is great.</t6716> <t6717>Moreover, if the people who were supposed to create these difficulties were lazy and you had to create all the difficulties and dangers yourself, you add to your honor.</t6717> <t6718>Let's consider the simplest thing, like this lantern.</t6718> <t6719>Looking at the solid facts, we have to pretend there's a danger in using the lantern.</t6719> <t6720>Yet if we wanted, we could work with a whole parade of lanterns, no one would notice.</t6720> <t6721>By the way, we need to make a saw without wasting any time, we need to find suitable materials.</t6721>
<t6722>“What are we going to do with the saw?</t6722><t6723>”</t6723>
<t6724>“What are we going to do?</t6724> <t6725>Don't we need to cut the leg of Jim's bed to remove the chain?</t6725><t6726>”</t6726>
<t6727>“Why?</t6727> <t6728>You just said that lifting the bed and removing the chain would be enough.</t6728><t6729>”</t6729>
<t6730>“This is just the kind of thing for you, Huck Finn.</t6730> <t6731>In some matters, you're such a wimp, man!</t6731> <t6732>Have you never read a book before?</t6732> <t6733>Have you never heard of Baron Trenck, Casanova, Benvenuto Cellini, IV.</t6733> <t6734>Henry, or the other heroes, for God's sake?</t6734> <t6735>Where have you ever seen a prisoner being freed using methods fit for old ladies?</t6735> <t6736>No, the greatest experts in this field cut the leg of the bed, but leave it in place and swallow the sawdust so it can't be found; they smear mud and grease on the cut so that even the most vigilant guards won't realize it's been cut, thinking the bed leg is completely intact.</t6736> <t6737>But on the night you're ready, you give the bed leg a kick, it splits in two; you remove your chain, and that's it.</t6737> <t6738>Then all you have to do is tie the rope ladder to the barred windows, climb down, and fall into the ditch and break your leg – because the rope ladder is five or six meters too short – and right in front of you, you'll find your horses and loyal servants, who will grab you, put you on a saddle, and you'll head off to your homeland, Languedoc, Navarre, or wherever it is.</t6738> <t6739>How grand it would be, Huck, if only this cabin had a ditch too.</t6739> <t6740>If we find the time, let's dig one on the night of the escape.</t6740><t6741>”</t6741>
<t6742>"Well, but if we're going to get him out from under the shed, what use is the trench?" I asked.</t6742>
<t6743>But she didn't even hear me.</t6743> <t6744>She had forgotten me and everything else.</t6744> <t6745>She was thinking with her chin resting in her palm.</t6745> <t6746>After a while, she sighed, shook her head from side to side, and then sighed again, saying:</t6746>
<t6747>“No, no, that won't do... it's not necessary enough.</t6747><t6748>”</t6748>
<t6749>"What is it?" I said.</t6749>
<t6750>“Cutting off Jim's leg, of course,” he said.</t6750>
<t6751>“My God!” I said, “It is definitely not necessary at all.</t6751> <t6752>Why do you even want to cut off his leg?</t6752><t6753>”</t6753>
<t6754>“Some of the greatest masters did it that way.</t6754> <t6755>They couldn't remove the chain, so they cut off their hands and escaped.</t6755> <t6756>Cutting off a leg would be even better.</t6756> <t6757>But let's skip that for now.</t6757> <t6758>In Jim's case, it's not really necessary, plus Jim is a black man and won't understand why it's customary in Europe; so let's not do it this time.</t6758> <t6759>But there's something else...</t6759> <t6760>A rope ladder could work; we can tear up our sheets and easily make a rope ladder for him.</t6760> <t6761>We can send this ladder to him inside a pie, that's usually how it's done.</t6761> <t6762>I've eaten the worst pies just...</t6762><t6763>”</t6763>
<t6764>“What nonsense are you talking about, Tom Sawyer?” I said.</t6764> <t6765>“What is Jim going to do with a rope ladder?</t6765><t6766>”</t6766>
<t6767>“It is essential to use it.</t6767> <t6768>What nonsense are you talking about, you should have said from the beginning that you don't understand these things at all.</t6768> <t6769>A rope ladder is indispensable, all the masters use a rope ladder.</t6769><t6770>”</t6770>
<t6771>“Okay, but what will he do with the rope ladder?</t6771><t6772>”</t6772>
<t6773>“What will he do?</t6773> <t6774>He can hide it inside his bed, can't he?</t6774> <t6775>They all do that; he has to do it too.</t6775> <t6776>Huck, it seems like you don't want to do anything according to the rules, you are intent on discovering everything from scratch.</t6776> <t6777>Let's say he didn't use it for anything…</t6777> <t6778>Won't it remain as a clue inside the bed after he leaves?</t6778> <t6779>Don't you ever consider that they will want a clue?</t6779> <t6780>Of course they will want it.</t6780> <t6781>And won't you leave them any clue?</t6781> <t6782>Does this fit the code at all?</t6782> <t6783>I've never heard of such a thing in my life, honestly.</t6783><t6784>”</t6784>
<t6785>“Since the rule is like this and it has to be a rope ladder, fine, let it be; I really don't want to go against any rule; but there's something else, Tom Sawyer...</t6785> <t6786>If we tear our sheets to make a rope ladder for Jim, we'll get into big trouble with Aunt Sally, I know this for sure.</t6786> <t6787>If you ask me, a ladder made of walnut tree bark is both cost-free and doesn't require wasting anything else, plus it can be put inside a pie or among the straw of the mattress just like rope ladders; besides, Jim has no experience in these matters anyway, so I doubt he'll care what kind of ladder we use...</t6787><t6788>”</t6788>
<t6789>“Gene saçmaladın, Huck Finn, cahil cahil konuşup duruyorsun iki saattir…</t6789> <t6790>Hiçbir şey bilmiyorsan bari çeneni tutmayı bileydin.</t6790> <t6791>Bir mahkûmun ağaç kabuğundan merdivenle kaçtığı da nerede duyulmuş?</t6791> <t6792>Böyle gülünç şey olur mu hiç?</t6792><t6793>”</t6793>
<t6794>“Alright, Tom, let it be as you wish; but listen to me and please allow me to borrow from the hanging laundry.</t6794><t6795>”</t6795>
<t6796>He did not object to this.</t6796> <t6797>In fact, another idea came to his mind:</t6797>
<t6798>“Also, borrow a shirt.</t6798><t6799>”</t6799>
<t6800>“Well, what are we going to do with the shirt, Tom?</t6800><t6801>”</t6801>
<t6802>“For Jim to keep a diary.</t6802><t6803>”</t6803>
<t6804>"Come on now...</t6804> <t6805>Jim can't read or write.</t6805><t6806>"</t6806>
<t6807>“Let's say he can't write...</t6807> <t6808>can't he draw pictures and signs on the shirt either?</t6808> <t6809>We can make him a pen from an iron spoon or a piece of barrel hoop.</t6809><t6810>”</t6810>
<t6811>"Well, but we can pluck a goose's feather and make a much better pen, Tom, and it would be quicker."</t6811><t6812>"</t6812>
<t6813>“Prisoners in jail don't have geese to pluck feathers from to make pens, you fool.</t6813> <t6814>They always make their pens from old brass candlesticks or other hard, rigid, and difficult-to-bend objects they have at hand; making a pen can take weeks, even months, because they have no choice but to rub what they have against the wall to turn it into a pen.</t6814> <t6815>Even if they could find goose feathers, they wouldn't use them.</t6815> <t6816>It doesn't follow the rules.</t6816><t6817>”</t6817>
<t6818>“Well then, how are we going to make the ink?</t6818><t6819>”</t6819>
<t6820>“Most prisoners mix rust with their tears; but this is typical of the lower class and women; the experts use their own blood.</t6820> <t6821>If Jim can do this and wants to send a simple mysterious message to let the world know where he is being held, he can scratch it onto the back of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out the window.</t6821> <t6822>The Man in the Iron Mask always does it that way, and in my opinion, it’s a remarkably good method.</t6822><t6823>”</t6823>
<t6824>“Jim doesn't have a tin plate.</t6824> <t6825>They serve him food on a tray.</t6825><t6826>”</t6826>
<t6827>“It doesn't matter, we'll take him a plate.</t6827><t6828>”</t6828>
<t6829>"No one can read what is written on his plate"</t6829>
<t6830>“This has nothing to do with our topic, Huck Finn.</t6830> <t6831>All he has to do is write on the plate and throw it out.</t6831> <t6832>We don't need to be able to read it.</t6832> <t6833>Half of what a prisoner writes on a tin plate or elsewhere is unreadable anyway.</t6833><t6834>”</t6834>
<t6835>“So why are we wasting the plates then?</t6835><t6836>”</t6836>
<t6837>“What difference does it make, they are not the prisoner's plates.</t6837><t6838>”</t6838>
<t6839>“But it's someone's plate, isn't it?</t6839><t6840>”</t6840>
<t6841>“Let's say it is so, so what?</t6841> <t6842>Why would the prisoner care about who the plate belongs to…</t6842><t6843>”</t6843>
<t6844>He fell silent here, because we had heard the breakfast bell ring.</t6844> <t6845>Thus, we headed home.</t6845>
<t6846>That morning, I borrowed a sheet and a shirt from the hanging laundry; I found an old sack and put both inside, then we went to find the foxfire and put it in the sack as well.</t6846> <t6847>I said borrowed because my father always said so; but Tom said it wasn't borrowing, it was stealing.</t6847> <t6848>According to him, we were representing prisoners; prisoners didn't care how they got something and no one blamed them for it.</t6848> <t6849>Tom said it wasn't a crime for a prisoner to steal what he needed to escape; it was his right, so as long as we were representing a prisoner, we had every right to steal even the least of what we needed to free ourselves from prison.</t6849> <t6850>If we weren't prisoners, everything would be different, if someone who wasn't a prisoner stole, he could only be a common person.</t6850> <t6851>So, we said we could steal anything that came our way.</t6851> <t6852>Yet, when I stole and ate a watermelon from the negroes' garden in the following days, he got very angry with me.</t6852> <t6853>"Go give the negroes ten cents and don't tell them why," he said.</t6853> <t6854>This time, Tom said we could only steal what we needed.</t6854> <t6855>"But I needed that watermelon," I said.</t6855> <t6856>But he said I didn't need the watermelon to escape from prison, that was the difference.</t6856> <t6857>If I sent the watermelon with a knife inside to Jim to kill the head guard, there was no problem.</t6857> <t6858>So I gave in, but if I had to sit and split hairs like this every time I got a chance to swipe a watermelon, there was no advantage to representing a prisoner at all.</t6858>
<t6859>Anyway, as I said, we waited until everyone started to get busy with their own work that morning, and by then no one was visible in the courtyard anymore; while Tom was carrying the sack to the storeroom, I kept watch from a bit of a distance.</t6859> <t6860>After a while, he came out again, and we went and sat on a pile of wood and started talking.</t6860>
<t6861>“Everything is ready now,” said Tom, “but only the tools are left; we can easily take care of that.</t6861><t6862>”</t6862>
<t6863>“The tools?</t6863><t6864>”</t6864>
<t6865>“Yes.</t6865><t6866>”</t6866>
<t6867>“What are the tools for?</t6867><t6868>”</t6868>
<t6869>“Of course, to dig.</t6869> <t6870>We won't be gnawing at the soil to get it out, I suppose.</t6870><t6871>”</t6871>
<t6872>"Won't the old pickaxes inside be enough to get a black man out?"</t6872><t6873>"</t6873>
<t6874>He turned and looked at me with such pity that I could have cried at that moment.</t6874>
<t6875>“Huck Finn, have you ever heard of a prisoner with a pickaxe and a shovel, a prisoner who fills his locker with all modern tools to dig his way out?</t6875> <t6876>If you have even a little bit of sense in your head, I ask you, how will he become a hero if he escapes this way?</t6876> <t6877>We might as well just hand him the key.</t6877> <t6878>A pickaxe and a shovel… they wouldn't even give such tools to kings.</t6878><t6879>”</t6879>
<t6880>“Alright, let's say we don't want pickaxes and shovels, then what do we want?</t6880><t6881>”</t6881>
<t6882>"Two pocketknives."</t6882><t6883>"</t6883>
<t6884>"To pierce through the foundations of the cabin?</t6884><t6885>"</t6885>
<t6886>“Yes.</t6886><t6887>”</t6887>
<t6888>"Oops! But this is very silly, Tom."</t6888><t6889></t6889>
<t6890>“Whether it is foolish or not, this is the truth…</t6890> <t6891>the one that complies with the rules.</t6891> <t6892>So far, I haven't heard of any other way, despite reading all the books that provide all kinds of information on such matters.</t6892> <t6893>They always dig with a knife…</t6893> <t6894>not the soil; they usually drill the rock with a knife.</t6894> <t6895>They work for weeks, it almost takes forever.</t6895> <t6896>One of the prisoners lying in the dungeon at the bottom of Deef Castle in the port of Marseille escaped by drilling the rock with a knife; guess how long it took?</t6896><t6897>”</t6897>
<t6898>"I don't know.</t6898><t6899>"</t6899>
<t6900>"Then guess."</t6900><t6901>"</t6901>
<t6902>"How should I know.</t6902> <t6903>A month and a half?</t6903><t6904>"</t6904>
<t6905>"Thirty-seven years...</t6905> <t6906>it came all the way from China.</t6906> <t6907>This is the rule of this matter.</t6907> <t6908>I wish the base of this castle was also rock.</t6908><t6909>"</t6909>
<t6910>"Jim doesn't know anyone in China."</t6910><t6911></t6911>
<t6912>“But what does this have to do with anything?</t6912> <t6913>That man didn't know anyone either.</t6913> <t6914>But you always get hung up on trivial things.</t6914> <t6915>Why do you stray away from the main issue?</t6915><t6916>”</t6916>
<t6917>“Alright, well… it doesn't matter where it came from, it has emerged in the end; it probably doesn't matter for Jim either.</t6917> <t6918>However, there is one problem…</t6918> <t6919>Jim is too old to be removed with a knife.</t6919> <t6920>He doesn't have enough time left.</t6920><t6921>”</t6921>
<t6922>“Don't worry, he has enough life left.</t6922> <t6923>You don't really think it will take thirty-seven years to dig the soil, do you?</t6923><t6924>”</t6924>
<t6925>“Well, how long will it take, Tom?</t6925><t6926>”</t6926>
<t6927>“Of course, we can't expect it to last as long as it normally would, because it won't take long for Uncle Silas to get news from New Orleans.</t6927> <t6928>He will find out that Jim is not from there.</t6928> <t6929>Then maybe he will put ads in the newspapers for Jim or do something similar.</t6929> <t6930>We can't risk getting him out in the necessary time.</t6930> <t6931>If you ask me, it would probably take a few years, but we can't wait that long.</t6931> <t6932>Since things are so uncertain, I suggest this: Let's dig as fast as we can, and then we can pretend we've reached the end of thirty-seven years whenever we want.</t6932> <t6933>That is, as soon as we sense things are changing, let's get him out and escape immediately.</t6933> <t6934>Yes, I think this is the best.</t6934><t6935>”</t6935>
<t6936>“Now you've said something wise,” I said.</t6936> <t6937>“There's no harm in pretending we've reached the end, and we won't get into trouble; if we have a purpose, I don't even mind pretending to dig for a hundred and fifty years.</t6937> <t6938>Once the job is done, it won't be a problem for me.</t6938> <t6939>The best thing now is for me to go and find two knives.</t6939><t6940>”</t6940>
<t6941>“Find three,” he said, “we will make a saw from one of them.</t6941><t6942>”</t6942>
<t6943>“Tom, if it is not against the rules and ungodly, I will suggest something,” I said.</t6943> <t6944>“I had seen the tip of a rusty saw under the cover of the trench behind the smokehouse.</t6944><t6945>”</t6945>
<t6946>Tom said in a weary and disheartened tone:</t6946>
<t6947>“There’s no use in trying to teach you anything, Huck.</t6947> <t6948>Quickly go and bring three knives…</t6948> <t6949>three of them.</t6949><t6950>”</t6950>
<t6951>I did as he said.</t6951>
<t6952>Chapter Thirty-Six</t6952>
<t6953>That night, at a moment when we thought everyone was asleep, we slid down the lightning rod, entered the shed, closed the door behind us, took out our foxfire pile, and started working.</t6953> <t6954>We cleared everything around to open up a one to one and a half centimeter space in the middle of the log at the bottom.</t6954> <t6955>Tom said we were exactly behind Jim's bed, we were going to dig right under his bed, and when we got there, no one entering the cabin would realize there was a hole there, because the cover of Jim's bed almost reached the floor, and to understand there was a hole underneath, you would have to lift the cover.</t6955> <t6956>So we dug and dug with our knives until midnight; finally, we were as tired as dogs, our palms were blistered, but still, we had hardly done anything.</t6956> <t6957>Finally, I said:</t6957>
<t6958>"Tom Sawyer, this job will last not thirty-seven years, but even thirty-eight years."</t6958><t6959></t6959>
<t6960>He didn't make a sound.</t6960> <t6961>But he sighed deeply and a little later he put down the pickaxe; in the ensuing silence, I could feel that he was thinking.</t6961>
<t6962>“It's no use, Huck,” he said.</t6962> <t6963>“It won't work.</t6963> <t6964>If we were prisoners, it would work, because then we would have as many years as we wanted, we wouldn't be in a hurry; moreover, we could dig for just a few minutes a day, when the guards change shifts, so our hands wouldn't blister; since we would continue for years, we would follow the rules and do this job the right way.</t6964> <t6965>But we don't have time to waste, we must hurry; this job must be finished soon.</t6965> <t6966>If we work like this for one more night, we will have to wait a week for our hands to heal...</t6966> <t6967>Soon we won't be able to hold the knife.</t6967><t6968>”</t6968>
<t6969>“Well, what are we going to do then, Tom?</t6969><t6970>”</t6970>
<t6971>“I will tell you.</t6971> <t6972>Actually, it is neither right nor moral...</t6972> <t6973>I didn't want such words to come out of my mouth; but there is only one way left; we will dig with a pickaxe and pretend we dug with a knife.</t6973><t6974>”</t6974>
<t6975>“Now it's done!” I said, “Your brain works better every time, Tom Sawyer.</t6975> <t6976>Whether it's moral or immoral, the best way is to dig; and if you ask me, I don't care about morality at all.</t6976> <t6977>Once you start stealing a black person, a watermelon, or a hymn book, I don't think it matters how you do it.</t6977> <t6978>I want my black person, I want my watermelon, or I want my hymn book; if the easiest way to get it is by digging, then I'll dig out the black person, the watermelon, or the hymn book; I don't give a damn about what the experts say on this matter.</t6978><t6979>”</t6979>
<t6980>“There is a valid reason for using picks and considering them as knives here,” he said.</t6980> <t6981>“If it weren't so, I would never approve, and I can't just stand by while rules are being violated...</t6981> <t6982>Because right is right; wrong is wrong, and if a person is not ignorant, if they know they shouldn't do it, they won't do wrong.</t6982> <t6983>Getting Jim out using a pick without any pretense might be a solution for you, that's how much you know about these things, but it's not a solution for me, because I know it's wrong.</t6983> <t6984>Give me a knife.</t6984><t6985>”</t6985>
<t6986>He had his own knife in his hand, and I gave him my own knife.</t6986> <t6987>He threw the knife to the ground and repeated:</t6987>
<t6988>“I am asking you to give me a pocketknife.</t6988><t6989>”</t6989>
<t6990>At first, I didn't know what to do...</t6990> <t6991>But then I thought.</t6991> <t6992>I reached for the old tools, took an old pickaxe and gave it to him, he took the pickaxe and started working without saying a single word.</t6992>
<t6993>That's how meticulous he was.</t6993> <t6994>He was a man of principles.</t6994>
<t6995>Upon this, I also took a shovel, and then we dug the soil using the pickaxe and the shovel in turns.</t6995> <t6996>We worked for another half hour, then we couldn't stand the sleeplessness anymore; but by then, we had already opened a fairly large hole.</t6996> <t6997>I went upstairs, and when I looked out the window, I saw Tom desperately trying to climb the lightning rod, but he couldn't manage it because his palms were blistered.</t6997>
<t6998>“It's no use, it's impossible to do this,” he said finally.</t6998> <t6999>“Do you think I have any other choice?</t6999> <t7000>Can you think of a way?</t7000><t7001>”</t7001>
<t7002>"He's coming," I said, "but it doesn't seem to follow the rules.</t7002> <t7003>Go up the stairs and pretend you came out of the lightning rod.</t7003><t7004>"</t7004>
<t7005>That's exactly what he did.</t7005>
<t7006>The next day, Tom stole a tin spoon and a brass candlestick from home; we were going to make a pen for Jim with these, and he also got six candles; I hung around the negro cabins and found an opportunity to steal three tin plates.</t7006> <t7007>Tom said these weren't enough; but I said no one would see the plates Jim threw, because they would fall among the dog daisies and hawthorns under the window – we could collect the plates and use them again.</t7007> <t7008>Tom was satisfied.</t7008>
<t7009>“Now we need to figure out how to get the necessary things to Jim,” he said.</t7009>
<t7010>"After completing the hole, we pass them through the hole," I said.</t7010>
<t7011>After sarcastically looking and saying that no one had ever heard such a foolish idea, he began to think.</t7011> <t7012>After a while, he said that he had found two or three ways, but for now, it was not necessary to decide on any of them.</t7012> <t7013>First, we should reach Jim.</t7013>
<t7014>That night, shortly after ten o'clock, we came down from the lightning rod and took one of the candles with us; when we stood under the window, we heard Jim snoring; we threw the candle inside, but he didn't wake up.</t7014> <t7015>After working with the pickaxe and shovel for about two hours, we had completed half the job.</t7015> <t7016>First, we went under Jim's bed, then into the cabin, felt around and found the candle, and lit it.</t7016> <t7017>We stood over Jim for a while; he looked quite lively and healthy; we woke him up slowly.</t7017> <t7018>He was so happy to see us that he almost cried; he called us "my dear" and said all the affectionate words he could think of; he asked us to find a chisel to cut the shackle on his leg, and then we would escape without wasting any time.</t7018> <t7019>But Tom told him how against the rules that was, sat down and explained our plan from start to finish, and said that we could change everything in a minute in case of an emergency; there was no need for him to be afraid because we would definitely ensure his escape.</t7019> <t7020>Jim said it was no problem, we sat together for a while and talked about the old days, then Tom asked many questions.</t7020> <t7021>Jim told him that Uncle Silas came almost every day to pray with him, and Aunt Sally also came to check if he was comfortable and had plenty of food; they both treated him very well.</t7021>
<t7022>“Now I have found a way to handle this,” said Tom.</t7022> <t7023>“We will send you some things with them.</t7023><t7024>”</t7024>
<t7025>“We could never do such a thing in life,” I said.</t7025> <t7026>“This is the most foolish idea I’ve ever heard.”</t7026> <t7027>But he didn’t even listen to me, he continued speaking.</t7027> <t7028>It was always like this when he made his plans.</t7028>
<t7029>He explained to Jim that we had to send the rope ladder and other big things through the black man Nat, who brought him food; Jim had to always be alert, not look surprised, and not cause Nat to open them; we would put some small things in uncle's coat pockets, and Jim would steal them from there; we would tie some things to aunt's apron strings or put some in her apron pocket if we got the chance; he also explained what these things were and what they would be used for.</t7029> <t7030>He also explained how to keep a diary with his blood on the shirt and other things.</t7030> <t7031>He listed everything one by one.</t7031> <t7032>Jim didn't understand the reason for most of it, but he said that we were white and would know better; he was satisfied and would do everything exactly as Tom said.</t7032>
<t7033>Jim had plenty of corncob pipes and tobacco; so the conversation lasted quite a while; then we crawled out of the hole, went home, and lay down in our beds, our hands looking like they had been chewed and spat on.</t7033> <t7034>Tom was so delighted, you can't imagine.</t7034> <t7035>He said this was the most fun and most contemplative event of his life; if he could find a way, we could spend the rest of our lives on this, and then leave it to our children to get Jim out, because he thought Jim would like it more as he got used to it.</t7035> <t7036>Maybe we could extend the rescue to eighty years and achieve the longest duration ever.</t7036> <t7037>Moreover, everyone involved in this would become famous.</t7037>
<t7038>In the morning, we went to the woodpile and cut the brass candlestick into suitable pieces, Tom put these and the iron spoon in his pocket.</t7038> <t7039>Then we went to the negro cabins, and when Nat was distracted, Tom slipped a piece of the candlestick into a piece of cornbread in Jim's pan, then we went to Nat to see if it would work, and indeed our plan worked very well; when Jim bit into the bread, he almost broke all his teeth; it was really hard to come up with a plan that would work better than this.</t7039> <t7040>Tom said this himself.</t7040> <t7041>Jim didn't show any reaction, he acted as if a piece of stone had come out of his bread as usual; but after that, he didn't bite into anything without poking it three or four times with his fork.</t7041>
<t7042>While we were standing there in the dim light, a pair of dogs came out from under Jim's bed, followed by other dogs, and eleven dogs entered, leaving no room to breathe.</t7042> <t7043>Oh no, we had forgotten to close the shed door.</t7043> <t7044>Black Nat collapsed among the dogs after shouting "Witches!" just once and began to moan as if he were dying.</t7044> <t7045>Tom immediately opened the door and threw out a slice of meat that had come to Jim; the dogs followed it out. Tom disappeared for two seconds but then came back and closed the door, and I realized he had closed the other door as well.</t7045> <t7046>Then the old black man started working on him, trying to cheer him up, pampering him, and asking if he had seen the same thing again.</t7046> <t7047>The man lifted his head, blinked his eyes as he looked around, and said:</t7047>
<t7048>“Master Sid, you call me a fool, but I almost saw a million dogs, or were they devils?</t7048> <t7049>Let me be a dog if I'm lying, may I not be blessed to go from one place to another.</t7049> <t7050>Master Sid, it seems to me...</t7050> <t7051>It seems to me that they all fell upon me.</t7051> <t7052>Oh, if I could catch one of them, if I could catch just one of those witches, I wouldn't want anything else... just for a moment... that's all I want.</t7052> <t7053>But most of all, I want them to leave me alone.</t7053><t7054>”</t7054>
<t7055>“Hmm, let me tell you what I think,” said Tom.</t7055> <t7056>“What could be bringing them here exactly at the breakfast time of this runaway negro?</t7056> <t7057>If you ask me, they are hungry, that's why they are coming.</t7057> <t7058>You should make them a witch pie, I think that's the best remedy for your problem.</t7058><t7059>”</t7059>
<t7060>“Oh Great God, help me, Lord Sid, am I going to make a witch beetle?</t7060> <t7061>I haven't even heard of it before.</t7061><t7062>”</t7062>
<t7063>“Alright, alright, it seems I will have to do it myself.</t7063><t7064>”</t7064>
<t7065>“Are you really going to do it?</t7065> <t7066>My dear, are you saying it's true?</t7066> <t7067>I'll kiss your hands and feet, please just do it!</t7067><t7068>”</t7068>
<t7069>“Alright, I will do it; after all, you have a special place; you treated us very well and showed us the runaway black man.</t7069> <t7070>But you must be very careful.</t7070> <t7071>When we come back, turn your back; no matter what we put in your pan, do not look at what it is.</t7071> <t7072>Also, do not look while Jim is taking things from your pan…</t7072> <t7073>I don't know what will happen if you look.</t7073> <t7074>Above all, do not touch the witch's items.</t7074><t7075>”</t7075>
<t7076>“Touch it, Mr. Sid? What are you saying?</t7076> <t7077>Even if they gave me fourteen hundred billion dollars, I wouldn't touch it.</t7077><t7078>”</t7078>
<t7079>Chapter Thirty-Seven</t7079>
<t7080>Everything was arranged.</t7080> <t7081>Thus, we went to the pile in the backyard where old boots, rags, broken bottles, useless pots and pans, and other junk were found. After some searching, we found an old and deep pan, patched up its holes as best as we could to bake a pie in it, then took it to the cellar and filled it to the brim with flour. While preparing for breakfast, we also found two small nails.</t7081> <t7082>Tom said these would be suitable for the prisoner to carve his name and sufferings into the dungeon walls. Then he put one in Aunt Sally's apron pocket, which was hanging on a chair, and the other into the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which we saw on the drawer at that moment, because we had heard the children talking about their parents going to the runaway negro's house this morning. After that, we went to breakfast, and Tom put the tin spoon into Uncle Silas's coat pocket. Since Aunt Sally hadn't arrived yet, we waited at the table for a while.</t7082>
<t7083>When Aunt Sally arrived, she was bright red, her eyebrows were furrowed, and she barely waited for the prayer; then, while pouring coffee with one hand, she started hitting the nearest child's head with the thimble on her other hand's finger, saying:</t7083>
<t7084>“I searched upstairs, I searched downstairs, it's nowhere to be found, what happened to your other shirt?</t7084><t7085>”</t7085>
<t7086>I felt like I had slipped and fallen between my heart, lungs, and liver, then a hard piece of cornbread met a cough on its way down my throat and shot out of my mouth, exploding in the eye of one of the kids across the table.</t7086> <t7087>The child let out something like a war cry and writhed like a fishing worm, while Tom had turned almost purple up to his ears.</t7087> <t7088>Moreover, all of this happened in about a quarter of a minute.</t7088> <t7089>The breakfast table had become such a dangerous place that if there had been an auction at that moment, I would have sold myself at half price to escape.</t7089> <t7090>But after that, we pulled ourselves together – what had shaken us so much was the suddenness of the situation.</t7090>
<t7091>“Extremely unusual and strange, I can't understand it at all,” said Uncle Silas.</t7091> <t7092>“I know very well where I took it off, because…</t7092><t7093>”</t7093>
<t7094>“Because there was only one on it.</t7094> <t7095>Do you hear what you're saying?</t7095> <t7096>I know you took it off, and I have a much more reliable source than your hazy memory because I hung it on the clothesline yesterday...</t7096> <t7097>I saw it there with my own eyes.</t7097> <t7098>But it's gone now...</t7098> <t7099>there's no ifs or buts about it, the only thing we can do is for you to wear your red undershirt until I sew a new one.</t7099> <t7100>Moreover, this will be the third one in two years; one has to be constantly on guard so you don't go without a shirt; I can never understand how you manage to ruin so many shirts.</t7100> <t7101>All I can do is hope that at some point in your life you'll learn to take care of your shirts.</t7101><t7102>”</t7102>
<t7103>“I know, Sally, believe me, I'm doing my best.</t7103> <t7104>But it can't be entirely my fault, because you know that when they're not on me, I neither see them nor have anything to do with them; moreover, I don't think I could lose them at a moment when they're not on me.</t7104><t7105>”</t7105>
<t7106>“If you can't do it, it's not your fault, Silas… if you could, you would, surely.</t7106> <t7107>Moreover, the only thing missing isn't just the shirt.</t7107> <t7108>A spoon has gone missing, even other things have disappeared.</t7108> <t7109>There were ten spoons, but now there are only nine.</t7109> <t7110>Let's say the calf took the shirt, but calves definitely don't steal spoons, that's for sure.</t7110><t7111>”</t7111>
<t7112>“What else is gone, Sally?</t7112><t7113>”</t7113>
<t7114>“Six candles are missing...</t7114> <t7115>the candles are gone.</t7115> <t7116>Sometimes the mice take the candles away, I guess that's what happened this time too; anyway, I don't know how they don't take everything we have, you were supposed to block their holes, but you didn't; if they weren't so stupid, they would make a nest in your hair, Silas... you wouldn't even notice; but look, you can't blame the mice for the spoon, I know this for sure.</t7116><t7117>”</t7117>
<t7118>“Alright, Sally, my fault, I admit it; I was careless; but tomorrow I will definitely close those mouse holes.</t7118><t7119>”</t7119>
<t7120>"No way, don't rush at all, you can do it next year.</t7120> <t7121>Matilda Angelina Araminta Phelps!"</t7121>
<t7122>The thimble came down on the head and the child had to pull his empty claws out of the candy jar.</t7122> <t7123>Just then, the black woman entered the passage:</t7123>
<t7124>“Madam, one sheet is missing.</t7124><t7125>”</t7125>
<t7126>“Are we missing a sheet!</t7126> <t7127>For God's sake, what's happening?</t7127><t7128>”</t7128>
<t7129>“I will plug the holes right away today,” said Uncle Silas with sadness.</t7129>
<t7130>“Woman, be quiet!..</t7130> <t7131>Do you think the mice took the sheet?</t7131> <t7132>Where could the sheet have gone; Lize?</t7132><t7133>”</t7133>
<t7134>"I have no idea, Miss Sally.</t7134> <t7135>Yesterday it was on the clothesline, but now it's not there.</t7135><t7136>"</t7136>
<t7137>“The end of the world has come, I guess.</t7137> <t7138>I have never seen such nonsense in my life until today.</t7138> <t7139>A shirt, a sheet, a spoon, and six candles...</t7139><t7140>”</t7140>
<t7141>A young maid burst in, calling out, "Madam, one of the brass candlesticks is missing.</t7141><t7142>"</t7142>
<t7143>"Get out of here quickly, you shrew, or I'll smash the pot on your head!"</t7143><t7144></t7144>
<t7145>Aunt Sally had completely lost her mind.</t7145> <t7146>I started looking for an opportunity to slip away; I could wander in the forest until the weather softened a bit and then come back.</t7146> <t7147>Aunt Sally had lost control and was ranting while everyone else in the house was silent and looking down; finally, Uncle Silas reached into his pocket and pulled out the spoon with a somewhat bewildered expression.</t7147> <t7148>Aunt Sally froze with her mouth open and hands in the air; if you ask me, I wished I could be in Jerusalem or somewhere at that moment.</t7148> <t7149>But her state didn’t last long, because she said:</t7149>
<t7150>“Just as I expected.</t7150> <t7151>So it was in your pocket all along, I wonder if the other missing items are there too.</t7151> <t7152>How did the spoon get in there?</t7152><t7153>”</t7153>
<t7154>“I really don’t know, Sally,” he said apologetically, “otherwise I would tell you, you know.</t7154> <t7155>Before breakfast, I was working on Acts 17.</t7155> <t7156>I don’t know how it happened, but I must have unknowingly put it in my pocket thinking it was the Bible; it must be so, because the Bible is not in my pocket, but let me go and check, if the Bible is still in its previous place, I will be sure that I didn’t put it in my pocket, then I will put the Bible and take the spoon and put it in my pocket...</t7156><t7157>”</t7157>
<t7158>“Ah, for God's sake! Be quiet already!</t7158> <t7159>Get out, all of you, children and everyone, get out, and don't come near me until I get my head straight.</t7159><t7160>”</t7160>
<t7161>Even if he didn't speak loudly and said it to himself, I would still hear it; even if I were dead, I would immediately get up and obey.</t7161> <t7162>As we passed through the living room, the old man dropped the nail while taking his hat; he just bent down, picked up the nail, and placed it on the mantelpiece, then left without saying a word.</t7162> <t7163>Tom had seen what he did, and thinking about the spoon issue, he said:</t7163>
<t7164>“There is no point in sending anything with him anymore, he is not reliable.”</t7164> <t7165>Then he continued: “But he was very useful with the spoon, even without realizing it; so we should go and do something useful for him without his knowledge – let's plug the mouse holes.</t7165><t7166>”</t7166>
<t7167>There were indeed a lot of mouse holes in the cellar; we spent almost an hour, but in the end, we did a perfect job and tightly sealed all of them.</t7167> <t7168>Just as we finished our work, we heard someone coming down the stairs to the cellar, and we immediately turned off our light and hid; the old man was coming down absentmindedly with a candle in one hand and sealing materials in the other.</t7168> <t7169>He went from one mouse hole to another, visiting all the holes.</t7169> <t7170>Then, fiddling with the dripping parts of the candle in his hand, he stood there thinking for about five minutes.</t7170> <t7171>Finally, he slowly and dreamily murmured as he headed towards the stairs:</t7171>
<t7172>“I never remember when I did it.</t7172> <t7173>He now accepts that I am not guilty about the mice.</t7173> <t7174>But anyway…</t7174> <t7175>It's best to let it be.</t7175> <t7176>The other way wouldn't benefit anyone anyway.</t7176><t7177>”</t7177>
<t7178>He went up the stairs saying such things, and we followed him.</t7178> <t7179>He was a very charming old man.</t7179> <t7180>He always remained that way.</t7180>
<t7181>Tom was very worried about what we would do with the spoon, but we had to take it.</t7181> <t7182>So he sat down and started to think.</t7182> <t7183>After forming the plan in his mind, he told me what we would do; then we went and waited around the spoon basket until Aunt Sally came, Tom was counting the spoons and setting aside the ones he counted, I slipped one of the spoons into my cuff, Tom turned to him:</t7183>
<t7184>“Aunt Sally, there are still only nine spoons here.</t7184><t7185>”</t7185>
<t7186>“Go play with Git, don't disturb my peace,” said Aunt Sally.</t7186> <t7187>“I know how many there are, I counted them myself.</t7187><t7188>”</t7188>
<t7189>“But I counted them all twice, Aunt, there were nine.</t7189><t7190>”</t7190>
<t7191>He seemed to have completely lost his patience, but of course, he still came to count – anyone would have come.</t7191>
<t7192>“Damn it, there are only nine here!” he said.</t7192> <t7193>“Why, damn your spoon-like...</t7193> <t7194>may your name be cursed, let's count again, it's for the best.</t7194><t7195>”</t7195>
<t7196>I placed the spoon back among the others and when he finished counting, he said:</t7196>
<t7197>“God, give me patience, and now I have ten more!” He looked both angry and worried at the same time.</t7197> <t7198>But Tom intervened:</t7198>
<t7199>"No, Auntie, I don't think there are ten."</t7199><t7200>"</t7200>
<t7201>“You idiot, didn't you see what I just counted?</t7201><t7202>”</t7202>
<t7203>“I know, but…”</t7203><t7204>”</t7204>
<t7205>“Alright, let's count again then.</t7205><t7206>”</t7206>
<t7207>Upon this, I took one of them, and when she counted, there were still nine spoons.</t7207> <t7208>Aunt Sally was now completely out of her mind...</t7208> <t7209>She was trembling and had gone mad.</t7209> <t7210>But she counted again, and again, until she got so dizzy that she started counting wrong.</t7210> <t7211>If the count was correct three times, it was wrong three times.</t7211> <t7212>Upon this, she couldn't take it anymore, grabbed the basket and threw it, managing to hit the cat; she immediately disappeared and asked us to leave her alone for a while, saying that if we bothered her until dinner, she would skin us alive.</t7212> <t7213>Thus, we had secured that single spoon; while she was giving us the marching orders, I slipped the spoon into the pocket of her apron; thus, Jim was able to get both the spoon and the nail before noon.</t7213> <t7214>Because of this, we were very pleased with ourselves, and Tom said we had been rewarded for our trouble twice over, because even if they took her life, his aunt would never count those spoons again.</t7214> <t7215>No matter how many times she counted, she wouldn't believe she had counted correctly.</t7215> <t7216>Later, he said that his aunt couldn't pull herself together for the next three days, and if anyone asked her to count again, she would be ready to commit murder.</t7216>
<t7217>Upon this, that night we hung the sheet back on the clothesline and stole a sheet from Aunt Sally's closet; for a few days, we kept putting it back and stealing it again; finally, she lost count of how many sheets she had and said she didn't care, wouldn't wear out her soul over it, and would rather die than count the sheets again.</t7217>
<t7218>Thanks to the calf, the mice, and the counting confusion, our problems with shirts, sheets, spoons, and candles were resolved; as for the candlestick, it didn't cause much of a fuss and would eventually be forgotten over time.</t7218>
<t7219>But making börek was a troublesome task, it seemed like we would never get rid of the trouble of baking that börek.</t7219> <t7220>We set up our arrangement somewhere deep in the forest and started baking the börek; in the end, we managed to bake it, and it turned out quite well, but it took more than a day; we had to use three pans full of flour, and while working on it, we burned ourselves in many places and our eyes were scorched by the smoke; because what we really needed was the outside of the börek and we couldn't get it right, every time the top would collapse inward.</t7220> <t7221>But in the end, we managed to get it right, that is, we finally figured out to bake the ladder inside the börek.</t7221> <t7222>For this, we went to Jim's place the second night, tore the sheet into small strips and tied them together, and by the time we had made a very nice rope long enough to hang a man, it was still far from morning.</t7222> <t7223>But we pretended that preparing the rope took nine months.</t7223>
<t7224>We took the rope and went to the forest before noon, but we couldn't fit it into the pastry.</t7224> <t7225>Since we made it from a large sheet, we had enough rope to fit into forty pastries if we wanted; moreover, there was plenty left for soup, sausages, or any other meals we preferred.</t7225> <t7226>This rope would be enough for a large dinner.</t7226>
<t7227>But we didn't need that much.</t7227> <t7228>We only needed enough rope to fit into the pie, so we threw the rest away.</t7228> <t7229>Fearing that the metal would melt, we didn't make the pie in the pan we found; instead, we used Uncle Silas's beautiful brass bed warmer.</t7229> <t7230>He valued this warmer greatly because this long-handled bed warmer, belonging to his ancestors, had come over with William the Conqueror on the Mayflower or one of the first ships, and it was stored in the attic along with a lot of old pots and other valuable things; their value, of course, came not from their monetary worth but from being heirlooms; so we took this bed warmer and went to the woods, but we failed with the first pies because we didn't quite know how to do it, but on the last try, it rose beautifully.</t7230> <t7231>To cook it properly, we first spread the dough on the bottom of the warmer, placed it on the coals, and then put the rope ladder on top of the dough.</t7231> <t7232>After spreading another layer of dough on top and closing the lid, we placed pieces of coal on top; thanks to the long handle, we comfortably held the pan about a meter and a half away without being affected by the heat, and after fifteen minutes, we had an appetizing pie.</t7232> <t7233>But anyone who tried to eat the pie would need a few boxes of toothpicks.</t7233> <t7234>Because if swallowing the rope ladder inside the pie isn't hard, then I don't know what I'm talking about.</t7234> <t7235>Also, the person eating it would be writhing in stomach pain.</t7235>
<t7236>When we placed the witch pie on Jim's tray, Nat wasn't looking; we had also placed three iron plates right under the pie; that way, Jim could take everything, and the moment he was alone, he opened the pie and hid the rope ladder inside the straw mattress, carved some marks on the iron plate, and threw it out the window hole.</t7236>
<t7237>Thirty-Eighth Chapter</t7237>
<t7238>Making the pens was a difficult job that required a lot of effort, as was making the saw; but Jim said the hardest part would be carving writing into the walls.</t7238> <t7239>But these were things that the prisoner absolutely had to write on the wall.</t7239> <t7240>No matter what, they had to be written; Tom said he was obliged to do it; there wasn't a single case where prisoners didn't carve writing and their coat of arms into the wall before leaving.</t7240>
<t7241>“Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he said; “Look at Gilford Dudley, at old Northumberland!</t7241> <t7242>What does it matter if doing this is harder than making a camel jump through a hoop?</t7242> <t7243>What are we going to do then?</t7243> <t7244>Are we going to beat around the bush?</t7244> <t7245>Jim has to carve his inscription on the wall, engrave his coat of arms.</t7245> <t7246>Everyone is doing it.</t7246><t7247>”</t7247>
<t7248>"But Master Tom, I don't have a master," said Jim.</t7248> <t7249>"In fact, I don't have anything other than these pots and pans and an old shirt, and I need to use them for daily writing anyway.</t7249><t7250>"</t7250>
<t7251>“Ah, you just don't understand, Jim, a coat of arms is something very different.</t7251><t7252>”</t7252>
<t7253>“Still, Jim is right in saying he doesn't have a coat of arms,” I said, “because he really doesn't have one.</t7253><t7254>”</t7254>
<t7255>“We probably know,” said Tom, “but there will be one before this is over…</t7255> <t7256>because he does everything right and there won't be the slightest flaw in his record.</t7256><t7257>”</t7257>
<t7258>Jim and I started sharpening the pencils on a piece of brick; Jim was making his out of brass, and I was using the spoon. Meanwhile, Tom was lost in thought about the coat of arms.</t7258> <t7259>A little later, he said that he had come up with a lot of beautiful coats of arms and couldn't decide which one to choose, but he would probably settle on one eventually.</t7259>
<t7260>“The crest will be curved or on the right side.</t7260> <t7261>Inside the band surrounding the crest, there will be a dark red diagonal stripe and an outstretched dog representing the people.</t7261> <t7262>Under the dog's paw, there will be a solid chain representing slavery.</t7262> <t7263>At the top, there will be a green ornament and three vertical lines on a sky blue background with dots spread in the middle of a deliberate zigzag mark.</t7263> <t7264>At the top, a picture of a runaway black man: Pitch black, with a bundle on his shoulder over the mark indicating illegitimacy.</t7264> <t7265>There are two red lines supporting him, which represent you and me.</t7265> <t7266>At the very bottom, a curved crest band.</t7266> <t7267>There is an inscription on it: Maggiore fretta, minore otto.</t7267> <t7268>I saw it in a book...</t7268> <t7269>it means the more you hurry, the slower you go.</t7269><t7270>”</t7270>
<t7271>“Wow, so what does the rest mean?” I asked.</t7271>
<t7272>“We don't have time to waste on this, we need to start digging immediately.</t7272><t7273>”</t7273>
<t7274>“Couldn't you at least tell me the meaning of some of them?</t7274> <t7275>For example, what is a strip?</t7275><t7276>”</t7276>
<t7277>"Strip... strip thing...</t7277> <t7278>you don't need to know what it is.</t7278> <t7279>I'll show you how to do it, and then you'll do it.</t7279><t7280>"</t7280>
<t7281>“Don't break me, you can tell any person, can't you, Tom? What is the sign indicating illegitimacy?</t7281><t7282>”</t7282>
<t7283>“You are asking unnecessary questions.</t7283> <t7284>It just has to be there.</t7284> <t7285>All the nobles have it.</t7285><t7286>”</t7286>
<t7287>This was just right for her.</t7287> <t7288>If she didn't feel like explaining something to you, she wouldn't explain it.</t7288> <t7289>Even if you nagged her for a week, you wouldn't get a single word out of her.</t7289>
<t7290>After completely deciding on the weapon matter, he turned to the remaining part of the work, namely planning our sorrowful inscription.</t7290> <t7291>Like all prisoners, Jim should also have such an inscription.</t7291> <t7292>He made up a bunch of words and wrote them down on a piece of paper, then read them aloud:</t7292>
<t7293>1.</t7293> <t7294>A captive heart withered away here.</t7294>
<t7295>2.</t7295> <t7296>A poor prisoner, separated from the world and his friends, spent his miserable life here.</t7296>
<t7297>3.</t7297> <t7298>A completely lonely heart was broken here, a worn-out soul found peace after thirty-seven years of complete solitary captivity.</t7298>
<t7299>4.</t7299> <t7300>Homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven years of arduous captivity, the noble stranger who found peace here is the true son of Louis XIV.</t7300> <t7301>Louis XIV's own son.</t7301>
<t7302>Tom's voice was trembling as he read these, he was almost about to cry.</t7302> <t7303>After finishing reading, he couldn't decide which one Jim should carve into the wall, they were all equally good; but finally, he said he would allow him to carve all of them.</t7303> <t7304>Jim reminded him that carving so many words into the logs with a nail would take at least a year, and besides, he didn't even know how to write the letters; but Tom said he would draw the letters himself beforehand and all Jim had to do was follow the lines and carve.</t7304> <t7305>But he soon changed his mind:</t7305>
<t7306>“I thought about it, logs won't do; there can't be log walls in dungeons: We need to carve the inscription into a rock.</t7306> <t7307>Let's bring a rock.</t7307><t7308>”</t7308>
<t7309>Jim immediately interjected, saying that carving into the rock would be even harder than carving into the log.</t7309> <t7310>It would take so long to carve those words into a rock that it would never see the light of day again.</t7310> <t7311>But Tom said he would allow me to help him.</t7311> <t7312>Then he looked at what Jim and I had done to the pens.</t7312> <t7313>It was an extremely slow and laborious task, and it not only prevented my hands from healing but also made it seem like we had made almost no progress.</t7313>
<t7314>“I know how we will do it,” said Tom.</t7314> <t7315>“We need to find a rock for the coat of arms and the mournful inscription, then we can kill two birds with one stone with that rock.</t7315> <t7316>Inside the mill, there is a large and impressive millstone, we will take it, engrave everything on it, and sharpen the pens and saw on it as well.</t7316>
<t7317>This wasn't a bad idea.</t7317> <t7318>It was truly a tough millstone; still, we felt we could bring it.</t7318> <t7319>It wasn't midnight yet, so we left things to Jim and set off towards the mill.</t7319> <t7320>We removed the millstone from its place and started rolling it towards home, but this was really beyond us.</t7320> <t7321>Despite doing our best, we couldn't prevent it from toppling over from time to time, and each time we narrowly escaped being crushed underneath it.</t7321> <t7322>"By the time we get there, one of us will definitely be stuck under this stone," said Tom.</t7322> <t7323>We got it halfway, but we were too exhausted to take another step, we were about to drown in our own sweat.</t7323> <t7324>We realized we couldn't manage this, we had to go and get Jim.</t7324> <t7325>Jim lifted the bed and freed the chain from the bedpost, then wrapped the chain around his neck and we crawled out through the hole together.</t7325> <t7326>We went with Jim, easily lifted the millstone, and started carrying it, while Tom supervised us.</t7326> <t7327>He surpassed all the children I had seen in supervising.</t7327> <t7328>He knew how everything should be done.</t7328>
<t7329>Our hole was quite wide, but still not big enough to pass the millstone through. However, Jim took the pickaxe and soon enlarged the hole.</t7329> <t7330>Then Tom used a nail to carve letters onto the stone and stood over Jim to make sure he continued; instead of a chisel, he would use the nail, and instead of a hammer, he would use an iron bar we found among the odds and ends in the storeroom. He told him to work until the remainder of his candle was used up, and then he could go to bed, but he had to place the millstone under his mattress and sleep on it.</t7330> <t7331>Afterwards, we helped Jim reattach the chain to the bed leg, and we were ready to go to bed ourselves.</t7331> <t7332>But it seemed like Tom had come up with something new.</t7332>
<t7333>"Are there any spiders here, Jim?" he asked.</t7333>
<t7334>“No, master, thank God, no, Master Tom.</t7334><t7335>”</t7335>
<t7336>“Okay, we will bring it to you.</t7336><t7337>”</t7337>
<t7338>“Oh, live long, my flower's corner, I don't want spiders.</t7338> <t7339>I'm already scared of spiders.</t7339> <t7340>If they come, then rattlesnakes will follow.</t7340><t7341>”</t7341>
<t7342>After thinking for a minute or two, Tom said:</t7342>
<t7343>“Actually, it's a good idea.</t7343> <t7344>I think it can be done.</t7344> <t7345>In fact, it must be done; it seems reasonable.</t7345> <t7346>Yes, this is a top-notch idea.</t7346> <t7347>Where can you hide it?</t7347><t7348>”</t7348>
<t7349>“What will I hide, Master Tom?</t7349><t7350>”</t7350>
<t7351>“A rattlesnake, of course.</t7351><t7352>”</t7352>
<t7353>“Trust me, you follow me, Master Tom! If a rattlesnake comes out of the grass, I'll jump out of this log with my bare head.</t7353><t7354>”</t7354>
<t7355>"But Jim, after a while, you won't be afraid of it at all.</t7355> <t7356>You can tame it.</t7356><t7357>"</t7357>
<t7358>“Tame it?</t7358><t7359>”</t7359>
<t7360>“Yes… very easy.</t7360> <t7361>All animals feel gratitude towards kindness and caresses, and they wouldn't even think of harming the people who caress them.</t7361> <t7362>Every book says so.</t7362> <t7363>You try it…</t7363> <t7364>I don't want anything else; just try for two or three days.</t7364> <t7365>Shortly after you take it, it will love you, sleep with you, not stay away from you for even a moment, allow you to wrap it around your neck and put its head in your mouth.</t7365><t7366>”</t7366>
<t7367>“Don’t say such things, Master Tom… I can’t stand it anymore!</t7367> <t7368>Letting him stick his head into my mouth… for the sake of kindness, is that it?</t7368> <t7369>It would take forever to ask him for that.</t7369> <t7370>Besides, I don’t even want him to sleep with me.</t7370><t7371>”</t7371>
<t7372>“Don't act so foolishly, Jim.</t7372> <t7373>It is mandatory for prisoners to have a quiet pet; if no one has had a rattlesnake before, the honor of being the first person to try this, instead of other conceivable ways to save their life, is greater.</t7373><t7374>”</t7374>
<t7375>"But Master Tom, I don't want such a big reputation.</t7375> <t7376>If the snake bites Jim's jaw, what good is the reputation to Jim then? No, master, I don't want to do such things.</t7376><t7377>"</t7377>
<t7378>“You are something else, what do you have to lose by trying?</t7378> <t7379>I just want you to try…</t7379> <t7380>If it doesn't work, you don't need to keep feeding it.</t7380><t7381>”</t7381>
<t7382>“But while I was trying to tame it, it would finish me off on the street.</t7382> <t7383>I'm willing to do almost anything that makes sense to me, but if Huck and you bring me a rattlesnake and ask me to tame it, I'll leave immediately, there's no other way.</t7383><t7384>”</t7384>
<t7385>“Alright then, if you are so stubborn, let it be as you say.</t7385> <t7386>We will bring you a few small snakes, you can put buttons or something on their tails and pretend they are rattlesnakes, this should be sufficient.</t7386><t7387>”</t7387>
<t7388>“I can endure it with ten, Master Tom, but without ten, I will be much more comfortable, don't forget that.</t7388> <t7389>Being a prisoner is such a hard and troublesome job, my friend.</t7389><t7390>”</t7390>
<t7391>“Of course it is, but only if you do it right.</t7391> <t7392>So, is there a mouse here?</t7392><t7393>”</t7393>
<t7394>“No, master, I have never buried a child.</t7394><t7395>”</t7395>
<t7396>“Alright, we will bring you a few.</t7396><t7397>”</t7397>
<t7398>“Master Tom, I don't want any rats.</t7398> <t7399>They are very troublesome creatures, they disturb people, when you're trying to sleep they crawl over you and bite your feet.</t7399> <t7400>No, master, if you must bring something, just bring snakes, I don't want rats, they are of no use to me anyway.</t7400><t7401>”</t7401>
<t7402>“But Jim, you have to have mice... everyone has mice.</t7402> <t7403>So stop complaining already.</t7403> <t7404>Is there such a thing as a prisoner without mice?</t7404> <t7405>I've never heard of such a thing in my life.</t7405> <t7406>In fact, they train the mice, pet them, teach them tricks, and develop a bond with them.</t7406> <t7407>But you should play music for them.</t7407> <t7408>Do you have the necessary instruments for that?</t7408><t7409>”</t7409>
<t7410>“I only have a mountain and a piece of paper, and also a mouth harmonica, but whether you want to listen to the mouth harmonica, I don't really think so.</t7410><t7411>”</t7411>
<t7412>“Is that possible? Of course, they listen.</t7412> <t7413>They don't care what kind of music it is.</t7413> <t7414>A mouth harp is perfectly suitable for a mouse.</t7414> <t7415>All animals love music…</t7415> <t7416>especially in a prison environment, they adore it.</t7416> <t7417>Particularly sad music, and anyway, a mouth harp doesn't produce any other kind of music.</t7417> <t7418>It always catches their interest; they get up to see what is troubling you.</t7418> <t7419>Yes, now it's right, you're in a very good state now.</t7419> <t7420>At night before going to bed, in the early morning hours, you want to sit in your bed and play the mouth harp; play 'The Last Ring Broke'...</t7420> <t7421>it's the piece that interests the mice the most: After playing for about two minutes, you'll see that all the mice, snakes, spiders, and other things are worried about you and come to you.</t7421> <t7422>They will literally climb all over you and have a great time.</t7422><t7423>”</t7423>
<t7424>“Ten years is a long time, Master Tom, but how will Jim spend that time?</t7424> <t7425>I don't understand what good this will do.</t7425> <t7426>But if I must, I will do it.</t7426> <t7427>Probably the best thing is to keep the animals happy so that there won't be any trouble.</t7427><t7428>”</t7428>
<t7429>Tom thought for a while longer, but it seemed like nothing else came to mind. Suddenly, he started speaking again:</t7429>
<t7430>“Hah…</t7430> <t7431>I forgot something.</t7431> <t7432>Do you think you can grow flowers here?</t7432><t7433>”</t7433>
<t7434>"I don't know, maybe I can manage, Master Tom; but the ox is very stubborn, and the flowers can't help me with my work.</t7434> <t7435>It's very difficult.</t7435><t7436>"</t7436>
<t7437>"Still, you should give it a try.</t7437> <t7438>Some prisoners have managed to do it.</t7438><t7439>"</t7439>
<t7440>“A huge catfish might grow here too, Master Tom, but it's not worth the trouble, I'm telling you from the start.</t7440><t7441>”</t7441>
<t7442>"Don't think like that.</t7442> <t7443>We'll bring you a small one, you can plant it in that corner over there, and it will grow and thrive.</t7443> <t7444>Also, don't call it mullein, call it Pitchiola...</t7444> <t7445>that's its real name when it's in prison.</t7445> <t7446>And you need to water it with your tears.</t7446><t7447>"</t7447>
<t7448>"Why, there's plenty of water in this, Tom.</t7448><t7449>"</t7449>
<t7450>“You didn't want to use water, you should have watered it with your tears instead.</t7450> <t7451>This is always done this way.</t7451><t7452>”</t7452>
<t7453>“But Master Tom, can I use water for a big plant, and for another one, can I grow it with tears, is that okay?</t7453><t7454>”</t7454>
<t7455>"That's not what's important.</t7455> <t7456>It must be watered with your tears.</t7456><t7457>"</t7457>
<t7458>“But the flower died because of me, Master Tom, yes, it definitely died; because I don't cry easily.</t7458><t7459>”</t7459>
<t7460>Tom was cornered.</t7460> <t7461>But after thinking for a bit, he told Jim that he should do his best to make his eyes water by cutting an onion.</t7461> <t7462>He promised to go to the black cabins in the morning and secretly put an onion in Jim's coffee pot.</t7462> <t7463>Jim said he preferred us to send tobacco in his coffee; he didn't like any of the tasks asked of him; raising cow tails, playing music to mice with a mouth harp, feeding and petting snakes and spiders or other animals were not sensible tasks; besides, he was already busy with pens, inscriptions, and diaries, which had made being a prisoner the most challenging, worrying, and responsible job he had ever seen.</t7463> <t7464>Hearing this, Tom completely lost his patience; he told Jim that he had been given more chances to become famous as a prisoner than he could ever have, but he didn't know how to appreciate these chances and didn't deserve them.</t7464> <t7465>Jim regretted what he said, promised not to behave like that again, and we went out to sleep.</t7465>
<t7466>Chapter Thirty-Nine</t7466>
<t7467>In the morning, we went to the village and bought a mouse trap in the shape of a wire cage, reopened the best of the holes we had blocked, and caught about fifteen of the largest mice in about an hour; then we took the cage and hid it under Aunt Sally's bed, thinking it was safe.</t7467> <t7468>But when we went out to hunt spiders, Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Alexander Phelps, you found the cage, got curious if the mice would come out, opened the lid, and the mice got out, and then didn't Aunt Sally come into the room...</t7468> <t7469>When we came back, she was on top of the bed screaming her head off, and the mice were doing their best to keep her entertained.</t7469> <t7470>So she gave us all a good beating, and because of that meddlesome kid, we had to spend almost two extra hours catching another fifteen or sixteen mice, and the ones we caught weren't much to look at, because the first ones we caught were the finest of the bunch.</t7470> <t7471>I had never seen such robust mice together as the ones we caught the first time.</t7471>
<t7472>We had a magnificent collection of spiders, insects, frogs, caterpillars, and similar things; we even thought of finding a beehive, but we couldn't manage that.</t7472> <t7473>The bee family was fully at home.</t7473> <t7474>We didn't give up immediately, we lingered there as long as we could, either they would get tired and leave, or we would.</t7474> <t7475>In the end, we gave up.</t7475> <t7476>We applied andiz powder to the places they stung us, we felt a bit relieved, but for a while, we couldn't sit comfortably on our bottoms.</t7476> <t7477>Then we went snake hunting, caught a few dozen small snakes, put them in a sack, and then hid the sack in our room; by then, it was dinner time, we had worked hard all day and were starving.</t7477> <t7478>But when we returned, we couldn't find a single snake in the room – we had left the sack's mouth loose, and the snakes had found a way out.</t7478> <t7479>It didn't really matter, though, because they were still somewhere in the house.</t7479> <t7480>We thought we could catch some of them again.</t7480> <t7481>For a while, there was never a shortage of snakes in the house.</t7481> <t7482>From time to time, you could see them falling from the roof beams and other places; they generally fell onto your plate or slid down your neck, meaning they mostly appeared in the places you least wanted them to.</t7482> <t7483>They were very beautiful and striped snakes, even if a million of them came, they wouldn't harm you; but it didn't matter to Aunt Sally, she was disgusted by snakes of any kind, she couldn't stand them at all; if one of them fell on her, she would drop whatever she was doing and dash outside.</t7483> <t7484>I had never seen a woman like her.</t7484> <t7485>Moreover, her screams could reach the heavens.</t7485> <t7486>The poor woman couldn't even hold the snakes with tongs.</t7486> <t7487>When she opened her bed and found a snake inside, she would throw herself outside and scream so loudly that you would think the house was on fire.</t7487> <t7488>Aunt Sally disturbed the peace of the big man so much that he got to the point where he wished snakes had never been created.</t7488> <t7489>Even a week after the last snake was thrown out of the house, Aunt Sally still hadn't recovered; she didn't even seem like she would recover; if you touched her neck with a feather while she was sitting and thinking about something, she would jump three meters into the air.</t7489> <t7490>It was a very strange thing.</t7490> <t7491>But Tom said all women were like that.</t7491> <t7492>For some reason, they were created that way.</t7492>
<t7493>Whenever Aunt Sally saw a snake, we would get a beating; moreover, she said that if we filled the house with snakes again, the beatings would be nothing compared to what she would do.</t7493> <t7494>I didn't mind the beatings much because they hardly hurt, but catching another sack of snakes was no easy task.</t7494> <t7495>Still, we caught more snakes and completed the others.</t7495> <t7496>There was no place as lively as Jim's cabin anymore; all the animals would flock to Jim to listen to music.</t7496> <t7497>Jim couldn't warm up to the spiders, and the spiders couldn't warm up to him.</t7497> <t7498>They attacked him at every opportunity and made his life miserable.</t7498> <t7499>Additionally, Jim complained that there was no place for him to sleep between the mice, snakes, and millstones; even if he managed to squeeze in and lie down, he couldn't sleep because there was constant movement in the bed; since the creatures didn't all sleep at the same time, they took turns using the bed, so while the snakes slept, the mice would be running around; when the mice slept, the snakes would take over.</t7499> <t7500>One gang was always under Jim while the other was holding a circus on top of him, and if he tried to find another place to sleep, the spiders would attack him while he walked.</t7500> <t7501>He said that if he ever got out, he would never be a prisoner again, even if they paid him.</t7501>
<t7502>At the end of three weeks, everything had finally fallen into place.</t7502> <t7503>The shirt had been sent in the pie ahead of schedule, and Jim would get up and write in his journal while the ink was still fresh every time a rat bit him; the pens were made, the inscription and others were carved on the millstone; we had cut the bed leg in two and eaten the sawdust, after which we were struck with a terrible stomachache.</t7503> <t7504>We all thought we were going to die, but nothing happened.</t7504> <t7505>In my life, I had never seen sawdust so hard, sitting in one's stomach like a stone; Tom said the same thing.</t7505> <t7506>But as I said, we had finally finished all the work, and we were all exhausted, but Jim was almost pickled by now.</t7506> <t7507>The old man wrote letters several times to the plantation south of Orleans, asking them to come and get their runaway Negro, but received no reply, because there was no such plantation; he then said he would place an ad for Jim in the St.</t7507> <t7508>Louis and New Orleans newspapers; when he mentioned the St. Louis newspapers, my hair stood on end, we had no time to lose.</t7508> <t7509>Upon this, Tom said it was time for the anonymous letters.</t7509>
<t7510>"Oh really?" I said.</t7510>
<t7511>“Warnings to people that something is going to happen.</t7511> <t7512>Some give their warnings this way; some give them that way.</t7512> <t7513>But there is always someone who spies and sends a warning to the castle's chief.</t7513> <t7514>XVI.</t7514> <t7515>When Louis was about to escape from the Tuileries, a maid did this.</t7515> <t7516>I think it's a very good method, anonymous letters too.</t7516> <t7517>We will use both.</t7517> <t7518>Also, it is customary for the prisoner's mother to switch clothes with him; thus the mother stays inside and the prisoner leaves in his mother's clothes.</t7518> <t7519>We will do that too.</t7519><t7520>”</t7520>
<t7521>“But Tom, why would we want to warn people that something is going to happen?</t7521> <t7522>Let them find out for themselves…</t7522> <t7523>after all, they are the ones keeping watch.</t7523><t7524>”</t7524>
<t7525>“I know that too, but you can't trust them.</t7525> <t7526>It has been like this from the very beginning...</t7526> <t7527>They left everything for us to do.</t7527> <t7528>They are so naive and thick-headed that they don't realize anything.</t7528> <t7529>That's why if we don't warn them, there will be no one or nothing to intervene with us, after working so hard and suffering so much, this escape will work perfectly: It will have no meaning...</t7529> <t7530>There will be no place left to remember.</t7530><t7531>”</t7531>
<t7532>“If you ask me, this would be the best, Tom.</t7532><t7533>”</t7533>
<t7534>"Oh, come on, you too," he said, grimacing.</t7534>
<t7535>“I'm not complaining,” I said.</t7535> <t7536>“If you think it's appropriate, it's fine with me too.</t7536> <t7537>But how will you handle the maid issue?</t7537><t7538>”</t7538>
<t7539>“You will be the maid.</t7539> <t7540>You will sneak in late at night and steal that half-breed girl's dress.</t7540><t7541>”</t7541>
<t7542>“But Tom, we'll get into trouble in the morning, the girl probably doesn't have any other clothes.</t7542><t7543>”</t7543>
<t7544>“I know, but you will take the dress for only fifteen minutes; all you have to do is take the anonymous letter and throw it inside under the front door.</t7544><t7545>”</t7545>
<t7546>“Alright then, I'll do it; but I could have carried the letter just fine with my own clothes too.</t7546><t7547>”</t7547>
<t7548>“But then you won't look like a servant girl, will you?</t7548><t7549>”</t7549>
<t7550>"No, but there won't be anyone to see what I look like anyway."</t7550>
<t7551>“This has nothing to do with the matter.</t7551> <t7552>What is important for us is to do our duty and not to care whether others see us or not.</t7552> <t7553>Can't you act a bit more principled?</t7553><t7554>”</t7554>
<t7555>“Alright, okay, I didn't say anything; I am a maid.</t7555> <t7556>Who is Jim's mother then?</t7556><t7557>”</t7557>
<t7558>"Her mother is me.</t7558> <t7559>I will swipe one of Aunt Sally's dresses.</t7559><t7560>"</t7560>
<t7561>“Alright, then when Jim and I escape, you will need to stay in the cabin.</t7561><t7562>”</t7562>
<t7563>“Not really.</t7563> <t7564>I will fill Jim’s clothes with straw and lay them in bed to represent his disguised mother, and Jim will take a woman’s dress from me and wear it, and we will all retreat together.</t7564> <t7565>Retreating is what you call the escape of a prisoner with honor.</t7565> <t7566>For example, when a king escapes, he retreats.</t7566> <t7567>The same applies to the king’s son; whether he is legitimate or illegitimate does not change anything.</t7567>
<t7568>Thereupon, Tom wrote the anonymous letter, I stole the mulatto girl's dress, and that night I wore the dress and slipped the letter under the front door as Tom instructed.</t7568> <t7569>The letter said:</t7569>
<t7570>Attention.</t7570> <t7571>Trouble is coming.</t7571> <t7572>Keep your eyes wide open.</t7572>
<t7573>A FRIEND</t7573>
<t7574>The next night we pasted Tom's drawing of a skull and crossbones made with blood on the front door; the following night we pasted a picture of a coffin on the back door.</t7574> <t7575>I had never seen a family so worried before.</t7575> <t7576>If the house were haunted, with ghosts jumping out from behind everything, from under the beds, flying in the air, they wouldn't be this scared.</t7576> <t7577>If a door slammed, Aunt Sally would jump and scream "Oh!", if something fell, she would immediately jump and scream "Oh!", if you touched her absentmindedly, she would do the same; she couldn't feel at ease no matter which way she turned, because she constantly thought something was behind her – so she frequently spun around suddenly and screamed "Oh!" and before she could settle down, she would turn the other way and scream again; she was afraid to go to bed, but she was also afraid to sit down.</t7577> <t7578>So our plan is working very well, said Tom; he said he had never seen a plan work so perfectly.</t7578> <t7579>All of this showed how correctly we had done everything.</t7579>
<t7580>According to what Tom said, it was time to set off the big bomb!</t7580> <t7581>The next morning at dawn, we prepared another letter and started thinking about how to deliver it, because we had heard at dinner that they would station a black man at each door all night.</t7581> <t7582>Tom slid down the lightning rod to scout around and, finding the black man at the back door asleep, slipped the letter down his neck and returned.</t7582> <t7583>This letter read as follows:</t7583>
<t7584>Don't turn me in, I want to be your friend.</t7584> <t7585>A bloodthirsty gang from the Indian Territory is going to steal your runaway negro tonight, they were trying to scare you into staying home and not interfering with them.</t7585> <t7586>I am also part of the gang, but I am a religious person and I want to leave the gang and live an honest life again, so I decided to inform you of this diabolical plan.</t7586> <t7587>At exactly midnight, they will come from the north, jump over the fence, and unlock the negro's cabin with a skeleton key to take him away.</t7587> <t7588>I will supposedly stand a bit far away and if I see any danger, I will blow a horn; but actually, I will bleat like a sheep when they get inside and won't blow the horn at all; while they are unchaining the negro, you can quietly approach and lock them all inside, then kill them at a suitable time.</t7588> <t7589>Do not disobey my words, if you act on your own, they will suspect something and turn the place into hell.</t7589> <t7590>I don't want any reward, all I want is to do the right thing.</t7590>
<t7591>A FRIEND</t7591>
<t7592>Chapter Forty</t7592>
<t7593>After breakfast, we were feeling very good, we took our lunch with us and went fishing on the river with my canoe, we had a great time, we went and checked the raft and saw that it was in good condition, then when we returned late for dinner, we found them anxious and worried, not knowing what to do.</t7593> <t7594>Right after dinner, they sent us to our beds and definitely did not tell us what the problem was.</t7594> <t7595>The last letter was not mentioned at all, but there was no need for that, because we knew as much as everyone else, after climbing the stairs halfway, when Aunt Sally turned her back, we quietly went to the cupboard in the cellar, took quite a bit of food, went up to our room, and lay in our beds; at half-past eleven, we got up again, Tom immediately put on the dress he had stolen from Aunt Sally and just as he was about to leave with the food, he stopped:</t7595>
<t7596>"Where is the butter?</t7596><t7597>"</t7597>
<t7598>“I had taken a mold,” I said, “I had put it on the cornbread.</t7598><t7599>”</t7599>
<t7600>“So, you must have taken it out but didn't put it in the bag,” he said, “because it's not here.</t7600><t7601>”</t7601>
<t7602>"We can manage without butter," I said.</t7602>
<t7603>“We would manage better if we had butter,” he said; “all you have to do is go down to the cellar and get it.</t7603> <t7604>Then you come down from the lightning rod.</t7604> <t7605>Now I'm going to go and stuff Jim's clothes with straw, pretending to be his disguised mother; when you get there, be ready to bleat like a sheep and run away immediately.</t7605><t7606>”</t7606>
<t7607>So he went outside, and I went down to the cellar.</t7607> <t7608>The butter pat, the size of a fist, was still where I had left it. I took it along with the bread underneath, turned off my light, and started to quietly climb the stairs.</t7608> <t7609>I reached the ground floor without any issues, but there Aunt Sally suddenly appeared with a candle. I quickly stuffed what I was holding into my hat and put the hat on my head.</t7609> <t7610>At that very moment, she saw me:</t7610>
<t7611>“Had you gone down to the cellar?</t7611><t7612>”</t7612>
<t7613>“Yes.</t7613><t7614>”</t7614>
<t7615>“What were you doing there?</t7615><t7616>”</t7616>
<t7617>"Nothing.</t7617><t7618>"</t7618>
<t7619>"Nothing at all, you say!</t7619><t7620>"</t7620>
<t7621>“Yes.</t7621><t7622>”</t7622>
<t7623>“Alright, what came to your mind at this hour of the night that made you come down, let's see?</t7623><t7624>”</t7624>
<t7625>“I don't know.</t7625><t7626>”</t7626>
<t7627>"Don't you know?</t7627> <t7628>Don't give me such answers, Tom, I want to know what you're doing down there.</t7628><t7629>"</t7629>
<t7630>“I wasn't doing anything, Aunt Sally, I swear, I wasn't doing anything.</t7630><t7631>”</t7631>
<t7632>If it were any other time, he would probably let me go, but I guess because there were too many strange things going on, even the slightest thing that didn't seem right was worrying him; so he said with a very determined expression:</t7632>
<t7633>"Go straight to the living room and wait until I come."</t7633> <t7634>"You definitely did something naughty, and you can't go anywhere until I find out what it is."</t7634><t7635>"</t7635>
<t7636>When I opened the door and entered the living room, he moved away.</t7636> <t7637>My God, it was so crowded inside!</t7637> <t7638>There were fifteen farmers, each holding a rifle.</t7638> <t7639>Suddenly, I felt faint and barely managed to collapse into a chair.</t7639> <t7640>While sitting and waiting in the room, some were chatting in low voices, all of them were restless and nervous, but they tried to appear otherwise; I could tell their state from the way they kept taking off and putting back on their hats, scratching their heads, changing places, and fiddling with their buttons.</t7640> <t7641>I wasn't comfortable either, but I couldn't take off my hat.</t7641>
<t7642>I wish Aunt Sally had come in right away and finished with me; she could have beaten me if she wanted to, but she should have let me go as soon as possible because I needed to tell Tom how far we had gone and how we had stirred up a hornet's nest. We needed to stop dawdling and get Jim out before these men lost their patience and stormed the cabin.</t7642>
<t7643>Finally, Aunt Sally arrived and started asking me questions, but I couldn't answer her questions properly; my mind was elsewhere because the men were getting quite restless. Some of them wanted to start immediately and finish off the bandits, saying there were only a few minutes left until midnight; others were trying to hold them back and wait for the sheep to bleat. Meanwhile, Aunt Sally was bombarding me with questions like rain.</t7643> <t7644>I started trembling and was scared to death.</t7644> <t7645>Meanwhile, the inside of the house was getting warmer and warmer.</t7645> <t7646>The butter had started to melt, running down my neck and behind my ears.</t7646> <t7647>A little later, when one of the men said, "I say we go to the cabin first, let's go out right now and catch them when we get back," I almost fainted.</t7647> <t7648>At that moment, the melted butter started running down my forehead, and when Aunt Sally saw this, she turned as white as a sheet:</t7648>
<t7649>“For God's sake, what happened to this child!</t7649> <t7650>I'm sure he had brain fever, moreover, his brain started to ooze!</t7650><t7651>”</t7651>
<t7652>Everyone came running, and when Aunt Sally took off my hat, the rest of the bread and butter fell with a plop.</t7652> <t7653>When Aunt Sally saw this, she hugged me and said:</t7653>
<t7654>“Ah, how you scared me!</t7654> <t7655>I am so glad that nothing bad happened, thank God; we have a terrible misfortune over our heads these days.</t7655> <t7656>When I saw what was oozing from your forehead, I almost died of fright, because when I saw its color and consistency, it seemed to me that your brain was leaking...</t7656> <t7657>My dear, why didn't you tell me why you went down to the basement, I wouldn't have been angry with you.</t7657> <t7658>Now go to your bed, I don't want to see you around here again until morning!</t7658><t7659>”</t7659>
<t7660>In one second, I reached the stairs, in the next, I slid down the lightning rod and quickly reached the shed in the dark.</t7660> <t7661>I was so anxious that words barely came out of my mouth, but I quickly explained everything to Tom as best as I could; we had to leave immediately, there wasn't a minute to lose...</t7661> <t7662>The house was filled with men, all of them armed with rifles!</t7662>
<t7663>Tom's eyes sparkled.</t7663>
<t7664>“No way!..</t7664> <t7665>Really?</t7665> <t7666>Isn't it amazing?</t7666> <t7667>If I had the chance to do it again, I could bring two hundred men, Huck! Actually, if I waited a bit longer...</t7667><t7668>”</t7668>
<t7669>"Hurry up!"</t7669> <t7670>"Hurry! I said."</t7670> <t7671>"Where is Jim?"</t7671><t7672>"</t7672>
<t7673>"Right behind your elbow, if you extend your arm, you can touch it.</t7673> <t7674>She put on her dress, everything is ready.</t7674> <t7675>Now let's go outside and you can bleat like a sheep.</t7675><t7676>"</t7676>
<t7677>But at that moment, we heard the men approaching the door, and while they were trying to open the padlock by feel, we heard a man speaking:</t7677>
<t7678>“I told you we came early; they haven't arrived yet…</t7678> <t7679>the door is still locked.</t7679> <t7680>Some of you will be locked inside the cabin and will wait in the dark to kill them when they arrive; the rest should spread out and stay alert.</t7680><t7681>”</t7681>
<t7682>They entered, but they couldn't see us in the dark.</t7682><t7683>They almost stepped on us as we scrambled under the bed.</t7683><t7684>But we got under the bed without anything happening to us, quickly crawled out through the hole – according to Tom's orders, Jim went first, then me, and finally Tom.</t7684><t7685>Now we were inside the storeroom, and we could hear people moving around outside.</t7685><t7686>We crawled towards the door, Tom stopped us and peered through a crack to look outside, but he couldn't see anything, it was too dark; then he turned to us and whispered that he would wait for the footsteps to fade away; when he gave the signal, Jim would go first, and he would go last.</t7686><t7687>This time he put his ear to the crack and listened, listened, listened, but there were always people walking outside; finally, he gave us the signal and we quietly slipped out, not even breathing, moving stealthily towards the fences.</t7687><t7688>We moved in a single file and reached the fence, Jim and I climbed over it, but Tom's pants got caught on a splinter at the top of the fence at the last moment, and we heard someone approaching; then Tom forced the pants and the splinter snapped with a crack; as he started following us, we heard someone shout:</t7688>
<t7689>“Who is there?</t7689> <t7690>Answer; otherwise, I will shoot!</t7690><t7691>”</t7691>
<t7692>But we did not answer, instead, we spread our compasses and started to run away quickly.</t7692> <t7693>There was a commotion behind us, bam, bam, bam! and bullets whizzed around us!</t7693> <t7694>One of them was heard shouting:</t7694>
<t7695>“There they are!</t7695> <t7696>They are heading towards the river!</t7696> <t7697>Follow them, gentlemen!</t7697> <t7698>Release the dogs!</t7698><t7699>”</t7699>
<t7700>They were all coming after us at once.</t7700> <t7701>We could hear them because they had boots on and were shouting, but we didn't have boots, and we weren't shouting.</t7701> <t7702>We were on the road to the mill, and when they got close enough, we dove into the bushes and waited for them to pass, then continued on the road behind them.</t7702> <t7703>They had silenced the dogs so they wouldn't scare off the robbers, but now someone had let them loose, and here they were coming, barking madly, but they were our dogs; so we waited for them to catch up to us, and when they saw us, all their excitement died down; after a few murmurs, they continued barking and running towards the shouting ahead; we started running after them and almost reached the mill, at one point diving into the bushes and getting to where my canoe was tied, we got into the canoe and started paddling towards the middle of the river with all our might, but we were definitely not making more noise than necessary.</t7703> <t7704>We proceeded comfortably towards the island where my raft was hidden; we could hear those behind us shouting and barking on the shore, but then we got quite far away and the sounds gradually faded.</t7704> <t7705>When we got onto the raft, I said:</t7705>
<t7706>"Now you are a free man again, big Jim, and you will never be a slave to anyone again."</t7706><t7707></t7707>
<t7708>"You did a very good job, Huck.</t7708> <t7709>It was a very nice plan, everything went very well; no one else could come up with such a complex and real plan.</t7709><t7710>"</t7710>
<t7711>We were all very content with our situation, but the most content among us was Tom, because he had taken a bullet to his calf.</t7711>
<t7712>When Jim and I heard this, the joy we felt for being saved was short-lived.</t7712> <t7713>He was in a lot of pain and was bleeding; we laid him inside the shelter and tore one of the duke's shirts to bandage his wound.</t7713>
<t7714>“Give me the cloths, I can do it myself,” he said.</t7714> <t7715>“Don’t stop; there’s no point in lingering here any longer, this retreat news will echo everywhere soon; to the helm, untie the rope!</t7715> <t7716>We did a very neat job, kids!..</t7716> <t7717>It was really very neat.</t7717> <t7718>XVI.</t7718> <t7719>If only they had given us the responsibility for Louis XVI’s escape, his biography wouldn’t say, “The son of Saint Louis ascended to heaven!”; no, sir, we would have whisked him across the border in no time…</t7719> <t7720>that’s how we would have made him retreat…</t7720> <t7721>as easily as pulling a hair out of butter.</t7721> <t7722>To the helm…</t7722> <t7723>To the helm!</t7723><t7724>”</t7724>
<t7725>But Jim and I were talking on one hand and thinking on the other.</t7725>
<t7726>“Tell me, Jim,” I said after about a minute.</t7726>
<t7727>He started to speak:</t7727>
<t7728>“Let me tell you this from my own perspective, Huck.</t7728> <t7729>If we had caught Tom and someone got hurt, wouldn't we have said, 'Don't waste time trying to catch me, go find a doctor'?</t7729> <t7730>Is this something Master Tom Sawyer would say?</t7730> <t7731>Would he say such a thing?</t7731> <t7732>He would never say that!</t7732> <t7733>Well then, would Jim say such a thing?</t7733> <t7734>No, master... if a doctor isn't found, I won't take a step from here, even if it takes forty years!</t7734><t7735>”</t7735>
<t7736>I knew deep down that he was white and I had predicted that he would say so – in this situation, there was nothing to be done, so I told Tom that I would go and bring a doctor.</t7736> <t7737>He objected a lot, yelled and screamed, but Jim and I absolutely did not change our minds; upon this, he tried to crawl and untie the raft, but we did not allow that either.</t7737> <t7738>He tried to give us advice – but that didn’t work either.</t7738>
<t7739>When he saw that I was preparing the tea, he called out from where he was lying:</t7739>
<t7740>“Since you say you will go, let me tell you what to do when you reach the town.</t7740> <t7741>When you enter, close the door and immediately blindfold the doctor, then make him swear to take our secret to the grave and leave a pouch of gold in his hand, then take him down to the shore through dark back alleys and deserted roads, put him in a canoe and bring him here by navigating through the islands, search him and if he has chalk in his pocket, take it, and do not give it back until you take him back to the town, otherwise he will mark this raft with chalk to find it later.</t7741> <t7742>They always do this.</t7742><t7743>”</t7743>
<t7744>I walked away, saying I would do exactly as told, and Jim would hide among the trees when he saw the doctor coming, then reappear once he left.</t7744>
<t7745>Chapter Forty-One</t7745>
<t7746>The doctor was an old man; more precisely, he was an extremely polite and chubby old man when I woke him up.</t7746> <t7747>I told him that my brother and I had set up camp on a raft we found while hunting on Spanish Island yesterday afternoon, that he had kicked his rifle in his sleep at midnight, and that the rifle had gone off and shot him in the leg; we wanted him to come and treat my brother and not tell anyone, because we intended to return home this evening and surprise our folks.</t7747>
<t7748>"Who are your people?" he asked.</t7748>
<t7749>“The Phelpses who live down there.</t7749><t7750>”</t7750>
<t7751>“Haa,” he said.</t7751> <t7752>A minute later, he asked, “How did you say he was shot?”</t7752>
<t7753>“He kicked in his dream,” I said, “and the rifle went off.</t7753><t7754>”</t7754>
<t7755>“So, in his dream,” he said.</t7755>
<t7756>He lit his lantern, took his bag, and we set off.</t7756> <t7757>But when he saw the canoe, his face fell – he said that the canoe would be enough for one person, but it didn't look very safe for two.</t7757>
<t7758>"You have nothing to worry about, sir, it carried the three of us comfortably," I said.</t7758>
<t7759>“Three?</t7759><t7760>”</t7760>
<t7761>“Ben, Sid and… and… rifles; I meant rifles.</t7761><t7762>”</t7762>
<t7763>“Haa,” he said.</t7763>
<t7764>But she put her foot on the gunwale and gave the canoe a little test; shaking her head, she said we needed to find a bigger one.</t7764> <t7765>However, all the canoes were locked and chained; so she took my canoe and told me to wait until she returned, suggesting that I could either fish a bit more or go home and prepare our folks for a surprise.</t7765> <t7766>But I said I wouldn't go anywhere, described to her how to find the raft, and she set off.</t7766>
<t7767>Before long, I started to have second thoughts.</t7767> <t7768>What if Tom couldn't finish treating his leg in one go, what if it took three or four days?</t7768> <t7769>What would we do then?</t7769> <t7770>Were we supposed to wait until the doctor raised a fuss?</t7770> <t7771>No sir, I knew exactly what I was going to do.</t7771> <t7772>I would wait, and if he said he needed to come back when he arrived, I would swim after him the second time; then I would trick him, tie him up, and we would take the raft and set off; once Tom was done with him, we would pay him whatever he asked, even give him everything we had in our pockets, and leave him on the shore.</t7772>
<t7773>So, I leaned my back against a pile of wood and fell asleep; when I woke up, the sun had already risen!</t7773> <t7774>I immediately rushed to the doctor's house, but they told me he had gone to see a patient at night and hadn't returned yet.</t7774> <t7775>That means Tom's condition is very bad, I thought, so I should go to the island immediately.</t7775> <t7776>I set off right away and turned the corner, but I almost headbutted Uncle Silas in the stomach!</t7776>
<t7777>“Tom! Where have you been for hours, you rascal?” he said.</t7777>
<t7778>“I was nowhere,” I said, “I was just after that runaway black man...</t7778> <t7779>me and Sid.</t7779><t7780>”</t7780>
<t7781>"So where did you go?" he asked.</t7781> <t7782>"Your aunt was almost going to lose her mind.</t7782><t7783>"</t7783>
<t7784>“There was no need to panic,” I said, “because we are both fine.</t7784> <t7785>We followed the men and the dogs, but they were faster than us, so we lost them after a while; at one point, we thought the sounds were coming from the river, so we got into a canoe and went after them, we went across but saw no one; we tried to come back up the river, but we were exhausted; we tied the canoe somewhere and fell asleep and woke up just an hour ago, then came here to find out what happened, Sid went to the post office thinking someone might have heard something, and I was going to get something to eat, then we were going to come home.</t7785><t7786>”</t7786>
<t7787>Upon this, we went to the post office to find "Sid"; but just as I "suspected", he wasn't there; the old man received a letter from the post office, we waited a bit longer but Sid didn't show up; then the old man suggested that we leave, Sid could walk home or come down by canoe after dawdling enough, but we would go by horse.</t7787> <t7788>He didn't let me stay and wait for Sid; he said it wouldn't be of any use; I had to go with him and tell Aunt Sally that we were both fine.</t7788>
<t7789>Aunt Sally was so pleased to see me when we arrived that she hugged me while both laughing and crying at the same time, then gave me a good spanking, but it almost didn't hurt at all.</t7789> <t7790>She said she would do the same to Sid when he arrived.</t7790>
<t7791>The inside of the house was filled with farmers who had come for dinner and their wives; there was more chatter than I had ever heard in my life.</t7791> <t7792>The worst was old Mrs. Hotchkiss, her tongue never stopped working:</t7792>
<t7793>“I turned that cabin upside down, Brother Phelps, I had no doubt that the Negro was insane.</t7793> <t7794>I was just telling Brother Damrell…</t7794> <t7795>didn't I say so, Brother Damrell?..</t7795> <t7796>I was saying he was truly mad…</t7796> <t7797>I said it exactly like that.</t7797> <t7798>You all heard me: I said he was a lunatic; everything points to it.</t7798> <t7799>Looking at the state of that millstone, no sane creature would write such nonsensical, crazy things on a millstone, I said.</t7799> <t7800>No sir, this man's heart is broken, no sir, he's been there for thirty-seven years…</t7800> <t7801>he was even the son of someone named Louis, and a lot more nonsense.</t7801> <t7802>Look at the trouble of the madman, I realized it from the very beginning, I said the same thing there, and I'm saying it now…</t7802> <t7803>that Negro is a lunatic…</t7803> <t7804>even crazier than Nebuchadnezzar.</t7804><t7805>”</t7805>
<t7806>“That cloth ladder he made, Hotchkiss Brother,” said old Mrs. Damrell, “For God's sake, what could he have made it for?..</t7806><t7807>”</t7807>
<t7808>“I was just telling Brother Utterback the same thing, look, ask him if you want, he will tell you.</t7808> <t7809>I took a look at that rope ladder…</t7809> <t7810>yes, I looked carefully and wondered why he made it.</t7810> <t7811>Ask Mrs. Hotchkiss, she will tell you…</t7811><t7812>”</t7812>
<t7813>“So how did they get that huge millstone in there?</t7813> <t7814>Who dug that hole?</t7814> <t7815>Who…</t7815><t7816>”</t7816>
<t7817>“That's what I said, Brother Penrod! I told you… you went through that hole, didn’t you?..</t7817> <t7818>I was just telling Brother Dunlap that, how did they get that big millstone there, I said.</t7818> <t7819>And without any help… without anyone helping!</t7819> <t7820>That's the issue.</t7820> <t7821>It's obvious that someone from outside helped, and what help it was, at least a dozen people helped that black man, if I were in your place, I would skin every black person here if necessary to find out who helped, in fact, if it were up to me…</t7821><t7822>”</t7822>
<t7823>“You say a dozen!..</t7823> <t7824>To do that much work, at least forty people would be needed.</t7824> <t7825>Look at this saw made from a pocket knife, how meticulously they worked; see how the leg of the bed was cut, that job would take six people a week to finish; didn't you see what they put on the bed made of straw?..</t7825><t7826>”</t7826>
<t7827>“Well, that's right, you said it, Brother Hightower! I was just telling Brother Phelps the same thing.</t7827> <t7828>What do you say, Brother Hotchkiss?</t7828> <t7829>I wonder what Brother Phelps thinks?</t7829> <t7830>When he sees the bedpost cut like that?</t7830> <t7831>Just think about it; that's how I see it, whether you accept it or not; maybe no one will accept it, but still, that's my opinion, if anyone has a better idea, let them come forward and say it.</t7831> <t7832>I told Brother Dunlap...</t7832><t7833>”</t7833>
<t7834>“Oh, goodness gracious, Brother Phelps, for four weeks there were probably a houseful of black people there every night, only just managing to get all that work done.</t7834> <t7835>Look at this shirt…</t7835> <t7836>every inch of it is covered with secret African writings in blood!</t7836> <t7837>It must have been a raft full of black people coming to work.</t7837> <t7838>I'll pay two dollars to have this writing read; as for the black people who wrote it, I know exactly what I'll do to them…</t7838><t7839>”</t7839>
<t7840>“Someone must have been helping them, that's for sure, Brother Marples! If you had been living in this house for a while, you would think the same.</t7840> <t7841>They stole everything they could get their hands on…</t7841> <t7842>Even while we were constantly on watch.</t7842> <t7843>They took that shirt straight from the clothesline!</t7843> <t7844>I can't even remember how many times they stole the sheet they used to make the rope ladder; plus flour, candles, candlesticks, spoons, an old bed warmer, and a thousand other things I can't even think of right now, and now my new calico dress is gone; Silas, Sid, Tom, and I were on watch day and night, I told you, not one of us caught them, we didn't even see or hear them; so at the last minute, you might not believe your ears but they passed right under our noses; they tricked us; and not just us, they tricked the robbers from the Indian Territory too; in fact, they escaped quite comfortably with that black man, even though there were sixteen men and twenty-two dogs behind them!</t7844> <t7845>This beats all the stories I've heard so far.</t7845> <t7846>Ghosts couldn't have done better, couldn't have been more cunning.</t7846> <t7847>Actually, I'm afraid they might be ghosts…</t7847> <t7848>You know our dogs, there's none better; even those dogs couldn't find their tracks!</t7848> <t7849>Someone explain this to me if they can!..</t7849> <t7850>Anyone!</t7850><t7851>”</t7851>
<t7852>“True, there's really no one better...</t7852><t7853>”</t7853>
<t7854>"I have never heard such a thing in my life..."</t7854><t7855>"</t7855>
<t7856>“Then help me, how can it be that...</t7856><t7857>”</t7857>
<t7858>“They have both robbed the house and also...</t7858><t7859>”</t7859>
<t7860>“My Almighty Lord, I would be afraid to live in such a place...</t7860><t7861>”</t7861>
<t7862>“So you were scared!..</t7862> <t7863>I was so scared that I couldn't lie down, I couldn't get up, I couldn't stretch out, I couldn't sit, Brother Ridgeway.</t7863> <t7864>Do you know what they stole…</t7864> <t7865>My God, you can't imagine how panicked I was when I returned to bed in the middle of the night.</t7865> <t7866>Still, thank God, with this courage, they could have stolen a family member too!</t7866> <t7867>I was out of my mind, my mind had stopped working.</t7867> <t7868>Now it sounds very silly, I mean in the daytime; but I say to myself, the poor two children are sleeping all alone in the room upstairs, God is my witness, I was so disturbed that I went upstairs and locked their door!</t7868> <t7869>I really did that.</t7869> <t7870>Anyone would have done the same thing.</t7870> <t7871>Because if a person is scared and the things that scare them continue, even if things are getting worse, they feel like they are losing their mind and start doing ridiculous things; you find yourself putting yourself in a child's place, far away upstairs, and the door is not locked…”</t7871> <t7872>He suddenly stopped, as if something had come to his mind, slowly turned his head, and finally, we made eye contact – I immediately got up and went for a walk.</t7872>
<t7873>This morning I can explain better why we weren't in that room, but first I need to retreat to a corner and think about it, I said to myself.</t7873> <t7874>I moved a little away.</t7874> <t7875>But I didn't go too far, otherwise he might have sent someone after me.</t7875> <t7876>After hours had passed and everyone had left, I went into the house and told Aunt Sally that "Sid" and I woke up to the noise and gunshots at night; the door was locked, we didn't want to miss the fun, so we came down from the lightning rod and got hurt, we would never try such a thing again.</t7876> <t7877>Then I went on to tell Uncle Silas the story I had told him before; upon which he said he forgave us, maybe everything was alright; what could one expect from two boys, as far as he knew, all boys had their heads in the clouds; so, since no one was harmed, it was better to be thankful that we were alive and healthy, still with him, rather than worrying about what had happened before.</t7877> <t7878>He kissed me, patted my head, and after a while, he got lost in thought, but soon he suddenly jumped up:</t7878>
<t7879>“My Almighty Lord, it's almost getting dark, Sid still hasn't come!</t7879> <t7880>Did something happen to the child?</t7880><t7881>”</t7881>
<t7882>I should have taken advantage of this opportunity; I immediately jumped up and said:</t7882>
<t7883>"I'll quickly run to the town and find him."</t7883><t7884>"</t7884>
<t7885>"No way," he said.</t7885> <t7886>"Stay where you are, it's enough that one of you is missing.</t7886> <t7887>If he doesn't come back by dinner, your brother-in-law will go look for him.</t7887><t7888>"</t7888>
<t7889>Tom didn't come to dinner either, so after the meal, my brother-in-law went to check on him.</t7889>
<t7890>She came back around ten o'clock, a little worried, having not encountered Tom anywhere.</t7890> <t7891>Aunt Sally was now quite anxious; but Uncle Silas said it was nothing important...</t7891> <t7892>"He's just a child, after all," he said, "you'll see, he'll turn up safe and sound in the morning." Aunt Sally had to be content with this.</t7892> <t7893>But she said she would stay up for a while and keep the light on, as she wanted to see him if he came back.</t7893>
<t7894>Then, as I was going to bed, she took her candlestick and went upstairs with me, tucked me in, and mothered me so well that I began to wish the ground would swallow me up; I was too ashamed to even look at her face. She sat on the edge of the bed and talked to me for a long time, telling me how extraordinary a child Sid was, as if she never wanted to stop talking about him. From time to time, she asked me questions, wondering if he was lost, injured, or even drowned. She was worried that he might be suffering somewhere or lying lifeless, and tears streamed down her face because she couldn't be there to help him.</t7894> <t7895>I told her that Sid was fine and that he would definitely come home in the morning; then she squeezed my hand, even kissed my cheek, and asked me to say it again, to keep saying it, because it made her feel better and she was very worried.</t7895> <t7896>As she was leaving, she looked straight into my eyes and said in a very calm and sweet voice:</t7896>
<t7897>"The door will not be locked, Tom; besides, there is the window and the lightning rod; but you will behave, won't you?</t7897> <t7898>You won't go, will you?</t7898> <t7899>For my sake?</t7899><t7900>"</t7900>
<t7901>God knows, I was dying to go, I was worried about Tom's situation, I was ready to leave immediately, but after he said those things, I couldn't go even if they took my life.</t7901>
<t7902>If Aunt Sally was on my mind, so was Tom; that's why I couldn't sleep at all.</t7902> <t7903>Twice I climbed down the lightning rod, wandered around the front in the dark of the night, and saw Aunt Sally waiting by the candlestick at the window, her eyes fixed on the road, shedding tears; I wished I could do something for her, but I couldn't, the only thing I could do was to swear that I would never do anything to upset her again.</t7903> <t7904>On the third time, I woke up at dawn and went down.</t7904> <t7905>She was still there, the candle in her candlestick was almost out, and her gray-haired old head had fallen onto her arms, she had fallen asleep.</t7905>
<t7906>Chapter Forty-Two</t7906>
<t7907>The old man went to town again before breakfast, but once again he couldn't find any trace of Tom; now both of them were sitting at the table, lost in deep thought, not uttering a word and looking very sorrowful; their coffee was getting cold, and they weren't eating anything.</t7907> <t7908>After a while, the old man said:</t7908>
<t7909>“Did I give you the letter?</t7909><t7910>”</t7910>
<t7911>“What letter?”</t7911><t7912>”</t7912>
<t7913>“The letter I got from the post office yesterday.</t7913><t7914>”</t7914>
<t7915>“You didn't give me a letter.</t7915><t7916>”</t7916>
<t7917>“So, I must have forgotten.”</t7917><t7918>”</t7918>
<t7919>The old man searched his pockets, then got up and looked for the place where he had put the letter, finally found it, and gave it to him.</t7919>
<t7920>“Ah, from St.</t7920> <t7921>Petersburg...</t7921> <t7922>From my sister...</t7922><t7923>”</t7923>
<t7924>It would have been good to go for a new walk, but I couldn't move from my place.</t7924> <t7925>Fortunately, Aunt Sally dropped the letter just as she was about to open it and started running – because she had seen something.</t7925> <t7926>I saw the same thing.</t7926> <t7927>Tom Sawyer was on a bed; that old doctor was beside him; Jim was standing behind them with his hands tied, wearing a calico dress; and there were many other people as well.</t7927> <t7928>I hid the letter in the first suitable place and dashed outside.</t7928>
<t7929>Aunt Sally collapsed onto Tom, crying.</t7929>
<t7930>“Ah, he left, he left.</t7930> <t7931>He left us!</t7931><t7932>”</t7932>
<t7933>Tom turned his head slightly and muttered something, apparently not in his right mind, then Aunt Sally raised her arms:</t7933>
<t7934>"He's alive; thank God! This is enough for me now!" She planted a kiss on Tom's cheek and hurriedly went home to prepare the bed, all the while rapidly giving orders to the black people and everyone else around her as best as she could.</t7934>
<t7935>I followed the men to see what they would do to Jim; the old doctor and Uncle Silas also went into the house after Tom.</t7935> <t7936>The men were very aggressive and some wanted to hang Jim, so that he would be an example to the other negroes living there, and they wouldn't try to escape like Jim, causing a lot of trouble, terrifying a whole family for days and nights.</t7936> <t7937>But others didn't want to hang him; it wasn't a solution, after all, he wasn't our negro and his owner could come and demand money for the negro.</t7937> <t7938>Upon this, the men calmed down a bit, because those who are most eager to hang negroes who want to do something wrong are always the least willing to pay the money after dealing with him.</t7938>
<t7939>Nevertheless, they cursed and swore at Jim, hit him a few times, but Jim didn't utter a word, nor did he show any sign of knowing me. They took him to the same cabin, dressed him in his own clothes, and chained him again, this time not to the bedpost but to a large ring attached to a log. They chained his hands and feet as well. From then on, until his owner came or he was sold at auction, he would be given nothing but bread and water.</t7939> <t7940>They closed the hole we had opened.</t7940> <t7941>Additionally, every night, a few armed farmers would stand guard around the cabin, and during the day, a guard dog would be tied to the door. They had almost finished their work and were leaving with final curses when the old doctor came in, took a look, and said:</t7941>
<t7942>“Do not treat him badly for no reason, because he is not a bad negro.</t7942> <t7943>When I found the child, I realized I couldn't remove the bullet without help, but the child was in such bad shape that he couldn't be left alone to find help; his condition was gradually worsening, and after a considerable amount of time, he lost consciousness and wouldn't let me approach him anymore, saying he would kill me if I chalked the raft, he babbled such nonsense for a long time that I thought I couldn't be of any help to him; so, I said I needed to find help somehow; as soon as I said this, that negro suddenly appeared and said he would help, and indeed, he helped very well.</t7943> <t7944>Of course, I realized he was a runaway negro, but what could I do?</t7944> <t7945>Moreover, I had to wait there all day and night.</t7945> <t7946>I thought I was in trouble!</t7946> <t7947>I had a few patients with colds, I wanted to go back to town to see them too, but I couldn't go, then the negro would escape and I would be blamed; besides, no boats were passing by nearby.</t7947> <t7948>I stayed on the raft until dawn this morning, and I must say I have never seen a negro take such good care of a patient, so faithfully, he risked his freedom to help me, moreover, he could barely lift his arm, it was clear he had been worked very hard recently.</t7948> <t7949>I was very pleased with the negro's behavior; such a negro is worth a thousand dollars, gentlemen…</t7949> <t7950>He also deserves to be treated well.</t7950> <t7951>He found everything I needed, and made the child as comfortable as if he were at home…</t7951> <t7952>Maybe even more comfortable, since it was very quiet around; but I was in a bad state, both of them were on my mind; I had to wait there until this morning; then a boat approached and by chance, the negro was sitting at the helm with his head between his knees, sleeping; I signaled to the people on the boat to approach quietly, before the negro knew what was happening, they grabbed him tightly and tied his hands and feet, there was no trouble at all.</t7952> <t7953>The child was also sleeping, we tied the raft to the boat and quietly pulled it to a safe place; meanwhile, the negro didn't make any fuss from the beginning, he didn't even say a word.</t7953> <t7954>He is not a bad negro, gentlemen; that is my opinion.</t7954><t7955>”</t7955>
<t7956>"By God, it sounds good, doctor," said someone.</t7956>
<t7957>Then the others softened a bit too; I was grateful to the old doctor for doing this kindness for Jim, and I was also very pleased that I was not mistaken about him; from the very beginning, from the moment I first saw him, I had thought he was a kind-hearted man.</t7957> <t7958>Then they all decided that Jim had behaved very well and therefore deserved better treatment; he should be rewarded for his kindness.</t7958> <t7959>They each sincerely swore that they would never curse at him again.</t7959>
<t7960>Then they went outside and locked the door behind them.</t7960> <t7961>I had hoped they would remove some of my chains because they were very heavy, or maybe they would give meat and vegetables along with bread and water, but it never crossed their minds.</t7961> <t7962>I thought it best not to get involved in this matter, but I had to relay what the doctor said to Aunt Sally, of course, I would do this as soon as I got past the massive waves rising right in front of me.</t7962> <t7963>That is, as soon as I made the explanations, because they would want to know why I forgot to tell how Sid was shot while we were going by canoe that night to find the runaway slave.</t7963>
<t7964>But I had plenty of time.</t7964> <t7965>Aunt Sally spent the whole day and night in the sick room; and whenever I noticed Uncle Silas looking around, I would disappear.</t7965>
<t7966>I heard the next morning that Tom was much better, and they said Aunt Sally had gone to get some sleep.</t7966> <t7967>I sneaked into the sickroom, thinking that if I found Tom awake, we could come up with a story to fool the whole family.</t7967> <t7968>But he was sleeping, and he was sleeping peacefully; his face was pale, not flushed like when he arrived.</t7968> <t7969>So I sat down and waited for him to wake up.</t7969> <t7970>About half an hour later, Aunt Sally quietly slipped in, and there she had caught me again!</t7970> <t7971>She signaled me to be quiet and sat down next to me, then started whispering.</t7971> <t7972>We could all be happy now because Tom was doing very well, and he had been sleeping like this for a long time, looking healthier and more peaceful by the minute; he would probably wake up soon, feeling much better.</t7972>
<t7973>Upon this, we sat down and began to watch it; it slowly started to move, then naturally opened its eyes, and looked around:</t7973>
<t7974>“Hello! But I'm at home! How did this happen?</t7974> <t7975>Where is Sal?</t7975><t7976>”</t7976>
<t7977>"In very good condition," I said.</t7977>
<t7978>“What about Jim?</t7978><t7979>”</t7979>
<t7980>“The same,” I said, but I had said it a bit hesitantly.</t7980> <t7981>He didn't notice at all:</t7981>
<t7982>“Very good!</t7982> <t7983>Wonderful! Now we are all safe and sound!</t7983> <t7984>Did you tell my aunt?</t7984><t7985>”</t7985>
<t7986>I was just about to say yes when Aunt Sally interrupted:</t7986>
<t7987>"What was he going to say, Sid?"</t7987>
<t7988>“How did we accomplish this great task?</t7988><t7989>”</t7989>
<t7990>“Which big task?</t7990><t7991>”</t7991>
<t7992>“Big deal.</t7992> <t7993>It's not just one thing, first of all, how we saved the runaway black man…</t7993> <t7994>me and Tom.</t7994><t7995>”</t7995>
<t7996>"My Almighty Lord! Save? </t7996> <t7997>What is this child talking about!</t7997> <t7998>For God's sake, he lost himself again!</t7998><t7999>"</t7999>
<t8000>"No, I haven't lost myself; I know exactly what I'm saying.</t8000> <t8001>We saved him...</t8001> <t8002>me and Tom.</t8002> <t8003>We planned for a long time and finally succeeded.</t8003> <t8004>And in a very stylish way." Tom was excited, Aunt Sally no longer stopped him, she just sat and watched his speech with a stern look, I realized there was no point in interrupting.</t8004> <t8005>"You can't imagine how hard we worked, Aunt...</t8005> <t8006>We struggled for weeks...</t8006> <t8007>Every night while you were sleeping, we worked for hours.</t8007> <t8008>We had to steal the candles, the sheet, the shirt, and your dress, the spoons, the tin plates, the knives, the bed warmer, the millstone, the flour, and many other things; you would be amazed at how long it took to prepare the saw, the pens, the inscriptions, and other things, and you could never guess how much fun it was.</t8008> <t8009>We made coffin pictures and sent anonymous letters from robbers, constantly went up and down the lightning rod, made that hole in the cabin, made a rope ladder and sent it inside a pie, put the spoons and such in your apron pocket...</t8009><t8010>"</t8010>
<t8011>“For God's sake!</t8011><t8012>”</t8012>
<t8013>“… also, we filled the cabin with mice, snakes, and such to accompany Jim; then you kept Tom here with butter on his hat for so long that you almost ruined everything, because before we could get out, the men came to the cabin, we had to hurry, they heard our voices and shot at us, I got hit, we went off the road while escaping, and they passed us; when the dogs came, they didn't do anything to us, they followed the noise, we jumped into our canoe and reached the raft, we were safe now, and Jim was free, we did it all by ourselves, isn't it wonderful, Aunt!”</t8013><t8014>”</t8014>
<t8015>“If I've ever heard such a thing in my life, may I be damned!</t8015> <t8016>So it was you, you little rascals, you caused all those troubles, you drove everyone out of their minds, you scared us to death.</t8016> <t8017>Now I feel like giving you a good beating.</t8017> <t8018>When I think about what I went through here night after night...</t8018> <t8019>oh, just wait until you get better, you brat, then I'll skin both of you alive!</t8019><t8020>”</t8020>
<t8021>Aunt Polly was so proud and cheerful that she couldn't contain herself and kept on talking – Aunt Sally was also fuming now and then, and they were both talking at the same time like a chorus of cats.</t8021> <t8022>Aunt Sally said at one point:</t8022>
<t8023>"Well, for now, enjoy yourself as much as you want because if I catch you around him again..."</t8023><t8024>"</t8024>
<t8025>"Around whom?" Tom's smile suddenly froze, he was very surprised.</t8025>
<t8026>“Who?</t8026> <t8027>The runaway black man, of course?</t8027> <t8028>Who did you think?</t8028><t8029>”</t8029>
<t8030>Tom's face suddenly clouded over and he turned to me.</t8030>
<t8031>“Tom, didn't you just tell me that he was fine?</t8031> <t8032>Hadn't he escaped?</t8032><t8033>”</t8033>
<t8034>“Is it him?” said Aunt Sally; “The runaway black man?</t8034> <t8035>He didn't escape at all.</t8035> <t8036>They caught him tight and brought him back, put him in his cabin again, only give him bread and water, and chained him from all sides; he will stay that way until his owner comes or he is sold!</t8036><t8037>”</t8037>
<t8038>Tom sat up in his bed with sparks flying from his eyes, his nostrils flaring like gills, and shouted in anger:</t8038>
<t8039>"They have no right to shut it down!</t8039> <t8040>They have no right to push it around at all!..</t8040> <t8041>Don't waste a single minute.</t8041> <t8042>Set it free!</t8042> <t8043>It is not a slave, it is as free as everyone living in this world!</t8043><t8044>"</t8044>
<t8045>“What is this child trying to say?</t8045><t8046>”</t8046>
<t8047>"I mean everything I said, Aunt Sally, if no one goes and frees him, I will go myself.</t8047> <t8048>I've known him since I can remember, and Tom knows him too.</t8048> <t8049>Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was so ashamed of thinking about selling him down the river that she freed him in her will.</t8049><t8050>"</t8050>
<t8051>“Alright, but why were you trying to save him, my child?</t8051> <t8052>He was already free!</t8052><t8053>”</t8053>
<t8054>“This is exactly the kind of question a woman would ask!</t8054> <t8055>Of course, I saved it for the adventure.</t8055> <t8056>I was even willing to risk drowning in my own blood for this.</t8056> <t8057>Oh my God, Aunt Polly!</t8057><t8058>”</t8058>
<t8059>Indeed, Aunt Polly was there, standing like an angel in front of the door with her usual sweet cheeks and kind face, looking at us.</t8059>
<t8060>Aunt Sally immediately rushed towards him, hugged him around the neck, and started crying, and in the meantime, I slipped under the bed because things were starting to get heated for us.</t8060> <t8061>When I looked surreptitiously, I saw that Tom's Aunt Polly had freed herself from her sister's arms and was looking at Tom over her glasses – as if she was going to bury him into the ground.</t8061> <t8062>Then she said:</t8062>
<t8063>“You'd really do well to turn your head...</t8063> <t8064>If I were you, I'd do the same, Tom.</t8064><t8065>”</t8065>
<t8066>“Oh my God!” said Aunt Sally, “Has he changed that much?</t8066> <t8067>This isn't Tom, Sid; Tom is…</t8067> <t8068>Tom is…</t8068> <t8069>Where did Tom go now?</t8069> <t8070>He was here a second ago.</t8070><t8071>”</t8071>
<t8072>“I suppose you mean where Huck Finn is…</t8072> <t8073>because you are talking about him!</t8073> <t8074>After raising and growing up a rascal like Tom, I would certainly recognize him when I see him.</t8074> <t8075>It would indeed be very strange.</t8075> <t8076>Come out from under the bed, Huck Finn.</t8076><t8077>”</t8077>
<t8078>I came out from under the bed, feeling shy and embarrassed.</t8078>
<t8079>I had never seen a person as bewildered as Aunt Sally before, but then I did: When Uncle Silas, to whom they were telling the story, came in, his state was even more dire.</t8079> <t8080>He was practically dead drunk, wandered around in a daze for the rest of the day, and became incredibly famous because of the sermon he gave that night, as even the oldest folks couldn't understand a single word he said.</t8080> <t8081>Thus, Tom's Aunt Polly explained everything about who I was and what I had done, and then I tried to explain how difficult it was for me when Mrs. Phelps thought I was Tom Sawyer – but she interrupted me: "Oh, alright, just call me Aunt Sally again, I'm already used to it, no need to say anything else – I had to accept my fate when Aunt Sally mistook me for Tom Sawyer – there was no other way, besides, I knew Tom wouldn't object, because he loved such things, he liked mysterious affairs, would immediately turn them into an adventure, and then he would be happy.</t8081> <t8082>So, he accepted being Sid and tried to make things easier for me.</t8082>
<t8083>Aunt Polly confirmed what Tom had said about Mrs. Watson's will freeing Jim; so our Tom Sawyer had indeed gone through all that trouble to rescue a free black man!</t8083> <t8084>Until that moment when the conversation took place, I hadn't understood how someone as well-bred as him could have freed a black man.</t8084>
<t8085>Anyway, Aunt Polly said to herself this time when she received Aunt Sally's letter confirming that Tom and Sid had arrived safely:</t8085>
<t8086>"Here comes trouble!</t8086> <t8087>What else could happen if I let him wander all that way without anyone to watch over him?</t8087> <t8088>Well then, now go down the river for eleven hundred miles and find out what our rascal is up to this time if you have nothing better to do; and on top of that, I keep sending letters to my brother but he never replies.</t8088><t8089>"</t8089>
<t8090>“But I haven't seen any of your letters,” said Aunt Sally.</t8090>
<t8091>“Yeah, I wonder why!</t8091> <t8092>I wrote to you twice and asked what you meant by saying Sid was there.</t8092><t8093>”</t8093>
<t8094>"No, I didn't receive any letter, sister.</t8094><t8095>"</t8095>
<t8096>Aunt Polly slowly turned to Tom with a stern expression on her face.</t8096>
<t8097>"Tom, you did it!"</t8097><t8098>"</t8098>
<t8099>“What have I done?” Tom asked meekly.</t8099>
<t8100>“Don't tell me what I've done, you shameless one, you...</t8100> <t8101>Take out the letters, let's see.</t8101><t8102>”</t8102>
<t8103>"Which letters?"</t8103>
<t8104>“Those letters.</t8104> <t8105>If you don't give them to me right away, if I have to find them myself, then...</t8105><t8106>”</t8106>
<t8107>"The letters are in the chest.</t8107> <t8108>Yes, there.</t8108> <t8109>I definitely didn't touch them, they are just as I received them from the post office.</t8109> <t8110>I didn't open or even touch them.</t8110> <t8111>But I knew the letters would cause trouble, and I thought you weren't in a hurry...</t8111><t8112>"</t8112>
<t8113>"You're itching to skin me alive, huh? I have no doubt about that anymore.</t8113> <t8114>Also, I had sent another letter informing you that I would come here, and I believe Tom...</t8114><t8115>"</t8115>
<t8116>"No, it arrived yesterday; I haven't read it yet, but there's no problem.</t8116> <t8117>It's with me.</t8117><t8118>"</t8118>
<t8119>I would bet two dollars that the letter is not with Aunt Sally, but it seemed wiser to keep quiet at that moment.</t8119> <t8120>I didn't say anything.</t8120>
<t8121>Final Chapter</t8121>
<t8122>When I first caught Tom alone, I asked him what idea he had in mind during the escape.</t8122> <t8123>What he was thinking of doing if the escape went smoothly and we managed to free a slave who was already free.</t8123> <t8124>Upon this, he told me the plan that had been in his mind from the beginning: If we could save Jim, we would go down the river on the raft together, have many adventures until we reached the mouth of the river, then we would tell Jim he was free, give him a comfortable journey home on a steamboat, give him money for the time he lost, inform all the blacks in the village beforehand, and they would take Jim to the village with a band and a torchlight procession; thus Jim would be a hero, and so would we.</t8124> <t8125>But the point where things had come now was just as good.</t8125>
<t8126>We had immediately freed Jim from his chains, and then Aunt Polly, Uncle Silas, and Aunt Sally, having learned how much the doctor had helped treat Tom, had made him their favorite, fulfilled his every wish, never let him lack for anything, and moreover, had given him no work to do.</t8126> <t8127>We brought him to Tom's room and had many conversations, and Tom, because he had endured imprisonment for our sake with great patience and had been very successful, gave Jim forty dollars.</t8127> <t8128>Jim was almost going to lose his mind from joy:</t8128>
<t8129>“Ha, see, Huck, what did I tell you?</t8129> <t8130>What did I tell you on Jackson Island?</t8130> <t8131>I told you my chest was hairy, so what was that a sign of?</t8131> <t8132>I had told you once that I was rich, and I said I would be rich again.</t8132> <t8133>And it came true!</t8133> <t8134>Oh boy!</t8134> <t8135>I trust in omens, I never doubt the truth of omens.</t8135> <t8136>Just as I know I am alive right now, I knew for sure that I would be rich again!</t8136><t8137>”</t8137>
<t8138>Then Tom started talking, and after a long conversation, he said, "Let's all sneak out of here within a few nights, disguise ourselves, and have some amazing adventures in the Indian Territory for a few weeks."</t8138> <t8139>I said, "Alright, that's fine with me."</t8139> <t8140>But I didn't have any money to buy clothes, and when I got home, I wouldn't have any money either; because my father had probably already returned to the village, taken all the money from Judge Thatcher, and spent it on liquor.</t8140>
<t8141>“It’s not like that at all,” said Tom.</t8141> <t8142>“All your money is there…</t8142> <t8143>Six thousand dollars, maybe even more.</t8143> <t8144>Your father hasn’t been seen since he went out looking for you.</t8144> <t8145>In fact, when I set out for here, he was nowhere to be found.</t8145><t8146>”</t8146>
<t8147>Jim joined the conversation a bit sadly:</t8147>
<t8148>“Dad will never come back again, Huck.</t8148><t8149>”</t8149>
<t8150>“Why, Jim?</t8150><t8151>”</t8151>
<t8152>“Never mind the reason, Huck, but I know it won't happen again.</t8152><t8153>”</t8153>
<t8154>But I wasn't satisfied with this, and when I pressed him further, he confessed:</t8154>
<t8155>“Don't you remember that house going down?</t8155> <t8156>You know, during the flood.</t8156> <t8157>There was a man inside the house, but his face wasn't visible; then I went inside, saw the man's face, but I didn't let you go inside.</t8157> <t8158>That's why you can go and get your money whenever you want, because that man was your father.</t8158><t8159>”</t8159>
<t8160>Tom is quite well now, and he put the bullet in a pocket watch case and hung it around his neck.</t8160> <t8161>He keeps looking at it frequently as if it were a watch.</t8161>
<t8162>So that's how it is, there's nothing left to write about, and I'm very pleased with that.</t8162> <t8163>If I had known that writing this book would be this difficult, I would never have started, and if I ever undertake such a task again, may I be damned.</t8163> <t8164>But I guess it's time for me to quietly slip away to the Indian Territory, because Aunt Sally is thinking of adopting me and then making a man out of me; I can't bear that.</t8164> <t8165>I've tried that before.</t8165>
