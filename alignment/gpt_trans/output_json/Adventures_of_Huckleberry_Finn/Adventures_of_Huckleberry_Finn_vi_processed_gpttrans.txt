<t0>Chapter I</t0>
<t1>Perhaps you won't know me if you haven't read the book called "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"; but that's alright.</t1> <t2>The author of that book is Mr. Mark Twain, and in it, he mostly tells the truth.</t2> <t3>There are some parts where he exaggerates a bit, but the majority of the stories are true.</t3> <t4>I've never seen anyone lie repeatedly like Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe even Mary. Aunt Polly is Tom's aunt, then there's Mary, and the widow Douglas; all of these people appear in the aforementioned book, and, as I said, it is mostly a true book, except for a few slight exaggerations.</t4>
<t5>The book has the following content: Tom and I, one day, stumbled upon a stash of money hidden by robbers in a secret cellar, and suddenly we became very rich.</t5> <t6>Divided up, each of us got as much as six thousand dollars, all in gold.</t6> <t7>Piling up that amount of gold was quite intimidating.</t7> <t8>Then Judge Thatcher immediately took our money and lent it out at interest: as for us, every few days he gave each of us a dollar, and it went on like that all year round.</t8> <t9>Widow Douglas treated me as if I were her own son, and she took it upon herself to civilize me.</t9> <t10>But I thought living around in that house was miserable, because I had to force myself to comply with all her rules and regulations.</t10> <t11>So, when I couldn't stand it anymore, I had to figure out a way to escape.</t11>
<t12>I put on my old, tattered clothes again, and took my jar of candy with me, so I set off and was free and happy once more.</t12> <t13>But somehow Tom Sawyer tracked me down and said that he was about to form a gang of robbers and could let me join, but now he advised me to go back to the widow and behave well first.</t13> <t14>So I went back again.</t14>
<t15>The widow saw me return and burst into tears, she told me I was a poor lost bird, then called me by all sorts of strange names, but she really didn't mean any harm.</t15> <t16>She made me wear new clothes, the kind that made me sweat and feel like I was being tied up.</t16> <t17>Well, the old scenes in this house started to repeat themselves.</t17> <t18>The widow rang the bell to call for dinner, and you had to make sure to be on time.</t18> <t19>Even after sitting at the table, you couldn't eat right away, you had to wait for her to arrive and ramble on about the dishes, which really weren't worth talking about.</t19> <t20>Because the food was always the same, just leftovers mixed together and poured around some kind of sauce.</t20>
<t21>After eating and drinking, she taught me about Moses...</t21> <t22>I thought hard but still couldn't understand who Moses was; but gradually I came to understand that Moses had been dead for a very long time.</t22> <t23>So I gave up, not bothering to care about Moses anymore, because why should I be interested in stories about dead people?</t23>
<t24>Later, when I wanted to smoke, I asked the widow for permission to smoke.</t24><t25>She absolutely refused.</t25><t26>She said it was a bad habit and not clean, and she tried hard to persuade me to quit smoking.</t26><t27>There are people like that, they get involved in things they know nothing about.</t27><t28>Just like she worried about Moses, who wasn't related to her and didn't benefit anyone, since Moses had been dead for ages. Yet she still tried to make me learn from him, thinking it was very good.</t28><t29>But she herself smoked, of course she thought it was fine, because she was the one smoking.</t29><t30>Her sister, Miss Watson, was an old lady, quite thin, with white glasses, who had just come to live in the house with the widow.</t30><t31>Now it was Miss Watson's turn to trouble me with the spelling book.</t31><t32>She taught me with great effort, and every hour the widow would give her a break, and I couldn't endure it any longer.</t32><t33>During that hour, I was bored to death and couldn't sit still.</t33><t34>Miss Watson would constantly say: Huck, don't prop your feet up like that, then: Huck, don't twist around like that, sit up straight, or: Huck, don't yawn and stretch like that, why don't you sit properly?</t34><t35>Then she said that I would end up in miserable places.</t35><t36>I said that I wanted that, and she got really mad.</t36><t37>But I really didn't mean to tease her.</t37><t38>I just wanted to go somewhere, I just wanted a change, I didn't ask for anything special.</t38><t39>She said my words were nonsense, she just wanted to live in a way that would lead to a good place.</t39><t40>But I thought her way wasn't good, so I didn't care.</t40><t41>But I didn't say it out loud, because I was afraid it would cause more trouble.</t41><t42>She said that going to that place, people would spend all day wandering around singing.</t42><t43>I didn't care about that either, but I didn't bother to say it.</t43><t44>I asked her if Tom Sawyer could go to that good place, and she said he couldn't.</t44><t45>Hearing that made me happy, because I wanted the two of us to stay together, not go anywhere.</t45>
<t46>Miss Watson kept pestering me like that, it was really annoying, but right after that, they called the black servants in, and everyone prayed and then went to bed.</t46> <t47>I also returned to my room, carrying a candle to place on the table.</t47> <t48>I plopped down on the chair by the window, trying to think of something fun, but I couldn't think of anything.</t48> <t49>At that moment, I felt so lonely and wished that I could just die.</t49> <t50>In the sky, the stars were twinkling.</t50> <t51>The sound of rustling leaves in the forest was incredibly mournful.</t51> <t52>I heard the distant hoot of an owl as if it were calling out to someone who had passed away, then the cry of a forest bird or a dog howling about someone who was about to die, and the wind seemed to whisper something to me that I couldn't figure out what it was trying to say.</t52> <t53>Thinking that, I shivered and felt a chill run through my body.</t53> <t54>Then after a while, from the distant forest came a sound like a ghost trying to express its worries but couldn't make anyone understand; it seemed like it couldn't rest peacefully in its grave and had to wander mournfully every night like that.</t54> <t55>Thinking that made me even more terrified, and at that moment, I wished there was someone sitting next to me.</t55> <t56>Suddenly, a spider jumped onto my shoulder from somewhere, crawling on my shirt, I quickly flicked it off with my hand, and it shot straight into the burning candle, and before I could pull it out, it was dead.</t56> <t57>At that moment, I didn't need anyone to tell me that it was a bad omen and that I would face misfortune, I was already very scared and frantically shook my clothes.</t57> <t58>I jumped up, spun around three or four times, and then made the sign of the cross many times.</t58> <t59>Then I took a string and tied up my hair to make a charm to ward off evil spirits.</t59> <t60>But then I didn't believe it either.</t60> <t61>This was the custom when someone lost something, after finding it, they were supposed to tie a bow at the front door; but I had never heard anyone say that doing so would prevent bad luck after killing a spider.</t61>
<t62>I sat down on the chair again, feeling restless and uneasy.</t62> <t63>I took out a cigarette to smoke, because by now the house was as silent as death, and the widow had no idea what was going on.</t63> <t64>Then after a while, quite a long time, I heard the distant clock chime - bong - bong - bong, striking twelve times, and then everything was quieter than ever.</t64> <t65>After a moment, I suddenly heard the sound of a dry branch breaking in the dark bushes - it seemed like something was moving.</t65> <t66>I sat silently and immediately heard clearly the sound of a meow coming from that direction.</t66> <t67>Great! I softly responded with a meow, then extinguished the candle, climbed out the window, headed towards the darkness, quickly slid down to the ground, and slipped into the bushes.</t67> <t68>It was indeed Tom Sawyer waiting for me there.</t68>
<t69>Chapter II</t69>
<t70>The two of us tiptoed along the small path under the trees at the corner of the widow's garden, and had to bend down to avoid hitting our heads on the branches.</t70> <t71>When passing by the kitchen door, I tripped over a tree root, making a noise.</t71> <t72>The two of us quickly lay flat on the ground, completely silent.</t72> <t73>The big black man working for Miss Watson, named Jim, was sitting at the kitchen door at that moment.</t73> <t74>We could see Jim very clearly because there was a light behind him.</t74> <t75>Hearing the noise, Jim jumped up, stuck his head out to listen for a while, then asked:</t75>
<t76>- Who is it?</t76>
<t77>Listening for a while and hearing nothing, he tiptoed down and stood right between the two of us.</t77> <t78>Just by reaching out, we could touch him.</t78> <t79>For a long time, it seemed like several minutes passed without a single sound, and the three of us were right next to each other like that.</t79> <t80>At that moment, my ankle felt itchy, then my back, right between my shoulder blades.</t80> <t81>It felt like if I couldn't scratch it at that moment, I would die.</t81> <t82>Right then, Jim spoke up:</t82>
<t83>- Hey, where are you?</t83> <t84>Strange, I clearly heard some noise here.</t84> <t85>Alright, I have a plan. I'll just sit here until I hear the noise again.</t85>
<t86>After saying that, he plopped right down on the ground, between me and Tom. He leaned his back against the tree trunk, stretched out his legs, and almost touched me with his feet.</t86> <t87>My nose started to itch again.</t87> <t88>That torment lasted for six or seven minutes and seemed even longer.</t88> <t89>Now, I felt itchy in a total of eleven places on my body.</t89> <t90>I thought I couldn't endure it for another minute, but I gritted my teeth and prepared to bear it.</t90> <t91>Just then, I heard Jim panting, followed by his snoring.</t91> <t92>Immediately, I felt relieved.</t92>
<t93>Tom signaled to me and I responded by quietly clearing my throat.</t93> <t94>The two of us crawled away again.</t94> <t95>About ten steps away from there, Tom whispered in my ear that he wanted to tie Jim to a tree for fun, but I told him not to, in case Jim woke up and made a fuss, then the people in the house would know I wasn't there.</t95> <t96>Tom then said that there were no candles, and he wanted to sneak into the kitchen to get some.</t96> <t97>I didn't want him to do that, I told him that if Jim woke up and ran in, what would we do then.</t97> <t98>But Tom was determined to take the risk; so we sneaked in and grabbed three candles, then Tom left five cents on the table to pay for them.</t98> <t99>Then we stepped out, I was anxious to run away immediately, but for some reason, Tom crawled back to where Jim was, and I saw him bending over as if he was messing with something above Jim's head. I had to wait for quite a while.</t99> <t100>Everything around was still and quiet.</t100>
<t101>Waiting for Tom to return, we ran along the small path around the garden fence, then after a while ran up the hill on the other side of the house.</t101> <t102>Tom said he had lifted the hat off Jim's head and hung it on a branch right above where he was sleeping; Jim stirred a bit but did not wake up.</t102> <t103>Later on, Jim himself spread the story that a ghost had taken his soul, led him wandering all over the place, and another time he recounted this story, Jim said that the ghost had led him down to New Orleans.</t103> <t104>Another time, each time he retold this story, he added a bit more, gradually until he said that the ghost had taken him all over the world, making him nearly dead tired, and his back was swollen all over.</t104> <t105>Jim was very proud of this story, which made him pay less attention to the other black folks.</t105> <t106>People would travel five or six miles to hear Jim retell this ghost story, gradually in the area, Jim became more respected than the others.</t106> <t107>Black folks from afar would gape at Jim all over, considering him a wonder.</t107> <t108>Black folks often waited until night, sitting by the fire talking about ghosts and spirits; whenever someone started talking about such things and acted like they knew all about ghosts, suddenly Jim would show up and say: Huh!</t108> <t109>What do you know about ghosts? And the other person would immediately fall silent and move to the back to make room for him.</t109> <t110>Jim always had two five-cent coins tied to a string around his neck, boasting that it was a charm given to him by spirits themselves, telling him that he could use it to heal people; and that he could summon ghosts anytime, just by whispering a few words to the coins.</t110> <t111>But he never told anyone what he would say to the charm.</t111> <t112>Black folks in the area would bring anything to Jim just to see those five-cent coins.</t112> <t113>But no one dared to touch them because they feared the spirits' hands had been on them.</t113> <t114>It was truly dangerous for Jim, being a servant, to boast about having met spirits and being led around by ghosts everywhere.</t114>
<t115>When Tom and I reached the hillside, looking towards the hill, we saw three or four flickering fires; perhaps someone there was ill.</t115> <t116>The late-night stars above us were still twinkling beautifully. Down there, near the village, was a river almost a mile wide, silently flowing in a terrifying manner.</t116> <t117>As we descended the hill, we saw Joe Harper, Ben Rogers, and two other boys hiding in the old tannery.</t117> <t118>We untied a small boat and then rowed downstream for more than two miles.</t118> <t119>We only went ashore when we reached a large mound on the hillside.</t119>
<t120>We went to a dense thicket, and Tom made us all swear to keep it a secret.</t120> <t121>Then he pointed to a hole on the hill, right at the thickest part of the thicket.</t121> <t122>We lit candles and then crawled on.</t122> <t123>After about two hundred yards, we reached the cave entrance.</t123> <t124>Tom fumbled around for a way, and then suddenly he slipped under a wall where no one would have guessed there was a hole.</t124> <t125>We squeezed through a very narrow passage and came to a place that looked like a room, damp and cold.</t125> <t126>Then everyone stopped there.</t126> <t127>Tom said:</t127>
<t128>- Now, let's start forming a gang here and call it Tom Sawyer's gang. Anyone who wants to join must swear an oath and sign their name in blood.</t128>
<t129>Anyone who hears it will like it.</t129> <t130>Tom took out a piece of paper on which he had written the oath and read it aloud.</t130> <t131>The oath stated that all those who joined the group must remain loyal and not disclose any secrets; and if anyone harmed a member in any way, that member would be ordered to kill the offender and their entire family, and must carry out the order; and they would not be allowed to eat or sleep until they had killed them and marked their chest with a cross, which was the group's unique symbol.</t131> <t132>Anyone not in the group was not allowed to use that symbol.</t132> <t133>If someone else used it, they would be prosecuted, and if they reoffended, they would be executed.</t133> <t134>If anyone in the group disclosed a secret, they would be beheaded, their body would be burned, their name would be erased from the list with blood, and they would never be mentioned again, they would be cursed and forever forgotten.</t134>
<t135>All of them said that such an oath was really great and asked if it was Tom himself who came up with it.</t135> <t136>He said that he thought of part of it, and the rest he took from books about robbers, and all the famous robbers did the same.</t136>
<t137>There was another kid in the group who thought that if anyone revealed the secret, killing their entire family might be a good idea.</t137> <t138>Tom said that was a good idea, so he took out a pencil and wrote it down immediately.</t138> <t139>Ben Rogers asked:</t139>
<t140>- What about Huck Finn here, he doesn't have a family, so what will he do?</t140>
<t141>- So, why isn't there a dad? - Tom asked.</t141>
<t142>- Yes, it has a father, but currently, its father cannot be found anywhere.</t142> <t143>Its father is always drunk with the filthy people in that tannery, and for more than a year now, its father hasn't been seen around this area.</t143>
<t144>They discussed for a long time and then decided to kick me out of the group.</t144> <t145>Because they said that everyone had to have a family or someone to kill, otherwise it wouldn't be fair.</t145> <t146>Then no one could think of any other way.</t146> <t147>Everyone was stumped, sitting silently.</t147> <t148>I was on the verge of tears.</t148> <t149>But then I came up with an idea, I suggested to them that we could kill Miss Watson.</t149> <t150>They exclaimed: oh Miss Watson, we can kill her.</t150> <t151>Great...</t151> <t152>Let Huck join the group.</t152>
<t153>Each child pricked their fingertip with a needle to draw blood and signed their name; I also wrote my name on that piece of paper.</t153>
<t154>Ben Rogers asked:</t154>
<t155>- So, how are we planning to act now?</t155>
<t156>- It's just about robbing and killing people - Tom replied.</t156>
<t157>- But who should we rob now? Should we rob houses, or cattle, or...</t157>
<t158>Tom Sawyer interrupted:</t158>
<t159>- Taking cattle and things like that is not robbery, it's just petty theft.</t159> <t160>We are not thieves.</t160> <t161>That's not our style.</t161> <t162>We are bandits; on the main road, we stop vehicles, wear masks, kill people, and rob passengers of their watches and money.</t162>
<t163>- But is it really necessary to kill someone?</t163>
<t164>- Yes, there is.</t164> <t165>That's the best way.</t165> <t166>Some well-known guys think differently, but most believe that killing is better, except for those whom we bring back to this cave to hold until they are ransomed.</t166>
<t167>- Redeem? What does that mean?</t167>
<t168>- I don't know either.</t168> <t169>But I see people still doing it that way. I read in a book that it says so.</t169> <t170>And of course, we have to do it that way too.</t170>
<t171>- But if I don't know what it is, how can I do it?</t171>
<t172>- What? Never mind, we absolutely have to do it this way.</t172> <t173>I told you that the book says so.</t173> <t174>Are you planning to do something different from what the book says?</t174> <t175>Are you planning to mess everything up?</t175>
<t176>- Hey Tom Sawyer, all that sounds great, but we really don't know what redeeming means.</t176> <t177>We don't know what to do with them that would be called redeeming?</t177> <t178>That's exactly what we want to understand.</t178> <t179>So, do you understand what redeeming means?</t179>
<t180>- I don't know.</t180> <t181>But maybe it's like if we detain them until they are redeemed, meaning detain them until they die, right?</t181>
<t182>- Roughly, it's like that.</t182> <t183>Isn't it done then?</t183> <t184>So why didn't you make it clear earlier?</t184> <t185>It means we will detain them until they are ransomed or until they die; oh, and there's a whole bunch of other troubles, like providing food and drink, and they always try to escape!</t185>
<t186>- Ben Rogers, you're talking strange.</t186> <t187>How could they escape? We had our men guarding them, ready to shoot them dead at the slightest movement.</t187>
<t188>- There are guards? Ah, that's good.</t188> <t189>That means someone has to sit there all night to watch them and not sleep.</t189> <t190>I think that's really crazy.</t190> <t191>So why doesn't someone just grab a stick and give them a good beating as soon as they bring them here?</t191>
<t192>- Why? Because the book doesn't mention it, that's why.</t192> <t193>Hey Ben Rogers, I'm asking you if you want to do everything by the book or not - that's all.</t193> <t194>Do you think that the person who wrote those books doesn't know what's right?</t194> <t195>Do you think you can teach people anything?</t195> <t196>No way.</t196> <t197>No, sir, you just have to do it like that and redeem them according to the rules.</t197>
<t198> - Fine, I don't need it.</t198> <t199>But anyway, I still say that it's crazy.</t199> <t200>Hey, so do you guys kill women too?</t200>
<t201>- Hey, Ben Rogers, if I were as ignorant as you, I wouldn't talk anymore.</t201> <t202>Kill women?</t202> <t203>No, I've never seen that mentioned in any book.</t203> <t204>We take them back to the cave, and we always have to treat them very sweetly; gradually, they will fall in love with us and won't want to return home anymore.</t204>
<t205>- Ah, if that's the case, then I agree; but I don't care about that matter.</t205> <t206>Because soon enough, this cave of ours will be bustling with women, with those waiting to be ransomed, and then there won't be any space left to accommodate our gang of thieves.</t206> <t207>But anyway, just go on, I won't ask anything else.</t207>
<t208>Little Tommy Barnes, being young, had fallen fast asleep earlier, and when the group woke him up, he burst into tears out of fear, wanting to go home to his mother, and said he didn't want to be a robber anymore.</t208>
<t209>The whole group saw this and teased him even more, calling him a crybaby, which made him furious and he said he would quit immediately and reveal all the secrets.</t209> <t210>But Tom gave him five cents to keep quiet, then told everyone to go home and meet again next week, when they would rob or kill someone.</t210>
<t211>Ben Rogers said that he wasn't allowed to leave the house except on Sundays, so he wanted to start the next Sunday.</t211> <t212>But the group said that if they did it on Sunday, they would be punished by the spirits.</t212> <t213>So that was a no-go.</t213> <t214>Then the group agreed to decide on a date as soon as they could meet again.</t214> <t215>Then, they elected Tom Sawyer as the first commander of the group, and Joe Harper as the second commander.</t215> <t216>After that, the group went home.</t216>
<t217>I climbed over the roof of the stable and slipped through the window just as dawn was breaking.</t217> <t218>My new clothes were covered in filthy dirt, and I was out of breath.</t218>
<t219>Chapter III</t219>
<t220>In the morning, Miss Watson lectured me about my dirty clothes; as for the widow, she didn't scold me at all but just quietly cleaned the stains.</t220> <t221>Seeing that, I felt remorseful and thought that if possible, I should behave well for a while.</t221> <t222>Then Miss Watson pulled me into the small room to pray.</t222> <t223>But it was useless.</t223> <t224>She told me I had to pray every day, and if I did, I would get whatever I wanted.</t224> <t225>But that wasn't true at all, I had tried many times.</t225> <t226>Once, I got a fishing rod but no hook.</t226> <t227>Without a hook, I couldn't do anything.</t227> <t228>I diligently prayed four times but it was useless.</t228> <t229>I then asked Miss Watson to pray for me, but she called me crazy.</t229> <t230>She didn't explain why, and I couldn't understand it at all.</t230>
<t231>Once, I sat deep in the forest and pondered for a long time about that matter.</t231> <t232>I wondered if a person could pray for anything and get it, then why couldn't old Deacon Winn get back the money he lost over the pigs?</t232> <t233>Why couldn't the widow get back her stolen silver snuffbox? Why couldn't Miss Watson get fatter?</t233> <t234>No, there's no such thing; I told myself that.</t234> <t235>So I went and told the widow my thoughts, and she said that the things people pray for are only spiritual blessings.</t235> <t236>That was really hard for me to understand.</t236>
<t237>But then she said what she meant was this: that one must help others, do everything one can for others, always take care of others, and never think of oneself.</t237><t238>If I understood correctly, this should include Miss Watson too.</t238><t239>I went back out into the woods and kept wandering around, thinking about it for a long time, but I couldn't see how it would benefit me, only others.</t239><t240>Finally, I decided not to worry about it anymore and just let it be.</t240><t241>Sometimes the widow would pull me aside and talk about God's blessings; it sounded so tempting.</t241><t242>But then the next day, Miss Watson might take up the same topic and say something completely different.</t242><t243>I thought I had figured out that there were two kinds of God; those who were miserable followed the God the widow talked about, but if someone unfortunately encountered Miss Watson's God, then there was no hope for them.</t243><t244>I kept thinking about this and decided that I would follow the widow's God, if He would have me; although I wasn't sure if He would still be as good once He knew that I was ignorant and liked odd, trivial things.</t244>
<t245>My father has been gone for more than a year now.</t245> <t246>That also makes me feel relieved, because I don't want to see my father anymore.</t246> <t247>Whenever he wasn't drunk and caught me, it was only beatings; so I always ran into the forest, especially when my father was wandering around the house.</t247> <t248>Back then, people found my father drowned in the river downstream, about twenty miles from the town.</t248> <t249>They said that the drowned person had the same build as my father, with tattered clothes and a long, unkempt hair.</t249> <t250>And those things were exactly like my father.</t250> <t251>But no one could clearly see the face, because the body had been in the water for too long, so the face was no longer recognizable.</t251> <t252>They said my father was floating face up on the water.</t252> <t253>They retrieved the body and buried it on the riverbank.</t253> <t254>But I wasn't at ease for long before I suddenly thought of something.</t254> <t255>I knew clearly that a drowned man never floats face up, but face down.</t255> <t256>If that's true, then that body wasn't my father, but perhaps a woman dressed in men's clothing.</t256> <t257>Thinking that made me worried again.</t257> <t258>I guessed that he would soon come back.</t258> <t259>And I kept hoping he wouldn't come back anymore.</t259>
<t260>Occasionally, we pretended to be robbers, played for almost a month, then I withdrew and stopped playing.</t260> <t261>The whole group stopped as well.</t261> <t262>We never robbed anyone, never killed anyone, we just pretended like that.</t262> <t263>We often ran out into the forest, pretending to attack shepherds and women carrying vegetables to the market.</t263> <t264>But we never gathered to take anything from them.</t264> <t265>Tom Sawyer called the sheep gold bars and the turnips and cabbages clothes and furniture.</t265> <t266>Afterwards, our whole group would gather in the cave to discuss our recent actions, counting how many people we had killed and how many marks we had made on the dead.</t266> <t267>But then I found it useless.</t267> <t268>Once, Tom sent someone to town, holding a bright torch which he called the signal (our group's sign whenever we gathered).</t268> <t269>Then he said he had just received secret news from his scouts; reporting that the next day a caravan of very wealthy Spanish and Arab merchants would pass by, camping at Hole Cave; this caravan had two hundred elephants, six hundred camels, and more than a thousand mules, all carrying diamonds and jewels; and they only had four hundred guards.</t269> <t270>So we would set up an ambush, Tom said, ambush and quickly rob them of those items.</t270> <t271>He instructed us to thoroughly clean our knives, swords, and guns and be ready.</t271> <t272>His kind couldn't even handle a vegetable cart, but he insisted on having swords and guns cleaned until they shone to do those things; although the swords and guns were just wooden sticks, broom handles, no matter how much they were cleaned or polished, they were still worth no more than a pile of firewood.</t272> <t273>I didn't believe we could defeat such a caravan of Spanish and Arabs, but I wanted to see the elephants and camels, so the next day I also joined the ambush.</t273> <t274>That Saturday, after receiving the order, we left the forest and ran down the hill.</t274> <t275>But we didn't see any Spaniards or Arabs, nor any camels or elephants.</t275> <t276>It was just a group of small schoolchildren from the convent school on a Saturday afternoon picnic.</t276> <t277>We rushed into that group and herded the children into the cave.</t277> <t278>But we didn't get anything except a sweet bread and some bacon, Ben Rogers grabbed a ragged doll, Joe Harper grabbed a church hymn book and a small Bible.</t278> <t279>Then suddenly the teacher appeared, making us drop everything and run away.</t279> <t280>I didn't see any diamonds or jewels at all.</t280> <t281>I told Tom Sawyer that.</t281> <t282>He said there were plenty.</t282> <t283>He also said there were Arabs, elephants, and all sorts of things there.</t283> <t284>I asked why I didn't see them?</t284> <t285>He said how stupid I was, if I had read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without having to ask him like that.</t285> <t286>He said it was because of magic. There were hundreds of soldiers, elephants, treasures, etc... but because we had many enemies, what he called magicians had turned all those things into a group of schoolchildren on a picnic, so they tricked us like that.</t286> <t287>I said then let's go find those magicians and fight them. Tom Sawyer called me an idiot.</t287> <t288>He said:</t288>
<t289>- How can that be?</t289> <t290>The magician can summon a bunch of gods, they will chop you into pieces immediately.</t290> <t291>Those gods are as big as trees, as large as a church.</t291>
<t292>I said:</t292>
<t293>- If we had a few gods like that helping us, could we defeat the other group?</t293>
<t294>- How did I end up with those gods?</t294>
<t295>- I don't know either.</t295> <t296>But then how did they get it?</t296>
<t297>- They rub their hands against the tin lamp or the iron ring, and then that genie comes roaring, with thunder and lightning flashing around him, smoke billowing up, and whatever task they are commanded to do, they can do it immediately.</t297> <t298>They might not need to use any strength to uproot a fortress or tie up the school supervisor or anyone else on it and carry them away.</t298>
<t299>- Then who could call them to gather noisily around like that?</t299>
<t300>- Who else would rub the lamp or the ring?</t300> <t301>These genies are under the command of anyone who rubs the lamp or the ring, and they must do everything according to that person's orders.</t301> <t302>If told to build a forty-mile-long castle entirely out of diamonds, and fill that castle with chewing gum, or anything else one desires, and then bring back a princess, the daughter of the Emperor of China, to marry, they must do it all, and they must complete these tasks before the sun rises the next morning. Moreover, these genies must also move the castle to any place one wishes.</t302> <t303>Do you understand?</t303>
<t304>I said:</t304>
<t305>- If then I think that they are just a bunch of fools who don't know how to keep that castle for themselves but instead waste it like that.</t305> <t306>Moreover, if I were one of those gods, I would just ask for enough, there's no reason to leave my work to serve people every time they rub the tin lamp like that.</t306>
<t307>- Huck Finn, you're very foolish.</t307> <t308>When someone rubs the lamp, whether they want to or not, those genies have to appear.</t308>
<t309>- So, will I be as big as this, as big as the church?</t309> <t310>That would be great: I will go to that place; but I intend to make that person climb the tallest tree in this land.</t310>
<t311>- Stop it, Huck Finn, talking to you is utterly boring.</t311> <t312>You're not completely clueless, yet you're entirely foolish.</t312>
<t313>I had to think about this for a few days.</t313> <t314>I planned to see if there was anything real in it.</t314> <t315>I went to find an old tin lamp and an iron ring, took them out to the forest, and rubbed and rubbed until I was sweating, having already planned to build a castle to sell.</t315> <t316>But it was useless, no genie appeared.</t316> <t317>After that, I concluded that all those absurd stories were just one of Tom Sawyer's many lies.</t317> <t318>I was sure he believed there were real Arabs and elephants; but as for me, I thought differently.</t318> <t319>Because clearly, they were just a bunch of students from the local school.</t319>
<t320>Chapter IV</t320>
<t321>Four months have passed, and now it is the middle of winter.</t321> <t322>All this time, I have been going to school and have learned to spell, read, write a little, and have memorized the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five.</t322> <t323>I am not sure if I could get any better than that if I were to live longer.</t323> <t324>Anyway, I do not like math very much.</t324>
<t325>At first, I really hated going to school, but gradually, as I attended classes, I found it bearable.</t325> <t326>Whenever I felt tired or unwell, I would skip school.</t326> <t327>And the next day, after getting a beating, I would study diligently and more enthusiastically.</t327> <t328>Thus, studying became easier for me over time.</t328> <t329>I also got used to the widow's temperament and didn't find it too annoying.</t329> <t330>Living in a house, sleeping on my own bed, sometimes I felt it was somewhat confining.</t330> <t331>Therefore, before the weather got too cold, I would occasionally sneak out to sleep in the forest.</t331> <t332>To me, that felt like a break.</t332> <t333>I preferred the old ways of living the most.</t333> <t334>But when I had to live like this, I kind of liked it a bit.</t334> <t335>The widow told me that adapting to these things, though slow, was reliable and left no room for criticism.</t335> <t336>She said she wasn't ashamed of me.</t336>
<t337>One morning while I was having breakfast, I accidentally knocked over the salt dish.</t337> <t338>I hurriedly scooped it up with my hand and threw it over my left shoulder to avoid bad luck, but suddenly Miss Watson appeared right in front of me and stopped me.</t338> <t339>She said:</t339>
<t340>- Huck, let go of that, why are you always playing with dirty things?</t340>
<t341>The widow added a light sentence; but that couldn't prevent me from the misfortune, I knew that very well.</t341> <t342>After the meal, I stepped outside, feeling anxious and fearful, not knowing where that misfortune would befall me and not knowing what it would be like.</t342> <t343>There are ways to avoid some bad luck, but this case was not among them; so I didn't know what to do, just wandering around with sad and fearful thoughts.</t343>
<t344>I went down to the garden, climbed over the fence gap, at the place where people usually come and go.</t344> <t345>On the ground, the newly fallen snow covered a few inches, and I suddenly saw human footprints.</t345> <t346>These footprints came from the direction of the mountain, stopped at this gap for a while, and then went around the fence.</t346> <t347>How strange, who would linger there like that but not come in?</t347> <t348>I couldn't figure it out.</t348> <t349>Anyway, it was very peculiar.</t349> <t350>I was about to follow the footprints, but I bent down to look at them closely first.</t350> <t351>At first, I didn't notice anything, but then I realized.</t351> <t352>There was a cross mark on the heel of the left shoe made with large nails, meant to ward off evil spirits.</t352>
<t353>I immediately jumped up and ran down the hill.</t353> <t354>Every now and then, I looked back, but saw no one.</t354> <t355>I ran as fast as I could to Judge Thatcher's house.</t355> <t356>He saw me and asked:</t356>
<t357>- What's wrong, why are you in such a hurry?</t357> <t358>Are you here to collect the interest?</t358>
<t359>I replied:</t359>
<t360>- No, sir, that's not it.</t360> <t361>So, there is interest for me?</t361>
<t362>- Yes, of course. As of yesterday, it has been half a year.</t362> <t363>That means it's more than one hundred and fifty dollars.</t363> <t364>A substantial amount for you.</t364> <t365>But it's best if you let me keep it and add it to the six thousand dong from before, otherwise, if you take it back, you'll end up spending it all.</t365>
<t366>- No, sir, I don't want to spend all six thousand, just like before.</t366> <t367>I want you to take it, it's a gift for you, all six thousand, everything.</t367>
<t368>The old man was very surprised.</t368> <t369>It seemed that he couldn't understand why.</t369>
<t370>The old man asked:</t370>
<t371>- What do you mean by saying that?</t371>
<t372>- Please don't ask me any more questions about that.</t372>
<t373>Keep that money, do you want to?</t373>
<t374>He said:</t374>
<t375>- I'm really having a hard time.</t375> <t376>What's the matter with you?</t376>
<t377>I replied:</t377>
<t378>- Please take all the gold and don't ask me what I'm doing anymore.</t378> <t379>I don't want to lie.</t379>
<t380>The old man thought for a moment and then said:</t380>
<t381>- Okay, I understand now.</t381> <t382>So, you want to sell all of your assets to me, not give them as a gift.</t382> <t383>Is that correct?</t383>
<t384>Then he wrote something on a piece of paper, read it aloud, and said:</t384>
<t385>- Do you see? It says here it's a contract.</t385> <t386>That means I bought it from you and paid you.</t386> <t387>Here, take one dollar.</t387> <t388>Now sign here.</t388>
<t389>I signed my name and then left</t389>
<t390>Jim, the black man who worked for Miss Watson, had a tuft of hair as big as a fist that he got from the fourth stomach compartment of a cow, and he used it for magic tricks.</t390> <t391>He claimed that inside the tuft of hair was a creature that knew everything.</t391> <t392>That night, I went to Jim out of curiosity and told him that my father was in the snow.</t392> <t393>What I wanted to know was what my father would do and if he intended to stay there.</t393> <t394>Jim took out the tuft of hair, mumbled something to it for a while, then held it up high, and let it fall to the floor.</t394> <t395>The tuft of hair fell with a thud and rolled a few inches.</t395> <t396>Jim picked it up again, let it fall once more, and the tuft of hair listened.</t396> <t397>But it was useless.</t397> <t398>Jim said that the tuft of hair didn't want to speak.</t398> <t399>Jim said that sometimes it wouldn't speak without money.</t399> <t400>I told him I had a fake twenty-five cent coin, old and unusable.</t400> <t401>I kept repeating this (I had already planned not to mention the dollar Judge Thatcher had just given me).</t401> <t402>I said the coin was very bad, but maybe the tuft of hair would accept it.</t402> <t403>Because perhaps it couldn't tell the difference between good and bad.</t403> <t404>Jim took the coin, sniffed it, bit it, then rubbed it clean.</t404> <t405>Then he said he would trick the tuft of hair into thinking it was a good coin.</t405> <t406>He said he would split a raw potato and place the coin in the middle, leave it overnight, and by the next morning, it wouldn't look like a coin anymore and wouldn't be dirty; anyone in town could mistake it for a real coin, let alone the tuft of hair.</t406> <t407>Previously, I had known how to do this with a potato, but I had forgotten over time.</t407>
<t408>Jim placed the coin under the tuft of hair and then knelt down to listen.</t408> <t409>This time he said the tuft of hair had given a sign.</t409> <t410>He said the tuft of hair would tell me I could become as rich as I wanted.</t410> <t411>I said, okay, go ahead and do it.</t411> <t412>So the tuft of hair spoke to Jim, and Jim relayed to me that:</t412>
<t413>- We don't know yet what your father will do.</t413> <t414>He might go far away, or he might decide to stay.</t414> <t415>But it's best to stay calm and let him do whatever he wants.</t415> <t416>There are two angels flying around him.</t416> <t417>A white angel, bright and sparkling.</t417> <t418>And one angel is black.</t418> <t419>The white angel guides him along the good path for a while, then the black angel jumps in and ruins everything.</t419> <t420>It's impossible to say which angel will ultimately take him.</t420> <t421>But as for you, there's nothing to worry about.</t421> <t422>Your life will encounter many troubles, but also many joys.</t422> <t423>Sometimes you will be in pain, sometimes you will be weak, but each time you will recover as usual.</t423> <t424>There are two young women who will hover around you throughout your life.</t424> <t425>One is fair-skinned, the other is dark-skinned.</t425> <t426>One is rich, the other is poor.</t426> <t427>You will marry the poor one first, then the rich one.</t427> <t428>You must stay away from rivers and waters as much as possible.</t428> <t429>And above all, don't do anything risky, because if they record your name, you will be hanged.</t429>
<t430>That night, just as I lit the candle and went up to the room, I saw my father sitting there from who knows when. Yes, it was definitely my father!</t430>
<t431>Chapter V</t431>
<t432>I had just closed the door and turned around to see him sitting there.</t432> <t433>Whenever I saw him, I was always terrified because he had beaten me so many times.</t433> <t434>At that moment, I was very frightened, but just a minute later, I realized I was mistaken - that is, after the initial shock, so to speak, when my breath suddenly caught due to the unexpected sight of him there, I no longer felt scared, and thus there was nothing to worry about.</t434>
<t435>My father is about fifty years old.</t435> <t436>His hair is long, messy, hanging down, and dirty.</t436> <t437>Through that hair, you can see his bright eyes shining out, as if he were hiding behind a grapevine and looking at you.</t437> <t438>His hair is completely black without a single gray strand, and the long sideburns intertwine with each other as well.</t438> <t439>Looking at his face, except for the places without hair, there is no other color, just white, not the kind of white everyone has, but a white that makes the flesh of people cringe.</t439> <t440>A white like that of a climbing plant, a white like the belly of a fish.</t440> <t441>As for his clothes, apart from a few tattered pieces, there is nothing else.</t441> <t442>He sits cross-legged, the shoe on the leg that is crossed over has its mouth open, a toe sticking out, occasionally wiggling.</t442> <t443>His hat thrown on the floor is a wide-brimmed, black hat, old, with a huge hole on the crown that looks like a door frame leading down to a ship's hold.</t443>
<t444>I stood looking at him.</t444> <t445>He also sat looking at me, the back of the chair slightly tilted backward.</t445> <t446>I placed the candle down.</t446> <t447>I noticed that the window had been raised, so he must have climbed through the warehouse roof to get in here.</t447> <t448>He kept looking all over me like that.</t448> <t449>After a while, he spoke:</t449>
<t450>- Your clothes look really cool.</t450> <t451>Do you think you look like someone important?</t451>
<t452>I replied:</t452>
<t453>- It could be like that, or it might not be.</t453>
<t454>He asked again:</t454>
<t455>- Have you been badmouthing me?</t455> <t456>Since I've been away, you've been acting all high and mighty, huh? I'll bring you down a notch before I give up on you.</t456> <t457>I've heard people say that you're educated, that you can read and write.</t457> <t458>Now you think you're better than your father, don't you; because your father can't read or write.</t458> <t459>Fine, I'll show you.</t459> <t460>Who told you that you could get involved in such crazy things, huh?</t460> <t461>Who gave you the right to do that?</t461>
<t462>- The widow, did she tell you that?</t462>
<t463>- A widow? Then who told her to meddle in something that isn't her business?</t463>
<t464>- No one told her anything.</t464>
<t465>Alright, I'll teach her not to get involved.</t465> <t466>And you listen here: you better stop, no more studying, got it?</t466> <t467>I'll let them know not to raise a child who thinks they can look down on their father and believe they're better than they actually are.</t467> <t468>If I catch you studying again, you'll be in trouble, got it?</t468> <t469>Your mother couldn't read or write until the day she died.</t469> <t470>No one in this family knew how to read or write before they died.</t470> <t471>I don't know how either.</t471> <t472>So why do you think you have the right to do so now?</t472> <t473>I'm not the kind of person who can tolerate that, got it?</t473> <t474>Now, try reading something out loud for me?</t474>
<t475>I picked up a book, started reading a bit about Washington and the war, I read.</t475>
<t476>About half a minute later, he flicked the book to the corner of the room with his hand and said:</t476>
<t477>- Ah, you can read it again?</t477> <t478>I've heard people say that, but I still doubt it, not fully believing it yet.</t478> <t479>Listen here, stop acting all high and mighty, I don't like it.</t479> <t480>I'm telling you, my child.</t480> <t481>If I catch you lingering around that school again, I'll give you a good beating.</t481> <t482>First of all, you need to know that you must listen to me.</t482> <t483>I've never seen a child like this before.</t483>
<t484>He picked up a colorful photograph with some cows and a child in it, and asked me:</t484>
<t485>- What is this?</t485>
<t486>- That is their reward for you because you memorized the lesson</t486>
<t487>He immediately tore up the photo and said:</t487>
<t488>- I will give you something better.</t488> <t489>I will give you the whip.</t489>
<t490>Then he sat muttering, grumbling for a long time and then said:</t490>
<t491>- The type of pampered young master, drenched in perfume, right?</t491> <t492>There’s a bed, bed sheets.</t492> <t493>There's even a mirror. Ah, and there's also a carpet on the floor.</t493> <t494>While your father has to sleep with the pigs in the tannery.</t494> <t495>Never have I seen a child like this.</t495> <t496>I must make you get rid of all those pretentious airs first, then we’ll talk.</t496> <t497>Well, you still haven’t dropped those manners, have you? They say you’re very rich, is that true?</t497> <t498>How did you become rich?</t498>
<t499>- They are lying, there's no such thing.</t499>
<t500>- Hey, watch your mouth when you talk to me.</t500> <t501>Everything I could have done, I always dared to do, so don't try to deceive me.</t501> <t502>I've been out of town for the past two days.</t502> <t503>Even down by the river, people were saying the same thing.</t503> <t504>That's why I came here.</t504> <t505>Tomorrow, you have to give me that money; I need it.</t505>
<t506>- I don't have any money</t506>
<t507>- Speak, old man.</t507> <t508>Judge Thatcher took that money.</t508> <t509>You have it.</t509> <t510>I need that money.</t510>
<t511>- I'm telling the truth, I don't have any money.</t511> <t512>Just go ask Judge Thatcher, he will tell you the same thing.</t512>
<t513>- Okay, then I'll ask him, I'll talk to him to see what's going on.</t513> <t514>Hey, how much do you have in your pocket right now?</t514> <t515>Give it to me, I need it.</t515>
<t516>- I only have one dollar.</t516> <t517>I was planning to...</t517>
<t518>- Whatever you intend to do, I don't care, I don't need to know, just hand it over.</t518>
<t519>He immediately grabbed the coin and bit it to see if it was good; then he said he was going downtown to get some whiskey, claiming he hadn't had a drop all day.</t519> <t520>As he stepped out into the darkness, he turned back and warned me not to act like I was better than him.</t520> <t521>When I thought he was gone, he came back, stuck his head in, and warned me to be careful with that school, or he would come and give me a beating if I didn't quit.</t521>
<t522>The next day, he was completely drunk, stumbled to old chief Thatcher's house, intending to force him to hand over all the money.</t522> <t523>But it was useless; then he swore he would bring the old chief to justice.</t523>
<t524>The village chief and the widow went to court to get me out of my father's hands and to have the court assign one of them as my guardian.</t524> <t525>But there was a new judge who had just arrived, who didn't know what kind of person my father was, and said that the court had no right to interfere in separating families, but rather should reunite them, and certainly couldn't force a child to be away from their father.</t525> <t526>So, the village chief Thatcher and the widow had to give up.</t526>
<t527>That made my father so delighted that he couldn't sit still.</t527> <t528>He said he would beat me black and blue if I didn't give him the money.</t528> <t529>I borrowed three dollars from old Judge Thatcher and gave it to him, and he went off to get drunk; then he wandered around town, talking nonsense and causing trouble everywhere; carrying an iron pot and roaming until midnight.</t529> <t530>Then they arrested him and put him in jail for a week.</t530> <t531>But he said that it was all worth it; he was very pleased because he had asserted his authority over me.</t531>
<t532>When he got out of prison, the new judge who had just been transferred said he would teach my father to become a proper person.</t532> <t533>The judge took my father to his private home, dressed him in clean, beautiful clothes.</t533> <t534>Morning, noon, and evening, he let my father eat with his family, treating him very kindly.</t534> <t535>Something like that.</t535> <t536>After dinner, the judge sat and talked to my father about how to live properly in various ways, to the point that my father cried, saying he had been foolish and had ruined his life.</t536> <t537>My father promised that from now on he would change his behavior and become a person that no one would be ashamed of anymore.</t537> <t538>He also hoped that the judge would help him and not despise him.</t538> <t539>The judge said that hearing such words from my father was truly heartening.</t539> <t540>So both the judge and his wife cried too.</t540> <t541>My father said that he had always been misunderstood.</t541> <t542>The judge said he also believed that was the case.</t542> <t543>My father then said that what a person needs deep in their heart is affection.</t543> <t544>The judge said: exactly.</t544> <t545>So both sides cried again.</t545> <t546>When it was time to go to bed, my father stood up, spread his arms, and said:</t546>
<t547>- Here, ladies and gentlemen, look at me.</t547> <t548>Please take my hand and let me shake hands with you.</t548> <t549>This is a hand that used to be like a pig's hoof; but now it is not anymore; this is the hand of a person who has started to step into a new life.</t549> <t550>If I ever go back to the old ways, I would rather die.</t550> <t551>Ladies and gentlemen, please remember these words well, and do not forget that it was I who said them.</t551> <t552>Now this is a clean hand, so please shake hands without fear.</t552>
<t553>One by one, people came to shake hands, and then everyone cried.</t553> <t554>The judge's wife even bent down to kiss that hand.</t554> <t555>Then my father made a solemn vow.</t555> <t556>The judge said that it was truly the most sacred moment, or almost so.</t556> <t557>Then they took my father to a splendid room, which was a private room.</t557> <t558>At night, when my father was extremely thirsty, he climbed over the gate roof, clung to a column, slid down to the ground, took the coat they had just given him to exchange for a bottle of liquor, then climbed back to the room and drank to his heart's content until dawn, when he crawled out, drunk, crashing into the gate so hard that his left hand got injured in several places.</t558> <t559>In the morning, when someone found him, he was nearly frozen to death.</t559> <t560>When everyone entered that private room, they saw that the furniture was all in disarray.</t560>
<t561>The chief judge was very sad.</t561> <t562>He said that perhaps only a gunshot could help my father change his ways, as there was no other way.</t562>
<t563>Chapter VI</t563>
<t564>Then, right after that, my father got up again, walked around, went to Mr. Thatcher's house to make him return the money, and then came to me asking why I hadn't quit school yet.</t564> <t565>He held onto me for a long time and beat me.</t565> <t566>But I still kept going to school as usual.</t566> <t567>All day long, I had to avoid him and run away.</t567> <t568>Before, I didn't really want to go to school, but now I thought I had to go to school to show my father.</t568> <t569>The legal proceedings were so slow.</t569> <t570>It seemed like they hadn't even started yet.</t570> <t571>Occasionally, I had to borrow a few dollars from Mr. Thatcher to give to my father to avoid being beaten.</t571> <t572>Every time he had money, he would get drunk, and every time he got drunk, he would cause trouble in town, and every time he caused trouble, he would end up in jail.</t572> <t573>It became a habit, a routine.</t573>
<t574>My father kept hanging around the widow, and the widow said if he didn't go find food somewhere else, she would make trouble for him.</t574> <t575>Well, I don't know if he's crazy or not; he even said he would show everyone who has the right to know who has authority over Huck Finn. Then one spring day, he somehow caught me, took me down to a boat, and went upriver about three miles; then rowed up to the Illinois shore, in a place with dense trees, where there wasn't a single house except an old cabin hidden by thick foliage, and anyone who didn't know the place wouldn't be able to find it.</t575>
<t576>Day and night, he kept me close by his side, I had no way to escape to go to school.</t576> <t577>So the two of them lived in that hut.</t577> <t578>My father locked the door all day; at night he kept the key at the head of his bed.</t578> <t579>He had a gun that I guessed he had stolen from somewhere.</t579> <t580>The two of them went fishing and hunting, living like that day after day.</t580> <t581>Occasionally, he would lock the door, trapping me inside, then go down to a store three miles away, at the ferry to trade birds and fish for whiskey, come back drunk at night, and beat me.</t581> <t582>Later, the widow found out where I was, and sent someone to spy and take me back.</t582> <t583>But my father chased them away with his gun.</t583> <t584>Living like that for a while, I got used to the place and even came to like it.</t584> <t585>I liked everything except for the beatings.</t585>
<t586>It was a kind of laziness that was quite pleasant.</t586> <t587>All day long, just relaxing, smoking, fishing, no books and no studying at all.</t587> <t588>About two months later, my clothes were dirty and tattered.</t588> <t589>I didn't think that when I was living with the widow, I ever liked it as much as this.</t589> <t590>Because there, I had to wash clothes.</t590> <t591>I had to eat with bowls and plates, comb my hair, go to bed and get up on time, always worry about books and notebooks, and listen to Miss Watson's nagging all day long.</t591> <t592>I didn't feel like going back to that place anymore.</t592> <t593>Before, I had stopped using bad language because the widow didn't like it.</t593> <t594>But now, I started again because my father didn't forbid it at all.</t594> <t595>Living in the forest was truly enjoyable, everywhere was just as delightful.</t595>
<t596>But gradually, when my father became too familiar with this forest, I began to feel that I couldn't stand it anymore.</t596> <t597>I kept getting beaten all the time.</t597> <t598>He often went far away and locked me in the house.</t598> <t599>Once, he locked the door and kept me inside for three whole days.</t599> <t600>I felt terribly lonely.</t600> <t601>I thought that if he drowned somewhere, I would be stuck here, unable to get out.</t601> <t602>I was so scared and thought to myself that I definitely had to find a way to escape.</t602> <t603>I had tried several times but failed.</t603> <t604>There wasn't a single window big enough for a dog to squeeze through. The chimney was also too narrow to crawl through.</t604> <t605>The door was thick, made entirely of very sturdy ebony planks.</t605> <t606>My father was careful not to leave a knife or any other object in the house whenever he went away.</t606> <t607>I figured I had searched the house hundreds of times, always thinking of ways to escape, and spent all my time on that, but it was still to no avail.</t607> <t608>But this time, I found something.</t608> <t609>I found an old, rusty saw blade without a handle, wedged under the roof crevice.</t609> <t610>I cleaned it and started working.</t610> <t611>There was a piece of felt used to pad the saddle, nailed to the crumbling part of the wall in the corner of the house, right behind the table, to block the wind from blowing through the gaps and extinguishing the lamp.</t611> <t612>I crawled under the table, lifted the piece of felt, and sawed a hole just big enough for me to squeeze through.</t612> <t613>It was quite a time-consuming task, but I tried my best to see it through.</t613> <t614>In the midst of it, I heard my father's gunshot in the forest.</t614> <t615>I erased all traces, let the felt fall back down, and hid the saw.</t615> <t616>Just as I finished, my father stepped in.</t616>
<t617>He didn't seem very happy at that moment.</t617> <t618>Besides, it had always been like that.</t618> <t619>He said he had just returned from the province, and the work was a complete mess.</t619> <t620>The lawyer told my father that he would win the lawsuit and get money if they brought the matter to trial.</t620> <t621>But then they found ways to prolong the matter, and old Judge Thatcher was very skilled at this sort of thing.</t621> <t622>Then he said that people outside the province were hoping for another trial to get me away from my father and bring me back to the widow so she could take care of me, and they believed that this time they would definitely succeed.</t622> <t623>That made me very confused, because I didn't want to go back to the widow to be bound and civilized as I used to say.</t623> <t624>After that, my father started cursing, cursing everything and everyone.</t624> <t625>He cursed anyone he thought of.</t625> <t626>He cursed and cursed to show that he wouldn't spare anyone, and after he had cursed everyone, he made a summary curse, including a lot of people whose names he didn't even know.</t626> <t627>That meant those people whom he had to refer to as "that guy... what's his name" whenever he cursed them.</t627> <t628>After getting tired of cursing, he started cursing from the beginning again.</t628>
<t629>He said he would see how the widow planned to take me back.</t629> <t630>He would guard me carefully, and if they tried to trick him, there was a place six or seven miles from here where he would hide me, and they could search all they wanted, but they would never find me.</t630> <t631>That made me uneasy.</t631> <t632>But only for a moment.</t632> <t633>Because I had already decided that I wouldn't be here by the time he did that.</t633>
<t634>He ordered me to go out to the boat to fetch the letters he had just brought back.</t634> <t635>There was a bag of flour weighing about more than twenty pounds, a piece of lard, bullets, and four large bottles of whiskey, along with an old book and two newspapers for cleaning, and a few other miscellaneous items.</t635> <t636>I carried everything, stepped out to the bow of the boat, and then sat down to rest.</t636> <t637>I kept thinking to myself, planning that when I escaped, I would take the gun and some fishing rods and run into the forest.</t637> <t638>I planned not to stay in one place but to travel all over the country, moving at night, hunting and fishing to survive.</t638> <t639>In this way, I would go so far that my father and the widow would never be able to find me again.</t639> <t640>I thought I would saw through the piece of wood and escape that very night if my father was already drunk, and I guessed he would be.</t640> <t641>I thought so much about it that I didn't know how long I had been sitting there.</t641> <t642>Until my father yelled, asking if I was asleep or had drowned there.</t642>
<t643>I carried everything into the tent.</t643> <t644>By then, it was almost dark.</t644> <t645>While I was preparing dinner, he downed another glass of wine, warmed up, and then went to cause trouble again.</t645> <t646>Previously, in the province, he was already dead drunk, sleeping on the roadside every night, looking very miserable, people might have thought he was Adam.</t646> <t647>Covered in mud, when the alcohol kicked in, he often sought out the authorities.</t647> <t648>This time he spoke.</t648>
<t649> - Huh! And you call that a government?</t649><t650>Let's see what it has done.</t650><t651>This is the law.</t651><t652>The law is ready to take people away, huh?</t652><t653>People have to work hard and worry so much to raise their stepchildren.</t653><t654>Yes, that's right, people raise their children to grow up, and when they are about to start working to earn something to support their parents, this is what happens.</t654><t655>The law is made to help people. And you call that a government! It's not a government at all.</t655><t656>The law supports that old Thatcher and helps him take all my property?</t656><t657>Here, this is what the law does; the law takes six thousand dollars from people and forces them into an old trap in a house like this, making them wander around in clothes not even fit for pigs.</t657><t658>And you call that a government.</t658><t659>With a government like this, people have no rights at all.</t659><t660>Sometimes I think it's better to just leave this place for good.</t660><t661>Yes, I told everyone that, I said it straight to Thatcher's face.</t661><t662>Many people heard me say that and can confirm that I said it.</t662><t663>I said just give me two cents and I would leave this cursed place immediately and never come back.</t663><t664>And everyone says the same thing.</t664><t665>Here, look at my hat - if you can even call it a hat, the top pops off, and the rest falls down to my chin.</t665><t666>How can you call that a hat anymore?</t666><t667>Putting my head in the hat is like sticking it into a chimney.</t667><t668>Here, look, this is how my hat fits.</t668><t669>If I had all my rights, I would be one of the richest people in the province...</t669>
<t670>Ah, yes, yes, this government is really very good.</t670> <t671>There, try to see.</t671> <t672>There was a free black man from Ohio who came, he was almost white, nearly like a white person.</t672> <t673>He wore the whitest shirt anyone had ever seen, and the most stylish hat.</t673> <t674>No one in this province had clothes better than his; then he had a gold watch, with a gold chain, and a silver-tipped cane, truly a millionaire, with gray hair, the most formidable in this land.</t674> <t675>What do you think?</t675> <t676>People say he is a university professor, able to speak various languages, knowledgeable about everything.</t676> <t677>And that’s not even the worst of it.</t677> <t678>They also say that he can vote just by sitting at home.</t678> <t679>Ah, who can tolerate that?</t679> <t680>I wonder what will become of this country?</t680> <t681>On election day, I was about to go vote - if I wasn’t drunk and could go - then I suddenly heard that in this country there’s a state where they don’t let black people vote, so I immediately withdrew my vote.</t681> <t682>I said that I would never bother to vote, let the country say what it wants about me.</t682> <t683>As long as I live, I will definitely not vote.</t683> <t684>Just look at the indifferent attitude of that black man, he wouldn’t be ready to give up his seat for me unless I pushed him aside.</t684> <t685>I told everyone why not auction off that black man?</t685> <t686>That’s all I needed to know.</t686> <t687>Do you know what they answered me?</t687> <t688>What else, they said that he hasn’t been in this land for six months yet so he can’t be auctioned off.</t688> <t689>Ah, so this is a government that considers itself a government, and insists that it is a government, thinking that’s what makes a government; yet it stays silent for six months before daring to touch a black man who robs, horrendous; wearing a white shirt and being free, and then...</t689>
<t690>My father was talking while walking around like that, not even noticing that his old but still flexible legs were taking him somewhere.</t690><t691>Suddenly, he fell headfirst into a barrel of salted meat, scraping both his shins.</t691><t692>So, the end of his speech turned into a very lively language - mostly still talking about the black man and the government - while he angrily kicked the barrel around the house.</t692><t693>He hopped on one leg around the room, holding one shin, then let it down and held the other leg, then suddenly kicked the barrel very hard.</t693><t694>But unfortunately, one of his shoes had a hole with some toes sticking out.</t694><t695>He hit the barrel; he let out a blood-curdling scream; then he rolled on the ground, holding his toes.</t695><t696>Now, I don't know when he started cursing me.</t696><t697>Later, he himself said the same thing.</t697><t698>He had heard of Mr. Sowberry Hagan in his glorious days and said that he had influenced him.</t698><t699>But I think that was probably just something my father made up.</t699>
<t700>After finishing dinner, my father grabbed the bottle of liquor again, saying there was enough for two regular drinks and one really drunk session.</t700> <t701>He always said that.</t701> <t702>I had planned that within about an hour he would be so drunk he wouldn't know anything, and then I would either steal the key or saw through the piece of wood to get out; one of the two ways.</t702> <t703>My father kept drinking steadily and then lay down on the bed a while later.</t703> <t704>But I really wasn't lucky at all.</t704> <t705>It wasn't that my father was sound asleep, he was just tired.</t705> <t706>He mumbled, muttered, turned this way and that for a long time.</t706> <t707>Finally, I waited so long that I got too sleepy to keep my eyes open.</t707> <t708>So, before I knew what was happening, I had fallen fast asleep while the candle was still burning.</t708>
<t709>I don't know how long I had been asleep; but suddenly a scream startled me awake.</t709> <t710>I saw my father, his face very angry, running around from corner to corner, shouting that there was a snake.</t710> <t711>He said the snake had crawled up his leg and then suddenly jumped up screaming, saying that one had bitten his cheek.</t711> <t712>I didn't see any snake at all, but he kept running around the house, shouting: Catch it! Catch it! It bit my neck right here! Never had I seen anyone with such fierce eyes.</t712> <t713>After a while, he was so exhausted that he collapsed, gasping for breath; then he moved very quickly, his legs hitting all the furniture in the house, his hands flailing in the air, his mouth still screaming, saying that some ghosts had come to take him away.</t713> <t714>Gradually, too tired, he lay still for a while, but his mouth still groaned.</t714> <t715>Then he lay completely still, with no more sound.</t715> <t716>I faintly heard the sound of owls hooting and wolves howling in the distant forest; and at that moment the silence was terrifying.</t716> <t717>My father still lay motionless in the corner of the house.</t717> <t718>A moment later, he sat up, tilted his head to one side to listen, then whispered:</t718>
<t719>- Clop - clop, clop - clop; the dead are passing through here; clop - clop, clop - clop; they are chasing me, but I am not going anywhere.</t719> <t720>Oh, oh, they have arrived here already! Don't touch me! Don't! Don't! Go away, their hands are so cold! Let me go!</t720> <t721>Oh! oh! Please spare this wretched man!</t721>
<t722>Then he knelt on all fours, crawling and bowing to be forgiven, then curled himself up in a blanket, then when he got close to the old table made from a pine stump; his mouth kept begging, begging until he was tired, then he cried.</t722> <t723>Through the blanket, I could hear every single word clearly.</t723>
<t724>Then a little later, he threw off the blanket and stood up straight.</t724> <t725>His face looked even more ferocious, staring intently at me and stepping closer.</t725> <t726>He chased me around the house, holding a pocket knife, calling me the Grim Reaper, and saying he would kill me.</t726> <t727>So I couldn't get close to him.</t727> <t728>I begged, telling him that I was just Huck.</t728> <t729>But he let out a terrifying laugh, roared curses back, and kept chasing me.</t729> <t730>I ran, then suddenly turned around and slipped under his arm, somehow he managed to grab the back of my shirt.</t730> <t731>I thought to myself that I was done for.</t731> <t732>But as quick as lightning, I slipped out of my shirt and escaped.</t732> <t733>After a while, he got so tired that he collapsed, leaning against the door, and said he would rest for a minute before killing me.</t733> <t734>He tucked the knife into his waistband, saying he would take a nap to regain strength and then show me what he could do.</t734>
<t735>Then he nodded off to sleep.</t735> <t736>A moment later, I slipped under the seat, quietly crawled up, without making a sound, and took down the gun.</t736> <t737>I pulled out the magazine to check if it was loaded, then placed the gun on the crate of radishes, aiming it directly at my father.</t737> <t738>Then I sat there quietly, waiting to see if he would move.</t738> <t739>At that moment, time seemed to pass so slowly and silently.</t739>
<t740>Chapter VII</t740>
<t741>- Wake up! What do you think you're doing?</t741>
<t742>I opened my eyes wide and looked around, trying to think where I was.</t742> <t743>At that moment, the sun had risen, and I had just had a deep sleep.</t743> <t744>My father was standing in front of me, looking sad and tired.</t744> <t745>My father asked:</t745>
<t746>- Why did you bring the gun here?</t746>
<t747>I guess my father didn't know anything about what he had done the night before, so I said:</t747>
<t748>- It seems like someone intends to enter the house, so I have to sit here and keep watch.</t748>
<t749>- Why didn't you call me to wake me up?</t749>
<t750>- Yes, I called Dad to wake him up but it didn't work.</t750> <t751>I shook him for a long time but he wouldn't wake up.</t751>
<t752>- Fine, stop sitting here and rambling.</t752> <t753>Go outside and check if there's any fish on the line to bring back for breakfast.</t753> <t754>I'll come out in a bit.</t754>
<t755>My father unlocked the door, and I dashed out to the riverbank.</t755> <t756>Seeing a few floating branches and scattered pieces of bark, I knew the water had started to rise.</t756> <t757>I thought to myself that if I were in the city right now, I would be playing and having fun.</t757> <t758>June is the season of rising water, which always brings me a lot of luck.</t758> <t759>Because whenever the water rises, driftwood and logs float down, along with pieces of rafts, sometimes dozens at a time.</t759> <t760>All I have to do is collect them and sell them to the lumber yard or sawmill.</t760>
<t761>I followed along the riverbank, heading upstream, keeping an eye on my father while also looking to see if the rising water might bring anything useful.</t761><t762>Suddenly, a boat drifted by, a very beautiful boat, about three or four meters long, with its bow raised like a duck's beak.</t762><t763>From the riverbank, I dove in headfirst like a frog, fully clothed, towards the boat.</t763><t764>I guessed that there must be someone lying inside the boat, because it was common for people to lie inside and then pop their heads out to laugh at you.</t764><t765>But this time, there was no one.</t765><t766>It was surely an abandoned drifting boat.</t766><t767>I climbed in and used my feet to paddle the boat towards the shore.</t767><t768>I thought to myself that my father would be very pleased to see it - the boat was worth ten dollars - but when I reached the shore, he was still nowhere to be seen.</t768><t769>I pushed the boat into a small inlet, overgrown with small leaves and willows, and suddenly had another idea.</t769><t770>I planned to hide the boat well, so instead of running into the forest, I could drift down the river about fifty miles and anchor somewhere, saving time and avoiding the effort of running on foot.</t770>
<t771>This place is quite close to the hut.</t771> <t772>I thought I heard my father's footsteps approaching.</t772> <t773>But I had already hidden it, and after hiding it, I looked through the willow bushes and saw my father walking down the small path, raising his gun to aim at birds.</t773> <t774>So that means he doesn't know anything yet.</t774>
<t775>When my father came back, I awkwardly grabbed a fishing rod.</t775> <t776>He asked me why I took so long, and I told him I had just fallen into the river, which is why it took so long.</t776> <t777>I knew he would ask when he saw my clothes were soaking wet.</t777> <t778>The two of us caught five big fish on the line and then returned to the hut.</t778>
<t779>After finishing breakfast, we went back to sleep.</t779> <t780>Both of us were exhausted.</t780> <t781>I thought about how to ensure that neither my father nor the widow could pursue me anymore.</t781> <t782>Perhaps trusting in luck and going far away so they couldn't find me was the safest bet.</t782> <t783>Because who knows, maybe nothing would happen.</t783> <t784>After thinking for a long time, I couldn't come up with any solution.</t784> <t785>My father sat up for a moment, drank some water, and then said:</t785>
<t786>- Next time someone comes snooping around here, you have to call me out immediately, understand?</t786> <t787>That person coming here doesn't have good intentions.</t787> <t788>I'll shoot them dead.</t788> <t789>Remember to call me out next time, understand?</t789>
<t790>Then he lay down again and slept.</t790> <t791>What he just said made perfect sense to me.</t791> <t792>I told myself that I could use that excuse, and from now on, no one would think about chasing me anymore.</t792>
<t793>By around twelve noon, the two of us stepped out of the house and walked along the riverbank.</t793> <t794>The river water was rising quite quickly.</t794> <t795>Rotten branches were also floating along with the rising water.</t795> <t796>A little later, a nine-piece raft floated down.</t796> <t797>We rowed the boat out to pull it to shore.</t797> <t798>Then we went to have lunch.</t798> <t799>If it had been anyone else but my father, they would have waited there all day to see if they could pick up anything else, but my father was not like that.</t799> <t800>Those nine pieces of the raft were enough for one meal, as he could take them to town and sell them.</t800> <t801>So he locked the door, locked me in, and went out to take the small boat to tow the raft pieces.</t801> <t802>It was around three-thirty in the afternoon then.</t802> <t803>I guessed he wouldn't be back tonight.</t803> <t804>I waited until I figured he had gone before taking out the saw and continuing to saw through that wooden wall.</t804> <t805>Before my father crossed to the other side of the river, I had already crawled through the hole.</t805> <t806>Looking at my father with the raft, he was just a tiny dot on the very distant water surface.</t806>
<t807>I took the bag of noodles and brought it to the hiding place, pushing aside the thick branches and placing the boat there.</t807> <t808>Then I took the fat, the bottle of whiskey, all the coffee and sugar from the house, all the bullets, the cotton stuffed with medicine, the water scoop, the wooden basin, a spoon and a metal cup, my saw, two blankets, a pot, and a coffee pot.</t808> <t809>I took the fishing rod, matches, and other things, anything worth even a penny.</t809> <t810>After that, I cleaned everything up thoroughly.</t810> <t811>I needed an axe, but there wasn't one in the house.</t811> <t812>There was only one at the woodpile, but I had already planned to leave it there.</t812> <t813>I also took the gun.</t813> <t814>That was everything.</t814>
<t815>Because I had to crawl through the hole to get out and move a lot of furniture through it, the ground in that spot was dug up quite a bit.</t815> <t816>So I figured that from the outside, I would cover it to hide the rough spot with sawdust.</t816> <t817>Then I put the wooden plank back in its original place.</t817> <t818>I wedged two pebbles underneath and one on top to hold the plank firmly in place, and that spot sloped down without touching the ground.</t818> <t819>If someone stood four or five steps away, they wouldn't be able to see the sawed spot and wouldn't know about it; besides, this was the back of the house, and probably no one would bother to go around there anyway.</t819>
<t820>From here to the hiding place, it's all grass, so there are no traces left behind.</t820> <t821>I walked around once to check again.</t821> <t822>I stood on the riverbank looking out into the distance.</t822> <t823>Everything was safe.</t823> <t824>Then I took the gun and walked a distance into the forest.</t824> <t825>Usually, when domestic pigs escape from the pen, they easily turn into wild boars.</t825> <t826>I immediately shot this pig and dragged it back home.</t826>
<t827>I took the axe and struck the door with a strong blow.</t827> <t828>It took a lot of hitting, quite a long time to break the door.</t828> <t829>I dragged the pig inside, pulled it near the table, then struck the pig's neck with an axe, leaving it on the ground for a while to let the blood flow out.</t829> <t830>I say ground because it was real ground, just compacted earth, not wood flooring, then I grabbed an old bag, filled it with large pebbles, heavy enough for me to drag, then from the pig's location, I dragged the bag of pebbles to the door, through the woods to the riverbank, and threw it down there.</t830> <t831>The bag of pebbles sank, disappearing completely.</t831> <t832>Anyone could see that something had been dragged along the ground.</t832> <t833>I wished Tom Sawyer were here at this moment because I knew he would love this kind of thing and would add more details to make it even more thrilling.</t833> <t834>For such stories, no one could boast more than Tom Sawyer.</t834>
<t835>Then I pulled out some hairs, smeared blood all over the axe blade, stuck some hairs onto the axe, and threw it in the corner of the house.</t835> <t836>I picked up the pig, held it against my chest, covered it with my shirt (so that the blood wouldn't drip), and carried it to a spot behind the house to throw it into the river.</t836> <t837>At that moment, I thought of something else.</t837> <t838>I went to the boat to get a bag of flour and a saw and brought them into the house.</t838> <t839>I put the bag of flour back in its original place, used the saw to poke a hole at the bottom of the bag, because there wasn't a pocket knife around to do everything.</t839> <t840>Then I carried the bag of flour about a hundred yards past the grass field, through the willow bushes to the east of the cabin, to a shallow but wide hole about five miles long, filled with reeds that in season would also be full of ducks.</t840> <t841>There was a small stream leading to the far side of the lake, several miles away.</t841> <t842>I didn't know exactly where it went, but I was sure it didn't run into the river.</t842> <t843>The flour fell through the hole in the bag, leaving a long trail from the house to the lake.</t843> <t844>I also threw my father's whetstone there, to make it look accidental.</t844> <t845>Then I tied a string around the hole in the flour bag to stop it from spilling out.</t845> <t846>Then I took the bag of flour and the saw back to the boat.</t846>
<t847>At this time, the sky was nearly dark.</t847> <t848>I pushed the boat downwards, to the spot where the willow trees on the shore drooped down, and I sat there waiting for the moon to rise.</t848> <t849>I tied the boat to the base of the willow, took out a piece of bread to eat, and after eating, I lay back in the boat, smoked a cigarette to think of a new plan.</t849> <t850>I told myself that they would surely follow the trail of the gravel bag to the riverbank and then along the shore to find me.</t850> <t851>Then they would follow the flour trail to the hole, and follow the stream to somewhere to find the robbers who had killed me and taken my belongings.</t851> <t852>They would scour the river with the sole task of finding my body.</t852>
<t853>They will get tired of searching and won't bother thinking about me anymore.</t853> <t854>Great, I can stop wherever I want.</t854> <t855>Jackson Island is a place where I can take refuge.</t855> <t856>I know that island very well, no one ever goes there.</t856> <t857>Then at night, I can paddle up to the top, wander around, and steal whatever I need.</t857>
<t858>At that time, I was quite tired.</t858> <t859>The first thing to do was to sleep.</t859> <t860>When I woke up, it took me a minute to realize where I was.</t860> <t861>I sat up, looked around, a bit scared.</t861> <t862>Then I remembered.</t862> <t863>The river stretched vast and wide for miles.</t863> <t864>The moon was so bright.</t864> <t865>I couldn't count all the pieces of wood drifting, black and silent, a few hundred meters from the shore.</t865> <t866>Everything was as silent as death.</t866> <t867>It seemed very late at night, I could sense it was very late.</t867> <t868>I'm sure you understand what I mean - I can't find the right words to say it properly.</t868>
<t869>I let out a long yawn and stretched.</t869> <t870>Just as I was about to take off my shirt and start on my way, I suddenly heard a distant sound on the water.</t870> <t871>I listened carefully and immediately recognized the creaking sound of oars grinding against the rowlocks in the stillness of the night.</t871> <t872>I poked my head out from the willow bushes and saw a boat gliding on the river.</t872> <t873>It was impossible to tell how many people were on the boat.</t873> <t874>Only when it came closer did I see that there was only one person on the boat.</t874> <t875>I guessed it might be my father, although deep down I thought he couldn't be back yet.</t875> <t876>The boat continued to drift with the current, past my hiding spot, and then after a while, it docked at the shore where the water was still.</t876> <t877>It came so close that I almost reached for my gun and aimed at him.</t877> <t878>Oh, it was indeed my father - and he wasn't drunk either, judging by the way he handled the oars.</t878>
<t879>I did not waste a single moment.</t879> <t880>Just a minute later, I was already gliding the boat downstream, light and fast, in the darkness close to the shore.</t880> <t881>I rowed for more than two miles, then rowed a few hundred more yards to the middle of the river.</t881> <t882>Because in just a moment, I would be passing the ferry dock, and if someone saw me, they might call out.</t882>
<t883>I steered the boat through the floating logs on the river, stuffing a few pieces at the bottom of the boat to let it drift along.</t883> <t884>I lay down to rest again, smoked a cigarette, and looked up at the clear sky without a single cloud.</t884> <t885>On a moonlit night, lying on my back and looking up at the sky, it seemed incredibly high; I had never seen the sky so high before.</t885> <t886>On such nights, one can hear the sounds on the water from very far away.</t886> <t887>I heard people talking near the ferry dock.</t887> <t888>I clearly heard every word of the folk songs.</t888> <t889>Someone said that now the days are long and the nights are short.</t889>
<t890>Another person said this was not yet one of the short nights; and both laughed.</t890> <t891>Then they woke up another person to laugh again, but the other person didn't laugh and uttered a vulgar phrase to let him sleep in peace.</t891> <t892>The first person said to stop and take that to tell his old wife - she would listen.</t892> <t893>Then he said that it was nothing compared to what he had said before.</t893> <t894>I heard someone else say that it was already almost three in the morning; wishing not to have to wait more than a week for it to be morning.</t894> <t895>Then after that, the conversation gradually faded; gradually faded, I could no longer hear each word clearly.</t895> <t896>But I could still hear murmurs, occasionally a few laughs, but it seemed very distant.</t896>
<t897>Now, I was far away from the ferry dock.</t897> <t898>I sat up, seeing Jackson Island, about more than two miles down the river.</t898> <t899>The island had many dense trees, lying in the middle of the river, large and dark, as steady as a big ship without lights.</t899> <t900>The way to the port was unobstructed, the mounds had sunk below the water surface.</t900>
<t901>I rowed to the place without spending much time.</t901> <t902>I turned the canoe through the whirlpool and into the calm stream, then glided it into the still water, docking on the Illinois side.</t902> <t903>I pushed the canoe into a deep pool inside the shore that I had known before.</t903> <t904>I had to part the willow bushes to push the canoe in, and I did it quickly so no one outside could see.</t904>
<t905>I climbed up and sat on a fallen tree at the edge of the island and looked out at the wide river.</t905> <t906>Looking at the black floating logs, then looking towards the town three miles away, I saw three or four twinkling lights.</t906> <t907>A huge raft was coming down from upstream, about a mile from where I was sitting; a light was lit in the middle of summer.</t907> <t908>I watched as a raft slowly drifted right to where I was, and someone said: Row harder! That's it! Push the edge of the paddle down! I heard the voice booming as if the person was standing right next to me.</t908>
<t909>The sky had started to turn gray.</t909> <t910>I walked into the forest and lay down to sleep for a while before having breakfast.</t910>
<t911>Chapter VIII</t911>
<t912>When I woke up, the sun was already high in the sky, I guessed it was past eight o'clock.</t912> <t913>I lay on the grass, in the cool shade, not thinking about much, feeling rested, both reassured and content.</t913> <t914>After a few empty months, I could see the sun.</t914> <t915>All around were large trees, so the place was quite dark.</t915> <t916>There were also spots where sunlight pierced through the leaves and shone on the ground, and the sunlight there shimmered like a gentle breeze blowing through.</t916> <t917>A pair of squirrels sat on a branch, looking at me and chattering in a friendly manner.</t917>
<t918>I feel so comfortable and steady here that I become lazy and don't want to get up to cook a meal.</t918> <t919>But then, as I close my eyes to sleep again, I suddenly hear a boom outside by the river.</t919> <t920>I prop myself up on my elbows, listening intently.</t920> <t921>After a while, I hear another sound.</t921> <t922>I stand up and step out, looking outside through a gap in the bushes.</t922> <t923>A cloud of smoke spreads over the water, drifting farther away—perhaps all the way to the ferry dock.</t923> <t924>Then a boat full of people is coming down this way.</t924> <t925>Now I know what is happening.</t925> <t926>Boom! A puff of white smoke comes out from the boat.</t926> <t927>They are firing cannons into the river to make my body float to the surface.</t927>
<t928>I was hungry, but I couldn't start a fire at that moment because they might see the smoke.</t928> <t929>So I had to sit there watching the cannon smoke and listening to the explosions.</t929> <t930>The river was wide and even more beautiful here.</t930> <t931>If there was anything to be curious about, I would sit there for a long time to see how they would search for my dead body.</t931> <t932>I wondered why people would put mercury into loaves of bread and let them float down the river, and then those loaves would stop exactly where there was a drowned body.</t932> <t933>I told myself to stay calm and see what happens; if I didn't see those loaves floating by to find me, I would reveal myself.</t933> <t934>I walked around the island to the Illinois shore to see if there was anything there.</t934> <t935>And I wasn't too disappointed.</t935> <t936>A large loaf of bread floated by.</t936> <t937>I used a long stick to pull it in, but I slipped, and the loaf floated away again.</t937> <t938>The spot where I was standing was where the current was closest to the shore, I knew that already.</t938> <t939>A while later, another loaf floated by, and this time I managed to catch it.</t939> <t940>I pried off the stopper, shook out the mercury, and then took a bite.</t940> <t941>Wow, it was a genuine piece of bread, very valuable, not like the miserable cornbread I had been eating before.</t941>
<t942>I went looking for a good spot in the thick woods, sat on a log, chewing on some bread while watching the boat, feeling incredibly relaxed.</t942> <t943>Suddenly, I was startled; because at that moment I thought, what if the widow, or the schoolteacher, or someone had prayed for these pieces of bread to find me?</t943> <t944>If so, then there must be something in the bread.</t944> <t945>Meaning that when the widow's family or the schoolteacher prayed, it went into the bread?</t945> <t946>But I thought it probably wouldn't matter to me.</t946> <t947>And whatever it was, it would likely be something good for me anyway.</t947>
<t948>I lit a cigarette, took a long drag, and then sat back looking outside.</t948> <t949>The boat continued to follow the current, and I would have a chance to see clearly who was on it when it got closer to my spot.</t949> <t950>Because it would definitely come closer, just like the piece of bread that had floated to that point.</t950> <t951>When it got really close to me, I put out the cigarette and went back to the spot where I had fished out the piece of bread earlier.</t951> <t952>I lay down flat, hiding behind a log; this spot was a bit open, so I could peek out from a crack in the log.</t952>
<t953>Then the boat came closer, so close that just throwing a plank could allow one to step ashore.</t953> <t954>Everyone was on the boat; my father, old man Thatcher, then Becky Thatcher's daughter, then Joe Harper, then Tom Sawyer, then Tom's Aunt Polly, then Sid, then Mary, and a few others.</t954> <t955>Everyone was discussing the murder case.</t955> <t956>But suddenly the boat owner said:</t956>
<t957>- Look closely, the water flows closest to the shore here, perhaps it drifted onto the land and got caught in some bush near the water's edge.</t957> <t958>I hope so.</t958>
<t959>But as for me, I didn't hope for that.</t959> <t960>The whole group leaned forward, sticking out from the side of the boat, right in front of me, and everyone silently watched attentively.</t960> <t961>I could see them very clearly, but they couldn't see me.</t961> <t962>Suddenly, the boat owner shouted:</t962>
<t963>- Back off.</t963>
<t964>Then the sound of the cannon exploded right in front of me, making my ears deaf and my eyes almost blind from the gun smoke; I almost thought I was done for.</t964> <t965>If there had been real bullets in there, they would have found the body they were looking for.</t965> <t966>Thank God, I saw that I wasn't hurt at all.</t966> <t967>The boat continued on and disappeared around the bend of the island.</t967> <t968>Occasionally, I could still hear the booming sounds getting fainter, and then about an hour later, I couldn't hear anything anymore.</t968> <t969>The island was three miles long, and I guessed they had reached the other end and given up the search.</t969> <t970>But they continued.</t970> <t971>They went around the other end of the island and then followed the narrow stretch of the river up to the Missouri shore and then turned back.</t971> <t972>Well, now it was all quiet.</t972> <t973>No one was searching for me anymore.</t973> <t974>I took my belongings from the boat, set up a nice little resting spot in the thick trees.</t974> <t975>I used a blanket to make a small tent and put my belongings inside to keep them from getting wet in the rain.</t975> <t976>I caught a fish, used a saw blade to gut it, and waited until sunset to start my campfire to cook dinner.</t976> <t977>After that, I set a fishing line in the river so that I would have fish for breakfast the next morning.</t977>
<t978>It was completely dark, I sat by the fire smoking and felt very interested.</t978> <t979>But gradually, I also felt how lonely it was, if I went to sit by the river listening to the murmuring water, looking up at the sky counting stars, then counting the branches and rafts drifting down from above; getting bored and then going to sleep.</t979> <t980>When to kill time.</t980> <t981>Can't sit still like that forever, it has to end soon somehow.</t981>
<t982>I kept living like that for three days and nights.</t982> <t983>Nothing changed.</t983> <t984>Everything remained the same.</t984> <t985>The next day, I searched around where I lived and went down to the lower part of the island.</t985> <t986>I was the master of the island.</t986> <t987>The whole island was mine, so to speak, and I wanted to know everything about this island in detail.</t987> <t988>Actually, it was just to pass the time.</t988> <t989>I found a lot of ripe and delicious berries, and even green summer grapes; the rice fruits were also starting to sprout, and eventually, it would be time to harvest them all.</t989>
<t990>Just like that, I wandered deeper into the forest until I guessed that this place wasn't far from the other end of the island anymore.</t990> <t991>I had a gun in my hand but hadn't fired a single shot.</t991> <t992>The gun was just for self-defense, and I also thought I would shoot an animal near its den.</t992> <t993>At that moment, I almost stepped on a rather large snake, which slithered into the grass and flowers to escape.</t993> <t994>I chased after it, determined to shoot the snake.</t994> <t995>While I was in hot pursuit, I suddenly stumbled upon a pile of ashes from a campfire that was still smoldering.</t995>
<t996>My heart seemed to leap in my chest.</t996> <t997>I didn't wait to see anything else, I slowly lowered my gun and quietly tiptoed backward, retreating very quickly.</t997> <t998>Occasionally stopping for a second in the thick foliage and listening; but my breath was so loud that my ears couldn't hear anything.</t998> <t999>I took a deep breath, then listened again; then took another breath.</t999> <t1000>Seeing a fallen tree trunk, I thought there was someone.</t1000> <t1001>Stepping on a dry branch that snapped with a crack, I felt as if someone had cut my breath in half, and I could only hold onto a very short half-breath.</t1001>
<t1002>Returning to the tent, I felt uneasy.</t1002> <t1003>I felt that I was no longer as bold as before.</t1003> <t1004>But I told myself: there is no time to wander around.</t1004> <t1005>Then I moved all the belongings down to the boat so that no one would see them.</t1005> <t1006>I extinguished the fire, scattered the ashes around to make it look like an old fire from last year, then I climbed up a tree and sat.</t1006>
<t1007>I guess I've been sitting on the tree for several hours, seeing nothing and hearing nothing else.</t1007> <t1008>But in my mind, it felt like I had seen and heard thousands of things. Well, I couldn't stay on the tree like that forever.</t1008> <t1009>After that, I slid down and remained among the dense trees, always keeping an eye out.</t1009> <t1010>I had only eaten a few fruits from the tree and some leftover food from breakfast.</t1010>
<t1011>It was already night by then.</t1011> <t1012>My stomach was growling with hunger.</t1012> <t1013>Waiting until it was completely dark, I slipped out from the shore, before the moon rose, and pushed the boat towards the Illinois shore, about half a mile away.</t1013> <t1014>I went into the forest to cook dinner and planned to stay there all night.</t1014> <t1015>Suddenly, I heard a clattering sound.</t1015> <t1016>I told myself: there are horses coming.</t1016> <t1017>Then, there were voices.</t1017> <t1018>I quickly loaded everything back onto the boat, then went back into the forest to see if I could spot anything.</t1018> <t1019>After crawling a few steps, I heard someone speak:</t1019>
<t1020>- If we can find a good spot, we should stop here; the horses are very tired.</t1020> <t1021>Let's look around here.</t1021>
<t1022>I no longer waited for anything, the sky receded and I immediately pushed the boat away.</t1022> <t1023>I tied the boat back to its old spot and intended to sleep under the boat.</t1023>
<t1024>I couldn't sleep much.</t1024> <t1025>Moreover, I couldn't sleep because I had to think.</t1025> <t1026>Every time I suddenly woke up, I felt as if someone was coming to grab my neck.</t1026> <t1027>So sleeping was of no use.</t1027> <t1028>Gradually, I told myself that I couldn't live like this, I had to find out who the person coming to live on this island with me was.</t1028> <t1029>I would find out, otherwise, I had to escape.</t1029> <t1030>I thought it would be better to do it right away.</t1030>
<t1031>Then I pushed the boat away from the shore a bit, and just let it drift downstream.</t1031>
<t1032>The moon was shining brightly.</t1032> <t1033>Except for the places with shadows, the moonlight illuminated everything as if it were daytime.</t1033> <t1034>I paddled the boat for about an hour; everything was silent and asleep like stones.</t1034> <t1035>This time, I had reached the other end of the island.</t1035> <t1036>A gentle, cool breeze began to blow.</t1036> <t1037>This meant that the night was almost over.</t1037> <t1038>I kicked the water with my foot, turned the boat around, and headed towards the edge of the forest.</t1038> <t1039>I sat down on a fallen tree trunk, looking through the leaves.</t1039> <t1040>The moon had disappeared, and darkness once again covered the river.</t1040> <t1041>But after a while, looking up through the treetops and seeing a faint light, I knew that dawn was approaching.</t1041> <t1042>I took my gun and quietly approached the spot where I had seen the campfire earlier.</t1042> <t1043>Every minute or two, I stopped to listen.</t1043> <t1044>But unfortunately, I couldn't find any sign of the fire.</t1044> <t1045>I slowly and carefully walked to that spot.</t1045> <t1046>When I arrived, I saw someone lying on the ground.</t1046>
<t1047>I thought it was a ghost.</t1047> <t1048>The person lying there had wrapped a piece of blanket around their head and was resting right next to the fire. I stood silently behind the bushes, about a meter away from where that person was lying, and stared intently.</t1048> <t1049>The sky was getting light.</t1049> <t1050>A moment later, the person yawned, stretched, and threw off the blanket. Oh, it turned out to be Jim, the black man who worked for Miss Watson.</t1050> <t1051>I was really glad to see Jim here.</t1051> <t1052>I spoke up:</t1052>
<t1053>- Hello Jim!</t1053>
<t1054>Then jumped out suddenly.</t1054>
<t1055>Jim started and jumped up, looking at me in horror.</t1055> <t1056>Then he knelt down, clasped his hands, and said:</t1056>
<t1057>- Please don't do anything to me, don't!</t1057> <t1058>I never harm ghosts.</t1058> <t1059>I always love the dead, and whatever I can do for them, I will gladly do.</t1059> <t1060>Please go back to the river.</t1060> <t1061>Where did you come from, please don't do anything to poor Jim.</t1061> <t1062>I've always been your friend</t1062><t1063>!</t1063>
<t1064>I also didn't have to spend much time explaining to him that I wasn't dead.</t1064> <t1065>I was so happy to meet Jim here.</t1065> <t1066>Now I am no longer lonely.</t1066> <t1067>I told him that if he went and told everyone that I was here, I wouldn't be afraid.</t1067> <t1068>I kept talking, but he just sat there looking at me without saying a word.</t1068> <t1069>Then I told him.</t1069>
<t1070>- It's morning already.</t1070> <t1071>Let's have a light meal.</t1071> <t1072>Light the fire.</t1072>
<t1073>- Why start a fire?</t1073> <t1074>To roast some strawberries and wild herbs here?</t1074> <t1075>But you have a gun, don't you?</t1075> <t1076>We can find something better to eat than strawberries, my friend!</t1076>
<t1077>- Dậu with wild vegetables, oh so you live on those things</t1077><t1078>?</t1078>
<t1079>- I couldn't find anything else</t1079>
<t1080>- Oh, so how long have you been on this island?</t1080>
<t1081>- I came here right after the night you were killed!</t1081>
<t1082>- Really, since that day until now</t1082><t1083>?</t1083>
<t1084>- Yes, that's right</t1084>
<t1085>- So, you must be starving to death, right?</t1085>
<t1086>- If I think about it now, I can eat a lot.</t1086> <t1087>Alright, buddy. So, how long have you been on this island?</t1087>
<t1088>- From the night I was killed</t1088>
<t1089>- Oh, why is that? Then what do you live on? Ah, but you have a gun.</t1089> <t1090>Yes, you have a gun.</t1090> <t1091>That's very good.</t1091> <t1092>Now you go shoot something, and I'll stay here and start a fire.</t1092>
<t1093>Both of us went to the place where the canoe was hidden.</t1093> <t1094>Then, while Jim started a fire on a patch of grass among the surrounding trees, I went to get the bacon and coffee, the coffee pot; the pan, then the sugar, and the tin cups.</t1094> <t1095>The black man was very frightened because he thought that all these things were the result of some witchcraft.</t1095> <t1096>I caught a big fish, and Jim used his pocket knife to clean it and then fried it.</t1096>
<t1097>After finishing, we just lay on the grass and ate a hot breakfast.</t1097> <t1098>Jim ate vigorously because he was extremely hungry.</t1098> <t1099>Once full, we sprawled out, not wanting to do anything else.</t1099>
<t1100>Then Jim said:</t1100>
<t1101>- But hey, Huck, if it wasn't you, then who was killed in that house?</t1101>
<t1102>At that moment, I recounted the whole story to him; he said it was truly ingenious.</t1102> <t1103>He said that even Tom Sawyer couldn't come up with a trick better than mine.</t1103> <t1104>I asked:</t1104>
<t1105>- Jim, how did you end up here, and how did you get here?</t1105>
<t1106>He seemed puzzled for a minute, saying nothing, then he replied:</t1106>
<t1107>- Perhaps I shouldn't say anything, my friend</t1107>
<t1108>- What's wrong, Jim?</t1108>
<t1109>- For many reasons.</t1109> <t1110>But if I tell you, you mustn't tell anyone else, Huck!</t1110>
<t1111>- Jim, I swear I won't tell anyone</t1111>
<t1112>- Alright, I trust you. I... I'm going to run away.</t1112>
<t1113>- Jim!</t1113>
<t1114>- See, you said you wouldn't tell.</t1114> <t1115>You remember you promised not to tell anyone, Huck.</t1115>
<t1116>- Yes, I already said that.</t1116> <t1117>I said I wouldn't talk, and I won't talk.</t1117> <t1118>I will keep my promise.</t1118> <t1119>Even if people call me a coward, an anti-Black oppression sympathizer, and despise me for keeping my mouth shut, it's fine, it doesn't matter.</t1119> <t1120>I will not speak.</t1120> <t1121>And I won't go back there either.</t1121> <t1122>Now, you tell me everything.</t1122>
<t1123>Here, like this, buddy.</t1123> <t1124>My aunt, that is Mrs. Watson, keeps tormenting me all day and treating me terribly.</t1124> <t1125>But she still says she won't take me down to Orleans to sell me.</t1125> <t1126>But I noticed that there was a new black slave trader around here last night, and I started to get scared.</t1126> <t1127>Then one late night, I crawled to the door, which wasn't fully closed, and I heard her telling the widow that she would take me to Orleans to sell, but she didn't want to sell me right away because she could still get eight hundred dollars more for me.</t1127> <t1128>With such a large amount of money, she probably couldn't resist.</t1128> <t1129>The widow wanted to tell her not to do that.</t1129> <t1130>But at that moment, I didn't wait to hear what happened next.</t1130> <t1131>I ran away quickly.</t1131> <t1132>I'm telling you the truth.</t1132>
<t1133>I ate a hearty meal and then hurried down the hill, hoping to steal a boat somewhere along the riverbank in town, but there were too many people around, so I had to hide in the old ruined tavern by the river to wait for everyone to leave.</t1133> <t1134>I had to wait until the end of the year.</t1134> <t1135>There were always people around.</t1135> <t1136>Around six o'clock, boats started passing by, and all I could hear was talk about your father going to town to report that you had been killed.</t1136> <t1137>The boats that followed were all carrying distinguished gentlemen and ladies going to the scene to investigate.</t1137> <t1138>Occasionally, they would dock their boats to rest for a while before continuing on.</t1138> <t1139>So, by listening to their conversations, I learned the whole story about the murder.</t1139> <t1140>When I heard you were really killed, I was heartbroken, Huck.</t1140> <t1141>But now, I am no longer heartbroken.</t1141>
<t1142>All day long I have to hide here like this.</t1142> <t1143>I'm hungry but I'm not afraid.</t1143> <t1144>Because I know that Mrs. Watson and the widow will go check on that right after breakfast.</t1144> <t1145>That will take the whole day.</t1145> <t1146>And they also know that during the day I am out herding cattle, so they won't see me around here, and if they ask about me, they'll have to wait until nightfall.</t1146> <t1147>As for the other workers, no one needs me for anything, and as soon as the owners leave the house, they also sneak off to rest.</t1147>
<t1148>It was dusk when I finally ventured out; I walked along the riverbank and after a few miles reached a place with no houses at all.</t1148> <t1149>I had already carefully planned in my mind what I was going to do.</t1149> <t1150>You see, if I just kept walking, dogs could track me down by scent; if I stole a boat to cross the river, they would notice the missing boat, figure out where I crossed, and then trace my footprints.</t1150> <t1151>So I thought using a raft would be the best option, as it wouldn't leave any traces.</t1151>
<t1152>Then at that moment, a light shone, and I grabbed a floating plank in front of me, swimming out to the middle of the river; I blended in with the driftwood floating on the river, pulled my neck back, and kept swimming downstream for a long distance along with the floating rafts.</t1152> <t1153>Then I kept swimming like that, pulling in a few more logs with the plank for security.</t1153> <t1154>At that time, the clouds gathered and darkened the sky for a while.</t1154> <t1155>I climbed up and lay on the plank in the area where the light was still on and people were passing by.</t1155> <t1156>The river water was rising rapidly and flowing swiftly.</t1156> <t1157>I estimated that by around four in the morning, I would have floated twenty-five miles downstream; I would then swim to the shore before dawn.</t1157> <t1158>Then I went into the forest towards Illinois.</t1158>
<t1159>But truly, I was unlucky.</t1159> <t1160>Just as I reached the edge of the island, there was a person holding a lantern behind me.</t1160> <t1161>Seeing that I couldn't delay, I immediately plunged into the water, leaving the island to swim elsewhere.</t1161> <t1162>It was terrifying; I thought I could get ashore anywhere, but no, the riverbank was steep everywhere.</t1162> <t1163>When I swam close to the other end of the island, I found a good spot.</t1163> <t1164>I went into the forest, thinking that I couldn't continue using the raft, because drifting like that, I would surely encounter the light.</t1164> <t1165>I had a pipe and a torn tobacco pouch with some matches in my shirt that hadn't gotten wet, so I felt reassured.</t1165>
<t1166>- So, from that day until now, you haven't had any meat or cake to eat?</t1166> <t1167>Why don't you find some roots in the mud to eat?</t1167>
<t1168>- How can I get it?</t1168> <t1169>How can I retrieve it?</t1169> <t1170>What can I do with just a stone in my hand? And at night, how can I get it?</t1170> <t1171>During the day, I don't dare go to the riverbank for fear of being seen.</t1171>
<t1172>- Ah, I see, so you have to stay in the forest all day long.</t1172> <t1173>That's right.</t1173> <t1174>Did you hear them firing cannons?</t1174>
<t1175>- Yes, I do. I know they are looking for you.</t1175> <t1176>I saw them passing by here.</t1176> <t1177>I hid in the bushes and watched.</t1177>
<t1178>A few young birds here flew over, only flying short distances of a few yards before perching again.</t1178> <t1179>Jim said it was a sign of rain.</t1179> <t1180>He said that when chicks fly erratically, it means rain is coming, so seeing birds fly like that also made him predict rain.</t1180> <t1181>I intended to catch a few birds, but Jim wouldn't let me.</t1181> <t1182>He said doing so would bring death.</t1182> <t1183>He said that his father once fell seriously ill, and when someone else caught birds, his father told him that doing so would cause his father to die.</t1183> <t1184>And indeed, he died.</t1184>
<t1185>Jim also said that one should not plan ahead what to cook for dinner, as it would bring bad luck.</t1185> <t1186>And shaking out the tablecloth at sunset is the same.</t1186> <t1187>He also said that when the sun rises the next morning, the bees would already know.</t1187> <t1188>If not, the bees would fall ill, refuse to work, and eventually die. Jim said that bees never sting fools.</t1188> <t1189>But I don't believe that, because I've tried it several times and still haven't been stung.</t1189>
<t1190>Before that, I had heard about those things but hadn't heard everything. Jim knew the omens.</t1190> <t1191>He said he knew most of them.</t1191> <t1192>I said it seemed to me that all the omens were bad, so I asked Jim if there were any good omens.</t1192> <t1193>Jim said:</t1193>
<t1194>- Very little.</t1194> <t1195>And those things are of no use to anyone.</t1195> <t1196>Why do you want to know, do you want to keep it?</t1196> <t1197>Then Jim said again:</t1197>
<t1198>- If you have a lot of hair on your arms and chest, it's a sign that you're about to get rich.</t1198> <t1199>Such an omen can be useful; the more hair you have, the luckier you are.</t1199> <t1200>You see, at first, you might be poor.</t1200> <t1201>But if you don't know in advance that it's a sign you'll become rich, you might get discouraged and commit suicide.</t1201>
<t1202>- Do you have a lot of arm hair, Jim?</t1202>
<t1203>- What's the point of asking that, can't you see I'm here?</t1203><t1204>.</t1204>
<t1205>- Yeah, so are you rich?</t1205>
<t1206>- No, I was rich once before, and I will be rich again.</t1206> <t1207>Once I had fourteen dollars, but I went into speculative trading, and unfortunately lost it all.</t1207>
<t1208>- Speculating on what, Jim?</t1208>
<t1209>- First of all, it's about stockpiling</t1209>
<t1210>- Hoarding what?</t1210>
<t1211>- And what else - livestock, you know.</t1211> <t1212>I spent ten dollars to buy a cow.</t1212> <t1213>But then I almost had nothing left because as soon as I got the cow, it died.</t1213>
<t1214>- So you lost ten dollars, huh?</t1214>
<t1215>- No, I didn't lose all ten đồng, I only lost nearly nine đồng.</t1215> <t1216>Because I sold the cowhide for one đồng.</t1216>
<t1217>- So you have five and a half dimes left.</t1217> <t1218>Do you have anything else to speculate on?</t1218>
<t1219>- Yes, of course. Do you know the black cripple who works for Mr. Bradish?</t1219><t1220>He just started a bank.</t1220><t1221>He says that whoever puts in one dollar can take out four dollars at the end of the year.</t1221><t1222>So all the black folks are putting their money in there.</t1222><t1223>But they don't have much anyway.</t1223><t1224>Only the evening is the most.</t1224><t1225>I put in more than four dollars, and I said if it doesn't work out, I'll start my own bank.</t1225><t1226>Of course, that black guy doesn't want me to get involved because he says if there are two banks, there won't be enough to run the business.</t1226><t1227>So he told me I could put in a handful of dollars and by the end of the year, he'd pay me back thirty-five dollars.</t1227>
<t1228>So I put the money in.</t1228> <t1229>I figured that afterward, I would invest those fifteen dollars again to grow the capital even more.</t1229> <t1230>There was another black man named Bob who had just acquired a wooden house that his landlord didn't know about, so I bought it from him and told him that by the end of the year, he would come to collect thirty-five dollars.</t1230> <t1231>But that night, someone had already stolen that house.</t1231> <t1232>The next day, the limping black man came and told me that the bank had also collapsed.</t1232> <t1233>So none of us got our money back.</t1233>
<t1234>- So what did you do with the remaining ten cents, Jim?</t1234>
<t1235>- Well, at that moment I was about to spend those ten cents when I suddenly had a dream, and the dream told me that I should give those ten cents to a black man named Balum Balum, they called him Ass for short. He was one of the very foolish people, you know?</t1235> <t1236>But he often got lucky, they said so, I didn't know.</t1236> <t1237>As for me, I never got lucky.</t1237> <t1238>The dream told me that Balum would take my ten cents to invest and would make me rich.</t1238> <t1239>So I gave the money to Balum.</t1239> <t1240>When he went to church, he heard the pastor say that whoever put money into this box for God would be rewarded a hundredfold by God.</t1240> <t1241>So Balum took out ten cents from his pocket and put it right into the box.</t1241> <t1242>Then he bent down to see if there was anything in the box that would be given back to him.</t1242>
<t1243>- Well, is there anything you can give back?</t1243>
<t1244>- There isn't, I don't see anything at all.</t1244> <t1245>I also don't know how to get that money back anymore.</t1245> <t1246>Balum also gave up.</t1246> <t1247>Well, I won't lend money anymore if I'm not sure.</t1247> <t1248>It will be returned a hundredfold the amount spent!</t1248> <t1249>The pastor said so!</t1249> <t1250>If I get those ten cents back, it's considered even, and that would already be very lucky.</t1250>
<t1251>- Well Jim, it's alright, because there will be times when you'll be rich later on.</t1251>
<t1252>- Yes, now I am rich, come near my house and see.</t1252> <t1253>I already have my own body.</t1253> <t1254>My body is worth eight hundred dollars.</t1254> <t1255>Before, I only wished for money, but now I don't care anymore.</t1255>
<t1256>Chapter IX</t1256>
<t1257>I want to go back and see the place right in the middle of the island that I discovered while exploring.</t1257> <t1258>Both of us went together and found it immediately, because the island is only three miles long and a quarter mile wide.</t1258>
<t1259>This place is a high mound, more than ten meters high, both long and steep.</t1259> <t1260>We climbed to the top of the mound with quite a bit of difficulty, because the slopes on both sides were steep and the bushes were very dense. We had to take each step around the mound, and after a while, we found a large cave in the rock face, extending all the way to the top towards the Illinois shore.</t1260> <t1261>The cave was as wide as two or three rooms combined, and Jim could stand upright in it.</t1261> <t1262>This place is very cold.</t1262> <t1263>Jim wanted to bring our belongings here right away, but I said there was no point in climbing up and down all day.</t1263>
<t1264>Jim said that we had a boat hidden in a secret place, and the belongings were stored in this cave, so if anyone came to the island, we could escape into here.</t1264> <t1265>And if they didn't bring dogs, they wouldn't be able to find us.</t1265> <t1266>Jim also said that the young birds had predicted it was going to rain, so how could we let our belongings get all wet?</t1266>
<t1267>So we returned to the boat, pushed it up to the shore near the cave, and carried all our belongings into the cave.</t1267> <t1268>Then we found a spot nearby to hide the boat, concealing it in a dense willow bush.</t1268> <t1269>We retrieved a few fish from the end of the line, then cast the hook back into the water and began preparing lunch.</t1269>
<t1270>The store is quite spacious, enough to roll a large barrel of wine into it.</t1270> <t1271>On one side of the store, there is a flat protruding piece of land that can be used as a very good kitchen.</t1271> <t1272>We set up the kitchen to cook lunch.</t1272>
<t1273>We spread the blanket inside to use as a mat to sit on and eat.</t1273> <t1274>All the easily accessible items were also kept inside.</t1274> <t1275>A while later, the sky darkened and it began to thunder and lightning; those birds had indeed predicted it accurately.</t1275> <t1276>Immediately, it started to rain heavily, pouring down like a waterfall, and I had never seen the wind blow so fiercely.</t1276> <t1277>It was a typical summer storm.</t1277> <t1278>As the sky grew darker, everything outside took on a beautiful bluish-purple hue.</t1278> <t1279>The rain poured down so heavily that even the tops of the tall trees became indistinct; they looked just like spider webs.</t1279> <t1280>Then, with each gust of wind, those trees were bent over and the pale gray color beneath the branches changed.</t1280> <t1281>Then another, even fiercer gust of wind came, forcing the branches to stretch out like the arms of wild animals.</t1281> <t1282>After that, when everything had turned completely blue and purple, suddenly - oh my; it brightened up, and during that storm, if you looked at the distant treetops, you could see them hundreds of meters farther away than before; then in just a second, it became pitch dark again; at that moment, you could hear the thunder roaring terrifyingly, followed by rumbling sounds gradually descending from above and traveling to the other side of the world, just like the sound of an empty barrel rolling down a long staircase, with the same rumbling noise.</t1282> <t1283>I said:</t1283>
<t1284>- It's so fun, Jim! I just want to stay here and not go anywhere.</t1284> <t1285>Give me a piece of fish and a hot piece of bread.</t1285>
<t1286>- You see, if it weren't for Jim, you wouldn't have come up to this cave, and you would be in that forest with nothing to eat, and you might have drowned too.</t1286> <t1287>Chicks know when it's about to rain, and so do baby birds.</t1287>
<t1288>The river water kept rising, continuously for ten to twelve days, overflowing onto the banks.</t1288> <t1289>The water flooded the island, reaching over a meter in low areas and at the head of the island towards the Illinois shore.</t1289> <t1290>On that side, the island was several miles wide, but on the Missouri side, it was about half a mile because the Missouri shore was like a large vertical wall.</t1290>
<t1291>During the day, we could paddle the boat all around the island.</t1291> <t1292>The weather was quite cold.</t1292> <t1293>In the deep forest, it was even darker, although it was still sunny outside.</t1293> <t1294>We maneuvered the boat between the tree trunks.</t1294> <t1295>In many places, grapevines hung down, obstructing the way, so we had to turn back and find another route.</t1295> <t1296>In places where fallen trees lay, there could be rabbits, snakes, and other animals.</t1296> <t1297>Whenever the island was flooded for a few days, those animals became very tame because they were too hungry.</t1297> <t1298>At that time, you could paddle the boat right up to them and catch them with your hand.</t1298> <t1299>But with snakes and turtles, it wasn't possible because they would dive to the bottom of the water.</t1299> <t1300>In one spot in the cave, we also had many of these creatures, and if we wanted to catch and raise them, we could get plenty.</t1300>
<t1301>One night we salvaged an entire section of a wooden raft, made entirely of pine planks.</t1301> <t1302>It was three meters wide, four to five meters long, and up to twenty centimeters thick.</t1302> <t1303>This wood is very sturdy for flooring.</t1303> <t1304>During the day, we also saw many pieces of wood that had been sawed off floating by, but we let them drift away; because during the day we didn't dare to go outside.</t1304>
<t1305>One night, when we reached the edge of the island near dawn, we saw an entire wooden house from upstream drifting to the western shore. The house had an attic; it was tilted and about to collapse.</t1305> <t1306>We rowed the boat out, jumped on, and climbed through the attic window to get inside.</t1306> <t1307>We then tied the boat to it and sat waiting for daylight.</t1307>
<t1308>The house drifted to the head of the island as the sky began to lighten.</t1308> <t1309>From outside the window, we looked in and saw a bed, a table, two old chairs, and on the attic floor, there were many other things; clothes were also hanging on the wall.</t1309> <t1310>There was something lying on the floor in the corner of the house that looked like a person.</t1310> <t1311>Jim called out:</t1311>
<t1312>- Hey! Hey!</t1312>
<t1313>There was no movement.</t1313> <t1314>I called again.</t1314> <t1315>Then Jim said:</t1315>
<t1316>- This person is not sleeping, but dead. You stay here, let me go in and check.</t1316>
<t1317>Jim walked in, bent down to look, and then said:</t1317>
<t1318>- One person is dead.</t1318> <t1319>That's right, and they are naked too.</t1319> <t1320>They were shot in the back.</t1320> <t1321>I'm sure they've been dead for two or three days now.</t1321> <t1322>Come in, Huck, but don't look at their face, it's got many cuts, very gruesome.</t1322>
<t1323>I didn't dare to look.</t1323> <t1324>Jim threw the torn clothes over the dead body.</t1324> <t1325>But why did he have to do that? I didn't want to see the dead body anyway.</t1325> <t1326>There was a pile of old, dirty cards scattered on the floor, some whiskey bottles, a few masks made of black cloth; and on the walls, there were scribbles and poorly written words drawn with charcoal everywhere.</t1326> <t1327>There were two old thick fabric shirts, a sun hat, some women's underwear hanging on the wall, and some men's pants too.</t1327> <t1328>We picked them all up and put them in the boat to use later.</t1328> <t1329>There was also a child's hat on the floor, which I picked up as well.</t1329>
<t1330>Then there was a bottle of milk with some milk left in it, and a torn rubber baby bottle nipple.</t1330> <t1331>We intended to take the bottle of milk but it was already spoiled.</t1331> <t1332>There was an old, tattered trunk and a woven hair chest with broken hinges.</t1332> <t1333>Both were wide open, but inside there was nothing of value.</t1333> <t1334>From the way the furniture was scattered around, we guessed that someone had fled in a hurry and didn't have the presence of mind to take everything with them.</t1334>
<t1335>We found an old iron lamp, a meat cleaver without a handle, and a new Barlow-style dagger, which would cost at least two dimes at any store; along with a bunch of tallow candles, an iron candlestick; an iron cup, then a blanket still usable but gnawed by mice, a small bag for sewing supplies complete with waxed needles, a hook as small as my little finger but with large hooks, a roll of buckskin, a dog collar, a horseshoe, and some bottles of medicine without any labels.</t1335> <t1336>Just as we were about to leave, we found a fairly good horse brush.</t1336> <t1337>Jim also picked up an old, broken woman's comb and a wooden leg.</t1337> <t1338>The leather straps were all broken, but if tied back together, they were still usable, although they were too long for me and a bit short for Jim.</t1338> <t1339>After searching around, we couldn't find the other leg.</t1339>
<t1340>So we made a big haul and carried everything away.</t1340> <t1341>As we were about to leave the house, we realized we had drifted a quarter of a mile downstream from the island, and it was already daylight, so I told Jim to lie down in the boat and cover himself with a blanket.</t1341> <t1342>Because if Jim sat up, people would immediately recognize him as a runaway black man.</t1342> <t1343>I rowed the boat towards the Illinois shore, drifting another half mile further.</t1343> <t1344>When we reached calm waters, I started rowing back upstream.</t1344> <t1345>Nothing happened and there was no one around.</t1345> <t1346>We returned home safely.</t1346>
<t1347>Chapter X</t1347>
<t1348>After finishing breakfast, I wanted to talk about the dead person in that floating house and guess why they were killed.</t1348> <t1349>But Jim didn't like talking about it.</t1349> <t1350>Jim said talking about it would bring bad luck, and moreover, the dead person might come back.</t1350> <t1351>Jim said that the dead who are not buried tend to come back more often than those who are properly buried.</t1351> <t1352>That made sense, so I didn't say anything more; but I couldn't stop thinking about it, wanting to know who shot that person and why?</t1352>
<t1353>We rummaged through the clothes we brought back and found eight silver dollars sewn into the hem of an outer garment.</t1353> <t1354>Jim said that perhaps the person in that house stole the garment, because if they knew there was money, they wouldn't have left it behind.</t1354> <t1355>I said maybe they were hiding that person here, but Jim still didn't want to talk about it.</t1355> <t1356>I said:</t1356>
<t1357>- You said it was bad luck; so what do you say about me finding a snake skin on top of the hill the day before yesterday?</t1357> <t1358>Didn't you say that touching a snake skin would bring the worst luck in the world? Well, here's the bad luck; we found so many things, and even got eight dollars.</t1358> <t1359>I wish we could have this kind of bad luck every day, Jim</t1359><t1360>!</t1360>
<t1361>- Don't think so, my friend, don't think so.</t1361> <t1362>Don't celebrate too soon.</t1362> <t1363>You will see.</t1363> <t1364>Remember, you will see, I'm telling you the truth.</t1364>
<t1365>Indeed, the misfortune really came.</t1365> <t1366>We talked about that story on the third day.</t1366> <t1367>Then on the sixth day, after dinner, we were lying on the grass on the hilltop, and having run out of cigarettes, I went back to the cave to get some and suddenly saw a snake lying there.</t1367> <t1368>I killed the snake immediately, but I coiled it up and threw it under the blanket where Jim was lying.</t1368> <t1369>It was just a prank, thinking that Jim would be scared when he unexpectedly saw it, and I would get a good laugh.</t1369> <t1370>But at night, I had forgotten about the snake, and just as Jim crawled into the blanket and I lit the lamp, the female snake, which had been there for some time, bit Jim immediately.</t1370>
<t1371>Jim jumped up and screamed, I shone the light and saw the female snake coiling up, ready to strike again.</t1371><t1372>I grabbed a stick and struck it dead with one blow, while Jim grabbed my father's whiskey bottle and poured it down his throat.</t1372><t1373>Jim was barefoot, and the snake had bitten him right on the heel. I realized how foolish I was for not remembering that after killing one snake and leaving it there, its mate would come and coil up beside it.</t1373><t1374>Jim told me to cut off the snake's head and throw it far away, then skin it and roast a piece, saying that would neutralize the venom.</t1374><t1375>He also told me to take the rings from the tails of both snakes and tie them around my wrist.</t1375><t1376>Jim said that would make everything alright.</t1376><t1377>Then he quietly went outside, threw the bodies of the two snakes far into the bushes; because I wasn't foolish enough to play with them.</t1377>
<t1378>Jim gulped down the liquor, gulped it down again, occasionally stretching his neck, shaking his head, and howling; but after each time returning to normal, he would gulp down the liquor again.</t1378> <t1379>Jim's foot swelled up very quickly, then his calf too.</t1379> <t1380>Gradually the liquor took effect and I thought Jim would be fine.</t1380> <t1381>But I also thought that being bitten by a snake would be better than gulping down my father's whiskey.</t1381>
<t1382>Jim lay bedridden for four days and nights.</t1382> <t1383>Then the swelling disappeared and Jim was able to walk again.</t1383> <t1384>I thought to myself that from now on, I would definitely not touch the shed snake skin anymore, because I had seen how harmful it could be.</t1384> <t1385>Jim said that he hoped I would believe him from now on.</t1385> <t1386>Then he reiterated that touching the shed snake skin was extremely unlucky, and perhaps we hadn't yet realized how harmful it could be.</t1386> <t1387>Jim said he would rather glance at the crescent moon over his left shoulder a thousand times than hold the shed snake skin in his hand.</t1387> <t1388>I felt the same way, because I also understood that looking at the crescent moon over one's left shoulder was one of the most careless and foolish things that no one ever did.</t1388> <t1389>Old man Huck Bunker once did that and kept boasting about it.</t1389> <t1390>Yet, in less than twenty years, he got drunk and fell from a high platform to the ground, lying flat like a log used to wedge a tree stump, so to speak; then they had to carry him through the window to put him in a coffin for burial.</t1390> <t1391>That's what they said, I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.</t1391> <t1392>My father said so too.</t1392> <t1393>Anyway, it was because the old man dared to look at the moon in such a way. Truly foolish.</t1393>
<t1394>Day by day, the river water receded and lay between the two banks.</t1394> <t1395>The first thing we did was bait a big hook with a skinned rabbit.</t1395> <t1396>We cast the bait and caught a giant fish as big as a person, nearly two meters long and weighing almost a hundred pounds.</t1396> <t1397>We couldn't pull the fish up, and who knows, it might have dragged us all the way to Illinois.</t1397> <t1398>We had no choice but to leave it there and watch it thrash until it died.</t1398> <t1399>We found a bronze frame inside the fish's belly, with a ball inside, which contained a spool of wire.</t1399> <t1400>Jim said that it had been inside the ball all along, and they wrapped it outside to make the ball.</t1400> <t1401>I'm sure this is the biggest fish I've ever seen; I've never seen a fish bigger than this.</t1401> <t1402>If it were in the village, it would have sold for a lot of money.</t1402> <t1403>With a fish like this, they would cut it into many small pieces, each half a pound, and sell them at the market; everyone would want to buy a few pieces. Its meat is as white as snow and smells delicious when fried.</t1403>
<t1404>The next morning, I told Jim that I felt sad and tired, so I wanted to find some way to be a bit more active.</t1404> <t1405>I planned to go out to the river to see if there was anything there.</t1405> <t1406>Jim agreed, but told me to wait until evening to go and to be careful.</t1406> <t1407>He thought for a moment and then suggested that I should take off the old clothes I was wearing and disguise myself as a girl. That idea sounded good.</t1407> <t1408>So we took a short-cut dress, rolled up my pants to the knees, and then put the dress on.</t1408> <t1409>Jim used a fishhook to gather the back of the dress, making it look quite nice.</t1409> <t1410>I put on a wide-brimmed hat and tied the hat's string under my chin.</t1410> <t1411>If anyone wanted to look closely and see my face, they would have to bend down as if looking into a stove chimney.</t1411> <t1412>Jim said that no one would recognize me, even in broad daylight; it would be very hard to recognize me.</t1412> <t1413>All day long, I practiced walking to get used to it, and gradually I felt quite comfortable in that outfit; but Jim told me that my walk still didn't look like a girl's walk and that I should stop lifting the dress to put my hands in my pants pockets.</t1413> <t1414>I followed his advice and imitated more accurately.</t1414>
<t1415>It was just getting dark when I rowed the boat up to the Illinois shore.</t1415>
<t1416>I went past the provincial area, down at the ferry dock a distance, the current carried my boat to the end of the province.</t1416> <t1417>I got off the boat and walked along the foot of the dyke.</t1417> <t1418>There was a light in a small hut that seemed to have been unoccupied for a long time. I was curious to know who had come to stay here.</t1418> <t1419>I cautiously approached and peeked through a crack in the window.</t1419> <t1420>Inside the hut, a woman about forty years old was sitting by a candle placed on a pinewood table.</t1420> <t1421>I did not recognize her face; she must have been new here because in this province there was no one whose face I did not know.</t1421> <t1422>This was fortunate; earlier I had been worried that someone might recognize my voice and discover who I was.</t1422> <t1423>But if that woman had been in this small province for two days, she might be able to tell me everything I wanted to know.</t1423>
<t1424>Thinking that, I knocked on the door and reminded myself not to forget that I was pretending to be a daughter.</t1424>
<t1425>Chapter XI</t1425>
<t1426>The woman said:</t1426>
<t1427>- Come in.</t1427>
<t1428>I walked in.</t1428> <t1429>She said:</t1429>
<t1430>- Sit down here.</t1430>
<t1431>I sat down.</t1431> <t1432>She looked me over with small but very bright eyes, then asked:</t1432>
<t1433>- What is your name?</t1433>
<t1434>- Sara Willim</t1434>
<t1435>- Where are you? Is it nearby?</t1435>
<t1436>- No, I live in Hookerville, seven miles down from here.</t1436> <t1437>I walked all the way up here, and now I'm tired.</t1437>
<t1438>- Surely, you must be hungry, right? Let me find something for you to eat.</t1438>
<t1439>- No, I'm not hungry.</t1439> <t1440>Earlier, I stopped at a camp two miles from here; I was hungry then, but now I'm not hungry anymore.</t1440> <t1441>That's why I'm walking slowly.</t1441> <t1442>My mother is seriously ill, we have no money and nothing left.</t1442> <t1443>I'm going to find and inform my uncle, Abner Moore.</t1443> <t1444>My mother said my uncle is at the lower end of the province over there.</t1444> <t1445>I've never been to this place before.</t1445> <t1446>Do you know my uncle?</t1446>
<t1447>- No, I don't know anyone yet.</t1447> <t1448>I've only been here for less than two weeks.</t1448> <t1449>From here to the end of the province, there are many dirt roads.</t1449> <t1450>You should stay here tonight.</t1450> <t1451>Take off your hat first.</t1451>
<t1452>- No, I replied.</t1452> <t1453>No, I'm just resting here for a moment and then I'll go right away, I'm not afraid of the dark at all.</t1453>
<t1454>She said she wouldn't let me go alone.</t1454> <t1455>Her husband was coming back in about an hour and a half, and she would ask him to go with me.</t1455> <t1456>Then she went on about her husband, and the familiar people at the river's beginning and end, about how happy things were in the old place, and how coming to this province without knowing was so long and tedious, that it would have been better to stay alone - and so on, and so on...</t1456> <t1457>To the point that I became scared because I had foolishly come here to ask her about things in the province.</t1457> <t1458>But then a moment later, she started talking about my father and the murder case.</t1458> <t1459>I wanted to just let her talk and listen.</t1459> <t1460>She talked about how Tom Sawyer and I earned twelve thousand dollars (she said twenty thousand), and everything about my father, saying my father was very stubborn, and I was very stubborn too.</t1460> <t1461>Then finally, she talked about the part where I was killed.</t1461> <t1462>I asked:</t1462>
<t1463>- Who killed him? I heard people talking a lot about it in Hookerville, but I don't know who killed Huck Finn.</t1463>
<t1464>- I think the people here really have many special qualities.</t1464> <t1465>Even I want to know who killed Huck Finn.</t1465>
<t1466>- No! Really, ma'am?</t1466>
<t1467>- At first, almost everyone thought so.</t1467> <t1468>But then by the afternoon, people changed their minds and said that it was a runaway black man named Jim who killed Huck Finn.</t1468>
<t1469>Oh no - he...</t1469>
<t1470>I immediately fell silent.</t1470> <t1471>I thought that it was better to just sit quietly.</t1471> <t1472>She continued speaking, ignoring the sentence I had just interjected.</t1472>
<t1473>- The black man escaped on the very night Huck Finn was killed.</t1473> <t1474>They offered a reward to catch him: three hundred dollars.</t1474> <t1475>Then they also offered a reward to catch Finn's father: two hundred dollars.</t1475> <t1476>You know, he went to town the morning after the murder happened; he told the story and then went with them on the boat to search for the body.</t1476> <t1477>Then right after that, he also escaped.</t1477> <t1478>In the evening, they intended to put him on trial, but he had already escaped.</t1478> <t1479>The next day, the black man escaped again.</t1479> <t1480>They said they saw him at ten o'clock on the night of the murder.</t1480> <t1481>So they accused him, you know.</t1481> <t1482>After they were sure of it, the next day Finn's father came back, crying loudly, demanding Judge Thatcher to spend money to hunt the black man all over Illinois.</t1482> <t1483>The judge gave some money, and in the evening, Finn's father got drunk and lingered until midnight with two very ugly strangers, then left with them.</t1483> <t1484>Since then, he hasn't returned, and people haven't bothered to look for him.</t1484> <t1485>It's considered over now; but some people think that Finn's father killed his son and arranged things to make it look like a robbery, so he could take Huck's money without worrying about being sued.</t1485> <t1486>They said what he did wasn't right. Oh, but I think he was very clever.</t1486> <t1487>If he doesn't return within a year, then it's all settled.</t1487> <t1488>There's no evidence to accuse him, you understand.</t1488> <t1489>So at that point, everything will be fine, and he can easily spend Huck's money without any trouble.</t1489>
<t1490>- Yes, I think so too, grandma. I don't see anything difficult about that.</t1490> <t1491>So now no one thinks that the black man did it anymore?</t1491>
<t1492>- Oh no, not everyone.</t1492> <t1493>Many people still think the black man did it.</t1493> <t1494>But soon they will catch the black man, and perhaps they will still suspect him a lot.</t1494>
<t1495>- So, are they still looking to catch him?</t1495>
<t1496>- Oh, how naive you are, child.</t1496> <t1497>It's not every day that people can easily earn three hundred dollars.</t1497> <t1498>Some people think that the black man hasn't fled far from here.</t1498> <t1499>I think so too, but I haven't told anyone.</t1499> <t1500>A few days ago, I talked to an old couple in the wooden house next door, and they said that few people go to that distant island called Jackson Island.</t1500> <t1501>I asked if there was anyone on that island.</t1501> <t1502>They said: no, there's no one there at all.</t1502> <t1503>I didn't say anything more, but I kept thinking about it.</t1503> <t1504>Since I live nearby, I'm sure I saw smoke rising from that direction, from the head of that island, a few days ago.</t1504> <t1505>I wondered if the black man might be hiding on the island.</t1505> <t1506>I said that anyway, it would be worth the effort to go to that island and search it.</t1506> <t1507>Since that day, I haven't seen any more smoke, so I think if there was a black man, he must have left by now.</t1507> <t1508>But my husband will go up there to check, along with another person.</t1508> <t1509>He went upriver and just returned today.</t1509> <t1510>Two hours ago, as soon as he stepped into the house, I told him about it.</t1510>
<t1511>At this moment, I was extremely confused, unable to sit still any longer.</t1511> <t1512>I had to move my hands a bit, so I picked up the sewing needle on the table and threaded it.</t1512> <t1513>My hands were trembling, and I couldn't thread it.</t1513> <t1514>The woman stopped talking, looked up, and gazed at me with a somewhat strange expression, then smiled.</t1514> <t1515>I put the needle and thread down, pretending to be interested in the story as well, and said:</t1515>
<t1516>- Three hundred dollars, that's a lot of money.</t1516> <t1517>I also hope my mother can get such an amount.</t1517> <t1518>Is your husband going to that island tonight?</t1518>
<t1519>- Oh, yes.</t1519> <t1520>He is going to town with the people I just mentioned to get a boat and see if he can borrow a gun.</t1520> <t1521>Around midnight, they will leave.</t1521>
<t1522>- Why not wait until daytime when it's clearer to see?</t1522>
<t1523>- Yes, but during the day the black man can also see us more easily.</t1523> <t1524>After midnight, the black man might be fast asleep, so you can sneak through the forest, and if he lights a fire in the dark, it will be easier to find him.</t1524>
<t1525>- It's not that certain.</t1525>
<t1526>The woman looked at me with a tattletale expression, making me even more uneasy.</t1526> <t1527>She asked:</t1527>
<t1528>- Earlier, what did you say your name was?</t1528>
<t1529>- M - Mary William</t1529>
<t1530>Strange, didn't I just say it was Mary?</t1530> <t1531>Thinking that, but I didn't look up.</t1531> <t1532>It seems like I said it was Sara earlier.</t1532> <t1533>I felt like I was being cornered, so scared that I didn't dare to look up anymore.</t1533> <t1534>The quieter she was, the more confused I felt.</t1534> <t1535>But then she asked:</t1535>
<t1536>- I thought you said it was Sara when you first came in?</t1536>
<t1537>- Yes, that's right.</t1537> <t1538>Sara Mary William, Sara is my first name.</t1538> <t1539>Some people call me Sara, some people call me Mary.</t1539>
<t1540>- Oh, really?</t1540>
<t1541>I feel more at ease now.</t1541> <t1542>But I still hope I don't have to sit there anymore.</t1542>
<t1543>I still can't look up.</t1543>
<t1544>But then she started talking about how hard and poor life was, and how here the mice ran in and out freely as if they owned the house, and so on...</t1544> <t1545>At that moment, I felt more at ease, and she immediately started talking about the mice.</t1545> <t1546>Every now and then, a mouse would poke its snout out of a hole in the corner of the house.</t1546> <t1547>She said that one must always hold something in hand to throw at the mice whenever alone at home.</t1547> <t1548>Otherwise, the mice wouldn't let you sit still.</t1548> <t1549>She showed me a twisted piece of lead, like a knot, and said it was very good for throwing at mice.</t1549> <t1550>But just a few days ago, she sprained her hand while keeping an eye out, then suddenly threw it, but it was still far from the mouse.</t1550> <t1551>She cried out in pain; and her hand hurt again.</t1551> <t1552>Then she asked me to try throwing at the next mouse.</t1552> <t1553>I wanted to leave before her husband came home, but somehow I couldn't.</t1553> <t1554>I grabbed the piece of lead, waited for another mouse to poke its snout out, and threw it recklessly.</t1554> <t1555>The lead hit the mouse, and it fell over, hitting a thin mouse.</t1555> <t1556>She said I was really good, and thought I would throw at the next one too.</t1556> <t1557>She picked up the piece of lead, then brought a spool of thread and asked me to help untangle it.</t1557> <t1558>I held out my hands, she placed the spool of thread in them, and continued talking about her and her husband.</t1558> <t1559>But then she fell silent and said:</t1559>
<t1560>- Keep an eye on the mouse.</t1560> <t1561>Just hold the lead bar in your hand.</t1561>
<t1562>She dropped the lead ingot into the hem of my skirt just as I closed my legs to hold the ingot in place.</t1562> <t1563>She started talking again.</t1563> <t1564>But only for a moment.</t1564> <t1565>Then she lifted the spool, looked straight at my face with a playful expression, and asked:</t1565>
<t1566>- Hey, tell me the truth, what is your name?</t1566>
<t1567>- What did you say?</t1567>
<t1568>- What is your real name? Is it Bin, Tom, or Bob? Or what is it?</t1568>
<t1569>I thought I was trembling like a leaf, and truly didn't know what to do.</t1569> <t1570>But I replied:</t1570>
<t1571>- Please don't tease a miserable girl like me.</t1571> <t1572>If my sitting here bothers you, then I apologize...</t1572>
<t1573>- No, no, don't go anywhere.</t1573> <t1574>Just sit still here.</t1574> <t1575>I won't harm you, and I won't tell anyone about you, trust me, tell me the truth.</t1575> <t1576>I will keep it a secret for you, I will help you.</t1576> <t1577>I will even tell my husband to keep it a secret for you, if you want.</t1577> <t1578>Do you understand, you are just a naive young horse that ran away from the herd, nothing more.</t1578> <t1579>But it's okay, you were treated harshly so you decided to run away, right?</t1579> <t1580>It's so pitiful, I won't tell anyone about you.</t1580> <t1581>Now tell me everything, come on, good boy.</t1581>
<t1582>I thought to myself that continuing to act would be futile, so I decided to confess to her and tell her everything, but she must keep her promise.</t1582> <t1583>Then I told her that both my parents had died, and the law had forced me to live with an old and cruel landlord in a place thirty miles away from the river.</t1583> <t1584>They treated me so badly that I couldn't stay there any longer.</t1584> <t1585>Taking advantage of the landlord's absence for a few days, I seized the opportunity to escape and stole some clothes from his daughter, traveling for three nights straight until I arrived here.</t1585> <t1586>I traveled by night and hid somewhere to sleep during the day.</t1586> <t1587>The bundle of bread and meat I brought was just enough to eat along the way.</t1587> <t1588>I also said that I believed my uncle, Abner Moore, would take care of me, which is why I made my way to this Goshen area.</t1588>
<t1589>- Goshen, where are you, boy! This is not Goshen, this is Petersburg. Goshen is still ten miles up the river.</t1589> <t1590>Who told you this was Goshen?</t1590>
<t1591>- Really? But there was a person I met at dawn today, when I was about to turn into the forest to sleep, who told me to turn right at the fork, then go five more miles to reach Goshen.</t1591>
<t1592>- He must be drunk.</t1592> <t1593>What he said is completely wrong.</t1593>
<t1594>- Yes, he does look drunk.</t1594> <t1595>But well, there's nothing we can do about it now.</t1595> <t1596>I have to travel a bit further.</t1596> <t1597>I'll reach Goshen before dawn.</t1597>
<t1598>- Wait a moment, let me get you something to eat quickly.</t1598> <t1599>You must be hungry.</t1599>
<t1600>She gave me food and then asked:</t1600>
<t1601>- Hey, when a cow is lying on the ground, which end does it stand up from first?</t1601> <t1602>Answer immediately, no thinking allowed.</t1602> <t1603>Which end stands up first?</t1603>
<t1604>- The tail end</t1604>
<t1605>- So, which side of the tree does moss grow on?</t1605>
<t1606>- The north</t1606>
<t1607>- If fifteen cows graze on the hill, how many face the same direction?</t1607>
<t1608>- All fifteen of them</t1608>
<t1609>- Alright, so I know you were in the countryside.</t1609> <t1610>I thought you were going to trick me again.</t1610> <t1611>So what's your real name now?</t1611>
<t1612>- George Peter is old.</t1612>
<t1613>- Alright, remember this, George.</t1613> <t1614>Before you go, make sure to tell me that you are Alexander, and then when you are outside, say that I caught you and that you are George Alexander.</t1614> <t1615>And don't wear those old clothes when you go to places with women.</t1615> <t1616>You can pretend to be a poor girl, but men will still notice.</t1616> <t1617>Poor you, whenever you thread a needle, don't hold the needle still and then thread it; women always do that, but men do it differently.</t1617> <t1618>And whenever you throw a mouse or anything else, remember to stand on tiptoe a bit, raise your hand over your head to look very awkward, and throw it a few feet away from the mouse.</t1618> <t1619>You have to throw in a way that looks stiff all the way from the shoulder down, as if there's a pin in your shoulder that rotates your arm, so it looks like a girl, not throwing with your wrist or elbow and spreading your arm out to one side like a boy.</t1619> <t1620>And also remember that when a girl moves, she spreads her knees apart, not keeping them together like you did earlier to hold the lead piece.</t1620> <t1621>It's no wonder, from the moment you threaded the needle, I knew you were a boy, so I tested that to be sure.</t1621> <t1622>Now, go find your uncle, Sara Mary William George Alexander Peter.</t1622> <t1623>If you run into any trouble, send word to me, Mrs. Judith Loftus.</t1623> <t1624>I'll do whatever I can to help you.</t1624> <t1625>Follow the river path, and next time you walk such a long distance, wear shoes and socks. The river path is full of pebbles; by the time you get to Goshen, your feet will hurt a lot.</t1625>
<t1626>I walked upstream about fifty meters and then turned back, rushing to the place where the boat was, a distance below that house.</t1626> <t1627>I jumped into the boat, hurriedly rowing away.</t1627> <t1628>I went quite far upstream, all the way to the head of the island, then veered across.</t1628> <t1629>I took off my hat, as there was no need to disguise anymore.</t1629> <t1630>Earlier, when I was halfway there, I heard the bell ringing, faintly over the water but still clear, it was eleven o'clock.</t1630> <t1631>At the head of the island, even though the wind was blowing strong, I didn't need to take cover anymore but headed straight for the spot with the log where I had hidden when I first arrived and had once lit a fire in a dry place.</t1631> <t1632>I rowed hard to the place where we stayed, more than a mile downstream.</t1632> <t1633>Then I went ashore, leaped over the log, climbed up the mound, and rushed into the cave.</t1633> <t1634>Jim was lying there, fast asleep on the ground.</t1634> <t1635>I shook him awake and said:</t1635>
<t1636>- Wake up, Jim, we're doomed.</t1636> <t1637>We can't afford to be late by even a minute.</t1637> <t1638>They're hunting us down!</t1638>
<t1639>Jim didn't ask anything nor did he say anything, but just by looking at his hasty manner for about half an hour, one could tell he was very scared.</t1639> <t1640>When the raft was ready to leave the willow thicket, where we had been hiding it.</t1640> <t1641>The first thing we did was extinguish the fire in the cave, and after that, we didn't light any candles either.</t1641>
<t1642>I took the boat out a bit from the shore to scout ahead.</t1642> <t1643>But even if there was a boat right there, nothing could be seen because it was pitch dark, with only starlight, nothing visible.</t1643> <t1644>Then we pushed the raft out, letting it glide down the river, through the darkness past the other end of the island, silent as death, no one uttering a word.</t1644>
<t1645>Chapter XII</t1645>
<t1646>It was probably close to one in the morning when we finally reached the area below the island.</t1646> <t1647>It seemed like our raft was moving incredibly slowly.</t1647> <t1648>If any boat or ship had come by, we would have had to jump into the canoe and make a run for the Illinois shore immediately.</t1648> <t1649>But luckily, no boats came by, and we didn't think to put the gun, the fishing rod, or any food into the canoe either.</t1649> <t1650>At that moment, we were in such a rush, panicking, and didn't think everything through.</t1650> <t1651>Besides, putting everything onto the raft wouldn't have been practical.</t1651>
<t1652>If those two people come to the island, I'm sure they will see our campfire and wait there all night for Jim to come.</t1652> <t1653>Anyway, they are still farther from our place, and if our fire deceives them, it's not my fault.</t1653> <t1654>But the more we can trick them, the better.</t1654>
<t1655>When the first light of day appeared, we tied the raft to a crevice near a large beach on the Illinois side; using an axe, we cut some cottonwood branches to cover it, making it look as if there had long been a recess at this part of the riverbank.</t1655> <t1656>At the front was a sandbar, with dense cottonwood trees growing thickly like the teeth of a comb.</t1656>
<t1657>On the Illinois side, there are mountains.</t1657> <t1658>On the Illinois side, there are only big trees.</t1658> <t1659>This stretch of the river has a creek flowing towards the Illinois side, so we weren't afraid of anyone passing by here.</t1659> <t1660>We lay there all day, watching the rafts and steamboats going down the Illinois side, and the boats going upstream roaring in the middle of the river.</t1660> <t1661>I told Jim about the time I sat chatting with that woman, and Jim said she was a strange woman; if she had been the one hunting us, she wouldn't have bothered sitting by the campfire, but instead, sir, she would have led the hunt herself.</t1661> <t1662>I asked why she didn't suggest her husband bring the dogs. Jim said he guessed she had thought of that when her husband was about to leave, and probably the man went to town to get the dogs, which took so much time.</t1662> <t1663>That's why we could run to this place, sixteen or seventeen miles away from the village; otherwise, we would still be stuck in that old town.</t1663> <t1664>I think as long as they haven't caught us, it doesn't matter why they haven't caught us yet.</t1664>
<t1665>It started to get dark, so we poked our heads out from the pile of cotton, looked around, and saw nothing.</t1665> <t1666>Then Jim lifted the planks on the raft and set them up into a tent so we could crawl into it when it rained or shone, and to keep our belongings from getting wet.</t1666> <t1667>Jim also built an additional wooden platform about thirty centimeters high on the outside so that when large waves from passing ships hit, they wouldn't splash onto our belongings.</t1667> <t1668>In the middle of the tent, we made a small depression, filled it with soil about a decimeter deep, and surrounded it with wood to make a fireplace for when it rained and got cold, and also to keep it inside the tent so people wouldn't see it.</t1668> <t1669>We erected a short stick with a notch at the top to hang an old lantern on whenever a ship was passing downstream, to avoid collisions.</t1669> <t1670>As for the boats going upstream, we didn't need to light the lantern unless we were crossing the river; because the surface water flowed quite strongly, and there were many hidden sandbars below, so upstream boats often didn't travel in the middle of the river but chose spots where the current was less strong.</t1670>
<t1671>On the second night, we traveled for about seven or eight hours, on the fast-flowing water that moved at four miles per hour.</t1671> <t1672>We caught fish, chatted, and occasionally jumped into the water for a quick swim to stay awake.</t1672> <t1673>Traveling on this large and quiet river felt solemn somehow.</t1673> <t1674>We lay on our backs looking at the stars in the sky, never daring to speak loudly, and rarely laughed.</t1674> <t1675>We just kept our mouths shut, making a few puffing sounds.</t1675> <t1676>Overall, the weather was very nice; that night, the next night, and the night after that, nothing happened.</t1676>
<t1677>Every night we passed through places with towns, sometimes the town was on a distant hillside, only visible as a long streak of light without clear sight of the houses.</t1677> <t1678>On the fifth night, we passed through St. Louis, which looked like an entire world lit up. In Petersburg, they always said that St. Louis had up to twenty or thirty thousand people, but I didn't believe it until we passed by at two in the morning and saw such brilliant lights, then I believed it was true.</t1678> <t1679>Inside the city, there was not a sound, everyone had gone to sleep.</t1679>
<t1680>Every night, I usually go ashore at ten o'clock, go to a small village to buy ten or fifteen cents worth of bread or meat or something to eat, sometimes I catch and bring back a chicken that refuses to stay in its coop.</t1680> <t1681>My father used to say that whenever there was a chance to catch a chicken, just catch it, because that way you never forget an act of kindness.</t1681> <t1682>I've never actually seen my father not care about chickens, but he always said that.</t1682>
<t1683>There were times when, at the break of dawn, I would sneak into the fields to borrow a melon or a pumpkin, or some corn or sweet potatoes.</t1683> <t1684>My father often said that borrowing something from someone with the intention of returning it later is not a bad thing.</t1684> <t1685>But the widow said that it was nothing more than a euphemism for stealing, and respectable people don't do such things.</t1685> <t1686>Jim thought that both the widow and my father were somewhat right.</t1686> <t1687>So, it was better to take a few things and then tell them that we wouldn't take anything next time.</t1687> <t1688>And Jim thought that doing so would make it okay to borrow other things in the future.</t1688> <t1689>So we discussed whether to take melons, pumpkins, or other things.</t1689> <t1690>But by morning, we resolved the matter and decided to take wild apples and wild pears.</t1690> <t1691>Before that, we were worried that we were doing something wrong, but now we felt at ease.</t1691> <t1692>Personally, I was also satisfied with this resolution, partly because wild apples weren't very tasty, and wild pears wouldn't ripen for another few months.</t1692>
<t1693>Occasionally, we would shoot a lone animal that was out foraging early in the morning or late at night before it had found a place to sleep.</t1693> <t1694>At those times, our life became quite lively.</t1694>
<t1695>By Thursday, down below St Louis, we encountered a big storm around past midnight, with thunder rumbling and rain pouring down heavily.</t1695> <t1696>We crawled into the tent and let the raft drift.</t1696> <t1697>When the lightning flashed, we could see a vast stretch of river and high rocky cliffs on both sides.</t1697> <t1698>Suddenly I called out: Jim, look over there.</t1698> <t1699>It was a steamboat that had crashed into a rocky outcrop.</t1699> <t1700>We steered the raft directly to the spot.</t1700> <t1701>The lightning lit up everything clearly.</t1701> <t1702>The boat was leaning over, with part of its bow already submerged.</t1702> <t1703>Each time the lightning flashed, we could see every small column gleaming, a chair in the pilot's cabin with a hat hanging behind it.</t1703>
<t1704>On a stormy night like this, going far from home, everything seems so mysterious; I think any other kid would feel the same as I did when seeing the wrecked ship lying there, as sad as death in the middle of the river.</t1704> <t1705>I wanted to climb up the wrecked ship to look around a bit to see if there was anything.</t1705> <t1706>I said.</t1706>
<t1707>- Climb up, Jim</t1707>
<t1708>At first, Jim remained silent and said nothing, but then he replied:</t1708>
<t1709>- I'm not climbing onto that wrecked ship.</t1709> <t1710>We've already committed a sin, so it's better not to commit another, as the book says.</t1710> <t1711>What if there's a guard on that ship?</t1711>
<t1712>I said:</t1712>
<t1713>- What watch? There's no watch, nobody is guarding anything here. Do you think anyone is foolish enough to stay here and guard the engine room and the cockpit on a stormy night like this, especially when we don't know when the ship will break apart and sink to the bottom of the river.</t1713>
<t1714>Jim didn't know what to say, so he gave up.</t1714> <t1715>I continued:</t1715>
<t1716>- Besides, we can temporarily borrow something valuable from the captain's cabin.</t1716> <t1717>Cigars, you know, each cigar is worth five cents, definitely.</t1717> <t1718>Captains on riverboats are always rich, earning up to sixty dollars a month, and they never hesitate to buy whatever they want.</t1718> <t1719>Take a candle out of the bag, Jim, I can't sit still until we've rummaged through there.</t1719> <t1720>Do you think if Tom Sawyer were here he would sit still?</t1720> <t1721>No way, I bet you he wouldn't.</t1721> <t1722>He would call this an adventure, that's right; and eventually, he would have to climb up to that wrecked ship.</t1722> <t1723>And wouldn't he add all sorts of thrilling stories, make up all kinds of things?</t1723> <t1724>Just go up and see, Jim, and you'll feel like Columbus discovering a new continent.</t1724> <t1725>Go up.</t1725> <t1726>I just wish Tom Sawyer were here right now.</t1726>
<t1727>Jim grumbled a bit, but then he complied.</t1727> <t1728>He said we should stop talking, and if we must speak, to do so very quietly.</t1728> <t1729>Lightning flashed just as we caught sight of the wrecked ship and approached it.</t1729> <t1730>We searched for the mast to tie our raft to.</t1730> <t1731>The side of the ship was high here.</t1731> <t1732>In the darkness, we carefully felt our way along the side of the ship to the cabin door; it felt like our feet were moving too slowly.</t1732> <t1733>We reached out in front of us to avoid bumping into posts, as it was pitch black and we couldn't see a thing.</t1733> <t1734>Gradually, our eyes adjusted to the dim light of the night, and we managed to climb up.</t1734> <t1735>One more step and we would reach the captain's cabin door.</t1735> <t1736>The door was already open.</t1736> <t1737>Standing next to Jim, I looked down into the engine room and saw a faint light, and at that moment, it seemed we also heard murmuring voices coming from that direction.</t1737>
<t1738>Jim leaned into my ear and whispered that he was very scared, telling me to leave.</t1738> <t1739>I said okay, and was about to head back to the raft when I heard a shout.</t1739>
<t1740>- Oh, please, I beg you, don't, I swear I won't tell.</t1740>
<t1741>The voice of another person was louder:</t1741>
<t1742>- You are lying, Jim Turner.</t1742> <t1743>You have done this before.</t1743> <t1744>You always demand more than your share, and every time you get it because you threaten to expose us if you don't.</t1744> <t1745>This time you are saying the same thing.</t1745> <t1746>You are the most despicable, deceitful dog in this place.</t1746>
<t1747>At this moment, Jim had already gone to the raft.</t1747> <t1748>As for me, my curiosity kept me there, and I told myself; if it were Tom Sawyer, he wouldn't leave now.</t1748> <t1749>So I thought, I should stay too, to see what was going on here.</t1749> <t1750>I crouched down and crept into the dark, making my way to the captain's cabin.</t1750> <t1751>I peeked in and saw a man lying on the floor, tightly bound hand and foot, with two other men standing over him, one holding a dim lantern and the other holding a pistol.</t1751> <t1752>The man with the pistol pointed it at the head of the man on the ground and said:</t1752>
<t1753>- Better that way.</t1753> <t1754>I want to shoot you dead, you skunk.</t1754>
<t1755>The person lying on the floor craned their neck and said:</t1755>
<t1756>- Oh, I beg you, don't, Bill, I swear I will never say:</t1756>
<t1757>Each time it happened, the person holding the lantern would laugh:</t1757>
<t1758>- Are you really not going to talk?</t1758> <t1759>You have never been more truthful than this, right?</t1759> <t1760>Listen to him begging you!</t1760> <t1761>If we don't find a way to tie him up, he'll kill us all.</t1761> <t1762>And what are you planning to kill us for? You won't gain anything.</t1762> <t1763>We just want to protect our own interests.</t1763> <t1764>But I won't let you scare anyone anymore, you hear me, Jim Turner.</t1764> <t1765>Put the gun down, Bill.</t1765>
<t1766>Bill said:</t1766>
<t1767>- I don't want that, Jake Packark.</t1767> <t1768>I want to kill him.</t1768> <t1769>Didn't he kill old Hatfield like that before? Isn't it worth killing him now?</t1769>
<t1770>- But I don't want it to die, and I already have my plan.</t1770>
<t1771>The person lying on the ground is crying and wailing.</t1771>
<t1772>- Please, spare Jack Packard! As long as I live, I will never forget you.</t1772>
<t1773>Packard didn't pay attention to those words, hung the lamp on a nail, and walked towards the spot where I was hiding in the dark and called Bill to come out as well.</t1773>
<t1774>I hurriedly crawled quickly for a few yards, but the ship was swaying, so I couldn't get far. To avoid being stepped on and caught, I crawled back up towards the cockpit.</t1774> <t1775>The person leading the way groped in the darkness, reaching the cockpit right next to where I was hiding; then said:</t1775>
<t1776>- Here, come in.</t1776>
<t1777>He was let in, and Bill followed.</t1777><t1778>But before the two of them fully entered, I had already managed to slip up onto the hanging bed above and curl up in a corner.</t1778><t1779>Regretting in my gut that I had foolishly crawled to this spot.</t1779><t1780>They stood right next to me, holding onto the bed frame and talking.</t1780><t1781>I couldn't see the two clearly, but I could tell where they were standing because their breath reeked of whiskey.</t1781><t1782>Fortunately, I don't drink whiskey; but that didn't make much difference; they still couldn't know I was lying there because I wasn't breathing. I was too scared.</t1782><t1783>Besides, if I breathed, I wouldn't be able to hear their conversation.</t1783><t1784>They spoke very softly and slowly.</t1784><t1785>Bill wanted to know about Turner right away. He said:</t1785>
<t1786>- It said it would tell, so it will definitely tell.</t1786> <t1787>If we have to give it our share, it still wouldn't be any better, especially after all the hard work and the way we've been serving it.</t1787> <t1788>Everything we've done, it will report it all; do you hear me?</t1788> <t1789>I'll get rid of it, and that'll be the end of it.</t1789>
<t1790>Packard calmly said:</t1790>
<t1791>- I thought the same.</t1791>
<t1792>- You monkey. I thought you didn't want that.</t1792> <t1793>If so, that's great.</t1793> <t1794>Alright, let's get to it.</t1794>
<t1795>- Wait a minute, I haven't finished talking.</t1795> <t1796>Listen here, shooting is fine but there are quieter ways if we need to kill it.</t1796> <t1797>I think this: if we hang it, we'll feel guilty wherever we go later.</t1797> <t1798>If there's a way like that without any worries and also not dangerous for us, we should do it, don't you think?</t1798>
<t1799>- Yes, but what else can be done at this moment?</t1799>
<t1800>- No, I think we should look around here, pick up the things we find in the cockpit, and hide them on the shore first. Then we'll see.</t1800> <t1801>I'm sure that in just over two hours, this ship will break apart and sink to the bottom.</t1801> <t1802>Do you hear?</t1802> <t1803>It will drown, and it won't be able to blame anyone, only itself.</t1803> <t1804>I think killing it this way is the best option.</t1804> <t1805>I don't want to kill someone and then be haunted by it forever.</t1805> <t1806>That's not good, and it's not ethical.</t1806> <t1807>Isn't it?</t1807>
<t1808>- Yeah, I think you might be right.</t1808> <t1809>But what if the ship doesn't break or sink?</t1809>
<t1810>- Well, anyway, let's wait for two hours and see what happens</t1810>
<t1811>- Alright, let's go!</t1811>
<t1812>Two people stepped out, and I slipped out after them, cold sweat covering my body.</t1812> <t1813>I crawled forward.</t1813> <t1814>It was pitch dark. I softly called out: Jim, right next to my arm, Jim's voice responded, sounding like a moan. I said:</t1814>
<t1815>- Hurry up, Jim. There's no time for nonsense and lamenting anymore.</t1815> <t1816>There are some robbers in there.</t1816> <t1817>If we find their boat and let it drift away so they can't escape from this wrecked ship, one of them will be doomed.</t1817> <t1818>And if we find their boat, we can ensure that all of them are caught because the sheriff will come and arrest them.</t1818> <t1819>Now hurry up, I'll go to the side of the pilot's cabin, and you run to the other side.</t1819> <t1820>You go to the raft then...</t1820>
<t1821>Oh, my God, the raft? Where is the raft? It has broken loose and drifted away - well, we're stuck here now!</t1821>
<t1822>Chapter XIII</t1822>
<t1823>I was breathless, almost about to collapse.</t1823> <t1824>Being stuck on a wrecked ship with a bunch of pirates like this! But no, there’s no time to sit and lament.</t1824> <t1825>We had to find a way to get something out of there and escape.</t1825> <t1826>We walked while shaking the ship's sides, but why did it feel so slow, as if it would take a week just to reach the stern.</t1826>
<t1827>There was no sign of any boat.</t1827> <t1828>Jim said he wasn't sure if he could walk anymore, he was so scared that he had no strength left to walk - that's what he said.</t1828> <t1829>But I urged him to keep going, if we got stuck on this wrecked ship, we would surely die.</t1829> <t1830>We continued to grope our way forward.</t1830> <t1831>We managed to reach the stern, clinging to the window frame, but the window was almost submerged.</t1831> <t1832>When we got to the main door to go to the passenger cabin, we saw a small boat there.</t1832>
<t1833>It's definitely a boat, I can see it clearly.</t1833>
<t1834>Oh my God! There is no greater joy than this.</t1834> <t1835>I was just about to climb up when the door suddenly opened.</t1835> <t1836>A person stuck their head out, just about half a meter away from me.</t1836> <t1837>I thought I was done for, but then the person pulled their head back in and said:</t1837>
<t1838>- Lift the lamp up a bit so we can see, Bill!</t1838>
<t1839>He threw some kind of bundle into the ship's hold, then stepped in following the steps down.</t1839> <t1840>That was Packard.</t1840> <t1841>Then Bill followed in as well.</t1841> <t1842>Packard whispered:</t1842>
<t1843>- It's all done, push it</t1843>
<t1844>- I couldn't swing up to the door, because I was too weak.</t1844>
<t1845>Bill said:</t1845>
<t1846>- Hold on to it, have you thoroughly checked it yet?</t1846>
<t1847>- Not yet, did you check again?</t1847>
<t1848>- No, but it hasn't taken its share yet.</t1848>
<t1849>- Alright, that's enough, go, you don't need to take your belongings or leave any money behind.</t1849>
<t1850>- But hey, could it be suspected that I went up to do something?</t1850>
<t1851>- Maybe not.</t1851> <t1852>But anyway, I've already got it in the bag.</t1852> <t1853>Let's go.</t1853>
<t1854>Then they went out.</t1854>
<t1855>The door slammed shut because it was on the side that closed in.</t1855> <t1856>In just a split second, I had jumped into the small boat.</t1856> <t1857>Jim shakily jumped in after me, and I pulled out my pocket knife to cut the rope.</t1857> <t1858>And then we were off.</t1858>
<t1859>We did not touch a single paddle, did not speak nor whisper, not even daring to breathe heavily.</t1859> <t1860>Letting the boat glide silently, as quiet as death, passing by the ship's wheel, then passing by the stern, and a few seconds later, we were nearly a hundred meters away from the wrecked ship.</t1860> <t1861>The darkness had completely obscured everything, and we could no longer see the ship.</t1861> <t1862>And we knew that we had escaped.</t1862>
<t1863>When we had gone about three or four hundred meters away, I looked back and saw the light flicker for a moment at the engine room door for about a second.</t1863> <t1864>We knew that those guys couldn't leave the ship and were just as confused as Jim Turner, who was tied up.</t1864>
<t1865>Then Jim took the oar, and we quickly rowed the boat to find our raft.</t1865>
<t1866>At this point, I began to think about those guys, because honestly, earlier I didn't have the heart to worry about them at all.</t1866> <t1867>I started to think that, even for murderers, being trapped to death in such a situation is truly horrifying.</t1867> <t1868>I told myself that I couldn't talk about becoming a murderer, so how could I possibly want them to be like that.</t1868> <t1869>I told Jim:</t1869>
<t1870>- Whenever we see a place with lights, we will dock about a hundred meters from there, find a spot where you can hide this small boat, and I will go find someone who came to the shipwreck earlier to rescue those pirates.</t1870>
<t1871>But that idea couldn't be carried out, because just as it was mentioned, the storm came again, and this time it was even more terrifying.</t1871> <t1872>The rain poured down without any lightning.</t1872> <t1873>I think at this moment everyone was asleep.</t1873> <t1874>We kept rowing the boat along the river, looking for lights, looking for our raft.</t1874> <t1875>After a very long time, the rain stopped but the sky was still heavy with clouds, then there was a rumbling thunder and a flash of lightning, we saw something black floating ahead, and we rushed forward to chase it.</t1875>
<t1876>That is the raft.</t1876> <t1877>We were extremely delighted and climbed back on.</t1877> <t1878>On the right bank, a little below us, we suddenly saw a light.</t1878> <t1879>I decided to go there.</t1879> <t1880>The boat was still full of the belongings that the robbers had taken and loaded in.</t1880> <t1881>We hauled a pile of them onto the raft.</t1881> <t1882>I told Jim to let the boat drift further downstream.</t1882> <t1883>I pointed out to him the light that he thought was nearly two miles away, but the light kept flickering until we got closer.</t1883> <t1884>I took up the paddle and pushed the boat towards the light.</t1884> <t1885>The closer I got, the more I saw three or four more lights flashing on the hillside.</t1885> <t1886>It turned out to be a village.</t1886> <t1887>I moved towards the light closest to the shore, keeping the paddle in place to let the boat drift gently.</t1887> <t1888>When I got there and looked closely, it turned out to be a lantern hanging on the mast of a wrecked ship.</t1888> <t1889>I stepped up to find the guard and saw a guy sleeping there, his head leaning forward and his knees tucked in as he slept.</t1889> <t1890>I gently tapped him on the shoulder twice and then spoke in a tearful tone.</t1890>
<t1891>He startled awake, looked out and saw only me, then yawned, stretched, and said:</t1891>
<t1892>- Huh, what's going on? Don't cry, little brother.</t1892> <t1893>What's wrong, what's wrong?</t1893>
<t1894>I replied:</t1894>
<t1895>- My father, my mother, and my sister, and...</t1895>
<t1896>Then I stopped.</t1896> <t1897>He asked:</t1897>
<t1898>- Oh, don't worry.</t1898> <t1899>Just relax. Everyone has difficulties, but it all works out in the end.</t1899> <t1900>So, what's wrong with them?</t1900>
<t1901>- They... uh - they... but are you the train guard?</t1901>
<t1902>- Yes - He answered with a delighted voice.</t1902> <t1903>I am the captain, the owner of the ship, the assistant, the helmsman, the watchman, the commander on deck, sometimes I am the cargo, and the passenger on the ship too.</t1903> <t1904>I am not as wealthy as old Jim Hornback, and I cannot get along well with Tom, Dick, and Harry like old Jim does, but I have vouched many times that I would not trade places with him, because listen here, my life is the life of a sailor, and if I live two miles away from the city, I would be very bored, because there is nothing interesting in this place; I am not here for his money, I say I don't need it...</t1904>
<t1905>I interjected:</t1905>
<t1906>- They are about to die and...</t1906>
<t1907>- Oh?</t1907>
<t1908>- And who else, father, mother, sister, and Miss Hooker, if you can take this boat to that place...</t1908>
<t1909>- Where, where are they?</t1909>
<t1910>- on the sinking ship</t1910>
<t1911>- Which ship sank?</t1911>
<t1912>- Which train? There's only one.</t1912>
<t1913>- Huh! Are you talking about the Walter Scott ship?</t1913>
<t1914>- Yes</t1914>
<t1915>- Oh my God, what on earth are they doing here?</t1915>
<t1916>- It's not that they want to go there</t1916>
<t1917>- I know!</t1917> <t1918>It's really bad, if they don't get out quickly, it will be very dangerous.</t1918> <t1919>But how could they be so unlucky?</t1919>
<t1920>- It's nothing, probably just Hooker planning to head up to the province</t1920>
<t1921>- Yes, and then what?</t1921>
<t1922>- She intended to take that route to Booth Landing, and somehow by nightfall, she ended up going with a black servant who planned to take a horse ferry to a friend's house and stay there overnight. I can't quite remember the name of that friend, but then somehow they lost the oar while rowing, and the boat turned sideways and drifted downriver, the stern leading the way for nearly two miles, and then crashed right into a wrecked ship. Both the boatman and the black servant went missing.</t1922> <t1923>As for Miss Hooker, she managed to cling to the wrecked ship.</t1923> <t1924>About an hour after dusk, we rowed along searching, but it was too dark to see the wrecked ship, so we ended up crashing into it as well, and our boat capsized.</t1924> <t1925>All of us made it out, except for Bill Whipple.</t1925> <t1926>Oh my God, Bill was such a smart person.</t1926> <t1927>I keep thinking, why didn't I die instead of Bill!</t1927>
<t1928>- Uncle George, I've truly never heard of such a painful thing before! So what happened to you all after that?</t1928>
<t1929>- We shouted loudly, but the river was too wide, no one could hear us.</t1929> <t1930>Then my father said someone should go ashore and call for help. Only I knew how to swim, so I went immediately. Ms. Hooker told me that if I couldn't quickly find someone to help, I should come back right away and call her uncle so he could figure out a solution.</t1930> <t1931>I went nearly a mile searching, hoping to find someone to help, but everyone said: Oh my, it's night, with the river like this, how can we rescue anyone? We need to find a ferry boat.</t1931> <t1932>So, now please go and...</t1932>
<t1933>- Well, I want to, but damn it, I don't know if I should.</t1933> <t1934>And who is going to pay me?</t1934> <t1935>Is it your father?</t1935>
<t1936>- What? Of course. Miss Hooker told me that, especially since her uncle is Mr. Hornback...</t1936>
<t1937>- Goodness, is he her uncle?</t1937> <t1938>Here, let me tell you, go around that place with the light over there, then turn west, walk about a quarter of a mile and you'll reach an inn, ask them to show you the way and Jim Hornback will sign the paper to pay for it.</t1938> <t1939>And don't dawdle, because he's waiting for news.</t1939> <t1940>Tell him that I'll ensure his niece's safety before he goes to the city.</t1940> <t1941>Now, run as fast as you can.</t1941> <t1942>I'll stay around here to find the mechanic.</t1942>
<t1943>I went around to the place with the light, but waited until he had just gone to the corner, then I turned back and jumped into my small boat to escape straight away.</t1943> <t1944>I let the boat go along the shore where the water was still for about six hundred meters, then I hid among the wooden boats docked there to watch, because I wasn't at ease until I saw the patrol boat leave the dock.</t1944> <t1945>But all in all, I felt relieved because I had struggled with those robbers while many others wouldn't have done the same.</t1945> <t1946>I hope the widow knows about this.</t1946> <t1947>I'm sure she will be proud of me for helping those unruly men because those unruly, useless people are the ones the widow and respectable people often care about.</t1947>
<t1948>Then after a long while, I saw the wrecked ship approaching, dark and looming, slowly drifting down.</t1948> <t1949>When I saw it, a cold feeling made me startle.</t1949> <t1950>It looked truly massive, and for a moment I thought that if anyone were inside, it would be very difficult to survive.</t1950> <t1951>I pushed the boat closer and called out softly, but there was no response, everything was deathly silent.</t1951> <t1952>I felt a bit sad about the pirates, but not too much, because I thought if the world could be indifferent, then so could I.</t1952>
<t1953>Then I saw the ferryboat coming.</t1953> <t1954>I immediately rowed out to the middle of the river to a spot with an undercurrent, and once I was sure I was out of sight, I rested my oars, turned around, and watched the ferryboat follow, releasing a cloud of smoke that completely obscured the damaged boat ahead, which had Miss Hooker's body that the captain earlier was convinced was inside and thought he could bring back to old Hornback.</t1954> <t1955>A little while later, the ferryboat let the other boat go on its way, while it turned into the dock.</t1955> <t1956>Then I returned to my work and pushed the boat downstream.</t1956>
<t1957>It took a long time before I saw Jim's light, and when it flashed, it looked like it was thousands of miles away.</t1957>
<t1958>At this moment, the horizon had already lightened with a grayish-blue color, so we went back to the island, hid the raft, sank the small boat, and then went back to sleep like the dead.</t1958>
<t1959>Chapter XIV</t1959>
<t1960>When we woke up, we opened the bundle of things the robbers had taken from the wrecked ship to see what was inside. There were shoes, blankets, clothes, and all sorts of other things, a set of books, a pair of binoculars, and three boxes of cigars.</t1960> <t1961>We had never been so rich in our lives.</t1961> <t1962>The cigars were of the finest quality.</t1962> <t1963>We spent the whole afternoon lying in the forest talking.</t1963> <t1964>I read books, which was very enjoyable.</t1964> <t1965>I recounted to Jim everything that had happened on the wrecked ship and at the ferry, and then I told him that those were adventures.</t1965> <t1966>But Jim said he didn't like such adventures anymore.</t1966> <t1967>He said that when I was curious and went into the ship's cabin, he crawled back to the raft only to find it had drifted away. He was almost paralyzed with fear and thought it was the end of his life, that he wouldn't escape from there, and if no one came to rescue him, he would drown.</t1967> <t1968>And if someone did rescue him, they would take him back for a reward, and Miss Watson would sell him down South. That was certain.</t1968> <t1969>He was right.</t1969> <t1970>He usually made sense when he spoke. He had an unusually sharp mind for a black man.</t1970>
<t1971>I read to Jim quite a lot about kings, dukes, counts, etc... how they dressed in luxurious and splendid attire with all sorts of styles, addressing each other with terms like: "Your Majesty," "Your Grace," "Your Highness," etc... instead of calling each other "sir."</t1971> <t1972>Jim sat listening, his eyes wide open, very attentive. He said:</t1972>
<t1973>- I don't know why they have so many of them.</t1973> <t1974>In the past, I only heard of one king, and even then, it was rarely mentioned, that is, King Solomon, but I had no idea you had to count those kings like counting cows and horses.</t1974> <t1975>So how much money does each king get?</t1975><t1976>?</t1976>
<t1977>- Can they?</t1977> <t1978>Those guys can get a thousand dollars a month if they want; whatever they want, they get.</t1978> <t1979>Everything belongs to them.</t1979>
<t1980>- Oh, that's interesting, isn't it? So what are those gentlemen doing, Huck?</t1980>
<t1981>- They don't do anything at all.</t1981> <t1982>Why are you so foolish? They just sit there.</t1982>
<t1983>-Nonsense! Really?</t1983>
<t1984>- Of course, that's how it is.</t1984> <t1985>They just sit there.</t1985> <t1986>Maybe except in cases like going to war, then they go to the battlefield.</t1986> <t1987>But at other times, they just lounge around, or go hunting, and... shh...</t1987> <t1988>Jim, did you hear something?</t1988>
<t1989>We quietly stepped out to look, but there was nothing, only the clattering sound of a train heading downstream, passing by.</t1989> <t1990>The two of us then returned to our spot.</t1990>
<t1991>I continued speaking:</t1991>
<t1992>- Yes, at other times, like when they are sad, they look at the parliament, if anyone doesn't comply, they hit them on the head, but mostly those kings just linger around in the harem.</t1992>
<t1993>- In what?</t1993>
<t1994>- Female palace</t1994>
<t1995>- What is the female palace?</t1995>
<t1996>- It's the place where those men keep their wives.</t1996> <t1997>Don't you understand what a harem is?</t1997> <t1998>King Solomon also had a harem like that in the past, and he had up to a million wives.</t1998>
<t1999>- Ah, that's right, that's right.</t1999> <t2000>I forgot about it.</t2000> <t2001>The harem is like a house full of people, I'm sure of it.</t2001> <t2002>It's probably like the chaos in an orphanage, isn't it?</t2002> <t2003>I'm sure when those wives fight with each other, it must be something to see!</t2003> <t2004>It's bound to be chaotic.</t2004> <t2005>And then they say that King Solomon was the wisest man on earth.</t2005> <t2006>I don't believe that.</t2006> <t2007>Why? If he was wise, why would he live in such a messy situation like that?</t2007> <t2008>No, he definitely wasn't wise.</t2008> <t2009>A wise person would set up a food factory, and when he wanted to rest, he would just close the factory.</t2009>
<t2010>- But anyway, he used to be the wisest person, because even the widow told me so.</t2010>
<t2011>- I don't know what that widow said, but King Solomon was definitely not a wise man.</t2011> <t2012>He had ways of judging people that I had never seen before.</t2012> <t2013>Do you know the story of the baby that he intended to cut in half?</t2013>
<t2014>- Yes, the widow also told me about this matter</t2014>
<t2015>- There! See! Isn't that the most bitter thing in life? Just think about it.</t2015> <t2016>That matter is so complicated, on one side is a woman, you hear me, for example, you are another woman; I am Solomon, and this dollar bill is the child.</t2016> <t2017>Both sides demand to take it.</t2017> <t2018>So what should I do?</t2018> <t2019>Should I go ask the neighbors whose dollar bill it is, and then give it to the one who has the whole bill intact; all practical-minded people would do that, right? But instead, I go and tear the dollar bill in half and give one half to you, and the other half to the other woman. That's what Mr. Solomon did with a child.</t2019> <t2020>Now let me ask you: what can you do with half a dollar bill?</t2020> <t2021>You can't buy anything.</t2021> <t2022>So what can you do with half a child?</t2022> <t2023>I think that even if a million kings did that, it still wouldn't be worth a penny.</t2023>
<t2024>- Stop it, Jim, you're completely wrong, nonsense, you're off by thousands of miles.</t2024>
<t2025>- Oh, me? Please. Don't talk about your measurements with me.</t2025> <t2026>I know that when I see something clearly, I understand its meaning right away.</t2026> <t2027>And the meaning of this cannot be confused with that.</t2027> <t2028>Arguing like this is not about winning half of the child, but the whole child, and anyone who thinks they can resolve the argument by giving each side half of the child is like someone walking in the rain without knowing how to avoid getting wet.</t2028> <t2029>So, don't talk to me about Solomon anymore, Huck, I know even the back of his head.</t2029>
<t2030>- But I told you that you're speaking out of turn!</t2030>
<t2031>- Ignore that measurement of yours.</t2031> <t2032>What I know is what I know.</t2032> <t2033>You have to understand that the container for measuring the truth can go even deeper.</t2033> <t2034>Whether it's right or wrong lies in the judgment of Mr. Sollermun, doesn't it?</t2034> <t2035>Try taking the example of a person with one or two children, would that person dare to sacrifice their children?</t2035> <t2036>No, there's no such thing.</t2036> <t2037>That person would know the value of children.</t2037> <t2038>But if you take someone who has about five million children at home, then it's different.</t2038> <t2039>He would be ready to cut a child in half like cutting a cat.</t2039> <t2040>Because he has many.</t2040> <t2041>One or two children, more or less, what does that mean to Sollermun?</t2041>
<t2042>- I have never seen a black man like that.</t2042> <t2043>If he has an idea in his head, it's impossible to make him give it up.</t2043> <t2044>He is the black man who has blasphemed Sollermun the most, and now I know he is one.</t2044> <t2045>So I had to talk about other kings, putting the story of Sollermun aside.</t2045> <t2046>I talked about King Louis XVI of France, who had been beheaded a long time ago, and mentioned his young son, the crown prince, who was supposed to become king but was imprisoned, and some say he died there.</t2046>
<t2047>- Poor, unfortunate boy!</t2047>
<t2048>- But there are also people who say that he escaped death and has gone to America.</t2048>
<t2049>- That's great!</t2049> <t2050>But surely he doesn't have a place to make a living, right?</t2050> <t2051>What does he plan to do?</t2051>
<t2052>- Who knows.</t2052> <t2053>Among those kings, some became police officers, and some became French teachers.</t2053>
<t2054>- Oh, so the French don't speak like us, Huck?</t2054>
<t2055>- No, Jim, if you listen to what people say, you won't understand a single sentence, not even a word.</t2055>
<t2056>- Oh, then I am really foolish.</t2056> <t2057>So what should I do?</t2057>
<t2058>- I don't know either.</t2058> <t2059>But that's how it is.</t2059> <t2060>I saw a few of their words in the book.</t2060> <t2061>For example, if someone comes and asks you: "Parlez-vous français?" what would you think?</t2061>
<t2062>- I don't think anything of it.</t2062> <t2063>I would hit him on the head, that is, if he were not a white man.</t2063> <t2064>If he were black, I wouldn't allow anyone to call me that.</t2064>
<t2065>- Go away, that's not calling you.</t2065> <t2066>That's just asking if you know how to speak French.</t2066>
<t2067>- Well, why couldn't he just say it straight out like that?</t2067>
<t2068>- He himself said it like that.</t2068> <t2069>That is the way the French speak.</t2069>
<t2070>- Oh, that is really bizarre, strange.</t2070> <t2071>But anyway, I don't want to hear about it anymore.</t2071> <t2072>It doesn't make any sense at all.</t2072>
<t2073>- Here, Jim, I ask if the cat speaks like us?</t2073>
<t2074>- No, which cat said that</t2074>
<t2075>- Ah, what about the cow?</t2075>
<t2076>- Not even crawling</t2076>
<t2077>- Does the cat speak like the cow?</t2077> <t2078>Or does the cow speak like the cat?</t2078>
<t2079>- No</t2079>
<t2080>- So it's natural and correct for one child to speak differently from another, right?</t2080>
<t2081>- Of course</t2081>
<t2082>- And the cat, the cow speaking differently from us, is that also natural and correct?</t2082>
<t2083>- Oh, it definitely is like that</t2083>
<t2084>- Ah, so why do the French speak differently from us, saying it's incorrect and unnatural.</t2084> <t2085>Try answering me.</t2085>
<t2086>- Is the cat someone else, Huck?</t2086>
<t2087>- No</t2087>
<t2088>- Ah, then the cat can't talk like a human.</t2088> <t2089>So is the cow a human - is the cow a cat?</t2089>
<t2090>- No, none of them are cats.</t2090>
<t2091>- Ah, that's really strange, why can't he speak like a human?</t2091> <t2092>Can you try to answer me?</t2092>
<t2093>I find that sitting and talking like this is just a waste of words.</t2093> <t2094>I can't possibly learn the way black people reason.</t2094> <t2095>So I stopped.</t2095>
<t2096>Chapter XV</t2096>
<t2097>We calculated that in just three more nights we would reach Cairo, which is at the southern tip of Illinois, where the Ohio River flows in, and that is exactly where we intended to go.</t2097> <t2098>We would sell the raft and board a steamboat to travel up the Ohio River through the free states, so there would be nothing to worry about anymore.</t2098>
<t2099>On the second night, the fog suddenly became so thick that we had to find a ravine to tie the raft.</t2099> <t2100>Because it was not wise to recklessly continue in the fog.</t2100> <t2101>But while I was rowing the boat upstream, carrying a hook pole, I couldn't find a place to hook it as there were only small reeds.</t2101> <t2102>I cast the fishing line to wrap it around a reed on the water's edge, but this spot had such a strong current that it uprooted the reed and it kept drifting away.</t2102> <t2103>The fog grew heavier, making me so scared that I couldn't move for half a minute.</t2103> <t2104>Without the raft here, I couldn't see more than twenty meters ahead.</t2104> <t2105>I jumped to the back of the boat, grabbed the paddle, and pushed back once.</t2105> <t2106>But the boat didn't budge. It turned out I was in such a hurry that I hadn't untied the rope.</t2106> <t2107>I stood up to untie the rope, but I was so nervous that my hands were shaking and I couldn't do anything.</t2107>
<t2108>As soon as I untied the rope, I immediately rowed to find the raft, the cozy raft carrying our heavy belongings right at the head of that creek.</t2108> <t2109>I found it right away because it was only sixty yards away.</t2109> <t2110>Just as I got close, I ran into an even thicker fog, unable to find my way out; it was as if I were completely dead.</t2110>
<t2111>I think perhaps we shouldn't row the boat anymore; first, let's get closer to the shore or land somewhere.</t2111> <t2112>I had to sit still and let the boat drift, and having to sit still with my hands tied at that moment was very distressing.</t2112> <t2113>I cleared my throat and listened.</t2113> <t2114>Far below, I heard a faint sound echoing back, which reassured me.</t2114> <t2115>I moved closer to hear more clearly.</t2115> <t2116>Getting even closer, it was on the left side.</t2116> <t2117>Then I heard nothing more, and I didn't search further because I had to keep turning the boat in all directions; instead, I just kept heading straight ahead.</t2117>
<t2118>At that moment, I wished that someone would just bang on a pot and bang it rhythmically so it would be easier to know where to look.</t2118> <t2119>But no one was banging, and the silence, punctuated by a few coughs, only made me more confused.</t2119> <t2120>I went further up, and suddenly I heard a howl behind me.</t2120> <t2121>Well, I was really surrounded.</t2121> <t2122>It was definitely the howl of someone else.</t2122> <t2123>I was definitely surrounded.</t2123>
<t2124>I threw the paddle down.</t2124> <t2125>Again, I heard the howling sound still behind me, but from a different place.</t2125> <t2126>It crept closer, it changed places, it answered itself, occasionally falling silent and then resounding in front of me; I knew that the current had already turned my boat downstream, and if it was Jim and not some other ferryman howling, I would be at ease.</t2126> <t2127>In the fog, nothing seen by the eyes or heard by the ears seems natural anymore.</t2127>
<t2128>The howling continued, and about a minute later, I crashed right into a clearing with several large trees looming like ghosts, then the current pushed me to the left and I crashed into the bank again, amidst a pile of floating rotten wood that creaked when it hit the boat.</t2128> <t2129>And the water continued to quietly meander through the pile of wood.</t2129>
<t2130>Later, the fog became even denser.</t2130> <t2131>Even quieter.</t2131> <t2132>I sat completely still, listening to the pounding of my heart.</t2132> <t2133>I thought if my heart beat reached a hundred, I wouldn't be able to breathe anymore.</t2133>
<t2134>I had to give up.</t2134> <t2135>And I know why it turned out this way.</t2135> <t2136>This stormy mass is an island, and Jim has drifted to the other side.</t2136> <t2137>There is no creek that can be crossed in about ten minutes.</t2137> <t2138>This island also has large trees like any other island; it is probably about five or six miles long and half a mile wide.</t2138>
<t2139>I remained still, listening intently for fifteen minutes.</t2139> <t2140>Of course, the boat continued to drift, at about five or six miles per hour.</t2140> <t2141>But deep inside, I didn't dare to hope for such a thing.</t2141> <t2142>It felt as if I were lying unconscious on the water.</t2142> <t2143>If no piece of wood floated by, it would be impossible to tell how fast or slow I was drifting.</t2143> <t2144>But I just held my breath, thinking and watching the piece of wood float by.</t2144> <t2145>If anyone has never experienced the loneliness and desolation of being alone in the fog late at night, they should try it once to understand.</t2145>
<t2146>Then about half an hour later, I occasionally let out a scream.</t2146> <t2147>After that, I heard a distant reply, tried to follow it but couldn't, and I guessed that I had wandered into a place full of many intertwined streams.</t2147> <t2148>I looked at both banks and saw only darkness.</t2148> <t2149>Sometimes I clearly saw each small canal, sometimes I could only guess because I heard the sound of water hitting the banks.</t2149> <t2150>I didn't even bother to call out in this maze of uneven land anymore, but just walked a bit further, because it was worse than chasing will-o'-the-wisps.</t2150> <t2151>Never before had I heard echoes that lingered and shifted places so quickly.</t2151>
<t2152>Four or five times, I had to take it down to avoid getting stuck on the shore and to prevent it from hitting the rocks in the river.</t2152> <t2153>I was sure the raft had also hit the shore many times; otherwise, it would have moved on and we could have heard it somewhere.</t2153> <t2154>The raft still drifted faster than the boat.</t2154>
<t2155>Then, it seems like I might have crashed into the river again, but I still haven't heard any howling sounds.</t2155> <t2156>I guess Jim must have crashed into some pile of wood, and maybe that's the end of it.</t2156> <t2157>I was so tired, I lay down in the boat and told myself not to care about it anymore.</t2157> <t2158>I thought maybe I should take a little nap.</t2158>
<t2159>But it turned out it wasn't just a blink of an eye, because when I woke up, there were twinkling stars in the sky, the fog had cleared; I had taken a long nap at the stern.</t2159> <t2160>At first, I didn't know where I was.</t2160> <t2161>I thought I was still dreaming, but upon reflection, it gradually felt like the events that had just happened were from a week ago.</t2161>
<t2162>This part of the river is terrifyingly wide, with tall star-like trees lining both banks.</t2162> <t2163>I looked down at the river and saw something dark on the surface of the water.</t2163> <t2164>I approached it and found out it was just two rotten logs tied together.</t2164> <t2165>Then I saw another object, chased it, and it wasn't what I thought either.</t2165> <t2166>Then another time, and this time it was indeed our raft.</t2166>
<t2167>When we arrived, we saw Jim sitting slumped, his head tucked between his knees, sleeping, with his right hand resting on the steering oar.</t2167> <t2168>The oar was broken, and the surface was covered with leaves, branches, and debris.</t2168> <t2169>The raft had gone through a tough ordeal.</t2169>
<t2170>I tied the boat to the raft, then lay down right next to Jim, started yawning, stretched out my legs to kick Jim, and said:</t2170>
<t2171>- Hey Jim, was I sleeping?</t2171> <t2172>Why didn't you wake me up!</t2172>
<t2173>- Oh my God, is that you, Huck? Haven't you died yet, haven't drowned yet, and you're back here?</t2173> <t2174>I'm so glad, Huck, so glad.</t2174> <t2175>Really unexpected.</t2175> <t2176>Let me look at you, let me touch you.</t2176> <t2177>Yes, you're not dead, you're still alive and back here, it's really you, Huck, it's Huck.</t2177> <t2178>Oh my God, so glad!</t2178>
<t2179>- What's wrong with you, Jim? Have you been drinking?</t2179><t2180>?</t2180>
<t2181>- Drinking alcohol? Me, drinking alcohol?</t2181> <t2182>Have I ever drunk alcohol?</t2182>
<t2183>- Uh, so why are you saying such strange things?</t2183>
<t2184>- How am I strange?</t2184>
<t2185>- What else could it be.</t2185> <t2186>Why do you keep talking about things that make me feel like I'm coming back with all those weird things.</t2186> <t2187>It's as if I'm dead!</t2187>
<t2188>- Huck, Huck Finn, look straight into my eyes.</t2188> <t2189>Look straight into my eyes.</t2189> <t2190>Did you go away?</t2190>
<t2191>- Gone?</t2191> <t2192>Strange, I don't understand what you mean by that?</t2192> <t2193>I haven't gone anywhere.</t2193> <t2194>And where would I go anyway?</t2194>
<t2195>- No, listen to me.</t2195> <t2196>There must be something wrong.</t2196> <t2197>Am I really myself?</t2197> <t2198>Or who am I? Am I here or somewhere else? I want to know that.</t2198>
<t2199>- Oh, I thought you were here, completely intact, but I suppose you might be out of your mind or something, Jim</t2199>
<t2200>- I'm here, right?</t2200> <t2201>Alright, then answer this for me: did you jump into the boat earlier to tie the raft to the mouth of the creek?</t2201>
<t2202>- No, not at all.</t2202> <t2203>Which raft head? I don't see any gap at all.</t2203>
<t2204>- Can't you see any gap?</t2204> <t2205>Here, is it like the raft's rope broke and drifted down the river, leaving you alone with the boat in the fog?</t2205>
<t2206>- Which fog?</t2206>
<t2207>- There's no more fog.</t2207> <t2208>The fog covered the whole night, didn't it?</t2208> <t2209>Didn't you call out and I answered?</t2209> <t2210>Then we got lost all over this island and no one knew where anyone was, right?</t2210> <t2211>Then I got stuck in a dense storm, struggling and almost drowned!</t2211> <t2212>Isn't that right?</t2212> <t2213>Or is it not?</t2213> <t2214>Answer me</t2214>
<t2215>- Oh, then I give up, Jim.</t2215> <t2216>I don't see anything at all.</t2216> <t2217>Fog, then the island, then all sorts of things, I don't see anything at all.</t2217> <t2218>I've been sitting here talking to you all night until you went to bed ten minutes ago, and I think I also fell asleep.</t2218> <t2219>You probably drank alcohol, so you slept so deeply.</t2219>
<t2220>- Nonsense, how could I have dreamed all those things in just ten minutes?</t2220>
<t2221>- Stop talking.</t2221> <t2222>It's true that you were dreaming, because nothing happened at all.</t2222>
<t2223>- But clearly I saw all of that, Huck</t2223>
<t2224>- Clear or not clear, I don't know, but there is nothing at all.</t2224> <t2225>I know it is true, because I have been here the whole time since then.</t2225>
<t2226>Jim was silent for five minutes, saying nothing, just sitting there thinking. Then he said:</t2226>
<t2227>- Alright, let's just assume I was sleepwalking, Huck, but I swear I've never sleepwalked as intensely as this.</t2227> <t2228>And never have I felt as tired after sleepwalking as I do this time.</t2228>
<t2229>- Oh, it's nothing, a dream always makes one tired.</t2229> <t2230>But this dream is said to be interesting; tell me about it, Jim.</t2230>
<t2231>So Jim began to recount everything from that moment, exactly as it had happened, and Jim also embellished it quite a bit.</t2231> <t2232>Then Jim said we had to figure it out this way, because it was divine retribution.</t2232> <t2233>He said that the first stream head was someone trying to help us, but the current was a second person wanting to cut us off from the first.</t2233> <t2234>The occasional howls we heard were warnings to us, and if we didn't try to understand them, we could avoid them.</t2234> <t2235>A bunch of other streams represented the difficulties showing that we were about to clash with troublemakers and all other bad people.</t2235> <t2236>But if we paid careful attention to our work, didn't tell anyone about it, and didn't complicate things, we could avoid disaster, escape the fog, reach the clear river, and that would be freedom; from there, we wouldn't encounter any more calamities.</t2236> <t2237>By the time I returned to the raft, dark clouds were gathering quite a bit, but now the sky was clearing up.</t2237>
<t2238>I said:</t2238>
<t2239>- Very good, you guessed it right, Jim.</t2239> <t2240>But where should we put these things? I said while pointing at the piles of leaves, debris, and the broken paddle on the raft.</t2240> <t2241>Now those things are even more visible.</t2241> <t2242>Jim looked at the debris, then looked at me, and then looked back at the debris.</t2242> <t2243>He was so strongly haunted by the dream that he seemed unable to shake it off and properly look at the things around him.</t2243> <t2244>But after he had carefully examined those things, he stared at me, not smiling, and said:</t2244>
<t2245>- What for?</t2245> <t2246>Then I'll tell you this.</t2246> <t2247>After I was so tired from messing around there and calling you forever without seeing you, I went to sleep, and in my heart, I was extremely pained because I had lost you.</t2247> <t2248>I didn't even care what would happen to me and the raft anymore.</t2248> <t2249>When I woke up and saw you had returned intact, I shed tears, I could have knelt down and kissed your feet because I was so overwhelmingly happy.</t2249> <t2250>Yet you could make up lies to tell this Jim.</t2250> <t2251>Those people are wood, are trash, and those are the filthy things that people put into your mind to make you feel ashamed.</t2251>
<t2252>Then Jim quietly stood up and walked into the tent, not saying another word.</t2252> <t2253>That's more than enough.</t2253> <t2254>I felt so guilty that I almost wanted to kneel down and kiss Jim's feet to make him come back.</t2254>
<t2255>It took me fifteen minutes to get up, to apologize in front of a black man.</t2255> <t2256>But after doing that, I never had to feel remorse or regret again.</t2256> <t2257>Later on, I didn't dare to play such inappropriate jokes on Jim, and regarding this matter, if I had known that Jim felt that way, I wouldn't have dared to joke.</t2257>
<t2258>Chapter XVI</t2258>
<t2259>We slept for most of the day, and at night we followed a large raft that was as long as a procession.</t2259> <t2260>At the four corners of the raft were four large and long oars, and we guessed the raft must carry about thirty to forty people.</t2260> <t2261>On the raft, there were five large tents with an open-air kitchen in the middle, and at each end of the raft, there was a very tall flagpole.</t2261> <t2262>This raft looked truly majestic.</t2262> <t2263>On such large rafts, the raft operators must be very valuable.</t2263>
<t2264>We rowed on and followed the river to a vast, expansive area.</t2264> <t2265>At night, the clouds rose high, and the sky began to heat up intensely.</t2265> <t2266>The river was very wide, and both banks were densely packed with large trees; it seemed as if there was no place for sunlight to penetrate through.</t2266> <t2267>We talked to each other about Cairo, wondering when we would finally reach and see Cairo.</t2267> <t2268>I said it seemed like we wouldn't get there, because I heard that there were only about a dozen houses there, and if they didn't light up at night, how would we know we had passed by?</t2268> <t2269>Jim said that the place where two large rivers meet is the right spot.</t2269> <t2270>But I said maybe we were circling around the head of an island and then returning to the old river or something.</t2270> <t2271>That made Jim worried - and me too, for the whole evening.</t2271> <t2272>So the question was: What do we do now? I said that whenever we saw lights, we should immediately turn to the shore, tell people that my father was following with a merchant ship, and since he was new to the job, he wasn't sure how far Cairo was.</t2272> <t2273>Jim thought that was a good idea.</t2273> <t2274>So we sat and smoked, waiting.</t2274>
<t2275>At this moment, there was nothing to do but to carefully watch out for the town to avoid passing by without noticing it.</t2275> <t2276>Jim said that we would definitely see it, because if we did, we would have to live in a land of slavery again and would not be able to find freedom anymore.</t2276> <t2277>Suddenly, a moment later, he jumped up and said:</t2277>
<t2278>- Look over there!</t2278>
<t2279>But it wasn't.</t2279> <t2280>It was just a will-o'-the-wisp or a firefly.</t2280> <t2281>Then he sat down again, intently watching as before.</t2281> <t2282>Jim said that when he got close to the land of freedom, he felt himself trembling like he had a fever.</t2282> <t2283>As for me, I can say that it made me tremble feverishly just hearing Jim say that.</t2283> <t2284>Because I also began to feel that in his mind, he was the freest man.</t2284> <t2285>And who was responsible for that? It was me, of course.</t2285> <t2286>In my consciousness, I couldn't understand how or why that was?</t2286> <t2287>It made me so restless that I couldn't sit still, couldn't stand still in one place.</t2287> <t2288>Before, I was never familiar with that idea, but now I was thinking about it.</t2288> <t2289>Now, it haunted me, gripped my hands, and made me increasingly restless.</t2289> <t2290>I tried to tell myself that it wasn't my fault, because it wasn't me who made Jim run away from his rightful owner.</t2290> <t2291>But there was nothing I could do, always conscious of waking up and saying: you must know that Jim ran away for freedom, and you can't go ashore and tell anyone about it.</t2291> <t2292>That's it, I couldn't avoid that thought.</t2292> <t2293>And that's exactly where it appeared.</t2293> <t2294>Consciousness told me again: What did Miss Watson ever do to you that you could calmly watch her black man run away and not say a word?</t2294> <t2295>How did that poor woman treat you that you would treat her so badly?</t2295> <t2296>She taught you, fed you, and treated you well in every way.</t2296> <t2297>Isn't that so?</t2297> <t2298>I suddenly felt so cowardly, so vile, and just wanted to die.</t2298> <t2299>I paced restlessly on the raft, scolding myself; and Jim was also nervously pacing like me.</t2299> <t2300>Neither of us could stay silent.</t2300> <t2301>Every now and then, he would turn abruptly and say: There's Cairo!</t2301> <t2302>The words shot through me like a bullet.</t2302> <t2303>And I also thought that if it was Cairo, I might die a miserable death.</t2303>
<t2304>While I was questioning myself, Jim kept talking loudly.</t2304> <t2305>He said that after reaching a free land, the first thing he would do is open a savings account and never spend a penny.</t2305> <t2306>When he had enough money, he would buy his wife, who is currently working at a farm near where Ms. Watson lives.</t2306> <t2307>Then the couple would work to buy back their two children, and if the owner refused to sell them, they would hire someone to steal them back.</t2307>
<t2308>I heard that and felt a chill run down my spine.</t2308> <t2309>Never before had he dared to speak of such things.</t2309> <t2310>Just try to imagine the moment when he felt he was about to be free, how different it was from before.</t2310> <t2311>It was exactly like the proverb people often say: Give a black man an inch and he will take a mile.</t2311> <t2312>I thought, this is because I didn't think it through beforehand.</t2312> <t2313>This is a black man whom I helped escape, and now he is determined to say that he will go and take back his child, whose child I don't even know; a black man who has never done anything to harm me at all.</t2313>
<t2314>I am very sorry to hear Jim speak like that.</t2314> <t2315>It was truly cowardly. My consciousness returned to its size, and I became more agitated.</t2315> <t2316>Until I responded to my consciousness: Okay, leave it to me, it's never too late.</t2316> <t2317>Seeing the lights, I will immediately row the boat to shore and speak out.</t2317>
<t2318>After answering, I felt comfortable, happy, as light as a floating feather.</t2318> <t2319>All the restlessness disappeared.</t2319> <t2320>I turned to attentively look at the light, feeling secretly joyful inside.</t2320> <t2321>A moment later, a light flashed.</t2321> <t2322>Jim shouted;</t2322>
<t2323>- Don't worry, Huck, jump on, jump on.</t2323> <t2324>This is really our Cairo, I knew it.</t2324>
<t2325>I said:</t2325>
<t2326>- Let me take it down and have a look, Jim.</t2326> <t2327>But it's not certain, you know, Jim?</t2327>
<t2328>He ran out to prepare the boat, took off his old shirt to lay it down for me to sit on, and then handed me the paddle.</t2328> <t2329>As I was leaving, he called after me:</t2329>
<t2330>- Soon I will be able to shout with joy, and I will say: It's all thanks to you, Huck.</t2330> <t2331>I am a free man, and if it weren't for Huck, I could never be free; it was Huck who created that freedom for me.</t2331> <t2332>Jim, I will never forget you, Huck, you are the best friend I have ever had, and now, you are Jim's only friend.</t2332>
<t2333>I rowed the boat away, anxious to reveal this matter, but when I heard him say those words, it felt as if my insides were turned inside out.</t2333> <t2334>I rowed slowly, and I couldn't tell whether I was willing or unwilling to go.</t2334> <t2335>About fifty meters away, Jim spoke again:</t2335>
<t2336>- You truly are Huck, you are the only white person who has kept their promise to Jim.</t2336>
<t2337>I feel heartbroken.</t2337> <t2338>But I tell myself: I have to do it, I can't stand still.</t2338> <t2339>At that moment, a boat carrying two people approached, holding guns.</t2339> <t2340>They stopped, I also stopped.</t2340> <t2341>One person asked:</t2341>
<t2342>- What is over there?</t2342>
<t2343>I answered</t2343>
<t2344>- That's right</t2344>
<t2345>- Is that raft yours?</t2345>
<t2346>- That's right</t2346>
<t2347>- Is there anyone up there?</t2347>
<t2348>- Yes, there is only one person</t2348>
<t2349>- There were five black men who just ran away up there, at the head of the river.</t2349> <t2350>Is your person white or black?</t2350>
<t2351>I couldn't answer right away.</t2351> <t2352>I intended to answer but couldn't speak out.</t2352> <t2353>For a moment or two, I was flustered and couldn't make up my mind, didn't go outside anymore, didn't have the courage of a rabbit.</t2353> <t2354>I felt that I had become too weak.</t2354> <t2355>I had no choice but to stop thinking like I did earlier and said:</t2355>
<t2356>- White skin</t2356>
<t2357>- Let them go see for themselves</t2357>
<t2358>I said:</t2358>
<t2359>- Yes, please go and see, because that is my father up there.</t2359> <t2360>And perhaps you could help push the raft to the place with the light.</t2360> <t2361>He is sick, and so are my mother and Mary Anne.</t2361>
<t2362>- Oh, damn it, we're still in a hurry here.</t2362> <t2363>But maybe we should help a little.</t2363> <t2364>Dim, grab the oar.</t2364>
<t2365>I held the paddle and pushed the boat forward.</t2365> <t2366>They also went.</t2366> <t2367>After a few strokes, I said:</t2367>
<t2368>- My father will be very grateful to you.</t2368> <t2369>Everyone who was asked to help push it to the shore just left, and I couldn't do it alone.</t2369>
<t2370>- Oh, it's always like that. Really bad. Hey, kid, how's your dad's illness?</t2370>
<t2371>- uh... uh... it's not that dangerous</t2371>
<t2372>They stopped.</t2372> <t2373>There was only a short distance left to the shore.</t2373> <t2374>One person said:</t2374>
<t2375>- Kid, you're lying.</t2375> <t2376>What's wrong with your dad?</t2376> <t2377>Answer truthfully or don't blame me</t2377>
<t2378>- Yes, I... sir, I'm telling the truth... but please don't abandon us.</t2378> <t2379>Because... because it's... please, you go ahead, let me follow and then throw the end of the rope, please don't come near the raft, please wait!</t2379>
<t2380>- Back the boat, John, back it up - Someone said.</t2380> <t2381>They rowed the boat backward.</t2381> <t2382>Stay away, kid - move aside, hurry up.</t2382> <t2383>You little monkey, the wind might blow that thing onto us.</t2383> <t2384>Your father has smallpox, you probably know that already.</t2384> <t2385>Why didn't you say so right away?</t2385> <t2386>Do you want the disease to spread?</t2386>
<t2387>I stammered in reply:</t2387>
<t2388>- No, no, before I already told everyone, they ignored it, they abandoned us.</t2388>
<t2389>- Oh dear, there must be something wrong.</t2389> <t2390>We feel so sorry for you, but we...</t2390> <t2391>Never mind, let's not talk anymore, we don't want to catch smallpox, you hear?</t2391> <t2392>Look, I told you not to come ashore, if you do, you'll spread the disease everywhere.</t2392> <t2393>Row your boat about twenty miles down there and you'll reach a town on the left bank.</t2393> <t2394>By then it will be morning. Ask someone to guess if it's smallpox, you hear?</t2394> <t2395>Alright, now we'll help you with something.</t2395> <t2396>Just follow along here and sail down there, you're a good kid.</t2396> <t2397>Don't come ashore where there's light, it's just a wooden shed.</t2397> <t2398>Hey, maybe your dad is very poor, he must have had a lot of bad luck.</t2398> <t2399>Look, I'm leaving a gold coin worth two dollars on this plank here, when it floats to you, reach out and take it.</t2399> <t2400>Leaving you would be terrible, but dear God, I'm afraid of catching smallpox, you understand?</t2400>
<t2401>That person said again:</t2401>
<t2402>- Wait a minute, Packer. Hey, put the twenty-dollar bill on the plank for me.</t2402> <t2403>Alright, goodbye kid, just do as Mr. Packer told you and you'll be fine.</t2403>
<t2404>- That's right.</t2404> <t2405>Goodbye now, goodbye. If you see any black person running away, call someone to catch them, and you'll get money for it.</t2405>
<t2406>I replied:</t2406>
<t2407>- Yes, goodbye gentlemen.</t2407> <t2408>If I see any black man, I won't let him get away.</t2408>
<t2409>They left, and I returned to the raft, feeling despicable and cowardly, because I knew very well that I had done something wrong.</t2409> <t2410>I realized that for me, even if I learned to do the right thing, it would be useless, because a person who doesn't practice doing the right thing when young won't amount to anything when grown up.</t2410> <t2411>Later, during difficult times, there would be no one to help or support me, and I might even be beaten.</t2411> <t2412>I thought for a minute, then told myself: if earlier I hadn't done the wrong thing by bringing Jim out, would I feel more at ease now?</t2412> <t2413>But then I said: No.</t2413> <t2414>If that were the case, I would feel troubled, just as I am feeling troubled now.</t2414> <t2415>Then I told myself: what's the point of learning to do the right thing when doing the right thing brings distress and doing the wrong thing doesn't cause any discomfort?</t2415> <t2416>And aren't the benefits the same either way?</t2416> <t2417>I felt stuck, unable to answer that question.</t2417> <t2418>In the end, I thought there was no point in worrying about it anymore.</t2418> <t2419>However, it still kept lingering in my mind afterward.</t2419>
<t2420>I stepped into the tent.</t2420> <t2421>Jim wasn't there.</t2421> <t2422>I looked around, but didn't see him.</t2422> <t2423>I called out:</t2423>
<t2424>- Jim!</t2424>
<t2425>- I'm here, Huck.</t2425> <t2426>Have they gone far?</t2426> <t2427>Don't speak loudly.</t2427>
<t2428>It turns out Jim was hiding under the river, beneath the oar at the back, with only his nose sticking out above the water.</t2428> <t2429>I told him they had gone far away, and only then did he climb up.</t2429> <t2430>Jim said:</t2430>
<t2431>- I listened to the whole story, then I slipped down to the river and planned to swim to shore if they got on the raft.</t2431> <t2432>But after seeing them leave, I turned back.</t2432> <t2433>But how did you manage to fool them so well, Huck? You're really good at it.</t2433> <t2434>That means you saved Jim once again.</t2434> <t2435>Jim will never forget that, Huck.</t2435>
<t2436>Then we discussed money matters.</t2436> <t2437>It was quite a large sum, twenty dollars.</t2437> <t2438>Jim said now we could get a boat ticket, and that amount would be enough to reach free territories.</t2438> <t2439>He said traveling a few dozen miles by raft wouldn't take long, but he wanted to get there even faster.</t2439>
<t2440>At dawn, we tied the raft and Jim went to find a very clever hiding spot.</t2440> <t2441>Then, all day long, he diligently tied the belongings into bundles and got ready to leave the raft.</t2441>
<t2442>Around ten o'clock that night, we headed towards the town lights on the left bank of the river.</t2442> <t2443>I got off the boat and rowed out to ask for information. After a while, I met a person who was taking a small boat out to the river to set up fishing lines.</t2443> <t2444>I approached and asked:</t2444>
<t2445>- Grandpa, is that town over there Cairo?</t2445>
<t2446>- Where is Cairo?</t2446> <t2447>No! Are you crazy?</t2447>
<t2448>- What is that, sir?</t2448>
<t2449>- If you want to know, then go there and ask.</t2449> <t2450>If you stay here bothering me for even half a minute more, don't blame me.</t2450>
<t2451>I returned to the raft, Jim was extremely disappointed, but I told him it was okay, the place we were heading to could be Cairo.</t2451>
<t2452>We passed through another town before dawn.</t2452> <t2453>And I ventured out again, but this place only had mountains, so I didn't go any further.</t2453> <t2454>Jim said there are no mountains or hills in Cairo.</t2454> <t2455>I forgot about it too.</t2455> <t2456>During the day, we rested in a hollow on the bank above the river.</t2456> <t2457>I started to suspect something.</t2457> <t2458>So did Jim. I said:</t2458>
<t2459>- Or maybe we already passed through Cairo on that foggy night, Jim.</t2459>
<t2460>- Don't talk about that anymore, Huck.</t2460> <t2461>Poor black people never get lucky, do they?</t2461> <t2462>I still think that the snake skin hasn't brought its curse yet.</t2462>
<t2463>- If only we hadn't looked at that snake skin before, wouldn't it have been better, Jim?</t2463> <t2464>I think it would have been better if we hadn't looked at it.</t2464>
<t2465>- That's not your fault, Huck.</t2465> <t2466>It's because you didn't know.</t2466> <t2467>Don't blame yourself like that.</t2467>
<t2468>The sky is clear.</t2468> <t2469>This is indeed the green water of the Ohio River flowing inward here, and out there is the Muddy shore.</t2469> <t2470>So, the plan to go to Cairo is ruined.</t2470>
<t2471>We discussed it with each other for a long time. It wasn't advisable to go ashore now.</t2471> <t2472>Of course, pushing the raft upstream was not possible.</t2472> <t2473>There was no other way, we just had to wait until night, get into the boat, and go back to see if anything had happened.</t2473> <t2474>So we spent the whole day sleeping in the dense forest to regain our strength.</t2474> <t2475>By dusk, when we returned to the place where we had hidden the raft, we found that the boat had disappeared.</t2475>
<t2476>We fell silent for a moment, not saying a word.</t2476> <t2477>There was nothing left to say.</t2477> <t2478>Both of us understood that it was the snake's skin bringing bad luck, so there was no point in talking about it anymore.</t2478> <t2479>At that moment, it truly felt like we had done something wrong, and we thought that more misfortune would come our way.</t2479> <t2480>We kept thinking and remained silent.</t2480>
<t2481>But then, after a while, we discussed with each other how to proceed.</t2481> <t2482>And we couldn't find any other way but to keep paddling the raft downstream until we hopefully acquired a boat, then we would return.</t2482> <t2483>We didn't want to borrow a boat, because there was no one around.</t2483> <t2484>If it were my father, he would have borrowed one, but borrowing like that would make people aware and they would chase us.</t2484>
<t2485>When it was already dark, we crawled back onto the raft.</t2485>
<t2486>Those who still do not believe that touching a shed snake skin is extremely foolish and that the snake skin will bring harm afterwards, will now have to believe it if they see our current situation.</t2486>
<t2487>The place where you can buy a boat is only near where there are many rafts gathered by the riverbank.</t2487> <t2488>But we didn't see any place with many rafts gathered, so we had to continue for more than three hours.</t2488> <t2489>Night had begun to turn a faint gray, and that was a sign that fog was about to set in again.</t2489> <t2490>It was impossible to see the uneven riverbank clearly, and we couldn't see far anymore.</t2490> <t2491>It was very late at night and quiet.</t2491> <t2492>At that moment, a steamboat suddenly appeared, going upstream.</t2492> <t2493>We lit a lamp and thought that the steamboat would see us.</t2493> <t2494>Steamboats going upstream usually never go close to us; they stay far out and follow places where the water below isn't too swift.</t2494> <t2495>But on foggy nights like this, they just go straight ahead.</t2495>
<t2496>We could clearly hear the clattering sound but couldn't see the ship clearly until it got closer.</t2496> <t2497>The ship seemed to be heading straight towards us.</t2497> <t2498>They usually do this to see how close they can get without slowing down.</t2498> <t2499>Sometimes their paddle wheel breaks someone's oar, and then the helmsman sticks his head out and laughs, thinking it's quite amusing.</t2499> <t2500>As the ship approached, we thought it might hit us, and it didn't seem to be veering away at all.</t2500> <t2501>The ship was very large and moving quickly, looking like a big dark cloud bristling with paddle wheels and surrounded by fireflies.</t2501> <t2502>But then suddenly it swerved, looming menacingly, with a row of lit windows resembling a large set of red teeth, and its paddles and oars seemed ready to crash down on us.</t2502> <t2503>There were shouts, then a bell rang to slow the engine, followed by curses, the sound of the engine screeching, and just as Jim jumped to one side and I jumped to the other, the ship's paddle wheel smashed our raft to pieces.</t2503>
<t2504>I plunged into the water and dived deep to the riverbed, because the large wheel, which was about eight or nine meters in diameter, could potentially hit my head, and I needed to stay far away from it.</t2504> <t2505>I could stay underwater for up to a minute, but this time I thought I had been at the bottom for about a minute and a half.</t2505> <t2506>Then I surfaced, as I was nearly out of breath.</t2506> <t2507>I raised my hand to rub the water out of my nose, snorting a few times.</t2507> <t2508>Of course, in this spot, the water was swift, and the ship would start its engine as usual after about ten seconds, as they never cared about the fate of those on small boats.</t2508> <t2509>At that moment, the ship chugged away and disappeared into the fog, although I could still hear the engine's sound echoing back.</t2509>
<t2510>I called out to Jim dozens of times, but there was no response.</t2510> <t2511>Then I grabbed onto a nearby plank, kicked the water with my feet, and swam towards the shore, pushing the plank ahead of me.</t2511> <t2512>But suddenly I realized the water was pulling me towards the left bank, meaning I was going the wrong way, so I turned around and swam with the current.</t2512> <t2513>The river was about two miles wide, very far, and it took a long time to cross.</t2513> <t2514>I reached the riverbank safely, then climbed up onto the shore.</t2514> <t2515>In front of me, I saw only a small path, but I kept trudging along the rough ground for nearly half a mile, passing an old-style building with two wings, without even noticing when I had done so.</t2515>
<t2516>I was just about to run past when a pack of dogs came out of nowhere and started barking loudly at me.</t2516> <t2517>I knew I was in danger again.</t2517>
<t2518>Chapter XVII</t2518>
<t2519>About a minute later, there was a voice from the window without anyone sticking their head out:</t2519>
<t2520>- What are you doing? Who's there?</t2520>
<t2521>I replied:</t2521>
<t2522>- I'm here</t2522>
<t2523>- Who are you?</t2523>
<t2524>- Sir, I am George Jackson</t2524>
<t2525>- What do you want?</t2525>
<t2526>- I don't want anything, sir.</t2526> <t2527>I just want to pass through, but these dogs won't let me.</t2527>
<t2528>- What are you doing here, fumbling around in the middle of the night?</t2528>
<t2529>- Sir, I wasn't fumbling around at all.</t2529> <t2530>I was on the ship and just fell into the river.</t2530>
<t2531>- Oh, really? Can someone light the lamp a bit.</t2531> <t2532>What did you say your name was?</t2532>
<t2533>- George Jackson, sir.</t2533> <t2534>I'm just a boy.</t2534>
<t2535>- Hey, just tell the truth, there's nothing to be afraid of.</t2535> <t2536>No one will hit you.</t2536> <t2537>But don't move.</t2537> <t2538>Stay right where you are.</t2538> <t2539>Bod, Tom, someone get up and bring the gun here.</t2539> <t2540>George Jackson, is there anyone else with you?</t2540>
<t2541>- No, there is no one.</t2541>
<t2542>I heard the sound of someone rummaging in the house, then saw a light turn on.</t2542> <t2543>The person from earlier said:</t2543>
<t2544>- Move the lamp farther away, Betsy, how stupid, you don't know anything.</t2544> <t2545>Put the lamp on the floor, right behind the door.</t2545> <t2546>Bod, Tom, are you both ready? Sit down.</t2546>
<t2547>- Ready all</t2547>
<t2548>- So, George Jackson, do you know the Shepherdson family?</t2548>
<t2549>- No, sir, I have never heard of that name before</t2549>
<t2550>- Alright, maybe you haven't heard of it, or maybe you have.</t2550> <t2551>Okay, everything is ready.</t2551> <t2552>Step up, George Jackson.</t2552> <t2553>Be careful, don't rush, step very slowly.</t2553> <t2554>If someone is with you, make them stay back, if they step up, they will die.</t2554> <t2555>Now move forward, slowly.</t2555> <t2556>Push the door open yourself, just enough to slip through, understand?</t2556>
<t2557>I did not hastily step up, even if I wanted to, I couldn't.</t2557> <t2558>Each time, I only took one slow step without any noise, only hearing my heart beating.</t2558> <t2559>The dogs were as silent as the people, they followed me a little behind.</t2559> <t2560>Reaching the threshold, I heard the sound of unlocking, lifting the door bar, and pulling the latch.</t2560> <t2561>I placed my hand on the door, gently pushed a little, little by little.</t2561> <t2562>Then there was a voice:</t2562>
<t2563>- That's it, alright, stick your head in.</t2563> <t2564>I put my head in, but I was still worried inside, afraid they might cut off my head.</t2564>
<t2565>The candle was placed on the floor, and they were all standing around it.</t2565> <t2566>They looked at me, and I looked at them for nearly half a minute: three large men holding guns pointed at me, making me shiver, truly.</t2566> <t2567>The oldest person, with slightly gray hair, was about sixty; the second one was around thirty or a bit older, both looking handsome and composed.</t2567> <t2568>And a woman stood there, with graying hair and a small face.</t2568> <t2569>Standing behind the woman were two young women whom I couldn't see very clearly.</t2569> <t2570>The elderly man spoke:</t2570>
<t2571>- Okay, fine.</t2571> <t2572>Come in</t2572>
<t2573>As soon as I stepped in, that person immediately locked the door tightly, barring it with a horizontal latch, then told the young man to bring the gun.</t2573> <t2574>The whole group stepped into the next room, which had a new carpet laid out, then huddled in a corner near the window facing the street, and no one remained standing there anymore.</t2574> <t2575>Then they picked up the candle, looked at me carefully, and said:</t2575>
<t2576>- Oh, it's not the Shepherdsons.</t2576> <t2577>It doesn't look like the Shepherdsons at all.</t2577> <t2578>Then the older man told me not to worry about letting them search for any weapons - not because they meant any harm to me, but just to be sure.</t2578> <t2579>He didn't put his hands in my pockets but just felt around the outside, then said: all right.</t2579> <t2580>He told me to make myself at home now, and talked about all sorts of things about sin too.</t2580> <t2581>But the middle-aged woman said:</t2581>
<t2582>- Oh dear, Mr. Saul, the boy is soaking wet like this.</t2582> <t2583>And perhaps he's still hungry too?</t2583>
<t2584>- Yes, that's right, Rachel, I forgot.</t2584>
<t2585>The woman said:</t2585>
<t2586>- Betsy (this is a black woman), ran to find something for him to eat, poor boy, while another girl went to wake Buck up, telling him, oh never mind, here he is.</t2586> <t2587>Buck, take this boy and change his wet clothes, and put some of your dry clothes on him.</t2587>
<t2588>Buck was about my age, thirteen or fourteen, though he was a bit bigger than me.</t2588> <t2589>He was only wearing a shirt, and his hair was very dirty.</t2589> <t2590>He walked over, yawning and rubbing his eyes with one hand, while dragging a gun with the other.</t2590> <t2591>He asked:</t2591>
<t2592>- There aren't any Shepherdsons out there, are there?</t2592>
<t2593>The whole group said:</t2593>
<t2594>- No, it's just a false alarm</t2594>
<t2595>It said:</t2595>
<t2596>- I thought if there were any of them, I would have caught one</t2596>
<t2597>Everyone laughed.</t2597> <t2598>Bod said:</t2598>
<t2599>- Hey, Buck, but you're too late, they might catch all of us.</t2599>
<t2600>- After dark, there's no one left?</t2600> <t2601>That's not acceptable.</t2601> <t2602>I'm always left behind like this, never getting to see anything.</t2602>
<t2603>Don't worry, Buck my child - The old man said.</t2603> <t2604>Then you will be free, don't worry.</t2604> <t2605>Now go, do as your mother told you.</t2605>
<t2606>We went upstairs, into the room with Buck, he started to get dressed.</t2606> <t2607>After getting dressed, he asked me what my name was, before I could answer, he showed me a blackbird and a rabbit he had just caught in the forest the day before yesterday, then asked me where Moses was when the candle went out.</t2607>
<t2608>I said I didn't know and had never heard of that before.</t2608> <t2609>He said:</t2609>
<t2610>- So, try to guess</t2610>
<t2611>I answered:</t2611>
<t2612>- How could I have guessed, since I had never heard of it before</t2612>
<t2613>- But you can guess, it's very easy</t2613>
<t2614>I asked:</t2614>
<t2615>- Which candle? I don't know where it is. Where?</t2615>
<t2616>- Oh, it's in my place, where else</t2616>
<t2617>- Oh, if you already know where it is, then why do you still need to ask me?</t2617>
<t2618>- Damn it, it's a riddle, don't you see?</t2618> <t2619>Hey, how long do you plan to stay here? You have to stay here forever.</t2619> <t2620>We can go hunting as much as we want, now we don't have to go to school anymore.</t2620> <t2621>Do you have any dogs?</t2621> <t2622>I have a dog, I take it to the river, if I throw something into the river, it will swim out and retrieve it.</t2622> <t2623>Do you like exploring on Sundays?</t2623> <t2624>And running around playing with things like that?</t2624> <t2625>You probably don't like it, but I love it.</t2625> <t2626>Put these on too.</t2626> <t2627>Maybe I'll put some more on too.</t2627> <t2628>But never mind, it's too hot.</t2628> <t2629>Are you done? Alright, let's go, my friend.</t2629>
<t2630>The bread was cold, and the beef was also cold.</t2630> <t2631>Then there was butter and milk bread.</t2631> <t2632>They had prepared those things for me.</t2632> <t2633>And it was much better than what I had eaten before.</t2633> <t2634>Buck, his mother, and the whole family smoked with small pipes, except for the black woman from earlier and the two young women.</t2634> <t2635>The whole family smoked and talked.</t2635> <t2636>I ate and talked as well.</t2636> <t2637>The two young women sat among the spools of thread, their hair falling down their backs.</t2637> <t2638>Everyone asked me questions.</t2638> <t2639>I told them that my father and family lived on a small farm at the far end of Arkansas.</t2639> <t2640>My sister Mary Ann got married and we lost contact with her.</t2640> <t2641>Then Bill went to find my sister and her husband but never returned with any news.</t2641> <t2642>Tom and Mort had died; later, it was just my father and me, but my father fell into hard times and had nothing left; so after he died, I gathered what little was left and left.</t2642> <t2643>Since the farm wasn't ours, I went to the river to catch a boat, but somehow I fell into the river and ended up here.</t2643> <t2644>They told me to consider this place my home and stay as long as I wanted.</t2644> <t2645>By then it was nearly morning, everyone went to sleep, and I slept with Buck. When I woke up, it was late, and I had completely forgotten my own name, can you believe it?</t2645> <t2646>I lay there for an hour, trying to remember.</t2646> <t2647>When Buck woke up, I asked:</t2647>
<t2648>- Buck, can you spell?</t2648>
<t2649>- Okay, it replied</t2649>
<t2650>- I bet you can't even spell my name, I said.</t2650> <t2651>It replied:</t2651>
<t2652>- I told you, whatever you dare to do, I can do it too</t2652>
<t2653>- Okay, let's see you try to spell it out for me</t2653>
<t2654>- G-e-o-r-g-e.</t2654> <t2655>J-a-c-k-s-o-n, see for yourself</t2655>
<t2656>- Good, that's right.</t2656> <t2657>I thought you couldn't spell it.</t2657> <t2658>That name isn't too cumbersome to spell, you can read it right away without having to think about it.</t2658>
<t2659>I remember it carefully in my mind, so that if someone asks me to spell it later, I can quickly say it, acting as if I am very familiar with my own name.</t2659>
<t2660>This is quite a kind family.</t2660> <t2661>And this house is also very charming.</t2661> <t2662>I have not seen any house in this area as beautiful and stylish as this one.</t2662> <t2663>On the front door, there is no iron or wooden latch tied with a deer leather strap, but instead, there is a brass knob to turn, just like the houses in the city.</t2663> <t2664>In the living room, besides the bed, there is nothing else used as a bed.</t2664> <t2665>There are many such rooms in the province where they place beds.</t2665> <t2666>There is a large fireplace, with tiles laid underneath, and the surrounding tiles are very clean and bright red because they pour water on them and scrub them with other tiles.</t2666> <t2667>Sometimes people paint a red coat, commonly called Spanish brown, just like the houses in the city.</t2667> <t2668>There are large brass dogs that can support entire house columns. In the middle of the fireplace mantel, there is a clock, a cityscape painting on the lower half of the glass, and a round hollow in the middle to represent the sun, through which you can see the pendulum swinging back and forth.</t2668> <t2669>The clock chimes beautifully, and occasionally, a traveling repairman passes by, comes in to clean it, and adjusts it correctly, making it chime continuously for one hundred and ten times until it is taken apart.</t2669> <t2670>The homeowner is not easy to sell it at any price.</t2670>
<t2671>Then on either side of the clock, there were very strange-looking parrots, made of something like makeup, painted in bright colors.</t2671>
<t2672>Next to the parrot on one side, there is a porcelain cat, and on the other side, there is a porcelain dog; every time you press its head, it lets out a squeak, but it doesn't open its mouth, nor does it show any signs of anger or joy.</t2672> <t2673>It squeaks from its bottom.</t2673> <t2674>Because there are two fans made from pheasant wings installed at the back.</t2674> <t2675>On the table in the middle of the room, there is a very beautiful porcelain bowl, filled with apples, oranges, peaches, and grapes, looking red and yellow and more beautiful than usual fruits; but they are not real fruits and you can see spots where the outer layer has peeled off, exposing the white clay inside.</t2675>
<t2676>On the table covered with an oilcloth tablecloth, beautiful, in the middle of the cloth is painted a blue and red eagle, with a border painted around it.</t2676> <t2677>They said that the cloth was brought back from Philadelphia. There were also a few books, carefully arranged in the corners of the table.</t2677> <t2678>One book was a Bible with many illustrations.</t2678> <t2679>Another book was "The Pilgrim's Progress," about a man who left home without saying why.</t2679> <t2680>Occasionally, I still read this story.</t2680> <t2681>But the words in it are quite good, though a bit rough.</t2681> <t2682>Another book was "Sacrifice for Friends," which had many good stories and poems, but I don't read poetry.</t2682> <t2683>One book was "The Speeches of Henry Clay," and another was "Gunn's Domestic Medicine," which talked about everything we need to do when someone in the house is sick or dies.</t2683> <t2684>Then there was a book about hymns, and a bunch of other books.</t2684> <t2685>There were also some very cute little chairs, with legs splayed out, and very sturdy to sit on, the seat not sagging or sunken like an old basket.</t2685>
<t2686>They even have paintings hanging on the walls - especially paintings of Washingtons and Lafayettes depicting battles, depicting the Mary plateau, and a painting called The Signing of the Declaration.</t2686><t2687>There are some paintings they call sketches, one of which depicts one of the daughters of this family who has passed away; she drew it herself when she was just fifteen years old.</t2687><t2688>These paintings are different from any paintings I had seen before - they are mostly darker than usual paintings.</t2688><t2689>One depicts a woman in a thin black dress, cinched under the arms, with cabbage-like flares at the wrists, wearing a bonnet with a black veil falling down, with two white ankles wrapped in black ribbons, wearing black shoes as small as blades; the woman in the painting is leaning down sorrowfully beside a tombstone on the right, under a weeping willow, holding a white handkerchief in one hand and a woven basket in the other; under the painting, it is written: Alas, I shall never see you again!</t2689><t2690>Another painting depicts a young woman with all her hair combed up to the top of her head, tied in a knot in front with a comb that looks like the back of a chair, she is crying, face buried in a handkerchief, with a dead bird lying on its back in her other hand, legs upturned, and under the painting, it is written: Alas, I shall never hear you sing again! Then there is another painting of a young woman sitting by a window looking at the moon, tears streaming down her cheeks: one hand holding an open letter with a black seal on one side, lifting a small framed picture to her mouth with a string; under the painting, it is written: Is it true that you are leaving, oh my love!</t2690><t2691>All those paintings are beautiful, I am sure, but somehow I do not like them much.</t2691><t2692>Because whenever I am sad, they make me feel even heavier.</t2692><t2693>Everyone regretted that she died, because she was planning to paint many more such paintings.</t2693><t2694>Everyone felt that she had gained something while everyone else had lost something.</t2694><t2695>But I think that with her temperament, it was better for her to rest in the cemetery.</t2695><t2696>She only prayed to live long enough to finish that painting, but she still did not survive.</t2696><t2697>It was a painting of a young woman in a long white dress, standing by the bridge, about to jump into the river, hair flowing down her back, face turned up looking at the moon, tears streaming down, arms crossed in front of her chest, with two other arms reaching forward, and two more arms reaching up towards the moon - the idea was to see which pair of arms was better, and the others would be erased.</t2697><t2698>But as I mentioned earlier, she died before making a final decision; and now they still keep that painting hanging over her bed in her room.</t2698><t2699>Every year on her birthday, they decorate that painting with flowers.</t2699><t2700>There used to be a curtain covering it.</t2700><t2701>The young woman in the painting has a small and pretty face, but because of the many arms, she looks like a spider, that's how I see it.</t2701>
<t2702>This young woman, when she was alive, had a notebook in which she kept pressed leaves and often copied stories or confessions of the sick from the Presbyterian Observer magazine, then wrote poems inspired by her own thoughts beneath them.</t2702> <t2703>The poems were quite remarkable.</t2703> <t2704>Below is a poem she wrote about a boy named Stephen Dowling Bost who fell into a well and died:</t2704>
<t2705>the poem mourning Stephen Dowling Bost who has died.</t2705>
<t2706>Is Stephen sick?</t2706>
<t2707>Did Stephen die?</t2707>
<t2708>Do sad hearts grow heavier</t2708>
<t2709>Are those the people who made you cry?</t2709>
<t2710>No, it's not fate.</t2710>
<t2711>Stephen Dowling Bost's belongings.</t2711>
<t2712>Even though the hearts around you are heavy</t2712>
<t2713>It's not because of illness either, dear.</t2713>
<t2714>No sobbing sound can mend your image.</t2714>
<t2715>Nothing can erase the pain.</t2715>
<t2716>Nothing can make up for your name.</t2716>
<t2717>Oh Stephen Dowling Bost.</t2717>
<t2718>Despite the pain, love remains unbroken.</t2718>
<t2719>The head still has a full set of hair.</t2719>
<t2720>Despite the pain in my gut, it made me fall down.</t2720>
<t2721>I am still Stephen Dowling Bost.</t2721>
<t2722>Oh, no! Look with tearful eyes.</t2722>
<t2723>When we hear stories about your fate.</t2723>
<t2724>The soul flies up to the cold world.</t2724>
<t2725>When you fall into the well.</t2725>
<t2726>Lift me up and drain the water from my body.</t2726>
<t2727>But it was already too late for me.</t2727>
<t2728>My soul has flown to a place unseen.</t2728>
<t2729>where, good, great?</t2729>
<t2730>If Miss Emmeline Grangerford could write such poems at the age of fourteen, one wonders what she might have accomplished later on.</t2730> <t2731>Buck said that she could scribble out a poem as easily as playing.</t2731> <t2732>She was always thinking.</t2732> <t2733>He said she would jot down a line, and if she couldn't find another line to rhyme with it, she would erase it immediately and come up with another one, and so on.</t2733> <t2734>She had a particular liking for something, could write anything she chose, and if you asked her to write something, she would.</t2734> <t2735>But it had to be sad poetry.</t2735> <t2736>Whenever someone died, whether a man, woman, or child, she would write something to mourn the deceased before the body turned cold.</t2736> <t2737>She called these eulogies.</t2737> <t2738>The neighbors said that in order, it was first the doctor, then Emmeline, and they would arrive at the same time.</t2738> <t2739>Then she would enthusiastically come up with a rhyme for the deceased's name, calling it a Whistler.</t2739> <t2740>Later on, she gradually changed, never complained, but she kept wasting away and couldn't live any longer.</t2740> <t2741>It's so sad, many times I went up to the room where she used to work, took out her notebook to look at, and seeing the pictures she drew made me feel sad and pity her.</t2741> <t2742>I loved this family, even the deceased, all of them, and I didn't let anything happen.</t2742> <t2743>Poor Miss Emmeline, when she was alive, she wrote poems about the dead, but no one wrote any poems about her.</t2743> <t2744>So, I tried to rack my brain to think of a few lines, but I couldn't come up with anything.</t2744> <t2745>This family kept Miss Emmeline's room very clean and tidy, and everything was left as she liked it when she was alive, and no one slept there.</t2745> <t2746>Her mother herself cleaned and took care of this room, even though there were many black servants in the house.</t2746> <t2747>She would go into this room to sew and often read prayers there.</t2747>
<t2748>Quyen, I am talking about the living room.</t2748> <t2749>There are many windows here, white curtains with drawings of ancient castles, grapevines around the walls with herds of cows and horses drinking water.</t2749> <t2750>There is a small old piano, which I am sure contains pots and pans.</t2750> <t2751>Whenever the ladies in the house sing the song "The Last Ties Have Broken" or play "The Battle of Prague," nothing could be more delightful.</t2751> <t2752>The walls around the rooms are all plastered, and almost every room has carpets on the floor.</t2752> <t2753>And the entire house is whitewashed on the outside.</t2753>
<t2754>It is a house with two kitchens.</t2754> <t2755>The space between the two kitchens is covered and carefully wooden-floored.</t2755> <t2756>Sometimes at noon, placing a table there to sit is very cool and very enjoyable.</t2756> <t2757>There is nothing better than that.</t2757> <t2758>And if the meals are delicious, it would be wonderful, nothing could compare.</t2758>
<t2759>Chapter XVIII</t2759>
<t2760>Colonel Grangerford was an aristocrat, you see.</t2760><t2761>He was an aristocrat in every way: so was his whole family.</t2761><t2762>He came from a noble background, as people often say, and that is as valuable for a person as it is for a horse; as Widow Douglas used to say, and no one could deny that she was the top aristocrat in the province.</t2762><t2763>My father used to say the same thing, although my father was no more valuable than a stray cat.</t2763><t2764>Colonel Grangerford was tall but slender.</t2764><t2765>He had a dusky, oily complexion, and his whole face lacked any rosy hue.</t2765><t2766>Every morning, he shaved his entire gaunt face smooth.</t2766><t2767>He had the thinnest lips, the smallest nostrils, a prominent nose, bushy eyebrows, the blackest eyes set so deep it seemed as if they were looking at you from a dark cavern, so to speak.</t2767><t2768>His forehead was high, his hair grizzled, straight, and hanging down to his shoulders.</t2768><t2769>His hands were both thin and long.</t2769><t2770>Throughout his life, each day he wore a white undershirt and a suit made entirely of white flannel, dazzling to the eyes.</t2770><t2771>Then on Sundays, he added a blue tailcoat with brass buttons.</t2771><t2772>He carried a peachwood cane with a silver handle.</t2772><t2773>He never appeared careless in the slightest, nor did he ever show anger towards anyone.</t2773><t2774>He tried to be good to everyone, and you could feel that, which made you trust him.</t2774><t2775>Occasionally, he smiled, and it was truly charming.</t2775><t2776>But when he stood up straight like the Statue of Liberty, and a gleam began to shine from beneath his eyebrows, you might want to find a tree to climb up immediately, knowing something was about to happen.</t2776><t2777>He didn't need to tell people to behave - yet wherever he went, everyone was obedient.</t2777><t2778>Everyone liked having him around - he was like sunlight - I mean to say, it was like encountering good weather.</t2778><t2779>When the sun went behind a cloud, it darkened for half a minute, and that was all.</t2779><t2780>Then for about a week, nothing happened at all.</t2780>
<t2781>In the morning, when he and his wife came downstairs, everyone stood up to greet them.</t2781> <t2782>Before they came down, no one in the house dared to sit.</t2782> <t2783>Then Tom and Bod went to the liquor cabinet, mixed several types of alcohol together, and brought it to him.</t2783> <t2784>He took it in his hand, waited for Tom and Bod to finish pouring everything, and after both of them bowed and said: "Please, father and mother," and greeted in every possible way, then expressed their thanks, everyone finally drank together.</t2784> <t2785>After that, Tom and Bod poured a spoonful of water into the sugar, added a bit of sugar to the whiskey or brandy at the bottom of the glass, handed it to me and Buck, and then it was our turn to drink and toast the couple as well.</t2785>
<t2786>Bob is the eldest.</t2786> <t2787>Then comes Tom, both of them tall, handsome, broad-shouldered, with tanned faces, black long hair, and black eyes as well.</t2787> <t2788>Both of them wore white woolen clothes, from head to toe, just like that upper-class old man, and wide-brimmed straw hats.</t2788>
<t2789>Then it was Charlotte's turn.</t2789> <t2790>She was twenty-five years old, tall, and proud; whenever she wasn't losing her temper, she tried to be kind.</t2790> <t2791>But when she did lose her temper, she could make you tremble in your boots, just like her father.</t2791> <t2792>She was quite beautiful.</t2792>
<t2793>As for her younger sister, Sophia, she was completely different from her.</t2793> <t2794>She was very gentle and as pleasant as a dove.</t2794> <t2795>She was only twenty years old.</t2795> <t2796>Each person in the house had their own black servant.</t2796> <t2797>Even young Buck had one.</t2797> <t2798>The black servant they assigned to me had plenty of free time, because I never wanted anyone to do anything for me.</t2798> <t2799>But young Buck was always ordering people around, yelling all the time.</t2799>
<t2800>Those are all the people present in the family.</t2800> <t2801>There should have been more, but the three eldest sons were all killed, and Miss Emmeline has also passed away.</t2801>
<t2802>This upper-class old man has several farms with over a hundred black people working.</t2802> <t2803>Occasionally, a group of people would come there, riding horses from a place ten to fifteen miles away.</t2803> <t2804>They would stay for five or six days, eating and drinking abundantly on the river or around the house, dancing, and frolicking in the woods during the day.</t2804> <t2805>Then at night, they would come into the house and dance again.</t2805> <t2806>Most of these people were relatives of the family.</t2806> <t2807>They also brought guns with them.</t2807> <t2808>And it must be said that these were all high-quality and beautiful guns.</t2808>
<t2809>There was another noble family nearby, about five or six families mostly bearing the surname Shepherdsons.</t2809> <t2810>They were also renowned, also of noble lineage, wealthy, and as grand as the Grangerfords, all sharing a steamboat landing about two miles from our house.</t2810> <t2811>Occasionally, I would go there with some people from this house, and often saw a group of Shepherdsons riding very beautiful horses passing by.</t2811>
<t2812>One day Buck and I went into the forest to hunt, when suddenly we heard the sound of a horse approaching.</t2812> <t2813>We were crossing the road when Buck said:</t2813>
<t2814>- Quickly, jump into the forest!</t2814>
<t2815>We jumped into the forest, hiding in the bushes and peering through the leaves outside.</t2815> <t2816>A moment later, a young, handsome man rode a horse in this direction, sitting firmly on the horse like a skilled cavalryman.</t2816> <t2817>He had a gun strapped to the front of his saddle.</t2817> <t2818>I had met him once before.</t2818> <t2819>It was Harney Shepherdsons.</t2819> <t2820>Suddenly, a gunshot from Buck whizzed past my ear, and Harney's hat flew off his head. He quickly grabbed his gun and charged his horse towards the source of the shot.</t2820> <t2821>But we didn't wait.</t2821> <t2822>We leaped through the forest and ran away.</t2822> <t2823>The forest wasn't very dense, so I could run while glancing back to avoid bullets.</t2823> <t2824>Twice I saw Harney aim his gun at Buck but then he lost sight of him.</t2824> <t2825>We ran straight back home.</t2825> <t2826>The old gentleman looked at us, his eyes brightening a bit, seemingly pleased, I guessed.</t2826> <t2827>But then his face fell, and he spoke in a gentle tone:</t2827>
<t2828>- I don't like the way you shoot from the bushes like that.</t2828> <t2829>Why don't you stand in the middle of the road and shoot?</t2829>
<t2830>-The Shepherdsons are the same, Dad. They always look for an advantageous position.</t2830>
<t2831>Miss Charlotte listened to Buck recount the story, raising her head like a queen, her nostrils flaring and her eyes twinkling.</t2831> <t2832>The two sons had darkened expressions but said nothing. Miss Sophia turned pale, but when she heard that the other person was not hit, she returned to her usual self.</t2832>
<t2833>Later, I took Buck down to the mill, sat under the shade of a tree, and had a private conversation.</t2833> <t2834>I asked:</t2834>
<t2835>- At that moment, were you really planning to kill him?</t2835> <t2836>Buck?</t2836>
<t2837>- Are you really sure?</t2837>
<t2838>- So what did it do to you?</t2838>
<t2839>- It?</t2839> <t2840>It has never done anything to me.</t2840>
<t2841>- Uh, so why do you intend to kill it?</t2841>
<t2842>- What is a plantation?</t2842>
<t2843>- Oh my, where did you grow up that you don't know what a plantation is?</t2843>
<t2844>- I've never heard of that before.</t2844> <t2845>Try telling me about it.</t2845>
<t2846>Buck said</t2846>
<t2847>- This is how it is, a plantation is like this: One person has a conflict with another person, then kills them.</t2847> <t2848>Then the siblings of the person who was killed take revenge.</t2848> <t2849>Then the siblings of this person kill the other person.</t2849> <t2850>Both sides keep killing each other like that endlessly.</t2850> <t2851>Eventually, even their relatives get involved, and gradually everyone gets killed, so there is no more plantation.</t2851> <t2852>But that is a long story.</t2852>
<t2853>- So, how long has this been going on, Buck?</t2853>
<t2854>- Yeah, I think it's probably been a long time.</t2854> <t2855>It's been thirty years now, or maybe even more.</t2855> <t2856>There was some complicated matter, then there was some lawsuit that needed to be resolved, and the court sentenced one of the people involved. So this person stood up and shot the one who was sued, and that was natural, anyone would do that.</t2856>
<t2857>- What's the trouble, Buck?</t2857> <t2858>Is it the land?</t2858>
<t2859>- Maybe so, I don't really know either</t2859>
<t2860>- So, who shot at that time?</t2860> <t2861>Someone from my family found out.</t2861> <t2862>It was a long time ago.</t2862>
<t2863>- So no one knows</t2863><t2864>?</t2864>
<t2865>- Oh, yes, my father knows, I'm sure of it, and the people in this house know too.</t2865> <t2866>But now they don't know how the fight started from the beginning.</t2866>
<t2867>- Have many people been killed yet, Buck?</t2867>
<t2868>- Yes, many times we almost had to hold a funeral.</t2868> <t2869>But it's not always possible to shoot him dead.</t2869> <t2870>My father also has a few bullets in him, but he doesn't mind, because they are just small bullets.</t2870> <t2871>Bod was stabbed with a hunting knife, and Tom has also been shot a few times.</t2871>
<t2872>- So, did anyone get killed this year, Buck?</t2872>
<t2873>- Yes, on our side we killed one person, and on their side, they also killed one person.</t2873> <t2874>About three months ago, my cousin Bud, who was only fourteen years old, was riding a horse in the forest across the river. He didn't carry any weapons with him, which was so foolish. While he was in a deserted spot, he heard the sound of a horse behind him. Turning around, he saw old Baldy Shepherdson chasing him, holding a gun, with his white hair blowing in the wind.</t2874> <t2875>Instead of jumping aside and running into the forest, Bud just kept riding his horse forward. So the two of them kept chasing each other for more than five miles.</t2875> <t2876>The old man kept trying to get ahead but couldn't.</t2876> <t2877>Finally, Bud saw that it was useless, so he stopped his horse so that if he had to take a bullet, it would be from the front, you understand.</t2877> <t2878>So the old man got ahead and shot him dead.</t2878> <t2879>But then the old man wasn't lucky for long, because within a week, the people from our side sent him to his maker.</t2879>
<t2880>- I made that old man a coward, Buck</t2880>
<t2881>- No, he's not a coward.</t2881> <t2882>Just look at him and you'll know.</t2882> <t2883>Among the Shepherdsons, there's no one who's cowardly.</t2883> <t2884>And in the Grangerford family, there's no one who's cowardly either.</t2884> <t2885>You know, one day that old man fought against four Grangerford men for half an hour and in the end, he won the battle.</t2885> <t2886>They were all on horseback, he jumped off his horse and hid behind a pile of wood, using his horse as a shield.</t2886> <t2887>The Grangerford men stayed on their horses, surrounding him and aiming to shoot.</t2887> <t2888>He shot back at them too.</t2888> <t2889>After that, both he and his horse managed to get home, covered in blood, limping; but the Grangerford men had to be carried back.</t2889> <t2890>One died immediately, and another died the next day.</t2890> <t2891>No, sir, if the battlefield were filled with cowards, they would never dare to confront the Grangerfords; and no one would keep such people around either.</t2891>
<t2892>That Sunday, we went to church, which was about three or five miles from home.</t2892> <t2893>Everyone went on horseback.</t2893> <t2894>Each person carried a gun, including Buck.</t2894> <t2895>Buck kept his gun on his thigh or leaned it against the wall within arm's reach.</t2895> <t2896>But the Shepherdsons did the same.</t2896> <t2897>It was really just outward prayer, talking about loving each other like brothers, and other phrases like that, which made me sick to hear, but then everyone said that praying like that was very good, and even on the way back home, they kept saying the same, talking a lot about loyalty, goodness, and other things I didn't even understand.</t2897> <t2898>And I felt that this was one of the most boring Sundays I had ever experienced.</t2898>
<t2899>About an hour after lunch, everyone dispersed.</t2899> <t2900>Some sat on chairs, some went to their private rooms, and the atmosphere was really dull.</t2900> <t2901>Buck, with a dog, lay sprawled on the porch sleeping under the sun.</t2901> <t2902>I also went up to my room and thought I should take a nap.</t2902> <t2903>Teacher Sophia, kind-hearted, was standing at the door next to our room.</t2903> <t2904>She pulled me into her private room, gently closed the door, and asked if I liked her.</t2904> <t2905>I said I did.</t2905> <t2906>She asked me to do her a favor and not to tell anyone.</t2906> <t2907>I said okay.</t2907> <t2908>Then she said she had left the Bible on the church bench along with two other books, and asked me to quietly go out and fetch them for her; and remember not to tell anyone.</t2908> <t2909>I said okay, I'll go get them for you.</t2909> <t2910>I sneaked out of the house and ran straight there.</t2910> <t2911>There was no one in the church, maybe just a few pigs.</t2911> <t2912>Because the church door was not closed, and in the summer, pigs liked the high wooden floor in the church, which was cooler.</t2912> <t2913>If you pay attention, you'll see; many people only stop going to church when they absolutely can't, but pigs are different.</t2913>
<t2914>I told myself that there must be something going on.</t2914> <t2915>A girl getting all worked up about forgetting a Bible like this is not natural.</t2915> <t2916>I shook the book, and a small piece of paper with pencil writing fell out, reading "Two thirty."</t2916> <t2917>I searched again, but found nothing else.</t2917> <t2918>I couldn't figure out what it was, so I put the piece of paper back.</t2918> <t2919>When I returned home, I went upstairs and saw Sophia still waiting for me at the door.</t2919> <t2920>She pulled me in, closed the door, then found the piece of paper in the book, and after reading it, she seemed delighted.</t2920> <t2921>Suddenly, before I could think of anything, she grabbed my hand and told me I was the best boy in the world, and asked me not to tell anyone.</t2921> <t2922>She blushed for a moment, her eyes brightened, and at that moment, she looked incredibly beautiful.</t2922> <t2923>I was surprised, but after calming down, I asked what the piece of paper was about.</t2923> <t2924>She asked if I had read the writing, I said no, I had just started learning to write, and she said that the piece of paper was just a bookmark for where she had left off reading, then told me I could go outside and play.</t2924>
<t2925>I went down to the riverbank, thinking about this matter.</t2925> <t2926>Suddenly, I saw my black friend following behind.</t2926> <t2927>When we reached a hidden spot out of sight from the house, he turned back for a second, then ran to me and said:</t2927>
<t2928>- George, if you go down to the pond over there, I'll show you a bunch of otters.</t2928>
<t2929>I thought to myself, how strange, he mentioned that yesterday.</t2929> <t2930>He also knows that no one really likes otters and no one hunts them either.</t2930> <t2931>But why did he say that? I asked;</t2931>
<t2932>- Alright, you go ahead</t2932>
<t2933>I followed him for half a mile, then turned towards the pond, having to wade through ankle-deep water for another half mile: we reached a flat area that was both high and dry, with many trees, bushes, and even some grass.</t2933> <t2934>He said:</t2934>
<t2935>- George, please step a few steps further inside.</t2935> <t2936>It's in there.</t2936> <t2937>I've seen it before, I don't need to look again now.</t2937>
<t2938>After speaking, he immediately ran away and disappeared behind a cluster of trees.</t2938> <t2939>I stepped inside, to an open space about the size of a room, surrounded by grape leaves, and suddenly saw someone sleeping there.</t2939> <t2940>Oh my God, it turned out to be my Jim!</t2940>
<t2941>I woke Jim up, and I guessed that when he saw me, he would be terrified again.</t2941> <t2942>But no.</t2942> <t2943>He was just so happy he was nearly crying, without being surprised at all.</t2943> <t2944>He recounted that that night he swam after me and heard me call out a few times but didn't respond, because he was afraid someone would recognize him and take him back to be a slave again.</t2944> <t2945>He said:</t2945>
<t2946>- I was in a bit of pain so I couldn't swim fast, and you left me far behind.</t2946> <t2947>When you got ashore, I thought I could catch up with you on land without having to call out.</t2947> <t2948>But when I saw that building, I started to slow down.</t2948> <t2949>I stood far away so I couldn't hear what they were saying to you; I was also afraid of the pack of dogs.</t2949> <t2950>When everything went quiet, I knew you had gone inside that house.</t2950> <t2951>So I went out into the forest and waited for you all day.</t2951> <t2952>Early the next morning, some black people going to work in the fields found me and showed me this hiding spot.</t2952> <t2953>This place has a water pond separating it from the inside, so the dogs can't catch the scent.</t2953> <t2954>Every night, they bring me some food, and they tell me about how you are doing in there.</t2954>
<t2955>- Why didn't you tell Jack to bring me out here earlier, Jim?</t2955>
<t2956>- Didn't want to bother you, Huck.</t2956> <t2957>You said you couldn't do anything, but now I'm relieved.</t2957> <t2958>I've bought pots, pans, and enough food.</t2958> <t2959>How fortunate.</t2959> <t2960>Every night I sneak out to patch up the raft, I...</t2960>
<t2961>- Well, Jim?</t2961>
<t2962>- Our old pond</t2962>
<t2963>- So, does that mean our raft didn't get destroyed?</t2963>
<t2964>- No, not at all.</t2964> <t2965>It only broke partially.</t2965> <t2966>One end is still intact, nothing happened to it.</t2966> <t2967>If we hadn't dived too deep, if that night we had been a bit braver instead of scared as the saying goes, we could have kept the raft.</t2967> <t2968>But don't worry, because now it's almost as good as new, and we have a bunch of other things too, right where we lost them.</t2968>
<t2969>- How did you manage to find the raft, Jim, did you chase after it</t2969><t2970>?</t2970>
<t2971>- How could I chase after it while lying in this forest?</t2971><t2972>No, my friend, some of the guys found it stuck in a nearby field.</t2972><t2973>They hid it in a hollow under a willow bush, then they argued and debated for a long time about whose raft it was.</t2973><t2974>Just at that moment, I came over and told them that the raft didn't belong to anyone, but to you and me.</t2974><t2975>I asked if they intended to take the property of an upper-class white man by hiding it like that.</t2975><t2976>Then I gave each of them a dime; everyone was very satisfied.</t2976><t2977>Then I told them that if any other rafts floated by, they would get more money.</t2977><t2978>They treated me very well, my friend! But those black guys, you know.</t2978><t2979>Whenever I needed their help, I didn't have to ask twice, my friend.</t2979><t2980>That guy Jack is a good black man, and he's quite quick too.</t2980>
<t2981>- Yes, he's good.</t2981> <t2982>He never told me that you were here.</t2982> <t2983>He told me to come here so he could show me the otters.</t2983> <t2984>If anything happens, he won't be implicated.</t2984> <t2985>He can say that he has never seen us together, and people will believe it.</t2985>
<t2986>I don't want to talk much about what happened the next day.</t2986> <t2987>I'll just briefly recount it like this: I woke up at dawn, intending to go back to sleep when I suddenly noticed it was very quiet, as if no one was stirring at all.</t2987> <t2988>That was a bit unusual.</t2988> <t2989>Then I saw that Buck had gotten up and left at some point.</t2989> <t2990>I jumped up, feeling strange, and went downstairs.</t2990> <t2991>There was no one there.</t2991> <t2992>Everything was silent.</t2992> <t2993>It was the same outside. I didn't understand what was going on.</t2993> <t2994>Stepping out to the woodpile, I went to ask Jack:</t2994>
<t2995>- What's going on?</t2995>
<t2996>He replied:</t2996>
<t2997>- You don't know?</t2997>
<t2998>- Yes.</t2998> <t2999>Miss Sophia, she has run away.</t2999> <t3000>She really has run away.</t3000> <t3001>She ran away in the middle of the night, no one knew.</t3001> <t3002>She ran away to marry that guy Harney Shepherdsons, you know.</t3002> <t3003>That's what people are saying.</t3003> <t3004>The family just found out about half an hour ago, maybe less, and they rushed off immediately.</t3004> <t3005>This time it was a real rush, with guns and horses clattering like never before.</t3005> <t3006>The men have gone around notifying all the relatives.</t3006> <t3007>Old man Saul and some of the guys took guns to the riverbank to kill that guy, because it's very likely he took Miss Sophia across the river.</t3007> <t3008>I guess there might be a lot of trouble coming up.</t3008>
<t3009>- Why didn't Buck wake up and call me?</t3009>
<t3010>- I'm sure he did it on purpose.</t3010> <t3011>They don't want you to get involved in this matter.</t3011> <t3012>Buck loaded his gun and said he was going to catch a Shepherdson. There are a lot of them on the other side, I'm sure of it. Do you think he might manage to capture one?</t3012>
<t3013>I ran quickly to the riverbank.</t3013> <t3014>After a while, I heard gunshots all around.</t3014> <t3015>When I reached the wooden shack near the ferry dock, I looked around the trees for a hidden spot to hide, then I climbed up a tree branch out of gun range to observe.</t3015> <t3016>There was a pile of wood stacked nearly two meters high nearby, and I planned to run there to hide behind it, thinking it might be safer.</t3016> <t3017>Four or five horsemen were galloping around the open ground in front of the wooden shack.</t3017> <t3018>They were cursing and shouting, trying to catch two young men hiding behind the pile of wood along the ferry dock.</t3018> <t3019>But they couldn't get to them.</t3019> <t3020>Every time one of the horsemen poked out towards the river, just a bit beyond the pile of wood, someone from the pile would shoot at them.</t3020> <t3021>The two young men were crouching, leaning against the back of the pile of wood, so they could control both the entrance and exit.</t3021>
<t3022>After a while, they stopped running around and shouting.</t3022> <t3023>They headed towards the warehouse.</t3023> <t3024>Immediately, a boy stood up and fired a shot from the pile of wood, hitting one of the group who fell off his horse.</t3024> <t3025>They quickly jumped off their horses to pick up the injured person and take him back to the warehouse, just as the other two boys started to run away.</t3025> <t3026>The two boys had run halfway from there to where I was hiding when suddenly the others saw them and immediately mounted their horses to give chase.</t3026> <t3027>They almost caught up, but it was no use; the two boys ran very fast and quickly slipped into the pile of wood right in front of the tree where I was hiding.</t3027> <t3028>That gave them an advantage over the others.</t3028> <t3029>One of the two boys was Buck, while the other was a skinny boy about nineteen years old.</t3029>
<t3030>Those people rummaged around for a while and then left.</t3030> <t3031>As soon as they were out of sight, I called out to Buck. At first, he came out.</t3031> <t3032>He was surprised and scared.</t3032> <t3033>Then he told me to keep a close watch and let him know if those people came back.</t3033> <t3034>He said those people had some sort of scheme and would definitely come back.</t3034> <t3035>I wanted to leave this tree, but I didn't dare to.</t3035> <t3036>Suddenly, Buck burst into tears and said that he and his cousin Joe (the one who ran with him) would have to keep hiding all day.</t3036> <t3037>He said his father and two brothers were all killed, and that two or three people on the enemy's side were also killed.</t3037> <t3038>He said the Shepherdsons had set up an ambush.</t3038> <t3039>He said his father and two brothers fought while waiting for their relatives to arrive, but the Shepherdsons were too strong.</t3039> <t3040>I asked what had happened to Harney and Miss Sophia.</t3040> <t3041>He said the two had crossed the river to the other side and were safe.</t3041> <t3042>I was very happy to hear that.</t3042> <t3043>But Buck wasn't; he was very upset thinking about how he couldn't kill Harney the other day in the forest.</t3043> <t3044>I had never seen anything like that before.</t3044>
<t3045>Bang! Bang! Bang! Three or four gunshots rang out.</t3045> <t3046>Both of them abandoned their horses and ran through the forest, sneaking up behind from who knows when.</t3046> <t3047>Both of them ran out and jumped into the river.</t3047> <t3048>Both of them were injured.</t3048> <t3049>And while the two of them swam downstream, the others ran to the riverbank and shot at them, shouting "Kill them, kill them."</t3049> <t3050>I was so pained by what I heard that I almost fell from the tree.</t3050> <t3051>I dare not recount what happened afterward because it is too heartbreaking to speak of.</t3051> <t3052>I think it would have been better if I hadn't gone to the riverbank that night to avoid witnessing those scenes.</t3052> <t3053>Later, I could never forget it; many times, I would dream about them in my sleep.</t3053>
<t3054>I stayed up in the treetop until dusk, too scared to climb down.</t3054> <t3055>Occasionally, I still heard gunshots in the distant forest, and twice I clearly saw groups of armed horsemen passing by the wooden hut, and I guessed that the trouble was still ongoing.</t3055> <t3056>I was so terrified that I resolved never to return to that house again, and I thought that I wouldn't be blamed anyway.</t3056> <t3057>I guessed that the piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was meeting Harney somewhere at half-past two to elope.</t3057> <t3058>I felt that I should have told her father about that piece of paper and her somewhat strange behavior, so he could have locked her up, and then these horrible murders wouldn't have happened.</t3058>
<t3059>After climbing down from the tree, I crawled along the riverbank for a while and saw two bodies lying on the water's edge.</t3059> <t3060>I mustered all my strength to pull the two bodies further inland and turned them over to see their faces, then I ran away as fast as I could.</t3060> <t3061>When I saw Buck's face, I cried for a long time because he was so kind to me.</t3061>
<t3062>Then the sky turned completely dark.</t3062> <t3063>I didn't dare go near the house, but went through the forest to find the swamp.</t3063> <t3064>Jim was no longer there.</t3064> <t3065>I hurriedly weaved through the willow trees, eager to jump on the boat and escape this terrifying place.</t3065> <t3066>The raft was gone too.</t3066> <t3067>Oh my God, I was so scared! For more than a minute, I was breathless. Then I let out a scream.</t3067> <t3068>Just a few meters from where I stood, a voice suddenly spoke:</t3068>
<t3069>- Thank goodness, oh my, is that you?</t3069> <t3070>Keep it down</t3070>
<t3071>That was Jim's voice. I had never heard a voice that made me feel so reassured.</t3071> <t3072>I jumped over the water's edge and onto the raft.</t3072> <t3073>Jim hugged me tightly.</t3073> <t3074>Seeing how happy I was, Jim said:</t3074>
<t3075>- Lucky, buddy, I was down here thinking you were dead again.</t3075> <t3076>Jack came here and said maybe you got shot or something since you didn't return home.</t3076> <t3077>I was planning to push the raft down there to carry it, and if Jack came back and confirmed you were dead, I would leave immediately.</t3077> <t3078>So now that you're back, I'm so happy.</t3078>
<t3079>I said:</t3079>
<t3080>- Great, then that's even better.</t3080> <t3081>That way, they won't look for me anymore because they think I've been killed and my body has floated down the river.</t3081> <t3082>There's a corpse up there, which might make them think that way.</t3082> <t3083>Let's go quickly, Jim, push us out to the middle of the river.</t3083>
<t3084>Until our raft had gone upstream for a few miles downstream and reached the middle of the Mississippi River, we were not at ease.</t3084> <t3085>Then we hung up the signal light, thinking that once again we had escaped danger and were free.</t3085> <t3086>Since yesterday, I hadn't had anything to eat.</t3086> <t3087>Jim took out some fried bread; milk cakes, and there was even meat and green vegetables.</t3087> <t3088>There is nothing more delicious in the world than eating something hot like this.</t3088> <t3089>I ate and chatted with Jim very happily.</t3089> <t3090>I was glad to have escaped the plantation; and Jim was also glad to have escaped the swamp.</t3090> <t3091>We told each other that ultimately, nowhere was better than our raft.</t3091> <t3092>Other places are cramped and suffocating. But on the raft, it's not like that. On the raft, you feel completely free, comfortable, and secure.</t3092>
<t3093>Chapter XIX</t3093>
<t3094>A few more days and nights passed; I think it can be said that I passed those nights, gliding through them, in a peaceful, gentle, and poetic manner.</t3094><t3095>Here, we passed those days and hours like this.</t3095><t3096>The river was both large and wide - in some places up to a mile, a mile and a half.</t3096><t3097>We traveled day and night looking for a secluded spot to sleep.</t3097><t3098>Near the end of the night, we would stop rowing, find a calm spot near a creek to tie the raft, then cut some wildflower branches or willow branches to cover the raft, and cast the fishing line.</t3098><t3099>Then we would jump into the river to bathe, refreshing and invigorating ourselves.</t3099><t3100>Then we would sit and wait on some sandy bank with water up to our knees, waiting for the daylight to come.</t3100><t3101>All around, there was not a sound, complete tranquility, as if the entire world was asleep.</t3101><t3102>Occasionally, we might hear the croaking of frogs. The first thing seen on the other side of the water was just a long, silent row of trees, nothing else could be seen.</t3102><t3103>Then a faint light appeared in the sky, gradually spreading, making the river seem even wider; it was no longer black but grayish.</t3103><t3104>In the distance, we could see black dots floating downstream, drifting endlessly, perhaps sailboats or something, long black objects from the rafts.</t3104><t3105>Sometimes we could hear the splash of oars or the murmur of voices.</t3105><t3106>It was so quiet that the sounds echoed far away.</t3106><t3107>Occasionally, we would see a streak on the water; looking closely, we could recognize it as a tree uprooted and drifting, appearing like that, then mist would roll into coils on the water.</t3107><t3108>In the east, the sky began to redden, then the river, and perhaps the wooden hut on the edge of the forest across the river, maybe a wooden basket of some sort, if suspected of containing something, a dog could be sent in to sniff around.</t3108><t3109>Then a cool breeze would blow, feeling refreshing, gentle, with a fragrant scent of wood and forest flowers.</t3109><t3110>But sometimes, instead, there would be the smell of dead fish around, rising up, pungent and strong.</t3110><t3111>After that, it would be fully daylight.</t3111><t3112>Everything seemed to smile under the sun, and the birds chirped merrily.</t3112>
<t3113>At this moment, even if a little smoke rises, no one can see it.</t3113> <t3114>We lifted a few fish at the end of the line to make a hot meal.</t3114> <t3115>Then we sat back down to watch the deserted river.</t3115> <t3116>People started to get tired, and we lay down to sleep.</t3116> <t3117>From time to time, we woke up and looked outside to see if there was anything.</t3117> <t3118>Perhaps it was a boat laboriously climbing upstream on the far side of the river; from a distance, it was impossible to tell if it was a stern-wheeler or had paddle wheels on both sides.</t3118> <t3119>Then another hour passed, with nothing to see or hear, just silence.</t3119>
<t3120>Later, a raft drifted by on the outer edge.</t3120> <t3121>Perhaps there was a guy on the raft chopping wood, because they often chop wood right on the raft.</t3121> <t3122>From inside here, they could see the glint of the axe being raised, and just as the axe was lifted above his head, there was a thud, a sound that took a moment to travel over the water before reaching our ears.</t3122> <t3123>Then we lay back down, listening to the quiet return.</t3123> <t3124>Once, in thick fog, boats and rafts had to clang pots and pans to avoid being hit by steamships.</t3124> <t3125>A ferry or raft or something passed by us, so close that we could clearly hear them talking, swearing, and laughing loudly, even though we couldn't see anything, as if we were blindfolded; it really felt like ghostly voices drifting through the air.</t3125> <t3126>Jim said maybe they really were ghosts.</t3126> <t3127>I said:</t3127>
<t3128>- No, if it were, it would have said: the fog has lifted.</t3128>
<t3129>Then it wouldn't be long before night came again, and we would set off once more.</t3129> <t3130>Once the raft reached the middle of the river, we let it drift, letting the current take us wherever it wanted.</t3130> <t3131>We lit our cigarettes, dangled our feet in the water, and talked about all sorts of things.</t3131> <t3132>All day and all night, we went shirtless, not caring about the mosquitoes.</t3132> <t3133>The outfit that Mrs. Buck's family made for me was so nice that it became inconvenient to wear.</t3133> <t3134>Besides, I didn't pay much attention to clothes anyway.</t3134>
<t3135>Sometimes it feels like this whole river belongs to us.</t3135> <t3136>Looking across the water, far away on the other side is the riverbank, and the island, and perhaps there is a light, a candle flame in the window frame.</t3136> <t3137>Sometimes there are also a few lights on the water's surface.</t3137> <t3138>Those are the lights on the rafts or ferries, and perhaps we can even hear the sound of a violin or singing echoing out.</t3138> <t3139>Living on a raft or a float, how interesting it is.</t3139> <t3140>Above us, there is only the high sky, dotted with stars, and we often lie on our backs looking up at the sky, debating with each other about who made those stars, and I just say they exist on their own.</t3140> <t3141>I said if someone made that many stars, it would surely take a lot of time.</t3141> <t3142>Jim said the moon gave birth to those stars. Well, it makes sense, so I couldn't say anything to refute that theory.</t3142> <t3143>And since I've seen frogs lay a lot of eggs, it could be that the moon gave birth to those stars.</t3143> <t3144>We also often look at shooting stars, watching their trails stretch down to the horizon.</t3144> <t3145>Jim said those are the bad stars, flying away from their nest.</t3145>
<t3146>A few times during the dark hours, we would encounter passing ships, occasionally they would emit a whole sky full of sparks from their chimneys, and then those sparks would fall like rain onto the river, looking incredibly beautiful.</t3146> <t3147>Then it would turn to another direction, its twinkling lights gradually fading, its chugging sounds also quieting down, and the river would return to silence.</t3147> <t3148>A moment later, when the ship had gone far away, its waves would reach us, causing the raft to bob slightly; then we wouldn't hear anything anymore, and it was impossible to tell how long it had been.</t3148> <t3149>Perhaps only a few sounds of frogs or something else remained.</t3149>
<t3150>Past midnight, the people on both sides of the river were all asleep, and the riverbanks were pitch dark for several hours.</t3150> <t3151>There was no longer any light in the windows.</t3151> <t3152>Those lights were our clocks.</t3152> <t3153>When the first light appeared, it signaled that dawn was approaching, so we would find a place to hide and immediately tie up the raft.</t3153>
<t3154>One morning, just as the sun was rising, I found a boat, rowed through a swift current to reach the main shore, only a few hundred yards away.</t3154> <t3155>Then I rowed about half a mile further to a spot with bushes near a pine forest to see if I could find any berries.</t3155> <t3156>As I reached a narrow path just wide enough for cattle to pass through, suddenly two people came running out from that small path.</t3156> <t3157>I thought to myself, this is trouble, because if anyone is looking for someone here, it could only be me or Jim.</t3157> <t3158>I was about to slip away when those people ran up close, calling me and begging me to save them.</t3158> <t3159>They said they hadn't done anything wrong, yet people were chasing them.</t3159> <t3160>Then they said that people with dogs were about to catch up to them.</t3160> <t3161>They wanted to jump right into my boat, but I said:</t3161>
<t3162>- Don't do that, it's just starting.</t3162> <t3163>I didn't hear any horse sounds.</t3163> <t3164>You have enough time to crawl through that bush, follow the small path down to the water, then wade around here before getting into the boat. That way, the dogs won't be able to track you.</t3164>
<t3165>They followed; as soon as they stepped onto the boat, I rowed quickly back to where we hid the raft.</t3165> <t3166>About fifty minutes later, we heard the sound of dogs and people shouting and yelling.</t3166> <t3167>We heard that they had reached the bushes, but we couldn't see them.</t3167> <t3168>It seemed like they stopped there and searched around for a while.</t3168> <t3169>We went farther away and couldn't hear anything anymore.</t3169> <t3170>After traveling a distance of nearly a mile through the forest and reaching the big river, everything was quiet.</t3170> <t3171>We turned into a creek and hid in the cotton fields; and thus, we felt completely at ease.</t3171>
<t3172>An elderly man of about seventy years or more, bald with graying sideburns.</t3172> <t3173>He wore an old wide-brimmed hat, a grayish-blue undershirt, and old, torn blue pants with the cuffs tucked into his boots.</t3173> <t3174>Over his arm, he carried a blue coat with shiny brass buttons.</t3174> <t3175>Both men carried large, heavy, and dirty bags.</t3175>
<t3176>The other person was about thirty years old, dressed modestly.</t3176>
<t3177>After finishing breakfast, we lay down to rest, chatted, and the first thing that dawned on us was that the two other people didn't know each other at all.</t3177>
<t3178>The bald old man told the other guy:</t3178>
<t3179>- What happened that you have to run away?</t3179>
<t3180>- I sell a product used to remove black stains on teeth, but it doesn't remove the stains and instead removes the enamel.</t3180> <t3181>I stayed an extra night and was planning to sneak away when I met him running towards me on the road. He told me they were coming and asked me to help him escape.</t3181> <t3182>I told him that I was also about to get into trouble, so we ran together.</t3182> <t3183>That's all there is to it, so what's your story?</t3183>
<t3184>- Me? I'm doing an advertisement stunt to quit drinking.</t3184> <t3185>It's been a week, and everyone likes it, especially the women.</t3185> <t3186>This stunt is also making money.</t3186> <t3187>Look, each person pays a dime to watch, children and black people are free, and each night I make five to six dollars.</t3187> <t3188>This stunt was on the rise, but suddenly last night someone went around saying I was just a fraud and that I was secretly selling alcohol.</t3188> <t3189>This morning, a black man came to wake me up and said people were quietly gathering, bringing dogs and horses to catch me for punishment, and they might beat me up badly, or they might tar and feather me, shave all my hair and beard, and drag me on the railroad tracks, who knows.</t3189> <t3190>I didn't even have time for breakfast, and I wasn't hungry either.</t3190>
<t3191>The other person said:</t3191>
<t3192>- My old friend, I think maybe the two of us could do business together, what do you think?</t3192>
<t3193>- For me, it's easy.</t3193> <t3194>But what is your main occupation?</t3194>
<t3195>- Printing newspapers.</t3195> <t3196>That's my main profession.</t3196> <t3197>Occasionally, I make some medicines.</t3197> <t3198>A stage actor specializing in tragedy, you know.</t3198> <t3199>Sometimes, when convenient, I switch to hypnosis or treating mental illnesses.</t3199> <t3200>And if I change professions again, I teach singing, geography; sometimes I give a few lectures.</t3200> <t3201>Oh, I do many things.</t3201> <t3202>Whatever comes my way, I do it, so I don't stick to anything for long.</t3202> <t3203>So, what do you do for a living?</t3203>
<t3204>- In my life, I have been a doctor quite a few times.</t3204> <t3205>The main thing is to live by these two hands.</t3205> <t3206>Treating cancer, paralysis, and similar conditions.</t3206> <t3207>But when someone discovers the truth, it's hard to make a living.</t3207> <t3208>Otherwise, I go preaching, attending evangelical camps.</t3208>
<t3209>After a while, no one spoke anymore.</t3209> <t3210>Then the younger person sighed and said:</t3210>
<t3211>- Oh my God!</t3211>
<t3212>The bald old man asked:</t3212>
<t3213>- What the heck?</t3213>
<t3214>- I think that I have to keep living this kind of life forever, and then gradually lose my dignity among my fellow human beings like this?</t3214> <t3215>After speaking, she raised the handkerchief to dab at the corners of her eyes.</t3215>
<t3216>The old man asked again with a tone that seemed authoritative:</t3216>
<t3217>- It's tough, poor thing, but are the people traveling with you nice?</t3217>
<t3218>- Yes, they treat me quite well.</t3218> <t3219>I can tolerate it.</t3219> <t3220>Moreover, who dares to belittle me while I am like this.</t3220> <t3221>Only I can belittle myself.</t3221> <t3222>I do not avoid you people, I do not avoid anyone.</t3222> <t3223>I endure everything.</t3223> <t3224>No matter where this cold life leads to the most painful place, let it lead.</t3224> <t3225>But one thing I know for sure is that there will be a grave waiting for me somewhere.</t3225> <t3226>Let life go on as it has always gone on, and take everything from me - loved ones, property, everything.</t3226> <t3227>But how can it take away that grave.</t3227> <t3228>One day, I will close my eyes and forget everything, and my broken, suffering heart will rest.</t3228>
<t3229>He said that and then wiped his tears again.</t3229>
<t3230>The bald old man said:</t3230>
<t3231>- Why are you dragging your broken, suffering heart to us? What have we done to you?</t3231>
<t3232>- I know you people won't do anything to me.</t3232> <t3233>I don't avoid you, it's just that I bring myself down, so I have to endure everything, I don't dare to complain at all.</t3233>
<t3234>- Where did you lower yourself? Where exactly?</t3234>
<t3235>- Even if I say it, no one will believe me.</t3235> <t3236>But never mind, it doesn't matter.</t3236> <t3237>The secret of my life.</t3237>
<t3238>- Your secret life?</t3238> <t3239>Are you trying to say that...</t3239>
<t3240>- Gentlemen - he said solemnly - I will reveal to you, because I see that I can trust you.</t3240> <t3241>I myself am a Duke.</t3241>
<t3242>Hearing that, Jim's eyes widened, and it seemed mine did too.</t3242> <t3243>Then the bald old man said:</t3243>
<t3244>- Nonsense, how could that be.</t3244>
<t3245>- Yes, my grandfather's father was the eldest son of the Duke of Bilgewater; he fled to this land around the end of the last century to breathe the fresh air of freedom; then he married there, and died, leaving behind a son.</t3245> <t3246>The Duke of Bilgewater also passed away around that time.</t3246> <t3247>The second son of the duke inherited the title along with all the property, but my grandfather's father, who was the rightful duke, was abandoned.</t3247> <t3248>Thus, I should have been the Duke of Bilgewater.</t3248> <t3249>Yet here I am now, in such a pitiful state.</t3249> <t3250>I am shunned, treated with cold contempt; my life is tattered, wandering, painful, and reduced to the lowest state, having to associate with the wretched on every raft.</t3250>
<t3251>Jim felt very sorry for him after hearing that.</t3251> <t3252>So did I.</t3252> <t3253>We intended to find a way to comfort him, but he said comforting was useless; no one could comfort him anymore.</t3253> <t3254>He said that if we wanted to acknowledge him as he was, it would be better than anything else.</t3254> <t3255>We said: fine, we would acknowledge him, but he had to tell us how.</t3255> <t3256>He said that whenever we talked to him, we had to bow and say "Your Grace," "Your Lordship," and so on... and if we called him by the name Bilgewater, it was okay too, saying that name was just a title, not a name; and he also said that one of us had to stand by when he ate and drank; and had to do all the little tasks he ordered.</t3256>
<t3257>All those measurements weren't difficult, so we obediently followed along.</t3257> <t3258>Throughout the entire lunch, Jim stood around serving him and said, "Does the Duke need this, need that?" and so on...</t3258> <t3259>The Duke seemed very pleased.</t3259>
<t3260>But the old man remained silent and said nothing.</t3260> <t3261>He seemed very annoyed with the demeanor of that duke.</t3261> <t3262>It seemed like he was thinking about something.</t3262> <t3263>By the end of the afternoon, he said:</t3263>
<t3264>- Hey, Bilgewater, I really sympathize with you.</t3264> <t3265>But you're not the only one facing such difficulties.</t3265>
<t3266>- Not so?</t3266>
<t3267>- That's right.</t3267> <t3268>You are not the only one who has been blatantly brought down like that!</t3268>
<t3269>- Heavens!</t3269>
<t3270>- No, you are not the only one who keeps secrets about your life.</t3270> <t3271>Upon saying that, I began to cry uncontrollably.</t3271>
<t3272>- Wait a minute, what are you trying to say?</t3272>
<t3273>- Bilgewater, can I trust you? - He asked, his voice still trembling.</t3273>
<t3274>- I swear to live with it in my heart, and take it to my grave - That man held the old man's hand tightly, then continued - Tell me, what is the secret of your life?</t3274>
<t3275>- Bilgewater, I am the crown prince.</t3275>
<t3276>This time, both Jim and I stared wide-eyed at the old man.</t3276> <t3277>The duke asked:</t3277>
<t3278>- What did you say?</t3278>
<t3279>- Yes, my friend, what I just said is true.</t3279> <t3280>At this moment, in your eyes is the poor prince, Louis the Seventeenth, and here are Louis the Sixteenth and Marie Antoinette.</t3280>
<t3281>- Is that you? Are you really this old?</t3281> <t3282>If you were the last Charlemagne, you would be six hundred years old by now.</t3282>
<t3283>- Because hardships have turned me into such a wretched person, Bilgewater.</t3283> <t3284>Hardships have made my hair turn completely white and ask like this.</t3284> <t3285>Before your eyes, this person in filthy blue clothes, who has been wandering, tormented, trampled upon, and in pain, is the King of France.</t3285>
<t3286>After speaking, the old man kept crying, making Jim and me not know what to do.</t3286> <t3287>We often felt sorry for him and proud too because he came here with us.</t3287> <t3288>So we went to comfort him, as we had comforted the duke before.</t3288> <t3289>But he said that comforting was useless, only death could relieve him of all his sorrows.</t3289> <t3290>But he also felt better when we treated him in certain ways, like kneeling on one knee when speaking to him, always addressing him as "Your Majesty," standing by his side when he ate and drank, and not sitting in his presence unless he permitted it.</t3290> <t3291>So Jim and I had to address him as "Your Majesty," do various things for him, and stand until he allowed us to sit.</t3291> <t3292>That made him very pleased, showing great joy and amusement.</t3292> <t3293>But the duke felt uncomfortable about this.</t3293> <t3294>Nevertheless, the King still showed great intimacy with the duke.</t3294> <t3295>He said that all the dukes of Bilgewater were remembered by his father and were always invited to the palace.</t3295> <t3296>But the duke seemed annoyed.</t3296> <t3297>A moment later, the King spoke again:</t3297>
<t3298>- We won't be on this wooden raft together for much longer, Bilgewater, so why are you sad?</t3298> <t3299>I was not born a duke, it's not my fault.</t3299> <t3300>You were not born a king, it's not your fault either.</t3300> <t3301>So why worry about it?</t3301> <t3302>Accepting and making the best of our circumstances is what we should do.</t3302> <t3303>Moreover, life here isn't too uncomfortable, food and drink are still plentiful.</t3303> <t3304>Come on, let's shake hands, duke, we are friends after all.</t3304>
<t3305>The Duke reached out his hand to shake.</t3305> <t3306>Jim and I were glad to see that.</t3306> <t3307>The heavy atmosphere suddenly dissipated, and we felt happy as well.</t3307> <t3308>On a raft, everyone must be cheerful and harmonious with each other for life to be bearable for a few moments.</t3308> <t3309>Before long, I realized that these two guys were not kings or dukes at all but just swindlers and thieves.</t3309> <t3310>But I didn't say a word or show any attitude.</t3310> <t3311>That was the best way to avoid troublesome arguments.</t3311> <t3312>If they wanted to be called kings or dukes, I would call them that as long as it kept the peace.</t3312> <t3313>I didn't tell Jim either because it wouldn't do any good.</t3313> <t3314>If I hadn't learned anything else from my father, I learned one thing here: just live with people like this and let them do whatever they want.</t3314>
<t3315>Chapter XX</t3315>
<t3316>They asked me a lot of questions: Why did we cover the raft like that? Why did we rest during the day and travel at night?</t3316> <t3317>Is Jim the black man who is running away?</t3317>
<t3318>I said:</t3318>
<t3319>- Oh my God, when has there ever been a black man running away to the South?</t3319>
<t3320>They said that wasn't true.</t3320> <t3321>I immediately replied:</t3321>
<t3322>- My family is in Pike, Missouri.</t3322> <t3323>My whole family is dead, only my father, my younger brother Ike, and I are left. My father left home to stay with my uncle Ben. My uncle has a motorboat that ferries passengers across the river, down below, forty-four miles from Orleans.</t3323> <t3324>My father is very poor and in debt.</t3324> <t3325>So when my father left, he didn't leave anything behind except sixteen dollars and a black man named Jim. With that little money, we couldn't make the journey by steamboat or any other means.</t3325> <t3326>Then the flood came, and my father luckily got a raft, and we decided to go to Orleans.</t3326> <t3327>But unfortunately, one night a steamboat hit one side of the raft.</t3327> <t3328>We jumped into the river, diving deep to avoid the paddle wheel; Jim and I escaped unharmed.</t3328> <t3329>But my father, who was drunk at the time, and my four-year-old brother Ike did not resurface.</t3329> <t3330>A few days later, we faced many difficulties because there were people on boats in the middle of the river trying to catch Jim, claiming he was a runaway black man.</t3330> <t3331>So now we don't travel during the day anymore, but at night to avoid trouble.</t3331>
<t3332>The Duke said:</t3332>
<t3333>- Let me think if there's a way to travel during the day.</t3333> <t3334>I'll think about it first. I'll come up with a trick that might solve this.</t3334> <t3335>For today, let's not rush into it, because obviously, we shouldn't pass through that town during the day, in case something bad happens.</t3335>
<t3336>At night, the sky began to darken and it looked like it was about to rain.</t3336> <t3337>Lightning flashed at the horizon.</t3337> <t3338>The Duke and the King came into our tent to see how the sleeping arrangements were.</t3338> <t3339>My bed was a straw mat, but it was much more comfortable than Jim's, which was a nest made of corn stalks. The corn stalks were stiff, and every time he turned, the dry leaves rustled, waking him up.</t3339> <t3340>The Duke demanded to sleep on my bed, but the King refused.</t3340> <t3341>He said:</t3341>
<t3342>- You should know that in terms of rank and position, I am no more suited to a bed made of corn stalks than you are.</t3342> <t3343>Therefore, you should know your place and understand that lying on that bed is the most appropriate...</t3343>
<t3344>Jim and I were sweating with fear that the two of them would cause trouble again.</t3344> <t3345>But fortunately, the duke said:</t3345>
<t3346>- My fate is unlucky wherever I go.</t3346> <t3347>The suffering and pain that I have endured up to now have made me lose all my spirit. I surrender.</t3347> <t3348>That's just how my fate is.</t3348> <t3349>In this world, only I am lonely...</t3349> <t3350>Please let me suffer, I can endure it.</t3350>
<t3351>We set off when it was completely dark.</t3351> <t3352>The king ordered us to push the raft to the middle of the river and only light the lamps once we were far enough from the city.</t3352> <t3353>A while later, we saw clusters of flickering lights by the river.</t3353> <t3354>That was the town.</t3354> <t3355>The raft smoothly glided past about half a mile.</t3355> <t3356>After nearly a mile, we hung up the lamps.</t3356> <t3357>Around ten o'clock at night, it started pouring rain, the wind howled intermittently, and thunder rumbled.</t3357> <t3358>The king told the two of us to take turns keeping watch carefully until the weather cleared up completely.</t3358> <t3359>Meanwhile, he and the duke crawled into the tent to sleep.</t3359> <t3360>I had to keep watch until midnight.</t3360> <t3361>But even if I were in bed, I probably wouldn't be able to close my eyes.</t3361> <t3362>In fact, it hadn't rained and stormed like this all week.</t3362> <t3363>The wind howled intermittently, chillingly.</t3363> <t3364>Occasionally, a streak of lightning illuminated the white-tipped land mounds stretching about half a mile.</t3364> <t3365>But the island, seen through the rain, looked as if it were covered in a veil of dust.</t3365> <t3366>The trees seemed to be whirling in the wind.</t3366> <t3367>The sound of crackling and rumbling arose, then gradually spread out into the distance.</t3367> <t3368>Waves splashed strongly, soaking me completely on the raft.</t3368> <t3369>But since I wasn't wearing any clothes, I wasn't afraid of getting wet.</t3369> <t3370>Luckily, thanks to the flashes of lightning, we could see the submerged rocks from afar and avoided hitting them.</t3370>
<t3371>I stood guard halfway through but got too sleepy, Jim said he would guard for me.</t3371> <t3372>Jim is always very good to me.</t3372> <t3373>I crawled into the tent, but the king and the duke were sprawled all over, leaving no room for me.</t3373> <t3374>I had to sleep outside the tent, despite the howling wind and rain.</t3374> <t3375>Around two o'clock, the waves became more violent.</t3375> <t3376>Jim intended to call me but decided not to because he thought the waves weren't too dangerous yet.</t3376> <t3377>But he was wrong, right after that, a big wave surged over my head.</t3377> <t3378>Jim looked at me and laughed heartily.</t3378> <t3379>The waves kept crashing and splashing all over me.</t3379> <t3380>Jim laughed so hard he almost burst.</t3380> <t3381>He was a black man who laughed easily, something I rarely encountered.</t3381>
<t3382>I went out to stand guard in place of Jim. He had just laid down and was already snoring.</t3382> <t3383>Gradually, the storm subsided.</t3383> <t3384>At the first light of dawn, I woke Jim up and then steered the raft into hiding.</t3384>
<t3385>After finishing breakfast, the king took out an old deck of cards and played cards for money with the duke, each game worth five xu.</t3385> <t3386>After they got bored of playing, they discussed launching a new campaign.</t3386> <t3387>The duke rummaged through his pocket, took out a stack of pre-printed papers, and read aloud.</t3387> <t3388>One paper read: “The renowned doctor of Paris, Armand de Montanbal, will give a lecture on the treatment of neurological diseases on ... day...”</t3388> <t3389>The entrance fee is one hào, and reference charts on the nature of the disease will be provided, each chart costing twenty-five xu.”</t3389> <t3390>The duke said that he himself was that doctor.</t3390> <t3391>Another paper stated that he was Garrick Younger Iung, from Drury Lane, London, a famous artist known worldwide for performing Shakespearean tragedies.</t3391> <t3392>In other papers, he had different names and did various strange jobs, such as having a magic wand to find water, find gold, and to dispel witchcraft spells, etc.</t3392> <t3393>Then, he said:</t3393>
<t3394>- But the most captivating is still the art of theater.</t3394> <t3395>Have you ever been on stage?</t3395>
<t3396>- Not yet - The king replied.</t3396>
<t3397>The Duke said:</t3397>
<t3398>- So, in just a few days, you will have the chance to get on stage.</t3398> <t3399>When we reach a nearby big town, I will rent a theater and perform a sword-swallowing act in the play: "King Richard and Juliet".</t3399> <t3400>What do you think?</t3400>
<t3401>- Bilgewater, I'm willing to do anything as long as there's money.</t3401> <t3402>But I've never acted before, and I haven't seen much either.</t3402> <t3403>When I was little, my father used to take me to see plays, but I was too young then.</t3403> <t3404>Can you teach me?</t3404>
<t3405>- It's no big deal!</t3405>
<t3406>- That works.</t3406> <t3407>Anyway, I am looking for something a bit new.</t3407> <t3408>Let's start the day.</t3408>
<t3409>Then the duke explained who Romeo was, who Juliet was, and said that he would play the role of Romeo, while the king would now play the role of Juliet.</t3409>
<t3410>- But, Duke, Juliet is such a beautiful girl, I'm afraid my bald head is not quite suitable.</t3410>
<t3411>- Don't worry.</t3411> <t3412>The villagers here will never think of that.</t3412> <t3413>Besides, when you put on the costume, you look completely different. Juliet stood on the balcony, gazing at the moon before going back inside to sleep, and she had put on her nightgown, with a cloak and a cap embroidered with her name to make it easier to escape.</t3413> <t3414>But here are the costumes for that play.</t3414>
<t3415>He pulled out two or three sets of coarse cloth clothes from the bag, claiming that they were medieval battle costumes of Richard III and his opponent.</t3415> <t3416>Then there was a long white nightshirt with an outer coat for fighting.</t3416> <t3417>The king was very pleased.</t3417> <t3418>After that, the duke took out his book and read passages about the aforementioned events, gesturing and moving his feet to accurately portray the required actions.</t3418> <t3419>Then he handed the book to the king, telling him to memorize his parts.</t3419>
<t3420>About three miles from where we were, there was a small town.</t3420> <t3421>After lunch, the duke said he had found a trick to travel during the day without any danger to Jim. He said he would go into town to take care of this matter.</t3421> <t3422>The king said he would go along to lend a hand.</t3422> <t3423>We were out of coffee, so Jim suggested I might as well take the boat with them to buy some.</t3423>
<t3424>When we arrived in the town, the streets were completely deserted, not a single person in sight, and everything was as silent as a Sunday.</t3424> <t3425>We encountered a black man lying in the sun on a yard near the main road.</t3425> <t3426>He said that only those who were too young, too old, or too weak stayed at home; everyone else had gone to the ceremony in the forest.</t3426> <t3427>The king asked for directions and then invited me to go with him.</t3427>
<t3428>The Duke wanted to find a printing house.</t3428> <t3429>We found a small printing workshop located above a carpenter's shop.</t3429> <t3430>Both the carpenter and the printer were at a ceremony, and the door was not locked.</t3430> <t3431>The printing workshop was dirty, messy, full of ink stains, and had drawings of horses and black men riding horses and running away, pasted all around the walls.</t3431> <t3432>The Duke took off his coat, saying that his work was now settled.</t3432> <t3433>The king and I went to the festival.</t3433> <t3434>It took us about half an hour to get there.</t3434> <t3435>Sweat poured out like a bath because it was very hot that day.</t3435> <t3436>Thousands of people from as far as twenty miles away gathered here.</t3436> <t3437>In the forest, there were horses and carriages everywhere, with horses tied up all around.</t3437> <t3438>There were tents made of wooden stakes covered with branches, selling lemons, ginger, large coconuts, leaf cakes, and many other things.</t3438>
<t3439>In other huts that seemed more spacious, people were praying.</t3439> <t3440>Benches made of thin planks with holes to insert sticks for footrests but without backrests.</t3440> <t3441>The pastor preached from higher wooden platforms in the corner of the hut.</t3441> <t3442>Women wore hats and woolen coats, some even carried umbrellas.</t3442> <t3443>Some of the men were barefoot, and the children wore only coarse cloth garments.</t3443> <t3444>The elderly sat knitting while the village boys secretly flirted with the girls.</t3444>
<t3445>In the first tent, a pastor led a hymn.</t3445> <t3446>He sang the first two lines, everyone sang along, and it sounded quite good.</t3446> <t3447>The singing grew more and more enthusiastic.</t3447> <t3448>The crowd seemed to get more excited, singing louder and louder.</t3448> <t3449>By the end of the hymn, they were shouting, some even screaming.</t3449> <t3450>Then the pastor began to preach.</t3450> <t3451>He walked back and forth on the stage, stepping to one side, then the other, moving to the front, his hands and feet never resting.</t3451>
<t3452>After a while, people could no longer hear what the pastor was saying.</t3452> <t3453>The whole crowd rushed to the bench reserved for the penitents.</t3453> <t3454>They cried, screamed, and rolled around in utter chaos.</t3454>
<t3455>Then, the king stepped up.</t3455> <t3456>The pastor invited him to speak to the people.</t3456> <t3457>His voice made everyone fall silent.</t3457> <t3458>He recounted that he had been a pirate on the Indian Ocean for thirty years.</t3458> <t3459>In a battle last spring, many of his comrades were killed.</t3459> <t3460>Now he needed to recruit new people.</t3460> <t3461>But last night, on his way, he was robbed of every penny and thrown onto a ship.</t3461> <t3462>He felt glad about that incident.</t3462> <t3463>He silently vowed that from now on, he would live differently.</t3463> <t3464>He would return to the Indian Ocean to advise the remaining pirates to lead an honest life.</t3464> <t3465>He believed he could do this better than anyone else because he was familiar with every pirate.</t3465> <t3466>And although he had no money left in his pocket and it would take a long time to get back there, he would still go.</t3466> <t3467>And every time he converted a pirate, he would tell them: “Please don’t thank me.</t3467> <t3468>All the gratitude belongs to the people of Pokeville festival, those who have helped humanity, and that pastor, the truest friend you have never had.”</t3468>
<t3469>After speaking, the old man cried loudly.</t3469> <t3470>Seeing this, everyone else also cried.</t3470> <t3471>Then a few people shouted.</t3471>
<t3472>- Let's raise money to help him!</t3472>
<t3473>So, five or six people rushed over, but someone said:</t3473>
<t3474>- Tell him to hold out his hat and we'll put money into it.</t3474>
<t3475>Everyone else said the same, even the pastor. So the king extended his hat, went around the crowd, wiping his tears, blessing them, and thanking everyone for their kindness towards the pirates.</t3475> <t3476>Occasionally, a few beautiful girls, with tears streaming down their faces, would step forward and ask for an old kiss to remember.</t3476> <t3477>He agreed immediately, and some were hugged tightly and kissed five or six times by him.</t3477> <t3478>Then he was invited to stay for a week.</t3478> <t3479>Everyone wanted to invite him to their home, saying it was an honor for them.</t3479> <t3480>But he declined because he was in a hurry to return to the Indian Ocean to persuade his comrades.</t3480>
<t3481>Upon returning to the wooden raft, he counted a total of eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents.</t3481> <t3482>He also swiped two bottles of whiskey that were under the trunk of a car on the edge of the forest.</t3482> <t3483>He said this was the best haul, even better than the days when he had to preach like that pastor.</t3483>
<t3484>The duke thought that he had done something even more interesting than the king.</t3484> <t3485>He had printed some things for a few landowners, like horse purchase papers, and received four dollars.</t3485> <t3486>Then he earned another ten dollars for advertising in a newspaper.</t3486> <t3487>Thus, he made nine and a half dollars and considered that he had done an honest day's work.</t3487>
<t3488>Then he showed us a notice that he had printed for free, because it was for us.</t3488> <t3489>It was a picture of a runaway black man, carrying a stick over his shoulder with a bundle hanging from it, with the caption underneath: "Two hundred dollars reward."</t3489> <t3490>The person in the picture was Jim. The notice also stated that Jim had escaped from the St. Jacque plantation, forty miles below New Orleans, last winter and was apparently heading north. Whoever captured him and brought him back would receive the reward and be reimbursed for other expenses.</t3490>
<t3491>The Duke said:</t3491>
<t3492>- From today, if we want, we can travel during the day.</t3492> <t3493>If we meet anyone, we can tie Jim's hands and feet with a rope, place Jim in that tent, then show this paper and say that we caught him by the river.</t3493> <t3494>Because we don't have enough money for the boat, we have to borrow this wooden raft to go claim the reward.</t3494> <t3495>If we had iron chains to put on Jim, it would be better, but it doesn't fit with the story that we're too poor.</t3495> <t3496>So the rope is more reasonable.</t3496>
<t3497>We all thought that the duke was really wise.</t3497> <t3498>And so, we weren't worried about traveling during the day at all.</t3498> <t3499>We discussed among ourselves that night that we could travel a few more miles to get out of this area and then go wherever we wanted.</t3499> <t3500>We lay down, silently without speaking, until nearly ten o'clock at night without showing ourselves.</t3500> <t3501>Then we quietly left, quite far from the town, and didn't put up any signal lights until we were completely out of sight.</t3501>
<t3502>Jim woke me up to take the watch at four in the morning.</t3502> <t3503>He asked:</t3503>
<t3504>- Huck, do you think we will encounter any other kings on this trip?</t3504>
<t3505>I replied:</t3505>
<t3506>- No.</t3506>
<t3507>- He said:</t3507>
<t3508>- That will do.</t3508> <t3509>Two kings like this are more than enough.</t3509> <t3510>This king is an alcoholic.</t3510> <t3511>And that duke over there is no better.</t3511>
<t3512>There were times when I saw Jim insistently asking the king to speak French so he could try to understand; but the old man said that he had been in this country for so long that he had forgotten everything.</t3512>

<t3515>Chapter XXI</t3515>
<t3516>The sun was already high, but we continued on without stopping to hide the raft as usual.</t3516> <t3517>Occasionally, the king and the duke would step out, looking tired.</t3517> <t3518>But when they jumped into the river to bathe, they immediately became alert.</t3518> <t3519>After breakfast, the king took off his shoes, rolled up his pants, and dipped his feet into the water.</t3519> <t3520>Then he lit a cigarette and sat murmuring to memorize his part in Romeo and Juliet.</t3520> <t3521>Once he had memorized it quite well, he and the duke rehearsed together.</t3521> <t3522>The duke had to instruct him repeatedly, making him practice long verses and place his hand over his heart.</t3522> <t3523>After a while of rehearsing, he praised the king and said:</t3523>
<t3524>- It's just that every time you call out the name Romeo, you howl like a wolf.</t3524> <t3525>You have to say it very gently, like this: Ro-me-o.</t3525> <t3526>There, like that, because Juliet is a gentle girl, so she can't screech like a donkey.</t3526>
<t3527>Then, the two of them took out a pair of wooden swords that the duke had carved, and began to practice fencing.</t3527> <t3528>The duke played the role of King Richard III.</t3528> <t3529>They chased each other on the raft, looking quite frightening.</t3529> <t3530>Suddenly, the king slipped and fell into the water with a splash.</t3530> <t3531>They sat down again, talking to each other about all sorts of adventures they had experienced before.</t3531>
<t3532>After finishing lunch, the duke said to the king:</t3532>
<t3533>- We have to make the performance top-notch, you understand? Therefore, we need to embellish it a bit to make it richer, just in case the audience asks for an encore, saying "encore," so we have something more to perform.</t3533>
<t3534>- What is Encore, Bilgewater?</t3534>
<t3535>The Duke explained to the old man, then said:</t3535>
<t3536>- I will respond to their request with a wild dance from the highlands or from the sailors.</t3536> <t3537>As for you, you can perform Hamlet's monologue.</t3537>
<t3538>- What of Hamlet?</t3538>
<t3539>- Hamlet's soliloquy.</t3539> <t3540>It is the most famous passage of Shakespeare. My God, it is incredibly sacred, always captivating the audience.</t3540> <t3541>I don't have that entire passage in this book, only a single volume.</t3541> <t3542>Let me walk around a bit, see if I can recall it.</t3542>
<t3543>The Duke walked up and down looking very thoughtful, his eyebrows raised high, making him look very fierce.</t3543> <t3544>Then he sighed deeply, a hot tear rolled down his cheek, looking quite ridiculous.</t3544> <t3545>A moment later, he remembered and told us to pay attention.</t3545> <t3546>With a noble gesture, one foot forward, both hands extended in front, head slightly tilted back, he then began to grind his teeth, speaking deliriously and emphasizing certain parts.</t3546> <t3547>I had never seen a performance like that before.</t3547> <t3548>Emphasizing every part, truly, I had never seen such a performance before.</t3548> <t3549>The entire monologue was filled with roaring and then sobbing.</t3549>
<t3550>The king was very fond of this part, so he remembered it immediately after learning it.</t3550> <t3551>It seems like he was born to play this role.</t3551> <t3552>He tried acting it out.</t3552> <t3553>His gestures, whether crying, pouting, or stumbling, looked truly adorable.</t3553>
<t3554>The days spent on the river, the wooden raft had become an unparalleled place of interest, because all day long, we got to watch sword fights and practice drills.</t3554> <t3555>One morning, we arrived at the region of Arcansaw.</t3555> <t3556>It was a small town located on the riverbank.</t3556> <t3557>We tied the raft at a spot nearly a mile away with a pine tree overhanging it, and then all of us except Jim went down to the town to see if there was any place to perform.</t3557>
<t3558>What a stroke of luck. In this place, there is a circus troupe about to perform in the afternoon.</t3558> <t3559>The villagers have already started to gather.</t3559> <t3560>They are bringing along horses and carts.</t3560> <t3561>The circus troupe will leave the town before nightfall, making our performance more likely to succeed.</t3561> <t3562>The Duke asked to rent the tent, and we went to put up advertisements.</t3562> <t3563>The advertisement read as follows:</t3563>

<t3592>We went around the town to put up advertisements.</t3592> <t3593>The houses and shops here are all old and dilapidated.</t3593> <t3594>The doors are cracked, dry, and have not been repainted.</t3594> <t3595>The floors of the houses are all higher than the street level by about a small garden plot, but not much is cultivated, just a few marigold and cockscomb flowers, the rest is cluttered with torn wires, broken glass, trash, and tin cans.</t3595> <t3596>The gate is made of various pieces of wood patched together, looking very shabby, the duke said it was from the time of Columbus or something.</t3596> <t3597>Sometimes, there are even herds of pigs rummaging around in the garden.</t3597>
<t3598>The shops run along the entire street.</t3598> <t3599>In front of each house, there is an awning where customers can tie their horses.</t3599> <t3600>Under those small awnings are wooden platforms, where idle people sit all day, itching to carve the platforms with their knives; chewing tobacco noisily, occasionally yawning out of boredom and wandering from place to place, hands in their pockets, only taking them out to scratch or ask for a cigarette.</t3600> <t3601>The phrase they say the most is:</t3601>
<t3602>- Hans, give me a cigarette!</t3602>
<t3603>- No, I only have one cigarette left.</t3603> <t3604>Ask Bin.</t3604>
<t3605>Maybe Bin will give the guy a cigarette, or maybe he'll say he doesn't have any.</t3605> <t3606>There are guys who don't have a single penny in the world.</t3606> <t3607>Whenever they crave a cigarette, they go asking or borrowing.</t3607> <t3608>They tell one person or another:</t3608>
<t3609>- Jack, can you lend me a handful of medicine?</t3609> <t3610>I just gave my last handful to Bin Thompson.</t3610>
<t3611>But he lied, and only managed to deceive strangers.</t3611> <t3612>But that Jack fellow knew his tricks well, so he said:</t3612>
<t3613>- You gave it to him, didn't you?</t3613> <t3614>First, you should return the doses you borrowed from me, then I'll lend you a few more tons without charging any interest.</t3614>
<t3615>- But I already paid you.</t3615>
<t3616>- Yes, you have paid me a few times, but the stuff you gave me is only for black people to smoke...</t3616>
<t3617>All the streets and alleys were muddy and full of potholes.</t3617> <t3618>Everywhere you looked, there was mud, black as tar, with some places submerged up to three or four inches.</t3618> <t3619>Pigs ran around everywhere, squealing.</t3619> <t3620>A sow with a litter of piglets, covered in mud, swaggered down the middle of the street, forcing people to step aside.</t3620> <t3621>When the piglets gathered to nurse, the sow lay down, half-closing her eyes and flicking her ears, looking as content as a person who just got paid.</t3621> <t3622>Then it heard a shout: “Tiger, kill it!” The pig sprang up and ran, squealing in terror as two dogs each bit one of its ears, and dozens of other dogs came running from who knows where.</t3622> <t3623>All the idle men stood up, ran to watch, laughed loudly, and seemed very pleased.</t3623> <t3624>After that, they returned to their spots, sitting until another dog fight broke out for them to watch.</t3624> <t3625>Nothing made these men more alert and delighted than a dog fight.</t3625> <t3626>If not, they would catch a stray dog, smear it with tree sap, set it on fire, or tie a tin can to its tail and watch it run around in panic until it died.</t3626> <t3627>By the riverbank, several houses stood crooked, leaning as if about to collapse.</t3627> <t3628>The people who lived in these houses had all left.</t3628> <t3629>The riverbank had been eroded by water, making the houses seem like they were hanging in mid-air, and the town kept retreating inward.</t3629>
<t3630>The closer it got to noon, the more crowded the streets became with vehicles, completely filling the streets.</t3630> <t3631>There were families who brought food from the countryside and ate right in their cars.</t3631> <t3632>They drank a lot of whisky.</t3632> <t3633>I personally witnessed three fights.</t3633> <t3634>Suddenly, someone shouted:</t3634>
<t3635>- Old Boggs is coming!</t3635> <t3636>Every month he comes up here to get drunk!</t3636> <t3637>He's here now, guys!</t3637>
<t3638>The entire group of idlers seemed very amused; I guessed they often teased old Boggs.</t3638> <t3639>Everyone said:</t3639>
<t3640>- I wonder who he will settle the score with this time.</t3640> <t3641>If we gather all the people he has dealt with over the past twenty years, he would surely become famous.</t3641>
<t3642>Another person in the group said:</t3642>
<t3643>- I hope Boggs will scare me, because I know I won't die for another thousand years.</t3643>
<t3644>Old Boggs came thundering on horseback, yelling like an Indian, then shouted loudly:</t3644>
<t3645>- Get out of my way or I'll trample you all to death.</t3645> <t3646>If the price of coffins skyrockets, don't blame me.</t3646>
<t3647>The old man was drunk, swaying on the horse's saddle.</t3647> <t3648>He was over fifty, his face flushed red like a fighting cock's.</t3648> <t3649>Everyone who saw him shouted, laughed, and mocked him.</t3649> <t3650>He greeted back and said he would return to meet them, as he still had to go to town to kill Colonel Sherburn, and his motto was: Deal with the biggest first, then the small fry.</t3650>
<t3651>Seeing me, the old man spurred his horse closer and asked:</t3651>
<t3652>- Hey kid, where are you from?</t3652> <t3653>Do you want to die?</t3653>
<t3654>After speaking, the old man left immediately.</t3654> <t3655>I was terrified, but someone said:</t3655>
<t3656>- He doesn't mean anything by it; he's always like that when he's drunk.</t3656> <t3657>But he's the kindest person in Arcansaw.</t3657> <t3658>He never hits anyone, whether drunk or sober.</t3658>
<t3659>Old Boggs rode his horse past the largest shop in town, then stopped, leaned down to look through the curtain on the outer roof, and called inside:</t3659>
<t3660>- Sherburn, come out here.</t3660> <t3661>Come out here and face the one you deceived.</t3661> <t3662>You are the dog I am chasing, and I will catch you.</t3662>
<t3663>Then the old man kept calling Sherburn all sorts of names.</t3663> <t3664>The whole street gathered, crowded, listening and laughing.</t3664> <t3665>A while later, a dignified, well-dressed man stepped out of a shop, and the crowd parted to make way for him.</t3665> <t3666>He spoke to old Boggs, slowly and seemingly very calmly:</t3666>
<t3667>- I'm really tired of this game, I'll endure you for just one more hour.</t3667> <t3668>After one hour, if you still open your mouth to talk about me, no matter how far you go, I will find you.</t3668>
<t3669>Then the man turned back inside.</t3669> <t3670>The crowd around stood still, no one moved, and no one dared to laugh anymore. Old Boggs spurred his horse and rode off, still shouting, calling Sherburn's name loudly.</t3670> <t3671>He rode down the street, then after a while turned back and stopped his horse in front of the store, still shouting.</t3671> <t3672>Some people nearby tried to tell him to stop, but he wouldn't listen.</t3672> <t3673>They said it was only fifteen minutes to one o'clock, and he should go home immediately.</t3673> <t3674>But it was no use.</t3674> <t3675>He yelled even louder, threw his hat into the mud for the horse to trample on, then spurred his horse down to the end of the street, his gray hair flying in the wind.</t3675> <t3676>The whole crowd tried to restrain his horse; they struggled to hold the horse down and keep his mouth shut, but it was in vain.</t3676> <t3677>He galloped back up the street and cursed Sherburn. Suddenly someone said:</t3677>
<t3678>- Find the old man's daughter and bring her here, quickly.</t3678> <t3679>Maybe he will listen to his daughter.</t3679>
<t3680>Someone ran off to find help.</t3680> <t3681>I went down the street and then stopped.</t3681> <t3682>About fifty minutes later, old Boggs was seen running down again, but this time he wasn't on horseback.</t3682> <t3683>He ran across the street to where I was standing, bareheaded, with two friends holding his arms and dragging him along.</t3683> <t3684>He seemed uncomfortable but didn't say anything; not only did he not pull back, but he also seemed to hurry forward.</t3684>
<t3685>There was a voice calling loudly:</t3685>
<t3686>- Boggs!</t3686>
<t3687>I turned around to see who was calling, and it turned out to be Colonel Sherburn from earlier.</t3687> <t3688>He stood still in the middle of the road, holding a gun in his right hand, not aiming; the barrel of the gun was pointing up at the sky.</t3688> <t3689>At the same time, I saw a girl running towards him, and two other people turned around to see who was calling him; when they saw the gun, they quickly jumped to the side, and the barrel of the gun slowly lowered, pointing straight ahead.</t3689> <t3690>Old Boggs raised both hands to the sky and said:</t3690>
<t3691>- Oh! Please don't shoot!</t3691>
<t3692>Bang!</t3692> <t3693>The first shot went off, and old Boggs staggered, his arms flailing.</t3693> <t3694>Bang!</t3694> <t3695>The second shot followed, and he fell to the ground, his arms outstretched.</t3695> <t3696>His daughter barely had time to scream before she rushed over, collapsing beside her father's body, crying:</t3696>
<t3697>- Oh my God, it killed my father, it killed my father!</t3697>
<t3698>The crowd gathered around, people jostling each other, and those inside trying to push the others back:</t3698>
<t3699>- Move back, move back, let the old man have some air to breathe!</t3699>
<t3700>Colonel Sherburn threw the gun to the ground, then turned and walked away.</t3700>
<t3701>They brought old Boggs into a small drugstore.</t3701> <t3702>The crowd still gathered around.</t3702> <t3703>The whole town came along.</t3703> <t3704>I ran up and found a spot by the window near where old Boggs was placed.</t3704> <t3705>They laid him down on the floor and placed a large Bible under his head.</t3705> <t3706>Then they took another Bible, opened it, and placed it on his chest.</t3706> <t3707>Before that, they tore his undershirt open, and I could clearly see the bullet wound.</t3707> <t3708>He gasped more than a dozen times, then after that, he lay still.</t3708> <t3709>He was dead.</t3709>
<t3710>They pulled the daughter outside.</t3710> <t3711>The daughter was still crying, but they took her away.</t3711> <t3712>She was only about sixteen years old, looking very gentle and beautiful, but her face had turned pale with fear.</t3712>
<t3713>The entire town had gathered there, crowding, jostling, and pushing each other to get closer to the window to see old Boggs: but those in the front wouldn't budge, while those in the back kept saying:</t3713>
<t3714>- Hey, you over there, have you seen enough? Why are you still standing here?</t3714> <t3715>Move aside so others can see too...</t3715>
<t3716>They argued fiercely.</t3716> <t3717>I slipped outside, afraid that another troublesome incident might occur.</t3717> <t3718>The streets were crowded with people.</t3718> <t3719>Everyone seemed to be in a hurry.</t3719> <t3720>Those who had witnessed the shooting recounted the whole story, and each time someone told it, a crowd would gather around, eagerly listening.</t3720> <t3721>A tall man with long hair, holding a shepherd's staff, was standing and pointing at the spot where Boggs had stood and where Sherburn had stood earlier.</t3721> <t3722>People followed the man from one spot to another, watching him perform his act, nodding their heads as if they understood, then bending down with their hands on their knees, watching the other man stand up straight, walk to where Sherburn had stood, furrow his brows, pull his hat brim down to his eyes, and shout out.</t3722>
<t3723>- Boggs!</t3723>
<t3724>And now his stick, he said:</t3724>
<t3725>- Bang!</t3725>
<t3726>And he collapsed.</t3726> <t3727>Everyone said that he had reenacted it very accurately and that what had just happened was exactly the same.</t3727> <t3728>Then more than a dozen people took bottles of liquor from their pockets and handed them to him.</t3728>
<t3729>Later, someone said that Sherburn would be judged guilty. Everyone was talking about it, then they all went together, each person shouting like crazy.</t3729> <t3730>They grabbed the strips of cloth to go and hang Sherburn.</t3730>

<t3733>Chapter XXII</t3733>
<t3734>They rushed to Sherburn's house, screaming wildly like Native Americans.</t3734> <t3735>Everything was either pushed aside, pushed forward, or horribly crushed.</t3735> <t3736>Children led the way, shouting for everyone to get out of the way.</t3736> <t3737>Women stuck their heads out through the windows.</t3737> <t3738>Black children climbed up trees.</t3738> <t3739>Other black men and girls looked through the fence.</t3739> <t3740>Wherever the crowd went, the onlookers there scattered or retreated inside.</t3740> <t3741>Many women and girls, seeing this, were terrified and cried out in fear.</t3741>
<t3742>They crowded up to Sherburn's fence, packed tightly.</t3742> <t3743>The area was a yard about six feet wide.</t3743> <t3744>There was a voice saying:</t3744>
<t3745>- Pull down the fence, pull it down!</t3745>
<t3746>Then there was a cracking sound, the fence collapsed, and everyone poured in like a flood.</t3746> <t3747>At that moment, Sherburn stepped out, holding a double-barreled gun, standing upright, very calm and composed, not saying a word.</t3747> <t3748>The noise suddenly ceased, and the crowd stood still.</t3748>
<t3749>Sherburn still said nothing, just stood there looking down.</t3749> <t3750>The silence was eerie.</t3750> <t3751>Sherburn slowly cast his eyes around.</t3751> <t3752>Wherever he looked, people would avert their gaze.</t3752> <t3753>Then suddenly, Sherburn let out a chilling laugh, like biting into a grain of sand while eating.</t3753> <t3754>He spoke, his voice full of contempt:</t3754>
<t3755>- Your family's antics are truly laughable!</t3755> <t3756>You think you have the courage to punish a man?</t3756> <t3757>You think that smearing tar on him and shaving the heads of poor, helpless women makes you heroes?</t3757> <t3758>And then you think you can lay a hand on a man too?</t3758> <t3759>Thousands of you couldn't do anything to a man like me.</t3759> <t3760>You think I don't know what kind of people you are? Well, you're mistaken.</t3760> <t3761>I've traveled from the South to the North, so I know well that people here are very cowardly.</t3761> <t3762>In the North, people let others oppress them, then go home and pray, enduring the humiliation.</t3762> <t3763>While in the South, people brazenly rob in broad daylight.</t3763> <t3764>The newspapers praise you as a brave nation, so you think you're braver than others.</t3764> <t3765>Why don't you dare to punish that murderer?</t3765> <t3766>Because you're afraid his friends will shoot you in the back.</t3766> <t3767>So you ignore it.</t3767> <t3768>At night, someone leads hundreds of cowards, wearing masks, to punish that murderer.</t3768> <t3769>Your mistake is not having a leader and not daring to look into the darkness to see your own masks.</t3769> <t3770>You only bring along someone who isn't even a person - Buck Harness over there - and if it weren't for his instigation, you wouldn't accomplish anything.</t3770>
<t3771>You also don't want to come here because you don't like trouble and danger.</t3771> <t3772>But Buck Harness kept shouting "Kill him! Kill him!" so you didn't dare to retreat, fearing people would know you were cowards.</t3772> <t3773>Then you all came here in a noisy crowd, swearing to do outrageous things.</t3773> <t3774>But the most shameful thing about the chaotic crowd is that they don't fight with the courage within them, but with the borrowed courage of the masses, of the leader.</t3774> <t3775>But even more shameful is that the crowd doesn't have a single decent leader like you do now.</t3775> <t3776>Now, you should go home and lock your doors tightly.</t3776> <t3777>If you want to execute someone, you should choose the darkness like the Southerners do. Now get out of here for my sake.</t3777>
<t3778>Speaking of that, he raised the gun and then loaded it.</t3778> <t3779>The whole crowd suddenly backed away, then gradually dispersed, and then ran in all directions. Even the cowardly Buck Harness ran along with the crowd.</t3779>
<t3780>I went to the circus and sneaked around to the back, waited for the guard to pass by, and then crawled under the tent.</t3780> <t3781>Even though I still had twenty dollars and some other money, I thought it would be better to save it because you never know when you might need it, especially when you're far from home and living among strangers.</t3781> <t3782>I'm not against paying to see the circus, but if I don't have to spend the money, that's even better.</t3782>
<t3783>It was a very respectable circus troupe.</t3783> <t3784>But the men and women riding horses in pairs looked truly spectacular.</t3784> <t3785>The men wore tight shirts and shorts, barefoot, with their hands resting easily and steadily on their thighs.</t3785> <t3786>As for the women, they were very beautiful, looking like queens, dressed in luxurious outfits worth millions of dollars, with diamonds even pinned to their clothes.</t3786> <t3787>I had never seen anything so beautiful.</t3787> <t3788>Each person took turns standing up and gracefully circling the arena.</t3788> <t3789>The men were tall, majestic, and dignified, while the women wore fluttering pink dresses, soft and delicate.</t3789>
<t3790>Each time they went faster, all of them dancing, lifting one leg and then the other.</t3790> <t3791>But the horse tilted its head as the handler walked around, whipping and shouting.</t3791> <t3792>Everyone applauded enthusiastically.</t3792>
<t3793>During the performance, they did many very unusual tricks.</t3793><t3794>When the clown came out, everyone laughed uproariously.</t3794><t3795>I don't understand how he could come up with so many tricks and be so quick.</t3795><t3796>Even if I practiced for a year, I couldn't do that.</t3796><t3797>Suddenly, a drunken man appeared from somewhere and tried to step onto the stage, saying he wanted to ride a horse.</t3797><t3798>He claimed he could ride a horse just as well as the performers earlier.</t3798><t3799>They tried to hold him back, but he wouldn't listen, and the show had to be temporarily halted.</t3799><t3800>The audience booed and cursed at him, making him even more frightened.</t3800><t3801>Some spectators jumped out of their seats and stepped onto the stage, saying, "Beat him up and throw him out!" A few women screamed in fear.</t3801><t3802>Then the circus owner said that if the drunken man promised not to cause any more trouble, he would let him ride the horse.</t3802><t3803>Everyone laughed and agreed to let the man step onto the stage.</t3803><t3804>As soon as he sat on the horse, it started bucking wildly all over the place.</t3804><t3805>Two circus members ran out and tried to grab the reins but couldn't, while the drunken man clung tightly to the horse's neck. Each time the horse bucked, he would fly up, legs flailing in the air, making the audience laugh until they cried.</t3805><t3806>Finally, the horse calmed down and slowly walked around the stage; the man still lay on the horse's back, clinging to its neck, with one leg dangling close to the ground, then the other.</t3806><t3807>Everyone laughed uproariously.</t3807><t3808>As for me, I didn't find it amusing at all; instead, I was scared for the man.</t3808><t3809>But then, suddenly, he sat up, grabbed the reins, leaned to one side, then the other, and then jumped up, letting go of the reins and standing straight; the horse began to gallop like the wind.</t3809><t3810>He stood effortlessly on the horse as if he weren't drunk at all.</t3810><t3811>Then, while galloping, he started taking off his outer clothes and throwing them to the ground.</t3811><t3812>He was wearing so many clothes, a total of seventeen layers.</t3812><t3813>He revealed himself to be a handsome and clever young man, then he spurred the horse hard, making it neigh loudly.</t3813><t3814>Finally, he jumped down, bowed to the audience, and ran inside.</t3814><t3815>Everyone cheered loudly in amazement.</t3815>
<t3816>The circus owner pretended to be someone who had just been fooled, but in reality, that guy was actually part of the circus!</t3816> <t3817>He had made up that joke without informing anyone beforehand.</t3817> <t3818>I don't know if there is any circus more decent than this, but anyway, I find it acceptable.</t3818>
<t3819>That night, it was our turn to perform, but only about twelve people came to watch, just enough to cover the expenses.</t3819> <t3820>While watching, they couldn't stop laughing, which made the duke furious.</t3820> <t3821>Everyone left before the performance was over, leaving only a boy who was sleeping like a log.</t3821> <t3822>So the duke said that the people of Arkansas were too stupid to understand Shakespeare. He said they only liked cheap plays.</t3822> <t3823>Thinking he had grasped the taste of the locals, the next morning, he somehow got a piece of paper and some black ink and scribbled a few advertisements to post everywhere.</t3823> <t3824>The advertisement read like this:</t3824>

<t3840>Chapter XXIII</t3840>
<t3841>All day long, the duke and the king worked hard preparing, setting up the stage, hanging the curtains, climbing up to fix the lights...</t3841> <t3842>That night, the theater was packed with people coming to watch.</t3842> <t3843>When it became too crowded, the duke stopped checking tickets and went around to the back of the stage, coming out in front of the curtain to give a speech.</t3843> <t3844>He praised the tragedy endlessly and said that this was a terrifying play like no other, making everyone eager to watch it. Then he rolled up the curtain.</t3844> <t3845>A minute later, the king crawled out, not a stitch of clothing on him.</t3845> <t3846>All over his body were streaks painted in various colors, looking as dazzling as a rainbow, giving him a fierce yet comical appearance.</t3846> <t3847>The audience burst into laughter.</t3847> <t3848>After the king had jumped to the back of the stage, the audience applauded loudly, calling for the king to perform again, and then once more.</t3848> <t3849>Just seeing the ridiculous stripes that the foolish king had painted on himself would make even a cow laugh.</t3849>
<t3850>Then, the duke lowered the curtain, bowed to the audience, and said that this great play would only be performed for two more nights, as they had to return to London to perform under a signed contract, and that the tickets at Drury Lane Theatre were already sold out.</t3850> <t3851>He bowed once again, and said that if the play had pleased everyone, he hoped the audience would tell their friends and relatives to come and see it.</t3851>
<t3852>Dozens of people clamored and asked:</t3852>
<t3853>- So that's it?</t3853> <t3854>Is that all there is?</t3854>
<t3855>The Duke said that it was true.</t3855> <t3856>Then everyone shouted "Fraud!", and angrily stood up, intending to rush onto the stage and at the actors.</t3856> <t3857>But suddenly at that moment, a large, imposing man jumped onto a chair and spoke loudly:</t3857>
<t3858>- Wait a moment, I have a few words to say, gentlemen!</t3858>
<t3859>They stopped to listen.</t3859>
<t3860>- They have tricked us, tricked us blatantly.</t3860> <t3861>But we don't want the whole town to laugh at us.</t3861> <t3862>So now let's go home, and if anyone asks about this performance, let's praise it to the skies so that the following nights they will be fooled just like us.</t3862> <t3863>Does everyone agree?</t3863>
<t3864>The next day, throughout the town, everyone praised the performance as truly wonderful.</t3864> <t3865>And that night, the theater was once again packed with people.</t3865> <t3866>This time, the audience was deceived just like the night before.</t3866> <t3867>The king, the duke, and I returned to the raft for dinner, and then, around midnight, they told Jim and me to push the raft out to the middle of the river and hide it about two miles downstream from the town.</t3867>
<t3868>On the third night, the theater was packed with spectators again.</t3868> <t3869>They were not new audience members, but the same people who had watched the previous two nights.</t3869> <t3870>I stood at the door, next to the duke, noticing that everyone's bags were bulging.</t3870> <t3871>I smelled rotten eggs, rotten cabbage, and other such things.</t3871> <t3872>A total of sixty-four people had entered the theater.</t3872> <t3873>I also went inside the theater but felt so uncomfortable that I immediately went back out.</t3873> <t3874>A moment later, when all the seats were filled, the duke gave a man standing nearby twenty-five cents, asking him to guard the door for a while, then he went around to the stage.</t3874> <t3875>I followed him.</t3875> <t3876>As soon as we reached the corner of the house and stepped into the dark area, the duke said:</t3876>
<t3877>- Run out of this block, quickly.</t3877> <t3878>Then get to the hiding place for the raft, act like you're being chased by ghosts.</t3878>
<t3879>I ran, then he also ran.</t3879> <t3880>We reached the raft at the same time, and within two seconds, we had the raft in the water.</t3880> <t3881>Everything was pitch dark and silent.</t3881> <t3882>The raft reached the middle of the river, and no one said a word.</t3882> <t3883>I felt sorry for the king, thinking that he must be dead by now, still in the tent with the audience.</t3883> <t3884>But just then, he crawled out of the tent and asked:</t3884>
<t3885>- So, how much did you make this time?</t3885>
<t3886>It turns out the king did not enter the town that night.</t3886>
<t3887>We had traveled ten miles already but still didn't dare to light the lamp.</t3887> <t3888>Now we finally lit the lamp to have dinner.</t3888> <t3889>The king and the duke laughed heartily at the way they entertained the public.</t3889> <t3890>The duke said:</t3890>
<t3891>- They are all a bunch of idiots.</t3891> <t3892>I knew beforehand that the people who went to see the first night would keep their mouths shut so that all the other groups would be deceived, and I also knew they would wait until the third night to take action.</t3892> <t3893>Perhaps now they turn the theater outing into a trip with all kinds of food brought along.</t3893>
<t3894>These two rascals pocketed four hundred and sixty dollars in three nights.</t3894> <t3895>I had never seen them make so much money.</t3895> <t3896>After a while, they lay down and snored loudly.</t3896> <t3897>Jim asked me:</t3897>
<t3898>- Huck, don't you see these guys are up to something very shady</t3898><t3899>?</t3899>
<t3900>I said:</t3900>
<t3901>- No, there's nothing supernatural at all.</t3901>
<t3902>- Why not, Huck?</t3902>
<t3903>- Because I think they are all like that.</t3903>
<t3904>- Hey, Huck, all these kings are just robbers.</t3904>
<t3905>- That's right.</t3905> <t3906>As I understand it, all kings and nobles are rascals.</t3906>
<t3907>- Really?</t3907>
<t3908>- If you read books, you will see everything.</t3908> <t3909>For example, King Henry the Eighth was no better than the manager of a monastery.</t3909> <t3910>Then there was Charles the Second, Louis the Fourteenth, Louis the Fifteenth, then James the Second... etc.</t3910> <t3911>King Henry the Eighth would marry a new wife every day, and then the next morning, he would have her beheaded.</t3911> <t3912>He did this as casually as calling someone to bring up a plate of eggs.</t3912> <t3913>He would say: “Bring Nell Gwynne here!”.</t3913> <t3914>They brought her to him.</t3914> <t3915>Then the next day, he ordered: “Behead her!”.</t3915> <t3916>And so she was beheaded.</t3916> <t3917>And he made each woman tell him a story every night.</t3917> <t3918>Then he compiled those stories into the book “One Thousand and One Nights”.</t3918> <t3919>You may not know about those kings, but I know them very well.</t3919> <t3920>And the king who is with us is one of the cleanest kings in history.</t3920> <t3921>As for that Henry, he even suspected his own father, the Duke of Wellington.</t3921> <t3922>He drowned his father in a water tank like drowning a cat.</t3922> <t3923>If anyone left money near where he was sitting, he would take it all.</t3923> <t3924>He couldn't close his mouth without lying to someone about something.</t3924> <t3925>That’s the kind of scoundrel King Henry was.</t3925> <t3926>He didn't need to put on a show but blatantly forced people to give him money.</t3926>
<t3927>- But this king is also so lenient, Huck.</t3927>
<t3928>- They are all like that, Jim.</t3928> <t3929>We just have to accept it, history doesn't mention that either.</t3929>
<t3930>- Anyway, the duke's son is still better off.</t3930>
<t3931>- That's right, but not much different.</t3931> <t3932>This duke is quite impressive.</t3932> <t3933>When he is drunk, it's hard to tell him apart from the king if you look closely.</t3933>
<t3934>- Well, I don't want to hear any more stories about those kings, Huck.</t3934> <t3935>I can't stand them anymore.</t3935>
<t3936>- I think so too, Jim.</t3936> <t3937>But because we have to live with them, we must try to endure.</t3937> <t3938>Sometimes I wish to see a country without a king.</t3938>
<t3939>I also didn't want to tell Jim that these people were not real kings and dukes because it wouldn't be of any use.</t3939> <t3940>Moreover, distinguishing between real and fake is not an easy matter.</t3940>
<t3941>I went to sleep. Jim didn't wake me up but took my watch shift instead.</t3941> <t3942>When I woke up, it was already morning, and I saw Jim sitting there, his head resting on his knees, murmuring to himself.</t3942> <t3943>I understood that Jim was thinking about his wife and children far away.</t3943> <t3944>Jim was sad, homesick, because in his life, Jim had never been away from home before.</t3944> <t3945>And I believed that Jim worried about his loved ones just as much as white people worried about their own families.</t3945> <t3946>That might sound unnatural, but I thought it was probably true.</t3946> <t3947>Usually, at night, Jim would murmur like that, and sometimes when Jim thought I was asleep, he would say:</t3947>
<t3948>- Poor little Lizabeth, poor Johny.</t3948> <t3949>My poor children, I will never see you again!</t3949>
<t3950>Jim is a kind black man.</t3950>
<t3951>This time, I talked to Jim a little about his wife and children.</t3951> <t3952>He said:</t3952>
<t3953>- Today I feel so miserable because I heard in the distance, on the other side of the river, the sound of beating which reminded me of an incident with little Lizabeth.</t3953> <t3954>When she was just four years old, she had a severe fever that made her tongue twist.</t3954> <t3955>But then she recovered.</t3955> <t3956>One day she was playing outside the door, I told her:</t3956>
<t3957>- Close the door, child!</t3957>
<t3958>It didn't do anything but just stood there, only looking at me and smiling.</t3958> <t3959>I got so annoyed, I shouted loudly:</t3959>
<t3960>- Can you hear me talking?</t3960> <t3961>Close the door!</t3961>
<t3962>It just stood there laughing.</t3962> <t3963>I got really mad:</t3963>
<t3964>- Don't you listen to anything?</t3964>
<t3965>Then I slapped it on the head.</t3965> <t3966>The little girl fell to the ground.</t3966> <t3967>I went to the next room, and ten minutes later I returned to find the door still open, and the little girl still standing there, her face looking down at the ground, tears streaming down.</t3967> <t3968>Oh my God, at that moment I was furious! I was about to step forward when a gust of wind came from somewhere, and the window behind the little girl slammed shut.</t3968> <t3969>I was terrified and ran over, my whole body trembling, bending down to look at the little girl.</t3969> <t3970>She remained still as if nothing had happened.</t3970> <t3971>I burst into tears and hugged her tightly.</t3971> <t3972>I said, "Poor child of mine! May God forgive this wretched Jim."</t3972> <t3973>It turned out, the little girl had been completely mute and deaf for a long time, yet I treated her like that!</t3973>
<t3974>Chapter XXIV</t3974>
<t3975>Near the next day, we anchored the raft under a willow tree, with villages on both sides of the river.</t3975> <t3976>The duke and the king started discussing their plan of action in this town again.</t3976> <t3977>Jim told the duke not to go for too long, just a few hours, because lying all day in the tent and being tied up like that made him very tired.</t3977> <t3978>Whenever we went away, we tied Jim up so that if anyone suddenly came by and saw him tied up, they would think he had been captured.</t3978> <t3979>The duke also agreed that lying tied up all day was indeed very hard, so he would think of a better way.</t3979>
<t3980>The Duke was indeed an intelligent person.</t3980> <t3981>He came up with a plan: to dress Jim in King Lear's clothes, put a white horsehair wig on him; then he used a brush to paint Jim's face, hands, ears, and neck a bluish-gray color, making him look like someone who had been drowned for nine days.</t3981> <t3982>It was horrifying, never had anything looked so disgusting.</t3982> <t3983>Then the Duke took a piece of wood and wrote on it:</t3983>
<t3984>The Arab man is mentally ill, very dangerous when he has an outburst.</t3984>
<t3985>Then he hung that piece of wood on a tree branch, a few yards away from the tent.</t3985> <t3986>Jim was very pleased because it was better than being tied up every day, lying there trembling at every sound.</t3986> <t3987>The duke told Jim to rest assured, and if anyone wandered around, he should step out of the tent, pretend to be a madman, and howl like a wild animal, so people would be scared and run away immediately.</t3987> <t3988>That sounds good.</t3988> <t3989>But that's for anyone else; as for Jim, just seeing him would be enough to scare people without him having to howl.</t3989>
<t3990>These two rascals intended to put on a show like the one they did the other day to make some extra money.</t3990> <t3991>But then they thought it would be dangerous, and perhaps the news about the previous show had already spread down here.</t3991> <t3992>They couldn't come up with any other tricks, so the duke said he would lie down and think for another hour or two to see if he could come up with something.</t3992> <t3993>The king said if there was no new plan, he would leave his fate to the will of God.</t3993> <t3994>At the last resting place, we all bought new clothes.</t3994> <t3995>The king's clothes were jet black, making him look quite dignified.</t3995> <t3996>Never had I seen clothes change a person so much.</t3996> <t3997>Previously, he looked shabby and disheveled, but now when he took off his white hat, bowed, and smiled, he looked so solemn it seemed he could have been a Jewish rabbi. Jim cleaned the boat, and I prepared the oars.</t3997> <t3998>There was a steamboat docked to unload goods on the shore about three miles above the town.</t3998> <t3999>The king said:</t3999>
<t4000>- Just look at the way I'm dressed like this, anyone would think I'm from St. Louis or Cincinnati.</t4000> <t4001>Huck, we will take the steamboat to the village down there.</t4001>
<t4002>When it comes to getting to ride a boat, I don't need to be asked twice.</t4002> <t4003>I pushed the boat along the shore on this side for about half a mile, then looked for a spot where the water flowed gently to proceed.</t4003> <t4004>A while later, we encountered a young man who looked rustic and somewhat naive, sitting on a log, wiping the sweat off his face.</t4004> <t4005>Next to him were two large bags.</t4005>
<t4006>The king said:</t4006>
<t4007>- Point the bow towards the shore.</t4007>
<t4008>I pushed the boat back in.</t4008>
<t4009>- Hey, where are you going? - The king asked.</t4009>
<t4010>- I went to the boat to go to Orleans</t4010>
<t4011>The king said:</t4011>
<t4012>- Come up here!</t4012> <t4013>Wait, let my servant carry those bags for you.</t4013> <t4014>Jump up and help him, Adolphus.</t4014> <t4015>(He probably means me).</t4015>
<t4016>I went ashore, carried down a few bags, and then the three of us went together.</t4016> <t4017>The other man thanked profusely and said that in such hot weather, carrying these things would be truly exhausting.</t4017> <t4018>He asked where the king was going, and the old man said that this morning he went to a village up there, then walked a few more miles to visit an old friend at a nearby camp.</t4018> <t4019>The other man said:</t4019>
<t4020>- Just now when I saw you, I thought to myself this must be Mr. Wilks, but then I told myself it couldn't be because if it were Mr. Wilks, he wouldn't be going upriver like this.</t4020> <t4021>You're not Mr. Wilks, are you?</t4021>
<t4022>- No, my name is Blodgett, Elexandre Blodgett, Reverend Elexandre Blodgett, to be precise.</t4022> <t4023>But I myself am also wondering why Mr. Wilks hasn't arrived yet, or if something unfortunate has happened to him?</t4023>
<t4024>- Actually, he didn't lose anything materially.</t4024> <t4025>But he didn't make it in time to see his brother Peter, who had just died.</t4025> <t4026>It seems that the two brothers hadn't seen each other since they were young - and they also hadn't seen their younger brother named William.</t4026> <t4027>This younger brother was both mute and deaf.</t4027> <t4028>William was just over thirty, around thirty-five years old.</t4028> <t4029>Only Peter and George came to live in this area.</t4029> <t4030>George was married.</t4030> <t4031>Both husband and wife died last year.</t4031> <t4032>Now only Harvey and William are left, but they didn't make it in time.</t4032>
<t4033>- So, did anyone tell them?</t4033>
<t4034>- Yes, about two months now, since Peter first got sick.</t4034> <t4035>He's very old now.</t4035> <t4036>George's daughters are too young, they can't help him at all.</t4036> <t4037>Only Mary Jane with the red hair can.</t4037> <t4038>After George and his wife died, he felt extremely lonely and didn't want to live anymore.</t4038> <t4039>He desperately wished to see Harvey again, and William too.</t4039> <t4040>He left a letter for Harvey, in which he mentioned where he hid the money, and expressed his wish that the inheritance be divided among George's daughters, because George had nothing to leave for his children.</t4040> <t4041>That's all the letter said.</t4041>
<t4042>- Why do you think Harvey can't make it? Where is Harvey now?</t4042>
<t4043>- Over in England, in some place called Sheffield, I heard he's a pastor.</t4043> <t4044>Up until now, he has never come back here.</t4044> <t4045>He's very busy... and maybe he didn't receive Peter's letter...</t4045>
<t4046>- Poor Peter, if only he could see his brothers' faces.</t4046> <t4047>Just now, you said you were going to Orleans, right?</t4047>
<t4048>- Yes, but that's just the first leg.</t4048> <t4049>Next week, I'll board a ship to Rio de Janeiro, where my uncle lives.</t4049>
<t4050>- Going far, huh? But it must be very enjoyable.</t4050> <t4051>I also want to go very much.</t4051> <t4052>Is Mary Jane the oldest one?</t4052> <t4053>How old are the other girls?</t4053>
<t4054>- Mary Jane is nineteen, Susan is fifteen, and Joanna is fourteen.</t4054> <t4055>The youngest one has a cleft lip but is diligent in her work.</t4055>
<t4056>- Poor little girls who are orphaned.</t4056>
<t4057>- The girls should have suffered even more.</t4057> <t4058>But old Peter has many acquaintances, and they didn't let these girls suffer.</t4058> <t4059>Those people, old Peter is very close to and occasionally writes letters about them whenever he sends letters back to England; therefore, if Harvey comes here, he might also find some familiar friends.</t4059>
<t4060>The king kept asking about this matter until the young man had nothing left to say.</t4060> <t4061>Strangely, he didn't inquire about anyone else or anything else in the province, but only asked about the Wilks family.</t4061> <t4062>Then he asked about Peter's profession - a tanner, George's profession - a carpenter, and then Harvey, who is a minister...</t4062> <t4063>He asked again:</t4063>
<t4064>- Why do you have to go back up to the ship?</t4064>
<t4065>- Because it's a big ship, it can't maneuver in here, and I'm also afraid it won't dock there.</t4065> <t4066>The Cincinnati ship docks, but as for the St. Louis ship, I don't know.</t4066>
<t4067>- Is Peter Wilks wealthy?</t4067>
<t4068>- Quite wealthy.</t4068> <t4069>He has a house, land, and it is said that he left three to four thousand đồng buried somewhere.</t4069>
<t4070>- When did that old man die?</t4070>
<t4071>- Last night</t4071>
<t4072>- Will the funeral be held tomorrow?</t4072>
<t4073>- Yes, I heard it's around noon tomorrow.</t4073>
<t4074>- It's so sad; but we will all be like that eventually.</t4074> <t4075>So, we should just prepare ourselves in advance.</t4075>
<t4076>- That's right, sir.</t4076> <t4077>My mother often says the same.</t4077>
<t4078>When we arrived at the dock, the ship had almost finished unloading and was about to depart.</t4078> <t4079>The king didn't say anything about boarding the ship; as a result, I didn't get to go on the ship.</t4079> <t4080>When the ship was far away from me, the king told me to row another mile further.</t4080> <t4081>Upon reaching a deserted place, he stepped ashore and said:</t4081>
<t4082>- Now go down to bring the Duke up here, remember to bring along a few new bags of cloth as well.</t4082> <t4083>If he has gone to the other side of the river, go there to find him and tell him to come up here immediately.</t4083> <t4084>Hurry up!</t4084>
<t4085>I know what he's planning, but I won't say.</t4085> <t4086>When we brought the duke, we hid him very carefully.</t4086> <t4087>The king recounted to the duke the entire story that he had just heard.</t4087> <t4088>While talking, he tried to speak in an English accent, and it was quite convincing.</t4088> <t4089>Then he asked:</t4089>
<t4090>- Bilgewater, can you play the role of someone who is both mute and deaf?</t4090>
<t4091>The Duke said it was fine because he had once pretended to be both mute and deaf.</t4091> <t4092>So we sat there waiting for the steamboat.</t4092>
<t4093>Around early afternoon, a few small boats came by, but they didn't go far.</t4093> <t4094>A while later, a big boat arrived, and they called us in.</t4094> <t4095>A small boat was sent from the big boat to pick us up.</t4095> <t4096>All three of us boarded the boat.</t4096> <t4097>This boat came from Cincinnati.</t4097> <t4098>But when we got on the boat, they found out we only intended to travel a short distance of four or five miles, they cursed at us for a while and said they wouldn't stop to let us off.</t4098> <t4099>But the king was very calm.</t4099> <t4100>He said:</t4100>
<t4101>- If we pay one dollar per mile, will the ship agree to carry the load?</t4101>
<t4102>Hearing that, they immediately agreed and were no longer angry.</t4102> <t4103>Upon reaching the place we indicated, the ship carried us to the shore.</t4103> <t4104>More than twenty people rushed out when they saw our boat approaching.</t4104> <t4105>The king asked:</t4105>
<t4106>- Can you show me where Mr. Peter Wilks lives?</t4106>
<t4107>The people looked at each other and shook their heads sadly.</t4107> <t4108>But one person replied in a very polite voice:</t4108>
<t4109>- I'm very sorry, sir.</t4109> <t4110>But we can only tell you where he was staying last night.</t4110>
<t4111>Then suddenly, the king burst into tears, hugging the other person tightly, crying and saying:</t4111>
<t4112>- Oh dear, our unfortunate brother has passed away, we will never be able to see his face again! Oh, the pain!</t4112>
<t4113>Then the old man turned around and signaled to the duke.</t4113> <t4114>So the duke threw the two bags on the ground and burst into tears.</t4114> <t4115>I have never seen anyone as cunning as these two before.</t4115>
<t4116>The crowd gathered around, showing pity, they tried their best to console, then helped carry the two bags up the hill, allowing the two people to lean on their shoulders and cry, and recount everything about the final moments of their brother to the king.</t4116> <t4117>As for the king, he used hand signals to communicate with the duke, and both acted as if losing the brother who worked as a tanner was akin to losing a religion.</t4117> <t4118>Honestly, I never thought people could be so deceitful.</t4118>
<t4119>Chapter XXV</t4119>
<t4120>In just two minutes, the whole town knew the news.</t4120> <t4121>They rushed in from all directions.</t4121> <t4122>Moments later, we were surrounded by a crowd of people, the noise rumbling like a parade.</t4122> <t4123>Everywhere, big doors and small doors were filled with people; every now and then, someone would ask:</t4123>
<t4124>- Is that them?</t4124>
<t4125>And a voice from the crowd immediately responded:</t4125>
<t4126>- That's right.</t4126>
<t4127>We walked to Peter's house, everyone was crowded together, three girls were standing in front of the door.</t4127> <t4128>Mary Jane had red hair, but it did not affect her dazzling beauty.</t4128> <t4129>She was very happy, her face lit up, her eyes sparkled when she saw the uncles had returned.</t4129> <t4130>The king was spreading his arms wide, and Mary Jane jumped over; she ran to the duke with a split lip.</t4130> <t4131>Everyone, especially the women, cheered with joy seeing them reunite so warmly.</t4131>
<t4132>Then the king winked privately at the duke, then he looked around the house, looked at the coffin placed in the corner of the house, set on two chairs.</t4132><t4133>He, along with the duke, one hand resting on each other's shoulders, the other hand covering their faces, walked slowly and solemnly to the place where the coffin was placed.</t4133><t4134>Everyone stepped back to make room for the two to enter, all the whispering stopped, someone said "shh," then everyone took off their hats, bowed their heads to the coffin, glanced at it, and then both burst into loud sobs that could be heard all the way in Orleans.</t4134><t4135>Then they wrapped their arms around each other's necks, leaned their heads on each other's shoulders, for three minutes or maybe four without separating.</t4135><t4136>Notably, everyone else did the same, making the scene more tragic than ever seen before.</t4136><t4137>Then each stood at one end of the coffin, knelt down, rested their foreheads on the coffin so that everyone around could pray for them.</t4137><t4138>Everyone cried out loud, even those poor girls, then the ladies, no one said a word, solemnly stepped up to kiss their foreheads, then placed their hands on their heads, faces turned up to the sky, tears streaming down, then burst into sobs again, one after another.</t4138><t4139>I have never seen such a despicable scene.</t4139>
<t4140>Later, the king stood up, tears streaming down his face, and began to speak.</t4140> <t4141>He said that it was an extremely painful thing for him and his younger brother to have lost a loved one after traveling four thousand miles to return here, only to find that the unfortunate person was no longer alive; then he said that this pain was somewhat alleviated and comforted by the affection of relatives and those sacred tears, and from the bottom of his heart, he thanked everyone, then he once again burst into a series of prayers and turned to cry silently.</t4141>
<t4142>As soon as the old man finished speaking, someone in the crowd started singing a hymn, and others joined in, making the atmosphere quite eerie.</t4142> <t4143>Music really does have an effect.</t4143> <t4144>After all the king's empty words, I felt the atmosphere become much cooler and even seemed more honest.</t4144> <t4145>Then the king continued his blathering.</t4145> <t4146>He said that he and those nieces of his would be very pleased if some of the family's close friends stayed for dinner.</t4146> <t4147>He even repeated the names of the close friends he had managed to memorize.</t4147> <t4148>They stepped forward to shake the king's hand, thanked him, talked to him; then shook the duke's hand without saying anything, just smiling and nodding.</t4148>
<t4149>Then after that, the king continued to boastfully inquire about everyone, every dog in the province, calling them by name and mentioning countless trivial matters that had happened at various times in the area, or talking about George's or Peter's family. He always mentioned that Peter wrote him letters about those things exactly as the foolish fellow who had just sat on the boat had inadvertently told him.</t4149> <t4150>Then Miss Mary Jane went to get the letter her father had left behind.</t4150> <t4151>The king took that letter, read it aloud, and cried again.</t4151> <t4152>The letter stated that the house and three thousand gold dollars were left for the daughters; the tannery (worth seven thousand dollars) and three thousand gold dollars were left for Harvey and William.</t4152> <t4153>The letter said that all six thousand gold dollars were hidden in the cellar.</t4153> <t4154>So the two swindlers said they would go find that money to make things clear and definite.</t4154> <t4155>They told me to come along, bringing a candle with me.</t4155> <t4156>We stepped down and closed the cellar door.</t4156> <t4157>When they saw the bundle of money, they poured it all out onto the ground, looking incredibly bright and beautiful, all shimmering gold!</t4157> <t4158>The king's eyes lit up! He slapped the duke on the shoulder and said:</t4158>
<t4159>- See? Isn't it wonderful? It's way better than your theatrical performances, right?</t4159>
<t4160>The Duke nodded in acknowledgment.</t4160> <t4161>The two people fondled and felt the gold coin, squeezing it repeatedly in their palms, then let it fall to the ground.</t4161> <t4162>Then the king said:</t4162>
<t4163>- No need to think about it anymore.</t4163> <t4164>We are now making a brotherhood with a wealthy dead man.</t4164> <t4165>Do you believe in God now? I've managed a lot, there's no better way.</t4165>
<t4166>Although very happy with the money, the two swindlers still counted it again and were annoyed to find four hundred and fifteen dollars missing.</t4166>
<t4167>The king said:</t4167>
<t4168>- Damn it, what did he do with those four hundred and fifteen dollars?</t4168>
<t4169>Both of them searched around in the cellar for a while, then the duke said:</t4169>
<t4170>- He must have been too sick and counted wrong.</t4170> <t4171>It's better to stay silent.</t4171> <t4172>We'll just share the loss there.</t4172>
<t4173>- We can bear the loss of that shortage, but we must go up there, open the package, and count the money in front of everyone, so that no one has any doubts.</t4173> <t4174>But the deceased said there was a total of six thousand dollars, so we don't want this amount to be short.</t4174>
<t4175>The Duke said:</t4175>
<t4176>- Alright, let me make up for that shortfall.</t4176>
<t4177>The king said:</t4177>
<t4178>- Your opinion is truly insightful.</t4178> <t4179>You are indeed an exceptionally intelligent person.</t4179> <t4180>It's really unfortunate that the act of pretending no longer helps us.</t4180>
<t4181>Then the old man took off his shirt and emptied the rest of his pockets.</t4181>
<t4182>They were overjoyed, because the amount of money they spent was exactly six thousand dollars.</t4182>
<t4183>The Duke said:</t4183>
<t4184>- Hey, I thought of something else.</t4184> <t4185>Let's go upstairs and count this money, then give it all to the girls.</t4185>
<t4186>- Wonderful, Duke.</t4186> <t4187>Let me give you a hug and a kiss.</t4187> <t4188>What a brilliant idea.</t4188> <t4189>You are truly a master, beyond any criticism.</t4189> <t4190>Even if they still have doubts about us, this action will dispel them immediately.</t4190>
<t4191>We went up to the main house and saw everyone sitting around the table.</t4191> <t4192>The king took out a bundle of money, counted it, and separated it into piles of three hundred dollars each, making a total of twenty small piles, which looked very pleasing to the eye.</t4192> <t4193>Everyone licked their lips, appearing eager.</t4193> <t4194>After putting the money back into the bundle, the king stood up and gave another speech.</t4194> <t4195>He said:</t4195>
<t4196>- Dear all, my poor brother has shown great generosity towards the living.</t4196> <t4197>He has thought of the young children he loved and protected, who are now without parents.</t4197> <t4198>Yes, we also understand that our brother wanted to care for them even more, but perhaps he was also concerned about William and me, fearing that the bond of brotherhood might not be complete.</t4198> <t4199>But in my heart, I truly did not think of that.</t4199> <t4200>I could not bring myself to take away the money from the young nieces and nephews whom my brother cherished so much...</t4200> <t4201>Perhaps William will not oppose me either.</t4201> <t4202>Alright, I will ask their uncle.</t4202>
<t4203>The old man turned around and signaled to the worker.</t4203> <t4204>The man looked at the old man with a dumbfounded, fearful expression for a moment, then suddenly seemed to understand what the old man meant, ran over to the king, uttered a few incoherent sounds of joy, and hugged the old man tightly for fifteen minutes before letting go.</t4204> <t4205>Then the king spoke again:</t4205>
<t4206>- I know, he is also very willing to do as I do.</t4206> <t4207>Mary Jane, Susan, Joanna, you all take this money.</t4207> <t4208>This is a gift left by your father, though it may seem cold, it will be useful for you.</t4208>
<t4209>Mary Jane walked over to the king, while Susan and the harelip girl went to the duke, hugging him tightly and kissing him. I had never seen such intense kissing before.</t4209> <t4210>Then everyone gathered around, tears streaming down their faces, and everyone shook hands with those two swindlers.</t4210> <t4211>Everyone said:</t4211>
<t4212>- How precious!</t4212> <t4213>You all are such good people.</t4213>
<t4214>Moments later, everyone resumed talking about the unfortunate person.</t4214> <t4215>They spoke of how kind he was, how much of a loss his death was...</t4215> <t4216>Suddenly, a man with a square jaw walked in from outside.</t4216> <t4217>That person just stood there listening and watching, not saying a word, and no one spoke to him either, because they were all engrossed in listening to the king speak.</t4217> <t4218>The king was in the middle of speaking, and he said this:</t4218>
<t4219>- ...</t4219> <t4220>You are close friends of my brother, so tonight I invite you all to stay here.</t4220> <t4221>We hope that tomorrow everyone else will also come, because when he was alive, my brother loved everyone.</t4221> <t4222>We also want to hold a proper funeral for him so that the public can be informed.</t4222>
<t4223>Then, the old man just kept rambling on as if he were talking only to himself.</t4223> <t4224>Every now and then, he would bring up the funeral arrangements again, to the point where the duke standing nearby could no longer bear it and wrote a few words on a small piece of paper.</t4224> <t4225>"It's called a funeral, not a burial," then folded the small piece of paper and passed it over everyone's heads to the king.</t4225> <t4226>The king took the piece of paper, read it, put it in his pocket, and then said:</t4226>
<t4227>- Poor William, his uncle is always so considerate, reminding me to invite everyone to the funeral and telling me to welcome everyone properly.</t4227> <t4228>But he can rest assured, I have thought the same way.</t4228>
<t4229>Then the old man continued the story, occasionally mixing up the words "funeral" and "burial."</t4229> <t4230>When he said it for the third time, he explained:</t4230>
<t4231>- I often say "cất đám" instead of "tang lễ" because although "tang lễ" is a common term, it is rarely used in England nowadays.</t4231>
<t4232>That old man is really shameless, I have never seen anyone like that.</t4232> <t4233>Then, that man laughed in the king's face.</t4233> <t4234>Everyone showed their displeasure.</t4234> <t4235>They spoke.</t4235>
<t4236>- Oh, look, Dr. Robinson, haven't you heard the news?</t4236> <t4237>This is Harvy Wilks.</t4237>
<t4238>The king laughed heartily, extended his hand to shake, and asked:</t4238>
<t4239>- Is that the doctor, the good friend of my poor brother? I...</t4239>
<t4240>- Don't touch me.</t4240> <t4241>- The man replied - You said you are an Englishman, didn't you?</t4241> <t4242>That is the worst imitation I have ever seen.</t4242> <t4243>Are you Peter Wilks' brother? No, you are just a big fraud.</t4243>
<t4244>Everyone was stunned, gathering around the doctor, intending to advise him not to be so harsh, and trying to explain that it was indeed Harvey because he knew everyone's names, even the names of the dogs.</t4244> <t4245>They kept pleading with the doctor not to do anything to harm Harvey and those poor girls.</t4245> <t4246>But it was useless, the doctor kept making a fuss, saying that anyone who claimed to be English but couldn't speak properly was just a fraud, a liar...</t4246> <t4247>The poor girls clung tightly to the king and cried.</t4247> <t4248>Suddenly, the doctor turned towards the girls and said:</t4248>
<t4249>- I am a friend of your father, and I am also a friend of yours.</t4249> <t4250>Therefore, I want to protect you and keep you from being harmed by others.</t4250> <t4251>You must immediately throw that rogue out the door.</t4251> <t4252>He is just a common impostor who has come here with some knowledge he accidentally stole from somewhere.</t4252> <t4253>And there are even madmen here helping you believe it further.</t4253> <t4254>Mary Jane Wilks, you know that I have no interest in any profit in this matter.</t4254> <t4255>Listen to me, throw that scoundrel out.</t4255> <t4256>I beg you, will you agree?</t4256>
<t4257>Mary Jane stood up straight and said decisively:</t4257>
<t4258>- This is my answer. - I said, as she lifted the bundle of money and placed it into the king's hand - You take all these six thousand dollars, and you invest it for me and my two siblings, wherever and however you see fit, we don't need to sign any receipt at all.</t4258>
<t4259>Then she stepped aside, wrapped her arms around the king, while Susan and the girl with the cleft lip came to stand on the other side.</t4259> <t4260>Everyone applauded, stomping loudly on the floor.</t4260> <t4261>The king looked up and smiled proudly.</t4261>
<t4262>The doctor said:</t4262>
<t4263>- Fine.</t4263> <t4264>I won't be involved in this matter anymore.</t4264> <t4265>But I must say in advance that there will come a time when you will regret thinking about today.</t4265>
<t4266>Then he stepped out.</t4266>
<t4267>The king replied with a sarcastic tone:</t4267>
<t4268>- Very well, doctor, we will try to come to see you.</t4268>
<t4269>Everyone burst into laughter, and they said that it was the most profound sarcastic remark.</t4269>

<t4272>Chapter XXVI</t4272>
<t4273>When everyone had left, the king asked Mary Jane if there was any room left to rest.</t4273> <t4274>She said there was a spare room for Uncle William, her own room would be for the old man because he was larger, and she would move to her sisters' room and sleep on a small bed.</t4274> <t4275>There was also a spot upstairs with a bed.</t4275> <t4276>The king said that spot would be for his servant - that is, me.</t4276>
<t4277>Mary Jane showed them the guest room.</t4277> <t4278>The room looked quite ordinary, but it was tidy and clean.</t4278> <t4279>She said she would move her clothes and personal items out of the room if Uncle Hary wanted, but the king declined.</t4279> <t4280>Her clothes were hung on the wall, covered by a fabric curtain that reached down to the wooden floor. In one corner, there were two small boxes containing jewelry.</t4280> <t4281>In the other corner, there was a music box and other toys; it seemed the girls only sat and played together in this room.</t4281> <t4282>The king said to leave it as it was to maintain a homely atmosphere and keep it cheerful, without moving anything.</t4282> <t4283>The duke's room was smaller but also quite nice.</t4283> <t4284>As for my room, it was just okay.</t4284>
<t4285>That night, they had a grand feast.</t4285> <t4286>All the gentlemen and ladies were present.</t4286> <t4287>I stood behind the king and the duke to serve, while the black servants attended to the other guests.</t4287> <t4288>Mary Jane sat at the head of the table, with Susan beside her; she criticized all the dishes, saying the cake was poorly made, the meat was terrible, and the fried chicken was too tough.</t4288> <t4289>Women often have such a tone, just to subtly remind others to praise them.</t4289> <t4290>But the other diners found every dish delicious.</t4290> <t4291>They said:</t4291>
<t4292>- How do you make the cakes smell so good? Where do you find such delicious vegetables? ... etc.</t4292>
<t4293>When everyone had finished eating, the girl with the cleft lip and I took the leftovers down to the kitchen to eat together.</t4293> <t4294>Meanwhile, the others helped the black man clean up the tables and chairs.</t4294> <t4295>The girl with the cleft lip asked me about England. It was truly embarrassing; if there had been a crack in the ground, I would have crawled right into it.</t4295> <t4296>She asked:</t4296>
<t4297>- Have you ever seen the King of England?</t4297>
<t4298>- Oh, William the Fourth? Of course, he still often attends services at our church.</t4298>
<t4299>I know that William has been dead for a long time, but I just ignore it.</t4299> <t4300>Seeing me say that the king often goes to church at my place, she asked again:</t4300>
<t4301>- What? Going to the ceremony already?</t4301>
<t4302>- Yes, let's go right away.</t4302> <t4303>His seat is right in front of where we are; on the side where the sermon is given.</t4303>
<t4304>- I thought he was in London?</t4304>
<t4305>- Yes, he is in London, where else would he be?</t4305>
<t4306>- But I thought you were in Sheffield?</t4306>
<t4307>I became confused.</t4307> <t4308>I had to pretend that a chicken bone was stuck in my throat to have time to think.</t4308> <t4309>Then I said:</t4309>
<t4310>- I mean to say that he often attends services at our church whenever he comes to Sheffield. That's only during the summer, but when he goes to the beach, you know.</t4310>
<t4311>- What are you talking about! Sheffield is not near the sea</t4311>
<t4312>- Who said it's near the sea?</t4312>
<t4313>- I just said it.</t4313>
<t4314>- When did I say that?</t4314>
<t4315>- You were the one who just said it.</t4315>
<t4316>- No, I won't say.</t4316>
<t4317>- He did say.</t4317>
<t4318>- I never said that.</t4318>
<t4319>- So what did you just say?</t4319>
<t4320>- I said that he came to swim in the sea.</t4320>
<t4321>- Okay, how could he go swimming in the sea when Sheffield is not near the sea?</t4321>
<t4322>- Have you ever seen the water at Congress?</t4322>
<t4323>- Then</t4323>
<t4324>- So, do you have to go there to get water?</t4324>
<t4325>- What are you going to do?</t4325>
<t4326>- Then King William doesn't need to go all the way to the sea to bathe.</t4326>
<t4327>- So how do we do it?</t4327>
<t4328>- Then do as everyone here does, go get Congress water, which means getting it into a barrel.</t4328> <t4329>In the palace in Sheffield, there is a stove, and he wants to bathe in hot seawater.</t4329>
<t4330>- So, I understand now.</t4330> <t4331>If only you had said it from the beginning, we wouldn't have wasted time.</t4331>
<t4332>When she said that, I felt very relieved and pleased.</t4332> <t4333>After that, she asked again:</t4333>
<t4334>- So, do you go to church?</t4334>
<t4335>- Yes, let's go right away</t4335>
<t4336>- Where are you sitting!</t4336>
<t4337>- Sit in the chair.</t4337>
<t4338>- Whose chair is this?</t4338>
<t4339>- Mr. Harvey's chair.</t4339>
<t4340>- Does he need a chair?</t4340>
<t4341>- There must be a seat to sit on, right? What did you think it was for?</t4341>
<t4342>- I thought you were going to stand up and give a lecture?</t4342>
<t4343>It's a complete disaster, I totally forgot that her uncle is a pastor.</t4343> <t4344>So I had to pretend to choke on a chicken bone again to think.</t4344> <t4345>Then I said:</t4345>
<t4346>- So you think that there is only one person preaching in the church?</t4346>
<t4347>- What is there to do?</t4347>
<t4348>- To preach in front of the king.</t4348> <t4349>You're really strange. My church has up to seventeen pastors.</t4349>
<t4350>- Seventeen pastors? If that's the case, it would take a whole week to finish the sermon</t4350><t4351>?</t4351>
<t4352>- Not all of those people lecture in one day, only one person does.</t4352>
<t4353>- So, what are those people doing?</t4353>
<t4354>- Then sit around the fire, go collect money, or do this and that.</t4354> <t4355>But mostly, they do nothing at all.</t4355>
<t4356>- What did they go there to do?</t4356>
<t4357>- That is their duty.</t4357> <t4358>She doesn't know anything.</t4358>
<t4359>- I don't need to know such nonsense anymore.</t4359> <t4360>I ask you this: in England, how are the servants treated?</t4360> <t4361>Is it better than how we treat the black people here?</t4361>
<t4362>- No, there, they don't give a damn about the servants.</t4362> <t4363>They treat them worse than dogs.</t4363>
<t4364>- Do they give holidays like they do here?</t4364> <t4365>For example, Christmas, New Year, or National Day?</t4365>
<t4366>- It's true that you have never been to England, Miss... I mean, Miss Joanna.</t4366> <t4367>Over there from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, there's no circus, no theater, nothing at all.</t4367>
<t4368>- Not going to church anymore either?</t4368>
<t4369>- Yes, not going to church.</t4369>
<t4370>- So why are you still allowed to go to church?</t4370>
<t4371>Once again, I was at a loss for words.</t4371> <t4372>I had forgotten that I was her uncle's servant.</t4372> <t4373>But then I hurriedly explained that I was a close servant and thus had the freedom to go to church or not, as the law permitted.</t4373> <t4374>However, my explanation wasn't very convincing, and she seemed displeased.</t4374> <t4375>She said.</t4375>
<t4376>- Hey, have you been deceiving me all this time?</t4376>
<t4377>I replied:</t4377>
<t4378>- I'm telling the truth.</t4378>
<t4379>- Right?</t4379>
<t4380>- Correct.</t4380>
<t4381>- Put your hand on this holy book and repeat after me.</t4381>
<t4382>To me, whether it's a scripture or any other book, it makes no difference, so I put my hand on it and repeated.</t4382> <t4383>She seemed a bit more satisfied.</t4383> <t4384>She said:</t4384>
<t4385>- Alright, I believe some of it but not all.</t4385>
<t4386>Mary Jane walked in from the door with Susan and said:</t4386>
<t4387>- Joanna, what don't you believe?</t4387> <t4388>He's someone who came from afar, it's not good for you to say that.</t4388> <t4389>What if people treated you the same way?</t4389>
<t4390>- You always defend others unconditionally.</t4390> <t4391>I didn't do anything to him.</t4391> <t4392>He made up some fabricated stories, and I said I didn't believe them, that's all.</t4392> <t4393>He probably couldn't stand those things either, right?</t4393>
<t4394>- Whether it's a small matter or a big one, he's a guest in our house, you shouldn't say that.</t4394> <t4395>If you were in his position, you would feel embarrassed.</t4395> <t4396>You shouldn't say things that make others feel embarrassed.</t4396>
<t4397>- But, he said that...</t4397>
<t4398>- She doesn't care about what he says.</t4398> <t4399>The important thing is that you must treat him well, and make him feel like he is living abroad, among strangers.</t4399>
<t4400>I thought to myself:</t4400>
<t4401>- A girl like that, and we let that despicable old man take all her money!</t4401>
<t4402>Then Miss Susan scolded her again, making her lip split.</t4402>
<t4403>I thought to myself:</t4403>
<t4404>- This is the second girl that I am letting that old man take all the money from.</t4404>
<t4405>Then Mary Jane spoke again, though her voice remained gentle and affectionate, which was her way of speaking.</t4405> <t4406>After speaking, the poor cleft-lipped girl burst into tears.</t4406>
<t4407>The two older sisters said:</t4407>
<t4408>- Now, you have to apologize to him.</t4408>
<t4409>She apologized, and her apology was very adorable.</t4409> <t4410>I was moved when I heard it and wished I could tell a thousand lies just to hear her apologize again.</t4410>
<t4411>I silently thought to myself:</t4411>
<t4412>- This is the third girl that I am letting that old man take all the money from.</t4412>
<t4413>Then, they went outside so I could be at ease and feel like I was living among close friends.</t4413> <t4414>I felt so wicked and despicable, and thought I must find a way to hide that money for them.</t4414>
<t4415>I walked outside, thinking aimlessly, then went to sleep.</t4415> <t4416>Waking up, lying alone, I thought about that matter again.</t4416> <t4417>I asked myself if I should go to that doctor’s house to expose this deceit?</t4417> <t4418>That’s impossible.</t4418> <t4419>He would reveal who the accuser is, and the king and the duke might beat me to death.</t4419> <t4420>Or should I go and talk privately to Miss Mary Jane? That wouldn’t work either.</t4420> <t4421>What if she becomes suspicious and they find out, they would take the money and run away.</t4421> <t4422>There’s only one best way: I will steal that money, and steal it in such a way that they won’t suspect me.</t4422> <t4423>They are making a good profit, as long as they haven’t taken everything, they won’t leave.</t4423> <t4424>So I still have enough time to plan this.</t4424> <t4425>I will steal the money bag and hide it.</t4425> <t4426>Then I will leave, and write Miss Mary Jane a letter, telling her where I hid the money.</t4426> <t4427>If I can hide it tonight, I should do it immediately; because that doctor hasn’t given up and will continue to investigate, and they might get scared and run away, who knows.</t4427>
<t4428>Thinking so, I groped my way to their room.</t4428> <t4429>The hallway upstairs was pitch dark, but I still found the duke's room.</t4429> <t4430>I reached out and felt around, but then I suddenly remembered that it seemed the king didn't let anyone but the old man keep that money.</t4430> <t4431>I groped my way to the old man's room and felt around.</t4431> <t4432>It was too dark, there wasn't a single candle, and even if there was, I wouldn't dare light it.</t4432> <t4433>I had to lie here and listen to see what would happen.</t4433> <t4434>At that moment, I heard their footsteps approaching, so I crawled under the bed, but thinking that spot wasn't safe, I felt worried and then touched Mary Jane's clothes curtain, so I slipped right into the curtain and hid among the clothes, standing there very quietly.</t4434>
<t4435>We entered the room and then closed the door.</t4435> <t4436>The first thing the duke did was bend down to look under the bed.</t4436> <t4437>Fortunately, I was not hiding under the bed.</t4437> <t4438>Whenever people intend to investigate someone's private matters, they often hide under the bed.</t4438> <t4439>They sat down, and the king said:</t4439>
<t4440>- Say what you need to quickly.</t4440> <t4441>We still have to go down there and take care of the funeral, sitting here any longer just gives them more reason to gossip.</t4441>
<t4442>- I'm very worried.</t4442> <t4443>That doctor will cause trouble for us, just wait and see.</t4443> <t4444>I've just thought of a plan, I wonder what you think about it.</t4444>
<t4445>- What plan?</t4445>
<t4446>- Let's sneak out of here before three in the morning, taking all our belongings to the raft and heading downstream.</t4446> <t4447>Getting that amount of money is more than enough.</t4447> <t4448>I'll sneak out first to arrange things.</t4448>
<t4449>Hearing him say that, I felt too much and became disappointed.</t4449>
<t4450>The king interrupted and asked:</t4450>
<t4451>- And what about the unsold assets, eight or nine thousand dollars, not a small amount.</t4451> <t4452>And they're all good, all things that can fetch a good price.</t4452>
<t4453>The duke grumbled, saying that the bag of money was already enough, there was no need to be too greedy - and they shouldn't take everything from the orphaned girls either.</t4453>
<t4454>The king said:</t4454>
<t4455>- This guy speaks strangely.</t4455> <t4456>We didn't steal anything else besides this money.</t4456> <t4457>The person who buys the property is the one who gets deceived, because when they find out this property doesn't belong to them, it will become state property.</t4457> <t4458>Then the house will return to those orphaned girls.</t4458> <t4459>That's enough.</t4459> <t4460>They are still young, still cry, and can easily make a living.</t4460> <t4461>Just think, thousands, thousands of dong are about to fall into our hands.</t4461> <t4462>They have nothing to complain about.</t4462>
<t4463>The king's reasoning even swayed the duke.</t4463> <t4464>But he was still worried about staying because he feared that doctor might cause trouble.</t4464> <t4465>But the king said:</t4465>
<t4466>- Ignore that doctor! Why worry so much? Plenty of fools in this town are on our side.</t4466> <t4467>We've got the majority already.</t4467>
<t4468>After speaking, the two prepared to go downstairs.</t4468> <t4469>The Duke said:</t4469>
<t4470>- I think keeping money like that is not secure.</t4470>
<t4471>Hearing that, I was overjoyed.</t4471> <t4472>So I no longer had to struggle with the search.</t4472> <t4473>The king asked</t4473>
<t4474>- Why?</t4474>
<t4475>- Because Mary Jane will have to go into this room to get the mourning clothes, the black servants cleaning the room and arranging the furniture neatly might see the bundle of money and borrow some, right?</t4475>
<t4476>The king said:</t4476>
<t4477>- You are very wise.</t4477>
<t4478>Then the old man went into the place with the clothes curtain, just about a meter away from me.</t4478> <t4479>I pressed myself tightly against the wall, standing very still, even though I had already started to tremble.</t4479> <t4480>I was thinking about what I would say if they caught me here when the king took out a money pouch and stuffed it under the mattress, pushing it in about a meter deep.</t4480> <t4481>They said that place was safe because the black man who tidied the bed would only work on the surface.</t4481> <t4482>I waited until they were halfway down the stairs, then took out the money pouch, ran upstairs to where I slept, and hid it in a spot until a more convenient time.</t4482> <t4483>I thought it might be better to hide it somewhere outside this house.</t4483> <t4484>Because if they noticed it was missing, they would thoroughly search the house first.</t4484>
<t4485>Then I went back into the house, my clothes neat and tidy.</t4485> <t4486>I wanted to sleep but couldn't because I was worried about this matter.</t4486> <t4487>A little later, the king and the duke came back up; I lay on the mattress, poking my head out near the stair railing, waiting to see if anything would happen.</t4487> <t4488>But nothing happened.</t4488>
<t4489>So I waited until it was quiet, then he gently grasped the stair railing and went downstairs.</t4489>
<t4490>Chapter XXVII</t4490>
<t4491>I leaned my ear close to the door of the conman's room; they were snoring loudly.</t4491> <t4492>I tiptoed down the stairs.</t4492> <t4493>There wasn't a sound around.</t4493> <t4494>I peeked through the crack of the dining room door and saw that the people watching over the coffin were fast asleep.</t4494> <t4495>The dining room door led to the living room.</t4495> <t4496>The coffin was there.</t4496> <t4497>Each room had a candle lit.</t4497> <t4498>I walked through; the living room door was still open, but there was no one there, only Peter's corpse. So, I slipped outside quietly, but the front door was locked.</t4498> <t4499>Just then, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs, right behind me.</t4499> <t4500>I ran into the living room, glanced around quickly, and saw that besides the coffin, there was nowhere to hide.</t4500> <t4501>The coffin lid was left open a few inches, revealing the face of the dead person covered with a wet cloth, along with the burial cloth.</t4501> <t4502>I hurriedly slipped the money bundle under the coffin lid, right under the crossed hands of the dead person.</t4502> <t4503>When I touched it, I felt a chill run through my body.</t4503> <t4504>Then I dashed through the dining room and hid behind the door.</t4504>
<t4505>The person who just walked in is Miss Mary Jane.</t4505> <t4506>She went to the coffin, knelt down to look inside, took out a handkerchief, and sobbed quietly, her back turned to me.</t4506> <t4507>I stepped outside, passing through the dining room, to make sure that the people keeping watch didn't see me, so I stopped and peered through the crack in the door.</t4507> <t4508>They didn't move at all, which was reassuring.</t4508>
<t4509>I went back to bed, still scared because of what I had just done, arduous and dangerous.</t4509> <t4510>I planned that when we traveled about a hundred miles downstream, I could write a letter to inform Miss Mary Jane, and she could dig up the grave to retrieve the money.</t4510> <t4511>But what if things didn't go as planned, and when they closed the coffin, they discovered the money hidden inside?</t4511> <t4512>In that case, the king would get it again, and I wouldn't have a chance to retrieve it.</t4512> <t4513>At this moment, I wanted to crawl down and get the money bag out.</t4513> <t4514>But I didn't dare to leave anymore.</t4514> <t4515>The sky was gradually getting brighter.</t4515> <t4516>The people keeping watch had started to wake up.</t4516> <t4517>If I went down again, I could very likely get caught with six thousand dollars in hand.</t4517> <t4518>It's best not to get involved in that matter anymore.</t4518>
<t4519>In the morning, I went downstairs to find the living room door closed, and the guards had all left.</t4519> <t4520>Only the household members, the widow Barley, and us remained.</t4520> <t4521>I carefully examined their faces to see if there were any changes, but I saw nothing different.</t4521> <t4522>By noon, the funeral director arrived with another person.</t4522> <t4523>They carried the coffin to the middle of the house, placed it on two chairs, then arranged all the other chairs in rows, even borrowing more chairs from neighboring houses to fill both the dining room and the living room.</t4523> <t4524>I looked at the coffin lid and saw it was still the same, but because there were many people around, I didn't dare to step closer to look inside.</t4524>
<t4525>Later, many people gradually arrived.</t4525> <t4526>The two swindlers and the girls sat in the front row of seats right by the coffin.</t4526> <t4527>For half an hour, the procession of people slowly walked around the coffin, eyes fixed on the deceased for a minute with a solemn, respectful expression.</t4527> <t4528>The girls and the two swindlers dabbed their faces with handkerchiefs and then bowed down, sobbing.</t4528> <t4529>Only the sound of shuffling feet on the floor and the sniffles could be heard, because people tend to sniffle more at a funeral than in other places, sometimes even more than in church.</t4529>
<t4530>When everyone had arrived, the funeral director stepped out, wearing black gloves, with a very calm demeanor.</t4530> <t4531>He made final preparations, arranging for everyone to be seated somewhere.</t4531> <t4532>He didn't say anything; directing one person here, urging another there, clearing pathways from one place to another, all done with nods and hand signals.</t4532> <t4533>Then he stood close to the wall.</t4533> <t4534>He was truly a gentle, graceful person like no other.</t4534> <t4535>It seemed he never smiled.</t4535>
<t4536>They had already borrowed an old accordion.</t4536> <t4537>When everyone was ready, a young woman sat down and began to play music, which sounded so mournful it could break your heart.</t4537> <t4538>Everyone sang along to the tune.</t4538> <t4539>Then Father Hobson solemnly, slowly began to speak.</t4539> <t4540>Just as the priest was about to start speaking, a terrible noise suddenly echoed from downstairs.</t4540> <t4541>It was the barking of a dog.</t4541> <t4542>The priest had to stand by the coffin waiting until the dog stopped barking, otherwise no one would hear what he was saying.</t4542> <t4543>But the undertaker raised his hand to signal to the priest as if to say, "Don't worry, I've got this."</t4543> <t4544>He bent down and walked along the wall, yet his shoulders still stood out above everyone else.</t4544> <t4545>The dog's barking grew louder and louder.</t4545> <t4546>He passed through two rooms and then turned downstairs.</t4546> <t4547>Two seconds later, I heard a loud bang, the dog howled a few more times, and then it fell silent.</t4547> <t4548>Only then did the priest solemnly begin the sermon.</t4548> <t4549>A few minutes later, the undertaker walked back along the wall, his head and shoulders bobbing past several walls in the room, then he stood up straight, covered his mouth with his hand, stretched his neck over everyone's heads towards the priest, and whispered in a slightly sharp tone: "It caught a rat," then bent down and walked back to his original spot.</t4549> <t4550>Everyone seemed very pleased, as they had been curious to know what was happening.</t4550> <t4551>Such a small matter wasn't worth knowing, but everyone paid great attention to it.</t4551> <t4552>In this town, the undertaker was the most well-known person.</t4552>
<t4553>The pastor's sermon was good but too long.</t4553> <t4554>Then, after that, the king came out and babbled for a while.</t4554> <t4555>When everything was done, the funeral director approached the coffin with a wrench to tighten the screws.</t4555> <t4556>At that moment, I was very nervous, my eyes fixed on the funeral director.</t4556> <t4557>But he just slowly and gently lowered the lid, then tightened the screws very firmly.</t4557> <t4558>That's it! I wondered what if someone deceitful had already taken the money bundle out?</t4558> <t4559>Should I write a letter to Mary Jane?</t4559> <t4560>What if I write it and she digs up the grave and finds nothing, what would she think of me?</t4560> <t4561>I might even end up in jail.</t4561> <t4562>It's better not to write anything at all.</t4562> <t4563>Everything in my head was now all mixed up.</t4563> <t4564>The more I thought about it, the more complicated it seemed, so I decided to just let it be.</t4564>
<t4565>After the burial was finished, we returned home.</t4565> <t4566>I once again paid attention to the faces to see what I could find, but I found nothing in those expressions; I couldn't understand.</t4566>
<t4567>In the evening, the king visited familiar people, pretending to be friendly.</t4567> <t4568>The old man said that his parishioners in England were eagerly waiting for him, so he had to quickly arrange and settle everything to return.</t4568> <t4569>The old man said he regretted having to rush like that.</t4569> <t4570>Everyone said the same, they wished he could stay longer.</t4570> <t4571>The old man also said that he and William would take those nieces back to their country.</t4571> <t4572>Hearing that, everyone was happy for the girls who would have relatives to rely on.</t4572> <t4573>The girls were also delighted to hear him say that.</t4573> <t4574>The girls urged him to sell the house and land quickly.</t4574> <t4575>The more joyful they were, the more heartbroken I felt seeing them being deceived.</t4575> <t4576>But I had no way to change the situation.</t4576>
<t4577>After that, the king announced the sale of the house, property, and the black workers who worked there two days after the burial, but before that, anyone who wanted to buy anything separately could do so.</t4577>
<t4578>The next day, after the funeral was over, the girls' joys encountered their first obstacle.</t4578> <t4579>A few slave traders came by, and the king sold all the black people working in the house at a reasonable price and took a promissory note.</t4579> <t4580>Thus, the black people left one by one.</t4580> <t4581>The two sons went up to Memphis, while the mother went down to Orleans.</t4581> <t4582>The mistresses and they hugged each other, crying with infinite sorrow.</t4582> <t4583>The girls said they never expected to see the family separated and to have to sell them off like this.</t4583> <t4584>They hugged each other and cried continuously, making me want to immediately expose the scoundrels so that the black people could stay with their mistresses. The sale made everyone in the town resentful, considering it cruel.</t4584> <t4585>The honor of the two old swindlers was slightly diminished.</t4585> <t4586>But that crazy old man insisted on doing things his way, despite the duke's objections.</t4586>
<t4587>The next day was the auction day.</t4587> <t4588>At dawn, the king and the duke went upstairs to wake me up.</t4588> <t4589>Seeing their faces, I immediately guessed that something was up.</t4589> <t4590>The king asked:</t4590>
<t4591>- The night before, did you come into my room?</t4591>
<t4592>- No, Your Majesty, - When it's just us, I usually address him like that.</t4592>
<t4593>- So, did you come in last night?</t4593>
<t4594>- Your Majesty, do you have a letter?</t4594>
<t4595>- Swear on your honor, you must not lie.</t4595>
<t4596>- I swear on my honor that I'm telling the truth.</t4596> <t4597>Since Miss Mary Jane took the king and the duke upstairs, I haven't gone near there at all.</t4597>
<t4598>The Duke asked:</t4598>
<t4599>- Did you see anyone come there?</t4599>
<t4600>- Sir, I don't remember very clearly</t4600>
<t4601>- Try to remember.</t4601>
<t4602>I remained silent to think if there was any way to speak, then replied.</t4602>
<t4603>- Yes, I saw some black people go in there.</t4603>
<t4604>Both of them were startled, then the duke asked again:</t4604>
<t4605>- All of them are black people</t4605><t4606>?</t4606>
<t4607>- No, not all at once, I only saw it once.</t4607>
<t4608>- When?</t4608>
<t4609>- On the day of the funeral, but not early in the morning, I also woke up late.</t4609> <t4610>As I was stepping down the stairs, I saw them.</t4610>
<t4611>- Go ahead! What else did they do?</t4611> <t4612>How did they do it?</t4612>
<t4613>- They were just gentle.</t4613> <t4614>I think they went in there to clean the king's room.</t4614> <t4615>Perhaps the king had already woken up, but they saw him still lying down, so they quietly left to avoid disturbing him.</t4615>
<t4616>Both looked at each other sadly, dejectedly.</t4616> <t4617>The king said:</t4617>
<t4618>- This way, everything is ruined.</t4618>
<t4619>The Duke pondered for a moment, then let out a sneer and said:</t4619>
<t4620>- The black folks played a high-level trick.</t4620> <t4621>They pretended to be very miserable before they left this place.</t4621> <t4622>I, you, and everyone else thought so.</t4622> <t4623>Don't think that the black folks don't have any talent.</t4623> <t4624>If I had the capital and a theater, I would immediately hire them as actors.</t4624> <t4625>So now we have sold them in exchange for a song.</t4625> <t4626>And yet we haven't even sung that song. By the way, where is that song, that contract?</t4626><t4627>Where?</t4627>
<t4628>- You have to go to the bank to get it!</t4628>
<t4629>- Well, that's still quite fortunate.</t4629>
<t4630>I timidly asked:</t4630>
<t4631>- What's going on?</t4631>
<t4632>The king looked at me annoyed and said:</t4632>
<t4633>- None of your business!</t4633> <t4634>Don't stick your nose into other people's affairs.</t4634> <t4635>As long as you're in this town, you better keep your mouth shut, got it?</t4635>
<t4636>Then the old man turned around and said to the duke:</t4636>
<t4637>- Let's not have anything, just stay silent.</t4637>
<t4638>They walked down the stairs, the duke still whispering:</t4638>
<t4639>- Sell quickly, even if the profit is small.</t4639> <t4640>Quickly have the money in hand.</t4640>
<t4641>The king grinned, looking at the duke and said:</t4641>
<t4642>- I'm planning to try to sell everything quickly for the maximum profit.</t4642> <t4643>If it doesn't make much, or doesn't make anything at all, then is that my fault or yours?</t4643>
<t4644>- If you had listened to me, the blacks would still be in the house and we would have already escaped with the big bag of money.</t4644>
<t4645>The king, afraid of the secret getting out, ran over to me to threaten me not to tell anyone about seeing the black man coming out of the old man's room, because if I did, everyone would immediately know something was up.</t4645> <t4646>Then the old man staggered back to his room, cursing himself for a while and saying that it was all his fault for not staying in his room longer like every morning, and swore that from then on he wouldn't be so foolish.</t4646> <t4647>Then they went on to discuss something else with each other.</t4647> <t4648>As for me, I was secretly glad that I had exonerated the black men without causing them any harm.</t4648>
<t4649>Chapter XXXVIII</t4649>
<t4650>Jim said that engraving letters was the hardest of all.</t4650> <t4651>But Tom insisted that Jim must write.</t4651> <t4652>The prisoner had to leave his handwriting on the wall for posterity, along with his emblem.</t4652>
<t4653>Jim said:</t4653>
<t4654>- Uncle Tom, I don't have any personal badge at all, I only have this shirt you gave me and I have to write my diary on it.</t4654>
<t4655>- You don't understand anything, Jim, the badge is different, it's not like that.</t4655>
<t4656>I said:</t4656>
<t4657>- Jim is right.</t4657> <t4658>He doesn't have any badges.</t4658>
<t4659>Tom replied:</t4659>
<t4660>- I know, but Jim needs to have a badge before leaving this place.</t4660>
<t4661>So Tom sat down, racking his brain to come up with a badge for Jim. After a while, he said he had thought of many but didn't know which one to choose.</t4661> <t4662>Finally, he picked a design and said:</t4662>
<t4663>- On that coat of arms, a circle is drawn around it, in front is a yellow cross, with a dog lying down, showing subservience, under the dog's feet is a chain, then there is a place to record achievements in green, with serrated edges, a green letter V at the top of the coat of arms, three slanted lines on a blue background with many dots.</t4663> <t4664>A symbol of a black man running away carrying a bundle of luggage, and another symbol of two guys following to help, that is, you and me.</t4664>
<t4665>So it resolved the matter of the badge, now it just had to finish the remaining part, which was to draft a farewell letter, saying that Jim must have such a letter, as it was mentioned in the book.</t4665> <t4666>It wrote it down on a piece of paper, then read it aloud:</t4666>
<t4667>1) Here, a captive heart is breaking.</t4667>
<t4668>2) Here, a pitiable prisoner, abandoned by life and friends, must live withering and decaying.</t4668>
<t4669>3) Here, a lonely heart is broken, a spirit has grown weary after thirty-seven years of solitary confinement.</t4669>
<t4670>4) Here, the child of Louis the Fourteenth died homeless, without close friends, after thirty-seven years of imprisonment.</t4670>
<t4671>When reading those sentences, Tom's voice trembled with emotion.</t4671> <t4672>After finishing reading, he didn't know which sentence to choose for Jim to write on the wall because they all seemed good; in the end, he decided to let Jim write all of them.</t4672> <t4673>Jim said it would take him a year to finish writing all those words, so Tom would write them outside, and Jim would just trace them on the wall.</t4673> <t4674>Then he said:</t4674>
<t4675>- Writing on wood won't work, because there are no wooden walls in the tower prison.</t4675> <t4676>We have to carve the letters into the stone instead.</t4676>
<t4677>Jim said that carving on stone is even harder than on wood, so it would take him a long time to finish and escape.</t4677> <t4678>But Tom said he would let me help.</t4678> <t4679>Then he looked to see how far Jim and I had written.</t4679> <t4680>Doing this was really a very difficult and slow task; my hands, already sore, hurt even more, and the work seemed to make no progress at all.</t4680> <t4681>Tom said:</t4681>
<t4682>- I have an idea.</t4682> <t4683>We need to find a stone to make a badge and write on it. There is a very large grinding stone in the workshop, we will bring it up here and write things on it, and we can also use it to sharpen pens and saws.</t4683>
<t4684>It was a bizarre idea, but we thought we could do it.</t4684> <t4685>It was not yet midnight, we went outside and headed down to the workshop, leaving only Jim to do his work.</t4685> <t4686>We carried the stone outside and rolled it home, but it was so heavy that several times it almost crushed our feet.</t4686> <t4687>Tom said that someone would definitely get their foot crushed by the stone before we could carry it all the way back.</t4687> <t4688>Halfway there, we were exhausted, staggering, and drenched in sweat.</t4688> <t4689>We had to call Jim, Jim got up and unhooked the chain from the bedpost, crawled out through the hole to where the stone was, and Jim and I lifted the stone, walking as if it was nothing, while Tom commanded.</t4689> <t4690>He could command any other child.</t4690> <t4691>He could do all sorts of things.</t4691>
<t4692>The hole we dug was quite large, but the rock still couldn't fit through, so Jim took the pickaxe and dug it wider.</t4692> <t4693>Tom took a nail and marked the rock, telling Jim to chisel along the marks.</t4693> <t4694>He told Jim to keep working until the candle went out, then hide the rock under the bed and sleep on top of it.</t4694> <t4695>We helped Jim reattach the chain to the bed leg, then we also got ready to sleep.</t4695> <t4696>But suddenly, Tom said:</t4696>
<t4697>- Is there any spider in here, Jim?</t4697>
<t4698>- No, there isn't, my friend.</t4698>
<t4699>- Okay, let me go get some for you.</t4699>
<t4700>- Oh, I'm very scared.</t4700> <t4701>I'd rather have snakes than spiders.</t4701>
<t4702>Tom thought for a few minutes and then said:</t4702>
<t4703>- That's a good idea.</t4703> <t4704>So where did you put it?</t4704>
<t4705>- Leave what, Tom?</t4705>
<t4706>- A snake, what else?</t4706>
<t4707>- Oh my God, if a snake crawls in here, I will immediately have to squeeze through that hole in the wall to escape.</t4707>
<t4708>- Oh, Jim, don't be so scared.</t4708> <t4709>Can you conquer it?</t4709>
<t4710>- Conquer?</t4710>
<t4711>- Yes, it's easy.</t4711> <t4712>Any animal that you love will be grateful and will never harm you.</t4712> <t4713>Just give it a try.</t4713> <t4714>Then it might let you wrap it around your neck and even nuzzle its head into your mouth.</t4714>
<t4715>- I beg you, I don't dare to listen! Will it let me put its head in my mouth?</t4715> <t4716>Never.</t4716> <t4717>Moreover, I don't want it to sleep with me.</t4717>
<t4718>- Jim, don't be so foolish.</t4718> <t4719>A prisoner must have an animal to keep him company.</t4719> <t4720>Until now, no one has ever kept a snake, so if you are the first to do it, it will be even more glorious.</t4720>
<t4721>- Tom, I don't want that glory.</t4721> <t4722>The snake will bite me.</t4722> <t4723>No, I don't want to do that.</t4723>
<t4724>- Damn it, can't you just try? I just want you to try.</t4724> <t4725>If you don't like it, you don't have to keep it forever!</t4725>
<t4726>- But while I was trying, it bit me already.</t4726> <t4727>Tom, I don't want to do those things.</t4727> <t4728>If Huck brings a snake in here, I'll leave immediately, for sure.</t4728>
<t4729>- Well, never mind then.</t4729> <t4730>We'll find you a few non-venomous snakes instead.</t4730>
<t4731>- I can't stand it either, Tom.</t4731> <t4732>I'm telling you the truth, I've never felt so worried and miserable like this.</t4732>
<t4733>- So, are there any mice here?</t4733>
<t4734>- No, I didn't see any.</t4734>
<t4735>- Well, we will find you some mice...</t4735>
<t4736>- I don't need mice, Tom.</t4736> <t4737>They are the most annoying creatures, always bothering people, climbing on them, biting their feet, and preventing them from sleeping.</t4737> <t4738>I'd rather you put in regular snakes than bring mice in here.</t4738> <t4739>I have no use for mice.</t4739>
<t4740>- But you must have a mouse.</t4740> <t4741>Don't worry, they all do it that way.</t4741> <t4742>Prisoners never have mice, they train them with many tricks, and then those mice become as familiar as flies.</t4742> <t4743>And you also have to play music for them. Do you have anything to play music?</t4743>
<t4744>- I only have a broken comb and a piece of paper to make a plucked instrument.</t4744> <t4745>But I'm sure they don't like plucked instruments.</t4745>
<t4746>- Yes, they do. They don't discriminate against any kind of music.</t4746> <t4747>Plucking the instrument is already good enough for the mice.</t4747> <t4748>All animals like music, and in prison, they like it even more, especially sad music.</t4748> <t4749>The mice love it.</t4749> <t4750>They will come out to see what strange thing you have.</t4750> <t4751>At night, before going to sleep and early in the morning when you wake up, you have to sit on the bed for a while and play that plucking instrument.</t4751> <t4752>If you play for about two minutes, you will see all kinds of mice, snakes, spiders, etc., feeling sad for you and gathering around you.</t4752>
<t4753>-Yes, I think so too.</t4753> <t4754>But right now I don't understand anything, I will try to follow if I have to do it.</t4754> <t4755>I will make those animals satisfied and there will be no trouble in the house.</t4755>
<t4756>Tom thought for a moment longer to see if there was anything else, then he said:</t4756>
<t4757>- There's one more thing I forgot.</t4757> <t4758>Can you leave the flowers here?</t4758>
<t4759>- I don't know, but maybe.</t4759> <t4760>But it's very dark in here, and I don't need flowers, it just adds more trouble.</t4760>
<t4761>- You should give it a try.</t4761> <t4762>The other prisoners also grow flowers.</t4762>
<t4763>- it seems that you can grow cattail flowers here, but it's not worth the effort to plant them.</t4763>
<t4764>- Don't think that way.</t4764> <t4765>We will find you a sapling, and you will plant it in that corner of the house over there.</t4765> <t4766>Don't call it a cat's tail flower, you must call it Pitchiola.</t4766> <t4767>And you must water it with your tears.</t4767>
<t4768>- What's wrong? I have plenty of rainwater here.</t4768>
<t4769>- You cannot water it with rain; you must water it with tears.</t4769> <t4770>Everyone does it that way.</t4770>
<t4771>- Uncle Tom, then that flower will surely die, because I rarely cry.</t4771>
<t4772>Tom was at a loss for words.</t4772> <t4773>But after thinking for a while, he told Jim to rub an onion on his eyes to make tears.</t4773> <t4774>He promised to pick an onion and secretly put it in Jim's coffee pot in the morning. Jim said that would make the coffee smell like onions, and then Jim complained about Tom's plans, such as planting cattail flowers, playing music for the mice, petting snakes and spiders, and also having to sharpen pencils, carve letters into stone, and write a diary, etc. It was really troublesome and annoying.</t4774> <t4775>He talked for a while, making Tom discouraged. Tom said that he had thought of all those things just to make Jim famous, but Jim's complaints made it all seem in vain.</t4775> <t4776>Hearing that, Jim felt remorseful and promised not to behave like that anymore.</t4776> <t4777>After that, Tom and I went back to our room to sleep.</t4777>
<t4778>Chapter XXIX</t4778>
<t4779>They approached an old man who looked very polite along with a younger man, who also looked quite mature, with a bandage on his right arm.</t4779> <t4780>It seemed like this matter was not a joke.</t4780> <t4781>Perhaps the king and the duke were also feeling uneasy.</t4781> <t4782>I'm sure they would be scared pale.</t4782> <t4783>But no, they didn't show any signs of it.</t4783> <t4784>The duke still calmly wandered around there, looking satisfied.</t4784> <t4785>And the king looked up and down, appearing hesitant and worried; it seemed that it pained him to think that there could be such deceitful swindlers in the world.</t4785> <t4786>Many people stood around the king to support him.</t4786> <t4787>A moment later, the dignified old man began to speak.</t4787> <t4788>I immediately noticed that he spoke exactly like a real Englishman, unlike the king's manner of speaking.</t4788> <t4789>He spoke roughly like this:</t4789>
<t4790>- This is truly a strange thing that I could not have anticipated.</t4790> <t4791>My brother and I had an unfortunate incident; my brother broke his arm, and our luggage was mistakenly sent to another town.</t4791> <t4792>I am Harvey, the brother of Peter Wilks; and this is my brother William.</t4792> <t4793>William cannot hear or speak, and he can't make many signs because he has broken an arm.</t4793> <t4794>In a few days, when we retrieve our luggage, we will have enough evidence.</t4794> <t4795>But until then, I don't want to say anything more, we will go to the hotel and wait there.</t4795>
<t4796>Then the two people walked away.</t4796> <t4797>The king laughed and muttered for a while:</t4797>
<t4798>- A broken arm, yes, that's possible, isn't it, gentlemen?</t4798> <t4799>And it's convenient for a trickster who needs to make a signal.</t4799> <t4800>Losing luggage, now that's an intelligent ruse!</t4800>
<t4801>Then the old man laughed loudly, and everyone else laughed along, except for three or four people who did not agree.</t4801> <t4802>One of those people was the doctor.</t4802> <t4803>The second person was a very polite man, carrying a suitcase, who had just disembarked from the ship earlier and was speaking quietly with the doctor, occasionally looking up at the king and nodding their heads.</t4803> <t4804>That was lawyer Levi Ben, who had just returned from Louisville.</t4804> <t4805>The third person was large and muscular, who had just arrived and was listening to the old man earlier and now listening to the king.</t4805> <t4806>After the king finished speaking, that person looked up and asked:</t4806>
<t4807>- If you are Harvey Wilks, then when did you arrive in this town?</t4807>
<t4808>- The day before the funeral, sir.</t4808>
<t4809>- But at what time?</t4809>
<t4810>- In the afternoon, about one or two hours before sunset.</t4810>
<t4811>- How did you get here?</t4811>
<t4812>- I took the Susan Powell train from Cincinnati to here.</t4812>
<t4813>- So how did you manage to get to the dock in the morning, did you take a boat</t4813><t4814>?</t4814>
<t4815>- I do not go to the dock in the morning.</t4815>
<t4816>- Nonsense.</t4816>
<t4817>Many people came forward and demanded that the other person not speak in such a manner to a pastor.</t4817>
<t4818>- Pastor?</t4818> <t4819>Hang him up, he's a fraud.</t4819> <t4820>He arrived at the dock that morning.</t4820> <t4821>I was there myself and saw him.</t4821> <t4822>He went by boat, along with Tim Collins and another boy.</t4822>
<t4823>The doctor asked:</t4823>
<t4824>- If you see that boy again, would you recognize him, Hines?</t4824>
<t4825>- Recognize it? Ah, there it is.</t4825>
<t4826>That person pointed directly at me.</t4826> <t4827>The doctor said:</t4827>
<t4828>- Ladies and gentlemen, I am not yet sure if the two people who just arrived are frauds or not, but if these two guys here are not swindlers, then I am just a fool.</t4828> <t4829>I think it is our duty to keep them from leaving this place until we understand the situation.</t4829> <t4830>Everyone, follow me to the hotel and confront the two newcomers; I am sure we can find something.</t4830>
<t4831>Everyone appeared angry except for those who sided with the king.</t4831> <t4832>So, we all had to go.</t4832> <t4833>At that time, the sun was about to set.</t4833> <t4834>The doctor took my hand and led me, gently, but he didn't let go of me for a moment.</t4834> <t4835>Everyone entered a large room in the hotel, then summoned the two people from earlier.</t4835> <t4836>The doctor spoke first:</t4836>
<t4837>- I don't want to do anything excessive to these two people, but because I think they are swindlers, and they might have schemes that we don't know about.</t4837> <t4838>Would they dare to slip away and leave Peter Wilks' bundle of money behind?</t4838> <t4839>Probably not.</t4839> <t4840>If these guys aren't swindlers, they would probably take out that bundle of money for us to keep until they can prove they are honest, wouldn't everyone agree?</t4840>
<t4841>Everyone answered in agreement. I think they had cornered us right from the start.</t4841> <t4842>But the king only showed a hint of sadness.</t4842> <t4843>He said:</t4843>
<t4844>- Dear sirs, I also hope that the money pouch is still there, because I do not want to hinder the discovery of the whole story.</t4844> <t4845>But the money pouch is no longer there.</t4845> <t4846>If you don't believe me, you can send someone to search.</t4846>
<t4847>- Where did you put the money?</t4847>
<t4848>- When my granddaughter gave it to me, I hid it under the mattress of my bed, because I was staying here for a few days and didn't want to deposit that money into the bank.</t4848> <t4849>I thought black people were as honest as my servants, but who would have thought they would take all that money before leaving this place.</t4849> <t4850>My servant here can explain this clearly for you to understand.</t4850>
<t4851>The doctor, along with many others, also said:</t4851>
<t4852>- Stop it!</t4852>
<t4853>Nobody believes what that old man says.</t4853> <t4854>Someone asked me if I saw the black people stealing money.</t4854> <t4855>I said that I only saw them hurrying out of the room.</t4855> <t4856>I thought they were afraid of waking up my boss, so they had to step outside.</t4856> <t4857>But the doctor angrily asked me:</t4857>
<t4858>- Are you English?</t4858>
<t4859>I said yes, then he and everyone laughed and said:</t4859>
<t4860>- Another con artist!</t4860>
<t4861>We were being talked up and down for several hours without anyone mentioning anything about eating or drinking.</t4861> <t4862>They made the king recount the whole story of the old man, and then they asked that distinguished old man to also recount his whole story.</t4862> <t4863>But no one dared to assert whether the old man was telling the truth or the king was lying.</t4863> <t4864>After a while, they told me to step forward and recount everything I knew.</t4864> <t4865>The king glanced at me, so I knew how to speak appropriately.</t4865> <t4866>I began to talk about the city of Sheffield, how we lived there, and everything about the Wilks family in England. But before I could finish, that doctor burst out laughing, and then Levi Ben, the lawyer, also spoke:</t4866>
<t4867>- Well, the machine isn't used to lying, so it often stumbles over its words.</t4867>
<t4868>I didn't pay attention to the compliment; I was just very happy to have escaped.</t4868>
<t4869>Now, the doctor turned to the side and said:</t4869>
<t4870>- If only you had been in this town from the very beginning, wouldn't that be better, Mr. Levi Ben?</t4870>
<t4871>The king raised his hand and interjected:</t4871>
<t4872>- So this is the friend that my brother often mentioned in his letters?</t4872>
<t4873>The lawyer shook hands with the old man, smiling with satisfaction, then the two exchanged a few words, and stepped aside to speak quietly.</t4873> <t4874>A moment later, the lawyer spoke up:</t4874>
<t4875>- Alright, I will take the documents from both sides to understand the truth of the matter.</t4875>
<t4876>So they took out paper and pen.</t4876> <t4877>The king sat down, tilted his head to one side, and scribbled something on it.</t4877> <t4878>Then they handed the pen to the duke, who seemed fearful.</t4878> <t4879>But he still took the pen and wrote.</t4879> <t4880>Then the lawyer turned to the old man and said:</t4880>
<t4881>- You and your brother, please write a few lines here and sign your names below.</t4881>
<t4882>The old man wrote, but no one could read a single word.</t4882> <t4883>The lawyer took an old bundle of letters from his pocket, examined them carefully, then looked at the old man's handwriting, and then at the handwriting of the king and the duke, showing great surprise, he said:</t4883>
<t4884>- Strange, these old letters are from Harvey Wilks and here are two handwriting samples.</t4884> <t4885>Anyone can see that those people did not write like this.</t4885> <t4886>As for this old man's handwriting, anyone can easily see that it's not his writing...</t4886>
<t4887>The old man interrupted:</t4887>
<t4888>- I would like to offer an explanation.</t4888> <t4889>No one can read my handwriting, except for my younger brother.</t4889> <t4890>Therefore, my brother always transcribes the letters I write.</t4890> <t4891>The letters you are holding are all in my brother's handwriting, not mine.</t4891>
<t4892>- In that case, - the lawyer said - I also have some letters from William here.</t4892> <t4893>So if you let him write a few lines, we can... .</t4893>
<t4894>- My brother cannot write with his left hand. If my brother's right hand had not been broken, you would clearly see that both letters were written by the same person.</t4894>
<t4895>The lawyer looked at it and said:</t4895>
<t4896>- I think it's probably true, I see the two handwritings are very similar.</t4896> <t4897>Alright! I think we are about to reach a resolution, but some parts are still unclear.</t4897> <t4898>Anyway, there is one thing that can prove these two are not the Wilks brothers.</t4898>
<t4899>As he spoke, he turned towards the king and the duke.</t4899>
<t4900>At this point, the old man still wouldn't admit defeat.</t4900> <t4901>He said that William was a stubborn and playful person, that when he put pen to paper it was just one of his pranks.</t4901> <t4902>Then the old man rambled on for a while until he thought he was actually talking about himself.</t4902> <t4903>But the other old man interrupted:</t4903>
<t4904>- I have an idea, is there anyone here who helped with the shrouding of Mr. Peter Wilks before his burial?</t4904>
<t4905>There was a voice speaking:</t4905>
<t4906>- What! Ab Turner and I did that.</t4906> <t4907>Both of us went there.</t4907>
<t4908>Then the old man turned to ask the king:</t4908>
<t4909>- Could you tell me what tattoo Peter has on his chest?</t4909>
<t4910>This time, it's really dangerous.</t4910> <t4911>If he doesn't answer quickly, there will be no way to escape.</t4911> <t4912>How could he know what tattoo was on the chest of the deceased?</t4912> <t4913>He turned pale for a moment, and everyone seemed to lean forward a bit, staring intently at him.</t4913> <t4914>He still wouldn't give in, determined to go all the way to prevent everyone from catching him off guard and escaping.</t4914> <t4915>He still sat there confidently, and after a while, he smiled and answered:</t4915>
<t4916>- That is indeed a difficult question to answer.</t4916> <t4917>Yes, sir, I can tell you what tattoo was on the chest of the deceased.</t4917> <t4918>It was just a very small, blue arrow, which could not be seen unless looked at very closely.</t4918> <t4919>So, what do you think?</t4919>
<t4920>I've never seen anyone as brazen as him.</t4920>
<t4921>The old man immediately turned towards Ab Turner and Ab Turner's friend, his eyes lighting up because he thought to himself that this time he had caught the king.</t4921> <t4922>The old man asked:</t4922>
<t4923>- There, you all heard what that man just said! So, does Peter Wilks have such a tattoo on his chest?</t4923>
<t4924>Both of them answered together:</t4924>
<t4925>- We did not see any such signs</t4925>
<t4926>- Very good, - The old man continued - On Peter's chest, do you see a few small letters P and B with the letter W, with dashes between the three letters, like this P - B - W?</t4926>
<t4927>The two men said again:</t4927>
<t4928>- No, we didn't see anything.</t4928> <t4929>There were no signs at all.</t4929>
<t4930>At that moment, everyone was confused, then they screamed:</t4930>
<t4931>- They're all just a bunch of swindlers! Throw them all into the river!</t4931>
<t4932>But the lawyer jumped onto the table and shouted loudly:</t4932>
<t4933>- Everyone, please listen to me, just one sentence, only one sentence.</t4933> <t4934>There is only one way left, let's go dig up the corpse and see.</t4934>
<t4935>Everyone agreed, wanting to leave immediately, but the lawyer and the doctor spoke loudly:</t4935>
<t4936>- Wait a minute! Grab all four people and this guy carrying the baby and take them away.</t4936>
<t4937>Everyone shouted:</t4937>
<t4938>- Alright, and if we don't see those tattoos, we'll hang the whole bunch of you.</t4938>
<t4939>I was so scared, I couldn't escape anymore.</t4939> <t4940>They grabbed us tightly and led us straight to the cemetery about a mile down by the river.</t4940> <t4941>The whole town followed behind, making a lot of noise.</t4941> <t4942>It was only nine o'clock in the evening then.</t4942>
<t4943>When passing by the house, I thought if only I hadn't told Miss Mary Jane to go to the suburbs, she would have come to rescue me and expose those scoundrels by now.</t4943>
<t4944>The whole group followed the riverbank like wild cats.</t4944> <t4945>The sky darkened, the wind rustled the leaves, making me extremely frightened.</t4945>
<t4946>What if they don't find the tattoo?</t4946> <t4947>Thinking about the imminent death, I couldn't bear it.</t4947> <t4948>The sky was getting darker, making it very convenient to escape, but Hines held my wrist tightly.</t4948> <t4949>He was angry, dragging me along roughly, I had to walk faster to avoid being pulled by him.</t4949>
<t4950>The crowd of people swarmed to the cemetery like ants, carrying hundreds of shovels, but no one thought to bring a light.</t4950> <t4951>However, they kept digging by the distant glimmering lights, while one person ran to the nearest house about half a mile from the cemetery to borrow a lamp.</t4951>
<t4952>They kept digging.</t4952> <t4953>The sky was pitch black, the wind howled, lightning flashed continuously, and thunder roared; but they paid no attention to any of it.</t4953> <t4954>They were engrossed in digging, sometimes the lightning lasted for a very bright minute, allowing everything and everyone in the crowd to be seen, even the shovels full of earth being thrown up from the grave.</t4954> <t4955>Then after a while, the sky turned pitch black again, and nothing could be seen.</t4955>
<t4956>Finally, they managed to lift the coffin and pry out the nails sealing the lid.</t4956> <t4957>Everyone tried to jostle each other to get a look inside.</t4957> <t4958>It was horrifying; Hines kept gripping my wrist and pulling me along.</t4958> <t4959>I thought he would forget about me there, as he was also intently watching.</t4959>
<t4960>Suddenly, a flash of lightning lit up the entire area, and there was a shout.</t4960>
<t4961>- Oh Lord, the money pouch is lying on the chest of this dead person!</t4961>
<t4962>Hines screamed like everyone else, suddenly grabbed my wrist and pushed quickly, squeezing into the crowd to see; I took the opportunity to slip out, ran to the street without anyone noticing.</t4962>
<t4963>I ran like the wind on the road.</t4963> <t4964>At least, I felt like it was just me and the darkness, with occasional flashes of lightning, the sound of pouring rain, the howling wind, and the rumbling thunder.</t4964>
<t4965>Upon arriving at the town, I didn't see a single soul, so I confidently walked down the middle of the main street.</t4965> <t4966>As I got closer to home, I kept an eye out to see if I noticed anything.</t4966> <t4967>There were no lights at all, the house was pitch dark, and I felt disheartened and disappointed, not understanding why.</t4967> <t4968>But then, just as I passed the house, I saw a flash of light at Mary Jane's room door.</t4968> <t4969>My heart felt like it was going to burst.</t4969> <t4970>Right after that moment, the house returned to complete darkness behind me, and I saw nothing more.</t4970> <t4971>I thought she was truly the most resilient girl I had ever met.</t4971>
<t4972>When I had gone quite far out of town, I carefully looked to see if there was a small boat I could borrow temporarily.</t4972> <t4973>Just then, lightning flashed, and I saw a boat not chained but only tied with a rope.</t4973> <t4974>I immediately jumped down and hurriedly rowed away.</t4974>
<t4975>Reaching the raft, I was already exhausted, just wanting to lie down and catch my breath for a moment.</t4975> <t4976>But as soon as I climbed up, I called out:</t4976>
<t4977>- Jim, come here, let's set the raft off right away!</t4977> <t4978>We're so lucky, we've escaped from them.</t4978>
<t4979>Jim came out, spreading his arms wide to hug me.</t4979> <t4980>He was extremely happy, but when there was a flash of light, I suddenly fell silent, looked at him, and stepped back.</t4980> <t4981>I had forgotten that he was pretending to be the dead Arab.</t4981> <t4982>But Jim didn't care, he just hugged me tightly, happy for me.</t4982> <t4983>He was overjoyed to see that I had returned and escaped from the two swindlers.</t4983> <t4984>But I said:</t4984>
<t4985>- Let's talk later! Untie the raft and let's go!</t4985>
<t4986>So, just two seconds later, we were drifting down the river, feeling happy to be free again, alone on the big river, without anyone disturbing us anymore!</t4986>
<t4987>I had to jump up a few times and click my heels for a bit because I couldn't see.</t4987> <t4988>But when I clicked my heels for the third time, I heard a familiar sound.</t4988> <t4989>I held my breath, listened, and waited to see.</t4989> <t4990>Just as a flash of lightning lit up the water, I saw them sitting with oars in hand, pushing the boat forward.</t4990> <t4991>It was the king with the duke.</t4991>
<t4992>I collapsed onto the raft.</t4992> <t4993>I did so just to keep myself from bursting into tears.</t4993>
<t4994>Chapter XXX</t4994>
<t4995>As soon as he got onto the raft, the king immediately came to me, grabbed my collar, and asked:</t4995>
<t4996>- Are you planning to abandon us, child?</t4996> <t4997>Are you tired of us already?</t4997>
<t4998>I replied:</t4998>
<t4999>- Yes, sir, no.</t4999> <t5000>I beg you, sir</t5000>
<t5001>- So, what are you planning to do?</t5001> <t5002>Speak quickly, or I'll skin you right now.</t5002>
<t5003>- I will tell you everything that happened.</t5003> <t5004>The man who held my hand, he was very kind, saying that he also had a child as old as me who died last year, so when he saw me in danger, he felt compassion.</t5004> <t5005>When everyone was clamoring because they saw the money bundle in the coffin, he let go of my hand and whispered: "Run, or they'll hang you."</t5005> <t5006>So I ran.</t5006> <t5007>I couldn't do anything else.</t5007> <t5008>I just kept running until I found the boat, then went to the raft and told Jim to get away quickly or they'd catch me and hang me.</t5008> <t5009>I kept worrying about you and the duke, and so did Jim.</t5009> <t5010>Ask Jim if it's true.</t5010>
<t5011>Jim also said the same thing. The king shouted at Jim and then grabbed my neck, threatening to drown me in the river.</t5011> <t5012>But the duke intervened.</t5012>
<t5013>- Let the boy go! I ask you, when you escaped, did you think about him?</t5013> <t5014>Probably not.</t5014>
<t5015>The king released me, then cursed the town and everyone in it.</t5015> <t5016>But the duke said:</t5016>
<t5017>- You should curse yourself instead, because you are the one most deserving of curses.</t5017> <t5018>From beginning to end, you haven't accomplished anything worthwhile, except for calmly thinking of the green arrow on the chest of the dead person.</t5018> <t5019>If not, they would have detained us, waiting for the Englishmen's luggage to arrive, and then we would be in jail! After that, the bundle of money saved us once again.</t5019> <t5020>If those madmen hadn't stormed off, tonight you and I would be tying our ties and sleeping forever.</t5020>
<t5021>They were silent for a moment, then the king said absentmindedly:</t5021>
<t5022>- And yet, I mistakenly thought that the black people were stealing.</t5022>
<t5023>I was startled.</t5023>
<t5024>The Duke said bitterly:</t5024>
<t5025>- Yes, I thought so too.</t5025>
<t5026>About half a minute later, the king spoke again:</t5026>
<t5027>- at least, that's what I think.</t5027>
<t5028>The Duke spoke, in the same tone as the king:</t5028>
<t5029>- I thought so too.</t5029>
<t5030>The king seemed to snap:</t5030>
<t5031>- Hey, Bilgewater, what do you think that means?</t5031>
<t5032>The Duke replied irritably:</t5032>
<t5033>- So what are you trying to say?</t5033>
<t5034>The king sarcastically said:</t5034>
<t5035>- Perhaps at that moment you were still drowsy and didn't know what you were supposed to be doing.</t5035>
<t5036>The Duke jumped up:</t5036>
<t5037>- Oh, do you think I'm crazy?</t5037> <t5038>Do you think I don't know who hid the money in that coffin?</t5038>
<t5039>- Of course you know because you hid it there yourself</t5039>
<t5040>- Nonsense!</t5040>
<t5041>The Duke charged forward.</t5041> <t5042>The King cried out:</t5042>
<t5043>- Let go of me! Don't choke me like that.</t5043> <t5044>I can't speak anymore.</t5044>
<t5045>The Duke said:</t5045>
<t5046>- It was you who kept the money, then you yourself buried it there, planning to dig it up alone when the opportunity arose.</t5046>
<t5047>- Wait, Duke, please answer me this question honestly.</t5047> <t5048>If you hid the money there, just say so, I will believe you and forget everything that happened until now.</t5048>
<t5049>- Old man, I'm not hiding, there's no way I would do that.</t5049>
<t5050>- Alright, I believe you.</t5050> <t5051>But answer me one more question, deep down, did you ever think about taking the money and the papers away?</t5051>
<t5052>The duke said nothing, and only after a while did he respond:</t5052>
<t5053>- If you think that way, it's okay.</t5053> <t5054>As for you, not only do you think that way, but you also act that way.</t5054>
<t5055>- I swear, if I do that, I will die immediately.</t5055> <t5056>I did think about it, but you or someone else already did it before me.</t5056>
<t5057>- Hmph, it was you who stole, you must confess.</t5057>
<t5058>The king stammered and then sighed:</t5058>
<t5059>- Yes, then I'll take it.</t5059>
<t5060>I was overjoyed when I heard the king say that. The duke let go of the old man and said:</t5060>
<t5061>- If you keep denying it, I'll drown you.</t5061> <t5062>Now, you're still sitting there crying like a child!</t5062> <t5063>I've never met an old man as greedy as you.</t5063> <t5064>Yet, I always trusted you like my own father.</t5064> <t5065>You should be ashamed when you see innocent black people being blamed. Honestly, I was foolish to believe in those tricks.</t5065> <t5066>Now I understand that you made up the story about missing money so that I would give up the money I earned from the play, and you could take it all.</t5066>
<t5067>The king sniffled and replied:</t5067>
<t5068>- It was you who came up with that idea of covering the cost, not me.</t5068>
<t5069>- Shut up.</t5069> <t5070>I don't want to hear you talk anymore!</t5070> <t5071>Now you see the result.</t5071> <t5072>They have gotten back all their money and even more from us.</t5072> <t5073>Now go to sleep.</t5073> <t5074>As long as you are alive, don't do anything that harms my money anymore!</t5074>
<t5075>So the king crawled into the tent, grabbed a bottle of wine, and took a swig. Then the duke also grabbed another bottle.</t5075> <t5076>About half an hour later, the two scoundrels were friendly with each other again as usual, hugging each other to sleep, snoring loudly.</t5076> <t5077>Both of them calmed down, but I noticed that the king wasn't quite at ease yet about not being able to deny hiding the bundle of money.</t5077> <t5078>That made me very pleased.</t5078>
<t5079>We waited until they were snoring loudly, then we sat down and talked to each other, and I recounted the entire story to Jim.</t5079>
<t5080>Chapter XXXI</t5080>
<t5081>For many days after that, we didn't dare stop in any town, but kept going straight ahead.</t5081> <t5082>We headed south, where the climate was warm and it was also quite far from home.</t5082> <t5083>The trees were dense, with vines hanging from large branches, looking like long gray nets.</t5083> <t5084>It was the first time I saw those trees, and it seemed to make the forest even more solemn and sorrowful.</t5084> <t5085>By this point, the two swindlers thought the danger was over, so they went into the villages to scavenge again.</t5085>
<t5086>At first, they talked about alcohol addiction, but they couldn't even make enough money to buy alcohol for themselves to drink.</t5086> <t5087>When they reached another village, they opened a dance class, but they only danced like kangaroos, so the public just joined in and chased them away immediately.</t5087> <t5088>Another time, they tried to give a speech, but after just a few sentences, the audience stood up and cursed them out, then kicked them out.</t5088> <t5089>They also tried preaching, hypnosis, healing, and fortune-telling, each a little bit, but it seemed like all these attempts were unlucky.</t5089> <t5090>In the end, they were so bored that they lay on the raft for half a day without saying a word, looking very sad and disappointed.</t5090>
<t5091>In the end, they huddled together and discussed something for two or three hours, looking very secretive.</t5091> <t5092>Jim and I were worried, surely they were plotting something nefarious again.</t5092> <t5093>After thinking for a while, we guessed that they were planning to break into a house or a shop, or perhaps they were about to counterfeit money.</t5093> <t5094>So we got really scared and agreed that we would definitely not get involved in their actions, and if possible, we would run away immediately.</t5094>
<t5095>One early morning, we hid the raft in a safe place, two miles away from a shabby village named Pikesville.</t5095> <t5096>The Duke went ashore, instructing us to hide and wait for him to go to town to see if there was any gossip about the Royal Nonesuch performance.</t5096> <t5097>He said that if he didn't return by noon, the Duke and I would follow him.</t5097>
<t5098>The duke seemed restless and irritable.</t5098> <t5099>He scolded us over the smallest things.</t5099> <t5100>Surely something is about to happen.</t5100> <t5101>I was very glad that by noon the king had not returned.</t5101> <t5102>So, the duke and I went ashore and into the village to find the king.</t5102> <t5103>A while later, we saw him behind a fishing boat, being pushed into a cramped house, and being taunted by a gang of ruffians...</t5103> <t5104>He was cursing loudly and threatening those people.</t5104> <t5105>When the duke arrived and saw this, he said that it was just a crazy old man.</t5105> <t5106>The king scolded the duke back.</t5106> <t5107>Taking advantage of their fierce argument, I slipped away, running like the wind down the riverside road.</t5107> <t5108>I ran to the hidden raft, out of breath, but feeling very happy inside.</t5108> <t5109>I called out:</t5109>
<t5110>- Jim, let's release the raft, we're free now.</t5110>
<t5111>But there was no answer, and no one came out of the tent.</t5111> <t5112>Jim was gone!</t5112> <t5113>I called out loudly once, then again - and again; ran in all directions into the forest, howling, shouting, but it was useless - Jim was lost.</t5113> <t5114>I sat down and sobbed uncontrollably.</t5114> <t5115>After a while, I returned to the main road, thinking about what to do next.</t5115> <t5116>Suddenly, I saw a boy coming from somewhere, and I asked if he had seen a black man dressed like that.</t5116> <t5117>He replied:</t5117>
<t5118>- Yes</t5118>
<t5119>- So where is he?</t5119> <t5120>I asked:</t5120>
<t5121>- At Mr. Silas Phelps' house, two miles from here.</t5121> <t5122>He is a runaway black man; they caught him.</t5122> <t5123>Are you looking for him?</t5123>
<t5124>- No, I didn't find it.</t5124> <t5125>I met it in the forest two hours ago.</t5125> <t5126>It said if I made a sound, it would cut open my stomach, take out my liver, and make me lie down and stay still there.</t5126> <t5127>I had to lie down.</t5127> <t5128>Since then, I've been in the forest, too scared to come out.</t5128>
<t5129>The boy said:</t5129>
<t5130>- Well, now you don't have to be afraid anymore, they have already caught it.</t5130> <t5131>It seems like it ran towards the South.</t5131>
<t5132>- It's fortunate that it has been caught.</t5132>
<t5133>- Getting a two hundred dollar reward, that's pretty sweet.</t5133>
<t5134>- Oh right, if I were a bit older, it wouldn't have escaped me because I was the one who met it first.</t5134> <t5135>So who caught it?</t5135>
<t5136>- An old man, then he sold it to another person for forty dollars because he had to leave immediately with his friend, so he couldn't wait.</t5136> <t5137>Isn't that strange?</t5137> <t5138>As for me, I would wait, even for seven years.</t5138>
<t5139>- Me too.</t5139> <t5140>But maybe he has some unclear issues, so he sold it cheaply like that.</t5140>
<t5141>- Oh, what's unclear about this matter?</t5141> <t5142>I saw the wanted poster with my own eyes, it even had its picture, saying it escaped from some plantation, seems like it was down in New Orleans.</t5142> <t5143>Hey, do you have a cigarette? Can I have one?</t5143>
<t5144>I said there wasn't any.</t5144> <t5145>So he left.</t5145> <t5146>I went back to the raft, sat in the tent, and pondered.</t5146> <t5147>I thought so hard that my head hurt, but I still couldn't find a way to get out of this troublesome boat.</t5147> <t5148>After a long and arduous journey, after so many hardships with those swindlers, now it seemed like we were getting nowhere.</t5148> <t5149>They were willing to play such a trick on Jim for just forty dollars and make him a slave again; being a slave near his home would be a thousand times better than in a strange place.</t5149> <t5150>So, I decided to write a letter to Tom Sawyer to tell him to inform Miss Watson where Jim was.</t5150> <t5151>But after thinking it over carefully, I abandoned that idea immediately.</t5151> <t5152>For two reasons: she would surely be disgusted with the ungrateful black man who left her, and she would sell him right away.</t5152> <t5153>And if she didn't do that, then Jim would always feel miserable and despicable.</t5153> <t5154>What to do now?</t5154> <t5155>Then there was the rumor that Huck Finn had helped a black man escape.</t5155> <t5156>If I met anyone in town, would I have to kneel down and shamefully lick their shoes?</t5156> <t5157>That's life: whoever does something wicked doesn't want to face the consequences of it.</t5157> <t5158>The more I thought about it, the more my conscience gnawed at me, and the more I felt despicable and lowly.</t5158> <t5159>Finally, I felt as if the hand of God had just slapped me in the face, telling me that God was still watching all my sinful deeds.</t5159> <t5160>I had stolen a black slave from a poor woman who had never done anything to harm me.</t5160> <t5161>I felt my guilt and was terribly afraid.</t5161> <t5162>I tried to console myself by thinking that I was born wicked, so it wasn't entirely my fault.</t5162> <t5163>But inside me, something still said: There's that seminary, you have to go there to learn, and if you do, they will teach you that those who do what you did to that black man will be burned to death.</t5163>
<t5164>I shuddered in fear, and I thought I must pray to become an honest person.</t5164> <t5165>I knelt down.</t5165> <t5166>But I couldn't think of any words. Why is that? Perhaps it's because one cannot lie to God or oneself.</t5166> <t5167>I knew why I couldn't find the words for a prayer, simply because I wasn't being straightforward or sincere.</t5167> <t5168>I intended to abandon my sins, but my conscience was still burdened with them...</t5168> <t5169>God knows everything, so don't pray for deceitful things.</t5169> <t5170>I understood that.</t5170>
<t5171>I was extremely worried.</t5171> <t5172>A moment later, I came up with an idea and told myself: I will write a letter to see, and then pray to see if it works.</t5172> <t5173>Strangely, as soon as I thought of that, I felt as light as a feather.</t5173> <t5174>All my worries disappeared completely.</t5174> <t5175>I grabbed a pencil and a piece of paper, eagerly sat down to write.</t5175>
<t5176>“Miss Watson, your black man Jim ran away down here, two miles from Pikesville.</t5176> <t5177>Mr. Phelps caught him and will return him to you for a reward if you send the money down.</t5177><t5178>”</t5178>
<t5179>Huck Finn</t5179>
<t5180>I felt relieved as if I had just shed all my sins.</t5180> <t5181>And I thought now I could pray.</t5181> <t5182>But I didn't pray immediately; instead, I put the piece of paper down and sat thinking.</t5182> <t5183>Everything had gone well just when I was most desperate.</t5183> <t5184>I thought again about the journey with Jim along this river.</t5184> <t5185>Jim was always by my side, day and night, under the moon as well as in the storm.</t5185> <t5186>We talked, laughed, and sang on the raft drifting along the water.</t5186> <t5187>I couldn't find a single thing that made me hate Jim; on the contrary.</t5187> <t5188>Jim stood guard for me, and instead of waking me up, he let me sleep; Jim was happy and joyful when he saw me return safely; and Jim always called me by a dear name, indulged me, and would do anything for me.</t5188> <t5189>Then I remembered when I saved Jim and told the others that there was someone with smallpox on the raft, and Jim told me I was his best friend in the world.</t5189> <t5190>Thinking that, I looked down at the piece of paper I had just written.</t5190>
<t5191>What a dilemma.</t5191> <t5192>I picked up the piece of paper, fiddling with it in my hand.</t5192> <t5193>My body trembled because this was the moment I had to decide to follow one of two choices.</t5193> <t5194>I thought for a minute, held my breath, then told myself:</t5194>
<t5195>- Alright, I'm ready to go to hell.</t5195>
<t5196>So I tore the piece of paper to shreds.</t5196>
<t5197>I chased away everything in my mind, and said that I would follow the wicked path because I was born that way, and could not be otherwise.</t5197> <t5198>I had to take action to rescue Jim from a life of slavery.</t5198> <t5199>If I could think of anything more wicked, I would do it too.</t5199>
<t5200>I thought about the action plan.</t5200> <t5201>After much deliberation, I decided to choose the plan that I found most suitable.</t5201> <t5202>I pushed the raft towards an island with many trees down the river, waited until it got dark, then hid the child in a place and returned to the tent.</t5202> <t5203>I slept there all night, waking up before dawn.</t5203> <t5204>I had a light meal, put on my clothes, and stepped into the boat to row to the shore.</t5204> <t5205>I docked the boat at a spot I guessed was the Phelps' house, hid the bundle of clothes at the edge of the forest, then let water flood the boat, put stones in it to sink it so that I could find it later if needed.</t5205> <t5206>Then I walked up the road.</t5206> <t5207>Passing by the workshop, I saw a sign that read: Phelps' Workshop.</t5207> <t5208>I walked to a few houses a few hundred yards away, peering inside but not seeing anyone, even though it was already quite bright.</t5208> <t5209>But it didn't matter because I didn't want to meet anyone yet, I just wanted to scout out the place.</t5209> <t5210>According to the plan, I pretended to be someone coming from the town, not from downstream.</t5210> <t5211>The first person I met turned out to be the duke.</t5211> <t5212>He was posting an advertisement for the play "The Royal Nonesuch."</t5212> <t5213>They still knew no fear.</t5213> <t5214>I hadn't managed to avoid him before he saw me.</t5214> <t5215>He looked surprised and called out:</t5215>
<t5216>- So you're here? Where did you put the raft?</t5216> <t5217>Did you hide it in a safe place?</t5217>
<t5218>I replied:</t5218>
<t5219>- I was also about to ask the duke that question.</t5219>
<t5220>He seemed unhappy and said:</t5220>
<t5221>- What do you mean by asking me that question?</t5221>
<t5222>I said:</t5222>
<t5223>- Yesterday, when I saw the king in that house, I thought it would be a long time before he sobered up, so I wandered down the street to kill time.</t5223> <t5224>At that moment, someone came and gave me a dime, asking me to take the boat across the river and then go catch a stray sheep.</t5224> <t5225>So I followed him.</t5225> <t5226>But when we brought the sheep to the boat.</t5226> <t5227>The sheep was so strong that it broke free and ran away, and we had to chase it.</t5227> <t5228>We ran through every nook and cranny until evening without finding it, so I headed back to the raft.</t5228> <t5229>When I got back, the raft was gone too.</t5229> <t5230>I told myself that something bad must have happened to the others, so they left and took my black friend with them.</t5230> <t5231>So I sat down and cried.</t5231> <t5232>I had to sleep in the forest all night.</t5232> <t5233>Poor Jim!</t5233>
<t5234>- He has forty dollars.</t5234> <t5235>When we caught him at that dilapidated house, it was exactly when he was gambling and lost everything, only having a little change left to buy alcohol.</t5235> <t5236>When I brought him back, the raft was already gone.</t5236> <t5237>We thought you had stolen the raft and fled.</t5237>
<t5238>- But what about my black man?</t5238> <t5239>He is my only relative.</t5239>
<t5240>- We don't think so.</t5240> <t5241>In fact, we already consider it our property.</t5241> <t5242>So when we saw the raft was gone, we returned empty-handed and had to put on this act.</t5242> <t5243>I haven't had anything to eat yet.</t5243> <t5244>Give me that penny.</t5244>
<t5245>I still had a lot of money, so I gave him a dime and told him to buy something for us to eat together, because that was all the money I had and I hadn't eaten anything since yesterday.</t5245> <t5246>He didn't say anything.</t5246> <t5247>A minute later, he asked me:</t5247>
<t5248>- Do you think that black guy will rat us out? If he does, we'll skin him alive.</t5248>
<t5249>- How dare it accuse you?</t5249> <t5250>It has already run away, hasn't it?</t5250>
<t5251>- That old man sold it, but he didn't give me a single penny.</t5251> <t5252>That money is all gone now.</t5252>
<t5253>I burst into tears:</t5253>
<t5254>- Sell him? He is my black man.</t5254> <t5255>He is my money.</t5255> <t5256>Give me back my black man.</t5256>
<t5257>- You won't get it back, so stop crying.</t5257> <t5258>Listen here, are you planning to accuse us? I can't trust you.</t5258>
<t5259>I saw a fierce look in his eyes.</t5259> <t5260>I kept crying and said:</t5260>
<t5261>- I don't want to accuse anyone.</t5261> <t5262>I have to go find my black man.</t5262>
<t5263>He stood there, still holding the advertisement in his hand, frowning in thought.</t5263> <t5264>He said:</t5264>
<t5265>- We stayed there for three more days.</t5265> <t5266>If you promise me that you won't report me, and won't let the black guy report me, then I'll tell you where to find him.</t5266>
<t5267>I promise.</t5267> <t5268>He said again:</t5268>
<t5269>- There was a ranch owner named Silas Ph...</t5269>
<t5270>He suddenly stopped.</t5270> <t5271>He probably intended to tell the truth, but then changed his mind.</t5271> <t5272>He still didn't trust me and wanted me to leave this place within three days.</t5272> <t5273>He continued:</t5273>
<t5274>- The person who bought Jim is Abram Foster, forty miles away from here, in the countryside, on the way to Lafayette</t5274>
<t5275>I said:</t5275>
<t5276>- Alright, I will go there this afternoon, it will take just three days to arrive.</t5276>
<t5277>- No, you should go right now.</t5277> <t5278>On the way, don't linger or chat with anyone, otherwise you'll get into trouble.</t5278>
<t5279>I also only hope for that, I already have a plan in my head.</t5279> <t5280>He said:</t5280>
<t5281>- Just go right away.</t5281> <t5282>When you meet Mr. Abram Foster, you can say whatever you want.</t5282> <t5283>Maybe you can convince him that Jim is your black servant, and he probably won't ask for any papers.</t5283> <t5284>Just go, say whatever you want when you meet him, but remember not to say a word from here to there.</t5284>
<t5285>I walked towards the outskirts.</t5285> <t5286>Although I didn't turn my head back, I still felt that he was watching me.</t5286> <t5287>I walked straight out to the outskirts about a mile away, then stopped, turned into the forest, and headed back to Mr. Phelps' house.</t5287> <t5288>I planned to carry out my plan immediately so that Jim wouldn't have time to report them, adding more trouble.</t5288> <t5289>Just hoping to escape from them would be a relief.</t5289>
<t5290>Chapter XXXII</t5290>
<t5291>When I arrived there, I saw that everything was as quiet as a Sunday.</t5291> <t5292>The sun was scorching hot.</t5292> <t5293>Everyone had gone to the fields to work.</t5293> <t5294>Only the buzzing of the flies made the atmosphere even more melancholic.</t5294> <t5295>I felt as if everyone had died.</t5295> <t5296>Every gust of wind that blew through made the leaves rustle, making the scene even sadder.</t5296> <t5297>Overall, looking at this scene, one just wanted to die to forget everything.</t5297>
<t5298>The Phelps' camp was a small cotton plantation with an iron fence running around it.</t5298> <t5299>A gate made of pieces of sawed-off wood.</t5299> <t5300>In the yard, there were a few patches of grass, bare and withered.</t5300> <t5301>A two-room wooden house for white people, made of small planks, patched together with mortar that had been whitewashed many times.</t5301> <t5302>A kitchen, with a wide roof extending to the main house.</t5302> <t5303>A woodshed behind the kitchen.</t5303> <t5304>Three rooms for black people right beside it.</t5304> <t5305>Next to the fence, at the back, there was a small shed for dumping ashes.</t5305> <t5306>On the kitchen door, a few water barrels were scattered around.</t5306> <t5307>Dogs lay basking in the sun.</t5307> <t5308>In the corner of the garden, there were a few sparse trees.</t5308> <t5309>Outside the fence, there was another garden with a melon trellis.</t5309> <t5310>Beyond that was the cotton field, and beyond the cotton field was the forest.</t5310>
<t5311>I walked around for a while and then climbed onto the roof to enter the kitchen area.</t5311> <t5312>After taking a few steps, I heard the hissing sound of a wheel echoing for a moment, then gradually fading away.</t5312> <t5313>At that moment, I felt like dying because that sound was so pitiful.</t5313> <t5314>I kept walking straight in, my mind blank, leaving everything to God.</t5314>
<t5315>Halfway there, a dog, then another, jumped at me.</t5315> <t5316>Of course, I stood still, looking at it.</t5316> <t5317>For nearly half a minute, I felt like I was spinning in the middle of a wheel trying to deal with the dogs.</t5317> <t5318>About fifteen of them surrounded me, pointing their snouts straight at me, barking loudly.</t5318> <t5319>Several other dogs crawled through the fence and from the corners of the garden came to completely encircle me.</t5319>
<t5320>A black woman ran out from the kitchen, holding a rolling pin in her hand, chasing the dogs!</t5320> <t5321>She struck each one of them, and they yelped and ran away.</t5321> <t5322>But just a second later, they came back, wagging their tails around me, looking very friendly.</t5322>
<t5323>Following the black woman was a black girl and two black boys, wearing only thick fabric shirts, clinging to their mother's clothes and hiding behind her, looking at me fearfully, as all black children usually do.</t5323> <t5324>Then I saw a white woman step out from the house, about forty-five to fifty years old, bareheaded, holding a knitting needle in her hand, followed by several white children, also hiding behind their mother and looking at me.</t5324> <t5325>She smiled with a very delighted expression and said:</t5325>
<t5326>- Is that you?</t5326>
<t5327>I didn't have time to think and immediately replied:</t5327>
<t5328>- Yes, ma'am</t5328>
<t5329>She hugged me tightly, tears streaming down.</t5329> <t5330>Hugging and shaking weren't enough, she kept talking nonstop:</t5330>
<t5331>- You don't resemble your mother as much as I thought.</t5331> <t5332>But thank God, I'm so happy to see you!</t5332> <t5333>I just want to give you a big hug! Kids, this is your cousin Tom! Say hello to him!</t5333>
<t5334>But they still put their fingers in their mouths and hid behind their mother.</t5334> <t5335>She continued:</t5335>
<t5336>- Lize, bring the hot food up for you.</t5336> <t5337>Or have you already had breakfast on the train?</t5337>
<t5338>I said I had eaten on the train.</t5338> <t5339>She led me into the house, the children running behind.</t5339> <t5340>Once inside, my grandmother sat me down on a reclining chair, then she sat down on a small stool, took my hands, and asked:</t5340>
<t5341>- Now, let me take a good look at my nephew's face.</t5341> <t5342>It's been worth all these years of waiting for you.</t5342> <t5343>Why are you so late, did the train run aground?</t5343>
<t5344>- Madam, yes, the train is..</t5344><t5345>.</t5345>
<t5346>- Don't call me grandma, call me Aunt Saly.</t5346> <t5347>So where did the ship run aground?</t5347>
<t5348>I don't know how to say it right away, because I don't know if the boat is coming down from above or going up from below.</t5348> <t5349>But I guess it's the boat coming up from Orleans.</t5349> <t5350>But even so, I'm still not at ease because I don't know the names of the docks down there.</t5350> <t5351>I think I need to make up a name or pretend to forget the place where it got stuck, or...</t5351> <t5352>Suddenly, an idea came to me, and I said:</t5352>
<t5353>- It's not that the ship got stuck, it's that the boiler exploded.</t5353>
<t5354>- Lord, is there anything wrong?</t5354>
<t5355>- No, sir, only one black man was killed.</t5355>
<t5356>- Lucky.</t5356> <t5357>The last few times, there were still people getting injured.</t5357> <t5358>Two years ago, your Uncle Silas came up from New Orleans, and the Lally Rock steamboat also had a boiler explosion that injured someone.</t5358> <t5359>It seems that person died later.</t5359> <t5360>Uncle Silas knew a family in Baton Rouge who knew him well. Oh, I remember now, he did die.</t5360> <t5361>Uncle Silas always mentions you whenever he comes here.</t5361> <t5362>He just left less than an hour ago and will be back soon.</t5362> <t5363>You must have met him on the way, right?</t5363> <t5364>He's old, so he's a bit confused...</t5364>
<t5365>- I didn't meet anyone, Aunt Saly.</t5365> <t5366>The ship docked early in the morning, I left my luggage at the dock and wandered around the town to avoid coming back here too early.</t5366>
<t5367>- Who do you give the luggage to?</t5367>
<t5368>- I didn't send it to anyone</t5368>
<t5369>- What if someone steals it?</t5369>
<t5370>- No, I hid it in a very secret place, no one can take it.</t5370>
<t5371>- If you arrive so early, how will you be able to have breakfast?</t5371>
<t5372>I was worried about how to respond, but then I replied:</t5372>
<t5373>- The captain saw you standing nearby and took you to the sailors' dining room, where he gave you a lot of food.</t5373>
<t5374>I felt restless so I couldn't hear clearly anymore.</t5374> <t5375>I just wanted to pull those kids away immediately to inquire about who I am.</t5375> <t5376>But Mrs. Phelps kept clinging to me, asking me one thing after another.</t5376> <t5377>A moment later, she asked me a question that startled me.</t5377>
<t5378>- Well, now tell me about your mother and everyone in your family.</t5378> <t5379>Whatever you think and remember, just tell me everything.</t5379>
<t5380>I was speechless.</t5380> <t5381>God has abandoned me.</t5381> <t5382>Well, I have no choice but to risk it.</t5382> <t5383>I opened my mouth to speak, but suddenly she pulled me aside, pushed me behind the bed, and said:</t5383>
<t5384>- Come back here!</t5384> <t5385>Lower your head, lower, so you can't see anything.</t5385> <t5386>Auntie is teasing you for fun.</t5386> <t5387>Kids, don't say anything, okay?</t5387>
<t5388>Now, I am in a difficult situation, but worrying is useless, the only thing to do is stand still and be ready to die.</t5388>
<t5389>The old man walked into the house.</t5389> <t5390>Blocked by the bed, I couldn't see anything.</t5390> <t5391>Mrs. Phelps rushed out and asked:</t5391>
<t5392>- Has it arrived yet?</t5392>
<t5393>- Not yet - The husband replied.</t5393>
<t5394>- Or has something bad happened again?</t5394>
<t5395>The man replied:</t5395>
<t5396>- I don't know.</t5396> <t5397>I'm also very worried.</t5397>
<t5398>- What? I'm going crazy here.</t5398> <t5399>It should have arrived by now, or did you not see it on the way?</t5399>
<t5400>- Saly, how could you meet and not recognize her?</t5400>
<t5401>- She will definitely avoid me.</t5401> <t5402>She should have arrived here by now.</t5402> <t5403>Maybe you just didn't see her.</t5403> <t5404>She...</t5404>
<t5405>- Please, don't say anything more.</t5405> <t5406>I'm also feeling very anxious right now.</t5406> <t5407>But there's no reason for it to have arrived, it can't have arrived without me meeting it.</t5407> <t5408>This is terrible, something must have happened on the ship.</t5408>
<t5409>- Look, Silas, do you see on the road over there, is someone coming?</t5409>
<t5410>He leaned out of the window right above the bed, and at that moment she quickly bent down to the foot of the bed to pull me out. I stepped out, and when he turned back, he saw his wife standing there smiling, her face as red as a stove, while I stood next to her, timid and fearful.</t5410> <t5411>He stared at me and then asked:</t5411>
<t5412>- Who is that?</t5412>
<t5413>- Don't you know who that is?</t5413>
<t5414>- No, I give up.</t5414>
<t5415>- It's Tom Sawyer!</t5415>
<t5416>I almost fainted and collapsed to the ground.</t5416> <t5417>But the man grabbed my hand and kept shaking it, while his wife jumped around, laughing and talking.</t5417> <t5418>The couple asked me countless questions about Sid, Mary, and all the relatives.</t5418>
<t5419>But if they were happy one-fold, I was happy ten-fold.</t5419> <t5420>I felt as if I was born anew, I was joyful because I knew who I was.</t5420> <t5421>The past two hours, I was scared out of my wits.</t5421> <t5422>I also told them many more things about my family - that is, about Tom Sawyer's family.</t5422> <t5423>Then I recounted the story of the boiler explosion on the White River, and how I had to stay there for three days.</t5423> <t5424>By this time, I felt quite at ease, but there were still many things to worry about.</t5424> <t5425>Playing the role of Tom Sawyer was very easy, but my heart skipped a beat whenever I heard the chugging sound of a boat on the river because what if Tom was on that boat?</t5425>
<t5426>It can't be left like this.</t5426> <t5427>I have to go out on the street to pick it up first.</t5427> <t5428>Thinking that, I told everyone that I wanted to go get the luggage.</t5428> <t5429>The husband also wanted to go with me, but I refused, as I could drive the carriage myself and didn't want to trouble him.</t5429>
<t5430>Chapter XXXIII</t5430>
<t5431>I drove the horse-drawn carriage to the town.</t5431> <t5432>Halfway there, I encountered another carriage coming towards me.</t5432> <t5433>It was indeed Tom Sawyer.</t5433> <t5434>I stopped the carriage and waited for him to come closer.</t5434> <t5435>I shouted:</t5435>
<t5436>- Stop the car!</t5436>
<t5437>Tom opened his mouth wide, stood still in silence, swallowed a few times, and then said:</t5437>
<t5438>- I haven't done anything to harm you.</t5438> <t5439>Why do you still come back here to scare me?</t5439>
<t5440>I said:</t5440>
<t5441>- I didn't die, so why would I come back as a ghost?</t5441>
<t5442>Hearing my voice, it seemed less scared, but still trembling.</t5442> <t5443>It said</t5443>
<t5444>- You're not kidding me, are you? You're not a ghost, are you?</t5444>
<t5445>- I'm not a ghost.</t5445>
<t5446>- But I still don't understand.</t5446> <t5447>So, weren't you killed</t5447><t5448>?</t5448>
<t5449>- No, I have never been killed.</t5449> <t5450>Come closer and if you don't believe it, just touch me and see.</t5450>
<t5451>It came close to touch me, realizing it was true, it was so happy but it didn't know what to do yet.</t5451> <t5452>And it wanted to know everything immediately, but I told it I would explain later, and for now, to tell the driver to wait.</t5452> <t5453>Then I pulled it aside, told it about my dilemma, and asked how to handle it.</t5453> <t5454>After thinking for a minute, it said:</t5454>
<t5455>- Alright, I've got a plan.</t5455> <t5456>Take my chest, put it in your car and act like it's yours, then you drive back slowly, timing it so you get home just in time.</t5456> <t5457>I'll head to the city for a bit and then start back, arriving about fifteen minutes or half an hour after you, and at first, you have to act like you don't know who I am.</t5457>
<t5458>I said:</t5458>
<t5459>- Wait a minute. There's one more thing.</t5459> <t5460>That is, there's a black man here, I'm trying to save him from being enslaved, his name is Jim. Miss Watson's Jim, you know.</t5460><t5461>right</t5461>
<t5462>It was surprised:</t5462>
<t5463>- What? Jim? He... he... .</t5463>
<t5464>I said immediately:</t5464>
<t5465>- I know what you're going to say.</t5465> <t5466>You're going to say this is a bad, despicable thing: but so what?</t5466> <t5467>I know it's not good, but I'm going to steal it.</t5467> <t5468>You have to keep it a secret and not tell anyone, okay?</t5468>
<t5469>Its eyes lit up:</t5469>
<t5470>- I will help you steal it back!</t5470>
<t5471>What surprised me the most was that I had never heard of it and I am ready to say that Tom deserves a lot of my admiration.</t5471> <t5472>But the thing is, I still can't believe it, Tom Sawyer as a person who would steal black people?</t5472><t5473>?</t5473>
<t5474>I said:</t5474>
<t5475>- Stop it, don't joke like that.</t5475>
<t5476>- I'm being serious.</t5476>
<t5477>I said:</t5477>
<t5478>- Alright, joke or no joke, if you hear about a runaway black man, you have to remember that you know nothing about him, and I know nothing about him either.</t5478>
<t5479>He went to get the chest and put it in my car, then he went his way, and I went mine.</t5479> <t5480>But somehow I completely forgot to drive slowly, because I was too excited and thinking about many things. As a result, I got home too quickly.</t5480> <t5481>Mr. Phelps was standing at the door waiting for me, and when he saw that I had returned, he said:</t5481>
<t5482>- Well, I never expected this horse to run so fast.</t5482> <t5483>And yet it doesn't sweat a bit, not a single hair is wet.</t5483> <t5484>It's amazing.</t5484> <t5485>Now, even if someone offers a hundred dollars, I wouldn't sell it anymore.</t5485> <t5486>Yet before, I intended to sell it for just fifteen dollars, thinking that's all it was worth.</t5486>
<t5487>He only said maybe.</t5487> <t5488>I have never seen an old man as kind and gentle as him.</t5488> <t5489>He was originally a landowner and also served as a pastor.</t5489> <t5490>He personally spent money to build a church at the end of the plantation, and he preached there without taking any money. In the South, there are many people who are both landowners and pastors like that.</t5490>
<t5491>About half an hour later, Tom's car arrived in front of the door.</t5491> <t5492>Aunt Saly also saw it through the window.</t5492> <t5493>She said:</t5493>
<t5494>- Who could it be? It might be a stranger, Jimmy (the name of a child).</t5494> <t5495>Go tell Lize to set an extra plate.</t5495>
<t5496>Everyone rushed to the front door because it was very rare for strangers to visit here.</t5496> <t5497>Tom had reached the fence and was walking into the house, the carriage continued into the village, and we were all standing outside the door.</t5497> <t5498>Tom was dressed in ready-made clothes, looking dignified.</t5498> <t5499>He was not a timid person like a sheep.</t5499> <t5500>As he approached us, he gracefully and politely took off his hat, as if he were holding a lid with butterflies perched and sleeping on it that he didn't want to disturb.</t5500> <t5501>He asked:</t5501>
<t5502>- Excuse me, is this the house of Archibald Nichols?</t5502>
<t5503>Mr. Phen replied:</t5503>
<t5504>- That's not right.</t5504> <t5505>I'm sorry, but the coachman has deceived you.</t5505> <t5506>Mr. Nichols' house is still three miles away from here.</t5506> <t5507>Come in first.</t5507>
<t5508>Tom turned around and said:</t5508>
<t5509>- It's too late, the bus has gone too far.</t5509>
<t5510>- Come in and have dinner with us first, then we will arrange a car to take you to Mr. Nichols' house.</t5510>
<t5511>- Oh, I wouldn't dare trouble you both.</t5511> <t5512>It's just a short walk to get there.</t5512>
<t5513>- But we won't let you walk.</t5513> <t5514>Southern people are very hospitable.</t5514> <t5515>Just come in here first.</t5515>
<t5516>Aunt Saly said:</t5516>
<t5517>- Please come in, we don't mind at all.</t5517> <t5518>You must stay here for now.</t5518> <t5519>The road to there is as far as three miles and very dusty, we can't let you walk.</t5519> <t5520>Moreover, we have already set extra plates.</t5520> <t5521>Make yourself at home, Thompson.</t5521>
<t5522>So Tom thanked very enthusiastically and skillfully, pretending to reluctantly step into the house; then he said that he was from Ohio and his name was William Thompson.</t5522>
<t5523>He rambled on endlessly about all the things he made up in Ohio, and I started to feel uneasy and worried about how he intended to help me get out of this difficult situation.</t5523> <t5524>Finally, in the middle of the conversation, he suddenly stood up and kissed Aunt Saly right on the mouth, then sat back down properly in his chair and continued talking.</t5524> <t5525>Aunt Saly jerked back, wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, and said:</t5525>
<t5526>- This boy is too rude!</t5526>
<t5527>It seemed to be offended, saying:</t5527>
<t5528>- Madam, why is it so?</t5528>
<t5529>- Who do you think I am?</t5529> <t5530>What do you mean by kissing me?</t5530>
<t5531>It again made a very polite response:</t5531>
<t5532>-Madam, it doesn't mean anything at all, I thought you liked it that way.</t5532>
<t5533>Are you crazy? - She grabbed the rolling pin intending to hit him with it but managed to restrain herself - Why would you think I would like that?</t5533>
<t5534>- I don't know.</t5534> <t5535>They said that you like it that way.</t5535>
<t5536>- Whoever told you that is crazy.</t5536> <t5537>I have never heard anyone say something so strange.</t5537> <t5538>Who are they?</t5538>
<t5539>- Everyone says so, ma'am.</t5539>
<t5540>At this point, Mrs. Saly couldn't stand it any longer, her eyes blinked, her fingers twitched as if wanting to scratch it, and she asked:</t5540>
<t5541>- Who are all these people? What are their names? Speak quickly, or don't blame me.</t5541>
<t5542>Tom stood up, pretending to be disappointed, picked up his hat, and said:</t5542>
<t5543>- I'm sorry.</t5543> <t5544>I didn't expect things to turn out this way.</t5544> <t5545>They all told me to kiss you because you really like it.</t5545> <t5546>From now on, I promise I won't do it again unless you ask me to.</t5546>
<t5547>- My request? Since I was little, I have never seen anything as strange as this.</t5547> <t5548>Especially from someone like you.</t5548>
<t5549>It looked around, seemingly wanting to meet a friendly gaze, then looked at Mr. Phelps and asked:</t5549>
<t5550>- Do you think she wants the child to kiss her, sir?</t5550>
<t5551>- No, I don't think so.</t5551>
<t5552>Then it looked at me again in the same way and asked:</t5552>
<t5553>- Tom, do you think Aunt Sally will open her arms and call: Sid Sawyer?</t5553>
<t5554>- Oh my God - Aunt Saly exclaimed and jumped towards him - you little rascal, did you trick me?</t5554> <t5555>Just as she was about to hug him, he pushed her away and said:</t5555>
<t5556>- No, we have to wait for Auntie's request first!</t5556>
<t5557>So she immediately asked for it, and hugged it tightly, kissing it several times, then turned it towards her husband, who also kissed it for a while.</t5557> <t5558>After a while, when everything was quiet, she said:</t5558>
<t5559>- Auntie has never been so surprised.</t5559> <t5560>Your uncle and I thought only Tom was coming.</t5560> <t5561>The letter only mentioned that Tom would come.</t5561>
<t5562>It says</t5562>
<t5563>- That’s because aunt only wanted Tom to come, and didn’t want anyone else to come.</t5563> <t5564>But I kept asking, and finally, my mom let me go too.</t5564> <t5565>After getting off the boat, Tom and I discussed that we should surprise aunt, so he would arrive first and I would pretend to just pass by and drop in, acting like a stranger.</t5565>
<t5566>- I almost broke my teeth.</t5566> <t5567>It's been a long time since I was so shocked. Oh, thinking about the moment you kissed her like that, I was scared to death.</t5567>
<t5568>We had lunch in the wide corridor connecting the main house with the kitchen.</t5568> <t5569>The table was set with all sorts of dishes, enough for seven servants to finish, and every dish was hot. Uncle Silas cared a lot about the food and never let it get cold.</t5569>
<t5570>Throughout that entire afternoon, Tom and I had to be constantly on guard while talking about various things.</t5570> <t5571>But no one mentioned the runaway black man, and we were also afraid to bring it up.</t5571> <t5572>At dinner, a child asked:</t5572>
<t5573>- Dad, can you take Tom, Sid, and me to the theater?</t5573>
<t5574>- No - the father replied - maybe it won't be performed, and even if it is, you kids won't be able to go, because the runaway black man told Mr. Burton that he would inform everyone, this time they might kick those useless guys out of here.</t5574>
<t5575>I don't know what to do.</t5575> <t5576>Tom and I also slept in the same room upstairs and shared a bed.</t5576> <t5577>Using the excuse of being too tired, we asked to go to bed immediately after eating.</t5577> <t5578>Then we climbed out the window, slid down the lamppost to the ground, and went into town.</t5578> <t5579>Because I didn't believe that anyone here had informed the king and the duke, if I didn't go and inform them, they would be in danger.</t5579>
<t5580>On the way, Tom told me all about how everyone thought I had been killed, then my father disappeared and didn't come back, and how there was a commotion when Jim ran away.</t5580> <t5581>As for me, I told him about the two scoundrels performing in the play "The Royal Nonesuch," and about the journey on the wooden raft from then until now.</t5581> <t5582>Around half-past eight, we had reached the middle of the town when we suddenly saw a crowd of people carrying torches, banging pots and pans, and blowing horns.</t5582> <t5583>We quickly jumped to the side of the road to let them pass.</t5583> <t5584>As they went by, we saw they were leading the king and the duke, who were trapped in an iron bar, their bodies covered in tar and feathers, no longer looking human.</t5584> <t5585>Seeing that scene, I felt moved and sorry for those two wretched scoundrels.</t5585> <t5586>How can people be so disgustingly cruel to one another?</t5586>
<t5587>We know that it is already too late, there's nothing we can do anymore.</t5587> <t5588>When asked a few people, they said that everyone went to watch the play, pretending not to know anything.</t5588> <t5589>Wait until the king is gesticulating on stage, then someone gives a signal, and the whole theater rushes up to capture him.</t5589>
<t5590>We returned home, and we were no longer as eager as when we left.</t5590> <t5591>I felt somewhat to blame even though I had nothing to do with this incident.</t5591> <t5592>Whether one does right or wrong, if a person doesn't realize it, it still gnaws at them just the same.</t5592> <t5593>Tom Sawyer said the same thing.</t5593>
<t5594>Chapter XXXIV</t5594>
<t5595>We stopped talking and started thinking.</t5595> <t5596>A moment later, Tom said:</t5596>
<t5597>- Hey Huck, we were so dumb.</t5597> <t5598>It was possible, but we couldn't think of it.</t5598> <t5599>I know where Jim is now.</t5599>
<t5600>- where?</t5600>
<t5601>- in the tent below the ash house.</t5601> <t5602>Don't you remember seeing a black man go in there with some food?</t5602>
<t5603>- Yes.</t5603>
<t5604>- Who do you think he gave it to?</t5604>
<t5605>- For the dog.</t5605>
<t5606>- I thought so too.</t5606> <t5607>But it's not for the dog.</t5607>
<t5608>- Why?</t5608>
<t5609>- Because there is a piece of melon in it.</t5609>
<t5610>- That's right, I noticed that too.</t5610> <t5611>But I thought dogs could eat melons, so I didn't suspect anything.</t5611>
<t5612>- The black man unlocked the door when he entered, locked it again when he left, and then gave the key to Mr. Phelps.</t5612> <t5613>That means there is someone inside.</t5613> <t5614>If it's locked, it means someone is imprisoned.</t5614> <t5615>But it doesn't make sense that in this small plantation there would be two people imprisoned, because I see everyone is good.</t5615> <t5616>It's clear that Jim is imprisoned.</t5616> <t5617>I am determined to find Jim. Now, you come up with a plan to rescue Jim, and I'll think of another plan, then we'll see which one is better and do it.</t5617>
<t5618>Tom is really clever.</t5618> <t5619>If I had a mind like his, I wouldn't have been tormented by the king and the duke for so long.</t5619> <t5620>I'm thinking of a plan, but only vaguely.</t5620> <t5621>A moment later, Tom asked:</t5621>
<t5622>- Have you finished thinking?</t5622>
<t5623>- Okay. - I replied.</t5623>
<t5624>- You tell me.</t5624>
<t5625>I said:</t5625>
<t5626>- My plan is like this.</t5626> <t5627>We go find Jim, this part is easy.</t5627> <t5628>Tomorrow morning, I'll retrieve my canoe hidden at the island.</t5628> <t5629>At night, we'll steal his keys after he goes to sleep.</t5629> <t5630>Then we'll head straight to the river, get Jim on the raft, hide during the day, and travel at night, just like Jim and I used to do before.</t5630> <t5631>Does that sound good?</t5631>
<t5632>- Can it be done?</t5632> <t5633>Of course it can, but it's like mice biting each other.</t5633> <t5634>What kind of plan is this, so simple, nothing thrilling or sensational.</t5634> <t5635>If people talk about it later, it will just be in passing.</t5635> <t5636>That's really boring.</t5636>
<t5637>I didn't say anything, because I didn't expect anything different, as his plans were always the best.</t5637> <t5638>Indeed. He talked about his plan.</t5638> <t5639>After listening, I realized it would take fifteen people like me to come up with it, and only then could Jim become as free as I am.</t5639> <t5640>I agreed, and we immediately set out to execute it.</t5640> <t5641>I don't need to explain the plan here, as it would change during execution and many other things would need to be added.</t5641>
<t5642>There is one thing that is most certain: Tom Sawyer was very eager to rescue that black man from slavery.</t5642> <t5643>That was beyond my imagination.</t5643> <t5644>This was a respectable boy, well-educated, and had a special temperament.</t5644> <t5645>But his family was the same.</t5645> <t5646>He was outstanding, not dull; he knew various things, not ignorant; he was not bad, but kind-hearted.</t5646> <t5647>Yet now, he humbly bowed to do such a thing, something that would bring shame to him and his family before everyone.</t5647> <t5648>It was truly disgraceful, and I thought I must tell him that immediately.</t5648> <t5649>As his close friend, I had to advise him to abandon that idea, to save himself.</t5649> <t5650>I was just about to speak when he stopped me and said:</t5650>
<t5651>- You think I don't know what I'm doing</t5651><t5652>?</t5652>
<t5653>- Yes.</t5653>
<t5654>- I told you I would help you get back the black guy, didn't I?</t5654>
<t5655>- That's right.</t5655>
<t5656>- So, what else are you planning?</t5656>
<t5657>It only said maybe, and I said the same.</t5657> <t5658>I knew saying more would be useless because when it says something, it will definitely do it.</t5658> <t5659>But I still don't understand why it wants to plunge into things like this.</t5659> <t5660>I just let it be and didn't bother thinking about it anymore.</t5660>
<t5661>When we got home, it was already dark and very quiet.</t5661> <t5662>We made our way to the tent below the ash house to investigate.</t5662> <t5663>We went through the yard to see if the dogs would bark loudly.</t5663> <t5664>But the dogs recognized us and didn't bark at all.</t5664> <t5665>Approaching the tent, looking carefully in front and on both sides, we saw a small square window with a board nailed tightly outside.</t5665> <t5666>I said:</t5666>
<t5667>- This spot is good.</t5667> <t5668>This hole is both large and just enough for Jim to fit through if we can remove that plank.</t5668>
<t5669>Tom said:</t5669>
<t5670>- Well, that's as easy as turning your hand over.</t5670> <t5671>I think we could find a way that's even harder than that.</t5671>
<t5672>- Okay, let's saw that plank.</t5672>
<t5673>- That's somewhat acceptable, seems secretive and challenging.</t5673> <t5674>But I think we can find a way that takes twice as long, there's no need to rush, so we can look around here first.</t5674>
<t5675>Between the tent and the fence, there was a long roof as long as the tent, but narrower, only about one meter.</t5675> <t5676>The entrance door was tightly locked.</t5676> <t5677>Tom went to the shed, looked around, and brought back an iron bar used to pry open box lids.</t5677> <t5678>He used the iron bar to pry open a door.</t5678> <t5679>The chain fell down.</t5679> <t5680>We opened the door and stepped inside, then closed the door again.</t5680> <t5681>Striking a match, we saw that this roof was just leaning against the tent and had no passage through.</t5681> <t5682>Inside, there were only a few worn-out shovels and hoes.</t5682> <t5683>When the match went out, we stepped out, reattached the iron hook, and the door closed as before.</t5683> <t5684>Tom was secretly pleased.</t5684> <t5685>He said:</t5685>
<t5686>- That's settled.</t5686> <t5687>We'll dig a hole for him.</t5687> <t5688>It will take about a week.</t5688>
<t5689>Then we went back to the room.</t5689> <t5690>I entered through the back door, just had to lift the leather strap to open it, because they didn't tie it.</t5690> <t5691>But Tom Sawyer thought that wasn't thrilling enough, so he had to climb up the column.</t5691> <t5692>Three times he climbed halfway up and then slid down.</t5692> <t5693>The third time he fell so hard it seemed like he might have cracked his head, he decided to give up, but after thinking for a while, he climbed again.</t5693> <t5694>This time he made it.</t5694>
<t5695>The next morning, we got up early and went down to the house of the black people to get acquainted with the black man who always brought food for Jim. They had just finished breakfast and were about to go to the fields, while the black man who usually went to Jim was packing meat pies and other things into an iron pot.</t5695> <t5696>When everyone had left, the key was brought down.</t5696>
<t5697>This black man looks very gentle.</t5697> <t5698>His clothes are tied up in several places with strings.</t5698> <t5699>That is to ward off evil spirits. He said that in the past few nights, evil spirits have been disturbing him a lot; he saw many strange things, heard all kinds of strange voices and noises, and he couldn't believe that in his life until now he had been so harassed by evil spirits.</t5699> <t5700>He spoke very passionately and repeatedly recounted those frightening things, completely forgetting what he was supposed to do now.</t5700> <t5701>Tom asked:</t5701>
<t5702>- What is this food for? To feed the dog?</t5702>
<t5703>The black man gradually revealed a smile and replied:</t5703>
<t5704>- The dog is very strange.</t5704> <t5705>Do you want to go see it?</t5705>
<t5706>- Of course</t5706>
<t5707>I nudged Tom and whispered:</t5707>
<t5708>- Why is this happening in broad daylight?</t5708> <t5709>Wasn't that the plan?</t5709>
<t5710>- It wasn't like that before, but now it has to be.</t5710>
<t5711>We went out, but I didn't like it much.</t5711> <t5712>When stepping into the tent, we couldn't see anything because it was too dark.</t5712> <t5713>But Jim was indeed in there, Jim saw us and shouted loudly:</t5713>
<t5714>- Oh, Huck, and Tom too</t5714><t5715>?</t5715>
<t5716>I knew this would happen sooner or later.</t5716> <t5717>What can we do now? The black man exclaimed:</t5717>
<t5718>- Oh Lord, does he know you guys?</t5718>
<t5719>Tom looked at the black man, seemingly astonished, and asked again:</t5719>
<t5720>- Who knows us?</t5720>
<t5721>- This black guy.</t5721>
<t5722>- I don't really know.</t5722> <t5723>But why do you think so?</t5723>
<t5724>- He just called you guys, didn't he?</t5724>
<t5725>Tom seemed confused and said:</t5725>
<t5726>- Strange, isn't it? Who's calling?</t5726> <t5727>When did they call? How did they call?</t5727>
<t5728>Then it calmly turned back to me and continued to ask:</t5728>
<t5729>- Did you hear someone calling?</t5729>
<t5730>Of course, I couldn't say otherwise and tell:</t5730>
<t5731>- No, I didn't hear anyone calling.</t5731>
<t5732>Then it turned back to Jim, acting like a stranger, and asked:</t5732>
<t5733>- Did you just call us?</t5733>
<t5734>Jim replied:</t5734>
<t5735>- No, I didn't call anything.</t5735>
<t5736>- Have you ever met us?</t5736>
<t5737>- Not yet.</t5737>
<t5738>Tom turned around, the black man now frightened and disappointed, spoke in a stern voice:</t5738>
<t5739>- Why do you think someone called?</t5739>
<t5740>- Oh, sir, it's those ghosts haunting me again.</t5740> <t5741>If they keep hovering around me like this, I'm afraid I'll die of fright.</t5741> <t5742>Please don't tell anyone about this, or Mr. Silas will scold me; he says there are no such things as ghosts.</t5742>
<t5743>Tom gave him a penny and told him not to be afraid, promising not to tell anyone.</t5743> <t5744>He also told him to buy more rope to tie up the clothes.</t5744> <t5745>Then he turned to Jim and said:</t5745>
<t5746>- I don't know if Silas intends to hang this black man or not.</t5746> <t5747>If I caught any ungrateful black man running away, I would have to hang him, no mercy.</t5747>
<t5748>And while the black man stepped outside the door to take a closer look at the half-dollar, raising it up to bite and see if it was good, Tom whispered into Jim's ear:</t5748>
<t5749>- Don't reveal that you know us.</t5749> <t5750>At night, if you hear the sound of digging, it's us digging.</t5750> <t5751>We will get you out.</t5751>
<t5752>Jim only had time to grab our hands and squeeze tightly.</t5752> <t5753>The black man turned around, and we told him that we would come whenever he needed us.</t5753> <t5754>He said he hoped so because ghosts often came to him at night, so having someone around would make him less scared.</t5754>
<t5755>Chapter XXXV</t5755>
<t5756>Almost an hour before breakfast time, we ran into the forest.</t5756> <t5757>Tom said we needed light to dig the earth, but using a lamp would be too conspicuous, so we had to gather glowing rotten branches that people call firefly wood.</t5757> <t5758>We collected an armful and hid it in the thick grass.</t5758> <t5759>While resting, Tom said, looking somewhat dissatisfied:</t5759>
<t5760>- Everything is too easy and boring.</t5760> <t5761>Finding a difficult plan is not easy.</t5761> <t5762>There is no guard for the prisoner so I can use the sleeping potion.</t5762> <t5763>And Jim is only shackled by one leg to the bed, so all I have to do is lift the bed and pull the chain out.</t5763> <t5764>And Uncle Silas gave the key to that foolish black man.</t5764> <t5765>Jim could also crawl out through the window hole, but he can't drag the chain far.</t5765> <t5766>It's so boring, I find all the arrangements too ordinary, so we have to create all sorts of difficulties.</t5766> <t5767>Rescuing him from here must involve many difficulties and dangers to be impressive.</t5767> <t5768>If no one causes those difficulties for us, we have to think and create those difficulties ourselves. Ah, I think we could use the saw if we have the chance.</t5768>
<t5769>- What are you using the saw for?</t5769>
<t5770>- Saw off the leg of Jim's bed to remove the chain.</t5770>
<t5771>- So you just said that if we lift the bed, we can pull the chain out right away?</t5771>
<t5772>- You're as dumb as a cow.</t5772> <t5773>You play like a child.</t5773> <t5774>Haven't you ever read books? Baron Trenck, Casanova.</t5774> <t5775>Benvenuto Cellini, Henry the Fourth, all those heroes, haven't you ever read about them?</t5775> <t5776>Has anyone ever rescued a prisoner in such a womanly way? You have to saw the bed leg in half, then erase all traces of sawdust so no one can see, smear some dirt or grease on the sawed part so that even the sharp-eyed warden can't see the cut and thinks the bed leg is intact, then lift the chain off.</t5776> <t5777>That's it.</t5777> <t5778>Then you just have to place the rope ladder into the loophole, climb out, and slide down into a moat. Down there, horses and servants are ready to help you mount, and then you go; go back to your homeland, Languedoc or Nava, or somewhere else.</t5778> <t5779>Oh, it's wonderful.</t5779> <t5780>I want a trench leading to that hut.</t5780> <t5781>If we have time, we will dig a trench.</t5781>
<t5782>I asked:</t5782>
<t5783>- But we were planning to let it slip out at the foot of the prison cell wall, weren't we? Why do we need to dig a trench?</t5783>
<t5784>It didn't hear me say anything.</t5784> <t5785>It had forgotten that I was sitting there, and forgotten everything.</t5785> <t5786>It rested its chin on its hand, thinking.</t5786> <t5787>After a while, it sighed and shook its head.</t5787> <t5788>Then it sighed again and said:</t5788>
<t5789>- No, it's not possible, it's not really necessary.</t5789>
<t5790>- What did you say you don't need?</t5790>
<t5791>- Ah, the matter of sawing off Jim's leg.</t5791>
<t5792>- Oh my God! Why is that? So what are you planning to do by cutting off Jim's leg?</t5792>
<t5793>- Some famous people do that.</t5793> <t5794>They can't remove the chains, so they just cut off one of their arms.</t5794> <t5795>Better to have one leg left than none.</t5795> <t5796>But maybe we shouldn't do that.</t5796> <t5797>This case doesn't really require it, and besides, Jim is a black man, he wouldn't understand why we would do such a thing.</t5797> <t5798>But we can make him a rope ladder.</t5798> <t5799>We could tear the bed sheet into strips and make him a rope ladder.</t5799> <t5800>And we could hide the rope ladder inside a cake and give it to him.</t5800> <t5801>That's how they usually do it.</t5801> <t5802>And it has to be a really big cake.</t5802>
<t5803>- What are you talking about?</t5803> <t5804>Why would Jim need a rope ladder?</t5804>
<t5805>- Do what? He could hide it in the bed.</t5805> <t5806>Everyone does that, so Jim has to do it too.</t5806> <t5807>Huck, it seems like you never want to do anything by the rules, you always want to do something new.</t5807> <t5808>So you don't think they need to leave any traces?</t5808><t5809>?</t5809>
<t5810>I said:</t5810>
<t5811>- Alright, if everyone else is doing it, then we should follow suit to comply with the rules.</t5811> <t5812>But Tom Sawyer, if we tear the bed sheets into pieces to make a rope ladder for Jim, we'll get into trouble with Aunt Sally.</t5812> <t5813>Now I think this, making a ladder out of bark would also keep it hidden.</t5813> <t5814>As for Jim, he has no experience, so anything would be fine for him.</t5814>
<t5815>- Huck Finn, if I were as dumb as you, I'd rather keep quiet.</t5815> <t5816>Has anyone ever heard of someone escaping from prison using a bark ladder? That's utterly ridiculous.</t5816>
<t5817>- Fine, it's up to you.</t5817> <t5818>Or maybe we could borrow a bedsheet from the clothesline outside?</t5818>
<t5819>It said that's fine too.</t5819> <t5820>But then it came up with another idea:</t5820>
<t5821>- Borrow another shirt.</t5821>
<t5822>- What for, Tom?</t5822>
<t5823>- Let Jim write his diary in there</t5823>
<t5824>- Diary my foot, Jim doesn't even know how to write.</t5824>
<t5825>- He doesn't know how to write, but he can scribble a few lines.</t5825> <t5826>We can make him a pen out of an iron spoon or a piece of iron from a barrel hoop.</t5826>
<t5827>- Should I pluck a goose feather to make him a pen?</t5827> <t5828>It would be quick too.</t5828>
<t5829>How could the imprisoned people see a goose to get goose feathers for making pens, how foolish are you? They always have to use something really hard, really rough, like the bronze leg of a candlestick or something else they can grab in the prison tower to make a pen.</t5829> <t5830>Then it takes weeks, even months to make a pen, because they have to grind it against the prison wall at night.</t5830> <t5831>Even if they had goose feathers, they wouldn't use them.</t5831> <t5832>Because that would not be according to the rules.</t5832>
<t5833>- Then what will we use for ink?</t5833>
<t5834>- Many people use rust with tears as ink, but that's a common and very feminine style.</t5834> <t5835>Famous guys use their own blood as ink.</t5835> <t5836>Jim can do that.</t5836> <t5837>And whenever he wants to send a small, ordinary but secret letter to let people know where he's imprisoned, he can write it on the bottom of an iron plate, then throw it out the window.</t5837> <t5838>The Iron Mask gang often did that, it's really amazing.</t5838>
<t5839>- How could Jim have a metal plate?</t5839> <t5840>They fed him using a pot.</t5840>
<t5841>- That doesn't matter.</t5841> <t5842>I'll get him a few plates.</t5842>
<t5843>- But who can read his handwriting?</t5843>
<t5844>- It's okay.</t5844> <t5845>He just needs to write on the disc and throw it out.</t5845> <t5846>There's no need to read it.</t5846> <t5847>Most people can't read what a prisoner writes on the iron disc.</t5847>
<t5848>- It's such a waste of a disc.</t5848>
<t5849>- It's not a prisoner's plate to worry about wasting.</t5849>
<t5850>- So, it's someone's plate, right?</t5850>
<t5851>- Well, let's say it belongs to someone, but why should the prisoner care?</t5851>
<t5852>It suddenly stopped talking because we had heard the bell calling us for breakfast.</t5852> <t5853>We hurried back home.</t5853>
<t5854>That morning, I borrowed a bedsheet and a shirt from the clothesline, found an old bag, stuffed those things in it, then went downstairs to get some rotten firewood and put everything into the bag.</t5854> <t5855>I called it borrowing because my father usually called it that.</t5855> <t5856>But Tom said it wasn't borrowing, it was stealing.</t5856> <t5857>He said that the two of us were representing the imprisoned; and for the imprisoned, any way to get them supplies was acceptable, and no one would blame them for it.</t5857> <t5858>For a prisoner, taking what they need to escape is not a crime, it's their right, Tom said.</t5858> <t5859>So if we were representing the imprisoned, we had every right to steal anything on their behalf, at least anything that could be used to escape from prison.</t5859> <t5860>He also said that if we weren't prisoners, then it would be a different story, and if someone who wasn't a prisoner stole, they would just be a very bad person.</t5860> <t5861>Therefore, we thought we could steal anything we could get our hands on.</t5861> <t5862>Yet, one day, I stole a watermelon from the black man's garden to eat, and he scolded me harshly, then he gave the black people a dime without saying what it was for.</t5862> <t5863>Tom said that we should only steal things we needed.</t5863> <t5864>I said that I needed a watermelon.</t5864> <t5865>He said we didn't need a watermelon to escape from prison.</t5865> <t5866>He said if I could hide a knife and give it to Jim so he could kill the warden, that would be very good.</t5866> <t5867>I had to agree, although I thought it was pointless to be so far-fetched, and I'd rather just eat a watermelon.</t5867>
<t5868>Then, that morning, after waiting for everyone to go out to the fields, Tom took the sack to the back of the hut while I stayed behind to keep watch.</t5868> <t5869>A little later, he came out, and the two of us sat down on the logs to talk.</t5869> <t5870>He said:</t5870>
<t5871>- Everything is done, only the tools are missing, but this is not too difficult.</t5871>
<t5872>- What tool? - I asked.</t5872>
<t5873>- Tools for digging, what else would they be for?</t5873> <t5874>Aren't we planning to dig in there to pull him out?</t5874>
<t5875>It turned to look at me with a pitying expression that could make one cry, then said:</t5875>
<t5876>- Huck Finn, have you ever heard of a prisoner having a pickaxe to dig with?</t5876> <t5877>Why not just give him the key to make it easier?</t5877>
<t5878>I said:</t5878>
<t5879>- Well, if we don't need hoes and shovels, then what do we need?</t5879>
<t5880>- A few knives.</t5880>
<t5881>- Can you really dig it up?</t5881><t5882>?</t5882>
<t5883>- Yes</t5883>
<t5884>- I think this is crazy.</t5884>
<t5885>- I need to know.</t5885> <t5886>In my opinion, that's the proper way to do it.</t5886> <t5887>There's no other way.</t5887> <t5888>I haven't heard of any other way.</t5888> <t5889>I've read all the books about these matters.</t5889> <t5890>They always dig with a knife, and you should remember that it's not just digging soil, but often digging through stone as well.</t5890> <t5891>And that takes countless weeks.</t5891> <t5892>Do you know how long it took a prisoner to dig the Deep Castle in Marseille?</t5892>
<t5893>- I don't know.</t5893>
<t5894>- Try to guess.</t5894>
<t5895>- A month and a half at most.</t5895>
<t5896>- Thirty-seven years, then he crawled all the way to China. Just like that.</t5896> <t5897>If only this foundation were made of hard stone, it would be so much better.</t5897>
<t5898>- Jim doesn't know anyone in China, does he?</t5898>
<t5899>- What does that have to do with anything?</t5899> <t5900>The other person is the same.</t5900> <t5901>But you're straying from the point, let's get back to the main topic.</t5901>
<t5902>- Alright, I don't need to know where he gets to, as long as he gets outside.</t5902> <t5903>The only thing is, Jim is too old and weak to dig his way out with a knife.</t5903> <t5904>He won't live to see that day!</t5904>
<t5905>- Yes, it's possible to live.</t5905> <t5906>You probably think it would take thirty-seven years to dig through this foundation, don't you?</t5906>
<t5907>- So how long does it take?</t5907>
<t5908>- We can't let it drag on for too long, because if it takes too long, Uncle Silas down in New Orleans might hear that Jim is no longer there and make a fuss.</t5908> <t5909>Exactly, we would need several years, but we can't do that.</t5909> <t5910>So, we dig straight in, dig really fast, then we leave it and just think that we've been digging for thirty-seven years.</t5910> <t5911>Then we pull him out, and when there's an alarm, we push him away immediately.</t5911> <t5912>In my opinion, that's the best way.</t5912>
<t5913>- Yeah, what you said sounds reasonable.</t5913> <t5914>Imagining it doesn't cause any trouble anyway.</t5914> <t5915>You can imagine that you'll dig for a hundred and ten years if you want.</t5915> <t5916>Alright, let me go get a few knives.</t5916>
<t5917>It said:</t5917>
<t5918>- Take three back, I need one to make a saw.</t5918>
<t5919>I said:</t5919>
<t5920>- Tom, if you don't give it to me, it's against the rules, then I'll tell you there's a rusty saw blade stuck on the roof behind the kitchen.</t5920>
<t5921>It seemed bored and disappointed, and replied to me:</t5921>
<t5922>- I don't know how to teach you anymore.</t5922> <t5923>Just go and bring back three knives, remember, three of them.</t5923>
<t5924>So I ran away.</t5924>
<t5925>Chapter XXXVI</t5925>
<t5926>That night, we waited until everyone had gone to sleep, then climbed down the lamppost, ran to the porch, took out the fireflies, and began our work.</t5926> <t5927>We moved all the clutter away, clearing an area of about a meter in the middle of the ground.</t5927> <t5928>Tom said that spot was right behind Jim's bed, and we would dig from there into the cell.</t5928> <t5929>Once we dug through, no one on the other side would know there was a hole because the bedspread of Jim's bed hung down close to the ground; you would have to lift it up and look down to see the hole.</t5929> <t5930>So we took out our daggers and dug, digging until nearly midnight.</t5930> <t5931>Eventually, we were exhausted, our hands blistered, and still, we hadn't made much progress.</t5931> <t5932>Finally, I said:</t5932>
<t5933>- Tom Sawyer, this is not a thirty-seven-year job, but a thirty-eight-year job.</t5933>
<t5934>It didn't say anything but just sighed, then after a moment, it stopped digging.</t5934> <t5935>I knew what it was thinking.</t5935> <t5936>It said:</t5936>
<t5937>- It's useless, Huck.</t5937> <t5938>Doing it this way won't get us anywhere.</t5938> <t5939>If we were prisoners, we could take as many years as we wanted, no need to hurry, just spend a few minutes each day digging.</t5939> <t5940>But we don't have that much time.</t5940> <t5941>If we plan to do another night like this, we would need to rest for a week to let our hands heal, otherwise, we won't be able to hold the knife to dig right away.</t5941>
<t5942>- So what should we do, Tom?</t5942>
<t5943>Let me tell you something.</t5943> <t5944>I don't want to give up, because that would be wrong and unethical.</t5944> <t5945>But the only way left is for us to dig with a hoe and put the knife away.</t5945>
<t5946>I said:</t5946>
<t5947>- See that?</t5947> <t5948>Your mind is clearer now, Tom Sawyer.</t5948> <t5949>Whether it's moral or not, using a hoe is still right.</t5949> <t5950>When I set out to steal a black man, or a watermelon, or a book from the monastery school, I don't care whether it's moral or not.</t5950> <t5951>What I need is my black man, what I need is my watermelon, or what I need is the book from the monastery school, and if the hoe is the most convenient, then I use the hoe.</t5951> <t5952>I take the hoe to dig out that black man, that watermelon, or that book, and I don't give a damn about what the reputable people think about it!</t5952>
<t5953>It says</t5953>
<t5954>- In this case, using a hoe and discarding the knife is also acceptable.</t5954> <t5955>If not, then I wouldn't accept that and would definitely not stand still and watch the rules being distorted.</t5955> <t5956>For you, you can use the hoe instead of the knife without any hesitation because you have no other choice.</t5956> <t5957>But I'm different because I know better ways.</t5957> <t5958>Give me the knife!</t5958>
<t5959>It was already holding a knife, but I still handed it my knife.</t5959> <t5960>It threw it down and said:</t5960>
<t5961>- Give me the knife.</t5961>
<t5962>I didn't know what to do, but then I figured it out.</t5962> <t5963>I rummaged through the old stuff, took out a hoe, and handed it to him.</t5963> <t5964>He took it and started working without saying anything.</t5964>
<t5965>It's still the same, very principled.</t5965>
<t5966>I picked up a shovel, and both of us toiled for half an hour and dug a fairly large hole.</t5966> <t5967>When I went upstairs and looked out the window, I saw Tom trying hard to climb the lamp post again, but he couldn't manage it because his hands were too sore.</t5967> <t5968>Finally, he said:</t5968>
<t5969>- It's useless, we can't climb.</t5969> <t5970>Do you have any other way?</t5970>
<t5971>- Yes, but I'm afraid you might say it's not according to the rules.</t5971> <t5972>You should take the stairs up.</t5972>
<t5973>So it did as I told it to.</t5973>
<t5974>The next day, Tom stole a tin spoon and a brass candlestick from the house to make a pen for Jim, along with six tallow candles.</t5974> <t5975>As for me, I went down to the black people's quarters to find an opportunity to steal three iron plates.</t5975> <t5976>Tom said that wasn't enough.</t5976> <t5977>But I thought no one would see the plates Jim threw out.</t5977> <t5978>That way, we could pick them up and use them again.</t5978> <t5979>Tom agreed. He said:</t5979>
<t5980>- Now, how to get those things to Jim.</t5980>
<t5981>I said:</t5981>
<t5982>- Now that we've finished digging, we can put it in that hole.</t5982>
<t5983>It seemed to not accept my opinion and was deep in thought.</t5983> <t5984>A moment later, it said it had found two or three ways, but there was no need to decide on any of them yet.</t5984> <t5985>First of all, we must inform Jim.</t5985>
<t5986>That night, around ten o'clock, we climbed down the lamp post again, bringing a candle with us, and listened at the window hole to hear Jim snoring.</t5986> <t5987>We threw the candle in, but Jim still didn't wake up.</t5987> <t5988>We then started digging and shoveling the earth, and after about two and a half hours, we were completely done.</t5988> <t5989>We crawled under Jim's bed into the cell, found the candle, lit it, and stood looking at Jim for a while.</t5989> <t5990>He was still as gentle and healthy as usual.</t5990> <t5991>We gently shook him awake.</t5991> <t5992>Seeing us, Jim was overjoyed, almost crying, and called us with all the affectionate names he could think of.</t5992> <t5993>He wanted us to find a piece of iron to saw off the chain on his leg and then escape immediately, without delay.</t5993> <t5994>But Tom thought that wasn't according to the rules and sat down to tell Jim a series of plans.</t5994> <t5995>Jim happily agreed. Tom also asked Jim a lot of questions.</t5995> <t5996>Jim said that Mr. Silas came to pray with him every few days, and Aunt Sally also came to check if he was eating well and properly, and that both of them were kind to him.</t5996>
<t5997>Tom said:</t5997>
<t5998>- Alright, we will send you the items through them.</t5998>
<t5999>I said:</t5999>
<t6000>- Don't do that, I've never seen anyone so foolish before.</t6000>
<t6001>But Tom didn't bother to listen.</t6001> <t6002>When he already had an intention in his mind, he always did things that way.</t6002>
<t6003>It told Jim that we would secretly slip the rope ladder and many other things into a cake brought by Nat, the black man who still brought food for Jim.</t6003> <t6004>It also reminded Jim not to let Nat see him open those things.</t6004> <t6005>But the small items, we would put them in Uncle Silas's coat pocket and Jim had to steal them from there; we would tie the odds and ends to Aunt Sally's apron strings or put them in her kitchen apron pocket, if there was an opportunity, and tell Jim what those things were for.</t6005> <t6006>Then it told Jim how to use his blood to write a diary on the shirt, etc...</t6006> <t6007>Although Jim didn't understand anything, Tom said that white people should know more than Jim. So Jim agreed and said he would follow everything Tom told him.</t6007>
<t6008>Jim has many wooden pipes, and also tobacco.</t6008> <t6009>So we sat down and had a very pleasant conversation.</t6009> <t6010>After that, we crawled back through the hole and returned to the sleeping quarters.</t6010> <t6011>Our hands were all bruised, but Tom was very pleased.</t6011> <t6012>He said it was the most interesting and clever game, and he wished to continue it for the rest of his life, even extending eighty years into the future, to the time of our grandchildren.</t6012> <t6013>And surely we would become famous figures.</t6013>
<t6014>In the morning, we went to the woodpile and chopped the brass candlestick into several pieces, then Tim put them into his pocket along with some spoons.</t6014> <t6015>We went down to the black people's house; while I distracted Nat, Tom slipped a piece of the candlestick into the bread in the pot of food meant for Jim and then followed Nat.</t6015> <t6016>When Jim bit into the bread, it felt like his teeth were going to break.</t6016> <t6017>Jim didn't complain, he just said that it was a common grit that often got mixed into the bread.</t6017> <t6018>After that, Jim didn't bite directly into the bread anymore but used a fork to poke three or four spots to check first.</t6018>
<t6019>While we were standing in the dim light, suddenly two dogs crawled out from under Jim's bed, followed by others one after another, making a total of eleven dogs crowding the entire room.</t6019> <t6020>Oh no, we forgot to lock the door.</t6020> <t6021>The black man Nat only had time to shout "Ghost!" before he staggered and collapsed on the floor, groaning as if he were about to die.</t6021> <t6022>Tom forcefully pushed the door open, threw a piece of meat from Jim's food supply outside, and the pack of dogs rushed out.</t6022> <t6023>Tom ran out after them, then came back and did not forget to close the door.</t6023> <t6024>Tom sweetly coaxed the black man and asked him what he had seen.</t6024> <t6025>He sat up, blinked for a while, and said:</t6025>
<t6026>- Sid, you might think I'm crazy, but I really just saw a million dogs, or demons, or something.</t6026> <t6027>I thought I could die right then and there.</t6027> <t6028>I was so scared, they all jumped at me.</t6028> <t6029>But at that moment, I couldn't do anything.</t6029> <t6030>I just wanted them to leave me alone.</t6030>
<t6031>Tom said:</t6031>
<t6032>- Ah, simple.</t6032> <t6033>They came in here again while this black man on the run was having breakfast because they were hungry, maybe.</t6033> <t6034>You have to make a separate cake for the devil.</t6034>
<t6035>- Oh, Sid, I don't know what cakes for ghosts are.</t6035> <t6036>I've never heard of that before.</t6036>
<t6037>- Then let me do it.</t6037>
<t6038>- That's very kind.</t6038> <t6039>I will kneel down at your feet and bow.</t6039>
<t6040>- Because you were kind enough to show us the runaway black man.</t6040> <t6041>But you must be very careful.</t6041> <t6042>When we put it in the pot, you must not look into it.</t6042> <t6043>When Jim takes the food out of the pot, you must not look, and especially not touch it, in case something happens, I won't know what to do.</t6043>
<t6044>- Not allowed to touch?</t6044> <t6045>Then even if you give me millions of dollars, I wouldn't bother touching it.</t6045>
<t6046>Chapter XXXVII</t6046>
<t6047>Everything was already arranged.</t6047> <t6048>We went to the pile of trash in the backyard, rummaged around, and found an old tin washbasin, patched up the holes to steal some flour and fill it up.</t6048> <t6049>After that, we went back to the house, had breakfast, and picked up a few boat nails.</t6049> <t6050>Tom said those were very good for prisoners to use to write their names and their sufferings on the prison bed.</t6050> <t6051>We put one nail into Aunt Sally's kitchen apron pocket hanging on the chair, and the other nail into Uncle Silas's hatband on the desk, because we heard the kids say their parents would visit the runaway slave this morning.</t6051> <t6052>I also put a spoon into Uncle Silas's outer coat pocket.</t6052> <t6053>Aunt Sally hadn't arrived yet, so we had to wait for a while.</t6053>
<t6054>A moment later, Aunt Saly arrived, her face flushed red.</t6054> <t6055>One hand pouring coffee, the other knocking on the head of the nearest child, and said:</t6055>
<t6056>- I searched all over the house but couldn't find a single shirt.</t6056>
<t6057>My heart seemed to drop, the piece of cake stuck in my throat and caused a cough, the piece of cake shot out, flew across the table, hit the eye of the child sitting in front of me, and stuck there.</t6057> <t6058>The child let out a scream.</t6058> <t6059>As for Tom, his face turned pale for a moment, but then returned to normal.</t6059> <t6060>Then another event made us all shiver.</t6060> <t6061>Uncle Silas said:</t6061>
<t6062>- Strange, I clearly remember taking off my shirt because...</t6062>
<t6063>- I know you took it off, because yesterday it was still on the clothesline, I saw it myself.</t6063> <t6064>But now it's gone.</t6064> <t6065>Just go get another shirt to wear, and I'll make you a new one.</t6065> <t6066>You must take better care of your clothes.</t6066>
<t6067>- I know, Saly, but that is not entirely my fault.</t6067> <t6068>I haven't seen that shirt except when I wear it, and if I wear it, there's no reason for it to get lost.</t6068>
<t6069>- Well, it's not your fault if you don't know.</t6069> <t6070>And it's not just about losing one shirt.</t6070> <t6071>That's not all.</t6071> <t6072>Ten spoons, now there are nine.</t6072> <t6073>Maybe the calf took the shirt, but a calf would never take a spoon.</t6073> <t6074>That's for sure.</t6074>
<t6075>- What else is lost, Saly?</t6075>
<t6076>- Six more candles are missing, it could be that mice took them away.</t6076> <t6077>But I don't understand how they got in, because you always seal the holes, and they shouldn't be able to get in.</t6077> <t6078>If they could get in, they might even crawl into your hair while you sleep.</t6078>
<t6079>- Alright, I know it's my fault.</t6079> <t6080>I've been too careless lately, starting tomorrow I won't leave any gaps unfilled.</t6080>
<t6081>- Oh, there's no rush, next year is fine...</t6081>
<t6082>The sound of a hand slapping the table, the child who was dipping their finger into the sugar bowl quickly pulled it out.</t6082> <t6083>At that moment, a black woman walked in and said:</t6083>
<t6084>- Madam, a bedsheet is also missing.</t6084>
<t6085>- Missing bed sheet!</t6085> <t6086>How strange?</t6086>
<t6087>Uncle Silas with a sad expression:</t6087>
<t6088>- I will go and seal the holes today.</t6088>
<t6089>- Stop it, sir.</t6089> <t6090>What mouse would carry off a bedsheet?</t6090> <t6091>Where did it go missing? Lize!</t6091>
<t6092>- Madam, I don't know.</t6092> <t6093>Yesterday, it was still on the clothesline, but now it's gone, no longer there.</t6093>
<t6094>- This is complete chaos.</t6094> <t6095>I've never seen anything like this before, from childhood until now, shirts, then bed sheets; then spoons; then...</t6095>
<t6096>A boy walked in from somewhere:</t6096>
<t6097>- Madam, another brass candlestick is missing.</t6097>
<t6098>- Get out of here, you damn idiot, or I'll beat you up right now.</t6098>
<t6099>Aunt Saly was boiling with anger.</t6099> <t6100>I sat silently praying, planning to sneak outside to go into the forest and wait until the atmosphere calmed down a bit.</t6100> <t6101>Everyone was silent, fearful.</t6101> <t6102>Finally, Uncle Silas was dumbfounded to find the spoon in his pocket.</t6102> <t6103>Aunt Saly stood still, raised her hand, and opened her mouth wide.</t6103> <t6104>As for me, I just wanted to sink into the ground.</t6104> <t6105>Aunt Saly said:</t6105>
<t6106>- I knew it right away.</t6106> <t6107>So you still kept it in your coat pocket.</t6107> <t6108>There might even be other things in that pocket too.</t6108> <t6109>How did it get in there?</t6109>
<t6110>- I really don't know.</t6110> <t6111>Maybe while having breakfast, because I was so engrossed in reading the Bible, I put the spoon in my pocket thinking it was the holy book.</t6111> <t6112>Let me go check if the Bible is still there or not.</t6112> <t6113>Maybe I put the Bible down and picked up the spoon, and...</t6113>
<t6114>- Oh no, everyone please go away, don't let anyone come near me while I'm in a rage.</t6114>
<t6115>If she had only whispered to herself, I would have heard it already, let alone shouting like this; even if I were dead, I would have risen to listen.</t6115> <t6116>We walked past the bedroom and saw my uncle putting away his hat, the boat nail stuck in his hat fell to the floor.</t6116> <t6117>He just quietly picked it up and placed it on the coat rack, said nothing, and walked out.</t6117> <t6118>Seeing that, Tom remembered the spoon.</t6118> <t6119>He said:</t6119>
<t6120>- Well, maybe we can't trust him to send things through him anymore.</t6120> <t6121>But he did us a favor regarding the spoon that the other guy didn't know about, so we should thank him by sealing up the mouse holes.</t6121>
<t6122>In the basement, there were many rat holes, so it took us an hour to seal them all, but we did it very carefully.</t6122> <t6123>Suddenly, there were footsteps on the stairs, and we quickly turned off the lights and hid. Uncle Silas came, holding a candle in one hand and some tools in the other, looking dazed.</t6123> <t6124>He went around from one rat hole to another.</t6124> <t6125>Then he stood up and paused for a few minutes, thinking.</t6125> <t6126>He walked towards the stairs in a trance, mumbling:</t6126>
<t6127>- I don't remember when I plugged these holes.</t6127> <t6128>I have to go tell Saly right now, and that way I won't be blamed for the mice.</t6128> <t6129>But never mind, saying it wouldn't help anyway.</t6129>
<t6130>As he just went up the stairs, we sneaked out after him.</t6130> <t6131>He is always nice.</t6131>
<t6132>Tom was very worried about how to get a spoon.</t6132> <t6133>After thinking for a while, he told me what to do now.</t6133> <t6134>We went to wait at the place where the spoon basket was until Aunt Saly arrived.</t6134> <t6135>Tom counted the spoons and set one aside, then slipped one into his sleeve.</t6135> <t6136>Then Tom said:</t6136>
<t6137>- Saly, there are only nine spoons here.</t6137>
<t6138>She said:</t6138>
<t6139>- Please, don't bother your aunt anymore.</t6139> <t6140>Your aunt knows already, she counted it herself.</t6140>
<t6141>- Auntie, I counted twice and still only see nine.</t6141>
<t6142>She seemed to be unable to bear the impatience any longer, but she counted again.</t6142> <t6143>After finishing counting, she said:</t6143>
<t6144>- There really are only nine - How strange, let me count again.</t6144>
<t6145>I gently let go of the spoon I was holding, then only spoke after she finished counting:</t6145>
<t6146>- Here are ten!</t6146>
<t6147>She was both delighted and worried.</t6147> <t6148>But then Tom said:</t6148>
<t6149>- No, auntie, how could there be ten?</t6149>
<t6150>- Didn't you see that I just counted?</t6150>
<t6151>- I know, but...</t6151>
<t6152>- Okay, count again.</t6152>
<t6153>I counted again, and after finishing, I still only saw nine like before.</t6153> <t6154>That made her so angry she was about to go crazy.</t6154> <t6155>But she kept counting over and over, counting inside the basket and then outside the basket, sometimes it was enough, sometimes it was missing.</t6155> <t6156>Too frustrated, she grabbed the spoon basket and threw it into the corner of the house, hitting the cat lying there, and then yelled at us to get out so she could have some peace.</t6156> <t6157>So we took the spoon and put it into her kitchen apron pocket while she was shouting at us to leave.</t6157> <t6158>By near noon, Jim had received both the spoon and the nail.</t6158> <t6159>We found the whole thing very amusing.</t6159> <t6160>He said that after she counted like that for three more days, she would give up, and if anyone asked her to count again, she might even kill them.</t6160>
<t6161>That night, we again hung the bed sheet over the wire as usual and stole another one from the closet.</t6161> <t6162>Then we left it, then took it away, repeatedly for several days, until she no longer knew how many sheets there were and didn't bother to count them anymore.</t6162> <t6163>Now we were at ease. At ease about the shirt, the sheet, and the candles, thanks to the story of the little girl, the mouse, and the mixed-up counting, but nothing was mentioned about the brass candlestick.</t6163> <t6164>But surely it would come out eventually.</t6164>
<t6165>But making the cake was really a whole project.</t6165> <t6166>We encountered one difficulty after another before we could finish that cake.</t6166> <t6167>We took it into the forest, cooked it there, and were very pleased when it was done. But it wasn't something that could be done in a single day.</t6167> <t6168>We had to use three bowls full of dough, got burns all over our bodies, and our eyes stung.</t6168> <t6169>Finally, we figured out that we had to stuff the entire rope ladder into the cake first.</t6169> <t6170>The next night, we crawled over to Jim's place, tore the bed sheet into small strips and twisted them together, and by dawn, we had made a very nice rope that could support the weight of a person.</t6170> <t6171>By late morning, we went out into the forest, but we couldn't fit it into the cake.</t6171> <t6172>A rope made from an entire bed sheet would require forty cakes to hold it all, and there would still be leftovers to put in soup and sauces.</t6172> <t6173>But we didn't need that.</t6173> <t6174>All that was necessary was to stuff enough into the cake, and we discarded the rest.</t6174> <t6175>We didn't cook anything in the bowl, for fear that the tin would melt.</t6175> <t6176>But Uncle Silas had a copper warming pan that we treasured, as it was an heirloom with a wooden handle, sent from England. He had hidden it in the attic along with a lot of jars, bottles, and other valuable items.</t6176>
<t6177>Actually, it is not highly valued, but because it is an antique, it is considered important.</t6177> <t6178>We took it out to the forest, the first cake we cooked got burnt, but the next one turned out fine.</t6178> <t6179>We took it out, cleaned it, rubbed it with flour, placed it on the charcoal stove, then added some scraps of paper, put a wet lump of dough, covered it, and put glowing charcoal on the lid.</t6179> <t6180>Then we stood more than a meter away, holding a long, cool handle, and fifteen minutes later, we had a very beautiful-looking cake.</t6180> <t6181>But anyone who eats that cake will suffer from a stomachache and be bedridden.</t6181>
<t6182>When we placed that devilish cake into the pot to bring it to Jim, Nat didn't dare to look.</t6182> <t6183>Then we put three iron plates at the bottom of the pot, beneath the other food.</t6183> <t6184>So Jim had everything he needed.</t6184> <t6185>As soon as he received those items, Jim immediately broke the cake to take the string and hid it in the straw, then made a few marks on the iron plates and threw them out through the window.</t6185>
<t6186>Chapter XXXVIII</t6186>
<t6187>Jim said that engraving was the hardest of all.</t6187> <t6188>But Tom insisted that Jim had to write.</t6188> <t6189>The prisoner had to leave his handwriting on the wall for posterity, along with his emblem.</t6189>
<t6190>Jim said:</t6190>
<t6191>- Uncle Tom, I don't have any personal badge at all, just this shirt you gave me and I have to write my diary on it.</t6191>
<t6192>- You don't understand anything, Jim, the badge is different, it's not like that.</t6192>
<t6193>I said:</t6193>
<t6194>- Jim is right.</t6194> <t6195>He doesn't have any badges.</t6195>
<t6196>Tom replied:</t6196>
<t6197>- I know, but Jim needs to have a badge before leaving this place.</t6197>
<t6198>So Tom sat down, wracking his brain to come up with a badge for Jim. After a while, he said he had thought of many but didn't know which one to choose.</t6198> <t6199>Finally, he picked one design and said:</t6199>
<t6200>- On that coat of arms, a circle is drawn around it, with a yellow cross in front, depicting a dog lying down, showing subservience, with a chain at the dog's feet, then a place to record achievements in green, with serrated edges, a green V shape at the top of the emblem, and three slanted lines on a blue background with many dots.</t6200> <t6201>A symbol of a black man running away carrying a bundle of luggage, and another symbol of two guys following to help, meaning you and me.</t6201>
<t6202>So it resolved the matter about the badge, now it was finishing the remaining part, which was to draft a farewell letter, saying that Jim must have such a letter, as it was mentioned in the book.</t6202> <t6203>It wrote it down on a piece of paper, then read it aloud:</t6203>
<t6204>1) Here, a captive heart is breaking.</t6204>
<t6205>2) Here, a pitiable prisoner, abandoned by life and friends, must live withering away, deteriorating.</t6205>
<t6206>3) Here, a lonely heart breaks, a spirit has grown weary after thirty-seven years of solitary confinement.</t6206>
<t6207>4) Here, the child of Louis the Fourteenth died homeless, without close friends, after thirty-seven years of imprisonment.</t6207>
<t6208>When reading those sentences, Tom's voice trembled with emotion.</t6208> <t6209>After finishing reading, he didn't know which sentence to choose for Jim to write on the wall because they all seemed good; in the end, he decided to let Jim write all of them.</t6209> <t6210>Jim said it would take him about a year to finish writing all those words, so Tom would write them outside, and Jim would just trace them on the wall.</t6210> <t6211>Then he said:</t6211>
<t6212>- Writing on wood won't work, because there are no wooden walls in the tower prison.</t6212> <t6213>We have to carve the letters into stone instead.</t6213>
<t6214>Jim said that carving on stone is even harder than on wood, so it would be a long time before he could finish and escape.</t6214> <t6215>But Tom said he would let me help.</t6215> <t6216>Then he looked to see how far Jim and I had written.</t6216> <t6217>Doing this was really a very difficult and slow task, my hands were already hurting and hurt even more, but the work seemed to make no progress.</t6217> <t6218>Tom said:</t6218>
<t6219>- I have an idea.</t6219> <t6220>We need to find a stone to make a badge and write on it. There is a large grinding stone in the workshop below, we will bring it up here and write things on it, and we can also use it to sharpen pens and saws.</t6220>
<t6221>It was a bizarre idea, but we thought we could do it.</t6221> <t6222>It wasn't yet midnight, we went outside and headed down to the workshop, leaving only Jim to do his work.</t6222> <t6223>We carried the stone outside and rolled it home, but it was so heavy, several times it almost crushed our feet.</t6223> <t6224>Tom said that someone was bound to have the stone fall on their foot before we got it home.</t6224> <t6225>Halfway there, we were exhausted, staggering, and drenched in sweat.</t6225> <t6226>We had to call Jim, Jim got up and unhooked the chain from the bedpost, crawled out of the hole to where the stone was, Jim and I lifted the stone, moving as if it were nothing, while Tom directed us.</t6226> <t6227>He could command any other kid.</t6227> <t6228>He could do all sorts of things.</t6228>
<t6229>The hole we dug was quite large, but the rock still couldn't fit through, so Jim took the pickaxe and dug it wider.</t6229> <t6230>Tom took a nail and marked the rock, telling Jim to chisel along the lines he had drawn.</t6230> <t6231>He told Jim to work until the candle went out, then hide the rock under the bed and sleep on top of it.</t6231> <t6232>We helped Jim reattach the chain to the bed leg, then we also prepared to go to sleep.</t6232> <t6233>But suddenly, Tom said:</t6233>
<t6234>- Are there any spiders in here, Jim?</t6234>
<t6235>- No, there isn't, buddy.</t6235>
<t6236>- Okay, let me go get some for you.</t6236>
<t6237>- Oh, I'm very scared.</t6237> <t6238>I'd rather have snakes than spiders.</t6238>
<t6239>Tom thought for a few minutes and then said:</t6239>
<t6240>- A good idea.</t6240> <t6241>So where did you put it?</t6241>
<t6242>- What to leave, Tom?</t6242>
<t6243>- A snake, what else?</t6243>
<t6244>- My God, if a snake crawls in here, I will immediately have to squeeze through that hole in the wall and run away.</t6244>
<t6245>- Oh, Jim, don't be so scared.</t6245> <t6246>Can you conquer it?</t6246>
<t6247>- Conquer?</t6247>
<t6248>- Yes, it's easy.</t6248> <t6249>Any animal that you love will be grateful and will never harm you.</t6249> <t6250>Just try it.</t6250> <t6251>Then it might let you wrap it around your neck and even tuck its head into your mouth.</t6251>
<t6252>- I beg you, I don't dare to listen! Will it let me put its head into my mouth?</t6252> <t6253>Never.</t6253> <t6254>Moreover, I don't want it to sleep with me.</t6254>
<t6255>- Jim, don't be so foolish.</t6255> <t6256>A prisoner must have an animal to befriend.</t6256> <t6257>Until now, no one has ever kept a snake, so being the first to do so would be even more glorious.</t6257>
<t6258>- Tom, I don't want that glory.</t6258> <t6259>The snake will bite me.</t6259> <t6260>No, I don't want to do that.</t6260>
<t6261>- Damn it, can't you just try it? I just want you to try it.</t6261> <t6262>If you don't like it, you don't have to keep it forever!</t6262>
<t6263>- But while I was trying, it bit me already.</t6263> <t6264>Tom, I don't want to do those things.</t6264> <t6265>If Huck brings a snake in here, I'll leave immediately, definitely.</t6265>
<t6266>- Well, never mind then.</t6266> <t6267>We'll find you a few non-venomous snakes instead.</t6267>
<t6268>- I can't stand it either, Tom.</t6268> <t6269>I'm telling you the truth, I've never felt so worried and miserable like this.</t6269>
<t6270>- So, are there any mice here?</t6270>
<t6271>- No, I didn't see any.</t6271>
<t6272>- Well, then we'll find you some mice...</t6272>
<t6273>- I don't need mice, Tom.</t6273> <t6274>They are the most annoying creatures, always bothering people, climbing on them, biting their feet and preventing them from sleeping.</t6274> <t6275>I'd rather you put in regular snakes than bring mice in here.</t6275> <t6276>I have no use for mice.</t6276>
<t6277>- But you must have mice.</t6277> <t6278>Don't worry, everyone does it that way.</t6278> <t6279>Prisoners never have mice, they train them with many tricks, and then those mice become as familiar as flies.</t6279> <t6280>And you also have to play music for them. Do you have anything to play music with?</t6280>
<t6281>- I only have a broken comb and a piece of paper to make a plucking instrument.</t6281> <t6282>But I am sure they don't like plucking instruments.</t6282>
<t6283>- Yes, they do. They don't differentiate between types of music.</t6283> <t6284>Plucking the zither is good enough for the mice.</t6284> <t6285>All animals like music, and in prison, they like it even more, especially sad music.</t6285> <t6286>The mice love it.</t6286> <t6287>They will come out to see what strange thing you have.</t6287> <t6288>At night, before going to sleep, and early in the morning when you wake up, you have to sit on the bed for a while and play that zither.</t6288> <t6289>If you play for about two minutes, you will see all kinds of mice, snakes, spiders, etc., feeling sad for you and gathering around you.</t6289>
<t6290>-Yes, I think so too.</t6290> <t6291>But right now I don't understand anything, I will try to follow if I have to.</t6291> <t6292>I will make those animals satisfied and there will be no trouble in the house.</t6292>
<t6293>Tom thought for a moment longer to see if there was anything else, then he said:</t6293>
<t6294>- There is one more thing I forgot.</t6294> <t6295>Can you leave the flowers here?</t6295>
<t6296>- I don't know, but maybe.</t6296> <t6297>But it's very dark in here, and I don't need flowers, it just adds more trouble.</t6297>
<t6298>- You should give it a try.</t6298> <t6299>The other prisoners also grow flowers.</t6299>
<t6300>- here you can probably see cattail flowers, but planting them is not worth the effort.</t6300>
<t6301>- Don't think that way.</t6301> <t6302>We will find you a sapling, and you will plant it in that corner of the house over there.</t6302> <t6303>Don't call it a cat's tail flower, you must call it Pitchiola.</t6303> <t6304>And you must water it with tears.</t6304>
<t6305>- What's wrong? I have plenty of rainwater here.</t6305>
<t6306>- You cannot water it with rainwater, you must water it with tears.</t6306> <t6307>Everyone does it that way.</t6307>
<t6308>- Uncle Tom, then that flower will surely die, because I rarely cry.</t6308>
<t6309>Tom was at a loss for words.</t6309> <t6310>But after a moment of thinking, he told Jim to rub an onion in his eyes to produce tears.</t6310> <t6311>He promised to pick an onion and secretly put it into Jim's coffee pot in the morning. Jim said that would make the coffee smell like onions, and then Jim complained about Tom's plans, such as planting cattail flowers, playing music for the mice, petting snakes and spiders, sharpening pencils, carving letters into stone, writing a diary, and so on. It was really troublesome and annoying.</t6311> <t6312>He talked for a while, making Tom discouraged. Tom said that he had come up with all those things just to make Jim famous, but Jim's complaints made it all seem like a waste of effort.</t6312> <t6313>Hearing that, Jim felt regretful and promised not to behave that way anymore.</t6313> <t6314>After that, Tom and I went back to our room to sleep.</t6314>
<t6315>Chapter XXXIX</t6315>
<t6316>The next morning, we went to the village to buy a mouse trap and then brought it down to the house.</t6316> <t6317>Within about an hour, we had caught up to fifteen big ones.</t6317> <t6318>Then we carefully stored them under Aunt Saly's bed.</t6318> <t6319>But while we were out looking for spiders, little Tomas Phelps saw the mouse trap there and opened it to take a look.</t6319> <t6320>All the mice ran out in a frenzy, just as Aunt Saly walked in.</t6320> <t6321>When we got back, we saw her standing on the bed, screaming loudly, while the mice were running for their lives.</t6321> <t6322>She took a stick and gave the two of us a good beating.</t6322>
<t6323>We caught a bunch of spiders, bedbugs, frogs, and insects; we even wanted to take a hornet's nest, but we didn't succeed.</t6323> <t6324>The whole family of hornets was still in the nest.</t6324> <t6325>We kept waiting, intending to tire them out and then catch them.</t6325> <t6326>But instead, we went looking for snakes and caught a few dozen grass snakes, put them in a bag, and brought them back to the room.</t6326> <t6327>Just then, it was time for dinner.</t6327> <t6328>But the bag wasn't tied tightly at the top, so the snakes all crawled out.</t6328> <t6329>Every now and then, a snake would fall from the ceiling.</t6329> <t6330>And it would fall into the food dish, onto our backs, or onto our necks.</t6330> <t6331>Each one looked beautiful, but it was different for Aunt Saly.</t6331> <t6332>She was terribly disgusted by snakes.</t6332> <t6333>Every time a snake fell, she would scream and run away.</t6333> <t6334>I've never seen a woman so afraid of snakes.</t6334> <t6335>It took about a week for all the snakes to leave the house.</t6335> <t6336>Aunt Saly was still scared.</t6336> <t6337>It's really strange, but Tom said that all women are like that.</t6337>
<t6338>Every time a snake crawled past her place, we would get a beating.</t6338> <t6339>I wasn't afraid of the beatings because they didn't hurt at all.</t6339> <t6340>I just dreaded having to catch more snakes.</t6340> <t6341>I've never seen a room as lively as Jim's when all those creatures crawled out to listen to the music and gathered around Jim. Jim couldn't even blink in peace; when the snakes slept, the mice would come out, and when the mice went back in, the snakes would come out to stand guard, so there was always a group at his feet and another at his head. When Jim tried to find another place to lie down, the spiders would crawl over.</t6341> <t6342>He said if he got out this time, he would never want to be a prisoner again, even if they paid him.</t6342>
<t6343>Three weeks later, everything was fine.</t6343> <t6344>The shirt had been brought in first, each time a rat bit it, Jim would get up and write a line in the diary; when the ink was still wet, the pen was done, the letters and symbols were engraved on the grindstone; the bed legs had been sawed in half, and we had to eat all the sawdust.</t6344> <t6345>After finishing that, we had such severe stomachaches that we thought we were going to die.</t6345> <t6346>Uncle Silas had written several letters to the plantation down in Orleans to inform them to send someone to take the black man back, but there was no reply, because there was no such plantation down there.</t6346> <t6347>Finally, he said he would post a notice about Jim in the St. Louis and Orleans newspapers.</t6347> <t6348>When he mentioned St. Louis, it made me shiver all over.</t6348> <t6349>At that moment, Tom decided to write an anonymous letter.</t6349>
<t6350>- What is it? - I asked.</t6350>
<t6351>- It's to let people know what's happening.</t6351> <t6352>In the past, when Louis XVI planned to escape from prison, there was a maid who did that.</t6352> <t6353>Usually, the mother of the prisoner would exchange clothes with her child; the mother would stay behind, while the child would disguise themselves in the mother's clothes to escape.</t6353> <t6354>We will do the same.</t6354>
<t6355>- But we have to inform them.</t6355> <t6356>Whoever knows, let them be.</t6356>
<t6357>- I know already, but if we don't inform them, then no one and nothing will interfere with us.</t6357> <t6358>So all the hard and difficult work has no value, no meaning at all?</t6358><t6359>?</t6359>
<t6360>- I like it that way.</t6360>
<t6361>It looked at me with disdain.</t6361>
<t6362>- Don't speak anymore, please.</t6362>
<t6363>I said:</t6363>
<t6364>I don't object, you can do it however you want.</t6364> <t6365>So where did you find that maid?</t6365>
<t6366>- You will be the maid.</t6366> <t6367>In the middle of the night, you sneak in and put on that yellow dress.</t6367>
<t6368>- That's fine, but if I'm wearing my clothes like this, I can still deliver the letter, can't I?</t6368>
<t6369>- In that case, you won't be a close maid anymore.</t6369>
<t6370>- But who is looking at me?</t6370>
<t6371>- It's okay.</t6371> <t6372>I'm doing this because it's my duty, not because I worry about whether anyone sees me or not.</t6372> <t6373>Don't you understand anything?</t6373>
<t6374>- Alright, I am the maid, so who is Jim's mother?</t6374>
<t6375>- I am Jim's mother. I will wear Aunt Saly's shirt.</t6375>
<t6376>- Alright, so when Jim and I escape, you have to stay behind in that prison cell.</t6376>
<t6377>- It's not just that.</t6377> <t6378>I will stuff straw into Jim's clothes and put it on the bed to pretend to be his mother.</t6378> <t6379>Jim will wear Aunt Sally's clothes that I bring, and the three of us will escape together.</t6379> <t6380>When a famous prisoner escapes, it's called a jailbreak.</t6380>
<t6381>Then Tom wrote an anonymous letter, and that night I put on a woman's yellow dress, took the anonymous letter, and slipped it under the door, just as Tom instructed.</t6381>
<t6382>The letter says:</t6382>
<t6383>Attention: Something big is about to happen.</t6383> <t6384>Pay close attention.</t6384>
<t6385>The anonymous friend.</t6385>
<t6386>The next night, we pasted a picture that Tom drew, with blood, of a human skull with two crossed bones on the front door.</t6386> <t6387>And the following night, we pasted another picture on the back door, this time of a coffin.</t6387> <t6388>The whole family was terrified.</t6388> <t6389>The door slamming shut even startled Aunt Saly.</t6389> <t6390>She was too scared to sleep but didn't say anything.</t6390> <t6391>So the plan was going very well.</t6391> <t6392>Early the next morning, just as dawn was breaking, we finished writing another letter and marveled at how clever we were.</t6392> <t6393>By dinner time, they said that the black men would stand guard all night at both the front and back doors of the house.</t6393> <t6394>Tom slid down the lamp post, pasted the letter on the back of one of the black men, and climbed back up.</t6394> <t6395>The letter read as follows:</t6395>
<t6396>"Do not betray me, I want to be your friend.</t6396> <t6397>Currently, there is a very dangerous gang of murderers who will steal your runaway black man, and they advise you not to stop them.</t6397> <t6398>I am one of them, but I want to leave them and live an honest life, so I want to inform you.</t6398> <t6399>They will come down from the North, through the fence, at exactly midnight, carrying a fake key to enter the black man's room and steal him away.</t6399> <t6400>I will stand nearby, if I see any danger, I will blow a whistle.</t6400> <t6401>When they get close, I will not blow the whistle but will bleat like a sheep.</t6401> <t6402>Then, while they are unchaining him, you should come and lock them inside and you can kill them however you wish.</t6402> <t6403>Do not do anything other than what I have told you above; otherwise, they will suspect something and will howl to call the whole gang to rescue them.</t6403> <t6404>I do not ask for any reward, but just know that I have done a righteous deed."</t6404>
<t6405>The Anonymous Friend</t6405>
<t6406>chapter xl</t6406>
<t6407>After breakfast, we felt refreshed and went to the river to pull up the boat and then went fishing, bringing along lunch as well.</t6407> <t6408>It wasn't until nearly evening that we returned, finding the whole family very worried. After dinner, they urged us to go to bed, but halfway up the stairs, seeing Aunt Saly had already turned away, we sneaked down to the cupboard to grab some cold food and dollars, brought them back to the room, and went to sleep until one-thirty.</t6408> <t6409>Tom wore Aunt Saly's dress that he had just stolen and took the food away.</t6409> <t6410>He told me:</t6410>
<t6411>- Where is the butter?</t6411>
<t6412>- I put a big piece into the bread already.</t6412>
<t6413>- Why isn't there?</t6413>
<t6414>- It's okay without butter.</t6414>
<t6415>- You go downstairs and get it.</t6415> <t6416>I'll go stuff straw into Jim's clothes to pretend to be his mother, then I'll be ready there to bleat like a sheep. As soon as you arrive, just come right in.</t6416>
<t6417>Then it went out, and I went down to the basement.</t6417> <t6418>I took a piece of bread, turned off the light, and sneaked through the lower house.</t6418> <t6419>Suddenly, Aunt Saly appeared holding a candle, and I quickly put the piece of bread into my hat and put it on my head.</t6419> <t6420>Seeing me, she asked:</t6420>
<t6421>- Did you come up from the basement?</t6421>
<t6422>- Yes... sir.</t6422>
<t6423>- What are you doing down there?</t6423>
<t6424>- Not doing anything, sir.</t6424>
<t6425>- Right?</t6425>
<t6426>- That's correct.</t6426>
<t6427>- So what are you going down there for in the middle of the night?</t6427>
<t6428>- Sir ... I don't know.</t6428>
<t6429>- Don't know?</t6429> <t6430>Don't answer me like that, Tom. I want to know what you were doing down there?</t6430>
<t6431>- I didn't do anything, Aunt Saly, I swear.</t6431>
<t6432>I thought she would let it go, because she usually did so.</t6432> <t6433>But perhaps lately there have been many unusual things happening in the house, so she pays attention to every little thing.</t6433> <t6434>She spoke very firmly.</t6434>
<t6435>- Go into the room and don't wait there.</t6435> <t6436>Let me see how things are first, then we'll talk.</t6436>
<t6437>- She left, and I opened the door and stepped into the living room.</t6437> <t6438>To my surprise, a crowd was in the room.</t6438> <t6439>Fifteen people were camping, each holding a gun in their hands.</t6439> <t6440>I plopped down.</t6440> <t6441>They were whispering to each other, everyone looking annoyed and uncomfortable, but still pretending as if nothing was wrong.</t6441> <t6442>But I knew, because I saw them repeatedly taking off and putting on their hats, standing up and sitting down, and fiddling with their coat buttons.</t6442> <t6443>I was also impatient, but I didn't take off my hat like they did.</t6443>
<t6444>I hope Aunt Sally comes to kick me out so I can run out and tell Tom that we have made too big a deal of it and now we have to run away with Jim before those people get angry and catch us, which would be disastrous.</t6444>
<t6445>Then a moment later, she came and asked me many questions, but I couldn't answer right away because I didn't know how to respond.</t6445> <t6446>But the other person was impatient and wanted to start immediately.</t6446> <t6447>They looked like they were going crazy.</t6447> <t6448>They said there were only a few minutes left until midnight.</t6448> <t6449>A few others said to wait, to listen for the bleat of the sheep as a signal.</t6449> <t6450>Meanwhile, Aunt Saly kept pressing me with questions, I was so scared that I started trembling and felt like I was about to collapse.</t6450> <t6451>The room was getting hotter by the minute.</t6451> <t6452>The butter in my hat began to melt, dripping down past my ears and running down my neck.</t6452> <t6453>Suddenly, someone said:</t6453>
<t6454>- Let me go there first, wait for them to arrive and then catch them.</t6454>
<t6455>I almost collapsed, a streak of butter running down my forehead.</t6455> <t6456>Aunt Saly saw it, her face turned pale, and she exclaimed:</t6456>
<t6457>-Oh my God, what's wrong with the boy?</t6457> <t6458>It looks like he has meningitis, his brain is leaking out here.</t6458>
<t6459>Everyone ran over to see.</t6459> <t6460>She lifted the hat off my head, the piece of cake fell down, and the remaining butter stuck to my head; then she grabbed me and shook me while saying:</t6460>
<t6461>- Oh, you scared me.</t6461> <t6462>It's really fortunate that it's not as bad as I thought.</t6462> <t6463>Why didn't you tell me right away to stop me from worrying?</t6463> <t6464>Now go to sleep, don't show your face here again from now until morning.</t6464>
<t6465>In just a second, I jumped upstairs, slid down the black pole, and slipped into the darkness heading towards the porch.</t6465> <t6466>I was so worried that I couldn't say anything more.</t6466> <t6467>But I quickly told Tom that he had to get out immediately, not to delay even a minute, as the house was full of people, and they were carrying guns.</t6467>
<t6468>Its face lit up, it asked:</t6468>
<t6469>- Oh, really? Huck, if we perform this trick again, I think we could draw up to two hundred people.</t6469> <t6470>How about we postpone until...</t6470>
<t6471>I interrupted it:</t6471>
<t6472>- We have to go right away.</t6472> <t6473>Where is Jim?</t6473>
<t6474>- Next to you, just reach out and you'll touch it.</t6474> <t6475>Jim has finished putting on his clothes.</t6475> <t6476>Now let's sneak outside and signal.</t6476>
<t6477>At that moment, we heard the sound of everyone's footsteps thundering, then the sound of a lock being opened, and someone said:</t6477>
<t6478>- I said it was still too early; they haven't arrived yet, the door is still locked.</t6478> <t6479>A few people went inside to hide in the dark, ready to kill them as soon as they arrived, while the others spread out a bit and listened carefully.</t6479>
<t6480>They stepped in, but in the darkness, they couldn't see us.</t6480> <t6481>They almost stepped on us while we were crawling under the bed.</t6481> <t6482>But we managed to crawl through and quietly slipped out.</t6482> <t6483>Jim went out first, then me.</t6483> <t6484>Tom went out last.</t6484> <t6485>That was according to Tom's orders. We crawled towards the door, Tom told us to stop and look through the crack of the door first, but it was too dark to see anything.</t6485> <t6486>He nudged Jim with his elbow to signal him to crawl forward.</t6486> <t6487>He went last.</t6487> <t6488>He then pressed his ear against the crack to listen, still hearing footsteps rustling outside.</t6488> <t6489>After that, he nudged us, and we crawled stealthily, holding our breath, without making a sound, and continued towards the fence like the Indians.</t6489> <t6490>Jim and I climbed over, but Tom got his clothes caught on the top of the post and was stuck there for a while.</t6490> <t6491>Suddenly, hearing footsteps approaching, he had to yank hard, breaking the post with a loud snap.</t6491> <t6492>He just managed to run after us when a voice shouted:</t6492>
<t6493>- Who's there?</t6493> <t6494>Answer quickly, or I'll shoot!</t6494>
<t6495>We didn't answer, just kept our heads down and ran.</t6495> <t6496>A group of people rushed over.</t6496> <t6497>Bang, bang, bang!</t6497> <t6498>Bullets whizzed around us.</t6498> <t6499>They shouted:</t6499>
<t6500>- Here they are!</t6500> <t6501>They're running to the riverbank!</t6501> <t6502>Brothers, chase after them.</t6502> <t6503>Release them quickly!</t6503>
<t6504>They rushed in.</t6504> <t6505>We could hear them clearly because they wore boots and shouted, while we neither wore boots nor shouted.</t6505> <t6506>We turned onto the small path leading to the workshop.</t6506> <t6507>When they ran close behind us, we stepped aside and hid in the bushes to let them pass, then stepped out and ran behind them.</t6507> <t6508>The dogs came running, barking loudly as if there were a million of them.</t6508> <t6509>We stood still, waiting for the dogs to reach us.</t6509> <t6510>They were all domestic dogs, so when they saw us, they wagged their tails happily and then ran ahead following the people who were rummaging and shouting.</t6510> <t6511>Then we turned back up towards the river, whistling casually behind them; we walked near the workshop and then turned into the bushes where my boat was tied.</t6511> <t6512>We all jumped into the boat and rowed to the middle of the river, trying not to make too much noise.</t6512> <t6513>So we rowed away, gently and comfortably, heading towards the island where I had hidden the raft.</t6513> <t6514>We could still hear people shouting and dogs barking along the riverbank.</t6514> <t6515>It wasn't until we had gone far that those sounds gradually faded and disappeared completely.</t6515> <t6516>Once on the raft, I said:</t6516>
<t6517>- Jim, you are free now, and you will probably never have to be a slave again.</t6517>
<t6518>We were all very delighted.</t6518> <t6519>But Tom was the most delighted because he got a bullet in his calf.</t6519>
<t6520>Jim and I heard it and couldn't be happy anymore.</t6520> <t6521>The wound hurt him a lot, and there was a lot of blood.</t6521> <t6522>We put him in the tent and tore one of the duke's shirts that was left there to bandage him.</t6522> <t6523>But he said:</t6523>
<t6524>- Let me do it.</t6524> <t6525>Don't stop here, that's the only way the escape will succeed.</t6525> <t6526>Let the raft go!</t6526> <t6527>We did it very skillfully, truly skillfully.</t6527> <t6528>I think we have the talent of Louis the Sixteenth, no, we have surpassed that.</t6528> <t6529>We did it as easily as playing.</t6529> <t6530>Alright, let's go, hurry up.</t6530>
<t6531>Jim and I looked at each other thoughtfully.</t6531> <t6532>A minute later, I said</t6532>
<t6533>- Jim, speak up!</t6533>
<t6534>Jim said:</t6534>
<t6535>- I think this way, Huck.</t6535> <t6536>Suppose you were the one being rescued, and one of your rescuers got injured, would you have the heart to leave that injured person to wait for death?</t6536> <t6537>Probably not!</t6537> <t6538>And Jim wouldn't do that either.</t6538> <t6539>If there is no doctor, Jim definitely won't leave this place even if he has to wait for forty more years.</t6539>
<t6540>I, Jim, am speaking very sincerely.</t6540> <t6541>I told Tom to let me go find a doctor.</t6541> <t6542>He insisted on not listening; but Jim and I also wouldn't give in.</t6542> <t6543>He tried to crawl out from the raft's side, but we didn't let him do that either.</t6543> <t6544>He grumbled for a while, then stopped.</t6544>
<t6545>Seeing that I had prepared the room, it said:</t6545>
<t6546>- Fine, if you are determined to go, I will tell you what needs to be done when you enter the village. You close the door, blindfold the doctor, and tie him up tightly. Tell him he must remain silent, then place a bundle of gold in his hand, take him through all the shortcuts and alleys in the dark, then lead him down to the boat and take a round trip around the islands.</t6546> <t6547>You must search all his pockets, not letting him keep a single piece of chalk, otherwise he will use the chalk to mark this raft and later find his way back.</t6547>
<t6548>I promise to do exactly that, while Jim must hide in the forest until he sees the doctor come and leave the raft before returning.</t6548>
<t6549>Chapter XLI</t6549>
<t6550>The doctor is an elderly person and seems kind.</t6550> <t6551>I woke him up and told him that my brother and I were on the Spanish island hunting since yesterday afternoon on a raft.</t6551> <t6552>In the middle of the night, unfortunately, I accidentally pulled the trigger while dreaming.</t6552> <t6553>The gun went off and hit my leg.</t6553> <t6554>So I invited the doctor to come and treat it, and not to say anything about this, not to let anyone know, because tonight we want to return home and surprise our family.</t6554> <t6555>He asked:</t6555>
<t6556>- Who are your family members?</t6556>
<t6557>- The Phelps house, down there.</t6557>
<t6558>- Ah, I see.</t6558>
<t6559>Later, he asked again:</t6559>
<t6560>- How did you say your friend got injured?</t6560>
<t6561>- He was sleepwalking and then got shot.</t6561>
<t6562>- Strange!</t6562>
<t6563>Then the doctor lit the lamp, grabbed his medicine bag, and went out.</t6563> <t6564>But when he saw the boat, he didn't like it, saying that it was too small, just enough for one person, and not safe for two people.</t6564> <t6565>I said:</t6565>
<t6566>- Don't worry, sir, the three of us are still sitting comfortably.</t6566>
<t6567>- Why are there three people?</t6567>
<t6568>- Me, Sid, and... and... the gun makes three.</t6568>
<t6569>- Oh, really?</t6569>
<t6570>He stepped onto the side of the boat, tested it, then shook his head and said he would have to find a bigger boat, but all the boats were chained and locked.</t6570> <t6571>So he climbed back into my boat and told me to wait for him to return.</t6571>
<t6572>I suddenly had an idea.</t6572> <t6573>I told myself: what if he can't cure Tom's leg right away? What if it takes three or four days to heal?</t6573> <t6574>What would we do?</t6574> <t6575>Wait there until he finishes? What should I do then? I will wait, and whenever he comes back, if he says he won't go anymore, I will go down there, swim down if necessary, we will capture and tie him up, then take him down there, and after he finishes treating Tom, we will reward him with everything we have.</t6575> <t6576>Then we will let him go ashore.</t6576>
<t6577>Then I lay back on the pile of wood nearby to take a quick nap.</t6577> <t6578>When I woke up, I saw the sun was directly overhead.</t6578> <t6579>I jumped up and ran straight to the doctor's house, but they said the doctor had left the night before and hadn't returned yet.</t6579> <t6580>I thought to myself, this is really bad for Tom.</t6580> <t6581>I have to go to the island right away.</t6581> <t6582>I turned around, and at the corner of the road, I bumped right into Uncle Silas's stomach.</t6582> <t6583>He asked:</t6583>
<t6584>- Oh, Tom, where have you been all this time?</t6584>
<t6585>- I'm not going anywhere, Sid and I are chasing the runaway black man.</t6585>
<t6586>- Where have you been?</t6586> <t6587>Your aunt is worried sick about you.</t6587>
<t6588>I replied</t6588>
<t6589>- Auntie, don't worry, we're fine.</t6589> <t6590>We ran after the people with the dogs, but they ran too fast, and we got lost. Then we thought we heard them by the river, so we took the boat to chase them and crossed to the other side of the river, but we still couldn't find them.</t6590> <t6591>Then we went ashore to rest, we were so tired, we tied the boat and took a nap, we just woke up an hour ago.</t6591> <t6592>After that, we rowed the boat back here to get some news.</t6592> <t6593>Sid ran to the post office to gather information, and I came here to find something to eat before we head home.</t6593>
<t6594>So both of them went to the post office to look for Sid. But I knew, of course, that Sid wasn't there.</t6594> <t6595>My uncle received a new letter that had just arrived.</t6595> <t6596>We waited a little longer without seeing Sid. He said we should go home to let Aunt Sally know we were okay, and that Sid would find his way back on his own.</t6596> <t6597>When we got home, Aunt Sally was overjoyed, half laughing, half crying, hugging me tightly, giving me a delicious cake, and she said Sid would get the same when he returned.</t6597>
<t6598>The house was crowded with people, they were eating, drinking, and talking noisily.</t6598> <t6599>Mrs. Hotchkiss kept chattering incessantly.</t6599>
<t6600>- Ms. Phelps, I went to see that cell, and I found that black man really strange.</t6600> <t6601>I also told Ms. Damrell the same thing, didn't I, Ms. Damrell? Well, it's really bizarre.</t6601> <t6602>Just look at that grinding stone and you'll see.</t6602> <t6603>Things like a broken heart, living miserably for thirty-seven years, then the child of Louis... so many things.</t6603> <t6604>This black man is really bizarre!</t6604>
<t6605>Mrs. Damrell said:</t6605>
<t6606>- But that ladder made entirely of rags, I wonder what it uses that for?</t6606>
<t6607>- But how did it manage to bring the millstone in there?</t6607> <t6608>Who dug that hole?</t6608>
<t6609>- I was just about to ask that.</t6609> <t6610>How on earth did he manage to bring that millstone in there?</t6610> <t6611>Did he carry it all by himself?</t6611> <t6612>There must have been someone helping him, no, a lot of people helping; it must have taken more than a dozen people to help that black guy.</t6612> <t6613>If I find out who they are, I'll skin all the black people in this area! Damn!</t6613>
<t6614>- More than a dozen people?</t6614> <t6615>Even forty people couldn't finish all that stuff.</t6615> <t6616>Look, just try to look at that pile of knives, saws, hoes, and shovels. It's exhausting, and then there's the bed leg that's been sawed off, it would take six people a whole week to finish, and the black man made of straw placed on the bed, and then the...</t6616>
<t6617>- Strange, he has to have a group of black people in there every night, working for four weeks to get that much, Mrs. Phelps.</t6617> <t6618>Look at that shirt, every inch of it has a secret sign written in blood by Africans! There must always be a group there, no doubt about it.</t6618> <t6619>I'd pay two dollars right away to anyone who can read those secret words to me, and any black person who writes for me also has to explain what it means...</t6619>
<t6620>- Someone helped it, I'm sure you all would think the same if you stayed in that room for a while.</t6620> <t6621>They can steal everything, even if you're standing next to it.</t6621> <t6622>They steal the shirt right off the clothesline.</t6622> <t6623>And the bed sheet they used as a rope, who wouldn't say they could steal that?</t6623> <t6624>Then flour, candles, candlesticks, spoons, even the old feather duster, and a thousand other things I can't remember; then my cloth shirt.</t6624> <t6625>So then Silas, Sid, Tom, and I spent all day guarding.</t6625> <t6626>There! Like I said, none of us saw or heard anything. Yet suddenly, it passed right under our noses and made a mess of us; not only that, but there was a whole gang of red-skinned thieves too, and now it has taken the black man away and even sixteen people with twenty dogs chasing couldn't catch it! Even the devil couldn't do something more terrifying and quick than that.</t6626> <t6627>Our dogs, you know, yet the whole pack couldn't find any trace...</t6627>
<t6628>- Creepy, I've never...</t6628>
<t6629>- It's really scary! Terrifying, I don't dare to sleep, don't dare to lie down, don't dare to sit.</t6629> <t6630>I keep praying to God, hoping it won't steal anyone from my family! During the day, I almost go crazy, there are two nephews sleeping upstairs, I have to lock the door tightly.</t6630> <t6631>Who wouldn't be scared?</t6631> <t6632>Every day it gets more terrifying, then ghosts and spirits haunt me, making me do foolish things.</t6632> <t6633>Then, I think if I were the child lying up there, and saw the door wasn't locked then...</t6633>
<t6634>Aunt stopped, looked around, and when her eyes saw me, I stood up and walked outside immediately.</t6634> <t6635>She pulled me back, kissed me, and patted my head. Sitting there lost in thought, suddenly she startled, her voice filled with panic:</t6635>
<t6636>- It's almost dark and Sid still hasn't come back! Did something happen to him?</t6636>
<t6637>I felt so lucky, I suddenly stood up and said:</t6637>
<t6638>- No, don't go anymore.</t6638> <t6639>Isn't one missing child enough?</t6639> <t6640>If it doesn't come back by mealtime, let me go look for it.</t6640>
<t6641>By dinner time, he still hadn't returned.</t6641> <t6642>So after eating, Uncle Silas left immediately.</t6642>
<t6643>By ten o'clock, he returned, looking sad, because there was no sign of Tom anywhere.</t6643> <t6644>Aunt Sally was very worried; but Uncle Silas said it was nothing to worry about, and that he would be back by morning.</t6644> <t6645>Aunt Sally felt somewhat reassured, but she still sat there, keeping the light on so that Tom could see it and find his way back.</t6645>
<t6646>Later, I went upstairs.</t6646> <t6647>She also brought the candle up, led me into the room, and comforted me so much that I felt embarrassed and didn't dare to look her in the face anymore.</t6647> <t6648>Then she sat down beside the bed and talked to me for a long time, saying that Sid was really a clever boy.</t6648> <t6649>From time to time, she asked me if he might be lost somewhere, or injured, or drowned, or where he might be lying at that moment.</t6649> <t6650>Then her tears quietly fell, and I had to tell her that Sid was still safe and that he would surely be back by morning.</t6650> <t6651>After that, she held my hand tightly, perhaps kissed me too, and told me to keep repeating those words to reassure her because she was very worried.</t6651> <t6652>Then she stepped out, turned back to look at me affectionately, and said:</t6652>
<t6653>- Auntie didn't lock the door, Tom.</t6653> <t6654>There's a window over there, near the lamppost, but you have to be good, okay, don't go anywhere.</t6654> <t6655>You must love Auntie!</t6655>
<t6656>I was anxious and just wanted to see how Tom was doing.</t6656> <t6657>He was about to get up and go, but then he didn't.</t6657>
<t6658>But I still thought about Aunt Saly, thought about Tom tossing and turning, unable to sleep.</t6658> <t6659>Twice I slid down the lamppost and went outside, then turned back to look at the candle in the window and saw Aunt Saly's eyes looking out onto the street, tears streaming down, and I thought I had to do something for her, but I couldn't do anything.</t6659> <t6660>The third time, I got up at dawn, went downstairs, and saw Aunt Saly still sitting there, she had fallen asleep on her hand.</t6660>
<t6661>chapter xlii</t6661>
<t6662>Uncle Silas went looking for Tom before breakfast but returned without any trace of him.</t6662> <t6663>The couple sat at the table, thinking silently, looking very sad.</t6663> <t6664>Their coffee had gone cold, but they still had no appetite to eat.</t6664> <t6665>After a while, he said:</t6665>
<t6666>Have I given the letter to her yet?</t6666>
<t6667>- Which letter?</t6667>
<t6668>- The letter I received at the post office yesterday.</t6668>
<t6669>- No, you didn't give me any letter.</t6669>
<t6670>- Maybe I forgot.</t6670>
<t6671>He searched in his pocket but couldn't find it, then went somewhere to get the letter and handed it to her.</t6671> <t6672>She said:</t6672>
<t6673>- The letter from Petersburg has arrived, it's her letter.</t6673>
<t6674>I thought to myself that perhaps it would be better to go outside and play for a while.</t6674> <t6675>But Aunt Sally hadn't had time to open the letter when she suddenly dropped it and ran out.</t6675> <t6676>There was Tom lying on a padded stretcher, then the doctor, then Jim, dressed in cloth clothes, his hands tied in front of him with a bunch of people following behind.</t6676> <t6677>I quickly picked up the letter and hid it.</t6677> <t6678>Aunt Sally rushed to Tom, crying and saying:</t6678>
<t6679>- Oh, it's dead, I knew it...</t6679>
<t6680>Tom turned his head and whispered something, and then Aunt Saly raised both her hands again.</t6680>
<t6681>- Oh, dear God, it's still alive! It's you.</t6681>
<t6682>Then she kissed him, rushed into the house to prepare the bed, and shouted orders that made the black people flustered.</t6682> <t6683>I followed the group to see what they would do with Jim while the doctor and Uncle Silas followed Tom into the house.</t6683> <t6684>The people seemed angry, some wanted to hang Jim immediately as an example for other black people, but others said they shouldn't do that because he wasn't a local black person, and what if his owner came to claim compensation.</t6684> <t6685>Hearing that, they calmed down a bit.</t6685> <t6686>They cursed Jim terribly.</t6686> <t6687>Every now and then, someone would kick Jim.</t6687> <t6688>But Jim didn't say anything and acted as if he didn't know who I was.</t6688> <t6689>Then they locked Jim back in the old cell, dressed him in old clothes, chained him to the large plank on the floor, chained both his hands and feet, and said they would only give him bread and water until his owner came or he was sold at auction.</t6689> <t6690>Then they sealed the hole we had dug and assigned two people to stand guard with guns every night; during the day, they tied a fierce dog at the door.</t6690> <t6691>Once everything was done, they were about to leave, bidding Jim farewell with a curse when the doctor arrived, took a quick look, and said:</t6691>
<t6692>- Everyone, don't treat him so badly, because he is not a bad black man.</t6692><t6693>When I came to find that boy, I had no one to help me to extract the bullet.</t6693><t6694>And I couldn't leave the boy there, as he was getting more critical by the minute.</t6694><t6695>He went crazy, absolutely refused to let me come near, and told me that if I drew chalk on the raft, he would kill me.</t6695><t6696>I felt there was nothing I could do with him.</t6696><t6697>Suddenly, at that moment, this black man crawled out from somewhere and said he would lend a hand.</t6697><t6698>Of course, I immediately thought he was the runaway black man.</t6698><t6699>So I had to stay there for a whole day and night.</t6699><t6700>It was really a tight spot! At home, I had some patients waiting, I wanted to run back to check on them, but I couldn't, because I was also afraid that if the black man ran away, I would be blamed; and at that time, there were no boats passing by to call for help.</t6700><t6701>So I had to wait until this morning.</t6701><t6702>And I have never seen a black man more skillful and loyal than him; he even sacrificed his freedom to do that.</t6702><t6703>He was also very tired.</t6703><t6704>I could clearly see that he must have been working a lot recently.</t6704><t6705>A black man like that is worth a thousand dollars, and deserves to be treated better.</t6705><t6706>Then I saw some people coming by boat, luckily the black man was sitting on the plank, head down on his knees, fast asleep. I signaled the boat to come closer, they jumped up and held the black man tightly and tied him up, so it wasn't too difficult for us.</t6706><t6707>As for the boy, he also fell asleep.</t6707><t6708>We moved the oars to the raft, rowed gently, then docked and tied the raft.</t6708><t6709>From start to finish, this black man did not show any sign of wanting to move or say a word.</t6709><t6710>He is not a bad black man, that's what I think.</t6710>
<t6711>Someone said:</t6711>
<t6712>- Yes, I think so too.</t6712>
<t6713>Then the others also calmed down a bit.</t6713> <t6714>I silently thanked that old doctor for speaking up for Jim; he was an exceptionally kind person.</t6714> <t6715>Everyone agreed that Jim had done very well, deserving praise and a reward.</t6715> <t6716>So everyone sincerely promised that they would not scold Jim anymore.</t6716>
<t6717>Then they went out, locked Jim in there, and locked the door.</t6717> <t6718>I wished someone would say that they could remove some of the chains for Jim because those chains were too heavy, and give Jim vegetables, meat with bread, and water.</t6718> <t6719>But no one thought of that at all.</t6719> <t6720>Aunt Sally was on duty in the sick room day and night, and whenever I saw Uncle Silas hanging around there, I would avoid him.</t6720>
<t6721>The next morning, seeing Tom was better, and Aunt Sally went to sleep for a while, I sneaked into the sick room, if he was awake, we would come up with a reasonable story together.</t6721> <t6722>But he was still asleep, his face pale, not rosy like the day he first arrived.</t6722> <t6723>I sat down, waiting for him to wake up.</t6723> <t6724>About half an hour later, Aunt Sally walked in, startling me.</t6724> <t6725>She told me to be quiet, then sat down beside me.</t6725> <t6726>She seemed happy that Tom had returned to normal.</t6726> <t6727>Then we sat there watching.</t6727> <t6728>A moment later, he stirred, opened his eyes very naturally.</t6728> <t6729>He looked around and then said:</t6729>
<t6730>- Why am I at home? Where is the raft?</t6730>
<t6731>- Everything is calm now - I replied.</t6731>
<t6732>- What about Jim?</t6732>
<t6733>- Same here - I replied, my voice not very calm.</t6733> <t6734>It spoke again:</t6734>
<t6735>- That's great! Did you tell Auntie?</t6735>
<t6736>I was about to answer when Aunt Saly interrupted and asked</t6736>
<t6737>- About what, child?</t6737>
<t6738>- About everything that has happened.</t6738>
<t6739>- What's the matter?</t6739>
<t6740>- The story of us releasing the black man...</t6740>
<t6741>- What? Release the black man ...</t6741> <t6742>This kid, what is he saying? He’s babbling again.</t6742>
<t6743>- No, I didn't dream it.</t6743> <t6744>It was Tom and I who set him free...</t6744>
<t6745>So it began to tell the story, while Aunt Saly sat quietly listening to it.</t6745> <t6746>As for me, I felt that interrupting would be pointless.</t6746>
<t6747>- We had to put so much effort into it, weeks, hours, nights when the whole family was asleep.</t6747> <t6748>Then we stole candles, bed sheets, aunt's clothes, then spoons, iron plates, daggers, incubators, millstones, flour, and all sorts of other things.</t6748> <t6749>You can't imagine what those saws, pens, and those markings were for; and you couldn't imagine the fun of it.</t6749> <t6750>Then we also drew coffin shapes, wrote anonymous letters from the robbers, we kept sliding up and down the lamp post; then dug a hole in the prison, made a rope ladder, then baked a cake and stuffed the rope ladder into it, then put spoons and other things into your kitchen apron pocket.</t6750>
<t6751>- Oh Lord! - Aunt Saly exclaimed.</t6751>
<t6752>-... .</t6752> <t6753>Then we brought mice and snakes in there to keep Jim company; then aunt kept Tom here for so long that the butter on his hat melted and almost ruined our plans.</t6753> <t6754>Then we were chased, I got stuck and got shot.</t6754> <t6755>We hid by the roadside to let them pass, then took the canoe to the raft.</t6755> <t6756>Everything went well, and Jim was free.</t6756> <t6757>Do you find it exciting?</t6757>
<t6758>- Since the day I was born, I've never heard of such a strange story.</t6758> <t6759>So it turns out you brats caused all this trouble, making everyone frantic and scared to death.</t6759> <t6760>Do you really enjoy making me suffer every night?</t6760> <t6761>You little devils, I'll give you a lesson to stop playing such mischievous pranks.</t6761>
<t6762>But Tom was very delighted.</t6762> <t6763>He kept chattering non-stop.</t6763> <t6764>Aunt Sally was both annoyed and amused.</t6764> <t6765>She said:</t6765>
<t6766>- Now you all have had your fun, but if I catch you having any more dealings with it...</t6766>
<t6767>- Relationship with whom? - Tom asked, laughing, looking very surprised.</t6767>
<t6768>- With whom? The black guy who ran away, of course.</t6768> <t6769>Who else do you think?</t6769>
<t6770>- Tom looked at me very seriously and asked:</t6770>
<t6771>- Tom, why did you just tell me that everything is fine?</t6771> <t6772>Has he escaped yet?</t6772>
<t6773>Sister Saly asked:</t6773>
<t6774>- The black man who ran away?</t6774> <t6775>Of course not yet.</t6775> <t6776>They have caught him and locked him back in that room, only giving him bread and water, carefully chained, waiting until someone comes to claim or sell him.</t6776>
<t6777>Tom was lying on the bed when he suddenly sat up, his eyes bloodshot, his nostrils flaring like a fish's gills, then he looked at me and shouted:</t6777>
<t6778>- They have no right to capture Jim. You run away immediately, set him free! He is not a slave, he is as free as anyone on this earth!</t6778>
<t6779>-This kid talks strangely, doesn't he?</t6779>
<t6780>- Aunt Sally, everything I said is true.</t6780> <t6781>Both Tom and I know him well. Miss Watson has been dead for two months now, and she was very ashamed of planning to sell him down South. She said that she agreed to let him be free.</t6781>
<t6782>- You know that it is already free, so what freedom are you planning to return to it?</t6782>
<t6783>- That's the real issue.</t6783> <t6784>It's just that I like adventure, and I had to plunge into blood and fire to do it.</t6784> <t6785>Oh my God! Aunt Polly!</t6785>
<t6786>At that moment, I seemed to see Aunt Polly standing inside the doorway, gentle and majestic like a fairy.</t6786>
<t6787>Aunt Saly ran out and hugged Aunt Polly tightly, almost bumping her head into her, then started crying, while I slipped under the bed.</t6787> <t6788>I peeked out, and in a moment, Tom's Aunt Polly came in, staring at him through her glasses as if she was about to crush him.</t6788> <t6789>Then she said:</t6789>
<t6790>- Tom, you'd better turn away.</t6790> <t6791>If it were me, I would do the same.</t6791>
<t6792>Aunt Saly exclaimed:</t6792>
<t6793>- Oh, hey, it's not Tom, it's Sid, Tom! Tom! Where has Tom run off to, he was just here!</t6793>
<t6794>- Do you mean to say that Huck Finn is somewhere around here?</t6794> <t6795>Is it possible that I've been raising that kid for so many years and still wouldn't recognize him? Huck Finn, come out from under the bed!</t6795>
<t6796>I crawled out, but it wasn't as natural as before.</t6796>
<t6797>Aunt Sally was in a state of panic, and Uncle Silas, upon hearing everything, was no less panicked.</t6797> <t6798>That night, he called the whole family to pray so that he could regain his composure.</t6798> <t6799>Then Tom's Aunt Polly recounted everything about who I was, what I was like, and I had to stand up and explain everything from the beginning.</t6799> <t6800>Aunt Sally interrupted:</t6800>
<t6801>- You can just call me Aunt Saly, I'm used to it, no need to change it.</t6801>
<t6802>Aunt Polly said that Tom was right, Miss Watson had set Jim free. That's it.</t6802> <t6803>Tom took upon himself all the hardships and struggles to free a black man who was already free! And it wasn't until now that I understood why someone as educated as Tom would join me in freeing a black man.</t6803>
<t6804>Then Mrs. Polly said that Aunt Sally had written her a letter saying that Tom and Sid had arrived safely; and she had told herself:</t6804>
<t6805>- When I let it go alone without anyone accompanying it, I didn't think this situation would happen.</t6805> <t6806>Now I have to struggle and travel over a thousand miles down there to see if there's anyone else named Sid.</t6806> <t6807>And when I asked, she didn't respond at all.</t6807>
<t6808>Aunt Saly said:</t6808>
<t6809>- I haven't received any news from you?</t6809>
<t6810>- I wrote to you twice asking what it means that Sid is there?</t6810>
<t6811>- I did not receive any letter from you.</t6811>
<t6812>- It's you again, Tom!</t6812>
<t6813>- What did you say? - It replied, mischievously.</t6813>
<t6814>- Don't ask me anything else.</t6814> <t6815>Hand over the letter!</t6815>
<t6816>- Which letter?</t6816>
<t6817>- What letter?</t6817> <t6818>I'm really annoyed now, if you keep lying, I will...</t6818>
<t6819>- Yes, it's in that box.</t6819> <t6820>It's still exactly as it was when I picked it up from the post office.</t6820> <t6821>I haven't looked at it, nor have I touched it.</t6821> <t6822>But I guessed there would be some trouble, so I...</t6822>
<t6823>- I will definitely skin you alive.</t6823> <t6824>I also wrote another letter, informing her that I am about to come down here, or maybe it also...</t6824>
<t6825>- That letter just arrived yesterday; I haven't read it yet, but I have already put it away.</t6825>
<t6826>I want to bet two dollars right now that Aunt Saly doesn't have that letter, but on second thought, I realized it would be better to stay silent.</t6826> <t6827>So I didn't say a word.</t6827>
<t6828>The Final Chapter</t6828>
<t6829>As soon as I got a chance to meet Tom alone, I immediately asked him what he thought during the escape?</t6829> <t6830>How would he plan if the escape was successful and how would he restore freedom to Jim?</t6830> <t6831>He said that if we managed to rescue Jim safely, we would let him sit on a raft drifting downstream, and together we would venture all the way to the river's mouth. At that point, we would tell him that he was free, then put him on a steamboat home, reward him, gather all the black folks around to dance and escort him into town with a proper parade, complete with drums and trumpets; he would become a hero, and so would the two of us.</t6831> <t6832>But I think we've almost done just that already.</t6832>
<t6833>We helped Jim get free from the chains. When Aunt Polly, Uncle Silas, and Aunt Sally learned how Jim had helped the doctor take care of Tom, they were very moved, praised him endlessly, gave Jim all the food he liked, let him rest, and didn't make him do anything at all.</t6833> <t6834>Tom gave Jim forty dollars for being a very patient prisoner and playing that role very well.</t6834> <t6835>Jim was overjoyed and exclaimed:</t6835>
<t6836>- Hey Huck, didn't I tell you?</t6836> <t6837>I told you that I have a lot of hair on my chest, which is a sign of good luck; and I also said that I was once wealthy and that I would be rich again in the future.</t6837> <t6838>So now it's true, isn't it?</t6838> <t6839>Here, here's the money.</t6839> <t6840>I told you, I knew for sure that one day I would be rich again, and it's true just like I am right now.</t6840>
<t6841>Then Tom kept talking, saying that one night the three of us should go out there to get some tools and go on an adventure for a few weeks into Indian territory.</t6841> <t6842>I said okay, I liked that idea too, but I didn't have money to buy tools, and I thought there wouldn't be any at home either; because my father had probably returned and taken all the money from Judge Thatcher to go drinking.</t6842>
<t6843>Tom said:</t6843>
<t6844>- No, not yet.</t6844> <t6845>All more than six thousand dollars are still there, and your father hasn't returned since then.</t6845>
<t6846>Jim said solemnly:</t6846>
<t6847>- He is not coming back anymore, Huck.</t6847>
<t6848>I asked"</t6848>
<t6849>- Why did Jim say that?</t6849>
<t6850>- I am sure of that, don't ask anymore.</t6850>
<t6851>But I kept asking persistently, and finally he said:</t6851>
<t6852>- Do you remember that floating house on the river?</t6852> <t6853>There was a dead person inside, with a cloth covering their face.</t6853> <t6854>I went in and lifted it to see, then didn't let you in to look, right? You can take your money back whenever you want, because the dead person in that house is him.</t6854>
<t6855>Now, Tom was almost completely recovered.</t6855> <t6856>He tied the bullet to a string and wore it around his neck like a watch, occasionally taking it out to check the time.</t6856>
<t6857>I don't know what else to write for this book.</t6857> <t6858>If I had known how difficult writing a book would be, I wouldn't have written it, nor would I have intended to write it.</t6858> <t6859>But anyway, I still have to go to the territory of the Native Americans because Aunt Saly intends to raise and civilize me; and I cannot stand that, as I already know enough about it.</t6859>
