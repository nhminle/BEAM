and in a few words, as far as I could gather, it seems to be this: Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man with whom I used to joke with you (although, as things have turned out, I am now terribly glad that there was indeed nothing of that sort), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it appears, has been engaged for more than a year to my cousin Lucy!</t3596> <t3597>There you have it, dear!</t3597> <t3598>And without anyone knowing a word about it, except Nancy!</t3598> <t3599>Would you have believed it possible?</t3599> <t3600>It's not at all strange that they like each other, but that things progressed so far between them, and without anyone suspecting!</t3600> <t3601>That is indeed strange!</t3601> <t3602>I never saw them together, or I would surely have discovered it immediately.</t3602> <t3603>Well, and then they kept all this very secret for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother nor your sister-in-law suspected anything about the whole matter... until this very morning, poor Nancy, who, as you know, is a very well-intentioned creature, but nothing in the realm of conspiracies, blurted it all out.</t3603> <t3604>\u201cHeavens!\u201d, she thought to herself, \u201cthey are so fond of Lucy, they surely won't oppose it\u201d; and so, she came and went to her sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood, who was alone embroidering her tapestry, without imagining what was coming... because she had just told her brother, barely five minutes ago, that she was planning to arrange a marriage for Edward with the daughter of some lord, I don't remember which.</t3604> <t3605>So you can imagine the blow it was to her vanity and pride.</t3605> <t3606>She immediately had a hysterical fit, with such screams that they even reached the ears of her brother, who was in his own study downstairs, thinking of writing a letter to his steward in the country.</t3606> <t3607>Then he flew upstairs and there was a terrible scene, because by then Lucy had joined them, without dreaming of what was happening.</t3607> <t3608>Poor creature!</t3608> <t3609>I pity her.</t3609> <t3610>And believe me, I think they behaved very harshly with her; her sister-in-law scolded her in a fury, until she fainted.</t3610> <t3611>Nancy, for her part, fell to her knees and cried bitterly; and her brother paced the room saying he didn't know what to do.</t3611> <t3612>Mrs. Dashwood said the young women could not stay a minute longer in the house, and her brother also had to kneel to convince her to let them stay at least until they had packed their clothes.</t3612> <t3613>And then she had another hysterical fit, and he was so scared that he sent for Mr. Donovan, and Mr. Donovan found the house all in commotion.</t3613> <t3614>The carriage was ready at the door to take my poor cousins away, and they were just getting in when he came out; poor Lucy, he told me, was in such bad condition that she could barely walk; and Nancy was almost as bad.</t3614> <t3615>Let me tell you that I have no patience with her sister-in-law; and I hope with all my heart that they get married, despite her opposition.</t3615> <t3616>God!</t3616> <t3617>How poor Mr. Edward will feel when he finds out!</t3617> <t3618>That they have treated his beloved so badly!</t3618> <t3619>Because they say he loves her immensely, with all his might.</t3619> <t3620>I wouldn't be surprised if he felt the greatest passion!</t3620> <t3621>And Mr. Donovan thinks the same.</t3621> <t3622>We talked a lot about this;
