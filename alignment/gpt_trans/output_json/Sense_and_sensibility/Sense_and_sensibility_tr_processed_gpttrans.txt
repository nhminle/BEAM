<t0>FIRST BOOK</t0>
<t1>The Dashwood family had settled in Sussex a long time ago.</t1><t2>They were large landowners; their house was at Norland Park in the middle of the estate, and for generations, they had lived there in a very respectable manner, earning the respect of the people around them.</t2><t3>The last owner of the estate was an unmarried man who had reached a very advanced age and had kept his sister as his companion and housekeeper for most of his life.</t3><t4>But the death of his sister ten years ago had created a great change in his home; to fill the void left by his sister, he invited and accepted into his home the family of his nephew, Mr. Henry Dashwood, who was the legal heir to the Norland estate and whom he also intended to leave the estate to.</t4><t5>In the company of his nephew, his nephew's wife, and their children, the old gentleman's last days were comfortable.</t5><t6>His attachment to all of them increased.</t6><t7>The continuous care that Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood showed him, which stemmed not so much from self-interest but from good-heartedness, provided him with every comfort that his age could enjoy; the children's cheerfulness also added a special joy to his life.</t7>
<t8>Mr. Henry Dashwood had a son from his previous marriage and three daughters from his current wife.</t8> <t9>His son, a sensible and respectable young man, had a reasonable income from the large fortune that his mother had left him half of when he came of age.</t9> <t10>His own marriage, which took place shortly after, also significantly increased his wealth.</t10> <t11>Therefore, the ownership of the Norland estate was not as crucial to him as it was to his sisters; because aside from the share they might receive from their father's inheritance of that estate, the girls would not have much of a dowry.</t11> <t12>Their mother had nothing; their father had only seven thousand pounds, as the fortune of his first wife was tied up for her child, leaving him only a lifetime interest income.</t12>
<t13>The old gentleman died; his will was read, and like almost every will, it caused both joy and disappointment.</t13> <t14>He had not been so unjust or ungrateful as to leave his property to anyone other than his nephew; -but he had left the property to his nephew under such conditions that half of its value was lost.</t14> <t15>Mr. Dashwood had wanted the inheritance more for his wife and daughters than for himself or his son: -but the inheritance was mortgaged to his son and his son's four-year-old son, moreover, without leaving him the possibility to take care of those closest to him and most in need of income by renting out the land or selling its valuable forests.</t15> <t16>Everything was given to the possession of this child who, during his rare visits to Norland with his father and mother, had won his uncle's affection to such an extent that it diminished the value of all the affection he had received for years from his nephew and daughters, with his captivating qualities unusual in two or three-year-old children, his half-spoken words, his desire to do as he pleased, his cunning tricks, and his noise and clamor.</t16> <t17>However, he did not want to be heartless and, as a sign of the affection he felt for the three girls, he left them one thousand pounds each.</t17>
<t18>Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was severe at first; but his temperament was cheerful and optimistic; he could naturally expect to live many more years, and by living frugally, he could set aside a considerable amount from the produce income of an already extensive estate that was almost immediately ready to be operated.</t18> <t19>But the fortune, which was quite delayed in arriving, became his income for only one year.</t19> <t20>He did not live long after his uncle; including the last inheritances, only ten thousand pounds remained for his widow and daughters.</t20>
<t21>When his life-threatening condition was discovered, his son was immediately summoned; Mr. Dashwood, with all the strength and insistence his illness allowed, bequeathed the care of his stepmother and sisters to his son.</t21>
<t22>Mr. John Dashwood did not possess the strong emotions of the other family members; but he was affected by such a will conversation at such a time and promised to do his best to comfort them.</t22> <t23>This assurance relieved his father; then Mr. John Dashwood found time to consider what he could do for them within the bounds of reason.</t23>
<t24>He was not a heartless young man, if being a little insensitive, even selfish, does not count as heartlessness: but he was generally respected, because he conducted his daily affairs with a sense of propriety and decorum.</t24> <t25>He might have become even more esteemed had he married a more charming woman: -he was very young when he married and was very fond of his wife.</t25> <t26>But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of her husband; -narrower-minded and more selfish.</t26>
<t27>When he promised his father, he deliberated within himself and thought of increasing his sisters' fortunes by giving them a gift of a thousand pounds each.</t27> <t28>Then he decided that he could indeed manage this much.</t28> <t29>Thinking about an additional four thousand pounds a year to his current income, plus the remaining half of his mother's fortune, warmed his heart and made him feel that he had the power to be generous.</t29> <t30>"Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be generous and grand!</t30> <t31>This would be enough to make them quite comfortable.</t31> <t32>Three thousand pounds! He could set aside such a significant amount without much trouble."</t32> <t33>-He thought about this all day, then for many days in a row, and he did not regret it.</t33>
<t34>As soon as her father's funeral was over, Mrs. John Dashwood arrived with her child and helpers without informing her stepmother of her intentions.</t34> <t35>No one could dispute her right to come; from the moment her father died, the house belonged to her husband; but the rudeness of her behavior was significant, and it would have been quite distressing for any woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, even if she had only ordinary feelings. However, Mrs. Dashwood possessed such a strong sense of honor, such passionate nobility, that any insult, no matter who it came from or who it was directed at, was a source of profound disgust for her.</t35> <t36>Mrs. John Dashwood was not someone anyone in her husband's family liked; but until now, she had never had the opportunity to show them how little concern she could act with for the welfare of others when the situation demanded it.</t36>
<t37>Mrs. Dashwood felt this vulgar behavior so acutely and resented her daughter-in-law so much for it that, had it not been for her eldest daughter's advice making her consider whether it was appropriate to leave, and then her deep love for her three children convincing her to stay and avoid conflict with their brother, she would have permanently left the house when her daughter-in-law arrived.</t37>
<t38>Her eldest daughter Elinor, whose advice was quite effective, possessed a strong understanding and calm judgment; even though she was only nineteen years old, these qualities made her the counselor of her mother and often gave her the chance to balance Mrs. Dashwood's often imprudent hastiness in a way that benefited them all.</t38> <t39>She had a wonderful heart; her manners were affectionate; her feelings were strong, but she also knew how to manage them: a knowledge that her mother had not yet learned and one of her sisters was determined never to learn.</t39>
<t40>Marianne's abilities were in many ways not inferior to Elinor's.</t40> <t41>She was intelligent and clever, but hasty in everything; her sorrow and her joy knew no bounds.</t41> <t42>Generous, charming, and engaging: her only deficiency was common sense.</t42> <t43>There was a striking resemblance between her and her mother.</t43>
<t44>Elinor watched her sister's passionate excesses with concern; but Mrs. Dashwood valued and supported them.</t44> <t45>They were now encouraging each other regarding the severity of the disaster that had befallen them.</t45> <t46>The grief that initially rendered them powerless was voluntarily renewed, sought after, and recreated repeatedly.</t46> <t47>They gave themselves entirely to their sorrow; they tried to amplify the feeling of misery as much as possible with every thought and stubbornly resisted the idea that there could be consolation in the future.</t47> <t48>Elinor was also in deep sorrow; but she could still struggle and assert herself.</t48> <t49>She could talk to her brother, greet her sister-in-law when she arrived and show her proper attention, and she tried to persuade her mother to come forward and be equally resilient.</t49>
<t50>The other sister, Margaret, was a good-natured, well-intentioned girl; but having already adopted much of Marianne's enthusiasm without her sense, at thirteen, she did not give much hope of catching up to her sisters later in life.</t50>
<t51>Mrs. John Dashwood declared herself the mistress of Norland; her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law were reduced to the status of guests.</t51> <t52>Nevertheless, she treated them very politely as guests; her husband was as kind to them as he could be to anyone other than himself, his wife, and his sons.</t52> <t53>She even insisted that they should consider Norland as their home; Mrs. Dashwood, having no more reasonable plan in mind until she could find a house nearby, accepted the offer.</t53>
<t54>Staying in a place where everything reminded her of old happiness was just the thing for her.</t54> <t55>During times of joy, no one could be more cheerful than her, and she had an optimistic expectation of happiness itself more than anyone else.</t55> <t56>But in times of sorrow, her dreams would take her to an equally inconsolable place, just as she was unreachable in her moments of joy.</t56>
<t57>Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters.</t57> <t58>Taking three thousand pounds from her dear son's fortune would condemn him to dreadful poverty.</t58> <t59>She begged her husband to reconsider the matter.</t59> <t60>How could she justify to herself robbing her only child, and of such a large amount?</t60> <t61>Moreover, how could the Dashwood girls have any right to expect such a large sum from his generosity, when they were only half-relations to him, which in her view hardly counted as kinship at all.</t61> <t62>It was quite obvious that no closeness was to be expected between children from different marriages; so why should she ruin herself and her poor little Henrys, giving away all their money to strangers?</t62>
<t63>"My father's last request from me," her husband replied, "was to support his widow and daughters.</t63><t64>"</t64>
<t65>"I don't think your father knew what he was talking about; I bet he had already lost his mind.</t65> <t66>If he were in his right mind, he wouldn't have asked you to take half of your inheritance from your own child and distribute it to others.</t66><t67>"</t67>
<t68>"He did not specify a certain amount, my dear Fanny; he just generally requested, said to support them, said let their situation be more comfortable than it was in his time.</t68> <t69>Maybe he could have left the matter entirely to me.</t69> <t70>He would have guessed that I wouldn't neglect them.</t70> <t71>But when he asked me to promise, I couldn't help but give it: at least that's how I felt at the time.</t71> <t72>Therefore, a promise was made and it needs to be fulfilled.</t72> <t73>When they leave Norland and move to a new house, something should be done for them.</t73><t74>"</t74>
<t75>"Alright, let it be done, but let's not make it a thousand pounds.</t75> <t76>Think about it," he added, "once the money is gone, the sisters will marry, and the money will go with them.</t76> <t77>But if it were to come back to our poor child-"</t77>
<t78>"Of course," said her husband in a serious tone, "then the situation would change.</t78> <t79>The day may come when Henry regrets losing such a large sum of money.</t79> <t80>If he has a large family, for instance, this money would be very useful.</t80><t81>"</t81>
<t82>"And how."</t82><t83>"</t83>
<t84>"Then maybe reducing the amount by half would be better for both parties.</t84> <t85>-Five hundred pounds would be quite a contribution to their fortune!</t85><t86>"</t86>
<t87>"It would be an incredible contribution indeed!</t87> <t88>In life, which brother would do even half of this for his sisters, even if they were his real sisters!</t88> <t89>Moreover - they're just stepsisters!</t89> <t90>-But you have such a generous spirit!</t90><t91>"</t91>
<t92>"I don't want to act vulgarly," replied her husband.</t92> <t93>"In such situations, it is better to do more than to do less.</t93> <t94>At least no one can say that I didn't do my best for them: even they themselves cannot expect more.</t94><t95>"</t95>
<t96>"How are we supposed to know what they can expect," said the lady, "and we don't have to think about what they are expecting either: the point is, how much you can give."</t96><t97>"</t97>
<t98>"Of course - I suppose I can give them five hundred pounds each.</t98> <t99>Currently, without my addition, when their mother dies, each of them will have more than three thousand pounds - a very reasonable fortune for each young woman.</t99><t100>"</t100>
<t101>"And how: really, now I realize they don't need any additional money at all.</t101> <t102>They will share ten thousand pounds among themselves: If they marry, even better; if they don't, they will live quite comfortably on the interest of ten thousand pounds.</t102><t103>"</t103>
<t104>"Exactly; therefore, I wonder if instead of the girls, I should do something for their mother as long as she is alive - like an annual income or something."</t104> <t105>"My sisters would feel the positive impact of this just as much as she would."</t105> <t106>"A hundred pounds a year would make them all live quite comfortably."</t106><t107>"</t107>
<t108>However, his wife hesitated a bit in approving this plan.</t108>
<t109>"Of course," he said, "it's better than saying goodbye to fifteen hundred pounds all at once."</t109> <t110>But if Mrs. Dashwood lives for another fifteen years, it will still be the same for us.</t110><t111>"</t111>
<t112>"Fifteen years!</t112> <t113>Dear Fanny, his life isn't worth even half of that money.</t113><t114>"</t114>
<t115>"Not at all; but if you pay attention, people who receive annual income never seem to die; the woman is quite vigorous, full of life, and not even forty yet.</t115> <t116>Annual payment is a very serious matter; a year passes in a flash, it comes again, you can't escape it.</t116> <t117>You don't know what you're doing.</t117> <t118>I know how troublesome annual payments can be; you have no idea how my mother struggled when my father's will burdened her with paying annual salaries to three old retired servants.</t118> <t119>Salaries were paid twice a year; and there was the trouble of getting the money to them; then it was said that one of them had died, but it turned out that wasn't the case.</t119> <t120>My mother was exasperated.</t120> <t121>She used to say, when people are constantly asking for money, you can't be the master of your own money; of course, it was my father's thoughtlessness, because otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal.</t121> <t122>This situation made me hate the concept of annual payments so much that I would never get involved in it in my life.</t122><t123>"</t123>
<t124>"An unpleasant thing, of course," replied Mr. Dashwood, "for one's income to go through a hole every year.</t124> <t125>As mother rightly pointed out, one's wealth cannot truly belong to oneself.</t125> <t126>Having to regularly pay such an amount every rent day is not something one can endure; one's freedom is taken away.</t126><t127>"</t127>
<t128>"Undoubtedly; moreover, you don't even get a thank you in return.</t128> <t129>They feel secure, you are just doing what is expected, and this does not create any gratitude.</t129> <t130>If I were you, I would only do whatever I do based on my own decision.</t130> <t131>I wouldn't commit myself to making annual payments to them.</t131> <t132>In some years, it might be difficult to cut even a hundred or fifty pounds from our own expenses.</t132><t133>"</t133>
<t134>"You are absolutely right, my dear; in this situation, it would be better not to have an annual payment; whatever I give them occasionally would be much more beneficial than an annual salary, because if they are assured of a larger income, the first thing they would do is elevate their lifestyle; by the end of the year, they would not have a penny left.</t134> <t135>This is definitely the best way.</t135> <t136>Giving fifty pounds occasionally prevents them from running out of money and certainly fulfills the promise I made to my father.</t136><t137>"</t137>
<t138>And how!</t138> <t139>To be honest, I have a belief that your father did not mean for you to give them money or anything like that.</t139> <t140>I think the help he had in mind was the kind that could reasonably be expected from you; for example, finding them a small, comfortable house, helping them move, sending them meat and fish according to the season, and so on.</t140> <t141>I swear he didn't mean anything more; because it would be strange and unreasonable if he did.</t141> <t142>Just think, Mr. Dashwood, darling, with the interest from seven thousand pounds, your stepmother and her daughters would live in such great comfort, plus each girl has her own thousand pounds, from which they get fifty pounds each and of course give it to their mother for kitchen expenses.</t142> <t143>If you add it up, they have five hundred pounds a year; I mean, really, what more could four women do with that?</t143> <t144>-They will live very cheaply!</t144> <t145>What is it to run a house?</t145> <t146>They have no carriages, no horses, no proper servants; there's no one with them; they can't spend a penny!</t146> <t147>Look how comfortable they will be!</t147> <t148>Five hundred a year!</t148> <t149>I don't think they could even spend half of it; as for you giving them more, it's ridiculous to even think about it.</t149> <t150>They should be giving to you instead.</t150><t151>"</t151>
<t152>"Well," said Mr. Dashwood, "you are absolutely right.</t152> <t153>My father could not have asked more from me than what you have said.</t153> <t154>Now I understand better; I will fulfill my commitment to them by helping and guiding them as you mentioned.</t154> <t155>When my mother moves to another house, I will give her all the support I can to settle in.</t155> <t156>A small gift of furniture would also be reasonable at that time.</t156><t157>"</t157>
<t158>"Of course," replied Mrs. John Dashwood.</t158> <t159>"But still, one thing must be kept in mind.</t159> <t160>When your father and mother moved to Norland, although the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the porcelain, silver, and bedding sets were preserved and now belong to your mother.</t160> <t161>So when she moves to her new home, everything will be complete.</t161><t162>"</t162>
<t163>"This must definitely be kept in mind.</t163> <t164>Truly a valuable inheritance! In fact, some of the silverware would make a nice addition to our own set.</t164><t165>"</t165>
<t166>"Yes indeed; the porcelain breakfast set is twice as nice as the one in this house.</t166> <t167>Also, I would say it's too nice for the kind of house they could afford.</t167> <t168>But what can we do.</t168> <t169>Your father only thought of them.</t169> <t170>I must also add this: you owe your father no gratitude, you have no obligations to his requests, because, as you know, if he could, he would leave everything in the world to them.</t170><t171>"</t171>
<t172>These were irresistible observations.</t172> <t173>They added a previously missing determination to Mr. John Dashwood's thoughts; and Mr. John Dashwood finally decided that doing more than the neighborly gestures his wife had pointed out for his father's widow and children would be, if not highly improper, certainly unnecessary.</t173>
<t174>Mrs. Dashwood stayed at Norland for a few months, and although the images that had imprinted on her mind no longer evoked the same intense emotions after a while, it wasn't that she didn't feel the desire to move; on the contrary, as her spirits began to lift and she became able to engage with things other than sorrowful memories that only heightened her grief, she grew impatient to leave, and since it was impossible to move away from that beloved land, she embarked on a relentless search to find a suitable place in the vicinity of Norland.</t174> <t175>However, she couldn't find a place that both met her desires for comfort and practicality and also suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, who persistently rejected several houses that she liked as being too large for their income.</t175>
<t176>Mrs. Dashwood had learned of the meaningful promise her husband had received from his son, which had relieved him of his final worldly concerns.</t176> <t177>She had no more doubt about the sincerity of this assurance than her husband had, and she welcomed it on behalf of her daughters, believing that even an income much less than seven thousand pounds would be more than sufficient for her.</t177> <t178>She was glad for the young man as their brother and for himself; she regretted not having previously acknowledged his goodness and for believing him to be lacking in generosity.</t178> <t179>Seeing the close interest he showed in her and her daughters, she concluded that their well-being was important to him and firmly believed for a long time that he harbored generous thoughts.</t179>
<t180>At the beginning of their acquaintance, the coldness she felt towards her daughter-in-law only increased after living with her family for half a year and getting to know her character better; despite all of Mrs. Dashwood's kindness and motherliness, the two women might have found it impossible to live together for so long, but a situation arose where Mrs. Dashwood thought it was very important for her daughter to continue staying at Norland.</t180>
<t181>The situation was the increasing closeness between her eldest daughter and Mrs. John Dashwood's brother; the young man was a gentlemanly, pleasant person; he had been introduced to them shortly after his sister settled in Norland, and since then he had spent most of his time there.</t181>
<t182>Some mothers might encourage this closeness out of a sense of self-interest, because Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a very wealthy deceased man; others might discourage it out of prudence, because except for a small amount, the young man's entire fortune was subject to his mother's will.</t182> <t183>But Mrs. Dashwood was not influenced by either thought.</t183> <t184>The young man's charm, his apparent affection for her daughter, and Elinor's reciprocation of this interest were enough for her.</t184> <t185>The idea that a difference in wealth could separate a couple brought together by similarity of temperament was contrary to all her beliefs; moreover, in her understanding, it was impossible for anyone who knew Elinor's virtues not to appreciate them.</t185>
<t186>Edward Ferrars did not win their favor through any particular charm of appearance or behavior.</t186> <t187>He was not handsome; his manners required familiarity to be pleasing.</t187> <t188>He was too shy to do himself justice; but when he overcame his natural bashfulness, his behavior showed every sign of an open, affectionate heart.</t188> <t189>He had a good mind; his education had given him a solid foundation.</t189> <t190>But neither in talent nor temperament was he in a position to fulfill the wishes of his mother and sister, who wanted to see him distinguished in a way they themselves did not fully understand.</t190> <t191>They wanted him to stand out in the world in one way or another.</t191> <t192>His mother wanted him to enter politics, to get into Parliament, to associate with the great men of the age.</t192> <t193>Mrs. John Dashwood wanted the same; but in the meantime, seeing him in a four-horse carriage would also satisfy her ambitions.</t193> <t194>But Edward had no inclination towards great men or four-horse carriages.</t194> <t195>All his wishes were centered on a quiet, peaceful home life.</t195> <t196>Fortunately, he had a younger brother who showed more promise for the future.</t196>
<t197>When Edward caught Mrs. Dashwood's attention, he had been staying at home for a few weeks; at that time, Mrs. Dashwood was in a distress that made her inattentive to her surroundings.</t197> <t198>She only saw that the young man was calm and attentive, and she liked him for that.</t198> <t199>He did not disturb her inner anguish with untimely conversations.</t199> <t200>Her better observation and appreciation of him came about one day when Elinor happened to mention the difference between him and her sister.</t200> <t201>This difference made her take him seriously in the most effective manner.</t201>
<t202>"It's enough," he said, "it's enough to say she doesn't resemble Fanny.</t202> <t203>This expresses all good qualities.</t203> <t204>I've already grown fond of the child.</t204><t205>"</t205>
<t206>"Once you get to know him better," said Elinor, "I think you will like him."</t206> <t207>"</t207>
<t208>"Like!" her mother replied, smiling.</t208> <t209>"I cannot feel a more positive emotion lighter than love.</t209><t210>"</t210>
<t211>"You might like it.</t211><t212>"</t212>
<t213>"I never understood the difference between liking and loving.</t213><t214>"</t214>
<t215>Mrs. Dashwood then endeavored to get to know the young man.</t215> <t216>Her actions were sincere and immediately dispelled the young man's apprehensions.</t216> <t217>She quickly grasped all of the young man's virtues; perhaps her ability to perceive was heightened by seeing the importance he placed on Elinor; but she was truly convinced of the young man's worth: even the calmness of his demeanor, which was contrary to all her established ideas of how a young man's manners should be, no longer seemed strange once she understood that his heart was warm and his disposition was kind.</t217>
<t218>As soon as he saw signs of love in his behavior towards Elinor, he took it for granted that they would enter into a serious relationship and began to look forward to their rapidly approaching wedding.</t218>
<t219>"In a few months, my dear Marianne," he said, "Elinor will definitely be married.</t219> <t220>We will miss her, but she will be happy.</t220><t221>"</t221>
<t222>"Oh mom, what will we do without him?"</t222><t223>"</t223>
<t224>"My dear, it's not like we're going to be separated.</t224> <t225>At most, there will be a few miles between us, and we'll see each other every day.</t225> <t226>You'll also have a brother, a real, loving brother.</t226> <t227>I'm in awe of Edward's kindness.</t227> <t228>But you seem unhappy, Marianne; don't you approve of your sister's choice?</t228><t229>"</t229>
<t230>"Maybe," said Marianne, "I might be a little confused.</t230> <t231>Edward is very warm-hearted, I love him.</t231> <t232>But how should I say - he is not that kind of young man - I mean something is missing - his appearance is not striking; he lacks the elegance I expect in the man who would make my sister fall in love with him.</t232> <t233>He lacks that spirit, that fire in his eyes that express virtue and intelligence.</t233> <t234>Moreover, I fear, my dear mother, he is a tasteless person.</t234> <t235>He doesn't seem to have an interest in music; although he likes Elinor's paintings very much, it's not the appreciation of someone who can understand the value of the paintings.</t235> <t236>Even though he often shows interest while Elinor is painting, it's clear he doesn't understand the subject.</t236> <t237>He likes her as a lover, not as an expert.</t237> <t238>For me to be satisfied, these qualities must be combined.</t238> <t239>I cannot be happy with a man who doesn't share the same taste in everything with me.</t239> <t240>He must be able to enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must attract both of us.</t240> <t241>Oh, mother, how lifeless, how sluggish was Edward's style when he read to us last night!</t241> <t242>I felt very sorry for my sister.</t242> <t243>But she endured it with such fortitude, as if she wasn't even aware of it.</t243> <t244>I couldn't sit still, honestly.</t244> <t245>To hear those beautiful verses, which almost drive me mad with delight at every opportunity, read with such thick dullness, with such indifference! "</t245>
<t246>"Of course, if it were a simple, delicate prose, it would have done it more justice.</t246> <t247>At that moment, I thought so too; but you are the one who gave him Cowper.</t247><t248>"</t248>
<t249>"No, but mom, if Cowper isn't going to animate it! -well, tastes can change of course.</t249> <t250>Elinor doesn't feel like I do,</t250>
<t251>so she can ignore it and be happy with him.</t251> <t252>But if I were in love with him, hearing that he reads without passion would break my heart.</t252> <t253>Mother, the more I get to know the world, the more I believe that I will not meet a man whom I can truly love.</t253> <t254>I want a lot!</t254> <t255>He must possess all of Edward's virtues, and his personality and manners must adorn his kindness with every possible charm.</t255><t256>"</t256>
<t257>"Don't forget, my dear, you are not even seventeen yet.</t257> <t258>It is still too early in life to give up hope for such happiness.</t258> <t259>Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?</t259> <t260>Only in one respect, my dear Marianne, may your fate be different from mine.</t260><t261>"</t261>
<t262>Chapter IV</t262>
<t263>"Alas, Elinor," said Marianne, "Edward has no taste in art.</t263><t264>"</t264>
<t265>"Doesn't he have a taste for art," replied Elinor; "why do you think so?</t265> <t266>He doesn't paint himself, of course, but he greatly enjoys seeing what others have done; rest assured, his natural taste is not at all flawed, he just hasn't had the opportunity to develop it.</t266> <t267>If he had received training, he would have painted quite well.</t267> <t268>He doesn't have much confidence in his own opinions on such matters, so he doesn't want to express his views on paintings; but he has an innate sense of quality and a simple taste that generally guides him quite correctly.</t268><t269>"</t269>
<t270>Marianne was afraid of offending and said nothing more on the subject; but the kind of admiration she felt for the pictures Elinor mentioned and those done by others was far from the rapture that Marianne believed was the only true form of pleasure.</t270> <t271>Still, laughing inwardly at the mistake, she understood her sister's defense of Edward; it was this tendency that had led to the error.</t271>
<t272>"I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "that you do not find his general taste flawed.</t272> <t273>In fact, I suppose you do not, because you treat him with the utmost kindness, but if that were your opinion, I am sure you could not show him such courtesy.</t273><t274>"</t274>
<t275>Marianne did not know what to say.</t275> <t276>She could not hurt her sister's feelings for any reason, however, she could not say what she did not believe.</t276>
<t277>it was impossible to say.</t277> <t278>Finally, he answered like this:</t278>
<t279>"Elinor, don't be offended if I can't praise her virtues with the same sensitivity you do.</t279> <t280>I haven't had the chance to examine the finer details of her mind, inclinations, and tastes as closely as you have; but I am quite certain that she is kind-hearted and intelligent.</t280> <t281>She is an extremely valuable and charming person.</t281><t282>"</t282>
<t283>"Probably," replied Elinor with a smile, "close friends wouldn't complain about such a comment.</t283> <t284>You couldn't have expressed your thoughts more sincerely.</t284><t285>"</t285>
<t286>Marianne was pleased that her sister was so easily satisfied.</t286>
<t287>"Because he is intelligent and kind-hearted," Elinor continued, "no one who encounters him often enough to have a warm conversation can doubt that.</t287> <t288>The excellence of his intellect and principles can hide behind that shyness which often leads him to remain silent. You know him well enough to appreciate his undeniable worth.</t288> <t289>But as you say, due to strange circumstances, you have remained more unfamiliar with the finer details than I have.</t289> <t290>While you were busy showing interest in my mother, I was left alone with him many times.</t290> <t291>I saw him quite a bit, observed his feelings, listened to his views on literature and taste; I can say that he is generally well-educated, takes great pleasure in books, has a sparkling imagination, fair and accurate observations, and a delicate and pure taste.</t291> <t292>As he relaxes, he reveals himself more in every way, and his behavior and appearance change.</t292> <t293>At first glance, his appearance is of course not striking, but the extraordinary expression of his eyes and the charm of his facial features become noticeable.</t293> <t294>I now know him so well that I find him truly handsome, or at least handsome.</t294> <t295>What do you say, Marianne?</t295><t296>"</t296>
<t297>If it doesn't change, I will also find him handsome very soon, Elinor.</t297> <t298>When you told me to love him like a brother, I won't find more faults in him on his face than I now find in my heart.</t298><t299>"</t299>
<t300>Elinor was surprised by this explanation and regretted the warm feelings she had revealed when talking about the young man.</t300> <t301>She realized that she cared deeply for Edward.</t301> <t302>She believed that this care was mutual; but she needed more assurance to find Marianne's belief in their closeness reasonable.</t302> <t303>She knew that Marianne and her mother would believe in something they imagined in an instant - for them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect.</t303> <t304>She tried to explain the true nature of the matter to her sister.</t304>
<t305>"I won't try to deny that I like him a lot," she said; "I like him."</t305><t306>"</t306>
<t307>Here Marianne shouted rebelliously-</t307>
<t308>"To like! To be fond of! Heartless Elinor! Worse than heartless, she is ashamed to be otherwise.</t308> <t309>If you use those words again, I will leave the room that instant.</t309><t310>"</t310>
<t311>Elinor couldn't help but laugh.</t311> <t312>"I'm sorry," she said, "rest assured, I did not intend to offend you by speaking so calmly about my feelings.</t312> <t313>Believe that my feelings are stronger than I have explained; that is, believe that your virtues and the possibility - the hope - of you being interested in me can evoke as much as common sense or reason would allow.</t313> <t314>But do not believe beyond that.</t314> <t315>I am as sure as my own name that he likes me.</t315> <t316>But there are moments when I doubt the degree of it; do not be surprised that I refrain from encouraging my own inclination by assuming it to be more than it actually is until I fully understand his feelings.</t316> <t317>I have very little doubt - in fact, none - about his preference for me.</t317> <t318>But there are other things to consider besides his inclination.</t318> <t319>For one thing, he is far from being free.</t319> <t320>We do not know what his mother is like; but from what Fanny occasionally says about her character, we cannot think she is a pleasant person; if Edward wishes to marry a woman who does not have a great fortune or high position, he would be very mistaken if he does not know that many difficulties will arise.</t320><t321>"</t321>
<t322>Marianne's and her mother's imagination of reality</t322>
<t323>He was surprised to see how much he had exceeded.</t323>
<t324>"So you really haven't gotten engaged!" he said.</t324> <t325>"No matter, it will happen soon anyway.</t325> <t326>Besides, there are two benefits to this delay.</t326> <t327>I won't lose you so quickly, and Edward will have the opportunity to develop his natural interest in a special pursuit that is extraordinarily important for your future happiness.</t327> <t328>Oh, how sweet it would be if he were influenced by your genius and learned to paint himself!</t328><t329>"</t329>
<t330>Elinor had revealed her true opinion to her sister.</t330> <t331>She did not think her relationship with Edward was as rosy as Marianne believed.</t331> <t332>From time to time, the young man had a mood of unease which, if it did not indicate indifference, spoke of something almost as troubling.</t332> <t333>If he had any doubts about Elinor's feelings, it should have caused him nothing but discomfort.</t333> <t334>It was unlikely to be the cause of that frequent absent-mindedness that settled over him.</t334> <t335>A more plausible reason could be found in the reality of a dependency that forbade him from giving in to his feelings.</t335> <t336>She knew that unless he strictly adhered to his mother's views about his future, she neither treated him in a way that would make him comfortable at home nor gave him the confidence to establish a home of his own.</t336> <t337>After having such knowledge, it was impossible for Elinor to feel at ease about this matter.</t337> <t338>Even though her mother and sister were certain, she could not trust the outcome of Edward's interest in her.</t338> <t339>In fact, the longer they spent together, the more doubtful the nature of his interest seemed; sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it was nothing more than friendship.</t339>
<t340>Nevertheless, whatever the real boundaries were, it was enough to disturb, even (more so) irritate Edward when noticed by his sister. At the first opportunity, she would torment her mother-in-law by elaborately describing her brother's great hopes, Mrs. Ferrars' determination to secure good marriages for both of her sons, and the dangers awaiting any young woman who might attempt to win him over, to such an extent that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unaware nor try to remain calm.</t340> <t341>She would give a response showing her disgust and leave the room at that moment, deciding to leave immediately, no matter the cost, to avoid subjecting her dear Elinor to those insults for another week.</t341>
<t342>In this state of mind, a letter arrived for her in the mail; it contained a very well-timed offer.</t342><t343>It was an offer for a small house under very comfortable conditions; the house belonged to a relative of importance and property in Devonshire.</t343><t344>The letter came directly from the gentleman himself and was written in a spirit of genuine friendship and benevolence.</t344><t345>The gentleman had learned that she needed a house, and although the house he was offering was just a cottage, he assured her that everything necessary would be done as long as she liked the environment.</t345><t346>After providing details of the house and garden, he insisted that she come to his residence, Barton Park, with her daughters; she could decide from there whether Barton Cottage, located in the same village, could be made comfortable for her with some modifications.</t346><t347>He seemed genuinely eager to help them; the entire letter was written in such a friendly manner that it did not fail to please her cousin, especially at a time when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behavior of her closer relatives.</t347><t348>She did not need time to think or investigate.</t348><t349>She made her decision while reading.</t349><t350>The location of Barton, in a county as far from Sussex as Devonshire, which until a few hours ago would have been a sufficient reason to invalidate all possible advantages of the place, now became its most important feature.</t350><t351>Leaving the Norland area no longer seemed bad; it had become desirable; compared to the ongoing misery of her daughter-in-law's hospitality, it was a blessing; leaving that beloved place forever would be less painful than staying there or visiting it as long as such a woman was its mistress.</t351><t352>She immediately wrote to Sir John Middleton, expressing her appreciation for his kindness and accepting his offer; then, in a rush, she showed both letters to her daughters to get their approval before sending her response.</t352>
<t353>Elinor had always thought it would be wiser for them to settle a little farther from Norland rather than being among those people all the time.</t353> <t354>Therefore, she did not object to her mother's intention to move to Devonshire.</t354> <t355>The house, as described by Sir John, was so modest in size and so reasonably priced that it left her no grounds to object on those matters either; thus, even though it wasn't a plan that excited her dreams, and despite it being a departure from Norland contrary to her wishes, she did not try to dissuade her mother from sending the acceptance letter.</t355>
<t356>As soon as she sent her reply, Mrs. Dashwood took great pleasure in informing her stepson and his wife that she had secured a house and that she would not trouble them once everything was ready for her use.</t356> <t357>They listened to her in astonishment. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband politely expressed his hope that they would not settle too far from Norland.</t357> <t358>Mrs. Dashwood replied with great pleasure that she would be going to Devonshire.</t358> <t359>Upon hearing this, Edward turned to her in a fluster and, in a voice that was not at all strange in its surprise and concern, repeated, "Devonshire!</t359> <t360>Are you really going there?</t360> <t361>So far from here!</t361> <t362>Which part exactly?" Mrs. Dashwood described the location.</t362> <t363>It was four miles north of Exeter.</t363>
<t364>"Just a cabin," he continued, "but I hope to see many of my friends there.</t364> <t365>A couple of rooms can easily be added; if my friends don't mind traveling to see me, I won't mind hosting them.</t365><t366>"</t366>
<t367>He concluded his words by very politely inviting Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit Barton; he extended a separate invitation to Edward with even greater affection.</t367> <t368>Although his last conversation with his daughter-in-law had led him to decide not to stay at Norland any longer than absolutely necessary, it had not influenced her in the matter he primarily intended.</t368> <t369>Separating Elinor and Edward was still as far from being her goal as ever.</t369>
<t370>and with this obvious invitation to her brother, she did not care at all whether Mrs. John Dashwood approved of the marriage or not</t370>
<t371>he was eager to show.</t371>
<t372>Mr. John Dashwood repeatedly expressed how sorry he was that he had taken a house too far away to help with the transportation of the furniture from Norland.</t372> <t373>The situation really troubled his conscience; because the action that defined the scope of the promise he made to his father became practically impossible in this case.</t373> <t374>The furniture was sent by sea.</t374> <t375>It consisted of bedding, dishes, porcelain, and books; there was also Marianne's beautiful piano.</t375> <t376>Mrs. John Dashwood watched the departure of the packages with a sigh: despite their own income being far greater than Mrs. Dashwood's, she couldn't help but resent that Mrs. Dashwood had such beautiful furniture.</t376>
<t377>Mrs. Dashwood rented it for twelve months; the house was well-maintained and could be moved into immediately.</t377> <t378>There were no difficulties on either side regarding the contract; she only waited for her belongings to be cleared out of Norland before setting off westward to establish her new home, which was quickly done as she was extremely swift in attending to everything that concerned her.</t378> <t379>The horses her husband had left her were sold immediately after his death; now, upon receiving an offer to sell her carriage, she agreed to do so following the persistent advice of her eldest daughter.</t379> <t380>If it were up to her, she would have kept the carriage for the comfort of her children; but Elinor's decision prevailed.</t380> <t381>Again, it was her wisdom that limited the number of servants in their household to three; two maids and a footman, quickly chosen from among those who had formed their establishment at Norland.</t381>
<t382>One of the servants was immediately sent to Devonshire to prepare the house for their mistresses' arrival; because Mrs. Dashwood, not knowing Lady Middleton, preferred to go directly to the cottage rather than be a guest at Barton Park; she trusted Sir John's directions to the house so unquestioningly that she did not even feel the desire to take a closer look until she set foot in it as her own home.</t382> <t383>Her desire to leave Norland was not diminished at all by her daughter-in-law's obvious satisfaction at her departure - a satisfaction that was only lightly veiled under a cold invitation to delay her departure.</t383> <t384>Now was the time for her stepson to fulfill the promise he had made to his father in due form.</t384> <t385>Since he had neglected to do this when he first arrived at the mansion, their departure could be seen as the most appropriate time to fulfill the promise.</t385> <t386>But Mrs. Dashwood soon began to give up all such hopes and to understand from the general flow of his conversation that the help he would provide would not extend beyond sustaining their six-month stay at Norland.</t386> <t387>He spoke so often of the increase in household expenses and the endless, countless demands on his purse that, far from giving money, he himself seemed to be in need of it.</t387>
<t388>Just a few weeks after Sir John Middleton's first letter arrived at Norland, everything in their future home was prepared in a way that allowed Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to start their journey.</t388>
<t389>They shed many tears as they bid their final farewell to a place they loved so much.</t389> <t390>"Dear Norland!" said Marianne, wandering alone in front of the house on the last evening of their life there, "when will I stop missing you! -to feel another place like my home!</t390> <t391>-Oh, happy home, can you imagine how it pains me to look at you from here now, knowing I won't be able to look from this point again!</t391> <t392>-And you, oh dear trees!</t392> <t393>-but you will continue this life.</t393> <t394>Not a single leaf will fall because we are gone, not a single branch will stop swaying because we can no longer look at you!</t394> <t395>-No; you will continue this life; indifferent to the pleasure or pain of what has happened, not caring who walks in your shade!</t395> <t396>-But who will be left to enjoy you?</t396><t397>"</t397>
<t398>The first part of their journey passed in a melancholic mood that was too dull and unpleasant to bear.</t398> <t399>But as they approached the end of the road, their interest in the appearance of the environment they would live in erased their sorrow, and the view they saw as they entered Barton Valley brought them joy.</t399> <t400>It was a charming, fertile land, abundant with trees and wide meadows.</t400> <t401>At the end of a winding road over a mile long, they reached their own home.</t401> <t402>In front of the house, there was a small green courtyard; they entered the courtyard through a well-kept, small gate.</t402>
<t403>The Barton Cottage was comfortable and tidy as a house; but it was flawed as a cottage, because the building was neat, the roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, and the walls were not covered with honeysuckles.</t403> <t404>A narrow corridor led straight from the inside of the house to the backyard.</t404> <t405>On either side of the entrance, there were sitting rooms of approximately six square meters each; behind the rooms were study rooms and a staircase.</t405> <t406>The rest of the house consisted of four bedrooms and two closets.</t406> <t407>It had not been built long ago and had seen good repairs.</t407> <t408>Compared to Norland, it was indeed poor and small! -but the tears caused by the memory dried up quickly as they entered the house.</t408> <t409>The servants, who were happy about their arrival, cheered them up, and everyone tried to appear happy for the sake of the others.</t409> <t410>It was the very beginning of September; it was a warm season, and from the moment they first saw the surroundings in the beautiful weather, they formed a positive impression of the place, which greatly influenced their lasting affection for it.</t410>
<t411>The location of the house was good.</t411> <t412>High hills rose immediately behind it and were not far off on either side; some were open slopes, others were cultivated and wooded.</t412> <t413>The village of Barton was mostly situated on top of one of these hills and provided a pleasant view from the cottage windows.</t413> <t414>The view at the front was more expansive; it overlooked the entire valley and extended to the distant fields.</t414> <t415>The hills surrounding the cottage ended the valley in that direction; under another name and in another direction, the valley split again between the two steepest hills.</t415>
<t416>Mrs. Dashwood was generally pleased with the spaciousness and furnishing of the house; although the old lifestyle required many additions to the new one, she enjoyed making those additions and improvements; at that time, she had enough money on hand to buy everything needed to add more elegance to the rooms.</t416> <t417>"As for the house itself, of course," she said, "it is very small for our family, but for now, we will make ourselves as comfortable as possible, because it is too late in the year for renovations.</t417> <t418>Perhaps by spring, if I have a lot of money, which I think I will, we can consider construction.</t418> <t419>These living rooms are too small for our friendly gatherings, as I want to see my friends gathered here often; I have the idea of incorporating the hallway into one of the rooms, leaving the rest as an entrance; a new living room that can be easily added, along with a bedroom and a closet upstairs, would make this a cozy little cottage.</t419> <t420>I wish the staircase were nice.</t420> <t421>But one shouldn't expect everything; still, it probably wouldn't be hard to widen the staircase.</t421> <t422>Let's see what I have by spring, and we will plan our renovations accordingly.</t422><t423>"</t423>
<t424>Meanwhile, a woman with an annual income of five hundred pounds, who had never saved in her life, had the sense to accept the house as it was until all these changes were made; each of them was busy creating a home for themselves by arranging their belongings and books around according to their own personal taste.</t424> <t425>Marianne's piano was opened and nicely placed; Elinor's paintings were hung on the walls of the living room.</t425>
<t426>The next day, immediately after breakfast, these activities were interrupted by the arrival of the hosts; Barton had come to welcome them and to offer them whatever they did not yet have from his own house and garden.</t426> <t427>Sir John Middleton was a handsome man in his forties.</t427> <t428>He had once visited Stanhill, but it was so long ago that his young cousins could not remember him.</t428> <t429>There was a friendly expression on his face; his manners were as amiable as the style of his letter.</t429> <t430>He seemed genuinely happy about their arrival; making them comfortable was a real concern for him.</t430> <t431>He frequently expressed his desire for them to live as closely as possible with his own family and insisted so much that they come to Barton Park for dinner every day until they were well settled in, that although his insistence bordered on overstepping the bounds of politeness, it was impossible to take offense.</t431> <t432>His kindness was not limited to words; for within an hour of leaving them, a large basket of vegetables and fruits arrived from the Park, followed by a gift of game before sunset.</t432> <t433>He also insisted on taking their letters to and from the post on their behalf; of course, he would not deprive them of the pleasure of receiving their daily newspapers either.</t433>
<t434>Lady Middleton had sent a very polite message, expressing her desire to visit Mrs. Dashwood at her earliest convenience; this message was answered with an equally polite invitation, so her ladyship was presented to them the next day.</t434>
<t435>It was certainly exciting for them to see the person to whom they owed much of their comfort in Barton; the elegance in her appearance was exactly to their liking.</t435> <t436>Lady Middleton was no more than twenty-six or twenty-seven years old; her face was beautiful, her body tall and striking, and her speech was gentle.</t436> <t437>All the grace that was lacking in her husband was present in her movements.</t437> <t438>But if she shared a bit of her husband's sincerity and warmth, her elegance would have been even greater; her visit lasted long enough to diminish their initial admiration by revealing that she was a well-bred but distant and cold person, with nothing to say beyond the most ordinary questions and answers.</t438>
<t439>Nevertheless, the conversation did not lag, because Sir John was very talkative, and Lady Middleton had prudently brought along their eldest child, a charming six-year-old boy; thanks to him, there was always a topic to fall back on in case of emergency; they asked his name and age, admired his beauty, and asked questions on his behalf, which his mother answered; meanwhile, the boy leaned against his mother and bowed his head, much to the surprise of her ladyship, who could not understand why he was so shy in front of people when he was so boisterous at home.</t439> <t440>In every formal visit, a child should be part of the entourage to prevent a shortage of topics.</t440> <t441>During this visit, it took a comfortable ten minutes to determine whether the boy loved his father or mother more, and which of his features resembled whom, as everyone had a different opinion and was quite surprised by everyone else's opinion.</t441>
<t442>It wasn't long before the Dashwoods were given the opportunity to express their opinions about the other children as well, because Sir John would not leave without getting a promise to come to dinner at the Park the next day.</t442>
<t443>Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.</t443> <t444>The ladies had passed close by it on their way down the valley, but it was hidden from them by the hill.</t444> <t445>The house was large and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance.</t445> <t446>The hospitality was for Sir John's pleasure, and the elegance for that of his lady.</t446> <t447>It was seldom that they were without some friends staying with them in the house; and they were always inclined to invite more acquaintances than any other family in the neighborhood.</t447> <t448>This was necessary for both their happiness; for though their temperaments and tastes were different, they strongly resembled each other in that absolute lack of talent and taste which confined their pursuits to a very narrow range of social duties.</t448> <t449>Sir John was a sportsman, Lady Middleton was a mother.</t449> <t450>Sir John hunted and shot, while Lady Middleton amused her children; these were their only resources.</t450> <t451>Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all year round, while Sir John's free pursuits were only possible for half the year.</t451> <t452>Nevertheless, the constant pursuit of company both at home and abroad compensated for all the deficiencies of nature and education; it kept Sir John in good spirits, and gave his wife the opportunity to display her social graces.</t452>
<t453>Lady Middleton took pride in the elegance of her table and all the arrangements she made in her home; she derived the greatest pleasure from this sense of display during the parties she hosted.</t453> <t454>But the enjoyment Sir John derived from people was much more genuine; he delighted in gathering more young people around him than his house could accommodate, and the noisier they were, the better.</t454> <t455>He was a blessing for the younger generation in the vicinity; in the summer, he would constantly organize outdoor cold ham and chicken parties, and in the winter, he would host private balls frequently enough to satisfy every young lady not suffering from the insatiable appetite of fifteen years old.</t455>
<t456>Having a new family move into the neighborhood was always a source of joy for him, and now the tenants he had found for his cottage in Barton charmed him in every way.</t456> <t457>The young Dashwoods were beautiful and simple girls.</t457> <t458>This was enough to win his favor, because to make a beautiful girl appear as charming to his soul, all she needed was to be simple.</t458> <t459>Sir John's friendly disposition made him happy to provide shelter for these people whose circumstances could be considered unfortunate compared to the past.</t459> <t460>Therefore, he felt genuine satisfaction in showing kindness to his cousins; he also felt all the satisfaction a hunter could feel by placing a family consisting only of ladies in his cottage; because although a hunter only respects his fellow hunters, he is not very keen on encouraging their pleasures by allowing them to reside in his own village.</t460>
<t461>Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were greeted at the door by Sir John and were warmly welcomed to Barton Park with simple sincerity; as he accompanied the young ladies to the sitting room, he reiterated his regret at not being able to introduce them to the charming young men he had mentioned the previous day.</t461> <t462>He told them that they would only see one other gentleman there besides himself; it was a friend staying at the Park, but he was neither very young nor very cheerful.</t462> <t463>He hoped they would excuse the small size of the gathering and assured them that it would not happen again.</t463> <t464>In the hope of increasing the number, he had visited several families that morning, but since there would be moonlight that night, everyone had prior engagements.</t464> <t465>Fortunately, at the last moment, Lady Middleton's mother</t465>
<t466>She had come to Barton and, being a very cheerful and agreeable woman, Sir John hoped that the young ladies would not find the gathering as dull as they had thought.</t466> <t467>The young ladies and their mothers were quite satisfied with the presence of two strangers in the group, and did not want anything more.</t467>
<t468>Lady Middleton's mother, Mrs. Jennings, was a good-natured, cheerful, plump, elderly woman; she talked a lot, appeared very happy, and was somewhat coarse.</t468> <t469>She was full of jokes and laughter, and before the meal was over, she had made many playful remarks about lovers and husbands; she hoped they had not left their hearts behind in Sussex and pretended to see their faces blush without waiting for their reactions.</t469> <t470>Marianne was annoyed on her sister's behalf; she turned her eyes to Elinor to see how she endured these attacks, and did so with such insistence that it caused Elinor much more pain than a simple jest from Mrs. Jennings could have.</t470>
<t471>Colonel Brandon, Sir John's friend, did not seem at all suitable to be his friend in terms of behavior similarity, just as Lady Middleton did not seem suitable to be his wife or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.</t471> <t472>He was quiet and serious.</t472> <t473>However, although he was over thirty-five and thus a confirmed bachelor in the eyes of Marianne and Margaret, his appearance was not unpleasant; his face, though not handsome, had regular features, and his speech was very gentlemanly.</t473>
<t474>There was nothing in the group that suggested they could be friends with the Dashwoods; but Lady Middleton's cold stillness was so repulsive that, in comparison, Colonel Brandon's seriousness, or even the clamor of Sir John and his mother-in-law, seemed reasonable.</t474> <t475>Lady Middleton only appeared to come to life when her four noisy children entered the room after dinner; they tugged at her, tore her dress, and put an end to any conversation that did not concern them.</t475>
<t476>In the evening, when it was discovered that Marianne had musical talent, she was invited to play the piano.</t476> <t477>The piano was unlocked, everyone prepared to enjoy themselves, and Marianne, who sang beautifully, read most of the songs that had clearly been left on the piano since the day Lady Middleton, according to her mother, had brought it into the family upon her marriage, and according to Lady Middleton herself, had celebrated her marriage by giving up music, although she had once played the piano exceptionally well and loved it dearly.</t477>
<t478>Marianne's performance was highly applauded.</t478> <t479>Sir John, who was chatting loudly with those next to him while the song was being sung, shouted his appreciation at the end of the song just as loudly.</t479> <t480>Lady Middleton, astonished that anyone could let their attention stray from the music even for a moment, frequently warned him and asked Marianne to sing a song she had just performed.</t480> <t481>Among the entire group, only Colonel Brandon listened to her without losing himself.</t481> <t482>He complimented Marianne by giving her his full attention; in an environment where the others shamelessly disregarded the music with tastelessness, Marianne respected him for this reason.</t482> <t483>The pleasure he derived from the music did not reach the sublime level of her own, but it was noteworthy compared to the appalling indifference of the others; Marianne was understanding enough to accept that a thirty-five-year-old man might have left behind the sharp feelings and exceptional capacity for enjoyment.</t483> <t484>Out of humanity, she was quite willing to overlook the advanced stage of the Colonel's life.</t484>
<t485>Mrs. Jennings was a widow; she had a fortune of her own.</t485> <t486>She had only two daughters; she had lived long enough to see both of them make respectable marriages, and now she had nothing left to do but to marry off the rest of the world.</t486> <t487>She had devoted herself to this purpose with all her might; she never missed an opportunity to make marriage plans among the young people she knew.</t487> <t488>She was extremely quick at sensing inclinations and had delighted in using the privilege of making many young women blush and swell with pride by hinting at the influence of such and such a young man over them; this talent allowed her to declare, soon after arriving at Barton, that Colonel Brandon was head over heels in love with Marianne Dashwood.</t488> <t489>She had suspected it the first evening they were together when he listened to Marianne sing so attentively; the situation was confirmed when he listened to her again when the Middletons returned the visit by dining at the cottage.</t489> <t490>It had to be so.</t490> <t491>She was as sure of it as she was of her own name.</t491> <t492>It would be a wonderful marriage, for the man was rich and the girl was beautiful.</t492> <t493>Since she had known Colonel Brandon through her connection with Sir John, Mrs. Jennings had very much wanted to see him make a good marriage; indeed, she had always enjoyed finding a good husband for every pretty girl.</t493>
<t494>The benefits it provided him were not insignificant either, because it gave him endless opportunities to make jokes about both.</t494>
<t495>He laughed at the Colonel in the park, at Marianne in the cabin.</t495> <t496>His sarcastic remarks probably did not affect the Colonel at all from his own perspective; to the other, they initially seemed vague, but once the intention was understood, she didn't know whether to laugh at the absurdity or be angry at the impudence, because she thought it was disrespectful given the Colonel's advanced age and his hopeless state as a chronic bachelor.</t496>
<t497>Mrs. Dashwood, who did not find a man five years younger than herself to be as excessively old as he appeared to her daughter's youthful mind, was unwilling to accept the possibility that Mrs. Jennings might be making a joke about the man's age.</t497>
<t498>"But mother, even if you don't think it was intentional malice, you can't deny the oddity of the accusation.</t498> <t499>Colonel Brandon is clearly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he's old enough to be my father; even if he once had the energy to fall in love, he's now at an age where he would have forgotten such feelings.</t499> <t500>So ridiculous! If being old and crippled isn't enough, what protects a person from such mockery?</t500><t501>"</t501>
<t502>"Crippled!" said Elinor, "Are you calling Colonel Brandon crippled?</t502> <t503>I can guess that he seems much older to you than my mother, but you can't delude yourself into thinking he can't still use his hands and feet!</t503><t504>"</t504>
<t505>"Didn't you hear that he complained about rheumatism? Isn't this the most typical sign of old age?"</t505><t506>"</t506>
<t507>"My dear child," said her mother, laughing, "then you must be terrified every moment thinking that I am decaying and going away; so it seems like a miracle to you that I have reached the age of forty.</t507><t508>"</t508>
<t509>"Mom, you don't understand me.</t509> <t510>I know that Colonel Brandon is not so old that his friends think they will lose him any day now.</t510> <t511>He could live another twenty years.</t511> <t512>But thirty-five is no age for marriage anymore.</t512><t513>"</t513>
<t514>"Maybe," said Elinor, "a thirty-five-year-old and a seventeen-year-old should not be in the same marriage.</t514> <t515>But if there is a woman who is still single at twenty-seven, then I don't think anyone would object to Colonel Brandon marrying her.</t515><t516>"</t516>
<t517>"A twenty-seven-year-old woman," said Marianne, after thinking for a moment, "can no longer expect to excite anyone; if her home is uncomfortable, if her income is small, I think she can consent to a job like caregiving, at least she would be as secure as if she were married.</t517> <t518>It would not be inappropriate at all for Colonel Brandon to marry such a woman.</t518> <t519>It would be quite useful, and everyone would be pleased.</t519> <t520>In my eyes, this marriage wouldn't happen; but let it not happen.</t520> <t521>I think it would just be a commercial transaction based on mutual interest.</t521><t522>"</t522>
<t523>"It would be impossible for me," replied Elinor, "to convince you that a twenty-seven-year-old woman could feel something close to love for a thirty-five-year-old man, that she could see him as a charming life companion, I know.</t523> <t524>But I must object to you confining poor Colonel Brandon to the sick room just because he complained of a slight rheumatic pain in his shoulder yesterday (and it was a very cold, damp day).</t524><t525>"</t525>
<t526>"But he talked about wearing an undershirt," said Marianne, "to me, an undershirt brings to mind pains, cramps, rheumatisms, and other ailments that plague the elderly and the weak.</t526><t527>"</t527>
<t528>"If he only had a high fever, you wouldn't belittle him even half as much.</t528> <t529>Admit it, Marianne, isn't there something that attracts you in the flushed cheeks, glazed eyes, and rapid pulse of someone with a high fever?</t529><t530>"</t530>
<t531>Right after Elinor left the room, "Mother," said Marianne, "I have a concern about an illness that I must share with you.</t531> <t532>I am certain that Edward Ferrars is not well.</t532> <t533>It has been almost fifteen days since we came here, and he still hasn't come.</t533> <t534>Only a real obstacle could have caused this unusual delay.</t534> <t535>What else could keep him at Norland?</t535><t536>"</t536>
<t537>"Did you think he would come so quickly?" said Mrs. Dashwood.</t537> <t538>"I did not think so.</t538> <t539>On the contrary, if I had any concern about the matter, it was that he seemed a bit reluctant to accept my invitation when I mentioned the child's coming to Barton.</t539> <t540>Was Elinor expecting him?</t540><t541>"</t541>
<t542>"I never brought up the subject, but of course, they must be expecting it.</t542><t543>"</t543>
<t544>"I think you are mistaken, because when I talked about getting a new grill for the fireplace in the empty bedroom yesterday, he said there's no rush, the room won't be used for a while.</t544><t545>"</t545>
<t546>"How strange! What could this mean!</t546> <t547>But there is no explanation for their behavior towards each other!</t547> <t548>Their final farewell was so cold, so distant!</t548> <t549>Their conversation on the last evening they were together was so lifeless!</t549> <t550>If you look at Edward's farewell, there was no difference between Elinor and me; it was as if he was offering his good wishes to us both like a kind older brother.</t550> <t551>On the last morning, I left them alone twice, and inexplicably the child followed me outside both times.</t551> <t552>Elinor did not cry as much as I did about leaving Norland and Edward.</t552> <t553>Even now, there is no change in her calmness.</t553> <t554>When has she ever been sad or sorrowful?</t554> <t555>When has she ever avoided people, or appeared uncomfortable or uneasy in public?</t555><t556>"</t556>
<t557>The Dashwoods had now settled very comfortably in Barton.</t557> <t558>The house, the garden, all the objects around them now felt familiar; the daily occupations that had given Norland half its charm were resumed with much greater pleasure than Norland could offer after their father's loss.</t558> <t559>During the first fifteen days, Sir John Middleton, who visited them every day and was not used to seeing much occupation in the house, could not hide his admiration at always finding them busy.</t559>
<t560>They had few visitors outside the residents of Barton Park; because despite Sir John's persistent exhortations for them to mingle more with the neighbors and his repeated assurances that his carriage was at their disposal, Mrs. Dashwood's spirit of independence outweighed her need for society for her children; she resolutely refused every family visit beyond walking distance.</t560> <t561>And there were only a few families that could be so classified, and not all of them were accessible.</t561> <t562>About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow, winding Allenham valley that branched off from the previously described Barton valley, the girls had discovered an old, dignified-looking mansion on one of their first walks, which, reminding them a bit of Norland, captivated their imaginations and sparked a desire to know it better.</t562> <t563>But upon inquiry, they had learned that its owner, a very kind-hearted old lady, was unfortunately too ill to engage with the world and never left the house.</t563>
<t564>The surrounding land was filled with beautiful walking paths.</t564> <t565>From almost every window of the cabin, high slopes inviting them to enjoy the air at their peaks offered a pleasant alternative when the mud of the valleys below forbade superior beauties; on a fine morning, captivated by the allure of partial sunlight under a rainy sky and unable to endure the captivity caused by two days of incessant rain, Marianne and Margaret directed their steps towards one of these hills.</t565> <t566>Although Marianne said that the weather would not worsen throughout the day and that all the disturbing clouds had cleared from the peak, it was not enticing enough to pull the other two away from their pens and books; thus, the two girls set off together.</t566>
<t567>They descended the slopes with joy, feeling happy about the distance they covered every time they saw the blue sky; they regretted the fears that prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing these delightful feelings when they felt the invigorating breezes of the strong south-west wind on their faces.</t567>
<t568>"In the world," said Marianne, "is there a greater happiness than this?</t568> <t569>-Margaret, let's walk for at least two hours.</t569><t570>"</t570>
<t571>Margaret agreed; they continued on their way against the wind, laughing and playing, resisting the wind for another twenty minutes; then suddenly clouds gathered above and a heavy rain fell on them.</t571> <t572>They were surprised, saddened, and had to turn back despite not wanting to, because there was no shelter closer than their home.</t572> <t573>Still, there was something that consoled them, which seemed more reasonable in the necessity of that moment than ever; and that was to run down the steep slope that descended right to the gate of their garden with all their might.</t573>
<t574>They sprang into action.</t574> <t575>Marianne immediately moved forward, but when she took a wrong step, she suddenly fell to the ground; unable to stop herself to help her, Margaret continued running involuntarily and reached the flat ground safely.</t575>
<t576>A gentleman with a rifle, around whom two pointers were playing, was climbing up the slope and was only a few steps away from Marianne when the accident happened.</t576> <t577>He put down his rifle and ran to her aid.</t577> <t578>Marianne had gotten up from the ground, but her foot had twisted when she fell and she was having difficulty standing.</t578> <t579>The gentleman offered help, and realizing that she was refusing what her condition necessitated out of shyness, he immediately took her in his arms and carried her down the slope.</t579> <t580>Then he passed through the garden gate that Margaret had left open and brought her directly to the house, where Margaret had just arrived, and did not set her down until he placed her on a chair in the living room.</t580>
<t581>Elinor and her mother stood up in astonishment as they entered; their eyes fixed on them with evident amazement and a hidden admiration stemming from the gentleman's appearance, while the gentleman apologized for his uninvited arrival and explained the reason for his visit; his manner was so sincere and so elegant that his unusually handsome appearance gained an additional charm from his voice and expression.</t581> <t582>Even if he had been old, ugly, and rough, Mrs. Dashwood's gratitude and kindness would have been assured by the interest shown in her child; but the effect of youth, beauty, and grace added a distinction to the act that won her heart.</t582>
<t583>He thanked the gentleman repeatedly; with a grace that accompanied his every action, he invited him to sit down.</t583> <t584>But the gentleman declined because he was dirty and wet.</t584> <t585>Mrs. Dashwood then wanted to know to whom she owed her thanks.</t585> <t586>His name, said the gentleman, was Willoughby, he was currently staying at Allenham, and he hoped the lady would grant him permission to call on Miss Dashwood tomorrow to inquire about her health.</t586> <t587>Permission was immediately granted, and the gentleman, as if wanting to make himself even more interesting, departed under a heavy rain.</t587>
<t588>The gentleman's manly beauty and extraordinary grace suddenly became a subject of general admiration; the playfulness his daring created around Marianne gained a distinct spirit with the charm of his appearance.</t588> <t589>Marianne had seen his face less than the others, because the astonishment that flushed her face when he lifted her up had deprived her of the power to observe him after entering the house.</t589> <t590>But she had seen enough to join in the admiration of the others, and with an energy that always adorned her praises.</t590> <t591>The gentleman's face and demeanor were equal to what her imagination had drawn for the hero of her favorite story; there was a speed of thought in his carrying her into the house without much regard for formality, which made the action particularly appealing.</t591> <t592>Every detail about the gentleman was intriguing.</t592> <t593>His name was good, his house was in the village they loved; Marianne soon realized that the most charming of all men's attire was the hunting jacket.</t593> <t594>Her imagination was occupied, her thoughts were pleasant, and she ignored the pain of her sprained ankle.</t594>
<t595>Sir John visited them as soon as the weather cleared up again the next morning and he was allowed to go out; he was told about Marianne's accident and was asked if he knew a gentleman named Willoughby at Allenham.</t595>
<t596>"Willoughby!" cried Sir John; "you mean, he's in the village now?</t596> <t597>This is good news; I'll go there tomorrow and invite him for dinner on Thursday.</t597><t598>"</t598>
<t599>"So you know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood.</t599>
<t600>"Know him?</t600> <t601>Of course, I know him.</t601> <t602>He comes here every year.</t602><t603>"</t603>
<t604>"What kind of person is he/she?"</t604><t605>"</t605>
<t606>"One of the best, rest assured.</t606> <t607>A very good marksman; there is no braver rider in England.</t607><t608>"</t608>
<t609>"Is that all you can say for him?" Marianne cried, angrily.</t609> <t610>"What is his behavior like when you get to know him better?</t610> <t611>What are his tastes, talents, and virtues?</t611><t612>"</t612>
<t613>Sir John was a bit surprised.</t613>
<t614>"Well," he said, "I don't know about that.</t614> <t615>But sir, he is a well-mannered man; his is the most beautiful black female pointer I have ever seen.</t615> <t616>Was she with him today too?</t616><t617>"</t617>
<t618>But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the color of Mr. Willoughby's pointer than he could satisfy her as to the details of Mr. Willoughby's character.</t618>
<t619>"But who is he?" said Elinor.</t619> <t620>"Where is he from? Does he have a house in Allenham?"</t620><t621>"</t621>
<t622>On this matter, Sir John could provide more precise information; he told them that Mr. Willoughby did not own any property in the village, and that he only stayed there when he came to visit an elderly lady at Allenham Court, who was his relative and whose estate he was the heir to. He added, "Yes, yes, I can say he is someone worth catching, Miss Dashwood; besides, he also has a small, lovely estate in Somersetshire. If I were you, despite all these falling down the hill incidents, I wouldn't leave him to my sister."</t622> <t623>Miss Marianne should not hope to keep all the men to herself.</t623> <t624>If she is not careful, she will make Brandon jealous.</t624><t625>"</t625>
<t626>"I do not believe, Mr. Willoughby," said Mrs. Dashwood, "that my daughters will be harassed by the kind of advances you mention.</t626> <t627>They were not raised in such a manner.</t627> <t628>No matter how wealthy they are, men are perfectly safe in our company. However, I am pleased to learn from your words that he is a respectable young man suitable for friendship.</t628><t629>"</t629>
<t630>"One of the best, in my opinion," repeated Sir John.</t630> <t631>"Last Christmas, at a small party in the Park, she danced from eight to four without sitting down once.</t631><t632>"</t632>
<t633>"Really?" Marianne exclaimed with sparkling eyes, "did it have grace, excitement?"</t633><t634>"</t634>
<t635>"Yes; moreover, he got up again at eight o'clock to go hunting.</t635><t636>"</t636>
<t637>"That's what I liked; a young man should be exactly like this.</t637> <t638>No matter what his occupation is, he should do it with boundless enthusiasm and not get tired.</t638><t639>"</t639>
<t640>"Look, look, the situation is understood," said Sir John, "the situation is well understood.</t640> <t641>Now you will try to woo him and you will not give poor Brandon any attention.</t641><t642>"</t642>
<t643>"From this expression, Sir John," said Marianne, in a warm voice, "I do not like it at all.</t643> <t644>I detest all vulgar phrases with irony; 'to catch someone' or 'to get someone' are the most disgusting.</t644> <t645>Their meanings are heavy and coarse; even if they were pleasing when invented, time has long since destroyed all their charm.</t645><t646>"</t646>
<t647>Sir John didn't quite understand this reproach; but he laughed heartily as if he did, and then replied,</t647>
<t648>"If you ask me, one way or another, you'll steal enough hearts.</t648> <t649>Poor Brandon! He's already quite smitten; despite all this stumbling and spraining, I can tell you that he is also quite worth wooing.</t649><t650>"</t650>
<t651>Although Margaret did not accurately but delicately call Willoughby Marianne's protector, he personally visited the cottage early the next morning to gather information.</t651> <t652>He was received very kindly by Mrs. Dashwood, with a warmth created by Sir John's accounts of him and her own gratitude; everything that happened during the visit convinced Willoughby that the family he had met by accident was sensible, kind, closely-knit, and well-off.</t652> <t653>He did not need a second meeting to be sure of their personal charms.</t653>
<t654>Miss Dashwood had a delicate face, well-defined features, and a body that was remarkably attractive.</t654> <t655>Marianne was even more beautiful.</t655> <t656>Although her body was not as proportionate as her sister's, she was more striking due to her height advantage; her face was so pleasant that in the common language of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, and the truth could not be less distorted than it usually is.</t656> <t657>Her complexion was quite brunette, but due to its clarity, her face was extraordinarily radiant; her features were well-defined; her smile was sweet and charming, and in her jet-black eyes, there was a life, a spirit, a willingness that could not be looked at without pleasure.</t657> <t658>The expression in her eyes was initially withheld from Willoughby due to the discomfort caused by remembering the help he had provided.</t658> <t659>But once the discomfort passed, and her cheerfulness returned, seeing that the gentleman combined sincere liveliness with perfect manners, especially his passionate love for music and dance,</t659>
<t660>When he heard that she said she was fond of it, he gave her such an approving look that ensured most of the conversation for the rest of the visit was directed towards him.</t660>
<t661>It was enough to mention any entertainment she liked to draw Marianne into a conversation.</t661> <t662>When these topics were brought up, she did not remain silent; she knew neither shyness nor limits in the discussion.</t662> <t663>They quickly discovered that their tastes in dance and music were mutual, which stemmed from a general consensus on every matter related to dance and music.</t663> <t664>Encouraged by this to delve deeper into Willoughby's preferences, Marianne began to question him about books; she mentioned her favorite authors and spoke of them with such rapturous delight that any sensible young man of twenty-five would be instantly captivated by the splendor of these works, even if he hadn't cared for them before.</t664> <t665>Their tastes were surprisingly similar.</t665> <t666>They both exalted the same books, the same passages - if there was any disagreement or objection, it vanished as soon as the strength of Marianne's opinions and the brightness of her eyes became apparent.</t666> <t667>Willoughby accepted all her judgments, matched all her enthusiasm; long before the visit was over, they conversed with the intimacy of old acquaintances.</t667>
<t668>"Hey Marianne," said Elinor, when the gentleman had left, "I think you did a very good job this morning.</t668> <t669>You learned what Mr. Willoughby thinks about almost every important matter.</t669> <t670>You know how he finds Cowper and Scott; you are sure that he appreciates their beauty properly; you have received every indication that he has a reasonable admiration for Pope.</t670> <t671>But if all conversation topics are brought up so hastily, how will you sustain your friendship for a long time?</t671> <t672>Soon you will exhaust every subject you love.</t672> <t673>The next meeting will be enough for the gentleman to explain his understanding of beauty in painting, the second one his views on marriage, and then you will have nothing left to ask."</t673>
<t674>"Elinoç," Marianne shouted, "is this fair?</t674> <t675>Is this elegant?</t675> <t676>Am I that narrow-minded?</t676> <t677>I understand your intention.</t677> <t678>I behaved too comfortably, too happily, too sincerely; I breached all the rules of etiquette; while I should have been distant, soulless, cold, and hypocritical, I acted openly and honestly: -if I had only talked about the weather and the roads, if I had only spoken once every ten minutes, I wouldn't have heard this rebuke."-</t678>
<t679>"My dear," said her mother, "You shouldn't be upset with Elinor - she was only joking.</t679> <t680>If she wanted to prevent you from enjoying the conversation with our new friend, I would have scolded her myself.</t680> <t681>"-Marianne immediately softened.</t681>
<t682>On the other hand, Willoughby showed every sign of enjoying this friendship; he clearly wanted to advance the friendship.</t682> <t683>He came to them every day.</t683> <t684>At first, he had the excuse of inquiring about Marianne's health; but the encouragement he received from the increasingly warm reception made this excuse unnecessary long before it became impossible.</t684> <t685>Marianne was confined to the house for a few days; but no confinement has ever been less tedious.</t685> <t686>Willoughby was a young man with good qualities, a quick imagination, a cheerful spirit, and an open, affectionate manner.</t686> <t687>He was just the person to capture Marianne's heart, for with all these traits, he combined not only an attractive personality but also a natural fervor of spirit, which, stimulated and strengthened by Marianne's own example, brought him closer to Marianne's feelings than anything else.</t687>
<t688>Her presence increasingly became Marianne's most exceptional delight.</t688> <t689>They read, talked, and sang together; she had a serious musical talent; she read with all the sensitivity and passion that Edward unfortunately lacked.</t689>
<t690>In Mrs. Dashwood's opinion, he was as flawless as Marianne thought; Elinor, too, saw nothing to criticize in him except for his habit of excessively expressing what he thought in every situation, regardless of people and circumstances, which strongly resembled her sister and pleased her sister.</t690> <t691>Passing hasty judgments about other people and expressing them, sacrificing general politeness to not disrupt the enjoyment of the matter at hand, and easily disregarding rules and etiquette, no matter how much they defended it, exhibited a lack of prudence that Elinor could not approve of.</t691>
<t692>Marianne was beginning to realize that her despair and groundlessness in meeting a man who could fit her description of perfection at the age of sixteen and a half was unfounded and baseless.</t692> <t693>Willoughby, at that unfortunate hour and in every brighter period, was the only person she envisioned in her dreams, to whom she could become attached; his talent was as strong as his actions showed the sincerity of his wishes in this direction.</t693>
<t694>The mother, who sighed at the young man's wealth and wished they would marry, began to hope for the marriage, to wait for it, and secretly to congratulate herself for having gained two suitors like Edward and Willoughby, all within a week.</t694>
<t695>Elinor was now, for the first time, aware of Colonel Brandon's interest in Marianne, which had been quickly discovered by their friends.</t695> <t696>The attention and jokes of their friends were directed towards the more fortunate rival; the small mockeries to which the other had been subjected before any interest had arisen ceased when his feelings, as a natural consequence of his passion, truly began to appear ridiculous.</t696> <t697>Elinor now had to admit, albeit reluctantly, that the feelings Mrs. Jennings attributed to Colonel Brandon for her own amusement indeed stemmed from her sister, and that although a general similarity in temperament had stirred Mr. Willoughby's emotions, an equally striking difference in character would not pose an obstacle in Colonel Brandon's eyes.</t697> <t698>She saw this with concern; for what could a quiet man of thirty-five hope for against a lively man of twenty-five?</t698> <t699>Since she could not wish for his success, she wholeheartedly wished for his indifference.</t699> <t700>She liked him - despite his gravity, she found him interesting.</t700> <t701>His manners, though serious, were gentle; his seriousness seemed more a result of a tendency towards self-control than a natural gloominess.</t701> <t702>Sir John had hinted at the wounds and disappointments in his past, which justified her intuition that he was an unfortunate man; she thought of him with respect and pity.</t702>
<t703>Perhaps he felt even closer to her because he was underestimated by Willoughby and Marianne, who were prejudiced against her for not being lively and young, and who scoffed at her virtues.</t703>
<t704>"Brandon is such a man," said Willoughby one day, while they were talking about him, "everyone likes him but no one cares; everyone enjoys seeing him, but no one turns to talk to him."</t704>
<t705>"I think so too," Marianne exclaimed.</t705>
<t706>"Do not be proud of this, though," said Elinor, "because you are both being unfair.</t706> <t707>He is someone the whole family in the Park respects; personally, every time I see him, I am eager to chat with him.</t707><t708>"</t708>
<t709>"Being under your protection," replied Willoughby, "is obviously very good for her; but as for the respect of others, it is a complete insult.</t709> <t710>Who would submit to the disgrace of being admired by women like Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, while everyone else remains indifferent?"</t710>
<t711>"But perhaps the disdain of people like you and Marianne compensates for the respect of Lady Middleton and her mother.</t711> <t712>Their praise may be criticism, while your criticism might be praise, because they are no less thoughtless than you are prejudiced and cruel.</t712><t713>"</t713>
<t714>"You can even be sarcastic while defending your point of view."</t714><t715>"</t715>
<t716>"In your words, my favorite is a sensible man; and sense will always have many charms for me.</t716> <t717>Yes Marianne, even in a man of thirty or forty years old.</t717> <t718>He has seen much of the world, been abroad, has a mind that reads and thinks.</t718> <t719>I have found that he can provide me with a great deal of information on various subjects; he always answered my questions with polite and affectionate interest.</t719><t720>"</t720>
<t721>"So," Marianne exclaimed scornfully, "he said that the climate in the East Indies is hot and that mosquitoes are a nuisance.</t721><t722>"</t722>
<t723>"If I had asked such questions, he would undoubtedly have told me so, but these are topics that had already been explained to me before."</t723>
<t724>"Maybe," said Willoughby, "your observations extended to maharajas, gold rupees, and palanquins"</t724>
<t725>"I can say that his observations had gone further than your sincerity. Why don't you like him?"</t725><t726>"</t726>
<t727>"It's not that I dislike him.</t727> <t728>On the contrary, I think he is a highly respectable man whom everyone praises but no one pays attention to; he has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to fill, and two new coats every year.</t728><t729>"</t729>
<t730>"Moreover," cried Marianne, "he has neither intelligence, nor taste, nor spirit.</t730> <t731>There is not a single spark in his mind, a single intensity in his feelings, nor a single expression in his voice.</t731><t732>"</t732>
<t733>"You judge his faults so haphazardly and based on your own imagination," replied Elinor, "that any praises I could offer about him seem cold and feeble in comparison to your words.</t733> <t734>I can only say that he is a sensible, well-bred, knowledgeable, and kind man; I believe he has a loving heart.</t734><t735>"</t735>
<t736>"Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are being cruel to me now.</t736> <t737>You are trying to render me powerless with your words and convince me against my will.</t737> <t738>But it won't work.</t738> <t739>You will see that as skillful as you are, I am equally stubborn.</t739> <t740>I have three solid reasons for not liking Colonel Brandon: he frightened me with the prospect of rain when I wanted good weather; he found fault with the springs of my carriage, and I couldn't persuade him to buy my brown mare.</t740> <t741>However, if it will satisfy you to hear that I believe his character to be impeccable in other respects, I am ready to admit it.</t741> <t742>In return for such an admission, which will cause me some pain, you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever.</t742><t743>"</t743>
<t744>Neither Mrs. Dashwood nor her daughters had expected, when they first came to Devonshire, that they would have so many activities to occupy their time so quickly, receive so many invitations, and have constant visitors, to the extent that they now had very little free time for their serious affairs.</t744> <t745>But such was the case.</t745> <t746>When Marianne recovered, the entertainment plans that Sir John was organizing both at home and outside were put into action.</t746> <t747>Private balls began at the Park; lake parties were arranged whenever the October rains allowed.</t747> <t748>Willoughby attended all the gatherings; the atmosphere of ease and intimacy that naturally accompanied these parties was arranged in such a way that he could deepen his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, witness Marianne's superior qualities, display his passionate admiration for her, and receive clear signs from Marianne's behavior of her interest in him.</t748>
<t749>Elinor was not surprised by their closeness.</t749> <t750>She only wished it were not so conspicuous; once or twice she even considered advising Marianne to compose herself.</t750> <t751>But Marianne detested any kind of secrecy unless there was a real possibility of shame; to her, attempting to restrain feelings that were not inherently shameful seemed not only unnecessary but also like a disgraceful submission of her mind to vulgar and erroneous views.</t751> <t752>Willoughby shared the same opinion, and his behavior constantly reflected their shared beliefs.</t752>
<t753>When the young man was around, the girl saw no one else.</t753> <t754>Everything he did was right.</t754> <t755>Everything he said was clever.</t755> <t756>If the evenings in the park ended with a card game, the young man would cheat against himself and everyone at the table to ensure the girl got a good hand.</t756> <t757>If the night's entertainment was dancing, they would be partners every time; if they had to part for a few dances, they made sure to stay together and didn't speak a word to anyone else.</t757> <t758>These behaviors naturally made them the subject of ridicule; but being mocked neither embarrassed nor angered them.</t758>
<t759>Mrs. Dashwood approached their feelings with such warmth that it didn't seem possible to prevent this excessive display of emotion.</t759> <t760>To her, it was nothing more than the natural result of strong emotions in a young and lively spirit.</t760>
<t761>The season of happiness had come for Marianne.</t761> <t762>Her heart was devoted to Willoughby; the deep attachment she felt for Norland and had brought with her from Sussex seemed likely to lighten more quickly than she had thought possible, thanks to the charm the young man brought to Marianne's current home.</t762>
<t763>Elinor's happiness was not so great.</t763> <t764>She was not at ease; she did not derive pure joy from their entertainments.</t764> <t765>They could not provide her with a friend who could replace what she had left behind or teach her to think of Norland with less sorrow than before.</t765> <t766>Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could offer her the conversations she longed for; although Mrs. Jennings was an incessant talker and had shown her the courtesy of making her the recipient of a large part of her conversation from the very beginning.</t766> <t767>She had repeated her own life story to Elinor three or four times; if Elinor's memory were as strong as her ability to think, she could have learned all the details of Mr. Jennings' last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died at the very beginning of their acquaintance.</t767> <t768>Lady Middleton was more reasonable than her mother, simply because she was quieter.</t768> <t769>Elinor needed very little observation to realize that her measured demeanor was a calmness of behavior without any share of intellect.</t769> <t770>She was the same towards her husband and mother as she was towards them; thus, intimacy was neither to be sought nor expected.</t770> <t771>Let her say something one day that she didn't say the day before!</t771> <t772>Her dullness was constant, for even her mood was always the same; she did not object to the parties arranged by her husband, ensured that everything was conducted properly, and although her two eldest children accompanied her, she did not seem to derive more pleasure from them than from staying at home; -her own presence did not contribute much to the enjoyment of others, as she did not participate in their conversations, so much so that sometimes her presence among them was only remembered when she started complaining about her mischievous sons.</t772>
<t773>Among all the new acquaintances, Elinor found only Colonel Brandon to be someone who could command respect for his abilities, evoke an interest in friendship, or provide pleasure as a companion.</t773> <t774>Willoughby was out of the question.</t774> <t775>Elinor's approval and interest, even her sisterly concern, did not affect him; but he was a lover; all his attention was on Marianne, and even a much less charming man could seem more agreeable to those around.</t775> <t776>Colonel Brandon, unfortunately, was deprived of the courage to think of Marianne, and found his greatest solace in his sister's absolute indifference by conversing with Elinor.</t776>
<t777>Elinor's pity for him increased, as she had reason to guess what a torment it must be to have one's love disappointed.</t777> <t778>This guess was confirmed one evening in the Park when, while everyone else was dancing, a few words accidentally slipped from his mouth as they sat together by mutual consent.</t778> <t779>His eyes were fixed on Marianne; after a few minutes of silence, he said with a faint smile, "Your sister, I understand, does not look kindly on second attachments.</t779><t780>"</t780>
<t781>"Yes," replied Elinor, "every thought of his is so romantic.</t781><t782>"</t782>
<t783>"Or maybe he thinks it's impossible for them to exist.</t783><t784>"</t784>
<t785>"I'm sure it is.</t785> <t786>But I don't know how he manages it without considering the character of his own father, who has two wives.</t786> <t787>However, within a few years, his views will settle on a basis of reasonable common sense and observation; then it might be easier to describe and justify his views than it is now, at least for anyone other than himself.</t787><t788>"</t788>
<t789>"It will probably be so," replied Colonel Brandon; "yet there is something so charming in the prejudices of a young mind that one feels sorrow to see them sacrificed to the acceptance of more common views."</t789><t790>"</t790>
<t791>"I cannot agree with you on this matter," said Elinor.</t791> <t792>"There are troubles caused by feelings like Marianne's, and all the allurements and ignorance of the world cannot compensate for them.</t792> <t793>Marianne has an unfortunate tendency to disregard decorum; I hope that knowing the world better will be her greatest possible gain.</t793><t794>"</t794>
<t795>After a brief silence, Colonel Brandon continued speaking with these words-</t795>
<t796>"Does your sister make no distinction in her objection to a second friend?</t796> <t797>Or does she see it as the same offense for everyone?</t797> <t798>Should those who are disappointed by the infidelity of the other party or the unfavorable conditions in their initial choices remain indifferent for the rest of their lives?</t798><t799>"</t799>
<t800>"Honestly, I don't know his principles in every detail.</t800> <t801>The only thing I know is that I haven't yet heard him say that a second friendship can be excused.</t801><t802>"</t802>
<t803>"This," said Colonel Brandon, "cannot go on; feelings change, they change completely - No, no, do not wish for this, - when the romantic delicacies of a young mind have to be sacrificed, they are often replaced by very ordinary and very dangerous ideas!</t803> <t804>I speak from experience.</t804> <t805>I knew a lady whose temperament was very similar to your sister's, she thought like her, decided like her, but due to compulsory changes - a series of unfortunate events-" Here he suddenly stopped; he seemed to realize he had spoken too much and his expression led Elinor to thoughts that would not have otherwise come to her mind.</t805> <t806>The lady in question would probably have been mentioned in passing without suspicion, had Colonel Brandon not convinced Miss Dashwood that the things that upset that lady should not be mentioned.</t806> <t807>It was enough to lightly imagine combining Colonel Brandon's feelings with the tender memories of a past closeness.</t807> <t808>Elinor did not attempt more.</t808> <t809>But Marianne would not have stopped there.</t809> <t810>The whole story would have quickly written itself in her lively imagination and everything would have passed in the most sorrowful course of a painful love.</t810>
<t811>While Elinor and Marianne were taking a walk together the next morning, Marianne gave her sister a small piece of news; the news, despite Elinor already knowing Marianne's carelessness and thoughtlessness, surprised her as it was an extreme example of both.</t811> <t812>Marianne said with great pleasure that Willoughby had given her a horse, which he had personally raised on his estate in Somersetshire and was calculated to carry a lady perfectly.</t812> <t813>Without considering that her mother had no plans to keep a horse, that she would have to buy a horse for the servant even if she changed her mind because of this gift, hire a servant to ride the horse, and finally build a stable to house the horses, she had accepted the gift without hesitation and was telling her sister with great delight.</t813>
<t814>"He is thinking of sending his groom to Somersetshire for it immediately," he added, "when it arrives, we will ride it every day.</t814> <t815>You can use it too.</t815> <t816>Just imagine, dear Elinor, how delightful it would be to gallop on these slopes.</t816><t817>"</t817>
<t818>He did not want to wake up from such a dream of happiness, to accept the unpleasant realities of the matter, and for a while, he refused to think about them.</t818> <t819>A new servant was an insignificant expense; his mother would never object to it; any horse would do for the servant; he could always find a horse from the Park; as for the stable, even a simple shed would suffice.</t819> <t820>Elinor, upon this, from a man she had known for so little or at least for such a short time</t820>
<t821>He tried to question whether it was appropriate to accept such a gift.</t821> <t822>But this was too much.</t822>
<t823>"You are mistaken, Elinor," said Marianne warmly, "I do not know Willoughby any less.</t823> <t824>Of course, we haven't known each other for long, but after my mother and you, he is the person I know best in the world.</t824> <t825>It is not time or opportunity that determines intimacy; -it is only character.</t825> <t826>Sometimes seven years are not enough for some people to know each other, but for some, seven days are more than enough.</t826> <t827>If I accepted my brother's gift of a horse, I would consider myself guilty of a greater impropriety than accepting Willoughby's.</t827> <t828>Even though we have lived together for years, I know very little about John; but my opinion of Willoughby was formed a long time ago.</t828><t829>"</t829>
<t830>Elinor thought it would be wiser not to touch on this subject.</t830> <t831>She knew her sister's temperament.</t831> <t832>Objecting to such a sensitive topic would only lead her to cling more tightly to her own views.</t832> <t833>But when she appealed to her love for their mother, explaining the burdens that their selfless mother would have to bear if they accepted the house expansion (which she likely would), Marianne soon gave in; she promised not to provoke their mother into such a thoughtless act of kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell Willoughby at the first opportunity that they had to refuse the gift.</t833>
<t834>He also kept his word; when Willoughby visited the cottage, Elinor heard him say in a low voice that she was regretfully forced to decline accepting the gift on the same day.</t834> <t835>The reasons for this change were explained in such a way that it made it impossible for Willoughby to insist further.</t835> <t836>Nevertheless, Willoughby's sorrow was quite evident; after expressing this sincerely, he added in the same low voice, "But Marianne, even if you can't use it now, the horse is still yours.</t836> <t837>I will keep it for you until you can take it.</t837> <t838>When you leave Barton and establish your own household in a more permanent home, Queen Mab will be waiting for you.</t838><t839>"</t839>
<t840>Miss Dashwood heard all this; in the entirety of the sentence, in the young man's pronunciation of the words, in his addressing Marianne by her first name only, she immediately saw a very definite closeness, a very direct meaning indicating a perfect harmony between them.</t840> <t841>From that moment on, she did not doubt that they were engaged, and this belief did not cause any surprise except for the possibility that their situation might have been accidentally discovered by her or her friends, given the sincere nature of such individuals.</t841>
<t842>Margaret told her something the next day that showed her the situation in a clearer light.</t842> <t843>Willoughby had spent the previous evening with them; and when Margaret had the opportunity to be alone with Marianne and him in the parlor for a while, she made some observations which she later excitedly shared with her sister.</t843>
<t844>"Oh Elinor," she cried, "I have a secret to tell you about Marianne.</t844> <t845>I am sure she will marry Mr. Willoughby very soon.</t845><t846>"</t846>
<t847>"Since you first met on the High-church hillside, you have been saying the same thing almost every day; it had not even been a week since you met, and you were sure that Marianne was carrying his picture around her neck; but it turned out to be just a miniature of our great uncle.</t847><t848>"</t848>
<t849>"But really, this is something else.</t849> <t850>I'm sure they will get married very soon, because Willoughby is carrying a lock of her hair."</t850>
<t851>"Be careful, Margaret.</t851> <t852>It might be your great uncle's hair or something.</t852><t853>"</t853>
<t854>"But really Elinor, it was Marianne's hair.</t854> <t855>I'm sure of it because I saw the boy cutting her hair.</t855> <t856>Last night after tea, when you and mother left the room, they were whispering and talking quickly; the boy seemed to be begging her, then he took a pair of scissors and cut a long lock of her hair, because her hair was falling down her back; then he kissed the lock of hair, wrapped it in a piece of white paper, and put it in his pocketbook.</t856><t857>"</t857>
<t858>Elinor could not disbelieve such details told with such confidence; besides, she was not inclined to disbelieve, because the situation exactly matched what she had heard and seen herself.</t858>
<t859>Margaret's intelligence did not always manifest in a way that would please her sister so much.</t859> <t860>One evening at the Park, when Mrs. Jennings pressed her to reveal the name of the young man who was Elinor's favorite and whom she had been curious about for a long time, Margaret looked at her sister and said, "I'm not supposed to tell, am I, Elinor?"</t860><t861>"</t861>
<t862>This of course made everyone laugh; Elinor also tried to laugh.</t862> <t863>But it was a painful effort.</t863> <t864>She thought that Margaret's name was fixed on a certain person who could not carry it quietly; Mrs. Jennings would now keep mentioning him.</t864>
<t865>Marianne sincerely felt sorry for her sister; but she made things worse by scolding Margaret with a flushed face and an angry attitude.</t865>
<t866>"Remember that no matter what your guess is, you do not have the right to say it.</t866><t867>"</t867>
<t868>"I had no guess," Margaret replied; "you told me yourself.</t868><t869>"</t869>
<t870>This answer greatly increased everyone's cheerfulness; they pressed Margaret to say something more.</t870>
<t871>"Come on, please, Miss Margaret, tell us so we can know," said Mrs. Jennings.</t871> <t872>"What is the gentleman's name?</t872><t873>"</t873>
<t874>"I must not tell, madam.</t874> <t875>But I know who it is; I also know where they are.</t875><t876>"</t876>
<t877>"Yes yes, we can also guess where he is; of course, in his own house in Norland.</t877> <t878>He is probably the parson's apprentice.</t878><t879>"</t879>
<t880>"No, he is not the priest's apprentice.</t880> <t881>He has no profession.</t881><t882>"</t882>
<t883>"Margaret," said Marianne with great warmth, "all this is your invention, you know; there is no such person in real life."</t883><t884>"</t884>
<t885>"Then Marianne must have recently died, because I am sure there used to be such a man, and his name started with an F."</t885><t886>"</t886>
<t887>At that moment, Lady Middleton remarked, "It rained a lot today," and Elinor was grateful to her, knowing that the intervention was not so much a sensitivity shown to her but rather because Lady Middleton's husband and mother disliked such improper love affairs.</t887> <t888>Although she initiated the topic of rain, Colonel Brandon, who always paid attention to the feelings of others, immediately continued; both of them said quite a bit about the rain.</t888> <t889>Willoughby opened the piano and asked Marianne to sit at it; thus, among the various efforts of different people, the matter was closed and forgotten.</t889> <t890>However, Elinor could not easily escape the fear she had fallen into.</t890>
<t891>That evening, a group was formed to go see a very beautiful place, located about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to Colonel Brandon's brother-in-law who was abroad, and which could not be visited without Colonel Brandon according to his instructions.</t891> <t892>The land was said to be quite beautiful; Sir John, who praised the land enthusiastically, could be considered a reasonable judge, as he had been forming groups to visit the place at least twice every summer for the past ten years.</t892> <t893>There was a magnificent lake on the land; a sailing trip would provide the main part of the morning's entertainment; they would take cold food with them, only open carriages would be used, and everything would be conducted in the usual manner of people of taste.</t893>
<t894>When thinking about that time of the year, the trip seemed like a bold venture to some in the group; it had rained every day for the last fifteen days; -Elinor had already persuaded Mrs. Dashwood, who had a cold, to stay at home.</t894>
<t895>The travel plans to Whitwell turned out very differently than Elinor had hoped.</t895> <t896>While preparing to get wet, tired, and scared, the incident became even more unfortunate because they couldn't go at all.</t896>
<t897>At ten o'clock, the whole group had gathered in the Park for breakfast.</t897> <t898>Although it rained all night, the weather in the morning was quite nice; the clouds in the sky were dispersing, and the sun was coming out frequently.</t898> <t899>Everyone was in good spirits, everyone wanted to be happy, and rather than other possibilities, everyone was willing to endure the greatest troubles and difficulties.</t899>
<t900>While they were having breakfast, the letters were delivered.</t900> <t901>Among them, there was also a letter for Colonel Brandon; -he took the letter, glanced at it, his face changed color, and he immediately left the room.</t901>
<t902>"What's wrong with Brandon?" said Sir John.</t902>
<t903>Nobody knew.</t903>
<t904>"I hope he hasn't received bad news," said Lady Middleton.</t904> <t905>"For Colonel Brandon to be taken from my breakfast table so suddenly, it must be something unusual.</t905><t906>"</t906>
<t907>About five minutes later, Colonel Brandon returned.</t907>
<t908>"I hope the news is not bad, Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings as Colonel Brandon entered the room.</t908>
<t909>"Not at all, ma'am, thank you.</t909><t910>"</t910>
<t911>"Was it from Avignon?</t911> <t912>I hope it doesn't say that your sister's condition has worsened or anything.</t912><t913>"</t913>
<t914>"He doesn't say, ma'am.</t914> <t915>From the city; just a business letter.</t915><t916>"</t916>
<t917>"But if it's a business letter, how did it surprise you so much?</t917> <t918>Come on, come on, Colonel; tell the truth.</t918><t919>"</t919>
<t920>"Madam," said Lady Middleton, "mind your words."</t920><t921>"</t921>
<t922>"Maybe she was saying that your cousin Fanny got married, huh?" said Mrs. Jennings, ignoring her daughter's warning.</t922>
<t923>"No, believe me, he wasn't saying it.</t923><t924>"</t924>
<t925>"Well then, I know who it came from, Colonel.</t925> <t926>I hope the lady is well.</t926><t927>"</t927>
<t928>"Whom do you mean, madam?" said Colonel Brandon, blushing slightly.</t928>
<t929>"Ah, you know what I mean.</t929><t930>"</t930>
<t931>"I am truly sorry, madam," said Colonel Brandon, turning to Lady Middleton, "it is unfortunate that I received this letter today, as it concerns a matter that requires me to go to the city immediately.</t931><t932>"</t932>
<t933>"To the city!" cried Mrs. Jennings.</t933> <t934>"What business could you have in the city at this time of year?</t934><t935>"</t935>
<t936>"I am deeply saddened," continued Colonel Brandon, "that I have to leave such a pleasant group; but my main concern is that I fear my presence is necessary to ensure your entry into Whitwell.</t936><t937>"</t937>
<t938>What a heavy blow it was to all of them!</t938>
<t939>"But if you wrote a note to the steward, Mr. Brandon," said Marianne eagerly, "wouldn't that be enough?"</t939><t940>"</t940>
<t941>Colonel Brandon nodded his head.</t941>
<t942>"We need to go," said Sir John.</t942> <t943>"We can't cancel after preparing this much."</t943> <t944>"You can't go to the city until tomorrow, Brandon, that's it."</t944>
<t945>"I wish it were that easy.</t945> <t946>But postponing my trip even for a day is not in my hands!</t946><t947>"</t947>
<t948>"If we could learn what your job is," said Mrs. Jennings, "we'll see if it can be postponed.</t948><t949>"</t949>
<t950>"If you postpone your trip until we return," said Willoughby, "you won't be delayed by more than six hours.</t950><t951>"</t951>
<t952>"I can't afford to lose even an hour."</t952><t953>"-</t953>
<t954>Elinor heard Willoughby say to Marianne at that moment, "There are people who cannot stand a pleasant gathering.</t954> <t955>Brandon is one of them.</t955> <t956>He probably made up this excuse because he's afraid of catching a cold.</t956> <t957>I'll bet fifty guineas that he wrote the letter himself.</t957><t958>"</t958>
<t959>"I have no doubt," replied Marianne.</t959>
<t960>"There is no way to persuade you to change your mind, Brandon, I know," said Sir John, "once you make a decision.</t960> <t961>However, I hope you will think it over once more.</t961> <t962>Look, there are two Miss Careys from Newton, three Miss Dashwoods who have walked all the way from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby has risen two hours earlier than usual; the purpose is to go to Whitwell.</t962><t963>"</t963>
<t964>Colonel Brandon reiterated how sorry he was for disappointing everyone; but he also said that the matter was inevitable.</t964>
<t965>"Alright, when will you return?"</t965><t966>"</t966>
<t967>"I hope," added her ladyship, "that we can see you in Barton as soon as you leave the city; we will postpone the trip until you return.</t967><t968>"</t968>
<t969>"You are very kind.</t969> <t970>But the situation is so uncertain that I don't know when I can return; therefore, I dare not promise.</t970><t971>"</t971>
<t972>"Yo!"</t972> <t973>"He must return and he will return," shouted Sir John.</t973> <t974>"If he doesn't come by the weekend, I will go after him.</t974><t975>"</t975>
<t976>"Oh please go, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, "and then maybe you can find out what he is up to.</t976><t977>"</t977>
<t978>"I don't stick my nose into other people's business.</t978> <t979>Obviously, it's something they're ashamed of.</t979><t980>"</t980>
<t981>It was reported that Colonel Brandon's horses were ready.</t981>
<t982>"You're not going to the city on horseback, are you?" added Sir John.</t982>
<t983>"No.</t983> <t984>Only up to Honiton.</t984> <t985>From there, I'll go by car.</t985><t986>"</t986>
<t987>"Well, if you are determined, I wish you a good journey.</t987> <t988>But I wish you would change your mind.</t988><t989>"</t989>
<t990>"Believe me, it's not in my hands."</t990><t991>"</t991>
<t992>Then he/she said goodbye to the whole group.</t992>
<t993>"Do I not have the chance to see you and your sisters in the city this winter, Miss Dashwood?"</t993><t994>"</t994>
<t995>"I have no fear.</t995><t996>"</t996>
<t997>"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer period than I ever desired.</t997><t998>"</t998>
<t999>He greeted Marianne with just a nod and said nothing.</t999>
<t1000>"Come on, Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "tell us why you are going before you leave.</t1000><t1001>"</t1001>
<t1002>Colonel Brandon wished him a good day and left the room accompanied by Sir John.</t1002>
<t1003>The complaints and laments that had been restrained by politeness until that moment suddenly burst forth from everyone; they all repeatedly agreed on how nerve-wracking it was to be so disappointed.</t1003>
<t1004>"However," said Mrs. Jennings with a sense of triumph, "I can guess what his business is.</t1004><t1005>"</t1005>
<t1006>"Is that so, ma'am?" said almost everyone.</t1006>
<t1007>"Yes; I'm sure it concerns Miss Williams."</t1007><t1008>"</t1008>
<t1009>"Well, who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne.</t1009>
<t1010>"What! Don't you know who Miss Williams is?</t1010> <t1011>I'm sure you've heard of her before.</t1011> <t1012>A relative of the Colonel, dear; a very close relative.</t1012> <t1013>We won't say how close, for fear of shocking the young ladies."</t1013> <t1014>Then lowering her voice a bit, she said to Elinor, "His illegitimate daughter.</t1014><t1015>"</t1015>
<t1016>"Really!"</t1016><t1017>"</t1017>
<t1018>"Yes, indeed; he's the spitting image of him."</t1018> <t1019>"I guess the Colonel will leave all his fortune to him."</t1019><t1020>"</t1020>
<t1021>Lady Middleton's sense of grace was wounded; she took the trouble to personally say something about the weather to close such an inappropriate topic as the mention of an illegitimate girl.</t1021>
<t1022>When Sir John returned, he wholeheartedly joined in the general sorrow caused by such an unfortunate event; but he concluded his words by saying that since they were all together, they should do something to be happy; after some exchange of ideas, it was decided that although happiness could only be fully experienced at Whitwell, they could find a reasonable inner peace by taking a carriage ride in the countryside.</t1022> <t1023>Upon this, the carriages were ordered; the first to arrive was Willoughby's; Marianne looked happier than ever when she got into the carriage.</t1023> <t1024>Willoughby quickly passed through the park and soon they disappeared from sight; they were not seen again until they returned, and they returned later than everyone else.</t1024> <t1025>They both seemed to have enjoyed the trip, but while the others descended the slopes, they only said that they had followed the paths.</t1025>
<t1026>In the evening, it was decided to dance and for everyone to be extremely cheerful all day long.</t1026> <t1027>A few more people from the Careys came for dinner, and they enjoyed the privilege of almost twelve people sitting at the table; Sir John watched the table with great satisfaction.</t1027> <t1028>Willoughby took his usual place among the elder Miss Dashwoods.</t1028> <t1029>Mrs. Jennings sat to the right of Elinor; she hadn't been seated long when she leaned behind Willoughby and said to Marianne loudly enough for both to hear, "Despite all your tricks, I found you.</t1029> <t1030>I know where you were in the morning.</t1030><t1031>"</t1031>
<t1032>Marianne blushed and hastily replied, "Where?"</t1032>
<t1033>"Didn't you know," said Willoughby, "we had driven away in my car."</t1033><t1034>"</t1034>
<t1035>"Yes yes, Mr. Impostor, I know that very well, but I was determined to find out where you were going.</t1035> <t1036>-I hope you liked your house, Miss Marianne.</t1036> <t1037>I know it's a very big house; when I come to see you, I hope you will have redecorated it, because when I went there six years ago, it was in great need of it.</t1037><t1038>"</t1038>
<t1039>Marianne turned to the other side in a tremendous shock.</t1039> <t1040>Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; when Elinor made up her mind to find out where they had been, she learned that her own servant had questioned Mr. Willoughby's servant, and that they had gone to Allenham, spent quite some time walking in the garden, and exploring every part of the house.</t1040>
<t1041>Elinor couldn't believe this was true, because it was inconceivable that Willoughby would suggest entering the house while Mrs. Smith, with whom Marianne had not the slightest acquaintance, was inside, and that Marianne would agree.</t1041>
<t1042>When they left the dining room, Elinor asked her about these things and learned with great astonishment that everything Mrs. Jennings had recounted was completely true.</t1042> <t1043>Marianne was very angry with her for doubting this.</t1043>
<t1044>"Why do you think we haven't gone there, that we haven't seen the house, Elinor?</t1044> <t1045>Isn't this something you also often want to do?</t1045><t1046>"</t1046>
<t1047>"Yes Marianne, but I wouldn't go while Mrs. Smith was there and I had no other companion but Mr. Willoughby."</t1047><t1048>"</t1048>
<t1049>"But Mr. Willoughby is the only person entitled to show the house; and since we were going in an open carriage, it was impossible to have anyone else with us.</t1049> <t1050>I have never had a more enjoyable morning in my life.</t1050><t1051>"</t1051>
<t1052>"I am afraid," replied Elinor, "that the fact that an action is pleasant does not always prove it to be appropriate.</t1052><t1053>"</t1053>
<t1054>"On the contrary, Elinor, more than anything else, evidence proves it; because if there were really something inappropriate about what I did, I would notice it, because we always understand when we do something wrong, and I could never enjoy it with such a belief.</t1054><t1055>"</t1055>
<t1056>"But my dear Marianne, even though he subjected you to quite rude remarks, do you still not doubt the correctness of his behavior?</t1056><t1057>"</t1057>
<t1058>"If Mrs. Jennings' impudent words are to be evidence of improper behavior, then we are all guilty of crimes every moment of our lives.</t1058> <t1059>I do not value her advice or her criticisms.</t1059> <t1060>I do not think I did anything wrong by walking in Mrs. Smith's garden or touring her house.</t1060> <t1061>It will all belong to Willoughby one day and...</t1061> <t1062>"</t1062>
<t1063>"Even if it will belong to you one day, Marianne, you cannot justify your action."</t1063><t1064>"</t1064>
<t1065>Marianne blushed at this; but she was visibly pleased as well; after ten minutes of sincere contemplation, she returned to her sister and said with great cheerfulness, "I suppose it was not quite proper for me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby was very keen to show me the place; believe me, it is a very beautiful house.</t1065> <t1066>There is a delightful sitting room upstairs; its size is perfect for everyday use, and it would be wonderful with modern furniture.</t1066> <t1067>It's a corner room; it has windows on two sides.</t1067> <t1068>On one side, you look out over the bowling green at the back of the house to a magnificent, lush forest, and on the other side, you have a view of the church and village; beyond that, the rugged hills we have always admired.</t1068> <t1069>Admittedly, it didn't quite appeal to me, because nothing could be more tedious than that furniture - but if it were furnished properly - Willoughby says that with a few hundred pounds, it could become one of the most charming summer rooms in England.</t1069><t1070>"</t1070>
<t1071>If Elinor could listen to him without others intervening, she would describe every room in the house with the same pleasure.</t1071>
<t1072>Colonel Brandon's sudden end to his visit to the Park, combined with his determination to conceal the reason, filled Mrs. Jennings' mind and aroused her curiosity for two or three days; she was a great busybody, as everyone should be who takes a lively interest in the comings and goings of all their acquaintances.</t1072> <t1073>She constantly wondered what the reason could be; it was definitely bad news; then she reviewed every possible trouble that could have befallen him, with a resolve that left no room for chance.</t1073>
<t1074>"I'm sure it's a very distressing matter," she said.</t1074> <t1075>"I saw it on his face.</t1075> <t1076>Poor man!</t1076> <t1077>I'm afraid his situation might have worsened.</t1077> <t1078>The estate at Delaford didn't bring in more than two thousand a year; and his brother left everything in a terrible mess.</t1078> <t1079>I think he was called because of money matters, because what else could it be?</t1079> <t1080>I wonder if that's the case.</t1080> <t1081>I would give anything to know the truth.</t1081> <t1082>Maybe it has to do with Miss Williams - it must be, because he was very embarrassed when I mentioned her.</t1082> <t1083>Maybe she fell ill in the city; it's very possible, because I know she was already quite sickly.</t1083> <t1084>I'd bet anything, the matter is about Miss Williams.</t1084> <t1085>It's hardly possible that the Colonel is in financial trouble now, because he's a very prudent man, and he must have cleared the estate's debts by now.</t1085> <t1086>What could it be! Maybe his sister in Avignon has worsened and called for him.</t1086> <t1087>It's quite reasonable for him to leave in such a hurry.</t1087> <t1088>Well, I sincerely hope that his troubles end, and he finds a good wife as a reward.</t1088><t1089>"</t1089>
<t1090>Mrs. Jennings wondered in this way, spoke in this way, her opinion changed with every new possibility that came to her mind, and every possibility seemed equally likely.</t1090> <t1091>Elinor, who sincerely wished well for Colonel Brandon, did not feel as curious as Mrs. Jennings about his sudden departure; in addition to thinking that the matter did not require such great astonishment or the pursuit of various possibilities, her curiosity was mainly drawn to something else.</t1091> <t1092>What piqued her curiosity was the unusual silence of her sister and Willoughby on the matter that everyone was eagerly awaiting to hear about.</t1092> <t1093>As this silence continued, the situation seemed more contradictory and stranger to their temperaments with each passing day.</t1093> <t1094>Elinor could not understand why, judging by their daily behavior towards each other, they did not openly tell her and their mother what was said to have happened.</t1094>
<t1095>She could easily understand that they could not immediately proceed to marriage; although Willoughby was independent, there was no reason to believe he was wealthy.</t1095> <t1096>Sir John estimated that his estate brought in six or seven hundred a year; but he led such an extravagant life that this income could hardly cover, and he often complained about his poverty.</t1096> <t1097>But Elinor could not understand the strange secrecy they maintained about their engagement, which actually concealed nothing; it was so contrary to their general views and actions that Elinor sometimes doubted they were truly engaged, and this doubt prevented her from asking Marianne about the matter.</t1097>
<t1098>Nothing could give more insight into their closeness than Willoughby's behavior.</t1098> <t1099>He showed Marianne the most privileged affection that a lover's heart could give and treated the rest of the family with the warm interest of a son and brother.</t1099> <t1100>He seemed to have made the cottage his home and loved it; he spent most of his time there instead of at Allenham; if everyone wasn't gathered at the Park, it was almost certain that his morning exercise would end there, and he would spend the rest of the day with Marianne, with his favorite pointer at Marianne's feet.</t1100>
<t1101>The whole evening, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the village, his heart seemed unusually open to a sense of closeness to the objects around him; upon Mrs. Dashwood's mention of her plan to expand the cottage in the spring, he fervently objected to any changes being made to a place that love had made perfect for him.</t1101>
<t1102>"No!" he shouted, "Expand this beautiful cabin?</t1102> <t1103>No.</t1103> <t1104>I will never agree to that.</t1104> <t1105>If my feelings are considered, not a single stone should be added, not a single inch should be enlarged.</t1105><t1106>"</t1106>
<t1107>"Don't worry," said Miss Dashwood, "such a thing will never happen, because my mother will never have that much money."</t1107><t1108>"</t1108>
<t1109>"I was overjoyed with all my heart," he exclaimed.</t1109> <t1110>"If he's not going to spend his money on other things, let him remain poor forever.</t1110><t1111>"</t1111>
<t1112>"Thank you, Willoughby.</t1112> <t1113>You can be sure that I will never sacrifice the sense of attachment of you or anyone I love to any modification in the world.</t1113> <t1114>When I see my accounts in the spring, whatever amount remains, I would rather it lie idle than engage in something that would upset you.</t1114> <t1115>But do you love this place so much that you don't see its flaws?</t1115><t1116>"</t1116>
<t1117>"Yes," said Willoughby.</t1117> <t1118>"It's perfect for me."</t1118> <t1119>"Moreover, I see this place as the only one where happiness is possible; if I were rich enough, I would immediately demolish Combe and build an exact replica of this cottage in its place."</t1119><t1120>"</t1120>
<t1121>"With its dark, narrow staircase and smoke-filled kitchen, probably," said Elinor.</t1121>
<t1122>"Yes," cried Willoughby in the same eager voice, "with everything that belongs to it; -every comfort, every discomfort exactly in place.</t1122> <t1123>Then, only then, under such a roof, could I be as happy at Combe as I am at Barton.</t1123><t1124>"</t1124>
<t1125>"Even under the disadvantage of better rooms, a wider staircase," said Elinor, "I am proud that you will find your own home as perfect as this one from now on.</t1125><t1126>"</t1126>
<t1127>"Of course," said Willoughby, "there are certain circumstances that make that place very precious to me; but this place holds a significance in my heart that no other place can share.</t1127><t1128>"</t1128>
<t1129>Mrs. Dashwood looked at Marianne with delight; Marianne's beautiful eyes were so intently fixed on Willoughby that it clearly showed how well she understood him.</t1129>
<t1130>"How much I have wished," added Willoughby, "that those living in Barton Cottage would be at Allenham this year!</t1130> <t1131>There hasn't been a time when I passed by it without admiring its location and lamenting that no one was living there.</t1131> <t1132>Then, I never expected that the first news I would hear from Mrs. Smith upon my next visit to the village would be that Barton Cottage had been taken: the event delighted and interested me so suddenly that I feel like saying the happiness I would experience there was already known to me.</t1132> <t1133>Don't you think so too, Marianne?" He said this to Marianne in a low voice.</t1133> <t1134>Then, continuing in his previous tone, he said, "Are you going to get up and ruin this house again, Mrs. Dashwood? Making fanciful renovations and depriving the house of its simplicity!</t1134> <t1135>You will turn this beautiful room, where our acquaintance first began and where we have spent many happy hours together since then, into an ordinary hall, and people will quickly pass through this room that has so far provided a more genuine shelter and comfort than the world's largest apartment could offer.</t1135><t1136>"</t1136>
<t1137>Mrs. Dashwood reassured her that she would not undertake any alterations.</t1137>
<t1138>"You are a good woman," replied Willoughby.</t1138> <t1139>"Your words have eased my mind.</t1139> <t1140>Take your words a step further and make me happy.</t1140> <t1141>Tell me not only that your home will remain the same, but also that I will always find you and your family just as I left you, and that you will always welcome me with the kindness that makes everything belonging to you so precious to me.</t1141><t1142>"</t1142>
<t1143>The word was given immediately and throughout the evening, Willoughby's behavior reflected his love and happiness.</t1143>
<t1144>"Will we see you at dinner tomorrow evening?" said Mrs. Dashwood, as Willoughby was leaving them.</t1144> <t1145>"I am not requesting you to come in the morning, because we will be walking to the Park to visit Lady Middleton.</t1145><t1146>"</t1146>
<t1147>Willoughby promised to join them around four o'clock.</t1147>
<t1148>Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day; two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne, citing a fictitious engagement, asked to be excused from the group; her mother, concluding that she had arranged for Willoughby to visit while they were away the previous night, was more than happy for her to stay home.</t1148>
<t1149>Upon their return from the park, they found Willoughby's carriage with his servant waiting at the cottage; Mrs. Dashwood realized she was right in her thoughts.</t1149> <t1150>So far, everything had gone as she had predicted; but upon entering the house, she encountered a situation that no foresight had told her to expect.</t1150> <t1151>They were still in the hallway when Marianne, in a state of severe distress, hurriedly exited the sitting room; her handkerchief was at her eyes, and without paying them any attention, she rushed upstairs.</t1151> <t1152>Surprised and alarmed, they went directly into the room she had come out of and found only Willoughby there; his back was turned to them, leaning against the fireplace.</t1152> <t1153>When they entered, he turned to face them; his expression strongly indicated that he shared the emotion that had overwhelmed Marianne.</t1153>
<t1154>"Is something wrong with Marianne?" cried Mrs. Dashwood, entering the room, "is she ill?</t1154><t1155>"</t1155>
<t1156>"I hope not," replied Willoughby, trying to appear cheerful; and with a forced smile, he immediately added, "I should be the one who is ill - because I am currently suffering from a tremendous disappointment!</t1156><t1157>"</t1157>
<t1158>"Disappointment!</t1158><t1159>"-</t1159>
<t1160>"Yes, because I cannot keep the promise I made to you.</t1160> <t1161>Mrs. Smith used her wealth to exert power over a poor cousin dependent on her by sending me to London for work this morning.</t1161> <t1162>I have just received my orders and bid farewell to Allenham; now I have come to bid you farewell under the pretense of cheering up.</t1162><t1163>"</t1163>
<t1164>"To London? -are you going this morning?"</t1164><t1165>"</t1165>
<t1166>"Right now."</t1166><t1167>"</t1167>
<t1168>"This is a great misfortune.</t1168> <t1169>But Mrs. Smith's word should be heeded; -I hope business doesn't keep you away from us for long.</t1169><t1170>"</t1170>
<t1171>Willoughby blushed as he answered.</t1171> <t1172>"You are very kind, but I don't think I will return to Devonshire immediately.</t1172> <t1173>My visits to Mrs. Smith will not be renewed within a year.</t1173><t1174>"</t1174>
<t1175>"Mrs. Smith is not your only friend, is she?</t1175> <t1176>Is Allenham the only place you will be invited around here?</t1176> <t1177>Shame on you, Willoughby.</t1177> <t1178>Are you going to wait for an invitation from us?</t1178><t1179>"</t1179>
<t1180>Willoughby blushed even more; with his eyes fixed on the ground, he could only give this reply, "You are very kind."</t1180><t1181>"</t1181>
<t1182>Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor in astonishment.</t1182> <t1183>Elinor was equally astonished.</t1183> <t1184>Everyone remained silent for a few seconds.</t1184> <t1185>Then Mrs. Dashwood spoke.</t1185>
<t1186>"All I can say, dear Willoughby, is that you will always be warmly welcomed at Barton Cottage; I will not insist on your immediate return here because only you can decide how Mrs. Smith will react to it; in that regard, I will neither question your decision nor doubt your desire."</t1186><t1187>"</t1187>
<t1188>"My current words," replied Willoughby in a confused state, "are such that - I do not deem myself worthy enough -"</t1188>
<t1189>He stopped.</t1189> <t1190>Mrs. Dashwood was too astonished to speak; another silence followed.</t1190> <t1191>Willoughby broke the silence; with a slight smile, "It is absurd to prolong this.</t1191> <t1192>I will not torture myself further by staying among friends whose presence I cannot currently enjoy," he said.</t1192>
<t1193>Then, he hurriedly said goodbye and left the room.</t1193> <t1194>They saw him get into his car; the car disappeared from sight in an instant.</t1194>
<t1195>Mrs. Dashwood was too overwhelmed to speak, and she immediately left the sitting room to be alone with the sorrow and fear caused by this sudden departure.</t1195>
<t1196>Elinor was at least as uneasy as her mother.</t1196> <t1197>She thought about what had happened with anxiety and regret.</t1197> <t1198>Willoughby's behavior when he bid them farewell, his discomfort, his efforts to appear cheerful, and most of all his reluctance to accept her mother's invitation, his cowardice unbecoming of a lover, unbecoming of him, made her extremely uneasy.</t1198> <t1199>For a moment, she feared that Willoughby had made no serious plans, then that an unfortunate quarrel had occurred between him and her sister; - Marianne's distress when she left the room was the kind that could result from a serious quarrel, but considering Marianne's love for him, any quarrel seemed almost impossible.</t1199>
<t1200>But regardless of the details of their separation, her sister's sorrow was evident; she thought with deep compassion of Marianne's terrible grief, which she not only allowed to linger but also nurtured and cultivated as if it were a duty.</t1200>
<t1201>About half an hour later, his mother returned; although her eyes were red, she was not entirely cheerless.</t1201>
<t1202>"Our dear Willoughby is now quite far from Barton, Elinor," she said, as she sat down to her work, "who knows how sorrowful he must be going."</t1202><t1203>"</t1203>
<t1204>"All of this is very strange.</t1204> <t1205>Leaving so suddenly!</t1205> <t1206>It seems like a spur-of-the-moment decision.</t1206> <t1207>Last night, he was very happy with us, very cheerful, very emotional.</t1207> <t1208>But now, to leave after giving notice just ten minutes ago - and not coming back!</t1208> <t1209>-There must have been something he couldn't tell us.</t1209> <t1210>His speech, his behavior were not as usual.</t1210> <t1211>You must have noticed the difference as much as I did.</t1211> <t1212>What could it be?</t1212> <t1213>Could they have had a fight?</t1213> <t1214>Why else would he reject your invitation?" -</t1214>
<t1215>"The missing thing was not the desire, Elinor; I can see that clearly.</t1215> <t1216>She did not have the strength to accept it.</t1216> <t1217>I have thought it over thoroughly and found the explanation for everything that seemed strange to both you and me at first.</t1217><t1218>"</t1218>
<t1219>"Is that so?</t1219><t1220>"</t1220>
<t1221>"Yes.</t1221> <t1222>I have explained these to myself in a satisfactory manner; -but you, Elinor, you who love to doubt everything at every opportunity, I know, you will not find this satisfactory; but you won't be able to change my mind by talking.</t1222> <t1223>My opinion is that Mrs. Smith suspects that the young man is interested in Marianne and does not approve of it; (maybe she has other plans for the young man) and therefore wants to keep him away; -the task she sent him on is just a pretext to get rid of him.</t1223> <t1224>I think that's how it happened.</t1224> <t1225>Also, the young man is aware that she does not approve of the relationship, so he has not yet dared to confess that he is engaged to Marianne; since he relies on the woman, he feels compelled to comply with her plans and stays away from Devonshire for a while.</t1225> <t1226>I know, you will say to me that these things might have happened or might not have happened, but unless you find another way to explain the matter as satisfactorily as this, I will not listen to objections.</t1226> <t1227>Now, what will you say to these?</t1227><t1228>"</t1228>
<t1229>"Nothing, because you guessed my answer.</t1229><t1230>"</t1230>
<t1231>"So you would say it might have happened, or it might not have happened.</t1231> <t1232>Ah Elinor, your feelings are so incomprehensible!</t1232> <t1233>Your mind always interprets everything in the worst way.</t1233> <t1234>You attribute misery to Marianne and guilt to Willoughby, whereas you should find excuses for Willoughby.</t1234> <t1235>You are determined to see him as guilty just because he bid us farewell in a colder manner than usual.</t1235> <t1236>Will you not allow for any helplessness, or a state of mind shaken by a fresh disappointment?</t1236> <t1237>Will no possibility be accepted just because it is not certain?</t1237> <t1238>Will we not give any credit to a man for whom there are so many reasons to love, but no reason to think ill of?</t1238> <t1239>To the possibility of inexplicable impulses that must remain hidden for a while?</t1239> <t1240>Alright then, what do you doubt about him?</t1240><t1241>"</t1241>
<t1242>"I don't really know this either.</t1242> <t1243>-But suspecting something unpleasant is the inevitable result of such a change we just witnessed in him.</t1243> <t1244>On the other hand, you are very right in saying that we should give credit to his good sides; I want to be sincere in my judgments about everyone.</t1244> <t1245>Willoughby may undoubtedly have very valid reasons for his behavior, and I hope he does.</t1245> <t1246>But it would have been more fitting for Willoughby to say them immediately.</t1246> <t1247>Secrecy may be necessary; but I still can't accept his practice of secrecy.</t1247><t1248>"</t1248>
<t1249>"Still, do not blame him for deviating from his character when he is forced to change.</t1249> <t1250>But do you truly accept the truth of what I said to defend him?</t1250> <t1251>-I am glad he has been exonerated.</t1251><t1252>"</t1252>
<t1253>"Not exactly.</t1253> <t1254>It might be appropriate to hide their engagement (if they are indeed engaged) from Mrs. Smith - if that's the case, it would be wise for Willoughby not to be seen much in Devonshire at the moment.</t1254> <t1255>But that is no excuse for hiding it from us.</t1255><t1256>"</t1256>
<t1257>"Hiding something from us!</t1257> <t1258>My dear, are you accusing Willoughby and Marianne of hiding something?</t1258> <t1259>This is really very strange, because your eyes were reproaching them every day for their imprudent behavior.</t1259><t1260>"</t1260>
<t1261>"It's not their love," said Marianne, "I want proof of their engagement.</t1261><t1262>"</t1262>
<t1263>"I am quite satisfied with both matters."</t1263><t1264>"</t1264>
<t1265>"But neither of them said a single word to you about the matter."</t1265><t1266>"</t1266>
<t1267>"In a place where actions speak so clearly, I have no need for any words.</t1267> <t1268>His behavior towards Marianne and all of us, at least for the last fifteen days, has shown that he loves her and considers her his future wife, and that he harbors the closest familial feelings towards us, hasn't it?</t1268> <t1269>Haven't we understood each other perfectly well?</t1269> <t1270>His glances, his demeanor, his considerate and affectionate respect day by day asked for my consent, didn't they?</t1270> <t1271>Elinor dear, is it possible to doubt their engagement?</t1271> <t1272>How could such a thought even cross your mind?</t1272> <t1273>After being certain of your sister's love, could it be conceivable that Willoughby would abandon her or leave her for even a few months without expressing his love; -or even part without assuring each other of their trust?</t1273><t1274>"</t1274>
<t1275>"I must admit," replied Elinor, "that everything about them indicates they are engaged, except for one thing: their absolute silence on the matter, which weighs more heavily for me than anything else."</t1275><t1276></t1276>
<t1277>"This is very strange!</t1277> <t1278>I mean, after everything that has clearly happened between them, if you can doubt the nature of their closeness, you must think that Willoughby is a scoundrel.</t1278> <t1279>Has he been deceiving your sister all this time?</t1279> <t1280>Do you think he is actually indifferent to her?</t1280><t1281>"</t1281>
<t1282>"No, I can't think of that."</t1282> <t1283>"He must love her, and I'm sure he does."</t1283>
<t1284>"But if he can abandon Marianne with such indifference, with such disregard for the future, there must be something strange about his love, you say.</t1284><t1285>"</t1285>
<t1286>"You must remember, my dear mother, that I never saw this matter as certain.</t1286> <t1287>I admit, I had doubts; but they were weaker than before, and soon they might disappear completely.</t1287> <t1288>If we learn that they are corresponding, all my fears will vanish.</t1288><t1289>"</t1289>
<t1290>"A tremendous confession indeed!</t1290> <t1291>You only believe they will marry if you see them at the altar.</t1291> <t1292>Cruel girl! But I don't need such proof.</t1292> <t1293>In my opinion, nothing justified suspicion; there was no secrecy; everything was open and sincere from start to finish.</t1293> <t1294>You cannot doubt your sister's intentions.</t1294> <t1295>Therefore, you must be doubting Willoughby.</t1295> <t1296>But why?</t1296> <t1297>Is he not an honorable, sensitive man?</t1297> <t1298>Has he shown any inconsistency that would cause concern?</t1298> <t1299>Could he be a liar?</t1299><t1300>"</t1300>
<t1301>"I hope not, I don't think so," cried Elinor.</t1301> <t1302>"I love Willoughby, I sincerely love him; doubting his honesty cannot hurt you more than it hurts me.</t1302> <t1303>It happens spontaneously, I don't do it knowingly.</t1303> <t1304>I admit I was astonished by the change in his behavior this morning; -he was speaking like a different person and showed no sign of gratitude in the face of your kindness.</t1304> <t1305>But all of this can be explained by his affairs being in the situation you guessed.</t1305> <t1306>He had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave with great sorrow; perhaps he had to resist the desire to return here soon out of fear of offending Mrs. Smith, but if he dared to act like an unfaithful, suspicious part of our family by rejecting your invitation and saying he was leaving for a long time, he could very well feel discomfort from it.</t1306> <t1307>In such a situation, it would have been more honorable, and more in line with his character, to openly express his difficulties; -but I am not going to object to anyone's behavior with such an intolerant thought, just because it differs from my judgments or does not seem right and consistent to me.</t1307><t1308>"</t1308>
<t1309>"You spoke very well.</t1309> <t1310>Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected.</t1310> <t1311>Although we have not known him for a long time, he is not a stranger to these parts; has anyone spoken a word against him?</t1311> <t1312>If he were in a position to act independently and marry immediately, it would be strange for him to leave us without explaining everything to me: but that is not the case.</t1312> <t1313>This is an engagement that started under some impossibilities; because their marriage may only be possible in a very uncertain future; even as far as can be observed, secrecy is still quite appropriate."</t1313>
<t1314>They fell silent with Margaret's entrance; then Elinor had the opportunity to think over her mother's speculations, to accept that many of them were possible, and to hope that all of them would be justified.</t1314>
<t1315>They did not see Marianne until dinner; then she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word.</t1315> <t1316>Her eyes were red and swollen; even at that moment, she seemed to be struggling to hold back her tears.</t1316> <t1317>She avoided everyone's gaze, could neither eat nor speak, and after a while, upon her mother gently pressing her hand, her last bit of resistance crumbled and she burst into tears and left the room.</t1317>
<t1318>The whole evening passed in deep sorrow.</t1318> <t1319>She had no strength left at all, because she did not feel the desire to control herself.</t1319> <t1320>Even the slightest hint of anything related to Willoughby overwhelmed her instantly; although her family acted with great sensitivity to comfort her, it was not possible for them to avoid every topic that would remind her of Willoughby when they spoke.</t1320>
<t1321>Marianne would have considered herself unforgivable if she had been able to sleep even for a moment on the first night after parting from Willoughby.</t1321> <t1322>She would have been ashamed to face her family the next morning if she had not gotten out of bed with a greater need for sleep than when she lay down.</t1322> <t1323>But the feelings that made such determination a disgrace did not leave her in danger of experiencing it.</t1323> <t1324>She was awake all night and cried for most of it.</t1324> <t1325>She woke up with a headache, had no strength to speak, did not want to eat anything; she caused her mother and sisters pain at every moment, rejecting their attempts to console her.</t1325> <t1326>Her sense was very strong!</t1326>
<t1327>When breakfast was over, she went outside on her own and wandered around the vicinity of Allenham village throughout the morning, delving into her past happiness and weeping for today's devastation.</t1327>
<t1328>The evening also passed with the same intensity of emotion.</t1328> <t1329>She played every song she had played for Willoughby, every folk song where their voices most frequently merged, and sat at the piano with her eyes fixed on the music lines Willoughby had written for her, until her heart grew so heavy that it could no longer bear the sorrow; this food of torment was taken every day.</t1329> <t1330>She spent long hours at the piano, sometimes singing, sometimes crying; her voice was often completely silenced by her tears.</t1330> <t1331>As in music, she sought the easily created torment of the contrast between the past and the present in books.</t1331> <t1332>She read nothing except what they had read together.</t1332>
<t1333>Such intense sorrow could not, of course, be sustained forever; within a few days, it transformed into a calmer melancholy; but these daily activities he undertook anew, solitary walks, and silent reflections still occasionally produced torrents of sorrow as vivid as ever.</t1333>
<t1334>No letter came from Willoughby; besides, Marianne did not seem to be expecting one.</t1334> <t1335>Her mother was surprised, Elinor was disturbed again.</t1335> <t1336>But Mrs. Dashwood seemed to always find an explanation that at least satisfied herself whenever she wanted.</t1336>
<t1337>"Don't forget Elinor," he said, "how often Sir John carries our letters to and from the post.</t1337> <t1338>We have already accepted that secrecy might be necessary; if the letters are to pass through Sir John's hands, we must know that secrecy cannot be maintained.</t1338><t1339>"</t1339>
<t1340>Elinor could not deny the truth of this and tried to see it as a sufficient reason for their silence.</t1340> <t1341>But there was such a direct, simple method, so suitable for knowing the real state of the matter and immediately removing all mystery, that she couldn't help but mention it to her mother.</t1341>
<t1342>"Why don't you ask Marianne right away," he said, "whether she is engaged to Willoughby or not?</t1342> <t1343>If this question comes from you, her mother, such a loving, such a concerned mother, it cannot offend her.</t1343> <t1344>It would be a natural result of the love you show her.</t1344> <t1345>There used to be no secrets, especially not from you.</t1345><t1346>"</t1346>
<t1347>"I would never ask such a question in the world.</t1347> <t1348>Just think, if they are not even engaged, how upset they would be!</t1348> <t1349>It would be a great cruelty.</t1349> <t1350>After forcing her to make a confession that should still be hidden from everyone, I could never again be worthy of her trust.</t1350> <t1351>I know Marianne's heart: I know that she loves me very much, and that when circumstances allow it to be revealed, I will not be the last person to be told about the matter.</t1351> <t1352>I would never try to force anyone to reveal their secret; especially not a child; because a sense of duty might prevent them from denying it even if they wanted to.</t1352><t1353>"</t1353>
<t1354>When Elinor considered her sister's youth, she found this generosity excessive and insisted, but it was to no avail; common sense, logic, prudence, all were defeated by Mrs. Dashwood's romantic sensibility.</t1354>
<t1355>A few days passed before Willoughby's name was mentioned by one of the family members in Marianne's presence; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, however, were not so kind; their pointed remarks added new pains to the painful hours; -but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood picked up a volume of Shakespeare and said,</t1355>
<t1356>"We haven't finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby left before he could finish it.</t1356> <t1357>Let's skip it and when he returns...</t1357> <t1358>But surely it will be months before he comes back.</t1358><t1359>"</t1359>
<t1360>"Months!" Marianne exclaimed with strong astonishment.</t1360> <t1361>"No - not even weeks.</t1361><t1362>"</t1362>
<t1363>Mrs. Dashwood was saddened by what was said; but Elinor was pleased because it had elicited a response from Marianne that expressed her confidence in Willoughby and her knowledge of Willoughby's intentions.</t1363>
<t1364>One morning, about a week after Willoughby left the village, Marianne was persuaded to join her sisters on their daily walks instead of wandering alone.</t1364> <t1365>Until then, she had carefully avoided any kind of companionship during her outings.</t1365> <t1366>If her sisters wanted to walk on the hillside, she would head straight for the paths; if they talked about the valley, she would quickly climb the hill, and she would not be around when they set out.</t1366> <t1367>But finally, she was persuaded by Elinor's efforts, who did not approve of such constant avoidance.</t1367> <t1368>They walked along the valley, spoke little, as Marianne's mind was not with them; Elinor, pleased with the progress, did not strive for more at that moment.</t1368> <t1369>Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the terrain, though still rich, was less wild and more open, the road they had taken when they first arrived in Barton lay ahead of them; when they reached that point, they stopped and looked around, examining the view that formed the horizon of their cottage from a spot they had never reached on their previous walks.</t1369>
<t1370>They soon discovered something alive among the objects on the stage; it was a rider coming towards them.</t1370> <t1371>Within a few minutes, they could discern that it was a gentleman, and a moment later, Marianne cried out in a fit of ecstasy,</t1371>
<t1372>"It's him; really him; -I know it's him!" And just as she was about to rush to meet him, Elinor intervened,</t1372>
<t1373>"I think you're mistaken, Marianne.</t1373> <t1374>This is not Willoughby.</t1374> <t1375>He is not as tall as him, nor does he have his demeanor.</t1375><t1376>"</t1376>
<t1377>"There is, there is," cried Marianne, "there definitely is.</t1377> <t1378>His demeanor, his coat, his horse.</t1378> <t1379>I knew he would come soon.</t1379><t1380>"</t1380>
<t1381>He walked excitedly while talking; Elinor, almost certain that the person approaching was not Willoughby, quickened her steps to catch up with Marianne to prevent her from standing out.</t1381> <t1382>Soon, they were within thirty steps of the gentleman.</t1382> <t1383>Marianne looked again; her heart sank; just as she was about to turn sharply and run back, her sisters' voices rose to stop her, and a third voice, almost as familiar as Willoughby's, joined in asking her to stop; Marianne turned around in surprise and saw Edward Ferrars with joy.</t1383>
<t1384>At that moment, she was the only person in the world who could be excused for not having Willoughby; the only person who could receive a smile from him; she wiped away her tears to smile at him and, for a moment, forgot her own disappointment in her sister's happiness.</t1384>
<t1385>Edward got off his horse, gave it to his servant, and walked with them to Barton; he was already coming to visit them there.</t1385>
<t1386>Everyone welcomed him with great courtesy; especially Marianne showed even greater warmth than Elinor herself when welcoming him.</t1386> <t1387>For Marianne, the encounter between Edward and her sister was nothing but the continuation of the inexplicable coldness she often observed in their behavior towards each other at Norland.</t1387> <t1388>Moreover, on Edward's part, everything that a lover should seek and say in such a situation was missing.</t1388> <t1389>His mind was confused, he did not seem to take pleasure in seeing them, he did not appear cheerful or joyful, he said very little except for what was forced out of him by questions, and there was no sign of any affectionate difference in his behavior towards Elinor.</t1389> <t1390>Marianne watched and listened with increasing astonishment.</t1390> <t1391>She almost began to grow cold towards Edward; finally, following the usual course of her feelings, her mind went back to Willoughby; Willoughby's behavior formed a striking contrast to the behavior of her potential brother-in-law.</t1391>
<t1392>After a brief silence following the initial surprise and questions of the encounter, Marianne asked Edward if he had come directly from London.</t1392> <t1393>No, he had been in Devonshire for fifteen days.</t1393>
<t1394>"Fifteen days!" repeated Marianne, surprised that she had been in the same county as Elinor for so long without seeing her earlier.</t1394>
<t1395>Edward looked bored as he added that he was staying with a few friends in Plymouth.</t1395>
<t1396>"Have you been in Sussex recently?" said Eli-</t1396>
<t1397>north.</t1397>
<t1398>"I was at Norland about a month ago.</t1398><t1399>"</t1399>
<t1400>"So, how is beautiful Norland doing?" exclaimed Marianne.</t1400>
<t1401>"My beautiful Norland," said Elinor, "is probably in the same state as it usually is at this time of year.</t1401> <t1402>The woods and paths are covered with dead leaves.</t1402><t1403>"</t1403>
<t1404>"Ah!" cried Marianne, "how I used to watch their falls with dizzying emotions!</t1404> <t1405>How enchanted I was as they fluttered around me while walking with the wind!</t1405> <t1406>What dreams those leaves, the season, the air inspire, hand in hand!</t1406> <t1407>Now there is no one to see them.</t1407> <t1408>They only see trouble in them, hastily sweeping them away, removing them from sight as much as possible.</t1408><t1409>"</t1409>
<t1410>"Not everyone," said Elinor, "shares your passion for dead leaves."</t1410><t1411>"</t1411>
<t1412>"No; there aren't many who share my feelings, nor many who understand them.</t1412> <t1413>But sometimes it happens."</t1413> <t1414>-As she said this, she drifted into daydreams for a few seconds; -but then she came back to herself and said, "Come on, Edward," drawing Edward's attention to the subject, "This is the Barton valley.</t1414> <t1415>Look around and find peace if you can.</t1415> <t1416>Look at those hills!</t1416> <t1417>Have you ever seen anything like them?</t1417> <t1418>On the left is Barton Park, amidst the woods and fields.</t1418> <t1419>You can see a corner of the house.</t1419> <t1420>Over there, under that farthest hill rising majestically, is our cottage.</t1420><t1421>"</t1421>
<t1422>"The surroundings are very beautiful," replied Edward; "but these hollow places must get muddy in the winter.</t1422><t1423>"</t1423>
<t1424>"How can you think of mud when you have such things in front of you?"</t1424><t1425>"</t1425>
<t1426>"Because," said Edward, smiling, "among the other things in front of me, I see a very muddy road.</t1426><t1427>"</t1427>
<t1428>"How strange!" said Marianne to herself, as she continued to walk.</t1428>
<t1429>"Do you have good neighbors?</t1429> <t1430>Are the Middletons nice people?</t1430><t1431>"</t1431>
<t1432>"Oh no; not at all," replied Marianne, "we couldn't have settled in a more unfortunate place."</t1432><t1433>"</t1433>
<t1434>"Marianne," her sister cried, "how can you say such a thing?</t1434> <t1435>How can you be so unfair?</t1435> <t1436>Mr. Ferrars is from a very respectable family; they treat us in the most friendly manner.</t1436> <t1437>Have you forgotten, Marianne, how many wonderful days we spent thanks to them?</t1437><t1438>"</t1438>
<t1439>"No," Marianne said softly, "I haven't forgotten that I haven't had a moment without suffering either.</t1439><t1440>"</t1440>
<t1441>Elinor did not dwell on this; she focused her attention on her guest, talking about their current house, its amenities, and trying to engage in conversation with him by occasionally asking a question and receiving an answer.</t1441> <t1442>Edward's coldness and reserve severely irritated her; she felt overwhelmed and began to get angry; but she decided to base her behavior on the past rather than the present, avoiding appearing annoyed or unhappy, and treated him as she thought familial duty required.</t1442>
<t1443>Mrs. Dashwood was only momentarily surprised to see him; she thought it was the most natural thing for him to come to Barton.</t1443> <t1444>Her expressions of joy and satisfaction lasted much longer than her surprise.</t1444> <t1445>Edward was welcomed by her in the kindest manner; shyness, coldness, and distance could not resist such a reception.</t1445> <t1446>These had begun to weaken before they entered the house and were completely dispelled by Mrs. Dashwood's charming behavior.</t1446> <t1447>Indeed, he could not fall in love with any of her daughters without including her in his passion; Elinor was pleased to see that he soon behaved as expected of him.</t1447> <t1448>His feelings seemed to have revived towards the whole family, and his interest in their well-being became noticeable again.</t1448> <t1449>However, he was not cheerful; he complimented their home, admired the view, was attentive and kind; but still, he was not cheerful.</t1449> <t1450>The whole family noticed this; Mrs. Dashwood, thinking the reason was his mother's disapproval, sat down at the table, railing against all selfish parents.</t1450>
<t1451>"What are Mrs. Ferrars' current plans for you, Edward?" she said, when dinner was over and they gathered around the fire; "Are you being forced to become a great orator again?</t1451><t1452>"</t1452>
<t1453>"I hope my mother has believed that I not only lack the desire but also the talent to enter politics.</t1453><t1454>"</t1454>
<t1455>"But how will you become famous?</t1455> <t1456>Because you have to become famous to please your whole family; otherwise, it's difficult without a tendency to spend, without sympathy for strangers, without a profession, without security.</t1456><t1457>"</t1457>
<t1458>"I have no such intention.</t1458> <t1459>I don't want to be different; I have every reason to hope that I won't be.</t1459> <t1460>Thank goodness!</t1460> <t1461>I'm not going to be a genius and an orator by force.</t1461><t1462>"</t1462>
<t1463>"I know well that you are not ambitious.</t1463> <t1464>Your desires have always been moderate.</t1464><t1465>"</t1465>
<t1466>"I think most people's desires are as moderate as mine.</t1466> <t1467>I want to be as happy as everyone else; but everyone should be happy in their own way. Greatness does not make me happy.</t1467><t1468>"</t1468>
<t1469>"Does it ever!" cried Marianne.</t1469> <t1470>"What does wealth and splendor have to do with happiness?</t1470><t1471>"</t1471>
<t1472>"Splendor may not have much to do with it," said Elinor, "but wealth has a lot to do with it.</t1472><t1473>"</t1473>
<t1474>"But Elinor!" said Marianne; "money can only give happiness when there is nothing else to give happiness.</t1474> <t1475>Beyond sufficient income, nothing can truly satisfy when it comes to the human soul.</t1475><t1476>"</t1476>
<t1477>"Maybe," said Elinor with a smile, "we can agree on the same point.</t1477> <t1478>Your adequate income and my fortune seem very similar; considering the state of the world, we both agree that without them, every kind of external comfort would be lacking.</t1478> <t1479>Only your ideas are more noble than mine.</t1479> <t1480>Well, what is your adequate income?</t1480><t1481>"</t1481>
<t1482>"About one thousand eight hundred, two thousand a year; no more than that.</t1482><t1483>"</t1483>
<t1484>Elinor laughed, "Two thousand a year!</t1484> <t1485>That means a fortune to me!</t1485> <t1486>I knew it would end like this.</t1486><t1487>"</t1487>
<t1488>"But two thousand a year is a very modest income," said Marianne.</t1488> <t1489>"A family cannot live on less.</t1489> <t1490>I am sure my desires are not excessive.</t1490> <t1491>A reasonable establishment consisting of servants, one or two carriages, and hunting dogs cannot be maintained on less.</t1491><t1492>"</t1492>
<t1493>Elinor smiled again when she heard her sister so meticulously counting her future expenses at Combe Magna.</t1493>
<t1494>"Hunting dogs!" repeated Edward, "But why hunting dogs?</t1494> <t1495>Not everyone hunts.</t1495><t1496>"</t1496>
<t1497>Marianne blushed as she replied, "But some are hunted"</t1497>
<t1498>"I wish," said Margaret, introducing a new thought, "someone would come and give each of us a great fortune!</t1498><t1499>"</t1499>
<t1500>"Oh, if only he would give it!" cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with excitement, her cheeks glowing with the pleasure of such an imaginary happiness.</t1500>
<t1501>"I think we can all agree on this wish," said Elinor, "despite the insufficiency of wealth.</t1501><t1502>"</t1502>
<t1503>"Come on, let's go!" Margaret shouted, "how happy I would be!</t1503> <t1504>I would do so many things!</t1504><t1505>"</t1505>
<t1506>Marianne looked as if she had no doubt about it.</t1506>
<t1507>"If I were to spend a great fortune on my own, I would be confused," said Mrs. Dashwood, "even if all my children were rich without my help.</t1507><t1508>"</t1508>
<t1509>"You start with the renovation of the house," said Elinor, "and all your troubles will immediately pass.</t1509><t1510>"</t1510>
<t1511>"In that case," said Edward, "what tremendous orders must go from this family to London!</t1511> <t1512>What a happy day for the book, music, and art shops!</t1512> <t1513>You, Miss Dashwood, would give a general order for every new beautiful print to be sent to you - as for Marianne, I know the greatness of her soul, there is not enough music in London to console her.</t1513> <t1514>And books!</t1514> <t1515>-Thomson, Cowper, Scott; -she would buy them all over and over again; she would buy all the existing copies even, so they wouldn't fall into unworthy hands; she would buy every book that tells how to admire an old, crooked tree.</t1515> <t1516>Wouldn't you, Marianne?</t1516> <t1517>Forgive me if I have been too sarcastic.</t1517> <t1518>But I wanted to show that I haven't forgotten our old disputes.</t1518><t1519>"</t1519>
<t1520>"I have always enjoyed being reminded of the past, Edward - whether it is sorrowful or joyful, I love remembering the past - you will not offend me by talking about old times.</t1520> <t1521>You are absolutely right about how my money should be spent.</t1521> <t1522>At least a part of it - my disposable income would certainly go towards enhancing my music and book collection.</t1522><t1523>"</t1523>
<t1524>"Most of your fortune will also go to salaries for writers or their heirs."</t1524><t1525>"</t1525>
<t1526>"No Edward, I would do something else."</t1526><t1527>"</t1527>
<t1528>"Maybe you give a prize to the person who writes the best defense for your favorite saying, that is, in life, a person falls in love only once - I assume your opinion on this hasn't changed.</t1528><t1529>"</t1529>
<t1530>"No doubt.</t1530> <t1531>At my age, opinions are quite fixed. Now, it is impossible for me to see or hear anything that would change my mind.</t1531><t1532>"</t1532>
<t1533>"Marianne is as determined as ever, you see," said Elinor, "she hasn't changed at all.</t1533><t1534>"</t1534>
<t1535>"It's just gotten a bit more serious than before."</t1535><t1536>"</t1536>
<t1537>"Oh Edward," said Marianne, "don't you dare try to scold me.</t1537> <t1538>You are not very cheerful yourself.</t1538><t1539>"</t1539>
<t1540>"Why do you think that way?" replied Edward, sighing.</t1540> <t1541>"Joy has never been a part of my character.</t1541><t1542>"</t1542>
<t1543>"I don't think Marianne is a part of it either," said Elinor; "I can't really call her a lively girl - she is very, very enthusiastic in everything she does - sometimes she talks a lot and always speaks passionately - but generally, she is not truly cheerful.</t1543><t1544>"</t1544>
<t1545>"I suppose you are right," answered Edward, "yet I have always thought of her as a cheerful girl.</t1545><t1546>"</t1546>
<t1547>"I have often detected such mistakes in myself as well," said Elinor, "especially in terms of misjudging a character at one point or another: I have thought people to be much more cheerful or serious, intelligent or foolish than they actually are, and I don't really know the reason or where the error comes from.</t1547> <t1548>Sometimes the things people say about themselves, and often the things others say about them, are misleading, leaving no room for thought and decision-making.</t1548><t1549>"</t1549>
<t1550>"But I also, Elinor," said Marianne, "thought it was entirely right to be guided by the opinions of other people.</t1550> <t1551>I thought our own judgments were given to us only to be subject to the judgments of our neighbors.</t1551> <t1552>You always believed that, I'm sure.</t1552><t1553>"</t1553>
<t1554>"No Marianne, never.</t1554> <t1555>My belief has never aimed at the enslavement of the mind.</t1555> <t1556>The only thing I tried to influence was behavior.</t1556> <t1557>You must not distort the meaning of my words.</t1557> <t1558>I admit that I am guilty of often wishing you would behave more carefully in the presence of our acquaintances; but when did I ever advise you to adopt their feelings or to follow their judgments in serious matters?</t1558><t1559>"</t1559>
<t1560>"You still haven't managed to convince your sister of your general plan of conduct," said Edward to Elinor.</t1560> <t1561>"Haven't you made any progress at all?</t1561><t1562>"</t1562>
<t1563>"On the contrary," replied Elinor, looking at Marianne meaningfully.</t1563>
<t1564>"On this matter," continued Edward, "my opinion is with you; but I fear my actions are more aligned with your sister.</t1564> <t1565>I do not wish to offend anyone, but I have such a foolish shyness that I often appear neglectful, whereas it is merely my natural timidity that holds me back. Often, I have thought that perhaps nature created me for modest company; I never feel at ease among the wealthy.</t1565><t1566>"</t1566>
<t1567>"Marianne has no excuse like shyness to justify her carelessness," said Elinor.</t1567>
<t1568>"He knows his worth well enough not to succumb to a false shame," replied Edward.</t1568> <t1569>"Shyness is, in one way or another, an effect of an inferiority complex.</t1569> <t1570>If I could convince myself that my behavior is quite relaxed and graceful, I wouldn't be shy.</t1570><t1571>"</t1571>
<t1572>"But you would still be distant," said Marianne, "this is worse.</t1572><t1573>"</t1573>
<t1574>Edward looked intently "Distant! Am I distant, Marianne?</t1574><t1575>"</t1575>
<t1576>"Yes, quite a bit."</t1576><t1577>"</t1577>
<t1578>"I don't understand you," replied Edward, blushing.</t1578> <t1579>"Distant, huh! How - in what way?</t1579> <t1580>What should I tell you?</t1580> <t1581>How can you think like this?</t1581><t1582>"</t1582>
<t1583>Elinor was surprised by his reaction, but tried to brush it off with a laugh and said, "Don't you know my sister well enough to understand what she means?</t1583> <t1584>Don't you know that she calls anyone who doesn't speak as quickly as she does, or isn't as wildly enthusiastic about her admiration, distant?</t1584><t1585>"</t1585>
<t1586>Edward did not answer.</t1586> <t1587>His seriousness and thoughtfulness returned and settled upon him with all their weight - he sat there for a while, silent and sullen.</t1587>
<t1588>Elinor saw her friend's unhappiness with great discomfort.</t1588> <t1589>The visit had given her very limited satisfaction, and her friend did not seem to be very pleased with the visit either.</t1589> <t1590>It was clear that she was unhappy; Elinor wanted to make her realize that she still cared for her with the same feelings she was sure she had once aroused in her; but so far, whether her interest continued or not seemed very uncertain; the distance in her behavior towards her contradicted what a more emotional look had seemed to say the previous moment.</t1590>
<t1591>Edward joined her and Marianne in the breakfast room the next morning before the others came down; Marianne, who always took care to increase their happiness as much as she could, soon left them alone.</t1591> <t1592>But she had not gone halfway up the stairs when she heard the drawing room door open, and turning around, she saw Edward coming out with surprise.</t1592>
<t1593>"I'm going to the village to check on my horses," he said, "since breakfast isn't ready yet; I'll be back soon."</t1593><t1594>"</t1594>
<t1595>Edward returned with the excitement of being enamored with the region; during his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the valley; the village itself, situated at a much higher position than the cottage, provided a general view of the surroundings, and he had found the scenery extremely pleasing.</t1595> <t1596>Marianne's interest was certainly-</t1596>
<t1597>This was a topic he was passionate about; he was beginning to express his admiration for those images and to question her about the details that particularly caught his attention when Edward interrupted him, "Do not ask too many questions Marianne - remember, I have no knowledge of painting; if we delve into details, I will offend you with my ignorance and lack of taste.</t1597> <t1598>I call hills slopes, whereas they should be steep; I call surfaces strange and rough, whereas they should be irregular and wild; I say distant objects are not visible, whereas they should be described as barely discernible through the soft filter of a hazy atmosphere.</t1598> <t1599>You must be content with a description I can honestly give.</t1599> <t1600>I think this is a very beautiful region - the hills look like slopes, the forests seem full of beautiful trees, the valley appears calm and peaceful - there are rich meadows and neat village houses scattered here and there.</t1600> <t1601>It fits perfectly with my understanding of a beautiful region - in fact, I think it is picturesque too, because you admire it; I am sure it is full of rocks and promontories, old mosses and heathers, but I did not pay attention to these.</t1601> <t1602>I do not understand painting.</t1602><t1603>"</t1603>
<t1604>"I'm afraid this is very true," said Marianne, "but why are you boasting about it?</t1604><t1605>"</t1605>
<t1606>"I suppose," said Elinor, "that in trying to avoid one kind of affectation, Edward falls into another.</t1606> <t1607>Because he believes that most people pretend to admire the beauties of nature more than they actually do and hates this pretentiousness, he pretends to be more indifferent and less interested in these beauties than he truly is.</t1607> <t1608>Stubborn as he is, he must have an affectation of his own.</t1608><t1609>"</t1609>
<t1610>"Admiration of scenery," said Marianne, "has indeed become mere jargon.</t1610> <t1611>Everyone tries to describe it as if they possessed the taste and elegance of the first person who defined picturesque beauty.</t1611> <t1612>I hate all kinds of jargon; I have often had to keep my feelings to myself because I couldn't find a language to describe nature other than worn-out expressions that have lost all excitement and meaning.</t1612><t1613>"</t1613>
<t1614>"My belief is," said Edward, "you truly feel all the pleasure of a beautiful view as you say.</t1614> <t1615>But in return, your sister must accept that I do not feel more than what I have stated.</t1615> <t1616>I like a pleasant view, but not by pictorial principles.</t1616> <t1617>I do not like crooked, decayed trees.</t1617> <t1618>I admire them more if they are tall, straight, and healthy.</t1618> <t1619>I do not like dilapidated, rundown cottages.</t1619> <t1620>I have no interest in nettles, thistles, or wildflowers.</t1620> <t1621>A warm village house pleases me more than an observation tower — a neat, cheerful procession of villagers makes me happier than the most stylish bandits in the world.</t1621><t1622>"</t1622>
<t1623>Marianne looked at Edward with admiration and at her sister with pity.</t1623> <t1624>Elinor just smiled.</t1624>
<t1625>The matter was not pursued further; Marianne remained in a thoughtful silence until a new object suddenly caught her attention.</t1625> <t1626>She was sitting next to Edward; as Edward took his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed so close to her that a ring on one of his fingers, with a lock of hair in the middle, appeared very noticeable.</t1626>
<t1627>"I have never seen you wear a ring before, Edward," she exclaimed.</t1627> <t1628>"Is this Fanny's hair?</t1628> <t1629>I remember she promised you some hair.</t1629> <t1630>But I thought her hair was darker.</t1630><t1631>"</t1631>
<t1632>Marianne was indeed speaking her mind recklessly - but when she saw how much it unsettled Edward, her discomfort due to her thoughtlessness surpassed his.</t1632> <t1633>Edward had turned bright red; giving Elinor a brief glance, he replied, "Yes, my sister's hair.</t1633> <t1634>You know, the setting always gives it a different shade.</t1634><t1635>"</t1635>
<t1636>Elinor met his gaze; he also seemed embarrassed.</t1636> <t1637>At that moment, she felt as certain as Marianne that the hair was her own; the only difference between their conclusions was that Marianne thought the hair was a gift given by her sister, whereas Elinor knew that the hair must have been taken without her knowledge or obtained through some trick.</t1637> <t1638>On the other hand, she was not in the mood to be offended; pretending not to have noticed what had happened, she immediately started talking about something else, seizing every opportunity to look at the hair and make sure it matched the tone of her own hair.</t1638>
<t1639>Edward's discomfort continued for a while and ended in a deeper reverie.</t1639> <t1640>He behaved quite seriously all morning.</t1640> <t1641>Marianne severely scolded herself for what she had said; but if she knew how little she had offended her sister, she would have forgiven herself more quickly.</t1641>
<t1642>Sir John and Mrs. Jennings came to visit before noon; they had heard that a gentleman had come to the cottage and decided to go see the guest.</t1642> <t1643>With the help of his mother-in-law, Sir John quickly discovered that the name Ferrars started with an F; this prepared a rich source of teasing for the faithful Elinor, which nothing could prevent from being immediately exploited except for the newness of their acquaintance with Edward.</t1643> <t1644>Nevertheless, Mrs. Jennings, based on Margaret's data, quickly understood to what extent they had penetrated some very significant glances.</t1644>
<t1645>It was never the case that Sir John came to the Dashwoods without inviting them to dinner at the Park the next day or to tea that evening.</t1645> <t1646>This time, to better entertain his guests, he invited them both to dinner and to tea.</t1646>
<t1647>"You must come to our place for tea tonight," he said, "because we will be completely alone - and you must definitely come to our place for dinner tomorrow, because we will have a large group."</t1647><t1648>"</t1648>
<t1649>Mrs. Jennings increased the obligation.</t1649> <t1650>"And who knows, maybe you will dance," she said.</t1650> <t1651>"This will tempt you, Miss Marianne.</t1651><t1652>"</t1652>
<t1653>"Dance!" shouted Marianne.</t1653> <t1654>"Impossible! Who will dance?</t1654><t1655>"</t1655>
<t1656>"Who, me! Of course, you Careys, Whitakers.</t1656> <t1657>What, did you think no one could dance just because someone, who shall remain nameless, left!</t1657><t1658>"</t1658>
<t1659>"I wish," cried Sir John, "Willoughby were among us again."</t1659><t1660>"</t1660>
<t1661>This and the blush on Marianne's face aroused new suspicions in Edward.</t1661> <t1662>"Who is Willoughby?" he said in a low voice to Miss Dashwood, who was sitting beside him.</t1662>
<t1663>Miss Dashwood gave him a short answer.</t1663> <t1664>Marianne's facial expression conveyed much more.</t1664> <t1665>Edward was experienced enough to grasp not only the insinuations of others but also the kind of expressions that had previously confused Marianne; as soon as their guests left, he went to her and whispered, "I was making a guess.</t1665> <t1666>Shall I tell you my guess?</t1666><t1667>"</t1667>
<t1668>"What do you mean?</t1668><t1669>"</t1669>
<t1670>"Shall I say it?</t1670><t1671>"</t1671>
<t1672>"Of course.</t1672><t1673>"</t1673>
<t1674>"Alright; I suppose Mr. Willoughby is a hunter."</t1674><t1675>"</t1675>
<t1676>Marianne was surprised, she hesitated; still, she couldn't help but smile at the calm playfulness of her behavior and after a moment of silence, she said,</t1676>
<t1677>"Ah Edward! How is it possible?</t1677> <t1678>-But when the time comes, I hope... I'm sure you will like him.</t1678><t1679>"</t1679>
<t1680>"I have no doubt," replied Edward, somewhat surprised by Marianne's enthusiasm and warmth; for he would not have ventured to mention it if he had not thought it was merely a friendly joke based on something or nothing between Mr. Willoughby and Marianne.</t1680>
<t1681>Edward stayed in the cottage for a week; Mrs. Dashwood sincerely insisted that he stay longer; but as if his only purpose was to torment himself, he decided to leave when the happiness among his friends was at its peak.</t1681> <t1682>During the last two or three days, although his mood was still quite unstable, he had made considerable progress - he felt even closer to the house and its surroundings - every time he talked about leaving, he sighed - he declared that his future was empty - he even said he wasn't sure where he would go after leaving them - but still, he said he had to go.</t1682> <t1683>No week in his life had passed so quickly - he couldn't believe it was over.</t1683>
<t1684>He said this repeatedly; he also said other things that showed the change in my feelings and contradicted his actions.</t1684> <t1685>He could not be happy at Norland; he hated being in the city; but he had to go either to Norland or to London.</t1685> <t1686>He valued the closeness they showed more than anything, his greatest happiness was being with them.</t1686> <t1687>Yet he had to leave them over the weekend, even though neither he nor they wanted it, and even though he had no obligation to do so.</t1687>
<t1688>Elinor attributed such surprising behaviors to his mother; having a mother whose character she knew very little about was convenient for Elinor, because his mother became the general excuse for every peculiarity of her son.</t1688> <t1689>On the other hand, the insecure behavior towards her-</t1689>
<t1690>Even though she felt sad, stressed, and sometimes angry about their actions, she tended to evaluate them with genuine tolerance and generous understanding, which was the same attitude her mother had struggled to instill in her towards Willoughby.</t1690> <t1691>Edward's lack of cheerfulness, openness, and stability was generally attributed to his lack of independence and his keen awareness of Mrs. Ferrars' preferences and plans.</t1691> <t1692>The brevity of his visit and the definitiveness of his intention to leave them again stemmed from that same compelling inclination, that same necessity to comply with his mother's wishes.</t1692> <t1693>It was that old, unwavering sense of duty, the filial obligation, that was the cause of it all.</t1693> <t1694>Elinor dearly wished to know when these difficulties would end, when this opposition would cease, when Mrs. Ferrars would change, and when her son would have the freedom to be happy.</t1694> <t1695>But to find relief from these futile wishes, she had to renew her trust in Edward's love, recalling every sign of affection that appeared in his looks and words during his stay in Barton, and most of all, focusing on that flattering proof he constantly wore on his finger.</t1695>
<t1696>"I think, Edward," said Mrs. Dashwood, while they were having breakfast on their last morning, "you would be a happier man if you had a profession that would fill your time and give meaning to your plans and actions.</t1696> <t1697>Some of your friends might of course complain about this - after all, you wouldn't be able to spend as much time with them.</t1697> <t1698>But (smiling) at least you would have a serious gain in one respect.</t1698> <t1699>You would know where to go when you part from your friends.</t1699><t1700>"</t1700>
<t1701>"Rest assured," replied Edward, "like you, I have also thought long and hard about this matter.</t1701> <t1702>The fact that I do not have a job to occupy me, a profession to guide me or make me independent, has been a heavy misfortune for me, it still is, and it probably always will be.</t1702> <t1703>But unfortunately, my fondness for comfort and my family's fondness for comfort made me this way, that is, an idle, helpless person.</t1703> <t1704>We never reached a consensus in our choice of profession.</t1704> <t1705>I always wanted the church, and I still do.</t1705> <t1706>But this did not seem bright enough to my family.</t1706> <t1707>They recommended the army.</t1707> <t1708>That was too bright for me.</t1708> <t1709>Law was considered a sufficiently respectable profession; many young men with offices in the Judiciary made very good progress in high circles, delivering quite wise speeches as they roamed the city.</t1709> <t1710>But I had no inclination towards law, not even towards this less complicated education that my family approved of.</t1710> <t1711>As for the navy, it was quite fashionable, but by the time the subject came up, I was quite old - in the end, since I was not obliged to take up a job, and because I could live stylishly and expensively without a red uniform on my back, idleness ultimately seemed the most comfortable and respectable path; after all, an eighteen-year-old boy is not eager enough to take up a job to resist the advice of his friends who do nothing.</t1711> <t1712>I entered Oxford again; and since then, I have been idling away nicely.</t1712><t1713>"</t1713>
<t1714>"As a result, surely," said Mrs. Dashwood, "since idleness does not make you happy, you will raise your sons by immersing them in work, just like Columella's sons.</t1714><t1715>"</t1715>
<t1716>"My sons," he said with a serious tone, "will be raised as differently from me as possible.</t1716> <t1717>In terms of emotion, behavior, status, in every way.</t1717><t1718>"</t1718>
<t1719>"Come on, dear; these are just the effects of your current melancholy, Edward.</t1719> <t1720>You are in a sad state of mind and you think everyone who is not like you is happy.</t1720> <t1721>Remember, everyone feels the pain of parting from friends from time to time, regardless of their education or status.</t1721> <t1722>Recognize your own happiness.</t1722> <t1723>You need nothing but patience - or let's give it a nicer name, let's call it hope.</t1723> <t1724>Your mother will provide the independence you long for in due time; that is her duty; it will soon be her greatest happiness to prevent all your youth from being wasted in sorrow.</t1724> <t1725>What can't happen in a few months?</t1725><t1726>"</t1726>
<t1727>"It seems to me," replied Edward, "that even if months pass, it will be of no use to me.</t1727><t1728>"</t1728>
<t1729>This hopeless state of mind, though it could not be explained to Mrs. Dashwood, saddened everyone even more during the farewell that soon followed, and left an uneasy mark on Elinor's emotions that would require time and effort to overcome.</t1729> <t1730>But since Elinor was determined to overcome this and not to appear to suffer more than the rest of the family from Edward's departure, she did not adopt the method of seeking silence, solitude, and idleness that Marianne clung to in order to magnify and fix her sorrow in a similar situation.</t1730> <t1731>Their means were as different as their goals, and each was equally suited to the path they would take in life.</t1731>
<t1732>As soon as Edward left the house, Elinor sat down at the drawing table and kept herself busy all day; she neither tried to mention his name nor avoided mentioning it; she appeared as interested in the usual family matters as ever, and if this behavior did not lessen her own pain, at least it did not unnecessarily increase it; her mother and sisters also did not have to deal with her.</t1732>
<t1733>This behavior, which was the exact opposite of her own, did not seem more virtuous to Marianne than her own behavior seemed faulty.</t1733> <t1734>She had handled the task of self-control quite easily - if the emotions were strong, it would have been impossible, and if the emotions were calm, it wouldn't be considered a virtue anyway.</t1734> <t1735>She did not attempt to deny that her sister's emotions were calm, but accepting this made her blush; despite this annoying belief about the strength of her own emotions, she still provided a very striking proof by loving and respecting her sister.</t1735>
<t1736>Without running away from her family and locking herself in her room, or leaving the house in a determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake all night to drown in sorrows, Elinor found that each day gave her enough free time to think about Edward and Edward's behavior in every possible variety created by different moods at different times - with affection, pity, approval, disapproval, and doubt.</t1736> <t1737>Not because of the absence of her mother and sister, but at least due to the nature of their occupations, when conversation between them was not possible and every kind of solitude effect was created, she had plenty of time.</t1737> <t1738>Her mind was inevitably free; her thoughts could not be chained anywhere else; the past and the future, having come before her on such an interesting subject, must have compelled her attention, overwhelmed her memory, thinking, and imagination.</t1738>
<t1739>While sitting at the drawing table, Edward woke up from such a reverie one morning with the arrival of guests just after he had left them.</t1739> <t1740>It was a moment when he was completely alone.</t1740> <t1741>The closing of the small gate at the entrance of the green courtyard in front of the house drew his eyes to the window, and he saw a large group walking towards the door.</t1741> <t1742>Among them were Sir John, Lady Middleton, and Mrs. Jennings, but there were two other people, a lady and a gentleman, whom he did not know.</t1742> <t1743>He was sitting close to the window; as soon as Sir John saw him, he left the others to the door-knocking ceremony and crossed the lawn, compelling him to open the window to talk, despite the distance between the window and the door being so short that it made it impossible to speak at one without being heard at the other.</t1743>
<t1744>"Look," he said, "I brought you some strangers.</t1744> <t1745>Do you like them?</t1745><t1746>"</t1746>
<t1747>"Quiet! They will hear you."</t1747><t1748>"</t1748>
<t1749>"Let them hear.</t1749> <t1750>It's just the Palmers, dear.</t1750> <t1751>Charlotte is very sweet, believe me.</t1751> <t1752>If you look this way, you can see her.</t1752><t1753>"</t1753>
<t1754>Elinor excused herself, confident that she would see him within a few minutes without using that opportunity.</t1754>
<t1755>"Where is Marianne?</t1755> <t1756>Did she run away because we were coming?</t1756> <t1757>I see that her piano is open.</t1757><t1758>"</t1758>
<t1759>"She is walking, I think.</t1759><t1760>"</t1760>
<t1761>Mrs. Jennings came to them immediately; she had no patience to wait until the door was opened to tell her story.</t1761> <t1762>She rushed to the window in a hurry, "How are you, dear? How is Mrs. Dashwood?</t1762> <t1763>Where are your sisters?</t1763> <t1764>What! Are you alone!</t1764> <t1765>Then you would like to have some company.</t1765> <t1766>I brought my other son-in-law and daughter to see you.</t1766> <t1767>How suddenly they came!</t1767> <t1768>Last night I thought I heard the sound of a carriage, we were sitting and having tea, but it never occurred to me that it could be them.</t1768> <t1769>I couldn't think of anything else but whether Colonel Brandon had returned; I told John again, I think I heard the sound of a carriage; maybe Colonel Brandon has returned"-</t1769>
<t1770>Elinor had to turn her head away from him in the middle of her story to greet the rest of the group; Lady Middleton introduced two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down the stairs at the same time and they all sat down and looked at each other; meanwhile, Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked from the hall to the drawing-room accompanied by Sir John.</t1770>
<t1771>Mrs. Palmer was a few years younger than Lady Middleton and was very different from her in every way.</t1771> <t1772>She was short and plump, had a very beautiful face, and the most pleasant expression of goodwill possible on her face.</t1772> <t1773>Her manners were not as elegant as her sister's, but they were much more sincere.</t1773> <t1774>She entered with a smile, smiled throughout the visit, except when she laughed, and was still smiling when she left.</t1774> <t1775>Her husband was a serious-looking man of twenty-five or twenty-six, who paid more attention to decorum than his wife but seemed less willing to be pleased or to please.</t1775> <t1776>He entered the room with an air of self-importance, greeted the ladies with a slight bow without saying a word, briefly surveyed them and the room, then took a newspaper from the table and read it for the duration of his stay.</t1776>
<t1777>Mrs. Palmer, on the other hand, endowed with a tendency to be kind and pleased, almost couldn't find the opportunity to sit down as she showered the room and everything in it with her admiration.</t1777>
<t1778>"What a delightful room this is!</t1778> <t1779>I have never seen anything so beautiful!</t1779> <t1780>Remember, mother, how it has changed since I last came!</t1780> <t1781>I have always thought this place was very charming, madam!</t1781> <t1782>(Turning to Mrs. Dashwood) But you have made it exceedingly beautiful!</t1782> <t1783>Look, sister, how delightful everything is!</t1783> <t1784>How I wish I had a house like this!</t1784> <t1785>Don't you wish so too, Mr. Palmer?</t1785><t1786>"</t1786>
<t1787>Mr. Palmer did not reply, he did not even lift his eyes from the newspaper.</t1787>
<t1788>"Mr. Palmer doesn't hear me," she said, laughing, "sometimes he just doesn't.</t1788> <t1789>So funny!</t1789><t1790>"</t1790>
<t1791>This was a completely new idea for Mrs. Dashwood; she was not accustomed to finding a spark of intelligence in anyone's carelessness, and she couldn't help but look at both of them with a bit of astonishment.</t1791>
<t1792>Mrs. Jennings, meanwhile, was speaking as loudly as she could, continuing to recount how surprised they were to see her daughter and son-in-law the previous evening, and she had no intention of stopping until everything was told.</t1792> <t1793>Mrs. Palmer was laughing heartily at the recollection of their surprise; everyone agreed two or three times in a row that it was a very pleasant surprise.</t1793>
<t1794>"You can imagine how delighted we all were to see them," added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor and speaking in a low voice as if she didn't want anyone else to hear, even though they were sitting on different sides of the room; "but still, I can't help but wish they hadn't come so quickly, hadn't traveled so far, because they came via London due to business, and you know (nodding meaningfully and gesturing towards her daughter) in her condition, it's not right.</t1794> <t1795>This morning I wanted her to stay home and rest, but she insisted on coming with us; she was very eager to see you all!</t1795><t1796>"</t1796>
<t1797>Mrs. Palmer laughed and said it wouldn't harm her.</t1797>
<t1798>"She is expecting to give birth in February," continued Mrs. Jennings.</t1798>
<t1799>Lady Middleton could not endure such a conversation any longer and stepped forward to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the newspaper.</t1799>
<t1800>"No, there is nothing," replied Mr. Palmer and continued reading.</t1800>
<t1801>"Here comes Marianne," exclaimed Sir John.</t1801> <t1802>"Come on Palmer, you will see a terribly sweet girl.</t1802><t1803>"</t1803>
<t1804>He immediately went to the hall, opened the front door, and invited her in himself.</t1804> <t1805>As soon as Mrs. Jennings appeared, she asked if she had gone to Allenham; Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question that it showed she understood.</t1805> <t1806>Mr. Palmer looked up as she entered the room, stared at her for a few seconds, then returned to his newspaper.</t1806> <t1807>At that moment, Mrs. Palmer's eyes were caught by the pictures hanging on the walls of the room.</t1807> <t1808>She got up to examine the pictures.</t1808>
<t1809>"Oh! What beautiful things these are!"</t1809> <t1810>"Wow! How delightful!"</t1810> <t1811>"Look, mom, how sweet!"</t1811> <t1812>"I think they are very beautiful; I could look at them forever."</t1812> <t1813>Then she sat down again and soon forgot that such things existed in the room.</t1813>
<t1814>When Lady Middleton got up to leave, Mr. Palmer also stood up, put the newspaper back in its place, stretched, and looked around at those present.</t1814>
<t1815>"My love, were you sleeping?" said his wife, laughing.</t1815>
<t1816>Mr. Palmer did not respond; he merely contented himself with observing once again that the room had a very low ceiling and that the ceiling was crooked.</t1816> <t1817>Then, bowing, he greeted and left with the others.</t1817>
<t1818>Sir John insisted very much on spending the next day all together at the Park.</t1818> <t1819>Mrs. Dashwood, who did not want to dine with them at the cottage more often, definitely refused the offer on her own behalf; her daughters could do as they wished.</t1819> <t1820>But they were not curious about how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer dined, nor did they expect any other pleasure from them.</t1820> <t1821>So they tried to make the same excuse; the weather was uncertain and did not seem to be good.</t1821> <t1822>But Sir John did not accept - a carriage would be sent for them, and they would come.</t1822> <t1823>Lady Middleton, although she did not insist on their mother, insisted on them.</t1823> <t1824>Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their pleas; they all seemed to want to avoid the family gathering; the young ladies had to say yes.</t1824>
<t1825>"Why would they want us?" said Marianne, as soon as they left.</t1825> <t1826>"It is said that the rent of this cottage is low; but if every time they or we have guests we are to dine at the Park, it means we have taken this place under very harsh conditions.</t1826><t1827>"</t1827>
<t1828>"These frequent invitations have no other purpose than to be polite and courteous to us," said Elinor; "these are just like the invitations we received a few weeks ago.</t1828> <t1829>If their friendships have become boring and dull, it is not because they have changed.</t1829> <t1830>We need to look for the change elsewhere.</t1830><t1831>"</t1831>
<t1832>The next day, as the Miss Dashwoods were entering the Park's sitting room through one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in through another door, looking as good-natured and cheerful as before.</t1832> <t1833>She affectionately took them all by the hand and expressed how happy she was to see them again.</t1833>
<t1834>"I am so glad to see you!" she said, sitting between Elinor and Marianne, "I was afraid you might not come because it is such a bad day, and it would have been terrible if you hadn't come because we are leaving again tomorrow.</t1834> <t1835>We have to go because the Westons are coming to us next week, you know.</t1835> <t1836>Our coming was quite a sudden thing; I didn't know about it until the carriage pulled up to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked if I would go to Barton with him.</t1836> <t1837>He is such a strange person!</t1837> <t1838>He never tells me anything!</t1838> <t1839>I'm sorry we can't stay longer; however, I hope we will see each other again very soon in town.</t1839><t1840>"</t1840>
<t1841>They felt the need to put an end to such a hope.</t1841>
<t1842>"Aren't you going to the city!" Mrs. Palmer exclaimed with a laugh, "I would be terribly disappointed if you don't go.</t1842> <t1843>I will rent the most beautiful house in the world for you, right next to our house in Hanover-square.</t1843> <t1844>You really must come.</t1844> <t1845>If Mrs. Dashwood doesn't want to go out in public, I'm sure she would be happy to accompany you at any time until the birth.</t1845><t1846>"</t1846>
<t1847>They thanked her; but they had to resist all her insistence.</t1847>
<t1848>"Ah, my dear," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband who had just entered the room, "you must help me persuade the Miss Dashwoods to come to town this winter."</t1848><t1849>"</t1849>
<t1850>His lover did not respond; after lightly greeting the ladies, he began to complain about the weather.</t1850>
<t1851>"What a terrible thing this is!" he said.</t1851> <t1852>"This weather makes everything and everyone disgusting. Because of the rain, the inside is as boring as the outside. It makes you hate even your acquaintances. Why on earth doesn't Sir John have a billiard room in his house?</t1852> <t1853>How few people understand comfort!</t1853> <t1854>Sir John is as stupid as the weather.</t1854><t1855>"</t1855>
<t1856>The rest of the group trickled in shortly after.</t1856>
<t1857>"I'm afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John, "you did not take your usual walk to Allenham today."</t1857><t1858>"</t1858>
<t1859>Marianne looked very serious and said nothing.</t1859>
<t1860>"Come on, don't be so grumpy in front of us," said Mrs. Palmer; "we know everything, believe me; I also greatly admire your taste because I find him very handsome too."</t1860> <t1861>"Our place in the village is not very far from him, you know."</t1861> <t1862>"It is probably no more than ten miles."</t1862><t1863>"</t1863>
<t1864>"Around thirty," said her husband.</t1864>
<t1865>"Anyway, the same thing.</t1865> <t1866>I've never been to his house; but they say it's a nice, sweet place.</t1866><t1867>"</t1867>
<t1868>"The worst place I've ever seen in my life," said Mr. Palmer.</t1868>
<t1869>Marianne remained silent, even though her face betrayed an interest in what was being said.</t1869>
<t1870>"Is it that bad?" continued Mrs. Palmer, "then there must be another place that is that sweet."</t1870><t1871>"</t1871>
<t1872>When they sat in the dining room, Sir John lamented that there were only eight of them.</t1872>
<t1873>"My dear," he said to his wife, "being so few of us is quite provocative.</t1873> <t1874>Why didn't you tell the Gilberts to come over today?</t1874><t1875>"</t1875>
<t1876>"Didn't I tell you, Sir John, the last time you mentioned it, that it wouldn't work?</t1876> <t1877>They were with us just yesterday.</t1877><t1878>"</t1878>
<t1879>"You and I, Sir John," said Mrs. Jennings, "we never come to such ceremonies.</t1879><t1880>"</t1880>
<t1881>"Then you are very uncouth," exclaimed Mr. Palmer.</t1881>
<t1882>"My dear, you argue with everyone," said his wife with her usual smile.</t1882> <t1883>"Do you know how rude you are?</t1883><t1884>"</t1884>
<t1885>"I don't think I've argued with anyone by calling their mother uncultured."</t1885><t1886>"</t1886>
<t1887>"Alright, you can harass me as you wish," said the good-natured old lady, "You took Charlotte from me once, you can't give her back again.</t1887> <t1888>So, I'm in a better position than you.</t1888><t1889>"</t1889>
<t1890>Charlotte laughed heartily at the thought that her husband could not get rid of her and said, almost losing herself, that she did not care how grumpy her husband was towards her because they had to live together.</t1890> <t1891>No one could be more gentle or more determined to be happy than Mrs. Palmer.</t1891> <t1892>Her husband's studied indifference, rudeness, and discontent did not hurt her: when he scolded or harassed her, she would simply turn her attention elsewhere.</t1892>
<t1893>"Mr. Palmer is very peculiar!" she said to Elinor, in a whisper.</t1893> <t1894>"He is always in a bad mood.</t1894><t1895>"</t1895>
<t1896>After a brief observation, Elinor was not willing to accept that the man was as genuinely and naturally ill-tempered or rude as he appeared to be.</t1896> <t1897>Like many other examples of his kind, his temperament might have been soured by the inexplicable preference for beauty that had made him the husband of a very foolish woman, -but Elinor knew that such a mistake was so common that no reasonable man would suffer from it forever.</t1897> <t1898>She thought that what led to his disdainful behavior towards everyone and his contempt for everything in front of him was more a desire for privilege.</t1898> <t1899>It was the desire to appear superior to others.</t1899> <t1900>This desire was so common that it was not surprising; but although the means he used might secure his superiority in being rude, they did not seem likely to bring anyone closer to him except his wife.</t1900>
<t1901>"Ah dear Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Palmer shortly after, "I have a great favor to ask of you and your sister.</t1901> <t1902>Would you come to Cleveland this Christmas and stay for a while?</t1902> <t1903>Oh please come, -and come while the Westons are with us.</t1903> <t1904>-You can't imagine how happy I would be!</t1904> <t1905>It would be extraordinarily delightful!</t1905> <t1906>-My dear," turning to her husband, "wouldn't you like the Miss Dashwoods to come to Cleveland?</t1906><t1907>"</t1907>
<t1908>"Of course," her husband replied, curling his lip, "this was my only purpose in coming to Devonshire."</t1908><t1909>"</t1909>
<t1910>"Look," said his wife, "you see, Mr. Palmer is also waiting for you; therefore, you cannot refuse to come."</t1910><t1911>"</t1911>
<t1912>They both fervently and resolutely declined the invitation.</t1912>
<t1913>"But of course you must come and you will come.</t1913> <t1914>I am sure you will love it there.</t1914> <t1915>-The Westons will be with us and it will be very enjoyable.</t1915> <t1916>You can't imagine how sweet a place Cleveland is; we are very cheerful now because Mr. Palmer is constantly touring the villages for election campaigns; so many people come for dinner whom I have never seen before, it is quite nice!</t1916> <t1917>But poor man!</t1917> <t1918>It is very tiring for him!</t1918> <t1919>Because he is trying to make everyone like him.</t1919><t1920>"</t1920>
<t1921>Elinor was struggling not to laugh as she accepted the difficulty of such a task.</t1921>
<t1922>"It will be very nice," said Charlotte, "when you get into Parliament! -won't it?</t1922> <t1923>How I will laugh!</t1923> <t1924>It will be so funny to see your letters addressed as Honorable Member.</t1924> <t1925>-But you know, my letters won't get any special treatment.</t1925> <t1926>He says it won't happen.</t1926> <t1927>Isn't that right, Mr. Palmer?</t1927><t1928>"</t1928>
<t1929>Mr. Palmer didn't care about it.</t1929>
<t1930>"He can't stand writing," he continued, "he says it's very boring."</t1930><t1931>"</t1931>
<t1932>"No;" said Mr. Palmer, "I never said such an irrational thing.</t1932> <t1933>Don't try to pin all the language mistakes on me.</t1933><t1934>"</t1934>
<t1935>"Here you go; how strange, you see.</t1935> <t1936>It's always like this!</t1936> <t1937>Sometimes she doesn't talk to me for half a day, and then she comes up with something strange like this - just for the sake of talking.</t1937><t1938>"</t1938>
<t1939>While they were returning to the living room, she surprised Elinor quite a bit by asking if she liked Mr. Palmer very much.</t1939>
<t1940>"Of course," said Elinor, "he seems like a very nice person.</t1940><t1941>"</t1941>
<t1942>"I'm glad you liked it.</t1942> <t1943>I already thought you would like it because it is very cute; Mr. Palmer also liked you and your siblings very much, I think; I can't tell you how upset he would be if you don't come to Cleveland.</t1943> <t1944>-I can't understand your objection anyway.</t1944><t1945>"</t1945>
<t1946>Elinor had to decline the invitation once again; she changed the subject to put an end to their insistence.</t1946> <t1947>Since they lived in the same county, she considered it likely that Mrs. Palmer could provide more detailed information about Willoughby's general character than the Middletons, who only knew him partially, and she was very eager to get confirmation of any qualities that could eliminate the possibility of the young man being a danger to Marianne, from anyone.</t1947> <t1948>She began by asking if they saw Mr. Willoughby often at Cleveland and if they knew him well.</t1948>
<t1949>"Oh yes, my dear; I know him very well," replied Mrs. Palmer. "I haven't actually spoken to him; but I always see him in town.</t1949> <t1950>Once, when he was in Allenham, I happened to be staying in Barton.</t1950> <t1951>My mother saw him here once; -but I was with my uncle in Weymouth.</t1951> <t1952>However, I could say that we saw him a lot in Somersetshire, but unfortunately, we were never together in the village.</t1952> <t1953>I think he rarely stays in Combe: but even if he stayed more, I don't think Mr. Palmer would visit him, because he's in the opposition, you know, and besides, it's very far.</t1953> <t1954>I know why you're asking about him; your brother is going to marry him.</t1954> <t1955>I'm terribly happy about this, because your brother will be my neighbor.</t1955><t1956>"</t1956>
<t1957>"Believe me," replied Elinor, "you know the matter better than I do, as you have a reason to expect such a marriage.</t1957><t1958>"</t1958>
<t1959>"Don't pretend like you're denying it, because obviously, everyone is talking about it.</t1959> <t1960>Believe me, I heard it in the city on my way here.</t1960><t1961>"</t1961>
<t1962>"Amen Mrs. Palmer!"</t1962><t1963>"</t1963>
<t1964>"I swear, it's true. On Monday morning, I ran into Colonel Brandon on Bond Street, just before we left the city; and he told me directly."</t1964><t1965>"</t1965>
<t1966>"You are surprising me.</t1966> <t1967>Colonel Brandon told you!</t1967> <t1968>You must be mistaken.</t1968> <t1969>To give such news to someone who could have no concern with it, even if it were true, is not something I would expect from Colonel Brandon.</t1969><t1970>"</t1970>
<t1971>"But I assure you, it happened that way, and let me tell you how it happened.</t1971> <t1972>When we ran into him, he turned back and walked with us; we started talking about my sister and brother-in-law, and as we chatted about this and that, I said to him, 'Well, Colonel, I heard that a new family has moved into Barton Cottage, my mother sent word, she says they are very sweet people, and one of them is going to marry Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.</t1972> <t1973>Is it true?</t1973> <t1974>Because you must know, since you have just been in Devonshire.</t1974><t1975>'"</t1975>
<t1976>"So, what did the Colonel say?"</t1976><t1977>"</t1977>
<t1978>"Ha! -He didn't say much; but he looked as if he knew it was true, that's when I realized it was certain.</t1978> <t1979>I think it will be very enjoyable!</t1979> <t1980>When is the wedding?</t1980><t1981>"</t1981>
<t1982>"I hope Mr. Brandon was well."</t1982><t1983>"</t1983>
<t1984>"Oh yes, very well; he couldn't praise you enough, he said very nice things about you.</t1984><t1985>"</t1985>
<t1986>"The praises flattered my pride.</t1986> <t1987>He seems like a wonderful man; I find him extraordinarily charming.</t1987><t1988>"</t1988>
<t1989>"Me too.</t1989> <t1990>-He is such an attractive man, it's a shame he is so serious and so boring.</t1990> <t1991>My mother says he is in love with his sister too.</t1991> <t1992>-Be sure that his being in love is a great compliment; because he doesn't easily fall in love with anyone.</t1992><t1993>"</t1993>
<t1994>"Is Mr. Willoughby well known in Somersetshire?" said Elinor.</t1994>
<t1995>"Yes, quite well; I mean, I don't think many people know him, because Combe Magna is very far away; but I assure you everyone thinks he is an extremely good person.</t1995> <t1996>Wherever he goes, no one is more loved than Mr. Willoughby, you can tell your sister that.</t1996> <t1997>She is incredibly lucky to have caught his attention, I swear; no, he is even luckier to have caught her attention, because she is a very beautiful and charming girl, deserving of everything.</t1997> <t1998>However, I don't think she is more beautiful than you, rest assured; I think both of you are extremely beautiful and I am sure Mr. Palmer thinks so too, even if we couldn't get him to admit it last night.</t1998><t1999>"</t1999>
<t2000>Mrs. Palmer's knowledge about Willoughby was not very substantial; but every testimony in favor of the young man, no matter how small, was pleasing to her.</t2000>
<t2001>"I'm very pleased that we finally met," Charlotte continued.</t2001> <t2002>"Now I hope we will always be very good friends.</t2002> <t2003>You can't imagine how much I wanted to see you!</t2003> <t2004>Living in the cottage is so delightful! Believe me, no place can be like it!</t2004> <t2005>I'm so glad that your sister is making a good marriage!</t2005> <t2006>I hope you come to Combe Magna often.</t2006> <t2007>It is a sweet place in every respect.</t2007><t2008>"</t2008>
<t2009>"You've known Colonel Brandon for a long time, haven't you?</t2009><t2010>"</t2010>
<t2011>"Yes, for a very long time; since my sister got married.</t2011> <t2012>- He was a close friend of Sir John.</t2012> <t2013>Probably," she added in a low voice, "he would have very much liked to marry me, if it had been possible.</t2013> <t2014>Sir John and Lady Middleton also wanted it very much.</t2014> <t2015>But my mother thought he wasn't a good enough match for me, otherwise Sir John would have spoken to the Colonel about the matter, and we would have married immediately.</t2015><t2016>"</t2016>
<t2017>"Didn't Colonel Brandon already know about the offer Sir John made to your mother?</t2017> <t2018>Didn't he tell you that he loved you?</t2018><t2019>"</t2019>
<t2020>"No, but if my mother hadn't objected, I think she would have wanted this more than anything.</t2020> <t2021>At that time, she had only seen me twice, because it was before I left school.</t2021> <t2022>However, I am very happy this way too.</t2022> <t2023>Mr. Palmer is exactly the kind of man I like.</t2023><t2024>"</t2024>
<t2025>Bö/ara XXI</t2025>
<t2026>The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families in Barton were once again left to entertain each other.</t2026> <t2027>But this did not last long; Elinor had just managed to put her last visitors out of her mind, had just finished marveling at Charlotte's inexplicable happiness, Mr. Palmer's simplicity despite his significant talents, and the frequent strange discord between husband and wife, when the social zeal of Sir John and Mrs. Jennings brought her another new acquaintance to meet and observe.</t2027>
<t2028>One morning on their journey to Exeter, they had encountered two young ladies; Mrs. Jennings was delighted to learn that the ladies were their relatives, which was enough for Sir John to invite them to the Park as soon as they finished their business in Exeter.</t2028> <t2029>Their business in Exeter quickly succumbed to such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was quite flustered upon Sir John’s return, learning that she would soon host two girls she had never seen in her life, whose manners, or even reasonable politeness, she was not sure of; her husband’s and mother’s efforts to reassure her on this matter were in vain.</t2029> <t2030>The fact that the girls were relatives made the situation even worse; Mrs. Jennings’ attempts to console her daughter by advising her not to care so much about appearances, reminding her that after all, they were all cousins and should manage each other, also failed.</t2030>
<t2031>so it turned out to be an unfortunate idea.</t2031> <t2032>Since it was now impossible to prevent their arrival, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the matter with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman and consoled herself by gently scolding her husband five or six times a day because of it.</t2032>
<t2033>The young ladies arrived; their appearance was by no means lacking in elegance or display.</t2033> <t2034>Their clothes were very nice, their manners were very polite; they adored the house, admired the furniture, and showed such affection towards the children that within an hour of their arrival, they had won Lady Middleton's favor.</t2034> <t2035>Lady Middleton said they were very charming girls, which was a great compliment coming from her ladyship.</t2035> <t2036>Sir John's confidence in his own judgment was bolstered by this enthusiastic praise, and he headed straight to the cottage to inform the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival and to convince them that these two were the sweetest girls in the world.</t2036> <t2037>However, there was little to be learned from such a commendation; Elinor knew well that one could encounter the sweetest girls in the world all over England, in every possible shape, face, temperament, and intellect.</t2037> <t2038>-Sir John wanted the whole family to walk straight to the Park to see his guests.</t2038> <t2039>Enthusiastic, benevolent man!</t2039> <t2040>Even keeping a third-degree cousin to himself was difficult for him.</t2040>
<t2041>"Come on, let's go," he said -"please come -you must come -I'm telling you, you will come.</t2041><t2042>-You can't even imagine how much you'll like them.</t2042><t2043>Lucy is terribly beautiful, very good-natured, and friendly!</t2043><t2044>The children have already clung to her skirt, as if she were an old relative.</t2044><t2045>Both of them want to see you the most, because they heard in Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I told them it's all true and even more.</t2045><t2046>I'm sure you'll enjoy them very much.</t2046><t2047>They brought a whole carload of toys for the children.</t2047><t2048>How could you possibly make the mistake of not coming?</t2048><t2049>They are your cousins too, in a way.</t2049><t2050>You are my cousin, they are my wife's, so you are relatives.</t2050><t2051>"</t2051>
<t2052>Sir John couldn't achieve his goal.</t2052> <t2053>He could only get a promise that they would visit the Park in a day or two, and left in astonishment at their indifference, to walk home and praise them to the Miss Steeles just as he had praised the Miss Steeles to them.</t2053>
<t2054>When the promised visit to the Park and the subsequent introductions to those young ladies took place, they found almost nothing to admire in the appearance of the elder, who was nearly thirty, very ordinary, and vacant-faced; but they acknowledged that the other, who was at most twenty-two or twenty-three, possessed considerable beauty; her features were very pleasing, she had a sharp, quick eye and a bright demeanor, which, even if it did not bestow true elegance or nobility, certainly added a touch of distinction.</t2054><t2055>Their manners were quite refined; Elinor soon conceded that they possessed a certain intelligence when she observed the steady and skillful attention with which they ingratiated themselves with Lady Middleton.</t2055><t2056>They were constantly cheerful with the children, praising their beauty, attracting their attention, and yielding to all their whims; the time they could spare from these persistent demands of politeness was spent either admiring whatever Lady Middleton happened to be doing or replicating the pattern of an elegant new dress she had worn the previous day, which had given them immense delight.</t2056><t2057>Fortunately for those who display their flattery through such weaknesses, a doting mother, eager for her children to be admired, is also the most gullible of people; her demands are excessive, but she swallows everything; and thus the exceptional affection and patience Miss Steeles showed towards her children were met by Lady Middleton without the slightest surprise or suspicion.</t2057><t2058>She watched with maternal tranquility all the insolent intrusions and deceitful tricks to which her cousins submitted.</t2058><t2059>She saw their sashes being pulled, their hair being scattered over their ears, their workbags being ransacked, and their knives and scissors being stolen, and she never doubted that it was all a shared amusement.</t2059><t2060>The truly surprising thing was that Elinor and Marianne sat quietly on the sidelines, wanting no part in what was happening.</t2060>
<t2061>"John is very cheerful today!" she said, when the boy took Miss Steele's handkerchief and threw it out the window, "He sure knows a lot of games."</t2061><t2062></t2062>
<t2063>Immediately after, when the second boy pinched the same lady's finger, she lovingly said, "William is so playful!"</t2063>
<t2064>"Ah, here is my one and only Annamaria," he added, tenderly stroking his three-year-old daughter who had been silent for the last two minutes; "She is always so delicate and well-behaved -Such a well-behaved little one has never been seen in life!</t2064><t2065>"</t2065>
<t2066>But alas, while bestowing these embraces, a pin in the lady's hair ornament lightly scratched the child's neck, causing such intense screams from that epitome of delicacy that even someone notorious for being noisy would pale in comparison.</t2066><t2067>The mother's horror was great, but what was it compared to the panic of the Miss Steeles; in such a critical emergency, the three of them did everything together; they tried every possibility that could alleviate the little one's suffering.</t2067><t2068>He was seated on his mother's lap, showered with kisses, his wound washed with lavender water by a kneeling Miss Steele attending to him, and his mouth filled with plum sugar by the other Miss Steele.</t2068><t2069>Receiving such a reward in exchange for his tears, the child was smart enough not to stop crying.</t2069><t2070>He continued to cry loudly, kicked his two brothers who attempted to touch him; despite all efforts to soothe him, it was in vain, until Lady Middleton suddenly remembered that a bit of apricot marmalade had been successfully applied to a bruised temple in a similar distressing situation last week, and the same remedy was fervently recommended for this unfortunate scratch; hearing this, the young lady's screams paused slightly, giving them hope that it would not be rejected.</t2070><t2071>Thereupon, he was carried out of the room in his mother's arms in pursuit of that remedy; although their mother begged them to stay in the room, the two boys followed behind, and the four young ladies were left in a silence the room had not seen for hours.</t2071>
<t2072>"Poor thing!" said Miss Steele, as soon as they left.</t2072> <t2073>"It could have been a much worse accident.</t2073><t2074>"</t2074>
<t2075>"I don't know how it would be," cried Marianne, "unless it was under completely different circumstances.</t2075> <t2076>But it is the usual way to increase this fear when there is actually nothing to be afraid of.</t2076><t2077>"</t2077>
<t2078>"What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said Lucy Steele.</t2078>
<t2079>Marianne remained silent; even if the situation was insignificant, it was impossible for her to say something she didn't feel; therefore, all the lying for the sake of politeness fell to Elinor.</t2079> <t2080>It was needed again, and she did her best, and although she didn't go as far as Miss Lucy, she praised Lady Middleton more warmly than she felt.</t2080>
<t2081>"And Sir John," cried the eldest daughter, "what a nice man he is!</t2081><t2082>"</t2082>
<t2083>Here too, Miss Dashwood's praise came purely and fairly, without any hypocrisy.</t2083> <t2084>She contented herself with saying that she was very well-intentioned and friendly.</t2084>
<t2085>"And what a lovely family they have!</t2085> <t2086>I have never seen such sweet children in my life.</t2086> <t2087>-I can already say that I am enamored with them; in fact, I have always been incredibly fond of children.</t2087><t2088>"</t2088>
<t2089>"It must be so," said Elinor, smiling, "judging by what I saw this morning."</t2089><t2090>"</t2090>
<t2091>"I suppose," said Lucy, "you find the little Middletons too spoiled; they might be a bit out of the ordinary, but it's very natural for Lady Middleton; for my part, I love to see children full of life and joy; if they are docile and quiet, that's when I can't stand them.</t2091><t2092>"</t2092>
<t2093>"I must confess," said Elinor, "when I am at Barton Park, I do not despise docile and quiet children at all."</t2093><t2094>"</t2094>
<t2095>This speech was followed by a brief silence; the silence was broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very fond of talking, and she abruptly said, "Well, how do you find Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? I suppose you are sorry to have left Sussex."</t2095><t2096>"</t2096>
<t2097>Elinor, who was surprised by the peculiarity of this question or at least by the way it was asked, said she was sorry.</t2097>
<t2098>"Norland is an incredibly beautiful place, isn't it?" added Miss Steele.</t2098>
<t2099>"We heard that Sir John is extremely fond of the place," said Lucy, as if she thought an apology was needed for her sister's liberty.</t2099>
<t2100>"Everyone who sees that place will surely admire it," replied Elinor; "but we shouldn't think anyone can appreciate its beauties as much as we do.</t2100><t2101>"</t2101>
<t2102>"Well, were there quite a few flirts around you?"</t2102> <t2103>"Probably not many around these parts; personally, they are always a big plus for me."</t2103><t2104>"</t2104>
<t2105>"But why," said Lucy, looking embarrassed by her sister, "do you think there aren't as many polite young men in Devonshire as there are in Sussex?</t2105><t2106>"</t2106>
<t2107>"Oh my dear, I'm sure, I wasn't trying to say no.</t2107> <t2108>I'm sure there are plenty of flirts in Exeter; but, I mean, how many are there in Norland, how would I know; I just feared that the Miss Dashwoods might find Barton boring, you know, if there aren't as many as they are used to.</t2108> <t2109>But maybe you young ladies don't care about the young men, you might be saying it's fine if they aren't around.</t2109> <t2110>Personally, as long as they dress well and behave politely, I find them very essential.</t2110> <t2111>But I can't stand the ones who are shabby and grumpy.</t2111> <t2112>Now, there's a Mr. Rose in Exeter, a tremendously bright young man, a real flirt, he is Mr. Simpson's clerk, but if you saw him in the morning, you wouldn't want to see him again.</t2112> <t2113>-Surely your brother was quite a flirt too, Miss Dashwood, before he got married, considering how rich he is?</t2113><t2114>"</t2114>
<t2115>"Believe me," replied Elinor, "I cannot say that, because I do not fully grasp the meaning of the word.</t2115> <t2116>But I can tell you this much, if he was a philanderer before marriage, he still is because there hasn't been the slightest change in him.</t2116><t2117>"</t2117>
<t2118>"Well, people don't think married men are flirts - they have other things to do.</t2118><t2119>"</t2119>
<t2120>"My God! Mother," cried her sister, "you can't talk about anything other than men; -You will make Miss Dashwood believe that you think of nothing else."</t2120> <t2121>And to change the subject, she began to praise the house and the furniture.</t2121>
<t2122>It was enough data about Miss Steele.</t2122> <t2123>The elder sister's coarse freedom and stupidity already excluded her from favor; Elinor left the house without a desire to know them better, as she was not impressed enough by the younger sister's beauty or cunning looks to see the lack of true grace and naturalness.</t2123>
<t2124>They didn't do that, Miss Steeles.</t2124> <t2125>-They came from Exeter, equipped with an admiration to be spent on Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his relatives, and from that admiration, they allocated a not at all stingy share to their cousins, whom they said were the most beautiful, elegant, virtuous, and charming girls they had ever seen in their lives and were eager to get to know better.</t2125> <t2126>-Therefore, Elinor soon saw that their inevitable fate was to be better known; since Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles, that group was now too strong to be opposed, and such intimacy had to be submitted to; the intimacy consisted of sitting together in the same room for an hour or two almost every day.</t2126> <t2127>Sir John couldn't do more; but he didn't know that more was needed; to him, being together meant being close, and as long as the constant meeting plans were effective, he had no doubt that the parties were close friends.</t2127>
<t2128>To give credit where it's due, everything he knew or assumed about his cousins' situations, down to the most private detail</t2128>
<t2129>Miss Steele did everything she could to advance their familiarity by talking to her without reserve, -Elinor had seen them only twice when the elder congratulated her sister on coming to Barton and being fortunate enough to captivate the heart of a very dashing gentleman.</t2129>
<t2130>"It will definitely be a nice thing for him to get married at such a young age," she said, "I heard the young man is quite a flirt, and extremely handsome.</t2130> <t2131>May the same happen to you, -but maybe you already have a friend waiting in the wings.</t2131><t2132>"</t2132>
<t2133>When Sir John mentioned that he suspected Elinor of having an interest in Edward, Elinor could not expect him to be more sensitive about it than he was regarding Marianne; in fact, this was his favorite joke for both of them because it was newer and more mysterious; since Edward's visit, there hadn't been a single dinner where they didn't toast to Elinor's happiness with meaningful winks and nods that everyone would notice.</t2133> <t2134>The letter F was similarly brought up incessantly, becoming the subject of so many jokes that Elinor had long accepted it as the most humorous letter in the alphabet.</t2134>
<t2135>Now Miss Steeles, as expected, were taking full advantage of all these jokes; the jokes had aroused a curiosity in the elder one to learn the gentleman's name, in a manner that perfectly suited her tendency to intrude into family matters, often using impertinent expressions.</t2135> <t2136>But Sir John did not keep the curiosity he enjoyed creating alive for long, because saying the name would give him as much pleasure as Miss Steele would derive from hearing it.</t2136>
<t2137>"His name is Ferrars," she said in a very audible whisper; "but please don't tell anyone, because it's a big secret.</t2137><t2138>"</t2138>
<t2139>"Ferrars!" repeated Miss Steele; "So the lucky man is Mr. Ferrars, is it?</t2139> <t2140>What! Your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? A very charming man indeed; I know him well.</t2140><t2141>"</t2141>
<t2142>"How can you say that, Mom?" cried Lucy; she usually added a correction to all her sister's words.</t2142> <t2143>"Even if we saw him a couple of times at our uncle's, that doesn't mean we know him well.</t2143><t2144>"</t2144>
<t2145>Elinor listened to all this with attention and astonishment.</t2145> <t2146>"Well, who was this uncle?</t2146> <t2147>Where did he live?</t2147> <t2148>How had they met?" She very much wanted the subject to continue, even though she preferred not to participate in the conversation herself; but nothing more was said, and for the first time in her life, Elinor thought that Mrs. Jennings either lacked the curiosity to gather small pieces of information or the inclination to share them.</t2148> <t2149>Miss Steele's manner of speaking about Edward increased her curiosity; because it seemed to her that Miss Steele was somewhat malicious and gave her the impression that the lady either knew something against Edward or fancied herself to know something.</t2149> <t2150>But her curiosity was in vain, for even when Sir John hinted at or even openly mentioned it, Miss Steele paid no further attention to Mr. Ferrars' name.</t2150>
<t2151>Marianne, who had little tolerance for any arrogance, rudeness, stupidity, or even tastes different from her own, was already in such a low mood at that time that she could neither like the Miss Steeles nor encourage their advances; Elinor soon attributed the preference shown towards herself, which emerged in the attitudes of both, but especially Lucy, who never missed an opportunity to engage her in conversation or advance their acquaintance through easy and sincere expression of feelings, to Marianne's unchanging coldness that thwarted all efforts at friendliness.</t2151>
<t2152>Lucy had a natural intelligence; her words were often correct and entertaining; as a half-hour companion, Elinor frequently found her charming; but her abilities had not benefited from education; she was ignorant and uneducated; all the lack of mental development, the ignorance in the most ordinary matters, despite her constant effort to appear different, did not escape Miss Dashwood's notice.</t2152> <t2153>Elinor saw the neglected talents that education could have made respectable and pitied her for it; but with a less affectionate feeling, she also saw the great lack of grace, honesty, and sincerity revealed by the interest, zeal, and compliments displayed in the Park; she could not feel long-term satisfaction in the company of someone who combined hypocrisy with ignorance; her lack of education made it impossible for them to converse on equal terms-</t2153>
<t2154>it prevented others' behaviors towards him from making any sign of interest and respect in his behavior towards them seem utterly worthless.</t2154>
<t2155>"You will find my question strange, I'm afraid," said Lucy one day, as they were walking from the Park to the cottage, "but, do you personally know your aunt's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?</t2155><t2156>"</t2156>
<t2157>Elinor found the question really unnecessary and her face showed it as she said that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.</t2157>
<t2158>"Really!" replied Lucy; "I'm surprised, because I thought you had seen her several times at Norland.</t2158> <t2159>So, you can't tell me what kind of woman she is?</t2159><t2160>"</t2160>
<t2161>"No;" replied Elinor, cautiously refraining from revealing her true opinion about Edward's mother, and feeling no desire to satisfy what she considered an impertinent curiosity -"I know nothing about her.</t2161><t2162>"</t2162>
<t2163>"I'm sure you find me very strange for questioning him in such a manner," said Lucy, carefully observing Elinor; "but perhaps there are reasons - I wish I could dare; but anyhow, I hope you will believe that I do not wish to be impudent.</t2163><t2164>"</t2164>
<t2165>Elinor gave her a polite answer and they walked in silence for a few minutes.</t2165> <t2166>Lucy broke the silence, reopening the subject with a certain hesitation by saying,</t2166>
<t2167>"I cannot bear you finding me indiscreetly curious.</t2167> <t2168>I am sure I would do anything rather than be thought so by someone whose opinion I value as much as yours.</t2168> <t2169>I am sure I should have no fear in trusting you; indeed, I would be happy to receive your advice on how to act in such an uncomfortable situation; but there is no reason to bother you.</t2169> <t2170>I am sorry you do not know Mrs. Ferrars.</t2170><t2171>"</t2171>
<t2172>"I am also sorry that I did not know," said Elinor with great astonishment, "since it seems my opinion could have been useful to you.</t2172> <t2173>But truly, I did not understand what kind of relationship you have with that family, so I must confess I was a bit surprised when faced with such a serious question about his character.</t2173><t2174>"</t2174>
<t2175>"I guess so, believe me, I wasn't surprised by this.</t2175> <t2176>But if I could dare to tell you everything, you wouldn't be so surprised.</t2176> <t2177>Mrs. Ferrars is, of course, nothing to me at the moment, -but if the time comes -when it comes depends on her -we could have a very close relationship.</t2177><t2178>"</t2178>
<t2179>While saying this, she lowered her head, in a charming shyness, she only cast a brief sideways glance at her travel companion to see the effect of her words.</t2179>
<t2180>"For God's sake!" cried Elinor, "what do you mean?</t2180> <t2181>Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?</t2181> <t2182>Is it possible?" And she did not like the idea of such a sister-in-law at all.</t2182>
<t2183>"No;" replied Lucy, "Not Mr. Robert Ferrars - I have never seen him in my life; but," fixing her eyes on Elinor, "I mean his brother.</t2183><t2184>"</t2184>
<t2185>What did Elinor feel at that moment?</t2185> <t2186>Amazement; this would have been as powerful as it was painful if disbelief had not accompanied it at that moment.</t2186> <t2187>She turned to Lucy in silent astonishment, unable to guess the reason or target of such a statement, her facial expression constantly changing, yet she was firmly skeptical and not in danger of a hysterical fit or fainting.</t2187>
<t2188>"You are right to be surprised," continued Lucy; "because of course you could not have heard it before; because I am afraid he did not hint at it to you or your family in the slightest; because it was always meant to remain a great secret and I have faithfully kept it as such until this hour.</t2188> <t2189>Not a single one of my relatives, except my mother, knows; if I did not trust your confidentiality, I would never have told you; I truly thought that my asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars might seem strange and require an explanation.</t2189> <t2190>I do not think Mr. Ferrars will be upset when he learns that I have trusted you, because he holds your entire family in high regard and considers you, and the other Miss Dashwoods, as his own sisters." -She paused.</t2190>
<t2191>Elinor was silent for a while.</t2191> <t2192>Her astonishment at what she had heard was initially too great to be expressed; but at last, forcing herself to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said with a composure that fairly concealed her surprise and concern, "May I ask, have you been engaged for long?"</t2192><t2193>"</t2193>
<t2194>"We have been engaged for four years.</t2194><t2195>"</t2195>
<t2196>"Four years!"</t2196><t2197>"</t2197>
<t2198>"Yes.</t2198><t2199>"</t2199>
<t2200>Although Elinor was extremely shaken, she still couldn't believe it.</t2200>
<t2201>"I didn't even know you had met," he said, "until the other day"</t2201>
<t2202>"However, our acquaintance goes back many years. For a long time, you know, he remained under my uncle's supervision."</t2202><t2203>"</t2203>
<t2204>"Your uncle's!</t2204><t2205>"</t2205>
<t2206>"Yes; Mr. Pratt.</t2206> <t2207>Have you ever heard him mention Mr. Pratt?</t2207><t2208>"</t2208>
<t2209>"I think I heard," replied Elinor, forcing herself; the more intense her emotions became, the more she had to force herself.</t2209>
<t2210>"He stayed with my uncle for four years; he lives in Longstaple near Plymouth.</t2210> <t2211>Our acquaintance began there because my sister and I often stayed with my uncle; we got engaged there, but of course, a year after he finished his studies; after that, he was almost always with us.</t2211> <t2212>As you can imagine, I never wanted to get engaged without his mother's knowledge and approval; but I was very young and loved him too much to act sensibly.</t2212> <t2213>-Even if you don't know him as well as I do, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to guess that he could sincerely make a woman fall in love with him.</t2213><t2214>"</t2214>
<t2215>"Of course," replied Elinor, without knowing what she was saying; but after a moment's thought, her belief in Edward's honor and love, and her renewed conviction of the companion's deceit, she added these words: "You are engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!</t2215> <t2216>-I confess I am extremely surprised by what you have told me, I mean really -I beg your pardon; but there must be some mistake about the person or the name.</t2216> <t2217>We cannot be referring to the same Mr. Ferrars.</t2217><t2218>"</t2218>
<t2219>"We cannot be referring to anyone else," cried Lucy with a smile.</t2219> <t2220>"The person I mean is Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars of Park Street and the brother of your sister-in-law Mrs. John Dashwood; you must admit that there is no possibility of my being mistaken about the man on whom all my happiness depends.</t2220><t2221>"</t2221>
<t2222>"Strange," replied Elinor in a pained astonishment, "I have never heard your name mentioned."</t2222><t2223>"</t2223>
<t2224>"Of course; considering our situation, it's not strange.</t2224> <t2225>Our first concern was to keep the matter secret.</t2225> <t2226>You haven't heard from me or my family, so there was no reason to tell you my name because he was afraid his sister would suspect something, which was enough reason not to mention my name.</t2226><t2227>"</t2227>
<t2228>She fell silent.</t2228> <t2229>Elinor's faith collapsed; but her self-control did not collapse along with it.</t2229>
<t2230>"You have been engaged for four years," he said in a firm voice.</t2230>
<t2231>"Yes; God knows how much longer we will have to wait.</t2231> <t2232>Poor Edward! This situation is really bothering him."</t2232> <t2233>Then, taking a small miniature out of his pocket, he added, "To avoid the possibility of a mistake, please take a good look at this face.</t2233> <t2234>It doesn't do him justice, of course, but I think you won't be mistaken about the person it depicts.</t2234> <t2235>-I've been carrying this with me for three years.</t2235><t2236>"</t2236>
<t2237>While speaking, she placed the portrait in her hands; when Elinor saw the portrait, no matter what other doubts she might have had in her mind about making a hasty decision or wishing to find a lie, she could not deny that this was Edward's face.</t2237> <t2238>She immediately returned the portrait, accepting the resemblance.</t2238>
<t2239>"In return," continued Lucy, "I couldn't give him my picture, which makes me very sad because he always wanted it so much!</t2239> <t2240>But I am determined to have a picture made at the first opportunity.</t2240> <t2241>"</t2241>
<t2242>"It would be good," Elinor replied calmly.</t2242> <t2243>Then they walked a few steps in silence.</t2243> <t2244>Lucy spoke first.</t2244>
<t2245>"Indeed," he said, "I have no doubt that you will carefully keep this secret, because you must know its importance to us; his mother must not hear it, for she would never approve.</t2245> <t2246>I have no fortune; I think she is also an exceedingly proud woman.</t2246><t2247>"</t2247>
<t2248>"I certainly did not try to be your confidante," said Elinor; "but if you think you can trust me, at least you would not be doing me an injustice.</t2248> <t2249>Your secret is safe with me; but please excuse me if I express that I am a little surprised by such an unnecessary conversation.</t2249> <t2250>You must have felt that my knowing it would not at least increase the security of the secret.</t2250><t2251>"</t2251>
<t2252>While saying these things, he looked at Lucy with curiosity, hoping to discover something on her face; perhaps most of what he was saying was a lie; but there was no change in Lucy's face.</t2252>
<t2253>"I was afraid you would think I was being too forward by telling you all this," she said. "Of course, I haven't known you for long, at least not personally, but I have known you and your family by reputation for a long time; the moment I saw you, I felt as if you were an old friend.</t2253><t2254>Moreover, in this situation, after asking detailed questions about Edward's mother, I felt I owed you an explanation; I am so unfortunate that I have no one to consult.</t2254><t2255>My mother is the only person who knows the situation, but she is not very sharp; in fact, she does me more harm than good because I am always afraid she will give me away.</t2255><t2256>You must have seen, she doesn't know how to hold her tongue; that's why the other day when Sir John mentioned Edward's name, I was dying of fear that she would slip up.</t2256><t2257>You can't imagine what goes on inside me because of this.</t2257><t2258>After all the things I've endured for Edward's sake over these four years, I can't help but be amazed that I'm still alive.</t2258><t2259>Everything is so up in the air, so uncertain; and then seeing him so little - we can meet at most twice a year.</t2259><t2260>I am astonished that my heart hasn't shattered yet.</t2260><t2261>"</t2261>
<t2262>He took out his handkerchief here; but Elinor did not feel much pity.</t2262>
<t2263>"Sometimes," continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, "I wonder if it wouldn't be better for both of us to end the matter completely."</t2263> <t2264>As she said this, she looked directly at her companion.</t2264> <t2265>"But at other times, I can't show that determination.</t2265> <t2266>-I can't bear the thought of upsetting him so much, knowing how devastated he would be even at the mention of such a thing.</t2266> <t2267>For my part - because he is so precious to me, I don't think I could bear it either.</t2267> <t2268>In this situation, what would you advise me to do, Miss Dashwood? What would you do?</t2268><t2269>"</t2269>
<t2270>"Forgive me," replied Elinor, startled by the question; "but under these circumstances, I cannot advise you.</t2270> <t2271>Your own feelings should guide you.</t2271><t2272>"</t2272>
<t2273>"Of course," continued Lucy, after both sides had remained silent for a few minutes, "his mother has to take care of him for a while longer; but poor Edward is so upset because of this!</t2273> <t2274>Didn't you find him terribly unhappy when he was in Barton?</t2274> <t2275>When he left us to come to you in Longstaple, he was so distraught that I was afraid you would think he was ill.</t2275><t2276>"</t2276>
<t2277>"When he visited us, did he come from your uncle?</t2277><t2278>"</t2278>
<t2279>"Oh yes; he stayed with us for fifteen days.</t2279> <t2280>Did you think he came from the city?</t2280><t2281>"</t2281>
<t2282>"No," replied Elinor, being very sensitive to any new information that might be in favor of Lucy's honesty; "I remember her telling us that she has been staying with some friends near Plymouth for the past fifteen days.</t2282><t2283>"</t2283> <t2284>She also recalled being surprised that she did not mention her friends more and her absolute silence regarding their names.</t2284>
<t2285>"Didn't you find him very joyless?" repeated Lucy.</t2285>
<t2286>"Of course we found it, especially when he first arrived."</t2286><t2287>"</t2287>
<t2288>"I asked him to force himself so that you wouldn't suspect anything; but not being able to stay with us for more than fifteen days and seeing me so affected was upsetting him greatly.</t2288> <t2289>-Poor thing!</t2289> <t2290>-I'm afraid he is still in that state now; because he writes in a miserable state of mind.</t2290> <t2291>I heard from him just before leaving Exeter."</t2291> <t2292>He took a letter out of his pocket and carelessly showed the address to Elinor.</t2292> <t2293>"I believe you recognize his handwriting, he has a beautiful script; but this one is not as beautifully written as usual.</t2293> <t2294>-He must have been tired, because he would fill the page as much as possible for me.</t2294><t2295>"</t2295>
<t2296>Elinor saw that the writing was in his handwriting and could no longer doubt it.</t2296> <t2297>She had accepted that the picture might have been obtained accidentally; it didn't have to be a gift from Edward; but correspondence between them could only be possible under a positive agreement, otherwise it would be unacceptable; for a few seconds, she felt like she was going to collapse - her heart sank within her, and she could barely stand, but forcing herself was inevitably necessary, she fought against the pressure of her emotions with such determination that her success was swift and, for now, complete.</t2297>
<t2298>"Corresponding by letters," said Lucy, putting the letter back into her pocket, "is our only solace during such long separations.</t2298> <t2299>Yes, I have another solace, his picture; but poor Edward doesn't even have that.</t2299> <t2300>He says he would be comforted if he had a picture of me.</t2300> <t2301>When he last came to Longstaple, I gave him a lock of my hair wrapped in a ring; it comforted him a bit, he said, but of course, it's not the same as a picture.</t2301> <t2302>Perhaps you noticed the ring when you saw him?</t2302><t2303>"</t2303>
<t2304>"I did," said Elinor, keeping her voice steady; beneath her voice was a feeling and distress beyond anything she had felt before.</t2304> <t2305>She felt as if she were going to die, shaken and devastated.</t2305>
<t2306>Fortunately, they had now reached the cottage, and the conversation could not be prolonged any further.</t2306> <t2307>After sitting with them for a few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then free to think and despair.</t2307>
<t2308>SECOND BOOK</t2308>
<t2309>Although she did not have much faith in Lucy's honesty, when she thought it through thoroughly, it seemed impossible to doubt her honesty in this matter; no motive could justify the effort to find a lie in such a story.</t2309> <t2310>Therefore, Elinor did not attempt to doubt what Lucy claimed to be true: it was supported by possibilities and evidence from all sides and contradicted nothing except Elinor's wishes.</t2310> <t2311>The opportunity to meet at Mr. Pratt's house formed an undeniable and alarming basis for the rest; Edward's trip around Plymouth, his melancholic mood, his insecurity about his own abilities, his indecisive behavior towards Elinor, the Miss Steeles' surprisingly detailed knowledge about Norland and their relatives, the picture, the letter, the ring all together formed such a body of evidence that it erased the fear of unjustly condemning Edward and confirmed the fact that he had deceived Elinor, a truth that no effort to protect could conceal.</t2311> <t2312>Elinor's resentment in the face of this behavior, the anger she felt at being deceived, led her to think only of herself for a short time; but soon other thoughts, other concerns emerged.</t2312> <t2313>Was Edward deceiving her knowingly?</t2313> <t2314>Was he pretending to love her while he did not?</t2314> <t2315>Was the promise he made to Lucy a heartfelt one?</t2315>
<t2316>Was it?</t2316> <t2317>No; whatever might have happened in the past, Elinor could not now believe that such a word could exist.</t2317> <t2318>His love belonged to Elinor.</t2318> <t2319>She could not be mistaken about this.</t2319> <t2320>Her mother, her sisters, Fanny, they had all felt his closeness to Elinor at Norland; this was not an illusion created by her own vanity.</t2320> <t2321>It was clear that he loved her.</t2321> <t2322>How much peace this belief brought to her heart!</t2322> <t2323>Could it be possible that this did not make her forgive him!</t2323> <t2324>Edward was guilty, quite guilty for staying at Norland even after he first felt that Elinor had too much influence over him.</t2324> <t2325>In this respect, he was indefensible; but if Edward had hurt her, he must have hurt himself much more; if Elinor's situation was pitiable, his was utterly hopeless.</t2325> <t2326>His lack of judgment had made Elinor unhappy for a while; but it seemed to have deprived him of all other possibilities.</t2326> <t2327>Elinor might regain her composure over time; but what could he expect?</t2327> <t2328>Could he be more or less happy with Lucy Steele; even if his love for Elinor were not in question, could he, as a moral, sensitive, and educated person, be content with such a woman - an illiterate, deceitful, and selfish woman?</t2328>
<t2329>The passion of youth at nineteen had naturally blinded him to everything except the girl's beauty and docility; but the following four years—years that, if spent wisely, would have strengthened his understanding—should have opened his eyes to the flaws in the girl's education; on the other hand, the girl had likely lost the simplicity that once might have given her beauty an intriguing character by spending the same period in a lower environment and pursuing more superficial interests.</t2329>
<t2330>If the difficulties that Edward's mother would raise in the event of his wanting to marry Elinor seemed great, now that his fiancée was undoubtedly from a family of lower status than Elinor's and presumably with a smaller dowry, these difficulties would obviously be much greater.</t2330> <t2331>These difficulties might not strain Edward's patience too much, given his heart had grown so cold towards Lucy; but the expectation of family opposition and lack of understanding could have a refreshing effect on his sorrowful state of mind!</t2331>
<t2332>While these thoughts passed through his mind in a painful continuity, he cried more for her than for himself.</t2332> <t2333>Strengthened by the belief that he had done nothing to deserve his current unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edvvard had done nothing to forgo her love, he now felt that he could control himself enough to hide every doubt about the truth from his mother and sisters, even under the initial pain of the heavy blow.</t2333> <t2334>He managed to meet his own expectations so well that when he joined them for dinner just two hours after enduring the complete extinguishment of his most private hopes, no one could have guessed from the sight of the sisters that Elinor was secretly mourning the barriers that forever separated her from her love, and that Marianne, who felt she possessed his whole heart, was inwardly dreaming about the superior qualities of a man she expected to see in every carriage passing near their home.</t2334>
<t2335>Although the necessity of keeping something entrusted to her own confidentiality from her mother and Marianne caused her to exert continuous effort, it did not increase Elinor's sorrow.</t2335> <t2336>On the contrary, it relieved her, as it prevented her from giving them information that would upset them; moreover, from their excessive partiality towards her, they would probably have scolded Edward a lot, which she did not have to hear, and she did not think she could have endured it anyway.</t2336>
<t2337>He knew that he could not get any help from their advice or conversations; their affection and sorrow would only increase his distress; moreover, his calmness would not be encouraged by either their example or their praise.</t2337> <t2338>He was stronger on his own; his own common sense kept him so well that the more intense and fresh his pains were, the more unshakable his determination and the more unchanging his cheerful appearance.</t2338>
<t2339>Although she had suffered greatly during her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt a strong desire to repeat the conversation, and for more than one reason.</t2339> <t2340>She wanted to hear again many details of their engagement, to better understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there was any sincerity in her declaration of love for him, and particularly to convince Lucy, through her willingness to re-enter the subject and her ease in discussing it, that she was only interested in the matter as a friend, because she feared greatly that her involuntary agitation during the morning conversation had appeared at least suspicious.</t2340> <t2341>It seemed very likely that Lucy was inclined to be jealous of her; it was clear that Edward had spoken highly of her, not only from what Lucy had said, but also because he had dared to trust her with a secret that seemed quite important given their short acquaintance.</t2341> <t2342>Even Sir John's playful remarks must have had an effect.</t2342> <t2343>But as long as Elinor was confident within herself that Edward truly loved her, she did not need to consider any other possibility that would naturally make Lucy jealous; the proof of this was that he had revealed his secret to her.</t2343> <t2344>What other reason could there be for the disclosure of the matter, other than to inform Elinor that Lucy had a greater claim on Edward and to ask her to keep her distance from him in the future?</t2344> <t2345>She had no difficulty in understanding so much of her rival's intentions; although she had decided to act towards her as honor and principles of honesty dictated, to struggle with her feelings for Edward, and to see him as little as possible, she did not consider it too much to attempt to convince Lucy that her heart was unscathed.</t2345> <t2346>And now, since she could not hear anything more painful than what had already been said on the subject, she did not doubt her ability to maintain her composure while going over the details again.</t2346>
<t2347>But this opportunity was not immediately created, even though Lucy was as eager for it as he was; the weather was generally not good enough to allow them to separate from others and go for a walk together; even though they gathered at least every other evening either in the Park or in the club, mostly in the Park, it was not expected for them to come together for the sake of conversation.</t2347> <t2348>Such a thought would not occur to either Sir John or Lady Middleton; therefore, very little time was allocated to general conversation, and no time at all to private conversation.</t2348> <t2349>They gathered for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing cards or storytelling or some other sufficiently noisy game.</t2349>
<t2350>There had been one or two such meetings, but they did not give Elinor the opportunity to pull Lucy aside; Sir John called at the cottage one morning and, as he had to go to the cottage in Exeter, he requested, in the name of humanity, that they dine together with Lady Middleton that evening, otherwise he would be completely alone, except for his mother and the two Miss Steeles.</t2350> <t2351>Seeing an opportunity to implement her plan in an environment where they could be more at ease under Lady Middleton's calm and courteous management, as opposed to when her husband brought them together for noisy purposes, Elinor immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret promptly followed suit with her mother's permission, and Marianne, who was always reluctant to join their parties, was persuaded to go by her mother, who could not bear to see her deprive herself of every chance of enjoyment.</t2351>
<t2352>The young ladies left, and Lady Middleton was sweetly spared from the terrifying loneliness that threatened her.</t2352> <t2353>The dullness of the gathering was exactly as Elinor had expected; it produced no new thought or expression; nothing could be less interesting than their conversations in the dining room and the sitting room: the children also accompanied them to the sitting room; as long as they stayed there, Elinor knew well that it would be impossible to attract Lucy's attention, so she didn't even attempt it.</t2353> <t2354>The children only left the room after the tea service was cleared away.</t2354> <t2355>Then, when the card table was brought in, Elinor began to marvel to herself, hoping for an opportunity to speak at the Park.</t2355> <t2356>They all rose to play cards.</t2356>
<t2357>"I'm glad you won't be finishing Annamaria's basket this evening," said Lady Middleton to Lucy; "because I'm sure working on filigree by candlelight would harm your eyes.</t2357> <t2358>Our little darling will be disappointed tomorrow, but we'll make it up to her; then I hope she won't dwell on it.</t2358><t2359>"</t2359>
<t2360>The signal was enough; Lucy immediately gathered herself and responded, "You are really mistaken, Lady Middleton; I was just waiting to find out if you could form the group without me, otherwise I should have already been at my filigree work.</t2360> <t2361>I do not want to disappoint the little angel in the world; even if you want me at the game table now, I am determined to finish the basket after dinner.</t2361><t2362>"</t2362>
<t2363>"You are very good, I hope it doesn't hurt your eyes - would you like to ring the bell and ask for some work wax?</t2363> <t2364>If the basket is not finished by tomorrow, my little girl will be very upset because even though I told her it was impossible to finish, I am sure she is still waiting for it to be done.</t2364><t2365>"</t2365>
<t2366>Lucy pulled her work desk close and started working with enthusiasm and joy, as if there could be no greater pleasure than making a filigree basket for a spoiled child.</t2366>
<t2367>Lady Middleton suggested to the others to play cassino.</t2367> <t2368>The only one who objected was Marianne; with her usual disregard for general politeness, she said, "Please forgive me, Lady - you know I hate cards.</t2368> <t2369>I will go to the piano; I haven't touched it since it was tuned."</t2369> <t2370>And without waiting for any further ceremony, she turned and went to the piano.</t2370>
<t2371>Lady Middleton seemed to be thanking God that she had never spoken so rudely in her life.</t2371>
<t2372>"You know, Madam, Marianne cannot stay away from the piano for long," said Elinor, trying to soften the insult; "I am not really surprised, because this is the best-sounding piano I have ever heard."</t2372><t2373>"</t2373>
<t2374>The remaining five people were now going to draw their cards.</t2374>
<t2375>"Maybe," continued Elinor, "if I go out, I can help Miss Lucy Steele fold the papers; the basket still has a lot of work, and it seems she won't be able to finish it this evening if left alone.</t2375> <t2376>If she allows me to share, I would love to do the work.</t2376><t2377>"</t2377>
<t2378>"I would be truly grateful if you could help," cried Lucy, "because I have realized there is more work than I thought; also, disappointing Annamaria would be a terrible thing.</t2378><t2379>"</t2379>
<t2380>"Yes, that would be really terrible," said Miss Steele - "My little darling, how much I love him!</t2380><t2381>"</t2381>
<t2382>"You are very kind," said Lady Middleton to Elinor: "if you really enjoy embroidery, perhaps you would be pleased not to join the game until the next round, or would you prefer to try your luck?</t2382><t2383>"</t2383>
<t2384>Elinor gladly accepted the first of these offers, thus achieving her aim in a manner that Marianne would not deign to attempt, and pleasing Lady Middleton in the process.</t2384> <t2385>Lucy quickly made room for her, and the two lovely rivals thus sat side by side at the same table, embarking on the same task with remarkable harmony.</t2385> <t2386>So engrossed was Marianne in her own music and thoughts that she had forgotten anyone else was in the room, and the piano she played was so close that Miss Dashwood decided she could now broach that intriguing subject without the risk of being overheard from the card table, shielded by the sound of the piano.</t2386>
<t2387>Elinor began the topic in a calm but cautious voice.</t2387>
<t2388>"If I don't want you to continue or if I don't show more interest in the subject, I wouldn't deserve the trust you've shown me.</t2388> <t2389>So I won't apologize for bringing up the subject again.</t2389><t2390>"</t2390>
<t2391>"Thank you," cried Lucy fervently, "for breaking the ice; you have put my mind at ease because I was afraid that I had somehow offended you with what I said on that Monday.</t2391><t2392>"</t2392>
<t2393>"Offend you!</t2393> <t2394>How could you think such a thing?</t2394> <t2395>Believe me," and Elinor said this with genuine sincerity, "the thought of giving you such an impression never even crossed my mind.</t2395> <t2396>Could there be a reason for your trust that is not filled with sincerity and compliment?</t2396><t2397>"</t2397>
<t2398>"Nevertheless, I assure you," replied Lucy, her small sharp eyes full of meaning, "it seemed to me that there was a coldness and dissatisfaction in your behavior that disturbed me.</t2398> <t2399>I was sure you were angry with me; since then, I have been fighting with myself for the audacity of burdening you with my own troubles.</t2399> <t2400>But I am glad to see that it was only my imagination.</t2400> <t2401>If you knew how much of a consolation it is for me to relieve myself by telling you what I think at every moment of my life, I am sure your sense of compassion would make you overlook everything else.</t2401><t2402>"</t2402>
<t2403>"Of course, I believe that telling me about your situation has relieved you; rest assured that you will not regret this</t2403>
<t2404>there is no reason at all.</t2404> <t2405>Your situation is a great misfortune; your surroundings seem full of difficulties; you will need all your love for each other to endure them.</t2405> <t2406>Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother.</t2406><t2407>"</t2407>
<t2408>"He has only two thousand pounds; it would be madness to rely on that and get married; although personally, I would give up everything without a second thought.</t2408> <t2409>I am used to living on a tight budget; I can struggle with poverty for his sake; but I love him too much to be selfish enough to deprive him of everything he could have by making a marriage that would please his mother.</t2409> <t2410>We have to wait, maybe for years.</t2410> <t2411>With any other man in the world, this would be a terrifying thought; but I know, nothing can deprive me of Edward's love and loyalty.</t2411><t2412>"</t2412>
<t2413>"This belief must be very important to you; it should also stand firm with the confidence it has in your loyalty.</t2413> <t2414>If the strength of your mutual commitment were to diminish, which naturally would happen among many people and in many situations over a four-year engagement, your situation would indeed be pitiable.</t2414><t2415>"</t2415>
<t2416>Here, Lucy lifted her head and looked at her; but Elinor carefully kept her face free from any expression that might give her words a doubtful air.</t2416>
<t2417>"Edward's love for me," said Lucy, "has been tested quite a lot by our long, very long separation since we first got engaged, and it has endured the test so well that now it would be unforgivable for me to doubt it.</t2417> <t2418>From the very beginning, I can proudly say that in that regard, he hasn't given me the slightest fear.</t2418><t2419>"</t2419>
<t2420>Elinor didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this claim.</t2420>
<t2421>Lucy continued.</t2421> <t2422>"Moreover, by nature, I am jealous; the different positions we hold in life, the fact that he has seen more of the world than I have, and our constant separations already made me inclined to be suspicious, and if when we met there was the slightest change in his behavior towards me or the smallest unease in his demeanor that I could not explain, or if he talked about one lady more than another, or seemed less happy in Longstaple than before, I would instantly notice the truth.</t2422> <t2423>Generally speaking, I do not claim to be particularly observant or quick-witted, but in such a situation, it would be impossible for me to be mistaken.</t2423><t2424>"</t2424>
<t2425>"All this," thought Elinor, "is quite nice; but it cannot affect either of us."</t2425><t2426>"</t2426>
<t2427>"But," he said after a short silence, "what are your thoughts? Or do you have no other thoughts than to wait for Mrs. Ferrars' death, which is also sad and a last resort?</t2427> <t2428>Is your son determined to endure the hardship of waiting all these years, of which you are also a part, rather than risk his mother's anger by telling the truth for a while?</t2428><t2429>"</t2429>
<t2430>"If only we could be sure it would only be for a while!"</t2430> <t2431>Mrs. Ferrars is a very stubborn and proud woman; in the fit of anger she will likely experience the moment she hears, she would probably transfer everything to Robert; this thought, of course, frightens me even more about taking urgent precautions for Edward."</t2431><t2432>"</t2432>
<t2433>"But for your own sake as well, otherwise you would be taking your sacrifice to an intellectually unacceptable point."</t2433><t2434>"</t2434>
<t2435>Lucy looked at Elinor again and fell silent.</t2435>
<t2436>"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Eli-</t2436>
<t2437>north.</t2437>
<t2438>"I don't know him at all -I've never seen him; but I think he doesn't resemble his brother at all -a fool and a big dandy."</t2438><t2439>"</t2439>
<t2440>"A big snob!" repeated Miss Steele; these words reached Marianne's ears when there was a sudden pause in her music.</t2440> <t2441>"Well, they are talking about the boys they like, I suppose.</t2441><t2442>"</t2442>
<t2443>"No, sister," cried Lucy, "you are wrong about that; the boys we like don't turn into big snobs.</t2443><t2444>"</t2444>
<t2445>"On behalf of Miss Dashwood, I can also say no," said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; "hers is one of the most modest and pleasant-mannered young men I have ever seen; but as for Lucy, she is such a cunning rascal that it is impossible to understand whom she likes.</t2445><t2446>"</t2446>
<t2447>"Aa!" cried Miss Steele, looking meaningfully at those around her, "I think Lucy's manners are just as humble and pleasant as Miss Dashwood's.</t2447><t2448>"</t2448>
<t2449>Elinor couldn't prevent her face from reddening.</t2449> <t2450>Lucy bit her lip and looked at her sister angrily.</t2450> <t2451>Everyone was silent for a while.</t2451> <t2452>Lucy broke the silence; at that moment, Marianne was providing them with strong cover through a magnificent concerto, and lowering her voice, she said-</t2452>
<t2453>"I will openly explain to you a plan that recently came to my mind to make the situation more bearable; of course, I will be sharing a secret with you, because you are also one of the parties involved.</t2453> <t2454>I assume you have gotten to know Edward well enough to know that he holds the church above all other professions; now my plan is this, Edward will soon receive his priestly authority, and then with your help, which I am sure you will not withhold due to your friendship with him and hopefully your understanding towards me, your brother can be persuaded to give him the church in Norland; which, as I understand, is a very good position, and the current incumbent does not seem to have long to live.</t2454> <t2455>This will be enough for us to marry; we will leave the rest to time and fate.</t2455><t2456>"</t2456>
<t2457>"I will always be happy," replied Elinor, "to show the respect and friendship I feel for Mr. Ferrars; but don't you know that my assistance would be completely unnecessary in such a situation?</t2457> <t2458>He is Mrs. John Dashwood's brother - and that is recommendation enough for her husband.</t2458><t2459>"</t2459>
<t2460>"But Mrs. John Dashwood does not quite approve of Edward entering the church."</t2460><t2461>"</t2461>
<t2462>"In that case, I'm afraid my help won't be of much use."</t2462><t2463>"</t2463>
<t2464>They remained silent for a while again.</t2464> <t2465>Finally, Lucy sighed deeply and said,</t2465>
<t2466>"Perhaps the wisest thing is to break off the engagement and end it.</t2466> <t2467>We are surrounded by so many obstacles that, although we may suffer for a while, we will ultimately be happier.</t2467> <t2468>But won't you give me some advice, Miss Dashwood?</t2468><t2469>"</t2469>
<t2470>"No;" Elinor replied with a smile that concealed her rising emotions, "I definitely cannot give it on such a matter.</t2470> <t2471>You know very well that if my opinion does not align with your wishes, it will not influence you.</t2471><t2472>"</t2472>
<t2473>"You are mistaken about me," replied Lucy with great solemnity; "there is no one whose opinions I value more than yours; I truly believe that if you were to say to me, 'I advise you to end your engagement with Edward Ferrars no matter what, it would be better for both of your happiness,' I would immediately decide to do so.</t2473><t2474>"</t2474>
<t2475>Elinor blushed at the sincerity of Edward's future wife and replied, "Even if I had an opinion on the matter after such a compliment, I would be afraid to express it.</t2475> <t2476>You overestimate my influence; the power to separate two people so lovingly attached is too much for an unrelated person.</t2476><t2477>"</t2477>
<t2478>"Because you are an irrelevant person," said Lucy, with a certain anger, emphasizing the words, "that's why your opinion might affect me.</t2478> <t2479>If there were anything to suggest that your feelings were biased in any way, it wouldn't be worth getting your opinions anyway.</t2479><t2480>"</t2480>
<t2481>Elinor thought it would be wiser not to respond, so as not to provoke each other into an inappropriate increase of comfort and recklessness; she even seemed to decide not to bring up the subject again.</t2481> <t2482>This conversation was followed by another silence that lasted quite a while, and it was Lucy who broke the silence again.</t2482>
<t2483>"Are you going to the city this winter, Miss Dashwood?" he said with his usual ease.</t2483>
<t2484>"I will not go."</t2484><t2485>"</t2485>
<t2486>"I am saddened by this," the other replied, his eyes gleaming with the information he had received, "meeting you there would have made me very happy!</t2486> <t2487>But maybe you will still go.</t2487> <t2488>Of course, your brother and sister-in-law would want you with them.</t2488><t2489>"</t2489>
<t2490>"even if they wanted to, it wouldn't be possible for me to accept their invitation."</t2490><t2491>"</t2491>
<t2492>"What bad luck!</t2492> <t2493>I was quite confident that I would meet you there.</t2493> <t2494>At the end of January, Anne and I will visit some relatives who have been wanting us to visit them for a few years!</t2494> <t2495>But I am only going for the sake of seeing Edward.</t2495> <t2496>He will be there in February, otherwise London has no charm for me; it doesn't suit my soul at all.</t2496><t2497>"</t2497>
<t2498>With the completion of the first round, Elinor was soon called to the game table, and thus the secret conversation between the two ladies came to an end; both accepted this situation without objection, as nothing had been said to reduce the coldness between them compared to before; Elinor sat at the card table in sorrow, with the belief that not only did she not love the person who would be Edward's wife, but also that she would have little chance of being somewhat happy when she married him; that much happiness would be given by the woman's sincere love, but only self-interest could persuade a woman to remain engaged to a man she was fully aware had grown tired of her.</t2498>
<t2499>After this, the subject was never brought up again by Elinor; and when it was brought up by Lucy, who never missed an opportunity to speak and took special care to inform her confidante how happy she was with each letter she received from Edward, Elinor remained calm and cautious and closed the topic as soon as politeness allowed; because she thought these conversations were an intimacy that Lucy did not deserve and were dangerous for herself.</t2499>
<t2500>Miss Steele's stay at Barton Park lasted much longer than the initial invitation had anticipated.</t2500> <t2501>Their reputation grew, they became indispensable; Sir John did not even want them to talk about leaving; despite having many long-standing commitments in Exeter and the necessity to return immediately every weekend to keep their promises, they were persuaded to stay at Barton Park for nearly two months and to help with those festival celebrations that required quite a number of special balls and feasts to deserve their importance.</t2501>
<t2502>Mrs. Jennings had the habit of spending most of the year at the homes of her children and friends, but she did have her own well-furnished house as well.</t2502> <t2503>Since the death of her husband, who had successfully engaged in trade in the less genteel part of the city, she had stayed every winter in a house on one of the streets near Portman Square.</t2503> <t2504>As January approached, she began to turn her thoughts towards this house and one day, quite unexpectedly and without any prior consideration, she invited the elder Miss Dashwoods to accompany her there.</t2504> <t2505>Without noticing her sister's changing expression and the lively glances that showed she was not indifferent to the plan, Elinor immediately gave a grateful but firm refusal on behalf of both of them; at that moment, she believed she was expressing their mutual inclination.</t2505> <t2506>The reason given was their determination not to leave their mother alone at that time of year.</t2506> <t2507>Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise and immediately reiterated her invitation.</t2507>
<t2508>"Oh, I'm sure your mother can manage without you; besides, I insist that you do not withhold your friendship from me, because I want it very much.</t2508> <t2509>Don't think that you will be a bother to me, because I am not going to make any changes in my life for you.</t2509> <t2510>I will just send Betty with the stagecoach, I hope she can endure that much.</t2510> <t2511>The three of us will comfortably go in my carriage; when we go to the city, if you do not want to go to the places I go, you can always go with one of my daughters.</t2511>
<t2512>Sure.</t2512> <t2513>I'm sure your mother won't object to this; after all, I don't have the burden of my own children, so your mother would agree that I can take responsibility for you; if I can't manage to get at least one of you married off before I'm done with you, it wouldn't be my fault.</t2513> <t2514>I will say good things about you to all the young men, you can be sure of that.</t2514><t2515>"</t2515>
<t2516>"I have an idea," said Sir John, "if her sister is convinced, Miss Marianne will not object to such a plan.</t2516> <t2517>It's very sad that she is deprived of a small pleasure just because Miss Dashwood doesn't want it.</t2517> <t2518>So my advice to both of you is to set off for the city without saying a word to Miss Dashwood when you get bored of Barton.</t2518><t2519>"</t2519>
<t2520>"Honestly," cried Mrs. Jennings, "whether Miss Dashwood comes or not, I would be extremely pleased with Miss Marianne's company, but the more the merrier; and I thought they would be more comfortable together because if they get bored with me, they can chat with each other and gossip about me.</t2520> <t2521>But if both can't come, then one or the other must come with me.</t2521> <t2522>For God's sake! How can you think I could live alone, when I have been used to having Charlotte by my side until this winter.</t2522> <t2523>Come on, Miss Marianne, let's shake hands and agree; and if Miss Dashwood changes her mind in the meantime, all the better.</t2523><t2524>"</t2524>
<t2525>"Thank you, sir, truly thank you," said Marianne, in a warm voice; "I will be eternally grateful for your invitation; it would give me great happiness, yes, even the greatest happiness I could ever feel in life, if I could accept it.</t2525> <t2526>But for my mother, my dear, kind-hearted mother, I agree with what Elinor has said; if our absence would make her less happy, less comfortable, Ah! no, nothing should tempt me to leave her.</t2526> <t2527>No, it should not become a struggle.</t2527><t2528>"</t2528>
<t2529>Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood would manage perfectly well without them; Elinor, who had now understood her sister and seen that she had given herself over to the desire to be with Willoughby again, no longer directly opposed the plan and left the matter solely to her mother's decision; however, she did not expect much support from her mother in preventing the trip, which she did not find right for Marianne and had certain reasons to avoid for herself.</t2529> <t2530>Whatever Marianne wanted, her mother wanted to give - she did not expect to persuade her mother to be cautious in a matter where she could not make her approach it with suspicion; therefore, she did not dare to explain the reason behind her reluctance to go to London.</t2530> <t2531>Although Marianne, being a very meticulous person, was well aware of and displeased with Mrs. Jennings' behaviors, the fact that she would overlook every such discomfort and disregard the things that would most hurt her sensitive feelings in pursuit of a certain goal was such a strong, complete proof of the importance of that goal to her that Elinor was not ready to witness it despite everything that had happened.</t2531>
<t2532>When informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood thought that such a trip would be very enjoyable for both her daughters; noticing how much Marianne wanted it based on the affectionate interest shown to her, she did not allow them to decline the invitation because of her; on the contrary, she insisted that they both accept it immediately, and then, with her usual cheerfulness, began to predict how much everyone would gain from this separation.</t2532>
<t2533>"I loved the plan," she exclaimed, "just as I wanted.</t2533> <t2534>Margarethe, we will benefit from this as much as you do.</t2534> <t2535>When you and the Middletons leave, we will live quietly, happily, with our books and music!</t2535> <t2536>When you return, you will find Margaret much advanced!</t2536> <t2537>Also, I have a plan to change your bedrooms; it can now be implemented without disturbing anyone. It is very wise for you to go to the city; every young girl in your situation should get to know the style and entertainments of London.</t2537> <t2538>You will be under the protection of a woman with strong maternal instincts, and I have no doubt she will treat you kindly.</t2538> <t2539>You will surely see your brother too; whatever his faults or his wife's faults, I cannot bear for you to become so estranged when I think of whose son he is.</t2539><t2540>"</t2540>
<t2541>"Because you always care about our happiness," said Elinor, "you overcome every obstacle that comes to your mind in front of this plan, but there is still a difficulty that, in my opinion, cannot be so easily overcome.</t2541><t2542>"</t2542>
<t2543>Marianne's face fell.</t2543>
<t2544>"Well," said Mrs. Dashwood, "what will my one and only sensible Elinor suggest?</t2544> <t2545>What great obstacle will she bring up now?</t2545> <t2546>Don't let me hear you mention the word expense.</t2546><t2547>"</t2547>
<t2548>"My objection is this; I have no doubt about Mrs. Jennings' kindness, but she is not a woman whose company can give us pleasure or whose patronage can bring us importance."</t2548><t2549>"</t2549>
<t2550>"That's very true," replied her mother; "but apart from others, you won't have any dealings with his circle anyway; you always go out in public with Lady Middleton."</t2550><t2551>"</t2551>
<t2552>"If Elinor is uneasy because she doesn't like Mrs. Jennings," said Marianne, "this shouldn't prevent me from accepting the invitation.</t2552> <t2553>I have no such concerns; I am sure I can handle any such unpleasant situation with a little effort.</t2553><t2554>"</t2554>
<t2555>Elinor couldn't help but smile when she saw Marianne now trying to remain indifferent to a person whom she had previously been unable to persuade to respond with reasonable politeness, and decided that if her sister insisted on going, she would go too, because she thought it would not be right to leave Marianne solely to her own judgment or to leave Mrs. Jennings at the mercy of Marianne for the peace of the household.</t2555> <t2556>Additionally, remembering that, according to Lucy, Edward Ferrars would not be in town before February made this decision easier; by that time, their trips would be over without any unnecessary haste.</t2556>
<t2557>"I will send both of you," said Mrs. Dashwood; "these objections are nonsense.</t2557> <t2558>Being in London, especially being together, will be very enjoyable for you; if Elinor deigns to take pleasure in entertainment, she will see that there are many kinds of amusements there; she might even expect something from furthering her acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family.</t2558><t2559>"</t2559>
<t2560>Elinor was often waiting for an opportunity to hint to her mother that she should not rely too much on the bond between herself and Edward; so that when the whole truth came out, the shock might be lessened; now, upon this attack, even though she had no hope of success, she forced herself to begin her plan as calmly as she could by saying, "I like Edward Ferrars very much and I always enjoy seeing him; but whether they know me or not, I am extremely indifferent to the rest of the family.</t2560><t2561>"</t2561>
<t2562>Mrs. Dashwood smiled and said nothing.</t2562> <t2563>Marianne raised her eyes in astonishment and understood that Elinor would do well to hold her tongue.</t2563>
<t2564>After a little more discussion, it was decided to fully accept the invitation.</t2564> <t2565>Mrs. Jennings received the news with great joy and many assurances of interest and attention.</t2565> <t2566>Sir John was also pleased; for a man whose greatest concern was being alone, the increase of two residents in London was quite something.</t2566> <t2567>Even Lady Middleton was pleased, going out of her usual way; as for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, nothing in life had made them as happy as this news.</t2567>
<t2568>Elinor submitted to this arrangement, which was contrary to her wishes, with less resistance than she had expected to feel.</t2568> <t2569>As for herself, it no longer mattered whether she went to the city or not; seeing that the plan made her mother very happy, brought liveliness to her sister's look, voice, and movements, restored her to her usual cheerfulness, and made her even more joyful than before, she could not bring herself to be displeased with the plan, nor did she attempt to doubt its outcome.</t2569>
<t2570>Marianne's joy was almost beyond happiness; her excitement and impatience to leave were at their peak.</t2570> <t2571>Only her reluctance to leave her mother occasionally brought her back to calmness; when the moment of separation came, she was deeply saddened because of this.</t2571> <t2572>Her mother's sorrow was no less than hers; Elinor seemed to be the only one among the three who could think that the separation was not so eternal.</t2572>
<t2573>Their departures began in the first week of January.</t2573> <t2574>The Middletons would follow within a week.</t2574> <t2575>The Miss Steeles continued their stay at the Park; right up until the family's departure.</t2575>
<t2576>They had known Mrs. Jennings for such a short time, and they were so mismatched both in age and spirit, and she herself had objected to such a decision so much just a few days ago, that Elinor could not believe, without being astonished at her own situation, that she was embarking on a journey to London in the same carriage with that lady, under her protection, and as her guest!</t2576> <t2577>Her objections had been overcome or ignored by the happy youthful passion that Marianne and her mother shared; although Elinor sometimes doubted Willoughby's fidelity, she could not watch without feeling how empty her own future was, how relatively joyless her own state of mind was, and how willingly she would share Marianne's delusions to keep alive in her mind the same life-giving fantasy, the same hope, as the happy expectation that filled Marianne's whole soul and shone in her eyes.</t2577> <t2578>However, it was only a short, very short time before they would see what Willoughby's intentions were; he must have already arrived in the city.</t2578> <t2579>Marianne's eagerness to go showed that she was sure she would find him there; Elinor was as determined to observe every new light that her own observations and the opinions of others could shed on his character, as she was to closely watch his behavior towards her sister before their meetings became frequent, to discern what his stance and intentions were.</t2579> <t2580>If the result of her observations was negative, her sister-</t2580>
<t2581>He was absolutely determined to open her eyes; if not, his effort would be different - then he would have to learn to avoid selfish comparisons and to eliminate any regrets that could diminish the satisfaction he would feel from Marianne's happiness.</t2581>
<t2582>It had been three days since they set out, and throughout the journey, Marianne's behavior had provided Mrs. Jennings with a rather happy example of the tolerance and harmony she would show in the future.</t2582> <t2583>She sat almost the entire way in silence, wrapped in her own thoughts, and except for the moments when a beautiful detail of the scenery elicited a cry of delight directed specifically at her sister, she hardly spoke of her own accord.</t2583> <t2584>To make up for this behavior, Elinor immediately took on the duties of politeness she had assigned to herself and treated Mrs. Jennings with great interest, talking to her at every opportunity, laughing with her, and listening to her; for her part, Mrs. Jennings was as kind as possible to both of them, constantly worrying if they were comfortable and in good spirits, and was only distressed when she couldn't let them choose their own meals at the inn, unable to get them to admit that they preferred salmon to cod or boiled chicken to beef steak.</t2584> <t2585>On the third day, they arrived in the city around three o'clock; rejoicing at being freed from the cramped carriage after such a journey and eager to enjoy the luxury of a well-lit fireplace.</t2585>
<t2586>The house was beautiful; it was beautifully furnished; a very comfortable room was immediately given to the young ladies.</t2586> <t2587>This was previously Charlotte's room, and above the fireplace, as proof that she had spent seven years in a large school in the city and had learned something, hung a landscape made of colored silks by her.</t2587>
<t2588>Since the meal wouldn't be ready for another two hours, Elinor decided to use that time to write a letter to her mother and sat down at the table for this purpose.</t2588> <t2589>A few minutes later, Marianne did the same.</t2589> <t2590>"I am writing to Mother, Marianne," said Elinor; "wouldn't it be better if you postponed your letter for a day or two?</t2590><t2591>"</t2591>
<t2592>"I am not writing to my mother," Marianne replied hastily, as if wanting to prevent further questions.</t2592> <t2593>Elinor said nothing more; it immediately occurred to her that Marianne must be writing to Willoughby, which led her to conclude that they must be secretly engaged, even if they wanted to keep the relationship hidden.</t2593> <t2594>Although this belief was not entirely satisfying, it pleased her, and she continued her letter with greater attention.</t2594> <t2595>Marianne's letter was finished within a few minutes; after all, it could not be more than a note: then it was folded, sealed, and the address was written with eager haste.</t2595> <t2596>Elinor discerned a large W in the address from a distance, and as soon as the address was written, Marianne rang the bell and asked the servant who came to send the letter with a two-penny postage.</t2596> <t2597>The matter was thus quickly settled.</t2597>
<t2598>Marianne continued with the same pleasure, but there was a flutter in her joy that prevented her sister from being too happy, and this excitement increased as the evening approached.</t2598> <t2599>She couldn't eat much at dinner; and when they returned to the living room, she seemed to listen anxiously to every sound of a car.</t2599>
<t2600>Elinor was quite pleased that Mrs. Jennings, absorbed in her own affairs in her room, could see very little of what was happening.</t2600> <t2601>By the time tea was served, Marianne had already been disappointed several times by the knocking at the neighbor's door, when suddenly a door sound loud enough not to be mistaken for another house was heard.</t2601> <t2602>Elinor was sure that Willoughby would be announced; Marianne also started to move towards the door.</t2602> <t2603>Everything was silent; this could not be endured for long; she opened the door, took a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening for about half a minute, she returned to the room in the full excitement of believing she had heard his voice; in the intoxication of her current feelings, she involuntarily exclaimed, "Oh Elinor, it's Willoughby, truly!" and just as she was about to throw herself into his arms, Colonel Brandon appeared.</t2603>
<t2604>It was a shock too great to be met with calm, and Marianne immediately left the room.</t2604> <t2605>Elinor was also disappointed; but at the same time, her respect for Colonel Brandon made her welcome him, and she sincerely regretted seeing that a man who was so interested in her sister felt nothing but bitterness and disappointment towards her when they met.</t2605> <t2606>She immediately saw that this did not escape Colonel Brandon's notice, and that he watched Marianne with surprise and concern, even as she left the room without giving him a chance to fulfill the requirements of courtesy towards her.</t2606>
<t2607>"Is your sister sick?" he said.</t2607>
<t2608>Elinor, in distress, said she was ill, then spoke of headaches, weakness, malaise, and every reasonable cause she could attribute to her sister's behavior.</t2608>
<t2609>Colonel Brandon listened to him carefully but seemed more like he was trying to compose himself, and without saying anything further on the subject, he directly started to express his happiness at seeing them in London, asking about their journey and the families they had left behind.</t2609>
<t2610>They continued to speak in such a calm tone, with very little interest on either side; both were unhappy, both had their minds elsewhere.</t2610> <t2611>Elinor very much wanted to ask if Willoughby was in town at that time, but she was afraid of causing him pain by asking about his rival; finally, just for the sake of conversation, she asked if he had been in London the whole time since they last met.</t2611> <t2612>"Yes," Colonel Brandon answered with slight discomfort, "almost always; I went to Delaford for a few days once or twice, but it was not possible for me to return to Barton.</t2612><t2613>"</t2613>
<t2614>These words and the manner in which they were spoken immediately brought to mind the annoyance and suspicions that Mrs. Jennings had caused, and the way she had left because of them, and she feared that her question gave the impression of being more curious about the matter than she actually was.</t2614>
<t2615>Mrs Jennings arrived shortly after.</t2615> <t2616>"Ah Colonel," she said, in her usual boisterous cheerfulness, "I am so delighted to see you - sorry I couldn't come earlier - forgive me, but I had to tidy myself up a bit, take care of my affairs, after all, I haven't been home for a long time; you know when a person is away for a while, they have to deal with a lot of little things when they return; I entrusted the matters to Cartwright again - my goodness, I've been working like a bee since lunch!</t2616> <t2617>But Colonel, how did you guess I would come to town today?</t2617><t2618>"</t2618>
<t2619>"I heard it at the Palmers'; I was at dinner.</t2619><t2620>"</t2620>
<t2621>"Ah! So that's how it is; well, how are they as a family?</t2621> <t2622>How is Charlotte?</t2622> <t2623>I bet her belly has gotten huge.</t2623><t2624>"</t2624>
<t2625>"Mrs. Palmer looked very well; I am also tasked with telling you that you will definitely see her tomorrow.</t2625><t2626>"</t2626>
<t2627>"Of course, I guessed as much.</t2627> <t2628>Look Colonel, I brought two young ladies with me, as you can see - I mean, you can only see one now, but there's another one somewhere else, your friend Miss Marianne - you won't be sorry to hear that.</t2628> <t2629>What you do about Mr. Willoughby is up to you.</t2629> <t2630>Ah, to be young and beautiful is such a sweet thing.</t2630> <t2631>Yes! I was young once too, but I was never beautiful - it's just fate.</t2631> <t2632>Nevertheless, I had a very good husband, and I don't know what greater beauty could achieve more than that.</t2632> <t2633>Ah, my poor husband!</t2633> <t2634>He passed away eight years ago.</t2634> <t2635>But Colonel, where have you been since we last met?</t2635> <t2636>How are your affairs going?</t2636> <t2637>Come on, there are no secrets among friends.</t2637><t2638>"</t2638>
<t2639>Colonel Brandon answered all his questions with his usual moderation but did not fully answer any of them.</t2639> <t2640>Elinor started making tea, and Marianne had to reappear.</t2640>
<t2641>After his arrival, Colonel Brandon became even more pensive and silent; Mrs. Jennings could not persuade him to stay a little longer.</t2641> <t2642>Since no other visitor came that evening, the ladies unanimously decided to go to bed early.</t2642>
<t2643>Marianne woke up the next morning cheerful and happy.</t2643> <t2644>The disappointment of the previous evening seemed to have been forgotten in the anticipation of what the day would bring.</t2644> <t2645>It had not been long since they finished their breakfast when Mrs. Palmer's carriage stopped at the door, and she entered the room laughing within seconds; she was so delighted to see them all that it was hard to say whether she was more pleased to see her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.</t2645> <t2646>Although this was what she had wanted from the beginning, she was very surprised by their arrival in the city; she was very upset that they accepted her mother's invitation after rejecting her own, but still, she would not have forgiven them if they had not come!</t2646>
<t2647>"Mr. Palmer will be happy to see you," he said; "when he heard you were coming with my mother, what do you think he said?</t2647> <t2648>I forgot what he said now, but it was something very funny!</t2648><t2649>"</t2649>
<t2650>After spending a couple of hours in an atmosphere that her mother called casual conversation, but in other words, where Mrs. Jennings asked about every detail of all her acquaintances and Mrs. Palmer laughed for no reason, Mrs. Palmer suggested that they all join her as she had a few shops to visit that morning; Mrs. Jennings and Elinor accepted the offer, as they also had shopping to do; Marianne initially refused but was later persuaded to go.</t2650>
<t2651>Wherever they went, they were visibly on alert, waiting.</t2651> <t2652>Especially on Bond Street, where most of their business took place, their eyes constantly scanned the surroundings; in every shop the group visited, their mind was completely detached from everything in front of them that concerned and distracted the others.</t2652> <t2653>Because they were uncomfortable and uneasy everywhere, their sister couldn't get their opinion on things to be bought or sold that concerned both of them equally; they took no pleasure in anything; they were just impatient to return home and could barely suppress their anger towards Mrs. Palmer, who was distracted by every beautiful, expensive, or new thing, had an insatiable appetite for buying everything, couldn't decide on anything, and wasted her time in admiration and indecision.</t2653>
<t2654>It was noon when they returned home; as soon as they entered the house, Marianne flew up the stairs; when Elinor followed her, she found her turning away from the table with a sad face; this indicated that Willoughby had not come.</t2654>
<t2655>"After we left, was no letter left for me?" he said later to the servant who entered with the packages.</t2655> <t2656>He received a negative response.</t2656> <t2657>"Are you absolutely sure?" he continued.</t2657> <t2658>"No servant, messenger, or anyone left a letter or note?</t2658><t2659>"</t2659>
<t2660>The man said he didn't leave it.</t2660>
<t2661>"Very strange!" he said in a low and resentful voice, turning to the window.</t2661>
<t2662>"How very strange indeed!" Elinor repeated to herself, watching her sister uneasily.</t2662> <t2663>"If he didn't know she was in town, he wouldn't write to her; he must have written to Combe Magna; if he's in town, it's very strange that he hasn't come or written!</t2663> <t2664>Oh mother, how wrong you were to allow such a young girl to become engaged to someone we know so little about, to let her be swept away in such a suspicious, such a mysterious manner!</t2664> <t2665>I want to ask, but how will she react to my interference!</t2665><t2666>"</t2666>
<t2667>After thinking for a while, he decided to write to his mother with strong expressions, informing her that the matter needed to be seriously addressed if the apparent situation continued to be unpleasant for a few more days as it was now.</t2667>
<t2668>Two elderly ladies, close friends whom Mrs. Palmer and Mrs. Jennings encountered in the morning and invited, had dinner with them.</t2668> <t2669>Mrs. Palmer left them right after tea to carry out her evening activities; Elinor also helped set up a whist table for the others.</t2669> <t2670>Marianne was useless in such situations because she had never learned the game, but being left alone did not give her more pleasure than it did Elinor, as the evening passed in the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment.</t2670> <t2671>From time to time, she tried to read a book for a few minutes; but soon she threw the book aside and engaged in a more interesting activity, walking up and down the room, pausing for a moment at the window to listen for the sound she had been waiting for.</t2671>
<t2672>"If this fine weather continues a bit longer," said Mrs. Jennings, when they met at breakfast the next morning, "Sir John will not want to leave Barton next week; the hunters do not want to miss even a single day of their pleasure!</t2672> <t2673>Poor things! I feel sorry for them when that happens; it really gets to them.</t2673><t2674>"</t2674>
<t2675>"That's true," Marianne exclaimed in a cheerful voice, and while speaking, she walked to the window to look at the sky, "I hadn't thought of that.</t2675> <t2676>This weather will keep many hunters in the village.</t2676><t2677>"</t2677>
<t2678>It was a lucky recollection; it brought back all his cheerfulness.</t2678> <t2679>"It's truly a unique atmosphere for them," he continued, sitting at the breakfast table with a happy face.</t2679> <t2680>"Who knows how much they are enjoying it!</t2680> <t2681>But" (with a small flash of concern again) "it probably won't last long.</t2681> <t2682>At this time of the year, after such continuous rain, it's clear that more will follow.</t2682> <t2683>Soon it will start to freeze, perhaps even severely.</t2683> <t2684>Maybe within a day or two; this excessively warm weather can't last much longer - perhaps it will even frost tonight!</t2684><t2685>"</t2685>
<t2686>"But surely," said Elinor, in order to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her brother's thoughts as clearly as she did, "Sir John and Lady Middleton will be in town until the end of next week.</t2686><t2687>"</t2687>
<t2688>"Yes, my dear, I hope so too.</t2688> <t2689>Mary always does what she sets her mind to.</t2689><t2690>"</t2690>
<t2691>"Now," Elinor quietly speculated, "he will write to Combe with today's mail.</t2691><t2692>"</t2692>
<t2693>Even if it was written, the letter was composed and sent in a secrecy that thwarted efforts to understand the truth.</t2693> <t2694>Regardless of the extent of its truth and despite Elinor being far from pleased about it, she wouldn't be too disturbed as long as she saw Marianne so cheerful.</t2694> <t2695>And Marianne was cheerful; happy with the mild weather, and even happier with the expectation of frost.</t2695>
<t2696>The morning mostly passed with leaving cards at the homes of Mrs. Jennings' friends to inform them that she was in town; Marianne was constantly occupied with observing the direction of the wind, watching the movements in the sky, and imagining changes in the weather.</t2696>
<t2697>"Doesn't it feel colder to you this morning, Elinor?</t2697> <t2698>There is a very definite difference, in my opinion.</t2698> <t2699>I can't keep my hands warm even inside my gloves.</t2699> <t2700>It wasn't like this yesterday, I think.</t2700> <t2701>The clouds seem to be clearing too, the sun will come out soon; it will be clear in the afternoon.</t2701><t2702>"</t2702>
<t2703>Elinor was sometimes bored and sometimes sad; but Marianne persisted and every night in the light of the fireplace, every morning in the appearance of the sky, she saw the obvious signs of the approaching frost.</t2703>
<t2704>For Miss Dashwoods, Mrs. Jennings' lifestyle and circle of friends were not more disturbing than her behavior towards them; she treated them very kindly.</t2704> <t2705>The entire arrangement of her house was conducted with the utmost freedom; despite Lady Middleton's strong dislike, she visited no one except a few old city friends she could never give up, and being introduced to those friends never hurt the feelings of her young guests.</t2705> <t2706>Elinor, who was pleased to find herself in a better situation than she had expected in this regard, tried to compensate for her lack of cheerfulness with their evening parties, but whether at home or outside, she found little to entertain her in these parties, which consisted only of card games.</t2706>
<t2707>Colonel Brandon, a natural guest of the house, was with them almost every day; he came to see Marianne and to chat with Elinor; Elinor often found conversing with him more enjoyable than other daily events, but at the same time, she observed his interest in her sister with deep concern.</t2707> <t2708>She feared that this was a growing interest.</t2708> <t2709>It pained her to see the passion in Colonel Brandon’s gaze as he watched Marianne; his mood was clearly worse than it had been at Barton.</t2709>
<t2710>It was confirmed about a week after their arrival that Willoughby had also come.</t2710> <t2711>When they returned from their morning carriage ride, his card was on the table.</t2711>
<t2712>"Oh my God!" cried Marianne, "he came here while we were outside."</t2712> <t2713>Elinor, who was pleased that he was in London, now dared to say, "then he will definitely come again tomorrow."</t2713> <t2714>But Marianne didn't seem to hear her, and when Mrs. Jennings came in, she fled with the precious card.</t2714>
<t2715>While this event pleased Elinor, it excited her sister even more than before.</t2715> <t2716>From that moment on, she could not calm down; the expectation of seeing Willoughby at every hour of the day kept her away from everything else.</t2716> <t2717>The next morning, while the others went out, she insisted on staying at home.</t2717>
<t2718>Elinor's thoughts were filled with what might be happening on Berkeley Street during their absence; but when they returned, a glance at her sister's face was enough for her to understand that Willoughby had not made a second visit.</t2718> <t2719>Just then, a note was brought in and left on the table.</t2719>
<t2720>"To me?" cried Marianne, rushing forward hastily.</t2720>
<t2721>"No, ma'am, to my wife."</t2721><t2722>"</t2722>
<t2723>But the skeptical Marianne immediately took the note.</t2723>
<t2724>"Indeed, how annoying Mrs. Jennings is!"</t2724>
<t2725>"Are you expecting a letter?" said Elinor, unable to remain silent any longer.</t2725>
<t2726>"Yes, a little, not much."</t2726><t2727>"</t2727>
<t2728>After a short silence, "You don't trust me, Marianne.</t2728><t2729>"</t2729>
<t2730>"No Elinor, at least you don't say that - you are the one who doesn't trust anyone!</t2730><t2731>"</t2731>
<t2732>"Me!" replied Elinor, confused; "well Marianne, I have nothing to say.</t2732><t2733>"</t2733>
<t2734>"I don't have any either," Marianne replied angrily, "so our situations are the same.</t2734> <t2735>Neither of us has anything to say; you because you haven't told anything, and I because I haven't hidden anything.</t2735><t2736>"</t2736>
<t2737>Elinor, who was annoyed by the accusation of being tight-lipped but had no chance to defend herself, did not know how she could force Marianne to be more open under those circumstances.</t2737>
<t2738>Mrs. Jennings appeared shortly after, the note was given to her, and she read it aloud.</t2738> <t2739>It was from Lady Middleton, informing them that they had arrived at Conduit Street the previous night and inviting her mother and cousins for that evening.</t2739> <t2740>Sir John's business and his severe cold had prevented them from stopping by Berkeley Street.</t2740> <t2741>The invitation was accepted; but as the appointed time approached, Elinor had difficulty persuading her sister to go, as both of them were obliged by courtesy to accompany Mrs. Jennings on this visit. Marianne had not yet heard a word from Willoughby; thus, she was not inclined to go out for entertainment, nor did she want to risk Willoughby calling and not finding her.</t2741>
<t2742>When the evening ended, Elinor saw that this reluctance had not changed much with the change of location; although they had not yet properly settled in the city, Sir John had managed to gather twenty young people around him and entertain them all with a ball.</t2742> <t2743>However, this was a situation that Lady Middleton did not approve of.</t2743> <t2744>An impromptu dance in the village would be considered quite reasonable; but</t2744>
<t2745>In London, the reputation for elegance was more important and less easily attained, and it was an unnecessary risk for it to be known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance with eight to ten couples, two violins, and a single buffet just to entertain a few girls.</t2745>
<t2746>Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were also at the party; since he had been careful not to appear to show interest in his mother-in-law and thus never approached her, Mr. Palmer, whom they saw for the first time upon their entrance into the hall, did not show any sign of recognizing them.</t2746> <t2747>He glanced at them lightly without appearing to know who they were, then merely nodded his head in greeting to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room.</t2747> <t2748>When Marianne entered, she glanced around the circle; that was enough, he was not there - and she sat down, equally unwilling to enjoy or to give enjoyment.</t2748> <t2749>About an hour later, when they had gathered, Mr. Palmer approached the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise at seeing them in the city; yet earlier, Colonel Brandon had mentioned at home that they had come, and when he heard they had arrived, he had said something very funny.</t2749>
<t2750>"I thought you were both in Devonshire," he said.</t2750>
<t2751>"Is that so?" replied Elinor.</t2751>
<t2752>"When are you returning?"</t2752><t2753>"</t2753>
<t2754>"I don't know."</t2754> <t2755>Thus, their conversation ended.</t2755>
<t2756>Marianne had never been more reluctant to dance in her life than she was that evening, and she had never been so tired of moving.</t2756> <t2757>She complained about it as they turned onto Berkeley Street.</t2757>
<t2758>"Come on, come on," said Mrs. Jennings, "we all know the reason very well; if a certain person, who shall remain nameless, had been there, you wouldn't have been tired at all; to tell the truth, it wasn't very nice of him not to meet you despite being invited.</t2758><t2759>"</t2759>
<t2760>"An invitation!" Marianne exclaimed.</t2760>
<t2761>"My daughter Middleton told me so, because apparently Sir John ran into her on the street this morning."</t2761><t2762>"</t2762>
<t2763>Marianne did not say anything else, but she looked extremely hurt.</t2763> <t2764>In this situation, Elinor, eager to do something to comfort her sister, decided to write to their mother the next morning, hoping to prompt her to inquire about Marianne's health and ask the long-postponed questions; when she noticed after breakfast that Marianne was writing to Willoughby again, as she could not assume she was writing to anyone else, she decided to pursue this measure more diligently.</t2764>
<t2765>Towards midday, Mrs. Jennings went out on her own for some errands, and Elinor immediately began her letter; meanwhile, Marianne, too distressed to occupy herself with anything and too anxious to engage in conversation, walked from one window to another or sat by the fire lost in sorrowful thoughts.</t2765> <t2766>Elinor was very resolute in her appeal to her mother, recounting everything that had happened, expressing her doubts about Willoughby's honesty, and invoking every sense of responsibility and affection to urge her to ask Marianne to clarify her true situation with Willoughby.</t2766>
<t2767>She had just finished the letter when the knock on the door indicated the arrival of a visitor; then it was announced that Colonel Brandon had arrived.</t2767> <t2768>Seeing him from the window, Marianne, not in the mood to see anyone, left the room before he entered.</t2768> <t2769>Colonel Brandon looked more serious than ever; although he expressed his pleasure at finding Miss Dashwood alone, he sat for a while without saying anything, as if he had something specific to tell her.</t2769> <t2770>Believing he had something to say about her sister, Elinor impatiently waited for him to bring up the subject.</t2770> <t2771>This was not the first time she had heard such a belief; several times before, he had started with observations like "your sister looks ill today," or "your sister seems out of sorts today," appearing either to explain or inquire about something specific regarding her.</t2771> <t2772>After a few minutes of silence, he broke it with a slightly excited voice, asking when he should congratulate Elinor on the new brother-in-law joining the family.</t2772> <t2773>Elinor was unprepared for such a question; having no ready answer, she had to take the shortest route and ask what he meant.</t2773> <t2774>Colonel Brandon tried to smile as he replied, "it is known by everyone that your sister is engaged to Mr. Willoughby.</t2774><t2775>"</t2775>
<t2776>"It cannot be known," replied Elinor, "because even his own family does not know.</t2776><t2777>"</t2777>
<t2778>Colonel Brandon was surprised and said, "I beg your pardon, I'm afraid my question was disrespectful; but it didn't occur to me that it was meant to be kept secret, since they corresponded openly and everyone talked about their marriage."</t2778><t2779>"</t2779>
<t2780>"How is that possible?</t2780> <t2781>From whom could you have heard this?</t2781><t2782>"</t2782>
<t2783>"From many people - some you don't know, others you are very close with, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.</t2783> <t2784>If it were up to me, I still wouldn't believe it, because when the mind doesn't want to believe, it always finds something to doubt; but even if I didn't believe it, I accidentally saw a letter in the butler's hand today as he was letting me in, it was written by your sister to Mr. Willoughby.</t2784> <t2785>I came to ask, but I believed without needing to ask.</t2785> <t2786>Is everything settled?</t2786> <t2787>Is there a possibility? But I have no right to ask, and I have no chance of success anyway.</t2787> <t2788>Forgive me, Miss Dashwood.</t2788> <t2789>I realize I made a mistake by talking so much, but I don't know what to do and I trust your good sense.</t2789> <t2790>Tell me that everything is finalized, that it just needs to be kept secret for a little while longer, if it is possible to keep it secret, tell me that it has come to this.</t2790><t2791>"</t2791>
<t2792>Elinor got the clear impression from these words that Colonel Brandon had completely renounced his love for her sister, and she was very moved.</t2792> <t2793>She couldn't say anything immediately; even when she managed to collect herself, she struggled for a short while to determine what the most appropriate response would be.</t2793> <t2794>She knew so little about the true state of affairs between her sister and Willoughby that there was a danger of saying something incorrect or inappropriate while trying to explain.</t2794> <t2795>Nevertheless, she knew that Marianne's love for Willoughby was so strong that it left no chance of success for Colonel Brandon, regardless of the outcome of that love. At the same time, she wanted to prevent her sister's actions from being scorned, and after some thought, she decided that it would be more prudent and kind to say more than she actually knew or believed.</t2795> <t2796>Thus, she said that although they hadn't told her how they had come to an understanding, she did not doubt their mutual affection and was not surprised to hear that they were corresponding.</t2796>
<t2797>Colonel Brandon listened to him with quiet attention, and when his words were finished, he immediately rose from his seat and said in an emotional voice, "I wish your sister endless happiness; I hope Willoughby can strive to be worthy of her," - he said, asked for permission, and left.</t2797>
<t2798>Elinor did not gain any positive feelings from this conversation that would alleviate her unease about other matters; on the contrary, she was left with the sorrow she felt for Colonel Brandon's unhappiness, and her concern about the event that would confirm this unhappiness even prevented her from wishing for its passing.</t2798>
<t2799>For the next three or four days, nothing happened to make Elinor regret her appeal to her mother, because Willoughby neither came nor wrote.</t2799> <t2800>Towards the end of that period, they had promised to accompany Lady Middleton to a party; Mrs. Jennings could not attend the party due to her younger daughter's indisposition; Marianne, who appeared extremely despondent, careless in appearance, and equally indifferent to where she went or stayed, prepared for this party without showing a single glimmer of hope or expression of pleasure.</t2800> <t2801>After tea, she sat in the drawing-room until Lady Middleton arrived, without moving from her chair, without changing her posture, lost in her own thoughts, unaware of her sister's presence; finally, when it was said that Lady Middleton was waiting for them at the door, she started as if she had completely forgotten they were expecting someone.</t2801>
<t2802>They arrived at their destination just in time; as soon as the chain of cars in front of them allowed, they got out, climbed the stairs, heard their names being called out loudly from one hall to another, and entered a magnificently lit, very crowded, and unbearably hot room.</t2802> <t2803>After bowing to the lady of the house and fulfilling the requirements of courtesy, they were allowed to mingle with the crowd and share in the heat and congestion to which their arrival had undoubtedly contributed.</t2803> <t2804>By speaking little and moving even less, they spent some time</t2804>
<t2805>Afterwards, Lady Middleton sat down to play cards; Marianne, not in the mood to wander around, and Elinor, finding an empty seat by chance, settled in a place not too far from the table.</t2805>
<t2806>It hadn't been long since she sat down in this manner when Elinor saw Willoughby; he was standing a few steps away, engrossed in an animated conversation with a very elegant-looking young woman.</t2806> <t2807>Soon after, he made eye contact with her; Willoughby immediately nodded in greeting, but did not attempt to speak to her or approach Marianne, even though he saw her; then he continued talking with the same lady.</t2807> <t2808>Elinor involuntarily turned to Marianne to see if she had noticed what had happened.</t2808> <t2809>Marianne noticed Willoughby at that moment, and her whole face lit up with sudden joy as she immediately started to go towards him, but her sister held her back.</t2809>
<t2810>"Oh my God!" cried Marianne, "there - it's him, there.</t2810> <t2811>-But why isn't he looking at me?</t2811> <t2812>Why can't I talk to him?</t2812><t2813>"</t2813>
<t2814>"Please control yourself," said Elinor, "don't show your emotions to everyone.</t2814> <t2815>Maybe he hasn't seen you yet.</t2815><t2816>"</t2816>
<t2817>However, she herself did not believe this; being able to control herself at such a moment was not only something Marianne could not manage, but also something she could not even conceive of.</t2817> <t2818>She sat in the agony of impatience; her emotions reflected on her face.</t2818>
<t2819>Willoughby turned that way again and looked at both of them; Marianne jumped to her feet, said his name in a loving voice, and extended her hand to him.</t2819> <t2820>Willoughby approached and, as if determined to avoid their eyes and not see their reactions, addressed Elinor more than Marianne, hurriedly asking about Mrs. Dashwood's health and how long they had been in town.</t2820> <t2821>Elinor was stunned by such a conversation and couldn't utter a single word.</t2821> <t2822>But her sister's feelings were instantly expressed.</t2822> <t2823>Marianne, her face flushed, cried out in an excited voice, "For God's sake! Willoughby, what does this mean?</t2823> <t2824>Didn't you receive my letters?</t2824> <t2825>Won't you shake hands with me?</t2825><t2826>"</t2826>
<t2827>Willoughby couldn't escape from this, but his touch seemed to cause him pain, and he held her hand for only a moment.</t2827> <t2828>All this time, he was evidently struggling to maintain his composure.</t2828> <t2829>Elinor watched his face and saw that his expression had calmed.</t2829> <t2830>After a moment of silence, Willoughby spoke in a dull manner.</t2830>
<t2831>"Last Tuesday, I had the honor of stopping by Berkeley Street, and I was very sorry that I was not fortunate enough to find you and Mrs. Jennings at home.</t2831> <t2832>I hope my card has not been lost.</t2832><t2833>"</t2833>
<t2834>"Didn't you take my notes?" Marianne cried out with wild anxiety.</t2834> <t2835>"I'm sure there is a mistake - a terrible mistake.</t2835> <t2836>What could this mean?</t2836> <t2837>Tell me, Willoughby; for God's sake, tell me, what is the matter?</t2837><t2838>"</t2838>
<t2839>Willoughby did not answer; his face changed and his discomfort returned; but as if he felt the necessity to make an effort immediately upon catching the eye of the young lady he had been speaking to earlier, he composed himself again and said, "Yes, I had the pleasure of learning about your arrival in town, you were kind enough to inform me," then he gave a slight bow and hurriedly walked away to join his friend.</t2839>
<t2840>Marianne, whose face had turned completely pale and who could no longer stand, collapsed into her chair; Elinor, expecting her to faint at any moment, stepped in front of her to shield her from the eyes of others while trying to revive her with lavender water.</t2840>
<t2841>"Go and get Elinor," cried Marianne, as soon as she came to herself, "bring her to me by force.</t2841> <t2842>Tell her I need to see her again -I need to talk to her immediately.</t2842> <t2843>-I can't stay still -I won't have a moment's peace until these are explained -there must be some terrible misunderstanding.</t2843> <t2844>Go at once.</t2844><t2845>"</t2845>
<t2846>"How can it be?</t2846> <t2847>No Marianne, you must wait.</t2847> <t2848>This is not the place for explanations.</t2848> <t2849>Wait until tomorrow.</t2849><t2850>"</t2850>
<t2851>With difficulty, he managed to prevent her from following, but it was impossible to persuade her to control her excitement, to wait in a composed manner until she had a proper opportunity to speak with Willoughby alone; because Marianne continued to express her inner misery in a low voice, lamenting incessantly.</t2851> <t2852>A short while later, Elinor saw Willoughby leave the room and head towards the stairs; she told Marianne that it was impossible to speak with him again that evening, so she should calm down.</t2852> <t2853>Marianne then asked her sister to request Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was feeling too unwell to stay any longer.</t2853>
<t2854>Lady Middleton was in the middle of a hand, but when she heard that Marianne was not well, she behaved kindly enough not to object to leaving and handed over her cards to a friend; they left as soon as a carriage was found.</t2854> <t2855>Not a word was spoken as they returned to Berkeley Street.</t2855> <t2856>Marianne was in silent agony; she was too tense to cry; but fortunately, since Mrs. Jennings had not yet returned home, they were able to go directly to their rooms; the spirits of ammonia revived her a little.</t2856> <t2857>She immediately undressed and went to bed; as she wanted to be alone, her sister left her side and, while waiting for Mrs. Jennings to return, she thought long and hard about the past.</t2857>
<t2858>One could not doubt that some kind of understanding still existed between Willoughby and Marianne; on the other hand, it was equally clear that Willoughby had grown tired of it; because even though Marianne still indulged in her own wishes, Elinor could not attribute such behavior to any kind of mistake or misunderstanding.</t2858> <t2859>Nothing but a complete change of feeling could explain this situation.</t2859> <t2860>If she had not witnessed the discomfort that showed Willoughby was aware of his own misconduct, her anger would have been even greater, and she would have believed him to be someone so devoid of character as to play with her sister's feelings without any serious intention from the beginning.</t2860> <t2861>Not seeing each other might have diminished his interest; his comfort-loving nature might have helped him forget; but Elinor could never doubt that such an interest had once existed.</t2861>
<t2862>As for Marianne, she could not think without deep anxiety of the pains that such an unhappy encounter must have caused her, and the even more severe pains that awaited her as the probable result of the encounter.</t2862> <t2863>Her own situation was relatively better now; although she still cared for Edward as much as ever, her mind would always be clear even if they were to part in the future.</t2863> <t2864>But all the circumstances that could exacerbate such a disaster seemed to come together to increase Marianne's sorrow in her separation from Willoughby, in her swift and irrevocable break from him.</t2864>
<t2865>The next morning, before the servant lit the fireplace and before the sun gained strength over the cold, on a gloomy January morning, Marianne, half-dressed, was kneeling in front of one of the chairs near the window to get a little light, writing quickly as much as her continuous tears allowed.</t2865> <t2866>Elinor, awakened from her sleep by her groans and sobs, saw her in this state; after watching in silent concern for a few minutes, she said in a very gentle, affectionate voice, "Marianne, may I ask you something?" "No, Elinor," Marianne replied, "don't ask anything; you will soon learn everything.</t2866><t2867>"</t2867>
<t2868>After these words were spoken, the hopeless calm did not continue; immediately afterward, the same overwhelming grief returned.</t2868> <t2869>It took her some time to continue her letter; the bouts of crying that repeatedly forced her to stop writing convinced Elinor that she was writing to Willoughby for the last time.</t2869>
<t2870>Elinor showed every calm and measured concern she could; she would have liked to try to soothe and calm her further, but Marianne, with all the energy of a nervous sensitivity, asked her not to say a single word.</t2870> <t2871>Under these circumstances, it would be better for both of them not to stay together for long; Marianne's restless state, after getting dressed, did not allow her to stay in the room for another moment-</t2871>
<t2872>Not only did it prevent him, but because he wanted to be alone and constantly move around, it also caused him to wander around the house until breakfast time, trying to stay out of everyone's sight.</t2872>
<t2873>He neither ate anything at breakfast nor attempted to eat anything; at that moment, Elinor's focus was not on insisting on him, not on pitying him, not on appearing to show interest in him, but on completely diverting Mrs. Jennings' attention to herself.</t2873>
<t2874>Since breakfast was Mrs. Jennings' favorite meal, it lasted quite a while; then they were settling around the round work table when a letter was brought to Marianne; Marianne grabbed the letter from the servant excitedly, her face turning as pale as a ghost, and immediately rushed out of the room.</t2874> <t2875>Seeing this and understanding as clearly as if she had seen the address that the letter was from Willoughby, Elinor felt such a pang of anxiety that she couldn't find the strength to lift her head and sat there trembling, fearing that her condition would not go unnoticed by Mrs. Jennings.</t2875> <t2876>However, that good-natured lady had only seen that Marianne received a letter from Willoughby, which seemed like a good joke to her; she was now making a joke, laughing and hoping that Marianne would like the letter.</t2876> <t2877>On the other hand, she was too busy measuring wool for her carpet to notice Elinor's distress; as soon as Marianne left, she calmly continued her conversation,</t2877>
<t2878>"God knows, I've never seen a young girl so desperately in love in my life!</t2878> <t2879>My daughters were nothing compared to her, and they were a bit foolish anyway; but Miss Marianne was quite taken, poor thing.</t2879> <t2880>I sincerely hope the young man doesn't keep her waiting too long, because seeing her so sad and sullen is very painful.</t2880> <t2881>Indeed, when will they get married?</t2881><t2882>"</t2882>
<t2883>Elinor had never been more reluctant to speak than at that moment, but she felt compelled to respond to such an attack and, trying to smile, she said, "Do you really believe, Madam, that my sister is engaged to Willoughby?"</t2883> <t2884>At first, I thought it was just a joke, but such a serious</t2884>
<t2885>I</t2885>
<t2886>The question seems to imply more; therefore, I must ask you to stop deceiving yourself further.</t2886> <t2887>Rest assured, nothing would surprise me more than hearing they are getting married.</t2887><t2888>"</t2888>
<t2889>"Shame on you, shame on you, Miss Dashwood! How can you speak like this!</t2889> <t2890>Haven't we all known that from the moment they met, they were madly in love with each other and would eventually get married?</t2890> <t2891>Didn't I see them together every day and all day in Devonshire?</t2891> <t2892>Don't I know that your sister came to the city with me to buy a wedding dress?</t2892> <t2893>Come on, come on, this is not right.</t2893> <t2894>You think you are very clever about this and that no one else has any intuition; but that's not the case at all, if you ask me, because it has been known all over the city for a long time.</t2894> <t2895>I tell everyone, really, and so does Charlotte.</t2895><t2896>"</t2896>
<t2897>"Truly, Madam," said Elinor in a very serious tone, "you are mistaken.</t2897> <t2898>Indeed, by spreading this matter around, you are doing something very unkind, and even if you don't believe me now, you will see that you are."</t2898><t2899>"</t2899>
<t2900>Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor was in no state to continue talking and, in her impatience to learn what Willoughby had written, hurried to their rooms; upon opening the door, she found Marianne lying on the bed, nearly suffocating from pain, with a letter in her hand and several others scattered around.</t2900> <t2901>Elinor approached, but without saying a word; she sat on the bed and held her hand, kissed her lovingly several times, and then burst into tears with a force no less than Marianne's.</t2901> <t2902>Although Marianne could not speak, she showed that she felt the full tenderness of this gesture, and after a few minutes spent in shared sorrow, she placed all the letters into Elinor's hands; then she covered her face with a handkerchief and cried out as if in screams.</t2902> <t2903>Knowing that such pain, though distressing to watch, needed to run its course, Elinor stood by Marianne until this extreme agony subsided in some way, then turned with curiosity to Willoughby's letter and began to read:</t2903>
<t2904>Bond Street, January</t2904>
<t2905>Dear Madam,</t2905>
<t2906>I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks for the letter I had the honor of receiving just now.</t2906> <t2907>I am saddened to learn that there was something in my behavior last night that you did not approve of; although I find it difficult to understand in what way I might have unfortunately offended you, I assure you that it was entirely unintentional and I beg your pardon.</t2907> <t2908>I cannot recall my old friendship with your family in Devonshire without a grateful pleasure; I hope that this friendship will not be spoiled by any fault of mine or by a misunderstanding of my actions.</t2908> <t2909>I have the utmost sincere respect for your entire family; but if I have had the misfortune of leading to more belief than I felt or intended, I blame myself for not being more careful in the way I expressed that respect.</t2909> <t2910>You will understand that it is impossible for me to have meant more when you learn that my heart has long belonged elsewhere and that only weeks remain until that promise is fulfilled.</t2910> <t2911>I am fulfilling your command to return the letters with which you honored me and the lock of hair you kindly bestowed upon me with great sorrow.</t2911>
<t2912>Your servant, John Willoughby</t2912>
<t2913>It can be imagined with what anger Miss Dashwood read such a letter.</t2913> <t2914>Although she was aware before starting to read that the letter contained a confession of renunciation and confirmed their separation, she was not aware that such language could be used to convey this; moreover, she could not have imagined that Willoughby could stray so far from any sense of honor and decency -from the natural courtesy of a gentleman- to send such a brazenly cruel letter: a letter that, instead of expressing regrets along with the desire to part, refused to acknowledge the abuse of trust, denied all forms of affection -a letter where every line was a separate insult and showed that its author had advanced considerably in baseness.</t2914>
<t2915>He pondered over the letter for a while with angry astonishment; then he read it again and again; but each assessment only increased his disgust for the man, and his feelings about him became so bitter that he saw their separation not as the loss of a possible good, but as the escape from the most terrible and insoluble evil, from a lifelong companionship with a man without principles, as the truest peace and the greatest grace, and he refrained from speaking to avoid wounding Marianne even more deeply.</t2915>
<t2916>While pondering over the content of the letter, the immorality of the mind that could write such content, and the very different mind of a very different person who likely had no connection to the matter other than what Elinor's heart had created regarding the events, she forgot her sister's current sorrow, forgot that she had three more unread letters in her lap, and even forgot how long she had been in the room so much that when she heard a carriage approaching the door and went to the window to see who could have come at such an inappropriately early hour, she saw Mrs. Jennings' carriage in astonishment - she knew it was not expected before one o'clock.</t2916> <t2917>Determined not to leave her sister alone, even though she was not yet hopeful that she could comfort Marianne, she hurried to ask Mrs. Jennings' pardon for not accompanying her, citing her sister's indisposition.</t2917> <t2918>Mrs. Jennings, receiving this reason with kindly interest, immediately forgave her, and after Elinor saw her off, she returned to Marianne; she found Marianne trying to get out of bed and just managed to catch her in time to prevent her from falling; she was weak and dizzy from long fasting and sleeplessness, for she had last eaten days ago and had not slept properly for several nights; now, as her mind was no longer supported by the fire of suspicion, all this resulted in a headache, a weakened stomach, and general nervous weakness.</t2918> <t2919>A</t2919>
<t2920>The glass of wine relaxed her a bit, and Marianne finally became able to respond to his affection, saying,</t2920>
<t2921>"Poor Elinor! How unhappy I am making you!"</t2921><t2922>"</t2922>
<t2923>"I wish," her sister replied, "there was something I could do to comfort you."</t2923><t2924>"</t2924>
<t2925>This, like everything else, weighed heavily on Marianne; she could only cry out, amidst the pain in her heart, "Oh Elinor, I am truly finished," before her voice was completely lost in sobs.</t2925>
<t2926>Elinor could no longer remain a spectator to this irresistible torrent of grief.</t2926>
<t2927>"Try, dear Marianne," he cried, "or you will kill yourself and those who love you.</t2927> <t2928>Think of your mother; think of her sorrow while you suffer; try for her sake.</t2928><t2929>"</t2929>
<t2930>"I can't help it," cried Marianne; "if I am overwhelming you, let me go, let me go; leave me, hate me, forget me; but don't torture me like this.</t2930> <t2931>Oh, how easy it is to say 'make an effort' for those who have no sorrows!</t2931> <t2932>Happy Elinor, how will you ever know what I have been through.</t2932><t2933>"</t2933>
<t2934>"Are you calling me happy, Marianne?</t2934> <t2935>Oh! If only you knew! -And you think I could be happy seeing you in such a miserable state!</t2935><t2936>"</t2936>
<t2937>"Forgive, forgive," she wrapped her arms around her sister's neck; "I know what you feel for me; I know what kind of heart you have; but still, you -you must be happy; Edward loves you -what could destroy such happiness?</t2937><t2938>"</t2938>
<t2939>"Many, many reasons," said Elinor with dignity.</t2939>
<t2940>"No, no, no," cried Marianne wildly, "she loves you, only you.</t2940> <t2941>You cannot suffer.</t2941><t2942>"</t2942>
<t2943>"I can't feel good while seeing you like this.</t2943><t2944>"</t2944>
<t2945>"You will never see me in another state.</t2945> <t2946>Mine is a misery that nothing can alleviate.</t2946><t2947>"</t2947>
<t2948>"You shouldn't talk like this, Marianne.</t2948> <t2949>Don't you have anything to console yourself with?</t2949> <t2950>Don't you have any relatives?</t2950> <t2951>Is your loss of the kind that allows no consolation?</t2951> <t2952>Even if you are suffering greatly now, just think, what if you had learned about his character at a later time - if his words had continued for months until he decided to end it, which they could have.</t2952> <t2953>Every new day you spent in baseless trust would have made the blow more terrible.</t2953><t2954>"</t2954>
<t2955>"Promise!" Marianne shouted, "there was no promise.</t2955><t2956>"</t2956>
<t2957>"How could there be no words!</t2957><t2958>"</t2958>
<t2959>"He wasn't as vulgar as you thought he was.</t2959> <t2960>He never broke any promise he made to me.</t2960><t2961>"</t2961>
<t2962>"But did he say he loves you?"</t2962><t2963>"-</t2963>
<t2964>"Yes -no -not exactly.</t2964> <t2965>It was implied every day, but it was never said explicitly.</t2965> <t2966>Sometimes it felt like it was said -but it wasn't.</t2966><t2967>"</t2967>
<t2968>"You still wrote to him?"-</t2968>
<t2969>"Yes -after all that, could this be wrong?</t2969> <t2970>-But I won't be able to talk.</t2970><t2971>"</t2971>
<t2972>Elinor didn't say anything else; she turned to the three letters, which now aroused a much stronger curiosity than before, and read them all from start to finish.</t2972> <t2973>The first letter her sister sent when they came to the city was as follows.</t2973>
<t2974>Berkeley Street, January</t2974>
<t2975>How surprised you will be to receive this letter, Willoughby; I think you will feel more than just surprise when you learn that I am in town.</t2975> <t2976>Even though it is with Mrs. Jennings, the opportunity to come here was an enticement I could not resist.</t2976> <t2977>I hope this letter reaches you in time so that you come here tonight, but I doubt it.</t2977> <t2978>I am definitely expecting you tomorrow.</t2978> <t2979>Goodbye for now.</t2979>
<t2980>M.</t2980> <t2981>D.</t2981>
<t2982>The second letter written the morning after the dance at the Middletons' read as follows:-</t2982>
<t2983>"I cannot express the disappointment I felt for missing you the other day, nor the astonishment I felt for not receiving a reply to the note I sent you more than a week ago.</t2983> <t2984>I hope to hear from you every hour of the day, moreover, I hope to see you.</t2984> <t2985>I beg you to come by at the first opportunity and explain why I have been waiting in vain for so long.</t2985> <t2986>It would be better if you come earlier next time, because we leave around one o'clock.</t2986> <t2987>We were at Lady Middleton's last night, there was a dance.</t2987> <t2988>I was told that you were also invited.</t2988> <t2989>But how can it be?</t2989> <t2990>You must have changed a lot since we last parted, because otherwise it would have been impossible for you not to be there.</t2990> <t2991>But I cannot accept that this is possible; I expect you to personally reassure me that it is not so.</t2991><t2992>"</t2992>
<t2993>M.</t2993> <t2994>D.</t2994>
<t2995>The content of the last letter he wrote to her was as follows: —</t2995>
<t2996>"How should I interpret your behavior last night, Willoughby?</t2996> <t2997>I demand an explanation once again.</t2997> <t2998>I was preparing to welcome you with the longing naturally created by our separation and the warmth justified by our closeness at Barton.</t2998> <t2999>I was utterly defeated!</t2999> <t3000>I spent a miserable night trying to find an excuse for behavior that was nothing short of an insult; but although I haven't yet found a reasonable excuse for my behavior, I am wholeheartedly ready to listen to your explanation.</t3000> <t3001>Perhaps you received incorrect information or were deliberately misled about something concerning me, which may have caused you to lose respect for me.</t3001> <t3002>Tell me what happened, explain why you behaved this way, and let me be satisfied by seeing that I can satisfy you.</t3002> <t3003>It will pain me to be forced to think badly of you; but if necessary, if I need to learn that the person we have known until now is not who you are, that your closeness to us was insincere, and your interest in me was just deception, then let it be said as soon as possible.</t3003> <t3004>My feelings are still in terrible uncertainty; I want to exonerate you, but whatever happens, clarifying the situation is better than the pain I am currently enduring.</t3004> <t3005>If your feelings are no longer the same, return the letters and the lock of hair that belong to me.</t3005><t3006>"</t3006>
<t3007>M.</t3007> <t3008>D.</t3008>
<t3009>Elinor could hardly believe that such loving and trusting letters could have been answered in Willoughby's name.</t3009> <t3010>But her disapproval did not prevent her from seeing the impropriety of their having been written; she silently lamented the imprudence that endangered these proofs of unrequited affection, which nothing that had happened before justified and which the recent events had severely punished, when Marianne, seeing that she had finished the letters, told her that there was nothing in them that anyone in the same situation would not have written.</t3010>
<t3011>"I felt," he added, "as committed to her as if the strictest legal contract had bound us together."</t3011><t3012>"</t3012>
<t3013>"I can believe that," said Elinor; "but unfortunately, he does not feel the same way."</t3013><t3014>"</t3014>
<t3015>"Elinor, he felt the same way - for weeks and weeks he felt it.</t3015> <t3016>I know this.</t3016> <t3017>Whatever has changed him now (nothing but the darkest magic done to me could have achieved this), I was as valuable to him as I could wish for.</t3017> <t3018>This lock of hair, which he now so easily gave up, was begged and pleaded for from me.</t3018> <t3019>If you had seen his look, his demeanor, heard his voice at that moment! Have you forgotten the last evening we were together in Barton?</t3019> <t3020>Especially the morning we parted!</t3020> <t3021>His sorrow when he told me it might be weeks before we met again - is there any way I could forget that sorrow!</t3021><t3022>"</t3022>
<t3023>For a minute or two, he couldn't say anything; but when this feeling passed, he added in a firmer voice,</t3023>
<t3024>"Elinor, they treated me cruelly, but not Willoughby.</t3024><t3025>"</t3025>
<t3026>"Dear Marianne, who else could it be?</t3026> <t3027>Who could have encouraged it?</t3027><t3028>"</t3028>
<t3029>"Except for his own heart, the whole world.</t3029> <t3030>I could believe that everyone I know conspired to make me fall from his grace, but I cannot believe that such cruelty exists in his nature.</t3030> <t3031>The woman he spoke of - whoever she is - or well, everyone, except you, my mother, and Edward, have slandered me barbarously.</t3031> <t3032>Besides the three of you, is there anyone in the world from whom I would not expect evil, other than Willoughby, whom I know so well?</t3032><t3033>"</t3033>
<t3034>Elinor did not engage in the argument, she simply said; "Whoever it is that acts with vile enmity towards you, let them, dear brother, see how nobly you bear your innocence and good intentions, and let them be left with the futility of their own malicious triumphs.</t3034> <t3035>Pride that stands against such treachery is commendable.</t3035><t3036>"</t3036>
<t3037>"No, no," cried Marianne, "there can be no pride in a misery like mine.</t3037> <t3038>Let whoever wants to learn that I am wretched.</t3038> <t3039>The triumph of seeing me like this can be open to the whole world.</t3039> <t3040>Elinor, Elinor, those who suffer little can be as proud and free as they wish - they can resist insult, return evil - but I cannot.</t3040> <t3041>I must feel - I must be wretched - let anyone who wishes enjoy how I bear it.</t3041><t3042>"</t3042>
<t3043>"But for my mother's sake, for my sake" If I could, I would do more.</t3043> <t3044>But to appear happy while being so miserable - who would want this?</t3044><t3045>"</t3045>
<t3046>They fell silent again.</t3046> <t3047>Elinor began to walk thoughtfully between the fireplace and the window, without realizing that she was receiving warmth from one and seeing objects through the other; Marianne, who was sitting at the foot of the bed with her head resting against one of the bedposts, took Willoughby's letter again and, after trembling over each sentence, exclaimed-</t3047>
<t3048>"This is too much!</t3048> <t3049>Oh Willoughby, could this be yours!</t3049> <t3050>Cruel, cruel - nothing can exonerate you.</t3050> <t3051>Elinor, nothing can exonerate him.</t3051> <t3052>No matter what he might have heard against me - shouldn't he have waited before believing it?</t3052> <t3053>Shouldn't he have told me first, given me a chance to defend myself?</t3053> <t3054>‘The lock of hair you kindly bestowed upon me’ This is not forgivable.</t3054> <t3055>Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote these words?</t3055> <t3056>Oh, this is barbaric rudeness!</t3056> <t3057>-Elinor, is there any defense for this?</t3057><t3058>"</t3058>
<t3059>"No Marianne, never.</t3059><t3060>"</t3060>
<t3061>"But this woman - who knows what talents she has - how long must she have been planned, how deeply must she have been schemed by this woman!</t3061> <t3062>-Who is this?</t3062> <t3063>-Who could it be?</t3063> <t3064>-Among the women he knows, who did you hear him mention as young and attractive?</t3064> <t3065>-Oh, no one, no one - he only talked about me.</t3065><t3066>"</t3066>
<t3067>Another silence fell; Marianne was extremely excited, and the silence ended like this.</t3067>
<t3068>"Elinor, I need to go home.</t3068> <t3069>I need to go and comfort my mother.</t3069> <t3070>Can't we go tomorrow?</t3070><t3071>"</t3071>
<t3072>"Tomorrow, Marianne!"</t3072><t3073>"</t3073>
<t3074>"Yes, why should I stay here?</t3074> <t3075>I only came for Willoughby's sake - now who cares about me?</t3075> <t3076>Who cares about me?</t3076><t3077>"</t3077>
<t3078>"It will be impossible to leave tomorrow.</t3078> <t3079>We owe Mrs. Jennings more than just courtesy; even the most basic politeness would not permit such a hasty departure.</t3079><t3080>"</t3080>
<t3081>"Alright then, maybe for a day or two more; but I can't stay here long, I can't endure all these people's questions and remarks.</t3081> <t3082>The Middletons, the Palmers - how will I endure their pity?</t3082> <t3083>The pity of a woman like Lady Middleton!</t3083> <t3084>Ah, what would Willoughby say to this!</t3084><t3085>"</t3085>
<t3086>Elinor advised her to lie down again, and she did lie down for a bit; but no matter what she did, she couldn't find comfort; in a restless state of mind and body, she kept changing her position every now and then, until she became increasingly hysterical; her sister could barely keep her in bed, even fearing for a while that she might have to call for help.</t3086> <t3087>However, in the end, she managed to persuade her to take a few drops of lavender; the lavender worked well; after that, she lay in bed calm and still until Mrs. Jennings returned.</t3087>
<t3088>When Mrs. Jennings returned, she immediately came to my room and, without waiting for permission to be granted, opened the door and entered with an expression of genuine concern.</t3088>
<t3089>"How are you, my dear?" - he said to Marianne in a voice full of affection; Marianne turned her face away without attempting to reply.</t3089>
<t3090>"How is she, Miss Dashwood? -Poor thing! She looks terrible.</t3090> <t3091>-No wonder.</t3091> <t3092>It was true.</t3092> <t3093>She is getting married very soon -to a worthless man!</t3093> <t3094>He has completely fallen from my favor.</t3094> <t3095>Mrs. Taylor told me half an hour ago, and she heard it from a close friend of Miss Grey herself, otherwise I would never have believed it; I almost fainted on the spot.</t3095> <t3096>All I can say is, if it's true, he has wronged a young lady I know; with all my heart, I hope his wife makes his life miserable.</t3096> <t3097>I will always say that, my dear, believe me.</t3097> <t3098>I will not tolerate men behaving this way; if I ever see him again, I will give him such a scolding that he will remember it.</t3098> <t3099>But there is something to console you, dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only man in the world; with such a beautiful face, you will never be short of admirers.</t3099> <t3100>Oh, poor thing!</t3100> <t3101>I won't bother her any longer, it's better for her to cry it out as soon as possible.</t3101> <t3102>Fortunately, the Parrys and the Sandersons are coming this evening; that will cheer her up.</t3102><t3103>"</t3103>
<t3104>Then he left the room, walking on tiptoe as if he thought the pain of his young friend would increase with sound.</t3104>
<t3105>Marianne surprised her sister by deciding to have dinner with them.</t3105> <t3106>Even Elinor had opposed this.</t3106> <t3107>But "no, she would go down; she would control herself, then the noise around her would diminish.</t3107><t3108>"</t3108> <t3109>Elinor, pleased that she had heeded such an impulse even for a moment, said nothing else, though she doubted Marianne could endure through the entire meal; while Marianne lay in bed, she adjusted her dress as best as she could and helped her down to the dining room when they were called.</t3109>
<t3110>Although he looked quite miserable in the dining room, he ate more than his sister expected and behaved more calmly.</t3110> <t3111>If he had tried to speak or noticed the well-meaning but inappropriate interest Mrs. Jennings showed him, he would not have been able to maintain this calmness; but not a single syllable escaped his lips, and the distance of his thoughts kept him unaware of what was happening in front of him, thus protecting him.</t3111>
<t3112>Although Elinor often found Mrs. Jennings' words annoying and sometimes almost ridiculous, she appreciated her kindness and gave her the responses her sister could not, and the thanks she could not express.</t3112> <t3113>The kind-hearted friend saw that Marianne was unhappy and ensured that everything that could alleviate her unhappiness was offered to her.</t3113> <t3114>Thus, she showed her the attention of a mother spoiling her favorite child on the last day of the holiday.</t3114> <t3115>She wanted Marianne to sit in the best spot by the fireplace, to be persuaded to eat all the delicious food in the house, and to be entertained with all the news of the day.</t3115> <t3116>If Elinor had not seen a resistance to any kind of joy on her sister's sorrowful face, Mrs. Jennings' efforts to cure her disappointment in love with sweets, olives, and a good fire in the hearth might have been successful.</t3116> <t3117>Yet, when all these were repeatedly forced upon her attention, Marianne could no longer stay.</t3117> <t3118>With a frantic cry of distress and a gesture to her sister not to follow her, she immediately got up and rushed out of the room.</t3118>
<t3119>"Poor thing!" said Mrs. Jennings as soon as he left, "It makes me so sad to see him like this!</t3119> <t3120>Moreover, he left without finishing his wine!</t3120> <t3121>He didn't eat any of the dried cherries either!</t3121> <t3122>My God! Nothing helps.</t3122> <t3123>If I knew something that would please him, I would turn the city upside down to find it.</t3123> <t3124>I mean, the strangest thing is a man treating such a beautiful girl so badly!</t3124> <t3125>But of course, when one side has a lot of money and the other doesn't, you know how it is!</t3125> <t3126>No one cares about such things anymore!-"</t3126>
<t3127>"That lady -you said Miss Grey, right- is she very rich?</t3127><t3128>"</t3128>
<t3129>"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.</t3129> <t3130>Have you ever seen her?</t3130> <t3131>They say she's smart and tasteful, but not beautiful.</t3131> <t3132>I remember her aunt well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man.</t3132> <t3133>But the whole family is already rich.</t3133> <t3134>Fifty thousand pounds! And it came at such a timely moment; because, according to what they say, the man was desperate for money.</t3134> <t3135>Of course he was!</t3135> <t3136>He's flaunting around with his carriage and hunters!</t3136> <t3137>I mean, there's no point in talking, but when a young man, whoever he may be, flirts with a beautiful girl, promises to marry her, and then just because he fell into poverty and there's a rich girl ready to marry him, he doesn't have the right to break his promise.</t3137> <t3138>If that's the case, why doesn't he sell his horses, his house, dismiss his servants, and completely change his life?</t3138> <t3139>I think Miss Marianne would have waited until things got better.</t3139> <t3140>But that's not done anymore; young men of this age don't give up any of their pleasures."</t3140>
<t3141>"Do you know what kind of girl Miss Grey is?</t3141> <t3142>Is she a nice person?</t3142><t3143>"</t3143>
<t3144>"I haven't heard anything bad about her; in fact, I haven't even heard her name, but this morning Mrs. Taylor said that one day Miss Walker told her Mr. and Mrs. Ellison wouldn't be sorry to see Miss Grey married off, because they couldn't get along with Mrs. Ellison at all."</t3144>
<t3145>"Who are the Ellisons?</t3145><t3146>"</t3146>
<t3147>"Vasileri, my dear.</t3147> <t3148>But now she is of age, she can make her own choices; what a marvelous choice she made though! - Anyway," after a moment's pause, "your poor sister has probably gone to her room to lament by herself.</t3148> <t3149>Isn't there something that can be done to comfort her?</t3149> <t3150>Poor girl, it feels cruel to leave her alone.</t3150> <t3151>Anyway, we'll gradually find a few friends, she'll be somewhat distracted. What shall we play?</t3151> <t3152>She doesn't like Whist; but isn't there any game she likes?</t3152><t3153>"</t3153>
<t3154>"Madam, this courtesy is really unnecessary.</t3154> <t3155>Marianne probably won't come out of her room again tonight.</t3155> <t3156>If I can manage, I will persuade her to go to bed early, because I think she needs rest.</t3156><t3157>"</t3157>
<t3158>"Yes, I think this would be the best for him.</t3158> <t3159>Let him eat whatever he wants and rest.</t3159> <t3160>My God! It's no wonder he has looked so bad, so worn out for the last couple of weeks, because this issue has clearly been bothering him for so long.</t3160> <t3161>So, the letter that arrived today finished it off!</t3161> <t3162>Poor thing!</t3162> <t3163>If I had known, I would never have joked with him about this matter.</t3163> <t3164>But I mean, how could I have thought of such a thing?</t3164> <t3165>I was sure it was just a love letter, and besides, young people like such jokes.</t3165> <t3166>My God! How worried Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear!</t3166> <t3167>If I had been in my right mind, I would have stopped by Conduit Street on my way home and told them.</t3167> <t3168>But now, I will see them tomorrow.</t3168><t3169>"</t3169>
<t3170>"I am sure it will be unnecessary to warn Mrs. Palmer and Sir John not to mention Mr. Willoughby's name or talk about what happened in front of my sister.</t3170> <t3171>Their own sensitivities will tell them the true cruelty of appearing aware of the matter in her presence; and as you, dear Madam, will easily understand, the less that is said to me about it, the more at ease I will feel."</t3171>
<t3172>"My God! Yes, of course it would be.</t3172> <t3173>Hearing it mentioned must be terrible for you; as for your sister, I will never say a word to her about it.</t3173> <t3174>You saw, I didn't mention it throughout the entire meal.</t3174> <t3175>Sir John and my daughters won't mention it either; because they are all very thoughtful and understanding, especially after I give them the signal, which I will.</t3175> <t3176>For my part, the less said about such a thing, the better, the sooner it is forgotten. Besides, when has talking ever helped?</t3176><t3177>"</t3177>
<t3178>"Speaking on this matter can only cause harm; perhaps even more so than in similar situations, because in this case, for the sake of everyone involved, there are circumstances that make it inappropriate to spread around. I must be fair to Mr. Willoughby in at least one regard - he has not broken any promises he made to my sister."</t3178><t3179>"</t3179>
<t3180>"Justice, my dear! Don’t pretend to defend it.</t3180> <t3181>He supposedly didn’t promise!</t3181> <t3182>After taking her all the way to Allenham House and choosing the rooms where they would live forever?</t3182><t3183>"</t3183>
<t3184>Elinor could not pursue the matter further for her sister's sake; and she hoped she did not need to for Willoughby's sake, because while Marianne had much to lose from the truth being emphasized, there was not much for Willoughby to gain.</t3184> <t3185>After both parties remained silent for a short while, Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural cheerfulness, pressed on again.</t3185>
<t3186>"Well, my dear, there is a silver lining in every cloud, because it will be good for Colonel Brandon.</t3186> <t3187>In the end, he will win her heart, believe me.</t3187> <t3188>Just wait and see, won't they be married by mid-summer.</t3188> <t3189>Absolutely! How happy he will be with this news!</t3189> <t3190>Hopefully, he will come tonight.</t3190> <t3191>It will be a better match for your sister.</t3191> <t3192>Two thousand pounds a year, no debts - except for the little love child, of course; oh look, I forgot about that; but it can be settled somewhere with little expense, what harm will it do?</t3192> <t3193>Delaford is a beautiful place; the old style is so lovely, with all kinds of comforts and amenities; covered with the best fruit trees in the country, behind large garden walls; there's such a mulberry tree in one corner!</t3193> <t3194>My God! We went once with Charlotte, how we stuffed ourselves!</t3194> <t3195>Then there's a dovecote, a few exquisite fish ponds, and a very nice water channel; everything to one's heart's content; also close to the church; only a quarter mile away through the turnstile path, so one never gets bored; because if you sit in the old yew grove behind the house, you see all the carriages passing by.</t3195> <t3196>Oh, what a sweet place!</t3196> <t3197>There's a butcher right in the village, and the parsonage is just a stone's throw away.</t3197> <t3198>To me, it's a thousand times more beautiful than Barton Park, where they send someone three miles away to get meat, and they don't have a closer neighbor than your mother.</t3198> <t3199>Well, I will make Colonel Brandon happy at the first opportunity.</t3199> <t3200>Hope springs eternal, as they say.</t3200> <t3201>If only we could get Willoughby out of Marianne's head!</t3201><t3202>"</t3202>
<t3203>"If we could just manage this, ma'am," said Elinor, "Colonel Brandon wouldn't be necessary."</t3203> <t3204>Then she got up and went to Marianne; as she expected, she found Marianne in her own room, leaning against the fireplace in silent sorrow, staring at the small ember left from the fire; until Elinor entered, this ember was her only light.</t3204>
<t3205>"It would be better if you left me alone," was the only response his sister could get from him.</t3205>
<t3206>"I will leave you alone," said Elinor, "but only if you lie down."</t3206> <t3207>Marianne initially refused this with the impatience and irritability of someone in pain.</t3207> <t3208>However, her sister's persistent yet gentle persuasion softened and calmed her; before Elinor left her side, she saw Marianne rest her aching head on the pillow and hoped she would get some rest.</t3208> <t3209>'</t3209>
<t3210>When she returned to the living room, Mrs. Jennings immediately came to her with a glass filled with something in her hand.</t3210>
<t3211>"My dear," he said as he entered the room, "it just occurred to me, I had some excellent old Constantia wine at home, I brought a glass for your sister.</t3211> <t3212>Poor husband! How much he loved this!</t3212> <t3213>Whenever that notorious gout attack seemed to come, he used to say that this did him more good than anything else.</t3213> <t3214>Take this to your sister.</t3214><t3215>"</t3215>
<t3216>"Dear Madam," replied Elinor, smiling at the difference in complaints for which wine was recommended, "how kind you are!</t3216> <t3217>But I have just put Marianne to bed and I hope she is already asleep; since rest will do her the most good, if you don't mind, I will drink the wine myself.</t3217><t3218>"</t3218>
<t3219>Although Mrs. Jennings was sorry that she had not arrived five minutes earlier, she was pleased with the arrangement; while Elinor was drinking the wine, its positive effects on gout did not mean much to her at the time, but she thought that its healing effects on a disappointed heart could be tried on herself as well as on her sister.</t3219>
<t3220>While the group was having tea, Colonel Brandon arrived and, by looking around and calling for Marianne, Elinor immediately understood that he neither hoped nor wanted to see her there, in short, he already knew the reason for her absence.</t3220> <t3221>Mrs. Jennings did not share the same thought; for upon entering the room, she immediately went to the tea table where Elinor was sitting and whispered in her ear, "The Colonel looks serious as usual. He doesn't know; tell him, dear."</t3221><t3222>"</t3222>
<t3223>Colonel Brandon pulled a chair next to Elinor and asked about her sister's well-being with a look that convinced her he was well-informed about everything.</t3223>
<t3224>"Marianne is not well," said Elinor.</t3224> <t3225>"She was unwell all day, we persuaded her to go to bed.</t3225><t3226>"</t3226>
<t3227>"Then perhaps," replied Colonel Brandon, "what I heard this morning - I didn't think it was likely at first, but it might be true.</t3227><t3228>"</t3228>
<t3229>"What did you hear?</t3229><t3230>"</t3230>
<t3231>"A gentleman, according to my correct guess - well, a man, someone I know to be engaged - but how should I put it?</t3231> <t3232>If you already know, which you surely do, please excuse me.</t3232><t3233>"</t3233>
<t3234>"What you mean," replied Elinor, barely restraining herself, "is Mr. Willoughby's marriage to Miss Grey.</t3234> <t3235>Yes, we all know that.</t3235> <t3236>Today seems to be a day of general enlightenment, because it was first announced to us this morning.</t3236> <t3237>Mr. Willoughby is quite something!</t3237> <t3238>Where did you hear it?</t3238><t3239>"</t3239>
<t3240>"I had stopped by a stationery shop in Pall Mall for business.</t3240> <t3241>Two ladies were waiting for their carriages, and one was telling the other about a planned marriage in a voice that made it impossible for me not to hear, as she wasn't trying to hide it at all.</t3241> <t3242>The name Willoughby, John Willoughby, was repeated so often that it caught my attention; the rest confirmed that everything regarding his marriage to Miss Grey was now finalized - it would no longer be kept secret - it would even take place within a few weeks, detailing the preparations and other matters.</t3242> <t3243>However, I remember one thing because it helped me identify the man better: - they would go to Combe Magna, his place in Somersetshire, immediately after the ceremony.</t3243> <t3244>I was very surprised!</t3244> <t3245>It is impossible for me to describe what I felt.</t3245> <t3246>I waited in the shop until they left and learned when I asked that the talkative lady was someone named Mrs. Elison, and I also learned that this was the name of Miss Grey's guardian.</t3246><t3247>"</t3247>
<t3248>"That's right.</t3248> <t3249>But did you also learn that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds?</t3249> <t3250>We might find an explanation at this point.</t3250><t3251>"</t3251>
<t3252>"It may be; but Willoughby is such a man that - at least to me" - she paused for a moment; then added in a voice that seemed unsure of itself, "Your sister - how could she be involved in such a-"</t3252>
<t3253>"She suffered a lot.</t3253> <t3254>All I can do is hope it doesn't last long.</t3254> <t3255>It was a very cruel blow.</t3255> <t3256>Until yesterday, I think she didn't doubt his love; even now, maybe - but I am inclined to believe that Willoughby never truly committed to her.</t3256> <t3257>He deceived her!</t3257> <t3258>In some ways, he also seems heartless.</t3258><t3259>"</t3259>
<t3260>"Yes!" said Colonel Brandon, "It is so, indeed!</t3260> <t3261>But your sister - I believe you said so - doesn't see the matter exactly as you do?</t3261><t3262>"</t3262>
<t3263>"You know his nature; if he had the chance, you can understand how ready he is to justify himself."</t3263><t3264>"</t3264>
<t3265>Colonel Brandon did not respond, and shortly after, with the removal of the tea set and the arrangement of the paper groups, the subject was necessarily closed.</t3265> <t3266>Mrs. Jennings, who watched them with pleasure as they talked and hoped to see that Miss Dashwood's words had a joyful effect on Colonel Brandon as if he were a man in the prime of youth, hope, and happiness, was surprised to see that he remained more serious and thoughtful than ever throughout the evening.</t3266>
<t3267>After a night more sleepless than she had hoped, Marianne woke up the next morning with the same sorrowful mood she had when she closed her eyes at night.</t3267>
<t3268>Elinor encouraged her to talk about her feelings as much as possible; before breakfast was prepared, just like before, Elinor, with the same unwavering belief and affectionate mentorship, and Marianne, with the same hasty emotions and changeable ideas, had gone over the matter again and again.</t3268> <t3269>Sometimes Marianne believed that Willoughby was as unfortunate and innocent as she was, and sometimes she lost all comfort in the face of the impossibility of exonerating him.</t3269> <t3270>One moment she was absolutely indifferent to what the whole world said, then another moment she isolated herself from the world forever, and the next moment she could fiercely oppose the world.</t3270> <t3271>She was consistent in only one point; when necessary, she avoided Mrs. Jennings' presence if possible, and if not, she endured it in determined silence.</t3271> <t3272>Her heart had hardened against the belief that Mrs. Jennings would cruelly interfere with her sorrow.</t3272>
<t3273>"No, no, no, it can't be," he cried; "he can't feel it.</t3273> <t3274>His politeness is not kindness; his good nature is not compassion.</t3274> <t3275>All he wants is gossip, he loves me only because I am material for him."</t3275>
<t3276>Elinor knew this even before hearing these words; her sister often judged others unfairly because she placed too much importance on the subtleties of a strong passion and the charms of an exaggerated style, due to the meticulous sensitivity of her own soul.</t3276> <t3277>Like the other half of the world, if the intelligent and good are not more than half, Marianne, despite her extraordinary talents and remarkable personality, was neither sensible nor sincere.</t3277> <t3278>She expected other people to have the same feelings and thoughts as herself and judged their impulses based on the immediate impact their actions had on her.</t3278> <t3279>While the sisters were sitting in their rooms after breakfast, such a situation arose that greatly lowered Mrs. Jennings in her eyes; because due to her own weakness, she turned the situation into a new source of pain; whereas Mrs. Jennings was acting out of a great impulse of goodwill.</t3279>
<t3280>With a letter in his outstretched hand, his face beaming with the joy of bringing good news, he entered their rooms and said,</t3280>
<t3281>"Here you go, my dear, I brought something that I'm sure will be very good for you."</t3281><t3282>"</t3282>
<t3283>Marianne had heard enough.</t3283> <t3284>In an instant, her imagination presented her with a letter from Willoughby, filled with love and remorse, explaining everything that had happened in a satisfactory and convincing manner, and immediately after, it brought Willoughby himself, bursting into the room with enthusiasm, kneeling before her, supporting the apologies in his letter with the expression in his eyes.</t3284> <t3285>A momentary fantasy collapsed in the next moment.</t3285> <t3286>In front of her was her mother's handwriting, which had never before disturbed her peace.</t3286> <t3287>She felt that she had never experienced such a sharp disappointment following an exhilaration that surpassed hope until that moment.</t3287>
<t3288>No language could capture Mrs. Jennings' cruelty at her most fervent moments of speech; yet now she could only reproach her with tears streaming from her eyes in passionate intensity - which, however, was a reproach that her target did not take to heart at all, so much so that after many expressions of pity, Mrs. Jennings still left, saying that the letter would comfort her.</t3288> <t3289>However, when she calmed down enough to read the letter, it brought her very little comfort.</t3289> <t3290>Every page was filled with Willoughby.</t3290> <t3291>His mother still believed they were engaged, trusted in Willoughby's loyalty as fervently as ever; it was Elinor's letter inviting Marianne to be more open with both of them that had moved her; her affection for Marianne, her love for Willoughby, and her belief in their happy future were so great that she had cried in pain while reading the letter.</t3291>
<t3292>Marianne's impatience to be at home returned; she loved her mother more than ever; she loved her more because of the same excessiveness with which she had wrongly trusted Willoughby, and she stubbornly insisted on leaving.</t3292> <t3293>Elinor, unable to decide for herself whether it would be better for Marianne to be in London or Barton, could only advise her to wait until they learned their mother's preference; in the end, she got her sister's approval to wait for that news.</t3293>
<t3294>Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual because she could not be at ease unless the Middletons and the Palmers were as upset as she was; she absolutely refused Elinor's offer to accompany her and went out alone to spend the rest of the day outside.</t3294> <t3295>With a heavy heart, aware of the pain she would cause and that she had failed to lay the groundwork according to Marianne's letter, she sat down to write to her mother about what had happened and to ask for further instructions; meanwhile, Marianne, who had come into the sitting room because Mrs. Jennings had left, stood by the table where Elinor was writing, watching the progress of her pen, feeling sorry for her for the difficulty of such a task, and deeply sympathizing with her mother for the impact of the letter.</t3295>
<t3296>They continued in this manner for about a quarter of an hour; then Marianne, whose nerves could not yet handle sudden noises, was startled when the door was knocked.</t3296>
<t3297>"Who could it be?" said Elinor.</t3297> <t3298>"It's too early!</t3298> <t3299>I thought we were safe."</t3299><t3300>"</t3300>
<t3301>Marianne went to the window.</t3301> <t3302>—</t3302>
<t3303>"Colonel Brandon!" he said, with distress.</t3303> <t3304>"We can never be safe against him.</t3304><t3305>"</t3305>
<t3306>"He won't come in, Mrs. Jennings isn't home."</t3306><t3307>"</t3307>
<t3308>"I can't be sure of that," he said, heading to his room.</t3308> <t3309>"A man with nothing to do keeps meddling heartlessly in others' affairs.</t3309><t3310>"</t3310>
<t3311>The incident proved her prediction correct, even though her prediction was based on injustice and error; Colonel Brandon entered; Elinor, who thought he was brought there by his concern for Marianne and saw this concern in his troubled and sorrowful appearance and in his brief but interested inquiry about her health, could not help but resent her sister for taking him so lightly.</t3311>
<t3312>"I ran into Mrs. Jennings on Bond Street," he said, after the initial greetings, "she encouraged me to come; in truth, I was quickly encouraged, because I thought I might find you alone, which is what I wanted.</t3312> <t3313>My purpose - my wish - my only wish - I hope, I mean I believe - is to provide comfort; - no, not comfort - not current comfort - but to understand, to make your sister understand.</t3313> <t3314>Allow me to prove my respect for her, for you, for your mother - by explaining some events, purely out of a very sincere respect - purely out of a genuine desire to be helpful -.</t3314> <t3315>I believe I am doing the right thing - although it took me hours to convince myself that I was justified, is there no reason to fear that I might be wrong."</t3315> <t3316>He paused.</t3316>
<t3317>"I understand you," said Elinor.</t3317> <t3318>"You have something to tell me about Mr. Willoughby, something that will show his character more clearly.</t3318> <t3319>Sharing this would be the greatest kindness you could do for Marianne.</t3319> <t3320>Any information with this purpose will make me immediately grateful, and Marianne's gratitude will be earned over time. Please, please tell me.</t3320><t3321>"</t3321>
<t3322>"I will tell you; briefly, when I left Barton last October, -but this gives you no idea -I must go further back.</t3322> <t3323>I am a very clumsy narrator, Miss Dashwood; I don't even know where to begin.</t3323> <t3324>I think it will be necessary to briefly recount my own past, and it will be brief.</t3324> <t3325>On such a matter," with a deep sigh, "I cannot feel the desire to be detailed.</t3325><t3326>"</t3326>
<t3327>He paused for a moment to remember, then continued with a sigh once more.</t3327>
<t3328>"You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation we had one evening at Barton Park - (it was not told to impress you) it was an evening of dancing - I had mentioned a lady I once knew, saying she bore a resemblance to your sister Marianne.</t3328><t3329>"</t3329>
<t3330>"Of course," replied Elinor, "I haven't forgotten."</t3330> <t3331>Colonel Brandon seemed pleased by this recollection and added,</t3331>
<t3332>"The taste of beautiful memories, if the uncertainty does not deceive me, there is a strong resemblance between the two, both in form and spirit.</t3332> <t3333>The same warmth of heart, the same dreaminess and joy.</t3333> <t3334>The lady was one of my closest relatives, she was orphaned as a child and was under my father's guardianship.</t3334> <t3335>We were almost the same age; we played and befriended each other since we were very young.</t3335> <t3336>I do not remember a time when I did not love Eliza; in the years we grew up, my love for her was such that, looking at my current resentful and joyless state, you might doubt that I could have felt it.</t3336> <t3337>I believe her love for me was as passionate as your sister's attachment to Mr. Willoughby, though it stemmed from a different reason, but it was no less unfortunate.</t3337> <t3338>She left my life forever at the age of seventeen.</t3338> <t3339>She married - unwillingly, she married my brother.</t3339> <t3340>Her wealth was great, while our family estate was heavily mortgaged.</t3340> <t3341>This, I fear, is the only thing that can be said about the behavior of someone who was both her uncle and guardian.</t3341> <t3342>My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.</t3342>
<t3343>I was hoping that his love for me would keep him standing in any situation, and it did for a while - but in the end, because he was subjected to great rudeness, the misery of his situation destroyed all his resistance, and although he promised me, how blindly I am explaining it!</t3343><t3344>I did not explain how this came about.</t3344><t3345>There were only a few hours left before we eloped to Scotland.</t3345><t3346>The betrayal or foolishness of my cousin gave us away.</t3346><t3347>I was exiled to the house of a distant relative, and he was deprived of all freedom, people, and entertainment until my father got what he wanted.</t3347><t3348>I had too much confidence in his fortitude, and the blow I received was severe - but if his marriage had been happy, being so young, I could have accepted the situation in a few months or at least I wouldn't have to mourn now.</t3348><t3349>However, that was not the case.</t3349><t3350>My brother did not love him; his sense of pleasure was not as it should be, and he mistreated him from the very beginning.</t3350><t3351>The effect of this on someone as young, lively, and inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon was as expected.</t3351><t3352>At first, she shut herself into the full misery of her situation; I wish she hadn't lived long enough to overcome the sorrows caused by remembering me.</t3352><t3353>But with a husband who incites infidelity, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (my father lived only three months after they married, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies), is it possible to be surprised that she made a mistake?</t3353><t3354>If I had stayed in England, maybe - but by staying away from her for years, I thought I was helping the happiness of both, and for this purpose, I got my assignment.</t3354><t3355>The shock caused by her marriage," he continued, in a very excited voice, "was nothing - it was nothing - compared to what I felt when I heard she was divorced two years later.</t3355><t3356>This was the event that caused this grief, - even now, when I remember what I endured -"</t3356>
<t3357>He couldn't speak any more; he got up hurriedly and walked around the room for a few minutes.</t3357> <t3358>Elinor, affected by what he had said, but even more by his sorrow, couldn't say anything.</t3358> <t3359>Colonel Brandon saw her concern, came over, took her hand, squeezed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.</t3359> <t3360>A few minutes of silent effort allowed him to compose himself and continue.</t3360>
<t3361>"I returned to England almost three years after this unhappy period.</t3361> <t3362>Of course, the first thing I did when I returned was to look for her; but the search was not only fruitless but also distressing.</t3362> <t3363>I lost track of her after her first lover; there was every reason to fear that she had sunk even deeper into a sinful life after leaving the man.</t3363> <t3364>Her legal income was not suitable for her fortune, nor was it sufficient for her to live comfortably; I learned from my brother that the authority to receive this income had been transferred to another person a few months earlier.</t3364> <t3365>My brother thought, quite indifferently, that her extravagance and resulting distress had forced her to urgently dispose of a portion of her income.</t3365> <t3366>But finally, six months after coming to England, I found her.</t3366> <t3367>I went to the debtor's prison to see an old servant of mine who had fallen into destitution and been imprisoned for his debts; there, in the same prison, in a similar state of imprisonment, stood my unfortunate aunt.</t3367> <t3368>She had changed so much due to various sufferings - she had withered - she was worn out!</t3368> <t3369>I could not believe that the sad, sickly person before me was all that was left of the beautiful, young, healthy girl I had once loved.</t3369> <t3370>To bear seeing her like that - but I have no right to hurt your feelings by trying to describe it - I have already distressed you enough.</t3370> <t3371>It was immediately apparent that she was in the final stage of tuberculosis - yes, in such a situation, this was my greatest consolation.</t3371> <t3372>Life could do nothing for her, except give her time to better prepare for death.</t3372> <t3373>I ensured she was placed in a comfortable location and taken care of; I visited her every day for the rest of her short life; I was with her in her final moments.</t3373><t3374>"</t3374>
<t3375>He paused to collect himself again; Elinor expressed her feelings about her unfortunate friend's fate with a sigh full of compassion and pity.</t3375>
<t3376>"I hope I am not being disrespectful to your sister," said Colonel Brandon, "for drawing a comparison between her and my poor, disgraced relative.</t3376><t3377>Their fates, their fortunes cannot be the same; if the natural sweet disposition of one had been protected by a more resolute mind, the other could have achieved everything she could have been throughout her life.</t3377><t3378>But where is all this leading?</t3378><t3379>I seem to be boring you unnecessarily.</t3379><t3380>Oh, Miss Dashwood -such a subject -untouched for fourteen years -even speaking of it is dangerous!</t3380><t3381>I will be more concise -more brief.</t3381><t3382>She entrusted her only child to me, a little girl, the fruit of her first guilty relationship, who was about three years old at the time.</t3382><t3383>She loved the child, never parted from her.</t3383><t3384>She became a precious, important charge for me; if our circumstances had allowed, I would have gladly taken responsibility for her education myself; but I had no family, no home: thus, little Eliza was sent to school.</t3384><t3385>I visited her there at every opportunity, and after my brother's death (he died about five years ago, and the family estate came to me), she often visited me at Delaford.</t3385><t3386>I introduced her as a distant relative; but I am aware that everyone suspected a much closer connection.</t3386><t3387>Three years ago, (she had just turned fourteen) I took her out of school and placed her with a very respectable woman in Dorsetshire who was also caring for four or five other girls of the same age, and for two years I had every reason to be satisfied with her situation.</t3387><t3388>But last February, almost a year ago, she suddenly disappeared.</t3388><t3389>She had insisted on going to Bath with a young friend who was accompanying her father on a health trip, and I had allowed her to go (it later turned out that I had made a mistake).</t3389><t3390>I knew the man very well, and I had good thoughts about the girl -better than she deserved at least, because despite knowing everything, she maintained a stubborn and erroneous secrecy, revealing nothing, giving no clue.</t3390><t3391>Her father, a well-meaning but somewhat naive man, I believe, truly could not provide any information, because he was usually confined to home, while the girls roamed the city, meeting whomever they pleased; the man tried to convince me that his daughter was unaware of the matter, and he himself believed it.</t3391><t3392>In short, I learned nothing except that she had gone; the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.</t3392><t3393>What I thought, what I feared, can be understood; of course, what I suffered as well.</t3393><t3394>"</t3394>
<t3395>"Oh my God!" cried Elinor, "Could it be! Willoughby!"</t3395>
<t3396>"The first news about him," he continued, "came with a letter he wrote himself, last October.</t3396> <t3397>It was forwarded to me from Delaford; I received the letter on the morning of our trip to Whitwell; this was the reason for my sudden departure from Barton; I am sure my departure seemed strange to everyone and offended some.</t3397> <t3398>Mr. Willoughby probably couldn't guess that when his looks condemned me for the rudeness of spoiling the party, I was called to the aid of someone he had impoverished and made miserable; but even if he knew, what good would it do?</t3398> <t3399>Would his cheerfulness fade, would his happiness diminish in the face of your sister's smile?</t3399> <t3400>No, he had already done something that no one who could put themselves in another's place would ever do.</t3400> <t3401>He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced in an extremely distressing situation, homeless, penniless, friendless, without even giving her his address!</t3401> <t3402>He had promised to return to her; he neither returned, nor wrote a letter, nor offered any consolation.</t3402><t3403>"</t3403>
<t3404>"This is unforgivable!" cried Elinor.</t3404>
<t3405>"His character is now before you; selfish, debauched, even worse.</t3405> <t3406>Knowing all this, which I have known for weeks, you can imagine how I must have felt when I saw your sister's interest in him and learned that she was going to marry him; imagine how I must have felt on behalf of all of you.</t3406> <t3407>When I came last week and found you alone, I was determined to learn the truth, though I was uncertain about what I would do once I learned it.</t3407> <t3408>My behavior must have seemed strange to you then; but now you understand.</t3408> <t3409>To see you all so deceived, your sister - but what could I do?</t3409> <t3410>I had no hope of success by intervening; sometimes I thought your sister's strength might bring him to his senses.</t3410> <t3411>But now, after such abuse, who can say what his plans are regarding her?</t3411> <t3412>Whatever his plans were, your sister can now look at her situation with gratitude, which she undoubtedly will, comparing her situation to that of my poor Eliza, imagining the wretched and hopeless state of this poor girl who loved him as strongly as she did, tormented by a lifelong regret.</t3412> <t3413>Of course, this comparison will be beneficial to her.</t3413> <t3414>She will see that her own suffering is nothing.</t3414> <t3415>They did not arise from any abuse, so the result cannot be shameful.</t3415> <t3416>On the contrary, they are things that will make every friend an even closer friend.</t3416> <t3417>The concern for her unhappiness, the respect for her resilience in her misery, will strengthen everyone's attachment to her.</t3417> <t3418>However, the decision to convey what I have told you to her is up to you.</t3418> <t3419>You know best what its effect might be; but if I did not sincerely and earnestly believe that it could be useful, that it could lessen your sorrow, I would not risk burdening you with my family troubles by telling a story that could give the impression that I am trying to elevate myself by denigrating others.</t3419><t3420>"</t3420>
<t3421>This speech was followed by Elinor's grateful, insistent thanks; she also added that she believed recounting the events would be beneficial for Marianne.</t3421>
<t3422>"Most of all," she said, "I am upset about his trying to clear her name; because it disturbs his mind more than the belief that she is worthless.</t3422> <t3423>At first, he will suffer a lot, but I am sure he will feel relieved soon.</t3423> <t3424>Well," she continued, after a short silence, "did you see Mr. Willoughby again after you left Barton?</t3424><t3425>"</t3425>
<t3426>"Yes," Colonel Brandon replied seriously, "I saw her once.</t3426> <t3427>It was inevitable to encounter her once.</t3427><t3428>"</t3428>
<t3429>Elinor, surprised by his demeanor, looked at him anxiously and said,</t3429>
<t3430>"Hey! Did you meet with him for that thing-"</t3430>
<t3431>"I couldn't have encountered him for anything else.</t3431> <t3432>Although Eliza was very stubborn, she revealed her lover's name to me; when Mr. Willoughby returned to the city fifteen days after me, we arranged to meet, he to defend his conduct, and I to punish it.</t3432> <t3433>We both returned uninjured, so the meeting did not spread around.</t3433><t3434>"</t3434>
<t3435>Elinor regretted how this was deemed necessary; but she kept her thoughts to herself in the presence of a man and a soldier.</t3435>
<t3436>"The fates of the mother and daughter," said Colonel Brandon after a moment of silence, "are so similar!</t3436> <t3437>And I have neglected my responsibility to such an extent!</t3437><t3438>"</t3438>
<t3439>"Is he still in the city?"</t3439><t3440>"</t3440>
<t3441>"No; as soon as I got up, of course, I found her close to giving birth, so I sent her and her child to the village; they are staying there."</t3441>
<t3442>Thinking that he might be separating Elinor from her sister, he ended his visit shortly thereafter, receiving the same grateful thanks from Elinor and leaving her filled with feelings of affection and respect towards him.</t3442>
<t3443>When the details of this conversation were later repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, its effect on her was not quite as the former had hoped.</t3443> <t3444>It was not that Marianne did not believe any part of the accounts, for she listened to them with unbroken and docile attention, did not object, did not say anything, did not try to justify Willoughby, and as if with tears, felt it was impossible.</t3444> <t3445>Although this behavior convinced Elinor that Willoughby's guilt had deeply affected Marianne, and she was pleased to see that its effect was such that Marianne no longer avoided Colonel Brandon when he visited, and even spoke to him with a kind of affectionate respect, and although she saw that her mood was less touchy than before, she did not see that she was less sad.</t3445> <t3446>Her emotions settled, but they settled in a sorrowful depression.</t3446> <t3447>She felt the loss of Willoughby's character more heavily than the loss of her heart; his seduction and abandonment of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and whatever plans Willoughby might have had regarding herself, all gnawed at her mind to such an extent that she did not even want to express her feelings to Elinor; she quietly sank into her own melancholy thoughts, which grieved her sister more than if she had openly and frequently expressed her feelings.</t3447>
<t3448>Describing Mrs. Dashwood's feelings or language when she received and replied to Elinor's letter would only be to repeat what her daughters had already felt and said: a disappointment no less than Marianne's and an anger even greater than Elinor's.</t3448> <t3449>The long letters she wrote one after another conveyed everything she felt and thought, expressed her compassionate support for Marianne, and asked her to bear this misfortune with fortitude.</t3449> <t3450>If her mother could speak of fortitude, Marianne's trouble must have been truly ill-natured!</t3450> <t3451>If her mother could tell her not to worry, the reasons for these regrets must have been devastating and shameful!</t3451>
<t3452>At the expense of her own personal comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had decided that anywhere outside of Barton would be better for Marianne at that time; everything she saw in Barton would remind her of Willoughby in the most powerful and unsettling way, bringing back memories of the past.</t3452> <t3453>Therefore, she advised her daughters not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings under any circumstances; although the duration of the visit was not firmly decided, it was generally thought that it would be no less than five or six weeks.</t3453> <t3454>Various activities, items, and friends that were not present in Barton would be unavoidable there, and moreover, she hoped, they might occasionally distract and even entertain Marianne with other engagements besides herself, even if she scoffed at this idea now.</t3454>
<t3455>Her mother thought that in the city, Willoughby was as far away from the danger of seeing Marianne again as he was in the countryside, because there should be no one left around Willoughby who considered themselves Marianne's friend.</t3455> <t3456>No one's plan could bring them face to face; no one's negligence could expose them to a surprise; in the crowd of London, the chance of Willoughby encountering her was even lower than in the solitude of Barton, because Mrs. Dashwood would travel to Allenham regarding the marriage she initially saw as merely possible but now viewed as certain.</t3456>
<t3457>There was another reason why she wanted her children to stay where they were; a letter from her stepson said that he and his wife would be in town before mid-February, and Mrs. Dashwood thought it would be proper for them to see their brother from time to time.</t3457>
<t3458>Marianne had promised to act in accordance with her mother's views; although they were very different from what she desired and hoped for, based on erroneous assumptions and entirely wrong, and despite thinking that wanting her to stay longer in London deprived her of the only means to lessen her sorrow, namely her mother's affection, and condemned her to communities and environments that did not allow her a moment to breathe, she submitted to these views without objection.</t3458>
<t3459>But the thought that what brought her distress would bring happiness to her sister was a great consolation for her; on the other hand, Elinor, suspecting that it would be impossible to completely avoid Edward, comforted herself with the thought that staying longer, although it might be a danger to her own peace, would be better for Marianne than returning to Devonshire immediately.</t3459>
<t3460>The care she took to shield her sister from hearing Willoughby's name mentioned did not go unrewarded.</t3460> <t3461>Marianne unknowingly benefited from all its positive outcomes; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer mentioned him in her presence.</t3461> <t3462>Although Elinor wished the same forgetfulness to be adopted for herself, it was impossible; she had to listen to their wrath day by day.</t3462>
<t3463>According to Sir John, it was beyond belief.</t3463> <t3464>"A man he always admired so much!</t3464> <t3465>Such a well-mannered person!</t3465> <t3466>In his opinion, there was no better rider in England than him!</t3466> <t3467>It was an inexplicable event.</t3467> <t3468>With all his heart, he was now damned.</t3468> <t3469>He would never speak a word to him again, and if they met, he would never look at his face!</t3469> <t3470>No, even if they met next to the hunter's lodge in Barton and waited side by side for two hours, he would not look at his face.</t3470> <t3471>Such a treacherous man!</t3471> <t3472>Such a deceitful dog!</t3472> <t3473>Moreover, in their last meeting, he had offered him one of Folly's puppies!</t3473> <t3474>Now everything was over!</t3474><t3475>"</t3475>
<t3476>Mrs. Palmer was equally angry in her own way.</t3476> <t3477>"She was determined to end the acquaintance immediately, and was even very lucky never to have met him.</t3477> <t3478>With all her heart, she wished Combe Magna was not so close to Cleveland; but it didn't matter because it was already too far to visit; she hated him so much that she was determined never to mention his name again, and she would tell everyone she saw the same, calling him such a worthless man.</t3478><t3479>"</t3479>
<t3480>Mrs. Palmer's remaining affection manifested itself in gathering and relaying details about the forthcoming marriage to Elinor with all her might.</t3480> <t3481>Soon, she was able to tell which coachman was making the new carriage, which painter was working on Mr. Willoughby's portrait, and in which shop Miss Grey's dresses could be seen.</t3481>
<t3482>Lady Middleton's calm and polite indifference to the matter was a relief to Elinor, as she often felt overwhelmed by the noisy politeness of the others.</t3482> <t3483>It was a great comfort to be sure that at least one person in her circle of friends was not excited; knowing that there was someone she could face without them being curious about the details or worried about her sister's health was a great comfort.</t3483>
<t3484>Every quality is at times elevated beyond its true worth by momentary circumstances; sometimes, overwhelmed by officious condolences, Elinor too was forced to consider that propriety was more essential for peace than affability.</t3484>
<t3485>Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once a day, or if the topic came up frequently, twice a day by saying, "Truly shocking!" and through these gentle yet unchanging words, she not only managed to look at the Miss Dashwoods with a detached gaze at first, but also succeeded in looking at them without remembering a single word of the matter immediately after; thus, after supporting the pride of her own gender and condemning the faults of the other gender in a definitive manner, she felt free to engage with the affairs of her acquaintances, and even (despite Sir John's decision) decided to leave her card with Mrs. Willoughby as soon as she got married, since she would be a graceful and wealthy woman.</t3485>
<t3486>Colonel Brandon's polite, measured questions never disturbed Miss Dashwood.</t3486> <t3487>He had more than earned the privilege of being a confidant about her sister's sorrow with his friendly efforts to alleviate the grief; they always conversed in confidence.</t3487> <t3488>The main reward he received for the painful burden of explaining past troubles and present shames was Marianne's pitying glances as she occasionally watched him and (though not often) her affectionate voice when she had to speak to him or forced herself to do so.</t3488> <t3489>These convinced Colonel Brandon that his efforts had increased her goodwill towards him; they gave Elinor hope that this goodwill would grow even more after her; but unaware of all this, Mrs. Jennings, who thought the Colonel continued with his usual seriousness and could not be persuaded to propose or appoint himself to propose, started saying two days later that they would marry in November instead of mid-summer, and a week later that they would not marry at all.</t3489> <t3490>The harmony between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed to declare that all the honor of the mulberry tree, the canal, and the yew grove would be transferred to her; Mrs. Jennings had completely removed Mr. Ferrars from her agenda for some time.</t3490>
<t3491>In early February, fifteen days after receiving Willoughby's letter, Elinor informed her sister of his marriage, fulfilling a painful duty.</t3491> <t3492>She had made an effort to ensure that Marianne heard the news from her immediately after the ceremony, rather than discovering it in the newspapers she eagerly examined every morning.</t3492>
<t3493>Marianne received the news with a determined maturity; she said nothing about it and did not cry at first; but shortly after, tears flowed and she spent the whole day in a state no less agonizing than when she first heard she should expect the event.</t3493>
<t3494>As soon as the Willoughbys got married, they left the city; Elinor, now that there was no danger of encountering either of them, began to think that she could gradually persuade her sister, who had not left the house since the first blow had struck, to go out again as she used to.</t3494>
<t3495>At that time, the two Miss Steele cousins came to their home in the Bartlett Buildings in Holborn, reintroduced themselves to their more fashionable relatives in Conduit and Berkeley streets, and were received with great kindness by them.</t3495>
<t3496>Only Elinor was upset to see them.</t3496> <t3497>Their presence always caused her pain, and she struggled to respond maturely to Lucy's devastating joy at still finding her in the city.</t3497>
<t3498>"I would have been very upset if I hadn't found you here," he kept saying, placing a strong emphasis on that word.</t3498> <t3499>"But I always knew I would find you.</t3499> <t3500>I was almost certain you wouldn't leave London for a while, although you told me in Barton that you wouldn't stay for more than a month.</t3500> <t3501>But at that time, I thought you would probably change your mind when the time came.</t3501> <t3502>It would have been a terrible shame if you had left before your brother and sister-in-law arrived.</t3502> <t3503>I'm sure you're not in a hurry to leave now either.</t3503> <t3504>I'm extremely glad you didn't keep your word.</t3504><t3505>"</t3505>
<t3506>Elinor understood him very well and had to use all her willpower to appear as if she did not.</t3506>
<t3507>"Oh, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "how was your journey."</t3507><t3508>"</t3508>
<t3509>"It's not like a private car, of course," replied Miss Steele, with quick cheerfulness; "we came all the way by stagecoach, and a very sweet young man accompanied us.</t3509> <t3510>Dr. Davies was coming to the city, so we boarded the stagecoach with him; he was very kind and paid ten or twelve shillings more than us.</t3510><t3511>"</t3511>
<t3512>"Oh my!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "how delightful indeed!</t3512> <t3513>By the way, the doctor is single, just so you know.</t3513><t3514>"</t3514>
<t3515>"Here you go," said Miss Steele, pretending to be offended, "everyone laughs at me like this about the doctor, why, I don't understand.</t3515> <t3516>My cousins say I've stolen his heart, but I can honestly say I can't think about him for two minutes straight.</t3516> <t3517>'My God, your young man is coming, Nancy,' said my cousin the other day, having seen him coming towards the house from afar.</t3517> <t3518>'My young man, indeed!' I said - 'I have no idea who she meant.</t3518> <t3519>The doctor is nothing to me.</t3519><t3520>'"</t3520>
<t3521>"Come on, come on, it's always said like that at first - but it doesn't work - I think the doctor is fine, I mean.</t3521><t3522>"</t3522>
<t3523>"Seriously, no!" replied his cousin, pretending to be sincere, "and I beg you to object if you hear it being talked about.</t3523><t3524>"</t3524>
<t3525>Mrs. Jennings immediately assured her that she would not object, and Miss Steele was very happy.</t3525>
<t3526>"When they come to the city, you will surely go and stay with your brother and sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood," said Lucy, resuming her attack after a pause filled with hostile insinuations.</t3526>
<t3527>"No, I don't think we will stay.</t3527><t3528>"</t3528>
<t3529>"Oh yes, I think you will stay.</t3529><t3530>"</t3530>
<t3531>Elinor did not want to please him by objecting further.</t3531>
<t3532>"How nice of Mrs. Dashwood to allow both of you to stay for such a long time!"</t3532><t3533>"</t3533>
<t3534>"A long time, is it!" Mrs. Jennings interrupted.</t3534> <t3535>"Their outings have just begun!</t3535><t3536>"</t3536>
<t3537>Lucy was thus silenced.</t3537>
<t3538>"We were sorry not to see your sister, Miss Dashwood," said Miss Steele.</t3538> <t3539>"I was sorry she wasn't well."</t3539> <t3540>Marianne had left the room when they arrived.</t3540>
<t3541>"You are very kind.</t3541> <t3542>My sister will be equally disappointed to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been suffering from nervous headaches lately and cannot handle crowds or conversation.</t3542><t3543>"</t3543>
<t3544>"Ah my beautiful, what a pity!</t3544> <t3545>But Lucy and I are old friends! - I think she can see us; we won't say a word, I mean.</t3545><t3546>"</t3546>
<t3547>Elinor politely declined the offer.</t3547> <t3548>Her sister might be lying down or in her dressing gown, so she couldn't join them.</t3548>
<t3549>"Hey, if this is the issue," shouted Miss Steele, "let's go out and see it.</t3549><t3550>"</t3550>
<t3551>Elinor began to find such insensitivity unbearable; but Lucy's stern warning spared her the trouble of reprimanding her. Although Lucy's reaction, as was often the case, did not add grace to a sister's behavior, it was useful in correcting the behavior of the other sister.</t3551>
<t3552>Although she protested a little, Marianne yielded to her sister's insistence and agreed to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings for half an hour one morning.</t3552> <t3553>However, she set the condition that she would not go on any house visits and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's shop on Sackville Street, where Elinor was negotiating to exchange some of their mother's old-fashioned jewelry.</t3553>
<t3554>When they were standing at the door, Mrs. Jennings remembered that there was a lady she needed to visit at the other end of the street; since she had no business at Gray's, it was decided that she would make her visit while the young girls took care of their errands, and then she would join them afterwards.</t3554>
<t3555>When they climbed the stairs and entered, the Miss Dashwoods found the place so crowded that there was no one available to attend to their orders; they had to wait.</t3555> <t3556>The only thing to do was to sit at the end of the counter that seemed to be moving the fastest; there was only one gentleman standing there; Elinor hoped to awaken his courtesy for a quicker shopping experience.</t3556> <t3557>But the gentleman's sharp eye and refined taste outweighed his courtesy.</t3557> <t3558>He was ordering a toothpick box for himself and, after examining and discussing all the toothpick boxes in the shop for a quarter of an hour, and until the size, shape, and decorations of the box were finally determined by his own creative imagination, he cast several very sharp glances at the two ladies.</t3558>
<t3559>he had no time to show any interest other than wheat; although adorned with the latest fashion clothes, his gaze seemed to imprint a strong, natural, unadulterated triviality of character and face into Elinor's memory.</t3559>
<t3560>Marianne did not have to feel annoying emotions such as contempt and anger in the face of their brazen scrutiny of her appearance and the arrogance with which they pointed out the various flaws of the various toothpick boxes presented for her inspection, because her mind was not there; she was able to shut herself off into her thoughts and ignore what was happening around her in Mr. Gray's shop just as she did in her own bedroom.</t3560>
<t3561>Finally, the matter was decided.</t3561> <t3562>Ivory, gold, and pearl, all were chosen; the gentleman, who also indicated the last day he could continue without his toothpick box, put on his gloves with unhurried care, bestowed another look at the Miss Dashwoods that seemed more like a demand than admiration, and departed with an air of happy genuine affectation and false indifference.</t3562>
<t3563>Elinor wasted no time in discussing her work and was just finishing up when another gentleman appeared beside her.</t3563> <t3564>Elinor turned her eyes towards his face and, somewhat surprised, saw that it was her brother.</t3564>
<t3565>The excitement and joy they felt from the encounter were just enough to create an acceptable scene in Mr. Gray's shop.</t3565> <t3566>John Dashwood did not seem at all upset to see his sisters again; his sisters, on the other hand, were reasonably pleased with the encounter; his questions about their mother's health were respectful and considerate.</t3566>
<t3567>Elinor learned that she and Fanny had been in the city for two days.</t3567>
<t3568>"I really wanted to stop by yesterday," he said, "but it was impossible, because we had to take Harry to Exeter Exchange to see the wild animals: and the rest of the day Mrs</t3568>
<t3569>We spent it at Ferrars'.</t3569> <t3570>Harry was very pleased.</t3570> <t3571>This morning, as soon as I had a free hour, I was definitely going to call you, but when one first arrives in the city, there are so many things to do.</t3571> <t3572>I came here to get a seal made for Fanny.</t3572> <t3573>But tomorrow, I will surely be able to stop by Berkeley Street and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.</t3573> <t3574>As far as I understand, she is quite a wealthy woman.</t3574> <t3575>There are also the Middletons, you must introduce me to them as well.</t3575> <t3576>As the relatives of my stepmother, it will make me happy to pay my respects to them.</t3576> <t3577>From what I understand, they are excellent neighbors to you in the village.</t3577><t3578>"</t3578>
<t3579>"Truly delicious.</t3579> <t3580>Their attention to our comfort, their friendship in every detail, is more than I can express.</t3580><t3581>"</t3581>
<t3582>"I am very glad to hear that, believe me; I am truly very glad.</t3582> <t3583>But it should be so; because very wealthy people, you can naturally expect every kindness and comfort from them that can make your situation more pleasant.</t3583> <t3584>So, you have settled comfortably into your little cottage and you lack nothing!</t3584> <t3585>Edward gave us a very nice description of that place; he said it was the most complete example of its kind ever; and it seems you love it very much.</t3585> <t3586>Hearing this made us very happy, rest assured.</t3586><t3587>"</t3587>
<t3588>Elinor felt a little embarrassed by her brother; she was not at all sorry to be relieved from the necessity of replying to him when Mrs. Jennings's servant came to say that his mistress was waiting for them at the door.</t3588>
<t3589>Mr. Dashwood accompanied them downstairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of his carriage, and, repeating his hope of calling on them the next day, took his leave.</t3589>
<t3590>The visit happened as mentioned.</t3590> <t3591>Since their aunts couldn't come, they sent their apologies; "but she was so busy with her mother that she really had no time to go anywhere."</t3591> <t3592>However, Mrs. Jennings immediately told her that she was not at all fond of such ceremonies, that they were all cousins or something of that sort, the first cunning dog!</t3592> <t3593>Moreover, during their last meeting, she had offered her one of Folly's puppies!</t3593> <t3594>Now everything was over!</t3594><t3595>"</t3595>
<t3596>Mrs. Palmer was equally angry in her own way.</t3596> <t3597>"She was determined to end the acquaintance immediately, and was even very lucky never to have met him.</t3597> <t3598>With all her heart, she wished that Combe Magna was not so close to Cleveland; but it didn't matter because it was already too far to visit; she hated him so much that she was determined never to mention his name again, and she would tell everyone she saw the same, calling him such a worthless man.</t3598><t3599>"</t3599>
<t3600>Mrs. Palmer's remaining compassion manifested itself in gathering details about the approaching wedding with all her might and relaying them to Elinor.</t3600> <t3601>Soon, she was able to tell which coachman was making the new carriage, which painter was working on Mr. Willoughby's portrait, and in which shop Miss Grey's dresses could be seen.</t3601>
<t3602>Lady Middleton's calm and polite indifference to the matter was a relief to Elinor, as she often felt overwhelmed by the noisy politeness of the others.</t3602> <t3603>It was a great comfort to be sure that at least one person in her circle of friends was not excited; knowing that there was someone she could face without them being curious about the details or worried about her sister's health was a great comfort.</t3603>
<t3604>Every quality is occasionally elevated beyond its true value by momentary circumstances; sometimes, overwhelmed by officious condolences, Elinor too was forced to think that courtesy was more essential for peace than cordiality.</t3604>
<t3605>Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once a day, or if the topic came up frequently, twice a day by saying, "Truly shocking!" and through these gentle but unchanging words, she not only managed to look at the Miss Dashwoods with an indifferent eye at first, but immediately after, succeeded in looking without remembering a single word of the matter; thus, having supported the pride of her own gender and condemned the faults of the other gender in a definitive manner, she felt free to engage with her acquaintances' matters, and even (despite Sir John's decision) decided to leave her card with Mrs. Willoughby as soon as she got married, since she would be a graceful and wealthy woman.</t3605>
<t3606>Colonel Brandon's polite and measured questions never bothered Miss Dashvrood.</t3606> <t3607>He had more than earned the privilege of being a confidant about her sister's sorrow with his friendly efforts to alleviate it; they always conversed in confidence.</t3607> <t3608>The primary reward for the painful burden of explaining past troubles and present shames had been Marianne's pitying glances while watching him from time to time and (though not often) her affectionate voice when she had to speak to him or forced herself to do so.</t3608> <t3609>These convinced Colonel Brandon that his efforts had increased her goodwill towards him; they gave Elinor the hope that this goodwill would increase even more after her; but unaware of all this, Mrs. Jennings, who thought that the Colonel continued with his usual seriousness and could not be persuaded to propose or to appoint himself to propose, started to say two days later that they would marry towards November instead of mid-summer, and a week later that they would not marry at all.</t3609> <t3610>The harmony between the Colonel and Miss Dashvrood seemed to declare that all the honor of the mulberry tree, the canal, and the yew grove would be transferred to her; Mrs. Jennings had entirely removed Mr. Ferrars from the agenda for some time.</t3610>

<t3626>Elinor understood him very well and had to use all her willpower to appear as if she did not.</t3626>
<t3627>"Oh, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "how was your journey."</t3627><t3628>"</t3628>
<t3629>"It's not like having a private car, of course," replied Miss Steele, with quick cheerfulness; "we came all the way by stagecoach, and a very sweet young man accompanied us.</t3629> <t3630>Dr. Davies was coming to town, so we got on the stagecoach with him; he was very polite and paid ten or twelve shillings more than us.</t3630><t3631>"</t3631>
<t3632>"Oh my, oh my!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "how delightful indeed!</t3632> <t3633>By the way, the doctor is also single, just so you know.</t3633><t3634>"</t3634>
<t3635>"Here you go," said Miss Steele, pretending to be offended, "everyone laughs at me about the doctor, why, I don't understand.</t3635> <t3636>My cousins say I've stolen his heart, but for my part, I can say I can't think about him for two minutes straight.</t3636> <t3637>'My God, your young man is coming, Nancy,' said my cousin the other day, having seen him coming towards the house from afar.</t3637> <t3638>'My young man, indeed!'

<t3641>"Come on, come on, it's always said like that at first -but it doesn't work -I think the doctor is fine, I mean.</t3641><t3642>"</t3642>
<t3643>"Really not!" replied his cousin, pretending to be sincere, "and I beg you to object as well if you hear it being talked about.</t3643><t3644>"</t3644>
<t3645>Mrs. Jennings assured her immediately that she would not object, and Miss Steele was very happy.</t3645>
<t3646>"When they come to the city, you will probably go and stay with your brother and sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood," said Lucy, resuming her attack after a pause filled with hostile insinuations.</t3646>
<t3647>"No, I don't think we will stay.</t3647><t3648>"</t3648>
<t3649>"Ah yes, I think you will stay.</t3649><t3650>"</t3650>
<t3651>Elinor did not want to please him by objecting further.</t3651>
<t3652>"How nice of Mrs. Dashwood to allow both of you to stay for such a long time!"</t3652><t3653>"</t3653>
<t3654>"A long time, is it!" Mrs. Jennings interrupted.</t3654> <t3655>"Their outings have just begun!</t3655><t3656>"</t3656>
<t3657>Thus, Lucy was silenced.</t3657>
<t3658>"We were sorry not to see your sister, Miss Dashwood," said Miss Steele.</t3658> <t3659>"I am sorry she is not well."</t3659> <t3660>Marianne had left the room when they arrived.</t3660>
<t3661>"You are very kind.</t3661> <t3662>My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been suffering from nervous headaches lately and cannot handle crowds or conversation.</t3662><t3663>"</t3663>
<t3664>"Ah my beauty, what a pity!</t3664> <t3665>But Lucy and I are old friends! -I think she can see us; we won't say a word, I mean.</t3665><t3666>"</t3666>
<t3667>Elinor politely declined the offer.</t3667> <t3668>Her sister might be lying down or in her dressing gown, so she could not join them.</t3668>
<t3669>"Yo, if that's the issue," shouted Miss Steele, "let's go out and see him.</t3669><t3670>"</t3670>
<t3671>Elinor began to find such rudeness unbearable; but Lucy's stern warning saved her from the trouble of reprimanding her. Although Lucy's reaction, as often, did not add grace to one sister's behavior, it was useful in correcting the other sister's conduct.</t3671>
<t3672>Although she protested a little, Marianne yielded to her sister's insistence and agreed to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings for half an hour one morning.</t3672> <t3673>However, she set the condition that she would not visit any houses and would only accompany them to Gray's shop on Sackville Street, where Elinor was making arrangements to alter some of her mother's old-fashioned jewelry.</t3673>
<t3674>When they were standing at the door, Mrs. Jennings remembered that there was a lady she needed to visit at the other end of the street; since she had no business in Gray, it was decided that she would make her visit while the young girls took care of their errands and then join them afterwards.</t3674>
<t3675>When they climbed the stairs and entered, the Miss Dashwoods found the place so crowded that there was no one available to attend to their orders; they had to wait.</t3675> <t3676>The only thing to do was to sit at the end of the counter that seemed to be moving the fastest; there was only one gentleman standing there; Elinor hoped to awaken his courtesy for a quicker shopping experience.</t3676> <t3677>But the gentleman's sharp eye and refined taste outweighed his courtesy.</t3677> <t3678>He was ordering a toothpick box for himself and, after examining and discussing all the toothpick boxes in the shop for a quarter of an hour, he cast several very sharp glances at the two ladies until the size, shape, and decorations of the box were finally determined by his own creative imagination.</t3678>
<t3679>he had no time to show any interest other than hunting; although he was adorned with the latest fashion clothes, his gaze seemed to imprint a strong, natural, unadulterated insignificance of character and face into Elinor's memory.</t3679>
<t3680>Marianne did not have to feel annoying emotions such as contempt and anger in the face of their brazen scrutiny of appearances and the arrogance with which they identified various flaws in the various toothpick boxes presented for inspection, because her mind was not there; she was able to shut herself off into her thoughts and not notice what was happening around her, just as she did in her own bedroom and in Mr. Gray's shop.</t3680>
<t3681>In the end, the matter was decided.</t3681> <t3682>Ivory, gold, and pearl, all were chosen; the gentleman, who also indicated the last day he could continue his life without his toothpick box, put on his gloves with unhurried care, bestowed one more look at the Miss Dashwoods that seemed more demanding than admiring, and departed with an air of happy genuine affectation and fake indifference.</t3682>
<t3683>Elinor wasted no time talking about her work and was just finishing her explanation when another gentleman appeared beside her.</t3683> <t3684>Elinor turned her eyes towards his face and, somewhat surprised, saw that it was her brother.</t3684>
<t3685>The excitement and joy they felt from the encounter was just enough to create an acceptable scene in Mr. Gray's shop.</t3685> <t3686>John Dashwood did not seem at all upset to see his sisters again; his sisters, on the other hand, were somewhat pleased with the encounter; he asked respectfully and attentively about their mother's health.</t3686>
<t3687>Elinor learned that she and Fanny had been in the city for two days.</t3687>
<t3688>"I really wanted to visit you yesterday," he said, "but it was impossible, because we had to take Harry to Exeter Exchange to see the wild animals: and the rest of the day Mrs</t3688>
<t3689>We spent time at Ferrars'.</t3689> <t3690>Harry was very happy.</t3690> <t3691>This morning, as soon as I had a free hour, I was definitely going to call you, but when you first come to the city, there is so much to do.</t3691> <t3692>I also came here to get a seal made for Fanny.</t3692> <t3693>But tomorrow, I will surely be able to stop by Berkeley Street and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings.</t3693> <t3694>As far as I understand, she is quite a wealthy woman.</t3694> <t3695>There are also the Middletons, you must introduce me to them as well.</t3695> <t3696>As the relatives of my stepmother, I will be happy to pay my respects to them.</t3696> <t3697>From what I understand, they are excellent neighbors to you in the village.</t3697><t3698>"</t3698>
<t3699>"Truly delicious.</t3699> <t3700>The attention they showed to make us comfortable, their friendship in every detail, is more than I can express.</t3700><t3701>"</t3701>
<t3702>"I am very glad to hear this, believe me; I am truly very glad.</t3702> <t3703>But it should be so; because you have very wealthy relatives and every courtesy and comfort that can improve your situation can naturally be expected from them.</t3703> <t3704>So you have settled comfortably in your little cottage and have no deficiencies!</t3704> <t3705>Edward gave us a very nice description of that place; he said it was the most complete example of its kind ever; and it seems you love it there very much.</t3705> <t3706>Hearing this made us very happy, rest assured.</t3706><t3707>"</t3707>
<t3708>Elinor felt a little embarrassed by her brother; she was not at all sorry to be spared the necessity of replying to him when Mrs. Jennings' servant came to say that his mistress was waiting for them at the door.</t3708>
<t3709>Mr. Dashwood accompanied them downstairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of his carriage, and, after repeating his hope of calling on them the next day, took his leave.</t3709>
<t3710>The visit took place as mentioned.</t3710> <t3711>Since their aunts couldn't come, they sent their apologies; "but she was so busy with her mother that she really had no time to go anywhere."</t3711> <t3712>However, Mrs. Jennings immediately told her that she was not at all fond of formalities, that they were all cousins or something like that, and that she would visit Mrs. John Dashwood at the first opportunity and take her along to see her sisters.</t3712> <t3713>Although their brother's behavior towards them was measured, it was very polite; he was exceptionally kind to Mrs. Jennings; he watched Colonel Brandon, who followed him, with curiosity, only wanting to know that he was equally wealthy to show the same courtesy.</t3713>
<t3714>After spending half an hour with them, he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.</t3714> <t3715>Since the weather was very nice, Elinor immediately agreed.</t3715> <t3716>The questions began as soon as they left the house.</t3716>
<t3717>"Who is Colonel Brandon?</t3717> <t3718>Is he a wealthy man?</t3718><t3719>"</t3719>
<t3720>"Yes, he has a very good property in Dorsetshire.</t3720><t3721>"</t3721>
<t3722>"I'm glad to hear that.</t3722> <t3723>He seems to be quite a gentleman; I believe, Elinor, I can congratulate you on the prospect of making a very respectable marriage in your life.</t3723><t3724>"</t3724>
<t3725>"Me, brother!</t3725> <t3726>What do you mean?</t3726><t3727>"</t3727>
<t3728>"He likes you.</t3728> <t3729>I watched him carefully and I am sure of it.</t3729> <t3730>How much is his fortune?</t3730><t3731>"</t3731>
<t3732>"Probably around two thousand a year."</t3732><t3733>"</t3733>
<t3734>"Two thousand a year;" then, forcing himself into a mood of eager generosity, he added, "Elinor, for your sake, I would wish with all my heart that the income were twice as much."</t3734><t3735>"</t3735>
<t3736>"Of course, I believe you," replied Elinor, "but I am sure that Colonel Brandon has no desire to marry me.</t3736><t3737>"</t3737>
<t3738>"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very mistaken.</t3738> <t3739>If you make a little effort, you will secure him.</t3739> <t3740>He might already be undecided; the smallness of your fortune might be hindering him; his friends might be advising him otherwise.</t3740> <t3741>But those little attentions that ladies can easily show will encourage him, even if he doesn't want to be.</t3741> <t3742>There is no reason for you not to try to win him.</t3742> <t3743>After all, it is impossible for you to have any prior attachment to anyone - I mean, you know, any such attachment is impossible, the obstacles are countless - you are wise enough to see all this.</t3743> <t3744>That person must be Colonel Brandon; I will also show all the necessary attention to ensure he is pleased with you and your family.</t3744> <t3745>This would be a marriage that would please everyone.</t3745> <t3746>In short, thus" - she lowered her voice to an important whisper - "all parties will be exceedingly pleased with this."</t3746> <t3747>Then, composing herself, she added, "I mean to say - your friends are really eager to see you married; especially Fanny; because you wouldn't believe how much she cares for your well-being.</t3747> <t3748>Her mother, Mrs. Ferrars, is the same, she is a very kind-hearted woman, I am sure you will love her; she said so the other day too.</t3748><t3749>"</t3749>
<t3750>Elinor did not deign to reply.</t3750>
<t3751>"For Fanny's brother and my sister to be getting married at the same time;" he continued, "it would be a very nice thing, even a funny thing.</t3751> <t3752>But it's not impossible at all.</t3752><t3753>"</t3753>
<t3754>"Mr. Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, resolutely, "is he going to marry?</t3754><t3755>"</t3755>
<t3756>"It's not completely settled, but there's a rush about it.</t3756> <t3757>The young man has a wonderful mother.</t3757> <t3758>Mrs. Ferrars will come forward with tremendous generosity and grant him a thousand pounds a year, of course, if the marriage takes place.</t3758> <t3759>The lady Miss Morton, the only daughter of Lord Morton, has thirty thousand a year. A highly desirable connection for both sides; I have no doubt it will happen in due time.</t3759> <t3760>A thousand pounds a year is a lot for a mother to part with, and forever every year; but Mrs. Ferrars is a noble person.</t3760> <t3761>Here's another example of her generosity: -The other day, as soon as we arrived in the city, thinking we might not have much money on us, she slipped a two hundred pound banknote into Fanny's hand.</t3761> <t3762>It was really appreciated, because we have great expenses while we're here.</t3762><t3763>"</t3763>
<t3764>He paused to receive Elinor's approval and expression of pity; Elinor forced herself to say,</t3764>
<t3765>"Both your expenses in the city and in the village must certainly be quite high, but your income is substantial.</t3765><t3766>"</t3766>
<t3767>"It's not as big as everyone thinks, I'm afraid.</t3767> <t3768>However, I'm not complaining; it's undoubtedly a comfortable income, and I hope it will get even better over time.</t3768> <t3769>Expanding the land still costs serious money.</t3769> <t3770>Moreover, I made a small purchase for these six months; you remember East Kingham Farm, where old Gibson used to live.</t3770> <t3771>The land appealed to me in every way, and it was so close to my property that I considered it my duty to buy it.</t3771> <t3772>If it went to someone else, I couldn't find an answer to give my conscience.</t3772> <t3773>One must be willing to spend money for comfort; this deal cost me a lot of money.</t3773><t3774>"</t3774>
<t3775>"More than you actually and essentially think it will be worth.</t3775><t3776>"</t3776>
<t3777>"I hope not.</t3777> <t3778>The very next day, I could have sold it for more than I paid; but considering the money I spent when buying, I could have really faced misfortune, because the shares of that company were so low that if the necessary money wasn't readily available from my banker, I would have incurred a great loss from the sale.</t3778><t3779>"</t3779>
<t3780>All Elinor could do was smile.</t3780>
<t3781>"When we first came to Norland, we had other large and unavoidable expenses.</t3781> <t3782>Our dear father, as you know, left all the Stanhill estates (they were quite valuable) to your mother at Norland.</t3782> <t3783>I am not at all resentful of his doing so; he certainly had the right to dispose of his property as he saw fit.</t3783> <t3784>But as a result, we had to purchase a large amount of bedding, porcelain, and such to replace what was taken.</t3784> <t3785>After all these expenses, you can imagine how far we were from being wealthy, and how much we appreciated Mrs. Ferrars' kindness.</t3785><t3786>"</t3786>
<t3787>"Of course," said Elinor; "with his generosity supporting you, I hope you can live in more comfortable conditions."</t3787><t3788>"</t3788>
<t3789>"I think she has another year or two," he said seriously; "besides, there is still much to be done.</t3789> <t3790>Not a single stone has been placed in Fanny's greenhouse yet, and only the location of the flower garden has been marked.</t3790><t3791>"</t3791>
<t3792>"Where will the greenhouse be?</t3792><t3793>"</t3793>
<t3794>"On the hill behind the house.</t3794> <t3795>The old walnut trees were cut down to make space.</t3795> <t3796>It will be very nicely visible from many parts of the grove, the flower garden will also descend the slope in front of it and will be extremely pleasant.</t3796> <t3797>We cleared all the old brush that had grown here and there on the hill.</t3797><t3798>"</t3798>
<t3799>Elinor kept her sorrow and anger to herself and was thankful that Marianne was not there to share the rage.</t3799>
<t3800>Now that he had spoken enough to clarify his poverty and had dismissed the obligation to buy a pair of earrings for his sisters on his next trip to Gray, his thoughts became more cheerful, and he began to congratulate Elinor for having a friend like Mrs. Jennings.</t3800>
<t3801>"She really seems to be a very valuable woman.</t3801> <t3802>-Her house, her lifestyle, all point to a very good income; moreover, not only has she been very helpful to you so far, but in the end, it will be an acquaintance that will be extraordinarily in your favor; it is so clear that she values you greatly that you will probably not be forgotten when she dies.</t3802> <t3803>-She must have a lot to leave behind.</t3803><t3804>"</t3804>
<t3805>"He has nothing, I think; just his furniture, leave that to his children"</t3805>
<t3806>"But it is inconceivable that he would spend all of his earnings.</t3806> <t3807>Very few people with common sense would do that; whatever is being saved will be disposed of.</t3807><t3808>"</t3808>
<t3809>"Do you think it's more likely that he would leave it to us instead of his own daughters?</t3809><t3810>"</t3810>
<t3811>"Both of his daughters have made very good marriages, so I don't see any reason for him to think about them any further.</t3811> <t3812>However, in my opinion, the fact that he gives you so much importance, treats you this way, and involves you in his future plans, grants you a kind of claim that no woman with a conscience would ignore.</t3812> <t3813>He couldn't show a more delicate behavior and he can't be doing all of this without being aware of the expectations he is creating.</t3813><t3814>"</t3814>
<t3815>"But it creates no expectations in the concerned parties.</t3815> <t3816>Really, brother, you are taking your concern for our well-being and prosperity too far.</t3816><t3817>"</t3817>
<t3818>"Not at all," he said, appearing to pull himself together, "people can do very little, very little indeed.</t3818> <t3819>But dear Elinor, what is wrong with Marianne? -she looks very unhealthy, her color is gone, she has become thin.</t3819> <t3820>Is she ill?</t3820><t3821>"</t3821>
<t3822>"Not good, he's been having a nervous breakdown for a few weeks."</t3822><t3823>"</t3823>
<t3824>"I am saddened by this.</t3824> <t3825>At her age, even the slightest illness can forever tarnish her beauty!</t3825> <t3826>Her beauty was very short-lived!</t3826> <t3827>When I saw her last September, she was a very beautiful girl, capable of enchanting men.</t3827> <t3828>There is something in her beauty that particularly pleases men in terms of style.</t3828> <t3829>I remember, Fanny used to say she would marry before you; not because she was less fond of you, but it just came to her mind.</t3829> <t3830>However, she must have been mistaken.</t3830> <t3831>I now doubt whether Marianne can marry someone earning more than five or six hundred a year, at most; I would be very surprised if you couldn't do better.</t3831> <t3832>Dorsetshire! I know very little about Dorsetshire, but dear Elinor, I would be very pleased to get to know it better; I believe I can reciprocate by becoming one of your first and most beloved guests along with Fanny.</t3832><t3833>"</t3833>
<t3834>Elinor seriously tried to convince her that there was no possibility of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation too gratifying for her to be dissuaded from, and she seemed genuinely determined to foster an intimacy with that gentleman and to support the marriage with every possible interest.</t3834> <t3835>She felt such remorse for having done nothing for her sisters that she was desperate for everyone else to do everything for them; a marriage proposal from Colonel Brandon or an inheritance from Mrs. Jennings was the easiest way to make up for her own neglect.</t3835>
<t3836>Their luck was in, they found Lady Middleton at home; before their visit ended, Sir John also arrived.</t3836> <t3837>Both sides showed plenty of courtesy.</t3837> <t3838>Sir John was ready to like everyone, and although Mr. Dashwood didn’t know much about horses, he soon decided he was a good man; on the other hand, Lady Middleton found his appearance fashionable enough and thought he was worthy of being a friend; Mr. Dashwood left pleased with both of them.</t3838>
<t3839>"I have very sweet news to give Fanny," she said while walking back with her sister.</t3839> <t3840>"Lady Middleton is indeed a very elegant woman!</t3840> <t3841>I am sure Fanny would very much like to know such a woman, and Mrs. Jennings is also extremely refined, though not as elegant as her daughter.</t3841> <t3842>There is no need for your aunt to avoid visiting her; honestly, the situation was a bit like that, naturally; because we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the wife of a man who made all his money through low means; and both Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were of the opinion that neither she nor her daughters were the kind of women Fanny would want to be friends with.</t3842> <t3843>But now I can describe both of them to her in a very satisfactory manner.</t3843><t3844>"</t3844>
<t3845>Mrs. John Dashwood trusted her husband's opinions so much that the next day she visited both Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; her trust was rewarded when Mrs. Jennings saw that the woman her sisters-in-law were staying with was not at all unworthy of her attention; as for Lady Middleton, she thought she was one of the most charming women in the world.</t3845>
<t3846>Lady Middleton liked Mrs. Dashwood in the same way.</t3846> <t3847>On both sides, there was a kind of cold-hearted selfishness that drew them to each other; they loved each other within a decorum of soulless behavior and general mindlessness.</t3847>
<t3848>However, the same behavior that made Mrs. John Dashwood appealing to Lady Middleton did not suit Mrs. Jennings' taste; according to her, Mrs. John Dashwood was a woman with a cold demeanor, who seemed somewhat arrogant, and who greeted her husband's sisters insensitively and without having anything to say. She sat in silence for at least seven and a half minutes of the quarter-hour allotted to her on Berkeley Street.</t3848>
<t3849>Elinor wanted to find out if Edward was in town, but she was reluctant to ask; nothing could make Fanny mention Edward's name in front of her until she could tell her that his marriage to Miss Morton was finalized or until her husband's expectations regarding Colonel Brandon were fulfilled. Because still</t3849>
<t3850>He believed that they were so tightly bound to each other that no matter how meticulously they were kept separate in words and actions, it would never be enough.</t3850> <t3851>Nevertheless, information that he could not provide came shortly from another source.</t3851> <t3852>Although Lucy soon came to town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood, she sought Elinor's sympathy because she still hadn't seen Edward.</t3852> <t3853>Edward had not dared to come to Bartlett Building for fear of being seen, and although their mutual impatience to meet was beyond description, they still could do nothing but correspond.</t3853>
<t3854>Edward himself informed them that he was in the city by visiting Berkeley Street twice in a very short time.</t3854> <t3855>When they returned from their morning outings, they found his card on the table twice.</t3855> <t3856>Elinor was glad that he had visited, but she was even more glad that she had missed him.</t3856>
<t3857>The Dashwoods enjoyed the Middletons so immensely that, despite not being in the habit of giving much, they decided to host them for dinner; shortly after their acquaintance began, they invited them to Harley Street, where they had bought a very good house three months earlier.</t3857> <t3858>Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were also invited; John Dashwood did not neglect to invite Colonel Brandon; the Colonel, who always enjoyed being in the company of the Miss Dashwoods, received his persistent invitation with some surprise but great pleasure.</t3858> <t3859>They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; however, Elinor could not find out whether her sons would be at the event.</t3859> <t3860>Nevertheless, the hope of seeing him was enough to spark Elinor's interest in the invitation; for although she could now meet Edward's mother without the great fear of what she would think of her that once accompanied such an introduction, her desire to be in Mrs. Ferrars' presence and her curiosity to see what she looked like were as vivid as ever.</t3860>
<t3861>His interest while waiting for the meeting soon increased not more joyfully, but more strongly, when he heard that Miss Steele and her party would also be there.</t3861>
<t3862>They had so endeared themselves to Lady Middleton, and had so impressed her with their services, that despite Lucy being hardly considered elegant and her sister not even being polite, Lady Middleton was as eager as Sir John to invite them to stay for a couple of weeks on Conduit Street; and when the Dashwoods learned of the invitation, the Steele sisters' affairs coincidentally aligned so perfectly that they began their visit just a few days before the gathering.</t3862>
<t3863>Although the belief that they would receive attention from Mrs. John Dashwood as the nieces of the gentleman who had taken care of his brother for years would not be very useful in securing them a place at her table, they were invited as guests of Lady Middleton; Lucy, who had long wanted the opportunity to personally introduce herself to the family, to see the family members and the challenges ahead of her up close, and to make an effort to please them, had never been happier in her life than when she received Mrs. John Dashwood's invitation.</t3863>
<t3864>The effect of the invitation on Elinor was very different.</t3864> <t3865>Elinor immediately thought that she would be invited to a party given by Edward's sister, who lived with her mother, and that she would see him for the first time after everything that had happened, and with Lucy by his side! - how could she bear it, she did not know!</t3865>
<t3866>These concerns were perhaps not entirely rational, and obviously not based on facts.</t3866> <t3867>Nevertheless, she was freed from them not through her own recollection, but thanks to Lucy's goodwill; when Lucy told her that Edward would not be on Harley Street on Tuesday, she thought she had dealt a severe blow to Elinor, and even believed she had exacerbated the wound by explaining that Edward would not come because he feared he could not hide his immense love for her if they were together.</t3867>
<t3868>The important Tuesday arrived when the two young ladies would be introduced to this intimidating mother-in-law.</t3868>
<t3869>"Have pity on me, dear Miss Dashwood!" said Lucy, as they walked together towards the stairs - for the Middletons had followed Mrs. Jennings so quickly that they were all following the servant at the same time. "I have no one here but you."</t3869> <t3870>"Believe me, I can barely stand."</t3870> <t3871>Oh my God! - Soon I will see the person who holds all my happiness in their hands - the person who will be my mother!" —</t3871>
<t3872>Elinor could have immediately reassured her by suggesting that the person they were about to see was more likely to be Miss Morton's mother rather than her own, but instead, with great sincerity, she promised to sympathize with her—Lucy, who hoped to be an object of uncontrollable jealousy for Elinor, was surprised, even though she herself was genuinely distressed.</t3872>
<t3873>Mrs. Ferrars was a petite, slender woman with an upright posture that bordered on formality, and a serious, even sour expression.</t3873> <t3874>Her complexion was a pale yellow; her nose and mouth were small, lacking beauty and naturally devoid of expression; but the fortunate tautness of her forehead gave her face an appearance of strong pride and irritability, saving it from the shame of insignificance.</t3874> <t3875>She was not a talkative woman: unlike most people, she proportioned her words to the number of her ideas; not a single syllable dropped from her lips for Miss Dashwood, whom she was resolutely determined to despise under any circumstances.</t3875>
<t3876>Elinor could no longer be unhappy with his behavior.</t3876> <t3877>A few months ago, this would have upset her greatly; but now Mrs. Ferrars could not upset her with it; -especially the difference in her behavior towards the Miss Steeles, which seemed to be done deliberately to humiliate her more, only amused Elinor.</t3877> <t3878>She couldn't help but smile at the generosity shown to the same person by both the mother and the daughter -because Lucy was kept separate from everyone else- because if they knew as much as Elinor did, they would devour her; this while Elinor sat relatively powerless to hurt them, being openly ignored by both.</t3878> <t3879>But while smiling at such misguided generosity, she couldn't think about the simple-minded foolishness from which this generosity stemmed, nor could she observe the calculated attentions the Miss Steeles showed to ensure the continuation of this generosity.</t3879>
<t3880>Lucy was intoxicated by being singled out in such an honorable manner; all Miss Steele needed to be extremely happy was to be harassed about Dr. Davies.</t3880>
<t3881>A lavish table was set, there were numerous servants, and everything showcased the Lady’s penchant for ostentation and the Gentleman’s ability to finance it.</t3881> <t3882>Despite the expansions and additions being made to the Norland estate, and despite its owner once being on the verge of selling it due to being strapped for a few thousand pounds, there was no sign of the poverty he was trying to attribute to it; -no sign of poverty except for the lack of sensible conversation -but in this regard, the deficiency was extreme.</t3882> <t3883>John Dashwood had very little to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife had nothing at all.</t3883> <t3884>But this was nothing to be ashamed of, for most of their guests were in the same situation; nearly all of them were struggling under one inadequacy or another to be charming -Foolishness, either innate or acquired -lack of grace -soullessness -or lack of character.</t3884>
<t3885>When the ladies retired to the sitting room after dinner, this poverty became particularly evident, because the men had kept the conversation somewhat varied - politics, turning the land, training the horses - but then it all ended; until the coffee arrived, the ladies were occupied with a single topic, which was the difference in height between Harry Dashwood, who was about the same age, and Lady Middleton's second son, William.</t3885>
<t3886>If both children had been there, the issue could have been easily resolved by measuring the heights of both; but since only Harry was there, both sides could only speculate; moreover, everyone had the right to be equally persistent in their own opinion and to repeat their view as much as they wished.</t3886>
<t3887>The sides were formed as follows:</t3887>
<t3888>Although each mother truly believed that her own son was taller, they politely expressed opinions in favor of the other.</t3888>
<t3889>Two grandmothers, if not with less partisanship, but in a more sincere manner, persistently supported their own grandchildren</t3889>
<t3890>Lucy, who was writhing to please one mother more than the other, thought that the children were quite tall for their ages and could not see any difference between them; Miss Steele also spoke in favor of both with all her speed.</t3890>
<t3891>Elinor, who once expressed her opinion in favor of William and further offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny, saw no need to insist on her view; whereas Marianne, when asked for her opinion, offended them all at once by saying she hadn't thought about it and had no opinion.</t3891>
<t3892>Before leaving Norland, Elinor had painted a very beautiful pair of fireplace screens for her aunt; these had now been brought to the house and put in place, adorning the current room: when he entered the room after the other gentlemen, these screens caught John Dashwood's eye, and he, being officious, took them and handed them to Colonel Brandon to look at.</t3892>
<t3893>"These were made by my elder sister," he said; "I assume you, as a man of taste, would appreciate them.</t3893> <t3894>I don't know if you've seen her paintings before, but it is generally accepted that she makes extraordinarily beautiful paintings.</t3894><t3895>"</t3895>
<t3896>After the Colonel rejected all the implications of expertise, he sincerely admired the visors just as he would admire any picture made by Miss Dashwood; naturally, the curiosity of others was also aroused, and the visors were passed around for everyone to examine.</t3896> <t3897>Mrs. Ferrars, not realizing they were Elinor's work, particularly wanted to look at them; after receiving the gratifying proof of Lady Middleton's approval, Fanny presented them to her mother, not neglecting to mention that they were made by Miss Dashwood.</t3897>
<t3898>"Hm," said Mrs. Ferrars, "very nice," and without looking at them even once, she handed them back to her daughter.</t3898>
<t3899>Maybe Fanny thought for a moment that her mother was being too rude, -because she blushed a little and immediately said,</t3899>
<t3900>"They are very beautiful, mom -aren't they?" But immediately after, probably fearing that this time too she was being too polite, too encouraging, she added,</t3900>
<t3901>"Don't you sense a bit of Miss Morton's style in these, mother?</t3901> <t3902>-She paints wonderfully!</t3902> <t3903>-Her last landscape was done so beautifully!</t3903><t3904>"</t3904>
<t3905>"It was really beautiful!"</t3905> <t3906>"But she does everything beautifully."</t3906> <t3907>Marianne couldn't stand it any longer.</t3907> <t3908>-She had never liked Mrs. Ferrars; hearing someone else being praised so excessively in front of Elinor, even though she had no idea what was meant, immediately provoked her; she said heatedly,</t3908>
<t3909>"This is a very strange kind of admiration! -What do we care about Miss Morton? -who knows her, who cares? -we are talking about Elinor here.</t3909><t3910>"</t3910>
<t3911>He said this and took the visors from his aunt's hand to look at them in the way he believed they deserved to be looked at.</t3911>
<t3912>Mrs. Ferrars seemed extremely angry; she straightened herself more rigidly than ever and said these bitter words, "Miss Morton is the daughter of Lord Morton."</t3912>
<t3913>Fanny also looked very angry; her husband, on the other hand, seemed to be horrified by his sister's insolence.</t3913> <t3914>Elinor was more offended by Marianne's fervor than by the things that caused that fervor; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, fixed on Marianne for the duration, spoke of a loving heart that saw only the admirable aspect of this action, unable to bear the slightest disdain for her sister.</t3914>
<t3915>Marianne's feelings did not stop there.</t3915> <t3916>To her, the cold arrogance in Mrs. Ferrars' general demeanor towards her sister foretold the difficulties and troubles that lay ahead for Elinor, as her own wounded heart had taught her to think in horror; moved by a strong spark of affectionate sensitivity, she immediately rose, went to her sister, wrapped an arm around her neck, pressed her cheek to hers, and said in a low but brave voice,</t3916>
<t3917>"Elinor, my dear, don't pay attention to these things.</t3917> <t3918>Don't let them make you unhappy.</t3918><t3919>"</t3919>
<t3920>She could not speak any longer; her spirit was utterly crushed, and she buried her face in Elinor's shoulder, bursting into tears.</t3920> <t3921>-Everyone suddenly became attentive, and everyone seemed to be worried.</t3921> <t3922>-Colonel Brandon stood up and, not knowing what he was doing, went over to them.</t3922> <t3923>-Mrs. Jennings, with a very wise "Oh, poor thing!" handed her some cologne; Sir John felt such a fierce anger towards the creator of this nervous crisis that he immediately changed his seat, moved next to Lucy Steele, and gave her a brief summary of the whole shocking incident.</t3923>
<t3924>Nevertheless, within a few minutes, Marianne recovered enough to put an end to the panic and sat with the others; but her spirit bore the traces of what had happened throughout the evening.</t3924>
<t3925>"Poor Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice, once he managed to get his attention, -"Her health is not as good as her sister's, -very nervous, -she doesn't have Elinor's fortitude; -we must admit that it is difficult for a young woman who was once beautiful to lose her personal charm.</t3925> <t3926>You might not believe it, but Marianne was extremely beautiful a few months ago; as beautiful as Elinor.</t3926> <t3927>-But you see, there is no beauty left now.</t3927><t3928>"</t3928>
<t3929>Elinor's curiosity about Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.</t3929> <t3930>-The woman's everything made the possibility of establishing a closer relationship between the families undesirable.</t3930> <t3931>-She had seen enough of her pride, vulgarity, and determined prejudice against her; even if Edward were already free, she understood all the difficulties that would complicate his association with her and delay their marriage; -she was thankful enough to see that a greater obstacle prevented him from suffering under the obstacles created by Mrs. Ferrars, protecting him from being dependent on the woman's whims or feeling the need to please her for his own good.</t3931> <t3932>At least, even if she didn't feel like being happy that Edward was engaged to Lucy, she thought she should be happy if Lucy were a better person.</t3932>
<t3933>She was surprised that Lucy could be so delighted by Mrs. Ferrars' interest; -that her opportunism and love of show could blind her so much to the fact that she was receiving attention only because she was not Elinor, that she could consider this a compliment to herself -or that she could accept taking courage from a privilege granted to her only because the true situation was unknown, she was surprised.</t3933> <t3934>But it was not only at that moment that this was evident from Lucy's eyes; it was more clearly and repeatedly declared the next morning, because Lady Middleton dropped her off at Berkeley Street upon her special request, to tell Elinor how happy she was if she found her alone.</t3934>
<t3935>He got lucky; a message from Mrs. Palmer right after him got Mrs. Jennings out of the house.</t3935>
<t3936>"Dear friend," cried Lucy the moment they were alone, "I have come to tell you about my happiness.</t3936> <t3937>Could anything be more flattering than Mrs. Ferrars' behavior towards me yesterday?</t3937> <t3938>She was incredibly charming!</t3938> <t3939>-You know how terrified I was at the thought of seeing her; -but the moment I was introduced, there was such warmth in her manner that it felt as if she was truly telling me she had taken a great liking to me.</t3939> <t3940>Wasn't it so?</t3940> <t3941>-You saw it all; weren't you affected by what happened?</t3941><t3942>"</t3942>
<t3943>"He was really kind to you."</t3943><t3944>"</t3944>
<t3945>"Polite! -Haven't you seen anything other than politeness?</t3945> <t3946>-I have seen much more.</t3946> <t3947>No one else has received such politeness as I have!</t3947> <t3948>-No arrogance, no show, your sister-in-law is the same -Such sweetness, such friendliness!</t3948><t3949>"</t3949>
<t3950>Elinor wanted to talk about other things, but Lucy insisted that she had a reason to be happy; Elinor had to continue-</t3950>
<t3951>"Surely, if they knew you were articulate," he said, "nothing could be more flattering than the way they treat you; -but since that is not the case"-</t3951>
<t3952>"I knew you would say that," replied Lucy quickly. "There was no reason for Mrs. Ferrars to pretend to like me if she didn't; her liking me means a lot. You can't diminish my joy with your words."</t3952> <t3953>I am sure everything will end well, there won't be any difficulties, in the matter I am thinking about.</t3953> <t3954>Mrs. Ferrars is an attractive woman, and so is your aunt.</t3954> <t3955>Both are truly delightful women!</t3955> <t3956>-For some reason, I never hear you say how charming Mrs. Dashwood is!</t3956><t3957>"</t3957>
<t3958>Elinor had no answer to give to this, nor did she attempt to give one.</t3958>
<t3959>"Are you ill, Miss Dashwood? -you look unwell -you are not speaking; -of course, you are not well.</t3959><t3960>"</t3960>
<t3961>"I have never been better."</t3961><t3962>"</t3962>
<t3963>"I am wholeheartedly happy about this, but you truly do not look well.</t3963> <t3964>Seeing you ill makes me sad.</t3964> <t3965>You have been my greatest support in this world!</t3965> <t3966>-God knows what I would do without your friendship.</t3966> <t3967>"-</t3967>
<t3968>Elinor tried to give a polite answer, though she wasn't sure if she could manage it.</t3968> <t3969>But Lucy seemed satisfied, because she immediately replied,</t3969>
<t3970>"Of course, I am sure that you love me, and this is my greatest assurance after Edward's love.</t3970> <t3971>-Poor Edward! But now there is a good thing; we can meet, even frequently, because Lady Middleton likes Mrs. Dashwood, so I think we will go to Harley Street quite often; Edward also spends half of his time with his sister - moreover, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will come to visit now; -Mrs. Ferrars and your aunt are so kind that they have said many times that they would always be happy to see you.</t3971> <t3972>-What charming women!</t3972> <t3973>-Believe me, if you were to tell your aunt my thoughts about her, you wouldn't be able to praise her enough.</t3973><t3974>"</t3974>
<t3975>Aunt Elinor did not encourage her to hope that she would say anything to her sister-in-law.</t3975> <t3976>Lucy continued.</t3976>
<t3977>"If Mrs. Ferrars didn't like me, I'm sure I would notice it right away.</t3977> <t3978>Even if she had just given me a formal greeting, for instance, without saying a single word, and then never looked at me, or even if she had looked at me in an unpleasant way - you know, in that kind of cold manner, I would have given up on everything in despair.</t3978> <t3979>I couldn't bear it.</t3979> <t3980>Because I know, when she doesn't like someone, she creates storms.</t3980><t3981>"</t3981>
<t3982>Elinor was prevented from replying to this polite victory by the opening of the door at that moment; the servant announced Mr. Ferrars and immediately afterward, Edward entered.</t3982>
<t3983>It was a very strange moment; the strangeness was read on each of their faces.</t3983> <t3984>They all looked extremely bewildered; Edward seemed to want to step back outside rather than enter the room further.</t3984> <t3985>The situation each of them would most want to avoid had come upon them in its most unpleasant form - Not only were the three of them together, but they were together without the comfort of having other people around.</t3985> <t3986>The ladies composed themselves first.</t3986> <t3987>It was not for Lucy to put herself forward; the appearance of secrecy still had to be maintained.</t3987> <t3988>So all she could do was put on her charm; after responding to him, she said nothing more.</t3988>
<t3989>Elinor had much more to do; she so wanted to do well what she had to do for Edward and for herself that she pushed herself and, after a moment's effort, welcomed him with a look and demeanor that could be considered relaxed and open; with a little more struggle and effort, she felt even more at ease.</t3989> <t3990>She would not allow the presence of Lucy or the thought of being wronged to prevent her from saying that she was glad to see him, that she was very sorry he was not at home when she visited Berkeley Street earlier.</t3990> <t3991>She would not be afraid to show him the closeness he deserved to see as a friend and almost a relative, just because Lucy's watchful eyes were there, even though she soon noticed Lucy watching them sideways.</t3991>
<t3992>His behavior gave Edward a little courage; he dared to sit down; but his discomfort was still much greater than that of the ladies, which, given the situation, was normal, although it didn't quite suit his gender; because he had neither the indifference of Lucy in his heart, nor the ease of Elinor in his conscience.</t3992>
<t3993>Lucy, with a gentle and calm demeanor, seemed determined not to contribute to the comfort of others and did not utter a single word; every word spoken, about her mother's health, their arrival in the city, and so on, came from Elinor, who had to be willing to give detailed answers to the questions Edward should have asked but did not.</t3993>
<t3994>His efforts did not stop there; immediately after, under the pretext of bringing Marianne, he felt inclined to make a heroic decision to leave the others alone and did so, in a very elegant manner, because before going to his sister, he lingered on the landing for a few minutes with noble determination.</t3994> <t3995>However, after this, the time came for Edward's joy to end; because Marianne's joy immediately dragged him into the living room as well.</t3995> <t3996>Marianne's joy upon seeing him was like all her other emotions, strong in itself, and its expression was strong as well.</t3996> <t3997>She came forward with an outstretched hand waiting to be held and a voice full of sisterly love.</t3997>
<t3998>"Dear Edward!" she exclaimed, "this is such a happy moment!</t3998> <t3999>-This makes me forget almost everything!</t3999><t4000>"</t4000>
<t4001>Edward tried to reciprocate her interest as it deserved, but he couldn't say even half of what he truly felt in front of such witnesses.</t4001> <t4002>They all sat down together again, and for a minute or two, everyone was silent; Marianne, with the most expressive affection, looked from Edward to Elinor, resenting that the happiness they could derive from each other was hindered by Lucy's unnecessary presence.</t4002> <t4003>Edward was the first to speak, drawing attention to Marianne's altered appearance and suggesting that she probably did not find London to her liking.</t4003>
<t4004>"Yo! Don't worry about me!" Marianne replied in a cheerful voice, though her eyes were tearing up as she spoke, "Don't worry about my health.</t4004> <t4005>Elinor is fine, you see.</t4005> <t4006>That should be enough for both of us.</t4006><t4007>"</t4007>
<t4008>This statement was neither intended to comfort Edward or Elinor, nor was it said to infuriate Lucy, who looked up at him with an expression that was far from kind.</t4008>
<t4009>"Did you like London?" said Edward, with a desire to say something that could open another topic.</t4009>
<t4010>"I never liked it.</t4010> <t4011>I was hoping to have a lot of fun, but I found no enjoyment at all.</t4011> <t4012>Seeing you, Edward, was the only happiness London gave me; thank God!</t4012> <t4013>You are just the same as you used to be!</t4013><t4014>"</t4014>
<t4015>It was silent - no one spoke.</t4015>
<t4016>"I suppose, Elinor," she added then, "we will take Edward with us to keep an eye on us when we return to Barton.</t4016> <t4017>In a week or two, I think we will go; I hope Edward will not object too much to this duty.</t4017><t4018>"</t4018>
<t4019>Poor Edward mumbled something, but no one understood, not even himself.</t4019> <t4020>But Marianne, who saw his excitement and attributed it to whatever would please him the most, was quite pleased and immediately started talking about something else.</t4020>
<t4021>"Yesterday we had such a day on Harley Street, Edward! So boring, so miserably boring!</t4021> <t4022>-I have a lot to tell you about it, but I can't tell you now.</t4022><t4023>"</t4023>
<t4024>And with this admirable willpower, she postponed telling him that she found their mutual relatives more unpleasant than ever, and that she particularly did not like her mother, to a time when they would be more alone.</t4024>
<t4025>"So why weren't you there, Edward? -Why didn't you come?</t4025><t4026>"</t4026>
<t4027>"I had another promise."</t4027><t4028>"</t4028>
<t4029>"Promise! -But what would it matter, when you have the chance to meet such friends?"</t4029><t4030>"</t4030>
<t4031>"Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, with a desire for revenge, "you think that young men never keep their promises, that they have no intention of keeping their word, whether it is important or not."</t4031><t4032>"</t4032>
<t4033>Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed not to have noticed the jab at all, because she replied,</t4033>
<t4034>"Yes, really; because I am serious, I think the only thing keeping Edward away from Harley Street is his conscience.</t4034> <t4035>I truly believe that he has the most sensitive conscience in the world; even if it's small, even if he doesn't like it or it doesn't suit him, he is extremely meticulous about fulfilling every promise he makes.</t4035> <t4036>Among everyone I know, he is the one most afraid of causing pain, disappointing expectations, and the least capable of being selfish.</t4036> <t4037>That's right, Edward, I will say it.</t4037> <t4038>What, will you never hear yourself being praised!</t4038> <t4039>-Then you cannot be my friend; because those who deserve my love and respect must submit to my open praises.</t4039><t4040>"</t4040>
<t4041>However, at that moment, the nature of his praises turned out to be quite inappropriate for the feelings of two-thirds of his listeners, and it even bothered Edward so much that he got up to leave shortly thereafter.</t4041>
<t4042>"Are you leaving so soon?" said Marianne; "dear Edward, it can't be.</t4042><t4043>"</t4043>
<t4044>And he pulled him aside a little and whispered that he believed Lucy could not stay any longer.</t4044> <t4045>But even this attempt to encourage did not work, because Edward left; and Lucy, who would stay longer even if his visit lasted two hours, soon followed him.</t4045>
<t4046>"What could be bringing her here so often!" said Marianne, after Lucy left.</t4046> <t4047>"Can't she see that we want her to go!</t4047> <t4048>-How boring for Edward!</t4048><t4049>"</t4049>
<t4050>"Why! -we are all his friends; in fact, Lucy has known him the longest.</t4050> <t4051>It is quite natural for her to want to see him as much as we do.</t4051><t4052>"</t4052>
<t4053>Marianne looked at her carefully and said, "You know, Elinor, this is a manner of speaking that you can't stand at all.</t4053> <t4054>If you just want your claim to be disputed, which I think is the case, you should remember that I am the last person in the world to do that.</t4054> <t4055>It is not possible for me to be deceitfully persuaded out of what I believe unless absolutely necessary.</t4055><t4056>"</t4056>
<t4057>Then he left the room; Elinor did not dare to follow him to say more; the promise of secrecy she had given to Lucy tied her hands, so she could not make any explanation to convince Marianne; even though the consequences of possibly being wrong were painful, she had to keep her word.</t4057> <t4058>All she could hope for was that Edward would either</t4058>
<t4059>It was that she often did not subject herself to the trouble of listening to Marianne's misguided interest and the repetition of the pain that lingered from their last encounters - and she had every reason to hope for this.</t4059>
<t4060>Chapter XIV</t4060>
<t4061>A few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the world that Thomas Palmer's wife had given birth to a healthy boy and heir; it was a very interesting and satisfying paragraph, at least for the close acquaintances awaiting the birth.</t4061>
<t4062>This event, which was very important for Mrs. Jennings' happiness, caused a temporary change in her use of time and equally affected the daily lives of her young friends; as she wanted to be with Charlotte often, she would go there every morning as soon as she got dressed and would not return until late in the evening; Miss Dashwoods, too, spent the entire day at Conduit Street at the insistence of the Middletons.</t4062> <t4063>They would have preferred to stay at Mrs. Jennings' house in the mornings for their own comfort, but they could not go against everyone's wishes.</t4063> <t4064>Therefore, their time was supposedly dedicated to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, who claimed to want them very much but valued their friendship very little.</t4064>
<t4065>They were too intelligent to be good friends for Lady Middleton, while the other two looked at them with jealous eyes, thinking that they were encroaching on their territory and taking a share of the favor they wanted to monopolize.</t4065> <t4066>Although Lady Middleton's behavior towards Elinor and Marianne was extremely polite, she did not actually like them at all.</t4066> <t4067>She did not believe they were good-natured because they did not compliment either her or her children.</t4067>
<t4068>He was getting tired; he thought they were mocking because they were fond of reading: maybe he didn't know exactly what it meant to be mocking, but it didn't matter.</t4068> <t4069>In everyday usage, it means reproach and is easily used.</t4069>
<t4070>Their presence was putting pressure on both him and Lucy.</t4070> <t4071>It highlighted one's idleness and the other's opportunism.</t4071> <t4072>Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing in front of them; Lucy feared they would scorn her for the compliments she was proud to think of and express at other times.</t4072> <t4073>Miss Steele was the least disturbed by their presence among the three, and it was entirely within their power to draw her to their side.</t4073> <t4074>For one of them to tell her a detailed story about the matter between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby would be enough for her to feel she had been amply rewarded for the sacrifice of losing the best spot by the fire after dinner because they had come.</t4074> <t4075>But this opportunity was not given to her; although she often spoke words of pity to Elinor about her sister, and even a few times made remarks about the unfaithfulness of young men in front of Marianne, she failed to impress anyone, receiving only an indifferent look from Elinor and a look of disgust from Marianne.</t4075> <t4076>A slightly lighter effort could have made them her friends.</t4076> <t4077>If only they had laughed with her about the Doctor!</t4077> <t4078>But they were so little inclined to please her compared to others that if Sir John was dining out, she could spend the whole day without hearing any joke other than the ones she made to herself.</t4078>
<t4079>All these jealousies and discomforts were such inconceivable things for Mrs. Jennings that she thought it was delightful for the girls to be together and congratulated her young friends every night for having escaped from the company of an old foolish woman for so long.</t4079> <t4080>Sometimes she joined them at Sir John's, sometimes at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in a state of great cheerfulness, full of joy and peace, attributing Charlotte's good health to her own care, eager to give a detailed account of her condition, and finding only Miss Steele ready to listen to her.</t4080> <t4081>One thing really bothered her; she complained about it every day.</t4081> <t4082>Mr. Palmer held a view common among his gender but unbecoming of a father, that all children resembled each other; although Mrs. Jennings occasionally saw a striking resemblance between this baby and each of its relatives on both sides, there was no convincing the father of this; he was not persuaded that it did not resemble all other babies of the same age; he even refused to accept the innocent claim that it was the most beautiful baby in the world.</t4082>
<t4083>Now, I will tell you about a misfortune that befell Mrs. John Dashwood during that time.</t4083> <t4084>While her two sisters-in-law, along with Mrs. Jennings, were visiting her for the first time on Harley Street, another acquaintance dropped by - a situation that did not seem to bother her personally.</t4084> <t4085>But since the imaginations of other people lead them to make wrong judgments about our behavior, deciding based on appearances, one's happiness is somewhat left to chance.</t4085> <t4086>In this incident, as soon as this last lady heard the name Miss Dashwood and understood that they were Mr. Dashwood's sisters, her imagination allowed her to surpass both reality and possibilities, leading her to immediately conclude that they were staying on Harley Street; this misinterpretation resulted in her sending them an invitation, just like their brother and sister-in-law, to a small musical party she was hosting a few days later.</t4086> <t4087>As a result, Mrs. John Dashwood not only endured the trouble of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods but, worse, she also bore the ordeal of appearing to be warm towards them: after all, who could know that they wouldn't hope to go out with her a second time?</t4087> <t4088>True, she always had the power to disappoint them.</t4088> <t4089>But this was not enough; because people decide on a course of action they know to be wrong.</t4089>
<t4090>they feel hurt because they are expected to do better when they fail.</t4090>
<t4091>Marianne was gradually getting so used to going out every day that whether she went out or not was no longer an issue for her: she was calmly and indifferently preparing for her evening program, without expecting the slightest joy from any meeting, often not knowing until the last moment where and what kind of meeting it was.</t4091>
<t4092>She was extremely indifferent regarding her dress and appearance, so much so that the attention she gave throughout her preparation was not even half of the attention Miss Steele directed at her within the first five minutes after they came together.</t4092> <t4093>Nothing escaped her keen observation and general curiosity; she saw everything, she asked about everything; she was not at ease until she learned the price of every part of Marianne's dress; she could estimate the total number of dresses Marianne had better than Marianne herself, and she had not given up hope of learning how much the cleaning costs were per week and how much money she spent on herself each year before leaving.</t4093> <t4094>Moreover, the impudence of such inquiries usually ended with a compliment that, although often said to be pleasant, seemed to Marianne to be the greatest impudence; because after being subjected to the scrutiny of the value and quality of her dress, the color of her shoes, and the style of her hair, she was almost certain to hear something like, "you really look stunning, everyone will adore you."</t4094><t4095>"</t4095>
<t4096>That evening, he was sent to his brother's car with such praise; after coming to the door and waiting, they were ready to get into the car within five minutes. 3iıi3 Their sister-in-law did not find this punctuality reasonable: she had gone to the house of her acquaintance before them and was expecting that they would cause trouble for her or her driver by being late.</t4096>
<t4097>There was nothing particularly noteworthy about the evening.</t4097> <t4098>The party, like all other musical parties, had brought together many people who genuinely enjoyed the performance and many who were indifferent to it; the performers, as always, were the first private performers in England in their own eyes and in the eyes of their close friends.</t4098>
<t4099>Since Elinor had no inclination towards music and did not pretend otherwise, she saw no harm in turning her eyes away from the piano whenever she wished; without being influenced by the presence of a harp or a cello, she freely directed her gaze to other things in the room as she pleased.</t4099> <t4100>In one of these wandering glances, she saw someone among a group of young men, the person who had given them a lesson on toothpick holders at Gray's shop.</t4100> <t4101>She saw him just after he had looked at her; he was conversing earnestly with her brother; she had just decided to ask her brother his name when both of them came towards her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced him as Mr. Robert Ferrars.</t4101>
<t4102>The young man treated her with an easy politeness; he bent his head in such a way that Elinor understood as clearly as if it were described in words that he was exactly the fop Lucy had described.</t4102><t4103>If only his respect for Edward had been based on his own merits rather than those of his closest relatives!</t4103><t4104>For then his brother's greeting would have dealt the final blow to the unpleasantness initiated by his mother and sister.</t4104><t4105>But while marveling at the difference between the two young men, she realized that the shallowness and pretentiousness of one did not at all diminish the humility and affection for the other's worth.</t4105><t4106>Robert himself explained why they were different within a quarter of an hour of an hour-long conversation; for while speaking of his brother, he lamented the excessive shyness he believed prevented him from entering suitable circles, attributing it sincerely and generously not to any natural flaw but to the unfortunate circumstance of receiving a private education; whereas he, despite having no particular feature or significant personal superiority, was, perhaps due to the privilege of attending a public school, just as fit for social interaction as anyone.</t4106>
<t4107>"Absolutely," he added, "I believe there is nothing else; seeing that you are worried about the situation, I often tell my mother the same."</t4107>
<t4108>I say.</t4108> <t4109>'Dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'rest assured.</t4109> <t4110>There is no cure for this trouble anymore; this is entirely your doing.</t4110> <t4111>Why did you allow my uncle Sir Robert to persuade you and send Edward to a private tutor at the most critical period of his life?</t4111> <t4112>If you had sent him to Westminster like me instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's place, all of this could have been prevented.'</t4112> <t4113>I always approach the matter this way, and my mother is well aware of her mistake.</t4113><t4114>"</t4114>
<t4115>Elinor did not object to this view, because regardless of her general thoughts on the benefits of public school, she could not think of Edward staying with Mr. Pratt's family without feeling bored.</t4115>
<t4116>"You live in Devonshire, I believe," was the next remark; "in a cottage near Dawlish."</t4116><t4117>"</t4117>
<t4118>Elinor made a correction regarding the location; Robert seemed surprised that one could live in Devonshire without living near Dawlish.</t4118> <t4119>Nevertheless, he bestowed heartfelt praises on houses like theirs.</t4119>
<t4120>"As for myself," he said, "I am extremely fond of cottages; there is always something very comfortable, very elegant about cottages.</t4120> <t4121>If I had the money to spare, I would buy a small piece of land and build myself a cottage; it would be near London, so I could go whenever I wanted, take a few friends with me and be happy.</t4121> <t4122>I recommend everyone who is going to build to construct a cottage.</t4122> <t4123>My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day to get my opinion, and he laid out three different plans by the famous architect Bonomi in front of me.</t4123> <t4124>He asked me to choose the best one.</t4124> <t4125>'My dear Courtland,' I said, throwing all the plans into the fire at that moment, 'do not build any of them, whatever you do, build a cottage.'</t4125> <t4126>I think that's what will happen in the end.</t4126>
<t4127>"Some people think there is no comfort or spaciousness in a cottage; big mistake.</t4127> <t4128>Last month I was at my friend Elliott's place near Dartford.</t4128> <t4129>Lady Elliott wanted to throw a dance party.</t4129> <t4130>'But how can it be?' she said; 'Dear Ferrars, tell me how this can be done.</t4130> <t4131>There is no room in this cottage for ten couples, where will the food be?' </t4131> <t4132>But I immediately saw there was no difficulty and said, 'Dear Lady Elliott, be at ease.</t4132> <t4133>The dining room comfortably holds eighteen people; game tables can be placed in the living room; the library can be open for tea and other drinks; and the food can be served in the hall.' Lady Elliott loved the idea.</t4133> <t4134>We measured the dining room and saw it would hold exactly eighteen people; everything was then arranged exactly according to my plan.</t4134> <t4135>So, you see, if people know how to organize, every comfort of the most spacious place can be provided in a cottage as well.</t4135><t4136>"</t4136>
<t4137>Elinor accepted all of this, because a sensible and well-behaved objection would be an undeserved compliment to the other party.</t4137>
<t4138>Since John Dashwood was no more interested in music than his older sister, his mind was free to be concerned with everything else; during the meeting, an idea came to mind and when they got home, he told his wife about it to get her approval.</t4138> <t4139>Thinking about Mrs. Denison's mistake of assuming her sisters were guests, it occurred to him that it would be appropriate to invite them as guests when Mrs. Jennings was away from home.</t4139> <t4140>The cost would be minimal, and the inconvenience would not be too great; his conscience told him that this attention was necessary to completely free himself from the promise he made to his father.</t4140> <t4141>When Fanny heard the proposal, she jumped up from her seat.</t4141>
<t4142>"I don't know how it would be," she said, "there's the risk of offending Lady Middleton, because they spend every day with her; otherwise, of course, I would be very happy.</t4142> <t4143>You know, I am always ready to show them all the closeness I can, and taking them out tonight already shows that.</t4143> <t4144>But they are Lady Middleton's guests.</t4144> <t4145>How can I tell them to stay away from her?</t4145><t4146>"</t4146>
<t4147>Despite all his gentleness, her husband did not see the strength of her objection.</t4147> <t4148>"Anyway, they spent a week on Conduit Street this way; Lady Middleton won't be upset if they allocate the same number of days to such close relatives.</t4148><t4149>"</t4149>
<t4150>Fanny paused for a moment, then said with renewed effort,</t4150>
<t4151>"My dear, if it were up to me, I would want them with all my heart.</t4151> <t4152>But I had just decided to ask the Miss Steeles to stay with us for a few days.</t4152> <t4153>They are very good-natured, agreeable girls; I think they deserve attention, because their uncle put a lot of effort into Edward.</t4153> <t4154>We can invite your sisters another year; but the Miss Steeles might not be able to come to town again.</t4154> <t4155>I'm sure you will love them very much; in fact, you already do, and so does my mother; Harry is also very fond of them!</t4155><t4156>"</t4156>
<t4157>Mr. Dashwood was convinced.</t4157> <t4158>He immediately grasped the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles and his conscience was eased by the decision to invite his sisters next year; but at the same time, he shrewdly suspected that next year’s invitation would be rendered unnecessary by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon’s wife and Marianne as their guest.</t4158>
<t4159>Fanny, who was pleased to have escaped and proud of the quick wit that had saved her, wrote to Lucy the next day, inviting her and her sister to Harley Street for a few days as soon as Lady Middleton gave them permission.</t4159> <t4160>This was enough to truly and justifiably make Lucy happy.</t4160> <t4161>Mrs. Dashwood genuinely seemed to be working for her; she was keeping her hopes alive and supporting her views!</t4161> <t4162>Such an opportunity for association with Edward and his family was very important for her purposes, and such an invitation was an honor for her!</t4162> <t4163>No amount of thanks or quick utilization could suffice for this privilege; it was immediately noticed that the visit to Lady Middleton, which previously had no definite limits, was actually just two days long.</t4163>
<t4164>When the letter was shown to Elinor, which was within ten minutes of its arrival, it made Elinor share a bit of Lucy's expectations for the first time; because such an extraordinary sign of kindness bestowed upon such a short acquaintance seemed to indicate that the goodwill towards Lucy stemmed from something beyond mere ill-will towards Elinor, and that with time and patience, Lucy could be persuaded to achieve whatever she wished.</t4164> <t4165>The compliments had already overcome Lady Middleton's pride and opened the door to Mrs. John Dashwood's heart; these were effects that made greater successes possible.</t4165>
<t4166>Miss Steele and Miss Harley moved to Harley Street; the news Elinor received about their influence there strengthened her expectations regarding the event.</t4166> <t4167>Sir John, who visited them several times, brought back reports of how warmly they were received at home, as should be found interesting by everyone.</t4167> <t4168>Mrs. Dashwood had never admired any young women as much as she did them; she had given each of them an embroidery book made by an immigrant; she called Lucy by her first name; she did not know how she could bear to part with them.</t4168>
<t4169>THIRD BOOK</t4169>
<t4170>Mrs. Palmer was so well fifteen days later that her mother no longer felt it necessary to devote all her time to her; she was content to visit her once or twice a day and returned to her own home and habits, where she found the Miss Dashwoods ready to reclaim their former share.</t4170>
<t4171>A few mornings after they had thus settled again on Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, upon returning from her usual visit to Mrs. Palmer, entered the sitting room where she found Elinor sitting alone, with an air of hurried importance as if preparing her to hear something wonderful, and immediately began to speak, proving that her demeanor was justified, giving Elinor only a moment to gather her thoughts.</t4171>
<t4172>"My God! Dear Miss Dashwood! Have you heard the news?</t4172><t4173>"</t4173>
<t4174>"No, sir.</t4174> <t4175>What is it?</t4175><t4176>"</t4176>
<t4177>"Such a strange thing!</t4177> <t4178>But you will learn everything.</t4178> <t4179>-When I went to Mr. Palmer's house, I found Charlotte in a complete panic about the child.</t4179> <t4180>She was saying the child was very sick - the child was crying and whining, covered in rashes.</t4180> <t4181>I took a look and said, 'My God!' I said, 'my dear, this child is just teething;' the nurse said the same thing.</t4181> <t4182>But Charlotte was not satisfied, Mr. Donavan was called immediately; fortunately, he had just returned from Harley Street, came straight away; as soon as he saw the child, he said the same thing as us-</t4182>
<t4183>She said it's just teething, and only then did Charlotte feel relieved.</t4183> <t4184>Then, just as the doctor was about to leave, it occurred to me, I don't know how I thought of it, to ask if there was any news.</t4184> <t4185>Upon this, he grinned, then became serious, indicating he knew something, and finally whispered in my ear, 'I fear your young lady guests might hear about their aunt's illness, but I don't think there's much to worry about; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will recover.'</t4185><t4186>'"</t4186>
<t4187>"What! Is Fanny sick?</t4187><t4188>"</t4188>
<t4189>"I said exactly the same, my dear.</t4189> <t4190>'My God!' I said, 'Is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' Then everything became clear; the essence of the matter, as I learned, seems to be like this.</t4190> <t4191>Mr. Edward Ferrars, you know the young man I teased you about (but honestly, I'm terribly glad there was nothing serious), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it appears, has been engaged to my cousin Lucy for a year! -here's the news for you!</t4191> <t4192>-No one except Nancy knew a single thing about the matter!</t4192> <t4193>-Could you believe such a thing could be possible?</t4193> <t4194>-There's nothing surprising about them liking each other; but who would have thought they would take it this far between them!</t4194> <t4195>This is strange! I never saw them together, otherwise, I'm sure I would have understood immediately.</t4195> <t4196>They kept it secret out of fear of Mrs. Ferrars, neither she nor the brother nor the sister-in-law suspected a thing, -but this morning poor Nancy, you know, she's well-meaning, but not very bright, blurted everything out.</t4196> <t4197>'My God!' she thought to herself, 'they all love Lucy so much they won't cause trouble;' so she went to the sister-in-law, who was sitting alone weaving a rug, not knowing what was about to happen to her -because she was just telling the brother, not five minutes before, that they were planning a marriage between Edward and Lord so-and-so's, I forgot who, daughter.</t4197> <t4198>You can imagine how her pride must have been struck.</t4198> <t4199>She immediately went into a violent hysterical fit, her screams reached the brother who was sitting in his room thinking about writing a letter to the steward in the village.</t4199> <t4200>The brother immediately got up and ran, and a terrible scene ensued, because Lucy also came to them at that moment, how could she know what had happened.</t4200> <t4201>Poor thing! I pity her.</t4201> <t4202>But I think she was treated badly; because the sister-in-law scolded her with such fury that the girl fainted.</t4202> <t4203>Nancy also knelt down and cried bitterly; the brother paced up and down the room saying he didn't know what to do.</t4203> <t4204>Mrs. Dashwood told them not to stay in the house for a moment, and the brother asked them to stay only until they packed their things.</t4204> <t4205>Then the sister-in-law had another hysterical fit, the brother was so scared that he called Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in an uproar.</t4205> <t4206>The carriage was ready at the door to take my poor cousins away, and as he arrived, they were just stepping out; poor Lucy was in such a state that she could barely walk; Nancy was almost as bad.</t4206> <t4207>Believe me, I can't stand the sister-in-law; with all my heart, I hope they get married despite her.</t4207> <t4208>My God! Poor Mr. Edward will be in such a difficult situation when he hears about it!</t4208> <t4209>To have his beloved insulted like that!</t4209> <t4210>Because they say he's in love with her, which is possible.</t4210> <t4211>I wouldn't be surprised, even if he were madly in love!</t4211> <t4212>-Mr. Donavan is of the same opinion.</t4212> <t4213>We talked quite a bit; the good news is that he returned to Harley Street, so he can be around and listen in when the matter is explained to Mrs. Ferrars, because they called him as soon as my cousins left the house, as the sister-in-law was sure he would have a fit too; let him have it, I don't care.</t4213> <t4214>I don't pity either of them.</t4214> <t4215>I don't think it's right for people to make such a fuss over money and nobility.</t4215> <t4216>There is no reason in the world why Mr. Edward and Lucy shouldn't get married; because I'm sure Mrs. Ferrars has the means to support her son well; even if Lucy has almost nothing of her own, she knows how to make the best of everything better than anyone; I think if Mrs. Ferrars gave her just five hundred a year, she would manage to look as good as someone else with eight hundred.</t4216> <t4217>My God! How comfortably they would live in a cottage like yours -or a slightly bigger one -with two maids and two servants; I would even help them find the maids, because my Betty has an unemployed sister who would be perfect for them.</t4217><t4218>"</t4218>
<t4219>Here Mrs. Jennings paused; Elinor, having the opportunity to gather her thoughts, would be able to give a response and make an observation as the subject might require.</t4219> <t4220>She was happy to see that it was no longer suspected that Mrs. Jennings thought she had a relationship with Edward (something she had often wished for recently); most of all, she was happy that she could speak about the matter without any discomfort while Marianne was absent and express her impartial opinion about the behavior of everyone involved.</t4220>
<t4221>She couldn't decide what her own expectations regarding the event might be; although she sincerely tried to dismiss the thought that it could end in any other way than Edward marrying Lucy.</t4221> <t4222>Even though she could predict what Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, she very much wanted to hear it; she wanted even more to learn how Edward would behave.</t4222> <t4223>She felt very sorry for him; for Lucy, she felt very little - and she had to make an effort to feel even that little; for the others, she felt no pity at all.</t4223>
<t4224>Mrs. Jennings immediately realized that since she couldn't talk about anything else, she needed to prepare Elinor to discuss Marianne.</t4224> <t4225>She should not waste any time in explaining what had been kept from her, telling her the truth, and getting her used to hearing about it from others without showing any discomfort for her sister or resentment towards Edward.</t4225>
<t4226>Elinor's task was painful.</t4226> <t4227>She would destroy what she believed to be her sister's only solace, -she would ruin Edward's reputation in Marianne's eyes, and by drawing a strong parallel between their situations, she would recount specific details that would make Marianne relive her own disappointment.</t4227> <t4228>Such a task, though unpleasant, had to be done; Elinor hurried to fulfill it.</t4228>
<t4229>She had no intention of dwelling on her own feelings, or of explaining how much she herself had suffered, except for her effort to maintain the composure she had shown since first hearing of Edward's engagement, as these could be signs Marianne might cling to.</t4229> <t4230>Her story was clear and simple; it was impossible to tell it without emotion, but it did not involve intense excitement or severe pain.</t4230> <t4231>-These were more for the listener, for Marianne listened in horror and cried uncontrollably.</t4231> <t4232>Elinor, while in her own sorrow, had to comfort others as much as she could; she immediately offered all the consolation she could by sincerely defending that her spirits were high and that Edward was innocent in every respect except for his lack of judgment.</t4232>
<t4233>But Marianne did not believe either of them for a while.</t4233> <t4234>Edward became a second Willoughby; she had loved Willoughby so deeply that Elinor could not have loved him any less!</t4234> <t4235>As for Lucy Steele, she found her so terribly unpleasant and so lacking in the ability to attract a sensible man that she was unwilling to believe that Edward had ever been in love with her at first, or to forgive him for it.</t4235> <t4236>She did not even accept that it was natural; Elinor left her to believe in its naturalness on her own, the only way to make her believe, by getting to know people better.</t4236>
<t4237>Elinor's initial explanation went no further than expressing the reality of the engagement and how long it had existed.</t4237> <t4238>-Marianne had then collapsed, and Elinor had put an end to all ordinary details; for a while, all she could do was to convey her sorrow, alleviate her fears, and struggle with her resentment.</t4238> <t4239>Marianne's first question, which paved the way for further details, was this,</t4239>
<t4240>"How long have you known, Elinor?</t4240> <t4241>Did he write to you?</t4241><t4242>"</t4242>
<t4243>"I have known for four months.</t4243> <t4244>When Lucy came to Barton Park last November, she secretly told me about the engagement.</t4244><t4245>"</t4245>
<t4246>A look of astonishment appeared in Marianne's eyes that her lips could not express in response to these words.</t4246> <t4247>After pausing in amazement, she cried out,</t4247>
<t4248>"Four months! -Have you known for four months?"</t4248><t4249>Elinor said, "Yes."</t4249>
<t4250>"No! -while you were watching over me amidst all my suffering, did you carry this burden in your heart?"</t4250> <t4251>"-I was despising you because I thought you were happy!"</t4251> <t4252>""It wasn't right for you to know how far I was from being happy at that time."</t4252> <t4253>—</t4253>
<t4254>"Four months!" cried Marianne again.</t4254> <t4255>"So calm! -so cheerful! -how did you endure it?</t4255><t4256>" By thinking that I was doing my duty.</t4256> <t4257>" The promise I made to Lucy also compelled me to remain silent.</t4257> <t4258>I had an obligation not to even hint the truth to her; and I owed it to my family and friends not to cause them a worry that I couldn't resolve.</t4258><t4259>"</t4259>
<t4260>Marianne was stunned.</t4260><t4261>-</t4261>
<t4262>"I always wanted to explain it to you and mother," added Elinor; "I even tried once or twice; -but I couldn't convince you without breaking my promise.</t4262><t4263>"</t4263>
<t4264>"Four months! -and yet you loved him!</t4264> <t4265>""Yes.</t4265> <t4266>But I did not love only him; -the peace of others was also important to me, so I am glad that I protected them by not letting them know what I felt.</t4266> <t4267>Now I can think and talk about these things more comfortably.</t4267> <t4268>-I would not want you to suffer because of me; because I assure you, I no longer feel significant pain.</t4268> <t4269>There are many things in my life that support me.</t4269> <t4270>I know that I did not cause any disappointment due to my own thoughtlessness, and I tried to endure the disappointment that was caused as much as possible without spreading it around.</t4270> <t4271>-Edward is exonerated in my eyes in terms of all behavioral requirements. I wish him to be happy; I am as sure as my name that he did what he thought was his duty, so much so that even if he feels some regret now, he will eventually be happy.</t4271> <t4272>Lucy is a smart person; this is the foundation upon which every good thing can be built.</t4272> <t4273>-Besides Marianne, despite everything that can be said about the idea of a single and constant attachment being appealing, despite everything that can be said about a person's happiness being dependent on just one person, it is not easy -it is not appropriate -it is not possible for this to be so.</t4273> <t4274>Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman whose appearance and mind are superior to more than half of her peers; time and habit will teach him to forget that he once found someone else superior to his wife.</t4274> <t4275>""If you think this way," said Marianne, "if you can replace the thing you value most with something else so easily when you lose it, then your determination, your composure should perhaps be met with less surprise.</t4275> <t4276>-I understand these things better now.</t4276><t4277>"</t4277>
<t4278>"I understand you.</t4278> <t4279>-You don't think I have strong feelings.</t4279> <t4280>-For four months, Marianne, all of this has taken over my mind, without the freedom to speak to a single person; I knew that whenever it was explained to you, it would make both you and my mother very unhappy, yet I still couldn't prepare you for it even a little.</t4280> <t4281>-I was told, -it was forced upon me by the person involved themselves, and the fact that they were engaged before me shattered all my dreams, and they told me this, as I thought, with a sense of triumph.</t4281> <t4282>-Therefore, I tried to resist this person's suspicions by appearing indifferent, even though it concerned me closely; -and it wasn't just once; -I had to listen to their hopes and dreams repeatedly.</t4282> <t4283>-I told myself that I had lost Edward forever, without witnessing a single event that could make me want this union less.</t4283> <t4284>-Nothing has shown that he is a worthless person; nor has there been anything to show that he is indifferent to me.</t4284> <t4285>-I had to struggle against his sister's cruelty and his mother's arrogance, and I endured all the punishment of love without experiencing any of its pleasures.</t4285> <t4286>-And throughout all those days, as you well know, this was not my only misery.</t4286> <t4287>-If you think I am devoid of emotion -now you can easily accept that I am suffering.</t4287> <t4288>My calmness while thinking about the matter, the consolation I wanted to find for myself was possible only through continuous and painful effort; -they did not appear on their own; -they were not waiting ready to cheer me up -No Marianne.</t4288> <t4289>Otherwise, if I had not taken a vow of silence, perhaps nothing -not even my duties to my closest ones could have completely prevented me from showing how very unhappy I was.</t4289><t4290>"</t4290>
<t4291>Marianne was devastated. "Oh Elinor," she cried, "you have made me forever hate myself.</t4291> <t4292>-How cruelly I have treated you!</t4292> <t4293>-You who were my only comfort, you who endured all my misery, you who seemed to suffer only for me!</t4293> <t4294>-Is this my gratitude?</t4294> <t4295>-Is this the only response I can give you?</t4295> <t4296>-Your superior qualities made me feel so inadequate that I tried to ignore them.</t4296><t4297>"</t4297>
<t4298>This confession was followed by an embrace.</t4298> <t4299>Now she was in such a state of mind that Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining the promise she wanted from her; at her request, Marianne agreed not to speak of the matter to anyone in a way that would make her appear distressed, -not to show that she now disliked Lucy when she encountered her, -and even to see Edward himself, if they happened to meet, without diminishing her usual courtesy.</t4299> <t4300>-These were great sacrifices; -but whenever Marianne felt she had hurt someone, she would do everything she could to make amends.</t4300>
<t4301>She admirably fulfilled the promise of behaving carefully.</t4301> <t4302>-She listened to Mrs. Jennings' remarks on the matter without changing her facial expression, did not object to her in any way, and was even heard to say "Yes ma'am" three times.</t4302> <t4303>-She only listened to her praise of Lucy by changing the chair she was sitting in; when Mrs. Jennings spoke of Edward's love, she only felt a lump in her throat.</t4303> <t4304>-Seeing her sister's heroic behavior made Elinor feel incredibly strong.</t4304>
<t4305>The next morning, a new trial emerged with the visit of their elder brothers; they had come with a very serious demeanor to talk about the terrible matter and had brought news from his wife-</t4305>
<t4306>"I suppose," he said with great dignity, as soon as he sat down, "you must have heard about the shocking development that occurred under our roof yesterday."</t4306>
<t4307>They all nodded with their faces; it was as if it was a moment too sorrowful to speak.</t4307>
<t4308>"Your sister-in-law," he continued, "endured terrible things.</t4308> <t4309>So did Mrs. Ferrars - in short, such a bizarre and distressing scene unfolded - but I hope the storm was weathered without any of us being too harmed.</t4309> <t4310>Poor Fanny! She had fits all day yesterday.</t4310> <t4311>But I don't want to frighten you too much.</t4311> <t4312>Donavan said there is nothing to worry about; her constitution is strong, her will is omnipotent. She endured everything with angelic patience!</t4312> <t4313>She says she will never be kind to anyone again; one can't help but be surprised, after being so deceived! -show so much kindness, trust so much, and then receive such ingratitude!</t4313> <t4314>She invited these young ladies to the house purely out of generosity; she thought they deserved a little attention, that they were harmless, good-natured girls who would make good company; because otherwise, both of us wanted to invite you and Marianne, while your kind friend was looking after the girl there.</t4314> <t4315>And this is our reward!</t4315> <t4316>'I wish,' said poor Fanny in her loving voice, 'we had called their sisters instead of them.</t4316><t4317>'"</t4317>
<t4318>He paused here so they could thank him; they thanked him, and he continued.</t4318>
<t4319>"The ordeal poor Mrs. Ferrars endured when Fanny first brought up the matter is indescribable.</t4319> <t4320>While she was planning the best marriage for him with the most genuine feelings, could it be imagined that Edward had been secretly engaged to someone else all that time!</t4320> <t4321>-such a suspicion would never have crossed her mind!</t4321> <t4322>Even if she had suspected he had a connection somewhere, that place could not have been it.</t4322> <t4323>'On that front,' she said, 'I truly thought I was safe.'</t4323> <t4324>She was overwhelmed with agony.</t4324> <t4325>However, we sat down and discussed what could be done, and finally decided to summon Edward.</t4325> <t4326>He came.</t4326> <t4327>But it pains me to recount what happened next.</t4327> <t4328>No matter what Mrs. Ferrars said to break the engagement, no matter how much I supported her with my opinions, and Fanny with her pleas, it was to no avail.</t4328> <t4329>Duty, love, everything was ignored.</t4329> <t4330>I never knew Edward could be so stubborn, so unfeeling before.</t4330> <t4331>His mother explained her generous plans to him, that if he married Miss Morton, she would settle the Norfolk estate on him, an estate that, after taxes, would comfortably bring in a thousand pounds a year; she even raised the offer to twelve hundred pounds when the matter seemed hopeless; and she also explained the inevitable penalty that would result if he persisted in this lowly marriage.</t4331> <t4332>She told him she would take away his entire two thousand pounds, never see him again, and not give him a penny of support, and that if he took up a job for a better income, she would do everything in her power to hinder his progress in that job.</t4332><t4333>"</t4333>
<t4334>Here Marianne, in a fit of rage, clapped her hands and shouted, "Oh my God! Can this be possible?</t4334><t4335>"</t4335>
<t4336>"Honestly Marianne," replied her brother, "you can't be surprised enough at the stubbornness that resists these truths.</t4336> <t4337>Your reaction is quite natural.</t4337><t4338>"</t4338>
<t4339>Marianne was about to respond, but she remembered her promise and endured the situation.</t4339>
<t4340>"However, all of this," continued his brother, "was said in vain.</t4340> <t4341>Edward hardly spoke; but when he did, he spoke decisively.</t4341> <t4342>Nothing could persuade him to go back on his word.</t4342> <t4343>He would remain true to his word, no matter the cost.</t4343><t4344>"</t4344>
<t4345>"Then," cried Mrs. Jennings with fervent sincerity, no longer remaining silent, "he acted like an honorable man!</t4345> <t4346>I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had acted otherwise, I would have thought he was a scoundrel.</t4346> <t4347>I am somewhat involved in the matter just like you, because Lucy Steele is my cousin and in my opinion, there is no better girl in the world than her, nor a girl who deserves a good husband more.</t4347><t4348>"</t4348>
<t4349>John Dashwood was very surprised; but his nature was calm, he was not prone to provocation, and he did not want to offend anyone, especially not anyone wealthy.</t4349> <t4350>Therefore, he replied without taking offense,</t4350>
<t4351>"I would never want to speak disrespectfully of any of your relatives, Madam.</t4351> <t4352>Lucy Steele is, in my opinion, a young woman worthy of everything, but in this situation, you know, a family connection is impossible.</t4352> <t4353>Moreover, entering into a secret relationship with a young man entrusted to his uncle, especially with the son of a woman as wealthy as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps quite unusual.</t4353> <t4354>In short, I do not intend to pass judgment on the behavior of anyone you care about, Mrs. Jennings.</t4354> <t4355>We all want Lucy Steele to be very happy; Mrs. Ferrars' behavior from start to finish has been as any thoughtful, good mother would adopt under similar circumstances.</t4355> <t4356>It has been noble and generous.</t4356> <t4357>Edward made his choice, and I fear he made a poor one.</t4357><t4358>"</t4358>
<t4359>Marianne sighed as if to show she agreed; thinking about Edward's feelings while he resisted his mother's threats for a woman who could not reward him made Elinor's heart ache.</t4359>
<t4360>"Well, sir," said Mrs. Jennings, "how did the matter end?</t4360><t4361>"</t4361>
<t4362>"I regret to say, madam, it ended in the most unhappy separation: -Edward was forever erased from his mother's records.</t4362> <t4363>Yesterday he left his mother's house, but where he went, whether he is still in the city or not, I don't know; because we are, of course, investigating.</t4363><t4364>"</t4364>
<t4365>"Poor young man!</t4365> <t4366>-what will happen to him?</t4366><t4367>"</t4367>
<t4368>"It is truly so, madam!</t4368> <t4369>A sorrowful incident.</t4369> <t4370>To be born with such hope of wealth!</t4370> <t4371>I cannot think of a more pitiable situation.</t4371> <t4372>The interest on two thousand pounds - how does one live on that! - and then to remember that if it weren't for his own foolishness, he could have had twenty-five hundred a year within three months (because Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds), I cannot imagine myself in a more miserable state.</t4372> <t4373>We all pity him so much, as there is no way we can help him.</t4373><t4374>"</t4374>
<t4375>"Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I will host him in my house, feed him, give him a place to stay, and if I see him, I will tell him exactly this.</t4375> <t4376>It is not appropriate for him to live out of his own pocket in inns.</t4376><t4377>"</t4377>
<t4378>Elinor inwardly thanked Edward for this kindness, although she couldn't help but smile at the manner of the kindness.</t4378>
<t4379>"If he had thought about his own well-being as much as his friends wanted," said John Dashwood, "he would now be in a fitting situation and would lack nothing.</t4379> <t4380>But at present, no one can help him.</t4380> <t4381>Moreover, there is one more thing working against him that is worse than all - his mother has naturally decided to immediately transfer the property to Robert, which would have been Edward's under normal circumstances.</t4381> <t4382>This morning, I left him alone with the lawyer; they were discussing business.</t4382><t4383>"</t4383>
<t4384>"So," said Mrs. Jennings, "this is his revenge.</t4384> <t4385>Everyone has their own way.</t4385> <t4386>But my way wouldn't be like this, making one son wealthy because another son upset me.</t4386><t4387>"</t4387>
<t4388>Marianne stood up and began to walk around the room.</t4388>
<t4389>"For the human soul," continued John, "could anything be more hurtful than seeing a property that could be one's own pass into the possession of a brother?</t4389> <t4390>Poor Edward! I sincerely pity him.</t4390><t4391>"</t4391>
<t4392>In the same way, after spending a few more minutes pouring out his heart, John Dashwood ended his visit; after repeatedly telling his sisters that he believed there was no significant issue with Fanny's condition and that they didn't need to worry too much, he left; the three ladies were left with common feelings about the incident, at least as far as Mrs. Ferrars, the Dashwoods, and Edward's behavior were concerned.</t4392>
<t4393>As soon as they left the room, Marianne's anger burst forth; faced with her fury, it became impossible for Elinor to restrain herself and unnecessary for Mrs. Jennings to do so, so they all together made an effort to criticize those people</t4393><t4394>t</t4394><t4395>hem</t4395>
<t4396>Mrs. Jennings was fervently praising Edward's behavior, but only Elinor and Marianne truly understood its real value.</t4396> <t4397>Only they knew how little there was to provoke him into rebellion, how small the consolation of losing his loved ones and fortune was beyond doing what was right.</t4397> <t4398>Elinor was proud of his integrity; Marianne forgave all his faults because she pitied the punishment he received.</t4398> <t4399>But even if the trust between them was restored thanks to this news, it became a topic neither of them wanted to dwell on when they were alone.</t4399> <t4400>Elinor avoided it out of principle, because Marianne was trying to instill in her mind with very warm, very positive words the belief that Edward's love for her continued, and Elinor wanted to dismiss this from her mind; soon, Marianne's courage to speak on a matter where she felt far from satisfied with herself waned when she compared her own behavior to Elinor's.</t4400>
<t4401>He felt the full force of this comparison, but not in a way that would now drive him to make an effort as his sister had hoped; he felt it with all the pain of constantly belittling himself, bitterly regretting that he had not made an effort before; but this regret only turned into torture without any hope of improvement.</t4401> <t4402>His spirit had become so weak that, at this mo-</t4402>
<t4403>he found it impossible to make an effort, thus he was becoming even more powerless.</t4403>
<t4404>For the next couple of days, they didn't hear anything new about the matters on Harley Street or at the Bartlett Buildings: But although they already knew most of the incident, Mrs. Jennings, in her effort to spread this information further, must have neglected to acquire new information, so she decided to visit her cousins at the first opportunity to offer her condolences and check on them; during that time, nothing could prevent her from going to them except for having more visitors than usual.</t4404>
<t4405>The third day after they learned the details was such a mild, such a beautiful Sunday that it had drawn many people to Kensington Gardens, even though it was only the second week of March.</t4405> <t4406>Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were among these people; but knowing that the Willoughbys had returned to the city, Marianne, constantly fearing to encounter them, preferred to stay at home rather than go out.</t4406>
<t4407>Immediately after entering the park, a close acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them; Elinor was not at all upset that this person walked with them and kept Mrs. Jennings busy with conversation, as she was left alone with her own silent thoughts.</t4407> <t4408>She did not see the Willoughbys, she did not see Edward, in fact, for a while, she did not see anyone who could interest her, whether serious or cheerful.</t4408> <t4409>But eventually, she found herself face to face with Miss Steele in astonishment; although Miss Steele appeared a bit shy, she said she was very happy to have encountered them and, especially encouraged by Mrs. Jennings' kindness, left her own friends for a while to join them.</t4409> <t4410>Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,</t4410>
<t4411>"Learn everything, my dear.</t4411> <t4412>If you ask, she will tell you everything.</t4412> <t4413>You see, I can't leave Mrs. Clarke.</t4413><t4414>"</t4414>
<t4415>But both Mrs. Jennings' and Elinor's curiosity was quickly satisfied, because Miss Steele explained everything without waiting to be asked, otherwise nothing would have been learned.</t4415>
<t4416>"I am so glad to have found you," said Miss Steele, taking Elinor's arm - "because I wanted to see you more than anything in the world."</t4416> <t4417>Then she lowered her voice, "I think Mrs. Jennings has heard everything.</t4417> <t4418>Is she angry?</t4418><t4419>"</t4419>
<t4420>"It's probably not you.</t4420><t4421>"</t4421>
<t4422>"This is a good thing."</t4422> <t4423>"Well, Lady Middleton, is she angry?"</t4423><t4424>"</t4424>
<t4425>"I can't believe that she is angry."</t4425><t4426>"</t4426>
<t4427>"I was incredibly delighted by this.</t4427> <t4428>My God! What have I been through!</t4428> <t4429>I had never seen Lucy this angry in my life.</t4429> <t4430>First, she swore that she would never make me a new hat decoration again, and that she would never do anything for me as long as she lived; but now she has calmed down, and we are good as before.</t4430> <t4431>Look, last night she made this bow for my hat and added the feather.</t4431> <t4432>See, you will laugh at me too.</t4432> <t4433>Why shouldn't I wear a pink ribbon?</t4433> <t4434>What does it matter to me if it's the doctor's favorite color?</t4434> <t4435>Seriously, how could I have known that he liked it more than the other colors if he hadn't told me himself.</t4435> <t4436>My cousins have so much fun with me!</t4436> <t4437>-I sometimes say, I don't know which way to look in front of them.</t4437><t4438>"</t4438>
<t4439>Elinor had gotten caught up in a topic she wouldn't be interested in, so she thought it would be appropriate to return to the original topic shortly.</t4439>
<t4440>"Believe me, Miss Dashwood," he said, speaking as if he had won a victory, "no matter what people say about Mr. Ferrars not marrying Lucy, there is no such thing; it is very shameful for such malicious news to spread around.</t4440> <t4441>No matter what Lucy thinks about this, it is not up to anyone to say it is definitely over.</t4441><t4442>"</t4442>
<t4443>"Be assured, I have never heard of such a thing being mentioned before," said Elinor.</t4443>
<t4444>"Oh, really?</t4444> <t4445>But it was being said, I know very well, and by quite a few people; because Miss Godby told Miss Sparks that no one in their right mind would expect Mr. Ferrars to leave a woman like Miss Morton, who has a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, for Lucy Steele, who has nothing; I heard this directly from Miss Sparks.</t4445> <t4446>Additionally, my cousin Richard also said that when things get serious, Mr. Ferrars would just leave; and when Edward didn't come near us for three days, I didn't know what to think; it seems to me that Lucy has given up on everything; because we left your brother's house on Wednesday and didn't see him on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, we don't know what happened to him.</t4446> <t4447>Once, Lucy thought of writing to him but then didn't feel like it.</t4447> <t4448>However, Edward came this morning, just as we were returning from church; then everything was revealed, they had called him to Harley Street on Wednesday, his mother and others talked to him, and he told them all to their faces that he loved no one but Lucy and would marry no one but Lucy.</t4448> <t4449>What happened upset him so much that as soon as he left his mother's house, he jumped on his horse and went to some village; he stayed at an inn all Thursday and Friday to think the matter through thoroughly.</t4449> <t4450>After thinking it over repeatedly, he realized that now, since he has neither wealth nor anything else, it would be inconsiderate to expect Lucy to remain engaged, because now the loss is hers, as he has nothing but two thousand pounds, no hope, nothing; even if he enters the church as planned, he can only get a curacy, and how will they live on that little?</t4450> <t4451>-He couldn't bear the thought of Lucy not having a better life, so he asked, if she had the slightest thought, to end the matter immediately, so he could focus on his work.</t4451> <t4452>I heard that he said these things in the clearest way possible.</t4452> <t4453>If he mentioned separation, it was entirely for Lucy's sake, for her well-being, not because he was thinking of himself.</t4453> <t4454>I swear he didn't say a single word about being tired of her or wanting to marry Miss Morton or anything like that.</t4454> <t4455>But honestly, Lucy didn't pay any attention to such words; she directly told him (there were quite a few "my dear, my love" phrases, you understand, such words -Well, you know, one can't repeat such things) -she directly told him that the thought of separation never crossed her mind, because she would live with him under any circumstances, no matter how little money he had, she would be happy with him in any way, and so on, like that.</t4455> <t4456>Then Edward became incredibly happy, they talked for a while about what they would do, and decided that Edward should enter the church as soon as possible, and to delay the wedding until he received his ordination.</t4456> <t4457>I couldn't hear the rest, because my cousin called from downstairs, Mrs. Richardson had come with her carriage, she was going to take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I had to go into the room and interrupt them to ask Lucy if she wanted to go, but she didn't want to leave Edward, so I ran upstairs, put on my silk stockings, and went with the Richardsons.</t4457><t4458>"</t4458>
<t4459>"I didn't understand what you meant by separating them," said Elinor; "you were all together in the same room, weren't you?</t4459><t4460>"</t4460>
<t4461>"No, it's not; not all of us.</t4461> <t4462>Oh, Miss Dashwood, do you think people talk about love when someone else is around?</t4462> <t4463>No, that's inappropriate! -You can't be serious.</t4463> <t4464>(Laughing playfully.</t4464><t4465>)</t4465> <t4466>-No, no; they were locked together in the sitting room, and I listened to everything by pressing my ear to the door.</t4466><t4467>"</t4467>
<t4468>"What!" cried Elinor; "Were you only telling me things you learned by eavesdropping?</t4468> <t4469>I am sorry I did not know from the start; because I would not have accepted you relaying the details of a conversation you should not have learned.</t4469> <t4470>How could you be so unfair to your sister?</t4470><t4471>"</t4471>
<t4472>"Come on, there's nothing here.</t4472> <t4473>I just stood at the door and listened to whatever I could hear.</t4473> <t4474>I'm sure Lucy would do the same to me; because a couple of years ago, Martha Sharpe and I had many shared secrets, and she would hide in the closet or behind the fireplace screen without hesitation to listen to what we were talking about.</t4474><t4475>"</t4475>
<t4476>Elinor tried to talk about other things; but Miss Steele could not be deterred for more than a few minutes from saying the most important thing on her mind.</t4476>
<t4477>"Edward is talking about going to Oxford soon," she said, "but he is still staying at Pall Mall, No.</t4477> <t4478>-."</t4478> <t4479>What a wicked woman his mother is, isn't she?</t4479> <t4480>Your brother and sister-in-law were not very kind either!</t4480> <t4481>However, I will not say anything about them; of course, they sent us home in their own carriage, which was more than I expected.</t4481> <t4482>For my part, I was afraid your sister-in-law would ask for the sewing boxes she gave us the day before back; but anyway, they were not mentioned, so I put mine out of sight.</t4482> <t4483>Edward has some business in Oxford; he needs to go there for a while; after that, if he can arrange a bishop, he will get his license.</t4483> <t4484>I wonder what kind of church he will be given!</t4484> <t4485>-My God! (she giggled as she spoke) I know exactly what my cousins will say when they hear.</t4485> <t4486>They will tell me to write to the Doctor to get Edward the assistant priest position at his new church.</t4486> <t4487>I know they will say it; but I would never do such a thing in the world.</t4487> <t4488>'Oh dear!' I would say directly, 'how can you think of such a thing.</t4488> <t4489>I will write to the Doctor, will I!</t4489><t4490>'"</t4490>
<t4491>"Indeed," said Elinor, "being prepared for the worst case is a great comfort.</t4491> <t4492>Your answer is ready even.</t4492><t4493>"</t4493>
<t4494>Miss Steele was about to continue speaking on the same topic, but the approach of her own group made another topic more necessary.</t4494>
<t4495>"Oh dear, the Richardsons are coming.</t4495> <t4496>There are still so many things I need to tell you, but I shouldn't stay away from them for too long.</t4496> <t4497>Rest assured, they are very polite people.</t4497> <t4498>The gentleman earns an incredible amount of money; they have their own car.</t4498> <t4499>I didn't have the time to tell Mrs. Jennings personally, but please let her know that I am very happy to learn she is not angry with us, and Lady Middleton feels the same; if there is ever a situation where Mrs. Jennings needs company because you and your sister have to leave, I am sure we would be happy to come and stay with her as long as she wants.</t4499> <t4500>In my opinion, Lady Middleton doesn't want us around at the moment.</t4500> <t4501>Goodbye; I am sorry that Miss Marianne is not here.</t4501> <t4502>Please give her my regards.</t4502> <t4503>Oh dear, I wish you hadn't worn your best spotted muslin!</t4503> <t4504>-one would fear it might tear.</t4504><t4505>"</t4505>
<t4506>These were his words as he left; after that, Mrs. Richardson only had enough time to exchange a few farewell compliments with Mrs. Jennings before she called him, and Elinor was left alone with enough information to nourish her thoughts for a while, even though she had learned very little new beyond what she had already seen and planned in her own mind.</t4506> <t4507>Edward's marriage to Lucy was confirmed, and as she had guessed, the date of the event was still uncertain; - everything seemed to depend on him getting that job appointment, for which there was not the slightest chance.</t4507>
<t4508>When they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was in need of news; but Elinor, wanting to spread as little as possible of the information obtained so unjustly, limited herself to briefly repeating the simple details she believed Lucy would want known for her own interests.</t4508> <t4509>All she conveyed was that the engagement was ongoing and the decisions they had made towards reaching a conclusion; to which Mrs. Jennings had the natural reaction.</t4509>
<t4510>"Are they waiting for his appointment to the church!</t4510> <t4511>-we all know how that ends; -after waiting for a year and seeing it's useless, they settle for a curacy worth fifty pounds a year with the interest from his two thousand pounds, what good will Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt do for Lucy.</t4511> <t4512>-Then they have a child every year!</t4512> <t4513>God help them!</t4513> <t4514>How poor they will be!</t4514> <t4515>-Let me see how I can help furnish their house.</t4515> <t4516>They need two maids and two footmen! -as I said the other day.</t4516> <t4517>-No, no, they need to hire a diligent girl for all the work.</t4517> <t4518>-Betty's sister won't do for them anymore.</t4518><t4519>"</t4519>
<t4520>The next morning, Elinor received a letter from Lucy by post.</t4520> <t4521>-The letter was as follows:</t4521>
<t4522>Bartlett Buildings, March.</t4522>
<t4523>I hope dear Miss Dashwood will excuse my daring to write to her; but considering your friendship towards me and my dear Edward, I thought you would be pleased to hear our good news after all the difficulties we have faced in recent days; therefore, without further apology, I can thankfully say that although we have suffered terrible pains, we are both very well now and happy as we should always be, thanks to our love for each other.</t4523> <t4524>We have gone through great trials and great torments, but at the same time, both I and Edward, to whom I have explained everything, have seen that we have many friends, including you, whose kindness we will always remember with gratitude; therefore, I am writing with the thought that you and Mrs. Jennings would be happy to learn; yesterday afternoon we spent two happy hours with Edward; although I insisted that we part ways right there, thinking it was my duty out of common sense, he did not even want to hear the word separation, saying he would never part, that as long as he had my love, he did not care about his mother's anger, that our future was not very bright, but that we had to wait and hope for the best; he will soon receive his ordination certificate, and if you have the opportunity to recommend him to someone who has a church to offer, I am sure you will not forget us; I am sure Mrs. Jennings will also say good things about us to Sir John or Mr. Palmer or any friend who can help us - Poor Anne feels very guilty for what she did, but she did it with good intentions, so I say nothing; I hope Mrs. Jennings will not hesitate to visit us if she happens to be in this area in the mornings; she would be showing great kindness, and my cousins would be honored to meet her - As I come to the end of the paper, I respectfully and gratefully ask you to convey my regards to Sir John, Lady Middleton, and the dear children when you have the chance to see them, and my love to Miss Marianne.</t4524>
<t4525>Regards etc.</t4525> <t4526>etc.</t4526>
<t4527>As soon as Elinor finished reading, she did what she believed to be the author's true intention and placed the letter in Mrs. Jennings's hands; Mrs. Jennings read the letter aloud with comments full of satisfaction and praise.</t4527>
<t4528>"Very good indeed!</t4528> <t4529>-how beautifully she writes!</t4529> <t4530>-it's good that she wants to set the young man free.</t4530> <t4531>It suits Lucy.</t4531> <t4532>-Poor thing!</t4532> <t4533>I wish I could find a place for the young man, how much I would like that.</t4533> <t4534>-She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings, do you see.</t4534> <t4535>Such a kind-hearted girl.</t4535> <t4536>-Very good indeed.</t4536> <t4537>This sentence is very well constructed.</t4537> <t4538>Of course, of course, I will go and see her.</t4538> <t4539>How considerate the little one is, she thought of everyone!</t4539> <t4540>-Thank you, dear, for showing me the letter.</t4540> <t4541>One of the most beautiful letters I've ever seen; it makes one admire both Lucy's mind and heart.</t4541><t4542>"</t4542>
<t4543>It had been more than two months since the Miss Dashwoods had arrived in the city, and Marianne's impatience to return was growing every day.</t4543> <t4544>She missed the village air, the freedom, the tranquility; if there was a place that could give her peace, she thought it must be Barton.</t4544> <t4545>Elinor wanted to go back just as much as she did, but she was not very keen on leaving immediately, because she knew the difficulties of such a long journey and that Marianne would not want to accept these difficulties.</t4545> <t4546>Nevertheless, she seriously started planning their return; when she told her kind hosts about her thoughts, Mrs. Jennings objected with all the sweetness of her good intentions; when she proposed a plan that would keep them away from their home for a few more weeks, this seemed much more reasonable to Elinor than other possibilities.</t4546> <t4547>The Palmers were going to Cleveland for the Easter holidays at the end of March; Mrs. Jennings received a warm invitation from Charlotte to accompany them with both friends.</t4547> <t4548>This invitation would not have appealed to Miss Dashwood; -but Mr. Palmer insisted with such genuine politeness that, combined with his behavior, which had shown a great change since learning of his sister-in-law's unhappiness, he managed to get her to gladly accept the invitation.</t4548>
<t4549>When she told Marianne about what had happened, however, Marianne's initial response was not very joyful.</t4549>
<t4550>"Cleveland!" he shouted, angrily.</t4550> <t4551>"No, I can't go to Cleveland."</t4551>
<t4552>"That place," said Elinor gently, "you know it's not around... the thing."</t4552><t4553>"</t4553>
<t4554>"But in Somersetshire."</t4554> <t4555>"-I can't go to Somersetshire."</t4555> <t4556>"-That place, in my dreams..."</t4556> <t4557>"No Elinor, you can't expect me to go there."</t4557><t4558>"</t4558>
<t4559>Elinor would not argue that she needed to overcome these feelings; -she only tried to counter them by putting forward other considerations; she argued that the invitation was an opportunity that provided a clear date for returning to their dearly missed mother in a more organized, comfortable, and perhaps less delayed manner compared to other plans.</t4559> <t4560>The distance from Cleveland, a few miles away from Bristol, to Barton would not take more than a day; their mother's servant could come there to accompany them; since it was not possible for them to stay at Cleveland for more than a week, they could be home in a little over three weeks.</t4560> <t4561>Since Marianne's longing for her mother was genuine, these words easily overcame the imaginary misfortune she had just proposed.</t4561>
<t4562>Mrs. Jennings was far from being tired of her guests, so much so that she insisted quite a bit for them to return with her from Cleveland.</t4562> <t4563>Elinor was grateful for the interest shown, but this interest could not change their plans; everything related to their return was arranged as much as possible, especially since their mother's consent was already obtained; -Marianne tried to console herself by counting the hours that would keep her away from Barton.</t4563>
<t4564>"Ah Colonel, what will you and I do without the Miss Dashwoods;" said Mrs. Jennings, when the Colonel first visited her after their departure was decided "They are quite determined to go home from the Palmers'; -how sad we will be when I return!</t4564> <t4565>-My God! We will sit and look at each other gloomily like two cats.</t4565><t4566>"</t4566>
<t4567>Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was provoking her by harshly depicting her future troubles, thereby offering her a chance to escape from this distress; -if so, she soon had good reason to think she had achieved her goal; because when Elinor went to the window to more quickly get the dimensions of a picture she was going to copy for her friend, she followed her with a meaningful look and spoke with her there for a few minutes.</t4567> <t4568>The effect of her conversation on the young lady did not escape her notice; although she was too noble to eavesdrop, and even got up and moved to the seat next to the piano where Marianne was playing to avoid hearing, she couldn't help but notice that Elinor's face changed color, she became excited, and listened to what was being said with such great attention that she couldn't continue her work.</t4568> <t4569>What further confirmed her hopes were some words that inevitably reached the Colonel's ears during a break Marianne took between lessons: she was apologizing for the poor condition of her house.</t4569> <t4570>This made the matter indisputable.</t4570> <t4571>She was really surprised that the Colonel found it necessary to do so; -but she thought that this must be the custom.</t4571> <t4572>She couldn't hear what Elinor replied, but from the movement of her lips, she guessed that there was no significant objection; -and Mrs. Jennings, being so honest, congratulated Elinor inwardly.</t4572> <t4573>Then they spoke for a few more minutes about something she couldn't catch a single word of, then another fortunate pause in Marianne's music brought the Colonel's calm voice to her ears with these words,</t4573>
<t4574>"I'm afraid it can't be very soon.</t4574><t4575>"</t4575>
<t4576>She was surprised and upset by such an unromantic remark and was just about to shout out loud, "My God!</t4576> <t4577>What could possibly be the obstacle!" but she restrained herself and limited her reaction to these silent words,</t4577>
<t4578>"Very strange! -how much longer does he expect to age."</t4578><t4579>"-</t4579>
<t4580>However, the Colonel's delay did not seem to have offended or upset his lovely friend at all, because shortly after they finished their conversation and parted ways, Mrs. Jennings clearly heard Elinor say in a sincere voice,</t4580>
<t4581>"I will always feel grateful to you."</t4581><t4582>"</t4582>
<t4583>Mrs. Jennings was pleased with Elinor's gratitude and couldn't help but be surprised that after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel could calmly ask for permission to leave immediately without giving Elinor any response!</t4583> <t4584>-It never occurred to her that her old friend could be such an indifferent lover.</t4584>
<t4585>What actually happened between the two was this.</t4585>
<t4586>"To your friend Mr. Ferrars," said the Colonel, with a great sense of pity, "I heard about the great injustice his family did to him; if I understand the matter correctly, his family completely disowned him because he insisted on keeping his promise to a very reasonable young lady."</t4586> <t4587>-Did I hear correctly?</t4587> <t4588>-Is that so?</t4588><t4589>"-</t4589>
<t4590>Elinor said so.</t4590>
<t4591>"Two young people who have been connected for a long time," said the Colonel, emotionally, "the cruelty, the blind cruelty of separating them or attempting to separate them is a terrible thing - Mrs. Ferrars doesn't know what she's doing - what she might be pushing her son into.</t4591> <t4592>I have seen Mr. Edward Ferrars in Harley Street two or three times and I liked him very much.</t4592> <t4593>He is not a young man with whom one can easily form a close relationship, but I got to know him well enough to wish him well; especially as your friend, I wish him even more.</t4593> <t4594>I know that he intends to enter the church.</t4594> <t4595>Could you kindly tell him that the church at Delaford, which has recently become vacant, as I learned from a letter that arrived today, is his, if he deems it worthy of acceptance; - but perhaps, given his current difficult situation, it might seem absurd to doubt this; I wish it were more valuable.</t4595> <t4596>- It is a small church; I believe the late clergyman received no more than two hundred pounds a year; although it could possibly be increased, I fear it won't provide him with a very comfortable income.</t4596> <t4597>Nevertheless, it is a great pleasure for me to offer it to him.</t4597> <t4598>Please make sure he is certain of this.</t4598><t4599>"</t4599>
<t4600>If the Colonel had proposed to her, Elinor's astonishment could not have been greater than what she felt in the face of this task.</t4600> <t4601>Just two days ago, the job opportunity she thought was hopeless for Edward was now being offered to him so that he could marry - and out of all the people in the world, she was the one chosen to bestow it!</t4601> <t4602>-She was so excited that Mrs. Jennings attributed her state to a very different reason; -but whatever lesser, less pleasant feelings might have shared in that excitement, her respect for the general benevolence that drove Colonel Brandon to this action and her gratitude for this particular friendship were strongly felt and warmly expressed.</t4602> <t4603>She thanked him with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and temperament with the praise she knew they deserved; she said that if he truly wanted to give such a good duty to someone else, she would gladly fulfill it.</t4603> <t4604>But on the other hand, she couldn't help but think that no one else could perform that duty as well as the Colonel.</t4604> <t4605>In short, because she did not want to cause Edward the pain of accepting a favor from him, she would be very happy to be excused from this duty; but for equally kind reasons, Colonel Brandon, who had declined it, still seemed to want the offer to be made through her so much that Elinor could no longer object for any reason.</t4605> <t4606>She thought Edward was still in town and fortunately had heard his address from Miss Steele.</t4606> <t4607>Thus, she could manage to inform him within the day.</t4607> <t4608>After this decision was made, Colonel Brandon began to talk about how lucky he was to have such a respectable and good neighbor, then added, with regret, that the house was small and ordinary - Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had guessed, did not care about this negativity, at least in terms of the house's dimensions.</t4608>
<t4609>"I don't think the small size of the house," said Elinor, "will be a problem for them, because it will be proportional to their family and income.</t4609><t4610>"</t4610>
<t4611>Upon this, the Colonel saw with astonishment that Elinor considered their marriage proposal as a definitive outcome; because he did not think that the church in Delaford could bring in enough income for people with that lifestyle to make a living - and he said so.</t4611>
<t4612>"This small vicarage can do no more than ensure Mr. Ferrars' comfort as a bachelor; it cannot allow him to marry.</t4612> <t4613>I regret to say that my patronage ends here.</t4613> <t4614>Still, if an unforeseen opportunity arises and I can help him more, I will consider him differently than I do now, and I will be ready to be as helpful to him then as I sincerely wish to be now.</t4614> <t4615>What I am doing now is really nothing, because it can advance him very little towards the main, sole object of happiness.</t4615> <t4616>Marriage remains a distant plan; -at least, I fear it cannot happen so soon.</t4616><t4617>"-</t4617>
<t4618>It was that sentence, when misunderstood, that justifiably hurt Mrs. Jennings' sensitive feelings; but after the story of what transpired between Colonel Brandon and Elinor while they stood by the window, it might be evident to everyone that the gratitude Elinor expressed as they parted was not articulated with a more inappropriate excitement or less elegant words than what could be said in response to a marriage proposal.</t4618>
<t4619>"Alright, Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Jennings, smiling knowingly as soon as the gentleman left, "I won't ask you what the Colonel said; because although I really tried not to listen, I couldn't prevent enough of it from reaching my ears to understand his trouble.</t4619> <t4620>I assure you, I have never been this happy in my life; I wish you happiness with all my heart.</t4620><t4621>"</t4621>
<t4622>"Thank you, sir," said Elinor.</t4622> <t4623>"An event that made me very happy; I deeply felt Colonel Brandon's kindness.</t4623> <t4624>There are not many people who would do what he did.</t4624> <t4625>Very few have such a compassionate heart!</t4625> <t4626>I have never been so surprised in my life.</t4626><t4627>"</t4627>
<t4628>"My God! You are so humble!"</t4628> <t4629>"I wasn't surprised at all because I have been thinking about it often lately, and there was nothing more likely to happen than this."</t4629><t4630>"</t4630>
<t4631>"You thought so because you knew the Colonel's general benevolence; but at least you could not have guessed that this opportunity could come up so quickly.</t4631><t4632>"</t4632>
<t4633>"Opportunity!" repeated Mrs. Jennings. "Ha! But once a man decides on something like this, he will find the opportunity one way or another.</t4633> <t4634>Well, my dear, I wish you happiness again and again; if there is a happy couple in the world, I now know where to look for them soon.</t4634><t4635>"</t4635>
<t4636>"I suppose you mean to go to Delaford after them," said Elinor with a faint smile.</t4636>
<t4637>"Of course, darling, of course.</t4637> <t4638>I don't know what the Colonel meant by saying the house is bad; I think it's one of the neatest houses I've ever seen.</t4638><t4639>"</t4639>
<t4640>"He mentioned that he wanted a repair."</t4640><t4641>"</t4641>
<t4642>"Then whose fault is it?</t4642> <t4643>Let them fix it!</t4643> <t4644>-who else will do it?</t4644><t4645>"</t4645>
<t4646>Their conversation ended when the servant came in to announce that the carriage was at the door; Mrs. Jennings immediately prepared to leave and said-</t4646>
<t4647>"Anyway, I couldn't even say half of what I wanted to, but I have to go.</t4647> <t4648>However, we can talk about everything tonight, because we will be alone.</t4648> <t4649>I don't want you to come with me, besides, your mind is probably too occupied with matters to think about going out; and you must be eager to tell your sister as well.</t4649><t4650>"</t4650>
<t4651>Marianne had left the room before the conversation started.</t4651>
<t4652>"Of course, sir, I will tell Marianne; but for now, I will not mention it to anyone else.</t4652><t4653>"</t4653>
<t4654>"Well, alright," said Mrs. Jennings, somewhat surprised.</t4654> <t4655>"Then you don't want me to tell Lucy, because I was saying I would go as far as Holborn today.</t4655><t4656>"</t4656>
<t4657>"No sir, do not tell Lucy, if possible.</t4657> <t4658>A delay of one day will not be very important; I think no one else should be told until I write to Mr. Ferrars.</t4658> <t4659>I will do this directly myself.</t4659> <t4660>It is important not to waste time regarding him, because there will be a lot to deal with concerning his appointment.</t4660><t4661>"</t4661>
<t4662>These words first surprised Mrs. Jennings greatly.</t4662> <t4663>She couldn't immediately grasp why Mr. Ferrars should be written to about this matter in such haste.</t4663> <t4664>After thinking for a few seconds, a very good idea came to her mind and she excitedly said:-</t4664>
<t4665>"Ahha! -I understand you.</t4665> <t4666>Mr. Ferrars will be the best man.</t4666> <t4667>Good, it suits him.</t4667> <t4668>I wish he would get his certificate immediately; I am pleased that things are moving so quickly between you.</t4668> <t4669>But darling, isn't this a bit characterless?</t4669> <t4670>Wouldn't it be better if the Colonel wrote it himself? -he is definitely the right person.</t4670><t4671>"</t4671>
<t4672>Elinor did not fully understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings' speech; she did not think it worth inquiring into; so she responded to the latter part of the conversation.</t4672>
<t4673>"Colonel Brandon is such a kind man that he wanted anyone but himself to tell Mr. Ferrars his thoughts."</t4673><t4674>"</t4674>
<t4675>"You had to say it too.</t4675> <t4676>Well, what a strange courtesy! Anyway, let me not bother you (seeing that you are preparing to write a letter).</t4676> <t4677>You know best what to do.</t4677> <t4678>Goodbye, my dear.</t4678> <t4679>Since Charlotte was given to me, I haven't heard anything that made me this happy.</t4679><t4680>"</t4680>
<t4681>She left; but then she immediately returned,</t4681>
<t4682>"I was thinking about Betty's sister, darling.</t4682> <t4683>Finding her a good lady would make me happy.</t4683> <t4684>But I'm not sure if she can be a lady's personal maid.</t4684> <t4685>She is very good at housework and also knows sewing and embroidery.</t4685> <t4686>However, you can think about these things in your spare time.</t4686><t4687>"</t4687>
<t4688>"Of course, sir," Elinor replied, without hearing most of what was said; she wanted to be alone more than to be the lady in question.</t4688>
<t4689>How should she begin, how should she express herself in the letter she was going to write to Edward - this was her whole concern now.</t4689> <t4690>The special situation between them made an action that would seem the easiest thing in the world to others difficult, but she was equally afraid of saying too much or too little; she sat down at the paper and thought, pen in hand, until Edward's arrival stopped her.</t4690>
<t4691>As Edward was coming to leave his calling card, he encountered Mrs. Jennings at the door, who was on her way to her car; Mrs. Jennings apologized for not being able to return herself, insisted that Miss Dashwood was upstairs, and urged him to go in, saying that she wanted to discuss a very important matter with him.</t4691>
<t4692>Elinor, in all her indecision, was just consoling herself with the thought that although it was difficult to express herself in a letter, it was at least better than delivering the news face-to-face, when the guest entered, forcing her into this greatest of all efforts.</t4692><t4693>Her astonishment and shock at his sudden appearance were immense.</t4693><t4694>Since the engagement had been announced, and thus since Edward knew she had learned of it, she had not seen him; this made her quite uneasy for a few minutes because she knew what he might be thinking and what she had to say to him.</t4694><t4695>Edward was also very uncomfortable; they sat in an expectant discomfort.</t4695><t4696>Edward could not remember if he had apologized for disturbing her when he first entered the room; but to be sure, as soon as he was able to speak after sitting down on a chair, he duly apologized.</t4696>
<t4697>"Mrs. Jennings said you wanted to speak with me," he said, "or at least that's what I understood - otherwise, I wouldn't want to bother you in this way; although, of course, it would have greatly saddened me to leave London without seeing you and your sister; moreover, it seems unlikely that I will have the pleasure of seeing you again soon.</t4697> <t4698>I am going to Oxford tomorrow.</t4698><t4699>"</t4699>
<t4700>"Nevertheless," said Elinor, pulling herself together, determined to address the matter that frightened her as soon as possible, "you wouldn't leave without our best wishes, even if we couldn't meet face to face.</t4700> <t4701>What Mrs. Jennings said is true.</t4701> <t4702>There is something important I need to tell you, I was just about to write you a letter.</t4702> <t4703>I have been given a very pleasant duty, (she was breathing a little faster than usual as she spoke.</t4703><t4704>)</t4704> <t4705>Colonel Brandon was here just ten minutes ago, and knowing that you intend to enter the church, he asked me to tell you that he is very happy to offer you the recently vacated church in Delaford, though he wishes it were more valuable.</t4705> <t4706>Allow me to congratulate you on having such a respectable and understanding friend and to join in his wish; indeed, I wish the church—which brings in around two hundred annually—were much larger and could provide you with more opportunities, more than just a temporary lodging for yourself, so that you could realize all your thoughts of happiness.</t4706><t4707>"</t4707>
<t4708>No one can be expected to say what Edward is feeling on his behalf, because he himself cannot say it.</t4708> <t4709>He looked with all the astonishment that such an unexpected, such an unthought-of piece of news could naturally cause; but he only said these two words,</t4709>
<t4710>"Colonel Brandon!"-</t4710>
<t4711>"Yes," continued Elinor, with more determination, having overcome the worst part; "Colonel Brandon considers this as a proof of the interest he feels due to recent events - the cruel situation your family's unjust behavior has put you in. I am sure Marianne, I, and all your friends share this interest; likewise, it is a sign of his great respect for your character and his approval of your conduct in that situation.</t4711><t4712>"</t4712>
<t4713>"Colonel Brandon is giving me a church!"</t4713> <t4714>"-Is that possible?"</t4714><t4715>"</t4715>
<t4716>"You are surprised to find friendship elsewhere because of the cruelty of your own relatives.</t4716><t4717>"</t4717>
<t4718>"No," replied Edward, suddenly coming to his senses, "it's not about finding friendship in you; because it is impossible for me not to know that I owe all of it to you, to your kindness.</t4718> <t4719>-I feel this -if I could, I would express it -but as you know, I am not a good speaker.</t4719><t4720>"</t4720>
<t4721>"You are very mistaken.</t4721> <t4722>I assure you, you owe this entirely to your own merits and to Colonel Brandon's appreciation of those merits.</t4722> <t4723>I had no influence at all.</t4723> <t4724>Until I learned of his decision, I didn't even know the church was vacant; I didn't even know there was such a church among his possibilities.</t4724> <t4725>As a friend of my family, he may have taken even greater pleasure in giving it to you - in fact, I knew he did; - but believe me, you owe nothing to my intervention.</t4725><t4726>"</t4726>
<t4727>The truth forced her to admit that she had a small part in his actions, but at the same time she was so reluctant to appear as Edward's patron that she accepted it hesitantly; thus, she probably dispelled the doubt that had come to Edward's mind.</t4727> <t4728>After Elinor fell silent, Edward sat thoughtfully for a short while; -finally, and as if with difficulty, he said,</t4728>
<t4729>"Colonel Brandon seems to be a valuable and respectable person.</t4729> <t4730>I have always heard him spoken of in this way; your brother also holds him in high regard.</t4730> <t4731>Undoubtedly a decent man; his manners are those of a true gentleman.</t4731><t4732>"</t4732>
<t4733>"Once you get to know him better," Elinor replied, "I believe you will see that everything you've heard about him is true; and since you will be close neighbors (because from what I understand, the parsonage is very close to the manor), it is particularly important that he possesses all these qualities.</t4733><t4734>"</t4734>
<t4735>Edward did not respond; but when Elinor turned her head, he gave her such a serious, such an emotional, such a sorrowful look that it was as if he were saying he wished the distance between the lodge and the mansion were much greater.</t4735>
<t4736>"Colonel Brandon, I believe, stays on St James Street," he said, immediately after, rising from his chair.</t4736>
<t4737>Elinor said the house number.</t4737>
<t4738>"Then let me hurry and express to him the gratitude you did not allow me to express to you; let me convey that he made me very - extremely happy."</t4738><t4739>"</t4739>
<t4740>Elinor did not try to hold her back; they parted; Elinor expressed her endless good wishes for every change of situation she might experience; she tried to reciprocate with the same good wishes, even though she did not have the strength to articulate them.</t4740>
<t4741>"The next time I see him," Elinor said to herself, as the door closed behind him, "I will see him as Lucy's husband.</t4741><t4742>"</t4742>
<t4743>And she sat in this pleasant anticipation, thought about the past, remembered Edward's conversations, tried to grasp all her emotions, and of course, began to reflect on her own unhappiness.</t4743>
<t4744>When Mrs. Jennings returned home, even though she was coming back from seeing people she had never seen before and thus had a lot to tell about them, her mind was so full of an important secret entrusted to her that as soon as Elinor appeared, she immediately turned back there again.</t4744>
<t4745>"Alright, sweetheart," he shouted, "I sent the young man to you.</t4745> <t4746>Didn't I do the right thing?</t4746> <t4747>-You didn't have any trouble, did you? -He wasn't reluctant to accept your offer, was he?</t4747><t4748>"</t4748>
<t4749>"No, sir; this was not very possible."</t4749><t4750>"</t4750>
<t4751>"So, when will it be ready?</t4751> <t4752>-Because everything seems to depend on this.</t4752><t4753>"</t4753>
<t4754>"Actually," said Elinor, "I don't know these kinds of procedures at all, so I can't even guess the time or necessary preparations; but I think the appointment will take place within two or three months.</t4754><t4755>"</t4755>
<t4756>"Two or three months!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "My God! How can you speak so calmly; can the Colonel wait two or three months!</t4756> <t4757>What has happened to me!</t4757> <t4758>-Even I don't have the patience for this!</t4758> <t4759>-Of course, one feels pleased with Mr. Ferrars' courtesy, but I mean, I don't think it's worth waiting two or three months for him.</t4759> <t4760>Someone else who can do the same job can be found; someone already in the church.</t4760><t4761>"</t4761>
<t4762>"Dear madam," said Elinor, "what do you think? -because Colonel Brandon's sole purpose is to be of help to Mr. Ferrars.</t4762><t4763>"</t4763>
<t4764>"Well then! -now you're telling me that the Colonel only married you to make a few bucks for Mr. Ferrars!"</t4764><t4765>"</t4765>
<t4766>The game could not continue any longer; an explanation came immediately and amused both of them quite a bit at once, without spoiling anyone's mood too much, because Mrs. Jennings quickly shifted from one form of cheerfulness to another, and moreover, she did not give up on her initial expectation.</t4766>
<t4767>"Yes, yes, the lodge is small," he said, after the first wave of shock and excitement had passed, "it is even very likely to be in a dilapidated state; but when you think about a man apologizing for a house with five sitting rooms on the ground floor, and according to what I heard from the steward, even with fifteen bedrooms!</t4767> <t4768>And you too, you who used to live in Barton cottage!</t4768> <t4769>-It sounded funny, that is.</t4769> <t4770>But my dear, let's hint to the Colonel to do something about the lodge, make it more comfortable before Lucy leaves.</t4770><t4771>"</t4771>
<t4772>"But Colonel Brandon doesn't seem to think the church is big enough to accommodate their wedding.</t4772><t4773>"</t4773>
<t4774>"The Colonel is a grumbler, darling; since he has two thousand a year, he thinks no one can marry on less.</t4774> <t4775>Mark my words, if I live long enough, I will go to Delaford Church before Michaelmas, and I will go because Lucy is there.</t4775><t4776>"</t4776>
<t4777>Elinor completely agreed with her that they would no longer wait for anything.</t4777>
<t4778>After conveying his thanks to Colonel Brandon, Edward went to Lucy with joy; by the time he reached Bartlett Buildings, his joy had become so extreme that Lucy could tell Mrs. Jennings, who visited again the next day to congratulate him, that she had never seen Edward so happy in his life.</t4778>
<t4779>Her own happiness, her own joy was just as certain; she wholeheartedly shared Mrs. Jennings' feelings that they would all be happy together in the Delaford Church parsonage before Michaelmas.</t4779> <t4780>Moreover, she was so far from being reluctant to give Edward his due that she spoke with a grateful warmth about the friendship Elinor had shown them both, ready to acknowledge how much they owed her, even openly stating that no effort Miss Dashwood had made for their well-being now or in the past would surprise her, because she believed Elinor was someone who would do anything in the world for the people she truly cared about.</t4780> <t4781>As for Colonel Brandon, she not only worshipped him as a saint but also believed that he should be treated like a saint in all worldly matters; she even thought the taxes he paid to the church should be raised to the highest bracket; and secretly, she was planning to make the most of his servants, carriage, cows, and chickens at Delaford.</t4781>
<t4782>It had been more than a week since John Dashwood had visited Berkeley Street; since they had received no information about his wife's illness other than a verbal attempt, Elinor began to see it necessary to visit him.</t4782> <t4783>-However, this was not only because she felt like it, but also because none of her friends supported the idea.</t4783> <t4784>Marianne not only refrained from going herself but also tried to prevent her sister from going; although her carriage was always at Elinor's disposal, Mrs. Jennings was so annoyed with Mrs. John Dashwood that neither her curiosity to see how she looked after the latest discovery nor her desire to annoy her by taking Edward's side could overcome her reluctance to be in her company again.</t4784> <t4785>In the end, Elinor decided to make the visit on her own; no one could be more reluctant than she was to make this visit and risk a tête-à-tête with a woman whom the other two justifiably disliked.</t4785>
<t4786>Mrs. Dashwood said goodbye; but before the carriage left the house, her husband accidentally went outside.</t4786> <t4787>He said he was very happy to have met Elinor; she was already planning to visit Berkeley Street; saying that Fanny would be very happy to see her, he invited her inside.</t4787>
<t4788>They went upstairs to the living room.</t4788> <t4789>"There was no one there. 'Fanny must be in her own room,' she said; 'I'll go to her right away, because I'm sure she would never object to seeing you.'</t4789> <t4790>'Of course, it has nothing to do with it.'</t4790> <t4791>Especially not now - but nevertheless, you and Marianne have always been her favorites.</t4791> <t4792>'Why didn't Marianne come?'</t4792><t4793>"-</t4793>
<t4794>Elinor made an excuse on his behalf.</t4794>
<t4795>"I was not upset to see you alone," he replied, "because I have a lot to tell you.</t4795> <t4796>Colonel Brandon's church - could it be true? - did he really give it to Edward?</t4796> <t4797>I learned it by chance yesterday and was coming to ask you about it.</t4797><t4798>"</t4798>
<t4799>"Absolutely true.</t4799> <t4800>-Colonel Brandon gave Delaford Church to Edward.</t4800><t4801>"</t4801>
<t4802>"Really!</t4802> <t4803>-Very surprising indeed!</t4803> <t4804>-What does it have to do with anything! -There's no kinship between them!</t4804> <t4805>-Even churches are bringing in quite a bit of money now!</t4805> <t4806>-What is its value?</t4806><t4807>"</t4807>
<t4808>"About two hundred a year.</t4808><t4809>"</t4809>
<t4810>"It seems good - for the second sale of a church of that value - considering that the old priest is elderly and sick and will vacate the place soon - he must have received fourteen hundred pounds.</t4810> <t4811>Then how did he manage to settle the matter before this person's death?</t4811> <t4812>-Now, of course, it's too late to sell the place, especially for a man as smart as Colonel Brandon!</t4812> <t4813>I am surprised that he could be so imprudent about such an ordinary, such a natural matter!</t4813> <t4814>-Well, I think almost every human character has a great inconsistency.</t4814> <t4815>But I guess - it occurred to me that maybe the event is like this.</t4815> <t4816>Edward will have the church until the person to whom Colonel Brandon actually sold it comes of age.</t4816> <t4817>-Yes yes, that's it, definitely.</t4817><t4818>"</t4818>
<t4819>Elinor objected to this quite positively; stating that she had been given the task of conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward, and thus knew the conditions under which the church was to be given, she forced him to submit to her authority.</t4819>
<t4820>"Truly astonishing!" -exclaimed John Dashwood upon hearing what was said -"What reason could the Colonel have?</t4820><t4821>"</t4821>
<t4822>"A very simple reason - to be of help to Mr. Ferrars.</t4822><t4823>"</t4823>
<t4824>"Alright, alright; no matter what kind of person Colonel Brandon is, Edward is a very lucky man! -Don't tell Fanny about the matter, though I did hint at it, and she took it quite calmly, -but you wouldn't have liked to hear it being mentioned too much"</t4824>
<t4825>Elinor felt like saying that Fanny would certainly show fortitude because her brother had acquired a fortune that would not lead to her or her child's impoverishment, but she restrained herself with difficulty.</t4825>
<t4826>"Mrs Ferrars," John Dashwood added, lowering his voice as if moving on to an important matter, "does not know about these yet; I think it is best to hide it from her as much as possible.</t4826> <t4827>-When the marriage takes place, I fear she will have to learn everything anyway.</t4827><t4828>"</t4828>
<t4829>"But why be so cautious?</t4829> <t4830>-Knowing that her son earns enough money to live on might not please her in the slightest, -this is obviously out of the question; -but why should she feel anything after his last action?</t4830> <t4831>-she rejected her son, cast him away forever, and forced the people she had influence over to do the same.</t4831> <t4832>After doing all this, it is certainly not expected for her to feel sorrow or joy on his behalf -nothing that happens to him can concern her.</t4832> <t4833>After destroying all of a child's opportunities, one cannot still be weak enough to carry a mother's worries!</t4833><t4834>"</t4834>
<t4835>"Ah Elinor," said John, "your way of reasoning is quite good, but it is based on a great ignorance of human nature.</t4835> <t4836>When Edward's unhappy marriage takes place, I am sure his mother will feel as if she has not disowned him; therefore, everything that could hasten that regrettable event must be kept from her as much as possible.</t4836> <t4837>Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son.</t4837><t4838>"</t4838>
<t4839>"You surprise me; I thought it would have been erased from memory by now."</t4839><t4840>"</t4840>
<t4841>"You are completely misjudging her.</t4841> <t4842>-Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most loving mothers in the world.</t4842><t4843>"</t4843>
<t4844>Elinor was silent.</t4844>
<t4845>"We are now," said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, "considering Robert's marriage to Miss Morton.</t4845><t4846>"</t4846>
<t4847>Elinor, who smiled at the serious and definite sense of importance in her brother's tone of voice, calmly replied,</t4847>
<t4848>"I guess the lady doesn't have a choice in this matter."</t4848><t4849>"</t4849>
<t4850>"To choose! -what do you mean?"</t4850><t4851>"-</t4851>
<t4852>"I just want to say, from what I understand from your way of speaking, it doesn't matter to Miss Morton whether she marries Edward or Robert."</t4852><t4853>"</t4853>
<t4854>"Definitely, what difference will it make; Robert is now considered the eldest son in every respect; -in other aspects, they are both very nice young men, in my opinion, neither is superior to the other."</t4854><t4855>"</t4855>
<t4856>Elinor didn't say anything else; John also remained silent for a short while.</t4856> <t4857>-His observations ended like this.</t4857>
<t4858>"On one matter, my dear sister," he said, taking her hand and speaking in a tremendous whisper, "I can assure you; -and I will, because I know it will give you pride.</t4858> <t4859>-I have good reasons to think so -I even heard it from the most authoritative source, otherwise, I wouldn't repeat it, because it would be very wrong to say anything about it otherwise -no, I didn't hear Mrs. Ferrars herself say it -but her daughter said it and I heard it from her -That is, against a certain thing -against a certain union -you understand me -whatever objections there might be, it would be much more preferred, it wouldn't cause half the distress that this matter has caused.</t4859> <t4860>I was extremely pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars evaluated the matter in this light -it is a situation that makes us all proud.</t4860> <t4861>'It is incomparable,' she said, 'the lesser of two evils; she would now willingly accept it to avoid something worse.</t4861><t4862>'</t4862> <t4863>But nevertheless, these are not the issue -what is thought and said -to unite, that is -it couldn't be -it's over and done with.</t4863> <t4864>But I thought I'd tell you this, because I know how much it will please you.</t4864> <t4865>There is no reason for you to feel regret, dear Elinor.</t4865> <t4866>Surely you will make a very good marriage -so good, even better, perhaps, when looked at thoroughly.</t4866> <t4867>Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?</t4867><t4868>"</t4868>
<t4869>Elinor had heard enough, not enough to flatter her pride or increase her sense of importance, but enough to irritate her nerves and occupy her mind; -so she was glad to be relieved from the necessity of giving a proper response by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars, and from the danger of hearing more from his brother.</t4869> <t4870>After chatting for a few minutes, John Dashwood remembered that he was unaware of his sister-in-law Fanny's presence there and left the room to look for her, leaving Elinor to further her acquaintance with Robert; with his cheerful indifference and happy ease in his manners, Robert continued to confirm Elinor's most negative opinions about his mind and soul, while enjoying an undeserved share of his mother's affection and generosity, the cost of which was borne by his exiled brother, and only thanks to his own profligate lifestyle.</t4870>
<t4871>It had only been two minutes since they were alone when Robert started talking about Edward; he had also heard about the church and was very curious about the subject.</t4871> <t4872>Elinor repeated to him the details as she had told John; although the effect on Robert was different, it was no less remarkable than it had been on John.</t4872> <t4873>He immediately laughed.</t4873> <t4874>The idea of Edward being a clergyman and living in a small parsonage amused him greatly; -adding the image of Edward preaching in a white robe and announcing the marriage banns between John Smith and Mary Brown, nothing in the world could be funnier.</t4874>
<t4875>Elinor could not prevent her gaze from fixing on him with all the contempt her eyes could convey, as she waited in silence and with a grave seriousness for this foolishness to end.</t4875> <t4876>Nevertheless, it was a very purposeful look, because it both relieved her own feelings and did not give him any material.</t4876> <t4877>Robert shifted from joking to seriousness, not because of Elinor's reproachful looks, but due to his own excitement.</t4877>
<t4878>"Just kidding," she finally said, recovering from her fake laughter that extended the unique joy of the moment considerably -"but it really is a very serious matter.</t4878> <t4879>Poor Edward! His life is ruined.</t4879> <t4880>I am exceedingly sorry -because I know he is a very good-natured person; he is an extremely well-intentioned man.</t4880> <t4881>Do not judge him based on your brief acquaintance, Miss Dashwood.</t4881> <t4882>-Poor Edward! -In terms of behavior, he is not the happiest person in the world -But you know, we are not all born with the same talents -the same virtues.</t4882> <t4883>-Poor thing! -seeing him among strangers! -he really seemed pitiable!</t4883> <t4884>-but I truly believe he is the kindest-hearted person in the kingdom; I am telling you frankly, I have never been as surprised as when these things came to light.</t4884> <t4885>-I couldn't believe it.</t4885> <t4886>-My mother was the first to tell me, and I felt compelled to act decisively and immediately said to her, 'Dear madam, I don't know what you intend to do in this situation, but as for me, I must state that if Edward marries this young woman, I will never look at his face again in my life.</t4886><t4887>'</t4887> <t4888>That's exactly what I said at that moment, -I was truly exceedingly surprised!</t4888> <t4889>-Poor Edward! -he has ruined himself forever!</t4889> <t4890>-he has deprived himself of all decent people!</t4890> <t4891>-but as I told my mother directly, it was not a surprise to me at all; it was expected from his style of upbringing.</t4891> <t4892>Poor mother almost lost herself.</t4892><t4893>"</t4893>
<t4894>"Did you see the lady?"</t4894><t4895>"</t4895>
<t4896>"Yes, once, while staying in this house, I dropped by for ten minutes; I saw enough.</t4896> <t4897>The most ordinary, disastrous country girl, no style, no elegance, no proper beauty.</t4897> <t4898>-I remember her very well.</t4898> <t4899>The kind of girl I would say could definitely snag poor Edward.</t4899> <t4900>As soon as my mother told me about the matter, I immediately offered to talk to Edward myself and try to dissuade him from marriage; but I learned that it was already too late to do anything, because unfortunately I wasn't around at first and by the time I found out about the matter, they had already broken up, so it wasn't my place to interfere then.</t4900> <t4901>But if I had known a few hours earlier - probably something could have been done.</t4901> <t4902>I would have explained the situation to Edward very clearly.</t4902> <t4903>'Look, my friend,' I would say, 'think carefully about what you're doing.</t4903> <t4904>You are making a very disgraceful marriage and your family is unanimously against it.'</t4904> <t4905>So I can't help but think a way would have been found.</t4905> <t4906>But now it's too late.</t4906> <t4907>Doomed to starvation; -that's clear; definitely doomed to starvation.</t4907><t4908>"</t4908>
<t4909>He had clarified this point with great seriousness, when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the matter.</t4909> <t4910>Although Mrs. Dashwood did not discuss the matter with anyone outside her family, Elinor could see the impact it had on her from the expression of distress on her face and her effort to be polite when she entered the room.</t4910> <t4911>She went so far as to express regret that Elinor and her sister would soon be leaving town, saying that she had hoped to see more of them; her husband, who had brought her into the room and was watching her speech with admiration, seemed to think that her effort was filled with great kindness and grace.</t4911>
<t4912>Another short farewell visit was made to Harley Street; during this visit, Elinor accepted her brother's congratulations for having traveled all the way to Barton without any expense, and completed the brother-sister conversation in the city, as Colonel Brandon would also go to Cleveland after them in a few days; - Fanny also made a vague invitation for them to come to Norland whenever they had the chance, which was unlikely, and John, in a warmer but quieter voice, promised Elinor that he would come to see her very soon in Delaford, thus all the possibilities for meetings outside the city were established.</t4912>
<t4913>Seeing that all her relatives were determined to send her to Delaford amused Elinor; - it was the last place in the world she would want to visit or settle in; because not only was it seen as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy was insistently inviting her to be a guest there when they parted.</t4913>
<t4914>At the very beginning of April, early in the morning, two groups set out from their homes from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street, as agreed, to meet on the road.</t4914> <t4915>To ensure Charlotte and her child's comfort, they would stay on the road for more than two days; Mr. Palmer, who was traveling faster with Colonel Brandon, would join them at Cleveland immediately after their arrival.</t4915>
<t4916>Marianne, who had not spent a single peaceful hour in London and had long wanted to leave, could not bid farewell to the house where she last felt her now forever extinguished hopes and faith regarding Willoughby without great pain when the time came to leave.</t4916> <t4917>She also could not leave the place where Willoughby continued to live in pursuit of new connections and new plans without shedding quite a few tears.</t4917>
<t4918>Elinor's feelings at the moment of departure were more positive.</t4918> <t4919>There was no object for her idle thoughts to fixate on, no one she would momentarily grieve for as she left them forever, she was glad to be free from the torment of Lucy's companionship, happy that she had managed to keep her sister away from Willoughby since her marriage, and she looked to the future with the hope that a few quiet months at Barton would restore Marianne's peace and solidify her own tranquility.</t4919>
<t4920>The journey was completed safely.</t4920> <t4921>On the second day, according to Marianne's changing imagination, they arrived in Somerset, where there was a lover and an outlaw; by noon on the third day, they were in Cleveland.</t4921>
<t4922>Cleveland was a spacious, modern-looking house, situated on a sloping meadow.</t4922> <t4923>It had no park, but the recreational areas were quite extensive; like other places of the same importance, it had an open heath and a more enclosed, wooded walking path, a gravel path that circled around the front from a field; there were trees scattered here and there on the meadow; the house itself was sheltered by pine, oak, and acacia trees, and all together, they formed a thick curtain, including tall black poplars, that concealed the working areas.</t4923>
<t4924>Marianne entered in a state of excitement, knowing that Barton was only eighty miles away and Combe Magna no more than thirty miles away; it had not been five minutes since she had entered the walls of the house when, while the others were busy helping Charlotte show her child to the housekeeper, she went outside again, walked through the winding heaths that had just begun to beautify, to reach a distant height; from there, from a temple in the Greek style, her eyes wandered over a wide expanse of land to the southeast, fixed longingly on the farthest ridge of the hills on the horizon, and she imagined that Combe Magna could be seen from those peaks.</t4924>
<t4925>In such precious, such priceless moments of sorrow, she was overwhelmed with anguished tears for being in Cleveland; while drawing a different circle and returning home, feeling all the happy privilege of rural freedom, of drifting here and there in a rich solitude, she decided to spend almost every hour of every day she stayed with the Palmers on such solitary walks.</t4925>
<t4926>When she returned, the others were just leaving the house to explore the surroundings, she joined them and the remaining hours of the morning passed easily, wandering around the kitchen garden, examining the flowers on the walls, listening to the gardener lamenting about the mold, -lingering in the orangery, seeing the beloved flowers that had been frostbitten and burned due to neglect made Charlotte laugh, while touring the coop, she found new sources of amusement in the hopes dashed by the milkmaid's chickens abandoning their perches or being taken by a fox or the sudden death of a promising young rooster.</t4926>
<t4927>In the morning, the weather was clear and rainless; while planning to explore the surroundings, Marianne had not accounted for a change in the weather during their stay at Cleveland.</t4927> <t4928>Therefore, after lunch, she was greatly surprised to see that continuous rain prevented her from going out again.</t4928> <t4929>She had thought of taking a twilight walk to the Greek temple, or perhaps around the entire estate; a simple evening chill or dampness wouldn't have stopped her; but even she couldn't equate a heavy and continuous rain with dry or pleasant weather for a walk.</t4929>
<t4930>The group was small; time passed quietly.</t4930> <t4931>Mrs. Palmer took care of the child, and Mrs. Jennings worked on the rug; they talked about the friends they had left behind, organized Lady Middleton's social activities, and wondered if Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon could go further than Reading that night.</t4931> <t4932>Although not very interested, Elinor also joined their conversations; while the family kept their distance, Marianne, who had the habit of finding her way to the library in every house, immediately got herself a book.</t4932>
<t4933>Mrs. Palmer did not neglect to show a friendly closeness at all times so that they would feel comfortable.</t4933> <t4934>The openness and sincerity of her behavior more than compensated for her lack of memory and grace, which often made her deficient in terms of the rules of politeness; the kindness supported by such a beautiful face was captivating; although her foolishness was obvious, it was not repulsive because it was not intentional; Elinor could tolerate everything about her except her laughter.</t4934>
<t4935>Two gentlemen arrived the next day at a late dinner hour; they pleasantly expanded the group and added a nice touch to the conversation, which had been quite dull due to a long morning spent with the same incessant rain.</t4935>
<t4936>Elinor had seen very little of Mr. Palmer, and in what little she had seen, his behavior towards her sister and herself was so inconsistent that she was unsure what to expect while observing him within his own family.</t4936> <t4937>However, she saw that he behaved like a perfect gentleman to all his guests and was only occasionally rude to his wife and mother-in-law; she realized that he could be a very pleasant companion and that his tendency to see himself as generally superior to others prevented him from always being so, which was understandable given that he saw himself as much superior to Charlotte and Mrs. Jennings.</t4937> <t4938>As far as Elinor could see, the other aspects of his personality and habits possessed no unusual features for his gender and age.</t4938> <t4939>He ate politely, his hours were irregular; he was fond of his child, though he seemed indifferent; he spent his mornings playing billiards, when he should have been attending to his business.</t4939> <t4940>Elinor liked him more than she had expected and did not regret that she could not like him more; she did not regret that seeing his indulgence, selfishness, and vanity led her to find solace in the memory of Edward's generous nature, simple tastes, and modest feelings.</t4940>
<t4941>She received information from Colonel Brandon about Edward or at least some of his affairs; the Colonel had recently gone to Dorsetshire; since he regarded Mr. Ferrars as a distant friend and himself as a kind of confidant, he spoke at length about the parsonage at Delaford, listed its deficiencies, and explained what he planned to do to address them.</t4941> <t4942>-His behavior towards him in this matter and in every other respect, the joy he felt at seeing him again after only a ten-day separation, his eagerness to converse with him, the importance he placed on his opinions could easily justify Mrs. Jennings' belief that he was in love with him, and moreover, if she did not still believe that his true favorite had always been Marianne from the beginning, Elinor herself might have believed it.</t4942> <t4943>But such a thought had never crossed her mind outside of Mrs. Jennings' insinuations; -while Mrs. Jennings only considered his behavior, she was watching his eyes; -his anxious, affectionate gaze in response to Marianne feeling the onset of a severe cold in her head and throat, because it was not expressed in words, completely escaped the lady's notice; but Elinor could see in those eyes the swift emotions and unnecessary anxiety of a lover.</t4943>
<t4944>On her third and fourth evening there, not only on the dry gravel path of the heath but throughout the entire area, especially on the farthest sides of the land where there was more wilderness than in other places, where the trees were the oldest, the grass the longest and wettest, she took two delightful twilight walks - especially with the added carelessness of sitting with wet shoes and socks, Marianne caught such a cold that, even if it was ignored or denied for a day or two, it showed itself to everyone through increasing discomfort, and finally made her accept it as well.</t4944> <t4945>Prescriptions poured in from all sides and, as usual, all were rejected.</t4945> <t4946>She was weak and feverish, her legs ached, she was coughing, her throat was swollen, a good night's sleep would cure it all; Elinor barely managed to persuade her to try the simplest of remedies before going to bed.</t4946>
<t4947>Marianne got up at her usual time the next morning; she answered every question by saying she was better and tried to prove she was better by attending to her daily tasks.</t4947> <t4948>But after a day spent with an unread book in her hand, shivering in front of the fire, or lying exhausted and weary on a couch, she could no longer claim to be much improved; eventually, when she went to bed early in an even more weakened state, Colonel Brandon was surprised by her sister's calmness; although Elinor had looked after Marianne all day despite her objections and had forced her to take her medicines in the evening, she, like Marianne, trusted in the effect of sleep and did not feel any real concern.</t4948>
<t4949>However, a very uncomfortable and feverish night dashed both of their hopes; when Marianne resisted getting up and then admitted that she couldn't stay on her feet, returning to bed on her own, Elinor decided to follow Mrs. Jennings' advice and call the Palmers' doctor.</t4949>
<t4950>The doctor came, examined the patient, and while giving Miss Dashwood hope that her sister's health would improve in a few days, he mentioned that the disease had a decaying nature by uttering the word "infection," which suddenly caused Mrs. Palmer to worry about her baby.</t4950> <t4951>Mrs. Jennings, who had taken Marianne's complaints more seriously than Elinor from the very beginning, now became even more concerned upon Mr. Harris's report.</t4951>
<t4952>He became serious and insisted that Charlotte should immediately leave with the child, sharing her fears and anxiety; although Mr. Palmer downplayed their concerns, he saw that his wife's fear and panic were too strong to resist.</t4952> <t4953>It was decided that Charlotte would leave; Mr. Harris had not been there for an hour when Charlotte set off with her young son and nanny to the house of a close relative of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles beyond Bath; at her fervent insistence, her husband promised to join her within a day or two; she also almost equally insisted that her mother accompany her.</t4953> <t4954>However, Mrs. Jennings told Elinor with a kindness that truly endeared her to her that she would not move from Cleveland as long as Marianne was ill and would try to take her mother's place with her meticulous care; and Elinor found in her a willing and active helper who strove to share all her fatigue at every moment and often performed important tasks with her nursing experience.</t4954>
<t4955>The poor Marianne, who was weak and lifeless due to the natural effects of the illness and felt sick from head to toe, lost hope of recovery by the next day; the thought of what could have happened tomorrow if it weren't for this unfortunate illness made every symptom even more severe; because that day they were going to return home; one of Mrs. Jennings' servants would accompany them all the way, and the next day at noon they would surprise their mother.</t4955> <t4956>The few words she could utter expressed the sorrow she felt due to this inevitable delay; nevertheless, Elinor tried to cheer her up, attempting to make her believe, as she herself believed at that moment, that the delay would be very short.</t4956>
<t4957>The next day made almost no difference in the patient's condition; he was certainly no better, but apart from the lack of improvement, he didn't seem any worse either.</t4957> <t4958>Their groups had now become even smaller; Mr. Palmer, as much out of genuine humanity and benevolence as to avoid appearing afraid of his wife, finally joined the Colonel, though he did so quite reluctantly.</t4958>
<t4959>Brandon was persuaded to go and keep the promise he made to his wife; as he prepared to leave, Colonel Brandon himself began to talk about leaving with much greater enthusiasm.</t4959> <t4960>-Here, alone, Mrs. Jennings' good-heartedness intervened in a very beneficial way; for she thought that sending the Colonel away while his lover was in so much distress because of her sister would deprive both of them of any comfort; therefore, she said it was essential for him to stay at Cleveland, that she wanted him to play piquet with her in the evening while Miss Dashwood was upstairs with her sister, and she insisted so much that the poor man, who wanted to accept more than anything, couldn't even pretend to hesitate; moreover, Mrs. Jennings' insistence was also strongly supported by Mr. Palmer, who wanted to leave someone behind who could help or advise Miss Dashwood in an emergency, thus putting his mind at ease.</t4960>
<t4961>Of course, Marianne was not informed about these arrangements.</t4961> <t4962>She did not know that Cleveland's owners had to leave their home seven days after their arrival.</t4962> <t4963>Not seeing Mrs. Palmer did not surprise her; moreover, it did not worry her, so she did not mention her name.</t4963>
<t4964>Two days had passed since Mr. Palmer's departure, and the situation continued with small changes.</t4964> <t4965>Mr. Harris, who came every day, still spoke of a rapid recovery; Miss Dashwood was equally optimistic; but the expectations of the others were not so bright.</t4965> <t4966>Mrs. Jennings had decided at the very beginning of the illness that Marianne would not overcome it, and Colonel Brandon, whose main benefit was listening to Mrs. Jennings' premonitions, was not in a state of mind to resist the impact of what he heard.</t4966> <t4967>He tried to dispel his fears by using his reason, because the doctor's different assessment rendered them unnecessary; but the long hours he spent completely alone every day were very conducive to the acceptance of melancholy thoughts, and at those times he could not rid his mind of the belief that he would no longer see Marianne.</t4967>
<t4968>However, on the morning of the third day, the gloomy expectations of both almost became invalid; when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared that the patient was much better.</t4968> <t4969>Her pulse was much stronger; all findings were much better than his previous visit.</t4969> <t4970>Elinor, who was always full of hope, went wild with joy; in the letters she wrote to her mother, she did not take seriously the illness that caused their delay in Cleveland, relying not on her friend's but her own prediction, and she was proud of herself for almost determining when Marianne could travel.</t4970>
<t4971>But the day didn't end as brightly as it started.</t4971> <t4972>Towards the evening, Marianne fell ill again, in a state more severe, more uncomfortable, and more restless than before.</t4972> <t4973>Although her sister remained optimistic, she was inclined to attribute the change to the fatigue from staying up while waiting for the bed to be made; she carefully administered the syrups prescribed and was pleased to see Marianne finally fall into a deep sleep; she expected positive effects from the sleep.</t4973> <t4974>Although her sleep was not as calm as Elinor had hoped, it lasted for quite a while; Elinor decided to stay by her side the entire time to personally observe the outcome of the sleep.</t4974> <t4975>Not expecting any change in the patient, Mrs. Jennings went to bed earlier than usual; one of the head nurses, her maid, was having her meal in the housekeeper's room; Elinor was left alone with Marianne.</t4975>
<t4976>Marianne's rest became increasingly more disturbed; her sister, who was watching her tossing and turning without blinking, listened to the persistent but incomprehensible sounds of complaint coming from her lips and was almost thinking of waking her from such a painful sleep when Marianne, suddenly awakened by a random noise in the house, jumped up in a panic and cried out with feverish wildness,-</t4976>
<t4977>"Is my mom coming?</t4977><t4978>-"</t4978>
<t4979>"Not yet," replied Elinor, trying to hide her fear and helping Marianne lie down again, "but I think he will come very soon.</t4979> <t4980>You know it's a long way from here to Barton.</t4980><t4981>"</t4981>
<t4982>"But it shouldn't come via London," Marianne exclaimed, with the same excitement, "if it comes via London, I will never see it.</t4982><t4983>"</t4983>
<t4984>Elinor realized in horror that she was not herself at that moment; while trying to calm her, she anxiously checked her pulse.</t4984> <t4985>It was lower and faster than usual; as Marianne was still wildly talking about her mother, her fear suddenly increased so much that she immediately decided to send for Mr. Harris and to dispatch a messenger to Barton for her mother.</t4985> <t4986>Right after making the decision, she thought of consulting Colonel Brandon about the best way to send the messenger; she rang the bell, left her place beside her sister to the servant, and hurried down to the dining room, knowing that the Colonel was usually there even at later hours.</t4986>
<t4987>It was not a time to hesitate.</t4987> <t4988>She immediately laid out her fears and difficulties before him.</t4988> <t4989>Colonel Brandon did not have the courage or confidence to try to alleviate her fears; he listened to them in silent sorrow; but he immediately resolved her difficulties with a promptness that seemed to be waiting for an opportunity; he conceived the service to be rendered in his mind and offered to be the messenger to bring Mrs. Dashwood.</t4989> <t4990>Elinor did not raise an objection that could not be easily overcome.</t4990> <t4991>She thanked him with a brief but heartfelt gratitude; while Colonel Brandon went to immediately send his servant to Mr. Harris and to order the carriage horses, Elinor wrote a few lines to her mother.</t4991>
<t4992>How grateful Elinor felt at that moment for having a friend like Colonel Brandon - a companion for her mother who brought such peace! - a companion who would guide her with wisdom, comfort her with care, and soothe her with friendship! - if it were possible to alleviate the shock of such a call, it would be achieved through his presence, his actions, his help.</t4992>
<t4993>Colonel Brandon, meanwhile, regardless of what he might be feeling, acted with the determination of a mind that knew exactly what it was doing, made every necessary adjustment with tremendous skill, and even calculated the hour at which he could expect his return.</t4993> <t4994>No time was lost due to any delay.</t4994> <t4995>The horses arrived even earlier than expected, and Colonel Brandon, with a solemn expression, merely shook Elinor's hand, whispered a few words too softly for her to hear, and hurriedly got into the carriage.</t4995> <t4996>It was around twelve o'clock at that time; Elinor returned to her sister's room to wait for the doctor and to stay by her side for the rest of the night.</t4996> <t4997>It was a night of almost equal agony for both of them.</t4997> <t4998>Until Mr. Harris arrived, the hours passed one after another in sleepless pain and delirium for Marianne, and in cruel anxiety for Elinor.</t4998> <t4999>Once her fears were born, they came back with multiplied force because she had previously been at ease; it did nothing but torment her further by giving clues about the observations of the maid who stayed with Mrs. Jennings, whom she had not allowed to be called.</t4999>
<t5000>Marianne's mind was still intermittently and incoherently fixed on her mother; whenever she mentioned her name, a pang struck Elinor's heart for having taken lightly all those days spent in illness, and she immediately scrambled to find a remedy, fearing that soon all remedies would be in vain, that everything had been delayed too long, and that it might be too late for her suffering mother to see her beloved child or to see her in a sound state of mind.</t5000>
<t5001>He was about to call Mr. Harris again, or someone else if he couldn't come, when Mr. Harris arrived - but after five o'clock.</t5001> <t5002>However, his views somewhat compensated for his lateness, because although he admitted that there was an unexpected and undesirable change in the patient, he did not consider the danger to be significant and spoke encouragingly of the improvement that the new treatment should bring, some of which courage passed on to Elinor.</t5002> <t5003>Mr. Harris promised to visit again in three or four hours and left both the patient and the anxious caregiver in a calmer state than he had found them.</t5003>
<t5004>Mrs. Jennings learned about what had happened the next morning with great concern and considerable reproach for not being called for help.</t5004> <t5005>Her old fears, which had returned for a more justified reason, left no doubt in her mind about the event; -although she tried to say comforting words to Elinor, her belief that her sister was in danger did not allow her to speak hopefully.</t5005> <t5006>Her heart was bleeding.</t5006> <t5007>The rapid decline and early death of a young, beautiful girl like Marianne would sadden even a more indifferent person.</t5007> <t5008>It had other effects on Mrs. Jennings' conscience.</t5008> <t5009>She had been her companion for three months, she was still entrusted to her, it was known that she had suffered a severe wound and had been unhappy for a long time.</t5009> <t5010>The sorrow of her sister, for whom she had a separate affection, was also before her eyes; -as for their mother; Mrs. Jennings thought that Marianne was to her mother what Charlotte was to her, and she felt the mothers' anguish in her heart.</t5010>
<t5011>Mr. Harris was punctual on his second visit; -but he was disappointed by the hopes that the last visit had created.</t5011> <t5012>The medicines had not worked; -the fever had not subsided; Marianne was only calmer -not more herself -and was in a deep faint.</t5012> <t5013>Elinor, realizing all the doctor's fears and more in an instant, suggested consulting others.</t5013> <t5014>But the doctor found this unnecessary; he still had some things to try, some new applications, of which he was as confident as the last, and his visit ended with encouraging words that reached Miss Dashwood's ears but not her heart.</t5014> <t5015>Except for when she thought of her mother, she was calm, but equally hopeless; she continued in this state until noon, not moving from her sister's side for a moment, her thoughts shifting from one painful image to another, from one grieving friend to another; Mrs. Jennings' talks, attributing the severity and danger of this crisis to Marianne's disappointment and weeks of sorrow, further darkened her spirits.</t5015> <t5016>Elinor felt that this idea was correct and a new worry was added to her thoughts.</t5016>
<t5017>Nevertheless, towards noon, she began to imagine and hope that she would find a slight change in her sister's pulse -cautiously -fearing disappointment, so much so that she remained silent even to her friend for a while; -she waited, watched, and looked again and again; -finally, with an excitement that was harder to conceal under her outward calm than all her previous anxieties, she attempted to express her hopes.</t5017> <t5018>Although Mrs. Jennings, upon examining the patient, admitted there was a temporary improvement, she tried to prevent her young friend from getting carried away with the thought that it would continue; -Elinor, who took every kind of warning seriously, also told herself not to get her hopes up in the same way.</t5018> <t5019>But it was already too late.</t5019> <t5020>Hope had once been born; feeling all its insistent flutterings, she leaned over her sister to watch her -without knowing what she hoped to see.</t5020> <t5021>Half an hour passed, the positive sign was still there.</t5021> <t5022>Other signs emerged to strengthen it.</t5022> <t5023>Her breath, her skin, her lips, all gave Elinor joy with signs of improvement, and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a look that, though weary, was aware.</t5023> <t5024>Then anxiety and hope made her equally tense, giving her no comfort for even a moment, until Mr. Harris arrived at four o'clock; -Mr. Harris gave her courage and peace by saying that her sister's signs of recovery exceeded his expectations, leaving her in tears of joy.</t5024>
<t5025>Marianne was much better in every way; Mr. Harris said that the danger had completely passed.</t5025> <t5026>Perhaps satisfied by the partial justification of her last fears and bad feelings, Mrs. Jennings agreed to trust Mr. Harris's opinions and, with unfeigned cheerfulness, soon accepted the possibility of a complete recovery with evident joy.</t5026>
<t5027>Elinor could not feel joy.</t5027> <t5028>Her happiness was of a different kind and extended to something beyond lightness.</t5028> <t5029>Marianne's return to life, to health, to her friends, and to her affectionate mother ca-</t5029>
<t5030>The thought of meeting filled her heart with infinite peace and strengthened her with passionate gratitude; -but it did not create any display of joy, any word, any smile outwardly.</t5030> <t5031>The only thing inside Elinor was joy, silent and strong.</t5031>
<t5032>He hardly left his sister's side all afternoon, soothed every fear of her frail soul, answered every question, attended to every distress, and watched almost every glance and every breath.</t5032> <t5033>The possibility of her losing consciousness again, of course, sometimes crossed his mind and reminded him of what fear was - but when he saw in his frequent and meticulous examinations that every sign of recovery persisted, and finally at six o'clock when he saw Marianne fall into a calm, regular, and in every way comfortable sleep, he cast all doubts from his mind.</t5033>
<t5034>The time when Colonel Brandon could be expected to return was now approaching.</t5034> <t5035>She believed that at ten o'clock or a little later, his mother could be freed from the terrible doubt she was in while traveling towards them.</t5035> <t5036>And the Colonel too! - he was in no less pitiable a state!</t5036> <t5037>-How slowly the time that still kept them unaware was progressing!</t5037>
<t5038>At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined Mrs. Jennings, who was having tea in the sitting room.</t5038> <t5039>Her fears had prevented her from eating properly at breakfast, and contrary emotions had done the same at dinner; -so now, feeling at peace, she quite enjoyed having a snack.</t5039> <t5040>At the end of the tea, Mrs. Jennings tried to persuade her to rest a little before her mother arrived and to leave her place beside Marianne to herself; but Elinor did not feel tired, she did not have any sensation of being able to sleep at that moment, and she did not want to leave her sister's side unnecessarily even for a moment.</t5040> <t5041>Upon this, Mrs. Jennings accompanied her upstairs to the sickroom, reassured herself that everything was going well, left her there with her duties and thoughts, and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.</t5041>
<t5042>325</t5042>
<t5043>The night was cold and stormy.</t5043> <t5044>The wind was roaring around the house, the rain was beating against the windows: but Elinor, whose heart was filled with happiness, did not mind.</t5044> <t5045>Marianne slept despite the thunder; as for the travelers - there was a great reward awaiting them for every hardship they were enduring at that moment.</t5045>
<t5046>The clock struck eight.</t5046> <t5047>If it had struck ten, Elinor would have believed she heard a carriage approaching the house at that moment; but her belief was so strong that, although it was almost impossible for them to have arrived yet, she went into the adjoining dressing room to see the truth and opened one of the window panes.</t5047> <t5048>At that moment, she saw that her ears had not deceived her.</t5048> <t5049>The carriage's shining lamps appeared at that moment.</t5049> <t5050>Judging by its unsteady lights, it was a four-horse carriage; this explained both the measure of her mother's anxiety and their unexpected speed.</t5050>
<t5051>It had never been as difficult for Elinor to stay calm as it was at that moment.</t5051> <t5052>When the car stopped at the door, thinking about what her mother might be feeling - her doubt, her fear - perhaps her despair! - and what Elinor was going to say! made it impossible to stay calm.</t5052> <t5053>The only thing to do was to hurry; so, she waited only until she could leave her sister with Mrs. Jennings' maid and quickly went downstairs.</t5053>
<t5054>As he proceeded along the inner corridor, he realized they had already entered upon hearing the commotion in the hall.</t5054> <t5055>He hurried towards the living room, -entered, -and saw only Willoughby.</t5055>
<t5056>When she saw him, Elinor, who recoiled in horror, listened to the first reaction of her heart and turned to leave the room immediately; her hand was just on the lock when her movement was interrupted: Willoughby, advancing hurriedly, said in a voice closer to a command than a request,</t5056>
<t5057>"Miss Dashwood, stay for half an hour - ten minutes - I beg you.</t5057><t5058>"</t5058>
<t5059>"No, sir," replied Elinor firmly, "I will not stay.</t5059> <t5060>Your business cannot be with me.</t5060> <t5061>I believe the servants forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer is not at home."</t5061><t5062></t5062>
<t5063>"Even if they told me that Mr. Palmer and all his relatives had turned into devils," said Willoughby angrily, "I still wouldn't turn back at the door.</t5063> <t5064>My business is with you, only with you.</t5064><t5065>"</t5065>
<t5066>"With me!" -with great astonishment -"well, sir -be quick -and if possible, be more polite.</t5066><t5067>"</t5067>
<t5068>"Sit down, both of you, alright."</t5068><t5069>"</t5069>
<t5070>Elinor hesitated; she did not know what to do.</t5070> <t5071>The possibility of Colonel Brandon coming and finding her there crossed her mind.</t5071> <t5072>But she had promised to listen to him, and both her sense of honor and curiosity were involved.</t5072> <t5073>Therefore, after thinking for a moment, she decided that common sense required the matter to be resolved as soon as possible, and the way to achieve this was to agree. She then walked quietly to the table and sat down.</t5073> <t5074>Willoughby took the chair opposite her, and for half a minute, neither of them said a word.</t5074>
<t5075>"Please hurry, sir," said Elinor impatiently, "I don't have time to spare."</t5075><t5076>"</t5076>
<t5077>Willoughby was sitting in a state of deep thought; he seemed not to have heard.</t5077>
<t5078>"Your sister," he said suddenly, a moment later -"has overcome the danger.</t5078> <t5079>I heard it from the servant.</t5079> <t5080>Thank God!</t5080> <t5081>-But is it true? -is it really true?</t5081><t5082>"</t5082>
<t5083>Elinor did not speak.</t5083> <t5084>Willoughby repeated the question with greater insistence.</t5084>
<t5085>"For God's sake, tell me, he's out of danger, isn't he?</t5085><t5086>"</t5086>
<t5087>"We hope he/she has overcome it.</t5087><t5088>"</t5088>
<t5089>Willoughby stood up and began to walk around the room.</t5089>
<t5090>"If I had known this half an hour ago - But since I came here" - speaking with forced liveliness as he turned to his chair - "what does it matter?</t5090> <t5091>-For once, Miss Dashwood - it may be the last time - let us be cheerful together.</t5091> <t5092>-I am in a mood ready to be happy.</t5092> <t5093>-Tell me honestly" - a deeper blush spreading across his cheeks - "do you think I am a scoundrel, a deceiver?</t5093><t5094>"</t5094>
<t5095>Elinor looked at him with even greater astonishment than usual.</t5095> <t5096>She thought he must be drunk; such a visit, the oddity of these behaviors, did not seem to be understood in any other way, and with this impression, she immediately got up and said,</t5096>
<t5097>"Mr. Willoughby, I advise you to return to Combe Magna now.</t5097> <t5098>-I do not have the opportunity to stay with you any longer.</t5098> <t5099>-Whatever business you have with me will be better considered and explained tomorrow.</t5099><t5100>"</t5100>
<t5101>"I understand you," replied Willoughby with a meaningful smile and a very calm voice, "yes, I am quite drunk.</t5101> <t5102>-A glass of beer with cold meat in Marlborough was enough to upset me.</t5102><t5103>"</t5103>
<t5104>"In Marlborough!" cried Elinor, becoming even more puzzled about where he was trying to go.</t5104>
<t5105>"Yes - I left London at eight this morning; the only ten minutes I've spent out of my car since then were to grab a bite in Marlborough.</t5105><t5106>"</t5106>
<t5107>The calmness of his behavior and the light in his eyes while speaking convinced Elinor that, whatever unforgivable folly had brought him to Cleveland, it was not brought by a lapse of reason; after a moment of thought, Elinor said,</t5107>
<t5108>"Mr. Willoughby, coming here in this manner after what has happened, forcing yourself upon me, you must understand, it seems to me, requires a very special excuse.</t5108> <t5109>What is it and what do you mean by it?</t5109><t5110>"</t5110>
<t5111>"What I want," said Willoughby, with a serious intensity, "if I can manage it, is to make you hate me a little less than you do now.</t5111> <t5112>To offer some kind of explanation for the past, some kind of apology, to open my whole heart to you and to be forgiven a little by Mar - your sister, by convincing you that although I have always been foolish, I have not always been base.</t5112><t5113>"</t5113>
<t5114>"Is this the real reason for your arrival?</t5114><t5115>"</t5115>
<t5116>"I swear," was the reply, with a warmth that brought back all the old Willoughby and made it hard not to believe it was sincere.</t5116>
<t5117>"If that's all, what you wanted has already happened - Marianne has already forgiven you.</t5117><t5118>"</t5118>
<t5119>"Is that so!" he shouted, in the same insistent voice.</t5119> <t5120>"Then he has forgiven me ahead of time.</t5120> <t5121>But he will forgive me again, and for more reasonable reasons.</t5121> <t5122>-Will you listen to me now?</t5122><t5123>"</t5123>
<t5124>Elinor yielded to her desire.</t5124>
<t5125>"How I behaved towards your sister," said Willoughby, after a silence spent in expectation by Elinor and in thought by himself, "how you explained it, what kind of diabolical impulse you attributed to me, I do not know.</t5125> <t5126>-Perhaps you will not have a better opinion of me, -still it is worth trying; so you will learn everything.</t5126> <t5127>-When I became close with your family, I had no other intention than to spend the time I had to spend in Devonshire pleasantly, even more pleasantly than previous times, by forming acquaintances.</t5127> <t5128>Your sister's beauty and interesting manners pleased me very much; from the very beginning, her behavior towards me was such that -when I think about how it was, how she was, I find it surprising that my heart could be so insensitive!</t5128> <t5129>-But first I must confess that my pride was quite flattered.</t5129> <t5130>Without caring for her happiness, thinking only of my own pleasure, giving myself up to the feelings I was always accustomed to indulging in, I tried as much as I could to make myself liked by her, without considering reciprocating her affection.</t5130><t5131>"</t5131>
<t5132>Miss Dashwood, turning her eyes to him with an angry disdain at this point, stopped him with these words,</t5132>
<t5133>"Mr. Willoughby is no longer worth talking about or listening to.</t5133> <t5134>Such a beginning cannot have a follow-up.</t5134> <t5135>-Do not torment me by saying anything else on this matter.</t5135><t5136>"</t5136>
<t5137>"I insist that you listen to the whole story," replied Willoughby.</t5137> <t5138>"My fortune was never large, and I always had great expenses and the habit of associating with people who had higher incomes than mine.</t5138> <t5139>Since I came of age, and even before that, my debts increased every year; I would have been freed by the death of my elderly cousin Mrs. Smith, but since that event was uncertain and quite distant, I had been thinking for some time of improving my situation by marrying a wealthy woman.</t5139> <t5140>Becoming attached to your sister, therefore, was not something to be considered; -and it was vile, selfish, cruel -so much so that no scornful, no contemptuous look, not even yours Miss Dashwood, can condemn it enough -I was behaving in this way, trying to win her love, without even thinking of reciprocating.</t5140> <t5141>But even in that terrible state of selfish arrogance, the only thing that can be said for me is that I did not know the extent of the suffering I was causing, because I did not know what love was at that time.</t5141> <t5142>Have I ever known love?</t5142> <t5143>-This can be doubted; for if I had truly loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to pride and greed?</t5143> <t5144>-even more, could I have sacrificed her feelings?</t5144> <t5145>-But I did.</t5145> <t5146>By stepping into wealth to escape a poorer life that her love and companionship would have freed from all fears, I lost everything that could have turned that life into a paradise.</t5146><t5147>"</t5147>
<t5148>"Then," said Elinor, softening a little, "you believe that you were once attached to her."</t5148><t5149>"</t5149>
<t5150>"To resist such charm, to withstand such tenderness!</t5150> <t5151>-Is there anyone in life who can achieve this!</t5151> <t5152>-Yes, slowly, I saw that I was sincerely attached to her; the happiest hours of my life were those I spent with her, the hours when my thoughts were honest and my feelings were pure.</t5152> <t5153>But even then, even when I was absolutely determined to express myself to her, I inexplicably postponed the moment of doing so from one day to the next, because I did not want to enter into marriage while my circumstances were so uncomfortable.</t5153> <t5154>I will not reason here -I will not allow you to comment on the utter folly of avoiding giving my faith to a place to which I was already bound by honor.</t5154> <t5155>Events revealed that I was a cunning fool, meticulously seeking the opportunity to make myself forever low and miserable.</t5155> <t5156>Finally, I made my decision; as soon as I found her alone, I would openly declare the love I had been striving to show, justifying the interest I had constantly shown her.</t5156> <t5157>But in the meantime -in the few hours that would pass until I had the opportunity to speak with her privately -something happened -an unfortunate event shattered all my resolve, along with all my peace.</t5157> <t5158>Something was heard," -he paused here and lowered his head.</t5158> <t5159>-"Mrs. Smith somehow learned, probably from a distant relative or someone who had an interest in discrediting me in her eyes, about a relationship, an association of mine -but there's no need to explain further," he added, his face darkening and looking at her with questioning eyes, "a certain friend of yours -you've probably heard the whole story long ago.</t5159><t5160>"</t5160>
<t5161>"I heard," replied Elinor, blushing in the same way and hardening her heart again so as not to pity him, "I heard it all.</t5161> <t5162>And how you will gloss over your guilt in this dreadful affair, I confess I cannot fathom.</t5162><t5163>"</t5163>
<t5164>"The story," Willoughby shouted suddenly, "remember from whom you heard it.</t5164> <t5165>Could it have been told impartially?</t5165> <t5166>I should have respected Eliza's position and personality, I know.</t5166> <t5167>I am not trying to justify myself, but at the same time, I cannot let you think that I have no defense -meaning she becomes blameless because she is wounded, and I become a libertine because she is a saint.</t5167> <t5168>If the intensity of her passion, the weakness of her mind -yet of course, I am not trying to defend myself.</t5168> <t5169>Her love for me deserved better treatment; I often recall with great regret that love which was strong enough to be reciprocated, even if only for a very short time.</t5169> <t5170>I wish -I wish it had never happened.</t5170> <t5171>But I hurt someone more than her; I hurt someone whose love for me - (can I say it?) was no less warm than hers; and her mind -oh, it was far superior!"-</t5171>
<t5172>"Nevertheless, your indifference towards that unfortunate girl - I must say that discussing such a matter is very unpleasant for me - your indifference cannot be an excuse for cruelly neglecting her.</t5172> <t5173>Do not think that her weakness, her lack of reason justifies your so obvious cruelty.</t5173> <t5174>While you were in Devonshire, pursuing new plans, cheerful, happy, and enjoying yourself, you knew she was condemned to the harshest poverty.</t5174><t5175>"</t5175>
<t5176>"I swear I didn't know," replied Willoughby; "it never occurred to me that I might have neglected to give her my address; a little common sense would have told her how to find it.</t5176><t5177>"</t5177>
<t5178>"Well sir, what did Mrs. Smith say?"</t5178><t5179>"</t5179>
<t5180>"He immediately imposed the penalty; you can imagine how shaken I was.</t5180> <t5181>The purity of his life, the formality of his ideas, the ignorance of the world - everything was against me.</t5181> <t5182>The matter itself was undeniable, and any attempt to mitigate it would be in vain.</t5182> <t5183>Moreover, I believe he generally tended to doubt the morality of my behavior, and he was also offended by the little attention and time I gave him during this visit.</t5183> <t5184>In short, in the end, our paths diverged.</t5184> <t5185>There was only one way for me to save myself.</t5185> <t5186>If I married Eliza, the good-hearted woman, driven by a sense of honor, said she would forgive the past.</t5186> <t5187>But this was impossible - so I was formally expelled from her favor and her house.</t5187> <t5188>I spent the night following this matter - I was to leave the next morning - thinking about what my future conduct should be.</t5188> <t5189>The struggle was great - but it ended very quickly.</t5189> <t5190>My love for Marianne, my infinite faith in her devotion to me - none of it was enough to overcome the fear of poverty or to defeat the wrong ideas about the need for luxury, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and my life among people who lived expensive lives had increased this need.</t5190> <t5191>I had reasons to feel secure about my current wife, of course, if I proposed to her; thus, I decided there was nothing else to be done for me.</t5191> <t5192>However, before leaving Devonshire, a heavy event awaited me; - I had promised to dine with you that day; therefore, I needed to apologize for breaking my promise.</t5192> <t5193>But I hesitated for a long time whether to write this apology or to deliver it in person.</t5193> <t5194>I felt it would be terrible to see Marianne, I even doubted whether I could see her again and stick to my decision.</t5194> <t5195>However, at that point, I had underestimated my own nobility, as the event showed; because I went, I saw her, I saw she was miserable and left her in that miserable state - and I parted from her hoping never to see her again.</t5195><t5196>"</t5196>
<t5197>"Why did you come, Mr. Willoughby?" said Elinor, displeased; "a note would have sufficed in every way.</t5197> <t5198>-Why was it necessary for you to come?</t5198><t5199>"</t5199>
<t5200>"It was necessary for my own honor.</t5200> <t5201>I couldn't leave the village in a manner that might leave you or the other people around in doubt about what really happened between Mrs. Smith and me - so I was determined to stop by the cottage on my way to Honiton.</t5201> <t5202>But the sight of your dear sister was truly dreadful and, to make matters worse, I found her alone.</t5202> <t5203>I don't know where you had gone.</t5203> <t5204>I had left her the previous night so convinced, so determined that I had done the right thing!</t5204> <t5205>If a few more hours had passed, she would have been forever engaged to me; I remember how happy, how cheerful I was while walking from the cottage to Allenham, how pleased I was with myself, how content I was with everyone!</t5205> <t5206>But in this, our last friendly meeting, I approached her with a sense of guilt that stripped me of all my ability to conceal.</t5206> <t5207>The sadness, disappointment, deep sorrow when I told her I had to leave Devonshire immediately - I'll never forget it combined with the trust, the faith she had in me! - Oh God! What a heartless donkey I was!"</t5207>
<t5208>For a few seconds, both of them remained silent.</t5208> <t5209>Elinor spoke first.</t5209>
<t5210>"Did you tell her that you would return soon?</t5210><t5211>"</t5211>
<t5212>"I don't know what I said to her," replied Willoughby impatiently; "but certainly less than the past required, and undoubtedly more than the future justified.</t5212> <t5213>I can't think.</t5213> <t5214>-It's not working.</t5214> <t5215>-Then your dear mother came to torment me further with all her kindness and trust.</t5215> <t5216>Thank God! it was torture to me.</t5216> <t5217>I was miserable.</t5217> <t5218>Miss Dashwood, you cannot imagine how comforting it is for me to recall my own misery.</t5218> <t5219>I hate myself so much for the foolishness, the disgraceful stupidity of my heart, that all the suffering I endured in the past now seems to me only like triumph and pleasure.</t5219> <t5220>Anyway, I left, leaving everything I loved behind and went to people to whom I was at best indifferent.</t5220> <t5221>The journey to the city - I was going with my own horses, so it was very tedious - there was no one to talk to - my own thoughts were so cheerful - everything ahead looked so inviting!</t5221> <t5222>-when I looked back at Barton, the view was so peaceful! -what a happy journey it was!</t5222><t5223>"</t5223>
<t5224>It stopped.</t5224>
<t5225>"Well, sir," said Elinor, though she felt sorry for him, she had begun to grow impatient for him to leave, "is that all?</t5225><t5226>"</t5226>
<t5227>"All of them! -no, -did you forget those in the city?</t5227> <t5228>-That disgraceful letter -Did he show it to you?</t5228><t5229>"</t5229>
<t5230>"Yes, I saw every word."</t5230><t5231>"</t5231>
<t5232>"When her first letter reached me, (it reached me immediately, because I was always in the city,) what I felt - you know how it's always said, it can't be expressed; in simpler terms - perhaps too simple to affect anyone - my feelings were very, very painful.</t5232> <t5233>-Every line, every word - like a cliché metaphor that dear writer would forbid if he were here - was like a dagger stabbing into my heart.</t5233> <t5234>Knowing that Marianne was in the city - it was like a lightning strike in the same language.</t5234> <t5235>-Lightning and daggers! - how he would scold me!</t5235> <t5236>-his taste, his ideas - I believe I know them better than my own, - and I know they are much more valuable.</t5236><t5237>"</t5237>
<t5238>In the flow of this extraordinary conversation, Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes, now softened again; -yet she considered it her duty to keep her interlocutor's ideas in check.</t5238>
<t5239>"This is not true, Mr. Willoughby.</t5239> <t5240>-Remember that you are married.</t5240> <t5241>-If you think there is something I need to know in my conscience, just tell me that.</t5241><t5242>"</t5242>
<t5243>"Marianne's letter, saying that despite being apart for weeks, I was still as valuable to her as in the old days, that her feelings were still the same, and that she believed my feelings hadn't changed either, awakened all my remorse.</t5243> <t5244>I say awakened because time and London, work and debauchery had somewhat soothed it, and I was becoming a thoroughly hardened scoundrel, thinking myself indifferent to her and preferring to believe that she should be indifferent to me; I told myself that our past closeness was a trivial, insignificant matter, shrugged it off to believe it was so, silenced every rebuke, overcame every doubt, and occasionally said to myself, 'I will truly be glad to hear that she has made a good marriage.'</t5244> <t5245>-But this letter made me understand myself better.</t5245> <t5246>I felt that she was more valuable to me than all the women in the world, and that I had behaved despicably towards her.</t5246> <t5247>But by then, everything between Miss Grey and me was already settled.</t5247> <t5248>It was impossible to retreat.</t5248> <t5249>All I could do was to flee from both of you.</t5249> <t5250>I did not reply to Marianne, thinking this would protect me from her interest; for a while, I even decided not to visit Berkeley Street; -but in the end, I decided that it would be wiser to adopt an indifferent, ordinary acquaintance attitude rather than anything else, and one morning, after watching all of you leave the house, I left my name.</t5250><t5251>"</t5251>
<t5252>"Did you watch us leave the house!"</t5252><t5253>"</t5253>
<t5254>"Yes.</t5254> <t5255>You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how often I came to the point of approaching you.</t5255> <t5256>As the carriage passed by, I kept entering shops to avoid being seen by you.</t5256> <t5257>Since I was staying on Bond Street, not a single day passed without one of you catching my eye; nothing but a constant vigilance with unwavering determination to avoid being seen by you could have kept us apart for so long.</t5257> <t5258>I avoided the Middletons as much as possible, and everyone else who might be a mutual acquaintance.</t5258> <t5259>But I didn't know they were in town; I ran into Sir John, probably on the first day of his arrival, and the day after I visited Mrs. Jennings.</t5259> <t5260>He invited me to a party, a dance, at his house that evening.</t5260> <t5261>Even if he hadn't said that you and your sister would be there to encourage me, I would have guessed without needing to ask.</t5261> <t5262>The next morning, I received another short letter from Marianne -again loving, candid, unaffected, faithful -everything that would make my behavior seem disgusting.</t5262> <t5263>I couldn't write a reply.</t5263> <t5264>I tried -but I couldn't form a single sentence.</t5264> <t5265>But I know that I thought of her every moment of the day.</t5265> <t5266>If you are to pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity me for my state at that time.</t5266> <t5267>While my mind and heart were full of your sister, I had to play the role of a happily in love man with another woman!</t5267> <t5268>-Those three or four weeks were the worst.</t5268> <t5269>Finally, needless to say, I encountered you; what a good act I put on!</t5269> <t5270>-what a painful evening it was! -on one side, Marianne, as beautiful as an angel, calling me Willoughby with such a voice!</t5270> <t5271>-oh God! —she extends her hand to me, those speaking, enchanting eyes fixed on me in concern, expecting an explanation!</t5271> <t5272>-and on the other side, Sofia, as jealous as the devil, every glance -well, it doesn't matter, it's over now.</t5272> <t5273>-What an evening!</t5273> <t5274>-At the first opportunity, I fled from you; but I couldn't avoid seeing that Marianne's beautiful face was as white as death.</t5274> <t5275>-That was her last look at me; -the last image I have of her.</t5275> <t5276>It was a terrible image!</t5276> <t5277>But today, thinking that she is truly dying, it has been a kind of solace for me to imagine how she would appear to those who see her last in this world.</t5277> <t5278>As I went along the road, she was always before me, always in the same image and the same color.</t5278><t5279>"</t5279>
<t5280>There was a short silence as both of them fell into thought.</t5280> <t5281>Willoughby collected himself first and broke the silence:</t5281>
<t5282>"Anyway, I should hurry and leave as soon as possible."</t5282> <t5283>"Your sister is probably better, she has probably overcome the danger, hasn't she?"</t5283><t5284>"</t5284>
<t5285>"We are sure of this.</t5285><t5286>"</t5286>
<t5287>"Your poor mother!</t5287> <t5288>-She was so fond of Marianne.</t5288><t5289>"</t5289>
<t5290>"Well, the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your letter; do you have anything to say about it?</t5290><t5291>"</t5291>
<t5292>"Yes, of course, especially that one.</t5292> <t5293>Your sister wrote to me again the very next morning, you know.</t5293> <t5294>You saw what she said.</t5294> <t5295>I was having breakfast at the Elisons' - the letter was brought to me there along with the others from my home.</t5295> <t5296>Before I saw the letter, Sofia saw it - the size, the elegance of the paper, the handwriting immediately made her suspicious.</t5296> <t5297>She had previously heard some slight rumors about my relationship with a young lady in Devonshire; what she saw the previous evening revealed who the young lady was, which greatly increased her jealousy.</t5297> <t5298>She opened and read the letter right away, creating an atmosphere as if she was playing a game that only pleases the woman she loves.</t5298> <t5299>She got a good reward for her indiscretion.</t5299> <t5300>What she read made her miserable.</t5300> <t5301>I could endure her misery, but her ambition - it must be appeased, no matter how evil it may be.</t5301> <t5302>In short - what do you think of my wife's letter-writing style?</t5302> <t5303>-delicate -affectionate -extremely feminine -isn't it?</t5303><t5304>"</t5304>
<t5305>"Your wife!"</t5305> <t5306>"-The letter was written in your handwriting."</t5306><t5307>"</t5307>
<t5308>"Yes, but I only had the privilege of slavishly putting those sentences on paper, sentences I was too ashamed to put my name on.</t5308> <t5309>She wrote the original -with her own unique thoughts and elegant expression.</t5309> <t5310>But what could I do?</t5310> <t5311>-we were engaged, all the preparations were being made, the day was even set -But I'm talking like a fool.</t5311> <t5312>Preparation! -the day! -Honestly, I needed her money, and in a situation like mine, anything would be done to avoid separation.</t5312> <t5313>Besides, how would it affect my character in the eyes of Marianne and her relatives, in which language my response was written?</t5313> <t5314>-It would serve a single purpose.</t5314> <t5315>My job was to declare myself a scoundrel, whether I did it with a drum or quietly, it didn't matter much.</t5315> <t5316>-'I am forever finished in their eyes -I told myself -forever banished from their assemblies, they already see me as a characterless man, after this letter, I will be even more despicable to them.'</t5316> <t5317>Thinking such things, in a hopeless indifference, I put my wife's words on paper and parted from Marianne's last keepsakes.</t5317>
<t5318>His three letters -unfortunately, they were all inside my notebook, otherwise I would deny their existence and keep them for life -I had to take them out too, and I didn't even have a chance to kiss them.</t5318> <t5319>And the lock of hair -I always carried it inside the same notebook; Madam, in a rather charming fit of anger, searched the notebook too, -that beloved hair -everything, every memory was torn away from me.</t5319><t5320>"</t5320>
<t5321>"You are making a mistake, Mr. Willoughby, you are behaving wrongly," said Elinor; her voice, involuntarily, revealed the pity she felt; "you should not speak this way, neither about Mrs. Willoughby nor about my sister.</t5321> <t5322>You made your choice.</t5322> <t5323>No one forced you.</t5323> <t5324>Your wife has the right to see kindness from you, at the very least she has the right to see respect.</t5324> <t5325>She must love you, otherwise she wouldn't have married you.</t5325> <t5326>Being rude to her, speaking of her with disdain will not make up for anything with Marianne - and I don't think it will ease your conscience either.</t5326><t5327>"</t5327>
<t5328>"Do not speak to me of my wife," said Willoughby with a heavy sigh.</t5328> <t5329>-"She does not deserve your pity.</t5329> <t5330>-She knew I did not care for her when we married.</t5330> <t5331>-Anyway, we got married and came to Combe Magna to be happy, then returned to the city for amusement.</t5331> <t5332>-Now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood? -or did I tell you all this in vain?</t5332> <t5333>-Do you see me as less guilty -to some degree at least?</t5333> <t5334>-My intentions were not always bad.</t5334> <t5335>Have I been able to explain any part of my guilt?</t5335><t5336>"</t5336>
<t5337>"Yes, of course, you have remedied some things -very few, but.</t5337> <t5338>You have shown that you are less flawed than I thought.</t5338> <t5339>You have revealed that your insides are not so bad -not bad at all.</t5339> <t5340>But I don't quite know -the destruction you caused -I don't quite know how it could be worse.</t5340><t5341>"</t5341>
<t5342>"When she recovers, could you tell your sister what I have told you?</t5342> <t5343>- I want to feel as reassured about her opinion as I do about yours.</t5343> <t5344>You said she has already forgiven me.</t5344> <t5345>I want to imagine that if she knows my condition and current feelings better, she might forgive me more spontaneously, more naturally, and with less pride.</t5345> <t5346>Tell her about the misery and torment I have endured - that my heart has never betrayed her, and please, tell her that she is more valuable to me now than ever before.</t5346><t5347>"</t5347>
<t5348>"I will tell her everything that might be necessary for her to understand you.</t5348> <t5349>But you haven't explained to me why you came now, nor how you heard about her illness.</t5349><t5350>"</t5350>
<t5351>"Last night, I ran into Sir John Middleton in the lobby of the Drury Lane Theatre; when he saw who I was - for the first time in two months, he spoke to me.</t5351> <t5352>Since I got married, he had cut me off, I knew it, I wasn't surprised or offended.</t5352> <t5353>But now, he couldn't resist the urge to tell me something that would crush me - but maybe he didn't know - with his anger towards me, his concern for your sister, his well-meaning, honest, and naive mind.</t5353> <t5354>Without beating around the bush, he told me that Marianne was dying of an infectious fever at Cleveland - the letter he received from Mrs. Jennings that morning said the danger was very close - the Palmers had fled in fear, and so on.</t5354> <t5355>-I was so shaken that even that rough Sir John couldn't remain indifferent.</t5355> <t5356>When he saw I was in pain, his heart softened, most of his hostility disappeared, so much so that when we parted, he almost shook my hand and reminded me of an old promise I had made to him about a pointer puppy.</t5356> <t5357>When I heard that your sister was dying - and dying believing that I was the greatest scoundrel in the world, hating me even in her final moments - what I felt - well, you know, what terrible possibilities don't come to mind?</t5357> <t5358>-I knew that one person saw me as capable of anything - I felt terrible things!</t5358> <t5359>-I made a quick decision and got into my carriage at eight o'clock this morning.</t5359> <t5360>Now you know everything.</t5360><t5361>"</t5361>
<t5362>Elinor did not respond.</t5362> <t5363>She stood silently, contemplating the irreparable damage that an early independence, followed by habits of idleness, debauchery, and luxury, had inflicted on the mind, character, and happiness of a man who combined an open and honest personality with a sensitive, affectionate heart, and who possessed many superior qualities in appearance and abilities.</t5363> <t5364>The world had made him extravagant and fond of ostentation - Extravagance and pride had made him cold-hearted and selfish.</t5364> <t5365>Pride, which sought to declare its own guilty victory by destroying other qualities, had led him to a true companionship, which then required the sacrifice of extravagance or the need born of extravagance.</t5365> <t5366>Every flawed desire that led him to a bad end had also led him to punishment in the same way.</t5366> <t5367>The companionship he had effectively severed by trampling on honesty, feelings, and the opportunity for happiness, now ruled his entire mind when it was no longer within his reach; the marriage for which he had unhesitatingly sacrificed his sister had become for him a source of much more incurable unhappiness.</t5367> <t5368>A few seconds later, Willoughby pulled her out of these thoughts; he had also pulled himself out of equally painful thoughts, and preparing to leave, he said,</t5368>
<t5369>"There is no benefit in staying here; I must go."</t5369><t5370>"</t5370>
<t5371>"Are you returning to the city?</t5371><t5372>"</t5372>
<t5373>"No - to Combe Magna.</t5373> <t5374>I have business, I'll go from there to the city in a day or two.</t5374> <t5375>Goodbye.</t5375><t5376>"</t5376>
<t5377>He extended his hand.</t5377> <t5378>Elinor could not refrain from extending her hand to him; Willoughby shook it affectionately.</t5378>
<t5379>"Do you think better of me than you did before?" he said, leaning against the mantelpiece as if he had forgotten he was about to leave, while letting go of her hand.</t5379>
<t5380>Elinor assured him that she thought of him; that she forgave him, that she sympathized with him, that she wished him well - even that she was concerned with his happiness - and she offered a few kind suggestions regarding behaviors that might ensure it.</t5380> <t5381>Willoughby's response was not very promising.</t5381>
<t5382>"On that matter," he said, "I will just live on as best as I can.</t5382> <t5383>Family happiness is out of the question.</t5383> <t5384>But if I may have the permission to think that you and your loved ones are interested in my fate and actions, perhaps through this - I mean, it might bring me to my senses - there would at least be something to live for.</t5384> <t5385>I have lost Marianne forever now.</t5385> <t5386>Even if fate allows me to be free again-"</t5386>
<t5387>Elinor stopped him by scolding.</t5387>
<t5388>"Very well," replied Willoughby, "goodbye again.</t5388> <t5389>Now I will go and live in the horror of that event.</t5389><t5390>"</t5390>
<t5391>"What do you mean?</t5391><t5392>"</t5392>
<t5393>"Your sister's marriage.</t5393><t5394>"</t5394>
<t5395>"You are mistaken.</t5395> <t5396>You cannot lose him more than you already have.</t5396><t5397>"</t5397>
<t5398>"But someone else will win her.</t5398> <t5399>If that someone is the one I can least bear among everyone else - But I will not stay any longer and deprive myself of all your tolerance by pretending that I am the most innocent where I have caused the most pain.</t5399> <t5400>Goodbye, -God bless you!</t5400><t5401>"</t5401>
<t5402>And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.</t5402>
<t5403>After Elinor left, for a while, even after the sound of her car faded away, she was trapped in a crowd of thoughts that were extremely conflicting but had sorrow as their common outcome, so much so that she couldn't even think about her sister.</t5403>
<t5404>Just half an hour ago, Willoughby, whom she had scorned as the lowest man in the world, had evoked in her a certain feeling of pity for the sufferings he endured because of his flaws, despite all his faults: now she thought of him as someone forever torn from his family, with a tenderness and sorrow that she immediately realized were more proportional to his dreams than his virtues.</t5404> <t5405>She felt that the emotion he left on her was heightened due to circumstances that should not have been impressive; -that extraordinary physical charm which could not be counted as a virtue, those open, emotional, cheerful manners, and that still passionate love he felt for Marianne, which was too innocent to even dwell upon.</t5405> <t5406>But she felt this long, long after Willoughby's influence had waned.</t5406>
<t5407>When he finally returned to Marianne, who was sleeping unaware of everything, he saw that she was waking up, refreshed by a sleep as long and sweet as he had hoped.</t5407> <t5408>All of Elinor's emotions were stirred.</t5408> <t5409>The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's health, and her mother's expec-</t5409>
<t5410>His arrival, all of it together, drove him into such excitement that all signs of fatigue disappeared, and only the fear of revealing himself to his sister remained inside him.</t5410> <t5411>On the other hand, there was no time for this fear to affect him, because it had not even been an hour since Willoughby had left when another car sound called him downstairs again.</t5411> <t5412>To spare his mother from experiencing that horror unnecessarily for another moment, he immediately ran to the hall and reached the front door just in time to meet and reassure his mother as she entered.</t5412>
<t5413>As they approached the house, the horror Mrs. Dashwood felt had almost convinced her that Marianne was no longer alive; she was in no state to ask how she was; she was in no state to speak with Elinor; but Elinor, who neither expected a greeting nor a question, immediately gave her the happy news; -her mother, who clung to the news with all her usual fervor, was on the verge of collapsing from fear until that moment, and then collapsed from happiness.</t5413> <t5414>She was taken to the sitting room between the support of her daughter and her friend; -there, though still unable to speak, she repeatedly embraced Elinor with tears of joy, occasionally turning to shake Colonel Brandon's hand, expressing both her gratitude and her belief that he shared in her current happiness with her glances.</t5414> <t5415>Colonel Brandon, of course, shared this happiness in a silence even greater than hers.</t5415>
<t5416>As soon as Mrs. Dashwood came to her senses, her first desire was to see Marianne; within two minutes, she was reunited with her beloved child, to whom she was now more attached than ever due to her absence, unhappiness, and illness.</t5416> <t5417>Elinor's happiness at seeing their emotions upon meeting was only diminished by the thought that this reunion might prevent Marianne from sleeping more; but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm and even sensible when her child's life was in danger; Marianne, pleased to know her mother was by her side, aware that she was too exhausted to speak, willingly surrendered herself to the silence and calm that every nurse around her demanded.</t5417> <t5418>Mrs. Dashwood would sit by her side all night; Elinor, complying with her mother's wish, went to bed.</t5418> <t5419>But the rest necessitated by a completely sleepless night and hours filled with exhausting anxiety was impossible because her mind was still active.</t5419> <t5420>Willoughby, now she called him "poor Willoughby," was constantly on her mind; his attempts to defend himself still echoed in her ears, and she felt guilty for having judged him so harshly before; she felt justified.</t5420> <t5421>But the promise she had made to tell her sister about it was equally painful.</t5421> <t5422>She was afraid to tell, afraid of the possible effects on Marianne; she doubted whether Marianne could ever be happy with someone else after such an explanation and for a moment wished that Willoughby would remain a widower.</t5422> <t5423>Then Colonel Brandon came to her mind, and she felt ashamed, feeling that her sister's reward should be for his sufferings and loyalty, not for his rival's, and she thought, let Mrs. Willoughby live, whatever happens.</t5423>
<t5424>The shock of Colonel Brandon's arrival as an envoy to Barton was not too great due to Mrs. Dashwood's already growing fear; she was so anxious about Marianne that she had decided to go to Cleveland that day without waiting for further news and had made travel preparations before Colonel Brandon arrived, so much so that the Careys were expected to come for Margaret at any moment because her mother did not want to take her to a place that might be infected.</t5424>
<t5425>Marianne continued to recover every day; the radiant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's appearance and movements, as she often said, showed that she was one of the happiest women in the world.</t5425> <t5426>While Elinor listened to her mother's words or watched her movements, she occasionally couldn't help but wonder if her mother remembered Edward.</t5426> <t5427>But trusting in the mild explanation Elinor had given about her disappointment, Mrs. Dashwood was carried away by her exuberant cheerfulness, thinking of nothing but things that would further increase her joy.</t5427> <t5428>Marianne had escaped a great danger, and now Mrs. Dashwood was beginning to feel that she had a share in that danger because she had made the mistake of encouraging Marianne in her unfortunate relationship with Willoughby; -and now, as Marianne was recovering, she found another source of joy that hadn't even crossed Elinor's mind.</t5428> <t5429>She explained this to Elinor the first chance they got to be alone.</t5429>
<t5430>"At last, we are alone.</t5430> <t5431>My dear Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness.</t5431> <t5432>Colonel Brandon loves Marianne.</t5432> <t5433>He told me himself.</t5433><t5434>"</t5434>
<t5435>He waited in silent attention for the girl who was alternately happy and annoyed, both surprised and unsurprised.</t5435>
<t5436>"You haven't taken after me at all, dear Elinor, otherwise I would be surprised at your calmness now.</t5436> <t5437>If I were to sit down and wish for something good for my family, my greatest desire would be for Colonel Brandon to marry one of you.</t5437> <t5438>I suppose Marianne would be happier with him out of the two of you.</t5438><t5439>"</t5439>
<t5440>Elinor seemed like she wanted to ask why she thought so, because she believed there could be no reason based on an impartial observation in terms of age, character, or emotion; -but her mother always got carried away with her dreams on any subject that caught her interest; so instead of asking, she dismissed these words with a smile.</t5440>
<t5441>"He poured his heart out to me while we were coming on the road yesterday.</t5441> <t5442>Everything happened suddenly, it happened spontaneously.</t5442> <t5443>As you can imagine, I couldn't talk about anything other than my child; -he couldn't hide his sorrow either; I saw that his sorrow was no less than mine, and perhaps he thought that just friendship wouldn't justify such warm interest -or probably he didn't think at all and surrendered to irresistible feelings, and spoke of his sincere, strong, loyalty-filled love for Marianne.</t5443> <t5444>He has loved her since the first moment he saw her, my dear Elinor.</t5444><t5445>"</t5445>
<t5446>When I arrived, here Elinor sensed not the words or confessions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of an active imagination that adorned everything to her mother's liking.</t5446>
<t5447>"His love for her is far beyond, much warmer, much more genuine and solid than Willoughby's feelings or pretenses -what should we call this -he continued despite knowing dear Marianne's unhappy passion for that worthless young man!</t5447> <t5448>-and he has no selfishness -not even harboring hope! -even though he could see her happy with someone else -Such a noble man! -such sincerity, such openness! -someone who would never deceive anyone.</t5448><t5449>"</t5449>
<t5450>"Colonel Brandon," said Elinor, "is known by everyone to be a remarkable man."</t5450><t5451>"</t5451>
<t5452>"It is known, I know," said her mother seriously, "otherwise, after waking up like this, I should be the last person to encourage his feelings, even to be pleased with his feelings.</t5452> <t5453>But for him to come to me like this, with such usefulness, with such a sincere friendship, is enough to prove that he is a most valuable person.</t5453><t5454>"</t5454>
<t5455>"But of course," replied Elinor, "even if his high character and humanity were not in question, his love for Marianne is not just a single kind act directed by it.</t5455> <t5456>Mrs. Jennings and the Middletons have known him for a long time and closely; they all love and respect him; even I, though I have only recently gotten to know him, appreciate him greatly, value him so much, and respect him so deeply that if Marianne can be happy with him, I am as ready as you to think that it is the greatest gift we could be given in this world.</t5456> <t5457>What did you answer him?</t5457> <t5458>-Did you allow him to hope?</t5458><t5459>"</t5459>
<t5460>"Ah my child, at that moment I couldn't speak of hope to either her or myself: Marianne could have been dying at that very moment.</t5460> <t5461>But she didn't want hope or courage anyway.</t5461> <t5462>Hers was an involuntary lament, an irresistible confession made to a comforting friend, -not an appeal made to a parent.</t5462> <t5463>But after a while I said, because at first I was very bad -if she lives, I said, and she will live, I believe, my greatest happiness in the world would be to support their marriage; since we arrived, since we safely overcame the danger, I told her this again more fully, I gave her all the courage I could.</t5463> <t5464>Time, a little time, I will tell her, will solve everything; -Marianne's heart will not forever pine for a man like Willoughby.</t5464> <t5465>-Colonel Brandon, with these virtues, will soon reach a conclusion.</t5465><t5466>"</t5466>
<t5467>"Judging by the Colonel's mood, you haven't made him this optimistic yet."</t5467><t5468>"</t5468>
<t5469>"No.</t5469> <t5470>-He thinks Marianne's love is too deep to change for a very long time, and even if her heart were free again, he is too insecure to believe he could win her over with such a difference in age and temperament.</t5470> <t5471>At that point, however, he is mistaken.</t5471> <t5472>His age is just enough to be distinguished from Marianne, enough to make his personality and principles well-established; -and his temperament, I am sure, is exactly what would make her sister happy.</t5472> <t5473>His appearance, his movements, all those things also earn him points.</t5473> <t5474>My feelings do not blind me; of course, he is not as handsome as Willoughby; -but at the same time, there is something much more pleasant in his face.</t5474> <t5475>-If you remember, there was always something in Willoughby's eyes that I did not like.</t5475><t5476>"</t5476>
<t5477>Elinor couldn't remember; -but her mother continued without waiting for her approval,</t5477>
<t5478>"Then his movements, the Colonel's movements not only seem more pleasant to me than Willoughby's, but they are also the kind that will be quite attractive to Marianne.</t5478> <t5479>The courtesy in his movements, the genuine care for others, and the manly, natural simplicity are much more suited to his true temperament than the other's artificial and indiscreet liveliness.</t5479> <t5480>I am personally convinced that even if Willoughby had proven to be truly decent, Marianne would still not have been as happy with him as she would be with Colonel Brandon.</t5480><t5481>"</t5481>
<t5482>He stopped.</t5482> <t5483>-His daughter didn't quite agree with him, but her objection wasn't heard and therefore didn't cause any annoyance.</t5483>
<t5484>"I would also be very close in Delaford," added Mrs. Dashwood, "even if I stayed in Barton; but surely, -because I hear it is a large village, there must be a small house, a cottage or something that suits our current situation.</t5484><t5485>"</t5485>
<t5486>Poor Elinor! -now there was a new plan to take her to Delaford!</t5486> <t5487>-but her nature was also stubborn.</t5487>
<t5488>"Then the wealth too! -because in this era, you know, everyone looks at this; -although I don't know what wealth is, nor do I want to know, but obviously it must be a good thing.</t5488><t5489>"</t5489>
<t5490>Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a third person into the room, and Elinor withdrew to ponder all these matters alone, to wish her friend success, but at the same time to feel sorrow for Willoughby.</t5490>
<t5491>Although Marianne's illness had weakened her, it had not lasted long enough to make her recovery slow; youth, a strong constitution, and her mother's presence also helped, and within four days of her mother's arrival, she was well enough to go to Mrs. Palmer's sitting room.</t5491> <t5492>Here, at her own request, because she was eager to shower him with thanks for bringing her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.</t5492>
<t5493>When he entered the room, saw her changed face, and immediately took the pale hand she extended to him, the Colonel was so moved that, according to Elinor, the reason was more than just his love for Marianne or knowing that others were aware of this love; as Elinor looked at her sister, she saw in her dreamy eyes and changing complexion many sorrowful memories from the past, likely brought to mind by the resemblance between Marianne and Eliza that he had mentioned before, and further intensified by the sunken eyes, sickly complexion, feeble posture, and fervent expression of gratitude.</t5493>
<t5494>Mrs. Dashwood, who was observing the events as carefully as her daughter but with different thoughts and therefore drawing different conclusions, saw nothing in the Colonel's behavior beyond what the simplest and most ordinary feelings would suggest. However, she convinced herself that something more than gratitude had already arisen by looking at Marianne's actions and words.</t5494>
<t5495>After a couple of days, Marianne was visibly getting stronger every day; Mrs. Dashwood, listening to both her own desire and her daughter's, began talking about going to Barton.</t5495> <t5496>The decisions of her two friends were also dependent on her decision: Mrs. Jennings could not leave Cleveland as long as the Dashwoods were there, and Colonel Brandon, at the request of everyone, had to accept that his stay there was equally desirable, if not equally indispensable.</t5496> <t5497>Then, at the joint request of Colonel Brandon and Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Dashwood was persuaded to use Colonel Brandon's carriage on the return journey for the comfort of her sick child; thanks to her active benevolence, Mrs. Jennings, who seemed friendly and hospitable to everyone, and Mrs. Dashwood jointly invited the Colonel to visit the cottage within a few weeks, which he gladly accepted as a reward.</t5497>
<t5498>The day of departure and farewell arrived; Marianne, as if secretly acknowledging her past indifference, now acted with utmost gratitude, respect, and affection towards Mrs. Jennings, bidding her a warm and lengthy farewell. She said goodbye to Colonel Brandon with friendly courtesy and was then helped into the carriage with his careful support; it even seemed as if the Colonel was worried that at least half of the carriage should belong solely to her.</t5498> <t5499>Afterwards, Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor also got in, leaving the others to themselves, to talk about the travelers and to feel their own boredom. Eventually, Mrs. Jennings was called to her carriage and consoled herself by chatting with her servant about the two young friends she had lost; shortly thereafter, Colonel Brandon set off alone towards Delaford.</t5499>
<t5500>They spent two days on the road; Marianne endured the entire journey without feeling significant fatigue.</t5500> <t5501>The entire concern of her two attentive travel companions was to make her comfortable with great kindness and sensitive care; as they saw her body at ease and her mind calm, they felt they had received the full reward for their efforts.</t5501> <t5502>Marianne felt particularly grateful to Elinor for her effort to maintain tranquility.</t5502> <t5503>Having watched Marianne suffer continuously for weeks under the burden of heartache that she neither had the courage to express nor the strength to conceal, Elinor now saw a clear serenity in her with a joy that nothing else could create, believing it to be the result of a serious effort of thought that would eventually bring her peace and happiness.</t5503>
<t5504>As they approached Barton, she fell silent and pensive, entering familiar places where every field and tree sometimes evoked sweet, sometimes bitter memories; she turned her face away from their eyes and sat looking out the window.</t5504> <t5505>But now Elinor could neither be surprised nor angry; when she saw Marianne crying as she helped her out of the carriage, she thought that her state of mind was so natural and unexaggerated that it was commendable, and she could feel nothing less than compassion.</t5505> <t5506>In all her subsequent actions, she saw a determined effort to be sensible; they had just entered the sitting rooms when Marianne, with a firm stance, let her eyes roam around the room as if determined to immediately accustom herself to every object that might be associated with Willoughby's memories.</t5506> <t5507>-She spoke little, but every word was aimed at being cheerful; even if she sometimes sighed unconsciously, she never failed to compensate with a smile.</t5507> <t5508>After dinner, she tried the piano.</t5508> <t5509>She sat down, but the first music she saw was an opera that Willoughby had bought, containing duets they loved, and on the cover page was her name written in Willoughby's handwriting.</t5509> <t5510>-This would not do.</t5510> <t5511>-She shook her head, set the music aside, and after letting her fingers wander over the keys for a minute or two, she complained about the weakness of her fingers and closed the piano again; but as she closed it, she said with conviction that she needed to practice a lot in the future.</t5511>
<t5512>The next morning did not bring any decrease in these encouraging signs.</t5512> <t5513>On the contrary, with a spirit and body strengthened by rest, he acted even more cheerfully, spoke even more cheerfully, eagerly awaited Margaret's return, and spoke of the family unity, shared struggles, and joyful companionship that would return to their former state as the only happiness worth wishing for.</t5513>
<t5514>"When the weather improves and I regain my health," he said, "we will go for long walks together every day.</t5514> <t5515>We will walk to the farm at the end of the slope, see what the children are doing; walk to Sir John's new fields at Barton Junction, then to Abbeyland; often go to the old Priory ruins and try to trace the foundations to the place they say was once visited.</t5515> <t5516>I know we will be happy.</t5516> <t5517>I know the summer will be happy.</t5517> <t5518>I intend to wake up no later than six, and from that hour until dinner time, I will dedicate every moment to music and reading.</t5518> <t5519>I have made my plan, and I am determined to start serious study.</t5519> <t5520>I know our library well, it can no longer offer me anything other than entertainment.</t5520> <t5521>But there are many books worth reading in the Park; there are even more modern books I can borrow from Colonel Brandon.</t5521> <t5522>By reading only six hours a day, I will gain the great education I now lack within twelve months.</t5522><t5523>"</t5523>
<t5524>Elinor praised her for the plan that arose from such a noble cause; she smiled when she saw that the same eager imagination, which had led her to excessive laziness and selfish dissatisfaction, was now active again and adding an excess of sensible occupation and virtuous sobriety to the plan.</t5524> <t5525>But she remembered that she had not yet fulfilled the promise she made to Willoughby and feared that she would tell Marianne things that could again disturb her balance, at least for a while, and upset her hopes of occupied tranquility, and her smile turned into a sigh.</t5525> <t5526>With the desire to postpone that ominous moment, she decided to wait until her sister's health was fully restored.</t5526> <t5527>However, this decision would not be long-lasting.</t5527>
<t5528>Marianne stayed at home for two or three days until she felt well enough to venture outside, like someone with her condition would.</t5528> <t5529>But finally, there came a soft, calm morning that encouraged the girl's desires and the mother's courage; leaning on Elinor's arm, Marianne received permission to walk as far as she could without getting tired on the path in front of the house.</t5529>
<t5530>The sisters began to walk with steps as slow as Marianne's weakness required, an exercise she had not tried since her illness; - they had only gone far enough from the house to get a full view of the hill, the significant hill at the back, when Marianne, turning her eyes to the hill and pausing, calmly said,</t5530>
<t5531>"Right there, exactly there" -pointing with one hand, "on that bump; -that's where I fell; that's where I first saw Willoughby.</t5531><t5532>"</t5532>
<t5533>The conversation died out with that word, but immediately revived as he added,</t5533>
<t5534>"I am grateful that I can look at that point without suffering!"</t5534> <t5535>"-are we ever going to talk about that, Elinor?" -she said this hesitantly.</t5535> <t5536>"-Or would it be wrong?"</t5536> <t5537>"-I think I can speak properly now."</t5537>
<t5538>Elinor warmly invited him to be open.</t5538>
<t5539>"Regarding him," said Marianne, "I no longer feel sorrow.</t5539> <t5540>I will not tell you what I had felt for him; I will tell you what I feel for him now.</t5540> <t5541>-At this moment, if I could be sure of one thing, if I could believe that he wasn't pretending from the beginning to the end, that he wasn't deceiving me from the beginning to the end; -but most importantly, that he wasn't as despicable as I sometimes thought, especially after that unfortunate girl's story-"</t5541>
<t5542>He paused.</t5542> <t5543>-Elinor, while responding, joyfully appreciated his words.</t5543>
<t5544>"If you could be sure of this, you would feel at ease."</t5544><t5545>"</t5545>
<t5546>"Yes.</t5546> <t5547>My inner peace depends on this in two ways; -because on one hand, it is terrible to suspect someone who has been so important to me because of such plans, -but on the other hand</t5547>
<t5548>what would I think of myself?</t5548> <t5549>-In a situation like mine, what could an excessively shameful love expose me to? "Then," asked her sister, "how do you explain your behavior?</t5549><t5550>"</t5550>
<t5551>"If you ask me -oh, if it were up to me, it would be so easy, just fickle, very, very fickle.</t5551><t5552>"</t5552>
<t5553>Elinor didn't say anything else.</t5553> <t5554>She was debating within herself whether it would be appropriate to start her story immediately or to wait until Marianne's health improved significantly; -they walked slowly and silently for a few minutes.</t5554>
<t5555>"I cannot wish good things for him," Marianne said at last, sighing, "as long as his hidden thoughts are not more unpleasant than mine.</t5555> <t5556>He will suffer enough within them.</t5556><t5557>"</t5557>
<t5558>"Are you comparing your behavior with his/hers?"</t5558><t5559>"</t5559>
<t5560>"No.</t5560> <t5561>I'm comparing it to what it should be; I'm comparing it to yours.</t5561><t5562>"</t5562>
<t5563>"Our situations were not very similar to each other.</t5563><t5564>"</t5564>
<t5565>"It wasn't just our behaviors that were similar.</t5565> <t5566>-Let not the refinement defend what the mind condemns, dear Elinon. My illness made me think -it gave me time and tranquility to think seriously.</t5566> <t5567>Long before I was well enough to speak, I was well enough to think.</t5567> <t5568>I thought about the past; since the beginning of my acquaintance with him last autumn, I saw nothing in my behavior but a series of imprudence towards myself and rudeness towards others.</t5568> <t5569>I saw that my own feelings had prepared my own sufferings, and my fragility in the face of pain had nearly brought me to the grave.</t5569> <t5570>I realized that I had entirely brought my illness upon myself, because I had neglected my own health, which I felt was wrong even at that time.</t5570> <t5571>If I had died, -I would have taken my own life.</t5571> <t5572>I did not know the magnitude of the danger until the danger had passed; but the thoughts these gave me</t5572>
<t5573>I am amazed at my recovery with emotions, -I am amazed at how the greatness of my desire to live, so that I might have the opportunity to make peace with my God and you all, did not kill me immediately.</t5573> <t5574>If I had died, -I would have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister in such heavy misery!</t5574> <t5575>-You who saw all the detestable selfishness of my last days; you who listened to all the murmurs of my heart!</t5575> <t5576>-How would I have lived in your memory!</t5576> <t5577>-And my mother! How could you have consoled her!</t5577> <t5578>-I cannot express how much I despise myself.</t5578> <t5579>-Whenever I look back, I see a duty neglected or a lapse into weakness.</t5579> <t5580>I feel as if I have hurt everyone.</t5580> <t5581>I responded to Mrs. Jennings' kindness, her unconditional kindness, with ungrateful disdain.</t5581> <t5582>I was rude and unjust to the Middletons, the Palmers, the Steeles, even to our most ordinary acquaintance, with a heart hardened against their virtues, a soul disturbed by their interest.</t5582> <t5583>-To John, to Fanny, -yes, even to them, though they hardly deserved it, I gave less than they deserved.</t5583> <t5584>But you, -most of all you, more than my mother, you suffered the worst treatment from me.</t5584> <t5585>Only I knew your heart and your sorrow; but did it affect me?</t5585> <t5586>-It did not arouse any feeling of compassion that would benefit you or me.</t5586> <t5587>-Your example was before me: but what good did it do?</t5587> <t5588>-Did I show more sensitivity for you and your happiness?</t5588> <t5589>Did I imitate your fortitude or lighten your burden by sharing those daily duties or special obligations that you have been left to fulfill alone until now?</t5589> <t5590>-No -even when I knew you were unhappy, I did not do it, just as I did not do it when I believed you were comfortable; I avoided every kind of duty or effort of friendship; I allowed no one but myself the right to grieve, I mourned only for that heart that abandoned me, that deceived me, and I left you, whom I loved boundlessly, to be miserable because of me.</t5590><t5591>"</t5591>
<t5592>The rapid flow of his self-critical mind was interrupted here; although he was too honest to flatter himself, he sought to soothe it</t5592>
<t5593>Elinor, who was eagerly waiting, immediately gave her the praise and support that her sincerity and remorse richly deserved.</t5593> <t5594>Marianne squeezed her hand and said,</t5594>
<t5595>"You are very good.</t5595> <t5596>-You will be my proof in the future.</t5596> <t5597>I have made my plan and if I can manage to implement it - I will control my emotions, develop my personality.</t5597> <t5598>I will no longer hurt others, nor will I torture myself.</t5598> <t5599>From now on, I will live only for my family.</t5599> <t5600>You, my mother, and Margaret will be my whole world; you will share my love completely among yourselves.</t5600> <t5601>I will never again feel the slightest urge to leave you, my home; if I mingle with other people, it will only be to show that I am now humble, that my soul has healed, that I can fulfill the requirements of civilization and the small duties of life with kindness and fortitude.</t5601> <t5602>As for Willoughby, -it would be futile to say that I will soon forget him or that I will never forget him.</t5602> <t5603>His memory cannot be erased by changing circumstances or thoughts.</t5603> <t5604>But it will be managed and restrained according to the requirements of religion, reason, and constant occupation.</t5604><t5605>"</t5605>
<t5606>He paused - and added in a lower voice, "If I could know his true condition, everything would be easier.</t5606><t5607>"</t5607>
<t5608>Elinor, who had been contemplating for a while whether it was appropriate to quickly tell her story and couldn't decide either way, realized upon hearing this that hesitating was pointless and that she needed to be decisive, thus finding herself telling the truth.</t5608>
<t5609>He told the story as he hoped, in a proper manner; he carefully prepared his curious listener; he simply and honestly explained the main points on which Willoughby based his apology; he acknowledged his remorse and only softened his expressions of dissatisfaction with his current situation.</t5609> <t5610>Marianne did not say a word.</t5610> <t5611>-She trembled, her eyes fixed on the ground, her lips turned whiter than the illness had left them.</t5611> <t5612>Thousands of questions arose within her, but she did not dare to bring any of them up.</t5612> <t5613>She caught every syllable with breathless curiosity; her hand unconsciously squeezed her sister's hand, and her cheeks were covered with tears.</t5613>
<t5614>Fearing that she might be getting tired, Elinor directed her home; until they reached the cottage door, though she did not attempt to ask any questions, she could easily guess how curious she must be and spoke only of Willoughby and her meeting with him; she meticulously attended to every detail of her words and appearance, where meticulousness in detail was harmless.</t5614> <t5615>As soon as they entered the house, Marianne parted from her sister with a kiss of gratitude and the barely uttered words through her tears, "Tell my mother," and slowly went upstairs.</t5615> <t5616>Elinor did not attempt to disturb the reasonable solitude she now needed; trying to preemptively manage the outcome with concern, she decided to bring up the subject again if Marianne neglected it, and headed to the sitting room to fulfill her promise made at the moment of departure.</t5616>
<t5617>Mrs. Dashwood listened emotionally to the defense of her former favorite.</t5617> <t5618>She was glad that he was cleared of part of the charge attributed to him; -she felt sorry for him; -she wished him happiness.</t5618> <t5619>But the feelings of the past were not returning.</t5619> <t5620>Nothing could reunite him with Marianne with an unbroken trust -with an unblemished character.</t5620> <t5621>Nothing could make her forget what Marianne suffered because of him, nor lessen his guilt in his behavior towards Eliza.</t5621> <t5622>Nothing could restore him to his former place in her eyes, nor tarnish Colonel Brandon's reputation.</t5622>
<t5623>If Mrs. Dashwood had heard Willoughby's story from him directly - had witnessed his distress, been influenced by his face and demeanor, her pity would probably have been greater.</t5623> <t5624>But it was neither within Elinor's power nor her inclination to evoke in another the feelings that had been awakened in herself through indirect narration.</t5624> <t5625>Reflection had given calmness to her judgments, making her views on Willoughby's deservingness more sober; -therefore, she only wanted to state the simple truth, revealing the details truly fitting his character without adding any emotional embellishments that could captivate the imagination.</t5625>
<t5626>In the evening, when they all gathered together, Marianne started talking about him again of her own accord; -but it was clear that she found it difficult to do so from the uneasy, restless distraction that had been sitting within her for some time -her blushing face as she spoke -and her trembling voice.</t5626>
<t5627>"I want you to be sure," he said, "I see everything just as you want me to see it.</t5627><t5628>"</t5628>
<t5629>Mrs. Dashwood was about to silence her with all the tenderness she could muster, but Elinor, who truly wanted to hear her sister's impartial opinion, stopped her with a persistent gesture.</t5629> <t5630>Marianne continued slowly-</t5630>
<t5631>"It relieved me greatly - what Elinor told me this morning - I heard exactly what I wanted to hear."</t5631> <t5632>-For a few seconds, her voice faded; but she composed herself and added with even greater calmness -"I am now extremely satisfied.</t5632> <t5633>I wouldn't want anything to be different.</t5633> <t5634>After learning all this, which I would have eventually learned anyway, I could never have been happy with him.</t5634> <t5635>-I couldn't trust or respect him.</t5635> <t5636>-Nothing could make me forget these things."</t5636><t5637>"</t5637>
<t5638>"I know - I know," cried her mother.</t5638> <t5639>"Can one be happy with a man who leads a dissolute life!</t5639> <t5640>-Someone who has devastated our dearest friend, the best person in the world!</t5640> <t5641>-No - my Marianne's heart could never be made happy by such a man!</t5641> <t5642>All the remorse her husband should have felt, her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would feel.</t5642><t5643>"</t5643>
<t5644>Marianne sighed and repeated, "I wouldn't want anything to be different.</t5644><t5645>"</t5645>
<t5646>"The matter," said Elinor, "you are thinking about it exactly as a healthy mind and sound intellect should; I suppose you see as clearly as I do that, not only in this event but in many other situations, your marriage would bring you a lot of trouble and distress, and there is enough reason to believe that his love would not be enough to keep you standing then.</t5646> <t5647>If you had married, you would always have been poor.</t5647> <t5648>He himself admits his frivolity; every action of his shows that moderation is an unknown word to him.</t5648> <t5649>With a small, very small income, his demands and your inexperience combined would have caused you troubles you had never known before, and not thinking about them would not make them any less painful.</t5649> <t5650>Your sense of honor and integrity, I know, would lead you to economize in every possible way when you realized your situation; thriftiness might be reasonable only as long as you sacrificed your own comfort, but beyond that - even if you managed alone, what good would it do to stop a bankruptcy that had started before you married?</t5650> <t5651>Beyond that, if you tried to cut back on his pleasures a little, wouldn't it be necessary to fear the diminishing effect on his heart and his regret for the marriage that brought him into these troubles, rather than convincing his selfish feelings that couldn't accept it?</t5651><t5652>"</t5652>
<t5653>Marianne's lips trembled and, in a voice trying to say "do you really think I'm selfish?" she repeated the word "Selfish?"</t5653>
<t5654>"From start to finish," replied Elinor, "his entire behavior was based on selfishness.</t5654> <t5655>First, playing with your feelings was due to his selfishness; then, when he fell in love, he delayed his confession for the same reason, and finally, he left Barton.</t5655> <t5656>His own pleasure, his own comfort was his fundamental principle in every detail.</t5656><t5657>"</t5657>
<t5658>"That's true.</t5658> <t5659>He never cared about my happiness.</t5659><t5660>"</t5660>
<t5661>"And now," continued Elinor, "he regrets what he did.</t5661> <t5662>So why does he regret it?</t5662> <t5663>-Because he saw that he didn't find what he expected.</t5663> <t5664>This did not make him happy.</t5664> <t5665>Now his circumstances are comfortable - he doesn't have that kind of trouble; he just thinks he married a woman less charming than you.</t5665> <t5666>But does this mean he would have been happy if he had married you?</t5666> <t5667>-The discomforts would just be different.</t5667> <t5668>Then he would have suffered from financial difficulties, but now that he doesn't have financial difficulties, he acts as if it's not important.</t5668> <t5669>He would have had a wife whose personality he wouldn't complain about, but he would always be short of money - he would always be poor and probably would have quickly learned to value the countless privileges of a clean fortune and a good income over the happiness at home, over his wife's personality.</t5669><t5670>"</t5670>
<t5671>"I have no doubt about that," said Marianne; "there is nothing I am upset about - except my own foolishness.</t5671><t5672>"</t5672>
<t5673>"More likely, it was your mother's carelessness, my dear," said Mrs. Dashwood; "your mother needs to be accountable.</t5673><t5674>"</t5674>
<t5675>Marianne did not allow it to continue; -seeing that both of them had recognized their own mistakes, Elinor wanted to avoid any retrospection that might upset her sister; so she immediately returned to the initial topic and continued speaking,</t5675>
<t5676>"From the whole story, I believe, only one conclusion can be drawn - all of Willoughby's troubles stem from the dishonorable act he committed in his treatment of Eliza Williams.</t5676> <t5677>This act became the source of smaller other offenses and his current unhappiness.</t5677><t5678>"</t5678>
<t5679>Marianne sincerely agreed with this view; her mother took the conversation from there to the identification of Colonel Brandon's sufferings and virtues, with a warmth created hand in hand by friendship and planning.</t5679> <t5680>However, her daughter did not seem to have heard most of what she said.</t5680>
<t5681>Contrary to what Elinor had hoped, she saw that Marianne did not continue to regain her strength as before in the next two or three days; but since her determination did not wane and she still tried to appear cheerful and at ease, her sister could continue to trust in the effect of time on her health.</t5681>
<t5682>Margaret returned, and the whole family reunited and settled back into the cabin calmly; although they did not engage in their usual tasks with the same enthusiasm as when they first came to Barton, they at least made plans to do so with greater effort in the future.</t5682>
<t5683>Elinor was eager to hear from Edward.</t5683> <t5684>Since he had left London, she had heard nothing about him, neither anything new about his plans nor about his current home.</t5684> <t5685>Due to Marianne's illness, she had corresponded with her brother; in John's first letter, there was a sentence: -"We know nothing about unfortunate Edward, we can't ask questions about such a forbidden subject, but we still guess he's in Oxford;" this was all she could learn about Edward from the letters; in the subsequent letters, his name wasn't even mentioned.</t5685> <t5686>However, Elinor was not destined to remain ignorant of his doings for long.</t5686>
<t5687>One morning, they had sent their servants to Exeter for work; while the servant, standing by the table, was answering his mistress's questions about the journey, he spontaneously added-</t5687>
<t5688>"You have probably heard, madam, IvL ı'errars has gotten married.</t5688><t5689>"</t5689>
<t5690>Marianne suddenly jolted, fixed her eyes on Elinor, saw that she had turned pale, and collapsed into her chair in a fit of hysteria.</t5690> <t5691>Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes had instinctively turned in the same direction while answering the servant's question, was shaken when she saw how much pain Elinor was in, then surprised by Marianne's condition, and didn't know which child to attend to first.</t5691>
<t5692>Only the servant who saw Miss Marianne fall ill acted wisely and called one of the maids; with Mrs. Dashwood's help, the maid took her by the arm and led her to the other room.</t5692> <t5693>By that time, Marianne had somewhat recovered, and her mother entrusted her to Margaret and the maid, then turned to Elinor; although Elinor was still in disarray, she had recovered enough to use her mind and voice, and had begun questioning Thomas about the source of the information.</t5693> <t5694>Mrs. Dashwood immediately took on the whole task, and Elinor enjoyed the relief of getting answers without the fatigue of asking questions.</t5694>
<t5695>"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars got married, Thomas?"</t5695>
<t5696>"This morning in Exeter, I saw Mr. Ferrars myself, sir, and even his wife, Miss Steele, that is.</t5696> <t5697>They were in a carriage at the door of the New Lincoln Inn, and I had gone there to deliver a message from Sally in the Park to the postman.</t5697> <t5698>As I was passing by the carriage, I looked up, and what did I see but little Miss Steele; I tipped my hat again, she recognized me, called out to me, asked about you and the young ladies, sir, especially Miss Marianne, and asked me to convey their most sincere regards to you from herself and Mr. Ferrars. They were sorry they couldn't come to see you because they were in a great hurry, as they had some more traveling to do, but they said they would certainly come to see you when they returned.</t5698><t5699>"</t5699>
<t5700>"But did he tell you that he got married, Thomas?"</t5700><t5701>"</t5701>
<t5702>"Yes, sir.</t5702> <t5703>She smiled and said that she had changed her name since she last came here.</t5703> <t5704>She has always been a very warm and straightforward young lady and has behaved very civilly.</t5704> <t5705>Therefore, I felt entitled to wish her happiness.</t5705><t5706>"</t5706>
<t5707>"Was Mr. Ferrars in the car with her?"</t5707><t5708>"</t5708>
<t5709>"Yes sir, I saw him as he leaned back, but he didn't lift his head; -he was never a very talkative gentleman anyway."</t5709><t5710>"</t5710>
<t5711>Elinor could understand why she did not put herself forward; Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.</t5711>
<t5712>"Wasn't there anyone else in the car?"</t5712><t5713>"</t5713>
<t5714>"No sir, only two of them."</t5714><t5715>"</t5715>
<t5716>"Do you know where they came from?</t5716><t5717>"</t5717>
<t5718>"They are coming directly from the city, Miss Lucy - that is what Mrs. Ferrars said.</t5718><t5719>"</t5719>
<t5720>"Are they going quite far to the west?"</t5720><t5721>"</t5721>
<t5722>"Yes sir - but they won't stay long."</t5722> <t5723>"They will return soon, then of course they will stop by here."</t5723><t5724>"</t5724>
<t5725>Mrs. Dashwood looked at her daughter; but Elinor was in a better state than they had expected.</t5725> <t5726>She identified the real Lucy in the message; she knew that Edward would never come to them again.</t5726> <t5727>In a low voice, she told her mother that they had probably gone to the vicinity of Plymouth, to Mr. Pratt's place.</t5727>
<t5728>It seemed as though Thomas had run out of intelligence.</t5728> <t5729>Elinor looked as if she wanted to hear more.</t5729>
<t5730>"Did you see them leave before you came?"</t5730><t5731>"</t5731>
<t5732>"No, sir - the horses were just coming out, but I couldn't stay any longer; I was afraid of being late.</t5732><t5733>"</t5733>
<t5734>"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?"</t5734><t5735>"</t5735>
<t5736>"Yes sir, she said she was very well; I also think she has always been a very beautiful young lady - and she looked quite happy."</t5736><t5737>"</t5737>
<t5738>Mrs. Dashwood had no other questions in mind, and now Thomas, who was equally unnecessary, was also taken out along with the tablecloth.</t5738> <t5739>Marianne announced that she would not eat any more; Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor had also lost their appetites; Margaret, however, could consider herself lucky, because although her sisters had recently gone through so much discomfort and had so many reasons to disregard food, she had never before had to leave the table without eating.</t5739>
<t5740>When dessert and wine were brought, and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left alone, they sat together for a long time in the same thoughtful silence.</t5740> <t5741>Mrs. Dashwood hesitated to say anything, she did not attempt to console her.</t5741> <t5742>She now realized that she had been mistaken in trusting Elinor's outward appearance; she noticed that everything had been softened openly at the time so that Elinor would not be more unhappy, and so that she would not suffer for her after Marianne.</t5742> <t5743>She saw that she had been misled into thinking that the relationship she once understood so well was in reality much weaker than she wanted to believe or than it now appeared, by her daughter's careful, meticulous attention.</t5743> <t5744>She feared that in this belief she had acted unfairly, carelessly, even rudely towards Elinor; that Marianne's troubles, being more spoken of and more apparent, had received much of her compassion, and that she had forgotten that in Elinor she had a daughter who suffered just as much but was less demonstrative and much more composed.</t5744>
<t5745>Elinor now knew the difference between the expectation of a distressing event, no matter how much reason might say otherwise, and its actual occurrence.</t5745> <t5746>Unwillingly, she had always hoped that as long as Edward remained single, something would prevent him from marrying Lucy—perhaps his own decision, perhaps the intervention of his relatives, or perhaps the emergence of a more advantageous marriage opportunity for the lady, something that would make everyone happy.</t5746> <t5747>But now he was married, and Elinor was angry with herself for that insidious optimism that had only increased her pain.</t5747>
<t5748>He was initially a bit surprised that she got married so quickly without obtaining the authorization certificate (according to his estimation) and therefore without being appointed to the church.</t5748> <t5749>But soon he realized how possible it was for Lucy to have managed everything without risking any delay, thanks to her skillful management and her hurry to get the signature.</t5749> <t5750>They got married in the city, and now they are hastily going to her uncle's place.</t5750> <t5751>What must Edward have felt when he saw his mother's servant and heard Lucy's message as they passed within four miles of Barton!</t5751>
<t5752>He hoped they would soon settle in Delaford.</t5752> <t5753>-Delaford, -the place for which many plans had been made to interest him; a place he both wanted to know and avoid.</t5753> <t5754>For a moment, he saw them in the parsonage; he saw Lucy as the active, managing director, combining thrift with the desire to look elegant, but being doubted because of half of her financial dealings.</t5754>
<t5755>He is embarrassed; -his mind is always in pursuit of gain, making tricks to get into the good graces of Colonel Brandon, Mrs. Jennings, and every wealthy acquaintance.</t5755> <t5756>As for Edward, -he didn't know what he saw or what he wanted to see; -whether he was happy or unhappy, —nothing pleased him; -he rejected every kind of picture of him.</t5756>
<t5757>Elinor occupied herself with the thought that one of their acquaintances in London would write to them and inform them of the event, detailing everything; but days passed, and no letter came, no news.</t5757> <t5758>Unable to decide whom to blame, she blamed every negligent acquaintance.</t5758> <t5759>They were all thoughtless and lazy.</t5759>
<t5760>"When are you going to write to Colonel Brandon, mom?" he asked, because he was impatient for something to happen.</t5760>
<t5761>"I wrote last week, my dear; rather than hearing from him, I hope to see him.</t5761> <t5762>In my letter, I insisted that he should come to us; don't be surprised if he walks in any day now.</t5762><t5763>"</t5763>
<t5764>This was a gain, there was something to wait for.</t5764> <t5765>Colonel Brandon must have had news to give.</t5765>
<t5766>She had just made up her mind when the sight of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window.</t5766> <t5767>The man stopped at their door.</t5767> <t5768>He was a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.</t5768> <t5769>She would learn more now; -she trembled with this expectation.</t5769> <t5770>But -it was not Colonel Brandon -he did not have his demeanor -he was not of his height.</t5770> <t5771>If it were possible, she would say it had to be Edward.</t5771> <t5772>She looked again.</t5772> <t5773>The man had just dismounted; -she could not be mistaken; -it was Edward.</t5773> <t5774>Elinor moved away from the window and sat down.</t5774> <t5775>"Mr. Pratt is coming to see us from there.</t5775> <t5776>I will be calm; I will control myself.</t5776><t5777>"</t5777>
<t5778>He realized a moment later that the others had also noticed the mistake in the same way.</t5778> <t5779>He saw that his mother and Marianne had changed colors; he saw that they were looking at him and whispering a few sentences to each other.</t5779> <t5780>He would give the world to speak - to make them understand that he hoped no coldness, no anger would be seen in their behavior towards him; - but he couldn't open his mouth and had to leave everyone to their own devices.</t5780>
<t5781>Not a single word was spoken loudly.</t5781> <t5782>They all waited silently for their guest to appear.</t5782> <t5783>Footsteps were heard along the gravel path; soon they were in the hall; and a moment later, they were in front of them.</t5783>
<t5784>His gaze was not very happy as he entered the room, not even for Elinor.</t5784> <t5785>His face was pale with excitement and he seemed to be afraid of how he would be received, knowing that he did not deserve a kind reception.</t5785> <t5786>Nevertheless, Mrs. Dashwood, acting in accordance with the wishes of her daughter, whose guidance she now trusted in all matters, greeted him with a reluctant satisfaction, extended her hand, and wished him happiness.</t5786>
<t5787>Edward blushed deeply and mumbled an incomprehensible response.</t5787> <t5788>Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and when the moment of motion ended, she wished she had shaken hands with him as well.</t5788> <t5789>But now it was too late, and with a positive expression, she sat down again and began to talk about the weather.</t5789>
<t5790>Marianne had withdrawn as far out of sight as possible to hide her discontent; Margaret, who understood at least part of the situation if not all of it, grasped that she needed to be composed, so she sat as far away from her as possible and remained tightly silent.</t5790>
<t5791>When Elinor finished expressing her happiness about the rainless season, there was a dreadful silence.</t5791> <t5792>The silence was broken by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt compelled to hope that Mrs. Ferrars had been in good health when they parted.</t5792> <t5793>Edward responded affirmatively with a hasty manner.</t5793>
<t5794>There was another silence.</t5794>
<t5795>Deciding to push herself, Elinor, despite being afraid of the sound of her own voice, said,</t5795>
<t5796>"Is Mrs. Ferrars in Longstaple?"</t5796><t5797>"</t5797>
<t5798>"Longstaple!" - replied Edward, surprised - "No, my mother is in the city.</t5798><t5799>"</t5799>
<t5800>"Well," said Elinor, taking a piece of needlework from the table, "I wanted to ask about Mrs. Edward Ferrars.</t5800><t5801>"</t5801>
<t5802>Elinor did not dare to lift her head; -but both her mother and Marianne turned their eyes towards her.</t5802> <t5803>Edward's color changed, he looked confused, glanced uncertainly, and after a little hesitation, he said,</t5803>
<t5804>"Maybe you mean - my sister - I mean Mrs - Mrs. Robert Ferrars."</t5804><t5805>"</t5805>
<t5806>"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!" - repeated by Marianne and her mother, with an emphasis of tremendous astonishment; - Elinor, though unable to speak, fixed her eyes on him in impatient wonder.</t5806> <t5807>Edward rose from his chair and walked to the window, probably because he did not know what else to do; he picked up a pair of scissors lying there and, while cutting the sheath of the scissors, said in a hurried voice,</t5807>
<t5808>"Perhaps you know -you might not have heard, my brother recently -got married to -Miss Lucy Steele."</t5808><t5809>"</t5809>
<t5810>Her words echoed with an indescribable expression of astonishment from everyone except Elinor; Elinor, who was sitting with her head bent over her work, was so overwhelmed with excitement that she no longer knew where she was.</t5810>
<t5811>"Yes," said Edward, "they got married last week, and now they are in Dawlish.</t5811><t5812>"</t5812>
<t5813>Elinor could not sit any longer.</t5813> <t5814>She almost ran out of the room and burst into tears of joy that she thought would never end as soon as the door closed.</t5814> <t5815>Edward, who until that moment had looked everywhere but at her, saw her rush out, perhaps even saw - or heard - her excitement; for he immediately fell into such a reverie that none of Mrs. Dashwood's words, questions, or kind addresses could reach him; finally, he left the room without a word and walked towards the village, leaving the others in a state of tremendous astonishment and confusion about such a sudden and wonderful change in his situation, with no means to resolve this confusion other than their own guesses.</t5815>
<t5816>Although the conditions of his release remained a mystery to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was now free; and it was easily predictable by everyone how this freedom would be used; -because after experiencing and failing in a foolish relationship that he had entered into without his mother's approval and had been maintaining for more than four years, nothing less could be expected from him than to immediately enter into another such relationship.</t5816>
<t5817>Barton's visit was actually a simple one.</t5817> <t5818>It was only to propose to Elinor; considering he could hardly be called inexperienced in making such proposals, it might seem strange that he was so uneasy at the time, needing courage and fresh air and such.</t5818>
<t5819>How quickly he reached the necessary determination by walking, how quickly the opportunity to put this determination into action arose, and in what way he expressed himself, how it was received, there is no need to elaborate on these at length.</t5819> <t5820>Only this needs to be told; -about three hours after his arrival, when they all sat down to eat together, he had convinced his wife, obtained permission from his mother, and was not only drunk with love but also justifiably and officially one of the happiest men in the world.</t5820> <t5821>His situation was truly filled with extraordinary joy.</t5821> <t5822>He felt much more than the ordinary victory of love that would bring happiness to his heart and joy to his soul.</t5822> <t5823>That had long made him miserable</t5823>
<t5824>He had freed himself from a relationship with a woman he had not loved for a long time, without any fault of his own, and had regained his freedom; -and as soon as he began to think with desire, he had been forced to think with despair about another woman with whom he had reached that level of commitment.</t5824> <t5825>This happiness had come not from doubt or indecision, but from wretchedness; -and the change was clearly expressed in a genuine, flowing, mature cheerfulness that his friends had never seen in him before.</t5825>
<t5826>His heart was now open to Elinor, all his weaknesses, all his faults confessed, and his initial youthful attachment to Lucy considered with the philosophical calmness of a twenty-four-year-old.</t5826>
<t5827>"From my perspective, it was a foolish, silly inclination," he said, "a result of not knowing the world - a lack of occupation.</t5827> <t5828>If my mother had given me an active profession when I came out of Mr. Pratt's supervision at eighteen, surely - no, I'm certain, none of this would have happened; even if I had left Longstaple with the interest I felt for my niece, which I then thought was indispensable, if I had a pursuit, a goal to dedicate my time to and keep me away from it for a few months, I would have quickly forgotten that imaginary love, especially if I had been more involved in life, which I should have done in that situation.</t5828> <t5829>But instead of having something to do, instead of a profession being chosen for me or being given the permission to choose, I returned home to complete idleness; during the first twelve months, I didn't even have the normal occupation that belonging to a university would give me, because I wasn't sent to Oxford until I was nineteen.</t5829> <t5830>So I had nothing to do in life, except to think I was in love; since my mother didn't make my home comfortable, my brother wasn't a friend or companion to me, and I didn't like meeting new people, it wasn't unusual for me to go to Longstaple often; I felt at home there and knew I would always be well received; thus, I spent most of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy seemed extremely charming and kind.</t5830> <t5831>She was also beautiful - at least it seemed so then; since I hadn't seen many other women, I couldn't make comparisons or see flaws.</t5831> <t5832>All things considered, I hope that, even though it was a foolish relationship, and has since proven to be foolish in every way, it wasn't an extraordinary or unforgivable example of foolishness at that time.</t5832><t5833>"</t5833>
<t5834>The change that a few hours had wrought in the minds and happiness of the Dashwoods was such - so great that it promised them the joy of a sleepless night.</t5834> <t5835>Mrs. Dashwood, who was so happy that she couldn't stay still, didn't know how to show her love to Edward, how to praise Elinor, how to be thankful that Edward was freed without damaging his reputation, how to leave them alone to talk comfortably, but at the same time, how not to miss the pleasure of watching them to her heart's content.</t5835>
<t5836>Marianne could only express her happiness through tears.</t5836> <t5837>Comparisons were made - sorrows emerged; her joy, as genuine as her love for her sister, was not the kind that would make her cheerful or talkative.</t5837>
<t5838>Aunt Elinor - How should her feelings be described?</t5838> <t5839>-From the moment she heard that Lucy had married someone else and that Edward was free, to the moment when the hopes that immediately followed that moment were justified, she experienced every state except calmness.</t5839> <t5840>But when the second moment passed, when she realized that every doubt and every worry had disappeared, she compared her situation to her recent state, -she saw that she had respectfully freed herself from her old relationship, that she was free, that she immediately took advantage of this freedom, that he approached her and proposed marriage with a love as delicate and strong as she had always imagined, -she was overwhelmed with happiness; -although the human mind is ready to easily accept positive changes, it took a few hours for her soul to calm down and for a certain tranquility to settle in.</t5840>
<t5841>It was decided that Edward would stay in the cabin for at least a week; -anything could be asked of him, but it was impossible to give him less than a week to catch up with Elinor or to talk about even half of the things related to the past, present, and future; -even if just a few hours of diligent and continuous conversation between two sensible people would require more topics than what could truly be shared, the situation is different with lovers.</t5841> <t5842>Between them, no topic is ever finished, and no agreement is ever reached without discussing the same thing at least twenty times over from the beginning.</t5842>
<t5843>Among these, the most endless and reasonable subject of wonder was, of course, Lucy's marriage, which constituted one of the first conversations of the lovers; -the fact that Elinor knew both parties allowed her to see the matter from every angle as one of the most extraordinary and inexplicable events she had ever heard.</t5843> <t5844>How did they come together; by what attraction did Robert entertain the thought of marrying a girl he said he did not find beautiful, -and a girl who was engaged to his brother, who was the reason for his brother being cast out from his family, -was beyond her comprehension.</t5844> <t5845>It was certainly a joyous event for her, a ridiculous event for her imagination, but a complete puzzle for her mind and common sense.</t5845>
<t5846>Edward could only make a guess; perhaps they had met by chance, one’s pride had so believed the other’s compliments that the rest had gradually followed.</t5846> <t5847>Elinor remembered Robert's opinion, which he had told her on Harley Street, about what his brother’s timely interference could achieve.</t5847> <t5848>She told this to Edward.</t5848>
<t5849>"That's something one would expect from Robert," was Edward's first reaction.</t5849> <t5850>"Maybe," he added afterwards, "he had this in mind when they first met.</t5850> <t5851>Lucy might have initially thought of making him useful to me.</t5851> <t5852>Other plans might have emerged later.</t5852><t5853>"</t5853>
<t5854>He couldn't figure out how long their relationship had been going on; after leaving London, he couldn't get any news about Lucy in Oxford, where he preferred to stay, except for what she herself told him; until the last one, the frequency of her letters had neither decreased nor had their usual warmth.</t5854> <t5855>Not the slightest suspicion had arisen to prepare him for what was to come; -when the incident finally broke out with a letter from Lucy, he thought he had been half-stunned for a while, caught between the amazement, horror, and joy of such a release.</t5855> <t5856>He handed the letter to Elinor.</t5856>
<t5857>"Dear Sir,</t5857>
<t5858>Since I was sure for a long time that I had lost your love, I felt free to give my own love to someone else; I have no doubt that I will be as happy with him as I once thought I could be with you; but I do not find it appropriate to accept a marriage proposal while my heart belongs to another.</t5858> <t5859>I sincerely wish you happiness in your choice; if we cannot remain good friends as our close kinship requires, it will not be my fault; I can comfortably say that I hold no grudge against you and I am sure you are too noble to do us any harm.</t5859> <t5860>Your brother has won all my love; since we cannot live without each other, we have just returned from the priest's presence and set off for Dawlish for a few weeks; your dear brother is very curious about that place, but first he deemed it appropriate to trouble you with a few lines,</t5860>
<t5861>Your always well-wisher, friend, and sister-in-law, Lucy Ferrars</t5861>
<t5862>I burned all your letters, and I will send your picture at the first opportunity.</t5862> <t5863>Please destroy what I have written - but of course, the ring carrying my hair can remain with you.</t5863><t5864>"</t5864>
<t5865>Elinor read it and returned it without comment.</t5865>
<t5866>"I won't ask you how you found it as a composition," said Edward.</t5866> <t5867>"In the past, I wouldn't want you to see his letter even if they gave me the world.</t5867> <t5868>Bad enough for an aunt, but for a wife! -how my face would blush while reading what he wrote!</t5868> <t5869>-I can even say that this is the only letter I received from him since the first six months of our silly business, whose subject made me forgive its stylistic flaws from my perspective.</t5869><t5870>"</t5870>
<t5871>"Whatever has happened, has happened," said Elinor, shortly after -"it is certain that they are married.</t5871> <t5872>Your mother has given herself a very fitting punishment.</t5872> <t5873>Because she was offended by you, the independence she gave to Robert allowed him the chance to make his own choice; in fact, she was bribing one son with a thousand pounds a year to do the very things for which the other was disinherited.</t5873> <t5874>In my opinion, Robert marrying Lucy will hurt her less than if he had married you.</t5874><t5875>"</t5875>
<t5876>"It will hurt more, because Robert has always been her favorite.</t5876> <t5877>-It will hurt more and for the same reason, she will forgive him more quickly.</t5877><t5878>"</t5878>
<t5879>Edward did not know what the situation among them currently was, because he had not yet attempted to meet with anyone from his family.</t5879> <t5880>He had left Oxford twenty-four hours after Lucy's letter arrived; he had a single goal in mind, the nearest road to Barton; and he had no time to devise any plan of action unrelated to this path.</t5880> <t5881>He could do nothing until he was certain of Miss Dashwood's fate; while seeking that fate, despite the jealousy he once felt towards Colonel Brandon, and despite the humility with which he valued himself and the politeness with which he spoke of his doubts, he did not expect a very harsh reception.</t5881> <t5882>Nevertheless, it was his job to say he expected it, and he said it quite sweetly.</t5882> <t5883>What he might say about the matter a year later should be left to the imagination of married couples.</t5883>
<t5884>It was quite clear to Elinor that Lucy was trying to deceive them with the message she sent to Thomas, intending to do one last evil to Edward on her way out; Edward, who had now fully seen Lucy's true nature, believed that she was capable of any kind of vulgarity.</t5884> <t5885>Although he had begun to notice her ignorance and lack of refinement in some situations long before he met Elinor, he had attributed these to her lack of education; until he received the letter, he had always believed her to be a good-natured, kind-hearted girl who was extremely devoted to him.</t5885> <t5886>Nothing but such a belief could have prevented him from ending a relationship that had been a constant source of unrest and sorrow for him long before it was discovered and exposed to his mother's wrath.</t5886>
<t5887>"Apart from my feelings," he said, "I thought it was my duty to leave the choice of continuing or not continuing our relationship to her when my mother rejected me and I had no one left in the world to support me.</t5887> <t5888>In such a situation, when there was nothing left to provoke anyone's greed or ambition, how could I think that her insistence, her eagerness to share my fate, was motivated by anything other than selfless love?</t5888> <t5889>Even now, I cannot understand what impulse drove her, what she expected to gain, when she attached herself to a man she felt no affection for and who had only two thousand pounds in the world.</t5889> <t5890>She could not have guessed that Colonel Brandon would give me a church.</t5890><t5891>"</t5891>
<t5892>"No, but he could have guessed that something would work in your favor, that your family would be convinced over time.</t5892> <t5893>In any case, he wouldn't lose anything by continuing the relationship, because it doesn't seem like he limited either his inclinations or his actions.</t5893> <t5894>Marriage was certainly a respectable situation and probably increased his importance among his friends; if nothing more beneficial came out of it, marrying you would be better than staying single.</t5894><t5895>"</t5895>
<t5896>Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could be more natural than Lucy's behavior, nor more obvious than the impulse behind it.</t5896>
<t5897>Elinor scolded him, for spending so much time with them at Norland and not feeling disloyal, with the harshness that ladies always use to rebuke the faults of those who compliment them.</t5897>
<t5898>"Your behavior was clearly wrong," he said, "because - putting my thoughts aside, all my relatives started daydreaming and expecting something that could never be according to the situation at the time.</t5898><t5899>"</t5899>
<t5900>Edward's only defense was not knowing his own heart and having a misplaced confidence in the strength of their union.</t5900>
<t5901>"I was so naive that I thought there could be no danger in being with you because my loyalty belonged to someone else; knowing my companionship would keep my heart as safe and untouchable as my honor.</t5901> <t5902>I felt that I liked you, but I kept telling myself it was just friendship, and I didn't realize how far I had progressed until I started comparing you with Lucy.</t5902> <t5903>After that, I think I made a mistake by staying too long in Sussex, and the explanations I gave myself about its appropriateness were no better than these: -The danger is mine; I am not harming anyone but myself.</t5903><t5904>"</t5904>
<t5905>Elinor smiled and nodded.</t5905>
<t5906>Edward was delighted to learn that Colonel Brandon was expected at the Cottage; he both wanted to get to know him better and to convince him that he no longer harbored any resentment for giving the church at Delaford - "At present," he said, "he must think that I have not forgiven him for the offer after such an ungrateful expression of gratitude as mine."</t5906><t5907>"</t5907>
<t5908>Now she was surprised that she had not yet gone there.</t5908> <t5909>But she had shown so little interest in the matter that she had learned everything she knew about the house, garden, and surroundings, the boundaries of the village, the condition of the land, and the tax rates from Elinor.</t5909> <t5910>Elinor had learned these from Colonel Brandon and had listened to him carefully enough to fully understand the subject.</t5910>
<t5911>After this, there was only one unresolved issue between them, a single difficulty to be overcome.</t5911> <t5912>Their love had brought them together, the fervent support of their relatives and their good understanding of each other seemed to ensure their happiness - now they just didn't know what they would live on.</t5912> <t5913>Edward had two thousand pounds, Elinor had one; this, along with the church at Delaford, was all the resources they could call their own; it was impossible for Mrs. Dashwood to support them, and neither of them was in love enough to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a year would allow them to live comfortably.</t5913>
<t5914>Edward had not completely lost hope that there would be a positive change in his mother and was relying on this for the rest of his income.</t5914> <t5915>But Elinor did not share this confidence, because Edward still could not marry Miss Morton and, having chosen himself, was considered by Mrs. Ferrars in her flattering language as the lesser of two evils compared to Lucy Steele, thus thinking that Robert's crime would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny.</t5915>
<t5916>About four days after Edward's arrival, Colonel Brandon appeared, adding to Mrs. Dashwood's pleasure and giving her the pride of hosting more guests in her home than it had ever accommodated since she started living in Barton.</t5916> <t5917>Edward was allowed to maintain the privilege of being the first to arrive, so Colonel Brandon walked to his old headquarters at the Park every night, usually returning from there every morning early enough to interrupt the lovers' first conversation before breakfast.</t5917>
<t5918>At least during the evening hours, having little else to do but calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and seventeen, a three-week stay at Delaford had left him in need of Barton, of all the progress in Marianne's appearance to cheer him up, of all the warmth in her reception of him, and of all the support in her mother's words.</t5918> <t5919>But among such friends and so many compliments, his spirits lifted.</t5919> <t5920>He had not yet heard any rumors about Lucy's marriage; -he did not know what had happened; thus, the first hours of his visit passed in listening and astonishment.</t5920> <t5921>Mrs. Dashwood told him everything, and he found a new source of joy in the action he had taken for Mr. Ferrars, because the situation benefited Elinor.</t5921>
<t5922>There is no need to say that the gentlemen thought positively of each other; their acquaintance progressed, as it could not have been otherwise.</t5922> <t5923>Principles and common sense, similarities in temperament and way of thinking would probably have been enough to make them friends even without any other attraction, but their love for two sisters and the sisters' affection for each other made this mutual respect, which might otherwise have awaited the effects of time and judgment, inevitable and accelerated it.</t5923>
<t5924>The letters coming from the city, which would have set Elinor's nerves on edge a few days ago, were now read with joy rather than excitement.</t5924> <t5925>In her letter, Mrs. Jennings was recounting that wonderful story, berating the deceitful girl, and pouring out her feelings of pity for poor Mr. Edward; according to her, Mr. Edward was deeply in love with that worthless flirt and was now heartbroken in Oxford.</t5925> <t5926>"Surely," she continued, "such vileness has never been seen; just two days ago, Lucy visited me and sat with me for a few hours.</t5926> <t5927>Not a single person suspected anything, not even Nancy, poor thing! because Nancy came to me the next day in tears, terrified of Mrs. Ferrars' wrath, and not knowing how to get to Plymouth, because it seems that Lucy had borrowed all her money before going off to get married, probably to show off; poor Nancy was left penniless; -so I gladly gave her five guineas to take her as far as Exeter, where she plans to stay with Mrs. Burgess for three or four weeks, hoping, as I told her, to reconcile with the doctor.</t5927> <t5928>I must say, Lucy's not taking her along in the carriage is the height of ingratitude.</t5928> <t5929>Poor Mr. Edward! I can't get him out of my mind, but you must invite him to Barton, and Miss Marianne should comfort him.</t5929><t5930>"</t5930>
<t5931>Mr. Dashwood's sorrow was more dignified.</t5931> <t5932>Mrs. Ferrars was a most unfortunate woman - poor Fanny had suffered nervous breakdowns - as for herself, she watched with grateful amazement that both of them were still alive despite such a blow.</t5932> <t5933>Robert's insult was unforgivable, but Lucy's was even worse.</t5933> <t5934>Mrs. Ferrars would never mention either of their names again; even if she were to forgive her son in the future, his wife would never again be referred to as her daughter, nor would she be allowed to appear by her side.</t5934> <t5935>The secrecy with which they handled everything greatly magnified the offense, because if others had suspected, necessary measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage; furthermore, she invited Elinor to share in her regret that Edward had not married her rather than allowing Lucy to spread disgrace within the family.</t5935> <t5936>-And she added the following.</t5936>
<t5937>"Mrs. Ferrars has not yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not surprise us; but we were greatly astonished to see that not a single line was obtained from her on the subject.</t5937> <t5938>But perhaps she remains silent out of fear of causing offense; therefore, I will write to Oxford and hint to him that both his sister and I think that a tactful letter of apology addressed to Fanny, which Fanny can show to her mother, might not be out of place; because we all know how compassionate Mrs. Ferrars is, how she wishes to be in harmony with her children.</t5938><t5939>"</t5939>
<t5940>This paragraph was important in terms of Edward's hopes and behavior.</t5940> <t5941>It was calling him to make an attempt at reconciliation, though not exactly in the way his brother-in-law and sister had shown.</t5941>
<t5942>"A tactful apology letter!" he repeated; "Do they want me to ask my mother's forgiveness for Robert's ingratitude towards her and his betrayal towards me?</t5942> <t5943>-I ask for nothing.</t5943> <t5944>-What happened neither diminished me nor made me regretful.</t5944> <t5945>-I have become a very happy person, but that does not concern them.</t5945> <t5946>-I do not know of a way to apologize that would be tactful for me.</t5946><t5947>"</t5947>
<t5948>"Of course, you may want to be forgiven," said Elinor, "because you have offended; -in fact, I think you might even try to express your regret for the words that upset your mother."</t5948><t5949>"</t5949>
<t5950>Edward agreed that he could try.</t5950>
<t5951>"And when she forgives you, it might be appropriate to be a bit humble, while telling her that you got engaged to a second girl who is as unsuitable in her eyes as the first one."</t5951><t5952>"</t5952>
<t5953>Edward did not object to this, but he still resisted the idea of a proper apology letter; therefore, to make the matter easier, because he preferred to say the considerable concessions he would make rather than write them in a letter, it was decided that instead of writing to Fanny, he would go to London and personally request a charitable endeavor on her behalf.</t5953> <t5954>"If they are genuinely interested in reconciling you," said Marianne with a newfound frankness, "then I will start to think that John and Fanny are not so worthless after all.</t5954><t5955>"</t5955>
<t5956>Colonel Brandon stayed only three or four days, and the two gentlemen left Barton together.</t5956> <t5957>-They went straight to Delaford so that Edward could see his future home for himself and assist his patron and friend in deciding on the necessary repairs; after spending a few nights there, Edward continued on his way to the city.</t5957>
<t5958>After a proper resistance, that is, a resistance that was strong and persistent enough to protect her from the shame she always feared would befall her—the shame of being too soft-hearted—Mrs. Ferrars accepted Edward into her presence and declared him her son once again.</t5958>
<t5959>His family had been quite turbulent lately.</t5959> <t5960>For most of his life, he had two sons; but a few weeks ago, Edward's crime and rebellion had cost him one son; Robert's similar rebellion had left him completely sonless for fifteen days; now, with Edward's revival, he had one son again.</t5960>
<t5961>However, even though he was allowed to live once more, Edward could not feel that his life was safe until he announced his engagement again; he feared that the revelation of the truth could cause a sudden change in his situation and take him back as quickly as he had come.</t5961> <t5962>Therefore, he explained it very cautiously and was listened to with unexpected calmness.</t5962> <t5963>Mrs. Ferrars, naturally at first, tried with all her means to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood; she told him that he would find a woman of higher status and greater wealth in Miss Morton; she strengthened her argument by stating that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while the other was just the daughter of a free man with only three; but Ed-</t5963>
<t5964>When he saw that Ward, although acknowledging the reality, was unwilling to accept his thoughts, he decided that the wisest course, based on past experience, was to yield - thus, after such a stubborn delay, which he owed to his pride and which left no room for any suspicion of goodwill, he approved the marriage of Edward and Elinor.</t5964>
<t5965>The next thing to consider was what they would do to increase their income; here, it was clearly revealed that although Edward was the only son, he was not the eldest; while Robert was inevitably given a thousand pounds a year, there was no objection to Edward entering the church for a mere two hundred and fifty; aside from the ten thousand pounds given to Fanny, no other promises were made for now or the future.</t5965>
<t5966>Nevertheless, this was not less than what Edward and Elinor desired, but more than they expected; judging by her mixed excuses, Mrs. Ferrars herself seemed to be the only person surprised that she did not give more.</t5966>
<t5967>After securing an income that would comfortably support them, the only thing left to do was to wait until Edward took charge of the church, but Colonel Brandon, in order to make Elinor comfortable, had enthusiastically started repairs at home. After waiting for these to be completed, and after thousands of mishaps and delays caused by the usual incredible carelessness of the workers, Elinor abandoned her initial decision not to marry until everything was ready, and the ceremony took place at Barton church in early autumn.</t5967>
<t5968>They spent the first month after the wedding in Konak with their friends; from there, they could oversee the progress of the lodge; they could manage everything on-site as they wished; -they could choose the wallpaper, design the shrubbery, and invent a winding path.</t5968> <t5969>Mrs. Jennings' predictions, although somewhat mixed up, essentially came true; because by Michaelmas, she could visit Edward and his wife at their lodge, and she saw Elinor and her husband as the happiest couple in the world, with all her sincerity.</t5969> <t5970>Indeed, they lacked nothing, except for Colonel Brandon and Marianne's marriage and the need for better pasture for their cows.</t5970>
<t5971>When they settled into their home, almost all their relatives and friends came to visit them.</t5971> <t5972>Mrs. Ferrars came to witness the happiness she was almost ashamed to have approved of; even the Dashwoods spent money to come all the way from Sussex to honor them.</t5972>
<t5973>"I can't say I'm disappointed, dear sister," said John, as they walked together one morning in front of the gates of Delaford House, "that would be too much, because it's clear, you are already one of the luckiest young women in the world.</t5973> <t5974>But I must admit, calling Colonel Brandon brother-in-law would please me very much.</t5974> <t5975>The estate here, the land, the house, everything is in a very respectable and perfect condition! -especially the forest!</t5975> <t5976>-I haven't seen as much wood anywhere in Dorsetshire as there is now in Delaford Grove!</t5976> <t5977>-Although Marianne doesn't seem like the ideal person to attract him -still, I think it might be wise to ensure they stay here often, by your side; because Colonel Brandon is often at home and who knows what might happen -since people often start seeing each other more and others less -it would be in your hands to put him in an advantageous position; -in short, you could very well give him a chance -You understand me, don't you.</t5977><t5978>"-</t5978>
<t5979>Although Mrs. Ferrars came to see them, she always treated them with a false affection; they never received her genuine interest and preference.</t5979> <t5980>-This was due to Robert's foolishness and his wife's cunning; they achieved this within a few months.</t5980> <t5981>His wife's selfish intelligence, which first got Robert into trouble, then became the main tool to get him out of it; her respectful docility, tireless interest, and endless compliments, when given the slightest opportunity to apply them, ensured that Mrs. Ferrars accepted Robert's choice and that Robert became her favorite again.</t5981>
<t5982>Lucy’s entire attitude in the matter, and the victory that crowned this attitude, can be seen as a very encouraging example of what can be achieved in terms of gaining wealth without sacrificing anything other than time and conscience, even if the path may sometimes seem obstructed.</t5982><t5983>When Robert first wanted to meet her and secretly visited her at Bartlett Building, his intention was solely related to his brother.</t5983><t5984>He was only thinking of convincing Lucy to end the relationship; naturally, he hoped to resolve the matter in one or two meetings since there was no obstacle other than their love to overcome.</t5984><t5985>However, at that point, and only at that point, he was mistaken; -because although Lucy gave him the hope that his persuasive ability would convince her over time, each time he needed one more meeting to reach that persuasion.</t5985><t5986>Whenever they parted, he always had some doubts in his mind, which he thought he could resolve by talking to her in person for another half hour.</t5986><t5987>Thus, his visits were secured, and the rest followed gradually.</t5987><t5988>Instead of talking about Edward, they gradually started talking only about Robert; -which was Robert’s favorite subject to talk about, and soon Lucy also showed that she was as interested in this subject as he was; in short, they both quickly realized that Robert had taken his brother’s place.</t5988><t5989>Now he was proud of his conquest, proud of outsmarting his brother, and very proud of secretly marrying without his mother’s consent.</t5989><t5990>What followed is well known.</t5990><t5991>They spent a few months in great happiness in Dawlish; because Lucy had many relatives and old acquaintances to show off to -Robert also drew magnificent cottage plans; -on their way back to the city, they won Mrs. Ferrars' heart, with just the simple effort of wanting to, encouraged by Lucy.</t5991><t5992>The forgiveness, of course, initially only included Robert; Lucy remained unforgiven for a few more weeks, even though she could not have wronged her mother-in-law in any way since she had no duty towards her.</t5992><t5993>But the persistence in humility of behavior and expression, blaming herself for Robert’s fault, and being grateful in the face of ill-treatment eventually earned her a haughty interest, which first delighted her with its generosity and soon after rapidly elevated her to the highest ranks of love and influence.</t5993><t5994>Lucy became as indispensable to Mrs. Ferrars as Robert and Fanny; whereas Edward was never properly forgiven for once wanting to marry her; Elinor, though superior to Lucy in both wealth and position, was always seen as a stranger; but Lucy was considered in every matter and always openly referred to as the most beloved daughter-in-law.</t5994><t5995>They settled in the city; received generous support from Mrs. Ferrars; had the best imaginable relationship with the Dashwoods; nothing could be greater than the happiness they all lived together, except for the constant jealousy and enmity between Fanny and Lucy, which their husbands naturally joined, and the frequent family quarrels between Robert and Lucy.</t5995>
<t5996>Many might be surprised to learn how Edward renounced his right as the eldest son; learning how Robert acquired that title might be even more surprising.</t5996> <t5997>However, it turned out to be a justified arrangement, if not by its reasons, then by its results; because nothing in Robert's way of living or speaking suggested that he was discontent with his income level, neither in the sense that he left very little to his brother nor that he took too much for himself; -As for Edward, considering his wholehearted fulfillment of his duties, his increasing devotion to his wife and home, and his consistent cheerfulness, it can be inferred that he was not at all dissatisfied with his situation and had no desire to trade places with him.</t5997>
<t5998>Since her mother and sisters spent half their time with her, Elinor's marriage separated her from her family as little as possible, but the cottage at Barton was not completely deserted.</t5998> <t5999>Mrs. Dashwood, in the frequency of her visits to Delaford, considered her pleasure as much as her plans;</t5999>
<t6000>Marianne's desire to bring Colonel Brandon together had never diminished, even if it had become a bit more obvious than John had expressed.</t6000> <t6001>Now it was her favorite topic.</t6001> <t6002>Of course, being with her daughter made her happy, but she wanted more than anything to forever relinquish that happiness in favor of her dear friend; seeing Marianne settle in the mansion was also the wish of Edward and Elinor.</t6002> <t6003>They all felt Colonel Brandon's sorrow and their own obligations, and Marianne would be the reward for all these shared sentiments.</t6003>
<t6004>When such a gang was formed against him - while he himself was well aware of Colonel Brandon's kindness - after everyone had seen it clearly for a long time, he finally realized that he was in love with him - what else could he do?</t6004>
<t6005>Marianne Dashwood was born with an extraordinary fate.</t6005> <t6006>She was born to see the error of her views and to invalidate her favorite maxims with her actions.</t6006> <t6007>She was born to overcome the love she held at the advanced age of seventeen, and to willingly give her hand to another with feelings that were not superior to strong respect and cheerful friendship!</t6007> <t6008>-and that other person, who had suffered at least as much as she had from a previous relationship, a man she found too old to marry two years ago, -and who still sought the comfort of woolen vests for his health!</t6008>
<t6009>But it was so.</t6009> <t6010>Instead of falling victim to an irresistible passion, as she once imagined with insistent pride, -or even later, as she decided in her more sensible days, to stay with her mother forever and find her only happiness in seclusion and reading -at the age of nineteen, she found herself embracing new commitments, taking on new duties, settling into a new home, becoming a wife, and becoming the lady of a family and the mistress of a village.</t6010>
<t6011>Colonel Brandon was now as happy a man as everyone who loved him dearly believed he deserved to be; -he found solace in Marianne for all his past troubles; -Marianne's care and companionship revitalized and cheered him; their close ones observed that Marianne found her happiness in making him happy.</t6011> <t6012>Marianne could not love halfway; over time, her whole heart was devoted to her husband, just as it once was with Willoughby.</t6012>
<t6013>Willoughby learned with pain that she had married; soon after, he found his punishment in Mrs. Smith's spontaneous forgiveness; she cited his marriage to a decent woman as the reason for her forgiveness, which led Willoughby to realize that if he had behaved honorably towards Marianne, he would have been both happy and wealthy.</t6013> <t6014>It should not be doubted that he felt sincere remorse for his behavior, which found its own punishment in this way; -nor that he had long thought of Colonel Brandon with jealousy and Marianne with regret.</t6014> <t6015>But it should not be believed that he found no solace forever, that he avoided people, that he was disillusioned with life, or even that he died of a broken heart -because none of these happened.</t6015> <t6016>He pulled himself together and often enjoyed himself.</t6016> <t6017>His wife was not an entirely sullen woman, nor was his home an unbearably restless place; by breeding horses and dogs, and hunting in every way, he found a considerable measure of family happiness.</t6017>
<t6018>For Marianne, however -despite the discourtesy he showed by continuing to live after losing her- he always maintained that resolute love concerning everything that happened to Marianne and made her his secret standard of female perfection; -in later times, he scorned many young beauties as they could not be compared to Mrs. Brandon.</t6018>
<t6019>Mrs. Dashwood had the good sense to stay in the cottage; she did not attempt to move to Delaford; when Marianne was taken from them, fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, Margaret had come of age to dance, and there was no reason to think she could not have a suitor.</t6019>
<t6020>There was naturally that constant coming and going between Barton and Delaford, created by the strong family ties; -Among the privileges and happiness of Elinor and Marianne, even though they were sisters and lived in each other's sight, it should not be thought that living without falling into disagreement with each other or causing coldness between their husbands occupied a small place.</t6020>
<t6021>SON</t6021>
