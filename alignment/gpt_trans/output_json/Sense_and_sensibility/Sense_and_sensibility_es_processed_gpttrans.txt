<t0>CHAPTER I</t0>
<t1>The Dashwood family had long been settled in Sussex.</t1><t2>Their property was of good size, and at its center was the residence, Norland Park, where the dignified manner in which they had lived for many generations earned them the respect of all the local acquaintances.</t2><t3>The last owner of this property had been a bachelor who reached a very advanced age and who, for much of his life, had his sister as a faithful companion and housekeeper.</t3><t4>But her death, which occurred ten years before his own, caused great changes in his household.</t4><t5>To compensate for such a loss, he invited and received into his home the family of his nephew, Mr. Henry Dashwood, the rightful heir to the Norland estate and the person to whom he intended to leave it in his will.</t5><t6>In the company of his nephew and niece, and their children, life passed comfortably for the elderly gentleman.</t6><t7>His attachment to all of them grew over time.</t7><t8>The constant attention that Mr. Henry Dashwood and his wife paid to his wishes, born not of mere interest but of the goodness of their hearts, made his life comfortable in all that, due to his age, could suit him; and the joy of the children added new delights to his existence.</t8>
<t9>From a previous marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had a son; and from his current wife, three daughters.</t9> <t10>The son, a serious and respectable young man, had his future secured by his mother's fortune, which was considerable, and of which he had come into possession of half upon reaching the age of majority.</t10> <t11>Moreover, his own marriage, which occurred shortly after, made him even wealthier.</t11> <t12>For him, then, the inheritance of the Norland estate was not truly as important as it was for his sisters; for they, regardless of what might come to them if their father inherited that property, were of a fortune that can only be considered meager.</t12> <t13>Their mother had nothing, and the father could only dispose of seven thousand pounds, because the son was also a beneficiary of the remaining half of his first wife's fortune, and he only had the right to the usufruct of that patrimony while he lived.</t13>
<t14>The elderly gentleman passed away, his will was read, and, like almost all wills, it brought both disappointments and joys.</t14> <t15>In his last will, he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to deprive his nephew of the lands, but he left them under such terms that they destroyed half the value of the legacy.</t15> <t16>Mr. Dashwood had desired these properties more for the well-being of his wife and daughters than for himself and his son; however, the inheritance was assigned to his son, and to his son's son, a four-year-old child, in such a way that it deprived him of any possibility to care for those dearest to him and who most needed support, whether through an eventual mortgage on the properties or the sale of their valuable forests.</t16> <t17>Necessary provisions had been made to ensure that everything would benefit this child, who, during his occasional visits to Norland with his father and mother, had won his uncle's affection with those charming traits that are not uncommon in children of two or three years old: imperfect pronunciation, the unwavering desire to always have his way, countless pranks and tricks, and lots of noise, charms that ultimately ended up outweighing the value of all the attentions that the gentleman had received for years from his niece and her daughters.</t17> <t18>It was not his intention, however, to lack kindness, and as a sign of his affection for the three girls, he left a thousand pounds to each of them.</t18>
<t19>At first, Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was profound; but he was of a cheerful and trusting temperament; he could reasonably expect to live many years and, by living frugally, save a considerable sum from the income of an already sizable estate, and one capable of almost immediate increase.</t19> <t20>But the fortune, which had taken so long to arrive, was his for only a year.</t20> <t21>He survived his uncle by no more than that, and ten thousand pounds, including the last legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters.</t21>
<t22>As soon as it was known that Mr. Dashwood's life was in danger, they sent for his son, and the father entrusted him, with the intensity and urgency that the illness necessitated, with the well-being of his stepmother and sisters.</t22>
<t23>Mr. John Dashwood did not have the depth of feelings of the rest of the family, but he was affected by such a recommendation at a moment like that, and he promised to do everything possible for the well-being of his relatives.</t23> <t24>The father felt reassured by such a promise, and Mr. John Dashwood then took his time to consider how much he could prudently do for them.</t24>
<t25>John Dashwood was not an ill-disposed young man, unless being somewhat cold-hearted and a little selfish counts as ill-disposed; but in general, he was respected because he behaved correctly in the performance of his everyday duties.</t25> <t26>Had he married a kinder woman, he might have become more respectable than he was —he might even have turned into a kind person himself— because he was very young when he married and was very fond of his wife.</t26> <t27>But Mrs. John Dashwood was a harsh caricature of her husband, narrower-minded and more selfish than he was.</t27>
<t28>When making the promise to his father, he had internally weighed the possibility of increasing his sisters' fortune by gifting them a thousand pounds each.</t28> <t29>At that moment, he truly felt up to such a task.</t29> <t30>The prospect of increasing his current income by four thousand pounds annually, which would be added to the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, gladdened his heart and made him feel very generous.</t30> <t31>“Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: What a splendid and generous gesture!</t31> <t32>It would be enough to leave them in complete comfort.</t32> <t33>Three thousand pounds!</t33> <t34>He could part with such a considerable sum with almost no inconvenience.”</t34> <t35>He thought about it all day, and for many successive days, and he did not regret it.</t35>
<t36>No sooner had the funeral of his father ended when John Dashwood's wife, without having given any notice of her intentions to her mother-in-law, arrived with her son and her servants.</t36> <t37>No one could dispute her right to come: the house belonged to her husband from the very moment of his father's death.</t37> <t38>But that very fact aggravated the lack of delicacy in her conduct, and no special sensitivity was needed for any woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation to feel greatly wronged by it; in her, however, there was such a high sense of honor, such a romantic generosity, that any offense of this kind, whether exercised or received by anyone, became a source of indelible displeasure.</t38> <t39>Mrs. John Dashwood had never counted on the special favor of anyone in her husband's family; but, until now, she had not had the opportunity to show them how little consideration for the well-being of others she could act with when the occasion required it.</t39>
<t40>Mrs. Dashwood felt this discourteous behavior so acutely, and it produced such intense disdain towards her daughter-in-law, that upon the latter's arrival she would have left the house forever had it not been for, first, her eldest daughter's plea which led her to reflect on the advisability of doing so; and later, the tender love she felt for her three daughters, which decided her to stay and for their sake avoid a rupture with their brother.</t40>
<t41>Elinor, this eldest daughter whose recommendation had been so effective, possessed a solidity of understanding and serenity of judgment that qualified her, even at only nineteen years old, to advise her mother, and often allowed her to counteract, for the benefit of the whole family, that vehemence of spirit in Mrs. Dashwood that so often could lead her to imprudence.</t41> <t42>She was of great heart, affectionate character, and deep feelings.</t42> <t43>But she knew how to govern them: something her mother had yet to learn, and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught.</t43>
<t44>Marianne's qualities were, in many respects, on par with Elinor's.</t44> <t45>She had intelligence and good judgment, but she was vehement in everything; neither her sorrows nor her joys knew moderation.</t45> <t46>She was generous, kind, attractive: she was everything, except prudent.</t46> <t47>The resemblance between her and her mother was remarkable.</t47>
<t48>Elinor was worried about her sister's excessive sensitivity, the same that Mrs. Dashwood valued and appreciated.</t48> <t49>In the current circumstances, they incited each other to live their grief without allowing its intensity to diminish.</t49> <t50>They voluntarily renewed, sought, and recreated over and over again the agony of sorrow that had overwhelmed them at the beginning.</t50> <t51>They completely surrendered to their grief, seeking to increase their misery with every image capable of reflecting it, and decided never to admit consolation in the future.</t51> <t52>Elinor was also deeply afflicted, but she could still fight and strive.</t52> <t53>She could consult with her brother, receive her sister-in-law upon her arrival and offer her the due attention; and she could strive to induce her mother to similar efforts and encourage her to achieve such self-control.</t53>
<t54>Margaret, the other sister, was a cheerful and good-natured girl, but having already absorbed a good dose of Marianne's romantic ideas without possessing much of her sensibility, at thirteen years old she did not promise to equal her older sisters in later stages of her life.</t54>
<t55>CHAPTER II</t55>
<t56>Mrs. John Dashwood settled in as the mistress of Norland, and her mother-in-law and sisters-in-law were relegated to the status of visitors.</t56> <t57>As such, however, she treated them with calm civility, and her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anyone beyond himself, his wife, and son.</t57> <t58>He actually insisted, with some tenacity, that they consider Norland their home; and since no plan seemed as convenient to Mrs. Dashwood as staying there until they could settle in a house nearby, she accepted his invitation.</t58>
<t59>Staying in a place where everything reminded her of past delights was exactly what suited her mind.</t59> <t60>In good times, no one had a more cheerful temperament than hers or possessed to a greater degree that optimistic expectation of happiness which is happiness itself.</t60> <t61>But even in sorrow, she let herself be carried away by fantasy, and she became as inaccessible to consolation as in pleasure she was beyond all moderation.</t61>
<t62>Mrs. John Dashwood did not approve at all of what her husband intended to do for his sisters.</t62> <t63>Reducing their dear little boy's fortune by three thousand pounds would mean impoverishing him in the most atrocious manner.</t63> <t64>She implored him to reconsider.</t64> <t65>How could he justify to himself depriving his son, his only son, of such a large sum?</t65> <t66>And what right could the Miss Dashwoods, who were only his half-sisters —which to her meant they were not really relatives— have to demand such a large amount from his generosity?</t66> <t67>It was well known that no kind of affection could be expected between the children of a man's different marriages; and why should they ruin themselves, he and his poor little Harry, by giving all their money to his half-sisters?</t67>
<t68>—It was my father's last request —her husband replied—, that I help his widow and his daughters.</t68>
<t69>—I would dare to say that he didn't know what he was talking about; ten to one that his mind was failing him at that moment.</t69> <t70>If he had been in his right mind, it couldn't have occurred to him to ask you for something like that, to strip your own son of half your fortune.</t70>
<t71>—My dear Fanny, he did not stipulate any particular amount; he only asked me, in general terms, to support them and make their situation more comfortable than it was within his means to do.</t71> <t72>Perhaps it would have been better if he had left everything to my discretion.</t72> <t73>He could hardly have supposed that I would abandon them to their fate.</t73> <t74>But since he wanted me to promise, I could not help but do so.</t74> <t75>At least, that was what I thought at the time.</t75> <t76>Thus, the promise existed, and it must be fulfilled.</t76> <t77>Something must be done for them when they leave Norland and settle in a new home.</t77>
<t78>—Alright, then, we have to do something for them; but that something doesn't need to be three thousand pounds.</t78> <t79>Keep in mind —he added— that when you part with money, you never get it back.</t79> <t80>Your sisters will get married, and it will be gone forever.</t80> <t81>If only someday they could return it to our poor little boy...</t81>
<t82>—But, of course —said her husband with great seriousness—, that would change everything.</t82> <t83>A time may come when Harry regrets having parted with such a large sum.</t83> <t84>If, for example, he were to have a large family, it would be a very convenient supplement to his income.</t84>
<t85>—Anyway, it would be.</t85>
<t86>—Perhaps, then, it would be better for everyone if the amount were reduced by half.</t86> <t87>Five hundred pounds would mean a tremendous increase in their fortunes.</t87>
<t88>—Ah, beyond anything that could be imagined!</t88> <t89>What person in the world would do even half as much for their sisters, even if they were true sisters!</t89> <t90>And in this case... only half-sisters!</t90> <t91>But you have such a generous spirit!</t91>
<t92>—I wouldn't want to do anything mean —he replied—.</t92> <t93>On these occasions, one would prefer to do too much rather than too little.</t93> <t94>At least, no one can think that I haven't done enough for them; even they themselves can hardly expect more.</t94>
<t95>—Impossible to know what they might expect -said the lady—, but it is not for us to think about their expectations.</t95> <t96>The point is what you can afford to do.</t96>
<t97>—Undoubtedly, and I believe I can afford to give five hundred pounds to each of them.</t97> <t98>As things stand, without me adding anything, each will have more than three thousand pounds upon their mother's death: a very satisfactory fortune for any young woman.</t98>
<t99>—Of course it is; and, in truth, it occurs to me that perhaps they might not want any additional sum.</t99> <t100>They will have ten thousand pounds among the three of them.</t100> <t101>If they marry, they will surely make a good match; and if they do not, they can live together very comfortably on the interest from the ten thousand pounds.</t101>
<t102>—Absolutely true, and, therefore, I don't know if, all things considered, it wouldn't be more advisable to do something for their mother while she is alive, rather than for them; something like an annual pension, I mean.</t102> <t103>My sisters would benefit from it as much as she would.</t103> <t104>A hundred pounds a year would keep them in perfect comfort.</t104>
<t105>His wife hesitated somewhat, however, in giving her approval to this plan.</t105>
<t106>—Anyway, he said—, it's better than parting with five hundred pounds all at once.</t106> <t107>But if Mrs. Dashwood lives fifteen more years, that will turn into an abuse.</t107>
<t108>—Fifteen years!</t108> <t109>My dear Fanny, her life cannot be worth even half that amount.</t109>
<t110>—Of course not; but, if you notice, people always live forever when there is a pension involved; and she is very strong and healthy, and has barely turned forty.</t110> <t111>An annual pension is a very serious matter; it repeats year after year and there is no way to get rid of it.</t111> <t112>One does not realize what one is doing.</t112> <t113>I have indeed known quite a bit about the problems that annual pensions bring, because my mother was bound by the obligation to pay them to three former retired servants, as my father had established in his will.</t113> <t114>It is incredible how unpleasant she found it.</t114> <t115>Twice a year these pensions had to be paid; and, moreover, there was the problem of getting it to each one; then it was said that one of them had died, and later it turned out that it was not so.</t115> <t116>The whole matter made my mother sick.</t116> <t117>Her income was not her own, she said, with these perpetual demands; and it had been very inconsiderate of my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been completely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction.</t117> <t118>From there came my abhorrence of pensions, that I am sure I will never bind myself to the payment of one for anything in the world.</t118>
<t119>—It is indeed unpleasant —replied Mr. Dashwood— that every year a part of one's income slips away in that manner.</t119> <t120>The assets one counts on, as your mother so rightly says, are not one's own.</t120> <t121>Being obliged to pay a sum like that regularly on fixed dates is not desirable at all: it deprives one of their independence.</t121>
<t122>—Undoubtedly; and, after all, no one thanks you for it.</t122> <t123>They feel that they are entitled, you do no more than what is expected of you, and it does not awaken any gratitude.</t123> <t124>If I were in your place, for anything I did, I would be guided solely by my own judgment.</t124> <t125>I would not commit to giving them anything every year.</t125> <t126>Some years it may be very inconvenient to part with a hundred, or even fifty pounds, taking it out of our own expenses.</t126>
<t127>—I think you're right, my love; it would be better if there were no annual allowance in this case; whatever I can give them occasionally will be of much greater help than an annual allowance, because if they felt secure with a higher income, they would only elevate their lifestyle, and thus they would not be a penny richer at the end of the year.</t127> <t128>Anyway, it will be for the best.</t128> <t129>A gift of fifty pounds from time to time will prevent them from worrying about money matters, and I think it will fully settle the promise made to my father.</t129>
<t130>—Of course he will.</t130> <t131>To tell the truth, I am intimately convinced that your father's idea was not at all for you to give them money.</t131> <t132>I dare say the help he had in mind was what could reasonably be expected of you; for example, things like finding a small and comfortable house for them, helping them move their belongings, sending them some fishing and hunting presents, or something like that, whenever it's the season.</t132> <t133>I would bet my life that he was thinking of no more than that; indeed, it would be quite odd and improper if he had intended anything else.</t133> <t134>If not, think, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how comfortably your mother and her daughters can live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, plus the thousand pounds each of the girls have, which brings them fifty pounds annually per person; and, of course, from there they will pay their mother for her lodging.</t134> <t135>Altogether they will have five hundred pounds annually, and what more could four women possibly need?</t135> <t136>It will be so cheap for them to live!</t136> <t137>The maintenance of the house will be nothing.</t137> <t138>They will have no carriages or horses, and almost no servants; they will not receive visitors, and what expenses will they have!</t138> <t139>Just think how well off they will be!</t139> <t140>Five hundred annually!</t140> <t141>I can't even imagine how they will spend even half of it; and as for giving them more, it is utterly absurd to think about it.</t141> <t142>They will be in a much better position to give you something.</t142>
<t143>—Upon my word —said Mr. Dashwood—, I believe you are absolutely right.</t143> <t144>In any case, with his request, my father could only have meant what you pointed out.</t144> <t145>It seems very clear to me now, and I will strictly fulfill my commitment with some assistance and kindnesses like the ones you have described.</t145> <t146>When my mother moves to another house, I will be at her service in every way possible to accommodate her.</t146> <t147>Perhaps at that time it would also be appropriate to give her a small gift, like some piece of furniture.</t147>
<t148>—Of course —replied Mrs. Dashwood—.</t148> <t149>But, nevertheless, there is one thing that must be taken into account.</t149> <t150>When your father and mother moved to Norland, although they sold the furniture from Stanhill, they kept all the crockery, cutlery, and linens, which now belong to your mother.</t150> <t151>And so, as soon as they move, they will have their house almost completely equipped.</t151>
<t152>—Undoubtedly, that is a reflection of the utmost importance.</t152> <t153>A valuable legacy, of course!</t153> <t154>And part of the silverware would have been a very pleasant addition to ours here.</t154>
<t155>—Yes; and the breakfast crockery is doubly more beautiful than that of this house.</t155> <t156>Too beautiful, in my opinion, for the places where they can afford to live.</t156> <t157>But, anyway, that's the way it is.</t157> <t158>Your father only thought of them.</t158> <t159>And I must say this: you owe him no special gratitude, nor are you obliged to his wishes, because we well know that, if he could have, he would have left almost everything he owned in the world to them.</t159>
<t160>This argument was irresistible.</t160> <t161>In it, John Dashwood found all the strength that he had previously lacked to carry out his intentions; and, finally, he decided that it would be completely unnecessary, if not entirely inappropriate, to do more for his father's widow and daughters than those gestures of good neighborliness that his own wife had suggested to him.</t161>
<t162>CHAPTER III</t162>
<t163>Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland for several months, and it was not because she did not wish to leave once the places she knew so well ceased to evoke the violent emotion they had produced for a time; for when her spirits began to revive and her mind could engage in something other than intensifying her pain through sad memories, she became impatient to leave and tirelessly sought out some suitable residence in the vicinity of Norland, as it was impossible for her to go far from that beloved place.</t163> <t164>But no news came of places that simultaneously satisfied her notions of comfort and well-being and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, who, with more sensible judgment, rejected several houses that her mother would have approved, considering them too large for their income.</t164>
<t165>Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband about the solemn promise made by her son in favor of her and her daughters, which had filled his last thoughts on earth with comfort.</t165> <t166>She did not doubt the sincerity of this commitment any more than the deceased had doubted it, and she felt great satisfaction regarding it, especially thinking about the well-being of her daughters; for her part, however, she was convinced that much less than seven thousand pounds as capital would allow her to live in abundance.</t166> <t167>She also rejoiced for her daughters' brother, for the kindness of that brother, and reproached herself for not having done justice to his merits before, by believing him incapable of generosity.</t167> <t168>His attentive behavior towards her and her sisters convinced her that their well-being was dear to his eyes and, for a long time, she firmly trusted in the generosity of his intentions.</t168>
<t169>The disdain that, very early in their relationship, she had felt for her daughter-in-law, increased considerably upon getting to know her character better after that half year of living with her and her family; and, perhaps, despite all the displays of courtesy and maternal affection that she had shown her, the two ladies would have found it impossible to live together for so long, had it not been for a particular circumstance that made the stay of her daughters at Norland more acceptable in Mrs. Dashwood's opinion.</t169>
<t170>This circumstance was a growing affection between her eldest daughter and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentlemanly and pleasant young man who was introduced to them shortly after his sister's arrival at Norland and who had since spent a great deal of time there.</t170>
<t171>Some mothers might have encouraged that intimacy out of interest, given that Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich; and others would have suppressed it out of prudence, since, except for a trivial sum, his entire fortune depended on his mother's will.</t171> <t172>But none of these considerations weighed on Mrs. Dashwood.</t172> <t173>It was enough for her that he seemed affable, that he loved her daughter, and that this affection was mutual.</t173> <t174>It was contrary to all her beliefs that the difference in fortune should keep a couple attracted by the similarity of their natures apart; and that Elinor's merits were not recognized by those who knew her seemed inconceivable to her.</t174>
<t175>It was not special gifts in his appearance or demeanor that made Edward Ferrars deserving of the good opinion of Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters.</t175> <t176>He was not handsome and only in intimate settings did he show how pleasant his manner could be.</t176> <t177>He was too insecure to do himself justice; but when he overcame his natural shyness, his behavior revealed a frank and affectionate heart.</t177> <t178>He had good understanding and education had given him greater solidity in that aspect.</t178> <t179>But neither his abilities nor his inclination equipped him to satisfy the desires of his mother and sister, who longed to see him distinguished as... they barely knew as what.</t179> <t180>They wanted him to occupy an important place in the world in one way or another.</t180> <t181>His mother wished to interest him in politics, to get him into parliament or to see him connected with some of the great men of the moment.</t181> <t182>Mrs. John Dashwood wished the same; meanwhile, until they could achieve some of those superior blessings, they would have satisfied the ambition of both to see him drive a curricle.</t182> <t183>But Edward had no inclination either towards great men or towards curricles.</t183> <t184>All his desires were centered on domestic comfort and the tranquility of private life.</t184> <t185>Fortunately, he had a younger brother who was more promising.</t185>
<t186>Edward had been in the house for several weeks before Mrs. Dashwood noticed him, as at that time the state of affliction she was in made her completely indifferent to everything around her.</t186> <t187>She only saw that he was quiet and discreet, and she liked him for it.</t187> <t188>He did not disturb the sorrow that filled all her thoughts with untimely conversations.</t188> <t189>What first led her to observe him more closely and to like him even more was a remark Elinor made one day about how different he was from his sister.</t189> <t190>The allusion to this contrast placed him very decidedly in the mother's favor.</t190>
<t191>—That is enough —he said—, it is enough to say that she is not like Fanny.</t191> <t192>It implies that in her one can find all that is amiable.</t192> <t193>I already love her.</t193>
<t194>—I believe you will come to like him —said Elinor— when you get to know him better.</t194>
<t195>—Like it! —replied the mother, with a smile—.</t195> <t196>I cannot harbor any feeling of approval less than love.</t196>
<t197>—I could estimate it.</t197>
<t198>—I have not yet come to know what it is to separate esteem from love.</t198>
<t199>Mrs. Dashwood now endeavored to know him better.</t199> <t200>With her affectionate manners, she quickly overcame the young man's reserve.</t200> <t201>Very soon she noticed how great his merits were; being convinced of his interest in Elinor perhaps made her more perceptive, but she truly felt confident in his worth.</t201> <t202>And even Edward's calm manners, which went against Mrs. Dashwood's most ingrained ideas of how a young man should behave, ceased to seem bland to her when she realized he was warm-hearted and affectionate in temperament.</t202>
<t203>At the first sign of love that he perceived in his behavior towards Elinor, he took the existence of a serious bond between them for granted and began to consider their marriage as something that would soon become a reality.</t203>
<t204>—In a few more months, my dear Marianne —he said to her—, Elinor will surely have settled down for good.</t204> <t205>For us, it will be a loss, but she will be happy.</t205>
<t206>—Oh, mom! What will we do without her?</t206>
<t207>—My love, it will barely be a separation.</t207> <t208>We will live just a few miles apart and we will see each other every day of our lives.</t208> <t209>You will gain a brother, a true, loving brother.</t209> <t210>I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward's feelings...</t210> <t211>But I notice you are serious, Marianne; do you disapprove of your sister's choice?</t211>
<t212>—Perhaps —said Marianne— I might be surprised by something.</t212> <t213>Edward is very kind and I feel great tenderness for him.</t213> <t214>But even so, he is not the kind of young man...</t214> <t215>There is something missing, he does not stand out for his appearance, he completely lacks that grace which I would have expected in the man to whom my sister would feel seriously attracted.</t215> <t216>In his eyes, you do not see all that spirit, that fire, which at once announces virtue and intelligence.</t216> <t217>And besides this, I fear, mama, that he lacks true taste.</t217> <t218>Apparently, music barely interests him, and although he greatly admires Elinor's drawings, it is not the admiration of someone who can understand their value.</t218> <t219>It is evident, despite his assiduous attention when she draws, that in fact he knows nothing about this subject.</t219> <t220>He admires like a lover, not like a connoisseur.</t220> <t221>To feel satisfied, those traits must go together.</t221> <t222>I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not coincide point by point with mine.</t222> <t223>He must penetrate all my feelings; we must both be enchanted by the same books, the same music.</t223> <t224>Oh, mama!</t224> <t225>What a lack of fire, how meek was Edward's attitude when he read to us last night!</t225> <t226>I felt terribly for my sister.</t226> <t227>And yet, she bore it with such composure that she hardly seemed to notice it.</t227> <t228>I could barely remain seated.</t228> <t229>To listen to those beautiful verses that have often almost made me lose my senses, pronounced with such impenetrable calm, such atrocious indifference!</t229>
<t230>—In truth, a simple and elegant prose would have done it much greater justice.</t230> <t231>I thought so at the time; but you had to pass it to Cowper.</t231>
<t232>—No, Mom, not even Cowper is capable of cheering him up.</t232><t233>..!</t233> <t234>But we must admit that there are differences in taste.</t234> <t235>Elinor does not share my way of feeling, so she can overlook those things and be happy with him.</t235> <t236>But if I loved him, it would have broken my heart to hear him read with so little sensitivity.</t236> <t237>Mom, the more I know the world, the more convinced I am that I will never find a man whom I can truly love.</t237> <t238>Is it so much to ask?</t238> <t239>He must have all of Edward's virtues, and his appearance and manners must adorn his goodness with all possible graces.</t239>
<t240>—Remember, my love, that you are not yet seventeen years old.</t240> <t241>It is still too early in life for you to despair of achieving such happiness.</t241> <t242>Why should you be less fortunate than your mother?</t242> <t243>May it be that in only one circumstance, my Marianne, your fate is different from hers!</t243>
<t244>CHAPTER IV</t244>
<t245>—What a pity, Elinor —said Marianne—, that Edward lacks taste for drawing.</t245>
<t246>—That he lacks taste for drawing... and what makes you think that? —replied Elinor—.</t246> <t247>He doesn't draw, it's true, but he greatly enjoys watching others draw and, I can assure you, he is by no means lacking in natural good taste, although he hasn't had the opportunity to improve it.</t247> <t248>If he had ever had the chance to learn, I believe he would have drawn very well.</t248> <t249>He distrusts his own judgment in these matters so much that he is always reluctant to give his opinion on any painting; but he has an innate fineness and simplicity of taste that, in general, guides him perfectly adequately.</t249>
<t250>Marianne was afraid of being offensive and said nothing more about the subject; but the kind of approval that, according to Elinor, his drawings of other People elicited in him was far from the ecstatic delight that, in her opinion, was the only one deserving to be called taste.</t250> <t251>Nevertheless, and although smiling to herself at the mistake, she paid tribute to her sister for that blind predilection for Edward that led her to thus err.</t251>
<t252>"I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "that you do not consider him generally lacking in taste."</t252> <t253>"In truth, I believe I can say that you do not think so, because your behavior towards him is perfectly cordial; and if that were your opinion, I am sure you would not be able to be attentive to him."</t253>
<t254>Marianne almost didn't know what to say.</t254> <t255>For no reason did she want to hurt her sister's feelings, but it was impossible for her to say something she didn't believe.</t255> <t256>Finally, she responded:</t256>
<t257>—Do not be offended, Elinor, if the praises I may offer of Edward do not entirely match your perception of his merits.</t257> <t258>I have not had as many opportunities as you to appreciate even the smallest tendencies of his mind, his inclinations, his tastes; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his kindness and good sense.</t258> <t259>I believe him to possess everything that is valuable and amiable.</t259>
<t260>—I am sure —Elinor replied with a smile— that his dearest friends would not be dissatisfied with such praise.</t260> <t261>I can't imagine how you could express yourself with more warmth.</t261>
<t262>Marianne rejoiced to see how easily her sister was contented.</t262>
<t263>—Of his good sense and kindness —continued Elinor—, I think that no one who has seen him enough to have conversed with him without reservations could doubt.</t263> <t264>Only that shyness which so often leads him to remain silent may have concealed the excellence of his understanding and his principles.</t264> <t265>You know him well enough to do justice to the solidity of his worth.</t265> <t266>But of his slightest tendencies, as you call them, specific circumstances have kept you more ignorant than me.</t266> <t267>On various occasions, he and I have stayed together for a long time, while you, driven by the most affectionate of impulses, have been completely absorbed by my mother.</t267> <t268>I have seen him a lot, studied his feelings, and listened to his opinions on topics of literature and taste; and, in general, I dare to say that he has a cultivated mind, that the pleasure he finds in books is extremely great, his imagination is lively, his observations are just and correct, and his taste is delicate and pure.</t268> <t269>When he is known better, his qualities improve in all areas, as do his manners and appearance.</t269> <t270>It is true that, at first glance, his demeanor does not produce great admiration and his appearance hardly leads one to call him handsome, until one notices the expression of his eyes, which are extraordinarily kind, and the general sweetness of his countenance.</t270> <t271>At present, I know him so well that I truly believe him to be handsome; or, at least, almost.</t271> <t272>What do you say, Marianne?</t272>
<t273>—Very soon I will consider him handsome, Elinor, if I do not already.</t273> <t274>When you tell me to love him like a brother, I will no longer see imperfections in his face, just as I see none in his heart today.</t274>
<t275>Elinor was startled by this declaration and regretted having allowed herself to be betrayed by the heat of her words.</t275> <t276>She felt that Edward held a very high place in her affections.</t276> <t277>She believed that the interest was mutual, but required greater certainty in this regard to accept Marianne's conviction about their relationship with pleasure.</t277> <t278>She knew that a conjecture Marianne and her mother made at one moment would turn into certainty the next; that, with them, desire was hope and hope was expectation.</t278> <t279>She tried to explain to her sister the true state of the situation.</t279>
<t280>—It is not my intention to deny —he said— that I have a high opinion of him; that I esteem him deeply, that I like him.</t280>
<t281>Faced with this, Marianne burst out indignantly.</t281>
<t282>—Esteem him! Like him! Elinor, what a cold heart you have.</t282> <t283>Ah, worse than cold!</t283> <t284>Not daring to be otherwise.</t284> <t285>Use those words again, and I will leave this room immediately.</t285>
<t286>Elinor couldn't help but laugh.</t286>
<t287>—Forgive me —he said to her—, and you can be sure that it was not my intention to offend you by referring to my own feelings with such measured words.</t287> <t288>Believe them to be stronger than what I have declared; believe them, in short, to be what Edward's merits and the presumption... the hope of his affection for me could guarantee, without imprudence or madness.</t288> <t289>But more than this you should not believe.</t289> <t290>I have no certainty of his affection for me.</t290> <t291>There are moments when it seems doubtful to what extent such affection exists; and as long as I do not fully know his feelings, you cannot be surprised by my desire to avoid giving wings to my own inclination by believing it or calling it more than it is.</t291> <t292>In the deepest part of my heart, I have few, almost no doubts about his preferences.</t292> <t293>But there are other points that must be taken into account, besides his interest.</t293> <t294>He is far from being independent.</t294> <t295>We cannot know what his mother is really like; but Fanny's occasional remarks about her behavior and opinions have never led us to consider her kind; and I am very mistaken if Edward is not also aware of the various difficulties he would encounter if he wished to marry a woman who was not either of great fortune or high rank.</t295>
<t296>Marianne was astonished to discover to what extent her mother's imagination and her own had gone beyond the truth.</t296>
<t297>—And indeed you are not engaged to him! —he said—.</t297> <t298>Although it will happen eventually anyway.</t298> <t299>But this delay has two advantages.</t299> <t300>I will not lose you so soon and Edward will have more opportunities to improve that natural taste for your favorite occupation, so indispensable for your future happiness.</t300> <t301>Ah!</t301> <t302>If your genius led him to learn to draw as well, how delightful it would be!</t302>
<t303>Elinor had given her true opinion to her sister.</t303> <t304>She could not consider her inclination for Edward under the favorable prospects that Marianne had supposed.</t304> <t305>There was, at times, a lack of spirit in him that, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost equally unpromising.</t305> <t306>If he had doubts about the affection she professed for him, assuming he had them, it should cause him nothing but uneasiness.</t306> <t307>It did not seem possible that they caused that dejection of spirit that often overcame him.</t307> <t308>A more reasonable cause could be found in his situation of dependency, which barred him from giving himself to his affections.</t308> <t309>She knew that the treatment his mother gave him did not provide him with a comfortable home at present nor gave him any assurance that he could form a home of his own, unless he strictly adhered to the ideas she held about the importance he should achieve.</t309> <t310>Knowing this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel at ease.</t310> <t311>She was far from trusting in that outcome of Edward's preferences that his mother and sister took for granted.</t311> <t312>No, the more time they spent together, the more doubtful the nature of his affection seemed to her; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it was nothing more than simple friendship.</t312>
<t313>But, whatever its actual limits were, that affection was sufficient, as soon as Edward's sister perceived it, to unsettle her; —and at the same time (which was even more usual), to bring out her bad manners.</t313> <t314>She seized the first opportunity she found to offend her mother-in-law by speaking so expressively about the great expectations they had for her brother, about Mrs. Ferrars' decision regarding her two children marrying well, and about the danger that awaited any young woman who wanted to win him over, that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend not to notice nor attempt to remain calm.</t314> <t315>She gave a response that revealed her disdain and immediately left the room, while making the decision that whatever the inconveniences or expenses of such a sudden departure, her dearly beloved Elinor should not be exposed to such insinuations for even one more week.</t315>
<t316>In this state of mind, she received a letter by mail with a particularly timely proposal.</t316> <t317>A distinguished gentleman and owner of important properties in Devonshire, a relative of hers, offered her a small house on very convenient terms.</t317> <t318>The letter, signed by him, was written in a friendly and helpful tone.</t318> <t319>He understood that she needed accommodation, and although what he was now offering her was a simple country house, a cottage of his own, he assured her that everything she thought necessary would be done if she liked the location.</t319> <t320>He urged her insistently, after describing the house and garden in detail, to go to Barton Park, where his own residence was, and from where she could judge for herself if the cottage at Barton—because both houses belonged to the same parish—could be arranged to her convenience.</t320> <t321>He seemed genuinely anxious to accommodate them, and his entire letter was written in such a friendly style that it could not help but please his cousin, especially at a time when she was suffering from the cold and insensitive behavior of her closest relatives.</t321> <t322>She needed no time for deliberations or consultations.</t322> <t323>Along with reading the letter, she made her decision.</t323> <t324>The location of Barton in a county as distant from Sussex as Devonshire, something that just a few hours earlier would have been a sufficient objection to counteract all the possible merits of the place, was now its main advantage.</t324> <t325>Leaving the neighborhood of Norland no longer seemed a bad thing; it was an object of desire, a blessing compared to the misery of continuing to be a guest of her daughter-in-law.</t325> <t326>And moving away forever from that beloved place was going to be less painful than living in it or visiting it while that woman was its mistress and lady.</t326> <t327>She immediately wrote to Sir John Middleton expressing her gratitude for his kindness and accepting his proposal; then she hurried to show both letters to her daughters, ensuring their approval before sending them.</t327>
<t328>Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland rather than among their current acquaintances, so she did not oppose her mother's intentions to move to Devonshire.</t328> <t329>The house, moreover, as described by Sir John, was of such simple dimensions and the rent so remarkably moderate, that she had no right to object in any way; and thus, although it was not a plan that attracted her fancy and although it meant a departure from the vicinity of Norland that exceeded her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from writing to accept the offer.</t329>
<t330>CHAPTER V</t330>
<t331>As soon as her response was dispatched, Mrs. Dashwood allowed herself the pleasure of announcing to her stepson and his wife that she had secured a house and would no longer inconvenience them except until everything was ready to move in.</t331> <t332>They listened to her with surprise.</t332> <t333>Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing, but her husband courteously expressed that he hoped they would not go far from Norland.</t333> <t334>With great satisfaction, Mrs. Dashwood replied that they were going to Devonshire.</t334> <t335>Edward quickly raised his eyes upon hearing this, and with a voice of surprise and concern that required no further explanation for Mrs. Dashwood, he repeated: “Devonshire!</t335> <t336>Are you really going there?</t336> <t337>So far from here! And to what part?”</t337> <t338>She explained the location to him.</t338> <t339>It was four miles north of Exeter.</t339>
<t340>—It is just a little country house —he continued—, but I hope to see many of my friends there.</t340> <t341>It will be easy to add one or two rooms; and if my friends do not find it difficult to travel so far to see me, surely I will not find it difficult to accommodate them.</t341>
<t342>She concluded with a very generous invitation to Mr. John Dashwood and his wife to visit her in Barton; and to Edward, she extended another with even greater affection.</t342> <t343>Although in her last conversation with her daughter-in-law, the latter's expressions had decided her not to remain in Norland any longer than was inevitable, they did not produce the effect they primarily aimed at: separating Edward and Elinor was as far from her objective as it had been before; and with that invitation to her brother, she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood how little importance she gave to her disapproval of that union.</t343>
<t344>Mr. John Dashwood repeatedly told his mother how deeply he regretted that she had taken a house at such a great distance from Norland, which would prevent him from offering his services for the transportation of her furniture.</t344> <t345>He was truly annoyed by the situation because it made impracticable that effort to which he had limited the fulfillment of his promise to his father.</t345> <t346>The belongings were sent by sea.</t346> <t347>They consisted mainly of linens, cutlery, crockery, and books, along with a beautiful piano belonging to Marianne.</t347> <t348>Mrs. John Dashwood watched the packages depart with a sigh; she couldn't help feeling that since Mrs. Dashwood's rent was going to be so insignificant compared to hers, she deserved to have any piece of furniture that was beautiful.</t348>
<t349>Mrs. Dashwood rented the house for a year; it was already furnished, and she could take possession of it immediately.</t349> <t350>None of the interested parties raised any objections to the agreement, and she only awaited the dispatch of her effects from Norland and the decision on her future domestic service before heading west; and this, given the extreme speed with which she carried out everything that interested her, was very soon accomplished.</t350> <t351>The horses her husband had left her had been sold after his death, and now having an opportunity to dispose of her carriage, she agreed to sell it at the urging of her eldest daughter.</t351> <t352>If it had depended on her own wishes, she would have kept it, for the greater comfort of her daughters; but Elinor's good judgment prevailed.</t352> <t353>It was also her wisdom that limited the number of servants to three, two maids and one man, promptly selected from those who had been part of her service at Norland.</t353>
<t354>The man and one of the maids immediately set off to Devonshire to prepare the house for the arrival of their mistress, for since Mrs. Dashwood was completely unfamiliar with Lady Middleton, she preferred to go directly to the cottage rather than stay at Barton Park; and she trusted so much in the description that Sir John had given of the house that she did not feel curious to examine it for herself until she entered it as its owner.</t354> <t355>The evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law at the prospect of her departure, barely concealed behind a cold invitation to stay a while longer, kept her anxiety to leave Norland intact.</t355> <t356>Now was the moment when John Dashwood's promise to his father could have been fulfilled with particular appropriateness.</t356> <t357>As he had neglected to do so upon arriving at the house, the moment when they were leaving it seemed the most suitable for it.</t357> <t358>But very soon Mrs. Dashwood abandoned all hope in this regard and began to convince herself, by the general sense of his words, that his help would go no further than having kept them at Norland for six months.</t358> <t359>So often did he refer to the increasing household expenses and the constant and incalculable monetary demands to which any gentleman of some importance was exposed, that he seemed more in need of money than willing to give it.</t359>
<t360>Very few weeks after the day that brought the first letter from Sir John Middleton to Norland, all the arrangements for their future accommodation were so advanced that Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were able to begin their journey.</t360>
<t361>Many were the tears they shed in their final farewells to a place they had loved so much.</t361>
<t362>—Dear, dear Norland! —repeated Marianne as she wandered alone in front of the house the last evening they were there—.</t362> <t363>When will I stop missing you?; when will I learn to feel any other place as home?</t363> <t364>Ah, blessed house!</t364> <t365>How could you know what I suffer seeing you now from this place, from where I may never see you again!</t365> <t366>And you, trees that are so familiar to me!</t366> <t367>But you, you will remain the same.</t367> <t368>No leaf will wither because we leave, no branch will stop swaying even if we can no longer see them.</t368> <t369>No, you will remain the same, unaware of the pleasure or pain you cause and insensitive to any change in those who walk under your shadows.</t369> <t370>And, who will be left to enjoy you?</t370>
<t371>CHAPTER VI</t371>
<t372>The first part of the journey passed amidst such a melancholic mood that it could only result in being tedious and unpleasant.</t372> <t373>But as they approached their destination, the interest in the appearance of the region where they were to live overcame their despondency, and the sight of Barton Valley as they entered it filled them with joy.</t373> <t374>It was a pleasant, fertile region, with large forests and rich pastures.</t374> <t375>After traveling more than a mile, they arrived at their own house.</t375> <t376>In the front, a small green garden constituted the entirety of their domain, which a neat iron gate allowed them to enter.</t376>
<t377>As a dwelling, Barton's little house, although small, was comfortable and solid; but as a country house, it was flawed because the construction was regular, the roof had tiles, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered with honeysuckle.</t377> <t378>A narrow corridor led directly through the house to the back garden.</t378> <t379>On either side of the entrance, there was a sitting room of approximately sixteen square feet; and then there were the service quarters and the stairs.</t379> <t380>Four bedrooms and two attics made up the rest of the house.</t380> <t381>It had not been built many years ago and was in good condition.</t381> <t382>Compared to Norland, it was certainly small and poor!</t382> <t383>But the tears that the memories brought forth upon entering the house soon dried up.</t383> <t384>They were cheered by the joy of the servants upon their arrival, and each one, thinking of the others, decided to appear content.</t384> <t385>September had just begun, the weather was beautiful, and from the first view they had of the place under the advantages of good weather, the favorable impression they received was of paramount importance for it to earn their firmest approval.</t385>
<t386>The location of the house was good.</t386> <t387>Behind it, and not far to either side, rose high hills, some of which were open slopes, the others cultivated and wooded.</t387> <t388>The village of Barton was situated almost entirely on one of these hills, and offered a pleasant view from the cottage windows.</t388> <t389>The view to the front was broader; it encompassed the entire valley, and even the fields into which it opened.</t389> <t390>The hills surrounding the cottage enclosed the valley in that direction; but under another name, and with another course, it opened again between two of the steepest mountains.</t390>
<t391>Mrs. Dashwood generally felt satisfied with the size and furnishings of the house, for although her former lifestyle made it essential to improve it in many aspects, it was always a pleasure for her to expand and perfect things; and at that moment she had enough money to give the rooms all the greater elegance they required.</t391>
<t392>—As for the house itself —he said—, it is certainly too small for our family; but we will be acceptably comfortable for the moment, as it is too late in the year to make improvements.</t392> <t393>Perhaps in the spring, if I have enough money, as I dare say I will, we can think about building.</t393> <t394>These two rooms are too small for the groups of friends I hope to see often gathered here; and I have the idea of incorporating the corridor into one of them, with perhaps part of the other, and thus leaving the rest of that other as a hallway; this, along with a new room, which can be easily added, and a bedroom and an attic upstairs, will make it a very cozy little house.</t394> <t395>I could wish the stairs were more attractive.</t395> <t396>But you can't expect everything, although I suppose it wouldn't be difficult to enlarge them.</t396> <t397>I'll see how much I owe the world when spring arrives, and we'll plan our improvements accordingly:</t397>
<t398>Meanwhile, until a woman who had never economized in her life could carry out all these changes with the savings from an income of five hundred pounds a year, they wisely contented themselves with the house as it was; and each of them took care and endeavored to organize their own affairs, distributing their books and other possessions to make the house a home.</t398> <t399>They unpacked Marianne's piano and placed it in the most suitable spot, and hung Elinor's drawings on the walls of the living room.</t399>
<t400>The next day, just after finishing breakfast, they were interrupted in their activities by the entrance of the owner of the cabin, who came to welcome them to Barton and offer them anything from his own house and garden that they might be lacking at the moment.</t400><t401>Sir John Middleton was a handsome man of about forty years old.</t401><t402>He had previously visited Stanhill, but it had been too long ago for his young cousins to remember him.</t402><t403>His countenance revealed good humor and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter.</t403><t404>It seemed that the arrival of his relatives filled him with real satisfaction and that their comfort was a matter of genuine concern for him.</t404><t405>He elaborated on his deep desire for both families to live on the most cordial terms and exhorted them so kindly to dine at Barton Park every day until they were better settled in their home, that although he insisted on his invitations to a point that surpassed good manners, it was impossible to feel offended by it.</t405><t406>His kindness was not limited to words, for within an hour of his departure, a large basket of vegetables and fruits arrived from the estate, followed before the end of the day by a gift of game animals.</t406><t407>Moreover, he insisted on taking all their letters to the post and bringing those that arrived for them, and he refused to be deprived of the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper daily.</t407>
<t408>Lady Middleton had sent him with a very courteous message, expressing her intention to visit Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be sure that her arrival would not be an inconvenience; and as this message received an equally attentive response, the next day they were introduced to her ladyship.</t408>
<t409>Of course, they were eager to see the person on whom so much of their comfort in Barton would depend, and the elegance of her appearance impressed them favorably.</t409> <t410>Lady Middleton was no more than twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, had a beautiful face, a tall and striking figure, and graceful manners.</t410> <t411>Her manners had all the refinement that her husband lacked.</t411> <t412>But she could have benefited from some of his frankness and warmth.</t412> <t413>And her visit lasted long enough to somewhat diminish the initial admiration she had provoked, by showing that, although perfectly well-mannered, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most commonplace questions or observations.</t413>
<t414>There was no lack of conversation, however, because Sir John was very talkative and Lady Middleton had the wise precaution of bringing her eldest son with her, a handsome little boy of about six years old whose presence always provided a topic to fall back on in case of extreme urgency.</t414> <t415>They had to inquire about his name and age, admire his looks, and ask him questions, which his mother answered for him while he clung to her with his head down, much to her ladyship's surprise, who wondered why he was so shy around strangers when at home he could make quite a lot of noise.</t415> <t416>In all formal visits, there should be a child, as a safeguard for the conversation.</t416> <t417>In the current case, it took ten minutes to decide whether the child resembled the father or the mother more, and in what particular aspect he resembled each; because, of course, everyone disagreed and each was astonished at the opinions of the others.</t417>
<t418>Very soon the Dashwoods had a new opportunity to talk about the rest of the children, because Sir John did not leave the house without first making them promise to dine with them the next day.</t418>
<t419>CHAPTER VII</t419>
<t420>Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage.</t420> <t421>The Dashwoods had passed near it while crossing the valley, but from their home, they could not see it, as it was hidden by the projection of a hill.</t421> <t422>The house itself was spacious and beautiful, and the Middletons lived in a manner that combined hospitality and elegance.</t422> <t423>The former was for the satisfaction of Sir John, the latter for that of his wife.</t423> <t424>There was almost always a friend staying with them in the house, and they received more visitors of all kinds than any other family in the vicinity.</t424> <t425>This was necessary for the happiness of both, given that despite their different characters and behaviors, they were extremely similar in their total lack of talent and taste, a deficiency that limited to a very narrow range the occupations not related to social life.</t425> <t426>Sir John was devoted to sports, Lady Middleton to motherhood.</t426> <t427>He hunted and practiced shooting, she indulged her children; and these were their only resources.</t427> <t428>Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to pamper her children all year round, whereas Sir John's independent pursuits could only occupy him for half the time.</t428> <t429>Nevertheless, continuous engagements at home and away from it made up for all the deficiencies of their nature and education, sustained Sir John's good spirits, and allowed his wife to exercise her good breeding.</t429>
<t430>Lady Middleton prided herself on the elegance of her table and all her domestic arrangements, and from this kind of vanity she derived the greatest satisfactions in all her gatherings.</t430> <t431>In contrast, Sir John's taste for social life was much more genuine; he enjoyed gathering around him more young people than could fit in his house, and the noisier it was, the greater his pleasure.</t431> <t432>He was a blessing to all the youth in the neighborhood, as in summer he constantly gathered groups of people to eat ham and cold chicken outdoors, and in winter his private dances were numerous enough for any girl who had already outgrown the insatiable appetite of fifteen.</t432>
<t433>The arrival of a new family in the region was always a cause for joy for him, and from every point of view, he was delighted with the tenants he had secured for his cottage in Barton.</t433> <t434>The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and simple, with unaffected manners.</t434> <t435>That was enough to ensure his good opinion, because the lack of affectation was all that a pretty girl needed to make her spirit as captivating as her appearance.</t435> <t436>It pleased Sir John in his friendly nature to have the opportunity to do a favor for those whose situation could be considered adverse compared to what they had in the past.</t436> <t437>Thus, his acts of kindness towards his cousins satisfied his good heart; and by establishing a family composed solely of women in the Barton cottage, he obtained all the pleasures of a sportsman; because a sportsman, although he only esteems the representatives of his sex who are also sportsmen, is rarely eager to foster their tastes by lodging them in his own preserve.</t437>
<t438>Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were received at the door of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with spontaneous sincerity; and as he guided them to the drawing-room, he repeated to the young ladies the concern that the same subject had caused him the day before, that is, not being able to find any elegant and witty young men to introduce to them.</t438> <t439>There would only be one other gentleman besides himself, he told them; a very special friend who was staying at the estate, but who was neither very young nor very cheerful.</t439> <t440>He hoped they would excuse the small number of attendees and assured them that it would not happen again.</t440> <t441>He had been with several families that morning, hoping to find someone else to make the group larger, but there was a full moon and everyone was full of commitments for that night.</t441> <t442>Fortunately, Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton at the last minute, and since she was a very cheerful and pleasant woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find the gathering as boring as they might imagine.</t442> <t443>The young ladies, like their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two completely unknown people among the attendees, and desired no more.</t443>
<t444>Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was an elderly woman of excellent humor, plump and cheerful, who talked a lot, seemed very happy, and somewhat vulgar.</t444> <t445>She was full of jokes and laughter, and before the end of dinner, she had repeatedly showcased her wit on the subject of lovers and husbands; she had expressed her hopes that the young ladies had not left their hearts in Sussex, and each time she pretended to have seen them blush, whether they had or not.</t445> <t446>Marianne was annoyed by this on account of her sister and, to see how she endured these attacks, looked at Elinor with an anxiety that caused her much greater discomfort than the trivial jests of Mrs. Jennings could ever produce.</t446>
<t447>Colonel Brandon, Sir John's friend, with his quiet and serious manners, seemed as little suitable to be his friend as Lady Middleton to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother.</t447> <t448>His appearance, however, was not unpleasant, despite the fact that in Marianne and Margaret's opinion he was a hopeless bachelor, because he had already passed thirty-five and entered the faded zone of life; but although he was not handsome, there was intelligence in his countenance and a particular chivalry in his demeanor.</t448>
<t449>Nobody in the gathering had anything that recommended them as company for the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly unpleasant that, compared to her, the gravity of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous cheerfulness of Sir John and his mother-in-law, were interesting.</t449> <t450>Lady Middleton's cheerfulness only seemed to emerge after dinner with the entrance of her four noisy children, who pulled her here and there, tore her clothes, and put an end to all conversation except that concerning them.</t450>
<t451>In the evening, as it was discovered that Marianne had musical talents, she was invited to play.</t451> <t452>They opened the instrument, everyone prepared to be delighted, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went through most of the songs that Lady Middleton had brought to the family upon marrying, and which perhaps had remained in the same position on the piano since then, as her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music, although according to her mother she played extremely well and, according to herself, was very fond of doing so.</t452>
<t453>Marianne's performance was highly applauded.</t453> <t454>Sir John loudly expressed his admiration at the end of each piece, and equally loud was his conversation with others while the song lasted.</t454> <t455>Lady Middleton often called him to order, surprised that anyone could distract their attention from the music even for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song that she had just finished.</t455> <t456>Only Colonel Brandon, among the entire audience, listened to her without outbursts.</t456> <t457>His only compliment was listening to her, and at that moment she felt for him a respect that the others had rightly lost due to their shameless lack of taste.</t457> <t458>The pleasure that the Colonel had shown towards the music, although it did not reach that ecstasy which, to the exclusion of any other, she considered compatible with her own delight, was worthy of appreciation in the face of the horrible insensitivity of the rest; and she was sensible enough to concede that a man of thirty-five years could well have left behind in his life all sharpness of feelings and every exquisite faculty of enjoyment.</t458> <t459>She was perfectly willing to make all the necessary concessions to the Colonel's advanced age that a humanitarian spirit would demand.</t459>
<t460>CHAPTER VIII</t460>
<t461>In her widowhood, Mrs. Jennings had come into possession of a generous income from the usufruct of the properties left by her husband.</t461> <t462>She only had two daughters, whom she had seen respectably married, and therefore now had nothing to do but marry off the rest of the world.</t462> <t463>As far as she was able, she was zealously active in the fulfillment of this objective and did not miss an opportunity to plan marriages among the young people she knew.</t463> <t464>She was remarkably quick to discover who was attracted to whom, and had enjoyed the merit of causing many young ladies to blush and feel vain with insinuations regarding their power over this or that young man; and barely arrived at Barton, this kind of insight allowed her to announce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood.</t464> <t465>Rather, she suspected it was so the very first evening they were together, by the attention with which he listened to her sing; and when the Middletons returned the visit and dined at the cottage, she confirmed it by seeing again how he listened to her.</t465> <t466>It had to be so.</t466> <t467>She was totally convinced of it.</t467> <t468>It would be an excellent match, for he was rich and she was beautiful.</t468> <t469>From the very moment she had met Colonel Brandon, due to his ties with Sir John, Mrs. Jennings had longed to see him well married; and moreover, she never wavered in her eagerness to find a good husband for every pretty girl.</t469>
<t470>The immediate advantage she gained from it was by no means insignificant, because it provided her with endless jokes at the expense of both.</t470> <t471>At Barton Park, she laughed at the colonel, and at the cottage, at Marianne.</t471> <t472>To the former, those jests were probably completely indifferent, as they only affected him; but for the latter, at first they were incomprehensible; and when she understood their object, she did not know whether to laugh at how absurd they were or to censure their impertinence, as she considered them an insensitive comment on the colonel's advanced years and his sad condition as a bachelor.</t472>
<t473>Mrs. Dashwood, who could not consider a man five years younger than herself to be as excessively old as he appeared to her daughter's youthful imagination, tried to clear Mrs. Jennings of the charge of having wanted to ridicule his age.</t473>
<t474>—But, Mom, at least you can't deny the absurdity of the accusation, even if you don't believe it to be intentionally malicious.</t474> <t475>Of course Colonel Brandon is younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be my father; and if he ever had the inclination to fall in love, he must have forgotten what it feels like by now.</t475> <t476>It's too ridiculous!</t476> <t477>When will a man be able to free himself from such notions, if age and his frailty do not protect him?</t477>
<t478>—Weakness! —exclaimed Elinor—.</t478> <t479>Do you call Colonel Brandon weak?</t479> <t480>I can easily suppose that to you his age seems much older than to my mother, but it is hard to be mistaken about the fact that he is indeed in use of his limbs.</t480>
<t481>Didn't you hear him complain about rheumatism?</t481> <t482>And isn't that the first weakness of a life that is declining?</t482>
<t483>—My dear girl! —said the mother, laughing—, then you must be in constant fear that I have also entered into decline; and it must seem a miracle to you that my life has reached the advanced age of forty years.</t483>
<t484>—Mom, you are not being fair to me.</t484> <t485>I know perfectly well that Colonel Brandon is not so old that his friends fear losing him to natural causes.</t485> <t486>He could live twenty more years.</t486> <t487>But thirty-five years have nothing to do with marriage.</t487>
<t488>—Perhaps —said Elinor—, it is better that a person of thirty-five and another of seventeen have nothing to do with a marriage between them.</t488> <t489>But if by chance it were a single woman at twenty-seven, I don't think the fact that Colonel Brandon is thirty-five would raise any objection to her marrying him.</t489>
<t490>—A woman of twenty-seven —said Marianne, after a small pause— could never expect to feel or inspire affection again; and if her home is not comfortable, or her fortune is small, I suppose she might try to content herself with taking up the profession of a governess, in order to obtain the Security that a wife enjoys.</t490> <t491>Therefore, if the colonel were to marry a woman in that condition, there would be nothing inappropriate.</t491> <t492>It would be a marriage of convenience and the world would be satisfied.</t492> <t493>In my eyes, it would not be a marriage at all, but that does not matter.</t493> <t494>To me, it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which each one would seek to benefit at the expense of the other.</t494>
<t495>—I know —said Elinor— that it would be impossible to convince you that a woman of twenty-seven could feel for a man of thirty-five something that even remotely resembles that love which would make him a desirable companion for her.</t495> <t496>But I must object to you condemning Colonel Brandon and his wife to perpetual confinement in a sickroom, simply because yesterday (a very cold and damp day) he happened to complain of a slight rheumatic sensation in one of his shoulders.</t496>
<t497>—But he mentioned flannel shirts —said Marianne—; and to me, a flannel shirt is invariably associated with aches, cramps, rheumatism, and all the ailments that can afflict the elderly and weak.</t497>
<t498>—If only he had been suffering from a violent fever, you wouldn't have looked down on him so much.</t498> <t499>Admit it, Marianne, don't you feel there's something interesting about the flushed cheeks, sunken eyes, and rapid pulse of a fever?</t499>
<t500>Shortly after, when Elinor had left the room, Marianne said:</t500>
<t501>—Mom, I have a concern about this matter of illnesses that I cannot hide from you.</t501> <t502>I am sure that Edward Ferrars is not well.</t502> <t503>We have been here for nearly fifteen days and he still hasn't come.</t503> <t504>Only a true indisposition could cause this extraordinary delay.</t504> <t505>What else could be keeping him in Norland?</t505>
<t506>—Did you think he would come so soon? —said Mrs. Dashwood—.</t506> <t507>I didn't.</t507> <t508>On the contrary, if I have ever felt anxious about it, it has been because I remembered that sometimes he showed a certain lack of pleasure at my invitation and little willingness to accept when I mentioned his coming to Barton.</t508> <t509>Does Elinor expect him already?</t509>
<t510>—I have never mentioned it to her, but of course, she must be expecting it.</t510>
<t511>—I think you're mistaken, because when I talked to him yesterday about getting a new grate for the guest room fireplace, he mentioned that there was no urgency, as if the room wasn't going to be occupied for some time.</t511>
<t512>—How strange all this is! What can it mean?</t512> <t513>But everything in the way they have treated each other has been inexplicable!</t513> <t514>How cold, how formal was their last goodbye!</t514> <t515>How lackluster their conversation was the last evening they were together!</t515> <t516>When saying goodbye, Edward made no distinction between Elinor and me: to both of us, he gave the good wishes of an affectionate brother.</t516> <t517>Twice I left them alone on purpose the last morning, and each time, in the most inexplicable manner, he followed me out of the room.</t517> <t518>And Elinor, upon leaving Norland and Edward, did not cry as I did.</t518> <t519>Even now her self-control is unwavering.</t519> <t520>When is she downcast or melancholy?</t520> <t521>When does she try to avoid the company of others, or seem restless and dissatisfied with herself?</t521>
<t522>CHAPTER IX</t522>
<t523>The Dashwoods were now settled in Barton with quite a bit of comfort.</t523> <t524>The house and garden, with all the objects surrounding them, were already familiar to them; little by little they resumed the daily activities that had given half their charm to Norland, but this time with much greater pleasure than they had achieved there since their father's death.</t524> <t525>Sir John Middleton, who visited them daily during the first fifteen days and was not accustomed to seeing too many chores in his home, could not hide his astonishment at always finding them occupied.</t525>
<t526>Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many.</t526> <t527>Despite Sir John's peremptory pleas for them to integrate more into the neighborhood and having assured them repeatedly that his carriage was always at their disposal, Mrs. Dashwood's independent spirit overcame her desire for a social life for her daughters; and with great determination, she refused to visit any family whose house was at a greater distance than could be covered by walking.</t527> <t528>There were few that met such a requirement, and not all of them were accessible.</t528> <t529>Approximately a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow and winding Allenham valley, which branched off from Barton as already described, in one of their early walks, the girls had discovered a respectable-looking mansion that, reminding them a bit of Norland, sparked interest in their imaginations and made them wish to know it better.</t529> <t530>But to their inquiries, they were told that its owner, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately too weak to mingle with the rest of the world and never left her home.</t530>
<t531>In general, the surroundings abounded with beautiful walks.</t531> <t532>The high hills, which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek in their summits the exquisite pleasure of the air, were a happy alternative when the dust of the valleys below concealed their superior charms; and towards one of those hills Marianne and Margaret directed their steps one memorable morning, attracted by the little sun that peeked through a showery sky and unable to endure any longer the confinement to which they had been subjected by the continuous rain of the previous two days.</t532> <t533>The weather was not so tempting as to tear the other two away from their pencils and books, despite Marianne's declaration that the good weather would hold and that even the last of the threatening clouds would move away from the hills.</t533> <t534>And together the two girls set off.</t534>
<t535>Cheerfully they ascended the hills, rejoicing in their own clairvoyance each time they glimpsed a piece of blue sky; and when they received on their faces the invigorating gusts of a penetrating southwest wind, they regretted the fears that had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.</t535>
<t536>—Is there in the world —said Marianne— a happiness comparable to this?</t536> <t537>Margaret, we will walk here for at least two hours.</t537>
<t538>Margaret agreed, and they resumed their journey against the wind, resisting it with cheerful laughter for almost twenty more minutes, when suddenly the clouds gathered above their heads and an intense rain soaked their faces.</t538> <t539>Saddened and surprised, they were forced, albeit reluctantly, to turn back, because there was no shelter closer than their home.</t539> <t540>Nevertheless, they had one consolation, which they could resort to at that moment since necessity gave them more decorum than they would usually have: and this was to run down as fast as they could the slope of the hill that led directly to their garden gate.</t540>
<t541>They set off.</t541> <t542>Marianne took the lead at the beginning, but a misstep suddenly made her fall to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop to help her, involuntarily continued at full speed and reached the bottom safe and sound.</t542>
<t543>A gentleman carrying a shotgun, with two pointer dogs playing around him, was climbing the hill and a few yards from Marianne when the accident happened.</t543> <t544>He left his weapon and ran to her aid.</t544> <t545>She had gotten up from the ground, but having twisted an ankle in the fall, she could barely stand.</t545> <t546>The gentleman offered his services, and noticing that her modesty made her refuse what her situation necessitated, he lifted her in his arms without further delay and carried her down the hill.</t546> <t547>Then, crossing the garden whose gate Margaret had left open, he carried her directly into the house, where Margaret had just arrived, and did not let go of her until he seated her in a chair in the sitting room.</t547>
<t548>Elinor and her mother rose in astonishment upon seeing him enter, and while they fixed their gaze on him with evident surprise and at the same time with secret admiration for his appearance, he excused his intrusion by explaining what had caused it; and he did so in such a frank and graceful manner that his voice and expression seemed to enhance his charms, although he was already extraordinarily handsome.</t548> <t549>If he had been old, ugly, and vulgar, he would still have earned Mrs. Dashwood's gratitude and kindness for any act of attention towards her daughter; but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance lent a new interest to his action, which moved her even more.</t549>
<t550>She thanked him again and again, and with the sweetness of manner that was her own, invited him to sit down.</t550> <t551>But he declined to do so, considering that he was dirty and wet.</t551> <t552>Mrs. Dashwood then begged him to tell her to whom she should be grateful.</t552> <t553>His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his home at that moment was in Allenham, from where he hoped she would allow him the honor of visiting them the next day to find out how Miss Dashwood was doing.</t553> <t554>The honor was quickly granted and he departed, becoming even more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.</t554>
<t555>His manly beauty and more than common grace instantly became the subject of widespread admiration, and the laughter at Marianne's expense, which his gallantry had aroused, received particular encouragement from his external attractions.</t555> <t556>Marianne herself had seen less of his appearance than the rest, because the confusion that reddened her face when he lifted her had prevented her from looking at him after they entered the house.</t556> <t557>But she had seen enough of him to join in the admiration of the others, and she did so with that energy that always adorned her praises.</t557> <t558>In appearance and demeanor, he was exactly what her imagination had always attributed to the hero of her favorite tales; and having carried her home with so little prior formality revealed a quickness of thought that very particularly awakened in her a favorable disposition towards him.</t558> <t559>All the circumstances pertaining to him made him interesting.</t559> <t560>He had a good name, his residence was in the village they preferred above all others, and very soon Marianne discovered that of all men's attire, the most becoming was a hunting jacket.</t560> <t561>Her imagination was bubbling, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a twisted ankle lost all importance.</t561>
<t562>That morning, Sir John came to visit them as soon as the next spell of good weather allowed him to leave the house.</t562> <t563>After recounting Marianne's accident, they anxiously asked him if he knew a gentleman named Willoughby in Allenham.</t563>
<t564>—Willoughby! —exclaimed Sir John—.</t564> <t565>Is he here?</t565> <t566>But what good news; I will ride to his house tomorrow to invite him to dinner on Thursday.</t566>
<t567>Do you know him, then? —asked Mrs. Dashwood.</t567>
<t568>—Know him!</t568> <t569>Of course I do.</t569> <t570>But he comes every year!</t570>
<t571>—And what kind of young person is he?</t571>
<t572>—I assure you, a person as good as any other.</t572> <t573>A fairly decent shooter, and there is no bolder rider in all of England.</t573>
<t574>—And that's all you can say about him! —exclaimed Marianne indignantly—.</t574> <t575>But, what are his manners like when you get to know him more intimately?</t575> <t576>What are his occupations, his talents, what is his spirit like?</t576>
<t577>Sir John was somewhat confused.</t577>
<t578>—By my life —he said—, I don't know him well enough to know that.</t578> <t579>But he is a pleasant person, good-natured, and he has a black pointer dog that is the best I have seen.</t579> <t580>Was he with him today?</t580>
<t581>But Marianne was as incapable of satisfying her curiosity about the color of Mr. Willoughby's dog as he was of describing the nuances of the young man's mind.</t581>
<t582>—But who is he? —asked Elinor—.</t582> <t583>Where does he come from? Does he own a house in Allenham?</t583>
<t584>On this point, Sir John could inform them further, and he told them that Mr. Willoughby did not have personal properties in the region; that he resided there only while visiting the elderly lady of Allenham Court, to whom he was related and whose estate he would inherit.</t584> <t585>And he added:</t585>
<t586>—Yes, yes, it is worth catching him, I assure you, Miss Dashwood; he also owns a lovely property in Somersetshire; and if I were you, I wouldn't give him up to my younger sister despite all her stumbling downhill.</t586> <t587>Miss Marianne cannot expect to keep all the men.</t587> <t588>Brandon will get jealous if she isn't more careful.</t588>
<t589>—I don't think —said Mrs. Dashwood, with an amused smile— that any of my daughters will trouble Mr. Willoughby with attempts to catch him.</t589> <t590>It is not an occupation for which they have been raised.</t590> <t591>Men are very safe with us, no matter how rich they are.</t591> <t592>I am glad to know, however, from what you say, that he is a respectable young man and someone whose company will not be despised.</t592>
<t593>—I believe he is as good a person as anyone —repeated Sir John—.</t593> <t594>I remember last Christmas, at a small gathering at Barton Park, when he danced from eight until four without sitting down even once.</t594>
<t595>Really? —exclaimed Marianne, her eyes shining—.</t595> <t596>And with elegance, with spirit?</t596>
<t597>—Yes; and he was up again at eight, ready to go riding.</t597>
<t598>—That's what I like; that's how a young man should be.</t598> <t599>No matter what he is dedicated to, his commitment to what he does should know no moderation nor leave him any sense of fatigue.</t599>
<t600>—Yes, yes, I am seeing how it will be —said Sir John—, I see how it will be.</t600> <t601>You intend to rope him in now, without thinking about poor Brandon.</t601>
<t602>—That is an expression, Sir John —said Marianne heatedly— that I particularly dislike.</t602>
<t603>I abhor all the trite phrases used to demonstrate wit; and "to rope in a man," or "to make a conquest," are the most odious of all.</t603> <t604>They lean towards vulgarity and pettiness; and if they were ever considered well-constructed, time has long since destroyed all their cleverness.</t604>
<t605>Sir John did not understand much of this reproach, but he laughed as heartily as if he had, and then replied:</t605>
<t606>—Yes, yes, I dare say that you, one way or another, are going to make enough conquests.</t606> <t607>Poor Brandon!</t607> <t608>He's already quite taken with you, and I assure you he's well worth catching, despite all this rolling on the ground and twisting his ankles.</t608>
<t609>CHAPTER X</t609>
<t610>The protector of Marianne, according to the terms in which Margaret praised Willoughby with more elegance than precision, arrived at the house very early the next morning to inquire about her personally.</t610> <t611>He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with something more than courtesy: with a kindness inspired by Sir John's words and her own gratitude; and everything that took place during the visit led the young man to full assurance about the good sense, elegance, affectionate manners, and homely comfort of the family with whom he had become acquainted by accident.</t611> <t612>To be convinced of the personal charms that all displayed, he did not need a second interview.</t612>
<t613>Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure.</t613> <t614>Marianne was even more beautiful.</t614> <t615>Her silhouette, though not as correct as her sister's, had the advantage of height and was more striking; and her face was so charming that when in traditional panegyrics she was called a beautiful girl, it was less of an exaggeration than usual.</t615> <t616>Her complexion was very dark, but its transparency gave it an extraordinary glow; all her features were correct; her smile, sweet and attractive; and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness that could hardly be observed without pleasure.</t616> <t617>At first, she restrained the expressiveness of her gaze before Willoughby, due to the embarrassment caused by the memory of his help.</t617> <t618>But when this passed; when she regained control of her spirit; when she saw that to his perfect gentlemanly education he added frankness and vivacity; and, above all, when she heard him affirm that he was passionately fond of music and dancing, she gave him such a look of approval that with it she ensured that much of his conversation was directed at her—during the rest of his stay.</t618>
<t619>The only thing required to induce her to speak was to mention any of her favorite pastimes.</t619> <t620>She couldn't remain silent when these topics were touched upon, and she was neither shy nor reserved about discussing them.</t620> <t621>They quickly discovered that they shared a taste for dancing and music, and that this stemmed from a general similarity of judgment in everything concerning both activities.</t621> <t622>Encouraged by this to examine the young man's opinions more closely, Marianne proceeded to question him on the subject of books; she brought up her favorite authors, speaking of them with such rapture that any young man of twenty-five would have had to be truly insensitive not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works, no matter how little he had considered them before.</t622> <t623>Their tastes were extraordinarily similar.</t623> <t624>They both idolized the same books, the same passages; or, if any difference appeared or any objection arose from him, it lasted only until the young woman's strength of argument or the sparkle in her eyes could be displayed.</t624> <t625>He agreed with all her decisions, caught her enthusiasm, and long before the end of his visit, they conversed with the familiarity of long-time acquaintances.</t625>
<t626>—Well, Marianne —said Elinor immediately after her departure—, I think you have done quite well for a morning.</t626> <t627>You have already discovered Mr. Willoughby's opinion on almost all matters of importance.</t627> <t628>You are aware of what he thinks about Cowper and Scott; you have total certainty that he appreciates their charms as they should be, and you have received all the necessary assurances —regarding that he does not admire Pope more than is appropriate.</t628> <t629>But, how will you continue your relationship with him after dispatching in such an extraordinary manner all possible topics of conversation!</t629> <t630>Soon you will have exhausted all preferred topics.</t630> <t631>Another meeting will suffice for him to explain his feelings about picturesque beauty and second marriages, and then you will have nothing more to ask...</t631>
<t632>—Elinor! —exclaimed Marianne—.</t632> <t633>Are you being fair? Are you being equitable?</t633> <t634>Are my ideas so scarce?</t634> <t635>But I understand what you are saying.</t635> <t636>I have felt too comfortable, too happy, I have been too frank.</t636> <t637>I have neglected all the commonplaces related to decorum.</t637> <t638>I have been open and sincere where I should have been reserved, opaque, reluctant, and false.</t638> <t639>If I had only talked about the weather and the roads, and if I had only spoken once every ten minutes, I would have saved myself from this reproach.</t639>
<t640>—My dear —said her mother—, you must not feel offended by Elinor; she was only joking.</t640> <t641>I myself would scold her if I thought she was capable of wanting to curb the pleasure of your conversation with our new friend.</t641>
<t642>Marianne calmed down in an instant.</t642>
<t643>Willoughby, for his part, gave so many proofs of the pleasure he derived from their relationship as his evident desire to deepen it could offer.</t643> <t644>He visited them daily.</t644> <t645>At first, his excuse was to inquire about Marianne; but the encouraging manner in which he was received, which grew more gracious day by day, made such an excuse unnecessary before Marianne's full recovery rendered it impossible.</t645> <t646>She had to remain confined to the house for a few days, but no confinement had ever been less bothersome.</t646> <t647>Willoughby was a young man of great abilities, quick imagination, lively spirit, and frank and affectionate manners.</t647> <t648>He was exactly made to win Marianne's heart, for to all this he added not only a captivating appearance but a mind full of natural passion, which now awakened and grew with the example of hers and recommended him to her affection more than anything else.</t648>
<t649>Little by little, Willoughby's company became Marianne's most exquisite pleasure.</t649> <t650>Together they read, conversed, sang; the musical talents he displayed were considerable, and he read with all the sensitivity and enthusiasm that Edward had so lamentably lacked.</t650>
<t651>In Mrs. Dashwood's opinion, the young man appeared as faultless as he was to Marianne; and Elinor saw nothing in him worthy of censure except for a propensity—which made him extremely similar to his sister and which especially delighted her—to say too much of what he thought on every occasion, without paying attention to either people or circumstances.</t651> <t652>In forming and hastily giving his opinion about other people, in sacrificing general courtesy for the pleasure of devoting his full attention to what filled his heart, and in too easily overlooking social conventions, he showed a carelessness that Elinor could not approve of, despite everything he and Marianne said in favor of it.</t652>
<t653>Marianne was now beginning to realize that the despair which had seized her at sixteen and a half, at the thought that she would never meet a man who satisfied her ideas of perfection, had been hasty and unjustifiable.</t653> <t654>Willoughby was everything her imagination had conjured up in that unfortunate hour, and in each of her happiest times, as capable of attracting her; and in his behavior, he showed that his desires in such an aspect were as intense as his gifts were numerous.</t654>
<t655>Mrs. Dashwood too, in whose mind the future wealth of Willoughby had not sparked any speculation about a possible marriage between the young people, found herself, before the end of the week, being carried away by hopes and expectations, and secretly congratulating herself on having gained two sons-in-law like Edward and Willoughby.</t655>
<t656>The preference of Colonel Brandon for Marianne, so prematurely discovered by his friends, became perceptible to Elinor for the first time when they ceased to notice it.</t656> <t657>They began to direct their attention and wit to his more fortunate rival, and the jests of which the former had been the object before any particular interest had awakened in him, ceased to fall upon him when his feelings truly began to be deserving of that ridicule which so justly attaches to sensibility.</t657> <t658>Elinor was forced, though against her will, to believe that the feelings Mrs. Jennings had attributed to the Colonel for her own amusement had indeed been awakened by her sister; and that if a general affinity between the two could prompt Mr. Willoughby's affection for Marianne, an equally notable opposition of characters was no obstacle to Colonel Brandon's affection.</t658> <t659>She saw this with concern, for what hopes could a circumspect man of thirty-five have against a young man full of life of twenty-five?</t659> <t660>And as she could not even wish him the victor, with all her heart she wished him indifferent.</t660> <t661>She liked the Colonel; despite his gravity and reserve, she considered him worthy of interest.</t661> <t662>His manners, though serious, were gentle, and his reserve seemed more the result of a certain sorrow of spirit than of a naturally gloomy temperament.</t662> <t663>Sir John had dropped hints of past wounds and disappointments, which gave Elinor reason to believe him an unhappy man and to look upon him with respect and compassion.</t663>
<t664>Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him more because of the slights he received from Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for not being either lively or young, seemed determined to undervalue his merits.</t664>
<t665>—Brandon is precisely the type of person —asserted Willoughby one day while they were talking about him— of whom everyone speaks well and who matters to no one; whom everyone is happy to see, and with whom no one remembers to talk.</t665>
<t666>—It's exactly what I think of him —exclaimed Marianne.</t666>
<t667>—But do not boast about it —said Elinor—, because in that both of you are being unfair.</t667> <t668>At Barton Park everyone holds him in high regard, and as for me, I never see him without making every possible effort to converse with him.</t668>
<t669>—That you are on his side —replied Willoughby— certainly speaks in favor of the colonel; but as for the appreciation of others, it constitutes a reproach in itself.</t669> <t670>Who would want to submit to the indignity of being approved by women like Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, something that would leave anyone completely indifferent?</t670>
<t671>—But perhaps the mistreatment from people like you and Marianne is compensated by the appreciation from Lady Middleton and her mother.</t671> <t672>If their praise is criticism, your criticism might be praise; because their lack of discernment is no greater than your prejudice and injustice.</t672>
<t673>—When she comes to the defense of her protégé, she is even caustic.</t673>
<t674>My protégé, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sensibility will always be attractive to me.</t674> <t675>Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty.</t675> <t676>He has seen much of the world, has been abroad, has read, and has a thinking head.</t676> <t677>I have found that he can give me a lot of information on various subjects, and he has always answered my questions with the diligence that good education and good character provide.</t677>
<t678>—What it means —exclaimed Marianne disdainfully— is that he has told you that in the East Indies the climate is warm and that mosquitoes are a nuisance.</t678>
<t679>—He would have told me, I have no doubt about it, if I had asked him; but it happens that these are things I had already been informed about.</t679>
<t680>—Perhaps —said Willoughby— your observations have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohurs, and palanquins.</t680>
<t681>—I would dare to say that your observations have gone far beyond your impartiality, Mr. Willoughby.</t681> <t682>But, why do you dislike him?</t682>
<t683>—I don't dislike him.</t683> <t684>On the contrary, I consider him a very respectable man, whom everyone speaks well of and no one notices; who has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to use, and two new coats every year.</t684>
<t685>—To which one could add —exclaimed Marianne— that he has neither genius, nor taste, nor spirit.</t685> <t686>That his mind is dull, his feelings lack ardor, his voice is expressionless.</t686>
<t687>—You decree what his imperfections are in such a general manner —replied Elinor—, and so much supported by the strength of your imagination, that the praises I can give him seem cold and insipid by comparison.</t687> <t688>The only thing I can say is that he is a man of good judgment, well-educated, cultured, gentle in manner, and, I believe, of an affectionate heart.</t688>
<t689>—Miss Dashwood —protested Willoughby—, now you are treating me with very little kindness.</t689> <t690>You try to disarm me with reasons and convince me against my will.</t690> <t691>But it will not work.</t691> <t692>You will find that my stubbornness is as great as your skill.</t692> <t693>I have three irrefutable reasons to dislike Colonel Brandon: he has threatened that it would rain when I wanted good weather; he has found faults with the suspension of my carriage, and I cannot convince him to buy the chestnut mare from me.</t693> <t694>However, if it compensates you in any way for me to say that, in my opinion, his character is irreproachable in other aspects, I am willing to admit it.</t694> <t695>And in return for a confession that does cause me some pain, you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him just as much as before.</t695>
<t696>CHAPTER XI</t696>
<t697>Little had Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters imagined, when they first arrived in Devonshire, that shortly after being introduced, so many engagements would occupy their time, or that the frequency of invitations and the constancy of visits would leave them so few hours to dedicate to serious pursuits.</t697> <t698>However, that is what happened.</t698> <t699>When Marianne recovered, the plans for entertainments at home and outside, which Sir John had previously been imagining, began to come to fruition.</t699> <t700>Private dances were initiated at Barton Park, and they made as many excursions to the coast as a rainy October permitted.</t700> <t701>Willoughby was included in all these gatherings; and the ease and familiarity that lent such naturalness to these meetings were precisely calculated to increasingly deepen his intimacy with the Dashwoods; to allow him to witness Marianne's excellences, make his lively admiration for her more evident, and receive, through her behavior towards him, the fullest assurance of her affection.</t701>
<t702>Elinor could not feel surprised at the attachment between the young people.</t702> <t703>She only wished they would show it less openly, and once or twice she ventured to suggest to Marianne the advisability of a certain self-control.</t703> <t704>But Marianne abhorred all disguise when frankness would not lead to real harm; and to insist on repressing feelings that were not in themselves censurable seemed to her not only an unnecessary effort, but also a regrettable subjugation of reason to erroneous and commonplace ideas.</t704> <t705>Willoughby thought the same; and at all times, their behavior was a perfect illustration of their opinions.</t705>
<t706>When he was present, she had eyes for no one else.</t706> <t707>Everything he did was right.</t707> <t708>Everything he said was intelligent.</t708> <t709>If their afternoons at the estate ended with card games, he would cheat himself and the other guests to give her a good hand.</t709> <t710>If dancing was the evening's entertainment, they would pair up half the time; and when they were forced to separate for a couple of dances, they made sure to stand next to each other and barely spoke a word to anyone else.</t710> <t711>Of course, such conduct exposed them to the constant laughter of others, but the ridicule did not embarrass them and hardly seemed to bother them.</t711>
<t712>Mrs. Dashwood cherished all her feelings with a tenderness that deprived her of any desire to control their excessive display.</t712> <t713>To her, such abundance was nothing but the natural consequence of intense affection in young and passionate spirits.</t713>
<t714>This was the time of happiness for Marianne.</t714> <t715>Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the charms that his company brought to her current home seemed to weaken more than she had previously thought possible the sentimental attachment to Norland that she had brought with her from Sussex.</t715>
<t716>Elinor's happiness did not reach such heights.</t716> <t717>Her heart was not so much at peace, nor was her satisfaction as complete with the amusements they participated in.</t717> <t718>They had not provided her with any company capable of compensating for what she had left behind, or of making her remember Norland with less longing.</t718> <t719>Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could offer her the type of conversation she needed, although the latter was an indefatigable talker and the cordiality with which she had welcomed her from the beginning ensured that a large part of her comments were directed at her.</t719> <t720>She had already repeated her own story to Elinor three or four times; and if Elinor's memory had been up to the means Mrs. Jennings employed to enhance it, she could have known from the very first moments of their acquaintance all the details of Mr. Jennings' last illness and what he said to his wife minutes before he died.</t720> <t721>Lady Middleton was more pleasant than her mother only in that she was quieter.</t721> <t722>Elinor needed very little observation to realize that her reserve was merely a placidity in all her manners that had nothing to do with good judgment.</t722> <t723>With her husband and her mother, she was the same as with her and her sister; consequently, intimacy was neither desired nor sought.</t723> <t724>She never had anything to say that she hadn't already said the day before.</t724> <t725>Her insipidity was unalterable, for even her mood always remained the same; and although she did not oppose the gatherings her husband organized, provided that everything was conducted with distinction and her two eldest children accompanied her, those occasions did not seem to offer her more pleasure than she would experience staying at home; and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of others through any participation in the conversations, that sometimes the only thing that reminded them she was among them were the efforts she made around her bothersome children.</t725>
<t726>Only in Colonel Brandon, among all her new acquaintances, did Elinor find a person deserving of some degree of respect for his abilities, whose friendship was worth cultivating or who could constitute a pleasant company.</t726> <t727>Willoughby could not be counted on.</t727> <t728>He had all her admiration and affection, even as a sister; but he was a lover: his attentions belonged entirely to Marianne, and even a man much less entertaining than he could have been generally more agreeable.</t728> <t729>Colonel Brandon, unfortunately, had not been encouraged in the same way to think only of Marianne, and in his conversations with Elinor, he found the greatest consolation for her sister's total indifference.</t729>
<t730>Elinor's compassion for him grew greater every day, for she had reasons to suspect that he had already known the miseries of a disappointed love.</t730> <t731>This suspicion arose from some words that accidentally came out of his mouth one afternoon at Barton Park, when by his own choice they were sitting together while the others danced.</t731> <t732>He was staring fixedly at Marianne and, after a silence of a few minutes, said with an almost imperceptible smile:</t732>
<t733>—Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second marriages.</t733>
<t734>—No —replied Elinor—; his opinions are completely romantic.</t734>
<t735>—Or rather, I believe, he considers its existence impossible.</t735>
<t736>—I believe so.</t736> <t737>But how she manages to do so without thinking about the character of her own father, who had two wives, is something I do not know.</t737> <t738>A few more years, however, and she will base her opinions on the reasonable foundation of common sense and observation; and then she may be able to define and defend them better than today, when only she does so.</t738>
<t739>—Probably that is what will happen —he replied—; but there is something so sweet in the prejudices of a young mind, that one comes to feel sorry to see how they give way and make room for more common opinions.</t739>
<t740>—I cannot agree with you on that —said Elinor—.</t740> <t741>Feelings like Marianne's present inconveniences that not all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance, past and future, can redeem.</t741> <t742>All her standards have the unfortunate tendency to completely ignore social conventions; and I hope that a better knowledge of the world will be of great benefit to her.</t742>
<t743>After a short pause, he resumed the conversation by saying:</t743>
<t744>—Does your sister make no distinction in her objections to a second union?</t744> <t745>Does she find it equally objectionable in anyone?</t745> <t746>For the rest of their lives, should those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether due to the inconstancy of their object or the perversity of circumstances, remain equally undifferentiated?</t746>
<t747>—I assure you that I do not know her principles in detail.</t747> <t748>I only know that I have never heard her admit any case in which a second union is forgivable.</t748>
<t749>—That —he said— cannot last; but a change, a total change in feelings...</t749> <t750>No, no, I must not wish for it... because when the romantic refinements of a young spirit are forced to yield, how often they are succeeded by opinions that are too common and too dangerous!</t750> <t751>I speak from experience.</t751> <t752>I once knew a lady who in temperament and spirit was very much like your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who, due to an imposed change, because of a series of unfortunate circumstances...</t752>
<t753>Here he abruptly interrupted himself; he seemed to think he had said too much, and the expression on his face generated conjectures that otherwise would not have entered Elinor's mind.</t753> <t754>The mentioned lady would have passed by without arousing any suspicion, if he had not convinced Miss Dashwood that nothing concerning her should come from his lips.</t754> <t755>As it happened, it required only the slightest effort of imagination to connect his emotion with the tender memory of a past love.</t755> <t756>Elinor went no further.</t756> <t757>But Marianne, in her place, would not have been content with so little.</t757> <t758>Her active imagination would have quickly elaborated the entire story, arranging everything in the most melancholic order, that of an unfortunate love.</t758>
<t759>CHAPTER XII</t759>
<t760>The next morning, while Elinor and Marianne were walking, the latter told her sister something that, despite everything she knew about Marianne's imprudence and thoughtlessness, surprised her by the extravagant way it testified to both characteristics.</t760> <t761>Marianne told her, with the greatest of pleasures, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he himself had raised on his properties in Somersetshire, specifically intended to be ridden by a woman.</t761> <t762>Disregarding the fact that her mother's plans did not include maintaining a horse —that, if she were to change them, she would have to buy another mount for the servant, keep a groom to ride it, and also build a stable to house them— she had not hesitated to accept the gift and had told her sister in a state of total ecstasy.</t762>
<t763>—He plans to send his servant immediately to Somersetshire to bring it —he added— and when it arrives, we will ride every day.</t763> <t764>You will share it with me.</t764> <t765>Imagine, my dear Elinor, the pleasure of galloping on one of these hills.</t765>
<t766>She was not at all eager to wake up from such a dream of happiness to admit all the sad truths that surrounded her, and for some time she refused to submit to them.</t766> <t767>As for an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle; she was sure that mother would never object, and any horse would do for him; in any case, he could always get one from the estate; and as for the stable, any shed would suffice.</t767> <t768>Elinor then dared to doubt the appropriateness of receiving such a gift from a man they knew so little, or at least for such a short time.</t768> <t769>This was too much.</t769>
<t770>—You are mistaken, Elinor —she said heatedly— in assuming that I know little about Willoughby.</t770> <t771>It is true that I have not known him for a long time, but he is closer to me than any other creature in the world, except you and mother.</t771> <t772>It is not time or occasion that determines intimacy: it is only the character, the disposition of the people.</t772> <t773>Seven years might not be enough for two people to know each other well, and seven days are more than sufficient for others.</t773> <t774>I would feel more guilty of a greater breach of conventions if I accepted a horse from my brother than receiving it from Willoughby.</t774> <t775>I know very little about John, even though we have lived together for years; but regarding Willoughby, I have long since formed an opinion.</t775>
<t776>Elinor thought it was wiser not to continue touching on the subject.</t776> <t777>She knew her sister's temperament.</t777> <t778>Opposing her on such a sensitive topic would only serve to make her cling more to her own opinion.</t778> <t779>But an appeal to her affection for their mother, making her see the inconveniences that such an indulgent mother would have to endure if (as would probably happen) she consented to this increase in their expenses, overcame Marianne without much delay.</t779> <t780>She promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby the next time she saw him that he should decline it.</t780>
<t781>She was true to her word; and when Willoughby visited her that same day, Elinor heard her quietly express her disappointment at being obliged to refuse his present.</t781> <t782>At the same time, she explained the reasons for this change, which were of such a nature as to make any insistence on the young man's part impossible.</t782> <t783>Nevertheless, his concern was very evident, and after expressing it with great intensity, he also added in a low voice:</t783>
<t784>—But, Marianne, the horse is still yours, even though you can't use it now.</t784> <t785>I will keep it under my care only until you claim it.</t785> <t786>When you leave Barton to settle in a more permanent home, Reina Mab 2 will be waiting for you.</t786>
<t787>All this reached Miss Dashwood's ears, and in every word of Willoughby, in his manner of pronouncing them and in addressing her sister only by her first name, using the informal "tú," she immediately saw such a definitive intimacy, such a transparent sense, that they could only constitute a clear sign of a perfect understanding between them.</t787> <t788>From that moment on, she no longer doubted that they were engaged; and such a belief caused her no other surprise than noticing how such frank characters had let her, or any of their friends, discover that engagement only by accident.</t788>
<t789>The next day, Margaret told her something that shed even more light on this matter.</t789> <t790>Willoughby had spent the previous afternoon with them, and Margaret, having stayed for a while in the sitting room with him and Marianne, had the opportunity to make some observations which, with a look of great importance, she communicated to her older sister when they were alone.</t790>
<t791>—Oh, Elinor! —she exclaimed—.</t791> <t792>I have a huge secret to tell you about Marianne.</t792> <t793>I'm sure she will marry Mr. Willoughby very soon.</t793>
<t794>—You have said the same thing —replied Elinor— almost every day since the first time they met on the church hill; and I think it wasn't even a week after they met that you were sure Marianne was wearing his portrait around her neck; but it turned out it was just the miniature of our great-uncle.</t794>
<t795>—But this is something truly different.</t795> <t796>I'm sure they will get married very soon, because he has a lock of her hair.</t796>
<t797>—Be careful, Margaret.</t797> <t798>It might just be the hair of one of his great-uncles.</t798>
<t799>—But, Elinor, it really is Marianne's.</t799> <t800>I'm almost sure it is, because I saw when she cut it.</t800> <t801>Last night after tea, when you and mom left the room, they were whispering and talking very quickly, and it seemed like he was begging her for something, and then he took her scissors and cut a long lock of her hair, because she had all her hair loose down her back; and he kissed it, wrapped it in a piece of white paper, and put it in his wallet.</t801>
<t802>Elinor could not help but give credence to all these details, spoken with such authority; nor did she feel inclined not to, because the related circumstance perfectly matched what she herself had heard and seen.</t802>
<t803>Margaret did not always display her sagacity in a manner so satisfactory to her sister.</t803> <t804>One afternoon at Barton Park, when Mrs. Jennings began to pester her for the name of the young man for whom Elinor had a special preference, a matter that had long gnawed at her curiosity, Margaret responded by looking at her sister and saying:</t804>
<t805>—I shouldn't say it, should I, Elinor?</t805>
<t806>This, of course, made everyone laugh, and Elinor tried to laugh as well.</t806> <t807>But the effort was painful for her.</t807> <t808>She was convinced that Margaret was thinking of a person whose name she would not be able to endure becoming the usual joke of Mrs. Jennings.</t808>
<t809>Marianne sincerely sympathized with her sister, but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying to Margaret in a very angry tone:</t809>
<t810>—Remember that no matter what your assumptions are, you do not have the right to repeat them.</t810>
<t811>—I have never assumed anything about it —replied Margaret—, it was you yourself who told me.</t811>
<t812>This further increased the joy of the audience, who began to press Margaret insistently to say something more.</t812>
<t813>—Ah! I beg you, Miss Margaret, tell us everything —said Mrs. Jennings—.</t813> <t814>What is the gentleman's name?</t814>
<t815>—I mustn't say, ma'am.</t815> <t816>But I know very well; and I know where he is too.</t816>
<t817>—Yes, yes, we can guess where he is: in his own house in Norland, for sure.</t817> <t818>I bet he is a clergyman, there in the parish.</t818>
<t819>—No, that's not it.</t819> <t820>He doesn't have any profession.</t820>
<t821>—Margaret —said Marianne, energetically—, you know well that all this is your invention, and that there is no such person.</t821>
<t822>—Well, then, he has died recently, Marianne, because I am sure that this man existed, and his name begins with F.</t822>
<t823>Elinor felt enormous gratitude towards Lady Middleton at that moment upon hearing her comment that "it had rained a lot," although she thought the interruption was less out of consideration for her and more due to her ladyship's deep displeasure with the lack of elegance in the jokes that delighted her husband and mother.</t823> <t824>However, the idea initiated by her was immediately picked up by Colonel Brandon, always attentive to the feelings of others; and thus, they both talked a lot about the matter of the rain.</t824> <t825>Willoughby opened the piano and asked Marianne to play it; in this way, among the various initiatives of different people to end the topic, it was forgotten.</t825> <t826>But it was not equally easy for Elinor to recover from the state of unease that had overtaken her.</t826>
<t827>That afternoon, an outing was organized to visit a very pleasant place the next day, about twelve miles from Barton and owned by a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose presence it could not be visited since the owner, who was abroad, had left strict orders to that effect.</t827> <t828>They said the site was of great beauty, and Sir John, whose praises were particularly enthusiastic, could be considered a suitable judge because at least twice every summer for the last ten years he had organized excursions to visit it.</t828> <t829>There was a noble amount of water there; a boat ride was to constitute a large part of the morning's fun; cold provisions would be brought, only open carriages would be used, and everything would be carried out in the usual manner of a genuine pleasure excursion.</t829>
<t830>For a few among the crowd, it seemed like a somewhat daring venture, considering the time of year and that it had rained during the last fortnight.</t830> <t831>Elinor persuaded Mrs. Dashwood, who was already suffering from a cold, to stay at home.</t831>
<t832>CHAPTER XIII</t832>
<t833>The planned excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected.</t833> <t834>She had prepared to be completely soaked, tired, and scared; but the occasion turned out even more unfortunate, because they didn't even go.</t834>
<t835>Around ten in the morning, everyone was gathered at Barton Park, where they were going to have breakfast.</t835> <t836>Although it had rained all night, the weather was quite good, as the clouds were dispersing across the sky and the sun appeared with some frequency.</t836> <t837>Everyone was in excellent spirits and good humor, eager for the opportunity to feel happy, and determined to endure the greatest inconveniences and hardships to achieve it.</t837>
<t838>While they were having breakfast, the mail arrived.</t838> <t839>Among the letters, there was one for Colonel Brandon.</t839> <t840>He took it, looked at the address, his face changed color, and he immediately left the room.</t840>
<t841>—What is wrong with Brandon? —asked Sir John.</t841> <t842>No one could say.</t842>
<t843>—I hope it is not bad news —said Lady Middleton—.</t843> <t844>It must be something extraordinary to make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly.</t844>
<t845>Five minutes later, he was back.</t845>
<t846>—I hope it's not bad news, Colonel?</t846> <t847>—asked Mrs. Jennings as soon as she saw him enter the room.</t847>
<t848>—Not at all, ma'am, thank you.</t848>
<t849>Was it from Avignon?</t849> <t850>I hope it wasn't to inform you that your sister has gotten worse?</t850>
<t851>—No, ma'am.</t851> <t852>I was coming from the city, and it is simply a business letter.</t852>
<t853>—But, how could he become so upset upon seeing the handwriting, if it was just a business letter?</t853> <t854>Come on, come on, Colonel; that explanation doesn't work; tell us the truth.</t854>
<t855>—My dear lady —said Lady Middleton—, pay close attention to what you are saying.</t855>
<t856>Is it perhaps to tell her that her cousin Fanny has gotten married? —continued Mrs. Jennings, ignoring her daughter's reproach.</t856>
<t857>—No, certainly not.</t857>
<t858>—Well, then I know whose it is, Colonel.</t858> <t859>And I hope she is well.</t859>
<t860>—Who are you referring to, ma'am? —he asked, blushing slightly.</t860>
<t861>—Ah! You know who.</t861>
<t862>—I especially regret, madam —declared the colonel addressing Lady Middleton— having received this letter today, because it concerns business that demands my immediate presence in the city.</t862>
<t863>In the city! —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings—.</t863> <t864>What could you possibly have to do in the city at this time of year?</t864>
<t865>—Being forced to abandon such a pleasant excursion —he continued— means a great loss for me; but my greatest concern is that I fear my presence is necessary for you to have access to Whitwell.</t865>
<t866>What a great blow this was for everyone!</t866>
<t867>—But wouldn't it be enough, Mr. Brandon —inquired Marianne with a certain unease—, if you wrote a note to the caretaker of the house?</t867>
<t868>The colonel shook his head.</t868>
<t869>—We must go —said Sir John—.</t869> <t870>We are not going to postpone it when we are about to leave.</t870> <t871>You, Brandon, will have to go to the city tomorrow, and there's nothing more to say.</t871>
<t872>—I wish the solution were that easy.</t872> <t873>But it is not within my power to delay my trip even a single day.</t873>
<t874>—If you would allow us to know what business is calling you —said Mrs. Jennings—, we could see if it can be postponed or not.</t874>
<t875>—He wouldn't be delayed more than six hours —added Willoughby— if he agreed to postpone his trip until we return.</t875>
<t876>—I can't afford to lose even an hour.</t876>
<t877>Elinor then heard Willoughby say to Marianne in a low voice:</t877>
<t878>—Some people can't stand a pleasure trip.</t878> <t879>Brandon is one of them.</t879> <t880>He was afraid of catching a cold, I would say, and invented this trick to get away.</t880> <t881>I would bet fifty guineas that he wrote the letter himself.</t881>
<t882>—I have no doubt at all —replied Marianne.</t882>
<t883>—When you make a decision, Brandon —said Sir John—, there is no way to persuade you to change your mind, I have always known that.</t883> <t884>However, I hope you reconsider.</t884> <t885>Remember that there are the two Miss Careys, who have come from Newton; the three Miss Dashwoods walked from their house, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours earlier than usual, all with the purpose of going to Whitwell.</t885>
<t886>Colonel Brandon again repeated how much he regretted that the excursion was thwarted because of him, but at the same time he declared that it was inevitable.</t886>
<t887>—And then, when will he be back?</t887>
<t888>—I hope we see him in Barton —added his lordship— as soon as he can leave the city; and we must postpone the excursion to Whitwell until his return.</t888>
<t889>—You are very kind.</t889> <t890>But I have so little certainty about when I will be able to return that I do not dare to commit to it.</t890>
<t891>—Oh!</t891> <t892>He has to come back, and he will —exclaimed Sir John—.</t892> <t893>If he is not here by the weekend, I will go look for him.</t893>
<t894>—Yes, do it, Sir John —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings—, and that way you might be able to find out what his business is about.</t894>
<t895>—I don't want to meddle in another man's affairs; I imagine it's something that embarrasses him...</t895>
<t896>At that moment, Colonel Brandon's horses were ready.</t896>
<t897>—You don't intend to go to the city on horseback, do you? —added Sir John.</t897>
<t898>—No, only up to Honiton.</t898> <t899>There I will take the post chaise.</t899>
<t900>—Well, since you are determined to leave, I wish you a good trip.</t900> <t901>But it would have been better if you had changed your mind.</t901>
<t902>—I assure you that it is not within my power to do so.</t902>
<t903>He then said goodbye to the whole group.</t903>
<t904>Is there any chance of seeing you and your sisters in the city this winter, Miss</t904> <t905>Dashwood?</t905>
<t906>I am afraid not in any way.</t906>
<t907>—Then I must say goodbye for longer than I would like.</t907>
<t908>In front of Marianne, he only bowed his head without saying anything.</t908>
<t909>—Let's go, Colonel —Mrs. Jennings insisted—, before you leave, tell us where you are going.</t909>
<t910>The colonel wished him good morning and, accompanied by Sir John, left the room.</t910>
<t911>The complaints and lamentations that good manners had so far repressed now erupted in a widespread manner; and everyone repeatedly agreed on how annoying it was to feel so frustrated.</t911>
<t912>—I can guess, however, what business that is —said Mrs. Jennings with great delight.</t912>
<t913>—Really, ma'am? —almost everyone said.</t913>
<t914>—Yes, I am sure it is Miss Williams.</t914>
<t915>—And who is Miss Williams? —asked Marianne.</t915>
<t916>—What! Don't you know who Miss Williams is?</t916> <t917>I'm sure you must have heard her name before.</t917> <t918>She is a relative of the colonel, dear; a very close relative.</t918> <t919>We won't say how close, for fear of scandalizing the young ladies.</t919> <t920>—Then, lowering her voice somewhat, she said to Elinor—: She is his natural daughter.</t920>
<t921>—Incredible!</t921>
<t922>—Oh, yes!</t922> <t923>And he looks just like him, like one drop of water to another.</t923> <t924>I would dare to say that the colonel will leave him his fortune.</t924>
<t925>Upon returning, Sir John joined with great enthusiasm in the general lamentation over such an unfortunate incident; however, he concluded by observing that since they were all together, they should do something to cheer themselves up; and after some consultations, they agreed that although they could only find happiness in Whitwell, they could procure an acceptable peace of mind by taking a walk in the countryside.</t925> <t926>Then they brought the carriages; Willoughby's was the first, and Marianne had never seemed happier than when she got into it.</t926> <t927>Willoughby drove at great speed through the estate, and very soon they were out of sight; and nothing more was seen of them until their return, which did not occur until after everyone else had arrived.</t927> <t928>Both seemed delighted with their ride, but said only in general terms that they had not left the paths, while the others had gone towards the hills.</t928>
<t929>It was agreed that there would be a dance at dusk and that everyone should be extremely cheerful throughout the day.</t929> <t930>Other members of the Carey family arrived for dinner, and they had the pleasure of gathering almost twenty at the table, which Sir John observed very happily.</t930> <t931>Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.</t931> <t932>Mrs. Jennings sat to Elinor's right; and they had not been there long when she passed behind the young woman and Willoughby and said to Marianne, in a voice loud enough for both to hear:</t932>
<t933>—I have discovered them, despite all their tricks.</t933> <t934>I know where they spent the morning.</t934>
<t935>Marianne blushed and replied with a nervous voice:</t935>
<t936>Where, if you please?</t936>
<t937>Didn't you know —said Willoughby— that we had gone out in my carriage?</t937>
<t938>—Yes, yes, Mr. Descaro, I know that well, and I was determined to find out where they had been.</t938> <t939>I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne.</t939> <t940>It is very large, I know, and when you come to visit it, I hope you have furnished it again, because it was in great need the last time I was there six years ago.</t940>
<t941>Marianne turned around in a state of great agitation.</t941> <t942>Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor discovered that in her insistence on knowing where they had been, she even had her own maid question Mr. Willoughby's groom, and by that means learned that they had gone to Allenham and spent a good time strolling through the garden and touring the house.</t942>
<t943>It was difficult for Elinor to believe that it was true, as it seemed so unlikely that Willoughby would propose, or Marianne would accept, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith, to whom Marianne had never been introduced, was there.</t943>
<t944>As soon as they left the dining room, Elinor asked her about what had happened; and great was her surprise to discover that every one of the circumstances that Mrs. Jennings had recounted was completely true.</t944> <t945>Marianne was quite angry with her sister for having doubted it.</t945>
<t946>—Why would you think, Elinor, that we didn't go there or that we didn't see the house?</t946> <t947>Isn't that something you have often wanted to do yourself?</t947>
<t948>—Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with no other company than Mr. Willoughby.</t948>
<t949>—Mr. Willoughby, however, is the only person who can have the right to show that house; and since it was in an open carriage, it was impossible to have another companion.</t949> <t950>I have never spent such a pleasant morning in my entire life.</t950>
<t951>"I fear," replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness of an occupation is not always proof of its correctness."</t951>
<t952>—On the contrary, nothing could be more —compelling proof of it, Elinor; for if what I did had been in any way wrong, I would have been feeling it all the time, because we always know when we act wrongly, and with such conviction, I could not have enjoyed it.</t952> <t953>— —But, my dear Marianne, as this has already exposed you to some rather impertinent remarks, don't you begin to doubt now the discretion of your conduct?</t953>
<t954>—If Mrs. Jennings' impertinent remarks are going to be proof of the incorrectness of conduct, we are all at fault at every moment of our lives.</t954> <t955>I value her censures no more than I would value her praises.</t955> <t956>I am not aware of having done anything wrong by walking through Mrs. Smith's gardens or visiting her house.</t956> <t957>Someday they will belong to Mr. Willoughby, and...</t957>
<t958>—If one day they were to be yours, Marianne, that would not justify what you have done.</t958>
<t959>Marianne blushed at this insinuation, but it was even apparent that it was gratifying for her; and after a lapse of ten minutes of intense meditation, she approached her sister again and said with quite good humor:</t959>
<t960>—Perhaps, Elinor, it was imprudent of me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby was very keen on showing me the place; and it is a lovely house, I assure you.</t960> <t961>There is an extremely pretty little room upstairs, of a very pleasant and comfortable size, which can be used throughout the year, and with modern furniture it would be exquisite.</t961> <t962>It is situated in a corner, with windows on both sides.</t962> <t963>On one side, through a field planted with grass where bowling is played, behind the house, you see a beautiful sloping wood; on the other, you have a view of the church and the village and, beyond, those beautiful steep hills that we have so often admired.</t963> <t964>I did not see this little room in the best of circumstances, because nothing could be more neglected than that furniture... but if it were fixed up with new things... a couple of hundred pounds, says Willoughby, would transform it into one of the most pleasant summer rooms in all of England.</t964>
<t965>If Elinor had been able to listen to her without interruptions from others, she would have described every room in the house with the same enthusiasm.</t965>
<t966>CHAPTER XIV</t966>
<t967>The sudden end of Colonel Brandon's visit to Barton Park, along with his determination to conceal the reasons for such a decision, occupied all of Mrs. Jennings' thoughts for two or three days, leading her to imagine the most diverse explanations.</t967> <t968>She had an enormous capacity for making conjectures, as anyone must have who takes such a keen interest in the comings and goings of each of their acquaintances.</t968> <t969>She wondered almost incessantly what the reason could be; she was sure it must be bad news, and she went through all the misfortunes that could have befallen him, firmly resolved that he would not escape them.</t969>
<t970>—I am sure it must be something very sad —she stated—.</t970> <t971>I could see it in his face.</t971> <t972>Poor man!</t972> <t973>I fear he is in a bad situation.</t973> <t974>It has never been known that his lands in Delaford produce more than two thousand pounds a year, and his brother left everything unfortunately compromised.</t974> <t975>I truly believe he has been called for money matters, because, what else could it be?</t975> <t976>I wonder if that is the case.</t976> <t977>I would give anything to know.</t977> <t978>Perhaps it is about Miss Williams... and, by the way, I dare say it is, because he seemed so affected when I mentioned her.</t978> <t979>Maybe she is sick in town; it is quite possible, because I have the idea that she is rather sickly.</t979> <t980>I would bet anything that it is about Miss Williams.</t980> <t981>It is not very likely that he is in financial trouble now, because he is a very prudent man and surely by now he must have cleared up the situation of his properties.</t981> <t982>I wonder what it could be!</t982> <t983>Perhaps his sister has worsened in Avignon, and has sent for him.</t983> <t984>His haste in leaving seems to align with that.</t984> <t985>Well, I wholeheartedly wish that he gets out of all his troubles, and with a good wife to boot.</t985>
<t986>Thus Mrs. Jennings rambled, thus she spoke; her opinions changed with each new conjecture, and all seemed equally probable to her at the moment they were born.</t986> <t987>Elinor, although she felt genuine concern for Colonel Brandon's well-being, could not devote to his sudden departure all the anxieties that Mrs. Jennings demanded she feel; because besides the fact that, in her opinion, the circumstances did not warrant such persistent disquisitions or variety of speculations, her perplexity was directed to another matter.</t987> <t988>She was completely occupied in elucidating the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby regarding what they must have known was of special interest to everyone.</t988> <t989>As this silence persisted, each passing day made it seem stranger and more incompatible with the character of both.</t989> <t990>Why they did not openly acknowledge to their mother and herself what, minute by minute, their mutual behavior declared to have taken place, was something Elinor could not imagine.</t990>
<t991>It was easy to understand that marriage was not something Willoughby could undertake immediately; for although he was independent, there was no reason to believe him wealthy.</t991> <t992>Sir John had estimated his assets at around six or seven hundred pounds a year, but this income could hardly be in line with the rank at which he lived, and he himself often complained of poverty.</t992> <t993>Even so, Elinor could not explain this strange kind of secrecy they maintained regarding their engagement, secrecy that in practice concealed nothing; and it was so completely contradictory to all their opinions and behaviors, that sometimes she doubted whether they were truly engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her from asking Marianne any questions.</t993>
<t994>In the eyes of the whole family, there was no clearer sign of the affection they had for each other than Willoughby's behavior.</t994> <t995>He distinguished Marianne with all the displays of tenderness that a loving heart can offer, and with the others, he had the affectionate attentions of a son and a brother.</t995> <t996>He seemed to consider their house as his home, and to love it accordingly; many more hours of his life were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement brought them together at Barton Park, the exercise that occupied his mornings almost certainly ended there, where he spent the rest of the day with Marianne, and with his favorite pointer at her feet.</t996>
<t997>One particular afternoon, about a week after Colonel Brandon had left the region, Willoughby seemed to open his heart more than usual to feelings of attachment for all the objects around him; and when Mrs. Dashwood mentioned her intentions to improve the cottage that spring, he vehemently opposed any alteration to a place that, through the affection he felt for it, he had come to consider perfect.</t997>
<t998>What! —he exclaimed—.</t998> <t999>Improve this dear little house.</t999> <t1000>No... I will never accept that.</t1000> <t1001>You must not add a single stone to its walls, nor an inch to its size, if you have any consideration for my feelings.</t1001>
<t1002>—Don't be alarmed —said Miss Dashwood—, nothing of that sort will be done, for my mother will never have enough money to attempt it.</t1002>
<t1003>I'm glad with all my heart —exclaimed the young man—.</t1003> <t1004>I hope he always remains poor if he cannot use his wealth for anything better.</t1004>
<t1005>—Thank you, Willoughby.</t1005> <t1006>But you can be sure that not all the improvements in the world would lead me to sacrifice the feelings of affection towards the house that you, or anyone I care about, might have.</t1006> <t1007>Trust that any amount of unused money that might remain when I do my accounts in the spring, I would prefer to leave it without a purpose than to use it in a way that causes you so much pain.</t1007> <t1008>But, do you really feel so attached to this place that you don't see any flaws in it?</t1008>
<t1009>—Yes —he said—.</t1009> <t1010>For me, it is impeccable.</t1010> <t1011>No, I consider it even more to be the only type of construction in which happiness can be achieved; and if I were rich enough, I would immediately demolish Combe and rebuild it according to the exact plan of this little house.</t1011>
<t1012>—With dark and narrow stairs and a kitchen full of smoke, I suppose —commented Elinor.</t1012>
<t1013>—Yes —he exclaimed with the same vehement tone—, with each and every one of the things it has; not the slightest change should be noticed in any of its comforts or discomforts.</t1013> <t1014>Then, and only then, under such a roof, might I perhaps be as happy in Combe as I have been in Barton.</t1014>
<t1015>—I believe I know —replied Elinor— that even with the disadvantage of better rooms and a wider staircase, henceforth you will find your own house as impeccable as this one.</t1015>
<t1016>—Certainly there are circumstances —said Willoughby— that could make it much dearer to me; but this place will always have a spot in my heart that no other can share.</t1016>
<t1017>Mrs. Dashwood looked on with pleasure at Marianne, whose beautiful eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby that they clearly indicated how well she understood him.</t1017>
<t1018>—How often I wished —added the young man—, when I was in Allenham a year ago, that the cottage at Barton was inhabited!</t1018> <t1019>I never passed by its surroundings without admiring its location and regretting that no one lived in it.</t1019> <t1020>How little did I imagine then that the first news I would hear from Mrs. Smith, when I just arrived in the region, would be that the cottage at Barton was occupied!</t1020> <t1021>And I felt an instant satisfaction and interest in that fact, which nothing could explain but a kind of premonition of the happiness I would find here.</t1021> <t1022>Isn't that how it must have happened, Marianne? —he said in a quieter voice.</t1022> <t1023>And then, resuming his previous tone, he continued—: And yet, Mrs. Dashwood, you would want to ruin this house!</t1023> <t1024>You would strip it of its simplicity with imaginary improvements!</t1024> <t1025>And this dear little room, where our meeting began and where we have since shared so many happy hours, would be degraded to the condition of a vulgar reception room, and everyone would then hurry to simply pass through it, through this room that until that moment would have contained within it more facilities and comforts than any other room of the largest dimensions that the world could afford.</t1025>
<t1026>Mrs. Dashwood assured him once again that no transformation like the ones he mentioned would take place.</t1026>
<t1027>—You are a good woman —he replied with an expression of great warmth—, Your promise reassures me.</t1027> <t1028>Extend it a bit more, and you will make me happy.</t1028> <t1029>Tell me that not only will your house remain the same, but that I will always find you, and yours, as unchanged as your home; and that I will always find in you that kind treatment that has made everything that belongs to you so dear to me.</t1029>
<t1030>The promise was promptly given, and throughout the entire afternoon, Willoughby's behavior continued to display both his affection and his happiness.</t1030>
<t1031>—Will we see you tomorrow for dinner? —Mrs. Dashwood asked him as he was leaving—.</t1031> <t1032>I don't ask you to come in the morning, because we must go to Barton Park to visit Lady Middleton.</t1032>
<t1033>The young man promised to be there at four in the afternoon.</t1033>
<t1034>CHAPTER XV</t1034>
<t1035>The visit of Mrs. Dashwood to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and two of her daughters went with her; Marianne, for her part, excused herself with the trivial pretext of having some pending occupation; and her mother, who concluded that the previous night Willoughby had made some promise to visit her while they were away, was completely in agreement with her staying at home.</t1035>
<t1036>Upon returning from the estate, they found Willoughby's carriage and his servant waiting at the door, and Mrs. Dashwood was certain that her conjecture had been correct.</t1036> <t1037>Up to that moment, everything had been just as she had predicted; but upon entering the house, she beheld what no foresight had allowed her to expect.</t1037> <t1038>They had scarcely entered the hallway when Marianne came rushing out of the sitting room, seemingly violently distressed, covering her eyes with a handkerchief, and without noticing their presence, she ran upstairs.</t1038> <t1039>Surprised and alarmed, they went directly into the room she had just left, where they found Willoughby leaning against the mantelpiece with his back turned towards them.</t1039> <t1040>He turned upon sensing their entrance, and his countenance showed that he intensely shared the emotion to which Marianne had succumbed.</t1040>
<t1041>—Is something wrong with her?</t1041> <t1042>—exclaimed Mrs. Dashwood upon entering—.</t1042> <t1043>Is she ill?</t1043>
<t1044>—I hope not —replied the young man, trying to appear cheerful; and with a forced smile, he added—:</t1044> <t1045>Actually, I might be the one who is sick... at this very moment, I am suffering a terrible disappointment!</t1045>
<t1046>—Disillusionment!</t1046>
<t1047>—Yes, because I find myself unable to fulfill my commitment to you.</t1047> <t1048>This morning Mrs. Smith has exercised the privilege of the rich over a poor cousin who depends on her, and has sent me to London on business.</t1048> <t1049>I have just received the credential letters from her and have taken my leave of Allenham; and to top off these so jocular events, I have come to bid you farewell.</t1049>
<t1050>—To London... and are you leaving this morning?</t1050>
<t1051>—Almost immediately.</t1051>
<t1052>—What misfortune!</t1052> <t1053>But we must bow to Mrs. Smith's wishes... and her business will not keep her away from us for long, I hope.</t1053>
<t1054>The young man blushed as he answered:</t1054>
<t1055>—You are very kind, but I have no plans to return to Devonshire immediately.</t1055> <t1056>My visits to Mrs. Smith never repeat within the year.</t1056>
<t1057>—Is Mrs. Smith your only friend?</t1057> <t1058>And is Allenham the only house in the area where you are welcome?</t1058> <t1059>Shame on you, Willoughby!</t1059> <t1060>Can't you wait for an invitation here?</t1060>
<t1061>Her embarrassment grew more intense, and with her eyes fixed on the floor, she simply replied:</t1061>
<t1062>—You are too kind.</t1062>
<t1063>Surprised, Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor.</t1063> <t1064>Elinor felt the same astonishment.</t1064> <t1065>For a few moments, everyone remained silent.</t1065> <t1066>Mrs. Dashwood was the first to speak.</t1066>
<t1067>—I only have to add, my dear Willoughby, that you will always be welcome in this house; I will not press you to return immediately, because you are the only one who can judge to what extent that will please Mrs. Smith; and in this I will be no more willing to discuss your decision than to doubt your wishes.</t1067>
<t1068>—My current commitments —replied Willoughby in a state of great confusion— are of such a nature... that... I do not dare to consider myself deserving...</t1068>
<t1069>He stopped.</t1069> <t1070>Mrs. Dashwood's astonishment rendered her speechless, and a new pause ensued.</t1070> <t1071>This was interrupted by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile:</t1071>
<t1072>—It is madness to delay my departure in this manner.</t1072> <t1073>I will no longer torment myself by staying among friends whose company I can no longer enjoy.</t1073>
<t1074>He quickly said goodbye to them and left the room.</t1074> <t1075>They saw him climb into his carriage, and in a minute he was out of sight.</t1075>
<t1076>Mrs. Dashwood was too shocked to speak, and at the same moment she left the room to give herself up in solitude to the worry and alarm that such a sudden departure had aroused in her.</t1076>
<t1077>Elinor's unease was at least equal to her mother's.</t1077> <t1078>She pondered what had happened with anxiety and distrust.</t1078> <t1079>Willoughby's behavior when saying goodbye to them, his agitation and feigned cheerfulness, and above all, his reluctance to accept her mother's invitation, a shyness so uncharacteristic of a lover, so uncharacteristic of what he himself was, deeply worried her.</t1079> <t1080>At times she feared that there had never been any serious intention on Willoughby's part; then, that some unfortunate dispute had occurred between him and his sister; the anguish that overwhelmed Marianne at the moment she left the room was so great that a serious quarrel could well explain it; although when she thought about how much Marianne loved him, a fight seemed almost impossible.</t1080>
<t1081>But, whatever the circumstances of their separation, her sister's grief was undeniable, and Elinor thought with the tenderest compassion of that heartbreaking sorrow which Marianne was not only expressing as a way to alleviate it, but also nurturing and encouraging as if it were a duty.</t1081>
<t1082>About half an hour later, his mother returned, and although her eyes were red, her expression was not unhappy.</t1082>
<t1083>—Our dear Willoughby is already a few miles from Barton, Elinor —she said, as she sat down to work—, and with how much sorrow in his heart he must be traveling!</t1083>
<t1084>—Everything is very strange.</t1084> <t1085>Leaving so quickly!</t1085> <t1086>It seems like such a sudden decision.</t1086> <t1087>And last night he was so happy here, so cheerful, so affectionate!</t1087> <t1088>And now, with only ten minutes' notice... has he left with no intention of returning?</t1088> <t1089>Something more must have happened that he felt was his duty not to tell us.</t1089> <t1090>He neither spoke nor behaved like the person we know.</t1090> <t1091>You must have noticed the difference just as I did.</t1091> <t1092>What could it be? Could they have quarreled?</t1092> <t1093>What other reason could he have had for showing so little desire to accept your invitation to this house?</t1093>
<t1094>—It wasn't desire that he lacked, Elinor!</t1094> <t1095>I saw it quite clearly.</t1095> <t1096>It wasn't in his power to accept it.</t1096> <t1097>I've thought about it over and over again, I assure you, and I can perfectly explain everything that at first seemed as strange to me as it did to you.</t1097>
<t1098>Can he really do it?</t1098>
<t1099>—Yes.</t1099> <t1100>I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; but I know that you, Elinor, you who always like to doubt whenever you can, will not be satisfied; however, you will not be able to take away the certainty I have formed.</t1100> <t1101>I am convinced that Mrs. Smith suspects that he is interested in Marianne, disapproves of it (perhaps because she has other plans for him), and for that reason is anxious to send him away; and that the business she entrusted to him is an excuse invented to get him out of here.</t1101> <t1102>This is what I believe has happened.</t1102> <t1103>He is also aware that she positively disapproves of the union; consequently, for the moment he does not dare to confess his engagement to Marianne to her, and feels obliged, given his dependent situation, to yield to the plans she has made for him and leave Devonshire for a while.</t1103> <t1104>I know you will tell me that this may or may not have happened; but I will not listen to your speculations unless you show me another way to explain this matter as satisfactorily as the one I have presented to you.</t1104> <t1105>And now, Elinor, what can you say?</t1105>
<t1106>—Nothing, because you have anticipated my response.</t1106>
<t1107>—Then you would have told me that things could have happened this way, or not.</t1107> <t1108>Oh, Elinor!</t1108> <t1109>How incomprehensible your feelings are!</t1109> <t1110>You prefer to believe the bad before the good.</t1110> <t1111>You prefer to seek misfortune for Marianne and blame for poor Willoughby, rather than an excuse for him.</t1111> <t1112>You are determined to believe him guilty, because he bid us farewell with less affection than he has generally shown us.</t1112> <t1113>And is it not possible for you to make some allowance for thoughtlessness, or for a spirit depressed by recent disappointments?</t1113> <t1114>Can no probability be accepted, simply because it is not a certainty?</t1114> <t1115>Do we owe nothing to the man we have so many reasons to love, and none in the world to think ill of?</t1115> <t1116>Do we not owe it to him to be open to the possibility that there are unquestionable reasons in themselves, but inevitably secret for a time?</t1116> <t1117>And, after all, what do you make him suspect of?</t1117>
<t1118>—I’m not clear about it either.</t1118> <t1119>But it’s inevitable to suspect something unpleasant after seeing such a great disturbance as we observed in him.</t1119> <t1120>There is a great truth, however, in his insistence regarding the concessions we must make in his favor, and it is my desire to be impartial in all my judgments.</t1120> <t1121>It is undeniable that Willoughby may have sufficient reasons for having behaved this way, and I hope he does.</t1121> <t1122>But it would have been more in keeping with his character to have made them known.</t1122> <t1123>Reserve may be advisable, but even so, I cannot help but be surprised to find it in him.</t1123> <t1124>—</t1124>
<t1125>—Do not blame him, however, for straying from his nature where deviation is necessary.</t1125> <t1126>In any case, do you really admit the justice of what I have said in his defense?</t1126> <t1127>That makes me happy... and absolves him.</t1127>
<t1128>—Not completely.</t1128> <t1129>It may be appropriate to hide his engagement (if they are engaged) from Mrs. Smith; and if that is the case, it must be extremely convenient for Willoughby to be in Devonshire as little as possible at the moment.</t1129> <t1130>But that is no excuse to hide it from us.</t1130>
<t1131>—Hiding it from us!</t1131> <t1132>My dear girl, are you accusing Willoughby and Marianne of concealment?</t1132> <t1133>This is truly strange, when your eyes have accused them daily for their lack of caution.</t1133>
<t1134>—I have no lack of proof of his affection —said Elinor—, but I do lack proof of his commitment.</t1134>
<t1135>—I am satisfied with the ones I have from both.</t1135>
<t1136>—But neither of them has said a word to him about this matter.</t1136>
<t1137>—I have not needed words where actions have spoken for themselves with such clarity.</t1137> <t1138>His behavior towards Marianne and all of us, at least during the last fortnight, has it not made it clear that he loved her and considered her his future wife, and that he felt for us the affection one has for the closest relatives?</t1138> <t1139>Have we not understood each other perfectly?</t1139> <t1140>Has he not daily sought my consent through his looks, his manners, his affectionate and respectful attentions?</t1140> <t1141>Elinor, my daughter, is it possible to doubt his commitment?</t1141> <t1142>How could such an idea occur to you?</t1142> <t1143>It is impossible to suppose that Willoughby, convinced as he must be of your sister's love, would abandon her, and perhaps for months, without speaking to her of his love; impossible to think that they could part without exchanging these mutual expressions of trust.</t1143>
<t1144>—I confess —replied Elinor— that all the circumstances except one speak in favor of their engagement, but that one is their total silence on the matter, and for me, it almost nullifies all the others.</t1144>
<t1145>—How strange!</t1145> <t1146>You must certainly think the worst of Willoughby if, after everything that has happened between them in plain sight, you can doubt the nature of the ties that bind them.</t1146> <t1147>Has he been playing a role in front of your sister all this time?</t1147> <t1148>Do you truly believe he is indifferent to her?</t1148>
<t1149>—No, I can't believe such a thing.</t1149> <t1150>I'm sure that he must love her, and that he does love her.</t1150>
<t1151>—But with a rare kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, with such carelessness about the future as you attribute to him.</t1151>
<t1152>—You must remember, dear mother, that I have never taken these matters for certain.</t1152> <t1153>I confess that I have had my doubts; but they are less strong than they were, and they may very soon have disappeared completely.</t1153> <t1154>If we discover that they reciprocate in their love, all my fears will have vanished.</t1154>
<t1155>—Look at what a great concession!</t1155> <t1156>If you saw them at the altar, you would suppose they were getting married.</t1156> <t1157>What an unpleasant girl!</t1157> <t1158>But I don't need such proofs.</t1158> <t1159>Nothing, in my opinion, has happened to justify doubts; there have been no attempts to keep anything secret; everything has been equally transparent.</t1159> <t1160>You cannot have any doubts about your sister's wishes.</t1160> <t1161>Then it must be Willoughby you suspect.</t1161> <t1162>But why? Isn't he a man of honor and good feelings?</t1162> <t1163>Has he shown any inconsistency capable of creating alarm?</t1163> <t1164>Is he capable of deceit?</t1164>
<t1165>—I hope not, I think not —exclaimed Elinor—.</t1165> <t1166>I care for Willoughby, I sincerely care for him; and the suspicions about his integrity cannot be more painful for you than they are for me.</t1166> <t1167>I have done it unintentionally, and I will not fuel that tendency in myself.</t1167> <t1168>I was startled, I confess, by the change in his behavior that morning; when he spoke, he seemed like a different person from the one we knew, and he did not respond to the kindness you showed him with any sign of cordiality.</t1168> <t1169>But all this can be explained by being affected by some situation like the one you suppose.</t1169> <t1170>He had just parted from my sister, he had seen her leave in the greatest of afflictions; and if he felt obliged, for fear of offending Mrs. Smith, to resist the temptation to come back here later, and yet realized that by declining your invitation saying he was leaving for some time would seem to be acting in a petty and suspicious manner towards our family, he may well have felt ashamed and disturbed.</t1170> <t1171>In such a case, I believe that a simple and frank acknowledgment of his difficulties would have honored him more and would have been more consistent with his general character.</t1171> <t1172>But I will not criticize anyone's conduct on such weak grounds as a difference between their opinions and mine, or a deviation from what I consider correct and consistent.</t1172>
<t1173>—What you say is very good.</t1173> <t1174>There is no doubt that Willoughby does not deserve to be suspected.</t1174> <t1175>Although we have not known him for a long time, he is not a stranger in this part of the world; and who has spoken against him?</t1175> <t1176>If he had been in a position to act independently and marry immediately, it would have been strange for him to leave us without telling me everything at once; but that is not the case.</t1176> <t1177>It is an engagement initiated, in some respects, under unfavorable auspices, because the possibility of a wedding still seems far off; and even, from what is observed, it may be advisable to keep things secret for now.</t1177>
<t1178>They were interrupted by Margaret's entrance, which gave Elinor the freedom to carefully consider her mother's arguments, acknowledge that many of them were likely, and hope that all of them were correct.</t1178>
<t1179>They did not see Marianne until dinner time, when she entered the room and took her place at the table without uttering a word.</t1179> <t1180>Her eyes were red and swollen, and it seemed that even at that moment she was struggling to hold back tears.</t1180> <t1181>She avoided the others' glances, could neither eat nor converse, and after a while, when her mother silently squeezed her hand in a gesture of tender compassion, the small degree of strength she had maintained until then collapsed, she broke into tears and left the room.</t1181>
<t1182>This inexorable sadness continued throughout the entire afternoon.</t1182> <t1183>Marianne was powerless against it, because she lacked any desire to control herself.</t1183> <t1184>The slightest mention of anything related to Willoughby immediately overwhelmed all her resistance; and although her family was anxiously attentive to her well-being, if they began to speak, it was impossible for them to avoid all the topics that her feelings associated with the young man.</t1184>
<t1185>CHAPTER XVI</t1185>
<t1186>Marianne would not have known how to forgive herself if she had been able to sleep even for an instant that first night after Willoughby's departure.</t1186> <t1187>She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning if she had not risen from bed more in need of rest than when she lay down.</t1187> <t1188>But the same feelings that made circumspection undesirable freed her from any danger of falling into it.</t1188> <t1189>She was awake all night and cried for much of it.</t1189> <t1190>She rose with a headache, unable to speak and with no desire to take any food, distressing her mother and sisters at every moment and rejecting all their attempts at consolation.</t1190> <t1191>She was not going to show a lack of sensitivity!</t1191>
<t1192>Once breakfast was finished, she went out alone and wandered through the village of Allenham, surrendering to memories of past joys and weeping over the current setback of her fortune for most of the morning.</t1192>
<t1193>The afternoon passed in the same abandonment to feelings.</t1193> <t1194>She played each of the songs she liked and used to play for Willoughby, every tune in which their voices had most often joined, and she remained seated at the instrument contemplating each line of music he had copied for her, until the sorrow in her heart grew so great that no greater sadness could be reached; and day by day she strove to nurture her pain in this way.</t1194> <t1195>She spent entire hours at the piano alternating between singing and crying, often with her voice completely choked by tears.</t1195> <t1196>Also in books, as in music, she courted the misery that she could certainly obtain from the confrontation between the past and the present.</t1196> <t1197>She read nothing but what they used to read together.</t1197>
<t1198>Such burning anguish could not possibly be sustained forever; after a few days, it subsided into a more tranquil melancholy; but the activities he engaged in daily—his solitary walks and silent meditations—still gave rise to occasional outbursts of pain as intense as before.</t1198>
<t1199>No letter arrived from Willoughby, and it did not seem that Marianne was expecting any.</t1199> <t1200>Her mother was surprised, and Elinor once again became uneasy.</t1200> <t1201>But Mrs. Dashwood was capable of finding explanations whenever she needed them, which at least calmed her concern.</t1201>
<t1202>—Remember, Elinor —he said to her—, how often Sir John takes charge of delivering our mail.</t1202> <t1203>We agreed that secrecy might be necessary, and we must acknowledge that we couldn't maintain it if the correspondence between Willoughby and Marianne went through Sir John's hands.</t1203>
<t1204>Elinor could not deny the truth of the above and tried to find sufficient reason there for the silence of the young people.</t1204> <t1205>But there was such a direct, simple method, and in her opinion, so easy to adopt to know the true state of things and eliminate all the mystery at once, that she could not help but suggest it to her mother.</t1205>
<t1206>—Why don't you ask Marianne right away —he said to her— if she is or isn't engaged to Willoughby?</t1206> <t1207>Coming from you, her mother, and such a sweet and indulgent mother, the question cannot be bothersome.</t1207> <t1208>It would be a natural consequence of your affection for her.</t1208> <t1209>She used to be all frankness, and especially with you.</t1209>
<t1210>—For nothing in the world would I ask her such a question.</t1210> <t1211>Assuming it possible that they are not engaged, how much distress would I not inflict upon her by thus interrogating her!</t1211> <t1212>In any case, it would reveal such a great lack of consideration for her feelings.</t1212> <t1213>I could never deserve her trust again after forcing her to confess something that at the moment she does not want anyone to know.</t1213> <t1214>I know Marianne's heart: I know she loves me deeply and that I will not be the last one to whom she confides her affairs, when circumstances so advise.</t1214> <t1215>I would never try to force anyone's confidences, least of all a child's, because a sense of duty contrary to her desires would prevent her from refusing it.</t1215>
<t1216>Elinor thought that her generosity was excessive, considering her sister's youth, and insisted a little, but in vain; common sense, common zeal, and common prudence had all succumbed to Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.</t1216>
<t1217>Several days passed before anyone in the family mentioned Willoughby's name in front of Marianne; of course, Sir John and Mrs. Jennings were not so delicate; their witticisms added pain to many painful moments; but one afternoon, Mrs. Dashwood, picking up a volume of Shakespeare at random, exclaimed:</t1217>
<t1218>—We never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby left before we could read it all.</t1218> <t1219>We will reserve it, so that when he returns...</t1219> <t1220>But it may be months before that happens.</t1220>
<t1221>—Months! —he exclaimed, with enormous surprise—.</t1221> <t1222>No, not even many weeks.</t1222>
<t1223>Mrs. Dashwood regretted what she had said; but it cheered Elinor, as it had elicited a response from Marianne that so strongly demonstrated her confidence in Willoughby and her understanding of his intentions.</t1223>
<t1224>One morning, about a week after the young man's departure, Marianne allowed herself to be persuaded to join her sisters on their usual walk instead of wandering alone.</t1224> <t1225>Until that moment, she had carefully avoided all company during her wanderings.</t1225> <t1226>If her sisters thought of walking on the hills, she would slip away to the paths; if they mentioned the valley, with equal haste she would climb the hills, and they could never find her when the others set out.</t1226> <t1227>But in the end, Elinor's efforts, who strongly disapproved of this constant seclusion, prevailed.</t1227> <t1228>They walked along the road that crossed the valley, almost all the time in silence, because it was impossible to exert control over Marianne's mind; and Elinor, satisfied with having gained a point, did not attempt to gain any further advantage for the moment.</t1228> <t1229>Beyond the entrance to the valley, where the countryside, though still fertile, was less wild and more open, a long stretch of the road they had traveled upon arriving at Barton lay before them; and when they reached this point, they stopped to look around and examine the perspective given by the distance from which they saw their house, situated as they were in a place they had never thought to go in their previous walks.</t1229>
<t1230>Among all the things that populated the landscape, they soon discovered an animated object; it was a man on horseback, coming towards them.</t1230> <t1231>In a few minutes, they could see that he was a gentleman; and a moment later, enraptured, Marianne exclaimed:</t1231>
<t1232>—It's him!</t1232> <t1233>I'm sure it is... I know it is! —and she hurried to meet him when Elinor called her:</t1233>
<t1234>—No, Marianne, I think you are mistaken.</t1234> <t1235>It is not Willoughby.</t1235> <t1236>That person is not tall enough, and does not have his appearance.</t1236>
<t1237>—Yes, he has it, yes, he has it —exclaimed Marianne—.</t1237> <t1238>I'm sure he has it!</t1238> <t1239>His appearance, his coat, his horse...</t1239> <t1240>I knew he was going to arrive this quickly.</t1240>
<t1241>She walked full of excitement while talking; and Elinor, to protect Marianne from her own peculiarities, as she was almost sure it was not Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her.</t1241> <t1242>Soon they were thirty yards from the gentleman.</t1242> <t1243>Marianne looked at him again; she felt her heart sink, turned around, and began to retrace her steps when in her haste she was stopped by the voices of her sisters, joined by a third almost as familiar as Willoughby's, begging her to stop, and she turned in surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.</t1243>
<t1244>She was the only person in the world whom she could forgive at that moment for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have made her smile; but she wiped away her tears to smile at him, and in her sister's happiness, she forgot her own disappointment for a moment.</t1244>
<t1245>Edward dismounted and, handing the horse to his servant, walked back with them towards Barton, where he was heading with the purpose of visiting them.</t1245>
<t1246>They all welcomed her with great cordiality, but especially Marianne, who was warmer in her demonstrations of affection than even Elinor herself.</t1246> <t1247>For Marianne, however, the meeting between Edward and her sister was nothing but a continuation of that inexplicable coldness she had so often observed in the behavior of both at Norland.</t1247> <t1248>In Edward, especially, everything was lacking that a lover ought to seem and say on occasions like this.</t1248> <t1249>He was confused, barely showed any pleasure in seeing them, did not appear either exalted or joyful, spoke scarcely and only when he was obliged to answer questions, and did not distinguish Elinor through any sign of affection.</t1249> <t1250>Marianne watched and listened with growing surprise.</t1250> <t1251>She almost began to feel dislike for Edward; and this feeling ended, as all her feelings inevitably did, by bringing her thoughts back to Willoughby, whose manners contrasted so greatly with those of the one who had been chosen as a brother.</t1251>
<t1252>After a short silence that followed the surprise and initial questions, Marianne inquired of Edward if he had come directly from London.</t1252> <t1253>No, he had been in Devonshire for fifteen days.</t1253>
<t1254>—Fifteen days! —repeated Marianne, surprised to learn that she had been in the same county as Elinor without having seen her before.</t1254>
<t1255>Edward appeared somewhat uncomfortable as he added that he had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.</t1255>
<t1256>—Have you been to Sussex lately? —Elinor asked him.</t1256>
<t1257>—I was in Norland a month ago.</t1257>
<t1258>—And how is dear, dear Norland? —exclaimed Marianne.</t1258>
<t1259>—Dear, dear Norland —said Elinor— is probably quite similar to how it always is at this time of year... the woods and paths covered with a thick layer of dry leaves.</t1259>
<t1260>—Ah! —exclaimed Marianne—.</t1260> <t1261>How transported with emotion I used to feel then seeing them fall!</t1261> <t1262>How I delighted in my walks, watching them fall around me like rain driven by the wind!</t1262> <t1263>What emotions they inspired in me, and the season, the air, everything!</t1263> <t1264>Today, there is no one to watch them.</t1264> <t1265>They see them only as a nuisance, quickly sweep them away, and make them disappear from sight as best they can.</t1265>
<t1266>—Not everyone —said Elinor— shares your passion for dry leaves.</t1266>
<t1267>—No, my feelings are not usually shared, nor understood either.</t1267> <t1268>But sometimes they are —while saying this, he indulged for a moment in a brief reverie; but coming out of it, he continued—: Now, Edward —he said, drawing his attention to the landscape—, this is the Barton valley.</t1268> <t1269>Behold it, and stay calm if you can.</t1269> <t1270>Look at those hills!</t1270> <t1271>Have you ever seen anything like it?</t1271> <t1272>To the left is the estate, Barton Park, among those woods and plantations.</t1272> <t1273>You can see a corner of the house.</t1273> <t1274>And there, under that distant hill that rises with such grandeur, is our cottage.</t1274>
<t1275>—It is a beautiful region —he replied—; but these hollows must be full of mud in the winter.</t1275>
<t1276>—How can you think about the mud, with such things in front of you?</t1276>
<t1277>—Because —he replied, smiling— among all the things in front of me, I see a very muddy path.</t1277>
<t1278>"What a curious person!" Marianne said to herself as she continued on her way.</t1278>
<t1279>—Is the neighborhood pleasant here?</t1279> <t1280>Are the Middletons nice people?</t1280>
<t1281>—No, not at all —replied Marianne—, we couldn't be worse situated.</t1281>
<t1282>—Marianne —exclaimed her sister—, how can you say that?</t1282> <t1283>How can you be so unfair?</t1283> <t1284>They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars, and they have treated us in the most friendly manner possible.</t1284> <t1285>Have you forgotten, Marianne, how many pleasant days we owe them?</t1285>
<t1286>—No —said Marianne in a low voice—, nor how many painful moments.</t1286>
<t1287>Elinor did not listen to his words and, directing her attention to her visitor, she endeavored to maintain something that could resemble a conversation with him, for which she resorted to talking about her current residence, its advantages, and things like that, thereby managing to force out an occasional question or observation from him.</t1287> <t1288>His coldness and reserve mortified her greatly; she felt annoyed and somewhat angry; but determined to guide her conduct more by the past than by the present, she avoided any appearance of resentment or displeasure and treated him as she thought he should be treated, given the family ties.</t1288>
<t1289>CHAPTER XVII</t1289>
<t1290>The surprise of Mrs. Dashwood upon seeing him lasted only a moment; in her opinion, Edward's coming to Barton was the most natural thing in the world.</t1290> <t1291>Her joy and expressions of affection far exceeded any astonishment she might have felt.</t1291> <t1292>The young man received the kindest of welcomes from her; his shyness, coldness, and reserve could not withstand such a reception.</t1292> <t1293>They had already begun to abandon him before entering the house, and the charm of Mrs. Dashwood's manner finally overcame them.</t1293> <t1294>Indeed, a man could not fall in love with any of her daughters without also making her a participant in his love; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing how he soon began to behave as he truly was.</t1294> <t1295>His affection towards them and his interest in the well-being of all seemed to gain new life and become evident once more.</t1295> <t1296>He was not, however, in the best of spirits; he praised the house, admired the view, and was attentive and kind; but even so, he was not animated.</t1296> <t1297>The whole family noticed it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some lack of generosity on his mother's part, sat at the table indignant against all selfish parents.</t1297>
<t1298>What are Mrs. Ferrars' plans for you currently? —he asked after finishing dinner and once they were gathered around the fire—.</t1298> <t1299>Are you still expected to be a great orator, despite what you might wish?</t1299>
<t1300>—No.</t1300> <t1301>I hope my mother has already been convinced that my talents for public life are as scarce as my inclination towards it.</t1301>
<t1302>—But then, how will he achieve fame?</t1302> <t1303>Because he has to be famous to please his entire family; and without being inclined to a life of great expenses, without interest in people he doesn't know, without a profession and without having his future secured, it may be difficult for him to achieve it.</t1303>
<t1304>—I will not even try.</t1304> <t1305>I have no desire to be distinguished, and I have every imaginable reason to trust that I never will be.</t1305> <t1306>Thank God!</t1306> <t1307>I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence.</t1307>
<t1308>—He lacks ambition, that I know well.</t1308> <t1309>All his desires are moderate.</t1309>
<t1310>—I believe as moderate as those of the rest of the world.</t1310> <t1311>I desire, like everyone else, to be completely happy; but, like everyone else, it has to be in my own way.</t1311> <t1312>Greatness will not make me happy.</t1312>
<t1313>—It would be strange if he did! —exclaimed Marianne—.</t1313> <t1314>What do wealth or greatness have to do with happiness?</t1314>
<t1315>—Greatness, very little —said Elinor—; but wealth, a lot.</t1315>
<t1316>—Elinor, how shameful! —said Marianne—.</t1316> <t1317>Money can only bring happiness where there is nothing else that can provide it.</t1317> <t1318>Beyond a comfortable living, it cannot give real satisfaction, at least as far as the innermost being is concerned.</t1318>
<t1319>—Maybe —said Elinor, smiling—, we will come to the same conclusion.</t1319> <t1320>Your well-being and my wealth are very similar, I would say; and as things are going nowadays, we will agree that, without them, everything necessary for physical well-being will also be lacking.</t1320> <t1321>Your ideas are only more noble than mine.</t1321> <t1322>Come on, how much do you estimate a good well-being to be?</t1322>
<t1323>—Around eighteen hundred or two thousand pounds a year; no more than that.</t1323>
<t1324>Elinor burst out laughing.</t1324>
<t1325>– Two thousand a year! A thousand is what I call wealth!</t1325> <t1326>I already suspected how we would end up.</t1326>
<t1327>—Even so, two thousand a year is a very modest income —said Marianne—.</t1327> <t1328>A family cannot live on less.</t1328> <t1329>And I don't think I am being extravagant in my demands.</t1329> <t1330>An adequate staff of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunting dogs and horses cannot be maintained on less.</t1330>
<t1331>Elinor smiled again upon hearing her sister describe her future expenses in Combe Magna with such accuracy.</t1331>
<t1332>—Hunters with dogs and horses! —repeated Edward—.</t1332> <t1333>But why would you need them?</t1333> <t1334>Not everyone hunts.</t1334>
<t1335>Marianne blushed as she replied:</t1335>
<t1336>—But most people do.</t1336>
<t1337>—How I wish —said Margaret, letting her imagination run wild— that someone would give each of us a great fortune!</t1337>
<t1338>—Ah! If that were to happen! —exclaimed Marianne, her eyes shining with excitement and her cheeks glowing with the joy of that imaginary happiness.</t1338>
<t1339>—I suppose we all wish for it —said Elinor—, although wealth is not enough.</t1339>
<t1340>—Oh, heavens! —exclaimed Margaret—.</t1340> <t1341>How happy I would be!</t1341> <t1342>I can't imagine what I would do with that money!</t1342>
<t1343>Marianne seemed to have no doubt about it.</t1343>
<t1344>—For my part, I would not know how to spend a great fortune —said Mrs. Dashwood— if all my daughters were rich without my help.</t1344>
<t1345>—I should start with the improvements to this house —observed Elinor—, and all her difficulties would disappear immediately.</t1345>
<t1346>—What magnificent purchase orders would come from this family to London —said Edward— if that were to happen!</t1346> <t1347>What a happy day for the booksellers, the music vendors, and the print shops!</t1347> <t1348>You, Miss Dashwood, would place a general order to have every new quality print sent to you; and as for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul: there wouldn't be enough music in London to satisfy her.</t1348> <t1349>And books! Thomson, Cowper, Scott... she would buy them all over and over again; she would buy every copy, I believe, to prevent them from falling into unworthy hands; and she would have all the books that could teach her to admire an old twisted tree.</t1349> <t1350>Isn't that right, Marianne?</t1350> <t1351>Forgive me if I sounded somewhat caustic.</t1351> <t1352>But I wanted to show you that I haven't forgotten our old discussions.</t1352>
<t1353>—I love being reminded of the past, Edward; whether it is melancholic or joyful, I love being reminded of it; and you will never offend me by talking to me about past times.</t1353> <t1354>You are absolutely right in assuming how I would spend my money... part of it, at least my loose change, I would use it to enrich my collection of music and books.</t1354>
<t1355>—And the bulk of your fortune would go to annual pensions for the authors or their heirs.</t1355> <t1356>—No, Edward, I would do something else.</t1356>
<t1357>—Perhaps, then, you would donate it as a prize to the person who wrote the best defense of your favorite maxim, the one that says no one can fall in love more than once in a lifetime: because I suppose you haven't changed your mind on that point, have you?</t1357>
<t1358>—Without a doubt.</t1358> <t1359>At my age, opinions are tolerably solid.</t1359> <t1360>It doesn't seem likely that I will see or hear anything that will make me change them.</t1360>
<t1361>"You can see that Marianne is as determined as ever," said Elinor; "she hasn't changed at all."</t1361>
<t1362>—It's just a little worse than before.</t1362>
<t1363>—No, Edward —said Marianne—, you have nothing to reproach me for.</t1363> <t1364>You are not very cheerful either.</t1364>
<t1365>—What makes you think that! —replied the young man, with a sigh—.</t1365> <t1366>But joy was never part of my character.</t1366>
<t1367>—Nor do I consider her part of Marianne's —said Elinor—.</t1367> <t1368>I would hardly call her a girl of great vivacity; she is very intense, very vehement in everything she does; sometimes she talks a lot, and always with great animation... but it is not often that you see her truly cheerful.</t1368>
<t1369>—I believe you are right —replied Edward—; and yet, I have always considered her a very lively girl.</t1369>
<t1370>—I have often found myself making that kind of mistake —said Elinor—, with completely false ideas about someone's character at some point or another; imagining people to be much more cheerful or serious, more witty or stupid than they really are, and it is difficult for me to say why, or where the deception originated.</t1370> <t1371>Sometimes one is guided by what people say about themselves, and very often by what others say about them, without taking the time to deliberate and discern.</t1371>
<t1372>—But I thought it was right, Elinor —said Marianne— to be completely guided by the opinions of others.</t1372> <t1373>I thought we were given discernment simply to subordinate it to that of our neighbors.</t1373> <t1374>I am sure this has always been your doctrine.</t1374>
<t1375>—No, Marianne, never.</t1375> <t1376>My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of understanding.</t1376> <t1377>Behavior is the only thing I have wanted to influence.</t1377> <t1378>You must not confuse the meaning of what I say.</t1378> <t1379>I confess to having often wished that you would treat our acquaintances in general with greater courtesy; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or conform to their way of judging things in serious matters?</t1379>
<t1380>—Then he hasn't been able to incorporate his sister into his general courtesy plan —said Edward to Elinor—.</t1380> <t1381>Hasn't he gained any ground?</t1381>
<t1382>—Quite the contrary —replied Elinor, with an expressive look at Marianne.</t1382>
<t1383>—My thoughts —he replied— are in complete agreement with yours; but I fear that my actions align much more with those of your sister.</t1383> <t1384>It is never my intention to offend, but I am so foolishly shy that I often appear inattentive when it is only my natural clumsiness that holds me back.</t1384> <t1385>I have often thought that, by nature, I must have been destined to like people of low status, for I feel so uncomfortable among people of good birth when they are strangers to me!</t1385>
<t1386>—Marianne cannot excuse herself with shyness for the inattentions she may commit —said Elinor.</t1386>
<t1387>—She knows her own worth too well for false modesty —replied Edward—.</t1387> <t1388>Shyness is only the effect of a feeling of inferiority in one aspect or another.</t1388> <t1389>If I could convince myself that my manners are perfectly natural and elegant, I would not be shy.</t1389>
<t1390>—But even so, he would be reserved —said Marianne—, and that is worse.</t1390>
<t1391>Edward stared at her intently.</t1391>
<t1392>—Reserved? Am I reserved, Marianne?</t1392>
<t1393>—Yes, very much.</t1393>
<t1394>—I don't understand you —he replied, blushing—.</t1394> <t1395>Reserved...! How, in what sense?</t1395> <t1396>What should I have told them? What do you suppose?</t1396>
<t1397>Elinor seemed surprised by such an emotionally charged response, but trying to downplay the seriousness of the matter, she said to her:</t1397>
<t1398>—Doesn't he know my sister well enough to understand what she says?</t1398> <t1399>Doesn't he know that she calls reserved anyone who doesn't speak as quickly as she does or admire what she admires, and with the same ecstasy?</t1399>
<t1400>Edward did not respond.</t1400> <t1401>That grave and contemplative air that was so characteristic of him returned, and for a while he remained there seated, silent and somber.</t1401>
<t1402>CHAPTER XVIII</t1402>
<t1403>Elinor contemplated with great unease the downcast spirits of her friend.</t1403> <t1404>The satisfaction that his visit offered her was quite partial, since the pleasure he himself obtained seemed so imperfect.</t1404> <t1405>It was evident that he was unhappy, and she would have wished it to be equally evident that he still distinguished her with the same affection that she was once sure she had inspired in him; but so far it seemed very doubtful that he continued to prefer her, and his reserved attitude towards her contradicted in an instant what a more animated look had suggested the previous minute.</t1405>
<t1406>The next morning he accompanied her and Marianne at the breakfast table before the others had come down; and Marianne, always eager to promote, as much as she could, the happiness of both, soon left them alone.</t1406> <t1407>But she was not yet halfway down the stairs when she heard the door of the room open and, turning around, was astonished to see that Edward was also coming out.</t1407>
<t1408>I'm going to the village to see my horses —he said—, since you're not ready for breakfast yet; I'll be back very soon.</t1408>
<t1409>Edward returned with renewed admiration for the surrounding region; his walk to the village had been a favorable occasion to see much of the valley; and the village itself, situated much higher than the house, offered a general view of the entire place that had pleased him greatly.</t1409> <t1410>This was a topic that ensured Marianne's attention, and she began to describe her own admiration for these landscapes and to question him in more detail about the things that had especially impressed him, when Edward interrupted her by saying:</t1410>
<t1411>—You must not inquire too much, Marianne; remember, I know nothing of the picturesque, and I will offend you with my ignorance and lack of taste if we go into details.</t1411> <t1412>I will call hills steep that ought to be craggy!</t1412> <t1413>Unusual and coarse surfaces, which ought to be whimsical and rough; and of distant objects I will say they are out of sight, when they should only be hazy through the soft glass of the misty atmosphere.</t1413> <t1414>You must be content with the kind of admiration I can honestly offer.</t1414> <t1415>I call it a very beautiful region: the hills are steep, the woods seem full of excellent timber, and the valley looks comfortable and cozy, with rich meadows and several neat farmhouses scattered here and there.</t1415> <t1416>It exactly matches my idea of a pleasant countryside, because it combines beauty and utility... and I would also say it is picturesque, because you admire it; I can easily believe it is full of rocks and promontories, gray moss and brambles, but all that is lost on me.</t1416> <t1417>I know nothing of picturesqueness.</t1417>
<t1418>—I'm afraid there's too much truth in that —said Marianne—; but why boast about it?</t1418>
<t1419>—I suspect —said Elinor— that to avoid falling into one type of affectation, Edward falls here into another.</t1419> <t1420>As he believes that so many people pretend to have much greater admiration for the beauties of nature than they truly feel, and such pretensions displease him, he affects greater indifference towards the landscape and less discernment than he actually possesses.</t1420> <t1421>He is exquisite and wants to have an affectation unique to himself.</t1421>
<t1422>—It is very true —said Marianne— that admiration for natural landscapes has become mere jargon.</t1422> <t1423>Everyone pretends to admire and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of the first person who defined what picturesque beauty was.</t1423> <t1424>I detest jargons of any kind, and at times I have kept my feelings to myself because I could not find any other language to describe them than that which has been worn out and handled until it has lost all sense and meaning.</t1424>
<t1425>—I am convinced —said Edward— that in front of a beautiful landscape you truly feel all the pleasure you say you feel.</t1425> <t1426>But, in return, your sister must allow me not to feel more than I declare.</t1426> <t1427>I like a beautiful view, but not according to the principles of the picturesque.</t1427> <t1428>I do not like gnarled, twisted, withered trees.</t1428> <t1429>My admiration is much greater when they are tall, straight, and in bloom.</t1429> <t1430>I do not like ruined, dilapidated cottages.</t1430> <t1431>I am not fond of nettles or thistles or heaths.</t1431> <t1432>A cozy farmhouse gives me much more pleasure than a watchtower; and a group of neat and happy villagers pleases me much more than the best bandits in the world.</t1432>
<t1433>Marianne looked at Edward with eyes full of surprise, and at her sister with pity.</t1433> <t1434>Elinor merely laughed.</t1434>
<t1435>They abandoned the topic, and Marianne remained in thoughtful silence until suddenly an object captured her attention.</t1435> <t1436>She was sitting next to Edward, and when he took the cup of tea that Mrs. Dashwood offered him, his hand passed so close to her that she couldn't help but notice, very visible on one of his fingers, a ring that had intertwined hair in the center.</t1436>
<t1437>—I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward —she exclaimed—.</t1437> <t1438>Do those hairs belong to Fanny?</t1438> <t1439>I remember she promised to give you some.</t1439> <t1440>But I would have thought her hair was darker.</t1440>
<t1441>Marianne had expressed without much reflection what she truly felt; but when she saw how much it had upset Edward, her own annoyance at her lack of consideration was greater than the discomfort he felt.</t1441> <t1442>He blushed deeply and, casting a quick glance at Elinor, replied:</t1442>
<t1443>—Yes, it's my sister's hair.</t1443> <t1444>The setting always gives it a different hue, you know.</t1444>
<t1445>Elinor's gaze had crossed with his, and she also seemed disturbed.</t1445> <t1446>Immediately, she thought, just like Marianne, that the hair belonged to him; the only difference between their conclusions was that what Marianne believed to be a gift voluntarily given by her sister, for Elinor had been obtained through some theft or maneuver she was unaware of.</t1446> <t1447>However, she was not in the mood to consider it an affront, and while she changed the conversation pretending not to have noticed what had happened, she resolved internally to take advantage of every opportunity from then on to look at that hair and convince herself, beyond any doubt, that it was the same color as hers.</t1447>
<t1448>Edward's perturbation lasted for some time, and it ultimately led him to an even more pronounced state of abstraction.</t1448> <t1449>He was especially serious throughout the entire morning.</t1449> <t1450>Marianne reproached herself in the severest manner for what she had said; but she would have forgiven herself much more quickly if she had known how little she had offended her sister.</t1450>
<t1451>Before noon, they received a visit from Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard about the visit of a gentleman to the cottage, came to take a look at the guest.</t1451> <t1452>With the help of his mother-in-law, Sir John soon discovered that the name Ferrars began with F, and this left open for the future a vein of jokes against the upright Elinor that they did not immediately exploit only because they had just met Edward.</t1452> <t1453>At the moment, only the expressive glances exchanged gave Elinor an indication of how far their insight had gone, based on Margaret's hints.</t1453>
<t1454>Sir John never arrived at the Dashwoods' home without inviting them either to dine at the estate the next day or to have tea with them that same afternoon.</t1454> <t1455>On the current occasion, for the distraction of his guest to whose entertainment he felt obliged to contribute, he wanted to commit them to both.</t1455>
<t1456>– You have to have tea with us today —he told them—, because we will be completely alone; and tomorrow you must have dinner with us anyway, because we will be quite a large group.</t1456>
<t1457>Mrs. Jennings emphasized the urgency of the situation by saying:</t1457>
<t1458>—And how do they know if they don't organize a dance?</t1458> <t1459>And that will surely tempt you, Miss Marianne.</t1459>
<t1460>—A dance! protested Marianne—.</t1460> <t1461>Impossible! Who is going to dance?</t1461>
<t1462>—Who! But you, and the Careys and the Whitakers, for sure.</t1462> <t1463>What!</t1463> <t1464>Did you think no one could dance because a certain person whom we won't name has left?</t1464>
<t1465>—With all my heart —exclaimed Sir John— I wish Willoughby were among us again.</t1465>
<t1466>This, and Marianne's blush, aroused new suspicions in Edward.</t1466>
<t1467>—And who is Willoughby? —he asked Miss Dashwood in a low voice, by whose side he was standing.</t1467>
<t1468>Elinor replied to her in a few words.</t1468> <t1469>Marianne's countenance was much more communicative.</t1469> <t1470>Edward saw enough in it to understand not only the meaning of what the others were saying, but also Marianne's expressions that had previously confused him; and when their visitors had left, he immediately turned to her and, in a whisper, said:</t1470>
<t1471>—I have been making guesses.</t1471> <t1472>Shall I tell you what I think I have guessed?</t1472>
<t1473>—What do you mean?</t1473>
<t1474>—Shall I tell you?</t1474>
<t1475>—Of course.</t1475>
<t1476>—Well then, I guess that Mr. Willoughby practices hunting.</t1476>
<t1477>Marianne felt surprised and disturbed, but she couldn't help smiling at such calm subtlety and, after a moment of silence, she said to him:</t1477>
<t1478>—Oh, Edward!</t1478> <t1479>How can you...?</t1479> <t1480>But the day will come, I hope... I'm sure you will like it.</t1480>
<t1481>—I don't doubt it —he replied, with a certain astonishment at the intensity and warmth of her words; for if he had not imagined that it was a joke made for the amusement of all their acquaintances, based on nothing more than something or nothing between Mr. Willoughby and her, he would not have dared to mention it.</t1481>
<t1482>CHAPTER XIX</t1482>
<t1483>Edward stayed a week at the cottage; Mrs. Dashwood urged him to stay longer, but as if he only wished to mortify himself, he seemed determined to leave when he was having the best time among his friends.</t1483> <t1484>His mood in the last two or three days, although still quite unstable, had greatly improved; day by day he seemed to grow more fond of the house and its surroundings, he never spoke of leaving without accompanying his words with sighs, he claimed he had complete control over his time, he even doubted where he would go when he left... but still, he had to go.</t1484> <t1485>Never had a week passed so quickly, he could hardly believe he was already gone.</t1485> <t1486>He said it over and over again; he also said other things, which indicated the direction of his feelings and contradicted his actions.</t1486> <t1487>Nothing pleased him at Norland, he detested the city, but to either Norland or London he had to go.</t1487> <t1488>He valued above all else the kindness he had received from all of them and his greatest joy was being in their company.</t1488> <t1489>And yet he had to leave them at the end of that week, despite the wishes of both parties and with no restrictions on his time.</t1489>
<t1490>Elinor attributed everything surprising in Edward's behavior to his mother; and it was fortunate for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known as to serve as a general excuse for all the strange things in her son.</t1490> <t1491>However, disillusioned and annoyed as she was, and sometimes displeased with the young man's wavering behavior towards her, she still had the best general disposition to grant his actions the same sincere concessions and generous qualifications that had been more reluctantly granted by Mrs. Dashwood when it came to Willoughby.</t1491> <t1492>His lack of spirit, frankness, and consistency was generally attributed to his lack of independence and a better understanding of Mrs. Ferrars' dispositions and plans.</t1492> <t1493>The brevity of his visit, the firmness of his purpose to leave, originated from the same assault on his inclinations, the same inevitable necessity to comply with his mother.</t1493> <t1494>The old and well-known dispute between duty and desire, parents against children, was the cause of it all.</t1494> <t1495>Elinor would have been glad to know when these difficulties would end, when this opposition would cease... when Mrs. Ferrars would change, leaving her son free to be happy.</t1495> <t1496>But from such vain wishes she was obliged to return, to find comfort, in the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection; in the memory of all the signs of interest that his looks or words had let slip while they were at Barton; and, above all, in that flattering proof of it that he constantly wore around his finger.</t1496>
<t1497>—I believe, Edward —said Mrs. Dashwood while they were having breakfast on the last morning—, that you would be happier if you had a profession that occupied your time and gave interest to your plans and actions.</t1497> <t1498>It might not be entirely convenient for your friends: you wouldn't be able to give them as much of your time.</t1498> <t1499>But —she added with a smile— you would benefit in at least one aspect: you would know where to go when you leave them.</t1499>
<t1500>—I assure you —he replied— that I have thought a lot about this point in the same way you are doing now.</t1500> <t1501>It has been, is, and probably always will be a great misfortune for me not to have had any occupation to which I was obliged to dedicate myself, no profession that gives me employment or offers me something in the line of independence.</t1501> <t1502>But, unfortunately, my own ability to behave in a genteel manner, and the gentility of my friends, have made me what I am: an idle, incompetent being.</t1502> <t1503>We could never agree on the choice of a profession.</t1503> <t1504>I always preferred the church, as I still do.</t1504> <t1505>But that was not elegant enough for my family.</t1505> <t1506>They recommended a military career.</t1506> <t1507>That was too, too elegant for me.</t1507> <t1508>As for the practice of law, they graciously considered it a fairly respectable profession; many young men with offices in some London Inns of Court have achieved a very good entry into the most important circles, and stroll around the city driving very fashionable carriages.</t1508> <t1509>But I had no inclination for the law, not even in this much less abstruse form of it that my family approved of.</t1509> <t1510>As for the navy, it had the advantage of being in good taste, but I was already too old to join it when the subject was first discussed; and, in the end, since there was no real need for me to have a profession, given that I could be just as dashing and extravagant with a red coat on my shoulders or without it, it was decided that idleness was the most advantageous and honorable; and at eighteen young men are generally not so eager to have an occupation as to resist the invitations of their friends to do nothing.</t1510> <t1511>I therefore entered Oxford, and since then I have been idle, just as one should be.</t1511>
<t1512>"—The consequence of all this will be, I suppose," said Mrs. Dashwood, "since indolence has brought you no happiness, that you will raise your children to have as many interests, employments, professions, and tasks as Columella."</t1512> <t1513>3</t1513>
<t1514>—They will be raised —he replied gravely— to be as different from me as possible, in feelings, actions, condition, in everything.</t1514>
<t1515>—Come on, come on, all of that is nothing more than the product of your discouragement, Edward.</t1515> <t1516>You are in a mood, and you imagine that anyone who is not like you must be happy.</t1516> <t1517>But remember that at some point everyone will feel the pain of parting from friends, no matter what their education or status.</t1517> <t1518>Be aware of your own happiness.</t1518> <t1519>You lack nothing but patience... or, to give it a more attractive name, call it hope.</t1519> <t1520>In time your mother will guarantee you that independence you so desire; it is her duty, and very soon her happiness will be, must be, to prevent all your youth from being wasted in discontent.</t1520> <t1521>How much can a few months do!</t1521>
<t1522>—I believe —replied Edward— that it will take many months for something good to happen to me.</t1522>
<t1523>This discouragement, although it could not be transmitted to Mrs. Dashwood, increased the pain of all of them due to Edward's departure, which took place very soon, and left an uncomfortable feeling especially in Elinor, who needed time and effort to calm down.</t1523> <t1524>But as she had decided to overcome it and avoid appearing to suffer more than the rest of her family at the young man's departure, she did not use the means so judiciously employed by Marianne on a similar occasion, when she resorted to seeking silence, solitude, and idleness to increase and make her suffering permanent.</t1524> <t1525>Their methods were as different as their particular objectives, and equally suited to achieving them.</t1525>
<t1526>As soon as Edward left, Elinor sat down at her drawing table, kept herself busy all day, neither sought nor avoided mentioning his name, seemed to show the same interest as always in the general concerns of the family, and if with this conduct she did not lessen her own distress, at least she prevented it from increasing unnecessarily, and her mother and sisters were spared many worries on her account.</t1526>
<t1527>Such behavior, so exactly opposite to hers, did not seem to Marianne any more commendable than her own had seemed to her.</t1527> <t1528>As for the matter of self-control, she accounted for it quite easily: if it was impossible when feelings were strong, with calm ones it had no merit.</t1528> <t1529>That her sister's feelings were calm, she did not dare to deny, although she was ashamed to admit it; and she had incontrovertible proof of the strength of her own, since she continued to love and respect that sister despite this humiliating conviction.</t1529>
<t1530>Without avoiding her family or leaving the house in voluntary solitude to escape them or staying awake all night to indulge in her musings, Elinor found that each day offered her enough time to think about Edward, and about Edward's behavior, in all the ways that her different moods at different times could produce: with tenderness, pity, approval, censure, and doubt.</t1530> <t1531>There were plenty of moments when, if not due to the absence of her mother and sisters, at least due to the nature of their occupations, all conversation between them was rendered impossible, and all the effects of solitude ensued.</t1531> <t1532>Her mind was inevitably set free; her thoughts could not be chained to anything else; and the past and the future related to such an interesting subject could not help but become present to her, force her attention, and absorb her memory, her reflections, her imagination.</t1532>
<t1533>From a daydream of this kind, to which she had surrendered while sitting at her drawing table, she was awakened one morning, shortly after Edward's departure, by the arrival of some visitors.</t1533> <t1534>By chance, she was alone.</t1534> <t1535>The noise made by the small gate at the entrance of the garden in front of the house as it closed drew her gaze to the window, and she saw a large group of people heading towards the door.</t1535> <t1536>Among them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings; but there were two others, a gentleman and a lady, who were completely unknown to her.</t1536> <t1537>She was sitting near the window and as soon as Sir John saw her, he let the rest of the party go through the formality of knocking on the door and, crossing the lawn, had her open the window to converse in private, although the space between the door and the window was so small as to make it almost impossible to speak at one without being heard at the other.</t1537>
<t1538>—Well—he said—, we have brought you some strangers.</t1538> <t1539>Do you like them?</t1539>
<t1540>—Shhh! They can hear it.</t1540>
<t1541>—What does it matter if they do.</t1541> <t1542>They are just the Palmers.</t1542> <t1543>I can tell you that Charlotte is very pretty.</t1543> <t1544>You will be able to see her if you look over here.</t1544>
<t1545>Since Elinor was sure she would see her in a couple of minutes without having to take such a liberty, she asked to be excused from doing so.</t1545>
<t1546>—Where is Marianne?</t1546> <t1547>Has she fled upon seeing us coming?</t1547> <t1548>I see that her instrument is open.</t1548>
<t1549>—He went out for a walk, I think.</t1549>
<t1550>At that moment, Mrs. Jennings joined them, who did not have enough patience to wait for the door to be opened before she told her story.</t1550> <t1551>She approached the window with great greetings:</t1551>
<t1552>—How are you, dear? How is Mrs. Dashwood? And where are your sisters?</t1552> <t1553>What! They have left you alone!</t1553> <t1554>You will be pleased to have someone to keep you company.</t1554> <t1555>I have brought my other son and daughter to meet you.</t1555> <t1556>Imagine, they arrived suddenly!</t1556> <t1557>Last night I thought I heard a carriage while we were having tea, but it never crossed my mind that it could be them.</t1557> <t1558>The only thing that occurred to me was that it could be Colonel Brandon returning; so I said to Sir John: "I think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon returning..."</t1558>
<t1559>In the middle of her story, Elinor was forced to turn around to receive the rest of the company; Lady Middleton introduced her to the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret were coming down the stairs at that very moment, and everyone sat down to look at each other while Mrs. Jennings continued with her story as she crossed the corridor to the sitting room, accompanied by Sir John.</t1559>
<t1560>Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and completely different from her in various aspects.</t1560> <t1561>She was short and plump, with a very pretty face and the greatest expression of good humor imaginable.</t1561> <t1562>Her manners were not at all as elegant as her sister's, but much more pleasant.</t1562> <t1563>She entered with a smile, smiled throughout her entire visit, except when she laughed, and continued smiling as she left.</t1563> <t1564>Her husband was a young man of serious demeanor, twenty-five or twenty-six years old, with a more urban and judicious air than his wife, but less eager to please or be pleased.</t1564> <t1565>He entered the room with an air of feeling very important, made a slight bow to the ladies without saying a word and, after a brief inspection of them and their quarters, took a newspaper from the table and remained reading it throughout the visit.</t1565>
<t1566>Mrs. Palmer, on the other hand, whom nature had endowed with a disposition to be invariably courteous and happy, had scarcely taken her seat when she burst into exclamations of admiration for the room and everything in it.</t1566>
<t1567>—Look! What a delightful room this is!</t1567> <t1568>I have never seen anything so charming!</t1568> <t1569>Just think, mother, how much it has improved since the last time I was here!</t1569> <t1570>It always seemed such an exquisite place to me, madam —she said, turning to Mrs. Dashwood—, but you have given it so much charm!</t1570> <t1571>Just observe, sister, what a delight everything is!</t1571> <t1572>How I would love to have a house like this.</t1572> <t1573>And you, Mr. Palmer?</t1573>
<t1574>Mr. Palmer did not respond to her, and he didn't even look up from the newspaper.</t1574>
<t1575>—Mr. Palmer doesn't listen to me —she said, laughing—.</t1575> <t1576>Sometimes he never does.</t1576> <t1577>He's so funny!</t1577>
<t1578>This was an absolutely new idea for Mrs. Dashwood; she was not accustomed to finding wit in anyone's lack of attention, and could not help but look at both with surprise.</t1578>
<t1579>Mrs. Jennings, meanwhile, kept talking loudly and continued with the story of the surprise they had experienced the previous night upon seeing their friends, and did not stop until she had recounted everything.</t1579> <t1580>Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the memory of the astonishment they had caused, and everyone agreed two or three times that it had been a pleasant surprise.</t1580>
<t1581>—You can imagine how happy we all were to see them —added Mrs. Jennings, leaning towards Elinor and speaking in a low voice, as if she intended no one else to hear, although they were sitting at opposite ends of the room—, but even so, I can't help but wish they hadn't traveled so fast or made such a long journey, because they went all the way around London due to some business, because, you know —she indicated her daughter with an expressive nod of her head—, it's inconvenient in her condition.</t1581> <t1582>I wanted her to stay home and rest this morning, but she insisted on coming with us; she was so eager to see all of you!</t1582>
<t1583>Mrs. Palmer laughed and said it wouldn't do any harm.</t1583>
<t1584>—She expects to be in labor in February —continued Mrs. Jennings.</t1584>
<t1585>Mrs. Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and she made an effort to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the newspaper.</t1585>
<t1586>—No, none —he replied, and continued reading.</t1586>
<t1587>—Here comes Marianne —exclaimed Sir John —. Now, Palmer, you will see a monstrously pretty girl.</t1587>
<t1588>He immediately went to the hallway, opened the front door, and escorted her himself.</t1588> <t1589>As soon as she appeared, Mrs. Jennings asked if she had been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question as if she had understood it.</t1589> <t1590>Mr. Palmer looked at her when she entered the room, stared at her for a few moments, and then returned to his newspaper.</t1590> <t1591>At that moment, Mrs. Palmer's attention was drawn to the drawings hanging on the walls.</t1591> <t1592>She got up to examine them.</t1592>
<t1593>—Oh, heavens! How beautiful these are! Wow, how gorgeous!</t1593> <t1594>Look at them, mom, how adorable!</t1594> <t1595>I'm telling you, they are a delight; I could stay watching them forever —and sitting down again, she very soon forgot that there were such things in the room.</t1595>
<t1596>When Lady Middleton got up to leave, Mr. Palmer did the same, put down the newspaper, stretched, and looked around at everyone.</t1596>
<t1597>—My love, have you been sleeping? —said his wife, laughing.</t1597>
<t1598>He did not respond and merely observed, after examining the room again, that it had a very low ceiling and that the plaster was sagging.</t1598> <t1599>After which he nodded his head and left with the others.</t1599>
<t1600>Sir John had insisted that they spend the next day at Barton Park.</t1600> <t1601>Mrs. Dashwood, who preferred not to dine with them more often than they did at the cottage, absolutely refused; her daughters could do as they pleased.</t1601> <t1602>But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer dined, and the prospect of being with them promised no other amusement.</t1602> <t1603>They thus tried to excuse themselves as well; the weather was unstable and did not promise to improve.</t1603> <t1604>But Sir John was not satisfied: he would send the carriage to fetch them, and they must go.</t1604> <t1605>Lady Middleton also, though she did not press Mrs. Dashwood, did so with the daughters.</t1605> <t1606>Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their pleas; everyone seemed equally anxious to avoid a family gathering, and the young women were forced to yield.</t1606>
<t1607>.</t1607> <t1608>"Why do they have to invite us?" said Marianne as soon as they left.</t1608> <t1609>"The rent for this little house is considered low; but the conditions are very harsh if we have to go dine at the estate every time someone is staying with them or with us."</t1609>
<t1610>—They do not intend to be less courteous and kind to us now, with these continuous invitations —said Elinor— than they were with those we received a few weeks ago.</t1610> <t1611>If their gatherings have become tedious and dull, it is not they who have changed.</t1611> <t1612>We must look for that change elsewhere.</t1612>
<t1613>CHAPTER XX</t1613>
<t1614>The next day, at the moment when the Misses Dashwood were entering the drawing room of Barton Park through one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in through the other, with the same cheerful and festive air they had seen before.</t1614> <t1615>She took their hands with great displays of affection and expressed great pleasure in seeing them again.</t1615>
<t1616>—I am happy to see you! —she said, sitting between Elinor and Marianne— because the day is so ugly that I feared you wouldn't come, which would have been terrible, since we are leaving here tomorrow.</t1616> <t1617>We have to leave, you know, because the Westons are arriving at our house next week.</t1617> <t1618>Our coming here was very sudden and I had no idea we would do it until the carriage was arriving at the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton.</t1618> <t1619>It's so funny!</t1619> <t1620>He never tells me anything!</t1620> <t1621>I'm so sorry we can't stay longer; but I hope we will meet again very soon in the city.</t1621>
<t1622>Elinor and Marianne were forced to curb such expectations.</t1622>
<t1623>—They are not going to the city! —exclaimed Mrs. Palmer with a smile—.</t1623> <t1624>I will be enormously disappointed if they don't.</t1624> <t1625>I could get them the most beautiful house in the world next to ours, in Hanover Square.</t1625> <t1626>They have to go, in any case.</t1626> <t1627>Believe me, I will be happy to accompany them at any time until I am about to give birth, if Mrs. Dashwood doesn't like going to public places.</t1627>
<t1628>They thanked him, but they were forced to resist his pleas.</t1628>
<t1629>"Oh, my love!" exclaimed Mrs. Palmer, addressing her husband who had just entered the room.</t1629> <t1630>"You have to help me convince the Miss Dashwoods to go to the city this winter."</t1630>
<t1631>His love did not respond; and after bowing slightly to the ladies, he began to complain about the weather.</t1631>
<t1632>—How horrible all this is! —he said—.</t1632> <t1633>Such weather makes everything and everyone unpleasant.</t1633> <t1634>With the rain, boredom invades everything, both indoors and outdoors.</t1634> <t1635>It makes one detest all their acquaintances.</t1635> <t1636>What the devil is Sir John thinking by not having a billiard room in this house?</t1636> <t1637>How few know what comfort is!</t1637> <t1638>Sir John is as stupid as the weather.</t1638>
<t1639>It wasn't long before the rest of the attendees arrived.</t1639>
<t1640>—I fear, Miss Marianne —said Sir John —, that you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today.</t1640>
<t1641>Marianne put on a very serious face and said nothing.</t1641>
<t1642>—Ah, don't pretend so much with us —said Mrs. Palmer—, because I assure you that we know everything about it; and I greatly admire your taste, as I think he is extremely handsome.</t1642> <t1643>You know, we don't live very far from him in the countryside; I would dare to say no more than ten miles.</t1643>
<t1644>—Much more, around thirty —said her husband.</t1644>
<t1645>—Ah, well!</t1645> <t1646>There isn't much difference.</t1646> <t1647>I've never been to his house, but they say it's a delightful place, very lovely.</t1647>
<t1648>—One of the most detestable places I have seen in my life —said Mr. Palmer.</t1648>
<t1649>Marianne remained in perfect silence, although her expression betrayed her interest in what was being said.</t1649>
<t1650>—Is it very ugly? —continued Mrs. Palmer—.</t1650> <t1651>Then I suppose it must be another place that is so beautiful.</t1651>
<t1652>When they sat at the table, Sir John observed with sadness that there were only eight of them altogether.</t1652>
<t1653>—Dear —he said to his wife—, it is very annoying that we are so few.</t1653> <t1654>Why didn't you invite the Gilberts to have dinner with us today?</t1654>
<t1655>—Didn't I tell you, sir John, when you mentioned it to me before, that it was impossible?</t1655> <t1656>Last time, they were the ones who came here.</t1656>
<t1657>—You and I, Sir John —said Mrs. Jennings— would not stand on so much ceremony.</t1657>
<t1658>—Then she would be very rude —exclaimed Mr. Palmer.</t1658>
<t1659>—My love, you contradict everyone —said his wife, with her usual laugh—.</t1659> <t1660>Do you know that you are quite rude?</t1660>
<t1661>—I didn't know I was contradicting anyone by calling your mother ill-mannered.</t1661>
<t1662>—Yes, yes, you can treat me as badly as you want —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings with her usual good humor—.</t1662> <t1663>You have taken Charlotte off my hands, and you cannot give her back.</t1663> <t1664>So now you are taking it out on me.</t1664>
<t1665>Charlotte laughed heartily at the thought that her husband could not get rid of her, and cheerfully said that she did not care how irritable he was towards her, they still had to live together.</t1665> <t1666>No one could have such an absolutely good temperament or be as determined to be happy as Mrs. Palmer.</t1666> <t1667>Her husband's studied indifference, insolence, and contrariness did not upset her; and when he got angry with her or treated her poorly, she seemed enormously amused.</t1667>
<t1668>—Mr. Palmer is so funny! —she whispered to Elinor—.</t1668> <t1669>He is always in a bad mood.</t1669>
<t1670>After observing him for a brief period, Elinor was not so inclined to give him credit for being as genuinely and naturally ill-tempered and ill-mannered as he wished to appear.</t1670> <t1671>It might be that his temper had soured somewhat upon discovering, like so many others of his sex, that due to an inexplicable prejudice in favor of beauty, he found himself married to a very foolish woman; but she knew that this kind of folly was too common for a sensible man to be affected by it for long.</t1671> <t1672>Rather, it was a desire for distinction, she believed, that induced him to be so dismissive of everyone and to hold a general disdain for everything that came his way.</t1672> <t1673>It was the desire to appear superior to others.</t1673> <t1674>The motive was too common to cause surprise; but the means, though they might succeed in establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, did not seem adequate to earn him the appreciation of anyone other than his wife.</t1674>
<t1675>—Ah! My dear Miss Dashwood —Mrs. Palmer said to her shortly after—, I have such a great favor to ask of you and your sister.</t1675> <t1676>Would you go to Cleveland to spend some time this Christmas?</t1676> <t1677>Please, accept, and come while the Westons are with us.</t1677> <t1678>You can't imagine how happy you will make me!</t1678> <t1679>My love —she said, addressing her husband—, wouldn't you love to receive the Misses Dashwood at Cleveland?</t1679>
<t1680>—Of course —he responded with a disdainful tone—, it was my sole purpose in coming to Devonshire.</t1680>
<t1681>—There you have it —said his wife—, you see that Mr. Palmer is expecting you; so you cannot refuse.</t1681>
<t1682>Both Elinor and Marianne declined the invitation clearly and decisively.</t1682>
<t1683>—But no, they must go and they will go.</t1683> <t1684>I am sure they will like it above all things.</t1684> <t1685>The Westons will be with us, and it will be extremely pleasant.</t1685> <t1686>You cannot imagine the delightful place that Cleveland is; and we are having such a good time now because Mr. Palmer is traveling around the region all the time for the election campaign; and many people come to dine with us whom I have never seen before, which is absolutely charming.</t1686> <t1687>But, poor him!, it is very tiring for him, because he has to be pleasant to everyone.</t1687>
<t1688>Elinor could barely keep a straight face as she agreed on the difficulty of such an undertaking.</t1688>
<t1689>—What a delight it will be —said Charlotte— when he is in Parliament! Right? How I will laugh!</t1689> <t1690>It will be so funny to see his letters addressed with the initials M. P. 4 But, you know, he says he will never send my letters with the franking privilege he will have as a parliamentarian.</t1690> <t1691>He has said he won't do it, isn't that right, Mr. Palmer?</t1691>
<t1692>Mr. Palmer completely ignored her.</t1692>
<t1693>—He can't stand writing —he continued—, he says it's awful.</t1693>
<t1694>—No —he said—, I have never said anything so irrational.</t1694> <t1695>Don't make me bear all the grievances you inflict on language.</t1695>
<t1696>—Look at him, see how funny he is.</t1696> <t1697>He's always like this!</t1697> <t1698>Sometimes he spends half the day without talking to me, and then he comes out with something so funny... and for any random reason.</t1698>
<t1699>Upon returning to the room, Mrs. Palmer surprised Elinor by asking if she didn't like her husband enormously.</t1699>
<t1700>—Of course —replied Elinor—, he seems like a very pleasant person.</t1700>
<t1701>—Well... I'm so glad that it is so.</t1701> <t1702>I imagined you would like it, as it is so pleasant; I can assure you that Mr. Palmer likes you and your sisters enormously, and you can't imagine how disappointed he will be if you don't come to Cleveland.</t1702> <t1703>I can't imagine why you refuse to do so.</t1703>
<t1704>Once again Elinor was obliged to decline the invitation; and by changing the subject, she put an end to their pleas.</t1704> <t1705>She was thinking about the likelihood that, by living in the same region, Mrs. Palmer could give them more detailed references about Willoughby than those that could be deduced from the limited knowledge the Middletons had of him, and she was eager to obtain from anyone a confirmation of the young man's merits that would eliminate any possibility of fear for Marianne.</t1705> <t1706>She began by asking her if she saw Mr. Willoughby often in Cleveland and if they were closely acquainted with him.</t1706>
<t1707>—Ah! Yes, dear; I know him extremely well —replied Mrs. Palmer—.</t1707> <t1708>Not that I have ever spoken to him, certainly not; but I always see him in the city.</t1708> <t1709>For one reason or another, it has never happened that I was staying in Barton at the same time he was in Allenham.</t1709> <t1710>Mother saw him here once before; but I was with my uncle in Weymouth.</t1710> <t1711>However, I can say that I would have met him countless times in Somersetshire, if unfortunately it hadn't happened that we were never there at the same time.</t1711> <t1712>He spends very little time in Combe, I believe; but if he ever did, I don't think Mr. Palmer would visit him, because, as you know, Mr. Willoughby is in the Opposition, and besides, it's so far away.</t1712> <t1713>I know very well why you ask: your sister is going to marry him.</t1713> <t1714>I'm terribly happy about it, because then, you know, I'll have her as a neighbor.</t1714>
<t1715>—I give you my word —said Elinor— that you know much more than I do about this matter, if you have any reason to expect such a union.</t1715>
<t1716>—Don't try to deny it, because you know that everyone is talking about it.</t1716> <t1717>I assure you that I heard it when I was passing through the city.</t1717>
<t1718>—My dear Mrs. Palmer!</t1718>
<t1719>—Upon my honor, I did it...</t1719> <t1720>On Monday morning, I met Colonel Brandon on Bond Street, just before we left the city, and he told me personally.</t1720>
<t1721>—You surprise me greatly.</t1721> <t1722>That Colonel Brandon told you!</t1722> <t1723>You are surely mistaken.</t1723> <t1724>To give such information to a person who could not be interested, even if it were true, is not what I would expect from Colonel Brandon.</t1724>
<t1725>—But I assure you it happened just as I told you, and I will tell you how it was.</t1725> <t1726>When we met him, he turned back and walked a stretch with us; and we began to talk about my brother-in-law and my sister, and about one thing and another, and I said to him: "So, Colonel, I have heard that there is a new family in the Barton cottage, and my mother has told me that they are very pretty and that one of them is going to marry Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna.</t1726> <t1727>Tell me, is it true? Because of course you must know, as you have been in Devonshire so recently."</t1727>
<t1728>—And what did the colonel say?</t1728>
<t1729>—Oh, he didn't say much; but he seemed to know it was true, so from that moment I took it as a certainty.</t1729> <t1730>It will be marvelous, I tell you! When will it take place?</t1730>
<t1731>Was Mr. Brandon well, I hope?</t1731>
<t1732>—Ah, yes, very well; and full of praise for you; all he did was say good things about you.</t1732>
<t1733>—I am flattered by your praises.</t1733> <t1734>He seems to be an excellent man; and I find him extraordinarily pleasant.</t1734>
<t1735>—Me too...</t1735> <t1736>He is such a charming man, it's a shame that he is so serious and apathetic.</t1736> <t1737>Mom says that he was also in love with her sister.</t1737> <t1738>I assure you it would be a great compliment if he were, because he almost never falls in love with anyone.</t1738>
<t1739>Is Mr. Willoughby very well known in his part of Somersetshire? —said Elinor.</t1739>
<t1740>—Oh, yes, very much!</t1740> <t1741>I mean, I don't think many people visit it, because Combe Magna is so far away; but I assure you that everyone finds it extremely pleasant.</t1741> <t1742>No one is more appreciated than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and you can tell your sister that.</t1742> <t1743>What monstrous good luck she has had in winning him, word of honor; and it's not that his luck isn't greater, because your sister is so good-looking and charming that nothing can be good enough for her.</t1743> <t1744>However, I don't think she is prettier than you at all, I assure you; I think both of you are extremely beautiful, and I'm sure Mr. Palmer thinks the same, although we couldn't get him to admit it last night.</t1744>
<t1745>Mrs. Palmer's information about Willoughby was not very substantial; but any testimony in his favor, however small, was pleasing to Elinor.</t1745>
<t1746>—I am so happy that we have finally met —continued Charlotte—.</t1746> <t1747>And now I hope that we will always be good friends.</t1747> <t1748>You cannot imagine how much I wanted to meet you!</t1748> <t1749>It is so wonderful that you live in the cottage!</t1749> <t1750>Nothing can compare to it, I assure you!</t1750> <t1751>And I am so glad that your sister is going to marry well!</t1751> <t1752>I hope you spend a lot of time at Combe Magna.</t1752> <t1753>It is a delightful place, from every point of view.</t1753>
<t1754>—They have known Colonel Brandon for a long time, haven't they?</t1754>
<t1755>—Yes, a lot; since my sister got married.</t1755> <t1756>He was a friend of Sir John.</t1756> <t1757>I believe —she added in a low voice— that he would have quite liked to have me as his wife, if he could have.</t1757> <t1758>Sir John and Lady Middleton also desired it.</t1758> <t1759>But mother did not think that union was good enough for me; if it had been otherwise, Sir John would have spoken to the colonel and we would have married immediately.</t1759>
<t1760>—Did Colonel Brandon not know about Sir John's proposition to your mother before he made it?</t1760> <t1761>Had he ever expressed his affection to you?</t1761>
<t1762>—Oh, no!</t1762> <t1763>But if mom hadn't opposed it, I would say that nothing would have pleased him more.</t1763>
<t1764>At that time, he had not seen me more than twice, because it was before I left school.</t1764> <t1765>But I am much happier as I am.</t1765> <t1766>Mr. Palmer is exactly the kind of man I like.</t1766>
<t1767>CHAPTER XXI</t1767>
<t1768>The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and only the two families remained in Barton to invite each other over.</t1768> <t1769>But this did not last long; Elinor was still trying to wrap her head around their last visitors —she couldn't stop marveling at how Charlotte was so happy for no apparent reason; at Mr. Palmer acting so simple-mindedly, despite being a capable man; and at the strange discord that often existed between husband and wife—, before the active zeal of Sir John and Mrs. Jennings in favor of social life offered her a new group of their acquaintances to see and observe.</t1769>
<t1770>During a morning walk to Exeter, they had encountered two young ladies whom Mrs. Jennings had the joy of recognizing as relatives, and this was enough for Sir John to immediately invite them to Barton Park as soon as they had fulfilled their current commitments in Exeter.</t1770> <t1771>Their commitments in Exeter were immediately canceled upon such an invitation, and when Sir John returned to the house, he induced a not insignificant alarm in Lady Middleton by telling her that she would soon be receiving the visit of two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance... even of their acceptable manners, she had no proof; because the guarantees that her husband and her mother could offer her in this regard were of no use to her.</t1771> <t1772>The fact that they were relatives made things worse; and Mrs. Jennings' attempts to console her daughter with the argument that she should not worry about whether they were distinguished, because they were cousins and should tolerate each other, were not very successful at that time.</t1772>
<t1773>Since it was already impossible to avoid their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of the visit with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, who simply contented herself with a kind reprimand to her husband five or six times a day on the same subject.</t1773>
<t1774>The young ladies arrived, and their appearance turned out to be not at all undistinguished or without style.</t1774> <t1775>Their attire was very elegant, their manners courteous, they were delighted with the house and ecstatic about the furniture, and as it happened that they were enchanted with the children, within an hour of their arrival at the estate they had already won Lady Middleton's approval.</t1775> <t1776>She declared that they were indeed very pleasant girls, which for her ladyship implied enthusiastic admiration.</t1776> <t1777>With such lively praise, Sir John's confidence in his own judgment grew, and he immediately set off to inform the Miss Dashwoods about the arrival of the Miss Steeles and assure them that they were the sweetest girls in the world.</t1777> <t1778>From recommendations of this kind, however, not much could be deduced; Elinor knew that the sweetest girls in the world could be found everywhere in England, in all different aspects, faces, temperaments, and intelligences possible.</t1778> <t1779>Sir John wanted the whole family to immediately head to the estate and take a look at his guests.</t1779> <t1780>What a benevolent and philanthropic man!</t1780> <t1781>Even a third cousin was hard for him to keep just for himself.</t1781>
<t1782>—Come now —he was saying to them—, I beg you; you must come... I will not accept a refusal: you will come.</t1782> <t1783>You can't imagine how much you will like them.</t1783> <t1784>Lucy is terribly pretty, and so cheerful and good-natured!</t1784> <t1785>The children are already attached to her as if she were an old acquaintance.</t1785> <t1786>And both of them are dying to see you, because in Exeter they heard that you were the most beautiful creatures in the world; I told them it was absolutely true, and much more.</t1786> <t1787>I'm sure you will love them.</t1787> <t1788>They have brought a carriage full of toys for the children.</t1788> <t1789>How can you be so elusive and think of not coming!</t1789> <t1790>They are somehow your cousins, aren't they?</t1790> <t1791>Because you are my cousins and they are my wife's, so you must be related.</t1791>
<t1792>But Sir John did not achieve his goal.</t1792> <t1793>He could only extract from them the promise to go to the estate within one or two days, and then he left, astonished at their indifference, to head home and boast once again about the qualities of the Dashwoods to the Misses Steele, just as he had boasted about the Misses Steele to the Dashwoods.</t1793>
<t1794>When they fulfilled the promised visit to the estate and were introduced to the young ladies, they found nothing to admire in the appearance of the elder, who was nearly thirty and had an unattractive and dull face; but in the other, who was no more than twenty-two or twenty-three years old, they found ample beauty; her features were pretty, she had a sharp and keen look, and a certain gracefulness in her appearance that, although it did not give her true elegance, did make her stand out.</t1794> <t1795>The manners of both were especially courteous, and soon Elinor had to acknowledge some good judgment in them, seeing the constant and timely attentions with which they endeared themselves to Lady Middleton.</t1795> <t1796>With the children, they showed continuous rapture, praising their beauty, attracting their attention, and indulging their every whim; and the little time they could spare from the untimely demands to which their gentleness exposed them, they dedicated to admiring whatever her ladyship was doing, if she was doing anything, or to copying the model of some new elegant dress that, having seen her wear the day before, had sent them into endless ecstasy.</t1796> <t1797>Fortunately for those who seek to flatter by touching on such weak points, a loving mother, although the most voracious of human beings when it comes to hunting for praises for her children, is also the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant, but she swallows anything; and thus, Lady Middleton accepted without the slightest surprise or distrust the exaggerated displays of affection and the patience of the Misses Steele towards her children.</t1797> <t1798>She viewed with maternal complacency all the mischief and impertinent pranks to which her cousins subjected themselves.</t1798> <t1799>She observed how they untied their belts, pulled their hair that hung loose around their ears, rummaged through their sewing kits and took out their penknives and scissors, and had no doubt that the pleasure was mutual.</t1799> <t1800>It seemed to indicate that the only thing that surprised her was that Elinor and Marianne were sitting there, so composed, without asking to be allowed to join in what was happening.</t1800>
<t1801>—John is so excited today! —she said, seeing how he took Miss Steele's handkerchief and threw it out the window—.</t1801> <t1802>He doesn't stop causing mischief.</t1802>
<t1803>And shortly after, when her second child violently pinched the same young lady on the finger, she commented lovingly:</t1803>
<t1804>—How playful William is!</t1804> <t1805>And here is my sweet Annamaria —he added, tenderly caressing a little girl of three who had remained silent for the last two minutes—.</t1805> <t1806>She is always so gentle and calm; there has never been a little girl so calm!</t1806>
<t1807>But unfortunately, when she was filled with hugs, a pin from her ladyship's headdress slightly scratched the girl on the neck, causing in this model of gentleness such violent screams that they could hardly have been surpassed by any creature known for being noisy.</t1807><t1808>The consternation of her mother was enormous, but it could not surpass the alarm of the Misses Steele, and among the three of them, they did everything that affection indicated should be done in such a critical emergency to mitigate the agonies of the little sufferer.</t1808><t1809>They sat her on her mother's lap, covered her with kisses; one of the Misses Steele, kneeling to attend to her, dabbed her wound with lavender water, and the other filled her mouth with candied plums.</t1809><t1810>With such rewards for her tears, the girl had the wisdom not to stop crying.</t1810><t1811>She continued to scream and sob vigorously, kicked her two brothers when they tried to touch her, and nothing they did to calm her had the slightest effect, until fortunately Lady Middleton remembered that in a similar scene of distress the previous week, they had applied a bit of apricot jam to a bruised temple; she insistently proposed the same remedy for this unfortunate scratch, and the slight pause in the young girl's screams upon hearing it gave them reason to hope it would not be rejected.</t1811><t1812>She then left the room in her mother's arms in search of this medicine, and as the two boys wanted to follow them, although their mother earnestly begged them to stay, the four young women found themselves alone in a quiet that the room had not known for many hours.</t1812>
<t1813>—Poor little creature! —said Miss Steele as soon as they left—.</t1813> <t1814>It could have been a very sad accident.</t1814>
<t1815>—Although I can hardly imagine it —exclaimed Marianne—, unless it had happened under very different circumstances.</t1815> <t1816>But this is the usual way to increase alarm when there is actually nothing to be alarmed about.</t1816>
<t1817>—What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is —said Lucy Steele.</t1817>
<t1818>Marianne remained silent.</t1818> <t1819>It was impossible for her to say something she didn't feel, no matter how trivial the occasion; and in this way, the entire task of telling lies when courtesy required it always fell upon Elinor.</t1819> <t1820>She did her best, when duty called her to it, to speak of Lady Middleton with more enthusiasm than she felt, although it was much less than that of Miss Lucy.</t1820>
<t1821>—And sir John too —exclaimed the older sister—.</t1821> <t1822>What a charming man!</t1822>
<t1823>Also in this case, as the good opinion that Miss Dashwood had of him was nothing more than simple and fair, it was presented without great exaggerations.</t1823> <t1824>She only observed that he was very good-natured and friendly.</t1824>
<t1825>—And what a charming family you have!</t1825> <t1826>In my entire life, I had never seen such magnificent children.</t1826> <t1827>Believe me, I already adore them, and I truly am crazy about children.</t1827>
<t1828>—I would have imagined it —said Elinor with a smile—, from what I saw this morning.</t1828>
<t1829>—I have the idea —said Lucy— that you think the little Middletons are too spoiled; they might be on the verge of being so, but it is so natural for Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children full of life and energy; I can't stand them if they are docile and quiet.</t1829>
<t1830>—I confess —replied Elinor—, that when I am at Barton Park, I never think with horror of docile and quiet children.</t1830>
<t1831>After these words, there was a brief pause, first broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very inclined to conversation and now said, somewhat abruptly:</t1831>
<t1832>—And, do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood?</t1832> <t1833>I suppose you regretted leaving Sussex very much.</t1833>
<t1834>Somewhat surprised by the familiarity of this question, or at least by the way it was asked, Elinor replied that yes, it had been difficult for her.</t1834>
<t1835>—Norland is an incredibly beautiful place, isn't it? —added Miss Steele.</t1835>
<t1836>—We have heard that Sir John has an enormous admiration for him —said Lucy, who seemed to believe that some excuse was needed for the freedom with which her sister had spoken.</t1836>
<t1837>—I believe that everyone who has been there must admire it —replied Elinor—, although it is to be supposed that no one appreciates its beauties as much as we do.</t1837>
<t1838>—And did you have many distinguished admirers there?</t1838> <t1839>I imagine that in this part of the world you don't have as many; as for me, I think they are always a great asset.</t1839>
<t1840>—But why —said Lucy, with an air of feeling embarrassed by her sister— do you think that in Devonshire there aren't as many handsome young men as in Sussex?</t1840>
<t1841>—No, dear, of course it is not my intention to say that there are none.</t1841> <t1842>I am sure there are a great number of very distinguished gentlemen in Exeter; but how do you think I could know if there are pleasant young men in Norland?</t1842> <t1843>And I only feared that the Miss Dashwoods might find Barton boring if they do not find as many here as they were accustomed to having.</t1843> <t1844>But perhaps you young ladies do not care about suitors, and are as comfortable without them as with them.</t1844> <t1845>For my part, I think they are enormously pleasant, as long as they dress elegantly and behave with civility.</t1845> <t1846>But I cannot stand to see them when they are dirty or disagreeable.</t1846> <t1847>Take, for example, Mr. Rose from Exeter, a marvelously elegant young man, quite handsome, who works for Mr. Simpson, as you know; and yet, if one meets him in the morning, one cannot even look at him.</t1847> <t1848>I imagine, Miss Dashwood, that your brother was a great gentleman before he married, considering that he was so rich, wasn't he?</t1848>
<t1849>—I promise you —replied Elinor— that I couldn't tell you, because I don't quite understand the meaning of the word.</t1849> <t1850>But this I can tell you: if he was ever a gallant before getting married, he still is, because there hasn't been the slightest change in him.</t1850>
<t1851>—Oh, dear!</t1851> <t1852>One never thinks of married men as suitors...</t1852> <t1853>They have other things to do.</t1853>
<t1854>—For God's sake, Anne! —exclaimed her sister—.</t1854> <t1855>You only talk about suitors.</t1855> <t1856>You will make Miss Dashwood believe that you think of nothing else.</t1856>
<t1857>Then, to change the subject, he began to express his admiration for the house and the furniture.</t1857>
<t1858>This sample of what the Steele sisters were like was enough.</t1858> <t1859>The vulgar liberties taken by the elder and her foolishness left her with nothing in her favor, and since neither the beauty nor the shrewd appearance of the younger had made Elinor lose sight of her lack of real elegance and naturalness, she left the house with no desire to know them further.</t1859>
<t1860>The same did not happen with the Misses Steele.</t1860> <t1861>They came from Exeter, well provided with admiration for Sir John, his family, and all his relatives, and they did not stingily withhold any part of it from the beautiful cousins of the host, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, complete, and perfect young ladies they had ever seen, and whom they were particularly eager to know better.</t1861> <t1862>And consequently, Elinor soon discovered that getting to know them better was her inevitable fate; as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Misses Steele, his side was going to be too strong to present any opposition, and they were going to have to submit to that kind of intimacy which consists of sitting all together in the same room for one or two hours almost daily.</t1862> <t1863>Sir John could do no more, but he did not know that more was needed; in his opinion, being together was enjoying intimacy, and as long as his continuous plans for everyone to gather were effective, he had no doubt that they were true friends.</t1863>
<t1864>To do her justice, she did everything in her power to foster an unreserved relationship between them, and to that end, she disclosed to the Misses Steele everything she knew or supposed regarding her cousins' situation in the most delicate aspects; and thus, Elinor had not seen them more than a couple of times before the elder of them congratulated her on her sister's fortune in having won over a very distinguished suitor upon her arrival at Barton.</t1864>
<t1865>—Surely it will be a great thing to have married her off so young —he said—, and I have been told that he is a great gallant, and marvelously handsome.</t1865> <t1866>And I hope that you too will soon have the same good fortune... although perhaps you already have someone ready out there.</t1866>
<t1867>Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more discreet in proclaiming his suspicions about her affection for Edward than he had been regarding Marianne; in fact, between the two situations, hers was the one he preferred for his jests, due to its greater novelty and because it provided more fodder for conjectures: since Edward's visit, they had never dined together without him toasting to the health of her loved ones, with a voice so laden with meanings, so many nods and winks, that it could not help but alert everyone.</t1867> <t1868>Invariably, the letter F was brought up, and with it, so many countless jokes had been made that Elinor had long since recognized it as the most ingenious letter of the alphabet.</t1868>
<t1869>The Misses Steele, as I had imagined would happen, were the recipients of all these jokes, and in the elder one, they aroused a great curiosity to know the name of the gentleman to whom they alluded, a curiosity that, although often expressed with impertinence, was perfectly consistent with their constant inquiries into the affairs of the Dashwood family.</t1869> <t1870>But Sir John did not play too long with the interest he had enjoyed arousing, because saying the name was as pleasurable to him as hearing it was to Miss Steele.</t1870>
<t1871>—His name is Ferrars —she said, in a very audible whisper—, but I beg you not to say it, because it is a great secret.</t1871>
<t1872>—Ferrars! —repeated Miss Steele—.</t1872> <t1873>Mr. Ferrars is the lucky gentleman, isn't he? My goodness!</t1873> <t1874>The brother of your sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood?</t1874> <t1875>A very pleasant young man, certainly.</t1875> <t1876>I know him very well.</t1876>
<t1877>—How can you say such a thing, Anne? —exclaimed Lucy, who generally corrected all her sister's statements—.</t1877> <t1878>Although we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's house, it is excessive to claim to know him well.</t1878>
<t1879>Elinor listened with attention and surprise to all that had been said.</t1879> <t1880>“And who was this uncle?</t1880> <t1881>Where did he live? How did they meet?”</t1881> <t1882>She had a great desire for them to continue with the topic, although she preferred not to join the conversation; but nothing more was said about it and, for the first time in her life, she thought that Mrs. Jennings either lacked curiosity after such meager information, or the desire to show her interest.</t1882> <t1883>The way Miss Steele had spoken of Edward increased her curiosity, because she felt that she did so with some malice and planted the suspicion that she knew, or imagined she knew, something to the young man's discredit.</t1883> <t1884>But her curiosity was in vain, because Miss Steele paid no more attention to Mr. Ferrars' name when Sir John alluded to him or mentioned him openly.</t1884>
<t1885>CHAPTER XXII</t1885>
<t1886>Marianne, who had never been too tolerant of things like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of character, or even differences in taste from her own, was on this occasion particularly reluctant, given her state of mind, to find the Misses Steele agreeable or to encourage their advances; and to this invariable coldness in her behavior, which frustrated all attempts they made to establish a relationship of intimacy, Elinor attributed in the first place the preference for her that became evident in the treatment of both sisters, especially Lucy, who never missed an opportunity to engage in conversation or to attempt a closer relationship through an easy and open communication of her feelings.</t1886>
<t1887>Lucy was naturally clever; her observations were often just and entertaining, and as company for half an hour, Elinor often found her pleasant.</t1887> <t1888>But her innate abilities had in no way been complemented by education; she was ignorant and uncultured, and the insufficiency of any intellectual refinement in her, her lack of information on the most common matters, could not go unnoticed by Miss Dashwood, despite all the young woman's efforts to appear superior.</t1888> <t1889>Elinor perceived the neglect of abilities that education would have made so respectable, and she pitied her for it; but she viewed with much less tender feelings the total lack of delicacy, rectitude, and integrity of spirit that betrayed her laborious and constant attentions and flattery to the Middletons; and she could not find lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who combined ignorance with insincerity, whose lack of education prevented a conversation between them on equal terms, and whose conduct towards others stripped any value from any show of attention or deference towards her.</t1889>
<t1890>—I fear my question might seem strange to you —Lucy said to her one day while they were walking together from the estate to the cottage—, but, if you don't mind, do you personally know your sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?</t1890>
<t1891>To Elinor, the question did indeed seem quite strange, and this was revealed by her expression as she responded that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.</t1891>
<t1892>Wow! —replied Lucy—.</t1892> <t1893>How curious, I thought I must have seen her sometime in Norland.</t1893> <t1894>Then maybe you can't tell me what kind of woman she is.</t1894>
<t1895>—No —replied Elinor, careful not to give her true opinion of Edward's mother, and with little desire to satisfy what seemed like impertinent curiosity—, I know nothing of her.</t1895>
<t1896>—Surely you will think I am very strange, for asking about her like this —said Lucy, watching Elinor closely as she spoke—; but perhaps there are reasons...</t1896> <t1897>I wish I dared; but, even so, I trust you will do me the justice of believing that it is not my intention to be impertinent.</t1897>
<t1898>Elinor gave a polite response, and they walked in silence for a few minutes.</t1898> <t1899>It was broken by Lucy, who resumed the topic, saying somewhat hesitantly:</t1899>
<t1900>—I cannot stand being thought impertinently curious; I would give anything in the world rather than appear so to a person like you, whose opinion is so valuable to me.</t1900> <t1901>And certainly, I would have no fear of confiding in you; I would truly appreciate your advice in a situation as uncomfortable as this one in which I find myself; however, it is not a matter of troubling you.</t1901> <t1902>I regret that you do not know Mrs. Ferrars.</t1902>
<t1903>—I would also regret it —said Elinor, astonished—, if it had been of any use to you to know my opinion about her.</t1903> <t1904>But, truly, I never thought you had any connection with that family and, therefore, I confess that I am somewhat surprised that you inquire so much about Mrs. Ferrars' character.</t1904>
<t1905>—I suppose it does surprise you, and I must say that I am not astonished that it does.</t1905> <t1906>But if I dared to explain, you would not be so surprised.</t1906> <t1907>Mrs. Ferrars is actually nothing to me at present..., but the time may come..., how soon it comes, necessarily depends on her..., when our relationship will be very close.</t1907>
<t1908>She lowered her eyes as she said this, sweetly demure, with only a sidelong glance at her companion to observe the effect it had on her.</t1908>
<t1909>—Good heavens! —exclaimed Elinor—, what do you mean?</t1909> <t1910>Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars? Do you know him? —and she was not too pleased with the idea of such a sister-in-law.</t1910>
<t1911>—No —replied Lucy—, not Mr. Robert Fernars..., I have never seen him in my life; but yes —she added, fixing her gaze on Elinor— his older brother.</t1911>
<t1912>What did Elinor feel at that moment?</t1912> <t1913>Stupor, which would have been as painful as it was sharp, if it had not been accompanied by an immediate doubt regarding the statement that caused it.</t1913> <t1914>She turned to Lucy in silent astonishment, unable to guess the motive or purpose of such a claim; and although the color of her face changed, she remained firm in disbelief, out of any danger of a hysterical attack or a fainting spell.</t1914>
<t1915>—It is natural that you feel surprised —continued Lucy—, for you certainly could not have known it before; I would bet that he never gave you the slightest hint of it, neither to you nor to your family, as it was supposed to be a great secret, and I can assure you that not a single word has come from me until this moment.</t1915> <t1916>Not a single one.</t1916> <t1917>person in my family knows, except for Anne, and I would never have mentioned it to you if I did not have the utmost confidence in your discretion; I thought that my behavior in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must have seemed so out of place that it warranted an explanation.</t1917> <t1918>And I do not think Mr. Ferrars will be so upset when he knows that I have confided in you, because I know for a fact that he has the highest opinion of your entire family, and considers you and the other Miss Dashwood as if you were true sisters —she paused.</t1918>
<t1919>Elinor remained silent for a few moments.</t1919> <t1920>Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great to be expressed in words; but after a while, forcing herself to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said in a calm manner that almost successfully concealed her surprise and anxiety:</t1920>
<t1921>May I ask if your commitment is long-standing?</t1921>
<t1922>—We have been engaged for four years.</t1922>
<t1923>—Four years!</t1923>
<t1924>—Yes.</t1924>
<t1925>Although such words shook her deeply, Elinor still could not believe them.</t1925>
<t1926>—Until the other day —he said— I didn't even know they knew each other.</t1926>
<t1927>—However, we have known each other for many years.</t1927> <t1928>He was under my uncle's tutelage, you know, for quite some time.</t1928>
<t1929>—Your uncle!</t1929>
<t1930>—Yes, Mr. Pratt.</t1930> <t1931>Have you never heard him mention Mr. Pratt?</t1931>
<t1932>—I believe so —replied Elinor, making an effort whose intensity increased in parallel with the intensity of her emotion.</t1932>
<t1933>—He was with my uncle for four years, who lives in Longstaple, near Plymouth.</t1933> <t1934>It was there that we met, because my sister and I often stayed with my uncle, and it was there that we got engaged, although not until a year after he had ceased to be a pupil; but after that, he was almost always with us.</t1934> <t1935>As you can imagine, I was quite reluctant to start such a relationship without the knowledge and approval of his mother; but I was also too young and loved him too much to have acted with the prudence that.</t1935> <t1936>I should have had...</t1936> <t1937>Although you do not know him as well as I do, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen him enough to realize that he is very capable of inspiring a very sincere affection in a woman.</t1937>
<t1938>—By the way —Elinor replied, not knowing what she was saying; but after a moment of reflection, she added with renewed confidence in Edward's honor and love, and in the falseness of her companion—: Engaged to Mr. Ferrars!</t1938> <t1939>I confess I am so absolutely surprised by what you say, that truly... I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake regarding the person or the name.</t1939> <t1940>We cannot be talking about the same Mr. Ferrars.</t1940>
<t1941>—We cannot be talking about anyone else —exclaimed Lucy, smiling—.</t1941> <t1942>Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars of Park Street, and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I am referring to; you must grant me that it is quite unlikely that I would be mistaken about the name of the man on whom all my happiness depends.</t1942>
<t1943>—It's strange —replied Elinor, immersed in a painful perplexity— that I have never even heard him mention her name.</t1943>
<t1944>—No; considering our situation, it is not strange.</t1944> <t1945>Our main concern has been to keep this matter a secret...</t1945> <t1946>You knew nothing about me or my family, and therefore there was never an opportunity to mention my name to you; and since he was always so fearful that his sister might suspect something, he had sufficient reason not to mention it.</t1946>
<t1947>She remained silent.</t1947> <t1948>Elinor's confidence wavered, but her self-control did not falter.</t1948>
<t1949>—They have been engaged for four years —he said firmly.</t1949>
<t1950>—Yes; and God knows how much longer we will have to wait.</t1950> <t1951>Poor Edward!</t1951> <t1952>He feels quite disheartened —and taking a small miniature out of his pocket, he adds: To avoid the possibility of error, please look at this face.</t1952> <t1953>It certainly doesn't do him justice, but even so, I think you can't mistake the person depicted there.</t1953> <t1954>I've carried it with me for these three years.</t1954>
<t1955>While saying the above, she placed the miniature in Elinor's hands; and when she saw the painting, if she had been able to cling to any other doubts for fear of a too hasty decision or her desire to detect a falsehood, now she could have none regarding whether it was Edward's face.</t1955> <t1956>She returned the miniature almost immediately, acknowledging the resemblance.</t1956>
<t1957>—I have never been able —continued Lucy— to give him my portrait in return, which annoys me greatly; he has always wanted so much to have it!</t1957> <t1958>But I am determined to have it done at the first opportunity I get.</t1958>
<t1959>—You are absolutely right —Elinor responded calmly.</t1959> <t1960>They walked a few steps in silence.</t1960> <t1961>Lucy spoke first.</t1961>
<t1962>—I am sure —she said—, I have no doubt at all, that he will faithfully keep that secret, because he will imagine how important it is for us that it does not reach his mother's ears, for, I must say, she would never approve of it.</t1962> <t1963>I will not receive any fortune, and I believe I know that she is a remarkably proud woman.</t1963>
<t1964>—At no point have I sought to be your confidant —he said.</t1964> <t1965>Elinor—, but you do me justice in imagining that I am trustworthy.</t1965> <t1966>Your secret is safe with me; but excuse me if I express some surprise at such an unnecessary revelation.</t1966> <t1967>At the very least, you must have felt that telling me this secret did not make it any more protected.</t1967>
<t1968>While saying this, he looked at Lucy intently, hoping to discover something in her expression... perhaps the falsehood of most of what she had been saying; but Lucy's face remained unchanged.</t1968>
<t1969>—I was afraid I had made you think that I was taking great liberties with you —he said— by telling you all this.</t1969> <t1970>It is true that I have not known you for long, at least personally, but for quite some time I have known about you and your entire family by hearsay; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if you were an old acquaintance.</t1970> <t1971>Besides, in the current case, I really thought I owed you some explanation after having questioned you so thoroughly about Edward's mother; and unfortunately, I have no one to ask for advice.</t1971> <t1972>Anne is the only person who is aware of it, and she has no judgment at all; in fact, she does me much more harm than good, because I live in constant fear that she will betray my secret.</t1972> <t1973>She doesn't know how to keep her mouth shut, as you may have realized.</t1973> <t1974>and I don't think I have ever been as terrified as the other day, when Sir John mentioned Edward's name, that she would tell everything.</t1974> <t1975>You can't imagine the things I go through with all this.</t1975> <t1976>I am already surprised to still be alive after what I have suffered because of Edward these past four years.</t1976> <t1977>So much suspense and uncertainty, and seeing him so little... we can hardly meet more than twice a year.</t1977> <t1978>I don't know how my heart isn't shattered.</t1978>
<t1979>At that moment, he took out his handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel too compassionate.</t1979><t1980>,</t1980>
<t1981>—Sometimes —continued Lucy after wiping her eyes—, I wonder if it wouldn't be better for the two of us to end the whole matter completely —as she said this, she looked directly at her companion—.</t1981> <t1982>But, other times, I don't have enough willpower to do it.</t1982> <t1983>I can't bear the idea of making him so unhappy, as I know he would be at the mere mention of something like that.</t1983> <t1984>And also on my part... with how dear he is to me... I don't think I'm capable of it.</t1984> <t1985>What would you advise me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?</t1985> <t1986>What would you do?</t1986>
<t1987>—Forgive me —replied Elinor, startled by the question—, but I cannot give you any advice under such circumstances.</t1987> <t1988>It is your own judgment that must guide you.</t1988>
<t1989>—Surely —continued Lucy after a few minutes of silence from both sides—, sooner or later his mother will have to provide him with means of living; but poor Edward feels so down about all this!</t1989> <t1990>Didn't he seem terribly discouraged when he was in Barton?</t1990> <t1991>He felt so miserable when he left Longstaple to go to you, that I feared you would think he was very ill.</t1991>
<t1992>—Were you coming from your uncle's place when you visited us?</t1992>
<t1993>—Oh, yes!</t1993> <t1994>He had been with us for fifteen days.</t1994> <t1995>Did you think he was coming directly from the city?</t1995>
<t1996>—No —replied Elinor, painfully sensitive to each new circumstance that supported the truthfulness of Lucy—.</t1996> <t1997>I remember she told us she had spent fifteen days with some friends near Plymouth.</t1997>
<t1998>He also remembered his own surprise back then, when he didn't add anything more about those friends and kept total silence even regarding their names.</t1998>
<t1999>Didn't they think I was terribly discouraged? —repeated Lucy.</t1999>
<t2000>—Actually, yes, especially when he just arrived.</t2000>
<t2001>—I begged him to make an effort, fearing that you would suspect what was happening; but it saddened him so much not to be able to spend more than fifteen days with us, and seeing me so affected...</t2001> <t2002>Poor man!</t2002> <t2003>I fear the same thing will happen now, as his letters reveal such a miserable state of mind.</t2003> <t2004>I heard from him just before leaving Exeter —she said, taking a letter out of her pocket and showing the address to Elinor without much ceremony—.</t2004> <t2005>You know his handwriting, I imagine; a charming handwriting; but it is not as well done as usual.</t2005> <t2006>He was tired, I imagine, because he had filled the page to the brim writing to me.</t2006>
<t2007>Elinor saw that it was indeed his handwriting, and she could no longer doubt.</t2007> <t2008>The portrait, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been obtained by chance; it might not have been a gift from Edward; but a correspondence between them could only exist given a real commitment; nothing but that could authorize it.</t2008> <t2009>For a few moments, she felt almost defeated... her heart sank and she could barely stand; but it was absolutely necessary to overcome it, and she fought with such determination against the anguish of her spirit that success was swift and, for the moment, complete.</t2009>
<t2010>—Writing to each other —said Lucy, returning the letter to her pocket— is our only comfort during these prolonged separations.</t2010> <t2011>Yes, I have another comfort in his portrait; but poor Edward doesn't even have that.</t2011> <t2012>If he at least had my portrait, he says it would be easier for him.</t2012> <t2013>The last time he was in Longstaple, I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring, and that has given him some comfort, he says, but it's not the same as a portrait.</t2013> <t2014>Did you perhaps notice that ring when you saw him?</t2014>
<t2015>—Yes, I noticed —said Elinor, with a serene voice behind which hid an emotion and distress greater than she had ever felt before.</t2015> <t2016>She felt mortified, disturbed, confused.</t2016>
<t2017>Fortunately for her, they had already reached their tea, and the conversation could not continue.</t2017> <t2018>After staying with them for a few minutes, the Misses Steele returned to the estate, and Elinor was free to think and feel miserable.</t2018>
<t2019>CHAPTER XXIII</t2019>
<t2020>No matter how little confidence Elinor had in Lucy's veracity, it was impossible for her, when thinking seriously, to suspect her under the current circumstances, where hardly anything could induce her to invent lies like the previous ones.</t2020><t2021>In the face of what Lucy claimed to be true, therefore, Elinor could not, would not dare to continue doubting, as it was so absolutely backed by so many probabilities and proofs, and impugned only by her own desires.</t2021><t2022>Having had the opportunity to meet at Mr. Pratt's house was the basis for everything else, a basis both indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit to somewhere near Plymouth, his melancholy, his dissatisfaction with the prospects before him, the intimate knowledge the Misses Steele showed of Norland and its family relations, which had often surprised her; the portrait, the letter, the ring, all together constituted such a solid body of evidence that it nullified any fear of condemning Edward unjustly and confirmed as a fact that no partiality for him could overlook his disregard for her.</t2022><t2023>Her resentment at such conduct, her indignation at having been a victim of it, for a brief moment made her focus only on her own feelings; but soon other thoughts, other considerations broke through.</t2023><t2024>Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her?</t2024><t2025>Had he feigned an affection for her that he did not feel?</t2025><t2026>Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart?</t2026><t2027>No; no matter what it might once have been, she could not believe such a thing now.</t2027><t2028>Edward's affection belonged to her.</t2028><t2029>She could not deceive herself in that.</t2029><t2030>Her mother, her sisters, Fanny, all had noticed the interest he had shown in her at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity.</t2030><t2031>Surely, he loved her.</t2031><t2032>How this conviction soothed her heart!</t2032><t2033>How many more things it tempted her to forgive!</t2033><t2034>He had been guilty, enormously guilty of staying at Norland after he first felt that her influence over him was greater than it should be.</t2034><t2035>In that, he could not be defended; but if he had hurt her, how much more had he hurt himself!</t2035><t2036>If her case was worthy of compassion, his was hopeless.</t2036><t2037>If for a time his imprudence had made her unhappy, it seemed to have deprived him of any possibility of being otherwise.</t2037><t2038>In the long run, she might regain her tranquility; but he, what could he place his hopes in?</t2038><t2039>Could he ever achieve a passable happiness with Lucy Steele?</t2039><t2040>If affection for her was impossible, could he, with his integrity, his delicacy, and cultivated intelligence, feel satisfied with such a wife: uneducated, cunning, and selfish?</t2040>
<t2041>The infatuation typical of a nineteen-year-old could very well have blinded him to everything except Lucy's beauty and good character; but the following four years — years that, if lived rationally, greatly enrich one's understanding — should have opened his eyes to the deficiencies in his education; and the same period of time, which she spent in the company of people of lower status and engaged in more frivolous interests, might have stripped her of that simplicity that once could have given an interesting touch to her beauty.</t2041>
<t2042>If when it was supposed that it was Elinor he wanted to marry, the obstacles put forth by his mother had seemed great, how much greater must they be now, when the person he was engaged to was undoubtedly inferior to her in connections and, in all probability, inferior in fortune!</t2042> <t2043>Indeed, with Edward's heart so detached from Lucy, perhaps the demands on his patience were not too great; but melancholy can only be the natural state of a person who feels relieved at the expectations of opposition and harshness from the family!</t2043>
<t2044>As these thoughts painfully succeeded one another in her mind, she wept for him more than for herself.</t2044> <t2045>Relying on the conviction that she had done nothing to deserve her current misery, and comforted by the belief that Edward had done nothing to alienate her affection, Elinor thought that even now, in the midst of the sharp pain following the harsh blow she had received, she could control herself enough to hide from her mother and sisters any suspicion of the truth.</t2045> <t2046>And she fulfilled her own expectations so well that when she joined them at dinner just two hours after witnessing the death of her dearest hopes, no one could have suspected, from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was living with a secret grief against the barriers that would forever separate her from the object of her love, and that Marianne was delighting inwardly in the perfections of a man whose heart she felt entirely captive, and whom she hoped to see in every carriage that approached their house.</t2046>
<t2047>The need to hide from her mother and Marianne what had been entrusted to her as a secret, although it required her to make an incessant effort, did not aggravate Elinor's pain.</t2047> <t2048>On the contrary, it was a relief for her to spare herself from having to communicate something that would have distressed them so much, and at the same time free herself from listening to how their excessive and affectionate partiality for her would probably have unleashed in condemnations of Edward, something that was more than she felt capable of bearing.</t2048>
<t2049>Elinor knew that she could not receive any help from the advice or conversation of her family; the tenderness and sorrow they would show would only increase the pain she felt, while her self-control would receive no encouragement from either their example or their praise.</t2049> <t2050>Solitude made her stronger and her own good judgment offered her such good support that her firmness remained unshaken and her appearance of cheerfulness as constant as it could be amidst such sharp and recent sufferings.</t2050>
<t2051>Despite how much she had suffered in her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt a strong desire to resume it, and this for more than one reason.</t2051> <t2052>She wanted to hear again many details of her engagement; she wanted to understand more clearly what Lucy really felt for Edward, if she was truly sincere in her declarations of tender affection for him; and especially she wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to delve into the matter again and her calmness in discussing it, that she was interested only as a friend, something she feared she had at least left in doubt with her involuntary agitation during their morning conversation.</t2052> <t2053>That Lucy was inclined to feel jealous of her seemed quite probable; it was evident that Edward had always praised her a lot, and evident not only by what Lucy said, but by her daring to confide in her, after so little time of knowing each other in person, such a well-known and obviously important secret.</t2053> <t2054>And even the jocular comments of Sir John might have weighed in on it.</t2054> <t2055>But, indeed, as long as Elinor continued to feel so secure within herself that Edward truly loved her, no further calculations of probabilities were needed to consider it natural that Lucy felt jealous; and of her jealousy, her very confidence was sufficient proof.</t2055> <t2056>What other reason could there be to reveal her story, but that Elinor should know of the greater rights that Lucy had over Edward and learn to avoid him in the future?</t2056> <t2057>It did not take much for her to understand up to this point the intentions of her rival, and while she was firmly determined to act as all principles of honor and honesty required to fight against her own affection for Edward and see him as little as possible, she could not deny herself the comfort of trying to convince Lucy that her heart was unscathed.</t2057> <t2058>And as nothing could add more pain on the subject than what had already been heard, she did not doubt her own ability to calmly endure a repetition of the details.</t2058>
<t2059>But the opportunity to carry out the plan took a while to arrive, although Lucy was as well-disposed as she was to take advantage of any occasion that presented itself, for a rather variable climate prevented them from going out for walks, an activity that would have easily allowed them to separate from the others; and although they met at least every other day at the estate or the cabin, especially at the former, it was not supposed that the purpose of meeting was to converse.</t2059> <t2060>Such an idea would never cross the minds of either Sir John or Lady Middleton, and thus they left very little time for a conversation in which everyone participated, and none at all for personal dialogues.</t2060> <t2061>They gathered to eat, drink, and laugh together, to play cards or guessing games or any other entertainment that produced enough uproar.</t2061>
<t2062>One or two of such meetings had already passed without giving Elinor any opportunity to meet with Lucy in private, when one morning Sir John appeared at the house to earnestly beg them to dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he had to attend the club in Exeter and she might be left completely alone, except for her mother and the two Miss Steeles.</t2062> <t2063>Elinor, who foresaw that a good opportunity for the matter she had in mind was being offered in a gathering like this, where they would be more at ease under the calm and well-mannered direction of Lady Middleton than on the occasions when her husband brought them together for his noisy gatherings, immediately accepted the invitation.</t2063> <t2064>Margaret, with her mother's permission, also accepted, and Marianne, although always reluctant to attend these meetings, was convinced by her mother to do the same, as she could not bear to see her isolate herself from every opportunity for enjoyment.</t2064>
<t2065>The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton found herself happily safe from the terrible solitude that had threatened her.</t2065> <t2066>The gathering was as dull as Elinor had anticipated; it did not produce a single new idea or expression, and nothing could have been less interesting than the entirety of the conversation both in the dining room and in the parlor; the children accompanied them to the latter, and while they remained there, it was too evident that attracting Lucy's attention was impossible to even attempt.</t2066> <t2067>They only left when the tea things were taken away.</t2067> <t2068>The table was then set up for card games, and Elinor began to wonder how she had ever hoped to find time for conversation at the estate.</t2068> <t2069>They all stood up, preparing for a game of cards.</t2069>
<t2070>—I'm glad —Lady Middleton said to Lucy— that you won't be finishing the basket for my poor little Annamaria tonight, because I'm sure it would hurt your eyes to do filigree work by candlelight.</t2070> <t2071>And we will find a way tomorrow to make up for the disappointment of my precious little girl, so I hope she won't mind too much.</t2071>
<t2072>This insinuation was enough; Lucy came to her senses instantly and replied:</t2072>
<t2073>—But, you are absolutely mistaken, Lady Middleton; I was just waiting to know if you can start your game without me, or I would have already started working on the filigree.</t2073> <t2074>I wouldn't disappoint the little angel for anything in the world; and if you want me at the card table now, I am determined to finish the basket after dinner.</t2074>
<t2075>—You are very kind; I hope it doesn't hurt your eyes...</t2075> <t2076>Could you ring the bell so they bring candles to work?</t2076> <t2077>I know my poor little girl would be terribly disappointed if the basket is not finished tomorrow, because although I told her it would definitely not be ready, I am sure she is counting on it being done.</t2077>
<t2078>Lucy approached her work table and sat down at it with a promptness and good cheer that seemed to suggest that her greatest pleasure was making a filigree basket for a spoiled little girl.</t2078>
<t2079>Lady Middleton proposed a game of "casino" to the others.</t2079> <t2080>No one objected, except Marianne, who with her usual disregard for general rules of courtesy, exclaimed:</t2080>
<t2081>—Your honor will kindly excuse me... you know that I detest cards.</t2081> <t2082>I will go to the piano; I haven't played it since it was tuned.</t2082>
<t2083>And without further ceremony, he walked towards the instrument.</t2083>
<t2084>Lady Middleton seemed to be thanking heaven for never having made such a discourteous remark herself.</t2084>
<t2085>—You know, ma'am, that Marianne can never stay away from that instrument for too long —said Elinor, striving to mitigate the offense—; and I am not surprised, because it is the best-tuned piano I have ever had the pleasure of hearing.</t2085>
<t2086>The remaining five were now getting ready to deal the cards.</t2086>
<t2087>—Perhaps —continued Elinor—, if I were to step out of the game, I could be of some use to Miss Lucy, rolling the papers for her; and there is still so much to do with the basket that, I believe, it will be impossible for her to finish it tonight with her work alone.</t2087> <t2088>I will love that work, if she allows me to take part in it.</t2088>
<t2089>—Of course, I will be very grateful for your help —exclaimed Lucy—, as I have realized that there is still more to do than I thought; And it would be terrible to disappoint dear Annamaria after all.</t2089>
<t2090>—Oh! That would be dreadful, of course —said Miss Steele—.</t2090> <t2091>Poor little heart, how I love her!</t2091>
<t2092>—You are very kind —Lady Middleton said to Elinor—; and since you truly enjoy the work, perhaps you would prefer not to join the game until the next round, or would you like to do so now?</t2092>
<t2093>Elinor gladly took advantage of the first offer, and thus, with a bit of that good manners to which Marianne could never condescend, she simultaneously achieved her own goal and pleased Lady Middleton.</t2093> <t2094>Lucy quickly made room for her, and the two good rivals sat side by side at the same table, and with the utmost harmony, they endeavored to carry on the same task.</t2094> <t2095>The piano, in front of which Marianne, absorbed in her music and thoughts, had forgotten the presence of other people in the room, was fortunately so close to them that Miss Dashwood judged that, protected by its sound, she could broach the subject that interested her without the risk of being overheard at the card table.</t2095>
<t2096>CHAPTER XXIV</t2096>
<t2097>In a firm, yet cautious tone, Elinor began like this:</t2097>
<t2098>—I would not be worthy of the confidence you have placed in me if I did not wish to prolong it, or if I did not feel greater curiosity about this topic.</t2098> <t2099>I will not apologize, then, for bringing it up again.</t2099>
<t2100>—Thank you —exclaimed Lucy warmly— for breaking the ice; it has calmed my heart, as I feared I might have offended you in some way with what I said on Monday.</t2100>
<t2101>—Offend me!</t2101> <t2102>How could you think such a thing?</t2102> <t2103>Believe me —and Elinor spoke with total sincerity—, nothing could be further from my intention than to give you such an idea.</t2103> <t2104>Could there have been a motive behind your confidence that was not honest and flattering to me?</t2104>
<t2105>—And yet, I assure you —replied Lucy, her sharp little eyes loaded with intention—, it seemed to me that I perceived a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me feel very uncomfortable.</t2105> <t2106>I was sure that you had gotten angry with me; and since then I have reproached myself for having taken the liberty to trouble you with my affairs.</t2106> <t2107>But I am immensely glad to discover that it was only my imagination, and that you do not blame me for it.</t2107> <t2108>If you knew what great comfort, what relief for my heart it was to talk to you about that which I am always, every moment of my life, thinking about, I am sure that your compassion would make you overlook everything else.</t2108>
<t2109>—Certainly, it is easy for me to believe that it was a great relief for you to tell me what is happening, and you can be sure that you will never have reasons to regret it.</t2109> <t2110>Your case is very unfortunate; I see you surrounded by difficulties, and you will need all the affection you have for each other to be able to withstand them.</t2110> <t2111>Mr. Ferrars, I believe, depends entirely on his mother.</t2111>
<t2112>—He only has two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to marry on that basis, although for my part I could give up any other prospect without a sigh.</t2112> <t2113>I have always been accustomed to a very small income, and for him, I could face any poverty; but I love him too much to be the selfish instrument through which he might be deprived of everything his mother could give him if he married to her liking.</t2113> <t2114>We must wait, it may be for many years.</t2114> <t2115>With almost any other man in the world, it would be a dreadful prospect; but I know that nothing can deprive me of Edward's affection and fidelity.</t2115>
<t2116>—Such conviction must be everything to you; and undoubtedly he relies on the same confidence in the feelings you have for him.</t2116> <t2117>If the strength of your mutual affection had waned, as would naturally happen with so many people in so many circumstances over a four-year engagement, your situation would undoubtedly be regrettable.</t2117>
<t2118>Lucy looked up; but Elinor was careful that her face did not show any expression that might give a suspicious turn to her words.</t2118>
<t2119>—Edward's love —said Lucy— has already been tested by our long, long separation since our engagement, and he has borne his troubles so well that it would be unforgivable on my part to doubt him now.</t2119> <t2120>I can say without risk of being wrong that never, from the first day, has he given me a moment of alarm in this regard.</t2120>
<t2121>Elinor could barely tell whether to smile or sigh at such an assertion.</t2121>
<t2122>Lucy continued:</t2122>
<t2123>—By nature, I am also somewhat of a jealous temperament, and due to the difference in our situations, considering that he knows so much more about the world than I do, and because of our constant separation, I had quite a tendency towards suspicion, which would have allowed me to quickly discover the truth if there had been the slightest change in his behavior towards me when we met, or any decline in spirits for which I had no explanation, or if he had spoken more of one lady than another, or seemed in any way less happy at Longstaple than he used to be.</t2123> <t2124>It is not my intention to say that I am particularly observant or perceptive in general, but in such a case I am sure that I could not be deceived.</t2124>
<t2125>“All this,” thought Elinor, “sounds very nice, but it cannot deceive either of us.”</t2125>
<t2126>—But —he said after a brief silence—, what plans do you have?</t2126> <t2127>Or do you have none, except to wait for Mrs. Ferrars to die, which is such an extreme, terrible, and sad measure?</t2127> <t2128>Is her son determined to submit to this, and to all the tedium of the many years of waiting it may involve for you, rather than risk displeasing his mother for a while by admitting the truth?</t2128>
<t2129>—If we could be sure it would only be for a while!</t2129> <t2130>But Mrs. Ferrars is a very stubborn and proud woman, and it is very likely that, in her first fit of anger upon hearing it, she would leave everything to Robert; and that possibility, thinking of Edward's well-being, drives away any temptation in me to take hasty measures.</t2130>
<t2131>—And also for his own good, or he is taking his indifference beyond all reason.</t2131>
<t2132>Lucy looked at Elinor again, and remained silent.</t2132>
<t2133>"Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" Elinor asked her.</t2133>
<t2134>—Not at all... I have never seen him; but I imagine him to be very different from his brother: foolish and a great braggart.</t2134>
<t2135>—A great braggart! —repeated Miss Steele, who had managed to overhear these words during a sudden pause in Marianne's music—.</t2135> <t2136>Ah! It seems they are talking about their favorite suitors.</t2136>
<t2137>—No, sister —exclaimed Lucy—, you are wrong about that, our favorite suitors are not big braggarts.</t2137>
<t2138>I can vouch that Miss Dashwood's is not —said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; he is one of the simplest young men, with the nicest manners that I have ever seen.</t2138> <t2139>But as for Lucy, this creature knows how to disguise so well that there is no way to know who she likes.</t2139>
<t2140>—Ah! —exclaimed Miss Steele, casting them a suggestive glance—, I can say that Lucy's suitor is as simple and charming in manners as Miss Dashwood's.</t2140>
<t2141>Elinor blushed involuntarily.</t2141> <t2142>Lucy bit her lips and looked very angrily at her sister.</t2142> <t2143>A general silence settled in the room for a while.</t2143> <t2144>Lucy was the first to break it by saying in a lower tone, although at that moment Marianne was providing them with the powerful protection of a magnificent concert:</t2144>
<t2145>—I will lay out without any pretense a plan that has just occurred to me to handle this matter; in truth, I am obliged to let you in on the secret because you are one of the interested parties.</t2145> <t2146>I would venture to say that you have seen Edward enough to know that he would prefer the church over any other profession.</t2146> <t2147>Now, my plan is for him to be ordained as soon as possible and then for you to intercede with your brother, which I am sure you will generously do out of friendship for him and, I hope, some affection for me, to convince him to give Edward the Norland benefice; as I understand, it is very good and it is unlikely that the current holder will live much longer.</t2147> <t2148>That would be enough for us to marry, and we would leave time and opportunities to provide the rest.</t2148>
<t2149>—It will always be a pleasure for me —replied Elinor— to deliver any token of affection and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but, don't you notice that my intervention on this occasion would be completely unnecessary?</t2149> <t2150>He is the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood... that should suffice as a recommendation for her husband.</t2150>
<t2151>—But Mrs. John Dashwood does not really approve of Edward taking orders.</t2151>
<t2152>—Then I suspect that my intervention would have little effect.</t2152>
<t2153>They fell silent again for several minutes.</t2153> <t2154>Finally, Lucy exclaimed with a great sigh:</t2154>
<t2155>—I believe the wisest thing would be to put an end to the whole matter at once by breaking off the engagement.</t2155> <t2156>It seems that there are so many difficulties besetting us from all sides that, although it may make us unhappy for a while, in the long run, we might be better off.</t2156> <t2157>But, wouldn't you advise me, Miss Dashwood?</t2157>
<t2158>—No —responded Elinor, with a smile that concealed great agitation—, on such a subject of course I will not.</t2158> <t2159>You know perfectly well that my opinion would carry no weight with you, unless it supported your wishes.</t2159>
<t2160>"—Indeed, it is unfair to me," replied Lucy with great solemnity; "I do not know anyone whose judgment I respect as much as yours; and I truly believe that if you were to say to me, 'I advise you that, no matter the cost, you should end your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be best for the happiness of both,' I would not hesitate to do so immediately."</t2160>
<t2161>Elinor blushed at the insincerity of Edward's future wife, and replied:</t2161>
<t2162>Such a compliment would be absolutely effective in driving away any possibility of me giving my opinion on this matter, if I had any.</t2162> <t2163>You give too much value to my influence; the power to separate two people united so tenderly is too much for someone who is not an interested party.</t2163>
<t2164>—It is precisely because he is not an interested party —said Lucy, with a certain spite and emphasizing those words in a special way— that his opinion could justly have such an influence on me.</t2164> <t2165>If it could be assumed that his opinion would be biased in any way by his own feelings, it would not be worth having.</t2165>
<t2166>Elinor thought it wiser not to respond to this, lest they push each other into speaking with a freedom and frankness that could not be convenient, and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again.</t2166> <t2167>Thus, this conversation was followed by a pause of several minutes, and it was Lucy who ended it once again.</t2167>
<t2168>—Will you be in the city this winter, Miss Dashwood? —he said to her, with his usual kindness.</t2168>
<t2169>—Of course not.</t2169>
<t2170>—How sorry I am —the other replied, her eyes shining at the information—.</t2170> <t2171>I would have loved to see her there!</t2171> <t2172>But I would bet that she is going to go anyway.</t2172> <t2173>Surely, her brother and sister will invite her to their house.</t2173>
<t2174>—I won't be able to accept their invitation, if they make one.</t2174>
<t2175>—What a shame!</t2175> <t2176>I was so confident that we would meet there.</t2176> <t2177>Anne and I will go at the end of January to visit some relatives who have been asking us to visit them for years.</t2177> <t2178>But I am going only to see Edward.</t2178> <t2179>He will be there in February; if it weren't for that, London would have no appeal for me; I don't have the spirit for it.</t2179>
<t2180>It did not take long before the first round of cards ended and Elinor was called to the table, which put an end to the private conversation between the two ladies, something to which neither of them offered much resistance, because nothing had been said on that occasion that made them feel any less displeased with each other than they had felt before.</t2180> <t2181>Elinor sat at the table with the sad conviction that Edward not only did not love the person who was to be his wife, but that he had no chance of achieving even an acceptable level of happiness in marriage, something he might have had if she, his fiancée, had loved him sincerely, for only self-interest could induce a woman to bind a man to a commitment that clearly burdened him.</t2181>
<t2182>From that moment, Elinor never brought up the subject again; and when Lucy mentioned it, who never missed an opportunity to introduce it into the conversation and took special care to let her confidante know her happiness each time she received a letter from Edward, the former handled it with calm and caution and dismissed it as soon as good manners allowed, for she felt that such conversations were a concession that Lucy did not deserve, and that for her it was dangerous.</t2182>
<t2183>The visit of the Misses Steele to Barton Park extended far beyond what the initial invitation had suggested.</t2183> <t2184>Their appreciation increased, they couldn't do without them; Sir John refused to hear of their departure; despite the numerous commitments they had in Exeter and the fact that they had been made a long time ago, despite their absolute obligation to return to fulfill them immediately, which was felt imperatively every weekend, they were persuaded to stay almost two months at the estate, and help in the proper celebration of those festivities that require more than the usual amount of private dances and large dinners to proclaim their importance.</t2184>
<t2185>CHAPTER XXV</t2185>
<t2186>Although Mrs. Jennings was accustomed to spending much of the year in the homes of her children and friends, she did not lack a permanent residence of her own.</t2186> <t2187>Since the death of her husband, who had successfully traded in a less elegant part of the city, she spent every winter in a house located on one of the streets near Portman Square.</t2187> <t2188>Towards it she began to direct her thoughts as January approached, and to it one day, suddenly and unexpectedly, she invited the two elder Miss Dashwoods to accompany her.</t2188> <t2189>Elinor, without noticing the changes in her sister's complexion and the lively expression in her eyes, which revealed that the plan was not indifferent to her, immediately refused, gratefully but firmly, on behalf of both, believing she was taking charge of a shared desire.</t2189> <t2190>The reason she cited was her firm decision not to leave her mother at that time of year.</t2190> <t2191>Mrs. Jennings received the refusal of her invitation with some surprise and immediately repeated it.</t2191>
<t2192>—Oh, God!</t2192> <t2193>I am sure that your mother can do very well without you, and I beg you to grant me the favor of your company, because I have placed all my hopes on it.</t2193> <t2194>Do not imagine that you will be any trouble to me, because I will not do anything out of the ordinary to attend to you.</t2194> <t2195>It will only mean sending Betty in the post coach, and I trust that I can afford that.</t2195> <t2196>The three of us will be very comfortable in my chaise; and when we are in the city, if you do not wish to go where I go, that's perfectly fine, you can always go out with one of my daughters.</t2196> <t2197>I am sure that your mother will not oppose it, for I have been so lucky in getting my children off my hands, that she will consider me a very suitable person to be in charge of you; and if I do not manage to marry off at least one of you before concluding the matter, it will not be my fault.</t2197> <t2198>I will speak well of you to all the young men, you can be sure of that.</t2198>
<t2199>—I have the idea —said Sir John— that Miss Marianne would not oppose such a plan if her older sister agreed to it.</t2199> <t2200>It is very hard, indeed, that she cannot have a little distraction, just because Miss Dashwood does not wish it.</t2200> <t2201>So I would recommend to both of you that you head to the city when you tire of Barton, without saying a word about it to Miss Dashwood.</t2201>
<t2202>—No —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings—, I am sure I will be terribly happy with Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood comes or not, only that the more, the merrier, I say, and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together; because if they get tired of me, they can talk to each other, and laugh at my oddities behind my back.</t2202> <t2203>But one or the other, if not both, I must have.</t2203> <t2204>God bless me!</t2204> <t2205>How can you imagine that I can live wandering around alone, I who until this winter have always been used to having Charlotte with me.</t2205> <t2206>Come now, Miss Marianne, let's shake hands to seal this deal, and if Miss Dashwood changes her mind later, so much the better.</t2206>
<t2207>—I thank you, madam, from the bottom of my heart I thank you —said Marianne warmly—; your invitation has bound my gratitude forever, and being able to accept it would make me so happy... yes, it would be almost the greatest happiness I can imagine.</t2207> <t2208>But my mother, my dearest, kind mother... I think what Elinor has suggested is very fair, and if our absence were to make her less happy, were to take away her comfort...</t2208> <t2209>Oh, no!</t2209> <t2210>Nothing could induce me to leave her.</t2210> <t2211>This cannot mean, must not mean a conflict.</t2211>
<t2212>Mrs. Jennings repeated once again how sure she was that Mrs. Dashwood could get along very well without them; and Elinor, who now understood her sister and saw how indifferent to almost everything else her anxiety to see Willoughby again made her, did not raise any further direct objection to the plan; she simply referred it to her mother's will, from whom, however, she did not expect much support in her effort to prevent a visit that seemed so inconvenient for Marianne, and which she also had a special interest in avoiding for her own sake.</t2212> <t2213>In everything Marianne desired, her mother was eager to please her; she could not hope to induce the latter to behave cautiously in a matter regarding which she had never been able to inspire distrust, and she did not dare to explain the cause of her own reluctance to go to London.</t2213> <t2214>That Marianne, fussy as she was, perfectly aware of Mrs. Jennings' behavior which so displeased her, in her efforts to achieve her goal was willing to overlook all such annoyances and ignore what most irritated her sensitivity, was such a strong, full proof of the importance she attached to that goal, that despite everything that had happened, it surprised Elinor, as if nothing had prepared her to witness it.</t2214>
<t2215>When they told her about the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, convinced that such an outing could mean many amusements for her two daughters and perceiving through all of Marianne's affectionate attentions how excited she was about the trip, did not want to hear of refusing the offer on her account; she insisted that they accept immediately and began to imagine, with her usual cheerfulness, the various advantages that this separation would bring for all of them.</t2215>
<t2216>—I love this plan —she exclaimed—, it is exactly what I would have wished for.</t2216> <t2217>It will benefit Margaret and me as much as it will benefit you.</t2217> <t2218>When you and the Middletons have left, how peaceful and happy we will be together, with our books and our music!</t2218> <t2219>You will find Margaret so grown up when you return!</t2219> <t2220>And I also have a small plan for rearranging your bedrooms, which I can now carry out without inconveniencing you.</t2220> <t2221>I think you need to go to the city; in my opinion, all young women in your circumstances should know the customs and amusements of London.</t2221> <t2222>You will be in the care of a good woman, very maternal, whose kindness I have no doubt about.</t2222> <t2223>And most likely you will see your brother, and whatever his faults, or those of his wife, when I think of whose son he is, I would not want to see you so far apart from each other.</t2223>
<t2224>—Although with his usual concern for our happiness —said Elinor— he has been overlooking all the obstacles to this plan that he could imagine, there remains an objection that, in my opinion, cannot be dismissed so easily.</t2224>
<t2225>An enormous discouragement appeared on Marianne's face.</t2225>
<t2226>—And what is it —said Mrs. Dashwood— that my dear and prudent Elinor is going to suggest?</t2226> <t2227>What formidable obstacle is she going to put before us?</t2227> <t2228>I don't want to hear a single word about the cost it will have.</t2228>
<t2229>—My objection is this: although I have a very good opinion of Mrs. Jennings' kindness, she is not the type of woman whose company will be pleasant for us, or whose protection will elevate our status.</t2229>
<t2230>—That is very true —replied her mother—, but in their sole company, without other people, they will hardly be alone, and they will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton.</t2230>
<t2231>—If Elinor refrains from going because of the displeasure Mrs. Jennings causes her —said Marianne—, at least let that not prevent me from accepting her invitation.</t2231> <t2232>I have no such scruples and I am sure I can tolerate without much effort all the inconveniences of that kind.</t2232>
<t2233>Elinor could not help but smile at this display of indifference regarding the social behavior of a person towards whom it had often been difficult for her to obtain at least acceptable courtesy from Marianne, and inwardly she decided that if her sister insisted on going, she would go too, for she did not think it right to leave Marianne in a situation where she had to rely solely on her own judgment, or to leave Mrs. Jennings at the mercy of Marianne as her only solace in her home hours.</t2233> <t2234>This decision was easier for her to accept upon remembering that Edward Ferrars, according to what Lucy had informed her, would not be in the city before February, and that by then her and her sister's stay, without having to shorten it in any absurd way, would already be over.</t2234>
<t2235>—I want both of you to go —said Mrs. Dashwood—; these objections are nonsense.</t2235> <t2236>You will have a lot of fun in London, and even more if you are together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to accept in advance the possibility of enjoying herself, she would see that in the city she could do so in countless ways; she might even like the opportunity to improve her relations with her sister-in-law's family.</t2236>
<t2237>Elinor had often wished for an opportunity to gradually weaken her mother's confidence in the relationship between her and Edward, so that the blow would be lessened when the whole truth came to light; and now, faced with this onslaught, though with almost no hope of succeeding, she forced herself to begin her plans, saying with all the calmness she could muster:</t2237>
<t2238>—I like Edward Ferrars very much and I will always be happy to see him; but as for the rest of the family, I am completely indifferent as to whether they ever get to know me or not.</t2238>
<t2239>Mrs. Dashwood smiled and said nothing.</t2239> <t2240>Marianne looked up in astonishment, and Elinor thought it would have been better to keep her mouth shut.</t2240>
<t2241>After mulling over the matter very little more, it was finally decided that they would fully accept the invitation.</t2241> <t2242>Upon hearing this, Mrs. Jennings showed great signs of joy and offered them all kinds of assurances about her affection and the care she would take of the young women.</t2242> <t2243>And not only was she happy; Sir John was delighted, because for a man whose greatest anxiety was the fear of being alone, adding two more to the inhabitants of London was not something to be dismissed.</t2243> <t2244>Even Lady Middleton took the trouble to be delighted, which for her was a bit out of her usual way; as for the Misses Steele, especially Lucy, they had never been happier in their entire lives than upon hearing this news.</t2244>
<t2245>Elinor submitted to the preparations that went against her wishes with much less displeasure than she had expected to feel.</t2245> <t2246>As far as she was concerned, going or not going to the city was no longer a matter that worried her; and when she saw her mother so fully content with the plan, and the happiness in the face, voice, and behavior of her sister; when she saw her regain her usual animation and even go beyond what had been her customary joy, she could not feel dissatisfied with the cause of it all and did not want to allow herself to distrust the consequences.</t2246>
<t2247>Marianne's jubilation almost went beyond happiness, so great was her agitation and her impatience to leave.</t2247> <t2248>The only thing that calmed her was her little desire to leave her mother; and at the moment of departure, her grief over it was immense.</t2248> <t2249>Her mother's sadness was only slightly less, and Elinor was the only one of the three who seemed to consider the separation as something less than eternal.</t2249>
<t2250>They departed the first week of January.</t2250> <t2251>The Middletons would follow them about a week later.</t2251> <t2252>The Misses Steele were still on the estate, which they would leave only with the rest of the family.</t2252>
<t2253>CHAPTER XXVI</t2253>
<t2254>Seeing herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and embarking on a journey to London under her protection and as her guest, Elinor could not help but ponder her own situation: so brief was the time they had known each other, so incompatible in age and temperament, and so many objections she had raised against this trip just a few days before!</t2254> <t2255>But all these objections had succumbed, overwhelmed by that happy youthful enthusiasm that both Marianne and her mother shared; and Elinor, despite her occasional doubts about Willoughby's constancy, could not contemplate the rapture of the marvelous anticipation to which Marianne was surrendered, overflowing in her soul and illuminating her eyes, without feeling how empty her own prospects were, how lacking in joy her own state of mind compared to hers, and how willingly she would live the same anxiety as Marianne if it meant having the same invigorating objective, the same possibility of hope.</t2255> <t2256>But now there was little, very little time left, to know Willoughby's intentions: surely he was already in the city.</t2256> <t2257>The eagerness to depart that Marianne displayed was a clear sign of her confidence in finding him there; and Elinor was determined not only to find out everything she could about the young man's character, whether through her own observations or what others might inform her, but also to watch his conduct towards her sister with such jealous attention that it would allow her to be sure of what he was and his intentions before they had met many times.</t2257> <t2258>If the result of her observations was unfavorable, she was determined to open her sister's eyes in whatever way she could; if not, the task ahead would be different: she would have to learn to avoid selfish comparisons and banish from herself any regret that might diminish her satisfaction for Marianne's happiness.</t2258>
<t2259>The journey lasted three days, and Marianne's behavior throughout the trip provided a good indication of what could be expected in the future regarding her deference and affability towards Mrs. Jennings.</t2259> <t2260>She remained silent for almost the entire way, wrapped in her own thoughts and hardly ever speaking of her own accord, except when some picturesque object of beauty appeared before her eyes, eliciting some expression of joy, which she directed exclusively to her sister.</t2260> <t2261>To compensate for this behavior, however, Elinor immediately took on the duty of courtesy she had set for herself, was extremely attentive to Mrs. Jennings, conversed with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever possible; and Mrs. Jennings, for her part, treated them both with all imaginable kindness, constantly ensuring they were comfortable and entertained, and was only displeased by her inability to get them to choose their own dinner at the inn or to make them confess whether they preferred salmon or cod, boiled chicken or veal chops.</t2261> <t2262>They arrived in the city around three in the afternoon on the third day, happy to be freed, after such a long journey, from the confinement of the carriage, and ready to enjoy the luxury of a good fire.</t2262>
<t2263>The house was beautiful and was beautifully equipped, and they immediately provided the young women with a very comfortable room.</t2263>
<t2264>It had belonged to Charlotte, and above the fireplace mantel there still hung a landscape made by her in colored silks, proof of having spent seven years in a great city school, with some results.</t2264>
<t2265>Since dinner was not going to be ready until two hours after their arrival, Elinor wanted to use that time to write to her mother, and she sat down ready to do so.</t2265> <t2266>A few minutes later, Marianne did the same.</t2266>
<t2267>– I am writing home, Marianne —Elinor said to her—; wouldn't it be better if you left your letter for one or two more days?</t2267>
<t2268>– I am not going to write to my mother —replied Marianne hastily, as if wanting to avoid further questions.</t2268>
<t2269>Elinor said nothing more; it immediately occurred to her that Marianne must be writing to Willoughby and she instantly concluded that, regardless of the mystery they might want to shroud their relationship in, they must be engaged.</t2269> <t2270>This conviction, although not completely satisfactory, pleased her, and she continued her letter with the greatest haste.</t2270> <t2271>Marianne finished hers in a few minutes; in length, it could not be more than a note; she folded it, sealed it, and wrote the address with anxious speed.</t2271> <t2272>Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the address, and had just finished when Marianne, ringing the bell, asked the servant who answered to have that letter sent to the two-penny post.</t2272> <t2273>With this, the matter was considered settled.</t2273>
<t2274>Marianne remained in very good spirits, but a restlessness fluttered within her that prevented her sister from feeling completely satisfied, and this restlessness increased as the afternoon wore on.</t2274>
<t2275>He could barely take a bite during dinner, and when they later returned to the living room, he seemed to listen with enormous anxiety to the noise of every carriage that passed by.</t2275>
<t2276>It was a great relief for Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, being occupied in her rooms, could not see what was happening.</t2276> <t2277>They brought the things for tea, and Marianne had already experienced more than one disappointment at the knocks on some neighboring door, when suddenly there was a very loud one that could not be mistaken for one in another house.</t2277> <t2278>Elinor felt sure it announced Willoughby's arrival, and Marianne, jumping up, headed towards the door.</t2278> <t2279>Everything was silent; it lasted no more than a few seconds, she opened the door, took a few steps towards the staircase, and after listening for half a minute, returned to the room in that state of agitation that the certainty of having heard him would naturally produce.</t2279> <t2280>In the midst of the ecstasy reached by her emotions at that moment, she could not help but exclaim:</t2280>
<t2281>—Oh, Elinor, it's Willoughby, I'm sure it's him!</t2281>
<t2282>She seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.</t2282>
<t2283>It was too great a blow to bear with serenity, and Marianne immediately left the room.</t2283> <t2284>Elinor was also disappointed; but, at the same time, her regard for Colonel Brandon allowed her to welcome him, and it pained her especially that a man who showed such great interest in her sister should notice that all Marianne felt upon seeing him was sorrow and disappointment.</t2284> <t2285>She soon observed that it had not gone unnoticed by him, that he had even looked at Marianne as she left the room with such astonishment and concern that it almost made him forget what courtesy demanded towards her.</t2285>
<t2286>—Is your sister sick? —he asked her.</t2286>
<t2287>Elinor responded with some agitation that she was, and then referred to headaches, discouragement, and excessive fatigue, and to everything that could decently explain her sister's behavior.</t2287>
<t2288>He listened to her with the most intense attention, but, pretending to calm down, he did not speak further on the matter and began to elaborate on his pleasure at seeing them in London, with the usual questions about the trip and the friends they had left behind.</t2288>
<t2289>Thus, in a calm manner, without much interest from either side, they continued talking, both discouraged and with their minds on other things.</t2289> <t2290>Elinor had a great desire to ask if Willoughby was in the city, but she feared to sadden him with questions about his rival; until finally, to say something, she asked if he had been in London since the last time they had seen each other.</t2290>
<t2291>—Yes —he replied, slightly troubled—, almost all the time since then; I have been to Delaford once or twice for a few days, but I have never been able to return to Barton.</t2291>
<t2292>This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately reminded Elinor of all the circumstances of her departure from that place, with the unease and suspicions that had arisen in Mrs. Jennings, and she feared that her question had implied a curiosity about that subject much greater than she had ever felt.</t2292>
<t2293>Mrs. Jennings soon appeared in the room.</t2293>
<t2294>—Oh, Colonel! —she said with her usual noisy cheerfulness—, I am terribly happy to see you... forgive me if I didn't come earlier... I beg you to excuse me, but I had to check a few things here and sort out my affairs, because I hadn't been home for a long time, and you know there are always a world of little details to attend to when one has been away for a while; and then I had to deal with Cartwright's matters.</t2294> <t2295>Heavens, I've been working like an ant since dinner time!</t2295> <t2296>But, tell me, Colonel, how did you guess that I would be in town today?</t2296>
<t2297>—I had the pleasure of hearing him at Mr. Palmer's house, where I have been dining.</t2297>
<t2298>—Ah, so it was! And, how is everyone there? How is Charlotte?</t2298> <t2299>I could assure you that she must be quite grown by now.</t2299>
<t2300>—Mrs. Palmer looked very well, and she asked me to tell you that she will definitely see you tomorrow.</t2300>
<t2301>—Sure, of course, that's what I thought.</t2301> <t2302>Well, Colonel, I have brought two young ladies with me, as you can see... I mean, you can only see one of them, but there is another one somewhere.</t2302> <t2303>Her friend, Miss Marianne, also... as I imagine you won't regret knowing.</t2303> <t2304>I don't know how you and Mr. Willoughby will manage regarding her.</t2304> <t2305>Yes, it's a great thing to be young and beautiful.</t2305> <t2306>Well, I was young once, but I was never very beautiful... bad luck for me.</t2306> <t2307>Nevertheless, I got myself a very good husband, and who knows if the greatest beauties can do more than that.</t2307> <t2308>Ah, poor man!</t2308> <t2309>He's been dead for eight years now, and he's better off that way.</t2309> <t2310>But, Colonel, where have you been since we last saw each other?</t2310> <t2311>And how are your affairs going?</t2311> <t2312>Come on, come on, let there be no secrets between friends.</t2312>
<t2313>The colonel answered all their questions with his usual meekness, but without satisfying their curiosity in any of them.</t2313> <t2314>Elinor had begun to prepare the tea, and Marianne was forced to return to the room.</t2314>
<t2315>After his entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than before, and Mrs. Jennings could not convince him to stay longer.</t2315> <t2316>No other visitors arrived that afternoon, and the ladies agreed to go to bed early.</t2316>
<t2317>Marianne woke up the next day with renewed spirits and a cheerful demeanor.</t2317> <t2318>She seemed to have forgotten the disappointment of the previous evening in light of the expectations for what might happen that day.</t2318> <t2319>They had not long finished their breakfast when Mrs. Palmer's carriage stopped at the door, and a few minutes later she entered the room laughing, so delighted to see everyone that it was hard to tell whether her pleasure was greater at seeing her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again.</t2319> <t2320>So surprised by their arrival in town, although it was what she had been expecting all along!</t2320> <t2321>So angry that they had accepted her mother's invitation after refusing hers, although at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they hadn't come!</t2321>
<t2322>—Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you —he said—; what do you think he said when he found out you were coming with mom?</t2322> <t2323>Right now I can't remember what it was, but it was something so funny!</t2323>
<t2324>After one or two hours spent in what her mother called a quiet chat or, in other words, countless questions from Mrs. Jennings about all their acquaintances, and laughter without reason from Mrs. Palmer, the latter suggested that they all accompany her to some shops where she had errands to run that morning, to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor promptly agreed, as they also had some shopping to do; and Marianne, although she declined the invitation at first, was persuaded to go as well.</t2324>
<t2325>It was evident that, wherever they went, she was always alert.</t2325> <t2326>On Bond Street, especially, where most of the places they had to visit were located, her eyes were in constant search; and in any store the group entered, she, absorbed in her thoughts, could not get interested in anything in front of her that occupied the others.</t2326> <t2327>Restless and dissatisfied everywhere, her sister could not get her to give her opinion on any item she wanted to buy, even if it concerned both of them; she enjoyed nothing; she was just impatient to return home again, and barely managed to control her annoyance at the tedium caused by Mrs. Palmer, whose eyes were caught by anything pretty, expensive, or novel; who went crazy wanting to buy everything, couldn't decide on anything, and wasted time between ecstasy and indecision.</t2327>
<t2328>It was already late in the morning when they returned home; and no sooner had they entered, Marianne anxiously ran upstairs, and when Elinor followed her, she found her moving away from the table with a disconsolate expression, which clearly indicated that Willoughby had not been there.</t2328>
<t2329>—Haven't they left any letters for me since we left? —he asked the servant who was entering with the packages at that moment.</t2329> <t2330>The answer was negative—.</t2330> <t2331>Are you sure? —he said to him—.</t2331> <t2332>Are you sure that no servant, no concierge has left any letter, any note?</t2332>
<t2333>The man replied that no one had come.</t2333>
<t2334>—How strange! —said Marianne in a low, disenchanted tone, as she moved towards the window.</t2334>
<t2335>“Truly, how strange!” said Elinor to herself, looking at her sister with great unease.</t2335> <t2336>“If she didn't know that he is in the city, she wouldn't have written to him as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna; and if he is in the city, how strange that he hasn't come or written!</t2336> <t2337>Ah, dear mother, you must be mistaken in allowing such a doubtful and obscure engagement between such a young daughter and a man so little known!</t2337> <t2338>I am dying to ask, but how will they take it if I meddle!”</t2338>
<t2339>He decided, after some considerations, that if appearances remained as unpleasant as they were at that moment for many days, he would make his mother see the necessity of seriously investigating the matter as forcefully as possible.</t2339>
<t2340>Mrs. Palmer and two older ladies, close acquaintances of Mrs. Jennings, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with them.</t2340> <t2341>The first left them shortly after tea to fulfill her evening commitments; and Elinor was obliged to complete a whist table for the others.</t2341> <t2342>Marianne contributed nothing on these occasions, as she had never learned that game, but although the hours of the evening were thus left entirely at her disposal, they were no more beneficial to her in terms of distraction than they were for Elinor, because they passed for her laden with all the anxiety of waiting and the pain of disappointment.</t2342> <t2343>_ At times she tried to read for a few minutes; but soon she would cast the book aside and once again devote herself to the more interesting occupation of pacing the room back and forth, stopping for a moment each time she reached the window, hoping to hear the much-anticipated knock at the door.</t2343>
<t2344>CHAPTER XXVII</t2344>
<t2345>—If this good weather continues —said Mrs. Jennings when they met for breakfast the next morning, Sir John will not want to leave Barton next week; it is a sad thing for a sportsman to miss a day of pleasure.</t2345> <t2346>Poor things!</t2346> <t2347>I pity them when that happens... they seem to take it so much to heart.</t2347>
<t2348>—It's true —exclaimed Marianne cheerfully, and she walked towards the window as she spoke, to see what the day was like—.</t2348> <t2349>I hadn't thought of that.</t2349> <t2350>This weather will keep many sportsmen out in the field.</t2350>
<t2351>It was a fortunate memory that restored all his good spirits.</t2351>
<t2352>—It truly is a wonderful time for them —he continued, as he sat at the table with an air of happiness—.</t2352> <t2353>How they must be enjoying it!</t2353> <t2354>But —again with some anxiety—, it cannot be expected to last too long.</t2354> <t2355>At this time of year, and after so much rain, it surely won't stay this good.</t2355> <t2356>Soon the frosts will come, and they will most likely be severe.</t2356> <t2357>Maybe in one or two days; this mild weather cannot last much longer... no, it might freeze tonight!</t2357>
<t2358>—In any case —said Elinor, intending to prevent Mrs. Jennings from deciphering her sister's thoughts as clearly as she could—, I would say that we will have Sir John and Lady Middleton in the city by the end of next week.</t2358>
<t2359>—Of course, dear, I assure you it will be so.</t2359> <t2360>Mary always gets her way.</t2360>
<t2361>"And now," Elinor silently conjectured, "Marianne will write to Combe in today's mail."</t2361>
<t2362>But if it was that he did it, the discretion with which the letter was written and sent managed to elude Elinor's vigilance, who could not ascertain the fact.</t2362> <t2363>Whatever the truth was, and as far as Elinor was from feeling completely satisfied about it, as long as she saw Marianne in good spirits, she could not feel too displeased either.</t2363> <t2364>And Marianne was in good spirits, happy with the mild weather and even more pleased with her expectations of a frost.</t2364>
<t2365>They spent the morning mainly handing out business cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings' acquaintances to inform them of her return to the city; and all the while Marianne kept herself occupied by observing the direction of the wind, watching the changes in the sky, and imagining that the air temperature was changing.</t2365>
<t2366>Don't you find it colder than in the morning, Elinor?</t2366> <t2367>It seems to me that there is a marked difference.</t2367> <t2368>I can barely keep my hands warm even in the muff.</t2368> <t2369>I don't think it was like this yesterday.</t2369> <t2370>It looks like it's clearing up too, then the sun will come out and we'll have a clear afternoon.</t2370>
<t2371>Elinor felt at times amused, at times saddened; but Marianne did not give up and every night in the glow of the fire, and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere, she saw the unmistakable signs of an ever-closer frost.</t2371>
<t2372>The Miss Dashwoods had no more reason to be discontented with Mrs. Jennings' way of life and circle of acquaintances than with her behavior towards them, which was always kind.</t2372> <t2373>All her domestic arrangements were made according to the most generous provisions, and except for a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's displeasure, she had never ceased to associate with, she did not visit anyone whose acquaintance could in any way disturb her young companions.</t2373> <t2374>Content to find herself in better conditions in that respect than she had anticipated, Elinor was very willing to compromise with how little entertaining their evening gatherings were, which both at home and elsewhere were organized solely for playing cards, something that offered her little amusement.</t2374>
<t2375>Colonel Brandon, a permanent guest at the house, accompanied them almost every day; he came to gaze at Marianne and to talk with Elinor, who often enjoyed the conversation with him more than any other daily event, but at the same time, she watched with great concern how his interest in her sister persisted.</t2375> <t2376>She even feared that it was becoming more intense.</t2376> <t2377>It saddened her to see the anxiety with which he usually observed Marianne and how he seemed genuinely more discouraged than at Barton.</t2377>
<t2378>Around a week after their arrival, it was evident that Willoughby was also in the city.</t2378> <t2379>When they returned from their morning outing, his card was on the table.</t2379>
<t2380>—Oh, God! —exclaimed Marianne—.</t2380> <t2381>He was here while we were out.</t2381>
<t2382>Elinor, rejoicing to know that Willoughby was in London, ventured to say:</t2382>
<t2383>—You can trust that he will come again tomorrow.</t2383>
<t2384>Marianne barely seemed to listen to her, and when Mrs. Jennings entered, she fled with her precious card.</t2384>
<t2385>This event, along with lifting Elinor's spirits, restored to her sister's all, and more than all, her previous agitation.</t2385> <t2386>From that moment on, her mind knew no moment of tranquility; her expectations of seeing him at any time of the day rendered her incapable of anything else.</t2386> <t2387>The next morning she insisted on staying home when the others went out.</t2387>
<t2388>Elinor could not help but think about what might be happening in Berkeley Street during her absence; but a quick glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her that Willoughby had not appeared for a second time.</t2388> <t2389>At that precise moment, a note was brought in and left on the table.</t2389>
<t2390>—For me! —exclaimed Marianne, hurrying towards her.</t2390>
<t2391>—No, miss; for my lady.</t2391>
<t2392>But Marianne, unconvinced, took it immediately.</t2392>
<t2393>—In truth, it is for Mrs. Jennings.</t2393> <t2394>How tiresome!</t2394>
<t2395>—So, are you expecting a letter? —said Elinor, unable to remain silent any longer.</t2395>
<t2396>—Yes!</t2396> <t2397>A little... not much.</t2397>
<t2398>—You don't trust me —said Elinor, after a short pause.</t2398>
<t2399>—Let's go, Elinor!</t2399> <t2400>You, making such a reproach... you, who trusts no one!</t2400>
<t2401>—Me! —replied Elinor, somewhat confused—.</t2401> <t2402>It's just that, Marianne, I have nothing to say.</t2402>
<t2403>—Neither do I —responded Marianne energetically—; we are then in the same situation.</t2403> <t2404>Neither of us has anything to tell; you because you don't share anything, and I because I hide nothing.</t2404>
<t2405>Elinor, dismayed by this accusation of excessive reserve that she could not ignore, did not know, under such circumstances, how to get Marianne to open up to her.</t2405>
<t2406>Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and upon being given the note, she read it aloud.</t2406> <t2407>It was from Lady Middleton, announcing her arrival at Conduit Street the previous night and requesting the pleasure of her mother's and cousins' company that afternoon.</t2407> <t2408>Some business on Sir John's part, and a severe cold on hers, prevented them from going to Berkeley Street.</t2408> <t2409>The invitation was accepted, but as the appointed time approached, although basic courtesy towards Mrs. Jennings required that both accompany her on this visit, Elinor found it difficult to convince her sister to go, because she still had no news of Willoughby and, therefore, was as unwilling to go out and distract herself as she was reluctant to risk him coming in her absence.</t2409>
<t2410>By the end of the afternoon, Elinor had discovered that a person's nature does not materially change with a change of residence; for although they had just settled in the city, Sir John had managed to gather around him about twenty young people and entertain them with a dance.</t2410> <t2411>Lady Middleton, however, did not approve of this.</t2411> <t2412>In the countryside, an impromptu dance was very acceptable; but in London, where the reputation for elegance was more important and harder to earn, it was risking a lot, to please a few girls, for it to be known that Lady Middleton had hosted a small dance for eight or nine couples, with two violins and a simple refreshment on the sideboard.</t2412>
<t2413>Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were part of the gathering; the former, whom they had not seen since their arrival in the city as he carefully avoided any appearance of attention towards his mother-in-law and thus never approached her, gave no sign of having recognized them upon entering.</t2413> <t2414>He barely looked at them, without seeming to know who they were, and to Mrs. Jennings, he directed a mere nod from across the room.</t2414> <t2415>Marianne glanced around as soon as she entered; it was enough: he was not there... and then she sat down, as unwilling to be entertained as to entertain others.</t2415> <t2416>After having been gathered for about an hour, Mr. Palmer distractedly approached the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise at seeing them in the city, although it was at his house that Colonel Brandon had first heard of their arrival, and he himself had said something very amusing upon learning they were coming.</t2416>
<t2417>—I thought both of you were in Devonshire —he told them.</t2417>
<t2418>—Yes? —Elinor responded.</t2418>
<t2419>—When are they going to return?</t2419>
<t2420>—I don't know.</t2420>
<t2421>And so the conversation ended.</t2421>
<t2422>Never in her entire life had Marianne been so unwilling to dance as that night, and never had the exercise tired her so much.</t2422> <t2423>She complained about it when they were returning to Berkeley Street.</t2423>
<t2424>—Yes, yes —said Mrs. Jennings—, we know very well why that is; if a certain person whom we shall not name had been there, she would not have been the least bit tired; and to tell the truth, it was not very nice of him not to have come to see her, after having been invited.</t2424>
<t2425>—Guest! —exclaimed Marianne.</t2425>
<t2426>—That's what my daughter, Lady Middleton, told me, because apparently Sir John ran into him somewhere this morning.</t2426>
<t2427>Marianne said nothing more, but she seemed to be extremely hurt.</t2427> <t2428>Seeing her like this and eager to do something that might help alleviate her sister, Elinor decided to write to their mother the next day, hoping to awaken some concern in her for Marianne's health and, in this way, get her to make the long-postponed inquiries; and her determination grew stronger when in the morning, after breakfast, she noticed that Marianne was writing to Willoughby again, as she could not imagine it being to anyone else.</t2428>
<t2429>Near midday, Mrs. Jennings went out alone for some errands, and Elinor immediately began the letter, while Marianne, too restless to concentrate on any occupation, too anxious for any conversation, wandered from one window to another or sat by the fire lost in sad musings.</t2429> <t2430>Elinor took great care in her appeal to her mother, telling her everything that had happened, her suspicions about Willoughby's inconstancy, and appealing to her duty and affection, urged her to demand from Marianne an explanation of her true situation regarding the young man.</t2430>
<t2431>She had barely finished her letter when a knock at the door warned them of the arrival of a visitor, and soon Colonel Brandon was announced.</t2431> <t2432>Marianne, who had seen him from the window and at that moment hated any company, left the room before he entered.</t2432> <t2433>The colonel looked more serious than usual, and although he expressed satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had something special to say to her, he sat for a while without uttering a word.</t2433> <t2434>Elinor, convinced that he had something to communicate that concerned her sister, waited impatiently for him to open up.</t2434> <t2435>It was not the first time she had felt the same kind of certainty, for more than once before, starting his comment with the observation "Your sister does not look well today," or "Your sister looks downcast," he had seemed about to reveal, or inquire about, something particular concerning her.</t2435> <t2436>After a pause of several minutes, the colonel broke the silence by asking her, in a tone that revealed a certain agitation, when he should congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother.</t2436> <t2437>Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and having no prompt answer, she was forced to resort to the simple but common expedient of asking him what he meant.</t2437> <t2438>He tried to smile as he replied, "Your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is known to everyone."</t2438>
<t2439>—They can't all know —replied Elinor—, because her own family doesn't know.</t2439>
<t2440>He seemed surprised, and said to her:</t2440>
<t2441>—I beg your pardon, I fear my question may have been impertinent; but I did not think that anything was meant to be kept secret, since you correspond openly and everyone talks about your wedding.</t2441>
<t2442>How is it possible? Who has he/she heard it from?</t2442>
<t2443>—To many... to some whom you do not know, to others who are very close to you: Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons.</t2443> <t2444>But even so, I would not have believed it (because when the mind does not want to be convinced, it will always find something to sustain its doubts), if today I had not accidentally seen in the hands of the servant who opened the door for me, a letter addressed to Mr. Willoughby, in his sister's handwriting.</t2444> <t2445>I came to ask, but I was convinced before I could pose the question.</t2445> <t2446>Is everything finally resolved?</t2446> <t2447>Is it possible that...?</t2447> <t2448>But I have no right, and no chance of success.</t2448> <t2449>Forgive me, Miss Dashwood.</t2449> <t2450>I believe it was not right of me to say so much, but I do not know what to do and I trust absolutely in your discretion.</t2450> <t2451>Tell me that everything is already irrevocable, that any attempt... that, in short, dissembling, if dissembling is possible, is all that remains.</t2451>
<t2452>These words, which were for Elinor such a direct confession of the colonel's love for her sister, affected her deeply.</t2452> <t2453>At the moment she was unable to say anything, and even when she regained her composure, she struggled for a brief time trying to discover what would be the most appropriate response.</t2453> <t2454>The true state of affairs between Willoughby and her sister was so unknown to her, that in trying to explain it she might well say too much, or too little.</t2454> <t2455>However, as she was convinced that Marianne's affection for Willoughby, regardless of the outcome of that affection, left Colonel Brandon with no hope of success, and at the same time wished to protect her from any censure, after thinking for a while she decided that it would be more prudent and considerate to say more than she really believed or knew.</t2455> <t2456>She admitted, then, that although they had never informed her about the nature of their relationship, she had no doubt about their mutual affection and was not surprised to know that they wrote to each other.</t2456>
<t2457>The colonel listened to her in attentive silence, and when she finished speaking, he immediately got up from his seat and, after saying with an emotional voice, "I wish your sister all the imaginable happiness; and to Willoughby, that he strives to deserve it...", he said goodbye and left.</t2457>
<t2458>This conversation did not manage to bring relief to Elinor nor lessen the unease in her mind regarding other matters; on the contrary, she was left with a sad impression of the colonel's unhappiness and could not even wish for that unhappiness to disappear, given her anxiety for the very event that was going to confirm it.</t2458>
<t2459>CHAPTER XXVIII</t2459>
<t2460>Nothing happened in the three or four days following that made Elinor regret having turned to her mother, for Willoughby neither appeared nor wrote.</t2460> <t2461>Towards the end of that period, she and her sister had to accompany Lady Middleton to a party, which Mrs. Jennings could not attend due to the indisposition of her younger daughter; and for this party, Marianne, completely dejected, without caring about her appearance and as if it were indifferent to her whether to go or stay, prepared without a look of hope, without a sign of pleasure.</t2461> <t2462>After tea, she sat by the fireplace in the living room until Lady Middleton arrived, without moving once from her seat or changing her posture, lost in her thoughts and paying no attention to her sister's presence; and when they were finally told that Lady Middleton was waiting for them at the door, she started as if she had forgotten they were expecting someone.</t2462>
<t2463>They arrived on time at their destination, and as soon as the line of carriages in front of them allowed, they disembarked, climbed the steps, heard their names announced loudly from one landing to another, and entered a splendidly lit room, full of guests and unbearably hot.</t2463> <t2464>After fulfilling the duty of courtesy and respectfully greeting the lady of the house, they were able to mingle with the crowd and endure their share of heat and discomfort, necessarily increased by their arrival.</t2464> <t2465>After spending a few moments speaking very little and doing even less, Lady Middleton joined a casino game, and since Marianne was not in the mood to wander around, she and Elinor, having luckily secured a couple of chairs, positioned themselves not far from the table.</t2465>
<t2466>They had not been there for long when Elinor noticed the presence of Willoughby, who was a few yards away in enthusiastic conversation with a very elegant-looking young woman.</t2466> <t2467>Their eyes soon met and he immediately bowed, but without showing any intention of speaking to her or approaching Marianne, although he could not have failed to see her; and then he continued his conversation with the same young woman.</t2467> <t2468>Elinor turned to Marianne almost involuntarily to see if she might have missed him.</t2468> <t2469>It was only at that moment that she saw him, and with her face lit up by sudden joy, she would have approached him immediately if her sister had not stopped her.</t2469>
<t2470>—Good heavens! —he exclaimed—.</t2470> <t2471>He's here, he's here.</t2471> <t2472>Oh! Why doesn't he look at me?</t2472> <t2473>Why can't I go talk to him?</t2473>
<t2474>"Please, please control yourself," exclaimed Elinor, "and do not betray your feelings in front of everyone present."</t2474> <t2475>Perhaps he has not seen you yet.</t2475>
<t2476>This, however, was more than she herself could believe, and controlling herself in a moment like that was not only beyond Marianne's reach, it was beyond her desires.</t2476> <t2477>She sat in an agony of impatience, evident in every one of her features.</t2477>
<t2478>Finally, he turned again and looked at both of them; Marianne stood up and, pronouncing his name with a voice full of affection, extended her hand to him.</t2478> <t2479>He approached, and addressing himself more to Elinor than to Marianne, as if he wanted to avoid her gaze and had decided to ignore her gesture, hurriedly inquired about Mrs. Dashwood and asked how long they had been in the city.</t2479> <t2480>Elinor lost all composure at such an attitude and could not say a word.</t2480> <t2481>But her sister's feelings immediately came to light.</t2481> <t2482>Her face turned red and she exclaimed with enormous emotion in her voice:</t2482>
<t2483>—Holy God! Willoughby, what does this mean? Haven't you received my letters? Won't you shake my hand?</t2483>
<t2484>He could no longer avoid her, but Marianne's touch seemed painful to him, and he held her hand for only an instant.</t2484> <t2485>It was evident that he had been struggling to control himself all this time.</t2485> <t2486>Elinor observed his face and saw that his expression was becoming calmer.</t2486> <t2487>After a brief pause, Willoughby spoke calmly.</t2487>
<t2488>—I had the honor of going to Berkeley Street last Tuesday, and I was very sorry not to have had the luck of finding you and Mrs. Jennings at home.</t2488> <t2489>I hope my card did not get lost.</t2489>
<t2490>—But, haven't you received my notes? —exclaimed Marianne with the fiercest anxiety—.</t2490> <t2491>I'm sure it's a confusion... a terrible confusion.</t2491> <t2492>What can it mean?</t2492> <t2493>Tell me, Willoughby, for God's sake, tell me, what is happening?</t2493>
<t2494>He did not respond; his color changed and he appeared bewildered again; but as if, upon meeting the gaze of the young woman he had been speaking with earlier, he felt the need to make a new effort, he regained control over himself, and after saying, "Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the news of your arrival in the city, which you kindly sent to me," he hurried away with a slight bow and rejoined his friend.</t2494>
<t2495>Marianne, with a terribly pale face and unable to stand, sank into her chair,— and Elinor, fearing she might faint at any moment, tried to shield her from the gazes of others while reviving her with lavender water.</t2495>
<t2496>—Go find him, Elinor —said Marianne as soon as she could speak—, and make him come here.</t2496> <t2497>Tell him that I need to see him again... that I need to speak with him immediately.</t2497> <t2498>I can't rest... I won't have a moment of peace until all this is cleared up... some terrible misunderstanding.</t2498> <t2499>Please, go find him right now!</t2499>
<t2500>—How to do such a thing?</t2500> <t2501>No, my dearest Marianne, you have to wait.</t2501> <t2502>This is not the place for explanations.</t2502> <t2503>Just wait until tomorrow.</t2503>
<t2504>With great difficulty, however, he managed to prevent Marianne from following him; and convincing her to control her agitation, to wait with at least the appearance of composure until she could speak with him more privately and with a better chance of obtaining results, was impossible for him.</t2504>
<t2505>In a low voice and through exclamations of pain, Marianne continued to give free rein to the misery that flooded her feelings.</t2505> <t2506>After a few moments, Elinor saw that Willoughby was leaving the room through the door that led to the staircase, and telling Marianne that he had already gone, she made her see the impossibility of speaking with him that same night as a new argument to calm her down.</t2506> <t2507>Marianne immediately begged her sister to urge Lady Middleton to take them home, as she felt too miserable to stay another minute.</t2507>
<t2508>Lady Middleton, although in the middle of a round of her casino game, upon learning that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to refuse her desire to leave even for a moment, and after passing her cards to a friend, they departed as soon as they found their carriage.</t2508> <t2509>They barely exchanged words during their return to Berkeley Street.</t2509> <t2510>Marianne was in a state of silent agony, too dejected even to shed tears; but as fortunately Mrs. Jennings had not yet returned home, they were able to go directly to their rooms, where with ammonia salts she somewhat revived.</t2510> <t2511>She soon undressed and went to bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, Elinor left her; and while she awaited Mrs. Jennings' return, she had ample time to reflect on everything that had happened.</t2511>
<t2512>That some kind of commitment had existed between Willoughby and Marianne seemed undeniable; and that Willoughby was tired of it was equally evident; for although Marianne might still cling to her own desires, she could not attribute such behavior to any kind of confusion or misunderstanding.</t2512> <t2513>Nothing but a complete change in the young man's feelings could explain it.</t2513> <t2514>Her indignation would have been even greater than she felt, had she not witnessed the turmoil that had overtaken him, which seemed to show that he was aware of his own misconduct and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been playing from the beginning with her sister's affection, with purposes that could not withstand the slightest scrutiny.</t2514> <t2515>Absence might have weakened his interest and for convenience he might have decided to put an end to it, but that such interest had existed, of that she could not doubt even if she tried.</t2515>
<t2516>As for Marianne, Elinor could not reflect without enormous concern on the painful blow that such an unfortunate encounter had already dealt her and on those even harsher ones she would receive from its probable consequences.</t2516> <t2517>Her own situation improved when she compared it to her sister's; for as long as she could esteem Edward as before, no matter how separated they might be in the future, her spirit could always have a support.</t2517> <t2518>But all the circumstances that made the pain received even more bitter seemed to conspire to increase Marianne's misery to the point of pushing her towards a decisive separation from Willoughby, to an immediate and irreconcilable break with him.</t2518>
<t2519>CHAPTER XXIX</t2519>
<t2520>The next day, before the maid had lit the fireplace or the sun had gained any dominance over a gray and cold January morning, Marianne, half-dressed, was kneeling in front of the stool by one of the windows, trying to make use of the little light she could steal and writing as fast as a continuous flow of tears would allow her.</t2520> <t2521>It was in that position that Elinor saw her upon waking, roused from her sleep by her sister's agitation and sobs; and after watching her for a few moments with silent anxiety, she said to her in a tone of the greatest consideration and sweetness:</t2521>
<t2522>—Marianne, can I ask you...?</t2522>
<t2523>—No, Elinor —he replied—, don't ask anything; you will soon know everything.</t2523>
<t2524>The kind of desperate calm with which she said this lasted no longer than her words, and was immediately replaced by a return to the same immense affliction.</t2524> <t2525>A few minutes passed before she could resume her letter, and the frequent bursts of pain that, at intervals, still forced her to pause her pen, were sufficient proof of her feeling that, almost certainly, this was the last time she would write to Willoughby.</t2525>
<t2526>Elinor gave her all the attention she could, silently and without disturbing her; and she would have tried to console and calm her even more if Marianne had not implored her, with the vehemence of the most nervous irritability, not to speak to her for anything in the world.</t2526> <t2527>Under such conditions, it was better for both not to stay together for long; and the anxiety that overwhelmed Marianne's mind not only prevented her from staying in the room for even a moment after getting dressed, but also, requiring both solitude and a continuous change of place, made her wander around the house until breakfast time, avoiding encountering anyone.</t2527>
<t2528>At breakfast, she did not eat anything nor did she try to; and Elinor then directed all her attention not to urging her, not to pitying her or seeming to observe her with concern, but to striving to draw all of Mrs. Jennings's interest towards herself.</t2528>
<t2529>This was Mrs. Jennings' favorite meal, so it lasted a considerable amount of time; and after finishing it, they had just begun to settle around the sewing table where they all worked, when a servant brought a letter for Marianne, which she snatched anxiously to run out of the room, her face deathly pale.</t2529> <t2530>Seeing this, Elinor, who knew with the same clarity as if she had seen the signs that it must be from Willoughby, immediately felt such compunction that she could barely keep her head up, and sat trembling in such a way that made her fear that Mrs. Jennings would necessarily notice.</t2530> <t2531>The good lady, however, only saw that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby, which she found very amusing and, reacting accordingly, laughed and expressed her hope that she would find it to her entire liking.</t2531> <t2532>As for Elinor's distress, Mrs. Jennings was too busy measuring yarn for her tapestry and noticed nothing; and continuing calmly with what she was saying, just as Marianne had disappeared, she added:</t2532>
<t2533>—By my faith, I have never seen a young woman so desperately in love!</t2533> <t2534>My girls do not compare, and they used to be quite foolish; but Miss Marianne seems like a completely disturbed creature.</t2534> <t2535>I hope, with all my heart, that he does not make her wait long, because it is pitiful to see her so sick and desolate.</t2535> <t2536>Tell me, when are they getting married?</t2536>
<t2537>Elinor, although she had never felt less inclined to speak than at that moment, forced herself to respond to such an offense, and thus, attempting to smile, replied:</t2537>
<t2538>—Really, ma'am, have you convinced yourself that my sister is engaged to Mr. Willoughby?</t2538> <t2539>I thought it was only a joke, but such a serious matter seems to imply something more: therefore, I beg you not to continue deceiving yourself.</t2539> <t2540>I can assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear that they were going to get married.</t2540>
<t2541>—What a shame, Miss Dashwood, what a shame!</t2541> <t2542>How can you say that!</t2542> <t2543>Don't we know that your union is secure... that you were madly in love from the first time you saw each other?</t2543> <t2544>Didn't I see you together in Devonshire every day, all day long?</t2544> <t2545>And do you think I didn't know that your sister came to town with me for the purpose of buying her wedding trousseau?</t2545> <t2546>Come on, come on; you won't achieve anything like this.</t2546> <t2547>You think that because you hide it so well, no one else notices anything; but that's not true, believe me, because everyone in town has known for a long time.</t2547> <t2548>I tell everyone, and so does Charlotte.</t2548>
<t2549>—Truly, madam —Elinor said to her with great seriousness—, you are mistaken.</t2549> <t2550>You are really doing something very unkind by spreading that news, and you will come to realize it, even though you do not believe me now.</t2550>
<t2551>Mrs. Jennings laughed again, and Elinor did not have the heart to say more, but anxious nonetheless to know what Willoughby had written, she hurried to her room where, upon opening the door, she found Marianne lying on the bed, almost suffocated with grief, with a letter in her hand and two or three more scattered around her.</t2551> <t2552>Elinor approached, but without saying a word; and sitting on the bed, she took one of her hands, kissed it affectionately several times, and then burst into sobs that were at first only slightly less violent than Marianne's.</t2552> <t2553>The latter, although unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of these gestures, and after a few moments of being thus united in their affliction, placed all the letters in Elinor's hands; and then, covering her face with a handkerchief, almost screamed in agony.</t2553> <t2554>Elinor, although she knew that such affliction, as terrible as it was to witness, had to run its course, stayed attentively by her side until these excesses of pain had somehow subsided; and then, anxiously taking Willoughby's letter, she read the following:</t2554>
<t2555>Bond Street, January</t2555>
<t2556>My dear lady,</t2556>
<t2557>I have just had the honor of receiving your letter, for which I beg you to accept my most sincere thanks.</t2557> <t2558>I am greatly concerned to know that something in my behavior last night did not meet with your approval; and although I feel incapable of discovering in what way I could have been so unfortunate as to offend you, I beg you to forgive me for what I can assure you was entirely unintentional.</t2558> <t2559>I will never remember my relationship with your family in Devonshire without the deepest pleasure and gratitude, and I would like to think that no mistake or misinterpretation of my actions will break it.</t2559> <t2560>I very sincerely esteem your entire family; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to the belief that my feelings were greater than they are or than I intended to express, I will greatly reproach myself for not having been more careful in the manifestations of that esteem.</t2560> <t2561>That I ever wanted to say more, you will accept that it is impossible when you know that my affections have been engaged elsewhere for a long time, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before this engagement is fulfilled.</t2561> <t2562>It is with great regret that I obey your order to return the letters with which you have honored me, and the lock of your hair that you so graciously granted me.</t2562>
<t2563>I remain, dear lady,</t2563>
<t2564>as your most obedient</t2564>
<t2565>and humble servant,</t2565>
<t2566>JOHN WILLOUGHBY</t2566><t2567>Y</t2567>
<t2568>You can imagine with what indignation Miss Dashwood read a letter like this.</t2568> <t2569>Although before reading it she was already aware that it must contain a confession of his inconstancy and confirm their definitive separation, she never imagined that such language could be used to announce it!</t2569> <t2570>Nor would she have supposed Willoughby capable of straying so far from the forms proper to an honorable and delicate sentiment... so far from the propriety of a gentleman as to send such a brazenly cruel letter: a letter that, instead of accompanying his desire to be free with some expression of remorse, did not acknowledge any breach of trust, denied that there had been any special affection..., a letter in which every line was an insult and proclaimed that its author was deeply sunk in the most callous vileness.</t2570>
<t2571>He dwelled on it for some time with indignant astonishment; then he read it again and again; but each rereading only served to increase his abhorrence for that man, and his feelings towards him were so bitter that he did not dare to allow himself to speak, for fear of deepening Marianne's wounds by presenting the end of her engagement not as a loss of some possible good for her, but as having escaped the worst and most irremediable of evils, a lifelong union with a man without principles; as a very true liberation, a very important blessing.</t2571>
<t2572>In her intense meditation on the content of the letter, on the depravity of the mind that could have dictated it, and, probably, on the very different nature of a very different person, who had no other relation to the matter than the one her heart assigned to her with everything that happened, Elinor forgot her sister's distress right there in front of her, forgot the three letters in her lap that she had not yet read, and so completely forgot the time she had been in the room, that when she heard a carriage arriving at the door and approached the window to see who was coming at such inappropriately early hours, she was utterly surprised to notice that it was Mrs. Jennings's carriage, which she knew had not been ordered until one o'clock.</t2572> <t2573>Determined not to leave Marianne, though without any hope of being able to contribute to her tranquility at that moment, she hurried out to apologize for not accompanying Mrs. Jennings, as her sister was feeling unwell.</t2573> <t2574>Mrs. Jennings, with cheerful concern for the reason of the excuse, accepted it with all ease, and Elinor, after bidding her farewell and seeing her leave without any problems, returned to Marianne; she found her trying to get out of bed and managed to reach her side just in time to prevent her from falling to the floor, weak and dazed from a prolonged lack of proper rest and nourishment, for there were many days she had spent without any appetite, and many nights since the last time she had truly slept; and now, when her mind was no longer sustained by the fever of suspense, the consequences of all this were seen in a headache, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous fragility.</t2574> <t2575>A glass of wine, which Elinor immediately brought her, restored her somewhat, and she was finally able to express part of her affection by saying:</t2575>
<t2576>—Poor Elinor!</t2576> <t2577>How much sorrow I cause you!</t2577>
<t2578>—I only wish —replied her sister— that there was something I could do to comfort you.</t2578>
<t2579>This, just as it would have happened with anything else, was too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim with all the anguish of her heart, "Oh, Elinor, how miserable I feel," before sobs completely choked her voice.</t2579>
<t2580>Elinor could no longer silently watch this torrent of grief that flowed without resistance.</t2580>
<t2581>—Make an effort, Marianne —he exclaimed—, or you will kill yourself and, along with you, all those who love you.</t2581> <t2582>Think of your mother; think of her grief upon knowing that you suffer; for her, you have to make an effort.</t2582>
<t2583>—I can't, I can't —exclaimed Marianne—; leave me, leave me if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me; but don't torture me like this.</t2583> <t2584>Oh! How easy it is for those who have no sorrows of their own to talk about effort!</t2584> <t2585>Happy, happy Elinor, you can't have any idea of what I suffer.</t2585>
<t2586>– You call me fortunate, Marianne! Ah! If only you knew!</t2586> <t2587>And how do you think I could be, seeing you so miserable!</t2587>
<t2588>—Forgive me, forgive me —throwing her arms around his neck—; I know you pity me; I know what a good heart you have; but even so you are... you must be happy; Edward loves you... What, tell me, what could kill a happiness like that?</t2588>
<t2589>—Many, many circumstances —said Elinor solemnly.</t2589>
<t2590>—No, no, no —exclaimed Marianne with a fervent voice—; he loves you, you and no one else but you.</t2590> <t2591>You cannot have any sorrow.</t2591>
<t2592>—I can't enjoy anything while I see you in such a state.</t2592>
<t2593>—And you will never see me in another form again.</t2593> <t2594>Mine is a misfortune that nothing can end.</t2594>
<t2595>—You must not speak like that, Marianne.</t2595> <t2596>Do you have no solace at all?</t2596> <t2597>Do you have no friends?</t2597> <t2598>Is your loss so great that it leaves no room for comfort?</t2598> <t2599>No matter how much you suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed until later... if your engagement had been prolonged for months and months, as could have happened, before he had decided to end it.</t2599> <t2600>With each new day of unfortunate trust on your part, the blow would have become more atrocious.</t2600>
<t2601>—Commitment! —exclaimed Marianne—.</t2601> <t2602>There has been no commitment.</t2602>
<t2603>—No commitments!</t2603>
<t2604>—No, it is not as dishonorable as you think.</t2604> <t2605>He has not deceived me.</t2605>
<t2606>—But he told you that he loved you, didn't he?</t2606>
<t2607>—Yes... no... never... absolutely not.</t2607> <t2608>It was always implied, but never openly stated.</t2608> <t2609>Sometimes I thought I had done it... but it never happened.</t2609>
<t2610>—And you still wrote to him?</t2610>
<t2611>—Yes... could he be wrong after everything that had happened?</t2611> <t2612>But I can't talk anymore.</t2612>
<t2613>Elinor remained silent, and turning her attention to the three letters that now aroused much more curiosity than before, she immediately set about examining the contents of all of them.</t2613> <t2614>The first, which was sent by her sister when they arrived in the city, was as follows:</t2614>
<t2615>Berkeley Street, January.</t2615>
<t2616>What a great surprise you will have, Willoughby, upon receiving this!</t2616> <t2617>And I think you will feel something more than surprise when you know that I am in the city.</t2617> <t2618>The opportunity to come here, even with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation I could not resist.</t2618> <t2619>I hope you receive this in time to come see me tonight, but I will not count on it.</t2619> <t2620>In any case, I will wait for you tomorrow.</t2620> <t2621>For now, adieu.</t2621>
<t2622>M. D.</t2622>
<t2623>The second note, written the morning after the ball at the Middletons', went as follows:</t2623>
<t2624>I cannot express my disappointment at not having been here when you came yesterday, nor my astonishment at not having received any response to the note I sent you about a week ago.</t2624> <t2625>I have been waiting to hear from you and, even more, to see you, every moment of the day.</t2625> <t2626>I beg you to come again as soon as you can and explain to me the reason for having kept me waiting in vain.</t2626> <t2627>It would be better if you came earlier next time, because we generally go out around one o'clock.</t2627> <t2628>Last night we were at Lady Middleton's, who hosted a dance.</t2628> <t2629>I was told that you had been invited.</t2629> <t2630>But, is it possible that this is true?</t2630> <t2631>You must have changed a lot since we parted if this happened and you did not attend.</t2631> <t2632>But I am not willing to believe that it was so, and I hope that very soon you will personally assure me that it was not.</t2632>
<t2633>M. D.</t2633>
<t2634>The content of the last note was this:</t2634>
<t2635>What am I to imagine, Willoughby, from your behavior last night?</t2635> <t2636>Once again, I demand an explanation.</t2636> <t2637>I had prepared myself to meet you with the natural joy that would have followed our separation, with the familiarity that our intimacy at Barton seemed to justify.</t2637> <t2638>And how I was disdained!</t2638> <t2639>I have spent a miserable night trying to excuse conduct that can hardly be considered anything less than insulting; but although I have yet to find any reasonable justification for your behavior, I am perfectly willing to hear it from you.</t2639> <t2640>Perhaps you have been misinformed, or deliberately deceived about something concerning me that might have degraded me in your opinion.</t2640> <t2641>Tell me what it is, explain on what grounds you acted, and I will be satisfied if I can satisfy you.</t2641> <t2642>It would certainly grieve me to have to think ill of you; but if I am forced to do so, if I am to find that you are not as we have believed you to be, that your consideration for all of us was not sincere and the sole purpose of your behavior towards me was deceit, it is better to know it as soon as possible.</t2642> <t2643>At this moment, I am filled with the most dreadful indecision; I wish to absolve you, but having certainty, in any direction, will alleviate my current suffering.</t2643> <t2644>If your feelings are no longer what they were, you will return my letters and the lock of my hair that you have in your possession.</t2644>
<t2645>M. D.</t2645>
<t2646>In consideration of Willoughby, Elinor would not have been willing to believe that such letters, so full of affection and trust, could have deserved the response they received.</t2646> <t2647>But her condemnation of his actions did not prevent her from seeing the ultimate inappropriateness of their having been written; and she inwardly regretted the imprudence that had risked such unsolicited proofs of tenderness, which no precedent justified and which the facts so severely condemned, when Marianne, noticing that she had finished with the letters, remarked that they contained nothing but what anyone in the same situation would have written.</t2647>
<t2648>—I felt —she added— as solemnly committed to him as if we were bound by the strictest legal pact.</t2648>
<t2649>—I can believe it —said Elinor—; but, unfortunately, he did not feel the same.</t2649>
<t2650>—He did feel the same, Elinor... week after week he felt it.</t2650> <t2651>I know it was so.</t2651> <t2652>No matter what has made him change now (and nothing but the blackest arts used against me could have achieved it), once I was as dear to him as my deepest desires could wish.</t2652> <t2653>This lock of hair, which he now discards so easily, he obtained after begging me for it in the most vehement manner.</t2653> <t2654>If you had seen his appearance, his manners, if you had heard his voice at that moment!</t2654> <t2655>Have you perhaps forgotten the last evening we spent together in Barton?</t2655> <t2656>Also the morning we parted!</t2656> <t2657>When he told me that many weeks might pass before we met again... his anguish, how could I forget his anguish!</t2657>
<t2658>For one or two moments, he couldn't say anything more; but when his emotion had subsided, he added in a firmer voice:</t2658>
<t2659>—Elinor, I have been used in the most cruel way, but it was not Willoughby who did it.</t2659>
<t2660>—My dear Marianne, who else but him?</t2660> <t2661>Who could have induced him to do it?</t2661>
<t2662>—Everyone, more than his own heart.</t2662> <t2663>Before I would believe that all the beings I know would conspire to degrade me in his eyes than believe him naturally capable of such cruelty.</t2663> <t2664>This woman he writes about, whoever she may be; or anyone, in short, except you, my dear sister, and mom and Edward, could have been heartless enough to denigrate me.</t2664> <t2665>Outside of you three, is there any creature in the world I would suspect less than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?</t2665>
<t2666>Elinor did not want to argue and simply replied:</t2666>
<t2667>—Whoever that detestable enemy of yours might have been, let us snatch away their wicked triumph, my dear sister, by showing them how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions sustains your spirit.</t2667> <t2668>A pride that rises against such malevolence is reasonable and worthy of praise.</t2668>
<t2669>—No, no —exclaimed Marianne—, a misfortune like mine does not know pride.</t2669> <t2670>I don't care if they know how miserable I feel.</t2670> <t2671>Everyone can savor the triumph of seeing me like this.</t2671> <t2672>Elinor, Elinor, those who suffer little can be as proud and independent as they want; They can resist insults or humiliate in turn...</t2672> <t2673>But I cannot.</t2673> <t2674>I have to feel, I have to be miserable... and they are welcome to enjoy knowing me like this.</t2674>
<t2675>—But for my mother, and for me.,,</t2675>
<t2676>—I would do more than for myself.</t2676> <t2677>But to show myself happy when I feel so miserable... Ah! Who could ask so much of me?</t2677>
<t2678>Both were silent again.</t2678> <t2679>Elinor was absorbed in walking thoughtfully from the fireplace to the window, from the window to the fireplace, without noticing the heat coming from one or distinguishing the objects through the other; and Marianne, sitting at the foot of the bed with her head resting against one of its posts, took Willoughby's letter again, and after shuddering at each of its sentences, exclaimed:</t2679>
<t2680>—It's too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, how can this come from you! Cruel, cruel, nothing can absolve you.</t2680> <t2681>Nothing, Elinor.</t2681> <t2682>Whatever it is that you may have heard against me... shouldn't you have suspended judgment?</t2682> <t2683>Shouldn't you have told me, given me the opportunity to justify myself?</t2683> <t2684>“The lock of her hair —repeating what the letter said— that she so graciously granted me”... that is unforgivable.</t2684> <t2685>Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words?</t2685> <t2686>Oh, what heartless insolence!</t2686> <t2687>Elinor, can she possibly be justified?</t2687>
<t2688>—No, Marianne, no way.</t2688>
<t2689>—And yet, this woman...</t2689> <t2690>who knows what her wicked schemes might have been, how long she might have premeditated, how she might have contrived!</t2690> <t2691>Who is she?</t2691> <t2692>Who can she be? Whom among his acquaintances did Willoughby ever mention as young and attractive?</t2692> <t2693>Oh!</t2693> <t2694>No one, no one... he only ever spoke to me about me.</t2694>
<t2695>Another pause followed; Marianne, seized by great agitation, concluded thus:</t2695>
<t2696>—Elinor, I must go home.</t2696> <t2697>I must go and console mother.</t2697> <t2698>Can we leave tomorrow?</t2698>
<t2699>—Tomorrow, Marianne!</t2699>
<t2700>—Yes; why should I stay here?</t2700> <t2701>I came only for Willoughby... and now, who cares about me?</t2701> <t2702>Who is interested in me?</t2702>
<t2703>—It would be impossible to leave tomorrow.</t2703> <t2704>We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than courtesy; and the most basic courtesy would not allow such a sudden departure as that.</t2704>
<t2705>—All right, then, in one or two more days perhaps; but I can't stay here much longer, I can't stay and endure the questions and remarks from all those people.</t2705> <t2706>The Middletons, the Palmers... how am I going to bear their compassion?</t2706> <t2707>The compassion of a woman like Mrs. Jennings! Ah, what would he say about that!</t2707>
<t2708>Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a few moments she did so; but no position calmed her, and in a painful restlessness of mind and body, she shifted from one posture to another, becoming more agitated each time; her sister could barely keep her in bed and for a few moments feared she would have to ask for help.</t2708> <t2709>A few drops of lavender, however, which she managed to persuade her to take, provided some relief; and from that moment until Mrs. Jennings returned, she remained in bed, silent and still.</t2709>
<t2710>CHAPTER XXX</t2710>
<t2711>Upon her return, Mrs. Jennings went directly to Elinor and Marianne's room and, without waiting for them to respond to her call, opened the door and entered with an air of genuine concern.</t2711>
<t2712>—How are you, dear? —he asked Marianne in a compassionate tone, who turned her face away without making any attempt to respond.</t2712>
<t2713>—How are you, Miss Dashwood? Poor thing!</t2713> <t2714>You look very bad.</t2714> <t2715>It's not surprising.</t2715> <t2716>Yes, unfortunately it's true.</t2716> <t2717>She is going to get married soon... he's a scoundrel!</t2717> <t2718>I can't stand him.</t2718> <t2719>Mrs. Taylor told me half an hour ago, and she heard it from a close friend of Miss Grey herself, otherwise I wouldn't have believed it; I was astounded to hear it.</t2719> <t2720>Well, I said, all I can say is that, if it's true, he has behaved abominably towards a young woman I know, and I wholeheartedly wish that his wife torments him for the rest of his life.</t2720> <t2721>And I will keep saying it forever, dear, you can be sure of that.</t2721> <t2722>I can't imagine where men will end up if they continue down this path; and if I ever meet him again, I will give him such a reprimand as he has rarely had in his life.</t2722> <t2723>But there is one consolation, my dear Miss Marianne: he is not the only young man in the world worth your time; and with your pretty face, you will never lack admirers.</t2723> <t2724>Poor thing!</t2724> <t2725>I won't bother you anymore, because the best thing would be for you to cry out your sorrows once and for all and get it over with.</t2725> <t2726>Fortunately, you know, the Parrys and the Sandersons are coming tonight, and that will cheer you up.</t2726>
<t2727>She then left the room walking on tiptoe, as if she believed that the distress of her young friend might increase with the noise.</t2727>
<t2728>To her sister's surprise, Marianne decided to dine with them.</t2728> <t2729>Elinor even advised her against it.</t2729> <t2730>But, "no, she was going to come down; she would bear it perfectly well, and the commotion around her would be less."</t2730> <t2731>Elinor, pleased that for the moment this was the reason guiding her and although she did not believe she was capable of sitting down to dinner, said nothing more; thus, adjusting her dress as best she could while Marianne remained lying on the bed, she was ready to accompany her to the dining room as soon as they were called.</t2731>
<t2732>Once there, although with a very unhappy air, he ate more and with greater tranquility than his sister had expected.</t2732> <t2733>If he had tried to speak or had realized half of the well-intentioned but misguided attentions that Mrs. Jennings directed at him, he would not have been able to maintain that calm; but his lips did not let out a single syllable and his absorption kept him in the greatest ignorance of what was happening in front of him.</t2733>
<t2734>Elinor, who valued Mrs. Jennings' kindness although the effusiveness with which she expressed it was often irritating and at times almost ridiculous, expressed her gratitude and reciprocated the courtesies that her sister was incapable of expressing or performing herself.</t2734><t2735>Her good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that everything that could lessen her sorrow was owed to her.</t2735><t2736>She treated her, then, with all the affectionate indulgence of a mother towards her favorite child on their last day of vacation.</t2736><t2737>Marianne was to be given the best spot by the fireplace, tempted with all the best delicacies of the house, and entertained with the recounting of all the day's news.</t2737><t2738>If Elinor had not seen in her sister's sad countenance a restraint on all rejoicing, she would have enjoyed Mrs. Jennings' efforts to cure a heartbreak with a whole variety of sweets and olives and a good fireplace.</t2738><t2739>However, as soon as the awareness of all this dawned on Marianne by being repeated over and over, she could no longer stay there.</t2739><t2740>With a vivid exclamation of pain and a signal to her sister not to follow her, she got up and hurried out of the room.</t2740>
<t2741>“Poor creature!” exclaimed Mrs. Jennings as soon as she had left.</t2741> <t2742>“How it pains me to see her!”</t2742> <t2743>“And look, she left without finishing her wine!”</t2743> <t2744>“And she also left the candied cherries!”</t2744> <t2745>“My God!”</t2745> <t2746>“Nothing seems to please her.”</t2746> <t2747>“Believe me, if I knew of something she would like, I would send someone to search the whole city until they found it.”</t2747> <t2748>“Well, it’s the most incredible thing that a man has treated such a lovely girl so badly!”</t2748> <t2749>“But when money is abundant on one side and completely scarce on the other, God help me, such things no longer matter to them.”</t2749>
<t2750>—So, the lady in question, Miss Grey I believe you called her, is she very wealthy?</t2750>
<t2751>—Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.</t2751> <t2752>Have you ever seen her?</t2752> <t2753>An elegant girl, very fashionable, they say, but not at all pretty.</t2753> <t2754>I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very rich man.</t2754> <t2755>But everyone in the family is rich.</t2755> <t2756>Fifty thousand pounds!</t2756> <t2757>And from every point of view, they are going to arrive just in time, because they say he is ruined.</t2757> <t2758>Well, of course, always showing off with his carriage and his horses and hunting dogs!</t2758> <t2759>Come on, without judging, but when a young man, whoever he is, comes and woos a pretty girl and promises her marriage, he has no right to go back on his word just because he has become poor and a rich girl is willing to accept him.</t2759> <t2760>Why, in that case, doesn't he sell his horses, rent out his house, dismiss his servants, and make a real change in his life?</t2760> <t2761>I assure you that Miss Marianne would have been willing to wait until things were sorted out.</t2761> <t2762>But that's not how things are done nowadays; young people today will never give up any pleasure.</t2762>
<t2763>—Do you know what kind of girl Miss Grey is?</t2763> <t2764>Does she have a reputation for being kind?</t2764>
<t2765>—I have never heard anything bad about her; in fact, I have almost never heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning that one day Miss Walker hinted to her that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not regret seeing Miss Grey married, because she and Mrs. Ellison had never gotten along.</t2765>
<t2766>—And who are the Ellisons?</t2766>
<t2767>—Her guardians, dear.</t2767> <t2768>But she is of age now and can choose for herself; and what a lovely choice she has made!</t2768> <t2769>And now —after a brief pause—, her poor sister has gone to her room, I suppose, to lament alone.</t2769> <t2770>Is there nothing that can be done to console her?</t2770> <t2771>Poor thing, it seems so cruel to leave her alone.</t2771> <t2772>But well, little by little we will bring new friends, and that will amuse her a bit.</t2772> <t2773>What can we play?</t2773> <t2774>I know she detests whist; but, is there no round game that she likes?</t2774>
<t2775>—My dear lady, such kindness is completely unnecessary.</t2775> <t2776>I am sure that Marianne will not leave her room tonight.</t2776> <t2777>I will try to convince her, if I can, to go to bed early, because I am sure she needs to rest.</t2777>
<t2778>—Of course, that will be the best for her.</t2778> <t2779>Let her say what she wants to eat, and let her go to bed.</t2779> <t2780>God!</t2780> <t2781>It's no wonder she has been looking so bad and so downcast last week and the week before, because I imagine this thing has been weighing on her all that time.</t2781> <t2782>And the letter she received today was the last straw!</t2782> <t2783>Poor creature!</t2783> <t2784>If I had known, of course, I wouldn't have joked about it for all the gold in the world.</t2784> <t2785>But then, you know, how could I have guessed?</t2785> <t2786>I was sure it was just an ordinary love letter, and you know young people like it when you tease them a little about those things.</t2786> <t2787>God! How worried Sir John and my daughters will be when they find out!</t2787> <t2788>If I had been in my right mind, I could have passed by Conduit Street on my way home and told them.</t2788> <t2789>But I'll see them tomorrow.</t2789>
<t2790>—I am sure it will not be necessary to warn Mrs. Palmer and Sir John not to mention Mr. Willoughby or make the slightest allusion to what has happened in front of my sister.</t2790> <t2791>Their own natural kindness will indicate to them how cruel it is to show in her presence that they know something about it; and the less I am spoken to about the subject, the more suffering they will spare me, as you well know, my dear lady.</t2791>
<t2792>—Oh, God! Yes, of course.</t2792> <t2793>It must be terrible for you to hear the comments; and regarding your sister, I assure you that I won't mention a word about the matter to her for anything in the world.</t2793> <t2794>You saw that I didn't during dinner.</t2794> <t2795>And neither Sir John nor my daughters will, because they are very aware and considerate, especially if I suggest it, which I certainly will.</t2795> <t2796>For my part, I think the less said about these things, the better, and the faster they disappear and are forgotten.</t2796> <t2797>And when has anything good ever come from talking, right?</t2797>
<t2798>—In the current case, it can only cause harm... perhaps more than in many similar cases, because this one has been accompanied by some circumstances that, for the good of all those involved, make it inconvenient for it to become a matter of public comment.</t2798> <t2799>I have to acknowledge this about Mr. Willoughby: he has not broken any actual commitment with my sister.</t2799>
<t2800>—For God's sake, dear!</t2800> <t2801>Don't try to defend him.</t2801> <t2802>How can you talk to me about no real commitment after making her tour the entire house of Allenham and showing her the very rooms in which they were going to live from then on!</t2802>
<t2803>Thinking of her sister, Elinor did not want to continue with the subject, and also for Willoughby's sake, she hoped she would not be asked to do so, for although Marianne could lose much, there was little he could gain if the truth were upheld.</t2803> <t2804>After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings, with all her characteristic good humor, embarked on the subject again.</t2804>
<t2805>—Well, dear, as they say, nobody knows for whom they work, because the one who will come out winning from all this is Colonel Brandon.</t2805><t2806>In the end, he will have her; yes, of course, he will have her.</t2806><t2807>Mark my words, if they are not already married by the summer.</t2807><t2808>God! How the colonel will enjoy this news!</t2808><t2809>I hope he comes tonight.</t2809><t2810>I'd bet everything that it will be a much better match for her sister.</t2810><t2811>Two thousand a year without debts or burdens... except, of course, the young girl, his natural daughter; of course, I forgot about her, but without major expenses, they can place her as an apprentice somewhere, and then she won't matter at all.</t2811><t2812>Delaford is a very pleasant place, I assure you; exactly what I call a pleasant old-fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; surrounded by a huge orchard with the best fruit trees in the whole region, and what a mulberry tree in one corner! God!</t2812><t2813>How we stuffed ourselves with Charlotte the only time we went!</t2813><t2814>Also, there is a dovecote, some excellent fish ponds for the table, and a lovely gutter; in short, everything one could wish for; and, moreover, it is near the church and only a quarter of a mile from a toll road, so it is never boring, as you just need to sit in an old gazebo under a yew tree behind the house and you can see the carriages go by.</t2814><t2815>Ah, it is a beautiful place!</t2815><t2816>A butcher nearby in the village and the parsonage within a stone's throw.</t2816><t2817>For my taste, a thousand times nicer than Barton Park, where you have to travel three miles to get meat and there are no neighbors closer than your mother.</t2817><t2818>Well, I will encourage the colonel as soon as I can.</t2818><t2819>You know, one nail drives out another.</t2819><t2820>If only we could get Willoughby out of her mind!</t2820>
<t2821>—Oh, if we could at least do that, ma'am —said Elinor—, we would manage just fine with or without Colonel Brandon.</t2821>
<t2822>Rising, then, he went to meet Marianne, whom he found, as he had expected, in her room, bent in silent despair over the remnants of the fire in the fireplace, which until Elinor's entrance had been her only light.</t2822>
<t2823>—You better leave me alone —was all the attention she gave to her sister.</t2823>
<t2824>—I will do it —said Elinor—, if you go to bed.</t2824>
<t2825>To this, however, with the momentary obstinacy of a fervent suffering, she initially refused.</t2825> <t2826>But the insistent, though gentle, arguments of her sister soon gently led her to docility; and before leaving her, Elinor saw her rest her aching head on the pillow and, as she expected, on the way to a certain tranquility.</t2826>
<t2827>In the room, where she then went, Mrs. Jennings soon joined her with a glass of wine, filled with something, in her hand.</t2827>
<t2828>—Dear —he said upon entering—, I just remembered that here at home I have some of the best aged Constantia wine I've ever tasted, so I brought a glass for your sister.</t2828> <t2829>My poor husband!</t2829> <t2830>How he loved it!</t2830> <t2831>Every time he had one of his hepatic gout attacks, he would say that nothing in the world made him feel better.</t2831> <t2832>Please, take it to your sister.</t2832>
<t2833>—My dear lady —replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the ailments for which it was recommended—, how kind you are!</t2833> <t2834>But I have just left Marianne lying down and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I believe that nothing will serve her better than rest, if you permit me, I will drink the wine.</t2834>
<t2835>Mrs. Jennings, though regretting not having arrived five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the arrangement; and Elinor, while taking it, thought that although its effect on hepatic gout was of no importance at the moment, its healing powers on a disillusioned heart could well be tested on her as much as on her sister.</t2835>
<t2836>Colonel Brandon arrived while they were having tea, and by the way he looked around to see if Marianne was there, Elinor immediately imagined that he neither expected nor wished to see her there and, in short, that he already knew the reason for her absence.</t2836> <t2837>Mrs. Jennings did not think the same, for shortly after the colonel's arrival, she crossed the room to the tea table presided over by Elinor and whispered to her:</t2837>
<t2838>—Look, the colonel is as serious as ever.</t2838> <t2839>He doesn't know anything about what happened; come on, tell him, dear.</t2839>
<t2840>After a while, he brought a chair closer to Elinor's table, and with an air that made her feel certain he was fully informed, he asked her about her sister.</t2840>
<t2841>—Marianne is not feeling well —she said—.</t2841> <t2842>She has been unwell all day and we have convinced her to go to bed.</t2842>
<t2843>—Then, maybe —he responded hesitantly—, what I heard this morning might be true... it might be more true than I initially thought possible.</t2843>
<t2844>—What did you hear?</t2844>
<t2845>—That a gentleman, regarding whom I had reasons to think... in short, that a man who was known to be committed... but, how can I tell you?</t2845> <t2846>If you already know, as is most likely, you can spare me from having to do it.</t2846>
<t2847>—You are referring —Elinor responded with forced calmness— to Mr. Willoughby's marriage to Miss Grey.</t2847> <t2848>Yes, yes, we know all about it.</t2848> <t2849>This seems to have been a day of general enlightenment, because we only discovered it this very morning.</t2849> <t2850>Mr. Willoughby is incomprehensible!</t2850> <t2851>Where did you hear it?</t2851>
<t2852>—In a stationery shop in Pall Mall, where I had to go in the morning.</t2852> <t2853>Two ladies were waiting for their carriage and one was telling the other about this upcoming wedding, in such an indiscreet voice that it was impossible for me not to hear everything.</t2853> <t2854>The name Willoughby, John Willoughby, repeated over and over, first caught my attention, and this was followed by the unequivocal statement that everything was already decided regarding his marriage to Miss Grey; it was no longer a secret, the wedding would take place within a few weeks, and many other details about the preparations and other matters.</t2854> <t2855>I especially remember one thing, because it allowed me to identify the man more precisely: as soon as the ceremony was over, they would leave for Combe Magna, his property in Somersetshire.</t2855> <t2856>You cannot imagine my astonishment!</t2856> <t2857>But it would be impossible for me to describe what I felt.</t2857> <t2858>The very communicative lady, I was informed upon asking, because I stayed in the shop until they had left, was a certain Mrs. Ellison; and that, I have been told, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian.</t2858>
<t2859>—Yes, it is.</t2859> <t2860>But, did you also hear that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds?</t2860> <t2861>That might explain it, if anything can.</t2861>
<t2862>—It could be so; but Willoughby is capable... at least I think so —he paused for a moment, and then added in a voice that seemed to distrust itself—; and his sister, how has she...?</t2862>
<t2863>—Her suffering has been enormous.</t2863> <t2864>I can only hope that it will be proportionately brief.</t2864> <t2865>It has been, it is the most cruel affliction.</t2865> <t2866>Until yesterday, I believe, she never doubted Willoughby's affection; and even now, perhaps... but, for my part, I am almost certain that he was never truly interested in her.</t2866> <t2867>He has been so deceitful!</t2867> <t2868>And, in some things, there seems to be a certain cruelty in him.</t2868>
<t2869>—Ah! —said Colonel Brandon—, there certainly is.</t2869> <t2870>But your sister does not... I think I heard you say... does not think the same as you, does she?</t2870>
<t2871>—You know how she is, and you can imagine how she would justify it if she could.</t2871>
<t2872>He did not respond; and shortly after, as the tea service was removed and groups formed to play cards, they had to set the topic aside.</t2872> <t2873>Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them converse with great pleasure and expected to see how Miss Dashwood's words would produce in Colonel Brandon an instant joy, similar to that which would correspond to a man in the prime of youth, hope, and happiness, was filled with astonishment to see him remain more thoughtful and serious than ever throughout the afternoon.</t2873>
<t2874>CHAPTER XXXI</t2874>
<t2875>After a night in which she had slept more than expected, Marianne woke up the next morning to find herself feeling as miserable as when she had closed her eyes.</t2875>
<t2876>Elinor encouraged her as much as she could to talk about what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had gone over the matter again and again, Elinor without altering her calm certainty and affectionate advice, and Marianne maintaining the exacerbation of her emotions and changing her opinions over and over.</t2876> <t2877>At times she believed Willoughby to be as miserable and innocent as she was; and at others, she despaired at the impossibility of absolving him.</t2877> <t2878>In one moment the world's comments were absolutely indifferent to her, the next she would withdraw from it forever, and then she would resist it with all her strength.</t2878> <t2879>In one thing, however, she remained constant when dealing with this point: in avoiding, whenever possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in her decision to remain absolutely silent when she was forced to endure her.</t2879> <t2880>Her heart refused to believe that Mrs. Jennings could share in her pain with any compassion.</t2880>
<t2881>—No, no, it can't be —he exclaimed—, she is incapable of feeling.</t2881> <t2882>Her affability is not compassion; her good nature is not tenderness.</t2882> <t2883>All she cares about is gossiping, and she only likes me because I give her material for it.</t2883>
<t2884>Elinor did not need to hear this to know how many injustices her sister could commit, driven by the irritable refinement of her own mind when it came to forming opinions about others, and the excessive importance she attributed to the delicacies of great sensitivity and the grace of cultivated manners.</t2884> <t2885>Like half the world, if more than half the world were intelligent and good, Marianne, with her excellent qualities and excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor just.</t2885> <t2886>She expected others to have her same opinions and feelings, and judged their motives by the immediate effect their actions had on her.</t2886> <t2887>It was under these circumstances that, while the sisters were in their room after breakfast, something happened that further lowered her opinion of Mrs. Jennings' quality of feelings; for, due to her own weakness, she allowed it to cause her new pain, although the good lady had been guided by the best intentions.</t2887>
<t2888>With a letter in her outstretched hand and a cheerful smile born from the conviction of being a bearer of comfort, she entered the room saying:</t2888>
<t2889>—Look, dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good.</t2889>
<t2890>Marianne did not need to listen any further.</t2890> <t2891>In an instant, her imagination presented her with a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and repentance, explaining everything to her complete satisfaction and in a convincing manner, immediately followed by Willoughby himself, rushing into the room to reinforce, at her feet and with the eloquence of his gaze, the declarations of his letter.</t2891> <t2892>The work of a moment was destroyed by the next.</t2892> <t2893>Before her was her mother's handwriting, which until then had never been ill-received; and in the sharpness of her disappointment after an ecstasy that had been more than hope, she felt as if, until that moment, she had never suffered.</t2893>
<t2894>She had no name for Mrs. Jennings' cruelty, although she certainly would have known how to name it in her moments of happiest eloquence; now she could only reproach her through the tears that flooded her eyes with passionate violence; a reproach, however, so completely wasted on the one to whom it was directed, that she, after many expressions of compassion, withdrew without ceasing to commend the letter to her as a great comfort.</t2894> <t2895>But when she had enough tranquility to read it, little relief did she find in it.</t2895> <t2896>Every line was full of Willoughby.</t2896> <t2897>Mrs. Dashwood, still confident in his commitment and believing with her usual warmth in the young man's loyalty, had only decided, at Elinor's insistence, to demand greater frankness from Marianne towards both of them, and this with such tenderness towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such certainty about the happiness each would find in the other, that she could not help but cry desperately until she finished reading.</t2897>
<t2898>Once again, all of Marianne's impatience to return home was awakened; never had her mother been dearer to her, even due to the very excess of her mistaken trust in Willoughby, and she desperately longed to have already departed.</t2898> <t2899>Elinor, unable to decide for herself what would be better for Marianne, whether to be in London or in Barton, offered her no other consolation than the recommendation of patience until they knew their mother's wishes; and she finally managed to get her sister to agree to wait until they knew.</t2899>
<t2900>Mrs. Jennings left earlier than usual, as she could not remain calm until the Middletons and the Palmers could lament as much as she did; and firmly refusing Elinor's offer to accompany her, she went out alone for the rest of the morning.</t2900> <t2901>Elinor, with a heavy heart, aware of the pain she was about to cause and realizing from the letter to Marianne how little success she had had in preparing her mother, sat down to write to her, recounting what had happened and asking her to guide them on what they should do next.</t2901> <t2902>Marianne, meanwhile, who had come to the room when Mrs. Jennings left, remained motionless by the table where Elinor was writing, watching her pen move, lamenting the harshness of her task, and lamenting even more affectionately the effect it would have on their mother.</t2902>
<t2903>They had been at this for about a quarter of an hour when Marianne, whose nerves could not bear any sudden noise at that moment, was startled by a knock on the door.</t2903>
<t2904>—Who can it be? —exclaimed Elinor—.</t2904> <t2905>And so early!</t2905> <t2906>I thought we were safe.</t2906>
<t2907>Marianne approached the window.</t2907>
<t2908>—It's Colonel Brandon —she said, annoyed—.</t2908> <t2909>We are never safe from him.</t2909>
<t2910>—Since Mrs. Jennings is out, she will not come in.</t2910>
<t2911>—I wouldn't trust that —retreating to his room—.</t2911> <t2912>A man who doesn't know what to do with his time has no awareness of his intrusion into others' time.</t2912>
<t2913>The facts confirmed her assumption, even though it was based on injustice and error, because Colonel Brandon did indeed come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that his concern for Marianne had brought him there, and who saw that concern in his sad and troubled demeanor and in his anxious, albeit brief, inquiry about her, could not forgive her sister for judging him so lightly.</t2913>
<t2914>—I met Mrs. Jennings on Bond Street —he told her, after the initial greeting—, and she encouraged me to come; and it wasn't difficult for her to do so, because I thought it likely to find you alone, which was what I wanted.</t2914> <t2915>My purpose... my desire, my only desire in wanting that... I hope, I believe it is so... is to be able to offer comfort... no, I must not say comfort, not momentary comfort, but a certainty, an enduring certainty for your sister.</t2915> <t2916>My consideration for her, for you, for your mother, I hope allows me to prove it to you through the account of certain circumstances, which nothing but a very sincere consideration, nothing but the desire to be of use to you... I believe justifies.</t2916> <t2917>Although, if I have had to spend so many hours trying to convince myself that I am right, is there not reason to fear being wrong? —he interrupted himself.</t2917>
<t2918>—I understand —said Elinor—.</t2918> <t2919>You have something to tell me about Mr. Willoughby that will further reveal his character.</t2919> <t2920>Saying it will be the greatest sign of friendship you can show towards Marianne.</t2920> <t2921>Any information aimed at that end will earn my immediate gratitude, and hers will come in time.</t2921> <t2922>Please, I beg you, tell me.</t2922>
<t2923>—I will do it; and, to be brief, when I left Barton last October... but you won't understand it that way.</t2923> <t2924>I must go back even further.</t2924> <t2925>You will realize that I am a very clumsy narrator, Miss Dashwood; I don't even know where to begin.</t2925> <t2926>I think it will be necessary to tell you very briefly about myself, and I will be very brief.</t2926> <t2927>On a subject like this —he sighed deeply— I will be little tempted to go on at length.</t2927>
<t2928>He paused for a moment to organize his memories and then, with another sigh, continued.</t2928>
<t2929>—You have probably completely forgotten a conversation (it was not supposed to make any impression on you), a conversation we had one night at Barton Park, a night when there was a dance, in which I mentioned a lady I had known a long time ago who somewhat resembled your sister Marianne.</t2929>
<t2930>—By the way —replied Elinor—, I have not forgotten it.</t2930>
<t2931>The colonel seemed pleased by this memory, and added:</t2931>
<t2932>—If uncertainty does not deceive me, the arbitrariness of a sweet memory, there is a great resemblance between them, in mentality and appearance: the same intensity in their feelings, the same strength of imagination and vehemence of spirit.</t2932><t2933>This lady was one of my closest relatives, orphaned since childhood and under my father's guardianship.</t2933><t2934>We were almost the same age, and from our earliest years, we were playmates and friends.</t2934><t2935>I cannot remember a time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such that perhaps, judging by my current solitary character and my so little cheerful seriousness, you might believe me incapable of having felt it.</t2935><t2936>Her affection for me was, I believe, as fervent as her sister's for Mr. Willoughby and, although for different reasons, no less unfortunate.</t2936><t2937>At seventeen, I lost her forever.</t2937><t2938>She married, against her wishes, my brother.</t2938><t2939>She possessed a great fortune, and my family's properties were quite significant.</t2939><t2940>And this, I fear, is all that can be said regarding the behavior of someone who was at the same time her uncle and guardian.</t2940><t2941>My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her.</t2941><t2942>I had hoped that her affection for me would sustain her through all difficulties, and for a time it did; but finally, the unfortunate situation she lived in, because she had to endure the greatest hardships, was stronger than her, and although she had promised me that nothing... but how blindly I advance in my story!</t2942><t2943>I have not told you how this came to be.</t2943><t2944>We were a few hours away from fleeing together to Scotland.</t2944><t2945>The falseness, or the foolishness of my cousin's maid betrayed us.</t2945><t2946>I was expelled to the house of a very distant relative, and she was allowed no freedom, no company, nor any amusement, until they convinced my father to give in.</t2946><t2947>I had trusted too much in Eliza's strength, and the blow was very severe.</t2947><t2948>But if her marriage had been happy, young as I was then, in a few months I would have come to accept it, or at least I would not have to lament it now.</t2948><t2949>But that was not the case.</t2949><t2950>My brother had no consideration for her; his amusements were not the right ones, and from the beginning, he treated her harshly.</t2950><t2951>The consequence of this on a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was only to be expected.</t2951><t2952>At first, she resigned herself to the misery of her situation; and she would have been happy if she had not dedicated her life to overcoming the sorrow caused by my memory.</t2952><t2953>But, can we be surprised that with such a husband, who pushed her towards infidelity, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father only lived a few months more after they married, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies), she fell?</t2953><t2954>If I had stayed in England, perhaps... but my intention was to seek the happiness of both by staying away from her for a few years, and with that purpose, I had obtained my transfer.</t2954><t2955>The blow that her marriage meant to me —he continued with an agitated voice— was nothing, it was something trivial, compared to what I felt when, more or less two years later, I learned of her divorce.</t2955><t2956>That was the cause of this melancholy... even now, the memory of what I suffered...</t2956>
<t2957>Unable to continue speaking, he stood up abruptly and began pacing around the room for a few minutes.</t2957> <t2958>Elinor, affected by his story, and even more by his distress, also couldn't say a word.</t2958> <t2959>He saw her sorrow and, approaching her, took one of her hands in his, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect.</t2959> <t2960>A few more minutes of silent effort allowed him to continue with a certain composure.</t2960>
<t2961>—About three years passed after this unfortunate period before I returned to England.</t2961> <t2962>My first concern when I arrived, of course, was to look for her.</t2962> <t2963>But the search was as fruitless as it was sad.</t2963> <t2964>I could not trace her steps beyond the first man who seduced her, and everything suggested that she had left him only to sink deeper into a life of sin.</t2964> <t2965>Her legal allowance did not match her fortune nor was it enough to subsist with any well-being, and I learned from my brother that some months ago she had given someone else the power to receive it.</t2965> <t2966>He imagined, and could easily imagine, that extravagance and the consequent distress had forced her to dispose of her money to solve some urgent problem.</t2966> <t2967>Finally, however, and when six months had passed since my arrival in England, I was able to find her.</t2967> <t2968>The interest in a former servant who, after leaving my service, had fallen into disgrace, led me to visit him in a place of detention where he had been confined for debts; and there, in the same place, in the same confinement, was my unfortunate sister.</t2968> <t2969>So changed, so faded, worn out by all kinds of sufferings!</t2969> <t2970>I could hardly believe that the sad and sickly figure before me was what remained of the adorable, flourishing, healthy girl I had once been enamored of.</t2970> <t2971>How much pain I had to endure seeing her like this... but I have no right to hurt her feelings by trying to describe it.</t2971> <t2972>I have already made her suffer too much.</t2972> <t2973>That, by all appearances, she was in the final stages of tuberculosis was... yes, in such a situation it was my greatest consolation.</t2973> <t2974>Life could no longer do anything for her, beyond giving her time to better prepare to die; and that was granted to her.</t2974> <t2975>I made sure she had comfortable accommodation and the necessary care; I visited her daily for the rest of her short life: I was by her side in her final moments.</t2975>
<t2976>Again he stopped, trying to recover himself; and Elinor gave vent to her feelings through a tender exclamation of sorrow for the fate of her unfortunate friend.</t2976>
<t2977>—I hope your sister will not be offended —he said— by the resemblance I have imagined between her and my poor unfortunate relative.</t2977> <t2978>Their fate, and the fortune that befell them, cannot be the same; and if the sweet natural disposition of one had been watched over by someone firmer, or had she had a happier marriage, she would have become everything you will see the other will be.</t2978> <t2979>But, where does all this lead us?</t2979> <t2980>I believe I have distressed you for nothing.</t2980> <t2981>Ah, Miss Dashwood!</t2981> <t2982>A subject like this, silenced for fourteen years... it is dangerous even to touch it!</t2982> <t2983>I must concentrate... be more concise.</t2983> <t2984>Eti7a left her only daughter in my care, a little girl then three years old, the fruit of her first guilty relationship.</t2984> <t2985>She loved that child, and had always kept her by her side.</t2985> <t2986>It was her most valuable and precious treasure that she entrusted to me, and I would gladly have taken charge of her in the strictest sense, personally overseeing her education, if our situations had permitted; but I had neither family nor home; and so my little Eliza was sent to a boarding school.</t2986> <t2987>I went to see her there whenever I could, and after my brother's death (which occurred around five years ago, leaving me in possession of the family estate), she visited me quite frequently at Delaford.</t2987> <t2988>I called her a distant relative, but I am very aware that it has generally been supposed that the relationship is much closer.</t2988> <t2989>Three years ago (she had just turned fourteen) I took her out of school and placed her in the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had charge of four or five other girls of about the same age; and for two years, everything made me feel very satisfied with her situation.</t2989> <t2990>But last February, almost a year ago, she suddenly disappeared.</t2990> <t2991>I had authorized her (imprudently, as it has since turned out), yielding to her ardent wishes, to go to Bath with one of her little friends, whose father was there for health reasons.</t2991> <t2992>I knew his reputation as a very good man, and had a good opinion of his daughter... better than she deserved, for she, obstinately maintaining the most foolish secrecy, refused to say anything, to give any clue, although she was obviously aware of everything.</t2992> <t2993>I believe that he, her father, a well-meaning but not very perceptive man, was really incapable of giving any information, for he had been almost always confined to the house, while the girls roamed the city forming relationships with whomever they pleased; and he tried to convince me, as much as he was convinced himself, that his daughter had nothing to do with the matter.</t2993> <t2994>In short, I could find out nothing except that she had gone; for eight long months, everything else remained mere conjecture.</t2994> <t2995>It is imaginable what I thought, what I feared, and also what I suffered.</t2995>
<t2996>—Good heavens! —exclaimed Elinor—.</t2996> <t2997>Could it be possible! Could it be that Willoughby...!</t2997>
<t2998>—The first news I had of her —continued the colonel— reached me in a letter she herself sent me last October.</t2998> <t2999>It was forwarded to me from Delaford and I received it that very morning when we were planning to go on an excursion to Whitwell; and that was the reason for my sudden departure from Barton, which surely must have puzzled everyone at the time and, I believe, offended some.</t2999> <t3000>Little could Mr. Willoughby imagine, it seems to me, when he reproached me with his look for the discourtesy I had committed by ruining the outing, that I was being called upon to assist someone whom he had brought misery and unhappiness to; but even if he had known, what good would it have done?</t3000> <t3001>Would he have been less cheerful or less happy with his sister’s smiles?</t3001> <t3002>No, he had already done what no man capable of any compassion would do.</t3002> <t3003>He had abandoned the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced, leaving her in a situation of utmost distress, without a respectable home, without help, without friends, not knowing where to find him!</t3003> <t3004>He had abandoned her, with the promise to return; he neither wrote, nor returned, nor helped her.</t3004>
<t3005>—How inconceivable! —exclaimed Elinor.</t3005>
<t3006>—Now you can see what his character is like: wasteful, licentious, and worse than that.</t3006> <t3007>Knowing this, as I have known for many weeks now, imagine what I must have felt seeing your sister so attached to him as always, and when I was assured that she was going to marry him; imagine what I must have felt thinking about all of you.</t3007> <t3008>When I came to see you last week and found you alone, I was determined to know the truth, although still undecided about what to do once I knew it.</t3008> <t3009>My behavior must have seemed strange to you, but now you will understand.</t3009> <t3010>To see all of you deceived in this way; to see your sister... but what could I do?</t3010> <t3011>I had no hope of intervening successfully; and at times I thought that your sister might still have enough influence over him to reclaim him.</t3011> <t3012>But after such ignominious treatment, who knows what his intentions towards her might be?</t3012> <t3013>Whatever they may have been, however, she may now feel grateful for her situation, and undoubtedly will be more so later, when she compares it to that of my poor Eliza, when she thinks of the miserable and desperate situation of this poor girl and imagines her with an affection as strong for him, as strong as she herself has for him, and with a spirit tormented by self-recriminations, which will accompany her throughout her life.</t3013> <t3014>Surely this comparison will be of some use to her.</t3014> <t3015>She will feel that her own sufferings are nothing.</t3015> <t3016>They do not stem from misconduct and cannot bring her disgrace.</t3016> <t3017>On the contrary, they should make each of her friends' friendship towards her grow.</t3017> <t3018>The concern for her misfortune and the respect for the fortitude underlying it should reinforce all affections.</t3018> <t3019>However, use your own discretion in communicating to her what I have told you.</t3019> <t3020>You must know best what effect it will have; and if I had not believed very seriously and from the bottom of my heart that it could be of some use to her, that it could alleviate her sufferings, I would not have allowed myself to disturb her with this account of the afflictions my family has had to endure, a narrative with which it might be suspected that I am trying to exalt myself at the expense of others.</t3020>
<t3021>Elinor received these words with deep gratitude, also assisted by the certainty that the knowledge of what had happened would be of significant benefit to Marianne.</t3021>
<t3022>—For me, the most painful thing —he said— has been Marianne's efforts to free him from all blame, more than anything else, because it agitates her more than a full conviction of his unworthiness could.</t3022> <t3023>Although she suffers a lot at first, I am sure she will soon find relief.</t3023> <t3024>You —he continued—, have you seen Mr. Willoughby since he left Barton?</t3024>
<t3025>—Yes —he replied gravely—, once.</t3025> <t3026>It was inevitable that I would meet him once.</t3026>
<t3027>Elinor, startled by his tone, looked at him anxiously, saying:</t3027>
<t3028>—What!</t3028> <t3029>Did you meet him to...?</t3029>
<t3030>—It couldn't have been any other way.</t3030> <t3031>Eliza had confessed to me, albeit very reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to the city, fifteen days after me, we arranged to meet, he to defend his conduct, I to punish it.</t3031> <t3032>We returned unscathed, and thus the encounter never became public.</t3032>
<t3033>Elinor sighed at the fanciful and unnecessary nature of it all, but since it concerned a man and a soldier, she pretended not to disapprove.</t3033>
<t3034>—That is —said Colonel Brandon after a pause— the unfortunate similarity between the fate of the mother and that of the daughter, and how I have failed in what was entrusted to me!</t3034>
<t3035>—Is she still in the city?</t3035>
<t3036>—No; as soon as she recovered from childbirth, since I found her about to give birth, I took her and her child to the countryside, and there they remain to this day.</t3036>
<t3037>Shortly after, thinking that he was preventing Elinor from accompanying her sister, the colonel ended his visit, after once again receiving her most heartfelt thanks and leaving her filled with pity and affection for him.</t3037>
<t3038>CHAPTER XXXII</t3038>
<t3039>When Miss Dashwood disclosed this conversation in detail to her sister, as she did with great promptness, the effect it had on the latter was not entirely what the former had expected.</t3039> <t3040>It was not that Marianne seemed to distrust the authenticity of what was related, for she paid the most calm and docile attention to everything, did not object or comment on anything, at no point tried to justify Willoughby, and with her tears seemed to show that she felt any justification was impossible.</t3040> <t3041>But although her subsequent behavior gave Elinor the certainty that she had indeed managed to convince her of the young man's guilt; although she was pleased to see that, as a consequence, Marianne no longer avoided Colonel Brandon when he visited them, conversed with him, and even on her own initiative, with a kind of compassionate respect, and although she saw her in a less exasperatedly irritable mood than before, she did not see her any less unhappy.</t3041> <t3042>Her mind was stable, but it had settled into a gloomy despondency.</t3042> <t3043>She was more pained by the loss of the image she had of Willoughby than by having lost his love; that he had seduced and abandoned Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt about what the young man's intentions towards herself might have once been, all of this weighed on her so much that she could not bring herself to talk about her feelings even with Elinor; and with her quiet absorption in her sorrows, she made her sister suffer more than if she had opened her heart to her by speaking about them over and over again.</t3043>
<t3044>To recount what Mrs. Dashwood felt and said upon receiving and responding to Elinor's letter would be merely to repeat what her daughters had already felt and said; a disappointment scarcely less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's.</t3044> <t3045>One after another, she sent them long letters, in which she spoke of her sorrow and her thoughts; she expressed her anxiety and concern for Marianne and called upon her to bear her misfortune with fortitude.</t3045> <t3046>Terrible indeed must Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could speak of fortitude!</t3046> <t3047>How vexing and humiliating the source of her laments must be, for Mrs. Dashwood not to want to see her giving in to them!</t3047>
<t3048>Against her own interests and convenience, Mrs. Dashwood had decided that, at that moment, it would be better for Marianne to be anywhere but Barton, where everything in sight would intensely and painfully remind her of the past by constantly bringing Willoughby to mind as she had known him there.</t3048> <t3049>Thus, she recommended to her daughters that under no circumstances should they shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings, for although they had never precisely determined its duration, everyone expected it to last at least five or six weeks.</t3049> <t3050>There, they would not be able to avoid the various activities, projects, and company that Barton could not offer them and which, she hoped, might occasionally cause Marianne, without realizing it, to take an interest in something beyond herself and even to have a bit of fun, much as she now disdainfully rejected both possibilities.</t3050>
<t3051>As for the danger of encountering Willoughby again, her mother thought that Marianne was as safe in the city as in the countryside, given that no one among those who considered themselves their friends would now admit him into their company.</t3051> <t3052>No one would intentionally make their paths cross; through negligence, they would never be exposed to a surprise; and chance had less opportunity to occur among the crowds of London than in the isolation of Barton, where it could impose his presence on her during his visit to Allenham on the occasion of his marriage, a fact that Mrs. Dashwood had initially considered probable, and now had come to expect as certain.</t3052>
<t3053>She had yet another reason to wish her daughters to remain where they were: a letter from her stepson had informed her that he and his wife would be in London before mid-February, and she considered it proper that they see their brother from time to time.</t3053>
<t3054>Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion and then submitted to it without objections, despite it being completely different from what she desired or expected and although she believed it to be a perfect mistake based on wrong reasons; a mistake that, moreover, by demanding her stay in London, deprived her of the only possible relief to her misery — her mother's intimate compassion — and condemned her to a company and situations that would prevent her from knowing even a single moment of peace.</t3054>
<t3055>Nevertheless, it was a great comfort for Marianne that what caused her pain meant a benefit for her sister; and Elinor, for her part, suspecting that it would not be up to her to completely avoid Edward, calmed herself by thinking that although prolonging their stay in London would go against her own happiness, it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return to Devonshire.</t3055>
<t3056>Their care in protecting her sister from hearing Willoughby's name was not in vain.</t3056> <t3057>Marianne, though unknowingly, reaped all its benefits; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever mentioned him in her presence.</t3057> <t3058>Elinor wished they had equally refrained from doing so in her presence, but such a thing was impossible, and thus she was forced to listen day after day to their expressions of indignation.</t3058>
<t3059>Sir John would not have believed it possible.</t3059> <t3060>“A man of whom he had always had so many reasons to think well!</t3060> <t3061>A boy of such good character!</t3061> <t3062>He didn't believe there was a better rider in all of England!</t3062> <t3063>It was something inexplicable.</t3063> <t3064>He wished with all his heart to see him in hell.</t3064> <t3065>He would never speak to him again, anywhere he met him, for anything in the world!</t3065> <t3066>No, not even if he ran into him at the Barton inn and they had to wait together for two hours.</t3066> <t3067>That scoundrel!</t3067> <t3068>That disloyal dog!</t3068> <t3069>Just the last time they had met, he had offered to give him one of Folly's puppies!</t3069> <t3070>Well, no! With this, it was all over!”</t3070>
<t3071>In her own way, Mrs. Palmer was equally angry.</t3071> <t3072>“She was determined to immediately break off all relations with him, and thanked heaven for never having met him.</t3072> <t3073>She wished with all her heart that Combe Magna was not so close to Cleveland; but it didn't matter, because it was too far for visits; she hated him so much that she was determined never to utter his name again, and would tell everyone she saw that he was a scoundrel.”</t3073>
<t3074>The rest of Mrs. Palmer's adherence to Marianne's cause was manifested in procuring all possible details about the upcoming wedding and communicating them to Elinor.</t3074> <t3075>Soon she could say which coachmaker was building their new carriage, who was painting Mr. Willoughby's portrait, and in which shop Miss Grey's clothes could be seen.</t3075>
<t3076>The calm and courteous indifference of Lady Middleton was, in these circumstances, a welcome relief to Elinor's spirit, often overwhelmed as it was by the vociferous compassion of others.</t3076> <t3077>It was a balm for her to know that she did not arouse any interest in at least one person in her circle of friends; a relief to know that there was someone who would be with her without feeling any curiosity about the details, nor anxiety about her sister's health.</t3077>
<t3078>It often happens that the circumstances of the moment lead to attributing more value to any given trait than it actually has; and so it happened that sometimes such eager commiseration annoyed Elinor to the point of considering good manners more important for well-being than a good heart.</t3078>
<t3079>Lady Middleton expressed her opinion on the matter once or twice a day, if the topic came up frequently, saying: "What a terrible thing, indeed!" and through this continuous yet gentle release, she was not only able to visit the Miss Dashwoods from the beginning without the slightest emotion, but very soon without even remembering a word of the whole matter; and having thus defended the dignity of her own sex and decidedly censured what was wrong in the other, she felt free to protect the interests of her group, so she decided (although somewhat against Sir John's opinion) that, as Mrs. Willoughby would be an elegant and wealthy woman at the same time, she would leave her card as soon as she was married.</t3079>
<t3080>The delicate and always prudent inquiries of Colonel Brandon were never poorly received by Miss Dashwood.</t3080> <t3081>With the friendly zeal with which he had strived to alleviate her, he had profusely earned the privilege of intimately discussing her sister's disappointment, and they always conversed with complete confidence.</t3081> <t3082>The main reward for the colonel for the painful effort of revealing past sufferings and current humiliations was the compassionate look with which Marianne used to observe him and the sweetness of her voice whenever she was obliged (though this did not happen often) or forced herself to speak to him.</t3082> <t3083>These were the things that assured him that his effort had succeeded in increasing the goodwill towards him, and that allowed Elinor to hope that this goodwill would increase even more; but Mrs. Jennings, ignorant of all this, and knowing only that the colonel remained as serious as ever and that she could not persuade him to make his marriage proposal himself or to entrust it to her, after two days began to think that, instead of by mid-summer, there would be no wedding between them until Michaelmas, and by the end of the week she was already thinking that there would be no wedding at all.</t3083> <t3084>The good understanding between the colonel and the eldest Miss Dashwood rather led to the conclusion that the honors of the mulberry tree, the gutter, and the arbor under the yew would all correspond to her; and, for a time, Mrs. Jennings stopped thinking about Mr. Ferrars.</t3084>
<t3085>At the beginning of February, less than two weeks after receiving Willoughby's letter, Elinor had to take on the difficult task of informing her sister that he had gotten married.</t3085> <t3086>She had made sure that the news was conveyed to her as soon as it was known that the ceremony had taken place, as she wanted to prevent her sister from finding out through the newspapers, which she saw her anxiously examining every morning.</t3086>
<t3087>Marianne received the news with absolute composure; she made no comment on it and at first shed no tears; but after a short while, she burst into tears, and for the rest of the day remained in a state scarcely less painful than when she first learned she had to expect that marriage.</t3087>
<t3088>The Willoughbys left the city as soon as they were married; and Elinor began to hope that, now that there was no danger of seeing either of them, she might persuade her sister, who had not left the house since the moment she received the first blow, to gradually start going out again as before.</t3088>
<t3089>Around that time, the two Miss Steeles, newly arrived at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Building, Holborn, reappeared at the homes of their more important relatives in Conduit and Berkeley Street, both places where they were received with great cordiality.</t3089>
<t3090>Elinor could only regret seeing them.</t3090> <t3091>Their presence was always distressing to her, and it was extremely difficult for her to respond with any kindness to the overwhelming pleasure Lucy showed upon discovering that they were still in the city.</t3091>
<t3092>—I would have felt very disappointed if I hadn't found her here anymore —she repeated over and over, with a strong emphasis on the word—.</t3092> <t3093>But I always thought she would be here.</t3093> <t3094>I was almost sure she wouldn't leave London for quite some time still; although you told me in Barton, remember?, that she wouldn't stay more than a month.</t3094> <t3095>But at that moment I thought it was most likely that she would change her mind when the time came.</t3095> <t3096>It would have been such a great pity to have left before the arrival of her brother and sister-in-law.</t3096> <t3097>And now, surely, she won't be in any hurry to leave.</t3097> <t3098>I'm incredibly happy that she didn't keep her word.</t3098>
<t3099>Elinor understood her perfectly, and she was forced to draw upon all her self-control to pretend that she did not.</t3099>
<t3100>—Well, dear —said Mrs. Jennings—, and how did you come?</t3100>
<t3101>—Not in the stagecoach, I assure you —replied Miss Steele with instant joy—; we came all the way by post chaise, in the company of a very elegant young man.</t3101> <t3102>The Reverend Davies was coming to town, so we thought of renting a carriage together; he behaved in the most gentlemanly manner and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did.</t3102>
<t3103>—Well, well! —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings—.</t3103> <t3104>Very nice!</t3104> <t3105>And the reverend is single, I suppose.</t3105>
<t3106>—There you have it —said Miss Steele, with an affected smile—; everyone jokes with me about the reverend, and I can't imagine why.</t3106> <t3107>My cousins say they are sure I made a conquest; but, for my part, I assure them that I have never thought of him for even a minute.</t3107> <t3108>"Good heavens, here comes your beau, Nancy!" my cousin said to me the other day, when she saw him crossing the street towards the house.</t3108> <t3109>"My beau, no way!" I said to her, "I can't imagine who you're talking about.</t3109> <t3110>The reverend is not my suitor at all."</t3110>
<t3111>—Sure, sure, all of that sounds very good... but it won't do any good: the reverend is the man, I can already see it.</t3111>
<t3112>—No, not at all! —replied her cousin with affected anxiety—, and I beg you to deny it if you ever hear it said.</t3112>
<t3113>Mrs. Jennings immediately gave her all the necessary assurances that she certainly would not do it, making Miss Steele completely happy.</t3113>
<t3114>—I suppose you will stay with your brother and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to the city —she said.</t3114> <t3115>Lucy, resuming her attack after a pause in the hostile insinuations.</t3115>
<t3116>—No, I don't think we will.</t3116>
<t3117>—Oh, yes, I would say they will.</t3117>
<t3118>Elinor did not want to give him the satisfaction and continue with her refusals.</t3118>
<t3119>—How pleasant it is that Mrs. Dashwood can do without you two for such a long time!</t3119>
<t3120>—So long, no way! —Mrs. Jennings interjected—.</t3120> <t3121>But the visit has just begun!</t3121>
<t3122>Such a response silenced Lucy.</t3122>
<t3123>—I regret that we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood —said Miss Steele—.</t3123> <t3124>I am very sorry that she is not well —for Marianne had left the room upon their arrival.</t3124>
<t3125>—You are very kind.</t3125> <t3126>My sister will also regret having missed the pleasure of seeing you; but lately, she has been very affected by nervous headaches, which make her unable to visit or converse.</t3126>
<t3127>—Oh, dear, what a pity!</t3127> <t3128>But when it comes to old friends like Lucy and me... maybe he would want to see us; and I assure you we wouldn't say a word.</t3128>
<t3129>Elinor, with the utmost courtesy, declined the proposition.</t3129> <t3130>“Perhaps her sister was lying down, or in a dressing gown, and therefore could not come to see them.”</t3130>
<t3131>—Ah, but if that's all —exclaimed Miss Steele— we can just go see her ourselves.</t3131>
<t3132>Elinor began to find herself unable to endure such impertinence; but she was saved from having to restrain herself by Lucy's energetic reprimand to Anne, which, although it took away much of the sweetness from her manners, now, as on so many other occasions, served to dominate those of her sister.</t3132>
<t3133>CHAPTER XXXIII</t3133>
<t3134>After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's efforts and one morning agreed to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings for half an hour.</t3134> <t3135>However, she did so on the express condition that they would not make any visits and would limit themselves to accompanying her to Gra's jewelry store and Sackville Street, where Elinor was negotiating the exchange of a few of her mother's pieces of jewelry that looked outdated.</t3135>
<t3136>When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings remembered that at the other end of the street lived a lady whom she had to visit; and since she had nothing to do at Gray's, she decided that while her young friends carried out their task, she would make her visit and then return.</t3136>
<t3137>Upon ascending the steps, the Miss Dashwoods found such a number of people in front of them that no one seemed available to attend to their request, and they were forced to wait.</t3137> <t3138>They had no choice but to sit near the end of the counter that promised quicker service; only one gentleman was there, and it is likely that Elinor did not fail to hope to awaken his courtesy so that their request would be promptly attended to.</t3138> <t3139>But the accuracy of his vision and the delicacy of his taste proved to be greater than his courtesy.</t3139> <t3140>He was ordering a toothpick case for himself, and until he decided on its size, shape, and decorations—which he combined to his liking according to his own inventiveness after examining and analyzing all the cases in the shop for a quarter of an hour—he did not take the time to pay attention to the two ladies, except for two or three rather bold glances; a type of interest that served to imprint on Elinor the memory of a figure and face of pronounced, natural, and genuine insignificance, though groomed to the latest fashion.</t3140>
<t3141>Marianne spared herself the annoying feelings of contempt and resentment at the impertinence with which they had been examined and the boastful manners with which the subject chose the different horrors from the various cases presented to him, by remaining oblivious to it all; she was capable of becoming absorbed in her thoughts and ignoring everything happening around her in Mr. Gra's shop just as easily as in her own bedroom.</t3141>
<t3142>At last, the matter was resolved.</t3142> <t3143>The ivory, the gold, and the pearls, all received their placement, and after setting the final day on which their existence could be sustained without the possession of the case, the gentleman put on his gloves with studied calm and, casting another glance at the Miss Dashwoods, but a glance that seemed more to seek admiration than to express it, withdrew with a satisfied air in which true conceit and affected indifference were mixed.</t3143>
<t3144>Without wasting any time, Elinor presented her matters and was about to conclude them when another gentleman positioned himself beside her.</t3144> <t3145>She turned to look at him, and with some surprise, found that it was her brother.</t3145>
<t3146>The affection and pleasure they showed upon meeting were enough to make them believable in Mr. Gray's shop.</t3146> <t3147>In truth, John Dashwood was far from regretting seeing his sisters again; rather, the three were delighted, and he inquired about their mother in a respectful and attentive manner.</t3147>
<t3148>Elinor found out that he and Fanny had been in the city for two days.</t3148>
<t3149>—I had a great desire to visit them yesterday —said John—, but it was impossible, because we had to take Harry to see the wild animals at Exeter Exchange and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.</t3149> <t3150>Harry was absolutely happy.</t3150> <t3151>I had every intention of visiting them this morning, if I could find half an hour free, but there is always so much to do when you first arrive in town!</t3151> <t3152>I came here to order a seal for Fanny.</t3152> <t3153>But I believe that I will certainly be able to go to Berkeley Street tomorrow and meet Mrs. Jennings.</t3153> <t3154>I understand she is the owner of a very good fortune.</t3154> <t3155>And the Middletons also have to be introduced to me.</t3155> <t3156>As they are relatives of my mother-in-law, I will be pleased to pay them my respects.</t3156> <t3157>They have turned out to be excellent neighbors for you, as I have heard.</t3157>
<t3158>—Excellent, without any doubt.</t3158> <t3159>Their concern for our comfort, the friendship they have shown us in everything, goes beyond words.</t3159>
<t3160>—Believe me, I am very glad to hear it; truly, very glad.</t3160> <t3161>But it was to be expected: they are people of great fortune, they are related to you, and it was natural for them to offer you all the courtesies and necessary comforts to make your situation pleasant.</t3161> <t3162>So, you are comfortably settled in your little country house and you lack nothing.</t3162> <t3163>Edward described the place to us as something charming; the most complete of its kind that could exist, he said, and that all of you seemed to enjoy it very much.</t3163> <t3164>It was a great joy for us to know it, I assure you.</t3164>
<t3165>Elinor felt a bit embarrassed by her brother, and she did not regret that the arrival of Mrs. Jennings' servant, who came to tell her that his mistress was waiting for them at the door, freed her from the need to respond to him.</t3165>
<t3166>Mr. Dashwood accompanied them to the steps, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and after expressing once again his hope of being able to visit them the next day, he withdrew.</t3166>
<t3167>The visit went as it should.</t3167> <t3168>He arrived with the false excuse that his wife had not been able to come because "she was so busy with her mother that she really didn't have time to go anywhere else."</t3168> <t3169>Mrs. Jennings, for her part, immediately assured him that she didn't stand on ceremony, because they were all cousins, or something like that, and that she would soon visit Mrs. John Dashwood, and that she would bring her sisters-in-law with her.</t3169> <t3170>His treatment of them, though reserved, was very affectionate; towards Mrs. Jennings, it was solicitous courtesy; and when Colonel Brandon arrived shortly after, he observed him with a curiosity that seemed to say he only waited to know he was rich to extend to him the same courtesy.</t3170>
<t3171>After staying for half an hour, he asked Elinor to go with him to Conduit Street so that she could introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.</t3171> <t3172>As it was a beautiful day, she agreed immediately.</t3172> <t3173>And no sooner had they left the house, he began to ask her questions.</t3173>
<t3174>—Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?</t3174>
<t3175>—Yes, he has a very good property in Dorsetshire.</t3175>
<t3176>—I'm glad.</t3176> <t3177>He seems like a very gentlemanly man, and I believe, Elinor, that I can congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable situation in life.</t3177>
<t3178>—To me, brother... what do you mean?</t3178>
<t3179>—He likes you.</t3179> <t3180>I observed him very closely, and I am convinced of it.</t3180> <t3181>How much is his fortune?</t3181>
<t3182>—I think about two thousand a year.</t3182>
<t3183>—Two thousand a year.</t3183> <t3184>—And then, striving to reach a tone of enthusiastic generosity, he added—: Elinor, for you, I would wish with all my heart that it were double.</t3184>
<t3185>—Yes, I believe you —replied Elinor—, but I am sure that Colonel Brandon has no desire whatsoever to marry me.</t3185>
<t3186>—You are mistaken, Elinor; very mistaken.</t3186> <t3187>With a little effort on your part, you would achieve it.</t3187> <t3188>Perhaps at the moment he is undecided, the smallness of your fortune may deter him, or his friends may advise against it.</t3188> <t3189>But those small attentions and encouragements that ladies can so easily offer will persuade him despite himself.</t3189> <t3190>And there is no reason why you should not try to win him over.</t3190> <t3191>It should not be assumed that any other affection you may have had before... in short, you know that such an affection is entirely impossible, the objections are insurmountable... you are too sensible not to realize it.</t3191> <t3192>Colonel Brandon is the man; and for my part, I will not spare any kindness towards him, so that you and your family may please him.</t3192> <t3193>It is a union that should please everyone.</t3193> <t3194>In short, it is something that —lowering the voice to a fatuous whisper— will be extremely convenient for all parties.</t3194> <t3195>—Reconsidering things, however, he added—: That is, I mean... all your friends long to see you well settled, Fanny especially, because your well-being is very dear to her, I assure you.</t3195> <t3196>And to her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very kind woman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she herself said so the other day.</t3196>
<t3197>Elinor did not deign to respond.</t3197>
<t3198>—Now, it would be extraordinary —he continued—, something very funny, if Fanny could see a brother and I a sister reaching a stable situation in their lives at the same time.</t3198> <t3199>And it is not very unlikely.</t3199>
<t3200>—Is Mr. Edward Ferrars getting married? —said Elinor with a determined tone.</t3200>
<t3201>—It is not yet decided, but there is something of that in the air.</t3201> <t3202>She has an excellent mother.</t3202> <t3203>Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost generosity, will be present and will allocate a thousand pounds annually if the union takes place.</t3203> <t3204>The lady in question is the honorable Miss Morton, only daughter of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds: a very desirable union for both parties, and I have no doubt that it will materialize in the long run.</t3204> <t3205>A thousand pounds annually is a significant amount for a mother to part with, to give away forever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a very noble spirit.</t3205> <t3206>To give you another example of her generosity: the other day, as soon as we arrived in the city, aware that we were not abundant in money at the moment, she placed two hundred pounds in banknotes in Fanny's hands.</t3206> <t3207>Something very welcome, because our expenses are enormous here.</t3207>
<t3208>He paused, waiting for her approval and sympathy, and she forced herself to say:</t3208>
<t3209>—No doubt your expenses, both in the city and in the countryside, must be considerable, but you also have a good income.</t3209>
<t3210>—Not as good, I would dare to say, as many people suppose.</t3210> <t3211>I do not complain, however; it is undoubtedly comfortable and, I hope, will improve over time.</t3211> <t3212>We are currently fencing the common land of Norland, which is a very serious expense.</t3212> <t3213>And I also made a small purchase this half-year, the East Kingham farm, you must remember it, where old Gibson used to live.</t3213> <t3214>Those lands were so convenient for me in every way, so directly adjoining my property, that I felt it was my duty to buy them.</t3214> <t3215>I would not have forgiven myself for letting them fall into other hands.</t3215> <t3216>You have to pay for what is convenient for you, and that has indeed cost me a great amount of money.</t3216>
<t3217>—More than you think they are worth, both really and intrinsically?</t3217>
<t3218>—Come on, I hope not.</t3218> <t3219>I could have sold them the next day for more than I paid; but as for the price, it would have been quite unfortunate, because at that moment the values were so low that if I hadn't had the necessary amount in the bank, I would have had to auction them off at a great loss.</t3219>
<t3220>Elinor couldn't help but smile.</t3220>
<t3221>—When we arrived at Norland, we also had another large unavoidable expense.</t3221> <t3222>Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the effects from Stanhill that remained at Norland (and they were quite valuable) to your mother.</t3222> <t3223>I am far from complaining about it; the right he had to dispose of his property as he wished is unquestionable.</t3223> <t3224>But, as a consequence, we have had to make significant purchases of linens, crockery, etc., to replace what was given away.</t3224> <t3225>You can imagine, after all these expenses, how far we are from being rich and how welcome Mrs. Ferrars' kindness is.</t3225>
<t3226>—Of course —said Elinor—; and with the support of his generosity, I hope they can come to live in more comfortable conditions.</t3226>
<t3227>—One or two more years can contribute greatly to that —he replied gravely—; however, there is still much to be done.</t3227> <t3228>Not a single stone has been laid for Fanny's greenhouse, and the flower garden is nothing more than a plan.</t3228>
<t3229>—Where will the greenhouse be located?</t3229>
<t3230>—On the small hill behind the house.</t3230> <t3231>We have cut down all the old walnut trees to make space for it.</t3231> <t3232>It will be a beautiful view from various parts of the park, and right on the slope in front of it will be the flower garden, so it will look very nice.</t3232> <t3233>We have already removed the old hawthorns that grew in patches on the top.</t3233>
<t3234>Elinor kept to herself the comments and objections she had on the matter, and was grateful that Marianne had not been present to share her irritation.</t3234>
<t3235>Having already said enough to make clear his poverty and avoid the need to buy a pair of earrings for each of his sisters on his next visit to Gray's, his thoughts took a more cheerful turn and he began to congratulate Elinor on having a friend like Mrs. Jennings.</t3235>
<t3236>—She truly seems like a very valuable woman.</t3236> <t3237>Her house, her way of life, everything speaks of a very good income, and it is a relationship that has not only been of great use to them so far, but in the long run can prove to be materially beneficial.</t3237> <t3238>The invitation she has extended to them to the city certainly favors them; and, in any case, it is such a good sign of the esteem in which she holds them, that she will surely not forget them at the time of her death.</t3238> <t3239>She must have quite a bit to leave behind.</t3239>
<t3240>—Nothing at all, I would say rather; the only thing she has is the usufruct of her husband's assets, which will pass to her children.</t3240>
<t3241>—But it is unthinkable that he lives according to his income.</t3241> <t3242>Few people who are moderately prudent do so; and whatever he saves, he can distribute.</t3242>
<t3243>—And don't you think it's more likely that he will leave it to his daughters rather than to us?</t3243>
<t3244>—His daughters are very well married, so I don't see the need to remember them anymore.</t3244> <t3245>On the other hand, in my opinion, by considering them so much and treating them the way he does, he has given you a kind of right in his future plans that a prudent woman should not overlook.</t3245> <t3246>There is nothing kinder than his treatment towards you, and he can hardly do it without being aware of the expectations he raises with it.</t3246>
<t3247>—But it does not awaken any in those who have the most stake in this.</t3247> <t3248>In truth, brother, your concern for our well-being and prosperity is going too far.</t3248>
<t3249>—Well, of course —he said, feigning a reflective air—, it is very little, very little that people can control.</t3249> <t3250>But, my dear Elinor, what is wrong with Marianne?</t3250> <t3251>She looks very bad, her color is off, and she has lost a lot of weight.</t3251> <t3252>Is she ill?</t3252>
<t3253>—It's not good, during the last few weeks he has been suffering from nerves.</t3253>
<t3254>—I'm sorry to hear that.</t3254> <t3255>At her age, any illness destroys freshness forever!</t3255> <t3256>And hers has been so brief!</t3256> <t3257>In September, she was a girl as pretty as the best I've ever seen, very attractive to men.</t3257> <t3258>Her type of beauty had something especially seductive.</t3258> <t3259>I remember Fanny used to say that she was going to marry sooner and better than you; not that she doesn't have a great affection for you, but that's what she thought.</t3259> <t3260>However, she was wrong.</t3260> <t3261>I doubt that Marianne will now marry a man worth at most five hundred or six hundred pounds a year, and I would be very surprised if you don't do better.</t3261> <t3262>Dorsetshire!</t3262> <t3263>I know very little of Dorsetshire, but, my dear Elinor, I will be delighted to learn more; and I think I can promise you that Fanny and I will be among your first and most pleased visitors.</t3263>
<t3264>Elinor took great care in trying to convince her brother that there was no possibility of a marriage between her and Colonel Brandon; but the expectation delighted him too much to give it up, and he was determined to achieve a closer relationship with that gentleman and encourage the marriage through all possible attentions.</t3264> <t3265>His remorse for having done nothing personally for his sisters created in him an enormous eagerness for everyone else to do much for them; and a proposal from Colonel Brandon or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings were the easiest ways to make up for his own neglect.</t3265>
<t3266>They were fortunate to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John arrived before they ended their visit.</t3266> <t3267>Courtesies abounded on both sides.</t3267> <t3268>Sir John was always ready to be pleased with everyone, and although Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses, he soon considered him a good man; Lady Middleton, meanwhile, seeing enough fashionable elements in his appearance, thought it worthwhile to associate with him; and Mr. Dashwood left delighted with both of them.</t3268>
<t3269>—I will have very pleasant things to tell Fanny —he said to his sister as they were returning—.</t3269> <t3270>Lady Middleton is truly a very elegant woman!</t3270> <t3271>She is the kind of woman that Fanny will love to meet.</t3271> <t3272>And Mrs. Jennings too, a woman of excellent manners, although not as elegant as her daughter.</t3272> <t3273>Your sister, my wife, has no reason to have reservations about visiting her, which, to be honest, has been somewhat the case, and very understandably so, since all we knew was that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had obtained all his money by low means; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars had decided beforehand that neither Mrs. Jennings nor her daughters were the kind of women Fanny would want to associate with.</t3273> <t3274>But now I can bring them the most satisfactory references about both.</t3274>
<t3275>CHAPTER XXXIV</t3275>
<t3276>Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment that the very next day she went to visit Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and the reward for such confidence was finding that even the former, even the woman with whom her sisters-in-law were staying, was not at all unworthy of her attention; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her to be one of the most charming women in the world!</t3276>
<t3277>Lady Middleton also liked Mrs. Dashwood very much.</t3277> <t3278>There was a kind of cold selfishness in both of them that made them feel mutually attracted; and they sympathized with each other in a bland, circumspect manner and a total lack of understanding.</t3278>
<t3279>The same manners, however, that made Mrs. John Dashwood deserving of Lady Middleton's good opinion did not satisfy Mrs. Jennings, who found her to be nothing more than a little woman with an arrogant air and an unfriendly demeanor, showing no affection for her husband's sisters and seeming to have almost nothing to say to them; during the quarter of an hour she granted to Berkeley Street, she spent at least seven and a half minutes in silence.</t3279>
<t3280>Elinor would have liked to know, although she preferred not to ask, if Edward was in town; but for nothing in the world would Fanny have voluntarily mentioned his name in front of her until she could say that the marriage with Miss Morton was settled, or until her husband's expectations regarding Colonel Brandon had been confirmed; and this was because she believed they were still so attached to each other that no amount of care was too much to keep them separated in word and deed.</t3280> <t3281>However, the report she refused to give soon came from another source.</t3281> <t3282>It wasn't long before Lucy claimed Elinor's sympathy for not having been able to see Edward yet, although he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.</t3282> <t3283>He didn't dare go to Bartlett's Buildings for fear of being discovered, and although their impatience to see each other was indescribable, for the moment all they could do was write to each other.</t3283>
<t3284>Edward soon confirmed for himself that he was in the city by visiting Berkeley Street twice.</t3284> <t3285>Twice they found his calling card on the table upon returning from their morning activities.</t3285> <t3286>Elinor was glad that he had gone, but even more glad that she had not met him.</t3286>
<t3287>The Dashwoods were so remarkably delighted with the Middletons that, although it was not their custom to give anything, they decided to offer a dinner in their honor, and shortly after meeting them, they invited them to Harley Street, where they had rented an excellent house for three months.</t3287> <t3288>They also invited their sisters and Mrs. Jennings, and John Dashwood made sure to secure the presence of Colonel Brandon, who, always happy to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received their eager courtesies with some surprise, but much pleasure.</t3288> <t3289>They were going to meet Mrs. Ferrars, but Elinor could not know if her children would be part of the gathering.</t3289> <t3290>Nevertheless, the anticipation of seeing her was enough to spark her interest in attending this engagement; for although now she was going to meet Edward's mother without that immense anxiety that in the past would have been inevitable for her, although now she could see her with total indifference regarding the opinion she might arouse in her, her desire to be in Mrs. Ferrars' company, her curiosity to know what she was like, were as vivid as before.</t3290>
<t3291>Very shortly after, all the interest with which he awaited the dinner invitation increased, with more intensity than pleasure, upon learning that the Misses Steele would also be attending.</t3291>
<t3292>Such a good impression had they managed to create of themselves before Lady Middleton, so pleasing had they become to her through their tireless attentions, that although Lucy was by no means elegant, and her sister not even well-educated, she was as willing as Sir John to invite them to spend one or two weeks in Conduit Street; and as soon as they heard of the Dashwoods' invitation, the Miss Steeles found it very convenient to arrive a few days before the date set for the party.</t3292>
<t3293>Their attempts to attract the attention of Mrs. John Dashwood by presenting themselves as the nieces of the gentleman who had been taking care of her brother for many years would not have been very effective, however, to secure them a seat at her table; but as guests of Lady Middleton, they had to be well received; and Lucy, who had long desired to personally meet the family to get a closer view of their characters and the obstacles that would present themselves to her, and at the same time the opportunity to strive to please them, had rarely been as happy in her life as when she received Mrs. John Dashwood's card.</t3293>
<t3294>The effect on Elinor was different.</t3294> <t3295>She immediately began to think that Edward, who lived with his mother, must be invited, just like his mother, to a dinner organized by his sister; and to see him for the first time, after everything that had happened, in the company of Lucy!</t3295> <t3296>She didn't know if she could bear it!</t3296>
<t3297>Elinor's apprehensions were perhaps not entirely based on reason, and certainly not on reality.</t3297> <t3298>They found relief, however, not in her own reflections, but in Lucy's goodwill, who believed she was inflicting a terrible disappointment by telling her that Edward would by no means be at Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to hurt her further by convincing her that such absence was due to the enormous affection he felt for her, which he was unable to hide when they were together.</t3298>
<t3299>And the important date arrived, that Tuesday when the two young women would be introduced to their formidable mother-in-law.</t3299>
<t3300>—Have pity on me, dear Miss Dashwood! —said Lucy, as they ascended the steps together, for the Middletons had arrived so shortly after Mrs. Jennings that the servant guided them all at the same time—.</t3300> <t3301>No one else here knows what I feel.</t3301> <t3302>I can barely stand, I assure you.</t3302> <t3303>Good heavens!</t3303> <t3304>In a few moments, I will see the person on whom all my happiness depends, the one who is going to be my mother!</t3304>
<t3305>Elinor could have immediately alleviated her uneasiness by suggesting the possibility that it was Miss Morton's mother, and not her own, whom they were about to meet; but instead of doing that, she assured her, with great sincerity, that she did indeed sympathize with her, much to Lucy's great astonishment, who, although she truly felt uncomfortable, at least expected to be the object of Elinor's uncontrollable envy.</t3305>
<t3306>Mrs. Ferrars was a small and thin woman, upright to the point of appearing solemn in her demeanor, and serious to the point of acrimony in her expression.</t3306> <t3307>With a sallow complexion, her features were small, lacking both natural beauty and expressiveness; but a fortunate frown had saved her from the misfortune of a bland countenance, endowing her with the stern traits of pride and ill temper.</t3307> <t3308>She was not a woman of many words, since, unlike most people, she matched them to the quantity of her ideas; and of the few syllables she let fall, not a single one was directed at Miss Dashwood, whom she regarded with the energetic determination of finding nothing pleasant in her for any reason.</t3308>
<t3309>This behavior could not bother Elinor now.</t3309> <t3310>A few months earlier it would have hurt her greatly, but Mrs. Ferrars no longer had the power to make her unhappy; and the difference in how she treated the Misses Steele—a difference that seemed deliberately intended to humiliate her even more—only amused her.</t3310> <t3311>She couldn't help but smile at the friendliness of mother and daughter directed precisely towards the person—because they particularly singled out Lucy—who, if they had known what she knew, they would have been more eager to mortify; while she, who comparatively had no power to hurt them, was obviously looked down upon by both.</t3311> <t3312>But while she smiled at such misdirected friendliness, she couldn't think of the petty foolishness that originated it, nor contemplate the calculated attentions with which the Misses Steele sought its prolongation without the utmost contempt for all four of them.</t3312>
<t3313>Lucy was all joy at feeling so honorably distinguished; and the only thing missing for Miss Steele to achieve perfect happiness was for someone to make a joke about Reverend Davies.</t3313>
<t3314>The dinner was sumptuous, the servants were numerous, and everything spoke of the hostess's inclination towards ostentation and the host's ability to support it.</t3314> <t3315>Despite the improvements and additions being made to his property in Norland, and despite the fact that its owner had been just a few thousand pounds away from having to sell it at a loss, nothing seemed to indicate the indigence he had tried to deduce from it all; there appeared to be no poverty of any kind, except in the conversation... but there the deficiency was considerable.</t3315> <t3316>John Dashwood did not have much to say that was worth listening to, and his wife even less.</t3316> <t3317>But this was not a particular misfortune because the same was true for most of their guests, almost all of whom were victims of one or another of the following incapacities to be considered agreeable: lack of judgment, whether natural or cultivated; lack of elegance, lack of spirit, or lack of character.</t3317>
<t3318>When the ladies retired to the drawing room after dinner, that indigence became particularly evident, given that the gentlemen had enriched the conversation with a certain variety —the variety of politics, land enclosure, and horse training—, but all that ended and a single topic occupied the ladies until the arrival of coffee, and this was comparing the respective heights of Harry Dashwood and Lady Middleton's second son, William, who were approximately the same age.</t3318>
<t3319>If both children had been there, the matter could have been easily settled by measuring them at once; but since only Harry was present, everything was conjecture on both sides, and each one had the right to be equally adamant in their opinion and to repeat it over and over as many times as they wanted.</t3319>
<t3320>The following matches were taken:</t3320>
<t3321>Both mothers, although each convinced that her son was the tallest, politely voted in favor of the other.</t3321>
<t3322>The two grandmothers, with no less partiality but with greater sincerity, supported their own offspring with equal zeal.</t3322>
<t3323>Lucy, who for no reason wanted to please one mother less than the other, thought that the two little boys were remarkably tall for their age, and could not conceive that there was even the slightest difference between them; and Miss Steele, with even more eagerness, expressed herself as quickly as she could in favor of each of them.</t3323>
<t3324>Elinor, having once decided on William, thereby offending Mrs. Ferrars, and Fanny even more, did not see the need to keep insisting on the point; and Marianne, when asked for her opinion, offended everyone by declaring that she had no opinion to give, as she had never thought about the matter.</t3324>
<t3325>Before leaving Norland, Elinor had painted a pair of very pretty screens for her sister-in-law, which, newly mounted and brought to the house, decorated her current living room; and as these screens caught John Dashwood's eye while he followed the other gentlemen into the room, he took them and solicitously handed them to Colonel Brandon for him to admire.</t3325>
<t3326>—The eldest of my sisters made them —he said to him—, and you, as a man of taste, will surely like them.</t3326> <t3327>I don't know if you have seen any of her works before, but in general, she has a reputation for drawing very well.</t3327>
<t3328>The colonel, while denying any pretense of being knowledgeable, admired the screens with great enthusiasm, as he would have done with anything painted by Miss Dashwood; and as this naturally aroused the curiosity of the others, the paintings were passed from hand to hand to be examined by everyone.</t3328> <t3329>Mrs. Ferrars, not knowing they were Elinor's work, particularly asked to see them; and after being graced with Lady Middleton's approval, Fanny presented them to her mother, at the same time very considerately letting her know that they had been made by Miss Dashwood.</t3329>
<t3330>—Mmm —said Mrs. Ferrars—, very pretty —and without paying them the slightest attention, she returned them to her daughter.</t3330>
<t3331>Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude, for, blushing a little, she immediately said:</t3331>
<t3332>—They are very beautiful, ma'am, aren't they? —but then she was probably overcome by the fear of having been too courteous, too enthusiastic in her praise, because she immediately added—</t3332> <t3333>Don't you think, ma'am, that they have something of Miss Morton's painting style?</t3333> <t3334>Her painting is truly delightful.</t3334> <t3335>How well done her last landscape was!</t3335>
<t3336>—Very well.</t3336> <t3337>But she does everything very well.</t3337>
<t3338>Marianne could not bear this.</t3338> <t3339>She was already enormously upset with Mrs. Ferrars; and such untimely praise of another at Elinor's expense, although she had no idea what it meant, prompted her to say with great vehemence:</t3339>
<t3340>—What a curious way to praise something!</t3340> <t3341>And what is Miss Morton to us?</t3341> <t3342>Who knows her or who cares?</t3342> <t3343>It is Elinor we are thinking of and talking about.</t3343>
<t3344>And saying thus, he took the paintings from his sister-in-law's hands to admire them as they deserved.</t3344>
<t3345>Mrs. Ferrars seemed extremely angry, and becoming stiffer than ever, returned the offense with this sharp tirade:</t3345>
<t3346>—Miss Morton is the daughter of Lord Morton.</t3346>
<t3347>Fanny also seemed very angry, and her husband looked terrified at his sister's audacity.</t3347> <t3348>Elinor felt much more hurt by Marianne's vehemence than by what had caused it; but the look on Colonel Brandon's face, fixed on Marianne, clearly showed that he had only seen what was kind in.</t3348> <t3349>her reaction: the affectionate heart incapable of bearing even the slightest contempt directed at her sister.</t3349>
<t3350>Marianne's feelings did not stop there.</t3350> <t3351>It seemed to her that the cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars' general behavior towards her sister foreshadowed for Elinor the kind of obstacles and afflictions that her own wounded heart had taught her to fear; and driven by the strong impulse of her own sensitivity and affection, after a few moments she approached her sister's chair and, putting an arm around her neck and bringing her cheek close to hers, she said in a low but urgent voice:</t3351>
<t3352>—Dear, dear Elinor, don't listen to them.</t3352> <t3353>Don't let them make you unhappy.</t3353>
<t3354>She could not say more; overwhelmed, she hid her face on Elinor's shoulder and burst into tears.</t3354> <t3355>Everyone noticed, and almost everyone was concerned.</t3355> <t3356>Colonel Brandon stood up and walked towards them without knowing what he was doing.</t3356> <t3357>Mrs. Jennings, with a very judicious "Ah, poor thing!", immediately handed her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately furious against the author of this nervous affliction that he immediately moved to a seat near Lucy Steele and, in whispers, gave her a brief account of the whole unpleasant matter.</t3357>
<t3358>In a few minutes, however, Marianne recovered enough to put an end to all the commotion and sit back down with the others, although the impression of what had happened remained etched in her mood for the rest of the afternoon.</t3358>
<t3359>—Poor Marianne! —her brother said to Colonel Brandon in a low voice as soon as he could get his attention—.</t3359> <t3360>She does not have as good health as her sister; she is very nervous... she does not have Elinor's constitution; and it must be admitted that for a young woman who has been a beauty, it must be very painful to lose her personal attractiveness.</t3360> <t3361>Perhaps you do not know, but Marianne was remarkably beautiful until a few months ago... as beautiful as Elinor.</t3361> <t3362>And now, you can see that none of that remains.</t3362>
<t3363>CHAPTER XXXV</t3363>
<t3364>Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.</t3364> <t3365>She had found in her everything that made a closer union between the two families undesirable.</t3365> <t3366>She had seen enough of her arrogance, her meanness, and her decided prejudice against her to understand all the obstacles that would have hindered her engagement to Edward and postponed the marriage, if he had been free; and she had almost seen enough to be grateful, for her own sake, that the enormous impediment of his lack of freedom saved her from suffering under those that Mrs. Ferrars might have created; saved her from having to depend on her whim or having to win her good opinion.</t3366> <t3367>Or at least, if she was not able to be glad to see Edward chained to Lucy, she decided that, if Lucy had been more agreeable, she would have had to be glad.</t3367>
<t3368>Elinor thought with astonishment how Lucy could feel so exalted by Mrs. Ferrars' courtesies; how her interests and vanity could blind her so much as to make her believe that the attention given to her solely because she was not Elinor was a compliment directed at her... or to allow her to feel encouraged by a preference that was only granted to her out of ignorance of her true condition.</t3368> <t3369>But that this was the case was not only evident in Lucy's eyes at that moment, but it became even clearer the next day: obeying her wishes, Lady Middleton left her on Berkeley Street in the hope of seeing Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.</t3369>
<t3370>The occasion turned out to be favorable, because very soon after her arrival, a message from Mrs. Palmer made Mrs. Jennings leave.</t3370>
<t3371>—My dear friend —exclaimed Lucy as soon as they were alone—, I come to tell you how happy I am.</t3371> <t3372>Is there anything more flattering than the way Mrs. Ferrars treated me yesterday?</t3372> <t3373>How extremely kind she was!</t3373> <t3374>You know how much I dreaded the mere idea of seeing her; but as soon as I was introduced, her manner was so affable that it almost seemed she had taken a liking to me.</t3374> <t3375>Wasn't it so?</t3375> <t3376>You saw it all; and didn't it leave you completely surprised?</t3376>
<t3377>—He was indeed very courteous to you.</t3377>
<t3378>—Cortés! How could he have seen only courtesy!</t3378> <t3379>I saw much more... a kindness directed at no one but me!</t3379> <t3380>No pride, no haughtiness, and the same with his sister-in-law: all sweetness and affability!</t3380>
<t3381>Elinor would have liked to talk about something else, but Lucy kept pressing her to acknowledge that she had reasons to feel so happy, and Elinor was forced to continue.</t3381>
<t3382>—No doubt, if they had known about your engagement —he told her—, nothing could be more flattering than the way they treated you; but since that is not the case...</t3382>
<t3383>—I imagined you would say that —replied Lucy promptly—; but why would Mrs. Ferrars pretend to like me if she didn't... and pleasing her means everything to me.</t3383> <t3384>She cannot deprive me of my satisfaction.</t3384> <t3385>I am sure that everything will end well and that all the obstacles I foresaw will disappear.</t3385> <t3386>Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman, just like her sister-in-law.</t3386> <t3387>Both of them are adorable!</t3387> <t3388>I am surprised I have never heard you say how pleasant Mrs. Dashwood is!</t3388>
<t3389>For this, Elinor had no response to give, and she did not attempt one.</t3389>
<t3390>Is Miss Dashwood unwell?</t3390> <t3391>She seems downcast, she doesn't speak... surely she doesn't feel well.</t3391> <t3392>—My health has never been better.</t3392>
<t3393>—I am truly glad from the bottom of my heart, but it really didn't seem like it.</t3393> <t3394>I would deeply regret if you were to fall ill... you, who have been the greatest comfort in the world to me!</t3394> <t3395>Only God knows what would have become of me without your friendship.</t3395>
<t3396>Elinor attempted a polite response, though doubting greatly her ability to achieve it.</t3396> <t3397>But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, who immediately replied:</t3397>
<t3398>—In truth, I am fully convinced of his affection for me, and along with Edward's love, it is my greatest comfort.</t3398> <t3399>Poor Edward!</t3399> <t3400>But now there is something good: we will be able to see each other, and very often, because as lady Middleton was delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, it seems to me that we will go quite often to Harley Street, and Edward spends half of his time with his sister.</t3400> <t3401>Moreover, lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars are going to visit now; and Mrs. Ferrars and her sister-in-law were so kind in saying more than once that they would always be delighted to see me.</t3401> <t3402>They are so charming!</t3402> <t3403>I am sure that if you ever tell her sister-in-law what I think of her, you will not be able to praise her enough.</t3403>
<t3404>But Elinor did not want to give her any hope that she would say anything to her sister-in-law.</t3404> <t3405>Lucy continued:</t3405>
<t3406>—I am sure I would have noticed immediately if Mrs. Ferrars had disliked me.</t3406> <t3407>If she had only given me a very formal nod, without saying a word, and then acted as if I didn't exist, without even looking at me with any kind of approval... you know what I mean..., if she had given me that intimidating treatment, I would have given up everything in despair.</t3407> <t3408>I wouldn't have been able to bear it.</t3408> <t3409>Because when she dislikes something, I know she shows it with the utmost rudeness.</t3409>
<t3410>Elinor could not give any response to this polite triumph; she was prevented by the door that opened wide, the servant announcing Mr. Ferrars, and the immediate entrance of Edward.</t3410>
<t3411>It was a very awkward moment, and this was evident from the expression on each of their faces.</t3411> <t3412>They all took on an extremely foolish air, and Edward seemed unsure whether to leave the room again or to keep moving forward.</t3412> <t3413>The very circumstance, in its worst form, that each had so fervently wished to avoid, had come upon them: not only were the three of them together, but they were also together without the alleviation that the presence of any other person would have provided.</t3413> <t3414>The ladies were the first to regain control over themselves.</t3414> <t3415>It was not Lucy's place to take the lead with any display, and it was necessary to continue maintaining the appearance of a secret.</t3415> <t3416>Thus, she had to limit herself to communicating her tenderness through her gaze, and after a slight greeting, she said no more.</t3416>
<t3417>But Elinor did have something more to do; and she was so anxious, for his sake and her own, to do it well, that after a moment of reflection she forced herself to welcome him with an almost casual and almost straightforward air and manner; and by striving and struggling with herself a little more, she even managed to improve them.</t3417> <t3418>She was not going to let Lucy's presence or the awareness of any injustice towards her prevent her from saying that she was glad to see him and that she had been very sorry not to be at home when he had gone to Berkeley Street.</t3418> <t3419>Nor was she going to be deterred by Lucy's observant gaze, which she soon felt fixed on her, from giving him the attentions that, as both a friend and almost a relative, he deserved.</t3419>
<t3420>Elinor's attitude calmed Edward, who found enough courage to sit down; but his agitation was still greater than that of the young women to an extent explainable by the circumstances, although it was uncommon for his sex, as he lacked Lucy's cold-heartedness and Elinor's peace of mind.</t3420>
<t3421>Lucy, displaying a demure and placid demeanor, seemed determined not to contribute in any way to the comfort of others and remained completely silent; and almost everything that was said came from Elinor, who had to voluntarily provide all the information about her mother's health, their arrival in the city, etc., that Edward should have asked for, but did not.</t3421>
<t3422>Her efforts did not end there, for shortly after she felt heroically inclined to make the decision to leave Lucy and Edward alone, under the pretext of going to look for Marianne; and indeed she did, and with the utmost gallantry, for she paused several minutes on the landing of the staircase, with the most haughty composure, before going in search of her sister.</t3422> <t3423>When she did, however, Edward's outbursts had to cease, for Marianne's joy immediately dragged her into the living room.</t3423> <t3424>Her pleasure at seeing him was like all her other emotions, intense in themselves and intensely expressed.</t3424> <t3425>She went to meet him extending a hand, which he took, and greeting him with a voice where sisterly affection was evident.</t3425>
<t3426>—Dear Edward! —she exclaimed—.</t3426> <t3427>This is indeed a happy moment! It could almost make up for everything else!</t3427>
<t3428>Edward tried to respond to her kindness as it deserved, but in the presence of such a witness, he did not dare to say even half of what he truly felt.</t3428> <t3429>They sat down again, and for a few moments, everyone remained silent; Marianne, meanwhile, observed Edward and then Elinor with the most expressive tenderness, regretting only that the pleasure of both was hindered by the untimely presence of Lucy.</t3429> <t3430>Edward was the first to speak, and he did so to comment on Marianne's changed appearance and express his fear that London did not suit her well.</t3430>
<t3431>—Oh, don't think about me! —she replied with spirited fortitude, though her eyes filled with tears as she spoke—, don't think about my health.</t3431> <t3432>Elinor is fine, as you can see.</t3432> <t3433>That should be enough for you and me.</t3433>
<t3434>This observation was not going to make the situation any easier for Edward and Elinor, nor would it win the goodwill of Lucy, who looked at Mariana with an unfriendly expression.</t3434>
<t3435>—Do you like London? —Edward said to her, eager to say anything that would allow him to change the subject.</t3435>
<t3436>—Not at all.</t3436> <t3437>I expected to find great amusements here, but I have found none.</t3437> <t3438>Seeing you, Edward, has been the only comfort it has offered me; and thank God, you haven't changed.</t3438>
<t3439>He paused; no one said anything.</t3439>
<t3440>—I think, Elinor —added Marianne after a while—, that we should ask Edward to accompany us on our return to Barton.</t3440> <t3441>We will be leaving in one or two weeks, I imagine; and I trust that he will not refuse to accept this request.</t3441>
<t3442>The poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, no one knew, not even him.</t3442> <t3443>But Marianne, who noticed his agitation and who, without much effort, was able to attribute it to any cause that seemed convenient to her, felt completely satisfied and very soon began to talk about something else.</t3443>
<t3444>—What a day we had yesterday on Harley Street, Edward!</t3444> <t3445>So boring, so dreadfully boring!</t3445> <t3446>But —I have so much to tell you about it, which I can't say now.</t3446>
<t3447>And with such admirable discretion, she postponed for a moment when they could speak more privately her declaration regarding having found their mutual relatives more unbearable than ever, and the special displeasure that his mother had caused her.</t3447>
<t3448>—But, why weren't you there, Edward? Why didn't you go?</t3448>
<t3449>—I had another commitment.</t3449>
<t3450>—Another commitment!</t3450> <t3451>And how, if your friends were expecting you?</t3451>
<t3452>—Perhaps, Miss Marianne —exclaimed Lucy, eager to take some sort of revenge on her—, you believe that young men never honor their commitments, big or small, when they have no interest in fulfilling them.</t3452>
<t3453>Elinor felt very angry, but Marianne seemed completely insensitive to Lucy's sarcasm, as she responded with great calmness:</t3453>
<t3454>—Actually, it is not so; because, seriously speaking, I am sure that only his conscience kept Edward away from Harley Street.</t3454> <t3455>And I truly believe that his conscience is extremely delicate, the most scrupulous in fulfilling all his commitments, no matter how insignificant they are and even if they go against his interest or pleasure.</t3455> <t3456>No one fears more than he does causing pain or shattering an expectation, and he is the most incapable of selfishness of anyone I know.</t3456> <t3457>Yes, Edward, it is so and I will say so.</t3457> <t3458>What! Are you never going to allow yourself to be praised?</t3458> <t3459>Then you cannot be my friend, for those who accept my love and esteem must submit to my most open praises.</t3459>
<t3460>The content of his praises in the current case, however, was particularly inadequate to the feelings of two-thirds of his audience, and for Edward, it was so discouraging that he soon got up to leave.</t3460>
<t3461>—You're leaving so soon! —said Marianne—.</t3461> <t3462>My dear Edward, you can't do this.</t3462>
<t3463>And taking him slightly to one side, he whispered his conviction that Lucy would not stay much longer.</t3463> <t3464>But even this incentive failed, because he persisted in leaving; and Lucy, who would have stayed longer than him even if his visit had lasted two hours, left shortly after as well.</t3464>
<t3465>—What brings her here so often! —said Marianne as soon as she left—.</t3465> <t3466>How could she not realize that we wanted her to leave! What a nuisance for Edward!</t3466>
<t3467>—And why?</t3467> <t3468>We are all friends with him, and it is Lucy whom he has known the longest.</t3468> <t3469>It is natural that he would want to see her as much as he wants to see us.</t3469>
<t3470>Marianne stared at her intently and said:</t3470>
<t3471>—You know, Elinor, this is the kind of thing I can't stand to hear.</t3471> <t3472>If you say it just so someone will contradict you, as I imagine must be the case, you should remember that I would be the last person in the world to do so.</t3472> <t3473>I can't lower myself to be tricked into making statements that no one really wants.</t3473>
<t3474>With this, she left the room, and Elinor did not dare to follow her to say anything more, for bound as she was by the promise made to Lucy to keep her secret, she could not give Marianne any information that might convince her; and however painful the consequences of allowing her to remain in error, she was obliged to accept them.</t3474> <t3475>All she could hope for was that Edward would not often expose her, nor himself, to the discomfort of having to listen to Marianne's misguided displays of affection, nor to the reiteration of any other aspects of the hardships that had accompanied their last meeting... and this last wish, she could fully trust would be fulfilled.</t3475>
<t3476>CHAPTER XXXVI</t3476>
<t3477>A few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the world that the wife of Thomas Palmer, Esq., had given birth without complications to a son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least for all the close acquaintances who were already aware of the news.</t3477>
<t3478>This event, of great importance for Mrs. Jennings' happiness, caused a temporary alteration in the distribution of her time and similarly affected the commitments of her young friends; for, as she wished to be with Charlotte as much as possible, she went to see her every morning as soon as she dressed, and did not return until dusk; and the Misses Dashwood, at the special request of the Middletons, spent the whole day in Conduit Street.</t3478> <t3479>If it had been for their own comfort, they would have preferred to stay, at least during the mornings, at Mrs. Jennings' house; but this was not something that could be imposed against the wishes of everyone.</t3479> <t3480>Their hours were then transferred to Lady Middleton and the two Misses Steele, for whom the value of their company was as scarce as the eagerness with which they pretended to seek it.</t3480>
<t3481>The Dashwoods were too lucid to be good company for the former; and for the latter, they were a source of envy, as they considered them intruders in their territories, participants in the kindness they wished to monopolize.</t3481> <t3482>Although nothing could be more courteous than Lady Middleton's treatment of Elinor and Marianne, she did not like them at all.</t3482> <t3483>Since they did not flatter her or her children, she could not believe they were of good nature; and as they were fond of reading, she imagined them to be satirical: perhaps she did not know exactly what it meant to be satirical, but that was of no importance.</t3483> <t3484>In common language, it implied a censure, and she applied it without much care.</t3484>
<t3485>Their presence constrained both Lady Middleton and Lucy.</t3485> <t3486>They restricted the leisure of one and the occupation of the other.</t3486> <t3487>Lady Middleton felt embarrassed in front of them for doing nothing; and Lucy feared they would despise her for offering the flattery she usually prided herself on devising and administering.</t3487> <t3488>Miss Steele was the least affected of the three by the presence of Elinor and Marianne, and it only depended on them for her to fully accept them.</t3488> <t3489>It would have sufficed for one of the two to give her a complete and detailed account of everything that had happened between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, for her to feel amply rewarded for the sacrifice of yielding them the best spot by the fireplace after dinner, a gesture that the arrival of the young ladies demanded.</t3489> <t3490>But this conciliatory offer was not granted to her, for although she often expressed pity for her sister in front of Elinor, and more than once dropped a reflection on the —inconstancy of suitors in front of Marianne, it produced no effect beyond a look of indifference from the former or of displeasure from the latter.</t3490> <t3491>With even less effort, they could have won her friendship.</t3491> <t3492>If only they had teased her about Reverend Davies!</t3492> <t3493>But they were as unwilling as the others to please her, that if Sir John dined out, she could spend the entire day without hearing any other joke on the matter except those she kindly directed at herself.</t3493>
<t3494>All these jealousies and disappointments, however, went completely unnoticed by Mrs. Jennings, who believed that being together was something the girls enjoyed; and so, every night she congratulated her young friends for having escaped the company of a foolish old woman for so long.</t3494> <t3495>Sometimes she joined them at Sir John's and other times at her own house; but wherever she went, she always arrived in excellent spirits, full of joy and importance, attributing Charlotte's well-being to the care she had lavished on her and ready to give them such an exact and detailed report of her daughter's condition that only Miss Steele's curiosity could desire.</t3495> <t3496>There was one thing that troubled her, and she complained about it daily.</t3496> <t3497>Mr. Palmer persisted in the opinion so widespread among his sex, but so unpaternal, that all newborns were the same; and although she perceived with complete clarity at different times the most astonishing resemblance between this child and each of his relatives on both sides, there was no way to convince his father of it, nor to make him recognize that he was not exactly like any other creature of the same age; she couldn't even get him to admit the simple statement that he was the most beautiful child in the world.</t3497>
<t3498>I now come to the tale of a misfortune that befell Mrs. John Dashwood around this time.</t3498> <t3499>It happened that during the first visit made to her by her two sisters-in-law along with Mrs. Jennings in Harley Street, another acquaintance of hers arrived unexpectedly, a circumstance that, in itself, seemingly could not cause her any harm.</t3499> <t3500>But as long as people let their imagination run wild to form erroneous judgments about our conduct and judge us based on mere appearances, our happiness will always be, to a certain extent, at the mercy of chance.</t3500> <t3501>On this occasion, the lady who had arrived last let her fancy so far exceed the truth and probability, that merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods and understanding that they were Mr. Dashwood's sisters, led her to immediately conclude that they were staying in Harley Street; and this misinterpretation resulted, one or two days later, in invitation cards for them, as well as for their brother and sister-in-law, to a small musical evening at her house.</t3501> <t3502>The consequence of this was that Mrs. John Dashwood had to endure not only the great inconvenience of sending her carriage to fetch the Miss Dashwoods, but worse still, she had to bear all the displeasure of seeming to show them some attention: who could assure her that they would not expect to go out with her a second time?</t3502> <t3503>It is true that she would always have the power to thwart their expectations.</t3503> <t3504>But that was not enough, because when people persist in a course of conduct they know to be wrong, they feel aggrieved when something better is expected of them.</t3504>
<t3505>Marianne, meanwhile, found herself so gradually led to accept going out every day, that it had become indifferent to her whether she went somewhere or not; she prepared silently and mechanically for each of the evening engagements, though without expecting any amusement from them, and very often without knowing until the last moment where they would take her.</t3505>
<t3506>She had become so indifferent to her clothing and appearance that in all the time she spent on her grooming, she did not pay them even half the attention that Miss Steele gave them in the first five minutes they were together after she was ready.</t3506> <t3507>Nothing escaped her meticulous observation and broad curiosity; she saw everything and asked about everything; she was not satisfied until she knew the price of every part of Marianne's dress; she could have calculated how many outfits Marianne had better than Marianne herself; and she did not lose hope of discovering, before they parted ways, how much Marianne spent weekly on laundry and how much she had annually for her personal expenses.</t3507> <t3508>Moreover, the impertinence of this type of scrutiny was generally crowned with a compliment that, although it pretended to be an addition to the rest of the flattery, was received by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for, after being subjected to an examination that covered the value and make of her dress, the color of her shoes, and her hairstyle, she was almost certain to hear that “in her opinion, she looked most elegant, and she would bet that she was going to make many conquests.”</t3508>
<t3509>With these spirited words, Marianne was seen off on this occasion as she headed towards her brother's carriage, which they were ready to board five minutes after it arrived at their door, punctuality not very pleasing to her sister-in-law, who had preceded them to her friend's house and was expecting some delay from the young women that might inconvenience her or her coachman.</t3509>
<t3510>The events of that night were nothing out of the ordinary.</t3510> <t3511>The gathering, like all musical evenings, included a good number of people who found real pleasure in the show, and many more who did not; and, as always, the performers were, in their own opinion and that of their close friends, the best private concert musicians in England.</t3511>
<t3512>Since Elinor had no musical talents, nor pretended to have them, she diverted her gaze from the grand piano without much hesitation whenever she wished to do so, and without being hindered by the presence of a harp and a cello, she looked at any other object in the room to her liking.</t3512> <t3513>In one of these wandering glances, she saw in the group of young people the very same person from whom they had heard an entire lecture on toothpick cases at Gray's.</t3513> <t3514>Soon after, she saw him looking at her and speaking to her brother with great familiarity; and she had just decided that she would find out his name from the latter, when both approached her and Mr. Dashwood introduced him as Mr. Robert Ferrars.</t3514>
<t3515>He addressed her with easy courtesy and tilted his head in a nod that made it as clear as words would have, that he was exactly the braggart Lucy had described.</t3515> <t3516>It would have been fortunate for her if her affection for Edward depended less on his own merits than on the merits of his closest relatives.</t3516> <t3517>For in such circumstances, her brother's nod would have given the final touch to what her mother and sister's ill temper had begun.</t3517> <t3518>But while she pondered with wonder the difference between the two young men, it did not occur to her that the emptiness and presumption of one would take away all benevolence of judgment towards the modesty and worth of the other.</t3518> <t3519>Of course they were different, Robert explained while describing himself during the quarter of an hour conversation they had; referring to his brother, he lamented the extreme gaucherie that, in his true opinion, prevented him from mingling in good society, attributing it impartially and generously much less to an innate flaw than to the misfortune of having been educated by a private tutor; whereas in his case, though probably without any special natural or material superiority, simply because he had enjoyed the advantages of private education, he was as well equipped as anyone to venture into the world.</t3519>
<t3520>—By my faith —he added—, I believe that's what it's all about, and I often tell my mother so when she laments about it.</t3520> <t3521>“My dear lady,” I always say to her, “you mustn't keep worrying.</t3521> <t3522>The damage is already irreparable, and it has been entirely your doing.</t3522> <t3523>Why did you let yourself be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to place Edward in the hands of a private tutor at the most critical moment of his life?</t3523> <t3524>If only you had sent him to Westminster as you did with me, instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's establishment, all this would have been avoided.”</t3524> <t3525>That's how I always consider this whole matter, and my mother is completely convinced of her mistake.</t3525>
<t3526>Elinor did not contradict his opinion, since, beyond what she believed about the advantages of private education, she could not look with any kind of favor upon Edward's stay with Mr. Pratt's family.</t3526>
<t3527>—I believe you live in Devonshire —was his next observation—, in a country cottage near Dawlish.</t3527>
<t3528>Elinor corrected him regarding the location, and he seemed surprised that anyone could live in Devonshire without living near Dawlish.</t3528> <t3529>He granted, however, his most enthusiastic approval of the type of house in question.</t3529>
<t3530>—For my part —he said—, I am fascinated by country houses; they always have so much comfort, so much elegance.</t3530> <t3531>And, I promise, if I had some extra money, I would buy a small piece of land and build one, near London, where I could go at any time, gather a few friends around me and be happy.</t3531> <t3532>To anyone thinking of building something, I advise them to build a small country house.</t3532> <t3533>A friend, Lord Courtland, approached me a few days ago with the purpose of seeking my advice, and he presented me with three projects by Bonomi.</t3533> <t3534>6 I had to choose the best of them.</t3534> <t3535>“My dear Courtland,” I said immediately, throwing all three into the fire, “do not accept any of them, and by all means build yourself a small country house.”</t3535> <t3536>And I think that said it all.</t3536> <t3537>Some think that there would be no comforts, no spaciousness, but they are completely wrong.</t3537> <t3538>Last month I was at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford.</t3538> <t3539>Lady Elliott wanted to host a ball.</t3539> <t3540>“But, how to do it?” she said to me.</t3540> <t3541>“My dear Ferrars, please tell me how to organize it.</t3541> <t3542>There is not a single room in this little house where ten couples can fit, and where can dinner be served?”</t3542> <t3543>I immediately noticed that there would be no difficulty in doing so, so I said to her: “My dear Lady Elliott, do not worry.</t3543> <t3544>The dining room can easily accommodate eighteen couples; card tables can be set up in the sitting room; the library can be opened to serve tea and other refreshments; and have dinner served in the drawing room.”</t3544> <t3545>Lady Elliott loved the idea.</t3545> <t3546>We measured the dining room and saw that it could accommodate exactly eighteen couples, and everything was arranged precisely according to my plan.</t3546> <t3547>In fact, then, you can see that it is enough to know how to manage to enjoy the same comforts in a small country house as in the largest mansion.</t3547>
<t3548>Elinor agreed with all of it, because she did not believe he deserved the compliment of a rational opposition.</t3548>
<t3549>Since John Dashwood enjoyed music as little as his eldest sister, he had also let his mind wander; and thus it was that an idea occurred to him that night, which he submitted for his wife's approval upon returning home.</t3549> <t3550>Reflecting on Mrs. Dennison's mistake in assuming that his sisters were staying with them had suggested to him how appropriate it would be to actually have them as guests while Mrs. Jennings' engagements kept her away from home.</t3550> <t3551>The expense would be insignificant, and the inconveniences not much more; and it was, in short, an attention that the delicacy of his conscience indicated as necessary to completely free himself from the promise made to his father.</t3551> <t3552>Fanny was startled by this proposal.</t3552>
<t3553>—I don't see how it could be done—, he said, without offending Lady Middleton, since they spend every day with her; otherwise, I would be very pleased to do it.</t3553> <t3554>You know well that I am always willing to give them all the attention I can, and this is demonstrated by the fact that I brought them with me tonight.</t3554> <t3555>But they are Lady Middleton's guests.</t3555> <t3556>How can I ask them to leave her?</t3556>
<t3557>Her husband, although with great humility, did not see that his objections were convincing.</t3557>
<t3558>—It has already been a week in this manner on Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton would not mind if they gave the same amount of days to such close relatives.</t3558>
<t3559>Fanny made a brief pause and then, with renewed vigor, said:</t3559>
<t3560>—My love, I would ask it of you with all my heart, if it were in my power to do so.</t3560> <t3561>But I had just decided for myself to ask the Misses Steele to spend a few days with me.</t3561> <t3562>They are very well-mannered and good young ladies; and I think we owe them this courtesy, considering how well their uncle treated Edward.</t3562> <t3563>You see, we can invite your sisters some other year; but the Misses Steele may not come back to the city again.</t3563> <t3564>I'm sure you will like them; in fact, you already know that you do like them, very much, and so does my mother; and Harry likes them so much!</t3564>
<t3565>Mr. Dashwood was convinced.</t3565> <t3566>He understood the necessity of inviting the Misses Steele immediately, while the decision to invite his sisters some other year eased his conscience; at the same time, however, he had the shrewd suspicion that another year would make the invitation unnecessary, as it would bring Elinor to town as the wife of Colonel Brandon, and Marianne as their guest.</t3566>
<t3567>Fanny, rejoicing in her escape and proud of the quick wit that had facilitated it, wrote to Lucy the next morning, requesting her company and that of her sister for a few days in Harley Street as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them.</t3567> <t3568>This was enough to make Lucy truly and reasonably happy.</t3568> <t3569>Mrs. Dashwood seemed to be personally arranging things in her favor, nurturing her hopes, favoring her intentions!</t3569> <t3570>Such an opportunity to be with Edward and his family was, above all, of the utmost importance to her interests; and the invitation, the most pleasing thing that could have happened to her feelings.</t3570> <t3571>It was an opportunity for which any gratitude seemed poor, and the speed with which it was taken advantage of seemed insufficient; and regarding the visit to Lady Middleton, which until that moment had had no precise limits,— it was suddenly discovered that it had always been intended to end in two more days.</t3571>
<t3572>When, ten minutes after receiving it, Elinor was shown the note, she had to share for the first time some of Lucy's expectations; such a display of unusual kindness, dispensed so soon after meeting, seemed to indicate that the goodwill towards Lucy originated from something more than mere spite towards her, and that time and proximity might come to support Lucy in all her desires.</t3572> <t3573>Her flattery had already subdued Lady Middleton's pride and found its way to the cold heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and such results increased the likelihood of even greater ones.</t3573>
<t3574>The Misses Steele moved to Harley Street, and everything that reached Elinor about their influence there made her more expectant of the event.</t3574> <t3575>Sir John, who visited them more than once, brought astounding news for everyone about the favor in which they were held.</t3575> <t3576>Mrs. Dashwood had never in her life met any young women as pleasant as them; she had given each of them a pincushion, made by some emigrant; she called Lucy by her first name, and did not know if she would ever be able to part from them.</t3576>
<t3577>CHAPTER XXXVII</t3577>
<t3578>Mrs. Palmer was feeling so well at the end of a fortnight that her mother felt it was no longer necessary to devote all her time to her; and contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, she ended this phase to return to her own home and her own habits, finding the Misses Dashwood very willing to resume the part they had played in them.</t3578>
<t3579>On the third or fourth day after having resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, just back from her daily visit to Mrs. Palmer, entered the room where Elinor was alone with such an air of urgent importance that Elinor prepared herself to hear something astonishing; and after giving her just enough time to form such an idea, she immediately began to substantiate it by saying:</t3579>
<t3580>—Heavens! My dear Miss Dashwood! Did you hear the news?</t3580>
<t3581>—No, ma'am.</t3581> <t3582>What is it about?</t3582>
<t3583>—Something so strange!</t3583> <t3584>But I will tell you everything soon.</t3584> <t3585>When I arrived at Mr. Palmer's place, I found Charlotte making a huge fuss over the child.</t3585> <t3586>She was sure he was very sick: he was crying and upset, and he was all covered in little spots.</t3586> <t3587>I then examined him closely, and "Heavens, dear!" I said to her.</t3587> <t3588>"It's nothing, just a rash," and the nanny said the same.</t3588> <t3589>But not Charlotte, she wasn't satisfied, so they sent for Mr. Donovan; and luckily he had just arrived from Harley Street, so he went immediately, and as soon as he saw the child he said the same as us, that it was nothing but a rash, and then Charlotte calmed down.</t3589> <t3590>And then, just as he was leaving, it came to my mind, and I don't know how I thought of it, but it occurred to me to ask him if there was any news.</t3590> <t3591>And then he put on that affected and silly smile, and pretended a whole air of seriousness, as if he knew this and that, until he finally whispered: "For fear that some unpleasant report might reach the young ladies under your care about the indisposition of their sister-in-law, I think it advisable to say that, in my opinion, there is no cause for alarm; I trust Mrs. Dashwood will recover perfectly."</t3591>
<t3592>—What! Is Fanny sick?</t3592>
<t3593>—It's the same thing I told you, dear.</t3593> <t3594>“Heavens!”, I said to her.</t3594> <t3595>“Is Mrs. Dashwood ill?”</t3595> <t3596>And there it all came to light; and in a few words, as far as I could gather, it seems to be this: Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man with whom I used to joke with you (although, as things have turned out, I am now terribly glad that there was indeed nothing of that sort), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it appears, has been engaged for more than a year to my cousin Lucy!</t3596> <t3597>There you have it, dear!</t3597> <t3598>And without anyone knowing a word about it, except Nancy!</t3598> <t3599>Would you have believed it possible?</t3599> <t3600>It's not at all strange that they like each other, but that things progressed so far between them, and without anyone suspecting!</t3600> <t3601>That is indeed strange!</t3601> <t3602>I never saw them together, or I would surely have discovered it immediately.</t3602> <t3603>Well, and then they kept all this very secret for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother nor your sister-in-law suspected anything about the whole matter... until this very morning, poor Nancy, who, as you know, is a very well-intentioned creature, but nothing in the realm of conspiracies, blurted it all out.</t3603> <t3604>“Heavens!”, she thought to herself, “they are so fond of Lucy, they surely won't oppose it”; and so, she came and went to her sister-in-law, Miss Dashwood, who was alone embroidering her tapestry, without imagining what was coming... because she had just told her brother, barely five minutes ago, that she was planning to arrange a marriage for Edward with the daughter of some lord, I don't remember which.</t3604> <t3605>So you can imagine the blow it was to her vanity and pride.</t3605> <t3606>She immediately had a hysterical fit, with such screams that they even reached the ears of her brother, who was in his own study downstairs, thinking of writing a letter to his steward in the country.</t3606> <t3607>Then he flew upstairs and there was a terrible scene, because by then Lucy had joined them, without dreaming of what was happening.</t3607> <t3608>Poor creature!</t3608> <t3609>I pity her.</t3609> <t3610>And believe me, I think they behaved very harshly with her; her sister-in-law scolded her in a fury, until she fainted.</t3610> <t3611>Nancy, for her part, fell to her knees and cried bitterly; and her brother paced the room saying he didn't know what to do.</t3611> <t3612>Mrs. Dashwood said the young women could not stay a minute longer in the house, and her brother also had to kneel to convince her to let them stay at least until they had packed their clothes.</t3612> <t3613>And then she had another hysterical fit, and he was so scared that he sent for Mr. Donovan, and Mr. Donovan found the house all in commotion.</t3613> <t3614>The carriage was ready at the door to take my poor cousins away, and they were just getting in when he came out; poor Lucy, he told me, was in such bad condition that she could barely walk; and Nancy was almost as bad.</t3614> <t3615>Let me tell you that I have no patience with her sister-in-law; and I hope with all my heart that they get married, despite her opposition.</t3615> <t3616>God!</t3616> <t3617>How poor Mr. Edward will feel when he finds out!</t3617> <t3618>That they have treated his beloved so badly!</t3618> <t3619>Because they say he loves her immensely, with all his might.</t3619> <t3620>I wouldn't be surprised if he felt the greatest passion!</t3620> <t3621>And Mr. Donovan thinks the same.</t3621> <t3622>We talked a lot about this; and the best part is that he went back to Harley Street, to be on hand when they told Mrs. Ferrars, because they sent for her as soon as my cousins left the house and her sister-in-law was sure she would also become hysterical; and she well might, for all I care.</t3622> <t3623>I have no compassion for any of them.</t3623> <t3624>I have never known people who make such a fuss over money and grandeur.</t3624> <t3625>There is no reason in the world why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; I am sure that Mrs. Ferrars can very well afford to look after her son; and although Lucy personally has almost nothing, she knows better than anyone how to make the most of anything; and I would say that if Mrs. Ferrars assigned her even five hundred pounds a year, she could make it look the same as someone else would with eight hundred.</t3625> <t3626>Heavens!</t3626> <t3627>How comfortably they could live in a house like yours, or a little bigger, with two maids and two servants; and I think I could help them with the maids, because mine, Betty, has an unemployed sister who would suit them perfectly!</t3627>
<t3628>Mrs. Jennings concluded her speech, and as Elinor had enough time to arrange her thoughts, she was able to respond and make the comments that the topic in question was supposed to elicit from her.</t3628> <t3629>Content to know that she was not suspected of having any particular interest in him and that Mrs. Jennings (as it had seemed to her several times lately) no longer imagined her to be fond of Edward; and happy above all that Marianne was not there, she felt very capable of discussing the matter without being disturbed and giving an impartial opinion, as she believed, on the conduct of each of those involved.</t3629>
<t3630>Elinor did not really know what her own expectations were in this regard, although she seriously tried to dismiss the idea that it could end in any way other than with the marriage of Edward and Lucy.</t3630> <t3631>She was indeed anxious to know what Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, although there was little doubt about her nature, and even more anxious to know how Edward would behave.</t3631> <t3632>She felt quite a bit of compassion for him; for Lucy, very little... and even that took some effort; for the rest, none.</t3632>
<t3633>Since Mrs. Jennings did not change the subject, Elinor soon realized that it would be necessary to prepare Marianne to discuss it.</t3633> <t3634>Without wasting any time, she had to disillusion her, inform her of the truth, and ensure that she listened to others' comments without revealing any concern for her sister, nor any resentment towards Edward.</t3634>
<t3635>Painful was the task that Elinor had to fulfill.</t3635> <t3636>She was going to have to destroy what she truly believed to be her sister's main solace: giving details about Edward that she feared would make him lose favor forever in Marianne's eyes; and making her, due to the similarity between their situations, which in Marianne's vivid imagination would seem enormous, relive her own disappointment once more.</t3636> <t3637>But as unpleasant as such a task had to be, it had to be done and, consequently, Elinor hurried to do it.</t3637>
<t3638>She was far from wanting to dwell too much on her own feelings or to show that she was suffering greatly, unless the self-control she had practiced since the moment she learned of Edward's engagement indicated that it would be useful in front of Marianne.</t3638> <t3639>Her account was clear and straightforward; and although it could not be devoid of emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation or outbursts of grief.</t3639> <t3640>That was more fitting for the listener, for Marianne listened to everything in horror and cried incessantly.</t3640> <t3641>Generally, Elinor had to console others when she was as distressed as when they were; and thus, she comforted Marianne by offering her the certainty of her own tranquility and a vigorous defense of Edward against all charges, except that of imprudence.</t3641>
<t3642>But Marianne did not believe any of Elinor's arguments for quite some time.</t3642> <t3643>Edward seemed like a second Willoughby; and if Elinor admitted, as she had.</t3643> <t3644>done, that she had indeed loved him very sincerely, how could she feel less than her!</t3644> <t3645>As for Lucy Steele, she considered her so absolutely despicable, so completely incapable of attracting any sensible man, that they were not going to be able to convince her first to believe, and then to forgive, that Edward had ever felt any affection for her.</t3645> <t3646>She did not even admit that it had been something natural; and Elinor abandoned her efforts, leaving it to some future day to convince her of how things really were, the only thing that might eventually convince her: a deeper understanding of humanity.</t3646>
<t3647>In his first attempt at communication, he had not been able to go beyond establishing the fact of the engagement and the time it had existed.</t3647> <t3648>Then Marianne's emotions burst forth, putting an end to any order in the description of the details; and for some moments, all that could be done was to calm her distress, reassure her fears, and combat her resentment.</t3648> <t3649>The first question she asked, which paved the way for new details, was:</t3649>
<t3650>—And how long have you known, Elinor?</t3650> <t3651>Has he written to you?</t3651>
<t3652>—I have known it for four months.</t3652> <t3653>When Lucy first went to Barton Park last November, she spoke to me privately about her engagement.</t3653>
<t3654>In response to these words, Marianne expressed with her eyes what her lips could not formulate.</t3654> <t3655>After a moment of astonished silence, she exclaimed:</t3655>
<t3656>—Four months! Have you known for four months?</t3656>
<t3657>Elinor confirmed it.</t3657>
<t3658>—How!</t3658> <t3659>While you were taking care of me when I was engulfed in pain, your heart was bearing all of this? And I reproached you for being happy!</t3659>
<t3660>—It was not convenient for you to know at that moment how opposed to that my feelings were.</t3660>
<t3661>—Four months! —Marianne exclaimed again—.</t3661> <t3662>And you so calm, so cheerful!</t3662> <t3663>What have you been holding on to?</t3663>
<t3664>—In feeling that I was fulfilling my duty.</t3664> <t3665>My promise to Lucy imposed secrecy on me.</t3665> <t3666>I owed it to her, then, to avoid any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends to spare them a worry on my account that would not be within my power to resolve.</t3666>
<t3667>The above seemed to shake Marianne strongly.</t3667>
<t3668>—I have often wanted to free you and mom from the deception —added Elinor—, and once or twice I have tried to do so; but without betraying the trust that had been placed in me, I would never have convinced you.</t3668>
<t3669>—Four months! And you still loved him!</t3669>
<t3670>—Yes, but I did not love only him; and as long as I cared so much about the well-being of other people, I was glad to spare them the knowledge of how much I was suffering.</t3670> <t3671>Now I can think and talk about it all without great emotion.</t3671> <t3672>I would not want you to suffer because of me; because I assure you that I no longer suffer excessively.</t3672> <t3673>I have many things to lean on.</t3673> <t3674>I do not believe I caused this disappointment through any imprudence of mine and I have borne it, as much as possible, without spreading it around me.</t3674> <t3675>I absolve Edward of any essentially improper conduct.</t3675> <t3676>I wish him much happiness; and I am so sure that he will always fulfill his duty that, although he may now harbor some regret, he will be happy in the long run.</t3676> <t3677>Lucy is not lacking in judgment, and that is the foundation on which everything good can be built.</t3677> <t3678>And after all, Marianne, after how fascinating the idea of a unique and permanent love can be and how much happiness that depends entirely on one particular person can be pondered, things are not like that... it is not appropriate... it is not possible for them to be so.</t3678> <t3679>Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in appearance and intelligence to half the people of her sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought anyone else superior to her.</t3679>
<t3680>—If that is how you think —said Marianne—, if the loss of what is most valuable can be so easily compensated, your composure and self-control are perhaps a little less astonishing.</t3680> <t3681>They are closer to what I can understand.</t3681>
<t3682>—I understand you.</t3682> <t3683>You suppose that my feelings have never been very strong.</t3683> <t3684>For four months, Marianne, all this has weighed on my mind without being able to talk about it to anyone in the world; knowing that, when they found out, you and my mother would be enormously unhappy, and yet prevented from preparing you for it in the slightest.</t3684> <t3685>It was told to me... somehow it was imposed on me by the very person whose oldest commitment shattered all my expectations; and it was told to me, I thought, with an air of triumph.</t3685> <t3686>I had, therefore, to overcome this person's suspicions by trying to appear indifferent where my interest was deepest.</t3686> <t3687>And it hasn't been just once; over and over again I have had to listen to their hopes and joys.</t3687> <t3688>I have known myself separated from Edward forever, without knowing of even one circumstance that would make me wish the union less.</t3688> <t3689>Nothing has made him less worthy of appreciation, nor anything that assures that I am indifferent to him.</t3689> <t3690>I have had to fight against his sister's ill will and his mother's insolence, and I have suffered the punishments of loving someone without enjoying its advantages.</t3690> <t3691>And all this has been happening at times when, as you know so well, it was not the only pain that afflicted me.</t3691> <t3692>If you can believe me capable of feeling at any time... you could surely suppose that I have suffered now.</t3692> <t3693>The calm measure with which I have now come to take what happened, the comfort I have been willing to accept, have been the product of a painful effort; they did not come by themselves; at first, I did not count on them to relieve my spirit... no, Marianne.</t3693> <t3694>Then, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing... not even what I owed to my dearest friends... would have prevented me from openly showing that I was very unhappy.</t3694>
<t3695>Marianne was completely dismayed.</t3695>
<t3696>—Oh, Elinor! —she exclaimed—.</t3696> <t3697>You have made me hate myself forever.</t3697> <t3698>How heartless I have been to you!</t3698> <t3699>To you, who have been my only comfort, who have accompanied me in all my misery, who seemed to suffer only for me!</t3699> <t3700>Is this how I thank you?</t3700> <t3701>Is this the only reward I can offer you?</t3701> <t3702>Because your worth overwhelmed me, I have been trying to ignore it.</t3702>
<t3703>This confession was followed by the most tender caresses.</t3703> <t3704>Given the state of mind she was in now, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her all the promises she required; and at her request, Marianne committed to never touch upon the subject with the slightest appearance of bitterness; to be with Lucy without showing the slightest increase in the displeasure she felt for her; and even, to see Edward himself, if chance brought them together, without diminishing her usual cordiality in the least.</t3704> <t3705>All were great concessions, but when Marianne felt she had done some harm, nothing she could do to make amends seemed too much.</t3705>
<t3706>She perfectly fulfilled her promise to be discreet.</t3706> <t3707>She paid attention to everything Mrs. Jennings had to say on the subject without changing color, did not disagree with her on anything, and was heard to say “Yes, ma'am” three times.</t3707> <t3708>Her only reaction upon hearing her praise Lucy was to change seats, and when Mrs. Jennings mentioned Edward's affection, her throat merely tightened.</t3708> <t3709>So many advances in her sister's heroism made Elinor feel capable of facing anything.</t3709>
<t3710>The next morning put them to the test again with the visit of his brother, who arrived with a very serious demeanor to discuss the terrible matter and bring them news of his wife.</t3710>
<t3711>—You must have heard, I suppose —he told them with great solemnity, as soon as he had sat down—, about the unusual discovery that took place under our roof yesterday.</t3711>
<t3712>Everyone nodded; it seemed like a moment too dreadful for words.</t3712>
<t3713>—My wife —he continued— has suffered terribly.</t3713> <t3714>Mrs. Ferrars too... in short, it has been a very difficult and painful scene; but I trust that we will weather the storm without any of us being too downcast.</t3714> <t3715>Poor Fanny!</t3715> <t3716>She had hysterical fits all day yesterday.</t3716> <t3717>But I wouldn't want to alarm you too much.</t3717> <t3718>Donovan says there is nothing too important to fear; she has a good constitution and is capable of facing anything.</t3718> <t3719>She has borne it with the fortitude of an angel!</t3719> <t3720>She says she will never think well of anyone again; and it's no wonder, after being deceived in that way!</t3720> <t3721>To receive so much ingratitude after showing so much kindness and giving so much trust.</t3721> <t3722>It was out of the generosity of her heart that she invited these young women to her house; simply because she thought they deserved some attention, that they were harmless and well-educated girls and would be pleasant company; because on the other hand, we both greatly wished to have invited you and Marianne to stay with us, while the kind friend where you are now staying attended to her daughter.</t3722> <t3723>And now to be rewarded like this! “With all my heart,” says poor Fanny in her affectionate manner, “I wish we had invited your sisters instead of them.”</t3723>
<t3724>He paused at this moment, waiting for the customary thanks; and having received them, he continued.</t3724>
<t3725>—What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered when Fanny told her is indescribable.</t3725> <t3726>While she, with the most sincere affection, had been planning the most suitable union for him, how could she have supposed that all the time he had been engaged to someone else!</t3726> <t3727>It would not have crossed her mind to suspect such a thing!</t3727> <t3728>And if she had suspected the existence of any predisposition on his part, she would not have looked in that direction.</t3728> <t3729>"There, I assure you," she said, "I would have felt safe."</t3729> <t3730>It has been a true agony for her.</t3730> <t3731>We then discussed among ourselves what should be done, and finally she decided to send for Edward.</t3731> <t3732>He came.</t3732> <t3733>But it is very sad for me to tell you what followed.</t3733> <t3734>Everything that Mrs. Ferrars could say to induce him to end the engagement, reinforced, as you can imagine, by my arguments and Fanny's pleas, proved useless.</t3734> <t3735>Duty, affection, he disregarded it all.</t3735> <t3736>I had never thought that Edward could be so obstinate, so insensitive.</t3736> <t3737>His mother explained to him the generous plans she had for him, in case he married Miss Morton; she told him she would transfer the Norfolk properties to him, which, after deducting contributions, yield a good thousand pounds a year; she even offered, when things became desperate, to raise it to twelve hundred; and on the contrary, if he persisted in this disadvantageous union, she described the inevitable hardships that would accompany his marriage.</t3737> <t3738>She insisted that the two thousand pounds he personally possesses would be all his assets; he would never see her again; and she would be so far from lending him the slightest help that if he were to take up any profession with a view to obtaining a better income, she would do everything in her power to prevent him from progressing in it.</t3738>
<t3739>Faced with this, Marianne, in a fit of indignation, clapped her hands exclaiming:</t3739>
<t3740>—Blessed God! How is it possible!</t3740>
<t3741>—It may well surprise you, Marianne —replied her brother—, the obstinacy capable of resisting arguments like those.</t3741> <t3742>Your exclamation is absolutely natural.</t3742>
<t3743>Marianne was about to reply, but she remembered her promises and refrained.</t3743>
<t3744>—All these efforts, however —he continued—, were in vain.</t3744> <t3745>Edward said very little; but when he spoke, he —did so in the most determined manner.</t3745> <t3746>Nothing could convince him to give up his commitment.</t3746> <t3747>He would fulfill it, no matter the cost.</t3747>
<t3748>—Then —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings with brusque sincerity, unable to remain silent any longer—, he has acted like an honest man.</t3748> <t3749>I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I would have thought he was a scoundrel.</t3749> <t3750>This matter concerns me somewhat, just as it does you, because Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is no better girl in the world, nor one more deserving of a good husband.</t3750>
<t3751>John Dashwood was beside himself—with astonishment; but he was naturally calm, not prone to irritation, and never intended to offend anyone, especially not anyone with money.</t3751> <t3752>Thus, he replied without any resentment:</t3752>
<t3753>—Under no circumstances would I speak disrespectfully of any of your relatives, madam.</t3753> <t3754>Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young lady, but in the current case, you must know that the union is impossible.</t3754> <t3755>And to have secretly engaged herself to a young man under the care of his uncle, especially the son of a woman of such great fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, all things considered, a little extraordinary.</t3755> <t3756>In short, it is not my intention to discredit the behavior of anyone you hold dear, Mrs. Jennings.</t3756> <t3757>We all wish your cousin the greatest happiness, and Mrs. Ferrars' conduct has at all times been what any good and conscientious mother would adopt in similar circumstances.</t3757> <t3758>She has behaved with dignity and generosity.</t3758> <t3759>Edward has cast his own lot, and I fear it will turn out badly for him.</t3759>
<t3760>Marianne expressed with a sigh a similar fear; and Elinor's heart sank at the thought of Edward's feelings as he defied his mother's threats for a woman who could not reward him.</t3760>
<t3761>—Well, sir —said Mrs. Jennings—, and how did it all end?</t3761>
<t3762>—I regret to say, madam, that with the most unfortunate rupture: Edward has lost his mother's favor forever.</t3762> <t3763>He left his house yesterday, but I do not know where he has gone or if he is still in the city; because, of course, we cannot ask anything.</t3763>
<t3764>—Poor young man! And what will become of him?</t3764>
<t3765>—Yes, certainly, madam.</t3765> <t3766>How sad it is to think about.</t3766> <t3767>Born with the expectation of so much wealth!</t3767> <t3768>I cannot imagine a more deplorable situation.</t3768> <t3769>The interest on two thousand pounds, how is a person to live on that!</t3769> <t3770>And when, in addition, one thinks that, if it hadn't been for his own folly, in three more months he would have received two thousand five hundred pounds annually (since Miss Morton possesses thirty thousand pounds), I cannot imagine a more disastrous situation.</t3770> <t3771>We all must pity him; and even more so considering that helping him is completely beyond our reach.</t3771>
<t3772>—Poor young man! —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings. I assure you that I would very gladly provide him with lodging and food in my house; and I would tell him so, if I could see him.</t3772> <t3773>It is not right that he has to bear all the expenses alone now, living in inns and taverns.</t3773>
<t3774>Elinor thanked her inwardly for her kindness towards Edward, although she couldn't help but smile at the manner in which it was expressed.</t3774>
<t3775>—If only he had done for himself —said John Dashwood— what his friends were willing to do for him, he would now be in the situation that befits him and nothing would be lacking.</t3775> <t3776>But as things stand, helping him is beyond anyone's reach.</t3776> <t3777>And there is something else brewing against him, worse than everything before: his mother has decided, driven by a very understandable state of mind, to immediately assign to Robert the same properties that, under the right conditions, would have been Edward's.</t3777> <t3778>I left her this morning with her lawyer, discussing this matter.</t3778>
<t3779>—Well! said Mrs. Jennings—, that is her revenge.</t3779> <t3780>Everyone does it in their own way.</t3780> <t3781>But I don't think I would take revenge by giving financial independence to one child because the other had annoyed me.</t3781>
<t3782>Marianne got up and left the room.</t3782>
<t3783>—Can there be anything more mortifying for a man's spirit —continued John— than to see his younger brother owning a property that could have been his? Poor Edward!</t3783> <t3784>I sincerely pity him.</t3784>
<t3785>After a few more minutes spent in the same kind of expansions, he ended his visit; and repeatedly assuring his sisters that there was no serious danger in Fanny's indisposition and that they therefore should not worry about her, he left, leaving the three ladies with unanimous feelings about the events of the moment, at least as far as the conduct of Mrs. Ferrars, the Dashwoods, and Edward was concerned.</t3785>
<t3786>Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as her brother left the room; and as her vehemence made Elinor's discretion impossible and Mrs. Jennings's unnecessary, the three of them joined in a very lively critique of the entire group.</t3786>
<t3787>CHAPTER XXXVIII</t3787>
<t3788>Mrs. Jennings warmly praised Edward's conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit.</t3788> <t3789>Only they knew how few were the incentives that might have tempted him to disobedience, and how little comfort, beyond the conscience of doing the right thing, would remain to him after the loss of his friends and fortune.</t3789> <t3790>Elinor took pride in his integrity; and Marianne forgave him all his offenses out of compassion for his punishment.</t3790> <t3791>But although having everything come to light restored the confidence that had always existed between them, it was not a subject on which either of them wished to dwell too much when they were alone.</t3791> <t3792>Elinor avoided it on principle, as she noticed how much it tended to become a fixed idea for her with Marianne's overly enthusiastic and positive certainties, that is, her belief that Edward still loved her, a thought from which she rather wished to detach herself; and Marianne's courage soon abandoned her when trying to converse on a subject that increasingly caused her greater dissatisfaction with herself, as it necessarily led her to compare Elinor's conduct with her own.</t3792>
<t3793>She felt the full weight of the comparison, but not as her sister had hoped, inciting her now to make an effort; she felt it with the pain of continuously reproaching herself, lamenting with enormous bitterness for never having made an effort before, but it only brought her the torture of penance without the hope of redemption.</t3793> <t3794>Her spirit had weakened to such a degree that she still felt incapable of any effort, and thus the only thing she achieved was to become more discouraged.</t3794>
<t3795>For one or two days, they had no further news about the affairs of Harley Street or Bartlett's Buildings.</t3795> <t3796>But although they already knew so much about the matter that Mrs. Jennings could have been sufficiently occupied spreading it without having to find out more, from the beginning she had decided to pay a visit of consolation and inspection to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but being hindered by more visits than usual had prevented her from fulfilling it in the elapsed time.</t3796>
<t3797>On the third day after having learned the details of the matter, the weather was so pleasant, such a beautiful Sunday, that many went to the Kensington Gardens, even though it was only the second week of March.</t3797> <t3798>Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were among them; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were back in town and lived in constant fear of encountering them, preferred to stay at home rather than venture to such a public place.</t3798>
<t3799>Shortly after arriving at the park, they were joined and followed by a close friend of Mrs. Jennings, to whom she directed all her conversation; Elinor did not regret this at all, as it allowed her to quietly dedicate herself to thinking.</t3799>
<t3800>She saw neither traces of the Willoughbys nor of Edward, and for a while, no one who, in one way or another, pleasantly or unpleasantly, was of interest to her.</t3800> <t3801>But eventually, and with some surprise on her part, she was approached by Miss Steele, who, though somewhat timid, expressed her delight at having met them, and at the very kind invitation of Mrs. Jennings, left her own group for a moment to join them.</t3801> <t3802>Immediately, Mrs. Jennings whispered to Elinor:</t3802>
<t3803>—Take everything out, dear.</t3803> <t3804>Miss Steele will tell you anything just by asking her.</t3804> <t3805>You see that I can't leave Mrs. Clarke.</t3805>
<t3806>Fortunately for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity, however, and also for Elinor's, Miss Steele recounted everything without needing to be asked, because otherwise they would not have found out anything.</t3806>
<t3807>—I am so glad to have found you —he said to Elinor, taking her familiarly by the arm—, because more than anything in the world I wanted to see you.</t3807> <t3808>—And then, lowering his voice—: I suppose Mrs. Jennings already knows everything.</t3808> <t3809>Is she angry?</t3809>
<t3810>—Absolutely not, I believe, with you.</t3810>
<t3811>—How nice.</t3811> <t3812>And Lady Middleton, is she angry?</t3812>
<t3813>—I don't see why I should be.</t3813>
<t3814>—I am terribly glad to hear it.</t3814> <t3815>Good heavens!</t3815> <t3816>I have had such a hard time with this!</t3816> <t3817>In my entire life, I had never seen Lucy so furious.</t3817> <t3818>First, she swore that she would never again fix any new headdress for me nor do anything else for me; but now she has calmed down, and we are as good friends as ever.</t3818> <t3819>Look, last night she made this bow for my hat and placed the feather.</t3819> <t3820>Now, you are going to laugh at me too.</t3820> <t3821>But, why shouldn't I wear pink ribbons?</t3821> <t3822>I don't care if it's the reverend's favorite color.</t3822> <t3823>For my part, I am sure I would never have known that he preferred it above all others, if it hadn't occurred to him to say so.</t3823> <t3824>My cousins have been teasing me so much!</t3824> <t3825>Believe me, sometimes I don't know what to do when I'm with them.</t3825>
<t3826>He had strayed into a topic on which Elinor had nothing to say, and thus soon deemed it convenient to see how to return to the first.</t3826>
<t3827>—Well, Miss Dashwood —his tone was triumphant—, people can say whatever they want about Mr. Ferrars deciding to break up with Lucy, because it's not true, you can believe me; and it's a shame that such hateful rumors are being spread.</t3827> <t3828>Whatever Lucy thinks about it, you know that no one had any reason to assert it as something certain.</t3828>
<t3829>—I assure you that I have not heard anyone insinuate such a thing, -said Elinor.</t3829>
<t3830>—Oh, really?</t3830> <t3831>But I know very well that they have said it, and more than one person; because Miss Godby told Miss Sparks that no one in their right mind could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, who owns a fortune of thirty thousand pounds, for Lucy Steele, who has nothing at all; and I heard it from Miss Sparks herself.</t3831> <t3832>And besides, my cousin Richard also said that he feared when it came time to lay the cards on the table, Mr. Ferrars would disappear; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I myself did not know what to believe; I thought to myself that Lucy considered him lost, for we left her brother's house on Wednesday and did not see him all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and we did not know what had become of him.</t3832> <t3833>At one point Lucy thought of writing to him, but then her spirit rebelled at the idea.</t3833> <t3834>Nevertheless, he appeared this morning, just as we were returning from church; and there we learned everything: how on Wednesday he had been asked to go to Harley Street and his mother and everyone else had spoken to him, and how he had declared before everyone that he only loved Lucy and that no, he would marry no one but Lucy.</t3834> <t3835>And how he had been so worried about what had happened, that upon leaving his mother's house he had mounted his horse and headed to some unknown place in the countryside; and how he had stayed at an inn all Thursday and Friday, to think about what to do.</t3835> <t3836>And after thinking the whole matter over and over, he said that it seemed to him that now that he had no fortune, that he had nothing at all, it would be wrong to ask Lucy to keep the engagement, because she would lose out, given that he only had two thousand pounds and no hope of anything more; and if he were to take holy orders, as he had sometimes thought of doing, he would get nothing but a parish, and how were they to live on that?</t3836> <t3837>He could not bear the thought that she would not be better off in life, so he implored her, if she cared even a little, to put an end to the whole matter immediately and let him fend for himself.</t3837> <t3838>I heard him say all this with absolute clarity.</t3838> <t3839>And it was completely for her sake, and thinking of her, not himself, that he spoke of ending the engagement.</t3839> <t3840>I can swear that he never said a word about being tired of her or wanting to marry Miss Morton or anything of the sort.</t3840> <t3841>But, in any case, Lucy did not want to listen to such kind words, and so she told him immediately (with much sweetness and love, you know, all that... Oh, one cannot repeat those things, you know)... she told him immediately that she had no intention of breaking the engagement, because she could live with him on nothing, and however little he had, she would be content with that, or something like that.</t3841> <t3842>Then he was overjoyed, and they talked for a while about what they should do, and they agreed that he should take orders immediately and that they should postpone their wedding until he could obtain a benefice.</t3842> <t3843>And just at that moment I could not keep listening, because my cousin called me from downstairs to tell me that Mrs. Richardson had arrived in her carriage and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was obliged to enter the room and interrupt them to ask Lucy if she wished to go, but she did not want to leave Edward; so I ran upstairs and put on a pair of silk stockings, and went with the Richardsons.</t3843>
<t3844>—I don't quite understand what you mean by interrupting them —said Elinor—; you were in the same room, weren't you?</t3844>
<t3845>—Of course not! Come on, Miss Dashwood!</t3845> <t3846>Do you think people speak words of love when someone else is present?</t3846> <t3847>But, how could you think that!</t3847> <t3848>I'm sure you know much more about that than I do —she said, laughing affectedly—.</t3848> <t3849>No, no; they were locked in the room, and all I heard was just by listening through the door.</t3849>
<t3850>—What! —exclaimed Elinor—.</t3850> <t3851>Have you been repeating things to me that you only found out by listening through the door?</t3851> <t3852>I regret not knowing this earlier, for I would never have accepted you communicating details of a conversation that you yourself should not have known.</t3852> <t3853>How could you act so wrongly towards your sister?</t3853>
<t3854>—But no!</t3854> <t3855>What problem could there be with that.</t3855> <t3856>I just stood by the door and listened to everything I could.</t3856> <t3857>And I am sure that Lucy would have done the same with me, because one or two years ago, when Martha Sharpe and I shared so many secrets, she had no qualms about hiding in a closet, or behind the fireplace screen, to listen to what we were talking about.</t3857>
<t3858>Elinor tried to change the subject, but it was impossible to keep Miss Steele away for more than a couple of minutes from what occupied the first place in her mind.</t3858>
<t3859>—Edward talks about going to Oxford soon —she said—, but for now he is staying at No... Pall Mall.</t3859> <t3860>What a bad person his mother is, isn't she? And his brother and sister-in-law weren't very kind either!</t3860> <t3861>But I'm not going to speak to you against them; and yet, they sent us home in their own carriage, which was more than I expected.</t3861> <t3862>And for my part, I was terrified that his sister-in-law would ask for the pincushions back that she had given us one or two days ago; but nothing was said about them, and I made sure to keep mine out of sight of the others.</t3862> <t3863>Edward says he has to settle some matters in Oxford, so he must go there for a while; and then, as soon as he gets a bishop, he will be ordained.</t3863> <t3864>I'm so curious to know which parish he will get!</t3864> <t3865>Good heavens! —she continued with a silly giggle—, I would bet my life that I know what my cousins will say when they find out.</t3865> <t3866>They will tell me to write to the reverend, to give Edward the parish of his new benefice.</t3866> <t3867>I know they will; but I tell you that for nothing in the world would I do such a thing.</t3867> <t3868>“Oh!”, I will tell them directly, “how can you think such a thing.</t3868> <t3869>Me writing to the reverend... please!”</t3869>
<t3870>—Well —said Elinor—, it is a relief to be prepared for the worst.</t3870> <t3871>She already has her answer ready.</t3871>
<t3872>Miss Steele was going to continue with the same topic, but the proximity of the group she had come with forced her to change it.</t3872>
<t3873>—Oh! Here come the Richardsons.</t3873> <t3874>I had much more to tell you, but I have to go meet them now.</t3874> <t3875>I assure you they are very distinguished people.</t3875> <t3876>He makes a lot of money, and they have their own carriage.</t3876> <t3877>I don't have time to speak to Mrs. Jennings personally, but please tell her that I am very happy to know she is not angry with us, and the same goes for Lady Middleton; and if anything were to happen that required you and your sister to leave, and Mrs. Jennings wanted company, rest assured that we would be happy to stay with her for as long as she wished.</t3877> <t3878>I suppose Lady Middleton will not invite us again this season.</t3878> <t3879>Goodbye; I regret that Miss Marianne was not here.</t3879> <t3880>Give her my most affectionate regards.</t3880> <t3881>Oh, you are wearing your polka dot muslin dress!</t3881> <t3882>Weren't you afraid of tearing it?</t3882>
<t3883>Such was her concern upon parting, for after having said it, she only had time to pay her respects and bid farewell to Mrs. Jennings before Mrs. Richardson claimed her company; and thus, Elinor was left with information that would serve as fodder for her reflections for some time, although she had learned almost nothing that she had not already foreseen and supposed by herself.</t3883> <t3884>The marriage of Edward and Lucy was as firmly decided and the date on which it would take place as absolutely uncertain as she believed it would be; as she had expected, everything depended on that position which, up to that moment, seemed to have no possibility of being obtained.</t3884>
<t3885>As soon as they were back in the carriage, Mrs. Jennings became eager for information; but since Elinor wished to spread as little as possible of that which, in the first place, had been obtained in such an underhanded manner, she limited herself to a succinct repetition of those simple details that she was sure Lucy, for her own interest, would want to be made public.</t3885> <t3886>The continuity of their engagement and the means they would use to bring it to a successful conclusion was all she recounted; and this led Mrs. Jennings to the following very natural observation:</t3886>
<t3887>—Wait until he gets a benefit!</t3887> <t3888>Of course, we all know how that will end: they will wait a year, and seeing that they get nothing that way, they will settle in a parish with fifty pounds a year, plus the interest from his two thousand pounds and the little that Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.</t3888> <t3889>And then they will have a child every year!</t3889> <t3890>And God forbid, how poor they will be!</t3890> <t3891>I have to see what I can give them to help them set up their house.</t3891> <t3892>Two maids and two servants I was saying the other day... no way!</t3892> <t3893>No, no, they must get a strong girl for all service.</t3893> <t3894>Betty's sister would be of no use to them now.</t3894>
<t3895>The next morning, Elinor received a letter by mail from Lucy herself.</t3895> <t3896>It read as follows:</t3896>
<t3897>Bartlett's Building, March</t3897>
<t3898>I hope that my dear Miss Dashwood will forgive the liberty I have taken in writing to her; but I know that her feelings of friendship towards me will make her pleased to hear such good news about me and my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have had to face recently; therefore, I will not excuse myself further and will proceed to tell her that, thank God!, although we have suffered terribly, we are now very well and as happy as we should always be, due to our mutual love.</t3898> <t3899>We have faced great trials and great persecutions, but, at the same time, we must thank many friends, among whom you occupy one of the most important places, whose great kindness I will always remember with all my gratitude, as will Edward, to whom I have spoken about you.</t3899> <t3900>I am sure that both you and dear Mrs. Jennings will be pleased to know that yesterday afternoon I spent two happy hours with him, that he did not want to hear about us separating, although I, thinking it was my duty, insisted on it in the name of prudence, and I would have separated from him at that very moment, had he accepted it; but he told me that it would never happen, he did not care about his mother's anger as long as he had my affection; our prospects are not very bright, to be honest, but we must hope and trust that the best will happen; he will be ordained very soon, and if it were within your power to recommend him to anyone who has a benefice to grant, I am sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too, we trust that she will intercede for us with Sir John or Mr. Palmer, or any friend who can help us.</t3900> <t3901>Poor Anne has been very much to blame for all this because of what she did, but she did it with the best intentions, so I say nothing; I hope it will not be a great problem for Mrs. Jennings to visit us, if one morning she comes this way; it would be very kind if she did, and my cousins would be proud to meet her.</t3901> <t3902>The paper on which I write reminds me that I must now finish, begging you to present my most grateful and respectful regards, as well as to Sir John and Lady Middleton, and to the dear children, when you have the opportunity to see them, and my love to Miss Marianne, I remain, etc., etc.</t3902>
<t3903>As soon as Elinor finished reading the letter, she carried out what, according to her conclusions, was the true objective of the person who had written it, and placed it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it aloud with profuse comments of satisfaction and praise.</t3903>
<t3904>—But how wonderful! And how beautifully she writes!</t3904> <t3905>Yes, well, it was very proper to release him from the commitment if he so wished.</t3905> <t3906>That was very characteristic of Lucy.</t3906> <t3907>Poor creature!</t3907> <t3908>With all my heart, I would like to be able to get her a benefit...</t3908> <t3909>Look, she calls me dear Mrs. Jennings.</t3909> <t3910>She is one of the best girls that exist... Very well, I tell you.</t3910> <t3911>That phrase is very well constructed.</t3911> <t3912>Yes, yes, of course I will go see her.</t3912> <t3913>How attentive, she thinks of everyone!</t3913> <t3914>Thank you, dear, for showing it to me.</t3914> <t3915>It is one of the most beautiful letters I have ever seen, and it speaks very well of Lucy's intelligence and feelings.</t3915>
<t3916>CHAPTER XXXIX</t3916>
<t3917>The Miss Dashwoods had already been in the city for a little over two months, and Marianne's impatience to leave increased day by day.</t3917> <t3918>She longed for the air, the freedom, the tranquility of the countryside; and she imagined that if any place could bring her peace, that place was Barton.</t3918> <t3919>Elinor's anxiety was no less, whose desire to leave immediately was only less than Marianne's to the extent that she was aware of the difficulties of such a long journey, something the latter refused to admit.</t3919> <t3920>Nevertheless, she began to seriously consider carrying it out, and had already mentioned her wishes to her kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good will, when a possibility arose that, although it still kept them away from home for a few more weeks, seemed to Elinor on the whole much more convenient than any other plan.</t3920> <t3921>The Palmers would go to Cleveland around the end of March, for Easter; and Mrs. Jennings, along with her two friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to accompany them.</t3921> <t3922>In itself, this offer would not have been sufficient for Miss Dashwood's delicacy; but as it was backed by a very real courtesy from Mr. Palmer, and added to this was the enormous improvement in his behavior towards them since it was known that his sister was going through very unhappy times, she could accept it with great pleasure.</t3922>
<t3923>When he told Marianne what he had done, however, her initial reaction was not very promising.</t3923>
<t3924>—Cleveland! —she exclaimed very agitatedly—.</t3924> <t3925>No, I can't go to Cleveland.</t3925>
<t3926>—You forget —Elinor gently replied to him that the house at Cleveland is not... that it is not in the vicinity of...</t3926>
<t3927>—But it is in Somersetshire...</t3927> <t3928>I cannot go to Somersetshire... There, where I so much wished to go... No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there.</t3928>
<t3929>Elinor did not want to discuss the advisability of overcoming such feelings; she merely endeavored to counteract them by resorting to others; and thus, she painted that trip as a way to set the time frame in which they could return to their dear mother, whom she so desired to see, in the most convenient and comfortable manner, and perhaps without much delay.</t3929> <t3930>From Cleveland, which was a few miles from Bristol, the distance to Barton was no more than a day's journey, albeit a long day; and her mother's servant could easily go there to accompany them; and as they would not have to stay in Cleveland for more than a week, they could be back home in a little over three weeks from that moment.</t3930> <t3931>Since Marianne's affection for her mother was sincere, it should overcome, with very few difficulties, the imaginary troubles she had set in motion.</t3931>
<t3932>Mrs. Jennings was so far from feeling tired of her guests that she urged them with great vehemence to return with her to her house from Cleveland.</t3932> <t3933>Elinor thanked her for the attention, but it did not succeed in changing their plans; and with the immediate agreement of their mother, they took all necessary measures to return home in the best possible conditions; and Marianne found some relief in writing down the hours that still separated her from Barton.</t3933>
<t3934>—Ah, Colonel!</t3934> <t3935>I don't know what we will do, you and I, without the Miss Dashwoods —were the words Mrs. Jennings addressed to him the first time he visited her after Elinor and Marianne's departure had been decided—, because they are determined to return to their home from the Palmers'; and how lonely we will be when I come back here! Goodness!</t3935> <t3936>We will sit and stare at each other with our mouths open, more bored than a couple of cats.</t3936>
<t3937>Perhaps Mrs. Jennings hoped that this expressive sketch of his future tedium would prompt him to make that proposal which would allow him to escape such a fate; and if so, shortly thereafter she had reason to think she had achieved her goal; for as Elinor approached the window to more expediently take the measurements of an engraving she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her with a particularly significant look and conversed with her for several minutes.</t3937> <t3938>Nor did the effect this conversation had on the young woman escape Mrs. Jennings' observation, for although she was too dignified to eavesdrop, and even moved to a place near the piano where Marianne was playing to avoid listening, she could not help but see that Elinor changed color, listened with great agitation, and was too engrossed in what he was saying to continue with her task.</t3938> <t3939>Confirming her hopes even more, in the interval when Marianne was switching from one lesson to another, she could not help but overhear some of the Colonel's words, with which he seemed to be apologizing for the poor state of his house.</t3939> <t3940>This eliminated all doubt in her.</t3940> <t3941>It did surprise her, it is true, that he thought it necessary, but she supposed it was the proper etiquette.</t3941> <t3942>She could not distinguish Elinor's response, but judging by the movement of her lips, it seemed she thought that was not a significant objection; and Mrs. Jennings praised her in her heart for her honesty.</t3942> <t3943>They continued talking without her being able to catch another word, when another fortunate pause in Marianne's playing brought these words to her ears in the Colonel's calm voice:</t3943>
<t3944>—I fear that it cannot be done very soon.</t3944>
<t3945>Astonished and frightened by such uncharacteristic words from a lover, she was almost on the verge of exclaiming out loud, "God! And what obstacles could there be!"; but restraining her impulse, she limited herself to exclaiming inwardly: "How strange! Surely he doesn't need to wait to be older."</t3945>
<t3946>This delay on the part of the colonel, however, did not seem to offend or mortify his beautiful companion in the least, for when shortly after they finished their conversation and went their separate ways, Mrs. Jennings clearly heard Elinor saying, in a voice that showed she meant what she said:</t3946>
<t3947>—I will always feel indebted to you.</t3947>
<t3948>Mrs. Jennings felt delighted by this display of gratitude, and was only surprised that the colonel, after hearing such words, could take his leave, as he did immediately, with the utmost composure, and leave without responding at all!</t3948> <t3949>She would never have thought that her old friend would be such an unenthusiastic suitor.</t3949>
<t3950>What they actually talked about among themselves was as follows:</t3950>
<t3951>—I have heard —he said, with enormous pity— of the injustice committed against your friend, Mr. Ferrars, by his family; if I am correct, they have completely ostracized him for persisting in his commitment to a very worthy young woman.</t3951> <t3952>Have I been informed correctly? Is that so?</t3952>
<t3953>Elinor replied that it was so.</t3953>
<t3954>—The cruelty, the gross cruelty —he replied, with great emotion— of dividing, or attempting to divide two young people who love each other, is terrible.</t3954> <t3955>Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she might be doing, where she might be leading her son.</t3955> <t3956>Two or three times I have seen Mr. Ferrars on Harley Street, and I like him very much.</t3956> <t3957>He is not a young man whom one can get to know intimately in a short time, but I have seen him enough to wish him well for his own merits, and as his friend, I wish him even more well.</t3957> <t3958>I understand that he wishes to be ordained.</t3958> <t3959>Would you be so kind as to tell him that the benefice of Delaford, which has just become vacant, as I was informed in today's mail, is his if he thinks it worth accepting?</t3959> <t3960>Although, perhaps, in the unfortunate circumstances in which he now finds himself, it would seem foolish to doubt it.</t3960> <t3961>I only wish that the benefice were of greater value.</t3961> <t3962>It is a rectory, but a small one; I believe the last incumbent did not make more than two hundred pounds a year, and although it can of course improve, I fear not in the amount that would allow Mr. Ferrars a very comfortable income.</t3962> <t3963>Nevertheless, in the current circumstances, I will be very pleased to present it to him.</t3963> <t3964>Please, tell him.</t3964>
<t3965>Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater if the colonel had actually been offering her marriage.</t3965> <t3966>Just two days ago she had thought that Edward had no hope of obtaining the position that would allow him to marry, and now it was his; and she, none other than she, was the one tasked with informing him!</t3966> <t3967>Her emotion was great, though Mrs. Jennings would have attributed it to another cause; and even if it was mixed with lesser, less pleasant feelings, she also felt immense gratitude and appreciation, which she expressed in warm words, for the general benevolence and special feelings of friendship that had led the colonel to make this gesture.</t3967> <t3968>She thanked him wholeheartedly, praised Edward's principles and disposition before him in the way she believed they deserved, and promised to carry out the commission with great pleasure, if it was indeed his wish to give such a pleasant task to another person.</t3968> <t3969>But, at the same time, she could not help but think that no one would fulfill it better than he.</t3969> <t3970>In short, it was a mission she would have liked to be free from, so as not to inflict upon Edward the pain of receiving a favor from her; but Colonel Brandon, guided by the same delicacy in preferring not to do it himself, seemed so determined that she should take charge, that Elinor did not want to refuse.</t3970> <t3971>She thought that Edward was still in town, and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele.</t3971> <t3972>She could, then, fulfill the task of informing him that very day.</t3972> <t3973>After this was agreed upon, Colonel Brandon began to speak of the advantages for him of having such a respectable and pleasant neighbor; and it was then that he regretted that the house was small and of average quality, a problem to which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings supposed she had done, did not give much importance, at least concerning the size of the dwelling.</t3973>
<t3974>—In my view —he told her—, it will not be an inconvenience for them that the house is small, because it will be proportional to their family and their income.</t3974>
<t3975>The colonel was surprised to discover that she thought of Edward's marriage as the direct consequence of the proposal, as she could not imagine that the benefit from Delaford could provide the type of income with which someone accustomed to the young man's lifestyle would dare to settle, and she said so.</t3975>
<t3976>—This small rectory only provides enough to support Mr. Ferrars as a bachelor; it does not allow him to marry.</t3976> <t3977>I regret to say that my patronage ends here, and my involvement goes no further.</t3977> <t3978>However, if by some unforeseen chance it were within my power to render him a new service, my opinion of him would have to have changed greatly if at that moment I were not as willing to be of assistance as I sincerely wish I could be now.</t3978> <t3979>What I do today seems scant, given that it allows him to advance so little towards what must be his principal, his sole reason for happiness.</t3979> <t3980>His marriage must still remain a distant good; at least, I fear it cannot take place very soon.</t3980>
<t3981>Such was the phrase that, by misunderstanding its meaning, so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this account of what truly happened between Colonel Brandon and Elinor while they were by the window, the gratitude expressed by her upon parting may perhaps appear, in general, no less reasonably kindled nor less appropriately articulated than if its cause had been a marriage proposal.</t3981>
<t3982>CHAPTER XL</t3982>
<t3983>—Well, Miss Dashwood —said Mrs. Jennings with a shrewd smile as soon as the gentleman had left—, I will not ask you what Colonel has been saying to you, for although, upon my honor, I tried not to listen, I could not help but hear enough to understand what he intended.</t3983> <t3984>I assure you that never in my life have I been more pleased, and I wholeheartedly wish that it brings you joy.</t3984>
<t3985>—Thank you, ma'am —said Elinor—.</t3985> <t3986>It is a source of great joy for me, and I feel that there is great sensitivity in Colonel Brandon's kindness.</t3986> <t3987>Not many men would act as he has.</t3987> <t3988>Few have such a compassionate heart!</t3988> <t3989>In my entire life, I had never been so astonished.</t3989>
<t3990>—Good God, dear, how modest you are!</t3990> <t3991>It doesn't surprise me at all, because lately I have often thought that it was very likely to happen.</t3991>
<t3992>—You were judging based on the general benevolence of the colonel; but at least you couldn't have foreseen that the opportunity would present itself so soon.</t3992>
<t3993>—The opportunity! —repeated Mrs. Jennings—.</t3993> <t3994>Ah!</t3994> <t3995>As for that, once a man has made up his mind about these things, he will find a way to create an opportunity one way or another.</t3995> <t3996>Well, dear, I congratulate you once again; and if there has ever been a happy couple in the world, I believe I will soon know where to find them.</t3996>
<t3997>—He plans to go to Delaford after them, I suppose —said Elinor with a faint smile.</t3997>
<t3998>—Of course, dear, I will certainly do it.</t3998> <t3999>And as for the house not being good, I don't know what the colonel was referring to, because it's one of the best I've seen.</t3999>
<t4000>—He said that he needed some repairs.</t4000>
<t4001>—Well, and whose fault is it?</t4001> <t4002>Why doesn't he fix it?</t4002> <t4003>Who else but him should do it?</t4003>
<t4004>Their conversation was interrupted by the servant's entrance, announcing that the carriage was already at the door; and Mrs. Jennings, immediately preparing to leave, said:</t4004>
<t4005>—Well, dear, I have to go before I've said even half of what I wanted to.</t4005> <t4006>But we can discuss it in detail tonight, because we will be alone.</t4006> <t4007>I'm not asking you to come with me, because I imagine your mind is too full to want company; and, besides, you must be eager to go and tell your sister everything.</t4007>
<t4008>Marianne had left the room before they started to talk.</t4008>
<t4009>—Of course, ma'am, I will tell Marianne; but for now, I will not mention it to anyone else.</t4009>
<t4010>—Ah, that's fine! —said Mrs. Jennings, somewhat disappointed—.</t4010> <t4011>Then you wouldn't want me to tell Lucy, because I plan to go to Holborn today.</t4011>
<t4012>—No, ma'am, not even to Lucy, if you please.</t4012> <t4013>A delay of one day will not mean much; and until I write to Mr. Ferrars, I think it should not be mentioned to anyone else.</t4013> <t4014>I will do it immediately.</t4014> <t4015>It is important not to waste time concerning him, because, of course, he will have much to do with his ordination.</t4015>
<t4016>This speech at the beginning left Mrs. Jennings extremely perplexed.</t4016> <t4017>At first, she did not understand why it was necessary to write to Edward about the matter with such urgency.</t4017> <t4018>A few moments of reflection, however, resulted in a very happy idea, which made her exclaim:</t4018>
<t4019>—Aha!</t4019> <t4020>Now I understand.</t4020> <t4021>Mr. Ferrars is going to be the man.</t4021> <t4022>Well, good for him.</t4022> <t4023>Of course, he has to hurry to take the orders; and I am very glad that things are so advanced between you.</t4023> <t4024>But, dear, isn't it somewhat unusual?</t4024> <t4025>Shouldn't it be the colonel who writes to him?</t4025> <t4026>Surely he is the right person.</t4026>
<t4027>Elinor did not understand the meaning of Mrs. Jennings' first words, and it did not seem worth asking; so, she only responded to the final part.</t4027>
<t4028>—Colonel Brandon is such a delicate man that he would prefer anyone else to convey his intentions to Mr. Fernars.</t4028>
<t4029>—And then you have to do it.</t4029> <t4030>Well, that certainly is a curious delicacy!</t4030> <t4031>But —he added upon seeing that she was getting ready to write— I won't bother you any longer.</t4031> <t4032>You know your own affairs better.</t4032> <t4033>So goodbye, dear.</t4033> <t4034>It's the best news I've had since Charlotte gave birth.</t4034>
<t4035>And he left, only to return in an instant.</t4035>
<t4036>—I just remembered Betty's sister, dear.</t4036> <t4037>She would be happy to get such a good nanny.</t4037> <t4038>But I really don't know if she will be suitable as a lady's maid.</t4038> <t4039>She is an excellent housemaid and handles the needle very well.</t4039> <t4040>But you will decide all that in due time.</t4040>
<t4041>—Of course, ma'am —replied Elinor, not really listening to what was being said, and more eager to be alone than to master the subject.</t4041>
<t4042>How to begin, how to express herself in her note to Edward, was all that concerned her now.</t4042> <t4043>The peculiar circumstances existing between them made it difficult, something that would have been the easiest thing in the world for anyone else; but she equally feared saying too much or too little, and she remained staring at the paper, pen in hand, until she was interrupted by Edward himself entering.</t4043>
<t4044>He had gone to leave his farewell card and had met Mrs. Jennings at the door as she was heading to the carriage; and she, after excusing herself for not returning with him, had insisted he come in, saying that Miss Dashwood was upstairs and wanted to speak with him about a very special matter.</t4044>
<t4045>Elinor had just been congratulating herself amidst her hesitations, thinking that no matter how difficult it might be to express herself adequately in writing, it was at least preferable to giving information verbally, when the sudden entrance of her visitor surprised and greatly confused her, forcing her to make a new effort, perhaps the greatest of all.</t4045> <t4046>She had not seen him since his engagement had become public and, therefore, since he had learned that she already knew about it; and this, combined with her awareness of what she had been thinking, and what she had to say to him, made her feel especially uncomfortable for a few minutes.</t4046> <t4047>Edward was also disturbed, and they sat facing each other in a situation that promised to be uncomfortable.</t4047> <t4048>He could not remember if he had excused himself for his intrusion upon entering the room; but, to be sure, he did so formally as soon as he could speak, after taking a seat.</t4048>
<t4049>—Mrs. Jennings informed me —he said— that you wished to speak with me; at least, that was what I understood... or I would not have imposed my presence on you in this manner; although, at the same time, I would have greatly regretted leaving London without having seen you and your sister; especially considering that it will surely be a long time... it is unlikely that I will have the pleasure of seeing you again.</t4049> <t4050>I leave for Oxford tomorrow.</t4050>
<t4051>—He would not have left, however —said Elinor, recovering and determined to finish as soon as possible with what she so feared—, without having received our best wishes, even if we could not offer them personally.</t4051> <t4052>Mrs. Jennings was very right in what she said.</t4052> <t4053>I have something important to communicate to you, which I was about to inform you of in writing.</t4053> <t4054>I have been entrusted with the most pleasant task —she was breathing somewhat faster than usual as she spoke—.</t4054> <t4055>Colonel Brandon, who was here just ten minutes ago, has asked me to tell you that, knowing you intend to be ordained, he has the great pleasure of offering you the benefice of Delaford, which has just become vacant, and he only wishes it were of greater value.</t4055> <t4056>Allow me to congratulate you on having such a worthy and prudent friend, and to join in his wish that the benefice, which amounts to around two hundred pounds a year, represented a more considerable sum, one that would allow you... given that it may be more than a temporary position for you... in short, one that would allow you to fulfill all your desires for happiness.</t4056>
<t4057>Since Edward was not able to say for himself what he felt, it can hardly be expected that another will say it for him.</t4057> <t4058>In appearance, he showed all the astonishment that such unexpected, such unsuspected information could not fail to produce; but he only said these three words:</t4058>
<t4059>—Colonel Brandon!</t4059>
<t4060>—Yes —continued Elinor, feeling more determined now that, at least in part, the worst had already passed—; Colonel Brandon wishes to express his concern for the recent events, for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you... a concern that I assure you is shared by Marianne, myself, and all your friends; and he also offers it as proof of the high regard in which he holds you, and especially as a sign of his approval of the behavior you have shown on this occasion.</t4060>
<t4061>—Colonel Brandon offers me a benefice! Is it even possible?</t4061>
<t4062>—The lack of generosity from his relatives leads him to be astonished to find friendship elsewhere.</t4062>
<t4063>—No —he replied, forming a sudden idea about what must have happened—, not of finding it in you, because I cannot ignore that to you, to your kindness, I owe all of this.</t4063> <t4064>What I feel... if I could, I would express it; but, as you well know, I am not an orator.</t4064>
<t4065>—You are very mistaken.</t4065> <t4066>I assure you that you owe it entirely, or at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and to Colonel Brandon's perception of it.</t4066> <t4067>I have had no involvement in this.</t4067> <t4068>I didn't even know, until he communicated his plans to me, that the benefit was vacant; nor had it occurred to me that he could grant such a benefit.</t4068> <t4069>As a friend of mine and my family, perhaps... in fact, I am sure that his pleasure in granting it is greater; but, I give you my word, you owe nothing to any mediation of mine.</t4069>
<t4070>In all honesty, she had to acknowledge a participation, even if it was small, in the action; but at the same time, she so little desired to appear as Edward's benefactor that she admitted it with hesitations, which probably contributed to fixing in his mind that idea which had just appeared to him as a suspicion.</t4070> <t4071>For a few moments after Elinor finished speaking, he remained lost in his thoughts; finally, as if making an effort, he said:</t4071>
<t4072>—Colonel Brandon seems to be a man of great worth and respectability.</t4072> <t4073>I have always heard him spoken of in those terms, and I know that Mr. Dashwood, his brother, holds him in high regard.</t4073> <t4074>Without a doubt, he is a man of great sense and a perfect gentleman in his manners.</t4074>
<t4075>—It is true —replied Elinor—, and I am sure that, upon getting to know him better, you will find that he is everything you have heard about him; and since you will be such close neighbors (because I understand that the rectory is almost adjacent to the main house), it is especially important that he is indeed so.</t4075>
<t4076>Edward did not respond; but when she turned her head away, he looked at her so seriously, so intensely, so joylessly, that with his eyes he seemed to say that, from that moment on, he would have wished the distance between the rectory and the mansion to be much greater.</t4076>
<t4077>Colonel Brandon, I believe, is staying on St. James Street? —he said shortly after, rising from his seat.</t4077>
<t4078>Elinor gave the house number.</t4078>
<t4079>—I must hurry, then, to express the gratitude that I have not been able to offer you; to assure you that you have made me very... enormously happy.</t4079>
<t4080>Elinor did not try to hold him back; and they parted after she had formally assured him of her strongest wishes for happiness in all the changes of circumstances he might experience; and he made some efforts to reciprocate the same good wishes, though without quite knowing how to express them.</t4080>
<t4081>"When I see him again," Elinor said to herself as the door closed behind him, "what I will see is Lucy's husband."</t4081>
<t4082>And with this pleasant prediction, she sat down to reconsider the past, recall the words, and try to understand Edward's feelings; and, of course, to reflect on her own discontent.</t4082>
<t4083>When Mrs. Jennings returned home, although she had been visiting people she had never seen before and therefore must have had much to say about them, her mind was so much more occupied with the important secret she possessed than with anything else that she resumed the topic as soon as Elinor appeared.</t4083>
<t4084>—Well, dear —he exclaimed—, I sent the young man.</t4084> <t4085>It went well, didn't it?</t4085> <t4086>And I suppose he didn't encounter any major difficulties.</t4086> <t4087>Didn't you find him too reluctant to accept your proposal?</t4087>
<t4088>—No, ma'am; such a thing was not to be expected.</t4088>
<t4089>—Well, and when will it be ready?</t4089> <t4090>It seems that everything depends on that.</t4090>
<t4091>—Actually —said Elinor—, I know so little about this kind of formalities that I can hardly make any guesses about the time or preparation required; but I suppose that in two or three months he will be able to complete his ordination.</t4091>
<t4092>—Two or three months? —exclaimed Mrs. Jennings—.</t4092> <t4093>My God, dear! And she says it so calmly!</t4093> <t4094>And the colonel having to wait two or three months!</t4094> <t4095>God forbid!</t4095> <t4096>I think I wouldn't have the patience.</t4096> <t4097>And although anyone would be very happy to do a favor for poor Mr. Ferrars, I really think it's not worth waiting two or three months.</t4097> <t4098>Surely someone else can be found who will serve just as well... someone who has already received the orders.</t4098>
<t4099>—My dear lady —said Elinor—, what are you talking about?</t4099> <t4100>But if the colonel Brandon's only objective is to do a service for Mr. Ferrars.</t4100>
<t4101>—May God bless you, my dear!</t4101> <t4102>I don't believe you are trying to convince me that the colonel is marrying you to give ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!</t4102>
<t4103>After this, the deception could not continue, and immediately gave way to an explanation that at the moment greatly amused both of them, without any significant loss of happiness for either, because Mrs. Jennings simply exchanged one joy for another, still without abandoning her expectations regarding the first.</t4103>
<t4104>—Yes, yes, the rectory is still small —he said, after the initial effervescence of his surprise and satisfaction—, and it probably needs repairs; but to hear a man apologizing, just as I thought, for a house that, as far as I know, has five living rooms on the first floor and, according to what I believe I heard from the housekeeper, can accommodate fifteen beds...!</t4104> <t4105>And for you too, accustomed to living in the little house in Barton!</t4105> <t4106>It seemed so ridiculous.</t4106> <t4107>But, dear, we must suggest to the colonel that he do something at the rectory, to prepare it for them before Lucy arrives.</t4107>
<t4108>—But Colonel Brandon does not seem to believe that the benefit is sufficient to allow them to marry.</t4108>
<t4109>—The colonel is a fool, dear; since he has two thousand pounds a year to live on, he thinks no one can marry with less.</t4109> <t4110>I give you my word that, if I am alive, I will visit the rectory of Delaford before Michaelmas; and believe me, I will not go if Lucy is not there.</t4110>
<t4111>Elinor was of the same opinion that they probably were not going to wait any longer.</t4111>
<t4112>CHAPTER XLI</t4112>
<t4113>After having gone to thank Colonel Brandon, Edward headed to Lucy's house with his happiness in tow; and it was so great when he arrived at Bartlett's Buildings, that the next day the young woman was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who had visited to congratulate her, that she had never before in her life seen him so happy.</t4113>
<t4114>At least Lucy's happiness and her mood left no room for doubt, and with great enthusiasm, she joined Mrs. Jennings in her expectations of a pleasant meeting at the Delaford rectory before Michaelmas.</t4114> <t4115>At the same time, she was far from denying Elinor the credit that Edward would give her, as she referred to her friendship for both with the most enthusiastic gratitude, was ready to acknowledge how much they owed her, and openly declared that no effort, present or future, that Miss Dashwood made for their benefit would surprise her, as she believed her capable of anything for those she truly cared about.</t4115> <t4116>As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only willing to adore him like a saint, but moreover, she truly wished that in all earthly matters he would be treated as such; she wished that the contributions he received would increase to the maximum; and she secretly decided that, once in Delaford, she would make the most use of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his chickens.</t4116>
<t4117>A week had already passed since John Dashwood's visit to Berkeley Street, and as they had not received any news about his wife's indisposition beyond a verbal inquiry, Elinor began to feel that it was necessary to pay her a visit.</t4117> <t4118>However, such an obligation not only went against her own inclinations, but she also found no encouragement from her companions.</t4118> <t4119>Marianne, not satisfied with absolutely refusing to go, tried with all her might to prevent her sister from going; and as for Mrs. Jennings, although her carriage was always at Elinor's disposal, she disliked Mrs. John Dashwood so much that neither the curiosity to see how she was after the late discovery, nor her intense desire to offend her by taking Edward's side, could overcome her reluctance to be in her company again.</t4119> <t4120>As a result, Elinor set out alone on a visit that no one could have less desire to make, and to run the risk of a tête-à-tête with a woman who could not be more disagreeable to anyone than to her.</t4120>
<t4121>They told her that Mrs. Dashwood was not at home; but before the carriage could turn back, her husband happened to come out.</t4121> <t4122>He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her that he was just on his way to visit them at Berkeley Street, and assuring her that Fanny would be happy to see her, invited her to come in.</t4122>
<t4123>They went up to the room.</t4123> <t4124>There was no one there.</t4124>
<t4125>—I suppose Fanny is in her room —he said to her—; I will go find her immediately, because I am sure she will have no objection to seeing you... far from it, actually.</t4125> <t4126>Especially now... but, anyway, you and Marianne were always her favorites.</t4126> <t4127>Why didn't Marianne come?</t4127>
<t4128>Elinor excused her as best as she could.</t4128>
<t4129>—I do not regret seeing you alone —he replied—, because I have much to talk to you about.</t4129> <t4130>This benefit from Colonel Brandon, is it true?</t4130> <t4131>Has he really offered it to Edward?</t4131> <t4132>I heard about it by chance yesterday, and I was coming to see you with the purpose of finding out more about it.</t4132>
<t4133>—It is completely true.</t4133> <t4134>Colonel Brandon has given the Delaford living to Edward.</t4134>
<t4135>—Is it possible? How incredible!</t4135> <t4136>There is no relationship, no kinship between them!</t4136> <t4137>And now that the benefits are being negotiated at such a high price!</t4137> <t4138>How much does this one give?</t4138>
<t4139>—About two hundred pounds a year.</t4139>
<t4140>—Very well, and for the next application for a benefit of that value, assuming the last holder was old and in poor health, and was going to leave it vacant soon, he could have obtained, say, fourteen hundred pounds.</t4140> <t4141>And how is it possible that he didn't arrange that matter before this person died?</t4141> <t4142>Of course, now it's too late to sell it, but someone with Colonel Brandon's judgment!</t4142> <t4143>I'm surprised that he was so shortsighted in something that is so usual, so natural to worry about!</t4143> <t4144>Well, I am convinced that almost all human beings have enormous inconsistencies.</t4144> <t4145>Thinking about it, however, I suppose this is what has happened: Edward will keep the benefit until the person to whom the colonel has actually sold the application is old enough to take charge of it.</t4145> <t4146>Yes, yes, that's what has happened, you can be sure.</t4146>
<t4147>Elinor contradicted him, however, firmly; and forced him to accept her authority on the matter by telling him that Colonel Brandon had entrusted her with conveying his offer to Edward and, therefore, she had to understand well the terms in which it had been made.</t4147>
<t4148>—It is truly amazing! —he exclaimed, after listening to her words—.</t4148> <t4149>And what reason would the colonel have had to do it?</t4149>
<t4150>—A very simple one: to help Mr. Ferrars.</t4150>
<t4151>—Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward Ferrars is a fortunate man!</t4151> <t4152>However, do not mention this matter to Fanny; because although she has heard it from me and has taken it quite well, she will not want to hear much about it.</t4152>
<t4153>At this point, Elinor found it somewhat difficult to refrain from observing that, in her opinion, Fanny could very well have borne with composure the acquisition of a capital by her brother through means that did not signify an impoverishment for either her or her son.</t4153>
<t4154>—Mrs. Ferrars —he added, lowering his voice to a tone befitting the importance of the matter— still knows nothing about this, and I think it will be best to keep it from her as long as possible.</t4154> <t4155>When the wedding takes place, I fear she will have to be told everything.</t4155>
<t4156>—But why would she take such precautions?</t4156> <t4157>Although it should not be assumed that Mrs. Ferrars could have the slightest satisfaction in knowing that her son has enough money to live on... such a thing would be unthinkable; but why, after what she did, should it be assumed that she cares at all?</t4157> <t4158>She has finished with her son, expelled him from her side forever, and made all those over whom she has influence do the same.</t4158> <t4159>Surely, after having done this, it is impossible to imagine her capable of feeling any sorrow or joy related to him... she cannot be interested in anything that happens to him.</t4159> <t4160>She won't be so inconsistent as to disregard the well-being of a son, and then continue to worry about him as a mother would!</t4160>
<t4161>—Oh, Elinor! —said John—.</t4161> <t4162>Your reasoning is good, but at its core, it lacks an understanding of human nature.</t4162> <t4163>When Edward's unfortunate union takes place, rest assured that his mother will suffer as much as if she had never cast him aside; therefore, as long as possible, it is necessary to hide all the circumstances that could hasten that terrible moment.</t4163> <t4164>Mrs. Ferrars will never be able to forget that Edward is her son.</t4164>
<t4165>—You surprise me; I would have thought that by now it had almost faded from memory.</t4165>
<t4166>—You are completely mistaken.</t4166> <t4167>Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers that exist.</t4167>
<t4168>Elinor remained silent.</t4168>
<t4169>– Now -said Mr. Dashwood after a brief pause—, we are thinking that Robert should marry Miss Morton.</t4169>
<t4170>Elinor, smiling at the grave and very important tone of her brother's voice, responded very calmly:</t4170>
<t4171>—The lady, I imagine, has no choice in this.</t4171>
<t4172>—Option! What do you mean?</t4172>
<t4173>—All I want to say is that I suppose, from the way you talk, that Miss Morton must not care whether she marries Edward or Robert.</t4173>
<t4174>—Of course, there is no difference at all; because now Robert, for all intents and purposes, will be considered the eldest son; and otherwise, both are very pleasant young men... I have not known one to be superior to the other.</t4174>
<t4175>Elinor said nothing more, and John also remained silent for a few moments.</t4175> <t4176>He ended his reflections in the following manner:</t4176>
<t4177>—About one thing, my dear sister —he said, taking her hand affectionately and speaking in an impressive whisper—, you can be sure: and I will let you know, because I know it will please you.</t4177> <t4178>I have good reasons to believe... indeed, I know it from the best source or I wouldn't repeat it, because otherwise, it would be very improper to mention it... but I know it from the best source... not that I heard it exactly from Mrs. Ferrars herself, but her daughter did, and she told me... that, in short, beyond the objections there might have been against a certain... certain union... you understand... Mrs. Ferrars would have preferred it a thousand times, it wouldn't have bothered her half as much as this one.</t4178> <t4179>I felt extremely happy to know that she saw it from that perspective... a very gratifying circumstance, you can imagine, for all of us.</t4179> <t4180>“There would have been no comparison,” she said, “of two evils, the lesser; and now she would be willing to compromise to prevent anything worse from happening.”</t4180> <t4181>But all that is out of the question: we must not think of it, nor mention it; regarding any union, you know... there is no possibility... all that is over.</t4181> <t4182>But I thought I'd tell you this, because I knew how much it would please you.</t4182> <t4183>Not that you have anything to regret, my dear Elinor.</t4183> <t4184>There is no doubt that you are doing very well... just as well or, all things considered, perhaps better...</t4184> <t4185>Have you been with Colonel Brandon lately?</t4185>
<t4186>Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity and elevate her self-esteem, to agitate her nerves and make her think; and she was therefore glad that Mr. Ferrars' entrance saved her from having to respond to so much and from the danger of listening further to her brother.</t4186> <t4187>After chatting for a few moments, John Dashwood, remembering that he had not yet informed Fanny of his sister's presence, left the room in search of her.</t4187> <t4188>And Elinor was left there with the task of improving her relationship with Robert, who, with his cheerful nonchalance, with the satisfied self-complacency that allowed him to enjoy such an unjust distribution of his mother's love and generosity to the detriment of his excluded brother... love and generosity that he had earned only through his own dissipated life and the integrity of that brother, confirmed Elinor in her most unfavorable opinion of his intelligence and feelings.</t4188>
<t4189>They had only been alone for two minutes when he started talking about Edward, as he had also heard about the benefice and asked many questions about it.</t4189> <t4190>Elinor repeated the details she had already communicated to John, and the effect they had on Robert, though very different, was no less strong.</t4190> <t4191>He laughed without any moderation.</t4191> <t4192>The idea of Edward transformed into a clergyman and living in a small parsonage amused him endlessly; and when he added the fantastic vision of Edward reading prayers dressed in a white surplice and making the public admonitions of the marriage of John Smith and Mary Brown, he could not imagine anything more ridiculous.</t4192>
<t4193>Elinor, meanwhile, waited in silence and with unshakable seriousness for the end of such nonsense, unable to prevent her eyes from fixing on him with a look that showed all the contempt he inspired in her.</t4193> <t4194>It was a look, however, very well directed, because it relieved her feelings without conveying anything to him.</t4194> <t4195>When he set aside his witty comments, it was not due to any reproach from her, but because of his own sensitivity.</t4195>
<t4196>—We can joke about it —he finally said, recovering from the affected laughter that had considerably prolonged the genuine joy of the moment—, but, upon my word, it is something very serious.</t4196> <t4197>Poor Edward!</t4197> <t4198>He is ruined forever.</t4198> <t4199>I regret it enormously, because I know he is a creature of very good heart, as well-intentioned as anyone.</t4199> <t4200>You must not judge him, Miss Dashwood, based on how little you know him.</t4200> <t4201>Poor Edward!</t4201> <t4202>It is true that his manners are not the most pleasant.</t4202> <t4203>But it is well known that not all of us are born with the same abilities, with the same bearing.</t4203> <t4204>Poor boy! Imagine him among strangers!</t4204> <t4205>What a lamentable thing!</t4205> <t4206>But upon my word, he has as great a heart as the best in the kingdom; and I tell you and assure you that nothing has ever shaken me as much as what has happened.</t4206> <t4207>I could not believe it.</t4207> <t4208>My mother was the first to tell me, and I, feeling that I had to act decisively, immediately said to her: “My dear lady, I do not know what you intend to do in these circumstances, but as for me, I must tell you that if Edward marries this young woman, I will never look at him again.”</t4208> <t4209>That is what I said to her immediately... I felt scandalized beyond all imagination! Poor Edward!</t4209> <t4210>He has completely sunk!</t4210> <t4211>He has forever marginalized himself from all decent society!</t4211> <t4212>But while I was saying it directly to my mother, I was not surprised at all; it is what could be expected from the education he received.</t4212> <t4213>My poor mother almost went mad.</t4213>
<t4214>—Have you ever seen the young woman?</t4214>
<t4215>—Yes, once, when she was staying in this house.</t4215> <t4216>I had dropped by for about ten minutes, and what I saw of her was enough.</t4216> <t4217>A simple country girl, awkward, without style or elegance, and almost without any charm.</t4217> <t4218>I remember her perfectly.</t4218> <t4219>Just the type of girl I would have thought capable of captivating poor Edward.</t4219> <t4220>As soon as my mother told me the whole matter, I immediately offered—to speak to him, to dissuade him from the union; but, as I could see, it was already too late to do anything, for unfortunately I was not there in the early moments and knew nothing of what had happened until after the breakup, when, you know, it was not my place to interfere.</t4220> <t4221>But if I had been informed a few hours earlier, I probably could have done something.</t4221> <t4222>In any case, I would have made Edward see things clearly.</t4222> <t4223>“My dear friend,” I would have said, “think about what you are doing.</t4223> <t4224>You are committing yourself to the most unfortunate union, which your entire family unanimously disapproves of.”</t4224> <t4225>Anyway, I can't help but think I would have found some way to achieve it.</t4225> <t4226>But now it's too late.</t4226> <t4227>He must be starving, you know; absolutely starving, for sure.</t4227>
<t4228>She had just raised this point with great composure when the arrival of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the topic.</t4228> <t4229>But although she never mentioned it outside her own family, Elinor could see how it influenced her mind, visible in that somewhat confused expression she had upon entering and in an attempt at cordiality in her dealings with her.</t4229> <t4230>She even went so far as to be affected by the fact that Elinor and her sister would be leaving the city so soon, and had hoped to see them more; an effort in which her husband, who had accompanied her to the room and followed her every word with a lovestruck air, seemed to find everything most affectionate and graceful.</t4230>
<t4231>CHAPTER XLII</t4231>
<t4232>Another short visit to Harley Street, during which Elinor received her brother's congratulations for traveling to Barton without incurring any expenses and for the fact that Colonel Brandon might follow them to Cleveland in a day or two, completed the contact between brother and sisters in the city; and a weak invitation from Fanny to go to Norland whenever they happened to pass by, which of all possible things was the least likely, along with a warmer, though less public, promise from John to Elinor regarding a prompt visit to Delaford, was all that was said regarding a future meeting in the countryside.</t4232>
<t4233>It amused Elinor to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford, of all places, precisely the one she would least want to visit or the last place she would wish to live; for not only did her brother and Mrs. Jennings consider it her future home, but even Lucy, upon saying goodbye, insisted on inviting her to visit there.</t4233>
<t4234>In the early days of April, and in the early hours of the morning, although tolerably early, the two groups, coming from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street, left their respective homes to meet on the road, as they had agreed.</t4234> <t4235>For the comfort of Charlotte and her son, they would take more than two days on the journey, and Mr. Palmer, moving more expediently with Colonel Brandon, would join them in Cleveland shortly after.</t4235>
<t4236>Marianne, although the pleasant hours spent in London had been few and as eager as she had been for so long to leave there, when the moment came, she could not avoid a great sorrow in saying goodbye to the house where for the last time she had enjoyed those hopes and that confidence in Willoughby that now had faded away forever.</t4236> <t4237>Nor could she leave the place where Willoughby was engaging in new commitments and new plans in which she would have no part, without shedding copious tears.</t4237>
<t4238>Elinor's satisfaction at the moment of departure was more genuine.</t4238> <t4239>There was nothing in London that entertained her thoughts and remained in her memories; she left no one behind whose permanent separation would cause her even a moment of sorrow; she was glad to be free from Lucy's friendship pursuit; she was grateful to take her sister away from there without having encountered Willoughby since his marriage, and she had hopes that a few months of tranquility in Barton could restore Marianne's peace of mind and strengthen her own.</t4239>
<t4240>The journey proceeded without incident.</t4240> <t4241>The second day took them to the beloved, or despised, county of Somerset, which alternated in Marianne's imagination; and on the morning of the third day, they arrived at Cleveland.</t4241>
<t4242>Cleveland was a spacious house, of modern construction, located on the slope of a grass-covered hill.</t4242> <t4243>It did not have a park, but the pleasure gardens were of a good size; and like any other place of the same importance, it had its underwood and its avenue; a smooth gravel path that circled a plantation led to the front of the house; the lawn was dotted with trees; the house itself stood sheltered by firs, rowans, and acacias, and all together, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, formed a thick barrier that concealed the view of the outbuildings.</t4243>
<t4244>Marianne entered the house with her heart swelling with emotion at knowing she was only eighty miles from Barton and no more than thirty from Combe Magna; and before she had been within its walls for fifteen minutes, while the others were helping Charlotte, who wanted to show the child to the housekeeper, she slipped out again, sneaking through the winding paths among the shrubs that were just beginning to turn green, to reach a distant mound; and there, from a Greek temple, her gaze, sweeping over a wide area of countryside to the southeast, could tenderly rest on the distant hills silhouetted against the horizon and imagine that from their peaks Combe Magna could be seen.</t4244>
<t4245>In such moments of precious, incomparable anguish, she became intoxicated with tears of agony for being in Cleveland; and upon returning by different paths to the house, feeling the happy privilege of enjoying the freedom of the countryside, of wandering from place to place in a sovereign and luxurious solitude, she resolved to devote most of the hours of every day she would stay with the Palmers to the pleasure of these solitary wanderings.</t4245>
<t4246>He returned just in time to join the others as they were leaving the house for an excursion around the vicinity; and the rest of the morning passed quickly as they strolled leisurely through the orchard, examining the flowering vines on the walls and listening to the gardener lamenting about the pests; they leisurely toured the greenhouse, where the loss of their favorite plants, recklessly exposed and burned by frost, made Charlotte laugh; and they visited the poultry yard, where she found new reasons for joy in the maid's broken hopes: hens abandoning their nests, being stolen by a fox, or broods of promising chicks dying prematurely.</t4246>
<t4247>As the morning had been beautiful and without humidity in the air, Marianne, with her plans to spend most of the time outside, did not think that the weather could change during her stay at Cleveland.</t4247> <t4248>It was a great surprise, then, to find that a tenacious rain prevented her from going out after dinner.</t4248> <t4249>She had counted on an evening walk to the Greek temple, and perhaps around the entire place, and an evening that was merely cold or damp would not have dissuaded her; but a dense and persistent rain could not even to her seem like dry and pleasant weather for a walk.</t4249>
<t4250>The household members formed a small group, and the hours passed peacefully.</t4250> <t4251>Mrs. Palmer had her son and Mrs. Jennings her embroidery; they talked about the friends they had left behind, organized Lady Middleton's engagements, and several times wondered if Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get past Reading that night.</t4251> <t4252>Elinor, although with little interest in the conversation, participated in it; and Marianne, who had the knack for finding the library in any house, no matter.</t4252> <t4253>how much the family generally avoided her, very soon got hold of a book.</t4253>
<t4254>Mrs. Palmer spared nothing that her constant good humor and friendly spirit could offer to make her guests feel welcome.</t4254> <t4255>The frankness and warmth of her manner more than compensated for that lack of composure and elegance that often made her fail in the formalities of courtesy; she won people over with her affability, accredited by her very pretty face; her foolishness, though evident, was not unpleasant because she was not pretentious; and Elinor could have forgiven her anything, except her laugh.</t4255>
<t4256>The arrival of the two gentlemen the next day, at a very late dinner, brought a pleasant increase in attendance and a very welcome variation in the conversations, which a long morning under the same steady rain had reduced to very low levels.</t4256>
<t4257>Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen such diversity in his treatment of her sister and herself, that she did not know what to expect from him when encountering him in his own family.</t4257> <t4258>What she found, however, was perfectly gentlemanly behavior towards all his guests, and only occasionally harsh towards his wife and her mother; she found him very capable of being pleasant company, and the only thing that prevented him from always being so was an excessive capacity to feel as superior to people in general as he must have believed himself to be with respect to Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte.</t4258> <t4259>As for the remaining aspects of his character and habits, they did not show, as far as Elinor could perceive, any unusual traits in people of his sex and age.</t4259> <t4260>He liked a good table, but he usually did not arrive on time; he loved his son, but pretended disdain; and he idled at the billiard table during the mornings instead of dedicating them to business.</t4260> <t4261>Overall, however, Elinor liked him much more than she had expected, and in her heart did not regret that she could not like him more: she did not regret that the observation of his epicureanism, his selfishness, and his presumption led her to rest gladly in the memory of Edward's generous temperament, his simple tastes, and timid feelings.</t4261>
<t4262>In those days, Elinor received news of Edward, or at least of some events related to his interests, through Colonel Brandon, who had recently been in Dorsetshire and who, addressing her at the same time as an unselfish friend of Mr. Ferrars and her gentle confidant, spoke to her at length about the rectory of Delaford, describing its deficiencies and—telling her what he planned to do to solve them.</t4262> <t4263>His behavior towards her in this, as in everything else; his sincere pleasure in seeing her after an absence of only ten days; his willingness to converse with her and his respect for her opinions, could well justify Mrs. Jennings's conviction that he was in love with her, and perhaps would have been enough for Elinor to suspect it too if she did not believe, as she had from the beginning, that Marianne remained his true preference.</t4263> <t4264>But as things were, that idea would not have crossed her mind if it were not for Mrs. Jennings's insinuations; and between the two, Elinor could not help but consider herself the better observer: she watched the Colonel's eyes, while Mrs. Jennings only thought about his behavior; and while his looks of anxious concern when Marianne began to show the first symptoms of a severe cold manifested in headaches and sore throat, not being expressed in words, completely escaped Mrs. Jennings's observation, she could discover in his eyes the vivid feelings and unnecessary alarm of a lover.</t4264>
<t4265>Two delightful evening walks on the third and fourth day of her stay there, not only over the dry gravel among the bushes but throughout the entire place, and especially in the more distant corners, where there was a bit more wildlife than in the rest, where the trees were older and the grass longer and wetter, had produced in Marianne —with the help of the enormous imprudence of keeping on her wet stockings and shoes— such a violent cold that, although for a day or two she tried to downplay or deny it, it eventually imposed itself through increasingly severe discomforts, until it could no longer be ignored either by herself or by the concern of others.</t4265> <t4266>From all sides, remedies poured in, which, as always, were rejected.</t4266> <t4267>Although she felt weak and feverish, with aching limbs, a cough, and a sore throat, a good night's sleep would completely cure her; and it was with considerable difficulty that Elinor managed to persuade her, when she went to bed, to try one or two of the simpler remedies.</t4267>
<t4268>CHAPTER XLIII</t4268>
<t4269>The next day, Marianne got up at her usual time; to all questions, she responded that she felt better and tried to convince herself of it by dedicating herself to her usual activities.</t4269> <t4270>But having spent an entire day sitting by the fireplace shivering with chills, with a book in her hand that she was unable to read, or lying on a sofa, weak and without strength, did not speak very well of her improvement; and when she finally went to bed early feeling worse and worse, Colonel Brandon was simply astonished at Elinor's calmness, who, although she attended to and cared for her throughout the day, against Marianne's wishes and forcing her to take the necessary medicines at night, had the same confidence as her in the safety and efficacy of sleep, and was not truly alarmed.</t4270>
<t4271>A very restless and feverish night, however, dashed the hopes of both; and when Marianne, after insisting on getting up, confessed herself unable to sit and voluntarily returned to bed, Elinor was ready to accept Mrs. Jennings' advice and send for the Palmers' apothecary.</t4271>
<t4272>The apothecary arrived, examined the patient, and although he encouraged Miss Dashwood to trust that a few days would restore her sister's health, by declaring that her ailment had a putrid tendency and allowing his lips to pronounce the word "infection," he instantly alarmed Mrs. Palmer, for her son.</t4272> <t4273>Mrs. Jennings, who from the beginning had believed the illness to be more serious than Elinor thought, listened gravely to Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte's fears and concerns, urged her to leave with her child; and Mr. Palmer, although he tried to dismiss her apprehensions as vain,</t4273> <t4274>found himself unable to resist his wife's enormous anxiety and persistence.</t4274> <t4275>It was then decided that they would leave; and less than an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she departed with her little boy and the nurse to the house of a close relative of Mr. Palmer, who lived a few miles past Bath; there, at her insistent pleas, her husband promised to join her in one or two days, and to that place her mother promised to accompany her, also obeying her entreaties.</t4275> <t4276>Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness that made Elinor truly appreciate her, was determined not to leave Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and to strive through her most attentive care to replace the mother from whom she had been separated; and at all times Elinor found in her an active and willing collaborator, eager to share all her efforts and, very often, of great help due to her greater experience in caring for the sick.</t4276>
<t4277>Poor Marianne, lifeless and dejected by the nature of her illness and feeling completely unwell, could no longer hope that she would recover the next day; and thinking about what would have happened the next day if not for her unfortunate illness, worsened her discomfort; because that day they were going to start their journey home and, accompanied all the way by one of Mrs. Jennings' servants, they would surprise their mother the next morning.</t4277> <t4278>The little she spoke was to lament this inevitable delay; and this despite Elinor's attempts to lift her spirits and make her believe, as she herself believed at that moment, that this delay would be very brief.</t4278>
<t4279>The next day brought little or no change in the patient's condition; she was evidently not better, and apart from the fact that there was no improvement, she did not seem to have worsened.</t4279> <t4280>The group had now reduced even further, for Mr. Palmer, though not very eager to leave, both out of humanitarian spirit and his good nature, as well as not wanting to appear intimidated by his wife, eventually let Colonel Brandon persuade him to follow her, as he had promised; and while he was preparing his departure, Colonel Brandon himself, making a much greater effort, also began to talk about leaving.</t4280> <t4281>At this point, however, Mrs. Jennings' kindness intervened in a very good way, for the colonel to leave while his beloved was suffering such distress on account of her sister would mean depriving them both of all comfort; and so, telling him without delay that his presence at Cleveland was necessary for her, that she needed him to play piquet with her in the afternoons while Miss Dashwood was upstairs with her sister, etc., she insisted so much that he stay, that he, in complying with what his heart desired in the first place, could not even pretend for long any hesitation about it, especially when Mrs. Jennings' pleas were warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed relieved to leave there someone so capable of supporting or advising Miss Dashwood in any emergency.</t4281>
<t4282>Marianne, of course, was kept unaware of all these arrangements.</t4282> <t4283>She did not know that she had been the cause of the owners of Cleveland having to leave their house within a week of arriving.</t4283> <t4284>She was not surprised not to see Mrs. Palmer, and since it did not concern her, she never mentioned her name.</t4284>
<t4285>Two days had passed since Mr. Palmer's departure, and the patient's condition remained the same, with very few changes.</t4285> <t4286>Mr. Harris, who visited her every day, quite boldly continued to speak of a rapid recovery, and Miss Dashwood was equally optimistic; but the others did not have such cheerful expectations.</t4286> <t4287>Very early in the attack, Mrs. Jennings had decided that Marianne would never recover; and Colonel Brandon, whose main service was to listen to Mrs. Jennings' predictions, was not in a state of mind capable of resisting her influence.</t4287> <t4288>He tried to resort to reason to overcome fears that the differing opinion of the apothecary made seem absurd; but the many hours he spent alone each day were too conducive to nurturing sad thoughts, and he could not erase from his mind the conviction that he would not see Marianne alive again.</t4288>
<t4289>On the morning of the third day, however, the gloomy predictions of both turned out to be almost wrong, for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient much better.</t4289> <t4290>Her pulse was stronger and she showed much more favorable symptoms than on his previous visit.</t4290> <t4291>Elinor, with her most hopeful expectations confirmed, was all joy.</t4291> <t4292>She was happy because, in her letters to her mother, she had relied on her own judgment rather than that of her friends, and had downplayed the indisposition that had delayed their departure from Cleveland, and she almost dared to set the date when Marianne could travel.</t4292>
<t4293>But the day did not end as auspiciously as it had begun.</t4293> <t4294>Towards dusk, Marianne's illness worsened, with more heaviness, agitation, and discomfort than before.</t4294> <t4295>Her sister, however, still optimistic, preferred to attribute the change only to the fatigue of having been sitting while her bed was being made; and after carefully administering the prescribed cordials, she joyfully saw her fall into a slumber that she hoped would be very beneficial.</t4295> <t4296>Her sleep, although not as peaceful as Elinor had hoped, lasted a considerable time; and she, eager to observe the results for herself, decided to stay by her side until she woke up.</t4296> <t4297>Mrs. Jennings, who was not aware of the change in the patient, went to bed earlier than usual; her maid, one of the main caregivers of the sick girl, was seeking some solace in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.</t4297>
<t4298>Marianne's sleep began to grow increasingly restless; and Elinor, who at no moment ceased to attentively observe her continuous changes of position and listen to the repeated, though inarticulate moans that escaped her lips, almost wished to wake her from such a painful stupor when Marianne, suddenly awakened by an unexpected noise in the house, sat up startled, exclaiming in a feverish delirium:</t4298>
<t4299>—Has mom come?</t4299>
<t4300>—Not yet —replied her sister, hiding her terror and helping Marianne to lie down again—; although I hope he will be here later.</t4300> <t4301>It's a long way, you know, from here to Barton.</t4301>
<t4302>—But he must not go through London —exclaimed Marianne, with the same anxious tone—.</t4302> <t4303>I will never see her again, if she goes to London.</t4303>
<t4304>Alarmed, Elinor realized that Marianne was delirious, and while trying to calm her, she anxiously took her pulse.</t4304> <t4305>It was weaker and faster than ever; and seeing that Marianne continued to rave about their mother, her fear increased to the point of deciding to immediately send for Mr. Harris and dispatch a messenger to Barton to bring her mother.</t4305> <t4306>Along with making this resolution, she thought of consulting immediately with Colonel Barton on the best way to carry it out; and thus, as soon as she had called the maid to replace her by her sister's side, she hurried down to the room where she knew he was usually found, although much later than the current moment.</t4306>
<t4307>It was not a time for hesitations.</t4307> <t4308>Immediately, he made his fears and difficulties known.</t4308> <t4309>His fears, the colonel neither had the courage nor the confidence necessary to attempt to appease them: he listened to them with silent dismay; but he took charge of his difficulties immediately, for with a speed that seemed to indicate he had mentally anticipated the occasion and the required service, he offered to be the messenger who would bring Mrs. Dashwood.</t4309> <t4310>Elinor did not present any objections that could not be easily refuted.</t4310> <t4311>She thanked him with brief but fervent words, and while he hurried to send his servant with a message for Mr. Harris and an order to get post horses immediately, she wrote a few lines to her mother.</t4311>
<t4312>The comfort of a friend like Colonel Brandon in those moments, a companion of such kind for her mother... what immense gratitude it awakened in her!</t4312> <t4313>A friend whose judgment would guide her, whose company would alleviate her pain, and whose affection might calm her...!</t4313> <t4314>To the extent that the disturbance caused by such a call could be softened for her, his presence, his manner, and his help would surely achieve it.</t4314>
<t4315>He, meanwhile, whatever he might have felt, acted with all the firmness of an orderly mind; he made all the necessary arrangements with the utmost diligence, and calculated with precision the moment when she could expect his return.</t4315> <t4316>He did not lose a single instant in delays of any kind.</t4316> <t4317>The horses arrived even earlier than expected, and Colonel Brandon, limiting himself to shaking Elinor's hand with a solemn look and a few words spoken in a voice too low to reach her ears, hurried to mount the carriage.</t4317> <t4318>It was then approximately twelve o'clock, and Elinor returned to her sister's quarters to await the arrival of the apothecary and watch over her for the rest of the night.</t4318> <t4319>It was a night of almost equal suffering for both sisters.</t4319> <t4320>Hour after hour passed in sleepless pain and delirium for Marianne, and the most cruel anxiety for Elinor, before Mr. Harris appeared.</t4320> <t4321>Elinor's fears had been awakened, making her pay dearly for all her previous security, and the servant sitting beside her —for she had not allowed them to call Mrs. Jennings— tortured her even more by insinuating the things her mistress had thought from the beginning.</t4321>
<t4322>At intervals, Marianne's thoughts remained incoherently fixed on her mother, and each time she mentioned her name, poor Elinor's heart suffered a pang of pain; she reproached herself for having taken so many days of illness lightly, and longing for immediate relief, she thought that soon all relief would be in vain, that everything had been delayed too much, and she imagined her afflicted mother arriving too late to see her precious daughter alive or in possession of her senses.</t4322>
<t4323>He was about to send for Mr. Harris again or, if he could not come, seek new advice, when the apothecary —but not before five— made his appearance.</t4323> <t4324>His opinion, however, somewhat compensated for his tardiness, for although he acknowledged an unexpected and unfavorable change in his patient, he insisted that there was no serious danger and referred to the relief that a new treatment should provide with a confidence that, to a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor.</t4324> <t4325>He promised to return within the next three or four hours, and left both his patient and the worried companion more at ease than he had found them.</t4325>
<t4326>Mrs. Jennings learned of what had happened in the morning, showing great concern and reproaching them for not having called her to help.</t4326> <t4327>Her old fears, now revived with much better basis, left her in no doubt about what had occurred; and although she tried to console Elinor, her certainty about the danger her sister was in did not allow her to offer the comfort of hope.</t4327> <t4328>Her heart was truly heavy.</t4328> <t4329>The rapid decline, the early death of such a young, so adorable girl as Marianne, could have affected even a less close person.</t4329> <t4330>But Marianne could expect more from Mrs. Jennings' compassion.</t4330> <t4331>For three months she had kept her company, she was still under her care, and it was known that she had been deeply hurt and had suffered for a long time.</t4331> <t4332>She also saw the anguish of the sister, who was especially her favorite; and as for her mother, when Mrs. Jennings thought that Marianne would probably be to her what Charlotte was to herself, she felt genuine compassion for her sufferings.</t4332>
<t4333>Mr. Harris was punctual on his second visit, but the hopes he had placed in the effects of the previous one were frustrated.</t4333> <t4334>His medications had failed; the fever had not been conquered; and Marianne, only more tranquil —not more in control of herself— remained in a dense stupor.</t4334> <t4335>Elinor, capturing all, and more than all her fears in a single instant, proposed seeking further advice.</t4335> <t4336>But he deemed it unnecessary; he still had something more to try, a new prescription in which he had as much confidence as in the last one, and his visit concluded with encouraging words of assurance that reached Miss Dashwood's ears but did not manage to reach her heart.</t4336> <t4337>Though she remained calm, except when she thought of her mother, she had almost lost hope; and in this state she continued until midday, barely moving from her sister's side, her mind jumping from one image of pain to another, from one distressed friend to another, her spirit utterly dejected by Mrs. Jennings' conversation, who had no qualms about attributing the severity and danger of this disorder to the many weeks Marianne had previously been indisposed due to her disappointment.</t4337> <t4338>Elinor felt how reasonable that idea was, and it added a new pain to her reflections.</t4338>
<t4339>Around noon, however, she began —though with a caution, a fear of false hope that kept her silent for a while, even in front of her friend— to imagine, to hope that she was perceiving a slight improvement in her sister's pulse; she waited, watched, examined it over and over again; and finally, with an agitation more difficult to hide under a calm exterior than all her previous anguish, she dared to communicate her hopes.</t4339> <t4340>Mrs. Jennings, though obliged after an examination to acknowledge a temporary recovery, tried to make her young friend avoid giving in to the idea that it would continue this way; and Elinor, mentally going over all the arguments that recommended distrust, also told herself that she should not foster hopes.</t4340> <t4341>But it was too late.</t4341> <t4342>Hope had already made its entrance; and she, feeling its anxious fluttering, leaned over her sister to wait... she no longer knew for what.</t4342> <t4343>Half an hour passed, and the favorable symptoms continued to bless her.</t4343> <t4344>Others even appeared, confirming them.</t4344> <t4345>Her breathing, her skin, her lips, all appealed to Elinor with signs of improvement, and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational, though languid, look.</t4345> <t4346>Anxiety and hope besieged her in equal measure, preventing her from a moment of tranquility until Mr. Harris arrived at four, when the assurances he gave, his congratulations on a recovery of her sister that even exceeded his expectations, gave her confidence and comfort, and she could let tears of joy flow.</t4346>
<t4347>Marianne was noticeably better in every way, and Mr. Harris declared her completely out of danger.</t4347> <t4348>Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied because her predictions had received partial justification in the last alarm they had experienced, allowed herself to trust the apothecary's judgment and admitted with genuine joy, and soon with undeniable delight, the probability of a full recovery.</t4348>
<t4349>Elinor could not be cheerful.</t4349> <t4350>Her joy was of a different kind, and it led to something very different from cheerfulness.</t4350> <t4351>Marianne returned to life, to health, to friends, and to her loving mother, was an idea that filled her heart with exquisite comfort and expanded it in fervent gratitude; but it did not manifest in outward displays of cheerfulness, nor in words or smiles.</t4351> <t4352>All that Elinor's heart harbored was quiet and strong satisfaction.</t4352>
<t4353>She stayed by her sister's side with few breaks all afternoon, calming each of her fears, answering each of the questions from her weakened spirit, providing all the necessary assistance, and watching almost every glance and every breath.</t4353> <t4354>Of course, at times the possibility of a relapse came to mind, reminding her of what anxiety was; but when her frequent and thorough examinations showed her that all the symptoms of recovery continued, and at six she saw Marianne fall into a peaceful, uninterrupted, and by all appearances, comfortable sleep, she silenced all her doubts.</t4354>
<t4355>The moment when Colonel Brandon's return could be expected was already approaching.</t4355> <t4356>At ten o'clock, Elinor believed, or not much later, her mother would be freed from the terrible suspense with which she must now be traveling towards them.</t4356> <t4357>Perhaps the colonel was also only a little less deserving of pity!</t4357> <t4358>Ah, how slowly time passed that still kept them in ignorance!</t4358>
<t4359>At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still in a sweet slumber, she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing room for tea.</t4359> <t4360>Her fears had kept her from being able to eat breakfast, and at dinner the sudden turn of events had prevented her from eating much; the current refreshment, then, with the feelings of joy with which Elinor approached it, was very especially well received.</t4360> <t4361>When they finished, Mrs. Jennings wanted to convince her to rest a bit before her mother arrived, and allow her to take her place next to Marianne; but Elinor neither felt tired nor capable of sleeping, and she was not going to allow herself to be kept away from her sister for even an instant.</t4361> <t4362>Mrs. Jennings then went up with her to the sickroom to ensure everything was still well, left her there dedicated to her task and her thoughts, and retired to her rooms to write some letters and then to sleep.</t4362>
<t4363>The night was cold and stormy.</t4363> <t4364>If it had been ten o'clock, Elinor would have been sure that at that moment she heard a carriage approaching the house; and her certainty of having heard it was so great, despite it being almost impossible for them to have arrived already, that she went to the small sitting room next to the room and opened a shutter to verify the truth.</t4364> <t4365>Immediately, she saw that her ears had not deceived her.</t4365> <t4366>She instantly saw the glow of the carriage's lanterns.</t4366> <t4367>In its uncertain light, it seemed to her that it was being pulled by four horses; and this, although it was a sign of her mother's enormous fear, partly explained such unexpected speed.</t4367>
<t4368>Never in her life had Elinor found it more difficult to remain calm.</t4368> <t4369>Knowing what her mother must be feeling at the moment the carriage stopped at the door... her doubts, her fear, perhaps her despair!, and what she must say!... knowing that made it impossible to stay calm.</t4369> <t4370>All that was left to do was to hurry; and so, staying only until she could leave Mrs. Jennings' maid with her sister, she ran downstairs.</t4370>
<t4371>The hustle and bustle he heard in the lobby while.</t4371> <t4372>passing through an inner hall, confirmed to him that they were already in the house.</t4372> <t4373>He hurried towards the living room, entered... and there he saw only Willoughby.</t4373>
<t4374>CHAPTER XLIV</t4374>
<t4375>Elinor, recoiling with a look of horror upon seeing him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart and turned hastily to leave the room; her hand was already on the door handle when Willoughby stopped her by advancing quickly towards her and saying, in a tone more imperative than pleading:</t4375>
<t4376>—Miss Dashwood, half an hour... ten minutes... I beg you to stay.</t4376>
<t4377>—No, sir —she replied firmly—, I will not stay.</t4377> <t4378>I have nothing to do with your affairs.</t4378> <t4379>I suppose the servants forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not at home.</t4379>
<t4380>—Even if they had told me —he exclaimed with great vehemence— that Mr. Palmer and all his kin were in hell, they would not have moved me from the door.</t4380> <t4381>It is with you that I want to speak, only with you.</t4381>
<t4382>—With me! —there was enormous astonishment in his voice—.</t4382> <t4383>Alright, sir... be quick, and if possible, less vehement.</t4383>
<t4384>—Sit down, and I will obey both orders.</t4384>
<t4385>Elinor hesitated; she did not know what to do.</t4385> <t4386>The possibility that Colonel Brandon might arrive and find him there crossed her mind.</t4386> <t4387>But she had promised to listen to him, and her curiosity was as much at stake as her honor.</t4387> <t4388>After a moment of reflection, then, which led her to conclude that prudence required haste and that her consent was the best way to achieve it, she walked silently to the table and sat down.</t4388> <t4389>He took a seat opposite her, and for half a minute they did not exchange a word.</t4389>
<t4390>—Please be quick, sir —Elinor said impatiently—, I have no time to lose.</t4390>
<t4391>Sitting with an air of deep meditation, he seemed not to have heard her.</t4391>
<t4392>—Your sister —he said abruptly a moment later— is out of danger.</t4392> <t4393>The servant told me.</t4393> <t4394>Thank God!</t4394> <t4395>But, is it true? Is it really true?</t4395>
<t4396>Elinor did not respond to him.</t4396> <t4397>He then repeated the question, with even greater urgency.</t4397>
<t4398>—For the love of God, tell me: is he out of danger or not?</t4398>
<t4399>—We hope that you are.</t4399>
<t4400>Willoughby stood up and crossed the room.</t4400>
<t4401>—If I had known just half an hour earlier...</t4401> <t4402>But since I am here —he spoke with forced vivacity as he returned to the table—, what does it matter?</t4402> <t4403>For this time, Miss Dashwood... perhaps it will be the last time... let us be happy together.</t4403> <t4404>I am in the mood for joy.</t4404> <t4405>Tell me sincerely —his cheeks flushed a deeper shade— do you think I am more of a scoundrel or a fool?</t4405>
<t4406>Elinor contemplated him more astonished than ever.</t4406> <t4407>She began to think that he must be drunk: it was the only thing that could explain such a strange visit, such unusual manners; and with this impression, she immediately stood up, saying:</t4407>
<t4408>—Mr. Willoughby, I would advise you at this moment to return to Combe.</t4408> <t4409>I cannot continue wasting time with you.</t4409> <t4410>Whatever it is you wish to discuss with me, it would be better if you reflect and explain it to me tomorrow.</t4410>
<t4411>—I understand you —he replied with an expressive smile and a perfectly calm voice—.</t4411> <t4412>Yes, I am very drunk.</t4412> <t4413>A pint of beer that I had with the cold meats I ate in Marlborough was enough to upset me.</t4413>
<t4414>—In Marlborough! —exclaimed Elinor, understanding less and less what was happening.</t4414>
<t4415>—Yes; I left London today at eight in the morning and the only ten minutes I spent out of my chaise since that time were those I dedicated to a light snack in Marlborough.</t4415>
<t4416>The firmness of his manners and the intelligence of his gaze while he spoke convinced Elinor that, whatever the unforgivable madness that brought him to Cleveland, it was not drunkenness; and after thinking for a few moments, she said:</t4416>
<t4417>—Mr. Willoughby, you must realize, and I certainly believe so, that after everything that has happened, your coming here and the manner in which you have done so, imposing your presence on me, require a very special excuse.</t4417> <t4418>What do you intend with this?</t4418>
<t4419>—What I intend —said the young man with a gravely energetic tone—, if I can, is to make you hate me a little less than you do now.</t4419> <t4420>I intend to offer some explanation, some apology for what happened in the past; to open my heart to you and convince you that although I have always been good for nothing, I have not always been a scoundrel; and, in this way, to obtain something akin to the forgiveness of Ma... of your sister.</t4420>
<t4421>Is that the real reason that brought you here?</t4421>
<t4422>—By my life, it is —was his response, said with a fervor that brought to Elinor's mind everything that the old Willoughby had been, and despite herself, made her believe him sincere.</t4422>
<t4423>—If that is all, you can be satisfied, for Marianne has... forgiven you a long time ago.</t4423>
<t4424>—He has done it! —exclaimed the young man, with the same intense tone—.</t4424> <t4425>Then he has forgiven me before he should have done so.</t4425> <t4426>But he will forgive me again, and this time for much more valid reasons.</t4426> <t4427>Now, will he want to listen to me?</t4427>
<t4428>Elinor nodded her head.</t4428>
<t4429>—I don't know —he said, after a pause filled with expectation on Elinor's part, and with contemplation on his—, how you might have explained my behavior towards your sister, or what diabolical motives you might have attributed to me.</t4429> <t4430>It may be difficult for you to think better of me; however, it is worth trying, and I will tell you everything.</t4430> <t4431>At the beginning of my acquaintance with your family, I had no other intention, no other interest in the relationship than to spend pleasant moments during my forced stay in Devonshire, more pleasant than those I had enjoyed until then.</t4431> <t4432>Your sister, with her adorable appearance and attractive manners, could not fail to enchant me; and her treatment towards me, almost from the beginning, was...</t4432> <t4433>It is incredible, when I think about how her treatment was, and how she was, that my heart could have been so insensitive!</t4433> <t4434>But at the beginning, I must confess, it only flattered my vanity.</t4434> <t4435>Without worrying about her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement, allowing myself feelings that I had been accustomed to indulge all my life, I endeavored by all means at my disposal to make myself agreeable to her, with no intention of reciprocating her affection.</t4435>
<t4436>At this point, Miss Dashwood, casting him a look of the utmost angry disdain, stopped him by saying:</t4436>
<t4437>—It's not worth it, Mr. Willoughby, for you to keep talking, or for me to keep listening.</t4437> <t4438>Nothing can follow such a beginning.</t4438> <t4439>Do not distress me by making me hear more about this matter.</t4439>
<t4440>—I insist that you listen to everything —he replied—.</t4440> <t4441>I was never the owner of a great fortune and I have always had expensive tastes, I have always associated with people of higher incomes than mine.</t4441> <t4442>Since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, year after year my debts have increased; and although the death of my elderly cousin, Mrs. Smith, would free me from them, given that it is an uncertain and possibly very distant event, for some time I had intended to rebuild my situation through marriage to a wealthy woman.</t4442> <t4443>A relationship with your sister was, therefore, unthinkable; and thus I found myself acting with a baseness, selfishness, and cruelty that no look of indignation or contempt, not even yours, Miss Dashwood, could sufficiently censure, and always with the purpose of winning her affection, without any intention of reciprocating it.</t4443> <t4444>But there is one thing that can be said in my favor, even in that horrendous state of selfish vanity, and that is that I did not know the depth of the harm I was plotting, because at that time I did not know what it was to love.</t4444> <t4445>But, have I ever known it?</t4445> <t4446>It can well be doubted, for if I had truly loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to greed?</t4446> <t4447>Or, worse still, could I have sacrificed hers?</t4447> <t4448>But I have done so.</t4448> <t4449>To avoid a relative poverty, which her affection and company would have stripped of all its horrors, I have lost, by elevating myself to a position of fortune, everything that would have made it a blessing.</t4449>
<t4450>—Then —said Elinor, somewhat appeased—, he did feel attached to her for a while.</t4450>
<t4451>—To have resisted so many attractions, to have rejected such tenderness!</t4451> <t4452>What man in the world would have done it!</t4452> <t4453>Yes, little by little, without realizing it, I found myself sincerely in love with her; and the happiest hours of my life were those I spent with her, when I felt that my intentions were strictly honorable and my feelings impeccable.</t4453> <t4454>Even then, however, when I was completely decided to declare my love to her, I allowed myself against all decorum to postpone day by day the moment of doing so, driven by my reluctance to establish a commitment while I was still in such great financial distress.</t4454> <t4455>I am not going to justify this... nor will I stop you if you want to elaborate on the absurdity, and worse than absurdity, of hesitating to commit my word where my honor was already committed.</t4455> <t4456>The facts have shown how foolishly cunning I was, working so hard to give myself the possibility of becoming despicable and miserable forever.</t4456> <t4457>Finally, however, I resolved and decided that at the first opportunity I could speak to her alone, I would justify the attentions I had continually lavished on her and openly declare an affection that I had already done so much to show her.</t4457> <t4458>But in the meantime, in the interval of the few hours that would pass before I had the opportunity to speak with her in private, something happened, an unfortunate circumstance that destroyed all my resolution and, with it, all my well-being.</t4458> <t4459>Something was discovered —here he hesitated and lowered his eyes—.</t4459> <t4460>Mrs. Smith had learned, in one way or another, I imagine through some distant relative who wanted to deprive me of her favor, about a matter, a relationship... but it is not necessary for me to elaborate on that —he added, looking at her blushing and with an interrogative air—, through your intimate friendship... you are probably aware of the whole story for a long time.</t4460>
<t4461>—I am —replied Elinor, also blushing, and hardening her heart once again against any feeling of compassion towards him—, I am aware of everything.</t4461> <t4462>And how you could excuse even the smallest part of your guilt in that atrocious matter with your explanations is beyond what I can imagine.</t4462>
<t4463>"Remember," exclaimed Willoughby, "by whose mouth that story reached you."</t4463> <t4464>Could it possibly be impartial?</t4464> <t4465>I admit that I should have respected the condition and the person of that young woman herself.</t4465> <t4466>It is not my intention to justify myself, but neither can I allow you to suppose that I have nothing to argue; that because she suffered, she was blameless; and that because I was a libertine, she had to be a saint.</t4466> <t4467>If the vehemence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding... but I do not want to defend myself.</t4467> <t4468>Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often remember with enormous feelings of guilt that tenderness which for a very brief period had the power to create in me a response.</t4468> <t4469>How I wish, with all my heart, that it had never happened.</t4469> <t4470>But the damage I did to myself is greater than hers; and I have harmed someone whose affection for me (can I say it?) was only slightly less ardent than hers, and whose intelligence...</t4470> <t4471>Ah! How infinitely superior!</t4471>
<t4472>—But your indifference towards that unfortunate girl..., I must say it, as unpleasant as it is for me to discuss a matter like this..., your indifference is no excuse for the cruel way in which you abandoned her.</t4472> <t4473>Do not imagine that any weakness, any natural lack of understanding on her part, excuses the insensitive cruelty you displayed.</t4473> <t4474>You must have known that while you were amusing yourself in Devonshire with new plans, always cheerful, always happy, she was reduced to the most total destitution.</t4474>
<t4475>—But, I give you my word, I didn't know it —replied Willoughby with enormous vehemence—; I didn't remember not having given you my address, and simple common sense should have indicated to you how to find it.</t4475>
<t4476>—Well, sir, and what did Mrs. Smith say?</t4476>
<t4477>—Immediately, she censured the offense I had committed, and it can be deduced how great my confusion was.</t4477> <t4478>The purity of her life, her conventional ideas, her ignorance of the world... everything was against me.</t4478> <t4479>I could not deny the matter, and all my efforts to soften it were in vain.</t4479> <t4480>She was predisposed beforehand, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in general, and moreover, she was displeased with the very little attention, the brief time I had dedicated to her during that visit of mine.</t4480> <t4481>In short, it ended in a total rupture.</t4481> <t4482>One thing alone could have saved me.</t4482> <t4483>In the extremity of her morality, poor woman!, she offered to forget the past if I married Eliza.</t4483> <t4484>That was unthinkable... and so I was formally expelled from her favor and her house.</t4484> <t4485>I was to leave there the next morning, and the previous night I spent reflecting on what my future conduct should be.</t4485> <t4486>The struggle was great..., but it ended too soon.</t4486> <t4487>My affection for Marianne, my total certainty about her love, all was insufficient to counteract the fear of poverty, or to make a dent in those false ideas about the necessity of wealth that were so natural to me, and that a lavish society had taught me to cultivate.</t4487> <t4488>I had reasons to believe myself assured of the acceptance of my current wife, if I chose her, and I managed to persuade myself that this was the only course that common prudence advised.</t4488> <t4489>Still, however, a difficult situation awaited me before I could leave Devonshire; I was committed to dine with you that very day and, therefore, needed an excuse to miss that engagement.</t4489> <t4490>I wrestled for a long time between writing that excuse or presenting it in person.</t4490> <t4491>I felt it would be terrible to see Marianne, and I even doubted whether I could see her again and still be able to persist in my decision.</t4491> <t4492>At that point, however, I underestimated my own capacity, as has been demonstrated by the facts; for I went, I saw her, saw that she was unhappy, and I left her unhappy... and I left, hoping never to see her again.</t4492>
<t4493>—But why was it, Mr. Willoughby? —said Elinor, with a tone of reproach—.</t4493> <t4494>A note would have sufficed.</t4494> <t4495>Why was it necessary to go in person?</t4495>
<t4496>—It was necessary for my pride.</t4496> <t4497>I could not bear to leave there in a way that would allow you, or the rest of the neighbors, to suspect anything of what had really happened between Mrs. Smith and me, and I then decided to stop by your house on my way to Honiton.</t4497> <t4498>Seeing your dear sister, however, was terrible; and to make matters worse, I found her alone.</t4498> <t4499>You had gone out, I don't know where.</t4499> <t4500>Just the previous afternoon I had left her so completely and firmly resolved within myself to do the right thing!</t4500> <t4501>In a few hours we would have been committed forever; and I remember how happy, how joyful I felt as I went from the house to Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with everyone!</t4501> <t4502>But in that meeting, the last of our friendship, I came to her with a feeling of guilt that almost took away all my ability to pretend.</t4502> <t4503>Her pain, her disappointment, her deep sorrow when I told her I had to leave Devonshire so suddenly... I will never forget them.</t4503> <t4504>And that combined with so much faith, so much trust in me!</t4504> <t4505>Oh, God!</t4505> <t4506>What a heartless scoundrel I was!</t4506>
<t4507>They both fell silent for a few moments.</t4507> <t4508>Elinor was the first to speak.</t4508>
<t4509>—Did he say he would return soon?</t4509>
<t4510>—I don't know what I told her —he replied, impatiently—; less than what the past demanded of me, without a doubt, and in all probability much more than what the future justified.</t4510> <t4511>I can't think about that... it will be of no use.</t4511> <t4512>And then came his dear mother, to torture me even more with all her kindness and trust.</t4512> <t4513>Thank God she did torture me!</t4513> <t4514>How miserable I felt!</t4514> <t4515>Miss Dashwood, you cannot imagine what a comfort it is to look back and see how miserable I felt.</t4515> <t4516>The resentment I hold against myself for the stupid, scoundrelly madness of my own heart is so immense that all the sufferings I had in the past because of it are now nothing but feelings of triumph and joy.</t4516> <t4517>In short, I went, abandoned everything I loved, and headed towards those for whom, at best, I felt only indifference.</t4517> <t4518>My trip to the city, in my own carriage, so tedious, with no one to talk to... what cheerful thoughts, what pleasant prospects ahead!</t4518> <t4519>And when I remembered Barton, what a consoling image!</t4519> <t4520>Ah, yes, it was a splendid trip!</t4520>
<t4521>He stopped.</t4521>
<t4522>—In short, sir —said Elinor, who, although feeling sorry for him, was growing impatient to see him leave—, is that all?</t4522>
<t4523>—Everything! No.</t4523> <t4524>Have you perhaps forgotten what happened in the city?</t4524> <t4525>That infamous letter! Did you show it to her?</t4525>
<t4526>—Yes, I saw all the notes that were written.</t4526>
<t4527>—When I received the first one (which reached me immediately, as I was in the city the entire time), what I felt was, as they commonly say, impossible to express.</t4527> <t4528>In simpler words, perhaps too simple to evoke any emotion, my feelings were very, very painful.</t4528> <t4529>Every line, every word was, in the clichéd phrase that her dear author would forbid if she were here, a stab in my heart.</t4529> <t4530>Knowing that Marianne was in the city was, in the same language, a lightning bolt.</t4530> <t4531>Lightning bolts and stabs!</t4531> <t4532>How she would have reprimanded me!</t4532> <t4533>Her taste, her opinions... I think I know them better than my own, and I certainly appreciate them more.</t4533>
<t4534>Elinor's heart, which had run through a whole range of emotions during the course of this extraordinary conversation, softened once more; even so, she felt it was her duty to restrain in her companion ideas like the last one he had expressed.</t4534>
<t4535>—That is not right, Mr. Willoughby.</t4535> <t4536>Remember that you are married.</t4536> <t4537>Speak to me only of that which your conscience deems necessary for me to hear.</t4537>
<t4538>—Marianne's note, in which she told me that I was still as dear to her as before; that despite the many, many weeks we had been apart, she remained as faithful in her feelings and as full of confidence in the fidelity of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse.</t4538> <t4539>I say it awakened them, because time and London, occupations and dissipation, had somehow lulled them to sleep and had been transforming me into a completely hardened villain, making me believe I was indifferent to her and choosing to believe that she must have become indifferent to me as well; telling myself that our relationship in the past had been nothing more than a pastime, a trivial affair; shrugging my shoulders as proof of it, and silencing all reproach, overcoming all scruples with the resource of silently telling myself from time to time, “I will be wholeheartedly happy when I know she is well married.”</t4539> <t4540>But her note made me know myself better.</t4540> <t4541>I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world, and that I was behaving towards her in the most infamous manner.</t4541> <t4542>But by then everything was already settled between Miss Grey and me.</t4542> <t4543>Turning back was impossible.</t4543> <t4544>All I had to do was avoid both of you.</t4544> <t4545>I did not reply to Marianne, attempting by that means to prevent her from noticing me again; and for some time I was even determined not to go to Berkeley Street; but, finally, judging it wiser to pretend it was only a cold and ordinary relationship, I waited one morning until you had left the house and left my card.</t4545>
<t4546>—He waited for us to leave the house!</t4546>
<t4547>—Yes, even that.</t4547> <t4548>You would be surprised to know how often I saw you, how many times I was about to run into you.</t4548> <t4549>I entered countless shops to avoid being seen from the carriage you were in.</t4549> <t4550>Living on Bond Street as I did, there was hardly a day when I didn't catch sight of one of you; and the only thing that kept us apart for so long was my constant vigilance, a constant and imperative desire to stay out of your sight.</t4550> <t4551>I avoided the Middletons as much as I could, as well as anyone who might be mutual acquaintances.</t4551> <t4552>But without knowing you were in town, I ran into Sir John, I believe, the day he arrived, the day after my visit to Mrs. Jennings' house.</t4552> <t4553>He invited me to a party, a ball at his house that night.</t4553> <t4554>Even if he hadn't told me to convince me that you and your sister would be there, I would have felt it was too likely to dare to go.</t4554> <t4555>The next morning brought another brief note from Marianne, still affectionate, frank, naive, trusting... everything that could make my conduct more odious.</t4555> <t4556>I couldn't respond to her.</t4556> <t4557>I tried, and I couldn't write a single sentence.</t4557> <t4558>But I don't think there was a moment of the day when I didn't think of her.</t4558> <t4559>If you can pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was then.</t4559> <t4560>With my mind and heart full of your sister, I had to play the part of a happy lover in front of another woman!</t4560> <t4561>Those three or four weeks were the worst of all.</t4561> <t4562>And so, finally, as I don't need to tell you, we inevitably met.</t4562> <t4563>And what a sweet image I rejected!</t4563> <t4564>What a night of agony that was!</t4564> <t4565>On one side, Marianne, beautiful as an angel, saying my name with such sweet accents!</t4565> <t4566>Oh, God!</t4566> <t4567>Reaching out her hand, asking me for an explanation with those enchanting eyes fixed on my face with such expressive solicitude!</t4567> <t4568>And Sophia, jealous as the devil, on the other side, watching everything...</t4568> <t4569>In the end, what does it matter now; it's all over.'</t4569> <t4570>What a night that was!</t4570> <t4571>I fled from you as soon as I could, but not before seeing Marianne's sweet face as white as death.</t4571> <t4572>That was the last time I saw her, the last image I have of her.</t4572> <t4573>It was a terrible vision!</t4573> <t4574>But when today I imagined her truly dying, it was a kind of relief to think that I knew exactly how she would appear to those who would see her last in this world.</t4574> <t4575>I had her before me, always before me all the way, with the same face and the same color.</t4575>
<t4576>This was followed by a brief pause in which both remained silent, thoughtful.</t4576> <t4577>Willoughby, rising first, broke it by saying:</t4577>
<t4578>—Well, I must hurry and leave.</t4578> <t4579>Are you sure your sister is better, out of danger?</t4579> <t4580>—Yes, we are sure.</t4580>
<t4581>—Also her poor mother, with how much she adores Marianne!</t4581>
<t4582>—But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; don't you have anything to say about it?</t4582>
<t4583>—Yes, yes, that one in particular.</t4583> <t4584>Her sister wrote to me the very next morning, as you know.</t4584> <t4585>You already know what it said there.</t4585> <t4586>I was having breakfast at the Ellison's; and from the place where I was staying, they brought me her letter, along with others.</t4586> <t4587>And it so happened that Sophia saw it before I did; and its bearing, the elegance of the paper, the handwriting, all immediately aroused her suspicions.</t4587> <t4588>She had already received vague reports about a relationship of mine with a young woman in Devonshire, and what had happened the previous night before her eyes had indicated who the young woman was, making her more jealous than ever.</t4588> <t4589>Pretending then that playful air that is delightful in the woman one loves, she opened the letter herself and read its contents.</t4589> <t4590>It was a good reward for her audacity.</t4590> <t4591>She read the words that made her unhappy.</t4591> <t4592>I could have endured her unhappiness, but her anger, her rancor, had to be calmed somehow.</t4592> <t4593>And so, what do you think of my wife's epistolary style?</t4593> <t4594>Delicate, tender, truly feminine, right?</t4594>
<t4595>—His wife!</t4595> <t4596>But the letter was in his own handwriting.</t4596>
<t4597>—Yes, but my only credit is having servilely copied phrases that I was ashamed to sign.</t4597> <t4598>The original was entirely hers, her own happy ideas and gentle writing.</t4598> <t4599>But, what could I do?</t4599> <t4600>We were engaged, they were preparing everything, they had almost set the date... but I speak like a fool.</t4600> <t4601>Preparations! Date!</t4601> <t4602>To speak sincerely, I needed her money, and in a situation like mine, I had to do anything to avoid a breakup.</t4602> <t4603>And after all, what importance could Mariani and her friends' opinion of my character have, the language in which my response was formulated?</t4603> <t4604>It had to serve a single purpose.</t4604> <t4605>I had to show myself as a villain, and it didn't matter whether I did it with a bow or bravado.</t4605> <t4606>“My reputation with them is ruined forever,” I told myself; “I am forever banished from their side; they already believe me to be a man without principles, this letter will merely make them think of me as a scoundrel.”</t4606> <t4607>Such were my thoughts while, in a kind of desperate indifference, I copied my wife's words and parted with the last relics of Marianne.</t4607> <t4608>Her three letters, unfortunately, I kept them in my wallet, or I could have denied their existence and kept them as a treasure forever.</t4608> <t4609>I had to include them, and I couldn't even kiss them.</t4609> <t4610>And the lock of her hair, I had also always carried it with me in my wallet, which the lady now searched with the most captivating virulence...</t4610> <t4611>That dear lock... everything, every memory was torn from me.</t4611>
<t4612>—You are very mistaken, Mr. Willoughby, your words are very reprehensible —said Elinor, while her voice, despite herself, betrayed the compassion she felt—; you should not speak in this way, neither about Mrs. Willoughby nor my sister.</t4612> <t4613>You made your own choice.</t4613> <t4614>No one imposed it on you.</t4614> <t4615>Your wife has the right to your kindness, to your respect at least.</t4615> <t4616>She must love you, or she would not have married you.</t4616> <t4617>Treating her discourteously, speaking of her disdainfully, does not make amends for what was done to Marianne, nor do I believe it eases your own conscience.</t4617>
<t4618>—Do not speak to me about my wife —he said, with a deep sigh—.</t4618> <t4619>She does not deserve your compassion.</t4619> <t4620>I knew I did not love her when we got married.</t4620> <t4621>Well, we got married, we came to Combe Magna seeking happiness, and then we returned to the city seeking joy.</t4621> <t4622>And now, do you pity me, Miss Dashwood? Or have I said all this in vain?</t4622> <t4623>In your opinion, am I, even if only a little, less guilty than before?</t4623> <t4624>My intentions were not always wrong.</t4624> <t4625>Have I justified any of my guilt?</t4625>
<t4626>—Yes, it certainly has removed something from her, a small part.</t4626> <t4627>She has proven to be, in general, less guilty than I had believed.</t4627> <t4628>She has shown that her heart is less wicked, much less wicked.</t4628> <t4629>But it is difficult for me to know, regarding the unhappiness she has caused, it is difficult for me to know how it could have been worse.</t4629>
<t4630>—Will you tell your sister, when she has recovered, what I have said to you?</t4630> <t4631>Allow me to lighten my guilt a little in her opinion as well.</t4631> <t4632>She tells me that she has already forgiven me.</t4632> <t4633>Allow me to believe that a better understanding of my heart, of my current feelings, will elicit from her a more spontaneous, more natural, sweeter, less lordly forgiveness.</t4633> <t4634>Tell her of my misfortune and my repentance, tell her that my heart was never unfaithful to her, and if she wishes, that she is dearer to me now than ever.</t4634>
<t4635>—I will tell you everything that is necessary for what, relatively, can be called his justification.</t4635> <t4636>But he has not explained to me the specific reason for his current visit, nor how he learned of his illness.</t4636>
<t4637>—Last night, in the foyer of Drury Lane, I ran into Sir John Middleton, and when he saw who it was (our first meeting in these two months), he spoke to me.</t4637> <t4638>That he had cut ties with me since my marriage did not cause me surprise or resentment.</t4638> <t4639>At that moment, however, with his good, honest, and foolish soul, filled with indignation against me and concern for his sister, he could not resist the temptation to tell me what he thought he should, although he did not think it would affect me so terribly.</t4639> <t4640>As abruptly as he could, then, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever in Cleveland; a letter from Mrs. Jennings received that morning announced that the danger was imminent, fear had driven the Palmers away, etc.</t4640> <t4641>The blow was too strong to allow me to feign insensitivity, even before the not very perceptive Sir John.</t4641> <t4642>His heart softened upon seeing how mine suffered; and such a large part of his rancor had vanished when we parted, that he almost shook my hand, while reminding me of an old promise about a pointer puppy.</t4642> <t4643>What I felt upon hearing that his sister was dying, and dying believing me to be the greatest villain in the world, despising me, hating me in her final moments... because, how could I know what horrendous plans they might have attributed to me?</t4643> <t4644>I was sure that at least one person could make me appear capable of anything.</t4644> <t4645>What I felt was atrocious!</t4645> <t4646>I quickly made a decision, and today at eight in the morning I was already in my carriage.</t4646> <t4647>Now you know everything.</t4647>
<t4648>Elinor did not respond.</t4648> <t4649>Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable damage that too early an independence, and the consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had caused in the mind, character, and happiness of a man who, to all the advantages of good looks and talents, added a naturally frank and honest disposition, and a sensitive and affectionate temperament.</t4649> <t4650>The world had made him extravagant and vain; extravagance and vanity had made him insensitive and selfish.</t4650> <t4651>Vanity, while Willoughby sacrificed another for the sake of his own guilty triumph, had involved him in a genuine affection which extravagance—or at least its offspring, necessity—had demanded he renounce.</t4651> <t4652>Each of these defects, in leading him to wrongdoing, had also led him to punishment.</t4652> <t4653>The affection that against all honor, against his feelings, against his best interests he had apparently wanted to tear from himself, now, when it was no longer permitted to him, dominated all his thoughts; and the union for whose sake, without any scruple, he had made her sister unhappy, seemed to have transformed into a source of much more incurable unhappiness for himself.</t4653> <t4654>From this reverie she was drawn after a few minutes by Willoughby, who, coming out of a reverie at least equally painful, stood up preparing to leave and said:</t4654>
<t4655>—It's no use staying here; I must leave.</t4655>
<t4656>Is he/she/it returning to the city?</t4656>
<t4657>—No, to Combe Magna.</t4657> <t4658>I have something to do there; in one or two more days I will head to the city.</t4658> <t4659>Goodbye.</t4659>
<t4660>He extended his hand.</t4660> <t4661>She couldn't refuse to give him hers; he shook it affectionately.</t4661>
<t4662>—But, do you think better of me now? —he said, releasing her and leaning on the mantelpiece, as if he had forgotten that he was about to leave.</t4662>
<t4663>Elinor assured her that it was so; that she forgave him, sympathized with him, wished him the best, even that he would be happy, to which she added a gentle piece of advice on the most appropriate behavior to achieve it.</t4663> <t4664>Her response was not very encouraging.</t4664>
<t4665>—As for that —he said—, I will have to manage as best as I can.</t4665> <t4666>I can't even think about domestic happiness.</t4666> <t4667>However, if you and your family have any interest in my fate and my actions, it may be the way... it may warn me... at least, it may be something to live for.</t4667> <t4668>Marianne, in any case, I have lost her forever.</t4668> <t4669>Even if, by some blessed chance, I found myself free again...</t4669>
<t4670>Elinor stopped him with a reproach.</t4670>
<t4671>—Well —he said—, once again, goodbye.</t4671> <t4672>I will leave now and live in fear that only one thing will happen.</t4672> <t4673>—What do you mean?</t4673>
<t4674>—To his sister's wedding.</t4674>
<t4675>—You are very mistaken.</t4675> <t4676>It will never be more out of your reach than it is now.</t4676>
<t4677>—But it will be someone else's.</t4677> <t4678>And if that someone else were the one I can least tolerate among all men...</t4678> <t4679>But I will not stay to deprive myself of all his compassionate goodwill by showing him that where I have caused the most harm, I can forgive the least.</t4679> <t4680>Goodbye, may God bless you!</t4680>
<t4681>And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.</t4681>
<t4682>CHAPTER XLV</t4682>
<t4683>For a good while after Willoughby's departure, even after the sound of his carriage had faded into the distance, Elinor remained too overwhelmed by a swarm of very different thoughts, but whose overall result was sadness, to even think about her sister.</t4683>
<t4684>Willoughby, the same man whom she had despised as the most contemptible of men just half an hour ago; Willoughby, despite all his flaws, aroused in her such compassion for the sufferings that those very flaws had produced, that now made her think of him, forever separated from his family, with a tenderness, with a sorrow more proportionate, as she soon recognized to herself, to her desires than to his merits.</t4684> <t4685>She felt that his influence over her was increased by circumstances that reasonably should not have mattered: by the uncommon attractiveness of his appearance; by his frank, affectionate, and lively manners, which there is no merit in possessing; and by that still fervent love for Marianne, in which she was not even innocent to take pleasure.</t4685> <t4686>But she felt all this much, much before she felt his influence weaken.</t4686>
<t4687>When he finally returned to the unconscious Marianne, he found her just waking up, renewed by such a long and sweet sleep, just as he had hoped.</t4687> <t4688>Elinor's heart was filled to the brim.</t4688> <t4689>The past, the present, the future; Willoughby's visit, seeing Marianne safe, and the anticipated arrival of her mother, filled her with an agitation that prevented any sign of fatigue and made her fear only that she might betray herself in front of her sister.</t4689> <t4690>However, the time in which this fear affected her was short, for before half an hour had passed since Willoughby's departure, the noise of another carriage made her go downstairs again.</t4690> <t4691>Anxious to spare her mother unnecessary moments of terrible suspense, she immediately ran to the hall and reached the front door just in time to receive her and support her as she entered.</t4691>
<t4692>Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they approached the house had almost convinced her that Marianne had already ceased to exist, could not find her voice to ask about her, nor even to address Elinor; but the latter, without waiting for greetings or questions, immediately gave her the good news; and her mother, taking it with her usual vehemence, was in a moment as overwhelmed by happiness as she had previously been by her fears.</t4692> <t4693>Between her daughter and her daughter's friend, they supported her until they brought her to the living room; and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to speak, she embraced Elinor again and again, separating from her at intervals to clasp Colonel Brandon's hand with a look that expressed both her gratitude and her certainty that he shared in the joy of the moment.</t4693> <t4694>He, however, shared it in even greater silence than hers.</t4694>
<t4695>As soon as Mrs. Dashwood recovered, her first desire was to see Marianne; and within two minutes she was beside her beloved child, whom absence, unhappiness, and danger had made even dearer.</t4695> <t4696>Elinor's pleasure in seeing what each of them felt upon meeting was only restrained by the fear of robbing Marianne of hours of sleep; but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, she could even be prudent when it came to the life of a daughter; and Marianne, content to know that her mother was by her side and aware of being too weak to converse, quickly submitted to the silence and stillness ordered by all who cared for her.</t4696> <t4697>Mrs. Dashwood insisted on watching over her sleep throughout the night, and Elinor, obeying her mother's pleas, went to bed.</t4697> <t4698>But the rest, which a whole night without sleep and so many hours of the most overwhelming anxiety seemed to make so necessary, was hindered by the excitement of her mind.</t4698> <t4699>Willoughby, "poor Willoughby," as she now allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; he could not but have listened.</t4699> <t4700>to his justification before the world, and sometimes she blamed herself, sometimes she absolved herself for having judged him so harshly before.</t4700> <t4701>But her promise to tell her sister about it was invariably painful to her.</t4701> <t4702>She feared doing so, feared the effects it might have on Marianne; she doubted whether, after such an explanation, Marianne could ever be happy with another person; and for a few moments she wished that Willoughby would become a widower; then, remembering Colonel Brandon, she reproached herself, feeling that his sufferings and his constancy, much more than those of his rival, deserved to have Marianne as a reward, and wished for anything to happen except the death of Mrs. Willoughby.</t4702>
<t4703>The commission of Colonel Brandon in Barton had not had too strong an impact on Mrs. Dashwood, because she already harbored strong fears regarding Marianne; she was so worried about her that she had already decided to go to Cleveland that very day, without waiting for further reports, and the preparations for her trip were so advanced before the colonel's arrival that they were expecting the Careys to arrive at any moment to pick up Margaret, whom her mother did not want to take where there was a danger of infection.</t4703>
<t4704>Marianne continued to recover day by day, and the radiant joy on Mrs. Dashwood's face and in her demeanor testified that she was, as she repeatedly confessed, one of the happiest women in the world.</t4704> <t4705>Elinor could not listen to her words, nor observe her expressions, without sometimes wondering if her mother ever remembered Edward.</t4705> <t4706>But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting in the moderate account of her disappointments that Elinor had conveyed to her, allowed the exuberance of her joy to lead her to think only of what could increase it.</t4706> <t4707>Marianne had been returned to her after a danger in which—so she had begun to feel—she herself, with her own erroneous judgment, had contributed to place her, as she had encouraged her unfortunate affection for Willoughby; and in her recovery, she had yet another reason for joy, one which Elinor had not considered.</t4707> <t4708>She made this known to her as soon as the opportunity for a private conversation between them arose.</t4708>
<t4709>—At last, we are alone.</t4709> <t4710>My dear Elinor, you still do not know all of my happiness.</t4710> <t4711>Colonel Brandon loves Marianne; he himself has told me so.</t4711>
<t4712>Elinor, feeling alternately happy and sad, surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.</t4712>
<t4713>—You never react like I do, dear Elinor, or I would be surprised by your composure now.</t4713> <t4714>If I had ever started to think about what would be best for my family, I would have concluded that Colonel Brandon's marriage to one of you was the most desirable.</t4714> <t4715>And I believe that, of the two, Marianne may be the happiest with him.</t4715>
<t4716>Elinor was half-tempted to ask her why she believed that, knowing that she could not give any reason that was based on impartial considerations of age, character, or feelings; but her mother always let her imagination run wild in all matters that interested her, and so, instead of asking, she let it pass with a smile.</t4716>
<t4717>—He completely opened his heart to me yesterday while we were coming here.</t4717> <t4718>It was very sudden, very unpremeditated.</t4718> <t4719>I, as you can imagine, could talk about nothing but my girl; he could not hide his anguish; I saw that it was as great as mine, and he, perhaps thinking that mere friendship, given how things are today, could not justify such a fervent sympathy (or maybe not thinking at all, I suppose), letting himself be overwhelmed by irresistible feelings, revealed to me his deep, tender, and steadfast affection for Marianne.</t4719> <t4720>He has loved her, dear Elinor, since the first time he saw her.</t4720>
<t4721>In this, however, Elinor perceived not the language, not the statements of Colonel Brandon, but the embellishments with which her mother used to enrich everything that delighted her, shaping it to her own tireless imagination.</t4721>
<t4722>—His affection for her, which infinitely surpasses anything Willoughby felt or pretended to feel, much warmer, more sincere, more constant, whatever we may call it, has persisted even with the knowledge of Marianne's unfortunate preference for that despicable young man!</t4722> <t4723>And without selfishness, without nurturing hopes!</t4723> <t4724>How could he see her happy with another?</t4724> <t4725>What nobility of spirit!</t4725> <t4726>What frankness, what sincerity!</t4726> <t4727>With him, no one can be deceived.</t4727>
<t4728>—No one doubts —said Elinor— the reputation of Colonel Brandon as an excellent man.</t4728>
<t4729>—I know it is so —replied her mother with great seriousness—, or after the warning we have had, I would be the last to encourage this affection, or even to take pleasure in it.</t4729> <t4730>But the fact that he went to seek me out as he did, with such diligent, prompt friendship, is enough as proof that he is one of the most estimable men in the world.</t4730>
<t4731>—His reputation, however —replied Elinor— does not rest on a single act of kindness, which his affection for Marianne, if we set aside mere humanitarian spirit, would have driven him to.</t4731> <t4732>Mrs. Jennings, the Middletons, have known him intimately for a long time, and they respect and love him equally; and even I, although only recently, know him well enough, and value and esteem him so much that, if Marianne can be happy with him, I will be as willing as you to think that our relationship with him is the greatest blessing for us.</t4732> <t4733>What did you reply to him? Did you give him any hope?</t4733>
<t4734>—Oh, my love!</t4734> <t4735>There could be no talk of hopes for either him or me.</t4735> <t4736>Marianne could be dying at that moment.</t4736> <t4737>But he did not ask for hopes to be given to him or to be encouraged.</t4737> <t4738>What he did was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible outpouring in front of a friend capable of consoling him, not a request to a mother.</t4738> <t4739>Although after a few moments, because at first I felt quite overwhelmed, I did say that if she lived, as I trusted would happen, it would be my greatest happiness to promote the marriage between them; and since we arrived, with the wonderful certainty that we have had since that moment, I have repeated it to him in various ways, I have encouraged him with all my strength.</t4739> <t4740>Time, I tell him, a little time, will take care of everything; Marianne's heart will not be wasted forever on a man like Willoughby.</t4740> <t4741>His own merits will soon win it.</t4741>
<t4742>—Judging by the colonel's mood, however, he has not managed to infect him with his optimism.</t4742>
<t4743>—No.</t4743> <t4744>He believes that Marianne's love is too deeply rooted to change for a long time; and even assuming that her heart becomes free again, he doesn't have enough confidence in himself to think that, with such a difference in age and manner, he could attract her.</t4744> <t4745>In that, however, he is very mistaken.</t4745> <t4746>He surpasses her in years only to the extent that it constitutes an advantage, giving him firmness of character and principles; and his manner, I am convinced, is exactly what can make your sister happy.</t4746> <t4747>And his appearance, also his manners, all play in his favor.</t4747> <t4748>My sympathy for him does not blind me; of course, he is not as handsome as Willoughby; but, at the same time, there is something much more pleasant in his countenance.</t4748> <t4749>There was always a certain thing, remember, in Willoughby's eyes, there at times, that I didn't like.</t4749>
<t4750>Elinor did not remember it; but her mother, without waiting for her agreement, continued:</t4750>
<t4751>—And his manners, the colonel's manners, not only please me more than Willoughby's ever did, but they are of a style that I am sure attracts Marianne much more.</t4751> <t4752>The gentleness, the genuine concern for others that he shows, his manly and unaffected simplicity, are much more in line with your sister's true nature than the often artificial and untimely vivacity of the other.</t4752> <t4753>I am fully confident that even if Willoughby had turned out to be as kind as he proved to be the opposite, Marianne still would not have been as happy with him as she will be with Colonel Brandon.</t4753>
<t4754>She paused.</t4754> <t4755>Her daughter could not agree with her, but her disagreement was not heard and, therefore, did not cause any offense.</t4755>
<t4756>—In Delaford, she won't be far from me —added Mrs. Dashwood—, even if I remain in Barton; and in all likelihood, since I have learned that it is a large village, there must be some small house or cottage nearby that suits us as well as the current one.</t4756>
<t4757>Poor Elinor!</t4757> <t4758>Here is a new plan to take her to Delaford!</t4758> <t4759>But she was strong in spirit.</t4759>
<t4760>—His fortune, too!</t4760> <t4761>Because at my age, you know that everyone worries about that; and although I neither know nor wish to know how much it amounts to, I am sure it must be considerable.</t4761>
<t4762>At that moment, the entrance of a third party interrupted them, and Elinor withdrew to meditate on all these things alone, to wish her friend success and, even while wishing it, to feel a sharp pain for Willoughby.</t4762>
<t4763>CHAPTER XLVI</t4763>
<t4764>Marianne's illness, though very debilitating by nature, had not been so long as to delay her recovery; and her youth, natural energy, and the presence of her mother facilitated it in such a way that, just four days after Mrs. Dashwood arrived, she was able to move to Mrs. Palmer's sitting room.</t4764> <t4765>Once there, she herself requested that Colonel Brandon be sent for, as she was eager to thank him for bringing her mother.</t4765>
<t4766>The colonel's reaction upon entering the room, seeing how much Marianne's appearance had changed, and receiving the pale hand she immediately extended to him, made Elinor think that the immense emotion he displayed must stem from something more than his affection for her or knowing that others were aware of his feelings; and she soon discovered in his sadness and the way his color had changed upon looking at her sister, the probable reproduction in his memory of countless scenes of anguish lived in the past, relived by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza that he had already spoken of, now reinforced by the sunken eyes, lifeless skin, her appearance of prostrate weakness, and the warm acknowledgment of a special debt to him.</t4766>
<t4767>For Mrs. Dashwood, no less attentive than her daughter to what was happening but with ideas that went in very different directions and, therefore, expecting very different effects, the colonel's behavior originated from the simplest and most obvious sensations, while in Marianne's words and gestures she wanted to see the birth of something more than mere gratitude.</t4767>
<t4768>After one or two days, with Marianne visibly regaining strength every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, driven by her own desires as well as those of her daughter, began to talk about returning to Barton.</t4768> <t4769>The measures she took would determine those of her two friends: Mrs. Jennings could not leave Cleveland while the Dashwoods were there, and Colonel Brandon, obeying the unanimous request of all of them, had to consider his stay as subject to the same terms, if not equally indispensable.</t4769> <t4770>In turn, in response to the joint request of Mrs. Jennings and the Colonel, Mrs. Dashwood had to accept the latter's carriage for their return trip, for the comfort of her sick daughter; and the Colonel, in the face of the invitation from Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose diligent good nature made her friendly and hospitable on behalf of others as well as herself, gladly committed to retrieving it by making a visit to the Barton cottage in the course of a few weeks.</t4770>
<t4771>The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after a long and very special farewell to Mrs. Jennings, so full of gratitude, so full of respect and good wishes as she secretly and intimately acknowledged she owed her for her past slights, and saying goodbye to Colonel Brandon with the cordiality of a friend, got into the carriage helped by him, who seemed determined that she should occupy at least half of the space.</t4771> <t4772>Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor followed next, leaving those who remained there to talk about the travelers and feel the despondency that overwhelmed them, until Mrs. Jennings was called to her own carriage, where she found solace in her maid's comments about the loss of her two young companions; and immediately after, Colonel Brandon embarked on his solitary journey to Delaford.</t4772>
<t4773>For two days the Dashwoods were on the road, and Marianne endured the journey on both without true fatigue.</t4773> <t4774>Everything that the most diligent affection and the most solicitous care could do for her comfort was tirelessly done by each of her two companions; and both were rewarded by the physical rest she achieved and the tranquility of her spirit.</t4774> <t4775>This latter was especially gratifying for Elinor.</t4775> <t4776>After watching Marianne week after week in constant suffering, seeing her heart oppressed by an anguish she neither had the courage to express nor the strength to conceal, she now observed in her, with a joy that no one else could feel in the same way, an apparent serenity that if it was—as she hoped it was—the result of reflection, could in time bring her contentment and joy.</t4776>
<t4777>As they approached Barton, however, and passed by places where each field and tree brought back some particularly painful memory, Marianne became silent and pensive; and turning her face so she wouldn't be seen, she kept staring out the window.</t4777> <t4778>But Elinor could neither be surprised nor blame her for it; and when, upon helping her down from the carriage, she saw that she had been crying, she considered it an emotion too natural in itself to elicit any response less tender than pity and, given the discretion with which it had been expressed, deserving of all praise.</t4778> <t4779>In all her subsequent behavior, she saw the traces of a mind determined to make a reasonable effort, for as soon as they entered their sitting room, Marianne surveyed it with a determined and firm look, as if resolved to immediately get accustomed to the sight of every object that could be associated with the memory of Willoughby.</t4779> <t4780>She spoke little, but each of her phrases pointed to cheerfulness; and although an occasional sigh escaped her, she never let it pass without compensating it with a smile.</t4780> <t4781>After dinner, she tried to play the piano.</t4781> <t4782>She approached it, but the piece that first caught her eye was an opera, a gift from Willoughby to her, which contained some of their favorite duets and on whose first page he had written her name in his own handwriting.</t4782> <t4783>That was not going to work.</t4783> <t4784>She shook her head, set the sheet music aside, and after letting her fingers run over the keys for a minute, complained that they were weak and closed the instrument again; along with that, however, she firmly declared that she must practice a lot in the future.</t4784>
<t4785>The next morning did not bring any reduction in these happy symptoms.</t4785> <t4786>On the contrary, strengthened in mind and body by rest, her gestures and words seemed genuinely animated as she anticipated the pleasure of Margaret's return and commented on how the beloved family group would be restored with it, and how their shared activities and cheerful company were the only happiness one could wish for.</t4786>
<t4787>—When the weather stabilizes and you have regained your strength —she said—, we will take long walks together every day.</t4787> <t4788>We will go to the farm by the hill and see how the children are doing; we will walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross and near the abbey; we will often go to the old convent ruins and try to explore their foundations as far as we were told they once reached.</t4788> <t4789>I know we will be happy.</t4789> <t4790>I know the summer will pass joyfully.</t4790> <t4791>I intend never to get up after six, and from that hour until dinner, I will divide each moment between music and reading.</t4791> <t4792>I have made a plan and I am determined to continue my studies seriously.</t4792> <t4793>I know our library too well to turn to it for anything more than simple entertainment.</t4793> <t4794>But there are many works worth reading at Barton Park, and more modern ones that I know I can borrow from Colonel Brandon.</t4794> <t4795>By reading just six hours a day, in a year I will have achieved a level of education that I now know I lack.</t4795>
<t4796>Elinor praised her for a plan born of such a noble motive, though she smiled at seeing the same anxious imagination that had led her to the greatest extremes of languid indolence and selfish complaints, now engaged in introducing excesses into a plan of such rational activities and virtuous self-control.</t4796> <t4797>Her smile, however, turned into a sigh when she remembered that she had not yet fulfilled the promise made to Willoughby, and feared having to communicate something that might once again disturb Marianne's mind and destroy, at least for a time, this pleasant prospect of industrious tranquility.</t4797> <t4798>Eager, then, to postpone that fateful hour, she resolved to wait until her sister's health was more stable to tell her.</t4798> <t4799>But the only fate of such a decision was not to be fulfilled.</t4799>
<t4800>Marianne had been at home for two or three days before the weather improved enough for a convalescent like her to venture outside.</t4800> <t4801>But finally, a mild and warm morning dawned, capable of encouraging the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, supported by Elinor's arm, was authorized to walk in the meadow in front of the house as much as she wanted, as long as she didn't get tired.</t4801>
<t4802>The sisters set out with the slow pace that Marianne's weakness required in an exercise not attempted until that moment; and they had barely moved far enough from the house to have a full view of the hill, the large hill behind the house, when stopping with her gaze turned towards it, Marianne said quite calmly:</t4802>
<t4803>—There, exactly there —pointing with one hand—, on that mound, that's where I fell; and that's where I saw Willoughby for the first time.</t4803>
<t4804>His voice faded when he pronounced that word, but recovering immediately, he added:</t4804>
<t4805>—How grateful I am to discover that I can look at that place with so little pain!</t4805> <t4806>Will we ever talk about that subject, Elinor? —he said with a trembling voice—.</t4806> <t4807>Or will it not be good?</t4807> <t4808>I can talk about it now, I hope, and in the way I should.</t4808>
<t4809>Elinor invited her with great tenderness to unburden herself.</t4809>
<t4810>—As for lamenting —said Marianne—, I am done with that, as far as he is concerned.</t4810> <t4811>I do not intend to speak to you about what my feelings towards him have been, but about what they are now.</t4811> <t4812>Currently, if I could be certain about one thing, if I could think that he was not always playing a role, not always deceiving me...; but, above all, if someone could assure me that he was never as wicked as my fears have sometimes portrayed him, since I learned the story of that unfortunate girl...</t4812>
<t4813>He stopped.</t4813> <t4814>Elinor received his words with joy, treasuring them, while she responded:</t4814>
<t4815>—If you could be given assurance about that, do you think you would achieve peace?</t4815>
<t4816>—Yes.</t4816> <t4817>My peace of mind doubly depends on it; for not only is it terrible to suspect such intentions from someone who has been what he was to me, but also, how does it make me appear?</t4817> <t4818>In a situation like mine, what else but the most shamefully indiscreet affection could have exposed me to...?</t4818>
<t4819>—So, how do you explain his behavior?</t4819>
<t4820>—I would like to think... oh, how I would like to be able to think that it was just fickleness... very, very fickle!</t4820>
<t4821>Elinor said no more.</t4821> <t4822>She deliberated internally about whether to begin her story immediately or to postpone it until Marianne was stronger, and they continued walking slowly for a few minutes without speaking.</t4822>
<t4823>—I am not wishing him a great good —said Marianne finally with a deep sigh— when I wish that his innermost thoughts are no more ungrateful than mine.</t4823> <t4824>With that alone, he will suffer enough.</t4824>
<t4825>—Are you comparing your behavior to theirs?</t4825>
<t4826>—No.</t4826> <t4827>I compare it to what it should have been; I compare it to yours.</t4827>
<t4828>—Your situation and mine have not been very similar.</t4828>
<t4829>—They have resembled each other more than our behaviors ever did.</t4829> <t4830>Do not let, dearest Elinor, your kindness defend what I know your judgment must condemn.</t4830> <t4831>My illness has made me think, it has given me quiet time and calm to seriously meditate on things.</t4831> <t4832>Long before I had recovered enough to speak, I could perfectly well reflect.</t4832> <t4833>I weighed the past: all I saw in my own behavior, from the beginning of our relationship with him last autumn, was a series of imprudences against myself and a lack of kindness towards others.</t4833> <t4834>I saw that my own feelings had paved the way for my sufferings and that my lack of strength in pain had almost brought me to the grave.</t4834> <t4835>I was aware that I myself had been the cause of my illness by neglecting my own health in a way that even at that time I felt was wrong.</t4835> <t4836>If I had died, it would have been self-destruction.</t4836> <t4837>I did not know the danger I had put myself in until that danger had passed; but with feelings like those to which these reflections gave rise, I am surprised I recovered; I am astonished that the very intensity of my desire to live, to have time for atonement before my God and before all of you, did not kill me immediately.</t4837> <t4838>If I had died, in what singular anguish would I have left you, my caregiver, my friend, my sister!</t4838> <t4839>You, who had seen all the irritable selfishness of my last days; who had known all the secrets of my heart!</t4839> <t4840>How would I have lingered in your memories!</t4840> <t4841>And my mother, too!</t4841> <t4842>How could you have consoled her!</t4842> <t4843>I cannot put into words how much I hated myself.</t4843> <t4844>Every time I looked back at the past, I saw a duty I had neglected or some fault I had overlooked.</t4844> <t4845>It seemed I had caused harm to everyone.</t4845> <t4846>To Mrs. Jennings' kindness, to her uninterrupted kindness, I had responded with ungrateful disdain.</t4846> <t4847>With the Middletons, with the Palmers, with the Steeles, even with the most ordinary acquaintances, I had been insolent and unjust; my heart had remained insensitive to their merits and my temper irritated by their very attentions.</t4847> <t4848>To John, to Fanny (yes, even to them, though they deserve little), I had given less than what was due to them.</t4848> <t4849>But to you, to you above all, above my mother, I had offended.</t4849> <t4850>I, only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; and yet, how did it influence me?</t4850> <t4851>Not in making me more compassionate, benefiting either you or myself.</t4851> <t4852>I had your example before me; but, what good did it do me?</t4852> <t4853>Was I more considerate of you and your well-being?</t4853> <t4854>Did I imitate the way you restrained yourself or ease your burdens by taking on some of the general deference or personal gratitude that had until then fallen entirely on you?</t4854> <t4855>No; when I knew you were unhappy no less than when I believed you to be at peace, I left unfulfilled all that duty or friendship demanded of me; I barely admitted that pain existed except in myself, and I only wept for that heart that had abandoned and wronged me, letting you, whom I professed to love without limits, suffer because of me.</t4855>
<t4856>At this point, the rapid flow of recriminations she directed at herself came to a halt; and Elinor, eager to provide relief, though too honest to flatter, immediately offered her the praise and support that her frankness and repentance so well deserved.</t4856> <t4857>Marianne squeezed her hand and replied:</t4857>
<t4858>—You are very good.</t4858> <t4859>The future must be my test.</t4859> <t4860>I have made a plan, and if I am able to follow it, I will master my feelings and improve my temperament.</t4860> <t4861>They will no longer mean worries for others nor torments for myself.</t4861> <t4862>From now on, I will live solely for my family.</t4862> <t4863>You, my mother, Margaret, from now on will be my entire world; all my affection will be divided among you.</t4863> <t4864>There will never again be anything that incites me to leave you or the home; and if I associate with other people, it will only be to show a more humble spirit, a mended heart, and to demonstrate that I can carry out the courtesies, the smallest obligations of life, with gentleness and patience.</t4864> <t4865>As for Willoughby, it would be idle to say that I will soon or ever forget him.</t4865> <t4866>No change of circumstances or opinions will be able to overcome his memory.</t4866> <t4867>But it will be subject to the rules and restraints of religion, reason, and constant occupation.</t4867>
<t4868>He paused, and added in a lower voice:</t4868>
<t4869>—If only I could know his heart, everything would be easier.</t4869>
<t4870>Elinor, who had been deliberating for some time about the convenience or inconvenience of venturing to tell her story immediately, listened to this without feeling any more decided than at the beginning; and noticing that, as the deliberation led nowhere, the determination had to take charge of everything, she soon found herself facing it.</t4870>
<t4871>He conducted the narrative, as he expected, with skill; he carefully prepared his anxious listener; he recounted the main points on which Willoughby based his defense with simplicity and honesty; he duly appreciated his repentance and only tempered his statements regarding his current love for Marianne.</t4871> <t4872>She did not utter a word; she trembled, her eyes fixed on the ground and her lips whiter than the illness had left them.</t4872> <t4873>A thousand questions sprang from her heart, but she did not dare to ask any.</t4873> <t4874>She listened to every word with eager anxiety; her hand, without her realizing it, tightly clasped her sister's, and tears covered her cheeks.</t4874>
<t4875>Elinor, fearing that she might have been fatigued, led her home; and until they reached the door, easily guessing what her curiosity would be directed towards although at no time could she express it in questions, she spoke to her of nothing but Willoughby and what they had talked about; and she was carefully meticulous in all the details of what he had said and his appearance, wherever she could safely afford a detailed description.</t4875> <t4876>As soon as they entered the house, Marianne kissed her with gratitude and barely articulating through her tears three words, "Tell it to mama," she parted from her sister and slowly went up the stairs.</t4876> <t4877>Elinor for no reason was going to disturb such an understandable search for solitude as that; and thinking with great anxiety about its possible results, while at the same time deciding not to bring up the subject again if Marianne did not, she went to the sitting room to fulfill her last command.</t4877>
<t4878>CHAPTER XLVII</t4878>
<t4879>Mrs. Dashwood could not help but be moved upon hearing the vindication of her former favorite.</t4879> <t4880>She was glad to see him absolved of some of the faults that were attributed to him; she felt sorry for him; she wished him to be happy.</t4880> <t4881>But the feelings of the past could not be revived.</t4881> <t4882>Nothing could restore him with his word intact and an unblemished character before Marianne.</t4882> <t4883>Nothing could erase the knowledge of what she had suffered because of him, nor eliminate the guilt of his behavior with Eliza.</t4883> <t4884>Nothing could then return him to the place he had occupied in Mrs. Dashwood's affection, nor harm Colonel Brandon's interests.</t4884>
<t4885>If, like her daughter, Mrs. Dashwood had heard Willoughby's story from his own lips; if she had witnessed his anguish and experienced the influence of his countenance and demeanor, it is likely that her compassion would have been greater.</t4885> <t4886>But it was not in Elinor's hands nor did she wish to awaken such feelings in others with a detailed explanation, as had happened initially with her.</t4886> <t4887>Reflection had brought tranquility to her judgments and moderated her opinion on what Willoughby deserved; she therefore wished to say only the simplest truth and present those facts that could truly be attributed to his character without embellishing them with any touch of affection that might awaken the imagination and lead it down erroneous paths.</t4887>
<t4888>At dusk, when they were all together, Marianne began to speak of him voluntarily again, but not without an effort that became evident in the agitated, restless introspection in which she had been immersed for some time before, in the blush that rose to her face as she spoke, in her faltering voice.</t4888>
<t4889>—I wish to assure both of you —he said— that I see everything... as you may wish me to.</t4889>
<t4890>Mrs. Dashwood would have immediately interrupted her with consoling tenderness, if Elinor, who genuinely wished to hear her sister's impartial opinion, had not demanded silence with an impatient gesture.</t4890> <t4891>Marianne continued slowly:</t4891>
<t4892>—It is a great relief to me what Elinor told me this morning: I have heard exactly what I wanted to hear —for a few moments her voice faltered; but, recovering, she continued speaking, and more calmly than before—:</t4892> <t4893>With that, I am completely satisfied.</t4893> <t4894>I do not wish for anything to change.</t4894> <t4895>I could never have been happy with him after knowing all this, as sooner or later I would have found out.</t4895> <t4896>I would have lost all trust, all esteem for him.</t4896> <t4897>Nothing could have prevented me from feeling that way.</t4897>
<t4898>—I know, I know! —exclaimed her mother—.</t4898> <t4899>Happy with a man of libertine conduct!</t4899> <t4900>With one who had thus broken the peace of the dearest of our friends and the best of men?</t4900> <t4901>No, a man like that could never have made my Marianne's heart happy!</t4901> <t4902>In her conscience, in her sensitive conscience, would have weighed everything that should have weighed on her husband's.</t4902>
<t4903>Marianne sighed, repeating:</t4903>
<t4904>—I don't want anything to change.</t4904>
<t4905>—You judge all this —said Elinor— exactly as it should be judged by a person of capable mind and sound understanding; and I dare say that you find (as I do, and not only in this but in many other circumstances) sufficient reasons to convince yourself that marriage with Willoughby would have brought you many anxieties and disappointments in which you would have found little support from an affection that, on his part, would have been very uncertain.</t4905> <t4906>If they had married, they would have always been poor.</t4906> <t4907>Even he himself acknowledges being immoderate in his expenses, and all his conduct indicates that depriving himself of something is a phrase absent from his vocabulary.</t4907> <t4908>Their demands and your inexperience together, with a very, very small income, would have put you in troubles that, not being completely unknown to you before, or never having thought of them, would be no less painful.</t4908> <t4909>I know that your sense of honor and honesty would have led you, upon realizing the situation, to attempt all the savings that seemed possible to you; and perhaps, while your frugality only diminished your well-being, you could have endured it, but beyond that (and, what could the greatest of your isolated efforts have done to stop a ruin that had begun before your marriage?), beyond that, if you had tried, even in the most reasonable way, to limit his amusements, would it not have been feared that instead of inducing someone with such selfish feelings to consent to it, you would have ended up weakening your influence in his heart and making him regret the union that had brought him such difficulties?</t4909>
<t4910>Marianne's lips trembled and she repeated "selfish?" with a tone that implied "do you really think he's selfish?"</t4910>
<t4911>—All his behavior —replied Elinor—, from the beginning to the end of this story, has been based on selfishness.</t4911> <t4912>It was selfishness that first made him play with your feelings and that later, when his own were compromised, led him to delay his confession and that finally drove him away from Barton.</t4912> <t4913>His own pleasure or his own peace of mind were always the principles that guided his conduct.</t4913>
<t4914>—It's very true.</t4914> <t4915>My happiness was never their goal.</t4915>
<t4916>—At present —continued Elinor—, he regrets what he did.</t4916> <t4917>And, why does he regret it?</t4917> <t4918>Because he has discovered that it did not serve him.</t4918> <t4919>It has not made him happy.</t4919> <t4920>He no longer has financial problems, he does not suffer in that aspect, and he only thinks that he married a woman with a less kind temperament than yours.</t4920> <t4921>But, does it follow from that that if he had married you he would be happy?</t4921> <t4922>The difficulties would have been different.</t4922> <t4923>He would have suffered from the financial worries that, now that he does not have them, have lost importance for him.</t4923> <t4924>He would have had a wife whose character he could not have complained about, but he would have always lived in need, always poor; and probably very soon he would have learned to value much more the countless comforts that a debt-free estate and a good income provide, even for domestic happiness, than the simple character of a wife.</t4924>
<t4925>—I have no doubt about it —said Marianne—; and I regret nothing... nothing except my own foolishness.</t4925>
<t4926>—Say rather your mother's imprudence, dear —said Mrs. Dashwood—; she is the one responsible.</t4926>
<t4927>Marianne did not let her continue; and Elinor, satisfied to see that each recognized her own mistake, wished to avoid any examination of the past that might weaken her sister's spirit; thus, returning to the first topic, she immediately continued:</t4927>
<t4928>—From this entire story, I believe there is one conclusion that can be justly drawn: that all of Willoughby's problems arose from the first offense against morality, his behavior with Eliza Williams.</t4928> <t4929>That crime was the origin of all the lesser evils that followed and of all his current discontent.</t4929>
<t4930>Marianne wholeheartedly agreed with that observation; and her mother responded to it with a list of the wrongs inflicted upon Colonel Brandon and his merits, in which there was all the enthusiasm that could arise from the fusion of friendship and interest.</t4930> <t4931>Her daughter, however, did not seem to have paid much attention to her.</t4931>
<t4932>Just as she had expected, Elinor saw that in the two or three days following, Marianne did not continue to regain her strength as she had been doing; but as long as her determination remained unwavering and she continued to strive to appear cheerful and calm, her sister could confidently trust that time would eventually heal her.</t4932>
<t4933>Margaret returned and the whole family gathered again; once more they settled peacefully in the country cottage, and although they did not continue their usual studies with the same energy they had put into them when they first arrived at Barton, they at least planned to vigorously resume them in the future.</t4933>
<t4934>Elinor began to grow impatient for some news of Edward.</t4934> <t4935>She had heard nothing of him since his departure from London, nothing new about his plans, not even anything certain about his current place of residence.</t4935> <t4936>Some letters had been exchanged with her brother due to Marianne's illness, and in the first of John's letters came this phrase: "We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward and can find out nothing on such a forbidden subject, but we believe him still to be in Oxford."</t4936> <t4937>That was all the information about Edward that the correspondence provided her, for in none of the subsequent letters was his name mentioned.</t4937> <t4938>She was not, however, condemned to remain too long in ignorance of his plans.</t4938>
<t4939>One morning they had sent their servant to Exeter with an errand; and upon his return, while serving at the table, he answered his mistress's questions about the results of his task.</t4939> <t4940>Among his reports, he voluntarily offered the following:</t4940>
<t4941>—I suppose you know, madam, that Mr. Ferrars has gotten married.</t4941>
<t4942>Marianne had a violent start, fixed her gaze on Elinor, saw her turn pale, and collapsed into the chair in a fit of hysteria.</t4942> <t4943>Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes had intuitively followed the same direction while answering the question.</t4943> <t4944>of the servant, felt a strong impact upon noticing from Elinor's countenance the magnitude of her pain; and a moment later, equally distressed by Marianne's condition, she did not know to which of her daughters to attend first.</t4944>
<t4945>Noticing only that Miss Marianne seemed ill, the servant was sensible enough to call one of the maids, who led her to another room with the help of Mrs. Dashwood.</t4945> <t4946>By that time Marianne was already better, and her mother, leaving her in the care of Margaret and the maid, returned to Elinor, who, although still very upset, had regained enough reason and voice to start questioning Thomas about the source of his information.</t4946> <t4947>Mrs. Dashwood immediately took over that task, and Elinor was able to benefit from the information without the effort of having to seek it herself.</t4947>
<t4948>—Who told you that Mr. Ferrars had gotten married, Thomas?</t4948>
<t4949>—With my own eyes I saw Mr. Ferrars, madam, this morning in Exeter, and also his wife, who was Miss Steele.</t4949> <t4950>They were standing there in front of the New London inn in their carriage, when I went with a message from Sally, the one from the estate, to her brother, who is one of the postilions.</t4950> <t4951>Just as I looked up when passing by the carriage, I saw clearly that it was the younger Miss Steele; so I took off my hat and she recognized me and called me over, and asked about you, madam, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, and she asked me to send her regards and Mr. Ferrars' as well, their highest regards and attentions, and to tell you how sorry they were not to have time to come visit, but they were in a hurry to continue as they still had a long way to go, but they assured me that on their way back they would make sure to stop by to see you.</t4951>
<t4952>—But did she tell you that she had gotten married, Thomas?</t4952>
<t4953>—Yes, ma'am.</t4953> <t4954>She smiled and said that she had changed her name since the last time she had been around these parts.</t4954> <t4955>She was always a very friendly young woman, easy to get along with, and very well-mannered.</t4955> <t4956>So I took the liberty of wishing her happiness.</t4956>
<t4957>—And was Mr. Ferrars with her in the carriage?</t4957>
<t4958>—Yes, ma'am, I just saw him sitting there, leaning back, but he didn't look up.</t4958> <t4959>The gentleman was never very inclined to converse.</t4959>
<t4960>Elinor's heart could easily explain why the gentleman had not appeared; and Mrs. Dashwood probably imagined the same reason.</t4960>
<t4961>—Was there no one else in the carriage?</t4961>
<t4962>—No, ma'am, just the two of them.</t4962>
<t4963>—Do you know where they were coming from?</t4963>
<t4964>—They were coming straight from the city, according to what Miss Lucy... Mrs. Ferrars told me.</t4964>
<t4965>—But were they going further west?</t4965>
<t4966>—Yes, ma'am, but not to stay long.</t4966> <t4967>They will come back later and then they will surely pass by here.</t4967>
<t4968>Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter, but Elinor knew well that she should not expect them.</t4968> <t4969>She recognized Lucy entirely in the message, and was certain that Edward would never come to their house.</t4969> <t4970>In a low voice, she remarked to her mother that they were probably going to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.</t4970>
<t4971>Thomas seemed to have finished his reports.</t4971> <t4972>Elinor seemed to want to know more.</t4972>
<t4973>—Did you see them leave before you left?</t4973>
<t4974>—No, ma'am; they were already bringing out the horses, but I couldn't stay any longer; I was afraid of being late.</t4974> <t4975>—Did Mrs. Ferrars seem to be well?</t4975>
<t4976>—Yes, ma'am, she said she was very well; in my view, she was always a very pretty young woman and seemed enormously happy.</t4976>
<t4977>Mrs. Dashwood could think of nothing more to ask, and Thomas and the tablecloth, now equally unnecessary, were soon taken away.</t4977> <t4978>Marianne had already sent word that she would not eat anything more; Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor had also lost their appetite, and Margaret could feel quite well about the fact that, despite the countless anxieties both sisters had experienced recently, despite the many reasons they had had to neglect meals, they had never before had to go without dinner.</t4978>
<t4979>When they were brought dessert and wine and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left alone, they remained together for a long time in similar meditations and identical silence.</t4979> <t4980>Mrs. Dashwood did not venture to make any observations and did not dare to offer consolation.</t4980> <t4981>She now realized that she had been mistaken in trusting the image that Elinor had been presenting of herself; and correctly concluded that Elinor had downplayed everything that was happening to her at the time only to spare her greater suffering, considering how much she was already suffering for Marianne.</t4981> <t4982>She realized that her daughter's careful, considerate solicitude had led her to the error of thinking that the affection she had once understood so well was actually much less serious than she used to believe or than it now appeared to be.</t4982> <t4983>She feared that, by allowing herself to be convinced in this way, she had been unjust, inconsiderate... no, almost cruel to Elinor; that Marianne's affliction, being more evident, more apparent to her eyes, had absorbed too much of her tenderness, leading her to almost forget that in Elinor she might have another daughter suffering as much as she was, with a pain that had certainly been less sought and that she had endured with much greater fortitude.</t4983>
<t4984>CHAPTER XLVIII</t4984>
<t4985>Elinor had discovered the difference between expecting an unpleasant event to occur, no matter how certain it might seem, and the certainty itself.</t4985> <t4986>She had discovered that, while Edward remained single, despite herself she had always given room to the hope that something would happen to prevent his marriage to Lucy; that something—a decision he would make, some intervention from friends, or a better opportunity for the lady to establish herself—would arise to allow the happiness of all of them.</t4986> <t4987>But now he was married, and she blamed her own heart for that hidden tendency to form illusions which made the news so much more painful.</t4987>
<t4988>At first, he was surprised that he had gotten married so soon, before (as he imagined) his ordination and, consequently, before having taken possession of the benefice.</t4988> <t4989>But it didn't take long for him to see how likely it was that Lucy, safeguarding her own interests and eager to secure him as soon as possible, would overlook anything except the risk of delay.</t4989> <t4990>They had gotten married, they had done it in the city, and now they were heading quickly to her uncle's place.</t4990> <t4991>What must Edward have felt being four miles from Barton, seeing his mother's servant, hearing Lucy's message!</t4991>
<t4992>He supposed that they would soon have settled in Delaford...</t4992> <t4993>Delaford, where so many things conspired to interest her, the place she wanted to know and also avoid.</t4993> <t4994>She had a quick image of them in the parsonage; she saw Lucy as the active administrator, managing to balance her aspirations for elegance with the utmost frugality, and embarrassed that even half of her economic maneuvers might be suspected; always with her own interest in mind, securing the goodwill of Colonel Brandon, Mrs. Jennings, and each of her wealthy friends.</t4994> <t4995>She did not quite know how she saw Edward or how she wished to see him: happy or unhappy...: neither possibility pleased her; she then pushed any image of him out of her mind.</t4995>
<t4996>Elinor was under the illusion that some of their acquaintances in London would write to them announcing the event and giving them more details; but days went by without bringing letters or news.</t4996> <t4997>Although she was not sure that anyone could be blamed for it, she somehow criticized each of the absent friends.</t4997> <t4998>They were all inconsiderate or indolent.</t4998>
<t4999>—When will you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am? —was the question that sprang from her impatience for something to be done about it.</t4999>
<t5000>—I wrote to him last week, my love, and I rather hope to see him arrive instead of hearing news from him.</t5000> <t5001>I insisted that he come visit us, and I wouldn't be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day.</t5001>
<t5002>This was already something, something to pin their hopes on.</t5002> <t5003>Colonel Brandon must have some information to give them.</t5003>
<t5004>No sooner had he finished such a thing, when the figure of a man on horseback caught his eye through the window.</t5004> <t5005>He stopped in front of the gate.</t5005> <t5006>It was a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself.</t5006> <t5007>Now he would know more; and he trembled at the thought.</t5007> <t5008>But it was not Colonel Brandon... he had neither his bearing nor his height.</t5008> <t5009>If it were possible, he would say it must be Edward.</t5009> <t5010>He looked again.</t5010> <t5011>He had just dismounted... he could not be mistaken... it was Edward.</t5011> <t5012>He walked away and sat down.</t5012> <t5013>“He comes from Mr. Pratt's place specifically to see us.</t5013> <t5014>I must remain calm; I must conduct myself with composure.”</t5014>
<t5015>In a moment, she realized that the others had also noticed the mistake.</t5015> <t5016>She saw that her mother and Marianne changed color; she saw them looking at her and whispering something to each other.</t5016> <t5017>She would have given anything to be able to speak and make them understand that she hoped there would be no coldness or disdain towards him in their treatment.</t5017> <t5018>But she couldn't find her voice and was forced to leave everything to the discretion of her mother and sister.</t5018>
<t5019>They did not exchange a single word between them.</t5019> <t5020>They waited in silence for their visitor to appear.</t5020> <t5021>They listened to his footsteps along the gravel path; one moment he was in the corridor, and the next he was in front of them.</t5021>
<t5022>Upon entering the room, his countenance did not show great happiness, not even from Elinor's perspective.</t5022> <t5023>His face was pale with agitation, and he seemed fearful of how he would be received and aware that he did not deserve a kind welcome.</t5023> <t5024>Mrs. Dashwood, however, trusting that in doing so she would fulfill the wishes of that daughter by whom she intended to be guided in everything from the depths of her heart, received him with a look of forced joy, shook his hand, and wished him happiness.</t5024>
<t5025>Edward blushed and stammered an unintelligible response.</t5025> <t5026>Elinor's lips had moved in sync with her mother's, and when the activity was over, she wished she had also shaken hands.</t5026> <t5027>But it was already too late, and with an expression on her face that was meant to be plain, she sat back down and talked about the weather.</t5027>
<t5028>Marianne, trying to hide her distress, had withdrawn as much out of sight of the others as she could; and Margaret, partly understanding what was happening but not completely, thought it was her duty to behave with dignity, took a seat as far from Edward as she could and maintained a strict silence.</t5028>
<t5029>When Elinor finished expressing her happiness about the dry weather of the season, a horrible pause ensued.</t5029> <t5030>It was broken by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to wish that he had left Mrs. Ferrars in very good health.</t5030> <t5031>He hastily replied that she was.</t5031>
<t5032>Another pause.</t5032>
<t5033>Elinor, deciding to make an effort, although fearful of the sound of her own voice, said:</t5033>
<t5034>—Is Mrs. Ferrars in Longstaple?</t5034>
<t5035>—In Longstaple! —he replied, with a surprised air—.</t5035> <t5036>No, my mother is in the city.</t5036>
<t5037>—I was referring —said Elinor, picking up one of the pieces of work from the table— to Mrs. Edward Ferrars.</t5037>
<t5038>He did not dare to raise his eyes; but his mother and Marianne directed their gaze at him.</t5038> <t5039>Edward blushed, seemed to feel perplexed, looked at her with a doubtful air and, after some hesitation, said:</t5039>
<t5040>—Perhaps he means... my brother... means Mrs. Robert Ferrars.</t5040>
<t5041>—Mrs. Robert Ferrars! —repeated Marianne and her mother in a tone of enormous astonishment; and although Elinor was unable to speak, she also fixed her eyes on him with the same impatient bewilderment.</t5041> <t5042>He got up from his seat and went to the window, apparently not knowing what to do; he took a pair of scissors that were lying around, and while cutting into pieces the case in which they were kept, thus ruining both things, he said in a hurried tone:</t5042>
<t5043>—Perhaps you do not know, you may not have known that my brother has recently married... the younger... Miss Lucy Steele.</t5043>
<t5044>Her words were repeated with indescribable astonishment by everyone, except Elinor, who remained seated with her head bent over her work, in such a state of agitation that she barely knew where she was.</t5044>
<t5045>—Yes —he said—, they got married last week and now they are in Dawlish.</t5045>
<t5046>Elinor could not remain seated.</t5046> <t5047>She left the room almost running, and as soon as she closed the door, she burst into tears of joy that at first she thought would never end.</t5047> <t5048>Edward, who until that moment had been looking anywhere but at her, saw her rush out and perhaps saw—or even heard—her emotion, for immediately afterward he fell into a dreamlike state that no affectionate remark or question from Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate; finally, without saying a word, he left the room and headed toward the village, leaving them astonished and perplexed at such a marvelous and sudden change in circumstances, given over to a bewilderment that they could only alleviate through conjectures.</t5048>
<t5049>CHAPTER XLIX</t5049>
<t5050>As inexplicable as the circumstances of his release seemed to the whole family, the truth was that Edward was free; and it was easy for everyone to predict how he would use that freedom: after experiencing the benefits of an imprudent engagement, entered into without his mother's consent, as he had already done for more than four years, with that one failing, nothing less could be expected of him than to see him entering into another.</t5050>
<t5051>The task he had to accomplish in Barton was, in fact, quite simple.</t5051> <t5052>It was merely a matter of asking Elinor to marry him; and considering that he was not entirely inexperienced in such endeavors, it might be surprising that he felt as uncomfortable on this occasion as he truly did, so in need of encouragement and fresh air.</t5052>
<t5053>It is not necessary, however, to detail how long his walk took to lead him to make the right decision, how long it took for the opportunity to put it into practice to present itself, how it was expressed, and how it was received.</t5053> <t5054>The only thing that matters to say is this: that when everyone sat down at the table at four, about three hours after his arrival, he had won his lady, had obtained the mother's consent, and was the happiest of men.</t5054> <t5055>And this not only in the enamored lover's rapturous speech but in the reality of reason and truth.</t5055> <t5056>Indeed, his happiness was more than common.</t5056> <t5057>A greater triumph than usual in requited love filled his heart and elevated his spirit.</t5057> <t5058>He had freed himself, without any fault on his part, from bonds that had long made him unhappy and had kept him tied to a woman he had long ceased to love; and, immediately, he had found in another woman that security for which he must have despaired from the very moment he began to desire her.</t5058> <t5059>He had transitioned not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness; and he spoke of the change openly with a joy so genuine, easy, and comforting as his friends had never known him to have before.</t5059>
<t5060>He had opened his heart to Elinor, confessed all his weaknesses, and discussed his first and childish infatuation with Lucy with all the philosophical dignity of twenty-four years.</t5060>
<t5061>—It was a foolish and idle attachment on my part —he said—, a consequence of my ignorance of the world... and lack of occupation.</t5061> <t5062>If my mother had given me some active profession when I was taken out of Mr. Pratt's tutelage at eighteen, I believe... no, I am sure that nothing would have ever happened, for although I left Longstaple with what I then believed to be the most invincible devotion for her niece, even so, if I had had any activity, anything to occupy my time and keep me away from her for a few months, I would soon have overcome those fanciful affections, especially if I had interacted more with other people, as I would have had to do in that case.</t5062> <t5063>But instead of employing me in something, instead of having a profession chosen by me, or being allowed to choose one, I returned home to devote myself to complete idleness; and during the following year, I lacked even the nominal occupation that university membership would have given me, since I did not enter Oxford until I was nineteen.</t5063> <t5064>I had, therefore, nothing at all to do, except to believe myself in love; and as my mother did not make the home truly pleasant, as I found neither a friend nor a companion in my brother and disliked meeting new people, it is not surprising that I often went to Longstaple, which I always felt was my home and where I was sure to be welcomed; thus, I spent most of my time there between the ages of eighteen and nineteen.</t5064> <t5065>I saw in Lucy everything that is kind and agreeable.</t5065> <t5066>She was pretty too... at least I thought so at the time; and I knew so few women that I could not make comparisons or detect flaws.</t5066> <t5067>Taking everything into account, therefore, I believe that as foolish as our engagement was, as foolish as it turned out to be in every sense, at that time it was not a sign of strange or inexcusable foolishness.</t5067>
<t5068>The change that a few hours had produced in the mood and happiness of the Dashwoods was so great, so great, that they could not help but expect all the satisfactions of a sleepless night.</t5068> <t5069>Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to achieve any tranquility, did not know how to show her love to Edward or praise Elinor sufficiently, how to thank enough for her liberation without compromising her delicacy, nor how to offer them the opportunity to converse freely among themselves while at the same time enjoying, as was her desire, the presence and company of both.</t5069>
<t5070>Marianne could only express her happiness through tears.</t5070> <t5071>She could fall into comparisons, into laments; and her joy, although as sincere as her love for her sister, neither lifted her spirits nor could it be put into words.</t5071>
<t5072>But Elinor, how to describe her feelings?</t5072> <t5073>From the moment she knew that Lucy had married another, that Edward was free, until the instant he justified the hopes that had so immediately followed, she experienced all emotions alternately, except calmness.</t5073> <t5074>But when the second moment had passed—when all her doubts, all her worries disappeared; when she could compare her situation with the recent past; when she saw him honorably free from his previous commitment; when she saw that he used his freedom to approach her and declare a love so tender, so constant as she had always supposed—she felt overwhelmed, dominated by her own happiness; and despite the fortunate tendency of the human mind to quickly accept any change for the better, it took several hours to restore serenity to her mind or some degree of tranquility to her heart.</t5074>
<t5075>Edward would now stay at least a week in the cabin, for beyond any other obligation he had to fulfill, it was impossible for him to spend less than a week enjoying Elinor's company, or for them to say in less time half of what they needed to say about the past, the present, and the future; for although a few hours spent in the difficult task of talking incessantly are enough to cover more topics than two rational creatures can really have in common, with lovers it is different.</t5075> <t5076>Between them, no matter is ever considered finished nor anything communicated unless it has been repeated twenty times.</t5076>
<t5077>Lucy’s marriage, the inexhaustible and explicable surprise it had caused everyone, of course fueled one of the first conversations of the lovers; and the particular knowledge that Elinor had of each of the parties made it, from every point of view, seem to her one of the most extraordinary and inconceivable circumstances that had ever reached her ears.</t5077> <t5078>How they had come together, and what attraction could have influenced Robert to marry a girl whose beauty he himself had spoken of without any admiration; a girl who was also engaged to his brother and for whom that brother had been marginalized from the family, was more than she could comprehend.</t5078> <t5079>To her heart, it was something marvelous; to her imagination, even ridiculous; but to her reason, to her judgment, it seemed a true enigma.</t5079>
<t5080>The only explanation that occurred to Edward was that, perhaps, having first met by chance, the vanity of one had been so well worked by the flattery of the other that it had gradually led to everything else.</t5080> <t5081>Elinor remembered what Robert had commented on Harley Street about how much he could have achieved if he had intervened in his brother's affairs in time.</t5081> <t5082>She told Edward about it.</t5082>
<t5083>—That is very typical of Robert —was his immediate comment—.</t5083> <t5084>And it is what he surely had in mind —he added later— at the beginning of his relationship with Lucy.</t5084> <t5085>And at the beginning, perhaps all she also wanted was to get him to intercede on my behalf.</t5085> <t5086>Later, other plans may have arisen.</t5086>
<t5087>For how long this had been happening between them, he could not imagine either, for in Oxford, where he had chosen to stay since his departure from London, he had no way of knowing about her except through her own letters, and until the last moment, her letters had been neither less frequent nor less affectionate than they had always been.</t5087> <t5088>Not the slightest suspicion, then, prepared him for what was to follow; and when the news finally broke in a letter from Lucy herself, he believed that for some time he had been stunned between wonder, horror, and the joy of such a release.</t5088> <t5089>He placed the letter in Elinor's hands:</t5089>
<t5090>Dear Sir,</t5090>
<t5091>With the certainty of having lost your affection long ago, I have felt free to give mine to another person, and I do not doubt that with him I will be as happy as I used to think I would be with you; but I refuse to accept the hand when the heart belonged to another.</t5091> <t5092>I sincerely wish you to be happy with your choice, and it will not be my fault if we are not always good friends, as our close kinship now makes appropriate.</t5092> <t5093>Without any doubt, I can tell you that I bear no resentment towards you, and I am sure you will be too generous to do anything that would harm us.</t5093> <t5094>Your brother has won all my affection, and as we could not live without each other, we have just returned from the altar and are now heading to Dawlish to spend a few weeks, a place your dear brother is very curious to know, but I thought to bother you first with these few lines, and forever I will remain,</t5094>
<t5095>Your sincere friend and sister, who cares for you dearly,</t5095>
<t5096>Lucy Ferrars</t5096>
<t5097>I have burned all his letters, and I will return his portrait at the first opportunity.</t5097> <t5098>Please destroy the pages I have sent you with my poor phrases; but the ring with my hair, I will be most pleased to leave it with you.</t5098>
<t5099>Elinor read it and returned it without any comment.</t5099>
<t5100>—I won't ask you what you think of her in terms of composition —said Edward—.</t5100> <t5101>For nothing in the world would I have wanted, in former times, for you to see one of her letters.</t5101> <t5102>In a sister-in-law it's already bad enough,—but in a wife!</t5102> <t5103>How some of her pages have made me blush!</t5103> <t5104>And I think I can say that since the first six months of our reckless... affair, this is the only letter I've received from her where the content made up for the faults in style.</t5104>
<t5105>—However it may have begun —said Elinor after a pause—, they are certainly married.</t5105> <t5106>And your mother has earned a very just punishment.</t5106> <t5107>The financial independence she granted Robert out of resentment towards you has allowed him to choose as he pleases; and, in fact, she has been bribing one son with a thousand pounds a year to end up doing the same thing that made her disinherit the other when he tried.</t5107> <t5108>I suppose it will hardly hurt her less to see Lucy married to Robert than to you.</t5108>
<t5109>—It will hurt her more, because Robert was always her favorite.</t5109> <t5110>It will hurt her more and, according to the same principle, she will forgive him much faster.</t5110>
<t5111>Edward did not know where their relationship stood at that moment, as he had made no attempt to communicate with anyone in his family.</t5111> <t5112>He had left Oxford within twenty-four hours of receiving Lucy's letter, and having.</t5112> <t5113>in mind the sole objective of finding the quickest way to Barton, he had not had time to devise any plan of conduct that was not intimately linked to that path.</t5113> <t5114>He could do nothing until he was sure of what his fate with Miss Dashwood would be; and it is to be supposed that by his quickness in facing that fate, despite the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, despite the modesty with which he assessed his own merits and the gentleness with which he spoke of his doubts, ultimately he did not expect too cruel a reception.</t5114> <t5115>However, he had to admit that he had feared it, and he did so with very nice words.</t5115> <t5116>What he might say on the subject a year later is left to the imagination of husbands and wives.</t5116>
<t5117>Elinor had no doubt that with the message she had sent through Thomas, Lucy had certainly intended to deceive, marking her departure with a stroke of malice against him; and Edward himself, now seeing clearly what her character was, found it easy to believe her capable of the utmost malevolence in a capricious meanness.</t5117> <t5118>Although for some time, even before his relationship with Elinor, he had begun to be aware of the ignorance and narrowness of some of her opinions, he had attributed it to the deficiencies of her education; and until the receipt of her last letter, he had always believed her to be a well-meaning girl with a good heart, and very attached to him.</t5118> <t5119>Nothing but that conviction could have prevented him from ending an engagement that, even long before its discovery made him the object of his mother's anger, had been for him a continuous source of uneasiness and regret.</t5119>
<t5120>—I thought it was my duty —he said—, regardless of my feelings, to give her the option to continue or not the engagement when my mother disowned me and I was left without a friend in the world to lend me a hand.</t5120> <t5121>In a situation like that, where there seemed to be nothing that could tempt the greed or vanity of any living creature, how could I suppose, when she insisted so intensely and passionately on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that her motives were anything other than the most selfless affection?</t5121> <t5122>And even now, I cannot understand what led her or what advantage she imagined she would gain by chaining herself to a man whom she did not esteem at all and whose only possession in the world was a thousand pounds.</t5122> <t5123>She could not have foreseen that Colonel Brandon would grant me a benefit.</t5123>
<t5124>—No, but she could suppose that something favorable might happen to you; that, in time, your own family might soften.</t5124> <t5125>And in any case, she lost nothing by continuing with the engagement, for, as she made it very clear, she did not feel bound by it either in her desires or in her actions.</t5125> <t5126>In any case, it was a respectable relationship and probably made her gain in the consideration of her friends; and if nothing better came along, it was better for her to marry you than to stay single.</t5126>
<t5127>Of course, Edward immediately convinced himself that nothing could be more natural than Lucy's behavior, nor more obvious than her motives.</t5127>
<t5128>Elinor reproached her for having spent so much time with them at Norland, where she should have been aware of her own fickleness, with the harshness that ladies always use when reprimanding the imprudence that flatters them.</t5128>
<t5129>—You behaved very badly —he told her—, because, not to mention my own convictions, you led our friends to imagine and expect something that, given your situation at that moment, could not happen.</t5129>
<t5130>Edward could only offer as an excuse the ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken confidence in the strength of his commitment.</t5130>
<t5131>—I was foolish enough to believe that, since I had given my word to another person, there was no danger in being with you, and that the awareness of my commitment would safeguard my feelings, making them as secure and sacred as my honor.</t5131> <t5132>I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship; and it wasn't until I began to compare you with Lucy that I realized how far it had gone.</t5132> <t5133>After that, I suppose it wasn't right to stay so long in Sussex, and the arguments I used to try to reconcile myself with the convenience of doing so were no better than these: it is myself I put in danger; I harm no one but myself.</t5133>
<t5134>Elinor smiled, shaking her head.</t5134>
<t5135>Edward was pleased to learn that they were expecting Colonel Brandon's visit to the house, for he not only wished to know him better, but to convince him that he no longer resented having been given the benefice of Delaford. "For with the unenthusiastic thanks he received from me on that occasion," he said, "he may still believe that I have not yet forgiven him for offering it to me."</t5135>
<t5136>He was now amazed that he had not yet gone to see the place.</t5136> <t5137>But he had shown so little interest in the whole matter that everything he knew about the house, the garden and the beneficial lands, the extent of the parish, the conditions of the land, and the amount of the tithes, he owed to Elinor herself, who had listened so many times to Colonel Brandon and had paid such close attention that she now had complete mastery over the subject.</t5137>
<t5138>After all this, there was only one thing left unresolved between them, one difficulty to overcome.</t5138> <t5139>They were united by their mutual affection and had the warmest approval of their true friends; the intimate knowledge they had of each other was a secure foundation for their happiness... and they only lacked a means to live.</t5139> <t5140>Edward had two thousand pounds and Elinor one thousand, and added to that the benefit of Delaford, it was all they could consider as their own; for Mrs. Dashwood was unable to advance them anything, and neither of them was so in love as to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a year would suffice to provide them with all the comforts of life.</t5140>
<t5141>Edward did not completely despair of a favorable change towards him from his mother, and in that he rested for what was lacking in his income.</t5141> <t5142>But Elinor did not have the same confidence; for as Edward was still unable to marry Miss Morton and, in her flattering language, Mrs. Ferrars had referred to the union with her only as a lesser evil compared to his choice of Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offense would only serve to enrich Fanny.</t5142>
<t5143>Four days after Edward's arrival, Colonel Brandon appeared, completing Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction and allowing her, for the first time since living in Barton, to have more company than her house could accommodate.</t5143> <t5144>Edward was allowed to retain his privileges as the first visitor, and thus Colonel Brandon had to go every night to his former quarters on the estate, from which he returned every morning early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tête-à-tête after breakfast.</t5144>
<t5145>After three weeks of staying in Delaford, where, at least in the evenings, he had little to do except calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and sixteen, Colonel Brandon arrived in Barton in such a depressed state of mind that, to cheer up, he required all the improvement in Marianne's appearance, all the affability of her reception, and all the encouragement from her mother's words.</t5145> <t5146>Among such friends, however, and with such flattery, he soon revived.</t5146> <t5147>No rumor had yet reached him about Lucy's marriage; he knew nothing of what had happened and, consequently, spent the first hours of his visit listening and being astonished.</t5147> <t5148>Mrs. Dashwood explained everything to him, giving him new reasons to be glad for the service rendered to Mr. Ferrars, since it ultimately resulted in Elinor's benefit.</t5148>
<t5149>It would be unnecessary to say that the good opinion the gentlemen had of each other improved along with their increasing mutual knowledge, for it could not have been otherwise.</t5149> <t5150>The similarity in their principles and good judgment, in disposition and way of thinking, would probably have been enough to unite them as friends without the need for anything else to bring them closer; but the fact that they were in love with two sisters, and two sisters who loved each other, made an appreciation inevitable and immediate that under other conditions might have had to wait for the effects of time and discernment.</t5150>
<t5151>The letters coming from the city, which just a few days earlier would have shaken every nerve in Elinor's body, now arrived to be read with less emotion than pleasure.</t5151> <t5152>Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell them the whole fantastic story, to vent her honest indignation against the fickle girl who had left her fiancé and to pour out compassion for poor Edward who, she was sure, had adored that despicable rogue and, according to all reports, was now in Oxford with his heart almost completely broken.</t5152> <t5153>“In my opinion,” she continued, “nothing has ever been done so slyly, for it was not even two days ago that Lucy had come to visit me and had stayed with me for a couple of hours.</t5153> <t5154>No one had any suspicion of what was happening, not even Nancy who, poor creature, came here crying the next day, terribly alarmed for fear of Mrs. Ferrars and not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy, it seems, had borrowed all her money before getting married, we suppose to show off, and poor Nancy did not even have seven shillings in total; so I was very glad to give her five guineas to get her to Exeter, where she plans to stay for three or four weeks at Mrs. Burguess's house with the hope, as I tell her, of running into the reverend again.</t5154> <t5155>And I must confess that the worst of all is Lucy's ill will in not taking her in her carriage.</t5155> <t5156>Poor Mr. Edward! I can't get him out of my head, but you must make him go to Barton and Miss Marianne must try to console him.”</t5156>
<t5157>Mr. Dashwood's tone was more solemn.</t5157> <t5158>Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women, the sensitivity of poor Fanny had endured agonies, and he was amazed and full of gratitude to see that they had not succumbed under such a blow.</t5158> <t5159>Robert's offense was unforgivable, but Lucy's was infinitely worse.</t5159> <t5160>The names of neither of them were ever to be mentioned again in Mrs. Ferrars' presence, and even if in the future she could be convinced to forgive her son, she would never recognize his wife as a daughter nor admit her into her presence.</t5160> <t5161>He rationally treated the secrecy with which they had handled the whole matter between them as a huge aggravation of the crime, for if others had suspected anything, they could have taken the necessary measures to prevent the marriage; and he appealed to Elinor to join him in lamenting the unfulfillment of the engagement between Lucy and Edward, rather than using it to continue sowing misfortune in the family.</t5161> <t5162>And he continued as follows:</t5162>
<t5163>“Mrs. Ferrars has still not mentioned Edward's name, which does not surprise us; but what astonishes us greatly is not having received a single line from him about what happened.</t5163> <t5164>Perhaps, however, he has remained silent for fear of offending, and therefore I will write a few lines to Oxford suggesting that his sister and I think a letter showing appropriate submission, perhaps addressed to Fanny and shown by her to her mother, would not be taken amiss; for we all know Mrs. Ferrars' tender heart and that nothing she desires more than to be on good terms with her children.”</t5164>
<t5165>This paragraph had a certain importance for Edward's plans and actions.</t5165> <t5166>It led him to attempt a reconciliation, although not exactly in the way suggested by his brother-in-law and his sister.</t5166>
<t5167>—The proper submission! —he repeated—; Do they expect me to apologize to my mother for Robert's ingratitude towards her and the way he offended my honor?</t5167> <t5168>I cannot show any submission.</t5168> <t5169>What happened has not made me more humble nor more repentant.</t5169> <t5170>It has made me very happy, but that does not concern them.</t5170> <t5171>I do not know of any gesture of submission that I should make.</t5171>
<t5172>—You may well ask for forgiveness —said Elinor—, because you have offended; and I would think that now you might even express some regret for having made the commitment that aroused your mother's anger.</t5172>
<t5173>Edward agreed that he could do it.</t5173>
<t5174>—And when I have forgiven you, it might be advisable to show a little humility when you inform your mother of a second engagement almost as imprudent in her eyes as the first.</t5174>
<t5175>Edward had nothing to object to this, but he still resisted the idea of a letter in which he showed appropriate submission; and so, to make the task easier for him, given that he showed much more willingness to make concessions verbally than in writing, it was decided that instead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London and personally beg her to intercede on his behalf.</t5175>
<t5176>—And if they do commit —said Marianne, in her new benevolent personality striving for a reconciliation, I will have to think that not even John and Fanny are completely devoid of merits.</t5176>
<t5177>After the mere three or four days that Colonel Brandon's visit lasted, the two gentlemen left Barton together.</t5177> <t5178>They would head immediately to Delaford, so that Edward could personally get to know his future home and help his protector and friend decide what improvements were necessary; and from there, after staying a couple of nights, he would continue his journey to the city.</t5178>
<t5179>CHAPTER L</t5179>
<t5180>After the appropriate resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, a resistance quite energetic and firm to save her from the reproach in which she always seemed fearful of incurring, that of being too kind, Edward was admitted into her presence and elevated once again to the category of son.</t5180>
<t5181>In recent times, her family had been extremely fluctuating.</t5181> <t5182>For many years of her life, she had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago had deprived her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her without any for fifteen days; and now, with Edward's resurrection, she had one again.</t5182>
<t5183>Edward, however, despite being allowed to live once again, did not feel secure about the continuation of his existence until he had revealed his current engagement; for he feared that making such a circumstance public would give a new turn to his state and lead him to the grave with the same speed as before.</t5183> <t5184>He then revealed it with cautious wariness and was listened to with unexpected placidity.</t5184> <t5185>At first, Mrs. Ferrars tried to reason with him to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood, using all the arguments at her disposal; she told him that in Miss Morton he would find a woman of higher rank and greater fortune, and reinforced this assertion by noting that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman and owner of thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman and had no more than three thousand; but when she discovered that although Edward perfectly agreed with the accuracy of her exposition, he had no intention of being guided by it, she deemed it wiser, given past experience, to submit...</t5185> <t5186>And so, after the disdainful delay she owed to her own dignity and which she found necessary to prevent any suspicion of benevolence, —she promulgated her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.</t5186>
<t5187>The next step was to consider what needed to be done to improve his income: and here it was clearly seen that although Edward was now his only son, he was by no means the firstborn; for although Robert infallibly received a thousand pounds a year, no objection was made to Edward being ordained for two hundred and fifty at most; nor was anything promised for the present or the future beyond the same ten thousand pounds that had constituted Fanny's dowry.</t5187>
<t5188>That, however, was what Edward and Elinor desired, and much more than they expected; and Mrs. Ferrars, with her evasive excuses, seemed to be the only person surprised not to give more.</t5188>
<t5189>Thus, having been assured a sufficient income to cover their needs, after Edward took possession of the benefice, there was nothing left for them to wait for except for the house to be ready, to which Colonel Brandon was making significant improvements in his anxiety to accommodate Elinor; and after waiting some time for them to be completed—after experiencing, as usual, the thousand disappointments and delays of the inexplicable slowness of the workers—Elinor, as always, broke the firm initial decision not to marry until everything was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton Church at the beginning of autumn.</t5189>
<t5190>They spent the first month after their marriage at the manor house, from where they could supervise the progress at the rectory and manage things just as they wanted on-site; they could choose the wallpaper, plan where to plant groups of shrubs, and design a path to the house.</t5190> <t5191>Mrs. Jennings' prophecies, although somewhat muddled, were mostly fulfilled: she was able to visit Edward and his wife in the parish by Michaelmas, and found in Elinor and her husband, as she had thought, one of the happiest couples in the world.</t5191> <t5192>In fact, neither Edward nor Elinor had any unfulfilled desires, except for Colonel Brandon and Marianne's marriage and slightly better pastures for their cows.</t5192>
<t5193>They received visits from almost all their relatives and friends as soon as they settled in.</t5193> <t5194>Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness she was almost ashamed to have authorized, and even the Dashwoods incurred the expense of a trip from Sussex to pay their respects.</t5194>
<t5195>—I won't say that I'm disappointed, my dear sister —said John, as they walked together one morning in front of the gates of Delaford House—; that would be an exaggeration, since as things are, you have indeed turned out to be one of the luckiest women in the world.</t5195> <t5196>But I confess that it would give me great pleasure to be able to call Colonel Brandon my brother.</t5196> <t5197>His estate in this place, his property, his house, all so admirable, in such magnificent condition!</t5197> <t5198>And his woods!</t5198> <t5199>Nowhere in Dorsetshire have I seen timber of such quality as that now stored in the sheds of Delaford!</t5199> <t5200>And although Marianne may not be exactly the person capable of attracting him, I think it would generally be advisable for you to invite her very often to stay with you, since Colonel Brandon seems to spend a lot of time at home... it's impossible to say what might happen...</t5200> <t5201>When two people are together a lot and don't see much of anyone else...</t5201> <t5202>And it will always be in your hands to highlight her best side, and all that; in short, you can well offer her an opportunity... you understand me.</t5202>
<t5203>But although Mrs. Ferrars did come to see them and always treated them with a feigned decorous affection, they never received the insult of her true favor and preferences.</t5203> <t5204>That had been earned by Robert’s foolishness and his wife’s cunning, and they had achieved it before many months had passed.</t5204> <t5205>Lucy’s selfish shrewdness, which had initially dragged Robert into such a mess, was the main instrument to free him from it; for as soon as she found the smallest opportunity to exercise them, her respectful humility, her assiduous attentions, and endless flattery reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to her son's choice and completely reinstated her in her favor.</t5205>
<t5206>All of Lucy's conduct in this matter and the prosperity with which it was crowned can thus be exhibited as a very encouraging example of what intense, incessant attention to one's own interests, no matter how many obstacles seem to lie in the way, can do to achieve all the advantages of fortune, without sacrificing anything but time and conscience.</t5206> <t5207>The first time Robert sought to see her and visited her at Bartlett's Buildings, his only intention was the one his brother attributed to him.</t5207> <t5208>He only wanted to convince her to desist from the engagement; and as the only obstacle he imagined possible was the affection of both, he logically expected that one or two interviews would suffice to resolve the matter.</t5208> <t5209>In that point, however, and only in that, he was mistaken; for although Lucy very soon made him believe that, in the long run, his eloquence would convince her, another visit, another conversation was always needed to achieve such conviction.</t5209> <t5210>Upon parting, there always remained in her mind some doubts, which could only be clarified with another half-hour conversation with him.</t5210> <t5211>In this way, she ensured a new visit, and the rest followed its natural course.</t5211> <t5212>Instead of talking about Edward, they gradually came to talk only about Robert... a topic on which he always had more to say than the other and in which she soon showed an interest that almost equaled his; and, in short, it quickly became evident to both that he had completely supplanted his brother.</t5212> <t5213>He was proud of his conquest, proud of playing a trick on Edward, and very proud of marrying in private without his mother's consent.</t5213> <t5214>What followed immediately is already known.</t5214> <t5215>They spent some very happy months in Dawlish, for she had many relatives and old acquaintances with whom she wished to cut ties, and he drew many plans for magnificent country houses.</t5215> <t5216>And when they returned to the city from there, they obtained Mrs. Ferrars' forgiveness by the simple expedient of asking for it, a path adopted at the instigation of — Lucy.</t5216> <t5217>At first, logically, the forgiveness extended only to Robert; and Lucy, who had no obligation to her mother-in-law and therefore had not transgressed anything, remained a few weeks longer without being forgiven.</t5217> <t5218>But perseverance in humble behavior, plus messages where she assumed the blame for Robert's offense and gratitude for the harshness with which she was treated, eventually procured her a haughty acknowledgment of her existence that overwhelmed her with its condescension and then led her very quickly to the highest state of affection and influence.</t5218> <t5219>Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars as Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never wholeheartedly forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to Lucy in fortune and birth, was referred to as an intruder, she was always considered and openly recognized as a favorite daughter.</t5219> <t5220>They settled in the city, received very generous support from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best imaginable terms with the Dashwoods, and, setting aside the jealousy and ill will that continued to exist between Fanny and Lucy, in which of course their husbands took part, along with the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could surpass the harmony in which they all lived together.</t5220>
<t5221>What Edward had done to see his rights of primogeniture alienated might have surprised many, had they discovered it;.</t5221> <t5222>and what Robert had done to be the successor of those rights would surprise them even more.</t5222> <t5223>It was, however, an arrangement justified by its consequences, if not by its cause; for there was never any sign in Robert's lifestyle or in his words that would make one suspect he regretted the magnitude of his income, whether it left too little for his brother or assigned too much to him; and if one could judge Edward by his prompt fulfillment of his duties in every matter, by an ever-growing attachment to his wife and home, and by the constant joy of his spirit, one might suppose him no less content with his lot than his brother and no less free from wishing any change in it.</t5223>
<t5224>Elinor's marriage only separated her from her family to the minimal extent necessary to prevent the Barton cottage from being completely abandoned, as her mother and sisters spent more than half their time with her.</t5224> <t5225>Mrs. Dashwood's frequent visits to Delaford were motivated as much by pleasure as by prudence; for her desire to unite Marianne and Colonel Brandon was only slightly less pronounced, though somewhat more generous, than that expressed by John.</t5225> <t5226>It was now her favorite cause.</t5226> <t5227>As precious as her daughter's company was to her, nothing did she desire more than to relinquish it for the sake of her esteemed friend; and seeing Marianne settled in the manor house was also the wish of Edward and Elinor.</t5227> <t5228>Everyone sympathized with the Colonel's sorrows and felt responsible for alleviating them; and Marianne, by general consensus, was to be the comfort for all of them.</t5228>
<t5229>With such an alliance against her; with the intimate knowledge of the colonel's kindness; with the conviction of the enormous affection he had for her, which finally, although much later than it had become evident to everyone else, dawned on her, what could she do?</t5229>
<t5230>Marianne Dashwood had been born destined for something extraordinary.</t5230> <t5231>She was born to discover the falseness of her own opinions and to challenge her favorite maxims with her actions.</t5231> <t5232>She was born to overcome an affection that arose at the age of seventeen, and without any feeling superior to great appreciation and deep friendship, she voluntarily gave her hand to another!</t5232> <t5233>And that other was a man who had suffered no less than she had due to an old affection; whom she had considered too old for marriage two years earlier, and who still sought to protect his health with a flannel shirt!</t5233>
<t5234>But that's how things happened.</t5234> <t5235>Instead of being sacrificed to an irresistible passion, as she had once prided herself on imagining; even instead of staying forever with her mother with solitude and study as her only pleasures, as she had later decided when her judgment became calmer and more sober, she found herself at nineteen years old submitting to new bonds, accepting new duties, settled in a new home, wife, mistress of a house, and lady of a village.</t5235>
<t5236>Colonel Brandon was now as happy as everyone who cared for him believed he deserved to be; in Marianne, he found solace for all his past afflictions; her affection and company revived his mind and restored joy to his spirit; and that Marianne found her own happiness in making him happy was something undeniable to every friend who saw her and delighted everyone.</t5236> <t5237>Marianne could never love halfway; and in time, she came to give her whole heart to her husband, as she had once done with Willoughby.</t5237>
<t5238>Willoughby could not hear of Marianne's marriage without feeling a pang of pain; and soon his punishment was complete with Mrs. Smith's voluntary forgiveness, who, in declaring that he owed her clemency to his marriage with a woman of character, gave him reason to think that, had he acted honorably with Marianne, he might have been both happy and wealthy at the same time.</t5238> <t5239>The sincerity of his remorse for his wrongdoing, which had brought about his own punishment, should not be doubted; nor should it be doubted that for a long time he thought of Colonel Brandon with envy and of Marianne with longing.</t5239> <t5240>But one should not expect that he remained forever inconsolable, that he shunned society or developed a habitually gloomy temperament, or that he died of a broken heart... because none of that happened.</t5240> <t5241>He lived striving, and often enjoying himself.</t5241> <t5242>His wife was not always in a bad mood nor was his home lacking in comforts!</t5242> <t5243>And in his kennels and stables and in all kinds of sports he found a not insignificant degree of domestic happiness.</t5243>
<t5244>For Marianne, however—despite the discourtesy of having survived her loss—he always maintained that resolute affection that made him interested in all her affairs and led him to transform her into his secret standard of feminine perfection; and thus, many promising beauties ended up being disregarded by him after a few days, as if they were no match for Mrs. Brandon.</t5244>
<t5245>Mrs. Dashwood had the prudence to stay at the cottage, without attempting a move to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, at the moment they were deprived of Marianne, Margaret had reached a very suitable age for dancing and could already be presumed to have admirers.</t5245>
<t5246>Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication that naturally arises from great familial affection; and among the merits and joys of Elinor and Marianne, one must not overlook the fact that, although sisters and living almost within sight of each other, they were able to do so without disagreements between them or causing tensions between their husbands.</t5246>
