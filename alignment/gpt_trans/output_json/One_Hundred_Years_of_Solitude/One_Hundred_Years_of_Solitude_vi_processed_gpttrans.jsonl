watching his brothers enthusiastically engage in endless and fascinating games, decided to invite everyone to stay and work with him.</t3257>\n    <t3258>The only one who accepted the invitation was

foreheads.</t3263>\n    <t3264>Back home, the youngest, wanting to wipe his forehead, discovered that the ash mark could not be washed off, and soon after, he realized that his brothers' ash marks were also indelible.</t3264>\n    <t3265>They tried soap and water, then dirt and scrubbing paste, then pumice stone and lye, but nothing could erase the cross on their foreheads.</t3265>\n    <t3266>In contrast, Amaranta and the others who attended mass easily wiped off their crosses.</t3266>\n    <t3267>\"It's better that they leave like this,\" \u00darsula said, \"From now on, no one can mistake them.\"</t3267>\n    <t3268>They left noisily amid fireworks and music, leaving the impression that the Buend\u00eda family had sown its seed everywhere for eternity.</t3268>\n    <t3269>Aureliano Triste, with the gray ash cross on his forehead, established an ice factory on the outskirts of the village, fulfilling Jos\u00e9 Arcadio Buend\u00eda's long-held dream in his

didn't fully realize how much the omens had abandoned him, and while the coffee boiled, purely out of curiosity and without a hint of nostalgia, he continued to think about the woman whose name he never knew and whose face he never clearly saw because she had stumbled in the dark to find his hammock.</t3789> <t3790>However, among the many women who had come into his life in that manner, he didn't remember that she was the one who, in that first emotional encounter, had nearly drowned in her tears and had promised to love him forever, even until death, less than an hour before she died.</t3790> <t3791>He didn't think about her anymore, nor would he think about anyone else, once he entered the goldsmith's workshop, lit the lamp, and counted the goldfish in the tin box.</t3791> <t3792>Ten in total, since deciding not to sell them anymore, he made only two a day, and when he had twenty-five, he melted them down to start over.</t3792> <t3793>He worked diligently all morning,

taken anything with her.</t4887>\n<t4888>For the first time in her life, Fernanda lit the stove and burned her hand, then had to ask Aureliano to show her how to make coffee.</t4888>\n<t4889>From then on, it was Aureliano who did the cooking.</t4889>\n<t4890>When Fernanda woke up, the food was already prepared by Aureliano and kept warm in the hot ashes; she only needed to leave her bedroom to fetch it and eat at a table covered with a linen cloth, with candles placed on top; when eating, she sat on the innermost chair of fifteen empty chairs.</t4890>\n<t4891>In that setting, Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their loneliness with each other, but each minded their own business.</t4891>\n<t4892>They cleaned their own rooms while cobwebs spread over the rose bushes, covered the rafters, and wove across the walls.</t4892>\n<t4893>It was during this period that Fernanda had the impression that the house was full of ghosts.</t4893>\n<t4894>It was no wonder that objects, especially those used daily, always seemed to change places on their own.</t4894>\n<t4895>Fernanda spent time searching for the scissors she was sure she had left on the bed, only to find them in the kitchen cabinet after rummaging everywhere, a place she believed she hadn't set foot in for four days.</t4895>\n<t4896>Suddenly, there were no plates left in the cupboard, only to find six on the altar and three in the sink.</t4896>\n<t4897>When Fernanda sat down to write, she found the objects moved even more unexpectedly.</t4897>\n<t4898>The inkwell placed on the right would later be found on the left, the blotter disappeared and reappeared two days later under her pillow, the pages written for Jos\u00e9 Arcadio mixed with those for Amaranta \u00darsula, and she always worried that she had put the wrong letter in the wrong envelope, as had happened many times before.</t4898>\n<t4899>Once, she lost her pen.</t4899>\n<t4900>Fifteen days later, the mailman returned it.</t4900>\n<t4901>He had found it in his pocket and had gone around asking whose pen it was.</t4901>\n<t4902>At first, Fernanda believed these incidents were caused by invisible doctors, similar to the disappearance of the uterine rings earlier, and she began writing a letter asking them to leave her alone, but then she had to stop to do something else, and when she returned to her room, not only was the letter gone, but she had also forgotten why she was writing it in the first place.</t4902>\n<t4903>For a while, she thought it was Aureliano.</t4903>\n<t4904>She watched Aureliano, placing objects in his path with the intention of catching him moving them from one place to another, but soon she was convinced that Aureliano never left Melqu\u00edades' room unless he needed to go to the kitchen or the bathroom, and he wasn't the type to play pranks.</t4904>\n<t4905>Finally, Fernanda believed it was the work of ghosts and decided to deal with it by securing everything in its proper place.</t4905>\n<t4906>She tied the scissors to the headboard with a long string, tied the pen and blotter to the table leg, and glued the inkwell to the table on the right side where she usually sat to write.</t4906>\n<t4907>But things didn't go smoothly, because just as she was sewing for a while, she couldn't pull the scissors to where she needed to cut, as if the string had been shortened by ghosts.</t4907>\n<t4908>The string tied to the pen was the same, and even Fernanda's arm seemed to shorten, because after writing for a while, she couldn't reach the inkwell anymore.</t4908>\n<t4909>Neither Amaranta \u00darsula in Brussels nor Jos\u00e9 Arcadio in Rome ever knew about these misfortunes.</t4909>\n<t4910>Fernanda wrote to her children that she was living happily, and indeed she was, because she felt free from all constraints, as if life was pulling her back to her parents' world, where she wouldn't have to suffer daily troubles because they were resolved in her imagination.</t4910>\n<t4911>The correspondence with her children made Fernanda lose track of time, especially since Santa Sof\u00eda de la Piedad had left.</t4911>\n<t4912>Previously, she had the habit of counting days, months, and years to see how long it would be before her children returned as planned.</t4912>\n<t4913>But when they repeatedly informed her of changed plans, she

However, since Melquiades had told him that the wise Catalonian's bookstore had books that would help him understand the parchments, he decided to ask Fernanda for permission to get those books.</t4920> <t4921>In the room full of broken tiles - the increasing number of which would eventually cause the room to collapse - Aureliano pondered how to appropriately present his request, anticipating the right moment and opportunity, but when he saw Fernanda taking food stored in hot ashes - the only chance to speak to her - the carefully prepared words stuck in his throat, unable to be spoken.</t4921> <t4922>That was the only time Aureliano followed Fernanda.</t4922> <t4923>He listened to the sound of Fernanda's footsteps in the bedroom.</t4923> <t4924>He heard her stepping out to receive letters from her children and send the letters she wrote to them; late at night, he still heard the sound of the pen pressing hard on the paper before hearing the light being turned off and the murmured prayers in the dark.</t4924> <t4925>Only then did Aureliano fall asleep, believing that the opportunity he longed for would come the next day.</t4925> <t4926>Aureliano was under the illusion that his request would not be denied, so one morning he cut his shoulder-length hair, shaved his stubbly beard, put on tight pants and a shirt with a false collar, not knowing whom he had inherited them from, and then went to the kitchen to wait for Fernanda to eat.</t4926> <t4927>But it was not the woman who lived there daily, the woman with her head held high, the woman who walked firmly, but an exquisitely beautiful old lady wearing a yellow mink coat, a gold-plated cardboard crown, and the fragile demeanor of someone who often cried silently.</t4927> <t4928>In fact, since seeing the beauty queen outfit moth-eaten in Aureliano Segundo's trunk, Fernanda had worn it many times.</t4928> <t4929>If anyone had seen her standing before the mirror with regal gestures, they would surely have thought she was mad.</t4929> <t4930>But that was not the case.</t4930> <t4931>Fernanda merely turned the beauty queen outfit into a memory machine.

Since ancient times, one thousand six hundred and three types of cockroaches had withstood humanity's relentless and merciless pursuit, a pursuit as persistent as humanity's own self-destructive tendencies. Along with the instinct to procreate, humans also had an instinct to kill cockroaches.
