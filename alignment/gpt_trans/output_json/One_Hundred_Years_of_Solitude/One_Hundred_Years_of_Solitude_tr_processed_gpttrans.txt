<t0>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, when he stood before the firing squad years later, would remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.</t0> <t1>At that time, Macondo was a village of twenty mud houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric eggs.</t1> <t2>The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point with one's finger.</t2> <t3>Every year in March, a ragged band of gypsies would set up their tents outside the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and drums, they would display new inventions.</t3> <t4>First, they brought the magnet.</t4> <t5>A hulking gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquiades, put on a captivating demonstration with what he proclaimed to be the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia.</t5>
<t6>As he dragged two ingots of metal from door to door, people saw pots and pans, tongs and braziers clattering and rolling from their places, nails and screws desperately trying to jump out of their sockets, causing the beams to creak, and especially the long-lost objects, which had been searched for extensively, tumbling out from their hiding places and rushing pell-mell after Melquiades' magical irons, leaving everyone dumbfounded.</t6> <t7>The gypsy, in his coarse accent, proclaimed, "Objects have a life of their own; all it takes is to awaken their souls."</t7> <t8>Jose Arcadio Buendia, whose unbridled imagination extended beyond the wonders of nature, the most improbable miracles, and even magic, thought that this useless invention could be used to extract gold from the earth's core.</t8> <t9>Melquiades, being an honest man, warned him, "It is useless for that."</t9>
<t10>Since Jose Arcadio Buendia did not trust the honesty of the gypsies at that time, he traded his mule and a pair of goats for two magnetic ingots.</t10> <t11>His wife, Ursula Iguaran, who relied on these animals to increase the few pieces of broken-down furniture and goods in the house, tried to dissuade him to no avail.</t11> <t12>Her husband said nothing but, "Very soon we will have enough gold to cover the floor of the house and then some," and to prove the correctness of his idea, he toiled for months.</t12> <t13>He scoured the entire region, dragging the two iron ingots behind him and shouting Melquiades' magical words, until he reached the riverbed.</t13> <t14>In the end, all he found was a fifteenth-century suit of armor, fused together by rust and making a hollow sound like a giant pumpkin filled with stones.</t14> <t15>When Jose Arcadio Buendia and his four-man exploration team managed to dismantle the armor, a calcified skeleton with a copper medallion around its neck containing a lock of woman's hair emerged from inside.</t15>
<t16>The gypsies came again.</t16> <t17>This time, they brought a magnifying glass the size of a drum, which they claimed was the latest invention of the Jews from Amsterdam.</t17> <t18>They placed a gypsy woman at the other end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance of their tent.</t18> <t19>Anyone who paid five reals could look through the telescope and see the gypsy woman as if she were just a yard away.</t19> <t20>Melquiades declared, Science has eliminated distance.</t20> <t21>Very soon, mankind will be able to see what is happening anywhere in the world without stepping out of their homes.</t21> <t22>The scorching midday heat showcased the astonishing demonstration of the giant magnifying glass: They piled up dry grass in the middle of the street and focused the sun's rays through the magnifying glass to set it on fire.</t22> <t23>Still unable to accept the failure of his magnets, Jose Arcadio Buendia decided to use this invention as a weapon of war.</t23> <t24>Although Melquiades tried to dissuade him again, he eventually accepted two magnetized ingots and three gold coins minted for the colonies in exchange for the magnifying glass.</t24>
<t25>Ursula cried and lamented.</t25> <t26>The money had been taken from the chest full of gold that her father had saved all his life without eating or drinking, and that Ursula had buried under her bed, saying "save for a rainy day."</t26> <t27>Jose Arcadio Buendia, a scientist so engrossed in his 'tactical' experiments that he would even risk his life, did not attempt to console his wife.</t27> <t28>While trying to demonstrate the effect of the magnifying glass on enemy troops, he got so severely burned by the sun focused through the magnifying glass that his entire body was covered with unhealing sores.</t28> <t29>Despite all the objections of his wife, who was terrified of such a dangerous invention, he even tried to set his own house on fire to see if it would catch.</t29>
<t30>Locking himself in his room for hours, calculating the possibilities of his new weapon, he finally produced a handbook whose instructive clarity was beyond question and whose persuasiveness was irresistible.</t30> <t31>He added a series of descriptions of the experiments he had conducted and a few pages of explanatory illustrations to the book, and sent it to the government with a courier.</t31> <t32>The courier, who crossed mountains, lost his way in endless swamps, battled raging rivers, and narrowly escaped death from despair, troubles, and wild animals, finally found the path that intersected with the road taken by the mules carrying the mail.</t32> <t33>Despite the impossibility of traveling to the capital at that time, Jose Arcadio Buendia promised to go to the capital as soon as the government ordered, to present a practical demonstration of his invention to the military authorities, and to teach those intricate war methods that operated with the sun.</t33> <t34>He waited for years for a response.</t34> <t35>Finally, tired of waiting, when he complained to Melquiades about the failure of his plan, the gypsy proved his honesty by giving him some Portuguese maps and tools for drawing expedition routes, in addition to the coins he had given in exchange for the magnifying glass.</t35>
<t36>After summarizing and writing by hand Keşiş Hermann's studies on how to use the astrolabe, compass, and sextant, he left them for Jose Arcadio.</t36> <t37>Jose Arcadio Buendia locked himself in a small room he built at the back of the house so that no one would disturb his experiments during the long rainy season that lasted for months.</t37> <t38>He completely abandoned his household responsibilities and spent nights observing the orbits of the stars in the garden, almost getting sunstroke in his quest to find an infallible method to determine noon.</t38> <t39>Once he mastered using and operating his instruments, he developed a new concept of space that allowed him to explore unknown seas and uncharted lands and interact with marvelous beings without leaving his desk.</t39> <t40>It was during this period that, while Ursula and the children exhausted themselves in the garden growing bananas, caladium, cassava, sweet potatoes, pumpkin roots, and eggplants, Jose Arcadio developed the habit of pacing around the house and talking to himself without looking at anyone.</t40>
<t41>Then this feverish activity suddenly ceased, giving way to a sort of enchantment.</t41> <t42>For a few days, as if bewitched, he kept repeating a series of assumptions one after another, not even sure if he understood them himself.</t42> <t43>Finally, on a Tuesday afternoon in December, he revealed the worm that had been eating him up inside.</t43> <t44>The dignified solemnity of their father, who was worn out from the wrath of his imagination and weeks of sleeplessness, as he explained his discovery, never left the children's minds:</t44>
<t45>-The world is round, just like an orange.</t45>
<t46>Ursula's patience ran out.</t46> <t47>If you intend to go mad, do it on your own!</t47> <t48>But don't try to fill the children's minds with those gypsy ideas! she shouted.</t48> <t49>Jose Arcadio Buendia, who did not bat an eye, was not frightened by his wife's unbalanced excessiveness, who, in her rage, smashed the astrolabe to the ground.</t49> <t50>He made a new astrolabe and gathered all the men of the village in his room, proving with theories that none of them could grasp that a boat constantly steering could return to the point where it first set out to sea.</t50> <t51>Just when the whole village was convinced that Jose Arcadio Buendia had lost his mind, Melquiades arrived and saved the situation.</t51> <t52>Although it was not known in Macondo at the time, Melquiades praised Jose Arcadio's superior intellect, who had independently developed a theory that had already been proven in practice by merely contemplating astronomy, in front of everyone and, as a token of his admiration, gave him a gift that would have a profound impact on the village's future: an alchemist's laboratory.</t52>
<t53>Meanwhile, Meiquiades had aged at an incredible speed.</t53> <t54>During his first visits, he appeared to be the same age as Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t54> <t55>However, while Jose Arcadio maintained his strength to bring down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been ravaged by a relentless ailment.</t55> <t56>In fact, this decline was the result of a rare assortment of diseases he had contracted during his countless journeys around the world.</t56> <t57>As he explained to Jose Arcadio Buendia while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the cuffs of his pants, but never quite deciding to strike the final blow.</t57>
<t58>The Gypsy had escaped from all the ailments and all the troubles that had devastated people.</t58> <t59>He had survived pellagra in Iran, scurvy in the Malay Archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, plague in Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a terrible shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan.</t59> <t60>This hulking creature, said to have deciphered Nostradamus's codes, was a gloomy man with an Asian appearance that suggested he knew the inner workings of everything, and a melancholic air.</t60> <t61>He wore a huge black hat like a raven with its wings spread, and a velvet vest where centuries-old mold ran rampant.</t61> <t62>But despite his boundless wisdom and mysterious depth, he had human worries and the troubles of the world that kept him busy with the trivialities of daily life.</t62> <t63>He complained of the ailments of old age, struggled with the slightest economic difficulties, and had long since stopped smiling because his teeth had fallen out due to scurvy.</t63> <t64>In that suffocating midday heat, when the Gypsy revealed his secrets, Jose Arcadio Buendia was absolutely convinced that this was the beginning of a deep friendship.</t64>
<t65>The children were left in awe by the incredible tales told by the Gypsy.</t65> <t66>Aureliano, who was only about five years old at the time, would always remember him as he first saw him, standing with his back to the gray, flickering light coming through the window, speaking in a sonorous voice that illuminated the darkest corners of the imagination, while sweat from the heat trickled down his temples.</t66> <t67>His brother Jose Arcadio would also pass down that unique image to all his descendants.</t67> <t68>However, for Ursula, who entered the room just as Melquiades dropped and broke the bottle of mercuric chloride, the memory of that first day was not at all pleasant.</t68>
<t69>Ursula said, "This is the smell of the Devil."</t69>
<t70>Melquiades, Not at all, he retorted.</t70> <t71>It has long been proven that sulfur characteristics exist in the devil, but this is just a bit of sublimation, that's all.</t71>
<t72>Then, with the demeanor of a teacher, he began to explain the diabolical characteristics of the cinnabar one by one.</t72> <t73>Ursula, however, without paying any attention, took the children to pray.</t73> <t74>From that day on, whenever Melquiades was mentioned, that sharp smell always came to Ursula's mind.</t74>
<t75>The makeshift laboratory consisted of a primitive water pipe with an array of bowls, funnels, alembics, filters, and sieves added to it, a long-necked glass carafe, a portable copy of the alchemist's stone, and a model of a three-armed Jewish Mary alembic made by the gypsies according to contemporary definitions.</t75> <t76>In addition to these, Melquiades left a series of notes and drawings explaining the processes of the Great Teaching, which would show the seven pieces of metal symbolizing the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimos for doubling gold, and the ways to make the alchemist's stone.</t76> <t77>Convinced by the simplicity of the formulas for doubling gold, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not leave Ursula alone for weeks, so that she would extract the colonial gold and he could multiply the gold as if he were dividing and multiplying mercury.</t77> <t78>As always, Ursula gave in to her husband's stubbornness.</t78>
<t79>Jose Arcadio Buendia put three colonial gold pieces into a pan, mixed them with copper shavings, yellow arsenic, sulfur, and lead, then threw them into a pot full of castor oil and boiled them until they turned into a thick and sticky paste that resembled wax more than gold.</t79> <t80>After being melted with metals symbolizing the seven planets through dangerous and desperate distillation processes, Ursula's precious paternal inheritance was mixed with alchemical mercury and Cyprus vitriol, and when cooked with lard in the absence of turnip oil, a large piece of burnt lard stuck to the bottom of the pot remained.</t80>
<t81>When the Gypsies returned, Ursula had worked on the entire village and turned them against them.</t81> <t82>But this time, when the Gypsies announced with a cacophony of every imaginable instrument and a town crier that they would be showcasing Naciancenes' legendary invention, curiosity overcame fear.</t82> <t83>Everyone crowded into the tent, paid a coin, and began to watch Melquiades, who had pulled himself together, with a wrinkle-free face, teeth shining like pearls, fresh as ever.</t83> <t84>Those who remembered his scurvy-ridden gums, sagging cheeks, and shriveled lips shuddered with fear at this latest proof of the Gypsy's supernatural power.</t84>
<t85>When Melquiades, after briefly removing his complete set of teeth along with his gums and showing them to those present, and then in that brief moment becoming the familiar trembling old man again, put his teeth back in place and smiled with the full vigor of his revived youth, fear turned into panic.</t85><t86>Even Jose Arcadio Buendia believed that Melquiades' wisdom had reached unimaginable levels, but when the gypsy explained the true nature of the dentures to him in private, he became overexcited.</t86><t87>This matter seemed both so simple and so extraordinary that Jose Arcadio Buendia instantly lost interest in his alchemy experiments.</t87><t88>He was again overwhelmed by a sense of suffocation.</t88><t89>He wasn't eating properly and was wandering around the house incessantly.</t89><t90>There are unimaginable things happening in this world, he said to Ursula.</t90><t91>While all sorts of magical tools and equipment are just across the river, here we are, wallowing in our ignorance.</t91><t92>Those who had known him since the days Macondo was founded were astonished at how much he had changed under Melquiades' influence.</t92>
<t93>In the past, Jose Arcadio Buendia was like a late tribal chief who taught how to plant crops, how to plant trees, how to raise children and animals, and who helped everyone with every task for the order and harmony of the community.</t93> <t94>From the very beginning, because his house was the best in the village, others took it as an example.</t94> <t95>It had a small but bright living room, a dining room decorated with colorful flowers like a terrace, two bedrooms, a courtyard where a grand chestnut tree spread its branches, a well-kept garden, and a pen where goats, pigs, and chickens lived together in peace.</t95> <t96>The only animal forbidden to be kept not only in his house but throughout the village was the fighting rooster.</t96>
<t97>Ursula was no less skillful than her husband.</t97> <t98>This petite, hardworking, serious woman with steady nerves, who had never been heard singing even once in her life, would rush around from dawn till midnight, dragging the rustle of her starched petticoats behind her.</t98> <t99>The compacted earth floor, the unplastered adobe walls, the rough wooden furniture they made with their own hands, were always spotless thanks to her, and the old chest where they stored their clothes smelled wonderfully of basil.</t99>
<t100>Jose Arcadio Buendia, the most enterprising person the village had ever seen, had planned the placement of the houses so meticulously that no one had to exert more effort than anyone else to fetch water from the river.</t100> <t101>He had aligned the streets with such prudence that when the midday heat struck, no house was more exposed to the sun than the others.</t101> <t102>Within a few years, Macondo had become a village of three hundred people, more orderly and industrious than anything they had ever seen or heard of before.</t102> <t103>This was a truly happy village where no one lived past thirty and no one ever died.</t103>
<t104>Since the day the village was founded, Jose Arcadio Buendia made traps and cages.</t104> <t105>In a short time, he filled not only his own house but the entire village with canaries, hummingbirds, and nightingales.</t105> <t106>The chirping of so many different birds together became so irritating that Ursula started plugging her ears with wax to avoid going mad.</t106> <t107>When Melquiades' tribe first arrived, selling crystal balls for headaches, everyone was surprised at how they found this village lost in the swamp's lethargy, and the gypsies explained that they found the village by following the bird sounds.</t107>
<t108>This spirit of social enterprise soon faded in the face of magnets, astronomical calculations, dreams of transforming objects, and the urge to discover the wonders of the world.</t108> <t109>Jose Arcadio Buendia ceased to be that clean, elegant, hardworking man and became a sluggish, shabby figure with a beard that Ursula could barely trim with her vegetable knife, mingling with his hair.</t109> <t110>According to many, he had fallen victim to an unknown spell.</t110> <t111>But when he took out his tools to dig and called upon those gathered around him to open a path that would connect Macondo to great discoveries, even those who most believed in his madness left their homes and work to follow him.</t111>
<t112>Jose Arcadio Buendia was completely ignorant about the geography of the region.</t112> <t113>All he knew was that there were impassable mountain ranges to the east, and beyond the mountains - according to what his grandfather, the first Aureliano Buendia, had told him - lay the old city of Riohacha, where Sir Francis Drake had hunted crocodiles with a cannon and stuffed the ones he shot to send to Queen Elizabeth.</t113> <t114>In his youth, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his men, along with their children, animals, and all sorts of household items, had crossed these mountains to find a way out to the sea, and after twenty-six months, they had founded Macondo to avoid turning back from the expedition.</t114> <t115>This path did not interest Jose Arcadio Buendia at all, as it would only lead to the past.</t115>
<t116>In the south stretched swamps covered with endless vegetation; according to the gypsies, this vast swamp world had no end.</t116> <t117>The great swamp to the west merged into the boundless waters where soft-skinned, mammalian sea creatures, whose heads and bodies resembled women, and whose extraordinarily beautiful breasts lured sailors to their doom, roamed freely.</t117> <t118>The gypsies would sail on these waters for six months until they reached the path where the postal mules passed.</t118> <t119>According to Jose Arcadio's calculations, the only possibility of establishing a connection with civilization was the road to the north.</t119> <t120>Once he was convinced of this, he distributed the tools for clearing the way and hunting weapons to the people who had worked shoulder to shoulder with him while founding Macondo.</t120> <t121>He threw the navigation instruments and maps into his backpack and embarked on that dangerous adventure.</t121>
<t122>In the early days, they did not encounter any significant obstacles.</t122> <t123>They advanced along the rocky bed of the river to the place where they had found the soldier's armor years ago, then veered into the forest and took a path winding through wild orange trees.</t123> <t124>At the end of the first week, they shot and roasted a deer, but after eating only half of it, they agreed to salt the rest and save it for the coming days.</t124> <t125>By taking this precaution, they tried to delay, even if just a little, the necessity of eating the large parrots with bluish flesh that made one's mouth pucker.</t125> <t126>Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun.</t126> <t127>The ground became soft and mushy like volcanic ash, the plants grew denser and denser, the cries of birds and the clamor of monkeys gradually faded away, and the world was enveloped in endless sorrow.</t127> <t128>As the members of the exploration party stepped into the steaming pools of oil with their boots, and as their machetes slashed through blood-red lilies and golden salamanders, they were overwhelmed by memories that went back even further than Adam's sin in this damp and silent paradise.</t128>
<t129>For a week, they walked almost without speaking, like sleepwalkers in this gloomy universe illuminated only by the faint glow of fireflies, and their lungs filled with the suffocating smell of blood.</t129> <t130>As they walked and cleared a path, it would be covered again by new plants that sprang up in the blink of an eye, so they couldn't turn back.</t130> <t131>Jose Arcadio Buendia said, "No matter, the important thing is not to lose our direction."</t131> <t132>By following the direction of his compass, he was leading his men towards the elusive north to get them out of this enchanted region as soon as possible.</t132> <t133>It was a starless, pitch-dark night, but the darkness was pregnant with clean, clear air.</t133> <t134>The men, exhausted from the long march, set up their hammocks and for the first time in two weeks, fell into a deep sleep.</t134> <t135>When they woke up after the sun had risen high, they were struck dumb by the enchanting sight that met their eyes.</t135>
<t136>In the distance, among the ferns and palm trees, stood a large Spanish galleon that looked as if it could turn completely white and disintegrate into dust in the silent morning light.</t136> <t137>From the perfectly intact masts of the galleon, which was slightly tilted to the starboard side, hung tattered sails adorned with crests featuring orchids in the center.</t137> <t138>The hull, covered with a shield of petrified barnacles and soft algae, was firmly attached to the rocks.</t138> <t139>The large vessel seemed to exist within a unique space created by loneliness and neglect, protected from the ravages of time and bird droppings.</t139> <t140>In the interior section, carefully explored and examined by the scouting party, there was nothing but a dense forest of flowers.</t140>
<t141>The discovery of the galleon, which was proof of the proximity of the sea, shattered all of Jose Arcadio Buendia's enthusiasm.</t141> <t142>He interpreted the sudden appearance of the sea, which he had sought in vain at great cost and sacrifice, as an insurmountable obstacle in his path, a twist of cruel fate.</t142> <t143>Years later, when Colonel Aureliano Buendia passed through this area again, now a regular postal route, he found the charred skeleton of the boat in the middle of a poppy field.</t143>
<t144>Only when he was convinced that this story was not his father's fabrication did he wonder how the galleon had come so far inland.</t144> <t145>However, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not bother himself with this question when he found the sea four days' journey from the galleon.</t145> <t146>When that ashen, foamy, filthy sea, which was not worth the dangers and sacrifices of the adventure, lay before him, his dreams were shattered.</t146>
<t147>"Damn it!" he shouted, "Macondo is surrounded by the sea."</t147>
<t148>The view that Macondo was a peninsula, based on the haphazard map drawn by Jose Arcadio Buendia upon his return from the expedition, remained valid for a long time.</t148> <t149>In a fit of anger, as if punishing himself for the lack of foresight he showed when choosing the village's location, Jose Arcadio Buendia exaggerated the transportation difficulties on the map.</t149> <t150>We can't go anywhere from here anymore, he lamented to Ursula.</t150> <t151>We will waste our lives here without benefiting from the blessings of science.</t151> <t152>After months of pondering in the small room he used as a laboratory, he came to this decision and became fixated on moving Macondo to a better place.</t152>
<t153>But this time, Ursula had anticipated his crazy intention in advance.</t153> <t154>With the invisible but unbeatable effort of a tiny ant, she twisted the ears of the village women and stood them all in front of their husbands, who were already ready to pack up and leave.</t154> <t155>Jose Arcadio Buendia never realized when and by which opposing forces the plan he had devised was woven into a web of excuses, disappointments, and dismissals until the plan eventually turned into a mere delusion.</t155> <t156>Ursula watched him with innocent attention, and one morning, while he was packing the laboratory equipment into boxes in the back room, she even pitied her husband when she heard him muttering about his moving plans to himself.</t156> <t157>She waited for Jose Arcadio Buendia to finish his work.</t157> <t158>She didn't say a word as he nailed the crates shut and wrote his initials on them with a brush dipped in ink.</t158> <t159>She had learned (from what he muttered to himself) that her husband knew the village men would not support him in this endeavor, but when Jose Arcadio Buendia attempted to remove the door of the room, Ursula found the courage to ask him what he was doing.</t159> <t160>Her husband replied in a hurt tone, Since no one wants to go, we will go on our own.</t160> <t161>Ursula remained completely unfazed.</t161>
<t162>"We are not going anywhere," he said.</t162> <t163>"We had children here, so we will stay here."</t163>
<t164>Jose Arcadio Buendia,</t164>
<t165>"But no one has died yet," he replied.</t165> <t166>If a person doesn't have their dead beneath the land they live on, that person is not of that land.</t166>
<t167>Ursula resisted with an unwavering determination:</t167>
<t168>If my death is necessary for you to stay here, then I will die.</t168>
<t169>Jose Arcadio Buendia never thought his wife had such willpower.</t169> <t170>With all his imagination, he tried to deceive his wife by talking about an astonishing world where, by sprinkling magical water on the ground, fruit trees would grow wherever you wanted, and every remedy for aches and pains was sold for next to nothing.</t170> <t171>But all these stories were of no use to Ursula.</t171>
<t172>"Instead of wasting time with your crazy inventions, think about your sons a little," he said.</t172> <t173>"Look at them, they are wandering around aimlessly like wild donkeys."</t173>
<t174>As soon as his wife said "look," Jose Arcadio Buendia looked out the window and saw the children walking barefoot in the sunny garden.</t174> <t175>It seemed to him as if Ursula had cast a spell and the children had suddenly appeared at that moment.</t175> <t176>That was when something inside him, something mysterious that tore him away from the present and took him to the unknown recesses of his memories, happened.</t176> <t177>While Ursula swept the house, now free from the danger of being abandoned for the rest of her life, Jose Arcadio Buendia stood by the window, his eyes fixed on the children.</t177> <t178>After a while, as he wiped his tearful eyes with the back of his hand, he sighed with a resigned attitude towards his fate.</t178>
<t179>-Okay, he said.</t179> <t180>Tell them to come and help me empty the chests.</t180>
<t181>Their eldest son, Jose Arcadio, was fourteen.</t181> <t182>He had a thick head, dense hair, and his temperament was like his father's.</t182> <t183>Like his father, he was large and strong, but it was evident from his infancy that he did not inherit his father's imagination.</t183> <t184>He was conceived and born during that arduous journey to cross the mountains before Macondo was founded, and his parents celebrated because he did not resemble the wild animals of the mountains.</t184> <t185>Aureliano, who held the distinction of being the first person born in Macondo, would turn six in March.</t185> <t186>He was a quiet, introverted child.</t186> <t187>He had cried while still in his mother's womb and was born with his eyes wide open.</t187> <t188>While they were cutting his umbilical cord, he examined the room with fearless curiosity, turning his head from side to side, scrutinizing the faces around him.</t188> <t189>Then, without paying attention to those who came to see him, he fixed his eyes on the ceiling covered with palm leaves that seemed about to collapse from the rain.</t189>
<t190>When Aureliano was three years old, Ursula did not recall the sharpness of that gaze until the moment he entered the kitchen just as his mother was about to take the boiling soup pot off the stove and place it on the table.</t190> <t191>The child stood at the door in astonishment and said, The soup will spill.</t191> <t192>The pot was standing firmly in the middle of the table, but before the child had even finished his sentence, it began to move toward the edge of the table as if driven by an impulse from within and fell to the ground, breaking.</t192> <t193>Terrified, Ursula told her husband what had happened, but Jose Arcadio Buendia took it in stride.</t193> <t194>He always did that; to him, their sons might as well not have existed.</t194> <t195>He did not care about the children, partly because he equated childhood with mental deficiency, and partly because his mind was always preoccupied with his own absurd, fanciful constructions.</t195>
<t196>From the day she called the children to help her unpack the laboratory tools from the crates, she dedicated her life to them.</t196> <t197>In that small back room, which was increasingly filled with strange maps and exaggerated drawings, she taught the children to read and write, to add and subtract, not only to the extent of her knowledge but also by pushing the boundaries of her imagination, she told them about the wonders of the world.</t197> <t198>This is how the children learned that at the southern tip of Africa, there lived people so wise and serene that they did nothing but sit and think in their spare time, and that it was possible to cross the Aegean Sea on foot by hopping from island to island all the way to the port of Thessaloniki.</t198> <t199>These mind-bending lessons were so deeply ingrained in the children's memories that, years later, just a second before giving the order to fire to the execution squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia recalled that hot March day, when his father interrupted his physics lesson, raised his hands in the air, stood as if mesmerized without blinking, and listened to the sounds of trumpets, drums, tambourines, and cymbals as the gypsies arrived in the village to announce the latest and most astonishing discovery of the sages of Memphis.</t199>
<t200>The newcomers were a new tribe made up of handsome young men and beautiful women who knew no language other than their own, had oily skin, and were quick with their hands. They had colorful painted parrots that sang Italian arias, chickens that laid a hundred golden eggs while keeping pace with the tambourine's rhythm, trained monkeys that could read people's minds, versatile machines that could sew buttons while also putting out fires, devices that made people forget bad memories, poultices that healed the wounds of the past, and thousands of other extraordinary and unheard-of inventions, dances, and music that turned the streets into a carnival chaos, inspiring Jose Arcadio Buendia to invent a memory machine to keep track of it all.</t200> <t201>In the blink of an eye, they transformed the village into a completely different place.</t201> <t202>The Macondians, bewildered by the fair's crowd, began to lose their way in their own streets.</t202>
<t203>Jose Arcadio Buendia, in order not to lose them in this chaos, held one child's hand with one hand and the other child's hand with the other, bumping into gold-toothed acrobats and six-armed jugglers, feeling suffocated by the smell of manure and sandals rising from the crowd, he frantically ran from place to place to explain the endless mysteries of that incredible nightmare, searching for Melquiades.</t203> <t204>He asked a few gypsies who did not understand his language.</t204> <t205>Finally, when he reached the place where Melquiades always set up his tent, he encountered a tight-lipped Armenian who was hawking an elixir that made people invisible in Spanish.</t205> <t206>Jose Arcadio Buendia, elbowing his way through the crowd that was watching the man as if mesmerized, just as he was about to ask his question, the man gulped down the amber-colored object in one go.</t206> <t207>After the gypsy scrutinized Jose Arcadio Buendia from head to toe with his terrifying gaze, he suddenly transformed into a steaming, deadly pool of tar.</t207>
<t208>The answer Jose Arcadio Buendia received to his question echoed over the pitch deposit: Melquiades is dead.</t208> <t209>Jose Arcadio Buendia was stunned by the news, unable to collect himself until the crowd dispersed to see other wonders and the tight-lipped Armenian's deposit evaporated.</t209> <t210>Later, the other gypsies confirmed that Melquiades had died of fever in the port of Singapore and that his body was thrown into the deepest part of the Java Sea.</t210> <t211>The children paid no attention.</t211> <t212>They insisted on going to see the new discovery of the Memphis Sages, announced at the door of the tent said to belong to Sultan Suleiman.</t212> <t213>They insisted so much that finally Jose Arcadio Buendia paid thirty reals and let them into the tent.</t213> <t214>Inside the tent, a giant man with a body covered in hair, a shaved head, a copper ring in his nose, and a heavy iron chain on his foot was standing guard over a pirate chest.</t214>
<t215>When Dev opened the chest, a coolness spread through the air.</t215> <t216>Inside the chest, there was a large, transparent mass that, with its tiny needles, split the sunlight and turned it into colorful stars.</t216> <t217>Knowing that the children immediately expected an explanation from him, Jose Arcadio, flustered, mumbled something under his breath:</t217>
<t218>-This is the largest diamond in the world.</t218>
<t219>The Gypsy replied, No, they call this ice.</t219>
<t220>When Jose Arcadio Buendia reached out his hand towards the mold without understanding the explanation, the giant pushed him away.</t220> <t221>You'll have to pay five more reals to touch it, he said.</t221> <t222>Jose Arcadio Buendia gave the money and placed his hand on the ice, standing still for a few minutes, his heart filled with the fear and excitement of touching this mystery; Unable to decide what to say, he gave another ten reals so that his sons could also partake in this astonishing experience.</t222> <t223>Little Jose Arcadio did not want to touch the ice.</t223> <t224>As for Aureliano, he took a step forward and touched the ice with his hand, only to pull it back immediately.</t224> <t225>In astonishment, he exclaimed; It's burning hot like fire!</t225> <t226>His father forgot the disappointments of his mad experiments and the corpse of Melquiades, who had been fed to the squid.</t226> <t227>He paid another five reals and, pressing his hand on the block of ice as if swearing on a holy book, he shouted:</t227>
<t228>-Here it is, the greatest invention of our age.</t228>
<t229>When the pirate Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha in the sixteenth century, Ursula Iguaran's great-great-great-great-grandmother was so terrified by the alarm bells and cannon blasts that she lost control of her limbs and sat right on a burning stove.</t229> <t230>Because of those burns, she became a useless woman to her man for the rest of her life.</t230> <t231>She could only sit on one side with the support of pillows, and her walk must have been affected as well, for she never went out in public to walk again.</t231> <t232>She became so obsessed with the smell of burns emanating from her body that she stopped seeing anyone.</t232> <t233>She couldn't bear to sleep, fearing that the English and their ferocious dogs would burst through the bedroom window and brand her private parts with hot irons, so she would spend the nights in the courtyard.</t233> <t234>Her Aragonese merchant husband, the father of her two children, spent half of his fortune on medicine and entertainment to free her from this fear.</t234> <t235>In the end, he sold everything he had, took his family, and settled in a village at the foot of a mountain, far from the sea, where peaceful Indians lived, and he built his wife a windowless bedroom so that the pirates in her dreams couldn't find a way in.</t235>
<t236>In that remote village, the great-great-great-grandfather of Ursula, who partnered with a local tobacco grower named Don Jose Arcadio Buendia, made a great fortune from this profitable business in just a few years.</t236> <t237>A few centuries later, the great-great-great-grandson of the local tobacco grower married the great-great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese merchant.</t237> <t238>That is why, whenever Ursula got fed up with her husband's crazy ideas, she would instantly transcend three centuries of fate and curse the day Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha.</t238> <t239>She did this somewhat to vent her feelings, because until their death, they were bound to each other by a bond stronger than love, a shared sense of guilt.</t239> <t240>They were cousins.</t240> <t241>They grew up together in that old village, which had become one of the most beautiful towns in the province thanks to the hard work and customs of their ancestors.</t241> <t242>Although it was clear they would marry from the moment they were born, their own relatives initially opposed this desire when they expressed their wish to marry.</t242> <t243>They feared that iguana-like lizards would be born from the healthy children of these two races that had intermarried and mingled for centuries.</t243>
<t244>Ursula's aunt had married an uncle of Jose Arcadio Buendia and gave birth to a boy who, because he was born with a tail that was furry like a tassel, curly like a corkscrew, and cartilaginous, could not loosen his belt for any woman until he was forty-two years old and had to wear loose pants for his entire life.</t244> <t245>This pig's tail, which no woman was allowed to see, became the man's doom when a butcher friend, as a favor, chopped it off with his cleaver.</t245> <t246>Jose Arcadio Buendia, with the stubbornness of being nineteen years old, solved the problem in one fell swoop: I don't care if my children are piglets, as long as they know how to speak.</t246> <t247>Thus, they got married with a wedding that lasted three days and three nights, with fireworks and brass band music.</t247> <t248>They would have been quite happy if Ursula's mother hadn't scared her daughter by saying she would give birth to children with pig tails, and even advised her not to share her husband's bed.</t248> <t249>Fearing that her large, uncomprehending husband might violate her in his sleep, Ursula began to wear a primitive chastity belt made of sailcloth, tightened with crisscrossed leather straps, and fastened with a large iron buckle in the front.</t249> <t250>They lived like this for a few months.</t250>
<t251>During the day, Jose Arcadio Buendia was busy with fighting cocks, while Ursula was working on embroidery beside her mother.</t251> <t252>At night, instead of making love, they would wrestle fiercely for hours.</t252> <t253>Over time, the people around them sensed something was amiss, and despite being married for a year, rumors spread that Ursula was still a virgin because her husband was impotent.</t253> <t254>This rumor eventually reached the ears of Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t254>
<t255>With an extremely calm demeanor, he said to his wife, "Look, what will people say."</t255>
<t256>Ursula replied, "Let them say whatever they want, we know it's not like that."</t256>
<t257>This situation continued like this for another six months until that tremendous Sunday when Jose Arcadio Buendia defeated Prudencio Aguilar in a cockfight.</t257> <t258>Seeing his rooster covered in blood, Prudencio Aguilar, driven mad with rage, moved quite a distance away from Jose Arcadio Buendia so that everyone in the fighting area could hear:</t258>
<t259>"Good news!" he shouted, "Maybe the Rooster will do your wife a favor too."</t259>
<t260>Jose Arcadio Buendia, without batting an eye, took his rooster.</t260> <t261>To those present, he said, "I'll be right back," and then turned to Prudencio Aguilar:</t261>
<t262>-Go home and get a gun, I will kill you.</t262>
<t263>He returned ten minutes later with the spear inherited from his grandfather, its tip notched.</t263> <t264>Prudencio Aguilar was waiting for him at the entrance of the cockfighting ring, where more than half the village had gathered.</t264> <t265>He didn't have a chance to defend himself.</t265> <t266>The spear, hurled by Jose Arcadio Buendia with the strength of a bull and the sharpshooting precision of the first Aureliano Buendia, who had wiped out the local tigers, pierced his throat.</t266> <t267>That night, while everyone kept vigil over the dead man at the fighting ring, Jose Arcadio Buendia burst into the bedroom just as his wife was about to put on her chastity belt.</t267> <t268>Pointing his spear, he commanded, Take it off.</t268> <t269>Ursula understood her husband's intention.</t269> <t270>You'll be responsible for what happens to us, she murmured.</t270> <t271>Jose Arcadio Buendia thrust his spear into the earthen floor.</t271>
<t272>"If you give birth to a monstrous freak, we will also raise monstrous freaks," he said.</t272> <t273>"But from now on, no one will be killed in this village because of you."</t273>
<t274>It was a warm, moonlit, beautiful June night.</t274> <t275>Prudencio Aguilar's relatives, indifferent to the breeze filled with tears, stayed awake and frolicked in bed until morning.</t275>
<t276>The incident was covered up as an honor duel, but both of them were left with a guilty conscience.</t276> <t277>One night, Ursula, who couldn't sleep, went out to the courtyard to get some water and saw Prudencio Aguilar next to the water jug.</t277> <t278>The man was blue-black, with a sorrowful expression on his face, trying to plug the hole in his throat with alpha grass.</t278> <t279>Ursula wasn't scared; she felt pity.</t279>
<t280>She went to the room and told her husband what she had seen, but her husband didn't dwell on it much.</t280> <t281>He dismissed it, saying, "I guess we can't bear the pangs of conscience."</t281> <t282>Two nights later, Ursula saw Prudencio Aguilar again, this time in the bathroom, cleaning the dried blood from his throat with alpha grass.</t282> <t283>Another night, she saw him wandering in the rain.</t283> <t284>Jose Arcadio Buendia, upset by these visions his wife was seeing, grabbed the spear and rushed into the garden.</t284> <t285>The dead man stood before him with that sorrowful look.</t285>
<t286>Jose Arcadio Buendia shouted, "Go to hell!"</t286> <t287>"If you come back again, I'll kill you once more."</t287>
<t288>Prudencio Aguilar did not leave, and Jose Arcadio Buendia did not dare to swing the spear.</t288> <t289>After that night, he never had a good night's sleep again.</t289> <t290>The great loneliness of the dead man standing in the rain, his deep longing for the living, his haste to find water in the house to wet the plug of alfa grass and clean his wound, weighed heavily on Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t290> <t291>He must be suffering a lot, he said to Ursula.</t291> <t292>It's clear that he's heartbroken from loneliness.</t292> <t293>This touched Ursula so much that the next time she found the dead man checking the pots over the stove, she understood what he was looking for and started leaving jugs of water in every corner of the house.</t293> <t294>One night, when Jose Arcadio Buendia found him washing his wound in his own room, he lost his patience.</t294>
<t295>"Alright Prudencio," he said.</t295> <t296>"We will take our leave and go as far away from this village as possible."</t296> <t297>"You can rest easy now."</t297>
<t298>This is how they embarked on the journey to cross the mountains.</t298> <t299>A few friends of Jose Arcadio Buendia, who were as young as he was, dismantled their homes and gathered their belongings in the excitement of the adventure. They set out towards lands that no one had promised them, taking their wives and children along.</t299>
<t300>Jose Arcadio Buendia, before setting out, buried his spear in the yard, thinking that perhaps this way he could give Prudencio Aguilar some peace in his grave, and he slaughtered his unique fighting cocks one by one.</t300> <t301>Ursula took nothing with her except a few pieces of kitchenware from her dowry chest and the small box containing the gold inherited from her father.</t301> <t302>They had not charted a definite course for themselves.</t302> <t303>They would walk in the exact opposite direction of the road to Riohacha, simply to leave no trace behind and avoid encountering acquaintances.</t303>
<t304>It was a foolish journey.</t304> <t305>Fourteen months later, Ursula, whose stomach was ruined by monkey meat and snake stew, gave birth to a boy who looked entirely human.</t305> <t306>Because her legs were swollen like logs and her varicose veins bulged like fingers due to the pregnancy, she spent half the journey in a hammock carried by two men.</t306> <t307>The children, who looked pitiful with their sunken bellies and lifeless eyes, still endured the journey better than their parents, seeing it as a kind of game.</t307> <t308>After nearly two years of trekking through mountains and valleys, one morning they earned the distinction of being the first mortals to see the western slopes of the mountain range.</t308> <t309>From the cloud-shrouded peak, they saw the vast swamp spreading out like a giant puddle towards the end of the world.</t309> <t310>But they never found the sea.</t310> <t311>After losing their way in the swamp and wandering for several months, one night they camped by a pebbly river that flowed like a frozen stream of glass, far from the last Indians they had encountered on the road.</t311>
<t312>Years later, during the second civil war, Colonel Aureliano Buendia tried the same route to raid Riohacha, but after six days of travel, he realized it was madness.</t312> <t313>Even so, that night when they camped by the river, his father's caravan looked like shipwreck survivors, but instead of dwindling during the journey, they had multiplied and were all determined to stake their claim in the world (and indeed they did).</t313> <t314>That very night, Jose Arcadio Buendia dreamed of a bustling, noisy city with walls made of mirrors rising up from where they camped.</t314> <t315>When he asked what this place was called, they told him a name he had never heard before, which had no meaning, but created a supernatural echo in his dream: Macondo.</t315> <t316>The next day, Jose Arcadio Buendia convinced his men that they would never find the sea.</t316> <t317>He told them to cut down the trees and clear a spot in the coolest part of the shore, right by the river, and that is where they founded the village.</t317>
<t318>Jose Arcadio Buendia could never interpret the dream of houses with mirror walls until the day he discovered ice.</t318><t319>When he saw the ice, he thought he had grasped the deep meaning of the dream.</t319><t320>He thought that in the near future, they could produce large blocks of ice from an ordinary substance like water and build the new houses of the village with them.</t320><t321>Macondo would no longer be a place like an oven where hinges and door knockers bent from the heat, but would turn into a city as cold as winter.</t321><t322>If he did not insist on establishing an ice factory, the only reason was that he had devoted himself to the education of his sons, especially Aureliano, who showed a peculiar talent in alchemy at that time.</t322><t323>The laboratory was cleaned and became spotless.</t323><t324>Father and son, without getting carried away by a flood of new discoveries, calmly reviewed Melquiades' notes and, with long and patient effort, tried to separate Ursula's gold from the bottom of the pot where it had burned and stuck.</t324><t325>Young Jose Arcadio did not participate much in this work.</t325><t326>While his father was engrossed in the stills, the stubborn eldest son, who had always looked older than his age, grew into a big, burly young man.</t326><t327>His voice changed.</t327><t328>He started to grow a mustache.</t328>
<t329>One night, when Ursula entered the room where the boy was undressing, she was overcome with a mixture of shame and pity: He was the first naked man she had seen since her husband, and his equipment was so developed that it almost had an abnormal appearance.</t329> <t330>Pregnant with her third child, Ursula felt the same terror she had felt on her wedding night.</t330>
<t331>At that time, a cheerful, coquettish, foul-mouthed woman who also knew how to read fortunes used to come and go as a daily worker.</t331><t332>Ursula confided her son's condition to her.</t332><t333>She thought that such a disproportionately large tool was as abnormal as her nephew's pig's tail.</t333><t334>When the woman heard this, she burst into laughter that scattered in all directions like broken glass.</t334><t335>On the contrary, she said, The boy will be lucky.</t335><t336>To confirm her prophecy, a few days later she brought the cards and locked herself in the pantry behind the kitchen with Jose Arcadio.</t336><t337>She calmly spread the cards on the carpenter's bench, and while the boy stood beside her more out of boredom than curiosity, she said whatever came to her mind.</t337><t338>Then suddenly she reached out and touched the boy.</t338><t339>She must have been truly astonished, as nothing but "Oh my God" came out of her mouth.</t339><t340>Jose Arcadio felt his marrow froth and swell.</t340><t341>He felt a vague sense of dread and was overcome with the urge to cry his heart out.</t341>
<t342>The woman did not make any insinuations.</t342> <t343>But Jose Arcadio spent the whole night searching for the woman, for the scent that rose from her armpits and seeped into his own skin.</t343> <t344>He wanted the woman to always be by his side, to mother him, to never leave the pantry, and for her to always say "Oh my God."</t344> <t345>One day, unable to bear it any longer, he went to the woman's house.</t345> <t346>He sat in the living room without saying a word, staring blankly, making a formal visit.</t346> <t347>At that moment, he did not desire the woman at all.</t347> <t348>He found the woman completely different, as if she were someone else entirely, with no relation to the fantasy created by her scent.</t348> <t349>Jose Arcadio drank his coffee and left the house in distress.</t349> <t350>That night, during the terrible hours when he couldn't sleep, he desired the woman again with a wild longing, but this time he wanted her not as she was in the pantry, but as she was that day.</t350>
<t351>Days later, the woman unexpectedly called him to the house where she lived with her mother and took the boy to the bedroom under the pretext of showing him the playing cards.</t351> <t352>Then she touched the boy so recklessly that after the initial shiver passed, the young man felt disappointed; what he felt was more fear than pleasure.</t352> <t353>The woman told him to come and see her that night.</t353> <t354>He, knowing that he had no strength left in his knees, said okay, thinking he should get away as soon as possible.</t354> <t355>But that night, as he tossed and turned in his bed burning with fever, he realized that even if he couldn't manage it, he still couldn't help but go to the woman.</t355> <t356>In the dark, listening to his brother's calm breathing, his father's dry cough in the adjacent room, the chickens' clucking in the courtyard, the mosquitoes' buzzing, the pounding of his heart, and the rush of a world he had never noticed before, he dressed by feel and threw himself into the sleeping street.</t356> <t357>Inwardly, he wished that, as the woman had said, the door would not only be unlocked but also barred with an iron rod.</t357>
<t358>But the door was open.</t358> <t359>He pushed the door with the tip of his finger, the sad and distinct creak released by the hinges sent icy echoes through the young man's insides.</t359> <t360>As he tried not to make a sound and slipped sideways to step inside, that smell hit his nose.</t360> <t361>He was still standing in the hall where the woman's three brothers had set up hammocks and were lying down.</t361> <t362>In the dark, he couldn't make out the positions of the hammocks, and to avoid mistaking one bed for another, he was feeling his way to the bedroom door.</t362> <t363>He found the door.</t363> <t364>But he stumbled over the hammock ropes, which were lower than he had thought, and the man who had been snoring until that moment turned over in his sleep and mumbled, It's Wednesday.</t364>
<t365>Jose Arcadio, while pushing the bedroom door, couldn't prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor.</t365> <t366>In the pitch darkness, he suddenly realized that he had completely lost his way.</t366> <t367>In the tiny room lay the woman's mother, sister, sister's husband with their two children, and the woman herself, but perhaps she wasn't in that room.</t367> <t368>If the scent hadn't permeated every corner of the house, he could have found his way by it, but the woman's scent had, just as it had seeped into his own skin, penetrated every nook and cranny of the house with its full intensity.</t368> <t369>As Jose Arcadio stood still, pondering how he had found himself in such an empty state and let himself go, a hand feeling the darkness with fingers spread wide touched his face.</t369> <t370>Jose Arcadio wasn't surprised, because deep down he had been expecting it.</t370>
<t371>He let himself go into that hand and did not object to being dragged to a place whose whereabouts were unknown.</t371> <t372>Then his clothes were stripped off, and in that bottomless darkness where his arms couldn't reach anything to hold onto, he was tossed from side to side like a sack of potatoes.</t372> <t373>It didn't smell like a woman here, it smelled like ammonia, and the more he tried to picture the woman's face, Ursula's face loomed before him.</t373> <t374>He vaguely realized that he was doing something he had wanted to do for a long time but never really thought could be done, yet he didn't know what he was doing, because he couldn't tell where his feet were, where his head was, whose feet and whose head they were, and he could no longer endure the rumbling rising from his kidneys as if glaciers were collapsing, the gas in his intestines, the fear, the maddening silence, and the terrifying loneliness, wanting both to escape and to stay there forever.</t374>
<t375>The woman's name was Pilar Ternera.</t375> <t376>Her family had dragged her along on the expedition that resulted in the founding of Macondo, to separate her from the man who had deflowered her at fourteen and used her until she was twenty-two, but who, being a scoundrel, refused to marry her.</t376> <t377>The man promised to follow her to the ends of the earth, but later, after he had settled his affairs.</t377> <t378>The girl had grown tired of waiting, interpreting every man who appeared in the cards—whether he would come in three days, three months, or three years, whether by land or by sea—as the one who would come for her.</t378> <t379>Waiting had taken away the firmness of her hips, the perkiness of her breasts, and her affection, but her wild heart remained the same.</t379> <t380>Jose Arcadio, madly in love with that enormous toy, would dive into the labyrinth of the room after her every night.</t380> <t381>One time, he found the door bolted and, knowing that once he started he would see it through to the end, he knocked on the door several times.</t381> <t382>After what seemed like an endless wait, the woman opened the door.</t382>
<t383>During the day, he would lie down and drift into dreams, secretly savoring the memories of the previous night.</t383> <t384>But when the woman, with her cheerful, carefree, and talkative demeanor, came home, Jose Arcadio no longer needed to hide his excitement, because this woman, whose tinkling laughter scared the pigeons, had no connection whatsoever with that invisible force that taught him to hold his breath, control his heartbeat, and understand why men fear death.</t384> <t385>Jose Arcadio had become so withdrawn that when his father and brother caused a commotion with the news that they had separated Ursula's gold from the mining debris, he couldn't even understand why the household was so happy.</t385>
<t386>The father and son had really succeeded in this task after days of hard work and effort.</t386> <t387>Ursula was overjoyed and even thanked God for the invention of alchemy.</t387> <t388>Meanwhile, the villagers were flocking to the laboratory.</t388> <t389>They were offering biscuits spread with guava jam to those who came to celebrate this miracle.</t389> <t390>Jose Arcadio Buendia was proudly showing the villagers the recovered gold in the crucible as if he had invented it himself.</t390> <t391>After showing it to everyone, he stood in front of his eldest son, who hadn't been near the laboratory for a few days.</t391> <t392>Pressing the dry and yellowish lump to the boy's nose, he asked, "What do you think this looks like?"</t392> <t393>Jose Arcadio responded as he felt:</t393>
<t394>To the dog poop.</t394>
<t395>His father slapped him so hard with the back of his hand that blood and tears mingled on the boy's face.</t395> <t396>That night, Pilar Ternera found the bottle and cotton in the dark by feel and treated the boy's swollen face with mountain tobacco, then she fulfilled her own desires by trying to love him without causing him pain.</t396> <t397>They became so intimate that after a while they began to whisper to each other without realizing it.</t397>
<t398>"I want to be alone with you," said the young man, "I will tell everyone openly, so we can stop meeting in secret."</t398>
<t399>The woman did not attempt to soothe him.</t399>
<t400>"That would be great," he said.</t400> <t401>"If we are alone, we can light the lamp, gaze at each other to our heart's content, shout out whatever comes to mind without fear of being heard, and you can whisper naughty things in my ear."</t401>
<t402>This conversation, the gnawing grudge he harbored towards his father, and the possibility of wild lovemaking, gave the young man such courage that words cannot describe.</t402> <t403>Without feeling the need for a preliminary explanation, he told his brother everything that had happened.</t403>
<t404>At first, Aureliano could only grasp the great danger that could arise from his brother's adventure, he never understood the appealing side of it.</t404> <t405>As time went by, a worry started to consume the child.</t405> <t406>He was contemplating the ins and outs of the danger in his mind, experiencing his brother's pain and pleasure himself, sharing his brother's fear and happiness.</t406> <t407>Like lying on a bed of embers, he stayed awake until dawn, waiting for his brother.</t407>
<t408>After he arrived, they would talk until it was time to get up.</t408> <t409>So much so that, before long, both of them, in the drowsiness brought on by sleeplessness, neglected both alchemy and their father's wisdom, and started hiding in every nook and cranny.</t409> <t410>These boys have gone mad, said Ursula, there's definitely a worm in them.</t410> <t411>She crushed some goosefoot herb and made a nauseating medicine.</t411> <t412>The boys, with an unexpected indifference, drank the medicine without a sound and, after making eleven trips to the toilet in one day and expelling rose-colored parasites, they convinced Ursula that their drowsiness and distraction were due to these worms, and celebrated by showing them to everyone they met.</t412> <t413>Meanwhile, Aureliano not only understood his brother's experience but lived it as if it had happened to him.</t413> <t414>Once, while his brother was describing the intricacies of love games in great detail, Aureliano interrupted him and asked, What is it like?</t414> <t415>Jose Arcadio responded without hesitation:</t415>
<t416>-Just like an earthquake.</t416>
<t417>Amaranta was born at two o'clock in the morning on a Thursday in January.</t417> <t418>Before anyone entered the room, Ursula examined the girl all over.</t418> <t419>Although the child was pale-skinned and slippery like a salamander, she looked human in every way.</t419> <t420>Until the house was filled to the brim with neighbors, Aureliano didn't even notice the new baby.</t420> <t421>Then, taking advantage of the commotion, he went out; he set out to find his brother, who had been missing from his bed since eleven o'clock at night.</t421> <t422>Without even stopping to think about how he would pull him out of Pilar Ternera's bedroom, he went to the woman's house, determined.</t422> <t423>He wandered around the house for hours, whistling coded signals, and when dawn broke, he had no choice but to return home.</t423> <t424>When he entered his mother's room, what did he see but Jose Arcadio, with innocence written all over his face, playing with his newborn sister.</t424>
<t425>The Gypsies had just returned when Ursula's mourning period had just ended.</t425> <t426>These were the same acrobats and jugglers who had brought the ice last time.</t426> <t427>It soon became clear that, unlike Melquiades' tribe, they were not harbingers of developments and innovations but rather purveyors of entertainment.</t427>
<t428>Even when they brought ice, instead of talking about the benefits it would bring to human life, they advertised it as if it were a circus trick.</t428> <t429>This time, along with a thousand and one tricks, they brought a flying carpet.</t429> <t430>But they presented it not as a fundamental contribution to the development of transportation, but as an entertainment device.</t430> <t431>The people dug up their last gold coins from the ground just to take a quick flight over the village.</t431> <t432>Taking advantage of the chaos that everyone was participating in, Jose Arcadio and Pilar mingled with the crowd and had fun for hours.</t432> <t433>Among all those people, they were two newly in love, flying with happiness, and they almost believed that love was a much deeper and more comforting feeling than the ecstatic but fleeting happiness of the nights they secretly met.</t433> <t434>However, Pilar broke the spell.</t434> <t435>Jose Arcadio, caught up in the joy of being with her, forgot the time and place and brought the world crashing down on the boy's head.</t435> <t436>She said, "Now you have truly become a man."</t436> <t437>When the young man couldn't understand what she meant, she said it plainly:</t437>
<t438>-You're going to be a father.</t438>
<t439>Jose Arcadio couldn't step out of the house for a few days.</t439> <t440>As soon as he heard Pilar's cheerful laughter from the kitchen, he would take refuge in the laboratory where, with Ursula's permission, the alchemy experiments had regained momentum.</t440> <t441>Jose Arcadio Buendia welcomed his wayward son with joy and included him in the alchemical stone research he had finally decided to undertake.</t441> <t442>One evening, when a gypsy, who had seated the village children waving happily behind him, flew the carpet past the laboratory window, the boys' minds were captivated by the flying carpet, but Jose Arcadio Buendia didn't even turn his head to look.</t442> <t443>Let them think they are flying, he said.</t443> <t444>We will fly better than them, and not with a tattered blanket, but with scientific tools.</t444> <t445>Although Jose Arcadio seemed interested, he couldn't fathom the mystery of the alchemist's egg, which resembled a clumsily blown, crooked bottle.</t445> <t446>He couldn't rid himself of his worries.</t446> <t447>He stopped eating and drinking, and couldn't sleep.</t447>
<t448>Just as his father would become sullen when his experiments failed, Jose Arcadio's face would also fall into a thousand pieces, so much so that Jose Arcadio</t448> <t449>Buendia thought the boy was too obsessed with this alchemy business and removed him from his duties in the laboratory.</t449> <t450>Aureliano knew that his brother's problem did not stem from searching for the philosopher's stone, but he couldn't get a word out of him.</t450> <t451>Jose Arcadio's former sincerity was gone; he had ceased to be someone who shared his secrets and talked, becoming instead a withdrawn, rude person.</t451> <t452>He harbored a bitter resentment against the whole world and avoided everyone.</t452>
<t453>One night, as usual, he slipped out of bed, but instead of going to Pilar Ternera's house, he mingled with the noisy crowd of the fair.</t453> <t454>Among the myriad of shows, after wandering without turning his head to any of them, something unrelated to the exhibited skills caught his eye: It was a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, whose neck was weighed down by the beads she wore, and she was the most beautiful woman Jose Arcadio had ever seen in his life.</t454> <t455>The girl was standing among the crowd watching the tragic adventure of the man who turned into a snake for not obeying his parents.</t455>
<t456>Jose Arcadio showed no interest in the performance.</t456> <t457>While the pitiful interrogation of the snake man continued, he pushed through the crowd to the front row where the girl was standing, walked up, and stood right behind her.</t457> <t458>He pressed closely against the girl's back.</t458> <t459>When the girl tried to pull away, Jose Arcadio leaned in even more.</t459> <t460>It was then that the girl felt him completely.</t460> <t461>Unable to believe this was real, she leaned against the young man in shock and fear without moving, and finally, unable to resist, she turned her head and gave a timid smile.</t461>
<t462>At that moment, two gypsies locked the snake man in his cage and took him to the tent.</t462> <t463>The gypsy running the show addressed the audience: Ladies and gentlemen, now we will show you the chilling ordeal of the woman who, as punishment for seeing something she shouldn't have, is beheaded every night at this exact hour for the past one hundred and fifty years.</t463> <t464>Jose Arcadio and the gypsy girl did not watch the beheading scene.</t464> <t465>They went to the girl's tent, and while undressing, they began to kiss each other with frantic passion.</t465> <t466>When the gypsy girl took off her starched lace corset, she was left completely naked.</t466> <t467>Her newly budding breasts and her spindly legs, which were not even as thick as Jose Arcadio's arms, made her resemble a frail frog, but she had a boldness and warmth that made one forget her frailty.</t467>
<t468>However, Jose Arcadio could not respond to the girl's advances, because the tent they entered was a busy place where the gypsies constantly came and went to take their circus equipment and do their work, and sometimes even stood by the bed to play dice.</t468> <t469>The lantern hanging from the central pole illuminated everything.</t469> <t470>When they paused their foreplay, as the girl, not knowing what to do, tried to arouse the completely naked Jose Arcadio lying on the bed, a gypsy woman with marvelous skin, followed by a man who was neither from the camp nor the villagers, entered the tent and started undressing by the bed.</t470>
<t471>At one point, the woman's eyes fell on Jose Arcadio, and she examined his fallen, beastly sign from head to toe with fiery excitement.</t471>
<t472>"Oh my boy," he exclaimed, "I hope you stay just the way you are."</t472>
<t473>The girl next to Jose Arcadio snapped, Leave us alone, and the newcomers knelt down on the floor beside the bed.</t473> <t474>Their passionate caressing also fueled Jose Arcadio's desire.</t474> <t475>At the first thrust, the girl's bones cracked as if a box of dominoes had scattered around, a light sweat broke out on her skin, a mournful moan and a faint smell of mud rose from her entire body as her eyes filled with tears.</t475>
<t476>But he endured this blow with an admirable will and bravery.</t476> <t477>Arcadio felt as if he were ascending to the realm of angels, and the love-filled, explicit words that overflowed from his heart entered the girl's ears and began to spill from her mouth in the gypsy language.</t477> <t478>It was a Thursday.</t478> <t479>On Saturday night, Jose Arcadio wrapped a red scarf around his head and left with the gypsies.</t479>
<t480>Ursula, upon realizing that he had disappeared, turned the village upside down.</t480> <t481>At the place where the tribe had camped, there was nothing but a trash can among the extinguished fires that were still smoldering.</t481> <t482>Someone searching for trinkets among the debris told Ursula that they had seen her son the night before, being taken away in a wheelbarrow with the snake man's cage in the middle of the gypsy caravan.</t482>
<t483>To her husband, who didn't care in the slightest about the boy's disappearance;</t483>
<t484>"The boy has turned into a gypsy!" Ursula exclaimed.</t484>
<t485>After being beaten a thousand times and reheated a thousand times, Jose Arcadio Buendia, who was pounding the mortar in the mortar, said, "I wish it were so. He would learn to be a man that way."</t485>
<t486>Ursula asked around to find out where the gypsies had gone.</t486><t487>With the hope of catching up to them, she set off on the indicated path and began walking, asking as she went.</t487><t488>She got farther and farther from the village, and eventually, thinking she had completely lost touch with the village, she dismissed the idea of returning.</t488><t489>At eight in the evening, after burying the prepared materials in warm manure to prevent them from freezing, Jose Arcadio Buendia entered the house, curious about what had happened to Amaranta, who had turned purple from crying, and noticed that Ursula was nowhere to be seen.</t489><t490>Within a few hours, he gathered a fully armed group, entrusted Amaranta to a woman who volunteered to nurse her, and set off on the invisible paths in search of Ursula.</t490><t491>Aureliano went with them.</t491><t492>Indian fishermen, whose language they did not understand, tried to explain through gestures that they had not seen anyone pass by.</t492><t493>After searching in vain for three days, they returned to the village.</t493>
<t494>Jose Arcadio Buendia agonized for weeks out of curiosity.</t494> <t495>He took care of Amaranta, washed and cleaned her, swaddled her, carried her to the wet nurse four times a day, and even sang lullabies at night that Ursula could never manage.</t495> <t496>At one point, Pilar Ternera volunteered to take care of the household chores until Ursula returned.</t496> <t497>Aureliano, whose instincts had become even sharper due to the disaster that had befallen them, immediately sensed upon seeing the woman that she was responsible for his brother's escape and his mother's subsequent disappearance. He greeted the suggestion so silently and sullenly that the woman never set foot in the house again.</t497>
<t498>Time set everything right.</t498> <t499>Jose Arcadio Buendia and his son found themselves at work without even realizing when they had returned to the laboratory, dusted off the place, set the still on the fire, and patiently started processing the materials that had been lying in manure for months.</t499> <t500>Even Amaranta, lying in her wicker basket, watched with curiosity as her father and brother worked diligently in the small room, which had become heavy with mercury vapors.</t500> <t501>Months after Ursula's departure, strange things began to happen.</t501> <t502>An empty bottle that had been forgotten in a corner of the cupboard for a long time suddenly became too heavy to lift.</t502> <t503>A pot of water on the workbench started boiling vigorously without any fire underneath it and continued to boil for half an hour until all the water had evaporated.</t503> <t504>Unable to explain these occurrences but attributing them to the maturation of the philosopher's stone, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his son watched what was happening with astonishment and excitement.</t504> <t505>One day, Amaranta's basket suddenly started moving, spinning around the room until Aureliano rushed in and caught it.</t505> <t506>But his father did not panic at all.</t506> <t507>Firmly believing that the miracle they had been waiting for was imminent, he put the basket back in its place and tied it securely to the leg of the table.</t507> <t508>It was after this incident that Aureliano heard these words from his father's mouth:</t508>
<t509>-If you do not fear God, at least let the miracle of the mines instill the fear of God in you.</t509>
<t510>Ursula suddenly reappeared about five months after her mysterious disappearance.</t510> <t511>She had undergone a transformation, becoming elevated, rejuvenated, and dressed in a manner unfamiliar to the villagers.</t511> <t512>When Jose Arcadio Buendia saw her like this in front of him, his knees gave way.</t512> <t513>That's it! he shouted, I knew this would happen.</t513> <t514>Indeed, while he had been secluded all that time preparing the materials for the alchemist's stone, he had prayed from the depths of his heart, yearning for the awaited miracle, not the discovery of the philosopher's stone or the release of the breath that would animate metals, or the ability to turn the hinges and locks in the house into gold, but for the event of that very moment to happen, for Ursula to return.</t514> <t515>But Ursula paid no attention to his excitement.</t515> <t516>After giving her husband a perfunctory kiss as if she had been gone for just an hour, she said, Look outside.</t516>
<t517>Jose Arcadio Buendia, when he went out into the street and saw the crowd, was unable to recover from his astonishment for a long time and couldn't figure out what was happening.</t517> <t518>These people were not gypsies.</t518> <t519>They were people with straight hair like theirs, dark-skinned, speaking the same language, complaining about the same things.</t519> <t520>They had mules loaded with food, carts filled with household and kitchen items, in short, the pure and simple goods sold without embellishment by traveling vendors within the daily reality.</t520> <t521>They came from a place just two days' journey beyond the swamp, where the mail arrived every month of the year and where people knew the blessings of life.</t521> <t522>Ursula had not been able to find the gypsies, but she had found the road that her husband, due to his obsession with great inventions, had failed to discover.</t522>
<t523>Pilar Ternera's son was brought to his grandfather's house two weeks after he was born.</t523><t524>Ursula reluctantly took the child into the house, yielding to her husband's insistence that a child of their own blood should not be left out in the cold, but on the condition that the child would not learn his true identity.</t524><t525>They named the boy Jose Arcadio, but to avoid confusion later, they started calling him simply Arcadio.</t525><t526>At that time, there was such activity in the village and such hustle and bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to the background.</t526><t527>The children were entrusted to a woman named Visitacion, one of the Guajiro Indians, who had come to the village with her brother, fleeing the insomnia plague that had ravaged their tribe for years.</t527><t528>The Indian siblings were so meek and so willing to be subservient that Ursula had taken them in to help with the household chores.</t528><t529>Thus, Arcadio and Amaranta began speaking the Guajiro language fluently before they even mastered Spanish, learning to eat lizard soup and spider eggs without Ursula's knowledge, who was absorbed in making and selling animal-shaped candies.</t529>
<t530>Macondo had changed.</t530> <t531>Those who came with Ursula spread the word so enthusiastically about how much better this place was compared to the swamp, praising its fertile soil, that the once isolated village transformed into a bustling town with shops, workshops, and a constantly busy caravan route.</t531> <t532>The first to arrive via this route were Arabs with baggy trousers and earrings, who bartered large parrots for glass beads.</t532> <t533>Jose Arcadio Buendia had no time to scratch his head.</t533> <t534>Enchanted by the tangible reality that seemed even more fantastical than the boundless universe created by his imagination, Jose Arcadio Buendia stopped paying attention to his alchemy laboratory, set aside the materials he had painstakingly prepared over months, and became as proactive as he was in the days when he decided where the streets would lead and where the houses would be built to ensure no one was wronged.</t534> <t535>He established such dominance over the newcomers that no foundation was laid, nor any wall built without consulting him, and eventually, they decided to put him in charge of land distribution.</t535>
<t536>When the acrobat gypsies, who had turned the old travelers' fair into a huge casino of fortune and gambling games, returned, they were greeted with great fanfare, thinking that Jose Arcadio had returned with them.</t536> <t537>However, Jose Arcadio did not return, and according to Ursula, the snake man, the only person who could tell where her son was, was also not there.</t537> <t538>As a result, the gypsies were not allowed to stay in the town because they were said to spread lust and perversion wherever they went, and they were warned never to set foot there again.</t538> <t539>However, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not forget to say that the doors of the town were always open to the tribe of Melquiades, who had greatly contributed to the development of the town with his infinite wisdom and unique inventions.</t539> <t540>Nevertheless, according to what the nomads said, Melquiades' tribe had been wiped off the face of the earth because it had surpassed the limits of human comprehension.</t540>
<t541>At least for now, freed from the torment of his imagination, Jose Arcadio Buendia established such an order and work system in a short time that only one thing was free: the permission to release the birds, which had been bringing joy to life with their chirping since the founding days of the village, and replace them with a clock in every house.</t541> <t542>These were wooden clocks traded by the Arabs for parrots.</t542> <t543>Jose Arcadio Buendia set the clocks so perfectly that the town was enlivened every half hour by the successive chorus of the same tune, and when noon arrived, the sounds of a waltz rising uninterruptedly and in unison filled everywhere.</t543>
<t544>It was also Jose Arcadio Buendia who decided to plant almond trees instead of acacias in the streets during those years and found a way to make the almonds immortal without ever revealing his secret.</t544> <t545>Years later, when Macondo was filled with wooden houses with zinc roofs, the almond trees, with their broken and dusty branches, stood in the oldest streets, long forgotten who had planted them.</t545> <t546>While his father was busy organizing the town and his mother was making money from the business of distributing rooster and fish-shaped candies attached to sandalwood sticks twice a day, Aureliano would lock himself in the abandoned laboratory for hours, teaching himself the art of silverwork.</t546> <t547>He had grown so quickly that, soon after, when his older brother's clothes no longer fit him, he started wearing his father's, but since he was not as stocky as the others, Visitacion would pleat the shirts and put darts in the pants.</t547>
<t548>Puberty had taken away the softness of his voice, making the young man silent and introverted, but at the same time, it had restored the intense expression in his eyes that he had at birth.</t548><t549>He had devoted himself to silverwork so much that he rarely left the laboratory, even to eat.</t549><t550>Thinking that he might need a woman, Jose Arcadio Buendia gave him the keys to the house and some money.</t550><t551>But Aureliano used the money to buy hydrochloric acid to make a solution for melting gold and decorated the keys with gold plating.</t551><t552>Aureliano's excesses paled in comparison to what Amaranta and Arcadio did, who, despite starting to grow their seven-year molars, still clung to the Indian woman's skirt and stubbornly spoke in the Guajiro language instead of Spanish.</t552><t553>Ursula would say to her husband, "You have no right to complain; they take after their lineage, what can you do."</t553><t554>While Ursula cursed her misfortune, believing that her children's wildness was as terrible as a pig's tail, Aureliano gave her such a look that she froze, not knowing what to do.</t554>
<t555>"Someone is coming," said the young man.</t555>
<t556>Ursula, as she did with every prophecy of her son, tried to interpret this one with the logic of a housewife.</t556> <t557>It could happen, someone might come.</t557> <t558>Every day, a bunch of strangers came to Macondo, none of whom aroused suspicion or became the subject of prophecy.</t558> <t559>However, Aureliano was too convinced of the accuracy of his prophecy to heed this logic.</t559>
<t560>"I don't know who it is," he said, "but whoever it is, they have already set off."</t560>
<t561>Indeed, that Sunday arrived, Rebeca.</t561> <t562>She was only eleven years old.</t562> <t563>She had made a strenuous journey from Manaure to Macondo with leather merchants who had taken on the task of bringing the girl along with a letter addressed to Jose Arcadio Buendia, but who could not for the life of them remember who had entrusted the child to them.</t563> <t564>All her belongings consisted of a small trunk, a rocking chair decorated with tiny hand-painted flowers, and a sack that made a rattling noise with every swing, containing the bones of her mother and father.</t564> <t565>The letter addressed to Jose Arcadio was written with extremely heartfelt words by someone who still loved and respected him despite the long time and distance that had come between their friendship.</t565> <t566>The letter writer, being the daughter of Ursula's cousin's cousin and that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his dear wife Rebeca Montiel, and thus distantly related to Jose Arcadio Buendia, wrote that by sending this homeless orphan girl to him, they believed they were fulfilling a humanitarian duty, and noted that they had placed the bones of the girl's parents in the sack so they could be buried according to Christian rites.</t566>
<t567>The names mentioned in the letter, as well as the signature at the bottom, were clearly legible, but neither Jose Arcadio Buendia nor Ursula could figure out if they had a relative with that name.</t567> <t568>They also did not recognize the name of the sender.</t568> <t569>The village called Manaure had never reached their ears.</t569> <t570>It was not possible to learn anything from the girl either.</t570> <t571>As soon as the girl arrived, she sat in her rocking chair, sucking her finger, and began to watch everyone with her big, bewildered eyes, showing no sign that she understood the questions being asked.</t571> <t572>She wore an old, tattered dress that had once been striped but was later dyed black, and shoes with peeling patent leather.</t572> <t573>Her hair was gathered behind her ears with two black ribbons.</t573> <t574>She had on a sweat-faded cotton shirt and a copper-framed amulet made from a carnivorous animal's tooth on her right arm.</t574> <t575>Her skin, tinged with green, and her drum-tight, swollen belly were signs of an illness and poverty that had begun before she was born, but when food was placed in front of her, she simply held the plate on her knees without taking a single bite.</t575>
<t576>They almost believed that the girl was deaf and mute, but finally, the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted water, and the girl blinked and nodded as if she recognized them, saying yes.</t576> <t577>Since they had no other option, they kept the girl at home.</t577> <t578>Aureliano, trying to guess her name, patiently listed all the saints' names, but when he got no reaction from the girl, he finally called her by the name mentioned in the letter, and they called her Rebeca.</t578> <t579>Since no one had died yet and there was no cemetery in Macondo, they left the sack of bones in the open to find a suitable place to bury it.</t579>
<t580>The sack kept getting caught on people's feet and, with a clattering sound similar to a hen clucking on its nest, would appear in the most unexpected places.</t580> <t581>It took Rebeca a very long time to adapt to family life.</t581> <t582>She would go to the farthest corners of the house, sucking her thumb while sitting in her rocking chair.</t582> <t583>She was interested in nothing but the chiming of the clock, and every half hour, she would nervously dart her eyes around as if trying to catch the sound in the air.</t583> <t584>For several days, they couldn't get her to eat a single bite.</t584> <t585>While they wondered how she hadn't died of starvation yet, the Indians, who silently roamed the house and knew everything that was going on, discovered that Rebeca was eating the damp earth from the yard and pieces of lime she scraped off the walls with her nails.</t585> <t586>Judging by the fact that she did this secretly and with a sense of guilt, hiding her stash to eat when no one was around, her parents or whoever raised her must have scolded her a lot for this habit.</t586> <t587>To break her of this bad habit, they spread cow manure in the yard and rubbed red pepper on the walls, but the girl showed such cunning and skill in finding earth that Ursula had to take even stricter measures.</t587>
<t588>After placing the orange juice and rhubarb root in a pot and leaving it out in the frost all night, she made the girl drink it on an empty stomach the next morning.</t588> <t589>Although no one had said that this remedy would cure the habit of eating dirt, Ursula figured that if something bitter entered an empty stomach, the liver would react to it.</t589> <t590>Rebeca was so rebellious and, despite her frailty, so strong that even though they tied her hands and feet like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, she kept kicking, cursing in her native language with the most unmentionable words according to the Indians, and biting and spitting on anyone who came near her.</t590> <t591>When Ursula learned of this, she added the whip to her treatment method.</t591> <t592>Whether it was the rhubarb laxative, the beating, or both, it is unknown, but within a few weeks, Rebeca began to show signs of improvement.</t592> <t593>She joined the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who saw her as a sister, and ate heartily, using the knife and fork properly.</t593> <t594>It was also soon understood that she spoke Spanish as well as the Indians' language, was very skilled in handicrafts, and accompanied the clock's chime with her own nonsensical words.</t594>
<t595>The household soon began to see her as one of the family.</t595> <t596>She would cuddle up to Ursula more than her own children, call Arcadio and Amaranta her siblings, Aureliano her uncle, and Jose Arcadio Buendia her grandfather.</t596> <t597>Thus, in the end, she earned the right to take the name Rebeca Buendia like the other children, and she carried this name with honor until the end of her life.</t597>
<t598>At the time when Rebeca overcame her habit of eating dirt and started sleeping in the same room with the other children, one night, the Indian woman who slept in the same room woke up and heard a strange clattering noise coming from the corner.</t598> <t599>Thinking that an animal had entered the room, she jumped up in a panic and saw Rebeca sitting in a rocking chair with her finger in her mouth, her eyes shining like a cat's in the dark.</t599> <t600>Visitacion, who had fallen victim to blind fate, saw with horror the signs of the disease that had once forced them to flee from the century-old kingdom where they were prince and princess, in Rebeca's eyes.</t600> <t601>It was the disease of insomnia.</t601>
<t602>The next morning, they saw that the Indian Cataure had left the house.</t602><t603>His sister did not go with him because a voice inside her said that even if he went to the other end of the world, this deadly disease would not leave him alone.</t603><t604>No one could understand Visitacion's panic.</t604><t605>Jose Arcadio Buendia, making a joke of it, said, The less we sleep, the better, that way we get more out of life.</t605><t606>But the Indian woman explained at length that the most frightening aspect of the disease was not the sleeplessness, as it did not cause fatigue, but that it gradually became worse and led to memory loss.</t606><t607>According to her, once someone got used to the sleeplessness, they first forgot memories from their childhood, then they gradually forgot the names and uses of objects, eventually they did not recognize people, forgot themselves, and fell into a void of memory without a past.</t607><t608>Jose Arcadio Buendia, thinking it was one of the diseases stemming from Indian superstitions, laughed heartily.</t608><t609>However, Ursula, just in case, separated Rebeca from the other children.</t609>
<t610>A few weeks later, just as Visitacion was beginning to settle down one night, Jose Arcadio Buendia, unable to sleep, started tossing and turning in bed.</t610> <t611>Ursula was also awake, and when she asked her husband, "What's wrong?" Jose Arcadio Buendia replied, "Prudencio Aguilar is on my mind again."</t611> <t612>They didn't close their eyes for a minute that night, but the next day, since they didn't feel any discomfort, they forgot what had happened during the night.</t612> <t613>At lunch, Aureliano, who had stayed up all night in the laboratory to dip the needle he was going to give Ursula as a birthday present in gold, explained with surprise that he didn't feel tired at all.</t613> <t614>They didn't panic until the third day, when it was time to go to bed, and they realized that no one was sleepy and that they hadn't slept for more than fifty hours.</t614>
<t615>The Native American woman, with her resigned attitude towards fate, said, "The children didn't sleep either."</t615> <t616>Once illness enters a house, no one can escape it.</t616> <t617>Indeed, they had fallen victim to the affliction of insomnia.</t617> <t618>Ursula, who had learned the healing properties of plants from her mother, immediately brewed some aconite syrup and gave it to everyone to drink, but none of them could sleep, and they spent the evening daydreaming while standing.</t618> <t619>In this hallucinatory wakefulness, they not only saw the people in their own dreams but also those who appeared in others' dreams.</t619> <t620>It was as if a crowd of guests had filled the house.</t620> <t621>Rebeca, sitting in the rocking chair in the corner of the kitchen, saw a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linens, bringing a bouquet of roses from under the top button of his shirt.</t621>
<t622>The woman next to the man pulled a rose from the bouquet with her elegant hands and placed it in the child's hair.</t622><t623>Ursula deduced that the man and woman were Rebeca's parents, but despite her efforts to recall where she knew them from, she ultimately concluded that she had never seen them in her life.</t623><t624>While all this was happening, Jose Arcadio Buendia, having been careless and not taken precautions, allowed the animal-shaped sweets made at home to continue being sold in the town.</t624><t625>Everyone from seven to seventy was sucking on those irresistible green roosters infected with insomnia, those beautiful pink fish soaked in insomnia, and those sweet little yellow foals dipped in insomnia.</t625><t626>Thus, the sun that rose on Monday morning found the entire town awake.</t626><t627>At first, no one panicked.</t627><t628>On the contrary, they were happy not to sleep, because at that time there was so much work to be done in Macondo that no one had time to keep up.</t628><t629>They worked so much that soon they were crossing their arms and counting the clock's chimes at three in the morning.</t629><t630>Those who wanted to sleep not out of fatigue but simply because they missed dreaming tried every method they could think of to exhaust themselves and fall asleep.</t630><t631>They gathered together and engaged in endless conversations, repeated the same jokes for hours on end, and stretched out the barren rooster story as much as they could.</t631>
<t632>It was a tale that stretched on and on, the storyteller would ask, "Shall I tell you the tale of the barren rooster?" If they said yes, he would say, "I didn't ask you to say yes, I asked if you wanted me to tell the tale of the barren rooster."</t632> <t633>If the listeners said no, the storyteller would say, "I didn't ask you to say no, I asked if you wanted the tale of the barren rooster," and he would get out of it that way.</t633> <t634>If no one made a sound, the storyteller would say, "I didn't ask you to be silent, I asked if you wanted me to tell the tale of the barren rooster," and he would start all over again.</t634> <t635>If someone tried to leave, the storyteller would say, "Did I tell you to leave? I asked if you wanted the tale of the barren rooster," and he would make them sit down, and thus the tale would go on and on, night after night, without end.</t635>
<t636>When Jose Arcadio Buendia realized that the illness had spread throughout the entire town, he gathered the heads of the families and told them what he knew about the insomnia plague. In the end, they decided to take measures to prevent the disease from spreading to other towns in the swamp.</t636> <t637>They took the bells that the Arabs had given in exchange for parrots off the goats' necks and placed them at the town's entrance gate for those who tried to enter the town without heeding the guards' advice and warnings to wear.</t637> <t638>In those days, strangers walking the streets of Macondo rang these bells so that those who were infected with the disease would understand that they were healthy and keep their distance.</t638> <t639>During their stay in Macondo, they were not allowed to eat or drink anything, because there was no doubt that the disease was transmitted through the mouth; insomnia had contaminated all food and drinks.</t639> <t640>Thus, they ensured that the disease remained within the town's borders.</t640> <t641>This quarantine was so effective that, over time, the extraordinary situation became ordinary, life took on a new order, work regained its old rhythm, and no one bothered about that unnecessary habit of sleep anymore.</t641>
<t642>Aureliano accidentally discovered the formula that would prevent memory loss for at least a few months.</t642> <t643>Since he was one of the first to contract the disease, he had become an expert in this field and had also achieved perfect mastery in the art of silver processing.</t643> <t644>One day, while looking for the small anvil he used to hammer metal foils, he couldn't remember its name.</t644> <t645>He asked his father, and his father said "Iskaça."</t645> <t646>Aureliano wrote this down on a piece of paper and stuck it to the handle of the anvil: Iskaça.</t646> <t647>This way, he wouldn't forget it again.</t647> <t648>Since the name of the thing was already peculiar, it didn't occur to him that this might be the first sign of memory loss.</t648> <t649>But a few days later, he realized that he could hardly remember the names of any of the objects in the laboratory.</t649> <t650>So, he wrote down the names of all of them and stuck the labels on; now, when he looked at them, he knew what they were.</t650>
<t651>When his father complained that he had come to forget even the most important memories of his childhood, Aureliano shared the method he had found with his father, and Jose Arcadio Buendia first applied it at home, then throughout the entire town.</t651> <t652>He dipped the brush in ink and wrote the name of everything on it: table, chair, clock, pot, wall, bed, pan.</t652>
<t653>He went to the pen and labeled every animal and plant there with tags like cow, goat, pig, chicken, cassava, caladium, and banana.</t653> <t654>As he studied how far memory loss could go over time, he realized that they could deduce the names of objects from the tags, but would forget what they were used for.</t654> <t655>Then he took it a step further.</t655> <t656>The note he hung around the cow's neck is concrete evidence of how prepared the people of Macondo were against memory loss: This is called a cow.</t656> <t657>It needs to be milked every morning so that it gives milk, and the milk must be boiled to mix with coffee to make café con leche.</t657> <t658>Thus, they began to live a reality that was momentarily grasped by names, but slipped away from their hands the moment they forgot what the written letters meant.</t658>
<t659>They placed a sign that read Macondo at the beginning of the road leading to the swamp.</t659> <t660>They hung a sign that read God Exists on the main street.</t660> <t661>In all the houses, writings were put up to remind people of objects and emotions.</t661> <t662>But this system required such great attention and strong nerves that most people succumbed to the enchantment of a self-invented, useless but comforting imaginary reality.</t662> <t663>Pilar Ternera, who once read the future by laying out cards, now played the biggest role in spreading this deception by claiming to read the past.</t663> <t664>In this way, those afflicted by the insomnia plague began to live in a world built on the uncertain possibilities of the cards.</t664> <t665>According to the cards, someone's father was the dark-skinned man who arrived at the beginning of April, someone's mother was the dark-skinned woman who wore a gold ring on her left hand, and someone's birthday was the last Tuesday when the skylark perched on the laurel branch and sang.</t665>
<t666>In the face of these means of distraction, Jose Arcadio Buendio, who had fallen into despondency, decided to create the memory machine he had once planned to make in order to remember the unique inventions of the gypsies.</t666> <t667>This marvel, created by human hands, was based on the idea of refreshing all the knowledge acquired throughout a lifetime every morning from start to finish.</t667> <t668>He was designing it in the form of a rotating dictionary.</t668> <t669>By turning the handle mounted on the axis of the dictionary, the wheel would spin, and the most essential information in a person's life would pass before their eyes within a few hours.</t669>
<t670>Just as he was finishing writing almost fourteen thousand articles, a strange-looking person appeared, pulling a black cloth-covered handcart with a tightly packed suitcase tied with a rope in his hand, and ringing the mournful bell of the sleepers, coming from the road out of the swamp.</t670> <t671>He went straight to Jose Arcadio Buendia's house.</t671> <t672>When Visitacion opened the door, she did not recognize him; at first, she thought he was a vendor unaware that nothing could be sold in a town irreversibly mired in forgetfulness.</t672> <t673>He was so old that he could barely move his hands and feet.</t673> <t674>Despite the tremor in his voice and the shakiness of his hands, it was still clear that he came from a world where people could still sleep and remember.</t674> <t675>Jose Arcadio Buendia found him sitting in the living room, fanning himself with his patched black hat while carefully reading the writings pasted on the walls.</t675> <t676>Thinking that perhaps he had once known him very well but could not remember now, he greeted the man with a great show of affection to avoid making a faux pas.</t676>
<t677>The visitor noticed this affectation.</t677> <t678>He realized that it was forgotten not with the irreparable forgetfulness of the heart, but with a much more relentless and irrevocable kind of forgetfulness.</t678> <t679>He knew this forgetfulness well, because it was the forgetfulness of death.</t679> <t680>It was then that he woke up.</t680> <t681>He opened the suitcase filled with nondescript objects and took out a box containing a bunch of bottles.</t681> <t682>As soon as he made Jose Arcadio Buendia drink a pale-colored liquid, his mind cleared up.</t682> <t683>Jose Arcadio Buendia's eyes filled with tears before he could realize he was in a strange living room where everything was labeled, feel ashamed of the nonsense written on the walls, recognize the visitor, and be overjoyed.</t683> <t684>The visitor was Melquiades.</t684>
<t685>While the people of Macondo were celebrating their regained memories, Jose Arcadio Buendia and Melquiades rekindled their dormant friendship.</t685> <t686>The gypsy intended to stay in the town.</t686> <t687>He had indeed gone to the other world, but had returned because he couldn't bear the loneliness.</t687> <t688>Rejected by his tribe, having lost his supernatural powers due to his attachment to life, he decided to retreat to this remote corner where death had not yet been discovered and dedicate himself to taking photographs on zinc plates.</t688> <t689>Jose Arcadio Buendia was unaware of this invention.</t689> <t690>But he was struck dumb with amazement when he saw himself and all his family members depicted forever on an iridescent metal plate.</t690> <t691>The photograph, which showed Jose Arcadio Buendia with his grizzled and spiky hair, his shirt fastened with a cardboard collar held by a copper button, and that bewildered seriousness that Ursula mocked by saying he looked like a frightened general, dated back to that time.</t691> <t692>On that clear December morning when the photograph was taken, Jose Arcadio Buendia, thinking that while everyone else would slowly fade away, he would remain forever on a metal plate, was genuinely scared.</t692> <t693>This time, contrary to the usual, it was Ursula who calmed him down and erased this thought from his mind, deciding to let Melquiades stay in the house, having forgotten her old grudge, but she never agreed to have her photograph taken, as she (in her own words) did not want to become a source of amusement for her grandchildren.</t693>
<t694>That morning, she dressed the children in their holiday clothes, powdered their faces, and gave each of them a spoonful of marrow broth so they could stand still for about two minutes in front of Melquiades' incredible machine without moving a muscle.</t694> <t695>In that unique family photograph, Aureliano, dressed in black velvet, was standing between Amaranta and Rebeca.</t695> <t696>On his face was that reluctant expression, reflecting his clairvoyant sensitivity, which he would have years later when he faced the firing squad.</t696> <t697>But he had not yet foreseen what would happen to him.</t697> <t698>He was a master silversmith, renowned throughout the swampy region for the delicacy of his work.</t698> <t699>He worked silently in the workshop he shared with Melquiades.</t699> <t700>While his father and the gypsy, amidst the clinking of bottles and trays, the spilling acids, and the constant shimmer of silver bromide appearing and disappearing on the photographic plate, loudly tried to decipher Nostradamus' prophecies, Aureliano seemed to escape and take refuge in another time.</t700> <t701>Due to his dedication and meticulousness in his work, Aureliano soon earned more money than Ursula did from her sweets, but everyone found it strange that, despite being a grown man, he had no relationships with any women.</t701>
<t702>Indeed, he had not yet touched a woman's hand.</t702> <t703>A few months later, Francisco the Devil-Breaker showed up.</t703> <t704>This two-hundred-year-old vagabond would come and go to Macondo every now and then, spreading the folk songs he wrote and composed himself.</t704> <t705>In these songs, Francisco the Devil-Breaker would recount the events that happened in the towns along the road from Manaure to the edge of the swamp.</t705> <t706>Therefore, anyone who wanted to convey a message or announce something from one town to another would slip two coins into Francisco's palm, and he would include the news in his song.</t706> <t707>Listening to these songs in the hope of hearing news from her son Jose Arcadio, Ursula learned of her mother's death in this way.</t707> <t708>Francisco, who became famous as Francisco the Devil-Breaker for defeating the devil in an impromptu folk song contest and whose real name no one knew, had slipped away from Macondo during the insomnia plague.</t708> <t709>One night, just as suddenly as he had left, he appeared in Catarino's shop.</t709>
<t710>When he arrived this time, there was a woman with him who was so fat that she couldn't lift herself up and walk.</t710> <t711>Four Native Americans were carrying the woman from place to place with a rocking chair that they could barely move, and a melancholy-faced young mestizo girl was staying by the woman's side with an umbrella to keep the sun off her head.</t711> <t712>That night, Aureliano went to Cacarino's shop.</t712> <t713>Francisco was sitting in the middle of a circle of listeners, like a chameleon carved from a single piece of stone, playing that same old accordion given to him by Sir Walter Raleigh in Guiana, tapping the rhythm with his feet, which were cracked from saltpeter and accustomed to stomping, and singing news with his familiar, raspy voice.</t713>
<t714>In front of the large door at the back, where people were constantly coming and going, the owner of the rocking chair sat silently, fanning herself.</t714> <t715>Catarino, with an artificial rose tucked behind his ear, was selling pitcher after pitcher of sugarcane juice to the gathered crowd, while also taking the opportunity to grope the men here and there.</t715> <t716>By midnight, the heat became unbearable.</t716> <t717>Aureliano listened to the news until the end, but heard nothing that concerned his family.</t717> <t718>Just as he was about to head home, a fat woman gestured and called him over.</t718>
<t719>"Why don't you come inside too," he said.</t719> <t720>"It's only twenty cents."</t720>
<t721>Aureliano, without understanding why, threw the money into the bowl on the woman's lap and entered the room.</t721> <t722>The young mestizo girl was lying completely naked with tiny dog-like breasts.</t722> <t723>That night, sixty-three men had been with her before Aureliano.</t723> <t724>The air in the room had started to thicken with sweat and breath, becoming almost muddy.</t724> <t725>The girl pulled the soaking sheet and handed one end to Aureliano.</t725> <t726>The sheet had become as heavy as a sailcloth.</t726> <t727>They twisted it from both ends, wringing out the water until it returned to its normal weight.</t727> <t728>They flipped the mattress over, but the sweat had soaked through to the other side as well.</t728> <t729>Aureliano was hoping these tasks would never end.</t729>
<t730>Although he knew about love games from hearsay, his legs were so weak that he could barely stand, and despite being in his adolescence, his face was burning like fire and he was almost about to wet himself out of fear.</t730> <t731>When the girl made the bed and told him to undress, Aureliano started to stammer: They forced me in here.</t731> <t732>They said, throw twenty cents into the bowl and be quick about it.</t732> <t733>The girl understood his confusion.</t733> <t734>In a soft voice, she said, if you throw another twenty cents when you leave, you can stay inside longer.</t734> <t735>Aureliano, comparing his own naked state with his brother's, undressed, sinking into the ground with shame.</t735> <t736>No matter how much effort the girl put in, Aureliano became increasingly indifferent, increasingly withdrawn.</t736> <t737>In a miserable voice, he muttered, I'll throw in another twenty cents.</t737> <t738>The girl thanked him quietly.</t738> <t739>Her back was peeling from lying down so much.</t739> <t740>Her skin clung to her ribs, and she was breathless from deadly exhaustion.</t740>
<t741>Two years ago, in a place far away, he had fallen asleep without extinguishing the candle and woke up surrounded by flames.</t741> <t742>The house he lived in with his grandmother had burned down to ashes.</t742> <t743>After that, his grandmother started taking him from town to town, and to make up for the burned house, she had him sleep with anyone who could pay twenty cents.</t743> <t744>According to the girl's calculations, she needed to sleep with seventy people a night for another ten years, because she had to cover the travel and food expenses not only for herself and her grandmother but also for the Indians carrying the rocking chair.</t744> <t745>When Mama knocked on the door for the second time, Aureliano, unable to accomplish anything, left the room on the verge of tears.</t745>
<t746>That night, he spent thinking about the girl, on one hand with desire, on the other with pity, until morning.</t746> <t747>He felt an irresistible urge to love and protect her.</t747> <t748>At dawn, exhausted from sleeplessness and the fire of desire, he made his decision: He would marry her to save her from her tyrannical grandmother and to savor those fulfilling nights shared by seventy men alone.</t748> <t749>However, when he arrived at Catarino's shop at ten in the morning, the girl had already left town.</t749>
<t750>As time extinguished this mad desire to marry, it also increased his sense of emptiness.</t750> <t751>He threw himself into his work with all his might.</t751> <t752>To hide the shame of his uselessness, he vowed to remain without a woman for life.</t752> <t753>Meanwhile, Melquiades had printed everything in Macondo that could be photographed onto zinc plates and had left the photo lab to Jose Arcadio Buendia, who had decided to use it to scientifically prove the existence of God.</t753> <t754>Jose Arcadio Buendia was convinced that by taking overlapping photographs in different parts of the house, he would eventually capture an image of God, if He existed, or put an end to the claims about God's existence.</t754>
<t755>Melquiades devoted himself entirely to interpreting Nostradamus's prophecies.</t755> <t756>He would sit until late hours, gasping for breath in his faded velvet vest, scribbling with his sparrow-like hands adorned with rings that had lost their former brilliance.</t756> <t757>One night, he thought he had found a prophecy foretelling the future of Macondo.</t757>
<t758>Macondo will be a town full of glittering large houses made of glass, and there will be no trace left of the Buendia lineage.</t758> <t759>Jose Arcadio Buendia roared, "That's wrong, the houses will be made of ice as I saw in my dream, not glass, and the Buendia lineage will endure as long as the world exists, per omnia secula seculorum."</t759>
<t760>Ursula was doing her best to maintain common sense in this house full of excesses.</t760> <t761>Meanwhile, she had expanded her candy-making business, establishing a large bakery.</t761> <t762>The bakery worked all night, producing baskets of bread, buns, and cookies, and the goods from the oven were transported and sold out within hours along the roads winding through the swamp.</t762> <t763>Ursula had reached the age where she could sit back and rest, yet she was working harder with each passing day.</t763> <t764>She was so engrossed in her money-making ventures that one day, while adding sugar to the dough with the Indian woman, her eyes drifted to the garden, where she saw two beautiful girls she didn't recognize, sitting under the sun and working on embroidery.</t764>
<t765>These were Rebeca and Amaranta.</t765> <t766>As soon as they discarded the mourning clothes they had stubbornly worn for three years after their grandmother's death, the colorful clothes they wore seemed to have earned them a whole new place in the world.</t766> <t767>Contrary to expectations, the more beautiful of the girls was Rebeca.</t767> <t768>She was a fair-skinned girl with large, calming eyes, and skillful hands that seemed to embroider patterns with invisible threads.</t768>
<t769>The younger Amaranta was a bit rough, but she had inherited her late grandmother's natural charm and resilience.</t769> <t770>Although it was clear she would be as tall and imposing as her father, Arcadio looked like a child next to them.</t770> <t771>Arcadio had learned to read and write from Aureliano and was now trying to master silverwork.</t771> <t772>It suddenly dawned on Úrsula that the house was filled with grown-ups, and she realized that her children were almost old enough to get married and start their own families, and that they would scatter due to the lack of space in the house.</t772> <t773>So, she took out the money she had saved up over the years, collected a bit more from her customers, and set about expanding the house.</t773> <t774>She added a guest room for occasional visitors, a daily sitting room, a dining room with a table that could seat twelve people, nine bedrooms overlooking the garden, and a terrace that would be shaded by the rose garden in the afternoon heat, with ferns and begonia pots lined up along its railings. She also enlarged the kitchen to fit two stoves.</t774> <t775>The pantry where Pilar Ternera had read José Arcadio's fortune was demolished and replaced with a new pantry twice its size to ensure there would never be a shortage of food in the house.</t775>
<t776>Ursula had two outhouses built under the shade of the chestnut tree in the garden, one for women and the other for men, a large barn in the back garden, a chicken coop surrounded by wire mesh, a shed for the milk-giving cows, and an aviary open to the wind from all sides so that the passing birds could perch as they pleased.</t776> <t777>Just like her husband, who seemed to be in a feverish delirium, Ursula would follow with a troop of masons and carpenters, deciding where the light and heat would come from, and without worrying about keeping the job small, she was creating a spacious place.</t777> <t778>The primitive structure built by the village founders was filled with tools, materials, and workers who, tired of the clattering bone sack that followed them wherever they went, would tell anyone who would listen not to be a hindrance.</t778> <t779>In the chaos where the smell of quicklime and tar filled the entire town and everyone's lungs, no one noticed how not only the largest structure in the town but also the coolest house ever built in the swampy region, with its doors always open to guests, suddenly rose as if it had sprouted from the ground.</t779>
<t780>In the chaos, Jose Arcadio Buendia, who tried to catch God off guard and take His picture, was the person who understood the least about how the house was built and completed.</t780> <t781>As the house neared completion, Ursula informed her husband, pulling him out of his dream world, that she had received orders to paint the facade blue instead of white as they wanted.</t781> <t782>She showed the official document.</t782> <t783>Not understanding what his wife was talking about, Jose Arcadio Buendia read the signature at the bottom of the paper.</t783>
<t784>"Who is this man?" he asked.</t784>
<t785>-He was a justice of the peace, Ursula replied with sadness.</t785>
<t786>-He was an official sent by the government.</t786>
<t787>The magistrate Don Apolinar Moscote had arrived in Macondo quietly and unobtrusively.</t787> <t788>He stayed at the Jacob Hotel, built by one of the first Arabs who bartered parrots and knick-knacks, and the next day rented a one-room house with a door opening onto the street, two blocks away from the Buendia's house.</t788> <t789>He placed a table and a chair he got from Jacob in the room, hung the state emblem he had brought with him on the wall, and wrote "Magistrate" on the door.</t789> <t790>The first order he issued was that all houses be painted blue in celebration of the anniversary of national independence.</t790> <t791>Jose Arcadio Buendia, who grabbed the decree and rushed to the magistrate's house, found him lying in a hammock he had set up in the room, taking a nap.</t791> <t792>Did you write this? he asked.</t792> <t793>Don Apolinar Moscote, a middle-aged, red-faced, timid man, replied, Yes.</t793> <t794>On what authority? Jose Arcadio Buendia pressed.</t794> <t795>Don Apolinar Moscote took a paper out of the desk drawer and showed it.</t795> <t796>I was appointed as the magistrate of this town.</t796> <t797>Jose Arcadio Buendia didn't even look at the appointment document.</t797> <t798>Without losing his composure, he said, In this town, we don't issue orders on written paper.</t798> <t799>And get this straight, we don't need a magistrate, because we never have any need for one.</t799>
<t800>Standing in front of Don Apolinar Moscote without raising his voice, he explained one by one how they founded the village, how they distributed the land, how they opened the roads, and how they did everything necessary without bothering the government and without allowing anyone to disturb them.</t800> <t801>"We live in such peace that not even one of us has met their end yet," he said.</t801> <t802>"As you can see, we don't even have a cemetery."</t802> <t803>No one was upset because they didn't receive help from the government.</t803> <t804>On the contrary, everyone was pleased with their situation because the government hadn't disturbed their peace so far, and they wanted it to continue this way; they hadn't founded this town for any upstart to come and give orders.</t804>
<t805>While he was explaining these things, Don Apolinar Moscote, without losing his grace for a moment, had put on his jacket made of the same white cotton as his trousers.</t805> <t806>Jose Arcadio Buendia finished his words by saying, "If you intend to sit here like one of us, you are more than welcome, but if you are going to cause trouble by painting people's houses blue, you better pack up and go back to where you came from."</t806> <t807>"Because my house will be as white as a dove."</t807>
<t808>Don Apolinar Moscote turned pale.</t808> <t809>He took a step back, clenched his teeth, and spoke with a somewhat sorrowful demeanor:</t809>
<t810>-Know that I am armed.</t810>
<t811>Jose Arcadio Buendia, without understanding how his hands, which once knocked down horses with a single blow, regained the same strength, grabbed Don Apolinar Moscote by the collar, lifted him into the air, and held him at eye level.</t811>
<t812>"I am doing this because I prefer to carry you around alive rather than dead for the rest of my life," he said.</t812>
<t813>Then he grabbed the man by his collar, lifted him into the air, and carried him out to the street, taking him all the way to the start of the swamp road before setting him down on his feet.</t813> <t814>A week later, the man returned, accompanied by six barefoot, bald-headed soldiers armed with shotguns, and with his wife and seven daughters crammed into an ox cart.</t814> <t815>Two more carts loaded with household items, suitcases, and kitchen utensils followed.</t815> <t816>Don Apolinar Moscote settled his family into the Jacob Hotel and began searching for a house.</t816>
<t817>In the meantime, he reopened his office under the protection of the soldiers.</t817> <t818>The founders of Macondo, determined to drive out the invaders from the town, took their eldest sons with them and went to Jose Arcadio Buendia, saying they were at his command.</t818> <t819>But Jose Arcadio Buendia objected, saying that humiliating a man in front of his family was not manly.</t819> <t820>He explained that Don Apolinar had brought his wife and daughters with him.</t820> <t821>Therefore, he decided to resolve the matter amicably.</t821>
<t822>Aureliano went with him.</t822> <t823>At that time, he had just started to grow out the black mustache he used to twist with paraffin at the ends, and his voice, which was one of his greatest assets on the battlefield, was approaching a thunderous boom.</t823> <t824>Without even taking a pocketknife with them and paying no heed to the soldiers at the door, they burst into the magistrate's office.</t824> <t825>Don Apolinar Moscote did not lose his composure.</t825> <t826>He introduced them to his two daughters who were in the office at the time: sixteen-year-old Amparo, who was dark like her mother, and nine-year-old Remedios, who had lily-white skin and beautiful green eyes.</t826> <t827>The girls were graceful and well-mannered.</t827> <t828>As soon as the men entered, without waiting to be introduced, they ran to fetch chairs.</t828> <t829>But they themselves remained standing.</t829>
<t830>Jose Arcadio Buendia said, "Alright, my friend, you can stay here, but don't think that we are afraid of the armed bandits you posted at the door. We are keeping quiet out of respect for your wife and daughters."</t830>
<t831>Don Apolinar Moscote was taken aback, but Jose Arcadio Buendia did not give him a chance to speak.</t831> <t832>We have only two conditions, he continued, first, everyone will paint their house in the color they want.</t832> <t833>Second, the soldiers will leave immediately.</t833> <t834>We will ensure public order.</t834>
<t835>The magistrate raised his right hand, spreading all five fingers.</t835>
<t836>-Word of honor?</t836>
<t837>Jose Arcadio Buendia said, "Enemy words."</t837> <t838>And he added in a bitter tone: "Because never forget this: You and I are enemies."</t838>
<t839>The soldiers left before evening.</t839> <t840>A few days later, Jose Arcadio Buendia found a house for the judge's family.</t840> <t841>Everyone except Aureliano was content with their life.</t841> <t842>The thought of Remedios, the judge's young daughter who was almost young enough to be his own daughter, had left an unending ache in his heart.</t842> <t843>This was a tangible pain, like having a stone in your shoe that hurts as you walk.</t843>
<t844>The completion of the new house, as white as a dove's wing, was celebrated with a dance party.</t844> <t845>Ursula had thought of doing this on the day she first noticed that Hebeca and Amaranta had grown up and blossomed.</t845> <t846>The reconstruction of the house was actually intended to properly accommodate the suitors who would come and go for the girls.</t846> <t847>So that nothing would be lacking, she gathered her skirt at her waist and worked hard like a laborer in the house's renovation.</t847> <t848>Even before the craftsmen had finished their work, Ursula spared no expense to furnish the house from top to bottom, ordering a heap of items, bringing in tableware, and acquiring a new invention that left the entire village in awe and thrilled the young people: the Laterna.</t848> <t849>They brought the Laterna, disassembled and packed into several crates, along with the other items.</t849> <t850>The Viennese-style living room set, Bohemian crystals, tableware from the Indies company, Dutch-made tablecloths, and a host of candelabras, chandeliers, curtains, and covers entered the house along with the Laterna: The import company had also sent the Italian expert Pietro Crespi as a courtesy to assemble the Laterna, tune it, demonstrate how to use it, and teach how to dance to the latest fashionable music engraved on six paper strips.</t850>
<t851>Pietro Crespi was young and blonde.</t851> <t852>In Macondo, no man had ever been seen who was so handsome, so charming, and so well-mannered.</t852> <t853>He was also very particular about his attire.</t853> <t854>He never took off his embroidered waistcoat and dark jacket, even if he was melting from the heat and sweat.</t854> <t855>Maintaining a certain distance from the household and sweating profusely, he shut himself in the guest room for weeks, working with the same dedication that Aureliano had for his silver engravings.</t855> <t856>One morning, without opening the door or calling anyone to witness the miracle, he inserted the first strip into the lantern.</t856> <t857>The irritating sounds of hammers and saws suddenly ceased as those who were astonished by the orderly and smooth sound of the music dropped whatever they were holding.</t857> <t858>Everyone rushed to the living room.</t858>
<t859>Jose Arcadio Buendia was thunderstruck.</t859> <t860>His astonishment was not due to the beauty of the tune, but to the fact that the hurdy-gurdy operated on its own.</t860> <t861>Without wasting any time, Jose Arcadio set up Melquiades' camera in the hope of capturing a picture of the invisible hands playing this devilish invention.</t861> <t862>The Italian joined them at the table that day.</t862> <t863>Rebeca and Amaranta, who were serving at the table, watched in admiration as this angelic man used the cutlery with his ringless white hands with great finesse.</t863> <t864>In the sitting room adjacent to the parlor, Pietro Crespi was teaching them how to dance.</t864> <t865>He showed the girls how to move their feet without touching them, keeping time with a metronome under the friendly gaze of Ursula, who never left the room while they were taking lessons.</t865>
<t866>On the days they had lessons, Pietro Crespi wore special trousers made of tight and flexible fabric, and soft-soled shoes.</t866> <t867>Jose Arcadio Buendia would say to his wife, "Don't worry, dear."</t867> <t868>"This man is not a man, but a creature of the spirits."</t868> <t869>"He won't harm the girls."</t869> <t870>Nevertheless, Ursula remained cautious until the dance lessons ended and the Italian left Macondo.</t870> <t871>Then they began preparing for the party.</t871> <t872>Ursula made a list of those to be invited.</t872> <t873>Everyone descended from the founders of the village was invited to this party, except for the family of Pilar Ternera, who had recently given birth to two more children of unknown paternity: If friendship had not been the main criterion in the selection, there would have been no complaints about the invitation list.</t873> <t874>But those invited were not only the old friends of the Jose Arcadio Buendia family from before the great migration and the founding of Macondo; the sons and grandsons of these friends, who had been friends with Aureliano and Arcadio since childhood, and the daughters who embroidered with Rebeca and Amaranta were also included in the list.</t874> <t875>Even the name of kind-hearted Don Apolinar Moscote, who could do no more than support two policemen with wooden batons on his limited budget, was not mentioned.</t875>
<t876>To cover the household expenses, the girls had opened a tailor shop.</t876> <t877>At the same time, they were making and selling velvet flowers, guava pear sweets, and offering writing services for those who wanted love letters written.</t877> <t878>But no matter how much they were the most beautiful, most industrious, and most humble girls in the village, or how skillful they were in the new dances, they still couldn't manage to get invited to the party.</t878>
<t879>While Ursula and the girls were arranging the furniture that brought life back to the rooms crafted by the skillful hands of the builders, polishing the silver, and adorning the empty walls with beautiful girl pictures in boats filled with roses, Jose Arcadio Buendia, having firmly believed in God's absence and giving up on searching for Him, dismantled the lantern to uncover its magical secret.</t879> <t880>Two days before the party, even though he ended up with a bunch of extra screws, keys, and bolts, and the springs he wound in one direction unwound in another, he managed to reassemble the parts of the lantern.</t880> <t881>There had never been as much astonishment, hustle, and chaos as in those days.</t881> <t882>Still, the newly arrived chandeliers with arms were lit and prepared at the specified day and time of the invitation.</t882> <t883>The doors of the house, which still smelled of resin and whose whitewash had not yet dried, were opened, and the children and grandchildren of the village founders toured the terrace adorned with fern and begonia pots, the huge silent rooms, and the garden filled with the scent of roses.</t883> <t884>Then they gathered in the hall to see the unknown invention covered with a white sheet.</t884>
<t885>Those who had seen pianos in other villages of the marsh were disappointed when they saw this instrument that resembled a piano.</t885> <t886>But the disappointment of Ursula, who had set up the machine so that Amaranta and Rebeca could dance, was worse than all of theirs when the machine didn't work.</t886> <t887>Melquiades, who had become feeble and blind with age, tried to operate the machine using the skills of his infinite mind.</t887> <t888>Finally, while Jose Arcadio was fiddling with the organ grinder, he accidentally managed to set the jammed part in motion, and first a noise, then music in the form of mixed notes was heard.</t888> <t889>The keys striking the springs, which were tied backwards and not properly adjusted, eventually gave up.</t889> <t890>But the young people, descendants of the twenty-one brave souls who had dared to cross the mountains to the west in search of the sea, did not give up in front of this cacophony and the dance continued until morning.</t890>
<t891>Pietro Crespi came again to repair the lantern.</t891> <t892>Rebeca and Amaranta helped him with their smiles to arrange the springs and separate the tangled melodies.</t892> <t893>Their demeanor was so pleasant and innocent that eventually Ursula gave up waiting for them to come to their senses.</t893>
<t894>On the evening Pietro Crespi was to leave, a lantern party was organized in his honor, and Crespi demonstrated his mastery of modern dances with Rebeca.</t894> <t895>Arcadio and Amaranta were not falling behind them either.</t895> <t896>However, this beautiful show was interrupted; because Pilar Ternera, who was among those watching from the door, got into a hair-pulling fight with a woman who dared to say that Arcadio had a woman's buttocks.</t896> <t897>Towards midnight, Pietro Crespi bid farewell with a tearful speech, promising to return soon.</t897> <t898>Rebeca escorted him to the door.</t898> <t899>After closing the windows and doors and turning off the lights, she went up to her room and started crying.</t899> <t900>This endless crying, the reason for which even Amaranta did not know, lasted for days.</t900> <t901>Rebeca's introversion was not surprising.</t901> <t902>Despite appearing friendly and sincere, she was an introverted girl who never revealed what was in her heart to anyone.</t902>
<t903>Although she was a tall, sturdy-boned, healthy young girl, she could never give up the rocking chair she brought with her on her first arrival, which had been reinforced with nail upon nail for years and now had its arms broken off.</t903> <t904>Despite being a grown girl, no one knew that she hadn't given up the habit of sucking her finger.</t904> <t905>To hide this from everyone, she had made it a habit to lock herself in the bathroom frequently and to sleep with her face turned to the wall.</t905> <t906>On rainy afternoons, while sitting with her friends on the begonia-filled terrace doing embroidery, she would lose track of the conversation when her eyes fell on the mounds of earth raised by worms, and a tear loaded with homesickness would fall from the corner of her eye.</t906> <t907>The hidden tastes that had been conquered and forgotten years ago with oranges and jams surfaced with an irresistible force as soon as Rebeca began to cry.</t907> <t908>She started eating soil again.</t908> <t909>The first time, she ate the soil out of sheer curiosity because she saw disgust as the best remedy to prevent her mind from being swayed.</t909>
<t910>Indeed, the taste of soil in her mouth was disgusting at first.</t910> <t911>However, as curiosity gnawed at her insides, she too ate soil and gradually discovered the ancestral taste, savoring the pure flavors of basic nutrients.</t911> <t912>She filled her pockets with handfuls of soil; while teaching her friends the most difficult needlework, or talking about other men who weren't worth the sacrifice of eating wall plaster, she secretly ate soil with a passion mixed with pleasure and anger.</t912> <t913>When she ate soil, it felt as if the only person worth such degradation was closer, more tangible.</t913> <t914>The soil on which his delicate leather shoes stepped on the other side of the world, the mineral that left a bitter taste in her mouth after eating it, seemed to carry the warmth and density of his blood to Rebeca, giving her heart peace.</t914> <t915>One day, Amparo Moscote suddenly appeared and asked for permission to tour the house.</t915> <t916>Amaranta and Rebeca, stunned by this unexpected visit, welcomed Amparo with an icy formal demeanor.</t916> <t917>They showed her the repaired and renovated house, played the lantern, and offered orange marmalade with biscuits.</t917>
<t918>In the short time Ursula came to their side, Amparo quickly won her favor with her dignity, charm, and manners.</t918> <t919>After two hours had passed and a shortage of topics to talk about began, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta's distraction to slip a letter into Rebeca's hand.</t919> <t920>When Rebeca glanced at it, she saw the words "Dear Miss Rebeca Buendia" written in that pearl-like handwriting, with that green ink, and those meticulous words, explaining how to operate the lantern.</t920> <t921>She folded the letter with her fingertips, looked at Amparo Moscote with a gaze that promised eternal and unconditional gratitude and friendship until death, and tucked the letter into her chest.</t921>
<t922>The friendship that quickly solidified between Amparo Moscote and Rebeca Buendia rekindled Aureliano's hope.</t922> <t923>The memory of young Remedios had never ceased to haunt his mind, but Aureliano had not had the chance to see her.</t923> <t924>Whenever he went for a walk with his closest friends, Magnifico Visbal and Gerineldo Marquez—these young men shared the same names as their fathers, who were among the founders of the village—he would cast curious and furtive glances at the tailor's shop, only to see the girl's older sisters each time.</t924> <t925>The fact that Amparo Moscote had started coming and going from their house had kindled a spark of hope in his heart.</t925> <t926>She must come with her sister, he murmured to himself.</t926> <t927>She absolutely must come.</t927> <t928>As they say, if you say something forty times, it will come true, and Aureliano repeated this so earnestly and so tirelessly that one day, while he was trying to make a fish out of silver filigree, he suddenly felt as if the girl would come at any moment.</t928>
<t929>Indeed, shortly after, he heard that childish voice, and when he looked up and saw the girl standing at the door in her pink organza dress and white boots, his heart leapt to his throat.</t929>
<t930>Amparo Moscote, -You cannot enter Oraya.</t930> <t931>They are working, she was calling out from the hall.</t931>
<t932>Aureliano, without giving the girl a chance to respond, burst out.</t932> <t933>Holding the tiny fish by the chain coming out of its mouth, he said to the girl, Come inside.</t933>
<t934>Remedios approached and asked a lot of questions about the fish, which Aureliano couldn't answer because he was suddenly seized by an asthma attack.</t934> <t935>Aureliano thought, what more could he want than to spend the rest of his life beside this lily-skinned, emerald-eyed girl, who addressed him as "sir" with every question out of respect for her father.</t935> <t936>Melquiades was sitting in a corner, scribbling away with indecipherable codes.</t936> <t937>Aureliano suddenly hated him.</t937> <t938>All he could do was tell Remedios that he would give her the fish as a gift.</t938> <t939>The girl was so surprised and startled by this gift that she rushed outside the workshop.</t939> <t940>That day, Aureliano lost the patience he had while waiting for the days he eagerly watched for a chance to see Remedios.</t940> <t941>He neglected his work.</t941> <t942>As before, he waited with all his might, hoping the girl would come again, but Remedios did not appear.</t942>
<t943>He kept looking for the girl in his sisters' shop, at the window of their house, but he only found her in his imagination, which filled his unbearable loneliness.</t943> <t944>Aureliano would sit with Rebeca in the living room for hours, listening to the music box.</t944> <t945>Rebeca listened to the music box intently, because the music being played was the same that Pietro Crespi had taught them to dance to.</t945> <t946>Aureliano also listened to the music box intently, because everything, including the music, reminded him of Remedios.</t946>
<t947>The house was filled with love in every corner.</t947> <t948>Aureliano expressed his love with poems that had no beginning or end.</t948> <t949>He poured his love onto the coarse parchment papers given by Melquiades, wrote on his arms, scribbled poems on the bathroom walls, and in everything he wrote, Remedios appeared in various forms and sizes: In the heavy air at two in the afternoon that made everyone sleepy, there was Remedios; in the sweet scent of roses, Remedios; in the mystery of moths flocking to the light, Remedios; in the steam of freshly baked bread, again Remedios, always Remedios, everywhere Remedios.</t949> <t950>Rebeca would take her embroidery and sit by the window, waiting for her love to give a sign at four in the afternoon.</t950> <t951>She was well aware that the postman's mule came swaying every two weeks.</t951> <t952>Yet she always waited for him, believing that one day, unexpectedly, he would come.</t952>
<t953>But the exact opposite happened; one time, the mule did not appear on the usual day.</t953> <t954>Driven mad by despair, Rebeca rushed into the garden in the middle of the night, consumed by a desire to commit suicide, and ate handfuls of soil while crying out of pain and anger.</t954> <t955>She chewed on soft, slippery worms, crushing snail shells with her teeth.</t955> <t956>She vomited until dawn.</t956> <t957>Fever took over her head, she lost consciousness, and began to say whatever came to her mind without any sense of shame or sin.</t957> <t958>When Ursula heard the girl's ravings, she lost her mind, forced open Rebeca's chest, and at the bottom of the chest, she found exactly sixteen beautifully scented letters tied with pink ribbons, leaves and flowers hidden among old books, and dried butterflies that crumbled like dust upon touch.</t958>
<t959>Aureliano was the only person who could understand what such great despair meant.</t959> <t960>That afternoon, while Ursula was trying to bring Rebeca to her senses, Aureliano went to Catarino's shop with Magnifico Visbal and Gerineldo Marquez.</t960>
<t961>Additions were made to the shop over time, wooden rooms that smelled of faded flowers and were occupied by women with untied hair were added.</t961><t962>A tin jazz band consisting of an accordion and a drum was playing the songs of Devil-Breaker Francisco, who hadn't visited Macondo for a few years.</t962><t963>The three buddies got drunk on sugarcane juice.</t963><t964>Magnifico and Gerineldo, who were Aureliano's age but more experienced, had pulled a woman each onto their laps and were drinking continuously.</t964><t965>When the worn-out woman with gold teeth tried to caress Aureliano, he shivered from head to toe.</t965><t966>He pushed the woman away.</t966><t967>He realized that the more he drank, the more he remembered Remedios, but as he drank, he could better endure the pain brought by the memories.</t967><t968>He didn't know when his feet left the ground.</t968><t969>His friends and the women were flying in a bright void, floating in the air as if they had no weight.</t969><t970>They were uttering words that didn't come out of their mouths, making mysterious gestures that contradicted the expressions on their faces.</t970><t971>Catarino put his hand on his shoulder and said, "It's almost eleven o'clock."</t971><t972>Aureliano turned his head.</t972>
<t973>He saw Catarino's huge, misshapen face, the velvet flower tucked behind his ear, and the film broke.</t973> <t974>Just like during the period when they had sleeping sickness and forgot everything, everything in his mind was suddenly erased.</t974> <t975>Then he came to himself at an unknown hour in an unknown room.</t975> <t976>Pilar Ternera, in her undershirt, barefoot, her hair falling over her shoulders, stood there holding the lamp towards him, astonished in disbelief.</t976>
<t977>-Aureliano!</t977>
<t978>Aureliano gathered his feet and raised his head.</t978> <t979>He didn't know how he had come there, but he knew why he had come.</t979> <t980>Because he had nurtured and developed this passion deep in his heart since childhood.</t980>
<t981>-I came to sleep with you, she said.</t981>
<t982>His clothes were covered in mud and vomit.</t982> <t983>At that time, Pilar Ternera, who was living alone with her two small children, didn't ask him anything.</t983> <t984>She took Aureliano and brought him to bed.</t984> <t985>She wiped his face and eyes with a damp cloth, took off his clothes, then she herself stripped naked, and to prevent the children from seeing anything if they woke up, she lowered the mosquito net and got into bed.</t985> <t986>She was tired of waiting for a man who would stay for good, of men who left, and of countless men who lost their way to her house, and the inconsistency of the cards had confused her mind.</t986> <t987>During the years she spent waiting, her skin had wrinkled, her breasts had sagged, and the fire in her heart had extinguished.</t987> <t988>In the dark, she groped for Aureliano.</t988> <t989>She pressed her hand on his stomach and kissed his neck with maternal affection, murmuring, "Poor child."</t989> <t990>Aureliano shivered.</t990> <t991>With a silent, calm skillfulness, without making the slightest wrong move, he released all the pain that had accumulated inside him, and Remedios turned into an endless swamp smelling of wild animals and freshly ironed clothes within him.</t991>
<t992>Aureliano was crying when he surfaced from the mire.</t992> <t993>At first, he was sobbing uncontrollably, in short bursts.</t993> <t994>Then, as if something painful inside him had swollen and suddenly burst, he emptied out.</t994> <t995>The woman, scratching his head with her fingertips, patiently waited until he expelled the darkness consuming his life from his body.</t995> <t996>Then, she asked, "Who?"</t996> <t997>Aureliano told her who he was.</t997> <t998>Pilar Ternera, with her usual laughter that always startled the pigeons, this time laughed without waking even the children.</t998> <t999>"Are you going to be a nanny or a husband?" she mocked.</t999> <t1000>Still, Aureliano sensed a deep understanding beneath her mockery.</t1000> <t1001>As he left the room, freed not only from doubts about his manhood but also from the pain that had settled in his heart for months, Pilar Ternera spontaneously made him a promise.</t1001>
<t1002>"I will talk to the girl," he said.</t1002> <t1003>"Consider this job in the bag from now on."</t1003>
<t1004>He also kept his word.</t1004> <t1005>However, it coincided with a bad time; the old order and harmony at home were no longer there.</t1005> <t1006>When Rebeca's love fever, which could no longer be kept secret due to her shouting and yelling, was revealed, a fire also ignited in Amaranta's heart.</t1006> <t1007>She too was burning with the pain of a secret love.</t1007> <t1008>She would lock herself in the bathroom, pour her hopeless love into passionate letters, and then hide the letters at the bottom of her chest.</t1008> <t1009>Ursula was exhausted from dealing with the illness of the two girls who had fallen into bed.</t1009> <t1010>No matter what she did, she could not learn Amaranta's trouble.</t1010> <t1011>Finally, it came to her mind.</t1011> <t1012>This time, she went and rummaged through Amaranta's chest and found a stack of letters tied with a pink ribbon, written to Pietro Crespi but never sent, swollen by the lilies placed between them that had not yet dried, and wet with tears that had not yet dried.</t1012> <t1013>Crying with rage, she cursed the day she thought of becoming a laterna, banned the girls' embroidery lessons, and declared mourning until the girls lost all hope, even though there was no death in sight.</t1013>
<t1014>Jose Arcadio Buendia, who changed his initial negative impression of Pietro Crespi and admired his skill with musical instruments, also failed to calm his wife.</t1014> <t1015>Just at that moment, when Pilar Ternera informed Aureliano that Remedios was willing to marry, this event added fuel to the fire.</t1015> <t1016>Aureliano realized that bringing up this matter to his parents would only serve to upset them further.</t1016> <t1017>Jose Arcadio Buendia and Ursula, who were called to the living room to discuss a private and important matter, listened to their son's words without making a sound.</t1017>
<t1018>However, when Jose Arcadio Buendia heard the name of the prospective bride, he turned red and purple.</t1018> <t1019>Love is a terrible affliction, he shouted at the top of his lungs.</t1019> <t1020>With so many decent and honorable girls around, you choose to marry the daughter of our sworn enemy.</t1020> <t1021>Ursula, on the other hand, found this choice quite appropriate.</t1021> <t1022>She praised the beauty, manners, industriousness, and politeness of the Moscote sisters, saying she loved all seven of them, and congratulated her son.</t1022> <t1023>Seeing his wife's delight, Jose Arcadio Buendia saw no other way but to concede and put forth a condition: Since the man was also in favor, Pietro Crespi and Rebeca would also marry.</t1023> <t1024>Ursula would take Amaranta to the capital at the first opportunity; the different environment and different people would console the girl.</t1024>
<t1025>As soon as she heard the news, Rebeca's illness vanished.</t1025> <t1026>She sat down and wrote a letter to her fiancé, sharing the good news.</t1026> <t1027>After showing the letter to her parents and getting their approval, she mailed it herself without needing an intermediary.</t1027> <t1028>Amaranta seemed to accept the family's decision.</t1028> <t1029>In time, her health improved, but she swore that Rebeca would only marry over her dead body.</t1029>
<t1030>The following Saturday, Jose Arcadio Buendia dressed in his best clothes.</t1030> <t1031>He put on his navy blue suit, attached his cardboard collar, wore the deerskin boots he had worn on the night of the first party, and went to ask Remedios Moscote's father for her hand in marriage by God's command.</t1031> <t1032>The magistrate and his wife were both pleased and uneasy because they did not know the reason for this unexpected visit.</t1032> <t1033>After the reason for the visit was explained, they came to the conclusion that there was a mistake in the name of the prospective bride.</t1033> <t1034>To clear up this mistake, the woman woke Remedios from her sleep, took the drowsy child in her arms, and brought her.</t1034>
<t1035>They asked the girl whether her intention to marry was genuine, and she, half asleep and half awake, said that at that moment, all she wanted was to sleep.</t1035> <t1036>Understanding the concerns of the Moscotes, Jose Arcadio Buendia went to ask Aureliano about the truth of the matter.</t1036> <t1037>When he returned, the Moscotes were dressed up, had rearranged the chairs and sofas in the guest room, placed flowers in vases, and were waiting with their eldest daughters lined up beside them.</t1037> <t1038>Feeling uncomfortable both from the unpleasantness of the situation and the stiff collar that was choking him, Jose Arcadio Buendia confirmed that the prospective bride was indeed Remedios: Don Apolinar Moscote, too stunned to know what to say, remarked, Is this for real?</t1038> <t1039>We have six more daughters.</t1039> <t1040>And they are all of marriageable age, all single, and all would be delighted to become the wife of a sensible, hardworking young man like your son.</t1040>
<t1041>Aureliano, on the other hand, sets his eyes on someone who still wets their pants.</t1041> <t1042>His wife, a woman with sad eyes and a sad face, who remains steadfast even if the mosque collapses, immediately scolded her husband for his indiscretion.</t1042> <t1043>After drinking the fruit liqueur, they gladly accepted Aureliano's decision.</t1043> <t1044>Only, Senora Moscote said she wanted to speak with Ursula woman to woman.</t1044> <t1045>Grumbling about being involved in men's business with her dough-covered hands, but also feeling deeply moved, Ursula got up the next day and went to see Senora Moscote.</t1045> <t1046>Half an hour later, she returned with the news that Remedios was not yet of age.</t1046> <t1047>Aureliano did not see this as a serious obstacle at all.</t1047> <t1048>He had waited so long for his bride that he could wait until she came of age.</t1048>
<t1049>The newly established order at home was disrupted by Melquiades' death.</t1049> <t1050>Melquiades' death was not an unexpected event, but it happened under unexpected circumstances.</t1050> <t1051>A few months after his arrival, the poor man suddenly deteriorated so much that he quickly turned into a useless old grandfather who wandered like a shadow in the bedrooms, dragged his feet while walking, never stopped talking about the old days, and whose existence everyone forgot until he was found dead in his bed.</t1051> <t1052>In the beginning, Jose Arcadio Buendia, who had taken an interest in photography and Nostradamus' prophecies, was helping him.</t1052> <t1053>But as it became increasingly difficult for them to understand each other, Jose Arcadio also started to leave Melquiades alone.</t1053> <t1054>Melquiades had become blind and deaf.</t1054> <t1055>He confused the people he talked to with those he had known long ago, and answered questions with words formed from a mishmash of various languages.</t1055> <t1056>He wandered around breathing deeply, and although he moved among objects, he walked without touching anything as if he had an instinctive sense of direction.</t1056> <t1057>One day, he forgot to put on his dentures that he had placed in the glass of water by his bedside the night before; and then he never wore them again.</t1057>
<t1058>When Ursula decided to expand the house, she had Melquiades build a room next to Aureliano's workshop, away from the noise and commotion of the house.</t1058> <t1059>She had a window installed that let in plenty of light, had a bookshelf made, and personally cleaned and arranged on the shelves the books that were almost falling apart from dust and moths, the bundles of papers filled with scribbles, the glass holding his dentures and tiny yellow-flowered water plants rooting at the bottom.</t1059> <t1060>Melquiades must have liked his new place very much because he was never seen around again; he even stopped coming to the dining room.</t1060> <t1061>He only went to Aureliano's workshop and spent hours writing on the dry parchment papers that crumbled like starched cloth, which he brought with him.</t1061> <t1062>He also ate the meals that Visitacion brought him twice a day there.</t1062> <t1063>Recently, he had lost his appetite and had started eating nothing but vegetables.</t1063> <t1064>Soon, a sorrowful pallor, like that of vegetarians, settled on his face.</t1064> <t1065>His skin developed a thin layer of moss, like the old vest he never took off.</t1065> <t1066>His breath began to smell like that of sleeping animals.</t1066> <t1067>Aureliano, who was entirely absorbed in his rhyming, gradually forgot about him.</t1067>
<t1068>Only once did something comprehensible come to his ears from Melquiades' endless monologues, and he listened.</t1068> <t1069>In fact, the only thing that could be gleaned from Melquiades' mumblings was the constantly repeated word equinox, equinox, equinox, and the name Alexander von Humboldt.</t1069> <t1070>When Arcadio began to help Aureliano with his silver work, he got a bit closer to Melquiades.</t1070> <t1071>Melquiades responded to his attempts to get closer with nonsensical answers in Spanish.</t1071> <t1072>But one day, on an overly emotional evening, the clouds enveloping his brain seemed to part for a moment.</t1072> <t1073>Years later, as Arcadio stood before the firing squad, he would remember the shiver he felt on the day Melquiades sat him down and read a few pages of writings that he didn't understand but which sounded like sacred commands when read aloud.</t1073>
<t1074>After Melquiades finished reading, he smiled for the first time in a long while and spoke in Spanish: When I die, boil mercury in my room for three days, Arcadio, he hinted these to Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t1074> <t1075>Although he tried to learn something more detailed; he could not get any words from Melquiades other than, I have attained the secret of immortality.</t1075>
<t1076>When Melquiades' breath started to smell bad, Arcadio began taking him to the river on Thursday mornings.</t1076> <t1077>Bathing seemed to do him good.</t1077> <t1078>Melquiades would undress and dive into the water with the young men.</t1078> <t1079>With that mysterious sense of direction, he stayed away from deep and dangerous places.</t1079> <t1080>Once he said, "We are originally water.</t1080> <t1081>We all originated from water," he said.</t1081> <t1082>This went on for a long time.</t1082> <t1083>Other than the night of the party where he made a pitiful effort to operate the lantern, and the days he went to the river with Arcadio, carrying a gourd, a towel, and almond oil soap under his arm, no one saw him.</t1083>
<t1084>One Thursday morning, when Aureliano went to take him to the river, he heard him say, "I died of fever on the beaches of Singapore."</t1084> <t1085>That day, Melquiades dove into a place in the water where he shouldn't have, and he never came back up.</t1085> <t1086>They found his body only the next day, several miles away.</t1086>
<t1087>The current had made a bend there and thrown him ashore.</t1087> <t1088>When they found him, a vulture was perched on his belly.</t1088> <t1089>Despite all of Ursula's resistance, who had not shed so many tears even when her own father died, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not allow Melquiades to be buried.</t1089> <t1090>He kept saying that Melquiades was immortal and that he himself had revealed the secret of resurrection after death.</t1090> <t1091>He brought out an alembic that had been forgotten in a corner and placed the pot of boiling mercury, bubbling with blue bubbles, next to the corpse.</t1091> <t1092>Don Apolinar Moscote dared to remind him that keeping a drowned person unburied was harmful to public health.</t1092> <t1093>Jose Arcadio Buendia, saying, "You are mistaken, sir, because he is alive," boiled the mercury burner for exactly seventy-two hours until the corpse shone brightly and seemed about to explode, and a pestilent odor filled the house.</t1093> <t1094>Only after seventy-two hours had passed did he allow them to bury him, and not haphazardly, but with a grand funeral that could be conceived for the greatest man of Macondo.</t1094> <t1095>It was the first and most crowded funeral in the village.</t1095> <t1096>A more grandiose one would only be seen a century later at the funeral procession of the Great-Grandmother.</t1096> <t1097>They buried him in a pit dug in the middle of the area they had designated as the cemetery.</t1097> <t1098>They placed a stone at his head and wrote the only thing they knew about him: MELQUIADES.</t1098>
<t1099>They kept vigil for nine nights.</t1099> <t1100>Taking advantage of the chaos created by the crowd that gathered in the garden to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play cards, Amaranta found an opportunity to declare her love to Pietro Crespi.</t1100> <t1101>A few weeks earlier, Pietro Crespi had formalized the promise he made to Rebeca, and opened a shop selling musical instruments and mechanical toys in a place where Arabs used to trade trinkets with parrot monstrosities and villagers called Turkish Street.</t1101> <t1102>The handsome Italian, whose head adorned with shiny curls made every woman's heart skip a beat, treated Amaranta as if she were a spoiled child not worth taking seriously.</t1102>
<t1103>"I have a little brother," he said.</t1103> <t1104>"He will come to help me in the shop."</t1104>
<t1105>Amaranta was very offended by these words, felt humiliated, and said with great anger that she was ready to prevent her sister's marriage even at the cost of her own life.</t1105> <t1106>The dramatic aspect of this threat affected the Italian so much that he went and told Rebeca about it.</t1106> <t1107>Thus, Amaranta's trip, which had been continuously postponed due to Ursula's busyness, was carried out within a week.</t1107> <t1108>Amaranta did not say a word, but did not refrain from whispering in Rebeca's ear while kissing her goodbye:</t1108>
<t1109>-Don't get your hopes up for nothing.</t1109> <t1110>Even if they send me to the other end of the world, I will find a way to stop you from getting married, even if it means not killing you.</t1110>
<t1111>On one hand, the absence of Ursula, and on the other, the invisible presence of Melquiades wandering through the rooms dragging his feet, turned the house into a vast, empty ruin.</t1111><t1112>Rebeca managed the house, and the Indian woman ran the oven.</t1112><t1113>At twilight, when Pietro Crespi arrived with the heartwarming scent of lavender and the gift toys he never failed to bring, his fiancée would take him to the guest room, opening all the doors and windows wide so no one would think ill of them.</t1113><t1114>This was an unnecessary precaution, as the Italian had shown himself to be so measured and respectful that he wouldn't even touch the hand of the girl who would become his wife within a year.</t1114><t1115>Crespi's visits filled the house with beautiful toys.</t1115><t1116>Dancing ballerinas when wound up, musical boxes that played by themselves, monkeys that jumped and somersaulted, galloping horses, tambourine-playing clowns, and many more.</t1116><t1117>The various, mind-boggling toy animals brought by Pietro Crespi pulled Jose Arcadio Buendia out of the sorrow he felt from Melquiades' death and returned him to his old days of fascination with alchemy.</t1117><t1118>For a while, he spent his time in a world of gutted animals, trying to perfect them by dismantling their mechanisms and turning them into perpetual motion machines using pendulum principles.</t1118><t1119>As for Aureliano, he stopped doing any work, claiming he was teaching Remedios to read and write.</t1119><t1120>At first, the child didn't want to leave her toys and preferred her dolls over washing and dressing up to wait in the guest room for this man who moved into their house every day.</t1120><t1121>However, Aureliano's patience and passion eventually prevailed, and the little girl began to sit for hours learning the alphabet, drawing pictures of houses with cows in the barn with colored pencils, and round suns with yellow rays stretching beyond the hills.</t1121>
<t1122>The only one who was not happy was Rebeca, and that was because of Amaranta's intimidation.</t1122> <t1123>She knew her sister's temperament, how proud she was, and she was frightened by the intensity of her anger.</t1123> <t1124>She would lock herself in the bathroom for hours, sucking her finger, using her iron willpower to stop herself from eating dirt.</t1124> <t1125>In the anxiety of not knowing what would happen, she had Pilar Ternera read her fortune to ease her heart.</t1125> <t1126>After Pilar Ternera spouted a bunch of cliché phrases, she finally said what she had to say:</t1126>
<t1127>-Until your parents are buried, you will not be happy.</t1127>
<t1128>Rebeca shivered from head to toe.</t1128> <t1129>As if she were dreaming, she recalled arriving at this house as a tiny girl with her trunk, her rocking chair, and a bag whose contents she never knew.</t1129> <t1130>A bald man, who didn't resemble the king of cups at all, with a linen outfit and a collar fastened with a gold button, came to her mind.</t1130> <t1131>Then, a very young, very beautiful woman who had nothing to do with the diamond leg and his trembling hands came to her mind.</t1131> <t1132>This woman's hands were warm and fragrant, and she would adorn Rebeca's hair with flowers and take her around a city with paths lined with greenery.</t1132>
<t1133>"I didn't understand anything," he said.</t1133>
<t1134>Pilar Ternera was surprised.</t1134>
<t1135>-I didn't understand either.</t1135> <t1136>But the papers say so.</t1136>
<t1137>This event stuck in Rebeca's mind so much that she went and told Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t1137> <t1138>Since Jose Arcadio Buendia believed in omens, he scolded her thoroughly, but at the same time, without letting anyone notice, he started rummaging through cupboards and chests, turning things upside down, lifting mattresses and bedding, even prying up floorboards to search for the bag of bones.</t1138> <t1139>He remembered that he hadn't seen the bag since the house was repaired.</t1139> <t1140>He secretly questioned the builders.</t1140> <t1141>Finally, one of them said that he had walled up the bag in one of the bedrooms because it was getting in his way.</t1141> <t1142>For days, they went from room to room, pressing their ears to the walls, wandering around the house until they heard that familiar rattling sound from deep within.</t1142> <t1143>They immediately broke through the wall.</t1143> <t1144>The bag of bones was there, untouched.</t1144> <t1145>They buried the bag next to Melquiades' grave that very day.</t1145> <t1146>They didn't even put a stone on it.</t1146> <t1147>Jose Arcadio Buendia returned home, feeling momentarily relieved of a burden that had troubled his conscience as much as the memory of Prudencio Aguilar.</t1147> <t1148>As he passed through the kitchen, he kissed Rebeca on the forehead.</t1148>
<t1149>"Get rid of those negative thoughts," he said.</t1149> <t1150>"You will be happy."</t1150>
<t1151>Her friendship with Rebeca reopened the door that Ursula had shut in Pilar Ternera's face since Arcadio's birth.</t1151> <t1152>She would drop by the house at any hour like a stray herd of goats, using her inexhaustible energy for the heaviest tasks.</t1152> <t1153>Sometimes she would go to the workshop and help Arcadio with his painting sheets.</t1153> <t1154>And her hands were so skillful that her dexterity astonished Arcadio.</t1154> <t1155>This woman made him restless.</t1155> <t1156>The burnt darkness of her skin, her smoky scent, and her laughter that shook the dark room caught the young man's attention, making him lose his composure.</t1156>
<t1157>Once, while Aureliano was working on his silver crafts, Pilar Ternera leaned on the table to admire his patient meticulousness: That was when it happened.</t1157> <t1158>Before Aureliano lifted his head and looked into Pilar Ternera's eyes, whose thoughts were as clear as day, he carefully checked to see if Arcadio was in the dark room.</t1158>
<t1159>Then, he said, "Spit it out, what's on your mind."</t1159>
<t1160>Pilar Ternera bit her lips with a pained smile.</t1160>
<t1161>"You would make a good soldier," he said.</t1161> <t1162>"The bullets you fire don't go to waste."</t1162>
<t1163>Aureliano, when he sensed the truth of the prophecy, took a deep breath of relief.</t1163> <t1164>He continued his work as if nothing had happened.</t1164> <t1165>A peaceful, confident strength came into his voice.</t1165>
<t1166>"I will recognize the child," he said.</t1166> <t1167>"He will carry my name."</t1167>
<t1168>Jose Arcadio Buendia finally achieved his goal.</t1168> <t1169>He connected the clockwork mechanism to a ballerina, and the toy danced to its own rhythm for three days and three nights.</t1169> <t1170>This invention captivated his mind more than all his other absurd pursuits.</t1170> <t1171>He stopped eating and drinking.</t1171> <t1172>He couldn't sleep.</t1172> <t1173>Only Rebeca's care and affection kept him from falling into a madness from which he could never recover.</t1173> <t1174>He paced his room, thinking out loud until dawn, searching for ways to apply the law of the pendulum to anything that could be made useful by movement, such as carts and rakes.</t1174> <t1175>His sleeplessness had weakened and exhausted him so much that he did not recognize the white-haired, shaky man who entered his room at dawn.</t1175> <t1176>It was Prudencio Aguilar.</t1176> <t1177>When Jose Arcadio Buendia finally realized who he was, he shivered with a homesick longing, surprised that even the dead could age.</t1177> <t1178>Prudencio! he cried out.</t1178> <t1179>How far you have come!</t1179> <t1180>After so many years of death, the longing for the living was so intense, the desire to exchange a few words so great, and the proximity of the other death within death so terrifying that Prudencio Aguilar had finally come to love his mortal enemy.</t1180> <t1181>He had searched for him for years.</t1181> <t1182>He had asked the dead coming from Riohacha, he had asked the dead coming from the Upar Valley, he had asked the dead coming from the swamp.</t1182> <t1183>He had received no news, because until Melquiades came and marked it as a tiny dot on the maps of death, Macondo was unknown in the land of the dead.</t1183> <t1184>Jose Arcadio Buendia talked with Prudencio Aguilar until dawn.</t1184> <t1185>A few hours later, exhausted from sleeplessness, he went to Aureliano's workshop and asked, What day is it today?</t1185>
<t1186>Aureliano said it was Tuesday.</t1186> <t1187>Jose Arcadio Buendia said, I thought so too, but then I realized that it's still not Monday like yesterday.</t1187> <t1188>Look at the sky, look at the walls, today is also Monday.</t1188> <t1189>Aureliano, who was used to his eccentricities, didn't pay any attention.</t1189> <t1190>The next day, which was Wednesday, Jose Arcadio Buendia entered the workshop again.</t1190> <t1191>This is a disaster, he said.</t1191> <t1192>Look at the weather, listen to the buzzing of the sun, everything is just like yesterday and the day before.</t1192> <t1193>Today is also Monday.</t1193> <t1194>That night, Pietro Crespi found him on the terrace, crying for Prudencio Aguilar, for Melquiades, for Rebeca's parents, for his own parents, for everyone he knew who was now facing death.</t1194> <t1195>Even though Crespi gave him a toy bear that walked on its hind legs and performed tricks on a rope, he couldn't free Jose Arcadio Buendia from his obsession: He asked about the status of the pendulum mechanism he had described a few days ago, which was supposed to help people fly.</t1195> <t1196>Buendia said it couldn't be done because the pendulum could lift everything into the air, but there was no way it could lift itself.</t1196>
<t1197>On Thursday, with a face wrinkled from pain like freshly plowed soil, he went back to the workshop.</t1197> <t1198>He would cry if someone touched him.</t1198> <t1199>"The time machine is broken," he said, almost sobbing.</t1199> <t1200>And Ursula and Amaranta are so far away!</t1200> <t1201>Aureliano scolded him as if reprimanding a child.</t1201> <t1202>Upon this, Buendia adopted an attitude as if he regretted what he had done.</t1202> <t1203>He examined his surroundings for six hours without rest; he struggled to find a change that would prove the passage of time.</t1203>
<t1204>He spent the whole night in his bed without blinking, calling out to Prudencio Aguilar, Melquiades, and all the dead, inviting them to share his pain.</t1204> <t1205>But no one came.</t1205> <t1206>On Friday, he went outside before anyone woke up; he watched nature until he was completely convinced that it was Monday.</t1206> <t1207>Then, grabbing the iron door handle, with the full crushing force of his unprecedented strength, he smashed everything in the alchemy laboratory, the photo studio, and the silver workshop to pieces.</t1207>
<t1208>On the one hand, he was shouting something in a high-pitched and incomprehensible language.</t1208> <t1209>Aureliano saw that things were getting out of hand and that if he let it go, his father would destroy the house, so he asked for help from the neighbors.</t1209> <t1210>It took ten people to bring Jose Arcadio to the ground, fourteen people to tie his hands and feet, and twenty people to drag him to the chestnut tree in the garden.</t1210> <t1211>When they tied him to the tree and left him, he was shouting something in an unknown language, and green foam was coming out of his mouth.</t1211> <t1212>When Ursula and Amaranta returned, Jose Arcadio Buendia was tied to the chestnut tree by his hands and feet: he was soaking wet from the rain and had completely lost his mind.</t1212> <t1213>Ursula and Amaranta tried to talk to him.</t1213> <t1214>He did not recognize them and said something in a language they did not understand.</t1214> <t1215>Ursula untied his wrists and feet, which had been cut by the ropes.</t1215> <t1216>She left only his waist tied.</t1216> <t1217>Later on, they made a shelter out of palm leaves to protect him from the sun and rain.</t1217>
<t1218>Aureliano Buendia and Remedios Moscote entered into matrimony on a Sunday in March, in front of the altar set up in the guest room by Father Nicanor Reyna.</t1218> <t1219>Thus concluded the stormy four weeks that had turned the Moscote family upside down due to Remedios' transition to adolescence without abandoning her childhood habits.</t1219> <t1220>Her mother had sat her down and explained at length how to transition to young womanhood, but still, one day in February, while Aureliano was sitting and chatting with his sisters-in-law, Remedios had burst into the room, showing her underwear stained with a chocolate-colored liquid.</t1220> <t1221>It was decided that the wedding would take place one month from that date.</t1221> <t1222>During this time, the household was at their wits' end trying to teach Remedios to bathe herself, dress herself, and manage some basic household chores.</t1222>
<t1223>They heated up bricks and placed them under him to make him stop wetting his pants.</t1223> <t1224>It took a lot of effort to make her understand that she shouldn't talk to anyone about the privacy of a married couple, because Remedios was so bewildered and confused by what her mother had taught her that she wanted to tell everyone about what would happen on her wedding night.</t1224> <t1225>Preparing the girl for marriage was not a task that just anyone could handle.</t1225> <t1226>Still, by the time the wedding day arrived, the girl had become at least as aware as her older sisters.</t1226> <t1227>Don Apolinar Moscote took his daughter by the arm and began to walk down the street adorned with flowers and wreaths, where several brass bands were lined up along the way, amidst the noise of fireworks being set off here and there.</t1227>
<t1228>Gelin, pencerelerden sarkan, kendisine iyi dileklerde bulunan konu komşuya gülümseyerek el sallıyordu.</t1228> <t1229>Tepeden tırnağa siyahlar giyinmiş, ayaklarına da birkaç yıl sonra idam mangasının önüne çıkarken de giyeceği parlak deri çizmeleri çekmiş olan Aureliano'nun benzi, kül gibiydi.</t1229> <t1230>Evin kapısında gelini karşılayıp mihrabın önüne götürürken boğazına bir düğüm takıldı.</t1230> <t1231>Remedios öyle kendine güvenli bir tavırdaydı ki, Aureliano yüzüğü parmağına takayım derken düşürünce bile hiç istifini bozmadı.</t1231> <t1232>Konukların şaşkınlığına, salonu bir anda dolduran fısıltılara aldırmadan, damat bey, yüzüğü tam kapıdan dışarı yuvarlanacağı sırada ayağıyla durdurup kan ter içinde mihrabın önüne gelinceye dek, Remedios, dantel eldivenli yüzüksüz elini havada hazır bekletti.</t1232> <t1233>Annesiyle ablaları tören sırasında kızın bir densizlik yapmasından öylesine korkuyorlardı ki, gelin bu işin içinden yüzünün akıyla çıkınca, kendilerini tutamayıp kucakladıkları gibi öpücüklere boğdular onu.</t1233>
<t1234>Remedios's sense of responsibility, grace, delicacy, and ability to remain calm in difficult situations showed itself even from that day.</t1234> <t1235>It was she who thought on her own to put the largest slice of the wedding cake on a plate and bring it along with a fork to Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t1235> <t1236>The large man, tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree, huddled on the wooden bench under the palm shade, his color faded from the sun and rain, smiled faintly as if to thank her and mumbled an incomprehensible prayer while gobbling down the cake with his hands.</t1236> <t1237>The only hopeless person at the wedding, which lasted with music and dancing until Monday morning, was Rebeca Buendia.</t1237> <t1238>It was her darkest day.</t1238> <t1239>Ursula had planned to marry her off on the same day.</t1239> <t1240>However, on Friday, a letter arrived for Pietro Crespi, informing him that his mother was on her deathbed.</t1240> <t1241>As a result, the wedding was postponed.</t1241>
<t1242>Pietro Crespi departed for the capital one hour after receiving the news of the death.</t1242> <t1243>Mother and son passed by each other in opposite directions without noticing, the woman arrived home at the expected hour on Saturday evening and sang the sorrowful aria she had prepared for her son's wedding at Aureliano's wedding.</t1243> <t1244>Having exhausted five horses to make it to his own wedding on time, Pietro Crespi found, upon his return on Sunday night, that the wedding festivities had ended, leaving only remnants behind.</t1244> <t1245>It was never discovered who wrote the letter.</t1245> <t1246>Ursula cornered Amaranta, but the girl swore her innocence in front of the altar that the carpenters had yet to dismantle.</t1246>
<t1247>Father Nicanor Reyna, whom Don Apolinar Moscote brought from the swamp to conduct his wedding ceremony, was an old man hardened by the ingratitude of his profession.</t1247> <t1248>His skin was so pale it seemed as if his bones were about to burst out from within.</t1248> <t1249>He had a round belly and an angelic expression on his face that stemmed more from simplicity than goodness.</t1249> <t1250>After the wedding, he intended to return to his homeland.</t1250> <t1251>However, when he saw that the people of Macondo had shelved both virtue and sin, forgotten what baptism and feast days were, his heart could not bear such depravity.</t1251>
<t1252>Believing that there could be no place more in need of God's love and fear, and that no more virgin soil could be found to sow God's seed, he decided to stay another week, to baptize anyone circumcised or uncircumcised, to marry long-time couples before God, and to pray over the dead.</t1252> <t1253>But no one paid any attention.</t1253> <t1254>Whoever he approached, they said that they had managed just fine without a priest for all these years, and that they conducted their affairs with God without any intermediaries for their souls.</t1254> <t1255>When Father Nicanor grew tired of going from street to street preaching, he thought of building a church.</t1255>
<t1256>This was going to be a church like no other in the world, adorned with stained glass on both sides, featuring life-sized depictions of saints, and people would travel all the way from Rome to this land of non-believers to find their God.</t1256> <t1257>He took a copper bowl in his hand and went out to collect donations.</t1257> <t1258>Everyone was giving generously from their hearts, and what was given was not insignificant at all, but it was impossible to satisfy the holy father's greed.</t1258> <t1259>He said it had to be a bell strong enough to bring the drowned to the surface and loud enough to make an impact wherever it struck.</t1259> <t1260>His voice became hoarse from pleading, and he could no longer speak.</t1260> <t1261>When he couldn't express his voice outwardly, it spread inwardly, and his bones and marrow began to resonate.</t1261> <t1262>On a Saturday when he couldn't even gather enough money for the doors, he went mad with despair, not knowing what to do, he set up a pulpit in the middle of the village, and on Sunday, like in the days of his insomnia, he took a rattle in his hand and called everyone, whether they heard or not, to an open-air mass.</t1262> <t1263>Most went out of curiosity.</t1263> <t1264>Some went out of longing for the old days, and some so that God wouldn't consider ignoring His messenger an insult to Himself.</t1264> <t1265>Thus, at eight in the morning, half the village gathered in the square and listened to the sermon given by Father Nicanor, whose voice was hoarse from begging.</t1265> <t1266>Finally, as the gathered crowd began to slowly disperse, Father Nicanor raised his arms as if to indicate he was about to say something important.</t1266>
<t1267>"Wait a minute," he said.</t1267> <t1268>"Now we will witness an indisputable proof of God's infinite power."</t1268>
<t1269>During the ceremony, the child who was helping him brought a cup of dark cocoa with steam rising from it.</t1269> <t1270>Father Nicanor finished the cocoa in one gulp.</t1270> <t1271>He wiped his mouth with the handkerchief he took out from the sleeve of his robe, opened his arms wide, and closed his eyes.</t1271> <t1272>And Father Nicanor suddenly rose about fifteen centimeters off the ground.</t1272> <t1273>There could be no more convincing proof of God's greatness.</t1273> <t1274>After going door to door for a few more days and downing hot cocoa, he repeated this flying trick.</t1274> <t1275>When the bag in the sacristan boy's hand was stuffed full, he started the construction of the church within a month.</t1275> <t1276>No one doubted that God's hand was in the priest's flying, except for Jose Arcadio Buendia, who watched the crowd gathered around the chestnut tree to see the flying demonstration again without moving a muscle.</t1276> <t1277>When Father Nicanor began to lift his feet off the ground along with the chair he was sitting on, Jose Arcadio Buendia did nothing but spread out a little more on the wooden bench and shrug his shoulders.</t1277>
<t1278>Then I said, "Hoc est simplicissimus."</t1278> <t1279>This man discovered the fourth state of matter.</t1279>
<t1280>Peder Nicanor raised his hands in the air and the four legs of the chair touched the ground at the same time.</t1280>
<t1281>"No," he replied.</t1281> <t1282>"This fact undoubtedly proves the existence of God."</t1282>
<t1283>Thus, it was understood that the hocus-pocus spoken by Jose Arcadio Buendia was Latin.</t1283> <t1284>Father Nicanor, taking advantage of being the only person who could communicate with him, tried to inject the belief in God into his deranged mind: Now, he went to the chestnut tree every day, preaching in Latin.</t1284> <t1285>However, Jose Arcadio Buendia paid no attention to the babble, did not care about the cocoa miracle, and insisted that he wanted a photograph of God as the only proof.</t1285>
<t1286>Upon this, Father Nicanor brought medallions, icons, and even a Veronica handkerchief.</t1286> <t1287>But Jose Arcadio Buendia did not accept them, saying they were artistic things without a scientific basis.</t1287> <t1288>He was so adamant that in the end, Father Nicanor gave up trying to call him to the righteous path and continued to visit him purely out of human compassion.</t1288> <t1289>But then Jose Arcadio Buendia rolled up his sleeves and tried to undermine the priest's faith by trapping him in logical dilemmas.</t1289> <t1290>One day, Father Nicanor brought a chess set under the chestnut tree and invited Jose Arcadio to play.</t1290> <t1291>Jose Arcadio Buendia did not respond to this invitation, saying that there was no point in playing a game according to pre-agreed rules.</t1291> <t1292>Having never seen chess played without rules, Father Nicanor never mentioned chess again.</t1292> <t1293>Astonished by Jose Arcadio Buendia's rational conversation, he asked how they had managed to tie him to the tree.</t1293>
<t1294>This is the simplest, replied Jose Arcadio Buendia, I'm crazy, that's why.</t1294>
<t1295>After that day, the priest, who began to doubt his own faith, never went to him again and dedicated himself to the construction of the church.</t1295> <t1296>Rebeca's hopes were rekindled.</t1296> <t1297>The future now depended on the construction of the church.</t1297> <t1298>Because one Sunday, when Father Nicanor came to eat with them and the family sat down at the table, while they were talking about the magnificent masses and ceremonies that would be held after the church was built, Amaranta said, "The luckiest of us will be Rebeca."</t1298> <t1299>When Rebeca didn't understand what she meant, she explained with a naive smile:</t1299>
<t1300>-You are the one who will celebrate the completion of the church with your wedding.</t1300>
<t1301>Rebeca wanted to close the subject immediately.</t1301> <t1302>At this rate, the church wouldn't be finished for another ten years.</t1302> <t1303>However, Father Nicanor didn't think so at all.</t1303> <t1304>The generosity of charitable citizens led him to optimistic calculations.</t1304> <t1305>Despite Rebeca's silent anger, who had a lump in her throat, Ursula found Amaranta's idea quite reasonable and made a considerable donation to speed up the construction.</t1305> <t1306>According to Father Nicanor, if there were another donation like this, the church would be finished in less than three years.</t1306> <t1307>Believing that Amaranta's intentions were not as pure as they seemed, Rebeca never spoke to her again.</t1307> <t1308>That night, while they were arguing, Amaranta said, This was the mildest, most harmless thing I could do.</t1308> <t1309>At least this way, I won't have to kill you for another three years.</t1309> <t1310>Rebeca accepted this challenge of hers.</t1310>
<t1311>Pietro Crespi was devastated when he heard that their wedding had been postponed again.</t1311> <t1312>Rebeca encouraged him by proving her loyalty once more.</t1312> <t1313>"If you want, we can elope," she said.</t1313> <t1314>But Pietro Crespi was not the kind of man to jump into an adventure with his eyes closed.</t1314> <t1315>He didn't have a trace of his fiancée's boldness.</t1315> <t1316>Respecting a given word was his most valuable treasure.</t1316> <t1317>Upon this, Rebeca began to employ bolder methods.</t1317> <t1318>Once, when a gust of wind from an unknown source extinguished the lamps in the guest room, Ursula caught the two lovers kissing in the dark.</t1318> <t1319>Pietro Crespi was flustered, complained that these newfangled lamps were useless, and even helped Ursula to equip the room with a more reliable lighting system.</t1319> <t1320>But whether it was due to the poor quality of the kerosene or defective wicks, the lamps went out again, and this time Ursula caught Rebeca in her fiancé's lap.</t1320> <t1321>There was no more room for excuses.</t1321> <t1322>She dumped the bakery work on the Indian woman and, to prevent the usual tricks she herself had once played on her own mother, sat in the rocking chair and watched them until Crespi left.</t1322> <t1323>Seeing Ursula yawn from boredom, Rebeca would pretend to be angry and say, "Poor mother, she'll go to heaven with this rocking chair when she dies."</t1323> <t1324>In the third month of their supervised courtship, tired of the lack of progress in the construction, Pietro Crespi decided to give Father Nicanor the money needed to complete the church.</t1324> <t1325>Amaranta was not worried at all.</t1325> <t1326>Every day, she sat on the terrace with her friends, embroidering, talking with them, and devising new tricks.</t1326> <t1327>The trick she thought would be most effective was foiled by a miscalculation: Amaranta removed the mothballs from Rebeca's wedding dress, which was stored in the console in her bedroom.</t1327> <t1328>There were two months left until the church was completed.</t1328>
<t1329>However, the plan didn't go as expected, and with the wedding approaching, an increasingly impatient Rebeca decided to start preparing her wedding dress earlier than Amaranta had anticipated.</t1329> <t1330>When she pulled out the drawer and opened the papers and then the bundle, she saw that moths had riddled the dress, the veil's threads, and even the bridal crown made of orange blossoms with holes.</t1330> <t1331>She had no doubt that she had put handfuls of mothballs into the bundle, but this disaster was so typical that she couldn't bring herself to blame Amaranta.</t1331> <t1332>There was less than a month left until the wedding.</t1332> <t1333>Fortunately, Amparo Moscote promised to have a new wedding dress ready within a week.</t1333> <t1334>On that rainy afternoon when Amparo came to do Rebeca's final fitting, Amaranta almost fainted.</t1334>
<t1335>Her breath was cut off, and cold sweat ran down her back.</t1335> <t1336>For months, she had been waiting in fear for that moment to arrive.</t1336> <t1337>Because if the last resort to prevent Rebeca from getting married failed, she had no doubt that she would dare to poison her at the last moment.</t1337> <t1338>That day, while Rebeca, wrapped in the fabric armor that Amparo had wound around her body with thousands of pins and infinite patience, stood breathless from the heat, Amaranta lost track of her work, embroidered incorrectly, pricked her finger with a needle, but with a terrifying calmness decided that the last day would be the Friday before the wedding.</t1338> <t1339>She would poison Rebeca with the spirit of opium she would add to her coffee.</t1339>
<t1340>An unexpected and unsolvable new obstacle postponed the wedding once more and indefinitely.</t1340> <t1341>A week before the wedding day, little bride Remedios woke up in the middle of the night, submerged in the warmth of water that burst with a pain as if something was being torn from inside her.</t1341> <t1342>Three days later, she passed away from blood poisoning along with the twins lying head to toe in her womb.</t1342> <t1343>Amaranta was writhing in guilt.</t1343> <t1344>She had prayed so fervently for a terrible event to occur so that she wouldn't have to poison Rebeca, that she blamed herself for Remedios' death.</t1344> <t1345>This was not the obstacle she had desperately awaited.</t1345> <t1346>Remedios had brought joy to the house.</t1346> <t1347>She had decorated a room near the workshop with dolls and toys from her recent childhood and settled there with her husband.</t1347> <t1348>Her cheerful and lively spirit transcended the four walls of the bedroom and had become like a breeze of health on the begonia terrace.</t1348> <t1349>She would start singing at dawn.</t1349> <t1350>She was the only one who dared to intervene in the fights between Rebeca and Amaranta.</t1350>
<t1351>He had also taken care of Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t1351> <t1352>He would bring him his food, help him with his daily needs, wash and brush his hands and face, pick out the lice and fleas from his hair and beard, and if the weather turned bad, he would reinforce the shelter made of palm leaves with a canvas.</t1352> <t1353>In recent months, he had picked up Latin and had even started to speak broken Latin with Jose Arcadio.</t1353> <t1354>When Pilar Ternera's son, born of Aureliano, was brought home and baptized with the name Aureliano Jose in a ceremony held among the family, Remedios decided to embrace him as her first child.</t1354> <t1355>Her maternal instinct surprised Ursula.</t1355> <t1356>As for Aureliano, the sole meaning and purpose of his life had become his wife: He worked in his workshop all day, and around noon, Remedios would bring him his coffee.</t1356> <t1357>Every evening, they would go together to the Moscotes' house.</t1357> <t1358>Aureliano would engage in endless domino games with his father-in-law, while Remedios would chat with her sisters or consult her mother on more important matters.</t1358>
<t1359>Becoming related to the Buendia family had solidified Don Apolinar Moscote's respectability in the village.</t1359> <t1360>By frequently traveling to the capital, he managed to get the government to take action and succeeded in having a school built, which would be headed by Arcadio, who had inherited his grandfather's passion for teaching.</t1360> <t1361>With sweet talk, he persuaded the villagers to paint most of the houses blue for the national independence day.</t1361> <t1362>Under the pressure of Father Nicanor, he had Catarino's shop moved to a back street and closed down the dens of iniquity that had opened in the heart of the village.</t1362> <t1363>On his trips to the capital, he brought armed mounted police to ensure security; no one even remembered the initial agreement not to allow armed men into the village.</t1363> <t1364>Aureliano was pleased with his father-in-law's dominance.</t1364> <t1365>His friends teased him, saying, "You'll get as fat as he is."</t1365> <t1366>However, the monotonous life that made his cheekbones more prominent and intensified the sparkle in his eyes did not make him gain weight; instead, it deepened the thoughtful line at the corner of his lips and the expression of determination.</t1366>
<t1367>They had endeared themselves so much to both the boy's and the girl's side that when Remedios announced she was going to have a child, even Rebeca and Amaranta set aside their quarrels and grievances and took up knitting, blue if it was a boy and pink if it was a girl.</t1367>
<t1368>A few years later, while standing before the firing squad, the last person to cross Arcadio's mind was Remedios.</t1368> <t1369>Ursula declared mourning by locking the windows and doors, and she did not allow anyone to enter or leave the house unless it was very important.</t1369> <t1370>She banned speaking loudly for a year and placed a photograph of Remedios, tied with a black ribbon, and an oil lamp that was never extinguished at the head of her bed.</t1370> <t1371>The later generations who kept the lamp burning without ever extinguishing it would look long and hard at the picture of this girl in a pleated skirt, white boots, and an organza ribbon in her hair, unable to reconcile it with the image of a typical great-great-grandmother.</t1371> <t1372>Amaranta took on the care of Aureliano Jose.</t1372> <t1373>She embraced him like a son who would share her loneliness and save her from the torment of having caused Remedios' death with her frantic prayers.</t1373> <t1374>In the afternoons, Pietro Crespi would come, tiptoeing in his black ribboned hat, to check on Rebeca, whose heart was bleeding in her long-sleeved black dress.</t1374>
<t1375>Even thinking about setting a new date for the wedding seemed like such a great disrespect that their engagement turned into an endless relationship.</t1375> <t1376>The days when they played various games to turn off the lamps just to kiss were long gone; their love had now been abandoned to death, a breathless romance that no one cared about anymore.</t1376> <t1377>Having lost all her hope and all her supports, Rebeca started eating soil again.</t1377>
<t1378>One completely unexpected day -the mourning had lasted so long that the lacework sessions had started again- at noon, when the heat descended with a deadly fervor, someone slammed the street door wide open, and the house shook to its very foundations.</t1378> <t1379>Amaranta, who was embroidering with her friends on the terrace, Rebeca, who was sucking her finger in the bedroom, Ursula in the kitchen, Aureliano in his workshop, and even Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree, all thought there was an earthquake and the house was collapsing on top of them.</t1379> <t1380>A burly man had arrived.</t1380>
<t1381>His broad shoulders couldn't fit through the doors.</t1381><t1382>On his thick neck, reminiscent of wild bulls, hung a Madonna medallion for good luck.</t1382><t1383>His arms and chest were covered with indistinguishable tattoos.</t1383><t1384>On his right wrist, there was a copper bracelet with a ninos-en-cruz amulet hanging from it.</t1384><t1385>His skin was tanned from being outdoors.</t1385><t1386>His hair was very short and smooth like a mule's mane.</t1386><t1387>He had a strong and large chin.</t1387><t1388>He was smiling sadly.</t1388><t1389>The belt around his waist was twice as thick as a horse's girth.</t1389><t1390>He wore boots with knee pads and iron-tipped spurs.</t1390><t1391>He made the ground shake with his steps, as if the earth trembled when he walked.</t1391><t1392>He swung his worn-out saddlebags as he walked across the living room and the sitting room.</t1392><t1393>He burst into the begonia terrace where Amaranta and her friends froze with needles in hand, as if struck by lightning.</t1393><t1394>In a tired voice, he said hello to the girls, placed the saddlebags on the table, and walked towards the back of the house.</t1394><t1395>He also said hello to Rebeca, who was surprised to see him passing by her bedroom.</t1395><t1396>He waved a hello to Aurelio, who was sitting on pins and needles in the silver workshop.</t1396><t1397>He didn't linger with anyone.</t1397><t1398>He went straight to the kitchen and, for the first time since the beginning of his journey from the other end of the world, took a break.</t1398><t1399>Hello, he said.</t1399><t1400>Ursula stood there for a moment with her mouth open, looked into his eyes, screamed, and then hugged him around the neck, crying with joy.</t1400><t1401>It was Jose Arcadio.</t1401><t1402>He had returned penniless, just as he had left.</t1402><t1403>Ursula even had to pay for the horse he had rented.</t1403><t1404>He spoke Spanish mixed with sailor's slang.</t1404><t1405>When they asked him where he had been, he replied, "Way over there."</t1405><t1406>He set up his hammock in the room given to him and slept for three days and three nights.</t1406>
<t1407>When he woke up, after swallowing sixteen raw eggs one after another, he headed straight to Catarino's shop.</t1407> <t1408>The women who saw his gigantic figure were instantly filled with curiosity.</t1408> <t1409>Jose Arcadio ordered music to be played and treated everyone to cane liquor.</t1409> <t1410>He was also saying that he would wrestle with five people at once.</t1410> <t1411>The people there, realizing that they couldn't even bend his arm, let alone bring him down, dismissed it saying, "No way."</t1411> <t1412>He was wearing a Ninos-en-cruz amulet.</t1412> <t1413>Catarino, who didn't believe in gaining strength through amulets or magic, bet twelve pesos that he couldn't move the counter.</t1413> <t1414>Jose Arcadio lifted the counter, carried it over his head, and placed it in the middle of the street.</t1414> <t1415>It took eleven people, sweating profusely, to put the counter back in its place.</t1415> <t1416>Just as the fun was reaching its peak, Jose Arcadio revealed and displayed his unprecedented mark, covered in red and blue tattoos in various languages.</t1416>
<t1417>He told the women clinging to him that he would stay with whoever gave him the most money.</t1417> <t1418>The wealthiest among them gave twenty pesos.</t1418> <t1419>Upon this, Jose Arcadio suggested that the women each give ten pesos and draw lots for him.</t1419> <t1420>This was an unprecedented fee, because even the most successful woman would earn at most eight pesos a night.</t1420> <t1421>Nevertheless, they accepted the proposal.</t1421> <t1422>They wrote their names on fourteen pieces of paper and put them into a hat.</t1422> <t1423>Each woman drew a lot.</t1423> <t1424>When only two pieces of paper remained, it was already clear to whom they belonged.</t1424>
<t1425>Jose Arcadio, "Both of you cough up another five each, and I'll stay with both of you," he said.</t1425>
<t1426>He was earning his bread in this way.</t1426> <t1427>He had mingled with homeless sailors and had circled the globe exactly sixty-five times.</t1427> <t1428>That night, the women he slept with at Catarino's shop stripped him naked in the middle of the night and took him down to the dance hall, showing that from his neck to his toes, both front and back, he was covered in tattoos with no space left for even a pin to prick.</t1428> <t1429>Jose Arcadio could not mix with the family.</t1429> <t1430>He would sleep soundly all day and go to the red-light district at night, betting on his strength.</t1430> <t1431>On the days when Ursula could coax him to sit at the table, he would cheerfully recount his adventures in distant lands.</t1431> <t1432>Once, their ship had wrecked, and they had stayed on a raft in the Sea of Japan for two weeks, surviving by eating their friends who had died from sunstroke and whose flesh, cooked by the sun, tasted somewhat bitter and somewhat sweet.</t1432>
<t1433>On a hot afternoon in the Bay of Bengal, their boat struck and killed a sea dragon, and when they cut open the dragon's belly, they found a crusader's helmet, metal buckles, and weapons.</t1433> <t1434>In the Caribbean Sea, he had seen Victor Hugues' ghost ship, whose sails had been torn by death, whose masts had been gnawed by worms, still trying to find its way to Guadeloupe.</t1434> <t1435>As Jose Arcadio recounted these tales, Ursula would cry as if reading letters from her son in exile that had never arrived, saying, "Here you had a place above our heads, my son."</t1435> <t1436>She would lament, "I always gave the meals I set aside for you to the pigs!"</t1436> <t1437>Yet she could not wholeheartedly believe that this giant of a man, who could devour half a pig in one sitting and still seem unfazed, was the same person as the young man kidnapped by the gypsies.</t1437> <t1438>The other family members shared more or less the same feelings.</t1438> <t1439>Amaranta did not hide her disgust at his animal-like belching at the table.</t1439> <t1440>Arcadio, who knew nothing of the true nature of their bond, would dismissively answer his questions, which were meant to win his affection.</t1440>
<t1441>Aureliano was trying to relive the days when they slept in the same room, to recall childhood memories.</t1441><t1442>However, Jose Arcadio, whose mind was filled with a multitude of memories from his days at sea, had long forgotten his childhood.</t1442><t1443>The only one who couldn't shake off the impact of seeing him for the first time was Rebeca.</t1443><t1444>The day Rebeca saw him passing by the bedroom, she thought that next to this symbol of masculinity, whose presence was felt in every corner of the house like a volcano about to erupt, Pietro Crespi seemed like a delicate dandy.</t1444><t1445>She tried to get close to Jose Arcadio at every opportunity.</t1445><t1446>Once, Jose Arcadio looked her up and down with a brazen gaze and said, "You've become quite a woman, sister."</t1446><t1447>Rebeca couldn't control herself anymore.</t1447><t1448>With the fervor of old days, she started eating dirt again, tearing off and swallowing the plaster from the walls.</t1448><t1449>She sucked her finger so persistently that it eventually became calloused.</t1449><t1450>She was bringing up a green bile in which leech larvae swam.</t1450><t1451>Burning with fever throughout the nights, she tried to stay conscious while waiting for Jose Arcadio's return, which shook the house at dawn.</t1451><t1452>One afternoon, when everyone was taking a siesta, she couldn't stand it any longer and went to Jose Arcadio's room.</t1452><t1453>She found him lying in his hammock, which was tied to the ceiling beams with ship moorings, wearing only his underwear.</t1453><t1454>Rebeca, affected by Jose Arcadio's impressive nakedness, suddenly wanted to flee.</t1454><t1455>I'm sorry.</t1455><t1456>I didn't know you were here, she said, lowering her voice so no one would wake up.</t1456><t1457>Jose Arcadio said, Come here.</t1457><t1458>Rebeca went and stood by the hammock.</t1458><t1459>As Jose Arcadio murmured, My little one, my little one, while caressing her ankles, then her legs, then her calves with his fingertips, cold sweat poured down Rebeca's body, and a knot of pain twisted in her intestines.</t1459><t1460>When an unimaginable force grabbed her by the waist and tore her clothes to shreds in three swift moves, seating her on him like a fledgling bird, Rebeca exerted supernatural strength not to die.</t1460><t1461>Before she lost herself in the unbearable pleasure of that excruciating pain and sank into the mist of the hammock that absorbed the gushing blood like a sponge, she thanked God for being born.</t1461>
<t1462>They got married three days later during the afternoon service.</t1462> <t1463>Jose Arcadio went to Pietro Crespi's shop the day before.</t1463> <t1464>Crespi was teaching music to his students.</t1464> <t1465>Without feeling the need to pull him aside and whisper, Jose Arcadio openly said, I'm marrying Rebeca.</t1465> <t1466>Pietro Crespi's face turned ashen.</t1466> <t1467>He handed the instrument to one of the students and stopped the lesson.</t1467> <t1468>When they were alone in the room filled with musical instruments and mechanical toys, Pietro Crespi said, She's your sister.</t1468>
<t1469>Jose Arcadio replied, "So what?"</t1469>
<t1470>Pietro Crespi wiped his forehead with a handkerchief soaked in coca.</t1470>
<t1471>"It would be against nature," he tried to explain.</t1471> <t1472>"It is also against the laws."</t1472>
<t1473>Although Jose Arcadio did not mind the prolongation of the argument, Pietro Crespi's temper flared as he looked at the ash-colored face.</t1473>
<t1474>"I'll even read nature itself," he said.</t1474> <t1475>"I came to tell you not to ask Rebeca anything, no matter how tempted you are."</t1475>
<t1476>When she saw that Pietro Crespi's eyes were filling with tears, she stopped scolding him.</t1476> <t1477>In a different voice;</t1477>
<t1478>-If you truly love family, there's the lovely Amaranta for you, he said.</t1478>
<t1479>Peder Nicanor announced during the Sunday mass that Jose Arcadio and Rebeca were not siblings.</t1479> <t1480>Ursula never forgave this event, which she deemed an incredible disrespect, and banned the newlyweds from ever setting foot in the house again.</t1480> <t1481>She considered them as good as dead.</t1481> <t1482>They rented a house across from the cemetery and settled in by setting up Jose Arcadio's hammock, their only piece of furniture.</t1482> <t1483>On their wedding night, a scorpion that had crawled into her slipper stung Rebeca's foot.</t1483> <t1484>The girl's tongue went numb.</t1484> <t1485>Nevertheless, this incident did not prevent them from having a honeymoon that caused quite a stir.</t1485> <t1486>The neighbors were astonished by the screams that woke the neighborhood eight times a night and three times during the siesta, and they began to pray that this wildness would not disturb the peace of the dead.</t1486> <t1487>Aureliano was the only one who thought about and cared for them.</t1487> <t1488>He brought them a few pieces of furniture and gave them money until Jose Arcadio came to his senses and started working the abandoned land adjacent to the garden.</t1488> <t1489>On the other hand, although life's twist had brought her an unexpected joy, Amaranta's hatred for Rebeca never faded.</t1489>
<t1490>At Ursula's request, who didn't know how to make people forget the disgrace, Pietro Crespi continued to come for dinner on Tuesdays.</t1490> <t1491>Crespi, who bore his great ruin with dignified composure, still wore a black mourning band on his hat as a sign of respect for the family and demonstrated his affection for Ursula with various gifts.</t1491> <t1492>He brought sardines from Portugal and rose jams made by the Turks.</t1492>
<t1493>Once, he had brought a very beautiful Manila shawl.</t1493> <t1494>Amaranta served him kindly, mending the frayed cuffs of his shirt.</t1494> <t1495>As a birthday gift, she embroidered a dozen handkerchiefs with his initials in the corner.</t1495> <t1496>On Tuesdays, after lunch, while Amaranta sat on the terrace doing embroidery, Pietro Crespi, who kept her company, began to see this woman, whom he had always regarded as a child, as a gift from God.</t1496> <t1497>Amaranta was wild and carefree, but there was nothing she didn't understand.</t1497> <t1498>When she was treated well, she would become gentle and affectionate.</t1498> <t1499>Everyone believed that they would eventually get married.</t1499> <t1500>Indeed, one Tuesday, Pietro Crespi proposed marriage to Amaranta.</t1500> <t1501>Amaranta did not put down her work.</t1501> <t1502>After waiting for the heat pressing against her ears to pass, she gave her voice a mature tone and said:</t1502>
<t1503>"Of course, Crespi," he said.</t1503> <t1504>"But let's leave this matter for a time when we know each other better.</t1504> <t1505>It's never good to rush anything."</t1505>
<t1506>Ursula was bewildered.</t1506> <t1507>She respected Pietro Crespi, but she couldn't determine whether his decision to marry Amaranta after his legendary engagement to Rebeca was morally consistent.</t1507> <t1508>However, when she saw that no one else seemed to care, she decided to stop dwelling on it.</t1508> <t1509>Aureliano, the man of the house, further confused his mother with his incomprehensible words:</t1509>
<t1510>"Now is not the time to worry about marriages," he was saying.</t1510>
<t1511>These words, which Ursula could only understand a month later, were the only ones Aureliano could sincerely utter at that moment.</t1511> <t1512>What he said encompassed not only the topic of marriage but everything unrelated to the war.</t1512> <t1513>Even he couldn't fully comprehend the series of insignificant but irreversible events that led him to that point when he stood before the firing squad.</t1513> <t1514>Remedios's death had not caused the devastation in Aureliano that he had feared.</t1514> <t1515>He felt a silent rage that gradually turned into an inward resentment during the period he lived without a woman.</t1515> <t1516>He had returned to his work but had not given up his habit of playing dominoes with his father-in-law.</t1516> <t1517>The conversations held in the mourning house from evening to evening brought the two men closer together and strengthened their friendship.</t1517> <t1518>His father-in-law would say, "Remarry, Aurelito."</t1518> <t1519>"Look, I have six more daughters."</t1519> <t1520>"Choose the one you like and take her."</t1520>
<t1521>The night of the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote, who had just returned from one of his frequent trips, was quite pessimistic about the political situation in the country.</t1521> <t1522>The Liberals were determined to fight.</t1522> <t1523>At that time, since Aureliano did not have sufficient knowledge about the distinction between Conservatives and Liberals, his father-in-law briefly explained to him what was what.</t1523> <t1524>According to Moscote, the Liberals were Freemasons, bad people, who would hang and strangle priests, disregard religious rules, come up with new inventions like civil marriage and divorce, grant the same rights to illegitimate children as to other children, and weaken the power of the state by dividing the country with a federal system.</t1524>
<t1525>However, the Conservatives, who derived their power directly from God, wanted to defend the established order, ensure public order, and protect the sanctity and morality of the family institution.</t1525> <t1526>They were the guardians of our Lord Jesus' religion, the defenders of the principle of sovereignty, and they would not allow the country to be divided into autonomous administrative regions; they would ensure the integrity of the homeland.</t1526> <t1527>Aureliano, influenced by his humane feelings, sided with the Liberals because of their stance on illegitimate children.</t1527> <t1528>But he could never understand how discussions about intangible matters could bring the parties to the brink of war.</t1528> <t1529>He also attributed the arrival of six armed soldiers, led by a sergeant, to a village where no one had any political passion, during election time, to his father-in-law's meddling.</t1529>
<t1530>When the soldiers arrived in the village, they did not remain idle.</t1530> <t1531>They went from house to house and collected all the weapons they could find.</t1531> <t1532>They even took bread knives along with cane knives.</t1532> <t1533>Then they distributed blue ballots with the names of Conservative candidates and red ballots for the Liberals to men over twenty-one years old.</t1533> <t1534>On the evening before the elections, Don Apolinar Moscote read a proclamation banning the sale of alcoholic beverages and the gathering of more than three people from different families.</t1534> <t1535>The elections passed without incident.</t1535> <t1536>At eight on Sunday morning, a ballot box was placed in the square.</t1536> <t1537>Six soldiers stood guard at the ballot box.</t1537>
<t1538>The election was conducted in an atmosphere of great freedom and maturity.</t1538>
<t1539>Aureliano, since he was with his father-in-law who did not leave the ballot box to ensure no one voted more than once, witnessed these free and mature elections with his own eyes.</t1539> <t1540>At four in the afternoon, the end of voting was announced with a drum played in the square.</t1540> <t1541>Don Apolinar Moscote sealed the ballot box, labeled it, and signed the label.</t1541> <t1542>That night, while playing dominoes with Aureliano, Moscote told the sergeant to break the seal of the ballot box and count the votes.</t1542> <t1543>From the box came an equal number of blue and red ballots, but the sergeant left only ten red ballots in the box and filled the difference with blue ones.</t1543> <t1544>Then they sealed the box again and sent it to the capital without delay the next morning.</t1544> <t1545>The Liberals will declare war, said Aureliano.</t1545>
<t1546>Don Apolinar was completely focused on the domino tiles.</t1546> <t1547>If you're saying this because we changed the votes, don't worry, they won't start a war, he said.</t1547> <t1548>We left a few red ballots so that no one would have anything to say.</t1548> <t1549>Aureliano was slowly understanding the disadvantages of being in opposition.</t1549> <t1550>If I were a liberal, I would go to war over these votes; he said.</t1550>
<t1551>His father-in-law scrutinized him over his glasses.</t1551>
<t1552>"What else, Aurelito," she said.</t1552> <t1553>"If you were a Liberal, you wouldn't even know that the ballots were changed, even though you're my son-in-law."</t1553>
<t1554>It wasn't the election results that stirred up the village, but the soldiers' refusal to return the weapons they had collected from the houses.</t1554> <t1555>A group of women gathered and went to Aureliano, asking him to request the bread knives from his father-in-law.</t1555> <t1556>Don Apolinar Moscote, as if revealing a state secret to his son-in-law, said that the soldiers had taken the knives to the capital as evidence of the Liberals' war preparations.</t1556> <t1557>This deceitful, treacherous attitude horrified Aureliano.</t1557> <t1558>He said nothing to his father-in-law.</t1558> <t1559>One evening, while Gerineldo Marquez and Magnifico Visbal were sitting with their friends discussing the matter of the knives, they turned to Aureliano and asked if he was a Liberal or a Conservative. He did not hesitate.</t1559>
<t1560>If I absolutely had to take a side, I would be a Liberal, he said.</t1560> <t1561>Conservatives are deceitful, scheming.</t1561>
<t1562>The next day, upon the insistence of his friends, he went to Dr. Alirio Noguera, supposedly to cure the pain in his liver.</t1562> <t1563>He couldn't understand why he needed to lie about being sick.</t1563> <t1564>Dr. Alirio Noguera had come to Macondo a few years earlier with a box of unpleasant pills and a saying that no one could make sense of: "A nail drives out another nail," he said.</t1564> <t1565>In fact, he was a charlatan.</t1565> <t1566>Behind the guise of a doctor with no respectability, a terrorist was hidden.</t1566> <t1567>The short boots he always wore covered the marks left on his legs by five years of shackles.</t1567> <t1568>He had been arrested during the first actions of the Federalists, had to disguise himself in the form he most opposed in the world, and managed to escape to Curaçao by wearing a priest's robe.</t1568> <t1569>After living in exile for many years, he could no longer stay put upon hearing news from fellow exiles spread across the Caribbean coming to Curaçao, and he took a smuggler's boat to Riohacha.</t1569>
<t1570>He had nothing but pills made of powdered sugar and a fake diploma from Leipzig University.</t1570><t1571>He cried in disappointment at what he saw.</t1571><t1572>The federalist force, which the smugglers had endlessly described as a boiling cauldron ready to explode, had dissipated in an obscure election frenzy.</t1572><t1573>The fake doctor, devastated by the defeat and seeking a place to spend the rest of his life in peace, took refuge in Macondo.</t1573><t1574>In a room filled with rented bottles of pills in a corner of the area, he lived off the desperate patients who, after trying every remedy, consoled themselves with sugar pills for a few years.</t1574><t1575>During the years when Don Apolinar Moscote supposedly governed, there was no sign of incitement from the doctor.</t1575><t1576>He spent his time reminiscing about the old days and battling asthma.</t1576><t1577>With the approach of the elections, things got out of hand, and the doctor found himself once again in the role of an agitator.</t1577><t1578>He established relationships with the village youths who were completely unaware of politics and continuously ran an incitement campaign.</t1578>
<t1579>The red votes that came out of the ballot box, which Don Apolinar Moscote interpreted as a youthful whim, were part of the doctor's plan.</t1579> <t1580>He had made the young people vote to prove that the elections were nothing but a sham.</t1580> <t1581>The only thing that has an effect is acts of violence, he would say.</t1581> <t1582>Most of Aureliano's friends intended to overthrow the Conservative government.</t1582> <t1583>However, no one dared to reveal their plans to him.</t1583> <t1584>They couldn't open up to him not only because he was the son-in-law of the justice of the peace, but also because he was a reserved person.</t1584> <t1585>Moreover, it was known that he voted blue just because his father-in-law wanted him to.</t1585>
<t1586>In short, Aureliano's political stance was revealed purely by chance.</t1586> <t1587>Although he was perfectly healthy, he went to the doctor out of sheer curiosity.</t1587> <t1588>When Aureliano entered the room that smelled of camphor and was covered in cobwebs, he found himself in front of someone who resembled a dusty lizard, wheezing with every breath.</t1588> <t1589>Without asking him anything, the doctor took him to the window and looked inside his lower eyelid.</t1589> <t1590>Aureliano said, "My problem isn't there."</t1590>
<t1591>They had advised him to say it that way.</t1591> <t1592>Pressing the tips of his fingers against his liver, he added, The pain that keeps me awake at night is right here.</t1592> <t1593>Upon this, Dr. Noguera, pretending to be bothered by the sun, closed the curtain and explained to Aureliano in simple terms that he could understand that killing the Conservatives was an act of patriotism.</t1593>
<t1594>Aureliano carried a bottle of medicine in his shirt pocket for several days.</t1594> <t1595>Every two hours, he would take out the bottle, take three pills into his palm, and slowly suck on them.</t1595> <t1596>Don Apolinar Moscote mocked him for believing in old wives' remedies, but those involved in the assassination plot considered him one of their own.</t1596>
<t1597>Although none of them knew exactly what action would be taken, almost all the sons of the village founders had joined the organization.</t1597> <t1598>However, the day the doctor hinted at what was to be done, Aureliano understood the plan.</t1598> <t1599>Although he believed that the Conservative regime needed to be overthrown, he was frightened by what was being planned.</t1599> <t1600>Dr. Noguera was fixated on assassinations.</t1600> <t1601>These actions, which would be triggered at the push of a button, would plan the killing of individuals one by one, ultimately leading to the elimination of those running the regime along with their families, especially their children, thereby eradicating Conservatism throughout the country.</t1601> <t1602>Needless to say, Don Apolinar Moscote, his wife, and his six daughters were also on this list.</t1602>
<t1603>Aureliano, without losing his composure, said to the doctor, "You are not a liberal at all."</t1603> <t1604>"You can be nothing but a butcher."</t1604>
<t1605>The doctor responded with the same calmness.</t1605> <t1606>Then give the bottle back.</t1606> <t1607>You don't need it anymore.</t1607>
<t1608>Aureliano only learned six months later that the doctor had looked at his emotional, introverted, solitary nature and concluded that he could not be a man of action.</t1608> <t1609>His friends did not leave Aureliano's side, fearing he might reveal their plans, so they did not leave him alone.</t1609> <t1610>Aureliano reassured them.</t1610> <t1611>He would not let a single word slip, but on the night they came to kill Moscote and his family, they would find him standing guard at the door.</t1611> <t1612>He was so determined in this matter that the assassination plan was postponed to an indefinite date.</t1612> <t1613>It was precisely during those days that Ursula asked what he thought about Pietro Crespi and Amaranta getting married, and Aureliano said it was not the time to worry about their marriage.</t1613> <t1614>For a week, he had been carrying an old model pistol under his shirt; he did not take his eyes off his friends.</t1614> <t1615>In the evenings, he would go to visit Jose Arcadio and Rebeca, who had started tidying up their house, and after seven o'clock, he would play dominoes with his father-in-law.</t1615> <t1616>At lunch, he would chat with Arcadio, who was now a grown young man, and he saw that Arcadio was very excited about the outbreak of war.</t1616> <t1617>In the school where Arcadio taught, there were students older than him.</t1617> <t1618>Those who had just learned to speak and those with hair and beard intertwined were together.</t1618> <t1619>The fire of liberalism had also engulfed the school.</t1619> <t1620>There was talk of Father Nicanor being shot, the church being turned into a school, and free love being recognized.</t1620>
<t1621>Aureliano tried to calm Arcadio's outbursts.</t1621> <t1622>He advised him to be sensible and moderate.</t1622> <t1623>However, Arcadio ignored his rational views and realism, and accused him of being unprincipled in front of everyone.</t1623> <t1624>Aureliano waited.</t1624> <t1625>Finally, one day in early December, Ursula, trembling all over, burst into the workshop.</t1625>
<t1626>-The war has broken out!</t1626>
<t1627>In fact, it had been three months since the war broke out.</t1627> <t1628>Martial law had been declared throughout the country.</t1628> <t1629>The only one who received news of the events immediately was Don Apolinar Moscote.</t1629> <t1630>But even though the army unit that occupied the village had set out, he hadn't even told his wife about it.</t1630> <t1631>The soldiers entered the village before dawn with two light cannons pulled by mules and set up headquarters in the school.</t1631> <t1632>A curfew was imposed after six in the evening.</t1632> <t1633>A much more meticulous investigation was conducted than the previous one, all the houses were searched thoroughly, and even agricultural tools were confiscated.</t1633> <t1634>They dragged Dr. Noguera to the square, tied him to a tree, and shot him without any questioning.</t1634> <t1635>Father Nicanor tried to impress the military authorities with the miracle of flying, but one of the soldiers brought down the butt of his rifle, splitting his head in two.</t1635> <t1636>The enthusiasm of the Liberals turned into this silent horror.</t1636> <t1637>The sallow-faced, silent Aureliano continued his domino games with his father-in-law.</t1637>
<t1638>Although he held the title of the so-called civilian and military leader of the village, Don Apolinar Moscote had once again lost his respect.</t1638> <t1639>The decisions were made by the captain, and extraordinary meetings were held every morning to maintain order.</t1639> <t1640>One day, four of the soldiers under his command forcibly took a woman who had been bitten by a rabid dog from her family and beat her to death with their rifle butts.</t1640> <t1641>Two weeks after the occupation, on a Sunday, Aureliano went to Gerineldo Marquez's house and, in his usual taciturn manner, asked for a cup of plain coffee.</t1641> <t1642>When the two were alone in the kitchen, Aureliano spoke in a tone of authority that had been unfamiliar until that day.</t1642> <t1643>Prepare the boys, he said.</t1643> <t1644>We are going to war.</t1644>
<t1645>Gerineldo Marquez couldn't believe his ears.</t1645>
<t1646>"With which weapons?" he asked.</t1646>
<t1647>Aureliano replied, With their weapons.</t1647>
<t1648>In a reckless move made at midnight on Tuesday, twenty-one men under the command of Aureliano Buendia, none of whom were over thirty years old, armed with kitchen knives and sharpened tools, stormed the garrison, seized the weapons, and executed the captain and the four soldiers who had killed the woman in the garden.</t1648>
<t1649>That night, before the sound of the firing squad's bullets had even died down, Arcadio was declared the military and civil leader of the village.</t1649> <t1650>Those among the insurgents who were married only had enough time to bid farewell to their wives.</t1650> <t1651>Leaving them behind, they set out at dawn amidst the enthusiastic demonstrations of the people liberated from terror.</t1651> <t1652>According to the latest news, they were heading to join the forces of the revolutionary General Victoria Medina, who had set out towards Manaure.</t1652> <t1653>Before leaving, Aureliano brought Don Apolinar Moscote out from the closet where he had been hiding.</t1653> <t1654>Don't be afraid, father, he said.</t1654> <t1655>The new government promises to protect your and your family's personal safety.</t1655> <t1656>Don Apolinar Moscote couldn't determine whether this rebel, wearing long boots and carrying a rifle over his shoulder, was the same person he used to play dominoes with in the evenings.</t1656>
<t1657>This is madness, Aurelito, he shouted.</t1657>
<t1658>Aureliano said, It's not madness, it's war.</t1658> <t1659>And don't call me Aurelito anymore.</t1659> <t1660>I'm now Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t1660>
<t1661>Colonel Aureliano Buendia organized thirty-two armed uprisings, and he was defeated in all of them.</t1661> <t1662>He had seventeen sons by seventeen different women, and before the oldest reached thirty-five, all seventeen were killed in one night.</t1662> <t1663>He survived fourteen assassination attempts, seventy-three ambushes, and a firing squad.</t1663>
<t1664>He drank strychnine-laced coffee strong enough to knock out a big horse and still managed to save his skin.</t1664><t1665>He refused the medal of merit given by the President.</t1665><t1666>He rose to the command of the revolutionary forces, his fame spread from one border to the other throughout the country, he became the person the government feared the most, and he never allowed his picture to be taken.</t1666><t1667>After the war, he refused the lifelong pension that was offered to him and even in his old age, he earned his living by making silver fish in his workshop in Macondo.</t1667><t1668>Despite leading his men into battle in every skirmish, the only wound he received was by his own hand.</t1668>
<t1669>After signing the Neerlandia Treaty, which ended the twenty-year-long civil war, he shot himself in the chest, but the bullet missed all vital organs and exited through his back as smoothly as pulling a hair from butter.</t1669> <t1670>The only thing that remained from all this was a street in Macondo that bore his name.</t1670> <t1671>However, a few years before he died of old age, as he himself said, at dawn when he set out with twenty-one companions to join General Victorio Medina's forces, he did not expect any of this.</t1671>
<t1672>All he said to Arcadio before leaving was, "We are leaving Macondo to you."</t1672> <t1673>"We are leaving it in good condition; let us find it in better condition when we return."</t1673>
<t1674>Arcadio interpreted these words as it suited him.</t1674> <t1675>He fashioned a uniform for himself.</t1675> <t1676>He rummaged through Melquiades' books from cover to cover and acquired a jacket with braids and epaulettes, like a marshal's uniform.</t1676> <t1677>He secured the sword at his waist with gold-embroidered buckles he had stripped from the captain who was executed by firing squad.</t1677> <t1678>He positioned the cannons at the entrance of the village, outfitted his former students who had risen up with uniforms, and sent them out into the streets with fiery speeches.</t1678> <t1679>In this way, he wanted to create the impression among outsiders that the village was defended by invincible forces.</t1679> <t1680>This was a double-edged deception.</t1680> <t1681>Because the government did not dare to attack the village for ten months; and when they finally did, they attacked with such overwhelming force that the village's resistance crumbled within half an hour.</t1681>
<t1682>Arcadio revealed his keen interest in proclamations from the very first day of his administration.</t1682> <t1683>He would announce everything that came to his mind through a proclamation, sometimes issuing four decrees in a single day.</t1683> <t1684>He mandated compulsory military service for those over eighteen, declared that animals wandering aimlessly after six in the evening would be considered public property, and required the elderly to wear a red armband.</t1684>
<t1685>He had cornered Peder Nicanor, threatened him with torture, and forbidden him from holding services and ringing the bell unless it was for the victory of the Liberals.</t1685> <t1686>To ensure that no one doubted the decisiveness of his orders, he lined up a firing squad in the village square and had a scarecrow shot.</t1686> <t1687>At first, no one took him seriously.</t1687> <t1688>After all, they were all just children pretending to be important.</t1688>
<t1689>But one night, Arcadio went to Catarino's shop.</t1689> <t1690>When the drummer saw him, he greeted him with a tremolo.</t1690> <t1691>The people there started to laugh.</t1691> <t1692>Arcadio, losing his temper, had the drummer shot for disrespecting the authorities.</t1692> <t1693>He also imprisoned those who opposed this by locking their ankles between two logs and giving them nothing but bread and water.</t1693> <t1694>When Ursula learned of his arbitrary actions, she would shout in his face, Murderer!</t1694> <t1695>When Aureliano hears about what you've done, he'll have you shot, and I'll be the first to cheer.</t1695>
<t1696>But what was the use of her wishes?</t1696> <t1697>Arcadio increased the pressure more and more, squeezing the people tighter and tighter.</t1697> <t1698>In the end, he became the most ruthless ruler Macondo had ever seen.</t1698> <t1699>One day, Don Apolinar Moscote made a mistake, saying they should beat their heads against the wall to understand the difference.</t1699> <t1700>This is what they call the Liberal paradise, he said.</t1700> <t1701>These words reached Arcadio's ears.</t1701> <t1702>He led the patrols to raid Moscote's house, smashed his belongings, and had his daughters whipped.</t1702> <t1703>He dragged Don Apolinar Moscote outside.</t1703>
<t1704>When Ursula heard what had happened, she went mad with rage.</t1704> <t1705>Grabbing the whip, she ran to the headquarters, shouting and cursing.</t1705> <t1706>As Ursula burst into the courtyard, Arcadio was about to give the order to fire.</t1706>
<t1707>"Hit me if you dare, you son of a bitch!" he shouted.</t1707>
<t1708>Without giving Arcadio a chance to open his mouth, she shouted, "Alright, you murderer!" and brought down the whip.</t1708> <t1709>"Kill me too, son of a devilish mother."</t1709> <t1710>"Kill me so I don't have to shed tears for raising a monster."</t1710> <t1711>Ursula was bringing down the whip mercilessly.</t1711> <t1712>Whipping and whipping, she chased Arcadio to the back yard.</t1712> <t1713>Arcadio shrank into a corner like a snail retreating into its shell.</t1713> <t1714>Don Apolinar Moscote, who was tied to the place where the scarecrow they had previously shot and shattered for fun stood, had passed out.</t1714> <t1715>The children in the firing squad scattered like chicks out of fear that Ursula might beat them too.</t1715> <t1716>However, Ursula didn't even look at them.</t1716> <t1717>She left Arcadio, whose collar and cuffs were torn, screaming in pain and anger; she went and untied Don Apolinar Moscote and took him home.</t1717> <t1718>Before leaving the headquarters, she also freed the prisoners who were tied to the log.</t1718>
<t1719>From that day on, Ursula was the one who governed the village.</t1719> <t1720>She reinstated the Sunday masses, opposed the wearing of red armbands, and repealed the absurd decrees.</t1720> <t1721>Despite all her strength, she couldn't help but cry over the misfortunes that befell her.</t1721>
<t1722>She felt such great loneliness that she even sought solace in chatting with her husband forgotten under the chestnut tree.</t1722> <t1723>On days when the June rains poured as if they would destroy the arbor, she would say, Look at what we've come to.</t1723> <t1724>Look at this house, it's deserted.</t1724> <t1725>Our children have scattered in all directions.</t1725> <t1726>It's just you and me left alone.</t1726>
<t1727>Just like in the beginning.</t1727> <t1728>Jose Arcadio Buendia, who had already fallen into the abyss of unconsciousness, couldn't even hear what his wife was saying.</t1728> <t1729>In the early days of his madness, he would express his daily needs in Latin words.</t1729>
<t1730>When the clouds enveloping his mind parted, even if only for short periods, he spoke sensibly, and when Amaranta brought his meal, he would tell her what was bothering him and did not object to her applying a mustard plaster or using a cupping glass on his back.</t1730>
<t1731>When Ama Ursula started to lament to him, Jose Arcadio Buendia had already severed all ties with reality.</t1731><t1732>Ursula would slowly clean him without moving him from his place, while also informing him about what was happening within the family.</t1732><t1733>As she scrubbed her husband's back with soap, she would say, "It's been four months since Aureliano went to war, and we haven't heard a word from him."</t1733><t1734>"Jose Arcadio has grown into a big man and returned."</t1734><t1735>"Even you would look small next to him."</t1735><t1736>"He has tattoos all over his body."</t1736><t1737>"Unfortunately, he does nothing but bring us disgrace."</t1737><t1738>Upon hearing the bad news, Ursula felt as if her husband was saddened.</t1738><t1739>So she decided to lie to him.</t1739><t1740>While sprinkling ash over her husband's filth before scooping it up with a shovel, she said, "Look, I'll tell you something you won't believe."</t1740><t1741>"God wanted Jose Arcadio and Rebeca to get married, and now there's no end to their happiness."</t1741>
<t1742>He narrated these deceptions so sincerely that in the end, he began to console himself with his own lies.</t1742> <t1743>Arcadio has become a dignified man now, he would say.</t1743> <t1744>Brave, oh so brave.</t1744> <t1745>Handsome, oh so handsome.</t1745> <t1746>You should see him when he puts on his uniform and straps on his sword.</t1746> <t1747>Yet, talking to him was no different than talking to a dead man, indistinguishable.</t1747> <t1748>Because Jose Arcadio Buendia seemed so harmless, so withdrawn from the world, that Ursula decided to unravel him.</t1748> <t1749>After being unraveled, Jose Arcadio Buendia did not move from his place.</t1749> <t1750>As if bound to the trunk of the chestnut tree by invisible bonds stronger than any rope, he sat there, come rain or shine.</t1750> <t1751>Towards August, when it seemed like winter would never end, Ursula was able to give him news that resembled reality:</t1751>
<t1752>"Do you still believe our luck is holding?" he began.</t1752> <t1753>Amaranta and the Italian lantern maker are getting married.</t1753>
<t1754>Indeed, Amaranta and Pietro Crespi had advanced their friendship.</t1754> <t1755>Ursula, who no longer saw it necessary to watch over them, also supported this friendship.</t1755> <t1756>Everyone considered them as engaged.</t1756> <t1757>The Italian, arriving at dusk with a daffodil pinned to his jacket collar, would translate Petrarch's poems for Amaranta.</t1757> <t1758>They would sit on the terrace, breathless from the scent of hydrangeas and roses, -without caring whether there was a war or bad news- one reading poetry, the other sewing lace cuffs, until the mosquitoes made the terrace uninhabitable and drove them inside.</t1758> <t1759>Amaranta's sensible and modest demeanor, her measured but sincere closeness, had woven an invisible net around her fiancé.</t1759> <t1760>When Pietro Crespi reluctantly left the house at eight in the evening, it was as if he was pushing aside this net with his ringless fingers to make his way.</t1760>
<t1761>They had placed the postcards sent to Pietro Crespi from Italy into an album.</t1761> <t1762>The cards had pictures of lovers holding hands in deserted parks.</t1762> <t1763>In the corners, there were hearts pierced by arrows and golden ribbons in the beaks of doves.</t1763> <t1764>While looking at the cards, Pietro Crespi would say, I went to this park when I was in Florence.</t1764> <t1765>In that park, you take some feed in your hand, open your palm, and feed the birds.</t1765>
<t1766>Sometimes, while looking at a watercolor painting of Venice, homesickness would turn the slimy mud of the canals, the acrid smell of sticky jellyfish, into the scent of flowers in the Italian's nose.</t1766> <t1767>Amaranta would sigh, laugh, and dream of a second homeland filled with old cities where handsome men and beautiful women speaking a childlike language lived, and where only cats roamed the garbage dumps of its former glory.</t1767> <t1768>After crossing oceans to find this second homeland and confusing passion with love through Rebeca's fiery embraces, Pietro Crespi had found true love.</t1768> <t1769>Alongside happiness, he had also attained wealth.</t1769>
<t1770>At that time, his shop and warehouse extended from one street to the next.</t1770> <t1771>From a model of the bell tower in Florence, which rang tiny bells every hour, to musical boxes from Sorrento, to cabinets from China that played music when opened, the shop had everything imaginable, from every kind of musical instrument to every conceivable type of mechanical toy.</t1771> <t1772>Since Pietro Crespi could only spare time to give music lessons, the shop was run by his brother, Bruna Crespi.</t1772> <t1773>Thanks to Pietro Crespi, Turkish Street turned into an oasis of melodies that made people forget Arcadio's whimsical behavior and the nightmare of the distant war.</t1773> <t1774>When Ursula resumed the Sunday services, Pietro Crespi donated a small German organ to the church.</t1774> <t1775>He formed a children's choir and prepared a Gregorian repertoire that added grandeur to Father Nicanor's silent mass.</t1775>
<t1776>There was no doubt that Amaranta was his perfect match.</t1776> <t1777>Without forcing their emotions, letting themselves flow naturally, they reached a point where there was nothing left to do but set the wedding date.</t1777> <t1778>There were no obstacles in their way.</t1778> <t1779>Ursula, feeling guilty for having altered Rebeca's fate by continually postponing her marriage, was now careful to avoid creating new sorrows.</t1779> <t1780>The progression of the war, Aureliano's absence, Arcadio's cruelty, and the expulsion of Jose Arcadio and Rebeca from the house had pushed the mourning for Remedios into the background.</t1780> <t1781>In those days leading up to the wedding, Pietro Crespi had begun to accept Aureliano Jose, who was as attached to him as a son, as his first child.</t1781> <t1782>All the events around her seemed to herald a carefree, perfect happiness for Amaranta.</t1782> <t1783>However, unlike Rebeca, Amaranta showed no signs of excitement.</t1783>
<t1784>Just as she patiently dyes the tablecloths, quietly knits the unique lace, and embroiders peacocks from needlework, she was eagerly awaiting the moment when Pietro Crespi could no longer ignore the voice of his heart.</t1784> <t1785>The day she had been waiting for came with the autumn rains at the beginning of October.</t1785> <t1786>Pietro Crespi took the sewing box from her lap and said, "We are getting married next month."</t1786> <t1787>When his ice-cold hands touched hers, Amaranta did not shiver at all.</t1787> <t1788>Like a docile animal, she withdrew her hands and continued her work.</t1788>
<t1789>"Simplification," Crespi said, smiling.</t1789> <t1790>"I wouldn't marry you even if I died."</t1790>
<t1791>Pietro Crespi could no longer hold himself back.</t1791> <t1792>Without any shame, he was sobbing uncontrollably, rubbing his hands in despair as if he would break his fingers.</t1792> <t1793>But he couldn't soften Amaranta.</t1793>
<t1794>-Don't waste your time.</t1794> <t1795>If you really love me, you will never set foot in this house again, she said, and no other words came out of the girl's mouth.</t1795> <t1796>Ursula was dying of shame.</t1796> <t1797>Pietro Crespi did not tire of begging and pleading.</t1797> <t1798>He was willing to endure all kinds of disgrace and humiliation.</t1798> <t1799>He spent an entire day with his head resting on Ursula's lap, crying.</t1799> <t1800>Ursula was ready to give her life if it would console him.</t1800>
<t1801>On rainy nights, Crespi would open his umbrella and circle around the house to see the light in Amaranta's room.</t1801> <t1802>He had never dressed as well as he did in those days.</t1802> <t1803>He held his head, reminiscent of an emperor who had lost his throne and crown, with a peculiar dignity and nobility.</t1803> <t1804>He went to the friends who sat on the terrace with Amaranta, doing embroidery.</t1804> <t1805>He left no stone unturned to persuade Amaranta.</t1805> <t1806>He neglected his work.</t1806> <t1807>He would lock himself in the room at the back of the shop from morning till night, writing passionate letters and sending them to Amaranta with dried flower petals and butterflies.</t1807> <t1808>But Amaranta would send the letters back unopened.</t1808> <t1809>Crespi would retreat to a corner and play the lute for hours.</t1809> <t1810>One night, he even sang.</t1810> <t1811>The divine melodies from the strings of the lute, resembling a qanun, and the soulful voice that could serve as proof that no one in the world could love this much, awakened the entire Macondo.</t1811> <t1812>All the lights in the village were lit one by one, except for Amaranta's.</t1812> <t1813>On the second of November, All Saints' Day, Crespi's brother opened the shop.</t1813>
<t1814>All the lights were on.</t1814> <t1815>All the musical boxes were open.</t1815> <t1816>All the clocks were striking an endless hour.</t1816> <t1817>And amidst this crazy music, they found Pietro Crespi at the back of the shop, having slit his wrists with a razor and dipped his hands in a bowl of basil.</t1817>
<t1818>Ursula announced that the deceased would stay in their house that night, a vigil would be held, and the traditional funeral meal would be eaten.</t1818> <t1819>Father Nicanor opposed holding a religious ceremony and burying the deceased in consecrated ground.</t1819> <t1820>Ursula confronted him.</t1820> <t1821>He was a holy man in a way that neither you nor I can comprehend, she said.</t1821> <t1822>Therefore, whether you like it or not, I will bury him next to Melquiades.</t1822> <t1823>And she did; with the support of the entire village and a grand funeral ceremony.</t1823> <t1824>Amaranta did not leave her bedroom.</t1824>
<t1825>From where she lay, she could hear Ursula crying, the footsteps and whispers of the crowd filling the house, and the lamentations of the mourners.</t1825> <t1826>Then a silence began that smelled of crushed flowers.</t1826> <t1827>For a long time, as evening fell, Amaranta continued to smell the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi.</t1827> <t1828>But she was strong enough not to lose herself.</t1828> <t1829>Ursula had left her to her own devices and had stopped caring.</t1829> <t1830>Even when one afternoon, Amaranta went to the kitchen, plunged her hand into the coals in the stove, and burned her hand until she felt a pain beyond the smell of her burning flesh, Ursula did not turn her head to look.</t1830> <t1831>Remorse could not be alleviated this way.</t1831> <t1832>For a few days, Amaranta walked around the house with her hand wrapped in an egg white poultice.</t1832> <t1833>It was as if the egg white had seared not only the burn on her hand but also the wounds in her heart.</t1833>
<t1834>The only visible trace left from this tragedy was the black cloth wrapped around Amaranta's burned hand, which she never removed until her death.</t1834> <t1835>Arcadio showed an unexpected act of humanity by declaring official mourning for Pietro Crespi.</t1835> <t1836>Ursula interpreted this behavior as the return of the lamb that had strayed from the flock.</t1836> <t1837>However, she was mistaken.</t1837> <t1838>She had lost Arcadio not on the day he donned the uniform, but from the very beginning.</t1838> <t1839>She thought she had raised Arcadio just as she had raised Rebeca, without any difference, treating him no differently than her own children.</t1839> <t1840>However, during the insomnia plague, amidst Ursula's efforts to repair the house, when Jose Arcadio Buendia lost his mind, during Aureliano's days of seclusion, and throughout the deadly feud between Amaranta and Rebeca, Arcadio had always lived a lonely and timid childhood.</t1840> <t1841>Indeed, Aureliano had taught him to read and write.</t1841> <t1842>But he did so as if teaching a stranger, without genuine interest, his mind always elsewhere.</t1842>
<t1843>He also gave his clothes that had become unwearable to Arcadio, and Visitacion would alter and shorten them to fit the child.</t1843> <t1844>Throughout his childhood, Arcadio suffered the discomfort of wearing oversized shoes, patched pants, and feminine hips.</t1844> <t1845>He spoke with Visitacion and Cataure in their language, unable to communicate with anyone else as he did with them.</t1845> <t1846>The only person who truly cared for him was Melquiades, who read him his incomprehensible writings and taught him the art of photography.</t1846>
<t1847>Nobody knew that when Melquiades died, Arcadio secretly shed tears and tried to revive him by futilely examining his writings.</t1847> <t1848>The period when he was a respected and beloved teacher, followed by his time in power with endless decrees and a mottled uniform, freed him from the weight of an old sorrow.</t1848> <t1849>One night in Catarino's shop, someone dared to say, "You are not worthy of the surname you carry."</t1849> <t1850>Contrary to what was expected, Arcadio did not have the man executed by firing squad.</t1850>
<t1851>-Not being a Buendia is the greatest honor for me, he said.</t1851>
<t1852>Those who knew the secret about Arcadio's parents thought, upon hearing these words, that he also knew the truth.</t1852> <t1853>But Arcadio had never learned this truth.</t1853> <t1854>In the dark room, Pilar Ternera, who had once been an irresistible passion first for Jose Arcadio and then for Aureliano, was now the same for Arcadio: Even though her former beauty was gone and her laughter no longer echoed as it used to, Arcadio always sought her out and found her by the scent of smoky mist.</t1854> <t1855>Shortly before the war, when Pilar Ternera came a little later than usual to pick up her young son from school, she found Arcadio waiting for her in the room where he took his afternoon naps and later shackled the prisoners to the log.</t1855> <t1856>The child was playing in the garden, and Arcadio, knowing that Pilar Ternera had to pass through that room, lay in his hammock, trembling as he waited.</t1856> <t1857>The woman arrived.</t1857> <t1858>Arcadio grabbed her by the wrist and tried to pull her into the hammock.</t1858>
<t1859>Pilar Ternera was horrified.</t1859> <t1860>No! No! she was saying.</t1860> <t1861>You can't know how much I want to make you happy, but God knows, I can't do it.</t1861>
<t1862>Arcadio, with the strength inherited from his ancestors, grabbed the woman by the waist, and the moment he touched her skin, the world vanished from his sight.</t1862> <t1863>Don't try to put on an act of decency, he said.</t1863>
<t1864>Who doesn't know about her promiscuity?</t1864> <t1865>Pilar cursed her bad fate inwardly.</t1865>
<t1866>"The children might see," he whispered.</t1866> <t1867>"It's best not to bolt the door tonight."</t1867>
<t1868>That night Arcadio waited for her in his hammock, trembling with fever.</t1868> <t1869>He couldn't sleep, listening intently.</t1869> <t1870>In the endless hours of the approaching dawn, as he heard the sound of crickets and the merciless cries of curlews heralding the new day, he became increasingly convinced that he had been deceived.</t1870> <t1871>Just as his excitement turned to anger, the door suddenly opened.</t1871> <t1872>Months later, as Arcadio stood before the firing squad, he would remember the footsteps in the classroom, the slamming of desks, the weight of a body leaning against his in the darkness of the room, and the breath from another heart mingling with his own.</t1872> <t1873>Arcadio reached out his hand and in the darkness caught another hand with two rings on two fingers, just as it was about to slip away.</t1873> <t1874>He felt the veins on the hand, sensed the heartbeat of an ill-fated heart in the wrist, and touched the palm where the lifeline was cut by the claw of death at the base of the thumb.</t1874>
<t1875>Then, he realized that she was not the woman he was expecting, because she smelled of flowers, not smoky steam, and she had tiny, unseen breasts like a man's chest, a crotch as hard and round as a walnut, and a tenderness tinged with the excitement of inexperience.</t1875><t1876>She was a virgin girl and her name was Santa Sofia de la Piedad.</t1876><t1877>Pilar Ternera had given her half of the money she had saved and set aside all her life, exactly fifty pesos, to do what she did to him.</t1877><t1878>Arcadio had seen her many times while she worked at his father's small cookshop, but he had never looked at her with interest; because the girl had the rare virtue of not making her presence felt to those around her except when necessary.</t1878><t1879>But after that day, Arcadio couldn't help but snuggle up to the warmth of her armpits like a cat.</t1879><t1880>When it was time for her siesta, she went to school.</t1880><t1881>Her parents knew and didn't say anything.</t1881><t1882>Pilar Ternera had given them the other half of her life savings as well.</t1882>
<t1883>Later, when the government troops evicted them from their love nests, they began to make love between the lard cans and corn sacks at the back of the shop.</t1883> <t1884>At the time Arcadio was appointed as the civil and military leader of the village, they had a daughter.</t1884> <t1885>The only relatives who knew about this situation were Jose Arcadio and Rebeca.</t1885> <t1886>During that period, Arcadio was close to them more out of a sense of complicity than kinship.</t1886> <t1887>Jose Arcadio had surrendered himself to the yoke of marriage.</t1887> <t1888>Rebeca's strong personality, insatiable appetite, and relentless ambition were draining all the strength from her husband, who had transformed from a woman-chasing idler into a beast of burden.</t1888> <t1889>They had a neat and tidy house.</t1889> <t1890>At sunrise, Rebeca would open up the entire house, and as the wind from the cemetery blew in through the windows and out through the doors into the garden, it would infuse the walls and furniture with the scent of graveyard saltpeter.</t1890> <t1891>Rebeca's craving for eating earth, the rattling of her parents' bones, and the boiling of her blood in the face of Pietro Crespi's ineptitude were all things of the distant past.</t1891> <t1892>Rebeca would sit by the window all day, embroidering, far removed from the anxieties of the war.</t1892> <t1893>When the dishes in the cupboard began to clink against each other, she would get up and start cooking.</t1893> <t1894>Long before the giant with boots, spurs, and a shotgun, sometimes with a deer slung over his shoulder, but more often with strings of wild ducks and rabbits dangling from his hands, appeared in the distance, Rebeca would have the meal ready.</t1894>
<t1895>One afternoon, during the early days of his administration, Arcadio showed up.</t1895> <t1896>They had not seen him since they left home, but he had such a sincere and friendly demeanor that Rebeca and Jose Arcadio did not hesitate to invite him to their table.</t1896>
<t1897>While they were eating their meals and drinking their coffee, Arcadio explained the reason for his visit.</t1897> <t1898>There was a complaint about Jose Arcadio.</t1898> <t1899>It was said that Jose Arcadio had started by plowing his own field, then driving the oxen forward, crushing fences and demolishing structures, he forcibly took over the most fertile lands in the area.</t1899> <t1900>He had also imposed a tribute on the owners of the lands he did not find appealing.</t1900> <t1901>Every Saturday, he would take his hunting dogs, sling his shotgun over his shoulder, and go out to collect the tribute.</t1901> <t1902>Jose Arcadio did not deny his actions.</t1902>
<t1903>-These lands were distributed by Jose Arcadio Buendia during the establishment of the village.</t1903> <t1904>In fact, it is said that his madness began at that time because he squandered this inheritance, which actually belonged to the family, and for this reason, he saw himself justified in seizing those lands.</t1904> <t1905>Such a defense was actually unnecessary, because Arcadio had not come to see justice served.</t1905> <t1906>He had come to negotiate with Jose Arcadio.</t1906> <t1907>In order for the title deeds of the seized lands to be transferred to Jose Arcadio, Arcadio would establish a cadastral office, and in return, Jose Arcadio would agree to let the local government representatives collect the tribute.</t1907> <t1908>They reached an agreement.</t1908> <t1909>Years later, while Colonel Aureliano Buendia was examining the title records, he saw that all the lands, including the cemetery, from the hill where Jose Arcadio's garden was located to as far as the eye could see, were registered in his brother's name.</t1909> <t1910>And he learned that during Arcadio's eleven-month rule, not only had he collected the tributes, but he had also taken money from the families of the deceased so they could bury their dead on Jose Arcadio's land.</t1910>
<t1911>Ursula learned about these events, which were the talk of the entire village, only a few months later.</t1911> <t1912>Everyone was hiding what had happened to avoid adding to her sorrow.</t1912> <t1913>At first, Ursula was suspicious.</t1913> <t1914>While she was giving her husband spoonfuls of pumpkin syrup, she said, supposedly with a puffed-up chest, Arcadio is building a house.</t1914> <t1915>She said it, but then she couldn't help but sigh and added, I don't know, but I have a feeling something is going to come out of this.</t1915> <t1916>Later, when she learned that Arcadio was not only building a house but also ordering furniture from Vienna, she became convinced that he was spending the money he had collected for public services.</t1916> <t1917>After a Sunday mass, when she saw Arcadio sitting in his new house playing cards with his officials, she shouted, You are the disgrace of our family!</t1917> <t1918>Arcadio paid her no mind.</t1918> <t1919>It was only then that Ursula learned he had a six-month-old daughter and that Santa Sofia de la Piedad, with whom he was living, was pregnant again.</t1919> <t1920>Upon this, she decided to find Colonel Aureliano Buendia wherever he was and write him a letter to inform him of what had happened.</t1920>
<t1921>However, the rapidly unfolding events of the days not only prevented Ursula from implementing her plans but also made her regret even thinking about them.</t1921> <t1922>Until then, the word war, which served only to describe a vague and distant event, suddenly became a concrete and dramatic reality.</t1922> <t1923>Towards the end of February, an old woman with an ashen face, riding a donkey loaded with brooms, arrived in Macondo.</t1923> <t1924>She had such a harmless appearance that the guards, thinking she was one of the vendors from the swamp villages, let her into the village without any questioning.</t1924> <t1925>The woman went straight to the barracks.</t1925> <t1926>Arcadio received her in the room that had once been a classroom.</t1926> <t1927>Now it had been turned into a sort of rear headquarters, with hammocks coiled and folded on hooks, beds piled in the corners, and rifles, carbines, and even hunting shotguns spread out on the floor.</t1927> <t1928>Before the old woman introduced herself, she straightened up, stood at attention, and gave a military salute.</t1928>
<t1929>-Lieutenant Colonel Gregorio Stevenson.</t1929>
<t1930>He had brought bad news.</t1930> <t1931>According to him, the last strongholds of the Liberals had also begun to fall.</t1931> <t1932>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, whom he had left fighting while retreating near Riohacha, had sent a message to Arcadio.</t1932> <t1933>He would surrender the village without resistance, on the condition that the lives and property of the Liberals would be protected.</t1933> <t1934>Arcadio looked pityingly at this strange messenger who resembled lost grandmothers.</t1934>
<t1935>"Of course, you brought something written," he said.</t1935>
<t1936>"Of course, I didn't bring anything like that," said the messenger.</t1936> <t1937>"You should know that under these circumstances, one cannot carry anything that would give them away."</t1937>
<t1938>While speaking, he reached into his bosom and took out a small fish made of silver.</t1938> <t1939>I think this is enough, he said.</t1939> <t1940>Arcadio recognized the fish as soon as he saw it, knowing it had come from Colonel Aureliano Buendía's hand.</t1940> <t1941>However, someone could have taken or stolen it before the war.</t1941> <t1942>A man could not be trusted blindly just because he had a silver fish in his bosom.</t1942> <t1943>The messenger went so far as to reveal a military secret to prove his identity.</t1943> <t1944>He explained that he had gone to Curaçao on duty, would gather all the exiles in the Caribbean region, and would find enough weapons and ammunition to launch an assault by the end of the year.</t1944> <t1945>Since Colonel Aureliano Buendía believed that this plan would succeed, he was against unnecessary loss of life at that moment.</t1945> <t1946>But Arcadio was adamant and unyielding.</t1946> <t1947>He arrested the messenger and had him shackled until he could prove his identity, deciding to defend the village to the last drop of his blood.</t1947>
<t1948>He didn't have to wait long.</t1948> <t1949>News of the Liberals' defeat was increasing day by day.</t1949> <t1950>Towards the end of March, at dawn when untimely rains were pouring down, the tense silence of the past weeks was broken by the bitter sound of a trumpet and the cannon noise that destroyed the church's tower.</t1950> <t1951>In fact, Arcadio's decision to resist was sheer madness.</t1951>
<t1952>Supposedly, he had fifty armed men, and each man had twenty bullets.</t1952> <t1953>Even so, former students, spurred on by Arcadio's boasts, had committed themselves wholeheartedly to the lost cause.</t1953> <t1954>Amid the sounds of boots on the roads, clashing commands, earth-shaking cannons, whizzing bullets, and the harsh sounds of bugles, a man called Colonel Stevenson found an opportunity to speak with Arcadio.</t1954> <t1955>"Don't humiliate me by making me die in women's clothing," he said.</t1955> <t1956>"If I'm going to die, let me die fighting."</t1956> <t1957>In the end, he managed to convince Arcadio.</t1957> <t1958>Arcadio ordered that he be given a weapon and twenty bullets, left five men with him to defend the headquarters, and went out with his men to lead the resistance.</t1958> <t1959>However, he couldn't reach the main road leading to the swamp.</t1959> <t1960>The barricades had been destroyed.</t1960> <t1961>The defenders of the village were fighting in the streets.</t1961>
<t1962>They fought with their rifles until they ran out of bullets, then drew their pistols against the rifles, and finally came to hand-to-hand combat, grappling throat to throat.</t1962> <t1963>Seeing the rout, some of the women took to the streets with sticks and bread knives they had grabbed.</t1963> <t1964>In that chaos, Arcadio, in his nightshirt and with José Arcadio Buendía's two old pistols in hand, encountered Amaranta, who was frantically searching for him.</t1964> <t1965>Arcadio gave his rifle to an officer who had lost his weapon in the fight and turned into a side street to take Amaranta home.</t1965> <t1966>Ursula was standing at the door, waiting for them, indifferent to the cannon fire that had made a huge breach in the adjoining house.</t1966> <t1967>The rain was letting up, but the streets were as slippery as if soap had been spilled on them, and in the darkness, distance could only be judged by eye.</t1967> <t1968>Arcadio left Amaranta with Ursula and tried to confront two soldiers who were firing from the corner.</t1968> <t1969>The old pistols, forgotten for years at the bottom of a drawer, did not fire.</t1969> <t1970>Ursula tried to pull Arcadio into the house, shielding him with her body.</t1970>
<t1971>"For God's sake, come!" he shouted.</t1971> <t1972>"This madness is enough!"</t1972>
<t1973>The soldiers took aim at them.</t1973>
<t1974>Someone shouted, "Leave that man alone, lady."</t1974> <t1975>Or else we won't intervene!</t1975>
<t1976>Arcadio pushed Ursula towards the house, then surrendered.</t1976> <t1977>Soon after, the gunfire ceased, and the bells began to ring.</t1977> <t1978>The resistance was broken in less than half an hour.</t1978> <t1979>Not a single one of Arcadio's men survived, but they had killed three hundred soldiers from the opposing side.</t1979> <t1980>The last point of resistance was the headquarters.</t1980> <t1981>Before the attack, a man named Colonel Gregorio Stevenson had released the prisoners in the headquarters and ordered his men to go out and fight in the streets.</t1981>
<t1982>His extraordinary agility and his ability to hit all twenty of his shots without missing gave the impression that the headquarters was defended by a multitude of people, causing the attackers to bombard the headquarters with cannonballs.</t1982> <t1983>The captain leading the attack was surprised when he saw no one among the ruins except a single dead body with a shattered arm, holding an empty rifle, and wearing nothing but underwear.</t1983> <t1984>The dead man's long hair, like that of a woman, was held at the nape of his neck with a comb, and there was a small fish pendant hanging from a chain around his neck.</t1984> <t1985>When the captain turned the corpse over onto its back with the toe of his boot and shone a light on its face, his astonishment grew even more.</t1985>
<t1986>"Oh my God!" he cried out.</t1986> <t1987>The other officers rushed to his side.</t1987>
<t1988>The captain said, "Look, who would have thought!"</t1988> <t1989>Gregorio Stevenson.</t1989>
<t1990>At dawn, by the decision of the hastily convened military court, Arcadio was executed by firing squad at the foot of the cemetery wall.</t1990> <t1991>He himself could not understand why the fear that had poisoned his life since childhood suddenly vanished in the last two hours of his life.</t1991> <t1992>Without attempting to show the courage he had displayed moments before, he listened indifferently to the accusations directed at him by the court.</t1992> <t1993>He remembered Ursula.</t1993> <t1994>He thought that at this hour she must be having her morning coffee with Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree.</t1994> <t1995>He thought of his eight-month-old daughter, who had not yet been named, and the child that would be born in August.</t1995> <t1996>He thought of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, whom he had left the evening before while salting the venison for the next day's meal; he missed her hair falling on her shoulders and her eyelashes that looked artificial.</t1996>
<t1997>As he was definitively settling his account with life, he wasn't getting emotional thinking about his own people; he was beginning to understand how he had actually loved the people he hated the most.</t1997> <t1998>When the president of the military court finished his speech, Arcadio realized that two hours had passed.</t1998> <t1999>Although we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate the charges, said the president, the defendant's irresponsible rashness, which led those under his command to unnecessary death, is enough to warrant the heaviest penalty.</t1999> <t2000>Arcadio found it absurd that he was preparing for his death a few steps away from the room where he first felt the anxiety of love, in the ruined classroom where he first tasted the security of power.</t2000> <t2001>He didn't care about death, but life meant a lot.</t2001> <t2002>Therefore, his feeling at the moment the death sentence was pronounced was not fear, but longing.</t2002> <t2003>He did not open his mouth until he was asked what his last wish was.</t2003>
<t2004>In a soft voice, he said, Tell my wife to name the girl Ursula.</t2004> <t2005>After pausing for a moment, he repeated: Like her grandmother's, Ursula.</t2005> <t2006>Then say that if the child to be born is a boy, they should name him Jose Arcadio, not to resemble his uncle, but to resemble his grandfather.</t2006>
<t2007>Before they took him to the wall where he would be executed by firing squad, Father Nicanor came to hear his confession.</t2007> <t2008>Arcadio said, I am not sorry for what I have done.</t2008> <t2009>And after drinking a cup of black coffee, he followed the command of the execution squad and set off.</t2009> <t2010>The name of the commander, who was unmatched in hasty executions, suited him well: Captain Roque Carnicero, which meant butcher.</t2010> <t2011>As they were heading to the cemetery, under the constant drizzle, Arcadio saw that a bright Wednesday was about to dawn on the horizon.</t2011>
<t2012>With the dawn, the pain of longing within him also dissipated and was replaced by curiosity.</t2012> <t2013>When they told him to lean against the wall, Arcadio saw Rebeca opening the door with her wet hair and pink nightgown.</t2013> <t2014>He tried to introduce himself.</t2014> <t2015>Rebeca glanced at the wall and froze in astonishment.</t2015> <t2016>She barely had time to wave to Arcadio.</t2016> <t2017>Arcadio waved back at her.</t2017> <t2018>At that moment, the smoking barrels of the rifles were aimed at him, and Arcadio heard Melquiades' words verbatim, the footsteps of untouched Santa Sofia de la Piedad in the dark classroom echoed in his ears, and he felt the icy stiffness he saw in Remedios' nostrils when she died in his own nose.</t2018> <t2019>Damn it! he had just enough time to think.</t2019> <t2020>I forgot to tell them to name the child Remedios if it’s a girl.</t2020> <t2021>Then, all the fear that had poisoned his entire life pierced his heart at once.</t2021> <t2022>The captain gave the order to fire: Arcadio barely had time to puff out his chest and lift his head, and he couldn't understand where the hot liquid scorching his groin was coming from.</t2022>
<t2023>"You sons of bitches!" he shouted.</t2023> <t2024>"Long live the Liberals!"</t2024>
<t2025>The war ended in May.</t2025> <t2026>Two weeks before the government announcement declaring that those who initiated the uprising would be ruthlessly punished, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was arrested while trying to cross the western border disguised as an Indian witch doctor.</t2026> <t2027>Of the twenty-one people who went to war following him, fourteen had died in combat, and six were wounded.</t2027> <t2028>At the moment of the final defeat, only one person remained by his side: Colonel Gerineldo Marquez.</t2028> <t2029>The news of Aureliano's capture was announced in Macondo through a special bulletin.</t2029> <t2030>Ursula ran to her husband's side.</t2030> <t2031>He's alive, she said.</t2031> <t2032>Let us pray to God to instill a sense of mercy in the hearts of his enemies.</t2032> <t2033>After crying her heart out for three days and three nights, Ursula heard her son's voice while making caramel in the kitchen.</t2033> <t2034>Running to the chestnut tree to inform her husband, she shouted, It was Aureliano's voice!</t2034> <t2035>I don't know what kind of miracle this is, but our son is alive, and we will see him in a few days.</t2035>
<t2036>Ursula was absolutely certain that she would see Aureliano.</t2036> <t2037>She had the floors scrubbed and rearranged the furniture.</t2037> <t2038>A week later, a rumor that was not confirmed by any official statement supported Ursula's prophecy.</t2038> <t2039>Colonel Aureliano Buendía had been sentenced to death, and his execution was to be carried out in Macondo as a lesson to the public.</t2039> <t2040>One Monday morning at ten-thirty, while Amaranta was dressing Aureliano José, she heard the distant sound of soldiers marching and the blare of a bugle.</t2040>
<t2041>One second later, Ursula burst into the room, shouting, They're bringing him!</t2041> <t2042>The soldiers tried to disperse the gathered crowd by hitting them with their rifle butts.</t2042> <t2043>Ursula and Amaranta pushed those around them aside, making their way to the corner, and they saw him.</t2043> <t2044>He looked like a beggar.</t2044> <t2045>His clothes were torn, and his hair was tangled with his beard.</t2045> <t2046>He was barefoot.</t2046> <t2047>He walked without feeling the heat of the scorching ground.</t2047> <t2048>His hands were tied behind his back with a rope.</t2048> <t2049>One of the mounted officers had tied the end of the rope to his horse's head.</t2049> <t2050>Along with him, they had also brought Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, who looked just as ragged and worn out.</t2050> <t2051>Neither of them was sad.</t2051> <t2052>The soldiers seemed uneasy with the cursing crowd.</t2052>
<t2053>Ursula, shouting "My son!" as she rushed forward through the crowd, slapped the soldier who tried to stop her.</t2053> <t2054>The officer's horse reared back in fright.</t2054> <t2055>Colonel Aureliano Buendia stopped.</t2055> <t2056>He was trembling with anger.</t2056> <t2057>Without approaching his mother who wanted to embrace him, he stared directly into her eyes.</t2057>
<t2058>Go home, mother, he said.</t2058> <t2059>Get permission from the authorities to see me in prison.</t2059>
<t2060>Then, he looked at Amaranta, who was standing hesitantly two steps behind Ursula, and smiled, "What happened to your hand?" he asked.</t2060> <t2061>Amaranta raised her hand wrapped in a black bandage.</t2061> <t2062>"It got burned," she said.</t2062> <t2063>He pulled Ursula back so the horses wouldn't trample her.</t2063> <t2064>The soldiers walked past.</t2064> <t2065>The prisoners were surrounded by special guards.</t2065> <t2066>These guards trotted their horses and took the prisoners to the prison.</t2066>
<t2067>In the late afternoon, Ursula went to see Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t2067> <t2068>She had tried to obtain permission to visit through Don Apolinar Moscote.</t2068> <t2069>However, the soldiers' control over the situation had tied Moscote's hands.</t2069> <t2070>Father Nicanor was writhing in pain because his liver was acting up.</t2070> <t2071>The family of Colonel Gerinaldo Marquez, who had not been sentenced to death, also tried to see their son, but the soldiers drove them away with rifle butts.</t2071> <t2072>When Ursula couldn't find anyone to take charge of the situation, she became convinced that her son would be executed at dawn, so she packed what she wanted to bring him and went to the prison alone.</t2072>
<t2073>She said to those at the door, "I am Colonel Aureliano Buendia's mother."</t2073>
<t2074>The guards blocked her way.</t2074> <t2075>Ursula insisted, "No matter what, I will get inside."</t2075> <t2076>She said, "If you have orders to shoot anyone who comes to the door, then fire without wasting any time," and pushed one of the guards aside, rushing into the room that used to be a classroom.</t2076> <t2077>In the room, a group of half-naked soldiers were sitting and cleaning their weapons.</t2077> <t2078>A red-cheeked officer with maneuver uniform, very thick glasses, and affected manners signaled the guards to step aside.</t2078>
<t2079>Ursula said again, "I am the mother of Colonel Aureliano Buendia."</t2079>
<t2080>The officer, with a friendly-looking smile, corrected her: "You mean to say that you are the mother of Señor Aureliano Buendia."</t2080>
<t2081>Ursula, "Whatever you say, whether it's señor or colonel, as long as I can see him," she conceded.</t2081>
<t2082>There were higher authority orders prohibiting visitors for those sentenced to death, but the officer took responsibility and granted Ursula a fifteen-minute visit.</t2082> <t2083>Ursula showed the officer what she had brought: A set of clean clothes, the short boots her son wore at his wedding, and the clotted cream candy she had been saving since she sensed his arrival.</t2083> <t2084>Ursula found Colonel Aureliano Buendia lying on a mattress spread out in the room used as a cell.</t2084> <t2085>Because his armpits were sore, he lay with his arms spread out to the sides.</t2085> <t2086>They had allowed him to shave.</t2086> <t2087>His thick mustache, with drooping ends, made his prominent cheekbones even more noticeable.</t2087> <t2088>To Ursula, Aureliano seemed paler, thinner, and more withdrawn than ever.</t2088> <t2089>He was aware of everything that had happened at home: Pietro Crespi's suicide, Arcadio's arbitrary behavior and execution, and Jose Arcadio Buendia's fearless life under the chestnut tree.</t2089>
<t2090>He knew that Amaranta's virgin widowhood, her dedication to raising Aureliano Jose, Aureliano Jose learning to read and write while learning to speak, and that he was a smart child.</t2090> <t2091>From the moment Ursula entered the room, she felt a sense of shyness in the face of her son's maturity, his commanding demeanor, and the aura of superiority that seemed to emanate from his very skin.</t2091> <t2092>She was astonished at how he knew everything so well.</t2092> <t2093>Aureliano teased his mother, "Haven't you always known that I'm a sorcerer?"</t2093> <t2094>Then, in a serious tone, he continued, "This morning, as they were bringing me here, I had the feeling that I had lived through all this before."</t2094> <t2095>Indeed, amidst the noise of the crowd, Aureliano had concentrated his thoughts and memories, surprised at how the village had deteriorated.</t2095> <t2096>The branches of the almond trees were broken.</t2096> <t2097>The houses, first painted blue, then red, had finally turned mottled.</t2097>
<t2098>Ursula sighed, "You didn't know how?"</t2098> <t2099>Time passes in the blink of an eye.</t2099>
<t2100>-It's true that it is so, he confirmed.</t2100> <t2101>But it can't be like this.</t2101>
<t2102>The long-awaited meeting, where both were prepared to ask questions and receive answers, thus turned into their usual daily conversations.</t2102> <t2103>When the guard came and announced that the meeting was over, Aureliano took out a bundle of yellowed papers from under the cushion.</t2103> <t2104>These were the poems he had written.</t2104> <t2105>Poems born out of his love for Remedios.</t2105> <t2106>Aureliano had written some of these in the past and had taken them with him when he left.</t2106> <t2107>He had written some of them on the battlefield, between two skirmishes.</t2107> <t2108>-Promise me you won't show these to anyone, he said.</t2108> <t2109>-By tonight, burn them all in the oven.</t2109> <t2110>After Ursula promised her son, she stood on her tiptoes to kiss him one last time.</t2110>
<t2111>"I brought you a gun," he murmured.</t2111>
<t2112>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, watching to see if the guard was looking at them, said, "It won't be of much use to me."</t2112> <t2113>"But you should give it to me anyway, just in case they search you on the way out."</t2113> <t2114>Ursula took the gun out from her bosom and quietly placed it under the cushion.</t2114> <t2115>Aureliano finished his words with absolute composure:</t2115>
<t2116>-Don't you dare try to say goodbye to me.</t2116> <t2117>Neither bow to anyone, nor plead with anyone.</t2117> <t2118>Act as if they had shot me a long time ago.</t2118> <t2119>Ursula bit her lip to keep from crying.</t2119> <t2120>Pointing to her armpits, she said, -Press hot stones on your wounds.</t2120>
<t2121>Then he turned and left the room.</t2121> <t2122>Colonel Aureliano Buendia stood until the door closed.</t2122> <t2123>He was pensive.</t2123> <t2124>Then he lay down again, spreading his arms out to the sides.</t2124> <t2125>Since the time he began to realize the power of his intuition in his teenage years, he believed that his death would be preceded by an indisputable, absolute sign.</t2125> <t2126>Yet, although only a few hours remained until his death, there was no such sign.</t2126> <t2127>Once, a very beautiful woman came to his camp in Tucurinca and asked the guards at the door for permission to see him.</t2127> <t2128>The guards, knowing that some mothers sent their daughters to the beds of famous warriors to improve and strengthen the lineage, let the woman in.</t2128> <t2129>That night, when the girl entered his room, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was writing a poem about a man lost in the rain.</t2129> <t2130>He turned his back to the girl to put away the papers in front of him into the drawer where he kept his poems.</t2130> <t2131>And at that moment, he sensed it.</t2131> <t2132>Without turning his head, he took the gun from the drawer.</t2132>
<t2133>"Please don't shoot," he said.</t2133>
<t2134>When he turned back after pointing his gun, the girl had lowered her own gun and was standing there, not knowing what to do.</t2134> <t2135>Aureliano Buendia had thwarted four out of the eleven traps set for him in this manner.</t2135> <t2136>However, someone unknown and uncaptured had entered the revolutionary headquarters in Manaure one night and had stabbed and killed his close friend Colonel Magnifico Visbal.</t2136> <t2137>That night, Aureliano had given his bed to Magnifico, claiming he was ill.</t2137> <t2138>Even though he was lying in a hammock just a few steps away in the same room, he had heard nothing.</t2138>
<t2139>Aureliano's efforts to make sense of his premonitions were in vain.</t2139> <t2140>His premonitions were suddenly felt with a supernatural clarity, appearing absolute and convincing for a moment, but they were incomprehensible.</t2140> <t2141>Sometimes they seemed so natural that Aureliano could only realize they were premonitions after the fact.</t2141>
<t2142>These were mostly trivial beliefs.</t2142> <t2143>However, when they sentenced him to death and asked for his last wish, he immediately sensed the premonition and quickly responded, I want the sentence to be carried out in Macondo.</t2143>
<t2144>The president of the military court was angry.</t2144>
<t2145>"Don't try to be cunning, Buendia," he had said.</t2145> <t2146>"This is a trick you're attempting to buy time."</t2146>
<t2147>Colonel, "Whether to fulfill it or not is up to you," he said.</t2147>
<t2148>-But this is my last wish.</t2148>
<t2149>Since that time, premonitions had ceased to visit him.</t2149> <t2150>On the day Ursula came to see him in prison, Aureliano thought long and hard and concluded that perhaps this time he would not be able to foresee his death.</t2150> <t2151>Because this time, death was not coming by chance; it was up to the will of those who would execute the sentence.</t2151> <t2152>He couldn't sleep all night due to the pain of his wounds and bruises.</t2152> <t2153>Near dawn, he heard footsteps outside.</t2153> <t2154>He muttered to himself, "They're coming," and thought of Jose Arcadio Buendia at the most inappropriate moment.</t2154> <t2155>At that moment, Jose Arcadio Buendia was also thinking of Aureliano in the morning darkness under the chestnut tree.</t2155> <t2156>Aureliano Buendia was not afraid, nor did he have a passion for life.</t2156> <t2157>Only the fact that this forced death prevented him from seeing the outcome of a multitude of unfinished tasks created a burning rage within him.</t2157> <t2158>The door opened, and the guard entered with a cup of coffee in his hand.</t2158> <t2159>The next day at the same time, while Aureliano was doing what he was doing at that moment, that is, going mad with rage from the pain under his armpits, the same thing happened again.</t2159> <t2160>On Thursday, Aureliano shared the sugar candy with the guards, wore the clean clothes that were too small for him, and put on the fine leather boots.</t2160> <t2161>By Friday, they still hadn't executed him by firing squad.</t2161>
<t2162>In fact, they didn't have the guts to carry out the execution.</t2162> <t2163>The rebelliousness of the village frightened the soldiers, and they feared that the execution of Colonel Aureliano Buendia would provoke reactions not only in Macondo but throughout the entire swamp region.</t2163> <t2164>Therefore, they consulted the authorities in the capital.</t2164> <t2165>While they awaited a response from the capital, on Saturday night, Captain Roque Carnicero, along with other officers, went to Catarino's shop.</t2165> <t2166>Only one of the women there, and that too because she was threatened, agreed to take the captain to her room.</t2166> <t2167>Then she explained, -They are afraid of sleeping with someone who they know will die soon.</t2167> <t2168>-No one knows how it will happen, but everyone knows that the officer who shoots Colonel Buendia and all the soldiers in the execution squad will be killed one by one, even if they go to the other end of the world.</t2168> <t2169>Captain Roque Carnicero told this to the other officers, and they hinted it to their superiors: Even though no one could say it openly, and even though the soldiers did not make any move to break that tense silence, by the time Sunday arrived, the entire village knew that the officers would resort to any means to avoid the responsibility of the execution.</t2169>
<t2170>The official order arrived with the Monday mail.</t2170> <t2171>The sentence was to be executed within twenty-four hours.</t2171> <t2172>That night, the officers put seven pieces of paper with their names written on them into a hat.</t2172> <t2173>Captain Roque Carnicero's unyielding misfortune showed itself once again when his name was drawn.</t2173> <t2174>The captain bitterly said, "If a man's luck isn't good from birth, it never will be."</t2174> <t2175>"Blind fate has clung to me since birth and won't let go until I die."</t2175> <t2176>At five in the morning, he also selected the firing squad by lot, lined them up in the courtyard, and woke the condemned man with a sentence that determined both of their fates.</t2176>
<t2177>-Let's go, Buendia, he said.</t2177> <t2178>-Our time is up.</t2178>
<t2179>Colonel, "So this is what it was," he replied.</t2179> <t2180>"I was just dreaming that my wounds were bursting open."</t2180>
<t2181>Rebeca, who learned that Aureliano would be executed by firing squad, got up at three in the morning.</t2181> <t2182>She sat in the bedroom in the dark and began to observe the cemetery wall through the ajar window.</t2182> <t2183>The bed she was sitting on was shaking violently from Jose Arcadio's snoring.</t2183> <t2184>Rebeca had spent the whole week in a secret and persistent wait, just as she once waited for Pietro Crespi's letters.</t2184> <t2185>Jose Arcadio was saying, "They can't execute him here."</t2185> <t2186>"So that no one knows who's in the firing squad, they shoot him in the barracks at midnight and bury him right there."</t2186> <t2187>Rebeca did not give up waiting.</t2187> <t2188>"They are stupid enough to kill him here," she said.</t2188> <t2189>She was so convinced this would happen that she had already figured out how to open the window to wave.</t2189> <t2190>Jose Arcadio insisted, "They can't take him through the streets."</t2190> <t2191>"Knowing that the people are willing to do anything, they wouldn't send him into the streets with six terrified soldiers."</t2191> <t2192>Ignoring her husband's reasoning, Rebeca did not leave the window.</t2192>
<t2193>"You'll see, they'll show you the foolishness of bringing it here," he said.</t2193>
<t2194>On Tuesday morning at five, while Jose Arcadio was drinking his coffee and letting the dogs out, Rebeca closed the window, holding onto the bed to keep from falling, and sighed, "They're bringing him."</t2194> <t2195>"He's so handsome."</t2195> <t2196>Jose Arcadio looked out the window and saw his timid state in the dawn twilight.</t2196> <t2197>They had already propped him against the wall.</t2197> <t2198>His hands were on his hips because the sores under his armpits prevented him from lowering his arms any further.</t2198> <t2199>Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, "A man can only disgrace himself this much."</t2199> <t2200>"Disgrace himself so much that he dies at the hands of six faggots, and there's nothing he can do about it."</t2200> <t2201>He repeated this with such passion that it deeply affected Captain Roque Carnicero.</t2201> <t2202>Because he thought he was praying.</t2202>
<t2203>When the soldiers took aim, Aureliano's anger had materialized into a bitter and unpleasant object that numbed his tongue and caused him to close his eyes.</t2203> <t2204>At that moment, the aluminum-colored glint of dawn disappeared from his sight, and Aureliano saw himself again in short pants.</t2204> <t2205>They had put a fancy necktie around his neck.</t2205> <t2206>On a beautiful afternoon, his father was holding his hand and leading him into a tent.</t2206> <t2207>And Aureliano was seeing ice.</t2207> <t2208>When he heard someone shouting, he thought the order to fire had been given to the firing squad.</t2208> <t2209>Expecting to be met by the hot tips of the bullets, he opened his eyes with a curious shiver.</t2209>
<t2210>However, he could see nothing but Captain Roque Carnicero standing with his arms raised and Jose Arcadio crossing to the opposite sidewalk with his shotgun ready to fire.</t2210>
<t2211>The captain said to Jose Arcadio, "Don't shoot, you were sent by God."</t2211>
<t2212>A new war began right there.</t2212> <t2213>Captain Roque Carnicero and six soldiers set out with Colonel Aureliano Buendia to rescue the revolutionary General Victorio Medina, who had been sentenced to death in Riohacha.</t2213> <t2214>They thought it would be shorter if they followed the path Jose Arcadio Buendia had taken to Macondo and headed into the mountains, but within a week they realized it was an impossible endeavor.</t2214> <t2215>As a result, they were forced to take the dangerous path filled with cliffs.</t2215> <t2216>They had no ammunition other than the bullets of the firing squad.</t2216> <t2217>They would camp near villages and towns, and one of them would disguise himself and go out to search for hidden Liberals with a small silver fish in hand.</t2217> <t2218>The Liberals would leave the next day under the pretense of going hunting and would not return.</t2218> <t2219>By the time they saw Riohacha through the mountains, General Victorio Medina had already been executed by firing squad.</t2219> <t2220>Colonel Aureliano Buendia's men promoted Buendia to the rank of general and made him the Commander of the Revolutionary Forces of the Caribbean Coast.</t2220> <t2221>Aureliano took on the role but stated that he could not accept the rank of general as long as the Conservative regime remained in power.</t2221>
<t2222>They were able to arm a force of over a thousand people within three months.</t2222> <t2223>But they were defeated.</t2223> <t2224>The survivors reached the eastern border.</t2224> <t2225>Then, it was heard that they had landed on Cabo de la Vela, considered one of the smaller islands of the Antilles.</t2225> <t2226>The government sent out proclamations by telegraph in all directions, and during this time, it was loudly announced that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had died.</t2226> <t2227>However, a telegram received two days later, as if to contradict the previous one, conveyed news of a new uprising in the southern plains.</t2227> <t2228>Thus, the legend of Colonel Aureliano Buendia appearing in various places at the same time was born.</t2228>
<t2229>At the same time, the conflicting news reported that Aureliano had won the battle in Villanueva, was defeated in Guacamayal, fell into the hands of the Motilon natives, was killed in one of the swamp villages, and launched an armed attack in Urumita.</t2229> <t2230>Meanwhile, the Liberals, who were negotiating to enter the House of Representatives, branded Aureliano as an adventurer and declared that he did not represent the party in any way.</t2230> <t2231>The national government declared him a bandit and put a price of five thousand pesos on his head.</t2231> <t2232>After sixteen defeats, Colonel Aureliano Buendia set out from Guajira with two thousand armed natives from head to toe, and the military unit he caught off guard while they were sleeping was forced to abandon Riohacha.</t2232> <t2233>Colonel Buendia established his headquarters there and declared a total war against the regime.</t2233> <t2234>In the first news he received from the government, it was reported that if he did not withdraw to the eastern border with his forces, Colonel Gerinaldo Marquez would be executed within forty-eight hours.</t2234> <t2235>At that time, Colonel Roque Carnicero, who was Aureliano's chief of staff, handed over the telegram with a stern face.</t2235> <t2236>But Aureliano read the telegram with unexpected joy.</t2236>
<t2237>"Oh man, how wonderful!" he exclaimed.</t2237> <t2238>"So, a telegraph office has opened in Macondo!"</t2238>
<t2239>Colonel Buendía's response to the government was definitive.</t2239> <t2240>He hoped to establish headquarters in Macondo within three months.</t2240> <t2241>If he did not find Colonel Gerinaldo Márquez alive, he would execute all the officers he held captive at that moment, starting with their generals, and order his subordinates to do the same throughout the war.</t2241> <t2242>Three months later, when he entered Macondo in a victorious atmosphere, the first person to greet and embrace him on the road was Colonel Gerinaldo Márquez.</t2242>
<t2243>The house was full of children.</t2243> <t2244>Ursula had taken in Santa Sofia de la Piedad with her eldest daughter and the twins born five months after Arcadio was executed.</t2244> <t2245>Ursula, not complying with the last wish of the young man who was senselessly sacrificed, had named the girl Remedios.</t2245> <t2246>"I believe this is what Arcadio would have wanted," she had concluded decisively.</t2246>
<t2247>-We will not name her Ursula, because those who bear this name cannot escape a lifetime of suffering.</t2247> <t2248>The twins were also named Jose Segundo and Aureliano.</t2248> <t2249>Amaranta was taking care of all of them.</t2249> <t2250>Small wooden chairs were lined up in the living room, and she gathered the neighbors' children to set up a kindergarten.</t2250> <t2251>When Colonel Aureliano Buendia entered the village amidst the ringing of bells and the noise of firecrackers, a children's choir greeted him at the door of the house.</t2251> <t2252>Aureliano Jose, who was tall like his grandfather, saluted him in a military manner, wearing a revolutionary officer's uniform.</t2252>
<t2253>Not all the news was good.</t2253> <t2254>A year after Colonel Aureliano Buendia's escape, Jose Arcadio and Rebeca moved into the house that Arcadio had built.</t2254> <t2255>No one knew that Jose Arcadio had halted the execution.</t2255> <t2256>In their new home, with its door open to guests and four windows open to the sun, located in the most beautiful corner of the area under the shade of an almond tree where nightingales nested, Rebeca and Jose Arcadio began to entertain their friends.</t2256> <t2257>Rebeca's old friends, including Moscote's four unmarried daughters, resumed their embroidery gatherings from where they had left off on the begonia-filled terrace.</t2257> <t2258>Jose Arcadio continued to receive income from the lands he had seized.</t2258> <t2259>The Conservative government also recognized his property rights.</t2259> <t2260>Every evening, he would return home on horseback, with hunting dogs and a shotgun, and rabbits strung on a rope hanging from his saddle.</t2260> <t2261>One September day, sensing that a storm was coming, he came home earlier than usual.</t2261>
<t2262>He greeted Rebeca in the dining room, tied the dogs in the yard, hung the rabbits in the kitchen to be salted later, and went into the bedroom to change his clothes.</t2262> <t2263>Rebeca later said that she was in the bathroom when her husband entered the bedroom and heard nothing.</t2263> <t2264>This was hardly believable.</t2264> <t2265>However, there was no more consistent evidence, and no one could see a reason for Rebeca to kill the man who made her happy.</t2265> <t2266>Perhaps this was the only mystery in Macondo that was never solved.</t2266> <t2267>As soon as Jose Arcadio closed the bedroom door, a gunshot echoed through the house.</t2267>
<t2268>The blood seeped under the door, passed into the living room, went out into the street, crossed the undulating road, went up and down the sidewalks, passed through Turkish Street, first turned right, then left, came right in front of the Buendia's house, slipped under the closed door, circled the walls to avoid dirtying the carpets, passed through the living room, entered the sitting room, made a wide arc around the dining table, extended to the terrace with begonias, slipped unnoticed under the chair of Amaranta, who was giving Aureliano Jose a math lesson, passed through the pantry, and entered the kitchen where Ursula was about to break exactly thirty-six eggs to bake bread.</t2268>
<t2269>Ursula exclaimed, "Oh my God! Oh my goodness!"</t2269>
<t2270>Tracing the paths through which the blood had flowed, she passed through the pantry, extended from the Begonia terrace where Aureliano Jose had said that three plus three plus three made nine, crossed the dining room and living rooms, and burst into the street, first turning right, then left onto Turkish Street. Forgetting that she had an apron on and slippers on her feet, she reached the square, entered a house she had never visited, pushed open the bedroom door, almost suffocated by the smell of burnt gunpowder, found Jose Arcadio lying face down on the gaiters he had taken off, and saw that the source of the blood seepage, already clotted, was in the man's right ear.</t2270> <t2271>They found no wounds on Jose Arcadio's body.</t2271>
<t2272>They couldn't seize the weapon either.</t2272><t2273>It was also impossible to rid the corpse of the smell of gunpowder.</t2273><t2274>First, they washed and scrubbed it three times with soap, then they rubbed every part of it with salt and vinegar, then they scrubbed it with lemon juice mixed with ashes, and finally, they submerged it in a barrel of water mixed with ashes and left it for six hours.</t2274><t2275>They scrubbed the body so much that Jose Arcadio's tattoos began to fade.</t2275><t2276>When nothing worked and, as a last resort, they thought of boiling the body for a day with black pepper, cumin seeds, and bay leaves, the corpse had already started to smell and decompose.</t2276><t2277>So they had to bury it in a hurry.</t2277><t2278>They placed it in a special coffin, two and a half meters long, one and a half meters wide, reinforced inside with iron plates and fastened with steel bolts, and sealed the lid tightly.</t2278><t2279>Yet, the streets through which the funeral procession passed were filled with the smell of gunpowder.</t2279><t2280>Father Nicanor, whose liver had swollen and stretched like a drum, recited the funeral prayer without getting out of his bed.</t2280>
<t2281>Even though they built thick walls around the grave and mixed mortar with compacted ash, sawdust, and quicklime over the following months, the smell of gunpowder lingered in the cemetery for years.</t2281> <t2282>The smell persisted until the engineers from the banana company came and covered the grave with a concrete lid.</t2282> <t2283>As soon as they took the body out of the house, Rebeca tightly shut the doors of her home and withdrew into a shell of indifference that no worldly pleasure could penetrate, burying herself alive in the house.</t2283> <t2284>She left the house once.</t2284> <t2285>When she was very old, during a heatwave when the Wandering Jew passed through the village and birds broke through the windows of bedrooms to die peacefully, Rebeca also went outside.</t2285> <t2286>She wore tarnished silver shoes and a hat made of small flowers.</t2286> <t2287>She was last seen when she took down a burglar who was forcing her door with a single shot.</t2287> <t2288>After that day, she had no contact with anyone except her servant and confidante, Argenida.</t2288> <t2289>At one point, there was a rumor that she wrote a letter to the bishop she called her cousin, but it was not mentioned whether she received any replies to her letters.</t2289>
<t2290>The townspeople eventually forgot him.</t2290> <t2291>Despite having returned in triumph, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was not at all pleased with the state of affairs.</t2291> <t2292>The government troops had abandoned their positions without any resistance, which had given the Liberals the impression that victory had been achieved.</t2292> <t2293>It was not right to shatter this belief.</t2293>
<t2294>However, the revolutionaries knew the true nature of the situation.</t2294> <t2295>Colonel Aureliano Buendia was also the person who understood the situation best.</t2295> <t2296>Although at that time he had over five thousand armed men under his command and two coastal provinces were under their control.</t2296> <t2297>Even so, Colonel Aureliano Buendia felt that they were trapped on the coastline, and all his thoughts and actions were in turmoil.</t2297> <t2298>In fact, when Aureliano ordered the repair of the church tower that had been destroyed by the government soldiers' artillery fire, Father Nicanor expressed his astonishment, saying, "What a ridiculous situation, the believers of Jesus are destroying the church, and the Freemasons are repairing it."</t2298>
<t2299>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, hoping to find a way out, would rush to the telegraph office, communicate for hours with the commanders of other towns, and finally return, once again convinced that the war had reached a deadlock.</t2299> <t2300>The news of new victories by the Liberals was spreading around with enthusiastic proclamations.</t2300> <t2301>However, when Colonel Buendia followed the operation on the map, he saw that his men were plunging into the forests, struggling with malaria and mosquitoes, and increasingly drifting away from reality.</t2301> <t2302>-We are wasting time, he would complain to his officers.</t2302> <t2303>While the scoundrels in the party are begging for seats in the assembly, we are wasting time here.</t2303>
<t2304>Once upon a time, he would lie down in the hammock in the room where he awaited death, thinking without blinking until dawn; he would imagine the lawyers dressed in black leaving the presidential palace in the morning chill, lifting their collars to their ears and rubbing their hands as they made their way to the all-night cafes; he would construct in his mind their debates about what the president meant when he said yes, what he meant when he said no, and even what he might be thinking when he said something else.</t2304> <t2305>Meanwhile, he was struggling with the overwhelming heat and mosquitoes, and he sensed that the dreadful dawn hour when he would have to give the command to his men to jump into the sea was approaching.</t2305>
<t2306>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, on a night when he was once again mired in doubts and anxieties, summoned Pilar Ternera, who was singing in the garden with the soldiers, to read his fortune.</t2306> <t2307>Pilar Ternera, after spreading and gathering the cards three times, simply said, "Watch your mouth."</t2307> <t2308>"I don't know what it means, but it's clear."</t2308> <t2309>"Watch your mouth."</t2309> <t2310>Two days later, someone gave a cup of coffee to one of the sentry soldiers, who passed the cup to another, and that one to another, and so on.</t2310> <t2311>The cup made its way from hand to hand until it reached Colonel Aureliano Buendia's room.</t2311> <t2312>The Colonel hadn't asked for coffee, but since it was there, he drank it.</t2312> <t2313>Inside the coffee was a dose of poisonous black nightshade seeds strong enough to kill a large stallion.</t2313> <t2314>When they carried him home, Aureliano was stiff as a board, his tongue hanging out between his teeth.</t2314> <t2315>Ursula waged a battle against death on his body.</t2315> <t2316>She made him drink purgative medicines and washed his stomach.</t2316>
<t2317>Then she wrapped him in thick blankets and fed him egg whites for two days until Aureliano's fever returned to normal.</t2317> <t2318>On the fourth day, Aureliano tore off the shroud.</t2318> <t2319>With the insistence of Ursula and her officers, he stayed in bed for another week.</t2319> <t2320>During that time, he learned that his poems had not been burned.</t2320> <t2321>Ursula explained, "I said, let me not rush."</t2321> <t2322>"When I went to light the oven that night, I said, let them bring the body first, for now, let it be."</t2322> <t2323>In the lethargy of the recovery days spent among Remedios's dusty dolls, Colonel Aureliano Buendia recalled the days that had shaped the course of his life by reading his poems.</t2323> <t2324>He started writing poetry again.</t2324> <t2325>He would sit for hours, writing poems, trying not to stumble in the face of the unexpected developments of a war with no future.</t2325> <t2326>In this way, he went back and forth to the other world.</t2326> <t2327>Eventually, his thoughts became so clear that he could see the front and back of everything.</t2327>
<t2328>One night to Colonel Gerineldo Marquez,</t2328>
<t2329>-I will ask you something, friend, he said.</t2329>
<t2330>-Why are you fighting?</t2330>
<t2331>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez,</t2331>
<t2332>"Why, of course?" he replied, "for the great Liberal Party, naturally."</t2332>
<t2333>-You're lucky because you know why you're fighting.</t2333> <t2334>As for me, it just dawned on me: I'm fighting to not tarnish bravery.</t2334>
<t2335>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez said, "This is a bad business."</t2335>
<t2336>Colonel Aureliano Buendia had liked his attitude.</t2336> <t2337>"True," he said.</t2337> <t2338>"But still, it's better than not knowing why you're fighting."</t2338> <t2339>He looked into his friend's eyes and completed his sentence with a smile: "Or like you, fighting for something that means nothing to anyone."</t2339>
<t2340>Until the party leaders openly declared him an outlaw, Aureliano could not bring himself to associate with armed gangs in the interior of the country.</t2340> <t2341>But as soon as he shed this reluctance, he knew he would break the vicious cycle of war.</t2341> <t2342>His illness gave him the opportunity to think.</t2342> <t2343>Then he deceived Ursula and took the gold she had buried and the money she had saved.</t2343> <t2344>He appointed Colonel Gerineldo Marquez as the civil and military leader of Macondo and went to establish connections with the gangs in the interior.</t2344>
<t2345>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was not only a close friend of Colonel Aureliano Buendia; Ursula treated him like a member of the family.</t2345> <t2346>Despite his frail build, innate elegance, and delicacy, he was still more inclined towards war than government affairs.</t2346> <t2347>His political advisors would lead him into theoretical dead ends and confuse him.</t2347> <t2348>Nevertheless, it was Marquez who ensured the peace and tranquility in Macondo that Colonel Aureliano Buendia dreamed of for his twilight years, which he would spend making silver fish.</t2348> <t2349>Although Marquez lived with his own parents, he would come to Ursula's for meals several times a week.</t2349>
<t2350>He taught Aureliano José how to handle a weapon and gave him his first military lessons.</t2350> <t2351>So that he could grow up and mature properly, with Úrsula's consent, he had the boy stay at the barracks for a few months.</t2351> <t2352>Years ago, when he was still a child, Gerineldo Márquez had told Amaranta that he loved her.</t2352> <t2353>At that time, Amaranta was so infatuated with Pietro Crespi that she just laughed it off.</t2353> <t2354>Gerineldo Márquez did not give up; he waited.</t2354> <t2355>Once, he wrote a letter to Amaranta from prison, asking for a dozen linen handkerchiefs with his father's initials embroidered on them.</t2355> <t2356>He also sent the money.</t2356> <t2357>A week later, Amaranta brought the handkerchiefs along with the money to the prison.</t2357> <t2358>They sat for a few hours reminiscing about old times.</t2358> <t2359>As Amaranta was about to leave, Gerineldo Márquez said, "When I get out of here, I will marry you."</t2359> <t2360>Amaranta laughed it off, but while teaching the children to read and write, she found herself thinking about Márquez and trying to rekindle the love she had felt for Pietro Crespi in her youth.</t2360>
<t2361>On Saturdays, the visiting day at the prison, they would stop by Gerineldo Marquez's house and go to see him with his parents.</t2361> <t2362>One of those Saturdays, Ursula was surprised to find him waiting by the oven for the fresh buns to come out.</t2362> <t2363>Amaranta was going to wrap the freshly baked bun in a napkin she had embroidered just for that purpose and take it to the prison.</t2363>
<t2364>Ursula said, "Marry him."</t2364> <t2365>"You won't find another like him."</t2365>
<t2366>Amaranta, indicating that she did not welcome this remark, replied, -I am not going to chase after men.</t2366> <t2367>-If I am taking these pastries to Gerineldo, it is only because I pity him for eventually being executed by firing squad.</t2367>
<t2368>Amaranta had spoken those words without thinking.</t2368> <t2369>Yet, at that very time, the government had threatened that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez would be executed if the rebels did not surrender Riohacha.</t2369> <t2370>Visits to the prison were cut off.</t2370> <t2371>Amaranta locked herself in her room.</t2371> <t2372>She cried day and night.</t2372> <t2373>She once again felt the guilt she had experienced when Remedios died, believing once more that her words had led to death.</t2373> <t2374>Her mother tried to comfort and calm her.</t2374> <t2375>She said that Colonel Aureliano Buendia would absolutely do something to prevent the execution, and promised that she herself would try to win over Gerineldo Marquez once the war was over.</t2375> <t2376>She fulfilled her promise sooner than she had planned.</t2376>
<t2377>When Gerineldo Marquez arrived, having added honor to his honor as both a civil and military leader, Ursula embraced him like a son, did a lot of things to make him feel at home, and prayed with all her might for Marquez to remind Amaranta of his marriage proposal.</t2377> <t2378>Her prayers seemed to have been answered.</t2378> <t2379>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, on the days he came to eat, did not leave immediately; he would sit with Amaranta on the terrace with begonias and play Chinese checkers.</t2379> <t2380>Ursula would bring them coffee, milk, and buns, and take the children away so they wouldn't disturb them.</t2380> <t2381>Amaranta was genuinely making an effort to rekindle the embers of her youthful love in her heart.</t2381> <t2382>With unbearable excitement, she eagerly awaited the days Gerineldo would come for dinner and the hours they would play Chinese checkers.</t2382> <t2383>As she moved the checkers pieces, her hands constantly trembled, and hours flew by next to the warrior whose name reminded her of the homeland of his ancestors.</t2383> <t2384>Nevertheless, on the day Colonel Gerineldo Marquez repeated his marriage proposal, Amaranta turned him down.</t2384>
<t2385>"I will not marry anyone," she said.</t2385> <t2386>"Especially not you."</t2386> <t2387>"You are in love with Aureliano, and since you cannot marry him, you are trying to marry me."</t2387>
<t2388>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was a patient man.</t2388> <t2389>"I will continue to resist."</t2389> <t2390>"Sooner or later, I will bring you to your senses," he said.</t2390> <t2391>He was still coming and going to the house.</t2391> <t2392>Amaranta would lock herself in her room, biting her lips to keep from crying, pressing her fingers to her ears to avoid hearing the voice of the man who wanted her, giving war news to Ursula.</t2392> <t2393>And although she longed to see him, she could never find the strength to face him.</t2393>
<t2394>At that time, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was sending a detailed report to Macondo every fifteen days.</t2394> <t2395>But he wrote to Ursula only once, and that was almost eight months after his departure.</t2395> <t2396>A special messenger brought the sealed envelope to the house.</t2396> <t2397>In the paper inside the envelope, the colonel, with his pearl-like handwriting, said, -Take good care of my father, because he is going to die.</t2397> <t2398>Ursula became alarmed.</t2398> <t2399>-If Aureliano says so, then it is so, she said.</t2399>
<t2400>And Jose Arcadio Buendia, as if being heavy wasn't enough, had learned to make himself even heavier whenever he wanted during the long time he spent under the chestnut tree.</t2400> <t2401>Seven people barely managed to lift him, and they had to drag him to his bed.</t2401> <t2402>The large, elderly man, sunburned and soaked by rains, filled the bedroom air with the scent of soft fungus, tree moss, and condensed open air as he breathed.</t2402> <t2403>The next morning, the old man was not in his bed.</t2403> <t2404>Despite his inexhaustible strength, Jose Arcadio Buendia was in no condition to resist.</t2404> <t2405>It was all the same to him.</t2405> <t2406>If he had gone back under the chestnut tree, it wasn't because he wanted to, but because his body had the habit of doing so.</t2406> <t2407>Ursula looked after him, fed him, and brought news from Aureliano.</t2407> <t2408>However, the only person Jose Arcadio Buendia could communicate with for a long time was Prudencio Aguilar.</t2408> <t2409>Prudencio Aguilar, who had aged considerably in the realm of the dead, would come twice a day, walking shakily, to chat with him.</t2409> <t2410>They would talk about cockfights.</t2410> <t2411>They would make plans to establish a large farm and raise purebred roosters.</t2411> <t2412>They had no intention of fighting them; the glory of cockfighting victories was long behind them.</t2412>
<t2413>Their main goal was to create a pastime to while away the endless markets of death.</t2413> <t2414>It was always Prudencio Aguilar who brought good news about an unknown person named Aureliano, who had cleaned and fed Jose Arcadio Buendia and had been promoted to colonel in the war.</t2414> <t2415>Jose Arcadio Buendia would amuse himself with the fantasy of endless rooms when he was alone.</t2415> <t2416>He would imagine getting out of bed, opening the door, and entering a second room with the same wrought-iron bed, the same rocking chair, and the same image of the Holy Virgin on the wall.</t2416> <t2417>He would open the door of that room and enter another identical one, and from there another identical one, and so on.</t2417> <t2418>Once Jose Arcadio Buendia entered these interconnected rooms that resembled the mirrored hall at the fair, he would wander around until Prudencio Aguilar came and touched his shoulder.</t2418>
<t2419>Then he would return the way he came, passing from room to room, from room to room, until he came to the real room to find Prudencio Aguilar.</t2419> <t2420>But one night, two weeks after they had moved him to the bed, Jose Arcadio Buendia, while in one of the intermediate rooms, felt Prudencio Aguilar touch his shoulder, and Buendia, thinking he was in the real room, stayed there forever.</t2420> <t2421>The next morning, as Ursula was bringing his breakfast, she encountered a man in the corridor.</t2421> <t2422>He was a short, stocky man.</t2422> <t2423>He was dressed in black, with a large black hat pulled down over his eyes.</t2423> <t2424>Ursula thought to herself, -My God, I could swear this is almost Melquiades.</t2424> <t2425>The man was Cataure, Visitacion's brother, who had fled the village during the insomnia plague and had not been heard from since.</t2425> <t2426>Visitacion asked him why he had returned.</t2426> <t2427>Cataure replied in their own language, which sounded like a hymn:</t2427>
<t2428>-I came to the king's funeral.</t2428>
<t2429>Then they entered Jose Arcadio Buendia's room, shook him with all their might, shouted loudly into his ear, held a mirror to his nostrils, but they couldn't wake him up.</t2429> <t2430>Not long after, while the carpenter was taking measurements for the coffin, they looked out the window and saw tiny yellow flowers falling like rain.</t2430> <t2431>The flowers rained down on the village in a silent downpour that lasted all night.</t2431> <t2432>They covered all the roofs, piled up in front of all the doors, and suffocated all the animals lying outside, killing them.</t2432> <t2433>So many flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets looked as if they were carpeted with thick rugs, and they had to shovel away the flowers to make way for the funeral procession.</t2433>
<t2434>Amaranta, having placed her embroidery on her knees, was sitting in the rocking chair, watching Aureliano Jose, whose face was covered in foam, sharpening his razor for his first shave.</t2434> <t2435>Aureliano Jose's adolescence was cut short; he nicked his upper lip while trying to shape his peach fuzz into a mustache, and after all this effort, what emerged was a child no different from before.</t2435> <t2436>Still, as she watched this great effort and struggle, Amaranta felt that she had begun to age at that very moment.</t2436>
<t2437>"You look just like Aureliano when he was your age," he said.</t2437>
<t2438>-You're a grown man now.</t2438> <t2439>Aureliano Jose had already grown up.</t2439> <t2440>He had grown up since the day Amaranta, still seeing him as a child, continued to undress in front of him in the bathroom as usual.</t2440>
<t2441>Since the day Pilar Ternera brought him to be raised, Amaranta would always undress in front of Aureliano Jose.</t2441> <t2442>When the child first saw her, the only thing that caught his eye was the deep hollow between her breasts.</t2442> <t2443>He was so innocent that he asked Amaranta why this hollow existed.</t2443> <t2444>Amaranta, pressing her fingertips to her breasts,</t2444>
<t2445>"They cut it off," he said.</t2445> <t2446>As time passed, and Amaranta seemed to forget the pain of Pietro Crespi's suicide and began bathing with Aureliano Jose again, the child no longer paid attention to the hollow between her breasts.</t2446> <t2447>Now, when he saw those beautiful breasts with their dark tips, he began to feel a strange shiver.</t2447>
<t2448>He continued to examine Amaranta, learning the miracle of her intimate places millimeter by millimeter, and just as Amaranta's skin shivered when she entered the water, Aureliano Jose began to shiver as he looked at her.</t2448> <t2449>Since his childhood, he would get up from his hammock at night and wake up in the morning in Amaranta's arms.</t2449> <t2450>When he lay down next to Amaranta, his fear of the dark would disappear.</t2450> <t2451>However, from the day he became aware of his own nakedness, the feeling that drew Aureliano Jose under Amaranta's mosquito net was not the fear of the dark, but the longing to hear Amaranta's warm breath at dawn.</t2451> <t2452>In the days when Amaranta rejected Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, one morning Aureliano Jose woke up with a start, thinking he had lost his breath.</t2452>
<t2453>He sensed Amaranta's fingers wandering on his stomach like warm and curious caterpillars.</t2453> <t2454>Pretending to be asleep, he turned in a way that made it easier for the fingers to wander.</t2454> <t2455>Then he felt the unbandaged hand dive into the sea of curiosity and excitement that was turning his head, like a blind oyster among the seaweed at the bottom.</t2455> <t2456>Ignoring what they both knew and that they knew it about each other, they entered into an unbreakable complicity after that night.</t2456> <t2457>Aureliano Jose couldn't sleep until the clock in the living room struck midnight, and the aging girl, whose skin was starting to fade, writhed until she heard the child she had raised slip under the mosquito net.</t2457> <t2458>He didn't even think that he would only temporarily alleviate his own loneliness.</t2458> <t2459>Later, not only did they lie naked, entwined, with breath-taking caresses; they began to chase each other around the house at all hours of the day, locking themselves in bedrooms in a state of constant, unfulfilled tension.</t2459>
<t2460>One day, they were almost caught by Ursula.</t2460> <t2461>They had hidden in the barn and were just about to kiss when Ursula came in and innocently turned to Aureliano Jose and asked, "Do you love your aunt very much?"</t2461> <t2462>Aureliano Jose said that he loved her very much.</t2462> <t2463>Ursula, saying "Good for you," measured the flour she had taken out of the sack for bread and returned to the kitchen.</t2463>
<t2464>This event pulled Amaranta out of the madness she had fallen into.</t2464> <t2465>She realized that she had gone too far, that what started as a kissing game with a child had turned into a passion of her later years; that it was dangerous and would lead nowhere, so she abruptly ended it.</t2465> <t2466>At that time, Aureliano Jose, who was about to complete his military training, finally faced reality and started living in the barracks.</t2466> <t2467>On Saturdays, he would go to Catarino's shop with the soldiers.</t2467> <t2468>In his sudden loneliness, his prematurely bursting adolescence, he sought solace in women who smelled of wilted flowers.</t2468> <t2469>He would fit these women into the image in his mind in the dark, straining his imagination to see them as Amaranta.</t2469>
<t2470>Shortly after, conflicting news about the war began to arrive.</t2470> <t2471>On one hand, the government was admitting that the uprising was growing and spreading; on the other hand, the officers in Macondo were receiving secret reports that negotiations should be held immediately and peace should be declared.</t2471> <t2472>In early April, a special envoy arrived for Colonel Gerineldo Marquez.</t2472> <t2473>The envoy confirmed that party leaders had established contact with rebel leaders in the interior of the country and were negotiating a ceasefire agreement in exchange for three ministerial seats for the Liberals, representation of the minority in the House of Representatives, and a general amnesty for rebels who laid down their arms.</t2473> <t2474>The envoy also brought a very secret order from Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who did not accept the terms of the ceasefire.</t2474> <t2475>According to the order, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was to take his five best men and leave the country.</t2475> <t2476>This order was to be carried out with absolute secrecy.</t2476> <t2477>A week before the announcement of the agreement, when there were conflicting reports from everywhere, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, along with ten trusted officers including Colonel Roque Carnicero, secretly arrived in Macondo after midnight, disbanded the military, buried the weapons, and destroyed the documents.</t2477>
<t2478>Before dawn broke, they left, taking Colonel Gerineldo Marquez and his five men with them.</t2478> <t2479>All of this happened so quickly and secretly that even Ursula only learned of it at the last moment, when someone tapped on her window and whispered, "If you want to see Colonel Aureliano Buendia, come to the door immediately."</t2479> <t2480>Ursula jumped out of bed and rushed to the door in her nightgown.</t2480> <t2481>She could barely make out the horsemen galloping away from the village, leaving a cloud of dust behind them.</t2481> <t2482>She only found out the next day that Aureliano Jose had gone with his father.</t2482>
<t2483>Ten days after the joint declaration by the government and the opposition that the war had ended, news came of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's first armed uprising on the western frontier.</t2483> <t2484>The colonel's numerically small and poorly armed force was repelled in less than a week.</t2484>
<t2485>That year, while the Liberals and Conservatives were placating the public with tales of reconciliation, Colonel Aureliano Buendia launched seven more uprisings.</t2485> <t2486>One night, he shelled Riohacha from a sailing ship.</t2486> <t2487>The soldiers jumped out of their beds and, in retaliation, executed fourteen of the town's leading Liberals.</t2487>
<t2488>Colonel Aureliano Buendia held one of the customs outposts at the border for more than two weeks and called for a general war across the nation.</t2488> <t2489>An expedition he undertook to wage war on the outskirts of the capital resulted in his men disappearing for three months during a frantic effort to clear a path through virgin forests over fifteen hundred kilometers deep.</t2489> <t2490>On one occasion, he approached within twenty kilometers of Macondo and had to retreat to the mountains after encountering government reconnaissance patrols.</t2490> <t2491>He was very close to the place where his father had found the remains of the Spanish galleon years before.</t2491>
<t2492>Visitacion died around that time.</t2492> <t2493>She had given up being a princess in her own tribe out of fear of the insomnia plague, and had attained the happiness of dying a natural death.</t2493> <t2494>She bequeathed that the monthly savings she had accumulated for over twenty years under her bed be unearthed and sent to Colonel Aureliano Buendia so he could continue the war.</t2494> <t2495>However, since news arrived that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had been killed while stationed near the provincial capital, Ursula did not bother to unearth the money.</t2495> <t2496>The government communiqué announcing the colonel's death - the fourth such announcement in the last two years - was taken as fact for up to six months, as there was no news from the colonel.</t2496> <t2497>Just as Ursula and Amaranta were about to add a new mourning to the past ones, unexpected news arrived.</t2497> <t2498>Colonel Aureliano Buendia was alive.</t2498> <t2499>However, he had given up dealing with his own country's government and had joined those working for the federation of other republics in the Caribbean.</t2499>
<t2500>Each time, he appeared under different names and each time in a place a little farther from his country.</t2500> <t2501>It was later learned that his idea at the time was to unite the federalist forces in Central America and to sweep away all conservative regimes from Alaska to Patagonia.</t2501>
<t2502>The first direct news Ursula received from him was a letter sent from the city of Santiago in Cuba a few years after his departure, which reached his mother after passing from hand to hand, yellowing and crumpling along the way.</t2502> <t2503>When Ursula read the letter, she exclaimed, "We have completely lost him."</t2503> <t2504>"At this rate, he will spend Christmas on the other side of the world."</t2504> <t2505>The person to whom Ursula said these words and first showed the letter was Conservative General Jose Raquel Moncada, who had been the mayor of Macondo since the end of the war.</t2505> <t2506>General Moncada expressed his opinion, "It's a pity that this Aureliano is not a Conservative."</t2506>
<t2507>He truly admired her.</t2507> <t2508>Like most conservative civilians, Jose Raquel Moncada had joined the war to defend his party and, despite not being a professional officer, he had earned the title of general due to his usefulness on the battlefield.</t2508> <t2509>However, like most of his colleagues in the party, he was against the war.</t2509> <t2510>He viewed soldiers as idle individuals with no principles, greedy schemers, and experts at intimidating civilians to live in luxury during times of chaos.</t2510> <t2511>Moncada, cultured, intelligent, pleasant, rosy-cheeked, and fond of food and cockfights, was once considered Colonel Aureliano Buendia's most feared rival.</t2511> <t2512>He had managed to establish his own authority over professional officers in the vast region along the coast.</t2512> <t2513>On one occasion, when he was forced to withdraw from a region they held due to strategic circumstances, he left two letters for Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t2513>
<t2514>In one of the rather long letters, he was calling on the colonel to join the campaign to conduct the war under more humane conditions.</t2514> <t2515>He had written the second letter to his wife, who was in the region dominated by the Liberals, and placed it next to the colonel's letter with the hope that it would be delivered.</t2515> <t2516>From that day on, even during the bloodiest periods of the war, the two commanders would occasionally cease fire and exchange war prisoners.</t2516> <t2517>These ceasefire periods became breathers that brought a certain festive atmosphere, and General Moncada took advantage of these opportunities to teach Colonel Aureliano Buendia how to play chess.</t2517> <t2518>They became good friends.</t2518> <t2519>Gradually, they even planned to unite the beloved and respected elements of both parties, to free the soldiers from the influence of professional politicians, and to establish a humane order that encompassed the best aspects of each doctrine.</t2519> <t2520>After the war, while Colonel Aureliano Buendia was trying to navigate the harsh paths of successive defeats, General Moncada was appointed as a justice of the peace.</t2520>
<t2521>He took off his uniform and put on civilian clothes, replaced the soldiers with unarmed police officers, implemented amnesty laws, and helped the families of a few Liberals who died in the war.</t2521> <t2522>He ensured that Macondo became a district and thus became its first mayor.</t2522> <t2523>And he brought security, peace, and order to the people to such an extent that they thought the war was a meaningless nightmare of the past.</t2523> <t2524>Father Coronel, who had participated in the first federalist war and was nicknamed Bear Fish, replaced Father Nicanor, who died of liver disease.</t2524> <t2525>Bruno Crespi, who married Amparo Moscote and developed his music instruments and toy shop day by day, had a theater built.</t2525> <t2526>Spanish theater companies on tour began to give performances there.</t2526> <t2527>The open-air theater consisted of wooden benches, a stage with velvet curtains adorned with Greek masks, and three ticket booths shaped like lion heads.</t2527> <t2528>Tickets were obtained from the lion's mouth.</t2528>
<t2529>At around this time, the school was also rebuilt.</t2529> <t2530>Don Melchor Escalona, who was brought in from the swampy region, was put in charge of the school.</t2530> <t2531>Escalona made lazy students walk on their knees in the lime-plastered courtyard and filled the mouths of those who talked during class with hot pepper.</t2531> <t2532>The children's parents did not object to these actions.</t2532>
<t2533>The mischievous twins of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, Aureliano Segundo and Jose Arcadio Segundo, were the first students to arrive in class with their slate boards, chalks, and aluminum canteens with their names written on them.</t2533>
<t2534>Remedios, who had inherited her mother's unique beauty, became known as Beautiful Remedios.</t2534> <t2535>Despite time, successive periods of mourning, and a heap of sorrows, Ursula resisted aging.</t2535> <t2536>With the help of Santa Sofia de la Piedad, Ursula accelerated her pastry-making again, and within a few years, not only did she rebuild the fortune her son had squandered in the war, but she also refilled the jars buried in the bedroom with glittering gold.</t2536> <t2537>"As long as God gives me life, there will be no shortage of money in this madhouse," she said.</t2537> <t2538>It was during this time that Aureliano Jose, having fled the federal troops in Nicaragua and signed on as a crew member of a German ship, appeared in the kitchen of the house.</t2538>
<t2539>Aureliano Jose was as strong as a horse, as dark-skinned as a native, and had long hair, and he had secretly decided to marry Amaranta.</t2539> <t2540>When Amaranta saw him come in, she understood why he had come, even though he hadn't said anything yet.</t2540> <t2541>They couldn't look each other in the face at the table.</t2541> <t2542>However, two weeks after his arrival, Aureliano Jose, in front of Ursula, staring into Amaranta's eyes, suddenly said, "I've always thought of you."</t2542> <t2543>Amaranta kept her distance from him, avoided unexpected encounters, and tried to keep Beautiful Remedios by her side.</t2543> <t2544>When her nephew asked her how long she intended to keep the black bandage on her hand, she blushed with shame.</t2544> <t2545>Because she saw this bandage as a symbol of her virginity.</t2545> <t2546>After Aureliano Jose arrived, Amaranta began to bolt the door of her bedroom.</t2546> <t2547>However, hearing the comfortable snores coming from the adjacent room every night, she eventually forgot to bolt the door.</t2547> <t2548>About two months after Aureliano Jose's arrival, one morning Amaranta heard him enter the room.</t2548> <t2549>Then, instead of screaming or running away as she had previously thought she would, she sank into a soft comfort.</t2549>
<t2550>He heard Aureliano José slip under the mosquito net as he always did when he was a child, and when he realized the young man was completely naked, he couldn't stop himself from breaking out in a cold sweat and his teeth chattering.</t2550> <t2551>Breathless with curiosity, he whispered, -Go away, or I'll scream.</t2551> <t2552>However, Aureliano José knew exactly what he had to do.</t2552> <t2553>Because he was no longer a child; he had become a barracks stallion.</t2553> <t2554>That night, the silent and noisy struggles began again and lasted until dawn.</t2554> <t2555>Amaranta, losing herself, said, -I am your aunt.</t2555> <t2556>-I am practically your mother, not just because I am older, but because the only thing I didn't do was breastfeed you; beyond that, I mothered you, she said.</t2556> <t2557>Aureliano would leave at dawn, come back the next morning, and each time he came, he was even more excited by the fact that Amaranta didn't bolt the door.</t2557> <t2558>His desire for her had not diminished for a moment.</t2558>
<t2559>In the dark bedrooms of the occupied cities, in the most wretched of bedrooms, he had found Amaranta, sensed Amaranta in the dried blood smell of the bandages of the wounded, lived Amaranta in the momentary terror of the danger of death, dreamed of her everywhere, all the time.</t2559> <t2560>He had fled from her to forget her; not only going far away but also throwing himself forward with a fury that his comrades called recklessness, yet the more he tried to bury Amaranta's image in the filth of war, the more the war resembled Amaranta.</t2560> <t2561>During his time in hiding, Aureliano Jose had writhed in these pains, seeking ways to kill himself and thus kill the image of Amaranta.</t2561> <t2562>One day, he had listened to a tale from an old man.</t2562> <t2563>In the tale, the man marries his aunt, who is also his uncle's daughter, and in the end, his son becomes his own grandfather.</t2563>
<t2564>Aureliano Jose had escaped from the barracks and come back two weeks after this incident.</t2564> <t2565>He found Amaranta more worn out, more withdrawn, more timid, and curled up at the last corner of maturity than he had imagined, but in the darkness of the bedroom, more passionate than ever, more aggressively defiant in her resistance than ever.</t2565> <t2566>As Amaranta undressed in his hand caresses, she said, "You are a monster."</t2566> <t2567>"You can't do these things to your poor aunt unless you get special permission from the Pope."</t2567> <t2568>Aureliano Jose promised to go to Rome; Amaranta said she would walk across Europe on her knees to kiss the Pope's sandals so that he would lower the drawbridge of the castle.</t2568>
<t2569>Amaranta was protesting, "This doesn't end here."</t2569> <t2570>"If we have a child, it will have a tail like a pig."</t2570>
<t2571>Aureliano Jose paid no attention to these words.</t2571>
<t2572>"Even if you give birth to a thorny lizard, it wouldn't matter," he was saying.</t2572>
<t2573>Aureliano Jose, in the early morning, unable to bear the pain of unrelieved manhood, went to Catarino's shop.</t2573> <t2574>He found a woman with sagging breasts, affectionate and vulgar.</t2574> <t2575>The woman temporarily quenched his hunger.</t2575> <t2576>He also began to try the tactic of disdain towards Amaranta.</t2576> <t2577>He would see Amaranta sitting on the terrace, working at the sewing machine she had quickly mastered, and wouldn't even greet her.</t2577> <t2578>Amaranta compared herself to a boat narrowly escaping crashing into the rocks and couldn't understand why she started thinking about Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, why she nostalgically remembered the days they played Chinese checkers, and why she imagined Gerineldo as the man in her bedroom.</t2578> <t2579>Aureliano Jose, however, did not realize the great defeat he faced the night he could no longer endure the comedy of indifference and returned to Amaranta's room.</t2579> <t2580>Amaranta, with unshakable and unwavering determination, turned him away and bolted her door for life.</t2580>
<t2581>A few months after Aureliano Jose's return, a flamboyant woman, smelling of jasmine, arrived at the door holding the hand of a five-year-old boy.</t2581> <t2582>She said that the boy was the son of Colonel Aureliano Buendia and that she had brought him to Ursula to be baptized.</t2582> <t2583>No one doubted the lineage of the unnamed child: He was the spitting image of the colonel.</t2583> <t2584>It was exactly like the time when Aureliano first saw ice.</t2584> <t2585>The woman described how the child was born: He was born with his eyes wide open.</t2585> <t2586>As soon as he was born, he fixed his eyes, which looked like those of a grown man, on the people around him, as if he were judging them.</t2586> <t2587>His unblinking stare frightened his mother.</t2587>
<t2588>Ursula, "Just like him," she said.</t2588> <t2589>"The only thing missing is that he can't move the chairs with a glance."</t2589>
<t2590>They gave the child the name Aureliano and his mother's surname.</t2590> <t2591>Because according to the laws, until his father officially recognized him, the child could not take his father's surname.</t2591> <t2592>General Moncada became his godfather.</t2592> <t2593>Amaranta insisted a lot that she stay with them to take on the child's upbringing, but the child's mother opposed this.</t2593>
<t2594>Ursula had not yet heard of the custom of sending virgins into the arms of soldiers, just as hens are let loose among roosters.</t2594> <t2595>But she learned it well within that year.</t2595> <t2596>Colonel Aureliano Buendia's nine sons were brought home to be baptized.</t2596> <t2597>The eldest, a dark-skinned, green-eyed boy who did not resemble his father at all, was no more than ten years old.</t2597> <t2598>They kept bringing children of every age and color, but all of them were boys and left no doubt about their paternity.</t2598> <t2599>Among those who came, only two showed distinct characteristics.</t2599> <t2600>One was large for his age and broke every piece of crockery and every pot in the house.</t2600> <t2601>It was as if his hands had the ability to break everything they touched.</t2601> <t2602>The other was a fair-haired boy with light-colored eyes like his mother.</t2602> <t2603>His hair was grown long and curled like a girl's.</t2603> <t2604>He entered the house with a familiarity as if he had been raised there, went straight to the console in Ursula's room, and said, "I want the wind-up ballerina."</t2604>
<t2605>Ursula was taken aback.</t2605> <t2606>She opened the drawer, rummaged through the old, dusty knick-knacks from Melquiades' time, and found the wind-up ballerina wrapped in a pair of socks.</t2606> <t2607>Pietro Crespi had brought it to the house, and then everyone had forgotten about it.</t2607> <t2608>Within less than twelve years, the seventeen sons that the colonel had fathered on his battlefield were baptized with the name Aureliano and their mothers' surnames.</t2608> <t2609>At first, Ursula would fill the pockets of those who came with money, and Amaranta would try to keep them at home.</t2609> <t2610>But eventually, they started to be content with giving them gifts and becoming their godmothers.</t2610> <t2611>Ursula would record the mother's name, address, and the child's place and date of birth in a large ledger, saying, "By baptizing them, we have done our part."</t2611> <t2612>She would say, "We need to keep the records well so that when Aureliano comes, he can make a decision easily."</t2612>
<t2613>While Ursula was discussing this surprising reproduction issue with General Moncada at dinner one day, she hinted that Colonel Aureliano Buendia deeply wished to return one day and gather all his sons at home.</t2613>
<t2614>General Moncada said, "Do not worry, my dear friend, Aureliano will return sooner than you think."</t2614>
<t2615>The truth that General Moncada knew at that moment and did not want to explain was that Colonel Aureliano Buendia was on his way to lead the longest, most relentless, and bloodiest uprising he had ever undertaken until that day.</t2615>
<t2616>The situation became tense again, just like in the months before the first war.</t2616> <t2617>The cockfights, which were held under the protection of the mayor, were suspended.</t2617> <t2618>Captain Aquiles Ricardo, the Garrison Commander, took over the mayoral duties.</t2618> <t2619>The Liberals viewed him as a provocateur.</t2619> <t2620>Ursula said to Aureliano Jose, "Bad things are going to happen."</t2620> <t2621>"Don't go out after six in the evening."</t2621> <t2622>However, no matter how much Ursula pleaded, she couldn't make him listen.</t2622> <t2623>Just as Arcadio once did, Aureliano Jose had also ceased to belong to her.</t2623> <t2624>It seemed that the possibility of living without worrying about daily subsistence, upon returning home, had awakened in him the lazy and profligate tendencies of his uncle, Jose Arcadio.</t2624> <t2625>His passion for Amaranta had passed without leaving a trace.</t2625> <t2626>He wandered aimlessly, played billiards, passed his loneliness with transient women, and plundered the money Ursula had hidden and forgotten.</t2626> <t2627>Eventually, he only stopped by the house to change his clothes.</t2627> <t2628>Ursula complained, "They are all the same."</t2628> <t2629>"At first, their manners and gentlemanliness are impeccable."</t2629> <t2630>"They listen, do whatever they are told, and seem incapable of hurting even an ant."</t2630> <t2631>"But as soon as their beards grow, their morals deteriorate," she grumbled.</t2631>
<t2632>Unlike Arcadio, who never learned who his real parents were, Aureliano Jose found out that he was the son of Pilar Ternera.</t2632> <t2633>The woman had prepared a hammock for him to take his afternoon naps in her house.</t2633> <t2634>Beyond being mother and son, they shared their loneliness.</t2634> <t2635>Pilar Ternera had lost all her hopes.</t2635> <t2636>She had forgotten the resonance of her laughter, which had turned into the heavy strokes of an organ, her breasts had been ruined by endless squeezes, and she had fallen victim to the inevitable fate of a woman whose belly and hips were shared.</t2636> <t2637>Yet, her heart had aged without hardening.</t2637> <t2638>She had become like a plump, talkative, self-indulgent maternal housewife, had cast aside the empty dreams of the cards, and had begun to find peace and solace in the loves of others.</t2638> <t2639>In the house where Aureliano Jose took his afternoon naps, the neighboring girls would meet with their lovers.</t2639> <t2640>After entering without question, they would say, -Pilar, can we use your room for a while?</t2640>
<t2641>Pilar would respond to them, "Of course, by all means," and if there was someone else at home, she would turn to them and explain, "I too am happy to know that people are happy in bed."</t2641>
<t2642>He wouldn't take any money in return for this service.</t2642> <t2643>Even in her old age, she never turned away men who came looking for her, without giving money, without giving love, and always without giving pleasure, nor did she ever turn away girls who wanted her room.</t2643> <t2644>All five of her daughters, each a legacy of a passionate seed, had grown up and gotten lost in the intricate paths of life.</t2644> <t2645>One of the two sons Pilar had raised and brought up had died fighting after joining Colonel Aureliano Buendia's forces, while the other had been caught and injured at the age of fourteen while trying to steal a crate of chicks from a village in the swamp.</t2645> <t2646>In a way, Aureliano Jose was the tall, dark man that the tarot priest had foretold for her half a century ago, and like all the men brought by the cards, he reached Pilar's heart after being marked by death on his forehead.</t2646> <t2647>The woman saw in the cards that he was destined for death.</t2647>
<t2648>"Don't go out tonight," he said.</t2648> <t2649>"Stay here."</t2649> <t2650>"Besides, Carmelita Montiel keeps begging me to put her in your arms."</t2650>
<t2651>Aureliano Jose could not grasp the hidden plea in those words.</t2651>
<t2652>-Tell her to wait for me at midnight, he said.</t2652>
<t2653>He went to the theater.</t2653> <t2654>A Spanish troupe was performing 'The Dagger of the Fox'.</t2654> <t2655>In fact, it was Zorrilla's play called The Dagger of the Goths.</t2655> <t2656>However, since the Liberals had nicknamed the Conservatives as Goths, Captain Aquiles Ricardo had changed the name of the play.</t2656> <t2657>Aureliano Jose only noticed that Captain Aquiles Ricardo and two soldiers with rifles were searching the audience after he went to the door and got his ticket.</t2657>
<t2658>Aureliano Jose, "Take it easy, captain."</t2658> <t2659>"No man born of a woman has dared to lay a hand on me," he said.</t2659> <t2660>The captain tried to search him by force, and the unarmed Aureliano Jose began to flee.</t2660> <t2661>The soldiers did not obey the order to shoot.</t2661> <t2662>One of them tried to explain, "He is a Buendia."</t2662> <t2663>Blinded by rage, the captain snatched the rifle from the soldier's hands, stood in the middle of the street, and took aim.</t2663> <t2664>"Cowards!" he shouted.</t2664> <t2665>"I wish it were Colonel Aureliano Buendia himself!"</t2665> <t2666>As the gunshot echoed, twenty-year-old untouched Carmelita Montiel, freshly bathed in orange blossom-scented water, was sprinkling rosemary leaves on Pilar Ternera's bed.</t2666>
<t2667>If it were up to Aureliano Jose, he would find the happiness Amaranta denied him in her.</t2667> <t2668>They would have exactly seven beautiful children.</t2668> <t2669>Aureliano Jose would spend many years with her and die of natural causes in her arms in his old age.</t2669> <t2670>However, the bullet that buried itself in his back and shattered his chest must have been fired due to a misinterpretation of the cards.</t2670> <t2671>According to the fortune, the one who was supposed to die that night was Captain Aquiles Ricardo, who indeed died four hours before Aureliano Jose.</t2671> <t2672>As soon as the gunshot was heard, the captain fell to the ground, hit by two bullets fired simultaneously from an unknown direction, and the night was interrupted by loud voices: "Long live the Liberal Party!"</t2672> <t2673>"Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendia!" At midnight, when Aureliano Jose died from blood loss and the fortune read for Carmelita Montiel proved false, a crowd of over four hundred gathered in front of the theater and emptied their pistols into the corpse of Captain Aquiles Ricardo, left in the middle of the street.</t2673> <t2674>His body, weighed down by the bullets and crumbling like soaked bread, was carried away by a patrolman with a wheelbarrow.</t2674>
<t2675>Annoyed by the excesses of career soldiers, General Jose Raquel Moncada used his political influence, donned his uniform again, and took control of the military and civil administration of Macondo.</t2675> <t2676>However, he hoped that his conciliatory attitude would prevent the inevitable.</t2676> <t2677>In September, various reports came in.</t2677> <t2678>While the government claimed to have control of the situation throughout the country, secret reports to the Liberals indicated armed uprisings in the interior.</t2678> <t2679>Those in power were reluctant to declare a state of war.</t2679> <t2680>However, following the court-martial decision that sentenced Colonel Aureliano Buendia to death in absentia, the situation was announced in a government communiqué.</t2680> <t2681>The first unit to capture the Colonel was ordered to execute the sentence.</t2681> <t2682>Ursula joyfully said to General Moncada, "This means he has returned."</t2682>
<t2683>However, Moncada had no knowledge of this matter.</t2683> <t2684>In fact, Colonel Aureliano Buendia had returned to the country more than a month ago.</t2684> <t2685>Before his arrival, various rumors had spread, claiming that the colonel was in several distant places at the same time, and even General Moncada did not believe he had returned until it was officially announced that he had captured two towns in the coastal region.</t2685> <t2686>Showing the telegram containing the official statement to Ursula, -Congratulations, dear friend.</t2686> <t2687>He will be here soon, he said.</t2687> <t2688>At that moment, Ursula became anxious for the first time.</t2688> <t2689>-What will you do? she asked.</t2689> <t2690>General Moncada had asked himself the same question many times.</t2690> <t2691>-I will do what he does, my friend, he said.</t2691> <t2692>I will fulfill my duty.</t2692>
<t2693>On the first of October, at dawn, Colonel Aureliano Buendia marched on Macondo with a thousand men, armed from head to toe.</t2693> <t2694>The garrison was ordered to hold out to the end.</t2694> <t2695>At noon, while General Moncada was having lunch with Ursula, a cannonball, whose rumble echoed throughout the town, shattered the facade of the treasury.</t2695>
<t2696>General Moncada sighed, "They are as well-armed as we are."</t2696> <t2697>"Moreover, they are fighting willingly and with conviction."</t2697> <t2698>At two in the afternoon, when the earth shook with the mutual artillery fire of both sides, General Moncada, certain that he was continuing a battle he believed lost from the start, asked Ursula for permission to leave.</t2698> <t2699>"I pray to God that Aureliano is not at home tonight."</t2699> <t2700>"If that happens, embrace him in my place."</t2700> <t2701>"Because I don't think I will see him again," he said.</t2701>
<t2702>That night, after writing a long letter to Colonel Aureliano Buendía, reminding him of their common goal to humanize the war and wishing for the complete defeat of the army's corruptions and the passions of politicians on both sides, General Moncada was captured while trying to escape from Macondo.</t2702> <t2703>The next day, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had a meal with the general at Ursula's house.</t2703> <t2704>He would stay there until the court-martial made a decision about him.</t2704>
<t2705>They were sitting in a great atmosphere of friendship.</t2705><t2706>However, while they reminisced about the old days and forgot the war, Ursula kept feeling a bitter emotion, repeatedly telling herself that her son was like an uninvited guest and didn't belong there.</t2706><t2707>Ursula had felt this way the moment she saw her son being escorted inside by a noisy group of soldiers.</t2707><t2708>The soldiers had turned the whole house upside down, even reaching the bedrooms, to ensure there was no danger for the colonel.</t2708><t2709>Colonel Aureliano Buendia not only accepted their behavior but also ordered that no one, including Ursula, be allowed to come within three meters of him.</t2709><t2710>Meanwhile, guards were posted at various points around the house.</t2710><t2711>Colonel Aureliano Buendia was wearing a coarse fabric uniform without insignia or epaulets, and his boots were smeared with mud and dried blood on the spurs.</t2711><t2712>A holster with an open flap was hanging at his waist.</t2712><t2713>His hand, which never left the grip of his pistol, was as alert and tense as his gaze.</t2713><t2714>The head that had now significantly receded at the forehead looked as if it had been baked in a kiln without glaze.</t2714><t2715>His face, scorched by the salt of the Caribbean Sea, had taken on a metallic hardness.</t2715>
<t2716>A kind of vitality connected to his inner coldness had protected him from aging and deteriorating.</t2716> <t2717>He was taller, paler, and bonier than when he had left, and had begun to show the first signs of resisting homesickness.</t2717> <t2718>Ursula thought to herself, -My God, he looks like someone who can do anything now, she said.</t2718> <t2719>Indeed, Aureliano Buendia had reached a point where he could do anything.</t2719> <t2720>The Aztec shawl he brought to Amaranta, the memories he recounted at dinner, the funny stories, were remnants of his former playful self.</t2720> <t2721>After the order to bury the dead in a common grave was carried out, Colonel Aureliano Buendia assigned Colonel Roque Carnicero to establish the court-martial.</t2721>
<t2722>He himself embarked on implementing radical reforms that would change the newly established Conservative regime in a way that would leave no stone unturned.</t2722> <t2723>He told his aides, -We must act faster than the politicians in the party.</t2723> <t2724>When they open their eyes to the facts, they will be faced with accomplished deeds, he said.</t2724> <t2725>At that moment, he decided to examine the land registry records dating back a hundred years and learned about his brother Jose Arcadio's legitimized scandals.</t2725> <t2726>He defaced and erased the land records.</t2726> <t2727>To make one last gesture of courtesy, he took an hour's break from his work and went to Rebeca to explain his decisions to her.</t2727>
<t2728>Once upon a time, this widow, who was buried in solitude and had been the confidante of Aureliano Buendia's secret loves and had saved his life with her stubbornness, seemed like an image from the past in the dimness of her home.</t2728> <t2729>The woman, whose heart had turned to ashes and who wore black clothes that reached down to her ankles, knew almost nothing about the war.</t2729> <t2730>To Colonel Aureliano Buendia, it seemed as if the phosphorus in her bones was visible under her skin, as if the woman was moving within an electrically charged cloud, in an aged atmosphere where the smell of gunpowder could still be sensed.</t2730> <t2731>Colonel Buendia began by advising Rebeca not to mourn endlessly, to air out the house, and not to turn her back on the world just because Jose Arcadio had died.</t2731> <t2732>However, nothing said to Rebeca mattered anymore.</t2732> <t2733>After seeking peace in eating soil, in the scented letters of Pietro Crespi, and in the stormy bed of her husband to no avail, Rebeca had found peace and tranquility in this house where memories had materialized and floated from room to room like people.</t2733> <t2734>Rebeca, sitting in her rocking chair, looked at him as if it was not herself, who appeared like a ghost from the past, but Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t2734>
<t2735>He wasn't even surprised by the news that the lands Jose Arcadio had taken by force would be returned to their rightful owners.</t2735>
<t2736>"As you see fit, Aureliano," she sighed.</t2736> <t2737>"I have always thought you were a traitor, and now it is fully proven."</t2737>
<t2738>The process of correcting land records coincided with the work of the court presided over by General Gerineldo Marquez.</t2738> <t2739>At the end of the trials, all the regular army officers captured by the revolutionaries were sentenced to death.</t2739> <t2740>Finally, Jose Raquel Moncada was tried.</t2740> <t2741>Ursula intervened.</t2741> <t2742>Reproaching Colonel Aureliano Buendia, she said, -During his time, Macondo had the best administration it ever had.</t2742> <t2743>I don't need to tell you how kind-hearted he was, how much he loved us, you know it better than any of us, she said.</t2743> <t2744>Colonel Aureliano Buendia glared at his mother.</t2744>
<t2745>"I cannot take on the duty of dispensing justice," he said.</t2745> <t2746>"If you have something to say, you will say it in court."</t2746>
<t2747>Ursula did not stop at going to court; she also brought all the mothers of the revolutionary officers in Macondo as witnesses.</t2747> <t2748>The elderly women, some of whom were among the town's first founders and had bravely crossed the mountains, each spoke of General Moncada's virtues.</t2748> <t2749>Ursula spoke last.</t2749> <t2750>Her heart-wrenching honor, the weight of her name, and the credibility of her words momentarily swayed the scales of justice.</t2750> <t2751>Ursula said to the panel of judges, "You have taken this terrible game very seriously and are executing it successfully.</t2751> <t2752>Because you are doing your duty," she said.</t2752> <t2753>"Just remember that as long as God grants us life, we will remain mothers, and no matter how great revolutionaries you become, the moment you attempt to show disrespect, it is our right to pull down your pants and give you a good spanking."</t2753> <t2754>As Ursula's words continued to echo in the school turned barracks, the panel of judges adjourned for deliberation.</t2754> <t2755>At midnight, Jose Raquel Moncada was sentenced to death.</t2755> <t2756>Despite all of Ursula's pressing, urging, and resistance, Colonel Aureliano Buendia refused to change the decision.</t2756>
<t2757>Just before dawn, he went to see the convict in the room used as a cell.</t2757>
<t2758>"Don't forget, my friend," he said.</t2758> <t2759>"I'm not the one killing you."</t2759> <t2760>"The revolution is killing you."</t2760>
<t2761>General Moncada; he didn't even get out of bed when he saw him coming.</t2761>
<t2762>"You have a long road to hell, just go away, my friend," he said.</t2762>
<t2763>Colonel Aureliano Buendia had not looked at his friend sincerely until that moment of his arrival.</t2763> <t2764>He was surprised and disgusted with himself when he saw how his friend had deteriorated, how his hands trembled, and how he accepted death with an almost ceremonial formality.</t2764> <t2765>This feeling was mixed with a bit of pity.</t2765>
<t2766>"You know better than I do that all court-martial trials are a ridiculous farce," he said.</t2766> <t2767>"In fact, you are atoning for the crimes committed by others."</t2767> <t2768>"Because this time, we will win the war at any cost."</t2768> <t2769>"If you were in my place, wouldn't you do the same?"</t2769>
<t2770>General Moncada stood up to wipe his thick-rimmed glasses on the hem of his shirt.</t2770> <t2771>It could be, he said.</t2771> <t2772>-What saddens me is not that you are going to kill me, because for people like us, being executed is in a way like dying of natural causes.</t2772> <t2773>He placed his glasses on the bed.</t2773> <t2774>He took off his watch and chain.</t2774> <t2775>-What really saddens me, he continued, -is that after hating the military so much, after fighting them so much, and after thinking so much about them, in the end, you have become worse than them.</t2775> <t2776>And no ideal in the world is worth such degradation.</t2776> <t2777>He took off his wedding ring and the Holy Mary medallion, and placed them next to his glasses and watch.</t2777>
<t2778>Then he finished his words: After reaching this point, not only do you become the most despotic and bloody dictator of our latest history, but you also have my dear friend Ursula shot to silence your conscience.</t2778>
<t2779>Colonel Aureliano Buendia stood motionless.</t2779> <t2780>General Moncada gave him his glasses, medallion, watch, and ring.</t2780> <t2781>Then, changing the tone of his voice, he said, "I didn't call you here to scold you."</t2781> <t2782>"I wanted to ask you to send these to my wife."</t2782>
<t2783>Colonel Aureliano Buendia put what the general gave him into his pockets.</t2783>
<t2784>-Is your wife still in Manaure?</t2784>
<t2785>-She's still in Manaure.</t2785> <t2786>At the address where you sent the letter, in the house behind the church again.</t2786>
<t2787>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, "I will send it willingly, Jose Raquel," he said.</t2787>
<t2788>When Colonel Aureliano Buendia stepped into the blue air of dawn, his face became moist as it had at a dawn in the past, and it was only then that he realized he had ordered the execution to be carried out in the courtyard rather than against the cemetery wall.</t2788> <t2789>The firing squad lined up opposite the door saluted him in a manner befitting heads of state.</t2789>
<t2790>Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, "They can bring him out now."</t2790>
<t2791>The first to grasp the futility of the war was Colonel Gerineldo Marquez.</t2791> <t2792>By virtue of being in charge of the civil and military administration of Macondo, he communicated with Colonel Aureliano</t2792> <t2793>Buendia twice a week via telegraph.</t2793> <t2794>Initially, these communications served to determine the course of a life-and-death struggle, to report where the war was being fought at any given moment and in which direction it was progressing.</t2794> <t2795>Although Aureliano Buendia never opened up to even his closest friends and kept his distance, he still imbued his words with a friendly meaning that identified him as the one at the other end of the wire at that time.</t2795> <t2796>He often prolonged the conversation more than necessary and maintained it in the atmosphere of a family chat.</t2796> <t2797>However, as the war intensified and spread, Colonel Aureliano Buendia's presence at the other end of the wire began to shift increasingly into an unreal realm.</t2797> <t2798>The distinctive qualities of his speech became blurred, gradually turning into forms of words that had completely lost their meanings.</t2798> <t2799>At that point, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez began to be content with just listening, and as he listened, he felt the discomfort of talking to a stranger from another world.</t2799>
<t2800>Listening, listening, then clicking the manipulator, -I understand, Aureliano.</t2800> <t2801>Long live the Liberal Party! he concluded.</t2801>
<t2802>In the end, he lost all connection to the war.</t2802> <t2803>Once a real action, an irresistible passion of his youth, the war became a distant memory, a void for him.</t2803> <t2804>To escape this meaninglessness, he often sought refuge in Amaranta's sewing room.</t2804>
<t2805>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez went to Amaranta every day.</t2805> <t2806>Gerineldo enjoyed watching Amaranta slide the fabric for her puffy, foam-like petticoat under the foot of the sewing machine operated by Beautiful Remedios, and her hands turning and twisting the fabric.</t2806> <t2807>They would sit for hours without speaking, content just to be in each other's presence.</t2807> <t2808>However, while Amaranta secretly took pleasure in keeping Gerineldo's love aflame, Gerineldo was unaware of the hidden games in her inscrutable heart.</t2808> <t2809>When Amaranta heard that Gerineldo had returned, she was breathless with excitement.</t2809> <t2810>Yet, the moment he entered the house amidst the noisy crowd around Colonel Aureliano Buendia, and she saw how the period of exile had worn him down, aged and weakened him, made him smell foul with dirt and grime, and how his suspended left arm made him look even more unattractive, Amaranta was so disappointed that she nearly fainted.</t2810>
<t2811>"Oh my God, the man I've been waiting for all this time wasn't him," she thought.</t2811> <t2812>But the next day, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez came home washed and shaved, with lavender water on his mustache, and that bloody bandage removed from his arm.</t2812> <t2813>He also brought Amaranta a prayer book with mother-of-pearl inlay.</t2813>
<t2814>Amaranta said, "These men are so strange."</t2814> <t2815>She couldn't find anything else to say.</t2815> <t2816>They fight against priests and give their lives, and then they bring a prayer book as a gift.</t2816>
<t2817>Gerineldo, from that day on, came to check on Amaranta every day, even during the most intense times of the war.</t2817> <t2818>When Beautiful Remedios was not around, Gerineldo would turn the machine's handle.</t2818> <t2819>Despite being granted such extraordinary privileges, the dedication, patience, and resilience of this man, who never forgot to leave his weapons in the living room to enter the sewing room unarmed, astonished Amaranta.</t2819> <t2820>For four years, Gerineldo tirelessly repeated that he loved her, and Amaranta always found a way to gently turn him down without hurting him.</t2820> <t2821>She did not want to hurt him, because even though she could not manage to love Gerineldo, she had become unable to do without him.</t2821> <t2822>Even Beautiful Remedios, who seemed indifferent to everything and was thought to be mentally slow, could not remain indifferent in the face of such devotion and took the side of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez.</t2822> <t2823>Amaranta suddenly realized that this girl, whom she had raised with her own hands and who had just entered her teenage years, was the most beautiful creature that had ever existed in Macondo.</t2823>
<t2824>He sensed that the jealousy and anger he once felt towards Rebeca were rekindling in his heart, and to prevent this feeling from escalating to the extreme of wishing for the girl's death, he prayed to God and forbade Beautiful Remedios from entering the sewing room.</t2824> <t2825>At that time, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had begun to feel the meaninglessness and tedium of the war.</t2825> <t2826>Ready to sacrifice the glory and honor that had cost him the best years of his youth for Amaranta's sake, he unleashed the love he had suppressed for years like a flood and tried with all his might to win over Amaranta.</t2826> <t2827>He failed.</t2827> <t2828>One August day, Amaranta gave her patient suitor her final and definitive answer, -Let's forget about each other.</t2828> <t2829>Such things are beyond us now, she said, and after giving her final and definitive answer, she shut herself in her room to be crushed under the unbearable weight of her own stubbornness and to weep for the loneliness that would last until her death.</t2829>
<t2830>That day Colonel Aureliano Buendia contacted Colonel Gerineldo Marquez by telegraph.</t2830> <t2831>It was one of those daily conversations that wouldn't affect the ongoing war.</t2831> <t2832>At the end of the conversation, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez looked at the deserted streets, the crystallized roofs of the almond tree, and saw himself lost in loneliness.</t2832>
<t2833>Pressing the manipulator, -Aureliano said.</t2833> <t2834>-It's raining in Macondo.</t2834>
<t2835>There was no response for a long time.</t2835> <t2836>Then the ruthless words of Colonel Aureliano Buendia began to shake the machine.</t2836>
<t2837>"Don't be foolish, Gerineldo," said the walrus, "What could be more natural than rain in August!"</t2837>
<t2838>It had been so long since they had seen each other that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez was surprised by the severity of Aureliano's reaction.</t2838> <t2839>When Colonel Aureliano Buendia returned to Macondo two months later, Gerineldo's surprise turned into bewilderment.</t2839> <t2840>The change in Aureliano even astonished Ursula.</t2840> <t2841>He came quietly, without any mockery or ceremony.</t2841> <t2842>Despite the heat, he was tightly wrapped in his cloak.</t2842> <t2843>He had three mistresses with him.</t2843> <t2844>He placed all three women in the same house, and he himself rarely left the hammock.</t2844> <t2845>He wasn't even properly reading the telegrams reporting the daily operations.</t2845> <t2846>One day, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez requested orders about whether to withdraw from a border region, which could lead to the conflict taking on an international dimension.</t2846>
<t2847>Colonel Aureliano Buendia commanded, "Do not bother me with trivial matters."</t2847> <t2848>"Ask God what you should do."</t2848>
<t2849>This was perhaps the most critical moment of the war.</t2849> <t2850>The Liberal landowners, who had initially supported the revolution, had made secret agreements with the Conservative landowners to prevent the re-examination of land registry records.</t2850> <t2851>The exiled politicians who provided financial aid to the fighters announced to the public that all of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's powers had been taken away.</t2851> <t2852>But the colonel didn't care about authority at all.</t2852> <t2853>He never even picked up his poems, which filled five large notebooks and had been forgotten at the bottom of a chest.</t2853> <t2854>At night or when he took a nap, he would call one of the women to his hammock, and after reaching a superficial, primal satisfaction with her, he would collapse like a log and sleep.</t2854> <t2855>He was like a stone that neither sorrow nor worry ever touched.</t2855> <t2856>Only in those days did he know that he was doomed to struggle to the end with his heart turned into a tangled mess.</t2856> <t2857>Initially, he had been dizzy with the glorious air of his return and the considerable victories he had won, coming right to the edge of the abyss of greatness.</t2857> <t2858>With his animal hide clothing and tiger claw ornaments, the Duke of Marlborough, a great master of the art of war who terrified the young and was feared by the old, was Aureliano's right-hand man.</t2858> <t2859>He enjoyed having him constantly by his side.</t2859>
<t2860>At that time, Ursula decided that no human being, including herself, should come closer than three meters to him.</t2860> <t2861>Wherever he stood, those around him would immediately run and draw a circle with chalk, and Colonel Aureliano Buendia would step into the center of this circle, which no one else could enter, and issue commands that led nowhere regarding the fate of the world.</t2861> <t2862>After the execution of General Moncada, during his first visit to Manaure, Aureliano had rushed to the general's house to fulfill his will.</t2862> <t2863>The general's widow took his glasses, medal, watch, and ring, but did not let Aureliano step inside the threshold.</t2863>
<t2864>"You cannot enter, Colonel," he said.</t2864> <t2865>"Maybe you command in the war, but in my house, my word is law."</t2865>
<t2866>Colonel Aureliano Buendia never showed his anger, but his rage only subsided after the guards looted the house and turned it into a heap of ashes.</t2866> <t2867>Colonel Marquez said, "Watch your heart, Aureliano, you're decaying before you die."</t2867> <t2868>In those days, Colonel Aureliano Buendia called a second meeting of the leading rebel commanders.</t2868> <t2869>All kinds of people attended this meeting: idealists, those blinded by ambition, thrill-seekers, social misfits, even common criminals.</t2869> <t2870>Among them was even a former Conservative official who had taken refuge in rebellion to escape trial for embezzlement.</t2870> <t2871>Most of them didn't even know why they were fighting.</t2871> <t2872>In this colorful group, driven to the brink of internal explosion due to differences in values, one authority stood out: General Teofilo Vargas.</t2872>
<t2873>General, an illiterate, uncultured, and unrefined man who blindly convinced his followers, deceiving them into believing that God had given him duties, was a pure-blooded Indian.</t2873> <t2874>Colonel Aureliano Buendia had gathered the rebel commanders to unite against the maneuvers of the politicians.</t2874> <t2875>General Teofilo Vargas revealed his own intentions and within a few hours, dismantled the coalition of qualified commanders and took command.</t2875>
<t2876>Colonel Aureliano Buendia said to his officers, "This is a wild animal we must never take our eyes off."</t2876> <t2877>"This man is more dangerous to us than the Minister of Defense."</t2877> <t2878>Upon hearing this, a young captain, known for his timidity, nervously raised his finger.</t2878>
<t2879>"It's simple, Colonel," he said.</t2879> <t2880>"Let's kill this man."</t2880>
<t2881>Colonel Aureliano Buendia was not surprised by the coldness of the proposal, but he was annoyed that it had been made just a second before he could make it himself.</t2881>
<t2882>"Don't expect me to give such an order," he said.</t2882>
<t2883>To be honest, he didn't give such an order.</t2883> <t2884>However, two weeks later, General Teofilo Vargas, who had fallen into an ambush, was torn to pieces with machetes, and Colonel Aureliano Buendia assumed the position of commander-in-chief.</t2884> <t2885>The night when all the rebel commanders recognized him as the commander-in-chief, Colonel Aureliano Buendia woke up in fear and asked for a blanket.</t2885> <t2886>The coldness that enveloped him made his bones shiver, freezing him to the core even under the scorching sun.</t2886> <t2887>Because of this chill, he couldn't sleep for several months; then the chill became a habit.</t2887> <t2888>The intoxication of power began to dissipate with waves of unease.</t2888>
<t2889>Aureliano had a young officer who suggested the killing of General Teofilo Vargas executed, thinking it might help with his chill.</t2889> <t2890>Aureliano's orders were carried out before they even left his mouth, even before he himself had thought them through, and were taken to extremes he wouldn't dare to reach.</t2890> <t2891>Colonel Aureliano Buendia sank into the solitude of unapproachable power and began to lose awareness of his actions.</t2891> <t2892>He was disturbed by the enthusiastic receptions in neighboring villages, suspecting that the villagers were showing the same enthusiasm to the enemy side.</t2892> <t2893>Wherever he went, he encountered a multitude of young men who looked at him with his own eyes, spoke with his own voice, shared the distrust he felt towards them, and claimed to be his sons.</t2893>
<t2894>Aureliano found himself scattered and multiplied, sinking into utter loneliness.</t2894> <t2895>He began to believe that even his own officers were lying to him.</t2895> <t2896>He clashed with the Duke of Marlborough.</t2896> <t2897>He used to say that a man's best friend is a dead friend.</t2897> <t2898>He was exhausted and worn out by the endless, futile cycle of war that always caught him in the same place, but each time a little older, a little more tired, and a little less aware of the reasons, the causes, or even the timing of events.</t2898> <t2899>There was always someone outside the chalk circle.</t2899> <t2900>It was someone without money, someone whose son had caught whooping cough, or someone who just couldn't stand eating the shit of war anymore and wanted to leave and sleep forever.</t2900>
<t2901>Moreover, they would stand at attention in front of him as if nothing had happened, saying, "Everything is normal, Colonel."</t2901> <t2902>The most terrifying aspect of that endless war was precisely this normalcy; nothing was happening.</t2902> <t2903>Aureliano, a man who had been abandoned by his premonitions and was trying to escape a chill that would never leave him until his death, sought his last resort in Macondo, in the warmth of old memories.</t2903> <t2904>He had become so indifferent that even when he heard that the authorized commission members had arrived for negotiations to stop the war, he merely turned over in his hammock without fully waking up.</t2904>
<t2905>-Take them to the whores, he said.</t2905>
<t2906>The commission members were six lawyers in tailcoats and top hats, enduring the scorching November sun with great indifference and seriousness.</t2906> <t2907>Ursula hosted them in her own home.</t2907> <t2908>Almost all day, they sat in the bedroom and talked secretly; in the late afternoon, they took a woman each and a few accordion players with them and closed down Catarino's shop.</t2908>
<t2909>Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, "Don't interfere with their pleasures."</t2909>
<t2910>-You see, I am the one who knows what they want again.</t2910>
<t2911>In early December, the long-awaited meeting, which many thought would lead to intractable debates, concluded in less than an hour.</t2911>
<t2912>Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not sit inside the chalk circle drawn by his aides, next to the ghost of the lantern covered with white sheets, in the oven-like heated room.</t2912> <t2913>Wrapping himself in his wool blanket, he sat on the chair among his political advisors and listened to the proposals of the envoys.</t2913> <t2914>First, they wanted him to stop tampering with the land registry records to regain the support of the Liberal landowners.</t2914> <t2915>Then, to secure the support of the Catholic masses, they wanted him to stop meddling with the influence of the clergy.</t2915> <t2916>Finally, to preserve family integrity, they wanted him to abandon the aim of granting equal rights to children born out of wedlock.</t2916>
<t2917>When the requests were read and finished, Colonel Aureliano Buendia smiled.</t2917> <t2918>"So, he said, "we are fighting only for power."</t2918>
<t2919>One of the delegates interjected, -These changes are for tactical reasons.</t2919> <t2920>-The important thing right now is to broaden the base of the war that relies on the people.</t2920> <t2921>Then, we will revisit these matters.</t2921>
<t2922>One of Colonel Aureliano Buendía's political advisors couldn't stand it and interrupted the man.</t2922>
<t2923>"There is a contradiction here," he said.</t2923> <t2924>"If these changes are beneficial and appropriate, then the Conservative regime must also be good."</t2924> <t2925>"As you said, if we are going to expand the grassroots base of the war with these changes, it means that the Conservative regime is based on a broad popular foundation."</t2925> <t2926>"In short, it means that we have been fighting against the feelings of the people for nearly twenty years."</t2926>
<t2927>He was about to continue speaking, but Colonel Aureliano</t2927> <t2928>Buendia silenced him with a gesture.</t2928> <t2929>-Don't waste your time, doctor.</t2929>
<t2930>"What matters is that from now on, we will fight to seize power," he said with a smile, took the documents extended by the delegates, and prepared to sign them.</t2930> <t2931>"Since that's the case, we see no harm in accepting it," he concluded.</t2931>
<t2932>The men looked at each other in astonishment.</t2932> <t2933>Colonel Aureliano Buendia held the ink pen in the air and unleashed the full weight of his authority on Colonel Gerinaldo Marquez.</t2933>
<t2934>"Surrender your weapons," he commanded.</t2934>
<t2935>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez stood up and placed his weapons on the table.</t2935>
<t2936>Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, "Go to the barracks and stand before the revolutionary court."</t2936>
<t2937>Then, he signed the agreement and handed the papers to the envoys.</t2937> <t2938>"Here are your papers, gentlemen," he said.</t2938> <t2939>"I hope you can achieve something with these."</t2939>
<t2940>Two days later, Colonel Gerinaldo Marquez, who was being tried for treason, was sentenced to death.</t2940> <t2941>Colonel Aureliano Buendia was lying in his hammock, completely ignoring the pleas for Gerinaldo's pardon.</t2941> <t2942>On the night the sentence was to be carried out, Ursula, defying Aureliano's orders not to be disturbed, went to speak with him in his bedroom.</t2942> <t2943>Dressed in black from head to toe and looking unusually sorrowful as always, Ursula stood throughout the three-minute conversation with her son.</t2943> <t2944>Calmly, she said, "I know you are going to have Gerineldo shot."</t2944> <t2945>"I also know that there is nothing I can do to prevent it."</t2945> <t2946>"Still, I came to warn you: The moment I see Gerineldo's dead body, I swear on the bones of my dead father, on the bones of my dead mother, I swear on the memory of Jose Arcadio Buendia, I swear before God, that no matter what hole you crawl into, I will find you and kill you with my own hands."</t2946> <t2947>Without waiting for a response from Aureliano, Ursula turned and, before leaving through the door, concluded her words by saying, "Whether you have become like this or were born with a pig's tail, it's all the same."</t2947>
<t2948>Throughout that unending night, on one side, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez thought about the dead days spent in Amaranta's sewing room; on the other side, Colonel Aureliano Buendia struggled for hours to break through the hard shell of his loneliness.</t2948> <t2949>After that distant day when his father took him to see ice, his only happy moments were the times spent in his silver workshop making tiny fish.</t2949> <t2950>It had taken him thirty-two wars, breaking all his pacts with death, wallowing in the filth called fame like a pig, and losing exactly forty years to understand the superiority and privilege of simplicity.</t2950>
<t2951>At dawn, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, weary from a sleepless night spent in self-torment, entered the cell an hour before the execution.</t2951> <t2952>He said to Colonel Gerinaldo Marquez, The comedy is over, friend.</t2952> <t2953>-Let's get out of here before the mosquitoes carry out the death sentence.</t2953> <t2954>Colonel Gerinaldo Marquez couldn't hide his disgust at this attitude.</t2954>
<t2955>-No, Aureliano, she replied.</t2955> <t2956>-I would rather die than see you become a bloody despot.</t2956>
<t2957>Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, "You won't see such a thing."</t2957> <t2958>"Now put on your shoes and help me end this damn war."</t2958>
<t2959>When Colonel Aureliano Buendia said these words, he did not know that starting a war was easier than ending one.</t2959> <t2960>He had to exert a full year of terrible and bloody effort to force the government to propose peace terms that the rebels would accept.</t2960> <t2961>He also had to spend another year convincing his own partisans that these terms were acceptable.</t2961> <t2962>He had to resort to unimaginable brutalities to suppress the uprising of his own officers who were unwilling to make peace and were pursuing absolute victory, and in the end, he hoped for help from enemy forces to make them give up.</t2962>
<t2963>He had never attained the stature of a great soldier as he did in those days.</t2963> <t2964>Knowing that he was fighting for his own salvation, rather than for abstract ideals or slogans that politicians would twist to their advantage, filled him with a fiery enthusiasm.</t2964> <t2965>Once having fought tirelessly for victory, now Colonel Gerineldo Marquez fought with faith and dedication for defeat, and he scolded Aureliano for recklessly endangering his life and not being cautious.</t2965> <t2966>Smiling, Aureliano said, "Don't worry."</t2966> <t2967>"Dying is much harder than it seems."</t2967> <t2968>For him, this was true.</t2968> <t2969>The belief that his death was predetermined gave him a mysterious immunity, a temporary immortality, allowing Aureliano to charge fearlessly into the most dangerous moments of battle.</t2969> <t2970>For this reason, he was able to achieve defeat, which was much harder, much bloodier, and much more costly than victory.</t2970>
<t2971>During the war that lasted almost twenty years, Colonel Aureliano Buendía had returned home many times.</t2971> <t2972>However, each time he came hurriedly, in between two important tasks, and his soldiers never left his side, creating an aura of legend around Aureliano that even Úrsula noticed.</t2972> <t2973>All of this eventually turned Aureliano into a stranger.</t2973> <t2974>When he opened a house for his three mistresses on his last visit to Macondo, he went to his own home only two or three times, just to call for meals.</t2974> <t2975>Beautiful Remedios and the twins, who were born during the war, knew him only from a distance.</t2975> <t2976>Amaranta, on the other hand, could not reconcile the memory of her brother, who had spent his youth making little goldfish, with this legendary warrior who kept a three-meter distance between himself and all of humanity.</t2976> <t2977>When the news of the ceasefire agreement spread, the household thought that Aureliano would finally be returned to his family, that he would come back to them as a human being once more, and they felt the family bonds that had been in the shadows for so long stronger than ever.</t2977>
<t2978>Ursula said, "Finally, there will be a man in our house again."</t2978>
<t2979>Amaranta was the first to sense that they had completely lost Aureliano.</t2979> <t2980>A week before the ceasefire agreement, Aureliano entered the house with two barefoot soldiers, without his officers and aides.</t2980> <t2981>The soldiers left the mule saddle and the chest containing the poems, which were all that remained of Aureliano's once-overflowing baggage, on the veranda.</t2981> <t2982>Amaranta called out to him as he passed in front of the sewing room.</t2982> <t2983>Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not recognize her.</t2983>
<t2984>Amaranta, in her joy at Aureliano's return home, said, "I am Amaranta," showing her hand wrapped in a black bandage.</t2984> <t2985>"Look."</t2985> <t2986>Colonel Aureliano Buendia smiled the same way he did that morning when he first saw the bandage on his sister's hand, having come to Macondo once condemned to death.</t2986>
<t2987>"How time flies," he said.</t2987> <t2988>"This is a terrible thing!"</t2988>
<t2989>The soldiers of the state had to protect the house.</t2989> <t2990>The people on the street were cursing and spitting at Aureliano, accusing him of needlessly igniting the war just to sell it at a better price in the end.</t2990> <t2991>Aureliano was shivering from both the heat and the cold.</t2991> <t2992>Wounds had opened up again under his armpits.</t2992> <t2993>Six months ago, when Ursula first heard the rumors of a ceasefire, she had opened the bridal room, cleaned it thoroughly, burned fragrant myrrh incense in every corner, and started waiting for her son to return home to slowly grow old among Remedios' now moldy dolls.</t2993>
<t2994>However, Aureliano had completed all his duties towards life, including aging, in the last two years.</t2994> <t2995>As he passed by the silver workshop that Ursula had meticulously prepared, Aureliano didn't even notice that the keys were in the lock.</t2995> <t2996>He didn't realize how time had gnawed at the house, made it decrepit, and brought about a situation that could be described as disastrous after so many years for someone who hadn't erased his memories from his mind.</t2996> <t2997>Neither the peeling plaster on the walls, nor the dirty, cotton-like cobwebs in the corners, nor the dust on the begonias, nor the worm-eaten beams, nor the rust covering the hinges caused Aureliano any pain; he didn't fall into any of the traps set by his longing for the house.</t2997> <t2998>He wrapped himself in his blanket, sat on the veranda, and watched the rain fall on the begonias all day.</t2998>
<t2999>As if he had come there only to wait for the rain to stop, he hadn't even taken off his boots.</t2999> <t3000>Ursula sensed that he wouldn't stay with them for long.</t3000> <t3001>-If he's not going to war anymore, then it means he will surely die, she thought.</t3001> <t3002>This assumption was so certain, so convincing that Ursula interpreted it as a prophecy.</t3002>
<t3003>That evening at dinner, Aureliano Segundo was tearing his bread with his right hand and eating his soup with his left hand.</t3003> <t3004>His twin brother Jose Arcadio Segundo, on the other hand, was tearing his bread with his left hand and eating his soup with his right hand.</t3004> <t3005>Their actions were so harmoniously synchronized that they looked more like someone playing in front of a mirror than two brothers sitting across from each other.</t3005> <t3006>This game, which they discovered when they realized they were identical twins, was repeated at dinner in honor of Aureliano's arrival.</t3006> <t3007>But Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not even notice.</t3007> <t3008>He was so detached and so disconnected from everything that he did not even see Beautiful Remedios passing by him naked as he went to the bedroom.</t3008> <t3009>Only Ursula dared to break his reverie.</t3009>
<t3010>Halfway through the meal, -If you have to leave again, at least try not to forget our situation tonight, he said.</t3010>
<t3011>Then Colonel Aureliano Buendia realized that the only person who could pierce through his pain and loneliness was Ursula.</t3011> <t3012>He wasn't surprised by this; for the first time in years, he looked at his mother's face.</t3012> <t3013>Ursula's skin had become like leather, her teeth had decayed, and her hair had lost its color.</t3013> <t3014>She had a frightening appearance.</t3014> <t3015>Aureliano compared his mother's appearance to his oldest memory of her, from the day she predicted that the boiling soup bowl would fall off the table, and found his mother shattered.</t3015> <t3016>He saw in an instant the traces, ulcers, wounds, and cracks that daily troubles over more than half a century had left on his mother, and realized that these did not evoke any feeling of pity in him.</t3016> <t3017>Then he made one last effort to find the place in his heart where emotions had rotted away, but he couldn't find it.</t3017>
<t3018>On another visit, when he sensed Ursula's scent on his own skin, he felt a feeling akin to shame, at the very least.</t3018> <t3019>Later, he noticed many times that Ursula's thoughts were mingling with his own.</t3019> <t3020>But the war had swept away all these feelings.</t3020> <t3021>Now even his wife Remedios was nothing more than a faint memory of someone who could be his daughter.</t3021> <t3022>The countless women he had known in the desert of love, and who had spread his seed throughout the coastal region, had left no trace in Aureliano's heart.</t3022> <t3023>Most of them had entered his room in the dark and left before dawn, leaving behind nothing but the fatigue in his body the next day.</t3023> <t3024>The only feeling that had endured without succumbing to time and war was the bond he had felt for his brother Jose Arcadio during their childhood.</t3024> <t3025>This, too, was a feeling based not on love, but on complicity.</t3025>
<t3026>Aureliano dismissed Ursula's request not to forget them by saying, "Forgive me, the war erased everything."</t3026> <t3027>In the days following that event, Aureliano busied himself with erasing all traces of his passage through the world.</t3027> <t3028>He distributed everything in the silver workshop until there was nothing left that was uniquely his.</t3028> <t3029>He gave his clothes to the soldiers.</t3029> <t3030>Feeling a guilt akin to what his father felt when he buried the spear that killed Prudencio Aguilar, he buried all his weapons in the yard.</t3030> <t3031>He kept only a pistol with a single bullet in it.</t3031> <t3032>Ursula did not interfere at all.</t3032> <t3033>Only when he attempted to destroy the picture of Remedios, illuminated by a lamp that burned day and night in the living room, did Ursula stop him.</t3033> <t3034>"This picture ceased to be yours long ago," she said.</t3034> <t3035>"It is now a family heirloom."</t3035> <t3036>On the night the armistice agreement came into effect, when there was nothing left in the house to remind anyone of him, Aureliano took the chest where the poems were kept and carried it to the kitchen, where Santa Sofia de la Piedad was preparing to light the oven.</t3036>
<t3037>Handing over a bundle of yellowed papers, he said, "Burn the oven with these."</t3037> <t3038>"They will burn better because they are very old."</t3038>
<t3039>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, that silent woman, that gentle, that woman who never conflicted with anyone, not even her own children, sensed that this was something that should not be done.</t3039>
<t3040>"These are important papers," he said.</t3040>
<t3041>The Colonel replied, "Not at all."</t3041> <t3042>"These are things a person scribbles to themselves."</t3042>
<t3043>-Then, come closer yourself, my colonel.</t3043>
<t3044>Aureliano not only threw the papers into the furnace with his own hands, but he also broke the chest into pieces with a cane axe and threw it into the fire.</t3044> <t3045>Hours earlier, Pilar Ternera had come to see him.</t3045> <t3046>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, after not seeing her for so many years, was surprised to see how the woman had aged, gained weight, and how her smile had lost its beauty, while at the same time he was astonished at how skillfully she had learned the language of the papers.</t3046> <t3047>Pilar had said to him, "Watch your mouth."</t3047> <t3048>Aureliano was pondering whether these words, once again spoken during his brightest days, had determined his fate to an astonishing degree.</t3048> <t3049>A short time later, while his private doctor was dressing his wounds, Aureliano, without seeming too interested, asked where exactly his heart was.</t3049> <t3050>The doctor listened with a stethoscope, then drew a circle on Aureliano's chest with a cotton swab dipped in tincture of iodine.</t3050>
<t3051>On the Tuesday morning when the weapons were laid down, a hot and rainy day dawned.</t3051> <t3052>Colonel Aureliano Buendia entered the kitchen before five o'clock and drank his usual plain coffee.</t3052> <t3053>Ursula said, "You were born on a day like this."</t3053> <t3054>"Everyone was astonished when you were born with your eyes open."</t3054> <t3055>Aureliano paid no attention to her stories because he was listening to the bugle sounds tearing through the dawn silence, the soldiers lining up, and the commands being given.</t3055> <t3056>After so many years of fighting, these sounds should not have felt unfamiliar, yet Aureliano felt the same weakness in his knees and the shiver in his skin that he had felt when he saw his first naked woman in his youth.</t3056> <t3057>He felt a strange longing, thinking that if he had married that woman, he would have been a happy, unknown artisan, unaware of war, fame, and glory.</t3057> <t3058>This unexpected shiver ruined his breakfast.</t3058> <t3059>At seven in the morning, when Colonel Gerineldo Marquez came to take him with a group of rebel officers, he found Aureliano more lonely, more withdrawn, and more pensive than ever.</t3059> <t3060>Ursula tried to throw a new cloak over Aureliano's shoulders.</t3060> <t3061>"What will the government say then?"</t3061> <t3062>"They'll think you surrendered because you didn't even have enough money to buy a cloak," she said.</t3062> <t3063>But Aureliano refused.</t3063> <t3064>As he was about to leave through the door, he put on Jose Arcadio Buendia's old felt hat at Ursula's insistence.</t3064>
<t3065>Ursula, said Aureliano.</t3065> <t3066>If you find yourself in trouble, in a difficult situation, promise me that in the last moment, you will think of your mother.</t3066>
<t3067>Aureliano raised his hand with fingers spread and smiled absentmindedly.</t3067> <t3068>Then, without saying a word, he left the house and plunged into the midst of curses, insults, and imprecations that pursued him until he was out of town.</t3068> <t3069>Ursula bolted the door with an iron bar, determined never to open it again until she died.</t3069> <t3070>"We will rot here," she thought.</t3070> <t3071>"We will turn to ashes in this manless house, but we will not give this vile town the pleasure of seeing us cry."</t3071>
<t3072>Ursula searched the house thoroughly all morning, looking in the most unlikely places, hoping to find a memento of her son.</t3072> <t3073>She found nothing.</t3073> <t3074>The signing ceremony took place twenty kilometers from Macondo, in the shade of a large tree around which the town of Neerlandia would later be established.</t3074> <t3075>Young seminarians, dressed in white and resembling a flock of doves startled by the rain, served the rebels who had laid down their arms, as well as the representatives of the government and the party.</t3075> <t3076>Colonel Aureliano Buendia arrived on a mule mired in mud.</t3076> <t3077>He had not shaved.</t3077> <t3078>He felt more pain from his wounds than from the shattering of his dreams.</t3078> <t3079>For he had reached the end of all hopes and had left behind his longing for fame and glory.</t3079> <t3080>In accordance with Aureliano's wishes, there were no bands playing, no bells ringing, no fireworks, no shouts of victory, nor any other displays that might alter the mournful nature of the truce.</t3080>
<t3081>The glass negatives of the photographer who managed to take the only remaining picture of Aureliano were shattered before the picture could be printed.</t3081> <t3082>The ceremony lasted only as long as it took to sign the documents.</t3082> <t3083>Around the wooden table in the middle of a patched-up fair tent sat the last officers loyal to Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t3083> <t3084>Before the signatures were affixed, the President's special envoy wanted to read the surrender document aloud.</t3084>
<t3085>Colonel Aureliano Buendia objected to this.</t3085> <t3086>"Let's not waste time with formalities," he said, and prepared to sign the papers without reading them.</t3086> <t3087>Then one of his officers broke the lethargic silence in the tent.</t3087>
<t3088>-Colonel, please, for our sake, don't be the first to sign, he said.</t3088>
<t3089>Colonel Aureliano Buendia accepted this request.</t3089> <t3090>When the papers circled around the table in an absolute silence where the scratching of the pen on the paper was clear enough to distinguish the letters of the writings one by one, the signature space in the first row was empty.</t3090> <t3091>Colonel Aureliano Buendia prepared to fill that empty space.</t3091>
<t3092>Another of his officers interjected, "Colonel, there is still time for everything to be fixed," he said.</t3092>
<t3093>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, without changing the expression on his face, signed the first copy.</t3093> <t3094>As he was signing the last copy, a rebel colonel appeared at the door, pulling a mule loaded with two crates.</t3094> <t3095>Despite being very young, he had a dry, dull appearance and a patient demeanor.</t3095> <t3096>He was the treasurer of the revolutionary organization in the Macondo region.</t3096>
<t3097>For six days, he had trudged along the road with great difficulty, dragging a nearly dying mule to arrive just in time for the signing ceremony of the ceasefire.</t3097> <t3098>Reluctantly, with a heavy heart, he unloaded the crates, opened them, and laid out seventy-two gold bars one by one on the table.</t3098> <t3099>The existence of this fortune had slipped everyone's mind.</t3099> <t3100>In the chaos of the last year, when the command center had collapsed and the revolution had degenerated into a bloody power struggle among the leaders, it had become impossible to determine any responsibility.</t3100> <t3101>No one had paid attention to the revolutionary gold, which had been melted down, molded, and then covered with baked clay to look like bricks.</t3101> <t3102>Colonel Aureliano Buendia wrote down the seventy-two gold bars in the list of transferred items on the surrender document and ended the ceremony without giving anyone a chance to make a speech.</t3102> <t3103>The young man, dirty and grimy, stood before him, looking at him with his own dull, honey-colored eyes.</t3103>
<t3104>Colonel Aureliano Buendia asked, "Is there something else?"</t3104>
<t3105>The young colonel replied, pursing his lips.</t3105> <t3106>-Receipt.</t3106>
<t3107>Colonel Aureliano Buendia wrote and handed over the receipt himself.</t3107> <t3108>Then he took a glass of lemonade and a biscuit offered by the young priests and retreated to the field tent prepared for him in case he wanted to rest.</t3108> <t3109>Upon entering the tent, he took off his shirt, sat on the edge of the cot, and at precisely a quarter past three in the afternoon, he took his pistol and shot himself in the chest, right in the middle of the circle drawn by his personal doctor with iodine.</t3109> <t3110>At that moment in Macondo, Ursula, wondering why the milk on the stove was taking so long to boil, lifted the lid of the pot and saw that it was bubbling with worms.</t3110>
<t3111>-They killed Aureliano! he shouted.</t3111>
<t3112>Out of a habit born from loneliness, she looked towards the garden and saw Jose Arcadio Buendia, drenched from the rain, looking sorrowful and much older than when he had died.</t3112> <t3113>This time, Ursula said more definitively, "They shot him from behind and no one bothered to close his eyes."</t3113> <t3114>As the sun was setting, Ursula, through her tears, saw bright circles swiftly passing through the sky like smoke and interpreted this as a harbinger of death.</t3114> <t3115>When they brought Colonel Aureliano Buendia, wrapped in a blanket stiffened with dried blood and with eyes bulging with rage, Ursula was still under the chestnut tree, sobbing as she clung to her husband's knees.</t3115>
<t3116>Aureliano Buendia had escaped the danger.</t3116> <t3117>The bullet had followed such a precise path that the doctor, after soaking a cloth in tincture of iodine, inserted it into Aureliano's chest and easily pulled it out from his back.</t3117> <t3118>Then, with a self-satisfied air, he said, "This was my masterpiece."</t3118> <t3119>"That was the only place where the bullet could pass without damaging any vital organs."</t3119> <t3120>Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw that he was surrounded by young priests murmuring desperate prayers for the salvation of his soul.</t3120> <t3121>It was then that he regretted not having shot the bullet into the roof of his mouth, as he had thought of doing, just to mock Pilar Ternera's prophecy.</t3121>
<t3122>He turned to the doctor, "If I still had the authority, I would have you shot immediately," he said.</t3122> <t3123>"Not for saving my life, but for making a fool of me and making me look ridiculous."</t3123>
<t3124>His inability to die restored his lost dignity within a few hours.</t3124> <t3125>Those who gossiped that he sold the war for a room with walls built of golden bricks interpreted his suicide attempt as a display of virtue and sanctified him as a martyr.</t3125> <t3126>Later, when Aureliano refused the Medal of Merit given by the President, even his arch-enemies crowded into his room, asking him to disregard the ceasefire agreement and start a new war.</t3126> <t3127>The house overflowed with gifts from those who wanted to seek forgiveness, wishing him a speedy recovery.</t3127> <t3128>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, influenced by the intense support of his former comrades, did not reject their desires regarding the war.</t3128> <t3129>On the contrary, he became so enthusiastic at the thought of a new war for a moment that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez thought he was waiting for the slightest excuse to declare war.</t3129> <t3130>This excuse was not long in coming.</t3130>
<t3131>The President said that no pensions would be granted to any of the former warriors, whether Liberal or Conservative, until everyone's situation had been examined by a special commission and approved by the parliament.</t3131> <t3132>Colonel Aureliano Buendia roared, "This is an outrage!"</t3132> <t3133>"They will grow old and die waiting for news from the mail," he said.</t3133> <t3134>For the first time, he got up from the rocking chair that Ursula had bought for him to sit and rest until he recovered, and pacing up and down the bedroom, he dictated a harsh message to the president.</t3134> <t3135>In this telegram, which was never made public, he condemned the violation of the Neerlandia Agreement and threatened to fight until death if the pensions were not resolved within two weeks.</t3135> <t3136>He was so justified that he hoped even the former Conservative warriors would support him.</t3136> <t3137>However, the only response from the government was to increase the number of soldiers stationed at the door, supposedly to protect Aureliano, and to prohibit entry to the house for any reason.</t3137> <t3138>The same method was applied to other leaders held in custody across the country.</t3138>
<t3139>This was such a timely, comprehensive, and effective operation that, two months after the signing of the ceasefire agreement, when Colonel Aureliano Buendia recovered and got back on his feet, the most passionate and enthusiastic organizers were either dead, exiled, or had adapted to the administrative cadres.</t3139>
<t3140>Colonel Aureliano Buendia stepped out of his room in December, and a glance at the veranda was enough to erase the war from his mind.</t3140> <t3141>Ursula, with incredible vitality at her age, had rejuvenated the house.</t3141>
<t3142>When she realized that her son would live, she said, "They will see who I am."</t3142> <t3143>"There will be no house in the world better, more beautiful, and with doors open to everyone than this madhouse."</t3143> <t3144>She had the house plastered from top to bottom, painted, changed the furniture, rearranged the garden, planted new flowers, and opened all the doors and windows wide so that the dazzling summer sun could even enter the bedrooms.</t3144> <t3145>She put an end to the years of accumulated mourning and she herself took off her old clothes and wore colorful garments suitable for the young.</t3145> <t3146>The music of the lantern once again filled the house with joy.</t3146> <t3147>When Amaranta heard the sound of the lantern, she remembered Pietro Crespi, his evening arrivals with gardenias in hand, the scent of lavender, and deep within her pale heart, a pure hatred, cleansed by time, was born.</t3147> <t3148>One day, while Ursula was tidying up the living room, she asked for the help of the soldiers guarding the house.</t3148> <t3149>The young commander of the guards allowed the soldiers to help.</t3149> <t3150>Gradually, Ursula assigned them new tasks.</t3150> <t3151>She fed them, gave them clothes and shoes, and taught them to read and write.</t3151>
<t3152>After the government removed the guards, one of the soldiers stayed at home and served Ursula for many years.</t3152> <t3153>The young commander of the guards, however, went mad because Beautiful Remedios scorned and rejected him, and on New Year's Day, he was found dead under her window.</t3153>
<t3154>Years later, Aureliano Segundo, on his deathbed, would remember that rainy June day when he entered the bedroom to see his first son.</t3154> <t3155>Even though the child was screaming, lying limp like an empty sack, and bore none of the characteristics typical of the Buendias, Aureliano Segundo decided without hesitation what name to give him.</t3155>
<t3156>"His name will be Jose Arcadio," he said.</t3156>
<t3157>Fernanda del Carpio, the beautiful woman Aureliano had married a year ago, accepted what her husband said.</t3157> <t3158>On the other hand, Ursula did not hide her vague suspicion.</t3158> <t3159>According to Ursula, the repeated use of names throughout the family's long history had yielded almost certain results.</t3159> <t3160>While all the Aurelianos were introverted and sensible, the Jose Arcadios were bold and enterprising, but inevitably ran into trouble.</t3160> <t3161>The only case that couldn't be classified was the situation of Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano Segundo.</t3161> <t3162>In their childhood, they were so identical and so mischievous that even Santa Sofia de la Piedad could not tell them apart.</t3162> <t3163>On the day they were baptized, Amaranta put a tag on each of the children's arms and always dressed them in clothes of different colors with their initials embroidered on them.</t3163>
<t3164>However, after the children started school, they began changing their clothes and name tags, calling each other by the wrong names.</t3164> <t3165>The teachers, including Melchor Escalona, who distinguished Jose Arcadio Segundo by his green shirt, were bewildered when they discovered that Jose Arcadio Segundo was wearing the name tag of the other, who, in turn, wore a white shirt and the name tag of Aureliano Segundo.</t3165> <t3166>From then on, they could never be sure which one was which.</t3166> <t3167>Even when the children grew up and life differentiated them, Ursula always wondered if, during that game of deception, the children had mistakenly switched identities permanently.</t3167> <t3168>Until they reached adolescence, they were like two machines operating in perfect harmony.</t3168> <t3169>They woke up at the same time, rushed to the bathroom at the same time, caught the same illnesses, and even had the same dreams.</t3169>
<t3170>The people at home thought they were acting this way to deceive everyone.</t3170> <t3171>However, one day Santa Sofia de la Piedad gave one of the twins a glass of lemonade.</t3171> <t3172>As soon as the child brought the glass to his mouth, the other one jumped in and said that the lemonade was unsweetened.</t3172> <t3173>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who had indeed forgotten to put sugar in the lemonade, told this incident to Ursula.</t3173> <t3174>Ursula was not surprised at all, "They're all like this," she said.</t3174> <t3175>"Crazy from birth."</t3175> <t3176>Over time, the confusion lessened.</t3176> <t3177>At the end of the deception game, the one known as Aureliano Segundo became a broad-shouldered young man like his ancestors, while the one named Jose Arcadio Segundo turned into a thin, bony young man like the colonel.</t3177> <t3178>The only common trait they shared was the air of loneliness unique to the family.</t3178> <t3179>Perhaps it was this contrast in their stature, names, and personalities that gave Ursula the suspicion that the children had been shuffled like a deck of cards since they were born.</t3179>
<t3180>During the most intense days of the war, when Jose Arcadio Segundo told Colonel Gerineldo Marquez that he wanted to watch someone being executed by firing squad, a clear distinction emerged among the children.</t3180> <t3181>Ursula's opposition was in vain, and Jose Arcadio Segundo got his way.</t3181> <t3182>On the other hand, Aureliano Segundo shuddered from head to toe at the mere thought of watching someone being executed by firing squad.</t3182> <t3183>He preferred to stay at home.</t3183> <t3184>When he was twelve years old, he asked Ursula what was in the locked room.</t3184> <t3185>Ursula replied, "Papers."</t3185> <t3186>"Melquiades' books and the strange things he wrote in his final years."</t3186> <t3187>This answer only fueled Aureliano Segundo's curiosity instead of quenching it.</t3187> <t3188>He insisted so much on entering the room and promised so fervently that he wouldn't damage anything that Ursula finally handed him the keys.</t3188> <t3189>No one had entered the room since Melquiades' body had been removed.</t3189> <t3190>The padlock on the door had rusted and corroded from the inside.</t3190> <t3191>Despite all this, when Aureliano Segundo opened the windows, a light entered the room as if it were accustomed to illuminating it every day.</t3191> <t3192>There was no dust or cobwebs to be seen anywhere.</t3192>
<t3193>Everywhere had been swept and cleaned, it was even shinier than the day Melquiades was buried.</t3193> <t3194>The ink in the inkwell had not dried, the metal objects had not rusted or tarnished, and the embers under the still where Jose Arcadio Buendia boiled mercury had not yet gone out.</t3194> <t3195>On the shelves were books covered with something resembling cardboard, yellowed, and tanned, reminiscent of human skin.</t3195> <t3196>The manuscripts had also remained as they were.</t3196> <t3197>Despite being closed for years, the air in the room was cleaner than that of the other rooms in the house.</t3197> <t3198>Everything was so clean that a few weeks later, when Ursula entered the room with a bucket and a brush to scrub the boards, she found nothing to do.</t3198>
<t3199>Aureliano Segundo was dozing, reading a book.</t3199> <t3200>Even though the book had no cover and its name was written nowhere, the child still enjoyed what he was reading.</t3200> <t3201>He was reading the story of a woman who sat at a table and put nothing in her mouth except rice paste which she ate with a stick, the story of a fisherman who borrowed weights from his neighbor to catch fish and in return gifted a fish from whose belly a diamond emerged, the story of a magic lamp that granted wishes, and flying carpets.</t3201> <t3202>Aureliano Segundo, in astonishment, asked Ursula if these were real.</t3202> <t3203>Ursula also said they were true and told him that years ago, gypsies had brought magic lamps and flying carpets to Macondo.</t3203>
<t3204>Then he sighed, "Slowly, the end of the world is coming, such people no longer visit these places," he said.</t3204> <t3205>After finishing the book, most of whose stories were incomplete due to missing pages, Aureliano Segundo started to dismantle the manuscripts.</t3205> <t3206>Deciphering the writings was impossible.</t3206> <t3207>The letters resembled clothes hanging on a line, looking more like musical notes than writing.</t3207> <t3208>One hot afternoon, while Aureliano Segundo was working hunched over the manuscripts, he suddenly sensed he was not alone in the room.</t3208> <t3209>In the light coming through the window, with his hands resting on his knees, Melquiades was sitting.</t3209> <t3210>He was not yet forty years old.</t3210> <t3211>He wore that outdated vest and a hat resembling a crow's wing.</t3211> <t3212>The oil he had applied to his hair had melted in the heat and dripped down his pale temples.</t3212> <t3213>He looked exactly as he had when Aureliano and Jose Arcadio first saw him in their childhood.</t3213> <t3214>Aureliano Segundo recognized him at first glance.</t3214> <t3215>Because memories had passed from generation to generation, and his grandfather's memories had been transmitted to him through heredity.</t3215>
<t3216>Aureliano Segundo said, "Hello."</t3216>
<t3217>Melquides replied, "Hello young man."</t3217>
<t3218>After that, they met every day for several years.</t3218> <t3219>Melquiades would tell him about the world, trying to impart his knowledge to him, but he refused to translate the manuscripts.</t3219> <t3220>"No one should know what is written there before reaching the age of one hundred," he would say.</t3220> <t3221>Aureliano kept his meetings with Melquiades a secret from everyone.</t3221> <t3222>Once, when Melquiades was in the room and Ursula suddenly walked in, Aureliano Segundo thought his private world had been shattered.</t3222>
<t3223>However, Ursula did not see Melquiades.</t3223>
<t3224>-Who were you talking to? he asked.</t3224>
<t3225>-With no one, said Aureliano Segundo.</t3225>
<t3226>"Your great-grandfather used to do the same, he would talk to himself too," said Ursula.</t3226>
<t3227>Meanwhile, Jose Arcadio Segundo had satisfied his curiosity by watching someone being executed by firing squad.</t3227> <t3228>He would never forget the purple glow of the bullets fired simultaneously, the echoing sound hitting the hills, and the surprised eyes and sad smile of the man being executed for the rest of his life.</t3228> <t3229>The man stood upright even when his shirt was soaked in blood, and he was still smiling when they untied him from the post and placed him in a lime-filled coffin.</t3229> <t3230>Jose Arcadio Segundo thought, "He's alive."</t3230> <t3231>"They're going to bury him alive."</t3231> <t3232>This affected him so deeply that from that day on, he hated the military and war, not because of the executions but because the executed were buried alive.</t3232> <t3233>No one understood when Jose Segundo began ringing the church bell, assisting Peter Antonia Isabel, who replaced the Hippopotamus, during masses, and taking care of the fighting cocks in the priest's house garden.</t3233>
<t3234>When Colonel Gerineldo Marquez learned of this, he scolded the young man for engaging in activities opposed and disapproved of by the Liberals.</t3234> <t3235>Jose Arcadio Segundo replied, "To tell you the truth, I think I have become a Conservative."</t3235> <t3236>He said this with a belief as if it were his destiny.</t3236> <t3237>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez became very angry, very anxious, and explained the situation to Ursula.</t3237>
<t3238>Ursula said, "It's better this way."</t3238> <t3239>"I wish he were a priest so that God would finally enter through the door of this house."</t3239>
<t3240>It soon became clear that Father Antonio Isabel was preparing Jose Arcadio Segundo for his first communion.</t3240> <t3241>While they were shaving the necks of their roosters and preparing them for fights, the priest was teaching Jose Arcadio Segundo the necessary knowledge through 'catechism'; as they placed the hens ready to brood into the nests, he explained with simple examples how on the second day of creation, God thought that chicks should hatch from eggs.</t3241> <t3242>The priest had begun to show signs of senility at that time.</t3242> <t3243>This senility would gradually increase, and years later, the priest would claim that perhaps the devil's rebellion against God had ended in victory and that, to deceive the unwary, the devil had hidden his true identity and sat on the throne in the heavens.</t3243>
<t3244>With the guidance and persistence of his teacher, Jose Arcadio Segundo mastered the theological tricks used to outwit the devil within a few months, just as he had mastered the tricks of cockfighting.</t3244>
<t3245>Amaranta sewed a linen garment with a collar and tie.</t3245> <t3246>She bought white shoes.</t3246> <t3247>She embroidered the initials of her name in gold on the ribbon that would be tied to the candle.</t3247> <t3248>Two nights before the first communion, Father Antonio Isabel locked himself in the room where the church's valuable items were kept with Jose Arcadio Segundo to hear his confession.</t3248> <t3249>They had also brought a dictionary of sins with them.</t3249> <t3250>The list of sins was so long that the old priest, who was used to going to bed at six, couldn't stay awake until the end and fell asleep in his chair.</t3250> <t3251>The priest's questions opened up a new world for Jose Arcadio Segundo.</t3251> <t3252>He wasn't surprised when the priest asked if he had done indecent things with women and honestly answered no.</t3252> <t3253>But when he was asked if he had done the same with animals, he was confused.</t3253> <t3254>On the first Friday of May, the communion was held, but his mind was still on the priest's question.</t3254> <t3255>He immediately ran to Petronio.</t3255> <t3256>Petronio was the church's sickly caretaker.</t3256> <t3257>He lived in the bell tower.</t3257> <t3258>It was said that he ate bats.</t3258> <t3259>Jose Arcadio Segundo asked him the question that was troubling his mind.</t3259> <t3260>Petronio replied, "There are immoral Christians who do their business with female donkeys."</t3260> <t3261>Jose Arcadio Segundo wasn't satisfied with this answer, his curiosity was tormenting him, and he asked so many questions in succession that Petronio finally lost his patience.</t3261>
<t3262>"I go on Tuesday nights," he confessed.</t3262> <t3263>"If you promise not to tell anyone, I'll take you next Tuesday."</t3263>
<t3264>Indeed, the following Tuesday, Petronio came out of the bell tower with a wooden stool that no one had known the purpose of until that day and took Jose Arcadio Segundo to a nearby pasture.</t3264> <t3265>The young man became so engrossed in his nightly outings that he didn't appear at Catarino's shop for a very long time.</t3265> <t3266>He became a passionate cockfighter.</t3266> <t3267>The first day he came home with fighting cocks, Ursula scolded him, saying, "Take these damn things out of here."</t3267> <t3268>"Cocks have already brought too much sorrow to this house; there's no need for you to add to it."</t3268> <t3269>Without any resistance, Jose Arcadio Segundo took the cocks out of the house, but he continued to keep them at the house of his grandmother Pilar Ternera, who did anything to have him visit her.</t3269> <t3270>Soon enough, in the cockfighting arena, applying the tricks he had learned from Father Antonio Isabel, he not only increased the number of cocks but also made enough money to consider having some fun.</t3270> <t3271>Ursula compared him to his brother and couldn't understand how the twins, who had been like one person in their childhood, had ended up so differently.</t3271>
<t3272>Ursula's astonishment did not last long.</t3272> <t3273>Because very soon, Aureliano Segundo began to show signs of laziness and disarray.</t3273> <t3274>When he locked himself in Melquiades' room, Aureliano Segundo, like Colonel Aureliano Buendia in his youth, would withdraw into himself.</t3274> <t3275>But shortly after the Treaty of Neerlandia, by chance, he broke out of his introversion and faced the reality of the world.</t3275> <t3276>A young woman selling lottery tickets, with an accordion as the prize, greeted him warmly as if she knew him.</t3276> <t3277>Aureliano Segundo was not surprised by this because he was often mistaken for his brother.</t3277> <t3278>However, he did not attempt to correct the mistake.</t3278> <t3279>In fact, even when the girl tried to soften his heart by crying and eventually took him to her room, Aureliano Segundo did not attempt to explain the situation.</t3279> <t3280>During their very first meeting, the woman warmed up to him so much that she did everything she could to ensure Aureliano Segundo won the accordion.</t3280>
<t3281>After two weeks had passed, Aureliano Segundo realized that the woman thought the two of them were the same man, sleeping with one and then the other; nevertheless, instead of correcting the situation, he preferred to let it continue.</t3281> <t3282>He never returned to Melquiades' room again.</t3282> <t3283>In the afternoons, he would sit in the garden, learning to play the accordion by ear despite all of Ursula's shouting and scolding.</t3283> <t3284>At that time, Ursula had banned music in the house due to mourning.</t3284> <t3285>Moreover, she despised the accordion, considering it an instrument fit only for Francisco's nomadic heirs.</t3285>
<t3286>Nevertheless, Aureliano Segundo became an expert at playing the accordion and, even after getting married and having children, and becoming one of the most respected people in Macondo, he did not stop playing the accordion.</t3286>
<t3287>Aureliano Segundo shared the woman with his brother for two months.</t3287> <t3288>He would watch his brother, disrupt his plans, and after ensuring that Jose Arcadio Segundo would not visit their shared mistress that night, he would go and sleep with the woman.</t3288> <t3289>One morning, he realized he had contracted a disease.</t3289> <t3290>Two days later, he caught his brother in the bathroom, drenched in sweat and tears, clinging to a beam.</t3290> <t3291>Then he understood the situation.</t3291> <t3292>His brother confessed that the woman had thrown him out, accusing him of passing on what she called the disease of a filthy life.</t3292> <t3293>He also explained how Pilar Ternera tried to cure him.</t3293> <t3294>Aureliano Segundo secretly began using those burning permanganate baths and diuretic waters.</t3294> <t3295>After three months of suffering in secret, they both recovered.</t3295> <t3296>Jose Arcadio Segundo never saw the woman again.</t3296> <t3297>Aureliano Segundo, however, made amends and never left the woman until she died.</t3297>
<t3298>His name was Petro Cotes.</t3298> <t3299>She had come to Macondo in the midst of the war, making a living from the lottery with the man who was supposedly her husband, and after his death, she had taken over his business.</t3299> <t3300>She was a young, clean, mixed-race woman with almond-shaped yellow eyes that gave her face a wild panther-like look.</t3300> <t3301>She had a rich heart and a God-given, unparalleled tenderness.</t3301> <t3302>It was as if God had created her to make love.</t3302> <t3303>When Ursula learned that Jose Arcadio Segundo was involved in cockfighting and Aureliano Segundo played the accordion at the noisy gatherings of his mistress, she was stunned by this combination.</t3303> <t3304>It seemed as if both young men had inherited all the family's vices and not a single one of its virtues.</t3304> <t3305>Then Ursula decided that no one would ever be named Aureliano or Jose Arcadio again.</t3305> <t3306>Nevertheless, when Aureliano Segundo had his first son, Ursula could not bring herself to oppose his wish.</t3306>
<t3307>"Okay," he said.</t3307> <t3308>"But I have one condition: I will raise him."</t3308>
<t3309>Even though Ursula had reached the age of one hundred and was almost blind due to cataracts, she had not lost the slightest bit of her vitality, personality, or mental balance.</t3309> <t3310>No one could raise a virtuous man who would uphold the family's honor better than she could.</t3310> <t3311>This man would not even know the names of war, cockfighting, bad women, or daring ventures.</t3311>
<t3312>According to Ursula, these four calamities had brought ruin to their household.</t3312> <t3313>To herself, she promised, "This one will become a priest."</t3313> <t3314>"If God grants me life, one day he will even become the Pope."</t3314> <t3315>When they heard what she said, not only those in the bedroom but also Aureliano Segundo's rowdy friends who had filled the house burst into laughter.</t3315>
<t3316>The war, thrown into the cellar of bad memories, was momentarily recalled with the popping of champagne bottles.</t3316>
<t3317>Aureliano Segundo raised his glass and said, "To Papa's health."</t3317>
<t3318>The guests also raised their glasses, repeating the same words in unison.</t3318> <t3319>Then the man of the house played the accordion, fireworks were set off, and the event was celebrated by drumming in the streets throughout the town.</t3319> <t3320>At dawn, the guests, who had been immersed in champagne, sacrificed six cows and laid the meat of the cows in the street for everyone to take.</t3320>
<t3321>Nobody found it strange.</t3321> <t3322>Since Aureliano Segundo took charge of the house, such exuberance had become commonplace, even when there wasn't a sufficient reason like the birth of a Pope.</t3322> <t3323>Within a few years, Aureliano Segundo, without any effort, purely due to his good luck and the extraordinary reproductive abilities of his animals, had amassed one of the greatest fortunes in the swamp region.</t3323> <t3324>His mares were giving birth to triplets, and they were fattening up so quickly that no one could comprehend such irregular productivity, and it was said that there must be some wizardry involved.</t3324> <t3325>Ursula would say to her enterprising grandson, "Set aside a few pennies."</t3325> <t3326>"Your luck won't last a lifetime."</t3326>
<t3327>But Aureliano Segundo did not care about her.</t3327> <t3328>The more bottles he popped to give his friends champagne baths, the more wildly the animals bred, and Aureliano Segundo believed that his lucky star depended not on his own actions but on the influence of Petra Cotes, whose love conquered nature.</t3328> <t3329>Aureliano Segundo was so convinced that she was the source of his wealth that he never kept Petra Cotes away from the farm.</t3329> <t3330>Even after getting married and having children, he continued to live with Petra with the consent of his wife Fernanda.</t3330> <t3331>Aureliano Segundo, who had a monumental build like his grandfathers and an irresistible charm and vitality they lacked, didn't have much time to take care of the animals.</t3331> <t3332>Taking Petra Cotes to his farm and having her ride across it once on horseback was enough to cause an unstoppable breeding epidemic among all the animals marked with his brand.</t3332>
<t3333>Like many of the spoils in Aureliano Segundo's long life, the origin of that great fortune was also based on luck.</t3333> <t3334>Until the end of the wars, Petra Cotes lived off lottery income.</t3334> <t3335>Aureliano Segundo also continued to occasionally pilfer from Ursula's savings.</t3335> <t3336>Even on days considered sinful, they had become a carefree couple whose only concern was to revel every night until dawn.</t3336> <t3337>Whenever Ursula caught her son staggering into the house like a sleepwalker with his grandchild, she would shout at the top of her lungs, "This woman has ruined you."</t3337> <t3338>"This woman has bewitched you so much that I wouldn't be surprised if one day you start writhing in pain and a black frog comes out of your belly."</t3338> <t3339>Jose Arcadio Segundo, who realized too late that he had lost his place, could never understand his brother's passion.</t3339>
<t3340>The Petra Cotes he knew was an ordinary woman with no special qualities, quite clumsy in bed, and knew nothing about love games.</t3340> <t3341>Aureliano Segundo, having turned a deaf ear to Ursula's yelling and his brother's mockery, could think of nothing but begging Petra Cotes for money to support himself, finding a job, and dying beside, on top of, or underneath her in a night of fiery passion.</t3341> <t3342>When Colonel Aureliano Buendia finally succumbed to the peace of old age and reopened his silver workshop, Aureliano Segundo thought it would be good to devote himself to making ornamental fish.</t3342> <t3343>He would sit for hours in the hot room, watching how the metal sheets, shaped with the incredible patience born of the colonel's disillusionment, transformed into golden fish scales.</t3343> <t3344>This work seemed so laborious and tedious to him, and the thought of Petra Cotes was so persistent in his mind, that after three weeks Aureliano Segundo stopped visiting the workshop.</t3344> <t3345>It was around that time that Petra Cotes came up with the idea of a rabbit lottery.</t3345>
<t3346>Due to the rapid breeding and quick growth of the rabbits, they couldn't keep up with selling the lottery tickets.</t3346> <t3347>Initially, Aureliano Segundo did not notice that the animals were multiplying at an alarming rate.</t3347> <t3348>But one night, when the town was so fed up with rabbits that no one wanted to hear about the rabbit lottery anymore, Aureliano Segundo heard a sound in front of the garden gate.</t3348>
<t3349>Petra Cotes said, "Don't worry."</t3349> <t3350>"They are rabbits."</t3350> <t3351>They couldn't sleep because of the noise from the animals.</t3351> <t3352>At dawn, Aureliano Segundo opened the door and saw that the garden was completely filled with rabbits, which appeared blue in the morning twilight.</t3352> <t3353>Petra Cotes, who was laughing uncontrollably, couldn't help but tease him.</t3353>
<t3354>-Here are the ones born last night, he said.</t3354>
<t3355>Aureliano Segundo exclaimed, "Oh my God!"</t3355> <t3356>"If that's the case, why don't you hold a cow lottery?"</t3356>
<t3357>A few days later, Petra Cotes bartered a cow to rid the garden of rabbits.</t3357><t3358>Two months later, the cow gave birth to triplets.</t3358><t3359>That's how it all started.</t3359><t3360>Within fifteen days, Aureliano Segundo became a land and livestock owner and couldn't keep up with expanding the overflowing cow and pig pens.</t3360><t3361>This was a crazy abundance that even made Aureliano Segundo laugh, and he started doing whatever came to mind to express his joy.</t3361><t3362>"Stop, cows, life is short!" he would shout.</t3362><t3363>Ursula wondered what kind of shady dealings he might be involved in, whether he was stealing or swindling.</t3363><t3364>And every time she saw him popping champagne just because he enjoyed pouring the foam over his head, she would yell at him, scolding him for being wasteful.</t3364><t3365>Tired of Ursula's scoldings, Aureliano Segundo, one cheerful morning, showed up with a chest of money, a bucket of glue, and a brush.</t3365><t3366>And singing Francisco's old songs at the top of his lungs, he plastered one-peso banknotes all over the house, inside and out, from top to bottom.</t3366><t3367>The old house, which had been painted white since the days the lantern arrived, now looked like a mosque in this state.</t3367><t3368>Amid the family's excited shouts, Ursula's screams at the top of her lungs, and the laughter of those gathering in the street to watch this monument to extravagance, Aureliano Segundo papered the house from the entrance to the kitchen, from the bedrooms to the bathroom, and scattered the remaining money in the garden.</t3368>
<t3369>Aureliano Segundo curtly said, "I hope no one in this house talks to me about money anymore."</t3369>
<t3370>That's how it happened.</t3370> <t3371>Ursula had the money removed along with the large pieces of plaster they were stuck to, and the house was painted white again.</t3371> <t3372>"God, I pray that you do not take out the pain of this waste on us in the afterlife; please make us as poor as we were when we first founded this town," Ursula was praying.</t3372>
<t3373>The exact opposite of their prayers happened.</t3373> <t3374>One of the workers who was stripping the money hit a life-sized plaster statue of a saint that someone had brought and left during the last years of the war; when the statue fell to the ground, it shattered into pieces, and inside the statue was filled with glittering gold coins.</t3374> <t3375>None of them remembered who had brought this life-sized statue of the saint.</t3375> <t3376>Amaranta said, "Three men had brought it."</t3376> <t3377>"They said let it stay here until the rainy season ends, and I told them to leave it in the corner so no one would bump into it."</t3377>
<t3378>They placed it there carefully, and since no one came to take it, the statue remained there.</t3378>
<t3379>Later on, Ursula placed candles on the statue and knelt in front of it to pray, without even considering that she was worshipping almost two hundred kilos of gold rather than a saint.</t3379> <t3380>The evidence of this unintended idolatry, scattered all over the place, further confused Ursula's mind.</t3380> <t3381>She spat on the heap of coins, filled a sack with them, and buried it in a secret place.</t3381> <t3382>She hoped that those three unknown people would eventually come and ask for the money.</t3382> <t3383>Much later, during the arduous years of her old age, Ursula began to interrupt the conversations of travelers passing by her house, asking if they had come to her home during the war and left a plaster statue of a saint to be picked up after the rainy season.</t3383>
<t3384>These events, which so surprised and upset Ursula, were considered very ordinary in those days.</t3384> <t3385>Macondo was buried in unprecedented wealth.</t3385> <t3386>In place of the adobe houses of the town's founders, brick structures with cement floors and wooden shutters, which made the oppressive midday heat a bit more bearable, had been erected.</t3386>
<t3387>The only thing left of Jose Arcadio Buendia's village at that time was the river, with its dusty almond trees destined to endure the harshest conditions and the prehistoric stones shattered by Jose Arcadio Segundo's sledgehammer.</t3387>
<t3388>When Jose Arcadio Segundo set his mind on operating a ship to Macondo, he had not left a single stone unturned in the river.</t3388> <t3389>This was a dream that could only be compared to the craziness of his great-grandfather's dreams.</t3389>
<t3390>Because the rocky nature of the riverbed and the presence of currents in places made it impossible to reach the sea from Macondo by water.</t3390> <t3391>But Jose Arcadio Segundo, stubbornly and with a mad audacity, kept insisting.</t3391> <t3392>Until then, he had shown no signs of imagination.</t3392> <t3393>Besides his rootless adventure with Petra Cotes, he had not known any woman.</t3393> <t3394>During the days when Colonel Aureliano Buendia was telling Jose Arcadio Segundo about the Spanish galleon lying about twelve kilometers inland from the sea, whose decayed skeleton he had seen with his own eyes during the war, Ursula knew him as the quietest person in the family, someone who couldn't even manage to stand out in cockfights.</t3394> <t3395>For years, this galleon story, which seemed like a fairy tale to most people, sparked a new idea in Jose Arcadio Segundo's mind.</t3395> <t3396>He sold his roosters at auction, hired men, bought tools, and embarked on the daunting task of breaking rocks, opening channels, clearing currents, and even taming waterfalls.</t3396> <t3397>Ursula was shouting, -I know all of this by heart.</t3397> <t3398>-It's as if time has reversed and we've come back to the very beginning, she was saying.</t3398>
<t3399>When Jose Arcadio Segundo came to the conclusion that the river could be made navigable, he shared his plans with his brother, who then gave him the necessary money for this venture.</t3399> <t3400>Jose Arcadio Segundo disappeared for a long time.</t3400> <t3401>While rumors were spreading that the plan to buy a ship was just an excuse to extort money from his brother, news came that an unprecedented vessel was approaching the town.</t3401> <t3402>The people of Macondo, who had long forgotten the grand ventures of Jose Arcadio Buendia, rushed to the shore and, with eyes wide in astonishment, watched the first and last boat the town would ever see.</t3402> <t3403>This was nothing more than a raft made of planks, being pulled by twenty people walking along the shore with a rope.</t3403> <t3404>Standing at the front of the raft with the joy of accomplishing something in his eyes, Jose Arcadio Segundo was maneuvering with great difficulty.</t3404>
<t3405>There was a heap of beautiful women beside him.</t3405> <t3406>The women had applied colorful creams to their faces, adorned their hair with real flowers, wrapped serpentine gold bracelets around their arms, and embedded diamonds in their teeth.</t3406>
<t3407>They had thin silk shawls on their shoulders.</t3407> <t3408>They had opened colorful and fancy umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun.</t3408> <t3409>The wooden raft became the only boat that Jose Arcadio Segundo could bring to Macondo - and he could bring it only once.</t3409> <t3410>But he never accepted the failure of this endeavor and defended it as a victory of willpower.</t3410> <t3411>He gave a detailed account to his brother, then got caught up in cockfighting again.</t3411> <t3412>The only thing that remained from that ill-fated venture was the new breath the women brought from France.</t3412> <t3413>Their great skills outshone the lovemaking methods known in Macondo until then, and their not being slum girls eliminated Catarino's antiquated shop.</t3413> <t3414>The street where Catarino's shop was located became a marketplace where Japanese lanterns and music boxes playing sentimental songs were sold.</t3414> <t3415>Those women also initiated the carnival that made Macondo a scene of madness for three days and three nights and, apart from giving Aureliano Segundo the opportunity to meet Fernanda del Carpio, provided no other benefit.</t3415>
<t3416>Beautiful Remedios was chosen as the carnival queen.</t3416> <t3417>Ursula, frightened by the intoxicating beauty of her grandson's daughter, could not prevent this selection.</t3417> <t3418>Until then, she had managed to keep the girl away from the street except for going to church with Amaranta, and even then, she made her cover her face tightly with a black veil.</t3418> <t3419>The most godless of men, those who dressed as priests and recited lewd prayers in Catarino's shop, and even those who had the least regard for religion, had started to frequent the church just to catch a glimpse of the legendary beauty of Beautiful Remedios, whose fame had spread throughout the swamp region.</t3419> <t3420>It was only after a very long time that they were able to see Beautiful Remedios's face.</t3420> <t3421>They wished they hadn't, because most of the men were deprived of sleep ever after.</t3421> <t3422>The stranger who made Beautiful Remedios unveil her face lost his mind completely, became miserable and wretched, and years later, fell asleep on the tracks and was torn apart by a train.</t3422> <t3423>When the man appeared in the church in his green velvet suit and embroidered vest, no one doubted that he had come from far away, perhaps from a distant town in a foreign country, drawn by the enchanting allure of Beautiful Remedios.</t3423> <t3424>The young man looked so handsome, so elegant, so polite, so dignified that Pietro Crespi would have seemed like a gaudy dandy next to him.</t3424>
<t3425>The women began to whisper, saying that with such beauty, it was she who should be wearing the veil.</t3425> <t3426>The man did not speak to anyone in Macondo.</t3426> <t3427>At dawn on Sunday morning, he would arrive like a fairy tale prince on a horse with silver stirrups and a velvet-covered saddle, and after the church service, he would leave the town.</t3427>
<t3428>The presence of the young man was so powerful that the moment he stepped into the church, everyone acknowledged that a silent and tense duel had begun between him and Beautiful Remedios, a challenge that would result not only in love but also in death, a secret pact.</t3428> <t3429>On the sixth Sunday, the young man appeared with a yellow rose in his hand.</t3429> <t3430>He watched the ceremony standing, as usual, and when it ended, he went to Beautiful Remedios and extended the rose.</t3430> <t3431>Beautiful Remedios took the rose with a natural gesture as if she had been prepared for this act of respect, then unveiled her face and smiled instead of thanking him.</t3431> <t3432>That was all she did.</t3432> <t3433>For not only the young man but also for all the men who had the unfortunate privilege of seeing her, it was an unforgettable, eternal moment.</t3433>
<t3434>From that day on, the young man began to have serenades performed under the window of the beautiful Remedios.</t3434> <t3435>Sometimes the musicians played until dawn.</t3435>
<t3436>The only person who truly felt close to the young man was Aureliano Segundo.</t3436>
<t3437>He was trying to break the young man's resistance.</t3437> <t3438>One night, he said, "Don't waste your time."</t3438> <t3439>"The stubbornness of the women in this house is worse than a mule's."</t3439> <t3440>He wanted to be friends with the young man, invited him to champagne baths, and exhausted himself trying to explain that the women in his family had hearts of stone.</t3440> <t3441>Yet, he still couldn't break the young man's resistance.</t3441> <t3442>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, tired of the endless music that went on for nights, said he would put an end to the young man's passion with a few bullets.</t3442> <t3443>No matter what they did or said, it didn't work.</t3443> <t3444>However, when the young man became pitifully degraded, he gave up resisting.</t3444> <t3445>Once well-dressed, clean, and dapper, he became slovenly and dirty.</t3445> <t3446>Although it was not known who he was or where he came from, rumors spread that he had turned his back on his position and wealth in a distant country.</t3446>
<t3447>He became a quarrelsome, unruly person.</t3447> <t3448>He started frequenting taverns.</t3448>
<t3449>He was drinking heavily, then sobering up in Catarino's store, soiled and covered in his own filth.</t3449> <t3450>The most painful part was that Beautiful Remedios never noticed him.</t3450> <t3451>Even when he appeared in church like a prince, Beautiful Remedios hadn't paid any attention to him.</t3451> <t3452>She had taken the yellow rose without any malicious intent and with amusement at the extravagance of the gesture, and she had lifted her veil not to show her own face, but to see the young man's face more clearly.</t3452>
<t3453>Actually, Beautiful Remedios was not of this world at all.</t3453>
<t3454>Even long after adolescence, Santa Sofia de la Piedad had to bathe and dress him, and even after he learned to clean himself, he still had to be watched constantly to prevent him from drawing animal pictures on the walls with a stick dipped in his feces.</t3454>
<t3455>He reached the age of twenty without knowing how to read or write, or how to use a fork and knife.</t3455> <t3456>Since his nature was against all traditions, he would walk around the house completely naked.</t3456> <t3457>When the young commander of the guards told her that he loved her, she rejected him because she was startled by his nonsense.</t3457> <t3458>While telling this to Amaranta, she said, "Do you see, what a simple man."</t3458> <t3459>"As if I were an incurable stomach ache, he says he will die because of me."</t3459> <t3460>When they found the commander's dead body in front of her window, Beautiful Remedios' thoughts about him were confirmed.</t3460>
<t3461>"Didn't I tell you, he was a very simple man," he said and got out of the situation.</t3461>
<t3462>He seemed to have an understanding that allowed him to see the reality of events without needing to resort to any formalism.</t3462> <t3463>At least Colonel Aureliano Buendia thought so, believing that Beautiful Remedios was not generally considered to be an idiot, but quite the opposite.</t3463>
<t3464>"You'd think this one is not twenty years old, but has come back after fighting for twenty years," he said.</t3464> <t3465>Ursula, on the other hand, was thanking God for blessing the family with an extraordinarily pure creature, but at the same time, she was uneasy about her beauty.</t3465> <t3466>Because, according to Ursula, the girl's beauty was a contradictory force, a diabolical trap in the midst of her purity.</t3466>
<t3467>For this reason, she tried to keep her away from the world, to protect her from seductive human passions.</t3467> <t3468>However, she didn't know that Beautiful Remedios had been purified from all kinds of evil while still in her mother's womb.</t3468> <t3469>It had never crossed Ursula's mind that they would choose Beautiful Remedios as the queen during the carnival, that day when the devils ran rampant.</t3469>
<t3470>But Aureliano Segundo, who had set his mind on disguising himself as a priest, brought Father Antonio Isabel home just as he had caught him and tried to convince Ursula that the carnival was not a pagan festival, as she thought, but a Catholic tradition.</t3470> <t3471>In the end, Ursula believed what the priest said and, albeit reluctantly, agreed to the girl being chosen as queen.</t3471>
<t3472>The news that Remedios Buendia would be the carnival queen spread beyond the borders of the swamp region within a few hours, reaching distant places where her beauty was unknown, and intrigued and worried those who still saw her surname as a symbol of destruction.</t3472> <t3473>The worries were unfounded.</t3473> <t3474>If there was anyone who had become harmless at that time, it was Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who was aging, collapsing with disappointment, and gradually losing all connection with the realities of the country.</t3474> <t3475>He had shut himself in his workshop.</t3475> <t3476>His only connection to the world was the trade of ornamental fish.</t3476> <t3477>In the early days of peace, one of the soldiers standing guard at the house would take the fish made by Colonel Aureliano Buendia, go around the villages in the swamp selling them, and return with a heap of money and a heap of news.</t3477> <t3478>According to the soldier, the Conservative government had secured the support of the Liberals and was reforming the calendar so that Presidents could stay in power for a hundred years.</t3478>
<t3479>Allegedly, an agreement was signed with the papacy in the end, and a cardinal with a diamond crown and a solid gold throne came from Rome.</t3479> <t3480>Allegedly, the Liberal ministers knelt before the cardinal and kissed his face while having their picture taken.</t3480> <t3481>Allegedly, the lead artist of a Spanish troupe touring the capital was kidnapped by masked bandits and made to perform naked at the president's summer house on Sunday.</t3481> <t3482>The Colonel said, "Don't talk to me about politics."</t3482> <t3483>"Our job is to sell fish."</t3483> <t3484>When the rumor that the Colonel did not want the country's situation to be discussed because he had started making money reached Ursula's ears, she laughed heartily.</t3484> <t3485>With her eerie intuition, Ursula couldn't understand the Colonel's business; how he sold the fish to buy gold, then converted the gold back into silver to make ornamental fish again, then sold them to earn gold once more, and ultimately, how he had to work as much as he sold to maintain this vicious cycle.</t3485>
<t3486>Actually, what interested Colonel Aureliano Buendia was not the business aspect, but the work itself.</t3486> <t3487>Connecting the scales, setting tiny rubies into the eyes, flattening the gills, attaching the fins required such intense concentration that there was no time left to think about the disappointments brought by the war.</t3487> <t3488>Because of this, he deteriorated more in a short time than he had during all those years of war.</t3488> <t3489>Constant sitting had hunched his back, and bending over the work had ruined his eyes.</t3489>
<t3490>However, the extreme intensity granted peace to his soul.</t3490> <t3491>The last time he dealt with a matter related to the war was when a mixed group of fighters from both sides asked for his support.</t3491> <t3492>They had been promised a lifelong pension, but this had never been implemented.</t3492> <t3493>The former warriors wanted the colonel to support them in securing the pension.</t3493>
<t3494>The Colonel said, "It's best to just forget it."</t3494> <t3495>"Look, I didn't accept the pension because I wanted to escape the torture of waiting for it to come, whether it would come or not, until I die."</t3495>
<t3496>Previously, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez would come to her in the afternoons, sitting at the front door and talking about the past.</t3496> <t3497>However, Amaranta, unable to bear the memories this man, who had prematurely fallen into the abyss of old age due to his baldness, stirred in her heart, kept making sarcastic remarks.</t3497>
<t3498>In the end, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez stopped visiting their house except on important days, and later, after he had a stroke, he disappeared altogether.</t3498> <t3499>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, a quiet and reserved man who was indifferent to the new liveliness shaking the house, believed that to have a good old age, one must reconcile with solitude.</t3499> <t3500>After a short sleep, he would wake up at five in the morning, drink his usual black coffee in the kitchen, lock himself in his workshop all day, and at four in the afternoon, dragging his stool, he would pass through the veranda without noticing the flaming rosebuds, the brightness of the sun, or Amaranta's sobs, which resembled the sound of a boiling pot and were clearly heard in the evening silence as she succumbed to melancholy, and he would place the stool in front of the street door, sitting there until the mosquitoes began to bother him.</t3500>
<t3501>Once, someone dared to break the solitude in which the colonel was immersed.</t3501> <t3502>While passing by the door, they asked, "How are you, Colonel?"</t3502>
<t3503>Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, "Here I am, waiting for my funeral procession to pass."</t3503>
<t3504>Therefore, the concerns about the resurgence of the Buendia surname in connection with the election of Beautiful Remedios as queen were unfounded.</t3504> <t3505>Nevertheless, the majority did not share that view.</t3505> <t3506>The townspeople, unaware of what was to come, filled the square in a cheerful commotion.</t3506> <t3507>The carnival madness had reached its peak, and Aureliano Segundo had fulfilled his desire to dress up as a tiger.</t3507>
<t3508>While wandering among the crowd, hoarse from shouting, a few people appeared on the main road coming from the swamp.</t3508> <t3509>They were carrying the most beautiful, most alluring woman one could imagine in a gilded litter.</t3509> <t3510>The people of Macondo, realizing that this woman was not an artificial queen adorned with crepe paper but looked like a real queen with her ermine cloak and emerald crown, took off their masks for a moment to get a better look at her.</t3510>
<t3511>Many people sensed that the main purpose of this arrival was provocation and challenge.</t3511>
<t3512>Aureliano Segundo, however, quickly recovered and declared the newcomers as guests of honor.</t3512> <t3513>Then, with a just and wise gesture reminiscent of King Solomon, he seated Beautiful Remedios and the newly arrived queen side by side on the same throne.</t3513> <t3514>The strangers, disguised as Bedouins, joined the wild festivities until midnight, even adding more color to the carnival with acrobatic performances that reminded the spectators of gypsies, launching fireworks, and participating in the revelry.</t3514>
<t3515>At the height of the fun, someone suddenly disrupted the delicate balance.</t3515>
<t3516>-Long live the Liberal Party! he shouted.</t3516> <t3517>-Long live Colonel Aureliano Buendia!</t3517>
<t3518>The sounds of gunfire, fireworks, and screams of fear drowned out the music, and the joy gave way to an atmosphere of panic.</t3518> <t3519>Even years later, they continued to insist that the aides of the foreign queen were soldiers hiding their rifles in ample Bedouin clothing.</t3519> <t3520>The government denied these accusations with a special statement and promised a thorough investigation into the bloody incident.</t3520> <t3521>But the truth of the matter was never clarified, and the belief persisted that the guards in Bedouin disguise had drawn their rifles and opened fire on the crowd without any provocation.</t3521> <t3522>By the time the commotion settled, the fake Bedouins had left the town.</t3522> <t3523>A heap of dead and wounded lay in the area: Nine clowns, four concubines, seventeen kings of cards, a devil, three folk poets, two French nobles, and three Japanese empresses were sprawled on the ground.</t3523>
<t3524>In the confusion, Jose Arcadio Segundo carried Beautiful Remedios away on his back.</t3524>
<t3525>Aureliano Segundo, with the foreign queen whose clothes were torn and whose ermine cloak was bloodied in his arms, took her home.</t3525> <t3526>The girl's name was Fernanda del Carpio.</t3526>
<t3527>She had been chosen as the queen from among the five thousand most beautiful women in the country.</t3527> <t3528>They had tricked her into coming to Macondo by saying, 'We will make you the queen of Madagascar.'</t3528> <t3529>Ursula cared for her as if she were her own daughter.</t3529> <t3530>Instead of doubting the girl's innocence, the townspeople pitied her naivety. Six months after the massacre, when the wounded had healed and the last flowers on the grave where those who died that day were buried together had withered, Aureliano Segundo went to the distant town where she lived to ask her father for her hand, and they got married in Macondo with a wedding that lasted twenty days and twenty nights.</t3530>
<t3531>Two months after getting married, when Aureliano Segundo dressed Petra Cotes as the queen of Madagascar and took her picture to win her favor, his marriage nearly came to an end.</t3531> <t3532>As soon as Fernanda found out, she packed her dowry chests and left Macondo without even feeling the need to say goodbye.</t3532> <t3533>Aureliano Segundo caught up with her.</t3533> <t3534>After pleading and promising to mend his ways, he managed to bring his wife back home and left his mistress.</t3534>
<t3535>Relying on her strength, Petra Cotes did not panic, nor did she show any sadness.</t3535>
<t3536>It was that man who had made Aureliano Segundo.</t3536> <t3537>Before Aureliano Segundo could escape childhood, when his head was filled with a bunch of absurd dreams that had no connection to reality, Petra Cotes had pulled him out of Melquiades' room and secured him a place in the world.</t3537> <t3538>She had transformed Aureliano Segundo, whom nature had created as a reclusive, solitary person, into a lively, life-loving, sociable individual, instilling in him a zest for life, a fondness for spending money, and a love for revelry, ultimately turning him into the man she had dreamed of since her youth.</t3538> <t3539>Then, as all sons eventually do, Aureliano Segundo got married.</t3539> <t3540>He didn't even dare to tell Petra Cotes that he was getting married.</t3540> <t3541>Falling into a childish behavior, he tried to create unnecessary anger, fights, and resentments so that it would be Petra Cotes who would break off the relationship.</t3541> <t3542>One day, when Aureliano Segundo started to lash out unjustly again, Petra Cotes didn't fall for it and clarified the situation.</t3542>
<t3543>"All these things you've done," he said.</t3543> <t3544>"They mean nothing more than showing that you want to marry the Queen."</t3544>
<t3545>Aureliano Segundo was mortified with embarrassment.</t3545> <t3546>Feigning anger, he said he had been misunderstood, that his good intentions had been abused, and he never went to Petra Cotes again.</t3546> <t3547>Petra Cotes, lying in wait</t3547>
<t3548>Without losing the appearance of a wild animal for even a moment, he watched the wedding festivities, the music, the fireworks exploding, and the wild laughter, as if all of this were one of Aureliano Segundo's usual excesses.</t3548>
<t3549>He calmed those who were saddened by what happened to him and those who pitied his misfortune with a smile, saying, "Don't worry."</t3549> <t3550>"Queens suit my purpose; in the end, I will win."</t3550> <t3551>When a woman from the neighbors brought a bunch of candles for her to light in front of the picture of the lover who left her, Petra Cotes, with astonishing confidence, said, "The only candle that will bring him back is always burning."</t3551>
<t3552>As the woman had guessed, Aureliano Segundo ran to her as soon as the honeymoon was over.</t3552>
<t3553>He had taken his old friends, a street photographer, and the blood-stained ermine cloak along with the crown Fernanda wore at the carnival.</t3553> <t3554>They started to revel and have fun.</t3554> <t3555>At the height of the celebration, Aureliano Segundo dressed Petra Cotes as a queen, crowned her as the sole ruler of Madagascar until her death, and distributed the photograph of her in this guise to his friends.</t3555>
<t3556>Petra Cotes, on one hand, was participating in this game, and on the other hand, she was secretly feeling sorry for Aureliano Segundo, thinking about how frightened he must have been to come up with such an extravagant way of reconciliation.</t3556> <t3557>At seven in the evening, without taking off her queen costume, Petra Cotes received Aureliano Segundo in bed.</t3557> <t3558>Aureliano Segundo had not even been married for two months, but at first glance, the woman realized that things were not going well in the bridal bed and savored the insatiable pleasure of taking revenge.</t3558> <t3559>However, when two days later Aureliano Segundo, not daring to come himself, sent an envoy to negotiate the terms of separation, Petra Cotes realized that she would have to show more patience than she had anticipated.</t3559>
<t3560>Because Aureliano Segundo seemed ready to make any sacrifice to save appearances.</t3560> <t3561>Petra Cotes did not panic this time either.</t3561> <t3562>She made things easier once again by yielding to the desire to separate, reinforcing everyone's view of her as a poor woman.</t3562> <t3563>She kept only a pair of leather boots as a memento from Aureliano Segundo.</t3563> <t3564>Aureliano Segundo always said that he never wanted to take off these boots, even when he died.</t3564>
<t3565>Petra Cotes wrapped her boots in a bundle and hid them at the bottom of the chest, ready to live with memories while waiting without losing hope.</t3565>
<t3566>"Sooner or later, he will come," he was saying to himself.</t3566> <t3567>"Even if it's just to wear these boots, he will definitely come."</t3567>
<t3568>He didn't have to wait as long as he thought.</t3568> <t3569>Aureliano Segundo realized on his wedding night that he would go to Petra Cotes' house long before he reached the age to pull on his boots and wait for death.</t3569>
<t3570>Fernanda was a living dead.</t3570> <t3571>She was born and raised in a city about a thousand kilometers away.</t3571> <t3572>It was a gloomy city where the sounds of the carriages of long-gone governors could still be heard on the cobblestones of deserted streets on dark nights.</t3572> <t3573>At six in the evening, death bells would ring from exactly thirty-two towers.</t3573> <t3574>In the mansion with wooden floors resembling a funeral slab, the sun was never seen.</t3574> <t3575>The cypress trees in the garden, the pale, heavy curtains of the bedrooms, and the arches covered with climbing roses in the garden would completely suffocate the air.</t3575> <t3576>Until she reached her teenage years, Fernanda grew up unaware of the world, except for the melancholic hum of piano lessons that a neighbor had persistently continued for years, resisting taking a nap.</t3576> <t3577>Fernanda would sit in the room of her sick mother, whose skin appeared greenish-yellow in the light seeping through the shutters, listening to the methodical, monotonous, emotionless sounds of the keys, and while she withered away weaving funeral wreaths, she thought that music was the world.</t3577> <t3578>Her mother, burning with evening fever and sweating, would tell her how unparalleled the beauty of the past was.</t3578> <t3579>When Fernanda was very young, on a moonlit night, she had seen a very beautiful woman dressed in white walking towards the small church in the garden.</t3579>
<t3580>The aspect of that image, which never left her sight, that disturbed Fernanda was that the woman looked exactly like her own spouse.</t3580> <t3581>It was as if she had seen her younger self, from twenty years ago.</t3581>
<t3582>Her mother, in between bouts of coughing, would say, "She was the queen who was your great-grandmother."</t3582> <t3583>"She died because she was bothered by the smell while cutting a bunch of onions," she would say.</t3583> <t3584>Years later, when Fernanda began to suspect that she was the spitting image of her great-grandmother, she doubted whether what she had seen as a child was just a figment of her imagination.</t3584> <t3585>But her mother scolded her thoroughly.</t3585>
<t3586>"We are very rich, very powerful," he said.</t3586> <t3587>"One day you will be a queen too."</t3587>
<t3588>Sitting at a long table with linen cloths spread out and silver cutlery placed, only to leave the table finding nothing but sweet rolls and water with little chocolate and plenty of cocoa, Fernanda still believed her mother's words.</t3588> <t3589>Even though her father, Don Fernando, had to mortgage the house to make her a dowry, Fernanda dreamed of a legendary queenship until her wedding day.</t3589> <t3590>This was neither naivety nor a longing for grandeur.</t3590> <t3591>She had been raised that way.</t3591> <t3592>For as long as she could remember, she had relieved herself on a golden seat embroidered with the family crest.</t3592> <t3593>She left the house for the first time at the age of twelve and was placed in a decorated carriage to go to the convent school two streets away.</t3593>
<t3594>His classmates were quite surprised that he sat in a separate corner on a very high-backed chair and did not join them even during breaks.</t3594> <t3595>The nuns would say, "He is not like you."</t3595>
<t3596>-She will be the queen.</t3596> <t3597>Her classmates immediately believed this statement because they had never seen a girl as beautiful, elegant, and distinguished as her.</t3597>
<t3598>After eight years of education, during which she learned to write Latin poetry, play the piano, discuss hunting with young men, theology with bishops, world affairs with foreign heads of state, and matters of the afterlife with the Pope, Fernanda returned to her father's house to spend her days weaving garlands.</t3598> <t3599>She found the house completely empty.</t3599>
<t3600>After staying at home for so long, only a few essential pieces of furniture, silver candlesticks, and a silver dinner set remained; the everyday items had been sold off one by one to cover his school expenses.</t3600>
<t3601>Her mother's fever had started to rise every evening.</t3601> <t3602>Her father, Don Fernando, who dressed in black, wore stiff collars, and carried a gold chain, would give her a silver coin on Mondays to cover the household expenses and would send off the wreaths prepared the previous week.</t3602> <t3603>Her father spent most of his time shut away in his study, and although he occasionally left the house, he would return at prayer time to pray with his daughter, using a rosary.</t3603>
<t3604>Fernanda had no close friends.</t3604>
<t3605>She was unaware of the ongoing bloody wars.</t3605> <t3606>Every day at three o'clock, she continued her piano lessons.</t3606> <t3607>Just as she was beginning to lose her dreams of becoming a queen, one day, the door knocker was struck twice.</t3607> <t3608>When Fernanda opened the door, she saw an officer standing there with a formal demeanor, well-dressed, a scar on his cheek, and a gold medal on his chest.</t3608> <t3609>The officer and her father shut themselves in the study.</t3609> <t3610>Two hours later, her father came to the sewing room and called for her.</t3610> <t3611>-Pack your things, he said.</t3611>
<t3612>-You will go on a long journey.</t3612> <t3613>This is how they brought him to Macondo.</t3613>
<t3614>Life, in a single day, with a merciless slap, crushed him under the full weight of the truths his family had been hiding for years.</t3614>
<t3615>After Fernanda returned home, she locked herself in her room and began to cry, ignoring Don Fernando's explanations and pleas as he tried to erase the traces of this meaningless joke.</t3615> <t3616>She swore not to leave her room until she died.</t3616> <t3617>At that moment, Aureliano Segundo came to get her.</t3617> <t3618>This was an incomprehensible twist of fate.</t3618>
<t3619>Because Fernanda, in that anger and shame, had lied to Aureliano Segundo so that he wouldn't learn her true identity.</t3619> <t3620>When Aureliano Segundo set out to look for her, he knew nothing more than that the girl spoke with the accent typical of the mountainous region and that she wove funeral wreaths.</t3620> <t3621>He searched for her tirelessly.</t3621> <t3622>With the same terrible determination that led Jose Arcadio Buendia to cross the mountains to find Macondo, with the blind pride that drove Colonel Aureliano Buendia into futile wars, and with the mad diligence Ursula showed in continuing her lineage, Aureliano Segundo searched for Fernanda.</t3622>
<t3623>He searched without stopping for a moment, without losing hope for a moment.</t3623> <t3624>When he asked anyone he came across where funeral wreaths were sold, they took him from house to house so he could choose the best one and buy the one he liked.</t3624> <t3625>When he asked for the most beautiful woman in the world, all the women pointed to their own daughters.</t3625>
<t3626>Aureliano Segundo lost himself in foggy paths, wasted times, and the dead-end of disappointment.</t3626> <t3627>He passed through a yellow plain.</t3627>
<t3628>Here, a person's thoughts echoed, and what crossed their mind stood before them like a mirage.</t3628> <t3629>After wandering for weeks without any results, he entered a foreign city where funeral bells were ringing in all its towers.</t3629> <t3630>Although Aureliano Segundo had never seen or heard of it, as soon as he saw the worn walls, the moss-covered broken wooden balconies, and the world's most sorrowful 'Wreaths for Sale' sign on the street door, so faded by the rain that it was almost unreadable, he realized this was the place he had been searching for.</t3630>
<t3631>In that short period, from the moment Fernanda left the house on the arm of the abbess on that freezing morning, the nuns only had enough time to sew the wedding dress and pack countless useless items left over from a family tragedy two hundred years overdue, silver candlesticks, silver tableware, and a golden chamber pot into six chests.</t3631>
<t3632>Don Fernando did not accept the call to go along with the bride.</t3632>
<t3633>After putting his affairs in order, he promised to come in the future, and after blessing and wishing happiness for his daughter, he shut himself in his room, drafting announcements more suited for obituaries, and wrote wedding announcements bearing the family crest.</t3633> <t3634>Throughout their lives, this was the first humane relationship between Fernanda and her father.</t3634> <t3635>That day was truly the day Fernanda was born, and for Aureliano Segundo, it was the day happiness both began and ended.</t3635>
<t3636>Fernanda never went anywhere without her elegant calendar, adorned with gold leaf.</t3636> <t3637>The religion teacher had marked the days of sexual abstinence on this calendar with purple ink.</t3637> <t3638>Once the holy week, Sundays, fasting days, the first Friday of each month, the three months, sacrifices, and the days hindered by menstruation were excluded, Fernanda's useful days were reduced to forty-two, squeezed between purple marks.</t3638> <t3639>Believing that this hostile web of marks would eventually unravel, Aureliano Segundo prolonged the wedding longer than expected.</t3639> <t3640>Ursula, tired of constantly throwing away empty bottles of cognac and champagne to make room to walk in the house, was surprised that the newlyweds slept at different times and in different rooms while fireworks were set off, music played, and lambs were roasted; she wondered if, like herself, Fernanda wore a chastity belt that would eventually become a subject of ridicule in the town and cause a disaster at home.</t3640>
<t3641>Fortunately, Fernanda opened up to him and said that she was waiting for two weeks to pass before letting her husband come near her.</t3641> <t3642>Indeed, at the end of that period, she opened the bedroom door with a reluctance befitting those sacrificed to death.</t3642>
<t3643>Aureliano Segundo saw the most beautiful woman in the world, with eyes like a frightened animal and long copper-red hair spread out on the pillow.</t3643> <t3644>This sight so overwhelmed him that he only later noticed Fernanda was wearing a long-sleeved white nightgown with gold-embroidered edges and a large, round hole just below her navel, reaching down to her ankles.</t3644> <t3645>Aureliano Segundo couldn't hold back and burst into uncontrollable laughter.</t3645>
<t3646>With a laughter that echoed through the house, "I've never seen anything more disgraceful in my life," he said.</t3646> <t3647>"Turns out I've married a nun who has devoted herself to serving the poor."</t3647>
<t3648>After a month had passed and he still couldn't get his wife to take off her nightgown, Aureliano Segundo had Petra Cotes' picture taken dressed as a queen.</t3648> <t3649>Later, when he managed to persuade Fernanda to return home, although his wife yielded to his desires in the excitement of reconciliation, the lovemaking Aureliano Segundo had envisioned while going to fetch her from the town with thirty-two bell towers never materialized.</t3649>
<t3650>Aureliano Segundo found only a sorrowful loneliness there.</t3650> <t3651>Shortly before the birth of their first child, one night Fernanda sensed that her husband had secretly returned to Petra Cotes's bed.</t3651>
<t3652>Aureliano Segundo admitted, "That's how it was."</t3652> <t3653>And with a weary resignation, he said, "I have to do it to prevent the animals from going extinct."</t3653>
<t3654>He had to spend some time persuading his wife to accept such an unheard-of way of feeding an animal.</t3654> <t3655>But when he finally convinced her with indisputable evidence, Fernanda asked for nothing more than his promise not to die in his mistress's bed.</t3655> <t3656>Thus, the three of them continued to live without disturbing each other's peace.</t3656> <t3657>Aureliano Segundo kept both of them happy without neglecting either; Petra Cotes flaunted their reconciliation, while Fernanda acted as if she was unaware of the truth.</t3657>
<t3658>However, this agreement did not help Fernanda integrate with the family.</t3658>
<t3659>All of Ursula's efforts to dissuade Fernanda from wearing the wool scarf around her neck after making love, which caused the neighbors to gossip, were in vain.</t3659> <t3660>No matter how much she pleaded with her daughter-in-law to use the toilet or the bathroom and sell the golden chamber pot to Colonel Aureliano Buendia to make fish, Fernanda did not agree.</t3660> <t3661>Amaranta was so disturbed by her own speech and foul language that she was always on guard to avoid saying something inappropriate, and she spoke in bird language in Fernanda's presence.</t3661>
<t3662>"-Bugu," he said, "-from the stories told by the old people."</t3662>
<t3663>One day, irritated by these sarcastic remarks, Fernanda asked what Amaranta had said, and Amaranta, without any evasion, spoke frankly:</t3663>
<t3664>-I was saying that you are one of those who stir up your own mess.</t3664>
<t3665>After that day, they never spoke to each other again.</t3665> <t3666>If a very urgent situation arose, they still wouldn't speak; instead, they would send their messages to each other in writing.</t3666> <t3667>Despite the family's clear stance against her, Fernanda did not give up on her efforts to force the ancestral customs into the household's order.</t3667> <t3668>She ended the habit of eating in the kitchen and everyone snacking whenever they were hungry, making it mandatory to set the table in the dining room at specific times with linen cloths, silver candlesticks, and silver cutlery.</t3668> <t3669>Turning the matter of meals, which was the simplest daily event for Ursula, into such a pompous issue created a tension that first and foremost incited the usually calm and gentle Jose Arcadio Segundo to rebellion.</t3669>
<t3670>But meals started to be eaten at the table set in the dining room.</t3670> <t3671>It would have been better if it had stopped there.</t3671> <t3672>Fernanda also made it a condition that everyone pray before sitting at the table.</t3672> <t3673>Neighbors started gossiping that the Buendias did not eat like other people but turned the act of eating into a religious ceremony.</t3673> <t3674>Even Ursula's superstitions, which were not based on a deep-rooted tradition but on momentary whims, began to clash with Fernanda's.</t3674> <t3675>Fernanda continued the superstitions she inherited from her family, becoming fixated on a unique and specific belief for every event.</t3675> <t3676>As long as Ursula was able-bodied, the family's old habits continued to some extent, and Ursula managed some things as she saw fit.</t3676> <t3677>However, when Ursula's eyesight failed and she became very old, she was pushed aside, and the strict circle that began the moment Fernanda stepped into the house was completed, making Fernanda the sole authority over the family's fate.</t3677>
<t3678>At Ursula's request, Fernanda scoffed at the cake and confectionery business that Santa Sofia de la Piedad was running, saying it was insignificant and not worth the effort, and ordered it to be stopped without delay.</t3678> <t3679>The doors, which were open from sunrise until bedtime, began to be closed during siesta hours on the pretext that the heat was entering the bedrooms, and over time, they were never opened again.</t3679> <t3680>The branch of agarwood and the loaf of bread that had been hanging above the door since the town was founded were taken down, and in their place, a pouch containing a piece of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was hung.</t3680> <t3681>Colonel Aureliano Buendia noticed these changes and sensed what consequences they might bring.</t3681> <t3682>"We are starting to become noble people," he said.</t3682> <t3683>"At this rate, we might end up overthrowing the Conservatives again and fighting to crown a king over us," he added.</t3683> <t3684>Fernanda was careful not to clash with Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t3684> <t3685>However, deep down, she was disturbed by his independent personality and his opposition to all social norms.</t3685>
<t3686>The colonel's habit of drinking coffee at five in the morning, the disorderliness of his workshop, the worn-out</t3686>
<t3687>Fernanda was irritated by her blanket and sitting on a stool by the street door in the late afternoons.</t3687> <t3688>But no matter how irritated she got, she knew that she shouldn't tighten this loose cog in the family mechanism.</t3688>
<t3689>Because he understood that the colonel, tamed by old age and disappointment, was a wild animal and sensed that when he got angry, he could shake the house to its foundations.</t3689>
<t3690>When her husband tried to name their first child after his great-grandfather, Fernanda couldn't muster the courage to oppose him, as it had only been a year since she had come into the house as a bride.</t3690> <t3691>But when their daughter was born, she insisted on naming the child Renata, after her own mother.</t3691> <t3692>However, Ursula had planned to name the girl Remedios.</t3692> <t3693>After a heated argument in which Aureliano mediated with laughter, they baptized the child as Renata Remedios.</t3693>
<t3694>Fernanda calls her daughter Renata, but her husband's family and the entire town call her Meme, which is short for Remedios.</t3694>
<t3695>At first, Fernanda never spoke about her family, but over time, she couldn't stop praising her father.</t3695> <t3696>When they sat down at the table, she would start talking about her father, describing in great detail how he was free from arrogance and grandeur, almost to the point of reverence.</t3696>
<t3697>Aureliano Segundo, surprised by the unreserved glorification of his father-in-law, couldn't help but start teasing his wife jokingly behind her back.</t3697>
<t3698>The other members of the family did not delay in following him on this matter.</t3698> <t3699>Even Ursula, who took great care to maintain the family's peace and was afraid of causing unrest at home, once couldn't help but say to her great-great-grandchild, -Your grandfather is a saint, your mother is a queen, as long as your father's pot is full, you will never fall, you could even become the Pope.</t3699>
<t3700>Despite everyone except their mother smiling under their breath, the children began to see their grandfather as a legendary figure who wrote religious poems to them in his letters and sent gift boxes so large they barely fit through the front door every Christmas.</t3700> <t3701>These were actually the last remnants of their grandfather's inheritance.</t3701> <t3702>With the gifts that arrived, they set up a shrine in the children's room adorned with life-sized statues of saints.</t3702>
<t3703>The embroidered garments on the backs of these saint statues with glass eyes, which looked almost alive, were many times more beautiful than what the people of Macondo wore throughout their lives.</t3703> <t3704>The dead splendor of the old and cold mansion slowly began to move into the Buendía's house.</t3704>
<t3705>One day Aureliano Segundo couldn't stand it anymore and said, "They sent the family cemetery here."</t3705> <t3706>"Now all that's missing are the tombstones and weeping willows."</t3706> <t3707>Although there was never anything like toys in the boxes that arrived, the children would still eagerly await December all year long.</t3707> <t3708>Because these antique and unexpected gifts brought novelty to the house.</t3708>
<t3709>On the tenth Christmas when little Jose Arcadio was about to be sent to theology school, the gift chest sent by his grandparents arrived earlier than usual.</t3709> <t3710>The chest was tightly nailed, wrapped with a steel strip, and inscribed with 'To the Esteemed Dona Fernanda del Carpio de Buendia' in the usual Gothic letters.</t3710> <t3711>When Fernanda withdrew to her room to read the letter that came with the chest, the children rushed to open it.</t3711> <t3712>As always, with the help of Aureliano Segundo, they broke the seals, opened the lid, emptied the sawdust, and found another long chest inside, clamped with copper bolts and made of lead.</t3712> <t3713>While the children waited impatiently, Aureliano Segundo unscrewed the eight bolts; upon opening the lid and seeing Don Fernando, he screamed and pushed the children aside.</t3713> <t3714>Don Fernando lay there, dressed in black, with a cross placed on his chest.</t3714> <t3715>His entire body was covered with plague sores and marks from being scalded in boiling water.</t3715>
<t3716>Shortly after the birth of Fernanda and Aureliano Segundo's daughters, on an anniversary of the Neerlandia Agreement, the government announced that a jubilee would be held for Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t3716>
<t3717>It was such an incompatible decision with state policy that the colonel objected and said he would not accept this show of respect.</t3717> <t3718>-I am hearing the word "jubilee" for the first time in my life.</t3718> <t3719>Whatever its meaning, there must be something fishy about it, he said.</t3719> <t3720>One envoy after another was coming and going to the silver workshop.</t3720>
<t3721>In the old days, the lawyers in black clothes who used to circle around the colonel like crows came this time older and more distinguished.</t3721> <t3722>When the colonel saw them, just as when they had come last time to end the war, he couldn't stand their endless praises.</t3722> <t3723>He told them to leave him alone, that he was not a national hero as they said, that he was an artist who had lost his memories and wanted nothing more than to spend his life and die among his goldfish.</t3723> <t3724>When he heard that the President himself was planning to attend the ceremony in Macondo to award him a medal of merit, he fumed with anger.</t3724> <t3725>He said he was eagerly awaiting this belated but long-deserved opportunity to shoot the President, and that he would kill the President not for the regime's arbitrary actions or historical mistakes, but because he did not respect an old man who had never harmed him, and he asked the envoys to convey his words exactly to the President.</t3725>
<t3726>His anger was so terrifying that the President canceled his trip at the last moment and sent the medal with a special envoy.</t3726> <t3727>Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, who was under all kinds of pressure from every side, got out of bed despite his paralyzed state and tried to deceive his old comrade.</t3727> <t3728>When Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw the swing chair carried by four people and his old friend, who had shared his victories and defeats since their youth, sitting propped up on pillows, he had no doubt that Gerineldo made this effort to prove their solidarity.</t3728> <t3729>But when he realized the true purpose of Gerineldo's visit, he had him thrown out of the workshop.</t3729>
<t3730>-It seems that having you shot would have been a great favor to you, he said.</t3730> <t3731>-Unfortunately, I realized it too late.</t3731>
<t3732>Thus, the jubilee was celebrated without any family members attending.</t3732> <t3733>By coincidence, the event coincided with carnival week.</t3733> <t3734>But it was impossible to convince Colonel Aureliano Buendia that this was a coincidence.</t3734> <t3735>He kept saying that the government had deliberately created the coincidence to mock him.</t3735> <t3736>He shut himself in his workshop.</t3736> <t3737>He could hear the salute shots in his honor, the playing of the national anthem, and the speeches made in front of the house when the street they lived on was named after him, all from his workshop.</t3737>
<t3738>He was on the verge of crying out of anger, frustrated by his helplessness, and for the first time since his defeat, he lamented not being young anymore.</t3738> <t3739>If he were vigorous, if he had his strength, it would have been nothing to start a bloody war at that moment to sweep away the last remnants of the Conservative regime.</t3739> <t3740>As the last speeches of the ceremony still echoed in his ears, Ursula knocked on the door.</t3740>
<t3741>Colonel, "Do not disturb me."</t3741> <t3742>"I have work to do," he said.</t3742> <t3743>Ursula, in an extremely natural voice, called out, "Open."</t3743> <t3744>"What I have to say has nothing to do with the ceremony."</t3744>
<t3745>Colonel Aureliano Buendia unlocked the door.</t3745> <t3746>In front of him stood exactly seventeen men, of various structures, types, and races, but all marked by a sadness that would distinguish them anywhere in the world.</t3746> <t3747>They were his sons.</t3747>
<t3748>Unaware of each other, they had risen and come one by one from the farthest places upon hearing that a jubilee would be held.</t3748> <t3749>They proudly bore the name Aureliano and their mothers' surnames.</t3749> <t3750>They stayed at the house for three days.</t3750> <t3751>This made Ursula very happy, but it drove Fernanda up the wall.</t3751> <t3752>For three days, the house turned into a battlefield.</t3752> <t3753>Amaranta scattered old papers to find the notebook where Ursula had written the children's names, birth, and baptism dates, then added their current addresses to the notebook.</t3753> <t3754>This list could be considered a summary of the twenty-year war.</t3754>
<t3755>The nocturnal expeditions that the colonel undertook from the dawn he left Macondo with twenty-one men to lead a visionary uprising, to the day he returned home for the last time wrapped in a blanket stiffened with dried bloodstains, could be traced from this list.</t3755> <t3756>Aureliano Segundo did not miss the opportunity to organize a grand campaign and accordion party for his nephews.</t3756> <t3757>Thus, the carnival, which had been lackluster due to the jubilee, was celebrated, albeit belatedly.</t3757> <t3758>The Aurelianos broke half of the dishes in the house, destroyed the rose bushes in the garden while claiming to chase a bull, and shot at and killed the chickens with a rifle.</t3758> <t3759>They made Amaranta dance to the melancholic waltzes of Pietro Crespi.</t3759> <t3760>They dressed Beautiful Remedios in men's pants and made her climb a greasy pole, and they brought a pig covered in filth and released it in the middle of the dining room.</t3760> <t3761>All of this caused Fernanda to fall into a state of distress and take to her bed.</t3761>
<t3762>But the others did not care about the breaking and spilling, because this exuberance had brought a healthy atmosphere to the house, shaken things up, and enlivened the place.</t3762>
<t3763>Initially meeting them with distrust, and even suspecting that some of them were not his own, Colonel Aureliano Buendia greatly enjoyed their exuberance and gave each of them an ornamental fish before leaving.</t3763> <t3764>Even the introverted Jose Arcadio Segundo organized cockfights in honor of his nephews.</t3764>
<t3765>However, since a few of the Aurelianos were skilled enough in cockfighting to immediately detect Father Antonio Isabel's tricks, an unpleasant incident was about to erupt.</t3765> <t3766>Seeing how much fun he could have with these crazy relatives, Aureliano Segundo wanted all of them to stay there and work with him.</t3766>
<t3767>Only one person accepted this proposal.</t3767>
<t3768>Aureliano Triste, a burly mixed-race young man, carried his grandfather's boldness and inquisitive spirit.</t3768> <t3769>Up until that day, he had traveled half the world to try his luck; staying there didn't make any difference.</t3769> <t3770>The others, although they were single, believed that their fates were predetermined and were preparing for it.</t3770> <t3771>They were all skilled craftsmen, good housekeepers, and people who loved to live quietly and peacefully.</t3771> <t3772>Before the young men returned to their scattered homes in various parts of the coastal region, on the first Wednesday of the Easter fast, Amaranta gathered them all, dressed them in their bargaining clothes, and took them to church.</t3772>
<t3773>More for fun than faith, the young men lined up in front of the altar and did not object when Father Antonio Isabel dipped his finger in blessed ash and drew a cross on their foreheads.</t3773> <t3774>When they returned home, the youngest tried to wipe his forehead and saw that the cross mark did not come off: neither did his brothers'.</t3774> <t3775>They washed with soapy water, but it didn't budge.</t3775> <t3776>They rubbed with dirt, it didn't fade.</t3776> <t3777>Finally, they applied ash water and scrubbed with pumice stone, yet they still couldn't remove the cross marks.</t3777> <t3778>On the other hand, Amaranta and the others who participated in the prayer easily cleaned the marks on their foreheads.</t3778> <t3779>As Ursula bid farewell to her grandchildren, she said, "It's better this way."</t3779> <t3780>"From now on, everyone will know who you are."</t3780> <t3781>The Aurelianos lined up like a squad amidst the brass band and exploding fireworks and set off, leaving the townspeople with the impression that the Buendía lineage had enough seed to last for centuries.</t3781>
<t3782>Aureliano Triste, with a cross mark drawn in ash on his forehead, established the ice factory he had dreamed of amidst the creative madness of Jose Arcadio Buendia on the outskirts of the town.</t3782>
<t3783>In a short time, Aureliano Triste, who became well-known and beloved, started looking for a house to bring his mother and his unmarried sister (who was not the colonel's daughter) a few months after his arrival, and he became interested in the large, dilapidated house at the corner of the area.</t3783> <t3784>He asked who the owner was.</t3784>
<t3785>Someone said that it did not have an owner, and that a lonely widow who once ate dirt and plaster in that house used to live there.</t3785> <t3786>They said that in her last years, the woman went outside only twice, wearing a hat adorned with artificial flowers and tarnished silver shoes when she went to the post office to send a letter to the bishop.</t3786> <t3787>They told that only a stone-hearted maid stayed with her, and that the maid killed cats, dogs, and any animals that entered the house, throwing their carcasses into the middle of the street to disturb passersby with the smell.</t3787> <t3788>It had been so long since the last animal's hide dried in the sun that everyone believed the lady of the house and the maid had died years ago, even before the war ended.</t3788>
<t3789>If the house is still standing, they said, it hasn't collapsed because there haven't been harsh winters or winds in recent years.</t3789> <t3790>The hinges were rusted and crooked.</t3790>
<t3791>The doors were held in place by cobwebs.</t3791> <t3792>The windows had swollen from the damp, becoming impossible to open.</t3792> <t3793>Weeds and wildflowers had sprung up between the stones in the garden.</t3793> <t3794>Between the wooden planks, lizards and all kinds of pests had made their nests.</t3794> <t3795>All of this confirmed the belief that no human foot had set foot in the house for at least half a century.</t3795> <t3796>For Aureliano Triste, who liked to act on a whim, such evidence was unnecessary to enter the house.</t3796> <t3797>He pushed the street door with his shoulder.</t3797> <t3798>The door, gnawed away by worms, silently collapsed onto the accumulation of dust and insect nests.</t3798> <t3799>Aureliano Triste stood on the threshold, waiting for the dust cloud to settle so he could make out the interior.</t3799>
<t3800>Then he saw the disheveled woman standing in the middle of the room.</t3800> <t3801>She wore a dress from the past century, and had two or three strands of yellow hair on her bald head.</t3801> <t3802>Her eyes, which had not yet lost their beauty, were large, as if the last stars of hope had also faded.</t3802> <t3803>Her face was wrinkled from the drought of loneliness.</t3803> <t3804>Aureliano Triste, who felt as if he had encountered someone from another world, did not even notice that the woman was pointing an old model gun at him in his astonishment.</t3804>
<t3805>Aureliano Triste murmured, "I'm sorry."</t3805>
<t3806>The woman stands in the middle of a room full of a heap of odds and ends, examining this broad-shouldered giant with a tattooed forehead, and through the cloud of dust, delving into the clouds of other times, she saw the man before her with a double-barreled shotgun on his back and rabbits strung together in his hand.</t3806>
<t3807>In a low voice, -For God's sake, he said.</t3807> <t3808>-They have no right to bring this memory before me.</t3808>
<t3809>Aureliano Triste said, "I want to keep a house."</t3809>
<t3810>The woman pointed the gun, aiming at the cross mark on the young man's forehead without her hand trembling.</t3810> <t3811>She was very determined.</t3811> <t3812>"Get out!" she said.</t3812>
<t3813>That evening, at dinner, Aureliano Triste recounted what had happened.</t3813> <t3814>Ursula, crying, exclaimed, "Oh my God!"</t3814> <t3815>Beating her head, she said, "So, she is still alive!"</t3815> <t3816>The long passage of time, the wars, and daily troubles had made her forget Rebeca.</t3816> <t3817>The only person who never forgot that Rebeca was alive and rotting in that bug hole, and who never forgave her, was the old Amaranta.</t3817> <t3818>When she woke up alone at dawn, shivering from the coldness in her heart, the first thing Amaranta thought of was Rebeca.</t3818> <t3819>While soaping her withered breasts and sagging belly, putting on the corset she wore to straighten her stiffly starched petticoats and bent waist, and changing the black bandage of that terrible penance on her hand, she always thought of Rebeca.</t3819>
<t3820>Amaranta, whether awake or asleep, whether angry or calm, always thought of Rebeca.</t3820> <t3821>Because loneliness had sifted through her memories, burned the longing-filled debris accumulated in the heart of life, leaving behind only the most painful memories, purifying, enlarging, and eternalizing them.</t3821> <t3822>Beautiful Remedios had learned of Rebeca's existence from Amaranta.</t3822> <t3823>Every time they passed by the old house, Amaranta would tell an unpleasant story, a tale steeped in hatred, thus trying to instill in her niece the hatred that persisted in her own heart, hoping it would continue even after her own death.</t3823> <t3824>However, this plan did not work, because Remedios was devoid of any passion, and it was unthinkable for her to share the obsessions of others.</t3824> <t3825>Ursula, who had woven a pain in her heart opposite to Amaranta's, kept Rebeca alive in untainted memories.</t3825>
<t3826>Because the image of the pitiable child brought home with a bag containing the bones of his mother and father outweighed the behavior that led them to erase Rebeca from the family record.</t3826> <t3827>Aureliano Segundo decided to bring Rebeca home.</t3827> <t3828>She would sit with them and be taken care of as needed.</t3828> <t3829>However, Rebeca, who had endured years of pain and deprivation to attain the privilege of solitude, was determined not to trade this privilege for a period of old age disrupted by false displays of kindness.</t3829>
<t3830>In February, when Colonel Aureliano Buendia's sixteen sons returned, Aureliano Triste told them about Rebeca.</t3830> <t3831>All seventeen of them rolled up their sleeves; they changed the doors and windows, painted the front of the house in vibrant colors, repaired the walls, renewed the broken cement, and in half a day gave the house a new look.</t3831> <t3832>But they couldn't get permission from Rebeca to repair the inside of the house.</t3832> <t3833>Rebeca didn't even come to the door.</t3833> <t3834>She waited for this chaotic repair to be completed, then calculated the expenses and, despite the fact that the currency had been out of circulation since the last war, handed a handful of money she still considered valid to her old servant Argenida and sent her away.</t3834> <t3835>It was then that the household realized how disconnected Rebeca was from the world and understood that as long as she lived, they would never be able to pull her out of this stubborn solitude.</t3835>
<t3836>When Colonel Aureliano Buendía's sons came to Macondo for the second time, one of them stayed behind.</t3836> <t3837>This was Aureliano Centeno, who decided to work with Aureliano Triste.</t3837> <t3838>Aureliano Centeno was one of the first to be brought home for baptism, and because he broke almost everything in the house within a few hours of his arrival, Ursula and Amaranta remembered him very well.</t3838> <t3839>Although he was a large child, he grew slowly over time and became a medium-sized, pockmarked man.</t3839> <t3840>But his destructive power remained unchanged.</t3840> <t3841>He would break plates and glasses without even touching them.</t3841> <t3842>He broke so many plates that Fernanda finally decided to buy him zinc plates to save the few pieces left of her precious porcelain.</t3842> <t3843>Even the zinc plates soon became bent and warped.</t3843> <t3844>However, Aureliano Centeno's clumsiness, which even tired himself, was forgiven due to his respectful and courteous behavior that quickly earned the trust of those around him, and his great work ethic.</t3844>
<t3845>He increased ice production so much in a short time that more goods were produced than the town market could handle.</t3845> <t3846>Thereupon, Aureliano Triste thought of expanding the ice trade to other towns across the swamp.</t3846> <t3847>It was then that he decided not only to modernize his own business but also to take the step that would connect the town to the rest of the world.</t3847>
<t3848>-We need to bring a railway here, he said.</t3848>
<t3849>The word "railroad" was heard for the first time in Macondo.</t3849> <t3850>While Ursula was looking at the plan Aureliano Triste had drawn on the table, she thought that it was the offspring of the plans Jose Arcadio Buendia had made when he waged war in the direction of the sunrise, and her belief that history was nothing but repetition was further reinforced.</t3850> <t3851>But Aureliano Triste, unlike his grandfather, neither lost his sleep nor his appetite, nor did he poison anyone's life with nervous breakdowns.</t3851> <t3852>He saw the most foolish plans as if they would come to fruition immediately, calculated the costs, estimated the completion date, and endeavored to realize them without bothering anyone.</t3852> <t3853>The trait Aureliano Segundo inherited from his great-grandfather, which was completely unlike Colonel Aureliano Buendia, was his indifference to mockery.</t3853> <t3854>Just as he had unhesitatingly given money for his brother's absurd waterway project, this time he immediately provided the necessary funds for the laying of the railroad.</t3854>
<t3855>Aureliano Triste examined the calendar, made calculations, and left to return after the rainy season ended.</t3855> <t3856>He was never heard from again.</t3856>
<t3857>Aureliano Centeno, bewildered by the factory's production power, began to engage in various experiments and started making ice from fruit juice instead of water.</t3857> <t3858>Thus, unknowingly and unintentionally, he discovered the main ingredient of sherbet.</t3858> <t3859>Since they had not heard from his brother and he himself had not returned even though the rainy season had ended and summer had passed, Aureliano Centeno planned to change the production of this enterprise, which he now considered his own, and to undertake other ventures.</t3859> <t3860>But at the beginning of the second winter, a woman washing clothes in the stream at noon suddenly screamed in fear, threw herself onto the main street, and started running while shouting.</t3860>
<t3861>"It's coming!" he said.</t3861> <t3862>"Something terrifying like a kitchen dragging an entire village behind it is coming," he explained, out of breath.</t3862>
<t3863>At that moment, the town was shaken by a whistle sound that terrified with its echo and a puff resembling a noisy breath.</t3863> <t3864>For a few weeks, they had been seeing some workers laying down iron and beams, but with their tambourines and whistles, their old songs and dances describing the inventions of wandering geniuses from Jerusalem, they thought the gypsies had come again and that this was a new trick of theirs, so they paid no attention.</t3864> <t3865>But the Macondians, stunned by the whistle sounds, the puffing, and the clattering, rushed out into the street as soon as they collected themselves, and saw Aureliano Triste waving from the locomotive and the first train, adorned with flowers, arriving eight months late.</t3865> <t3866>This bright yellow, innocent train brought to Macondo a heap of doubts and certainties, a heap of sweet and bitter events, a heap of changes, disasters, and feelings of longing.</t3866>
<t3867>The people of Macondo, dizzy with countless and incredible inventions, did not know where their astonishment began.</t3867> <t3868>They sat up all night, watching the dim light of the electric bulbs powered by the generator that Aureliano Triste brought on his second train trip.</t3868>
<t3869>It took them quite a long time to get used to the noise of the power plant.</t3869>
<t3870>The live pictures shown by Bruno Crespi, a merchant who had made his fortune, in the theater with lion's mouth ticket booths, greatly angered the people of Macondo.</t3870>
<t3871>Because someone who died and was buried in one film, causing the audience to shed tears, would come back to life in the next film and appear this time in the guise of an Arab.</t3871> <t3872>The audience, who paid two cents per person for tickets to share in the calamities that befell the actors, were outraged by this deceit and broke the chairs.</t3872> <t3873>Under pressure from Bruna Crespi, the mayor issued a statement explaining that cinema was a visual machine that did not require emotional outbursts from the audience.</t3873> <t3874>After this discouraging announcement, many people considered themselves victims of a new and flashy gypsy trick and decided that their own troubles were enough for them, deeming it unnecessary to shed tears over the fabricated calamities of imaginary people, and thus boycotted the cinema.</t3874>
<t3875>A similar incident occurred when the cheerful and coquettish women from France brought gramophones to play instead of the barrel organ, which for a while endangered the livelihood of the band members.</t3875> <t3876>At first, everyone was curious about what the gramophone was, and the customers of the sinful street were increasing.</t3876>
<t3877>It was said that even respectable ladies who wanted to see this new invention with their own eyes, disguised themselves as workers and went there.</t3877> <t3878>After long observations and detailed examinations, everyone came to the conclusion that this was not a magical mill as initially thought and as French women claimed, but a mechanical trick that could never be compared to something human, touching, and full of daily realities like a band.</t3878> <t3879>The disappointment was so great that even when the gramophone became commonplace and entered every home, no one saw it as a means of entertainment for adults but as a toy that entertained children.</t3879> <t3880>But when the undeniable skill of the magneto phone connected to the train station was tested, things changed.</t3880> <t3881>Those who saw the crank of the magneto thought it was something like the gramophone.</t3881>
<t3882>However, after one of the townspeople spoke on the phone for the first time, even those who never believed in such nonsense were astounded.</t3882> <t3883>It was as if God was testing all surprising abilities and was playing with the Macondians' emotions, mixing the boundaries of reality with enthusiasm and disappointment, doubt and discovery.</t3883> <t3884>The fusion of dream and reality in a single crucible disturbed the ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree, and the ghost began to wander inside the house even at midday.</t3884> <t3885>After the railway was officially opened and the train started arriving every Wednesday at eleven o'clock, and a wooden station with a desk, a telephone, and ticket windows was built, men and women who behaved normally but looked as if they had sprung from a circus began to appear on the streets of Macondo.</t3885>
<t3886>In the town seasoned with the Gypsies' tricks and deceptions, these itinerant trade acrobats couldn't make a long-term living.</t3886> <t3887>These peddlers, who tried to sell a daily diet that would bring peace to the soul after seven days with a pressure cooker with the same brazenness, could only extract money from those who were tired of their persuasions and those always ready to be caught off guard.</t3887>
<t3888>On one of the Wednesdays when the train arrived, Mister Herbert appeared among these clownish-looking men, wearing knee breeches and gaiters, a bowler hat on his head, wire-framed glasses on his eyes, with beady eyes, skinny and saggy cheeks like a rooster's skin, a potbelly, and always showing all thirty-two of his teeth.</t3888>
<t3889>Mister Herbert had his meal at the Buendias'.</t3889>
<t3890>No one noticed that Mister Herbert was at the table until the first bunch of bananas in the dining room was finished.</t3890> <t3891>Aureliano Segundo had encountered him in front of Hotel Jacob.</t3891> <t3892>In his broken Spanish, he was complaining about not finding a place at the hotel.</t3892> <t3893>With the hospitality he showed to most strangers who came to town, Aureliano Segundo took him in and brought him home.</t3893>
<t3894>Mister Herbert was in the hot air balloon business.</t3894> <t3895>He had traveled half the world and made a fortune from this business.</t3895> <t3896>But since the people of Macondo, who had seen the gypsies' flying carpets, considered it a rather backward invention, no one was willing to pay to ride the balloon.</t3896> <t3897>Therefore, Mister Herbert was going to leave on the next train.</t3897> <t3898>When the large bunch of bananas, which everyone was used to seeing hanging in the dining room during meals, was brought to the table, Mister Herbert reluctantly reached out and took one banana.</t3898> <t3899>But he started eating more and more.</t3899> <t3900>He was talking while also absentmindedly, not out of gluttony but with the distraction of a scholar, plucking bananas and popping them into his mouth.</t3900>
<t3901>When he finished the first banana, he asked for another one.</t3901> <t3902>Then he took out some magnifying glasses and mirrors from his toolkit, which he always kept by his side.</t3902> <t3903>As careful as a diamond merchant, he examined the banana thoroughly, cut it in half with a special knife, weighed the pieces on a precise scale, and calculated the diameter of the banana using a caliper typically used for adjusting gun calibers.</t3903> <t3904>Then, taking out more devices from his bag, he measured the temperature, humidity in the air, and light intensity with them.</t3904>
<t3905>These things they did were so complicated that everyone had stopped eating and was waiting to see what kind of judgment Mister Herbert would make.</t3905> <t3906>However, he wasn't saying anything that would indicate what he was thinking or what his intentions were.</t3906>
<t3907>In the following days, they saw Mister Herbert outside the town, catching butterflies with a basket and a net.</t3907> <t3908>On Wednesday, a group of engineers, water engineers, soil engineers, topographers, and surveyors got off the train.</t3908> <t3909>They conducted research for weeks in the areas where Mister Herbert caught butterflies.</t3909> <t3910>Later, Mister Jack Brown arrived in a special carriage attached to the yellow train, painted with gilding, with velvet seats and a blue glass ceiling.</t3910> <t3911>Among those buzzing around Mister Jack Brown in the special carriage were the lawyers in black suits who once never left Colonel Aureliano Buendia's side.</t3911> <t3912>When the people saw these lawyers, they thought that the agricultural engineers, water engineers, topographers, surveyors, hot air balloons with colorful butterflies, Mister Herbert, and Mister Brown with his terrifying German dogs were all related to the war.</t3912>
<t3913>There wasn't much opportunity to think about whether it was so.</t3913> <t3914>Because before the suspicious Macondolans could figure out what was happening, the zinc-roofed wooden houses where foreigners from the other half of the world settled surrounded Macondo, with people hanging on to the seats, corridors, and even the roofs of the trains.</t3914> <t3915>Later, they established a separate town on the other side of the railway for these gringos, who brought their worn-out wives dressed in muslin clothes and large hats covered with veils.</t3915> <t3916>Palm trees lined the streets of this new town.</t3916> <t3917>The houses had shutters on the windows, tiny white tables on the verandas, ceiling fans with propellers, and gardens covered with bluish grass where peacocks and quails roamed.</t3917>
<t3918>This area was surrounded by iron bars.</t3918> <t3919>Electric wires that turned the swallows, which perched on the bars on cool summer mornings, into coal were wrapped around the bars.</t3919> <t3920>No one could understand why these newcomers had come, what their intentions were, and whether they had really come purely out of love for humanity and a desire to help people.</t3920> <t3921>They had already created a great deal of unrest.</t3921> <t3922>The unease they caused was greater, more lasting, and more incomprehensible than the troubles brought by the old gypsies.</t3922> <t3923>These men, once endowed with abilities that were only attributed to God, changed the rainy season, accelerated the harvest period, allowing for multiple crops a year, and moved the river from its usual place to the other side of the town, behind the cemetery, along with its white stones and icy water.</t3923> <t3924>Around that time, they also built a concrete cover over Jose Arcadio's grave like a fortress, so that the smell of gunpowder from the corpse wouldn't poison the water.</t3924> <t3925>For those among the upcoming strangers whose hearts were not burning with the fire of love, they turned the street of love women who came from France into a place much more splendid and expensive than before.</t3925>
<t3926>One Wednesday, they transported a whole train full of prostitutes.</t3926>
<t3927>These were the most skilled women in the art of lovemaking that has persisted since the world was established.</t3927>
<t3928>They were trying a thousand and one ways, reviving the worn-out with strength pastes and ointments, encouraging the timid, satisfying the insatiable, exciting the quietest, giving the necessary lesson to those who were clingy, and rescuing those who were buried in loneliness.</t3928> <t3929>Instead of the old markets filled with colorful and varied goods, Turk Street, where goods from foreign countries were displayed in illuminated shop windows, began to overflow on Saturday nights.</t3929>
<t3930>In the crowd between the gambling tables, shooting galleries, places where fortunes were told and dreams interpreted, and tables laden with roasted meats and drinks, everyone was bumping into each other.</t3930> <t3931>On Sunday mornings, those who had passed out dead drunk and the many who had been struck down by bullets, fists, knives, and bottles in the fights would be gathered from the ground.</t3931>
<t3932>In the early days when this terrible crowd first began to surge, walking on the streets became a problem in itself.</t3932> <t3933>Trucks, crates, belongings, the construction materials of those who saw no need to ask anyone's permission to build houses wherever they found an empty spot, the noise of carpenters, and the indecency of couples making love in broad daylight in hammocks strung up on almond trees made it impossible to go out.</t3933> <t3934>The only sensible place was the neighborhood of the black people from the West Indies.</t3934> <t3935>These quiet people had settled on a street lined with wooden shacks nailed onto stilts.</t3935> <t3936>In the evenings, they would come out in front of their doors and sing soulful, poignant songs.</t3936> <t3937>So many changes happened in such a short time that, eight months after Mr. Herbert's first arrival, the old Macondo residents could no longer recognize their own town.</t3937>
<t3938>Then Colonel Aureliano Buendia said, Look at the trouble we've gotten ourselves into just because we fed a banana to a gringo.</t3938> <t3939>Aureliano Segundo, however, did not hide his joy at the influx of foreigners.</t3939> <t3940>When the house suddenly filled with all sorts of guests and foreigners who loved to eat and drink, it became necessary to build new bedrooms in the garden, expand the dining room, buy a table that could seat sixteen people instead of the old one, and increase the number of plates, dishes, and cutlery.</t3940> <t3941>Even so, they had to take turns sitting down to eat.</t3941>
<t3942>Fernanda had to put aside her shyness and treat even the most uncouth guests like royalty, endure them muddying the veranda with their boots, urinating in the garden, spreading out beds and lying down wherever they fancied for an afternoon nap, and behaving in a manner that showed they had no idea how to talk to or act around women.</t3942>
<t3943>Amaranta was so upset by this rabble's raid that she started eating her meals in the kitchen again, just like before.</t3943> <t3944>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, believing that most of those who came to greet him in his workshop did so not out of love or respect but out of a curiosity to see a historical relic, a museum fossil, bolted his door and shut himself in his workshop.</t3944> <t3945>After that, he was not seen around except for occasionally sitting in front of the street door to get some fresh air.</t3945> <t3946>Ursula, although she had become quite frail and could only walk by holding onto the walls, would become lively and feel a fresh joy on the days when the train's arrival was near.</t3946> <t3947>Ursula would call the four cooks working under the meticulous management of Santa Sofia de la Piedad,</t3947>
<t3948>"Let's prepare some meat and fish," he was saying.</t3948> <t3949>"Everything should be ready, you never know what these foreigners want to eat."</t3949> <t3950>The train was arriving at the hottest time of the day.</t3950> <t3951>At lunchtime, the house turned into a marketplace, the place was shaking from the crowd and noise.</t3951> <t3952>Guests, drenched in sweat and not even knowing who the hosts were, were attacking like an army to grab the best spot at the table, while the cooks, bumping into each other, were carrying soups in huge pots, meats in potfuls, pilafs in large trays, fruits in trays, and ladling lemonade from big barrels.</t3952>
<t3953>There was such disorder, such chaos that Fernanda thought many people were eating twice and was getting angry.</t3953> <t3954>Once, when one of the people at the table mistakenly asked her for the bill, she almost cursed at the man with the festive language of itinerant vegetable sellers.</t3954> <t3955>It had been over a year since Mr. Herbert arrived, and during this time, the only thing the people of Macondo learned was that the gringos planned to grow bananas in the magical region that José Arcadio Buendía and his men had crossed in pursuit of great discoveries.</t3955> <t3956>Two more sons of Colonel Aureliano Buendía, with ash tattoos on their foreheads, came to Macondo upon hearing about this volcanic development, and the reason for their arrival</t3956>
<t3957>"We came because everyone else came," they explained.</t3957> <t3958>This statement also explained why everyone else came.</t3958>
<t3959>The only person unaffected by the banana plague was Beautiful Remedios.</t3959>
<t3960>She had become a young girl of indescribable beauty, distanced herself even more from formalities, purified herself even more from evil and suspicion, and found happiness in her world filled with simple truths.</t3960> <t3961>She couldn't understand why women tortured themselves with corsets and petticoats.</t3961> <t3962>Therefore, she solved her clothing problem by sewing herself a loose robe.</t3962> <t3963>Thus, the feeling of nudity, which she saw as the most appropriate attire within the house, remained unblemished, and she felt as if she were naked under the loose robe.</t3963>
<t3964>They nagged her so much to cut her hair that fell to her hips, to gather it on top of her head with combs and red ribboned braids, that in the end she shaved her hair off completely and made wigs for saint statues from the hair she cut.</t3964>
<t3965>This was a remarkable result of his instinct to simplify everything.</t3965> <t3966>The more he disregarded fashion for comfort, and the more he ignored customs to act as he pleased, the more his incredible beauty stood out; the more captivating he became.</t3966> <t3967>When Colonel Aureliano Buendia's sons first came to Macondo, Ursula thought that the blood in their veins was the same as that of her great-granddaughter Beautiful Remedios, and she remembered.</t3967>
<t3968>Shivering with fear, he warned the girl, "Open your eyes."</t3968> <t3969>"If you marry one of them, your children will have tails like pigs."</t3969> <t3970>The girl was so indifferent to this warning that she dressed up as a man and rolled in the sand to climb the greasy pole.</t3970> <t3971>This unbearable display almost drove her seventeen cousins to fight each other.</t3971> <t3972>That's why the young men didn't stay at home when they came to town.</t3972>
<t3973>The remaining four, at Ursula's insistence, had each rented a room for themselves.</t3973> <t3974>If beautiful Remedios knew about these measures, she would have laughed herself to tears.</t3974> <t3975>Until her death, she never understood that she could not escape the fate of being a woman who disturbed people's peace, and that this fate was a daily trouble for those around her.</t3975> <t3976>Whenever she disobeyed Ursula and entered the dining room, the strangers' appetites were ruined.</t3976> <t3977>It was clearly evident that she was stark naked under her loose nightgown, and there was no way to explain to anyone that shaving her neat head was not an act of defiance, that lifting her skirts to cool her legs was not meant to be provocative, and that licking and sucking her fingers after meals was simply because she enjoyed it.</t3977>
<t3978>The strangers soon realized that wherever Beautiful Remedios passed, a whirlwind of excitement would blow, lasting even hours after, leaving a painful breeze in its wake.</t3978> <t3979>The household did not notice that the strangers sensed this.</t3979> <t3980>Men who had mastered the art of heartache and had experienced love adventures all over the world said that they had never encountered anything more intoxicating than the natural scent of Beautiful Remedios's skin.</t3980> <t3981>Whether it was on the veranda with begonias, in the living room, or anywhere else in the house, it was possible to determine where and exactly when Beautiful Remedios had passed by her scent.</t3981> <t3982>It was a scent that the household did not notice because it was one of the house's unique smells, but strangers immediately distinguished it.</t3982> <t3983>For this reason, only the strangers could understand how the young commander of the guards fell into a deep love and died, and how the young man from distant lands was driven into misery.</t3983>
<t3984>Beautiful Remedios, who was completely unaware of the circle of unrest surrounding her and the troublesome atmosphere she stirred up wherever she went, never harbored the slightest ill will towards men in her behavior, and in the end, with this innocence-born tolerance, she would drive them out of their minds.</t3984> <t3985>Ursula's insistence that she eat in the kitchen with Amaranta so that strangers wouldn't see her actually suited Beautiful Remedios even more.</t3985> <t3986>In this way, she avoided having to conform to any discipline.</t3986> <t3987>In fact, she would eat her meal wherever she wanted.</t3987> <t3988>Moreover, she preferred to snack whenever she felt like it rather than at set times.</t3988> <t3989>Sometimes she would get up at three in the morning, eat her meal, and then sleep all day.</t3989> <t3990>This disorder would continue for a few months until an incident occurred and things returned to normal.</t3990>
<t3991>When things were going quite regularly, Beautiful Remedios would wake up at eleven in the morning, lock herself naked in the bathroom until two, trying to wake up from her seemingly endless sleep while killing the scorpions in the bathroom.</t3991> <t3992>Then she would take water from the basin with a gourd-made dipper and pour it over herself.</t3992> <t3993>This process would take so long and become so ceremonious that someone who didn't know Beautiful Remedios well might think she was worshipping her own body.</t3993> <t3994>However, this bathing ritual had nothing to do with sexuality.</t3994>
<t3995>Beautiful Remedios was lingering in the bathroom because she didn't know how to pass the time until she got hungry.</t3995> <t3996>One day, while Beautiful Remedios was bathing, one of the strangers removed the tiles from the roof and watched her, and he was breathless at the extraordinary sight of the girl's nakedness.</t3996> <t3997>When Beautiful Remedios saw the man's eyes through the broken tiles, her reaction was not embarrassment but fear and panic.</t3997>
<t3998>"Watch out!" he shouted.</t3998> <t3999>"You are going to fall."</t3999>
<t4000>The stranger murmured, "I wanted to see you."</t4000>
<t4001>-Okay, no harm.</t4001> <t4002>Just be careful.</t4002> <t4003>Those tiles are rotten.</t4003>
<t4004>There was a painful bewilderment on the stranger's face.</t4004> <t4005>He seemed to be fighting his instincts to keep this illusion from breaking.</t4005> <t4006>Beautiful Remedios thought the man was afraid the tiles would break and bathed faster than usual to save him from this dangerous situation as soon as possible.</t4006> <t4007>While she was pouring water over herself from the basin, she was also telling the man that the leaves on the roof had rotted from the rain, causing the roof to collapse and filling the inside with scorpions.</t4007> <t4008>The stranger, thinking she was chattering to cover up the tolerance she was showing him, took it a step further when the girl started soaping herself.</t4008>
<t4009>-Let me soap you up, he said.</t4009>
<t4010>-Thank you, but my hands are enough for me.</t4010>
<t4011>The stranger pleaded, "Please, at least let me soap your back."</t4011>
<t4012>-This would be a ridiculous thing.</t4012> <t4013>Does a person ever soap their back?</t4013>
<t4014>Beautiful Remedios, while drying herself, was tearfully begged by the stranger to marry him.</t4014> <t4015>The girl said she would never marry such a simple man who would stand idly for a whole hour without even eating, just to watch a woman bathe.</t4015>
<t4016>In the end, when Beautiful Remedios put on her loose robe, the man couldn't bear having seen with his own eyes, as everyone believed, that she was truly wearing it over her naked skin, and this mystery seemed to brand his soul like a red-hot iron.</t4016> <t4017>Then he removed two more tiles to be able to jump into the bath.</t4017>
<t4018>Beautiful Remedios, with fear, -It is very high.</t4018> <t4019>You will kill yourself, she warned the man.</t4019>
<t4020>The rotten tiles broke with a noise and the man only had time to let out a scream of fear before hitting the cement floor and breaking his head.</t4020> <t4021>He died immediately and lay sprawled on the ground.</t4021> <t4022>When strangers, who had heard the noise from the dining room, came running, they smelled the breathtaking scent of Beautiful Remedios lingering on the man's skin as they lifted his body.</t4022> <t4023>This scent had permeated him so deeply that from the cracks in his head, instead of blood, an amber-colored oily liquid exuding the scent of Beautiful Remedios flowed.</t4023> <t4024>Then they realized that the scent of Beautiful Remedios did not leave men alone even after killing them, penetrating their marrow and bones.</t4024> <t4025>Nevertheless, they did not connect this horrifying accident with the other two men who had died because of Beautiful Remedios.</t4025> <t4026>A new victim was needed for the strangers and the people of Macondo to believe in the legend that Remedios Buendia spread death, not love, around her and to pass this word from mouth to mouth.</t4026> <t4027>The event that would prove this rumor happened a few months later when Beautiful Remedios went to look at the newly built structures with her girlfriends.</t4027>
<t4028>For the girls of Macondo, this had become a new game.</t4028> <t4029>The things they saw made them laugh, surprised them, scared them, and entertained them.</t4029> <t4030>At night, they would sit and recount these outings as if they had dreamed them, talking about them again.</t4030>
<t4031>Faced with the silence of Beautiful Remedios, Ursula's heart couldn't bear to deprive her of this amusement, and one day, on the condition that she wore proper clothing and a hat, she allowed her to go with the girls.</t4031> <t4032>As soon as the girls entered among the structures, a deadly smell filled the air.</t4032> <t4033>The workers were seized by a strange enchantment, sensing they were facing an invisible danger, and most of them felt a desire to cry uncontrollably.</t4033> <t4034>When the men, their eyes glazed over, advanced towards them, Beautiful Remedios and her friends, surprised, took refuge in one of the structures.</t4034>
<t4035>Shortly after, four Aurelianos saved them.</t4035> <t4036>The ash crosses on the foreheads of the Aurelianos endowed them with a sacred dignity, considered a mark of a certain caste, a sign of inviolability.</t4036>
<t4037>Beautiful Remedios did not tell anyone that in the chaos, one of the men clutched his stomach with a hand that resembled an eagle's claw gripping the edge of a cliff.</t4037> <t4038>She briefly locked eyes with the man attacking her, and Beautiful Remedios saw the pain in his eyes.</t4038> <t4039>Those eyes, filled with pain, burned her heart like two hot coals.</t4039> <t4040>That night, while boasting about his daytime audacity and strutting around in Turks Street, the man suddenly received a kick to his chest from a horse.</t4040> <t4041>Strangers who gathered around watched as the man, coughing up blood and choking on his own blood, died in the middle of the street.</t4041>
<t4042>After that, the assumption that Beautiful Remedios possessed deadly powers was proven by four undeniable events.</t4042> <t4043>Although some men who spoke without thinking claimed they would sacrifice their lives for a night of lovemaking with such an attractive and seductive woman, it was clear that no one dared to attempt such a thing.</t4043> <t4044>Perhaps not only to possess her but also to eliminate the dangers she created, a very primitive and simple emotion was sufficient.</t4044> <t4045>Falling in love would have been enough.</t4045> <t4046>But such a simple thing did not occur to anyone's mind or heart.</t4046> <t4047>Ursula no longer worried about her.</t4047> <t4048>At a time when she had not yet lost hope in raising her, she had tried to teach the girl household chores.</t4048> <t4049>"Men expect more than you think," she had said.</t4049> <t4050>"You need to cook, sweep the place, and deal with trivial matters and make them your concern."</t4050>
<t4051>Ursula was keeping herself busy by trying to teach her household chores and make her enjoy them.</t4051> <t4052>Because she believed that no man would be able to tolerate the girl's incredible sloppiness for even a day after satisfying his passion.</t4052>
<t4053>The birth of her son Jose Arcadio and Ursula's intention to raise him to become a pope distracted her from worrying about her great-grandson.</t4053>
<t4054>Ursula decided to leave Beautiful Remedios to her own fate.</t4054> <t4055>She believed that in this world where everything exists, there would also be a lazy man willing to put up with her sloppiness.</t4055> <t4056>Amaranta, on the other hand, had long given up on turning her into a useful woman.</t4056> <t4057>On the days when her niece couldn't properly turn the machine's handle, Amaranta had decided that the girl was mentally retarded.</t4057> <t4058>Seeing that Beautiful Remedios was not affected by the words of men, Amaranta would tease her, saying, -We'll have to put you in the lottery and sell you.</t4058>
<t4059>Later, when Ursula forced the girl to wear a veil over her face while going to church, Amaranta thought that this mysterious demeanor would be very enticing and that soon enough, a man who got captivated would show patience until he found a weak spot in the girl's heart.</t4059> <t4060>But when she saw that Beautiful Remedios rejected a suitor who, in many ways, could not be exchanged even for princes, Amaranta lost all hope.</t4060> <t4061>Fernanda, on the other hand, did not make the slightest effort to understand Beautiful Remedios.</t4061> <t4062>When she saw Beautiful Remedios dressed as a queen at that carnival, she thought she was an extraordinary creature.</t4062> <t4063>But when she saw her diving into her food with her hands, unable to give a single response that wasn't an example of foolishness, she did nothing but lament the long lives of the fools in the family.</t4063>
<t4064>No matter how much Colonel Aureliano Buendia tried to say that Beautiful Remedios was the smartest person he had ever seen in his life and that she constantly demonstrated this power with her ability to blame everything on others, no one listened to him and they left Beautiful Remedios to her own devices.</t4064> <t4065>Beautiful Remedios began to wander in the desert of loneliness without carrying her cross on her back, and to mature in her dreams without seeing nightmares.</t4065> <t4066>Her endless baths, untimely meals, and long, pensive silences continued on.</t4066> <t4067>Nothing changed until one day in March when Fernanda wanted to fold the sheets in the garden and called the women in the house to help her.</t4067> <t4068>They had just started folding the sheets when Amaranta saw that Beautiful Remedios had turned completely pale.</t4068>
<t4069>"Aren't you well?" he asked.</t4069>
<t4070>Beautiful Remedios, clinging to the other end of the sheet, replied with a pitiable smile, "No, I've never been this good."</t4070>
<t4071>Beautiful Remedios had just finished speaking when Fernanda heard a slight breeze billow and open the sheets in her hand.</t4071> <t4072>Amaranta felt a mysterious shiver in the lace of her petticoats and had to cling tightly to the sheet to avoid falling to the ground.</t4072> <t4073>Because at that moment, Beautiful Remedios' feet had lifted off the ground, and she had started to fly.</t4073> <t4074>At that time, Ursula, who was almost completely blind, was the only one who understood what this distinct breeze was, and she let go of the edges of the sheets and began to watch Beautiful Remedios wave among the fluttering sheets as she ascended with them.</t4074> <t4075>The sheets and Beautiful Remedios rose among the dahlias and cicadas, and by four o'clock, they had disappeared at a height unreachable even by the highest-flying birds.</t4075>
<t4076>Of course, the outsiders did not believe what was told and thought that Beautiful Remedios had succumbed to the inevitable fate of the queen bees, and that her family was trying to save her honor by fabricating this tale of flight.</t4076>
<t4077>Driven mad by jealousy, Fernanda finally had to accept this miracle.</t4077> <t4078>In the meantime, she did not forget to pray and ask God to send her sheets back.</t4078>
<t4079>Most of the people of Macondo believed in miracles.</t4079> <t4080>They even lit candles and held prayer ceremonies.</t4080> <t4081>This event would have been talked about for a long time, but the barbaric slaughter of the Aurelianos replaced astonishment with horror.</t4081>
<t4082>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, although he had never seen a definite sign, had foreseen the tragic ends of his sons.</t4082> <t4083>When his two sons, Aureliano Serrador and Aureliano Arcaya, who had come along with those flocking to Macondo, said they wanted to stay in Macondo, their father tried to dissuade them.</t4083> <t4084>He couldn't understand what his sons were doing in this town, which had become a dangerous place overnight.</t4084>
<t4085>However, Aureliano Centeno and Aureliano Triste, supported by Aureliano Segundo, gave them work.</t4085> <t4086>Colonel Aureliano Buendia opposed this decision, saying that they were not yet able to think clearly.</t4086> <t4087>Especially when he saw Mister Brown in the orange car with a canopy, scaring the dogs with the horn of the first automobile to arrive in Macondo, and witnessed the people running around with a slave-like excitement, the old soldier went mad with rage.</t4087> <t4088>He realized that since the days when men left their wives and children and went to war with rifles on their shoulders, people's morals and structures had changed.</t4088>
<t4089>After the Treaty of Neerlandia, the mayors were always figureheads, lacking initiative, chosen from among the docile and weary Conservatives of Macondo.</t4089> <t4090>Whenever Colonel Aureliano Buendia saw the barefoot policemen with their wooden batons, he would say, "This is a regime of the miserable."</t4090> <t4091>"A bunch of slackers have gathered," he would say.</t4091> <t4092>"We fought and worked so hard just to avoid painting our houses blue," he would say.</t4092> <t4093>However, after the banana company set foot in Macondo, the local officials were replaced by foreigners with dictatorial aspirations.</t4093> <t4094>According to Mister Brown, they were placed in an area surrounded by electric chicken wire to ensure they gained the respect their positions required and were not disturbed by the heat, mosquitoes, countless discomforts, and deprivations in the town.</t4094> <t4095>The old policemen were replaced by hired killers armed with machetes used for cutting cane.</t4095>
<t4096>Colonel Aureliano Buendia had shut himself in his workshop, pondering these changes.</t4096>
<t4097>For the first time during the years he spent buried in loneliness, he felt pain, horrified by these events that determined how wrong it was not to carry the war to the end, and he felt regret.</t4097> <t4098>While the Colonel was thinking about these things, the brother of Colonel Magnifico Zlisbal, who had long been forgotten, wanted to give sherbet to his seven-year-old grandson from one of the itinerant vendors roaming the field with their carts.</t4098> <t4099>The child accidentally bumped into a policeman and spilled the sherbet on the policeman's uniform.</t4099> <t4100>The barbarian brute chopped the child into pieces with the cleaver in his hand and with one blow, decapitated the grandfather who tried to stop him.</t4100> <t4101>While a few people were taking the dismembered man to his home, the entire town witnessed this incident.</t4101> <t4102>A woman was dragging the man's severed head by the hair and carrying the child's dismembered parts, which she had stuffed into a bloody sack, in her hand.</t4102>
<t4103>This was the last straw for Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4103>
<t4104>He was now experiencing a similar rage to what he had felt when he saw the corpse of a woman who had been beaten to death because she was bitten by a rabid dog in her youth.</t4104>
<t4105>He looked at those gathered in front of the house and, with a deep voice filled with anger and disgust towards himself, he unleashed the hatred he could no longer bear in his heart upon them with all its intensity.</t4105>
<t4106>"These days, I will arm my sons so that we can get rid of these damned gringos!" he roared.</t4106>
<t4107>That week, in various places along the coastal region, the colonel's seventeen sons were shot like rabbits by unknown killers aiming at the ashen cross marks on their foreheads.</t4107><t4108>Aureliano Triste was shot by a bullet fired in the dark that pierced through the middle of his forehead as he was leaving the house with his mother at seven in the evening.</t4108><t4109>Aureliano Centeno was lying in his hammock at the factory, as usual.</t4109><t4110>An ice axe was embedded between his eyebrows.</t4110><t4111>After leaving the cinema with his lover, Aureliano Serrador dropped the girl off at her home and was walking through the brightly lit Turkish Street when someone from the crowd, whose identity could not be discerned, drew his gun and shot the young man in the forehead, causing him to fall into a boiling cauldron of pig fat.</t4111><t4112>A few minutes later, the door of the room where Aureliano Arcaya had secluded himself with a woman was pounded on.</t4112><t4113>Someone shouted, "Get out, they are killing your brothers."</t4113><t4114>According to the woman who was with him, Aureliano Arcaya jumped out of bed, and as soon as he opened the door, his head was shattered by the Mauser bullets that rained down on him.</t4114>
<t4115>On that night when death was prowling, while the household was preparing to light candles and pray for the four dead, Fernanda was frantically running through the streets searching for Aureliano Segundo.</t4115> <t4116>However, Petra Cotes, thinking that everyone named after the colonel would be killed, had hidden Aureliano Segundo in a cupboard.</t4116> <t4117>From the telegrams coming from various places in the coastal region, it was understood that the wrath of the unseen enemy was directed only at the brothers with the cross mark on their foreheads, and for four days and four nights, Petra Cotes did not take Aureliano Segundo out of the cupboard.</t4117>
<t4118>Amaranta took out the notebook in which she wrote information about her nephews and crossed out the names as telegrams arrived.</t4118> <t4119>Only the eldest remained.</t4119> <t4120>They remembered him very well because of the contrast between his very dark skin and his bright green eyes.</t4120> <t4121>His name was Aureliano Amador, he worked as a carpenter and lived in a village squeezed between the mountains.</t4121> <t4122>After waiting two weeks for the telegram that would bring news of his death, Aureliano Segundo sent a man to warn him, thinking he might not be aware of the danger looming over him.</t4122> <t4123>The man brought news that Aureliano Amador was alive.</t4123> <t4124>On the night of the massacre, two men had gone to his house, emptied their guns on him, but had missed the mark of the ashen cross.</t4124> <t4125>Aureliano Amador had jumped over the garden wall and escaped through the mountain crevices he knew like the back of his hand, befriending the Indians from whom he used to get wood.</t4125>
<t4126>He was never heard from again.</t4126>
<t4127>Those days were dark days for Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t4127>
<t4128>The President sent a telegram expressing his condolences and promised that a wide-ranging investigation and inquiry would be launched.</t4128> <t4129>Again, by the President's order, the mayor bought four wreaths and attended the funeral.</t4129> <t4130>While trying to place the wreaths on the coffins, the colonel drove him away.</t4130> <t4131>After the funeral, he wrote a harsh telegram to the President and took it to the post office by hand.</t4131>
<t4132>The telegraph operator reported that he could not send this.</t4132> <t4133>Upon this, the colonel put the telegram in an envelope, expanding and enriching it with personal attacks and insults, and mailed it.</t4133> <t4134>As in the case of his wife's death, and the deaths of his closest friends during the war, this time too, the emotion he felt was not sorrow, but a blind and aimless rage, a sense of helplessness.</t4134> <t4135>He even accused Father Antonio Isabel of being an accomplice to the murderers for marking his sons with identifying signs that helped their enemies recognize them.</t4135>
<t4136>The senile priest, who could no longer organize his thoughts and bewildered the congregation with his nonsensical comments during his sermons, came home on that Wednesday when the children went to church, clutching the ash jar he had prepared, and attempted to mark the foreheads of the household members to prove that the ash would wash off.</t4136> <t4137>However, this disaster had instilled such terror in everyone that even Fernanda did not consent to this experiment.</t4137> <t4138>After that, it was never seen that anyone from the Buendia family knelt before the altar on Ash Wednesday before Easter.</t4138>
<t4139>Colonel Aureliano</t4139> <t4140>Buendia couldn't pull himself together for a long time.</t4140> <t4141>He stopped making fish.</t4141> <t4142>He could barely eat a few bites, dragging his blanket, grinding his teeth in anger, wandering around the house like a sleepwalker.</t4142> <t4143>After three months, his hair turned white, and the mustache he used to oil and curl so brightly hung down from the sides of his colorless lips.</t4143> <t4144>But his eyes regained that fiery, coal-like intensity that had surprised those present at his birth and had made chairs shake with his gaze when he was a child.</t4144> <t4145>The Colonel, driven mad with pain and anger, tried in vain to revive the intuitions that had guided him through the swamps of fame and glory in his youth.</t4145>
<t4146>He was utterly lost, left all alone in a house that felt completely foreign to him, where nothing and no one inside stirred even the slightest flicker of affection in his heart.</t4146> <t4147>Once, in the hope of finding a trace from the pre-war years, he opened Melquiades' room and was met with a heap of dust, filth, and debris accumulated from years of neglect.</t4147>
<t4148>Among the covers of books that no one reads anymore, within the moldy manuscripts decayed from dampness, a flower of a leaden color tinged with purple had bloomed, and this room, which was once the brightest and most airy place in the house, had filled with a heavy air of decayed memories.</t4148> <t4149>One morning, the Colonel found Ursula under the chestnut tree, crying, clinging to the knees of her dead husband.</t4149> <t4150>The strong old man, worn out from being in the open air for half a century, was Colonel Aureliano Buendia, the only one in the big house who could not see.</t4150> <t4151>Ursula said, -Say hello to your father.</t4151>
<t4152>The colonel paused for a moment in front of the chestnut tree and once again realized that the emptiness before him did not evoke any love within him.</t4152>
<t4153>-What is my father saying? he asked.</t4153>
<t4154>Ursula said, "I am very sad."</t4154> <t4155>"She is sad because she thought you were going to die."</t4155>
<t4156>The colonel responded with a smile: "Tell him," he said, "a person dies not when the time comes, but when they are able to die."</t4156>
<t4157>The prophecy of his dead father stirred the last remnants of pride in the colonel's heart.</t4157> <t4158>However, the colonel mistook this for a new source of strength.</t4158>
<t4159>Therefore, he tried to pressure Ursula to find out where in the garden she had buried the money that came out of the plaster saint statue.</t4159> <t4160>With the determination she had learned from past lessons, Ursula said, "You will never learn this."</t4160> <t4161>Then she added, "The owner of that fortune will come one day, and only they will retrieve the money."</t4161> <t4162>No one could understand why a man who was always extremely generous suddenly became so concerned about money.</t4162> <t4163>Moreover, the money he wanted was not to meet an urgent need.</t4163> <t4164>When Aureliano Segundo heard the amount of the fortune the Colonel was looking for, he was astounded.</t4164> <t4165>The former party friends he asked for money from were pretending not to be home and hiding everywhere to avoid meeting the Colonel.</t4165> <t4166>It was around that time that Colonel Aureliano Buendia was heard saying, "Today, the only difference between the Liberals and the Conservatives is that the Liberals go to church at five o'clock, while the Conservatives go at eight o'clock."</t4166>
<t4167>Despite all this, the colonel insisted so much, begged so much, and humiliated himself so much that, by getting help from here and there, by going everywhere and asking for money, he collected more money in eight months than Ursula had buried.</t4167> <t4168>Then he went to the bedridden Colonel Gerineldo Marquez to ask him to be by his side and assist him when he went to war.</t4168>
<t4169>In a certain period, even if he was in a wheelchair, the only person who could truly pull the rusty strings of the uprising was Colonel Gerineldo Marquez.</t4169>
<t4170>Neerlandia; after the armistice agreement was made, while Colonel Aureliano Buendia immersed himself in his golden fish, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez maintained his relationship with the rebel officers who had remained loyal to him until the final defeat.</t4170>
<t4171>He fought the battle of humiliation and degradation with them every day.</t4171> <t4172>Requests, wishes, 'come today, go tomorrow's, 'it will be done's, 'it's imminent's, 'we are carefully reviewing your situation's joined the battle with them.</t4172> <t4173>He struggled with them in the lost battles against the letters ending with 'respectfully' from those who should have signed the lifelong pension decisions but didn't.</t4173>
<t4174>The other war, that bloody war which lasted twenty years, had not worn them out as much as this war of endless postponements.</t4174> <t4175>Even Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, who had survived three assassinations, five wounds, and countless battles, could not withstand the relentless siege of waiting and succumbed to old age, dreaming of Amaranta among the diamond-shaped light patches seeping through the windows of a rented house.</t4175>
<t4176>He saw the latest news about the old soldiers in a newspaper.</t4176> <t4177>His former comrades-in-arms, whose names and identities he didn't know, had shamelessly posed for pictures next to the President.</t4177> <t4178>The President had given them each a badge with his own picture on it and a flag stained with blood and gunpowder to be draped over their coffins.</t4178> <t4179>The more honorable ones among them, however, were trying to get by with the help of others while waiting for the letter informing them of their pension, dying of hunger, cleansing themselves of anger, and decaying while crawling through the remnants of their former glorious days.</t4179>
<t4180>This is why Colonel Gerineldo Marquez couldn't help but pity Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who wanted him to join the life-and-death struggle to sweep away this corrupt, rotten, despicable regime supported by foreign invaders.</t4180>
<t4181>"Ah, Aureliano," he sighed.</t4181> <t4182>"I knew you were getting old, but now I see that you have aged much more than you appear."</t4182>
<t4183>In the bewilderment of her later years, Ursula didn't have much opportunity to raise Jose Arcadio in a manner befitting a Pope, and in the blink of an eye, the time came for the child to enter the seminary.</t4183> <t4184>His sister Meme, meanwhile, spent her days caught between Fernanda's rigidity and Amaranta's bitterness, and reached the age to attend the convent school.</t4184> <t4185>At this school, they would train her to become a piano virtuoso.</t4185> <t4186>Ursula couldn't quite determine whether the methods she used to shape and mold the soul of the papal candidate were effective.</t4186> <t4187>Nevertheless, she did not accept that she hadn't been able to devote enough attention to Jose Arcadio because she was now very old, barely able to move around, or unable to see her surroundings clearly due to the cataracts over her eyes; if there was any flaw in the child's upbringing, she believed it stemmed from the corruption of the times they lived in.</t4187>
<t4188>As I hear that daily realities and events slip away from my grasp,</t4188>
<t4189>"Years don't pass like they used to nowadays," she was saying.</t4189> <t4190>Ursula used to think that it took a long time for children to grow up.</t4190> <t4191>To prove this thought, it was enough for her to remember the past of her own children.</t4191>
<t4192>How much time had passed since his eldest son, Jose Arcadio, left with the gypsies.</t4192> <t4193>How many things had happened until Jose Arcadio returned, covered in snake-like mottled paints, speaking like an astronomer.</t4193> <t4194>How many changes had occurred in the house until Amaranta and Arcadio forgot the Indian language and learned Spanish.</t4194>
<t4195>Poor Jose Arcadio Buendia, how many times had he sat under the chestnut tree, baking in the sun, getting soaked by dew drops.</t4195> <t4196>They had mourned for a long time thinking Colonel Aureliano Buendia was dead, but when the colonel was finally brought back in a critically wounded state, they saw that despite all the years filled with wars and suffering, the colonel was not even fifty yet.</t4196> <t4197>In the past, Ursula would spend her entire day making animal-shaped sweets, yet she would still find time to take care of the children, looking into their eyes and determining when they needed castor oil.</t4197>
<t4198>However, now she had no work or occupation, she could wander around from morning till night with Jose Arcadio leaning on her hip, but time had become so corrupted that every task she started remained unfinished.</t4198> <t4199>The truth was different, of course: although Ursula had lost track of her own age, she could not accept that she had grown old, wanting to meddle in everything and unsettling those around her, disturbing the peace by asking strangers who came to the house if they had left a statue of a saint there to be picked up after the rainy season during the war.</t4199>
<t4200>No one knew for sure when Ursula's eyes had started to fail.</t4200> <t4201>Even in the years when she was so frail that she couldn't get out of bed, everyone thought she was bedridden because she was physically weak, not realizing she was blind.</t4201>
<t4202>Ursula had noticed this even before Jose Arcadio was born.</t4202> <t4203>At first, she thought the defect in her eyes was a temporary result of fatigue, so without letting anyone know, she boiled bones and drank their marrow, and applied honey to her eyes.</t4203>
<t4204>However, he soon realized that this was not something temporary, but that he was being constantly engulfed in darkness.</t4204>
<t4205>The deterioration in her eyesight reached such a point that she couldn't fully grasp even an invention like the electric bulb, because when the electricity was turned on, Ursula's eyes could only perceive a faint light.</t4205><t4206>Ursula didn't mention this to anyone, because once people realized she couldn't see, they would be convinced that she had become useless.</t4206><t4207>To see the things obscured by the curtain that had fallen over her eyes with the help of her memory, Ursula firmly imprinted in her mind where objects were placed, the distances between them, and people's voices.</t4207><t4208>Later, she found an unexpected helper.</t4208><t4209>In the dark world, smells became more defining than the color and mass of objects.</t4209><t4210>By distinguishing smells, Ursula freed herself from the shame of admitting that she had succumbed to nature.</t4210>
<t4211>In the darkness of her room, she could thread a needle and sew on a button, and she could tell when the milk was about to boil.</t4211> <t4212>She knew the location of everything with such precision that sometimes she forgot she was blind.</t4212> <t4213>Once, Fernanda lost her engagement ring, turned the house upside down, couldn't find it, but Ursula found the ring on a shelf in the children's bedroom.</t4213> <t4214>The reason was simple.</t4214> <t4215>While the others wandered around the house without paying attention to what they were doing, Ursula mobilized all her senses with full force to avoid being caught off guard.</t4215> <t4216>Soon, she noticed that everyone in the family unconsciously performed the same actions every day, followed the same paths, and repeated almost the same words at nearly the same times.</t4216> <t4217>It was only when they deviated from their daily routines that they risked losing something.</t4217>
<t4218>So when Fernanda lost her ring and panicked, Ursula remembered that on that day, unlike usual, she had entered the children's room, found a bedbug in Meme's bed, and put the mattresses out in the sun.</t4218> <t4219>Since the children were in the room, she guessed that Fernanda might have placed her ring on the shelf, the only place they couldn't reach.</t4219> <t4220>However, Fernanda was searching in vain in the places she frequented daily and didn't realize that daily habits made it harder to find lost items.</t4220>
<t4221>Taking care of and raising Jose Arcadio helped Ursula keep track of the smallest changes in the house.</t4221> <t4222>When she noticed that Amaranta was sewing clothes for the saint statues in her bedroom, Ursula, pretending to teach Jose Arcadio the colors, would say, "Come on, tell me, what color is the garment on Archangel Raphael's back?"</t4222>
<t4223>Ursula, by doing this repeatedly, learned from the child what she couldn't discern with her eyes.</t4223> <t4224>When Jose Arcadio reached the age to go to theology school, Ursula had learned to distinguish the colors by touching the garments of the saints.</t4224>
<t4225>Unexpected accidents happened from time to time, of course.</t4225>
<t4226>One day, while Amaranta was doing embroidery on the veranda with begonias, Ursula bumped into her.</t4226>
<t4227>Amaranta, -For God's sake, watch where you're going, she scolded.</t4227>
<t4228>Ursula said, "It's your fault."</t4228> <t4229>"You are not sitting in your usual place."</t4229>
<t4230>Ursula was confident in the truth of what she said.</t4230> <t4231>That day, she sensed something that the others did not notice.</t4231> <t4232>According to the season, the sun was changing its position, and those sitting on the veranda were unknowingly adjusting their positions according to the sun.</t4232>
<t4233>After that, Ursula began to figure out where Amaranta was sitting by thinking about which month and which day it was.</t4233> <t4234>Even though her hands were trembling more noticeably each day and she could barely lift her feet to walk, Ursula's petite body roamed every corner of the house.</t4234> <t4235>She was as active and industrious as she had been when she shouldered almost all the burden of the house.</t4235> <t4236>In the insurmountable loneliness of old age, Ursula could scrutinize family events in every detail, now appreciating the truths she couldn't see in the old days amidst a thousand tasks.</t4236>
<t4237>At the time they were preparing to send Jose Arcadio to the seminary, Ursula had summarized, compiled in detail, and completely changed her opinion about her children and grandchildren regarding the family's life from the founding of Macondo to that day.</t4237>
<t4238>She realized that Colonel Aureliano Buendía had not, as she once thought, become hardened and detached from his family and family love during the years of war.</t4238> <t4239>She came to believe that the Colonel had never loved anyone, not his wife Remedios, nor the countless one-night women who entered his life, nor his sons, not in the slightest.</t4239> <t4240>Úrsula sensed that the Colonel had not fought all those wars for ideals, as everyone thought, nor had he given up on achieving definitive victory because he was exhausted, as everyone believed, but solely because of his pride, he had both won and lost.</t4240> <t4241>In the end, she concluded that her son, for whom she would not hesitate to give her life, was a man devoid of the ability to love.</t4241>
<t4242>Ursula, when she was pregnant, had heard the child crying in her womb one night.</t4242> <t4243>The sound was so distinct that even Jose Arcadio Buendia, who was lying beside Ursula, woke up and was very happy, thinking their son would become a ventriloquist.</t4243> <t4244>However, the neighbors, upon hearing about this event, said that the child would become a prophet.</t4244> <t4245>Yet Ursula believed that this faint moaning, which she heard so deeply, was a sign of the pig's tail she always feared, and she prayed to God for the child to die in her womb.</t4245> <t4246>But after growing old and going through the experiences of many years, Ursula realized that the crying of children in the womb was not a sign of ventriloquism or a harbinger of prophecy, but an undeniable proof of the inability to love.</t4246> <t4247>When her son fell from grace, the feelings of affection and pity that Ursula had never felt the need to show him until that day surfaced in her heart.</t4247>
<t4248>On the other hand, in the final analysis, it turned out that Amaranta, who frightened Ursula with her stone-heartedness and scared her with her deliberate malice, was the most compassionate, most loving woman in the world.</t4248>
<t4249>Ursula saw with a broken heart that the torment Amaranta inflicted on Pietro Crespi was not, as everyone thought, out of a sense of revenge, nor was the stubbornness that poisoned Colonel Gerineldo Marquez's life, as everyone believed, due to malice, but rather it was the result of a deadly conflict between an unbounded love and an insurmountable fear.</t4249> <t4250>And Amaranta's fear of her own heart had ultimately outweighed all other emotions.</t4250> <t4251>Around that same time, Ursula began to speak frequently about Rebeca.</t4251>
<t4252>He remembered her with a love exalted by belated regret and unexpected admiration, and saw that the impatient heart, fiery womb, and boundless courage that Ursula longed for in her own lineage were present only in Rebeca.</t4252>
<t4253>He understood that Rebeca, who had not been nourished by Ursula's milk, who had grown up eating dirt and plaster, and who carried in her veins the blood of strangers whose bones rattled in their graves rather than Ursula's blood, was the only person who possessed all the qualities he longed for.</t4253>
<t4254>Ursula, while walking by holding onto the walls, kept saying, -Rebeca, it turns out we have wronged you so much.</t4254>
<t4255>The household thought that he was starting to go senile.</t4255> <t4256>Especially when he started walking around with his right arm raised like the archangel Gabriel, this belief among the household members became even more reinforced.</t4256> <t4257>However, Fernanda noticed that a great sun of intuition was shining in the shadow of these meaningless wanderings.</t4257> <t4258>For instance, without any hesitation, Ursula could tell exactly how much money had been spent in the house the previous year, down to the last cent.</t4258>
<t4259>One day, while Ursula was stirring soup in the kitchen, without knowing that Amaranta and Fernanda were listening to her, she mentioned that the corn mill they had bought from the first gypsies who came to Macondo, and which they had lost long before Jose Arcadio circled the world sixty-five times, was still in Pilar Ternera's house. Upon hearing this, Amaranta also believed that her mother had an extraordinary power of intuition.</t4259> <t4260>Pilar Ternera, who herself was nearing a hundred years old but remained vigorous and agile despite her incredible obesity, and who once scared pigeons with her laughter and now frightened children, was not at all surprised that Ursula's words turned out to be true.</t4260>
<t4261>Because he knew from his own experiences that a meticulous old age reached much more accurate decisions than playing cards.</t4261>
<t4262>In this state of affairs, Ursula was horrified when she realized that she had not found enough time to prepare Jose Arcadio for his duty on the path of God, and she let herself go.</t4262> <t4263>Trying to see with her eyes the things she could discern better with her intuition, she started making mistakes - One morning, mistaking a large bottle of ink for rosewater, she poured it over Jose Arcadio's head.</t4263> <t4264>She was so persistent in meddling in everything that, in the end, her clumsiness disturbed her own peace, and she tried to free herself from the shadows that enveloped her like a straitjacket made of cobwebs.</t4264> <t4265>Ursula decided that this clumsiness was not the victory of old age and the darkness that clouded her eyes, but a judgment of time.</t4265> <t4266>She thought that everything was different in the times when the Turks measured cotton fabrics by the yard and God did not deceive people so much about months and years.</t4266>
<t4267>However, in the present time, not only do children grow up faster, but emotions also change.</t4267> <t4268>As soon as beautiful Remedios flew to heaven, the emotionless, thoughtless, disrespectful Fernanda started lamenting not for the girl but for her flying sheets.</t4268> <t4269>Before the bodies of the Aurelianos had even cooled in their graves, Aureliano Segundo had redecorated the house with lights, filling it once again with drunken accordion players bathed in champagne.</t4269>
<t4270>It was as if the dead were not Christians but stray dogs.</t4270> <t4271>It was as if the fate of this madhouse, which had cost Ursula so many headaches, so many cakes and sweets, was to decay and collapse, becoming a heap of rubbish.</t4271>
<t4272>While Ursula was preparing Jose Arcadio's trunk, she was also thinking that it would be better to enter the grave and be covered with soil than to witness all of this.</t4272>
<t4273>He was fearlessly rebelling against God, demanding an account, "Do you think the people whose lives you have filled with so much trouble and misery are made of iron?"</t4273>
<t4274>The more he dwelled on this question, the more his mind became completely confused, and he felt an irresistible urge to leave and wander aimlessly like a stranger.</t4274>
<t4275>He wanted to grant himself the right to rebel, even if just for a moment, in the end.</t4275>
<t4276>He was burning with the desire to fulfill this longing, which he had postponed countless times, to mess everything up, to spill out all the harsh words and curses he had swallowed for the sake of avoiding unpleasantness for an entire century, and to unburden himself.</t4276>
<t4277>"Bok!" he shouted.</t4277>
<t4278>Amaranta, who was about to put the child's clothes into the chest, thought that a scorpion had stung her mother.</t4278> <t4279>In a panic, she asked, "Where?"</t4279>
<t4280>Amaranta, -Bug, she said.</t4280>
<t4281>Ursula pressed her finger to her heart.</t4281>
<t4282>-Here, he said.</t4282>
<t4283>On Thursday at two o'clock, Jose Arcadio set out to go to theology school.</t4283> <t4284>Ursula would always remember him as he was at the moment she saw him off, dignified and calm.</t4284> <t4285>The child, as Ursula had taught him, did not shed a single tear, standing there sweating from the heat in his green corduroy suit with brass buttons and starched collar.</t4285> <t4286>Jose Arcadio emerged from the dining room, enveloped in the faint scent of rosewater that Ursula had poured on his head so he could find his way inside the house.</t4286> <t4287>During the farewell feast, the household tried to appear cheerful to hide their nervousness, reacting to Father Antonio Isabel's words with exaggerated curiosity and excitement.</t4287>
<t4288>But when they took out the velvet-covered chest with silver corners, it felt as if a funeral procession was leaving the house.</t4288> <t4289>The only person who did not want to participate in this farewell scene was Colonel Aureliano Buendía.</t4289>
<t4290>"This was a shortcoming," he muttered.</t4290> <t4291>"Now we've got the Pope on our hands too!"</t4291>
<t4292>Three months later, Aureliano Segundo and Fernanda took Meme to school.</t4292> <t4293>On their way back, they brought a small piano instead of the lantern.</t4293>
<t4294>At that time, Amaranta also began to sew her own shroud.</t4294>
<t4295>The passion for bananas had lost its initial momentum.</t4295> <t4296>The old Macondo residents found themselves surrounded by newcomers.</t4296> <t4297>They had to work excessively to regain their past earnings.</t4297> <t4298>Even so, they saw themselves as the fortunate ones who had survived a shipwreck and were grateful for their situation.</t4298> <t4299>There was never a shortage of guests coming to dine at the Buendía house.</t4299> <t4300>The old order of the house could not be reestablished until years after the banana company left Macondo.</t4300>
<t4301>There were significant changes in the usual concept of hospitality.</t4301> <t4302>Because at that time, it was Fernanda who had the final say at home.</t4302> <t4303>When Ursula withdrew into the shadows and Amaranta devoted herself to sewing her shroud, the former queen candidate was free to do as she pleased.</t4303> <t4304>She would choose and accept the guests she wanted and tried to forcibly impose the strict rules she had learned from her family on these guests.</t4304> <t4305>In a town where outsiders behaved as they pleased in the arrogance of their easily acquired wealth, Fernanda's strict rules turned the house into a bastion of old customs.</t4305> <t4306>According to Fernanda, consistent individuals were those who had no connection whatsoever with the banana company.</t4306> <t4307>Even her brother-in-law, Jose Arcadio Segundo, fell victim to her jealousy.</t4307> <t4308>Because he too, in the excitement of the early days, had left the cockfighting business and joined the banana company as a foreman.</t4308>
<t4309>Fernanda said decisively, "As long as your brother condones the rudeness of those strangers, he will not set foot in this house."</t4309>
<t4310>The restrictions at home were so annoying that Aureliano Segundo felt more comfortable at Petra Cotes' house.</t4310> <t4311>At first, under the pretext of not wanting to burden his wife too much, he moved his wild parties to Petra Cotes' house.</t4311>
<t4312>Then, using the excuse that the animals were losing their fertility, he moved their pens and stables there.</t4312> <t4313>Finally, with the excuse that his mistress's house was cooler, he moved the small office where he managed his affairs there.</t4313>
<t4314>By the time it dawned on Fernanda that she was a widow whose husband had not yet died, it was already too late, and there was no way to return to the old situation.</t4314> <t4315>Aureliano Segundo would come to dinner once in a blue moon, and even the things he did to keep up appearances, like sleeping with his wife, did not fool anyone.</t4315> <t4316>One night he drifted off and spent the night in Petra Cotes' bed.</t4316> <t4317>Contrary to expectations, Fernanda neither reproached him nor showed the slightest sign of resentment, but on the same day, she packed his clothes into two trunks and sent them to his house.</t4317>
<t4318>Fernanda sent the trunks in broad daylight and told the porters to walk down the middle of the street so everyone could see.</t4318> <t4319>She hoped that this way, her wayward husband would be ashamed and return home with his head down.</t4319> <t4320>However, this tear-jerking heroism once again proved that Fernanda not only did not understand her husband's personality but also how different the society they lived in was from her own family's views.</t4320> <t4321>Because those who saw the trunks being carried down the street considered this event as the natural outcome of a story everyone knew very well.</t4321> <t4322>Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, celebrated his newfound freedom by throwing a party that lasted three days and three nights.</t4322> <t4323>To her misfortune, while Fernanda entered a pitiful old age with her modest long dresses, outdated medallions, and misplaced pride, her husband's mistress, dressed in colorful silk garments and with eyes gleaming with the light of victory, seemed to be entering a second youth.</t4323>
<t4324>Aureliano Segundo, caught up once again in the fervor of youth, fell for his mistress anew.</t4324> <t4325>They made love with a passion reminiscent of the days when Petra Cotes thanked God for giving her a lover who, because she confused him with his twin brother, made love to her as if he were two different men.</t4325> <t4326>This rekindled love was so powerful that, on numerous occasions, just as they were about to sit down for a meal, they would catch each other's eyes, cover the food without a word, and, dying of hunger and passion, throw themselves into the bedroom.</t4326> <t4327>Inspired by the things he saw during his secret visits to French brothels, Aureliano Segundo bought Petra Cotes a canopy bed.</t4327>
<t4328>He had velvet curtains installed on the bedroom windows, and covered the walls and ceiling with large crystal mirrors.</t4328> <t4329>He became more generous, more extravagant, and more cheerful than ever before.</t4329> <t4330>Every day, he had crates of champagne and cognac delivered by the train that arrived at eleven.</t4330>
<t4331>When returning from the station, he would load the liquor bottles onto a makeshift cart and, whether local or foreign, familiar or yet to be known, he would pull the cart in full view of everyone.</t4331> <t4332>Even Mister Brown, who spoke in a strange language, was captivated by Aureliano Segundo's behavior, and after coming to Petra Cotes' house a few times and getting drunk, he even played the accordion and hummed Texas tunes, making his dog, who never left his side, dance to the music.</t4332>
<t4333>Aureliano Segundo appears at the height of the party's excitement,</t4333>
<t4334>"Stop already, you cows, life passes in the blink of an eye!" he was shouting.</t4334>
<t4335>Aureliano Segundo had never been as healthy and cheerful as he was in those days, never been so loved, and the animals had never reproduced so quickly.</t4335> <t4336>The garden had turned into a black mud from the blood of countless pigs, cows, and chickens slaughtered at his endless parties.</t4336> <t4337>Heaps of bones and intestines piled up in the garden, and the garbage pits where the remains were thrown were filled to the brim.</t4337> <t4338>They had to constantly set off dynamite to prevent hawks and falcons from gouging out the guests' eyes.</t4338>
<t4339>Aureliano Segundo grew a belly from eating and drinking with a gluttony similar to Jose Arcadio's when he returned from his travels around the world, and his face turned purple.</t4339> <t4340>Aureliano Segundo's gluttony, reckless spending, and unprecedented hospitality became legendary; his fame spread beyond the boundaries of the swamp region and reached the ears of the most renowned gluttons of all the towns and cities along the coast.</t4340> <t4341>Food enthusiasts began to flock from all directions.</t4341> <t4342>Gluttony and endurance tournaments were organized at Petra Cotes' house.</t4342> <t4343>Until that fateful Saturday when Camila Sagastume, a woman known throughout the country as 'The Elephant' and resembling a totem, arrived, no one could defeat Aureliano Segundo in the gluttony contest.</t4343>
<t4344>When Camila arrived, the eating duel between her and Aureliano lasted from Saturday to Tuesday morning.</t4344> <t4345>In the first twenty-four hours, Aureliano Segundo, who devoured beef with a garnish of Jerusalem artichoke, cassava, and fried plantains, along with one and a half cases of champagne, considered victory to be in the bag.</t4345> <t4346>He appeared more lively and enthusiastic than his opponent, who was more professional but did not excite the large crowd that filled the house.</t4346> <t4347>Dizzy with the intoxication of victory, Aureliano Segundo stuffed large chunks into his mouth, while the Elephant, with the precision of an operator, cut his meat and ate it unhurriedly, even savoring it.</t4347> <t4348>The woman was a giant, a creature of immense proportions.</t4348>
<t4349>Even on her large frame, there was an air of feminine softness.</t4349>
<t4350>Her face was so beautiful, her hands so neat and well-groomed, and her demeanor so attractive that Aureliano Segundo couldn't help but murmur that he would prefer to compete in bed rather than at the table upon seeing her.</t4350> <t4351>Later, when he saw the woman eat half a calf without losing any of her elegance and fully adhering to table manners, he confidently declared that this beautiful, attractive, and insatiable elephant was the ideal woman.</t4351> <t4352>He was not mistaken.</t4352> <t4353>Even before she was called 'Elephant,' she was known: they called her 'Bone Crusher.'</t4353> <t4354>However, there was no truth to this saying.</t4354> <t4355>As rumored, the Elephant was not a bearded lady or a gluttony queen displayed in a Greek circus, but the director of a music school.</t4355> <t4356>She had learned to eat a lot after getting married and having children.</t4356> <t4357>She had avoided feeding her children artificial appetite stimulants like vitamins or medicines, trying to ensure they developed a natural appetite to stay healthy, and in doing so, she had accustomed herself to gluttony to set an example for them.</t4357>
<t4358>The method he tried to instill in his children and applied himself was based on the principle that if one's conscience is clear, they can eat until they are exhausted from fatigue.</t4358>
<t4359>He had come here, leaving his home and school, with such a moralistic view and sportsmanlike excitement to compete with Aureliano Segundo, who was renowned throughout the country as a man without principles who indulged in gluttony whenever he felt like it.</t4359>
<t4360>Camila, at the first sight of Aureliano Segundo, understood that he would lose the race not because of the weakness of his stomach, but because of his personality.</t4360>
<t4361>At the end of the first night, while the Elephant continued eating tirelessly, Aureliano Segundo had started to wear himself out with a barrage of chatter and laughter.</t4361> <t4362>They took a four-hour sleep break.</t4362> <t4363>When they woke up, both had breakfast with forty glasses of orange juice, eight liters of coffee, and thirty raw eggs each.</t4363> <t4364>By the time they reached the second morning, after a sleepless night during which they consumed two pigs, a bunch of bananas, and four cases of champagne, the Elephant sensed that Aureliano Segundo, without realizing it, had found his own method from an unexpected angle of irresponsibility.</t4364>
<t4365>In this state, it was more dangerous than the Elephant's trunk.</t4365> <t4366>However, when Petra Cotes brought two turkeys roasted to a golden brown to the table, Aureliano Segundo was about to burst.</t4366>
<t4367>Fil said, "If you can't do it, don't force it."</t4367> <t4368>"Let's declare a draw."</t4368>
<t4369>He had said this from the heart.</t4369> <t4370>Because he understood that if he took one more bite, it would lead to his opponent's death, and for this reason, he did not want to eat.</t4370> <t4371>However, Aureliano Segundo interpreted the woman's words as a challenge and ate more turkey than he could handle.</t4371> <t4372>Then he lost consciousness.</t4372> <t4373>With his mouth foaming like a dog, groaning bitterly, he collapsed face down into the plate filled with bones.</t4373> <t4374>In that great darkness, it felt as if he was being thrown from the top of a high tower into a bottomless pit.</t4374> <t4375>For a moment, he came to his senses and realized that at the end of this endless fall, death was waiting for him.</t4375>
<t4376>-Take me to Fernanda, he managed to say.</t4376>
<t4377>His friends carried him home and left with the relief of helping him fulfill his promise not to die at his mistress's house.</t4377> <t4378>Petra Cotes had polished and prepared the boots he wanted to be buried in; while she was looking for someone to send them, his friends arrived and informed her that Aureliano Segundo had survived the danger.</t4378> <t4379>Indeed, Aureliano Segundo recovered in less than a week and within two weeks, he celebrated his escape from death with unprecedented festivities and banquets.</t4379> <t4380>He was still staying at Cotes's house, but he checked on Fernanda every day and even occasionally sat at the table with the household.</t4380> <t4381>Fate had turned his life upside down, making him the husband of his mistress and the lover of his wife.</t4381>
<t4382>This period became a time of rest and change for Fernanda.</t4382> <t4383>After her husband left her, the only things that kept her occupied amid the boredom brought by loneliness were the piano lessons during the afternoon nap hours and the letters from her children.</t4383> <t4384>In the letters that Fernanda wrote to the children every two weeks, resembling detailed news bulletins, there was not a single word that wasn't a lie.</t4384> <t4385>She hid her troubles from the children.</t4385> <t4386>Despite the sunlight falling on the begonias, the heavy heat settling at two in the afternoon, the waves of carnival flowing in from the street, the songs, and the laughter, she hid the pains and unhappiness of this house, which with each passing day resembled her own family's gloomy mansion more and more, from the children.</t4386> <t4387>Fernanda's life was spent among three living ghosts and the dead ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendia.</t4387> <t4388>Sometimes, the ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendia would sit in the living room, listening with curious attention while Fernanda played the piano.</t4388> <t4389>Colonel Aureliano Buendia was no different from a shadow.</t4389> <t4390>Since the day he went to propose to Colonel Gerineldo Marquez that they enter an endless war, he had never gone out into the street, and except for going under the chestnut tree to urinate, he couldn't leave his workshop.</t4390> <t4391>He wouldn't let anyone near him.</t4391>
<t4392>He would let the barber, who came only once every three weeks, in and get a shave.</t4392> <t4393>Ursula would bring him food once a day, and the colonel would eat whatever it was.</t4393> <t4394>He was once again making fish with great zeal, just like before.</t4394> <t4395>However, when he heard that people were buying them not as ornaments but as objects of historical value, he decided to stop selling the fish.</t4395> <t4396>One day, he piled up Remedios's dolls, which had been in the bedroom since the day they got married, in the garden and burned them all.</t4396> <t4397>Ursula, who was always on alert, noticed what her son was doing, but she couldn't stop him.</t4397>
<t4398>"You have a heart of stone," he said.</t4398>
<t4399>Colonel, -This has nothing to do with the heart, he replied.</t4399> <t4400>-Moths are filling the room.</t4400>
<t4401>Amaranta was weaving the shroud.</t4401> <t4402>Fernanda could not understand why she sometimes wrote letters to Meme, even sent gifts, and why she did not even want to hear the name of Jose Arcadio.</t4402>
<t4403>Fernanda, to find out why this was the case, asked Ursula to intervene and inquire.</t4403> <t4404>Amaranta said, "They will die without ever learning the reason."</t4404> <t4405>These words planted the seeds of a doubt in Fernanda's heart that she could never shake off.</t4405> <t4406>Amaranta, tall, broad-shouldered, proud, always wearing lacy, voluminous petticoats, and resisting the weight of years and bad memories, seemed to have a mark of virginity drawn with ash on her forehead.</t4406>
<t4407>In fact, she carried this sign of virginity in the bandage on her arm, which she never took off even at night, washed herself, and ironed herself.</t4407> <t4408>She had dedicated all her days to weaving the shroud cloth.</t4408> <t4409>You would think that during the day she wove until evening, and out of fear that her weaving would be finished, she unraveled it from night until morning.</t4409> <t4410>She did this not to forget her loneliness, but on the contrary, to intensify it.</t4410>
<t4411>During the years of abandonment, Fernanda's greatest sorrow was the worry that Meme would come home for her first vacation and not find Aureliano Segundo at home.</t4411> <t4412>Fortunately, Aureliano Segundo's illness put an end to this fear.</t4412>
<t4413>The husband and wife reached an agreement: When Meme arrived, they would do whatever was necessary so that she would still see Aureliano Segundo as a man tied to his home and not notice the unhappiness and pain in the house.</t4413> <t4414>After that, every year Aureliano Segundo started playing the role of an exemplary husband for two months.</t4414> <t4415>He would host parties where only ice cream and cookies were served to the guests instead of alcohol, and the young girl who had returned from school for the holidays would enliven these parties by playing the piano.</t4415>
<t4416>It was already clear at that time that the young girl did not take after her mother at all.</t4416> <t4417>She resembled Amaranta more, in her twelve to fourteen-year-old self, in the days when she did not know what pain was, when her secret passion for Pietro Crespi had not yet turned her heart in the opposite direction, the Amaranta who would set the house on its feet by dancing.</t4417>
<t4418>The aspect that set Amaranta apart from the other family members was that she had not been engulfed by the family's destiny of solitude.</t4418> <t4419>Meme seemed to be keeping up with the ways of the world.</t4419> <t4420>Even when she shut herself in the living room to practice piano at two o'clock every day without deviating from her strict principles, she was not disconnected from the world...</t4420> <t4421>It was clear that she loved the house, spending the entire year dreaming of the excitement and joy her return from school would bring to the young ones, and that she had inherited her father's excessive hospitality and love for entertainment.</t4421> <t4422>The first sign of these dangerous traits inherited from her father was when, without prior notice, she brought along four nuns and sixty-eight classmates to spend a week with them during the third summer.</t4422>
<t4423>Fernanda was lamenting, "What a terrible thing!"</t4423> <t4424>"This child is a barbarian just like his father!"</t4424>
<t4425>To accommodate so many people, it was necessary to borrow beds and hammocks from neighbors, set the table nine times for each meal, schedule bath times, and borrow forty stools from here and there so that girls in blue uniforms with buttons wouldn't play musical chairs all day trying to find a place to sit.</t4425> <t4426>This vacation was nothing like what they had imagined.</t4426> <t4427>Because as the lively young girls were finishing their breakfast shift, they had to get in line for lunch, and as soon as the last group finished lunch, the first group was already sitting down for dinner.</t4427> <t4428>Throughout the entire week, they only had the chance to tour the farm and facilities once.</t4428> <t4429>By evening, the nuns were exhausted, unable to move, and couldn't even muster the energy to tell the girls what to do or not to do.</t4429>
<t4430>The tireless youngsters were playing in the garden, singing school songs with discordant voices.</t4430> <t4431>One day, they almost trampled Ursula, who was trying to be useful but was more of a hindrance.</t4431>
<t4432>One day, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, without caring that the girls were in the garden, urinated under the chestnut tree, causing the nuns to nearly lose their minds.</t4432> <t4433>On one occasion, Amaranta almost caused a panic.</t4433> <t4434>As she was about to add salt to the soup in the kitchen, one of the nuns came and asked, just for the sake of conversation, what that handful of white powder was.</t4434>
<t4435>Amaranta, -Arsenic, she said.</t4435>
<t4436>The students kept moving to the bathroom on their first night.</t4436> <t4437>They wanted to use the bathroom before going to bed.</t4437> <t4438>Even though it was one in the morning, the line at the girls' bathroom door seemed endless.</t4438> <t4439>As a result, Fernanda bought seventy-two chamber pots.</t4439> <t4440>But by doing so, she only transferred the night problem to the morning.</t4440> <t4441>Because this time, the girls were lining up at dawn with their chamber pots in hand, waiting for their turn to empty and wash them.</t4441> <t4442>Despite some of them suffering from malaria and others being bothered by mosquito bites, most of the girls endured the harshest conditions with unyielding resilience, wandering around the garden even during the hottest hours of the day.</t4442> <t4443>Eventually, they left.</t4443> <t4444>The flowers in the garden were crushed and broken, the furniture in the house was damaged, and drawings and writings were scribbled on the walls.</t4444> <t4445>But Fernanda was so relieved that the girls had left that she overlooked all the damage they had caused.</t4445>
<t4446>He returned the beds and stools they had borrowed from the neighbors.</t4446> <t4447>He also moved seventy-two chairs into Melquiades' room.</t4447> <t4448>The locked room, which had once been the center of the house's spiritual life, began to be referred to as the 'prison room' from then on.</t4448> <t4449>Colonel Aureliano Buendia found this name quite fitting.</t4449> <t4450>Because while the other members of the family were constantly amazed that Melquiades' room never gathered dust and that nothing in there ever aged, the colonel saw the room as a heap of manure.</t4450> <t4451>Moreover, whether it was one way or another, it didn't matter to the colonel; he didn't care which side was right.</t4451>
<t4452>If Fernanda hadn't disturbed him by passing in front of the workshop all day long saying she would carry the chairs, the colonel wouldn't even have known that the room had turned into a chair room.</t4452>
<t4453>In those days, Jose Arcadio Segundo came back home.</t4453> <t4454>Without greeting anyone, he passed through the veranda and went into the workshop to talk to the colonel.</t4454> <t4455>Even though Ursula couldn't see him, she recognized him by the clatter of his studded foreman boots and was astonished by the vastness of the unbridgeable chasm that separated him from the family.</t4455>
<t4456>Jose Arcadio Segundo was so estranged from his twin brother, with whom he used to play deception games by switching places during their childhood, that now they had nothing in common.</t4456> <t4457>There were deep lines on his thin face.</t4457> <t4458>He was serious and thoughtful.</t4458> <t4459>He had a melancholic air typical of Arabs and an autumnal hue on his face.</t4459> <t4460>He was the one who most resembled his mother, Santa Sofia de la Piedad.</t4460> <t4461>Ursula felt resentful towards herself for forgetting about Jose Arcadio Segundo when talking about the family.</t4461> <t4462>But when she started to hear Jose Arcadio Segundo in the house again and realized that the colonel allowed him to enter the workshop during his working hours, Ursula revisited her old memories and became even more convinced that the two brothers had switched places during their childhood.</t4462>
<t4463>Because the one who should bear the name Aureliano was this one, not the other.</t4463> <t4464>No one knew anything about the details of his life.</t4464> <t4465>It was understood that he had no fixed home, organized cockfights at Pilar Ternera's house, stayed there occasionally, but spent most of his nights in the rooms of French prostitutes.</t4465> <t4466>Without showing affection to anyone, without being attached to anyone, without longing or desire for anything, he wandered around like a star in Ursula's planetary system.</t4466>
<t4467>Actually, Jose Arcadio Segundo was not one of the family.</t4467> <t4468>Since the day Colonel Gerineldo Marquez took him at dawn to the barracks, Jose Arcadio Segundo had been estranged from his family.</t4468> <t4469>The Colonel had taken him there not to witness the execution of a death sentence, but so that he would never forget the pitiful and somewhat mocking smile of the man being executed.</t4469> <t4470>That execution was not only Jose Arcadio Segundo's oldest memory, but the only memory from his childhood.</t4470> <t4471>There was another memory.</t4471> <t4472>He couldn't place in which part of his life the memory of the old man who wore an old-fashioned vest, put on a hat resembling a crow's wing, and sat by the window telling him incredible things belonged.</t4472> <t4473>It was a vague memory.</t4473> <t4474>It was a memory loaded with teachings and aspirations, the exact opposite of the memory of the executed man, and it became clearer as he aged.</t4474> <t4475>This vague memory had given true direction to his life, and as time passed, it seemed as if he could almost grasp it.</t4475> <t4476>Ursula asked for Jose Arcadio Segundo's help to dissuade Colonel Aureliano Buendia from locking himself in the workshop.</t4476>
<t4477>-Take him to the cinema.</t4477> <t4478>Even if he doesn't like the movie, at least he will get some fresh air, she said.</t4478> <t4479>However, Ursula soon realized that Jose Arcadio Segundo was as indifferent to her requests as the colonel, and that both men were shielded by an armor impervious to love.</t4479> <t4480>Neither others nor Ursula knew what they talked about for hours when they shut themselves in the workshop, but Ursula sensed that, within the large family, there was no one else bound by kinship as closely as these two.</t4480>
<t4481>To tell the truth, even Jose Arcadio Segundo couldn't get the colonel out of the room he had locked himself in.</t4481> <t4482>The arrival of Meme's classmates had further narrowed the colonel's patience.</t4482> <t4483>Even though Remedios' appetizing babies were burned and disposed of, the colonel set up a hammock in the workshop, using the excuse that the bridal chamber was still not cleaned of moths.</t4483> <t4484>After that, he only went outside to the garden to meet his natural needs and never went out otherwise.</t4484> <t4485>Ursula tried to talk to him, but she couldn't find an opportunity to discuss even the most trivial matters.</t4485> <t4486>She knew that the colonel would place the tray at one end of the counter without even looking at the plates, and whether the soup thickened or the meat got cold, he didn't care until he finished the fish in his hand.</t4486> <t4487>Since Colonel Gerineldo Marquez did not support that senile war idea, Colonel Aureliano</t4487> <t4488>Buendia was becoming more rigid day by day.</t4488>
<t4489>He imprisoned himself within himself.</t4489> <t4490>Eventually, the household began to consider him as dead.</t4490> <t4491>Until the eleventh of October, no human reaction was observed in the colonel.</t4491> <t4492>On the eleventh of October, however, he went to the street door to watch the circus parade that had come to town.</t4492> <t4493>For Colonel Aureliano Buendia, that day was no different from the days he had spent in recent years.</t4493> <t4494>At five in the morning, the sound of black frogs and crickets by the wall woke him up.</t4494> <t4495>It had been drizzling continuously since Saturday.</t4495> <t4496>It wasn't necessary to hear the sound of raindrops falling on the leaves in the garden to understand that the rain hadn't stopped, because Colonel Aureliano Buendia felt the cold in his bones.</t4496>
<t4497>As usual, he was wrapped in his old wool blanket; he had long cotton underwear on.</t4497> <t4498>He called them 'barbarian underwear' because of their outdated style, but he still wore them because they were comfortable.</t4498> <t4499>He put on his tight pants, but did not button them up, nor did he attach the gold button he always wore on his collar, because he intended to wash.</t4499> <t4500>Then, holding his blanket over his head like a hood, he stroked his mustache and went to the garden to urinate.</t4500>
<t4501>Since there was still a long time before sunrise, Jose Arcadio Buendia had not yet gotten up and was dozing under the rotting palm leaves.</t4501> <t4502>Colonel Aureliano Buendia did not see the ghost of his father, whom he had never seen, that day either, and he did not hear his father complaining about the hot urine splashing on his shoes like streams.</t4502> <t4503>The Colonel postponed washing not because the weather was cold and rainy, but because the fog typical of October had settled in.</t4503> <t4504>As he returned to his workshop, he smelled the wick that Santa Sofia de la Piedad had lit to ignite the gas stove, and he waited in the kitchen for the coffee to boil, intending to take his plain coffee and retreat to his room.</t4504>
<t4505>As she asked every morning, Santa Sofia de la Piedad asked what day it was, and the colonel told her it was Tuesday, October eleventh.</t4505>
<t4506>The colonel, who was lost in the light of the flames illuminating the face of the woman who never seemed to be truly living at any moment of her life, suddenly remembered waking up with a start on an eleventh of October day in the midst of the war, with the premonition that the woman in his arms had died.</t4506> <t4507>The woman had indeed died.</t4507> <t4508>Because she had asked him the date just an hour earlier, the colonel never forgot that date.</t4508>
<t4509>Despite this memory, he couldn't realize to what extent his intuitions had left him this time either.</t4509> <t4510>While waiting for the coffee to boil, he began to think about the woman whose name he never knew and whose face he never saw because she came to his bed in the dark, not with longing but with mere curiosity.</t4510> <t4511>In the void of so many women who had entered his life in the same way, the colonel couldn't remember the woman who cried her heart out at their first meeting and swore an hour before her death that she would love him until she died.</t4511> <t4512>After taking the steaming coffee cup and entering his workshop, he forgot both that woman and the others, and lit the lamp to count the fish he had filled in a tin bucket.</t4512>
<t4513>There were seventeen fish in the bucket.</t4513> <t4514>Since Colonel Aureliano Buendia had given up selling the fish, he made two fish a day, and when the fish accumulated in the bucket reached twenty-five, he melted them all down and started anew.</t4514> <t4515>The Colonel devoted himself to work all morning.</t4515>
<t4516>He was thinking of nothing.</t4516> <t4517>He didn't even notice someone running past the workshop at ten o'clock, saying that they should close the doors before the house got flooded as the rain intensified.</t4517> <t4518>The colonel worked, lost in himself, until Ursula came in with a food tray and turned off the lamp.</t4518>
<t4519>Ursula said, "What kind of rain is this!"</t4519>
<t4520>Colonel, -Yes, we are in October, he replied.</t4520>
<t4521>While saying this, he did not take his eyes off the first of the two fish that belonged to that day, which he was preparing on the table.</t4521> <t4522>Because he was placing tiny rubies into the eye sockets of the fish.</t4522> <t4523>After finishing the fish and putting it into the bucket with the others, he started to drink his soup.</t4523> <t4524>Then he slowly ate the onion steak, rice, and baked bananas on the same plate.</t4524> <t4525>His appetite did not change in the best conditions or the most difficult situations.</t4525> <t4526>After the meal, a heaviness settled over him.</t4526> <t4527>With a thought that could be called a kind of scientific superstition, he neither worked, read, bathed, nor made love during the two-hour digestion period after a meal.</t4527> <t4528>This belief was so deeply rooted that he had postponed military operations several times to avoid causing digestive problems for the soldiers.</t4528>
<t4529>He lay down in his hammock and cleaned the inside of his ear with the tip of his penknife.</t4529> <t4530>Within a few minutes, he fell asleep.</t4530> <t4531>In his dream, he saw himself entering an empty house with white walls.</t4531>
<t4532>It bothered him to be the first person to set foot in the house.</t4532> <t4533>In his dream, he remembered having this dream the night before and that he had been having the same dream occasionally for years.</t4533> <t4534>Even before waking up, he knew that the moment he woke up, he would forget the dream.</t4534> <t4535>Because the characteristic of this dream, which recurred from time to time, was that it was remembered within the dream.</t4535> <t4536>Indeed, a moment later, when the barber knocked on the workshop door, Colonel Aureliano Buendia woke up, thinking he had dozed off for a few seconds and had not dreamed at all.</t4536>
<t4537>Berbere, "Let's leave it for today," he said.</t4537> <t4538>"Come on Friday."</t4538>
<t4539>He had a three-day stubble with patches of gray on his face.</t4539> <t4540>But he found shaving unnecessary.</t4540> <t4541>After all, he would get a haircut on Friday, and then he would do both at the same time.</t4541> <t4542>The sticky sweat that drenched him in the sleep he reluctantly succumbed to had swollen the glands under his armpits.</t4542> <t4543>The sky had cleared, but the sun had not come out.</t4543> <t4544>Colonel Aureliano Buendia burped as the sourness of the soup came up to his mouth, and this burp, as if it were a reflex of his organism, made him immediately throw his blanket over his shoulder and head to the bathroom.</t4544>
<t4545>He stayed in the bathroom longer than necessary, sitting until he remembered he needed to get back to work, squatting over the sour, foul smell coming from the wooden box.</t4545> <t4546>While he was dawdling in the bathroom, he remembered again that it was Tuesday and thought that Jose Arcadio Segundo hadn't come because it was the day for the weekly distribution at the banana company.</t4546> <t4547>Remembering these things, as always in recent years, unconsciously led him to think about the war.</t4547> <t4548>He recalled that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had once promised to find him a horse with a white blaze on its forehead, and never brought up the subject again.</t4548> <t4549>Then fragmented memories came to his mind.</t4549> <t4550>He was thinking about them without making any judgments.</t4550> <t4551>Because since he had no room to think about anything else, he had learned to think rigidly so that the inevitable memories wouldn't touch his emotions.</t4551>
<t4552>When he saw that the weather was starting to clear up as he returned to his workshop, he thought it was the perfect time to take a bath.</t4552> <t4553>However, Amaranta had acted before him and had already entered the bathroom.</t4553> <t4554>So, Colonel Aureliano Buendia began making his second fish of the day.</t4554> <t4555>Just as he was about to attach the tail to the fish, the sun suddenly came out so intensely that the light creaked like a fishing boat.</t4555> <t4556>The air, which had been washed and cleansed by three days of rain, suddenly filled with winged ants.</t4556> <t4557>The Colonel remembered that he needed to pee and had held it in until he finished the fish.</t4557> <t4558>When he heard the distant sounds of trumpets, drums, and children's shouts, he went out to the garden at ten past four and, for the first time since his youth, he deliberately allowed himself to be overwhelmed by a sense of longing, reliving the day his father took him to the gypsies' tent to see ice.</t4558>
<t4559>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who heard the sounds, left her work in the kitchen and ran to the door.</t4559>
<t4560>"The circus is here!" he shouted.</t4560>
<t4561>Colonel Aureliano Buendia, instead of going to the chestnut tree to urinate, went to the street door and joined those watching the parade.</t4561> <t4562>He saw a woman dressed in golden gilded clothes, sitting on the head of an elephant.</t4562> <t4563>He saw a camel with a bent neck.</t4563> <t4564>He saw a bear dressed like Dutch girls, keeping rhythm by hitting a ladle against a pot.</t4564> <t4565>He saw jesters walking at the end of the parade, doing somersaults.</t4565> <t4566>After everything had passed and there was nothing left in sight but winged ants and a few people standing there not knowing what to do in the sun-scorched street, the colonel once again faced his miserable loneliness.</t4566> <t4567>Then, thinking about the circus, he went to the chestnut tree.</t4567>
<t4568>While doing his work, he tried to think about the circus again, but the memories no longer came back.</t4568> <t4569>He tucked his head between his shoulders like a chick and rested his forehead against the trunk of the chestnut tree.</t4569> <t4570>The household did not find the colonel until eleven o'clock the next morning, when Santa Sofia de la Piedad went out to the backyard to dump the trash and saw the vultures swarming over the tree.</t4570>
<t4571>Meme's last school holidays coincided with the period of mourning for Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t4571> <t4572>The house, with its tightly closed shutters, was not at all a suitable place for a party.</t4572>
<t4573>Everyone spoke in whispers, ate their meals quietly, and prayed three times a day.</t4573> <t4574>Even the piano practice sessions held during nap hours had an atmosphere reminiscent of a funeral march.</t4574> <t4575>Despite harboring a deep-seated animosity towards the Colonel, it was Fernanda who showed the greatest care in observing the mourning.</t4575>
<t4576>The memorial ceremonies organized by the government upon the death of its arch-enemy, the grand funeral, and the respect and importance shown in memory of the colonel had deeply affected Fernanda.</t4576>
<t4577>Aureliano Segundo, as usual, stayed at home during his daughter's vacation.</t4577>
<t4578>In the meantime, Fernanda must have done something to regain the privilege of being his legal wife, because when Meme came the following year, she saw that she had a sister.</t4578> <t4579>Despite her mother's resistance, the newborn baby was named Amaranta Ursula.</t4579>
<t4580>Meme had graduated from school.</t4580> <t4581>The extent to which she deserved the diploma certifying her as a concert pianist was proven by her masterful interpretation of popular seventeenth-century melodies, performed at the ceremony held to mark the completion of her studies.</t4581> <t4582>With this ceremony, the mourning period also came to an end.</t4582> <t4583>The guests were more impressed by the duality in her personality than by her art.</t4583> <t4584>This young girl, who liked to laugh and have fun and had a childish demeanor, was thought to be incapable of doing serious work.</t4584> <t4585>However, when she sat at the piano, Meme became a completely different girl.</t4585> <t4586>She suddenly seemed to have matured and grown up.</t4586> <t4587>But, Meme was always like this.</t4587> <t4588>In fact, she had neither great enthusiasm nor talent.</t4588> <t4589>She had subjected herself to strict discipline, worked very hard, and achieved the highest grades solely to avoid upsetting her mother.</t4589>
<t4590>If they had trained him in another field, the result would have been the same.</t4590> <t4591>Since her childhood, Meme had suffered greatly from Fernanda's strictness and her decisions based on the principle of all or nothing.</t4591> <t4592>For this reason, just to avoid her mother's wrath, she could endure sacrifices much greater than piano lessons.</t4592> <t4593>She thought that the gilded, Gothic-lettered paper handed to her at the diploma ceremony would free her from the unpleasant compromise she had submitted to, not so much to fulfill her family's wishes, but to avoid trouble, and she believed that once she received her diploma, even the stubborn Fernanda would forget about this old model piano that even the nuns considered a museum piece.</t4593> <t4594>For a few years after finishing school, she thought she was mistaken in this belief.</t4594> <t4595>Because not only at home but also at all charity events, school ceremonies, and all national holidays celebrated in Macondo, where she put half the town to sleep out of boredom, her mother never tired of inviting every new stranger she thought could appreciate her daughter's talents to the house.</t4595>
<t4596>Meme, however, was only able to lock the piano and throw the key into the bottom of a drawer after Amaranta died and the house was once again shrouded in mourning.</t4596> <t4597>Fernanda no longer got upset when she learned who had destroyed the key and when.</t4597> <t4598>Meme had endured these musical performances, organized to showcase her talent, as if she were enduring her lessons, with a sense of suffering.</t4598> <t4599>This was the price of her freedom.</t4599>
<t4600>Fernanda was so pleased with Meme's docility, and so proud of the admiration her art evoked, that she did not object to Meme filling the house with her friends, going to the grove in the afternoons, or attending movies approved by Father Antonio Isabel, accompanied by Aureliano Segundo or a trustworthy neighbor woman.</t4600> <t4601>Meme's true tastes and real inclinations emerged during these moments of freedom.</t4601> <t4602>The young girl found happiness at the opposite extreme of discipline, reveling in noisy parties, love gossip, secretly smoking with her girlfriends for hours, and talking about boys.</t4602> <t4603>One day, during one of these gatherings, they got hold of some sugarcane liquor and, once drunk, stripped naked to compare their bodies, measuring their breasts, waists, and hips.</t4603> <t4604>Meme would never forget the evening she came home chewing mint pastilles to mask the smell of alcohol.</t4604>
<t4605>Fernanda and Amaranta were sitting at the table, eating without speaking to each other.</t4605> <t4606>Meme sat down at the table without noticing the astonishment and sadness on their faces.</t4606> <t4607>In a friend's bedroom for two hours, tears streaming from her eyes</t4607>
<t4608>he had laughed, cried in fear, and finally mustered enough courage to run away from school and tell his mother that it would be best to use the piano as firewood.</t4608> <t4609>He sat down at the table and, while drinking the chicken broth that felt like a lifesaver, saw Fernanda and Amaranta enveloped in an accusatory aura of truth.</t4609>
<t4610>He struggled to keep himself from pointing out their empty arrogance, soullessness, and obsession with grandeur to their faces.</t4610> <t4611>Since coming for the second vacation, Meme knew that her father stayed at home only to save appearances.</t4611>
<t4612>After getting to know Fernanda well and secretly meeting and talking with Petra Cotes, she agreed with her father.</t4612> <t4613>In fact, she would have preferred to be the daughter of her father's mistress rather than her mother.</t4613> <t4614>Meme thought about the chaos that would ensue if she were to say what was on her mind in the haze of alcohol at that moment.</t4614> <t4615>Thinking about this mischief gave Meme such intense satisfaction that it did not go unnoticed by Fernanda.</t4615>
<t4616>"What's up?" he asked.</t4616>
<t4617>Meme said, "There is nothing."</t4617> <t4618>"I was thinking about how much I love both of you."</t4618>
<t4619>Amaranta shuddered when she sensed the obvious hatred in Meme's words.</t4619> <t4620>However, Fernanda was deeply moved by these words, and when Meme woke up at midnight with a splitting headache and began to vomit bile as if she were choking, her mother went mad with worry.</t4620> <t4621>She immediately gave her daughter castor oil.</t4621> <t4622>She applied water to her stomach, ice to her head, and kept her in bed for five days, following the diet prescribed by the newly arrived French doctor.</t4622>
<t4623>The doctor had examined her for more than two hours, and in the end, unable to determine what it was, he dismissed it by saying it was a disease specific to women.</t4623> <t4624>Meme had lost her courage, her morale was broken, and she had no choice but to endure the doctor's advice.</t4624> <t4625>At that time, Ursula, who had become completely blind but had not lost her mobility and thinking ability, was the only person who found the real cause of the illness.</t4625>
<t4626>-I think, this is something that happens to drunkards, he thought.</t4626>
<t4627>Not only did he push this thought away from his mind, but he also felt resentful towards himself for even thinking such a thing.</t4627> <t4628>When Aureliano Segundo saw Meme's condition, he felt a pang of guilt and decided to pay more attention to his daughter from then on.</t4628> <t4629>The joyful friendship between father and daughter, which saved Aureliano Segundo from the painful loneliness of the parties he organized alone and from Fernanda's supervision without leading to an inevitable family tragedy, began after that incident.</t4629> <t4630>Aureliano Segundo was canceling his appointments to be with Meme, taking her to the cinema or the circus, and spending most of his free time with her.</t4630> <t4631>His gluttony, which had caused him to become so fat that he couldn't tie his shoes, had begun to tarnish his cheerful personality.</t4631> <t4632>Finding his daughter restored his former liveliness and joy.</t4632> <t4633>The pleasure he derived from being with his daughter gradually started to pull him out of his disarray.</t4633> <t4634>Meme was living the brightest period of her young womanhood.</t4634>
<t4635>Just like Amaranta, Meme was not beautiful.</t4635> <t4636>But she was cute and good-natured.</t4636>
<t4637>He knew how to make a positive impression on the people he met right from the start.</t4637> <t4638>Meme had a modern spirit that was very touching and quite contrary to Fernanda's antiquated dignity and the heart she tried to hide her misery in.</t4638> <t4639>Aureliano Segundo, on the other hand, was trying to develop this aspect of his daughter.</t4639> <t4640>It was also Aureliano Segundo who decided that Meme should leave the room she had slept in since childhood, filled with statues of saints that frightened even his daughter with their fearful eyes.</t4640> <t4641>He furnished a new bedroom for his daughter.</t4641> <t4642>He bought a large bed, a big dressing table, hung velvet curtains, and while doing so, he didn't realize that he was creating a replica of Petra Cotes's room.</t4642>
<t4643>He was so generous towards his daughter that he didn't even know how much money he gave to Meme.</t4643> <t4644>Because whenever the girl asked for money, she would reach into her father's pocket and take as much as she wanted.</t4644> <t4645>Aureliano Segundo made sure not to deprive his daughter of the new beauty products that arrived at the Banana Company's store.</t4645> <t4646>Meme's room was filled with nail polishes, curling irons, toothbrushes, drops to make her eyes look dreamy, and all kinds of new makeup and beauty products.</t4646> <t4647>Every time Fernanda entered the room, she would lose her mind thinking that her daughter's vanity table looked like that of a French courtesan.</t4647>
<t4648>Well, in those days, Fernanda was spending all her time dealing with Amaranta Ursula, a mischievous and unhealthy child, and writing letters to invisible doctors seeking advice about her little daughter's health.</t4648>
<t4649>When he saw that the father and daughter were inseparable, all he could do was to extract a promise from Aureliano Segundo that he would not take his daughter to Petra Cotes' house.</t4649> <t4650>This was a meaningless and unnecessary request.</t4650> <t4651>Because Aureliano Segundo's mistress was so disturbed and irritated by the friendship between her lover and the girl that she did not even want to hear the girl's name mentioned.</t4651>
<t4652>Petra was seized by an inexplicable fear.</t4652> <t4653>It seemed to her as if Meme would accomplish what Fernanda could not, depriving her of the love she thought would last until death.</t4653> <t4654>For the first time, Aureliano Segundo tolerated his mistress's outbursts and shouting.</t4654> <t4655>He even feared that the traveling trunks would once again be on the road to his wife's house.</t4655> <t4656>Fortunately, that did not happen.</t4656> <t4657>No one could know anyone as Petra Cotes knew her lover, and Petra Cotes knew that if she sent the trunks, they would stay wherever they were sent.</t4657>
<t4658>Because the thing Aureliano Segundo hated the most was disrupting his life due to changes.</t4658> <t4659>The chests remained in their places.</t4659> <t4660>Petra Cotes began sharpening weapons that her daughter couldn't use in order to win back her man.</t4660> <t4661>This was an unnecessary effort; because Meme had no intention of meddling in her father's affairs, and even if she did, she would undoubtedly side with her father's mistress, not her mother.</t4661> <t4662>Meme had no time to deal with anyone.</t4662>
<t4663>As the nuns taught, she swept her room herself and made her own bed.</t4663> <t4664>In the mornings, she would sit on the veranda and sew her own clothes on Amaranta's old pedal machine.</t4664>
<t4665>While the others took their afternoon nap, he practiced the piano for two hours.</t4665>
<t4666>He knew that this daily sacrifice would keep Fernanda's mouth shut.</t4666> <t4667>Although the calls for her to give concerts were becoming less frequent, she still played the piano at church benefits and school meetings to keep her mother's mouth shut.</t4667>
<t4668>In the late afternoon, she would tidy herself up, put on a simple outfit, wear her high-heeled shoes, and if she wasn't going somewhere with her father, she would go to one of her girlfriends' places and stay there until dinner time.</t4668> <t4669>After dinner, it was quite rare for Aureliano Segundo not to take her to the cinema.</t4669>
<t4670>Among Meme's friends, there were three American girls who overcame the electric chicken wire barrier and made friends with the girls from Macondo.</t4670>
<t4671>One of them was Patricia Brown.</t4671> <t4672>Mr. Brown, who gratefully accepted the hospitality shown to him by Aureliano Segundo, opened the doors of his house to Meme and invited her to the Saturday dances.</t4672>
<t4673>The only place where the locals gathered and mingled was these dance meetings.</t4673> <t4674>When Fernanda learned this, she forgot about Amaranta Ursula and the invisible doctors for a moment and started to live a melodrama.</t4674> <t4675>To Meme,</t4675>
<t4676>"Imagine what the Colonel might be thinking in his grave," he said.</t4676> <t4677>Of course, he wanted Ursula to support him in this matter as well.</t4677> <t4678>However, the old, blind woman, contrary to what everyone thought, said that as long as Meme didn't lose her manners and didn't accept Protestantism, there was no harm in her going to dances and befriending American girls her age.</t4678>
<t4679>Meme understood very well what her great-grandmother thought and would get up earlier than ever and rush to church the mornings after she went to the dance.</t4679>
<t4680>Fernanda's opposition continued.</t4680> <t4681>However, one day, when Meme informed her that the Americans wanted her to play the piano, Fernanda gave up resisting.</t4681> <t4682>The piano was taken out of the house.</t4682> <t4683>It was moved to Mister Brown's house.</t4683>
<t4684>The young concert artist received great applause at the concert she gave at Mister Brown's house.</t4684> <t4685>The guests warmly congratulated the young girl.</t4685> <t4686>From that day on, Meme started being invited to parties held at the swimming pool on Sundays, in addition to the Saturday dances, and to a weekly dinner.</t4686> <t4687>Meme learned to swim like professional swimmers, play tennis, and eat Virginia-style pineapple ham.</t4687>
<t4688>Between dancing, swimming, and tennis, Meme suddenly realized that she had started to speak English, albeit imperfectly.</t4688> <t4689>Aureliano Segundo was very pleased with this development in his daughter and bought a six-volume English encyclopedia filled with colorful pictures from a traveling salesman.</t4689>
<t4690>Meme never put down the encyclopedia in her free time.</t4690> <t4691>She stopped sitting with her girlfriends and talking about boys as she used to, gave up the experiments she did with the girls, and devoted all the time she had allocated to them to reading.</t4691> <t4692>There was no pressure for her to do so, but she no longer enjoyed talking about the secret things everyone already knew.</t4692> <t4693>She had started to see the day they drank as a childish adventure.</t4693> <t4694>This event seemed so ridiculous to her that she couldn't help but tell Aureliano Segundo.</t4694> <t4695>Aureliano Segundo found it even more ridiculous and amusing than his daughter had thought.</t4695> <t4696>Laughing so hard he doubled over, as he did whenever he talked about something related to his daughter, he said, "Your mother should hear this."</t4696> <t4697>He made her promise that she would confide in him about her first love with the same sense of trust, and Meme said she liked a red-haired American boy who had come to spend his vacation with the family.</t4697> <t4698>Aureliano Segundo burst into laughter and said, "If your mother heard this."</t4698>
<t4699>Ama Meme also said that the young man had gone to his country and never returned.</t4699> <t4700>The maturity in Meme's decisions was preserving the family's harmony.</t4700> <t4701>After that, Aureliano Segundo started to spend more time with Petra Cotes.</t4701>
<t4702>Even though both his spirit and body had reached a state where they could no longer handle the old excesses, Aureliano Segundo never missed an opportunity to throw a party.</t4702> <t4703>He even found and brought out his accordion, so old that some of its keys had to be held together with shoelaces.</t4703>
<t4704>At home, Amaranta was weaving the endless shroud, and Ursula was wandering in her dark world where nothing but the ghost of Jose Arcadio Buendia under the chestnut tree could be seen.</t4704> <t4705>Fernanda was the only one who had a say at home.</t4705> <t4706>She no longer needed to fill the letters she wrote to her son Jose Arcadio every month with lies.</t4706> <t4707>The only thing she kept from her son was that the invisible doctors had found a tumor in her through correspondence and were preparing to remove it with a telepathic surgery.</t4707>
<t4708>If it weren't for Amaranta's unexpected death, it could be said that peace and happiness reigned for a long time in the weary house of the Buendias.</t4708> <t4709>However, Amaranta's death led to new chaos.</t4709> <t4710>Because it was an entirely unexpected event.</t4710> <t4711>Despite aging and distancing herself from everyone, Amaranta was still vigorous and upright.</t4711> <t4712>She appeared as solid as a rock.</t4712> <t4713>Since the day she last rejected Colonel Gerineldo Marquez and locked herself in her room to cry, no one knew what Amaranta was thinking.</t4713> <t4714>Neither when Beautiful Remedios ascended to heaven, nor when the Aurelianos were killed, nor even at the death of Colonel Aureliano Buendia, the person she loved most in this world, was Amaranta seen crying.</t4714> <t4715>The love she felt for the Colonel was only revealed when they found his corpse under the chestnut tree.</t4715> <t4716>Amaranta helped lift and carry the body.</t4716> <t4717>She dressed him in his uniform, shaved his beard with her own hand, combed his hair, and oiled his mustache more meticulously than in his brightest days.</t4717>
<t4718>Because they knew how accustomed Amaranta was to funeral ceremonies, no one understood that what she did was a demonstration of her love.</t4718> <t4719>Fernanda complained that she did not understand Catholicism, saying that for Amaranta, religion had no connection with life, and she saw Catholicism, all its customs, all its ceremonies as something developed around death, existing solely to continue funeral ceremonies.</t4719>
<t4720>Amaranta was too buried in her memories to understand these hints.</t4720>
<t4721>She had grown old without fulfilling any of her longings.</t4721> <t4722>Her longings remained just as they were.</t4722> <t4723>Whenever she heard Pietro Crespi's waltzes, she wanted to cry like she did in her youth, as if the years she had lived and the painful lessons she had learned meant nothing.</t4723> <t4724>The music tapes that she had thrown away with her own hands, using the excuse that they had rotted from the damp, continued to play and spin in her head.</t4724> <t4725>Amaranta had tried to bury these music tapes in the mire of her passionate relationship with her nephew Aureliano Jose; she had wanted to take refuge under the dignified and manly wing of Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, but she could never overcome the tapes.</t4725>
<t4726>As the most desperate and hopeless act of her old age, she had undertaken to bathe Jose Arcadio.</t4726> <t4727>Three years before the young man went to the theology faculty, Amaranta was undressing and bathing him, caressing him not like a grandmother caresses her grandson, but like a woman caresses a man, as much as she had heard about how French courtesans did it, and squeezing him here and there as she had wanted to do when she watched Pietro Crespi dancing to the metronome in his tight dance pants when she was twelve or fourteen years old.</t4727>
<t4728>However, these did not help either, and Amaranta could not get Pietro Crespi's waltzes out of her mind.</t4728> <t4729>Being caught up in this great passion sometimes saddened Amaranta, and sometimes made her so angry that she would prick her hand with a needle.</t4729> <t4730>But what hurt her the most, what made her the angriest, what devastated her the most was the love that resembled those heavy-scented and worm-infested guava groves that drove her to death.</t4730> <t4731>Just as Colonel Aureliano Buendia could think of nothing but his wars, Amaranta could not get Rebeca out of her mind.</t4731> <t4732>However, despite her brother's success in freezing and rendering harmless his memories, Amaranta was making her own memories increasingly more wounding and destructive.</t4732> <t4733>For years, the only thing she asked of God was not to take her life before Rebeca's.</t4733> <t4734>Every time she passed by Rebeca's house, seeing it collapse a little more, she felt at ease, thinking God was granting her wish.</t4734>
<t4735>One day, while sewing on the veranda, she suddenly had a premonition that, while she was sitting in the same place, in the same light, they would bring the news of Rebeca's death.</t4735> <t4736>And just like waiting for a letter, she sat down and began to wait for this news.</t4736> <t4737>Sometimes, so that the waiting wouldn't be longer and more sorrowful with idle hands, she would tear off buttons and sew them back on again.</t4737> <t4738>None of the household members realized that Amaranta was meticulously sewing a shroud for Rebeca.</t4738> <t4739>Later, when Aureliano Triste described how he saw Rebeca, how her skin was like leather, how only three strands of yellow hair were left on her head, and how she resembled a ghost in that state, Amaranta was not surprised at all.</t4739>
<t4740>Because what the young man described was no different from the image he had constructed in his own mind.</t4740>
<t4741>He decided to beautify Rebeca's corpse.</t4741> <t4742>He would cover the wrinkles on her face with paraffin and make a wig for her from the hair of saint statues.</t4742>
<t4743>He would reveal a very marvelous corpse with the linen woven shroud.</t4743> <t4744>He would line the inside of the coffin with plush velvet and surround the edges with purple ribbons.</t4744>
<t4745>Then, with a grand funeral ceremony, he would offer the coffin and Rebeca to the wolves as prey.</t4745>
<t4746>He conceived these with such great hatred that he shuddered whenever he thought of his own plots.</t4746> <t4747>If Amaranta had entered such an obsession because of love, she would have devised everything in the same way.</t4747> <t4748>She was preparing all the details of the funeral ceremony perfectly so as not to forget anything in the chaos.</t4748> <t4749>She gradually became an unparalleled expert on funeral ceremonies.</t4749> <t4750>The only thing she forgot in this terrible plan was the possibility that, despite all her prayers, she might die before Rebeca, which indeed happened.</t4750>
<t4751>Ama, Amaranta did not feel any pain.</t4751> <t4752>On the contrary, she died free from all pain and evil because death had given her a privilege by announcing its arrival several years in advance.</t4752> <t4753>Shortly after Meme went to school, one day while sitting on the veranda, Amaranta saw death sitting with her, sewing.</t4753> <t4754>She saw it with her own eyes because death was in the guise of a woman dressed in blue, with long hair, from ancient times.</t4754>
<t4755>It somewhat resembled the days when Pilar Ternera came to help with the kitchen chores.</t4755> <t4756>When Amaranta saw death, Fernanda was there a few times, but she did not see it.</t4756> <t4757>Yet the truth was as tangible as a human being.</t4757> <t4758>Once, she even asked Amaranta to thread her needle.</t4758> <t4759>Death never mentioned to Amaranta when she would die or whether her time would come before Rebeca's.</t4759> <t4760>It only told her to start sewing her shroud on the sixth of April.</t4760> <t4761>It allowed her to work as she wished and to make a beautiful shroud as she desired.</t4761> <t4762>However, it stipulated that she should prepare her own shroud with the same honesty she had shown while weaving Rebeca's shroud, without any procrastination and with meticulous care.</t4762> <t4763>And it said that on the evening of the day she finished the shroud, she would die without any pain, without any fear, and far from all evil.</t4763> <t4764>To prolong the task as much as possible, Amaranta ordered raw linen and spun the thread herself.</t4764>
<t4765>He was doing the thread spinning job with such care that it took four years.</t4765>
<t4766>Then she began to sew.</t4766> <t4767>As the inevitable end approached, she realized that it would only be possible to extend her work beyond Rebeca's death by a miracle.</t4767> <t4768>This thought gave her the composure needed to accept defeat.</t4768> <t4769>It was then that Amaranta understood the reason for the vicious cycle created by Colonel Aureliano Buendía's ornamental fish.</t4769> <t4770>The world now only lingered on Amaranta's skin; her inner self was purified of all evils.</t4770>
<t4771>Amaranta was saddened that she had not grasped this years ago.</t4771> <t4772>Then she could have purified her memories, rebuilt the universe with a new light, recalled the lavender scent of Pietro Crespi in the evenings without shuddering, and could have saved Rebeca from that misery because she knew what loneliness meant, whether she hated or loved her.</t4772>
<t4773>The hatred in Meme's drunken words when she came home that evening did not upset her.</t4773> <t4774>That evening, while looking at Meme, she felt as if she was seeing the vision of another young girl.</t4774> <t4775>She thought that once upon a time, that young girl also seemed as innocent as Meme, yet had long been tainted by feelings of hatred.</t4775> <t4776>When Amaranta realized this, she had accepted her fate so completely that knowing all chances of change and improvement were lost no longer shook her.</t4776>
<t4777>He had no purpose left other than finishing his shroud.</t4777> <t4778>Therefore, he stopped wasting time on unnecessary details as he did in the beginning and sped up the work.</t4778>
<t4779>A week before her death, she calculated that the sewing would be finished on the night of February 4th and, without giving any reason, told Meme to postpone the concert she had planned for the next day.</t4779> <t4780>Meme did not pay attention to her.</t4780> <t4781>As a result, Amaranta looked for ways to extend the work by forty-eight hours.</t4781>
<t4782>When the storm that broke out on the night of February 4 caused damage to the power plant, he thought the solution he was looking for was given by death itself.</t4782> <t4783>However, until that day, the final stitch of the shroud, which was the most beautiful work ever created by a woman in the world, was also completed at eight the next morning, and without taking on a pitiful air, he announced that he would die that evening.</t4783> <t4784>He not only told this to the household but also announced it to the entire town.</t4784> <t4785>Because he believed that he could atone for a life spent in wickedness by doing one last good deed for the world, and he thought the best thing he could do was to deliver the letters of those who did not want to send news to their dead.</t4785>
<t4786>The news that Amaranta Buendía would be taking the mail from the realm of the dead with her to the other world that evening spread throughout Macondo before noon.</t4786> <t4787>By three o'clock in the afternoon, letters were piled high inside the cardboard box in the living room.</t4787> <t4788>Those who did not want to write letters sent messages by word of mouth, and Amaranta noted down the name of the recipient, the date of death, and the message in a notebook.</t4788> <t4789>"Don't worry at all," she said.</t4789> <t4790>"As soon as I get there, my first task will be to find them and deliver your message."</t4790>
<t4791>It was a ridiculous situation.</t4791> <t4792>Amaranta was neither panicking nor upset.</t4792> <t4793>In fact, she was filled with the liveliness and joy that comes from having completed a task.</t4793> <t4794>She was as upright and slender as always.</t4794> <t4795>If her cheeks hadn't sunken and if she hadn't lost a few teeth, she would have looked much younger than she was.</t4795> <t4796>She instructed them to put the letters in a chest, seal it with tar, and place it in her grave in a way that would minimize damage from moisture.</t4796> <t4797>In the morning, she summoned a carpenter.</t4797> <t4798>She stood in the living room as if she were getting a new dress made, and had her measurements taken for her coffin.</t4798> <t4799>In her final hours, she was so lively that Fernanda thought she was mocking everyone.</t4799> <t4800>However, Ursula, who knew well that the Buendías died without suffering, had no doubt that Amaranta was going to die.</t4800> <t4801>But she feared that in the chaos of those who wanted the letters to be sent off as soon as possible, the girl would be buried alive, as this letter business would cause trouble for them.</t4801> <t4802>Therefore, she set about getting rid of those who had crowded into the house.</t4802>
<t4803>Someone was resisting coming out, arguing.</t4803> <t4804>Anyway, at four o'clock, Ursula managed to clear the house.</t4804> <t4805>By that time, Amaranta had finished distributing her belongings to the poor and had left only the clean clothes and slippers she would wear after death on the un-nailed coffin.</t4805> <t4806>She had not forgotten to take this precaution because she remembered how they had to buy new shoes when Colonel Aureliano Buendia died, as he had nothing left but the slippers he wore in his workshop.</t4806> <t4807>As it approached five o'clock, Aureliano Segundo arrived to take Meme to a concert and was surprised to see the house prepared for a funeral.</t4807> <t4808>If there was anyone who seemed like they would never die at that moment, it was Amaranta.</t4808> <t4809>She was sitting and cutting her corns.</t4809> <t4810>Aureliano Segundo and Meme jokingly said their goodbyes to her, promising to hold a big celebration in her honor when she returned to the world the following Saturday, and then left.</t4810> <t4811>Father Antonio Isabel, who had heard that Amaranta Buendia was collecting letters to take to the dead, arrived at five o'clock to perform her last rites and waited more than fifteen minutes for Amaranta to come out of the bathroom.</t4811>
<t4812>When the priest saw Amaranta with her hair falling over her shoulders, appearing in her nightgown, he suspected something was amiss and sent his assistant boy back.</t4812>
<t4813>Since he was already there, he decided to hear Amaranta's confession after twenty years of silence.</t4813> <t4814>Amaranta curtly replied that she did not need any spiritual assistance because her conscience was clear.</t4814> <t4815>Upon hearing this, Fernanda was horrified.</t4815> <t4816>Without caring whether those in the room could hear or not, she wondered what terrible sin Amaranta had committed to prefer going to her death without confession.</t4816>
<t4817>he asked Amaranta if she was.</t4817> <t4818>Upon this, Amaranta lay down and had Ursula confirm in front of everyone that she was a virgin.</t4818>
<t4819>Shouting to make Fernanda hear, "Let's not worry at all," he said,</t4819>
<t4820>Amaranta Buendia leaves this world the same way she came into it.</t4820>
<t4821>He never got up again.</t4821> <t4822>He leaned against the pillows as if he were truly ill.</t4822>
<t4823>She braided her long hair and gathered it over her ears.</t4823>
<t4824>Death had advised her to arrange her hair this way as she entered the coffin.</t4824> <t4825>Then she asked Ursula for a mirror and saw her face for the first time in over forty years.</t4825> <t4826>She was surprised to see how much her face, worn by age and pain, resembled the one she had imagined.</t4826> <t4827>From the silence in the bedroom, Ursula sensed that the day was beginning to darken.</t4827>
<t4828>"Say goodbye to Fernanda," he pleaded with Amaranta.</t4828> <t4829>"A moment of reconciliation is worth more than a lifetime of friendship," he said.</t4829>
<t4830>Amaranta replied, "It won't be of any use anymore."</t4830>
<t4831>At the moment the lights of the fabricated scene were turned on and the second episode of the Meme program began, he couldn't help but think of Amaranta.</t4831>
<t4832>In the middle of the piece, someone whispered the news into his ear and the concert was interrupted.</t4832> <t4833>When Aureliano Segundo arrived home, ugly and pale, with his hand in a black bandage, he had to push through the crowd to see the corpse of the old girl, wrapped in that beautiful shroud.</t4833> <t4834>They had laid Amaranta in the parlor, next to the mailbox.</t4834>
<t4835>After the nine-night mourning held for Amaranta, Ursula never got up again.</t4835> <t4836>Santa Sofia de la Piedad was taking care of her.</t4836>
<t4837>She was taking his meals to his room, carrying his water for washing, and recounting everything that was happening in Macondo.</t4837> <t4838>Aureliano Segundo frequently came to check on Ursula, and each time he brought her something to wear.</t4838> <t4839>Ursula placed these items beside her bed, among the things she needed daily.</t4839> <t4840>In this way, she had created a world within her reach in a short time.</t4840> <t4841>Amaranta Ursula, who resembled her, loved her very much.</t4841> <t4842>Ursula had also taught the child to read and write.</t4842> <t4843>Because she showed no signs of senility and was still capable of taking care of herself, everyone assumed Ursula was bedridden due to the weight of her hundred years, and they accepted this as natural.</t4843> <t4844>Although it was known that she had difficulty seeing, no one considered that she might be completely blind.</t4844>
<t4845>Ursula had so much free time and her inner world was so filled that she could closely observe the lives of those at home.</t4845> <t4846>For this reason, she was the first to understand that Meme had a secret trouble.</t4846>
<t4847>Ursula called Meme over, saying, "Come here, let me see."</t4847>
<t4848>-Look, there's no one here but the two of us.</t4848> <t4849>Come on, tell this poor old man what's bothering you.</t4849>
<t4850>Meme wanted to brush it off with a laugh and avoid talking.</t4850> <t4851>Ursula did not insist, but when Meme stopped coming around, she believed her suspicions were correct.</t4851>
<t4852>She noticed that Meme had started getting up earlier than usual, couldn't stay still until it was time to go out, paced up and down all night in the bedroom next to hers, and was startled even by the flutter of a butterfly's wings.</t4852> <t4853>One day, Meme left the house saying she was going to Aureliano Segundo.</t4853> <t4854>Soon after, Aureliano Segundo came home to look for his daughter.</t4854> <t4855>After this incident, Ursula realized and was surprised at how limited Fernanda's imagination was and her inability to draw conclusions from events.</t4855>
<t4856>It was clear as day that long before the night when Fernanda caught her kissing someone at the cinema and caused an uproar in the house, Meme had been secretly doing something, feeling oppressed and troubled by something she was trying to keep hidden.</t4856>
<t4857>Meme had become so withdrawn at that time that she accused Ursula of betraying her.</t4857> <t4858>In fact, she gave herself away.</t4858> <t4859>Meme had been giving clues for a long time that even the most absent-minded would notice.</t4859> <t4860>However, Fernanda had become so engrossed in her relationship with her invisible doctors that she saw nothing.</t4860> <t4861>In the end, even Fernanda noticed her daughter's long silences, sudden outbursts, inconsistencies, and contradictions.</t4861>
<t4862>She began to observe her daughter secretly, but with unerring meticulousness.</t4862> <t4863>She continued to send her out with her girlfriends as usual, helped her dress when she was going to Saturday parties, and avoided asking any questions that might startle her.</t4863> <t4864>Fernanda had enough evidence in her hands to show that Meme was doing things other than what she said.</t4864> <t4865>Even so, she did not let her daughter sense her suspicions and waited for the right moment.</t4865> <t4866>One night, Meme left the house saying she was going to the cinema with her father.</t4866> <t4867>Soon after, Fernanda saw fireworks being set off from Petra Cotes' house and heard the unmistakable sound of Aureliano Segundo's accordion.</t4867>
<t4868>Then he got dressed, went to the cinema, and spotted his daughter in the darkness of the theater.</t4868>
<t4869>In the shock and sadness caused by this tangible evidence, although she could not see the face of the man Meme was kissing, she could distinguish his voice amidst the deafening noise and laughter of the spectators.</t4869> <t4870>As soon as she heard the man say, "I'm sorry, my love," Fernanda lifted her daughter without a word, humiliated her completely by walking her through the crowded Turkish Street, brought her home, and locked her in her room.</t4870>
<t4871>Fernanda recognized the man who came to see Meme by his voice at six o'clock the next evening.</t4871> <t4872>He was a young man with a pale complexion and dark, melancholic eyes.</t4872> <t4873>Since Fernanda had never seen gypsies, she was surprised when she saw his jet-black eyes.</t4873> <t4874>If there had been another woman in Fernanda's place whose heart was not as hard as hers, she would have understood the young man's romantic demeanor and how he won her daughter's heart.</t4874>
<t4875>He had an old linen garment on his back, shoes on his feet that had become unpatchable from being mended so many times, and a straw hat in his hand that he had bought on Saturday.</t4875>
<t4876>The young man had never been as timid as he was at that moment in his entire life.</t4876> <t4877>Fortunately, he had a dignity and personality that saved him from making a fool of himself, along with a natural grace.</t4877>
<t4878>The only aspect that marred this delicacy was his hands, worn out by hard work, and his neglected nails.</t4878> <t4879>Fernanda realized at first glance that he was a laborer.</t4879> <t4880>She noticed that the young man was wearing the clothes he wore on Sundays, and that the rashes, considered a mark of those who worked at the Banana Company, were visible under his shirt.</t4880>
<t4881>He didn't give the young man a chance to open his mouth.</t4881> <t4882>He didn't even let him step inside from the threshold.</t4882> <t4883>"Go away from here," he said.</t4883> <t4884>"You have no right to disturb decent people."</t4884> <t4885>Then, because the yellow butterflies at the door were coming into the house, he slammed the door in the young man's face.</t4885>
<t4886>The young man's name was Mauricio Babilonia.</t4886> <t4887>He was born and raised in Macondo.</t4887> <t4888>He was the assistant foreman in the Banana Company's garage.</t4888> <t4889>Meme had met the young man when she went to the garage to get the car to go for a walk in the grove with Patricia Brown one day.</t4889> <t4890>Because the driver was sick, they had taken him along to drive the car.</t4890> <t4891>Meme had finally been able to do what she had wanted for a long time, sitting next to the driver and watching how he drove the car.</t4891> <t4892>Mauricio Babilonia, doing what the regular driver did not, had given Meme practical driving lessons.</t4892> <t4893>This event had occurred around the time Meme started visiting the Browns' house frequently.</t4893> <t4894>Back then, women driving cars was not well accepted.</t4894> <t4895>Therefore, Meme had to be content with the technical knowledge she had acquired and had not seen Mauricio Babilonia for a few months.</t4895> <t4896>She remembered much later that during the car ride, aside from the neglect of his hands, the young man's masculine beauty had caught her attention.</t4896>
<t4897>However, when they got out of the car, Meme told Patricia Brown that she was annoyed by the young man's confident demeanor.</t4897> <t4898>On the first Saturday that Meme went to the cinema with her father, she saw Maurice Babilonia again.</t4898> <t4899>He was sitting a few seats away from them, wearing linen clothes.</t4899> <t4900>Meme noticed that the young man wasn't watching the movie; he kept turning around and looking at her.</t4900> <t4901>She was irritated by his rude, disrespectful behavior.</t4901> <t4902>Later, when Mauricio Babilonia came over to ask Aureliano Segundo how he was doing, Meme realized that the young man had known her father since the days he worked at Aureliano Triste's power plant.</t4902> <t4903>The young man stood beside her father with the demeanor of a worker talking to his boss.</t4903> <t4904>When Meme saw this, her anger at the young man's proud attitude vanished.</t4904> <t4905>During a time when they never found themselves alone together and only exchanged greetings, one night Meme dreamed of Mauricio Babilonia.</t4905>
<t4906>In her dream, the ship was sinking and the young man was saving Meme.</t4906> <t4907>She felt as if the man had given her the opportunity she had been waiting for.</t4907> <t4908>Because Meme turned away not only from Mauricio Babilonia but from every man who showed interest in her.</t4908> <t4909>When she woke up, she was so angry that instead of hating the young man, she felt an urge to see him as soon as possible.</t4909> <t4910>This urge intensified more and more throughout the week.</t4910>
<t4911>When they met at the cinema on Saturday night, Meme's heart was about to leap out of her chest.</t4911> <t4912>She was terrified that Mauricio Babilonia would notice her excitement.</t4912> <t4913>With a mix of anger and joy, Meme extended her hand for the first time, and Mauricio</t4913> <t4914>Babilonia shook her hand for the first time.</t4914> <t4915>Although Meme felt a moment of regret, when she saw that the young man's hand was as sweaty and cold from excitement as hers, her regret vanished in an instant, replaced by a sense of satisfaction.</t4915> <t4916>Meme realized that she would not feel at ease until she showed Mauricio Babilonia the futility of harboring an unattainable longing for her, and this urge gnawed at her for a week.</t4916> <t4917>She tried every trick she could think of to persuade Patricia Brown to go get the car, but she failed.</t4917>
<t4918>In the end, she made up her mind to take advantage of the red-haired boy who had come to Macondo again to spend his vacation.</t4918> <t4919>She pretended to have a great interest in cars and said she wanted to see the new models.</t4919> <t4920>The red-haired American then took her to the garage.</t4920> <t4921>As soon as Meme saw Mauricio Babilonia, she started to deceive herself and convinced herself that she couldn't bear the desire to be alone with Mauricio.</t4921> <t4922>When she realized that the young man sensed this as soon as he saw her, she flew into a rage.</t4922>
<t4923>Meme said, "I came to see the new car models."</t4923>
<t4924>Mauricio replied, "A good excuse."</t4924>
<t4925>Meme noticed that the young man was feeling confident and proud, and she tried to do something to humiliate him.</t4925>
<t4926>However, the young man did not give him a chance: "Don't get angry," he whispered.</t4926>
<t4927>-It's not the first time a woman has gone crazy over a man.</t4927> <t4928>Because of the defeat she felt, Meme left the garage without looking at the cars.</t4928> <t4929>All night long, she tossed and turned in her bed, crying out of frustration.</t4929> <t4930>The American red-haired boy who had really started to interest Meme now seemed no different from a baby who wet his bed.</t4930> <t4931>Around that time, whenever Meme saw yellow butterflies, she noticed that she would see Mauricio Babilonia afterwards.</t4931> <t4932>Previously, when she once saw a swarm of yellow butterflies over the garage, she thought they were attracted by the smell of paint.</t4932> <t4933>Once, as she was about to enter the cinema, yellow butterflies fluttered above her head.</t4933> <t4934>But when Mauricio Babilonia started to follow her like a shadow in a way that only Meme could notice in the crowd, she realized that the yellow butterflies were related to the young man.</t4934> <t4935>Wherever Meme went, Mauricio Babilonia would also go.</t4935>
<t4936>At concerts, in cinemas, in church, Mauricio</t4936> <t4937>Babylon would be somewhere in the midst of the absolute crowd, and Meme could understand where he was without seeing him, because almost wherever the young man was, butterflies would not be missing from there.</t4937> <t4938>Once, Aureliano Segundo was so disturbed by the fluttering of the butterflies that Meme almost broke her promise to hide nothing from her father and was about to tell him the situation.</t4938>
<t4939>However, a voice inside told her to stay silent, as her father would just laugh it off as he always did, saying -What would your mother say if she heard?</t4939>
<t4940>One morning, while Fernanda was cutting roses in the garden, she suddenly screamed.</t4940> <t4941>At that moment, Meme, who was standing exactly where Beautiful Remedios had ascended to the sky, heard her mother's scream and ran, leaving the spot where she stood.</t4941> <t4942>Fernanda had suddenly heard the sound of wings and feared that the miracle that had taken Beautiful Remedios would also happen to her own daughter.</t4942> <t4943>But it was the butterflies flapping their wings.</t4943> <t4944>Meme's heart skipped a beat when she saw the butterflies that seemed to have suddenly emerged from the light.</t4944>
<t4945>At that moment, Mauricio Babilonia came with a package in his hand, saying that he brought a gift from Patricia Brown.</t4945> <t4946>Meme tried not to blush or tremble and, smiling as if nothing was wrong, told the young man to leave the package on the railing because her hands were muddy.</t4946>
<t4947>Fernanda looked at the young man whom she would throw out of the house a few months later without recognizing where she knew him from, and the only thing that caught her attention was his pallor.</t4947>
<t4948>"What a strange man," he said.</t4948> <t4949>"You can tell by looking at a person's face that they will die soon."</t4949>
<t4950>Meme thought that her mother was speaking that way because of the butterflies.</t4950> <t4951>After finishing pruning the roses, Meme washed her hands and went up to her room to open the package.</t4951> <t4952>It was a kind of Chinese toy.</t4952> <t4953>It was made of five nested boxes.</t4953> <t4954>Inside the smallest box, there was a piece of paper with scrawled writing that seemed to be from someone who barely knew how to read and write.</t4954> <t4955>On the paper, it said - We'll meet at the cinema on Saturday.</t4955> <t4956>Meme's heart leapt into her throat when she remembered that the package had been sitting on the railing for so long, thinking what if her mother had taken and opened it.</t4956> <t4957>Although she liked Mauricio Babilonia's sincere and bold gesture, she pitied him for being naive enough to think that she would go to this rendezvous.</t4957>
<t4958>He knew that Aureliano Segundo would meet with his friends on Saturday night.</t4958>
<t4959>But after writhing with excitement and curiosity all week, she tricked her father, convincing him to drop her off at the cinema and pick her up once the film was over.</t4959> <t4960>Before the lights went out, a butterfly made its nocturnal flight over Meme's head.</t4960> <t4961>Then it happened.</t4961> <t4962>When the lights went out, Mauricio Babilonia sat next to her.</t4962> <t4963>Meme, struggling in a state of confusion, sensed that this man, whom she could identify in the dark only by the smell of machine oil as she had seen in her dreams, could save her from this quagmire.</t4963>
<t4964>Mauricio said, "If you hadn't come, you would never see me again."</t4964>
<t4965>Meme felt the weight of his hand on her knees and at that moment realized that they were both approaching the brink of surrendering to each other.</t4965>
<t4966>Smiling, "What surprises me the most about you is that you say everything you shouldn't," he said.</t4966>
<t4967>The young man had swept her off her feet.</t4967> <t4968>She could neither sleep nor eat.</t4968> <t4969>She had become so withdrawn that she even got bored being with her father.</t4969> <t4970>She found a thousand excuses to avoid Fernanda, saying she was going elsewhere.</t4970> <t4971>She stopped seeing her girlfriends.</t4971> <t4972>Wherever and whenever it was, to meet Mauricio</t4972> <t4973>Babilonia, she gave up all her habits and disregarded all customs.</t4973> <t4974>At first, the young man's roughness bothered her.</t4974> <t4975>When they were alone for the first time in the empty field behind the garage, Mauricio, without any mercy, had reduced her to an animal state and left her breathless.</t4975> <t4976>It took some time for her to understand that this was a form of love.</t4976> <t4977>After she understood, she lost her mind and began to live only for Mauricio.</t4977> <t4978>The smell of machine oil washed with ash water from the young man drove her crazy, and she couldn't resist the desire to lose herself in that scent.</t4978>
<t4979>Shortly before Amaranta's death, Meme had a moment of clarity and trembled at the uncertainty of the future.</t4979> <t4980>Then, she heard about a woman who read the future by looking at playing cards.</t4980> <t4981>She went to her in secret.</t4981> <t4982>This was Pilar Ternera.</t4982> <t4983>As soon as Pilar saw her, she understood why she had come.</t4983>
<t4984>He said to the girl, Sit down.</t4984> <t4985>I don't need to look at the cards to tell the future of a Buendia.</t4985> <t4986>Meme did not know that this century-old witch was her great-grandmother and she would never know.</t4986> <t4987>After hearing the words of this woman, who had such a bold realism to say that the ailment called love could not be cured anywhere but in bed, Meme would not believe that she was her great-grandmother even if she learned it.</t4987>
<t4988>Mauricio</t4988> <t4989>Babilonia thought like the fortune-teller woman.</t4989> <t4990>However, Meme opposed his view and secretly believed that the judgments of a worker should not be taken seriously.</t4990> <t4991>Meme thought that one aspect of love overpowered the other and destroyed itself.</t4991> <t4992>Because the greatest characteristic of men was to deny hunger after being satisfied.</t4992> <t4993>However, Pilar Ternera not only changed this wrong view, but also offered the girl the canopy bed where she first became pregnant by Meme's grandfather Arcadio, and later by Aureliano Jose.</t4993> <t4994>Sitting in the steam of the mustard poultice, she taught how to avoid an unwanted pregnancy and gave recipes for medicines that would completely erase any guilt if she ever got into trouble.</t4994> <t4995>Pilar Ternera's talk gave Meme a courage similar to the one she felt on the night she was drunk.</t4995> <t4996>However, Amaranta's death postponed her decision.</t4996> <t4997>During the nine-night mourning period, Meme did not leave Mauricio Babilonia's side for a moment amidst the crowd that filled the house.</t4997> <t4998>Then the long-term mourning began, and this forced separation distanced them from each other for a while.</t4998>
<t4999>During these days, Meme felt such an irresistible desire, uncontrollable excitement, and so many urges that had been suppressed until then, that on the first evening she could go out, she went straight to Pilar Ternera's house.</t4999> <t5000>Without any resistance, without shame or hesitation, and without seeing any need for formalities, she gave herself to Mauricio Babilonia.</t5000> <t5001>Her sincerity had brought such agility to her actions and given such skill to her instincts that if there had been a suspicious person in Mauricio's place, they would have thought the girl had been through the mill upon seeing her in this state.</t5001>
<t5002>They met and made love twice a week for more than three months.</t5002> <t5003>Aureliano Segundo, who said that Meme was with him just to save his daughter from her mother's bad temper and suspected nothing, was unknowingly complicit in their affair.</t5003>
<t5004>The night Fernanda caught them at the cinema, Aureliano Segundo, crushed under the weight of his guilt, went to see Meme in the room where her mother had locked her.</t5004> <t5005>He trusted that his daughter would reveal the secrets she needed to share with him.</t5005> <t5006>However, Meme denied everything.</t5006>
<t5007>Seeing the girl's confident demeanor and her introversion, Aureliano Segundo got the impression that there was no bond left between them, that their friendship and complicity were a thing of the past.</t5007>
<t5008>Mauricio</t5008> <t5009>thought about talking to Babilonia.</t5009> <t5010>With the advantage of being his former boss, he was planning to prevent the young man from persisting in this matter.</t5010>
<t5011>However, Petra Cotes convinced him that this was a problem only a woman could solve.</t5011> <t5012>Aureliano Segundo was wavering in indecision.</t5012>
<t5013>He could do nothing but hope that staying away from the young man would put an end to his daughter's troubles.</t5013>
<t5014>Meme was not showing any signs of sorrow.</t5014> <t5015>On the contrary, Ursula, who was lying in the adjacent room, could observe his regular breathing in his sleep, his flawless execution of tasks, his regular eating habits, and his digestive health.</t5015> <t5016>About two months had passed since Meme was confined to the room, and during this time, something had occurred that disturbed Ursula and seemed contrary to her.</t5016>
<t5017>Meme, unlike everyone else, did not bathe in the mornings but at seven in the evenings.</t5017> <t5018>Once, Ursula wanted to warn her, to tell her that there could be a scorpion in the bathroom at that hour.</t5018> <t5019>However, Meme never approached Ursula, thinking that she had betrayed her.</t5019>
<t5020>Thereupon, Ursula also stopped bothering him like a nagging old grandmother.</t5020> <t5021>In the evenings, the house began to be swarmed by yellow butterflies.</t5021> <t5022>Every evening, as Meme returned from her bath, she would see Fernanda, driven mad with desperation, trying to kill the butterflies with insecticide in hand.</t5022> <t5023>Fernanda would say, "This is a terrible thing."</t5023> <t5024>"All my life, I've heard that seeing a butterfly at night is a bad omen."</t5024> <t5025>One night, while Meme was in the bath, Fernanda entered her room and was suffocated by the butterflies filling the room.</t5025> <t5026>She grabbed a piece of cloth to chase away the butterflies, and when she made the connection between the mustard plasters scattered on the floor and her daughter's evening baths, she was frozen with horror.</t5026> <t5027>This time, she did not wait for an opportune moment as she had done the first time.</t5027>
<t5028>The next day, she invited the new mayor to dinner.</t5028> <t5029>Since the mayor, like Fernanda, came from the mountainous region, he was considered her compatriot in a way.</t5029> <t5030>Fernanda asked the mayor to place a guard in the backyard, saying that her chickens were being stolen.</t5030> <t5031>That night Mauricio</t5031> <t5032>Babilonia, as he had been doing for the past few months, while removing the tiles of the bathroom to enter naked and trembling with love among the scorpions and butterflies to reach Meme who was waiting for him, was shot by the guard.</t5032> <t5033>The bullet lodged in his spine confined him to bed for life.</t5033>
<t5034>After growing quite old, without making a sound, without complaining, without betraying his love for even a moment, he died alone among the pain of memories and the ever-restless yellow butterflies.</t5034> <t5035>Everyone had known him as a chicken thief and he had been ostracized by society.</t5035>
<t5036>When they brought Meme Buendia's son home, the events that would deliver the fatal blow to Macondo were just beginning to unfold.</t5036> <t5037>Those were such chaotic days that no one was in a position to deal with family scandals.</t5037> <t5038>Therefore, Fernanda was confident that she could keep the child hidden as if he never existed.</t5038>
<t5039>Since he was in no position to turn the child away when they brought him, he had to take him in, and because he didn't have the courage to drown him in the bathroom's water tank, he had to accept him for the rest of his life, whether he wanted to or not.</t5039> <t5040>He locked the child in Colonel Aureliano Buendia's old workshop.</t5040> <t5041>And he convinced Santa Sofia de la Piedad that he had found the child in a basket floating in the river.</t5041> <t5042>However, Ursula would die without ever learning where the child had come from.</t5042> <t5043>One day, while Fernanda was feeding the baby, Amaranta Ursula, who entered the workshop, also believed the story about the basket floating in the river.</t5043> <t5044>Aureliano Segundo, who had fallen out with his wife due to Meme's foolishness that led to the tragedy, only learned about the existence of his grandson by chance three years after the child was brought home.</t5044> <t5045>That day, the child had dashed out to the veranda, taking advantage of a momentary lapse in Fernanda's attention.</t5045> <t5046>He was completely naked, his hair was like felt, and he had a large sexual organ resembling a turkey's neck.</t5046> <t5047>With this appearance, he resembled cannibals described in encyclopedias more than a child.</t5047>
<t5048>Fernanda had never accounted for this twist of her unyielding fate.</t5048>
<t5049>The child had appeared like the return of a disgrace that Fernanda thought she had gotten rid of by sending away from the house.</t5049> <t5050>At the moment they took away Mauricio Babilonia, whose spine was shattered, Fernanda had meticulously devised a plan to erase all traces of this troublemaker.</t5050> <t5051>Without consulting her husband, she packed her suitcases, placed three sets of necessary underwear for her daughter in a small suitcase, and went to her daughter's room half an hour before the train arrived.</t5051>
<t5052>-Come on, we're going, Renata, he said.</t5052>
<t5053>He did not make any explanation.</t5053> <t5054>Meme neither expected nor wanted such an explanation.</t5054> <t5055>She did not know where they were going, and even if she knew they were taking her to a slaughterhouse to be butchered, she still wouldn't care.</t5055> <t5056>She hadn't spoken since the moment she heard the gunshot in the backyard and Mauricio Babilonia's agonized scream, and she would not open her mouth until the end of her life.</t5056> <t5057>When her mother told her to leave the room, Meme followed her without combing her hair or washing her face, and boarded the train as if sleepwalking, without even noticing the yellow butterflies that still surrounded her.</t5057>
<t5058>Fernanda never understood whether this stone-like silence was a determination tied to her daughter's willpower or if the girl had been struck mute by the tragedy, and she never bothered to find out.</t5058> <t5059>As they passed through places once considered magical, Meme didn't even look at where they were.</t5059> <t5060>She didn't see the shadowy banana trees stretching as far as the eye could see on both sides of the railway.</t5060> <t5061>She didn't see the gringos' white houses, their gardens dried out from dust and heat, or the women in shorts and blue-striped shirts playing cards on the terraces.</t5061> <t5062>She didn't see the ox carts loaded with bunches of bananas on the dusty roads.</t5062> <t5063>She didn't see the girls who jumped into the still rivers like fish and lifted the hearts of the train passengers with their beautiful breasts.</t5063> <t5064>She didn't see the cramped, impoverished workers' shacks in the places where Mauricio Babilonia's yellow butterflies fluttered, the neglected, green-faced children sitting on stools in front of the shacks, or the pregnant women hurling curses as the train passed by.</t5064>
<t5065>These scenes, which used to be a source of joy when coming home from school, this time passed by without stirring the slightest emotion in Meme's heart.</t5065>
<t5066>She never looked out the window.</t5066> <t5067>Even when the stifling humidity of the banana trees ended, and the train passed through the poppy-filled plain where the charred skeleton of the Spanish galleon stood, and reached the foamy, muddy seashore where Jose Arcadio Buendia's dreams had ended about a hundred years ago, Meme did not turn her head to look outside.</t5067>
<t5068>When they arrived at the last station of the swamp area at five in the afternoon, Meme got off because Fernanda made her get off the train.</t5068>
<t5069>They boarded a small carriage, reminiscent of a large bat, pulled by a wheezing horse, and passed through the endless, deserted streets of the city.</t5069> <t5070>On the street, a piano sound reminiscent of the piano lessons Fernanda heard during her afternoon naps in her youth could be heard.</t5070> <t5071>They boarded a riverboat.</t5071>
<t5072>The wooden wheel of the steamboat was turning with a crackling sound as if it had caught fire, and the rusted metal plates were burning like the mouth of an opened furnace.</t5072> <t5073>Meme shut herself in her cabin.</t5073> <t5074>Fernanda would leave a plate of food next to her bed twice a day, and twice a day she would take the untouched plate back.</t5074> <t5075>Meme was not eating, not because she had decided to starve to death, but because her stomach couldn't even handle water.</t5075> <t5076>At that time, neither Fernanda nor the girl herself knew that her fertility outweighed the mustard plasters.</t5076> <t5077>Fernanda would only learn this a year later when they brought the child.</t5077> <t5078>Shut in the suffocating cabin, Meme lost track of the days, driven mad by the vibration of the metal plates and the unbearable smell of the water churned by the wheel next to her.</t5078> <t5079>It had been a long time since she had seen the last of the yellow butterflies crash into the ceiling fan's blade and die, making her believe, as an undeniable fact, that Mauricio Babilonia was dead.</t5079> <t5080>Yet she did not let herself go.</t5080>
<t5081>She never got Mauricio Babilonia out of her mind.</t5081> <t5082>When Aureliano Segundo set out to find the most beautiful woman on earth and lost his way in the highlands, Meme was always thinking of Mauricio as they passed through on muleback.</t5082> <t5083>As they crossed the mountains following the trails of the Indians, she was always thinking of Mauricio.</t5083> <t5084>As they entered the gloomy town where the thirty-two death bells stolen from thirty-two churches echoed through the cobblestone streets, she was always thinking of Mauricio.</t5084> <t5085>That night, they slept on the planks Fernanda had placed on the floor in a room overgrown with weeds in the mansion that had turned into a ruin.</t5085>
<t5086>They wrapped themselves in old curtains that they took out from the windows and that fell apart piece by piece with every turn in their sleep.</t5086> <t5087>Meme had understood where they were.</t5087>
<t5088>Because when he couldn't sleep and was curled up in fear, the man in black clothes who had come out of the chest on a Christmas day long ago had passed by him.</t5088> <t5089>The next day, after praying in the church, Fernanda took him to a place that darkened one's soul with every step.</t5089> <t5090>When Meme, recalling the stories her mother told her in childhood, realized that this was the convent where Fernanda was raised and prepared for queenship, she understood that their journey had come to an end.</t5090>
<t5091>While Fernanda was talking to someone in the adjacent room, Meme waited in the hall filled with large oil paintings of colonial bishops.</t5091> <t5092>She was still wearing a dress made of black etamine with small flowers, and on her feet, swollen from the mountain chill, she had high-heeled shoes.</t5092> <t5093>Meme, standing under the yellow light filtering through the stained glass, was thinking of Mauricio Babilonia when a novice nun entered the room.</t5093>
<t5094>He had a suitcase containing Meme's three layers of laundry in his hand.</t5094> <t5095>As he passed by, without breaking his stride, he took Meme's hand.</t5095>
<t5096>"Come, Renata," he said.</t5096>
<t5097>Meme gave her hand to the girl and followed her.</t5097> <t5098>Fernanda saw her for the last time, trying to keep up with the novice.</t5098> <t5099>Then the iron gate leading to the inner courtyard of the convent closed behind her.</t5099> <t5100>Meme was still thinking about Mauricio Babilonia, the smell of machine oil, and the halo of yellow butterflies above his head.</t5100> <t5101>Many years later, in a gloomy hospital in Krakow, with her name changed, her hair shaved, and without having spoken a single word, she would still be thinking of Mauricio Babilonia until the day she died on an autumn day.</t5101>
<t5102>Fernanda returned to Macondo on a train guarded by armed police.</t5102> <t5103>Throughout the journey, the tension among the passengers, the military preparations in the towns along the railway, and the electric atmosphere indicating that something definitive was about to happen did not escape Fernanda's notice.</t5103>
<t5104>However, he received no information until he arrived in Macondo.</t5104>
<t5105>When he arrived in Macondo, they informed him that Jose Arcadio Segundo was inciting the workers at the Banana Company to strike.</t5105> <t5106>Fernanda muttered to herself, -This was the last thing we needed.</t5106> <t5107>-An anarchist was missing in the family.</t5107>
<t5108>Although the strike broke out two weeks later, it did not lead to the feared outcomes.</t5108>
<t5109>The workers did not want to cut and load bananas on Sundays either.</t5109>
<t5110>Peder Antonia Isabel, finding this request in accordance with God's laws, supported the strike.</t5110> <t5111>The success of the strike and the actions initiated in the following months brought the obscure Jose Arcadio Segundo to the forefront and made his name known.</t5111> <t5112>However, until that day, it was said that he was good for nothing other than filling the town with French harlots.</t5112> <t5113>Just as one day he whimsically sold his fighting cocks and got into that foolish boat business, this time he left his foreman position at the Banana Company and sided with the workers.</t5113> <t5114>Soon after, he was branded as an agent of a foreign-rooted action aimed at disrupting the country's order: At the end of a silent week darkened by rumors, one night, he miraculously survived four bullets fired by unknown assailants as he was leaving a secret meeting.</t5114> <t5115>In the months following the incident, the atmosphere was so heavy and tense that even Ursula sensed it from her dark corner, and she felt as if she was reliving those dangerous days when her son Aureliano walked around with bullets in his pocket.</t5115>
<t5116>He wanted to talk to Jose Arcadio Segundo, recount old events, and bend his ear.</t5116> <t5117>But Aureliano Segundo said that after the night they tried to kill him, no one knew where Jose Arcadio Segundo was.</t5117>
<t5118>Ursula exclaimed, "Just like Aureliano!"</t5118> <t5119>"It's as if the world is repeating itself."</t5119>
<t5120>Fernanda was indifferent to the chaos of those days.</t5120> <t5121>Since the day she fought with Aureliano Segundo for deciding Meme's fate without consulting him, she had cut off her connection with the outside world.</t5121> <t5122>Aureliano Segundo was determined to rescue his daughter with the help of the police if necessary, but Fernanda produced and showed some documents indicating that Meme had entered the convent of her own free will.</t5122>
<t5123>After the iron door closed behind Meme, she had indeed signed the papers of her own free will, and she did it with the indifference she showed while following the novice nun.</t5123> <t5124>Regardless, Aureliano Segundo could never believe in the validity of the documents his wife presented as evidence; just as he couldn't believe that Mauricio Babilonia had entered the garden to steal chickens.</t5124> <t5125>But the apparent evidence made it easier for him to silence his conscience, and without feeling any remorse, Aureliano Segundo took refuge in Petra Cotes' embrace and resumed his lavish spending and noisy festivities.</t5125>
<t5126>Fernanda, who remained oblivious to the unrest in the town and turned a deaf ear to Ursula's silent prophecies, tightened the last screw of her premeditated plan.</t5126> <t5127>She wrote a long letter to her son Jose Arcadio, who was about to enter the priesthood, informing him that his sister Renata had coughed up blood and finally found peace in the presence of God.</t5127> <t5128>Then, leaving the care of Amaranta Ursula to Santa Sofia de la Piedad, she resumed the correspondence she had paused due to Meme's troubles, dedicating all her time to communicating with invisible doctors.</t5128> <t5129>Her first task was to set a date for the postponed telepathic surgery.</t5129> <t5130>However, the invisible doctors advised that it would not be wise to proceed with the surgery as long as the turmoil in Macondo continued.</t5130> <t5131>Fernanda was in such a hurry for the surgery to be performed as soon as possible and was so unaware of what was happening in the town that she immediately wrote another letter to the doctors.</t5131>
<t5132>He reported that there was no confusion, no provocative action, and that everything that happened was the doing of his brother-in-law, who once obsessed over cockfighting and riverboats, and now was fixated on the nonsense of unionism.</t5132>
<t5133>Until that hot Wednesday when the old nun with a small basket on her arm knocked on the door, Fernanda and the doctors had not yet come to an agreement.</t5133> <t5134>When Santa Sofia de la Piedad opened the door, she thought a gift had arrived and wanted to take the small basket covered with a beautiful lace cloth.</t5134> <t5135>However, the nun did not give her the basket, because she had been strictly instructed to give it to Dona Fernanda del Carpio de Buendia with great secrecy.</t5135> <t5136>Inside the basket was Meme's son.</t5136>
<t5137>Fernanda's former religion teacher, in the letter he wrote, was informing that the child was born two months ago and since the mother did not open her mouth to speak, they baptized the child with his grandfather's name, calling him Aureliano.</t5137>
<t5138>Although Fernanda inwardly rebelled against this twist of fate, she found the strength to hide it from the nun.</t5138>
<t5139>Smiling, "We will say that we found the child in a basket floating on the river," he said.</t5139>
<t5140>The nun replied, "No one will believe this."</t5140>
<t5141>Fernanda said, "When it's written in the Bible, they believe it. Why don't they believe it when I say it?"</t5141>
<t5142>The nun sat at home, ate, and did not mention the child's words in the way they twisted her ear until the return train arrived.</t5142>
<t5143>However, Fernanda saw him as a witness to her disgrace and cursed the abolition of the tradition of hanging bearers of bad news in the Middle Ages.</t5143> <t5144>That's when, as soon as she went to the nun, she decided to drown the child in the water tank.</t5144> <t5145>But her heart was not strong enough.</t5145>
<t5146>He preferred to patiently wait for the day when God's infinite goodness would save him from this trouble.</t5146>
<t5147>When the tension among the people suddenly erupted without any prior warning, the new Aureliano was one year old.</t5147> <t5148>Until then, Jose Arcadio Segundo and the other union leaders, who had been underground, suddenly emerged one weekend and organized demonstrations in the towns of the banana region.</t5148>
<t5149>The police only maintained public order.</t5149> <t5150>But on Monday night, the leaders were individually gathered from their homes, shackled with one-kilogram weights on their feet, and thrown into the central prison of the province.</t5150> <t5151>Among them were Jose Arcadio Segundo and Lorenzo Gavilan, who was a colonel in the Mexican revolution and was in exile in Macondo.</t5151>
<t5152>Gavilan would constantly recount witnessing the heroics of his comrade Artemio Cruz.</t5152> <t5153>Since the government and the Banana Company could not reach an agreement on who would take responsibility for the care of the prisoners, the detainees were released after three months.</t5153> <t5154>This time, the workers mobilized to protest the lack of plumbing in their homes, the absence of healthcare services, and the harsh working conditions.</t5154> <t5155>The workers claimed that their wages were not paid in cash, but instead they were given coupons, which could only be used to buy Virginia ham at the company's store.</t5155> <t5156>Jose Arcadio Segundo was imprisoned for exposing the truth behind the coupon system.</t5156> <t5157>If the company's fruit-carrying ships did not bring goods to the store, they would have to return empty from the ports where they loaded bananas in New Orleans.</t5157> <t5158>However, the coupons given to the workers led to demands for goods that would provide cargo for the company's ships on their return journey.</t5158> <t5159>The other demands and complaints of the workers were well-known to everyone.</t5159> <t5160>The company's doctors would not examine sick workers; they would line them up in a single file at the dispensary, and the nurse, without any distinction, would place a copper sulfate-colored pill on the tongue of each one, whether they had malaria, gonorrhea, or constipation.</t5160>
<t5161>This method of treatment was so customary that children would get in line several times in a row, not swallow the pills placed on their tongues, and take them home to use as bingo chips.</t5161> <t5162>The workers at the company lived in overcrowded, deplorable barracks.</t5162> <t5163>Instead of building toilets where the workers lived, the engineers would bring portable field latrines, one for every fifty people, every Christmas and show everyone how to use them so they would last longer.</t5163>
<t5164>The once black-clad, now elderly lawyers who surrounded Colonel Aureliano Buendia and are now managed by the Banana Company, were rejecting the workers' demands with decisions that seemed neither magical nor miraculous.</t5164> <t5165>The workers prepared a collective agreement outlining their common demands.</t5165> <t5166>However, it took quite some time for them to officially notify the company of these demands.</t5166> <t5167>As soon as Mister Brown learned that the workers had signed the agreement, he attached his luxurious private carriage to the train, took the company's top representatives with him, and fled from Macondo.</t5167>
<t5168>However, a few of the workers cornered them in a brothel the following Saturday, and while Mister Brown was having a wild time completely naked with the women who helped set him up, they made him sign a copy of the contract.</t5168> <t5169>The lawyers in black suits proved in court that the man who signed the contract had no connection with the company, and to leave no doubt about it, they had the man imprisoned for fraud.</t5169> <t5170>Later, while Mister Brown was traveling under another name and in third class, the workers found him again and made him sign another copy of the contract.</t5170>
<t5171>Mister Brown appeared in court the next day with his hair dyed black and speaking with a perfect Spanish accent.</t5171>
<t5172>The lawyers said that he was not the manager of the Banana Company, Mister Jack Brown, born in Prattville, Alabama, but rather a modest pharmaceutical propagandist named Dagoberto Fonseca, who was born and raised in Macondo.</t5172> <t5173>After a while, faced with a new attempt by the workers to get the contract signed, the lawyers made Mister Brown's death report public.</t5173> <t5174>In the report, signed by consuls and foreign representatives as witnesses, it was documented that Mister Brown had died on the ninth of last June, being run over by a fire truck in Chicago.</t5174>
<t5175>The workers, weary of these sleights of hand, lost hope in the authorities in Macondo and presented their complaints to the supreme court.</t5175> <t5176>Here too, the lawyers swiftly proved that the demands put forward were invalid.</t5176>
<t5177>Because it was proven with documents that the Banana Company neither in the past, nor now, nor in the future has employed or will employ workers, and that the complainants were hired as temporary and contract laborers.</t5177> <t5178>Therefore, the Virginia ham story, the miracle cure stories, and the makeshift desert latrines fabrications held no meaning.</t5178> <t5179>This situation was determined by a court decision and it was grandly recorded in the minutes that the workers did not exist.</t5179>
<t5180>The big strike began.</t5180> <t5181>Work in the banana plantations came to a halt halfway, fruits rotted on the trees, and trains with one hundred and twenty wagons waited empty on the sidetracks.</t5181> <t5182>The workers who were not working filled the towns.</t5182>
<t5183>The Turkish Street experienced the hustle and bustle of a Saturday for several days.</t5183> <t5184>Hotel Jacob's billiard room had to remain open twenty-four hours a day.</t5184> <t5185>At the time it was announced that the army was tasked with restoring order, Jose Arcadio Segundo was playing billiards.</t5185> <t5186>Although Jose Arcadio Segundo was not one to believe in prophecies, this news still seemed to him like the harbinger of the death he had been expecting since the day he watched the man executed by firing squad with Colonel Gerineldo Marquez's permission.</t5186>
<t5187>But he did not lose his composure due to this bad premonition.</t5187> <t5188>He made the shot he had planned and sent the billiard ball to the desired spot.</t5188> <t5189>The sound of drums and trumpets heard shortly after, along with the people's rush, made Jose Arcadio Segundo realize that not only the billiard game but also the game he had been playing by himself since the execution scene had come to an end.</t5189> <t5190>Then he went out to the street and saw them.</t5190> <t5191>Three regiments were marching in step with the drumbeat.</t5191> <t5192>Their breaths, resembling the growl of a many-headed monster, seemed to emit poisonous vapor into the air shining with the midday sun.</t5192> <t5193>The soldiers were short, stocky, and animal-like in build.</t5193> <t5194>They were sweating like horses, smelling of sunburnt animal hide, and enduring with the stubborn and silent resistance typical of mountain people.</t5194> <t5195>Although the passage of the regiments lasted more than an hour, they were no different from a few squads circling in successive loops.</t5195>
<t5196>Because they were all equals, all children of the same whore, and they carried the weight of their backpacks and canteens, the shame of their bayoneted rifles, the incurable boil of blind obedience, and their so-called sense of honor with the same indifference.</t5196> <t5197>Ursula heard the passing of the soldiers from her shadowy bed and crossed herself.</t5197> <t5198>Santa Sofia de la Piedad leaned on the freshly ironed embroidered tablecloth, thinking of her son Jose Arcadio Segundo, and existed for a moment.</t5198> <t5199>At that moment, Jose Arcadio Segundo, without changing the expression on his face, was watching the passing soldiers from the door of Hotel Jacob.</t5199>
<t5200>Martial law was declared and all the powers to resolve the conflict were given to the army, but the army made no effort towards reconciliation.</t5200> <t5201>As soon as the soldiers arrived in Macondo, they put their rifles aside, cut bananas, loaded them, and operated the trains.</t5201> <t5202>The workers, who had been waiting without doing anything until that moment, entered the plantations with nothing but banana machetes in their hands and began to sabotage the sabotage.</t5202>
<t5203>They burned plantations and sales depots, dismantled railway tracks to stop trains advancing with machine gun fire, and cut telegraph and telephone lines.</t5203> <t5204>The irrigation canals were stained with blood.</t5204> <t5205>Mister Brown, who lived securely behind electric chicken wire with his family and fellow countrymen, was taken out of Macondo and transported to a safe place under military protection.</t5205> <t5206>When the situation showed the danger of turning into a civil war that would continue under bloody and unstable conditions, the authorities called for the workers to gather in Macondo.</t5206> <t5207>It was announced that the martial law commander, who had taken over the civil and military administration, would arrive on Friday to find a solution to the conflict.</t5207>
<t5208>Jose Arcadio Buendia was among the crowd gathered at the station early Monday morning.</t5208> <t5209>He had attended the meeting held by the union leaders and, along with Colonel Gavilan, was tasked with mingling with the crowd and managing it according to the developments of the events.</t5209>
<t5210>He was not in a good mood.</t5210> <t5211>His mouth felt dry.</t5211> <t5212>As he looked around, he saw soldiers lined up with machine guns around the small area and the Banana Company's site surrounded by barbed wire and protected by cannons.</t5212> <t5213>By around twelve o'clock, the crowd of over three thousand people, men and women, young and old, waiting for the train that never came, had filled the open space in front of the station and started to spill into the streets held by soldiers with machine guns.</t5213> <t5214>They had the air of people having fun at a fair rather than a waiting crowd.</t5214> <t5215>They had brought in pita carts and lemonade vendors from Turkish Street, and despite the tension of waiting and the scorching sun, they had not lost their cheerfulness.</t5215>
<t5216>As it approached three o'clock, rumors spread that the train would not arrive before the next day.</t5216>
<t5217>The crowd sighed in disappointment.</t5217> <t5218>Upon this, a lieutenant climbed onto the roof of the station where four machine guns were aimed at the crowd and told them to be quiet.</t5218> <t5219>Next to Jose Arcadio stood a fat, barefoot woman with two children, one four and the other seven years old.</t5219>
<t5220>She had taken the smallest of the children in her arms.</t5220> <t5221>Without knowing who Jose Arcadio Segundo was, she turned to him and asked him to take the other child in his arms so she could hear better.</t5221> <t5222>Jose Arcadio Segundo took the child onto his shoulder.</t5222> <t5223>Years later, that child would insistently try to convince those who did not believe his words and tell that he had listened to the Martial Law Command's declaration No. 4</t5223> <t5224> being read from an old gramophone horn used as a megaphone</t5224> <t5225>The proclamation bore the signatures of General Carlos Cortes Vargas and his secretary Major Enrique Garcia Isaza.</t5225>
<t5226>General, in the three-item statement consisting of eighty words, described the strikers as a handful of rascals and granted the soldiers the authority to kill.</t5226>
<t5227>After the declaration was read, amidst deafening protest noises, a captain climbed onto the station's roof, took the lieutenant's place, and indicated that he wanted to speak by shaking the megaphone.</t5227> <t5228>The crowd fell silent again.</t5228>
<t5229>The captain, in a tired and low voice, slowly began to speak, -Ladies and gentlemen.</t5229> <t5230>-I am giving you five minutes to disperse.</t5230>
<t5231>The starting whistle that marked the beginning of the given time was drowned out amidst boos and shouts.</t5231> <t5232>No one moved from their place.</t5232>
<t5233>The captain said in the same tone, "The five minutes are up."</t5233> <t5234>"I am giving you one more minute, after that we will open fire."</t5234>
<t5235>Jose Arcadio Segundo, who was breaking out in cold sweats, took the child off his shoulder and handed it to the woman.</t5235> <t5236>The woman murmured, "These rascals might just open fire."</t5236>
<t5237>Jose Arcadio Segundo did not have a chance to open his mouth.</t5237> <t5238>Because at that moment, he heard Colonel Gavilan's thick, hoarse voice shouting out the woman's words.</t5238> <t5239>Jose Arcadio Segundo, who was dizzy from the tension, affected by the miraculous depth of the silence, and convinced that nothing could move the crowd, which was gripped by a passion for death, stood on his tiptoes, raised his head higher than those in front of him, and for the first time in his life, raised his voice:</t5239>
<t5240>"You scoundrels!" he shouted.</t5240> <t5241>"Take that one minute you gave and shove it up your ass!"</t5241>
<t5242>What happened after his shouting did not scare anyone.</t5242> <t5243>Everyone thought they were seeing things.</t5243> <t5244>The captain gave the order to fire, and fourteen machine guns executed the command at that moment.</t5244> <t5245>But all of this seemed like a ridiculous game.</t5245>
<t5246>It was as if the machine guns were loaded with blank cartridges.</t5246> <t5247>Because although the rattling of the guns was heard and it was seen that they were spewing bullets without stopping, there was not the slightest reaction from the crowd.</t5247> <t5248>Not a sound, not a breath was heard from the crowd that suddenly stood as if turned to stone.</t5248> <t5249>Suddenly, a death scream rising from the direction of the station broke the spell.</t5249> <t5250>The sound heard was a cry of "Aaah, my mother," a voice that shook the earth and sky, a volcanic breath, a roar that changed worlds, and it exploded like a bomb in the middle of the crowd.</t5250> <t5251>As the crowd, seething in panic, swallowed and dragged the woman with the child in her arms, Jose Arcadio Segundo only had the chance to catch the other child.</t5251>
<t5252>Years later, that child would recount that day, without caring that they considered him a senile old man, and he would vividly describe how Jose Arcadio Segundo lifted him up and carried him through the terrified crowd as if floating, to a nearby street.</t5252> <t5253>Because the child was above everyone else, he could see the frenzied crowd in the square running towards the corner and the machine gunners opening fire, and at the same moment, several people shouting at once, -Get down!</t5253>
<t5254>He could hear them shouting, "Get down on the ground!"</t5254>
<t5255>The ones in front had already been mowed down by the first wave of bullets and had fallen to the ground.</t5255> <t5256>The survivors tried to retreat to a small area instead of lying down on the ground.</t5256> <t5257>However, the machine gunners across the street had also started firing.</t5257> <t5258>Trapped between two fires, the crowd resembled a dragon's tail flailing in two directions.</t5258>
<t5259>The crowd began to turn like a massive vortex.</t5259> <t5260>They were diminishing towards the center like an onion being peeled layer by layer by the unceasing fire of the machine guns.</t5260> <t5261>The child saw a woman kneeling in the open, holding her arms in a cross shape, mysteriously protected from the bullets.</t5261> <t5262>At the moment Jose Arcadio Segundo fell to the ground with his face covered in blood, he left the child there.</t5262> <t5263>Immediately afterward, the large crowd covered that void, the kneeling woman, the light in the arid sky, and this whore world where Ursula Iguara sold candies in the shape of animals in heaps.</t5263>
<t5264>When Jose Arcadio Segundo came to, he was lying on his back in the dark.</t5264> <t5265>He sensed that he was on an endless journey on a silent train.</t5265> <t5266>Clots of blood had dried on his head.</t5266> <t5267>All his bones ached.</t5267> <t5268>He felt an irresistible desire to sleep.</t5268> <t5269>Preparing to sleep for hours, far from that atmosphere of horror and terror, he turned to the least painful side and, as he turned, realized he was lying among the dead.</t5269> <t5270>Inside the wagon, there was no space except for the narrow path to pass through.</t5270> <t5271>Several hours must have passed since the massacre; because the corpses had reached the coldness and dullness that plaster would take on in the autumn air.</t5271> <t5272>Moreover, those who had placed them in the wagon had found enough time to stack them one on top of the other, just like they loaded banana bunches.</t5272>
<t5273>Jose Arcadio Segundo, from this nightmare</t5273>
<t5274>He started to move forward in the direction the train was going, dragging himself from car to car to escape and survive.</t5274> <t5275>As they passed through sleeping towns, in the light seeping through the boards, he saw the corpses of men, women, and children that would be thrown into the sea like unwanted rotten bananas.</t5275> <t5276>Among the corpses, he could only recognize a woman who sold lemonade in the square and General Gavilan, who still held the belt with a Marelya silver buckle that he had swung to clear a path through the panic.</t5276> <t5277>When he reached the frontmost car, he threw himself into the dark void and lay down beside the tracks, waiting for the train to pass.</t5277>
<t5278>This was the longest train Jose Arcadio Segundo had ever seen.</t5278> <t5279>It had nearly two hundred freight cars and three locomotives: one in the front, one in the back, and one in the middle.</t5279>
<t5280>The train was pitch dark, it hadn't even turned on its red and green lights.</t5280> <t5281>It was moving rapidly.</t5281> <t5282>The dark silhouettes of soldiers with machine guns could be seen on the carriages.</t5282>
<t5283>After midnight, it started raining cats and dogs.</t5283> <t5284>Jose Arcadio Segundo didn't know where he jumped off the train, but he figured that if he headed in the opposite direction of the train's path, he would reach Macondo.</t5284> <t5285>After walking for more than three hours with a headache and soaked to the bone, he could make out the first houses of the town as dawn broke.</t5285> <t5286>Unable to resist the smell of coffee, he entered a kitchen where a woman with a child in her lap was sitting by the stove.</t5286>
<t5287>In a weary voice, "Hello," he said.</t5287> <t5288>"I am Jose Arcadio Segundo Buendia."</t5288>
<t5289>To convince the woman that he was alive, he had spelled out his name by pressing each letter individually.</t5289> <t5290>It was a good thing he did, because when the woman saw this dirty and dark shadow covered in blood, she thought she had seen a ghost and froze as if death had stepped inside the door.</t5290> <t5291>Then she recognized him.</t5291> <t5292>She brought a blanket for him to wrap himself in until his clothes dried by the fire; she heated water to clean his wound, which was just a minor scratch, and gave him a clean cloth to wrap his head.</t5292> <t5293>Then, because she had heard that the Buendias drank it that way, she offered him a cup of black coffee and laid his clothes out in front of the fire.</t5293>
<t5294>Jose Arcadio Segundo did not speak until he finished his coffee.</t5294>
<t5295>"There were about three thousand," he murmured.</t5295>
<t5296>Jose Arcadio Segundo said, "The dead."</t5296> <t5297>"Everyone at the station must be dead."</t5297>
<t5298>The woman looked at him as if she pitied him.</t5298> <t5299>"No one has ever died here," she said.</t5299> <t5300>"Since the time of your great uncle the colonel, nothing has happened in Macondo."</t5300> <t5301>In the kitchens of the other three houses Jose Arcadio Segundo visited before reaching his own, they said the same thing: "No one has ever died."</t5301> <t5302>Jose Arcadio Segundo stepped out into the small area in front of the station.</t5302> <t5303>The trays of the pie vendors were stacked on top of each other.</t5303> <t5304>There was no trace of the massacre.</t5304> <t5305>The streets were completely empty under the constant rain.</t5305> <t5306>It seemed as if there was no one behind the closed doors and windows of the houses.</t5306> <t5307>The only thing indicating the presence of life in the town was the sound of the church bells calling for mass.</t5307> <t5308>Jose Arcadio Segundo stopped by Colonel Gavilan's house.</t5308> <t5309>A pregnant woman he had seen a few times before slammed the door in his face.</t5309> <t5310>In a fearful voice, she said, "Gavilan is gone."</t5310> <t5311>"He returned to his homeland."</t5311>
<t5312>The local police were on guard at the main entrance of the chicken wire fence, as usual.</t5312>
<t5313>They stood like stones in the rain with their rubber boots and oilskins.</t5313>
<t5314>When Jose Arcadio Segundo came home, he jumped over the garden wall and entered through the kitchen.</t5314> <t5315>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, afraid to raise her voice, said, "Don't let Señora Fernanda see you."</t5315> <t5316>"She will wake up soon," Santa Sofia de la Piedad, as if adhering to a secret agreement, led her son to the 'sitting room</t5316><t5317>'</t5317>
<t5318>he took it, fixed Melquiades' broken bed, and when Fernanda went to sleep at two in the afternoon, he put his son's meal on a plate and handed it out the window.</t5318>
<t5319>Aureliano Segundo had stayed overnight because he was at home when the rain started.</t5319> <t5320>Even though it was three o'clock, he was still waiting for the weather to clear up.</t5320> <t5321>When Santa Sofia de la Piedad secretly told him that his brother had arrived, Aureliano Segundo went into Melquiades' room to see him.</t5321> <t5322>Aureliano Segundo also did not believe the massacre story that Jose Arcadio Segundo told and the nightmarish journey of the corpse-filled train heading towards the sea.</t5322> <t5323>The previous evening, he had read in an extraordinary bulletin addressed to the nation that the workers had left the station and quietly dispersed in small groups to return to their homes.</t5323> <t5324>The bulletin also mentioned that the patriotic union leaders had reduced their demands to two points: they wanted nothing more than a reform in health services and the construction of toilets in the houses.</t5324> <t5325>In a later statement, it was mentioned that when the military authorities reached an agreement with the workers, they informed Mister Brown, who not only responded positively to these demands but also announced that he would hold a three-day and three-night celebration to mark the end of the dispute and would pay for the festivities out of his own pocket.</t5325>
<t5326>The only event not mentioned in the report was when the soldiers asked when the agreement would be signed, Mister Brown looked at the sky illuminated by lightning and shrugged as if to say, "How should I know?" and said, "When the rain stops."</t5326> <t5327>"As long as it rains, we are halting all activities."</t5327>
<t5328>It hadn't rained for three months, and there was a drought.</t5328> <t5329>But as soon as Mister Brown announced his decision, rain started pouring down in the banana region as if from buckets.</t5329> <t5330>Jose Arcadio Segundo got caught in this rain while returning to Macondo.</t5330> <t5331>A week later, it was still raining.</t5331> <t5332>The official account of the event had been repeated perhaps a thousand times, spread to every corner of the country through all the communication tools at the government's disposal, and eventually accepted.</t5332> <t5333>According to the authorities, there were no casualties; the workers, whose demands were met, had returned to their families, and the Banana Company had suspended its operations until the rains stopped.</t5333>
<t5334>Although martial law was maintained to take necessary precautions against a potential disaster caused by the incessant rain, the soldiers withdrew to their barracks.</t5334> <t5335>During the day, the soldiers roamed the waterlogged streets with their pant legs rolled up, floating paper boats in puddles along with the children.</t5335>
<t5336>At night, after getting drunk, they would pound on doors with the butts of their rifles, rouse suspicious individuals from their beds, and take them on journeys of no return.</t5336> <t5337>The process of hunting down and eradicating the ruffians, subversives, arsonists, murderers, and rebels mentioned in the 4th proclamation continued unabated.</t5337>
<t5338>However, the military authorities denied this situation, telling the relatives of the victims who filled the commanders' rooms to get some news, "You must have been dreaming."</t5338> <t5339>"Nothing happened in Macondo."</t5339> <t5340>"Just as nothing has happened until today, nothing will happen in the future."</t5340> <t5341>"How fortunate for this town," they said.</t5341>
<t5342>By saying this over and over, they eventually swept away the union leaders.</t5342>
<t5343>Jose Arcadio Segundo was the only one who survived.</t5343> <t5344>One February night, the door began to shake with the well-known blows of a rifle butt.</t5344> <t5345>Aureliano Segundo, who was still waiting for the weather to clear, opened the door to the officer and six soldiers.</t5345> <t5346>The soldiers were drenched to the bone.</t5346> <t5347>Without saying a word, they ransacked the house from the living room to the granary; they searched room by room, cupboard by cupboard.</t5347> <t5348>Ursula woke up when they turned on the light in her room.</t5348> <t5349>But she didn't even take a breath until the search was completed.</t5349> <t5350>She only crossed her fingers in the shape of a cross and lay there, turning her fingers in the direction the soldiers moved around the room.</t5350> <t5351>Santa Sofia de la Piedad found an opportunity to inform Jose Arcadio Segundo, who was sleeping in Melquiades' room.</t5351> <t5352>However, he also knew it was too late to escape.</t5352> <t5353>Santa Sofia de la Piedad locked the door again.</t5353> <t5354>Jose Arcadio Segundo put on his shirt and shoes and began to wait for the soldiers.</t5354>
<t5355>The soldiers were searching the workshop at that moment.</t5355><t5356>The officer told the soldiers to unlock it, then he shone his flashlight around the room, and upon seeing the workbench and the glass cabinet filled with tools and acid bottles left by its owner, he concluded that no one was in the room.</t5356><t5357>Still, not letting his guard down, he asked Aureliano Segundo if he was a silversmith.</t5357><t5358>When he learned that it was Colonel Aureliano Buendia's workshop, the officer let out an "Ohoo!" and then ordered the lights to be turned on and the room to be thoroughly searched.</t5358><t5359>The soldiers searched so thoroughly that they even found the eighteen fish that had not been melted down, hidden in a tin behind the flowers.</t5359><t5360>The officer lined up the fish on the workbench, examined them one by one, and then his humane side surfaced.</t5360><t5361>"If you permit, I would like to take one," he said.</t5361><t5362>"Once, these were a sign of death, but now they are considered antiques."</t5362><t5363>The officer was a very young man.</t5363><t5364>He was brave and had a natural courtesy that had not emerged until that moment.</t5364><t5365>Aureliano Segundo gave him one of the fish.</t5365><t5366>With eyes shining with childlike joy, the officer put the fish in his shirt pocket.</t5366><t5367>He then refilled the tin with the remaining fish and put it back in its original place.</t5367>
<t5368>"I will keep this as a very precious memory," he said.</t5368> <t5369>"Colonel Aureliano Buendia was one of our greatest men."</t5369>
<t5370>However, this humane sentiment did not prevent the officer from carrying out his duties.</t5370>
<t5371>When they arrived at Melquiades' room, which had been locked up again, Santa Sofia de la Piedad murmured with a last glimmer of hope, "No one has sat in this room for a hundred years."</t5371> <t5372>The officer had the door opened and shone the lantern's light around the room.</t5372> <t5373>Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofia de la Piedad saw the dark eyes of Jose Arcadio Segundo, which were similar to those of Arabs, glinting in the light, and at that moment, they realized that a period of sorrow had ended, but a new period of sorrow, one that could only be endured by submitting and accepting it, had begun.</t5373>
<t5374>However, the officer continued to move the light of the lantern around the room and did not pay attention to anything until he saw the seventy-two seats piled in the cupboards.</t5374> <t5375>Then he turned on the light.</t5375> <t5376>Jose Arcadio, more pensive and thoughtful than ever, was sitting at the edge of the bed, ready to leave.</t5376>
<t5377>On the wall behind, there were shelves filled with old books, scrolls of manuscripts, and neatly arranged desks with ink in the inkwells that had not yet dried.</t5377> <t5378>As Aureliano Segundo knew from his childhood and everyone in the house except Colonel Aureliano Buendia noticed, the air in the room was clean, there was no dust anywhere, and nothing was worn out.</t5378> <t5379>The officer was only concerned with the chairs.</t5379>
<t5380>The officer asked, "How many people are there in the house?"</t5380>
<t5381>-Five.</t5381>
<t5382>The officer probably didn't understand.</t5382> <t5383>He looked at the void where Aureliano Segundo and Santa Sofia de la Piedad were seeing Jose Arcadio Segundo.</t5383>
<t5384>Jose Arcadio Segundo sensed that the officer was looking at him, but not seeing him.</t5384>
<t5385>Then the officer turned off the light and closed the door.</t5385>
<t5386>Hearing what the officer told the soldiers, Aureliano Segundo realized that he too saw the room through Colonel Aureliano Buendia's eyes.</t5386>
<t5387>"It is clear that no one has set foot in this room for at least a hundred years," said the officer.</t5387> <t5388>"God knows, there might even be snakes."</t5388> <t5389>When the door closed, Jose Arcadio Segundo believed that the war had ended.</t5389> <t5390>Years ago, Colonel Aureliano Buendia had told him how war had a fascinating aspect, showing countless examples from his own experiences.</t5390> <t5391>Jose Arcadio Segundo had believed him.</t5391>
<t5392>On the night when the soldiers looked at his face without seeing him, Jose Arcadio Segundo, thinking about the tension of the past few months, the misery in prison, the panic at the station, and the train full of dead bodies, concluded that Colonel Aureliano Buendia was either a fraud or an idiot.</t5392> <t5393>He couldn't understand why the Colonel had spoken at such length to describe what he had heard in the war.</t5393>
<t5394>Because a single word was enough: Fear, yet in Melquiades' room, with the supernatural light, the sound of rain, and the sense of being invisible, he felt a peace he had never experienced for even a moment in his entire life until that day.</t5394>
<t5395>Now he was only afraid of being buried alive.</t5395> <t5396>He told Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who brought him his food, about this fear.</t5396> <t5397>His mother also promised to outlive him, defying natural forces, to ensure he would be buried after he died.</t5397> <t5398>Free from all fears, Jose Arcadio Segundo devoted himself to reading Melquiades' manuscripts.</t5398> <t5399>When he couldn't decipher the writings, he would tackle the task with even more enthusiasm.</t5399> <t5400>He got used to the sound of the rain, which had been falling incessantly for two months and had become another form of silence.</t5400>
<t5401>The only thing that disturbed his solitude was the comings and goings of Santa Sofia de la Piedad.</t5401>
<t5402>Therefore, he told his mother to leave the food by the window and to put a padlock on the door.</t5402> <t5403>After hearing that the soldiers did not see him even though they looked at him, the household, including Fernanda who did not object to her brother-in-law staying there, forgot about him.</t5403> <t5404>Six months after the soldiers left Macondo, Aureliano Segundo unlocked the door because he was looking for someone to chat with until the rains stopped.</t5404> <t5405>As soon as he opened the door, he was confronted with the nauseating smell of chamber pots.</t5405> <t5406>All the chamber pots were lined up on the floor, and all had been used several times.</t5406>
<t5407>Jose Arcadio Segundo, whose hair had almost completely fallen out, was reading and rereading the writings that could not be erased, without paying attention to the nauseating smells.</t5407> <t5408>He was illuminated by a light similar to a halo surrounding angels.</t5408>
<t5409>When he heard the door open, he only lifted his head and looked.</t5409>
<t5410>But this look was enough for his brother to see the incurable fate of their great-grandfather in his eyes.</t5410>
<t5411>Jose Arcadio Segundo, "There were more than three thousand," he says, and he would say no more.</t5411> <t5412>"I now know for certain that everyone at the station is dead."</t5412>
<t5413>The rain lasted exactly four years, eleven months, and two days.</t5413> <t5414>At times it would lighten, turning into a drizzle, and then everyone would dress up, preparing to celebrate the improvement in the weather.</t5414>
<t5415>But it was soon learned that these drizzly pauses were harbingers of a rain a thousand times worse than before.</t5415> <t5416>The air was filling and darkening with storms that destroyed everything they touched, and the face of the sky was wrinkling.</t5416>
<t5417>The hurricane coming from the north was blowing off roofs, tearing down walls, and uprooting and toppling all the banana trees in the orchards without leaving a single one standing.</t5417>
<t5418>Ursula remembered the insomnia epidemic.</t5418> <t5419>Because during the rain, just like during the insomnia epidemic, the disaster forced people to resist boredom.</t5419> <t5420>One of those who worked the hardest to avoid idleness was Aureliano Segundo.</t5420> <t5421>On the night Mister Brown started the storm, Aureliano Segundo had stopped by the house for something trivial.</t5421>
<t5422>When the rain started, Fernanda took out an umbrella with half of its wires broken, which she found at the bottom of a cupboard, and brought it to her husband, who said, "I don't need it."</t5422> <t5423>"I'll stay until the weather clears up," he said.</t5423> <t5424>Undoubtedly, it was not a binding promise, but even so, Aureliano Segundo felt the need to keep his word.</t5424>
<t5425>Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes' house, every three days he would take off what he was wearing and wait in his underwear until they were washed and dried.</t5425> <t5426>To keep himself from getting bored, he got involved in a bunch of repair jobs around the house.</t5426> <t5427>He fixed the hinges, oiled the locks, tightened the loose doorknobs, and planed the swollen doors.</t5427>
<t5428>The toolbox from the time of Jose Arcadio Buendia, acquired from the gypsies, did not leave Aureliano Segundo's hands for several months.</t5428>
<t5429>Whether it was from moving around a lot to fix this and that, from the boredom brought by winter, or from the mandatory diet, it is unknown, but his belly started to shrink little by little, the purpleness of his face, which resembled a turtle's back, began to fade, his double chin started to melt away, and he stopped resembling an elephant and reached the point where he could tie his own shoes.</t5429> <t5430>As Fernanda watched him install latches on doors and repair clocks, she wondered if her husband would enter into a similar cycle of endless tinkering with home repairs, just like Colonel Aureliano Buendia with his fish that he melted and remade, Amaranta with her never-ending shroud and the buttons she endlessly sewed and resewed, Jose Arcadio with the manuscripts he tried to decipher, and Ursula with her memories.</t5430>
<t5431>The worst part is that the rain damages everything and made this repair necessary.</t5431> <t5432>If it wasn't oiled every three days, it seemed like buds would sprout between the gears of the driest machines, rust stains would form on embroidery threads, and wet clothes would quickly develop saffron-colored mold.</t5432> <t5433>The air was so humid that fish would almost swim in through the doors, float in the room's air, and exit through the windows.</t5433> <t5434>One morning, when Ursula woke up, she felt that her end had come, that she would faint quietly and never wake up again, and she told them to take her to Father Antonio Isabel even if she had to be carried on a stretcher.</t5434> <t5435>When Santa Sofia de la Piedad propped her up slightly, she saw that leeches had covered her back from top to bottom.</t5435> <t5436>She removed the leeches one by one so they wouldn't drain the woman's blood, crushed them with tongs, and killed them.</t5436>
<t5437>To drain the water, it was necessary to dig channels, dry the boards, remove the bricks from under the beds, and to be able to walk around in shoes again, it was also necessary to get the snails and frogs out.</t5437>
<t5438>Aureliano Segundo, who had plunged into a heap of trivial tasks he needed to do, did not realize he had aged until one evening while watching the sunset, he thought of Petra Cotes without his heart and flesh stirring.</t5438> <t5439>Returning to the broad love of Fernanda, whose beauty had faded as she aged, was not difficult.</t5439> <t5440>However, the rain had dried Aureliano Segundo to the bone, detached him from passion, and dragged him into a solemnity born of indifference.</t5440>
<t5441>He was thinking about the rain that had been falling for a year now, and at other times he would have enjoyed imagining the things he could do with this rain.</t5441> <t5442>Long before the Banana Company came and zinc roofs became widespread, Aureliano Segundo was one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo.</t5442> <t5443>And he had them brought solely to lay on the roof of Petra Cotes' bedroom and to hold his mistress more tightly while listening to the rain hitting the zinc.</t5443>
<t5444>However, now even the memory of those wild youthful days no longer excited him.</t5444> <t5445>In the midst of the last revelry he embarked on, he had exhausted his reservoir of lust and was left breathless halfway through.</t5445> <t5446>Fortunately, he possessed the virtue of being able to recall all these without feeling a pang in his heart or any regret.</t5446> <t5447>Those who saw him in this state might think that he was taking advantage of the opportunity created by the storm to reflect deeply or that he longed for a multitude of useful tasks he could have done throughout his life but never did, while fiddling with pliers and an oil can.</t5447>
<t5448>However, the domesticity that began to envelop Aureliano Segundo had nothing to do with regret or a sudden onset of wisdom.</t5448>
<t5449>This feeling was from much further back, from the days when he read stories about flying carpets in Melquiades' room, and whales that swallowed entire ships with their crews, and the rain had stirred up this feeling, bringing it to the surface.</t5449> <t5450>It was in those days that little Aureliano, taking advantage of a moment of Fernanda's inattention, dashed out to the veranda and his grandfather realized who he was.</t5450> <t5451>He cut the child's hair, dressed him, taught him not to fear people, and soon it became clear that the child, with his prominent cheekbones, timid gaze, and introverted nature, was a true Aureliano Buendia.</t5451>
<t5452>Thus, Fernanda was relieved of a heavy burden.</t5452> <t5453>Fernanda had struggled with herself for a while, unable to bring herself to reveal the situation to her husband.</t5453> <t5454>She didn't know what to say, and every solution she found seemed irrational.</t5454>
<t5455>If he had known that Aureliano Segundo would react this way and start enjoying the pleasures of being a grandfather, he wouldn't have gone through so much trouble and would have gotten rid of this burden a year ago.</t5455> <t5456>Amaranta Ursula, who had just cut her second tooth, looked at her nephew as a toy to relieve her boredom.</t5456> <t5457>While Aureliano Segundo was thinking about how to entertain the children, he remembered the English encyclopedia that had been left untouched in Meme's old room.</t5457> <t5458>He started showing the children the pictures in the encyclopedia.</t5458> <t5459>He was especially showing them pictures of animals.</t5459>
<t5460>Then he showed maps of distant lands and photographs of famous people.</t5460> <t5461>Since he did not know English and could only distinguish pictures of very well-known cities and people, he invented various names and stories to satisfy the insatiable curiosity of the children.</t5461>
<t5462>Fernanda truly believed that her husband was waiting for the rain to stop so he could return to his mistress.</t5462> <t5463>During the early months of the rain, Fernanda was worried that her husband might enter the bedroom and she would have to explain the calamity that befell her after the birth of Amaranta Ursula, fearing the shame of revealing that she was no longer able to engage in relations.</t5463> <t5464>In fact, it was for this reason that she frequently sought out invisible doctors through correspondence, which was often interrupted due to the poor postal service.</t5464> <t5465>In the first months when news of trains derailing in the rain reached them, a letter from the invisible doctors arrived.</t5465>
<t5466>They were writing that the letters Fernanda sent to them did not reach their hands.</t5466> <t5467>Later, when communication with the doctors was cut off, Fernanda even considered putting on the tiger mask her husband wore at the carnival and showing herself to the doctors of the Banana company.</t5467> <t5468>But when one of the messengers who constantly brought news said that the company was going to move the dispensary to a place where it didn't rain, Fernanda's hopes were shattered.</t5468>
<t5469>He had no choice but to wait until the rain stopped and the mail was back in order.</t5469> <t5470>In the meantime, he was trying to heal himself as best as he could.</t5470> <t5471>He would rather die than go to that Frenchman in Macondo who ate grass like a donkey.</t5471> <t5472>He approached Ursula in the hope that she might find a temporary cure for his illness.</t5472> <t5473>However, due to his habit of not being able to name certain things, he left what needed to be said first until the end, and used terms like 'bring out' instead of 'give birth' and 'burning' instead of 'discharge' to avoid embarrassment.</t5473> <t5474>He confused things so much that Ursula concluded his problem was not in his womb but in his intestines and advised him to drink sweet sublimed mercury on an empty stomach.</t5474> <t5475>If he didn't have that shameful illness, which in itself was a disease, and if the letters hadn't been lost, Fernanda wouldn't have been bothered by the rain at all; because her whole life had been as if it were raining.</t5475> <t5476>She made no changes to her daily routine or the order of her prayers.</t5476>
<t5477>Even on days when the table was placed on bricks so that the feet of those eating wouldn't get wet, and boards were placed under the chairs, Fernanda never neglected the linen covers, porcelain sets, and candlesticks.</t5477>
<t5478>He found it unreasonable to use disasters as an excuse to break away from habits.</t5478> <t5479>No one was going out on the streets anymore.</t5479> <t5480>Whether to go out or not depended on Fernanda's views; even before the rains started, no one should have gone out.</t5480> <t5481>Because Fernanda believed that doors were invented to be kept closed and that only street women would be interested in what happened on the streets.</t5481>
<t5482>Still, when they said that Colonel Gerineldo Marquez's funeral procession was passing by, he was the first to look out the window.</t5482> <t5483>Even though he took a quick glance from the half-open window and then pulled back, he regretted showing such a weakness for a long time.</t5483>
<t5484>Fernanda could not imagine a more desolate, more sorrowful funeral procession than this.</t5484> <t5485>They had placed the coffin on an ox cart and made a canopy of banana leaves over it.</t5485> <t5486>However, the weather was so rainy, and the streets were so muddy that the wheels got stuck in the mud with each turn, shaking, and the heavy canopy seemed like it would fall apart with each jolt.</t5486> <t5487>The rainwater trickling down fell onto the coffin wrapped in a flag, soaking the flag stained with blood and gunpowder that the honorable veterans had once refused to accept.</t5487> <t5488>They had also placed the sword with silver and copper buckles, which Colonel Gerineldo Marquez had left on the coat rack to enter Amaranta's sewing room unarmed, on top of the coffin.</t5488>
<t5489>Behind the ox cart walked the survivors of the surrender negotiations at Neerlandia.</t5489> <t5490>They were barefoot.</t5490> <t5491>They had rolled up their trousers and were trudging through the mud.</t5491> <t5492>In one hand, they held sticks to prod the animals pulling the cart, and in the other, paper wreaths faded by the rain.</t5492> <t5493>They looked surreal on the street still bearing the name of Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t5493> <t5494>As they passed in front of the house, they all turned their heads to look at the windows.</t5494> <t5495>Then they rounded the corner leading to the square and had to help move the cart stuck in the mud.</t5495>
<t5496>Ursula, having Santa Sofia de la Piedad carry her, went out to the door.</t5496>
<t5497>He examined the hardships of the funeral procession so carefully that no one doubted what his eyes saw.</t5497> <t5498>Especially those who saw him waving his hand like a herald angel, in sync with the swaying of the carriage, would not believe he was blind even if they knew it.</t5498>
<t5499>Ursula called out, "Goodbye, my son Gerineldo."</t5499> <t5500>"Give my regards to everyone; tell them I will see them when the rains stop."</t5500>
<t5501>Aureliano Segundo took her to bed and asked what she meant when she spoke after the funeral with her usual informality.</t5501>
<t5502>Ursula said, "That's just how it is."</t5502> <t5503>"I'm waiting for the rain to stop so I can die."</t5503>
<t5504>The state of the streets was worrying Aureliano Segundo.</t5504>
<t5505>In the end, he wondered about the condition of his animals, and holding a tarp over his head, he went to Petra Cotes' house.</t5505> <t5506>He found Petra Cotes in the garden, waist-deep in water, trying to float a dead horse.</t5506> <t5507>Aureliano Segundo took a lever in his hand and helped her.</t5507> <t5508>The swollen body toppled over like a giant bell and was carried away by the torrent of muddy water.</t5508> <t5509>Since the rain had started, Petra Cotes had done nothing but remove the animal carcasses from the garden.</t5509>
<t5510>In the first weeks, she sent message after message to Aureliano Segundo to get him to do something, but Aureliano Segundo, saying there was no need to panic, that there was nothing to be afraid of, and that there would be plenty of time to think about what needed to be done once the weather cleared, did not go.</t5510> <t5511>Petra Cotes reported that the horse pastures were underwater, the sheep were swimming, there was no food left, and the animals had fallen prey to jaguars and disease.</t5511> <t5512>Aureliano Segundo responded, -There's nothing to be done, -when the weather improves, new ones will be born to replace the dead.</t5512> <t5513>Petra Cotes saw the animals dying in droves and could do nothing.</t5513>
<t5514>He was only cutting those stuck in the mud.</t5514> <t5515>He watched in silent despair as the wealth, once considered the greatest and most powerful in Macondo, vanished in the ruthlessness of the deluge, leaving behind nothing but disease and destitution.</t5515> <t5516>When Aureliano Segundo decided to take a look at what had happened, he saw that all that remained of the vast estate was a horse carcass and a trembling, emaciated mule in the ruined stable.</t5516> <t5517>When Petra Cotes saw him coming, she was neither surprised, happy, nor reproachful.</t5517> <t5518>She greeted Aureliano Segundo with only a faintly mocking smile.</t5518>
<t5519>"It was about time to come!" he said.</t5519>
<t5520>He had collapsed, reduced to skin and bones.</t5520> <t5521>His slanted eyes, reminiscent of predatory animals, had softened and saddened from watching the rain.</t5521>
<t5522>Aureliano Segundo was staying not because he was more comfortable at home, but because he couldn't decide to cover his head with oilcloth and go out into the street.</t5522> <t5523>As he said when he was at the other house, "There's no need to hurry," he said, "let's just hope the weather clears up in a few hours."</t5523> <t5524>During the first week, Aureliano Segundo got used to the marks that time and rain had left on his mistress's health.</t5524>
<t5525>He gradually began to see her as he used to, remembering her exuberance, her outbursts, the incredible fertility her love bestowed upon the animals, and one night during the second week, half out of curiosity, half out of love, he woke her up by caressing her.</t5525> <t5526>Petra Cotes did not respond to his behavior.</t5526> <t5527>"Come on, go to sleep," she murmured.</t5527> <t5528>"Now is not the time to think about such things."</t5528>
<t5529>Aureliano Segundo saw himself in the mirrors on the ceiling.</t5529> <t5530>He saw Petra Cotes' spine, now worn out and connected by frayed nerves, resembling a series of pulleys, and he agreed with her.</t5530> <t5531>Moreover, he found her justified not because it was not the time for such things, but because such things were now beyond them.</t5531>
<t5532>Concluding that not only Ursula but all the residents of Macondo were waiting for the rain to stop in order to die, Aureliano Segundo gathered his belongings and returned home.</t5532> <t5533>As he passed through the streets, he saw the residents of Macondo sitting with their arms crossed in front of their windows, their eyes lost in thought, watching the relentless and merciless passage of time.</t5533>
<t5534>Since nothing could be done beyond watching the rain, there was no need to divide time into months and years.</t5534> <t5535>The children welcomed Aureliano Segundo with joy because he played his hoarse accordion and entertained them.</t5535> <t5536>But what they really enjoyed more than these concerts was looking at the encyclopedia.</t5536> <t5537>They gathered again in Meme's room and began to listen to Aureliano's stories, which turned his flying balloon into a flying elephant searching for a place to sleep among the clouds.</t5537> <t5538>While Aureliano Segundo was flipping through the encyclopedia, he came across a picture of a man on horseback.</t5538> <t5539>Despite his strange attire, the man did not seem unfamiliar at all.</t5539>
<t5540>After carefully examining it, Aureliano Segundo concluded that it was a portrait of Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t5540> <t5541>He showed the portrait to Fernanda.</t5541> <t5542>She also agreed that the man on the horse resembled not only the colonel but the entire family.</t5542>
<t5543>Yet in fact, it was a Tatar warrior in the picture.</t5543> <t5544>Time was passing by looking at the pictures of the Rhodes statue and the snake charmers.</t5544> <t5545>One day, his wife came into the room and informed Aureliano Segundo that there was only one and a half kilos of dried meat and a sack of rice left in the granary.</t5545>
<t5546>Aureliano Segundo asked, "Well, what do you want me to do?"</t5546>
<t5547>Fernanda said, "I don't know about that."</t5547> <t5548>"That's something for men to know."</t5548>
<t5549>Aureliano Segundo said, "We'll think of a solution when the weather clears up."</t5549>
<t5550>Even if he had to eat a bite of meat with a spoonful of rice, the encyclopedia interested him more than the problems of the house.</t5550>
<t5551>"I can't do anything right now," he was saying, "this rain won't last until the end of our lives."</t5551> <t5552>As the sacks in the pantry reached their bottoms, Fernanda's anger was reaching its peak.</t5552> <t5553>When her complaints and grumblings proved useless, one morning, all her anger broke loose and her speech, which started in a monotone like the monotonous strumming of a guitar, rose and rose as the hours passed.</t5553> <t5554>Aureliano Segundo only became aware of the situation the next morning after breakfast, when he was disturbed by the buzzing that drowned out the sound of the rain and was more fluid than it.</t5554> <t5555>The irritating buzzing was coming from Fernanda.</t5555> <t5556>She was wandering around the house, saying that she had been raised to be a queen, but in the end, she had become a servant in this madhouse, and while she was exhausting herself to keep this crumbling house standing, her lazy, debauched, immoral husband was lying on his back waiting for bread to rain down from the sky.</t5556>
<t5557>There was a heap of work to be done, she had reached her limit, she couldn't bear it anymore, from dawn to nightfall there were a myriad of things to repair and do, and when she went to bed at night, her eyes would sting from exhaustion, yet not a single soul would come up to her and ask -Good morning Fernanda, how are you, did you sleep well?</t5557> <t5558>No one even asked out of courtesy why she was so pale and wan, or why there were dark circles around her eyes when she got up in the morning.</t5558> <t5559>What more could be expected from this family who always saw her as a nuisance, a fool, and whispered behind her back?</t5559> <t5560>They mocked her, called her a church mouse, a prude, a know-it-all, a fraud.</t5560> <t5561>God forgive her sins, even Amaranta had said she was someone who stirred up her own mess, God forbid, she had uttered those words.</t5561> <t5562>Fernanda, because she had the fear of God in her heart, endured all this, but when that scoundrel Jose Arcadio Segundo said that the family had been doomed ever since this constipated woman, this conceited highlander, set foot in their house, she couldn't take it anymore.</t5562>
<t5563>God help us, what kind of words were these, she had said that she was a girl born from the seed of the highlanders sent by the government to kill workers, and she had said these words to her, to herself, who was the godchild of the Duke of Alba.</t5563>
<t5564>She was the daughter of such a noble family that the wives of the presidents were terrified when they heard of her lineage.</t5564> <t5565>They were going to insult a lady like her, a lady who carried noble blood in her veins, who had the right to line up eleven names in a row when signing her name, and who was the only one in this town full of ruffians who didn't lose her composure when she saw sixteen pieces of silver cutlery together!</t5565>
<t5566>Her husband, that filthy womanizer, would make fun of her, saying that so many forks and knives would be of no use to people, and that at most, centipedes would use them, and he would have a good laugh!</t5566> <t5567>There was no one else who knew, with eyes closed, when and from which side and with which glass white wine should be served, and when and from which side and with which glass red wine should be served.</t5567>
<t5568>That peasant who thought white wine should be drunk during the day and red wine at night -may God forgive his sins- was he like Amaranta?</t5568> <t5569>Who else in the whole coastal region had pissed in a golden chamber pot?</t5569> <t5570>Yet, -may God forgive his sins- Colonel Aureliano Buendia, with his Masonic head, had confronted him, mocking him by asking where he got that right, or if he shat basil instead of shit -yes, with those exact words.</t5570> <t5571>Upon this, Renata, his own daughter, who had secretly seen the chamber pot in his room, said that even if the pot was solid gold and had a crest on it, what was inside was the same old shit, and the worst kind because it was the shit of constipated highlanders.</t5571> <t5572>Think about it, if a man's own daughter spoke like that, what could be expected from the other members of the family?</t5572> <t5573>But no matter what, it was her right to expect her husband to be a bit more considerate, a bit more respectful.</t5573> <t5574>After all, by God's command, he was her husband, her spouse, the man who legally claimed her property.</t5574> <t5575>He had come to her father's house to take her, so he should have willingly taken on this responsibility.</t5575>
<t5576>In her father's house, she lacked nothing; she had everything she could eat in front of her, and what she didn't eat was behind her. She never had to lift a finger; her godfather had only sent a letter in a sealed envelope with his signet ring pressed into the wax, asking that his dear goddaughter's delicate hands not be injured by any work other than playing the piano.</t5576> <t5577>To kill time, she would weave funeral wreaths.</t5577> <t5578>However, that lunatic who was to be her husband had brought her from her home by making countless promises and assurances, bringing her to this hellish place where one could hardly breathe from the heat. Before she could even complete her fast, her husband had packed his trunk, taken his accordion, and gone to the arms of a despicable woman.</t5578> <t5579>According to what people said, to understand what kind of woman she was, it was enough to look at her from behind and see how she swayed her hips like a wild mare.</t5579> <t5580>That woman was a...</t5580> <t5581>she was something else entirely, the complete opposite of herself. Whether in a palace or a pigsty, she never lost her ladylike demeanor, remaining a lady both at the table and in bed. She was well-bred, knew what the fear of God was, and submitted to God's laws—everything that she herself was not.</t5581>
<t5582>Of course, her husband couldn't perform the acrobatics and reckless antics he did with the other woman with her.</t5582> <t5583>The other woman, like French courtesans, was ready for anything.</t5583> <t5584>She was even worse than them.</t5584> <t5585>At least they had the decency to hang a red lantern on their doors.</t5585>
<t5586>This was the behavior that Dona Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio deemed worthy of their one and only beloved daughter.</t5586> <t5587>Yet her father was such a respectable man.</t5587>
<t5588>He was a devout Christian, a knight who had received the holy tomb insignia.</t5588> <t5589>Those who received this insignia, by the grace of God, would lie in their graves uncorrupted, their cheeks as fresh as a bride's, and their eyes as clear as emeralds.</t5589>
<t5590>Aureliano Segundo cut off his wife, "Now you're exaggerating. When they brought him here, your father was already starting to smell."</t5590>
<t5591>Watching for the moment when the woman would be off guard; he had listened to her patiently for a whole day.</t5591> <t5592>Although Fernanda did not pay attention to what he said, she lowered her voice.</t5592> <t5593>That evening at dinner, Fernanda's constant nagging drowned out the sound of the rain.</t5593> <t5594>Aureliano Segundo, without lifting his head from his plate, took a few bites and retired to his room early.</t5594> <t5595>The next morning at breakfast, Fernanda was exhausted.</t5595>
<t5596>He seemed not to have slept and appeared to be worn out from his own anger.</t5596> <t5597>Nevertheless, when her husband asked for a soft-boiled egg, instead of saying that the eggs had run out a week ago, Fernanda opened her mouth and closed her eyes, berating men whose minds were in their stomachs, complaining that they sat idly by and then demanded the moon when they came to the table.</t5597>
<t5598>Aureliano Segundo, as usual, took the children and withdrew to the room to look at the encyclopedia.</t5598> <t5599>So that Fernanda could continue to nag him, she pretended to tidy up Meme's room.</t5599> <t5600>While she was grumbling there, it took courage for Aureliano Segundo to open the encyclopedia for the children and say that they had printed a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendia.</t5600>
<t5601>In the afternoon, after the children went to sleep, Aureliano Segundo went out to the veranda.</t5601>
<t5602>Fernanda did not give up, stepping on his branch, clinging to him with her nagging that resembled the buzz of a horsefly.</t5602> <t5603>Even though there was nothing left to eat at home but stones, she kept saying that her husband was lounging around like a Persian shah, watching the rain, and that he was useless anyway.</t5603>
<t5604>He was a wretch, only knew how to exploit like a sponge, was useless, had a softer disposition than cotton, was accustomed to living off women, did he think he was married to the wife of the Prophet Jonah who amused himself by listening to whale stories?</t5604> <t5605>Aureliano Segundo, as if he hadn't heard a word, listened to his wife for more than two hours without losing his composure.</t5605> <t5606>Towards evening, he didn't interrupt his wife until he could no longer bear the incessant noise in his head, like a drum beating.</t5606>
<t5607>Then, he politely requested, "Please stop now."</t5607>
<t5608>Fernanda, on the contrary, raised her voice.</t5608> <t5609>"Why should I cut it?" she said.</t5609>
<t5610>Those who don't want to listen to me can leave and go somewhere else.</t5610> <t5611>Then Aureliano Segundo lost control of himself.</t5611> <t5612>He slowly stood up.</t5612> <t5613>He had an indifference as if he was getting up to stretch.</t5613> <t5614>Then, with an extremely methodical and orderly rage, he grabbed the begonia pots, the fern barrels, and the hydrangea pots one by one and smashed them on the ground.</t5614> <t5615>Fernanda was scared.</t5615> <t5616>Because she hadn't really understood the tension caused by the nagging she had maintained until that moment.</t5616>
<t5617>Now it was far too late to calm things down and fix the situation.</t5617> <t5618>In the drunkenness brought on by this release, Aureliano Segundo, still not hurrying at all, broke the glass of the cabinet where the porcelain sets were kept, took out the porcelains one by one, and smashed them on the floor.</t5618> <t5619>Just as he had once covered the house from top to bottom with banknotes, with the same calmness and systematic work, he now began to throw the Bohemian crystals against the wall.</t5619> <t5620>Then he shattered everything that could be broken, from hand-painted vases, pictures of young girls in flowered boats, gilded framed mirrors, in short, everything from the living room to the pantry; finally, he threw the large jar in the kitchen into the garden.</t5620> <t5621>The jar shattered in the middle of the garden with a hollow explosion.</t5621> <t5622>Then Aureliano Segundo washed his hands, pulled the oilcloth over his head, and left.</t5622> <t5623>Before midnight, he returned with a few bundles of dried meat, a few bags of rice, worm-eaten corn, and a couple of bunches of rotten bananas.</t5623> <t5624>After that, there was never a shortage of food in the house.</t5624>
<t5625>Amaranta Ursula and little Aureliano would always remember their rainy days as a happy period.</t5625> <t5626>Despite all of Fernanda's strictness, the children would dive into and out of the puddles in the garden, catch lizards and cut them, and when Santa Sofia de la Piedad turned her back, they would play a game of supposedly poisoning the soup by adding the dust from butterfly wings.</t5626> <t5627>Their main entertainment was Ursula.</t5627> <t5628>The children saw her as a big, unbreakable doll, wrapping her in colorful blankets, painting her face with soot and coal, and carrying her from place to place.</t5628> <t5629>Once, just like they did with the frogs, they almost gouged out Ursula's eyes with the gardener's shears.</t5629> <t5630>Nothing amused them as much as Ursula's ramblings.</t5630> <t5631>In the third year of the rain, Ursula's brain really started to soften.</t5631> <t5632>She was gradually losing her grasp on reality, mixing up today and yesterday.</t5632> <t5633>She saw events from her distant past as if they had just happened.</t5633> <t5634>Once, she even cried non-stop for three days because she thought her great-grandmother Petronila Iguaran, who had been dead for over a century, had just died.</t5634>
<t5635>His mind became so confused that he began to think of little Aureliano as his own son, the colonel, and to see him as if he were at the age when he went to see ice with his father.</t5635> <t5636>At that time, he also thought of Jose Arcadio, who was studying at the seminary, as his eldest son who had run away with the gypsies.</t5636> <t5637>He constantly talked about the family, listing all the relatives.</t5637> <t5638>Eventually, the children learned to dream of being together not only with relatives who had died long ago but also with people who had lived at different times.</t5638> <t5639>Ursula, with ashes sprinkled in her hair and a red scarf tied around her face, would sit on her bed and listen with pleasure as the children vividly described these unreal relatives as if they had seen them with their own eyes.</t5639> <t5640>Ursula would talk about events that had happened long before she was born, rejoice in the good news they brought, and weep with them over the deaths of people who had lived long after the times of these imaginary guests.</t5640>
<t5641>Not long after, a situation that caught the children's attention occurred.</t5641> <t5642>Ursula had a question that she directed to each of the people she imagined, one by one.</t5642> <t5643>She was investigating who had brought the life-sized statue of Saint Joseph into the house to keep it there until the rains stopped.</t5643> <t5644>Thus, the buried treasure, known only to Ursula, came to Aureliano Segundo's mind.</t5644> <t5645>However, no matter how roundabout his questions were, no matter how much he tried to coax her, he couldn't make the woman talk.</t5645> <t5646>Despite all her confusion, Ursula still retained the awareness to not reveal the secret of the buried gold to anyone other than its true owner.</t5646> <t5647>She was so strict and cunning on this matter that when Aureliano Segundo tried to pass off one of his friends as the owner of the gold, Ursula bewildered the man with her questions, making him look ridiculous.</t5647>
<t5648>After concluding that Aureliano Segundo would definitely take Ursula's secret to the grave, he hired a bunch of workers under the pretext of digging water channels in the front and back yards and started having the garden excavated.</t5648>
<t5649>He himself took iron rods and various types of metal detectors in hand and examined the soil.</t5649> <t5650>Despite their exhaustive efforts for three months, they found nothing resembling gold.</t5650> <t5651>Upon this, Aureliano Segundo, thinking that playing cards might be more useful than the workers, went to Pilar Ternera.</t5651> <t5652>However, Pilar said that unless Ursula cut the cards, they would not reach a conclusion.</t5652> <t5653>At the same time, not hesitating to specify the treasure down to the last penny, she stated that there were exactly seven thousand two hundred and fourteen gold coins in three sacks tied with copper wire; and that the sacks were buried within a circle with a radius of one hundred meters, centered on Ursula's bed.</t5653> <t5654>For this treasure to be found, the rains had to stop and the sun of three consecutive Junes had to dry the piles of mud and turn them into dust.</t5654>
<t5655>Aureliano Segundo, who compared the roundness and ambiguity of the fortune teller's words to those of the spirit summoners, preferred to continue the excavations despite being in August and needing to wait at least three years for the fortune to come true.</t5655> <t5656>The first thing that surprised and confused him was that the distance between Ursula's bed and the back garden wall was exactly three hundred meters.</t5656> <t5657>When Fernanda saw her husband meticulously measuring the garden and heard him telling the workers to dig the channels one meter deeper, she believed that he, like his twin brother, was also a madman.</t5657> <t5658>However, Aureliano Segundo, who was caught up in a passion for research comparable to the effort his great-grandfather showed while searching for a path, melted the last of the fat layers he had accumulated in this endeavor.</t5658> <t5659>He began to resemble his twin brother again as before.</t5659> <t5660>This resemblance came not only from his thinning but also from adopting a pensive and introverted demeanor like his brother.</t5660> <t5661>He no longer dealt with the children.</t5661> <t5662>He wandered around covered in mud from head to toe, snacking in the kitchen corner whenever he felt like it, and only answered Santa Sofia de la Piedad's questions once in a blue moon.</t5662> <t5663>Seeing her husband working so hard, Fernanda, who thought he was incapable of doing any work, attributed his sullenness to deprivation and fatigue, his silence to asceticism, and his stubbornness to a resilient faith, feeling regret for having scolded him as a loafer all this time.</t5663>
<t5664>However, Aureliano was in no mood to compromise at that time.</t5664> <t5665>He was burying himself in the decayed branches and flowers up to his neck, and after finishing the front and back gardens, he started cleaning the flower beds.</t5665> <t5666>He had dug so deeply under the eastern wing of the house, reaching the foundation, that one night the household, awakened by the shaking of the house and the sounds coming from underground, thought there was an earthquake.</t5666> <t5667>Three of the rooms were collapsing.</t5667> <t5668>A deep crack opened between Fernanda's room and the veranda.</t5668> <t5669>Even though the house was collapsing, Aureliano Segundo did not pause his investigation.</t5669> <t5670>Even when their last hopes were extinguished and the wisest thing seemed to be to wait for what the fortune would say, Aureliano Segundo did not give up.</t5670> <t5671>He repaired the collapsing foundation, filled the crack with mortar, and continued digging along the side of the house towards the west.</t5671> <t5672>In the second week of June the following year, when the rain had lightened, the clouds began to disperse, and the weather was about to clear up, Aureliano Segundo was still digging along the side of the house.</t5672>
<t5673>Indeed, the weather cleared up.</t5673> <t5674>On a Friday at two o'clock, the world was illuminated by a sun as red as brick dust and as cool as water.</t5674> <t5675>After that, it didn't rain for ten years.</t5675>
<t5676>Macondo had turned into ruins.</t5676> <t5677>In the mud-swamped streets, broken furniture and animal skeletons covered with red lilies stood as the last memories of those who left Macondo as crazily as they had come.</t5677> <t5678>The houses hastily built during the banana plague were abandoned.</t5678> <t5679>The Banana Company dismantled its facilities.</t5679> <t5680>All that remained of the old wire-fenced site was a heap of ruins.</t5680>
<t5681>Wooden houses, breezy cool terraces thought for afternoon card parties, had scattered and flown away as if they were the harbinger of the divine hurricane that would erase Macondo from the earth years later.</t5681> <t5682>The only human trace left from that relentless wind was Patricia Brown's glove, found in a car crushed among wild violets.</t5682> <t5683>The magical area discovered by Jose Arcadio Buendia during the town's founding days, and later used for banana plantations, became a swamp covered with decaying roots.</t5683>
<t5684>Even the silent foam of the sea could now be seen on the horizon.</t5684> <t5685>Aureliano Segunda put on his dry clothes and went out into the street on the first Sunday to rediscover the town, feeling great sorrow.</t5685> <t5686>Those who survived the disaster, that is, the Macondolans from before the Banana Company storm, were sitting in the middle of the street, enjoying the first sunny weather.</t5686>
<t5687>The moss green that the rain hit on their faces and the bitter smell of being cornered were still on them, yet the joy of reclaiming the town they were born in warmed their hearts.</t5687>
<t5688>The Turkish Street had regained its old appearance.</t5688> <t5689>In the days when Arabs with sandaled feet and ringed ears traveled the world bartering trinkets with parrots and saw Macondo as a place to pause their age-old wanderings, the Turkish Street was in the same condition as it is now.</t5689> <t5690>The goods that had survived the rain were scattered on the stalls, the fabrics hanging over the doors were moldy in places, the stalls had been gnawed by worms, and the walls were eroded by dampness.</t5690> <t5691>Yet, the Arabs of the third generation, just like their fathers and grandfathers, sat in the same places and in the same manner as their ancestors, indifferent, carefree, and immune to time and disasters.</t5691>
<t5692>Even after the insomnia plague and after Colonel Aureliano Buendía's thirty-two wars, they continued to sit like this, whether alive or dead.</t5692> <t5693>Aureliano Segundo, amazed at their resilience in the face of the collapse and disintegration of the gambling tables, the pita stands, the shooting galleries, and the passage where they interpreted dreams and told fortunes, approached the Arabs with his usual boldness and went door to door asking which mysterious sources they relied on to avoid being swept away by the storm and which devilish inventions they used to avoid drowning.</t5693>
<t5694>The Arabs, laughing slyly and rolling their eyes, gave the same answer in unison: -By swimming.</t5694>
<t5695>Perhaps the only person among the locals who had an Arab heart was Petra Cotes.</t5695>
<t5696>He had watched his barns being razed to the ground, seen his granary collapse in the storm, but he had managed to keep his house standing.</t5696> <t5697>During the second year, he had sent multiple messages to Aureliano Segundo, who replied that he did not know when he would go to his house, but whenever he did, he would bring a chest of gold to lay on the bedroom floors.</t5697><t5698>-</t5698> <t5699>While Petra Cotes was searching her heart for the strength to resist this disaster, she encountered a profound and justified anger deep within and, with that anger, vowed to rebuild the fortune that her lover had squandered and that the deluge had swept away.</t5699> <t5700>Her decision was so resolute that, eight months after Aureliano Segundo received the last message, he went to her house and found her with disheveled hair, a greenish complexion, and skin covered with scabies marks, working feverishly at the table preparing raffle tickets for household items.</t5700>
<t5701>Aureliano Segundo was taken aback when he saw the situation.</t5701> <t5702>When Petra Cotes saw that he was dirty and silent, she thought that the one who came to see her was not her great love, but his twin brother.</t5702>
<t5703>Aureliano Segundo said, "You must be crazy, are you going to put animal bones in the lottery?"</t5703>
<t5704>Then Petra Cotes told him to take a look at the bedroom.</t5704> <t5705>And Aureliano Segundo saw the mule.</t5705> <t5706>It was just as skin and bones as its mistress, but it still looked as lively and determined as she did.</t5706> <t5707>Petra Cotes had fed the mule with her own wrath, and when the hay, corn, and dry stalks ran out, she brought it into her bedroom and fed it with those crisp linen sheets, Persian carpets, fringed bedspreads, velvet curtains, and the silk canopy with gold embroidery over the bed.</t5707>
<t5708>Ursula had to make a great effort to fulfill the promise she made when the weather improved.</t5708> <t5709>In August, with the dry wind that began to blow, wilting the rose bushes, hardening the mud piles like stone, and raising angry dust clouds that would never lift from the rusty zinc roofs and century-old almond trees, Ursula's waves of consciousness, which had thinned during the rains, increased, and she began to gather her wits.</t5709>
<t5710>When Ursula realized that she had been the children's toy for more than three years, she raised hell, started cursing and swearing.</t5710> <t5711>She washed her face, threw off the colorful pieces of fabric on her back, discarded the dried lizards, frogs, amulets, and Arab necklaces that the children had attached here and there, and for the first time since Amaranta's death, she got out of bed without asking for anyone's help and joined the household.</t5711>
<t5712>His heart never faltered, it guided him in the dark.</t5712> <t5713>Those who saw him stumble or those who bumped into his arm, which he always kept at head level, thought there was something wrong with Ursula's body, never considering that he might be blind.</t5713>
<t5714>After the first repair of the house, it wasn't necessary for Ursula to see to understand that the carefully tended flower beds had been ruined by the rain, then overturned by Aureliano Segundo's excavations; that the walls and floor cements had cracked, the furniture had aged and faded, the doors had come off their hinges, and that the whole family had, with a despair unimaginable in her youth, let everything go to ruin.</t5714>
<t5715>While wandering through the empty bedrooms with her cane, she could hear the constant ticking of the wood-eating worms, the rustling of the moths in the wardrobes, and the nerve-wracking noise of the huge red ants that had emerged during the flood and were gnawing at the house's foundations.</t5715> <t5716>One day, she opened the chest where the saint statues were kept, then called Santa Sofia de la Piedad and told her to clean out the cockroaches that had shredded the clothes in the chest and swarmed over her as soon as the lid was opened.</t5716> <t5717>"A person cannot live in such neglect," she said.</t5717> <t5718>"If this continues, we will become food for the animals."</t5718>
<t5719>From that moment on, Ursula did not stop for a moment.</t5719> <t5720>She would wake up before dawn and put anyone she could catch, whether child or adult, to work.</t5720> <t5721>She laid out the few usable clothes in the sun and eradicated the cockroaches with various insecticides.</t5721>
<t5722>He plugged the wormholes in the doors and windows and the ant nests with quicklime.</t5722> <t5723>This repair frenzy eventually brought Ursula to the forgotten rooms.</t5723> <t5724>She removed the cobwebs from the room where Jose Arcadio Buendia lost his mind over alchemy, cleaned its filth; she straightened the silver workshop that the soldiers had ransacked, and finally, to understand the state of the room, she asked for the keys to Melquiades' room.</t5724> <t5725>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, trying to comply with Jose Arcadio Segundo's wish that no one enter the room until it was certain he was dead, went to great lengths to deceive Ursula.</t5725> <t5726>However, since Ursula was determined not to surrender even the farthest corners of the house to an invasion of insects, she overcame all the obstacles put in her way.</t5726> <t5727>After insisting for three days, she finally managed to get the door opened.</t5727> <t5728>When the door opened, she had to hold onto it to avoid fainting from the stench that hit her face.</t5728> <t5729>It took her only two seconds to remember that the seventy-two chairs bought for the girls coming from school were there and that the soldiers who raided the house on a rainy night did not find Jose Arcadio Segundo.</t5729>
<t5730>As if he were seeing everything, he cried out, "May God have mercy on us!"</t5730> <t5731>"We put in so much effort to discipline you, and in the end, you live in filth like pigs, is this acceptable?"</t5731>
<t5732>Jose Arcadio Segundo was reading the manuscripts.</t5732> <t5733>The only distinguishable things on his face, which was covered in hair, were his motionless eyes and his teeth, which had turned green at the roots.</t5733> <t5734>When Jose Arcadio Segundo recognized his great-grandmother's voice, he turned his head towards the door, tried to smile, and unknowingly repeated an old saying of Ursula's.</t5734>
<t5735>"What were you expecting?" he murmured.</t5735> <t5736>"Time is passing by."</t5736>
<t5737>Ursula said, "Yes, it is."</t5737> <t5738>"But it doesn't pass quickly either."</t5738>
<t5739>As soon as he said it, he realized that he had repeated the words of Colonel Aureliano Buendia in his execution cell, and as he had said, he couldn't help but shudder at this moment, which proved that time did not pass but circled around in a loop.</t5739> <t5740>But even at that moment, he didn't let himself go, scolded Jose Segundo like a child, told him to wash up and shave, and to help with the house repairs.</t5740>
<t5741>The idea of leaving the room that had brought him peace horrified Jose Arcadio Segundo.</t5741> <t5742>He shouted that no human being had the power to make him leave the room, that he did not want to see the two hundred-car train loaded with corpses departing from Macondo every evening.</t5742> <t5743>"Everyone at the station was on the train," he shouted.</t5743> <t5744>"There were exactly three thousand four hundred and eight of them."</t5744> <t5745>It was only then that Ursula realized he was living in a more insurmountable world of shadows than her own, an unreachable and desolate realm like that of his great-grandfather.</t5745>
<t5746>Ursula left Jose Arcadio Segundo in the room without bothering him.</t5746> <t5747>But she did not have a lock installed.</t5747> <t5748>She kept one of the chairs and had the others removed.</t5748> <t5749>She started having the room cleaned every day.</t5749> <t5750>She tried to keep Jose Arcadio Segundo as clean and presentable as during his great-grandfather's long captivity under the chestnut tree.</t5750> <t5751>At first, Fernanda interpreted this intense activity as a result of senility and struggled to hide her weariness and frustration.</t5751> <t5752>It was around that time that Jose Arcadio wrote that he would come to Macondo from Rome before taking his priestly vows.</t5752> <t5753>This time, Fernanda gathered her skirt around her waist.</t5753> <t5754>She was at a loss about what to do to prevent her son from seeing the house as gloomy, sometimes watering the flowers four times a day.</t5754> <t5755>With the same concerns, she sped up her correspondence with the invisible doctors and restored the ferns, begonias, and hydrangeas that Aureliano Segundo's destructive rage had scattered, even before Ursula noticed the pots were out of place.</t5755> <t5756>Then she sold the silverware and replaced it with ceramic plates, tin bowls, iron spoons, and cotton tablecloths.</t5756> <t5757>Thus, the sideboards, accustomed to the porcelain of the India company and Bohemian crystals, were left forlorn.</t5757>
<t5758>Ursula was always looking to take things one step further.</t5758> <t5759>"Open the windows and doors," she shouted, "Cook some meat and fish, get the largest turtles you can find, let strangers come and sprawl in every corner they find, let them pee at the base of the rose bushes, let them eat as much as they want, let them stain and muddy everything with their boots, let them do whatever they want to us, only then can we stop the ruin," she said.</t5759> <t5760>It was an empty dream.</t5760> <t5761>Ursula was now excessively old and could no longer repeat the miracle of the animal-shaped candies.</t5761> <t5762>None of her children or grandchildren had inherited her strength.</t5762> <t5763>In the end, Fernanda's words came true and the house remained closed.</t5763>
<t5764>Aureliano Segundo, who had moved his trunks back to Petra Cotes' house, could only find time to take care of his family just enough to keep them from starving.</t5764> <t5765>With the money they obtained by putting the mule in the lottery, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo bought a few more heads of cattle and established a primitive lottery system.</t5765>
<t5766>Aureliano Segundo went door to door selling tickets that he had colored with ink to make them look more appealing and convincing, and he perhaps did not realize that many people bought tickets out of an old sense of gratitude or simply out of pity.</t5766> <t5767>Undoubtedly, even a buyer driven by a sense of pity did not forget that by spending twenty cents, they had a chance to win a pig, and by spending thirty-two cents, they could win a cow.</t5767>
<t5768>They became so invested in this matter that Petra Cotes' garden started to be packed on Tuesday nights.</t5768>
<t5769>Everyone eagerly awaited the moment when a child randomly selected from the crowd would draw the tickets from the bag.</t5769> <t5770>Soon, these Tuesday draws took on the appearance of a weekly fair.</t5770> <t5771>As night fell, food and drink stalls were set up in the garden.</t5771> <t5772>Most of the winners, on the condition that someone else would buy drinks and play music, would immediately slaughter and roast the animals they had won right there on the spot.</t5772>
<t5773>Thus, without understanding how it happened, Aureliano Segundo found himself once again in the midst of festivities with an accordion in his hand.</t5773>
<t5774>These gatherings, which were humble copies of the festivities of old days, proved to Aureliano Segundo how much he had lost his former cheerfulness and how his skill in organizing entertainment had become bland.</t5774> <t5775>He had become a completely different man.</t5775> <t5776>His one hundred and twenty-kilogram body from the days when he challenged the elephant had dropped to seventy-five kilograms, and his swollen, red face that resembled a turtle had wrinkled like iguana skin.</t5776> <t5777>He would quickly get bored and tired easily.</t5777> <t5778>However, in Petra Cotes' eyes, he had never been as unique a person as he was in those days.</t5778>
<t5779>Perhaps the feeling of pity the woman felt was mixed with love, or perhaps the sense of loneliness and helplessness that poverty had made them both experience was bringing them closer.</t5779> <t5780>The broken bed had ceased to be a scene of wild lovemaking and had become a warm refuge.</t5780> <t5781>In the room stripped of the mirrors lined up for sale to buy lottery animals and the silks and velvets devoured by the mule, they sat up late like sleepless grandmothers and grandfathers, valuing their sleepless nights by keeping accounts and adding up the pennies they once squandered for pleasure.</t5781> <t5782>Sometimes the crowing of roosters caught them while they were stacking money.</t5782> <t5783>They would take a little from one of the money towers they had stacked and add it to another, calculating that this much would be enough to keep Fernanda's mouth shut, this much would buy shoes for Amaranta Ursula, with this they could buy clothes for Santa Sofia de la Piedad who hadn't worn anything new since all the commotion, this would be Ursula's coffin money if she died, this was the coffee money that increased by two cents per kilo every three months, this was the sugar share that tasted less every day, with this they could buy lumber that hadn't dried yet after the rain, and this would be the money for the paper and colored ink needed to make tickets.</t5783> <t5784>The rest, after all the tickets were sold, would be the consolation prize for the lottery winner because the week's prize calf turned out to be scrawny and they were left with nothing but the animal's hide.</t5784>
<t5785>These modest accounts were so free from ulterior motives that they almost always allocated the largest share to Fernanda, not because they wanted to silence their consciences or because they pitied her, but because her comfort was more important to them than their own.</t5785> <t5786>In fact, without realizing it, both of them had started to see Fernanda as the daughter they had always wanted but could never have.</t5786> <t5787>Once, just so Fernanda could buy a Dutch tablecloth, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo ate nothing but dry bread for three days.</t5787> <t5788>No matter what they did, no matter how hard they tried, no matter how many pennies they managed to save, they never heard the words "Go ahead, my servant," and they could only barely stay afloat by spending their savings little by little.</t5788>
<t5789>On the days when accounts reached an impasse, they were deeply pondering how the world had changed so much, why animals no longer reproduced as they used to, why money slipped through their fingers, and why those who recently lit bonfires with banknotes for fun now considered it robbery to ask for twelve cents for a lottery ticket worth six chickens.</t5789> <t5790>Aureliano Segundo thought that the evil was not in the world but in Petra Cotes' heart, that the animals became infertile and money lost its value because of a change in the woman's heart during the deluge, but he couldn't reveal this.</t5790> <t5791>Consumed by this suspicion, Aureliano Segundo began to scrutinize the woman's feelings; he delved so deep that, while seeking interest, he found love.</t5791> <t5792>Because while trying to make the woman love him, he ended up falling in love with her.</t5792>
<t5793>As Petra Cotes saw Aureliano Segundo's love growing, she began to love him more and more, and in the autumn of her life, she started to believe once again that when two hearts unite, even a barn can become a paradise.</t5793> <t5794>Both of them began to view their past excesses, that vast fortune, and their unrestrained lovemaking as unnecessary and troublesome, and they regretted wasting so many years of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude.</t5794> <t5795>After living for years in a barren chaos, they began to savor the miracle of being madly in love and being able to love each other as much at the table as in bed.</t5795> <t5796>They became so happy that even when they were like two worn-out ping-pong balls, they did not stop rejoicing like children and playing like puppy dogs.</t5796>
<t5797>The lottery was not very profitable.</t5797> <t5798>At first, Aureliano Segundo would lock himself in the room that had once been the farm's office for three days a week, cut the tickets, and draw pictures on them that were not too amateurish: a red cow, a green pig, or a few blue chickens, according to the animal featured in that week's lottery.</t5798>
<t5799>Then, with great care, he would put the numbers on the tickets with handwriting that he tried to make resemble printing press letters, and he would write "Divine Providence Lottery," which was Petra Cotes' invention.</t5799> <t5800>But as he began to get very tired over time, he had rubber stamps made with pictures of animals, the ticket numbers, and the name of the lottery on them.</t5800> <t5801>Now, his only task was to press the stamps, in various colors, onto the papers.</t5801> <t5802>In the last years of his life, he thought of putting puzzles on the tickets instead of numbering them.</t5802>
<t5803>Thus, the gift could be shared among those who correctly solved the puzzle.</t5803>
<t5804>However, because this system was both very complex and aroused suspicion, Aureliano Segundo abandoned this endeavor after the second attempt.</t5804>
<t5805>Aureliano Segundo was working tirelessly to maintain the reputation and popularity of his lottery, so much so that he didn't even have time to see his children.</t5805> <t5806>Fernanda enrolled Amaranta Ursula in a private school that only accepted six girl students.</t5806> <t5807>However, she did not send Aureliano to a public school.</t5807> <t5808>She thought they had already gone too far by allowing him to leave the room.</t5808> <t5809>Moreover, at that time, schools only accepted children born from legal Catholic marriages.</t5809> <t5810>However, when they brought Aureliano home, the identification card attached to him indicated that he was a foundling.</t5810> <t5811>Thus, the child began to grow up in the narrow world of the house, between the affectionate eyes of Santa Sofia de la Piedad and the senility of Ursula, learning from his grandmothers.</t5811> <t5812>He was a thin, delicate child.</t5812> <t5813>He would ask questions with a curiosity that drove adults crazy: Unlike the colonel, who was a keen observer and could make predictions with intuition at his age, Aureliano was a mischievous child with somewhat surprising habits.</t5813>
<t5814>When Amaranta Ursula went to school, Aureliano would play in the garden, hunt worms, and torture insects in a thousand different ways.</t5814> <t5815>Once, Fernanda caught him collecting scorpions to put in Ursula's bed.</t5815> <t5816>She immediately locked him up in Meme's old room.</t5816>
<t5817>Aureliano began to spend his lonely hours at home looking at the pictures in the encyclopedia.</t5817> <t5818>One day, while Ursula was walking around the house sprinkling a bunch of nettles with distilled water, she found Aureliano in the room and, despite having been together many times, she still asked who he was.</t5818>
<t5819>The child said, "I am Aureliano Buendia."</t5819>
<t5820>Ursula replied, "Yes, you are."</t5820> <t5821>"It's time to learn silversmithing."</t5821>
<t5822>She was confusing him with her own son again.</t5822> <t5823>Because the warm wind that blew after the flood and occasionally illuminated Ursula's mind had ceased.</t5823> <t5824>Ursula had now completely lost her consciousness.</t5824> <t5825>Whenever she entered the bedroom, she found Petronila Iguaran with her beaded jacket and hoop skirt that she wore when going out for a walk; her grandmother Tranquilina Marina Miniata Alacoque Buendia sitting in the rocking cripple chair, fanning herself with a peacock feather fan; her great-grandfather Aureliano Arcadio Buendia with his make-believe Dolaman robe from his sensitive officer days; her father Aureliano Iguaran, who had found a prayer that dried up wolves and made cows fall; her cousin with a pig's tail; Jose Arcadio Buendia and her deceased sons sitting on chairs lined up along the wall.</t5825> <t5826>All these relatives seemed to have come not to see her, but to keep vigil over a dead person.</t5826> <t5827>Ursula tried to bring up cheerful topics, talking to them by recounting events from very different times and various places.</t5827>
<t5828>When Amaranta Ursula returned from school and Aureliano grew tired of the encyclopedia, they would find Ursula sitting on her bed, lost in the maze of the dead, talking to herself.</t5828> <t5829>Once, in a fit of terror, she screamed -Fire! and chaos ensued.</t5829> <t5830>However, Ursula was talking about a barn fire she had seen when she was four years old.</t5830> <t5831>She mixed up the past and the present so much that, in the few moments of clarity before her death, no one could tell if she was recounting what she had heard or what she remembered.</t5831> <t5832>Ursula was slowly withering away, becoming like a child.</t5832>
<t5833>In her final months, she turned into a cherry pit lost in her nightgown.</t5833> <t5834>The arm she always kept in the air resembled a monkey's paw.</t5834> <t5835>She lay still for several days.</t5835> <t5836>Santa Sofia de la Piedad had to shake her to see if she was still alive, then sat her on her lap and poured a few spoonfuls of sugary water into her mouth.</t5836>
<t5837>Ursula looked like an old woman who had just been born.</t5837> <t5838>Amaranta, Ursula, and Aureliano would carry her around in their arms, lay her on the altar to measure her height, wondering if she was bigger than the statue of the child Jesus.</t5838> <t5839>One day, they put her in a cupboard in the pantry.</t5839> <t5840>The poor woman was almost eaten by the rats.</t5840> <t5841>On the Sunday before Easter, while Fernanda was at church, the children entered Ursula's bedroom, grabbed her by the neck and ankles, and carried her outside.</t5841>
<t5842>Amaranta Ursula, "Oh, my poor great-grandmother," she cried out.</t5842> <t5843>"She died of old age."</t5843>
<t5844>Ursula shuddered, "I am not dead, I am alive!" she said.</t5844>
<t5845>Amaranta Ursula, trying hard to hold back her laughter, said, "Look, look, he's not even breathing."</t5845>
<t5846>Ursula shouted, "Look, I'm talking!"</t5846>
<t5847>Aureliano Segundo exclaimed: "He can't even speak."</t5847> <t5848>"The poor thing died just like a grasshopper."</t5848>
<t5849>In the face of so much evidence, Ursula gave up resisting.</t5849> <t5850>Slowly, she said, "Oh my God."</t5850> <t5851>"So this is what it's like to die."</t5851> <t5852>Then she began an uninterrupted prayer that lasted more than two days.</t5852> <t5853>She got carried away and by Tuesday, the prayer was no longer a prayer.</t5853> <t5854>From time to time, she murmured her requests to God, sometimes offering practical solutions to prevent the red ants from destroying the house, asking not to extinguish the lamp illuminating Remedios' picture, babbling that the Buendias should not marry those of the same blood, otherwise their children would have pig tails.</t5854> <t5855>Aureliano Segundo took advantage of Ursula's babblings to learn the location of the gold, but once again came up empty-handed.</t5855> <t5856>Ursula said, "When the rightful owner of the gold appears, God will reveal the location of the treasure to him."</t5856>
<t5857>Santa Sofia de la Piedad had no doubt that Ursula could die at any moment, because in those days there was a disturbance in nature: Roses smelled like marigolds, peas were drying up and falling off, and the scattered bush beans were laid out in an extremely orderly starflower pattern.</t5857>
<t5858>As if these weren't enough, one night Santa Sofia de la Piedad also saw bright orange flying saucers passing through the sky.</t5858>
<t5859>On the Friday morning before Easter, they found Ursula dead.</t5859> <t5860>During the Banana Company era, when they last calculated Ursula's age, they concluded that she was between one hundred fifteen and one hundred twenty-two years old.</t5860> <t5861>They placed Ursula in a coffin not much larger than the basket in which Aureliano had been brought home.</t5861> <t5862>There were very few people at the funeral.</t5862>
<t5863>There were very few people left who remembered him, and the day of the funeral was so hot that birds were crashing into walls like targets thrown into the air during shooting practice, piercing through window screens and dying in bedrooms.</t5863>
<t5864>At first, everyone thought there was an epidemic.</t5864> <t5865>Housewives, especially during nap times, got tired of sweeping up dead birds and collecting them in dustpans, and men got tired of loading the dead birds into wheelbarrows and dumping them into the river.</t5865> <t5866>On Easter day, while giving a sermon, the hundred-year-old Father Antonio Isabel said that the death of the birds was caused by the evil spirit of the Wandering Jew, and that he had seen the Wandering Jew the night before.</t5866>
<t5867>He described the rogue Jew as a creature between a heretic woman and a goat, resembling a hellish beast that burns the air with its breath, and causing new brides to give birth to monsters with his gaze.</t5867> <t5868>All the townspeople did not take his words seriously because they believed the priest had become senile and was talking nonsense.</t5868>
<t5869>However, at dawn on Wednesday, a woman raised the town to its feet with her screams.</t5869> <t5870>She claimed to have seen the footprints of a cloven-hoofed and bipedal creature.</t5870> <t5871>The tracks were so distinct that those who saw them believed in the existence of the terrifying creature described by the priest and began working together to set traps in their gardens.</t5871> <t5872>And that’s how they caught it.</t5872> <t5873>Two weeks after Ursula's death, Petra Cotes and Aureliano Segundo were startled awake by the bellowing of a cow coming from nearby.</t5873> <t5874>When they went to the source of the sound, they found a few people prodding the trapped creature, which was covered with dry leaves, out with sharp sticks.</t5874>
<t5875>The monster, though as big as a young bull, was as heavy as an ox.</t5875> <t5876>A greasy, green liquid was oozing from its wounds.</t5876> <t5877>Its body was covered with coarse hair and clusters of ticks here and there.</t5877> <t5878>Its skin had thickened with an armor resembling fish scales.</t5878>
<t5879>Contrary to what the priest said, his body parts that resembled a human were more akin to a delicate angel than a man.</t5879> <t5880>His hands were trembling and small.</t5880>
<t5881>His eyes were large and sorrowful.</t5881> <t5882>He had strong wing bases at his shoulders, which had fallen victim to a woodcutter's axe.</t5882> <t5883>To make sure everyone could see, they tied the monster by its ankles and hung it from one of the almond trees in the field: When it started to decay, unable to decide whether to throw it into the river like an animal carcass or bury it in the ground like a human corpse, they set a huge bundle of brushwood on fire and burned the monster.</t5883>
<t5884>Although it was never really understood whether he was truly the cause of the birds' deaths, neither did new brides give birth to monsters, nor did the temperature rise.</t5884>
<t5885>Rebeca died at the end of that year.</t5885> <t5886>Argenida, the maid who had never left her side throughout her life, reported to the authorities that her mistress had not come out of her room for three days, and when they broke the door, they found Rebeca curled up in her bed.</t5886> <t5887>She had gone bald from ringworm.</t5887>
<t5888>His finger was also in his mouth.</t5888> <t5889>Aureliano Segunda took it upon himself to handle the funeral.</t5889> <t5890>Then he wanted to repair the house to sell it.</t5890> <t5891>However, the house had become so dilapidated that the whitewash on the walls would immediately blister, and the mortar was not enough to stop the weeds that cracked the floors and the poisonous ivy that rotted the beams.</t5891>
<t5892>So this is how things went after the flood.</t5892> <t5893>As forgetfulness weighed heavily with a speed completely opposite to the sluggishness of people, memories were being forgotten.</t5893> <t5894>In the end, forgetfulness reached such an extreme point that on the umpteenth anniversary of the Neerlandia Agreement, the representatives of the President, who came to give the medal that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had refused countless times, knocked on every door to find a descendant of the colonel.</t5894> <t5895>Although Aureliano Segundo, thinking the medal was pure gold, was eager to take it immediately, Petra Cotes convinced him that it would not be appropriate to jump at the medal as the envoys wanted to hold a ceremony and had prepared declarations and speeches.</t5895> <t5896>Around that time, the gypsies, the last heirs of Melquiades' science, came back again.</t5896> <t5897>Seeing the town so dilapidated and the townspeople so disconnected from the world, just like during their first visit, they went door to door showing magnetic ingots, claiming them to be the latest discovery of the Babylonian sages.</t5897>
<t5898>They reflected the sun's rays onto a single point with large magnifying glasses.</t5898> <t5899>And once again, the crowd that gathered around, watching with open mouths as the teapots somersaulted and the dishes leaped, and pressing fifty cents to look in astonishment at the false teeth a gypsy woman put in and took out of her mouth, was not missing this time either.</t5899>
<t5900>All that was left of the train to which Mister Brown had attached his private carriage, filled with throne-like chairs and a glass ceiling, and the one hundred and twenty-car banana train that took an entire afternoon to pass, was a shabby yellow train.</t5900> <t5901>This train no longer brought anyone to Macondo, nor did it take anyone away from Macondo.</t5901> <t5902>It stopped at the deserted station once in forty years.</t5902> <t5903>The religious authorities who came to investigate the mysterious death of the birds and the report on the sacrifice of the Wandering Jew found Father Antonio Isabel playing blind man's buff with the children and, concluding that the report he had written was fabricated, took him to the asylum.</t5903> <t5904>Very soon, they sent Father Augusto Angel in his place.</t5904> <t5905>Father Augusto Angel was a young, dynamic, and proactive man.</t5905> <t5906>To keep the townspeople's spirits from becoming dull, he rang the bells himself several times a day and went door to door to call the people to church.</t5906> <t5907>However, in less than a year, the priest too succumbed to the indifference that came with the air, the scorching dust that wore everything down, and the lethargy brought on by the unbearable heat during siesta hours and the meatballs eaten during that time.</t5907>
<t5908>With Ursula's death, the house once again fell into disrepair.</t5908>
<t5909>It turned into a ruin that not even someone as lively and determined as Amaranta Ursula could save.</t5909> <t5910>Years later, when Amaranta Ursula grew up to be a grounded, unprejudiced, happy, and modern woman, she opened the doors and windows to clean up this wreckage, rearranged the garden, eradicated the red ants that had begun to roam the veranda in broad daylight, and vainly tried to revive the long-forgotten atmosphere of hospitality.</t5910>
<t5911>Fernanda's passion, buried deep in her heart as if she were locked away in a monastery, became an insurmountable obstacle against Ursula's flowing century.</t5911> <t5912>After the dry and angry wind had passed, Fernanda not only kept the doors shut but also closed the windows, following the ritual of being buried alive, and nailed them shut with crosswise boards.</t5912>
<t5913>Correspondence with the invisible doctors yielded no results.</t5913> <t5914>After the surgery date was postponed for the umpteenth time, he withdrew to his room at the agreed-upon day and time.</t5914> <t5915>He covered himself with only a white sheet and lay down with his head turned north.</t5915> <t5916>Around one in the morning, he felt a cloth soaked in icy liquid being placed on his head.</t5916>
<t5917>When he woke up, the sun was shining, and there was a rough stitch in the shape of an arc extending from between his legs to his breastbone.</t5917> <t5918>However, before completing the predetermined bed rest period, he received a concerned letter from the invisible doctors.</t5918> <t5919>The doctors wrote that despite examining him for six long hours, they could not see any of the symptoms of the illness he persistently mentioned.</t5919>
<t5920>Fernanda's habit of not being able to describe events accurately had created this confusion.</t5920> <t5921>Doctors who operated through telepathy found nothing in Fernanda except a minor uterine prolapse that could be resolved with a pessary placed on the cervix.</t5921> <t5922>Although Fernanda, who did not find what she hoped for, wanted to obtain more detailed and precise information, the doctors no longer responded to her letters.</t5922> <t5923>Fernanda began to writhe under the weight of a word she did not know.</t5923> <t5924>In the end, she couldn't bear it anymore, put aside her embarrassment, and decided to ask what a pessary meant.</t5924> <t5925>It was only then that Fernanda learned that the French doctor had hanged himself with the rope he had dangled from the ceiling three months earlier and that, despite the townspeople's opposition, he had been buried by one of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's comrades.</t5925> <t5926>She then confided her problem to her son, Jose Arcadio.</t5926> <t5927>He sent his mother the rubber rings called pessaries and the instructions on how to use them from Rome.</t5927> <t5928>After Fernanda memorized how to use the rings, she threw the paper into the toilet because she didn't want anyone in the house to know what her problem was.</t5928> <t5929>In fact, such a precaution was unnecessary; the household was already not interested in her.</t5929>
<t5930>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, despite her old age, was bustling around, cooking a few bites of food, and dedicating herself entirely to the care of Jose Arcadio Segundo.</t5930> <t5931>Amaranta Ursula, who had a charm somewhat reminiscent of Beautiful Remedios, devoted the time she used to spend tormenting Ursula to her studies.</t5931>
<t5932>His mind was working well.</t5932> <t5933>He had developed a keen interest in learning.</t5933> <t5934>This attitude of his rekindled the great hopes that Aureliano Segundo once had for Meme.</t5934>
<t5935>Following a custom that became fashionable and established during the Muz Company period, he promised to send his daughter to Brussels to complete her education.</t5935> <t5936>This dream led him to revive the lands devastated by floods.</t5936> <t5937>Aureliano Segundo's rare visits home, once every forty years, were solely to see Amaranta Ursula.</t5937> <t5938>Because over time, he had become completely estranged from Fernanda.</t5938> <t5939>Meanwhile, young Aureliano became more introverted as he reached adolescence.</t5939> <t5940>Aureliano Segundo hoped that as Fernanda aged, she would soften and not object to the child integrating into the town's life.</t5940>
<t5941>None of the townspeople would bother to investigate the child's true identity anyway.</t5941> <t5942>However, it seemed that Aureliano also preferred solitude, showing no curiosity or interest in the world that began at the front door of the house.</t5942>
<t5943>After Ursula had the room of Melquiades opened, Aureliano began to wander around the room.</t5943> <t5944>He was peeking inside through the slightly open door.</t5944>
<t5945>Nobody understood when the mutual closeness between Jose Arcadio Segundo and them began.</t5945> <t5946>Aureliano Segundo only learned about their friendship much later, when the child spoke of the massacre at the station.</t5946> <t5947>One day at the dinner table, when someone complained that the town had not recovered since the Banana Company left, the child mentioned the massacre at the station and opposed with the mature views of an adult.</t5947> <t5948>Contrary to the general opinion, Aureliano argued that Macondo was a prosperous and abundant place before the Banana Company came, corrupted the town, disrupted its order, and imposed its dominance.</t5948> <t5949>He also claimed that the engineers of the company caused the flood to avoid fulfilling the promises made to the workers.</t5949> <t5950>He spoke so logically and beautifully that Fernanda, hearing him speak like that in the presence of intelligent people, compared him to false prophets trying to disrespect religion.</t5950>
<t5951>The child described in detail how the soldiers mowed down more than three thousand workers trapped in front of the station with machine guns, and how they loaded the corpses onto a two hundred-car train and dumped them into the sea.</t5951> <t5952>Like most people who believed the official statements and thought nothing had happened, Fernanda, upon hearing this, told the child to be quiet, fearing that he had adopted Colonel Aureliano Buendia's anarchist views.</t5952> <t5953>However, Aureliano Segundo recognized his brother's views in the child's account.</t5953> <t5954>Despite everyone thinking he was crazy at the time, Jose Arcadio Segundo was actually the most sensible person in the house.</t5954>
<t5955>He taught young Aureliano to read and write, then started having him decipher the manuscripts.</t5955> <t5956>At the same time, he explained what the Banana Company meant for Macondo and what the company did, according to his personal interpretations.</t5956> <t5957>When Aureliano, who grew up learning these things, joined the world years later, no one believed what he said.</t5957> <t5958>Because what he recounted was completely contrary to the fabrications that historians concocted and wrote in textbooks.</t5958> <t5959>In the room where the dry heat, dust, and wind did not enter, both Jose Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano reached the insights of an old man whose characteristics had been passed down through generations, an old man sitting by the window with a crow-wing hat.</t5959> <t5960>That man had determined his worldview long before they were born.</t5960>
<t5961>The uncle and the nephew would arrive at the same conclusions at the same time, always realizing simultaneously what it meant for it to always be March and always be Monday.</t5961>
<t5962>Then, they realized that, as it was said at home, Jose Arcadio Buendia was not crazy, and that time could occasionally stumble and sprain its ankle, leaving a slice of itself in a room that would remain forever unchanged as it got back up. Only Jose Arcadio Buendia had comprehended this truth.</t5962> <t5963>Jose Arcadio Segundo had also deciphered the letters of the manuscripts that resembled a code.</t5963> <t5964>He had deduced that this writing had an alphabet of forty-seven or fifty-three letters.</t5964> <t5965>When the letters were written individually, they looked like scribbles.</t5965> <t5966>Especially with Melquiades' fine handwriting, they resembled clothes hanging on a line.</t5966>
<t5967>Aureliano remembered seeing pictures of similar letters in an English encyclopedia and brought it to the room to compare it with the code that Jose Arcadio Segundo had deciphered.</t5967> <t5968>Indeed, the two alphabets matched.</t5968>
<t5969>Aureliano Segundo, during the time he was organizing the lottery puzzle, started waking up with a knot in his throat.</t5969> <t5970>It was as if he wanted to cry but couldn't.</t5970> <t5971>Petra Cotes attributed this discomfort to the nervous breakdown caused by bad days.</t5971> <t5972>For over a year, every morning she would smear honey on the roof of Aureliano Segundo's mouth with the tip of a spoon and make him drink radish juice.</t5972> <t5973>When the condition in his throat made it difficult for him to breathe, Aureliano Segundo ran to Pilar Ternera and asked if she knew of an old folk remedy to cure him.</t5973> <t5974>His audacious grandmother, who had reached the age of a hundred by secretly running a small brothel, didn't believe in folk remedies and turned to the cards.</t5974> <t5975>Seeing that the leg of the spade had injured the queen of hearts by the neck, she said that Fernanda had cast a spell to bring her husband back home, resorting to an outdated method like sticking needles into her husband's picture, but since she couldn't manage the spell, it had caused a tumor in his throat.</t5975> <t5976>Aureliano Segundo had no other pictures except those taken at the wedding, and they were in the family album.</t5976>
<t5977>Aureliano Segundo, without his wife noticing, started searching the house and found half a dozen pesos at the bottom of one of the drawers, still in their original box.</t5977> <t5978>Thinking the small, red rubber rings were related to magic, Aureliano Segundo put them in his pocket to show Pilar Ternera.</t5978> <t5979>Pilar Ternera couldn't understand what the rings were, but since she didn't trust them at all, she decided there was something fishy about them and lit a fire in the garden to burn the rings.</t5979> <t5980>To break Fernanda's spell, she told Aureliano Segundo to wet a broody hen and bury it alive under the chestnut tree.</t5980> <t5981>Aureliano Segundo had so much faith in her words that he felt his breathing ease even before he could cover the mound where he buried the hen with more dry leaves.</t5981> <t5982>Fernanda, on the other hand, interpreted the disappearance of the rings as a retaliation by the invisible doctors and placed the new rings sent by her son in a hidden pocket she sewed into her blouse.</t5982>
<t5983>Six months after burying the chicken, Aureliano Segundo woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible coughing fit.</t5983> <t5984>It felt as if a crab had wrapped around his throat and was squeezing it.</t5984> <t5985>At that moment, despite all the magical rings he had burned and the chickens he had buried, he realized there was only one truth and that he was about to die.</t5985> <t5986>He didn't tell anyone anything.</t5986> <t5987>Fearing he would die before sending Amaranta Ursula to Brussels, he threw himself into an unprecedented amount of work and started holding the lottery three times a week instead of once.</t5987> <t5988>He would go out early in the morning, touring the whole town to sell tickets with the urgency and excitement befitting someone nearing death, reaching even the most remote neighborhoods.</t5988> <t5989>"Divine Providence Lottery," he would shout.</t5989> <t5990>"Don't miss the chance, such an opportunity comes only once in a hundred years."</t5990>
<t5991>She was trying to appear cheerful, to chatter, and to show delicacy.</t5991>
<t5992>But it was enough to see the pallor of his face and the beads of sweat to understand that he wasn't doing these things wholeheartedly.</t5992> <t5993>Sometimes he would retreat to a secluded corner or collapse where he stood just to catch his breath, escaping the claws tearing at his insides.</t5993> <t5994>Even at midnight, he would wander around, go to the red-light district, and try to comfort the lonely women crying over gramophones by inviting them to try their luck.</t5994> <t5995>He would take out the tickets and say, -Look, this number hasn't won the lottery for four months.</t5995> <t5996>-Don't miss this chance; life isn't as long as you think.</t5996>
<t5997>In the end, he lost his respectability.</t5997> <t5998>They started to mock him.</t5998> <t5999>Especially in his final months, they stopped calling him Don Aureliano as they used to and started calling him 'Mr. Divine Providence' to his face.</t5999> <t6000>Aureliano Segundo's voice became increasingly hoarse and off-key.</t6000> <t6001>In the end, it turned into a dog's growl.</t6001> <t6002>Nevertheless, it did not extinguish the hope brought by those gathered in Petra Cotes' garden.</t6002> <t6003>When he lost his voice and foresaw that the pain would soon become unbearable, he realized that the lottery of pigs and goats would not be enough to send his daughter to Brussels.</t6003> <t6004>Thereupon, thinking of putting his land, which someone with money could easily restore to its former state, into a lottery, he organized a legendary lottery.</t6004> <t6005>This was such a comprehensive initiative that even the mayor did not hesitate to help by announcing the lottery with an official proclamation.</t6005> <t6006>He formed associations to buy the tickets, each costing a hundred pesos, and within a week, the tickets were sold out.</t6006> <t6007>On the night the lottery was drawn, the winners organized a grand celebration.</t6007> <t6008>It was a fanfare comparable only to the festivities during the Banana Company era.</t6008> <t6009>And Aureliano Segundo played the long-forgotten songs of Francisco the Devil-Teaser on the accordion for the last time, but this time he couldn't sing the songs.</t6009>
<t6010>Two months later, Amaranta Ursula went to Brussels.</t6010> <t6011>Aureliano Segundo not only gave her the money collected from the big lottery, but also added the money he had been able to set aside in previous months and the money he gathered by selling the piano, accordion, and a heap of old knick-knacks.</t6011> <t6012>According to his calculations, this money would be enough for his daughter's education.</t6012>
<t6013>Only the fare for the return trip was missing.</t6013> <t6014>Fernanda, who went mad at the thought of Brussels being too close to Paris and Paris's scandals, opposed her daughter's departure until the last moment.</t6014> <t6015>But when Father Angel wrote a letter to a dormitory run by nuns and established for Catholic young girls, and when Amaranta Ursula promised to stay there until she completed her education, Fernanda calmed down.</t6015> <t6016>Moreover, the priest entrusted the girl to a group of Franciscan nuns going to Toledo and got their promise to find someone reliable going to Belgium and to hand over Amaranta Ursula to them.</t6016>
<t6017>While the correspondence for organizing these matters continued, Aureliano Segundo, with the help of Petra Cotes, was preparing Amaranta Ursula's belongings.</t6017> <t6018>The night they placed the clothes in one of Fernanda's dowry chests, everything was so well determined that Amaranta Ursula already knew by heart that she would wear her suits, fabric slippers while crossing the Atlantic, and the blue coat with copper buttons and fine leather shoes when she disembarked from the ship.</t6018> <t6019>She had also memorized how she should walk to avoid falling into the sea when disembarking, that she would never leave the nuns' side, that she would not step out of her cabin except during meal times, and that she would not answer any questions from anyone on the ship, whether man or woman.</t6019>
<t6020>Next to Amaranta Ursula, there was a medicine to be dropped into water to prevent seasickness, and a notebook containing six prayers written by Father Angel himself to be read in case of a storm.</t6020> <t6021>Fernanda sewed her a belt made of canvas to keep her money in and advised her not to take it off even while sleeping.</t6021> <t6022>Although she wanted to give her a chamber pot washed with lye water and disinfected with alcohol, Amaranta Ursula did not take it because she feared her classmates would make fun of her.</t6022>
<t6023>A few months later, as Aureliano Segundo was taking his last breath, he would remember his daughter as he last saw her, struggling to lower the window of the second-class compartment to hear what advice her mother was giving again.</t6023>
<t6024>Amaranta Ursula was wearing a silk dress of pink color.</t6024> <t6025>She had pinned a bunch of artificial violets to her left shoulder.</t6025> <t6026>On her feet were low-heeled leather shoes with large buckles, and she wore silk stockings held up by garters.</t6026> <t6027>She was very slender.</t6027> <t6028>She had left her long hair loose.</t6028>
<t6029>Her lively eyes resembled Ursula's appearance at that age, and the fact that she neither cried nor smiled when leaving also proved that she was as strong as Ursula.</t6029>
<t6030>While walking alongside the accelerating carriage and holding Fernanda's arm to prevent her from falling, Aureliano Segundo could only manage to wave back to his daughter who was blowing kisses with her hand.</t6030>
<t6031>The husband and wife stood motionless under the scorching sun, watching the train until it became a black line on the horizon.</t6031> <t6032>For the first time since their wedding, they had linked arms.</t6032>
<t6033>On the ninth of August, before any letter had arrived from Brussels, while Jose Arcadio Segundo was talking with Aureliano in Melquiades' room, he said, without even realizing what he was saying, "Never forget that there were more than three thousand of them and that they were all thrown into the sea."</t6033>
<t6034>Then he fell on his back onto the manuscripts and died with his eyes open.</t6034> <t6035>At the same time, in Fernanda's bed, his twin brother reached the end of his long struggle with the steel pincers that had been gnawing at his throat.</t6035>
<t6036>A week ago, with his voice completely gone, struggling to breathe and reduced to skin and bones, he had begun to fulfill the promise he made to die beside his wife, gathering his trunks and his wandering accordion, dizzy from going back and forth between two houses.</t6036> <t6037>Petra Cotes helped him gather his trunks and saw him off without shedding a single tear.</t6037> <t6038>However, she had forgotten to give him the shoes he had requested to be buried in.</t6038> <t6039>Therefore, when she heard that Aureliano Segundo had died, Petra Cotes dressed in mourning, wrapped the shoes in a newspaper, and asked Fernanda for permission to see the deceased.</t6039> <t6040>Fernanda did not let her step inside the threshold.</t6040>
<t6041>Petra Cotes pleaded, "Put yourself in my place."</t6041>
<t6042>Think about how much I must have loved him to accept such humiliation, he said.</t6042>
<t6043>Fernanda replied, "Metresler deserves all kinds of humiliation."</t6043> <t6044>"Wait, and when another friend dies, you can put the shoes on them."</t6044>
<t6045>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, in order to keep her promise to her son and ensure he wasn't buried alive, slit Jose Arcadio Segundo's throat with a kitchen knife.</t6045> <t6046>The bodies were placed in identical coffins.</t6046> <t6047>When they died, the two brothers looked so much alike that they were indistinguishable, just like in their childhood.</t6047>
<t6048>Aureliano Segundo's companions from his days of revelry placed a wreath with a purple ribbon on the coffin, which read, "Hold on cows, life passes by quickly."</t6048> <t6049>Fernanda, driven mad by this insolence, had the wreath thrown away.</t6049> <t6050>In the chaos of the final moment, the grieving drunkards who were taking the coffins out of the house mixed them up and buried them in the wrong graves.</t6050>
<t6051>Aureliano did not leave Melquiades' room for a long time.</t6051>
<t6052>He memorized the tales from the book that had become thoroughly worn and tattered, the results of Topal Hermann's research, the notes on the science of jinn and demons, the mysteries of the philosopher's stone, Nostradamus's prophecies, and the research on the plague.</t6052> <t6053>Thus, by the time he reached adolescence, he knew nothing about his own era but had learned the basic knowledge of medieval people.</t6053> <t6054>Whenever Santa Sofia de la Piedad entered his room, she found the child engrossed in reading.</t6054> <t6055>At sunrise, she would bring him a cup of plain coffee, and at noon, a plate of rice with fried plantains.</t6055> <t6056>Since the death of Aureliano Segundo, nothing else was eaten in the house.</t6056> <t6057>Santa Sofia de la Piedad cut Aureliano's hair, picked out his lice, and altered the clothes she found in the trunks to fit him.</t6057>
<t6058>When the child's mustache began to sweat, she brought him Colonel Aureliano Buendia's razor and the gourd he used as a shaving bowl.</t6058> <t6059>None of the Colonel's children, not even Aureliano Jose, resembled the Colonel as much as Aureliano did.</t6059> <t6060>His prominent cheekbones and full lips, which gave his face a merciless expression, were just like the Colonel's.</t6060> <t6061>Just as Ursula had once been surprised to see Aureliano Segundo working in that room, now Santa Sofia de la Piedad was surprised, thinking Aureliano was talking to himself.</t6061> <t6062>But the child was talking to Melquiades.</t6062>
<t6063>Shortly after the twins' death, during a scorching midday, Aureliano saw the old man with the crow-wing hat in front of the window.</t6063>
<t6064>It was like the materialization and animation of a memory etched into his mind before he was born.</t6064> <t6065>Aureliano had deciphered the alphabet of the manuscripts.</t6065> <t6066>When Melquiades asked him if he knew what language the writings were in, Aureliano replied without hesitation, Sanskrit.</t6066>
<t6067>Melquiades explained that the possibility of returning to the room was limited.</t6067> <t6068>But he said that he could rest comfortably in the lands of eternal death, without any worries.</t6068> <t6069>Because since Aureliano had learned the alphabet, by the time the manuscripts would become readable, that is, a hundred years after they were written, he would have learned enough Sanskrit to read them.</t6069> <t6070>Melquiades told Aureliano that there was now a Catalonian's bookstore in the narrow street leading to the river, where dream interpretations were made during the Banana Company era, and that there was a Sanskrit reading book in that store, which would be devoured by moths within six years if he did not hurry.</t6070> <t6071>When Aureliano described the store to Santa Sofia de la Piedad and asked her to bring him the book standing on the right edge of the second shelf, between Milton's poems and Jerusalem Delivered, Santa Sofia de la Piedad revealed an emotion for the first time in her life: She was surprised.</t6071> <t6072>Since she was illiterate, she memorized what Aureliano said, and after the night the soldiers searched the house, she sold one of the seventeen gold fish, whose location was known only to her and Aureliano, to get the money needed for the book.</t6072>
<t6073>Melquiades' visits became less frequent, and in the midday sun, he appeared increasingly distant and faint.</t6073> <t6074>Meanwhile, Aureliano was improving his Sanskrit.</t6074> <t6075>During Melquiades' last visit, Aureliano did not see him, but he heard him whispering in the room, "Death from fever on the scorching sands of Singapore."</t6075> <t6076>From that day on, he lost his immunity to dust, heat, worms, red ants, and the moths that would turn the wisdom in the manuscripts into sawdust.</t6076>
<t6077>There was no shortage of food at home.</t6077> <t6078>The day after Aureliano Segundo's death, one of the friends who had brought that disrespectful wreath came to Fernanda and said he wanted to settle his debt to her husband.</t6078>
<t6079>After that day, every Wednesday, a child started bringing a basket full of food that would last a week.</t6079> <t6080>Nobody knew that Petra Cotes was sending this food and that she did so because she believed helping the person who had humiliated her would, in turn, humiliate them.</t6080> <t6081>Although Petra Cotes's anger towards Fernanda subsided faster than she had expected, Petra continued to send food initially to preserve her honor and later out of pity for them.</t6081>
<t6082>Sometimes there were no animals left to put in the lottery, and sometimes no one was interested in the lottery.</t6082> <t6083>At such times, just so Fernanda wouldn't go hungry, Petra Cotes would go without food for days.</t6083> <t6084>Petra continued this until the day she saw Fernanda's funeral procession.</t6084>
<t6085>For Santa Sofia de la Piedad, the reduction in the household crowd meant finding the opportunity for the rest she deserved after working like a slave for half a century.</t6085> <t6086>The woman, who had added the angelic seed of Beautiful Remedios and the mysterious stillness of Jose Arcadio Segundo to the family, had never uttered a single complaint.</t6086> <t6087>She had spent her entire life in seclusion, dedicating herself to raising children she was confused about whether they were her children or grandchildren.</t6087> <t6088>She had cared for little Aureliano as if he were her own child, embracing him without ever knowing she was his great-grandmother.</t6088> <t6089>Santa Sofia de la Piedad laying a bed in the pantry where mice ran rampant was something that could only be comprehended within the atmosphere of that house.</t6089>
<t6090>The poor woman had woken up in fear one night, sensing that someone was watching her in the dark, and had seen a huge, poisonous snake coiled on her stomach. She had not mentioned this incident to anyone.</t6090>
<t6091>He knew that if he told Ursula, she would take him into her embrace.</t6091>
<t6092>But they were going through such days that unless someone stepped out onto the veranda and shouted at the top of their lungs, no one knew anything about anyone else.</t6092>
<t6093>The frantic work in the oven, then the bewilderment of the war, then the care of the children, no one had found the opportunity to think about the happiness of others.</t6093> <t6094>The only person who did not forget him was Petra Cotes, whom he had never even seen.</t6094> <t6095>Petra Cotes made sure that Santa Sofia de la Piedad lacked nothing, always thinking of a new pair of shoes she could wear when going out, and clothes to put on her back.</t6095> <t6096>Even in the days when lotteries were run only through miraculous efforts, Petra did not forget her.</t6096> <t6097>When Fernanda came as a bride, she thought Santa Sofia de la Piedad was a servant of indeterminate age, and although she had heard several times that she was her husband's mother, she found it so unbelievable that she preferred to immediately forget that she was her mother-in-law.</t6097> <t6098>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, on the other hand, never minded being treated as a servant.</t6098> <t6099>On the contrary, she seemed to enjoy staying in the background: She worked tirelessly and without complaint to keep this house, where she had lived since her youth and which had especially turned into a barracks during the Banana Company period, tidy and clean.</t6099>
<t6100>When Ama Ursula died, the superhuman efforts and inexhaustible energy of Santa Sofia de la Piedad began to wane.</t6100> <t6101>The reason for this decline was not just because she had aged and grown tired.</t6101> <t6102>When Ursula died, the house collapsed overnight.</t6102> <t6103>A soft layer of moss appeared on the walls.</t6103>
<t6104>The weeds that covered the garden, having left no space as small as the eye of a needle, began to press against the cement of the veranda, breaking through the cement flooring like glass and sprouting shoots.</t6104> <t6105>In the split cracks, buds of yellow flowers identical to those Ursula had found in Melquiades' false teeth a century ago burst open.</t6105> <t6106>Santa Sofia de la Piedad, who had neither the time nor the means to stop nature's defiance, spent her entire day chasing away the lizards that had invaded the bedrooms.</t6106>
<t6107>As for the lizards, they would come back once it was night again.</t6107>
<t6108>Santa Sofia de la Piedad saw one morning that red ants were emerging from the foundations they had hollowed out, crossing the garden, climbing the veranda railings where the begonias had turned the color of earth, and then entering the house.</t6108> <t6109>She first tried to kill the ants with a broom.</t6109>
<t6110>Then she tried insecticides.</t6110> <t6111>When they didn't work either, she poured soapy water.</t6111> <t6112>But the next day, the ants came again, walking inside without any hindrance.</t6112> <t6113>Fernanda, who was engrossed in writing a letter to her children, was unaware of this unstoppable destructive invasion.</t6113> <t6114>Santa Sofia de la Piedad was struggling alone, trying to prevent the weeds from taking over the kitchen, cleaning the spider webs that would be woven again in a few hours, and digging out the nests of bedbugs.</t6114> <t6115>However, when she saw that Melquiades' room was also getting dusty, that she couldn't cope with the spider webs despite sweeping three times a day, and realized that the room had now taken on the same ruinous appearance that only Colonel Aureliano Buendia and the young officer had seen before, Santa Sofia de la Piedad understood that she had been defeated by nature.</t6115>
<t6116>Then he put on his bargaining clothes, Ursula's old shoes, the muslin socks given by Amaranta Ursula, and packed the remaining few layers of laundry.</t6116>
<t6117>Aureliano, "I have given up," he said.</t6117> <t6118>"This housework is not something my bones can handle."</t6118>
<t6119>Aureliano asked where she was going.</t6119> <t6120>The woman made an ambiguous gesture as if she didn't know where she was going.</t6120> <t6121>Still trying to offer an explanation, she said she would spend her final years with her niece in Riohacha.</t6121> <t6122>This was not a very plausible explanation, because after her parents died, Santa Sofia de la Piedad had neither interacted with anyone in town, received any letters, nor mentioned any relatives.</t6122> <t6123>When Santa Sofia de la Piedad attempted to set off with one peso and twenty-five cents in her pocket, Aureliano forcibly gave her seventeen gold fish.</t6123> <t6124>Then he watched from the room's window as the woman, with her laundry bundle on her shoulder, bent over with age, dragging her feet through the garden, opened the garden gate, and after passing through, bolted it again.</t6124>
<t6125>There has been no news from Santa Sofia de la Piedad since.</t6125>
<t6126>When Fernanda heard that Santa Sofia de la Piedad had run away, she spent the whole day searching the house to see if anything was stolen, emptying trunks and baskets, and rummaging through cupboards and drawers.</t6126>
<t6127>Then, when she tried to light the fire for the first time in her life, she burned her fingers and asked Aureliano to teach her how to make coffee.</t6127>
<t6128>Over time, Aureliano took over the kitchen duties.</t6128> <t6129>When Fernanda woke up as she used to, she found her breakfast ready and only left her room to get her meals.</t6129> <t6130>She would take the food that Aureliano had left on the embers to keep warm, spread the linen cloths, light the candlesticks, sit at the head of the table facing fifteen empty chairs, and eat her meal.</t6130>
<t6131>Even under these conditions, Aureliano and Fernanda did not share their loneliness.</t6131> <t6132>Each lived on their own, trying to clean their own rooms, and destroy the spider webs that fell like snow on the rose bushes, covered the ceiling beams, and plastered the walls.</t6132> <t6133>It was during this time that Fernanda got the feeling that the house was infested with spirits.</t6133> <t6134>The furniture in the house, especially the items used daily, had started to move on their own.</t6134>
<t6135>Fernanda was searching for the scissors she was certain she had left on the bed, and then found them on the kitchen shelf, a place she thought she hadn't visited in four days.</t6135> <t6136>She saw that there were no forks in the drawer where the silverware was kept, and found six of them on the altar and three in the bathroom.</t6136> <t6137>Especially when she sat down to write, the constant movement of objects became even more exasperating.</t6137> <t6138>The inkwell she had placed on the right side of the table had moved to the left, and Fernanda only found the missing blotting paper under her pillow two days later.</t6138>
<t6139>The pages of the letter he wrote to Jose Arcadio were getting mixed up with the letter he wrote to Amaranta Ursula.</t6139> <t6140>Fernanda always had the feeling that she put one person's letter in the other's envelope.</t6140>
<t6141>Indeed, it happened a few times.</t6141> <t6142>Once, she lost her fountain pen.</t6142> <t6143>Two weeks later, the postman, who found the fountain pen in his own bag, returned it.</t6143> <t6144>He had gone door to door looking for the owner of the pen.</t6144> <t6145>At first, Fernanda thought that these things were the work of invisible doctors, and that they had risen up like ghosts.</t6145> <t6146>She even started to write a letter to the doctors, begging them to leave her alone.</t6146> <t6147>But while writing the letter, she got up to do something, and when she returned to the room, she couldn't find the letter and had forgotten why she was writing it.</t6147> <t6148>For a while, she thought it was Aureliano who was doing these things.</t6148>
<t6149>He started to watch Aureliano.</t6149> <t6150>He left some things in the open to see if he would move them or not.</t6150> <t6151>But very soon, he definitely understood that Aureliano did not leave Melquiades' room except to go to the kitchen or the bathroom and that he was not someone who would play such games.</t6151> <t6152>In the end, he believed it was the work of spirits or fairies and decided to tie everything to its place of use.</t6152>
<t6153>She hung the scissors by a long string at the head of her bed.</t6153> <t6154>With the fountain pen, she tied the blotting paper to the leg of the table.</t6154> <t6155>She stuck the ink bottle to the right side of the table, where she always used it.</t6155> <t6156>However, the problems were not something that could be solved immediately.</t6156> <t6157>A few hours after Fernanda tied the scissors, she saw that the string was short and didn't reach.</t6157> <t6158>It was as if goblins had cut the string.</t6158> <t6159>The same thing happened to the string she tied to the fountain pen.</t6159> <t6160>It even seemed as if her own arm had shortened, because soon she couldn't reach the ink bottle.</t6160>
<t6161>Neither Amaranta Ursula in Brussels nor Jose Arcadio in Rome had any idea about these minor troubles.</t6161> <t6162>Fernanda was writing to them that she was fine and in good spirits.</t6162>
<t6163>It really was like that.</t6163> <t6164>Because he wasn't seeking a compromise in any matter, he wasn't making any concessions.</t6164> <t6165>It was as if life was dragging him back into the world of his own family, a realm where people didn't deal with daily problems but found solutions to these problems in their minds beforehand.</t6165>
<t6166>First with the doctors, then with her children, her endless correspondence, especially after Santa Sofia de la Piedad left, distanced Fernanda even further from the concept of time.</t6166> <t6167>She began to mark the dates of her children's visits to the house and track the days, months, and years.</t6167> <t6168>But as her children kept changing their arrival dates, the days started to blend together, the durations became uncertain, in short, the passage of time became incomprehensible.</t6168> <t6169>Instead of becoming impatient as her children's visits were delayed, Fernanda was pleased with these postponements.</t6169> <t6170>Even though years had passed since the night Jose Arcadio announced he would take his priestly vows, her son kept writing that he would first complete his studies in high theology and then pursue a career in diplomacy.</t6170> <t6171>Fernanda was not saddened by this news.</t6171> <t6172>Because she knew how steep and challenging the winding staircase leading to Saint Peter's throne was.</t6172> <t6173>Especially when she received news from her son, such as seeing His Holiness the Pope, which others might not find significant, Fernanda's spirits were greatly lifted.</t6173>
<t6174>Fernanda felt the same joy when Amaranta Ursula wrote that her education would take longer than expected because she had earned certain rights that her father had not accounted for due to her diligence.</t6174>
<t6175>Three years after Santa Sofia de la Piedad brought the grammar book, Aureliano managed to turn the first page of the manuscripts.</t6175>
<t6176>This was not a futile endeavor.</t6176> <t6177>However, it was the first step on a path whose length could not be determined.</t6177> <t6178>Because the text translated into Spanish made no sense; it was written in code.</t6178> <t6179>Aureliano did not have the key to decipher this code: Then he remembered that Melquiades had said that the books to help him read the manuscripts were in the wise Catalonian's shop, and he decided to ask Fernanda for permission to go get the books.</t6179> <t6180>Pacing in the wretched room succumbing to relentless decay, Aureliano thought about the best way to convey his request.</t6180>
<t6181>Then, at the only place where he had the opportunity to talk to Fernanda, that is, while the woman was taking her food off the fire, he confronted her.</t6181> <t6182>But the words he had thought about and prepared for a long time got stuck in his throat, and he couldn't speak.</t6182> <t6183>The only time Aureliano showed interest in and looked after Fernanda was on this day when he asked for permission.</t6183> <t6184>He was listening to Fernanda's footsteps wandering around her room.</t6184> <t6185>He heard her come down to the door to receive letters from her children and to give her own writings to the postman.</t6185> <t6186>He listened to the scratching of her pen on the papers until late at night.</t6186> <t6187>Then he heard the light being turned off and Fernanda praying in the dark.</t6187> <t6188>Only then would Aureliano fall asleep, thinking that the opportunity he had been waiting for would come the next day.</t6188>
<t6189>He was so convinced that he could get the permission he had been waiting for one of these days that one morning he cut his hair that fell on his shoulders, shaved his scraggly beard, put on a tight pair of pants whose origin he did not know, and a shirt with a detachable collar, and waited in the kitchen for Fernanda to come and get her breakfast.</t6189> <t6190>The woman who walked every day with her head held high and with firm steps did not appear that day.</t6190>
<t6191>Instead, an extraordinarily beautiful old woman, wearing a yellowed ermine cloak and a crown made of gilded paper, who looked as if she had been secretly crying, came into the kitchen.</t6191> <t6192>In fact, Fernanda had worn the clothes many times since she found the moth-eaten queen's garments while rummaging through Aureliano Segundo's trunks.</t6192> <t6193>If anyone had seen her dressed like that, standing in front of the mirror and losing herself while watching her queenly movements, they would have thought Fernanda was crazy.</t6193>
<t6194>But she was not crazy.</t6194> <t6195>She had dressed as the Queen to refresh her memories.</t6195> <t6196>When she first wore the cloak, her heart ached, and her eyes filled with tears.</t6196>
<t6197>Because at that moment, she had smelled the polish of the officer's boots who had taken her from home to make her a queen, and her soul was illuminated with the longing for her unfulfilled dreams.</t6197>
<t6198>Now he felt so old, so exhausted, so far removed from the good days</t6198>
<t6199>He was feeling so lost that he even began to long for the days filled with the worst memories.</t6199> <t6200>It was then that he realized how much he missed the hydrangeas on the veranda, the scent of the roses at sunset, and even the boorish behavior of the nouveau riche crowd.</t6200>
<t6201>His heart, which had easily withstood even the most shocking of daily realities, shattered into pieces at the first surge of this longing.</t6201>
<t6202>The need to feel sorrow was turning into a passion over the years.</t6202> <t6203>He became humane in his loneliness.</t6203> <t6204>However, on the morning he entered the kitchen and saw a pale, bony young man with misty eyes handing him a coffee cup, he was seized by the feeling of being ridiculous.</t6204> <t6205>In his anger, he not only refused to let the young man stay, but also stopped taking out the keys he kept in a secret pocket where he stored unused items.</t6205> <t6206>This was an unnecessary precaution, because Aureliano could very well come and go without Fernanda noticing if he wanted to.</t6206> <t6207>However, being confined for years, not knowing the world, and getting used to obeying had dried up the seeds of rebellion in his heart.</t6207>
<t6208>That's why he locked himself in the room again.</t6208> <t6209>He began to read the manuscripts over and over again.</t6209> <t6210>Meanwhile, he listened to the sobs of Fernanda crying in the bedroom.</t6210> <t6211>One morning, as usual, when he entered the kitchen to light the fire, he saw that the food he had left the day before for Fernanda to take was still untouched on the ashes.</t6211> <t6212>Then he looked into Fernanda's bedroom and saw that the woman had covered herself with her ermine cloak and that her face, more beautiful than ever, had turned an ivory color.</t6212> <t6213>When Jose Arcadio arrived four months later, he found Fernanda lying in the same way.</t6213>
<t6214>It was inconceivable that any man could resemble his mother as much as Jose Arcadio did.</t6214> <t6215>Jose Arcadio was wearing a taffeta suit, a shirt with a round and stiff collar, and instead of a tie, he had tied a thin silk ribbon.</t6215>
<t6216>He had pink cheeks, timid eyes, and thin lips.</t6216> <t6217>His shiny, straight, black hair, parted in the middle with a weary line, gave him an artificial look, like the wigs of saint statues.</t6217> <t6218>The shadow of the well-polished beard on his waxy face spread like a pang of conscience.</t6218> <t6219>He had white hands with green-veined, leech-like fingers, and he wore a gold ring with a round, yellow opal stone on the index finger of his left hand.</t6219> <t6220>When Aureliano opened the street door, he didn't need to know who the man in front of him was to understand that he had come from very far away.</t6220>
<t6221>As Jose Arcadio stepped over the threshold, the scent of the cologne that Ursula had sprinkled on him in his childhood to distinguish him filled the house.</t6221> <t6222>After so many years of separation, Jose Arcadio was still inexplicably like a withered child.</t6222> <t6223>He was as melancholic and as introverted as could be.</t6223> <t6224>He went straight to his mother's bedroom, the room where Aureliano had been boiling mercury in his great-grandfather's still for four months to preserve the corpse, following Melquiades' formula.</t6224> <t6225>Jose Arcadio did not ask Aureliano any questions.</t6225>
<t6226>He kissed the corpse on the forehead, then took out three unused pesetas and the keys to the cupboard from under his mother's skirt.</t6226> <t6227>Contrary to his absent-minded appearance, his movements were precise and determined.</t6227> <t6228>He took out a steel box with the family crest engraved on it from the cupboard.</t6228> <t6229>In the sandalwood-scented box, there was a long letter in which Fernanda had listed a heap of truths she had kept hidden from him.</t6229>
<t6230>Jose Arcadio was reading the letter standing up, quickly but without excitement.</t6230>
<t6231>When he got to the third page, he stopped and scrutinized Aureliano from head to toe as if seeing him for the first time.</t6231> <t6232>In a voice as sharp as a knife, he said, "So you're the bastard."</t6232>
<t6233>-I am Ben Aureliano Buendia.</t6233>
<t6234>Jose Arcadio said, "Go to your room."</t6234>
<t6235>Aureliano went to his room and didn't even bother to look out when he heard the preparations for the funeral.</t6235> <t6236>Sometimes, while he was in the kitchen, he would hear Jose Arcadio wandering around the house, breathing heavily, and after midnight, the sound of footsteps coming from the now dilapidated bedrooms.</t6236> <t6237>Aureliano didn't hear his voice for months.</t6237> <t6238>Just as Jose Arcadio didn't speak to him, Aureliano, who had devoted all his attention to the manuscripts, wasn't inclined to talk either.</t6238> <t6239>When Fernanda died, he had taken the penultimate fish and had gone to the Catalonian's shop in the hope of finding the books he was looking for.</t6239>
<t6240>Perhaps because he lacked memories to make a comparison, nothing he saw on the road interested him.</t6240> <t6241>The deserted streets and empty houses were exactly as Aureliano had imagined them when he once longed to see the world.</t6241> <t6242>Aureliano had granted himself the permission he couldn't get from Fernanda, on the condition that it was a one-time exception and that he wouldn't exceed the necessary time for his task.</t6242> <t6243>That's why he quickly passed through the eleven street corners between the narrow street where dreams were interpreted in the old days and the house without pausing, and breathlessly reached the cluttered and dim shop that seemed to have no room to move.</t6243> <t6244>This place looked more like a warehouse where old books were piled up than a bookstore.</t6244> <t6245>Books were stacked even on the worm-eaten shelves, the sticky cobwebbed corners, and the so-called spaces left for passage.</t6245>
<t6246>The shop owner was once again sitting at a long table piled with old books and papers, writing incomprehensible notes with purple ink on sheets torn from a school notebook.</t6246>
<t6247>He was a handsome man with silver-colored hair falling over his forehead like a parrot's crest.</t6247> <t6248>In his close-set, lively eyes, there was an expression as if he had read all the books.</t6248> <t6249>He was wearing shorts.</t6249> <t6250>Sweat was trickling down from every part of him.</t6250> <t6251>He didn't even stop writing to see who had entered.</t6251>
<t6252>Aureliano found the five books he was looking for in this dizzying confusion as if he had placed them there himself, because the books were exactly where Melquiades had said they would be.</t6252> <t6253>Without saying a word, Aureliano handed the books and the small goldfish to the wise Catalonian.</t6253> <t6254>The man, squinting his eyes like two seashells, looked at the books and the fish, then shrugged his shoulders saying in his own language, "You must have lost your mind," and handed the five books and the fish back to Aureliano.</t6254> <t6255>Then, speaking in Spanish, he said, "Take them, they are yours."</t6255> <t6256>"The last person to read these books was Blind Izak, so think carefully before you get involved in this."</t6256>
<t6257>Jose Arcadio fixed up Meme's room, having the silk canopy of the bed fit for kings cleaned and repaired, and the velvet curtains adjusted.</t6257> <t6258>He reopened the unused bathroom where the cement tub had become encrusted with lime.</t6258> <t6259>He got rid of his old exotic clothes, fake perfumes, and cheap jewelry, spending all his money solely on the repairs.</t6259> <t6260>The only thing that concerned him in the other parts of the house were the statues of saints lined up in the altar.</t6260> <t6261>He threw them into a fire he lit in the garden one day and burned them to ashes.</t6261> <t6262>He slept until eleven in the morning.</t6262> <t6263>Then, putting on an old robe embroidered with golden dragons and slippers with yellow pompoms, he would go to the bathroom and stay there long enough to remind one of the Beautiful Remedios, bathing with great care.</t6263>
<t6264>Before entering the bathroom, he would pour the scented powders he carried in three jars made of marble into the bathtub, which was the size of a pool.</t6264> <t6265>He didn't pour water with a gourd, but instead, he would dive into the scented waters of the pool-like bathtub, lie on his back for two hours, and enjoy the coolness while thinking about Amaranta.</t6265>
<t6266>A few days after her arrival, she took off the taffeta dress, her only garment, which was unsuitable for the town's heat.</t6266> <t6267>Instead, she started wearing a tight pair of pants very similar to those worn by Pietro Crespi during his dance lessons, and a silk shirt made from vibrant cocoon silk, with her initials embroidered over her heart.</t6267> <t6268>Twice a week, she would take off her clothes, press them into a basin and wash them, and since she had nothing else to wear, she would wait in her bathrobe until they dried.</t6268>
<t6269>He wasn't eating his meals at home.</t6269> <t6270>When the midday heat subsided, he would go out and return late at night.</t6270> <t6271>Then, like a cat, he would start prowling around the room, hissing and panting, and circling Amaranta.</t6271>
<t6272>The memory that remained from home was only the memory of Amaranta and the statues of saints with their terrifying appearance in the light of the night lamp.</t6272> <t6273>In the August heat of Rome that drove people to dreams, he had woken up countless times in the middle of his sleep, and in a glorification stemming from being far away, he had seemed to see Amaranta, with her lace petticoats and the bandage on her wrist, emerging from a marble-edged pool.</t6273> <t6274>Unlike Aureliano Jose, who tried to drown the image of Amaranta in the bloody mire of war, Jose Arcadio, while distracting his mother with tales of divine service, also tried to keep this image alive in the pit of lust.</t6274> <t6275>Neither he nor Fernanda knew that the letters they wrote to each other were filled with mutual lies.</t6275>
<t6276>As soon as he arrived in Rome, Jose Arcadio, who had abandoned the faculty of theology, continued the tale of theology and canon law to avoid jeopardizing the legendary inheritance that would rescue him from the poverty mentioned in his mother's letters, which he shared with two friends in an attic in Trastevere.</t6276> <t6277>Upon receiving Fernanda's last letter, written as she was dying, he packed whatever remained of his ostentatious luxury into a suitcase and crossed the ocean in the hold of a ship filled with immigrants crammed together like sheep in a slaughterhouse, eating cold pasta and worm-infested cheese.</t6277> <t6278>Even before reading Fernanda's will, which was nothing more than a pretentious account of her sufferings and misfortunes, Jose Arcadio realized, upon seeing the broken furniture and the weeds covering the veranda, how he had been swindled, how he had fallen into a trap from which he would never escape, and that he would never again see the time-forgetting air and the brilliant sunshine of a Roman spring.</t6278>
<t6279>During the sleepless nights caused by his asthma, he wandered around the dark house, filled with fears by Ursula's senile words, constantly pondering the nature of the misfortune that had befallen him.</t6279> <t6280>To prevent losing Jose Arcadio in the darkness, Ursula had designated a specific corner of the bedroom for him and had not allowed him to leave this corner, the only place where he could stay away from the dead that filled the house after sunset.</t6280>
<t6281>Ursula used to say, "If you do something bad, the saints will inform me."</t6281>
<t6282>Jose Arcadio's fear-filled nights were spent in that corner, where he would curl up on a stool, sweating and trembling with fear under the glassy gaze of the saints until bedtime.</t6282> <t6283>This was an unnecessary torture.</t6283>
<t6284>Because Jose Arcadio was already a child who was afraid of everything around him and ready to be frightened by everything he would encounter in life.</t6284>
<t6285>His head was filled with a heap of horrors.</t6285> <t6286>They had taught him to fear everything created by God's infinite goodness and twisted by the devil's malice: the women on the street who would suck his blood, the women at home who bore children with pig tails, the cockfights that brought death to men and left the survivors in lifelong agony, the weapons that could start twenty-year wars with a single touch, the unknown adventures that led to disappointment and madness.</t6286> <t6287>On the mornings after nights when the devil entered his nightmares, the daylight and Amaranta's caresses in the bath, the comfort of the powder sprinkled between his legs, would dispel the fear he had felt at night.</t6287>
<t6288>Even Ursula would become completely different under the bright sun in the garden.</t6288> <t6289>Because when she was in the garden, she wouldn't talk about terrible things; she would take Jose Arcadio in front of her and rub his teeth with coal dust so that when he grew up and smiled, he would have bright teeth worthy of the Pope. She would cut and file his nails so that pilgrims flocking to Rome from all corners of the world would admire the beauty of the Pope's hands that blessed them. She would comb his hair in a manner befitting the Pope and sprinkle cologne on him so that his body and clothes would smell like the Pope's.</t6289> <t6290>When Jose Arcadio was in Rome, he had gone to the garden of Castel Gandolfo, and the only thing that caught the Pope's attention, who was making the same speech in seven different languages from the balcony to the crowd of pilgrims gathered there, was indeed the whiteness of his hands that looked as if they had been soaked in ash water, the dazzling brightness of his summer clothes, and his breath that absolutely smelled of cologne.</t6290>
<t6291>After a year had passed since his return home, Jose Arcadio's only solace, who had sold the silver candlesticks and the famous chamber pot - which was discovered to be thinly gold-plated at the time of sale - and squandered the money, was to gather the children from the street and let them play in the garden of the house.</t6291> <t6292>When nap time came, he would appear with a bunch of children, make them jump rope in the garden, sing songs on the veranda, perform acrobatics on the furniture in the living room, and he himself would move from one group to another teaching the children manners and etiquette.</t6292> <t6293>He had given up tight pants and silk shirts; he wore an ordinary outfit bought from the Arabs' shop, but he maintained his distant dignity and papal aura.</t6293>
<t6294>The children invaded the house, just as Meme's classmates once did.</t6294> <t6295>They chatted, sang, and danced until late at night.</t6295> <t6296>The house took on the appearance of an undisciplined boarding school.</t6296> <t6297>Aureliano did not mind the children crowding into the house as long as they did not disturb him in Melquiades' room.</t6297>
<t6298>One morning, two children opened the door of the room and were surprised to see a man with disheveled hair and beard, covered in dirt and grime, trying to tear apart manuscripts at the table.</t6298> <t6299>Although they did not dare to enter, they began to constantly watch the room.</t6299> <t6300>They were peeking through the cracks, whispering to each other, and throwing live animals inside through the window bars.</t6300> <t6301>Once, they even nailed the door and window shut.</t6301> <t6302>Aureliano had to struggle for half a day to open them.</t6302> <t6303>Encouraged by the lack of punishment for their mischief, four of the children burst into the room one morning while Aureliano was in the kitchen and prepared to tear the manuscripts.</t6303> <t6304>However, the moment they reached out their hands to the yellowed papers, a divine force lifted the children off the ground and held them in the air until Aureliano came and took the papers.</t6304>
<t6305>From that day on, the children never bothered Aureliano again.</t6305>
<t6306>The four oldest children, who were almost reaching puberty but still wore short pants, made it their task to emulate Jose Arcadio's appearance.</t6306> <t6307>They would arrive before the others, spending the entire morning shaving Jose Arcadio, massaging him with hot towels, trimming and polishing his fingernails and toenails, and applying cologne all over him.</t6307> <t6308>Occasionally, they would join him in the bath, and while Jose Arcadio lay on his back in the water dreaming of Amaranta, the children would soap and wash him from head to toe.</t6308> <t6309>Then they would dry him, powder him all over, and dress him.</t6309> <t6310>A child with curly blond hair and pink eyes like a rabbit was living in the house.</t6310> <t6311>The bonds that drew him close to Jose Arcadio were so strong that on nights when he couldn't sleep due to asthma attacks, the child would silently pace the dark house with him.</t6311>
<t6312>One night in Ursula's room, they saw a yellow light shining through the cracked cement.</t6312> <t6313>A subterranean sun seemed to have turned the room's floor into glass.</t6313> <t6314>They didn't even need to turn on the room's light.</t6314> <t6315>When they lifted the floorboards in the corner where Ursula's bed stood and where the glow was the most intense, they found the hole that Aureliano Segundo had exhausted himself digging up the garden to find.</t6315> <t6316>Three sacks with their mouths tied with copper wire and the seven thousand two hundred and fourteen gold coins inside them were glowing like embers in the dark.</t6316>
<t6317>The discovery of the treasure exploded like a fire breaking out unexpectedly.</t6317>
<t6318>When Jose Arcadio suddenly came into wealth, instead of returning to Rome as he had dreamed during his days of poverty, he turned his house into a paradise for the destitute.</t6318>
<t6319>She bought new velvets for the curtains and the canopy of the bed, laid mosaic on the bathroom floors, and tiled the walls.</t6319> <t6320>The buffet in the dining room overflowed with fruit preserves, hams, and pickles.</t6320> <t6321>The long-unused pantry was reopened, and it was stocked with various wines and liquors that Jose Arcadio had carried from the station in crates bearing his name.</t6321> <t6322>One night, Jose Arcadio and the four eldest children had a party that lasted until dawn.</t6322> <t6323>At six in the morning, they emerged from the room completely naked, emptied the pool of its water, and filled it with champagne.</t6323> <t6324>Then they all jumped into the pool together and began swimming like birds flying in the sky, covered in fragrant bubbles.</t6324>
<t6325>Jose Arcadio did not partake in this exuberance; he lay on his back in the water, dreaming of Amaranta.</t6325> <t6326>Until the children got tired and all went to the room together, Jose Arcadio remained withdrawn like this, pondering over indistinct pleasures.</t6326>
<t6327>In the meantime, the children pulled down the curtains to dry themselves, and while running around, they broke the large crystal mirror into four pieces; while saying they were going to bed, they tore the canopy of the bed.</t6327> <t6328>When Jose Arcadio came out of the bathroom, he found the children, completely naked, sleeping in a heap in the room that had turned into a disaster area.</t6328>
<t6329>More than the breaking and shattering of things, he was overcome with anger due to the pity and disgust he felt for himself in the emptiness of this revelry.</t6329> <t6330>He took out the hair shirt, the nine-knotted whip, and other instruments of remorse and punishment that he had hidden at the bottom of the chest.</t6330>
<t6331>Then, shouting like a madman and with a ruthless ferocity that one wouldn't even show while chasing a pack of jackals, he whipped the children and drove them out of the house.</t6331>
<t6332>Then he had an asthma attack.</t6332> <t6333>The attack, which lasted a few days, gave Jose Arcadio the appearance of someone on their deathbed.</t6333> <t6334>On the third night of this torment, unable to bear the coughing and breathlessness, he went to Aureliano's room and asked him to get a powder from the nearby pharmacy that would open his breath.</t6334> <t6335>Thus, Aureliano went out into the street for the second time.</t6335> <t6336>After crossing two streets, he entered the small pharmacy with dusty windows lined with bottles labeled in Latin and got the medicine, whose name Jose Arcadio had written on a piece of paper, from the salesgirl who had the beauty of a Nile serpent.</t6336> <t6337>Seeing the deserted town, barely illuminated by the yellow bulbs of the street lamps, for the second time did not arouse more interest in Aureliano than the first.</t6337>
<t6338>When Aureliano arrived, dragging his weakened and sluggish legs from being constantly confined and inactive, out of breath, Jose Arcadio had already lost hope of his return and had begun to think he had escaped.</t6338>
<t6339>Aureliano was so indifferent to the world that a few days later, Jose Arcadio broke the promise he had made to his mother and gave Aureliano permission to go out whenever he wanted.</t6339>
<t6340>Aureliano said, "I have no business outside."</t6340>
<t6341>Then he shut himself in his room again, buried in the manuscripts he slowly turned but could not yet comprehend: Jose Arcadio would bring him slices of ham and sugary flowers that left a taste of spring in the mouth after being eaten.</t6341> <t6342>Jose Arcadio was not interested in the manuscripts, which he described as an introspective way to kill time, but he admired his reclusive relative's rare intelligence and knowledge about the world.</t6342> <t6343>He was surprised to learn that Aureliano could read English and had read the six-volume encyclopedia from cover to cover like a novel while trying to decipher the manuscripts.</t6343> <t6344>At first, he attributed Aureliano's detailed descriptions of Aoma, as if he had lived there for years, to the knowledge he had gained from the encyclopedia.</t6344>
<t6345>But soon he realized that he also knew things that were not in the encyclopedia, like the prices of goods in the market.</t6345> <t6346>When he asked where he got this information, Aureliano simply replied, "Everything is known."</t6346> <t6347>Aureliano was also surprised at how different Jose Arcadio looked up close compared to the image he had formed of him while walking around the house.</t6347> <t6348>So Jose Arcadio knew how to laugh, and sometimes he could miss the old state of the house, feeling a pang of sorrow for the poverty of Melquiades' room.</t6348> <t6349>The relationship between these two people of the same blood could not be called friendship, yet this companionship made it easier for them to endure the boundless loneliness that both brought them closer and pushed them apart.</t6349> <t6350>Jose Arcadio handed over the household problems he couldn't manage to Aureliano.</t6350> <t6351>Aureliano would occasionally come out of his room to read books on the veranda, waiting for the letters Amaranta Ursula wrote without fail, and he could now use the bathroom that Jose Arcadio had initially forbidden him to enter when he first arrived.</t6351>
<t6352>On a warm dawn hour, they both jumped out of bed as the front door was pounded loudly.</t6352> <t6353>At the door stood a dark-skinned, elderly man with large green eyes that seemed to glow as if his face were phosphorescent, resembling a ghost.</t6353> <t6354>There was an ash cross mark on the man's forehead.</t6354> <t6355>His clothes were tattered.</t6355> <t6356>His shoes were torn.</t6356>
<t6357>He had no belongings other than a backpack.</t6357> <t6358>He looked like a beggar.</t6358> <t6359>Yet he possessed a dignity that was completely contrary to his appearance.</t6359> <t6360>To understand that the mysterious force keeping him alive was not the instinct to perpetuate his lineage but sheer fear, it was enough to just take a look at his face even in the emptiness of the living room.</t6360>
<t6361>This was Aureliano Amador, the only one of Colonel Aureliano Buendia's seventeen sons to survive the massacre, seeking a place to rest after years of weary fugitive life.</t6361> <t6362>He introduced himself.</t6362> <t6363>He asked to be taken into this house, which he had thought of as his last refuge in life during the years he had worked like a slave.</t6363> <t6364>Jose Arcadio and Aureliano did not recognize him.</t6364> <t6365>They threw him out into the street, thinking he was a vagabond.</t6365> <t6366>Then, they witnessed the end of a drama that had begun before Jose Arcadio was even old enough to understand.</t6366>
<t6367>Two policemen, who had been chasing Aureliano Amador for years, emerged from among the almond trees on the opposite sidewalk and fired two shots.</t6367>
<t6368>The bullets from their Mausers pierced through the ash cross.</t6368>
<t6369>Since Jose Arcadio had driven the children out of the house, he had been waiting for a ship that would depart for Naples before Christmas.</t6369> <t6370>He had even discussed this with Aureliano and had planned to set up a business to support him.</t6370> <t6371>Because after Fernanda's funeral, the supply of food baskets had stopped.</t6371> <t6372>But he couldn't realize this last dream either.</t6372>
<t6373>One September morning, while having his coffee in the kitchen with Aureliano, Jose Arcadio later went to the bathroom.</t6373> <t6374>As he was about to leave the bathroom, the four children he had thrown out of the house burst in through the gaps in the tiles and, without giving Jose Arcadio a chance to defend himself, grabbed him by the hair and jumped into the pool with him, submerging his head in the water. They held his head underwater until the bubbles of his last breath disappeared, and his motionless, pale body sank to the bottom of the fragrant waters like a dolphin.</t6374> <t6375>Then they took the three sacks of gold that only they and their victim knew about.</t6375> <t6376>All of this happened with methodical, swift, and precise movements, like a military maneuver.</t6376> <t6377>Aureliano, who had shut himself in his room, was unaware of anything.</t6377> <t6378>In the afternoon, when he couldn't see Jose Arcadio around, he searched the entire house.</t6378> <t6379>Finally, he found the bloated corpse, still dreaming of Amaranta, floating on the fragrant, mirror-like waters of the pool.</t6379> <t6380>It was only then that Aureliano realized how much he had begun to love him.</t6380>
<t6381>With the first angels of December, swept along by the winds that open the way for sailors, Amaranta Ursula set out, dragging her husband by the silk cord tied around his neck, and arrived unexpectedly, wearing an ivory-colored dress, a pearl necklace that reached her knees, topaz and emerald rings, and her hair done up in a bun held by sparrow tail pins.</t6381> <t6382>The man she had married six months earlier was a middle-aged, thin, sailor-type Fleming.</t6382> <t6383>As soon as Amaranta Ursula opened the door to the living room, she realized that her absence had lasted longer than she had thought and that this period had been more exhausting than she had imagined.</t6383>
<t6384>With more joy than sorrow, he exclaimed, "Oh my God!"</t6384> <t6385>"How obvious it is that there's no woman at home."</t6385>
<t6386>The items did not fit on the veranda.</t6386> <t6387>Besides the old trunk of Fernanda that she took with her when going to school, there were two trunks, four large suitcases, a suitcase where she put her umbrellas, eight hat boxes, a huge cage filled with fifty canaries, and her husband's bicycle piled up.</t6387>
<t6388>Since the bicycle was folded and placed in a special box, her husband carried it around like a cello.</t6388> <t6389>Amaranta Ursula did not rest for even a day after that long journey.</t6389> <t6390>As soon as she pulled on the old overalls her husband had brought along with his automatic tools, she set about putting the house in order.</t6390> <t6391>She repelled the army of red ants that had taken over the veranda, revived the rose bushes, cleared the weeds, and replanted ferns, begonias, and hydrangeas in the pots on the veranda railings.</t6391> <t6392>By supervising the carpenters, locksmiths, and masons she had gathered at the house, she had the cracks in the floors filled, the doors and windows re-hinged, the furniture repaired, and the interior and exterior of the house plastered and whitewashed. Three months after her arrival, she had restored the youthful and exuberant atmosphere of the days when the hurdy-gurdy played in the house.</t6392> <t6393>No one in the house had ever felt such constant happiness, enjoyed life so much regardless of the circumstances, or been so ready to dance, sing, and discard established habits as they did then.</t6393>
<t6394>As soon as Amaranta Ursula waved her broom, she swept away all the funeral remnants, piles of trash, and whatever charms, amulets, and prayers had accumulated in the corners.</t6394> <t6395>The only thing she didn't throw away out of respect for Ursula was the portrait of Remedios in the living room.</t6395> <t6396>While cleaning, she burst into laughter and screamed, "Oh my God! What luxury!"</t6396> <t6397>"A grandmother at fourteen!" When one of the masons said that the house was full of ghosts and the only solution to drive them away was to search for the buried treasures, Amaranta Ursula laughed and replied that it was unbecoming for men to be mired in superstition.</t6397> <t6398>Amaranta Ursula was such an independent and modern-spirited woman, so spontaneous and rule-breaking, that when Aureliano saw her coming, he didn't know how to hide his body exposed by his tattered clothes.</t6398>
<t6399>Amaranta, "Oh my dear little cannibal, how you've grown!" she said, and without giving him a chance to respond, she put a record on the portable gramophone and began to teach Aureliano how to dance.</t6399> <t6400>She took off the dirty pants that had belonged to Colonel Aureliano Buendia from Aureliano's back, gave him shirts suitable for young people, and two-tone shoes.</t6400>
<t6401>Whenever Aureliano would lock himself in Melquiades' room for a long time, Amaranta Ursula would come and get him, pushing and shoving him out onto the street.</t6401>
<t6402>Amaranta Ursula, who was as industrious, petite, and indomitable as Ursula, and almost as enchanting as Beautiful Remedios, also had the ability to foresee future fashion trends.</t6402> <t6403>When the latest fashion magazines arrived by mail, she would see that the clothes she had previously designed and sewn on Amaranta's old pedal machine did not contradict the latest fashion innovations.</t6403> <t6404>She subscribed to all the fashion magazines, art publications, and popular music magazines published in Europe.</t6404> <t6405>When she glanced through these, she saw that the happenings in the world were exactly as she had envisioned them.</t6405>
<t6406>It was hard to understand why a woman with her temperament, especially one who had enough money to live as she pleased anywhere in the world and a husband who loved her enough to endure her putting a silk leash around his neck and pulling him along, would return to this lifeless town mired in dust and heat.</t6406>
<t6407>As time passed, it became increasingly clear that Amaranta Ursula intended to stay there.</t6407> <t6408>Because none of her plans were short-term; whatever she did was always in preparation for a peaceful and serene old age in Macondo.</t6408> <t6409>The canary cage proved that these preparations were carried out with spontaneous impulses.</t6409>
<t6410>Amaranta Ursula remembered her mother mentioning in a letter that the birds had died, postponed their journey for a few months until she found a ship heading to the Canary Islands, and then bought twenty-five pairs of canaries to revive the skies of Macondo.</t6410> <t6411>Among Amaranta Ursula's futile efforts, this was the one she put the most effort into.</t6411> <t6412>As the birds multiplied, Amaranta Ursula released them in pairs.</t6412> <t6413>However, the moment the birds gained their freedom, they would escape from Macondo and fly to other places.</t6413> <t6414>Amaranta Ursula tried in vain to evoke a sense of love in the birds by using a cage that Ursula had made during the first renovation of the house.</t6414> <t6415>The nests woven from alpha grass that she placed in the almond trees did not work, nor did scattering birdseed on the nests, nor did making the caged birds sing to lure back the ones that had escaped.</t6415> <t6416>Those that left the cage would immediately escape after drawing a large circle over Macondo to determine the direction of the Canary Islands.</t6416>
<t6417>Although a year had passed since Amaranta Ursula's return, she had not yet made any friends or organized any gatherings, but she had not lost hope of bringing together the community that misfortunes had driven into solitude.</t6417> <t6418>Her husband Gaston, even though he understood that his wife's decision to settle here was the result of a mirage created by longing from the very moment they got off the train at that deadly noon hour, was still doing his best not to oppose her.</t6418> <t6419>Since he had no doubt that his wife would become disheartened as she faced reality, he did not feel the need to take his velocipede out of its box and spent his time searching for the largest eggs among the spider webs that the masons had torn down.</t6419> <t6420>He would separate the eggs he found with his fingernail, then take a magnifying glass in his hand and examine the tiny spiders inside the eggs for hours.</t6420>
<t6421>Later on, when he concluded that Amaranta Ursula was continuing the repair work just to keep herself busy, he decided to take his flashy bicycle, with a front wheel larger than the rear wheel, out of its box.</t6421> <t6422>Then, driven by the passion to send all the local insects he could find in the area to his natural history professor at the University of Liege, where he studied entomology in addition to his main profession of aviation, he started catching them and putting them in jam jars.</t6422> <t6423>When he went out riding his bicycle, he wore tight acrobat pants, fancy socks, and a Sherlock Holmes cap on his head.</t6423> <t6424>When he went for a walk, he wore light linen clothes, white shoes, a straw hat, a silk scarf, and carried a cane.</t6424> <t6425>His light-colored eyes emphasized his sailor appearance, and his small mustache resembled a squirrel's tail.</t6425>
<t6426>Despite being at least fifteen years older than his wife, his meticulous determination to make her happy and his skill in lovemaking made the age difference disappear.</t6426> <t6427>In fact, those who saw this man in his forties, who had meticulous habits, with a circus-worthy bicycle and a leash tied around his neck, would never imagine that he was in an unconditional love agreement with his wife, that they followed their lovemaking instincts whenever and wherever they felt like it, and that they made love with a passion that had been deepening and enriching since the beginning of their relationship, through time and extraordinary circumstances.</t6427>
<t6428>Gaston was not only a lover with boundless intellect and imagination, but perhaps the first man to make an emergency landing with his plane to make love in a field of violets, bringing himself and his lover to the brink of death.</t6428>
<t6429>Two years before their marriage, Gaston and Amaranta Ursula met when Gaston was performing loops in his biplane over her, and in an attempt to avoid hitting the flag, he made an impossible maneuver, causing the plane's primitive fabric wings and aluminum tail to get caught in the electric wires.</t6429> <t6430>From that day on, Gaston, undeterred by his leg being in a cast, began taking Amaranta Ursula from the convent where she stayed, which was not as strict as Fernanda had hoped, to his countryside cabin on weekends.</t6430>
<t6431>They fell in love with each other in the market air of the fields and five hundred meters above the ground.</t6431> <t6432>As the creatures on the earth below them grew smaller, they grew closer.</t6432> <t6433>Amaranta Ursula described Macondo to Gaston as the sunniest, most peaceful town in the world.</t6433> <t6434>She spoke of a large house filled with the scent of geraniums, where she wanted to live happily for the rest of her life with her devoted husband and two sons, whom she would name Rodrigo and Gonzalo—not Aureliano and Jose Arcadio—and a daughter, whom she would name Verginia—not Remedios.</t6434> <t6435>She was idealizing the town with such longing that Gaston sensed that if he did not let her live in Macondo, she would not marry him.</t6435>
<t6436>He agreed to settle in Macondo, thinking it was a temporary whim that would eventually be forgotten.</t6436> <t6437>However, after two years in Macondo, when Amaranta Ursula did not lose her initial happiness and cheerfulness, Gaston began to worry.</t6437>
<t6438>During that time, he had cut all the insects in the vicinity that could be cut, learned Spanish as if it were his native language, and solved all the puzzles in the magazines that came by mail.</t6438> <t6439>He couldn't even use the climate as an excuse to hasten their return.</t6439> <t6440>Because nature had given him the sluggishness of siesta hours and a colonial-type liver that could withstand worm-infested water.</t6440> <t6441>He loved the local food so much that he sometimes ate eighty-two iguana eggs in one sitting.</t6441> <t6442>Amaranta Ursula, on the other hand, could only eat fish and shellfish brought in ice boxes by train, and canned meat and fruit.</t6442> <t6443>She still dressed like Europeans, ordering clothing models by mail even though there was nowhere to go and no friends to see.</t6443>
<t6444>Her husband no longer had any interest in her short skirts, upturned hats, and seven-strand necklaces.</t6444> <t6445>It was necessary to attribute Amaranta Ursula's perseverance, her tirelessness, her constant busyness, and her efforts to solve the household problems she created herself.</t6445> <t6446>She was doing a heap of tasks superficially or ruining them and then persistently tackling the same tasks again the next day.</t6446> <t6447>Seeing her in this state, it was impossible not to recall Fernanda's opinion that in this family, turning tasks into a game of trial and error was an ailment passed down from generation to generation.</t6447> <t6448>Her enthusiasm was so vibrant that as soon as a new record arrived, she would immediately call Gaston and practice the dances her friends had drawn and sent to her.</t6448> <t6449>After dancing until late hours, they would finish the night by making love either on Viennese rocking chairs or on the floor.</t6449> <t6450>The only thing Amaranta Ursula was waiting for to complete her happiness was to have children.</t6450> <t6451>However, she was waiting out of respect for the agreement she had made with her husband not to have children before the fifth year of their marriage.</t6451>
<t6452>Gaston, who was looking for a hobby to fill his empty hours, started spending his mornings with the shy Aureliano in Melquiades' room.</t6452> <t6453>He enjoyed reminiscing about his own country with him, talking about Aureliano's country, which he knew in detail as if he had lived there for years.</t6453> <t6454>When Gaston asked where he had obtained so much information that wasn't found in the encyclopedia, he received the same answer that Jose Arcadio had gotten: "Everything is known."</t6454> <t6455>Aureliano had learned English and French in addition to Sanskrit, and had also picked up Latin and Greek.</t6455> <t6456>At that time, because he went out on the street every day and Amaranta Ursula gave him a weekly allowance, Aureliano's room had come to resemble a branch of the Catalonian's shop.</t6456> <t6457>He read continuously until late at night.</t6457> <t6458>However, from the way Aureliano talked about the books he read, Gaston believed that he was reading not to learn, but to verify the accuracy of his own knowledge.</t6458> <t6459>Moreover, none of the books he read interested him as much as the manuscripts he pored over from morning till noon.</t6459>
<t6460>Gaston and his wife wanted to include him in the family's life.</t6460> <t6461>However, Aureliano was a reclusive person, shrouded in an ever-thickening cloud of mystery.</t6461>
<t6462>Whatever Gaston did to get close to him, he couldn't achieve any result, so he sought other consolations to fill his idle hours.</t6462> <t6463>That's when he thought of establishing an airmail service.</t6463> <t6464>This was not a new idea.</t6464>
<t6465>Actually, Gaston had already developed this plan quite a bit by the time he met Amaranta Ursula.</t6465> <t6466>However, at that time, he was considering it not for Macondo, but for the Belgian Congo, where his family had invested in palm oil.</t6466> <t6467>Deciding to get married and stay in Macondo for a few months to please his wife had postponed the realization of this plan.</t6467> <t6468>But when Amaranta Ursula firmly decided to revitalize Macondo and mocked her husband about returning, Gaston realized that their stay here would last longer than he had thought. Since the goal was to pioneer a useful endeavor, he reconnected with his partners in Brussels, thinking that whether it was Africa or the Caribbean, it didn't matter.</t6468> <t6469>While his work and plans progressed on one hand, on the other, he transformed the old enchanted region, which had turned into a plain full of broken flint, into an airport.</t6469>
<t6470>He researched the direction of the winds, the geography of the coastal region, and the most suitable routes for air travel.</t6470> <t6471>He didn't know that these observations, reminiscent of Mister Herbert's work, made the townspeople suspicious, giving the impression that his intention was not to build roads but to plant banana trees.</t6471> <t6472>Gaston clung to this project, which would at least justify his permanent stay in Macondo, with all his might; he went to the provincial capital several times, met with officials, obtained the necessary permits, and made agreements that ensured all rights would belong to him.</t6472> <t6473>Meanwhile, he was corresponding with his partners in Brussels, in a manner reminiscent of Fernanda's correspondence with the invisible doctor.</t6473>
<t6474>In the end, they persuaded them to send the first airplane under the supervision of a skilled worker.</t6474> <t6475>This skilled worker would assemble the airplane at the nearest airport and fly it to Macondo.</t6475> <t6476>A year after Gaston started working and making meteorological calculations, he developed a habit of believing in the promises made in the letters, pacing the streets, looking up at the sky, and hoping at the slightest sound of a breeze that the airplane might be coming.</t6476>
<t6477>Amaranta Ursula's return home had completely changed Aureliano's life.</t6477> <t6478>Amaranta Ursula was not even aware of this change.</t6478> <t6479>After Jose Arcadio's death, Aureliano had become a regular customer of the wise Catalonian.</t6479> <t6480>The sense of freedom and the ability to spend his time as he pleased had sparked a certain interest in the town, and he had come to know and understand it without being surprised by anything he saw.</t6480> <t6481>He wandered through the desolate, dusty streets, examined the interiors of ruined houses with scientific curiosity, and carefully observed the rusted window bars, dead birds, and townspeople bent under the weight of memories.</t6481> <t6482>He tried to imagine the former glory days of the old Banana Company site, now filled to the brim with decayed men's and women's shoes, and a dry swimming pool.</t6482> <t6483>During these explorations, he found the skeleton of a shepherd dog chained to a ring with a steel chain.</t6483> <t6484>He came across a constantly ringing telephone.</t6484> <t6485>The phone rang and rang, and finally, Aureliano answered it; a woman's voice speaking English came from deep within.</t6485> <t6486>Aureliano told the woman that the strike was over, three thousand corpses had been thrown into the sea, the Banana Company had left, and Macondo had found peace after many years.</t6486>
<t6487>These strolls brought him to the red-light district, once a place where bundles of banknotes were burned to fuel the revelry, now filled with streets more wretched and miserable than the others.</t6487> <t6488>In a few of the lanterns, red lights were still glowing.</t6488> <t6489>In the empty dance halls where dried wreaths dragged on the ground, pale-faced, plump French grandmothers and Babylonian madams, who had never been widowed by anyone, were still waiting by the gramophones.</t6489>
<t6490>Aureliano did not encounter anyone who knew his lineage, not even Colonel Aureliano Buendia, except for the oldest of the West Indian natives.</t6490>
<t6491>An elderly native with hair like cotton, giving his face the appearance of a photo negative, continued to sit at his door and sing evening hymns.</t6491>
<t6492>Aureliano was speaking in the broken local language he had learned in a few weeks with the man, and sometimes he would join the man in eating chicken head soup made by the man's great-grandchild.</t6492> <t6493>The local's great-grandchild was a broad-shouldered, wide-hipped, melon-breasted black woman with a round head surrounded by curly hair that resembled the chainmail coifs of medieval warriors.</t6493> <t6494>Her name was Nigromanta.</t6494> <t6495>In those days, Aureliano was getting by by selling the silverware, candlesticks, and other small items in the house.</t6495> <t6496>When he was mostly penniless, he would sweet-talk the scavengers at the back of the market to get the chicken heads they were going to throw away and take them to Nigromanta to make soup with purslane and mint.</t6496>
<t6497>After the great-grandfather died, Aureliano stopped visiting their house.</t6497> <t6498>He would encounter Nigromanta under the dark-shaded almond trees, whistling like wild animals to chase away the owls.</t6498> <t6499>Often, he would stand beside her, talking in the native language about chicken head soup and other aspects of poverty, and he would stay until the woman told him that his presence was scaring away her customers.</t6499> <t6500>Although Aureliano sometimes felt a desire within him and Nigromanta seemed to him like the accumulation of a shared sense of nostalgia, he never slept with her.</t6500>
<t6501>That's why when Amaranta Ursula came to Macondo and embraced Aureliano in a sisterly manner, taking his breath away, Aureliano's hand had never touched a woman's hand before.</t6501> <t6502>Whenever Aureliano saw Amaranta Ursula, especially when she tried to teach him the latest dances, his bones would collapse as if they were a sponge being squeezed, just like his great-grandfather's knees buckled in front of Pilar Ternera, who used the excuse of playing cards in the granary.</t6502>
<t6503>Aureliano buried himself a bit more in the manuscripts to escape this torment and began to avoid the pure interest of this aunt who poisoned his nights.</t6503> <t6504>But the more he avoided the woman, the more he eagerly awaited her muffled laughter rising at the most unexpected hours and from the most unlikely places in the house, her purring with satisfaction like a cat in the climax of her lovemaking, and her cheerful songs.</t6504> <t6505>One night, while the couple was frolicking on the workbench in the silver workshop, ten meters away from Aureliano's bed, they knocked over and broke the bottles on the bench with the shaking of their unhinged bodies, and they completed their lovemaking in the pool of spilled hydrochloric acid.</t6505> <t6506>Aureliano couldn't sleep all night, and moreover, he spent the next day crying with rage and burning with fever.</t6506> <t6507>The first night Aureliano waited for Nigromanta in the shade of the almond trees seemed to drag on endlessly.</t6507>
<t6508>Aureliano felt a tingling all over his body with excitement and doubt, clutching the fifty cents he had from the peso he asked from Amaranta Ursula.</t6508>
<t6509>He had taken the money not because he needed it, but to involve Amaranta Ursula in this matter, to humiliate her, to, in a way, turn her into a prostitute in this adventure.</t6509> <t6510>Nigromanta took Aureliano to her room, illuminated by pretentious candelabras and stained with the marks of sordid loves, and gave him her hardened, soulless body.</t6510> <t6511>This body, which was preparing to dismiss Aureliano like a timid child, suddenly encountered a strong man seeking harmony with the vibrations emanating from within.</t6511>
<t6512>They began to make love.</t6512> <t6513>Aureliano spent his mornings deciphering manuscripts, and when it was time for a nap, he would go to the room where Nigromanta was waiting for him.</t6513> <t6514>The woman first taught him to make love like worms, then like snails, then like crabs, and finally, she would leave him to wait to be loved like bandits.</t6514> <t6515>A week after they started making love, Aureliano noticed that the woman had a thin belt around her waist, as hard as steel, resembling a cello string.</t6515> <t6516>The belt had no end; it was as if it had been wrapped around her waist at birth, growing and expanding with her.</t6516>
<t6517>Almost always, in between their lovemaking, they ate, lying naked in bed, snacking under the zinc roof that shone like daytime stars amidst the drug-like heat and rust stains.</t6517>
<t6518>For the first time, Nigromanta had a steady lover, a man who, as she laughingly put it, loved her from head to toe with bone-cracking intensity.</t6518>
<t6519>Nigromanta was gradually succumbing to romantic fantasies.</t6519> <t6520>Meanwhile, Aureliano confessed his secret passion for Amaranta Ursula to her.</t6520> <t6521>His lovemaking with Nigromanta had not made him forget this passion; on the contrary, as his experiences broadened his horizons of love, his passion began to twist and knot inside him.</t6521>
<t6522>Even after Aureliano revealed his secret love, Nigromanta continued to treat him with the same closeness and warmth, but she never missed a penny of the money she received for her services.</t6522> <t6523>When Aureliano had no money, Nigromanta would add another mark to the tally she kept behind the door, rather than writing it down in a ledger.</t6523>
<t6524>As the sun set, Nigromanta would go out to wander in the shadows of the field, while Aureliano, usually at that hour, would slip into the veranda like a stranger without even greeting Amaranta Ursula and Gaston, who were typically having dinner.</t6524> <t6525>Then he would lock himself in his room, unable to read, write, or even think due to the excitement he felt from the sounds of laughter, whispers, flirtations, coquetry, and ultimately the bursts of happiness that filled the house at night.</t6525> <t6526>Two years before Gaston started waiting for the airplane, Aureliano's life was already like this, and it was the same on the day he went to the wise Catalonian's bookstore.</t6526> <t6527>That day, when Aureliano entered the store, there were four talkative children inside engaged in a discussion about medieval methods of killing cockroaches.</t6527> <t6528>The old bookseller, knowing Aureliano's interest in old books, mischievously drew him into the discussion with a fatherly cunning.</t6528>
<t6529>Aureliano immediately began to recount what he knew on the subject.</t6529> <t6530>He explained that the cockroach is the oldest species of winged insect on earth, that even in the Old Testament there is mention of these insects being crushed by sandals, but that these creatures are very resilient and that all the killing methods tried, from tomatoes mixed with borax to sugary flour, have failed, that there are exactly one thousand six hundred and three different species of these animals that have resisted the oldest and most relentless war humans have waged against all kinds of living creatures since the world began, that if the primary fundamental instinct of humans is the urge to reproduce, the second should be considered the urge to kill cockroaches, that cockroaches save themselves by hiding in dark places, taking advantage of the human natural fear of darkness, but in doing so, they have also become unable to withstand the midday sun, and that since the Middle Ages, the most effective way to kill cockroaches, per omnia secula seculorum, has been sunlight, he rattled off in one breath.</t6530>
<t6531>This encyclopedic information marked the beginning of a great friendship.</t6531>
<t6532>Aureliano began meeting in the afternoons with these children named Alvaro, German, Alfonso, and Gabriel, who were the first and last friends he made in his life.</t6532> <t6533>For someone like Aureliano, buried in written truths, these noisy, argumentative revelries that started in the bookstore and ended in brothels at dawn were an unprecedented novelty.</t6533> <t6534>As Alvaro mentioned during one of these night revelries, the idea that literature was the best amusement invented to mock people had never occurred to Aureliano until that day.</t6534> <t6535>After a while, Aureliano realized that the wise Catalan was the one who exemplified this carefree behavior.</t6535>
<t6536>The Catalan was a person who believed that a mind incapable of finding a new way to cook chickpeas was worthless.</t6536>
<t6537>The night of the day Aureliano gave a speech to the cockroaches ended among the girls who sold their bodies to fill their stomachs in a brothel on the outskirts of Macondo.</t6537> <t6538>The madam who ran the house was a cheerful woman, eager to open and close doors.</t6538> <t6539>Looking at her ever-present smile, one might think she was laughing at the customers' naivety, mocking them for believing this place, which existed beyond dreams, was real.</t6539>
<t6540>Because even the tangible objects in the house were far from being real; when you sat on the couches, they would fall apart, a chicken had made a nest inside the broken gramophone, the flowers in the garden were made of paper, the calendars on the walls showed years from before the arrival of the Banana Company, pictures cut out from never-published magazines were framed and hung up.</t6540>
<t6541>When Mama announced the arrival of customers, even the timid little whores from the surrounding houses would come out.</t6541> <t6542>They would enter without greeting, wearing their shrunken, floral dresses from five years ago, and take them off as innocently as they had put them on. In the heat of passion, they would cry out, 'Oh my God, the ceiling is about to collapse,' and as soon as they received their one and a half pesos, they would run straight to Mama to spend the money on the cheese pastries she sold.</t6542> <t6543>Mama would grin again, knowing that even the pastries weren't real.</t6543> <t6544>During that time, Aureliano, whose world began with Melquiades' manuscripts and ended in Nigromanta's bed, overcame his shyness in this small, dreamlike brothel.</t6544>
<t6545>At first, in the rooms where the mother would burst in at the most beautiful moment of lovemaking and enumerate her daughters' hidden charms, Aureliano could not achieve anything.</t6545> <t6546>But over time, he got so used to these inevitable troubles of the world that one night, more unbalanced and more reckless compared to other nights, he stripped completely naked in the small sitting room and walked around the entire house balancing a beer bottle on his astonishingly large male organ.</t6546> <t6547>It was Aureliano who made these wild entertainments, which the mother participated in with that constant smile, without ever resisting and without ever believing, a fashionable trend.</t6547>
<t6548>Even when German, claiming that the house didn't actually exist, tried to set it on fire to prove his point, and when Alfonso tore off the parrot's neck and threw it into the boiling chicken stew, mama's smile never changed.</t6548>
<t6549>Although Aureliano was bound to the four friends with a common love and solidarity, and sometimes saw them as a single person, he still felt closer to Gabriel than to the others.</t6549> <t6550>This closeness was born on the evening when Aureliano spoke of Colonel Aureliano Buendia and only Gabriel took him seriously.</t6550> <t6551>Even mama, who usually did not participate in conversations, opposed him, fiercely arguing that there was no such person as Colonel Aureliano Buendia, whom she had once heard of, and that the government had invented such a name as an excuse to kill the Liberals.</t6551> <t6552>However, Gabriel had no doubt that Colonel Aureliano Buendia had really lived.</t6552> <t6553>Because the colonel was both a comrade-in-arms and a close friend of his great-grandfather, Colonel Gerineldo Marquez.</t6553>
<t6554>When it came to talking about the killing of the workers, the forgetfulness of those around him would reach its peak.</t6554> <t6555>Whenever Aureliano brought up the subject, neither his mother nor the older people would accept what Aureliano said; they claimed that the workers trapped at the station and the train with two hundred carriages full of corpses were just a myth, that everything was documented in legal records, even included in elementary school books, and they insisted that the Banana Company had never been established.</t6555> <t6556>Thus, Aureliano and Gabriel grew closer through a bond based on truths that no one believed.</t6556> <t6557>These truths had so profoundly affected their lives that they both remained in a world that had ended and was only longed for, while the everyday world receded with the ebbing waters, leaving them in this realm.</t6557> <t6558>Gabriel would sleep wherever he happened to be.</t6558>
<t6559>Aureliano laid him down several times in the silver workshop.</t6559> <t6560>However, Gabriel, disturbed by the noise of the dead wandering around the bedrooms until morning, could not sleep at all.</t6560> <t6561>Later, Aureliano entrusted Gabriel to Nigromanta.</t6561> <t6562>When Nigromanta was free, she would take him to her overly used room, and behind the door, she kept track of Gabriel's tally in the places left uncovered by Aureliano's debts.</t6562>
<t6563>Despite their irregular lifestyles, the entire group started constantly trying to do something, driven by the insistence of the wise Catalonian.</t6563> <t6564>The Catalonian, enriched by the experiments that came from once being a professor of classical literature and his shop filled with rare books, led them, and in this town where no one read beyond elementary school, he made five youths research what the thirty-seventh dramatic situation was until morning.</t6564> <t6565>Aureliano, enchanted by the magic of discovering what is called friendship and reaching the beauties of a world forbidden by Fernanda's wicked heart, stopped working on the manuscripts just as they were beginning to unravel as prophecies woven into encrypted poetic verses.</t6565> <t6566>However, as time passed and he realized that there was enough time for everything without giving up the brothels, he returned to Melquiades' room with the decision not to abandon his efforts before finding the final clues by deciphering the writings.</t6566>
<t6567>At that time, Gaston had dedicated himself to waiting for the plane, and Amaranta Ursula was suffocating from loneliness.</t6567> <t6568>One morning, she entered Aureliano's room and said, "Hello, wild one."</t6568> <t6569>"I see you've returned to your cave again, huh?"</t6569>
<t6570>She had an irresistible appearance with the dress she designed herself and the necklace she arranged herself that extended down to her belly.</t6570> <t6571>Since she now firmly believed in her husband's loyalty to her, she had loosened the reins and, for the first time since she arrived, she seemed to have some free time.</t6571>
<t6572>Aureliano realized he had entered the room without needing to see him.</t6572>
<t6573>Amaranta Ursula rested her elbows on the table.</t6573> <t6574>She looked so helpless, she was so close that Aureliano could hear the voice coming from within her bones.</t6574> <t6575>Amaranta Ursula was interested in the manuscripts.</t6575>
<t6576>Aureliano, trying to overcome his nervousness, clung desperately to his fading voice, his ebbing life, and his memories turning into a petrified mass of coral. He spoke to Amaranta Ursula about the fate of Sanskrit, how in the light of time the future could be read just as writings on the back of a paper held up to the light could be read in reverse, how prophecies needed to be deciphered to prevent them from destroying themselves, about Nostradamus's centuries, and Saint Milanus's foretelling of the destruction of Cantabria.</t6576> <t6577>At one point, without pausing his speech, Aureliano placed his hand on Amaranta Ursula's, driven by an instinct that had been dormant within him since birth and thinking it would put an end to the doubts of his firm decision.</t6577>
<t6578>Amaranta Ursula, just as she did in her childhood, caught his index finger with innocence and did not let go as long as Aureliano answered her questions.</t6578> <t6579>They sat for a long time with their icy index fingers intertwined, sharing nothing with each other.</t6579> <t6580>Finally, Amaranta Ursula woke from her momentary reverie and slapped her hand on her forehead.</t6580> <t6581>-Ants! she exclaimed.</t6581> <t6582>She forgot about the manuscripts and everything, ran to the door dancing, and blew a kiss to Aureliano with her fingertips, just as she had done to her father the day they sent her to Brussels.</t6582>
<t6583>"You can tell me about these later," he said.</t6583> <t6584>"I forgot that I needed to pour lime into the ant nests today."</t6584>
<t6585>After that day, whenever she had tasks on the side of the house where Aureliano's room was, she would stop by to see him, and while her husband continued to study the sky, Amaranta Ursula also began to linger for a few minutes by Aureliano's side.</t6585>
<t6586>Encouraged by this change, Aureliano started joining the family table, which he had been avoiding since the first months of Amaranta Ursula's arrival.</t6586> <t6587>This pleased Gaston.</t6587>
<t6588>In his conversations that lasted more than an hour after the meal, he kept complaining that his partners were deceiving him.</t6588> <t6589>His partners had informed him that they had loaded the plane onto a ship, whereas no such ship had ever arrived.</t6589> <t6590>And even though the shipping agency insisted that such a ship would never come because it would not operate on the Caribbean route, his partners claimed they had loaded the plane onto a ship that would come there, even accusing Gaston of lying.</t6590> <t6591>The correspondence became so filled with mutual suspicion and accusations that Gaston eventually began to consider going to Brussels for a short time to receive the plane and return.</t6591> <t6592>However, when Amaranta stated that she was determined not to step out of Macondo even at the cost of losing her husband, the topic of the plane was never brought up again.</t6592> <t6593>In the early days, like everyone else, Aureliano also saw Gaston as a crackpot with a velocipede, looking at him with vague pity.</t6593> <t6594>Later, as he frequented brothels and got to know men better, he thought that Gaston's quiet demeanor stemmed from an unrestrained lust.</t6594>
<t6595>When she got to know Gaston closely and realized that his real personality was completely opposite to his mild-mannered appearance, she began to suspect that even Gaston's waiting for the plane was an act.</t6595> <t6596>Gaston was not as scatterbrained as he appeared; on the contrary, he must have been extremely consistent, very calculating, talented, and infinitely patient.</t6596> <t6597>He wasn't pressuring his wife to accept his wishes; he must have been trying to wear her down by exhausting her.</t6597> <t6598>Without opposing anything, without saying no or impossible to anything, he was showing endless compliance, patiently waiting for his wife to tire of the emptiness of the dreams she had built, to catch herself in the trap, pack her bags, and decide to return to Europe on her own.</t6598> <t6599>Aureliano's old feeling of pity was replaced by great anger and hatred.</t6599> <t6600>Gaston’s method seemed very wrong to him, but also very effective.</t6600> <t6601>In the end, he decided to warn Amaranta Ursula.</t6601>
<t6602>Amaranta Ursula mocked his doubts without ever noticing the weight of love, indecision, and jealousy in his heart.</t6602>
<t6603>Until the moment when Amaranta Ursula cut her finger while opening a can of peaches one day, and Aureliano rushed to suck her blood with a fervor and passion that made her marrow shiver, the woman did not realize that she had aroused a feeling in him beyond brotherly love.</t6603> <t6604>That day, trying to laugh amidst the unease of having her finger sucked, she said, 'Aureliano.'</t6604> <t6605>'You are too suspicious to be a good bat.'</t6605>
<t6606>Then Aureliano opened up his heart.</t6606> <t6607>He held Amaranta Ursula's injured hand, kissed her palm, and revealed the deepest corners of his heart.</t6607> <t6608>He told her how he would get up at midnight, wrap himself in the clothes Amaranta Ursula had left in the bathroom to dry, and cry in anger and loneliness.</t6608>
<t6609>He told how he made Nigromanta purr like a cat, how he whispered Gaston, Gaston, Gaston into her ear, and how he stole Amaranta Ursula's perfumes and applied them to the necks of little whores who sold their bodies to avoid starvation.</t6609>
<t6610>Frightened by this outburst of emotion, Amaranta Ursula began to clench her fingers, making her wounded hand into a fist like a closing clam.</t6610> <t6611>Eventually, she felt neither pain nor compassion.</t6611> <t6612>Her hand turned into a knot woven from topazes and emeralds, petrified and insensitive little bones.</t6612>
<t6613>Amaranta Ursula spoke as if spitting: "Idiot!" she said.</t6613> <t6614>"I'm leaving on the first ship bound for Belgium."</t6614>
<t6615>One evening in those days, Alvaro came to the wise Catalonian's shop, shouting at the top of his lungs to announce his latest discovery: He had found a zoological brothel.</t6615> <t6616>This place, called the Golden Child, was a huge open-air salon.</t6616> <t6617>Inside, there were over two hundred bittern birds that responded to those asking for the time with deafening cackles.</t6617> <t6618>Among the large Amazon camellias in the wire cages surrounding the dance floor, various colored herons, crocodiles as fat as pigs, twelve-rattled snakes, and a bright-shelled water turtle diving in and out of a small artificial lake roamed around.</t6618>
<t6619>There was also a big, white, male, and pederast dog.</t6619> <t6620>But when it came to filling its belly, the dog would forget all about pederasty and even do the breeding job.</t6620> <t6621>The atmosphere of the salon was as dense as the clouds surrounding a newly created world.</t6621> <t6622>The mixed beauties, waiting in despair among the blood-red flowers and outdated gramophone records, knew the methods of lovemaking that humans had forgotten in the earthly paradise.</t6622> <t6623>On the first night the young men went to this dream greenhouse, the beautiful and silent old woman who was cutting tickets at the door, sitting on a swing chair, thought time had reversed and returned to the old days when she saw the tall, slender young man with high cheekbones like the Tatars and the traces of an endless loneliness etched into his face like pockmarks among the five youths.</t6623>
<t6624>"Oh my God!" he sighed.</t6624> <t6625>"Aureliano!"</t6625>
<t6626>Long before the wars, long before the fame and glory, long before the desolation of disappointment, at dawn when he entered his room and gave the first command of his life, the command to love her, he saw Colonel Aureliano Buendia in the light of the lamp.</t6626>
<t6627>The woman at the door was Pilar Ternera.</t6627> <t6628>Years ago, when she turned one hundred and forty-five, she had given up the harmful and bad habit of calculating her age, and had begun to live in the static and unchanging time of memories, surpassing the hidden traps of the future in the cards.</t6628>
<t6629>Starting from that evening, Aureliano sought refuge in the affection, tenderness, and understanding of his great-grandmother whom he had never met.</t6629> <t6630>Pilar Ternera would sit in her rocking chair, reminiscing about the old days, reviving the family's glorious periods and the disasters that befell them, as well as the magnificent days of Macondo that had long faded away.</t6630> <t6631>Meanwhile, Alvaro would scare the crocodiles with his loud laughter, Alfonso would make up stories about bittern birds that gouged out the eyes of four customers who had behaved inappropriately a week earlier, and Gabriel would be in the room of the quiet and pensive angel girl.</t6631> <t6632>This girl did not take money for her services but would have letters written to her smuggler lover who was imprisoned on the opposite bank of the Orinoco.</t6632> <t6633>Her lover had been caught by border guards, and when the seat they forcibly placed him on suddenly filled with filth and diamonds, they threw him into a hole.</t6633> <t6634>This place, a true brothel with a nurturing mama, was exactly the world Aureliano had dreamed of during his years of captivity.</t6634>
<t6635>She was so happy there, she felt so close to perfect friendship that when Amaranta Ursula's dreams were shattered, she couldn't think of any other place to seek refuge.</t6635> <t6636>She was ready to pour out her heart and tell everything, hoping someone would untangle the knots choking her chest, but all she could do was collapse into Pilar Ternera's arms and cry for a long time.</t6636> <t6637>Pilar Ternera waited for her crying to stop, gently scratching her head with her fingertips, and even before Aureliano could explain that he was crying from the pain of love, Pilar recognized the oldest tears in human history.</t6637>
<t6638>"These things happen, my child," she said.</t6638> <t6639>"Now tell me, who was it?"</t6639>
<t6640>When Aureliano spoke, Pilar Ternera burst into that old, coquettish laugh that spread like the cooing of doves.</t6640> <t6641>There could be nothing in the heart of a Buendia that she could not understand or unravel.</t6641> <t6642>Because a century filled with cards and experiments had taught her that the history of this family was nothing but repetition, an inevitable cycle, a wheel turning infinitely until its axis wore out.</t6642>
<t6643>Smiling, "Don't worry at all," he said.</t6643> <t6644>"Wherever you are right now, he is surely waiting for you."</t6644>
<t6645>When Amaranta Ursula came out of the bathroom, it was half-past four.</t6645>
<t6646>Aureliano saw her passing in front of his room, with her robe flowing in soft curves and the towel wrapped around her head like a turban.</t6646>
<t6647>He tiptoed, staggering from drunkenness, following the woman, and entered the bedroom.</t6647> <t6648>Amaranta Ursula, who was about to take off her bathrobe, closed it fearfully.</t6648> <t6649>Aureliano silently pointed to the adjacent room, whose door was ajar, knowing that Gaston was writing a letter there.</t6649>
<t6650>Amaranta Ursula, without making a sound and only moving her lips, said, "Go."</t6650>
<t6651>Aureliano smiled.</t6651> <t6652>He lifted Amaranta Ursula by her waist like a begonia pot, laid her down on the bed on her back.</t6652> <t6653>Without giving the woman a chance to resist, he swiftly pulled off her robe, and the color of her skin, her hairs, the moles in unseen places, all of which had been imagined in the dimness of other rooms, made his head spin in the depth of this freshly washed nakedness.</t6653> <t6654>Amaranta Ursula, defending herself in a manner befitting a smart woman, twisted her slender body, which resembled a slippery, flexible, fragrant poppy stem, trying to kick Aureliano's kidneys and scratch his face.</t6654> <t6655>But neither of them made a sound, making no more noise than someone watching the setting of the April sun through an open window.</t6655> <t6656>It was a relentless struggle, a deadly clash.</t6656>
<t6657>However, since it consisted of abrupt attacks, heavy, silent, measured movements, it seemed as if there was no struggle.</t6657> <t6658>During all this tussle, the petunias found the opportunity to bloom, and in the adjacent room, Gaston could easily forget his aviation dreams.</t6658> <t6659>They were like two enemy lovers at the bottom of an aquarium, searching for ways to reconcile.</t6659>
<t6660>During this relentless and ceremonial struggle, Amaranta Ursula realized that her silence was irrational and unbelievable, and that it would irritate her husband even more than the sounds of the struggle they were trying to prevent.</t6660>
<t6661>Without parting her tightly closed lips, she began to laugh, refusing to give up the struggle, and pretended to bite Aureliano in an attempt to defend herself.</t6661> <t6662>Her writhing gradually subsided.</t6662> <t6663>There came a moment when both of them realized that they were both enemies and accomplices, and the struggle turned into a familiar playfulness.</t6663> <t6664>Then, suddenly, as if she were playing a game, as if she were acting out a new tantrum, Amaranta Ursula let herself go and, frightened by what she had allowed, tried to regain her composure, but it was too late.</t6664>
<t6665>A great tremor left him motionless at the center of his own gravity, pinned him to the spot, and his instinct for self-defense was crushed and obliterated by the curiosity of learning the orange whistles and invisible spheres beyond death.</t6665> <t6666>He only had enough time to reach out, grab a towel, and clamp it between his teeth to stop the cat-like growls that were starting to tear through him.</t6666>
<t6667>Pilar Terriera, during one of the revelry nights, died in her swing chair while guarding the gates of her heaven.</t6667> <t6668>In accordance with her last wish, she was buried not in a coffin but in her swing chair, which eight people lowered with ropes into a deep pit dug in the middle of the dance floor.</t6668> <t6669>Girls dressed in black, their faces pale from crying, created a sort of religious ceremony by taking off their earrings, brooches, and rings and throwing them into the pit.</t6669> <t6670>Then the pit was covered with a lid that bore neither name nor birth and death dates, and it was covered with a heap of Amazon camellias.</t6670> <t6671>After poisoning the animals, the girls bricked up the windows and doors, took their wooden chests covered with images of saints, photos cut from magazines, and pictures of former lovers who were declared diamond rats, cannibals, or kings of gamblers, and scattered to the four corners of the world.</t6671>
<t6672>It had finally come.</t6672> <t6673>At Pilar Ternera's grave, among hymns and cheap whore jewelry, the remnants of the past would also decay, and after the departure of the wise Catalonian who sold his shop at auction and returned to his Mediterranean village with a longing for endless springs, whatever remained from the old days would all merge with the soil at Pilar Ternera's grave.</t6673> <t6674>No one could have predicted that the wise Catalonian would come to such a decision.</t6674> <t6675>The Catalonian had fled from one of countless wars, arrived in Macondo during the most tumultuous days of the Banana Company, and couldn't think of a more practical way to make a living than opening a bookstore that sold old books in various languages and antique first editions that customers waiting in line to enter the dream interpretation house across the street could browse through as if they were second-hand books.</t6675> <t6676>He spent half of his life at the back of the shop, meticulously filling pages torn from school notebooks with his purple ink writings; no one could ever definitively understand what he had written.</t6676>
<t6677>When Aureliano first met him, the wise Catalonian had filled two chests with papers covered in intricate writing that, in a way, reminded him of Melquiades' manuscripts.</t6677>
<t6678>After their meeting, he filled a third chest until he left.</t6678> <t6679>When one saw these chests full of writings, one couldn't help but think that the wise Catalonian had done nothing but write during his stay in Macondo.</t6679> <t6680>The only people he constantly interacted with were four friends.</t6680> <t6681>He made them abandon their kites and tops, put books in their hands, and had them read Seneca and Ovidius while they were still in elementary school.</t6681> <t6682>He knew the classical writers as intimately as members of his own family, as if he had once lived with them in the same room.</t6682> <t6683>He knew impossible-to-know things, like Saint Augustine not taking off the woolen undershirt he wore under his clothes for fourteen years, or the magician Arnoldo from Villanova losing his sexual potency because of a scorpion sting in his childhood.</t6683> <t6684>His passion for written information was a mix of solemn, serene respect and loquacious irreverence.</t6684>
<t6685>Even his own writings could not escape this dilemma.</t6685> <t6686>Alfonso, who had learned the Catalan language to translate the writings, took a bundle of these papers and stuffed them into his pockets, which were always filled with newspaper clippings and various brochures.</t6686> <t6687>One night, he lost those papers in the house of the little prostitutes who sold their flesh out of hunger.</t6687> <t6688>When the wise old man heard about this incident, instead of getting angry and scolding as the children feared, he burst into laughter, saying that this was the natural fate of literature.</t6688> <t6689>Nevertheless, no force could prevent him from taking three chests full of these writings with him when he returned to his birthplace.</t6689> <t6690>After hurling unrepeatable curses at the train conductors who wanted to throw the chests into the freight car, he managed to take the chests with him and place them in the passenger car.</t6690> <t6691>And he said, "If people travel in first class while literature is thrown into the freight car, it means the world has gone to hell."</t6691>
<t6692>These were the last words heard from the mouth of the Wise Catalonian.</t6692>
<t6693>He had gone through a tough week to complete the travel preparations.</t6693> <t6694>As the departure day approached, on one hand, his joy was fading, and on the other hand, he couldn't find what he was looking for where he had put it, everything was getting mixed up, as if the spirits that haunted Fernanda were now swarming around him.</t6694>
<t6695>"Damn all twenty-seven canons of the Council of Londar," he was swearing.</t6695>
<t6696>German and Aureliano took close care of him.</t6696> <t6697>They prepared him like a child, pinning his tickets and immigration documents to his pockets with safety pins.</t6697> <t6698>They made a detailed list of what he should do from the moment he left Macondo until the moment he landed in Barcelona.</t6698>
<t6699>Despite all this, the Catalonian unknowingly lifted and threw away his underwear, which had half of his money wrapped inside.</t6699> <t6700>On the night before his departure, after nailing the crates and packing his clothes into the old suitcase he had brought on his first arrival, the wise Catalonian squinted his eyes like a seashell and, pointing to the pile of books he had endured during his exile here, said to his friends, "I leave all this junk to you!"</t6700>
<t6701>The young men received twenty-nine letters and more than fifty drawings that the Catalonian had written and collected during his free time on the journey, three months later.</t6701> <t6702>Although he hadn't dated his letters, the order in which he wrote them was clear.</t6702> <t6703>In the first letters, with his usual playful and cheerful manner, he talked about the hardships of the sea voyage; he described in detail how he restrained himself from throwing the cargo officer, who didn't want to put his paper trunks in his cabin, into the sea, the stupidity of the woman who was terrified of being assigned to cabin number thirteen—not because she believed it was unlucky, but because she was scared that the number had no end—and how he won a bet because he knew that the drinking water served on the ship had a taste of beets from the Lerida spring waters.</t6703> <t6704>However, as the days passed, the realities of life on the ship interested him less and less, and as the ship progressed, his memories began to cause him pain, making even the most insignificant event or the smallest detail evoke a longing for home.</t6704>
<t6705>This longing's development was clearly evident in the pictures.</t6705>
<t6706>In the first pictures, with the snowy peaks of the Caribbean October visible behind him, he had a happy appearance with his snow-white hair and a sports shirt resembling hospital pajamas.</t6706> <t6707>In the last pictures, however, with a dark jacket on his back and a silk scarf, he looked as if he was stuck in silence from loneliness on the deck of this melancholic ship advancing like a sleepwalker in the autumn seas.</t6707> <t6708>German and Aureliano replied to his letters.</t6708> <t6709>In the first months, the Catalonian was writing letters so frequently that German and Aureliano felt closer to him than when he was in Macondo, and they forgot their sorrows.</t6709> <t6710>Initially, the Catalonian wrote that everything was the same, that the pink snakes were still wandering in the house where he was born, that the dried herring placed on toasted bread still tasted the same, and that the waterfall in the village smelled wonderful as evening fell.</t6710>
<t6711>He was again filling the pages torn from the notebook with his purple ink writing, dedicating a paragraph to each of the young men.</t6711> <t6712>The healthy and vigorous air in the Catalonian's letters, without him even realizing it, began to transform into a pastoral quality that signaled the breaking of the spell.</t6712> <t6713>One night, while the soup was boiling on the stove, he suddenly longed for the suffocating heat behind his shop, the sun hitting the dusty almond trees, and the whistle of the train tearing through the drowsiness of siesta hours.</t6713> <t6714>When he was in Macondo, he had missed the winter soup boiling on the stove, the cries of the coffee vendor, and the larks flying in flocks in the spring just like this.</t6714> <t6715>Overwhelmed between these two longings, which faced each other like two mirrors, the Catalonian lost that unique surreal feeling and began to advise the children in his letters to leave Macondo, to forget all the teachings about the world and the human heart, to defy Horace, to remember that the past is a lie no matter where they are, that memories have no return, that no passing spring can ever be recaptured, and that the most wild and indispensable love is a momentary reality at the end of life.</t6715>
<t6716>Alvaro was the first to heed the advice to leave Macondo.</t6716> <t6717>He sold off everything he had, including his pet tiger that roamed his garden and scared passersby, and bought a ticket for a train that would never stop, valid forever.</t6717> <t6718>In the postcards he sent along the way, he described the fleeting images seen from the compartment window.</t6718> <t6719>It was as if he were tearing up a long poem quickly forgotten and casting it into the void of oblivion.</t6719> <t6720>The imaginary black people in the cotton fields of Louisiana, the winged horses in the blue pastures of Kentucky, the Greek lovers making love in the hellfire-like sunset of Arizona, the girl in a red sweater painting a watercolor by the shore of a lake in Michigan and waving at Alvaro with the hand holding the brush—all were parts of this poem.</t6720> <t6721>The girl had waved her hand not in farewell, but with hope, unaware that the train had no return.</t6721>
<t6722>Then one Saturday, Alfonso and German left with the intention of returning on Monday.</t6722> <t6723>But no one ever saw them again, nor did any news come.</t6723> <t6724>A year after the departure of the wise Catalonian, Gabriel was the only one of the four friends remaining in Macondo.</t6724> <t6725>Gabriel was surviving thanks to Nigromanta's benevolence and was continually answering the questions of a contest organized by a French magazine, which offered a free trip to Paris as a prize for the winner.</t6725> <t6726>Aureliano, who was subscribed to the magazine, helped Gabriel fill out the answers, sometimes at his house but mostly at the only pharmacy in Macondo, where Gabriel's secret lover Mercedes lived, working among ceramic bottles and the smell of medicines.</t6726> <t6727>The pharmacy was the only thing from the past that had not disappeared.</t6727> <t6728>Because it was consuming itself, constantly coming to an end but never quite reaching the end of its process of disappearance.</t6728>
<t6729>The town had sunk into such a stupor and stagnation that when Gabriel won the contest and was about to set off for Paris with two sets of underwear, a pair of shoes, and all of Rabelais's books, he had to signal the engineer himself to stop the train so he could get on.</t6729> <t6730>Old Turks Street had turned into a desolate ruin.</t6730> <t6731>Only the last remaining Arabs were visible.</t6731> <t6732>Even though years had passed since they sold their last yard of cloth and nothing remained in the shaded shop windows but mannequins with broken necks, they sat in front of their doors, waiting to be dragged to death without breaking their century-old habits.</t6732> <t6733>In place of the Banana Company site, which Patricia Brown might have described like a fairy tale to entertain her grandchildren on nights when she was bored eating dill pickles in Pratville, Alabama, there stretched a plain covered with wild weeds as far as the eye could see.</t6733> <t6734>While lizards and mice were fighting over the church's inheritance in one corner, the old priest who had replaced Father Angel and whose name no one had bothered to learn was lying in his hammock, writhing from arteriosclerosis and insomnia brought on by doubt, waiting for God's mercy.</t6734>
<t6735>In the vast Macondo, where birds had completely forgotten, and dust and heat had intensified to the point of taking one's breath away, and in the vast house, cut off from the world by the loneliness of love and affection, where there was no possibility of sleeping due to the noise of red ants, the only creatures who were happy were Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula.</t6735> <t6736>They were the happiest beings on earth.</t6736>
<t6737>Gaston had returned to Brussels.</t6737> <t6738>After getting tired of waiting for the plane, he packed his most necessary belongings into a small suitcase, took his letter file with him, and set out with the hope of taking the plane and returning before a group of German pilots who had presented a more favorable plan to the authorities than his own were granted a work permit.</t6738> <t6739>After the first day Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula made love, they continued their silent lovemaking during their meetings, which were almost always unexpectedly interrupted, taking advantage of Gaston's rare moments of absent-mindedness.</t6739>
<t6740>But when they suddenly found themselves all alone at home, they were swept up in the enthusiasm of lovers trying to make up for all the lost time.</t6740> <t6741>It was a wild, unchained lust that made Fernanda's bones ache in her grave and kept the two lovers in a constant state of excitement and arousal.</t6741> <t6742>Amaranta Ursula would scream and moan on the dining table at two in the afternoon, just as she would moan and scream in the pantry at two in the morning.</t6742> <t6743>Laughing, she would say, -What pains me the most is that we have lost so much time.</t6743>
<t6744>In the intoxication of passion and lust, losing himself, he watched as the ants ravaged the garden, satisfied their insatiable hunger by gnawing at the beams of the house, and as the ant flood, spreading like live lava, covered the veranda again, but he only endured the trouble of dealing with the ants that entered the bedroom.</t6744> <t6745>Aureliano also put aside the manuscripts, never stepped out of the house again, and began to respond randomly to the letters from the wise Catalonian.</t6745>
<t6746>They lost their sense of reality, their concept of time, and the order of their daily habits.</t6746> <t6747>To avoid wasting time undressing, they covered all the doors and windows and started wandering around the house as Beautiful Remedios once desired, lying and rolling naked in the mud of the garden.</t6747> <t6748>One day, while trying to make love in the cistern, they almost drowned.</t6748> <t6749>In a short time, the damage they caused overshadowed that of the red ants.</t6749>
<t6750>They smashed and broke the furniture in the living room, tore apart the hammock that had endured Colonel Aureliano Buendia's painful, encampment loves during their frenzied lovemaking, shredded the mattresses, and made love breathlessly amidst the cotton scattered on the floor.</t6750> <t6751>Although Aureliano, like his rival, was a wild and passionate lover, it was Amaranta Ursula's mad genius and insatiability that ruled in this disastrous paradise.</t6751> <t6752>It was as if Amaranta Ursula had concentrated all the tireless energy that her great-grandmother had spent on making animal-shaped sweets into her love.</t6752> <t6753>However, as Amaranta Ursula laughed and sang with joy at the love games she discovered, Aureliano became increasingly withdrawn and silent.</t6753> <t6754>Because his passion was inward and burning.</t6754> <t6755>Yet they pushed their skills to such extremes that when they were exhausted from excitement, they took advantage of their fatigue.</t6755> <t6756>They devoted themselves to worshipping their bodies, discovering countless new possibilities of lovemaking even during their rest periods, and found these to be much richer, more colorful, and intense than mere passion.</t6756>
<t6757>While Aureliano rubbed Amaranta Ursula's erect nipples with egg white or massaged her flexible hips and peach-like belly with cocoa butter, Amaranta Ursula played with his enormous organ like a baby, drawing clown eyes on its tip with lipstick, putting on a mustache with an eyebrow pencil, tying organza ribbons as ties, and dressing it with tin foil hats.</t6757> <t6758>One night, they covered each other from head to toe in peach marmalade and licked like dogs, then made love on the veranda.</t6758> <t6759>Later, they woke up to the noise of a voracious ant swarm preparing to eat them alive.</t6759>
<t6760>When they took a break from their lovemaking frenzies, Amaranta Ursula would respond to Gaston's letters.</t6760> <t6761>She saw Gaston as being so far away and so absorbed in his work that she didn't even consider his return.</t6761>
<t6762>In one of his first letters, Gaston wrote that his partners had indeed sent the plane, but due to a mistake by the shipping agent in Brussels, the plane had been delivered to the Makondo tribe in Tanganyika.</t6762> <t6763>This mix-up had caused so many difficulties that it could take up to two years just to retrieve the plane.</t6763> <t6764>Upon receiving this news, Amaranta Ursula dismissed the possibility of her husband's early return from her mind.</t6764>
<t6765>Aureliano's connection with the world persisted only through the letters from the wise Catalonian and the news he received from Gabriel via the pharmacist Mercedes.</t6765> <t6766>Initially, these communications were of a genuine nature.</t6766> <t6767>Gabriel had decided to stay in Paris and had returned his return ticket.</t6767> <t6768>Now, he was making a living by selling old newspapers and empty bottles discarded by the room attendants from a gloomy hotel on Dauphine Street.</t6768> <t6769>Aureliano imagined him on the sidewalks of Montparnasse, in the cafés, with a fisherman's turtleneck sweater that he took off when the spring breeze blew; he envisioned Gabriel sleeping during the day and writing at night to confuse the hunger in that cauliflower-boiling-smelling room where Rocamadour would die.</t6769>
<t6770>However, as the news from Gabriel became increasingly vague and the letters from the wise Catalonian began to take on a melancholic and disorganized tone, Aureliano started to see them as distant memories, much like how Amaranta Ursula thought of her husband.</t6770>
<t6771>Thus, Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano remained suspended in an empty universe where the only daily and eternal truth was love.</t6771>
<t6772>In this world of blissful abandon, the news of Gaston's return caused an unexpected panic.</t6772> <t6773>Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula opened their eyes, searched the depths of their souls, pressed their hands to their hearts as they looked at the letter, and realized that they were so close to each other that they would rather die than part.</t6773> <t6774>Upon this, Amaranta Ursula wrote a letter to her husband filled with contradictory truths, explaining how much she loved him and how happy she was to see him again, but that as a fate of destiny, she could not live without Aureliano.</t6774> <t6775>Contrary to their expectations, they received an extremely calm, almost fatherly letter from Gaston.</t6775> <t6776>For two pages, Gaston warned them about the transience and uncertainty of passions, and as he concluded the letter, he wished them happiness in proportion to the joy he had experienced in his own brief marriage.</t6776>
<t6777>Gaston’s attitude was so unexpectedly peculiar that Amaranta Ursula, feeling that her husband was looking for an excuse to abandon her to her fate and that she had unwittingly provided him with that excuse, concluded that she had been humiliated.</t6777> <t6778>Six months later, when Gaston wrote from Leopoldville mentioning that he had finally acquired his airplane and asking for his bicycle, the only item of sentimental value he had left in Macondo, Amaranta Ursula's anger flared up again.</t6778> <t6779>Aureliano patiently endured Amaranta Ursula’s wrath and tried to prove that he could be as good a husband in times of hardship as he had been in times of plenty.</t6779> <t6780>When Gaston’s last bit of money ran out, the daily necessities that arose created a bond of solidarity between the two of them.</t6780> <t6781>While this bond was not as intoxicating as their initial passion, it still allowed them to make love and be happy as they had in the early days of their relationship.</t6781>
<t6782>When Piler Ternera died, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula were expecting a baby.</t6782>
<t6783>During the lethargy of her pregnancy, Amaranta Ursula tried making and selling necklaces made from fish spines.</t6783> <t6784>But aside from Mercedes, who bought a dozen necklaces, she found no buyers.</t6784>
<t6785>Aureliano was realizing for the first time that his ability to learn languages, his encyclopedic knowledge, and his power to remember details about places he had never been and events from long ago were as useless as the jewels his wife possessed, which were more valuable than all the money that the people remaining in Macondo could gather.</t6785> <t6786>They were living by a miracle.</t6786> <t6787>Although Amaranta Ursula had not lost her cheerfulness and her genius for mischievousness, she had acquired the habit of sitting on the veranda after meals, thoughtful and as if she had fallen into a wakeful sleep.</t6787> <t6788>Aureliano would sit with her.</t6788> <t6789>Sometimes, they would sit facing each other, looking into each other's eyes and loving each other as passionately as they did in their most fervent days, staying on the veranda until dusk fell.</t6789>
<t6790>The uncertainty of the future had turned their hearts to the past.</t6790> <t6791>They see themselves in the lost paradise of great rains, recalling their dives into the puddles in the garden, killing lizards to hang on Ursula, attempting to bury Ursula alive, and these memories proved to them the fact that they had been happy together since they could remember.</t6791>
<t6792>When Amaranta Ursula delved into older memories, she recalled the day she entered the silver workshop and what her mother had said.</t6792> <t6793>Her mother had said that Aureliano was nobody's child, that they had found him floating in a basket.</t6793>
<t6794>Although these words did not seem plausible to either of them, Aureliano had no other information that could replace this story regarding his identity.</t6794>
<t6795>After reviewing all the possibilities, the only thing they knew for sure was that Fernanda was not Aureliano's mother.</t6795> <t6796>Amaranta Ursula thought that Aureliano could be the son of Petra Cotes, about whom she had only heard disgraceful stories, and the more she thought about it, the more her heart wrenched with horror.</t6796>
<t6797>Unable to bear the torment of believing that he was his wife's brother, Aureliano went to the church to look through the archives, which were moldy in places and moth-eaten in others, in the hope of finding something about who his parents were.</t6797> <t6798>The oldest baptism certificate he found was one given to Amaranta Buendia, who was baptized as an adult girl by Father Nicanor Reyna, who tried to prove the existence of God with chocolate magic tricks.</t6798> <t6799>While scanning the four volumes where the records were kept, Aureliano thought he was one of the seventeen Aurelianos he encountered in the population records; however, the baptism dates of these Aurelianos extended far back compared to his own age.</t6799> <t6800>The priest, who was suffering from arteriosclerosis and watching him from where he lay, felt pity for Aureliano when he saw that he was lost in the genealogical labyrinths and trembling with the horror of uncertainty, and asked for his name.</t6800>
<t6801>-Aureliano Buendia, said Aureliano.</t6801>
<t6802>The priest replied firmly, "Then don't bother," he said.</t6802> <t6803>"Years ago, there was a street with that name here, and in those days, people had the habit of naming their children after street names."</t6803>
<t6804>Aureliano began to tremble with anger.</t6804>
<t6805>"So, you don't believe it either," he said.</t6805>
<t6806>-What do I not believe in?</t6806>
<t6807>-That Colonel Aureliano Buendía fought in exactly thirty-two civil wars and lost every one of them.</t6807> <t6808>That soldiers cornered three thousand workers at the station and mowed them down with machine guns, and that the bodies were loaded onto a two-hundred-car train and dumped into the sea.</t6808>
<t6809>The priest scrutinized him with pitying eyes.</t6809>
<t6810>"Ah, my son," he sighed.</t6810> <t6811>"Right now, it is enough for me to know for certain that you and I exist."</t6811>
<t6812>Thus, Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula accepted the basket tale, not because they believed in it, but because it saved them from being terrified.</t6812>
<t6813>As the pregnancy progressed, they grew closer to each other, becoming a single entity, merging into one being within the loneliness of the house that would collapse at the slightest puff.</t6813> <t6814>They had retreated to the very limited part of the house that was sufficient for them.</t6814> <t6815>They stayed in Fernanda's bedroom, making love and gazing at each other without moving from their spots.</t6815> <t6816>They also made use of a section of the veranda.</t6816> <t6817>Here, Amaranta Ursula would sit and sew bonnets and booties for the baby to be born, while Aureliano would write replies to the letters occasionally sent by the wise Catalonian.</t6817> <t6818>The rest of the house was left to the relentless assault of decay.</t6818> <t6819>The silver workshop, Melquiades' room, and the primitive and silent world of Santa Sofia de la Piedad remained in the depths of this domestic jungle, where no one dared to enter.</t6819>
<t6820>Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano, surrounded by the insatiability of nature, continued to cultivate hydrangeas and begonias, and were preparing their defensive lines by digging the last trenches of the century-old war between man and ants with lime.</t6820> <t6821>Her long and unkempt hair, the pregnancy spots on her face, the swelling of her legs, the deterioration of her once slender body that used to writhe while making love, had distanced Amaranta Ursula from the youthful state she had when she first came home with the unfortunate canaries and her love-struck husband, but it had not changed the liveliness and wildness of her spirit.</t6821> <t6822>"What a shitty job, huh!" she laughed, "Who would have thought that we would end up living like real savages!" she said.</t6822>
<t6823>With the arrival of the letter they received in the sixth month of pregnancy, which was immediately apparent not to have come from the wise Catalonian, the last tie binding them to the world was severed.</t6823> <t6824>It had been posted from Barcelona.</t6824> <t6825>The envelope was written in conventional ink and an official handwriting.</t6825> <t6826>It had the indifferent and impersonal appearance characteristic of bad news.</t6826>
<t6827>Just as Amaranta Ursula was about to open the envelope, Aureliano snatched it from her hand.</t6827>
<t6828>"Don't open this envelope," he said.</t6828> <t6829>"I don't want to know what it says."</t6829>
<t6830>As Aureliano sensed, the wise Catalonian never wrote another letter.</t6830> <t6831>The letter from that stranger, which no one read, was left to the mercy of moths on a shelf where Fernanda once forgot her engagement ring, and it remained there, destroying itself with the burning fire of the bad news it carried.</t6831> <t6832>The lovers who were left alone surrendered themselves to the swelling waves of the final stages, caught in the current of those regretless, ill-fated days that embarked on the unnecessary effort of dragging them towards the desert where the spell was broken and forgetfulness began.</t6832> <t6833>Amaranta Ursula and Aureliano, aware of the danger hovering over them, spent their last months holding hands and nurturing love for the child that would be born during the period when their bond, conceived in the madness of incest, was absolute.</t6833>
<t6834>They slept holding each other at night and were not frightened by the earthly sounds like the noise of ants, the rustling of moths, or the constant whisper of the weeds enveloping the adjacent rooms.</t6834> <t6835>But often, they would wake up from sleep due to the comings and goings of the dead.</t6835> <t6836>They heard Ursula fighting against the laws of nature to continue her lineage, Jose Arcadio Buendia searching for the legendary truth of great inventions, Fernanda praying, Colonel Buendia bewildered among the deceptions of war and fish, and Aureliano Segundo dying of loneliness amidst the chaos of his debaucherous revelries.</t6836>
<t6837>Then they learned that great passions could endure despite death, and they were very happy when they realized that even long after other animal species emerged that would one day take the paradise of misery stolen by insects from humans away from the insects, they would continue to love each other as ghosts.</t6837>
<t6838>One Sunday afternoon at exactly six o'clock, Amaranta Ursula went into labor.</t6838> <t6839>The always-smiling mama of the girls who sold their bodies to avoid starvation laid Amaranta Ursula on the dining table, spread her legs apart, and sat on her belly, pressing down on it until Amaranta Ursula's screams were drowned out by the cries of a magnificent baby boy.</t6839> <t6840>Through her tears, Amaranta Ursula saw that her son was one of the burly Buendías, strong and indefatigable like all the José Arcadios, observant and intuitive like all the Aurelianos.</t6840> <t6841>This child would restart the lineage and cleanse it of all evils and loneliness, for he was the only person in a century to be conceived in love.</t6841>
<t6842>Amaranta Ursula, "This is a real wild one," she said.</t6842> <t6843>"Let's name him Rodrigo."</t6843>
<t6844>Her husband objected, "No."</t6844> <t6845>"We will name him Aureliano and Aureliano will win exactly thirty-two battles."</t6845>
<t6846>Then, after cutting the child's umbilical cord, they began to wipe off the bluish, greasy filth covering the child's belly with a cloth under the light of the lamp Aureliano was holding.</t6846> <t6847>When they turned the child onto his stomach, they noticed that he had one more thing than the other boys.</t6847> <t6848>They bent down to look.</t6848> <t6849>It was a pig's tail.</t6849>
<t6850>They did not panic.</t6850> <t6851>Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula did not know the family tradition, nor did they remember Ursula's terrifying warnings.</t6851> <t6852>The midwife calmed them by saying that the tail could be cut off when the child grew its second tooth.</t6852> <t6853>In any case, they did not find time to think about this matter again, because Amaranta Ursula began to bleed profusely.</t6853> <t6854>They tried to stop the bleeding by placing cobwebs and lumps of ash, but it was like trying to plug a gushing spring with a finger.</t6854> <t6855>Amaranta Ursula tried to maintain her cheerfulness in the early hours.</t6855> <t6856>She held the hand of Aureliano, who was gripped by fear, told him not to worry, explained that people like her did not die unless they wanted to, and laughed heartily at the old wives' remedies applied by the midwife.</t6856> <t6857>However, as Aureliano's hope diminished, Amaranta Ursula seemed to fade, as if the light on her was dimming.</t6857> <t6858>In the end, she lost consciousness.</t6858>
<t6859>They brought a woman with strong breath at dawn on Monday, who recited prayers to stop the bleeding.</t6859> <t6860>But Amaranta Ursula's passionate blood was insensitive to any kind of sorcery that did not derive its source from love.</t6860> <t6861>After grappling with despair for twenty-four hours, they realized towards the evening that she had died, because the bleeding stopped on its own, Amaranta Ursula's nose elongated, the spots on her face disappeared, and her skin took on the dullness of water marble.</t6861> <t6862>She seemed to be smiling again.</t6862>
<t6863>Aureliano had never understood until that moment how much he loved his friends, how much he missed them, and what he would give to be with them at that moment.</t6863> <t6864>He laid the child in the basket prepared by his mother, covered the face of the corpse with a blanket, then wandered around the town looking for a door that opened to the past.</t6864> <t6865>He knocked on the door of the pharmacy he hadn't visited recently.</t6865> <t6866>A carpenter's shop had opened in place of the pharmacy.</t6866> <t6867>The old woman who opened the door of the carpenter's shop, after holding the lamp in her hand up to his face and looking at him, pitied his ramblings and insisted that there had never been a pharmacy there and that she had never known a girl named Mercedes with a slender neck and dreamy eyes.</t6867> <t6868>Aureliano began to cry, leaning his forehead against the door of the wise Catalonian's old shop.</t6868> <t6869>With these belated tears, he realized he was paying his debt to a deceased person he couldn't cry for in time to avoid breaking the spell of love.</t6869>
<t6870>Without paying any attention to the orange-colored, bright rings passing through the sky, which he had watched with childlike admiration in the garden full of woodcocks during the old revelry nights, he pounded on the cement-covered door of the Golden Boy and called out to Pilar Ternera.</t6870> <t6871>In the last open hall of the red-light district, which had been devastated, a group was playing the accordion and singing the songs of Rafael Escalona, the nephew of the bishop and heir to the secrets of Francisco the Devil Teaser.</t6871> <t6872>The bartender, whose arm had shriveled and dried up because he had raised his hand against his mother, invited Aureliano to drink cane liquor.</t6872> <t6873>Aureliano bought him a drink.</t6873> <t6874>The bartender told him what had happened to his arm.</t6874> <t6875>Aureliano then told him what had happened to his heart, which had shriveled and dried up because he had fallen in love with his sister.</t6875> <t6876>In the end, they began to cry together, and for a moment, Aureliano felt as if their pain had ceased.</t6876>
<t6877>However, as the last dawn of Macondo broke, he stood in the middle of the field once again alone, raised his arms to the sides, and shouted with all his might as if he wanted the whole world to hear: -A friend is nothing but a bunch of scoundrels!</t6877> <t6878>Nigromanta saved him just as he was about to drown in a pool of vomit and tears.</t6878> <t6879>She took Aureliano to his room, cleaned him up, and gave him hot broth to drink.</t6879> <t6880>Then, in the hope of comforting him, she took a piece of charcoal and scribbled down old love debts, and to not leave Aureliano alone in his tears, she started crying and pouring out her own troubles.</t6880> <t6881>Aureliano briefly passed out and slept.</t6881> <t6882>When he woke up, he had a headache.</t6882> <t6883>He opened his eyes, and at that moment, the thought of the child crossed his mind.</t6883>
<t6884>He couldn't find the basket.</t6884> <t6885>At first, he was happy, thinking that Amaranta Ursula had woken up from the sleep of death to look after the child.</t6885> <t6886>However, his wife's corpse lay under the blanket like a heap of stones.</t6886> <t6887>Remembering that he had found the bedroom door open when he arrived, Aureliano passed through the veranda filled with the morning breath of hydrangeas, looked into the dining room where the large basin left from the birth, the bloody sheets, the jars filled with ashes, the umbilical cord lying in the middle of the cloth next to the fishing line and scissors on the table had not yet been cleared away.</t6887> <t6888>The thought that the midwife might have come at night and taken the child gave him a moment of relief to think.</t6888> <t6889>He sat in the rocking chair where Rebeca had sat while giving embroidery lessons in the early days of the house, where Amaranta had sat playing Chinese checkers with Colonel Gerineldo Marquez, and where Amaranta Ursula had sat sewing the baby's clothes, and in that brief moment of gathering his thoughts, he realized that he could not bear the crushing weight of so many years of past on his soul.</t6889>
<t6890>With his heart pierced by deadly spears made of his own and others' longings, he admired the resilience of the spider webs on the dried rose bushes, the persistence of the weeds, and the patience of the air filling the bright February morning.</t6890> <t6891>Then he saw the child.</t6891> <t6892>To this dried and swollen sack of skin that had long since left childhood behind, all the ants in the world clung to the stony path of the garden, each pulling towards its own nest.</t6892> <t6893>Aureliario couldn't move from his spot.</t6893>
<t6894>He was not frozen in place out of terror, but because Melquiades' final clue had just become clear to him.</t6894> <t6895>The last sentence in the manuscripts fit perfectly into the arrangement of time and space.</t6895> <t6896>-The founder of the line is tied to a tree, and the last one is eaten by ants, Melquiades had written.</t6896>
<t6897>Aureliano has never been as clear-headed in any period of his life as he was when he nailed the doors and windows shut again with Fernanda's crosswise boards, to avoid being seduced by the world's temptations and to not forget his dead and the pain of his dead.</t6897> <t6898>Because he knew that his destiny was found in Melquiades' writings.</t6898> <t6899>In Melquiades' room, among the prehistoric plants that had developed by erasing all traces indicating the existence of humans on earth, the bubbling puddles, and the shiny insects, he found the manuscripts intact and, unable to wait to bring them into the daylight, stood in the middle of the room and began to read them aloud effortlessly, as if they were written in Spanish and were being read in the dazzling midday sun.</t6899> <t6900>These writings were the family's history, written by Melquiades a century before the events, covering everything down to the smallest detail.</t6900> <t6901>Melquiades had written the texts in his native Sanskrit, coding the even-numbered verses with Emperor Augustus's secret cipher and the odd-numbered verses with the Spartan military cipher.</t6901>
<t6902>At the time when Aureliano was preoccupied with Amaranta Ursula's love, the last code he was about to decipher was the manner in which the history was written.</t6902> <t6903>Melquiades had not arranged the events in the usual chronological order; he had compiled the daily events that occurred over a century in such a way that all the events seemed to happen simultaneously.</t6903>
<t6904>It seemed like.</t6904> <t6905>Enchanted by this discovery, Aureliano read aloud the passage that Melquiades had read to Arcadio, which actually determined Arcadio's execution, without skipping a word. Then he read the news of the birth of the most beautiful woman in the world who flew to heaven, and discovered the identity of the twins who, not out of lack of talent or laziness but because their attempts were untimely, gave up deciphering the manuscripts after their father's death.</t6905> <t6906>When he reached that part of the writings, Aureliano, impatient to learn his own identity, skipped a few pages.</t6906> <t6907>Then, a warm breeze began, laden with the voices of the past, the murmur of old geraniums, and the broken sighs that led to the most relentless yearnings.</t6907> <t6908>Aureliano did not notice the wind.</t6908> <t6909>Because at that moment, he was investigating his own origins, finding the first signs of his own being in a lustful grandfather who had set out in search of a beautiful woman who would not make him happy.</t6909>
<t6910>Aureliano recognized him, understanding how he came into being among the scorpions in the bathroom at sunset where a woman who devoted herself to rebellion and a worker who quenched his passion with her met, following the secret path of his descendants with yellow butterflies.</t6910>
<t6911>He was so engrossed in what he was reading that he didn't notice the wind turning into a hurricane, tearing doors and windows off their hinges, blowing off the roof of the east wing, and shaking the foundations of the house.</t6911>
<t6912>It was only then that he understood that Sir Francis Drake had attacked Rioacha so that Aureliano and Amaranta Ursula could search for each other in the most intricate labyrinths of blood until Amaranta Ursula, who was not his sister but his aunt, brought into the world the legendary creature that would mark the end of their lineage.</t6912>
<t6913>At the moment Aureliano skipped eleven pages at once to avoid wasting time on events he knew very well, Macondo had already turned into a whirlwind of dust and stones, swept up by the wrath of the storm written in the Holy Scriptures.</t6913>
<t6914>Aureliano set out to decipher the section describing the moment he was living in.</t6914>
<t6915>On one hand, he was deciphering the code, on the other, he was living what he read, experiencing the events written on the last pages as if he were looking into a talking mirror.</t6915> <t6916>Then, he skipped a page to learn how and when his own death would occur.</t6916> <t6917>Before reaching the last line, he had realized that he would never be able to leave that room again.</t6917> <t6918>Because the manuscripts stated that at the moment Aureliano Babilonia deciphered the codes, the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be swept away by the wind and erased from people's memories, and what was written would never be repeated from the beginning to the end of the universe.</t6918> <t6919>Because the lineages condemned to a hundred years of solitude could not have a second chance on earth.</t6919>
