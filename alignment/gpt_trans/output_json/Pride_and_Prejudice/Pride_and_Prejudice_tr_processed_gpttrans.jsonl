and it was only then that I understood his attachment to Miss Bennet was beyond what I had seen before.</t3554> <t3555>I also watched your sister.</t3555> <t3556>\u2013Her demeanor was as open, cheerful, and charming as ever, but there were no signs of special interest; from my observations that evening, I concluded that while Miss Bennet accepted Bingley's interest with pleasure, she did not invite it with any shared feelings.</t3556> <t3557>\u2013If you are not mistaken on this point, then I was wrong.</t3557> <t3558>Your better knowledge of your sister strengthens the second possibility.</t3558> <t3559>\u2013If so, if I made a mistake that caused her pain, your resentment would not be unjust.</t3559> <t3560>But I will say without hesitation that the seriousness in your sister's face and demeanor was such that even the most careful observer would think she was someone who, while friendly, was not easily accessible to the heart.</t3560> <t3561>\u2013It is true that I wanted to believe in her indifference, \u2013but I can say that my investigations and decisions are generally not influenced by my hopes or fears.</t3561> <t3562>\u2013I did not believe in your sister's indifference because I wanted it to be so; \u2013I believed it with impartial conviction, and with the same sincerity.</t3562> <t3563>\u2013My objections to the marriage were not the matters I confessed last night could be overcome by a great passion on my part; the issue of relatives was not as great an obstacle for my friend as it was for me.</t3563> <t3564>\u2013But there were other annoying circumstances; \u2013although they still exist, and even if they exist to the same extent for both of us, they are not constantly in front of me, so I personally try to forget them.</t3564> <t3565>\u2013These reasons also need to be briefly mentioned.</t3565> <t3566>\u2013The situation of your mother's family, though repulsive, is insignificant compared to the absolute vulgarity almost always displayed by her, your three younger sisters, and even occasionally your father.</t3566> <t3567>\u2013Forgive me.</t3567> <t3568>\u2013It pains me to offend you.</t3568> <t3569>However, despite the discomfort you feel because of the faults of your closest relatives and the displeasure you will feel at their being described in this way, you may find consolation in knowing that the praise of your and your sister's intelligence and sensitivity, which prevents you from sharing in a similar judgment, is frequently expressed as you deserve.</t3569> <t3570>\u2013Lastly, I must say that what happened that evening confirmed my views on everyone and strengthened my desire to protect my friend from a connection I found very unpleasant without further delay.</t3570> <t3571>\u2013The next day, as you surely know, he went to London from Netherfield, intending to return soon.</t3571> <t3572>\u2013Now it's time to explain the role I played.</t3572> <t3573>\u2013His sisters' discomfort was no less than mine; we soon realized we shared the same thought; and believing that we should not waste time in separating their brother, we immediately decided to go to London to join him.</t3573> <t3574>\u2013We went \u2013there I began to explain to my friend the certain disadvantages of such a choice.</t3574> <t3575>\u2013I did not just describe them, I proved them.</t3575> <t3576>\u2013This intervention could have accelerated or delayed his decision, but in my opinion, it would not have prevented the marriage in the end if I had not mentioned your sister's indifference, which I did without hesitation.</t3576> <t3577>Until then, he believed he had received sincere reciprocation of feelings, if not to the same extent as his own.</t3577> <t3578>\u2013But Bingley has a tremendous natural humility; he trusts my judgments more than his own.</t3578> <t3579>\u2013It was not difficult to convince him that he was deceiving himself.</t3579> <t3580>After giving him this belief, persuading him not to return to Hertfordshire was a moment's work.</t3580> <t3581>\u2013I cannot blame myself for what I did.</t3581> <t3582>There is one aspect of my behavior in the whole matter that I do not like to remember; that is, I stooped so low as to scheme to keep from him the fact that your sister was in town.</t3582> <t3583>I knew, Miss Bingley knew, but her brother still does not know.</t3583> <t3584>\u2013It is possible that they could have met without bad consequences; \u2013but it seemed to me that his feelings had not yet faded enough for him to see her safely.</t3584> <t3585>\u2013Perhaps these secretive, devious actions did not suit me.</t3585> <t3586>\u2013But I did it once, and I did it with good intentions.</t3586> <t3587>\u2013I have nothing more to say on this matter, no other excuse to offer.</t3587> <t3588>If I hurt your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly; the reasons that guided me may naturally seem insufficient to you, but I have not yet learned to reject them.</t3588> <t3589>\u2013As for the more serious accusation, the accusation that I harmed Mr. Wickham, I can refute it by revealing his entire connection with my family.</t3589> <t3590>I do not know exactly what he accuses me of; but I can present more than one witness whose reliability is beyond doubt regarding the truth of what I will tell.</t3590> <t3591>Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man who managed all the Pemberley estates; his father's good conduct in his duties naturally inspired my father with a desire to be beneficial to him, and he showed his affection for his godson George Wickham with all his generosity.</t3591> <t3592>My father supported him at school, and later at Cambridge \u2013significantly, because his own father, condemned to poverty by his wife's extravagance, was not in a position to provide him with a gentleman's education.</t3592> <t3593>My father not only valued the friendship of this young man, who always had pleasant manners, but also held high hopes for him and decided to provide him with a means of livelihood by hoping he would choose the church as his profession.</t3593> <t3594>For my part, I began to think differently about him years, long years ago.</t3594> <t3595>He was careful to hide his immoral tendencies and indecency from his closest friend, but these did not escape the notice of a young man almost the same age as him, who had the opportunity to catch him in unguarded moments, unlike Mr. Darcy.</t3595> <t3596>Here I will upset you again \u2013only you can know how much.</t3596> <t3597>But whatever feelings Mr. Wickham has aroused, my doubts about their nature will not prevent me from revealing his true face.</t3597> <t3598>There is another reason.</t3598> <t3599>My kind-hearted father died five years ago; his attachment to Mr. Wickham continued until the end; so much so that in his will, he specifically instructed me to assist him in advancing in his profession as much as possible, and if he qualified for the clergy, to give him a valuable family living as soon as it became vacant.</t3599> <t3600>There was also a sum of one thousand pounds.</t3600> <t3601>His father did not outlive mine by much; six months after these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to me saying he had decided to give up his religious education, and hoped I would not find it inappropriate to expect some financial assistance instead of a church appointment that would be of no use to him.</t3601> <t3602>He also added that he intended to study law; he assumed I would understand that the interest on a thousand pounds would not be enough to support him there.</t3602> <t3603>Although I did not believe he was sincere, I wished he were; but in any case, I was ready to accept his proposal.</t3603> <t3604>I knew Mr. Wickham should not be a clergyman.</t3604> <t3605>The matter was quickly settled.</t3605> <t3606>He renounced all financial rights he could have received from the church and accepted three thousand pounds in return.</t3606> <t3607>Thus, all relations between us seemed to be over.</t3607> <t3608>My thoughts about him were so negative that I neither invited him to Pemberley nor allowed him to appear to me in town.</t3608> <t3609>I believe he mostly lived in town, but the study of law was merely a lie; once free of all obstacles, his life became one of complete idleness and vagabondage.</t3609> <t3610>For three years, I heard little from him; but upon the death of the clergyman intended for him, he again approached me for the letter of appointment.</t3610> <t3611>He wanted me to believe he was in very bad condition, which I found easy to believe.</t3611> <t3612>He had seen that law was a non-lucrative profession and had now definitely decided to take the clergy, provided I gave him the said living \u2013he had no doubt about it, and besides, who else did I have to look after, and I could not have forgotten my dear father's intention.</t3612> <t3613>You cannot blame me for refusing this attempt or resisting its repetition.</t3613> <t3614>His resentment was proportional to the harshness of his circumstances \u2013his complaints to others were as intense as the insults he directed at me.</t3614> <t3615>After this period, all signs of acquaintance were abandoned.</t3615> <t3616>I do not know how he lived.</t3616> <t3617>But last summer, he entered my life again in a very painful way.</t3617> <t3618>I must now speak of an event I wish I could forget and which no force other than the current matter would compel me to reveal to anyone.</t3618> <t3619>I am telling you this because I have no doubt you know how to keep a secret.</t3619> <t3620>My sister, who is at least ten years younger than me, was left under the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.</t3620> <t3621>About a year ago, she was taken from school and a house was opened for her in London; last summer, she went to Ramsgate with the lady managing the house; Mr. Wickham also went there, undoubtedly with intent; for it turned out he had a prior acquaintance with Mrs. Younge, which we had been quite mistaken about her character; with her arrangement and assistance, he managed to ingratiate himself with Georgiana; my sister, whose sensitive heart had been filled with affectionate memories of him since childhood, was convinced she was in love with him and agreed to elope with him.</t3621> <t3622>She was only fifteen at the time; this must be her excuse; after expressing her imprudence, I am also pleased to add that I learned of the matter from her.</t3622> <t3623>A few days before the planned elopement, I unexpectedly joined them; at that time, Georgiana could no longer bear the idea of subjecting a brother she saw as a father to such distress and insult, and she told me everything as it was.</t3623> <t3624>You can imagine what I felt and how I acted.</t3624> <t3625>My concern for my sister's reputation and feelings prevented the matter from becoming public; but my writing to Mr. Wickham and his immediate departure were simultaneous; Mrs. Younge was, of course, dismissed from her position.</t3625> <t3626>Mr. Wickham's main goal was undoubtedly my sister's thirty thousand-pound fortune; on the other hand, I cannot help but think that the hope of taking revenge on me was also a strong motivating factor.</t3626> <t3627>This, madam, is an honest explanation of every event between us; if you do not reject it as a lie, I hope you will retract the accusation that I have been cruel to Mr. Wickham.</t3627> <t3628>I do not know what style or lies he used to influence you; but perhaps his success should not be surprising, as you had no prior knowledge of these matters.</t3628> <t3629>You could not have learned these things yourself; doubting them was naturally not in your nature.</t3629> <t3630>You may wonder why all this was not told to you last night.</t3630> <t3631>But at that time, I was not in a state to decide how much could be explained.</t3631> <t3632>Regarding the truth of everything told here, I can particularly recommend the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam; due to our close relationship and constant confidences, and as one of the executors of my father's will, he has inevitably been involved in every detail of these transactions.</t3632> <t3633>If your contempt for me makes my explanations worthless, there is no reason to prevent you from consulting my cousin; I will try to find an opportunity to give you this letter this morning so that you can consult him.</t3633> <t3634>All I can wish is, may God protect you.</t3634></passage>", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 4430, "completion_tokens": 3521, "total_tokens": 7951}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3aa7262c27"}}, "error": null}

since I anticipate that a short writing will not suffice to explain everything I need to tell you, I will dedicate the entire morning to replying.</t5604>\n<t5605>I must confess that I am surprised by your request; I did not expect this from you.</t5605>\n<t5606>Do not think that I am angry, but I want you to know that I did not think you would need to ask such questions.</t5606>\n<t5607>If you are having difficulty understanding me, please excuse my intervention.</t5607>\n<t5608>Your uncle was as surprised as I was \u2013 he would never have acted this way if he believed you were aware of the matter.</t5608>\n<t5609>But if you are truly unaware, then I must be more explicit.</t5609>\n<t5610>The day I returned home from Longbourn, your uncle received an unexpected visitor.</t5610>\n<t5611>Mr. Darcy came, and they locked themselves in a room for several hours.</t5611>\n<t5612>Everything was over before I arrived; therefore, my curiosity was not as agonizing as yours.</t5612>\n<t5613>Mr. Darcy came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, had seen them, had spoken with Wickham frequently, and with Lydia once.</t5613>\n<t5614>As far as I can understand, he left Derbyshire a day after us and came to the city with the aim of finding them.</t5614>\n<t5615>The reason for his action was that he felt responsible for the fact that Wickham's villainy was not sufficiently known; if it were known, it would be impossible for well-bred girls to love or trust him.</t5615>\n<t5616>He found all the blame in his own faulty pride; he admitted that he did not consider it appropriate to reveal private matters to the public.</t5616>\n<t5617>Therefore, he felt it his duty to come forward and make an effort to remedy a wrong he had caused.</t5617>\n<t5618>If there is another reason, I am sure it is not one that would embarrass him.</t5618>\n<t5619>He spent a few days in the city until he found them; unlike us, he knew where to direct his search; knowing this was another reason he decided to follow us.</t5619>\n<t5620>It appears there is a lady, someone named Mrs. Younge, who was Miss Darcy's governess for a while; he did not say exactly what happened, but she was dismissed for some reason.</t5620>\n<t5621>The lady then rented a large house on Edward Street and has been making a living by renting rooms since then.</t5621>\n<t5622>He knew that Mrs. Younge was well acquainted with Wickham and went to her for information as soon as he arrived in the city.</t5622>\n<t5623>But it took two or three days to get what he wanted from her.</t5623>\n<t5624>Apparently, he had to bribe her to betray Wickham because she really knew where her friend was.</t5624>\n<t5625>Wickham had actually gone to her first when he came to London; if she could have accommodated him, they would have stayed with her.</t5625>\n<t5626>But in the end, our kind-hearted friend got the address he wanted.</t5626>\n<t5627>They were on ------- street.</t5627>\n<t5628>He saw Wickham and then insisted on seeing Lydia.</t5628>\n<t5629>His initial aim regarding Lydia was to persuade her to end that disgraceful situation and return to her relatives, as soon as they were willing to accept her, and he offered to help as much as he could to achieve this.</t5629>\n<t5630>But he saw that Lydia was determined to stay where she was.</t5630>\n<t5631>She did not care about her relatives, did not want his help, and would not even hear of leaving Wickham.</t5631>\n<t5632>At some point, she was sure they would marry, and the timing did not matter much.</t5632>\n<t5633>Given her feelings, he thought the only thing left was to secure and hasten the marriage; in his first conversation with Wickham, he easily learned that he had no such intention.</t5633>\n<t5634>Wickham himself admitted that he had to leave the regiment due to some urgent gambling debts; he did not hesitate to attribute all the bad consequences of Lydia's elopement solely to her foolishness.</t5634>\n<t5635>He intended to leave the regiment immediately; he had no clear idea of what he would do in the future.</t5635>\n<t5636>He had to go somewhere, but he did not know where; he also did not know how he would make a living.</t5636>\n<t5637>Mr. Darcy asked him why he did not marry your sister immediately.</t5637>\n<t5638>Although Mr. Bennet was not very wealthy, he could do something for him, and his situation could improve through marriage.</t5638>\n<t5639>But in response to this question, Mr. Darcy learned that Wickham still held out hope of making a more substantial fortune through marriage in another region.</t5639>\n<t5640>However, it was not easy for him to resist the temptation of immediate relief.</t5640>\n<t5641>They met several times because there was much to discuss.</t5641>\n<t5642>Of course, Wickham wanted more than he could get, but eventually, he agreed to a reasonable amount.</t5642>\n<t5643>Once everything was settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to inform your uncle of the situation; he visited Gracechurch Street the evening before my first arrival.</t5643>\n<t5644>But Mr. Gardiner was not around; after doing some more research, Mr. Darcy learned that your father was with him but would leave the city the next day.</t5644>\n<t5645>Thinking he could not speak as comfortably with your father as with your uncle, he postponed the meeting until your father left.</t5645>\n<t5646>He did not leave his name; until the next day, all that was known was that a gentleman had called on business.</t5646>\n<t5647>He came again on Saturday.</t5647>\n<t5648>Your father was gone, your uncle was home, and as I said, they talked extensively in private.</t5648>\n<t5649>They met again on Sunday, and that was when I saw him.</t5649>\n<t5650>Everything was settled by Monday: a courier was immediately sent to Longbourn.</t5650>\n<t5651>But our guest was very stubborn.</t5651>\n<t5652>It seems to me, my dear Lizzy, that stubbornness is his true character flaw.</t5652>\n<t5653>He has been found to have many faults at different times; but this is the real flaw.</t5653>\n<t5654>He did not allow anything to be done that he did not do himself; yet I am sure (I am not saying this to expect thanks, so do not say anything) your uncle would have wholeheartedly handled the entire matter.</t5654>\n<t5655>They struggled over this for a long time, much more than the gentleman or lady involved deserved.</t5655>\n<t5656>But in the end, your uncle had to agree; he had to be content with the probable reputation of being truly helpful to his niece rather than actually being so, which he could not bear at all; therefore, I believe your letter this morning pleased him greatly because it asked for an explanation that would free your uncle from his borrowed crown and return the praise to where it belonged.</t5656>\n<t5657>However, my dear Lizzy, no one should know about this except you and perhaps Jane.</t5657>\n<t5658>I believe you know very well what was done for the young couple.</t5658>\n<t5659>Wickham's debts, which I believe exceed a thousand pounds, will be paid, and another thousand will be added to Lydia's own money in her name, and Wickham's rank in the army will be purchased.</t5659>\n<t5660>All this was done solely by him for the reason I mentioned above.</t5660>\n<t5661>It was Mr. Darcy's fault, negligence, and thoughtlessness that Wickham's character was so misunderstood and consequently accepted by society.</t5661>\n<t5662>There may be some truth in this; but I doubt that the reason was his or anyone else's negligence.</t5662>\n<t5663>Nevertheless, despite all these fine words, my dear Lizzy, rest assured, your uncle would not have agreed if he did not think there was another reason related to this matter.</t5663>\n<t5664>When all this was decided, Mr. Darcy returned to his friends still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he would come to London once more for the wedding; all financial matters would be finalized then.</t5664>\n<t5665>I believe I have now told you everything.</t5665>\n<t5666>You said this explanation would surprise you greatly; I hope at least it will not upset you.</t5666>\n<t5667>Lydia came to us; Wickham was allowed to come and go as he pleased.</t5667>\n<t5668>Wickham was just as he was when we knew him in Hertfordshire; I was not going to tell you how repulsive I found Lydia's behavior while she stayed with us, but from Jane's letter last Wednesday, I understand that her behavior when she arrived home was the same; so what I will now tell you will not cause you new pain.</t5668>\n<t5669>I spoke to Lydia very seriously and repeatedly, explaining the immorality of what she had done and how much she had made her family unhappy.</t5669>\n<t5670>If she heard me, it was by chance, because I am sure she did not listen.</t5670>\n<t5671>Sometimes I felt like I was losing control, but then I remembered my dear Elizabeth and Jane and showed patience for their sake.</t5671>\n<t5672>Mr. Darcy returned without delay and, as Lydia told you, attended the wedding.</t5672>\n<t5673>He had dinner with us the next day; he was to leave the city again on Wednesday or Thursday.</t5673>\n<t5674>If I take this opportunity to tell you how much I admire him (I had not found the courage to say this before), will you be angry with me, my dear Lizzy?</t5674>\n<t5675>His behavior towards us was as pleasant in every way as it was in Derbyshire.</t5675>\n<t5676>I like his intelligence and opinions; all he needs is a bit more liveliness, which, if he makes a wise marriage, his wife can teach him.</t5676>\n<t5677>I found him very tight-lipped; \u2013 he hardly mentioned your name.</t5677>\n<t5678>But being tight-lipped must be in fashion these days.</t5678>\n<t5679>If I have been building castles in the air, please forgive me, or at least do not punish me so severely as to ban me from Pemberley.</t5679>\n<t5680>I will never be happy until I thoroughly explore the grove.</t5680>\n<t5681>A small carriage with a pair of beautiful ponies will suffice and more.</t5681>\n<t5682>But I cannot continue any longer.</t5682>\n<t5683>The children have been calling me for half an hour.</t5683>\n<t5684>With my love,</t5684>\n</passage>", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 3224, "completion_tokens": 2570, "total_tokens": 5794}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3aa7262c27"}}, "error": null}
