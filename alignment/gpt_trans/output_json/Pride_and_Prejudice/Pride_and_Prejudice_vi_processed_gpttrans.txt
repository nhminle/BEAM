<t0>Chapter 1</t0>
<t1>There is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</t1> <t2>Even though very little is known about the feelings or views of such a man when he first moves into a neighborhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered the rightful property of one or another of their daughters.</t2>
<t3>One day, Mrs. Bennet said to her husband:</t3>
<t4>- My dear, do you know that someone has rented Netherfield Park?</t4>
<t5>Mr. Bennet replied that he did not know yet.</t5>
<t6>The wife continued:</t6>
<t7>- Someone has already rented it.</t7> <t8>Mrs. Long went there and told me all about it.</t8>
<t9>Mr. Bennet listened and did not reply.</t9> <t10>His wife, losing all patience, said: "Do you want to know who has just moved in?"</t10>
<t11>- It is you who wants to tell me the story.</t11>
<t12>That was enough encouragement for her to continue speaking.</t12>
<t13>- You must know, Mrs. Long has informed me that there is a young, wealthy gentleman from the North who has rented Netherfield. He arrived on Monday in a four-horse carriage.</t13> <t14>He likes the place very much and agreed immediately to Mr. Morris's price.</t14> <t15>And he is supposed to arrive before St. Michael's Day, but some of his servants will come ahead next week.</t15>
<t16>- So what is his name?</t16>
<t17>- Bingley.</t17>
<t18>- Is he married or still single?</t18>
<t19>- Ah, he must still be single.</t19> <t20>A single man with a large income, four or five thousand pounds a year.</t20> <t21>That would be a good thing for our daughters!</t21>
<t22>- So what?</t22> <t23>What does that have to do with our daughters?</t23>
<t24>- Dear, you must understand that I am thinking about him marrying one of our children.</t24>
<t25>- So, did that guy have such an intention when he came here</t25><t26>?</t26>
<t27>- Intention? How can you speak so recklessly? It's just that he might fall in love with one of our daughters, so you must visit him as soon as possible.</t27>
<t28>- I don't see any opportunity at all.</t28> <t29>You and the kids can go, or let the kids go by themselves, that might be better.</t29> <t30>Because you are more beautiful than them, I'm afraid Mr. Bingley might like you more.</t30>
<t31>- Oh sir, you are flattering me again.</t31> <t32>Surely, I once had my youthful days, but now I cannot consider myself special.</t32> <t33>When a woman has five grown daughters, she should no longer think about her own beauty.</t33>
<t34>- Well, only when that woman doesn't have any beauty worth thinking about.</t34>
<t35>- But hey, you should go meet Mr. Bingley as soon as he arrives here.</t35>
<t36>- To be honest, it's beyond my ability.</t36> <t37>You know...</t37>
<t38>- But you have to think about the children.</t38> <t39>Just think that one of them might achieve something. Sir William and Lady Lucas are also determined to go for that very reason.</t39> <t40>You know they usually don't like visiting new people.</t40> <t41>In fact, you must go, otherwise, the children and I have no reason to go if you don't.</t41>
<t42>- You are being overly cautious.</t42> <t43>I am sure that Mr. Bingley will be pleased to meet you, and I will send you with a few lines to let him know that I am willing to accept, if he chooses one of my daughters, although I will say little to praise Lizzy.</t43>
<t44>- I hope you won't do that.</t44> <t45>Lizzy is no better than the others, and I don't think she's half as beautiful as Jane, nor half as lively as Lydia, yet you always favor her the most!</t45>
<t46>- So, do you think those kids have anything worth mentioning?</t46>
<t47>- Mr. Bennet, how can you humiliate our children like that?</t47> <t48>You just tease me to get me upset for fun.</t48> <t49>You have no sympathy for my sensitive nerves at all!</t49>
<t50>- You are mistaken.</t50> <t51>I have great respect for your nerves.</t51> <t52>At least for the past twenty years, I have heard you talk a lot about your nerves.</t52>
<t53>- Hmph! You can't possibly know how much I've suffered...</t53>
<t54>- But I hope you will soon get over it, and continue to live to see many young men with four thousand pounds a year come to reside in this area.</t54>
<t55>- If twenty people like that come here but you refuse to meet them, it will be pointless.</t55>
<t56>- When there are twenty people, I will go meet everyone.</t56>
<t57>Mr. Bennet's personality was a blend of cunning, sarcastic humor, reserve, and unpredictability, so much so that even after decades of living together, his wife still couldn't understand him.</t57> <t58>Her mind was simpler.</t58> <t59>She had a narrow-minded empathy, poor knowledge, and an erratic temperament.</t59> <t60>When things didn't go her way, she felt as if she were anxious.</t60> <t61>Her whole life revolved around finding husbands for her five daughters.</t61> <t62>Visiting and exchanging gossip were her ways of relieving boredom.</t62>

<t66>Chapter 2</t66>
<t67>Mr. Bennet was one of the earliest visitors to call on Bingley.</t67> <t68>He always intended to visit him, although he constantly told his wife that he did not want to go.</t68> <t69>It was not until the evening after the visit that his wife learned of it.</t69> <t70>While watching his second daughter trim a hat, he suddenly said to her: - Lizzy, I hope Mr. Bingley will like this hat.</t70>
<t71>She was offended:</t71>
<t72>- We cannot know what he likes because we do not visit him.</t72>
<t73>Elizabeth said:</t73>
<t74>- Have you forgotten?</t74> <t75>We will meet him at the gathering, and Mrs. Long has promised to introduce us to him.</t75>
<t76>- Mom doesn't believe Mrs. Long would do such a thing.</t76> <t77>She still has two granddaughters.</t77> <t78>She is a selfish, hypocritical, and untrustworthy person.</t78>
<t79>Mr. Bennet interjected</t79>
<t80>- I don't believe it either, so I'm glad you have no intention of asking her for help.</t80>
<t81>Mrs. Bennet did not bother to reply, but unable to contain herself, she turned to scold her daughters.</t81>
<t82>- Kitty, don't keep coughing like that.</t82> <t83>You have to consider your mother's nerves a bit.</t83> <t84>My head is about to explode here.</t84>
<t85>The father interjected:</t85>
<t86>- Kitty coughs without any discretion, coughing at inappropriate times.</t86>
<t87>Kitty replied miserably: - I'm not happy enough to laugh like that.</t87>
<t88>- When is your prom?</t88>
<t89>- Two more weeks.</t89>
<t90>The mother exclaimed in shock:</t90>
<t91>- Ah, I see.</t91> <t92>Mrs. Long will only return the day before that, so she can't introduce him because she doesn't know him yet.</t92>
<t93>- So you have an advantage over your friend, just introduce Mr. Bingley to the girl.</t93>
<t94>- It's not possible, sir, it's not possible, as I still haven't gotten to know him.</t94> <t95>How can you joke like that?</t95>
<t96>- I commend you for being cautious.</t96> <t97>Two weeks is too little time to get acquainted.</t97> <t98>We cannot know what someone we just met thinks after only two weeks, but if we are not bold, others will take the initiative.</t98> <t99>Anyway, Mrs. Long and her two nieces also want to try their luck.</t99> <t100>If we do not move forward, she will think we are yielding, and she will seize the opportunity.</t100>
<t101>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet only said: - Nonsense, absolute nonsense!</t101>
<t102>- What do you mean by that?</t102> <t103>Do you mean that the way of introduction and the tension in this matter are unreasonable?</t103> <t104>I cannot agree with you on this point.</t104> <t105>Mary, do you have any opinions?</t105> <t106>Dad knows you like to think carefully, enjoy reading good books, and often quote from them.</t106>
<t107>Mary wanted to say something reasonable, but couldn't think of anything.</t107>
<t108>He continued:</t108>
<t109>- While Mary is gathering her thoughts, let's return to the story of Mr. Bingley.</t109>
<t110>The wife raised her voice:</t110>
<t111>- I'm too tired of this Bingley guy.</t111>
<t112>- I am sorry to hear you say that, but why didn't you say it earlier?</t112> <t113>If I had known this morning, I certainly wouldn't have gone to meet him.</t113> <t114>It's really unfortunate, but since I have met him, we can't avoid this acquaintance now.</t114>
<t115>The astonishment of the girls was exactly what he desired; Mrs. Bennet herself was even more astonished than her daughters, yet after moments of agitation came joy; she believed that this was what she had always wished for.</t115>
<t116>- My dear Mr. Bennet, how kind you are!</t116> <t117>But I know in the end I still have to persuade you.</t117> <t118>I know very well that you love the children very much, so you cannot overlook such an acquaintance.</t118> <t119>I'm so happy!</t119> <t120>It's quite amusing how you joked this morning, going without saying a word until now.</t120>
<t121>Mr. Bennet turned to Kitty and said, "Kitty, you may cough as much as you like now."</t121>
<t122>He spoke as he walked out of the room, feeling tired from his wife's enthusiastic words.</t122>
<t123>When the door of the room had closed, she told her children: "See, you have a wonderful father."</t123> <t124>"I don't understand how you will repay your father's care, even I don't know."</t124> <t125>"I don't mind telling you, at our age, making new acquaintances every day is not very pleasant, but we are willing to do everything for you."</t125> <t126>"Lydia, although you are the youngest, I am sure Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the upcoming ball."</t126>
<t127>Lydia said firmly:</t127>
<t128>- I'm not afraid.</t128> <t129>Although I'm the youngest, I'm taller than my sisters.</t129>
<t130>And for the rest of the evening, they took turns guessing when Mr. Bingley would visit Mr. Bennet to return the courtesy, and discussed when they could invite him to dinner.</t130>
<t131>Chapter 3</t131>
<t132>However, through her husband, Mrs. Bennet could not learn much about Mr. Bingley, even with the assistance of their five daughters.</t132> <t133>They questioned him in every possible way, with every question, every marvelous conjecture, every vague assumption, but he evaded them all.</t133> <t134>In the end, they had to accept indirect information from their neighbor, Mrs. Lucas.</t134> <t135>The news she provided was very favorable.</t135> <t136>Sir William had a particular fondness for Mr. Bingley. He was a fairly young man, very handsome and extremely amiable, and most importantly, he intended to bring many people to the ball.</t136> <t137>Nothing could be more perfect.</t137> <t138>A fondness for dancing is the first step towards a romance, so everyone freely hoped for his heart.</t138>
<t139>Mrs. Bennet said to her husband:</t139>
<t140>- If I could just see one daughter having a happy life at Netherfield, and the other four having similar good fortunes, I would have no more wishes.</t140>
<t141>A few days later, Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and during the ten minutes he spent with him in the study, he hoped to be allowed to meet the girls, whom he had heard others praise for their beauty, but he only met the father.</t141> <t142>The girls were luckier, as they could observe him from the upstairs window, seeing him wearing a blue coat and riding a black horse.</t142>
<t143>Then came the invitation to dinner, and Mrs. Bennet hurriedly arranged many things before receiving a response.</t143> <t144>Mr. Bingley had business in London the next day and could not accept the invitation.</t144> <t145>Mrs. Bennet was disappointed.</t145> <t146>She could not imagine what important business he had in the city right after arriving in Hertfordshire.</t146> <t147>She began to worry that he might flit from place to place without settling down at Netherfield. Lady Lucas had to reassure her, suggesting that Bingley was only going to London to invite friends to the ball.</t147> <t148>Soon, there was news that Mr. Bingley would bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen to the ball.</t148> <t149>The girls were distressed to hear of such a large number of women, but on the morning before the ball, they heard that instead of twelve, he would bring only six people from London, five sisters and a cousin.</t149> <t150>When the ball began, there were only five people: Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the elder sister, and another young man.</t150>
<t151>Mr. Bingley had a handsome appearance and a graceful demeanor.</t151> <t152>His face was pleasant, his gestures leisurely and sincere.</t152> <t153>His two sisters looked mature, with a style of decisive conduct.</t153> <t154>His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, only appeared courteous.</t154> <t155>But his friend, named Darcy, soon attracted the attention of the entire room, due to his tall, handsome, and elegant figure; and within five minutes of his entrance, there was a murmur that his annual income amounted to ten thousand a year.</t155> <t156>The gentlemen considered him well-proportioned, while the ladies thought he was even more handsome than Bingley.</t156> <t157>For half the evening, everyone had a favorable opinion of him.</t157> <t158>Afterwards, his own behavior caused many to despise him.</t158> <t159>They thought he was proud, that he placed himself above his friends, and did not mingle and enjoy himself with everyone.</t159> <t160>Even with his large estate in Derbyshire, his face bore an unpleasant, disagreeable expression, unworthy of comparison to his friend.</t160>
<t161>It wasn't long before Bingley had acquainted himself with everyone important in the room.</t161> <t162>He appeared lively and unpretentious, danced to every piece of music, expressed dissatisfaction when the ball ended too early, and announced that he would host another ball at Netherfield. Between him and his friend, they were indeed two extremes! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, did not wish to be introduced to other women, and then just walked around, occasionally talking to a few people in the group.</t162> <t163>Everyone quickly recognized his character.</t163> <t164>In this world, he might be the most disagreeable person, the most disagreeable, and everyone hoped he would not return.</t164> <t165>Mrs. Bennet, in particular, had the strongest aversion; she felt annoyed because he had slighted one of her daughters.</t165>
<t166>Because there were more women than men, Elizabeth Bennet had to sit out for two dances, and during that time Darcy talked to Bingley while standing quite close to her, so she overheard.</t166>
<t167>Mr. Bingley wanted to persuade his friend to dance more.</t167>
<t168>- Hey Darcy, you must dance.</t168> <t169>I don't like seeing you stand here with such a dull demeanor.</t169> <t170>Dancing is fun with others.</t170>
<t171>- I don't like it.</t171> <t172>You know I hate dancing, except with someone I know well.</t172> <t173>I can't stand these people.</t173> <t174>Your sisters have partners, and I find dancing with the other women in the room to be torture.</t174>
<t175>- Tờ is not as picky as you.</t175> <t176>To be honest, in my life, I have never met such lovely people, with a few being absolutely beautiful.</t176>
<t177>Darcy looked at the eldest daughter of the Bennet family:</t177>
<t178>- You only dance with the beautiful girls in this room.</t178>
<t179>- She is the most beautiful person I have ever met!</t179> <t180>But the very pretty, very cute girl sitting behind you is also lovely.</t180> <t181>Allow me to ask my dance partner to introduce her to you.</t181>
<t182>Darcy turned to look at Elizabeth for a moment, caught her gaze, then turned away and coldly said:</t182>
<t183>- What do you mean?</t183> <t184>She looks okay, but not attractive enough to captivate me, and I don't like chasing after women who have been discarded by other men.</t184> <t185>You should go out with your dance partner, don't waste your time with me.</t185>
<t186>Bingley followed his friend's advice.</t186> <t187>Darcy walked away; and Elizabeth sat still, without any friendly feelings towards him.</t187> <t188>But afterwards she cheerfully recounted the story to her friend, as she had a playful nature and took delight in all oddities.</t188>
<t189>The Bennet family was pleased with the ball.</t189> <t190>Mrs. Bennet noticed that everyone in attendance liked her eldest daughter.</t190> <t191>Bingley had danced with her twice, and she stood out among her sisters.</t191> <t192>As a result, Jane felt as pleased as her mother, though in a quieter manner.</t192> <t193>Elizabeth sensed Jane's joy.</t193> <t194>Mary heard someone tell Mr. Bingley that Jane was the most perfect girl in the area.</t194> <t195>As for Catherine and Lydia, they were fortunate to always have someone to dance with, and that was all they hoped for at a ball.</t195> <t196>The whole family cheerfully returned to Longbourn, the village where they lived, where they were important residents.</t196> <t197>When they got home, they found Mr. Bennet still awake.</t197> <t198>All he needed was a book to lose track of time, and on this occasion, he was eager to hear about the evening that had created so much delightful anticipation for everyone.</t198> <t199>He had thought that all his wife's opinions about the stranger would be disappointed, but he heard a completely different story.</t199>
<t200>When entering the room, the wife said:</t200>
<t201>- Sir, my children and I had a really fun evening, a wonderful ball.</t201> <t202>I wish you could have come along, everyone adored Jane, it couldn't have been better.</t202> <t203>Everyone praised her for being pretty, and Mr. Bingley found her quite beautiful, dancing with her twice.</t203> <t204>I can only think about that: he danced with her twice, she was the only one invited to dance a second time.</t204> <t205>First, he invited Miss Lucas.</t205> <t206>I felt really annoyed then, but he didn't seem to like her at all.</t206> <t207>You know, actually, no one likes her.</t207> <t208>He was attracted to our Jane after dancing with her.</t208> <t209>So he inquired about her, got introduced to her, and then invited her to dance a second time.</t209> <t210>Then the third dance with Miss King, the fourth with Maria Lucas, the fifth with Jane again, the sixth with Lizzy, and then the Boulanger.</t210>
<t211>The husband impatiently interrupted:</t211>
<t212>- If he had any pity for me, he should have danced only half as much! Oh Lord, please don't talk about those girls dancing with him anymore.</t212> <t213>Ah! Perhaps it's better to say that he sprained his ankle in the first round.</t213>
<t214>Mrs. Bennet continued:</t214>
<t215>- I really like him.</t215> <t216>He is so handsome!</t216> <t217>His sisters are also attractive.</t217> <t218>In my life, I have never seen outfits as elegant as the ones they wear.</t218> <t219>I am sure the lace on Mrs. Hurst's dress...</t219>
<t220>She was interrupted again.</t220> <t221>Mr. Bennet did not want to hear her talk about flashy fashion.</t221> <t222>So she had to change the subject, and with all bitterness, adding a bit of exaggeration, she told him about Mr. Darcy's rude attitude. She continued:</t222>
<t223>- But rest assured, Lizzy doesn't lose anything by not fitting his tastes.</t223> <t224>He belongs to the most unlikable type of people, a disgusting person, not worth anyone's affection.</t224> <t225>He is so arrogant and haughty that no one can stand him.</t225> <t226>He just goes around strutting, acting like he's the best!</t226> <t227>And he's not even handsome! I wish you had been there to give him a piece of your mind! I hate him to the core.</t227>
<t228>Chapter 4</t228>
<t229>When there was no one else around, Jane confided in Elizabeth about the feelings she had for Mr. Bingley, whereas before she had been somewhat cautious in her praise:</t229>
<t230>- Young people should indeed be like him, mature, cheerful, and lively.</t230> <t231>She had never met anyone like that! So relaxed, with a wonderful cultured demeanor!</t231>
<t232>Elizabeth replied:</t232>
<t233>- He is also a handsome man, that's how a young man should be.</t233> <t234>Truly an ideal person.</t234>
<t235>- She felt proud when he invited her to dance for the second time.</t235> <t236>She didn't expect that he would pay attention to her like that.</t236>
<t237>- Unexpected, huh! I actually think you deserve it.</t237> <t238>But that's the big difference between the two of us.</t238> <t239>You always feel surprised when you get attention, while I never do.</t239> <t240>It's only natural that he invited you to dance again.</t240> <t241>He must have noticed that you're more beautiful than the other girls in the room.</t241> <t242>There's no need to thank him for that.</t242> <t243>He's really a nice guy, and I have no intention of stopping you from liking him.</t243> <t244>You've liked much more foolish people before.</t244>
<t245>- Hey Lizzy!</t245>
<t246>- Do you know?</t246> <t247>You are very easily swayed by others.</t247> <t248>In your eyes, everyone is good and likable.</t248> <t249>I've never heard you criticize anyone in my life.</t249>
<t250>- I don't want to hastily criticize others, but I always speak my mind truthfully.</t250>
<t251>- I know that.</t251> <t252>That's why you are a wonderful person.</t252> <t253>With your sincere heart, you cannot recognize the madness and recklessness of people.</t253> <t254>The attitude of pretending to be straightforward is everywhere.</t254> <t255>But being straightforward without any intention of showing off or pretense like you is truly rare.</t255> <t256>You only pay attention to people's good points to praise them and ignore the bad ones.</t256> <t257>And so, you also really like his two sisters, don't you?</t257> <t258>Their character is not as good as his.</t258>
<t259>- Certainly not as good, at first she thought so.</t259> <t260>But after talking to them, she found them very likable.</t260> <t261>His sister will live with him and help manage the house.</t261> <t262>She was not wrong when she said that we would have a truly charming neighbor like her.</t262>
<t263>Elizabeth listened in silence, but she did not feel convinced.</t263> <t264>She found the behavior of Mr. Bingley's sisters to be far from amiable.</t264> <t265>With her keen observational skills, thoughts that were not easily swayed like her sister's, and an unshakable judgment, she found it difficult to accept them.</t265> <t266>In fact, these two women were quite good people; they were not lacking in wit when they were in good spirits and were quite capable of pleasing others when they wished to.</t266> <t267>But they were too proud and self-important.</t267> <t268>They were quite beautiful, educated in a city convent school, possessed a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, had extravagant spending habits, and enjoyed mingling with the upper class.</t268> <t269>Therefore, in every respect, they felt entitled to think highly of themselves and look down on others.</t269> <t270>They belonged to a reputable family in the North of England. This was an environment that left a deeper impression on their memories than their fortune and their brother's wealth, which had been accumulated through business.</t270>
<t271>Mr. Bingley inherited from his father a fortune amounting to nearly one hundred thousand pounds.</t271> <t272>He had intended to purchase an estate, but he passed away before he could buy one.</t272> <t273>Mr. Bingley had a similar intention, and at one point had chosen a location, but now he has been provided with a spacious house along with an estate.</t273> <t274>Many people who are familiar with his character still cannot predict whether he will stay at Netherfield for life or not.</t274>
<t275>The sisters of the young man were eager for him to buy property of his own, but now, even though she was just a tenant, the younger sister did not hesitate to sit in the head chair at the dining table.</t275> <t276>Mrs. Hurst was the same, having married with more clothes than assets, whenever she wanted, she was always ready to consider her brother's house as her own place.</t276> <t277>Bingley happened to be introduced to the Netherfield house.</t277> <t278>He went to see it and after half an hour of inspecting inside and out, feeling pleased with the location of the house and its main rooms, agreed with the owner's praises, and consented immediately.</t278>
<t279>Between him and Mr. Darcy, there is a very strong friendship, despite their opposing natures.</t279> <t280>Bingley is cherished by Darcy for his easy-going, open, and pliable nature, although there is no other circumstance that brings about a greater contrast than their inherent characters, but he never shows any dissatisfaction with himself.</t280> <t281>Bingley has a firm belief in Darcy's integrity and highly values his friend's judgment.</t281> <t282>In terms of knowledge, Darcy is somewhat superior to Bingley and appears to be wiser.</t282> <t283>Darcy is both proud and reserved, and his demeanor is not very engaging, although he is very well-educated.</t283> <t284>In this regard, Bingley is somewhat superior, as he is liked by everyone wherever he goes, while Darcy continually offends people.</t284>
<t285>The way two people converse with each other at the ball clearly reflects their personalities.</t285> <t286>Bingley had never met a girl as charming and pretty as Jane in his life.</t286> <t287>Everyone was kind and considerate to him.</t287> <t288>Without being formal and stiff, he soon got acquainted with everyone in the room, but as for Jane Bennet, he felt no angel could be more beautiful.</t288> <t289>As for him, he found the whole crowd unremarkable, so he paid no attention to anyone, and no one paid attention to him either.</t289> <t290>He acknowledged that Jane was a beautiful girl, but he thought she smiled too much.</t290>
<t291>Mrs. Hurst and her younger sister thought the same, but they still liked her, considering her a pleasant, gentle young woman, and were not hesitant to learn more about her.</t291> <t292>Thus, Jane was acknowledged by everyone as gentle, which allowed Bingley to feel free to think of her whenever he wished.</t292>
<t293>Chapter 5</t293>
<t294>A short distance from Longbourn, there was a family well-acquainted with the Bennets.</t294> <t295>Sir William Lucas had previously conducted business in Meryton, building a considerable career and was knighted by the court when he held the position of mayor.</t295> <t296>Perhaps he felt this honor too intensely.</t296> <t297>He grew tired of business and his house in a small commercial town, so he abandoned both and moved his family to a house about a mile from Meryton.</t297> <t298>He named the house Lucas Lodge, where he could complacently consider himself an important person, unburdened by business matters, focusing solely on living up to the appearance of being a good citizen.</t298> <t299>He took pride in his knighthood but was not arrogant; on the contrary, he cared about everyone.</t299> <t300>With a nature that did not want to offend anyone, combined with his friendliness and accommodating disposition, his knighthood at St James's Palace had made him a courteous person.</t300>
<t301>Mrs. Lucas was a very gentle woman, not too wise, so she easily became a good neighbor to Mrs. Bennet.</t301> <t302>They had several children.</t302> <t303>Their eldest daughter, sensible and intelligent, about twenty-seven years old, was a close friend of Elizabeth.</t303>
<t304>The meeting of the Bennet and Lucas daughters to gossip about the ball was absolutely necessary.</t304> <t305>The next morning, the Lucas girls went to Longbourn to hear the news and chat with each other.</t305>
<t306>Mrs. Bennet said to Miss Lucas with an air of composure:</t306>
<t307>- Hey Charlotte, you started the ball off well.</t307> <t308>You were Mr. Bingley's first choice.</t308>
<t309>- That's right, but it seems he prefers the second option.</t309>
<t310>- Ah, you think that you mean Jane –</t310> <t311>Because he danced with her twice.</t311> <t312>It seems like he likes her – in fact, I believed so – I heard about it, but I don't know anything about... something about Mr. Robinson.</t312>
<t313>- Perhaps you think I overheard Mr. Bingley and Mr. Robinson talking to each other, have I told you about this? Mr. Robinson asked him what he thought of the Meryton ball, did he think there were many beautiful women in the room?</t313> <t314>He asked which lady he thought was the most beautiful.</t314> <t315>He immediately answered the last question – Ah!</t315> <t316>Surely the eldest Miss Bennet, indeed no one would disagree.</t316>
<t317>- So he had an intention, it seems like that... but it might not lead to anything, you know.</t317>
<t318>Charlotte said:</t318>
<t319>- Lizzy, the eavesdropping you did served a better purpose than my story, didn't it? Mr. Darcy's words aren't worth listening to, but your brother's words are, right?</t319> <t320>Poor Eliza, having to put up with it!</t320>
<t321>- I hope you don't put that matter into Lizzy's head to cause annoyance because of his mistreatment.</t321> <t322>Because he is such an unpleasant person, if he likes someone, that person is truly unfortunate.</t322> <t323>Last night, Mrs. Long told me that he sat next to her for half an hour without saying a word.</t323>
<t324>Jane asked:</t324>
<t325>- Mom, are you sure you're not mistaken? I clearly saw him talking to her.</t325>
<t326>- Ah, that's because she asked him if he liked living at Netherfield, so he had to answer, but she said he seemed very annoyed that someone brought it up.</t326>
<t327>Jane said:</t327>
<t328>- Miss Bingley told me that he never speaks much except with those he is very close to.</t328> <t329>With these people, he appears quite pleasant.</t329>
<t330>- I find it hard to believe.</t330> <t331>If he were really that pleasant, he would have conversed with Mrs. Long.</t331> <t332>But I can guess why: everyone says it's because he's too proud, and somehow he heard that Mrs. Long's family doesn't have a carriage and had to rent an old one to go to the ball.</t332>
<t333>Ms. Lucas said:</t333>
<t334>- I don't care if he talks to Mrs. Long or not, but I wish he would dance with Lizzy.</t334>
<t335>The mother told Elizabeth:</t335>
<t336>- Another time, Lizzy. If I were you, I wouldn't want to dance with him.</t336>
<t337>- I swear to you, Mom, and I can promise you that I will never dance with him.</t337>
<t338>Ms. Lucas said:</t338>
<t339>- His pride did not bother her, because there was some justifiable reason for it.</t339> <t340>We should not question why a young man who has so much: a noble family, immense wealth, would think of himself as noble.</t340> <t341>If she could say, he had the right to be proud.</t341>
<t342>- That is very true, I can easily forgive his pride, if he does not insult my pride.</t342>
<t343>Mary was still resentful of her sister's steadfast opinion:</t343>
<t344>- I believe that pride is a very common flaw.</t344> <t345>From what I have read, I believe that this is very prevalent, human nature tends to lean towards this defect.</t345> <t346>Among us, very few people do not have a self-satisfied thought in one way or another, whether real or imagined.</t346> <t347>Vanity and pride are two different things, although people often consider them synonymous.</t347> <t348>A person can feel pride without being vain.</t348> <t349>Pride is when we have an opinion of ourselves, vanity is when we want others to think of us in a certain way.</t349>
<t350>Lucas's younger sister exclaimed:</t350>
<t351>- If I were as wealthy as Mr. Darcy, I wouldn't need to feel so proud.</t351> <t352>I would raise a pack of hunting dogs and drink a bottle of wine every day.</t352>
<t353>- Then you will drink too much, if I catch you, I will take your bottle of wine immediately...</t353>
<t354>And the debate continued until parting ways.</t354>
<t355>Chapter 6</t355>
<t356>Thus, it wasn't long before the women at Longbourn visited Netherfield. They were properly reciprocated with visits.</t356> <t357>Jane Bennet's amiable nature won over Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.</t357> <t358>Despite their mother's unbearable attitude and her younger sisters being not worth mentioning, they all wanted to befriend the eldest sister.</t358> <t359>Jane felt very happy to be so well-regarded, but Elizabeth still noticed the arrogance of the other side in their treatment of everyone and even Jane, so she couldn't bring herself to like the two, although their kindness to Jane did influence Mr. Bingley's feelings.</t359> <t360>It was clear that whenever the two met, he genuinely showed his affection for her, and as for Jane, she liked him more as well, but she was glad that no one noticed this.</t360> <t361>She was a strong combination of calm temperament and enthusiastic demeanor, and these two traits concealed the suspicions of those who meddled in others' affairs.</t361> <t362>Elizabeth shared this with Charlotte Lucas.</t362> <t363>Charlotte replied:</t363>
<t364>- It might be a good thing to create such an impression for the public, but sometimes being too reserved can be disadvantageous.</t364> <t365>If a girl keeps hiding her feelings, she might miss the chance to make the guy notice her, and at that point, there's nothing left but to console herself when everyone else is just as clueless as she is.</t365> <t366>Almost every relationship requires a bit of appreciation or frivolity, to the extent that if everything is left to develop freely, there's no guarantee of anything.</t366> <t367>We can start comfortably – perhaps a gentle affection is natural, but very few of us can truly love without encouragement from the other side.</t367> <t368>In nine out of ten cases, a woman should express her admiration more than her feelings.</t368> <t369>Surely Bingley likes your sister, but he might stop there if she doesn't help him move forward.</t369>
<t370>- But in reality, Jane did show encouragement for him to advance further, within the limits that her dignity allowed.</t370> <t371>If you could sense her feelings, he would be a fool not to notice.</t371>
<t372>- Eliza, remember that he doesn't understand Jane's temperament as well as you do.</t372>
<t373>- But if a woman has special feelings for a man and does not intentionally hide them, he needs to understand clearly.</t373>
<t374>- Maybe he needs to find out, if he knows a lot about her.</t374> <t375>But although Jane and Bingley met quite often, they never met for long.</t375> <t376>Because they always met in crowds, they couldn't talk much to each other.</t376> <t377>Therefore, Jane needed to seize every moment to capture his feelings. Once she was sure she had won his heart, she could leisurely enjoy love as she pleased.</t377>
<t378>- Your plan is really good, there's nothing to doubt except for the desire to get married. If I were determined to marry a rich guy, or any guy for that matter, I would follow this way.</t378> <t379>But that's not Jane's feeling; she has no intention of acting.</t379> <t380>She is still unsure about her feelings, or whether this is reasonable or not.</t380> <t381>Jane has only known him for half a month.</t381> <t382>She has danced with him four times in Meryton, and only met him once at his house, and since then had dinner four times with him along with other people.</t382> <t383>These opportunities are not enough for Jane to understand much about him.</t383>
<t384>- You are right in the way you speak.</t384> <t385>If Jane simply had dinner with him, she could only know if he enjoyed his meal, but you should remember they have met for four evenings, and four evenings can create a lot of things.</t385>
<t386>- Yes, during the four evenings they helped each other see what recreational activities they both enjoy, but regarding their temperaments, I think they didn't reveal much.</t386>
<t387>- Ah, I truly hope Jane's wishes come true, and if she gets married tomorrow, I believe she will certainly be as happy as if she had known him for twelve months.</t387> <t388>Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance.</t388> <t389>If the two sides have mutual understanding beforehand, or if their temperaments are similar beforehand, it does not add to the happiness at all.</t389> <t390>They always plan to become entirely different people afterward, enough to annoy each other.</t390> <t391>Therefore, for the person with whom we are about to share our lives, it is best to know as little as possible about their flaws.</t391>
<t392>- You make me laugh, Charlotte, but what you're saying doesn't sound right at all.</t392> <t393>You must know it's not right, so I believe you would never act that way.</t393>
<t394>While busy observing the relationship between Bingley and her sister, Elizabeth did not expect that she would be a noteworthy subject in the eyes of Mr. Bingley's friend.</t394> <t395>Darcy initially did not think she was beautiful; he had seen her at the ball without feeling any admiration for her.</t395> <t396>And afterward, he looked at her only to criticize.</t396> <t397>But not long after, once he clearly saw and told his friends that he could hardly see any beauty in her face, he began to perceive that her face exuded an unusual intelligence, through the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.</t397> <t398>This discovery was something that embarrassed him no less.</t398> <t399>Although through his critical eyes he saw her figure as less proportionate, he had to admit that her form exuded a graceful attractiveness; although he criticized her gestures as not belonging to the upper class, he was captivated by her playful nature.</t399> <t400>Regarding this, she was completely unaware – to her, he was just someone who never felt comfortable anywhere, the person who had deemed her not beautiful enough to be worth asking to dance.</t400>
<t401>He began to want to learn more about her.</t401> <t402>To take the first step towards conversing with her, he joined in on her conversations with others.</t402> <t403>This caught her attention.</t403> <t404>That was when the Lucas family organized a large gathering.</t404>
<t405>Elizabeth said to Charlotte:</t405>
<t406>- What did Mr. Darcy mean when he commented on the conversation I was having with Colonel Forster?</t406>
<t407>- That is a question that only you can answer.</t407>
<t408>- But if he does that again, I will definitely let him know what I think of him.</t408> <t409>He has a very mocking eye, if I don't start off rudely, I will become afraid of him.</t409>
<t410>Immediately after that, the young man came over again, although he seemed reluctant to join the conversation.</t410> <t411>Miss Lucas dared her friend to mention to him what they had just discussed.</t411> <t412>Thus, Elizabeth was challenged, she turned to the young man and said:</t412>
<t413>- Mr. Darcy, do you think I made a good remark when I teased Colonel Forster about organizing a ball in Meryton?</t413>
<t414>- I support it enthusiastically, but I think this is the topic that you ladies always support the most enthusiastically.</t414>
<t415>- You are too strict with us.</t415>
<t416>- Now it's your turn to be teased, Eliza. I'll play the opening music, and then you know how to continue.</t416> <t417>– Lucas interjected.</t417>
<t418>- You are really strange compared to your friends – always wanting to sing and play music in front of everyone!</t418> <t419>If my frivolous nature has turned into music and poetry, it's because you have helped a lot.</t419> <t420>But I don't want to perform in front of people who expect to see the best performance.</t420>
<t421>However, as Miss Lucas insisted, she continued, looking over at Darcy:</t421>
<t422>- Alright, if it has to be that way, so be it.</t422> <t423>There is a very good proverb that everyone here knows: "Save your breath to cool the porridge," so I will save my breath to sing well.</t423>
<t424>Her performance was cute, though nothing extraordinary.</t424> <t425>After one or two pieces and before she could respond to the request to continue, the prelude began from her sister Mary, the most unpretentious child in the family, diligent in her pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement, always eager to display her skills.</t425>
<t426>Mary had neither genius nor taste, and though vanity had given her application, it had likewise given her a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached.</t426> <t427>Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had listened to her with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well herself.</t427> <t428>Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.</t428> <t429>The younger sisters were dancing at the other end of the room with the Miss Lucases and several of the officers.</t429>
<t430>Darcy stood in silent contempt of how to spend an evening like this, and withdrew from all conversation.</t430> <t431>He was so immersed in his own thoughts that he did not notice Sir William standing next to him until the latter spoke.</t431>
<t432>- Mr. Darcy, it is truly delightful for the young ones! There is nothing better than dancing.</t432> <t433>I consider dancing to be the first refined pleasure of elegant society.</t433>
<t434>- Yes, sir.</t434> <t435>Dancing is also a popular trend in less refined societies around the world.</t435> <t436>All primitive people can dance.</t436>
<t437>Sir William just smiled.</t437>
<t438>- I applaud your friend's performance...</t438>
<t439>He paused for a moment when he saw Bingley join the conversation group, then continued:</t439>
<t440>- And I am certain that you are well-versed in the humanities, Mr. Darcy.</t440>
<t441>- I think you saw me dancing at Meryton.</t441>
<t442>- Yes, that's right.</t442> <t443>I am extremely delighted with the view I witnessed.</t443> <t444>Do you often dance at St James's Palace?</t444>
<t445>- Never before, sir.</t445>
<t446>- Do you think that there should be proper praise for that place?</t446>
<t447>- That is the praise I have never bestowed upon any other place, if I could avoid it.</t447>
<t448>- I guess your house is in the city, is that right?</t448>
<t449>Darcy just leaned over without saying anything.</t449>
<t450>- There were times when I thought about settling down in the city because I enjoy high society, but it seems that the atmosphere in London does not suit Lady Lucas.</t450>
<t451>He stopped, waiting for an answer, but the young man was unwilling to say another word.</t451> <t452>Just then, Elizabeth was approaching them, and he suddenly had the idea to do something very chivalrous, so he called her:</t452>
<t453>- Dear Eliza, why are you not dancing?</t453> <t454>Mr. Darcy, allow me to introduce this young lady to you as a most desirable dance partner.</t454> <t455>I am sure you cannot refuse, when such a wonderful beauty is before you.</t455>
<t456>Then taking her hand, he should have led her to Darcy, who was very surprised but not entirely unwilling, but she immediately retreated and said with some embarrassment:</t456>
<t457>- Actually, sir, I have no intention of dancing at all.</t457> <t458>Please do not think that I came here to find a dance partner.</t458>
<t459>With all due propriety, Darcy requested the honor from her hand, but was refused.</t459> <t460>Elizabeth was resolute, and even Sir William could not sway her despite his efforts to persuade.</t460>
<t461>- Eliza, you dance so beautifully that it would be truly unkind if you did not grant me the pleasure of watching you perform.</t461> <t462>Although this gentleman does not like to participate in the game, I am sure he will not refuse to indulge us for half an hour.</t462>
<t463>Elizabeth smiled:</t463>
<t464>- Mr. Darcy is just being polite.</t464>
<t465>- It is true, my dear Elizabeth, but given the circumstances, it would not be surprising if he were willing to comply with us, for who could refuse someone like you?</t465>
<t466>Elizabeth cast a mischievous glance, then turned away.</t466> <t467>To the young man, the opposition had not harmed her.</t467> <t468>He was thinking of her with a bit of satisfaction when Miss Bingley approached.</t468>
<t469>- I can guess the topic you are thinking about.</t469>
<t470>- I don't believe so.</t470>
<t471>- I am thinking that it is unbearable to go through many evenings like this – in a society like this.</t471> <t472>Actually, I agree with you. I have never felt as uncomfortable as tonight.</t472> <t473>The dullness, plus the noise, and on top of that, the condescending attitude of these people.</t473> <t474>I want to do something to hear you condemn them strongly.</t474>
<t475>- Please believe that your estimation is completely wrong.</t475> <t476>My mind is feeling at ease.</t476> <t477>I am contemplating with all the joy that a pair of beautiful eyes on the face of a beautiful woman can bestow upon me.</t477>
<t478>Miss Bingley immediately looked straight into his eyes, implying that she wanted him to reveal which woman had inspired such thoughts in him.</t478> <t479>And Darcy boldly replied:</t479>
<t480>- Miss Elizabeth Bennet!</t480>
<t481>- Miss Elizabeth Bennet!</t481> <t482>I am very surprised.</t482> <t483>How long have you been fond of her?</t483> <t484>And please let me know when I can congratulate you?</t484>
<t485>- That is the question I was waiting for you to ask.</t485> <t486>The imagination of women is truly quick, in just a moment it leaps from admiration to love, from love to marriage.</t486> <t487>I know you intend to congratulate me.</t487>
<t488>- No, if you are serious about this, I will consider it as absolutely settled.</t488> <t489>In fact, you will have a charming mother-in-law, who will of course always come to live at Pemberly with you.</t489>
<t490>He listened to her with complete indifference, while she took pleasure in speaking in this manner, and as his calm demeanor showed that she was not being stopped, she became even more mischievous.</t490>
<t491>Chapter 7</t491>
<t492>Mr. Bennet's income consisted almost entirely of two thousand pounds a year.</t492> <t493>Unfortunately for the daughters, the default heir was a distant male relative.</t493> <t494>The mother's fortune could not make up for the deficiencies.</t494> <t495>Her father had practiced law in Meryton and left her four thousand pounds.</t495>
<t496>She has a younger sister who married Mr. Phillips, who worked as a clerk for her father and then continued his career.</t496> <t497>One of her younger brothers lives in London, works in business, and has a bit of a reputation.</t497>
<t498>The village of Longburn is only a mile away from Meryton, a convenient distance for young girls who wish to go there three or four times a week to visit their aunt and incidentally stop by the fashion shops.</t498> <t499>In particular, the two youngest daughters of the Bennet family, Catherine and Lydia, often made such trips.</t499> <t500>Their minds were usually less occupied than their older sisters', so when there was nothing better to do, they felt the need to walk to Meryton to enjoy the morning moments and have more topics to talk about in the evening. Even if there was no special news, they always managed to learn something from their aunt.</t500> <t501>At present, they received news about a regiment of militia that had just moved to camp for the entire winter, with Meryton as the headquarters.</t501>
<t502>The visits to Mrs. Phillips now generated news of interest.</t502> <t503>Every day they learned more about the names of the officers and their relationships.</t503> <t504>The location of their camp could not remain a secret for long, so eventually the girls became acquainted with them.</t504> <t505>Mr. Phillips had visited them all, and this opened up an unprecedented source of joy for the nieces.</t505> <t506>They only talked about the officers.</t506> <t507>The great fortune of Bingley, which had caused much excitement for the mother upon hearing about it, now became meaningless in the eyes of the young girl.</t507>
<t508>After listening to the ladies chatter all morning, Mr. Bennet coldly remarked:</t508>
<t509>- According to what I see from the way you two talk, you two are the dumbest girls in the country.</t509> <t510>I had suspected this, but now I believe it's true.</t510>
<t511>Catherine was confused and did not answer, but Lydia was completely indifferent, continuing to talk about her admiration for Captain Carter, about how she hoped to see him that day, because the next day he would be going to London.</t511>
<t512>Mrs. Bennet said:</t512>
<t513>- Sir! I am surprised to see that you think your children are foolish.</t513> <t514>I can despise other people's children, but I cannot despise my own.</t514>
<t515>- If my children are foolish, I will always sympathize with them.</t515>
<t516>- Yes, with what has happened, they are all very wise.</t516>
<t517>- I am complacent that this is just a point on which we disagree.</t517> <t518>I had expected that our feelings would coincide in everything, but now I must disagree with you when you think that our two little daughters are unusually foolish.</t518>
<t519>- You shouldn't expect your children to have the same awareness as their parents.</t519> <t520>When they are my age, I'm sure they won't think about officers anymore.</t520> <t521>I still remember a time when I loved the uniform with the red cloak, and in fact, even now I still like it in my heart.</t521> <t522>If now a young, handsome colonel with five or six thousand pounds a year wanted to marry my daughter, I wouldn't refuse.</t522> <t523>I think Colonel Foster looked very elegant in his uniform at Sir William's reception that day.</t523>
<t524>Lydia exclaimed:</t524>
<t525>- Mom, my aunt said that Colonel Foster and Captain Carter don't visit Mrs. Watson's house as often as they did when they first moved in. Now they usually stand in the reading room of the Clark house.</t525>
<t526>While Mrs. Bennet had not yet had time to reply, a servant brought Jane a letter from Netherfield and stood waiting for a response.</t526> <t527>Mrs. Bennet's eyes lit up with joy, and she eagerly asked as her daughter was reading:</t527>
<t528>- So Jane, whose letter is it? What does he say? Jane, read it quickly and tell everyone, hurry up my dear.</t528>
<t529>- That is Miss Bingley's letter.</t529>
<t530>Then she read aloud:</t530>
<t531>“Dear sister,</t531>
<t532>If you do not make the effort to come visit and join us for dinner tonight with Louisa and me, I fear that we will become estranged for life, because a confrontation between two women cannot end when there is conflict.</t532> <t533>Upon receiving this letter, please come immediately.</t533> <t534>My brother and a few others will be dining with the officers.</t534>
<t535>Dear,</t535>
<t536>Caroline Bingley</t536>
<t537>Lydia exclaimed:</t537>
<t538>- For the officers! I wonder why my aunt didn't tell us about this.</t538>
<t539>Mrs. Bennet said:</t539>
<t540>- Having dinner at their place, unfortunately.</t540>
<t541>Jane asked:</t541>
<t542>- Can I use the carriage?</t542>
<t543>- No, my dear, you should ride a horse because it might rain, and then you would have to stay the night.</t543>
<t544>- It could be a clever scheme, if you're sure they won't volunteer to take you back.</t544>
<t545>- Ah! But you will use Bingley's carriage to go to Meryton, and Mr. and Mrs. Hurst do not have horses.</t545>
<t546>- Nhung wants to ride a horse-drawn carriage.</t546>
<t547>- But my dear, I believe your father doesn't want you to use the horses.</t547> <t548>We need them to work on the farm, don't we, dear?</t548>
<t549>- I often need them, but I rarely get to use them.</t549>
<t550>Elizabeth said:</t550>
<t551>- But if you use the horses today, mother's purpose will be achieved.</t551>
<t552>In the end, she made her father admit that the horses were busy.</t552> <t553>Therefore, Jane had to ride a horse, and her mother saw her off at the door with many predictions about bad weather.</t553> <t554>Her mother's hope came true when it started raining shortly after Jane left.</t554> <t555>Her sisters were worried about her, but Mrs. Bennet seemed pleased.</t555> <t556>The rain continued throughout the evening without stopping, making it clear that Jane could not return home.</t556> <t557>And the next day, Mrs. Bennet's joy was multiplied when a servant from Netherfield brought a letter for Elizabeth:</t557>
<t558>“Dear Lizzy,</t558>
<t559>I felt much weaker this morning, I think it might be because I got soaked in the rain all day yesterday.</t559> <t560>The friends here absolutely won't let me go home until I recover.</t560> <t561>They also want me to meet Mr. Jones – so don't worry when you hear that he's coming to check on me.</t561> <t562>Besides a sore throat and headache, I don't have anything else.</t562>
<t563>My older sister</t563>
<t564>Mr. Bennet said after hearing Elizabeth read the letter:</t564>
<t565>- So if your daughter falls seriously ill, and if anything happens to her, you can console yourself that it was due to pursuing Mr. Bingley under your direction.</t565>
<t566>- Ah, I am sure it is not as dangerous as you say.</t566> <t567>People never die from a common cold. It will be well taken care of.</t567> <t568>I will visit it, if I can use the carriage.</t568>
<t569>Elizabeth felt anxious and decided to visit Jane even though there was no carriage.</t569> <t570>Since she did not know how to ride a horse, she had no choice but to walk.</t570> <t571>When she expressed her intention, her mother was astonished:</t571>
<t572>- How could you be so reckless, with all that dust.</t572> <t573>By the time you get there, you'll be exhausted and your face will be a mess.</t573>
<t574>- I will still have the strength to check on Jane's condition – that's all I want.</t574>
<t575>- Lizzy, are you implying that you want Dad to allow you to use the carriage?</t575>
<t576>- Actually, no.</t576> <t577>I don't want to avoid having to walk.</t577> <t578>The distance isn't that far, when one is motivated it's only three miles.</t578> <t579>I'll be home before dinner.</t579>
<t580>Mary said:</t580>
<t581>- I admire your compassion, but all emotional impulses need to be guided by reason.</t581> <t582>In my opinion, you should only act to the necessary extent.</t582>
<t583>Catherine and Lydia expressed their desire to accompany their sister to Meryton.</t583> <t584>Elizabeth agreed, and all three set off together.</t584> <t585>Lydia said:</t585>
<t586>- If we go quickly, you can meet and chat a bit with Captain Carter before he leaves.</t586>
<t587>They parted ways at Meryton, the two younger sisters went to the residential area of the officers' wives, while Elizabeth continued on alone, hurriedly crossing the fields with swift steps, jumping over stiles, and leaping over puddles.</t587> <t588>Finally, she arrived with weary legs, dirty stockings, and a flushed face from exertion.</t588>
<t589>She was invited into the breakfast room, where everyone was present except Jane.</t589> <t590>Her appearance caused extreme surprise among everyone.</t590> <t591>Mr. Hurst and Miss Bingley could hardly believe that Elizabeth had walked three miles at such an early hour, in muddy weather, and all by herself.</t591> <t592>Elizabeth believed that they looked down on her.</t592> <t593>However, they still treated her very politely, and in the manner of the gentlemen, there was something more than mere politeness.</t593> <t594>Mr. Darcy spoke very little, and Mr. Hurst almost nothing at all.</t594> <t595>Darcy's thoughts were dominated by admiration for the brilliance that the walk had brought to her face, but his mind was filled with doubts about the true reason she had to go so far alone.</t595>
<t596>After inquiring about Jane's condition, but the answer was not very positive, Jane did not sleep well, was having a fever because she was too weak, and was still lying in the bedroom.</t596> <t597>Elizabeth was delighted to be led into the room to visit her sister.</t597> <t598>Everyone had hidden Jane's illness for fear of causing panic or trouble, Jane was truly happy to see her step in.</t598> <t599>However, she could not talk much.</t599> <t600>When Miss Bingley stepped outside to let the two sisters talk freely, Jane could do nothing but express her gratitude for the kindness everyone had shown her.</t600> <t601>Elizabeth silently took care of her sister.</t601>
<t602>When breakfast was over, the host girls played with the two sisters, and Elizabeth began to feel fond of them as she saw their concern and care for Jane.</t602> <t603>The doctor was also invited to examine Jane, and he stated that she had a severe cold, advising everyone to be practical about the situation, and that Jane needed to rest in bed.</t603> <t604>The advice was immediately followed, as the fever showed signs of worsening, and on top of that, her head ached terribly. Elizabeth did not want to leave the room, and everyone still came in and out to inquire about her.</t604>
<t605>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth thought that she needed to leave, although she very much wanted to stay. Miss Bingley suggested that she use the family's carriage.</t605> <t606>In her heart, Elizabeth hoped that if they just insisted a little, she would agree, and Jane also expressed that she did not want to be separated from her sister.</t606> <t607>Miss Bingley had to invite Elizabeth to stay at Netherfield for a while, and Elizabeth accepted.</t607> <t608>Immediately, a servant was sent to Longbourn to deliver the news and bring back some clothes.</t608>
<t609>Chapter 8</t609>
<t610>At five o'clock, Jane and Elizabeth changed clothes to have dinner.</t610> <t611>Everyone inquired about Jane's health, and Elizabeth noticed that Bingley was genuinely deeply concerned about Jane, but she could not provide a more favorable answer; Jane's condition had not improved at all.</t611> <t612>Three or four times, the girls expressed their distress over Jane's illness and mentioned that they felt extremely sad for not being able to help more, and then they no longer paid any attention to the matter.</t612> <t613>The indifference of the two towards Jane when she was not present made Elizabeth revert to her initial unfavorable impressions of them.</t613>
<t614>In fact, Bingley was the only one she had a tolerant idea of.</t614> <t615>Clearly, he was very worried about Jane.</t615> <t616>His attitude was very proper, making her feel unintruded upon in her private life unlike others.</t616> <t617>She no longer cared about anyone else but him. Miss Bingley was strongly attracted to Darcy and always stuck close to him.</t617> <t618>As for Mr. Hurst, sitting next to Elizabeth, he was a lazy person who lived only to eat and play cards, and upon learning that she only liked simple dishes instead of stews, he didn't know what to say to her.</t618>
<t619>When dinner was over, she immediately returned to Jane, and Miss Bingley immediately began to speak ill of her friend.</t619> <t620>Her attitude was truly despicable, a mix of pride and insolence.</t620> <t621>She remarked that Elizabeth had no conversational skills, no appreciation, and was not beautiful.</t621> <t622>Mrs. Hurst shared the same thoughts and added her own comments:</t622>
<t623>- In summary, she has nothing worth praising except for her good walking legs.</t623> <t624>I will never forget when she appeared this morning.</t624> <t625>She looked really wild.</t625>
<t626>- That's right, Louisa.</t626> <t627>It's hard for you to accept.</t627> <t628>It's so pointless to come all the way here.</t628> <t629>Why did she have to travel so many miles just because her sister had a cold?</t629> <t630>Her hair was messy and ugly.</t630>
<t631>- Yes, and then there's the petticoat, I wish you could see her petticoat, covered in an inch of mud, with the outer dress let down to cover the mud but failing to do so.</t631>
<t632>Bingley said:</t632>
<t633>- You may describe it accurately.</t633> <t634>But I don't see it that way.</t634> <t635>I think Miss Elizabeth looked quite nice when she walked in this morning.</t635> <t636>I didn't notice her petticoat was dirty.</t636>
<t637>- Mr. Darcy, I am sure you have seen such a situation, so I believe you would never want to see your sister in such a state.</t637> <t638>– Miss Bingley continued.</t638>
<t639>- Certainly not.</t639> <t640>Walking three miles or four miles or any distance, with mud up to your ankles, and going alone!</t640> <t641>What does she mean by that? To me, it seems like a detestable display of arrogant self-reliance, an indifference to etiquette, characteristic of the most rustic small-town folk.</t641>
<t642>- This shows her concern for her sister, which is very nice.</t642> <t643>–</t643> <t644>Bingley defended her.</t644>
<t645>Miss Bingley whispered privately to Darcy:</t645>
<t646>Mr. Darcy, I fear this adventure will affect your admiration for her beautiful eyes.</t646>
<t647>- No, her eyes were radiant because of the trip.</t647>
<t648>After a moment of silence, Mrs. Hurst began again:</t648>
<t649>- I am extremely fond of Jane Bennet; she is a very gentle girl, and with all my sincerity, I wish for her to soon settle down.</t649> <t650>But with such a father and mother, and additionally, low social connections, I fear there is no opportunity for this.</t650>
<t651>- I heard that their uncle practices law in Meryton.</t651>
<t652>- That's right, they have an uncle who lives somewhere near Cheapside.</t652>
<t653>Mrs. Hurst's younger sister interjected:</t653>
<t654>- That's wonderful.</t654>
<t655>Both sisters laughed triumphantly.</t655> <t656>Bingley exclaimed in surprise:</t656>
<t657>- Even if they had enough uncles or cousins to fill Cheapside, it wouldn't make them any more unpleasant.</t657>
<t658>Darcy replied:</t658>
<t659>- But they will have very little chance of getting a husband with any significant status in society.</t659>
<t660>Bingley did not reply, but his sisters eagerly agreed and joked for a long time about their friend's humble social connections.</t660>
<t661>However, they regained their kindness and gentleness after leaving the dining room, returning to where Jane was lying, and sat with her until they were called for coffee.</t661> <t662>Jane was still very weak and Elizabeth refused to leave her side.</t662> <t663>It wasn't until late at night, when she saw that her sister had fallen asleep, that Elizabeth thought she should go downstairs.</t663> <t664>As she entered the hall, she saw everyone playing cards, and they immediately invited her to join.</t664> <t665>Thinking she might be a bother, she declined, using the excuse of tending to her sister, and expressed a desire to entertain herself for a while with a book.</t665> <t666>Mr. Hurst looked at her in surprise:</t666>
<t667>- Do you prefer reading books over playing cards? That's really eccentric.</t667>
<t668>- Miss Elizabeth Bennet hates playing cards.</t668> <t669>She is very good at reading books and has no other hobbies.</t669> <t670>– Miss Bingley mocked.</t670>
<t671>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t671>
<t672>- I do not deserve such praise or criticism.</t672> <t673>I am not good at reading books; I have many other hobbies.</t673>
<t674>- You take pleasure in nursing your sister, so we hope you will have greater pleasure in seeing her recovered.</t674> <t675>– Bingley said.</t675>
<t676>Elizabeth silently thanked him and went to a table where a few books were placed.</t676> <t677>He immediately offered to help her find other titles still in the library.</t677>
<t678>- I wish to have a richer family library to help you and to increase my knowledge, but I am lazy. Even though I don't have many books, I still can't read them all.</t678>
<t679>Elizabeth reassured him that the books in the room were perfectly suitable for her. Caroline Bingley said:</t679>
<t680>I'm surprised that my father left so few books.</t680> <t681>Darcy, you have a very valuable library at Pemberley.</t681>
<t682>Darcy replied:</t682>
<t683>- It is indeed a fortune, it is the work of many generations.</t683>
<t684>- And then he added to his collection, he always liked buying books.</t684>
<t685>- I cannot understand such a negligent attitude towards the family bookshelf in this day and age.</t685>
<t686>- Distracted! I am sure you haven't overlooked anything to add to the beauty of that house.</t686> <t687>Charles, when you finish building your house, I hope it can be half as beautiful as the Pemberly estate.</t687>
<t688>- I hope so.</t688>
<t689>- But I sincerely advise you to buy a house in that area, using the Pemberly estate as a model.</t689> <t690>There is no county in all of England as good as Derbyshire.</t690>
<t691>- He is willing to buy Pemberly if Darcy agrees to sell it.</t691>
<t692>- Charles, I'm talking about possibilities.</t692>
<t693>- Caroline, I give you my word of honor that I believe it is more feasible to approach Pemberly by purchasing it than by imagining it.</t693>
<t694>Elizabeth was so surprised by what was happening that she no longer focused on the book she was holding, and soon put it aside. She went to the card table, standing between Bingley and his sister to observe the game.</t694>
<t695>Miss Bingley said:</t695>
<t696>- Has Miss Darcy grown much since last spring? Is she as tall as I am?</t696>
<t697>- I think that maybe so.</t697> <t698>Now she is almost as tall as Miss Elizabeth, or maybe even taller.</t698>
<t699>- I really want to meet her again.</t699> <t700>I have never met anyone as pleasant as her.</t700> <t701>Her face and gestures are truly adorable.</t701> <t702>Her piano playing is truly unique.</t702>
<t703>Bingley said:</t703>
<t704>- I am amazed at how young girls have enough perseverance to achieve so many talents; all of them are truly talented.</t704>
<t705>- Are all young girls talented? Dear Charles, what do you mean by that?</t705>
<t706>- That's right, I think all the girls are very talented.</t706> <t707>All of them can paint tables and chairs, hang curtains, and knit purses.</t707> <t708>I see that few people cannot do these things, and I am sure that the girls being mentioned are all talented.</t708>
<t709>Darcy said:</t709>
<t710>- Your list of common talents is quite accurate.</t710> <t711>This world has many women who are only commendable for knitting purses or hanging curtains.</t711> <t712>But I don't quite agree with your way of evaluating women.</t712> <t713>Among all the people I know, I can't boast of knowing more than half a dozen women who are truly talented.</t713>
<t714>Miss Bingley added:</t714>
<t715>- Me neither, I'm sure of it.</t715>
<t716>- Then, you must have a very thorough understanding of what it means to be an accomplished woman.</t716> <t717>– Elizabeth remarked.</t717>
<t718>- Yes, indeed I know very well about this issue.</t718>
<t719>Darcy's loyal assistant exclaimed:</t719>
<t720>- Ah! That's right.</t720> <t721>No one can be considered complete if they do not overcome what they usually have to face.</t721> <t722>A woman must have a thorough understanding of music, vocals, dance, and foreign languages to be worthy of that title.</t722> <t723>And besides these aspects, she must also have something in her demeanor and posture when moving, the tone of her voice, the way she addresses and expresses herself, otherwise, she is only worthy of half the words.</t723>
<t724>Darcy added:</t724>
<t725>- She must have all of these things, and in addition to that, she must have something substantial in the way of expanding her knowledge by reading a lot.</t725>
<t726>- I am no longer surprised that you only know six perfect women.</t726> <t727>I want to know if you currently know any such woman?</t727>
<t728>- Are you too strict about your gender, thus doubting your ability to achieve all these talents?</t728>
<t729>- I have never met a woman like that.</t729> <t730>I have never had the honor of meeting such a talent, combined with taste, diligence, and the refined personality as you described, all in one person.</t730>
<t731>Both Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley voiced their objections, claiming that she was being unfair in her doubts.</t731> <t732>While the two were arguing that they knew many women who fit that description, Mr. Hurst called for order with a bitter complaint that they had disregarded what they were supposed to be doing.</t732> <t733>Thus, all conversation ceased, and afterward, Elizabeth left the room.</t733>
<t734>When the door had closed behind Elizabeth, Miss Bingley said:</t734>
<t735>- Elizabeth Bennet is one of those girls who wants to introduce herself to others by undervaluing herself, and I am convinced that this works with many people.</t735> <t736>But in my opinion, it is a trick, a very poor art.</t736>
<t737>Darcy replied to her:</t737>
<t738>- There is certainly an inadequacy in all the arts that you ladies occasionally use to win over men.</t738> <t739>Everything related to cunning is contemptible.</t739>
<t740>Miss Bingley was not entirely satisfied with the answer to continue the subject.</t740>
<t741>Elizabeth came in again just to say that her sister's condition had worsened, and she could not leave her side.</t741> <t742>Bingley urged them to call Mr. Jones, while the two sisters believed that the country doctor could not help and suggested urgently inviting a renowned doctor from the city.</t742> <t743>Elizabeth did not agree with the sisters, but she was not as reluctant with Bingley's suggestion.</t743> <t744>Everyone then agreed that if Jane did not get better, they would call Mr. Jones early in the morning.</t744> <t745>Bingley clearly appeared very restless, while the Bingley sisters claimed they felt very distressed upon hearing this news.</t745> <t746>However, after dinner, the two sisters amused themselves with duets, while Mr. Bingley could do nothing more than order the servants to do everything possible to care for the patient and her sister.</t746>
<t747>Chapter 9</t747>
<t748>Elizabeth spent the night in the same room as her sister.</t748> <t749>In the morning, the servants conveyed the regards of Mr. Bingley and his two sisters to them.</t749> <t750>And Eliza could be pleased because the doctor's response was not too pessimistic.</t750> <t751>Although Jane's condition had improved, she still requested that news be sent to Longbourn about her situation and expressed a desire for her mother to visit her.</t751> <t752>The letter was sent immediately and her mother responded at once.</t752> <t753>Mrs. Bennet and her two youngest daughters arrived at Netherfield just after breakfast.</t753>
<t754>If Mrs. Bennet saw Jane in any obvious danger, she would feel extremely distressed.</t754> <t755>But upon arriving and being reassured that her illness was not serious, she did not wish for her to recover immediately, lest she have to leave Netherfield. Therefore, she did not heed her daughter's request to return home.</t755> <t756>The doctor felt the same way.</t756> <t757>After sitting with Jane, all four of them were invited by Miss Bingley into the breakfast room.</t757> <t758>Bingley met them with the hope that Mrs. Bennet did not think Jane's condition was worse than she initially feared.</t758>
<t759>Mrs. Bennet said:</t759>
<t760>- Actually, I fear Jane's illness is quite severe, so she cannot walk.</t760> <t761>Mr. Jones said we shouldn't let the girl move.</t761> <t762>We are forced to trouble your family for a little while longer.</t762>
<t763>Bingley exclaimed:</t763>
<t764>- Move! Don't think about this.</t764> <t765>I am sure that my sister doesn't want her to move.</t765>
<t766>- Madam, you can rely on us. Miss Bennet will be well taken care of during her stay here. – Miss Bingley said.</t766>
<t767>Mrs. Bennet thanked them warmly.</t767> <t768>She added:</t768>
<t769>- I am sure that if it weren't for such good friends, I don't know what would have happened to Jane.</t769> <t770>Because Jane has really weakened a lot and suffered a lot.</t770> <t771>Although Jane has enough perseverance to endure.</t771> <t772>She is the gentlest girl I have ever seen.</t772> <t773>I often tell my other girls that they cannot compare to their sister.</t773> <t774>Mr. Bingley, you have a really elegant room, with the charming exterior view through the gravel path out there.</t774> <t775>I have never seen a place as beautiful as Netherfield.</t775> <t776>I hope you don't intend to leave this place in a hurry, even though I know you are only renting it short-term.</t776>
<t777>- I decide everything quickly, so if I am determined to leave Netherfield, I could be on my way within five minutes.</t777> <t778>However, at this moment I want to settle here. –</t778> <t779>Bingley replied.</t779>
<t780>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t780>
<t781>- That is exactly what I guessed about you.</t781>
<t782>- You are starting to understand me, aren't you? –</t782> <t783>He turned towards her and exclaimed.</t783>
<t784>- Ah yes, I think I understand you quite well.</t784>
<t785>- I hope this is a compliment.</t785> <t786>But being seen through completely is really pitiful for me.</t786>
<t787>- But this does not necessarily mean that a person with a deep and sophisticated personality like you has to make themselves appear more enigmatic.</t787>
<t788>The mother exclaimed:</t788>
<t789>- Lizzy, remember where you are, don't be as carefree as you are at home.</t789>
<t790>Bingley immediately continued:</t790>
<t791>- I didn't know before that you often explore personalities.</t791> <t792>This must be an interesting field of study.</t792>
<t793>- Yes, the most enjoyable are the complex personalities, at least there's an advantage in that.</t793>
<t794>- The entire country can only provide a few such individuals.</t794> <t795>In the countryside, we move within a very limited and unchanging society.</t795>
<t796>- But people themselves change so much that we can always observe something new in them.</t796>
<t797>Mrs. Bennet said, with a look of displeasure because he had mentioned the countryside:</t797>
<t798>- Yes, that's right.</t798> <t799>I assure you that many such things happen in the countryside as well as in the city.</t799>
<t800>Everyone was surprised.</t800> <t801>Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, silently turned away.</t801> <t802>Thinking she had overwhelmingly won against him, Mrs. Bennet continued her victorious momentum:</t802>
<t803>As for me, I don't see any significant advantages that London has over the countryside, except for the shops and public facilities.</t803> <t804>The countryside is much more pleasant, isn't it, Mr. Bingley?</t804>
<t805>- When I lived in the countryside, I never wanted to leave, and when I moved to the city, it was the same.</t805> <t806>Each place has its own advantages, so I find happiness wherever I am.</t806>
<t807>- That's right, because you have a moderate temperament.</t807> <t808>But this friend here – she looked over at Mr. Darcy – seems to think that the countryside is nothing at all.</t808>
<t809>Elizabeth blushed because of her mother:</t809>
<t810>- Mom! Actually, you misunderstood Mr. Darcy's point. He just meant that people living in the countryside are not as diverse as those in the city, you have to admit this.</t810>
<t811>- That's right, my child, but regarding not meeting the people in this community, I think there aren't many communities larger than this place.</t811> <t812>We have had dinner with more than forty families.</t812>
<t813>Only his concern for Elizabeth allowed Bingley to maintain a calm demeanor.</t813> <t814>His sister was less discreet, casting a meaningful glance towards Darcy.</t814> <t815>To divert her mother, Elizabeth asked if Charlotte Lucas had visited Longbourn since she had left.</t815>
<t816>- She went with her father. Sir William is really a pleasant person, isn't he, Mr. Bingley? He is a man of fashion, so gentle, so profound.</t816> <t817>He always has something to say to everyone.</t817> <t818>That is my idea of a well-bred person; those who consider themselves important and never open their mouths are greatly mistaken.</t818>
<t819>- Did Charlotte have a meal with her mother?</t819>
<t820>- No, she wants to go home.</t820> <t821>Mother guesses the person she needs to see is the minced meat pie.</t821> <t822>As for me, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants who can get the job done.</t822> <t823>My daughters are educated differently.</t823> <t824>But let everyone judge for themselves.</t824> <t825>Although the Lucas girls are very nice, believe me.</t825> <t826>But they are not beautiful, which is a pity.</t826> <t827>Not that I find Charlotte unattractive – but she is still a special friend of my family.</t827>
<t828>Bingley said:</t828>
<t829>- She seems to be very likable.</t829>
<t830>- Ah, that's right, but you have to admit that she is not beautiful.</t830> <t831>Lady Lucas herself often says so and feels envious of our Jane.</t831> <t832>I don't want to boast about my children, but it is certain that Jane is the most beautiful girl in the area.</t832> <t833>That is what everyone says.</t833> <t834>When she was fifteen, there was a young man living with Mr. Gardiner, my brother, in the city, who loved her so much that my sister-in-law thought he would propose to her.</t834> <t835>But in the end, he did not, perhaps because he thought she was too young.</t835> <t836>However, he wrote her some truly wonderful poems.</t836>
<t837>Elizabeth anxiously said:</t837>
<t838>- So that's the end of his love.</t838> <t839>I guess many people also get over their sadness in the same way.</t839> <t840>I've wondered who discovered the power of poetry in dispelling love.</t840>
<t841>- And yet I still think poetry is the food of love. – Darcy said.</t841>
<t842>- It may be so for delicate, enduring, and healthy love.</t842> <t843>Everything can nurture what is already strong.</t843> <t844>But I believe that with a bit of fragile love, a short poem can make that love entirely starved.</t844>
<t845>Darcy merely smiled, and the ensuing moment of silence made Elizabeth fear that her mother might once again expose her own shortsightedness.</t845> <t846>She wanted to say something but did not know how to begin.</t846> <t847>Then Mrs. Bennet began thanking Bingley for taking care of Jane, adding an apology for Lizzy's interruption.</t847> <t848>Bingley responded politely, and his sister was obliged to say a few polite words as well.</t848> <t849>Miss Bingley tried to fulfill her role without much grace, just enough to satisfy Mrs. Bennet.</t849> <t850>After that, she requested the carriage to be prepared.</t850> <t851>At this signal, the youngest daughter escorted her outside.</t851> <t852>The two had been whispering to each other throughout the visit, resulting in the youngest demanding that Bingley host a ball when he came over.</t852>
<t853>Lydia is a fifteen-year-old girl, sturdy, with fair skin and a cheerful face.</t853> <t854>She is her mother's darling, so her mother introduced her to social interactions at a very young age.</t854> <t855>She has a lively temperament and a self-important demeanor, which draws the attention of officers who often visit her uncle's house. Combined with her simple manners, these interactions have made her more confident.</t855> <t856>Therefore, she considers herself equal enough to talk to Bingley about organizing the ball and suddenly reminds him to keep his promise.</t856> <t857>She also adds that if he does not keep his word, it would be the most shameful thing in the world.</t857> <t858>His response made her mother very happy.</t858>
<t859>- Please believe that I am very willing to keep my promise, and when your sister recovers, if you wish, you can set the date and time.</t859> <t860>But I believe you wouldn't want to dance while your sister is still weak.</t860>
<t861>- Ah yes.</t861> <t862>It would be better to wait until Jane is well, and by then Captain Carter might have returned to Meryton.</t862> <t863>And when he organizes the ball, I will insist that they hold a ball as well.</t863> <t864>I will tell Colonel Foster that it would be a shame if he refused.</t864>
<t865>Mrs. Bennet and her two daughters left, Elizabeth returned to Jane, leaving her mother's and two sisters' behavior to the judgment of the two women and Darcy. However, Darcy did not want to join the two in criticizing Mrs. Bennet, even though Miss Bingley had made some insinuations about her dark eyes.</t865>
<t866>Chapter 10</t866>
<t867>A day passed similarly to the previous one.</t867> <t868>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley spent a few hours in the morning sitting with Jane, who was gradually recovering.</t868> <t869>In the evening, Elizabeth sat with them in the drawing room.</t869> <t870>Mr. Darcy was writing a letter, Miss Bingley sat beside him, constantly watching what he was doing, which distracted Darcy from writing the letter to his sister.</t870> <t871>Mr. Hurst and Bingley were playing cards, and Mrs. Hurst watched them play.</t871>
<t872>Elizabeth was sitting and embroidering, but she also found it amusing to pay attention to what was happening between Darcy and Miss Bingley. The strange conversation between the two somewhat matched her observations about everyone.</t872> <t873>With Miss Bingley's compliments on his beautiful handwriting or the evenness of his lines, and the way he accepted her compliments with absolute indifference.</t873>
<t874>- Miss Darcy will surely be very pleased to receive your letter.</t874>
<t875>Darcy did not reply.</t875>
<t876>- You write unusually fast.</t876>
<t877>- You are mistaken, I write quite slowly.</t877>
<t878>- How many letters do you have the opportunity to write in a year!</t878> <t879>Including business letters.</t879> <t880>I hate such correspondence.</t880>
<t881>- Then it is fortunate that those letters are tied to my fate instead of yours.</t881>
<t882>- Please kindly tell her that I am very eager to see her again.</t882>
<t883>- I already sent a message once according to your request.</t883>
<t884>- I'm afraid you don't like that pen.</t884> <t885>Let me fix it for you.</t885> <t886>I'm quite good at fixing pens.</t886>
<t887>- Thank you, but I always treat myself.</t887>
<t888>- How did you come up with the way to write in such straight lines?</t888>
<t889>Darcy was silent.</t889>
<t890>- Please tell your sister that I am pleased to hear she has made much progress with her music.</t890> <t891>Also let her know that I am very impressed with her small design for the table, and I think it is clearly better than Miss Grantley's.</t891>
<t892>- Can I postpone my infatuation with you until the next letter?</t892> <t893>Right now, I don't have enough paper to write.</t893>
<t894>- Ah! It's okay.</t894> <t895>I will meet her in January.</t895> <t896>But do you often write such long and captivating letters, Mr. Darcy?</t896>
<t897>- Usually, the letters I write are long, but whether they are captivating or not, I do not know.</t897>
<t898>- I realized the rule that if a person writes a long letter easily, the content is always very engaging.</t898>
<t899>Bingley exclaimed:</t899>
<t900>- Caroline, that's not the way to praise Darcy, because he doesn't write letters easily.</t900> <t901>He has learned quite a few vulgar words, hasn't he, my friend?</t901>
<t902>- My writing style is completely different from yours.</t902>
<t903>- Ah! Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable.</t903> <t904>He leaves out half the words and smudges the rest. – Miss Bingley added.</t904>
<t905>- My ideas flow out so quickly that I don't have time to present them.</t905> <t906>In that manner, my letters often fail to convey what I want to the recipient.</t906>
<t907>Elizabeth said:</t907>
<t908>- Mr. Bingley, your modesty makes it impossible for anyone to criticize you.</t908>
<t909>- There is nothing more deceitful than the appearance of humility.</t909> <t910>Often it is carelessness in expressing opinions, sometimes it is even a way of indirect boasting. –</t910> <t911>Darcy said.</t911>
<t912>- And what category do you think my little humility just now falls into?</t912>
<t913>- That is a way of indirect boasting, because in fact, he is proud of his shortcomings when writing letters, as he sees these shortcomings as a result of quick thinking and clumsy presentation, he thinks at least that is an interesting point.</t913> <t914>Teachers often value the ability to do things quickly and usually do not pay attention to perfectionism.</t914> <t915>When he told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if he decided to leave Netherfield he would go within five minutes, that was a way of self-praise.</t915> <t916>However, what is praiseworthy about the hastiness that leaves all necessary work unfinished and benefits neither oneself nor anyone else?</t916>
<t917>- No way! That's just too much.</t917> <t918>Remembering the foolish things said in the morning during the evening is truly unbearable.</t918> <t919>However, I can confirm with honor that I believe the things I said about myself are true; at that time, I believed so.</t919> <t920>Therefore, I have no intention of acting hastily just to show off to the girls.</t920>
<t921>- I know you believe in what you say, but I am also not convinced that you would leave in such a hurry, and if you are mounting your horse, a friend just needs to say “Bingley, you should stay another week,” and you might not go, and with further persuasion, you might stay a few more months.</t921>
<t922>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t922>
<t923>- By that, you only demonstrate that Mr. Bingley is not fair to his own temperament.</t923> <t924>You only show off for him more than he shows off himself.</t924>
<t925>- I am very grateful that you turned my friend's words into a compliment about my gentle demeanor.</t925> <t926>But I fear that you have steered the issue in a different direction that my friend here might not necessarily follow, because he will surely think well of me again.</t926> <t927>If in such a case, I would straightforwardly refuse and leave as quickly as possible. – Bingley smiled and said to Elizabeth.</t927>
<t928>- Does Mr. Darcy consider the flaw of hastiness in his intentions to be rectifiable when he insists on maintaining his intentions?</t928>
<t929>- I can't explain this issue exactly, Darcy himself has to say it.</t929>
<t930>Darcy spoke up:</t930>
<t931>- You want me to explain the opinion that you call my opinion, while I still haven't realized that it is my own.</t931> <t932>However, according to your presentation, dear Miss Bennet, you should remember that this friend only wants him to delay his plans, they only wish for that and do not intend to argue about the propriety of the behavior.</t932>
<t933>- Ready to compromise – to compromise easily – the persuasion of a friend seems to hold no value for him.</t933>
<t934>- Conceding without having firm inner belief is not a commendation of understanding or trust in concession.</t934>
<t935>- In my opinion, Mr. Darcy does not trust in the influence of friendship or affection.</t935> <t936>When we truly care for someone who asks us for something, we tend to comply without needing an explanation for the request.</t936> <t937>Perhaps we should wait until the situation actually arises before we discuss how he would behave.</t937> <t938>But generally, in ordinary circumstances between friends, when one wishes the other to change their mind, do you think ill of the person who goes along with their friend's wish without waiting for an explanation?</t938> <t939>Before we discuss, shouldn't we clarify the importance of the request and the level of closeness between the two people?</t939>
<t940>- Miss Bennet, indeed it is so, let us listen to every detail, do not forget the importance of the details, because through them the argument can be more weighty.</t940> <t941>I assure you that if Darcy were not taller than I am, my esteem for him would be less than half.</t941> <t942>I have never known anyone more imposing than Darcy, in certain circumstances and certain places, especially at his home, on Saturday evenings when he has nothing to do.</t942>
<t943>Darcy smiled, but Elizabeth could sense that he was quite offended, so she tried to stifle her laughter.</t943> <t944>Miss Bingley, upset by the insult he received, pointed out the wrongness of her brother's nonsensical talk.</t944>
<t945>Your friend said:</t945>
<t946>- I recognize your intention, Bingley.</t946> <t947>You hate arguing, so you want to quash it.</t947>
<t948>- It could be so, arguing as well as debating.</t948> <t949>If you and Miss Bennet could postpone your debate until I leave the room, I would be very grateful, and then you can say whatever you want about me.</t949>
<t950>- For me, it's nothing.</t950> <t951>As for Mr. Darcy, he should finish writing his letter.</t951>
<t952>Darcy followed her advice, and he completed the letter.</t952>
<t953>After finishing his work, he asked Miss Bingley and Elizabeth to indulge him by playing a few pieces of music.</t953> <t954>Miss Bingley eagerly went to the piano, politely asking Elizabeth to perform first, and she also politely and earnestly declined, so Bingley began to sit down and play.</t954>
<t955>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while Elizabeth was turning over the music books placed on the piano, she couldn't help but notice that Darcy's eyes occasionally fixed on her.</t955> <t956>She did not dare to think that she could be the object of affection for someone of his high social standing.</t956> <t957>Yet, the idea that he looked at her out of dislike seemed even stranger.</t957> <t958>In the end, she could only think that she attracted his attention because, in his view, she had something more wrong or blameworthy than the others in the room, according to his ideas of conduct.</t958> <t959>This thought did not offend her.</t959> <t960>She did not like him much, so she did not care whether he accepted her or not.</t960>
<t961>After playing a few Italian pieces, Miss Bingley changed the enchantment with a lively Scottish tune.</t961> <t962>Shortly thereafter, Darcy approached her and said:</t962>
<t963>- Miss Bennet, do you feel like taking this opportunity to dance a piece?</t963>
<t964>She smiled but did not respond.</t964> <t965>He repeated the question, with a bit of surprise at her silence.</t965>
<t966>- Ah, I have heard you, but I don't yet know how to respond immediately.</t966> <t967>I know you want me to agree so you can look down on my recreational pleasures, but I take great pleasure in thwarting such schemes and countering the schemer.</t967> <t968>Therefore, I decided to tell you that I do not like dancing.</t968> <t969>And now you can despise me, if you dare.</t969>
<t970>- Actually, I do not dare to underestimate you.</t970>
<t971>Elizabeth actually intended to confront him, but she was surprised to see him act so generously. Her personality was a blend of sweetness and humor, making it difficult for her to confront anyone.</t971> <t972>And Darcy felt that he had never been so captivated by a woman like her. He truly thought that if it weren't for her low status, he would be in a dangerous situation.</t972>
<t973>Miss Bingley had seen enough, or had enough suspicion to become jealous.</t973> <t974>She had been impatient for Jane to recover, and now she was even more eager to get rid of Elizabeth.</t974> <t975>She often tried to provoke Darcy to look down on the guests by talking about an imaginary wedding or planning for his happiness in a family connection.</t975>
<t976>When walking with him in the garden the next day, she said:</t976>
<t977>- When this highly anticipated event occurs, I hope that you will give your mother-in-law some hints to make her understand that she should keep her mouth shut. If possible, you should also correct your sisters-in-law who always follow the officers around.</t977> <t978>And, if I may address a very delicate matter, you should control that small, almost arrogant and insolent trait of your wife.</t978>
<t979>- Do you have any other suggestions for my family's happiness?</t979>
<t980>- Ah! Yes. You should hang the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips along the hallway of the Pemberly estate's living room.</t980> <t981>Place it near your uncle's portrait, who used to be a judge.</t981> <t982>Both of them worked in the same field, only differing in their professions.</t982> <t983>As for Elizabeth's portrait, you shouldn't worry, because no artist can truly capture the beauty of her eyes.</t983>
<t984>- That's right, it's not easy to capture what is expressed through the eyes, but colors and shapes can still be drawn.</t984>
<t985>At that moment, they encountered Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth, who were also out for a walk.</t985> <t986>Miss Bingley seemed uneasy, fearing that her recent remarks had been overheard.</t986>
<t987>- I didn't know you two were also taking a walk.</t987>
<t988>Mrs. Hurst said:</t988>
<t989>- You two are so sneaky, slipping out without letting us know.</t989>
<t990>Then she took hold of Darcy's free arm, and she walked away, leaving Elizabeth alone.</t990> <t991>The path was only wide enough for three people.</t991> <t992>Darcy, realizing their rudeness, turned back and said:</t992>
<t993>- This road is too narrow for our group.</t993> <t994>We should take the main road.</t994>
<t995>But Elizabeth did not want to join the crowd, she smiled and replied:</t995>
<t996>- No, no, you three go ahead.</t996> <t997>A group like that looks nice already.</t997> <t998>Adding a fourth person would ruin the scenery.</t998> <t999>I'll pass.</t999>
<t1000>Then she skipped away, her heart light and carefree, hoping that she could return home in a few days.</t1000> <t1001>Jane had improved a lot, so she wanted to leave the bedroom that night.</t1001>
<t1002>Chapter 11</t1002>
<t1003>After dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister's room, prepared a warm coat for her, and brought her to the living room.</t1003> <t1004>The two hostesses welcomed them with expressions of joy.</t1004> <t1005>In the hour before the gentlemen appeared, Elizabeth found the two women to be more pleasant than ever.</t1005> <t1006>Their conversational skills were truly excellent.</t1006> <t1007>They could accurately describe a party, humorously recount a story, and comfortably joke with their friends.</t1007>
<t1008>But when the gentlemen appeared, Jane was no longer the important subject.</t1008> <t1009>Miss Bingley's eyes immediately turned to Darcy, saying something to him before he stepped forward.</t1009> <t1010>He greeted Jane with congratulations on her health.</t1010> <t1011>Mr. Hurst also slightly bowed to her and said he was "very pleased."</t1011> <t1012>But only Bingley was somewhat verbose and warm, expressing joy and care for her.</t1012> <t1013>For half an hour, they lit the fire and kept the fireplace hot for fear that Jane might be cold.</t1013> <t1014>Bingley suggested she sit by the fireplace and then sat down near her, not conversing much with others.</t1014> <t1015>Elizabeth sat in the opposite corner of the room, looking at the scene with delight.</t1015>
<t1016>When they had finished their tea, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister about the card game, but no one was interested.</t1016> <t1017>She had guessed that Darcy did not like playing cards, so she refused Mr. Hurst.</t1017> <t1018>She explained to him that no one wanted to play cards, and their silence seemed to confirm her words.</t1018> <t1019>Therefore, with nothing else to do, Mr. Hurst had to lie down on the sofa and sleep.</t1019> <t1020>Darcy took out a book to read, Miss Bingley did the same, while Mrs. Hurst busied herself with her bracelets and rings, occasionally joining in the conversation with Jane.</t1020>
<t1021>Miss Bingley both noticed Darcy engrossed in his book and read her own, occasionally asking a question or glancing at his pages.</t1021> <t1022>However, she could not engage him in conversation; he only answered her questions briefly and then continued reading intently.</t1022> <t1023>Eventually, she lost interest in her book, having chosen it merely because it was the second volume of the one he was reading.</t1023> <t1024>She yawned and said:</t1024>
<t1025>- Experiencing an evening like this is truly delightful! I can say there's nothing more enjoyable than reading books.</t1025> <t1026>One can get bored with everything else, but never with books!</t1026> <t1027>When I have my own house, I will be miserable without a rich bookshelf.</t1027>
<t1028>No one answered, she yawned again, threw the book aside, and glanced around the room looking for something more entertaining.</t1028> <t1029>When she heard her brother mention a ball for Jane, she turned to him:</t1029>
<t1030>- Charles, by the way, do you really intend to organize the ball at Netherfield?</t1030> <t1031>Before you proceed, I advise you to seek the opinions of those around here.</t1031> <t1032>I might be mistaken, but I guess there are some among us who think of the ball as a torment rather than a pleasure.</t1032>
<t1033>- If you mean Darcy, if he wants, he can go to bed before the ball starts.</t1033> <t1034>The ball has been decided.</t1034>
<t1035>- I would prefer the ball to be organized differently.</t1035> <t1036>Usually, in gatherings like this, there is something unbearably dull.</t1036> <t1037>Creating opportunities to converse with each other is better than dancing.</t1037>
<t1038>- Caroline, it's much better, you could say that, but then it wouldn't be a ball anymore.</t1038>
<t1039>Miss Bingley did not reply; after a moment, she stood up and walked around the room.</t1039> <t1040>Her figure was truly splendid and her movements were graceful, all aimed at Darcy, but he remained engrossed in his book.</t1040> <t1041>In desperation, she tried another tactic.</t1041> <t1042>Turning to Elizabeth, she said:</t1042>
<t1043>- Miss Lizzy, I want to persuade you to follow me, walk around the room.</t1043> <t1044>I assure you it will be quite pleasant after sitting in one place for so long.</t1044>
<t1045>Elizabeth was surprised, but she agreed to follow along.</t1045> <t1046>Miss Bingley had succeeded with her target.</t1046> <t1047>Darcy looked up.</t1047> <t1048>Like Elizabeth, he was startled by being drawn into this new method of attracting attention.</t1048> <t1049>He was invited to join but declined.</t1049> <t1050>He stated that he believed there were two motives for walking back and forth in the room together and that if he joined, he would hinder one of those motives.</t1050> <t1051>“What do you mean?” Miss Bingley was very eager to know what he was thinking – and asked Elizabeth if she understood what he meant.</t1051>
<t1052>She replied:</t1052>
<t1053>- I don't understand anything.</t1053> <t1054>But through that, he has a strict attitude towards us, so the best way to disappoint him is to say nothing at all.</t1054>
<t1055>However, Miss Bingley did not want to disappoint him in any way, so she insisted on asking him to explain the two motives he had thought of.</t1055>
<t1056>He spoke, after she allowed him to speak:</t1056>
<t1057>- I have no intention of hiding anything by not explaining.</t1057> <t1058>Either you two chose this way because you are close to each other and have secret matters to discuss, or you know that your appearance becomes most beautiful when you move.</t1058> <t1059>With the first motivation, I do not want to intrude on your private matters; with the second motivation, I can admire you both better when I sit by the fireplace.</t1059>
<t1060>- Hey! You have shocked me! I have never heard anything so peculiar.</t1060> <t1061>How can we punish you for this statement? – Miss Bingley exclaimed.</t1061>
<t1062>- It's not easy if you just want to punish him.</t1062> <t1063>We can all irritate or punish each other.</t1063> <t1064>You should tease him, laugh at him; you are close to him, so you should know this well.</t1064>
<t1065>- On my honor, I must say I do not know.</t1065> <t1066>Please believe that my closeness does not teach me to do such a thing.</t1066> <t1067>Teasing a calm temperament and wit?</t1067> <t1068>No, no, I think he might challenge us on this point.</t1068> <t1069>As for jesting, we should not expose ourselves by jesting without a subject.</t1069> <t1070>Mr. Darcy can praise himself.</t1070>
<t1071>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t1071>
<t1072>- You shouldn't mock Mr. Darcy! It's a rare advantage, and I hope it remains rare, because I would be at a great disadvantage if there were many such relationships.</t1072> <t1073>I really enjoy joking.</t1073> <t1074>He said:</t1074>
<t1075>- Miss Bingley has elevated my reputation too high.</t1075> <t1076>The cleverest and the best of men, or rather the cleverest and the best of men's actions, can become ridiculous by someone who has spent their whole life first and foremost in jest.</t1076>
<t1077>Elizabeth replied:</t1077>
<t1078>- That's right, there are people like that, but I hope I'm not one of them.</t1078> <t1079>I hope I'm not too frivolous.</t1079> <t1080>All the madness, impulsiveness, and inconsistency amuse me, I must admit, so I laugh at these things whenever I can.</t1080> <t1081>But I don't think you have that trait.</t1081>
<t1082>- Maybe no one has.</t1082> <t1083>But I have learned to avoid the flaws that often manifest as notions that make others mock.</t1083>
<t1084>- Flaws such as frivolity and pride.</t1084>
<t1085>- Yes, frivolity is indeed a flaw.</t1085> <t1086>But pride – when one has a better mind than others, pride is always measured.</t1086>
<t1087>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.</t1087>
<t1088>Miss Bingley interjected:</t1088>
<t1089>- I think you have finished considering Mr. Darcy.</t1089> <t1090>Could you please tell me the result?</t1090>
<t1091>- According to Mr. Darcy, I am fully convinced that he has no flaws.</t1091> <t1092>He has admitted it himself without any concealment.</t1092>
<t1093>Darcy retorted:</t1093>
<t1094>- No, I did not mean to boast like that.</t1094> <t1095>I have many flaws, but I hope these flaws are not due to my understanding.</t1095> <t1096>Regarding my temperament, I do not dare to flatter myself.</t1096> <t1097>I think my nature is not easily submissive - certainly not agreeable with others.</t1097> <t1098>I cannot quickly forget the bad habits of others, or the offenses they commit against me.</t1098> <t1099>My mind is not easily swayed.</t1099> <t1100>Perhaps it should be said that I am easily displeased.</t1100> <t1101>Once my good opinion is lost, it is considered irretrievable.</t1101>
<t1102>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t1102>
<t1103>- That is a flaw!</t1103> <t1104>The habit of being displeased that cannot be soothed is indeed a part of one's temperament. But you have chosen your flaw correctly – I truly cannot jest.</t1104> <t1105>You are safe with me.</t1105>
<t1106>- I think everyone has some flaw, a natural flaw that even the best education cannot erase.</t1106>
<t1107>- And your flaw is the tendency to hate everyone.</t1107>
<t1108>- And her flaw is intentionally misunderstanding them.</t1108>
<t1109>Too bored with the conversation that she couldn't participate in, Miss Bingley dejectedly exclaimed:</t1109>
<t1110>- Play some music for a while.</t1110> <t1111>Louisa, allow me to wake up Mr. Hurst.</t1111>
<t1112>The elder sister did not object, the piano was opened again, and Darcy, after a few moments of thought, began to regret this.</t1112> <t1113>He began to feel the danger of having paid too much attention to Elizabeth.</t1113>
<t1114>Chapter 12</t1114>
<t1115>After the two sisters reached an agreement, Elizabeth wrote a letter to her mother requesting that a carriage be sent to bring them home.</t1115> <t1116>But Mrs. Bennet had planned for Jane to stay at Netherfield until Tuesday, exactly one week after Jane fell ill, so she was not pleased to hear this news.</t1116> <t1117>Therefore, her response did not align with Elizabeth's wishes.</t1117> <t1118>Mrs. Bennet stated that she could not send the carriage before Tuesday, and added that if Bingley and his sisters insisted, they could stay even longer.</t1118> <t1119>However, Elizabeth was determined not to stay any longer; she did not wish to accept their insistence.</t1119> <t1120>On the contrary, she was concerned that people might think she had intruded on their private lives for too long, so she urged Jane to ask to borrow Mrs. Hurst's carriage.</t1120> <t1121>Finally, the two sisters informed their hosts of their intention to leave Netherfield that morning and asked to borrow the carriage.</t1121>
<t1122>Everyone expressed a desire for them to leave the next day so that Jane could have more time to rest.</t1122> <t1123>The two sisters agreed.</t1123> <t1124>And Miss Bingley regretted having made the suggestion to postpone the date, as her jealousy towards Lizzy overshadowed her sympathy for Jane.</t1124>
<t1125>Mr. Bingley was quite worried about letting the two leave too early, repeatedly persuading Miss Bingley that it was not safe for Jane—that she had not fully recovered.</t1125> <t1126>But Jane was determined when she believed she was right.</t1126>
<t1127>For Darcy, this was rather good news –</t1127> <t1128>Elizabeth had stayed too long.</t1128> <t1129>And she attracted him more than he wanted, while Miss Bingley had been impolite to her and teased him more than usual.</t1129> <t1130>He had wisely resolved that he would not show any signs of affection towards her, and would not create any situation that might lead her to hope she could influence his happiness.</t1130> <t1131>Feeling that if this idea were to be revealed, his actions on the last day should be strong enough to either confirm or dispel it.</t1131> <t1132>Having decided to pursue his goal, he exchanged only a few words with her throughout Saturday.</t1132> <t1133>Even though there were times when they were alone together for half an hour, he focused on reading and did not look at her.</t1133>
<t1134>On Sunday, they said goodbye to each other, almost everyone had joy in their hearts.</t1134> <t1135>Miss Bingley quickly treated Elizabeth politely and showed affection towards Jane.</t1135> <t1136>She expressed a desire to see Jane again at Longbourn or Netherfield, then gently hugged Jane and shook hands with Elizabeth.</t1136> <t1137>As for Elizabeth, she felt the most uplifted in spirit.</t1137>
<t1138>Mrs. Bennet did not warmly welcome her two daughters.</t1138> <t1139>She was puzzled to see them return, thinking they had made a wrong decision and believing that it would cause Jane to fall ill again.</t1139> <t1140>But their father, although he only briefly expressed his joy, was genuinely delighted to see them again.</t1140> <t1141>He felt that the two daughters truly played a very important role in the family.</t1141> <t1142>In their absence, dinner conversations were much less lively and almost devoid of emotion.</t1142>
<t1143>They noticed that Mary, as usual, was immersing herself in understanding human nature with some old-fashioned moral comments that she wanted everyone to hear.</t1143> <t1144>Catherine and Lydia had information on a different matter; since the previous Wednesday, many things had happened with the regiment, some officers had dined with their uncle, a private had been punished, and there was news that Colonel Foster was going to get married.</t1144>
<t1145>Chapter 13</t1145>
<t1146>When the whole family was having breakfast together, Mr. Bennet said to his wife:</t1146>
<t1147>- I hope you will prepare a delicious dinner tonight, as we will have guests visiting.</t1147>
<t1148>- What do you mean? I haven't heard anyone will come, except for Charlotte Lucas who might unexpectedly visit.</t1148> <t1149>But I hope our family's food is good enough to entertain her, I don't think she often gets to enjoy such dishes at home.</t1149>
<t1150>- The person I want to talk about is a strange man.</t1150>
<t1151>Mrs. Bennet's eyes lit up:</t1151>
<t1152>- A strange man?</t1152> <t1153>I believe you are referring to Mr. Bingley.</t1153> <t1154>Why, Jane?</t1154> <t1155>You never tell me anything! I would certainly be very happy to see him again.</t1155> <t1156>But, oh dear, what bad luck.</t1156> <t1157>There's no fish left today! Lydia, ring the bell.</t1157> <t1158>I need to see Hill right now.</t1158>
<t1159>The husband said:</t1159>
<t1160>- It is not Mr. Bingley.</t1160> <t1161>This is someone whom I have never met in my life.</t1161>
<t1162>He made everyone extremely surprised, and seemed delighted to see his wife and five daughters anxiously asking about this man.</t1162> <t1163>After amusing himself for a while with his family's curiosity, he calmly explained:</t1163>
<t1164>- About a month ago, I received this letter, and two weeks ago I replied, because I thought this was a delicate matter, so I needed to pay attention from the beginning.</t1164> <t1165>This is a letter from Mr. Collins, who, after I die, can evict everyone from this house if he wants to.</t1165>
<t1166>The wife exclaimed in horror:</t1166>
<t1167>- Oh! I can't bear to hear about this.</t1167> <t1168>Please don't say anything about that disgusting fellow.</t1168> <t1169>I think this is the most absurd thing in the world, your property being torn away from our children, and if I were you, I would have done something about it a long time ago.</t1169>
<t1170>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the order of inheritance.</t1170> <t1171>The two had tried to explain many times before, but this was beyond her comprehension.</t1171> <t1172>She continued to rail against the cruelty of taking away the property of a family with five daughters to give it to a man who no one cared about.</t1172>
<t1173>Mr. Bennet admitted:</t1173>
<t1174>- This is truly an unreasonable issue, nothing can erase Mr. Collins' guilt in inheriting Longbourn.</t1174> <t1175>But if you are willing to listen to me read this letter, you might feel relieved by the way he expresses himself.</t1175>
<t1176>- No, I will not feel relieved at all.</t1176> <t1177>I think he is really insolent to dare to write a letter to you, and hypocritical as well.</t1177> <t1178>I absolutely hate such deceitful people. Why doesn't he continue the dispute with you like his father did before?</t1178>
<t1179>- Oh right, why does he seem to have some hesitation about familial relationships, as you will hear below:</t1179>
<t1180>"Huntsford, Westerham, Kent"</t1180>
<t1181>October 15</t1181>
<t1182>Dear Uncle</t1182>
<t1183>The long-standing discord between you and my esteemed father has always made me feel uneasy, so since my father's unfortunate passing, I have often wanted to mend this rift.</t1183> <t1184>However, for a time I thought it would be disrespectful to my father's memory if I were to have a conciliatory relationship with anyone who had been in conflict with him.</t1184> <t1185>Nevertheless, I have now made a decision on this matter because, after being ordained last Easter, I was particularly fortunate to be appointed by the council of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, with generosity and kindness, to the precious position of vicar of this parish.</t1185> <t1186>Here, I will strive with all my might to act with grateful reverence towards the Lady and be ready to perform the rites of the Church.</t1186> <t1187>Furthermore, in my capacity as a clergyman, I feel it is my duty to promote and establish the grace of peace to all families within my sphere of influence.</t1187> <t1188>On this basis, I believe that opening my heart is very appropriate, and given my position as the heir apparent to the estate at Longbourn, which will be overlooked by the family, I hope you will not refuse my olive branch.</t1188>
<t1189>I cannot be at ease because I have hurt the dear ladies of the house, and I also wish to apologize for this, as well as to ask you to understand that I am willing to reconcile with them – but I will mention this matter later.</t1189> <t1190>If you do not mind welcoming me into your home, I would like to visit the family on Monday, November 10th, at 4 PM.</t1190> <t1191>I will impose on the family's hospitality until the following Saturday, and there will be no hindrance to work, as Lady Catherine is willing to allow me to be absent on Sunday, provided another clergyman takes over the duties.</t1191>
<t1192>With goodwill and affection, I respectfully send my regards to your wife and the ladies.</t1192>
<t1193>William Collins</t1193>
<t1194>Mr. Bennet said, as he folded the letter:</t1194>
<t1195>- So, at 4 o'clock, we will welcome this peace envoy.</t1195> <t1196>It seems that he is a conscientious and courteous person, so I think this will be a good relationship, especially if the Lady allows him to visit again.</t1196>
<t1197>- There is some meaning when he talks about the girls, and if he is willing to make peace like that, then I will not stop him.</t1197>
<t1198>Jane joined:</t1198>
<t1199>- Although it is difficult to predict how he will make amends, he earned good points for expressing his intentions.</t1199>
<t1200>Elizabeth was particularly impressed with his exceptional respect for Lady Catherine, and the good ideas in the rituals of baptism, weddings, and burials for parishioners whenever requested.</t1200> <t1201>She said:</t1201>
<t1202>- I think he seems strange.</t1202> <t1203>I can't figure out what kind of person he is.</t1203> <t1204>He seems somewhat ostentatious, and what did he mean by apologizing for being the heir by order?</t1204> <t1205>I can't expect him to help, even if he could.</t1205> <t1206>Is he a reasonable person, father?</t1206>
<t1207>- I don't think so.</t1207> <t1208>I very much hope to meet someone who contradicts my thoughts.</t1208> <t1209>His letter seems both humble and arrogant, which says something.</t1209> <t1210>I am very eager to meet him.</t1210>
<t1211>Mary commented:</t1211>
<t1212>- Regarding the writing style, the letter has no flaws.</t1212> <t1213>The idea of the olive branch is not new, but I think he expressed it well.</t1213>
<t1214>For Lydia and Catherine, neither the letter nor the letter writer was of any interest.</t1214> <t1215>Their cousin could not come in a red coat, and the period during which they were interested in people wearing other colors had passed several weeks ago.</t1215> <t1216>As for their mother, the letter had somewhat alleviated her aversion; she prepared to meet him with a calmness that surprised both her husband and her daughters.</t1216>
<t1217>Mr. Collins arrived on time as promised and was received very politely by the whole family.</t1217> <t1218>Mr. Bennet spoke very little, but the daughters were always ready to converse; as for Mr. Collins, he neither needed encouragement to speak nor restraint to remain silent.</t1218> <t1219>He was quite tall and rather heavyset at the age of twenty-five.</t1219> <t1220>His demeanor was serious and formal, complemented by a very proper attitude.</t1220> <t1221>Soon after sitting down, he praised Mrs. Bennet for having such a wonderful family with five daughters, and said that he had heard much about them, but in this case, the reputation fell far short of the reality.</t1221> <t1222>He added that he was certain that before long, all the daughters would be happily settled.</t1222> <t1223>Some of the girls did not much like this flattery, but Mrs. Bennet, who enjoyed arguing but lacked for compliments, responded immediately:</t1223>
<t1224>- You are truly kind, with all my heart I hope that it will come true, otherwise their fate will be very miserable.</t1224> <t1225>Life often creates many strange circumstances.</t1225>
<t1226>- Maybe she was referring to inheritance by order.</t1226>
<t1227>- Ah! That's right!</t1227> <t1228>That is the matter that causes me to worry, I have to say so.</t1228> <t1229>I do not mean to imply that you are at fault, because I know that such things are merely by chance.</t1229> <t1230>We cannot know where our fortune will go when it is inherited in order.</t1230>
<t1231>- Madam, I deeply sympathize with the situation of your cousins and could say much more about this, only because I do not want to appear too eager and rash.</t1231> <t1232>But I can say that you can rest assured, I always care for them with a loving heart.</t1232> <t1233>At the moment, I cannot say more, but when we get to know each other better…</t1233>
<t1234>He was interrupted by an invitation to dine, and the girls smiled at each other.</t1234> <t1235>The girls were not the only ones he fancied.</t1235> <t1236>He examined and praised the large living room, the dining room, and all the furnishings.</t1236> <t1237>His praise of the household items might have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but she was tormented by the thought that he was viewing everything as his future inheritance.</t1237> <t1238>He also lavishly praised the dinner and asked to know which lady had such excellent culinary skills.</t1238> <t1239>But Mrs. Bennet hastily corrected him, somewhat rudely, informing him that the family had their own cook and the girls had nothing to do with the kitchen.</t1239> <t1240>He apologized for offending her.</t1240> <t1241>She gently replied that she was not offended at all, but he continued to apologize for quite some time.</t1241>
<t1242>Chapter 14</t1242>
<t1243>Mr. Bennet spoke very little during the meal, but when all the servants had left the dining room, he thought it was time to talk to the guest.</t1243> <t1244>So he started with the topic he thought the young man excelled in, by remarking that he had been very fortunate to receive the patronage of the Lady, that Lady Catherine de Bourgh's interest in his work, along with her consideration in making his living arrangements more comfortable, was very unusual.</t1244> <t1245>Mr. Bennet could not have chosen a better topic for the young man.</t1245> <t1246>For Mr. Collins eloquently praised the Lady.</t1246> <t1247>And the topic elevated his solemn demeanor above the usual level, and with the most important appearance, he stated that he had never met anyone like her in the upper class – the kindness and condescension, as he had observed in Lady Catherine. She had been pleased to graciously review two of his sermons during her attendance.</t1247> <t1248>She had also twice invited him to dine at Rosings, and just the previous Saturday had invited him to fill in for a four-person card game in the evening.</t1248> <t1249>Many people he knew said that Lady Catherine was proud, but he saw nothing in her but affability.</t1249> <t1250>She always spoke to him as she would to any other upper-class person, she never hindered him from socializing with neighboring families, or when he left the parish to visit relatives.</t1250> <t1251>She even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as possible, provided he chose carefully, and had several times visited his humble abode, where she was absolutely pleased with all his arrangements, and she even gave him a few suggestions – a few shelves in the room upstairs.</t1251>
<t1252>Mrs. Bennet said:</t1252>
<t1253>- All these actions are proper and polite, so I am sure she is a very pleasant woman.</t1253> <t1254>The unfortunate thing is that there aren't many such ladies.</t1254> <t1255>Does she live near you?</t1255>
<t1256>- The garden outside my modest dwelling is separated from Lady Catherine's Rosings Park estate by only a road.</t1256>
<t1257>- I think you said she was a widow.</t1257> <t1258>Does she have any relatives?</t1258>
<t1259>- She has only one daughter, who is the heiress of Rosings and a vast fortune.</t1259>
<t1260>Mrs. Bennet exclaimed, shaking her head:</t1260>
<t1261>- Ah! So she is a wealthy person.</t1261> <t1262>So what kind of person is she?</t1262> <t1263>Does she look beautiful?</t1263>
<t1264>- Actually, she is the most graceful young woman I have ever met. Lady Catherine herself said that, in terms of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh surpasses the most beautiful girls, as she has the expressions of a young woman of noble lineage.</t1264> <t1265>Unfortunately, her physical condition is too weak, which has hindered her success in many areas; otherwise, she would not fail in any field.</t1265> <t1266>But she is entirely amiable to everyone, often humbling herself to drive past my modest abode.</t1266>
<t1267>- Has she been presented at court yet?</t1267> <t1268>I don't remember ever seeing her name among the women presented at the Court.</t1268>
<t1269>- The sad thing is that her health condition does not allow her to enter the city.</t1269> <t1270>I myself told Lady Catherine the other day that this situation deprives the court of a splendid beauty.</t1270> <t1271>Lady Catherine seemed very pleased with my remark, and you can imagine that I am very delighted at every opportunity to offer subtle compliments that are always accepted by women.</t1271> <t1272>More than once, I have remarked to Lady Catherine that her charming daughter seems born to become a duchess, and the title is elevated by her rather than merely providing her with status.</t1272> <t1273>These are the little things that please Lady Catherine, and it is the special care that I remind myself to show in response to the favor she has shown me.</t1273>
<t1274>Mr. Bennet said:</t1274>
<t1275>- Your observation is very accurate; you have pleased others through your delicate manner.</t1275> <t1276>By the way, may I ask whether those gestures stem from the unfolding events, or are they the result of prior study.</t1276>
<t1277>- Most of it is spontaneous according to the moment, although sometimes I do arrange small compliments depending on the situation. If possible, I always create the appearance of being unprepared.</t1277>
<t1278>But what Mr. Bennet had anticipated was satisfactorily answered.</t1278> <t1279>He was indeed as ridiculous as Mr. Bennet had thought; he listened to him tell stories with pleasure, maintaining a serious expression, and only seeking sympathy when he glanced over at Elizabeth.</t1279>
<t1280>At tea time, considering that the amount of amusement had been sufficient, Mr. Bennet cheerfully led the guest back into the drawing room, and after they had finished tea, he invited him to read to the ladies.</t1280> <t1281>Mr. Collins readily accepted, and a book was handed to him.</t1281> <t1282>But when he picked up the book, he apologized and said that he had never read novels –</t1282> <t1283>Kitty stared at him, while Lydia exclaimed in astonishment.</t1283> <t1284>Several other books were brought to him, and after some consideration, he chose Fordyce's Sermons; Lydia gaped as he opened the book, and before he could read in a solemn, monotonous tone, she interrupted:</t1284>
<t1285>- Mom, do you know, Mr. Phillips intends to fire Richard, and if that happens, the colonel will take him in.</t1285> <t1286>Aunt told me so. I will go to Meryton tomorrow to get more details, and also to ask when Danny will return from the city.</t1286>
<t1287>The two elder sisters demanded that she hold her tongue, but Mr. Collins, feeling deeply offended, put the book aside and began to speak:</t1287>
<t1288>- I often notice that young girls pay little attention to books with distinctive value, even though they are written specifically for them.</t1288> <t1289>I must say that I am very surprised, because I believe that this education is very necessary for them.</t1289> <t1290>But I do not want to bother the young ladies any further.</t1290>
<t1291>Then he turned to Mr. Bennet and suggested they play chess.</t1291> <t1292>Mr. Bennet agreed, thinking that he had acted wisely by letting the girls amuse themselves with their trivial pursuits.</t1292> <t1293>Mrs. Bennet and the older daughters apologized to him in the politest terms for Lydia's interruption.</t1293> <t1294>But Mr. Collins reassured them that he did not mind the girl's actions and that he would never feel annoyed by her behavior.</t1294> <t1295>Then he sat down with Mr. Bennet at the chess table and prepared for the game.</t1295>
<t1296>Chapter 15</t1296>
<t1297>Mr. Collins is an insensitive person, and neither education nor communication has helped to compensate for this deficiency.</t1297> <t1298>Most of his upbringing was under the tutelage of an uneducated and miserly father.</t1298> <t1299>Although he attended university, he only did the bare minimum and failed to form any useful relationships.</t1299> <t1300>The subjugation—imposed on him by his father—initially gave him a humble appearance, now neutralized by the conceit of a dull mind, an isolated life, and a sense of self-satisfaction from early and unexpected success.</t1300> <t1301>A stroke of luck introduced him to Lady Catherine De Bourgh when a preaching position became vacant.</t1301> <t1302>His respect for her title and the reverence he holds for her as his patron, combined with his high self-regard, the prestige of being a clergyman, and the rights of a parish rector, have all created in him a blend of pride and obsequiousness, of self-importance and humility.</t1302>
<t1303>Now with a spacious mansion and sufficient income, he intended to get married.</t1303> <t1304>When he planned to reconcile with the family at Longbourn, he aimed to marry one of the daughters, provided they were as beautiful and charming as he had heard.</t1304> <t1305>This was his plan for making amends – a way to atone – to inherit Mr. Bennet's estate.</t1305> <t1306>He thought this was a wonderful plan, that he was qualified and well-matched, coupled with boundless generosity, and without any self-interest on his part.</t1306>
<t1307>After meeting the ladies, his plan remained unchanged.</t1307> <t1308>Jane's beautiful face confirmed everyone's rumors and matched the strictest views regarding his status.</t1308> <t1309>On the first morning, Jane was his choice. However, the next morning there was an adjustment.</t1309> <t1310>While sitting and talking with Mrs. Bennet during breakfast, the conversation started from the parsonage and naturally led to a confession of his hopes that at Longbourn he might find someone who could be the mistress of his estate.</t1310> <t1311>Amidst kind smiles and encouragement were hints about Jane, whom he was interested in.</t1311> <t1312>But Mrs. Bennet had to mention that she might soon be engaged.</t1312>
<t1313>Mr. Collins simply needed to change from Jane to Elizabeth, and this happened quickly, while Mrs. Bennet was still busy suggesting that Elizabeth was nearly equal to Jane in age and beauty.</t1313>
<t1314>Mrs. Bennet paid great attention to this insinuation, and believed that soon her two daughters would be engaged.</t1314> <t1315>The young man whom she could not stand to hear about two days ago was now being treated by her as an honored guest.</t1315>
<t1316>Lydia did not forget her intention to go to Meryton; her sisters, except for Mary, all agreed to go with her, and Mr. Collins would accompany them to look after them at Mr. Bennet's request.</t1316> <t1317>He only wanted to get rid of the man so he could read in peace, because after breakfast Mr. Collins had been following him around, ostensibly examining the large volumes in the collection, but incessantly talking to him about his house and garden at Huntsford.</t1317> <t1318>This behavior made Mr. Bennet extremely uncomfortable.</t1318> <t1319>In the reading room, he was always assured of quiet.</t1319> <t1320>As he had told Elizabeth, although he had to face folly and conceit elsewhere, in the reading room he was usually free from such annoyances.</t1320> <t1321>Therefore, he politely invited Mr. Collins to accompany his daughters.</t1321> <t1322>Mr. Collins also preferred going with the ladies to reading, and was very happy to close the thick book and join them.</t1322>
<t1323>With trivial displays and polite compliments, he accompanied the ladies to Meryton.</t1323> <t1324>At this point, the ladies no longer paid attention to him.</t1324> <t1325>Their eyes roamed the streets in search of officers, and only the sight of truly elegant hats or muslin goods could distract them.</t1325>
<t1326>But a young man appeared and caught the ladies' attention.</t1326> <t1327>He had a truly elegant appearance, walking in the opposite direction of an officer.</t1327> <t1328>The officer was Danny, the one who had returned from London that Lydia had mentioned.</t1328> <t1329>He bowed his head to greet them as everyone passed by.</t1329> <t1330>All the ladies were impressed by his demeanor and wondered who he was.</t1330> <t1331>Kitty and Lydia decided to find out who he was.</t1331> <t1332>The two led the way, crossing the street under the pretext of buying something from the shop opposite, and luckily arrived at the curb just as the two young men were returning to the same place.</t1332> <t1333>Danny greeted them and asked permission to introduce his friend to the ladies, Mr. Wickham, who had returned from the city with him and was also joining the same unit.</t1333> <t1334>Just the uniform alone made the young man completely captivating.</t1334> <t1335>Every aspect of his appearance was splendid; he had a delicate face, a perfect physique, and, in addition, a very charming way of speaking.</t1335> <t1336>Right after the introduction, there was a cheerful and naturally fluent conversation that was very proper.</t1336> <t1337>They were all chatting when they heard the sound of approaching horses, and they saw Darcy and Bingley riding up.</t1337> <t1338>Upon seeing the ladies, the two men approached and began the usual polite exchanges.</t1338> <t1339>Bingley was the main speaker, and Jane the main listener.</t1339> <t1340>He said he was on his way to Longbourn to inquire about her condition.</t1340> <t1341>Darcy confirmed his friend's words with a slight nod, and as he began to resolutely avoid staring at Elizabeth, he noticed the unfamiliar young man.</t1341> <t1342>Elizabeth managed to see the expressions on both their faces as they looked at each other, very surprised by the impact of the encounter.</t1342> <t1343>Both changed their complexion, one turning white, the other red.</t1343> <t1344>After a few moments, Wickham touched his hat to greet, and Darcy only awkwardly responded.</t1344> <t1345>What was that?</t1345> <t1346>Impossible to think of, impossible not to want to know?</t1346>
<t1347>Meanwhile, Bingley seemed unaware of what had happened, bid farewell, and rode off with his friend.</t1347>
<t1348>Mr. Danny and Wickham accompanied the ladies to Mr. Phillips' house, then bowed and took their leave, despite Lydia's pleas for them to come inside.</t1348> <t1349>Mrs. Phillips was delighted to see her nieces again.</t1349> <t1350>The two older girls, having been away for some time, received a special welcome.</t1350> <t1351>She was surprised by their sudden return home.</t1351> <t1352>Since they did not use the carriage, she would not have known they had returned if she had not accidentally met the shopkeeper who sold goods to Mr. Jones and informed her.</t1352> <t1353>Jane introduced Mr. Collins to her, and she received him with utmost politeness.</t1353> <t1354>He responded formally, apologizing for the intrusion as they had not been acquainted before, only through the ladies' introduction.</t1354> <t1355>Mrs. Phillips seemed concerned about receiving someone with such excessive politeness.</t1355> <t1356>But the welcome was interrupted by inquiries about the stranger, and about him, she only knew what the ladies had already been told.</t1356> <t1357>She promised to have her husband visit him and invite him for a meal, provided the Bennet family would also come in the evening.</t1357> <t1358>Everyone agreed, and they all left in high spirits, anticipating the upcoming pleasures.</t1358> <t1359>Mr. Collins repeated his apologies, but she reassured him that it was unnecessary.</t1359>
<t1360>On the way back, Elizabeth told Jane about Darcy's strange attitude.</t1360> <t1361>Although Jane could defend both of them if they had done something wrong, she couldn't explain to her sister the attitude of the two.</t1361>
<t1362>Mr. Collins made Mrs. Bennet extremely grateful when he praised Mrs. Phillips' attitude and polite manners.</t1362> <t1363>He insisted that, except for Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never met a more elegant woman, for she not only received him with the highest courtesy but also kindly invited him to visit the next evening, despite not having known him before.</t1363> <t1364>He could guess that it was due to his connection with the Bennet family, yet he was still very pleased because he had never been so noticed in his life.</t1364>
<t1365>Chapter 16</t1365>
<t1366>Because no one objected to the girls gathering at their aunt's house, everyone opposed Mr. Collins' hesitation to leave Mr. and Mrs. Bennet during the visit, the carriage took him and his five cousins to Meryton.</t1366> <t1367>When they entered the living room, the girls were delighted to learn that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation and was currently in the house.</t1367>
<t1368>When everyone had taken their seats, Mr. Collins gazed around absentmindedly and admired the surroundings, as he was quite impressed with the size and interior of the room, to the extent that he remarked he felt as if he were sitting in the summer dining room at Rosings.</t1368> <t1369>At first, the comparison did not bring joy, but when Mrs. Philips understood where Rosings was and who owned it, when she heard him describe one of Lady Catherine's drawing rooms and learned that just the fireplace had cost eight hundred pounds, she immediately felt the full force of the compliment, and it would not have been bothersome if he had intended to compare it to the housekeeper's room.</t1369>
<t1370>Until the young men arrived to sit with them, while describing all the splendor of Lady Catherine and her estate, occasionally digressing to praise his own humble Parsonage and its improvements, Mr. Collins found Mrs. Philips to be an attentive listener in conversation.</t1370> <t1371>The more she listened, the higher her impression of his status grew, and she intended to recount everything to her neighbors as soon as possible.</t1371> <t1372>For the young ladies, unable to hear him speak and with nothing to do but wait, the waiting time seemed excessively long.</t1372> <t1373>Finally, the young men arrived.</t1373> <t1374>When Mr. Wickham entered, Elizabeth felt as if she had either never met him before or had not thought of him since then, with a fleeting, inexplicable fondness.</t1374> <t1375>The officers were all reputable, elegant, and the best of them were present here; but Mr. Wickham stood out above all in person, face, manner, and bearing, just as they surpassed Mr. Philips, with his broad face, who at that moment was exhaling the scent of port wine as he followed them into the room.</t1375>
<t1376>Mr. Wickham was the fortunate young man who caught the attention of almost all the ladies, while Elizabeth was the fortunate young woman who got to sit near him.</t1376> <t1377>His relaxed manner when he started a conversation, even if it was about a rainy night and with the potential of a rainy season, made her think that the most ordinary, boring, and old-fashioned topic could become interesting through a person with the gift of gab.</t1377>
<t1378>With rivals like Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink to a level of insignificance.</t1378> <t1379>To the young ladies, he was certainly nothing; but occasionally he had the polite Mrs. Philips to listen to him, and under her care, he was the guest most frequently invited for coffee and cake.</t1379>
<t1380>When the cards were laid out, he had the opportunity to respond to her invitation to join the whist game.</t1380> <t1381>He said:</t1381>
<t1382>- I don't know much about this way of playing, but I would be very happy to have the opportunity to learn more, given the circumstances of my life.</t1382>
<t1383>Mrs. Philips thanked him for indulging her, but could not wait to hear his reason.</t1383>
<t1384>Mr. Wickham did not play whist, but was pleased to sit between Elizabeth and Lydia at the other table.</t1384> <t1385>At first, there was a risk that Lydia would monopolize his time because she talked incessantly, but since she was very fond of playing lottery tickets, she focused more on the game and paid no attention to anyone else.</t1385> <t1386>Thus, Mr. Wickham leisurely conversed with Elizabeth.</t1386> <t1387>She was willing to listen to him, although the main thing she wanted to hear, which was the reason for his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy, he did not mention.</t1387> <t1388>She did not even dare to mention his name.</t1388> <t1389>But soon, her curiosity was satisfied, as Mr. Wickham began the topic.</t1389> <t1390>He asked her how far Netherfield was from Meryton, and after hearing the answer, with a slight hesitation, he asked how long Mr. Darcy had been there.</t1390> <t1391>She replied:</t1391>
<t1392>- About a month.</t1392>
<t1393>Then, not wanting the story to be left unfinished, she added:</t1393>
<t1394>- I have been informed that he has a large estate in Derbyshire.</t1394>
<t1395>Wickham replied:</t1395>
<t1396>- Yes, his real estate is quite substantial.</t1396> <t1397>Up to ten thousand a year.</t1397> <t1398>You won't find anyone who can provide as much information about him as I can, because I have had a special relationship with his family since I was a child.</t1398>
<t1399>Elizabeth could not hide her surprise.</t1399>
<t1400>- Elizabeth, you might be very surprised to hear me say this, after you must have noticed the cold attitude between the two of us when we met yesterday.</t1400> <t1401>Are you well acquainted with Mr. Darcy?</t1401>
<t1402>Elizabeth spoke harshly:</t1402>
<t1403>- Close enough to the extent that I desire.</t1403> <t1404>I spent four days under the same roof with him, and because of that, I think he is a really unpleasant person.</t1404>
<t1405>Wickham said:</t1405>
<t1406>- I do not have the right to give my opinion on whether he is pleasant or not.</t1406> <t1407>I am not qualified to give an opinion.</t1407> <t1408>I have known him for too long and too well to be impartial in judging him.</t1408> <t1409>I cannot remain unbiased.</t1409> <t1410>But I believe your opinion of him is surprisingly harsh – and perhaps elsewhere you would not speak so harshly.</t1410> <t1411>Here, you are with your family.</t1411>
<t1412>- I assure you that here I am not exaggerating what I can say in any other house in the area, except at Netherfield. No one in Hertfordshire loves him.</t1412> <t1413>You will not find anyone who speaks well of him.</t1413>
<t1414>Wickham said:</t1414>
<t1415>- I cannot pretend to regret that he or any other person should not be overestimated compared to their true worth, but with him, I believe this does not happen often.</t1415> <t1416>People are dazzled by his wealth and status, or intimidated by his elevated and dignified demeanor, so they see him the way he wants to be seen.</t1416>
<t1417>- Even though I don't know him well, I still consider him to be a person with a bad temper.</t1417>
<t1418>Wickham just shook his head.</t1418> <t1419>He said:</t1419>
<t1420>- I wonder how long he will stay here.</t1420>
<t1421>- I don't know anything, but when I was at Netherfield, I didn't hear anything about him leaving.</t1421> <t1422>I hope his presence around here won't affect your plans to join the unit here.</t1422>
<t1423>- Ah, no – it’s not that I will be shunned by Mr. Darcy.</t1423> <t1424>If he wants to avoid meeting me, he must leave.</t1424> <t1425>The two of us are not friends; I always feel uncomfortable when I see him, but I have no reason to avoid him except for what I can publicly declare: a sense of mistreatment, along with the sorrowful regret of seeing him in this situation. Miss Bennet, his father passed away, was one of the best men who ever lived on this earth, and also one of my most trusted confidants, so I cannot be close to this Mr. Darcy without my heart aching with a thousand tender memories.</t1425> <t1426>His attitude towards me is scandalous, but honestly, I believe that I can forgive him for everything, rather than let him disappoint all hopes and bring shame to his father's spirit.</t1426>
<t1427>Elizabeth felt more interested in the matter and listened with all her heart, but due to delicate reasons, she could not inquire further.</t1427>
<t1428>Mr. Wickham began to talk about more general topics, Meryton, the surrounding area, through social interactions, revealing his appreciation for what he had observed; and with a charming and gentle manner that was very easy to understand, he particularly spoke about social relations.</t1428> <t1429>He added:</t1429>
<t1430>- It was precisely because I thought of stable social relations and good relationships that I joined the militia.</t1430> <t1431>I know this is the most respectable, most pleasant force, and my friend Denny further encouraged me through the way he spoke about the residential area, along with the utmost care and wonderful relationships in Meryton.</t1431> <t1432>I confess that I desire social relationships.</t1432> <t1433>I have been disappointed before, and my temperament cannot endure loneliness.</t1433> <t1434>I must have work and relationships.</t1434> <t1435>Military life was not something I aimed for before, but circumstances now make me qualified.</t1435> <t1436>The church should have been my professional environment.</t1436> <t1437>I was raised for the church; by now I would have had the most valuable life, if the person I just mentioned had accepted,</t1437>
<t1438>- Really?</t1438>
<t1439>- Yes: Darcy's late father gave me the highest ecclesiastical income among what he left for me.</t1439> <t1440>He was my godfather, very attached to me.</t1440> <t1441>I didn't know how to repay his kindness.</t1441> <t1442>He intended to provide me with ample means of living and thought he had accomplished this, but when the income was reduced, I did not receive it.</t1442>
<t1443>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t1443>
<t1444>- Oh no! How could this happen?</t1444> <t1445>How could people not follow the will? Why didn't you seek legal intervention?</t1445>
<t1446>- There is one clause in the will that leaves me with no hope from the law.</t1446> <t1447>A man of honor cannot doubt the intention, but Mr. Darcy deliberately doubts, or considers it merely a conditional proposal, and asserts that I have forfeited all rights in it through reckless extravagance, something like that.</t1447> <t1448>What is certain is that the income was gone two years ago, at the time I came of age to benefit from it.</t1448> <t1449>This amount was assigned to someone else.</t1449> <t1450>It is also certain that I cannot convict myself of having actually done anything to deserve disinheritance.</t1450> <t1451>I have a hot temper, cannot restrain myself; perhaps I occasionally said something too loose about him, or to him.</t1451> <t1452>I do not remember doing anything worse.</t1452> <t1453>But the truth is, we belong to two very different types of people, and he hates me.</t1453>
<t1454>- It's terrible! He should have been publicly exposed.</t1454>
<t1455>- One day you will be exposed, but not by me.</t1455> <t1456>As long as I cannot forget your father, I cannot challenge or accuse you.</t1456>
<t1457>Elizabeth respected him for these thoughts, thinking he looked more handsome when he expressed them.</t1457>
<t1458>After a moment of silence, she said:</t1458>
<t1459>- But what is his motivation?</t1459> <t1460>What could make him act so ruthlessly?</t1460>
<t1461>- He hates me intensely, and I believe it is due to jealousy.</t1461> <t1462>If the old man loved me less, his son might have treated me better.</t1462> <t1463>But I believe that the unusual attachment between the old man and me made him angry from the very beginning.</t1463> <t1464>He did not have enough composure to accept the rivalry between the two of us, to accept the favoritism shown towards me.</t1464>
<t1465>- I did not think that Mr. Darcy could be so wicked; although I never liked him, I did not think too badly of him.</t1465> <t1466>I guessed that he just generally disliked others, but I did not expect him to stoop to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity!</t1466>
<t1467>After a few minutes of thinking, she continued:</t1467>
<t1468>- Actually, at Netherfield the other day, I remember hearing him boast about his unappeasable irritability and his unwillingness to forgive.</t1468> <t1469>His temperament is truly dreadful.</t1469>
<t1470>Wickham replied:</t1470>
<t1471>- I am not confident enough to talk about this.</t1471> <t1472>I find it difficult to be impartial in judging him.</t1472>
<t1473>Elizabeth sank deep into thought again, and after a moment she exclaimed:</t1473>
<t1474>- To treat someone in such a manner, the godson, the friend, the one favored by the father!</t1474>
<t1475>She could have added: "A young man, like you, with a face that could be called charming," but she only said:</t1475>
<t1476>- And perhaps also a close companion from his youth, the closest relationship, as he said.</t1476>
<t1477>- We were born in the same parish, in the same garden, living together for most of our childhood; we stayed in the same dormitory, shared the same pleasures, and were cared for by the same parents.</t1477> <t1478>My father started his life with the same profession as your uncle Philips, but he gave it all up to work for Mr. Darcy, dedicating all his time to taking care of the Pemberly estate.</t1478> <t1479>He was greatly respected by Mr. Darcy, and he was also the closest and most trustworthy person in his household.</t1479> <t1480>Mr. Darcy often acknowledged that he owed a deep debt of gratitude for my father's diligent care.</t1480> <t1481>Just before my father passed away, Mr. Darcy voluntarily promised him that it was both out of a sense of deep debt to him and affection for me.</t1481>
<t1482>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t1482>
<t1483>- How strange! How disgusting! I wonder if it was pride that made him treat you like that.</t1483> <t1484>If not for a greater motive, I think he wouldn't have been too proud to become dishonest – because I must call it dishonesty.</t1484>
<t1485>Wickham replied:</t1485>
<t1486>- That is wonderful, because almost all of his actions stem from pride, and pride is often his closest friend.</t1486> <t1487>It has connected him closer to virtue than any other feeling.</t1487> <t1488>But none of us are consistent; and in his attitude towards me, there are stronger motives than pride.</t1488>
<t1489>- Could it be that such disgusting pride has ever helped him do good work?</t1489>
<t1490>- Yes, of course. Pride often makes him generous and chivalrous – to freely distribute money, to demonstrate hospitality, to support tenants, to help the poor.</t1490> <t1491>Pride in his family, pride in filial piety drove these actions, because he is very proud of his father.</t1491> <t1492>Not revealing it in a way that would disgrace the family, such as degrading common values, or diminishing the influence of the Pemberley house, all these are strong motivations.</t1492> <t1493>He is also proud of his kinship which, with a certain brotherly love, has made him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister.</t1493> <t1494>You could hear people praising him as the most caring and best brother among his siblings.</t1494>
<t1495>- And what kind of person is Miss Darcy?</t1495>
<t1496>He shook his head:</t1496>
<t1497>-I wish I could say she was charming.</t1497> <t1498>I feel sad speaking ill of a member of the Darcy family.</t1498> <t1499>But she is just like her brother, proud, very proud.</t1499> <t1500>When she was a child, she was affectionate and pleasant, and she was very fond of me; I spent a lot of time playing with her.</t1500> <t1501>But now, to her, I am nothing.</t1501> <t1502>She is a pretty girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and as far as I know, she has quite a few talents.</t1502> <t1503>Since her father passed away, she has been living in London, with a lady who stays with her and acts as her governess.</t1503>
<t1504>After many moments of silence and several attempts to change the subject, Elizabeth couldn't help but return to the original topic.</t1504> <t1505>She said:</t1505>
<t1506>- I am surprised by the friendship between Darcy and Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems quite cheerful and genuinely friendly, as I believe, be friends with someone like Darcy? Do you know anything about Mr. Bingley?</t1506>
<t1507>- Absolutely not.</t1507>
<t1508>- He is a young man with a gentle, charming, and captivating personality.</t1508> <t1509>He cannot understand what kind of person Darcy is.</t1509>
<t1510>- It may be so, but Mr. Darcy can please others when he wants to.</t1510> <t1511>He is not very likely to.</t1511> <t1512>He can be a companion to socialize with if he thinks it benefits him.</t1512> <t1513>Among those of his own status, he becomes a completely different person compared to when he associates with those of lower status.</t1513> <t1514>He is always proud, but with the wealthy, he has a liberal, fair, honest, just, straightforward, and perhaps pleasant demeanor – this is in addition to his wealth and appearance.</t1514>
<t1515>The whist card game table then dispersed, and the card players gathered around another table, with Mr. Collins sitting between Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.</t1515> <t1516>He lost every point, but when Mrs. Philips expressed concern, he solemnly reassured her that it did not matter at all, that he regarded money as a trivial matter, and asked her not to worry.</t1516> <t1517>He said:</t1517>
<t1518>- Madam, I am well aware that when one sits down at a card table, they must accept the risks involved, and I am fortunate not to be in circumstances where I have to count every penny.</t1518> <t1519>Surely, many would disagree, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I do not have to worry about such trivial matters.</t1519>
<t1520>The remark caught Mr. Wickham's attention.</t1520> <t1521>After observing Mr. Collins for a while, he quietly asked Elizabeth about the relationship between Mr. Collins and the De Bourgh family. She replied:</t1521>
<t1522>- Lady Catherine de Bourgh recently provided him with an ecclesiastical income.</t1522> <t1523>I am not sure how he was first introduced to her, but he certainly hasn't known her for long.</t1523>
<t1524>- Surely you know that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy are sisters, so she is Mr. Darcy's aunt.</t1524>
<t1525>- Actually, I don't know.</t1525> <t1526>I don't know anything about Mrs. Catherine's relationships.</t1526> <t1527>I only heard about her the day before yesterday.</t1527>
<t1528>- Your daughter, Miss De Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin, Mr. Darcy, will unite the two estates.</t1528>
<t1529>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley.</t1529> <t1530>All of her attentions would be in vain; her feelings for his sister and her respect for him would also be futile and useless if he had already been designated for someone else.</t1530>
<t1531>Elizabeth said:</t1531>
<t1532>- Mr. Collins praised both Lady Catherine and her daughter, but from some details he mentioned about her, I think his appreciation has made him delusional.</t1532> <t1533>Although she is his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.</t1533>
<t1534>Wickham replied:</t1534>
<t1535>- I believe she possesses both flaws to a severe degree.</t1535> <t1536>For many years I did not see her, but I still remember very clearly that I never liked her; I also remember her domineering and arrogant attitude.</t1536> <t1537>She had a reputation for being reasonable and shrewd, but I believe her abilities were partly due to her status and wealth, partly from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who always wanted those associated with him to have the discernment of the upper class.</t1537>
<t1538>Elizabeth thought that he had analyzed it reasonably.</t1538> <t1539>The two continued to converse with each other harmoniously until the dinner ended the card game and allowed other women to pay attention to him.</t1539> <t1540>During the noisy meal, no one could talk much, but everyone admired his demeanor.</t1540> <t1541>Everything he said was reasonable; everything he did was elegant. Elizabeth went home with her mind filled only with thoughts of him.</t1541> <t1542>On the way back, she could think of nothing but Mr. Wickham and what he had told her.</t1542> <t1543>But she could not even mention his name, because both Lydia and Mr. Collins did not stop talking.</t1543> <t1544>Lydia chattered on about lottery tickets, about the cards she won and lost.</t1544> <t1545>Mr. Collins talked about everything, describing the politeness of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, insisting that he did not care about the money lost at the whist game, naming and praising every dish, repeatedly saying that he took up the cousins' seats, and he still wanted to say more when the carriage stopped at Longbourn.</t1545>
<t1546>Chapter 17</t1546>
<t1547>Elizabeth recounted to Jane the things she had discussed with Mr. Wickham, and Jane listened with astonishment and anxiety.</t1547> <t1548>She did not know how to believe that Mr. Darcy was not worthy of Mr. Bingley's esteem.</t1548> <t1549>However, her nature could not doubt the sincerity of someone as charming as Mr. Wickham.</t1549> <t1550>The fact that he had truly endured such cruel actions was enough to stir tender feelings within her.</t1550> <t1551>Therefore, there was nothing left to do but to think well of both men, justify their characters, and consider the possibility of unfortunate circumstances or misunderstandings—anything that could not be explained in any other way.</t1551>
<t1552>She said:</t1552>
<t1553>- You could say that both of them were deceived in one way or another – the exact way we do not know.</t1553> <t1554>Perhaps one person misunderstood the other.</t1554> <t1555>In short, we cannot speculate on the reasons or circumstances that caused them to drift apart, so we cannot blame either of them.</t1555>
<t1556>- Actually, that's true.</t1556> <t1557>Now, Jane, what can you say on behalf of those who might be concerned about the matter?</t1557> <t1558>We should consider that neither is to blame, otherwise we would have to think badly of someone.</t1558>
<t1559>- You can laugh freely, but you cannot mock my opinion.</t1559> <t1560>Lizzy, just think about how Mr. Darcy will be disgraced, after having treated so poorly the person whom his father favored, the person his father promised to take care of.</t1560> <t1561>It cannot be, no one with ordinary humanity, no one with any value of character, could do such a thing.</t1561> <t1562>Could it be that his best friend was so greatly deceived? It cannot be!</t1562>
<t1563>- I can believe that Mr. Bingley was deceived more easily than that Mr. Wickham fabricated the story as he told me last night; the names, the events, everything was mentioned in a natural manner.</t1563> <t1564>If it were not so, let Mr. Darcy refute it.</t1564> <t1565>Moreover, Mr. Darcy's manner somewhat speaks the truth.</t1565>
<t1566>- It's really hard to think, really sad.</t1566> <t1567>People don't know what to think.</t1567>
<t1568>- Sorry, ma'am, people know exactly what to think.</t1568>
<t1569>But Jane could only be sure of one thing – that Mr. Bingley, if truly deceived, would suffer greatly when the matter became public.</t1569>
<t1570>The two ladies were called into the house because there were guests – the very people they had just mentioned.</t1570> <t1571>He and his sisters came to deliver invitations for the ball at Netherfield on the following Tuesday.</t1571> <t1572>The two Bingley women were delighted to see their dear friend Jane again, feeling it had been a long time since they last met, and repeatedly asked her what she had been doing for herself since their parting.</t1572> <t1573>The two ladies paid little attention to the other family members, avoided Mrs. Bennet if possible, spoke little to Elizabeth, and said nothing to the other girls.</t1573>
<t1574>Everyone in the family was eagerly looking forward to the ball.</t1574> <t1575>Mrs. Bennet saw this as an event for her eldest daughter, particularly proud to receive a personal invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a formal card.</t1575> <t1576>Jane imagined she would have a happy evening with her two friends, along with the attention of her cousin.</t1576> <t1577>Elizabeth thought of the joy of dancing many dances with Mr. Wickham, and seeing everything proven through Mr. Darcy's attitude and gestures.</t1577> <t1578>The joy that Catherine and Lydia anticipated did not depend much on any particular event or person, for although they liked dancing with Mr. Wickham, they did not focus solely on him, and after all, a ball was just a ball.</t1578> <t1579>Even Mary reassured the family that she would not be reluctant to attend.</t1579> <t1580>She said:</t1580>
<t1581>- As long as you have your own mornings, that is enough. Occasionally, you can participate in evening parties without feeling forced.</t1581> <t1582>Society has bound everyone, but you are one of those who believe that everyone occasionally desires entertainment and enjoyment that everyone wishes for.</t1582>
<t1583>Elizabeth's spirits were so high that, although she did not like conversing with Mr. Collins unless absolutely necessary, she could not help but ask if he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation and, if he did, whether he thought it proper to attend an evening of enjoyment.</t1583> <t1584>She was quite surprised to hear him say that his mind harbored no such scruples; he was not afraid of being reprimanded by the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh for daring to participate in the dance.</t1584> <t1585>He said:</t1585>
<t1586>- I do not intend to view this type of ball, organized by a person of standing for respectable attendees, as potentially having an unhealthy tendency.</t1586> <t1587>I do not wish to refuse to participate in the dance, so that I may have the honor of the hands of my beautiful cousins, and I will take this opportunity to request the hand of Miss Elizabeth, especially for the first two dances – a preference which I believe Miss Jane will understand is not due to any lack of respect for her.</t1587>
<t1588>Elizabeth felt completely awkward.</t1588> <t1589>She had hoped to dance with Mr. Wickham for the first two dances, but instead, it was Mr. Collins!</t1589> <t1590>Never had her lively personality been so poorly scheduled!</t1590> <t1591>But there was no other way.</t1591> <t1592>The joy of Mr. Wickham and hers would have to be postponed a bit; she accepted Mr. Collins' invitation with the most cheerful attitude she could muster.</t1592> <t1593>She was no happier with his flattering manner, thinking it indicated something.</t1593> <t1594>Now she suddenly realized that, among her sisters, he had chosen her to be the mistress of the Hunsford Parsonage, and also to fill a seat at the card table at Rossings in the absence of any more qualified guest.</t1594> <t1595>The thought gradually turned into conviction as she noticed him becoming increasingly courteous to her, especially when she heard him praise her intelligence and liveliness.</t1595> <t1596>Although feeling more surprised than pleased, it wasn't long before her mother hinted that she was very happy about the possibility of a wedding between the two.</t1596> <t1597>However, Elizabeth did not want to acknowledge the implication, knowing that any response would lead to a heated argument.</t1597> <t1598>Mr. Collins might never propose, so there was no point in arguing about him at this moment.</t1598>
<t1599>If it weren't for the Netherfield ball to prepare for and discuss, the Bennet sisters would surely feel miserable, as the continuous rain from the day they were invited until the ball prevented them from going to Meryton.</t1599> <t1600>Unable to visit their aunt, unable to meet the officers, no new news, they had to substitute with Netherfield.</t1600> <t1601>Even Elizabeth felt her patience being tested, as her efforts to strengthen her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham were completely stalled.</t1601> <t1602>As for Kitty and Lydia, if it weren't for the ball on Tuesday, there would be nothing else to help them endure Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.</t1602>
<t1603>Chapter 18</t1603>
<t1604>Elizabeth never doubted that Mr. Wickham would be absent from the ball, until she entered the drawing room at Netherfield and searched for him in vain among the men in red coats.</t1604> <t1605>She had been so sure he would be there, that she did not review her memories for any event that might have alerted her.</t1605> <t1606>She had dressed more carefully than usual, and prepared with the greatest eagerness to conquer all that remained unconquered in his heart, thinking that it could be achieved in just one evening.</t1606> <t1607>But suddenly, she had the dreadful thought that he had been deliberately excluded from Mr. Bingley's guest list to please Mr. Darcy.</t1607> <t1608>Although this was not entirely true, Mr. Denny conveyed the news of his absence when Lydia spoke with him.</t1608> <t1609>Denny reported that Wickham had to attend to business in town the day before and had not yet returned.</t1609> <t1610>He added, with a suggestive smile:</t1610>
<t1611>- I can't imagine any job that would make him leave at this moment, unless he wants to avoid someone here.</t1611>
<t1612>Although Lydia did not notice, Elizabeth heard it.</t1612> <t1613>Though this news reassured her that Darcy was not much involved in Wickham's absence as she had initially suspected, all her resentment towards Darcy grew even more intense due to her disappointment, to the extent that she could not respond with the minimal courtesy to his polite questions.</t1613> <t1614>She thought that showing interest, tolerance, and patience towards Darcy would hurt Wickham.</t1614> <t1615>She resolved not to speak to Darcy anymore, turning away with a bit of irritation that she could not entirely suppress even when conversing with Mr. Bingley, and was further provoked by his blind partiality.</t1615>
<t1616>However, Elizabeth's personality did not hold onto resentment for long.</t1616> <t1617>Although all her hopes for the evening had faded away, her spirits gradually became comfortable again.</t1617> <t1618>After sharing all her feelings with Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen in a week, she soon willingly moved on to the peculiarities of her cousin, telling her friend about him.</t1618> <t1619>However, the first two dances brought about sorrow; they were two torturous pieces.</t1619> <t1620>Mr. Collins, clumsy and miserable, apologized instead of attending to her, often stepping out of rhythm without realizing it, bringing her all the shame and misery of an unpleasant dance partner.</t1620> <t1621>She was delighted to be rid of him.</t1621>
<t1622>She danced the next set with an officer, feeling happy to hear about Wickham and knowing that everyone adored him.</t1622> <t1623>After the music ended, she returned to Charlotte Lucas.</t1623> <t1624>While they were conversing, Mr. Darcy suddenly approached her.</t1624> <t1625>He surprised her by asking her to dance.</t1625> <t1626>Without thinking, she accepted.</t1626> <t1627>He immediately turned and walked away; she was left feeling irritated at her own lack of judgment.</t1627> <t1628>Charlotte tried to console her.</t1628>
<t1629>- I think you will find him very likable.</t1629>
<t1630>- How miserable! That would be the most unfortunate thing for everyone!</t1630> <t1631>To see someone you deliberately hate being so likable!</t1631> <t1632>Don't wish me such a malicious thing.</t1632>
<t1633>However, when the dance music started and Darcy returned to take her hand, Charlotte couldn't help but whisper in her ear not to foolishly dream of Wickham and become unpleasant in the eyes of someone ten times higher in status.</t1633> <t1634>Elizabeth did not reply, accepted the dance with him, feeling surprised at how her own dignity had changed to allow her to face Mr. Darcy, and read in the eyes of the other dancing couples an equal surprise at seeing the two of them together.</t1634> <t1635>For a long while, neither of them spoke a word; she began to imagine that their silence would last throughout the two dances.</t1635> <t1636>At first, she had no intention of breaking the silence, until she suddenly thought that the heaviest punishment for him would be to make him speak, so she made some idle remarks about the ball.</t1636> <t1637>He replied, then fell silent again.</t1637> <t1638>A moment later, she spoke again for the second time.</t1638>
<t1639>- Mr. Darcy, it's your turn to say something.</t1639> <t1640>I've talked about the ball, now you must make some remarks about the size of the room, or the number of dancing couples.</t1640>
<t1641>He smiled, assuring her that he would say anything she wanted him to say.</t1641>
<t1642>- Very good.</t1642> <t1643>That answer is sufficient for now.</t1643> <t1644>Perhaps gradually I can observe that family dances are more enjoyable than public dances.</t1644> <t1645>But now we can be silent.</t1645>
<t1646>- Do you often talk while you are dancing?</t1646>
<t1647>- Sometimes.</t1647> <t1648>People need to chat a little, you know.</t1648> <t1649>It does look odd if we stay silent with each other for half an hour, but for some people, it is necessary to arrange the conversation in such a way that they can be bothered to speak as much as possible.</t1649>
<t1650>- Are you probing your own feelings in this case, or do you think you are probing mine?</t1650>
<t1651>Elizabeth replied mischievously:</t1651>
<t1652>- Both, because I realized there is a similarity in the way both of us shift our thoughts.</t1652> <t1653>Both of us have a difficult temperament, sullen, unwilling to speak, except when we want to say something that surprises the whole room, to be passed down to future generations with all the glory of a proverb.</t1653>
<t1654>- This is not at all like your nature, I am sure of it.</t1654> <t1655>I dare not say how it aligns with my nature.</t1655> <t1656>Surely you think it is a true portrait.</t1656>
<t1657>- I should not conclude about my nature.</t1657>
<t1658>He did not answer.</t1658> <t1659>The two fell into silence again until near the end of the piece, when he asked her whether she and her sisters often went to Meryton.</t1659> <t1660>She said yes and, unable to resist the temptation, added:</t1660>
<t1661>- When you met us the other day, we had just gotten to know someone new.</t1661>
<t1662>He had an immediate reaction.</t1662> <t1663>A profound arrogance spread across his face, but he did not say a word.</t1663> <t1664>Elizabeth, though blaming herself for being too weak, could not continue.</t1664> <t1665>Finally, Darcy spoke, restraining himself:</t1665>
<t1666>- Mr. Wickham is fortunate to be endowed with a cheerful demeanor that makes it easy for him to make friends; whether he has the ability to maintain those friendships, I am not sure.</t1666>
<t1667>Elizabeth replied:</t1667>
<t1668>- He was unfortunate because he lost his friendship with you.</t1668>
<t1669>She emphasized further:</t1669>
<t1670>- And in the way that he might suffer for a lifetime.</t1670>
<t1671>Darcy did not reply, seemingly wanting to change the subject.</t1671> <t1672>At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared near them, but upon seeing Darcy, he bowed with the courtesy of an elder to compliment him on his dance steps and his dance partner.</t1672>
<t1673>- I am very pleased, sir.</t1673> <t1674>One rarely sees such dancing artistry.</t1674> <t1675>Obviously, you belong to the upper class.</t1675> <t1676>However, allow me to say that your beautiful dance partner does not make you ashamed, and I wish to often have such joy, especially when a happy event is about to take place.</t1676> <t1677>So many congratulations will pour in!</t1677> <t1678>I ask Mr. Darcy not to let me interrupt you, sir.</t1678> <t1679>You will not thank me for pulling you away from the enchanting conversation of this young lady with bright eyes who also seems to blame me.</t1679>
<t1680>Darcy did not clearly hear the end of this speech, but Sir William's insinuations seemed to strike him deeply.</t1680> <t1681>His eyes, with a very serious expression, turned towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together at that moment.</t1681> <t1682>But he quickly regained his composure, turned to his dance partner, and said:</t1682>
<t1683>- Sir William interrupted, making me forget what we were talking about.</t1683>
<t1684>- I don't think we are talking about anything at all.</t1684> <t1685>Sir William cannot interrupt two people in this room when they have nothing to say to each other.</t1685> <t1686>We have tried two or three topics without success, so I cannot think of what we will talk about next.</t1686>
<t1687>He said, smiling:</t1687>
<t1688>- What do you think about books?</t1688>
<t1689>- Books? Oh! No, I'm sure we never read the same kind of books, or read with the same feelings.</t1689>
<t1690>- It's a pity that you think so, but if that's the case, at least we won't lack topics.</t1690> <t1691>We can compare different viewpoints.</t1691>
<t1692>- No, I cannot talk about books in a ballroom; my mind is always filled with other things.</t1692>
<t1693>He asked, with a doubtful look:</t1693>
<t1694>- The present always preoccupies you in these settings, doesn't it?</t1694>
<t1695>- Yes, always like that.</t1695>
<t1696>She answered without knowing what she was saying, as her thoughts had wandered off the subject, but then suddenly appeared:</t1696>
<t1697>- Mr. Darcy, I remember the other day, you mentioned that you rarely forgive, and once you are offended, nothing can soothe you.</t1697> <t1698>I suppose you are very cautious about becoming offended in the first place</t1698><t1699>.</t1699>
<t1700>He spoke firmly:</t1700>
<t1701>- That's right.</t1701>
<t1702>- And you never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice, do you?</t1702>
<t1703>- I hope so.</t1703>
<t1704>- Those who never change their opinions must possess this virtue to ensure sound judgment from the very beginning.</t1704>
<t1705>- May I ask, what are you aiming for?</t1705>
<t1706>She said, trying to be gentle:</t1706>
<t1707>- It's just an illustration of your nature.</t1707> <t1708>I'm trying to figure out what that nature is like.</t1708>
<t1709>- And how did she realize it?</t1709>
<t1710>She shook her head:</t1710>
<t1711>- I don't understand anything.</t1711> <t1712>I hear different things about you that make me very confused.</t1712>
<t1713>He replied, sternly:</t1713>
<t1714>- I can readily believe that what people say about me varies greatly.</t1714> <t1715>Miss Bennet, I hope you will not hastily sketch out my character at this moment, for there is reason to fear that doing so correctly or incorrectly will not be properly reflected.</t1715>
<t1716>- But if I don't try to create a portrait of you now, I might never have another chance.</t1716>
<t1717>He said coldly:</t1717>
<t1718>- I have no intention of stopping you if you like it.</t1718>
<t1719>She said nothing more. The two continued with another piece of music and then parted in silence.</t1719> <t1720>Each felt a sense of resentment, though to different degrees, for within Darcy there was already a strong feeling towards her, allowing him to forgive her and direct all his anger towards someone else.</t1720>
<t1721>They parted ways not long before Miss Bingley arrived, her face disdainful.</t1721>
<t1722>- Ah, Miss Eliza, I heard that you are quite fond of George Wickham! Your sister has told me about him and asked me a thousand questions.</t1722> <t1723>I see that the young man forgot to tell you that he is the son of old Mr. Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward.</t1723> <t1724>However, as a friend, I advise you not to believe everything he says.</t1724> <t1725>The notion that Mr. Darcy treated him poorly is completely wrong, for on the contrary, Mr. Darcy has always been very kind to him, even though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in the most shameful manner.</t1725> <t1726>I do not know the details, but I know very clearly that Mr. Darcy is not to blame at all, and he does not want to hear anyone speak of George Wickham.</t1726> <t1727>Although my brother could not help but invite him to the ball, he was very glad to see him voluntarily absent.</t1727> <t1728>His moving to this area was indeed an insolent act; I wonder how he could have the audacity to do so.</t1728> <t1729>I pity you, Eliza, for discovering the wrongdoings of the person you admire, but considering his decline, no one could expect anything better.</t1729>
<t1730>Elizabeth angrily:</t1730>
<t1731>- According to what she said, his wrongdoing and his decline seemed to be one and the same, because I heard her condemn him for nothing worse than being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, but I inform you that he himself told me about this.</t1731>
<t1732>I'm sorry for interfering.</t1732> <t1733>I only had good intentions.</t1733>
<t1734>Miss Bingley turned away, sneering.</t1734>
<t1735>Elizabeth whispered: "You are the one who is being insolent!</t1735> <t1736>You are greatly mistaken if you think you can influence me with such vile words.</t1736> <t1737>I see nothing in this but your deliberate ignorance and Mr. Darcy's malice."</t1737>
<t1738>Then she went to find her eldest sister; her sister had already inquired Mr. Bingley about the same subject.</t1738> <t1739>Jane met her younger sister with a sweet, satisfied smile, her face glowing with happiness, clearly showing she had enjoyed the evening very much.</t1739> <t1740>Elizabeth immediately understood her sister's feelings.</t1740>
<t1741>She asked, with a smile as bright as her sister's:</t1741>
<t1742>- I want to know what you have found out about Mr. Wickham.</t1742> <t1743>But perhaps you are too happy to think about a third person, in which case I apologize to you.</t1743>
<t1744>Jane replied:</t1744>
<t1745>- No, I haven't forgotten him, but I have nothing good to say to you about him.</t1745> <t1746>Mr. Bingley does not know everything about his past, and he is almost unaware of the circumstances that offended Mr. Darcy, but he can vouch for his friend's good conduct, honesty, and honor.</t1746> <t1747>He firmly believes that Mr. Wickham does not deserve Mr. Darcy's attention.</t1747> <t1748>I regret to say that, according to him and his sister, Mr. Wickham is not a respectable person.</t1748> <t1749>I fear that Wickham is too reckless and that Mr. Darcy's dislike of him is justified.</t1749>
<t1750>- Mr. Bingley doesn't know Mr. Wickham?</t1750>
<t1751>- No; I only met him this morning at Meryton.</t1751>
<t1752>- So, what you know is through Mr. Darcy.</t1752> <t1753>I am completely satisfied.</t1753> <t1754>But what did he say about the church income?</t1754>
<t1755>- He does not remember anything about this matter, although more than once he has heard from Mr. Darcy, but he believes that this amount was left conditionally for Wickham.</t1755>
<t1756>Elizabeth said warmly:</t1756>
<t1757>- I have no doubt about Mr. Bingley's sincerity, but you must forgive me if I am not convinced by his assurances.</t1757> <t1758>I can acknowledge that Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend has some basis, but since he is unaware of certain parts of the story and only knows the rest through his friend, I still think of Wickham and Darcy as I did before.</t1758>
<t1759>Then she changed the conversation to a topic that everyone felt more comfortable with and that did not cause emotional conflict.</t1759> <t1760>Elizabeth happily listened to the modest hopes for happiness that Jane harbored about Bingley, and did her best to reinforce her sister's belief.</t1760> <t1761>When Mr. Bingley arrived, she returned to find Miss Lucas but gave brief answers to her questions about her recent dance partner before Mr. Collins approached.</t1761> <t1762>He cheerfully told her that he had just been fortunate to discover something important.</t1762>
<t1763>- I happened to learn that there is currently someone in the room who has a close relationship with my benefactor.</t1763> <t1764>I accidentally overheard him mentioning the name of this hostess, who is his cousin, Miss De Bourgh, and the name of her mother, Lady Catherine. It is wonderful to know this.</t1764> <t1765>Who could have guessed that I would meet Lady Catherine's nephew here! I am very pleased to have learned this just in time to greet him, and I believe he will forgive me for not knowing about this relationship, which can serve as an excuse for my apology.</t1765>
<t1766>- You don't intend to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy, do you?</t1766>
<t1767>- Actually, I intended to do so.</t1767> <t1768>I will ask for your forgiveness for not doing this sooner.</t1768> <t1769>I believe you are Lady Catherine's nephew. I will do my best to assure you that the lady is still in good health.</t1769>
<t1770>Elizabeth tried to persuade him to abandon the idea, making him understand that Mr. Darcy would consider his approaching to start a conversation without an introduction as an improper and presumptuous attitude rather than a friendly inquiry about his aunt; that there was no need for them to recognize each other; that if necessary, Mr. Darcy should be the one to take the initiative to get acquainted due to his higher status.</t1770> <t1771>Mr. Collins listened to her with a determined look, still wanting to keep his intention, and when she finished speaking, he replied:</t1771>
<t1772>- Dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the utmost respect for your excellent judgment on all matters within your understanding, but allow me to say that there is a significant difference between the manners of the secular world and the rituals of the clergy.</t1772> <t1773>I must say that I regard the institution of the clergy with the same dignity as the highest titles in the kingdom – provided that proper humility is maintained in conduct.</t1773> <t1774>Therefore, you must allow me to follow the call of my conscience in this situation, so that I may perform what I consider to be a duty.</t1774> <t1775>Forgive me for not taking advantage of your advice, which would be a guiding star for me in other areas, although in the present case, I consider myself to have more understanding than a young lady like you, due to my education and constant learning, to decide what is right.</t1775>
<t1776>He bent down and then went to meet Mr. Darcy.</t1776> <t1777>She eagerly watched how Mr. Darcy greeted him, clearly seeing that Mr. Darcy was very surprised to be approached.</t1777> <t1778>Her cousin began with a formal bow, though she couldn't hear what he said, she had the impression she heard everything clearly, watching his lips form the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh."</t1778> <t1779>Her heart fluttered seeing him expose himself to such a person.</t1779> <t1780>Mr. Darcy looked at him with undisguised astonishment, and when Mr. Collins finally stopped speaking, he responded with little politeness.</t1780> <t1781>However, Mr. Collins was not discouraged and said a few more words, and Mr. Darcy's attitude seemed even more disdainful of what he heard.</t1781> <t1782>Finally, Mr. Collins bowed slightly and returned to Elizabeth.</t1782> <t1783>He said:</t1783>
<t1784>- I have no reason to be dissatisfied with the audience.</t1784> <t1785>Mr. Darcy seemed very pleased with my interest.</t1785> <t1786>He responded to me very politely, and even complimented me by saying that he had great faith in Lady Catherine's judgment, knowing that she would never bestow favors on someone unworthy.</t1786> <t1787>That was a very generous thought.</t1787> <t1788>Overall, I am very satisfied with him.</t1788>
<t1789>Since Elizabeth no longer cared about anything else, she paid close attention to her sister and Mr. Bingley.</t1789><t1790>The sight of the two being close to each other made her feel a joy almost as great as what Jane was experiencing.</t1790><t1791>She imagined her sister living in this very house with all the happiness that a marriage based on love could bring, and in this context, she thought she could even grow fond of Bingley's two sisters.</t1791><t1792>She clearly saw that her mother's intentions were aligned with the same feelings, so she decided not to go near her for fear of hearing too much.</t1792><t1793>Thus, when they sat down to eat, she found the unfortunate circumstance that had placed her and her mother close to each other, and she was very uneasy to see her mother talking comfortably and openly with Lady Lucas, discussing nothing but her expectations of seeing Jane soon married to Mr. Bingley.</t1793><t1794>It was a lively topic, and Mrs. Bennet seemed tireless in listing the advantages of the marriage.</t1794><t1795>The first points she boasted about were a charming, wealthy young man living only three miles away; and then it was truly comforting to see that his two sisters also liked Jane, being sure that they too desired the match as much as she did.</t1795><t1796>Moreover, this was a promising situation for the younger siblings, as Jane's wedding and such a brother-in-law would bring them closer to other wealthy men, and finally, it was a relief in this stage of her life to be able to entrust the care of her unmarried daughters to their elder sister, so when they went out to socialize, she wouldn't have to follow them more closely than she wished.</t1796><t1797>In this situation, it was necessary to accept and find joy, due to the social etiquette of such occasions, although she did not feel as comfortable as everyone else being confined indoors at any stage of life.</t1797><t1798>She concluded with many good wishes for Lady Lucas to soon be as fortunate as she was, although she confidently believed with a sense of triumph that her friend would have no such luck.</t1798>
<t1799>Elizabeth tried in vain to curb her mother's incessant chatter or persuade her not to be so loud in expressing her happiness, for in an indescribable agitation, she could see Mr. Darcy, sitting opposite them, had overheard most of the conversation.</t1799> <t1800>Her mother only scolded her for being unreasonable.</t1800>
<t1801>- What is Mr. Darcy to you that makes you afraid of him?</t1801> <t1802>You know very well that you don't need to be so polite to him that you dare not say something he might not like to hear.</t1802>
<t1803>- Mom, please, I beg you to speak softly.</t1803> <t1804>What good does it do to insult Mr. Darcy?</t1804> <t1805>His friends will never think well of you if you keep doing that.</t1805>
<t1806>However, her words had no effect.</t1806> <t1807>The mother still blatantly voiced her opinions.</t1807> <t1808>Elizabeth kept blushing out of embarrassment and unease.</t1808> <t1809>She couldn't help but occasionally glance at Mr. Darcy, seeing exactly what she had feared; for although he seldom looked at her, she believed he was still attentively listening.</t1809> <t1810>His expression gradually changed from contemptuous indignation to sternness and calmness.</t1810>
<t1811>In the end, Mrs. Bennet had nothing more to say.</t1811> <t1812>Lady Lucas, having yawned at the long-winded accounts of joys she saw no chance of sharing, was left in peace to enjoy the ham and chicken.</t1812> <t1813>Elizabeth began to recover.</t1813> <t1814>But the tranquility did not last long, for when the meal ended, a suggestion was made for singing, and she felt tormented seeing Mary, after a little encouragement, preparing to contribute to the entertainment.</t1814> <t1815>She tried to prevent such indulgence with many suggestive and pleading glances, but to no avail.</t1815> <t1816>Mary did not care to understand; such an opportunity to perform was her delight, and she began her song.</t1816> <t1817>Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her sister with the most wretched feelings; and she restlessly watched her through several not very well-received musical passages as they concluded.</t1817> <t1818>Upon receiving thanks, Mary also perceived the implied wish for her to sing another song, so she began again.</t1818> <t1819>Mary's talents were not suited for such a style of performance; she had a weak voice and overly affected mannerisms. Elizabeth fell into despair.</t1819> <t1820>She looked over at Jane to see how her sister was enduring it, but Jane was calmly conversing with Bingley.</t1820> <t1821>She looked at her two younger sisters, seeing them making mocking gestures at each other. She looked at Darcy, seeing him still stern and reserved.</t1821> <t1822>She glanced at her father to implore him to intervene, lest Mary sing all night.</t1822> <t1823>He understood, and when Mary finished her second song, he spoke loudly:</t1823>
<t1824>- That's good enough, my daughter. You have entertained enough.</t1824> <t1825>Let the other young ladies have their time to perform.</t1825>
<t1826>Although pretending not to hear, Mary felt somewhat disappointed.</t1826> <t1827>Elizabeth pitied Mary, pitied her father, but feared that worrying would still not help.</t1827> <t1828>The others were encouraged to show their talents.</t1828> <t1829>Mr. Collins said:</t1829>
<t1830>- If I were fortunate enough to have a good singing voice, I would be very honored to contribute to the enjoyment, as I consider music a healthy pastime and entirely compatible with a clergyman.</t1830> <t1831>However, I do not mean to say that we have a legitimate reason to spend much time on music, as there are certainly other tasks that need to be done.</t1831> <t1832>A pastor managing a parish has many tasks to handle.</t1832> <t1833>First and foremost, he must arrange with the higher powers to be effective in his duties without offending his patron.</t1833> <t1834>He must write his own sermons, and the remaining time cannot be so extensive that it neglects parish duties.</t1834> <t1835>He also has to take care of and improve his living quarters without being condemned for extravagance.</t1835> <t1836>I consider it equally important that he must have an attitude of care and reconciliation with everyone, especially those who have elevated him.</t1836> <t1837>I cannot exempt him from these duties, just as I cannot think well of someone who has missed the opportunity to show respect to anyone related to the family.</t1837>
<t1838>He leaned towards Mr. Darcy as he concluded his speech, which was delivered loudly enough for half the room to hear clearly.</t1838> <t1839>Many people stared at him intently.</t1839> <t1840>Many people smiled, but no one appeared as interested as Mr. Bennet, while his wife enthusiastically praised Mr. Collins for his heartfelt words, whispering to Mrs. Lucas that he was a particularly virtuous and wise young man.</t1840>
<t1841>For Elizabeth, it seemed as though her family had conspired together to showcase themselves as prominently as possible on this occasion; they could not have played their roles with higher spirits or better results.</t1841> <t1842>She thought Mr. Bingley and her sister were truly fortunate that he did not notice some of the performances, and his feelings were not too distressed by the ridiculous actions he had witnessed.</t1842> <t1843>However, she found it unfortunate that Mr. Bingley’s sisters and Mr. Darcy had the opportunity to mock her relatives, and she was unsure whether Mr. Darcy's silent arrogance or the sisters' disdainful smiles were more bearable.</t1843>
<t1844>She did not feel any joy in the remaining time.</t1844> <t1845>Mr. Collins teased her, persistently clinging to her; and although he could not dance with her again, he found ways to prevent her from dancing with others.</t1845> <t1846>She earnestly asked him to dance with someone else and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the room, but he refused.</t1846> <t1847>He reassured her that he did not like dancing at all, that his main purpose was the delicate attentions he wanted to bestow upon her, and thus he wanted to make his intentions clear by staying close to her for the rest of the time.</t1847> <t1848>There was no arguing about this.</t1848> <t1849>She felt greatly relieved whenever Miss Lucas came over to them and cheerfully started a conversation with Mr. Collins.</t1849>
<t1850>At least she no longer had to endure the annoyance of Mr. Darcy paying her any more attention.</t1850> <t1851>Although he often stayed a short distance away, somewhat unburdened, he never came close enough to converse.</t1851> <t1852>She thought it might be because she had hinted at Mr. Wickham, and she was glad about this.</t1852>
<t1853>The Longbourn family left the ball last.</t1853> <t1854>With Mrs. Bennet's arrangements, they had to wait for their carriage for 15 minutes after everyone else had gone.</t1854> <t1855>This gave them enough time to see how warmly some members of the host family bid them farewell.</t1855> <t1856>Mrs. Hurst and her sister barely spoke except to complain of tiredness, clearly wanting to see the guests off as quickly as possible.</t1856> <t1857>The two did not want to continue conversing with Mrs. Bennet, despite her attempts to start a conversation, and this created an awkward atmosphere for everyone.</t1857> <t1858>Mr. Collins did not help matters by going on at length praising Mr. Bingley and his two sisters for their elegance in manners, as well as their outstanding hospitality and courtesy towards the guests.</t1858> <t1859>Darcy said nothing.</t1859> <t1860>Mr. Bennet, also in silence, amused himself by observing the scene around him.</t1860> <t1861>Mr. Bingley and Jane stood together, slightly apart from everyone else, speaking only to each other.</t1861> <t1862>Even Lydia was too tired to say anything more than “Oh my, I am so tired!” accompanied by a long yawn.</t1862>
<t1863>Finally, when they bid each other farewell, Mrs. Bennet, with the most constrained politeness, expressed her desire to welcome the entire family to Longbourn, specifically telling Mr. Bingley that everyone would be very happy if he could come for an informal meal with the family at any time, instead of a formal invitation.</t1863> <t1864>Bingley cheerfully accepted, willing to take advantage of the earliest opportunity to visit her after he returned from London, as he had to leave the next day for a short period.</t1864>
<t1865>Mrs. Bennet was completely satisfied, leaving with the joy that, after preparing for the settlement of living arrangements, new carriages, and wedding dresses, she would surely see her daughter settled at Netherfield within three to four months.</t1865> <t1866>Thinking about another daughter marrying Mr. Collins also brought her great joy, though not to the same extent.</t1866> <t1867>Among the daughters, she loved Elizabeth the least, although the second suitor and match were good enough for her, the value of Mr. Bingley and Netherfield still surpassed them.</t1867>
<t1868>Chapter 19</t1868>
<t1869>A new scene unfolded at Longbourn the next day.</t1869> <t1870>Mr. Collins had solemnly expressed his intentions.</t1870> <t1871>Having decided not to waste time since he could only take leave until Saturday, and feeling no shyness to be troubled even at this moment, he began in a very orderly manner, adhering to all the formalities of the matter.</t1871> <t1872>After breakfast, with Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of her sisters present, he spoke to the mother:</t1872>
<t1873>- Madam, for the love you bear your beautiful daughter Elizabeth, could you grant me the honor of a private conversation with her this morning?</t1873>
<t1874>While Elizabeth had not yet had time to react except to blush, Mrs. Bennet quickly replied:</t1874>
<t1875>- Ah, yes, certainly, I'm sure Lizzy will be very happy.</t1875> <t1876>I'm sure the girl won't refuse.</t1876> <t1877>Come here, Kitty, I want you to go upstairs.</t1877>
<t1878>As she was hurrying along, Elizabeth called after her:</t1878>
<t1879>- Mom, please don't go.</t1879> <t1880>I beg you, don't go.</t1880> <t1881>Please forgive me, Mr. Collins.</t1881> <t1882>He has nothing to say to me that others don't need to hear.</t1882> <t1883>I'm about to leave as well.</t1883>
<t1884>- No, no, don't be unreasonable, Lizzy.</t1884> <t1885>Your mother wants you to sit back down there.</t1885>
<t1886>And when she saw Elizabeth with a frustrated and embarrassed expression as if wanting to hide, she added:</t1886>
<t1887>- Lizzy, your mother wants you to stay and listen to Mr. Collins.</t1887>
<t1888>Elizabeth could not resist this command.</t1888> <t1889>A moment of consideration helped her think that the wisest course was to resolve the matter as quickly and smoothly as possible.</t1889> <t1890>She sat down, trying to conceal her mixed feelings of distress and distraction.</t1890> <t1891>Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked away, and soon after, Mr. Collins began.</t1891>
<t1892>- Dear Miss Elizabeth, please believe that your humility so far has not harmed you at all; on the contrary, it complements your perfections.</t1892> <t1893>In my eyes, you might be less charming if you had not shown such modesty, but I assure you that your esteemed mother has permitted me to converse with you in this manner.</t1893> <t1894>Surely you do not doubt my intentions, although your innate delicacy might make you ignore them; my feelings are too clear to be mistaken.</t1894> <t1895>From the moment I entered this house, I chose you as my companion for my future life.</t1895> <t1896>But before I stray too far from the subject due to my emotions in this matter, perhaps I should state the reasons for marriage when I came to Hertfordshire with the intention of finding a wife, for indeed I had this intention.</t1896>
<t1897>The idea of Mr. Collins, in all his calm solemnity, about straying from the subject due to his emotions, made Elizabeth almost burst into laughter to the point where she couldn't seize the opportunity when he paused to stop him.</t1897> <t1898>He continued.</t1898>
<t1899>- My reasons for marriage are, first, I think every clergyman, when in favorable circumstances, should set a good example of married life in his parish.</t1899><t1900>Second, I believe that married life will bring me boundless happiness; and third, which I should have mentioned first, due to the advice of the noble lady whom I have the honor to call my patroness.</t1900><t1901>Twice she has condescended to give me her opinion on this matter, and only last Saturday before I left Hunsford, she said: “Mr. Collins, you must marry.</t1901><t1902>A clergyman like you must marry.</t1902><t1903>Choose carefully, select a good woman for me, and for yourself; she must be active and useful, not necessarily high-born but should be capable of managing household finances.</t1903><t1904>That is my advice.</t1904><t1905>Find such a woman as soon as possible, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.”</t1905><t1906>By the way, my dear, allow me to remark that I consider Lady Catherine de Bourgh's concern and advice among my favorable circumstances.</t1906><t1907>You will find her character far surpasses what I have described; your wit and vivacity will please her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect that her position inevitably commands.</t1907><t1908>While I have intentions of marriage, I must also explain why I am inclined towards Longbourn rather than the area where I currently reside, which also has many charming young ladies.</t1908><t1909>I will inherit this estate after your esteemed father passes away, and I would not be at ease if I did not choose one of his daughters as my spouse, so that they would suffer less when that unfortunate event occurs, although, as I have said, it will not happen for many years.</t1909><t1910>My dear, that is my motivation, which I hope will not make you think less of me.</t1910><t1911>Now, I have nothing more to say except to confirm to you, in the most vivid terms, my ardent affection.</t1911><t1912>I am completely indifferent to money, and will not ask your father for anything in this regard because I know well that he cannot provide, and that you will only inherit a sum of one thousand pounds at four percent, which you will only receive after your mother's death.</t1912><t1913>Therefore, on this matter, I will remain entirely silent.</t1913><t1914>You can trust that I will not be so narrow-minded as to utter any complaints once we are married.</t1914>
<t1915>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt the guy now.</t1915> <t1916>She exclaimed:</t1916>
<t1917>- Sir, you have been too hasty.</t1917> <t1918>You forgot that I have not yet answered.</t1918> <t1919>I will answer immediately to avoid wasting more time.</t1919> <t1920>I thank you for your compliments.</t1920> <t1921>I am very touched by your proposal, but I can do nothing other than decline.</t1921>
<t1922>Mr. Collins replied, with a ceremonious wave of his hand:</t1922>
<t1923>- Until now, I have always known that when a young man proposes for the first time, young women often refuse while inwardly they are inclined to accept, and that they may refuse two or even three times.</t1923> <t1924>Therefore, I was not discouraged by what you just said, but rather hopeful that I would soon be married to you.</t1924>
<t1925>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t1925>
<t1926>- Sir, I must say that your hope is quite unusual after I have explained everything to you.</t1926> <t1927>Please believe that I am not among those young women who dare to gamble their happiness on the chance of a second proposal.</t1927> <t1928>I am entirely serious in my refusal.</t1928> <t1929>You cannot bring happiness to me, and I am certain I am not the last woman in this world who could make you happy.</t1929> <t1930>No, if Lady Catherine truly understood me, I believe she would see that I do not meet any of her standards.</t1930>
<t1931>Mr. Collins said, very solemnly:</t1931>
<t1932>- If Lady Catherine truly thinks that way, I cannot imagine that she would completely reject you.</t1932> <t1933>And please believe that when I have the honor of meeting her again, I will tell her in the most beautiful words about your humility, household economy skills, along with your other charming virtues.</t1933>
<t1934>- Mr. Collins, in fact, all your praises of me will be unnecessary.</t1934> <t1935>You should let me judge myself, and respect me by believing what I say.</t1935> <t1936>I wish you much happiness and wealth; by refusing you, I have done my best to prevent you from falling into the opposite situation.</t1936> <t1937>When you proposed to me, you must have satisfied your delicate feelings towards my family, so you can take possession of the Longbourn estate whenever possible without any self-reproach.</t1937> <t1938>Therefore, this matter can be considered concluded here.</t1938>
<t1939>As she spoke, she stood up and might have left the room if Mr. Collins had not continued speaking:</t1939>
<t1940>- When I have the honor of discussing this matter with you again, I hope to receive a more satisfactory answer than now; although I have no intention of accusing you of being cruel because I know it is customary for ladies to refuse a man the first time, perhaps; true to the delicacy of women, right now you have the intention of encouraging me to plead.</t1940>
<t1941>Elizabeth exclaimed, with little gentleness:</t1941>
<t1942>- Mr. Collins, you have indeed put me in a most awkward position.</t1942> <t1943>If anything I have said so far has implied that I encouraged you, then I do not know how to refuse in a way that you would believe to be sincere.</t1943>
<t1944>- My dear, you must allow me to feel gratified that your refusal is merely a matter of course.</t1944> <t1945>The reasons for my belief are quite simple.</t1945> <t1946>There seems to be no indication that I am unworthy of your acceptance, or that my status is insufficient.</t1946> <t1947>My circumstances, my connections with the De Bourgh family, and my relationship with your family are all highly advantageous for me; and you should also consider that although you have many charms, it is not certain that you will receive another proposal.</t1947> <t1948>Unfortunately, your dowry is too small for your beauty and other amiable qualities to have much effect.</t1948> <t1949>Since I must conclude that you are not serious in rejecting me, I can only believe that you wish for my love to grow deeper in suspense, as is often the way with elegant women.</t1949>
<t1950>- Sir, I beg you to believe that I had no intention of acting in such a refined manner when it truly only torments the spirit of a respectable man.</t1950> <t1951>Instead, I wish to be praised as a sincere person.</t1951> <t1952>I thank you and thank you again for the honor of your proposal, but I absolutely cannot accept it.</t1952> <t1953>My feelings in every aspect forbid this.</t1953> <t1954>Could I possibly be clearer than that?</t1954> <t1955>Now, please do not see me as a refined woman intending to distress you, but merely as a rational being who has spoken the truth from her heart.</t1955>
<t1956>He exclaimed, with a clumsy attempt at flattery:</t1956>
<t1957>- You are truly charming!</t1957> <t1958>I am convinced that when your dear parents agree, my proposal will be accepted.</t1958>
<t1959>Elizabeth did not respond to such deliberate self-deception and immediately walked away.</t1959> <t1960>She had firmly resolved that if the gentleman persisted in interpreting her refusals as encouragements and then felt compelled to appeal to her father, her father's rejection would be unequivocal, and his demeanor would at least not be misinterpreted as the emotional and affected manner of a refined lady.</t1960>
<t1961>Chapter 20</t1961>
<t1962>Mr. Collins was not allowed to remain quiet for long to contemplatively appreciate his successful courtship.</t1962> <t1963>Mrs. Bennet had been lingering in the hallway to see the conclusion of the conversation, and as soon as she saw Elizabeth open the door and walk out, quickly passing her towards the stairs, she entered the breakfast room and congratulated him and herself with gentle words on the prospect of a closer relationship between them.</t1963> <t1964>Mr. Collins received and reciprocated the congratulations with equal joy, then recounted to her the spirit of his exchange with Elizabeth, with the result that he believed he had every reason to be satisfied, as her refusal was merely a natural reaction of the true modesty, shyness, and delicacy in her character.</t1964>
<t1965>However, his words surprised Mrs. Bennet.</t1965> <t1966>She should have felt as happy as he did, believing that her daughter's refusal was meant to encourage him further, but she did not dare to believe this and had to speak out.</t1966>
<t1967>- Mr. Collins, but according to this matter, Lizzy needs to be explained.</t1967> <t1968>I will speak to her directly.</t1968> <t1969>She is a very stubborn and foolish girl who does not see the benefits for her; but I will make her see.</t1969>
<t1970>- I apologize for interrupting you, but if she truly is stubborn and foolish, I am not sure if she would be an ideal wife for someone in my situation, who seeks happiness in marriage.</t1970> <t1971>Therefore, if she genuinely rejects me, it might be better not to force her to accept me, because if she is against it, she cannot bring complete happiness to me.</t1971>
<t1972>Mrs. Bennet said, worried:</t1972>
<t1973>- Brother, you have misunderstood me.</t1973> <t1974>Lizzy is only stubborn in matters like this.</t1974> <t1975>In everything else, she is the most obedient.</t1975> <t1976>I will speak directly with her father, we will sort it out with her soon, I am sure of it.</t1976>
<t1977>She did not give him time to answer, hurriedly went to find her husband, and exclaimed as she entered the study:</t1977>
<t1978>- Dear, I need you right now, we are in turmoil.</t1978> <t1979>You must come and advise Lizzy to marry Mr. Collins, because she is determined not to marry him, and if you don't hurry, he will change his mind and won't want to marry her.</t1979>
<t1980>Mr. Bennet looked up from his book when she entered, gazing at her calmly without any sign of concern and without changing his demeanor as she spoke.</t1980> <t1981>When she finished speaking, he said:</t1981>
<t1982>- I don't understand what you mean.</t1982> <t1983>What are you talking about?</t1983>
<t1984>- The matter of Mr. Collins and Elizabeth.</t1984> <t1985>Lizzy declared that she would not accept Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins began to say that he would not want to marry Lizzy.</t1985>
<t1986>- What should I do in this situation?</t1986> <t1987>It seems like a hopeless matter.</t1987>
<t1988>- You must personally talk to Lizzy.</t1988> <t1989>Tell her that you want her to marry Mr. Collins.</t1989>
<t1990>- Call the little one down here.</t1990> <t1991>It will follow my opinion.</t1991>
<t1992>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the study.</t1992> <t1993>He called out as she appeared:</t1993>
<t1994>Come here, my child.</t1994> <t1995>Your father is calling you because there is something important.</t1995> <t1996>Your father heard that Mr. Collins has proposed to you.</t1996> <t1997>Is that true?</t1997>
<t1998>Elizabeth answered that it was true:</t1998>
<t1999>- Very well, and you turned down the proposal, didn't you?</t1999>
<t2000>- Yes, father.</t2000>
<t2001>- Very well.</t2001> <t2002>Now let's get to the point.</t2002> <t2003>Your mother wants you to agree.</t2003> <t2004>Isn't that right, dear?</t2004>
<t2005>- That's right, otherwise I would never see its face again.</t2005>
<t2006>- So, there is an unfortunate choice before you.</t2006> <t2007>Elizabeth.</t2007> <t2008>From this day forward, you will become a stranger to either your father or your mother.</t2008> <t2009>Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and your father will never see you again if you do.</t2009>
<t2010>Elizabeth could not suppress a smile upon hearing such a conclusion right at the beginning.</t2010> <t2011>But Mrs. Bennet was deeply disappointed because she had believed that her husband would agree with her.</t2011>
<t2012>- What do you mean by saying that? You promised me you would force the girl to marry him.</t2012>
<t2013>- Ma'am, I request two small favors from you.</t2013> <t2014>First: allow me the freedom to use my understanding of the matter, and second: to use the reading room.</t2014> <t2015>I would be very happy to continue reading as soon as possible.</t2015>
<t2016>However, despite being disappointed in her husband, she still did not give up her intention.</t2016> <t2017>She spoke with Elizabeth again, alternately advising and threatening her.</t2017> <t2018>She wanted Jane to side with her, but Jane refused with all possible gentleness, and Elizabeth responded to her attacks sometimes with genuine seriousness, sometimes with playful banter.</t2018> <t2019>Although her attitude varied, she always remained resolute.</t2019>
<t2020>Meanwhile, Mr. Collins was alone, pondering over what had happened.</t2020> <t2021>He thought too highly of himself to understand what could have motivated his cousin to reject him.</t2021> <t2022>Although his pride was wounded, he did not feel any other kind of distress.</t2022> <t2023>His feelings for her were merely the result of much imagination, and her situation of being scolded by her mother prevented any sense of regret in him.</t2023>
<t2024>While the family was still bustling, Charlotte Lucas came to visit them.</t2024> <t2025>In the hall, she met Lydia, who approached her and whispered:</t2025>
<t2026>- I'm glad to see you, because there's something amusing happening here.</t2026> <t2027>Do you know what happened this morning?</t2027> <t2028>Mr. Collins proposed to Elizabeth, and she did not accept.</t2028>
<t2029>While Charlotte did not have time to respond, Kitty went to inform her of the news.</t2029> <t2030>As soon as they entered the breakfast room, where Mrs. Bennet was sitting alone, she also began with the same matter, hoping Miss Lucas would sympathize with her, earnestly asking her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the family's wishes.</t2030> <t2031>She added, with a sorrowful voice:</t2031>
<t2032>- Miss Lucas, please help me because no one agrees with me, no one is on my side, I am being treated cruelly, no one sympathizes with my nerves.</t2032>
<t2033>While Charlotte had not yet had time to respond, Jane and Elizabeth both walked in.</t2033> <t2034>Mrs. Bennet continued:</t2034>
<t2035>- Ah, the young lady has arrived, it seems she doesn't care and no longer pays attention to us, as long as she can live her own way. But Miss Lizzy, let me tell you, if you keep stubbornly rejecting every proposal like this, you will never find a husband – and I don't know who will take care of you when your father passes away.</t2035> <t2036>I will not be able to take care of you – and I warn you about that.</t2036> <t2037>From today onwards, I will have nothing to do with you anymore.</t2037> <t2038>I told you in the reading room, you know, that I will never speak to you again, and you will see that I will do exactly as I said.</t2038> <t2039>I do not like talking to disobedient children.</t2039> <t2040>In fact, I do not like talking to anyone.</t2040> <t2041>People who are nervous wrecks like me do not like talking at all.</t2041> <t2042>No one can understand how much I suffer.</t2042> <t2043>But it is always like that.</t2043> <t2044>Those who do not complain are never understood.</t2044>
<t2045>In silence, the girls listened to their mother pouring out, knowing that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only make her more upset.</t2045> <t2046>Therefore, she continued without pause until Mr. Collins entered, looking more solemn than ever.</t2046> <t2047>As soon as she saw him, she said:</t2047>
<t2048>- Now, I want all of you to keep quiet so that Mr. Collins and I can have a little conversation.</t2048>
<t2049>Elizabeth silently stepped out of the room, Jane and Kitty following behind, but Lydia remained there, determined to hear everything.</t2049> <t2050>Charlotte stayed, firstly because Mr. Collins had politely inquired in detail about her and her family, and secondly out of a bit of curiosity, so she moved to the window and pretended not to be listening attentively.</t2050> <t2051>With a sorrowful voice, she began:</t2051>
<t2052>- Oh, Mr. Collins!</t2052>
<t2053>He replied:</t2053>
<t2054>- Madam, let us remain silent about this matter forever.</t2054>
<t2055>But he continued, with a dissatisfied tone:</t2055>
<t2056>- I am not at all disappointed by your daughter's attitude.</t2056><t2057>We have a duty to endure the unavoidable misfortunes; it is an unusual duty for a young man as fortunate as I am to have achieved success early, and I believe I can endure it.</t2057><t2058>Perhaps no less is the doubt about my happiness if your beautiful daughter agreed to marry me; because I often find that we cannot fully endure when a chance, after being rejected, starts to lose a bit of its value in the way we perceive it.</t2058><t2059>Madam, I hope you will not see me as having a disrespectful attitude towards your family when I withdraw my intentions towards your daughter, when I do not ask you and your husband to use your authority to intervene for me.</t2059><t2060>I am concerned that my manner might be unpleasant when I accept your daughter's refusal instead of yours.</t2060><t2061>But we all can make mistakes.</t2061><t2062>Surely, I have had good intentions throughout this matter.</t2062><t2063>My aim was to seek a charming life partner for myself with all considerations beneficial to your family, and if my attitude was blameworthy, I now ask you to forgive me.</t2063>
<t2064>Chapter 21</t2064>
<t2065>The debate over Mr. Collins' proposal had now nearly reached its conclusion, and Elizabeth felt miserable due to her discomfort in participating in the discussion, sometimes exacerbated by her mother's irritable insinuations.</t2065> <t2066>As for the gentleman, his feelings were expressed not so much through confusion or disappointment, or by avoiding her, but through a rigid and silently frustrated demeanor.</t2066> <t2067>He spoke very little to her, and subsequently, his diligent attentions were redirected to Miss Lucas.</t2067> <t2068>Her polite attentiveness in listening to him relieved everyone, especially her friend.</t2068>
<t2069>The days did not help alleviate Mrs. Bennet's vexation or her poor health.</t2069> <t2070>Mr. Collins shared the same prideful anger.</t2070> <t2071>Elizabeth had hoped that his distress would shorten his visit, but this did not affect his plans at all.</t2071> <t2072>He had always intended to leave on Saturday, so he decided to stay until Saturday.</t2072>
<t2073>After breakfast, the daughters walked to Meryton to see if Mr. Wickham had returned, and also to lament his absence at the Netherfield ball. He met them as they entered the town and accompanied them to their aunt's house.</t2073> <t2074>He spoke very eloquently about his regrets, his troubles, and the concern of everyone.</t2074> <t2075>However, with Elizabeth, he was willing to admit that he had felt it necessary to be absent.</t2075> <t2076>He said:</t2076>
<t2077>- When that day approached, I thought that I should not meet Mr. Darcy, that being present in the same room, at the same gathering for many hours with him was something I could not endure, while others might also be affected by the discomfort.</t2077>
<t2078>Accepting his endurance, and the two had leisurely time to discuss this matter in depth, also to compliment each other politely.</t2078> <t2079>When Wickham and another officer accompanied the ladies to Longbourn, he paid special attention to her.</t2079> <t2080>His accompanying had two advantages: she felt all the affection he had for her, and it was an opportunity for her to introduce him to her father and mother.</t2080>
<t2081>Not long after they returned, a letter from Netherfield was brought to Miss Bennet: she opened it immediately.</t2081> <t2082>The letter was written on a small, elegant piece of paper, with soft, feminine handwriting.</t2082> <t2083>Elizabeth noticed her sister's expression change as she read, and saw her read several passages over and over.</t2083> <t2084>Jane quickly returned to normal, put away the letter, and tried to join the conversation with her usual cheerfulness, but Elizabeth felt worried, which made her pay less attention even to Mr. Wickham.</t2084> <t2085>As soon as he and his friend took their leave, Jane's glance made her follow her sister up the stairs.</t2085> <t2086>When they entered her room, Jane took out the letter and said:</t2086>
<t2087>- This is a letter from Caroline Bingley; its contents have greatly surprised me.</t2087> <t2088>The whole family has now left Netherfield, on their way to the city, with no intention of returning.</t2088> <t2089>You will hear what she has to say.</t2089>
<t2090>Then she read the letter, the content of which said that they had just decided to follow Mr. Bingley to the city, and would have dinner that evening on Grosvernor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house.</t2090> <t2091>The next section read as follows:</t2091>
<t2092>"I do not want to pretend to regret anything when leaving Hertfordshire, except for the relationship with you, my dearest friend, but my family hopes that in the future it will be compensated by the friendship between us. For now, the pain of separation can be alleviated by frequent and heartfelt correspondence."</t2092> <t2093>"I hope you will agree to this."</t2093>
<t2094>Elizabeth listened to such passionate words with indifference due to suspicion, and although surprised by their sudden departure, she did not find this event tragic.</t2094> <t2095>It should not be assumed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley from staying.</t2095> <t2096>Regarding the loss of their acquaintance, she believed that soon Jane would no longer think about it, and then he would be happy about this.</t2096>
<t2097>Elizabeth said, after a few moments of thought:</t2097>
<t2098>- The unfortunate thing is that you couldn't meet your friends before they left.</t2098> <t2099>But can we hope, then, that the happy time Miss Bingley is expecting will come sooner?</t2099> <t2100>And the friendship between friends will quickly turn into a sister-in-law relationship?</t2100> <t2101>Mr. Bingley will not be detained by them in London.</t2101>
<t2102>- Caroline made it clear that no one in the family would return to Herfordshire this winter.</t2102> <t2103>She will read it to you:</t2103>
<t2104>"When my brother left yesterday, he thought that the job in London might be finished in three or four days, but we couldn't believe it. At the same time, we thought that once Charles was in the city, he wouldn't be in a hurry to leave, so we decided to follow him, so he wouldn't be alone in the uncomfortable hotel room."</t2104> <t2105>"Many of my acquaintances have gone there for the winter; I wish you, my closest friend, could join the crowd, but I'm not sure."</t2105> <t2106>"I sincerely wish you a Merry Christmas in Herfordshire, and you will have many suitors to help you forget the three of us."</t2106>
<t2107>Jane added:</t2107>
<t2108>- Clearly, he will not return this winter.</t2108>
<t2109>- I only see a clear intention that Miss Bingley implies he should not return.</t2109>
<t2110>- Why do you think that? This is something I have to decide for myself.</t2110> <t2111>He is the master of his own life.</t2111> <t2112>But you don't know everything.</t2112> <t2113>I will read to you the part of the letter that broke my heart.</t2113> <t2114>I won't hide anything from you.</t2114>
<t2115>“Mr. Darcy is eager to see his sister again, and to be honest, we are just as impatient to meet her.</t2115> <t2116>I truly think no one can compare to Georgiana Darcy in terms of appearance, elegance, and talent, and her affection for Louisa and me has grown into something more, in my bold hope that she will become my sister-in-law.</t2116> <t2117>I don't remember if I have mentioned my feelings about this to you before, but I will not leave without confiding in you, and I hope you won't find this too forward.</t2117> <t2118>My brother is very fond of her, and now he will have many opportunities to see her in the most intimate circumstances.</t2118> <t2119>Both her relatives and ours desire this relationship, and I believe that the partiality of a sister does not lead me astray in thinking that Charles has the ability to win the heart of any woman.</t2119> <t2120>With all such favorable circumstances for an attachment and nothing to prevent it, dear Jane, am I wrong to expect an event that ensures the happiness of many people?”</t2120>
<t2121>Jane said, when she finished reading:</t2121>
<t2122>- What do you think about this, Lizzy?</t2122> <t2123>Is the meaning clear enough?</t2123> <t2124>Does it mean that Caroline neither expects nor hopes that you will become her sister-in-law?</t2124> <t2125>That she is certain he is indifferent to you?</t2125> <t2126>And if she has guessed your feelings towards him, would she intend to warn you?</t2126> <t2127>Do you have any thoughts?</t2127>
<t2128>- Yes, because my opinion is completely different.</t2128> <t2129>Do you want to hear it?</t2129>
<t2130>- Of course, I want to.</t2130>
<t2131>- You can listen briefly. Miss Bingley thought that her brother was in love with you, while she wanted him to marry Miss Darcy.</t2131> <t2132>She followed him in hopes of keeping him there, trying to convince you that he didn't care about you.</t2132>
<t2133>Jane shook her head.</t2133>
<t2134>- Actually, Jane, you should trust me.</t2134> <t2135>No one who has ever seen the two of you together would doubt his feelings for you.</t2135> <t2136>I'm sure Miss Bingley doesn't either.</t2136> <t2137>She's not foolish.</t2137> <t2138>If she could recognize that Mr. Darcy loved her even half as much, she would have already ordered her wedding dress.</t2138> <t2139>But here's the issue.</t2139> <t2140>We are neither wealthy nor have any status for them to look forward to; while her sister keeps trying to pair Miss Darcy with him, with the idea that once there is a marriage between the two families, she could easily secure a second marriage.</t2140> <t2141>This calculation is quite clever; I'm sure it could succeed if not for Lady De Bourgh's interference.</t2141> <t2142>But, dear Jane, you shouldn't seriously imagine that just because Miss Bingley tells you he admires Miss Darcy, he will think less of you than he did when he left on Tuesday, or that she has the ability to persuade him to love her friend instead of you.</t2142>
<t2143>Jane replied:</t2143>
<t2144>- If we had the same thoughts as Miss Bingley, everything you said might help put my mind at ease.</t2144> <t2145>But I think that is unfounded.</t2145> <t2146>Caroline cannot be capable of deceiving anyone; in this matter, all I can hope is that she has merely deceived herself.</t2146>
<t2147>- That's right. You can't think of anything better to make you happy, because you can't be happy with my words.</t2147> <t2148>Believe that she has deceived herself.</t2148> <t2149>As for you, it's over with her, you shouldn't be sad anymore.</t2149>
<t2150>- But, my dear, can I be happy, even in the best case, to accept a young man whose siblings and friends all want him to marry someone else?</t2150>
<t2151>Elizabeth said:</t2151>
<t2152>- You must decide for yourself, and if after careful consideration, you find that the distress of displeasing the two sisters outweighs the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.</t2152>
<t2153>Jane smiled softly:</t2153>
<t2154>- How can you say that? You must know that although I might be very sad because they don't accept me, I cannot hesitate.</t2154>
<t2155>- I didn't think you would hesitate, and in such a case, I cannot have compassion for your situation.</t2155>
<t2156>- But if he doesn't come back in the winter, you will never have to choose anything at all.</t2156> <t2157>Thousands of things can happen in six months.</t2157>
<t2158>The thought that he would not return made Elizabeth utterly contemptuous.</t2158> <t2159>She thought that it seemed merely to be Caroline's self-serving wish; she did not believe that these wishes, whether expressed bluntly or subtly, could influence a man as independent as he was.</t2159>
<t2160>She expressed her feelings as strongly as she could, immediately seeing that her sister was very happy.</t2160> <t2161>Jane's attitude was not one of discouragement, and she gradually began to hope that Bingley would return to Netherfield and reciprocate her feelings.</t2161>
<t2162>The two sisters agreed to inform Mrs. Bennet about the family's departure without alarming her about the young man's attitude, but even this news caused her considerable worry, and she lamented her misfortune excessively, as if they were her close relatives.</t2162> <t2163>However, she soon consoled herself with the thought that Mr. Bingley would return shortly and would come to dine at Longbourn.</t2163> <t2164>Everyone felt happy, even though they were inviting him to a regular family meal, but she would prepare a lavish feast.</t2164>
<t2165>Chapter 22</t2165>
<t2166>The Bennet family was invited to dine with the Lucas family, and once again Miss Charlotte Lucas spent most of the time politely listening to Mr. Collins.</t2166> <t2167>Elizabeth took the opportunity to express her gratitude to her.</t2167>
<t2168>- You have made him happy, thank you very much.</t2168>
<t2169>Charlotte reassured her friend that she was happy to be of help, thinking she had used her time meaningfully.</t2169> <t2170>This was truly sweet, but Charlotte's kindness had gone beyond what Elizabeth imagined – her goal was nothing less than to gain Mr. Collins' attention.</t2170> <t2171>That was her intention, and everything appeared so favorable that when they parted that night, she could almost certainly think she had succeeded if he did not have to leave Hertfordshire soon.</t2171> <t2172>But in this matter, she had not accurately assessed his courage and self-control, for he left Longbourn the next morning, hastily heading to Lucas Lodge to court her.</t2172> <t2173>He did not want his cousins to see him, fearing that if they saw him leave, they would immediately guess his intention, which he did not want anyone to know until he was certain of the outcome.</t2173> <t2174>He was right to be worried, for although Charlotte had encouraged him to proceed, he lacked confidence after the adventure on Wednesday.</t2174> <t2175>However, the way she welcomed him made him truly satisfied.</t2175> <t2176>As he was approaching the house, Miss Lucas had seen him from an upstairs window, immediately went outside, pretending to meet him by chance on the path.</t2176> <t2177>But she did not dare hope that so much affection and eloquence awaited her there.</t2177>
<t2178>In the short period of time that Mr. Collins' lengthy speeches allowed, everything was arranged to the satisfaction of both parties.</t2178> <t2179>When the two entered the house, he warmly asked her to set a date that would make him the happiest young man.</t2179> <t2180>Although she could not give an answer at that moment, the young lady did not want to downplay his delight.</t2180> <t2181>His naturally foolish demeanor made his courtship lack the compelling force that women wish to continue.</t2181> <t2182>Miss Lucas, having accepted him with pure and selfless intentions regarding the relationship, did not care how quickly the relationship was established.</t2182>
<t2183>They quickly expressed to Mr. Williams and Lady Lucas, both of whom accepted with the most eager cheerfulness.</t2183> <t2184>Mr. Collins's current situation made him the most eligible match for their daughter, as they could only provide her with a small fortune, and his future prospects were very bright.</t2184> <t2185>Lady Lucas began to calculate with unprecedented attention the number of years Mr. Bennet would still live.</t2185> <t2186>Sir William decided that when Mr. Collins inherited the Longbourn estate, both he and his wife would appear at St. James's Court.</t2186> <t2187>The whole family seemed delighted.</t2187> <t2188>The younger daughters hoped they might come out a year or two sooner than expected, while the sons were relieved that Charlotte would not die an old maid.</t2188> <t2189>Charlotte herself was quite composed.</t2189> <t2190>She had achieved her goal and had time to think about it.</t2190> <t2191>Her reflections were all satisfactory.</t2191> <t2192>It was evident that Mr. Collins was neither sensible nor agreeable; his manners were awkward, and his attachment to her was imaginary.</t2192> <t2193>But still, he would be her husband.</t2193> <t2194>Not thinking highly of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her objective.</t2194> <t2195>It was the most dignified provision for well-educated young women of small fortune; and though uncertain of bringing happiness, it was the most pleasant preservative from want.</t2195> <t2196>Now that this preservative was secured, and at the age of twenty-seven, without being handsome, she felt fortunate.</t2196> <t2197>The most uncomfortable feeling was Elizabeth Bennet's surprise, whose friendship she valued more than any other person's.</t2197> <t2198>Elizabeth might wonder, perhaps reproach her; and though her opinion was resolute, she might feel hurt by her friend's disapproval.</t2198> <t2199>Charlotte decided to inform her friend herself, so when Mr. Collins returned to Longbourn for dinner, she requested him to withhold the news.</t2199> <t2200>Of course, he promised secrecy, but it was not easy, as everyone was curious about his absence and questioned him directly.</t2200> <t2201>He had to be very skillful in evading, while he himself was eager to announce his prosperous love affair.</t2201>
<t2202>Because he would leave too early the next day to say goodbye to anyone, they had a farewell ceremony that night.</t2202> <t2203>With utmost politeness and warmth, Mrs. Bennet said she would be very pleased to welcome him again at Longbourn whenever he had the chance to visit.</t2203> <t2204>He replied:</t2204>
<t2205>- Madam, I am very excited to be invited, as I have always hoped to receive such an invitation, and you can be sure that I will accept it as soon as possible.</t2205>
<t2206>The whole family was surprised.</t2206> <t2207>They never thought there would be such a quick response.</t2207> <t2208>Mr. Bennet immediately said:</t2208>
<t2209>- But will Lady Catherine object, dear?</t2209> <t2210>Should you forget your own relatives instead of displeasing your benefactor?</t2210>
<t2211>Mr. Collins replied:</t2211>
<t2212>- Sir, I am particularly very pleased that you have reminded me so sincerely, and please believe me that I will not do anything without the lady's approval.</t2212>
<t2213>- Anyway, you should be more careful.</t2213> <t2214>You can afford to lose everything, but you should not offend the lady.</t2214> <t2215>I believe you might want to visit us again, but if this matter displeases her, I think you should not come, and please rest assured, we will not hold it against you.</t2215>
<t2216>- Sir, please believe me, I am deeply grateful for such heartfelt concern, and I will write you a thank-you letter for this concern, as well as for what I received during my stay in Hertfordshire.</t2216> <t2217>As for my lovely cousins, although my absence will not be long and there is no need for many well-wishes, I still wish them health and happiness, including Miss Elizabeth.</t2217>
<t2218>With all due politeness, the women went outside; everyone was surprised to see that he planned to return soon.</t2218> <t2219>From this, Mrs. Bennet hoped he would want to get acquainted with one of her young daughters, and Mary in particular might be willing to accept him.</t2219> <t2220>She had rated him higher than the other girls did.</t2220> <t2221>She often had a good impression of his way of thinking, which she considered mature.</t2221> <t2222>Although he was not as wise as she was, she thought that if he were encouraged to read more and be as self-improving as she was, he could become a pleasant life partner.</t2222> <t2223>But the next morning, all hopes were dashed.</t2223> <t2224>Miss Lucas visited after breakfast, and during a private conversation with Elizabeth, recounted the events of the previous day.</t2224>
<t2225>The possibility that Mr. Collins might fall for her friend had crossed Elizabeth's mind in the past few days, but the idea that Charlotte could encourage him seemed as unlikely as she herself encouraging him.</t2225> <t2226>Therefore, she was so extremely surprised that she forgot all manners and couldn't help but exclaim:</t2226>
<t2227>- Engaged to Mr. Collins!</t2227> <t2228>Dear Charlotte, that cannot be!</t2228>
<t2229>The calm expression on Miss Lucas's face as she recounted her story gave way to confusion due to such a straightforward reaction, although it was not unexpected.</t2229> <t2230>But she quickly composed herself and replied:</t2230>
<t2231>- Dear Elizabeth, why are you surprised?</t2231> <t2232>Do you think it is unbelievable that Mr. Collins could win over another woman because he was not happy after failing to win you?</t2232>
<t2233>But Elizabeth had calmed down, trying her best to reassure her friend that she was very happy to see the prospect of a union between the two, and she wished them all happiness.</t2233> <t2234>Charlotte replied:</t2234>
<t2235>- I understand what you are thinking.</t2235> <t2236>You must be surprised, very surprised to hear that Mr. Collins wants to marry me.</t2236> <t2237>But when you have had time to think, I hope you will be satisfied with my decision. I have never been imprudent, you know.</t2237> <t2238>I just want a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins' character, connections, and social status, I am confident that I will be happy with him, as most people entering into marriage can boast.</t2238>
<t2239>Elizabeth replied gently:</t2239>
<t2240>- Certainly.</t2240>
<t2241>After a moment of confusion, both of them went back in with the family.</t2241> <t2242>Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth had time to think about what she had heard.</t2242> <t2243>It took her a while to come to terms with the idea of such an ill-matched marriage.</t2243> <t2244>That Mr. Collins proposed twice in three days was odd, but even odder was that he was accepted.</t2244> <t2245>She had always thought Charlotte's views on marriage were exactly like her own, but she could not imagine that when it came to a decision, her friend would sacrifice all feelings to gain worldly advantage.</t2245> <t2246>Charlotte, the wife of Mr. Collins, was indeed a humiliating image! In the pain of seeing a friend degrade herself and lose respect, there was also the sorrow from the certain thought that her friend could not be happy with the man she had chosen.</t2246>
<t2247>Chapter 23</t2247>
<t2248>While Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and siblings, thinking about what she had heard and wondering if she was allowed to reveal this matter</t2248>
<t2249>As it happened, Sir William Lucas appeared, having been sent by his daughter to announce her engagement.</t2249> <t2250>With congratulations for them and greater self-satisfaction about an alliance between the two families, he proclaimed the news.</t2250> <t2251>Everyone was not only puzzled but also found it hard to believe.</t2251> <t2252>Out of stubbornness rather than politeness, Mrs. Bennet insisted that he must be mistaken.</t2252> <t2253>Lydia, always unreserved and seldom polite, exclaimed loudly:</t2253>
<t2254>- My God! Mr. Williams, how could you tell such a story? Do you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?</t2254>
<t2255>Only the magnanimity of a nobleman could restrain the anger from such a statement.</t2255> <t2256>But Sir William's good education helped him overcome it; and although he confirmed that the news was true, he still listened to all their insolence with the utmost polite forbearance.</t2256>
<t2257>Elizabeth thought she needed to help him get out of the uncomfortable situation.</t2257> <t2258>She confirmed his words by recounting what she had heard Charlotte announce.</t2258> <t2259>She tried to end her mother's and sisters' complaints with warm congratulations to Sir William, which Jane also joined in, and with a few remarks about the happiness the union would bring, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance between Hunsford and London.</t2259>
<t2260>Mrs. Bennet was too overwhelmed to say much in Sir William's presence; but as soon as he took his leave, she poured out her feelings.</t2260> <t2261>First, she still stubbornly refused to believe the entire affair; second, she was convinced that Mr. Collins had been ensnared; third, she believed that the two would not be happy together; and fourth, the marriage could fall apart.</t2261> <t2262>However, she drew two conclusions: first, Elizabeth was the sole cause of all the turmoil; and second, she herself had been cruelly exploited by them.</t2262> <t2263>She carried these two points in her mind throughout the entire day.</t2263> <t2264>Nothing could console her and nothing could reason with her.</t2264> <t2265>Her frustration did not subside in a day.</t2265> <t2266>It took a week before she stopped scolding Elizabeth every time she saw her.</t2266> <t2267>It took a month before she could speak to Sir William or Mrs. Lucas without rudeness, and many months before she could forgive their daughter.</t2267>
<t2268>Mr. Bennet was more composed, as this matter amused him to see Charlotte Lucas, whom he had thought to have quite a bit of judgment, turn out to be as foolish as his wife, and even more foolish than his own daughter!</t2268>
<t2269>In her heart, Jane was somewhat surprised by the marriage, but she spoke more about her wishes for the couple's happiness than about her own surprise; and Elizabeth could not convince her sister that this could not happen.</t2269> <t2270>Kitty and Lydia had nothing to envy Miss Lucas for, as Mr. Collins was merely a clergyman; this marriage only served as gossip material for them in Meryton.</t2270>
<t2271>Lady Lucas could not avoid feeling a sense of triumph when she retaliated against Mrs. Bennet by having her daughter secure a good marriage.</t2271> <t2272>She visited Longbourn more frequently than before to express her joy, even though the bitter looks and nasty remarks should have been strong enough to dispel her happiness.</t2272>
<t2273>Elizabeth and Charlotte showed restraint, causing both to remain silent about the matter; Elizabeth, in particular, realized that they could no longer share intimate thoughts with each other.</t2273> <t2274>The disappointment in Charlotte made her turn back to feeling compassion for her sister.</t2274> <t2275>Her thoughts on her sister's propriety and sensitivity had not changed; she grew increasingly worried about her sister's happiness, as Mr. Bingley had been gone for a week without any news.</t2275>
<t2276>Jane sent a reply letter to Caroline, waiting each day to receive more news.</t2276> <t2277>The thank-you letter that Mr. Collins had promised arrived on the third day, signed by his father, expressing gratitude as if he had stayed with them for the past 12 months.</t2277> <t2278>After settling his conscience on this matter, with fervent words he continued to write about his happiness at being favored by their charming neighbor, Miss Lucas.</t2278> <t2279>He explained that it was only because he wanted to be near her that he would accept their kind wish to see him again at Longbourn.</t2279> <t2280>He hoped to return the following Monday, as Lady Catherine had warmly approved the marriage and wished for it to proceed as soon as possible, so he believed his dear Charlotte would agree to set a date so that he could soon become the happiest young man.</t2280>
<t2281>Mr. Collins's return to Hertfordshire was no longer a joy for Mrs. Bennet.</t2281> <t2282>On the contrary, she constantly complained just like he did.</t2282> <t2283>It was strange, inconvenient, and extremely bothersome that he came to Longbourn instead of Lucas Lodge.</t2283> <t2284>She hated having guests in the house when her health was not good, and she found that among humanity, those in love were the hardest to endure.</t2284> <t2285>These were her whispered complaints, made even more miserable by Mr. Bingley's prolonged absence.</t2285>
<t2286>Both Jane and Elizabeth felt uneasy about this absence.</t2286> <t2287>Each day passed without any encouraging news about him, except for the rumor at Netherfields that he would not return throughout the winter.</t2287> <t2288>Mrs. Bennet was extremely angry about this news, constantly refuting it as the most malicious falsehood.</t2288>
<t2289>Even Elizabeth had begun to fear – not that Mr. Bingley was indifferent – but that his sisters might have succeeded in keeping him away.</t2289> <t2290>Even though she did not want to accept such a harmful idea for Jane's happiness and such a disgraceful one for her sister's suitor's constancy, the idea still lingered in her mind.</t2290> <t2291>She feared that the unfeeling efforts of the two sisters and the strong-willed friend, along with the charming allure of Miss Darcy and the pleasures of London, might exceed the strength of his affections.</t2291>
<t2292>As for Jane, her anxiety in uncertainty was even more painful than the fear in Elizabeth.</t2292> <t2293>But no matter what she thought, she still wanted to hide it, so she and Elizabeth never brought up the issue. However, such delicacy could not restrain their mother.</t2293> <t2294>Not an hour passed without her mentioning Mr. Bingley, expressing eagerness to see him return, or even forcing Jane to acknowledge that if he did not come back, she should consider herself used.</t2294> <t2295>Jane had to muster all her gentle firmness to calmly withstand these attacks.</t2295>
<t2296>Mr. Collins returned on Monday as announced, but Longbourn did not welcome him as warmly as the first time.</t2296> <t2297>However, he was too delighted to feel the need for much attention, and fortunately for the others, his preoccupations with seeking love spared them from the burden of his close presence.</t2297> <t2298>He spent most of each day at Lucas Lodge; sometimes he returned to Longbourn only to apologize for his absence before the household went to bed.</t2298>
<t2299>Mrs. Bennet was truly in the most pitiable situation.</t2299> <t2300>Just a mention of the marriage was enough to cause her agony, and wherever she went, she heard talk of it.</t2300> <t2301>She loathed the presence of Miss Lucas, who would inherit the house.</t2301> <t2302>Whenever Charlotte visited, she thought she was preparing to take over the house; whenever she whispered with Mr. Collins, she believed they were discussing the Longbourn estate, determined to expel her and her daughters from the house as soon as Mr. Bennet passed away.</t2302> <t2303>She bitterly complained about this to her husband.</t2303>
<t2304>- Actually, sir, it is hard to believe that Charlotte Lucas would become the mistress of this house, that I would have to give up my place to her, and then live to see her take over my position.</t2304>
<t2305>- Ma'am, you shouldn't harbor such dark thoughts.</t2305> <t2306>We should hope for better things.</t2306> <t2307>We should boast that I might be the one who survives.</t2307>
<t2308>This did not appease Mrs. Bennet, so instead of replying, she continued:</t2308>
<t2309>- I can't bear the thought that they will take all of this property.</t2309> <t2310>If it weren't for the inheritance, I wouldn't care at all.</t2310>
<t2311>- She doesn't care about anything?</t2311>
<t2312>- I don't care about anything.</t2312>
<t2313>- Grandma, if you are as healthy as that, then we should be happy.</t2313>
<t2314>- I never rejoice over an inheritance.</t2314> <t2315>How can a person with a conscience want to inherit and take away the property of their own daughters is something I cannot understand, all because of Mr. Collins.</t2315> <t2316>Why does he get more than others?</t2316>
<t2317>- I will leave it to you to answer.</t2317>
<t2318>Chapter 24</t2318>
<t2319>Miss Bingley's letter ended all doubts.</t2319> <t2320>In the very first sentence, she confirmed that they would stay in London, and the concluding sentence expressed that her brother regretted not having had the time to visit his friends in Hertfordshire before leaving.</t2320>
<t2321>Hope had vanished, completely vanished.</t2321> <t2322>When Jane read the rest of the letter, she found little more to comfort her, except for the affection the writer had wished to express.</t2322> <t2323>The letter praised Miss Darcy a lot, about her attractive features.</t2323> <t2324>Caroline cheerfully talked about the growing bond between the two, predicting that the hopes mentioned in the previous letter might come true.</t2324> <t2325>She enthusiastically wrote about her brother becoming close with the Darcy family, excitedly mentioning some issues regarding the interior upgrades in this family.</t2325>
<t2326>Elizabeth listened to this in silent disdain.</t2326> <t2327>Her mind was torn between worry for her sister and resentment towards everyone else.</t2327> <t2328>She did not believe Caroline's words about her brother falling for Miss Darcy. She did not doubt that he genuinely admired Jane.</t2328> <t2329>Although she always liked him, she could not help but feel a mix of anger and slight contempt for such an easy-going nature, for the lack of decisiveness that made him a slave to his scheming relatives, causing him to sacrifice his own happiness to please them.</t2329> <t2330>However, if his happiness was the only sacrifice, he could be allowed to be generous in the way he thought best; but since this involved her sister, she thought he ought to have been more sensitive.</t2330> <t2331>This was what troubled her; she could think of nothing else.</t2331> <t2332>Yet whether his feelings had faded or were suppressed by the interference of others, whether he could understand that Jane loved him or he did not recognize this affection, in any case—though her opinion of him varied accordingly, her sister's situation remained the same, her own peace was equally disturbed.</t2332>
<t2333>After a few days and only when the Bennet family allowed the two to be alone following a series of frustrations about Netherfield, Jane finally had the courage to confide in Elizabeth.</t2333>
<t2334>- Ah! The fact that our mother couldn't keep her composure, she doesn't understand that she has caused you so much pain by constantly bringing him up.</t2334> <t2335>But you won't be upset.</t2335> <t2336>It won't last long, you will forget him and we will go back to how we were before.</t2336>
<t2337>Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredible concern, but said nothing.</t2337> <t2338>Jane exclaimed, her face slightly flushed:</t2338>
<t2339>- I suspect you; in fact, I have no reason to suspect you.</t2339> <t2340>He may reign in your thoughts as the most charming person among those you know, but that's all. You have nothing to hope for or worry about, and nothing to blame him for.</t2340> <t2341>Thank God! You haven't felt such pain.</t2341> <t2342>Just a short time, and you will feel better.</t2342>
<t2343>Raising her voice, she added:</t2343>
<t2344>- You have the immediate consolation that all of this is due to your small share of arbitrariness, but this does not harm anyone except yourself.</t2344>
<t2345>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t2345>
<t2346>- Sister Jane! You are so kind.</t2346> <t2347>You are gentle and carefree like an angel.</t2347> <t2348>I don't know how to express this to you.</t2348> <t2349>I feel that I have misunderstood you, or have not loved you as you deserve to be loved.</t2349>
<t2350>Jane refused to accept any compliments and instead complimented her sister.</t2350>
<t2351>Elizabeth said:</t2351>
<t2352>- No, that's not fair at all.</t2352> <t2353>You want to think well of everyone and feel hurt if I think badly of someone.</t2353> <t2354>I just want to think of you as a perfect person, but you have denied it.</t2354> <t2355>Don't worry that I will go astray, or that I will infringe on your privilege of goodwill. You don't have to worry.</t2355> <t2356>The number of people I truly care about is very few; the number of people I think well of is even fewer.</t2356> <t2357>The more I look at the world, the more dissatisfied I feel.</t2357> <t2358>Each passing day reinforces my belief in the indomitable nature of human character, and that value or personal consciousness depends on outward appearances.</t2358> <t2359>Later, I encountered two cases; one doesn't need to be mentioned, the other is Charlotte's marriage.</t2359> <t2360>It cannot be justified! From every angle, it cannot be justified!</t2360>
<t2361>- Dear Lizzy, you shouldn't be so extreme in your feelings like that, otherwise you won't be happy.</t2361> <t2362>You haven't tolerated the difference between reality and emotions.</t2362> <t2363>Consider the respectable position of Mr. Collins and the prudent, steadfast character of Charlotte.</t2363> <t2364>Think about it; she is the daughter in a large family, materially this is a suitable marriage.</t2364> <t2365>For everyone's sake, you should believe that she has some feelings, such as affection and respect for our cousin.</t2365>
<t2366>- To please you, I will try to believe almost everything, but no one else benefits from such belief, because I know if Collins loves her, I would despise her understanding even more than I currently disregard her feelings.</t2366> <t2367>Jane, Collins is an arrogant, ostentatious, narrow-minded, foolish person; you know this as well as I do. You must also think as I do, that any woman who wants to marry him cannot have sound judgment.</t2367> <t2368>You should not defend anyone, even if it is Charlotte Lucas.</t2368> <t2369>You should not change the meaning of principles and integrity for the sake of an individual, nor should you try to convince yourself or me that selfishness means prudence, and indifference to danger means the pursuit of happiness.</t2369>
<t2370>Jane replied:</t2370>
<t2371>- I think you have gone too far in your thoughts about the two people; I hope you truly believe me by seeing them live in happiness.</t2371> <t2372>But that is enough.</t2372> <t2373>You are alluding to something else.</t2373> <t2374>You are talking about two cases. I cannot misunderstand you, but I beg you, dear Lizzy, please do not break my heart by reproaching that person and by thinking lowly of them.</t2374> <t2375>We should not dwell on the thought that we are hurt intentionally.</t2375> <t2376>We cannot expect a young, lively man to always be meticulous and cautious.</t2376> <t2377>Very often, it is our own frivolity that has deceived us.</t2377> <t2378>Women often speculate about love more than its true nature.</t2378>
<t2379>- And men want us to be like that.</t2379>
<t2380>- If it's true, then this is precisely the reason you can't justify yourself; but you don't know that there are many schemes in this world as some people have imagined.</t2380>
<t2381>Elizabeth said:</t2381>
<t2382>- I do not attribute any part of Mr. Bingley's attitude to malice, but even without the intention to do harm or cause distress, it can still be a mistake, it can still be painful.</t2382> <t2383>Everything could be due to thoughtlessness, or a lack of consideration for others' feelings, or a lack of resolve.</t2383>
<t2384>- And you want to blame one of these things, don't you?</t2384>
<t2385>- That's right, for the last thing.</t2385> <t2386>But if you continue, you will upset me by saying what you think about the people I value.</t2386> <t2387>Please stop me here.</t2387>
<t2388>- So you still think that his sisters influence him, don't you?</t2388>
<t2389>- Yes, in collusion with his friend.</t2389>
<t2390>- She couldn't believe it.</t2390> <t2391>Why did they have to try so hard to influence him?</t2391> <t2392>They just wanted him to be happy, and if he stayed with her, no woman could be happy with him.</t2392>
<t2393>- Your first argument is incorrect.</t2393> <t2394>They may desire many things besides happiness.</t2394> <t2395>They may want you to be wealthier, to have more status; they may want you to marry a girl with high financial standing, elite connections, and pride.</t2395>
<t2396>Jane replied:</t2396>
<t2397>- Certainly. They all want you to choose Miss Darcy, but perhaps this is out of goodwill rather than what I guess.</t2397> <t2398>They have known her for a longer time than they have known you; it's not surprising if they like her more.</t2398> <t2399>But, whatever their intentions might be, there is no reason they would go against your brother's wishes.</t2399> <t2400>What sibling would think they have the full right to do so, except if there is something very reprehensible?</t2400> <t2401>If they still believed that he cared for you, they would not try to separate you; if he truly loved you, they could not succeed.</t2401> <t2402>When I assume such love, I make everyone's actions seem abnormal and wrong, which makes you the saddest.</t2402> <t2403>Don't make yourself sad with this thought.</t2403> <t2404>I'm not ashamed of having been mistaken – or at least this mistake is minor, not comparable to thinking ill of him or his sisters.</t2404> <t2405>Let me endure it in the best way, a way that everyone can sympathize with.</t2405>
<t2406>Elizabeth could not resist such a desire, and from this moment on they rarely mentioned the name Bingley.</t2406>
<t2407>Mrs. Bennet continued to worry and fret about him not returning, although there wasn't a day that Elizabeth didn't notice this, it seemed she had little chance to think and be less bewildered.</t2407> <t2408>Her eldest daughter tried to persuade her of something she herself didn't believe, that when he paid attention to her, it was merely the result of ordinary and temporary admiration, which would fade away when he no longer saw her. Although she also recognized that this might be true, she still had only one thing to repeat every day.</t2408> <t2409>Mrs. Bennet's only consolation was that Mr. Bingley would return in the summer.</t2409>
<t2410>Mr. Bennet viewed the matter differently.</t2410> <t2411>One day, he said:</t2411>
<t2412>- So, Lizzy, I see your sister has encountered a setback in love.</t2412> <t2413>I'm glad for her.</t2413> <t2414>Apart from marriage, a young woman likes to occasionally face obstacles in love.</t2414> <t2415>This is something to ponder, making her distinct from others.</t2415> <t2416>When will it be your turn? You can hardly stand for your sister Jane to surpass you.</t2416> <t2417>Now it's your turn.</t2417> <t2418>There are enough officers in Meryton to disappoint every girl in the area.</t2418> <t2419>Choose Wickham as your man.</t2419> <t2420>He is charming and will reliably let you down.</t2420>
<t2421>- Thank you, Dad, but a less pleasant person would also make me happy.</t2421> <t2422>None of us should rely on luck like Jane.</t2422>
<t2423>- That's right, but there's some comfort in thinking that, no matter what happens to you, you still have a loving mother who always knows how to take advantage of the situation.</t2423>
<t2424>The relationship with Mr. Wickham had the effect of dispelling any gloom in the Longbourn household.</t2424> <t2425>They often met with him.</t2425> <t2426>Now, additional impressions of him included his unreserved attitude.</t2426> <t2427>Everything Elizabeth had heard, the things he told about Darcy, and all that he had to endure because of Darcy, were now openly discussed and acknowledged; everyone was happy to think that they had always had a dislike for Mr. Darcy even before they knew about any issues between the two of them.</t2427>
<t2428>Mrs. Bennet was still the only creature who thought that there might be mitigating circumstances in the matter that the people of Hertfordshire were unaware of.</t2428> <t2429>Her gentle and steadfast frankness always called for forgiveness and tried to persuade a possibility of misunderstanding – but to everyone else, Mr. Darcy was still condemned as the worst person.</t2429>
<t2430>Chapter 25</t2430>
<t2431>After a week of expressing affection and contemplating happiness, Mr. Collins was called back on Sunday.</t2431> <t2432>However, the sadness of parting this time could be alleviated for him by the preparations for welcoming the bride.</t2432> <t2433>He had reason to hope that, upon his next return to Hertfordshire, they would set a date for him to become the happiest young man in the world.</t2433> <t2434>He bid farewell to his relatives at Longbourn with the same formal words as before; he wished his lovely cousins health and happiness, and promised Mr. Bennet to send a thank-you letter.</t2434>
<t2435>On the following day, Mrs. Bennet joyfully welcomed her brother and his wife to stay at Longbourn for Christmas.</t2435> <t2436>Mr. Gardiner was a sensitive, refined man, surpassing his sister in both character and education.</t2436> <t2437>The ladies of Netherfield might find it hard to believe that someone who made his living through commerce and lived near warehouses could possess such a level of sophistication and pleasant demeanor.</t2437> <t2438>Mrs. Gardiner, a few years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was a charming, intelligent, and elegant woman, dearly loved by all the young ladies of Longbourn.</t2438> <t2439>There was a very special affection between the two sisters and Mrs. Gardiner.</t2439> <t2440>They often stayed with her in the city.</t2440>
<t2441>The first thing Mrs. Gardiner did upon arrival was to distribute the gifts and describe the new fashion styles.</t2441> <t2442>Once finished, she didn't have much else to do; it was her turn to listen.</t2442> <t2443>Mrs. Bennet had many things to complain about.</t2443> <t2444>Everyone had been treated poorly since the last time the sisters met.</t2444>
<t2445>The two daughters had come close to marriage, but in the end, they got nothing. Mrs. Bennet continued:</t2445>
<t2446>- I do not blame Jane, for Jane would have taken Mr. Bingley if she could.</t2446> <t2447>But Lizzy!</t2447> <t2448>Oh! It is so distressing to think that she could have been Mr. Collins's wife by now, if she had not been so headstrong.</t2448> <t2449>He proposed to her right in this room, but she refused.</t2449> <t2450>As a result, Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before mine, and the Longbourn estate will continue to be inherited as before.</t2450> <t2451>The Lucases are really very cunning people, my dear.</t2451> <t2452>They want to seize everything they can.</t2452> <t2453>I regret to speak of them this way, but it is the truth.</t2453> <t2454>This makes me very anxious and unwell, being thwarted in my own family, and having neighbors who think only of themselves first.</t2454> <t2455>However, you coming at this moment is a great comfort to me, and I am very glad to hear your opinion.</t2455>
<t2456>Through Jane and Elizabeth's letters, Mrs. Gardiner had some knowledge of the matter.</t2456> <t2457>She only responded briefly, and out of compassion for her nieces, she steered the conversation in a different direction.</t2457>
<t2458>When sitting alone with Elizabeth, she further discussed the matter.</t2458> <t2459>She said:</t2459>
<t2460>- It seems that Jane could have had a desirable marriage.</t2460> <t2461>Your aunt feels very sad because this did not happen.</t2461> <t2462>But such things are common!</t2462> <t2463>A young man, as you described Mr. Bingley, falls in love with a beautiful girl so easily within a few weeks, and when an incident forces him to be away from her, he forgets her just as easily. Such inconsistencies happen very often.</t2463>
<t2464>Elizabeth said:</t2464>
<t2465>- You are very good at comforting, but it doesn't help us.</t2465> <t2466>We are not suffering because of the incident.</t2466> <t2467>It is not common for close relatives to intervene to persuade a young man with independent means to completely forget a girl he passionately loved just a few days before.</t2467>
<t2468>- But the phrase "intense love" is too nonsensical, too suspicious, too vague, so there's not much to say about it.</t2468> <t2469>It usually refers to emotions stemming from interactions lasting half an hour, as well as true love.</t2469> <t2470>Try asking yourself, how intense is Mr. Bingley's love?</t2470>
<t2471>- I have never seen such a promising affection.</t2471> <t2472>He hardly pays attention to anyone else, completely captivated by my sister.</t2472> <t2473>Each time they meet, their feelings seem more determined and vivid.</t2473> <t2474>At the ball he hosted, he offended two or three young ladies by not inviting them to dance, and I myself spoke to him twice without receiving a response.</t2474> <t2475>Could there be a clearer sign?</t2475>
<t2476>- Ah, that's right! I do think it's his feelings.</t2476> <t2477>Poor Jane! I feel for her because with her temperament, she can't get over it quickly.</t2477> <t2478>This should have happened to you, Lizzy; soon you would be able to joke about such a thing.</t2478> <t2479>But do you think your sister can overcome herself to return to us?</t2479> <t2480>A change of scenery, or being away from home for a while, might be beneficial for anything else.</t2480>
<t2481>Elizabeth was very pleased with such a proposal, confident that her sister would agree.</t2481> <t2482>Mrs. Gardiner added:</t2482>
<t2483>- I hope your sister won't be influenced by any thoughts about that young man.</t2483> <t2484>As you know, our family lives in a secluded part of the city, and we rarely go out, so it's unlikely that the two of them will meet.</t2484> <t2485>Unless he intentionally comes to find your sister.</t2485>
<t2486>- This is unlikely to happen because he is still being held by his friend, Mr. Darcy will not allow him to meet Jane in that area of London!</t2486> <t2487>My dear, how could you come up with such a thing? Mr. Darcy might have heard of a place like Gracechurch Street, but he should not think that a month of baptism is enough to cleanse all the stains from his person if he comes here, and consequently, Mr. Bingley never acts without him.</t2487>
<t2488>- Then all the better. She hopes the two of you will never meet again.</t2488> <t2489>But Jane will correspond with her sister, won't she?</t2489> <t2490>She won't be able to resist visiting.</t2490>
<t2491>- My sister will sever all relationships.</t2491>
<t2492>But although Elizabeth spoke firmly about this, as well as about Mr. Bingley being detained and unable to visit her sister, she still cared deeply about the matter, leading her to believe that not all hope was lost.</t2492> <t2493>She thought it very possible that his love would rekindle, and the natural influence of Jane's charm would overcome the influence of those around him.</t2493>
<t2494>Jane happily accepted her aunt's invitation. The Bingley household no longer occupied her thoughts with the idea that she might occasionally spend a morning with Caroline without having to see him, as she did not live in the same house as her brother.</t2494>
<t2495>The Gardiners stayed at Longbourn for a week.</t2495> <t2496>With the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without social engagements.</t2496> <t2497>Mrs. Bennet was so considerate in entertaining her brother and sister-in-law that they had no time to sit down for meals with the family.</t2497> <t2498>When there were social gatherings at the house, the officers were always present, among whom was certainly Mr. Wickham.</t2498> <t2499>On these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner noticed Elizabeth's warm demeanor towards him, so she carefully observed the two.</t2499> <t2500>She did not think they were deeply in love, but felt uneasy seeing them clearly affectionate towards each other.</t2500> <t2501>She decided to talk to Elizabeth about this before leaving Hertfordshire, explaining to her the need to be cautious in encouraging such an attachment.</t2501>
<t2502>For Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had a way of enjoying pleasures that had nothing to do with his abilities.</t2502> <t2503>About ten years ago, before she got married, she had lived for a long time in Derbyshire, Wickham's hometown.</t2503> <t2504>Therefore, she and Wickham had mutual friends.</t2504> <t2505>Although Wickham had seldom visited the area since Mr. Darcy's father passed away five years ago, it was through his abilities that she received new information about old acquaintances.</t2505>
<t2506>Mrs. Gardiner had come to Pemberley and knew very well about old Mr. Darcy's character.</t2506> <t2507>Therefore, this was a topic for endless conversation.</t2507> <t2508>When comparing what she remembered about Derbyshire with what Mr. Wickham described in detail, and when praising the character of the late master, both she and he found joy.</t2508> <t2509>Upon learning about how Darcy treated him, she tried to recall something about Darcy's youth that matched his story, and eventually, she remembered hearing Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy talk about a very proud and ill-tempered boy.</t2509>
<t2510>Chapter 26</t2510>
<t2511>Mrs. Gardiner took the opportunity to speak privately with Elizabeth to gently caution her.</t2511> <t2512>After honestly telling her what she thought, she added:</t2512>
<t2513>- Lizzy, you are mature enough not to fall in love just because you are warned against it.</t2513> <t2514>Therefore, I will not hesitate to speak frankly.</t2514> <t2515>I need to caution you, and I am serious about this.</t2515> <t2516>You should not get entangled with him in a relationship where material desires might make love reckless.</t2516> <t2517>I have nothing against him; he is someone worthy of our attention; and if he had the wealth he should have inherited, I could say there would be nothing better for you.</t2517> <t2518>You are sensible, and everyone expects you to use your sense.</t2518> <t2519>I believe your father will rely on your steadfastness and virtue.</t2519> <t2520>You should not disappoint your father.</t2520>
<t2521>- Auntie, what you said is really serious.</t2521>
<t2522>- That's right, and I hope you will be that serious.</t2522>
<t2523>- In that case, you shouldn't worry.</t2523> <t2524>I know how to take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too.</t2524> <t2525>He wouldn't love me if I could prevent it.</t2525>
<t2526>- Elizabeth, now you are being unserious.</t2526>
<t2527>- I'm sorry, aunt.</t2527> <t2528>Let me clarify further.</t2528> <t2529>Right now, I don't love Mr. Wickham, I truly don't.</t2529> <t2530>But in every respect, he is the most charming person I have ever met, and if he sincerely loves me, I believe it would be better if he didn't.</t2530> <t2531>I feel the need to be cautious.</t2531> <t2532>Oh dear! That dreadful Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me has given me a great honor, so I would be distressed to lose this honor.</t2532> <t2533>However, my father is not fair to Mr. Wickham.</t2533> <t2534>In short, dear aunt, I would be very sorry to make my loved ones unhappy, but as we see every day, when it comes to matters of love, young people rarely lack material desires, how can I promise to be much wiser than many friends if I am tempted, or how can I know that I must be wise to restrain myself? Therefore, I can only promise not to be hasty.</t2534> <t2535>I will not hastily believe in his initial intentions.</t2535> <t2536>When I meet him, I will not have any expectations.</t2536> <t2537>In short, I will do everything possible.</t2537>
<t2538>- It might also be a good idea if you advise him not to come here often.</t2538> <t2539>At the very least, you shouldn't remind your mother to invite him.</t2539>
<t2540>Elizabeth gave a conscious smile.</t2540>
<t2541>- As I reminded you that day.</t2541> <t2542>That's right, you should be wise and not do this.</t2542> <t2543>But you shouldn't think he always comes here.</t2543> <t2544>You noticed that this week he has often been invited.</t2544> <t2545>You know, my mother's idea is to always have her loved ones close by.</t2545> <t2546>But honestly, I swear on my honor that I will try to do what I believe is the wisest.</t2546> <t2547>And now, I think you are reassured.</t2547>
<t2548>Aunt reassured her niece that she was satisfied, and Elizabeth thanked her for her kind advice.</t2548> <t2549>The two parted ways, after a situation where advice was accepted without causing offense.</t2549><t2550>.</t2550>
<t2551>Mr. Collins returned to Hertfordshire shortly after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Jane left, but since he stayed at the Lucas house, his presence did not bother Mrs. Bennet much.</t2551> <t2552>His marriage was being hastily arranged, and in the end, she had to accept the inevitable, even though she often said in a displeased tone that she "hoped the two could be happy."</t2552> <t2553>The wedding was to be held on Thursday, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas came to say goodbye.</t2553> <t2554>As she stood up to leave, embarrassed by her mother's reluctant well-wishes, Elizabeth escorted her out of the room.</t2554> <t2555>As the two walked down the stairs, Charlotte said:</t2555>
<t2556>- Eliza, I hope you will keep in touch with me often.</t2556>
<t2557>- This is definitely doable.</t2557>
<t2558>- And she also asked for another job.</t2558> <t2559>Can you come visit her?</t2559>
<t2560>- I think we will often meet each other, in Hertfordshire.</t2560>
<t2561>- It is possible that for a while, I will not leave Kent.</t2561> <t2562>Therefore, please promise to visit me in Hunsford.</t2562>
<t2563>Elizabeth could not refuse, although she foresaw no pleasure in the visit.</t2563>
<t2564>Charlotte added:</t2564>
<t2565>- Your father and Maria will visit you in March, at that time I hope you will agree to go with them.</t2565> <t2566>Eliza, in fact, I wish to welcome you just as much as I look forward to seeing those two again.</t2566>
<t2567>The wedding ceremony was held.</t2567> <t2568>The bride and groom left the church to go to Kent, and everyone had something to say or listen to as usual.</t2568> <t2569>Soon, Elizabeth received news from her friend, the two still corresponded regularly as before.</t2569> <t2570>Every time she wrote to her, Elizabeth couldn't help but think that the comfortable friendliness was gone.</t2570> <t2571>Although she still wanted to keep in touch, it was because of their past rather than the present.</t2571> <t2572>She eagerly received Charlotte's first letters.</t2572> <t2573>Of course, there was the curious thought of wanting to know how she spoke about her new home, how she liked Lady Catherine, how she confidently claimed to be happy, even though Elizabeth felt Charlotte described everything exactly as Elizabeth had predicted.</t2573> <t2574>Charlotte's words in the letters were cheerful, seemingly wrapped in comfort, without touching on things she couldn't praise.</t2574> <t2575>The house, the interior, the neighbors, the roads, all were to her liking, and Lady Catherine was very friendly and accommodating.</t2575> <t2576>This was Mr. Collins' image of Hunsford and Rosings toned down to some extent, and Elizabeth felt she would have to wait until she visited them to know the other details.</t2576>
<t2577>Jane wrote a few lines to inform that she had arrived in London safely.</t2577> <t2578>Elizabeth hoped that her sister's next letter would tell something about the Bingley household.</t2578>
<t2579>Jane's impatience for the second letter was compensated, as she had been living in the city for a week without seeing or hearing from Caroline.</t2579> <t2580>However, she explained that the last letter to her friend might have been lost.</t2580> <t2581>She continued writing that her aunt would be going to the area they were residing in the next day, and she would have the opportunity to visit Grosvenor Street.</t2581>
<t2582>She wrote the letter after the visit.</t2582>
<t2583>“I didn't think Caroline was a sentimental person, but she was very happy to see me again and scolded me for not letting her know sooner that I had arrived in London.</t2583> <t2584>Therefore, I guessed correctly that my recent letter did not reach her.</t2584> <t2585>Of course, I inquired about her brother.</t2585> <t2586>He is still the same, but very busy with Mr. Darcy, so they rarely see him.</t2586> <t2587>I saw that they were waiting for Miss Darcy to have dinner.</t2587> <t2588>I hope to meet her.</t2588> <t2589>I couldn't stay long because Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were about to go out.</t2589> <t2590>I believe it won't be long before I see them here again.”</t2590>
<t2591>Elizabeth shook her head as she read the letter.</t2591> <t2592>It convinced her that only a chance opportunity could let Mr. Bingley know that her sister was currently in the city.</t2592>
<t2593>Four weeks passed, Jane did not see him at all.</t2593> <t2594>She told herself she had nothing to be upset about regarding this, but she couldn't help but notice Miss Bingley's indifference.</t2594> <t2595>After expecting every morning for two weeks, and every evening thinking of all sorts of reasons to excuse her friend, she finally came.</t2595> <t2596>But the brief visit and, moreover, her friend's changed attitude, made it impossible for Jane to deceive herself any longer.</t2596> <t2597>She wrote to Elizabeth about this:</t2597>
<t2598>“My dear Lizzy, you must be proud of having outshone me in judgment, as I admit I was completely deceived by Miss Bingley.</t2598> <t2599>But, my dear, although the event proves you right, do not think me stubborn if I say that my trust in him was as natural as your suspicion.</t2599> <t2600>I do not understand her reasons for being so friendly with me, but if similar situations arise, I am sure I will be deceived again.</t2600> <t2601>It was only yesterday that Caroline visited me in return, and she had not written a single word to me before that.</t2601> <t2602>When she came, it was clear she took no pleasure in the visit.</t2602> <t2603>She offered a superficial, solemn apology for not visiting sooner, without expressing any desire to see me again.</t2603> <t2604>Her demeanor had changed so completely that when she left, I resolved not to continue the acquaintance.</t2604> <t2605>I pity her, though I cannot help but blame her.</t2605> <t2606>She was entirely mistaken in targeting me.</t2606> <t2607>I can rightly say that all the beginnings of our acquaintance were initiated by her.</t2607> <t2608>But I pity her, for she must realize she was wrong, and I am convinced that the reason for this is her concern for her brother.</t2608> <t2609>I need not explain further; although we all know there is no need for such anxiety, if she is worried, it easily explains her attitude towards me.</t2609> <t2610>Any concern for her brother is natural and endearing, as he deserves such care from his sister.</t2610>
<t2611>However, she still worried about her fear, because if he still cared about her, he could have met her many days ago.</t2611> <t2612>From her sister's words, she was certain that he knew she was currently residing in the city.</t2612> <t2613>Yet, from the way she talked, it seemed he truly leaned towards Miss Darcy. She couldn't understand this.</t2613> <t2614>If she didn't fear being judged harshly, she could clearly say there was an ambivalent attitude in everything.</t2614> <t2615>But she would try to dispel all sorrowful thoughts, only thinking about things that made her happy, about her sister's love, about the kindness of their uncle and aunt.</t2615>
<t2616>Write to me soon. Miss Bingley mentioned something about him never returning to Netherfield, about giving up the house, but it is not certain.</t2616> <t2617>It is better not to mention this matter.</t2617> <t2618>I am very glad to know that you are on good terms with our friends at Hunsford.</t2618> <t2619>Go visit them, with Sir William and Maria. I believe you will feel comfortable there.</t2619>
<t2620>My older sister</t2620>
<t2621>Elizabeth felt somewhat pained when reading the letter, but she calmed herself with the thought that Jane would no longer be deceived, at least by the sister.</t2621> <t2622>All expectations from the brother had completely vanished.</t2622> <t2623>She did not even hope to rekindle his affections.</t2623> <t2624>His character had diminished in every respect.</t2624> <t2625>She sincerely hoped he would marry Miss Darcy, as a punishment for him and a benefit for Jane, because according to Mr. Wickham, she would make him deeply regret what he had thrown away.</t2625>
<t2626>Around this time, Mrs. Gardiner reminded Elizabeth of her promise to interact with that young man, and inquired about the news.</t2626> <t2627>Elizabeth had to comply to put her aunt at ease.</t2627> <t2628>He no longer paid exclusive attention to her; his attentions were gone, he was fond of someone else.</t2628> <t2629>Elizabeth observed carefully so she knew everything, but she could look and write about it without feeling sorrow.</t2629> <t2630>Her heart had only slightly fluttered; her vanity was satisfied with the thought that she could have been his only choice, if circumstances had allowed.</t2630> <t2631>The fact that he unexpectedly received ten thousand pounds was the most attractive thing about the girl he was pursuing.</t2631> <t2632>But Elizabeth, perhaps in this case not as farsighted as Charlotte, did not argue with him about his desire for independence.</t2632> <t2633>On the contrary, nothing could be more natural.</t2633> <t2634>While guessing that he had to go through some mental struggle to part from her, she was ready to wish him happiness.</t2634>
<t2635>She explained everything to Mrs. Gardiner, and continued:</t2635>
<t2636>“Dear aunt, now I am sure that I have never been in love, because if I had truly experienced that pure and noble feeling, I would now detest even his name and wish all sorts of ill upon him.</t2636> <t2637>But my feelings towards him are not only kind but also indifferent towards Miss King.</t2637> <t2638>I do not hate her at all, and I am willing to acknowledge that she is a good example of a fine young lady.</t2638> <t2639>There could not have been any love in this matter.</t2639> <t2640>My vigilance has paid off.</t2640> <t2641>Although I would certainly become the subject of everyone's attention if I foolishly fell in love with him, I do not regret becoming unimportant.</t2641> <t2642>Sometimes one can pay a high price to become important.</t2642> <t2643>Kitty and Lydia are more concerned than I am about his distancing himself from me.</t2643> <t2644>They are still young, not yet ready to accept the embarrassing reality that handsome young men must have something to rely on to live.”</t2644>
<t2645>Chapter 27</t2645>
<t2646>February and March passed without any events of greater importance at Longbourn, with little variation through visits to Meryton, sometimes muddy, sometimes cold.</t2646> <t2647>In March, Elizabeth visited Huntsford.</t2647> <t2648>At first, she had no serious intention of going there, but she learned that Charlotte was eagerly awaiting her, and she gradually thought of the trip with joy and more determination.</t2648> <t2649>Their absence had made her eager to see Charlotte again and less resentful of Mr. Collins.</t2649> <t2650>There was a bit of novelty in the plan, for with such a mother and sisters who could not be close, the family setting inevitably became unpleasant, so a little change of scenery was good for her.</t2650> <t2651>The trip could also give her a brief insight into Jane's situation.</t2651> <t2652>As the day of departure approached, she would have regretted any delay.</t2652> <t2653>However, everything went smoothly, finally arranged according to Charlotte's outline.</t2653> <t2654>She would accompany Sir William and his second daughter.</t2654> <t2655>They decided to spend the night in London, and thus the plan became perfect.</t2655>
<t2656>The only thing that worried her was having to leave her father, who would surely miss her, had asked her to write letters home and almost promised to reply, even though he didn't want to see her go.</t2656>
<t2657>Both she and Mr. Wickham showed the utmost friendliness when they parted; even he appeared more friendly.</t2657> <t2658>The affection he currently pursued could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to awaken feelings in him and deserved those feelings, the first to listen to him and pity him, the first to be admired by him.</t2658> <t2659>In the way he bid her farewell, when he wished her all happiness, reminded her of what Lady Catherine de Bourgh was like, and when he believed that their opinions of this lady – their opinions of everyone – always coincided, there was a desire, a concern that she felt must always bind her to him with the sincerest respect.</t2659> <t2660>Then she bid him farewell, believing that whether he was married or still single, he would always be to her the epitome of a charming person.</t2660>
<t2661>Her companions were not the kind of people who made her think he was less pleasant.</t2661> <t2662>Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, a cheerful girl but as empty-headed as her father, had nothing worth listening to.</t2662> <t2663>She listened to them with as much interest as she would to the clattering of a horse-drawn carriage.</t2663> <t2664>Elizabeth enjoyed hearing nonsense, but she had known Sir William for too long.</t2664> <t2665>He could no longer tell her anything new about his audience with the king or his knighthood, and his politeness was running thin with his repetitive stories.</t2665>
<t2666>The trip was only twenty-four miles, and the three of them set out early to reach Gracechurch Street by noon.</t2666> <t2667>As they entered Mrs. Gardiner's house, Jane was in the drawing-room watching them come in, and she stepped out to greet them.</t2667> <t2668>Elizabeth looked intently and was delighted to see that her sister was still as healthy and pretty as ever.</t2668> <t2669>On the stairs was a group of children, eager to meet their cousin but not allowed into the drawing-room, and too shy to approach because they hadn't seen her in twelve months.</t2669> <t2670>Everyone was cheerful and kind.</t2670> <t2671>They enjoyed each other's company all day; during the day they bustled around and went shopping, and in the evening they went to see a musical.</t2671>
<t2672>Then Elizabeth managed to sit with her aunt.</t2672> <t2673>The first topic of conversation between the aunt and niece was the elder sister.</t2673> <t2674>Elizabeth felt more sorrow than surprise after inquiring thoroughly and hearing that Jane had periods of despondency despite always struggling mentally to lift herself up.</t2674> <t2675>However, there was reason to hope that this condition would not last long.</t2675> <t2676>Mrs. Gardiner also mentioned Miss Bingley's visit, recounting the things the two ladies discussed, showing that Jane sincerely wanted to abandon the relationship.</t2676>
<t2677>Then Mrs. Gardiner inquired of her niece about Mr. Wickham's departure from her, praising her for enduring it very well.</t2677> <t2678>She added:</t2678>
<t2679>- But, Elizabeth dear, what kind of person is Miss King?</t2679> <t2680>You would regret it if you thought she was opportunistic.</t2680>
<t2681>- Aunt, could you please explain the difference between opportunism and prudence in matters of marriage?</t2681> <t2682>Where does prudence begin and where does greed end? Last Christmas, you were afraid I would marry him because it would be reckless, but now because he wants to marry a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to think he is greedy.</t2682>
<t2683>- If you just tell me what kind of person she is, I will know what to think.</t2683>
<t2684>- I believe she is a very good girl.</t2684> <t2685>I don't think badly of her.</t2685>
<t2686>- But he didn't pay any attention to her, not until she inherited that sum of money.</t2686>
<t2687>- That's right, but why did you have to pay attention to her first?</t2687> <t2688>If he is not allowed to win your affection because you have no money, what chance does he have to confess his feelings to a girl he doesn't care about and who is also poor?</t2688>
<t2689>- But it seems he lacked tact when he paid attention to her right after she inherited.</t2689>
<t2690>- A young man in distressing circumstances does not have time for all the formalities that others might adhere to.</t2690> <t2691>If she does not oppose, why should we oppose?</t2691>
<t2692>- Her lack of resistance cannot justify him.</t2692> <t2693>It only shows that she lacks either awareness or feelings.</t2693>
<t2694>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t2694>
<t2695>- Alright, it's up to you to think.</t2695> <t2696>He is greedy, and she is foolish.</t2696>
<t2697>- No, Lizzy, it's not up to you to think whatever you want.</t2697> <t2698>You know, I feel sad thinking badly about a young man who has lived in Derbyshire for a long time.</t2698>
<t2699>- Oh dear!</t2699> <t2700>If that's all, I have a very poor opinion of the young men living in Derbyshire, and their friends in Hertfordshire are no better.</t2700> <t2701>I'm fed up with all of them.</t2701> <t2702>Thank God! Tomorrow I will go to a place where I can find a man who has no agreeable qualities, no dignity, or sense worth mentioning.</t2702> <t2703>After all, only fools are worth getting to know.</t2703>
<t2704>- Be careful, Lizzy, such words clearly show disappointment.</t2704>
<t2705>Before they parted ways with a playful concluding remark, she had the unexpected pleasure of being invited to join her uncle and aunt on their summer trip.</t2705> <t2706>Mrs. Gardiner said:</t2706>
<t2707>- Aunt and uncle haven't decided how far they will go, but they might go to the Lake District.</t2707>
<t2708>No other plan could make Elizabeth as happy.</t2708> <t2709>She exclaimed enthusiastically:</t2709>
<t2710>- My dear aunt, that's wonderful! So exciting! You give me joy and new vitality! Farewell to all disappointment and melancholy.</t2710> <t2711>Compared to rocks and mountains, what are men? Oh my!</t2711> <t2712>I have so much time to explore!</t2712> <t2713>And when we return, we won't be like other tourists who can't give accurate opinions about anything.</t2713> <t2714>We will know where we have been, we will remember what we have seen.</t2714> <t2715>The rivers, lakes, and mountains will not be jumbled in our imagination; and when we try to describe a certain scene, we won't have to argue about its related circumstances.</t2715> <t2716>Let our initial overflowing emotions be more pleasant than the general feelings of other tourists...</t2716>
<t2717>Chapter 28</t2717>
<t2718>Everything on the next day's journey was new and exciting for Elizabeth. Her spirits were high because she had seen her sister in good health and had no worries, and the prospect of the trip to the North was a source of endless joy.</t2718>
<t2719>When they turned off the main road to go to Huntsford, every eye was searching for the Parsonage, which everyone thought could be seen after every turn, with the boundary of Rosings Park on one side.</t2719> <t2720>Elizabeth smiled as she recalled what she had heard about the inhabitants of this place.</t2720>
<t2721>Finally, the Parish Priest's Residence appeared.</t2721> <t2722>The garden sloped down to the road, the house lay within the fence and hedge, everything indicated they had reached their destination.</t2722> <t2723>Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the doorway, and the carriage stopped before a small gate leading to a short gravel path, amidst nods and smiles from the group.</t2723> <t2724>In a moment, the three of them got off the carriage, happy to see each other again.</t2724> <t2725>Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest joy, and Elizabeth grew increasingly pleased with the visit as the couple treated her with great affection.</t2725> <t2726>She immediately noticed that her cousin's manner had not changed after marriage.</t2726> <t2727>His formal politeness remained the same, and he kept her for a few minutes by the gate to inquire about her family.</t2727> <t2728>After showing the three guests the intricate details of the entrance, he invited them in, and as soon as they reached the hall, with deliberately ostentatious words, he once again welcomed them to his humble abode and reiterated his wife's invitation for refreshments.</t2728>
<t2729>Elizabeth had prepared herself to meet him again in his glory; she couldn't help but imagine that in the display of most of the room, its layout, and its furnishings, he particularly wanted to speak to her privately, as if wanting her to think about how much she had lost by refusing him.</t2729> <t2730>But although everything was neat and comfortable, she could not satisfy him with a single sigh expressing regret.</t2730> <t2731>Instead, she looked at her friend and wondered about such cheerfulness, with such a husband.</t2731> <t2732>When Mr. Collins said something that might embarrass his wife, she involuntarily turned to look at Charlotte.</t2732> <t2733>A couple of times she could detect a faint blush, but usually, Charlotte wisely ignored it as if she hadn't heard.</t2733> <t2734>After everyone had had time to admire the furnishings in the room, recount their journey and the events in London, Mr. Collins invited everyone to take a walk in the garden, which was quite large and meticulously arranged, tended by his own hands.</t2734> <t2735>Gardening was one of his respectable pleasures, and Elizabeth admired Charlotte's composed expression when her friend spoke about the health benefits of gardening; Elizabeth thought her friend intended to encourage this as much as possible.</t2735> <t2736>He led the three companions around, rarely giving them time to express any praise, pointing out every trivial detail, leaving the beauty completely behind.</t2736> <t2737>He could count the garden plots on every side and tell how many trees were in the farthest grove.</t2737> <t2738>But for all the beauty that his garden, or the entire region, or even the entire kingdom, could boast, nothing compared to the view of the Rosings estate, seen through a gap in the foliage surrounding the garden near the front of the Parsonage.</t2738> <t2739>This was a magnificent, modern mansion, situated on a small elevated piece of land.</t2739>
<t2740>From his garden, Mr. Collins wanted to take them to his two meadows, but the women were not wearing suitable shoes, so they turned back.</t2740> <t2741>While Sir William followed him, Charlotte led her sister and friend back, perhaps very happy to have the opportunity to introduce the residence without needing her husband's accompaniment.</t2741> <t2742>The residence was quite small, but it was built in a complete and convenient manner.</t2742> <t2743>Everything was arranged and equipped in an orderly and consistent way that Elizabeth attributed to Charlotte's efforts.</t2743> <t2744>When they could forget about Mr. Collins, there was clearly a comfortable atmosphere prevailing, and from Charlotte's cheerful demeanor, Elizabeth guessed that he was often forgotten.</t2744>
<t2745>She had heard that Lady Catherine was still staying in the area.</t2745> <t2746>They talked more about this at the dinner table, when Mr. Collins added his comments:</t2746>
<t2747>- Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honor of meeting Lady Catherine de Bourgh next Sunday at church, and I need not say that you will be very pleased with this opportunity.</t2747> <t2748>She is full of grace and sociable with those of lower status, and I am sure you will have the honor of being noticed by her a little when the service ends.</t2748> <t2749>I am certain that during your stay here, the Lady will invite you and my sister Maria to attend every gathering organized for us.</t2749> <t2750>Her attitude towards my dear Charlotte is truly captivating.</t2750> <t2751>We dine at her house twice a week, and we are never allowed to walk back.</t2751> <t2752>The Lady's carriage is often called for us to use.</t2752> <t2753>I must say, one of the carriages, because the Lady has several.</t2753>
<t2754>Charlotte added:</t2754>
<t2755>- Madam is truly a very respectable person, who knows right from wrong, and is the most considerate neighbor.</t2755>
<t2756>- That's right, my dear, this is exactly what I said.</t2756> <t2757>She is the kind of woman whom people respect no matter what.</t2757>
<t2758>In the evening, they sat together mainly talking about the news in Hertfordshire and recounting what they had exchanged through letters.</t2758> <t2759>When they finished, Elizabeth sat alone in the room designated for her, contemplating Charlotte's contented appearance, to understand more about the cleverness in guiding and enduring her husband, and to acknowledge that her friend had behaved well in all matters.</t2759> <t2760>Previously, she had anticipated what this trip would be like, with the daily routines, the annoying interjections of Mr. Collins, and their enthusiasm in their relationship with Rosings.</t2760> <t2761>A rich imagination soon delineated everything.</t2761>
<t2762>In the middle of the next day, as she was preparing to go out for a walk, a sudden noise seemed to throw the entire house into chaos.</t2762> <t2763>After listening for a moment, she heard the hurried footsteps of someone running up the stairs and loudly calling her name.</t2763> <t2764>She opened the door and met Maria on the stairs, who breathlessly exclaimed:</t2764>
<t2765>- Hey, Eliza! Please hurry to the dining room, because there's something you need to see! I won't tell you what it is.</t2765> <t2766>Quickly, please come down right away.</t2766>
<t2767>Elizabeth asked but there was no answer; Maria refused to say anything more.</t2767> <t2768>They ran down to the dining room to look out onto the street.</t2768> <t2769>Two women arrived in a four-wheeled carriage, stopping in front of the garden gate, Elizabeth exclaimed:</t2769>
<t2770>- Is that all? I thought at least a few pigs had run into the garden, but here there are only Lady Catherine and her daughter!</t2770>
<t2771>Maria was quite surprised by the mistake:</t2771>
<t2772>- No, ma'am.</t2772> <t2773>That is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them.</t2773> <t2774>The other one is Miss De Bourgh. Look at her.</t2774> <t2775>She is quite small.</t2775> <t2776>Who could think she is so thin and small.</t2776>
<t2777>- She was indeed rude to make Charlotte go outside in this wind.</t2777> <t2778>Why doesn't she come inside?</t2778>
<t2779>- Ah! Charlotte says she rarely agrees to come inside.</t2779> <t2780>If Miss De Bourgh agrees, it is the greatest favor.</t2780>
<t2781>Elizabeth said:</t2781>
<t2782>- She likes her figure.</t2782>
<t2783>Suddenly, Elizabeth had a new thought.</t2783> <t2784>"She looks weak and irritable.</t2784> <t2785>Yes, she will suit him.</t2785> <t2786>She will be a very fitting wife for him."</t2786>
<t2787>Mr. Collins and Charlotte are standing by the gate talking to two women.</t2787> <t2788>Sir William is standing by the door frame, which distracts Elizabeth. He is solemnly observing the scene before him and always bows whenever Miss De Bourgh looks his way.</t2788>
<t2789>In the end, they had nothing left to say.</t2789> <t2790>The two women drove away, and the others went into the house.</t2790> <t2791>As soon as he saw the two ladies, Mr. Collins hurriedly congratulated them both, and Charlotte explained that everyone was invited to dinner at Rosings the next day.</t2791>
<t2792>Chapter 29</t2792>
<t2793>The triumph of Mr. Collins after they received such an invitation was complete.</t2793> <t2794>The opportunity to present to the guests, who were astonished, the influence of his patroness and her courteous attitude towards him and his wife, was exactly what he had hoped for.</t2794> <t2795>Such an opportunity came quite quickly, demonstrating the Lady's affability towards her subordinates, which he did not know how to admire adequately.</t2795> <t2796>He said:</t2796>
<t2797>- I must confess that I should not have been surprised by Lady Catherine inviting us this Sunday for tea and dinner at Rosings.</t2797> <t2798>Given what I know about Lady Catherine's kindness, this was bound to happen.</t2798> <t2799>But who could have anticipated such kindness? Who could have imagined that we would receive a dinner invitation as soon as you arrived!</t2799>
<t2800>Sir William replied:</t2800>
<t2801>- I am less surprised by what happened, as the circumstances of my life have helped me understand the true nature of the upper class.</t2801> <t2802>Speaking of the court, such cases of refined upbringing are not uncommon.</t2802>
<t2803>All that day and the next morning, they hardly talked about anything other than the upcoming visit to Rosings.</t2803> <t2804>Mr. Collins carefully instructed the three guests on what they would encounter, so that the grandeur of the rooms, the numerous servants, and the splendid dinner would not overwhelm them.</t2804> <t2805>He spoke privately to Elizabeth:</t2805>
<t2806>- My dear sister.</t2806> <t2807>You should not be anxious about your appearance.</t2807> <t2808>The lady does not require us to dress elegantly, so both she and her daughter dress plainly.</t2808> <t2809>I suggest that you simply wear the outfit that looks better than the others, nothing more.</t2809> <t2810>Lady Catherine will not think ill of you if you dress simply.</t2810> <t2811>She wants everyone to maintain the distinctiveness of their own class.</t2811>
<t2812>While they were getting ready, he went to each room two or three times to urge them to hurry, as the Lady greatly disliked having to wait for her dinner.</t2812> <t2813>Maria Lucas was horrified by such dreadful details about the Lady and her way of life.</t2813> <t2814>Unaccustomed to socializing, she prepared for the party at Rosings with as much anxiety as her father had when he was knighted at St. James's Palace.</t2814>
<t2815>Because of the good weather, they leisurely walked about half a mile, through a grove of trees.</t2815> <t2816>Each garden had its own unique beauty and distinctive panorama. Elizabeth enjoyed the scenery, though she did not show the excitement that Mr. Collins hoped the view would evoke in her.</t2816> <t2817>She absentmindedly listened to him talk about the number of windows on the mansion's facade and the cost of polishing that Sir Lewis De Bourgh had to incur.</t2817>
<t2818>As they ascended the steps leading to the vestibule, Maria became increasingly alarmed, and even Sir William could not remain completely calm.</t2818> <t2819>Elizabeth's courageous temperament did not abandon her.</t2819> <t2820>She had not heard anything about Lady Catherine that suggested extraordinary talents or miraculous virtues.</t2820> <t2821>As for the grandeur stemming from wealth and status, she thought she could witness it without fear.</t2821>
<t2822>From the foyer, where Mr. Collins enthusiastically pointed out the harmonious proportions and decorative patterns, they followed the servant through the antechamber and then entered a room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were seated.</t2822> <t2823>The lady, with a formally humble demeanor, stood up to greet them.</t2823> <t2824>Since Mrs. Collins had agreed with her husband that the introductions should be entirely her responsibility, she carried them out in the proper manner, without the apologies and thanks that her husband might have thought necessary.</t2824>
<t2825>Although present at St. James's Palace, Sir William still felt completely awed by the magnificent surroundings, to the point where he only had the courage to bow very low and then sit down without being able to say a word.</t2825> <t2826>His daughter, terrified to the extent of almost losing all her senses, sat on the edge of her seat, not knowing which way to turn.</t2826> <t2827>Elizabeth felt herself quite at ease with the setting, able to calmly observe the three women in front of her.</t2827> <t2828>Lady Catherine was tall and large, with strong features that might have once been beautiful.</t2828> <t2829>Her manner and gestures of greeting did not aim to win affection, such as helping the guests forget their lower status.</t2829> <t2830>When silent, she did not seem terrifying, but every word she spoke carried an authoritative tone as if to assert her position.</t2830> <t2831>She immediately reminded Elizabeth of Mr. Wickham, and from what she had observed, Elizabeth believed she was exactly the type of person he had described.</t2831>
<t2832>After examining the mother, whose face and gestures vaguely resembled Mr. Darcy, she turned to look at the daughter.</t2832> <t2833>She found Maria's surprise understandable, as the girl was too slender and too short.</t2833> <t2834>The mother and daughter bore no resemblance to each other in terms of stature or face.</t2834> <t2835>Miss De Bourgh had a pale, sickly complexion; her features were unremarkable, though not unattractive.</t2835> <t2836>She spoke very little except when addressing Mrs. Jenkinson, in a soft voice.</t2836> <t2837>The latter had nothing distinctive in appearance, paying attention only to what Miss De Bourgh said.</t2837>
<t2838>After sitting for a few minutes, they were led to a window to enjoy the view.</t2838> <t2839>Mr. Collins followed to point out the beauties, and Lady Catherine politely mentioned that the scenery was more beautiful in the summer.</t2839>
<t2840>The dinner was exceedingly sumptuous.</t2840> <t2841>All the servants and every piece of glassware and dishware that Mr. Collins had mentioned were present.</t2841> <t2842>As he had been forewarned, he sat down at the end of the table; according to the Lady's wishes, and acting as if nothing in life could be greater for him, he carved the food, eating and praising with all his quick words.</t2842> <t2843>Every dish was praised, first through his words, then through Sir William's, who had recovered enough to echo every word his son-in-law said, in a manner that made Elizabeth wonder if Lady Catherine could endure it.</t2843> <t2844>But Lady Catherine seemed pleased with the excessive praise, smiling very graciously, especially when there was a dish that was new to them.</t2844> <t2845>They did not converse much with each other.</t2845> <t2846>Elizabeth was ready to respond whenever spoken to, but she sat between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh – the former only focused on listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter did not say a word throughout the meal.</t2846> <t2847>Mrs. Jenkinson primarily concerned herself with overseeing Miss De Bourgh's eating, urging her to try various dishes; worried she wasn't eating well.</t2847> <t2848>Maria could not say anything; the men only ate and praised.</t2848>
<t2849>When the women returned to the living room, they did nothing more than listen to Lady Catherine speak.</t2849> <t2850>She spoke incessantly until the servants brought out the coffee.</t2850> <t2851>She gave her opinion on every subject with a decisive manner as if to demonstrate that she was not accustomed to being contradicted.</t2851> <t2852>She inquired knowledgeably and meticulously about the concerns in Charlotte's family life, giving her much advice on managing everything; she told her how to coordinate everything in a small household; she instructed her on how to take care of her cattle and poultry.</t2852> <t2853>Elizabeth noticed that nothing escaped her attention, giving her the opportunity to impose her opinions on others.</t2853> <t2854>Between conversations with Mrs. Collins, Lady Catherine asked many questions of Maria and Elizabeth, especially Elizabeth.</t2854> <t2855>She knew the least about Elizabeth and remarked to Mrs. Collins that Elizabeth was a gentle and pretty young woman.</t2855> <t2856>She asked her many questions, how many sisters she had, if any were about to get married, whether they were beautiful, how educated they were, what kind of carriage her father had, and what her mother's maiden name was. Elizabeth found all her questions irrelevant but calmly answered them.</t2856> <t2857>Then Lady Catherine remarked:</t2857>
<t2858>- Her father's estate is to be inherited by Mr. Collins in order, as I heard.</t2858>
<t2859>Then she turned to Charlotte:</t2859>
<t2860>- I am happy for you, but on the other hand, I do not see the opportunity to pass on the inheritance through the female line.</t2860> <t2861>In the family of Mr. Lewis De Bourgh, this is considered unnecessary.</t2861> <t2862>Do you pursue music and vocal arts, Miss Bennet?</t2862>
<t2863>- Just a little.</t2863>
<t2864>- Ah! Then at some point, we would be delighted to hear you perform.</t2864> <t2865>Our musical instruments are of good quality, even better.</t2865> <t2866>You should try them someday.</t2866> <t2867>Do your sisters study these arts as well?</t2867>
<t2868>- There is a person.</t2868>
<t2869>- Why don't all of you study?</t2869> <t2870>All of you need to study.</t2870> <t2871>The Webb sisters all study, while their father doesn't have as much income as your father.</t2871> <t2872>Do you study painting?</t2872>
<t2873>- No, no one is studying.</t2873>
<t2874>- What, no one?</t2874><t2875></t2875>
<t2876>- No one.</t2876>
<t2877>- That's really strange.</t2877> <t2878>But I guess you girls didn't have the chance.</t2878> <t2879>Your mother should have taken you to the city every spring to study with renowned artists.</t2879>
<t2880>- Our mother surely wouldn't object, but our father hates London.</t2880>
<t2881>- Has your tutor quit already</t2881><t2882>?</t2882>
<t2883>- We have never had a tutor.</t2883>
<t2884>- No governess!</t2884> <t2885>How can that be?</t2885> <t2886>Five daughters brought up in the house without a governess!</t2886> <t2887>I have never heard of such a thing.</t2887> <t2888>Your mother must have been a slave to your education.</t2888>
<t2889>Elizabeth couldn't help but smile as she explained that it wasn't like that.</t2889>
<t2890>- Then, who teaches you? Who takes care of you? Without a tutor, you must have been neglected.</t2890>
<t2891>- Compared to other families, I believe we were neglected, but if we wanted to learn, we were not lacking in resources.</t2891> <t2892>We were always encouraged to read books, and had tutors for all subjects when necessary.</t2892> <t2893>Those who wanted leisure could have leisure.</t2893>
<t2894>- Ah, that's right, but a tutor can prevent this.</t2894><t2895>If I had known your mother, I could have urgently advised her to have a tutor.</t2895><t2896>I always say that nothing can be achieved in education without long-term and regular teaching, and only a tutor can accomplish this.</t2896><t2897>It's quite wonderful to think about how many families I've had the opportunity to assist in this way.</t2897><t2898>I'm always delighted to support a young person to achieve a good position.</t2898><t2899>Four of Mrs. Jenkinson's nephews have been arranged in the best manner through my means.</t2899><t2900>Just recently, I recommended a young person who was only mentioned to me by someone else, and the family is very happy with her.</t2900><t2901>Mrs. Collins, did I tell you about Lady Metcalfe visiting me yesterday to thank me?</t2901><t2902>She considers Miss Pope a treasure.</t2902><t2903>She said: “Lady Catherine, you have given me a treasure.” Miss Bennet, have any of your sisters ever been out in society?</t2903>
<t2904>- Yes, Madam, all of it.</t2904>
<t2905>- All of them! What, all five girls at once? How strange!</t2905> <t2906>And you are only the second child in the family.</t2906> <t2907>The younger sisters are socializing before the eldest gets married!</t2907> <t2908>Your younger sisters must be very young?</t2908><t2909>!</t2909>
<t2910>- Yes, the youngest one is not yet sixteen.</t2910> <t2911>Perhaps she is still too young to socialize widely.</t2911> <t2912>But, madam, I truly think it is too harsh for the younger sisters if they are not allowed to socialize and enjoy themselves just because the eldest sister is not yet in a position or does not intend to marry soon.</t2912> <t2913>I believe the youngest child also has the right to enjoy the pleasures of youth like the eldest.</t2913> <t2914>And being so restrained, I think it is difficult to foster sisterly bonds or develop the subtlety of the soul.</t2914>
<t2915>- You have quite a decisive opinion for someone young.</t2915> <t2916>May I ask, how old are you?</t2916>
<t2917>Elizabeth smiled:</t2917>
<t2918>- With three younger sisters who have grown up, Madam can hardly expect me to reveal my age publicly.</t2918>
<t2919>Lady Catherine seemed quite surprised not to receive a direct answer, and Elizabeth guessed she was the first creature to dare to disregard such an intrusion into personal matters!</t2919>
<t2920>- I'm sure you're not yet twenty, so you don't need to hide your age.</t2920>
<t2921>- I am not yet twenty-one.</t2921>
<t2922>When they joined the group and had finished their tea, they set up the card tables.</t2922> <t2923>Lady Charlotte, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to play a four-person card game.</t2923> <t2924>Since Miss De Bourgh wanted to play a different game, the two young ladies had the honor of forming a table with Mrs. Jenkinson.</t2924> <t2925>This group was extremely dull.</t2925> <t2926>Hardly a word was spoken that did not pertain to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed concern that Miss De Bourgh might be too hot or too cold, or that there was too much or too little light.</t2926> <t2927>The other table had more going on.</t2927> <t2928>Lady Catherine talked more – pointing out the faults of the other three, or recounting some anecdotes about herself.</t2928> <t2929>Mr. Collins agreed with everything Lady Catherine said, thanked her whenever he scored points, and apologized when he thought he was winning too much.</t2929> <t2930>Sir William did not say much.</t2930> <t2931>His mind was busy remembering the anecdotes and the names of the aristocratic figures.</t2931>
<t2932>When Lady Catherine and her daughter decided it was enough, they put away the card tables, Mrs. Collins was offered the carriage and she gladly accepted.</t2932> <t2933>Then the whole group sat around the fireplace to hear Lady Catherine decide what the weather would be like the next day.</t2933> <t2934>Then they were informed that the carriage had arrived, with many expressions of gratitude from Mr. Collins along with many bows from Sir William, they bid each other farewell.</t2934> <t2935>As soon as they left, Mr. Collins asked Elizabeth about her impressions of Rosings.</t2935> <t2936>To please Charlotte, she made more favorable comments than she truly felt.</t2936> <t2937>But her words of praise, though they made her somewhat uncomfortable, still could not satisfy Mr. Collins, so he had to add more of his own to further extol Lady Catherine.</t2937>
<t2938>Chapter 30</t2938>
<t2939>Sir William stayed in Huntsford for only a week, but it was enough for him to believe that his daughter was settled in the most satisfactory manner, that she had a husband and neighbors that were not easy to find.</t2939> <t2940>While Sir William was staying there, Mr. Collins spent every morning driving him out into the countryside.</t2940> <t2941>When he left, the whole family returned to their usual routine.</t2941> <t2942>Elizabeth was pleased to see that they seldom saw him, for in the time between breakfast and dinner, he was either working in the garden or reading and writing, sitting in his own study at the front of the house looking out the window, while the women's gathering room was at the back of the house.</t2942> <t2943>At first, Catherine was puzzled that Charlotte did not want to use the dining room for everyone to gather in, as it was quite spacious and had a better view, but soon she saw that her friend had a very good reason, for if they used the large room, Mr. Collins would seldom be in his own study.</t2943>
<t2944>From the living room, they couldn't distinguish anything on the road, and they remembered Mr. Collins telling them what kind of carriage was passing by, especially how often Miss De Bourgh would come by in her four-wheeled carriage, which he always informed them of in advance even though she came almost every day.</t2944> <t2945>She often stopped in front of the Parsonage and chatted for a few minutes with Charlotte but almost never stepped out of the carriage.</t2945>
<t2946>There were very few days when Mr. Collins did not go to Rosings, and there were also many days when his wife thought it unnecessary to do so.</t2946> <t2947>Elizabeth could not understand the need to sacrifice so much time until she remembered that there might be other family activities that needed to be excluded.</t2947> <t2948>Occasionally, they had the honor of being visited by the Lady, and nothing that happened during these visits escaped her observation.</t2948> <t2949>She would scrutinize the couple's lifestyle, look into their work and advise them to do it differently, criticize the arrangement of the furniture, or notice the servants' negligence.</t2949> <t2950>If she accepted to have refreshments, it seemed she did so only to find out that Mrs. Collins's portions of meat were too large for the family.</t2950>
<t2951>Elizabeth soon learned that, although this Lady did not hold any civil office for the local county, she was the most active magistrate in her parish, and every minor issue was reported to her by Mr. Collins.</t2951> <t2952>When the local residents quarreled with each other, expressed dissatisfaction, or fell into distress, she would come to resolve the disagreements, quell the complaints, and reprimand them to bring them into a state of harmony and prosperity.</t2952>
<t2953>They were invited to dine at Rosings about twice a week.</t2953> <t2954>After Mr. William had left and there was only one card table, each dining opportunity was no longer as enjoyable as the first evening.</t2954> <t2955>They had little chance to interact with anyone else, as the lifestyle of the neighbors did not suit the Collins family.</t2955> <t2956>This did not bother Elizabeth.</t2956> <t2957>During this time, she felt quite comfortable.</t2957> <t2958>She had half-hour conversations with Charlotte each time.</t2958> <t2959>The weather was very pleasant for this time of year, so she often enjoyed being outdoors.</t2959> <t2960>The path she liked to walk the most, especially when others were invited to Rosings, was the shaded trail along the garden fence that seemed to be favored only by her, where she felt she could escape Lady Catherine's prying eyes.</t2960>
<t2961>The first two weeks of Elizabeth's visit passed in this manner.</t2961> <t2962>Easter was approaching, and a week before that, a notable person was expected to visit the Rosings family, which, in such a small household, would be a significant event.</t2962> <t2963>Elizabeth had heard that Mr. Darcy would be coming.</t2963> <t2964>Although there were few people she did not like, his presence would add a new subject for observation within the Rosings family.</t2964> <t2965>She might be interested in seeing how Miss Bingley's schemes regarding him would become futile, by examining his attitude towards his cousin, as it was clear that Lady Catherine had decided his fate with her.</t2965> <t2966>She had announced his imminent arrival with great satisfaction, speaking of him in terms of admiration, and seemed almost angry upon learning that Miss Lucas and Elizabeth herself had often met him.</t2966>
<t2967>Not long after, the entire Parish House knew about his impending visit, because Mr. Collins had spent the entire morning walking around Huntsford spreading the news. After bowing at Rosings Park, he hurried home with the most important news.</t2967> <t2968>The next morning, he rushed to Rosings to pay his respects.</t2968> <t2969>He needed to greet Lady Catherine's two nephews, as Mr. Darcy had brought along a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle.</t2969> <t2970>When Mr. Collins returned, the two men followed him.</t2970> <t2971>From her husband's room, Charlotte saw them crossing the road.</t2971> <t2972>She quickly ran in to inform the women and added:</t2972>
<t2973>- She thanks Eliza for this courteous action.</t2973> <t2974>Mr. Darcy would never have visited her so quickly.</t2974>
<t2975>Elizabeth had barely had time to decline the praise before the doorbell announced their arrival, and a moment later, three people entered the room.</t2975> <t2976>Colonel Fitzwilliam led the way.</t2976> <t2977>He was about thirty, not handsome, but his demeanor and speech indicated he was a gentleman.</t2977> <t2978>Mr. Darcy looked the same as when he was in Hertfordshire.</t2978> <t2979>He greeted Mrs. Collins with his usual reserve.</t2979> <t2980>No matter what feelings he had for her friend, he remained composed.</t2980> <t2981>Elizabeth merely inclined her head to him, without saying a word.</t2981>
<t2982>Colonel Fitzwilliam started the conversation directly with the fluency and ease of a well-educated person, speaking very pleasantly.</t2982> <t2983>But his cousin, after making a few remarks to Mrs. Collins about the house and garden, did not say another word to anyone.</t2983> <t2984>However, after a while, his politeness awakened, prompting him to inquire Elizabeth about the health of her family members.</t2984> <t2985>She answered him in the usual manner, and after a moment, added:</t2985>
<t2986>- My eldest sister has been living in the city for three months now.</t2986> <t2987>Have you met her?</t2987>
<t2988>She had the impression that he had indeed met her, but she wanted to see if he would reveal any knowledge about what had happened between the Bingleys and Jane.</t2988> <t2989>She thought he seemed a bit confused when he replied that he had not had the good fortune to meet Miss Bennet again.</t2989> <t2990>No one said anything more about the matter, and shortly after, the gentlemen took their leave.</t2990>
<t2991>Chapter 31</t2991>
<t2992>Everyone in the Parsonage admired Colonel Fitzwilliam's demeanor, and the women in particular thought he would make the gatherings at Rosings more enjoyable.</t2992> <t2993>However, they were only invited over for Easter because there were many other guests, and they were asked to come only in the evening after attending church services.</t2993> <t2994>During this week, they rarely saw Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam visited the Parsonage a couple of times, but they only saw Mr. Darcy at church.</t2994>
<t2995>Mrs. Catherine received them in the living room.</t2995> <t2996>Her attitude remained polite, but it was clear that she only accepted their presence when she couldn't invite anyone else.</t2996> <t2997>In fact, she almost exclusively focused on her two nephews; she conversed with them, especially with Mr. Darcy, more than with anyone else.</t2997>
<t2998>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed pleased to meet the family of his host; whatever the case, he was warmly welcomed at Rosings.</t2998> <t2999>The beautiful friend of Mrs. Collins particularly caught his attention.</t2999> <t3000>Now he was sitting next to her, engaging in pleasant conversation about Kent and Hertfordshire, about traveling and staying at home, about new books and music, to the extent that Elizabeth had never felt so entertained.</t3000> <t3001>The two of them chatted so animatedly and cheerfully together that even Lady Catherine took notice, as did Mr. Darcy.</t3001> <t3002>His eyes frequently turned towards the two with curiosity.</t3002> <t3003>The lady shared the same sentiment and did not hesitate to exclaim:</t3003>
<t3004>- What are you talking about, Fitzwilliam? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear it too.</t3004>
<t3005>He said, when he could no longer avoid it:</t3005>
<t3006>- We are talking about music, aunt.</t3006>
<t3007>- About music?</t3007> <t3008>Then you should speak up.</t3008> <t3009>Among the arts, my favorite is music.</t3009> <t3010>I must join the conversation if you are talking about music.</t3010> <t3011>I don't think there are many people in England who appreciate music more than I do, or have a higher taste for it than I do.</t3011> <t3012>If I had the opportunity to study, I could master it.</t3012> <t3013>And so could Ann, if her health permitted.</t3013> <t3014>I believe she could perform wonderfully.</t3014> <t3015>What about Georgiana, Darcy?</t3015>
<t3016>Mr. Darcy lovingly praised his sister's proficiency.</t3016>
<t3017>Lady Catherine said:</t3017>
<t3018>- Auntie is very happy to hear you talk about her, and please convey Auntie's message to her that she cannot become outstanding if she does not practice a lot.</t3018>
<t3019>He replied:</t3019>
<t3020>- Xin Di believes that she did not wait until she received such advice.</t3020> <t3021>She practiced continuously.</t3021>
<t3022>- That's good.</t3022> <t3023>No amount of practice is ever enough. When I write to her, I will insist that she must not be distracted for any reason.</t3023> <t3024>I often tell young girls that to excel in music, they must practice regularly.</t3024> <t3025>I have often told Miss Bennet several times that she can never play well unless she practices more.</t3025> <t3026>Even though Mrs. Collins does not have a piano, I often tell her that we are ready to let her practice at Rosings and use the piano in Mrs. Jenkinson's room.</t3026> <t3027>You know, in that room, she won't disturb anyone.</t3027>
<t3028>Mr. Darcy seemed a bit embarrassed by his aunt's demeanor but did not reply.</t3028>
<t3029>When they had finished their coffee, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of her promise to play the piano for him, and she sat down in front of the instrument.</t3029> <t3030>He pulled a chair over to sit beside her.</t3030> <t3031>Lady Catherine listened to half the piece, then resumed her conversation with Mr. Darcy as before; until he disengaged himself from her, walking with his usual leisurely gait towards the piano.</t3031> <t3032>He positioned himself where he could observe Elizabeth's entire face.</t3032> <t3033>She noticed, and during the pause between two pieces, said:</t3033>
<t3034>- Mr. Darcy, are you trying to overwhelm me by standing here listening to me play?</t3034> <t3035>I will not worry about the fact that your sister indeed plays music well.</t3035> <t3036>I have a stubborn nature that never fears the will of others.</t3036> <t3037>I always gain more courage with each threat.</t3037>
<t3038>He replied:</t3038>
<t3039>- I don't want to say you're mistaken, because I can't believe that I have any intention of intimidating you.</t3039> <t3040>I have had the pleasure of knowing you for a long time, so I understand that you occasionally find it amusing to express thoughts that are not really yours.</t3040>
<t3041>Elizabeth laughed joyfully at the description of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam:</t3041>
<t3042>- Your cousin will show you a very beautiful side of me, and teach you clearly not to believe my words.</t3042> <t3043>I am unfortunate to encounter someone who can clearly reveal my true self, in a part of the world where I hoped to be judged favorably.</t3043> <t3044>Mr. Darcy, you lack generosity when you say you know all about me in Hertfordshire, allow me to say, you were also too rude, for you provoked me to retaliate, and if this happens, your relatives will be shocked to hear what I say.</t3044>
<t3045>He smiled:</t3045>
<t3046>- I'm not afraid of you.</t3046>
<t3047>Colonel Fitzwilliam exclaimed:</t3047>
<t3048>- Please let me hear what you accuse him of.</t3048> <t3049>I need to know how he treats others.</t3049>
<t3050>- Then you will listen, but be prepared to hear something dreadful.</t3050> <t3051>The first time I met him was in Hertfordshire, you know, at a ball, and at this ball, do you know what he did? He only danced four dances! Sorry to break your heart, but that's the truth.</t3051> <t3052>He only danced four dances, even though young men were scarce, and I know for a fact that there was a young girl who had to sit out because there were not enough dance partners.</t3052> <t3053>Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.</t3053>
<t3054>- At that time, I did not have the honor of knowing any lady outside of my group.</t3054>
<t3055>- That's right, and no one has ever been introduced at a ball.</t3055> <t3056>So, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what should I play next?</t3056> <t3057>My fingers are awaiting your command.</t3057>
<t3058>Darcy said:</t3058>
<t3059>- Perhaps I should consider more carefully if I seek an introduction, but I am not qualified to introduce myself to strangers.</t3059>
<t3060>Elizabeth still spoke directly to Colonel Fitzwilliam:</t3060>
<t3061>- Should we ask your cousin about the reason for this?</t3061> <t3062>Should we ask how a conscious and educated person, who has lived in this social class, could be unfit to introduce to strangers?</t3062>
<t3063>Fitzwilliam said:</t3063>
<t3064>- I can answer your question without needing him.</t3064> <t3065>It's just because he isn't diligent.</t3065>
<t3066>Darcy said:</t3066>
<t3067>- I certainly don't have the talent that some people possess, to easily converse with someone they've never met before.</t3067> <t3068>I can't join in their conversations or show interest in their issues, as I often see them do.</t3068>
<t3069>Elizabeth said:</t3069>
<t3070>- My fingers are not as skillful on this instrument as many other girls', because they lack the same strength or dexterity, and do not express the same emotions.</t3070> <t3071>But then I always considered it my fault – because I did not practice diligently.</t3071> <t3072>It's not that I don't believe my fingers have the same potential as any woman who plays better than me.</t3072>
<t3073>Darcy smiled:</t3073>
<t3074>- You are absolutely right.</t3074> <t3075>You have used your time much more beneficially.</t3075> <t3076>No one who has the privilege of hearing you play can think there is any weakness.</t3076> <t3077>Neither of us performs for strangers.</t3077>
<t3078>They were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to ask what they were talking about.</t3078> <t3079>Elizabeth immediately began to play music.</t3079> <t3080>Lady Catherine approached, and after listening for a while, said to Mr. Darcy:</t3080>
<t3081>- Miss Bennet's performance was flawless, if she practices more and gets a teacher in London.</t3081> <t3082>Her playing is quite skillful, although her taste is not as refined as Ann's. Ann could perform wonderfully if her health allowed her to practice.</t3082>
<t3083>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how he would respond to his aunt's praise of his cousin, but at that moment and at any other time, she did not detect any sign of affection.</t3083> <t3084>From the way he treated Miss De Bourgh, she felt reassured about her sister that Mr. Bingley could have married her if she had been related to him.</t3084>
<t3085>Lady Catherine continued to comment on Elizabeth's level of performance, mixing in advice on how to perform and appreciate music.</t3085> <t3086>Elizabeth accepted it with all the patience that politeness demanded, and at the request of the gentlemen, she remained at the piano until the carriage was ready to take them home.</t3086>
<t3087>Chapter 32</t3087>
<t3088>The next morning, while sitting alone writing a letter to Jane as Mrs. Collins and Maria had business in the village, Elizabeth was surprised to hear the doorbell signaling a visitor.</t3088> <t3089>Since she did not hear a carriage, she thought it could not be Lady Catherine.</t3089> <t3090>She set the unfinished letter aside.</t3090> <t3091>When the door opened, she was surprised to see Mr. Darcy, and only Mr. Darcy, walk in.</t3091>
<t3092>He also showed surprise to see her alone, and apologized for being abrupt, saying he had assumed all women would be at home.</t3092>
<t3093>Then the two sat down, and when she asked him about Rosings, it seemed there was a risk they would lapse into silence.</t3093> <t3094>Therefore, needing to think of something else, in this urgent moment she recalled the last time she met him in Hertfordshire, and wondered what he thought about their hasty departure.</t3094> <t3095>She remarked:</t3095>
<t3096>- All of you left Netherfield quite suddenly, Mr. Darcy! Mr. Bingley must have been pleasantly surprised to see you again so soon, because if I am not mistaken, he only left the day before.</t3096> <t3097>I hope he and his sisters were well when you left London.</t3097>
<t3098>- Everything is normal, thank you.</t3098>
<t3099>She saw that she would not have any other answer, so after a moment, she continued:</t3099>
<t3100>- I have been informed that Mr. Bingley has no intention of returning to Netherfield, is that correct?</t3100>
<t3101>- I have never heard him say that, but maybe in the future, he will live less in that place.</t3101> <t3102>He has many friends, he is in a phase where friends and gatherings are continuously increasing.</t3102>
<t3103>- If he intends to rarely stay at Netherfield, it might be better for the neighbors if he returns the house entirely, because then we could have a family permanently settled there.</t3103> <t3104>But perhaps Mr. Bingley uses the house not for the convenience of the neighbors but for his own convenience, and we think he will keep or return the house based on that same principle.</t3104>
<t3105>- I wouldn't be surprised if he returns as soon as someone comes to rent.</t3105>
<t3106>Elizabeth did not answer.</t3106> <t3107>She did not want to talk much about his friend.</t3107> <t3108>Since there was nothing else to discuss, she decided to let him choose the topic.</t3108>
<t3109>I understand the idea, starting:</t3109>
<t3110>- This house seems very comfortable.</t3110> <t3111>I think Lady Catherine had contributed a lot here before Mr. Collins first came to Huntsford.</t3111>
<t3112>- I think that's right, I believe you cannot bestow a favor in a more precious way.</t3112>
<t3113>- Mr. Collins seems to be fortunate in choosing his wife.</t3113>
<t3114>- Yes, that's right.</t3114> <t3115>His relatives will be very happy to see him meet one of the rare women who is very knowledgeable and accepts him, or brings him happiness once they accept him.</t3115> <t3116>My friend has an excellent understanding – although I am not sure she made the wisest decision in agreeing to marry Mr. Collins.</t3116> <t3117>However, she seems completely happy, and from a cautious perspective, she has a very suitable marriage.</t3117>
<t3118>- It's quite a relief that she has stabilized her life within a very convenient distance from her family and friends.</t3118>
<t3119>- Do you think this is a very convenient distance? It's nearly fifty miles.</t3119>
<t3120>- And what if the fifty miles are good roads?</t3120> <t3121>It would only take a little more than half a day.</t3121> <t3122>Yes, I think this is a very convenient distance.</t3122>
<t3123>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t3123>
<t3124>- I have never considered distance to be an advantage in marriage.</t3124> <t3125>I have never said that Mrs. Collins has settled near her family.</t3125>
<t3126>- This is evidence of your attachment to Herfordshire.</t3126> <t3127>I suppose any place outside of Longbourn seems distant.</t3127>
<t3128>When he spoke, it seemed he smiled slightly, and Elizabeth thought she understood his implication.</t3128> <t3129>He must have guessed she was thinking about Jane and Netherfield, and her face flushed as she replied:</t3129>
<t3130>- I do not mean to say that a woman should not settle too close to her family.</t3130> <t3131>Far or near is only relative, depending on various circumstances.</t3131> <t3132>When conditions make travel costs not an issue, distance means nothing.</t3132> <t3133>But that is not the case here.</t3133> <t3134>Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but still not enough to travel frequently – and I believe my friend would not consider herself close to her family even if the distance were halved.</t3134>
<t3135>Mr. Darcy pulled the chair he was sitting on a little closer to her and said:</t3135>
<t3136>- You cannot be so attached to your place like that.</t3136> <t3137>You cannot live with Longbourn forever.</t3137>
<t3138>Elizabeth was surprised.</t3138> <t3139>The young man felt some change in his feelings.</t3139> <t3140>He pulled the chair back, picked up a newspaper from the table, and glanced through it, speaking in a cold voice:</t3140>
<t3141>- Do you like Kent?</t3141>
<t3142>A short conversation followed on the topic of the countryside, with each side calm and proper, until Charlotte and her sister walked in after a stroll.</t3142> <t3143>They were surprised to see the two facing each other.</t3143> <t3144>Mr. Darcy recounted how he had been mistaken and abrupt with Miss Bennet, and after sitting for a few more minutes without much conversation with anyone, he took his leave.</t3144>
<t3145>Charlotte said right after he walked away:</t3145>
<t3146>- What does that mean?</t3146> <t3147>Dear Eliza, he has fallen in love with you; otherwise, he would never visit you so intimately like this!</t3147>
<t3148>But when Elizabeth spoke of his silence, everyone felt it didn't seem to be the case, even Charlotte had a wish.</t3148> <t3149>After speculating on everything, they finally thought he visited just because he had nothing else to do, and that might be true for this time of year.</t3149> <t3150>All outdoor sports had ended.</t3150> <t3151>Inside was Lady Catherine, books, billiards table, but the young men couldn't be confined within four walls forever.</t3151> <t3152>Next door was the Parsonage, either the pleasure of walking there or because of the people living there, the two cousins found pleasure in walking there almost every day.</t3152> <t3153>The two came at different morning hours, sometimes separately, sometimes together, occasionally with their aunt.</t3153> <t3154>Everyone clearly saw that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he enjoyed their company; this thought made them like him even more.</t3154> <t3155>Elizabeth felt comfortable near him as well as seeing him like her, seeing him like Mr. George Wickham whom she once admired; and though in comparing the two, she found Colonel Fitzwilliam's gentle manners less captivating, she believed he might have higher knowledge.</t3155>
<t3156>But why Mr. Darcy often went to the Parsonage was more difficult to understand.</t3156> <t3157>It was not due to a fondness for socializing, as he would often sit for a full ten minutes without saying a word, and when he did speak, it seemed more out of necessity than spontaneity – a sacrifice to propriety rather than personal inclination.</t3157> <t3158>He was rarely lively.</t3158> <t3159>Mrs. Collins could not discern his character.</t3159> <t3160>Colonel Fitzwilliam sometimes joked about his peculiar manners, suggesting he was different, but Mrs. Collins could not make anything of it. When she wanted to believe that this change was due to love, the object of this love, her friend Eliza, would sit solemnly alone for him to observe.</t3160> <t3161>She watched him whenever they visited Rosings and whenever he came to Huntsford, but she could not understand his feelings.</t3161> <t3162>It was evident that he often looked at her friend, but the expression in his gaze was unfathomable.</t3162> <t3163>It was a serious, intent look; but she often wondered if there was any affection in it, and sometimes she saw nothing but indifference.</t3163>
<t3164>A few times, she let Elizabeth know that there was a possibility his feelings were leaning towards her, but Elizabeth always laughed off the idea.</t3164> <t3165>Mrs. Collins thought it best not to say more about this matter, as there was a risk of creating false hopes that would end in despair.</t3165>
<t3166>With good intentions for Elizabeth, sometimes she intended to help her marry Colonel Fitzwilliam.</t3166> <t3167>Obviously, he was the most amiable person, certainly liked her, and was fully qualified; but in return, with these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage from the church, while his cousin had none.</t3167>
<t3168>Chapter 33</t3168>
<t3169>A couple of times while wandering in the garden, Elizabeth happened to meet Mr. Darcy.</t3169> <t3170>She felt that unfortunate irony had led him to a place where no one else bothered to go.</t3170> <t3171>To prevent this from happening again, she informed him in advance that this path was her favorite.</t3171> <t3172>How this happened a second time was truly strange!</t3172> <t3173>Nevertheless, it happened, and it happened a third time.</t3173> <t3174>It seemed like a deliberate bad habit, or a voluntary act of remorse, because on these occasions, it wasn't just a few customary greetings and a moment of awkwardness before moving on, but rather he turned back to walk with her.</t3174> <t3175>He never said much, and she didn't bother to talk or listen much either, but she noticed during the third walk that he asked strange questions, unrelated to the conversation – about her impressions of staying at Huntsford, her thoughts on walking alone, her opinion on the happiness of Mr. and Mrs. Collins.</t3175> <t3176>When talking about Rosings, her lack of understanding about this residence, it seemed he intended that whenever she came to Kent, she would also stay there.</t3176> <t3177>His words carried this implication.</t3177> <t3178>Could he be thinking of Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She guessed, if he had any intention, he must be hinting at the possibility of it happening that way.</t3178> <t3179>This made her a bit uncomfortable, and she was glad to see that she had reached the gate of the garden opposite the Parsonage.</t3179>
<t3180>One day, while she was walking and pondering over Jane's latest letter, preoccupied with some passages that indicated Jane had not written with a calm mind, instead of being surprised once again by Mr. Darcy, she looked up and saw Colonel Fitzwilliam approaching.</t3180> <t3181>She quickly hid the letter and tried to smile:</t3181>
<t3182>- I didn't know beforehand that you also liked walking along this path.</t3182>
<t3183>He replied:</t3183>
<t3184>- I am making a round around the campus as per my annual habit, intending to conclude with a visit to the Parish Priest's Residence.</t3184> <t3185>Are you going any further?</t3185>
<t3186>- No, I intend to come back a little later.</t3186>
<t3187>Accordingly, she turned back, and the two of them walked together towards the Parish House.</t3187> <t3188>She asked:</t3188>
<t3189>- Are you sure you intend to leave Kent on Saturday?</t3189>
<t3190>- Yes, if Darcy doesn't postpone it again.</t3190> <t3191>But I depend on him.</t3191> <t3192>He arranges his work as he pleases.</t3192>
<t3193>- If he doesn't get things arranged to his liking, at least he will like having the right to decide.</t3193> <t3194>I have never known anyone who likes having the right to do as they please more than Mr. Darcy.</t3194>
<t3195>Colonel Fitzwilliam replied:</t3195>
<t3196>- He likes to do things his own way.</t3196> <t3197>But we all do.</t3197> <t3198>It's just that he has more means than others because he is rich, and many others are poor.</t3198> <t3199>I'm speaking emotionally.</t3199> <t3200>A young man must learn to get used to self-restraint and dependence.</t3200>
<t3201>- In my opinion, the young son of an Earl might know very little about many things.</t3201> <t3202>Now, seriously, what do you know about self-restraint and dependence?</t3202> <t3203>Have you ever been unable to go where you wanted or buy what you liked because of a lack of money?</t3203>
<t3204>- These are questions about family matters – and perhaps I have never experienced such hardships.</t3204> <t3205>But in more significant matters, I might still be lacking money.</t3205> <t3206>Young men cannot just marry whoever they want.</t3206>
<t3207>- Unless they like to marry wealthy women, and I think they often do.</t3207>
<t3208>- Our spending habits make us too dependent; not many people in my social class can get married without worrying about money.</t3208>
<t3209>Elizabeth thought, "Is this remark aimed at me?" and she blushed at the idea.</t3209> <t3210>But she composed herself and cheerfully said:</t3210>
<t3211>- Could you please tell me, what is the usual price for a young son of an Earl?</t3211> <t3212>Unless your cousin is ill, I guess you wouldn't ask for more than fifty thousand pounds.</t3212>
<t3213>He replied to her in a joking manner, and they stopped there.</t3213> <t3214>To break the silence that might make him think she was affected by the recent words, she said:</t3214>
<t3215>- I imagine your cousin brought you here mainly to have someone to boss around.</t3215> <t3216>I think he doesn't want to get married in order to enjoy this kind of freedom for a long time.</t3216> <t3217>But, perhaps his sister feels the same way, and since she is under his protection, he can do whatever he wants with her.</t3217>
<t3218>Colonel Fitzwilliam replied:</t3218>
<t3219>- No, this is an advantage that he has to share with me.</t3219> <t3220>I, along with him, protect Miss Darcy.</t3220>
<t3221>- Really? And may I ask, how do you protect her?</t3221> <t3222>Does she cause you any trouble?</t3222> <t3223>Young ladies at her age can sometimes be difficult to manage, so if she truly has the Darcy temperament, she might want to do things her own way.</t3223>
<t3224>When she spoke, she noticed that he was watching her intently, and the way he immediately asked her how she guessed that Miss Darcy might cause trouble for them made her think that somehow she had come close to the truth.</t3224> <t3225>She answered frankly:</t3225>
<t3226>- You don't need to worry.</t3226> <t3227>I have never heard anyone speak ill of her, and I am even certain that she is one of the most manageable creatures in the world.</t3227> <t3228>Many women I know, such as Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, are very fond of her.</t3228> <t3229>I think I heard that you know them.</t3229>
<t3230>- I am somewhat acquainted with them.</t3230> <t3231>Their younger brother is a pleasant person – he is close friends with Mr. Darcy.</t3231>
<t3232>Elizabeth is dry:</t3232>
<t3233>- Ah! Yes.</t3233> <t3234>Mr. Darcy is unusually kind to Mr. Bingley and takes great care of him.</t3234>
<t3235>- Take care of him! Yes, I believe that Darcy truly takes care of him in the matters he needs the most attention.</t3235> <t3236>According to what Darcy told me during this trip, I have reason to believe that Bingley owes him a lot.</t3236> <t3237>But I must apologize to him, for I should not assume that Bingley is the subject.</t3237> <t3238>It is all conjecture.</t3238>
<t3239>- What do you mean?</t3239>
<t3240>- This is a situation that Darcy naturally does not want everyone to know about, because if Lady's family finds out, it will be unpleasant.</t3240>
<t3241>- You can trust me not to reveal it.</t3241>
<t3242>- You should remember that I have little reason to guess that it was Mr. Bingley.</t3242> <t3243>What Darcy told me was simply this: he praised himself for having saved a friend from the troubles of a reckless marriage, but Darcy did not specify the name of the person or any other details.</t3243> <t3244>I only suspected it was Bingley because I believe Bingley is the type of young man who would behave foolishly like that, and because I know the two have been close throughout the past summer.</t3244>
<t3245>- Did Mr. Darcy tell you any reason why he wanted to get involved like that?</t3245>
<t3246>- I think the girl faced a lot of strong opposition.</t3246>
<t3247>- And what technique did he use to separate the two people?</t3247>
<t3248>Fitzwilliam smiled:</t3248>
<t3249>- He didn't tell me about his techniques.</t3249> <t3250>I told you everything he told me.</t3250>
<t3251>Elizabeth did not reply, continued walking, her mind filled with indignation.</t3251> <t3252>Watching her for a moment, Fitzwilliam asked why she seemed pensive.</t3252> <t3253>She said:</t3253>
<t3254>- I am thinking about what you told me.</t3254> <t3255>Your cousin's behavior does not align with my feelings. Why does he want to be a judge?</t3255>
<t3256>- Do you mean that his interference is a nuisance?</t3256>
<t3257>- I think Mr. Darcy has no right to judge whether his friend's feelings are right or wrong, or why he should determine and dictate how his friend should find happiness based solely on his own judgment.</t3257>
<t3258>She continued, calming down:</t3258>
<t3259>- But, since we don't know any details, condemning him is unfair.</t3259> <t3260>We cannot assume that there are many emotions involved in this case.</t3260>
<t3261>Fitzwilliam said:</t3261>
<t3262>- This is not a forced guess, but it sadly diminishes the glory of my cousin's victory.</t3262>
<t3263>He was only joking, but to her, that was exactly the image of Mr. Darcy.</t3263> <t3264>She thought it best not to respond, so she suddenly switched to other topics until they arrived at the Parsonage.</t3264>
<t3265>Right after the guest said goodbye, locking herself in her room, she could think without interruption about everything she had heard.</t3265> <t3266>It couldn't be said that he was referring to anyone other than those she knew.</t3266> <t3267>In this world, there couldn't be two people who had such a great influence on Mr. Darcy.</t3267> <t3268>She never doubted that Darcy was involved in measures to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, but she always thought that Miss Bingley was the main instigator.</t3268> <t3269>However, if his vanity didn't lead him astray, then he himself was the cause, his pride and impulsiveness were the reasons why Jane had suffered and continued to suffer.</t3269> <t3270>He had extinguished all hopes of happiness for the most earnest and generous heart, and no one could say how much more harm he would cause.</t3270>
<t3271>“The girl faces strong opposition” were the words of Colonel Fitzwilliam, and this strong opposition might come from her uncle who is a lawyer in the countryside and another uncle in London.</t3271>
<t3272>She thought, with Jane, there could be no issue of opposition.</t3272> <t3273>She is everything that is lovely and gentle! She has excellent understanding, an open mind, and graceful manners that captivate people.</t3273> <t3274>There is also nothing to criticize about her father, because although he is a bit eccentric, he has qualities that Mr. Darcy cannot disdain, and a respectable position that he cannot attain.</t3274> <t3275>When she thought of the mother, she felt a bit less confident, but she did not think any opposition here would carry weight with Mr. Darcy.</t3275> <t3276>She believed that his pride would be more severely wounded by his friend's lack of social standing than by their lack of awareness.</t3276> <t3277>Finally, she was convinced that he was partly influenced by his worst kind of pride, and partly by his desire to keep Mr. Bingley for his own sister.</t3277>
<t3278>The emotional turmoil and tears gave her a headache, and by the evening the symptoms had worsened to the point that she did not want to go to Rosings for the tea party, compounded by her reluctance to see Mr. Darcy.</t3278> <t3279>Mrs. Collins saw that she was indeed unwell and did not insist, trying to stop her husband from pressing her, but Mr. Collins could not hide his concern that Lady Catherine might be displeased.</t3279>
<t3280>Chapter 34</t3280>
<t3281>When they had gone, as if wanting to vent her anger on Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth took out and reviewed all the letters Jane had sent her since she went to visit in Kent.</t3281> <t3282>The letters contained no complaints, no recounting of past events or current suffering.</t3282> <t3283>But she noticed that every letter, and almost every line, was less cheerful, whereas her sister's writing was usually cheerful and truly calm, making it hard to disguise this change in tone.</t3283> <t3284>Elizabeth noticed that every phrase carried a sense of discomfort, which would not be noticed upon a first, cursory reading.</t3284> <t3285>Mr. Darcy's shameful boast about how he could inflict harm helped her clearly feel her sister's suffering.</t3285> <t3286>She found some comfort in thinking that his visit to Rosings would end in two days.</t3286> <t3287>A greater comfort was that within two weeks she would see Jane again, when she could help her sister recover her spirits with all the love she could muster.</t3287>
<t3288>She could not think of Mr. Darcy leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin would also be leaving with him.</t3288> <t3289>But Colonel Fitzwilliam had clearly shown no romantic interest in her, and although he was amiable, she would have no reason to be sad about his departure.</t3289>
<t3290>While she had already made up her mind, she suddenly heard the doorbell ring, and her spirits were somewhat agitated at the thought that it might be Colonel Fitzwilliam, as he had once visited in the evening and might be coming to inquire about her.</t3290> <t3291>But this thought quickly vanished, and her spirits were agitated in a different way.</t3291> <t3292>She was utterly surprised to see Mr. Darcy walk in.</t3292> <t3293>He hurriedly inquired about her health and expressed his wish to visit in hopes of knowing whether she had gotten any better.</t3293> <t3294>She responded in a politely cold manner.</t3294> <t3295>He sat for a moment, then stood up and walked around the room.</t3295> <t3296>Elizabeth was surprised, but did not say a word.</t3296> <t3297>After a few minutes of silence, he approached her in an agitated manner, and then began:</t3297>
<t3298>- I have struggled, but to no avail.</t3298> <t3299>There is nothing that can be done.</t3299> <t3300>I cannot do anything at all.</t3300> <t3301>I cannot control my emotions.</t3301> <t3302>You must allow me to tell you how deeply I have admired and loved you.</t3302>
<t3303>No words could describe Elizabeth's astonishment.</t3303> <t3304>She stared, face flushed, doubtful and silent.</t3304> <t3305>He considered this enough encouragement to continue expressing what had caused his feelings for her to blossom for a long time.</t3305> <t3306>He spoke coherently but with emotions beyond those of the heart that needed to be meticulously expressed, and on the subject of emotions, he was no more fluent than on the subject of pride.</t3306> <t3307>His awareness of her lower status – of the loss of dignity – and of the obstacles in the family that always opposed such feelings, was passionately presented by him; the passion seemed to stem more from being hurt than from the purpose of proposing.</t3307>
<t3308>Although she harbored deep resentment, she couldn't remain indifferent when a man confessed his feelings in such a manner, and although her intentions never wavered, at first she regretted that he would suffer, until, offended by his subsequent words, in a fit of anger she lost all compassion.</t3308> <t3309>However, she tried to remain calm so she could patiently respond to him when he finished.</t3309> <t3310>He concluded by confessing to her the intense feelings he couldn't subdue despite numerous efforts, and he expressed hope that she might now reciprocate his affection.</t3310> <t3311>As he said this, she could easily see that he was confident he would receive a satisfactory response.</t3311> <t3312>He spoke of anxiety, but his face radiated genuine confidence.</t3312> <t3313>Such a situation only made her angrier, so when he stopped, her face flushed, and she said:</t3313>
<t3314>- I believe that in cases like this, the usual manner is to express appreciation for the sentiments that have been disclosed, even if the response is not reciprocal.</t3314> <t3315>It is naturally necessary to be appreciative, and if my feelings were such, I could thank you now.</t3315> <t3316>But I cannot thank you – I have never desired your affection, and you have bestowed it in the most reluctant manner.</t3316> <t3317>I am sorry if I have caused anyone any pain.</t3317> <t3318>However, this was not intentional, and I hope it will pass quickly.</t3318> <t3319>The emotions that, as you said, have long prevented you from acknowledging your feelings, can also be soothed without much difficulty after this explanation.</t3319>
<t3320>Mr. Darcy, standing by the fireplace with his eyes fixed intently on her face, seemed to receive her words with irritation rather than surprise.</t3320> <t3321>His face turned pale with anger, the turmoil in his mind clearly reflected in his every expression.</t3321> <t3322>He was striving to appear calm, not wanting to speak until he had regained his composure.</t3322> <t3323>The moment of silence made Elizabeth feel utterly bored.</t3323> <t3324>Finally, in a voice that he tried to keep gentle, he said:</t3324>
<t3325>- And here is the answer I have been honored to await!</t3325> <t3326>Perhaps I want to know the reason why I was rejected with so little effort at courtesy like that.</t3326> <t3327>But this matter is not very important.</t3327>
<t3328>She replied:</t3328>
<t3329>- And I also want to ask why, with such a clear intention to insult and humiliate me, you want to tell me that you go against your will, against your reason, even against your nature, to love me?</t3329> <t3330>Is this an excuse for being rude, if I have been rude?</t3330> <t3331>But I have other provocations.</t3331> <t3332>You know that very well.</t3332> <t3333>If my feelings were not opposed to you, if I had different feelings, or even favorable feelings, do you think that any consideration would lead me to accept a person who intended to destroy, perhaps for the rest of their life, the happiness of the sister I love the most?</t3333>
<t3334>When she spoke these words, Mr. Darcy's complexion changed, but only momentarily.</t3334> <t3335>He listened to her without attempting to interrupt, while she continued:</t3335>
<t3336>- I have every reason in the world to think ill of you.</t3336> <t3337>No motivation can justify the unfair and narrow-minded role you have displayed here.</t3337> <t3338>You dare not deny, you cannot deny, that you are the key person, if not the only one, who has in the cruelest way separated two people, exposing one to the world's criticism for being fickle and inconsistent, exposing the other to public ridicule for shattered aspirations, and causing both to suffer.</t3338>
<t3339>She stopped and saw, along with the initial resentment, that he was listening with an expression that showed he had no intention of regretting.</t3339> <t3340>He even looked at her with a smile that expressed skepticism in his emotions.</t3340>
<t3341>She repeated:</t3341>
<t3342>- Can you deny that you did that?</t3342>
<t3343>He replied, seeming calm:</t3343>
<t3344>- I do not intend to deny that I did everything within my power to separate my friend from her sister, or deny that I was pleased to have succeeded.</t3344> <t3345>I was kinder to him than to myself.</t3345>
<t3346>Elizabeth despised the outward appearance of this manner of polite criticism, but she still grasped its essential meaning and did not wish to conform to it.</t3346> <t3347>She continued:</t3347>
<t3348>- But it is not just this matter that makes me hate you.</t3348> <t3349>Long before this, I already had thoughts about you in such a manner.</t3349> <t3350>Many months ago, Mr. Wickham told me about your true nature.</t3350> <t3351>Regarding this matter, what can you say?</t3351> <t3352>How can you defend yourself by imagining a friendly act?</t3352> <t3353>Or how do you wish to distort the truth for others to hear?</t3353>
<t3354>Darcy said in a less amiable tone, his face reddening further:</t3354>
<t3355>- She has been too concerned about his problems.</t3355>
<t3356>- If you know about his misfortunes, who wouldn't care?</t3356>
<t3357>Darcy scorned:</t3357>
<t3358>- His misfortunes! Yes, his misfortunes are truly great.</t3358>
<t3359>Elizabeth shouted loudly:</t3359>
<t3360>- And you caused it.</t3360> <t3361>You have driven him into his current state of misery, misery in a relative sense.</t3361> <t3362>You have taken hold of all the rights that you should have known were arranged for him.</t3362> <t3363>You have taken away the best years of his life, the independent life that he should have enjoyed.</t3363> <t3364>You did all these things! And on top of that, you scorn and mock when people mention his misfortunes.</t3364>
<t3365>Darcy exclaimed, as he paced quickly around the room:</t3365>
<t3366>- So that's what you think of me!</t3366> <t3367>That's how you judge me!</t3367> <t3368>Thank you for explaining it thoroughly.</t3368> <t3369>According to that reasoning, my faults are indeed severe!</t3369>
<t3370>He stopped walking and turned to look at her:</t3370>
<t3371>- But perhaps these faults would have been overlooked if her pride had not been hurt by my sincere confession of the long-standing hesitations that had prevented me from having serious intentions.</t3371> <t3372>These bitter accusations would have been restrained if I had tried harder to conceal the struggles within my soul, to make her complacently believe that I had been driven by unburdened, pure emotions; by reason, by recollection, by everything.</t3372> <t3373>But I hate concealing anything.</t3373> <t3374>And I am not ashamed of the feelings I have confessed.</t3374> <t3375>These feelings are natural and legitimate.</t3375> <t3376>Could she expect me to be happy in a lower position in relation to her?</t3376> <t3377>To expect me to congratulate myself on the hopes of relatives who are entirely lower in status than I am?</t3377>
<t3378>Elizabeth felt increasingly angry, but she tried her best to remain calm as she said:</t3378>
<t3379>- You were mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you thought that the manner of your proposal would affect me in any way other than one: I might have felt concern for you when I rejected you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanly manner.</t3379>
<t3380>She saw him seem to startle, but he remained silent.</t3380> <t3381>She continued:</t3381>
<t3382>- You cannot confess your feelings to me in any other way to try to make me accept you.</t3382>
<t3383>Once again, it was clear that he was stunned.</t3383> <t3384>He looked at her with a face that was both incredulous and embarrassed.</t3384> <t3385>She continued:</t3385>
<t3386>- Right from the beginning, it can almost be said that from the moment I first met him, his attitude made an impression on me that allowed me to clearly understand his arrogance, his haughtiness, and his despicable selfishness towards the feelings of others, to the point that this was the basis for my rejection of him. Then, subsequent events only made me hate him even more intensely, and in less than a month of knowing him, I thought he was the last person on earth I would want to marry.</t3386>
<t3387>- You have said enough.</t3387> <t3388>I completely understand your feelings, now I only feel ashamed of my previous thoughts.</t3388> <t3389>Forgive me for taking up so much of your time, and please accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.</t3389>
<t3390>He hurriedly stepped out of the room, and in a moment, Elizabeth heard him open the door and go outside.</t3390>
<t3391>Her mind was now in turmoil and intense pain.</t3391> <t3392>She did not know how to pull herself together; in her weakness, she sat down and cried for half an hour.</t3392> <t3393>The more she thought back on each past event, the more astonished she became.</t3393> <t3394>She had heard a proposal from Mr. Darcy! He had loved her for many months!</t3394> <t3395>He had loved her so passionately that he wanted to marry her despite all the opposition that had led him to prevent his friend from marrying her sister!</t3395> <t3396>And the opposition was just as strong in his own case.</t3396> <t3397>It was almost unbelievable! It was exhilarating to have unconsciously sparked such a passionate love.</t3397> <t3398>But his pride – his despicable pride, his shameless admission of how he treated Jane – his unforgivable confidence even if he could not justify it, and his indifference when he mentioned Mr. Wickham – his cruel actions towards him which he did not bother to deny, all exceeded her compassion when she thought of his feelings.</t3398>
<t3399>She continued to reminisce in her agitated thoughts until the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her think she could not hide from Charlotte's watchful eyes, and hurriedly ran back to her room.</t3399>
<t3400>Chapter 35</t3400>
<t3401>Elizabeth woke up the next morning with the same thoughts and reflections as when she had fallen asleep.</t3401> <t3402>She had not yet recovered from the astonishment of what had happened; she could not think of anything else.</t3402> <t3403>Unable to accomplish anything, after breakfast, she decided to get some fresh air and exercise.</t3403> <t3404>She went straight to the path she loved, where memories of Mr. Darcy occasionally stopped her, and instead of entering the garden, she turned onto the path that led her further away from the main road.</t3404> <t3405>The garden fence still marked the boundary on one side, and soon she passed through one of the gates leading to the open field.</t3405>
<t3406>After having walked two or three times along this section of the trail, the pleasant morning weather made her stop in front of the gates and linger in the garden.</t3406> <t3407>The five weeks she had spent in Kent had changed the scenery significantly, with the trees becoming greener each day.</t3407> <t3408>She was about to continue walking when she caught a glimpse of a young man in the bushes along the edge of the garden; he was walking towards her.</t3408> <t3409>Fearing it was Mr. Darcy, she turned back.</t3409> <t3410>But the man had come close enough to recognize her, quickly approached, and called her name.</t3410> <t3411>She had turned away, but upon hearing her name, even in Mr. Darcy's voice, she turned back towards the gate.</t3411> <t3412>At that moment, he also reached the gate, handed her a letter which she reflexively accepted, and spoke with an arrogant demeanor:</t3412>
<t3413>- I took a walk through some bushes hoping to meet you.</t3413> <t3414>Could you do me the honor of reading this letter?</t3414>
<t3415>And then, gently bowing his head in greeting, he walked towards the plantation; before long, he disappeared.</t3415>
<t3416>Not expecting any joy but with the greatest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and with increasing bewilderment, she found that the envelope contained two sheets of densely written paper.</t3416> <t3417>Even the envelope itself was quite thick.</t3417> <t3418>As she walked along the path, she began to read.</t3418> <t3419>The letter was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and read as follows:</t3419>
<t3420>“Dear Miss, you should not panic upon receiving this letter for fear that it reiterates the sentiments or pleads once more, all of which disgusted you last night.</t3420> <t3421>I write without the intention of causing you sorrow, nor with the intent of humbling myself by clinging to an unforgettably early desire, a desire for happiness for both of us.</t3421> <t3422>There would be no need to make the effort to write and read this letter if it were not necessary to express and understand my character.</t3422> <t3423>Therefore, you should forgive me for presumptuously demanding your attention.</t3423> <t3424>I know your sentiments will pay attention reluctantly, but I demand your attention due to your fair attitude.</t3424>
<t3425>"Last night you accused me of two charges of entirely different nature and unequal magnitude.</t3425> <t3426>The first charge is that, regardless of the feelings of each party, I separated Mr. Bingley from your sister; the other charge is that I ruined Mr. Wickham's immediate prosperity and shattered all his prospects, in defiance of all appeals, in defiance of honor and humanity.</t3426> <t3427>Deliberately and obstinately denying the friend of my youth, whom my father loved, a young man who had no other refuge than our patronage, who was raised to fend for himself.</t3427> <t3428>This is an unparalleled vile act, separating two young men whose affection could blossom in just a few weeks.</t3428>
<t3429>“But from the severe condemnation declared so liberally last evening, for each case, I hope in the future you will believe me, if you read through the explanations below about my behavior and motivations.</t3429> <t3430>If while explaining, I mention feelings that might upset you, I can only ask for your forgiveness.</t3430> <t3431>But I need to mention them, and if further apologies are unreasonable.</t3431>
<t3432>“When I first came to reside at Netherfield, like everyone else, I noticed that Mr. Bingley had more affection for your eldest sister than for any other young woman in the area.</t3432> <t3433>But it was only at the Netherfield ball that I realized the seriousness of his feelings.</t3433> <t3434>I have often seen him in love before.</t3434> <t3435>At that ball, while I had the honor of dancing with you, for the first time through Sir William Lucas, I learned that Mr. Bingley's attentions to your sister had raised hopes of a marriage between the two.</t3435> <t3436>He spoke of it as if it were a certainty, with only the date and time yet to be determined.</t3436>
<t3437>“From that moment, I paid close attention to my friend's behavior, and noticed that Bingley's feelings towards your sister exceeded anything I had ever witnessed in him.</t3437> <t3438>I also observed your sister.</t3438> <t3439>Her demeanor and gestures remained open, cheerful, and graceful as always, but there was no particular sign of affection, and after a thorough examination that evening, I believed that although she was happy to be noticed by him, she did not invite his attention by revealing any sentiments.</t3439> <t3440>If you are not mistaken here, I could be mistaken.</t3440> <t3441>You understand her better than I do, so I could be mistaken.</t3441> <t3442>If that is the case, if I am mistaken, and it causes her distress, you have every right to be angry.</t3442> <t3443>But I do not hesitate to assert that, regardless of how amiable her disposition may be, her feelings are not easily swayed, judging by the calmness in her expression and demeanor that a sensitive observer can detect.</t3443> <t3444>I sincerely want to believe that she is indifferent, but I must boldly add that my hopes or fears do not usually influence my understanding and decisions.</t3444> <t3445>It is not that I believe she is indifferent because I wish it so.</t3445> <t3446>I believe this based on impartial observation; as truly as if I had reason to wish otherwise.</t3446> <t3447>I oppose the marriage not merely for the sake of opposition, and last night I realized that it would take the strongest emotions to set aside these objections, in my case; if lacking, the relationship would not be bad for him but very bad for me.</t3447>
<t3448>“But the aversion has other causes that I myself want to forget because they are not apparent to me, although they still exist, and exist to the same degree in both Mr. Bingley's and my cases.</t3448> <t3449>I need to briefly mention these causes, though succinctly.</t3449> <t3450>Your family's circumstances, although uncomfortable, are insignificant compared to the material desires often manifested through your mother, your three younger sisters, and sometimes even your father.</t3450> <t3451>I apologize to you, I feel pained if I offend you.</t3451> <t3452>But when you and your sister show hesitation about the shortcomings of your relatives and displeasure at the manifestation of these shortcomings, please take comfort in knowing that your attitudes have avoided the criticism that others have faced, and have even earned you much praise, as well as making both your awareness and temperament worthy of respect.</t3452>
<t3453>“I can only add that, from what happened that evening, my opinion of everyone was determined, and I was further compelled to act to protect my friend from an unhappy marriage.</t3453> <t3454>As you may recall, I am sure, the next day he left Netherfield for London with the intention of returning soon.</t3454> <t3455>Now I will explain my actions.</t3455> <t3456>Both his sister and I were concerned, and soon we both realized this coincidence, both of us were aware that no time should be wasted in separating him, so we decided to go to London with him.</t3456> <t3457>There, I tried my best to point out to my friend the disadvantages of such a choice.</t3457> <t3458>I tried to persuade him earnestly.</t3458> <t3459>But even if this reproach might have caused him to hesitate or delay his decision, I do not believe it would have prevented the marriage, if not for your sister's indifferent attitude.</t3459> <t3460>Previously, he believed that she would reciprocate his feelings with sincere interest, if not equally.</t3460> <t3461>But Bingley is inherently shy, and he relied on my judgment more than his own.</t3461> <t3462>Therefore, convincing him that he had deceived himself was easy.</t3462> <t3463>Once I had made him believe it, urging him not to return to Hertfordshire was not difficult.</t3463>
<t3464>“I cannot blame myself for having acted to such an extent.</t3464> <t3465>In the entire matter, there is only one action of mine that I am dissatisfied with when I recall it, and that is that I lowered myself to use the art of concealing from you the fact that your sister was in town at that time.</t3465> <t3466>I knew this information, Miss Bingley knew it too, but Mr. Bingley did not know at all.</t3466> <t3467>It is possible that the two might meet without any harmful consequences, but I deemed that his feelings had not yet been entirely extinguished, so there was still a disadvantage in their meeting.</t3467> <t3468>Perhaps this concealment and disguise went against my nature.</t3468> <t3469>However, I did it, and did it in the hope of achieving the best outcome.</t3469> <t3470>On this matter, I have nothing more to say, no further apologies to offer.</t3470> <t3471>If I have caused your sister any pain, it was beyond my intention; and although the motives that guided me may not seem sufficient justification to you, I do not know how to condemn these motives.</t3471>
<t3472>“Regarding the heavier accusation, that I have harmed Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by explaining to you all the relations he has had with my family.</t3472> <t3473>He particularly accuses me of ignorance, but according to the truth I will present, I can call upon witnesses whose honesty is beyond dispute.</t3473> <t3474>Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who for many years managed all the estates at Pemberley, and due to his virtue in his work, he was highly trusted, so naturally my father helped him.</t3474> <t3475>As for George Wickham, my father was very kind to him, as he was practically his adopted son.</t3475> <t3476>My father supported his education up to Cambridge University.</t3476> <t3477>This support was even more important because his father was poor due to his wife's extravagant lifestyle and could not afford to educate him properly.</t3477> <t3478>My father not only cherished his always engaging company but also held him in high regard, hoping he would have a career in the church, so he intended to support him in this direction.</t3478> <t3479>As for me, it was only after many, many years that I began to think of him differently.</t3479> <t3480>The lowly talents and lack of principles that he carefully concealed from his closest friend could not escape the observation of someone nearly his age, who had opportunities to see him in unguarded moments.</t3480> <t3481>Here, once again, I am causing you pain, to what extent only you can know.</t3481> <t3482>But whatever feelings Mr. Wickham has stirred in you, the doubt about the nature of these feelings cannot prevent me from exposing his true character.</t3482>
<t3483>“I have another motivation as well.</t3483> <t3484>My father passed away about five years ago, and his affection for him remained so steadfast that in his will, which he specifically conveyed to me, it was stated that he would support the advancement that his profession allowed, and if he took holy orders, he would be given a substantial allowance from the family.</t3484> <t3485>There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds.</t3485> <t3486>His father passed away shortly after mine, within a year, and Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that he had finally decided not to take holy orders, and he hoped I could consider providing him with financial assistance immediately rather than waiting until he was appointed.</t3486> <t3487>He added that he intended to study law, and I had to admit that one thousand pounds would not be sufficient for him.</t3487> <t3488>I wished, rather than believed, that he was sincere.</t3488> <t3489>But in any case, I was willing to comply with his request.</t3489> <t3490>I knew that Mr. Wickham should not become a clergyman.</t3490> <t3491>Therefore, the matter was settled shortly thereafter.</t3491> <t3492>He declared that he would renounce any future claims to church support that he might be entitled to, and instead, he received three thousand pounds.</t3492> <t3493>All relations between us now seem to be dissolved.</t3493> <t3494>I thought so little of him that I did not want to invite him to Pemberley, nor associate with him in the city.</t3494> <t3495>I believe he lives mainly in the city, but studying law was just an excuse, and now free from all restraints, he lives idly and extravagantly.</t3495>
<t3496>"For about three years, I heard little news about him, but when the allowance he received ran out, he wrote to me asking for more.</t3496> <t3497>He persuaded me, and I had no difficulty believing him that he was in need.</t3497> <t3498>He found studying law to be unprofitable; now he was determined to be ordained, if I would transfer the remaining part of the allowance to him.</t3498> <t3499>He believed he was entitled to this because he knew I did not need to support anyone else, and I surely could not forget my grandfather's intentions.</t3499> <t3500>You cannot blame me for refusing his plea, or for rejecting all subsequent repeated requests.</t3500> <t3501>His resentment was as intense as his material deprivation, and surely he spoke ill of me to others as fiercely as he reproached me.</t3501>
<t3502>“After this period, all outward appearances of the relationship between the two of us were discarded.</t3502><t3503>I do not know how he managed to live.</t3503><t3504>But last summer, he again forced me to pay painful attention to him.</t3504><t3505>Now I must mention an event that I myself wish to forget, only because I am now compelled to reveal it.</t3505><t3506>In such a lengthy manner, I think I can trust you to keep this matter confidential.</t3506><t3507>My sister Georgiana, who is more than ten years younger than I, was entrusted to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.</t3507><t3508>About a year ago, she left school, a residence was established for her in London, and she, along with the manager of this residence, went to Ramsgate, from where she sought out Mr. Wickham.</t3508><t3509>Surely this was premeditated, as he and Mrs. Younge had known each other previously.</t3509><t3510>She deceived us sadly; through her collusion and assistance, he courted Georgiana.</t3510><t3511>My sister's tender heart was strongly impressed by his kindness to a child, to the point that she was persuaded she loved him and agreed to elope with him.</t3511><t3512>At that time, she was only fifteen, so this was an excuse to run away, and after mentioning her imprudence, I am pleased to add that I learned of this through her.</t3512><t3513>I met the two of them one or two days before they planned to elope.</t3513><t3514>Georgiana, not wanting to cause her brother, whom she also viewed as a father, distress and offense, confessed everything to me.</t3514><t3515>You can imagine what I thought and how I acted.</t3515><t3516>For the sake of my sister's dignity and feelings, I kept the matter confidential, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, and of course, Mrs. Younge was dismissed.</t3516><t3517>Surely Mr. Wickham's aim was my sister's fortune, about thirty thousand pounds, but I cannot help but guess that a desire for revenge against me was also a strong motivating factor.</t3517><t3518>Indeed, his revenge could have been complete.</t3518>
<t3519>"Miss, I have recounted every event truthfully that pertains to both of us.</t3519> <t3520>If you do not dismiss the story as falsehood, I hope you will retract your accusation of my cruel treatment towards Mr. Wickham.</t3520> <t3521>I am not sure how he has influenced you, with what deceitful words, but it is likely that he has succeeded.</t3521> <t3522>Previously, you knew nothing of these matters, you had no means to investigate, and certainly, you had no inclination to doubt.</t3522> <t3523>You may wonder why I did not recount all these events last night.</t3523> <t3524>But at that time, I could not maintain the composure to know what could or should be said.</t3524> <t3525>Regarding the truth behind what I have recounted here, I can call upon Colonel Fitzwilliam as a witness.</t3525> <t3526>As he is closely related and lives in proximity to us, still being an executor of my father's will, he could not help but be well aware of all the details.</t3526> <t3527>If you despise me so bitterly that all my explanations are worthless, you can still confide in my cousin, and since you may have the opportunity to seek his opinion, I have endeavored to find a chance to deliver this letter to you this morning.</t3527>
<t3528>“I only have one more thing to say: may God bless you.”</t3528> <t3529>Fitzwilliam Darcy</t3529>
<t3530>Chapter 36</t3530>
<t3531>When Mr. Darcy handed her the letter, Elizabeth had not expected him to propose to her again, nor could she anticipate its contents.</t3531> <t3532>But she eagerly read it, and the letter caused conflicting emotions within her.</t3532> <t3533>She could not clearly define her thoughts as she read through the letter.</t3533> <t3534>At first, she was surprised to understand that he believed he had the ability to apologize to her, and she remained firmly convinced that he had no explanation that could justify his shameful behavior.</t3534> <t3535>With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began with the explanation of what had happened at Netherfield. She eagerly read, but in her impatience to know what the next sentence said, she could not clearly grasp what she was reading.</t3535> <t3536>She immediately assumed that his belief in her sister's indifference was wrong, and his explanation of the strong objections made her too angry to consider him impartially.</t3536> <t3537>He did not show any regret for what he had done; his manner was not repentant but arrogant.</t3537> <t3538>It was all pride and insolence.</t3538>
<t3539>But when he mentioned Mr. Wickham, as she read more attentively, the events, if true, would surely dispel all her good feelings about his worth.</t3539> <t3540>Her feelings became more painful and harder to define.</t3540> <t3541>She was extremely surprised, worried, even horrified.</t3541> <t3542>She wanted to reject everything, constantly shouting: "This is not right!</t3542> <t3543>It can't be like this! This is nonsense!" And when she had finished reading the letter, though she remembered nothing of the last one or two pages, she hurriedly folded the letter, convinced that she should not believe it, that she would never read it again.</t3543>
<t3544>In such a state of mental turmoil, with intentions not knowing where to cling, she continued to walk.</t3544> <t3545>But she could not control herself, opened the letter again, trying to calm herself in her distressed state, and read everything about Wickham again, examining the meaning in each sentence.</t3545> <t3546>The letter's account of Mr. Wickham's relationship with the Pemberly family was just as he had told.</t3546> <t3547>The kindness of the late Mr. Darcy was also as he had said, though she had not known it well before.</t3547> <t3548>Up to this point, everything matched, but when she read the part about the will, there was a significant difference.</t3548> <t3549>She still remembered the allowance that Wickham mentioned, and when pondering each word he said, she couldn't help but think that either one or the other had behaved deceitfully, and for a moment she was proud that she had not been mistaken.</t3549> <t3550>But as she continued to read, then carefully reread, the subsequent details about Wickham renouncing all claims to the support, instead accepting a sum of three thousand pounds, made her uneasy.</t3550> <t3551>She put the letter down, considering every situation she thought was fair – cautious about the assumptions in each sentence – but she could not reach a conclusion.</t3551> <t3552>Each side was adamant about what they said.</t3552> <t3553>She read on.</t3553> <t3554>But each line showed more clearly that the matter, which she had believed no scheme could present in such a way as to make Mr. Darcy appear not too bad, had taken a step or made him completely innocent.</t3554>
<t3555>The extravagance and liberality that he had unhesitatingly accused Mr. Wickham of shocked her, even more so because she saw no evidence of any injustice.</t3555><t3556>She had never heard of Mr. Wickham before he joined the military at the persuasion of her young brother, who had rekindled a superficial acquaintance upon meeting him again in the city.</t3556><t3557>No one in Hertfordshire knew anything about his previous life except for what he himself had said.</t3557><t3558>She never wanted to inquire about his true character.</t3558><t3559>His face, voice, and gestures all immediately confirmed every virtue of his.</t3559><t3560>She tried to recall a few virtues, a few unique traits of integrity or benevolence that could help defend him against Mr. Darcy's accusations, or at least could excuse the common faults, as she thought, that Mr. Darcy had described as laziness and long-standing vices.</t3560><t3561>But she could not remember anything like that.</t3561><t3562>She could see him right before her, every manner and word captivating, but she could not recall any substantial point of his virtues, except for the approval of neighbors and the affection due to his social skills among the guests.</t3562><t3563>After a moment of pondering this point, she continued reading.</t3563><t3564>But, alas! The subsequent story about his intentions towards Miss Darcy, partially confirmed by the conversation she had with Colonel Fitzwilliam the previous morning, and finally substantiated in every detail by Colonel Fitzwilliam himself – who had informed her of his concerns about his cousin's actions, a man whose integrity she had no reason to doubt.</t3564><t3565>For a moment she decided she would ask him about it, but the intention wavered because she felt awkward bringing it up.</t3565><t3566>Ultimately, she dismissed the idea altogether, convinced that Mr. Darcy would never risk making such a proposal unless he was certain his cousin would corroborate his account.</t3566>
<t3567>She clearly remembered everything that was exchanged between Wickham and her on the evening they first met at Mr. Phillips' house.</t3567> <t3568>Many of his words were still vividly imprinted in her memory.</t3568> <t3569>Now she was startled to think that speaking in such a manner to a stranger was improper, and she wondered why she hadn't realized this before.</t3569> <t3570>She thought he lacked tact when presenting himself in that way, and his statements and actions were inconsistent.</t3570> <t3571>She remembered that he had boasted that he was not afraid to meet Mr. Darcy, that Mr. Darcy could leave but he would stay; yet, he had avoided the ball at Netherfield the following week.</t3571> <t3572>She also remembered that, until the Netherfield family left, he had only told his story to her and no one else, but after they left, the story was discussed everywhere.</t3572> <t3573>She thought he had not hesitated at all, not even for a moment, to seek to undermine Mr. Darcy's character, even though he had reassured her that out of respect for the late gentleman, he would never expose the son.</t3573>
<t3574>Everything related to him has now changed! His attention to Miss King is now merely a consequence of pure greed and a desire for revenge, and her meager fortune indicates that his aspirations are no longer moderate but driven by a keen eagerness to seize anything.</t3574> <t3575>His attitude towards her now cannot be motivated by anything acceptable; either he is disappointed by her poor fortune, or his vanity has been satisfied after he aroused the affection that she believed she had shown imprudently.</t3575> <t3576>All ideas of justifying him are gradually fading away.</t3576> <t3577>Through Mr. Darcy's explanation, she had to accept that Mr. Bingley, when asked by Jane, had long believed he was not at fault in the matter.</t3577> <t3578>She realized that, throughout the time Mr. Darcy and she had a relationship that eventually brought them closer and allowed her to know his lifestyle well, although he was proud and unpleasant, she had never seen anything that indicated he lacked principles or fairness.</t3578> <t3579>Anything that indicated irreligious or immoral habits.</t3579> <t3580>In his social interactions, he was respected and highly regarded – even Wickham had considered him a brother; she had often heard him speak affectionately about his sister; all of which indicated he had some amiable sentiments.</t3580> <t3581>If his actions were as Wickham described, a blatant violation of all that is right could hardly be concealed from anyone, and the friendship between a person capable of forming bonds and someone as charming as Mr. Bingley; all of it was incomprehensible.</t3581>
<t3582>She felt completely ashamed of herself.</t3582> <t3583>She could not think of Darcy or Wickham without the idea that she had been blind, prejudiced, unjust, foolish.</t3583>
<t3584>She exclaimed: "I have acted in such a despicable manner!</t3584> <t3585>I have been proud of my own awareness!</t3585> <t3586>I have overestimated my own abilities!</t3586> <t3587>I have looked down on my sister's genuine and generous nature, satisfying my own vanity with useless or condemnable suspicion.</t3587> <t3588>How shameful it is to have realized this!</t3588> <t3589>Indeed, it is only shame! If I had known love, I could not have been so miserably blind! But vanity, not love, has always been my folly.</t3589> <t3590>Moved by one person's kindness and offended by another's indifference, from the very beginning of my acquaintance with him, I have been full of prejudices, foolishness, always rejecting all reason.</t3590> <t3591>From the start until now, I have never truly recognized my own self."</t3591>
<t3592>From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts all converged to remind her that what Mr. Darcy explained here seemed to lack many things, so she read the letter again.</t3592> <t3593>This time the effect was very different – how could she dismiss his words in one situation, while believing them in another?</t3593> <t3594>He said he knew nothing of her sister's feelings, while she could not forget the remark about her sister that Charlotte still held in her mind.</t3594> <t3595>Nor could she dismiss his description of Jane.</t3595> <t3596>She thought that her sister expressed very little emotion even though her feelings were deep, and that her sister's attitude and gestures always exuded a sense of self-satisfaction, not well aligned with extreme sensitivity.</t3596>
<t3597>When she read the part about her family, with its reproachful but justified tone, she felt even more ashamed.</t3597> <t3598>The impartial comment struck her consciousness so heavily that she could not deny it.</t3598> <t3599>The situations he specifically alluded to, such as what happened at the Netherfield ball, seemed to confirm everything he disapproved of, leaving a stronger impression on her mind than on his.</t3599>
<t3600>She did not overlook his praise for her and her sister.</t3600> <t3601>This helped her feel soothed, but it could not console her for the disdain towards the rest of the family.</t3601> <t3602>When she considered that Jane had been disappointed solely because of the attitude of their dearest relatives, and when she thought about how the reputation of those two had been harmed by such improper conduct, she felt a sorrow she had never experienced before.</t3602>
<t3603>After wandering along the path for two hours, indulging in every thought, reviewing events, determining possibilities, and trying to reconcile herself with the sudden and significant upheaval, fatigue and the sudden realization that she had been absent for quite a while made her turn back.</t3603> <t3604>She entered the house with the desire to appear cheerful as usual, and the firm intention to suppress the thoughts that made it difficult for her to converse with anyone.</t3604>
<t3605>She was informed that the two gentlemen from Rosings had visited while she was away.</t3605> <t3606>Mr. Darcy stayed only a few minutes, but Colonel Fitzwilliam had sat down for at least an hour, hoping she would return in time, almost wanting to go find her.</t3606> <t3607>Elizabeth could only feel concerned that she would miss him; in fact, she was happy about it.</t3607> <t3608>Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer the subject, she could only think about the letter.</t3608>
<t3609>Chapter 37</t3609>
<t3610>The two young men left Rosings the next morning.</t3610> <t3611>After arriving at the place where the two were staying to bid farewell, Mr. Collins returned and happily reported to everyone that they were still in good health and in as good spirits as could be expected after the recent sorrowful events at Rosings.</t3611> <t3612>Then he hurried to Rosings to comfort Lady Catherine and her daughter.</t3612> <t3613>When he returned, with a look of complete satisfaction, he conveyed Lady Catherine's message that she felt quite lonely and was very eager to invite everyone to dinner.</t3613>
<t3614>Elizabeth could not meet Lady Catherine without the thought that, if she wished, this time she could come to see her as her future niece-in-law.</t3614> <t3615>And she could not avoid the thought, with a smile, of her indignant reaction.</t3615> <t3616>She found it amusing to ask herself: “What would she say?</t3616> <t3617>How would she behave?”</t3617>
<t3618>Their first topic was the event that the two people had missed.</t3618> <t3619>Lady Catherine said:</t3619>
<t3620>- I hope you understand that I feel very deeply.</t3620> <t3621>I believe that no one feels the separation from loved ones as I do.</t3621> <t3622>But I am particularly attached to these two young men, and I know they are also attached to me! They are infinitely sad to say goodbye.</t3622> <t3623>But they have always been like that.</t3623> <t3624>The Colonel tried to stay cheerful until the last moment, but Darcy seemed somewhat sadder; I think he is sadder than last year.</t3624> <t3625>Surely he has felt more attached to Rosings.</t3625>
<t3626>Mr. Collins offered words of praise and added a hint, causing the mother and daughter to smile gently.</t3626>
<t3627>After the meal, Lady Catherine remarked that Miss Bennet seemed depressed, and immediately assumed that she did not want to return home too early.</t3627> <t3628>She added:</t3628>
<t3629>- If that's true, you must immediately write a letter to your mother asking her to allow you to stay a little longer.</t3629> <t3630>I am sure Mrs. Collins will be very happy to have your company.</t3630>
<t3631>Elizabeth replied:</t3631>
<t3632>- I greatly appreciate the Lady's kind invitation, but I cannot accept.</t3632> <t3633>I have to return to the city next Saturday.</t3633>
<t3634>- That way, you will only be able to stay here for six weeks.</t3634> <t3635>I had hoped you could stay for two months.</t3635> <t3636>I told Mrs. Collins that before you came here.</t3636> <t3637>There can't be anything that makes you leave in such a hurry.</t3637> <t3638>Mrs. Bennet will surely allow you to stay for another two weeks.</t3638>
<t3639>- But my father does not allow it.</t3639> <t3640>Last week he wrote me a letter, telling me I must return in time.</t3640>
<t3641>- Ah! Your father will certainly allow you, if your mother has already agreed.</t3641> <t3642>Daughters are never important to fathers.</t3642> <t3643>If you stay for a whole month, I will have the opportunity to take you all the way to London, because I will be going there in June and staying for a week.</t3643> <t3644>If Dawson agrees, one of you will have a comfortable room.</t3644> <t3645>In fact, if the weather turns cold, I wouldn't mind taking both of you, since you are both quite petite.</t3645>
<t3646>- Madam, you are really kind, but we have to follow the planned schedule.</t3646>
<t3647>Lady Catherine seemed to have to accept it.</t3647>
<t3648>- Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant to accompany the two girls.</t3648> <t3649>You know, I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the thought of just two young girls going together.</t3649> <t3650>That is not proper at all.</t3650> <t3651>I do not like to see this at all.</t3651> <t3652>Young women should always have someone to protect and care for them, depending on their circumstances.</t3652> <t3653>When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last year, I pointed out that two servants should go with her.</t3653> <t3654>Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberly, and Lady Ann cannot go out properly in any other way.</t3654> <t3655>I am very attentive to this matter.</t3655> <t3656>Mrs. Collins, you need to send John with the girls.</t3656> <t3657>I am glad to remember to remind you of this, for you will lose your reputation if you let the two girls go alone.</t3657>
<t3658>- My uncle will send a servant to pick us up.</t3658>
<t3659>- Ah! Your uncle! He has a male servant, doesn't he?</t3659> <t3660>I am very pleased that you ladies have thought of this.</t3660> <t3661>Where will you change horses? Ah, Bromley, of course.</t3661> <t3662>If you mention my name at Bell, they will take care of you.</t3662>
<t3663>Mrs. Catherine asked many more questions about the journey of the two ladies, and since Elizabeth could not answer all the questions herself, she had to pay attention, and she found herself fortunate.</t3663> <t3664>Because, with a mind full of worries, she almost forgot where she was.</t3664> <t3665>Thoughts should be reserved for solitary moments; whenever she was alone, she considered this the best solace.</t3665> <t3666>Every day she had a solitary walk, during which she could indulge in the pleasure of not-so-pleasant recollections.</t3666>
<t3667>Before long, she had memorized Mr. Darcy's letter.</t3667> <t3668>She pondered over each sentence, and her feelings towards the writer changed greatly over time.</t3668> <t3669>When she recalled his manner of speaking, she was still full of indignation.</t3669> <t3670>But when she thought of how unjustly she had condemned and scolded him, she was angry at herself; his feelings became an object of her compassion.</t3670> <t3671>She was glad that he loved her; she respected his character, but could not accept him; and at no time did she regret rejecting him, nor did she have any fleeting desire to see him again.</t3671> <t3672>In her past behavior, there were always sources of annoyance and regret; and the shortcomings of her family were a matter that caused her even more distress.</t3672> <t3673>She felt hopeless to remedy it.</t3673> <t3674>Her father only wanted to joke and never restrained the frivolity of the young daughters.</t3674> <t3675>Her mother, with attitudes that were still improper, was completely insensitive to the harm.</t3675> <t3676>Elizabeth often tried with Jane to control the impulsiveness of Catherine and Lydia, but while their mother indulged them, what chance was there for the two to improve?</t3676> <t3677>Catherine, with her weak and irritable nature, always being led by Lydia, was always displeased with her sisters' advice. Lydia, with her self-willed and careless disposition, rarely listened to them.</t3677> <t3678>Both were foolish, lazy, and empty-headed.</t3678> <t3679>As long as there were officers in Meryton, the two would continue to flirt with them; as long as Meryton was just a walk away from Longbourn, they would always go there.</t3679>
<t3680>Another concern was worrying about Jane.</t3680> <t3681>Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to her good graces, made her understand what Jane had lost.</t3681> <t3682>His feelings were proven to be sincere, his behavior showed nothing to criticize, except that he might be faulted for relying too much on his friend's opinion.</t3682> <t3683>She felt even more compassion when she thought that, with a situation favorable in every way, full of advantages, full of promises of happiness, Jane was deprived of it all, just because her own family had been too foolish and impolite!</t3683>
<t3684>When Wickham's true nature was added to this recollection, the previously seldom suppressed happy sentiments were now so heavily affected that she could hardly even pretend to be relatively cheerful.</t3684>
<t3685>The social gatherings at Rosings remained frequent during the last week of her stay, just as frequent as during the first week.</t3685> <t3686>On the evening of the last day, they went to the Lady's residence, where she once again inquired thoroughly about the two girls' journey and gave instructions on how to arrange their luggage.</t3686> <t3687>She spoke urgently about the necessity of arranging evening dresses in the only way she deemed correct, to the extent that Maria thought she would unpack all her luggage to rearrange it upon returning.</t3687>
<t3688>When they bid farewell, Lady Catherine, with extreme humility, wished the two ladies a pleasant journey and invited them to visit Huntsford again the following year.</t3688> <t3689>As for Miss De Bourgh, she merely nodded and shook hands with the two ladies.</t3689>
<t3690>Chapter 38</t3690>
<t3691>On Saturday morning, Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for a few minutes before the others appeared, and he took the opportunity to express a few polite words of farewell that he thought were very necessary.</t3691> <t3692>He said:</t3692>
<t3693>- Miss Elizabeth, I am not sure if Mrs. Collins has expressed her feelings about your kind visit to us, but I am certain she will thank you when you leave.</t3693> <t3694>Please believe that we are very touched by your group's visit to us.</t3694> <t3695>We think our humble abode has nothing attractive to visitors.</t3695> <t3696>Our simple way of living, the small rooms, few servants; and since we seldom go out to explore the outside world, all of this surely makes Huntsford completely boring for a young lady like you.</t3696> <t3697>But I hope you will believe that we have been very happy to humble ourselves, and we have done everything we can to make your time here pleasant.</t3697>
<t3698>Elizabeth eagerly responded with thanks and reassured him that she was satisfied.</t3698> <t3699>She had spent six weeks in happiness and was pleased to have Charlotte's company; the attentions given to her made her very appreciative.</t3699> <t3700>Mr. Collins was delighted, and with a more solemn yet cheerful demeanor, he replied:</t3700>
<t3701>- I am very pleased to hear that your stay here has not been too unpleasant.</t3701> <t3702>We certainly did our best; fortunately, we had the circumstances to introduce you to a very distinguished society, and from our relationship with Rosings, which provides a change of atmosphere compared to our humble home, I think we can be satisfied that your visit to Huntsford was not too dull.</t3702> <t3703>Our circumstances in relation to Lady Catherine's family are indeed an exceptional advantage and fortune that few possess.</t3703> <t3704>You have seen what our status is like.</t3704> <t3705>You have seen how frequently we interact with them.</t3705> <t3706>Honestly, I must admit that, with the disadvantages of the humble Parsonage here, I did not dare to think that anyone would be kind enough to come to this place, while on the contrary, they are eager to share in our private moments at Rosings.</t3706>
<t3707>Words could never suffice to elevate his ideas, so he had to pace around the room while Elizabeth tried to blend politeness and truth into a few short sentences.</t3707> <t3708>He continued:</t3708>
<t3709>- My dear cousin, in fact, you can tell Herfordshire all the favorable things about us.</t3709> <t3710>I take pride in the fact that at least you can do this.</t3710> <t3711>Every day you have witnessed Lady Catherine paying special attention to Mrs. Collins, and generally, I believe your friend does not seem to be without troubles, but we should remain silent about this.</t3711> <t3712>My dear Elizabeth, I just want to assure you that deep down I sincerely wish you the utmost happiness in marriage.</t3712> <t3713>My beloved Charlotte and I share the same sentiments and thoughts.</t3713> <t3714>In everything, we are extraordinarily compatible with each other in both character and feelings.</t3714> <t3715>It seems as if we were born to live for each other.</t3715>
<t3716>Elizabeth said moderately that it was a great happiness in such a situation, with the same sincere tone, she added that she firmly believed and was glad about the comforts in his family.</t3716> <t3717>However, she did not regret seeing the account of these comforts interrupted because the person they were talking about stepped in.</t3717> <t3718>Poor Charlotte! It was indeed sad to let her live among such people! But she had chosen this with a clear intention, and obviously, she was sad because the guests were about to leave, as if she did not want anyone to pity her.</t3718> <t3719>Her house and her housekeeping, her parish and her flock of chickens, and all their dependent relationships, had not yet lost their charm.</t3719>
<t3720>Finally, the carriage arrived, the luggage was securely tied to the vehicle, the packages were loaded in the middle, and then it was announced that everything was ready.</t3720> <t3721>After heartfelt goodbyes, Mr. Collins escorted Elizabeth to the carriage.</t3721> <t3722>As they passed through the flower garden, he sent his most respectful regards to her family, not forgetting to thank them for the kindness he received during the winter at Longbourn, and extended his greetings to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, even though he had not yet met them.</t3722> <t3723>Then he helped Elizabeth into the carriage, with Maria following behind, and just as the door was about to close, he suddenly, with some anxiety, reminded the two ladies that they had forgotten to send their regards to the women at Rosings.</t3723> <t3724>He added:</t3724>
<t3725>- But of course, she will send them humble respects to thank them for their kindness during her time here.</t3725>
<t3726>Elizabeth agreed, then the door closed, and the car drove away.</t3726>
<t3727>Maria exclaimed, after a few moments of silence:</t3727>
<t3728>- My goodness! It seems like we've only been here for a few days!</t3728> <t3729>And yet so many things have happened!</t3729>
<t3730>Elizabeth sighed:</t3730>
<t3731>- Indeed, many things have happened.</t3731>
<t3732>- We have dined at Rosings nine times, besides having tea twice! I will have so many stories to tell.</t3732>
<t3733>In her heart, Elizabeth added: "And you will have so many more things to keep secret.</t3733><t3734>"</t3734>
<t3735>The two ladies spoke little to each other during the trip.</t3735> <t3736>Within four hours, they arrived at Mr. Gardiner's house, where they stayed for a few days.</t3736>
<t3737>Jane appeared to be in good health, but amidst the gatherings that their aunt organized for them, Elizabeth had little opportunity to understand her sister's feelings.</t3737> <t3738>However, Jane would return home with her, and at Longbourn, there would be plenty of time to observe.</t3738>
<t3739>But while waiting, with a little effort, Elizabeth told her sister about Mr. Darcy's proposal.</t3739> <t3740>Knowing that she had the ability to reveal something that would astonish Jane greatly, while simultaneously making her pleased with her own frivolity which she could not yet explain – this was what prompted her to confide in her sister, except for the hesitation about how much to reveal and her fear of acting rashly like Bingley, which would cause her sister further distress.</t3740>
<t3741>Chapter 39</t3741>
<t3742>In the second week of May, three young girls traveled together from Gracechurch Street to Hertfordshire.</t3742> <t3743>As they approached an inn that served as a meeting point where Mr. Bennet's carriage would pick them up, they saw Kitty and Lydia looking down from the dining room upstairs.</t3743> <t3744>The two had arrived more than an hour earlier, delighting in shopping at a hat store, watching the guards on duty, and enjoying a vinegar-dressed salad.</t3744>
<t3745>After the greetings, the two girls proudly presented a table already set with cold food, exclaiming, "Looks delicious, doesn't it?"</t3745> <t3746>"Aren't you surprised and delighted?" Lydia added.</t3746>
<t3747>- We will treat you, but you have to lend us money because we spent all our money at the shop over there.</t3747>
<t3748>Then she showed some items:</t3748>
<t3749>- Look here, I bought this hat.</t3749> <t3750>I think it's not very pretty, but it's better to buy it than not.</t3750> <t3751>I'll fix it when I get home, to see if it looks better.</t3751>
<t3752>When the older sisters had words of criticism, she indifferently continued:</t3752>
<t3753>- Ah! But there are a few that are much worse.</t3753> <t3754>When I bought some satin fabric to make the trim, I thought it looked okay.</t3754> <t3755>Moreover, it won't matter this summer, after the militia unit leaves Meryton, they will be gone in two weeks.</t3755>
<t3756>Elizabeth exclaimed, in utmost satisfaction:</t3756>
<t3757>- Are they really going to go?</t3757>
<t3758>- They will camp near Brington; I really want papa to take all of us there this summer! It will be a wonderful plan, and I am sure it won't cost much.</t3758> <t3759>Mother will also want to go for any reason.</t3759>
<t3760>Elizabeth thought: "Indeed, this will be a wonderful plan, making everyone happy at once."</t3760> <t3761>My God! Brington, adding a military camp to those already shaken by a miserable regiment and the monthly balls at Meryton."</t3761>
<t3762>Lydia said, as the sisters sat down at the dining table:</t3762>
<t3763>- Now I have some news for you all.</t3763> <t3764>Try to guess! This is extremely good news, important news, related to a person we all cherish.</t3764>
<t3765>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, the waiter had been told not to attend to them closely.</t3765> <t3766>Lydia laughed, and said:</t3766>
<t3767>- Ah, both sisters are still serious and cautious.</t3767> <t3768>The two sisters think it’s not necessary to let the servant know, as if he really wants to know!</t3768> <t3769>I think surely he often hears worse news than what I’m about to reveal.</t3769> <t3770>But he is so ugly! I’m glad he’s gone.</t3770> <t3771>In my life, I’ve never seen anyone with such a long chin.</t3771> <t3772>Alright, now here’s the news I want to announce; it’s about Mr. Wickham, too good for him, isn’t it?</t3772> <t3773>There’s no danger of Wickham marrying Miss Mary King. He’s yours!</t3773> <t3774>She has gone with her uncle to Liverpool and will stay there permanently.</t3774> <t3775>Wickham is safe.</t3775>
<t3776>Elizabeth added:</t3776>
<t3777>- And Mary King is safe!</t3777> <t3778>Safe from a reckless marriage in terms of fortune.</t3778>
<t3779>- She was foolish to leave if she liked him.</t3779>
<t3780>Jane said:</t3780>
<t3781>- But she hopes that neither side remains attached.</t3781>
<t3782>- I'm sure he doesn't have any attachment.</t3782> <t3783>You can answer about this, that he doesn't care about her.</t3783> <t3784>Who would care about such a freckled and ugly person!</t3784>
<t3785>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, although she did not have the ability to express such rudeness, the rudeness in her feelings in this way was no different than if her breasts were freely exposed!</t3785>
<t3786>After they had finished eating and the older sisters had paid, they called the driver and loaded all the luggage, boxes, bags, along with the items Kitty and Lydia had bought that no one liked.</t3786> <t3787>Lydia exclaimed:</t3787>
<t3788>- How wonderful it is to stack them up! I'm glad I bought the hat, not just because I got an extra box!</t3788> <t3789>Now let's be comfortable and cozy, feel free to chat and laugh along the way back.</t3789> <t3790>First of all, please tell me what has happened since you left home.</t3790> <t3791>Did you meet any nice gentlemen?</t3791> <t3792>Did anyone try to court you?</t3792> <t3793>I had hoped one of you would have a husband before returning.</t3793> <t3794>I can say that Jane will soon become an old maid.</t3794> <t3795>She's almost twenty-three.</t3795> <t3796>Goodness, I would be so ashamed if I didn't get married before twenty-three! Aunt Phillips really wants you to get married, you don't know that.</t3796> <t3797>She said Lizzy should have married Mr. Collins, but I think that wouldn't have been any good.</t3797> <t3798>Oh, I wish I could get married before you all, then I could accompany you to all the balls.</t3798> <t3799>Goodness! The other day we had such a fun time at Colonel Forster's house.</t3799> <t3800>Kitty and I planned to visit for a day, and Mrs. Forster promised to hold a dance in the evening, so she invited the Harrington sisters, but Harriet was sick and Pen had to go alone.</t3800> <t3801>And then, guess what we did?</t3801> <t3802>We dressed Chamberlayne in women's clothes, to disguise him as a girl – just for fun.</t3802> <t3803>No one else knew except Mr. and Mrs. Forster, Kitty and I, and the aunt, because we had to borrow her dress, you can't imagine how much he looked like a girl! When Denny, Wickham, and Pratt along with a few other guys walked in, they had no idea it was him.</t3803> <t3804>Oh my, I laughed so hard!</t3804> <t3805>So did Mrs. Forster.</t3805> <t3806>I thought I might faint.</t3806> <t3807>And that made the guys suspicious, and soon they found out the truth.</t3807>
<t3808>With the stories about the ball and such jokes, along with Kitty's embellishments, Lydia tried to entertain her sisters all the way back to Longbourn.</t3808> <t3809>Elizabeth wanted to hear as little as possible, but she could not avoid hearing Wickham's name.</t3809>
<t3810>They were warmly welcomed at home.</t3810> <t3811>Mrs. Bennet was delighted to see that Jane was still as beautiful as before.</t3811> <t3812>More than once during dinner, Mr. Bennet said to Elizabeth:</t3812>
<t3813>- Dad is happy to see you back, Lizzy.</t3813>
<t3814>The gathering in the dining room had many people, as most of the Lucas household came to meet Maria and hear her news, asking about everything.</t3814> <t3815>Lady Lucas asked Maria about her health and the chickens of her eldest daughter.</t3815> <t3816>Mrs. Bennet was doubly busy, on one hand asking Jane about the current fashion, and on the other talking to the Lucas sister.</t3816> <t3817>Lydia, with a voice that drowned out everyone else, recounted her morning amusements to anyone who would listen.</t3817>
<t3818>- Hey! Maria, I wish you were with us, it was so much fun! On the way, Kitty and I pulled down all the curtains, pretending there was no one on the bus.</t3818> <t3819>I could go the whole way like that, but Kitty felt uncomfortable.</t3819> <t3820>When we got to George, I think we behaved well, because we treated your dad to the best ham in the world; if you leave and come back, we will treat you the same way.</t3820> <t3821>And it was really fun when everyone was on the bus.</t3821> <t3822>I thought all of us sisters couldn't fit on the bus.</t3822> <t3823>I laughed so hard I almost died.</t3823> <t3824>And then all of us sisters were happy on the way back.</t3824> <t3825>We talked so loudly that everyone could hear us from ten miles away!</t3825>
<t3826>Mary replied, solemnly:</t3826>
<t3827>- She does not underestimate such pleasures, which are clearly in line with the temperament of women.</t3827> <t3828>But to be honest, she does not crave these pleasures.</t3828> <t3829>She definitely prefers reading books.</t3829>
<t3830>But Lydia did not want to hear a word of the reply.</t3830> <t3831>She rarely listened to anyone for more than half a minute, and never wanted to hear Mary.</t3831>
<t3832>In the afternoon, Lydia eagerly joined the other girls to go to Meryton and see what everyone was doing, but Elizabeth stubbornly resisted.</t3832> <t3833>It should not be said that the Bennet girls could not stay at home for half a day without chasing after the officers.</t3833> <t3834>She resisted for another reason.</t3834> <t3835>She was fed up with seeing Wickham again and was determined to avoid this for as long as possible.</t3835> <t3836>The consolation for her, that the regiment would be moving, was truly hard to describe.</t3836> <t3837>They would depart in two weeks, and after they were gone, she hoped there would be nothing left to trouble her about him.</t3837>
<t3838>Just a few hours after arriving home, she realized that her parents often discussed the plan about Brington that Lydia had mentioned at the inn.</t3838> <t3839>Elizabeth immediately saw that her father did not want to comply, but his answers were both vague and ambiguous; while her mother was not worried about failure, even though she often felt discouraged.</t3839>
<t3840>Chapter 40</t3840>
<t3841>Jane no longer wanted to satisfy Elizabeth's eagerness to know about what had happened.</t3841> <t3842>Eventually, Elizabeth did not mention her sister's situation.</t3842> <t3843>The next morning, she wanted to surprise her sister; she recounted what had happened between Mr. Darcy and herself.</t3843>
<t3844>Miss Bennet's surprise did not last long due to the sisterly affection that made her admire her sister's natural composure, then she sank into other thoughts.</t3844> <t3845>She regretted that Mr. Darcy had proposed in an inappropriate manner, but she was even more saddened by his misfortune of being rejected by her sister.</t3845> <t3846>She said:</t3846>
<t3847>- He made a mistake by being too confident that he would succeed, he shouldn't have expressed it in that way, but I think this only makes him more disappointed.</t3847>
<t3848>Elizabeth replied:</t3848>
<t3849>- That's right, I pity him, but you have other thoughts that might dispel your feelings for me.</t3849> <t3850>However, you don't blame me for rejecting him, do you?</t3850>
<t3851>- Blame you? Oh, no.</t3851>
<t3852>- But you blame me for speaking so warmly about Wickham.</t3852>
<t3853>- No. Based on what you told me about your reaction, I don't think you were wrong.</t3853>
<t3854>- But you will think, after I tell you about the next day.</t3854>
<t3855>Then she recounted the letter, repeating even the part about George Wickham.</t3855> <t3856>It was indeed a shock for poor Jane! She was always willing to endure all the ups and downs of life without believing that all the malice of humanity could be gathered in one individual.</t3856> <t3857>Even Darcy's explanation could not console her for this discovery, though her mind was somewhat eased.</t3857> <t3858>She was eager to prove the possibility of a mistake and wanted to exonerate one person without affecting another.</t3858>
<t3859>Elizabeth said:</t3859>
<t3860>- It can't be done.</t3860> <t3861>You can never make both people good at anything.</t3861> <t3862>You should choose, but you should be content with just one person.</t3862> <t3863>There is only one value between them that is enough to help one person become good, and recently, this value has been transferred back and forth quite a lot.</t3863> <t3864>As for me, I can trust Mr. Darcy completely, but it's up to you to decide.</t3864>
<t3865>However, it took Jane a while before she could muster a smile.</t3865> <t3866>She said:</t3866>
<t3867>- I have never been so shocked like this.</t3867> <t3868>Wickham is really terrible!</t3868> <t3869>It's almost unbelievable.</t3869> <t3870>Poor Mr. Darcy! Lizzy, just thinking about how much he has suffered.</t3870> <t3871>It must be so disappointing for him to know that you thought badly of him! To have to recount the story of his sister like that! It’s truly painful! I am sure you feel the same way.</t3871>
<t3872>- Oh, no!</t3872> <t3873>When I see you carrying heavy regret and pity, I no longer feel regret and pity.</t3873> <t3874>I know you will judge him fairly, so I worry less.</t3874> <t3875>Your heavy heart makes mine lighter.</t3875> <t3876>If you lament for him more, my heart will be as light as a feather.</t3876>
<t3877>- Poor Wickham! His face shows a kind expression.</t3877> <t3878>His gestures are all open and graceful.</t3878>
<t3879>- There is certainly some trouble in the educational foundation of you two.</t3879> <t3880>One person absorbs all the good things; the other only shows all the good things on the surface.</t3880>
<t3881>- I never thought Mr. Darcy was as lacking in appearance as you often think.</t3881>
<t3882>- And yet, previously you had determined to appear extraordinarily wise by hating me without any reason at all.</t3882> <t3883>This is the natural instinct of a human being, the act of opening a keen mind to have such hatred in this way.</t3883> <t3884>People can continue to insult without bothering to say anything fair, but they cannot keep mocking someone without occasionally touching on something witty.</t3884>
<t3885>- Lizzy, I'm sure that when you first read the letter, you didn't think about the matter as you do now.</t3885>
<t3886>- Actually, at that time, I couldn't think about anything.</t3886> <t3887>I was too disturbed.</t3887> <t3888>I was very disturbed, you could say I was miserable.</t3888> <t3889>And there was no one to talk to about what I was thinking, no Jane to comfort me and tell me that I had never been so weak, empty, and unreasonable! Oh! I needed you so much!</t3889>
<t3890>- It is truly regrettable that you used such strong expressions when speaking to Mr. Darcy about Wickham, as neither of them is entirely deserving of such praise or criticism.</t3890>
<t3891>- Certainly so.</t3891> <t3892>But the bitter way of speaking is the most inevitable consequence of the prejudices you keep pursuing.</t3892> <t3893>There is one thing I need your advice on.</t3893> <t3894>I want you to tell me whether or not I should inform the people we know so that they understand Wickham's true nature.</t3894>
<t3895>Ms. Bennet hesitated for a moment, then replied:</t3895>
<t3896>- There's certainly no chance to expose him in such a terrible way.</t3896> <t3897>What do you think?</t3897>
<t3898>- I think you shouldn't.</t3898> <t3899>Mr. Darcy hasn't given me permission to tell the world about what he said.</t3899> <t3900>Moreover, all details concerning his sister need to be kept confidential.</t3900> <t3901>If I try to tell everyone about other matters, who will believe me?</t3901> <t3902>The prejudices against Mr. Darcy are so intense that if he were portrayed in a good light, half the people in Meryton would faint.</t3902> <t3903>Wickham will soon leave, so no one will care to know what kind of person he really is.</t3903> <t3904>After some time, people will find out, and then we can mock them for being ignorant and not recognizing it earlier.</t3904> <t3905>Right now, I don't want to say anything about this matter.</t3905>
<t3906>- I think you're absolutely right.</t3906> <t3907>If we expose all his mistakes, we could ruin his entire life.</t3907> <t3908>Maybe now he's regretting what he did and wants to rebuild himself.</t3908> <t3909>We shouldn't make him lose hope.</t3909>
<t3910>Elizabeth's troubled mind returned to peace thanks to this conversation.</t3910> <t3911>She had confided two deep secrets that had weighed heavily on her mind for the past two weeks, certain that Jane would be willing to listen, even if she might not want to discuss the matter again.</t3911> <t3912>But there was still something lingering in the background that her cautious nature prevented her from revealing.</t3912> <t3913>She did not dare to mention the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor did she dare to explain how honestly his friend had judged her sister.</t3913> <t3914>This was a sentiment that no one could share; she realized that only perfect empathy between the two sides could dispel this mysterious burden.</t3914> <t3915>She told herself, "And then, if this unlikely situation were to actually occur, I would just have to say that Bingley could have spoken in a gentler manner.</t3915> <t3916>I cannot divulge everything until the moment of revelation has lost all significance!”</t3916>
<t3917>Now she had time to observe the true state of her sister's spirit.</t3917> <t3918>Jane was not happy.</t3918> <t3919>Her sister still harbored very tender feelings for Mr. Bingley.</t3919> <t3920>Previously, she had never thought that she knew love, but her mind was now filled with the warmth of first love.</t3920> <t3921>Due to her age and status, she was calmer than in other first loves.</t3921> <t3922>She cherished and respected her memories of him and leaned towards him more than anyone else, to the extent that all her good sense and all her care for the feelings of her loved ones were necessary to prevent her from indulging in regrets that were not beneficial to her health and peace of mind.</t3922>
<t3923>One day, Mrs. Bennet asked:</t3923>
<t3924>- So, Lizzy, what do you now think about Jane's miserable situation?</t3924> <t3925>As for me, I have decided never to speak of this matter to anyone again.</t3925> <t3926>I told your Aunt Phillips so the other day.</t3926> <t3927>But I cannot know if Jane has met him at all in London.</t3927> <t3928>He is a young man of no worth at all.</t3928> <t3929>And I think there is now no chance for Jane to marry him.</t3929> <t3930>No one has mentioned anything about him returning to Netherfield this summer; I have also inquired from everyone who might know about him.</t3930>
<t3931>- I don't think he will live at Netherfield anymore.</t3931>
<t3932>- Oh, is that so!</t3932> <t3933>It's up to him to decide.</t3933> <t3934>No one wants him to come back.</t3934> <t3935>Although mother always says that he treated her daughter badly, if she were Jane, she wouldn't have to endure it.</t3935> <t3936>Mother finds comfort in believing that if Jane were to die of heartbreak, he would regret what he had done.</t3936>
<t3937>But since Elizabeth did not feel comforted by such a prospect, she did not reply.</t3937> <t3938>The mother continued:</t3938>
<t3939>- Hey, Lizzy, and then the Collins family lives very comfortably, right?</t3939> <t3940>Alright, alright, I just hope the couple continues to be like that.</t3940> <t3941>And how is their dining table?</t3941> <t3942>I'm sure Charlotte is an excellent housekeeper.</t3942> <t3943>If she is only half as thrifty as her mother, she could save enough money.</t3943> <t3944>I'm sure there is nothing wasteful in the management of their household.</t3944>
<t3945>- No, no waste at all.</t3945>
<t3946>- Management must be very skillful.</t3946> <t3947>Yes, that's right.</t3947> <t3948>They will be careful not to spend more than their income.</t3948> <t3949>They will never be short of money.</t3949> <t3950>Ah, so many good things for them! And so, I guess the two often talk about taking over Longbourn when your father passes away.</t3950> <t3951>I'm sure they consider it theirs once that happens.</t3951>
<t3952>- They don't talk about this in front of the child.</t3952>
<t3953>- That's right.</t3953> <t3954>If they say so, it is indeed strange.</t3954> <t3955>But I no longer have any doubts.</t3955> <t3956>They often talk about that with each other.</t3956> <t3957>Well, if they can feel comfortable with a property that is not legally theirs, then that's fine.</t3957> <t3958>I would be ashamed to have a property that I only inherited by order.</t3958>
<t3959>Chapter 41</t3959>
<t3960>They have been back home for two weeks.</t3960> <t3961>This is the last week the regiment will stay in Meryton.</t3961> <t3962>All the young girls were downcast; all were disheartened.</t3962> <t3963>Only the two eldest Bennet daughters could eat, sleep, and continue their daily routines.</t3963> <t3964>Very often, Kitty and Lydia reproached them for their indifferent attitude.</t3964> <t3965>The two younger girls felt too miserable to understand such stony-heartedness within the family.</t3965> <t3966>They often bitterly exclaimed:</t3966>
<t3967>- Good heavens! What will become of us?</t3967> <t3968>What will we do? How can you still smile like that, Lizzy?</t3968>
<t3969>The loving mother shared their pain.</t3969> <t3970>She remembered that she had gone through a similar situation twenty years ago.</t3970> <t3971>She said:</t3971>
<t3972>- I'm sure I will cry for two days with you when Colonel Millar's regiment leaves.</t3972> <t3973>I think my heart might break.</t3973>
<t3974>- I am sure my heart will be broken.</t3974>
<t3975>She remarked:</t3975>
<t3976>- I just wish I could go to Brington!</t3976>
<t3977>- Ah, really, I wish I could go to Brington! But papa is too difficult!</t3977>
<t3978>- Swimming in the sea a little is enough for you forever.</t3978>
<t3979>Kitty added:</t3979>
<t3980>- And Aunt Phillips will certainly be able to help you a lot.</t3980>
<t3981>This is the kind of lamentation that always echoes in the Longbourn house.</t3981> <t3982>Elizabeth tried to make this a diversion, but all feelings of joy vanished in shame.</t3982> <t3983>Once again, she felt that Mr. Darcy's opposition was justified, and never before had she felt such a desire to forgive his interference in his friend's views.</t3983>
<t3984>But the gloom in Lydia's prospects was dispelled, for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the Colonel in the regiment, to accompany her to Brington.</t3984> <t3985>This dear friend was a very young woman, and had only recently been married.</t3985> <t3986>A similar sense of humor and high spirits had brought the two women together, and in three months of acquaintance, they had become close in two months.</t3986>
<t3987>Lydia's delight, her affection for Mrs. Forster, Mrs. Bennet's cheerfulness, and Kitty's humiliation were all difficult to describe.</t3987> <t3988>Completely oblivious to her sister's feelings, Lydia wandered around the house in a state of ecstatic restlessness, calling on everyone to congratulate her, chattering away, while the unfortunate Kitty expressed her irritation in nonsensical words.</t3988> <t3989>She said to her sisters:</t3989>
<t3990>- I can't understand why Mrs. Forster invited Lydia and not me.</t3990> <t3991>Even though I'm not a special friend of hers, I still have the right to be invited just as much as she does.</t3991> <t3992>Even more so, because I am two years older than she is.</t3992>
<t3993>Elizabeth could not make her understand more, and Jane could not make her resign.</t3993> <t3994>As for Elizabeth, this invitation did not excite her as much as it did her mother and Lydia, to the extent that she saw it as a death sentence for any possibility of Lydia having a conscience.</t3994> <t3995>She made a decision that might be despised if not kept secret; she could not help but advise her father not to let Lydia go.</t3995> <t3996>She presented to him all of Lydia's improper behavior, the unbeneficial relationship with Mrs. Forster, the possibility that Lydia would become even more reckless with such a companion at Brington, where the temptations might be stronger than near home.</t3996> <t3997>He listened to her attentively, then said:</t3997>
<t3998>- Lydia will never be at peace until she can socialize in public or somewhere else.</t3998> <t3999>And we can never expect her to socialize in such a way with less expense or trouble for the family under the current circumstances.</t3999>
<t4000>Elizabeth said:</t4000>
<t4001>- If father knew about the severe disadvantages for all of us when people notice Lydia's lack of tact and recklessness, which they already have, I think he would consider the matter differently.</t4001>
<t4002>- Noticed?!</t4002> <t4003>What, has she already driven away a few of your suitors? Poor Lizzy! But don't be discouraged.</t4003> <t4004>Any young people who are so restless that they can't bear to engage with a bit of absurdity aren't worth our regret.</t4004> <t4005>Come here, let me see the list of those poor boys who have been kept away by that crazy Lydia.</t4005>
<t4006>- Actually, father was mistaken.</t4006> <t4007>I don't feel hurt or upset.</t4007> <t4008>I am complaining about bad habits in general, not any specific bad habit.</t4008> <t4009>The status of our family and the respect others have for us will certainly be affected by the impulsiveness, decisiveness, and disregard for all restraint, which are Lydia's characteristics.</t4009> <t4010>Sorry, father, for speaking frankly.</t4010> <t4011>Dear father, if you do not take the trouble to control her exuberant temperament and if you do not teach her that she should not make her current pursuits of pleasure her daily life's work, she will soon be beyond correction.</t4011> <t4012>Her character will become fixed; then at sixteen, she will become so wanton that she herself and the whole family will be a laughingstock.</t4012> <t4013>A girl who indulges in the worst and most base kind of wantonness, with nothing to attract people except youth, and a person barely tolerable.</t4013> <t4014>With a foolish and empty mind, she cannot withstand contempt while she herself desires to be admired.</t4014> <t4015>In this danger, Kitty is also a concern.</t4015> <t4016>She will imitate all of Lydia's bad habits.</t4016> <t4017>Oh, father, can you think that they will not be criticized and despised everywhere they are known, and that their sisters will not be humiliated by association?</t4017>
<t4018>Mr. Bennet saw that she was deeply invested in the matter, and affectionately took her hand, he said:</t4018>
<t4019>- Don't let yourself be anxious, my dear.</t4019> <t4020>Everywhere people know you and Jane, you both will be respected and appreciated, and you won't seem disadvantaged if you have two – or three – foolish siblings.</t4020> <t4021>We won't be able to have peace at Longbourn if Lydia doesn't go to Brington.</t4021> <t4022>Let her go. Colonel Forster is a sensible person and will help her avoid all sorts of trouble, and fortunately, she is too poor to be prey for anyone.</t4022> <t4023>In Brington, she will become less playful than she is here.</t4023> <t4024>The officers there will find women more worthy of their attention.</t4024> <t4025>Therefore, we should believe that the girl will learn a lesson about her own insignificance.</t4025> <t4026>Anyway, she can't become any worse, unless she wants me to confine her to the house for the rest of her life.</t4026>
<t4027>With this answer, Elizabeth was forced to be satisfied, but she still held onto her opinion in disappointment and frustration.</t4027> <t4028>However, she did not have the temperament to remain upset forever over the matter.</t4028> <t4029>She was content that she had fulfilled her duty, and did not have the tendency to stay upset over unpleasant matters, which were inevitable, and thus cause herself more worry.</t4029>
<t4030>If Lydia and her mother knew about the conversation she had with her father, their outrage would be difficult to put into words given their quick tempers.</t4030> <t4031>In Lydia's imagination, a trip to Brington encompassed every possibility of earthly happiness.</t4031> <t4032>With a fanciful eye, she envisioned streets crowded with officers, and herself as the object of attention for dozens of strange young men.</t4032> <t4033>She saw all the glory of the barracks; the rows of tents neatly lined up, bustling with young and lively men in bright red; and to complete the scene, she even saw herself sitting under a tent, playfully flirting with at least six officers at once.</t4033>
<t4034>If you knew that your sister had tried to pull you out of such visions and realities, what would you think?</t4034> <t4035>Only your mother could understand these thoughts, because she had the same feelings.</t4035> <t4036>Lydia going to Brington was the only comfort for her melancholy, as her husband never intended to go there.</t4036>
<t4037>But they knew nothing about what had happened, remaining eager until the day of departure.</t4037>
<t4038>Elizabeth is now preparing to meet Mr. Wickham for the last time.</t4038> <t4039>Since her return, she had met him frequently, and the agitation in her mind had greatly diminished; the agitation from her initial feelings had completely disappeared.</t4039> <t4040>She had realized that, in the same gentle demeanor that had once delighted her, there was now a sense of absurdity and something akin to disgust and weariness.</t4040> <t4041>Moreover, in his current manner towards her, she had additional reasons for dissatisfaction because he seemed to want to rekindle their old feelings as if nothing had happened, which only made her more infuriated after all that had transpired.</t4041> <t4042>She lost all interest in him when she saw herself being chosen as an object for such pointless and frivolous flirtation.</t4042> <t4043>While she rebuffed him, she had the impression that he was still confident that no matter how long he had neglected her and for whatever reason, he could satisfy her vanity and could win her back at any time.</t4043>
<t4044>On the last day of the Meryton regiment, he attended a dinner with other officers at Longbourn.</t4044> <t4045>Elizabeth was not at all prepared to bid him farewell cheerfully, so much so that when he asked about her stay in Hentsford, she mentioned that both Colonel Fitzwilliam and Mr. Darcy would be staying at Rosings for three weeks, and asked if he was acquainted with the colonel.</t4045>
<t4046>He showed a look of surprise, dissatisfaction, and worry, but quickly calmed himself, and with a smile, replied that he often met the Colonel; and after noting that he was a refined person, he asked her what she thought of him.</t4046> <t4047>Her answer warmed his heart.</t4047> <t4048>With a cold demeanor, he then asked:</t4048>
<t4049>- How long did she tell him to stay at Rosings?</t4049>
<t4050>- Nearly three weeks.</t4050>
<t4051>- And do you meet him often?</t4051>
<t4052>- Yes, almost every day.</t4052>
<t4053>- His character is completely different from his cousin's.</t4053>
<t4054>- Yes, very different.</t4054> <t4055>But I think Mr. Darcy has learned to communicate better.</t4055>
<t4056>Wickham exclaimed with an expression that did not escape her observation:</t4056>
<t4057>- Really?</t4057>
<t4058>But he calmed down and added:</t4058>
<t4059>- May I ask, does he communicate better through spoken words?</t4059> <t4060>Or does he just want to add more politeness to his usual manner?</t4060>
<t4061>He continued in a lower and more solemn tone:</t4061>
<t4062>- Because I do not dare to hope that he has changed his essential nature.</t4062>
<t4063>Elizabeth said:</t4063>
<t4064>- Ah, no.</t4064> <t4065>I believe that in his essential qualities, he is still much the same as before.</t4065>
<t4066>While she spoke, Wickham seemed unsure whether to be pleased by her words or to distrust their meaning.</t4066> <t4067>There was something in her expression that made him listen with anxious attention as she continued:</t4067>
<t4068>- When I said he communicated better, I didn't mean that his speech or gestures had improved.</t4068> <t4069>I just meant that, if we knew more about him, we could understand him better.</t4069>
<t4070>The worried look on Wickham's face now seemed to have added confusion.</t4070> <t4071>For a few minutes, he remained silent until he shook off all confusion, then turned back to her and spoke very gently:</t4071>
<t4072>- Since you have understood very well my feelings about Mr. Darcy, you must understand how sincerely happy I was when he was wise enough to create a proper appearance.</t4072> <t4073>In this way, his pride will be beneficial if not to him then to others, as it will prevent him from committing the vile acts that caused me so much misery.</t4073> <t4074>I only fear that he adopts a cautious attitude, which I guess you have observed, only when he visits his aunt, whose opinions and judgments he greatly respects.</t4074> <t4075>I know he is always afraid of her when they are together, largely because of his intention to marry Miss De Bourgh, whom I am sure he is very fond of.</t4075>
<t4076>Elizabeth couldn't suppress a smile when she heard this, but she only responded with a slight nod.</t4076> <t4077>She sensed that he wanted to bring her back to the old topic of his complaints, but she no longer had the inclination to follow his lead.</t4077> <t4078>Throughout the rest of the evening, outwardly he tried to maintain his usual cheerful demeanor, but he no longer wanted to pay attention to her amidst the crowd.</t4078> <t4079>Finally, the two politely parted ways, perhaps both wishing never to see each other again.</t4079>
<t4080>When everyone had left, Lydia went with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from where they would set off the next morning.</t4080>
<t4081>The farewell between her and the family was more noisy than touching.</t4081> <t4082>Only Kitty shed tears, but it was out of displeasure and jealousy.</t4082> <t4083>Mrs. Bennet was lengthy in her blessings for her fortunate daughter, impressing upon her through her instructions that she should not miss any opportunity to enjoy herself as much as possible.</t4083> <t4084>In the noisy delight, Lydia bid farewell, unable to hear the gentle goodbyes of her sisters.</t4084>
<t4085>Chapter 42</t4085>
<t4086>If Elizabeth's thoughts were all derived from her family, she could not have formed a very favorable impression of married life or a harmonious family.</t4086> <t4087>Her father, attracted by youth, beauty, and the outward cheerfulness that youth and beauty bring, had married a woman of weak understanding and narrow mind, and from the very beginning of the marriage, he had lost all real affection for her.</t4087> <t4088>Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished forever; all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown.</t4088> <t4089>But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for his disappointment in his own imprudence, so he did not resort to those pleasures which might have soothed the unfortunate who had acted foolishly or wickedly.</t4089> <t4090>He loved the countryside and books, and found enjoyment in them.</t4090> <t4091>As for his wife, he owed her little gratitude except for the amusement her folly and nonsense provided him.</t4091> <t4092>This was not the sort of happiness that makes a man grateful to his wife, but when he had no ability to indulge in other diversions, the true philosopher must derive benefit from whatever is available.</t4092>
<t4093>However, Elizabeth had never ignored his improper behaviors as a husband.</t4093> <t4094>She was always distressed to see him like that, but out of respect for his abilities and happiness at being cherished by him, she tried to forget what she could not overlook and pushed out of her mind the sad actions when he showed irresponsibility or lacked the spirit of marital decorum by exposing his wife to the contempt of their children.</t4094> <t4095>But she had never deeply felt the disadvantages for the daughters in such a discordant marriage, nor had she ever recognized the harms of misusing talents – talents that, if properly harnessed, could at least earn the daughters respect from others, if not broaden the mind of their mother.</t4095>
<t4096>While Elizabeth was glad that Wickham would be leaving, she saw no other reason to be satisfied with the loss of the militia regiment.</t4096> <t4097>Social gatherings at other people's houses became more monotonous than before; and at home, she had a mother and a sister who were always irritable because everything around them had become boring, creating a gloomy atmosphere in the family.</t4097> <t4098>Although Kitty gradually regained her natural sense because those who disturbed her mind were absent, the other sister, whom everyone feared would encounter worse, might plunge deeper into her foolish self-confidence.</t4098> <t4099>Thus, as before, she thought that an event she eagerly awaited, when it happened, did not satisfy her as she had hoped.</t4099> <t4100>As a result, it was necessary to identify another time period to truly begin to be happy.</t4100> <t4101>There needed to be a milestone to which all wishes and hopes could be connected.</t4101> <t4102>Through this, feeling pleasure in anticipation, comforting her for the present, and preparing for another disappointment.</t4102> <t4103>Her trip to the Lake District had now become a happy thought.</t4103> <t4104>This was the best consolation for the frustrating moments caused by her mother and Kitty.</t4104> <t4105>If Jane could join in this plan, everything would become wonderful.</t4105>
<t4106>She thought: "It's fortunate that I still have something to wish for.</t4106> <t4107>If everything had been arranged perfectly, I would surely be disappointed.</t4107> <t4108>But here, by harboring an endless source of regret while my sister is absent, I can hope that all my wishes will come true.</t4108> <t4109>A plan in which everything promises to bring joy never succeeds; one can only avoid disappointment by making excuses for a few peculiar inconveniences."</t4109>
<t4110>When Lydia left, she promised to write letters regularly and in great detail to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always delayed and always very short.</t4110> <t4111>The letters to her mother said little more than that they had just returned from the library with some officers who were doting on them, about the shops where they saw jewelry that captivated them; that she had just bought a new maxi dress, or a new umbrella that she should have described in detail, but had to hastily end because Mrs. Forster was calling, and they were preparing to go to the barracks.</t4111> <t4112>Communication with her sister provided even less news, the letters to Kitty, though longer, contained too many things that could not be shared with others.</t4112>
<t4113>After Lydia had been gone for two or three weeks, a cheerful atmosphere returned to Longbourn.</t4113> <t4114>Everything brought a more uplifting spirit.</t4114> <t4115>Families who had gone to the city during the winter returned, and springtime interactions began again.</t4115> <t4116>Mrs. Bennet reverted to her usual quiet grumbling.</t4116> <t4117>By mid-June, Kitty had calmed down enough to go to Meryton without shedding tears; an event promising much good, leading Elizabeth to hope that by the next Christmas season, her younger sister might become sensible enough not to mention an officer more than once a day, unless, through the malicious arrangements of the defense department, another regiment was stationed in Meryton.</t4117>
<t4118>The time to start the Northern excursion is approaching quickly.</t4118> <t4119>With only two weeks left, a letter from Mrs. Gardiner arrives, causing the trip to be postponed and the journey to be shortened.</t4119> <t4120>Mrs. Gardiner is busy with work until July and has to go to London for a month.</t4120> <t4121>The time is not sufficient for them to travel far to see much, or at least to see leisurely and comfortably as planned.</t4121> <t4122>They are forced to cancel the trip to the Lake District, replacing it with a closer itinerary.</t4122> <t4123>According to the new plan, they will only go as far as Derbyshire.</t4123> <t4124>This region has enough variety for them to explore over three weeks and is particularly appealing to Mrs. Gardiner. The town where she lived for a few years before, and where they plan to stay for a few days, is of special interest to her.</t4124>
<t4125>Elizabeth was very disappointed; she had hoped to visit the Lake District and thought there might still be enough time.</t4125> <t4126>But her nature was easily contented with what she had, so she was willing to accept the new circumstances.</t4126>
<t4127>Many thoughts are evoked by the name Derbyshire.</t4127> <t4128>She could not visit the area without thinking of Pemberley estate and its owner.</t4128> <t4129>She told herself, "But surely I can enter the region where he resides with a peaceful mind and bring back some mineral crystals without his knowledge.</t4129><t4130>"</t4130>
<t4131>The waiting time has now doubled, four weeks before the uncle and aunt arrive.</t4131> <t4132>The children, including two girls aged six and eight and two younger boys, were entrusted to Jane's care.</t4132> <t4133>The children adored Jane, and with her calm and sweet nature, she proved to be suitable for taking care of them, teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</t4133>
<t4134>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner stayed at Longbourn for only one night, then set off the next day with Elizabeth to seek new and delightful experiences. Surely the three of them would find much enjoyment, as they had suitable companions; the harmony in both body and mind to endure any inconveniences, the optimism to fully appreciate every pleasure, along with the love and intelligence to cope with any disappointments when away from home.</t4134>
<t4135>No need to describe Derbyshire or the famous places along the way in detail, just focus on a small region of Derbyshire.</t4135> <t4136>When they arrived at the small town of Lambton, where Mrs. Gardiner used to reside and where she recently learned that some acquaintances still remained, they turned onto another road, and after traveling five miles, Mrs. Gardiner informed Elizabeth that they had reached Pemberley.</t4136> <t4137>It was not directly on their route, but no more than one or two miles off the road.</t4137> <t4138>On the previous evening, while discussing the next day's journey, Mrs. Gardiner had expressed a desire to visit this place again.</t4138> <t4139>Mr. Gardiner agreed, and Elizabeth was consulted.</t4139> <t4140>Mrs. Gardiner said:</t4140>
<t4141>- Child, do you want to go see the place you've heard so much about?</t4141> <t4142>The place where a few people you know are.</t4142> <t4143>Wickham lived here when he was a child, you know.</t4143>
<t4144>Elizabeth felt sorrowful.</t4144> <t4145>She thought she had nothing to do with Pemberley, wanting to appear uninterested in going there.</t4145> <t4146>She stated that she was too tired of looking at large houses; after having seen so many of them, she no longer found any pleasure in seeing beautiful carpets or satin curtains.</t4146> <t4147>Mrs. Gardiner criticized her ignorance:</t4147>
<t4148>- If there were only elaborately decorated houses, I wouldn't bother going there; but this land is truly wonderful.</t4148> <t4149>It has the most beautiful forests in the country.</t4149>
<t4150>Elizabeth said nothing more, but inwardly she did not agree.</t4150> <t4151>The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy again upon going there immediately came to her mind.</t4151> <t4152>How dreadful!</t4152> <t4153>She blushed at the thought, considering that she should speak frankly to her aunt rather than take the risk.</t4153> <t4154>But her aunt objected.</t4154> <t4155>In the end, she would decide after discreetly inquiring about the family's absence.</t4155>
<t4156>In that manner, in the evening, she asked the chambermaid whether the Pemberley estate was worth visiting, who the owner was, and she calmly inquired whether the owner had arrived to enjoy the summer yet.</t4156> <t4157>The chambermaid replied that he had not.</t4157> <t4158>Now with nothing to worry about, she was curious to see the house.</t4158> <t4159>When asked for her opinion again the next morning, she calmly replied that she actually had no objections to the couple's plan.</t4159>
<t4160>Therefore, the three people set off for Pemberley.</t4160>
<t4161>End of episode 2</t4161>
<t4162>Chapter 43</t4162>
<t4163>On the way, Elizabeth anxiously watched the Pemberley garden come into view, but as they entered the estate, her spirits lifted again.</t4163>
<t4164>The garden was really spacious and varied.</t4164> <t4165>They entered through one of the low areas, then drove a long way along a lush forest.</t4165>
<t4166>Elizabeth's mind was too busy for conversation, but she observed every scene and angle.</t4166> <t4167>They walked half a mile up a gentle slope, then reached a high ground where the woodland ended, and they immediately saw Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, with the road suddenly turning into it.</t4167> <t4168>It was a large, grand building, built of stone, standing prominently on high ground, backed by a range of hills covered with woods.</t4168> <t4169>In front was a stream that widened out but did not appear artificial; the banks were not in straight lines but did not seem overly embellished.</t4169> <t4170>Elizabeth enjoyed the view.</t4170> <t4171>She had never seen a place so favored by nature, or one where natural beauty was so little marred by coarse taste.</t4171> <t4172>All three felt a warmth in their hearts as they admired it, and at that moment she thought that being the mistress of this estate must be something indeed!</t4172>
<t4173>They went down the hillside, crossed a bridge, and drove the carriage through the gate.</t4173> <t4174>While observing the mansion up close, all her worries about meeting the owner returned to her mind.</t4174> <t4175>She feared that the butler might be mistaken.</t4175> <t4176>They asked for permission and were invited into the hall.</t4176> <t4177>While waiting for the steward, Elizabeth idly thought about her presence there.</t4177>
<t4178>The housekeeper came, a respectable-looking, elderly woman, somewhat coarse but more polite than she had thought.</t4178> <t4179>They followed her into the dining room.</t4179> <t4180>It was a spacious, well-proportioned room, decorated with elegance.</t4180> <t4181>After a brief glance around, Elizabeth walked to a window to admire the view outside.</t4181> <t4182>The hill covered by the canopy of trees where they had descended was suddenly interrupted by a steep slope, creating a magnificent landscape.</t4182> <t4183>Everything on the ground was harmoniously arranged; and she delighted in the panoramic view, the river, the scattered trees along its banks, and the winding valley stretching as far as the eye could see.</t4183> <t4184>As they passed through other rooms, these scenes shifted position, but each window revealed its own unique beauty.</t4184> <t4185>The rooms were all high and spacious, with elegant furnishings befitting the wealth of the owner; but Elizabeth admired his taste, as there was nothing gaudy or excessively meticulous; less opulent yet more refined than the furnishings in the Rosings estate.</t4185>
<t4186>She thought: "I could be the mistress of this place! Now I can start getting familiar with these rooms.</t4186> <t4187>Instead of looking at everything like a stranger, I can delight in seeing it as mine, and I can welcome my uncle and aunt as if they were two close relatives visiting."</t4187> <t4188>She calmed herself: "But no, it can never be like that; my uncle and aunt will never know what happened to me; I shouldn't invite them."</t4188>
<t4189>This is a fortunate calmness – it helps her escape from something almost like regret.</t4189>
<t4190>She very much wanted to ask the housekeeper whether the master was truly absent or not, but she did not have the courage.</t4190> <t4191>However, eventually her uncle asked, and she turned away in panic, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was away, and added: "But we are preparing to welcome him back tomorrow, with a large group of his friends."</t4191> <t4192>Elizabeth was delighted to feel that their trip had not been delayed by a day!</t4192>
<t4193>Aunt now called her to see a painting.</t4193> <t4194>She approached and saw Wickham's portrait hanging above the fireplace, among other miniatures.</t4194> <t4195>Aunt smiled and asked her what she thought.</t4195> <t4196>The housekeeper stepped forward and informed them that it was a picture of the old gentleman's adopted son, who had been supported by him, and added: "He has joined the army, but I fear he has become too wayward."</t4196>
<t4197>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her and smiled, but she could not respond.</t4197>
<t4198>Mrs. Reynolds pointed to another miniature painting and said:</t4198>
<t4199>- And here is my boss, he looks a lot like him.</t4199> <t4200>The painting was made around the same time as the other one, about eight years ago.</t4200>
<t4201>Mrs. Gardiner looked at the painting and said:</t4201>
<t4202>- I have heard much about your master's good nature; this is a beautiful portrait.</t4202> <t4203>But, Lizzy, can you tell me if the portrait resembles him in real life?</t4203>
<t4204>Mrs. Reynolds seemed to have more respect for Elizabeth upon hearing that she was acquainted with her master.</t4204>
<t4205>- Does the young lady here know Mr. Darcy</t4205><t4206>?</t4206>
<t4207>Elizabeth blushed:</t4207>
<t4208>- I know a little bit.</t4208>
<t4209>- And you must think he is a really handsome man, right?</t4209>
<t4210>- Yes, very handsome.</t4210>
<t4211>- I am sure I have never seen anyone as handsome, but in the room upstairs you will see a more beautiful painting, larger than this one.</t4211> <t4212>This room was the old man's favorite; these miniature paintings are still arranged just as they were in the old days.</t4212> <t4213>The old man was very fond of these paintings.</t4213>
<t4214>This explains to Elizabeth why Mr. Wickham's portrait is hung here.</t4214>
<t4215>Then Mrs. Reynolds pointed to a portrait of Miss Darcy, painted when she was only eight years old.</t4215> <t4216>Mrs. Gardiner asked:</t4216>
<t4217>- And Miss Darcy is as beautiful as her brother, isn't she?</t4217>
<t4218>- Ah! Yes – a young lady, beautiful beyond compare, and very talented too.</t4218> <t4219>She sings and performs all day long.</t4219> <t4220>In the next room, there is a new piano that was just delivered for her – a gift from my master; she will come here with him.</t4220>
<t4221>With very natural gestures and easily creating goodwill through a few questions and comments, Mr. Gardiner encouraged her to speak more.</t4221> <t4222>Mrs. Reynolds, out of pride or hospitality, was clearly very happy to have the opportunity to talk about her master and his sister.</t4222>
<t4223>- Does your master stay at Pemberley often throughout the year?</t4223>
<t4224>- Not as often as I would like, sir; but I can say that he is here half of the time, and Miss Darcy is always here during the summer months.</t4224>
<t4225>Elizabeth thought: "Except when she went to Ramsgate."</t4225>
<t4226>- When your husband gets married, you will surely see him more often.</t4226>
<t4227>- Yes, Sir, but I am not sure when that will happen.</t4227> <t4228>I am not sure who could be worthy of him.</t4228>
<t4229>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.</t4229> <t4230>Elizabeth couldn't help but exclaim:</t4230>
<t4231>- She must think that way because of his true worth as a person.</t4231>
<t4232>- I am only speaking the truth and what everyone knows well about him.</t4232>
<t4233>Elizabeth thought the matter was going quite far, and she listened in surprise as the housekeeper added:</t4233>
<t4234>- In my life, I have never heard him say anything harsh, and I have known him since he was four.</t4234>
<t4235>This is an unusual praise compared to other praises, completely contrary to her opinion.</t4235> <t4236>She always firmly believed that he was not a calm person.</t4236> <t4237>Her attention was further aroused, and she was delighted to hear her uncle say:</t4237>
<t4238>- Very few people are praised that much.</t4238> <t4239>She is fortunate to have such a boss.</t4239>
<t4240>- Yes, Sir, I know I am lucky.</t4240> <t4241>If I traveled around the world, I would not be able to meet anyone better than him.</t4241> <t4242>But I always see one thing: a person who has a good nature as a child will have a good nature when they grow up; and he has always been the gentlest child, with the most generous heart in the world.</t4242>
<t4243>Elizabeth almost stared at her.</t4243> <t4244>She thought: "Could Mr. Darcy really be like that!"</t4244>
<t4245>Mrs. Gardiner said:</t4245>
<t4246>- The old man is a very good person.</t4246>
<t4247>- Yes, that's right, ma'am; and his son will be like him – also kind to the poor.</t4247>
<t4248>Elizabeth listened, wondering, doubting, eager to hear more.</t4248> <t4249>Mrs. Reynolds could not get her to pay attention to anything else.</t4249> <t4250>She talked about the paintings, the size of the rooms, the cost of the furnishings, but Elizabeth did not pay attention.</t4250> <t4251>Mr. Gardiner was very amused by the prejudiced attitude stemming from family affection, which he thought was the reason for the enthusiastic praises.</t4251> <t4252>He drew her back to the old topic, and she eagerly spoke about the virtues of her master as they walked up the stairs together.</t4252> <t4253>She said:</t4253>
<t4254>- He is the best landlord and the best householder, unlike the young men these days who only think of themselves and don't care about anyone else.</t4254> <t4255>There isn't a tenant or servant who doesn't speak well of him.</t4255> <t4256>Some people say he is proud, but I have never seen that.</t4256> <t4257>I think it's just because he doesn't boast like the young men.</t4257>
<t4258>Elizabeth thought, "How endearing this makes him!"</t4258>
<t4259>The aunt whispered, as they walked together:</t4259>
<t4260>- Such words of praise about his virtues are not consistent with your attitude towards our poor friend.</t4260>
<t4261>- Maybe we have been deceived.</t4261>
<t4262>- It's hard to be like that; our source is very reliable.</t4262>
<t4263>As they walked up the hallway on the upper floor, they were led into a reception room, which was decorated more elegantly and gracefully than the rooms below.</t4263> <t4264>The housekeeper introduced it as a room that had just been completed specifically for Miss Darcy, as she had taken a liking to it during her last stay here.</t4264>
<t4265>Elizabeth said, as she walked to a window:</t4265>
<t4266>- He is definitely a good brother.</t4266>
<t4267>Mrs. Reynolds thinks Miss Darcy will like this room when she arrives here.</t4267> <t4268>She added:</t4268>
<t4269>- He has always been like that.</t4269> <t4270>Anything that can make her happy can be done immediately.</t4270> <t4271>If it's for her, there's nothing he would refuse.</t4271>
<t4272>They were taken to see the gallery and a few of the main bedrooms.</t4272> <t4273>The gallery had beautiful paintings, but Elizabeth knew nothing about art; and from what she had seen downstairs, she wanted to see the portraits of Miss Darcy, drawn in pastels, which were subjects she found more interesting and easier to understand.</t4273>
<t4274>The gallery had many family portraits, but nothing that drew the attention of visitors.</t4274> <t4275>Elizabeth walked around searching for the one face she knew.</t4275> <t4276>Finally, she stopped in front of Mr. Darcy's portrait, with a smile on his face that she remembered seeing a few times when he looked at her.</t4276> <t4277>She stood for a few minutes before the portrait, gazing intently, and looked back once more before they left the gallery.</t4277> <t4278>Mrs. Reynolds mentioned that the painting was done during the old master's lifetime.</t4278>
<t4279>At this moment, a gentle feeling seeped into Elizabeth's consciousness, gentler than her thoughts when they were at their best with each other.</t4279> <t4280>Mrs. Reynolds's praise was not a trivial matter.</t4280> <t4281>What praise could be more valuable than that of an intelligent servant?</t4281> <t4282>She thought of how many people were made happy under his protection, as a brother, a landlord, a master of the house!</t4282> <t4283>How much joy or sorrow he had the power to bestow!</t4283> <t4284>How many good or bad things he could do!</t4284> <t4285>Every opinion the housekeeper expressed spoke well of his character, and as she stood before his portrait, with him gazing intently at her, she thought of his feelings with the deepest gratitude she had ever felt; she recalled the warmth of these feelings, realizing that his way of expressing them was not as improper as she had previously thought.</t4285>
<t4286>After having toured all the places they were allowed to visit, the three of them went back downstairs, bid farewell to the housekeeper, and were introduced to the gardener who had come to the foyer to meet them.</t4286>
<t4287>As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth looked back; her uncle and aunt also stopped, and while they were speculating about the time the mansion was built, its owner suddenly came up from the path leading to the stables.</t4287>
<t4288>They stood about twenty yards apart, his appearance was so sudden that she couldn't avoid him.</t4288> <t4289>Their eyes met, and both of their cheeks flushed.</t4289> <t4290>He was extremely surprised, for a moment seemingly motionless with astonishment.</t4290> <t4291>But he quickly regained his composure, stepped forward and greeted Elizabeth with words that were not entirely calm, but at least very polite.</t4291>
<t4292>She instinctively turned her face away, but stopped when he approached, accepting his greeting with an uncontainable confusion.</t4292> <t4293>If his appearance or the portrait of him they had just seen were not enough for her uncle and aunt to recognize him, the gardener's surprise upon seeing the master of the house immediately said it all.</t4293> <t4294>The uncle and aunt stood a little distance away as he spoke with their niece, while she was too stunned and awkward to look directly at him, not knowing how to respond when he politely inquired about her family's health.</t4294> <t4295>She was also surprised by his changed demeanor compared to the last time they met, which only added to her confusion with every word he uttered.</t4295> <t4296>All thoughts about her sudden visit returned to her mind; and the few minutes they continued to converse were the most uncomfortable moments of her life.</t4296> <t4297>He did not seem natural either.</t4297> <t4298>When he spoke, his tone lacked its usual calmness; and he repeated questions about when they had left Longbourn and about her stay in Derbyshire, stammering, clearly showing he was distracted.</t4298>
<t4299>In the end, he couldn't focus on any idea; and, after standing there for a moment speechless, he suddenly calmed down, then took his leave of them.</t4299>
<t4300>Her uncle and aunt went on to praise his appearance; but Elizabeth did not hear a word.</t4300> <t4301>Completely absorbed in her own thoughts, she walked on with the couple.</t4301> <t4302>Shame and vexation filled her heart.</t4302> <t4303>Her coming here was truly unfortunate, the most ill-considered act of her life! How strange he must find it! A vain man like him would see her as humiliated!</t4303> <t4304>It seemed as if once again she had deliberately brought herself right in front of him! Oh! Why did she come here?</t4304> <t4305>And why did he return a day early?</t4305> <t4306>If the three of them had left ten minutes earlier, they could have avoided him, for it was evident that at that moment he was arriving, either dismounting from his horse or stepping out of his carriage.</t4306> <t4307>She blushed and blushed again over the wretched encounter.</t4307> <t4308>And his demeanor, completely changed, what did it mean? That he still wanted to converse with her was surprising enough, but to speak with such politeness, and even inquire about her family! Never had she seen his manner so unpretentious, never had he spoken so gently as in this unexpected meeting.</t4308> <t4309>It was indeed a stark contrast to his behavior at Rosings, when he handed her his letter.</t4309> <t4310>She did not know what to think or how to interpret it.</t4310>
<t4311>They had walked onto the path along the riverbank, each step bringing a more elegant scene or a more beautiful stretch of forest; but only after a while did Elizabeth realize this.</t4311> <t4312>Although she mechanically responded to every comment from her uncle and aunt and tried to direct her gaze to where they pointed, she could not distinguish the scenes around her.</t4312> <t4313>All her thoughts were directed to a place within the Pemberley estate, any place where Mr. Darcy might be present.</t4313> <t4314>She wanted to know what he was thinking at that moment, and whether she still held any affection in his mind, even though she still felt defiant.</t4314> <t4315>Perhaps he had been polite to her just because he felt comfortable, yet there was something in his voice that showed her he was not calm.</t4315> <t4316>She could not guess whether he was distressed or pleased to see her again, but surely he had not maintained his composure when he saw her.</t4316>
<t4317>However, in the end, her uncle and aunt's remarks about her absent-mindedness awakened her mind, and she thought she needed to return to herself.</t4317>
<t4318>They entered the forest and bid farewell to the river, climbing up a slope to a place where the sparse canopy opened up to reveal a mesmerizing view of the valley, with hills facing a long stretch of tree-covered land, and glimpses of the water appearing intermittently.</t4318><t4319>The uncle expressed a desire to walk around the entire garden, but was concerned about the long distance.</t4319><t4320>The gardener proudly informed them that the path was ten miles long.</t4320><t4321>So he dismissed the idea, and they followed the familiar path, and after descending under the drooping foliage, they reencountered the riverbank where the water was at its narrowest.</t4321><t4322>They crossed a rustic bridge that blended harmoniously with the surrounding scenery.</t4322><t4323>This was the least maintained area compared to the places they had passed through.</t4323><t4324>The valley here narrowed, leaving just enough space for the river to flow through, and the path also narrowed between the low bushes on either side.</t4324><t4325>Elizabeth wanted to explore along the trail, but they realized they had gone quite far, and Mrs. Gardiner, due to her frail health, could not go any further and wished to return to the carriage as quickly as possible.</t4325><t4326>Her niece had to comply with her.</t4326><t4327>They followed the riverbank back to the mansion by the shortest route.</t4327><t4328>But they could not move quickly because Mr. Gardiner, who was very fond of fishing despite having few opportunities, was captivated by the occasional appearance of trout on the water's surface, and as he walked slowly, he conversed with the gardener.</t4328><t4329>While they were leisurely like this, once again the three were surprised, and Elizabeth was as astonished as the last time, when they saw Mr. Darcy approaching.</t4329><t4330>This area had fewer trees than the opposite bank, so they saw him before they met.</t4330><t4331>Though surprised, Elizabeth was somewhat more prepared than before to respond to him, intending to remain calm if indeed he wanted to meet them.</t4331><t4332>For a moment, she thought he seemed to want to take a different path.</t4332><t4333>He disappeared around a bend, then suddenly appeared before them.</t4333><t4334>With just a glance, she saw that he maintained the same courteous demeanor as before, and to mimic his manner, when they faced each other, she began to praise the scenery there.</t4334><t4335>But before she could say more than "beautiful" or "charming," she remembered something, and she imagined that he might misunderstand her praise of Pemberley.</t4335><t4336>She blushed deeply and said nothing more.</t4336>
<t4337>Mrs. Gardiner stood behind her.</t4337> <t4338>When she stopped speaking, he asked if she could grant him the honor of being introduced to her companions.</t4338> <t4339>This was a courtesy that completely surprised her, and she could hardly conceal a smile when she saw that he wanted to be acquainted with the very people who had stirred his pride.</t4339> <t4340>She thought, "How surprised he will be when he knows who they are!"</t4340> <t4341>He must think they are people of high society.</t4341>
<t4342>However, she still introduced the two sides to each other.</t4342> <t4343>When she informed him about the relationship between the two people and herself, she cunningly watched his reaction, thinking he would flee as quickly as possible to avoid associating with such lowly individuals.</t4343> <t4344>Clearly, his face showed surprise, but he stubbornly suppressed it; instead of walking away, he turned to look at them and started a conversation with Mr. Gardiner.</t4344> <t4345>Elizabeth couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction, a sense of victory.</t4345> <t4346>She found comfort in the fact that he should know she had relationships she was not ashamed of.</t4346> <t4347>She attentively listened to their exchange, delighted with every word her uncle spoke that demonstrated his intelligence, his taste, or his gentle demeanor.</t4347>
<t4348>The conversation shifted to the topic of fishing, and she heard Mr. Darcy, with utmost politeness, invite him to fish there whenever he wished, offering to lend him his fishing gear and pointing out the best spots.</t4348> <t4349>Mrs. Gardiner, walking hand in hand with Elizabeth, looked at her with astonishment.</t4349> <t4350>Elizabeth said nothing, but felt extremely pleased; all good thoughts were for her.</t4350> <t4351>However, she was utterly astonished, and kept wondering: "Why has he changed so much? Where did this come from?</t4351> <t4352>It can't be because of me, it can't be for me that his attitude has become so gentle.</t4352> <t4353>My scolding him at Huntsford couldn't have made him change this much.</t4353> <t4354>There's no way he still loves me."</t4354>
<t4355>After having walked such a distance, with two women in front and two men behind, and as they went down near the riverbank to observe some strange aquatic plant, they wanted to make a slight change.</t4355> <t4356>This was because Mrs. Gardiner, tired from the long distance, saw that Elizabeth could not support her, so she wanted to lean on her husband.</t4356> <t4357>Mr. Darcy took Mrs. Gardiner's place, and they walked together.</t4357> <t4358>After a moment of silence, Elizabeth began to speak.</t4358> <t4359>She wanted him to understand clearly that she had heard he was absent before she came here, so she remarked that his return was completely unexpected.</t4359> <t4360>She continued:</t4360>
<t4361>- Because your housekeeper assured us that you would definitely return tomorrow; and in fact, before we left Bakewell, we were informed that you would not return soon.</t4361>
<t4362>He accepted that she was sincere, because he had little work with the butler so he had to return earlier than his friends.</t4362> <t4363>He continued:</t4363>
<t4364>- They will come here tomorrow morning, among them are a few people you know – Mr. Bingley and his sisters.</t4364>
<t4365>Elizabeth only responded with a slight nod.</t4365> <t4366>Her thoughts flashed back to the time, that day, when the two of them mentioned Mr. Bingley's name, and if she guessed correctly from his expression, he was having the same thought.</t4366> <t4367>He continued after a moment of silence:</t4367>
<t4368>- There is someone else in the group who wants to get to know you.</t4368> <t4369>Would it be possible for you to allow me, if I am not asking too much, to introduce my sister to you during your stay in Lambton?</t4369>
<t4370>She was surprised again, to the point that she did not know how to respond affirmatively.</t4370> <t4371>She immediately thought that any desire of Miss Darcy to get acquainted with her must have been orchestrated by her brother.</t4371> <t4372>It was quite encouraging to know that although he was upset with her, he did not actually think ill of her.</t4372>
<t4373>Two people walked in silence, each immersed in their own thoughts.</t4373> <t4374>Elizabeth was uncomfortable, as it could not be otherwise, but she felt smug and pleased.</t4374> <t4375>His intention to introduce his sister to her was the best thing he could offer her.</t4375> <t4376>They walked faster than the other two, and by the time they reached the carriage, the couple was still a quarter of a mile away.</t4376>
<t4377>Then he invited her into the house, but she said she did not feel tired, and they stood together on the lawn.</t4377> <t4378>At this moment, many things could have been said, while silence caused awkwardness.</t4378> <t4379>She wanted to speak, but seemed unable to find a topic.</t4379> <t4380>Finally, she remembered that she was on a tour, so they ended up talking about the sights.</t4380> <t4381>However, time and her aunt moved slowly, and her patience and ideas were nearly exhausted before the encounter ended.</t4381> <t4382>When Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner arrived, he earnestly invited the three of them into the house for refreshments, but they declined.</t4382> <t4383>They parted with utmost politeness.</t4383> <t4384>Mr. Darcy helped the two women into the carriage; and as it rolled away, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly back into the house.</t4384>
<t4385>Uncle and aunt now began their comments; each said that he was certainly much better than they had initially thought.</t4385> <t4386>Uncle said:</t4386>
<t4387>- He is truly a modest, polite, and unpretentious person.</t4387>
<t4388>The aunt replied:</t4388>
<t4389>- There is certainly something dignified about him, but it is in a form that is not excessive.</t4389> <t4390>Now I agree with the housekeeper that although some people may think he is proud, I don't see it at all.</t4390>
<t4391>- I have never been so surprised by his manner.</t4391> <t4392>More than politeness, it was attentiveness; such concern was unnecessary.</t4392> <t4393>He and Elizabeth were only very casually acquainted.</t4393>
<t4394>Auntie said:</t4394>
<t4395>- Lizzy, it's true that I am not as handsome as Wickham; or in other words, I don't have Wickham's face, because my figure is perfect.</t4395> <t4396>But why do you say that he is very unpleasant?</t4396>
<t4397>Elizabeth tried to justify herself; she said that she liked him more when they met in Kent than before; and that she had never found him as pleasant as this morning.</t4397>
<t4398>Uncle answered:</t4398>
<t4399>- But perhaps he has a somewhat erratic nature when it comes to politeness.</t4399> <t4400>All of your friends are like that, so you wouldn't truly believe his invitation to go fishing, because one day he might change his mind and forbid you from coming near.</t4400>
<t4401>Elizabeth thought the couple were completely mistaken about his character, but she remained silent.</t4401>
<t4402>Mrs. Gardiner continued:</t4402>
<t4403>- From what we see, honestly, you shouldn't have thought he could behave cruelly towards anyone, as Wickham said.</t4403> <t4404>He doesn't look like a bad person.</t4404> <t4405>On the contrary, there is something pleasant in his words.</t4405> <t4406>And there is a certain dignity in his face that does not indicate he has a bad heart.</t4406> <t4407>But surely the lady who took us to see the house spoke very highly of him! At times, you almost couldn't help but laugh.</t4407> <t4408>But I think he is a generous master, and this, in the eyes of a servant, is enough to encompass all virtues.</t4408>
<t4409>Elizabeth felt the need to say something to vindicate his attitude towards Wickham.</t4409> <t4410>In the most cautious words possible, she explained to them that from what she had heard from his relatives in Kent, his actions could be explained differently, that his character was not as flawed as they thought, and that Wickham was not as amiable as the people in Hertfordshire believed.</t4410> <t4411>To confirm this, she recounted all the details of the strange relations between the two young men without specifying who said what, only indicating that these events could be trusted.</t4411>
<t4412>Mrs. Gardiner felt surprised and concerned, but when she arrived at the scene she had enjoyed in the past, all thoughts gave way to enchanting memories, and she was too busy pointing out interesting spots in the area to her husband to think of anything else.</t4412> <t4413>Although tired from the morning walk, after dinner she visited old acquaintances, and she was pleased with the relationships rekindled after many years of interruption.</t4413>
<t4414>The events of the day occupied Elizabeth's mind entirely, so she could do nothing but think, and think with amazement, about Mr. Darcy's courteous behavior, especially about his desire for her to become acquainted with his sister.</t4414>
<t4415>Chapter 44</t4415>
<t4416>Elizabeth guessed that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her on the very day she arrived at Pemberley, so she planned not to stray far from the inn that entire morning.</t4416> <t4417>But she was mistaken, for the very morning after they arrived in Lambton, their two guests came.</t4417> <t4418>The three had strolled around the area with a few new friends; just as they returned to the inn to change clothes for a meal with these friends' family, they heard the sound of a carriage, and through the window, they saw a man and a woman driving a two-wheeled carriage along the road.</t4418> <t4419>Immediately, Elizabeth recognized the noble attire, expressing her surprise to her uncle and aunt about the honor their guests were bestowing upon her.</t4419> <t4420>The uncle and aunt were equally astonished.</t4420> <t4421>The awkwardness when she spoke to them, combined with the current situation and many past situations, led them to a new thought.</t4421> <t4422>Nothing had been said about this before, but now they thought there was no other way to explain such attentions from the upper class, except for the affection they had for their niece.</t4422> <t4423>While these ideas passed through their minds, Elizabeth's state of anxiety grew higher and higher.</t4423> <t4424>She found it strange that she was losing her composure, but among the reasons for her agitation, she feared that his feelings for her might have spoken too highly of her to his sister.</t4424> <t4425>More than the anxiety of wanting to please, she feared that she no longer had the ability to please anyone at all.</t4425>
<t4426>She stepped away from the window, afraid of being seen; and as she paced back and forth in the room trying to stay calm, she saw the surprised looks of her uncle and aunt, which made her even more agitated.</t4426>
<t4427>Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and the introduction – the dreadful introduction in her mind – took place.</t4427> <t4428>Elizabeth was surprised to notice that the younger sister was just as flustered as she was.</t4428> <t4429>Since arriving in Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was extremely proud, but after only a few minutes of observation, Elizabeth was convinced that she was merely excessively shy.</t4429> <t4430>The younger sister could hardly complete a sentence, only uttering a few short words.</t4430>
<t4431>Miss Darcy is tall and somewhat larger than Elizabeth.</t4431> <t4432>Although she is just over sixteen, she already has the figure of a graceful and mature woman.</t4432> <t4433>She is not as handsome as her brother, but her face shows a sense of propriety and cheerfulness, and her demeanor is entirely gentle and unpretentious.</t4433> <t4434>Previously, Elizabeth had thought she might be someone with keen and sharp observational skills, but now she felt relieved to realize the opposite.</t4434>
<t4435>They only managed to exchange a few words when Darcy informed her that Bingley was also coming to visit her.</t4435> <t4436>Before she had time to express her joy and prepare for the new guest, she heard footsteps coming up the stairs, and then he entered.</t4436> <t4437>All of Elizabeth's anger towards him had long since dissipated, but now, even if any remnants remained, they completely vanished due to his friendly and unpretentious demeanor when he met her again.</t4437> <t4438>He inquired warmly, though generally, about her family's health, looking and speaking with the same natural and cheerful manner as before.</t4438>
<t4439>For Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, Mr. Bingley was a character worth paying attention to just as much as their niece.</t4439> <t4440>They had long wanted to meet him.</t4440> <t4441>In fact, the entire group of guests before them had sparked lively attention.</t4441> <t4442>Their suspicions about Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their attention to each guest with eager yet cautious inquiries, and soon from these inquiries, they were convinced that at least one of the two knew what love was.</t4442> <t4443>They had doubts about their niece's feelings, but it was clear to them that the other was overflowing with affection.</t4443>
<t4444>As for Elizabeth, she had many things to do.</t4444> <t4445>She wanted to understand the thoughts of each guest, she wanted to remain calm, and she wanted to appear pleasant to everyone.</t4445> <t4446>Regarding the last task, which she feared failing the most, she was confident she would succeed, because everyone she wanted to please had a favorable opinion of her.</t4446> <t4447>Bingley was willing, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy was intentionally pleased.</t4447>
<t4448>When she met Mr. Bingley again, her thoughts naturally turned to her sister, and she was eager to know what was on his mind.</t4448> <t4449>Sometimes she imagined that he was less talkative than in previous encounters, and occasionally she was pleased to notice that when he looked at her, he was searching for similarities between the two sisters.</t4449> <t4450>But, although this might have been mere imagination, she could not be deceived by his attitude towards Miss Darcy, who had been presented as Jane's rival.</t4450> <t4451>Neither of them showed any signs of affection.</t4451> <t4452>Nothing occurred between the two that could justify Miss Darcy's hopes.</t4452> <t4453>She felt immediately satisfied on this point, and there were a few small incidents before they parted, which, in her eager interpretation, indicated that he had fleeting recollections of Jane, marked by a gentle demeanor and a desire to inquire further about something that might lead to mentioning Jane, if he dared.</t4453> <t4454>While the others were conversing, he spoke to her in a voice tinged with regret, saying that it had been a long time since he last saw Jane, and before she could respond, he added that it had been over eight months since the 26th of October when they danced together at Netherfield.</t4454>
<t4455>Elizabeth was pleased to see that his memory was so accurate, and then taking advantage of the opportunity when no one was standing next to them, he asked her if all her sisters were at Longbourn.</t4455> <t4456>The question was not much, just like the previous one, but with an attitude and gesture that conveyed some meaning.</t4456>
<t4457>She did not often look at Mr. Darcy, but whenever she glanced at him, she always noticed a kind demeanor, and in every word he spoke, she detected a tone that no longer seemed arrogant or disdainful.</t4457> <t4458>This convinced her that the improvement in his character, which she had noticed before, had lasted for more than just two days.</t4458> <t4459>When she saw him wanting to get acquainted and win the approval of people he had not wanted to associate with a few months ago, when she saw him being polite not only to her but also to those he had previously openly scorned, and recalled the vivid scene at the Huntsford Parsonage; the differences, the changes were so great, striking her consciousness so strongly, that she could hardly contain her expression of astonishment.</t4459> <t4460>Never, even when he was among his close friends at Netherfield, or his noble relatives at Rosings, had she seen him so eager to please others, so devoid of arrogance, or as comfortable as he was now, while gaining no significant benefit from this attitude, even though this interaction would cause the ladies at Netherfield and Rosings to mock and criticize him.</t4460>
<t4461>The three people stayed for just over half an hour.</t4461> <t4462>When they stood up to say goodbye, Mr. Darcy asked his sister to join him in inviting Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner and Miss Bennet to dine at Pemberley before their departure.</t4462> <t4463>Miss Darcy readily obeyed, though with a lack of confidence in extending the invitation, due to her nature.</t4463> <t4464>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, as she was the main subject of the invitation, to see how she would respond, but Elizabeth had turned away.</t4464> <t4465>However, she guessed that this was due to shyness rather than a desire to refuse; and seeing that her husband enjoyed socializing, she suggested that her niece accept, and they arranged to meet two days later.</t4465>
<t4466>Bingley expressed genuine joy at the prospect of seeing Elizabeth again, as he still had many things he wanted to discuss with her and many questions to ask about his friends at Netherfield.</t4466> <t4467>Elizabeth was pleased, thinking he wanted to hear her talk about her sister.</t4467> <t4468>When the guests had left, Elizabeth reflected on the recent events and felt satisfied.</t4468> <t4469>Desiring privacy and wary of her uncle and aunt's questions or insinuations, she lingered only a moment to hear them praise Bingley, then excused herself to go change her clothes.</t4469>
<t4470>But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; they did not want to press her to disclose anything.</t4470> <t4471>They clearly saw that she was more acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had thought; and it was also evident that he loved her deeply.</t4471> <t4472>They had noticed many things worthy of their attention, but there was nothing that needed to be asked.</t4472>
<t4473>Regarding Mr. Darcy, this is a matter of concern that requires her to think clearly.</t4473> <t4474>According to the acquaintance they have just established, the couple did not find anything lacking.</t4474> <t4475>They could not be indifferent to his courteous demeanor, and if they judged him based on their feelings combined with the housekeeper's affection but disregarded other opinions, those who knew him in Hertfordshire would not recognize this as Mr. Darcy.</t4475> <t4476>However, now is the time to consider whether to trust the housekeeper or not.</t4476> <t4477>They realized that it would not be wise to hastily dismiss the opinion of a respectable servant who had known him since he was four.</t4477> <t4478>They also did not hear their friends in Lambton speak ill of him.</t4478> <t4479>These people had nothing to accuse him of except pride.</t4479> <t4480>Perhaps he is proud, or it could be that those living in a small town who are less acquainted with him said so.</t4480> <t4481>However, they acknowledged that he was a generous person who had done many good deeds for the poor.</t4481>
<t4482>As for Wickham, the couple did not think highly of him.</t4482> <t4483>Although they did not fully understand what he complained about regarding the son of the patron who took care of him, they knew one thing for sure: when he left Derbyshire, he left behind many debts that Mr. Darcy had to settle afterward.</t4483>
<t4484>As for Elizabeth, her thoughts about Pemberley tonight were even more complicated than the day before.</t4484><t4485>Although the evening seemed to pass slowly, it was not slow enough for her to determine her feelings for a certain resident of that estate, and she lay awake for two hours trying to find an answer.</t4485><t4486>Surely, she did not hate him.</t4486><t4487>No, the thought of hatred had long vanished, and for a long time, she had felt ashamed of having harbored such thoughts, one might say.</t4487><t4488>The respect born from her belief in his noble qualities, although initially she did not want to admit it, no longer conflicted with her feelings.</t4488><t4489>Now, that respect had grown to a more intimate level, through her good opinions of him, making him more likable, as past events had shown.</t4489><t4490>But above all, above respect and affection, there was in her a driving force of goodwill that could not be ignored.</t4490><t4491>It was emotion.</t4491><t4492>Emotion not just because someone loved her, but because he loved her so deeply that he forgave all her impulsiveness and sharpness when rejecting his proposal, and forgave all the unjust accusations that followed the rejection.</t4492><t4493>She had thought he would avoid her like the worst enemy; but when he unexpectedly met her again, he seemed to want to maintain a relationship with her.</t4493><t4494>Without any lack of tact or odd gestures, he had won the good opinion of her relatives and even wanted his sister to become acquainted with her.</t4494><t4495>Such a change in a very proud man not only astonished her but also moved her – for this was due to love, deep love.</t4495><t4496>Therefore, the impression within her was something that should be encouraged, certainly not unpleasant, though it could not be clearly defined.</t4496><t4497>She respected him, liked him, was moved by him.</t4497><t4498>She genuinely cared about his happiness.</t4498><t4499>She only wanted to know how much she desired that his happiness depended on her and how much she would use her abilities for the happiness of both.</t4499><t4500>She thought she still had the ability to lead him to propose to her again.</t4500>
<t4501>In the evening, the aunt and the niece agreed that according to the standards of etiquette on their part, they needed to return the visit to Miss Darcy, who had been extremely courteous when she visited them immediately upon returning to Pemberley, even though their return visit could not be equivalent.</t4501> <t4502>They decided they needed to visit her at Pemberley the next morning.</t4502> <t4503>Thus, the aunt and niece went together.</t4503> <t4504>Elizabeth felt happy, though when she silently asked herself the reason for her happiness, she could not provide much of an answer.</t4504>
<t4505>Mr. Gardiner left after breakfast.</t4505> <t4506>The day before, he had once again been invited to go fishing and had agreed to meet some people at Pemberley in the afternoon.</t4506>
<t4507>Chapter 45</t4507>
<t4508>Elizabeth was now convinced that Miss Bingley disliked her purely out of jealousy.</t4508> <t4509>She wondered how Miss Bingley would receive her at Pemberley, curious to know how this young woman would treat her once her relationship with Mr. Darcy was rekindled.</t4509>
<t4510>When they arrived at the mansion, the two were led through the foyer to enter the great hall, which opened to the north and looked beautiful in the summer.</t4510> <t4511>The windows extended to the ground, revealing a refreshing view of the forest-covered hills behind the mansion, with oaks and chestnuts scattered across the adjacent lawn.</t4511>
<t4512>They were received by Miss Darcy; she was sitting with Mrs. Hunts and Miss Bingley, along with a lady who lived with her in London.</t4512> <t4513>Georgiana was very polite in receiving the two, but with a confused manner due to shyness and the fear of making mistakes, which could make someone of lower class mistakenly think that she was proud and fastidious.</t4513> <t4514>However, Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth thought rightly of her, feeling sorry for her.</t4514>
<t4515>Mrs. Hunts and Miss Bingley only inclined their heads to greet them.</t4515> <t4516>After everyone sat down, there was an awkward moment, broken by Mrs. Annesley.</t4516> <t4517>She was a gentle, pleasant woman; when she wanted to start a conversation, she demonstrated that she was truly better educated than the others.</t4517> <t4518>The conversation took place between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with Elizabeth occasionally joining in.</t4518> <t4519>It seemed that Miss Darcy needed to muster enough courage to contribute, and she occasionally added a short sentence when there was the least risk of being overheard by others.</t4519>
<t4520>Elizabeth immediately realized that Miss Bingley was observing her closely.</t4520> <t4521>This would not have prevented her from joining the conversation if she were not in an inconvenient position, but she did not regret having to speak less.</t4521> <t4522>She was preoccupied with the thought that at any moment some gentlemen would enter the room.</t4522> <t4523>She both wished for and feared the presence of the master of the estate among them, and she could not discern whether she wished or feared it more.</t4523> <t4524>After sitting for a while without hearing Miss Bingley, Elizabeth heard her coldly inquiring about her family's health.</t4524> <t4525>She responded with the same coldness and brevity, and Miss Bingley said nothing more.</t4525>
<t4526>The servants brought in cold meats, pastries, and some of the finest seasonal fruits; this was only after Mrs. Annesley had repeatedly glanced and smiled at Miss Darcy to remind her of her position.</t4526> <t4527>Now they had something to do, for if they could not talk, they could eat, and they gathered around the table adorned with fresh grapes, tangerines, and peaches.</t4527>
<t4528>At that moment, Elizabeth had the opportunity to determine whether she wished for or feared Mr. Darcy's appearance more, through the emotions that arose within her as he entered. Just a moment ago, she believed she wished for it more, but now she began to regret that he had come.</t4528>
<t4529>He was standing by the river with Mr. Gardiner and a few of his friends when he was informed that there were guests.</t4529> <t4530>As soon as he appeared, Elizabeth wisely resolved that she needed to appear completely at ease and not flustered.</t4530> <t4531>Thinking it was easy but doing it could be difficult, because when he entered, she felt all the curiosity was focused on the two of them, with every eye keenly observing his demeanor.</t4531> <t4532>Miss Bingley's face showed the most attentive curiosity although she always smiled when talking, because jealousy had not yet made her desperate, she had not ceased to pay attention to Mr. Darcy.</t4532> <t4533>When she saw her brother enter, Miss Darcy spoke more, and Elizabeth noticed that he wanted her and his sister to become more acquainted, so he tried to draw the two into the conversation.</t4533> <t4534>Miss Bingley also knew this, and in a rash moment of anger, she seized the first opportunity to speak, with a polite mocking tone:</t4534>
<t4535>- Miss Elizabeth, has the militia regiment moved away from Meryton?</t4535> <t4536>This must be a great loss for your family.</t4536>
<t4537>In front of Darcy, she did not dare to mention Wickham by name, but Elizabeth immediately understood that he was present in her thoughts, and Elizabeth felt a moment of pain when memories of him were mentioned.</t4537> <t4538>However, she tried to counter the attack with ill intent, answering the question by distancing herself from the issue.</t4538> <t4539>While she spoke, she inadvertently glanced at her brother Darcy and saw his tense, worried face looking at her; meanwhile, her sister showed a confused expression, unable to lift her eyes.</t4539> <t4540>If Miss Bingley understood the pain she had caused her dear friend Darcy, she certainly would not have implied such things.</t4540> <t4541>She only wanted to embarrass Elizabeth to force her opponent to reveal emotions that could harm Darcy's feelings, perhaps to remind him of the recklessness and impropriety associated with some members of Elizabeth's family involved with the regiment.</t4541> <t4542>She knew nothing about Miss Darcy's intention to elope with her lover.</t4542> <t4543>The news was not disclosed to anyone except Elizabeth, and Darcy particularly kept it secret from all of Bingley's connections.</t4543> <t4544>This stemmed from the very wish that Elizabeth previously thought was his, that the relationships between the two young men would also become her relationships.</t4544> <t4545>He certainly had such a plan, and while he had no intention of separating Bingley and Miss Bennet, the plan might have caused him to worry about his friend's happiness.</t4545>
<t4546>However, Elizabeth's calm reaction reassured him, and when Miss Bingley, frustrated and disappointed, no longer dared to imply anything about Wickham, Georgiana also calmed down, though not enough to say anything further.</t4546> <t4547>Her brother no longer remembered much about his sister's affair, and the very circumstances created to distract him from Elizabeth made him pay even more attention to Elizabeth, and he became even more cheerful.</t4547>
<t4548>The two people did not stay seated for much longer.</t4548> <t4549>While Mr. Darcy escorted them to their carriage, Miss Bingley vented her anger through comments about Elizabeth's character, manners, and attire.</t4549> <t4550>But Georgiana did not join her.</t4550> <t4551>Her brother's opinion was enough for her to follow: she believed her brother's judgment was infallible, and he had spoken so many good things about Elizabeth that she could see nothing but beauty and charm in her.</t4551> <t4552>When Mr. Darcy returned, Miss Bingley couldn't help but repeat some of the things she had said to his sister:</t4552>
<t4553>- Mr. Darcy, Eliza Bennet looked so ugly this morning.</t4553> <t4554>In my life, I have never seen anyone change so much since last winter.</t4554> <t4555>She has become so dark and coarse!</t4555> <t4556>Louisa and I have agreed that we do not want to see her anymore.</t4556>
<t4557>Although Mr. Darcy might not be very fond of such words, he still coldly replied that he saw no change except for her tanned skin – which was not the result of a miracle when one travels during the summer.</t4557>
<t4558>Miss Bingley added:</t4558>
<t4559>- As for me, I must admit that I have never seen any beauty in her.</t4559> <t4560>Her face is too thin, her complexion is not bright, and her figure is not elegant.</t4560> <t4561>Her nose needs more character, there is nothing remarkable about it.</t4561> <t4562>Her teeth look decent, but they are just ordinary, and as for her eyes, which some people occasionally claim are beautiful, I have never found anything special about them.</t4562> <t4563>Her eyes have a sharp, harsh look that I do not like at all.</t4563> <t4564>And in her entire demeanor, there is a self-satisfaction that is not polite and is unacceptable.</t4564>
<t4565>When Miss Bingley believed that Mr. Darcy was fond of Elizabeth, this was not the best way to elevate herself.</t4565> <t4566>But angry people are not always rational, and seeing that he seemed irritated, she thought she had succeeded.</t4566> <t4567>But he remained resolutely silent, and wanting him to speak, she continued:</t4567>
<t4568>- I still remember, when we first met her in Hertfordshire, we were surprised to see that she was beautiful.</t4568> <t4569>I particularly remember one day after they had dinner at Netherfield, you said, "Her, beautiful! –</t4569> <t4570>I think her mother was quite witty.”</t4570> <t4571>But after that, she seemed somewhat better to you, so I believe at some point you thought she was quite pretty.</t4571>
<t4572>Darcy replied, when he could no longer hold back:</t4572>
<t4573>- Yes, but that was only when I first got to know her, and for many months afterwards I considered her the most beautiful among the people I knew.</t4573>
<t4574>Then he walked away, leaving Miss Bingley sitting with the satisfaction of having forced him to speak, but what he said only caused her pain.</t4574>
<t4575>Upon returning, Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth conversed about the events of their visit, except for the points each was most interested in.</t4575> <t4576>They discussed the demeanor and gestures of everyone they had met, except for the person they paid the most attention to.</t4576> <t4577>They talked about his sister, his friends, his estate, the fruits, everything, except about him; but Elizabeth was very eager to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, while Mrs. Gardiner would have been very pleased if her niece had broached the subject.</t4577>
<t4578>Chapter 46</t4578>
<t4579>Elizabeth was very disappointed when she arrived in Lambton and did not see a letter from Jane, and even more disappointed the next day.</t4579> <t4580>But on the third day, she was no longer upset, her sister was vindicated when two letters arrived at the same time, one of which had been misdirected somewhere.</t4580> <t4581>Elizabeth was not surprised by this, as her sister had written the address unclearly.</t4581>
<t4582>They were ready to go for a walk when she received two letters.</t4582> <t4583>Her uncle and aunt went ahead to give her some privacy.</t4583> <t4584>She needed to read the misdelivered letter that was written five days ago first.</t4584> <t4585>At the beginning, the letter talked about small interactions and some other news, but the latter part, dated the next day, seemed to be written in a disturbed state of mind, conveying more important news:</t4585>
<t4586>“Dear Lizzy, since writing the above, an unexpected and serious matter has occurred, but I fear you will worry – rest assured that our whole family is healthy.</t4586> <t4587>The matter I am about to tell you concerns Lydia.</t4587> <t4588>An urgent message arrived at midnight last night, informing us that she has eloped to Scotland with an officer: to be precise, Wickham! Imagine the astonishment of the household.</t4588> <t4589>However, for Kitty, this was not entirely unexpected. I am sad, very sad.</t4589> <t4590>Both are reckless.</t4590> <t4591>But I want to hope for the best, that his character has been misunderstood.</t4591> <t4592>I can easily believe he lacks judgment and discretion, but that there is nothing bad in his soul.</t4592> <t4593>At least he has no intention of taking advantage of her, for he must know that father has nothing to leave her.</t4593> <t4594>Our poor mother is very distressed.</t4594> <t4595>Father is bearing it better.</t4595> <t4596>I am very glad that we never let them know what people have been saying about him; we should forget these matters.</t4596>
<t4597>The two people left around 12 o'clock on Saturday night, it is guessed, but it wasn't until 8 o'clock yesterday morning that people found out.</t4597> <t4598>An urgent letter was sent immediately.</t4598> <t4599>Dear Lizzy, they must have passed by our house about ten miles away.</t4599> <t4600>Colonel Forster announced the reason to come to the house.</t4600> <t4601>Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of her intentions.</t4601> <t4602>I have to end the letter here, because I don't want to be away from mother for long.</t4602> <t4603>I'm worried you won't understand the whole story, but I don't even know what I've written.”</t4603>
<t4604>Not allowing herself time to think and not knowing what she was thinking, after finishing the first letter, Elizabeth hastily opened the second letter to read, which was written one day after the previous letter.</t4604>
<t4605>“My dear, at this moment you have received the previous letter I wrote in haste.</t4605> <t4606>I hope this letter is clearer, but my mind is still confused so perhaps it is still not coherent.</t4606>
<t4607>Dearest Lizzy, I don't know what to write, but I have bad news for you, which cannot be delayed.</t4607> <t4608>Although the marriage between Wickham and the poor girl is imprudent, the family is anxious to hear that they have married, as there are many reasons to fear they did not go to Scotland.</t4608> <t4609>Colonel Forster came to the house yesterday, after leaving Brington the day before, a few hours after the urgent news.</t4609> <t4610>Although Lydia's letter to Mrs. F. stated that the two intended to go to Gretna Green.</t4610> <t4611>Denny has reason to believe that W. never intended to go there, nor to marry Lydia at all.</t4611> <t4612>Colonel F. immediately sent out a notice upon hearing this news, then left B. to trace their route.</t4612> <t4613>He tracked them to Clapham but lost the trail, as the two traveled there by a small carriage and then switched to a hired carriage.</t4613> <t4614>From there, they only know that the two were seen continuing on the road to London.</t4614> <t4615>I don't know what to think.</t4615> <t4616>After inquiring everywhere on that side of London, Colonel F. went to Hertfordshire, continuing to inquire at the turnings, at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but could not find them, no one had seen such a pair pass through.</t4616> <t4617>He was kind enough to visit the house, providing the news in the most reliable way from his heart.</t4617> <t4618>I also feel sorry for Mr. and Mrs. F. but no one can blame them.</t4618>
<t4619>Dear Lizzy, the family is in great distress.</t4619> <t4620>Both parents are thinking the worst, but she cannot think ill of her father.</t4620> <t4621>Many situations suggest that the two might marry discreetly in the city rather than pursue their original intention, and even if he had such intentions towards a young girl of a lower class like Lydia, unlikely as it may be, would the girl lose much?</t4621> <t4622>It cannot be.</t4622> <t4623>However, she is saddened to see that Colonel F. does not believe in the marriage; he shook his head when she expressed such a hope, and said he feared</t4623> <t4624>W. is not a trustworthy person.</t4624>
<t4625>The poor mother was really sick and stayed in her room.</t4625> <t4626>It would be better if she had more willpower, but one shouldn't count on that.</t4626> <t4627>As for the father, she had never seen him so emotional.</t4627> <t4628>The parents were angry with poor little Kitty for hiding the matter between the two, but this is a private issue that we cannot question.</t4628>
<t4629>Dear Lizzy, I am truly happy to see you avoid these painful scenes, but now that the initial shock has passed, can I hope for your return?</t4629> <t4630>However, I am not so selfish as to compel you, if it is not convenient.</t4630> <t4631>Goodbye.</t4631>
<t4632>You are picking up the pen to do what you just wrote above that you wouldn't do, because circumstances compel you to earnestly call for you to return as soon as possible.</t4632> <t4633>I understand uncle and aunt's nature well, so I am not afraid to make such a request, although I have other matters to ask of him.</t4633> <t4634>Father will go to London immediately with Colonel Forster to try to find the girl.</t4634> <t4635>I don't know exactly what father intends to do, but he is too distressed to act carefully, while Colonel Forster is obliged to return to Brighton tomorrow night.</t4635> <t4636>In this urgent matter, your opinion and support will be very helpful; he will immediately understand what I mean, and I am relying on his goodwill.</t4636>
<t4637>As soon as she finished reading the letter, Elizabeth exclaimed: "Oh!</t4637> <t4638>Where is my uncle, where is my uncle?", then ran outside, but when she reached the door, a servant opened it, and Mr. Darcy appeared.</t4638> <t4639>Her pale face and frantic demeanor stunned him, and before he could regain his composure, she hurriedly said:</t4639>
<t4640>- I'm sorry, but I have to go.</t4640> <t4641>I have to go find Mr. Gardiner now, because there's something that can't be delayed, I can't waste any time.</t4641>
<t4642>- My God! What happened?</t4642>
<t4643>Then he calmed himself down:</t4643>
<t4644>- I do not wish to detain you for a moment, but please allow me, or let a servant go find Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.</t4644> <t4645>You are not well – you cannot go by yourself.</t4645>
<t4646>Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees were trembling, and she thought it would be more disadvantageous if she went by herself.</t4646> <t4647>She called a servant over, with a breathless voice that was almost unintelligible, asking him to immediately find the couple.</t4647>
<t4648>Then she sat down, unable to stand on her own, and her appearance was so miserable that Darcy couldn't leave her, nor could he stop himself from asking about her, gently and sympathetically:</t4648>
<t4649>- Let me call your servant.</t4649> <t4650>Do you want anything to help you calm down?</t4650> <t4651>How about some wine, shall I get you a glass?</t4651> <t4652>You look very weak.</t4652>
<t4653>She replied, trying to center herself:</t4653>
<t4654>- No, thank you.</t4654> <t4655>I have nothing to worry about.</t4655> <t4656>I still feel fine.</t4656> <t4657>I am just saddened by the news I received from Longbourn.</t4657>
<t4658>She sobbed when she alluded to it, and for a few minutes couldn't say another word.</t4658> <t4659>In miserable tension, Darcy could only utter something incoherent about his concern, then silently watched her with compassion.</t4659> <t4660>Finally, she said:</t4660>
<t4661>- I just received a letter from Jane, with a dreadful piece of news.</t4661> <t4662>This news cannot be hidden from anyone.</t4662> <t4663>My youngest sister has left the family… has run away… has fallen under the influence of… of Mr. Wickham.</t4663> <t4664>They eloped from Brighton together. You know him too well to guess the rest.</t4664> <t4665>She has no money, no acquaintances, nothing to attract him… she will be gone forever.</t4665>
<t4666>Darcy was stunned into silence.</t4666> <t4667>She added, her voice trembling:</t4667>
<t4668>- When I think that I could have prevented this!...</t4668> <t4669>I knew about his character.</t4669> <t4670>If I had just explained a part… a part of what I knew, to my family!</t4670> <t4671>If everyone knew about his character, this couldn't have happened.</t4671> <t4672>But now it’s too late.</t4672>
<t4673>Darcy exclaimed:</t4673>
<t4674>- I am very sad, truly sad... I am shocked.</t4674> <t4675>But is this news correct, is it absolutely correct?</t4675>
<t4676>- Correct.</t4676> <t4677>They left Brighton on Sunday night, were tracked to London, then disappeared.</t4677> <t4678>They certainly did not go to Scotland.</t4678>
<t4679>- And what have people done to find her?</t4679>
<t4680>- My father has gone to London.</t4680> <t4681>Jane wrote a letter asking my uncle for help, while I hoped we could set off within half an hour.</t4681> <t4682>But nothing could be done, I knew very well that nothing could be done.</t4682> <t4683>How to find them?</t4683> <t4684>I had no hope.</t4684> <t4685>Everything was too terrible.</t4685>
<t4686>Darcy shook his head in acknowledgment.</t4686> <t4687>She continued:</t4687>
<t4688>- When I opened my eyes and realized his true nature... Oh! I wish I had known what to do, dared to do! But I didn't know... I was afraid of acting too harshly.</t4688> <t4689>Oh, the misery, it's all my fault!</t4689>
<t4690>Darcy did not reply.</t4690> <t4691>It seemed he did not hear everything she said, he was pacing thoughtfully; his eyebrows furrowed, his expression sorrowful.</t4691> <t4692>Before long, Elizabeth noticed and understood immediately.</t4692> <t4693>Her position was being overshadowed, everything would be overshadowed by the manifestation of a lowly family, an unmistakable sign of utmost humiliation.</t4693> <t4694>She could neither wonder nor condemn, but her belief in his love brought no comfort to her heart and could not soothe her sorrow.</t4694> <t4695>On the contrary, this belief was calculated to help her understand her own desires, and never had she truly thought she could love him as much as she did now, when all love had become hopeless.</t4695>
<t4696>But even though personal matters intertwined, they could not occupy all her mind.</t4696> <t4697>Lydia – the disgrace, the torment that her sister had brought upon the entire family, overshadowed all personal worries.</t4697> <t4698>Burying her face in her handkerchief, Elizabeth forgot everything else.</t4698> <t4699>After a while, she could only return to reality thanks to Darcy's voice, empathetic yet controlled.</t4699>
<t4700>- I fear you do not want my presence here, and I have nothing to ask to stay except for sincere concern, but it is of no help.</t4700> <t4701>I wish I could say or do something to help comfort you.</t4701> <t4702>But I do not want to trouble you with vain hopes that seem to be spoken only to seek your thanks. I fear with this unfortunate matter, my sister cannot have the honor of receiving you at Pemberley today.</t4702>
<t4703>- Ah yes.</t4703> <t4704>Please kindly apologize to Miss Darcy on our behalf, saying that an urgent matter calls us back immediately.</t4704> <t4705>Please keep this unfortunate matter confidential for as long as possible.</t4705> <t4706>I don't think it will be long.</t4706>
<t4707>He eagerly promised her that he would keep it a secret.</t4707> <t4708>Then he expressed his sympathy for her sorrow, hoping for a better outcome than the current reason for hope, and sent his regards to her relatives.</t4708> <t4709>Then, with just a solemn farewell glance, he left.</t4709>
<t4710>When he stepped out of the room, Elizabeth thought it was unlikely that he and she would meet again with the same friendliness as in their encounters in Derbyshire.</t4710> <t4711>When reflecting on the entire relationship between the two, full of conflicts and upheavals, she sighed for the tangled emotions that now should have been strengthened for the relationship to endure, whereas before she would have been glad if the relationship had ended.</t4711>
<t4712>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations for love, the change in Elizabeth's feelings is neither improbable nor faulty.</t4712> <t4713>But if not, if the affection arising from these sources is not justifiable, or not natural compared to what is commonly called the initial stage, nothing can excuse her, except perhaps her feelings for Wickham, and also except perhaps the failure that might allow her to seek another way.</t4713> <t4714>In any case, she regretted seeing him leave; and in the first instance of the consequences of Lydia's disgrace, she was even more distressed when recalling this unfortunate event.</t4714> <t4715>Since reading Jane's second letter, she had never hoped that Wickham would marry her sister.</t4715> <t4716>She thought no one, except Jane, could be complacent with such a hope.</t4716> <t4717>In her feelings about this matter, surprise held the smallest place.</t4717> <t4718>When she remembered the contents of the first letter, she was completely astonished—completely stunned that Wickham would want to marry a girl without money; and how Lydia could have captivated him was something she could not understand.</t4718> <t4719>But now, everything seemed natural.</t4719> <t4720>With such an affair, Lydia had enough charm, and although she did not think her sister had intentionally wanted to elope without intending to marry, it was not difficult for her to believe that neither her sister's virtue nor understanding could protect her from becoming an easy prey.</t4720>
<t4721>When the regiment was still stationed in Hertfordshire, she never realized that Lydia had any feelings for him, but she believed that Lydia only needed a little encouragement to fall in love with anyone.</t4721> <t4722>Sometimes an officer, sometimes another person was liked by Lydia just because of their attentions.</t4722> <t4723>Her sister's affections were always fluctuating, but there was never a lack of an object.</t4723> <t4724>The disaster of neglect and misguided indulgence of a daughter.</t4724> <t4725>Oh! Now she understood it deeply!</t4725>
<t4726>She was anxious to return home, to listen, to see, to be present at the place, to share with Jane all the care that her sister now had to bear alone, in a family that was in disarray.</t4726> <t4727>The father was absent, the mother could not get up and needed constant care, although she believed there was hardly anything she could do for Lydia, the support of the uncle would be extremely important, she continued to suffer from impatience waiting for the uncle to return.</t4727>
<t4728>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner returned in worry, thinking that their niece had fallen ill suddenly, as the servant had informed them, but were immediately reassured about this matter.</t4728> <t4729>She immediately explained the reason she had sent for them, trembling as she read the two letters to them.</t4729> <t4730>Although Lydia was never the niece they particularly cherished, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were still deeply moved.</t4730> <t4731>It was not only Lydia, but everyone involved.</t4731> <t4732>After a few expressions of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner eagerly promised to help in any way he could.</t4732> <t4733>They would return as soon as possible.</t4733> <t4734>Mrs. Gardiner exclaimed:</t4734>
<t4735>- But what will we do with Pemberley?</t4735> <t4736>John said that Mr. Darcy came here when you sent him to call your uncle and aunt.</t4736> <t4737>Is that correct?</t4737>
<t4738>- Yes; I told Mr. Darcy that we would not be able to keep our promise.</t4738> <t4739>This matter has been settled.</t4739>
<t4740>The aunt repeated, as she ran into the room to prepare: "This matter has been arranged."</t4740> <t4741>And I don't know how close the two of you are for the niece to reveal the truth!</t4741> <t4742>Oh, if only I had known what the situation was like!”</t4742>
<t4743>But all wishes were futile, or at least only helped her feel better in the rush and confusion of the next hour.</t4743> <t4744>If Elizabeth had been at leisure, she would have been convinced that she could not accomplish anything while in such distress; but she had as much to do as her aunt, including writing letters to inform everyone in Lambton, with a fabricated reason for their sudden departure.</t4744> <t4745>However, within an hour, everything was settled.</t4745> <t4746>After a miserable morning, Elizabeth found that she could return to Longbourn sooner than she had thought.</t4746>
<t4747>Chapter 47</t4747>
<t4748>When they drove out of town, the uncle said to her:</t4748>
<t4749>- Elizabeth, you have thought over the matter, and after serious consideration, now you can truly be ready to judge the matter better, just as your sister has judged.</t4749> <t4750>You think there is no reason why a young man would intend to marry a girl with no guaranteed fortune and no friends, while she is actually staying with his colonel's family.</t4750> <t4751>Can he rely on his friends to help him?</t4751> <t4752>After confronting Colonel Forster, does he think he will be reprimanded by the regiment?</t4752> <t4753>His actions are not worth taking such risks.</t4753>
<t4754>Elizabeth exclaimed, her face momentarily lighting up with joy:</t4754>
<t4755>- Do you really believe that</t4755><t4756>?</t4756>
<t4757>Mrs. Gardiner said:</t4757>
<t4758>- Honestly, I am beginning to think like your uncle.</t4758> <t4759>This is too grave an error in terms of propriety, honor, and rights, not deserving of him being accused.</t4759> <t4760>I cannot believe Wickham could be that bad.</t4760> <t4761>Lizzy, you yourself, can you believe he is capable of doing such a thing?</t4761>
<t4762>- Perhaps he won't overlook your rights, but I believe he can overlook everything else.</t4762> <t4763>But why didn't they go to Scotland if that's the case?</t4763>
<t4764>Mr. Gardiner replied:</t4764>
<t4765>- First of all, there is no conclusive evidence that they did not go to Scotland.</t4765>
<t4766>- Ah! But the fact that they switched from a horse-drawn carriage to a rented vehicle allows us to infer that.</t4766> <t4767>And furthermore, no trace of the two was found along Barnet Street.</t4767>
<t4768>- Alright, then suppose they are in London.</t4768> <t4769>They might be there for the purpose of hiding, not for any other exceptional reason.</t4769> <t4770>Each person might not have much money, and they think they can get married more cheaply, though slowly, in London than in Scotland.</t4770>
<t4771>- But why keep it a secret?</t4771> <t4772>Why be afraid of being discovered?</t4772> <t4773>Why must the marriage be kept secret?</t4773> <t4774>Oh, no, no, it makes no sense.</t4774> <t4775>His closest friend, according to Jane, believes that he never had any intention of marrying.</t4775> <t4776>Wickham would never marry someone without money.</t4776> <t4777>He does not have the financial means to do so.</t4777> <t4778>And what does Lydia have, what attractive qualities beyond youth, health, and cheerfulness, that could make him give up every opportunity for a wealthy marriage?</t4778> <t4779>As for his fear of being despised by the army for eloping in disgrace, I cannot judge, because I do not know the consequences of this situation.</t4779> <t4780>As for your argument, I fear it has no basis.</t4780> <t4781>Lydia has no brothers to hope for help from, and from my father's attitude, his laziness, and his lack of attention to what is happening in the family, one could think that he would do as little as possible and think as little as possible about this matter, like any other father.</t4781>
<t4782>- But can you think that Lydia would lose so much except for your love, that she would be willing to live with you in any way other than marriage?</t4782>
<t4783>Elizabeth replied, her eyes filled with tears:</t4783>
<t4784>- It seems, and this is the most astonishing thing, that the conscience of an elder sister regarding propriety and morality should consider herself doubtful.</t4784> <t4785>But, truly, I don't know what to say.</t4785> <t4786>Perhaps I am not being fair to my sister.</t4786> <t4787>But she is still too young; she has never been taught how to think about serious matters; for the past six months, no, for the past twelve months, she has cared for nothing but fun and frivolity.</t4787> <t4788>She has been allowed to spend her time in the laziest and most frivolous manner, and to follow every opinion she has picked up.</t4788> <t4789>Since the regiment arrived at Meryton, her mind has been filled with love, amusement, and the officers.</t4789> <t4790>She has done everything in her power to think and talk about this subject, to create – what should I call it?</t4790> <t4791>To create a sensitivity in her mind, a mind naturally quite lively.</t4791> <t4792>And we all know Wickham has all the appearances and words to captivate a woman.</t4792>
<t4793>Auntie said:</t4793>
<t4794>- But don't you see that Jane doesn't think too badly of Wickham, so she doesn't believe he is capable of doing such a thing?</t4794>
<t4795>- Does Jane think ill of anyone?</t4795> <t4796>And does she believe that anyone is capable, regardless of their character, until there is proof?</t4796> <t4797>But like you, Jane knows what Wickham's true nature is.</t4797> <t4798>We both know he has been dissolute in every sense of the word.</t4798> <t4799>He has no integrity or honor.</t4799> <t4800>He likes deceit and deception.</t4800>
<t4801>Mrs. Gardiner exclaimed, surprised at how she gathered information:</t4801>
<t4802>- And you really know all these things?</t4802><t4803>?</t4803>
<t4804>Elizabeth blushed:</t4804>
<t4805>- I really know.</t4805> <t4806>The other day I told my aunt about his scandalous behavior towards Mr. Darcy; it was my aunt who, during her last visit to Longbourn, heard him speak about Mr. Darcy, who had treated him with tolerance and generosity.</t4806> <t4807>And there are other instances that I cannot... instances not worth mentioning; but he has continuously lied about the Pemberley family.</t4807> <t4808>From what he said about Miss Darcy, I thought she was a proud, fastidious, and unpleasant girl.</t4808> <t4809>Yet he knew the opposite was true.</t4809> <t4810>He must have known that she is as sweet and humble as we have seen.</t4810>
<t4811>- But Lydia didn't know anything at all?</t4811> <t4812>Could it be that she doesn't know what you and Jane seem to understand so well?</t4812>
<t4813>- Yes, exactly like that! And this is the worst part.</t4813> <t4814>I myself was not clear about the truth until I went to Kent and met Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam.</t4814> <t4815>When I returned home, the regiment was preparing to leave Meryton in a week or two.</t4815> <t4816>Because of this, both Jane and I thought it unnecessary to make it public, as what good would it do to disrupt everyone's positive impression of him?</t4816> <t4817>And even when the family agreed to let Lydia go with Mrs. Forster, I never thought it necessary to enlighten her about his character.</t4817> <t4818>I never suspected she could be deceived.</t4818> <t4819>I did not foresee such consequences, while you could have easily thought of them.</t4819>
<t4820>- So, you think there's no reason for you to believe that when they went to Brighton, they had feelings for each other, right?</t4820>
<t4821>- I don't see any reason at all.</t4821> <t4822>I don't remember seeing any signs of affection between the two.</t4822> <t4823>When he first joined the militia, she already liked him, but so did all of us.</t4823> <t4824>Every girl in Meryton and around there was infatuated with him for the first two months, but he never treated her with any special attention.</t4824> <t4825>Therefore, after the phase of crazy infatuation, she no longer liked him, and since others in the regiment treated her more specially, she liked them more.</t4825>
<t4826>Even though there wasn't much new to add to the worries, hopes, and speculations, no one could dismiss these thoughts for long throughout the journey.</t4826> <t4827>Elizabeth's mind was always preoccupied.</t4827> <t4828>Tormented by all the distress and self-blame, she never felt comfortable or temporarily forgot the incident.</t4828>
<t4829>The three people moved as quickly as possible, and after spending the night on the road, they arrived back at Longbourn by dinner time the next day.</t4829> <t4830>Elizabeth was reassured that Jane must not have been anxious due to the long wait.</t4830>
<t4831>The Gardiner children were standing on the doorstep when they drove in, and as the car reached the threshold, the children's faces lit up, jumping excitedly to greet them.</t4831>
<t4832>Elizabeth jumped down from the carriage, quickly kissed each child, and ran into the front hall while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were busy with their children and Jane was running down the stairs from their parents' room.</t4832>
<t4833>Elizabeth affectionately hugged her sister, tears streaming down but not wasting a moment.</t4833> <t4834>She asked if there was any news of the two who had run away.</t4834> <t4835>Jane replied:</t4835>
<t4836>- Not yet.</t4836> <t4837>But now that you are here, I hope everything will be fine.</t4837>
<t4838>- Has Dad gone to the city</t4838><t4839>?</t4839>
<t4840>- Yes, he left on Tuesday as you mentioned in the letter.</t4840>
<t4841>- And have you heard from Dad often?</t4841>
<t4842>- The family only received news once.</t4842> <t4843>Dad wrote a few lines to my sister on Wednesday, saying that he had arrived safely.</t4843> <t4844>He only added that he would not send any more letters unless there was important news.</t4844>
<t4845>- And mother, how is she?</t4845> <t4846>How is the whole family?</t4846>
<t4847>- Mother is enduring quite well, I believe; although her spirit is in crisis.</t4847> <t4848>She is lying upstairs, and will be very happy to see everyone again.</t4848> <t4849>Mary and Kitty, thank God, are both normal.</t4849>
<t4850>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t4850>
<t4851>- But what about you, how are you?</t4851> <t4852>You look pale.</t4852> <t4853>You've had to go through so much suffering?</t4853>
<t4854>But the older sister reassured that she was completely healthy, their conversation was interrupted when the uncle and aunt entered.</t4854> <t4855>Jane ran to them, greeted and thanked them with smiles mixed with tears.</t4855>
<t4856>When everyone had entered the living room, the couple repeated the same questions as Elizabeth, and found that Jane had no news.</t4856> <t4857>However, the optimistic hope from her gentle heart remained; she still hoped that everything would end well, and each morning she expected to receive a letter, either from Lydia or from her father, to explain what the two had done and perhaps to announce a wedding.</t4857>
<t4858>After a few minutes of conversation, they went together to Mrs. Bennet's room.</t4858> <t4859>She received them in the manner they had anticipated, with tears and lamentations, insults to Wickham's character, and complaints about the suffering and mistreatment she was enduring.</t4859> <t4860>She blamed everyone while the less knowledgeable had indulged the faults of the daughter who should have blamed herself.</t4860> <t4861>She said:</t4861>
<t4862>- If everyone had listened to my opinion and all gone to Brighton, this wouldn't have happened; but poor little Lydia had no one to look after her.</t4862> <t4863>Why didn't the Forsters take care of her?</t4863> <t4864>I'm sure they were negligent or something, because the girl wouldn't have done such a thing if she had been properly cared for.</t4864> <t4865>I've always thought they weren't capable of looking after the girl, but no one ever listens to me, as always.</t4865> <t4866>Poor little girl!</t4866> <t4867>And now Mr. Bennet is away, I know he will confront Wickham wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what will become of all of us?</t4867> <t4868>The Collinses will throw us out before his grave is even green, dear brother, if you are not kind to us, I don't know how we will survive.</t4868>
<t4869>They all refuted such terrible opinions; Mr. Gardiner reassured her about his feelings for her and for her entire family, then he told her he planned to go to London the next day, and would try to help Mr. Bennet in every way to find Lydia.</t4869> <t4870>He added:</t4870>
<t4871>- Please don't panic as it won't do any good; although we should prepare for the worst-case scenario, we shouldn't think that it will definitely happen like that.</t4871> <t4872>The two people left Brighton less than a week ago.</t4872> <t4873>In the next few days, we hope to receive some news about them, and since we don't know if they have married or intend to marry, we shouldn't think that all is lost.</t4873> <t4874>When I get to the city, I will immediately go see my brother and invite him to go with me to Gracechurch Street, then we will discuss together what to do.</t4874>
<t4875>Mrs. Bennet replied:</t4875>
<t4876>- Oh! My dear brother, this is exactly what I long for.</t4876> <t4877>And please, when you get to the city and find them, wherever they may be, if they are not yet married, help advise them to get married.</t4877> <t4878>Regarding the wedding dress, tell them not to wait, but please tell Lydia she will have the money she wants to shop after the wedding.</t4878> <t4879>Above all, keep Mr. Bennet away from any conflicts.</t4879> <t4880>Tell him about my miserable state – that I am so terrified I can't think straight, I am trembling, speaking incoherently, having spasms on both sides, headaches, rapid heartbeat, to the point that I cannot rest day or night.</t4880> <t4881>Please tell Lydia not to rush into buying clothes before seeing me again, as she doesn't know where to buy at a cheap price.</t4881> <t4882>Oh, my dear brother, you are so kind!</t4882> <t4883>I know you will take care of everything.</t4883>
<t4884>But Mr. Gardiner, despite reassuring three more times that he would try, still wanted to advise her to remain calm in both hope and fear.</t4884> <t4885>They tried to console her in this way until dinner time, then they left her to pour out all her thoughts to the housekeeper who came to take care of her while the daughters had their meal.</t4885>
<t4886>Even though the younger brother and sister-in-law believed there was no reason to isolate her from the family like that, they did not object because they knew she was not careful enough to keep her mouth shut with the servants when they served at the table. So it was better to have only one servant, the most trusted one, who knew about all her tears and worries regarding the matter.</t4886>
<t4887>Mary and Kitty came to dine together after being busy in their respective rooms, one occupied with books, the other preoccupied with makeup.</t4887> <t4888>However, both appeared quite calm, with no noticeable changes, except that Kitty seemed more irritable than usual, due to the loss of her beloved younger sibling and the anger she had caused within the family.</t4888> <t4889>As for Mary, she had matured enough to whisper to Elizabeth with a serious expression.</t4889>
<t4890>- This is the most unfortunate event, and it will probably be talked about the most.</t4890> <t4891>But we must strive to overcome malice, and pour into each wounded heart the comfort of sisterly love.</t4891>
<t4892>Then, noticing that Elizabeth had no intention of replying, she added:</t4892>
<t4893>- Although the event was unfortunate for Lydia, we can draw a useful lesson from it, which is: a single misstep can cause immense ruin, reputation is as fragile as beauty, and maintaining propriety in one's attitude towards ordinary boys cannot be overemphasized.</t4893>
<t4894>Elizabeth looked up in astonishment, but her mind was too heavy for her to respond.</t4894> <t4895>However, Mary continued to console herself with quotes from books on ethics.</t4895>
<t4896>In the afternoon, the two eldest Bennet sisters had some time to sit alone together, and Elizabeth immediately inquired about many things, with Jane willing to respond amidst lamentations about the dreadful consequences of the affair.</t4896> <t4897>Elizabeth asked:</t4897>
<t4898>- But please tell me all the details that I haven't heard yet.</t4898> <t4899>What did Colonel Forster say?</t4899> <t4900>Did they notice any signs before the two ran away?</t4900> <t4901>They must have seen the two of them always together?</t4901>
<t4902>- Colonel Forster said he suspected the two had feelings for each other, especially on Lydia's part, but didn't see anything to worry about.</t4902> <t4903>She felt sorry for him.</t4903> <t4904>His attitude was very attentive and kind.</t4904> <t4905>He was coming here to express his concerns before he knew they weren't going to Scotland.</t4905> <t4906>As soon as he got the news, he hurried on his way.</t4906>
<t4907>- And does Danny firmly believe that Wickham will refuse to get married?</t4907> <t4908>Does he know anything about the two eloping? Did Colonel Forster meet Danny?</t4908>
<t4909>- Yes, but when he was questioned by him, he said he didn't know anything about their plan and didn't give any opinion on the matter.</t4909> <t4910>He didn't repeat what he believed, that they wouldn't get married, and from this, she hoped he had previously misunderstood.</t4910>
<t4911>- Do you think that before Colonel Forster came here, no one in the family suspected that they would actually get married, right?</t4911>
<t4912>- How could such a thought have entered our minds! She felt a little worried – a little fearful about the happiness of the girl in her marriage with him, because she knew his character was not always proper.</t4912> <t4913>Both father and mother knew nothing about this; they only thought that the marriage was too hasty.</t4913> <t4914>Then, with the pride of knowing more than others, Kitty revealed that in Lydia's last letter, the girl had prepared her sister for this matter.</t4914> <t4915>It seemed that Kitty had known for weeks that they had feelings for each other.</t4915>
<t4916>- But not from before they went to Brighton, right?</t4916>
<t4917>- That's right.</t4917>
<t4918>- And it seems that Colonel Forster himself had a poor opinion of Wickham, didn't he?</t4918> <t4919>Did he know Wickham's true nature?</t4919>
<t4920>- You must admit that he doesn't speak about Wickham as favorably as he did before.</t4920> <t4921>Since this unfortunate incident occurred, it is said that he has many debts in Meryton, but I hope this is not true.</t4921>
<t4922>- Oh, Jane, if we hadn't been so secretive, if we had told everyone what we knew about him, this wouldn't have happened!</t4922>
<t4923>- Maybe it would be better.</t4923> <t4924>But exposing someone's past mistakes without knowing their current state of mind seems unfair.</t4924> <t4925>We acted with the best intentions.</t4925>
<t4926>- Did Colonel Forster mention anything about the contents of Lydia's letter to his wife?</t4926>
<t4927>- You brought that letter here for the household to read.</t4927>
<t4928>Then Jane took out the letter and handed it to Elizabeth.</t4928> <t4929>The content of the letter was as follows:</t4929>
<t4930>"Dear Harriet,</t4930>
<t4931>You will laugh when you know that I am about to leave, and I cannot help but laugh when I think of your surprise tomorrow morning, right after I am absent.</t4931> <t4932>I intend to go to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess who I am going with, I will think you are foolish, because there is only one person in the world whom I love, he is an angel.</t4932> <t4933>I will never be happy without him, so please do not worry about me.</t4933> <t4934>If you do not accept my departure, please do not inform Longbourn about this, because I want to give them a bigger surprise when I write to them and sign as Lydia Wickham.</t4934> <t4935>What a joke! I will probably laugh so hard that I cannot write.</t4935> <t4936>Please apologize to Mr. Pratt for me, tell him I will be very happy to dance with him at the first ball I see him again.</t4936> <t4937>I will ask for my clothes to be sent to me when I get to Longbourn; but please tell Sally to mend the tear in the muslin dress before sending it.</t4937> <t4938>Goodbye.</t4938> <t4939>Please send my regards to Colonel Forster, I hope you will drink to my journey.</t4939>
<t4940>Grandma's little friend.</t4940>
<t4941>Lydia Bennet</t4941>
<t4942>Elizabeth exclaimed after reading the letter:</t4942>
<t4943>- Oh! Foolish, that foolish Lydia! What kind of letter is this, written at this time.</t4943> <t4944>But at least it shows that she was serious about the purpose of the trip.</t4944> <t4945>Even if he later persuaded her in some other way, for her part, it was not a disgraceful intention.</t4945> <t4946>Poor father! I wonder what he was thinking!</t4946>
<t4947>- She had never seen anyone so shocked.</t4947> <t4948>After reading the letter, he couldn't speak for a long time.</t4948> <t4949>Mother fell ill immediately, and the whole family was in confusion.</t4949>
<t4950>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t4950>
<t4951>- Oh! Jane, did any of the servants know about this matter right after the first day?</t4951>
<t4952>- I'm not sure, I hope no one knows.</t4952> <t4953>But during that time, it was very difficult to keep it a secret.</t4953> <t4954>My mother was in a panic, and although I tried to take care of her as best as I could, I'm afraid I didn't do as much as I wanted!</t4954> <t4955>But just thinking about the terrible things that could happen made me lose all my spirit.</t4955>
<t4956>- Taking care of mom has already been too much for you.</t4956> <t4957>You don't look well.</t4957> <t4958>Oh! If I had been with you then, I could have shared all the hardships and worries with you.</t4958>
<t4959>- Mary and Kitty are very good and I believe they can share, but I don't want them to.</t4959> <t4960>Kitty is somewhat weak and sensitive, while Mary has to study a lot, so I don't want her rest time to be interrupted.</t4960> <t4961>Aunt Philips came to our house on Tuesday, after father had left, and kindly offered to stay with me until Thursday.</t4961> <t4962>She has helped a lot and has been a valuable source of comfort for us.</t4962> <t4963>Lady Lucas is also very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to comfort everyone and expressed her willingness to send one of her daughters to help if we need.</t4963>
<t4964>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t4964>
<t4965>- You shouldn't have come; maybe you had good intentions, but in such unfortunate circumstances, one cannot think too highly of neighbors.</t4965> <t4966>Support is impossible; consolation is unbearable.</t4966> <t4967>Let them triumph from afar, and be satisfied.</t4967>
<t4968>Then she inquired about the measures that the father intended to take, when in London, to find his daughter.</t4968> <t4969>Jane replied:</t4969>
<t4970>- She thinks he intends to go to Epsom, where the two exchanged horses, observe the route, and try to track from there.</t4970> <t4971>His main purpose is to find the whereabouts of the small carriage that took them to Clapham.</t4971> <t4972>It carried a passenger from London, because he thinks the case of a young man and a girl getting off this carriage and then getting on another might attract attention, so he intends to inquire at Clapham.</t4972> <t4973>If he can find the address where the carriage dropped off the passenger, he will inquire there, hoping to find the whereabouts of the carriage.</t4973> <t4974>She is not sure what else he will do, because he left too hurriedly and was too agitated, so finding out this much was already very difficult.</t4974>
<t4975>Chapter 48</t4975>
<t4976>The whole family was expecting a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the postman arrived without bringing a single line from him.</t4976> <t4977>The entire family knew he was forgetful or lazy about correspondence in ordinary circumstances, but in this case, they hoped he would quickly send news home.</t4977> <t4978>Therefore, they concluded that he had no exciting news to write, but even about this, they still wanted to be sure.</t4978> <t4979>Mr. Gardiner only waited for the postman before setting off.</t4979>
<t4980>When he had gone, they felt certain they would at least receive regular news about what was happening.</t4980> <t4981>Their uncle had promised to persuade Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as possible.</t4981> <t4982>Mrs. Bennet felt much more at ease, as she believed this was the only way to save her husband from death in a fatal duel.</t4982>
<t4983>Mrs. Gardiner and her children stayed in Hertfordshire for a few more days, thinking that her presence might help the nieces.</t4983> <t4984>She took turns taking care of Mrs. Bennet and helping the nieces feel comfortable during their free hours.</t4984> <t4985>The other aunt also visited them frequently and always, as she said, with the purpose of boosting their spirits.</t4985> <t4986>However, each time she came, she would recount additional instances of Wickham's extravagance or irregularities, so whenever she left, she often made them feel even more disheartened.</t4986>
<t4987>Everyone in Meryton seemed to despise the man who was almost an angel to them just three months ago.</t4987> <t4988>They gossiped that he owed every merchant here; and his shady actions, all under the guise of charming women, extended to every family of the merchants.</t4988> <t4989>Each person considered him the most depraved young man in the world, and each began to realize that they had never truly believed in his handsome appearance before.</t4989> <t4990>Although she believed less than half of what was said about him, Elizabeth still believed he would ruin her sister's life.</t4990> <t4991>Even Jane, who believed the rumors even less, felt almost hopeless, especially since if the two had gone to Scotland, this was the time they should have received news of them, and she still hoped the two had gone to Scotland to get married.</t4991>
<t4992>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday.</t4992> <t4993>On Tuesday, his wife received a letter from him, stating that he had immediately found Mr. Bennet and persuaded him to go to Gracechurch Street. The letter also mentioned that Mr. Bennet had gone to Epsom and Clapham but had not obtained any satisfactory information; and that Mr. Bennet was currently inquiring at all the main hotels in the city, thinking they might have stayed at one of those places during their initial time in London before finding a residence.</t4993> <t4994>Mr. Gardiner did not believe they could find the two people this way, but he still assisted Mr. Bennet.</t4994> <t4995>He added that Mr. Bennet seemed completely unwilling to leave London and promised to write again as soon as possible.</t4995> <t4996>He also wrote an additional note at the bottom of the letter:</t4996>
<t4997>"I have written to Colonel Forster to ask him, if possible, to inquire among his friends in the regiment about any relatives or acquaintances who might know where he is hiding.</t4997> <t4998>If there is such a person who provides information, they could help us a lot.</t4998> <t4999>At the moment, the two of us have no leads to guide the search.</t4999> <t5000>I am sure Colonel Forster will do everything within his power to help us.</t5000> <t5001>However, I think perhaps Lizzy might be able to tell us more about his acquaintances than anyone else."</t5001>
<t5002>Elizabeth was not surprised to understand why they thought she could help in such a way, but she had no satisfactory information.</t5002> <t5003>She had never heard him mention his relatives, except for his father and mother; both had passed away many years ago.</t5003> <t5004>However, some of his friends in the militia might have some additional information, and although she did not have much hope in this, she thought it was still worth a try.</t5004>
<t5005>Each day at Longbourn now is a day of anxiety, but the most anxious time is the hour when the mail arrives.</t5005> <t5006>They are all restless waiting for the mail to be delivered.</t5006> <t5007>Through the letters, they will learn news whether good or bad, and each following day brings hope for new important news.</t5007>
<t5008>But before they received further news from Mr. Gardiner, a letter was sent to the father from Mr. Collins.</t5008> <t5009>Jane had been instructed by her father to open his letters when he was away, so she read it, and Elizabeth, out of curiosity, read it with her.</t5009>
<t5010>"Sir,</t5010>
<t5011>Due to the relationship between us and my position in society, I feel compelled to send you my condolences for the suffering you are enduring, which we were informed of yesterday through a letter sent from Hertfordshire.</t5011> <t5012>Sir, please believe that Mrs. Collins and I sincerely sympathize with you and your esteemed family for the sorrow that must now be of the most bitter kind, as it stems from a cause that time cannot erase.</t5012> <t5013>No words from me can alleviate such severe misfortune; nor can they console you, given the situation that everyone perceives as most distressing for the spirit of a parent.</t5013> <t5014>Your daughter's death might have been a blessing compared to this circumstance.</t5014> <t5015>And there is further cause for lamentation, as Charlotte informs me, there is reason to believe that your daughter's waywardness is due to erroneous indulgence, although, to console you and Mrs. Bennet, I believe it is due to her inherently bad nature, otherwise she would not have committed such a grave offense at such a young age.</t5015>
<t5016>No matter what, he deserves to be pitied in his suffering, and not only does Mrs. Collins agree with this, but also Lady Catherine and her daughter, who were informed by me about the incident.</t5016> <t5017>They agree with me in the concern that the misconduct of one daughter will harm the fortunes of everyone else, for those who will be associated with such a family, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly remarked.</t5017> <t5018>And this thought makes me all the more glad to recall an event last November, because if it had turned out differently, I would have been involved in all his troubles and disgrace.</t5018> <t5019>So, sir, I ask you to try to console yourself by completely casting out the unworthy daughter from your affections, leaving her to bear the consequences of her heinous wrongdoing.</t5019>
<t5020>Respectfully yours</t5020>
<t5021>Mr. Gardiner did not send any more letters until he received a reply from Colonel Forster, and then he had no bright news.</t5021> <t5022>They could not find any relative of Wickham who kept in touch with him, and it was certain that he did not live near any living relatives.</t5022> <t5023>Therefore, there was no one to provide information about him.</t5023> <t5024>And in his messy financial state, there was an additional strong incentive for him to hide his whereabouts besides the fear of Lydia’s relatives finding him, as it was discovered that he had left behind large gambling debts.</t5024> <t5025>Colonel Forster believed that it would take a thousand pounds to settle his expenses in Brighton.</t5025> <t5026>He owed a lot in the city, but his debts of honor were even higher.</t5026> <t5027>Mr. Gardiner did not want to hide these details from the Longbourn family.</t5027> <t5028>Jane heard the news with a sense of horror.</t5028> <t5029>She exclaimed: “A scoundrel!</t5029> <t5030>This is completely unexpected. I had no idea at all.”</t5030>
<t5031>Mr. Gardiner added in the letter that their father might return the next day, Saturday.</t5031> <t5032>Disappointed that all efforts had been unsuccessful, their father had agreed with his brother-in-law's suggestion that he should return to the family and leave everything to his brother-in-law to continue the search, depending on the situation.</t5032> <t5033>When Mrs. Bennet was informed, she did not appear as pleased as her children, even though she had been worried about his safety.</t5033> <t5034>She exclaimed:</t5034>
<t5035>- What is this, he returned without poor Lydia! He shouldn't leave London without finding the two of them.</t5035> <t5036>Who will deal with Wickham and force him to marry the girl if he comes back?</t5036>
<t5037>Because Mrs. Gardiner expressed a desire to return home, everyone agreed that she and her children should set off at the same time Mr. Bennet returned.</t5037> <t5038>In this way, the carriage would take her away and bring the master back to Longbourn.</t5038>
<t5039>Mrs. Gardiner went home with all sorts of puzzling thoughts about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend, who had intentionally sought her out.</t5039> <t5040>Her niece had not mentioned him, and although Mrs. Gardiner had been expecting a letter from him, they had received nothing.</t5040> <t5041>Since returning home, Elizabeth had not received any letters from Pemberley.</t5041>
<t5042>The current unfortunate state of the family makes any explanation for her mental decline unnecessary, so no one can speculate about this, although Elizabeth, now aware of her own feelings, believes that if she knew nothing about Mr. Darcy, she would have endured Lydia's disgrace better.</t5042> <t5043>She thought this might help her avoid one or two sleepless nights.</t5043>
<t5044>When Mr. Bennet returned home, he had his usual calm demeanor.</t5044> <t5045>He was as taciturn as ever, not mentioning the matter that had caused him to leave, and it was only after some time that his daughters had the courage to ask him about it.</t5045>
<t5046>In the afternoon, when he had tea with his children, Elizabeth started the conversation, and then, when she expressed concern about his endurance, he replied:</t5046>
<t5047>- Don't say anything about this.</t5047> <t5048>Who suffers if not Dad? This is caused by Dad, he has to feel that.</t5048>
<t5049>Elizabeth replied:</t5049>
<t5050>- Dad shouldn't be too hard on himself.</t5050>
<t5051>- You can warn your father about such disasters.</t5051> <t5052>Human nature is easily susceptible to them!</t5052> <t5053>No, Lizzy, at least once in my life, let me feel guilty on my own; I am not afraid of this feeling.</t5053> <t5054>It will soon pass.</t5054>
<t5055>- Dad, do you think the two people are currently in London?</t5055>
<t5056>- Yes, can they hide so discreetly anywhere else?</t5056>
<t5057>Kitty added:</t5057>
<t5058>- And Lydia had once expressed a desire to go to London.</t5058>
<t5059>The father replied, with difficulty:</t5059>
<t5060>- Then it will be happy, and its place to live there will probably be long-lasting.</t5060>
<t5061>After a moment of silence, he continued:</t5061>
<t5062>- Lizzy, I don't have any bad thoughts about you because you were right when you advised me last May.</t5062> <t5063>With this incident, your advice shows that your thinking is quite good.</t5063>
<t5064>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to get some tea for her mother.</t5064> <t5065>He exclaimed:</t5065>
<t5066>- This is a parade, it's fine, creating such an elegant character for unfortunate fate.</t5066> <t5067>One day, Dad will do the same; he will sit in the reading room, wearing a warm hat and pajamas, and cause more trouble, or perhaps he will wait until Kitty runs away from home.</t5067>
<t5068>Kitty said, miserably:</t5068>
<t5069>- I will not run away from home, papa.</t5069> <t5070>If I do go to Brighton, I will behave better than Lydia.</t5070>
<t5071>- You're going to Brighton! I wouldn't dare let you near East Bourn, even if I were to bet fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I've finally learned to be cautious, and you will see the consequences of this.</t5071> <t5072>No officer is allowed to step into this house anymore, not even to pass through the village.</t5072> <t5073>All dances are forbidden, except for you to dance with one of your sisters.</t5073> <t5074>And you will never step outside the door unless you can prove that you have been of good character for ten minutes each day.</t5074>
<t5075>Kitty thought all these warnings were serious.</t5075> <t5076>She began to cry.</t5076> <t5077>The father said:</t5077>
<t5078>- Alright, alright, don't pretend to be miserable. If in the next ten years you prove that you are a good girl, I will reconsider for you.</t5078>
<t5079>Chapter 49</t5079>
<t5080>Two days after Mr. Bennet returned, when Jane and Elizabeth were walking together behind the house, they saw a maid coming towards them, and thinking she was calling them to see their mother, they approached her.</t5080> <t5081>But she said to Miss Bennet:</t5081>
<t5082>- I'm sorry for interrupting, but I hope you have good news from the city, so I took the liberty to come and ask.</t5082>
<t5083>- What are you saying, Hill? We haven't heard anything from the city.</t5083>
<t5084>Mrs. Hill exclaimed, astonished:</t5084>
<t5085>- Miss, don't you know?</t5085> <t5086>You have an urgent letter sent by Mr. Gardiner to the master.</t5086> <t5087>The letter arrived half an hour ago.</t5087>
<t5088>The two girls dashed off, too eager to say anything more.</t5088> <t5089>They ran through the front hall into the breakfast room and through the reading room, but they couldn't find their father, and they were about to run up the stairs when they encountered the butler.</t5089> <t5090>He said:</t5090>
<t5091>- If you two are looking for the boss, he is heading towards the orchard.</t5091>
<t5092>They immediately ran back through the hall and across the lawn, seeing their father heading towards the small grove.</t5092> <t5093>Jane lacked endurance and gradually fell behind, while Elizabeth ran to their father, gasping for breath:</t5093>
<t5094>- Hey, dad, any news? What news? Did you receive a letter from your son?</t5094>
<t5095>- Yes, Dad received the urgent letter.</t5095>
<t5096>- Ah, what does the letter say?</t5096> <t5097>Good or bad?</t5097>
<t5098>The father took the letter out of his pocket:</t5098>
<t5099>- What good news could there be to expect? But maybe you still want to read it.</t5099>
<t5100>Elizabeth hurriedly snatched the letter from his hand.</t5100> <t5101>By this time, Jane had arrived.</t5101> <t5102>The father said:</t5102>
<t5103>- Read it out loud, because I don't quite understand what the letter is trying to say.</t5103>
<t5104>"Gracechurch Street, Monday"</t5104>
<t5105>August 2</t5105>
<t5106>Dear brother,</t5106>
<t5107>Finally, I can send you some news about my niece, and in general, I hope this news will make you happy.</t5107> <t5108>After you left on Saturday, I was fortunate to find out where the two of them were staying in London.</t5108> <t5109>I will tell you the details when we meet again.</t5109> <t5110>Just know that I have met the two of them."</t5110>
<t5111>Jane exclaimed:</t5111>
<t5112>- That's right, just as you hoped, they got married.</t5112>
<t5113>Elizabeth continued reading:</t5113>
<t5114>“I have met both of them.</t5114> <t5115>They are not married to each other; I do not see that they have such intentions, but if you approve of the arrangements that I have made on your behalf, I hope they will soon be married to each other.</t5115> <t5116>All that is required of you is to assure your daughter an inheritance of five thousand pounds after you and your wife have passed away, and furthermore, during your lifetime, to provide her with an allowance of one hundred pounds per year.</t5116> <t5117>In all respects, these are conditions that I do not hesitate to agree to on your behalf, if you permit.</t5117> <t5118>I am sending this letter urgently to avoid any delay in receiving your response.</t5118> <t5119>From these circumstances, you can easily see that Mr. Wickham's situation is not as desperate as we thought.</t5119> <t5120>People have been mistaken about this, and I am pleased to say that he still has a little money, even after settling his debts, to provide for my niece, in addition to her own property.</t5120> <t5121>If I deem it necessary in this case, and you grant me full authority to act on your behalf throughout this matter, I will immediately instruct Haggerton to prepare the payment.</t5121> <t5122>There is no reason for you to return to the city, but rather to remain calmly at Longbourn and let me handle everything for you.</t5122> <t5123>Please give me your response as soon as possible, and write down everything clearly.</t5123> <t5124>I think it is best that my niece's wedding takes place from my house, and I hope you will agree to this.</t5124> <t5125>She will arrive here today.</t5125> <t5126>I will write to you again as soon as further arrangements are made.</t5126>
<t5127>Respectfully.</t5127>
<t5128>Edw.</t5128> <t5129>Gardiner</t5129>
<t5130>Elizabeth exclaimed, when she finished reading the letter:</t5130>
<t5131>- Is that even possible!</t5131> <t5132>Could he really agree to marry that girl?</t5132>
<t5133>The older sister said:</t5133>
<t5134>- Then Wickham is not as bad as we thought.</t5134> <t5135>Dear father, I congratulate you.</t5135>
<t5136>Elizabeth replied:</t5136>
<t5137>- And has Dad replied to this letter yet?</t5137>
<t5138>- Not yet, but you must answer immediately.</t5138>
<t5139>Elizabeth earnestly implored her father not to waste much time.</t5139> <t5140>She exclaimed:</t5140>
<t5141>- Oh, dear father, go back inside and write a reply immediately.</t5141> <t5142>Father, consider how crucial this moment is in this situation.</t5142>
<t5143>Jane said:</t5143>
<t5144>- Let me write it for you, Dad, if you don't want the hassle.</t5144>
<t5145>He replied:</t5145>
<t5146>- Dad doesn't want to at all, but he will have to write.</t5146>
<t5147>Then he turned back and walked home.</t5147>
<t5148>Elizabeth asked:</t5148>
<t5149>- And may I ask this question?</t5149> <t5150>I think we have to agree to the conditions.</t5150>
<t5151>- Agreed! Dad just feels ashamed because he demands too little.</t5151>
<t5152>- And they have to get married! Yet he truly is a person!</t5152>
<t5153>- Yes, yes, they must get married.</t5153> <t5154>There is no other way.</t5154> <t5155>But there are two things I really want to know: the first thing is, how much money did your uncle spend to arrange this, and the second thing is, how can I repay him.</t5155>
<t5156>Jane exclaimed:</t5156>
<t5157>- Money! Your uncle! What do you mean, Dad?</t5157>
<t5158>- Dad means that no one, like him, would want to marry Lydia just because he is tempted by one hundred pounds a year while Dad is still alive, and five thousand pounds after that.</t5158>
<t5159>Elizabeth said:</t5159>
<t5160>- That's right, although I didn't think of this.</t5160> <t5161>All his debts have been paid off, and there's even a little money left! Oh, this is arranged by your son!</t5161> <t5162>A generous, kind person, I'm afraid he has to suffer losses.</t5162> <t5163>A small amount of money can't do all this.</t5163>
<t5164>- That's right.</t5164> <t5165>Wickham is a fool if he agrees to marry the girl for less than ten thousand pounds.</t5165> <t5166>Father regrets having to think badly of him when his relationship with the family has just begun.</t5166>
<t5167>- Ten thousand pounds!</t5167> <t5168>My God! How can one repay even half of such an amount?</t5168>
<t5169>Mr. Bennet did not reply, and each person, lost in their own thoughts, walked back home.</t5169> <t5170>The father went into the study to write a reply letter, while the two girls went into the breakfast room.</t5170>
<t5171>Elizabeth exclaimed, when only the two sisters were left alone:</t5171>
<t5172>- And they are really going to get married! How strange!</t5172> <t5173>And we will be happy about this.</t5173> <t5174>We must be happy because they are getting married, no matter how slim their chances of happiness are, no matter how bad his character is.</t5174> <t5175>Oh, Lydia!</t5175>
<t5176>Jane replied:</t5176>
<t5177>- She took comfort in thinking that he certainly wouldn't marry Lydia if he didn't truly love the girl.</t5177> <t5178>Although our kind uncle did something to untangle things for him, she didn't believe ten thousand pounds, or something like that, had been spent.</t5178> <t5179>Our uncle had children, and could have more.</t5179> <t5180>How could he possibly spend even half of the ten thousand pounds?</t5180>
<t5181>Elizabeth said:</t5181>
<t5182>- If we can find out about Wickham's debts and how much the payment is, we can know exactly how much Mr. Gardiner had to spend, because Wickham doesn't have a penny to his name.</t5182> <t5183>We can never repay the kindness of our uncle and aunt adequately.</t5183> <t5184>The fact that they took Lydia into their home and cared for her is a huge sacrifice that many years of gratitude cannot fully acknowledge.</t5184> <t5185>At this moment, the girl is already at their house! If this kindness does not make her feel remorseful now, she will never deserve happiness!</t5185> <t5186>I wonder how the meeting will go when she first sees our aunt!</t5186>
<t5187>Jane said:</t5187>
<t5188>- We must try to forget what happened to both sides.</t5188> <t5189>I hope and believe that the two of you will be happy.</t5189> <t5190>I think his willingness to marry the girl is proof that he has thought things through properly.</t5190> <t5191>The love between the two of them will help them stay steadfast, and I am satisfied to see them settling into a quiet and proper life; over time, their past impulsiveness will be overlooked.</t5191>
<t5192>Elizabeth replied:</t5192>
<t5193>- Their behavior was so terrible that you, or I, or anyone else, cannot forget it.</t5193> <t5194>There is no use in talking about this.</t5194>
<t5195>Now the two sisters realized that their mother still didn't know anything about what had happened.</t5195> <t5196>They went to the study and asked their father if he wanted them to inform their mother.</t5196> <t5197>The father, busy writing, did not look up and only replied:</t5197>
<t5198>- Up to you.</t5198>
<t5199>- Can we read your letter to mom?</t5199>
<t5200>- Do anything you want, and go outside.</t5200>
<t5201>Elizabeth took the letter placed on her father's writing desk, and they went upstairs together.</t5201> <t5202>Both Mary and Kitty were sitting in Mrs. Bennet's room, so it was only necessary to inform everyone once.</t5202> <t5203>Jane opened the letter to read.</t5203> <t5204>Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself.</t5204> <t5205>As soon as Jane read the part where Mr. Gardiner hoped Lydia would soon be married, she burst into joy, and each subsequent sentence added to her happiness.</t5205> <t5206>Knowing that her daughter would be married – that was all she needed.</t5206> <t5207>She did not worry whether her daughter would be happy, nor did she feel ashamed recalling her daughter's misdeeds.</t5207> <t5208>She exclaimed:</t5208>
<t5209>- Oh my dear Lydia, my beloved daughter! This is such wonderful news!</t5209> <t5210>My little girl is getting married! I will see her again! She will be married at sixteen! And my kind, good brother! I knew how this would turn out – I knew he would take care of everything.</t5210> <t5211>I am so eager to see my little girl again! And to see dear Wickham too! But what about the outfits, the wedding outfits!</t5211> <t5212>I will write to Mrs. Gardiner about this.</t5212> <t5213>Lizzy, run down and find your father, ask him how much he will give your sister.</t5213> <t5214>Stay, stay here, I will go ask him.</t5214> <t5215>Kitty, ring the bell for Mrs. Hill. I will change my outfit.</t5215> <t5216>Lydia, my dear! How happy we will all be to see each other again!</t5216>
<t5217>The eldest daughter tried to curb her mother's intense pleasure by directing her thoughts to the family's gratitude for Mr. Gardiner's kindness.</t5217> <t5218>She added:</t5218>
<t5219>- We need to acknowledge that the good outcome is largely due to his kindness.</t5219> <t5220>We are certain he promised to support Mr. Wickham financially.</t5220>
<t5221>The mother exclaimed:</t5221>
<t5222>- Ah, that's great! If it's not you, who else would do this?</t5222> <t5223>Do you know, if he didn't have a family, your mother and you would receive all his money, and this is the first time our family has received anything from him, not counting a few gifts before.</t5223> <t5224>Ah, I feel so happy.</t5224> <t5225>Soon, I will have a daughter getting married.</t5225> <t5226>Mrs. Wickham! Sounds delightful.</t5226> <t5227>And she's only just turned sixteen.</t5227> <t5228>Last June.</t5228> <t5229>Jane, I'm too excited to write; I'll dictate and you write for me.</t5229> <t5230>Later we will discuss money matters with your father; but we should order the necessary items right away.</t5230>
<t5231>Then she went into detail about the fabric samples for making clothes, and might have read a long list of items to buy if Jane hadn't persuaded her, though with some difficulty, that she should wait to consult her father.</t5231> <t5232>Jane said that a delay of one day wouldn't matter, and her mother, being so overjoyed, was not as stubborn as usual.</t5232> <t5233>Other plans began to creep into her mind.</t5233> <t5234>She said:</t5234>
<t5235>- I will go to Meryton as soon as I finish getting ready, to inform your Aunt Philips of the good news.</t5235> <t5236>And on the way back, I will stop by Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.</t5236> <t5237>Kitty, run down and tell them to prepare the carriage.</t5237> <t5238>I think a little fresh air will do me good.</t5238> <t5239>Children, do you want me to buy anything in Meryton? Oh, look! Mrs. Hill has arrived.</t5239> <t5240>Mrs. Hill, have you heard the good news?</t5240> <t5241>Miss Lydia is getting married, and you will get to drink to your heart's content to celebrate her wedding day.</t5241>
<t5242>Mrs. Hill immediately expressed her joy.</t5242> <t5243>Elizabeth, along with the others, also received her congratulations, and then, weary of this lively affair, she returned to her room so she could think freely.</t5243>
<t5244>The plight of poor little Lydia was bad, to put it mildly, but it couldn't get any worse, she should be glad.</t5244> <t5245>She felt this, although when thinking about the future, she couldn't expect her sister to be moderately happy or materially well-off; when thinking about what they had feared just two hours ago, she felt all the advantages they had just gained.</t5245>
<t5246>Chapter 50</t5246>
<t5247>In the past, Mr. Bennet had often wished that instead of spending all his income, he would save a portion each year to later provide for his children and his wife, should she outlive him.</t5247> <t5248>Now he wished for this more than ever.</t5248> <t5249>If he had fulfilled his duty in this way, Lydia would not have to be indebted to her uncle for having to buy any honor or reputation for her.</t5249> <t5250>Thus, the satisfaction of having persuaded one of the most worthless men in England to marry his daughter might have been rightly placed.</t5250>
<t5251>He seriously worried about his brother-in-law having to bear the costs, and he intended, if possible, to find out the amount his brother-in-law had supported, so that he could repay the debt as soon as possible.</t5251>
<t5252>When Mr. Bennet had just gotten married, the couple did not need to think about frugality because, of course, they would have a son, they believed so.</t5252> <t5253>This son would inherit the estate as soon as he came of age, and the widowed mother and the sisters would be provided for from this inheritance.</t5253> <t5254>The five daughters were born one after another without a son, while Mrs. Bennet, many years after giving birth to Lydia, still believed she would have a son.</t5254> <t5255>Eventually, this became hopeless, but it was too late to save up.</t5255> <t5256>Mrs. Bennet was not frugal and her husband liked to be free and easy, so for this reason alone they could not prevent overspending their income.</t5256>
<t5257>The marriage terms specified a sum of five thousand pounds for Mrs. Bennet and the children.</t5257> <t5258>But how this sum would be divided depended on the will of both Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.</t5258> <t5259>Now it was necessary to settle the inheritance finances, at least for Lydia, and Mr. Bennet did not hesitate to meet the immediate demands placed before him.</t5259> <t5260>Accompanied by sincere words of gratitude for his brother-in-law's kindness, though concisely expressed, he wrote down his complete approval of all the arrangements made, confirming that he would meet the demands placed upon him.</t5260> <t5261>Previously, he had never thought that persuading Wickham to marry his daughter would be so inexpensive for him under the current arrangement.</t5261> <t5262>By providing an annual allowance of one hundred pounds for his daughter, he would only spend about ten pounds a year, because with the living expenses and pocket money plus the amounts given by her mother, all the costs for his daughter were now almost equal to that allowance.</t5262>
<t5263>He was also pleased to see that he didn't have to put much effort into such arrangements, as his main desire now was to be disturbed as little as possible.</t5263> <t5264>When the initial fierce words that prompted him to search for his daughter had subsided, he naturally reverted to his lazy habits.</t5264> <t5265>The letter was quickly sent, because although he was slow to start a task, he often finished it swiftly.</t5265> <t5266>In the letter, he earnestly wanted to know how much he owed his brother-in-law, but he was too angry with Lydia to write anything to her.</t5266>
<t5267>The good news spread quickly within the house, and just as quickly in the surrounding area.</t5267> <t5268>The neighbors added a bit of serious philosophy.</t5268> <t5269>Conversations would certainly be more interesting if Lydia Bennet had fallen into the mire of society, or in a more favorable way, if she were isolated from the public, confined in a remote rustic house.</t5269> <t5270>But there was still much to discuss about her wedding; and the kind wishes for her well-being, which every spiteful old lady in Meryton had previously expressed, remained similar in this changed circumstance, as people thought that with such a husband, she would surely suffer.</t5270>
<t5271>It has been two weeks since Mrs. Bennet recovered from her illness and came downstairs to join the household, but on this happy day, she was once again sitting at the head of the dining table, her spirits suddenly uplifted.</t5271> <t5272>There was no thought of shame to dampen her triumphant feelings.</t5272> <t5273>Having a daughter get married was one of her earliest wishes since Jane turned sixteen, and now it was about to come true.</t5273> <t5274>Her thoughts and words always revolved around grand wedding ceremonies, fine fabrics, new carriages, and servants.</t5274> <t5275>She was busily searching the area for a house for her daughter, and without considering the family's income, she had rejected many houses of moderate size and appearance.</t5275> <t5276>She said:</t5276>
<t5277>- Haye-Park would be acceptable if the Gouldings would move, or the big house at Stoke would do if the drawing-room were larger, but Ashworth is too far away!</t5277> <t5278>I could not bear it if it lived ten miles away from me, and Purvis Lodge with its upper floor is dreadfully dull.</t5278>
<t5279>The husband let his wife speak without interruption when there were servants around.</t5279> <t5280>But when they withdrew, he said to her:</t5280>
<t5281>- Mrs. Bennet, before you choose any house, or all the houses for your son-in-law and daughter, we need to understand each other properly.</t5281> <t5282>They will never set foot in a house in this area.</t5282> <t5283>I will not encourage the recklessness of the others by receiving them at Longbourn.</t5283>
<t5284>Two people argued with each other after his statement, but Mr. Bennet remained steadfast, and soon the argument shifted to another topic.</t5284> <t5285>Mrs. Bennet felt surprised and horrified to learn that her husband would not spend a penny on clothing for his daughter.</t5285> <t5286>He also declared that on the wedding day, he would not show any sign of affection towards his daughter.</t5286> <t5287>Mrs. Bennet could hardly understand.</t5287> <t5288>She could not comprehend how his anger could lead to such unimaginable resentment, to the point of not wanting to grant his daughter a favor, making the wedding seem hardly legitimate.</t5288> <t5289>She was more worried that her daughter would be humiliated by the lack of new clothes at the wedding than feeling ashamed of her running away and living with Wickham, just two weeks before the wedding was to take place.</t5289>
<t5290>Elizabeth now regretted that in a moment of sorrow she had revealed to Mr. Darcy the family's fears regarding her youngest sister; for with her sister's wedding bringing a proper conclusion to the elopement, the family could hope to conceal the initial scandal from those living far away.</t5290>
<t5291>She was not afraid that Mr. Darcy would spread the news of the incident further.</t5291> <t5292>There were few people she could trust more regarding discretion; but at the same time, there was no one else whose knowledge of her sister's susceptibility would cause her such humiliation.</t5292> <t5293>However, this was not a fear of personal disadvantage, as there was already an insurmountable chasm between them.</t5293> <t5294>Even if Lydia's wedding were conducted with the utmost honor, it was not to be thought that Mr. Darcy would wish to associate with her family, as there was an additional obstacle: his justified disdain for a person he had rightly despised.</t5294>
<t5295>From such a relationship, she had no doubt that he would withdraw.</t5295> <t5296>The desire to win her affection, as she had clearly seen in Derbyshire, could not survive such a disaster.</t5296> <t5297>She felt inferior, she felt sorrowful, she felt regretful, although she was not sure about what.</t5297> <t5298>She envied his respectable status, when she no longer had any hope of benefiting from it.</t5298> <t5299>She wanted to receive news of him, when it seemed there was the least chance of hearing from him.</t5299> <t5300>She believed she could be happy with him when they might never meet again.</t5300>
<t5301>She often thought, it would indeed be a victory for him if he knew that now she could accept the feelings she had proudly rejected just four months ago!</t5301> <t5302>She still believed he had the most generous nature of any man.</t5302> <t5303>But because he was only human, he could still feel intoxicated by the triumph.</t5303>
<t5304>Now she began to realize that he was the person most suited to her, in terms of temperament and talent.</t5304> <t5305>His understanding and character, although different from hers, met all her desires.</t5305> <t5306>This was a mutually beneficial combination: through her simplicity and liveliness, his character could become more gentle, his behavior more measured; while from his maturity and knowledge, she could learn many more important things.</t5306>
<t5307>But such a happy marriage cannot teach people what true marital happiness really is.</t5307> <t5308>The combination of one distinct personality, and the rejection of the other personality, will soon occur in their family.</t5308>
<t5309>She could not imagine how Wickham and Lydia would manage to support themselves even relatively independently.</t5309> <t5310>But she could easily guess how short-lived their happiness would be for a couple brought together by infatuation rather than by virtue.</t5310>
<t5311>Mr. Gardiner had written another letter to his brother-in-law.</t5311> <t5312>With Mr. Bennet's words of thanks, he only replied briefly to affirm his earnest desire to bring happiness to any member of the family and asked Mr. Bennet not to mention gratitude anymore.</t5312> <t5313>The purpose of his letter was to inform the family that Mr. Wickham had decided to resign from the militia.</t5313> <t5314>He added:</t5314>
<t5315>"I earnestly hope that he should proceed with this matter as soon as he has decided on the wedding.</t5315> <t5316>And I think you will agree with me that this is the right thing to do, considering his circumstances and my niece's.</t5316> <t5317>Mr. Wickham intends to join the regular army, among his old friends there are still some who are capable and willing to help him enlist.</t5317> <t5318>He has been promised assistance by an officer in a regiment currently stationed in the North.</t5318> <t5319>There is an advantage to him serving in a unit stationed so far away, I hope that when they live with others, they will become more cautious, in a place where each person still retains some good qualities.</t5319> <t5320>I have written to Colonel Forster to inform him of our arrangements, and I have asked him to notify Mr. Wickham's creditors in Brighton and the surrounding area that the debts will be paid promptly, as I have committed myself.</t5320> <t5321>And please kindly inform his creditors in Meryton similarly, I enclose a list provided by him.</t5321> <t5322>He has declared all his debts; I hope at least he is not deceiving us.</t5322> <t5323>Haggerston has received my instructions, and everything will be settled within a week.</t5323> <t5324>Then the two will go to live with the regiment, except when they are invited to Longbourn.</t5324> <t5325>As I have learned from Mrs. Gardiner, my niece is very eager to see the whole family again before leaving the South. She is well and hopes you will kindly think of her.</t5325>
<t5326>Respectfully yours</t5326>
<t5327>E.</t5327> <t5328>Gardiner</t5328>
<t5329>Just like Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Bennet and his daughters clearly saw all the advantages when Mr. Wickham requested to leave the militia.</t5329> <t5330>But Mrs. Bennet was not very pleased.</t5330> <t5331>She was deeply disappointed to see Lydia having to settle in the North, just when she wished to have her close in happiness and pride.</t5331> <t5332>She had not yet given up the idea of having the two stay in Hertfordshire, and moreover, it was rather pitiful for Lydia to be separated from the militia regiment where she knew everyone and where she was fond of many people.</t5332> <t5333>She said:</t5333>
<t5334>- The little girl loves Mrs. Forster very much; it would be a shock if she had to be sent away!</t5334> <t5335>And there are a few young men that she is also very fond of.</t5335> <t5336>The officers in the new regiment might not be as pleasant.</t5336>
<t5337>Lydia's plea to be accepted back into the family before she went to the North initially met with a completely negative reaction.</t5337> <t5338>But Jane and Elizabeth thought about their sister's feelings and position.</t5338> <t5339>The two sisters earnestly pleaded with their father, both reasonably and emotionally, to accept the couple at Longbourn after their marriage.</t5339> <t5340>They hoped their father would think as they did and act as they wished.</t5340> <t5341>Their mother would be satisfied if she had the chance to show her neighbors that her daughter was married before she was sent to the North.</t5341> <t5342>Therefore, Mr. Bennet wrote to his brother-in-law that he allowed the couple to come, agreeing that immediately after the wedding, they should go straight to Longbourn.</t5342> <t5343>However, Elizabeth was surprised to learn that Wickham agreed to this plan.</t5343> <t5344>If she only considered her own feelings, she did not want to see him at all.</t5344>
<t5345>Chapter 51</t5345>
<t5346>The wedding day of their younger sister had arrived, and perhaps Jane and Elizabeth felt more for their sister than she felt for herself.</t5346> <t5347>The family sent a carriage to pick them up, and the two would arrive home by dinner time.</t5347> <t5348>The two older sisters, especially Jane, were terrified for their younger sister about the return journey of the two.</t5348> <t5349>Jane thought of Lydia through the emotions she attributed to herself, as if she were the guilty one, and thus she sorrowfully contemplated what her sister would have to endure.</t5349>
<t5350>Two people have arrived.</t5350> <t5351>The whole family gathered in the breakfast room to welcome them.</t5351> <t5352>Smiles adorned Mrs. Bennet's face as the carriage pulled up to the doorstep; her husband bore a serious expression, revealing nothing of his thoughts; the daughters, on the other hand, were anxious, restless, and uneasy.</t5352>
<t5353>The whole family heard Lydia's voice from the hall; the door was wide open, and she ran in.</t5353> <t5354>Her mother stepped forward, embraced her, excitedly welcoming her.</t5354> <t5355>She extended her hand to Wickham with a tender smile and wished them both happiness, in a lively tone that showed she believed they were happy.</t5355>
<t5356>The two turned towards Mr. Bennet, but his reception was not as warm as the mother's.</t5356> <t5357>His face showed a stern expression, and he scarcely parted his lips.</t5357> <t5358>In fact, their confident demeanor was enough to provoke him.</t5358> <t5359>Elizabeth felt disdain, even Miss Bennet was shocked.</t5359> <t5360>Lydia was still the same old Lydia; unruly, shameless, reckless, loud, and fearless.</t5360> <t5361>She looked from one sister to another, hoping they would congratulate her.</t5361> <t5362>When finally everyone sat down, she glanced around the room, noting a few small changes, and laughed loudly as she remarked that she had been away from this place for quite a while.</t5362>
<t5363>Wickham did not appear more distressed than she did.</t5363> <t5364>On the contrary, his demeanor was always pleasant, so much so that if his character and his wedding were as the family wished, his smiles and easy conversation when confirming their relationship would have pleased them.</t5364> <t5365>Elizabeth did not think he could be so brazen; but she sat down, resolute in her heart to never accept any shameless actions from a shameless person in the future.</t5365> <t5366>She blushed, Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two, though embarrassed in different ways, were equally red.</t5366>
<t5367>No one wants her to perform lengthy speeches.</t5367> <t5368>The bride and the mother could not speak any faster.</t5368> <t5369>Wickham unintentionally sat close to Elizabeth, starting to inquire about the people he knew in the area with a cheerful and relaxed attitude, which she could not match in her responses.</t5369> <t5370>It seemed as if everyone had the best memories in the world.</t5370> <t5371>Nothing was recalled in sorrow; and Lydia herself steered the conversation to the incident that the older sisters did not want to mention to the public.</t5371> <t5372>Lydia exclaimed:</t5372>
<t5373>- Just thinking about the past three months since you left, it feels like it's only been two weeks, yet so much has happened.</t5373> <t5374>My God! When you left, you had no thoughts of marriage until you returned!</t5374> <t5375>Although I would be really happy if that’s truly what you thought.</t5375>
<t5376>The father raised his eyes.</t5376> <t5377>Jane felt uneasy.</t5377> <t5378>Elizabeth looked at Lydia meaningfully, but her sister, who never listened to or looked at anything she didn't like, cheerfully continued:</t5378>
<t5379>- Oh, Ma-man!</t5379> <t5380>Do the people around here know that I got married today? I fear they don't, so when we passed by William Goulding's carriage, I lowered the window, took off my glove, and placed my hand on the window sill so he could see the wedding ring, then I bowed my head and smiled.</t5380>
<t5381>Elizabeth could not endure it any longer.</t5381> <t5382>She stood up, ran out of the room, and did not return until she heard them going to the dining room.</t5382> <t5383>She arrived just in time to see Lydia, with the intention of showing off, walk to her mother's right side and say to her eldest sister:</t5383>
<t5384>- Ah! Sister Jane, I now take your place and you have to move down, because now I am a married woman.</t5384>
<t5385>Do not assume that time would make Lydia embarrassed, so at first she was completely at ease.</t5385> <t5386>She became even more comfortable and cheerful.</t5386> <t5387>She expressed a desire to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucas family, and all the other neighbors, to hear each of them call her "Mrs. Wickham," and in the meantime, she showed Mrs. Hill and two other servants her ring and boasted to them that she was married.</t5387> <t5388>When they returned to the breakfast room, she said to her mother:</t5388>
<t5389>- Hey, ma-man, what do you think about my husband?</t5389> <t5390>Is he a likable person?</t5390> <t5391>I am sure my sisters are all jealous of me.</t5391> <t5392>I just wish they had half the luck I have.</t5392> <t5393>The sisters should go to Brighton.</t5393> <t5394>This is the place to find a husband.</t5394> <t5395>Ma-man, it's a pity that we all didn't go together.</t5395>
<t5396>- That's right, and if mother had the authority, all of us would have gone together.</t5396> <t5397>But dear Lydia, mother doesn't want you to go so far away.</t5397> <t5398>Is it necessary to go that far?</t5398>
<t5399>- Oh, my God, I have to go – it's nothing.</t5399> <t5400>I will be happy with everything.</t5400> <t5401>Mom and dad and the sisters should come visit us.</t5401> <t5402>We will spend the winter in Newcastle; I dare say there will be some balls, and I will find dance partners for everyone.</t5402>
<t5403>The mother said:</t5403>
<t5404>- Mom would like that more than anything else.</t5404>
<t5405>Elizabeth said:</t5405>
<t5406>- I appreciate your good intentions, but I particularly dislike the way you are looking for a husband for me.</t5406>
<t5407>The two people stayed for no more than ten days.</t5407> <t5408>Mr. Wickham had completed the enlistment procedures before he left London, and he needed to report to the regiment within two weeks.</t5408>
<t5409>Except for Mrs. Bennet, no one expressed regret that the two stayed for such a short time.</t5409> <t5410>She made the most of the time by taking her daughter to visit various people and often organizing gatherings at home.</t5410> <t5411>Everyone accepted these gatherings at home; the thought of avoiding family reunions was better than not thinking at all.</t5411>
<t5412>The feelings of Wickham towards Lydia were exactly as Elizabeth had thought: not as strong as Lydia's feelings for him.</t5412> <t5413>According to her own reasoning, she did not need to observe much to understand that the elopement was more due to her sister's love than his.</t5413> <t5414>She could have wondered why, if he did not love her sister much, he wanted to elope with her.</t5414> <t5415>This was simply because she believed that he surely needed to do so due to his dire circumstances, and if that were the case, he was not a young man who would pass up the opportunity to find himself a companion.</t5415>
<t5416>Lydia loved him dearly.</t5416> <t5417>In every circumstance, he was always her beloved Mr. Wickham; no one could take him away from her.</t5417> <t5418>He was everything good in the world, and she was certain that on the first day of September, he would shoot more birds than anyone else in the country.</t5418>
<t5419>One morning, not long after the two arrived, while Lydia was sitting and talking with her two older sisters, she said to Elizabeth:</t5419>
<t5420>- Lizzy, you have never told me about your wedding.</t5420> <t5421>When you talk to mom and others, I am not comfortable with it.</t5421> <t5422>Do you wonder how the event was organized?</t5422>
<t5423>Elizabeth replied:</t5423>
<t5424>- She is not exactly puzzled.</t5424> <t5425>She thinks that talking about the incident could go on forever.</t5425>
<t5426>- There, you are so strange! But I need to tell you.</t5426> <t5427>You know, we got married at St. Clement's Church because Wickham resided in that parish.</t5427> <t5428>And we decided to go there at eleven o'clock.</t5428> <t5429>My uncle, aunt, and I will go together, while the others will meet us at the church.</t5429> <t5430>And well, Monday morning came, I was so nervous!</t5430> <t5431>You know, I was very afraid that something might happen to cancel the wedding, and then I would be in a mess.</t5431> <t5432>And with my aunt here, I was getting dressed, she was pleading and talking incessantly as if she were preaching.</t5432> <t5433>However, I could only catch bits and pieces, because I was thinking about, you can guess, my dear Wickham.</t5433> <t5434>I wanted to know if he would wear the blue coat for the wedding ceremony or not.</t5434>
<t5435>"Ah, and then everyone had breakfast at ten o'clock as usual; I thought the meal would never end, because, by the way, you will know, my uncle and aunt are terribly unpleasant whenever they are near me.</t5435> <t5436>If you can believe me, I haven't stepped out the door in the entire two weeks I've been here.</t5436> <t5437>No gatherings, plans, or anything.</t5437> <t5438>London is actually quite dull, but there is a theater performing.</t5438> <t5439>Ah, and when a carriage came to the doorstep, my uncle was called away to do some work for that annoying Mr. Stone.</t5439> <t5440>And then, you know, whenever the two meet, they can't seem to part.</t5440> <t5441>Ah, I was so worried that I didn't know what to do, because my uncle was supposed to take me to the wedding, and if we were late, we couldn't get married.</t5441> <t5442>But, fortunately, ten minutes later he returned, and then everyone went together.</t5442> <t5443>However, I later remembered, if my uncle couldn't go, there was no need to postpone the wedding, because Mr. Darcy could help." </t5443>
<t5444>Elizabeth repeated, astonished:</t5444>
<t5445>- Mr. Darcy!</t5445>
<t5446>- Ah, that's right! He will come with Wickham, you know.</t5446> <t5447>But poor me! I forgot! I shouldn't have said a word about this.</t5447> <t5448>I had sincerely promised them.</t5448> <t5449>What will Wickham say?</t5449> <t5450>This is a secret!</t5450>
<t5451>Jane said:</t5451>
<t5452>- If it's a secret, don't say anything more.</t5452> <t5453>The two of us won't want to know more.</t5453>
<t5454>Elizabeth said, though restless with curiosity:</t5454>
<t5455>- Ah, that's right, you two won't ask anything.</t5455>
<t5456>Lydia said:</t5456>
<t5457>- Thank you both, because if you had asked, I would have certainly told you everything, and then Wickham would have been furious.</t5457>
<t5458>With such encouragement to ask questions, Elizabeth was forced to avoid it by running away.</t5458>
<t5459>But she found it difficult to live without knowing about such matters, or at least difficult not to want to find out.</t5459> <t5460>Mr. Darcy had attended her sister’s wedding.</t5460> <t5461>Clearly, it was precisely such a setting and precisely such people that he did not want to attend and did not want to meet.</t5461> <t5462>Speculations about the meaning of this arose wildly in her mind, but she was not satisfied with any of them.</t5462> <t5463>The speculation that pleased her the most, placing him in the highest regard, seemed impossible to be true.</t5463> <t5464>She could not bear such intense thoughts, so she hurriedly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote a short letter to her aunt to ask her to explain the matter Lydia had just brought up, to see if this matched the secretive nature they had identified.</t5464> <t5465>She added:</t5465>
<t5466>"You can immediately understand my eagerness to know how someone who has no relation to anyone in our family, a stranger to the family, could attend such a ceremony."</t5466> <t5467>"Please write back to me immediately and help me understand – except for the reason that Lydia thinks it necessary to keep it secret, after which I will be at ease and not want to know anything more."</t5467>
<t5468>She thought, upon finishing the letter: "Although you won't feel at ease, dear aunt, if you don't let me know in an honorable manner, I will certainly resort to tricks to find out."</t5468>
<t5469>Jane's delicate and honorable nature did not allow her to speak privately with Elizabeth about what Lydia had revealed.</t5469> <t5470>Elizabeth was pleased about this – until her inquiries were satisfactorily answered, she had to endure the situation without a confidant.</t5470>
<t5471>Chapter 52</t5471>
<t5472>Elizabeth was pleased to receive a reply to her letter as quickly as she had hoped.</t5472> <t5473>As soon as she received the letter, she hurried to a grove in the garden where she was least likely to be disturbed, sat on a bench, and prepared for the pleasure, as the letter looked quite long, indicating that there was no secrecy being kept from her.</t5473>
<t5474>"Gracechurch Street, September 6,</t5474>
<t5475>My dear niece/nephew,</t5475>
<t5476>Auntie just received your letter, and she spent the entire morning writing a reply, because she anticipated that if she wrote briefly, it wouldn't be enough to convey everything she wants to say to you.</t5476> <t5477>I must say that Auntie was surprised when she received your request; she didn't think such a request would come from you.</t5477> <t5478>However, don't think that Auntie is upset, because she just wants you to understand that she thinks you don't need to inquire in such a manner.</t5478> <t5479>If you don't want to understand Auntie, she apologizes for digressing.</t5479> <t5480>Your uncle was just as surprised as Auntie.</t5480> <t5481>He did those things only because he thought you were involved.</t5481> <t5482>But if you are truly unaware and innocent, Auntie needs to clarify further.</t5482>
<t5483>"On the very day you returned home from Longbourn, your uncle received an unexpected guest.</t5483> <t5484>Mr. Darcy came to visit, and the two talked for many hours.</t5484> <t5485>By the time you arrived, they had finished; therefore, your curiosity was not as tormenting as mine.</t5485> <t5486>Mr. Darcy came to inform Mr. Gardiner that he had found the place where your sister and Mr. Wickham were hiding, and he had met and talked with both of them, several times with Wickham, and once with Lydia.</t5486> <t5487>If I remember correctly, he left Derbyshire just one day after we returned, and went to the city with the determination to find them.</t5487> <t5488>He explained that his motivation in this was because he thought that due to him, not many people were aware of Wickham's true character, otherwise he could have prevented respectable young women from mistakenly falling in love with him.</t5488> <t5489>Mr. Darcy blamed his misplaced pride for the entire affair, confessing that he previously thought it beneath him to expose the private actions of the other man to everyone.</t5489> <t5490>Therefore, he felt it was his duty to act and try to rectify the mistake he had caused.</t5490> <t5491>If Mr. Darcy had any other motivation, I think it would not cause him any shame.</t5491>
<t5492>“He came to the city and within just a few days found two people, because he had some clues that we didn't have, and his awareness of this was another reason why he was determined to help you search.</t5492> <t5493>It seems there was a woman, Mrs. Younge, who was previously a governess for Miss Darcy, but was later dismissed for some reason that Mr. Darcy did not disclose.</t5493> <t5494>She moved to a large house on Edward Street, and since then has been living by renting out rooms.</t5494> <t5495>Mr. Darcy knew this woman was close to Wickham, so as soon as he arrived in the city, he went to find her to inquire.</t5495> <t5496>But it took one or two days for her to give him any information.</t5496> <t5497>I think this woman didn't want to betray Wickham's trust unless there was money involved, because she really knew where her friend was staying.</t5497> <t5498>In fact, Wickham went to find her as soon as the two of them arrived in London, and if she had the means to accommodate them, they would have stayed at her place.</t5498> <t5499>However, in the end, our kind friend Mr. Darcy managed to get the information.</t5499> <t5500>He went to meet Wickham, and then insisted on meeting Lydia.</t5500> <t5501>Mr. Darcy said his purpose was to persuade her to get out of the disgraceful situation, to return to her family as soon as they showed willingness to take her back and support her.</t5501> <t5502>But he found Lydia determined to stay where they were hiding.</t5502> <t5503>She didn't care about her family, she didn't want him to help her, she didn't want to hear about leaving Wickham.</t5503> <t5504>She was convinced that she and Wickham would get married someday, but didn't specify when that would be.</t5504>
<t5505>"Mr. Darcy thought that given her feelings, the only thing left to do was to expedite the wedding, although in his first conversation with Wickham, Mr. Darcy clearly saw that this was never in his intentions.</t5505> <t5506>Wickham only talked about resigning from the militia due to pressing debts of honor, without considering the negative consequences of Lydia's elopement, which were solely due to her own foolishness.</t5506> <t5507>He intended to resign as an officer immediately, and as for his future, he had no concrete plans.</t5507> <t5508>He had to go somewhere but did not know where, and he was well aware that he had no income to live on.</t5508> <t5509>Mr. Darcy asked him why he did not marry your sister right away.</t5509> <t5510>Although no one thought Mr. Bennet was wealthy, he could still do something for him, and his situation would improve thanks to the marriage.</t5510> <t5511>But from Wickham's response, Mr. Darcy realized that he still harbored hopes of securing a better fortune through marriage elsewhere.</t5511> <t5512>However, given the circumstances, he still wanted to quickly escape his current difficulties. The two met several times as there were many matters to discuss.</t5512> <t5513>Of course, Wickham wanted more than what he could receive, but in the end, the two reached a reasonable agreement.</t5513>
<t5514>"Everything was agreed upon by the two of them.</t5514> <t5515>Next, Mr. Darcy intended to explain his plan clearly to your uncle, and he went to Gracechurch Street one evening before your aunt returned home.</t5515> <t5516>But he did not meet Mr. Gardiner, and upon further inquiry, Mr. Darcy found out that your father was with him, but would be leaving the city the next morning.</t5516> <t5517>He thought your father was not someone he could consult as effectively as your uncle, so he waited until your father left before meeting your uncle.</t5517> <t5518>He did not leave his name, so until the next day, everyone only knew that a gentleman wanted to discuss business matters.</t5518> <t5519>He returned on Saturday.</t5519> <t5520>By then, your father had left, your uncle was at home, and as your aunt mentioned above, they talked for a long time.</t5520> <t5521>They met again on Sunday; that was when your aunt also met him.</t5521> <t5522>It wasn't until Monday that they agreed on everything, and immediately after, your uncle sent an urgent letter to Longbourn.</t5522>
<t5523>“But Mr. Darcy is very stubborn, Lizzy, I think this stubbornness is truly a flaw of Mr. Darcy.</t5523> <t5524>At different times, he must have been condemned for different faults, but this is the real flaw.</t5524> <t5525>Nothing can be done unless he takes charge himself, although I am sure your uncle is willing to take care of everything.</t5525> <t5526>They kept arguing with each other for a long time, longer than two young people deserve to be concerned about.</t5526> <t5527>But in the end, your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to act to help his niece, he only received credit for the arrangement.</t5527> <t5528>This goes against his nature, and I truly think your letter made him infinitely happy; this explanatory letter helped him remove the false mask of gratitude and place the benefactor in his rightful position.</t5528> <t5529>But, Lizzy, you should not reveal this to anyone, at most only to Jane.</t5529> <t5530>I think you already know quite well how they arranged things for the two young people.</t5530> <t5531>I believe the amount of money to cover his debts was more than a thousand pounds, plus another thousand pounds for her in addition to what she received from her family, and the cost for him to join the army.</t5531> <t5532>The reason why Mr. Darcy wanted to do all this, I mentioned above.</t5532> <t5533>Mr. Darcy thinks that because of him, due to his reserve and lack of prudent judgment, others did not understand Wickham's character, hence the incident occurred.</t5533> <t5534>There may be some truth in this, but I am not sure whether to blame his reserve or the reserve of anyone else.</t5534>
<t5535>“But despite having such a clever way of speaking, my dear Lizzy, you can rest assured that your uncle would never have conceded if he and your aunt did not believe that Mr. Darcy had another interest in arranging this matter.</t5535> <t5536>Once they had agreed on everything, he returned to his friends who were still staying at Pemberley, but they agreed that he would return to London once more on the wedding day, at which time all the financial matters would be settled.</t5536>
<t5537>"I think I have now told you everything clearly.</t5537> <t5538>The relationship you mentioned to me will surprise and delight you; I hope at least it does not bother you.</t5538> <t5539>Lydia is staying with us, and Wickham often visits.</t5539> <t5540>He is still the same person I understood him to be in Hertfordshire.</t5540> <t5541>As for Lydia, I wouldn't want to tell you that I am not very pleased with her attitude if I hadn't realized, through Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her behavior when visiting home would be the same, so now saying it won't cause you any more pain.</t5541> <t5542>I often speak to her in the most serious manner, showing her all the harm her actions have caused and all the suffering she has brought to the family.</t5542> <t5543>If she happens to hear what I say, it is by luck, because I am certain she does not listen.</t5543> <t5544>Sometimes I get annoyed, but I think of dear Jane and Elizabeth, and for their sake, I try to endure her.</t5544>
<t5545>“Mr. Darcy returned as promised, and as Lydia informed you, he attended the wedding.</t5545> <t5546>The next day, he dined with the family, and he will leave the city on Wednesday or Thursday.</t5546> <t5547>My dear, you may be very angry with me if I take this opportunity to say that I am very fond of him.</t5547> <t5548>In every aspect, his demeanor is as pleasant as when we were in Derbyshire.</t5548> <t5549>All his knowledge and opinions please me; he only lacks a bit of liveliness, but his wife could influence him in this regard, if he chooses his spouse carefully.</t5549> <t5550>I think he is quite reserved – he almost never mentions your name.</t5550> <t5551>But discretion seems to be a fashionable trait.</t5551> <t5552>Forgive me if I have any undue thoughts, or at least do not punish me by forbidding me from coming to P. I will never be satisfied until I have the opportunity to take a full tour around the garden.</t5552> <t5553>A four-wheeled carriage with a pair of small horses is sufficient.</t5553> <t5554>But I cannot write any more.</t5554> <t5555>My children have been clamoring for me for half an hour now.</t5555>
<t5556>Your aunt,</t5556>
<t5557>M.</t5557> <t5558>Gardiner</t5558>
<t5559>The content of the letter caused Elizabeth's mind to be agitated with chaotic thoughts, in which it was difficult to discern whether joy or pain was more dominant.</t5559><t5560>She had vague and confused speculations because she was unsure of what Mr. Darcy could have done with her sister's spouse, while she feared encouraging him to do something too good to be true.</t5560><t5561>And at the same time, she dreaded having to be fair and then painfully thinking he had not done so.</t5561><t5562>Now the speculations about the good deed had become too real!</t5562><t5563>He had determined to track down the two people in the city, he had endured all difficulties and hardships in such a search, then had to plead with a woman he hated and despised terribly.</t5563><t5564>He had to humble himself to meet a person he only wanted to avoid and whose name he did not want to mention, then had to meet this person repeatedly, reason with them, advise them, and finally spend money to bribe them.</t5564><t5565>He had done all these things for a young girl he neither loved nor respected.</t5565><t5566>Her heart whispered to her that he did all these things for her.</t5566><t5567>But her hope was suppressed by other thoughts.</t5567><t5568>She immediately thought that her vanity was still not enough to expect his feelings for her, for a woman who had once rejected him, now wanting him to overcome the natural disdain for a connection with Wickham.</t5568><t5569>Wickham's brother-in-law! Every form of pride must oppose such a relationship.</t5569><t5570>Surely he had helped a great deal.</t5570><t5571>She felt ashamed when she thought of how much he had helped.</t5571><t5572>But he had spoken about the reason for his intervention, and it was easy to see that this reason was legitimate.</t5572><t5573>It was right that he believed he had been wrong; he had every right to act and every condition to act.</t5573><t5574>Although she did not consider herself the main reason for his actions, perhaps she could believe that the remaining affection he had for her had supported his purpose to help her achieve peace of mind.</t5574><t5575>It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that those efforts were for someone who did not hope for any reciprocation.</t5575><t5576>Her family owed him for Lydia's restoration, for Lydia's dignity, for everything.</t5576><t5577>Oh! She was deeply grieved when she thought of every unkind thought she had harbored, every harsh word she had spoken to him.</t5577><t5578>She felt ashamed for herself, but proud of him.</t5578><t5579>Proud that in that goal of affection and honor, he had surpassed himself.</t5579><t5580>She read and reread the part where her aunt praised him.</t5580><t5581>Not much, but enough to make her happy.</t5581><t5582>She also felt joy, though mixed with regret, when she saw that both her aunt and uncle firmly believed that there was always genuine affection and trust between her and Darcy.</t5582>
<t5583>Someone came over, causing her to stand up and interrupting her train of thought.</t5583> <t5584>She intended to move to another place, but Wickham blocked her way.</t5584> <t5585>He said, as he approached her:</t5585>
<t5586>- Dear sister, I fear I have intruded upon your solitary walk, haven't I?</t5586>
<t5587>She replied with a smile:</t5587>
<t5588>- That's right, but it doesn't mean that I welcome any further intrusion into my privacy.</t5588>
<t5589>- If that's the case, I sincerely apologize.</t5589> <t5590>We have always been good friends, and now even more so.</t5590>
<t5591>- Yes.</t5591> <t5592>Did anyone else leave the house?</t5592>
<t5593>- I don't know.</t5593> <t5594>Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are getting into the carriage to go to Meryton.</t5594> <t5595>Dear sister, I heard your uncle and aunt say you went to see Pemberley.</t5595>
<t5596>She accepted.</t5596>
<t5597>- I am envious of you, but I believe this is too much for me; otherwise, I could have dropped by on my way to Newcastle.</t5597> <t5598>I guess you have met the old housekeeper, haven't you?</t5598> <t5599>Poor Reynolds, she always loved me.</t5599> <t5600>But of course, she didn't mention my name when talking to you.</t5600>
<t5601>- Actually, she did mention it.</t5601>
<t5602>- And what did she say?</t5602>
<t5603>- She said you had joined the military, and she feared it had not... not gone very well.</t5603> <t5604>With such a distance, you know, many things get misinterpreted.</t5604>
<t5605>He replied, biting his lip:</t5605>
<t5606>- That's right.</t5606>
<t5607>Elizabeth hoped she had shut the guy up, but he continued:</t5607>
<t5608>- I was surprised to meet Darcy again in the city this month.</t5608> <t5609>We ran into each other a few times.</t5609> <t5610>I wondered what he was doing there.</t5610>
<t5611>- Maybe he is preparing for Miss De Bourgh's wedding.</t5611> <t5612>There must be something special that requires him to go to the city at this time of year.</t5612>
<t5613>- Certainly.</t5613> <t5614>Did you meet him at Lambton?</t5614> <t5615>I heard from the Gardiners that you did.</t5615>
<t5616>- Yes, he introduced us to his sister.</t5616>
<t5617>- And do you like her?</t5617>
<t5618>- Very fond.</t5618>
<t5619>- Actually, I heard that she has gotten better in the past one or two years.</t5619> <t5620>When I last met her, she didn't seem to have much promise.</t5620> <t5621>I'm very glad to know you like her.</t5621> <t5622>I hope she will become a really good person.</t5622>
<t5623>- I'm sure she will be like that.</t5623> <t5624>She has gone through the most difficult age.</t5624>
<t5625>- Do you pass by the village of Kympton?</t5625>
<t5626>- I don't remember us passing through.</t5626>
<t5627>- I mention this region because it is the parish that I was supposed to take charge of.</t5627> <t5628>A truly beautiful area! The Parish Priest's Residence is wonderful!</t5628> <t5629>It suits me in every way.</t5629>
<t5630>- If you were a clergyman, would you enjoy preaching?</t5630>
<t5631>- I liked it a lot.</t5631> <t5632>I should have considered this as part of my duty, and soon it would have meant nothing to me.</t5632> <t5633>One should not be troubled..., but surely, this should have been meant for me! A peaceful, secluded setting for such a life would have matched my idea of happiness.</t5633> <t5634>But it was not to be.</t5634> <t5635>Did you ever hear Darcy mention this situation when you were in Kent?</t5635>
<t5636>- I heard from a knowledgeable person, whom I believe to be correct, that there are conditions set for you regarding this matter, depending on the person in charge of the property.</t5636>
<t5637>- She has heard.</t5637> <t5638>Yes, there are conditions set for that matter; I have told you about it, you probably remember.</t5638>
<t5639>- I heard that, at one time, you didn't like preaching as you do now, that in fact, you had declared you never wanted to be ordained, and all arrangements were made accordingly.</t5639>
<t5640>- She has heard!</t5640> <t5641>And it's not without foundation.</t5641> <t5642>You may remember I told you about this when we first talked about the case.</t5642>
<t5643>They approached the main door of the house, as she had walked quickly in hopes of getting rid of him.</t5643> <t5644>Thinking of her sister, she didn't want to anger him.</t5644> <t5645>She only replied, with a slightly wry smile:</t5645>
<t5646>- Hey, Mr. Wickham, we are brothers-in-law, you know.</t5646> <t5647>We should not argue about the past.</t5647> <t5648>In the future, I hope we always agree with each other.</t5648>
<t5649>She extended her hand.</t5649> <t5650>He kissed her hand with a fond, flattering gesture, but he didn't know how to express it; and the two of them stepped into the house.</t5650>
<t5651>Jane Austen</t5651>
<t5652>Pride and Prejudice</t5652>
<t5653>Translator: Diệp Minh Tâm</t5653>
<t5654>Chapter 53</t5654>
<t5655>Mr. Wickham was completely satisfied with this conversation, so much so that he never again felt the urge to provoke or upset his dear wife by bringing up old matters, and she was pleased to see that she had said enough to make him keep quiet.</t5655>
<t5656>The day Mr. Wickham and Lydia were to depart had arrived, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to accept the separation.</t5656> <t5657>While her husband did not agree to the plan of the whole family going to Newcastle, the separation could last at least twelve months.</t5657> <t5658>She exclaimed:</t5658>
<t5659>- Oh! My dear Lydia, when will we meet again?</t5659>
<t5660>- My Lord! I don't know.</t5660> <t5661>Maybe two or three years.</t5661>
<t5662>- My dear, remember to write letters to mom often.</t5662>
<t5663>- I will try.</t5663> <t5664>But you know, a married woman never has time to write letters.</t5664> <t5665>My sisters can write to you.</t5665> <t5666>They will have nothing else to do.</t5666>
<t5667>Mr. Wickham bid farewell with more affection than his wife.</t5667> <t5668>He smiled brightly, looked handsome, and said many nice things.</t5668>
<t5669>As soon as the two people had left the house, Mr. Bennet said:</t5669>
<t5670>- He is the man who has always been as good as I have ever seen.</t5670> <t5671>He is flashy, self-satisfied, and endears himself to all of us.</t5671> <t5672>I am extremely proud of him.</t5672> <t5673>I challenge even Sir William Lucas to see if he has such a fine son-in-law.</t5673>
<t5674>The loss of a daughter left Mrs. Bennet in a daze for many days.</t5674> <t5675>She said:</t5675>
<t5676>- I often think there is nothing sadder than being away from a loved one.</t5676> <t5677>It is truly lonely when there is no loved one by your side.</t5677>
<t5678>Elizabeth said:</t5678>
<t5679>- Mom, you see, it's the inevitable result of marrying off a daughter.</t5679> <t5680>You should feel happier when you think that there are still four unmarried daughters.</t5680>
<t5681>- It's not like that.</t5681> <t5682>Lydia is away from her mother not because she got married, but because her husband's regiment is stationed far away.</t5682> <t5683>If they were stationed closer, she wouldn't have to leave so soon.</t5683>
<t5684>But her unhappy situation was short-lived, and her mind again opened to a glimmer of hope.</t5684> <t5685>A new piece of news began to spread.</t5685> <t5686>The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the master's return within a day or two, to go hunting for a few weeks.</t5686> <t5687>Mrs. Bennet was quite anxious.</t5687> <t5688>She looked at Jane, smiled, and shook her head:</t5688>
<t5689>- Ah, ah, so Mr. Bingley is coming back, isn't he?</t5689> <t5690>Ah, that's good.</t5690> <t5691>But it's not like I care.</t5691> <t5692>You know, he means nothing to our family, and I certainly never want to see him again.</t5692> <t5693>But still, if he wants to, he is welcome at Netherfield.</t5693> <t5694>And who knows what might happen?</t5694> <t5695>But this means nothing to us.</t5695> <t5696>You know, dear, we agreed long ago never to speak a word about this.</t5696> <t5697>By the way, are you sure he's coming back?</t5697>
<t5698>The other person replied:</t5698>
<t5699>- You can believe it, because Mrs. Nicholls went to Meryton last night.</t5699> <t5700>I saw her passing by and went out to find out the truth; she told me that it was indeed true.</t5700> <t5701>At the latest, he will arrive on Thursday, but most likely on Wednesday. She said she was going to the butcher to buy some meat for Wednesday, and she had just bought three pairs of ducks at the right age for slaughtering.</t5701>
<t5702>Miss Bennet could not hear the news of his arrival without blushing.</t5702> <t5703>For many months, she had not mentioned his name when conversing with Elizabeth, but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:</t5703>
<t5704>- Lizzy, I saw you scrutinizing me when our aunt announced the news, and I know I appeared distressed.</t5704> <t5705>But don't think this is due to some foolish reason.</t5705> <t5706>I was just momentarily confused because I thought I would be scrutinized.</t5706> <t5707>I want you to believe that I am neither happy nor sad about this news.</t5707> <t5708>I am only glad about one thing, which is that we will see him less, because he will return alone.</t5708> <t5709>It's not that I fear for myself, but I am tired of people's comments.</t5709>
<t5710>Elizabeth did not know what to think about this.</t5710> <t5711>If she had not met him at Derbyshire, she might have thought he dared to come here for the reason he stated.</t5711> <t5712>But she still did not think he had feelings for Jane, and she was torn between two possibilities: he returned because his friend permitted it, or because he had enough courage to defy the opposition.</t5712>
<t5713>Sometimes she thought: "But it is strange that this poor guy cannot return to the house, where he is legally renting, without causing so much speculation like this!"</t5713> <t5714>“I will leave him be.”</t5714>
<t5715>Although her sister had declared this and sincerely believed it to be her own feelings, Elizabeth could easily see that her sister's spirit was being affected.</t5715> <t5716>Her sister was disturbed, unbalanced, more so than Elizabeth had ever seen before.</t5716>
<t5717>The topic had been discussed enthusiastically by the father and mother about twelve months ago, and now it was being brought up for discussion again.</t5717> <t5718>Mrs. Bennet said:</t5718>
<t5719>- Dear, as soon as Mr. Bingley arrives here, of course you will go visit him.</t5719>
<t5720>- No, no.</t5720> <t5721>She made me visit him last year, and promised that if I went, he would marry one of my daughters.</t5721> <t5722>But nothing happened, and I cannot be sent on the errands of a fool.</t5722>
<t5723>The wife explained to her husband that every polite neighborly man needed to show such concern when he returned to Netherfield. He replied:</t5723>
<t5724>- I hate this kind of social nicety.</t5724> <t5725>If he wants to associate with us, let him come find us.</t5725> <t5726>He knows where we are.</t5726> <t5727>I will not waste my time chasing after neighbors every time they return after leaving.</t5727>
<t5728>- Ah, I just know it would be truly impolite if you didn't go meet him.</t5728> <t5729>But this doesn't stop me from inviting him to dinner, I have decided.</t5729> <t5730>We will soon invite Mrs. Long and the Gouldings.</t5730> <t5731>With us as well, that makes thirteen people, so there will be a place for him at the table.</t5731>
<t5732>Comforted by this resolve, she felt more at ease with her husband's rudeness, although it was somewhat embarrassing to know that her neighboring families might see Mr. Bingley again before her own family had the chance.</t5732> <t5733>As the day of Mr. Bingley's return approached, Jane said to her sister:</t5733>
<t5734>- She began to feel sad that he would return.</t5734> <t5735>It was nothing at all; but she could not bear to hear this matter being discussed endlessly.</t5735> <t5736>Our mother was distressed by what she said.</t5736> <t5737>She could be at ease again when he no longer resided at Netherfield!</t5737>
<t5738>Elizabeth replied:</t5738>
<t5739>- I wish I could say something to comfort you, but it is completely beyond my ability.</t5739> <t5740>You must know this, and I can no longer be content to advise someone who is suffering to be patient, because you always have plenty of patience.</t5740>
<t5741>Mr. Bingley had returned.</t5741> <t5742>With the help of the servants, Mrs. Bennet devised ways to gather information as quickly as possible, to the extent that her time of anxiety and frustration was prolonged.</t5742> <t5743>She counted the days she would need to wait to send an invitation to him, and felt despair at the thought of wanting to see him sooner.</t5743> <t5744>But on the morning of the third day after he arrived in Hertfordshire, from the dressing room window, she saw him passing through the gate and approaching the house.</t5744>
<t5745>She called the girls to share her joy.</t5745> <t5746>Jane resolutely sat still, but Elizabeth wanted to please her.</t5746> <t5747>She walked to the window, looked outside, saw Mr. Darcy walking along, then returned to sit down beside her sister.</t5747>
<t5748>Kitty said:</t5748>
<t5749>- Mom, there is a man going with Mr. Bingley.</t5749> <t5750>Who is he?</t5750>
<t5751>- An acquaintance or something like that, my child, I guess; I'm sure I don't know.</t5751>
<t5752>- There! It looks like the guy who used to go with Mr. Bingley before.</t5752> <t5753>What was his name!</t5753> <t5754>The tall, proud one.</t5754>
<t5755>- Good heavens! Mr. Darcy! That's right. Well, we can welcome any friend of Mr. Bingley who comes here, otherwise mother would have to say she doesn't want to see him.</t5755>
<t5756>Jane looked at Elizabeth with astonishment and concern.</t5756> <t5757>She knew little about their meeting in Derbyshire, so she felt embarrassed for her sister now meeting him for the first time since receiving his explanatory letter.</t5757> <t5758>Both sisters were confused.</t5758> <t5759>Each worried about the other, while they did not hear their mother rambling on about her dislike for Mr. Darcy and her intention to be polite to him only because he was Mr. Bingley's friend.</t5759> <t5760>But Elizabeth had another reason for her confusion that Jane did not know, as she had not yet had the courage to show her sister Mrs. Gardiner's letter or to recount the changes in her feelings towards Mr. Darcy. To Jane, he was merely the man who had proposed to her sister and been rejected; but to her, he was the man to whom the whole family owed a debt, the man she cared about, if not as passionately as Jane did for Mr. Bingley, then at least as reasonably and justifiably.</t5760> <t5761>Her astonishment at seeing him come – coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her out again – was nearly equal to her astonishment at his changed demeanor in Derbyshire.</t5761>
<t5762>Her face turned pale for a moment, then became rosy again with a hint of blush, and a smile made her eyes sparkle even more as she thought of his feelings and wishes changing in Derbyshire.</t5762>
<t5763>She told herself: "First, let's see how he behaves, then there will still be time for wishes."</t5763>
<t5764>She sat attentively continuing the work she was doing, trying to stay calm, not daring to look up, until out of curiosity she looked at her sister's face, while a servant was approaching the room.</t5764> <t5765>Jane appeared slightly pale, but calmer than she thought.</t5765> <t5766>When the two men entered, her face turned even redder, however, she greeted them with a moderate calmness, showing no signs of anger or excessive warmth.</t5766>
<t5767>Elizabeth only spoke a few words to everyone as social etiquette required, then sat down to continue her unfinished work, with her usual unnecessary eagerness.</t5767> <t5768>She only glanced at Mr. Darcy once.</t5768> <t5769>He was as solemn as ever, and she thought, more solemn than when he first came to Hertfordshire rather than when she met him at Pemberley.</t5769> <t5770>But, perhaps with the presence of his mother, he could not be himself as he was when he faced his uncle and aunt.</t5770> <t5771>This was a painful speculation but not without basis.</t5771>
<t5772>She also glanced at Bingley for a moment; seeing him display both joy and confusion.</t5772> <t5773>Mrs. Bennet received him with polite manners, which embarrassed her two daughters, especially when she adopted a cold and formal demeanor while conversing with his friend.</t5773>
<t5774>Especially Elizabeth, because she knew her mother was grateful to Mr. Darcy for helping her beloved daughter avoid disgrace, felt sorrowful to the point of almost being in pain when she saw how clumsily her mother had shown favoritism.</t5774>
<t5775>Darcy inquired about Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, a question which she could not answer fluently, and then he did not ask much more.</t5775> <t5776>He did not sit next to her, perhaps this was the reason for his silence, but in Derbyshire, he had not been like that.</t5776> <t5777>There, he could converse with her relatives when he did not know what to say to her.</t5777> <t5778>But a few minutes passed and he still did not say anything.</t5778> <t5779>A few times, unable to restrain her curiosity, she glanced up at him, sometimes seeing him looking at Jane or at her, often looking down at the ground.</t5779> <t5780>Clearly, he appeared thoughtful and unwilling to make a good impression as he had when they last met.</t5780> <t5781>She felt disappointed, and angry with herself for feeling disappointed.</t5781>
<t5782>She thought: "I can wish for the opposite!"</t5782> <t5783>But why did he come here?</t5783>
<t5784>She had no spirit to converse with anyone except him, and not much courage to start a conversation with him.</t5784>
<t5785>She inquired about your sister, but didn't know what else to say.</t5785>
<t5786>Mrs. Bennet said:</t5786>
<t5787>- Mr. Bingley, you have been away for quite some time.</t5787>
<t5788>He agreed with her.</t5788>
<t5789>- I began to worry that you would never return.</t5789> <t5790>People said you intended to leave for good around the time of Saint Michael's Day, but I still hoped it wasn't true.</t5790> <t5791>Many changes have taken place in this area since you left. Miss Lucas got married and has settled down.</t5791> <t5792>And one of my daughters.</t5792> <t5793>I think you have heard; in fact, you might have read the news in the papers.</t5793> <t5794>The news was published in the Times and the Courier, I know, though not in the right manner.</t5794> <t5795>The notice only stated “George Wickham, with Miss Lydia Bennet,” without mentioning her father, or her place of residence, or anything like that.</t5795> <t5796>My brother-in-law Gardiner handled this; I don't understand how he could be so clumsy.</t5796> <t5797>Did you read the news?</t5797>
<t5798>- Mr. Bingley replied that he had read it and offered his congratulations.</t5798> <t5799>Elizabeth did not dare to look up, so she could not know Mr. Darcy's reaction.</t5799>
<t5800>The mother continued:</t5800>
<t5801>- It is truly joyful to see a daughter have a good marriage, but Mr. Bingley, at the same time, it is truly sad to see her have to live far from me.</t5801> <t5802>They are going to Newcastle, quite far to the North, and they will settle there, because I think you have heard about him leaving the militia to join the army.</t5802> <t5803>Thank God! He also has a few friends, though perhaps not many who are worthy of him.</t5803>
<t5804>Elizabeth understood that she was referring to Mr. Darcy, and she felt so miserable with embarrassment that she almost didn't want to sit back down.</t5804> <t5805>However, this made her try harder to continue the conversation, and she asked Bingley if he intended to stay here.</t5805> <t5806>He replied that he would stay for a few weeks.</t5806>
<t5807>The mother said:</t5807>
<t5808>- When you have shot all your birds, I invite you to come here and shoot as much as you like in Mr. Bennet's estate.</t5808> <t5809>I am sure he will be very happy to accommodate you and will provide every convenience for you.</t5809>
<t5810>Elizabeth felt even more miserable because of such unnecessary and intrusive concern! She thought that now, even if she had as many desires as she did a year ago, which had made them proud, everything would still quickly lead to a sorrowful end.</t5810> <t5811>At that moment, she felt that many years of happiness could not compensate for Jane or herself for those moments of such painful endings.</t5811>
<t5812>She whispered to herself: "The first desire of my heart is to never get close to either of these two people.</t5812> <t5813>Forming a relationship with them cannot create the joy that could soothe such restlessness.</t5813> <t5814>Please don't let me meet these two people again!"</t5814>
<t5815>However, the distress, which many years of happiness could not compensate for, was soon alleviated when she saw that her sister's beauty had rekindled the affection of her former lover.</t5815> <t5816>When he first entered, he only had a brief conversation with Jane, but gradually he paid more and more attention to her.</t5816> <t5817>He found her as pretty as the previous year, still gentle, still calm, though she spoke less than before.</t5817> <t5818>Jane deliberately acted as if there were no changes in her, believing that she was still as lively in conversation as she used to be.</t5818> <t5819>But her mind was always in turmoil, to the point that sometimes she didn't realize she was being silent.</t5819>
<t5820>When the two gentlemen stood up to leave, Mrs. Bennet remembered the courtesy she had planned, so she invited them to dinner in a few days.</t5820> <t5821>She added:</t5821>
<t5822>Mr. Bingley, you still owe us a visit, because when you went to the city last winter, you promised to attend a family dinner with us as soon as you returned.</t5822> <t5823>You see, I haven't forgotten, and please believe that I will be very disappointed if you do not come back and keep your promise.</t5823>
<t5824>Bingley looked a bit absent-minded with this recollection, and mentioned some concern, as he had to attend to business.</t5824> <t5825>Then they left.</t5825>
<t5826>Mrs. Bennet was very eager to keep them and invite them to dinner that very day, but although she always prepared a decent table, she thought there should be at least two main courses to befit a person for whom she had such ardent designs, or to satisfy the appetite and pride of a person with an income of ten thousand a year.</t5826>
<t5827>Chapter 54</t5827>
<t5828>As soon as they left, Elizabeth walked out of the room to regain her composure, or in other words, to reflect on the events that had further clouded her mind.</t5828> <t5829>Mr. Darcy's attitude surprised and annoyed her.</t5829>
<t5830>She thought: "If he comes only to remain silent, solemn, and aloof, then why come at all?"</t5830>
<t5831>She didn't find any explanation that made her happy.</t5831>
<t5832>”You are still charming, still able to win over your uncle and aunt when you are in the city, so why seek me out?</t5832> <t5833>If you no longer care about me, why remain silent?</t5833> <t5834>Teasing and teasing, this guy!</t5834> <t5835>I shouldn't think about him anymore.”</t5835>
<t5836>She could only maintain her intention for a moment, because her sister had approached with a cheerful demeanor, indicating that she was more pleased with the two guests than Elizabeth was.</t5836> <t5837>She said:</t5837>
<t5838>- Now that the first reunion is over, she feels completely relieved.</t5838> <t5839>She knows her own determination well, and she will never be flustered when he comes.</t5839> <t5840>She is happy that he accepted the invitation to dinner on Tuesday. At that time, everyone will see that they meet each other just like two ordinary and carefree acquaintances.</t5840>
<t5841>Elizabeth smiled and said:</t5841>
<t5842>- Yes, truly very carefree.</t5842> <t5843>Hey Jane, be cautious!</t5843>
<t5844>- Dear Lizzy, you should not think that I am so weak as to be in danger.</t5844>
<t5845>- I think there is a great risk that you will make him love you even more.</t5845>
<t5846>*</t5846>
<t5847>During the time until Tuesday, they did not see him again, and Mrs. Bennet was busy with all sorts of happy calculations, rekindled by Mr. Bingley's cheerful and polite demeanor during his half-hour visit.</t5847>
<t5848>On Tuesday, quite a few people were invited to Longbourn.</t5848> <t5849>The two young men, eagerly awaited, arrived on time like athletes.</t5849> <t5850>As they entered the dining room, Elizabeth anxiously observed whether Mr. Bingley would choose his usual seat next to her sister, as he had done in previous gatherings.</t5850> <t5851>The cautious mother, with the same thought in mind, patiently invited him to sit next to her.</t5851> <t5852>As he stepped in, he seemed hesitant, but Jane was looking around and smiling; thus, it was favorable.</t5852> <t5853>He sat down next to her.</t5853>
<t5854>Elizabeth felt triumphant and looked towards his friend.</t5854> <t5855>The gentleman displayed an air of indifference in a noble manner, and she would have thought he acknowledged that Bingley deserved happiness, if she had not seen his eyes also directed towards Mr. Darcy, with a look half anxious, half playful.</t5855>
<t5856>During the meal, Bingley's demeanor showed that he had feelings for Jane, though he was more reserved than before; but Elizabeth still believed that if he were allowed to be natural, their happiness would quickly become solid.</t5856> <t5857>Although she did not dare to be certain about the future outcome, she was still pleased when observing his attitude.</t5857> <t5858>This lifted her spirits, as she had no other joy.</t5858> <t5859>Mr. Darcy sat far from her, next to her mother.</t5859> <t5860>She knew that in such a situation, no one would be happy and no one would benefit.</t5860> <t5861>She did not hear what they exchanged with each other, but she saw that they conversed little, and when they did, each had a serious and cold demeanor.</t5861> <t5862>Her mother's rudeness made her even more pained when she remembered how much her family owed him.</t5862> <t5863>Sometimes she wished to do anything to let him know that not the entire family was unaware or ungrateful for his kindness.</t5863>
<t5864>She hoped that tonight she and he would have the opportunity to be close to each other, that they could talk more than just exchanging polite greetings when he first arrived.</t5864> <t5865>After the meal, while waiting for the young men to arrive, the time she spent anxiously and uneasily sitting in the living room dragged on in a tiring and tedious manner, to the point that it almost made her impolite.</t5865> <t5866>She longed for them to walk in, the decisive moment to determine whether she would have an enjoyable evening or not.</t5866>
<t5867>She told herself, "If he doesn't come to me, then I will ignore him."</t5867>
<t5868>The young men came over, and she thought he looked as if he had met all her expectations, but, alas! The ladies had surrounded the table where Miss Bennet was making tea and Elizabeth stood beside her pouring coffee into the cups, leaving no space beside her for a chair.</t5868> <t5869>As the men approached, one of the girls moved closer to her, whispering: “They cannot come between us, I am determined on that.</t5869> <t5870>We don't want them here, do we?”</t5870>
<t5871>Darcy separated himself, going to a corner of the room.</t5871> <t5872>She watched him, jealous of everyone he was talking to, almost losing patience to serve coffee to anyone, then angry with herself for acting ridiculous!</t5872>
<t5873>"A person who once refused!"</t5873> <t5874>How could I be so foolish as to expect him to confess his love again? Is there any man who would not reject the demeaning act of confessing love a second time to the same woman?</t5874> <t5875>According to their psychology, there is no humiliation more dreadful than that!”</t5875>
<t5876>However, she was a little excited when he returned his cup himself, and she seized this opportunity to ask him:</t5876>
<t5877>- Is your sister still staying at Pembley?</t5877>
<t5878>- Yes, she will stay there until Christmas.</t5878>
<t5879>- And lonely? Have all your friends gone home?</t5879>
<t5880>- Mrs. Annesley is staying with her.</t5880> <t5881>The others have gone to Scarborough for these three weeks.</t5881>
<t5882>She couldn't think of anything else to say, but if he wanted to talk to her, he could do better.</t5882> <t5883>But he stood by her for a moment in silence, and when the other girl whispered into Elizabeth's ear again, he walked away.</t5883>
<t5884>When the tea table was cleared, they laid out the card games, and the ladies all stood up. Elizabeth hoped to be near him again, but all her wishes were overturned when he fell into the greed of his mother, who wanted another player. After a while, he had to sit with them.</t5884> <t5885>Now she had lost hope for an enjoyable evening.</t5885> <t5886>The two were entangled at two different tables, and she no longer had any expectations, except for the occasional glance he cast in her direction, as if to ensure that neither he nor she could fully concentrate on the card games they were playing.</t5886>
<t5887>Mrs. Bennet intended to invite the two gentlemen to stay for a late meal, but unfortunately their carriage was called before the others, and she had no opportunity to keep them.</t5887>
<t5888>As soon as all the guests left, she said:</t5888>
<t5889>- My children, how do you find this evening?</t5889> <t5890>Mother thinks everything is very beautiful.</t5890> <t5891>The dining table is set exactly as Mother wanted.</t5891> <t5892>The venison is roasted perfectly, everyone says they've never seen such a plump leg of venison.</t5892> <t5893>The soup is ten times better than the soup we had at Lucas's house last week, even Mr. Darcy admitted that the grouse was very delicious, and Mother thinks he has at least two or three French chefs.</t5893> <t5894>And, dear Jane, Mother has never seen you as beautiful as today.</t5894> <t5895>Mrs. Long said the same, because Mother asked her how you looked.</t5895> <t5896>And what do you think she said? "Ah!</t5896> <t5897>Mrs. Bennet, at last we shall see her settled at Netherfield." That's what she said.</t5897> <t5898>Mother thinks Mrs. Long is really a good person - and her nieces behave quite well, and are not beautiful at all.</t5898> <t5899>Mother likes them very much.</t5899>
<t5900>Mrs. Bennet was completely elated.</t5900> <t5901>She had seen Bingley's demeanor towards Jane, enough to make her believe that in the end, she would win his affection.</t5901> <t5902>In her high spirits, her expectations far exceeded all reason, to the point where she was quite disappointed not to see him return the next day to propose.</t5902>
<t5903>Ms. Bennet said to Elizabeth:</t5903>
<t5904>- What a pleasant day.</t5904> <t5905>Mother chose the guests correctly; everyone gets along with each other.</t5905> <t5906>She hopes to see them often.</t5906>
<t5907>Elizabeth smiled.</t5907>
<t5908>- Lizzy, don't do that.</t5908> <t5909>You shouldn't doubt me, making me suffer. I want you to believe that now I have learned to take pleasure in conversing with a pleasant and reasonable person without any further expectations.</t5909> <t5910>I am completely satisfied with his current attitude, seeing that he never intended to win my affection.</t5910> <t5911>It's just that compared to anyone else, he becomes more gentle in speech and has a more positive attitude in trying to please others.</t5911>
<t5912>The younger sister replied:</t5912>
<t5913>- You are really cruel, you don't want me to laugh, and you keep trying to annoy me like that.</t5913>
<t5914>- In some cases, it is really difficult to get people to believe what you say.</t5914>
<t5915>- And in other cases, it is unbelievable!</t5915>
<t5916>- But why do you want to persuade me to feel more than what I have already said?</t5916>
<t5917>- This is a question I don't know how to answer.</t5917> <t5918>We all want to give advice, although we can only advise on things that are not worth knowing.</t5918> <t5919>Please forgive me, and if you insist on being distant, don't consider me your confidant anymore.</t5919>
<t5920>Chapter 55</t5920>
<t5921>A few days later, Mr. Bingley came again, and he came alone.</t5921> <t5922>His friend was busy going to London and would return in ten days.</t5922> <t5923>He sat and chatted with them for over an hour, in a cheerful spirit.</t5923> <t5924>Mrs. Bennet invited him to have dinner with the family, but with a concerned look, he confessed that he was busy elsewhere.</t5924>
<t5925>She said:</t5925>
<t5926>- When you come next time, I hope we will be luckier.</t5926>
<t5927>He said he would be very pleased to accept at any other time, and if she allowed, he would seize the earliest opportunity to come and converse with them.</t5927>
<t5928>- Can you come tomorrow?</t5928>
<t5929>Alright, he is not busy at all tomorrow and eagerly accepts her invitation.</t5929>
<t5930>He arrived, and arrived early, so early that the girls hadn't had time to dress properly.</t5930> <t5931>Mrs. Bennet rushed into her daughter's room, while she was still wearing her outer coat, her hair only half done.</t5931>
<t5932>- Hey Jane, hurry up so we can go downstairs in time.</t5932> <t5933>He has arrived, Mr. Bingley has arrived.</t5933> <t5934>He really has arrived.</t5934> <t5935>Hurry up, hurry up. Hey, Sarah, come here right away to help Miss Bennet with her dress.</t5935> <t5936>Don't worry about Lizzy's hair.</t5936>
<t5937>Jane said:</t5937>
<t5938>- We will come down right away, but I am sure Kitty is ready, as she went upstairs half an hour ago.</t5938>
<t5939>- Hmph, never mind Kitty!</t5939> <t5940>What does it have to do with anything! Hurry up, hurry up! Where's your shawl?</t5940>
<t5941>But the mother had gone downstairs, Jane did not want to go downstairs without one of her sisters going down with her.</t5941>
<t5942>The same anxious atmosphere was clearly present in the evening.</t5942> <t5943>After having tea, Mr. Bennet returned to the study as usual, and Mary went upstairs to practice music.</t5943> <t5944>Three of the five obstacles remained.</t5944> <t5945>Mrs. Bennet sat watching and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a long time without any response.</t5945> <t5946>Elizabeth did not want to look at her, and when Kitty finally noticed, she innocently asked:</t5946>
<t5947>- Mom, what's going on? Why do you keep winking at me? What should I do?</t5947>
<t5948>- There's nothing, my child, nothing.</t5948> <t5949>Mom didn't wink at you.</t5949>
<t5950>Then she sat still for a moment, but not wanting to let such an opportunity go to waste, she suddenly stood up and said to Kitty:</t5950>
<t5951>- Come here, my dear, I have something to tell you.</t5951>
<t5952>Then she led Kitty out of the room.</t5952> <t5953>Jane immediately looked at Elizabeth, showing that she was extremely confused, and she wished her sister wouldn't leave.</t5953> <t5954>A moment later, she slightly opened the door and called in:</t5954>
<t5955>- Lizzy, my dear, I have something to tell you.</t5955>
<t5956>Elizabeth had to go out.</t5956>
<t5957>The mother said, as soon as she reached the hallway:</t5957>
<t5958>- Of course I know, I need to give you two some privacy.</t5958> <t5959>Kitty and mother will sit in the dressing room upstairs.</t5959>
<t5960>Elizabeth did not want to argue with her mother, but she still stood silently in the hallway until she and Kitty left, then returned to the living room.</t5960>
<t5961>Mrs. Bennet's intentions for the day did not succeed.</t5961> <t5962>Bingley was charming in every way except for proposing to her daughter.</t5962> <t5963>His easygoing and cheerful demeanor made the gathering very pleasant.</t5963> <t5964>He endured the mother's meddlesome and tactless behavior well, patiently listening to all her absurd remarks with a calm expression, which made the daughter appreciative.</t5964>
<t5965>He did not need to be invited to stay for a late meal; before he left, he and Mrs. Bennet agreed that he would return the next morning to go hunting with her husband.</t5965>
<t5966>After this day, Jane no longer spoke of her coldness.</t5966> <t5967>The sisters did not say a word to each other about Bingley, but Elizabeth was pleased to think that everything would end well, except that Mr. Darcy would return at the time as announced.</t5967> <t5968>However, she seriously believed that all this must have happened with his consent.</t5968>
<t5969>Bingley arrived on time, as both parties had promised, and he and Mr. Bennet spent the whole morning together.</t5969> <t5970>He appeared more agreeable than Mr. Bennet had thought.</t5970> <t5971>He showed no signs of boldness or recklessness that would provoke Mr. Bennet to mock him, or cause him to hold him in contempt and remain silent.</t5971> <t5972>He spoke more lively and maturely than Mr. Bennet had previously seen.</t5972> <t5973>Bingley returned with Mr. Bennet for dinner, after which Mrs. Bennet devised all sorts of ways to keep everyone away from him and Jane.</t5973> <t5974>Right after tea, Elizabeth went into the breakfast room because she needed to write a letter, and since the others had sat down around the card table, she did not want to go against her mother's intentions.</t5974>
<t5975>But after finishing the letter, she returned to the living room and, to her utmost surprise, she found a reason to fear that her mother had been too shrewd. When she opened the door, she saw her sister and Mr. Bingley standing together by the fireplace, as if they were having an earnest conversation. If that wasn't enough, their expressions when they hurriedly turned away and moved apart to sit down said it all.</t5975> <t5976>Both looked embarrassed, but she seemed even more awkward.</t5976> <t5977>No one spoke a word, and Elizabeth was about to leave when Bingley suddenly stood up, whispered a few words into her sister's ear, and then rushed out.</t5977>
<t5978>Jane could not be reserved with Elizabeth when she felt such joy that she wanted to reveal it.</t5978> <t5979>She immediately embraced her sister and, in the most vivid emotion, confessed that she was the happiest creature in the world.</t5979> <t5980>She added:</t5980>
<t5981>- That's too much! You don't deserve that.</t5981> <t5982>Oh dear! Why can't others have such happiness?</t5982>
<t5983>Elizabeth congratulated her with all the sincerity, warmth, and joy that no words could fully express.</t5983> <t5984>Every affectionate word was a new source of happiness for Jane.</t5984> <t5985>But at this moment, she did not want to stay close to her sister for long, nor say anything more that needed to be said.</t5985> <t5986>She exclaimed:</t5986>
<t5987>- I want to go to mother immediately.</t5987> <t5988>I don't want to belittle mother's worries and compassion, or let her receive the news through someone else.</t5988> <t5989>He has gone to meet father.</t5989> <t5990>Oh dear! Lizzy, just think about how the news I bring will make the whole family so happy! How can I endure such immense happiness!</t5990>
<t5991>Then she hurriedly ran to find her mother.</t5991> <t5992>Her mother had already decided to break up the card game and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.</t5992>
<t5993>Sitting alone, Elizabeth now smiled at how their love story had quickly and easily reached a settled conclusion - a love story that had caused them tension and anxiety for many months.</t5993>
<t5994>She thought: "And this is the outcome of all the careful worries in your friend! of all the deceit and tricks in your sister! The happiest, wisest, most reasonable outcome!</t5994>
<t5995>In a moment, Mr. Bingley returned.</t5995> <t5996>The exchange between her father and him was brief and straight to the point.</t5996> <t5997>He hurriedly asked as he opened the door:</t5997>
<t5998>- Where is your sister?</t5998>
<t5999>- She went upstairs to meet her mother.</t5999> <t6000>She will come down right away, I am sure of it.</t6000>
<t6001>Then he closed the door and approached her, receiving her congratulations and affection. Elizabeth expressed sincerely and warmly about the prospect between the two of them.</t6001> <t6002>They shook hands in utmost friendliness, and while waiting for her sister to come down, she had to listen to everything he wanted to say about his happiness.</t6002> <t6003>Even though he was in love, Elizabeth truly believed that all his expectations of happiness were based on reason, because there was a wonderful mutual understanding between them, Jane's extremely good character, along with the similarities in feelings and tastes between the two.</t6003>
<t6004>This is an evening where each person rejoices in their own way.</t6004> <t6005>The contentment on Miss Bennet's face cast a sweet lively glow, making her more beautiful than ever.</t6005> <t6006>Kitty, with her colorful smile, hoped that her turn would come soon.</t6006> <t6007>Mrs. Bennet could neither respond approvingly to her daughter's wishes nor express agreement with sweet words to satisfy her youngest daughter's heart, even though she spent half an hour talking only with Mr. Bingley about happiness.</t6007> <t6008>When Mr. Bennet came down to join them for supper, his words and demeanor showed that he was truly happy.</t6008>
<t6009>However, he did not say a word about this joy until Bingley had left, but as soon as he had gone, he turned to his daughter and said:</t6009>
<t6010>- Jane, I congratulate you.</t6010> <t6011>You will become a very happy woman.</t6011>
<t6012>Jane went straight to him, kissed him, and thanked him for his affection.</t6012> <t6013>He replied:</t6013>
<t6014>- You are a good daughter, and I am very happy thinking you will be happy in your married life.</t6014> <t6015>I have no doubt that you two will get along well.</t6015> <t6016>Your temperaments do not clash at all.</t6016> <t6017>Each of you wants to indulge the other to the utmost, so there will be nothing that cannot be resolved; each of you is easygoing, so all the servants will deceive both of you; and each of you is generous, so you will always spend beyond your income.</t6017>
<t6018>- I hope that's not the case.</t6018> <t6019>Being wasteful or careless with money is unforgivable in your character.</t6019>
<t6020>The wife exclaimed:</t6020>
<t6021>- The target exceeds the income!</t6021> <t6022>Sir, what are you saying? What, he has four or five thousand a year, maybe more.</t6022>
<t6023>Then she said to her daughter:</t6023>
<t6024>My dear, dear Jane, I am so happy!</t6024> <t6025>I surely won't be able to sleep tonight.</t6025> <t6026>I knew it would be like this.</t6026> <t6027>I was certain you couldn't be so beautiful without getting something in return.</t6027> <t6028>I still remember, right when I first met him, when he first came to Hertfordshire last year, I thought it was very likely the two of you would pair up.</t6028> <t6029>Oh! He is the most handsome young man I have ever seen!</t6029>
<t6030>Wickham and Lydia were both forgotten.</t6030> <t6031>Jane had surpassed all comparisons with the daughter she cherished the most.</t6031> <t6032>At this moment, she no longer cared about anyone else.</t6032> <t6033>The younger sisters began to pay attention to her because of the benefits she might bestow in the future.</t6033>
<t6034>Mary asked to use the reading room at Netherfield, and Kitty began to insist on having a few balls there each winter.</t6034>
<t6035>From that moment, of course, Bingley became a daily visitor to Longbourn.</t6035> <t6036>He often arrived before breakfast and always stayed until supper, unless some terribly disliked, rude neighbor invited him to dinner, which he felt obliged to accept.</t6036>
<t6037>Elizabeth now had little time to converse with her sister, for when he was present, Jane paid attention to no one else, but Elizabeth found it very beneficial for both of them during the hours when the two were not together.</t6037> <t6038>In Jane's absence, he always paid attention to Elizabeth because he enjoyed talking to her; and when Bingley was away, Jane always sought solace in the same manner.</t6038>
<t6039>One afternoon, she said:</t6039>
<t6040>- He made you feel very happy when he told you that he had no idea you were in the city during the spring! You couldn't believe such a thing.</t6040>
<t6041>- I think exactly like that.</t6041> <t6042>But how does he explain this?</t6042>
<t6043>- This must be because of your sister.</t6043> <t6044>Surely your sister doesn't like seeing you involved with me.</t6044> <t6045>I'm not surprised by this because there could have been more favorable choices, in many respects.</t6045> <t6046>But I believe that once they see their loved one happy with me, they will be content, and everything will return to a good relationship, even if it can never be exactly as it was before.</t6046>
<t6047>- This is the most generous speech I have ever heard you utter.</t6047> <t6048>Good girl! Actually, it worries me to see you being deceived by Miss Bingley's feigned affection.</t6048>
<t6049>- Lizzy, do you believe it? When I went to the city last November, I truly loved her, and it was only because I thought she was indifferent to me that I didn't want to return, not for any other reason!</t6049>
<t6050>- Surely you have made a small mistake, but this is only because you are modest.</t6050>
<t6051>In a very natural way, this made Jane sing praises about his shyness, about how he did not deliberately flaunt his good qualities.</t6051>
<t6052>Elizabeth was pleased to see that he had not revealed anything about his friend's intervention, because although Jane had the most generous and open-hearted nature in the world, if she understood, she would have a prejudice against Darcy.</t6052>
<t6053>Jane exclaimed:</t6053>
<t6054>- Surely you are the luckiest creature!</t6054> <t6055>Oh Lizzy, why are you treated so specially in the whole family, more specially than anyone else! If only you could see me being as happy as this! If there were another young man like that for me!</t6055>
<t6056>- If you gave me forty young men like that, I would still never feel as happy as you.</t6056> <t6057>If I don't have the qualities you possess, the virtues you have, then I still wouldn't have happiness like yours.</t6057> <t6058>No, no, let me take care of it myself, and maybe if I'm really lucky, sooner or later I might meet another Mr. Collins.</t6058>
<t6059>The love story in the Longbourn family could not be kept secret for long.</t6059> <t6060>Mrs. Bennet had the privilege of whispering to Mrs. Philips, and without permission, the latter whispered to all her neighbors in Meryton.</t6060>
<t6061>Everyone quickly assumed that the Bennet family was the luckiest in the world, though just a few weeks earlier, when Lydia had run away from home, they were considered to be unfortunate.</t6061>
<t6062>Chapter 56</t6062>
<t6063>One morning, about a week after Bingley proposed to Jane, while he and the women of the family were conversing, they heard the sound of a carriage and saw a four-horse carriage driving into the grounds.</t6063> <t6064>It was too early for visitors to arrive, and moreover, none of the neighbors used such a carriage.</t6064> <t6065>The carriage was drawn by horses with harnesses, and both the body of the carriage and the attire of the coachman looked unusual.</t6065> <t6066>However, knowing for sure that someone was visiting, Bingley immediately signaled to Miss Bennet to avoid intruding on the family's privacy, and the two went out into the garden.</t6066> <t6067>The remaining three continued to speculate but could not find an answer, until the door opened, and the guest stepped in.</t6067> <t6068>It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</t6068>
<t6069>Of course, they thought there would be some surprise, but they were surprised beyond imagination; Elizabeth was more surprised than both Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, even though these two had not yet become acquainted with the guest.</t6069>
<t6070>Mrs. Catherine entered with more rudeness than usual, only slightly nodding in response to Elizabeth's greeting, then sitting down without saying a word.</t6070> <t6071>When she entered, Elizabeth had told her mother her name, though no one had asked for an introduction.</t6071>
<t6072>Mrs. Bennet was extremely surprised, though somewhat self-satisfied, that such a respected person had come to visit, and she received the guest with utmost courtesy.</t6072> <t6073>After sitting for a moment in silence, the guest dryly said to Elizabeth:</t6073>
<t6074>- I hope you are still well, Miss Bennet.</t6074> <t6075>I assume this lady is your mother.</t6075>
<t6076>Elizabeth replied affirmatively.</t6076>
<t6077>- And I think this is one of your sisters.</t6077>
<t6078>Mrs. Bennet replied, delighted to converse with a lady named Catherine:</t6078>
<t6079>- Yes, Madam.</t6079> <t6080>It is the second youngest.</t6080> <t6081>My youngest daughter is married, and the eldest one is walking somewhere in the garden with a young man, whom I believe will become a member of the family.</t6081>
<t6082>Lady Catherine said, after a moment of silence.</t6082>
<t6083>- She has a very small garden here.</t6083>
<t6084>- Madam, I dare say nothing can compare to Rosings, but I believe it is even larger than Sir William Lucas's garden.</t6084>
<t6085>- This must be the most inconvenient room in the evening, during the summer; all the windows face directly east.</t6085>
<t6086>Mrs. Bennet stated that the family never sat here after dinner, and added:</t6086>
<t6087>- May I ask, how are Mr. and Mrs. Collins?</t6087>
<t6088>- Very well.</t6088> <t6089>I met the two people the evening before last.</t6089>
<t6090>Now, Elizabeth thought she would hand over Charlotte's letter to be delivered to her, as this seemed to be the only reason for her visit here.</t6090> <t6091>But there was no letter, and she was utterly bewildered.</t6091>
<t6092>With the utmost politeness, Mrs. Bennet earnestly invited the Lady to have some refreshments, but Lady Catherine firmly, and not very politely, refused all food and drink, then stood up and said to Elizabeth:</t6092>
<t6093>- Miss Bennet, there seems to be a beautiful patch of greenery on one side of the garden.</t6093> <t6094>I would be very pleased to take a walk, if you would kindly show me the way.</t6094>
<t6095>The mother exclaimed:</t6095>
<t6096>- Go, my child, so the Lady can see different scenery.</t6096> <t6097>I think the Lady will like the solitude here.</t6097>
<t6098>Elizabeth obeyed, ran to her room to get an umbrella, and then escorted the important guest downstairs.</t6098> <t6099>As they walked along the hallway, Lady Catherine opened all the doors leading to the dining room and the drawing room, looked around, complimented the elegant rooms, and then continued walking.</t6099>
<t6100>The lady's carriage was still standing at the door, and Elizabeth saw the maid sitting in the carriage.</t6100> <t6101>They walked along the gravel path to the grove; Elizabeth decided there was no need to attempt conversation with the woman who had now become more insolent and unpleasant than usual.</t6101> <t6102>She thought to herself as she looked at the lady's face: "How could I ever have thought she was like her nephew?"</t6102>
<t6103>As soon as they entered the orchard, Lady Catherine began:</t6103>
<t6104>- Miss Bennet, you can easily understand the reason for my visit.</t6104> <t6105>Your feelings, your conscience must tell you why I have come here.</t6105>
<t6106>Elizabeth appeared surprised in a calm manner.</t6106>
<t6107>- Madam, in fact, you are mistaken.</t6107> <t6108>I have no knowledge of the reason for your being received here.</t6108>
<t6109>The lady responded, with an angry tone:</t6109>
<t6110>- Miss Bennet, you should know that I am not someone to be trifled with.</t6110> <t6111>But although you may wish to deceive, you will find that I am not like that.</t6111> <t6112>My character has always been expressed through honesty and straightforwardness, and for a purpose such as this, my character will certainly not change.</t6112> <t6113>Two days ago, I received very distressing news.</t6113> <t6114>I heard that not only is your sister about to marry advantageously, but also you, Miss Elizabeth Bennet, might very soon marry my nephew, Mr. Darcy.</t6114> <t6115>Although I know this is merely a scandalous falsehood, and although I do not wish to hurt my nephew by considering it might be true, I immediately set out to come here to let you know what I think about this matter.</t6115>
<t6116>Elizabeth said, blushing with surprise and disdain:</t6116>
<t6117>- If Madam believes that it is not the truth, I wonder why she took the trouble to come to such a distant place.</t6117> <t6118>What does Madam want to teach?</t6118>
<t6119>- I want you to deny the news like that, right now.</t6119>
<t6120>Elizabeth said coldly:</t6120>
<t6121>- Your visit to Longbourn to see me and my family seems to confirm that news, if indeed there is such news.</t6121>
<t6122>- If that's the case, are you pretending not to know this news?</t6122> <t6123>Weren't you the one who painstakingly spread this news?</t6123> <t6124>Do you know that this news has already spread widely?</t6124>
<t6125>- I have never heard of such a thing.</t6125>
<t6126>- And you want to say that this news has no basis at all, right?</t6126>
<t6127>- I do not want to pretend to have the same frankness as Madam.</t6127> <t6128>She can ask questions that I have the right not to answer.</t6128>
<t6129>- This is unacceptable.</t6129> <t6130>Miss Bennet, I want a satisfactory answer.</t6130> <t6131>Did he, my nephew, propose to you?</t6131>
<t6132>- The lady said that this matter could not possibly happen.</t6132>
<t6133>- It is indeed so, it must be so, when my nephew still knows how to use reason.</t6133> <t6134>But your art and allure can, in a moment of infatuation, make him forget that he owes a debt to himself and to everyone in his family.</t6134> <t6135>You may have seduced him into that infatuation.</t6135>
<t6136>- If I were like that, I would be the last person to confess to you.</t6136>
<t6137>- Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?</t6137> <t6138>I am not accustomed to hearing such language.</t6138> <t6139>I am almost the closest person to my niece in this world, I have the right to know about all her closest relationships.</t6139>
<t6140>- But you have no right to know about my relationships, and such an attitude will never make me confess.</t6140>
<t6141>- I want you to understand me very clearly.</t6141> <t6142>This marriage, which you have impudently expected, will never happen.</t6142> <t6143>No, never.</t6143> <t6144>Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.</t6144> <t6145>Now, what do you have to say?</t6145>
<t6146>- Just like this!</t6146> <t6147>If that's true, you have no reason to believe that he will confess his feelings to me.</t6147>
<t6148>Madam Catherine hesitated for a moment, then replied:</t6148>
<t6149>- The engagement between the two of them is an unusual matter.</t6149> <t6150>Since they were young, they have been betrothed to each other.</t6150> <t6151>This is the earnest wish of his mother, as well as her mother.</t6151> <t6152>While the two were still in their cradles, we had planned their marriage, and now, as the wish of the two sisters is about to come true, their wedding is being hindered by a young woman of a lower class, of no importance in this world, completely unrelated to the family!</t6152> <t6153>Do you not care about the wishes of my niece's relatives?</t6153> <t6154>About the implicit engagement of Miss De Bourgh?</t6154> <t6155>Have you lost all sense of propriety and delicacy?</t6155> <t6156>Did you not hear me say that, since ancient times, my niece has been his intended?</t6156>
<t6157>- Yes, I have heard that before.</t6157> <t6158>But what does that mean to me? If no one else objects to my marrying your grandson, I certainly won't back down upon learning that his mother and aunt want him to marry Miss De Bourgh. Both of them have done what they could to arrange the marriage.</t6158> <t6159>Whether the marriage succeeds or not depends on others.</t6159> <t6160>If Mr. Darcy does not wish to marry his cousin out of honor or affection, why can't he have another choice?</t6160> <t6161>And if that choice is me, why can't I accept him?</t6161>
<t6162>- Because honor, etiquette, caution - no, this is a right - prohibit it.</t6162> <t6163>Yes, Miss Bennet, this is a right, for you should not expect my family and my nephew's acquaintances to acknowledge you if you deliberately act against everyone's wishes.</t6163> <t6164>All those related to him will condemn, disdain, and scorn you.</t6164> <t6165>The marriage will be a disgrace, and no one in my family will want to mention your name.</t6165>
<t6166>Elizabeth replied:</t6166>
<t6167>- These are the heavy misfortunes.</t6167> <t6168>But Mr. Darcy's wife will surely be connected to the most wonderful sources of happiness, so she will have no reason to complain.</t6168>
<t6169>- You stubborn, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this how you repay the care I gave you last spring?</t6169> <t6170>Don't you feel you owe me something?</t6170> <t6171>Let's sit down.</t6171> <t6172>Miss Bennet, you should understand that I came here with the determination to achieve my goal, and nothing can sway me.</t6172> <t6173>I am not accustomed to submitting to anyone's whims.</t6173> <t6174>I am not in the habit of enduring disappointment.</t6174>
<t6175>- This will make the current situation of the Lady even more pitiable, but it does not affect me.</t6175>
<t6176>- I do not want to be interrupted.</t6176> <t6177>Be quiet and listen to me.</t6177> <t6178>My daughter and my grandson were raised to live together.</t6178> <t6179>Both have maternal relations from the same noble lineage, and paternal relations from respectable, honorable families, though not titled.</t6179> <t6180>The wealth of both sides is abundant. They have been paired together by the voice of every family member, what could possibly prevent them?</t6180> <t6181>The arrogant expectations of a young girl not from a noble family, with no good connections, no wealth.</t6181> <t6182>And to endure this! But no, it cannot be.</t6182> <t6183>If she were sensitive to her value, she would not want to step away from the social standing in which she was raised.</t6183>
<t6184>- If I were to marry your grandson, I think I wouldn't have to leave my position.</t6184> <t6185>He is a nobleman, I am the daughter of a nobleman.</t6185> <t6186>Up until now, we are equal.</t6186>
<t6187>- Correct.</t6187> <t6188>You are the daughter of a noble father.</t6188> <t6189>But who is your mother?</t6189> <t6190>Who are your uncles and aunts?</t6190> <t6191>Don't think I know nothing about your circumstances.</t6191>
<t6192>- No matter what my relationships are, if your grandson doesn't care, then it has nothing to do with you.</t6192>
<t6193>- Tell me definitively, do you have a romantic relationship with him?</t6193>
<t6194>Although Elizabeth might not answer this question merely to oblige Lady Catherine; after a moment of thought, she had to say:</t6194>
<t6195>- I don't have it.</t6195>
<t6196>Mrs. Catherine seemed pleased.</t6196>
<t6197>- And can you promise me that you will never have such a relationship, can you?</t6197>
<t6198>- I don't promise anything about this.</t6198>
<t6199>- Miss Bennet, I am shocked and surprised.</t6199> <t6200>I had hoped to meet a more sensible young lady.</t6200> <t6201>But do not delude yourself that I will yield.</t6201> <t6202>I will not leave unless you assure me of what I request.</t6202>
<t6203>- And certainly, I never guarantee anything about this matter.</t6203> <t6204>I am not easily threatened into accepting anything completely unreasonable like this.</t6204> <t6205>The lady wants Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter, but when I promise what she wants, will their marriage be more successful?</t6205> <t6206>Suppose he loves me, will my refusal make him declare his love for his cousin?</t6206> <t6207>Lady Catherine, allow me to say that the arguments you present to justify this extraordinary demand are as frivolous as the manner in which you make this ill-considered demand.</t6207> <t6208>You have mistaken my character if you think I can be persuaded by such means.</t6208> <t6209>How your nephew will think of you when you interfere in his love affairs, I cannot say, but surely you have no right to interfere in mine.</t6209> <t6210>Therefore, I ask you not to trouble me any further about this matter.</t6210>
<t6211>- Don't be hasty.</t6211> <t6212>I haven't finished speaking.</t6212> <t6213>With all the arguments I've made against you, I have one more thing.</t6213> <t6214>I know all the details about the scandal when your youngest sister ran away with a man.</t6214> <t6215>I know everything, I know that his marriage to the girl was just a patch-up measure, with the expenses borne by your father and your uncle.</t6215> <t6216>And can such a girl be the sister-in-law of my nephew?</t6216> <t6217>Can her husband, a son of a servant working for his grandfather, be the brother-in-law of my nephew?</t6217> <t6218>Good heavens! What do you think about this! Will the Pemberley estate be tainted like that</t6218><t6219>?</t6219>
<t6220>She replied, annoyed:</t6220>
<t6221>- Now you have nothing more to say.</t6221> <t6222>You have humiliated me in every possible way.</t6222> <t6223>I beg you to return home.</t6223>
<t6224>And she spoke while standing up.</t6224> <t6225>Lady Catherine also stood up, and both of them turned back.</t6225> <t6226>Lady Catherine was very angry.</t6226>
<t6227>- So, you don't care about my nephew's honor and reputation! You are an insensitive, selfish girl! Do you think your relationship with him is a disgrace in the eyes of everyone?</t6227>
<t6228>- Mrs. Catherine, I have nothing more to say.</t6228> <t6229>You have understood my feelings.</t6229>
<t6230>- So you are determined to take my grandchild?</t6230><t6231>?</t6231>
<t6232>- I didn't say anything about such a matter. I just firmly decided to act in a way that I believe will create happiness for me without involving you, or anyone else who has no relation to me.</t6232>
<t6233>- Alright.</t6233> <t6234>So you refused my request.</t6234> <t6235>You refused to comply with all the demands of duty, honor, and gratitude.</t6235> <t6236>You insist on ruining my nephew's life in the eyes of all his loved ones, causing him to be scorned by the world.</t6236>
<t6237>- All duties, honors, and gratitude cannot have any plea in a situation like this.</t6237> <t6238>And my marriage to Mr. Darcy does not violate any principle at all.</t6238> <t6239>And speaking of his family's outrage, even if the family were delighted about his marrying me, I wouldn't care in the slightest.</t6239> <t6240>Or speaking of the world's disdain, generally, the world must have too much consciousness to interfere.</t6240>
<t6241>- And that is her true opinion!</t6241> <t6242>This is your final decision?! Very well.</t6242> <t6243>Now I know how to act.</t6243> <t6244>Miss Bennet, don't think your ambition will come true.</t6244> <t6245>I came here to try to settle things with you.</t6245> <t6246>I had hoped you were reasonable, so that I could persuade you.</t6246>
<t6247>In such a tone, Lady Catherine continued to speak until they reached the carriage, then suddenly turning back, she added:</t6247>
<t6248>- Miss Bennet, I am not saying goodbye to you.</t6248> <t6249>I do not wish to send my regards to your mother.</t6249> <t6250>You do not deserve such attention.</t6250> <t6251>I am extremely displeased.</t6251>
<t6252>Elizabeth did not answer and did not want to try to persuade her to come back into the house.</t6252> <t6253>She quickly turned away.</t6253> <t6254>She heard the sound of the carriage leaving as she ascended the steps.</t6254> <t6255>Her mother anxiously came out to meet her at the living room door, to ask why Lady Catherine did not come back into the house to rest.</t6255>
<t6256>Her daughter replied:</t6256>
<t6257>- She doesn't want to, she wants to go.</t6257>
<t6258>- She looks so beautiful!</t6258> <t6259>And she is so polite to visit us! Because mother thinks she came just to let us know that Mr. Collins' family is still doing well.</t6259> <t6260>I am sure she was on her way somewhere, and when passing through Meryton, she intended to visit you.</t6260> <t6261>I don't think she had anything special to say to you, did she, Lizzy?</t6261>
<t6262>Elizabeth had to tell a little lie because she couldn't possibly reveal the content of the conversation between the two.</t6262>
<t6263>Chapter 57</t6263>
<t6264>Elizabeth could not calm the turmoil in her mind caused by that unusual visit, and for many hours, she could not stop thinking about it.</t6264> <t6265>It seemed that Lady Catherine had taken the trouble to come from Rosings with the sole purpose of preventing her relationship with Mr. Darcy.</t6265> <t6266>Indeed, this was a reasonable assumption! But Elizabeth could not understand how news of their relationship had spread, and she recalled that he was a close friend of Bingley, while she was Jane's sister.</t6266> <t6267>That was enough to spark the idea, when the desire for a marriage made everyone excited about another wedding.</t6267> <t6268>She herself had not forgotten that her sister's marriage would certainly bring her and Darcy closer together more often.</t6268> <t6269>And thus, the neighbors at the Lucas house had concluded that this would surely and quickly happen, while she herself only hoped it could be possible in the future.</t6269> <t6270>She guessed that Lady Catherine had learned about it through the information exchanged between the Lucas and Collins households.</t6270>
<t6271>However, upon reconsidering Lady Catherine's words, she couldn't help but feel some unease about the consequences of her insistence on intervening.</t6271> <t6272>From her determined words to prevent the wedding, Elizabeth suddenly thought that she would surely persuade her nephew, and she dared not think how he would react to arguments about the detrimental aspects of their relationship.</t6272> <t6273>She was not exactly sure of his feelings towards his aunt, but naturally, one could assume that he thought more highly of Lady Catherine than she could.</t6273> <t6274>It was certain that when listing the drawbacks of a marriage with someone of unequal social standing, his aunt would exploit his weakest points.</t6274> <t6275>With his notions of propriety, he might think that the arguments, which Elizabeth found weak and laughable, were reasonable and solid.</t6275>
<t6276>If before he seemed to hesitate, not knowing what to do, now the advice and encouragement of such a close relative could dispel all doubts and determine that he immediately becomes happy in a way that an unblemished dignity can help him be happy.</t6276> <t6277>In this case, he would not return to her anymore.</t6277> <t6278>On the way, Lady Catherine might meet him in the city, and he would have to abandon the idea of returning to Netherfield with Bingley.</t6278>
<t6279>She thought further: "Therefore, if in the next few days he makes excuses to his friends about not keeping his promises, I will understand the situation.</t6279> <t6280>I will give up all hopes about his loyalty.</t6280> <t6281>If he is only complacent with feeling sorry for himself, when he could win my affection, soon I might not regret anything about him anymore."</t6281>
<t6282>When they heard the news about the visitor, the rest of the family were extremely surprised, but they accepted Mrs. Bennet's explanation, and Elizabeth escaped everyone's teasing.</t6282>
<t6283>The next morning, as she was walking down the stairs, just as her father was coming out of the study, holding a letter in his hand.</t6283> <t6284>He said:</t6284>
<t6285>- Lizzy, I'm looking for you.</t6285> <t6286>Come into my room.</t6286>
<t6287>She followed him, increasingly curious about what he would say to her, which she guessed was related to the letter in his hand.</t6287> <t6288>Suddenly, she guessed this might be a letter from Lady Catherine, and she became disheartened thinking about the explanations that would follow.</t6288>
<t6289>The two people sat down near the fireplace, then he said:</t6289>
<t6290>- Dad received this letter this morning.</t6290> <t6291>Dad was extremely surprised.</t6291> <t6292>Since it mainly concerns you, you need to know the content.</t6292> <t6293>Previously, Dad did not know he had two daughters about to get married.</t6293> <t6294>Dad congratulates you on a very important conquest.</t6294>
<t6295>Elizabeth's face turned red with joy when she immediately thought it was a letter from her nephew instead of her aunt.</t6295> <t6296>While she didn't know whether to be happy because he had calmed everything down, or upset because he didn't write to her directly, her father spoke up:</t6296>
<t6297>- You seem alert.</t6297> <t6298>Young girls have the ability to see through such matters, but I think I can even challenge your sharp intellect.</t6298> <t6299>This letter is from Mr. Collins.</t6299>
<t6300>- Mr. Collins!</t6300> <t6301>And what did he write?</t6301>
<t6302>- Of course, it's something that goes straight to the point.</t6302> <t6303>He began the letter with congratulations to Father on the upcoming wedding of his eldest daughter.</t6303> <t6304>It seems he heard the news from one of the kind-hearted, or gossiping, members of the Lucas family.</t6304> <t6305>Father didn't want to test your patience, so he didn't read this part.</t6305> <t6306>The part related to you is as follows: "After expressing the sincerest congratulations from Mrs. Collins and myself on that happy event, I now briefly address another matter.</t6306> <t6307>According to the same source, it is speculated that your daughter Elizabeth will soon no longer bear the Bennet surname.</t6307> <t6308>After the eldest daughter has taken another name, and the partner she has chosen is one of the most illustrious figures in this country."</t6308>
<t6309>He spoke to Elizabeth while reading the letter:</t6309>
<t6310>- Lizzy, can you guess who he is referring to? "This young man is strangely endowed with many blessings, with everything that a mortal heart could dream of the most - magnificent wealth, noble lineage, and extensive patronage."</t6310> <t6311>However, despite such temptations, I must warn my cousin Elizabeth, and warn you, about the calamities that may arise from hastily accepting his proposal, which with these advantages, of course, no one would want to overlook." Lizzy, do you know who he is?</t6311> <t6312>But here you will know: "The motivation that compels me to warn is this.</t6312> <t6313>We have reason to believe that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, views the marriage with disfavor."</t6313>
<t6314>He continued:</t6314>
<t6315>- Mr. Darcy, my dear, it is him!</t6315> <t6316>Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you.</t6316> <t6317>Could he, or the Lucas family, lie more blatantly than that when mentioning his name?</t6317> <t6318>Mr. Darcy, who always looks at women through their flaws, and who probably would never have looked at you in his entire life! It's truly remarkable!</t6318>
<t6319>Elizabeth wanted to chime in with her father's joke, but could only manage a forced smile.</t6319> <t6320>Never before had his manner of joking become so unpleasant to her as it was now.</t6320> <t6321>He asked:</t6321>
<t6322>- Are you distracted?</t6322>
<t6323>- Ah, yes.</t6323> <t6324>Please continue reading, Dad.</t6324>
<t6325>- "Last night, after mentioning the possibility of this wedding, she immediately humbled herself as usual to give her opinion, when it was obvious that, due to much opposition related to my cousin, she would never accept what she called a disgraceful marriage.</t6325> <t6326>I think I have a duty to quickly inform my cousin of this news, so that she and her noble suitor are aware of the situation and do not hastily proceed with the marriage without proper consent."</t6326>
<t6327>He paused and then continued:</t6327>
<t6328>- Mr. Collins continued writing like this: "I am truly delighted to see that Miss Lydia's unfortunate affair has been adequately covered up.</t6328> <t6329>I am only concerned that people will know they lived together before the wedding ceremony.</t6329> <t6330>However, I should not forget my duties in my position, and I do not want to restrain my expression of surprise upon hearing that you welcomed the two into your home immediately after they were married.</t6330> <t6331>This is an attitude that encourages sin, and if I were the clergyman in charge of the Longbourn parish, I would actively prevent this.</t6331> <t6332>As a Christian, you should certainly forgive, but you should never allow them to come near, nor permit others to mention their names to you." That is his view on the magnanimity of a Christian!</t6332> <t6333>The rest of the letter only talks about the situation of his dear Charlotte and his wish for an olive branch.</t6333> <t6334>But, Lizzy, it seems you are not happy.</t6334> <t6335>I hope you will not become a lady and pretend to be insulted by such trivial news.</t6335> <t6336>For what do we live, if not to endure our neighbors, and laugh with them in turn?</t6336>
<t6337>Elizabeth exclaimed:</t6337>
<t6338>- Oh! I have been overly distracted.</t6338> <t6339>These things are really strange.</t6339>
<t6340>- Right.</t6340> <t6341>The interesting thing is right there.</t6341> <t6342>If they were talking about any other young man, it wouldn't matter at all; but while he is completely indifferent and she bitterly hates him, the matter has become amusingly absurd! Although I don't like writing, I wouldn't ignore Mr. Collins's letter for any reason.</t6342> <t6343>No, when I read his letter, I couldn't help but like him more than Wickham, considering how I judge the brazen and hypocritical character of my son-in-law.</t6343> <t6344>Lizzy, tell me what Lady Catherine said about this?</t6344> <t6345>Did she come here to object?</t6345>
<t6346>The daughter only responded to the question with a laugh, because he asked without any suspicion, she did not feel uncomfortable when he repeated the question.</t6346> <t6347>Elizabeth had never been so flustered to create an appearance contrary to her feelings.</t6347> <t6348>She needed to laugh out loud, when she actually wanted to cry.</t6348> <t6349>Her father almost made her faint when he mentioned Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she only wondered why he did not investigate further.</t6349> <t6350>Or perhaps she also feared that instead of him knowing too little, she might have been too delusional.</t6350>
<t6351>Chapter 58</t6351>
<t6352>Instead of bringing a letter from his friend explaining why he couldn't return, as Elizabeth had half-believed, Bingley brought Darcy to Longbourn a few days after Lady Catherine's visit.</t6352> <t6353>The two arrived early, and before Mrs. Bennet had time to recount their meeting with his aunt, while her daughter sat in stunned silence, Bingley suggested a walk because he wanted some privacy with Jane.</t6353> <t6354>Everyone agreed. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking, and Mary had no time, but the remaining five set off together.</t6354> <t6355>However, it wasn't long before Bingley and Jane let the others go ahead.</t6355> <t6356>The two slowed down at the back, allowing Elizabeth, Darcy, and Kitty to converse with each other.</t6356> <t6357>No one said much; Kitty was too shy to ask him anything, Elizabeth was silently preparing for a purpose, and perhaps Darcy was too.</t6357>
<t6358>They went to Lucas's house because Kitty wanted to visit Maria, and because Elizabeth thought there was nothing to fear when Kitty wasn't with her, she boldly walked beside him alone.</t6358> <t6359>Now was the time for her to carry out her intention, and while she still had enough courage, she immediately began:</t6359>
<t6360>- Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish person, and while I tried to ease my own mind, I did not consider how I might hurt yours.</t6360> <t6361>I can no longer avoid thanking you for the unparalleled kindness you have shown to my wretched sister.</t6361> <t6362>Since I learned of this, I have been anxiously seeking a way to express to you how deeply grateful I am.</t6362> <t6363>If the rest of my family knew, I would not be speaking only of my own gratitude.</t6363>
<t6364>Darcy replied, surprised and moved:</t6364>
<t6365>- I regret, deeply regret, that you have been informed about the matter, which in a way could be misunderstood, causing you to feel uneasy.</t6365> <t6366>I had thought I could trust Mrs. Gardiner to keep the matter confidential.</t6366>
<t6367>- You should not blame my aunt.</t6367> <t6368>Lydia carelessly revealed to me that you were involved in this matter, and of course, I could not be at ease without knowing the details.</t6368> <t6369>On behalf of the entire family, I want to thank you, and thank you again, for the generous sentiment that made you go through such efforts and endure so much hardship to find the two people.</t6369>
<t6370>- If you want to thank me, your thanks alone are enough.</t6370> <t6371>I do not want to hide the fact that my desire to bring you happiness was an additional motivation among other reasons that compelled me to do it.</t6371> <t6372>But your family owes me nothing.</t6372> <t6373>While I still respect them, I only think of you.</t6373>
<t6374>Elizabeth was too embarrassed to say a word.</t6374> <t6375>After a moment of silence, he added:</t6375>
<t6376>- You have an open-hearted disposition, so I trust you won't make fun of me.</t6376> <t6377>If your feelings are still the same as they were last April, just let me know right away.</t6377> <t6378>My feelings and wishes remain unchanged, but just one word from you and I will never bring this up again.</t6378>
<t6379>The feelings in Elizabeth's mind had surpassed the usual awkwardness and worry for his situation.</t6379> <t6380>She felt compelled to confess.</t6380> <t6381>Though not very fluent, she immediately told him that her feelings had significantly changed from the moment he mentioned, so now she accepted his assertions with all respect and joy.</t6381> <t6382>Her answer created in him an immense happiness that he might never have felt in his life.</t6382> <t6383>He expressed to her the most sensitive and warm feelings that a person with intense love could articulate.</t6383> <t6384>If Elizabeth could look directly into his eyes, she could see the overflowing joy in his heart, spreading across his face, transforming his entire being.</t6384> <t6385>But although she couldn't see, she could hear, and he wanted her to understand how important a position she held in his heart.</t6385> <t6386>He revealed the thoughts that made his love grow stronger each moment.</t6386>
<t6387>The two continued walking without realizing which direction they were heading.</t6387> <t6388>There were too many things to ponder, to feel, to express.</t6388> <t6389>Now she knew that they owed his aunt for the mutual understanding between them at present.</t6389> <t6390>After returning, she had gone to see him, telling him about her trip to Longbourn, about her motives, and about the conversation between her and Elizabeth.</t6390> <t6391>Out of anxiety, she emphasized Elizabeth's stubborn and resolute attitude, believing that by doing so she would hear him promise what she had refused to promise.</t6391> <t6392>But, unfortunately for the Lady, the result was completely contrary to her wishes.</t6392>
<t6393>He said:</t6393>
<t6394>- This has given you hope that you previously did not dare to allow yourself to hope for much.</t6394> <t6395>You have known your feelings well enough to be sure that if you were determined not to accept his love, you would have said so frankly and clearly to Lady Catherine.</t6395>
<t6396>Elizabeth blushed and laughed:</t6396>
<t6397>- That's right, I know quite well how straightforward you are, so I believe you could say something like that.</t6397> <t6398>After having disgustingly insulted me to my face, you could unhesitatingly insult me in front of my loved ones.</t6398>
<t6399>- How did you talk about me?</t6399> <t6400>Did you say I was undeserving?</t6400> <t6401>Because, although your accusations are unfounded and based on mistaken premises, my attitude towards you before was indeed deserving of the harshest criticism.</t6401> <t6402>It was unforgivable.</t6402> <t6403>I cannot think about my past behavior without feeling disgusted.</t6403>
<t6404>Elizabeth said:</t6404>
<t6405>- We should not argue about who was more to blame that evening.</t6405> <t6406>If we consider it strictly, each person's behavior was reprehensible, but since then, both of us have become more courteous - I hope so.</t6406>
<t6407>- I cannot easily be at ease about myself.</t6407> <t6408>For many months, even until now, whenever I think about what I said, my behavior, my attitude, my expressions throughout the incident, somehow I always feel pain.</t6408> <t6409>Your reproach was truly justified, I can never forget "if you had the manners of a gentleman." These are your words.</t6409> <t6410>You don't know, you can't understand, how these words have tormented me, though I must admit that it took some time for me to realize you were right.</t6410>
<t6411>- I never thought my words would make such a strong impression.</t6411> <t6412>I completely didn't think you felt that way.</t6412>
<t6413>- You can easily trust me.</t6413> <t6414>At that time, I thought you weren't sensitive at all.</t6414> <t6415>You surely thought I felt that way.</t6415> <t6416>I'll never forget the look on your face when you said I couldn't confess my feelings to you in any other way to make you accept.</t6416>
<t6417>- Please don't bring up what I said back then.</t6417> <t6418>There is no use in remembering it forever.</t6418> <t6419>I hope you understand that I have long felt truly ashamed of my words.</t6419>
<t6420>Darcy talks about his letter.</t6420> <t6421>He asks:</t6421>
<t6422>- Will my letter make you think better of me not long after?</t6422> <t6423>After reading it, do you believe what I wrote?</t6423>
<t6424>She explained to him the effects that the letter had created in her mind, and how all her initial prejudices were gradually erased.</t6424>
<t6425>He said:</t6425>
<t6426>- I know that what I write will cause you pain, but it is necessary to write it.</t6426> <t6427>I hope you have destroyed the letter.</t6427> <t6428>There is one part in particular, the beginning, that if you read again will terrify me.</t6428> <t6429>I can remember a few words in the letter that might make you rightfully hate me.</t6429>
<t6430>- I will burn the letter if you believe this will preserve my feelings for you.</t6430> <t6431>However, although we both have reasons to believe that my sentiments are not entirely steadfast, I hope they are not easily changeable.</t6431>
<t6432>Mr. Darcy replied:</t6432>
<t6433>- When you wrote that letter, you believed you were completely calm and gentle, but then you realized that at that time you still harbored a terrible bitterness.</t6433>
<t6434>- Perhaps the letter began in bitterness, but the ending was not like that.</t6434> <t6435>The concluding sentence itself speaks of virtue.</t6435> <t6436>But we should not think about the letter anymore.</t6436> <t6437>The feelings of the writer and the recipient are now vastly different from back then, so it is necessary to forget all the unpleasant circumstances that created those feelings.</t6437> <t6438>You should follow my philosophy of life.</t6438> <t6439>Only think about the past if there is joy in remembering it.</t6439>
<t6440>- You cannot judge me philosophically like that.</t6440> <t6441>When I recall what happened, I have no intention of blaming, and I think your satisfaction here is not due to philosophy, but rather because you are carefree.</t6441> <t6442>But for me, it is not like that.</t6442> <t6443>Painful memories still intrude, which I cannot and should not dismiss.</t6443> <t6444>All my life I have been selfish, in attitude rather than in principle.</t6444> <t6445>As a child, I was taught to know what was right, but I was not taught how to control my temper.</t6445> <t6446>I learned about principles, but I was left to pursue those principles in pride and arrogance.</t6446> <t6447>Unfortunately for me, being the only son, I was spoiled by my parents to the point of becoming spoiled.</t6447> <t6448>My parents, although very good people themselves, allowed, encouraged, and almost trained me to become selfish and self-important, caring for no one outside my own family, looking down on the rest of the world or at least wanting to disdain their perceptions and true values compared to my own.</t6448> <t6449>I was like that, from eight to twenty-eight years old, and I would still be like that if it were not for you, my dearest Elizabeth!</t6449> <t6450>What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, initially a hard one, but the most beneficial.</t6450> <t6451>You properly humbled me.</t6451> <t6452>You showed me that all my arrogant expectations were not enough to win the heart of a truly worthy woman.</t6452>
<t6453>- So at that moment, did you believe that I should show you like that?</t6453>
<t6454>- Yes, I do.</t6454> <t6455>What do you think about my frivolity?</t6455>
<t6456>- My attitude was wrong, but I didn't mean it that way, I hope you believe me.</t6456> <t6457>I never wanted to deceive you, but my state of mind might have led me astray.</t6457> <t6458>That night, how much did you hate me?</t6458>
<t6459>- Hate you?!</t6459> <t6460>At first, he was angry, but gradually the anger shifted in the right direction.</t6460>
<t6461>- I was almost too afraid to ask what you thought of me when we met again at Pemberley.</t6461> <t6462>Do you blame me?</t6462>
<t6463>- Actually, I don't blame you, I'm just surprised.</t6463>
<t6464>- Your surprise cannot compare to mine, when you paid attention to me.</t6464> <t6465>My conscience tells me that I am not worthy of your utmost courtesy, I must confess that I did not expect to receive more than what I deserve.</t6465>
<t6466>- My intention at that time was, through courteous behavior within my ability, to show you that I wasn't so narrow-minded as to be upset about the past, and by showing that I had responded to your reproaches, I hoped you would forgive me and think less badly of me.</t6466> <t6467>I am not sure when other aspirations came about, but I believe it was within half an hour after I met you again.</t6467>
<t6468>Then he mentioned that Georgiana was pleased to make her acquaintance, expressed disappointment when she had to hastily return home, and naturally, this led to the reason for her return.</t6468> <t6469>Now she knew that he had resolved to find her sister even before he left her inn, she also understood that his stern and contemplative demeanor at this moment was due to an internal struggle with the sole purpose of being understood.</t6469>
<t6470>She expressed her gratitude once more, but both of them were still pained by the incident and did not want to say anything further.</t6470>
<t6471>After leisurely walking a few miles and with their minds unburdened by other matters so they were unaware of the distance, they finally checked the time and thought they should head back.</t6471>
<t6472>"I wonder how Bingley and Jane are doing now?" was the pressing question for the discussion about that love story.</t6472> <t6473>Darcy was pleased to see them happy, his friend had previously told him.</t6473>
<t6474>Elizabeth asked:</t6474>
<t6475>- Do you want to ask if I'm surprised?</t6475>
<t6476>- He is not surprised at all.</t6476> <t6477>When he left, he thought this would happen soon.</t6477>
<t6478>- This means you have allowed him to move forward.</t6478> <t6479>I guessed so.</t6479>
<t6480>And although he did not admit it was true, she thought it really was.</t6480> <t6481>He said:</t6481>
<t6482>- On the evening before he went to London, he confessed to Mr. Bingley something he should have done long ago.</t6482> <t6483>He told him everything about his unreasonable interference.</t6483> <t6484>Mr. Bingley was extremely surprised.</t6484> <t6485>He also explained to him that he was mistaken in thinking that your sister was indifferent to him, and since he could easily see that Mr. Bingley's feelings for her had not diminished, he was confident they would be happy together.</t6485>
<t6486>Elizabeth couldn't help but smile at the ease with which he steered his friend.</t6486> <t6487>She asked:</t6487>
<t6488>- When you told him that my sister loves him, did you say it based on your own observation, or just because of what I said earlier?</t6488>
<t6489>- From your observations.</t6489> <t6490>You have observed her very closely, from the two times you came later, and you believe that she truly loves Mr. Bingley.</t6490>
<t6491>- And I suppose when you believe so, Mr. Bingley also believes you.</t6491>
<t6492>- That's right.</t6492> <t6493>Bingley is the most genuinely shy person.</t6493> <t6494>He lacks confidence and cannot rely on his own judgment, so he depends on you, making everything easier.</t6494> <t6495>You must admit that something else made him feel justifiably offended for a while.</t6495> <t6496>You could no longer hide the fact that you knew the sisters had been residing in the city for three months but still did not inform him.</t6496> <t6497>He was angry.</t6497> <t6498>But you believe he won't be angry with you for long once he has no doubts about the sisters' love.</t6498> <t6499>He has now fully forgiven you.</t6499>
<t6500>Elizabeth wanted to remark that Mr. Bingley was the most charming and easily led friend, so her lover indeed had some talent.</t6500> <t6501>But she restrained herself.</t6501> <t6502>She remembered that he had not yet learned to endure jokes, and it was too soon to joke now.</t6502> <t6503>In the belief of Bingley's happiness, which of course was not equal to his current happiness, he continued the conversation until they reached home.</t6503> <t6504>They parted ways in the foyer.</t6504>
<t6505>Chapter 59</t6505>
<t6506>Everyone in the family asked her where she had been, but she only replied that the two of them had just wandered around here and there until she was no longer sure where she had gone.</t6506> <t6507>She blushed when she answered, but this or other things did not make anyone suspicious.</t6507>
<t6508>The evening passed peacefully without anything special.</t6508> <t6509>The couple who had publicly declared their love exchanged words and joked, while the couple who had not yet declared their love remained silent.</t6509> <t6510>Darcy did not have the temperament to express overwhelming happiness through jesting.</t6510> <t6511>Elizabeth was unsettled and confused; she recognized that she was happier than she felt; because besides the initial confusion, she also had unpleasant things ahead of her.</t6511> <t6512>She thought about her family's attitude when they learned about her love affair; she knew no one liked Darcy except Jane, and she feared that for the others, this was an aversion that even his wealth and status could not erase.</t6512>
<t6513>In the night, she confided her feelings to Jane.</t6513> <t6514>Although Miss Bennet was not in the habit of doubting anyone, she found it entirely hard to believe.</t6514>
<t6515>- Lizzy, you're joking with me.</t6515> <t6516>It can't be! Loving Mr. Darcy! No, no, you can't deceive me.</t6516> <t6517>I know this can't happen.</t6517>
<t6518>- Indeed, this matter is starting to get troublesome!</t6518> <t6519>I only rely on you, and I am sure no one will believe me if you don't believe me.</t6519> <t6520>That's right, we love each other.</t6520> <t6521>I only know how to tell the truth.</t6521> <t6522>He still loves me, and we have made promises to each other.</t6522>
<t6523>Jane looked at her, suspiciously:</t6523>
<t6524>- Oh dear, Lizzy, it can't be! I know how much you hate him.</t6524>
<t6525>- You don't know anything.</t6525> <t6526>The two of us have forgotten about that.</t6526> <t6527>Maybe I never loved him as much as I do now.</t6527> <t6528>But in situations like this, constantly remembering the past is unforgivable.</t6528> <t6529>This is the last time I want to remember it.</t6529>
<t6530>Mrs. Bennet still showed signs of astonishment.</t6530> <t6531>Once again, Elizabeth solemnly confirmed that it was true.</t6531> <t6532>Jane exclaimed:</t6532>
<t6533>- Oh my God! How can that be possible!</t6533> <t6534>Now you have to believe me, but are you sure? I'm sorry, but are you sure you will be happy with him?</t6534>
<t6535>- There is no doubt anymore.</t6535> <t6536>Both of us think we are the happiest couple in the world.</t6536> <t6537>But Jane, are you happy?</t6537> <t6538>Do you want a brother-in-law like that?</t6538>
<t6539>- Of course I want to.</t6539> <t6540>Nothing would make Mr. Bingley or me happier.</t6540> <t6541>But we have considered it before and said that it couldn't happen.</t6541> <t6542>And do you truly love him? Lizzy, you shouldn't marry without love! Are you sure you know what you are doing?</t6542>
<t6543>- Of course! I just think you feel more than know what to do when you tell me all about this.</t6543>
<t6544>- What do you mean?</t6544>
<t6545>- What? I just want to confess that I love him more than you love Mr. Bingley.</t6545> <t6546>I'm afraid you'll be angry.</t6546>
<t6547>- Hey, it's time to be serious now.</t6547> <t6548>I want to have a serious conversation.</t6548> <t6549>Tell me everything I want to know, right now.</t6549> <t6550>How long have you been in love with him?</t6550>
<t6551>- It came gradually, to the point that I found it hard to know when it started.</t6551> <t6552>But I believe it was when I saw the beautiful scenery at Pemberley.</t6552>
<t6553>However, she had to assure Jane that she was serious, and eventually, Jane believed her. Mrs. Bennet wished for nothing more.</t6553> <t6554>She said:</t6554>
<t6555>- Now I am so happy, because you will be as happy as I am.</t6555> <t6556>I have always held him in high regard.</t6556> <t6557>If for no other reason than his love for you, I would have already valued him; but now he is both Bingley's friend and your husband, only Bingley and you are the dearest people to me.</t6557> <t6558>But Lizzy, you have been too discreet, too reserved with me.</t6558> <t6559>You have told me very little about what happened at Pemberley and in London.</t6559> <t6560>I learned everything from others, not from you.</t6560>
<t6561>Elizabeth told her sister about the reasons why she had to be discreet.</t6561> <t6562>She could not mention Bingley, and while her mind was still in turmoil, she also wanted to avoid mentioning his friend’s name.</t6562> <t6563>But now she could not hide from her sister the fact that Mr. Darcy had helped with Lydia’s marriage.</t6563> <t6564>Everything was acknowledged, and they talked with each other until very late.</t6564>
<t6565>The next morning, while standing by the window, Mrs. Bennet exclaimed:</t6565>
<t6566>- My goodness! I hope that annoying Darcy doesn't come here anymore with dear Bingley!</t6566> <t6567>What does he mean by coming here and causing trouble like this?</t6567> <t6568>Mother just wants him to go hunting, or do something to keep from causing a disturbance.</t6568> <t6569>How are we going to deal with him?</t6569> <t6570>Lizzy, you must go for a walk with him again, so he doesn't bother Bingley.</t6570>
<t6571>Elizabeth could hardly avoid bursting into laughter at this favorable suggestion, but she was still annoyed that her mother kept talking about him in such a manner.</t6571>
<t6572>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her meaningfully and warmly shook her hand, as if to let her know he understood everything, then he said loudly:</t6572>
<t6573>- Mrs. Bennet, do you have another path for walking so that Lizzy can get lost again today?</t6573>
<t6574>Mrs. Bennet replied:</t6574>
<t6575>- I advise Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, and Kitty to take the road to Oakham Mountain today.</t6575> <t6576>The road is truly beautiful; and Mr. Darcy has never seen the scenery of this place before.</t6576>
<t6577>Mr. Bingley replied:</t6577>
<t6578>- It might be suitable for the other two, but I believe it is too strenuous for Kitty.</t6578> <t6579>Is that right, Kitty?</t6579>
<t6580>Kitty understood that she should stay at home.</t6580> <t6581>Darcy seemed eager to see the view from the mountain, while Elizabeth silently agreed.</t6581> <t6582>As she walked up the stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed, saying to her:</t6582>
<t6583>- Lizzy, I'm sorry for forcing you to go with that annoying guy.</t6583> <t6584>But I hope you don't mind, you know, this is for Jane, as she doesn't have many opportunities to talk to Bingley.</t6584>
<t6585>While taking a walk, the two agreed that they would ask Mr. Bennet for permission this evening.</t6585> <t6586>Elizabeth wanted to take it upon herself to seek her mother's opinion.</t6586> <t6587>She was unsure how her mother would receive the news; at times she feared that his wealth and status would not be enough to stop her mother from detesting him.</t6587> <t6588>But whether her mother reacted with intense opposition or intense joy, her demeanor would certainly not align with Elizabeth's sensibilities, and she could no longer bear the thought of Mr. Darcy having to hear her mother's initial enthusiastic remarks from joy, though it would be better than her initial angry remarks from disapproval.</t6588>
<t6589>*</t6589><t6590>*</t6590>
<t6591>In the evening, right after Mr. Bennet returned to the study, she saw Darcy stand up and follow him, her mind in extreme turmoil.</t6591> <t6592>She did not fear her father’s refusal, but she was worried that he would be upset, and it was because of her, his beloved daughter, that he would be saddened by her choice, causing him to regret her.</t6592> <t6593>She sat there, thinking endlessly in misery, until Darcy returned, and seeing him, she felt somewhat relieved by his smile.</t6593> <t6594>He came to her, whispering: "You should go see your father; he wants to meet you in the study."</t6594>
<t6595>The father is walking around the room, showing a serious and anxious expression.</t6595> <t6596>He says:</t6596>
<t6597>- Lizzy, what are you doing?</t6597> <t6598>Are you out of your mind, accepting a guy like that? Didn't you always hate him?</t6598>
<t6599>Now she earnestly wished that her initial opinions had been more appropriate, and her initial words had been more gentle! If that had been the case, she wouldn't have to explain and confess in such embarrassment, but she still had to try.</t6599> <t6600>With a few stumbling words, she persuaded her father to believe in her love for Darcy.</t6600>
<t6601>The father said:</t6601>
<t6602>- Or in other words, you want to marry him.</t6602> <t6603>He is wealthy, of course, and you could have more luxurious clothes, more splendid carriages than Jane's.</t6603> <t6604>But would these things make you happier?</t6604>
<t6605>Elizabeth asked:</t6605>
<t6606>- Does Dad have any other reason to oppose besides believing that I'm indifferent towards him?</t6606>
<t6607>- Nothing else.</t6607> <t6608>We all know he is a proud, difficult person, but this doesn't mean anything if you love him.</t6608>
<t6609>She replied, with tears at the corner of her eyes:</t6609>
<t6610>- I care about him, I love him.</t6610> <t6611>In fact, he has no undeserved pride.</t6611> <t6612>He is completely likable.</t6612> <t6613>You don't know what he is really like, so please don't make me suffer by using such words to talk about him.</t6613>
<t6614>- Lizzy, I accept.</t6614> <t6615>In fact, he is the kind of person whom I cannot refuse anything he has humbly begged for.</t6615> <t6616>Now, I yield to your wishes, if you are determined to marry him.</t6616> <t6617>But I want to advise you to think it through carefully.</t6617> <t6618>Lizzy, I know your nature.</t6618> <t6619>I know you cannot be happy if you do not truly love your husband, especially when he is not your equal.</t6619> <t6620>Your lively talents will place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage.</t6620> <t6621>You will find it hard to avoid scandal and suffering.</t6621> <t6622>My dear, do not let me be heartbroken to see you unable to respect your life partner.</t6622>
<t6623>Elizabeth was still emotional.</t6623> <t6624>She replied with the most earnest and solemn demeanor.</t6624> <t6625>She repeated that Mr. Darcy had always been the one she chose; she explained the gradual change in her assessment of him.</t6625> <t6626>She expressed her firm belief that his love was not fleeting, but had been tested through many challenging months.</t6626> <t6627>She passionately recounted his virtues.</t6627> <t6628>Finally, she managed to convince her father's doubts; he yielded to her.</t6628> <t6629>He spoke when she finished:</t6629>
<t6630>- Well then, my dear, I have nothing more to say.</t6630> <t6631>If that's true, he deserves you.</t6631> <t6632>Lizzy, I can't let you go with anyone less worthy than him.</t6632>
<t6633>Having been favorably impressed by him completely, she recounted what he had done for Lydia.</t6633> <t6634>He was utterly astonished:</t6634>
<t6635>- Indeed, this is an evening filled with wonders!</t6635> <t6636>And so, Darcy did everything: arranged the marriage, provided the money, paid off his debts; helped him join the military! All the better.</t6636> <t6637>It saved father a lot of trouble and finances.</t6637> <t6638>If you do this, father will have to pay off his debts and he will, but the young lovers are determined to do things their way.</t6638> <t6639>Tomorrow, father will offer to pay off his debts; he will boast about his love for you, and that will be the end of it.</t6639>
<t6640>Then he recalled her embarrassment a few days earlier, when he read Collins' letter, and after teasing her for a moment, he allowed her to go outside - saying as she turned away:</t6640>
<t6641>- If there is any young man who wants to marry Mary or Kitty, invite them in here, because father is very happy.</t6641>
<t6642>Elizabeth's mind was now relieved of a burden.</t6642> <t6643>After contemplating for about half an hour in her private room, she was calm enough to rejoin the gathering.</t6643> <t6644>Everything was quite new, so there was nothing enjoyable.</t6644> <t6645>The evening passed peacefully; there was not much to fear, and before long, the comfort of ease and familiarity would return.</t6645>
<t6646>When her mother went up to the living room that night, she followed her, announcing an extremely special piece of news.</t6646> <t6647>The effect was extraordinarily unusual, for at first, her mother sat quietly listening, unable to utter a word.</t6647> <t6648>For a moment, she could not understand what Elizabeth was saying.</t6648> <t6649>Then she began to collect herself, fidgeting in her chair, standing up, then sitting down again, bewildered and wondering, then exclaimed:</t6649>
<t6650>- Oh my! Thank my God! Just think about it!</t6650> <t6651>Oh dear! Mr. Darcy! Who could have imagined! Is it really true?</t6651> <t6652>Oh, my dear Lizzy! You will be rich and famous!</t6652> <t6653>You will have so much money, jewelry, and carriages.</t6653> <t6654>Compared to you, Jane is nothing - nothing at all.</t6654> <t6655>I am so happy, so joyful! What a charming young man, so handsome, so tall! Oh! Dear Lizzy! Forgive me for disliking him before! I hope he will forgive me.</t6655> <t6656>You, my dear Lizzy! A house in the city! Everything is so appealing! My God! What will become of me?!</t6656> <t6657>I am overwhelmed!</t6657>
<t6658>That was enough to know that she had agreed.</t6658> <t6659>Elizabeth was glad to see that only she had to hear such words.</t6659> <t6660>But she was only alone in her room for a moment.</t6660> <t6661>She followed her, exclaiming:</t6661>
<t6662>- My dearest child, I don't know what to think anymore! Ten thousand a year, maybe even more! It's like Heaven!</t6662> <t6663>And a special marriage license.</t6663> <t6664>You should marry with a special license.</t6664> <t6665>But my dearest child, tell me what Mr. Darcy likes the most so I can prepare it for tomorrow.</t6665>
<t6666>This is a forewarning of the mother's attitude towards him.</t6666> <t6667>Although she had been loved passionately by him and accepted by his relatives, Elizabeth understood that she still longed for a few other things.</t6667> <t6668>But the next day passed better than she thought, because fortunately Mrs. Bennet still had too much respect for her future son-in-law to dare to start a conversation with him, unless she wanted to show care or express respect for his opinion.</t6668>
<t6669>Elizabeth was delighted to see her father making an effort to be friendly with him, and before long, Mr. Bennet reassured her that he was growing to appreciate him more and more.</t6669> <t6670>He said:</t6670>
<t6671>- Dad loves all three of his sons-in-law.</t6671> <t6672>Perhaps Dad loves Wickham the most, but he thinks he will love your husband as much as Jane's husband.</t6672>
<t6673>Chapter 60</t6673>
<t6674>Elizabeth was in such high spirits that she felt like joking; she wanted Mr. Darcy to explain when he first began to love her.</t6674> <t6675>She asked:</t6675>
<t6676>- How did this start?</t6676> <t6677>I can understand that you continued in an engaging way after you started, but when did you start?</t6677>
<t6678>- He cannot pinpoint the date, or the place, or the look, or the words that laid the foundation.</t6678> <t6679>It has been a long time.</t6679> <t6680>He was in the process of continuing before he knew he had started.</t6680>
<t6681>- You have accepted my appearance, and regarding my gestures and attitude towards you, they are at least close to rudeness, and I often talk to you with the intention of hurting you.</t6681> <t6682>Now be honest with me, did you still love me at that time when I was being insolent to you?</t6682>
<t6683>- Still, because of the liveliness of your soul.</t6683>
<t6684>- You can call it insolent right here.</t6684> <t6685>It's not much less than that.</t6685> <t6686>The truth is, you are fed up with politeness, respectful manners, or proper etiquette.</t6686> <t6687>You despise women who only speak, act, and think with the sole purpose of catching your attention.</t6687> <t6688>You noticed me because I am different from them.</t6688> <t6689>If you weren't genuinely charming, I would have hated you for this attitude.</t6689> <t6690>But despite the pain you want to hide, your feelings are always noble and just, and in your heart, you completely detest those who fawn over you.</t6690> <t6691>There, you have helped me save the trouble of explaining, and honestly, when considering everything, I think it is entirely reasonable.</t6691> <t6692>I did not know clearly about your goodness, that must be it.</t6692> <t6693>But no one thinks about this when they are in love.</t6693>
<t6694>- When Jane was ill at Netherfield, wasn't your affectionate attitude towards her a good thing?</t6694>
<t6695>- Dearest Jane! Who could treat her so poorly?!</t6695> <t6696>But you can highlight this matter in every possible way.</t6696> <t6697>You defend all my virtues, and even try to exaggerate them as much as possible.</t6697> <t6698>In return, I find every opportunity to tease and argue with you as much as I can, and I will start right now by asking you what made you finally not want to get straight to the point.</t6698> <t6699>The first time you visited me and then stayed for dinner, what made you so shy with me?</t6699> <t6700>Especially when you arrived, why did you act as if you didn't care about me?</t6700>
<t6701>- Because you are solemn and silent, and you do not encourage me to be bolder.</t6701>
<t6702>- But because I was confused.</t6702>
<t6703>- And you too.</t6703>
<t6704>- You should have talked more with me when you came for dinner.</t6704>
<t6705>- Someone who thinks less about you would do that.</t6705>
<t6706>- Perhaps you have a reasonable answer, and I have a reasonable reason to accept it!</t6706> <t6707>But I wonder how long you will continue like this, if everything is left to you? I wonder when you will be willing to speak, if I do not ask you.</t6707> <t6708>My intention to thank you for your kindness towards Lydia had a great effect.</t6708> <t6709>I fear it was too great, because I should not have mentioned that secret, and if we feel comfortable about breaking promises, what will become of morality?</t6709> <t6710>This way is not good.</t6710>
<t6711>- You shouldn't torment yourself.</t6711> <t6712>Morality will still be quite good.</t6712> <t6713>The indefensible efforts of Lady Catherine to prevent us are the means to dispel all doubts.</t6713> <t6714>With the happiness I have, I do not owe you gratitude for your earnest thanks.</t6714> <t6715>My feelings at that time did not await your open-heartedness.</t6715> <t6716>What my aunt told me gave me hope, and I wanted to know everything immediately.</t6716>
<t6717>- Mrs. Catherine has contributed greatly, and this must make her happy if she likes to contribute.</t6717> <t6718>But, tell me, why did you come to Netherfield? Just to go to Longbourn and be confused?</t6718> <t6719>Or do you have a more serious intention?</t6719>
<t6720>- My main purpose is to meet you.</t6720> <t6721>And if possible, I hope to make you love me.</t6721> <t6722>The reason I gave, or the reason I created for myself, is to see if your sister still loves Mr. Bingley, and if she does, I will confess to Mr. Bingley about what I confessed afterward.</t6722>
<t6723>- If you have the courage to confess to Lady Catherine, how do you think she will react?</t6723>
<t6724>- Elizabeth, maybe you need more time than courage.</t6724> <t6725>But I will do this, and if you give me a piece of paper, I will write it immediately.</t6725>
<t6726>- And if I didn't have to write it myself, I would sit by your side to praise your straight lines, just as a woman once did.</t6726> <t6727>But I also have an aunt whom I must not forget.</t6727>
<t6728>Elizabeth had not yet written a reply to Mrs. Gardiner's long letter because she did not want to admit her feelings for Mr. Darcy.</t6728> <t6729>But now, with this news to write about, which she knew the reader would be very happy to hear, she was ashamed to think that her uncle and aunt had lost three days of happiness.</t6729> <t6730>Immediately, she wrote to them:</t6730>
<t6731>" My dear aunt, I should have thanked you earlier for the long, heartfelt letter, detailing everything that you wrote to me.</t6731> <t6732>But I must confess, I was so overwhelmed that I couldn't respond.</t6732> <t6733>You guessed more things than what actually happened at that time.</t6733> <t6734>But now, you can speculate as much as you like, let your mind wander far, let your imagination illuminate every aspect related to the matter, and you will not be mistaken in anything unless you believe that I have gotten married.</t6734> <t6735>You should write more to me and praise him more warmly than in the letter.</t6735> <t6736>I thank you and uncle, I want to thank you forever, for the decision not to go to the Lake District. How foolish I was to want to go! Your idea about the little horses is really wonderful.</t6736> <t6737>The two of us will drive around the garden.</t6737> <t6738>I am the happiest creature in the world.</t6738> <t6739>I am happier than Jane, she only smiles, I often laugh out loud.</t6739> <t6740>Mr. Darcy sends to you the love that he can spare from me.</t6740> <t6741>I hope your whole family will visit Pemberley during the Christmas holiday.</t6741>
<t6742>Your uncle and aunt's niece/nephew</t6742>
<t6743>"</t6743>
<t6744>Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine had a distinctly different style, and it was also different from Mr. Bennet's letter to Mr. Collins.</t6744>
<t6745>" Sir,</t6745>
<t6746>I will bother you, as you have to congratulate again.</t6746> <t6747>Elizabeth will soon become Mrs. Darcy. Please try to console Lady Catherine.</t6747> <t6748>But, if I were you, I would side with the nephew.</t6748> <t6749>He has more good things to offer.</t6749>
<t6750>Sincerely</t6750>
<t6751>"</t6751>
<t6752>Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother on his upcoming wedding were affectionate and insincere.</t6752> <t6753>She even wrote to Jane to express her joy and to repeat her previous expressions of affection.</t6753> <t6754>Jane was not deceived, but she was still touched; and although she did not trust her sister-in-law, she replied more kindly than what the sister-in-law deserved.</t6754>
<t6755>After receiving similar news, Miss Darcy's joy in writing to her brother was as genuine as his own happiness.</t6755> <t6756>The four pages were not enough to express all her delight and her desire to be loved by her sister-in-law.</t6756>
<t6757>Before receiving a reply from Mr. Collins, or congratulations from his wife to Elizabeth, the Longbourn family received news that Mr. and Mrs. Collins would be returning to the Lucas household.</t6757> <t6758>It wasn't long before they realized the obvious reason for the trip.</t6758> <t6759>Lady Catherine had become extremely angry after receiving her nephew's letter, to the extent that Charlotte wanted to stay away until the storm passed, but she still shared in the couple's happiness.</t6759> <t6760>At a time like this, her friend's presence was indeed a joy for Elizabeth, although when they met again, she sometimes had to acknowledge that the joy came at a high price, seeing Mr. Darcy having to endure all the ostentatious and obsequious manners of her friend's husband.</t6760> <t6761>However, he endured it commendably.</t6761> <t6762>He could even listen to Sir William Lucas's words when he praised Collins for having taken away the brightest gem in the land, and with proper demeanor, expressed every hope that they would meet again at St. James's.</t6762> <t6763>Only when Sir William was out of sight did he shrug his shoulders.</t6763>
<t6764>The rude demeanor of Mrs. Phillips was a torment, perhaps the greatest torment, for his endurance.</t6764> <t6765>Although Mrs. Phillips, like her sister, respected him too much to adopt the familiar attitude that Mr. Bingley cheerfully encouraged, whenever she spoke, she revealed her rudeness.</t6765> <t6766>Her respect for him only made her speak less, but did not help her become more elegant.</t6766> <t6767>Elizabeth did everything to ensure he was not overly noticed by the two ladies, always wanting him to stay close to her or with family members with whom he could converse comfortably.</t6767> <t6768>Although such feelings somewhat diminished the joy of a couple newly in love, this situation created hope for the future.</t6768> <t6769>She looked forward to the day when the two would break away from such unexciting relationships, to live together in comfort and elegance with his family at Pemberley.</t6769>
<t6770>Chapter 61</t6770>
<t6771>All of Mrs. Bennet's feelings of happiness were about the day she got rid of her two most deserving daughters.</t6771> <t6772>After that, the pride she would feel when visiting Mrs. Bingley and what she would say to Mrs. Darcy could only be speculated.</t6772> <t6773>Her earnest desire to establish families for her daughters had come true, and this created such great happiness that she became a sensible, pleasant, and understanding woman for the rest of her life.</t6773> <t6774>Although her husband might not quite match the family's unusual decorum, he was fortunate that her nerves still occasionally became as tense and foolish as before.</t6774>
<t6775>Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter very much, so his affection for her drew him out of the house more often than other reasons.</t6775> <t6776>He felt happy whenever he went to Pemberley, especially when everyone was surprised.</t6776>
<t6777>Mr. Bingley and Jane stayed at Netherfield for only twelve months.</t6777> <t6778>Even his easy-going nature or her affectionate heart did not much enjoy living close to her mother and Meryton.</t6778> <t6779>The earnest desire of his sisters was fulfilled; he bought an estate in the countryside near Derbyshire.</t6779> <t6780>Jane and Elizabeth, besides their sisterly bond, now lived only thirty miles apart.</t6780>
<t6781>Kitty, with many material advantages, mainly spent her time staying with her two eldest sisters.</t6781> <t6782>Although her new familial connections were of a much higher class than her friendships, she made significant personal progress.</t6782> <t6783>She did not have the uncontrollable temperament of Lydia, and once she was out of Lydia's influence, with proper care and management, she became less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.</t6783> <t6784>Of course, she was carefully kept away from Lydia's connections, and although Mrs. Wickham occasionally invited her to stay with promises of balls and young men, her father never allowed her to go.</t6784>
<t6785>Mary is the only daughter still left in the house.</t6785> <t6786>Being drawn into the pursuit of Mrs. Bennet's achievements, she could not sit still by herself.</t6786> <t6787>Mary had to integrate more with the world, but she still preached morality on every morning outing.</t6787> <t6788>Since she no longer had to suffer from the comparisons of beauty between her sisters and herself, her father thought she submitted to the change without much resistance.</t6788>
<t6789>As for Wickham and Lydia, their status did not change due to the weddings of the two elder sisters.</t6789> <t6790>He calmly accepted that Elizabeth must now know all about his ingratitude and mistakes that she was unaware of before, and despite what had happened, still hoped to gain material benefits from Darcy. Lydia's congratulatory letter to Elizabeth showed her that at least his wife, if not he himself, still harbored such hopes.</t6790>
<t6791>“Dear Lizzy</t6791>
<t6792>I wish you happiness.</t6792> <t6793>If you love Mr. Darcy half as much as I love Wickham, you will be very happy.</t6793> <t6794>It is quite pleasant to have such a wealthy sister, and when you have nothing to do, I hope you will think of the two of us.</t6794> <t6795>I believe Wickham is very eager to have a position in the court, but I don't think we have enough money to live without assistance.</t6795> <t6796>Any amount will do, around three or four hundred a year.</t6796> <t6797>But don't say anything to Mr. Darcy if you don't want to.</t6797>
<t6798>Your younger sibling</t6798>
<t6799>Because Elizabeth did not like it at all, when replying, she tried to put an end to all such pleas and expectations.</t6799> <t6800>However, she still assisted her sister within her means, by saving on her own expenses.</t6800> <t6801>She clearly saw that their combined income could never be enough for them to be wasteful in their destitution, and in a lifestyle that disregarded the future.</t6801> <t6802>Whenever they changed residences, they turned to Jane or Elizabeth for a little help in settling outstanding bills.</t6802> <t6803>Even when peace was restored, allowing them to return home, their way of life remained unstable.</t6803> <t6804>They always moved from place to place to find cheaper living arrangements, and always spent more than their income.</t6804> <t6805>His love for the youngest sister soon grew cold; her love lasted a little longer.</t6805> <t6806>Despite her youth and temperament, she bore all the gossip and slander that her marriage had caused.</t6806>
<t6807>Although Darcy never wanted to welcome him at Pemberley, to help Elizabeth, he still supported him in advancing his career.</t6807> <t6808>Lydia occasionally visited when her husband was enjoying himself in London or Bath.</t6808> <t6809>With the Bingley family, both Lydia and her husband often stayed for quite a long time, to the point where even Bingley's easygoing nature was exhausted, and he eventually found a way to subtly hint to the two that it was time for them to leave.</t6809>
<t6810>Miss Bingley was very distressed when Mr. Darcy got married, but because she thought she should retain the right to visit Pemberley, she set aside all her resentment, became closer to Georgiana, and treated Elizabeth well, albeit belatedly.</t6810>
<t6811>Georgiana now lives permanently at Pemberley; the relationship between sister-in-law and brother-in-law is just as Mr. Darcy had hoped.</t6811> <t6812>They love each other, and they love each other as much as they had intended.</t6812> <t6813>Elizabeth has a very good opinion of Georgiana, though at first she often listened with astonishment, almost to the point of alarm, at the lively, spirited manner in which the younger sister spoke to her brother.</t6813> <t6814>Previously, he had instilled in his sister a respect that almost surpassed affection, but now she saw him become the object of jest.</t6814> <t6815>The younger sister had acquired new knowledge that she had never known before.</t6815> <t6816>Through Elizabeth's teachings, she gradually understood that a woman could be at ease with her husband, while a brother might never allow a sister more than ten years his junior to adopt such an attitude.</t6816>
<t6817>Lady Catherine was extremely outraged by her nephew's marriage.</t6817> <t6818>When responding to the letter announcing the marriage, she revealed her true blunt nature and used heavy insulting language, especially towards Elizabeth, to the extent that for a time the two sides did not communicate with each other.</t6818> <t6819>But eventually, through Elizabeth's persuasion, Mr. Darcy managed to overlook the offense and sought reconciliation.</t6819> <t6820>His aunt continued to oppose for a while, then her anger subsided, perhaps due to her affection for him, or out of curiosity to know what his wife was like.</t6820> <t6821>She humbled herself to visit the couple at Pemberley, even though the estate was tainted not only by the presence of such a mistress, but also by the uncle and aunt from the city who came to visit.</t6821>
<t6822>In the Gardiner family, the couple has the closest relationship.</t6822> <t6823>Darcy, like Elizabeth, truly admires the couple and feels deeply grateful to the people who brought her to Derbyshire and subsequently acted as a bridge for the two to come together.</t6823>
