<t0>CHAPTER 1</t0>
<t1>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</t1>
<t2>However, little is known about the feelings or opinions of a man of such conditions when he becomes part of a neighborhood.</t2> <t3>This truth is so ingrained in the minds of some of the families around him, that some consider him their rightful property and others that of their daughters.</t3>
<t4>––My dear Mr. Bennet ––his wife said to him one day––, did you know that Netherfield Park has finally been rented?</t4>
<t5>Mr. Bennet replied no.</t5>
<t6>––Well, that's how it is ––she insisted––; Mrs. Long was here a moment ago and told me everything.</t6>
<t7>Mr. Bennet made no move to reply.</t7>
<t8>––Don't you want to know who rented it? ––his wife grew impatient.</t8>
<t9>––You are the one who wants to tell me, and I have no problem listening to it.</t9>
<t10>This suggestion was enough for him.</t10>
<t11>––Well, you should know, dear, that Mrs. Long says that Netherfield has been rented by a very rich young man from the north of England; that he came on Monday in a four-horse landau to see the place; and that he was so delighted with it that he immediately came to an agreement with Mr. Morris; that he will come to occupy it before Michaelmas; and that some of his servants will be in the house by the end of next week.</t11>
<t12>––What is your name?</t12>
<t13>––Bingley.</t13>
<t14>––Are you married or single?</t14>
<t15>––Oh! Single, dear, of course.</t15> <t16>A single man of great fortune; four or five thousand pounds a year.</t16> <t17>What a good match for our daughters!</t17>
<t18>––And what?</t18> <t19>How can it affect them?</t19>
<t20>––My dear Mr. Bennet ––replied his wife––, how can you be so naive?</t20> <t21>You must know that I am thinking of marrying him to one of them.</t21>
<t22>––Is that the reason that brought you here?</t22>
<t23>––"Reason! Nonsense, how can you say that?"</t23> <t24>"It is very possible that he may fall in love with one of them, and that is why you must go visit him as soon as he arrives."</t24>
<t25>––I don't see the reason for it.</t25> <t26>You can go with the girls or send them alone, which might be better; since you are as pretty as any of them, maybe Mr. Bingley will prefer you.</t26>
<t27>––Dear, you flatter me.</t27> <t28>It is true that at one time I wasn't bad at all, but now I can't pretend to be anything out of the ordinary.</t28> <t29>When a woman has five grown daughters, she must stop thinking about her own beauty.</t29>
<t30>––In such cases, most women don't have much beauty left to think about.</t30>
<t31>––Well, dear, really, you have to go visit Mr. Bingley as soon as he settles in the neighborhood.</t31>
<t32>––I don't guarantee it.</t32>
<t33>––But think of your daughters.</t33> <t34>Realize what a match it would be for one of them.</t34> <t35>Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, and only for that purpose.</t35> <t36>You know they usually don't visit new neighbors.</t36> <t37>Really, you must go, because it will be impossible for us to visit him if you don't.</t37>
<t38>––You are too modest.</t38> <t39>I am sure that Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and you will take him a few lines from me to assure him that he has my most sincere consent to marry one of them; although I will put in a good word for my little Lizzy.</t39>
<t40>––I refuse to let you do such a thing.</t40> <t41>Lizzy is no better than the others, she is not half as pretty as Jane, nor half as cheerful as Lydia.</t41> <t42>But you always prefer her.</t42>
<t43>––None of the three are very recommendable ––he replied––.</t43> <t44>They are as silly and ignorant as the other girls; but Lizzy has a bit more sharpness than her sisters.</t44>
<t45>––Mr. Bennet! How can you speak like that about your daughters?</t45> <t46>You love to upset me.</t46> <t47>You have no compassion for my poor nerves.</t47>
<t48>––You are mistaken, dear.</t48> <t49>I have a lot of respect for your nerves.</t49> <t50>They are old friends of mine.</t50> <t51>For at least twenty years, I have heard you mention them with much consideration.</t51>
<t52>––You don't know how much I suffer!</t52>
<t53>––But you will get well and live to see many young men with four thousand pounds a year come to this place.</t53>
<t54>––It would be useless if those twenty young people came and you didn't go to visit them.</t54>
<t55>––If it depends on that, dear, as soon as the twenty are here, I will visit them all.</t55>
<t56>Mr. Bennet was such a rare mixture of witty, sarcastic, reserved, and capricious that twenty-three years of experience had not been enough for his wife to understand his character.</t56> <t57>However, hers was less difficult; she was a woman of little intelligence, rather uneducated, and of uneven temperament.</t57> <t58>Her goal in life was to marry off her daughters; her consolation, visits and gossip.</t58>
<t59>CHAPTER II</t59>
<t60>Mr. Bennet was one of the first to pay his respects to Mr. Bingley.</t60> <t61>He always intended to visit him, although, in the end, he always assured his wife that he would not; and until the evening after his visit, his wife knew nothing about it.</t61> <t62>The matter came to light in the following way: observing how his daughter was putting on a hat, Mr. Bennet said:</t62>
<t63>––I hope Mr. Bingley likes it, Lizzy.</t63>
<t64>––How can we know what Mr. Bingley likes ––said his resentful wife–– if we haven't visited him yet?</t64>
<t65>––You forget, mom ––said Elizabeth–– that we will see him at the parties, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him to us.</t65>
<t66>––I don't believe Mrs. Long would do such a thing.</t66> <t67>She has two nieces to think about; she is selfish and hypocritical and does not deserve my trust.</t67>
<t68>––Nor is mine ––said Mr. Bennet–– and I am glad to know that you do not rely on her services.</t68> <t69>Mrs. Bennet did not deign to reply; but unable to contain herself, she began to scold one of her daughters.</t69>
<t70>––For the love of God, Kitty, stop coughing like that!</t70> <t71>Have mercy on my nerves.</t71> <t72>You are destroying them.</t72>
<t73>––Kitty is not at all discreet when coughing ––said her father––.</t73> <t74>She always does it at an inopportune moment.</t74>
<t75>––I don't find coughing amusing ––complained Kitty.</t75>
<t76>––When is your next dance, Lizzy?</t76>
<t77>––In fifteen days from tomorrow.</t77>
<t78>––Yes, that's right ––exclaimed the mother––.</t78> <t79>And Mrs. Long won't return until the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce us to Mr. Bingley, because she still won't know him.</t79>
<t80>––Then, Mrs. Bennet, you can get ahead of your friend and introduce him to her yourself.</t80>
<t81>––Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I don't know him either.</t81> <t82>Why are you mocking me?</t82>
<t83>––I commend your discretion.</t83> <t84>A friendship of fifteen days is truly very short.</t84> <t85>In reality, after only two weeks, one cannot really know what kind of man he is.</t85> <t86>But if we do not take the risk, others will.</t86> <t87>After all, Mrs. Long and her nieces can wait for their opportunity to present itself; but, nevertheless, as she will believe it to be an act of delicacy on her part to decline the attention, I will be the one to introduce him to you.</t87>
<t88>The girls stared at their father intently.</t88> <t89>Mrs. Bennet simply said:</t89>
<t90>––Nonsense, nonsense!</t90>
<t91>"––What does that emphatic exclamation mean? ––asked Mr. Bennet––."</t91> <t92>"Do you consider the formalities of introduction as nonsense, given their importance?"</t92> <t93>"I do not agree with you on that."</t93> <t94>"What do you say, Mary?"</t94> <t95>"I know that you are a very thoughtful young woman, and that you read great books and summarize them."</t95>
<t96>Mary wanted to say something sensible, but she didn't know how.</t96>
<t97>––While Mary clarifies her thoughts ––he continued––, let's return to Mr. Bingley.</t97>
<t98>––I'm fed up with Mr. Bingley! ––shouted his wife.</t98>
<t99>––I'm very sorry to hear that; why didn't you tell me earlier?</t99> <t100>If I had known this morning, I wouldn't have gone to their house.</t100> <t101>Bad luck!</t101> <t102>But since I have already visited them, we cannot give up their friendship now.</t102>
<t103>The astonishment of the ladies was precisely what he desired; perhaps Mrs. Bennet's surpassed the rest; although once the commotion caused by the joy was over, she declared that deep down it was what she had always imagined.</t103>
<t104>––My dear Mr. Bennet, how good you are!</t104> <t105>But I knew that in the end I would convince you.</t105> <t106>I was sure that you love your daughters enough not to neglect this matter.</t106> <t107>How happy I am!</t107> <t108>And what a funny joke, that you went this morning and didn't tell us anything until now!</t108>
<t109>––Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you want ––said Mr. Bennet; and he left the room, tired by his wife's enthusiasm.</t109>
<t110>––What an excellent father you have, daughters! ––she said once the door was closed––.</t110> <t111>I don't know how you will ever be able to thank him for his kindness, nor do I, for that matter.</t111> <t112>At this point, I assure you that it is not pleasant to make new acquaintances every day.</t112> <t113>But for you, we would do anything.</t113> <t114>Lydia, dear, even though you are the youngest, I would bet that Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.</t114>
<t115>––I am calm ––said Lydia firmly––, because although I am the youngest, I am the tallest.</t115>
<t116>The rest of the afternoon was spent making guesses about whether Mr. Bingley would soon return Mr. Bennet's visit, and deciding when they could invite him to dinner.</t116>
<t117>CHAPTER III</t117>
<t118>No matter how much Mrs. Bennet, with the help of her daughters, inquired about the matter, she could not get any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley from her husband.</t118> <t119>They attacked him in various ways: with very clear questions, clever suppositions, and hints; but no matter how skillful they were, he evaded them all.</t119> <t120>And in the end, they were forced to accept second-hand information from their neighbor Lady Lucas.</t120> <t121>Her impression was very favorable, Sir William had been delighted with him.</t121> <t122>He was young, very handsome, extremely pleasant, and to top it off, he planned to attend the next ball with a group of friends.</t122> <t123>There could be nothing better.</t123> <t124>His fondness for dancing was truly an advantage when it came to falling in love; and thus, lively hopes were kindled to win Mr. Bingley's heart.</t124>
<t125>––If I could see one of my daughters living happily in Netherfield, and the others equally well married, I would desire nothing more in life––said Mrs. Bennet to her husband.</t125>
<t126>A few days later, Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit and spent ten minutes with him in his library.</t126> <t127>He had hoped to be allowed to see the young ladies whose beauty he had heard so much about; but he saw no one but the father.</t127> <t128>The ladies were a bit more fortunate, as they had the advantage of being able to observe from a high window that Mr. Bingley wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.</t128>
<t129>Shortly afterwards, they sent him an invitation to come to dinner.</t129> <t130>And when Mrs. Bennet had already planned the dishes that would credit her good housekeeping, they received a response that ruined everything.</t130> <t131>Mr. Bingley was obliged to go to town the next day, and consequently could not accept the honor of their invitation.</t131> <t132>Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted.</t132> <t133>She could not imagine what business called him to town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he would always be flitting about without settling down properly and as expected at Netherfield.</t133> <t134>Lady Lucas somewhat allayed her fears by concluding that he was only going to London to gather a group of friends for the party.</t134> <t135>And soon the rumor spread that Bingley was going to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen for the ball.</t135> <t136>The girls were distressed by such a number of ladies; but the day before the ball, they were consoled to hear that instead of twelve, he had brought only six, five sisters and a cousin.</t136> <t137>And when the day of the ball arrived and they entered the hall, there were only five in total: Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.</t137>
<t138>Mr. Bingley was handsome, had the appearance of a gentleman, a pleasant countenance, and simple, unaffected manners.</t138> <t139>His sisters were beautiful women of undeniable elegance.</t139> <t140>His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, hardly had the appearance of a gentleman; but it was his friend Mr. Darcy who soon drew the attention of the room with his distinguished personality. He was a tall man, with handsome features and an aristocratic bearing.</t140> <t141>A few minutes after his entrance, a rumor was already circulating that his income was ten thousand pounds a year.</t141> <t142>The gentlemen declared that he was a man of great class; the ladies said he was much more handsome than Bingley, and he was admired for almost half the evening, until his manners caused such displeasure that they changed the course of his good reputation; it was discovered that he was a proud man, who pretended to be above everyone else and showed his dissatisfaction with the environment around him; not even his extensive estates in Derbyshire could save him from appearing odious and unpleasant, and from being considered worthless compared to his friend.</t142>
<t143>Mr. Bingley immediately made friends with the main people in the room; he was lively and frank, did not miss a single dance, regretted that the party ended so early, and spoke of giving one himself at Netherfield.</t143> <t144>Such pleasant qualities spoke for themselves.</t144> <t145>What a difference between him and his friend!</t145> <t146>Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, refused to be introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the night wandering around the room and occasionally talking to some of his companions.</t146> <t147>His character was definitively judged.</t147> <t148>He was the proudest and most disagreeable man in the world, and everyone hoped he would not return there again.</t148> <t149>Among those most offended by Darcy was Mrs. Bennet, whose displeasure at his behavior had intensified, turning into a personal offense for having slighted one of her daughters.</t149>
<t150>There were so few gentlemen that Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged to sit down during two dances; during that time, Darcy was close enough to her for the young lady to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who left the dance for a few minutes to persuade his friend to join them.</t150>
<t151>––Come, Darcy ––she said to him––, you have to dance.</t151> <t152>I can't stand seeing you standing there alone with that stupid attitude.</t152> <t153>It's better if you dance.</t153>
<t154>––I don't intend to do it.</t154> <t155>You know how much I hate it, unless I personally know my partner.</t155> <t156>At a party like this, it would be impossible for me.</t156> <t157>Your sisters are engaged, and dancing with any other woman in this room would be like a punishment for me.</t157>
<t158>––You shouldn't be so demanding and fussy ––complained Bingley––.</t158> <t159>For heaven's sake!</t159> <t160>Honestly, I've never seen so many charming girls as tonight; and there are some who are especially pretty.</t160>
<t161>––You are dancing with the only pretty girl in the room ––said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest of the Bennet sisters.</t161>
<t162>––Oh!</t162> <t163>She is the most beautiful creature I have ever seen in my life!</t163> <t164>But right behind you is sitting one of her sisters who is very pretty and I would bet very nice.</t164> <t165>Let me ask my partner to introduce you to her.</t165>
<t166>––What are you saying? ––and, turning around, he looked at Elizabeth for a moment, until their gazes met, he immediately looked away and said coldly: ––She is not bad, although she is not pretty enough to tempt me; and I am not in the mood to pay attention to young women who have been turned down by others.</t166> <t167>It is better that you return to your partner and enjoy their smiles because you are wasting your time with me.</t167>
<t168>Mr. Bingley followed his advice.</t168> <t169>Mr. Darcy walked away; and Elizabeth was left there with her not very cordial feelings towards him.</t169> <t170>However, she recounted the story to her friends with much humor because it was funny and very cheerful, and she had a certain disposition to make ridiculous things amusing.</t170>
<t171>In short, the evening passed pleasantly for the whole family.</t171> <t172>Mrs. Bennet saw how her eldest daughter had been admired by those from Netherfield.</t172> <t173>Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and his sisters were very attentive to her.</t173> <t174>Jane was as satisfied as, if not more than, her mother, but she kept it to herself.</t174> <t175>Elizabeth was happy for Jane.</t175> <t176>Mary had heard Miss Bingley say that she was the most cultured girl in the neighborhood.</t176> <t177>And Catherine and Lydia had the good fortune of never being without a partner, which, as they had been taught, was the only thing they should worry about at dances.</t177> <t178>So they returned happily to Longbourn, the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants.</t178> <t179>They found Mr. Bennet still up; with a book in front of him, he lost track of time; and on this occasion, he was very curious about the events of the night that had aroused so much expectation.</t179> <t180>He came to believe that his wife's opinion of the newcomer might be unfavorable; but he soon realized that what he was about to hear was quite the opposite.</t180>
<t181>––Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet ––said his wife as she entered the room––.</t181> <t182>We had a delightful evening, the ball was splendid.</t182> <t183>I would have liked you to be there.</t183> <t184>Jane aroused such admiration, nothing like it had ever been seen.</t184> <t185>Everyone was commenting on how beautiful she looked, and Mr. Bingley found her gorgeous and danced with her twice.</t185> <t186>Just imagine, dear; he danced with her twice.</t186> <t187>She was the only one in the entire hall he asked to dance a second time.</t187> <t188>The first one he asked was Miss Lucas.</t188> <t189>It quite upset me to see him dance with her, but he didn't like it at all.</t189> <t190>Who could like her, don't you think?</t190> <t191>However, he seemed to be captivated by Jane when he saw her dance.</t191> <t192>So he asked who she was, they introduced her to him, and he asked her for the next dance.</t192> <t193>Then he danced the third with Miss King, the fourth with Maria Lucas, the fifth again with Jane, the sixth with Lizzy, and the boulanger...</t193>
<t194>––If she had had any compassion for me ––shouted the impatient husband–– she wouldn't have spent so much!</t194> <t195>For the love of God, don't talk to me anymore about her partners!</t195> <t196>I wish she had twisted an ankle at the first dance!</t196>
<t197>––Oh, my dear!</t197> <t198>He has me fascinated, he is incredibly handsome, and his sisters are charming.</t198> <t199>They wore the most elegant dresses I have ever seen in my life.</t199> <t200>The lace on Mrs. Hurst's...</t200>
<t201>Here she was interrupted again.</t201> <t202>Mr. Bennet protested against any description of attire.</t202> <t203>Therefore, she was forced to move on to another chapter of the story, and recounted, with great bitterness and some exaggeration, the scandalous rudeness of Mr. Darcy.</t203>
<t204>––But I can assure you ––he added–– that Lizzy doesn't lose much by not being his type, because he is the most unpleasant and horrible man that exists, and he doesn't deserve anyone's sympathy.</t204> <t205>He is so stiff and so conceited that there is no way to tolerate him.</t205> <t206>He did nothing but strut from one side to the other like a peacock.</t206> <t207>He's not even handsome enough to be worth dancing with.</t207> <t208>I would have liked you to have been there and given him a good lesson.</t208> <t209>I detest him.</t209>
<t210>CHAPTER IV</t210>
<t211>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in praising Mr. Bingley, expressed to her sister how much she admired him.</t211>
<t212>––He is everything a young man should be ––she said––, sensible, cheerful, with a sense of humor; I had never seen such relaxed manners, so much naturalness with such perfect education.</t212>
<t213>––And he is also handsome ––replied Elizabeth––, which is never a bad thing in a young man.</t213> <t214>So he is a complete man.</t214>
<t215>––I felt very flattered when he asked me to dance for the second time.</t215> <t216>I didn't expect such a compliment.</t216>
<t217>––Didn't you expect it?</t217> <t218>I did.</t218> <t219>That is the big difference between us.</t219> <t220>Compliments always catch you by surprise, but never me.</t220> <t221>It was the most natural thing for him to ask you to dance for the second time.</t221> <t222>It couldn't have escaped his notice that you were five times more beautiful than all the other women in the room.</t222> <t223>Don't thank him for his gallantry because of that.</t223> <t224>Well, the truth is that he is very pleasant, I approve of you liking him.</t224> <t225>You have liked many stupid people.</t225>
<t226>––Lizzy, dear!</t226>
<t227>––Oh! You know perfectly well that you have a certain tendency to like everyone.</t227> <t228>You never see a flaw in anyone.</t228> <t229>Everyone is good and pleasant in your eyes.</t229> <t230>I have never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.</t230>
<t231>––I would not want to be imprudent in criticizing someone; but I always say what I think.</t231>
<t232>––I already know; and that's what makes it amazing.</t232> <t233>To be so blind to the follies and foolishness of others, with the good sense you have.</t233> <t234>Pretending candor is quite common, you see it everywhere.</t234> <t235>But to be candid without ostentation or premeditation, to take the good from everyone, improve it even, and say nothing of the bad, only you do that.</t235> <t236>And you also like his sisters, don't you?</t236> <t237>Their manners are nothing like his.</t237>
<t238>––At first, of course not, but when you talk to them, they are very kind.</t238> <t239>Miss Bingley is going to come live with her brother and take care of his house.</t239> <t240>And, unless I am very much mistaken, I am sure we will find in her a charming neighbor.</t240>
<t241>Elizabeth listened in silence, but she was not convinced.</t241> <t242>The behavior of Bingley's sisters had not been intended to please anyone.</t242> <t243>A better observer than her sister, with a less flexible temperament and a judgment less prone to being influenced by flattery, Elizabeth was unwilling to approve of the Bingleys.</t243> <t244>They were, indeed, very fine ladies, quite cheerful when not contradicted and, when they wanted to be, very pleasant; but proud and conceited.</t244> <t245>They were quite pretty; they had been educated at one of the best schools in the capital and possessed a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; they were accustomed to overspending and associating with people of rank, which made them believe they had the right to hold a good opinion of themselves and a poor opinion of others.</t245> <t246>They belonged to an honorable family from the north of England, a fact that was more deeply ingrained in their memory than the fact that both their fortune and their brother's had been made in trade.</t246>
<t247>Mr. Bingley inherited nearly one hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had already intended to buy a mansion but did not live to do so.</t247> <t248>Mr. Bingley thought the same way and sometimes seemed determined to make the choice within his county; but as he now had a good house and the freedom of a property owner, those who knew his calm character well doubted that he would not spend the rest of his days in Netherfield and leave the purchase for the next generation.</t248>
<t249>His sisters were eager for him to have a mansion of his own.</t249> <t250>But although he was currently nothing more than a tenant, Miss Bingley was still eager to preside over his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man more elegant than wealthy, any less willing to consider her brother's house as her own whenever it suited her.</t250>
<t251>Two short years after Mr. Bingley had come of age, a casual recommendation induced him to visit the Netherfield estate.</t251> <t252>He viewed it inside and out for half an hour and was satisfied with the owner's praises, renting it immediately.</t252>
<t253>Between him and Darcy, there existed a firm friendship despite having such opposite characters.</t253> <t254>Bingley had gained Darcy's sympathy due to his open and docile temperament and his naturalness, even though there was no way of being that offered a greater contrast to his own, and even though he seemed very satisfied with his character.</t254> <t255>Bingley knew the respect that Darcy had for him, which is why he trusted him completely, as well as his good judgment.</t255> <t256>He understood Darcy like no one else.</t256> <t257>Bingley was not at all foolish, but Darcy was much more intelligent.</t257> <t258>He was at the same time arrogant, reserved, and picky, and although he was very polite, his manners did not make him at all attractive.</t258> <t259>In this regard, his friend had all the advantage; Bingley was sure to be liked wherever he went, whereas Darcy was always offensive.</t259>
<t260>The best example is the way they talked about the Meryton party.</t260> <t261>Bingley had never met more charming people or prettier girls in his life; everyone had been extremely kind and attentive to him, there had been no formalities or stiffness, and he soon became friends with the whole room; and as for Miss Bennet, he couldn't conceive of an angel who was more beautiful.</t261> <t262>On the contrary, Darcy had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no elegance, he had felt the slightest interest in none of them, and had received no attention or pleasure from any of them.</t262> <t263>He acknowledged that Miss Bennet was beautiful, but she smiled too much.</t263> <t264>Mrs. Hurst and her sister admitted it, but still liked and admired her, they said she was a very sweet girl and that they would not mind getting to know her better.</t264> <t265>It was established, then, that Miss Bennet was a very sweet girl and for this reason the brother felt authorized to think of her as and when he wanted.</t265>
<t266>CHAPTER V</t266>
<t267>A short distance from Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets had a special friendship.</t267> <t268>Sir William Lucas had previously been in business in Meryton, where he had made a modest fortune and had been elevated to the rank of knight by petition to the king during his mayoralty.</t268> <t269>This distinction had gone a bit to his head, and he began to dislike having to engage in business and live in a small commercial town; so, leaving both behind, he moved with his family to a house a mile from Meryton, henceforth called Lucas Lodge, where he could indulge in thinking with pleasure about his own importance, and, detached from his business, occupy himself solely with being kind to everyone.</t269> <t270>For although he was proud of his rank, he had not become conceited; on the contrary, he was all attentiveness to everyone.</t270> <t271>Of an inoffensive, sociable, and helpful nature, his presentation at St. James had also made him courteous.</t271>
<t272>Mrs. Lucas was a good woman, although not intelligent enough for Mrs. Bennet to consider her a valuable neighbor.</t272> <t273>They had several children.</t273> <t274>The eldest, an intelligent and sensible young woman of about twenty years, was Elizabeth's close friend.</t274>
<t275>That the Lucases and the Bennets should gather to chat after a ball was absolutely necessary, and the morning after the party, the Lucases went to Longbourn to exchange impressions.</t275>
<t276>––You started the night well, Charlotte ––said Mrs. Bennet, feigning all possible kindness towards Miss Lucas––.</t276> <t277>You were the first one Mr. Bingley chose.</t277>
<t278>––Yes, but she seemed to like the second one more.</t278>
<t279>––Oh!</t279> <t280>You mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice.</t280> <t281>Yes, it seems he liked her; yes, I think so.</t281> <t282>I heard something, I don't know, something about Mr. Robinson.</t282>
<t283>––Perhaps it refers to what I heard between him and Mr. Robinson, haven't I told you?</t283> <t284>Mr. Robinson asked him if he liked the Meryton parties, if he didn't think there were very beautiful girls in the hall, and which one seemed the prettiest of all to him.</t284> <t285>His answer to this last question was immediate: "The eldest of the Bennets, without a doubt.</t285> <t286>There can be only one opinion on that matter."</t286>
<t287>––Don't tell me!</t287> <t288>It seems determined to...</t288> <t289>It's as if...</t289> <t290>But, in the end, everything could come to nothing.</t290>
<t291>––What I heard was better than what you heard, right, Elizabeth? ––said Charlotte––.</t291> <t292>It's more worthwhile to listen to Mr. Bingley than to Mr. Darcy, don't you think? Poor Eliza!</t292> <t293>To only say: "Not bad.</t293> <t294>"</t294>
<t295>––I beg you not to put it into Lizzy's head to be upset about Darcy.</t295> <t296>He is such an unpleasant man that it would be a misfortune to like him.</t296> <t297>Mrs. Long told me that he had been sitting next to her and hadn't opened his mouth.</t297>
<t298>––Are you sure, Mom? Aren't you mistaken?</t298> <t299>I saw Mr. Darcy talking to her.</t299>
<t300>––Yes, of course; because she eventually asked him if he liked Netherfield, and he had no choice but to answer; but Mrs. Long said that he was not at all pleased that she spoke to him.</t300>
<t301>––Miss Bingley told me ––commented Jane that he did not usually talk much, except with his close friends.</t301> <t302>With them, he is incredibly pleasant.</t302>
<t303>––I don't believe a word of it, dear.</t303> <t304>If he were so pleasant, he would have talked to Mrs. Long.</t304> <t305>But I can already imagine what happened.</t305> <t306>Everyone says that his pride knows no bounds, and I would bet that he heard that Mrs. Long doesn't have a carriage and that she went to the ball in a rented one.</t306>
<t307>––I don't mind that he didn't speak with Mrs. Long ––said Miss Lucas––, but I wish he had danced with Eliza.</t307>
<t308>––If I were you, Lizzy ––added the mother––, I would never dance with him again.</t308>
<t309>––I believe, mom, that I can promise you that I will never dance with him.</t309>
<t310>––Pride ––said Miss Lucas–– always offends, but his pride doesn't seem so offensive to me.</t310> <t311>He has an excuse.</t311> <t312>It is natural for an attractive man, with family, fortune, and everything in his favor to have a high opinion of himself.</t312> <t313>In a way, he has the right to be proud.</t313>
<t314>––It is very true ––replied Elizabeth––, I could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine.</t314>
<t315>––Pride ––observed Mary, who prided herself greatly on the solidity of her reflections––, is a very common defect.</t315> <t316>From all that I have read, I am convinced that it is indeed very frequent for human nature to be especially prone to it; there are very few who do not harbor a feeling of self-sufficiency for one reason or another, whether real or imagined.</t316> <t317>Vanity and pride are different things, although they are often used as synonyms.</t317> <t318>Pride relates to the opinion we have of ourselves; vanity, to what we would like others to think of us.</t318>
<t319>––If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy, exclaimed a young Lucas who had come with his sisters––, I wouldn't mind being proud.</t319> <t320>I would have a pack of hunting dogs, and I would drink a bottle of wine a day.</t320>
<t321>––Well, you would drink much more than you should ––said Mrs. Bennet–– and if I saw you, I would take the bottle away from you immediately.</t321>
<t322>The boy said he wouldn't dare, she said she would, and so they kept arguing until the visit was concluded.</t322>
<t323>CHAPTER VI</t323>
<t324>The ladies of Longbourn soon went to visit those of Netherfield, and the latter returned the visit as is customary.</t324> <t325>The charm of Miss Bennet increased the esteem that Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley felt for her; and although they found the mother intolerable and not worth speaking to the younger sisters, they expressed a desire to deepen their relations with them out of regard for the two eldest.</t325> <t326>This attention was received by Jane with pleasure, but Elizabeth continued to see arrogance in their treatment of everyone, except, with reservations, her sister; she could not like them.</t326> <t327>Although she valued their kindness to Jane, she knew it was probably due to the influence of the admiration the brother felt for her.</t327> <t328>It was evident, wherever they met, that Bingley admired Jane; and it was also evident to Elizabeth that in her sister increased the inclination she felt for him from the beginning, which predisposed her to fall in love with him; but she realized, with great satisfaction, that people could not notice it, since Jane would combine the strength of her feelings with moderation and a constant joviality, which would drive away the suspicions of the impertinent.</t328> <t329>She commented this to her friend, Miss Lucas.</t329>
<t330>––Perhaps it is better in this case ––replied Charlotte–– to be able to escape people's curiosity; but sometimes it is bad to be so reserved.</t330> <t331>If a woman conceals her affection for its object, she may lose the opportunity to win him over; and then it is a poor consolation to think that others are equally ignorant.</t331> <t332>There is so much gratitude and vanity in almost all affections that it is not at all convenient to leave them adrift.</t332> <t333>Normally we all start with a slight preference, and that can simply be for no reason; but there are very few who have enough heart to fall in love without having been encouraged.</t333> <t334>In nine out of ten cases, a woman must show more affection than she feels.</t334> <t335>Bingley likes your sister, undoubtedly; but if she does not help him, it will go no further.</t335>
<t336>––She helps him as much as his nature allows.</t336> <t337>If I can notice her affection towards him, he, certainly, would be foolish not to discover it.</t337>
<t338>––Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's character as you do.</t338>
<t339>––But if a woman is interested in a man and does not try to hide it, he will eventually have to find out.</t339>
<t340>––Maybe so, if he sees her enough.</t340> <t341>But although Bingley and Jane are often together, it is never for long; and besides, since they only see each other at crowded parties, they cannot talk alone.</t341> <t342>So Jane should make the most of every minute she can catch his attention.</t342> <t343>And when she has him for sure, she will have time––to fall in love with him as much as she wants.</t343>
<t344>––Your plan is good ––replied Elizabeth––, when the matter is only about marrying well; and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I can almost say that I would carry it out.</t344> <t345>But those are not Jane's feelings, she does not act with premeditation.</t345> <t346>She still cannot be sure to what extent she likes him, nor why.</t346> <t347>She has only known him for fifteen days.</t347> <t348>She danced with him four times in Meryton; saw him one morning at her house, and since then has dined in his company four times.</t348> <t349>This is not enough for her to know his character.</t349>
<t350>––Not as you put it.</t350> <t351>If I had only had dinner with him, I wouldn't have discovered anything other than whether he has a good appetite or not; but you mustn't forget that they spent four evenings together; and four evenings can mean quite a lot.</t351>
<t352>––Yes; in those four evenings, all they could do was find out what kind of dances each one liked, but I don't think they were able to discover the really important things about their character.</t352>
<t353>––Well ––said Charlotte––.</t353> <t354>I wholeheartedly wish that things go well for Jane; and if she were to marry him tomorrow, I believe she would have a better chance of being happy than if she spends twelve months studying his character.</t354> <t355>Happiness in marriage is only a matter of luck.</t355> <t356>The belief that a couple is equal or knows each other well beforehand is not going to bring them happiness at all.</t356> <t357>The differences become more and more pronounced until they become unbearable; it is always better to know as little as possible about the person with whom you are going to share your life.</t357>
<t358>––You make me laugh, Charlotte; it doesn't make sense.</t358> <t359>You know it doesn't make sense; besides, you would never act that way.</t359>
<t360>Occupied with observing Bingley's attentions towards her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was also the object of interest in the eyes of Bingley's friend.</t360> <t361>At first, Mr. Darcy barely deigned to admit that she was pretty; he had shown no admiration for her at the ball; and the next time they met, he only noticed her to criticize her.</t361> <t362>But as soon as he made it clear to himself and to his friends that he barely liked her facial features, he began to realize that the beautiful expression of her dark eyes gave her an air of extraordinary intelligence.</t362> <t363>This discovery was followed by others equally mortifying.</t363> <t364>Although he detected with a critical eye more than one flaw in the perfect symmetry of her form, he had to acknowledge that her figure was graceful and slender; and despite claiming that her manners were not those of refined people, he felt attracted to her naturalness and cheerfulness.</t364> <t365>She had not the slightest idea of this matter.</t365> <t366>To her, Darcy was the man who made himself disagreeable wherever he went and the man who had not considered her beautiful enough to ask her to dance.</t366>
<t367>Darcy began to want to get to know her better.</t367> <t368>As a preliminary step to talking to her, he dedicated himself to listening to her talk with others.</t368> <t369>This fact caught Elizabeth's attention.</t369> <t370>It happened one day at Sir Lucas's house where a large group of people had gathered.</t370>
<t371>––What could Mr. Darcy want ––she said to Charlotte––, as he has been listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?</t371>
<t372>––That is a question that only Mr. Darcy can answer.</t372>
<t373>––If he does it again, I will let him know that I understand what he intends.</t373> <t374>He is very satirical, and if I don't start by being impertinent myself, I will end up being afraid of him.</t374>
<t375>Shortly afterward, he approached them again, and although he did not seem to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas challenged her friend to bring up the subject, which immediately prompted Elizabeth, who turned to him and said:</t375>
<t376>––Don't you think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself very well a moment ago when I insisted to Colonel Forster that he give us a ball in Meryton?</t376>
<t377>––With great energy; but that is a topic that always fills women with energy.</t377>
<t378>––You are strict with us.</t378>
<t379>––Now it's our turn to insist to you ––said Miss Lucas––.</t379> <t380>I'm going to open the piano and you know what comes next, Eliza.</t380>
<t381>––What kind of friend are you?</t381> <t382>You always want me to sing and play in front of everyone.</t382> <t383>If God had called me to the path of music, you would be a friend of incalculable value; but since that is not the case, I would prefer not to play in front of people who must be used to listening to the best musicians ––but as Miss Lucas insisted, she added––: Very well, if it must be, it will be ––and looking coldly at Darcy, she said––:</t383> <t384>There is an old saying that everyone here knows very well, "save your breath to cool your soup," and I will save mine for my song.</t384>
<t385>Elizabeth's concert was pleasant, but not extraordinary.</t385> <t386>After one or two songs and before she could satisfy the requests of some who wanted her to sing again, she was replaced at the piano by her sister Mary, who, being the least brilliant of the family, worked hard to acquire knowledge and skills that she was always eager to demonstrate.</t386>
<t387>Mary had neither talent nor taste; and although vanity had made her diligent, it had also given her a pedantic air and affected manners that would mar any brilliance superior to what she had achieved.</t387> <t388>Elizabeth, although she had played only half as well, had been listened to with more pleasure because of her ease and simplicity; Mary, at the end of her long concert, received no more than a few compliments for the Scottish and Irish melodies she had played at the request of her younger sisters who, along with some of the Lucases and two or three officers, were dancing merrily at one end of the room.</t388>
<t389>Darcy, who was indignant at that way of spending the evening, was silent and not in the mood to talk; he was so absorbed in his own thoughts that he did not notice Sir William Lucas was beside him until the latter addressed him.</t389>
<t390>––What a delightful amusement for the youth, Mr. Darcy!</t390> <t391>When you look at it closely, there is nothing like dancing.</t391> <t392>I consider it one of the finest refinements of the most distinguished societies.</t392>
<t393>––Certainly, sir, and it also has the advantage of being fashionable among the less distinguished societies of the world; all the savages dance.</t393>
<t394>Sir William sketched a smile.</t394>
<t395>––Your friend dances wonderfully ––she continued after a pause, seeing Bingley join the group–– and I do not doubt, Mr. Darcy, that you yourself are an expert in the matter.</t395>
<t396>––He saw me dance in Meryton, I believe, sir.</t396>
<t397>––Of course, and it gave me great pleasure to see him.</t397> <t398>Do you often dance at Saint James?</t398>
<t399>––Never, sir.</t399>
<t400>––Don't you think it would be a compliment to that place?</t400>
<t401>––It is a compliment that I never give anywhere, if I can avoid it.</t401>
<t402>––I believe he has a house in the capital.</t402> <t403>Mr. Darcy nodded his head.</t403>
<t404>––I sometimes thought about settling in the city, because I love high society; but I wasn't sure if the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.</t404>
<t405>Sir William paused in the hope of a response, but his company was not willing to make any.</t405> <t406>Seeing Elizabeth approaching, it occurred to him to do something that seemed very gallant on his part, and he called her.</t406>
<t407>––My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?</t407> <t408>Mr. Darcy, allow me to introduce you to this young lady who could be an excellent partner.</t408> <t409>I am sure you cannot refuse to dance when you have such beauty before you.</t409>
<t410>He took Elizabeth by the hand with the intention of giving her to Darcy; who, although extremely surprised, was not going to refuse her; but Elizabeth turned her back on him and said to Sir William, somewhat disconcerted:</t410>
<t411>––Really, sir, I had no intention of dancing.</t411> <t412>I beg you not to assume that I came here to find a partner.</t412>
<t413>Mr. Darcy, with all propriety, asked her to grant him the honor of dancing with him, but it was in vain.</t413> <t414>Elizabeth was determined, and not even Sir William, with all his arguments, could persuade her.</t414>
<t415>––You are excellent at dancing, Miss Eliza, and it is very cruel of you to deny me the satisfaction of watching you; and although this gentleman does not like this entertainment, I am sure he would not mind indulging us for half an hour.</t415>
<t416>––Mr. Darcy is very polite ––said Elizabeth, smiling.</t416>
<t417>––It is indeed; but considering what induces him, dear Eliza, we cannot doubt his courtesy; because, who could reject such a charming couple?</t417>
<t418>Elizabeth looked at them coquettishly and withdrew.</t418> <t419>Her resistance had not harmed her at all in the eyes of the gentleman, who was thinking of her with satisfaction when he was approached by Miss Bingley.</t419>
<t420>––I guess why you are so thoughtful.</t420>
<t421>––I don't think so.</t421>
<t422>––He is thinking about how unbearable it would be to spend more evenings like this, in a society like this; and of course, I share his opinion.</t422> <t423>I have never been angrier.</t423> <t424>What insipid people and what a fuss they make!</t424> <t425>How insignificant they are and yet how important they think they are.</t425> <t426>I would give anything to hear their criticisms about them.</t426>
<t427>––His conjectures are completely wrong.</t427> <t428>My mind was occupied with more pleasant things.</t428> <t429>I was meditating on the great pleasure that a pair of beautiful eyes on the face of a lovely woman can cause.</t429>
<t430>Miss Bingley stared at him, wishing he would tell her which lady had inspired such thoughts.</t430> <t431>Mr. Darcy, undaunted, replied:</t431>
<t432>––Miss Elizabeth Bennet.</t432>
<t433>––Miss Bennet!</t433> <t434>You astonish me.</t434> <t435>Since when is she your favorite?</t435> <t436>And tell me, when will I have to congratulate you?</t436>
<t437>––That is exactly the question I was expecting you to ask me.</t437> <t438>A lady's imagination moves very quickly and jumps from admiration to love and from love to marriage in a moment.</t438> <t439>I knew you would congratulate me.</t439>
<t440>––If you take it so seriously, I will believe it is already a done deal.</t440> <t441>You will have a charming mother-in-law, truly, and needless to say, she will always be at Pemberley with you.</t441>
<t442>He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she continued to enjoy the things she was saying; and seeing, by Darcy's attitude, that everything was safe, she let her wit flow for a long time.</t442>
<t443>CHAPTER VII</t443>
<t444>Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely of an estate of two thousand pounds a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was destined, due to the lack of male heirs, to a distant relative; and the fortune of their mother, although ample for her position, could hardly supplement that of her husband.</t444> <t445>Her father had been a lawyer in Meryton and had left her four thousand pounds.</t445>
<t446>Mrs. Bennet had a sister married to a certain Mr. Phillips who had been employed by her father and had succeeded him in business, and a brother in London who held a respectable position in trade.</t446>
<t447>The village of Longbourn was only a mile from Meryton, a very convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted to go there three or four times a week to visit their aunt and, incidentally, stop by a millinery shop near her house.</t447> <t448>The ones who frequented Meryton the most were the two youngest, Catherine and Lydia, who tended to be more idle than their sisters, and when nothing better was offered, they decided that a little walk to town was necessary to pass the morning well and thus have conversation for the afternoon; because, although news was not usually abundant in the countryside, their aunt always had something to tell.</t448> <t449>At the moment, they were well supplied with gossip and joy at the recent arrival of a military regiment that was going to stay all winter and had its headquarters in Meryton.</t449>
<t450>Now the visits to Mrs. Phillips provided the most interesting information.</t450> <t451>Each day they added something more to what they already knew about the names and families of the officers.</t451> <t452>The place where they were staying was no longer a secret and soon they began to meet the officers in person.</t452>
<t453>Mr. Phillips knew them all, which was an unexpected source of satisfaction for his nieces.</t453> <t454>He spoke of nothing but officers.</t454> <t455>Mr. Bingley's great fortune, which his mother so loved to talk about, was no longer worth comparing to the uniform of an ensign.</t455>
<t456>After hearing one morning the enthusiasm with which his daughters spoke about the subject, Mr. Bennet observed coldly:</t456>
<t457>––From everything I can make out from the way you talk, you must be the silliest girls in the whole country.</t457> <t458>I had my suspicions sometimes, but now I am convinced.</t458>
<t459>Catherine was left bewildered and did not reply.</t459> <t460>Lydia, with complete indifference, continued to express her admiration for Captain Carter and said that she hoped to see him that very day, as he was leaving for London the next morning.</t460>
<t461>––I am astonished, dear ––said Mrs. Bennet––, at how ready you always are to believe that your daughters are foolish.</t461> <t462>If I were to look down on anyone, it would be the daughters of others, not my own.</t462>
<t463>––If my daughters are foolish, the least I can do is acknowledge it.</t463>
<t464>––Yes, but you see, it turns out they are very smart.</t464>
<t465>––I presume that is the only point on which we disagree.</t465> <t466>I always wished to agree with you on everything, but on this I differ, because our two younger daughters are complete fools.</t466>
<t467>My dear Mr. Bennet, you cannot expect these girls to have as much sense as their parents.</t467> <t468>When they are our age, I would bet that they think about officers as much as we do.</t468> <t469>I remember a time when I was very fond of a red coat, and the truth is that I still carry it in my heart.</t469> <t470>And if a young colonel with five or six thousand pounds a year wanted one of my daughters, I would not say no.</t470> <t471>I found Colonel Forster very well the other night at Sir William's house.</t471>
<t472>––Mom ––said Lydia, Aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter don't go to the Watsons' house as much as before.</t472> <t473>Now she sees them a lot at Clarke's library.</t473>
<t474>Mrs. Bennet could not answer as she was interrupted by the entrance of a footman who brought a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield and the servant awaited a reply.</t474> <t475>Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with joy and she was impatient for her daughter to finish reading.</t475>
<t476>––Well, Jane, whose is it? What is it about? What does it say?</t476> <t477>Hurry up and tell us, hurry up, darling.</t477>
<t478>––It is from Miss Bingley ––said Jane, and then she read aloud:</t478>
<t479>My dear friend,</t479>
<t480>If you have compassion for us, come to dinner today with Louisa and me, otherwise, we will be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, because two women together all day cannot end without fighting.</t480> <t481>Come as soon as possible after receiving this note.</t481> <t482>My brother and the other gentlemen will dine with the officers.</t482> <t483>Regards,</t483>
<t484>Caroline Bingley</t484>
<t485>––With the officers! ––exclaimed Lydia––.</t485> <t486>How strange that Aunt didn't tell us!</t486>
<t487>––Dinner out! ––said Mrs. Bennet––.</t487> <t488>What bad luck!</t488>
<t489>––Can I take the carriage? ––asked Jane.</t489>
<t490>––No, dear; it's better if you go on horseback, because it looks like it's going to rain and that way you'll have to stay the night.</t490>
<t491>––It would be a good plan ––said Elizabeth––, if you were sure they wouldn't offer to bring her home.</t491>
<t492>––Oh, the gentlemen will take Mr. Bingley's landau to Meryton and the Hursts do not have their own horses.</t492>
<t493>––I would prefer to go in the carriage.</t493>
<t494>––But dear, your father cannot lend you the horses.</t494> <t495>I am certain of it.</t495> <t496>They are needed on the farm.</t496> <t497>Isn't that right, Mr. Bennet?</t497>
<t498>––They are needed more on the farm than what I can offer them.</t498>
<t499>––If you can offer them today ––said Elizabeth––, my mother's wishes will be fulfilled.</t499>
<t500>In the end, he encouraged the father to admit that the horses were occupied.</t500> <t501>And, finally, Jane was forced to go on horseback.</t501> <t502>Her mother accompanied her to the door, very happily predicting a terrible day.</t502>
<t503>Their hopes were fulfilled; Jane had not been gone long when it started to pour rain.</t503> <t504>The sisters were worried about her, but their mother was delighted.</t504> <t505>It didn't stop raining all afternoon; it was obvious that Jane wouldn't be able to return...</t505>
<t506>––Truly, I had a very good idea ––repeated Mrs. Bennet.</t506>
<t507>However, it was not until the next morning that she knew anything about the result of her timely stratagem.</t507> <t508>She had barely finished breakfast when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:</t508>
<t509>My dear Lizzy:</t509>
<t510>I am not feeling very well this morning, which, I suppose, is because I got soaked to the bone yesterday.</t510> <t511>My kind friends do not want to hear about me going back home until I am better.</t511> <t512>They insist that I see Mr. Jones; therefore, do not be alarmed if you hear that he has come to visit me.</t512> <t513>I have nothing more than a sore throat and a headache.</t513> <t514>Yours always,</t514>
<t515>Jane</t515>
<t516>––Well, my dear ––said Mr. Bennet once Elizabeth had read the note aloud––, if Jane were to contract a dangerous illness or die, it would be a consolation to know that it was all to get Mr. Bingley and under your orders.</t516>
<t517>––Oh!</t517> <t518>I'm not afraid that she will die.</t518> <t519>People don't die from insignificant little colds.</t519> <t520>She will have good care.</t520> <t521>As long as she is there, everything will go wonderfully.</t521> <t522>I would go see her if I could use the car.</t522>
<t523>Elizabeth, who was truly worried, made up her mind to go see her.</t523> <t524>Since she couldn't have the carriage and wasn't a good rider, walking was her only option.</t524> <t525>And she announced her decision.</t525>
<t526>––How can you be so foolish? exclaimed her mother––.</t526> <t527>How can such a thing occur to you?</t527> <t528>With all the mud there is!</t528> <t529>You would arrive looking a mess, you wouldn't be presentable!</t529>
<t530>––I would be presentable to see Jane, which is all I desire.</t530>
<t531>––Is that a hint for me to send for the horses, Lizzy? ––said her father.</t531>
<t532>––No, not at all.</t532> <t533>I don't mind walking.</t533> <t534>There are no distances when you have a reason.</t534> <t535>It's only three miles.</t535> <t536>I'll be back by dinner time.</t536>
<t537>––I admire the activity of your benevolence ––observed Mary––; but every impulse of feeling must be guided by reason, and in my opinion, the effort must be proportional to what is intended.</t537>
<t538>––We will go with you to Meryton ––said Catherine and Lydia.</t538> <t539>Elizabeth accepted their company and the three young women went out together.</t539>
<t540>––If we hurry ––said Lydia as she walked––, maybe we can see Captain Carter before he leaves.</t540>
<t541>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest headed to the home of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued on her way alone.</t541> <t542>She crossed field after field at a brisk pace, jumped fences, and navigated puddles impatiently until she finally found herself in front of the house, with soaked ankles, dirty stockings, and a face flushed from the exercise.</t542>
<t543>They took her to the dining room where everyone was gathered except Jane, and where her presence caused great surprise.</t543> <t544>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley found it incredible that she had walked three miles alone, so early and in such dreadful weather.</t544> <t545>Elizabeth was convinced that they looked down on her for it.</t545> <t546>Nevertheless, they received her with much courtesy, but in the brother's attitude, there was something more than courtesy: there was good humor and kindness.</t546> <t547>Mr. Darcy spoke little and Mr. Hurst nothing at all.</t547> <t548>The former fluctuated between admiration for the brightness that exercise had given her face and doubt as to whether the occasion justified her having come alone from so far.</t548> <t549>The latter only thought about his breakfast.</t549>
<t550>The questions that Elizabeth asked about her sister were not answered favorably.</t550> <t551>Miss Bennet had slept poorly, and although she had gotten up, she had a high fever and was not in a condition to leave her room.</t551> <t552>Elizabeth was glad to be taken to see her immediately; and Jane, who had refrained from expressing in her note how much she desired that visit, for fear of being inconvenient or alarming them, was very happy to see her enter.</t552> <t553>Despite everything, she did not have the spirit for much conversation.</t553> <t554>When Miss Bingley left them alone, she could only express gratitude for the extraordinary kindness with which she was treated in that house.</t554> <t555>Elizabeth attended to her in silence.</t555>
<t556>When breakfast was over, the Bingley sisters joined them; and Elizabeth began to find them likable upon seeing the affection and interest they showed for Jane.</t556> <t557>The doctor came and examined the patient, declaring, as was to be expected, that she had caught a severe cold and that they should do everything possible to take care of her.</t557> <t558>He recommended that she get back into bed and prescribed some medicines.</t558> <t559>They followed the doctor's instructions to the letter, as the fever had increased and the headache was more severe.</t559> <t560>Elizabeth did not leave the room for a single moment, and the other ladies also did not stay away for long.</t560> <t561>The gentlemen were outside because they really had nothing to do there.</t561>
<t562>When it struck three, Elizabeth realized that she had to leave, and, although very much against her will, she expressed it as such.</t562>
<t563>Miss Bingley offered her the carriage; Elizabeth was only waiting for her to insist a little more to accept it, when Jane expressed her desire to leave with her; therefore, Miss Bingley was obliged to turn the offer of the landau into an invitation for her to stay at Netherfield.</t563> <t564>Elizabeth accepted very gratefully, and they sent a servant to Longbourn to inform the family that she was staying and to send her clothes.</t564>
<t565>CHAPTER VIII</t565>
<t566>At five o'clock, the ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six, they called Elizabeth to come down for dinner.</t566> <t567>She could not respond favorably to the attentive questions they asked her, in which she had the satisfaction of discerning Mr. Bingley's special interest.</t567> <t568>Jane had not improved at all; upon hearing this, the sisters repeated three or four times how sorry they were, how awful it was to have a bad cold, and how much they disliked being ill themselves.</t568> <t569>After that, they no longer concerned themselves with the matter.</t569> <t570>Their indifference towards Jane, as soon as she was out of sight, rekindled in Elizabeth the antipathy she had initially felt towards them.</t570>
<t571>In reality, Bingley was the only one in the group whom she viewed with favor.</t571> <t572>His concern for Jane was evident, and the attentions he paid to Elizabeth were what prevented her from feeling like an intruder, which was how the others regarded her.</t572> <t573>Only he seemed to notice her presence.</t573> <t574>Miss Bingley was absorbed with Mr. Darcy; her sister, more or less, the same; as for Mr. Hurst, who was seated next to Elizabeth, he was an indolent man who lived only to eat, drink, and play cards.</t574> <t575>When he learned that Elizabeth preferred a simple dish to a ragout, he had nothing more to talk about with her.</t575> <t576>When dinner was over, Elizabeth immediately returned to Jane.</t576> <t577>As soon as they left the dining room, Miss Bingley began to criticize her.</t577> <t578>Her manners were, indeed, terrible, a mix of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.</t578> <t579>Mrs. Hurst felt the same and added:</t579>
<t580>––In summary, the only thing that can be said about her is that she is an excellent walker.</t580> <t581>I will never forget how she appeared this morning.</t581> <t582>She really looked half-wild.</t582>
<t583>Indeed, Louisa.</t583> <t584>When I saw her, I could hardly contain myself.</t584> <t585>What folly to come all the way here!</t585> <t586>What need was there for her to run through the fields just because her sister has a cold?</t586> <t587>How she had her hair, so disheveled, so untidy!</t587>
<t588>––Yes.</t588> <t589>And the petticoats!</t589> <t590>If you had seen them!</t590> <t591>With more than a handspan of mud.</t591> <t592>And the coat she had put on to cover them, of course, did not fulfill its purpose.</t592>
<t593>––Your portrait may be very accurate, Louisa ––said Bingley––, but all of that went unnoticed by me.</t593> <t594>I think Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked impeccable when she entered the room this morning.</t594> <t595>I hardly noticed that her skirts were dirty.</t595>
<t596>––I am sure that you did notice, Mr. Darcy ––said Miss Bingley––; and I imagine that you would not like your sister to put on such a display.</t596>
<t597>––Of course not.</t597>
<t598>––To walk three miles, or four, or five, or however many, with mud up to your ankles and alone, completely alone!</t598> <t599>What could she mean by that?</t599> <t600>To me, that shows an abominable independence and presumption, and an indifference to the decorum typical of country folk.</t600>
<t601>––What it shows is a considerable affection for her sister ––said Bingley.</t601>
<t602>––I fear, Mr. Darcy ––observed Miss Bingley in a low voice––, that this adventure may have considerably affected the admiration you felt for her beautiful eyes.</t602>
<t603>––Not at all ––replied Darcy––; the exercise made them even brighter.</t603>
<t604>This intervention was followed by a brief pause, and Mrs. Hurst began again.</t604>
<t605>––I hold Jane Bennet in high regard, she is truly a charming girl, and I wish with all my heart that she has much luck.</t605> <t606>But with such parents and relatives of such low class, I fear she will not have many opportunities.</t606>
<t607>––I believe I heard you say that his uncle is a lawyer in Meryton.</t607>
<t608>––Yes, and he has another one who lives somewhere near Cheapside.</t608>
<t609>––"Colossal!" added her sister.</t609> <t610>And the two burst into laughter.</t610>
<t611>––Even if all of Cheapside were full of their uncles ––exclaimed Bingley––, the Bennets would be no less pleasant for it.</t611>
<t612>––But it will lessen their chances of marrying men who are of some standing in the world ––replied Darcy.</t612>
<t613>Bingley made no comment on this observation of Darcy.</t613> <t614>But his sisters nodded delightedly, and spent some time amusing themselves at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relatives.</t614>
<t615>However, in an act of renewed kindness, upon leaving the dining room, they went to the sick room and sat with her until they were called for coffee.</t615> <t616>Jane was still very ill, and Elizabeth would not leave her until later, when she felt reassured seeing that she was asleep, and then it seemed to her that she should go downstairs, although she did not feel like it at all.</t616> <t617>Upon entering the living room, she found everyone playing loo, and they immediately invited her to join them.</t617> <t618>But she, fearing that they were playing for high stakes, did not accept, and, using her sister as an excuse, said that she would amuse herself with a book during the short time she could stay downstairs.</t618> <t619>Mr. Hurst looked at her in astonishment.</t619>
<t620>––Do you prefer reading over playing?––he said––.</t620> <t621>It's very strange.</t621>
<t622>––Miss Elizabeth Bennet ––said Miss Bingley–– despises letters.</t622> <t623>She is a great reader and finds pleasure in nothing else.</t623>
<t624>––I deserve neither that praise nor that criticism, exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t624> <t625>I am not a great reader and I find pleasure in many things.</t625>
<t626>––Like, for example, in taking care of her sister ––Bingley intervened––, and I hope that pleasure increases when she sees her fully recovered.</t626>
<t627>Elizabeth thanked him wholeheartedly and went to a table where there were several books.</t627> <t628>He instantly offered to go fetch others, all the ones he had in his library.</t628>
<t629>––I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and for my own prestige; but I am a lazy man, and although I do not have many books, I have more than I could ever read.</t629>
<t630>Elizabeth assured her that with those in the room, she had plenty.</t630>
<t631>––It surprises me ––said Miss Bingley–– that my father left such a small collection of books.</t631> <t632>What a splendid library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!</t632>
<t633>––It must be good ––he replied––; it is the work of many generations.</t633>
<t634>––And besides, you have increased it considerably; you are always buying books.</t634>
<t635>––I cannot understand how a family's library can be neglected in times like these.</t635>
<t636>––Don't worry!</t636> <t637>I'm sure that you don't neglect anything that pertains to enhancing the beauty of that noble place.</t637> <t638>Charles, when you build your house, I would be satisfied if it were half as beautiful as Pemberley.</t638>
<t639>––I hope I can.</t639>
<t640>––But I would advise you to buy the land near Pemberley and use it as a model.</t640> <t641>There is no county more beautiful in England than Derbyshire.</t641>
<t642>––Of course, I would do it.</t642> <t643>And I would buy Pemberley itself if Darcy were to sell it.</t643>
<t644>––I am talking about possibilities, Charles.</t644>
<t645>––Honestly, Caroline, I would rather acquire Pemberley by purchasing it than by imitating it.</t645>
<t646>Elizabeth was too absorbed in what was happening to pay the slightest attention to her book; she soon abandoned it, approached the game table, and positioned herself between Bingley and her older sister to observe the game.</t646>
<t647>––Has Miss Darcy grown since the spring? ––asked Miss Bingley––.</t647> <t648>Is she as tall as I am now?</t648>
<t649>––I think so.</t649> <t650>Now she must be as tall as Miss Elizabeth Bennet, or even taller.</t650>
<t651>––How eager I am to see her again!</t651> <t652>I've never met anyone I like so much.</t652> <t653>What a figure, what manners, and what talent for her age!</t653> <t654>She plays the piano exquisitely.</t654>
<t655>––It amazes me ––said Bingley–– that young women have so much patience to learn so much, and become as perfect as they all are.</t655>
<t656>––All the young women are perfect!</t656> <t657>My dear Charles, what do you say?</t657>
<t658>––Yes, all of them.</t658> <t659>They all paint, cover screens, and make mesh bags.</t659> <t660>I don't know any who can't do all these things, and I've never heard of a young lady for the first time without being informed that she was perfect.</t660>
<t661>––Your list of what those perfections commonly encompass ––said Darcy–– has much truth in it.</t661> <t662>The adjective is applied to women whose knowledge is no more than making mesh bags or covering screens.</t662> <t663>But I am far from agreeing with you regarding your estimation of ladies in general.</t663> <t664>Of all those I have known, I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen who are truly perfect.</t664>
<t665>––Nor I, certainly ––said Miss Bingley.</t665>
<t666>––Then observed Elizabeth–– it must be that his concept of the perfect woman is very demanding.</t666>
<t667>––Yes, it is very demanding.</t667>
<t668>––"Oh, of course!" exclaimed her faithful collaborator––.</t668> <t669>No one can truly consider themselves perfect if they do not far exceed what is normally found.</t669> <t670>A woman must have a deep knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and modern languages.</t670> <t671>And in addition to all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, in the tone of her voice, in her demeanor and way of expressing herself; otherwise, she would only deserve the title halfway.</t671>
<t672>––She must possess all this ––added Darcy––, and to it must be added something more substantial in the development of her intelligence through abundant reading.</t672>
<t673>––It doesn't surprise me now that I know only six perfect women.</t673> <t674>What surprises me is that I know any.</t674>
<t675>––Are you so severe with your own sex that you doubt this is possible?</t675>
<t676>––I have never seen a woman like that.</t676> <t677>I have never seen so much capability, so much taste, so much dedication, and so much elegance together as you describe.</t677>
<t678>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley protested against the injustice of his implicit doubt, asserting that they knew many women who fit that description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, bitterly complaining that they were not paying attention to the game.</t678> <t679>As the conversation seemed to have ended, Elizabeth soon left the room.</t679>
<t680>––Elizabeth ––said Miss Bingley when the door had closed behind her–– is one of those girls who try to make themselves agreeable to the opposite sex by discrediting their own; I won't say it doesn't work with many men, but in my opinion, it's a vile trick, a bad habit.</t680>
<t681>––Undoubtedly ––replied Darcy, to whom this observation was mainly directed–– there is baseness in all the arts that ladies sometimes lower themselves to employ to captivate men.</t681> <t682>Anything that has to do with cunning is despicable.</t682>
<t683>Miss Bingley was not satisfied enough with the answer to continue with the topic.</t683> <t684>Elizabeth rejoined them only to tell them that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her.</t684> <t685>Bingley decided to send someone immediately to fetch Dr. Jones; while his sisters, convinced that medical assistance in the countryside was useless, proposed sending someone to the capital to bring one of the most eminent doctors.</t685> <t686>Elizabeth did not want to hear of the latter, but she did not oppose doing what the brother suggested.</t686> <t687>So it was agreed to send for Dr. Jones early the next morning if Jane was not better.</t687> <t688>Bingley was quite worried and his sisters were very distressed.</t688> <t689>However, later they consoled themselves by singing some duets, while Bingley could find no better relief for his concern than giving orders to his housekeeper to pay all possible attention to the sick woman and her sister.</t689>
<t690>CHAPTER IX</t690>
<t691>Elizabeth spent most of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning she had the pleasure of being able to send a satisfactory response to the numerous questions she had been receiving very early, through one of Bingley's servants; and also to those she later received from the two elegant ladies-in-waiting of the sisters.</t691> <t692>Despite the improvement, Elizabeth asked for a note to be sent to Longbourn, as she wanted her mother to come visit Jane so she could judge the situation for herself.</t692> <t693>The note was dispatched immediately and the response to its content was fulfilled with the same speed.</t693> <t694>Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two younger daughters, arrived at Netherfield shortly after the family's breakfast.</t694>
<t695>If she had found Jane in apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very upset; but being satisfied to see that the illness was not alarming, she had no desire for her to recover quickly, as her cure would mean leaving Netherfield.</t695> <t696>For this reason, she refused to heed her daughter's request to be taken home, something that the doctor, who had arrived almost at the same time, also did not deem prudent.</t696> <t697>After sitting with Jane for a while, Miss Bingley appeared and invited them to the dining room.</t697> <t698>The mother and the three daughters followed her.</t698> <t699>Bingley received them and asked about Jane, hoping that Mrs. Bennet had not found her daughter worse than expected.</t699>
<t700>––Well, truly, I have found her very unwell ––replied Mrs. Bennet––.</t700> <t701>So unwell that it is not possible to take her home.</t701> <t702>Doctor Jones says we must not think of moving her.</t702> <t703>We will have to impose a little more on your kindness.</t703>
<t704>––Move her! ––exclaimed Bingley––.</t704> <t705>Not a chance!</t705> <t706>I'm sure my sister will also oppose her going home.</t706>
<t707>––You can trust, madam ––replied Miss Bingley with cold courtesy––, that Miss Bennet will lack nothing while she is with us.</t707>
<t708>––I am sure ––she added–– that if it weren't for such good friends, I don't know what would have become of her, because she is very ill and suffers a lot; although, that said, with the greatest patience in the world, as she always does, because she has the sweetest character I know.</t708> <t709>I often tell my other daughters that they are worth nothing compared to her.</t709> <t710>What a beautiful room this is, Mr. Bingley, and what a lovely view it has of the garden paths!</t710> <t711>I have never seen a place in the whole country comparable to Netherfield.</t711> <t712>I hope you are not thinking of leaving it suddenly, even though you have rented it for a short time.</t712>
<t713>––I do everything suddenly ––replied Bingley––.</t713> <t714>So if I decided to leave Netherfield, I would probably be gone in five minutes.</t714> <t715>But, for now, I am fine here.</t715>
<t716>––That is exactly what I expected from you ––said Elizabeth.</t716>
<t717>––You are beginning to understand me, aren't you? ––exclaimed Bingley, turning towards her.</t717>
<t718>––Oh, yes!</t718> <t719>I understand you perfectly.</t719>
<t720>––I would like to take it as a compliment; but I am afraid that being easily recognized is unfortunate.</t720>
<t721>––It is what it is.</t721> <t722>That does not necessarily mean that a deep and complex character is more or less estimable than his.</t722>
<t723>––Lizzy ––exclaimed her mother––, remember where you are and stop behaving with that intolerable conduct that we are accustomed to at home.</t723>
<t724>––I didn't know you were dedicated to studying people's character ––Bingley continued immediately––.</t724> <t725>It must be a fascinating study.</t725>
<t726>––Yes; and complex characters are the most fascinating of all.</t726> <t727>At least, they have that advantage.</t727>
<t728>––The countryside ––said Darcy–– cannot provide many subjects for such a study.</t728> <t729>In a village, one moves in an unchanging and very limited society.</t729>
<t730>––But people change so much that there is always something new to observe in them.</t730>
<t731>––Of course it does ––exclaimed Mrs. Bennet, offended by the way he had spoken about country folk––; I assure you that it happens the same in the country as in the city.</t731>
<t732>Everyone was surprised.</t732> <t733>Darcy looked at her for a moment and then turned away without saying anything.</t733> <t734>Mrs. Bennet believed she had achieved a crushing victory over him and continued triumphantly:</t734>
<t735>––For my part, I do not think that London has any advantage over the countryside, except for the shops and public places.</t735> <t736>The countryside is much more pleasant.</t736> <t737>Isn't that so, Mr. Bingley?</t737>
<t738>––When I am in the countryside ––he replied–– I do not wish to leave, and when I am in the city, the same thing happens to me.</t738> <t739>Each place has its advantages, and I feel equally comfortable in both.</t739>
<t740>––Of course, because you have a very good disposition.</t740> <t741>On the other hand, that gentleman ––she said looking at Darcy –does not seem to have a very good opinion of the countryside.</t741>
<t742>––Mom, you are very mistaken ––Elizabeth intervened, blushing at her mother's imprudence––, you misunderstand Mr. Darcy.</t742> <t743>He only meant to say that in the countryside you don't find as much variety of people as in the city.</t743> <t744>Which you must admit is true.</t744>
<t745>––Certainly, dear, no one said otherwise, but as for there not being many people in this neighborhood, I believe there are few as large as ours.</t745> <t746>I have dined with twenty-four families.</t746>
<t747>Nothing, if it weren't for his consideration for Elizabeth, could have made Bingley restrain himself.</t747> <t748>His sister was less delicate, and looked at Darcy with a very expressive smile.</t748> <t749>Elizabeth wanted to say something to change the conversation and asked her mother if Charlotte Lucas had been to Longbourn since she had left.</t749>
<t750>––Yes, he visited us yesterday with his father.</t750> <t751>What a pleasant man Sir William is! Isn't he, Mr. Bingley?</t751> <t752>So distinguished, so gentle, and so simple!</t752> <t753>He always has a kind word for everyone.</t753> <t754>That is my idea of what good manners are; those people who think they are very important and never open their mouths have no idea of manners.</t754>
<t755>––Did Charlotte have dinner with you?</t755>
<t756>––No, she went home.</t756> <t757>I think they needed her to make the meatloaf.</t757> <t758>As for me, Mr. Bingley, I always have servants who know how to do their job.</t758> <t759>My daughters are educated differently.</t759> <t760>But everyone should judge for themselves.</t760> <t761>The Lucas girls are very good girls, I assure you.</t761> <t762>It's a pity they aren't pretty!</t762> <t763>It's not that I think Charlotte is very ugly; anyway, she is a very good friend of ours.</t763>
<t764>––She seems like a very pleasant young woman ––said Bingley.</t764>
<t765>––Oh! Yes, but you must admit she is rather plain.</t765> <t766>Even Lady Lucas says so many times, and she envies me for Jane's beauty.</t766> <t767>I don't like to praise my own daughters, but the truth is that you don't often find someone as pretty as Jane.</t767> <t768>I can't be impartial, of course; but everyone says so.</t768> <t769>When she was only fifteen, there was a gentleman who lived at my brother Gardiner's house in the city, and he was so in love with Jane that my sister-in-law assured me he would propose before we left.</t769> <t770>But he didn't.</t770> <t771>He probably thought she was too young.</t771> <t772>However, he wrote her some verses, and they were quite beautiful.</t772>
<t773>––And so ended his love ––said Elizabeth impatiently––.</t773> <t774>I believe there have been many who overcame it in the same way.</t774> <t775>I wonder who was the first to discover the efficacy of poetry in ending love.</t775>
<t776>––I have always considered that poetry is the food of love ––said Darcy.</t776>
<t777>––From a great love, solid and strong, it can.</t777> <t778>Everything nourishes what is already strong by itself.</t778> <t779>But if it is only a slight inclination, without any foundation, a good sonnet would end up starving it to death.</t779>
<t780>Darcy merely smiled.</t780> <t781>A general silence followed, making Elizabeth fear that her mother might speak again.</t781> <t782>Mrs. Bennet wished to do so but did not know what to say, until after a brief pause she began to reiterate her gratitude to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane and apologized for any inconvenience Lizzy might also be causing.</t782> <t783>Mr. Bingley was courteous in his response and obliged his younger sister to be polite and say what the occasion required.</t783> <t784>She played her part, though with little grace, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied and shortly thereafter asked for her carriage.</t784> <t785>Upon hearing this, the youngest of her daughters stepped forward to say something.</t785> <t786>The two young girls had been whispering throughout the visit, and the result was that the youngest was to remind Mr. Bingley that when he first came to the countryside, he had promised to give a ball at Netherfield.</t786>
<t787>Lydia was strong, very mature for being fifteen years old, she had a good figure and a very cheerful character.</t787> <t788>She was her mother's favorite, who, out of love for her, had introduced her to society at a very young age.</t788> <t789>She was very impulsive and gave herself a lot of importance, which had increased with the attentions she received from the officers, to which her aunt's dinners and her simple manners contributed.</t789> <t790>Therefore, she was the most suitable to approach Bingley and remind him of his promise; adding that it would be a shame before the world if he did not keep it.</t790> <t791>His response to this sudden attack was delightful to Mrs. Bennet's ears.</t791>
<t792>––I assure you that I am willing to keep my commitment, as soon as your sister is well; you yourself, if you like, can set the date of the ball: You wouldn't want to be dancing while your sister is ill.</t792>
<t793>Lydia was satisfied:</t793>
<t794>––Oh! Yes, it will be much better to wait until Jane is well; and by then it is most likely that Captain Carter will be back in Meryton.</t794> <t795>And when you have given your ball ––she added––, I will insist that they give one too.</t795> <t796>I will tell Colonel Forster that it would be unfortunate if he did not.</t796>
<t797>Finally, Mrs. Bennet and her daughters left, and Elizabeth instantly returned to Jane, leaving the two ladies and Mr. Darcy to make their comments about her behavior and that of her family.</t797> <t798>However, Darcy could not share in the others' censure of Elizabeth, despite Miss Bingley's sharpness in making jokes about pretty eyes.</t798>
<t799>CHAPTER X</t799>
<t800>The day passed the same as the previous one.</t800> <t801>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent a few hours in the morning by the side of the sick woman, who was improving, though slowly.</t801> <t802>In the afternoon, Elizabeth joined them in the drawing room.</t802> <t803>But the usual card table was not set up.</t803> <t804>Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, sitting beside him, followed the course of the letter, repeatedly interrupting him with messages for her sister.</t804> <t805>Mr. Hurst and Bingley were playing piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was watching the game.</t805>
<t806>Elizabeth dedicated herself to needlework and had enough entertainment attending to what was happening between Darcy and his company.</t806> <t807>The constant praises from the latter about Darcy's handwriting, the symmetry of his lines, or the length of the letter, as well as the absolute indifference with which they were received, constituted a curious dialogue that was exactly in line with Elizabeth's opinion of each of them.</t807>
<t808>––How happy Miss Darcy will be when she receives this letter!</t808>
<t809>He did not answer.</t809>
<t810>––You write faster than anyone.</t810> <t811>––You are mistaken.</t811> <t812>I write very slowly.</t812>
<t813>––How many letters you will have the chance to write by the end of the year!</t813> <t814>Including business letters.</t814> <t815>How I detest them!</t815>
<t816>––It is fortunate, then, that it is I and not you who has to write them.</t816>
<t817>––I beg you to tell your sister that I very much wish to see her.</t817>
<t818>––I have already told him once, at his request.</t818>
<t819>––I’m afraid your pen isn’t working well.</t819> <t820>Let me sharpen it for you, I do it incredibly well.</t820>
<t821>––Thank you, but I always sharpen my own pen.</t821>
<t822>––How can you achieve such uniform handwriting?</t822>
<t823>Darcy made no comment.</t823>
<t824>––Tell your sister that I am glad to know that she has made a lot of progress with the harp; and I also ask you to tell her that I am enthusiastic about the table design she made, and that I think it is infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's.</t824>
<t825>––May I ask you to postpone your enthusiasm for another letter?</t825> <t826>In this one, I no longer have space for more compliments.</t826>
<t827>––Oh, it's not important.</t827> <t828>I will see her in January.</t828> <t829>But, do you always write such long and charming letters, Mr. Darcy?</t829>
<t830>––Generally they are long; but whether they are charming or not, it is not for me to judge.</t830>
<t831>––For me, it's like a rule, when a person writes such long letters with such ease, they can't write poorly.</t831>
<t832>––That compliment does not apply to Darcy, Caroline ––interrupted her brother––, because he does not write easily.</t832> <t833>He studies the words too much.</t833> <t834>He always looks for complicated words with more than four syllables, isn't that right, Darcy?</t834>
<t835>––My style is very different from yours.</t835>
<t836>––Oh! ––exclaimed Miss Bingley––.</t836> <t837>Charles writes without any care.</t837> <t838>He eats up half the words and smudges the rest.</t838>
<t839>––Ideas come to me so quickly that I don't have time to express them; so, sometimes, my letters don't convey any idea to the recipient.</t839>
<t840>––Your humility, Mr. Bingley ––intervened Elizabeth––, must disarm all reproaches.</t840>
<t841>––Nothing is more deceptive ––said Darcy–– than the appearance of humility.</t841> <t842>Normally, it is nothing more than a lack of opinion, and sometimes it is an indirect form of boasting.</t842>
<t843>––And which of those two adjectives do you apply to my recent act of modesty?</t843>
<t844>––An indirect way of boasting; because you, in reality, are proud of your flaws as a writer, since you attribute them to your quickness of thought and a lack of care in execution, something you consider, if not very estimable, at least very interesting.</t844> <t845>The ability to do anything quickly is always highly appreciated, and no attention is paid to the imperfection with which it is done.</t845> <t846>When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever decided to leave Netherfield, you would leave in five minutes, it was a kind of self-praise; and yet, what is praiseworthy about leaving hastily, undoubtedly leaving matters unresolved, which cannot be beneficial for you or anyone else?</t846>
<t847>––No! ––exclaimed Bingley––.</t847> <t848>It seems too much to remember at night the nonsense that is said in the morning.</t848> <t849>And I give you my word, I was convinced that what I said about myself was true, and I still am now.</t849> <t850>At least, I did not unnecessarily adopt a hasty character to show off in front of the ladies.</t850>
<t851>––Yes, I think you were convinced; but it is I who am not convinced that you would leave so hastily.</t851> <t852>Your behavior would depend on the circumstances, like that of any person.</t852> <t853>And if, already mounted on the horse, a friend were to say to you: "Bingley, stay until next week," you would probably do so, you probably wouldn't leave, and just one more word would be enough for you to stay a month.</t853>
<t854>––With this, you have only proven ––said Elizabeth–– that Bingley did not do justice to his temperament.</t854> <t855>You have favored him more now than he had done.</t855>
<t856>––I am enormously grateful ––said Bingley for turning what my friend says into a compliment.</t856> <t857>But I fear that you do not interpret it in the way my friend intended; because he would have a better opinion of me if, in that circumstance, I refused outright and left as quickly as possible.</t857>
<t858>––Would Mr. Darcy then consider the imprudence of his first intention repaired by the obstinacy of maintaining it?</t858>
<t859>––It is not I, but Darcy, who must explain it.</t859>
<t860>––You want me to account for some opinions that you attribute to me, but that I have never acknowledged.</t860> <t861>Returning to the case, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the supposed friend who wishes you to stay and delay your plan, simply desires it and asks it without offering any argument.</t861>
<t862>––Yielding quickly and easily to a friend's persuasion has no merit for you.</t862> <t863>––Yielding without conviction speaks little in favor of the intelligence of either.</t863>
<t864>––It seems to me, Mr. Darcy, that you never allow affection or friendship to influence you.</t864> <t865>Respect or esteem for the person making the request may lead us to comply without expecting any reason or argument.</t865> <t866>I am not speaking of the particular case you have mentioned regarding Mr. Bingley.</t866> <t867>Moreover, we should perhaps wait for the circumstance to arise to then discuss his behavior.</t867> <t868>But in general and in normal cases among friends, when one wants the other to change a decision, would you see it as wrong for that person to comply with the wish without expecting the other's reasons?</t868>
<t869>––Wouldn't it be advisable, before continuing with the topic, to clarify more precisely the importance of the request and the intimacy between the friends?</t869>
<t870>––Perfectly ––said Bingley––, let's pay attention to all the details without forgetting to compare height and size; because that, Miss Bennet, may carry more weight in the discussion than it seems.</t870> <t871>I assure you that if Darcy were not so tall compared to me, I would not have half the respect for him that I do.</t871> <t872>I confess that I know nothing more imposing than Darcy on certain occasions and in certain places, especially in his house and on Sunday afternoons when he has nothing to do.</t872>
<t873>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth noticed that he was quite offended and held back her laughter.</t873> <t874>Miss Bingley was very upset by the offense made to Darcy and scolded her brother for saying such nonsense.</t874>
<t875>––I know your system, Bingley ––said his friend––.</t875> <t876>You don't like arguments and you want to end this one.</t876>
<t877>––Maybe.</t877> <t878>Discussions are too much like disputes.</t878> <t879>If you and Miss Bennet postpone yours until I am not in the room, I will be very grateful; besides, that way you can say whatever you want about me.</t879>
<t880>––For my part ––said Elizabeth––, I have no objection to doing what he asks, and it is better that Mr. Darcy finishes the letter.</t880>
<t881>Darcy followed his advice and finished the letter.</t881> <t882>Task completed, he approached Miss Bingley and Elizabeth to delight them with some music.</t882> <t883>Miss Bingley hurried to the piano, but before sitting down, she courteously invited Elizabeth to play first; the latter, with equal courtesy and complete sincerity, declined the invitation; then, Miss Bingley sat down and began the concert.</t883>
<t884>Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were engaged in this activity, Elizabeth could not help but notice, each time she turned the pages of some music books that were on the piano, how frequently Darcy's eyes were fixed on her.</t884> <t885>It was difficult for her to suppose that she was an object of admiration to a man of such a rank; and it would be even stranger if he looked at her because she displeased him.</t885> <t886>Finally, she could only imagine that she caught his attention because there was something in her worse and more reprehensible, according to his concept of virtue, than in the rest of those present.</t886> <t887>This assumption did not sadden her.</t887> <t888>She liked him so little, that his opinion of her did not concern her.</t888>
<t889>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley switched the repertoire to a more cheerful Scottish tune; and at that moment Mr. Darcy approached Elizabeth and said to her:</t889>
<t890>––Would you like to take this opportunity to dance a reel, Miss Bennet?</t890>
<t891>She smiled and did not answer.</t891> <t892>He, somewhat surprised by her silence, repeated the question.</t892>
<t893>––Oh! ––she said––, I had already heard the question.</t893> <t894>I was pondering the answer.</t894> <t895>I know you would have liked me to say yes, and thus you would have had the pleasure of criticizing my tastes; but I love to thwart such traps and disappoint people who are premeditating a slight.</t895> <t896>Therefore, I have decided to tell you that I do not wish to dance at all.</t896> <t897>And now, slight me if you dare.</t897>
<t898>––I don't dare, I assure you.</t898>
<t899>She, who believed she had offended him, was astonished by his gallantry.</t899> <t900>But there was such a mixture of sweetness and malice in Elizabeth's manners that it was difficult for her to offend anyone; and Darcy had never been so captivated by a woman as he was with her.</t900> <t901>He truly believed that if it were not for the inferiority of her family, he would be in danger.</t901>
<t902>Miss Bingley saw or suspected enough to become jealous, and her anxiety for her dear friend Jane to recover increased with the desire to get rid of Elizabeth.</t902>
<t903>He was trying to provoke Darcy into becoming disillusioned with the young woman, by talking to him about his supposed marriage to her and the happiness that such an alliance would bring him.</t903>
<t904>––I hope ––he said to her the next day while they were walking in the garden–– that when that desired event takes place, you will give your mother-in-law a few warnings to moderate her tongue; and if you can manage it, prevent the younger daughters from running after the officers.</t904> <t905>And, if you allow me to mention such a delicate subject, try to restrain that something, bordering on presumption and impertinence, that your lady possesses.</t905>
<t906>––Do you have anything else to propose for my domestic happiness?</t906>
<t907>––Oh, yes!</t907> <t908>Let the portraits of your uncles, the Phillips, be hung in the gallery of Pemberley.</t908> <t909>Place them next to your great-uncle, the judge.</t909> <t910>They are of the same profession, although of different ranks.</t910> <t911>As for the portrait of your Elizabeth, you must not allow it to be made, because what painter could do justice to her beautiful eyes?</t911>
<t912>––Of course, it wouldn't be easy to capture her expression, but the color, the shape, and her pretty eyelashes could be reproduced.</t912>
<t913>At that moment, by another path in the garden, Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth came across their way.</t913>
<t914>––I didn't know you were out walking ––said Miss Bingley, a little confused at the thought that they might have overheard them.</t914>
<t915>––You have behaved very badly towards us ––Mrs. Hurst replied–– by not telling us that you were going out.</t915>
<t916>And, taking Mr. Darcy's free arm, she let Elizabeth walk alone.</t916> <t917>The path could only accommodate three.</t917> <t918>Mr. Darcy noticed such rudeness and immediately said:</t918>
<t919>––This path is not wide enough for the four of us, let's go out to the avenue.</t919>
<t920>But Elizabeth, who had no intention whatsoever of continuing with them, replied with a big smile:</t920>
<t921>––No, no; stay where you are.</t921> <t922>You make a charming group, it's much better this way.</t922> <t923>A fourth person would spoil it.</t923> <t924>Goodbye.</t924>
<t925>He left cheerfully rejoicing at the thought, while walking, that in one or two more days he would be home.</t925> <t926>Jane was already so well that that very afternoon she intended to leave her room for a couple of hours.</t926>
<t927>CHAPTER XI</t927>
<t928>When the ladies got up from the table after dinner, Elizabeth went upstairs to visit her sister, and seeing that she was well wrapped up, accompanied her to the drawing room, where her friends welcomed her with great demonstrations of joy.</t928> <t929>Elizabeth had never seen them so amiable as in the hour that passed until the gentlemen arrived.</t929> <t930>They talked about everything.</t930> <t931>They described the party in great detail, told anecdotes with much grace, and made fun of their acquaintances with humor.</t931>
<t932>But as soon as the gentlemen entered, Jane ceased to be the primary object of attention.</t932> <t933>Miss Bingley's eyes instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had not taken four steps before she had something to say to him.</t933> <t934>He went directly to Miss Bennet and courteously congratulated her.</t934> <t935>Mr. Hurst also gave her a slight nod, saying he was very glad; but the effusion and warmth were reserved for Bingley's greeting, who was very happy and full of attentions towards her.</t935> <t936>The first half hour he spent stoking the fire so that Jane would not notice the change from one room to another, and he asked her to sit by the fireplace, as far away from the door as possible.</t936> <t937>Then he sat next to her and hardly spoke to anyone else.</t937> <t938>Elizabeth, opposite, with her work, watched the scene with satisfaction.</t938>
<t939>When they finished having tea, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law about the card table, but it was in vain; she sensed that Darcy did not feel like playing, and Mr. Hurst saw his request immediately rejected.</t939> <t940>He assured her that no one felt like playing; the silence that followed his statement seemed to corroborate it.</t940> <t941>Therefore, Mr. Hurst had nothing left to do but lie down on a sofa and sleep.</t941> <t942>Darcy picked up a book, Miss Bingley picked up another, and Mrs. Hurst, mainly occupied with playing with her bracelets and rings, occasionally joined her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.</t942>
<t943>Miss Bingley paid more attention to Darcy's reading than to her own.</t943> <t944>She kept asking him questions or looking at the page he had in front of him.</t944> <t945>However, she did not manage to draw him into any conversation; he simply answered and continued reading.</t945> <t946>Finally, distressed by the idea of having to entertain herself with her book, which she had chosen only because it was the second volume of what Darcy was reading, she yawned broadly and exclaimed:</t946>
<t947>––How pleasant it is to spend an evening like this!</t947> <t948>All things considered, I think there's nothing as fun as reading.</t948> <t949>Anything else tires you quickly, but a book, never.</t949> <t950>When I have––my own house, I will be very unhappy if I don't have a large library.</t950>
<t951>Nobody said anything.</t951> <t952>Then he yawned again, closed the book, and looked around the room for something to occupy his time; when, upon hearing his brother mention a ball to Miss Bennet, he suddenly turned to him and said:</t952>
<t953>––Do you seriously think about giving a ball at Netherfield, Charles?</t953> <t954>Before deciding, I would advise you to consult with those present, for either I am very mistaken or there is someone among us who would find a ball more of a punishment than an amusement.</t954>
<t955>––If you mean Darcy ––his brother replied––, he can go to bed before it starts, if he prefers; but as for the dance, it's a done deal, and as soon as Nicholls has arranged everything, I will send the invitations.</t955>
<t956>––I would like dances much more ––replied her sister–– if they were different, but those kinds of gatherings are usually so tedious that they become unbearable.</t956> <t957>It would be more rational if the main focus in them were conversation and not dancing.</t957>
<t958>––Much more rational, yes, Caroline; but then it wouldn't resemble a dance at all.</t958>
<t959>Miss Bingley did not reply; she got up shortly after and began to walk around the room.</t959> <t960>Her figure was elegant and her gait graceful; but Darcy, to whom everything was directed, remained engrossed in his reading.</t960> <t961>She, desperate, decided to make one more effort, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:</t961>
<t962>––Miss Eliza Bennet, allow me to persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room.</t962> <t963>I assure you it is very beneficial after sitting for so long in the same position.</t963>
<t964>Elizabeth was surprised, but she agreed immediately.</t964> <t965>Miss Bingley achieved what she had intended with her kindness; Mr. Darcy looked up.</t965> <t966>He was as astonished by the novelty of this invitation as Elizabeth herself could be; unconsciously, he closed his book.</t966> <t967>Then, they invited him to walk with them, to which he refused, explaining that there could only be two reasons for them to walk through the hall together, and if he joined them, he would interfere with both.</t967> <t968>“What does he mean?”</t968> <t969>Miss Bingley was dying to know what the meaning could be and asked Elizabeth if she could understand it.</t969>
<t970>––Not at all ––he replied––; but, whatever it is, it's certain that he wants to make us look bad, and the best way to disappoint him will be not to ask him anything.</t970>
<t971>However, Miss Bingley was unable to disappoint Darcy and therefore insisted on asking him to explain the two reasons.</t971>
<t972>––I have not the slightest objection to explaining it ––he said as soon as she allowed him to speak––.</t972> <t973>You choose this way to pass the time either because you need to confide in each other or to talk about your secret affairs, or because you know that walking shows off your figure better; if it is the first, by going with you I would only be a nuisance; and if it is the second, I can admire you much better sitting by the fire.</t973>
<t974>––What a horror! ––cried Miss Bingley––.</t974> <t975>I have never heard anything so abominable.</t975> <t976>How could we give him what he deserves?</t976>
<t977>––Nothing so easy, if you are willing to do it ––said Elizabeth––.</t977> <t978>We all know how to annoy and mortify each other.</t978> <t979>Mock him, laugh at him.</t979> <t980>Being such a close friend of his, you will know very well how to do it.</t980>
<t981>––I don't know, I give you my word.</t981> <t982>I assure you that my great friendship with him has not taught me what his weak points are.</t982> <t983>Mocking a phlegmatic person, with such cold blood!</t983> <t984>And as for laughing at him just like that, we shouldn't expose ourselves; he could challenge us and we would be the ones to lose.</t984>
<t985>––We cannot laugh at Mr. Darcy! ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t985> <t986>It is a very strange privilege, and I hope it remains strange; I wouldn't like to have many acquaintances like that.</t986> <t987>I love to laugh.</t987>
<t988>––Miss Bingley ––replied Darcy–– has given me more importance than I deserve.</t988> <t989>The wisest and best of men or the wisest and best of actions can be ridiculous in the eyes of a person who thinks of nothing in this life but laughing.</t989>
<t990>––I agree ––replied Elizabeth––, there are people like that, but I don't think I am among them.</t990> <t991>I hope I never come to ridicule what is good or wise.</t991> <t992>Foolishness, nonsense, whims, and inconsistencies are the things that truly amuse me, I confess, and I laugh at them whenever I can.</t992> <t993>But I suppose these are the things you lack.</t993>
<t994>––Perhaps it is not possible for anyone, but I have spent my life striving to avoid these weaknesses that expose any intelligent person to ridicule.</t994>
<t995>––Like vanity and pride, for example.</t995>
<t996>––Yes, indeed, vanity is a flaw.</t996> <t997>But pride, in the case of people with superior intelligence, I believe is valid.</t997>
<t998>Elizabeth had to turn away to hide a smile.</t998>
<t999>––I suppose you have just finished examining Mr. Darcy ––said Miss Bingley, and I beg you to tell me what you have concluded.</t999>
<t1000>––I am fully convinced that Mr. Darcy has no faults.</t1000> <t1001>He himself clearly acknowledges it.</t1001>
<t1002>––No ––said Darcy––, I did not mean to say that.</t1002> <t1003>I have many faults, but they have nothing to do with intelligence.</t1003> <t1004>As for my character, I do not dare to vouch for it; I am too uncompromising, in fact, too uncompromising for what is convenient for people.</t1004> <t1005>I cannot forget as quickly as I should the foolishness and vices of others, nor the offenses committed against me.</t1005> <t1006>My feelings do not fade no matter how much effort is made to change them.</t1006> <t1007>Perhaps I can be accused of being resentful.</t1007> <t1008>When I lose the good opinion I have of someone, it is forever.</t1008>
<t1009>––That is really a flaw ––replied Elizabeth––.</t1009> <t1010>Implacable resentment is truly a shadow on one's character.</t1010> <t1011>But you have chosen your flaw very well.</t1011> <t1012>I cannot laugh at it.</t1012> <t1013>As for me, you are safe.</t1013>
<t1014>––I believe that in every individual there is a certain tendency towards a particular flaw, an innate defect, that not even the best education can overcome.</t1014>
<t1015>––And that flaw is the propensity to hate everyone.</t1015>
<t1016>––And yours, he replied with a smile–– is to intentionally misinterpret everyone.</t1016> <t1017>––Let's hear some music ––proposed Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she took no part––.</t1017> <t1018>Louisa, would you mind if I wake up Mr. Hurst?</t1018>
<t1019>His sister did not raise the slightest objection and opened the piano; Darcy, after a few moments of reflection, did not mind.</t1019> <t1020>He was beginning to feel the danger of paying too much attention to Elizabeth.</t1020>
<t1021>CHAPTER XII</t1021>
<t1022>According to her sister, Elizabeth wrote to her mother the next morning, asking her to send the carriage that very day.</t1022> <t1023>But Mrs. Bennet had calculated that her daughters would stay at Netherfield until Tuesday, which would make it exactly a week since Jane had arrived there, and she was not willing for them to return before the stated date.</t1023> <t1024>Thus, her response was not very favorable or, at least, it was not the response that Elizabeth would have wished for, as she was eager to return home.</t1024> <t1025>Mrs. Bennet replied that it was not possible for her to send the carriage before Tuesday; in the postscript, she added that if Mr. Bingley and his sister insisted that they stay longer, they should not hesitate, as she could very well manage without them.</t1025> <t1026>However, Elizabeth was determined not to stay there no matter how much they asked; fearing, on the contrary, to be a nuisance by staying unnecessarily longer, she begged Jane to ask Bingley for the carriage immediately; and, finally, they decided to present their plan to leave Netherfield that very morning and ask to borrow the carriage.</t1026>
<t1027>The news caused many expressions of concern; they repeatedly expressed their desire for them to stay at least until the next day, and there was no choice but to delay the departure until then.</t1027> <t1028>Miss Bingley later regretted having proposed the delay, because the jealousy and antipathy she felt for one of the sisters was far greater than the affection she felt for the other.</t1028>
<t1029>The master of the house was very saddened to learn that they were going to leave so soon, and he persistently tried to convince Jane that it would not be good for her, because she was not yet fully recovered; but Jane was firm when she knew she was acting as she should.</t1029>
<t1030>The news seemed good to Darcy.</t1030> <t1031>Elizabeth had already been at Netherfield for quite some time.</t1031> <t1032>She attracted him more than he wanted, and Miss Bingley was rude to her and more annoying to him than ever.</t1032> <t1033>He resolved to be especially careful not to let any sign of admiration escape him, nor anything that might make Elizabeth believe she had any influence on his happiness.</t1033> <t1034>Aware that he might have suggested such an idea, his behavior during the last day had to be decisive in either confirming it or removing it from her mind.</t1034> <t1035>Firm in his purpose, he barely spoke ten words to her all Saturday, and despite being left alone for half an hour, he immersed himself in his book and did not even look at her.</t1035>
<t1036>On Sunday, after the morning religious service, the separation, so pleasant for almost everyone, took place.</t1036> <t1037>Miss Bingley's courtesy towards Elizabeth increased rapidly at the last moment, as did her affection for Jane.</t1037> <t1038>Upon saying goodbye, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her both at Longbourn and at Netherfield and giving her a tender hug, she only shook hands with the former.</t1038> <t1039>Elizabeth bid farewell to everyone with a more cheerful spirit than ever.</t1039>
<t1040>The mother was not very cordial in welcoming them.</t1040> <t1041>She did not understand why they had returned so soon and told them that they were very wrong to cause her such distress; she was sure that Jane had caught a cold again.</t1041> <t1042>But the father, although very laconic in expressing joy, was truly happy to see them.</t1042> <t1043>He had realized the importance they had in the family circle.</t1043> <t1044>The evening gatherings, when everyone got together, had lost their animation and even their meaning with the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.</t1044>
<t1045>They found Mary, as usual, deeply engrossed in the profound study of human nature; they had to admire her new summaries and listen to the observations she had recently made about a very unconvincing morality.</t1045> <t1046>What Catherine and Lydia had to tell them was very different.</t1046> <t1047>Many things had been done and said in the regiment since the previous Wednesday; several officers had recently dined with their uncle, a soldier had been flogged, and there was a rumor that Colonel Forster was going to get married.</t1047>
<t1048>CHAPTER XIII</t1048>
<t1049>––I hope, my dear ––Mr. Bennet said to his wife while they were having breakfast the next morning––, that you have prepared a good meal, because I have reason to believe that one more will join us at our table today.</t1049>
<t1050>––Who are you referring to, dear?</t1050> <t1051>I have no news of anyone coming, unless Charlotte Lucas decides to visit us, and I think my meals are good enough for her.</t1051> <t1052>I don't believe they are better at her house.</t1052>
<t1053>––The person I am talking about is a gentleman and a stranger.</t1053>
<t1054>Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled like sparks.</t1054>
<t1055>––A gentleman and a stranger?</t1055> <t1056>It's Mr. Bingley, no doubt.</t1056> <t1057>Why do you never say a word about these things, Jane?</t1057> <t1058>How sly you are! Well, I will be very glad to see him.</t1058> <t1059>But, my God, what bad luck!</t1059> <t1060>Today, it's impossible to get even a bit of fish.</t1060> <t1061>Lydia, dear, ring the bell; I need to speak with Hill immediately.</t1061>
<t1062>––It is not Mr. Bingley ––said her husband––; it is a person I have never seen in my life.</t1062> <t1063>These words aroused general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being anxiously questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.</t1063>
<t1064>After having some fun, piquing their curiosity, he explained to them:</t1064>
<t1065>––A month ago I received this letter, and I replied to it about fifteen days ago, because I thought it was a very delicate matter and needed time to reflect.</t1065> <t1066>It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I die, can throw you out of this house whenever he pleases.</t1066>
<t1067>––Oh, dear! ––lamented his wife––.</t1067> <t1068>I can't bear to hear about the subject.</t1068> <t1069>Don't mention that hateful man.</t1069> <t1070>It's the worst thing that can happen in the world, that your daughters can't inherit your property.</t1070> <t1071>If I were you, I would have done something about it a long time ago.</t1071>
<t1072>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her why the inheritance did not belong to them.</t1072> <t1073>They had tried many times, but it was a topic that made their mother completely lose her reason; and she continued to complain bitterly about the cruelty of disinheriting a family of five daughters in favor of a man who meant nothing to any of them.</t1073>
<t1074>––Certainly, it is a very unfair matter ––said Mr. Bennet––, and there is nothing that can prove Mr. Collins' guilt for inheriting Longbourn.</t1074> <t1075>But if you listen to his letter, his way of expressing himself might calm you a bit.</t1075>
<t1076>––No, I won't listen to her; and besides, I find it impertinent that she writes to you, and hypocritical.</t1076> <t1077>I can't stand those false friends.</t1077> <t1078>Why doesn't she continue litigating with you like her father did?</t1078>
<t1079>––Because it seems to have some pangs of conscience, as you are about to hear:</t1079>
<t1080>Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, October 15.</t1080>
<t1081>Dear Sir,</t1081>
<t1082>The ongoing disagreement between you and my recently deceased father has always made me feel somewhat uneasy, and since I had the misfortune of losing him, I have wished to settle the matter. However, for some time, I was held back by doubts, fearing it would be disrespectful to his memory to make amends with someone he was always at odds with, so soon after his death.</t1082> <t1083>But now I have made a decision on the matter, having been ordained at Easter, as I have been fortunate enough to be distinguished with the patronage of the very honorable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose generosity and beneficence have chosen me to take charge of the esteemed rectory of her parish, where my firmest purpose will be to serve Her Ladyship with gratitude and respect, and to always be ready to perform the rites and ceremonies instituted by the Church of England.</t1083> <t1084>Moreover, as a clergyman, I believe it is my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all the families within my influence; and based on this, I hope that my present intention of goodwill will be well received, and that the fact that I am the heir to Longbourn will be forgotten by you and will not lead you to reject the olive branch I offer.</t1084> <t1085>I cannot help but be concerned about causing harm to your pleasant daughters, and I beg to be excused for this. I also want to attest to my good disposition to make all possible amends from now on.</t1085> <t1086>If you do not object to receiving me in your home, I hope to have the satisfaction of visiting you and your family on Monday, November 18th at four o'clock, and I may take advantage of your hospitality until the following Saturday, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine de Bourgh will not object and would not even disapprove of my being absent fortuitously on Sunday, as long as there is another clergyman ready to fulfill the duties of that day.</t1086> <t1087>I send affectionate regards to your wife and daughters, your friend who wishes you all the best,</t1087>
<t1088>William Collins.</t1088>
<t1089>––Therefore, at four o'clock it is possible that this conciliatory gentleman will appear ––said Mr. Bennet while folding the letter––.</t1089> <t1090>He seems to be a well-mannered and attentive young man; I have no doubt that his friendship will be valuable to us, especially if Lady Catherine is indulgent enough to allow him to come visit us.</t1090>
<t1091>––You see, it seems that what he says about our daughters makes sense.</t1091> <t1092>If he is willing to make amends, I won't be the one to discourage him.</t1092>
<t1093>––Although it is difficult ––observed Jane–– to guess what he means by that reparation he thinks we deserve, we must give credit to his intentions.</t1093>
<t1094>Elizabeth was greatly impressed by that extraordinary deference towards Lady Catherine and that earnest intention to baptize, marry, and bury his parishioners whenever necessary.</t1094>
<t1095>––It must be a bit strange ––he said––.</t1095> <t1096>I can't imagine it.</t1096> <t1097>His style is somewhat pompous.</t1097> <t1098>And what does he mean by apologizing for being the heir of Longbourn?</t1098> <t1099>I suppose he wouldn't try to avoid it, if he could.</t1099> <t1100>Dad, could he be a cunning man?</t1100>
<t1101>––No, dear, I don't think so.</t1101> <t1102>I have great hopes that it will be the opposite.</t1102> <t1103>There is a mixture of servility and presumption in his letter that confirms it.</t1103> <t1104>I am eager to see him.</t1104>
<t1105>––As for the writing ––said Mary––, your letter doesn't seem to have any flaws.</t1105> <t1106>The olive branch part isn't very original, but even so, it is well expressed.</t1106>
<t1107>Catherine and Lydia were not in the least interested in either the letter or its author.</t1107> <t1108>It was practically impossible for their cousin to show up in a scarlet coat, and it had been a few weeks since they had felt any fondness for any man dressed in another color.</t1108> <t1109>As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had extinguished her resentment, and she was prepared to receive him with such moderation that it would leave her husband and daughters perplexed.</t1109>
<t1110>Mr. Collins arrived punctually at the announced time and was received with great courtesy by the whole family.</t1110> <t1111>Mr. Bennet spoke little, but the ladies were very willing to talk, and Mr. Collins did not seem to need encouragement nor was he fond of silence.</t1111> <t1112>He was a man of twenty-five years of age, tall, with a deep gaze, a grave and static air, and ceremonious manners.</t1112> <t1113>Shortly after sitting down, he congratulated Mrs. Bennet on having such beautiful daughters; he said he had heard much about their beauty, but that the fame fell short compared to reality; and he added that he did not doubt he would see them all married in due time.</t1113> <t1114>The gallantry was not to the liking of all the listeners; but Mrs. Bennet, who was not one for formalities, replied immediately:</t1114>
<t1115>––You are very kind, and I sincerely hope that it is as you say, because otherwise the poor ones would be quite helpless, given the strange way things are arranged.</t1115>
<t1116>––Are you perhaps referring to the inheritance of this property?</t1116>
<t1117>––Ah! Indeed, sir.</t1117> <t1118>You cannot deny that it is a very distressing matter for my daughters.</t1118> <t1119>I do not blame you; you know that in this world these things are just a matter of luck.</t1119> <t1120>No one has any notion of what will happen with the properties once they have to be inherited.</t1120>
<t1121>––I deeply regret the misfortune of your lovely daughters; but I will be cautious, I do not want to rush and seem hasty.</t1121> <t1122>What I can assure these young ladies is that I have come prepared to admire them.</t1122> <t1123>For now, I will say no more, but perhaps, when we get to know each other better...</t1123>
<t1124>He was interrupted to be invited to the dining room; and the young ladies smiled at each other.</t1124> <t1125>Not only were they the object of Mr. Collins' admiration: he examined and praised the hall, the dining room, and all the furniture; and the praises he gave to everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, if it weren't for the fact that she was mortified thinking that Collins saw all of it as his future property.</t1125> <t1126>He also praised the dinner and begged to be told which of his beautiful cousins was responsible for preparing it.</t1126> <t1127>But here, Mrs. Bennet interrupted him bluntly, telling him that her means allowed her to have a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.</t1127> <t1128>He apologized for having bothered her, and she, in a very gentle tone, told him that she was not at all offended.</t1128> <t1129>But Collins continued apologizing for almost a quarter of an hour.</t1129>
<t1130>CHAPTER XIV</t1130>
<t1131>Mr. Bennet barely spoke during dinner; but when the servants had already withdrawn, he thought the opportune moment had arrived to converse with his guest.</t1131><t1132>He began with a topic he believed would be to his liking, and told him that he had been very fortunate with his patroness.</t1132><t1133>Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes and her concern for his well-being were extraordinary.</t1133><t1134>Mr. Bennet could not have chosen anything better.</t1134><t1135>Mr. Collins praised Lady Catherine with great eloquence.</t1135><t1136>The subject elevated the usual solemnity of his manners, and, giving himself much importance, he asserted that he had never seen behavior like hers in a person of her rank, nor such affability and condescension.</t1136><t1137>She had deigned to give her approval to the two sermons he had already had the honor of delivering in her presence; she had invited him to dine twice at Rosings, and just the previous Saturday had sent for him to complete her quadrille game during the evening.</t1137><t1138>He knew many people who considered Lady Catherine to be proud, but he had never seen in her anything but affability.</t1138><t1139>She always spoke to him as she would to any other gentleman; she did not object to his associating with the people of the neighborhood, nor to his leaving the parish for one or two weeks to visit his relatives.</t1139><t1140>She always saw fit to recommend that he marry as soon as possible, provided he chose wisely, and she had visited him at his humble home, where she approved of all the changes he had made, even going so far as to suggest some herself, such as, for example, putting some shelves in the closets of the upstairs rooms.</t1140>
<t1141>––All that is very well and very courteous on her part ––commented Mrs. Bennet––.</t1141> <t1142>She must be a very pleasant woman.</t1142> <t1143>It's a pity that great ladies in general do not resemble her much.</t1143> <t1144>Does she live near you?</t1144>
<t1145>––Rosings Park, Her Ladyship's residence, is only separated by a road from the estate where my humble abode is situated.</t1145>
<t1146>––I believe you said you were a widow.</t1146> <t1147>Do you have family?</t1147>
<t1148>––He has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings and other vast estates.</t1148>
<t1149>––Oh! ––sighed Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head––.</t1149> <t1150>She is in a better situation than many other young women.</t1150> <t1151>What kind of girl is she? Is she pretty?</t1151>
<t1152>––She is truly a charming young lady.</t1152> <t1153>Lady Catherine herself says that, to be honest, in terms of beauty, she far surpasses the most beautiful of her sex; because there is something in her features that reveals her distinguished birth.</t1153> <t1154>Unfortunately, she is of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from progressing in certain aspects of her education that, if not for this, would be very remarkable, according to the lady who directed her education and who still lives with them.</t1154> <t1155>But she is very kind and often has the goodness to stop by my humble residence with her little phaeton and her ponies.</t1155>
<t1156>––Has she been introduced to society yet?</t1156> <t1157>I don't remember hearing her name among the ladies of the court.</t1157>
<t1158>––The poor state of his health has unfortunately not allowed him to go to the capital, and because of this, as I once told Lady Catherine, he has deprived the British court of its most radiant ornament.</t1158> <t1159>Her Ladyship seemed very flattered by this appreciation; and you can understand that I take pleasure in directing, whenever I have the chance, these small and delicate compliments that are usually pleasing to the ladies.</t1159> <t1160>More than once I have pointed out to Lady Catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the highest rank, instead of giving her importance, would be elevated by her.</t1160> <t1161>These kinds of little things are what please Her Ladyship and I consider myself especially obliged to have such attentions with her.</t1161>
<t1162>––You judge very well ––said Mr. Bennet––, and it is fortunate that you have the talent to flatter with delicacy.</t1162> <t1163>May I ask if those pleasant compliments occur to you spontaneously or if they are the result of prior study?</t1163>
<t1164>––Normally they come to me on the spot, and although sometimes I take the time to meditate and prepare these small and elegant compliments to be able to adapt them to the occasions that arise, I always try to give them a tone that is as unstudied as possible.</t1164>
<t1165>Mr. Bennet's assumptions had been confirmed.</t1165> <t1166>His cousin was as absurd as he believed.</t1166> <t1167>He listened to him with intense pleasure, maintaining, however, the most perfect composure; and, except for the occasional glance he cast at Elizabeth, no one else needed to share in his joy.</t1167>
<t1168>However, by tea time he had had enough, and Mr. Bennet had the pleasure of taking his guest back to the drawing room.</t1168> <t1169>When tea was over, he invited him to read something aloud to the ladies.</t1169> <t1170>Collins agreed immediately and they brought a book; but as soon as he saw it ––it was immediately noticeable that it was from a circulating library–– he stopped, asked for forgiveness, and said he never read novels.</t1170> <t1171>Kitty looked at him in surprise and Lydia let out an exclamation.</t1171> <t1172>They brought other volumes and after some hesitation he chose Fordyce's sermons.</t1172> <t1173>He had barely opened the book when Lydia began to yawn, and before Collins, with monotonous solemnity, had read three pages, the girl interrupted him saying:</t1173>
<t1174>––Do you know, Mom, that Uncle Phillips is talking about dismissing Richard?</t1174> <t1175>And if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.</t1175> <t1176>Aunt told me on Saturday.</t1176> <t1177>I will go to Meryton tomorrow to find out more and to ask when Mr. Denny is coming from the city.</t1177>
<t1178>The two older sisters begged Lydia to be quiet, but Collins, very offended, put down the book and exclaimed:</t1178>
<t1179>––I have often observed how little young women are interested in books on serious subjects, despite the fact that they were written for their benefit.</t1179> <t1180>I confess that it amazes me, for there can be nothing as advantageous for them as education.</t1180> <t1181>But I do not want to keep bothering my little cousin.</t1181>
<t1182>He approached Mr. Bennet and proposed a game of backgammon.</t1182> <t1183>Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge and found that he was acting very wisely by letting the girls amuse themselves with their frivolities.</t1183> <t1184>Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologized profusely for Lydia's interruption and promised that it would not happen again if he wanted to continue reading.</t1184> <t1185>But Collins assured them that he was not angry with his cousin and that he could never interpret what she had done as an offense; and, sitting at another table with Mr. Bennet, he prepared to play backgammon.</t1185>
<t1186>CHAPTER XV</t1186>
<t1187>Mr. Collins was not an intelligent man, and the deficiencies of his nature had not been helped at all by his education or his social life.</t1187> <t1188>He spent most of his life under the authority of an uneducated and miserly father; and although he went to university, he only stayed there for the merely necessary courses and did not acquire any truly useful knowledge.</t1188> <t1189>The subjection with which his father had raised him had initially given him great humility in his character, but this was now counteracted by a vanity obtained thanks to his limited intelligence, his reclusive life, and the feelings inherent to a sudden and unexpected prosperity.</t1189> <t1190>A fortunate chance had placed him under the patronage of Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the rectory of Hunsford became vacant, and his respect for the lady's high rank and the veneration she inspired in him for being his patroness, combined with a great self-concept, his authority as a clergyman, and his rights as rector, had turned him into a mixture of pride and servility, of presumption and modesty.</t1190>
<t1191>Since he now already owned a good house and more than sufficient income, Collins was thinking about getting married.</t1191> <t1192>In his reconciliation with the Longbourn family, he sought the possibility of realizing his plan, as he intended to choose one of the daughters, provided they were as beautiful and pleasant as was said.</t1192> <t1193>This was his plan of amendment, or reparation, for inheriting the father's properties, a plan that seemed excellent to him, as it was legitimate, very appropriate, and at the same time very generous and selfless on his part.</t1193>
<t1194>His plan did not change at all upon seeing them.</t1194> <t1195>Jane's charming face confirmed his intentions and corroborated all his strict notions about the preference that should be given to the elder daughters; and thus, during the first evening, he definitively decided on her.</t1195> <t1196>However, the next morning he had to make an alteration; for before breakfast, he had a quarter-hour conversation with Mrs. Bennet.</t1196> <t1197>They began by talking about his parsonage, which naturally led him to confess his hopes of finding in Longbourn the one who was to be its mistress.</t1197> <t1198>Amidst complacent smiles and general encouragements, Mrs. Bennet gave him a warning about Jane: "As for the younger daughters, it was not for her to argue; she could not answer positively, though she did not know that anyone had made them proposals; but regarding Jane, she had to warn him, though, after all, it was something that concerned only her, that she might soon be engaged."</t1198>
<t1199>Collins only had to replace Jane with Elizabeth; and, spurred on by Mrs. Bennet, he made the change quickly.</t1199> <t1200>Elizabeth, who followed Jane in age and beauty, was the new candidate.</t1200>
<t1201>Mrs. Bennet took note of it, and she hoped that soon she would have two married daughters.</t1201> <t1202>The man she didn't even want to hear about the day before suddenly became the object of her highest esteem.</t1202>
<t1203>Lydia's plan to go to Meryton was still on.</t1203> <t1204>All the sisters, except Mary, agreed to go with her.</t1204> <t1205>Mr. Collins was going to accompany them at Mr. Bennet's request, who was eager to get rid of his relative and have the library all to himself; for Mr. Collins had followed him there after breakfast and would continue to do so, apparently occupied with one of the largest folios in the collection, though in reality, incessantly talking to Mr. Bennet about his house and garden at Hunsford.</t1205> <t1206>Such things greatly unsettled him.</t1206> <t1207>The library was the place where he knew he could enjoy his free time in peace.</t1207> <t1208>He was willing, as he told Elizabeth, to endure stupidity and conceit in any other room of the house, but in the library, he wanted to be free of all that.</t1208> <t1209>So he employed all his courtesy in inviting Collins to accompany his daughters on their walk; and Collins, who was much better at walking than reading, saw the heavens open.</t1209> <t1210>He closed the book and left.</t1210>
<t1211>And between pompous and insipid phrases on his part, and courteous nods on the part of his cousins, time passed until they reached Meryton.</t1211> <t1212>From then on, the younger sisters no longer paid him any attention.</t1212> <t1213>They had eyes only for seeking officers in the streets.</t1213> <t1214>And unless it was a truly elegant hat or a genuinely new muslin, nothing could distract them.</t1214>
<t1215>But the attention of all the young ladies was instantly captured by a young man they had not seen before, who had the appearance of being quite the gentleman, and who was walking with an officer on the opposite side of the street.</t1215> <t1216>The officer was Mr. Denny himself, whose return from London Lydia had come to inquire about, and who bowed to greet them as he passed.</t1216> <t1217>They were all impressed by the stranger's bearing and wondered who he could be.</t1217> <t1218>Kitty and Lydia, determined to find out, crossed the street under the pretext that they wanted to buy something at the shop opposite, reaching the sidewalk so fortunately that, at that very moment, the two gentlemen, on their way back, arrived at exactly the same spot.</t1218> <t1219>Mr. Denny addressed them directly and asked if he might introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had come from London with him the day before and had kindly accepted a position in the Corps.</t1219> <t1220>This was the last straw, for belonging to the regiment was the only thing he lacked to complete his charm.</t1220> <t1221>His appearance spoke highly in his favor; he was handsome and slender, with very affable manners.</t1221> <t1222>After the introduction, Mr. Wickham initiated a conversation with great ease, with the utmost correctness and without pretensions.</t1222> <t1223>They were all still standing there pleasantly chatting when the sound of horses drew their attention, and they saw Darcy and Bingley, on their mounts, coming down the street.</t1223> <t1224>Upon recognizing the young ladies in the group, the two gentlemen approached them and began the customary greetings.</t1224> <t1225>Bingley spoke more than anyone, and Jane was the main subject of his conversation.</t1225> <t1226>At that moment, he said, they were on their way to Longbourn to see how she was; Darcy confirmed this with a nod and was trying not to fix his gaze on Elizabeth when suddenly they were both paralyzed upon seeing the stranger.</t1226> <t1227>Elizabeth, who saw both their faces as they looked at each other, was very surprised by the effect the encounter had on them.</t1227> <t1228>Both changed color, one turned pale and the other red.</t1228> <t1229>After a slight hesitation, Wickham raised his hand to his hat, to which Darcy deigned to respond.</t1229> <t1230>What could that mean?</t1230> <t1231>It was impossible to imagine, but it was also impossible not to feel a great curiosity to know.</t1231>
<t1232>A moment later, Bingley, who seemed not to have noticed what had happened, said goodbye and continued on with his friend.</t1232>
<t1233>Denny and Wickham continued walking with the girls until they reached Mr. Philips' house door, where they made the appropriate bows and left despite Lydia's insistent pleas for them to come in and despite Mrs. Philips opening the vestibule window and leaning out to vocally support the invitation.</t1233>
<t1234>Mrs. Philips was always delighted to see her nieces.</t1234> <t1235>The two eldest were especially well received due to their recent absence.</t1235> <t1236>She expressed her surprise at their quick return home, of which she would have known nothing, since they did not come back in their own carriage, had it not been for the chance encounter with Dr. Jones's young man, who told her that she no longer needed to send more medicines to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets had left.</t1236> <t1237>Then Jane introduced Mr. Collins to whom she dedicated all her attention.</t1237> <t1238>She welcomed him with the most exquisite courtesy, to which Collins responded with even more refinement, apologizing for having presented himself at her house without prior notice, although he felt proud that it was the relationship with her nieces that justified such an intrusion.</t1238> <t1239>Mrs. Philips was completely overwhelmed by such an excess of good manners.</t1239> <t1240>But she soon had to set aside this stranger, due to the exclamations and questions regarding the other.</t1240> <t1241>Mrs. Philips could not tell her nieces more than they already knew: that Mr. Denny had brought him from London and that he was going to stay at the county garrison with the rank of lieutenant.</t1241> <t1242>She added that she had been observing him while he walked down the street; and if Mr. Wickham had appeared then, both Kitty and Lydia would have also approached the window to watch him, but unfortunately, at that moment only a few officers passed by who, compared to the stranger, seemed "stupid and unpleasant fellows."</t1242> <t1243>Some of these officers were going to dine the next day with the Philips, and the aunt promised them that she would tell her husband to visit Wickham to invite him too, if the Longbourn family wanted to come in the evening.</t1243> <t1244>Thus it was agreed, and Mrs. Philips offered them to play the lottery and then have a hot dinner.</t1244> <t1245>The prospect of such delights was magnificent, and the girls left very happy.</t1245> <t1246>Collins apologized again upon leaving, and he was assured that it was unnecessary.</t1246>
<t1247>On the way home, Elizabeth told Jane what had happened between the two gentlemen, and although Jane would have defended them if she had noticed anything strange, in this case, like her sister, she could not explain such behavior.</t1247>
<t1248>Collins praised Mrs. Bennet by commending the manners and education of Mrs. Philips.</t1248> <t1249>He assured that apart from Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman, for not only did she receive him with the utmost courtesy, but she also included him in the invitation for the next evening, despite being a complete stranger to her.</t1249> <t1250>Of course, he knew he should attribute it to his relationship with them, but nevertheless, he had never been treated with such kindness in his life.</t1250>
<t1251>CHAPTER XVI</t1251>
<t1252>Since no objection was raised to the young women's commitment to their aunt and Mr. Collins's reservations about not leaving the Bennets for even a single evening during his visit were firmly rejected, at the appropriate time the carriage set off with him and his five cousins towards Meryton.</t1252> <t1253>Upon entering the Philips' drawing room, the girls had the satisfaction of learning that Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation and was in the house.</t1253>
<t1254>After receiving this information, and when everyone had taken their seats, Collins was able to observe everything at his leisure; the dimensions and the furniture of the room caused him such admiration that he confessed to having believed he was in the summer dining room of Rosings.</t1254> <t1255>This comparison did not arouse any enthusiasm at first; but when Mrs. Philips heard from Collins' lips what Rosings was and who its owner was, when she heard the description of one of Lady Catherine's drawing rooms and learned that just the fireplace had cost eight hundred pounds, she appreciated the full value of that compliment and would hardly have been bothered if he had compared her drawing room to the housekeeper's room at the Bourghs'.</t1255>
<t1256>Collins amused himself by telling Mrs. Philips all about Lady Catherine's grandeur and her mansion, occasionally mentioning his humble home and the improvements he was making to it, until the gentlemen arrived.</t1256> <t1257>Collins found in Mrs. Philips an attentive listener whose good opinion of the rector increased with everything he explained to her, and she was already thinking about telling her neighbors all about it as soon as possible.</t1257> <t1258>To the young ladies, who could not stand their cousin and had nothing else to do but wish for a musical instrument at hand and examine the china imitations on the mantelpiece, the wait was becoming too long.</t1258> <t1259>But finally, the gentlemen appeared.</t1259> <t1260>When Wickham entered the room, Elizabeth noticed that she had neither paid attention to him before nor remembered him afterward with sufficient admiration.</t1260> <t1261>The county garrison officers generally enjoyed extraordinary prestige; they were very handsome, and the best of them were now at the present gathering.</t1261> <t1262>But Wickham, with his gallantry, his ease, and his graceful walk, was as superior to them as they were to the stout Uncle Philips, who entered the room last, reeking of port wine.</t1262>
<t1263>Mr. Wickham was the fortunate man to whom almost all female eyes turned; and Elizabeth was the fortunate woman beside whom he decided to take a seat.</t1263> <t1264>Wickham initiated the conversation in such a pleasant manner, despite limiting himself to saying that the night was damp and that it would probably rain a lot throughout the season, that Elizabeth realized that the most common, trivial, and worn-out topics can be interesting if said skillfully.</t1264>
<t1265>With rivals like Wickham and the other officers monopolizing the ladies' attention, Collins seemed to sink into insignificance.</t1265> <t1266>To the young women, he meant nothing.</t1266> <t1267>But Mrs. Philips still listened to him from time to time and made sure he never lacked coffee or pastries.</t1267>
<t1268>When the gaming tables were arranged, Collins saw an opportunity to return her attentions and sat down to play whist with her.</t1268>
<t1269>––I know little about this game now ––he said to him––, but I would like to learn it better, due to my situation in life.</t1269>
<t1270>Mrs. Philips thanked him for his condescension, but she could not understand those reasons.</t1270>
<t1271>Wickham did not play whist and was received with genuine enthusiasm at the other table, between Elizabeth and Lydia.</t1271> <t1272>At first, it seemed there was a danger that Lydia would completely monopolize him, as she liked to talk incessantly, but since she was also very fond of the lottery, she soon focused all her interest on the game and was too busy betting and exclaiming when prizes were won to be distracted by anything else.</t1272> <t1273>As everyone was concentrated on the game, Wickham could dedicate his time to talking with Elizabeth, and she was eager to listen to him, although she had no hope that he would tell her what she most wanted to know, the story of his relationship with Darcy.</t1273> <t1274>She did not even dare to mention his name.</t1274> <t1275>However, her curiosity was unexpectedly satisfied.</t1275> <t1276>It was Mr. Wickham himself who brought up the subject.</t1276> <t1277>He asked how far it was from Meryton to Netherfield, and after hearing Elizabeth's response and a few seconds of hesitation, he also wanted to know how long Mr. Darcy had been there.</t1277>
<t1278>––About a month ––answered Elizabeth.</t1278>
<t1279>And with eagerness that the topic wouldn't end there, he added:</t1279>
<t1280>––I believe that gentleman owns large estates in Derbyshire.</t1280>
<t1281>––Yes ––replied Wickham––, his estate is significant, it provides him with ten thousand pounds annually.</t1281> <t1282>No one better than I could give you authentic information about Mr. Darcy, for I have been particularly connected with his family since my childhood.</t1282>
<t1283>Elizabeth couldn't help but show her surprise.</t1283>
<t1284>––It will surprise you what I say, Miss Bennet, after having seen, as you probably did, the coldness of our meeting yesterday.</t1284> <t1285>Do you know Mr. Darcy well?</t1285>
<t1286>––More than I would wish ––replied Elizabeth affectionately––.</t1286> <t1287>I have spent four days in the same house as him and I find him very unpleasant.</t1287>
<t1288>––I have no right to say whether he is or isn't disagreeable ––continued Mr. Wickham––.</t1288> <t1289>I am not the most suitable person for that.</t1289> <t1290>I have known him for too long and too well to be a fair judge.</t1290> <t1291>It would be impossible for me to be impartial.</t1291> <t1292>But I believe that the opinion you have of him would surprise anyone, and you might not express it so categorically anywhere else.</t1292> <t1293>Here you are among your own.</t1293>
<t1294>––I give you my word that what I say here I would say in any other house in the neighborhood, except in Netherfield.</t1294> <t1295>Darcy has disgusted everyone with his pride.</t1295> <t1296>You will not find anyone who speaks well of him.</t1296>
<t1297>––I cannot pretend that I am sorry ––said Wickham after a brief pause––.</t1297> <t1298>I do not feel that he or anyone else should be esteemed solely for their merits, but with Darcy, it usually does not happen that way.</t1298> <t1299>People are blinded by his fortune and his importance or fear him for his distinguished and haughty manners, and they see him only as he wishes to be seen.</t1299>
<t1300>––Well, despite the little I know him, I consider him a bad person.</t1300>
<t1301>Wickham merely nodded his head.</t1301> <t1302>Then he added: "I wonder if he plans to stay in this county for long."</t1302>
<t1303>––I have no idea; but I didn't hear anything about him leaving while he was at Netherfield.</t1303> <t1304>I hope Darcy's presence won't alter his plans to stay at the county garrison.</t1304>
<t1305>––Of course not.</t1305> <t1306>I will not be the one to leave because of Mr. Darcy, and it always saddens me to see him, but I have only one reason to avoid him and I can proclaim it in front of everyone: a painful regret for his mistreatment and for being the way he is.</t1306> <t1307>His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was the best of men and my best friend; I cannot speak with Darcy without my heart breaking with a thousand tender memories.</t1307> <t1308>His conduct towards me has been improper; but I sincerely confess that I would forgive him everything except that he has frustrated his father's hopes and dishonored his memory.</t1308>
<t1309>Elizabeth found that her interest was increasing and she listened with all her senses, but the delicate nature of the matter prevented her from asking more questions.</t1309>
<t1310>Wickham began to talk about more general topics: Meryton, the neighborhood, the society; and he seemed extremely pleased with what he already knew, speaking especially of the latter with gentle but understandable gallantry.</t1310>
<t1311>––The main incentive for my joining the county garrison ––continued Wickham–– was the hope of being in constant contact with society, and people of good society.</t1311> <t1312>I knew it was a very respected and pleasant Corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by describing his current residence and the great attentions and excellent friendships he has found in Meryton.</t1312> <t1313>I confess that I need a bit of social life.</t1313> <t1314>I am a disappointed man and my state of mind could not bear solitude.</t1314> <t1315>I need occupation and company.</t1315> <t1316>It was not my intention to join military life, but current circumstances made me choose it.</t1316> <t1317>The Church should have been my profession; I was educated for it and today I would be in possession of a valuable rectory if it had not been for the gentleman I was talking about a moment ago.</t1317>
<t1318>––Really?</t1318>
<t1319>––Yes; the late Mr. Darcy had arranged for me to be presented with the best ecclesiastical benefice on his estates.</t1319> <t1320>He was my godfather and loved me dearly.</t1320> <t1321>I can never do justice to his kindness.</t1321> <t1322>He wanted to leave me well situated, and he believed he had done so; but when the position became vacant, it was granted to someone else.</t1322>
<t1323>––My God! ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t1323> <t1324>But how could that be?</t1324> <t1325>How could they contradict his will?</t1325> <t1326>Why didn't you seek justice?</t1326>
<t1327>––There was so much informality in the terms of the legacy that the law would not have given me any hope.</t1327> <t1328>A man of honor would not have doubted the intention of those terms; but Darcy preferred to doubt it or take it as a merely conditional recommendation and asserted that I had lost all my rights due to my extravagance and imprudence; in short, either for one reason or another, the fact is that the rectory became vacant two years ago, just when I was old enough to occupy it, and it was given to someone else; and it is no less true that I cannot blame myself for having done anything to deserve losing it.</t1328> <t1329>I have a fiery temperament, I am indiscreet, and perhaps I have expressed my opinion about Darcy a few times, and even to him, with excessive frankness.</t1329> <t1330>I do not remember anything else I could be accused of.</t1330> <t1331>But the fact is that we are very different and that he hates me.</t1331>
<t1332>––It's shameful!</t1332> <t1333>He deserves to be discredited in public.</t1333>
<t1334>––One day or another his time will come, but it won't be me who discredits him.</t1334> <t1335>As long as I can't forget his father, I will never be able to challenge or unmask him.</t1335>
<t1336>Elizabeth honored him for such sentiments and found him more attractive than ever as he expressed them.</t1336>
<t1337>––But ––he continued after a pause––, what could be the reason?</t1337> <t1338>What could have induced him to act with such cruelty?</t1338>
<t1339>––A deep and energetic antipathy towards me that I can only attribute to jealousy to a certain extent.</t1339> <t1340>If the late Mr. Darcy had not been so fond of me, his son would have tolerated me better.</t1340> <t1341>But the extraordinary affection that his father felt for me irritated him, I believe, from his earliest childhood.</t1341> <t1342>He did not have the character to withstand the kind of rivalry in which we found ourselves, nor the preference that his father often showed me.</t1342>
<t1343>––I remember that one day, in Netherfield, he was boasting about the relentlessness of his feelings and having an unforgiving character.</t1343> <t1344>His way of being is dreadful.</t1344>
<t1345>––I must not speak of this topic, replied Wickham––; I find it difficult to be fair with him.</t1345>
<t1346>Elizabeth reflected again and after a few moments exclaimed:</t1346>
<t1347>––To treat the godson, the friend, the father's favorite in that way!</t1347>
<t1348>He could have added: "To a young man, moreover, like you, whose face alone offers ample proof of your kindness."</t1348> <t1349>But he limited himself to saying:</t1349>
<t1350>––To a man who was surely the companion of his childhood and with whom, as I believe you have said, he had close ties.</t1350>
<t1351>––We were born in the same parish, on the same estate; we spent most of our youth together, living in the same house, sharing games, and being the object of the same parental care.</t1351> <t1352>My father started in the profession in which it seems his uncle, Mr. Philips, has achieved so much prestige; but he left it all to serve Mr. Darcy and dedicated all his time to managing the Pemberley estate.</t1352> <t1353>Mr. Darcy held him in high esteem and he was his trusted man and closest friend.</t1353> <t1354>Mr. Darcy himself often acknowledged that he owed much to my father's active supervision, and when, shortly before he died, Mr. Darcy spontaneously promised to take care of me, I am convinced he did so to repay my father a debt of gratitude as well as out of the affection he had for me.</t1354>
<t1355>––How strange! ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t1355> <t1356>How abominable!</t1356> <t1357>It astonishes me that Mr. Darcy's own pride hasn't compelled him to be just with you.</t1357> <t1358>Because, even if only for that reason, he is too proud not to be honorable; and dishonesty is what I must call what he has done to you.</t1358>
<t1359>It's curious ––answered Wickham––, because almost all of his actions have been guided by pride, which has often been his best advisor.</t1359> <t1360>For him, it is more connected to virtue than any other feeling.</t1360> <t1361>But neither of us are consistent; and in his behavior towards me, there were impulses even stronger than pride.</t1361>
<t1362>––Is it possible that such a detestable pride as his has ever led him to do some good?</t1362> <t1363>––Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to be hospitable, to help his tenants, and to aid the poor.</t1363> <t1364>Family pride, his pride as a son, because he is very proud of what his father was, has made him act in this way.</t1364> <t1365>The desire to show that he did not fall short of his own, that he was no less esteemed than they were, and that he did not diminish the influence of the house of Pemberley, was a powerful motive for him.</t1365> <t1366>He also has a brotherly pride which, combined with some fraternal affection, has made him a most kind and solicitous guardian of Miss Darcy, and you will often hear it said that he is considered the most attentive and best of brothers.</t1366>
<t1367>––What kind of girl is Miss Darcy?</t1367>
<t1368>Wickham nodded.</t1368>
<t1369>––I wish I could say she is charming.</t1369> <t1370>It pains me to speak ill of a Darcy.</t1370> <t1371>But now she resembles her brother too much, she is very proud.</t1371> <t1372>As a child, she was very affectionate and accommodating and had great affection for me.</t1372> <t1373>Oh, the hours I have spent entertaining her!</t1373> <t1374>But now she is indifferent to me.</t1374> <t1375>She is a beautiful girl of fifteen or sixteen years, I believe very well-educated.</t1375> <t1376>Since her father's death, she has been living in London with a governess.</t1376>
<t1377>After many pauses and many attempts to talk about other topics, Elizabeth could not help but return to the first subject, and said:</t1377>
<t1378>––What amazes me is his friendship with Mr. Bingley.</t1378> <t1379>How can Mr. Bingley, who is the very embodiment of good humor, and is, I am convinced, truly kind, have anything to do with a man like Mr. Darcy? How can they get along? Do you know Mr. Bingley?</t1379>
<t1380>––No, I don't know him.</t1380>
<t1381>––He is a charming man, kind, with a sweet disposition.</t1381> <t1382>You must not know what Mr. Darcy is really like.</t1382>
<t1383>––Probably not; but Mr. Darcy knows how to please when he feels like it.</t1383> <t1384>He doesn't need to make an effort.</t1384> <t1385>He can be a pleasant conversationalist if he thinks it's worth his while.</t1385> <t1386>Among people of his own rank, he is very different from how he is with those of lower status.</t1386> <t1387>Pride never leaves him, but with the wealthy, he adopts a liberal mindset; he is fair, sincere, reasonable, honorable, and perhaps even pleasant, partly due to his fortune and good looks.</t1387>
<t1388>Shortly after, the whist game ended and the players gathered around the other table.</t1388> <t1389>Collins positioned himself between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips.</t1389> <t1390>The latter asked him the usual questions about the outcome of the game.</t1390> <t1391>It was not much; he had lost all the points.</t1391> <t1392>But when Mrs. Philips began to tell him how sorry she was, Collins assured her with the utmost seriousness that it did not matter and that money was the least of his concerns, begging her not to worry about it.</t1392>
<t1393>––I know very well, madam ––he said––, that when one sits at a gaming table, one must submit to chance, and fortunately I am not in circumstances to have to worry about five shillings.</t1393> <t1394>Undoubtedly there are many who cannot say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am far from having to give importance to such trifles.</t1394>
<t1395>Wickham caught his attention, and after watching Collins for a few minutes, he quietly asked Elizabeth if her relative was a friend of the Bourgh family.</t1395>
<t1396>Lady Catherine de Bourgh has recently given him a rectory ––he replied––.</t1396> <t1397>I don't know very well who introduced them, but he hasn't known her for very long.</t1397> <t1398>––I suppose you know that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters, and that, consequently, Lady Catherine is the aunt of the current Mr. Darcy.</t1398> <t1399>––No, no idea; I didn't know anything about Lady Catherine's family.</t1399> <t1400>I had no notion of her existence until two days ago.</t1400>
<t1401>––Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will inherit a vast fortune, and it is said that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.</t1401>
<t1402>This news made Elizabeth smile at the thought of poor Miss Bingley.</t1402> <t1403>In vain were all her attentions, in vain and useless all her affection for Darcy's sister and all the praises she lavished on him if he was already destined for another.</t1403>
<t1404>––Mr. Collins ––said Elizabeth–– speaks very well of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some details he has shared about Her Ladyship, I suspect that gratitude blinds him and that, despite being his protector, she is an arrogant and vain woman.</t1404>
<t1405>––I believe it is both, and to a high degree ––Wickham replied––.</t1405> <t1406>I haven't seen her for many years, but I remember that I never liked her and that her manners were authoritarian and insolent.</t1406> <t1407>She has a reputation for being judicious and intelligent; but I get the feeling that part of her qualities derive from her rank and fortune; another part, from her despotism, and the rest, from the pride of her nephew who believes that everyone related to him must possess superior intelligence.</t1407>
<t1408>Elizabeth recognized that he had portrayed her very well, and they continued chatting together until dinner ended the game and allowed the other ladies to partake in Wickham's attentions.</t1408> <t1409>A conversation could not be started due to the noise made by Mr. Philips' guests; but his manners charmed everyone.</t1409> <t1410>Everything he said was well said and everything he did was well done.</t1410> <t1411>Elizabeth was captivated by him.</t1411> <t1412>On the way back home, she could think of nothing but Mr. Wickham and everything he had told her; but throughout the journey, she was not given a chance to even mention his name, as neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins stopped talking for a second.</t1412> <t1413>Lydia kept talking about the lottery, what she had lost, what she had won; and Collins, with praising the hospitality of the Philips, assuring that he didn't mind his losses in whist, listing all the dinner dishes, and constantly repeating that he feared his cousins were cramped because of him, had more to say than he could before the carriage stopped in front of the Longbourn house.</t1413>
<t1414>CHAPTER XVII</t1414>
<t1415>The next day Elizabeth told Jane everything that she and Wickham had talked about.</t1415> <t1416>Jane listened with astonishment and interest.</t1416> <t1417>She could not believe that Darcy was so unworthy of Bingley's esteem; and yet, she did not dare to doubt the veracity of a man with such an affable appearance as Wickham.</t1417> <t1418>The mere possibility that he had suffered such cruelty was enough to stir her most tender feelings; so she had no choice but to think ill of neither, defend the conduct of both, and attribute to chance or error what otherwise could not be explained.</t1418>
<t1419>––I have the impression ––he said–– that both have been let down, they are people, somehow disappointed by something that we cannot guess.</t1419> <t1420>Perhaps it was people interested in distorting things who set them against each other.</t1420> <t1421>In any case, we cannot speculate on the causes or circumstances that have separated them without either being at fault.</t1421>
<t1422>––You are very right; and tell me, my dear Jane: What do you have to say in favor of those interested people who probably had something to do with the matter?</t1422> <t1423>Defend them too, otherwise we will be forced to speak ill of someone.</t1423>
<t1424>––Laugh at me all you want, but you won't make me change my mind.</t1424> <t1425>Dear Lizzy, consider what a dishonorable position it places Mr. Darcy in; to treat the favorite of his father this way, someone to whom he had promised a future.</t1425> <t1426>It is impossible.</t1426> <t1427>No one even moderately good, who values their conduct at all, is capable of doing it.</t1427> <t1428>Is it possible that his closest friends are so deceived about him?</t1428> <t1429>Oh, no!</t1429>
<t1430>––I believe it is easier for Mr. Bingley's friendship to be imposed than for Mr. Wickham to have invented such a story with names, facts, and to tell it so naturally.</t1430> <t1431>And if it is not so, let Mr. Darcy be the one to deny it.</t1431> <t1432>Besides, there was sincerity in his eyes.</t1432>
<t1433>––It's really difficult, it's unfortunate.</t1433> <t1434>One doesn't know what to think.</t1434>
<t1435>––Excuse me; one knows exactly what to think.</t1435>
<t1436>The two young women were chatting in the garden when they were informed of the arrival of some of the people they were just talking about.</t1436> <t1437>Mr. Bingley and his sisters were coming to personally invite them to the much-anticipated Netherfield ball that had been scheduled for the following Tuesday.</t1437> <t1438>The Bingley sisters were very happy to see their dear friend; it seemed to them that a century had passed since they had been together, and they continually asked her what had happened to her since their separation.</t1438> <t1439>They paid little attention to the rest of the family; they avoided Mrs. Bennet as much as they could, spoke very little with Elizabeth, and did not even address the others.</t1439> <t1440>They left immediately, rising from their seats with a speed that astonished their brother; they exited so quickly that they seemed eager to escape Mrs. Bennet's attentions.</t1440>
<t1441>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extraordinarily appealing to all the female members of the family.</t1441> <t1442>Mrs. Bennet took it as a compliment to her eldest daughter and felt particularly flattered to have received the invitation from Mr. Bingley in person rather than through a ceremonious card.</t1442> <t1443>Jane imagined a happy evening in the company of her two friends and with the attentions of the brother, and Elizabeth thought with delight of dancing the whole time with Mr. Wickham and of seeing the entire story confirmed in Mr. Darcy's looks and behavior.</t1443> <t1444>The happiness that Catherine and Lydia anticipated depended less on a single fact or a particular person, because, although both, like Elizabeth, thought of dancing half the night with Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and, after all, a ball was a ball.</t1444> <t1445>Even Mary went so far as to assure her family that she did not dislike the idea of going either.</t1445>
<t1446>––As long as I can have the mornings for myself ––he said––, that's enough for me.</t1446> <t1447>It doesn't require any sacrifice on my part to occasionally accept evening commitments.</t1447> <t1448>We all owe something to society, and I confess that I am one of those who believe that intervals of recreation and relaxation are advisable for everyone.</t1448>
<t1449>Elizabeth was so excited about the occasion that, despite usually only speaking to Collins when necessary, she couldn't help but ask him if he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation and, if so, whether he thought it appropriate to attend evening parties.</t1449> <t1450>Elizabeth was surprised when he replied that he had no objections in this regard and that he did not fear that the archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh would censure him for venturing to the dance.</t1450>
<t1451>––I assure you that I absolutely do not believe ––he said–– that a ball like this, organized by a man of distinction for respectable people, could have anything wrong with it.</t1451> <t1452>I have no objection to dancing and I hope to have the honor of doing so with all my beautiful cousins.</t1452> <t1453>I take this opportunity to ask you, specifically you, Miss Elizabeth, for the first two dances, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the proper cause, and not to any disregard for her.</t1453>
<t1454>Elizabeth was completely disillusioned.</t1454> <t1455>She had intended to dedicate those two very special dances to Mr. Wickham!</t1455> <t1456>And now she had to dance them with Mr. Collins!</t1456> <t1457>She had chosen the wrong moment to become so happy.</t1457> <t1458>Well, what could she do?</t1458> <t1459>She had no choice but to postpone her happiness and Wickham's for a little later and accept Collins' proposal with the best possible attitude.</t1459> <t1460>She found no pleasure in his gallantry because there was something more hidden behind it.</t1460> <t1461>For the first time, it occurred to her that she was the chosen one among all her sisters to be the lady of the parsonage at Hunsford and to attend the quadrille parties at Rosings in the absence of more select visitors.</t1461> <t1462>This idea soon turned into conviction when she observed Collins' increasing attentions towards her and heard his frequent attempts to praise her wit and vivacity.</t1462> <t1463>Although the effect her charms had in this case left her more astonished than pleased, her mother soon made it clear that the possibility of that marriage pleased her excessively.</t1463> <t1464>However, Elizabeth preferred to ignore it, because she was sure that any reply would result in a serious argument.</t1464> <t1465>Probably Mr. Collins would never make such a proposal, and until he did, it was a waste of time to argue about him.</t1465>
<t1466>If they had not had to make preparations for the Netherfield ball, the younger Bennets would have reached a pitiable state, since from the day of the invitation until the day of the ball, the rain did not stop for a moment, preventing them from going to Meryton even once.</t1466> <t1467>No aunt, no officers, no gossip to share.</t1467> <t1468>Even the rose arrangements for the Netherfield ball had to be made to order.</t1468> <t1469>Elizabeth herself saw her patience tested by that bad weather which completely suspended the progress of her friendship with Wickham.</t1469> <t1470>Only the Tuesday ball could make a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday like those bearable for Catherine and Lydia.</t1470>
<t1471>CHAPTER XVIII</t1471>
<t1472>Until Elizabeth entered the Netherfield drawing-room and searched in vain among the group of red coats gathered there for Wickham, it did not occur to her that he might not be among the guests.</t1472> <t1473>The certainty of finding him had made her forget what would have rightly alarmed her.</t1473> <t1474>She had groomed herself with more care than usual and was prepared with a very high spirit to conquer whatever remained untamed in her heart, trusting that it was the best reward she could achieve during the evening.</t1474> <t1475>But in an instant, the horrible suspicion came over her that Wickham might have been omitted from Bingley's list of invited officers to please Darcy.</t1475> <t1476>That was not exactly the case.</t1476> <t1477>His absence was definitively confirmed by Mr. Denny, whom Lydia anxiously approached, and who told them that Mr. Wickham had been obliged to go to the capital to resolve some matters the day before and had not yet returned.</t1477> <t1478>And with a significant smile, he added:</t1478>
<t1479>––I don't believe those matters would have detained him today, unless he wanted to avoid meeting a certain gentleman here.</t1479>
<t1480>Lydia did not hear these words, but Elizabeth did; although her initial suspicion had not been true, Darcy was equally responsible for Wickham's absence, her antipathy towards the former was so exacerbated that she could barely respond politely to the kind questions Darcy asked her when he approached her shortly after.</t1480> <t1481>Any attention or tolerance towards Darcy meant an injury to Wickham.</t1481> <t1482>She decided not to have any conversation with Darcy and put herself in such a mood that she could not even conceal it when talking to Bingley, as his blind partiality irritated her.</t1482>
<t1483>But bad humor was not made for Elizabeth, and despite all her plans for the night being ruined, it soon passed.</t1483> <t1484>After telling her sorrows to Charlotte Lucas, whom she hadn't seen for a week, she soon found herself in the mood to tolerate all her cousin's oddities and approached him.</t1484> <t1485>However, the first two dances brought back her distress; they were like a penance.</t1485> <t1486>Mr. Collins, clumsy and solemn, apologizing instead of keeping to the rhythm, and losing the step without realizing it, gave her all the pity and embarrassment that an unpleasant partner can give in a couple of dances.</t1486> <t1487>Getting rid of him was like reaching ecstasy.</t1487>
<t1488>Then she had the relief of dancing with an officer with whom she could talk about Mr. Wickham, learning that everyone appreciated him.</t1488> <t1489>When this dance ended, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and they were chatting when she suddenly realized that Mr. Darcy had approached her and was asking for the next dance; she was so surprised that, without knowing what she was doing, she accepted.</t1489> <t1490>Darcy left immediately, and she, having become very nervous, stayed there wishing to regain her composure.</t1490> <t1491>Charlotte tried to console her.</t1491>
<t1492>––Maybe you'll find it charming.</t1492>
<t1493>––May God forbid it!</t1493> <t1494>That would be the greatest of all misfortunes.</t1494> <t1495>To find charming a man who must be hated!</t1495> <t1496>Do not wish me such ill.</t1496>
<t1497>When the dance resumed, Darcy approached her to take her hand, and Charlotte couldn't help but whisper in her ear not to be foolish and not to let her infatuation with Wickham make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man who was worth ten times more than him.</t1497> <t1498>Elizabeth did not reply.</t1498> <t1499>She took her place on the dance floor, astonished by the dignity bestowed upon her by standing face to face with Darcy, reading in the eyes of all her neighbors the same astonishment at witnessing the event.</t1499> <t1500>They were silent for a while; Elizabeth began to think that the silence would last until the end of the two dances.</t1500> <t1501>At first, she was determined not to break it, when suddenly she thought that the worst punishment for her partner would be to force him to talk, and she made a small remark about the dance.</t1501> <t1502>Darcy replied and fell silent again.</t1502> <t1503>After a pause of a few minutes, Elizabeth spoke for the second time and said to him:</t1503>
<t1504>––Now it's your turn to say something, Mr. Darcy.</t1504> <t1505>I've already talked about the dance, and you should make some comment about the size of the hall and the number of couples.</t1505>
<t1506>He smiled and assured her that he would say everything she wished to hear.</t1506>
<t1507>––Very well.</t1507> <t1508>That response isn't bad for now.</t1508> <t1509>Maybe little by little I'll be convinced that private dances are more pleasant than public ones; but for now, we can remain silent.</t1509>
<t1510>––Do you usually talk while you dance?</t1510>
<t1511>––Sometimes.</t1511> <t1512>It's necessary to talk a little, don't you think?</t1512> <t1513>It would be strange to be together for half an hour without saying a word.</t1513> <t1514>But out of consideration for some, you have to steer the conversation so that they don't feel compelled to say more than necessary.</t1514>
<t1515>––Are you referring to yourself or are you saying it about me?</t1515>
<t1516>––For both ––replied Elizabeth coquettishly––, for I have found a great similarity in our ways of being.</t1516> <t1517>We are both unsociable, taciturn, and averse to speaking unless we expect to say something that will dazzle everyone present and go down in history with all the brilliance of a proverb.</t1517>
<t1518>––I am sure that you are not like that.</t1518> <t1519>As for me, I wouldn't know what to say.</t1519> <t1520>You, without a doubt, believe that you have made a faithful portrait of me.</t1520>
<t1521>––I cannot judge my own work.</t1521>
<t1522>He did not answer, and it seemed that they would not open their mouths again until the dance ended, when he asked her if she and her sisters often went to Meryton.</t1522> <t1523>Elizabeth answered affirmatively and, unable to resist the temptation, added:</t1523>
<t1524>––When you found us the other day, we had just met a new friend.</t1524> <t1525>The effect was immediate.</t1525> <t1526>An intense shadow of arrogance darkened Darcy's countenance.</t1526> <t1527>But he did not say a word; Elizabeth, though reproaching herself for her weakness, preferred not to continue.</t1527> <t1528>Finally, Darcy spoke and said in a forced manner:</t1528>
<t1529>––Mr. Wickham is endowed with such pleasant manners that he can certainly make friends easily.</t1529> <t1530>What is less certain is that he is equally capable of keeping them.</t1530>
<t1531>––He has had the misfortune of losing his friendship ––said Elizabeth emphatically––, in such a way that he will suffer for it all his life.</t1531>
<t1532>Darcy did not answer and it was noticeable that he was eager to change the subject.</t1532> <t1533>At that moment, Sir William Lucas was passing near them as he crossed the dance floor with the intention of going to the other end of the hall, and upon seeing Mr. Darcy, he stopped and made a bow with all courtesy to congratulate him on his way of dancing and his partner.</t1533>
<t1534>––I am extremely pleased, my esteemed sir, such an excellent way of dancing is not often seen.</t1534> <t1535>It is evident that you belong to the most distinguished circles.</t1535> <t1536>Allow me to say, however, that your beautiful partner is in no way inferior to you, and I hope to enjoy this pleasure again, especially when a certain much-desired event, dear Elizabeth (looking at Jane and Bingley), takes place.</t1536> <t1537>How many congratulations there will be then!</t1537> <t1538>I appeal to Mr. Darcy.</t1538> <t1539>But I do not want to interrupt you, sir.</t1539> <t1540>You will thank me for not depriving you further of the captivating conversation of this young lady whose beautiful eyes are also reproaching me.</t1540>
<t1541>Darcy barely heard this last part of her speech, but the allusion to his friend seemed to impress him greatly, and with a grave expression, he directed his gaze towards Bingley and Jane who were dancing together.</t1541> <t1542>Nevertheless, he quickly recovered and, turning to Elizabeth, said:</t1542>
<t1543>––Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking about.</t1543>
<t1544>––I don't think we were talking.</t1544> <t1545>Sir William could not have interrupted another couple in the entire room who had less to say to each other.</t1545> <t1546>We have already tried two or three topics without success.</t1546> <t1547>I have no idea what we can talk about now.</t1547>
<t1548>––What do you think about books? ––he asked her, smiling.</t1548>
<t1549>––The books! Oh, no!</t1549> <t1550>I'm sure we never read the same ones or, at least, we don't get the same impressions.</t1550>
<t1551>––I regret that you think that; but if that were the case, anyway, we would not lack a topic.</t1551> <t1552>We can compare our various opinions.</t1552>
<t1553>––No, I can't talk about books in a ballroom.</t1553> <t1554>My mind is occupied with other things.</t1554>
<t1555>––In these places, one thinks only of the present, right? ––he said with a doubtful look.</t1555>
<t1556>––Yes, always ––she replied without knowing what she was saying, as her thoughts had wandered elsewhere, as she suddenly demonstrated by exclaiming––: I remember hearing you say once that you rarely forgave; that when you had conceived a resentment, it was impossible for you to appease it.</t1556> <t1557>I suppose, therefore, that you are very cautious in conceiving resentments...</t1557>
<t1558>––Indeed ––replied Darcy with a firm voice.</t1558> <t1559>––And do you never let yourself be blinded by prejudice?</t1559> <t1560>––I hope not.</t1560>
<t1561>––Those who never change their opinion must make sure before judging.</t1561>
<t1562>––Can I ask you what the intention of these questions is?</t1562>
<t1563>––To know his character, simply ––said Elizabeth, trying to conceal her seriousness––.</t1563> <t1564>I am trying to decipher it.</t1564>
<t1565>––And what conclusions have you reached?</t1565>
<t1566>––None ––he said, shaking his head––.</t1566> <t1567>I've heard such different things about you that I can't make sense of it.</t1567>
<t1568>––I acknowledge ––he replied gravely–– that opinions about me may vary greatly; and I would wish, Miss Bennet, that you do not sketch my character at this moment, because I have reasons to fear that the result would not reflect the truth.</t1568>
<t1569>––But if I don't do it now, I might not have another chance.</t1569>
<t1570>––By no means would I wish to prevent any of your satisfactions ––he replied coldly.</t1570>
<t1571>Elizabeth did not speak further, and when the dance ended, they parted in silence, both dissatisfied, though to different degrees, for in Darcy's heart there was a powerful feeling of tolerance towards her, which soon led him to forgive her and focus all his anger on another.</t1571>
<t1572>It wasn't long after they had parted ways when Miss Bingley approached Elizabeth and, with an expression of both kindness and disdain, said to her:</t1572>
<t1573>––So, Miss Eliza, you are delighted with Mr. Wickham.</t1573> <t1574>I have learned from your sister who has spoken to me about him and asked me a thousand questions.</t1574> <t1575>It seems to me that this young man forgot to tell you, among many other things, that he is the son of old Wickham, the last steward of Mr. Darcy.</t1575> <t1576>Let me advise you, as a friend, not to trust too much in everything he tells you, because the idea that Mr. Darcy treated him badly is completely false; on the contrary, he has always been extraordinarily kind to him, although George Wickham has behaved towards Mr. Darcy in the most infamous manner.</t1576> <t1577>I do not know the details, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is in no way to blame, that he cannot bear to even hear the name of George Wickham, and that, although my brother considered that he could not avoid including him in the list of invited officers, he was greatly relieved to see that he himself had stepped aside.</t1577> <t1578>The mere fact that he has come here to the countryside is a true insolence, and I cannot understand how he dared to do so.</t1578> <t1579>I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of the guilt of your favorite; but in reality, considering his origin, nothing better could be expected.</t1579>
<t1580>––His guilt and his origin seem to be the same thing to you ––Elizabeth said angrily––; because the worst thing I have heard you accuse him of is being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and I can assure you, he had already informed me of that.</t1580>
<t1581>––I beg you to excuse me ––replied Miss Bingley, turning away with disdain––.</t1581> <t1582>Forgive my intrusion; it was with the best intention.</t1582>
<t1583>“Insolent!” said Elizabeth to herself.</t1583> <t1584>“You are very mistaken if you think you will influence me with such a petty attack.</t1584> <t1585>I see nothing in it but your stubborn ignorance and Darcy's malice.”</t1585>
<t1586>Then she looked at her older sister who had dared to question Bingley about the same matter.</t1586> <t1587>Jane returned her gaze with such a sweet smile, with an expression of happiness and so much satisfaction that it clearly indicated she was very pleased with what had happened during the evening.</t1587> <t1588>Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and in a moment all her concern for Wickham, her hatred towards his enemies, and everything else disappeared before the hope that Jane was on the best path to her happiness.</t1588>
<t1589>"I want to know," said Elizabeth as smiling as her sister, "what you have heard about Mr. Wickham."</t1589> <t1590>"But perhaps you have been too busy with more pleasant things to think about a third person..."</t1590> <t1591>"If that has been the case, you can be sure that I forgive you."</t1591>
<t1592>––No ––answered Jane––, I have not forgotten him, but I have nothing pleasant to tell you.</t1592> <t1593>Mr. Bingley does not know the whole story and is unaware of the circumstances that have so offended Mr. Darcy, but he vouches for the good conduct, integrity, and honesty of his friend, and is firmly convinced that Mr. Wickham has received more attention from Mr. Darcy than he deserved; and I regret to say that, according to Mr. Bingley and his sister, Mr. Wickham is far from being a respectable young man.</t1593> <t1594>I fear he has been imprudent and well deserves to have lost Mr. Darcy's consideration.</t1594>
<t1595>––Does Mr. Bingley not know Mr. Wickham personally?</t1595>
<t1596>––No, I had never seen him before the other day in Meryton.</t1596>
<t1597>––So what you know is what Mr. Darcy has told you.</t1597> <t1598>I am satisfied.</t1598> <t1599>And what does he say about the rectory?</t1599>
<t1600>––He doesn't remember exactly how it was, although he has heard his friend tell it more than once; but he believes it was bequeathed to him only conditionally.</t1600>
<t1601>––I do not doubt Mr. Bingley's sincerity ––said Elizabeth heatedly––, but forgive me if his assertions do not convince me.</t1601> <t1602>He does well to defend his friend; but since he is unaware of some parts of the story and the only thing he knows is what he has been told, I will continue to think of the two gentlemen the same as I did before.</t1602>
<t1603>Having said this, both sisters started another conversation much more pleasant for both of them.</t1603> <t1604>Elizabeth listened delightedly to the happy yet modest hopes that Jane harbored regarding Bingley, and she said everything she could to encourage her confidence.</t1604> <t1605>When Mr. Bingley joined them, Elizabeth withdrew and went to talk with Miss Lucas, who asked her if she had liked her last partner.</t1605> <t1606>Elizabeth hardly had time to answer, because Collins presented himself to them, enthusiastically saying that he had been fortunate enough to make a very important discovery.</t1606>
<t1607>––I have learned ––he said––, by a singular chance, that there is in this room a close relative of my benefactress.</t1607> <t1608>I had the pleasure of hearing the gentleman himself mention to the lady who hosts this house the names of his cousin, Miss de Bourgh, and her mother, Lady Catherine.</t1608> <t1609>How wonderfully these things happen!</t1609> <t1610>Who would have told me that I would find a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh at this gathering!</t1610> <t1611>I am very glad to have made this discovery in time to pay my respects, which I will do right now.</t1611> <t1612>I trust you will forgive me for not having done so earlier, but my total ignorance of this relationship excuses me.</t1612>
<t1613>––Aren't you going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?</t1613>
<t1614>––Of course!</t1614> <t1615>I will ask him to excuse me for not having done it earlier.</t1615> <t1616>Don't you see that he is Lady Catherine's nephew?</t1616> <t1617>I will be able to tell him that Her Ladyship was very well the last time I saw her.</t1617>
<t1618>Elizabeth tried to dissuade him from doing such a thing by assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider addressing him without a prior introduction as an impertinence and a boldness, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that there was no need to make himself known, and if there were, it would be up to Mr. Darcy, due to the superiority of his rank, to take the initiative.</t1618> <t1619>Collins listened to her, determined to follow his own impulses, and when Elizabeth stopped speaking, he replied:</t1619>
<t1620>––My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all kinds of matters, as befits your intelligence; but allow me to tell you that there must be a great difference between the established forms of courtesy for laypeople and those accepted for clergymen; let me warn you that the office of clergyman is, in terms of dignity, equivalent to the highest rank in the kingdom, provided that those who hold it behave with the appropriate humility.</t1620> <t1621>So allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience which on this occasion lead me to do what I consider a duty.</t1621> <t1622>Excuse me, then, for not following your advice which in all other matters will constantly serve as my guide, but I believe that in this case I am more qualified, due to my education and habitual study, than a young lady like you, to decide what is proper.</t1622>
<t1623>Collins made a bow and walked away to greet Darcy.</t1623> <t1624>Elizabeth did not lose sight of him to see Darcy's reaction, whose astonishment at being approached in such a manner was evident.</t1624> <t1625>Collins began his speech with a solemn bow, and, although she could not hear him, it was as if she could, for she could read the words "apologies," "Hunsford," and "lady Catherine de Bourgh" on his lips.</t1625> <t1626>It irritated her that he would make a fool of himself in front of a man like Darcy.</t1626> <t1627>Darcy observed him without suppressing his astonishment, and when Collins allowed him to speak, he responded with distant courtesy.</t1627> <t1628>However, Collins was not discouraged and continued speaking.</t1628> <t1629>Darcy's disdain grew with the length of his second speech, and, in the end, he only made a slight bow and went elsewhere.</t1629> <t1630>Collins then turned back to Elizabeth.</t1630>
<t1631>––I assure you ––he said to her–– that I have no reason to be dissatisfied with the reception Mr. Darcy has given me.</t1631> <t1632>My attention has pleased him greatly and he has responded with the utmost politeness, even doing me the honor of stating that he was so convinced of Lady Catherine's good judgment that he took it for granted she would never bestow a favor unless it was deserved.</t1632> <t1633>It was truly a very beautiful phrase.</t1633> <t1634>In short, I am very pleased with him.</t1634>
<t1635>Elizabeth, who had no interest whatsoever in continuing to talk with Collins, devoted her attention almost entirely to her sister and Bingley; the multitude of pleasant thoughts that her observations gave rise to made her almost as happy as Jane.</t1635> <t1636>She imagined her settled in that great house with all the happiness that a marriage for true love can provide, and felt so delighted that she even believed that Bingley's two sisters might come to like her.</t1636> <t1637>It was not difficult for her to guess that her mother's thoughts followed the same path, and she decided not to risk approaching her to avoid hearing her comments.</t1637> <t1638>Unfortunately, at dinner time, they had to sit next to each other.</t1638> <t1639>Elizabeth was very upset to see how her mother kept talking to Lady Lucas, freely and openly, about her hope that Jane would soon marry Bingley.</t1639> <t1640>The topic was captivating, and Mrs. Bennet seemed never to tire of enumerating the advantages of that alliance.</t1640> <t1641>Just considering the youth of the groom, his attractiveness, his wealth, and the fact that he lived only three miles from Longbourn, made Mrs. Bennet happy.</t1641> <t1642>But in addition, one had to take into account how delighted Bingley's two sisters were with Jane, who would undoubtedly be as pleased with the union as she herself was.</t1642> <t1643>Moreover, Jane's marriage to someone of such high status was very promising for her younger daughters, who would thus have more opportunities to meet wealthy men.</t1643> <t1644>Finally, it was a relief, at her age, to be able to entrust her single daughters to the care of their sister, and not have to accompany them herself except when she felt like it.</t1644> <t1645>There was no choice but to take this circumstance as a reason for satisfaction, for in such cases, etiquette demands it; but there was no one who liked staying comfortably at home more at any time in her life.</t1645> <t1646>She concluded by wishing Lady Lucas that she would soon be as fortunate as she was, though triumphantly thinking that there was not much hope.</t1646>
<t1647>Elizabeth tried in vain to repress her mother's words and to convince her to express her joy a little more quietly; because, to her greater annoyance, she noticed that Darcy, who was sitting opposite them, was hearing almost everything.</t1647> <t1648>The only thing her mother did was scold her for being so foolish.</t1648>
<t1649>––What does Mr. Darcy mean to me?</t1649> <t1650>Tell me, why should I be afraid of him?</t1650> <t1651>We don't owe him any special attention to feel obliged not to say anything that might upset him.</t1651>
<t1652>––For the love of God, mom, speak more quietly!</t1652> <t1653>What do you gain by offending Mr. Darcy?</t1653> <t1654>The only thing you'll achieve, if you do, is to look bad in front of his friend.</t1654>
<t1655>But nothing he said had any effect.</t1655> <t1656>The mother continued to express her opinion with the same nonchalance.</t1656> <t1657>Elizabeth was becoming more and more flushed with embarrassment and displeasure.</t1657> <t1658>She couldn't stop looking at Darcy frequently, although each glance convinced her more of what she was fearing.</t1658> <t1659>Darcy rarely fixed his eyes on the mother, but Elizabeth had no doubt that his attention was on what was being said.</t1659> <t1660>The expression on his face gradually shifted from disdain and indignation to an unperturbed seriousness.</t1660>
<t1661>However, there came a moment when Mrs. Bennet had nothing more to say, and Lady Lucas, who had long been yawning at the repetition of delights in which she saw no possibility of participating, indulged in the pleasures of chicken and ham.</t1661> <t1662>Elizabeth breathed a sigh of relief.</t1662> <t1663>But this interval of tranquility did not last long; after dinner, there was talk of singing, and she had to endure the ordeal of seeing Mary, after very little persuasion, prepare to treat those present with her singing.</t1663> <t1664>With significant looks and silent pleas, Elizabeth tried to prevent this display of condescension, but it was useless.</t1664> <t1665>Mary could not understand what she meant.</t1665> <t1666>Such an opportunity to showcase her talent captivated her, and she began her song.</t1666> <t1667>Elizabeth kept watching her with a painful sensation, observing the progress of the concert with an impatience that was not rewarded in the end, for Mary, upon receiving a slight hint to continue among the expressions of gratitude from her audience, after a minute's pause, began another song.</t1667> <t1668>Mary's abilities were not the most suitable for such an exhibition; she had little voice and an affected style.</t1668> <t1669>Elizabeth endured a true agony.</t1669> <t1670>She looked at Jane to see how she was bearing it, but she was talking calmly with Bingley.</t1670> <t1671>She looked at his sisters and saw that they were making mocking gestures to each other, and at Darcy, who remained serious and unperturbed.</t1671> <t1672>Finally, she looked at her father, imploring his intervention to prevent Mary from singing all night.</t1672> <t1673>He took the hint and when Mary finished her second song, he said loudly:</t1673>
<t1674>––Girl, that's enough.</t1674> <t1675>You've done very well, you've delighted us quite enough; now let the other young ladies shine.</t1675>
<t1676>Mary, although she pretended not to hear, was a little disconcerted.</t1676> <t1677>Elizabeth felt sorry for her and regretted that her father had said that.</t1677> <t1678>She realized that due to her uneasiness, she had not acted well at all.</t1678> <t1679>Now it was someone else's turn to sing.</t1679>
<t1680>––If I ––said Collins then–– had the good fortune to be apt for singing, I would very much like to entertain the audience with a romance.</t1680> <t1681>I consider music to be an innocent distraction and completely compatible with the clerical profession.</t1681> <t1682>By this, I do not mean to say that it is right to devote too much time to music, for there are, of course, other things to attend to.</t1682> <t1683>The rector of a parish has a lot of work.</t1683> <t1684>First of all, he has to make an adjustment of the tithes that is beneficial to him and not burdensome to his patron.</t1684> <t1685>He has to write the sermons, and the time left is never enough for the parish duties and for the care and improvement of his parishioners whose lives he is obliged to make as bearable as possible.</t1685> <t1686>And I consider it of great importance that he be attentive and conciliatory with everyone, especially with those to whom he owes his position.</t1686> <t1687>I consider this indispensable and cannot hold in good esteem the man who would waste the opportunity to pay his respects to anyone related to the family of his benefactors.</t1687>
<t1688>And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, spoken so loudly that half the room heard it.</t1688> <t1689>Many stared at him intently, many smiled, but no one was as amused as Mr. Bennet, while his wife seriously praised Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and whispered to Lady Lucas that he was a very good person and extremely clever.</t1689>
<t1690>To Elizabeth, it seemed that if her family had agreed to make themselves as ridiculous as possible that night, they could not have done it better nor achieved such success; and she was very glad that Bingley and his sister had not witnessed most of the spectacle and that Bingley was not the kind of person who cared about or was bothered by the madness he might have witnessed.</t1690> <t1691>It was bad enough that the sisters and Darcy had the opportunity to mock her family; and she did not know what she found more intolerable: Darcy's silent contempt or the ladies' insolent smirks.</t1691>
<t1692>The rest of the night passed for her without the slightest interest.</t1692> <t1693>Collins drove her crazy with his insistence on not leaving her side.</t1693> <t1694>Although he did not manage to convince her to dance with him again, he prevented her from dancing with others.</t1694> <t1695>It was useless for her to beg him to go chat with other people and to offer to introduce him to some young ladies at the party.</t1695> <t1696>Collins assured her that dancing did not matter to him and that his main desire was to make himself agreeable to her with delicate attentions, so he had decided to stay by her side all night.</t1696> <t1697>There was nothing to argue about such a plan.</t1697> <t1698>Her friend Miss Lucas was the only one who consoled her by frequently sitting by her side and diverting Collins' conversation towards her.</t1698>
<t1699>At least in this way she was free of Darcy, who, although sometimes found himself at a short distance from them completely unoccupied, did not approach to speak to them.</t1699> <t1700>Elizabeth attributed it to the result of her allusions to Wickham and was glad of it.</t1700>
<t1701>The Longbourn family was the last to leave.</t1701> <t1702>Mrs. Bennet managed to make them wait for the carriages for a quarter of an hour after everyone else had left, which allowed them to notice how eager some members of the Bingley family were for them to disappear.</t1702> <t1703>Mrs. Hurst and her sister barely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue; they were visibly impatient to be alone in the house.</t1703> <t1704>They rejected all of Mrs. Bennet's attempts at conversation and the liveliness dwindled, despite Collins' long speeches congratulating Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of the party and the hospitality and finesse with which they had treated their guests.</t1704> <t1705>Darcy said absolutely nothing.</t1705> <t1706>Mr. Bennet, as silent as he, enjoyed the scene.</t1706> <t1707>Bingley and Jane were together and a little apart from the others, talking to each other.</t1707> <t1708>Elizabeth maintained the same silence as Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.</t1708> <t1709>Even Lydia was too exhausted to say more than "Good heavens! How tired I am!" amid great yawns.</t1709>
<t1710>When they finally got up to say goodbye, Mrs. Bennet insisted very courteously on her desire to soon see the whole family at Longbourn. She specifically addressed Bingley to tell him that they would be very honored if one day he came to their house to have lunch with them as a family, without the formality of a formal invitation.</t1710> <t1711>Bingley thanked her delightedly and immediately committed to taking the first opportunity that presented itself to visit them upon his return from London, where he had to go the next day, although he would not be long in coming back.</t1711>
<t1712>Mrs. Bennet was beside herself with joy and left the house convinced that, accounting for the necessary time for the celebration preparations, purchase of new carriages and wedding dresses, she would see her daughter settled in Netherfield within three or four months.</t1712> <t1713>With the same certainty and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure, she expected to soon have another daughter married to Collins.</t1713> <t1714>Elizabeth was the one she loved the least of all her daughters, and although the suitor and the wedding were more than enough for her, they were overshadowed by Bingley and by Netherfield.</t1714>
<t1715>CHAPTER XIX</t1715>
<t1716>The next day, there was another event at Longbourn.</t1716> <t1717>Collins formally proposed.</t1717> <t1718>He resolved to do it without delay, as his leave was expiring the following Saturday; and having full confidence in his success, he undertook the task methodically and with all the formalities he deemed necessary in such cases.</t1718> <t1719>Shortly after breakfast, he found Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger daughters together, and addressed the mother with these words:</t1719>
<t1720>––May I expect, madam, given your interest in your beautiful daughter Elizabeth, that I will be granted the honor of a private interview with her, during the course of this very morning?</t1720>
<t1721>Before Elizabeth had time to do anything more than blush with surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly replied:</t1721>
<t1722>––Oh, dear! That was the last thing missing!</t1722> <t1723>I'm sure Elizabeth will be delighted and won't have any objections.</t1723> <t1724>Come, Kitty, I need you upstairs.</t1724>
<t1725>And gathering her work, she hurried to leave them alone.</t1725> <t1726>Elizabeth called her, saying:</t1726>
<t1727>––Mom, dear, don't go.</t1727> <t1728>I beg you, don't go.</t1728> <t1729>Mr. Collins will excuse me; but he has nothing to say to me that everyone can't hear.</t1729> <t1730>It's me who is leaving.</t1730>
<t1731>––No, don't be silly, Lizzy.</t1731> <t1732>Stay where you are.</t1732> <t1733>And seeing that Elizabeth, upset and agitated, was about to leave, he added:</t1733>
<t1734>––Lizzy, I order you to stay and listen to Mr. Collins.</t1734>
<t1735>Elizabeth could not disobey such a command.</t1735> <t1736>For a moment, she reconsidered and thought it wiser to end all of this as soon as possible in peace and tranquility.</t1736> <t1737>She sat down again and tried hard to conceal, on one hand, the feeling of discomfort, and on the other, how amusing she found the matter.</t1737> <t1738>Mrs. Bennet and Kitty left, and then Collins began:</t1738>
<t1739>––Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, instead of harming you, adds to your other perfections.</t1739> <t1740>I would have found you less adorable if you had not shown that little resistance.</t1740> <t1741>But allow me to assure you that your mother has given me permission for this interview.</t1741> <t1742>You must already know the object of my discourse; although your natural delicacy leads you to conceal it; my intentions have been too evident to be mistaken.</t1742> <t1743>Almost from the moment I set foot in this house, I chose you as the future companion of my life.</t1743> <t1744>But before expressing my feelings, it might be advisable to explain the reasons I have for marrying, and why I came to Hertfordshire with the idea of finding a wife precisely here.</t1744>
<t1745>Elizabeth almost burst into laughter at the thought of him expressing his feelings; and she couldn't take advantage of the brief pause he made to prevent him from continuing.</t1745> <t1746>Collins continued:</t1746>
<t1747>––The reasons I have for marrying are: first, that the obligation of a clergyman in favorable circumstances like mine is to set an example of marriage in his parish; second, that I am convinced that it will contribute greatly to my happiness; and third, something that perhaps I should have mentioned first, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the most noble lady whom I have the honor to call my patroness.</t1747> <t1748>Twice she has deigned to suggest it to me, even without my hinting at it, and on the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford and during our game of quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was adjusting Miss de Bourgh's chair, she said to me: "Mr. Collins, you must marry.</t1748> <t1749>A clergyman like you must be married.</t1749> <t1750>Choose well, choose thinking of me and yourself; make sure she is an active and useful person, not highly educated, but capable of making the most of small incomes.</t1750> <t1751>This is my advice.</t1751> <t1752>Find that woman as soon as possible, bring her to Hunsford, and let me see her."</t1752> <t1753>Allow me, by the way, to say, fair cousin, that I do not consider as the least of the advantages I can offer you, the acquaintance and enjoyment of the kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</t1753> <t1754>Her manners will seem to you far above anything I can describe, and your liveliness and wit will seem very acceptable to her, especially when moderated by the discretion and respect that her high rank inevitably imposes.</t1754> <t1755>This is all regarding my general intentions in favor of marriage; I have nothing more to say except the reason why I have directed myself directly to Longbourn instead of seeking in my own locality, where, I assure you, there are many charming young ladies.</t1755> <t1756>But it is the case that being as I am the heir of Longbourn upon the death of your honorable father, whom I hope will live many years, I would not be satisfied if I did not choose a wife from among his daughters, to mitigate as much as possible the loss they will suffer upon the occurrence of such a sad event which, as I have already told you, I wish will not happen for many years.</t1756> <t1757>This has been the reason, fair cousin, and I hope it will not lower me in your esteem.</t1757> <t1758>And now I have only to express to you, in the most emphatic words, the strength of my affection.</t1758> <t1759>As for your dowry, it is absolutely indifferent to me, and I will not ask your father for anything that I know he cannot fulfill; so you will only have to bring the thousand pounds at four percent that will come to you upon your mother's death.</t1759> <t1760>But I will not be demanding and you can be assured that no interested reproach will come from my lips once we are married.</t1760>
<t1761>It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him immediately.</t1761>
<t1762>––You are going too fast ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t1762> <t1763>You forget that I have not answered you.</t1763> <t1764>Let me do so without further ado.</t1764> <t1765>I appreciate your attention and the honor that your proposal signifies, but I cannot help but decline it.</t1765>
<t1766>––I know full well ––replied Collins with a grave gesture of his hand–– that among young women it is very common to reject the proposals of the man whom, deep down, they intend to accept, when he asks for their preference for the first time, and that the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time.</t1766> <t1767>For this reason, what you have just told me does not discourage me at all, and I hope to lead you to the altar soon.</t1767>
<t1768>––Good heavens, sir! ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t1768> <t1769>I don't know what hopes you could have left after my response!</t1769> <t1770>I assure you that I am not one of those women, if such women even exist, so reckless as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time.</t1770> <t1771>My refusal is very serious.</t1771> <t1772>You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you happy.</t1772> <t1773>Moreover, if your friend Lady Catherine knew me, I have a feeling she would think that I am, in every respect, the least suitable for you.</t1773>
<t1774>––If it were true that Lady Catherine thought so... ––said Collins with the utmost seriousness–– but I am sure Her Ladyship would approve.</t1774> <t1775>And believe me ––when I have the honor of seeing her again, I will speak in the most commendatory terms of your modesty, your economy, and your other good qualities.</t1775>
<t1776>––Please, Mr. Collins, all the compliments you give me are unnecessary.</t1776> <t1777>Let me judge for myself and grant me the honor of believing what I say.</t1777> <t1778>I wish you to be very happy and very rich, and by rejecting your hand I am doing everything in my power to ensure it is so.</t1778> <t1779>In making me this proposal, you must consider the delicacy of your feelings towards my family satisfied, and when the time comes, you can take possession of the Longbourn inheritance without any pangs of conscience.</t1779> <t1780>Therefore, let us consider this matter definitively settled.</t1780>
<t1781>While he was finishing saying this, he stood up and was about to leave the room, when Collins insisted again:</t1781>
<t1782>––The next time I have the honor of speaking to you about this topic again, I hope to receive a more favorable response than the one you have given me now; although I am far from believing that you are cruel to me, for I already know that it is an incorrigible custom of women to reject men the first time they declare themselves, and you may have said all that just to make my request more consistent as befits the true delicacy of the female character.</t1782>
<t1783>––Really, Mr. Collins ––exclaimed Elizabeth somewhat heatedly–– you confuse me exceedingly.</t1783> <t1784>If you interpret everything I have said so far as encouragement, I do not know how to express my repulsion to convince you completely.</t1784>
<t1785>––You must let me presume, my dear cousin, that your rejection has been merely verbal.</t1785> <t1786>The reasons I have for believing this are as follows: I do not believe that my hand is unworthy of being accepted by you, nor that the position I offer is anything less than highly desirable.</t1786> <t1787>My situation in life, my connection with the Bourgh family, and my kinship with you are important circumstances in my favor.</t1787> <t1788>Consider, moreover, that despite your many attractions, it is not certain that you will receive another marriage proposal.</t1788> <t1789>Your fortune is so meager that it will unfortunately nullify the effects of your beauty and good qualities.</t1789> <t1790>Therefore, as I cannot deduce from all this that you have sincerely rejected me, I will choose to attribute it to your desire to increase my love with suspense, in accordance with the customary practice among elegant women.</t1790>
<t1791>––I assure you, sir, that I do not find it at all elegant to torment a respectable man.</t1791> <t1792>I would prefer that you do me the courtesy of believing me.</t1792> <t1793>I thank you a thousand times for the honor you have done me with your proposal, but it is absolutely impossible for me to accept it.</t1793> <t1794>My feelings, in every respect, prevent me from doing so.</t1794> <t1795>Could I be any clearer?</t1795> <t1796>Do not consider me as an elegant woman who intends to torture you, but as a rational being who speaks from the heart.</t1796>
<t1797>––She is always charming! ––he exclaimed with coarse gallantry––.</t1797> <t1798>I cannot doubt that my proposal will be accepted when it is sanctioned by the authority of her excellent parents.</t1798>
<t1799>Given such an effort to deceive himself, Elizabeth did not reply and left immediately without saying a word, determined that, if Collins persisted in considering her repeated refusals as a frivolous system of encouragement, she would turn to her father, whose rejection would be formulated in such a way that it would be unappealable and whose attitude, at least, could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant lady.</t1799>
<t1800>CHAPTER XX</t1800>
<t1801>Collins was not left much time to silently ponder the success of his love; because Mrs. Bennet, who had stayed in the hallway waiting for the conversation to end, as soon as she saw Elizabeth open the door and head quickly towards the stairs, entered the dining room and congratulated Collins, rejoicing over the fortunate prospect of the imminent union.</t1801> <t1802>After accepting and returning those congratulations with the same enthusiasm, Collins proceeded to explain the details of the interview, with which he was satisfied, as his cousin's firm refusal could naturally only stem from her shy modesty and the delicacy of her character.</t1802>
<t1803>But her news startled Mrs. Bennet.</t1803> <t1804>She too would have liked to believe that her daughter had only tried to encourage Collins by rejecting his proposals; but she did not dare to admit it, and thus she conveyed it to Collins.</t1804>
<t1805>––The important thing ––he added–– is that Lizzy comes to her senses.</t1805> <t1806>I will personally talk to her about this matter.</t1806> <t1807>She is a very stubborn and crazy girl and doesn't know what's good for her, but I'll make sure she understands.</t1807>
<t1808>––Excuse me for interrupting ––exclaimed Collins––, but if she is indeed stubborn and crazy, I don't know if, all things considered, she is a desirable wife for a man in my situation, who naturally seeks happiness in marriage.</t1808> <t1809>Therefore, if she insists on rejecting my proposal, it might be better not to force her to accept me, because if she has those flaws, she wouldn't contribute much to my happiness.</t1809>
<t1810>––You have misunderstood me ––said Mrs. Bennet alarmed––.</t1810> <t1811>Lizzy is stubborn only in these matters.</t1811> <t1812>In everything else, she is the most reasonable girl in the world.</t1812> <t1813>I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and I have no doubt that we will soon come to an agreement with her.</t1813>
<t1814>Without giving him time to answer, she flew to meet her husband and upon entering the library exclaimed: "Oh, Mr. Bennet!"</t1814> <t1815>We need you urgently.</t1815> <t1816>We are in a predicament.</t1816> <t1817>You must go and convince Elizabeth to marry Collins, for she has sworn she will not and if you don't hurry, Collins will change his mind and won't want her anymore.</t1817>
<t1818>When his wife entered, Mr. Bennet lifted his eyes from the book and fixed them on her face with a calm indifference that the news did not alter in the slightest.</t1818> <t1819>––I have not had the pleasure of understanding you ––he said when she finished her tirade––.</t1819> <t1820>What are you talking about? ––About Mr. Collins and Lizzy.</t1820> <t1821>Lizzy says she will not marry Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins is beginning to say he will not marry Lizzy.</t1821>
<t1822>––And what am I going to do?</t1822> <t1823>It seems to me that there's no solution.</t1823>
<t1824>––Talk to Lizzy.</t1824> <t1825>Tell her you want her to marry him.</t1825>
<t1826>––Tell him to come down.</t1826> <t1827>He will hear my opinion.</t1827>
<t1828>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell and Elizabeth was called to the library.</t1828>
<t1829>––Come, my daughter ––said her father as soon as the young woman entered––.</t1829> <t1830>I have sent for you regarding an important matter.</t1830> <t1831>They say that Collins has made you a marriage proposal, is it true?</t1831>
<t1832>Elizabeth said yes.</t1832>
<t1833>––Very well; and they say that you have rejected them.</t1833>
<t1834>––That's right, Dad.</t1834>
<t1835>––Well.</t1835> <t1836>Now let's get to the point.</t1836> <t1837>Your mother wishes you to accept it.</t1837> <t1838>Isn't that right, Mrs. Bennet?</t1838>
<t1839>Yes, or otherwise I don't want to see her anymore.</t1839>
<t1840>––You have a sad alternative before you, Elizabeth.</t1840> <t1841>From this day forward, you will have to renounce one of your parents.</t1841> <t1842>Your mother does not want to see you again if you do not marry Collins, and I do not want to see you again if you marry him.</t1842>
<t1843>Elizabeth could not help but smile at such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who was convinced that her husband would advocate for that marriage, was disappointed.</t1843>
<t1844>––What does that way of speaking mean, Mr. Bennet?</t1844> <t1845>You had promised me that you would force her to marry Mr. Collins.</t1845>
<t1846>––My dear ––replied her husband––, I have to ask you for two small favors: first, that you let me use my understanding freely in this matter, and second, that you let me enjoy my library alone as soon as you can.</t1846>
<t1847>However, Mrs. Bennet, despite the disappointment she had with her husband, still did not give up.</t1847> <t1848>She spoke to Elizabeth again and again, flattering and threatening her alternately.</t1848> <t1849>She tried to get Jane on her side; but Jane, with all possible gentleness, preferred not to get involved.</t1849> <t1850>Elizabeth, sometimes with true seriousness, and other times jokingly, responded to her attacks; and although her mood changed, her determination remained unshakable.</t1850>
<t1851>Collins, meanwhile, silently pondered everything that had happened.</t1851> <t1852>He had too high a regard for himself to understand what reasons his cousin might have for rejecting him, and although his pride was wounded, he did not suffer in the least.</t1852> <t1853>His interest in his cousin was merely imaginary; the possibility that she might be deserving of her mother's reproaches prevented him from feeling any regret.</t1853>
<t1854>While this confusion reigned in the family, Charlotte Lucas arrived, who was coming to spend the day with them.</t1854> <t1855>She met Lydia in the hall, who ran to her to quietly tell her what was happening.</t1855>
<t1856>––I'm glad you came, because there's a commotion here...!</t1856> <t1857>What do you think happened this morning?</t1857> <t1858>Mr. Collins proposed to Elizabeth and she turned him down.</t1858>
<t1859>Before Charlotte had time to answer, Kitty appeared, coming to give her the same news.</t1859> <t1860>And as soon as they entered the dining room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, she also began to talk to her about the matter.</t1860> <t1861>She begged her to have compassion and to try to convince Lizzy to yield to the wishes of the whole family.</t1861>
<t1862>––I beg you to intercede, dear Charlotte ––he added in a melancholic tone––, since no one is on my side, they treat me cruelly, no one sympathizes with my poor nerves.</t1862>
<t1863>Charlotte saved herself the response, for at that moment Jane and Elizabeth entered.</t1863>
<t1864>––There he is ––continued Mrs. Bennet––, as if nothing happened, he doesn't care about us at all, he disengages from everything just to get his way.</t1864> <t1865>I'll tell you one thing: if you get it into your head to keep rejecting all the marriage proposals you receive, you'll end up an old maid; and I don't know who will support you when your father dies.</t1865> <t1866>I won't be able to, I warn you.</t1866> <t1867>From today, I'm done with you forever.</t1867> <t1868>I told you in the library that I would never speak to you again; and what I say, I mean.</t1868> <t1869>I don't find any pleasure in talking to disobedient daughters.</t1869> <t1870>Nor with anyone.</t1870> <t1871>People like me who suffer from nerves are not fond of chatting.</t1871> <t1872>No one knows what I suffer!</t1872> <t1873>But it's always the same.</t1873> <t1874>Those who don't complain, no one pities them.</t1874>
<t1875>The daughters listened in silence to their mother's laments.</t1875> <t1876>They knew that if they tried to reason with her or calm her down, they would only succeed in irritating her more.</t1876> <t1877>So she continued speaking without anyone interrupting her, until Collins entered with a more solemn air than usual.</t1877> <t1878>Upon seeing him, Mrs. Bennet said to the girls:</t1878>
<t1879>––Now I ask you to shut your mouths and leave Mr. Collins and me so we can talk for a while.</t1879>
<t1880>Elizabeth left the room in silence; Jane and Kitty followed her, but Lydia did not move, determined to listen to everything she could.</t1880> <t1881>Charlotte, held back by Mr. Collins's courtesy, whose questions about her and her family followed one after another without interruption, and also a bit by curiosity, merely approached the window pretending not to listen.</t1881> <t1882>In a sad voice, Mrs. Bennet thus began her conversation:</t1882>
<t1883>––Oh, Mr. Collins!</t1883>
<t1884>––My dear madam ––he replied––, not another word on this matter.</t1884> <t1885>I am very far ––he continued with an accent that denoted his indignation–– from harboring any resentment towards your daughter's attitude.</t1885> <t1886>It is everyone's duty to resign themselves to inevitable misfortunes; and it is especially a duty for me, who has had the fortune of seeing myself so young in such an elevated position; I trust I will know how to resign myself.</t1886> <t1887>It may be that my beautiful cousin, by not wanting to honor me with her hand, has not diminished my positive happiness.</t1887> <t1888>I have often observed that resignation is never as perfect as when the denied happiness begins to lose some value in our estimation.</t1888> <t1889>I hope you do not suppose that I am disrespecting your family, my dear madam, by withdrawing my plans regarding your daughter without asking you and Mr. Bennet to interpose your authority on my behalf.</t1889> <t1890>I fear that my conduct, by accepting my rejection from your daughter's lips and not from yours, may be censurable.</t1890> <t1891>But we are all capable of making mistakes.</t1891> <t1892>I am sure I have acted with the best intention in this matter.</t1892> <t1893>My objective was to procure myself a kind companion with due consideration to the advantages this would bring to your entire family.</t1893> <t1894>If my conduct has been reproachable, I beg you to forgive me.</t1894>
<t1895>CHAPTER XXI</t1895>
<t1896>The discussions about Collins' offer were coming to an end; Elizabeth no longer had to endure more than that uncomfortable feeling, which inevitably derives from such situations, and, from time to time, some pointed allusions from her mother.</t1896> <t1897>As for the gentleman, he did not show himself to be disturbed, nor dejected, nor did he try to avoid Elizabeth, but expressed his feelings with an attitude of rigidity and a resentful silence.</t1897> <t1898>He hardly spoke to her; and those assiduous attentions so appreciated on his part, he dedicated all day to Miss Lucas who listened to him kindly, providing everyone and especially her friend Elizabeth with great relief.</t1898>
<t1899>The next morning, Mrs. Bennet's bad mood and poor health had not subsided.</t1899> <t1900>Mr. Collins also suffered from the wound to his pride.</t1900> <t1901>Elizabeth thought that his resentment would shorten his visit; but Mr. Collins's plans did not seem to be altered in the slightest.</t1901> <t1902>He had initially planned to leave on Saturday and intended to stay until Saturday.</t1902>
<t1903>After lunch, the girls went to Meryton to find out if Wickham had returned, and to lament his absence at the Netherfield ball.</t1903> <t1904>They found him upon entering the town and he accompanied them to their aunt's house, where they talked at length about his absence and misfortune and the consternation it had caused everyone.</t1904> <t1905>But in front of Elizabeth, he willingly admitted that his absence had been premeditated.</t1905>
<t1906>––As the moment approached ––he said–– it seemed to me that it would be better not to meet Darcy, for being together in a room for so many hours would have been beyond my strength and the situation could have become unpleasant, moreover, for other people.</t1906>
<t1907>Elizabeth fully approved of Wickham's conduct and they discussed it extensively, exchanging mutual praises as they headed towards Longbourn, where Wickham and another officer accompanied the young ladies.</t1907> <t1908>During the walk, Wickham devoted himself entirely to Elizabeth, providing her with a double satisfaction: receiving his compliments and having the opportunity to introduce him to her parents.</t1908>
<t1909>Shortly after arriving, they brought a letter for Jane.</t1909> <t1910>It came from Netherfield, and the young woman opened it immediately.</t1910> <t1911>The envelope contained a very elegant and glossy sheet of paper, covered with the handwriting of a beautiful and agile woman's hand.</t1911> <t1912>Elizabeth noticed that her sister's expression changed as she read and that she lingered over certain paragraphs.</t1912> <t1913>Jane quickly composed herself; she put down the letter and tried to join in the conversation with her usual cheerfulness; but Elizabeth was so curious that she even stopped paying attention to Wickham.</t1913> <t1914>And as soon as he and his companion left, Jane invited her with a look to accompany her upstairs.</t1914> <t1915>Once in her room, Jane showed her the letter and said:</t1915>
<t1916>––It is from Caroline Bingley; its content has surprised me greatly.</t1916> <t1917>Everyone in the house has left Netherfield and at this hour they are on their way to the capital, from where they do not plan to return.</t1917> <t1918>Listen to what it says.</t1918>
<t1919>Jane read aloud the first paragraph where it was stated that they had decided to go to London with her brother and that they intended to eat that same day on Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had his house.</t1919> <t1920>The following was written as follows: "I do not regret leaving Hertfordshire except for you, dearest friend; but I hope to enjoy again later the delightful moments we spent together and in the meantime we can lessen the sorrow of separation with very frequent and effusive letters.</t1920> <t1921>I count on your correspondence."</t1921> <t1922>Elizabeth listened to all these grand expressions with impassivity due to the distrust they inspired in her.</t1922> <t1923>She was surprised by the haste with which they had left, but in reality, she saw no reason to regret it.</t1923> <t1924>It could not be supposed that the fact that they were not in Netherfield would prevent Bingley from coming; and as for the absence of the ladies, she was sure that Jane would console herself with the presence of the brother.</t1924>
<t1925>––It's a shame ––he said to her after a brief pause–– that you couldn't see your friends before they left.</t1925> <t1926>But can't we hope that this "later on" of future happiness that your friend so desires will come sooner than she thinks and that this wonderful relationship you had as friends will be renewed with greater satisfaction as sisters?</t1926> <t1927>They are not going to detain Mr. Bingley in London.</t1927>
<t1928>––Caroline says that decidedly none of them will return to Hertfordshire this winter.</t1928> <t1929>I will read it to you: «When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the matters calling him to London could be handled in three or four days; but as we know that this will not be the case and convinced, at the same time, that when Charles goes to the capital he is in no hurry to return, we have decided to go with him so that he does not have to spend his free hours in a hotel, without any comfort.</t1929> <t1930>Many of our acquaintances are already there to spend the winter; I would like to know if you, dearest friend, plan to do the same; but I don't think it possible.</t1930> <t1931>I sincerely wish that Christmas in Hertfordshire is bountiful in the joys typical of these festivities, and that your suitors are so numerous that they prevent you from feeling the loss of the three gentlemen we are taking away from you.»</t1931>
<t1932>––Therefore, it is evident ––added Jane–– that Mr. Bingley is not coming back this winter.</t1932>
<t1933>––The only thing that is evident is that Miss Bingley is the one who says he is not coming back.</t1933>
<t1934>––Why do you believe that?</t1934> <t1935>It must be Mr. Bingley's doing: It doesn't depend on anyone.</t1935> <t1936>But you don't know everything yet.</t1936> <t1937>I'm going to read you the passage that hurts me the most.</t1937> <t1938>I don't want to hide anything from you.</t1938> <t1939>«Mr. Darcy is eager to see his sister, and the truth is that we are no less eager to see her.</t1939> <t1940>I believe that Georgina Darcy has no equal in beauty, elegance, and talent, and the affection she inspires in Louisa and me increases with the hope we harbor that she will be our sister in the future.</t1940> <t1941>I don't know if I have ever expressed to you my feelings on this matter; but I don't want to leave without confiding it to you, and I imagine you will find it very reasonable.</t1941> <t1942>My brother already feels great admiration for her, and now he will have frequent opportunities to see her with the greatest intimacy.</t1942> <t1943>Georgina's family desires this union as much as we do, and I don't think I am blinded by sisterly passion in believing that Charles is very capable of winning any woman's heart.</t1943> <t1944>With all these circumstances in favor of this relationship and nothing to prevent it, I cannot be mistaken, dearest Jane, if I hope for the event that would bring happiness to so many people.»</t1944>
<t1945>––What do you think of this paragraph, Lizzy? ––asked Jane after finishing reading––.</t1945> <t1946>Isn't it quite clear?</t1946> <t1947>Doesn't it clearly express that Caroline neither expects nor desires that I be her sister, that she is completely convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings towards him, she intends, with all kindness, of course, to warn me?</t1947> <t1948>Can this matter be interpreted in any other way?</t1948>
<t1949>––Yes, it can be done.</t1949> <t1950>I interpret it very differently.</t1950> <t1951>Do you want to know how?</t1951>
<t1952>––Of course.</t1952>
<t1953>––I will tell you in a few words.</t1953> <t1954>Miss Bingley has realized that her brother is in love with you and she wants him to marry Miss Darcy.</t1954> <t1955>She has gone to the capital after him, hoping to keep him there, and is trying to convince you that Bingley does not care about you at all.</t1955>
<t1956>Jane shook her head.</t1956>
<t1957>––That's right, Jane; you must believe me.</t1957> <t1958>No one who has seen you together can doubt Bingley's affection.</t1958> <t1959>His sister doesn't doubt it either, she's not that foolish.</t1959> <t1960>If she had seen half of that affection in Darcy towards her, she would have already ordered the wedding dress.</t1960> <t1961>But the thing is this: we are neither rich enough nor distinguished enough for them.</t1961> <t1962>If Miss Bingley is so eager to marry Miss Darcy to her brother, it's because it would make it easier for her to marry Darcy himself; which seems a bit naive on her part.</t1962> <t1963>But I would dare to believe that she would achieve her desires if Miss de Bourgh were not in the way.</t1963> <t1964>However, you can't seriously think that just because Miss Bingley tells you that her brother likes Miss Darcy, he is less in love with you than he was on Thursday when he said goodbye; nor that it is possible for his sister to convince him to love Miss Darcy instead of you.</t1964>
<t1965>––If our opinion of Miss Bingley were the same ––replied Jane––, your explanation would reassure me.</t1965> <t1966>But I know that you are being unfair to her.</t1966> <t1967>Caroline is incapable of deceiving anyone; the only thing I can hope for in this case is that she is deceiving herself.</t1967>
<t1968>––That's right.</t1968> <t1969>You couldn't have come up with a better idea, since mine doesn't comfort you.</t1969> <t1970>Suppose she's mistaken.</t1970> <t1971>That way you'll be in good standing with her and you'll see that you have nothing to worry about.</t1971>
<t1972>––But Lizzy, can I be happy, even assuming the best, by accepting a man whose sisters and friends wish him to marry another?</t1972>
<t1973>––You must decide that for yourself ––said Elizabeth––, if after mature reflection you find that the misfortune of displeasing his sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you, of course, to reject Bingley.</t1973>
<t1974>––What things you say! said Jane with a slight smile––.</t1974> <t1975>You must know that although their disapproval would sadden me greatly, I would not hesitate.</t1975>
<t1976>––I already figured as much, and being so, I don't think I can sympathize with your situation.</t1976>
<t1977>––But if he doesn't come back all winter, my choice will be useless.</t1977> <t1978>So many things can happen in six months!</t1978>
<t1979>Elizabeth rejected the idea that Bingley would not return; it seemed to her simply a suggestion born of Caroline's self-interested wishes, and she could not suppose for a moment that such wishes, whether expressed openly or covertly, would influence the mind of a man so independent.</t1979>
<t1980>He explained to his sister as eloquently as he could his point of view, and soon observed the good effect of his words.</t1980> <t1981>Jane was by nature an optimist, which gradually led her to hope that Bingley would return to Netherfield and fulfill all the desires of her heart, although doubt occasionally assailed her.</t1981>
<t1982>They agreed that they would only inform Mrs. Bennet about the family's departure, so she wouldn't be too alarmed; but she was quite alarmed anyway; and lamented the tremendous misfortune that the ladies had left just when they had become so close.</t1982> <t1983>She was very upset about it, but consoled herself by thinking that Bingley would soon return to dine at Longbourn, and ended up declaring that despite having invited him to a family dinner, she would make sure to prepare two first-rate dishes for that day.</t1983>
<t1984>CHAPTER XXII</t1984>
<t1985>The Bennets were invited to dine with the Lucases, and once again Miss Lucas had the kindness to listen to Collins for most of the day.</t1985> <t1986>Elizabeth took the first opportunity to thank her.</t1986>
<t1987>––This puts him in a good mood.</t1987> <t1988>I am more grateful to you than you can imagine ––she said to him.</t1988>
<t1989>Charlotte assured her that she was glad to be able to do something for her, and that it compensated her for the small sacrifice of dedicating her time.</t1989> <t1990>It was very kind of her, but Charlotte's kindness went further than Elizabeth could suspect: her goal was none other than to prevent Collins from directing his compliments to her friend again, attracting them to herself instead.</t1990> <t1991>This was Charlotte's plan, and appearances were so favorable to her that upon parting that night, she could almost have taken success for granted, if Collins did not have to leave Hertfordshire so soon.</t1991> <t1992>But in conceiving this doubt, she did not do justice to Collins' fiery and independent character; the next morning he slipped away from Longbourn with admirable stealth and ran to the Lucas' house to surrender at her feet.</t1992> <t1993>He wanted to conceal his departure from his cousins because if they had seen him, they would have discovered his intention, and he did not want to announce it until he was sure of success; although he felt almost certain of it, for Charlotte had encouraged him enough, but since his adventure on Wednesday, he was a little lacking in confidence.</t1993> <t1994>Nevertheless, he received a very flattering welcome.</t1994> <t1995>Miss Lucas saw him arriving from a window, and immediately went out to the path to meet him as if by chance.</t1995> <t1996>But little could she imagine how much love and eloquence awaited her.</t1996>
<t1997>In the short span of time left by Collins' endless speeches, everything was arranged between them to mutual satisfaction.</t1997> <t1998>Upon entering the house, Collins earnestly begged her to name the day when she would make him the happiest of men; and although such a request had to be postponed for the moment, the lady did not wish to play with his happiness.</t1998> <t1999>The stupidity with which nature had endowed her deprived her courtship of the charms that might incline a woman to prolong it; Miss Lucas, who had accepted him solely out of the pure and selfless desire to marry, did not care how soon this event would take place.</t1999>
<t2000>They quickly informed Sir William and Lady Lucas to obtain their consent, which was granted with the greatest promptness and joy.</t2000><t2001>Collins' situation made him a very desirable match for their daughter, to whom they could leave only a small fortune, and the prospects of future well-being were too tempting.</t2001><t2002>Lady Lucas immediately began to calculate with more interest than ever how many more years Mr. Bennet might live, and Sir William expressed his opinion that when Collins became the owner of Longbourn, it would be very convenient for him and his wife to make their appearance at St. James.</t2002><t2003>In short, the whole family rejoiced greatly at the news.</t2003><t2004>The younger daughters hoped to be presented in society a year or two earlier than they would have been otherwise due to this circumstance.</t2004><t2005>The sons were relieved of the fear that Charlotte might remain single.</t2005><t2006>Charlotte was calm.</t2006><t2007>She had won the game and had time to consider it.</t2007><t2008>Her reflections were generally satisfactory.</t2008><t2009>To tell the truth, Collins was neither intelligent nor pleasant, his company was tedious, and his affection for her must have been imaginary.</t2009><t2010>But, after all, he would be her husband.</t2010><t2011>Although Charlotte did not have a high opinion of men or marriage, she had always desired it because it was the only honorable position for a well-educated young woman with little fortune, and, although it could not be guaranteed to be a source of happiness, it would always be the most agreeable resource against need.</t2011><t2012>This resource was what she had just obtained, for at twenty-seven years of age, never having been pretty, it was a real stroke of luck for her.</t2012><t2013>The least pleasant part of all was the surprise that Elizabeth Bennet would receive, whose friendship she valued more than that of any other person.</t2013><t2014>Elizabeth would be astonished and probably would not approve; and, although the decision was already made, Elizabeth's disapproval would hurt her greatly.</t2014><t2015>She resolved to tell her herself, so she recommended to Collins, when he returned to Longbourn for dinner, not to say anything about what had happened.</t2015><t2016>Naturally, he duly promised to keep the secret; but it was difficult for him, because the curiosity aroused by his long absence burst upon his return in such direct questions that it required great skill to evade them; moreover, it represented a real self-denial for Collins, as he was impatient to proclaim his romantic success to the four winds.</t2016>
<t2017>The next day he had to leave, but since he had to set off too early to see any member of the family, the farewell ceremony took place when the ladies went to bed.</t2017> <t2018>Mrs. Bennet, with great courtesy and warmth, told him that she would be very happy to see him in Longbourn again when his other commitments allowed him to visit them.</t2018>
<t2019>––My dear lady ––replied Collins––, I particularly appreciate this invitation because I very much wanted to receive it; rest assured that I will take advantage of it as soon as possible.</t2019>
<t2020>Everyone was astonished, and Mr. Bennet, who in no way desired such a quick return, hastened to say:</t2020>
<t2021>––But, isn't there a danger that Lady Catherine will disapprove this time?</t2021> <t2022>It is better to be negligent with his relatives than to risk offending his patroness.</t2022>
<t2023>––Dear sir ––replied Collins––, I am very grateful to you for this friendly warning, and you can be assured that I will not take a single step that is not authorized by His Lordship.</t2023>
<t2024>––All precautions are few.</t2024> <t2025>Risk anything except inconveniencing her, and if you believe that your visits to our house could cause that, which I consider more than possible, stay quietly in yours and console yourself thinking that we will not be offended.</t2025>
<t2026>––Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude increases with your affectionate advice, so I warn you that you will soon receive a letter of thanks for the same and for all the other proofs of consideration that you have given me during my stay in Hertfordshire.</t2026> <t2027>As for my beautiful cousins, although my absence will not be so long as to make it necessary, I will take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excluding my cousin Elizabeth.</t2027>
<t2028>After the customary pleasantries, the ladies withdrew.</t2028> <t2029>They were all equally surprised to see that he intended to return soon.</t2029> <t2030>Mrs. Bennet wanted to attribute it to his intention of courting one of her younger daughters, so she decided to convince Mary to accept him.</t2030> <t2031>Indeed, Mary appreciated Collins more than the others; she found a solidity in his reflections that often dazzled her, and although she did not consider him as intelligent as herself, she believed that if he were encouraged to read and to follow an example like hers, he could become a very pleasant companion.</t2031> <t2032>But the next morning, the entire plan fell apart, for Miss Lucas came to visit them just after lunch and in a private conversation with Elizabeth, she recounted the events of the previous day.</t2032>
<t2033>The possibility that Collins might believe himself in love with her friend had already occurred to Elizabeth one or two days before, but that Charlotte would encourage him seemed as impossible as if she herself would do it.</t2033> <t2034>Her astonishment, therefore, was so great that it exceeded all bounds of decorum and she could not refrain from shouting at her:</t2034>
<t2035>––Engaged to Mr. Collins! How is that possible, Charlotte?</t2035>
<t2036>Charlotte had told the story with much serenity, but now she felt momentarily confused for having received such a direct reproach; although it was what she had expected.</t2036> <t2037>But she recovered quickly and said calmly:</t2037>
<t2038>––What are you surprised about, Elizabeth?</t2038> <t2039>Does it seem incredible to you that Mr. Collins was able to gain the esteem of a woman just because he was not fortunate with you?</t2039>
<t2040>But, in the meantime, Elizabeth had regained her composure, and with a tremendous effort, she was able to assure him with enough firmness that she was delighted by the idea of their kinship and wished him all the happiness in the world.</t2040>
<t2041>––I know how you feel ––replied Charlotte––.</t2041> <t2042>You must be surprised, very surprised, considering how little Mr. Collins wanted to marry you.</t2042> <t2043>But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will understand what I have done.</t2043> <t2044>You know I am not romantic.</t2044> <t2045>I never have been.</t2045> <t2046>I seek nothing more than a comfortable home, and considering Collins' character, his connections, and his position, I am convinced that I have as much chance of being happy with him as most people have when they marry.</t2046>
<t2047>Elizabeth answered sweetly:</t2047>
<t2048>––It is undeniable.</t2048>
<t2049>And after a somewhat awkward pause, they went to join the rest of the family.</t2049> <t2050>Charlotte left immediately, and Elizabeth stayed behind, pondering what she had just heard.</t2050> <t2051>It took her a long time to come to terms with such a ludicrous marriage.</t2051> <t2052>The oddity of Collins having made two marriage proposals in three days was nothing compared to the fact that he had been accepted.</t2052> <t2053>She always believed that Charlotte's theories about marriage were not exactly like hers, but she never supposed that in putting them into practice, she would sacrifice her best feelings to worldly matters.</t2053> <t2054>And to the pain caused by seeing how her friend had discredited herself and lost much of the esteem she had for her, was added the distressing conviction that it would be impossible for her to be happy with the fate she had chosen.</t2054>
<t2055>CHAPTER XXIII</t2055>
<t2056>Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, pondering over what she had heard and unsure whether to tell it or not, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce the engagement to the family.</t2056> <t2057>Amid many compliments and congratulating the union of the two houses, he revealed the matter to an audience not only astonished but also incredulous, as Mrs. Bennet, with more obstinacy than courtesy, insisted that he must be completely mistaken, and Lydia, always indiscreet and often ill-mannered, exclaimed boisterously:</t2057>
<t2058>––Holy God! What are you saying, Sir William?</t2058> <t2059>Don't you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Elizabeth?</t2059>
<t2060>Only the condescension of a courtier could have endured that behavior without getting angry; but Sir William's good manners were above all.</t2060> <t2061>He begged to be allowed to guarantee the truth of what he said, but he listened to all those impertinences with the utmost correctness.</t2061>
<t2062>Elizabeth felt compelled to help him out of such an awkward situation, and confirmed his words, revealing what she knew from Charlotte herself.</t2062> <t2063>She tried to put an end to the exclamations of her mother and sisters warmly congratulating Sir William, in which she was soon seconded by Jane, and commenting on the happiness that could be expected from the event, given Mr. Collins's excellent character and the convenient distance from Hunsford to London.</t2063>
<t2064>Mrs. Bennet was certainly too overwhelmed to speak much while Sir William remained in the house; but as soon as he left, she quickly vented.</t2064> <t2065>First, she insisted on not believing a word; second, she was sure that Collins had been deceived; third, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourth, the wedding would not take place.</t2065> <t2066>However, two things clearly emerged from all this: that Elizabeth was the true cause of all the misfortune, and that she, Mrs. Bennet, had been treated in a barbaric manner by everyone.</t2066> <t2067>The rest of the day was spent ranting, and there was nothing that could console or calm her.</t2067> <t2068>A week had to pass before she could see Elizabeth without reprimanding her; a month, before she spoke to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude; and much longer, before she forgave Charlotte.</t2068>
<t2069>Mr. Bennet's mood upon hearing the news was calmer; moreover, he was even pleased, because in this way he could confirm, as he said, that Charlotte Lucas, whom he never considered very smart, was as foolish as his wife, and much more so than his daughter.</t2069>
<t2070>Jane confessed that she had been surprised; but she spoke less of her astonishment than of her sincere wishes that both would be happy, not even Elizabeth managed to make her see that such happiness was unlikely.</t2070> <t2071>Catherine and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Collins was nothing more than a clergyman and the event held no more interest for them than that of being able to spread it around Meryton.</t2071>
<t2072>Lady Lucas could not resist the joy of being able to get back at Mrs. Bennet by expressing the comfort she felt in having a married daughter; she went to Longbourn more frequently than usual to tell how happy she was, although Mrs. Bennet's unfriendly looks and malicious comments could have ended all that happiness.</t2072>
<t2073>Between Elizabeth and Charlotte, there was a barrier that made them remain silent on the subject, and Elizabeth had the impression that true trust would never exist between them again.</t2073> <t2074>The disappointment she had felt from Charlotte made her turn to her sister with more affection and admiration than ever; her sister's integrity and delicacy guaranteed that her opinion of her would never change, and her happiness concerned her more each day, as it had been a week since Bingley had left and nothing was known about his return.</t2074>
<t2075>Jane immediately replied to Caroline Bingley's letter, and she was calculating the days it might take to receive the response.</t2075> <t2076>The promised letter from Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to the father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude that only a year of living with the family could have justified.</t2076> <t2077>After apologizing at the beginning, he proceeded to inform him, with much grandiloquence, of his happiness for having obtained the affection of his charming neighbor Miss Lucas, and then expressed that it was only with the intention of enjoying her company that he had felt so inclined to accede to their kind wishes to see him again in Longbourn, where he hoped to return on Monday in a fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so cordially approved of his marriage that she wished it to be celebrated as soon as possible, something he trusted would be an irrefutable argument for his dear Charlotte to set the day when she would make him the happiest of men.</t2077>
<t2078>Mrs. Bennet no longer found Collins's return to Hertfordshire a cause for satisfaction.</t2078> <t2079>On the contrary, she deplored it more than her husband: "It was very odd that Collins came to Longbourn instead of going to the Lucas's house; it was very inconvenient and extremely embarrassing.</t2079> <t2080>She hated having visitors given her poor health, and engaged couples were the most unbearable beings in the world."</t2080> <t2081>These were Mrs. Bennet's constant murmurs, which only ceased in the face of an even greater distress: Mr. Bingley's long absence.</t2081>
<t2082>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were calm about this matter.</t2082> <t2083>The days passed without any more news except for what soon spread through Meryton: that the Bingleys would not return for the entire winter.</t2083> <t2084>Mrs. Bennet was indignant and did not stop denying it, asserting that it was the most atrocious falsehood one could hear.</t2084>
<t2085>Even Elizabeth began to fear, not that Bingley had forgotten Jane, but that his sisters might succeed in separating him from her.</t2085> <t2086>Despite not wanting to admit such a disastrous idea for Jane's happiness and so unworthy of her lover's firmness, Elizabeth could not help but frequently think of it.</t2086> <t2087>She feared that the combined effort of his heartless sisters and his influential friend, along with the attractions of Miss Darcy and the pleasures of London, could be too many things at once against Bingley's affection.</t2087>
<t2088>As for Jane, the anxiety that this doubt caused her was, naturally, more painful than Elizabeth's; but no matter what she felt, she wanted to hide it, and therefore the matter was never mentioned between her and her sister.</t2088> <t2089>Her mother, however, was not restrained by the same delicacy and not an hour passed without her talking about Bingley, expressing her impatience for his arrival or insisting that Jane confess that if he did not return, they would have been treated in the most indecorous manner.</t2089> <t2090>It took all of Jane's gentleness to endure these attacks with tolerable calmness.</t2090>
<t2091>Collins returned promptly on Monday in fifteen days; the reception he received at Longbourn was not as cordial as the first time.</t2091> <t2092>But the man was too happy for anything to affect him, and fortunately for everyone, he was so busy with his courtship that they were free of his company for much of the time.</t2092> <t2093>He spent most of the day at the Lucas house, and sometimes returned to Longbourn just in time to excuse his absence before the family went to bed.</t2093>
<t2094>Mrs. Bennet was truly in a lamentable state.</t2094> <t2095>The mere mention of anything concerning the wedding would put her in a bad mood, and wherever she went, she could be sure to hear about the event.</t2095> <t2096>Seeing Miss Lucas unsettled her.</t2096> <t2097>She looked at her with horror and jealousy, imagining her as her successor in that house.</t2097> <t2098>Whenever Charlotte came to visit them, Mrs. Bennet concluded that she was anticipating the time of taking possession, and every time she whispered something to Collins, she was convinced they were talking about the inheritance of Longbourn and planning to throw her and her daughters out as soon as Mr. Bennet passed away.</t2098> <t2099>She complained about it bitterly to her husband.</t2099>
<t2100>––The truth is, Mr. Bennet ––she said to him––, it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas will one day be the mistress of this house, and that I will be forced to yield my place to her and live seeing her in my position.</t2100>
<t2101>––Dear, don't think about sad things.</t2101> <t2102>Let's have hope for better things.</t2102> <t2103>Let's cheer up with the idea that I can outlive you.</t2103>
<t2104>It was not very comforting, to say the least, for Mrs. Bennet; however, instead of replying, she continued:</t2104>
<t2105>––I can't bear the thought of them becoming the owners of all this property.</t2105> <t2106>If it weren't for the inheritance, I wouldn't care.</t2106>
<t2107>––What is it that you couldn't care less about?</t2107>
<t2108>––I wouldn't care about absolutely anything.</t2108>
<t2109>––Let's give thanks, then, that they save you from such a state of insensitivity.</t2109>
<t2110>––I will never be able to give thanks for anything related to the inheritance.</t2110> <t2111>I will never understand how someone can have a clear conscience disinheriting their own daughters.</t2111> <t2112>And to top it off, the heir has to be Mr. Collins!</t2112> <t2113>Why him, and not anyone else?</t2113>
<t2114>––I leave it to your own consideration.</t2114>
<t2115>CHAPTER XXIV</t2115>
<t2116>The letter from Miss Bingley arrived and put an end to all doubts.</t2116> <t2117>The first sentence already conveyed that everyone had settled in London for the winter, and at the end, it expressed the brother's regret for not having had time, before leaving the countryside, to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire.</t2117>
<t2118>There was no hope, it had completely vanished.</t2118> <t2119>Jane continued reading, but found few things, aside from the expressions of affection from her author, that could provide her any relief.</t2119> <t2120>The rest of the letter was almost entirely dedicated to praising Miss Darcy.</t2120> <t2121>It insisted again on her many charms, and Caroline boasted very happily about her growing intimacy with her, venturing to predict the fulfillment of the wishes she had already expressed in the first letter.</t2121> <t2122>She also joyfully recounted that her brother was close to the Darcy family, and enthusiastically mentioned certain plans of the latter, related to the new furniture.</t2122>
<t2123>Elizabeth, to whom Jane immediately communicated the most important parts of the news, listened in silence and with great indignation.</t2123> <t2124>Her heart wavered between concern for her sister and hatred for everyone else.</t2124> <t2125>She did not believe Caroline's assertion that her brother was interested in Miss Darcy.</t2125> <t2126>She never doubted, as she had never doubted before, that Bingley was in love with Jane; but Elizabeth, who had always had so much sympathy for him, could not think without anger, and even without contempt, of that weakness of character and lack of decision that made him a slave to his scheming friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the whims of their desires.</t2126> <t2127>If he were only sacrificing his own happiness, he could play with it as he pleased; but it also involved Jane's happiness, and she thought he should take that into account.</t2127> <t2128>In the end, it was one of those things that it is useless to break one's head over.</t2128>
<t2129>Elizabeth could think of nothing else; and whether Bingley's interest had truly died, or had been hindered by the interference of his friends; whether Bingley was aware of Jane's affection, or it had gone unnoticed by him; in any case, and although Elizabeth's opinion of Bingley might vary depending on the differences, Jane's situation remained the same and her peace had been disturbed.</t2129>
<t2130>A day or two passed before Jane had the courage to confess her feelings to her sister; but finally, in a moment when Mrs. Bennet had left them alone after becoming more irritated than usual with the subject of Netherfield and its owner, the young woman could not resist and exclaimed:</t2130>
<t2131>––If my dear mother had more self-control!</t2131> <t2132>You cannot imagine how much her constant comments about Mr. Bingley hurt me.</t2132> <t2133>But I will not be sad.</t2133> <t2134>It cannot last long.</t2134> <t2135>I will forget it and we will all be as we were before.</t2135>
<t2136>Elizabeth, solicitous and incredulous, looked at her sister, but said nothing.</t2136>
<t2137>––Do you doubt it? ––asked Jane, slightly blushing––.</t2137> <t2138>You have no reason to.</t2138> <t2139>I will always remember him as the best man I have ever known, that's all.</t2139> <t2140>I have nothing to hope for nor to fear, and I have nothing to reproach him for.</t2140> <t2141>Thank God, I am spared that sorrow.</t2141> <t2142>So, in a short time, I will be much better.</t2142>
<t2143>In a louder voice, he added afterwards:</t2143>
<t2144>––I have the consolation of thinking that it was nothing more than an error of imagination on my part and that it has harmed no one but myself.</t2144>
<t2145>––Dear Jane! ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t2145> <t2146>You are too good.</t2146> <t2147>Your sweetness and selflessness are truly angelic.</t2147> <t2148>I don't know what to say to you.</t2148> <t2149>I feel as if I have never done you justice, or as if I have not loved you as much as you deserve.</t2149>
<t2150>Jane vehemently denied having any extraordinary merit and rejected her sister's praises, which were only a product of her great affection.</t2150>
<t2151>––No ––said Elizabeth––, that is not right.</t2151> <t2152>Everyone seems respectable to you and you get offended if I speak ill of someone.</t2152> <t2153>You are the only one I find perfect and you don't want me to tell you that either.</t2153> <t2154>Do not fear that I will exceed by appropriating your privilege of universal kindness.</t2154> <t2155>There is no danger.</t2155> <t2156>I truly care for very few people, and I have a good opinion of very few.</t2156> <t2157>The more I know the world, the more it displeases me, and time confirms my belief in the inconsistency of human character, and in how little one can trust the appearances of goodness or intelligence.</t2157> <t2158>Lately, I have had two examples: one that I do not want to mention, and the other, Charlotte's wedding.</t2158> <t2159>It's incredible!</t2159> <t2160>No matter how you look at it, it's incredible!</t2160>
<t2161>––Dear Lizzy, you must not have those feelings, they will end your happiness.</t2161> <t2162>You do not take into consideration the different situations and the nature of people.</t2162> <t2163>Keep in mind the respectability of Mr. Collins and the firm and prudent character of Charlotte.</t2163> <t2164>Remember that she belongs to a large family, and as far as fortune is concerned, it is a very desirable marriage. You must believe, for God's sake, that she might feel some affection and esteem for our cousin.</t2164>
<t2165>––To please you, I would try to believe what you say, but no one would benefit, because if I suspected that Charlotte had any interest in Mr. Collins, I would think less of her intelligence than I currently do of her heart.</t2165> <t2166>Dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pedantic, stubborn, and foolish man; you know this as well as I do; and you must also know, as I do, that the woman who marries him cannot be in her right mind.</t2166> <t2167>Do not defend her just because she is Charlotte Lucas.</t2167> <t2168>For the sake of one person, you should not distort the meaning of principle and integrity, nor try to convince yourself or me that selfishness is prudence or that insensitivity to danger is a guarantee of happiness.</t2168>
<t2169>––You speak of both with too much harshness ––replied Jane––, and I hope you will admit it when you see that they are happy together.</t2169> <t2170>But let's leave this aside.</t2170> <t2171>You alluded to something else.</t2171> <t2172>You mentioned two examples.</t2172> <t2173>I know what it's about, but I beg you, dear Lizzy, not to make me suffer by blaming that person and saying that you have lost the good opinion you had of him.</t2173> <t2174>We should not be so inclined to imagine that we have been intentionally hurt.</t2174> <t2175>We cannot expect a young and so vital man to always be so circumspect and restrained.</t2175> <t2176>Often what deceives us is only our own vanity.</t2176> <t2177>We women believe that admiration means more than it actually does.</t2177>
<t2178>––And men make sure that it is so.</t2178>
<t2179>––If they do it deliberately, they have no justification; but it seems to me that there is not as much premeditation in the world as many people imagine.</t2179>
<t2180>––I do not mean to attribute Mr. Bingley's conduct to premeditation; but without intending to do wrong or cause others to suffer, one can make mistakes and do a great deal of harm.</t2180> <t2181>Inattention, disregard for the feelings of others, and indecision are responsible for that.</t2181>
<t2182>––Do you attribute what happened to any of that?</t2182>
<t2183>––Yes, at the end.</t2183> <t2184>But if I keep talking, I will upset you by saying what I think of people you hold in high regard.</t2184> <t2185>It's better if you try to make me stay quiet.</t2185>
<t2186>Do you still suppose, then, that the sisters influence him?</t2186>
<t2187>––Yes, along with his friend.</t2187>
<t2188>––I can't believe it.</t2188> <t2189>Why would he do it?</t2189> <t2190>They can only wish for his happiness; and if he loves me, no other woman will be able to provide it.</t2190>
<t2191>Your first assumption is false.</t2191> <t2192>They may desire many things besides their happiness; they may desire to increase their wealth, with all that it brings; they may desire for you to marry a girl who has all the importance that money, great families, and pride can give.</t2192>
<t2193>––So, you mean that they want me to choose Miss Darcy ––replied Jane––; but perhaps they are driven by better intentions than you think.</t2193> <t2194>They have spent much more time with her than with me, it's logical that they would like her more.</t2194> <t2195>But whatever their wishes may be, it is very unlikely that they have opposed their brother's.</t2195> <t2196>What sister would believe she has the right to do so, unless there was something very serious to object to?</t2196> <t2197>If they had seen that he was very interested in me, they would not have tried to separate us; and if he were indeed that interested, all their efforts would be useless.</t2197> <t2198>By assuming that he loves me, you only manage to attribute bad behavior and a wrong attitude to everyone and make me suffer even more.</t2198> <t2199>I am not ashamed of having been wrong, and if I were ashamed, my suffering would be nothing compared to the pain that thinking ill of Bingley or his sisters would cause me.</t2199> <t2200>Let me interpret it in the best possible way, in the way that makes it most understandable.</t2200>
<t2201>Elizabeth could not oppose such wishes; and from then on, the name of Bingley was seldom mentioned between them.</t2201>
<t2202>Mrs. Bennet was still puzzled and murmuring upon seeing that Bingley did not return; and although not a day went by without Elizabeth clearly showing her what was happening, it seemed that the mother could not stop being puzzled.</t2202> <t2203>Her daughter tried to convince her of what she herself did not believe, telling her that Bingley's attentions towards Jane had been the result of a common and fleeting whim that ceased once he stopped seeing her; but although Mrs. Bennet did not hesitate to admit that possibility, she could not help but repeat the same story every day.</t2203> <t2204>The only thing that consoled her was that Bingley had to return in the summer.</t2204>
<t2205>Mr. Bennet saw the matter in a very different light.</t2205>
<t2206>So, Lizzy ––he said one day––, your sister has had a romantic failure.</t2206> <t2207>I congratulate her.</t2207> <t2208>Before getting married, it's good for a girl to have some failure; it gives her something to think about, and it gives her a certain distinction among her friends.</t2208> <t2209>And you, when is it your turn?</t2209> <t2210>You wouldn't want to be less than Jane.</t2210>
<t2211>Take advantage now.</t2211> <t2212>There are enough officers in Meryton to deceive all the girls in the area.</t2212> <t2213>Choose Wickham.</t2213> <t2214>He is a pleasant fellow, and he is sure to reject you.</t2214>
<t2215>––Thank you, Dad, but I would be satisfied with a less pleasant man.</t2215> <t2216>Not all of us can expect to be as lucky as Jane.</t2216>
<t2217>––It is true ––said Mr. Bennet––, but it is a comfort to think that, whatever happens, you have a loving mother who will always help you.</t2217>
<t2218>Wickham's company was of great utility in dispelling the sadness that the recent unfortunate events had caused several members of the Longbourn family.</t2218> <t2219>They saw him often, and on that occasion, he added to his other virtues that of absolute frankness.</t2219> <t2220>Everything Elizabeth had heard, his complaints against Darcy and the grievances he had inflicted upon him, became public knowledge; everyone delighted in recalling how disagreeable Darcy had always been, even before knowing any of this.</t2220>
<t2221>Jane was the only one capable of supposing that there might be some mitigating circumstance in this case unknown to the neighbors of Hertfordshire.</t2221> <t2222>Her sweet and unwavering candor constantly called for indulgence and proposed the possibility of a mistake; but everyone considered Darcy to be the worst of men.</t2222>
<t2223>CHAPTER XXV</t2223>
<t2224>After a week spent between promises of love and plans of happiness, Collins had to bid farewell to his beloved Charlotte to arrive on Saturday at Hunsford.</t2224> <t2225>But the sorrow of the separation was alleviated for Collins by the preparations he had to make for the reception of his fiancée; for he had reasons to believe that shortly after his next return to Hertfordshire, the day would be set that would make him the happiest of men.</t2225> <t2226>He bid farewell to his relatives at Longbourn with the same solemnity as before; once again wished his beautiful cousins health and happiness, and promised the father another letter of gratitude.</t2226>
<t2227>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend Christmas at Longbourn.</t2227> <t2228>Mr. Gardiner was an intelligent and gentlemanly man, far superior to his sister by nature and education.</t2228> <t2229>The ladies of Netherfield would have found it difficult to believe that this man, who lived off commerce and was always involved in his warehouse, could be so well-educated and pleasant.</t2229> <t2230>Mrs. Gardiner, much younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Philips, was a charming and elegant woman, adored by her nieces at Longbourn.</t2230> <t2231>Especially the two eldest, with whom she had a particular friendship.</t2231> <t2232>Elizabeth and Jane had often been to her house in the capital.</t2232> <t2233>The first thing Mrs. Gardiner did upon arriving was to distribute her gifts and describe the new fashions.</t2233> <t2234>Once this was done, she ceased to lead the conversation; now it was her turn to listen.</t2234> <t2235>Mrs. Bennet had to tell her about her many misfortunes and complaints.</t2235> <t2236>She had suffered many humiliations since the last time she saw her sister-in-law.</t2236> <t2237>Two of her daughters had been on the verge of getting married, but then everything had come to nothing.</t2237>
<t2238>––I do not blame Jane, he continued––, because she would have married Mr. Bingley if she could; but Elizabeth... Ah, my sister! It is very hard to think that at this hour she could be Mrs. Collins if it hadn't been for her stubbornness.</t2238> <t2239>He proposed to her in this very room and she rejected him.</t2239> <t2240>As a consequence, Lady Lucas will have a married daughter before I do, and the Longbourn inheritance will pass into their hands.</t2240> <t2241>The Lucases are very shrewd, they always take advantage of what they can.</t2241> <t2242>I regret having to speak of them in this way but it is the truth.</t2242> <t2243>It makes me very nervous and sick that my own family contradicts me in this way, and to have neighbors who think only of themselves.</t2243> <t2244>At least having you here at this very moment comforts me greatly; I love what you tell us about the long sleeves.</t2244>
<t2245>Mrs. Gardiner, who had already heard about the matter through the correspondence she maintained with Jane and Elizabeth, gave a brief response, and out of compassion for her nieces, changed the subject.</t2245>
<t2246>When he was alone later with Elizabeth, he brought up the matter again:</t2246>
<t2247>––It seems that it would have been a good match for Jane ––he said––.</t2247> <t2248>I regret that it has been ruined.</t2248> <t2249>But these things happen so often!</t2249> <t2250>A young man like Bingley, as you describe him to me, easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and, if by chance they part, he forgets her just as easily.</t2250> <t2251>Such inconstancies are very common.</t2251>
<t2252>––If that had been the case, it would be a great comfort ––said Elizabeth––, but our situation is different.</t2252> <t2253>What happened to us was not by chance.</t2253> <t2254>It is not so common for friends to intervene and convince an independent young man to stop thinking about a girl he was madly in love with just a few days before.</t2254>
<t2255>––But that expression, "madly in love," is so overused, so ambiguous and so vague, that it tells me nothing.</t2255> <t2256>The same applies to feelings born half an hour after meeting, as to a strong and true affection.</t2256> <t2257>Explain to me what Mr. Bingley's love was like.</t2257>
<t2258>––I have never seen a more promising attraction.</t2258> <t2259>When he was with Jane, he paid no attention to anyone else, he devoted himself entirely to her.</t2259> <t2260>Every time they saw each other, it became more certain and evident.</t2260> <t2261>At his own ball, he snubbed two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance, and I spoke to him twice without getting a response.</t2261> <t2262>Could there be clearer symptoms?</t2262> <t2263>Isn't rudeness to everyone else the very essence of love?</t2263>
<t2264>––Of that kind of love that I imagine Bingley felt, yes.</t2264> <t2265>Poor Jane!</t2265> <t2266>I feel sorry for her, because given her nature, she won't forget so easily.</t2266> <t2267>It would have been better if it had happened to you, Lizzy; you would have resigned yourself sooner.</t2267> <t2268>But, do you think we can convince her to come with us to London?</t2268> <t2269>A change of air would do her good, and maybe a little rest away from home would be better for her than anything else.</t2269>
<t2270>Elizabeth found this proposition wonderful and did not doubt that her sister would accept it.</t2270>
<t2271>––I suppose ––he added–– that thinking she might meet that young man won't stop her.</t2271> <t2272>We live in opposite parts of the city, all our friends are so different and, as you know, we go out so little, that it's very unlikely to happen, unless he comes expressly to see her.</t2272>
<t2273>––And that is impossible, because now he is under the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would not allow him to visit Jane in such a part of London.</t2273> <t2274>Dear aunt, what do you think?</t2274> <t2275>Darcy might have heard of a place like Gracechurch Street, but he would believe that not even the ablutions of a whole month would be enough to cleanse him of all its impurities, if he ever deigned to enter that street.</t2275> <t2276>And you can be sure that Bingley would not take a step without him.</t2276>
<t2277>––Much better.</t2277> <t2278>I hope they never meet.</t2278> <t2279>But, doesn't Jane write to her sister?</t2279> <t2280>Then, Miss Bingley will have no excuse not to visit her.</t2280>
<t2281>––He will completely break off their friendship.</t2281>
<t2282>But, despite Elizabeth being so sure about this point, and, what was even more interesting, despite Bingley being prevented from seeing Jane, Mrs. Gardiner was convinced, after examining it well, that there was still hope.</t2282> <t2283>It was possible, and sometimes she believed even beneficial, that Bingley's affection could be rekindled and fight against the influence of his friends under the more natural influence of Jane's charms.</t2283>
<t2284>Jane gladly accepted her aunt's invitation, without thinking about the Bingleys, although she hoped that, since Caroline did not live in the same house as her brother, she might spend a morning with her without the danger of encountering him.</t2284>
<t2285>The Gardiners stayed in Longbourn for a week; and among the Philipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without an engagement.</t2285> <t2286>Mrs. Bennet had taken such care to prepare everything so that her brother and sister-in-law would have a good time, that not once could they enjoy a family meal.</t2286> <t2287>When the gathering was at home, there were always some officers present among whom Wickham could not be absent.</t2287> <t2288>On these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, who was curious about the many praises Elizabeth bestowed upon him, observed the two of them closely.</t2288> <t2289>Realizing, from what she saw, that they were not seriously in love; their mutual preference was too evident.</t2289> <t2290>She did not feel very at ease, so before leaving Hertfordshire she decided to speak with Elizabeth about the matter, warning her of her imprudence in encouraging that relationship.</t2290>
<t2291>Wickham, aside from his qualities, knew how to please Mrs. Gardiner.</t2291> <t2292>Before getting married, ten or twelve years ago, she had spent quite some time in the same part of Derbyshire where Wickham was born.</t2292> <t2293>They therefore had many mutual friends; and although Wickham left shortly after the death of Darcy's father, which occurred five years ago, he could still tell her things about their old friends, more recent than what she knew.</t2293>
<t2294>Mrs. Gardiner had been to Pemberley and had known the late Mr. Darcy perfectly.</t2294> <t2295>This was, therefore, an inexhaustible topic of conversation.</t2295> <t2296>She compared her memories of Pemberley with the detailed description Wickham gave, and by praising the character of its last owner, they both delighted in it.</t2296> <t2297>Upon learning of Darcy's behavior with Wickham, Mrs. Gardiner believed she remembered something of the bad reputation he had when he was still a boy, which fit this case; finally, she confessed that she remembered that even then young Fitzwilliam Darcy was spoken of as a bad and proud boy.</t2297>
<t2298>CHAPTER XXVI</t2298>
<t2299>Mrs. Gardiner gave Elizabeth the aforementioned warning promptly and kindly, at the first opportunity she had to speak with her alone.</t2299> <t2300>After having honestly told her what she thought, she added:</t2300>
<t2301>––You are a girl too sensible, Lizzy, to fall in love just because you were warned not to; and for that reason, I dare to speak to you openly.</t2301> <t2302>Seriously, be careful.</t2302> <t2303>Do not commit yourself, nor let him get involved in an affection that the lack of fortune can turn into imprudence.</t2303> <t2304>I have nothing to say against him; he is a very interesting young man, and if he had the position he should have, he would seem unbeatable to me.</t2304> <t2305>But as things stand, you cannot blind yourself.</t2305> <t2306>You have a lot of sense, and we all expect you to use it.</t2306> <t2307>Your father trusts in your firmness and good conduct.</t2307> <t2308>Do not disappoint him.</t2308>
<t2309>––Dear aunt, this is really serious.</t2309>
<t2310>––Yes, and I hope you take it seriously too.</t2310>
<t2311>––Well, don't be alarmed.</t2311> <t2312>I will take care of Wickham.</t2312> <t2313>If I can avoid it, he will not fall in love with me.</t2313>
<t2314>––Elizabeth, you can't be serious.</t2314>
<t2315>––Forgive me.</t2315> <t2316>I will try again.</t2316> <t2317>For now, I am not in love with Wickham; it's true, I am not.</t2317> <t2318>But he is, without comparison, the most pleasant man I have ever seen; so much so, that I wouldn't mind if he felt attracted to me.</t2318> <t2319>I know it is imprudent.</t2319> <t2320>Oh, that abominable Darcy!</t2320> <t2321>The opinion my father has of me honors me; and it would grieve me greatly to lose it.</t2321> <t2322>However, my father is a supporter of Mr. Wickham.</t2322> <t2323>In short, dear aunt, I would be very sorry to make any of you suffer; but when we see daily that young people, if they are in love, usually disregard the lack of fortune when committing, how could I promise to be wiser than so many of my peers if I found myself tempted?</t2323> <t2324>Or how would I know that I would act wisely if I resist?</t2324> <t2325>So the only thing I can promise you is that I will not rush.</t2325> <t2326>I will not hasten to believe that I am the woman of his dreams.</t2326> <t2327>When I am by his side, I will not show him that I like him.</t2327> <t2328>In other words, I will behave as best as I can.</t2328>
<t2329>––Maybe you would achieve it, if you try to make sure he doesn't come here so often.</t2329> <t2330>At the very least, you shouldn't remind your mother to invite him.</t2330>
<t2331>––As I did the other day ––replied Elizabeth with a malicious smile––.</t2331> <t2332>It's true, it would be the most appropriate.</t2332> <t2333>But don't go imagining that he comes so often.</t2333> <t2334>If we've invited him so much this week, it's because you were here.</t2334> <t2335>You know my mother's obsession with having her guests constantly accompanied.</t2335> <t2336>But truly, I give you my word that I will always try to do what I believe is most sensible.</t2336> <t2337>I hope you are happier now.</t2337>
<t2338>Her aunt assured her that she was; Elizabeth thanked her for her kind warnings, and they left.</t2338> <t2339>Their conversation had been an admirable example of how to give advice without causing resentment.</t2339>
<t2340>Shortly after the Gardiners and Jane had left, Collins returned to Hertfordshire; but since he went to the Lucas house, Mrs. Bennet was not bothered by his arrival.</t2340> <t2341>The wedding was approaching, and Mrs. Bennet had resigned herself so much that she already considered it inevitable and even repeated, albeit in a bad mood, that she wished them to be happy.</t2341> <t2342>The wedding was to be held on Thursday, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas came to make her farewell visit.</t2342> <t2343>When the young woman got up to leave, Elizabeth, sincerely moved and embarrassed by her mother's inattentive attitude and feigned good wishes, left the room with her and accompanied her to the door.</t2343> <t2344>As they were going down the stairs, Charlotte said:</t2344>
<t2345>––I trust that I will hear from you very often, Eliza.</t2345>
<t2346>––You will have them.</t2346>
<t2347>––And I want to ask you another favor.</t2347> <t2348>Will you come to see me?</t2348>
<t2349>––We will see each other often in Hertfordshire, I hope.</t2349>
<t2350>––It seems to me that I won't be able to leave Kent for a while.</t2350> <t2351>Therefore, promise me to come to Hunsford.</t2351>
<t2352>Despite how little she liked the visit, Elizabeth could not refuse Charlotte's invitation.</t2352>
<t2353>––My father and María will come to see me in March ––––added Charlotte–– and I would like you to accompany them.</t2353> <t2354>I assure you, Eliza, that you will be as well received as they are.</t2354>
<t2355>The wedding took place; the groom and the bride departed for Kent from the church door, and everyone had some comment to make or hear on the matter, as usual.</t2355> <t2356>Elizabeth soon received a letter from her friend, and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as ever.</t2356> <t2357>But no longer as frank.</t2357> <t2358>It was impossible for Elizabeth to address Charlotte without noticing that all her former confidence had disappeared, and although she did not want to interrupt the correspondence, she did so more for what their friendship had been than for what it actually was now.</t2358> <t2359>Charlotte’s first letters were received with much impatience; she was very curious to see what she would say about her new home, to know if she would have liked Lady Catherine and to what extent she would dare to confess that she was happy.</t2359> <t2360>But upon reading those letters, Elizabeth observed that Charlotte expressed herself exactly as she had anticipated.</t2360> <t2361>She wrote cheerfully, seemed to be surrounded by comforts, and did not mention anything that was not worthy of praise.</t2361> <t2362>The house, the furniture, the neighborhood, and the roads, everything was to her liking, and Lady Catherine could not be more sociable and attentive.</t2362> <t2363>It was the same portrait of Hunsford and Rosings that Mr. Collins had made, although reasonably mitigated.</t2363> <t2364>Elizabeth understood that she would have to wait for her own visit to learn the rest.</t2364>
<t2365>Jane had already sent a few lines to her sister announcing her happy arrival in London; and when she wrote to her again, Elizabeth hoped that she would be able to tell her something about the Bingleys.</t2365>
<t2366>Her impatience for this second letter received the usual reward for all impatience: Jane had been in the capital for a week without having seen or heard anything from Caroline.</t2366> <t2367>However, she explained it by assuming that the last letter she sent to her friend from Longbourn must have been lost.</t2367>
<t2368>“My aunt,” he continued, “will go to that part of the city tomorrow, and I will have the opportunity to visit Caroline on Grosvenor Street.”</t2368>
<t2369>After the mentioned visit, in which she saw Miss Bingley, Jane wrote again: "Caroline was not in a good mood, but she was very happy to see me and reproached me for not notifying her of my arrival in London.</t2369> <t2370>Therefore, I was right: she had not received my letter.</t2370> <t2371>Naturally, I asked her about her brother.</t2371> <t2372>She told me he was well, but that he is so busy with Mr. Darcy that she barely sees him.</t2372> <t2373>They were expecting Miss Darcy for lunch by chance; I would like to see her.</t2373> <t2374>My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst had to go out.</t2374> <t2375>I suppose they will come to see me soon."</t2375>
<t2376>Elizabeth shook her head as she read the letter.</t2376> <t2377>She saw clearly that only by chance could Bingley discover that Jane was in London.</t2377>
<t2378>Four weeks passed without Jane knowing anything about him.</t2378> <t2379>She tried to convince herself that she did not regret it; but what she could no longer be blind to was Miss Bingley's indifference.</t2379> <t2380>After waiting for her at home every morning for fifteen days and inventing an excuse for her every afternoon, she finally received her visit; but the brevity of it and, moreover, her strange attitude did not allow Jane to continue deceiving herself.</t2380> <t2381>The letter she then wrote to her sister demonstrated what she felt:</t2381>
<t2382>I am sure, my dearest Lizzy, that you will be unable to boast at my expense about your good judgment when I confess that I have been completely disillusioned with Miss Bingley's affection.</t2382> <t2383>Anyway, although the facts have proven you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, given her behavior towards me, my trust was as natural as your suspicions.</t2383> <t2384>Despite everything, I cannot understand why she wanted to be my friend; but if things were to happen again, I have no doubt that I would be deceived once more.</t2384> <t2385>Caroline did not return my visit until yesterday, and in the meantime, I did not receive a single note or line from her.</t2385> <t2386>When she came, it was quite clear that it was against her will; she gave a slight, merely formal excuse for not having come earlier; she did not say a word about when we would see each other again and was so upset that, when she left, I firmly decided to put an end to our relationship.</t2386> <t2387>I feel sorry, although I cannot help but blame her.</t2387> <t2388>She was wrong to choose me as a friend.</t2388> <t2389>But I can safely say that it was she who took the first step to become close to me.</t2389> <t2390>Anyway, I pity her because she must understand that she has behaved very badly, and because I am sure that her concern for her brother was the cause of everything.</t2390> <t2391>And although we know that this concern is unnecessary, the fact of feeling it justifies her attitude towards me, and since he fully deserves his sister's adoration, all the anxiety he inspires in her is natural and appreciable.</t2391> <t2392>But I cannot help but wonder why she continues to have these fears, for if he had been interested in me, we would have seen each other a long time ago.</t2392> <t2393>He knows that I am in the city; I deduce this from something she herself said; and still, it seemed, by her way of speaking, that she needed to convince herself that Bingley is really interested in Miss Darcy.</t2393> <t2394>I do not understand it.</t2394> <t2395>If I did not fear judging harshly, I would almost say that there is more to this than meets the eye.</t2395> <t2396>But I will try to dispel all these painful thoughts and think only of what makes me happy: your affection and the unalterable kindness of our dear uncles.</t2396> <t2397>Write to me soon.</t2397> <t2398>Miss Bingley spoke of never returning to Netherfield and of getting rid of the house, but not with much certainty.</t2398> <t2399>It is better not to mention these things.</t2399> <t2400>I am very glad that you have had such good news from our friends in Hunsford.</t2400> <t2401>Please go to see them with Sir William and Maria.</t2401> <t2402>I am sure you will be well there.</t2402>
<t2403>Yours,</t2403>
<t2404>Jane</t2404>
<t2405>Elizabeth felt a bit sorry about this letter, but she regained her spirits by thinking that at least she would no longer be fooled by Miss Bingley.</t2405> <t2406>All hope regarding the brother had completely vanished.</t2406> <t2407>She didn't even wish for their relationship to be renewed.</t2407> <t2408>Every time she thought of him, his character disappointed her more.</t2408> <t2409>And as a punishment for him and for Jane's benefit, Elizabeth wished he would marry Mr. Darcy's sister as soon as possible, for, according to what Wickham said, she would make him regret greatly what he had scorned.</t2409>
<t2410>Meanwhile, Mrs. Gardiner reminded Elizabeth of her promise regarding Wickham and wanted to know how things were going.</t2410> <t2411>Elizabeth's news was more favorable for her aunt than for herself.</t2411> <t2412>Wickham's apparent interest had disappeared, as had his attentions.</t2412> <t2413>Now it was another whom he admired.</t2413> <t2414>Elizabeth was observant enough to notice everything, but she saw it and wrote about it without much sorrow.</t2414> <t2415>It had not made much of an impression on her heart, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his favorite if her fortune had allowed it.</t2415> <t2416>The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most notable charm of the young woman to whom Wickham now paid his attention.</t2416> <t2417>But Elizabeth, perhaps less perceptive in this case than in Charlotte's, did not blame him for his desire for independence.</t2417> <t2418>On the contrary, it seemed the most natural thing in the world to her, and as she presumed it cost him some effort to give her up, she was willing to consider it the wisest and most desirable measure for both, and could sincerely wish him much happiness.</t2418>
<t2419>She communicated all this to Mrs. Gardiner; and after recounting all the details, she added: "I am convinced, dear aunt, that I have never been truly in love, for if I had really felt that pure and elevated passion of love, I would detest even his name and wish him the greatest misfortunes.</t2419> <t2420>But not only do I still appreciate him, I do not feel any aversion towards Miss King.</t2420> <t2421>I do not hate her, I do not want to believe she is a bad girl.</t2421> <t2422>This cannot be love.</t2422> <t2423>My precautions have been effective; and although my friends would worry much more about me if I were madly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my relative insignificance.</t2423> <t2424>Importance is sometimes paid for too dearly.</t2424> <t2425>Kitty and Lydia take Wickham's betrayal more to heart than I do.</t2425> <t2426>They are still too young to see the reality of the world and to acquire the humiliating conviction that handsome men must have something to live on, just like the ugly ones."</t2426>
<t2427>CHAPTER XXVII/h3></t2427>
<t2428>Without any significant events in the Longbourn family, and with no more variation than walks to Meryton, sometimes muddy and sometimes cold, the months of January and February passed.</t2428> <t2429>March was the month in which Elizabeth would go to Hunsford.</t2429> <t2430>At first, she did not seriously think of going.</t2430> <t2431>But she saw that Charlotte took it for granted, and little by little she became pleasantly accustomed to the idea until she decided to go.</t2431> <t2432>With the absence, her desire to see Charlotte had increased and her aversion to Collins had diminished.</t2432> <t2433>The project involved a certain novelty, and since with such a mother and such unbearable sisters, her home was not a very pleasant place, she could not disregard this change of scenery.</t2433> <t2434>The trip also provided her with the pleasure of going to give Jane a hug; so much so that when the date approached, she would have regretted having to postpone it.</t2434>
<t2435>But everything went smoothly and the trip was carried out according to Charlotte's plans.</t2435> <t2436>Elizabeth would accompany Sir William and his second daughter.</t2436> <t2437>And to top it off, they decided to spend a night in London; the plan was so perfect that nothing more could be asked for.</t2437>
<t2438>The only thing that saddened Elizabeth was parting from her father, because she knew he would miss her, and when the time came to leave, he became so sad that he asked his daughter to write to him and even promised to reply to her letter.</t2438>
<t2439>The farewell between Wickham and Elizabeth was very cordial, even more so on Wickham's part.</t2439> <t2440>Although at that moment he was occupied with other things, he could not forget that she was the first to excite and deserve his attention, the first to listen to him and sympathize with him, and the first to please him.</t2440> <t2441>And in his manner of saying goodbye, wishing her well, reminding her of what Lady Catherine de Bourgh seemed like to him, and repeating that his opinions about her and everyone else would always coincide, there was such solicitude and interest that Elizabeth felt filled with the most sincere affection towards him and left convinced that she would always consider Wickham, single or married, as a model of sympathy and simplicity.</t2441>
<t2442>Her travel companions for the next day were not the most suitable for Elizabeth to remember Wickham with less displeasure.</t2442> <t2443>Sir William and his daughter Maria, a cheerful girl but as empty-headed as her father, said nothing worth listening to; so hearing them was the same for Elizabeth as hearing the rattling of the carriage.</t2443> <t2444>Elizabeth was amused by the nonsense, but she had known Sir William for too long and he could tell her nothing new about the wonders of his presentation at court and his title of "Sir," and his courtesies were as stale as his news.</t2444>
<t2445>The journey was only twenty-four miles, and they set out so early that by noon they were already on Gracechurch Street.</t2445> <t2446>As they approached the Gardiners' door, Jane was at the sitting room window watching their arrival; when they entered the hall, she was already there to welcome them.</t2446> <t2447>Elizabeth examined her anxiously and was pleased to find her as healthy and charming as ever.</t2447> <t2448>On the stairs, there was a throng of boys and girls too impatient to see their cousin to wait for her in the sitting room, but their shyness kept them from fully descending and going to meet her, as it had been more than a year since they last saw her.</t2448> <t2449>Everything was joy and attentions.</t2449> <t2450>The day passed pleasantly; in the afternoon, they strolled around and visited the shops, and in the evening, they went to a theater.</t2450>
<t2451>Elizabeth then managed to sit next to her aunt.</t2451> <t2452>The first topic of conversation was Jane; after hearing the answers to the detailed questions she asked about her sister, Elizabeth was more saddened than surprised to learn that Jane, although always striving to keep her spirits high, was going through moments of great despondency.</t2452> <t2453>Nevertheless, it was reasonable to expect that they would not last long.</t2453> <t2454>Mrs. Gardiner also told her details of Miss Bingley's visit to Gracechurch, and repeated some conversations she had later with Jane that showed the latter had ended their friendship.</t2454>
<t2455>Mrs. Gardiner consoled her niece for Wickham's betrayal and congratulated her on how well she had taken it.</t2455>
<t2456>––But tell me, dear Elizabeth ––he added––, what kind of girl is Miss King?</t2456> <t2457>I would be very sorry to think that our friend is a fortune hunter.</t2457>
<t2458>––Let's see, dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial matters between selfish motives and prudent ones?</t2458> <t2459>Where does discretion end and greed begin?</t2459> <t2460>Last Christmas you feared he would marry me because it would have been imprudent, and now because he is seeking a young woman with only ten thousand pounds of income, you assume he is a fortune hunter.</t2460>
<t2461>––Just tell me what kind of person Miss King is, and I will be able to form a judgment.</t2461>
<t2462>––I think she is a good girl.</t2462> <t2463>I haven't heard anything bad about her.</t2463>
<t2464>––But he didn't pay her the slightest attention until her grandfather's death made her the owner of that fortune...</t2464>
<t2465>––Of course, why would he do it?</t2465> <t2466>If he couldn't afford to win me over because I had no money, what reason would he have to court a girl who meant nothing to him and was as poor as I was?</t2466>
<t2467>––But it seems improper for him to direct his attentions to her so soon after that event.</t2467>
<t2468>––A man who is in a bad situation does not have time, like others, to observe those elegant delicacies.</t2468> <t2469>Besides, if she does not reproach him, why should we reproach him?</t2469>
<t2470>––The fact that she doesn't care doesn't justify Wickham.</t2470> <t2471>It only shows that this young lady lacks sense or sensitivity.</t2471>
<t2472>––Well ––exclaimed Elizabeth––, as you wish.</t2472> <t2473>Let's say he is a fortune hunter and she is a fool.</t2473>
<t2474>––No, Elizabeth, that's what I don't want.</t2474> <t2475>You know it would hurt me to think badly of a young man who lived so long in Derbyshire.</t2475>
<t2476>––Ah! Well, if that's the case, I have a very poor opinion of the young men who live in Derbyshire, whose close friends, who live in Hertfordshire, are not much better.</t2476> <t2477>I'm fed up with all of them.</t2477> <t2478>Thank God, tomorrow I'm going to a place where I'll meet a man who has no pleasant qualities, who has neither manners nor the ability to be likable.</t2478> <t2479>After all, stupid men are the only ones worth knowing.</t2479>
<t2480>––Watch out, Lizzy!</t2480> <t2481>Those words sound too much like disappointment.</t2481>
<t2482>Before parting ways after finishing the work, Elizabeth had the unexpected joy of being invited by her uncles to accompany them on a trip they were planning to take in the summer.</t2482>
<t2483>––We still don't know how far we will go ––said Mrs. Gardiner––, but we might reach the Lakes.</t2483>
<t2484>No other project could be as pleasing to Elizabeth.</t2484> <t2485>She accepted the invitation instantly, extremely grateful.</t2485>
<t2486>––Dear, dearest aunt, she exclaimed enthusiastically––, what a delight!, what happiness!</t2486> <t2487>You make me come alive again, this gives me strength.</t2487> <t2488>Goodbye to disappointment and resentment!</t2488> <t2489>What are men compared to rocks and mountains?</t2489> <t2490>Oh, what hours of escape we will have!</t2490> <t2491>And when we return, we will not be like those travelers who are unable to give an accurate idea of anything.</t2491> <t2492>We will know where we have gone, and we will remember what we have seen.</t2492> <t2493>The lakes, the rivers, and the mountains will not be confused in our memory, nor will we argue about their relative positions when we want to describe a specific landscape.</t2493> <t2494>Let our first outpourings not be like those of most travelers!</t2494>
<t2495>CHAPTER XXVIII</t2495>
<t2496>The next day everything was new and interesting for Elizabeth.</t2496> <t2497>She was determined to have a good time and was very cheerful, as she had found her sister in very good health, and all the fears she had about her health had vanished.</t2497> <t2498>Moreover, the prospect of a trip to the North was for her a constant source of joy.</t2498>
<t2499>When they left the main road to enter the Hunsford path, everyone's eyes searched for the parsonage and at every turn they thought they were going to see it.</t2499> <t2500>On one side of the path ran the fence of the Rosings estate.</t2500> <t2501>Elizabeth smiled as she remembered everything she had heard about its inhabitants.</t2501>
<t2502>At last, they caught sight of the parsonage.</t2502> <t2503>The garden that extended to the road, the house that stood in the middle, the green palisade, and the laurel hedge indicated that they had arrived.</t2503> <t2504>Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at a small entrance that led to the house through a gravel path, amidst general greetings and smiles.</t2504> <t2505>In a moment, everyone got down from the landau, mutually rejoicing at seeing each other.</t2505> <t2506>Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the sincerest pleasure, and Elizabeth, being received with such affection, was increasingly glad she had come.</t2506> <t2507>She immediately observed that her cousin's manners had not changed with marriage; his rigid courtesy was exactly the same as before, and he kept her at the door for several minutes to ask questions about the entire family.</t2507> <t2508>Without further delay than Collins's remarks to his guests about the neatness of the entrance, they entered the house.</t2508> <t2509>Once in the hall, Collins, with bombastic formality, welcomed them to his humble abode for the second time, repeating point by point his wife's offer to serve them a refreshment.</t2509>
<t2510>Elizabeth was prepared to see him now in his environment, and she couldn't help but think that by showing them the good proportions of the room, its appearance, and its furnishings, Collins was addressing her specifically, as if he wanted to make her feel what she had lost by rejecting him.</t2510> <t2511>But although everything seemed bright and comfortable, Elizabeth could not gratify him with any sign of regret; rather, she marveled that her friend could appear so cheerful with such a companion.</t2511> <t2512>When Collins said something that must have embarrassed his wife, which happened quite often, Elizabeth involuntarily turned her eyes towards Charlotte.</t2512> <t2513>Once or twice she could see that Charlotte blushed slightly; but, for the most part, Charlotte pretended not to hear him.</t2513> <t2514>After sitting for a while, long enough to admire each and every piece of furniture, from the sideboard to the fireplace grate, and to recount the journey and everything that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a walk in the garden, which was large and well laid out and which he personally took care of.</t2514> <t2515>Working in the garden was one of his most respected pleasures; Elizabeth admired the seriousness with which Charlotte spoke of how healthy it was for Collins and confessed that she herself encouraged him to do it whenever possible.</t2515> <t2516>Guiding them through all the paths and corners and barely giving them time to express the praises he demanded, he pointed out all the views with a meticulousness that far exceeded their beauty.</t2516> <t2517>He enumerated the fields that could be seen in all directions and said how many trees were in each one.</t2517> <t2518>But of all the views that his garden, or the countryside, or the entire kingdom could boast of, there was none that could compare to that of Rosings, which was revealed through a clearing in the trees that bordered the estate on the side opposite to the front of his house.</t2518> <t2519>The mansion was pretty, modern, and very well situated, on an elevation of the land.</t2519>
<t2520>From the garden, Collins would have liked to take them to tour his two meadows, but the ladies were not properly shod to walk on the still frozen grass and they declined.</t2520> <t2521>Sir William was the only one who accompanied him.</t2521> <t2522>Charlotte returned to the house with her sister and Elizabeth, probably extremely happy to be able to show it to them without her husband's help.</t2522> <t2523>It was small but well laid out, everything was arranged with order and cleanliness, a merit that Elizabeth attributed to Charlotte.</t2523> <t2524>When one could forget Collins, the house had a more pleasant atmosphere; and from her friend's evident satisfaction, Elizabeth thought she should forget him more often.</t2524>
<t2525>They had already told him that Lady Catherine was still in the country.</t2525> <t2526>She was mentioned again while they were dining, and Collins, joining the conversation, said:</t2526>
<t2527>––Yes, Elizabeth; you will have the honor of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh next Sunday at church, and I don't need to tell you how much you will enjoy it.</t2527> <t2528>She is all affability and condescension, and I have no doubt that she will honor you by speaking to you as soon as the service is over.</t2528> <t2529>I also almost have no doubt that you and my sister-in-law Maria will be included in all the invitations with which she honors us during your stay here.</t2529> <t2530>Her attitude towards my dear Charlotte is most kind.</t2530> <t2531>We dine at Rosings twice a week and she never allows us to walk back.</t2531> <t2532>She always requests her carriage to take us, or rather, one of her carriages, because she has several.</t2532>
<t2533>––Lady Catherine is really a very respectable and affectionate lady ––added Charlotte––, and a very attentive neighbor.</t2533>
<t2534>––Very true, dear; it is exactly what I say: she is a woman who can never be considered with enough deference.</t2534>
<t2535>During the evening, there was almost constant talk about Hertfordshire, and what had already been said in writing was repeated.</t2535> <t2536>Upon retiring, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her room, reflected on Charlotte's well-being and her skill and discretion in making the best of and enduring her husband, acknowledging that she did it very well.</t2536> <t2537>She also thought about how her visit would go, what they would do, the tedious interruptions from Collins, and how much she would enjoy dealing with the Rosings family.</t2537> <t2538>Her vivid imagination planned it all at once.</t2538>
<t2539>The next day, around noon, she was in her room getting ready to go out for a walk, when she heard a sudden noise downstairs that seemed to throw the whole house into confusion.</t2539> <t2540>She listened for a moment and noticed that someone was hurriedly coming up the stairs and calling out to her loudly.</t2540> <t2541>She opened the door and in the hallway she found María, very agitated and out of breath, who exclaimed:</t2541>
<t2542>––Oh, dear Elizabeth! Hurry up, come down to the dining room and you'll see!</t2542> <t2543>I can't tell you what it is.</t2543> <t2544>Run, come at once!</t2544>
<t2545>Elizabeth asked in vain what was happening.</t2545> <t2546>Maria did not want to tell her more; both went to the dining room, whose windows faced the road, to see the marvel.</t2546> <t2547>This consisted simply of two ladies who were standing at the garden gate in a low phaeton.</t2547>
<t2548>––And is that all? ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t2548> <t2549>I was at least expecting the pigs to have invaded the garden, and all I see is Lady Catherine and her daughter!</t2549>
<t2550>––Oh, dear! ––replied María, extremely surprised by the mistake––.</t2550> <t2551>It is not Lady Catherine.</t2551> <t2552>The older one is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them.</t2552> <t2553>The other one is Miss de Bourgh.</t2553> <t2554>Look at her closely.</t2554> <t2555>She is a little creature.</t2555> <t2556>Who would have believed she was so small and so thin!</t2556>
<t2557>––It is rude to have Charlotte at the door with the wind blowing like this.</t2557> <t2558>Why doesn't that young lady come in?</t2558>
<t2559>––Charlotte says she almost never does it.</t2559> <t2560>It would be the greatest of favors if Miss de Bourgh were to enter the house.</t2560>
<t2561>––I like her appearance ––said Elizabeth, thinking about other things––.</t2561> <t2562>She looks sick and ill-tempered.</t2562> <t2563>Yes, she is the right woman for him, she suits him well.</t2563>
<t2564>Collins and his wife were conversing with the two ladies at the garden gate, and Elizabeth was greatly amused watching Sir William at the entrance door, absorbed in the contemplation of the grandeur before him and bowing every time Miss de Bourgh glanced in his direction.</t2564>
<t2565>Once the conversation ended, the ladies continued on their way, and the others entered the house.</t2565> <t2566>Collins, as soon as he saw the two girls, congratulated them on their good fortune.</t2566> <t2567>This good fortune, as Charlotte clarified, was that they were all invited to dine at Rosings the next day.</t2567>
<t2568>CHAPTER XXIX</t2568>
<t2569>Collins's satisfaction with this invitation was complete.</t2569> <t2570>There was nothing that delighted him more than being able to showcase the grandeur of his patroness to his admired guests and to make them see the courtesy with which this lady treated him and his wife; and the fact that he was given an opportunity to do so so soon was an example of Lady Catherine's condescension that he wouldn't know how to thank.</t2570>
<t2571>––I confess ––he said–– that I would not have been surprised if His Lordship had invited us on Sunday to have tea and spend the afternoon at Rosings.</t2571> <t2572>In fact, I was expecting it, because I know his affability.</t2572> <t2573>But who could have imagined such an attention as this?</t2573> <t2574>Who could have imagined that we would receive an invitation to dinner; an invitation, moreover, extended to everyone in the house, so very shortly after you arrived?</t2574>
<t2575>––I am not surprised ––replied Sir William––, because my position in life has allowed me to know the true nature of the great.</t2575> <t2576>In the court, such examples of elegant manners are very common.</t2576>
<t2577>All day long and the following morning, hardly anything else was talked about except the visit to Rosings.</t2577> <t2578>Collins carefully instructed them on what they were going to see, so that the sight of those rooms, so many servants, and such splendid food would not leave them open-mouthed.</t2578>
<t2579>When the ladies went to get dressed, he said to Elizabeth:</t2579>
<t2580>––Do not worry about your attire, dear cousin.</t2580> <t2581>Lady Catherine is far from demanding from us the elegance in dressing that befits her and her daughter.</t2581> <t2582>I would only like to advise you to wear the best outfit you have; there is no need for more.</t2582> <t2583>Lady Catherine will not think ill of you for being dressed simply.</t2583> <t2584>She likes to be reserved the distinction due to her rank.</t2584>
<t2585>While they were getting dressed, Collins went two or three times to knock on the various doors, to recommend that they hurry up, as Lady Catherine was very uncomfortable having to wait to eat.</t2585> <t2586>Such formidable reports about Her Ladyship and her way of living had intimidated Maria Lucas, who was not used to social life, and awaited her entrance into Rosings with the same apprehension that her father had experienced when being presented at St. James.</t2586>
<t2587>Since the weather was good, the half-mile walk through the Rosings estate was very pleasant.</t2587> <t2588>All estates have their beauty and views, and Elizabeth was delighted with everything she saw, although she did not show the enthusiasm that Collins expected, and listened with little interest to his enumeration of the windows on the facade, and the account of what the stained glass had cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.</t2588>
<t2589>As they ascended the staircase leading to the lobby, María's excitement was increasing, and even Sir William was not entirely at ease.</t2589> <t2590>Elizabeth, on the other hand, did not lack courage.</t2590> <t2591>She had not heard anything about Lady Catherine that made her believe she possessed any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtues, and she knew that the mere majesty of money and lineage would not make her lose her composure.</t2591>
<t2592>From the entrance hall, whose harmonious proportions and delicate ornamentation Collins enthusiastically pointed out, the servants led them, through an antechamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were.</t2592> <t2593>Her Ladyship rose with great kindness to receive them.</t2593> <t2594>And as Mrs. Collins had agreed with her husband that she would make the introductions, they took place normally, without the excuses or expressions of gratitude that he would have deemed necessary.</t2594>
<t2595>Despite having been to St. James, Sir William was so overwhelmed by the grandeur surrounding him that he barely had the courage to make a deep bow and sat down without saying a word.</t2595> <t2596>His daughter, frightened and beside herself, also sat on the edge of a chair, not knowing where to look.</t2596> <t2597>Elizabeth was as usual, and was able to calmly observe the three ladies in front of her.</t2597> <t2598>Lady Catherine was a very tall and stout woman, with extremely pronounced features that must have been beautiful in her youth.</t2598> <t2599>She had an air of sufficiency, and her manner of receiving them was not the most appropriate to make her guests forget their inferior rank.</t2599> <t2600>When she was silent, she was not at all terrible; but when she spoke, she did so in such an authoritative tone that her importance became overwhelming.</t2600> <t2601>Elizabeth remembered Wickham, and her observations during the evening confirmed that Lady Catherine was exactly as he had described her.</t2601>
<t2602>After examining the mother, in whose countenance and behavior he immediately found a certain resemblance to Darcy, he turned his eyes towards the daughter, and was almost as astonished as Maria to see her so thin and so small.</t2602> <t2603>Both her figure and her face had nothing to do with her mother.</t2603> <t2604>Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, although not ugly, were insignificant; she spoke little and only whispered to Mrs. Jenkinson, whose appearance was unremarkable and who did nothing but listen to what the girl said to her and place a screen in the right direction to protect her eyes from the sun.</t2604>
<t2605>After sitting for a few minutes, they were taken to one of the windows to admire the view; Mr. Collins accompanied them to properly point out its beauty, and Lady Catherine kindly informed them that in summer the view was much better.</t2605>
<t2606>The dinner was excellent, and all the servants and the silverware that Collins had promised were brought out; and just as he had predicted, he took a seat at the head of the table at Her Ladyship's request, making it seem as if life had nothing more important to offer him.</t2606> <t2607>He carved, ate, and praised everything with delight and alacrity.</t2607> <t2608>Each dish was first praised by him and then by Sir William, who had recovered enough to echo everything his son-in-law said, so much so that Elizabeth couldn't understand how Lady Catherine could tolerate them.</t2608> <t2609>But Lady Catherine seemed pleased with such excessive admiration and smiled kindly, especially when a dish was new to them.</t2609> <t2610>The others said almost nothing.</t2610> <t2611>Elizabeth was ready to speak as soon as she was given the opportunity; but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh, and the former was busy listening to Lady Catherine, while the latter did not open her mouth throughout the meal.</t2611> <t2612>Miss Jenkinson's main occupation was to watch over the little that Miss de Bourgh ate, insistently asking her to take another dish, fearing all the time that she was unwell.</t2612> <t2613>Maria thought it best not to speak, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and praise.</t2613>
<t2614>When the ladies returned to the drawing room, they had nothing else to do but listen to Lady Catherine, who spoke without interruption until coffee was served, expressing her opinion on all kinds of matters in such a decided manner that it was clear she was not used to being contradicted.</t2614> <t2615>She questioned Charlotte minutely and with great familiarity about her domestic affairs, giving her a multitude of advice; she told her that everything should be very well organized in a family as small as hers, and instructed her even in the care of the cows and chickens.</t2615> <t2616>Elizabeth saw that there was nothing under the attention of this great lady that did not offer her the opportunity to dictate orders to others.</t2616> <t2617>In the intervals of her discourse to Mrs. Collins, she directed several questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, about whose family she knew nothing, and who, as she told Mrs. Collins, seemed to her a very gentle and pretty girl.</t2617> <t2618>She asked her, on various occasions, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than her, if any of them were about to be married, if they were pretty, where they had been educated, what kind of carriage her father had, and what her mother's maiden name had been.</t2618> <t2619>Elizabeth noticed the impertinence of her questions, but answered all of them with composure.</t2619> <t2620>Lady Catherine then observed:</t2620>
<t2621>––I understand that your father's property is to be inherited by Mr. Collins.</t2621> <t2622>I congratulate you ––he said, turning to Charlotte––; but I see no reason to bequeath the possessions outside the female line.</t2622> <t2623>In Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family, it was not done that way.</t2623> <t2624>Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?</t2624>
<t2625>––A little.</t2625>
<t2626>––Ah! Then we will have the pleasure of hearing you at some point.</t2626> <t2627>Our piano is excellent, probably better than...</t2627> <t2628>One day you will try it.</t2628> <t2629>And your sisters, do they play and sing as well?</t2629>
<t2630>––One of them, yes.</t2630>
<t2631>––And why not all of them?</t2631> <t2632>All of them should have learned.</t2632> <t2633>The Misses Webb all play, and their parents are not as rich as yours.</t2633> <t2634>Do you draw?</t2634>
<t2635>––No, nothing.</t2635>
<t2636>––How? None of you?</t2636>
<t2637>––None.</t2637>
<t2638>––It's very strange.</t2638> <t2639>I suppose they haven't had the opportunity.</t2639> <t2640>Their mother must have taken them to the city every spring to have good teachers.</t2640>
<t2641>––My mother wouldn't have objected, but my father hates London.</t2641>
<t2642>––And is your governess still with you?</t2642>
<t2643>––We have never had a governess.</t2643>
<t2644>––They have never had a governess!</t2644> <t2645>How is that possible?</t2645> <t2646>Five daughters educated at home without a governess!</t2646> <t2647>I've never seen anything like it.</t2647> <t2648>Their mother must have been a true slave to their education.</t2648>
<t2649>Elizabeth could hardly suppress a smile as she assured him that it had not been so.</t2649>
<t2650>––So, who educated them? Who took care of them?</t2650> <t2651>Without a governess, they must have been neglected.</t2651>
<t2652>––In comparison with some families, I'm not saying otherwise; but for those of us who wanted to learn, we never lacked the means.</t2652> <t2653>We were always encouraged to read, and we had all the teachers we needed.</t2653> <t2654>It is true that those who preferred to be idle, could be.</t2654>
<t2655>––Yes, I don't doubt it! And that is what a governess can prevent, and if I had known your mother, I would have insisted with all my might that she take one.</t2655> <t2656>I always maintain that in matters of education, nothing is achieved without solid and orderly instruction, and only a governess can provide that.</t2656> <t2657>You should see the number of families I have guided in this regard!</t2657> <t2658>I love to see girls well-placed.</t2658> <t2659>Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson were very well placed thanks to me, and just the other day I recommended another young woman whom I heard about by chance, and the family is very happy with her.</t2659> <t2660>Mrs. Collins, did I tell you that Lady Metcalfe was here yesterday to thank me?</t2660> <t2661>She assures that Miss Pope is a treasure.</t2661> <t2662>“Lady Catherine,” she said to me, “you have given me a treasure.”</t2662> <t2663>Have any of your younger sisters been presented to society yet, Miss Bennet?</t2663>
<t2664>––Yes, ma'am, all of them.</t2664>
<t2665>––All of them! How! All five at once?</t2665> <t2666>How strange!</t2666> <t2667>And you are only the second.</t2667> <t2668>The younger ones presented in society before the older ones get married!</t2668> <t2669>Your sisters must be very young...</t2669>
<t2670>––Yes; the youngest is not yet sixteen years old.</t2670> <t2671>Perhaps she is too young to have been introduced to society.</t2671> <t2672>But in reality, madam, I believe it would be very unfair for the younger sisters to be unable to enjoy society and its amenities, just because the older ones do not have the means or desire to marry soon.</t2672> <t2673>The youngest daughter has as much right to the pleasures of youth as the first.</t2673> <t2674>Delaying them for that reason, I believe, would not be the most appropriate way to foster fraternal affection and delicacy of thought.</t2674>
<t2675>––"Goodness!" ––said His Lordship––.</t2675> <t2676>For being so young, you express your opinions very decisively.</t2676> <t2677>Tell me, how old are you?</t2677>
<t2678>––With three grown-up sisters behind me ––replied Elizabeth, smiling––, Your Lordship cannot expect me to confess it.</t2678>
<t2679>Lady Catherine was astonished not to have received a direct response; and Elizabeth suspected that she was the first person who had dared to mock such majestic impertinence.</t2679>
<t2680>––You can't be more than twenty, I'm sure; so you don't need to hide your age.</t2680>
<t2681>––I haven't turned twenty-one yet.</t2681>
<t2682>When the gentlemen entered and finished having tea, the game tables were set up.</t2682> <t2683>Lady Catherine, Sir William, and the Collinses sat down to play a game of quadrille, and as Miss de Bourgh preferred to play casino, Elizabeth and Maria had the honor of helping Mrs. Jenkinson complete her table, which was supremely boring.</t2683> <t2684>Hardly a syllable was uttered that did not pertain to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears that Miss de Bourgh might be too hot or too cold, too much light or too little.</t2684> <t2685>The other table was much more lively.</t2685> <t2686>Lady Catherine almost never stopped talking, highlighting the mistakes of her fellow players or recounting some anecdote about herself.</t2686> <t2687>Collins did nothing but affirm everything Her Ladyship said, thanking her every time he won and apologizing when he thought his winnings were excessive.</t2687> <t2688>Sir William did not say much.</t2688> <t2689>He devoted himself to recalling in his memory all those anecdotes and so many illustrious names.</t2689>
<t2690>When Lady Catherine and her daughter grew tired of playing, the tables were cleared, and they offered the carriage to Mrs. Collins, who accepted it very gratefully, and immediately gave orders to bring it.</t2690> <t2691>The gathering then congregated by the fire to hear Lady Catherine predict what the weather would be like the next day.</t2691> <t2692>At that moment, they were informed that the carriage was at the door, and with many bows from Sir William and many expressions of gratitude from Mr. Collins, they took their leave.</t2692> <t2693>As soon as they left the hallway behind, Mr. Collins invited Elizabeth to express her opinion on what she had seen at Rosings, to which she agreed, only for Charlotte's sake, exaggerating it more than she felt.</t2693> <t2694>But no matter how hard she tried, her praise did not satisfy Mr. Collins, who soon found himself obliged to take on the task of praising Her Ladyship himself.</t2694>
<t2695>CHAPTER XXX</t2695>
<t2696>Sir William spent no more than a week in Hunsford, but it was enough to convince him that his daughter was very well situated and that a husband like that and a neighborhood like that were not often found.</t2696> <t2697>While he was there, Collins dedicated the morning to taking him around in his carriage to show him the countryside; but as soon as he left, the family returned to their usual occupations.</t2697> <t2698>Elizabeth was grateful that with the change in routine, she no longer had to see her cousin so frequently, as most of the time between lunch and dinner, Collins spent working in the garden, reading, writing, or looking out the window of his study, which faced the road.</t2698> <t2699>The room where the ladies usually stayed faced the back of the house.</t2699> <t2700>At first, it surprised Elizabeth that Charlotte did not prefer to be in the dining room, which was a larger and more pleasant-looking room.</t2700> <t2701>But soon she saw that her friend had excellent reasons for acting this way, as Collins would have undoubtedly spent less time in his room if they had enjoyed one as large as his.</t2701> <t2702>And Elizabeth approved of Charlotte's attitude.</t2702>
<t2703>From the living room, they couldn't see the road, so it was always Collins who informed them about the passing cars and especially about how often Miss de Bourgh crossed in her phaeton, something he never failed to report even though it happened almost every day.</t2703> <t2704>Miss de Bourgh usually stopped at the house to chat with Charlotte for a few minutes, but it was difficult to convince her to get out of the carriage.</t2704>
<t2705>Few days passed without Collins taking a walk to Rosings, and his wife often felt it her duty to do the same; Elizabeth, until she remembered that there might be other families willing to do the same, did not understand the sacrifice of so many hours.</t2705> <t2706>From time to time, he honored them with a visit, during which nothing that happened in the drawing room escaped his notice.</t2706> <t2707>Indeed, he paid attention to what they were doing, looked at their work and advised them to do it differently, found faults in the arrangement of the furniture or discovered negligence in the maid; if he accepted any refreshment, it seemed he did so only to point out that the meat portions were too large for them.</t2707>
<t2708>Elizabeth soon realized that although the peace of the county was not entrusted to that great lady, she was an active magistrate in her own parish, whose details were communicated to her by Collins. Whenever any of the villagers were about to cause trouble or felt discontented or helpless, Lady Catherine would personally go to the required place to settle the differences and reprimand them, restoring harmony or ensuring abundance.</t2708>
<t2709>The invitation to dine at Rosings was repeated a couple of times a week, and since Sir William's departure, as there was only one game table during the evening, the entertainment was always the same.</t2709> <t2710>They did not have many other commitments, because the lifestyle of the rest of the neighbors was below that of the Collinses.</t2710> <t2711>Elizabeth did not mind; she was comfortable with it, spending long periods chatting pleasantly with Charlotte; and since the weather was wonderful, despite the time of year, she amused herself by going out for walks.</t2711> <t2712>Her favorite walk, which she often took while the others visited Lady Catherine, was the avenue that bordered one side of the estate where there was a very beautiful and sheltered path that no one but her seemed to appreciate, and on which she was out of Lady Catherine's curious reach.</t2712>
<t2713>With this tranquility, the first fortnight of her stay in Hunsford quickly passed.</t2713> <t2714>Easter was approaching, and the week before it was going to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which, in such a small circle, had to be very important.</t2714> <t2715>Shortly after her arrival, Elizabeth heard that Darcy was going to arrive in a few weeks, and although she would have preferred any other of his acquaintances, the truth was that his presence could bring a bit of variety to the evenings at Rosings and that she could amuse herself by seeing the little foundation of Miss Bingley's hopes while observing Darcy's attitude towards Miss de Bourgh, to whom Lady Catherine evidently intended him.</t2715> <t2716>Her Ladyship spoke of his coming with enormous satisfaction, and of him, in terms of the highest admiration; and it seemed to bother her that Miss Lucas and Elizabeth had already seen him frequently before.</t2716>
<t2717>Their arrival was known immediately, for Collins had been strolling all morning with his eyes fixed on the pavilions at the entrance to the Hunsford road; as soon as he saw the carriage enter the estate, he made his corresponding bow, and ran home to deliver the grand news.</t2717> <t2718>The next morning he flew to Rosings to pay his respects.</t2718> <t2719>But there was someone else to whom he had to present them, for there he found two of Lady Catherine's nephews.</t2719> <t2720>Darcy had come with Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord; and to the great surprise of the whole house, when Collins returned, both gentlemen accompanied him.</t2720> <t2721>Charlotte saw them from her husband's room as they crossed the path, and rushed to the other room to inform the two girls of the great honor that awaited them, and added:</t2721>
<t2722>––Elizabeth, it is you whom I must thank for this display of courtesy.</t2722> <t2723>Mr. Darcy would not have come to visit me so soon.</t2723>
<t2724>Elizabeth barely had time to deny her right to such a compliment, for immediately the bell rang announcing the arrival of the two gentlemen, who shortly after entered the room.</t2724>
<t2725>Colonel Fitzwilliam was ahead; he was about thirty years old, not handsome, but in his manner and person, he distinguished himself as a gentleman.</t2725> <t2726>Darcy was the same as in Hertfordshire; he greeted Mrs. Collins with his usual reserve, and whatever his feelings towards Elizabeth were, he greeted her with apparent impassivity.</t2726> <t2727>Elizabeth merely bowed without saying a word.</t2727> <t2728>Colonel Fitzwilliam took part in the conversation with the ease and fluency of a well-educated man, he was very pleasant; but his cousin, after making a few brief remarks to Mrs. Collins about the garden and the house, sat for a long time without speaking to anyone.</t2728> <t2729>Finally, however, his courtesy extended to asking Elizabeth how her family was.</t2729> <t2730>She replied in the usual terms, and after a moment of silence, added:</t2730>
<t2731>––My older sister has spent these three months in London.</t2731> <t2732>Haven't you seen her by any chance?</t2732>
<t2733>He knew perfectly well that he had not seen her, but he wanted to see if any gesture would betray him and reveal that he was aware of what had happened between the Bingleys and Jane; and it seemed to him that he was a bit embarrassed when he replied that he had never had the luck to meet Miss Bennet.</t2733> <t2734>Nothing more was said about the matter, and shortly after, the gentlemen left.</t2734>
<t2735>CHAPTER XXXI</t2735>
<t2736>Colonel Fitzwilliam was highly praised and all the ladies considered that his presence would be an additional charm to the gatherings at Rosings.</t2736> <t2737>But a few days passed without receiving any invitation, as if, having guests in the house, the Collinses were no longer needed.</t2737> <t2738>Until Easter day, a week after the arrival of the two gentlemen, they were not honored with such attention and even then, upon leaving the church, they were advised not to go until the very late afternoon.</t2738>
<t2739>During the previous week, they saw very little of Lady Catherine and her daughter.</t2739> <t2740>Colonel Fitzwilliam visited the Collins' house more than once, but they only saw Darcy at church.</t2740>
<t2741>The invitation, naturally, was accepted, and at the appropriate time, the Collinses presented themselves in Lady Catherine's drawing room.</t2741> <t2742>Her Ladyship received them attentively, but it was quite clear that their company was no longer as pleasing to her as when she was alone; indeed, she was focused on her nephews and spoke with them, especially with Darcy–– much more than with any other person in the room.</t2742>
<t2743>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed genuinely pleased to see them; in Rosings, anything seemed like a relief to him, and besides, Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had captivated him.</t2743> <t2744>He sat next to Elizabeth and they chatted so pleasantly about Kent and Hertfordshire, their travels and the time spent at home, new books and music, that Elizabeth had never enjoyed herself so much in that parlor; they spoke with such ease and animation that they attracted the attention of Lady Catherine and Darcy.</t2744> <t2745>The latter had already looked at them several times with curiosity.</t2745> <t2746>Her Ladyship soon shared the same sentiment, and it was clearly seen, for she did not hesitate to ask:</t2746>
<t2747>––What are you saying, Fitzwilliam?</t2747> <t2748>What are you talking about?</t2748> <t2749>What are you telling Miss Bennet?</t2749> <t2750>Let me hear it.</t2750>
<t2751>––We are talking about music, madam ––declared the colonel when he saw that he couldn't avoid the response.</t2751>
<t2752>––About music!</t2752> <t2753>Well, do me the favor of speaking loudly.</t2753> <t2754>Of all the topics of conversation, it is the one I enjoy the most.</t2754> <t2755>I must take part in the conversation if you are talking about music.</t2755> <t2756>I believe there are few people in England more fond of music than I am or who possess better natural taste.</t2756> <t2757>If I had studied, I would have become a great disciple.</t2757> <t2758>The same would happen to Anne if her health permitted it; I am sure she would have played delightfully.</t2758> <t2759>How is Georgiana, Darcy?</t2759>
<t2760>Darcy made a cordial compliment about how advanced his sister was.</t2760>
<t2761>––I am very glad that you give me such good news ––said Lady Catherine––, and I beg you to tell her on my behalf that if she does not practice a lot, she will not improve at all.</t2761>
<t2762>––I assure you that he doesn't need to be warned.</t2762> <t2763>He practices constantly.</t2763>
<t2764>––Better.</t2764> <t2765>That is never too much; and the next time I write to her, I will make sure she does not neglect it.</t2765> <t2766>I often tell young ladies that in music, nothing is achieved without constant practice.</t2766> <t2767>I have often told Miss Bennet that she will never play truly well if she does not practice more; and although Mrs. Collins does not have a piano, Miss Bennet will be very welcome, as I have often told her, if she comes to Rosings every day to play the piano in Mrs. Jenkinson's room.</t2767> <t2768>In that part of the house, she will not bother anyone.</t2768>
<t2769>Darcy seemed a little embarrassed by his aunt's rudeness, and did not reply.</t2769>
<t2770>When they finished their coffee, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth that she had promised to play, and the young woman immediately sat down at the piano.</t2770> <t2771>The colonel placed his chair beside her.</t2771> <t2772>Lady Catherine listened to half of the song and then continued talking, as before, to her other nephew, until Darcy left her and, cautiously approaching the piano, positioned himself so that he could see the face of the beautiful performer.</t2772> <t2773>Elizabeth noticed what he was doing and at the first opportune pause turned to him with a broad smile and said:</t2773>
<t2774>––Do you intend to frighten me by coming to listen to me with such seriousness?</t2774> <t2775>I am not scared, even though your sister plays so well.</t2775> <t2776>There is a kind of stubbornness in me that never allows anyone to intimidate me.</t2776> <t2777>On the contrary, my courage grows when someone tries to intimidate me.</t2777>
<t2778>––I will not tell you that you are mistaken ––replied Darcy–– because you do not sincerely believe that I had any intention of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of knowing you well enough to know that you sometimes take pleasure in holding opinions that are not actually yours.</t2778>
<t2779>Elizabeth laughed openly at that description of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam:</t2779>
<t2780>––Your cousin aims to give you a poor impression of me by teaching you not to believe a word I say.</t2780> <t2781>It dismays me to encounter someone so eager to uncover my true nature in a place where I had hoped to pass for better than I am.</t2781> <t2782>Really, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous of you to reveal the bad things you learned about me in Hertfordshire, and allow me to say that it is also very indiscreet, for this might lead me to retaliate and bring to light things that would scandalize your relatives.</t2782>
<t2783>––I'm not––afraid ––he said, smiling.</t2783>
<t2784>––Tell me, please, what you accuse him of ––exclaimed Colonel Fitzwilliam––.</t2784> <t2785>I would like to know how he behaves among strangers.</t2785>
<t2786>––I will tell you, but prepare yourself to hear something very dreadful.</t2786> <t2787>You must know that the first time I saw him was at a ball, and at that ball, what do you think he did?</t2787> <t2788>Well, he only danced four pieces, despite the scarcity of gentlemen, and more than one lady was left sitting for lack of a partner.</t2788> <t2789>Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny it.</t2789>
<t2790>––I did not have the honor of knowing any of the ladies at the gathering, except for those who accompanied me.</t2790>
<t2791>––True, and at a ball there is never a chance to be introduced... Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what shall I play now?</t2791> <t2792>My fingers are awaiting your orders.</t2792>
<t2793>––Perhaps you would have judged me better ––added Darcy–– if I had requested an introduction.</t2793> <t2794>But I am not good at making myself known to strangers.</t2794>
<t2795>––Let's ask his cousin why he is like that ––said Elizabeth, addressing no one but Colonel Fitzwilliam––.</t2795> <t2796>Shall we ask him how it is possible that a talented and well-educated man, who has lived in high society, is not capable of attending to strangers?</t2796>
<t2797>––I can answer this question myself ––replied Fitzwilliam–– without asking Darcy.</t2797> <t2798>That's because he doesn't want to bother.</t2798>
<t2799>––I acknowledge ––said Darcy–– that I do not have the ability that others possess to converse easily with people I have never seen.</t2799> <t2800>I cannot engage in those conversations and pretend to be interested in their affairs as is customary.</t2800>
<t2801>––My fingers ––replied Elizabeth–– do not move over this instrument in the masterful way I have seen other women's fingers move; they do not have the same strength or agility, and they cannot produce the same impression.</t2801> <t2802>But I have always believed it was my fault, for not wanting to take the trouble to do exercises.</t2802> <t2803>Not because my fingers are not capable, like those of any other woman, of playing perfectly.</t2803>
<t2804>Darcy smiled and said to her:</t2804>
<t2805>––You are absolutely right.</t2805> <t2806>You have used your time much better.</t2806> <t2807>No one who has the privilege of listening to you will be able to find fault.</t2807> <t2808>None of us perform in front of strangers.</t2808>
<t2809>Lady Catherine interrupted them by asking what they were talking about.</t2809> <t2810>Elizabeth began to play again.</t2810> <t2811>Lady Catherine approached and after listening to her for a few minutes, said to Darcy:</t2811>
<t2812>––Miss Bennet would not play badly if she practiced more and had enjoyed the advantages of a good teacher from London.</t2812> <t2813>She knows what it is to play the keys, although her taste is not like Anne's.</t2813> <t2814>Anne would have been a wonderful pianist if her health had allowed her to learn.</t2814>
<t2815>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to observe his cordial assent to the praise given to his cousin, but neither then nor at any other time did she discover any sign of love; and from his attitude towards Miss de Bourgh, Elizabeth deduced something consoling in favor of Miss Bingley: that Darcy would have married her if she had belonged to his family.</t2815>
<t2816>Lady Catherine continued making observations about Elizabeth's manner of playing, mixed with numerous instructions on execution and taste.</t2816> <t2817>Elizabeth endured them with all the patience that courtesy demands, and at the gentlemen's request, she continued playing until Her Ladyship's carriage was ready and took everyone home.</t2817>
<t2818>CHAPTER XXXII</t2818>
<t2819>The next morning, Elizabeth was alone writing to Jane, while Mrs. Collins and Maria had gone shopping in town, when she was startled by the ringing of the doorbell, an unmistakable sign of a visitor.</t2819> <t2820>Although she had not heard any carriage, she thought it might be Lady Catherine, and hurried to hide the half-written letter to avoid impertinent questions.</t2820> <t2821>But to her great surprise, the door opened, and Mr. Darcy entered the room.</t2821> <t2822>Darcy alone.</t2822>
<t2823>He seemed surprised to find her alone and apologized for his intrusion, saying that he believed all the ladies were in the house.</t2823>
<t2824>They both sat down and, after the obligatory questions about Rosings, it seemed they were going to remain silent.</t2824> <t2825>Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to think of something, and Elizabeth, faced with this necessity, recalled the last time they had seen each other in Hertfordshire and felt curious to see what he would say about his hasty departure.</t2825>
<t2826>––How suddenly you left Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! ––she said––.</t2826> <t2827>It must have been a very pleasant surprise for Mr. Bingley to see you so soon by his side, because, if I remember correctly, he had left a day earlier.</t2827> <t2828>I suppose both he and his sisters were well when you left London.</t2828>
<t2829>––Perfectly.</t2829> <t2830>Thank you.</t2830>
<t2831>Elizabeth warned that she was not going to answer him anymore and, after a brief silence, added:</t2831>
<t2832>––I understand that Mr. Bingley does not intend to return to Netherfield.</t2832>
<t2833>––I have never heard him say such a thing; but it is likely that he will not spend much time there in the future.</t2833> <t2834>He has many friends and is at a stage in life where friends and commitments continuously increase.</t2834>
<t2835>––If you intend to stay for a short time at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighborhood if you left it completely, and thus possibly another family could settle there.</t2835> <t2836>But perhaps Mr. Bingley has taken the house not so much for the convenience of the neighborhood as for his own, and it is to be hoped that he will keep it or leave it based on that same principle.</t2836>
<t2837>––It wouldn't surprise me ––added Darcy–– if he got rid of it as soon as he was offered an acceptable purchase.</t2837>
<t2838>Elizabeth did not answer.</t2838> <t2839>She feared speaking too much about her friend, and since she had nothing else to say, she decided to let Darcy find another topic of conversation.</t2839>
<t2840>He understood it and said immediately:</t2840>
<t2841>––This house seems very comfortable.</t2841> <t2842>I believe Lady Catherine improved it a lot when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.</t2842>
<t2843>––It seems so, and I am sure that he could not have given a better proof of his kindness.</t2843>
<t2844>––Mr. Collins seems to have been very fortunate in the choice of his wife.</t2844>
<t2845>––That's right.</t2845> <t2846>His friends can rejoice that he found one of the few intelligent women who would have accepted him or who would have made him happy after accepting him.</t2846> <t2847>My friend is very sensible, although her marriage to Collins seems to me the least sensible of her actions.</t2847> <t2848>However, she seems completely happy: from a prudent point of view, this was a good match for her.</t2848>
<t2849>––It must be very pleasant for Mrs. Collins to live so close to her family and friends.</t2849>
<t2850>––Do you call that a short distance?</t2850> <t2851>It's about fifty miles.</t2851>
<t2852>––And what are fifty miles of good road?</t2852> <t2853>Just over half a day's journey.</t2853> <t2854>Yes, I call that a short distance.</t2854>
<t2855>––I would never have considered that distance was one of the advantages of the match, exclaimed Elizabeth, and it would never have occurred to me that Mrs. Collins lived close to her family.</t2855>
<t2856>––That shows the attachment you have to Hertfordshire.</t2856> <t2857>Everything beyond Longbourn must already seem far away to you.</t2857>
<t2858>While speaking, he smiled in a way that Elizabeth thought she could interpret: Darcy must have assumed she was thinking about Jane and Netherfield; and she replied somewhat blushing:</t2858>
<t2859>––I don't mean to say that a woman cannot live far from her family.</t2859> <t2860>Far and near are relative things and depend on very different circumstances.</t2860> <t2861>If one has the fortune not to worry about travel expenses, the distance is the least of it.</t2861> <t2862>But this is not the case.</t2862> <t2863>The Collinses do not live in straitened circumstances, but they are not so wealthy as to afford frequent travel; I am sure my friend would not say she lives close to her family unless she were at half this distance.</t2863>
<t2864>Darcy moved his seat a little closer to Elizabeth's and said:</t2864>
<t2865>––You have no right to be so attached to your residence.</t2865> <t2866>You will not always be in Longbourn.</t2866> <t2867>Elizabeth seemed to be surprised, and the gentleman thought he should change the conversation.</t2867> <t2868>He put his chair back where it was, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, asked coldly:</t2868>
<t2869>––Do you like Kent?</t2869>
<t2870>This was followed by a short dialogue on the subject of the countryside, concise and moderate on both sides, which soon ended, as Charlotte and her sister entered, having just returned from their walk.</t2870> <t2871>The tête-à-tête left them stunned.</t2871> <t2872>Darcy explained the misunderstanding that had led to his visit to the house; he remained seated for a few more minutes, not talking much to anyone, and then left.</t2872>
<t2873>––What does this mean? ––asked Charlotte as soon as he left––.</t2873> <t2874>Dear Elizabeth, he must be in love with you, for otherwise, he would never have come to see us with such familiarity.</t2874>
<t2875>But when Elizabeth recounted how quiet he had been, it didn't seem very likely, despite Charlotte's good wishes; and after several conjectures, they limited themselves to supposing that his visit had been due to the difficulty of finding something to do, which was very natural at that time of year.</t2875> <t2876>All the sports had ended.</t2876> <t2877>At Lady Catherine's house, there were books and a billiard table, but the gentlemen were frustrated by always being cooped up indoors, and whether it was because the Collins' residence was so close, or because the walk was pleasant, or because of the people who lived there, the two cousins felt tempted to visit them every day.</t2877> <t2878>They would show up at different times in the morning, sometimes separately and other times together, and occasionally accompanied by their aunt.</t2878> <t2879>It was evident that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he felt comfortable with them, which naturally made him even more pleasant.</t2879> <t2880>The pleasure Elizabeth derived from his company and Fitzwilliam's evident admiration for her made her remember her first favorite, George Wickham.</t2880> <t2881>Comparing them, Elizabeth found that the Colonel's manners were less attractive and sweet than Wickham's, but Fitzwilliam seemed to her to be a more cultured man.</t2881>
<t2882>But understanding why Darcy came to the house so often was more difficult.</t2882> <t2883>It couldn't be to seek company, as he would sit for ten minutes without opening his mouth, and when he spoke, it seemed more out of obligation than pleasure, as if it were a sacrifice rather than a delight.</t2883> <t2884>He was rarely truly animated.</t2884> <t2885>Mrs. Collins didn't know what to think of him.</t2885> <t2886>Since Colonel Fitzwilliam sometimes laughed at Darcy's foolishness, Charlotte understood that he must not always be like that, something her limited acquaintance with the gentleman would not have allowed her to guess; and as she wished to believe that this change was the work of love and that the object of that love was Elizabeth, she set out to discover it.</t2886> <t2887>When they were at Rosings and whenever Darcy came to her house, Charlotte observed him attentively, but she couldn't make anything of it.</t2887> <t2888>It was true that he looked at her friend a lot, but the expression of those looks was ambiguous.</t2888> <t2889>It was a fixed and deep gaze, but Charlotte sometimes doubted that it was enthusiastic, and at times it simply seemed that he was distracted.</t2889>
<t2890>Two or three times he told Elizabeth that he might be in love with her, but Elizabeth would laugh, and Mrs. Collins thought it more prudent not to insist on it to avoid the danger of fostering impossible hopes, for she had no doubt that all of Elizabeth's aversion to Darcy would dissipate with the belief that he loved her.</t2890>
<t2891>In the good and affectionate plans that Charlotte made regarding Elizabeth, sometimes marrying her to Colonel Fitzwilliam was included.</t2891> <t2892>He was, without comparison, the most pleasant of all.</t2892> <t2893>He felt genuine admiration for Elizabeth and his position was excellent.</t2893> <t2894>But Darcy had considerable patronage in the Church, and his cousin had none.</t2894>
<t2895>CHAPTER XXXIII</t2895>
<t2896>During her walks through the grove within the estate, Elizabeth had more than once unexpectedly encountered Darcy.</t2896> <t2897>The first time, she was not at all pleased that bad luck had brought him precisely to a place where no one else usually went, and to prevent it from happening again, she was careful to indicate that it was her favorite spot.</t2897> <t2898>Consequently, it was rare for the encounter to happen again, and yet, it occurred even a third time.</t2898> <t2899>It seemed as if he did it with intentional malice or as a penance, because it wasn't just limited to the usual questions or a simple and annoying stop; Darcy would turn back and walk with her.</t2899> <t2900>He never talked much nor bothered her by making her talk or listen too much.</t2900> <t2901>But at the third encounter, Elizabeth was astonished by the oddity of the questions he asked: if she liked being in Hunsford, if she enjoyed solitary walks, and what her opinion was of the happiness of the Collins' marriage; but the strangest thing was that when talking about Rosings and her limited knowledge of the house, it seemed that he assumed that, upon returning to Kent, Elizabeth would also reside there.</t2901> <t2902>Was he thinking about Colonel Fitzwilliam?</t2902> <t2903>The young woman thought that if he meant anything, it had to be an allusion in that direction.</t2903> <t2904>This unsettled her a bit, and she was glad to find herself at the gate of the fence that was right in front of the Collins' house.</t2904>
<t2905>One day, while walking, she was rereading Jane's last letter and focusing on a passage that denoted the sadness with which it had been written, when, instead of running into Darcy again, she looked up and found herself face to face with Colonel Fitzwilliam.</t2905> <t2906>She quickly hid the letter and, feigning a smile, said:</t2906>
<t2907>––I never knew until now that you walked this path.</t2907>
<t2908>––I have been making the full round of the estate ––replied the colonel––, something I usually do every year.</t2908> <t2909>And I was thinking of finishing it with a visit to the parish priest's house.</t2909> <t2910>Are you going to continue walking?</t2910>
<t2911>––No; I was going to return.</t2911>
<t2912>Indeed, he turned around and together they headed towards the parish house.</t2912>
<t2913>––Are you definitely leaving Kent on Saturday? ––asked Elizabeth.</t2913>
<t2914>––Yes, if Darcy doesn't postpone the trip again.</t2914> <t2915>I am at his disposal; he arranges things as he sees fit.</t2915>
<t2916>––And if he does not like things, at least he takes great pleasure in being able to arrange them as he pleases.</t2916> <t2917>I do not know anyone who seems to enjoy the power to do what he wants more than Mr. Darcy.</t2917>
<t2918>––He likes to have his own way, replied Colonel Fitzwilliam––.</t2918> <t2919>But we all like that.</t2919> <t2920>It's just that he has more means to do it than many others, because he is rich and others are poor.</t2920> <t2921>I say what I feel.</t2921> <t2922>You know that younger children have to get used to dependency and give up many things.</t2922>
<t2923>––I believe that the youngest son of a count doesn't have it as bad as you say.</t2923> <t2924>Let's see, honestly, what do you know about renunciations and dependencies?</t2924> <t2925>When have you been deprived, due to lack of money, of going where you wanted or getting something you fancied?</t2925>
<t2926>––Those are insignificant matters, and perhaps I can acknowledge that I haven't suffered many deprivations of that nature.</t2926> <t2927>But in matters of greater importance, I am subject to a lack of money.</t2927> <t2928>The younger children cannot marry whenever they please.</t2928>
<t2929>––Unless they like rich women, which I think happens often.</t2929>
<t2930>––Our habit of spending makes us too dependent, and there are not many of my rank who marry without paying a little attention to money.</t2930>
<t2931>"Could this be referring to me?" thought Elizabeth, blushing.</t2931> <t2932>But recovering, she replied in a jovial tone:</t2932>
<t2933>––And tell me, what is the usual price for the younger son of an earl?</t2933> <t2934>Unless the elder brother is very ill, you wouldn't ask for more than fifty thousand pounds...</t2934>
<t2935>He responded in the same tone and the topic was exhausted.</t2935> <t2936>To prevent a silence that might make the colonel think that what was said had affected her, Elizabeth spoke shortly after:</t2936>
<t2937>––I imagine that his cousin brought him along mainly to have someone at his disposal.</t2937> <t2938>It surprises me that he doesn't get married, as that way he would have someone constantly subject to him.</t2938> <t2939>Although it may be that his sister suffices for that, for the moment, since as she is under his exclusive custody, he must be able to command her as he pleases.</t2939>
<t2940>––No ––said Colonel Fitzwilliam––, that advantage must be shared with me.</t2940> <t2941>I am entrusted, along with him, with the guardianship of his sister.</t2941>
<t2942>––Really?</t2942> <t2943>And tell me, what kind of tutelage do you provide?</t2943> <t2944>Does it keep you very busy?</t2944> <t2945>Girls of her age can sometimes be a bit difficult to manage, and if she has the same character as Mr. Darcy, she must also like to have her own way.</t2945>
<t2946>While she was speaking, Elizabeth noticed that the colonel was looking at her very seriously, and the way he immediately asked how she supposed Miss Darcy could cause them any trouble convinced Elizabeth that, to some extent, she had come close to the truth.</t2946> <t2947>The young woman answered his question directly:</t2947>
<t2948>––Don't be alarmed.</t2948> <t2949>I've never heard anything bad about her and I would almost assure you that she is one of the best creatures in the world.</t2949> <t2950>She is the favorite of certain ladies I know: Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley.</t2950> <t2951>I believe you told me that you also knew them.</t2951>
<t2952>––Something, yes.</t2952> <t2953>Her brother is a very pleasant gentleman, an intimate friend of Darcy.</t2953>
<t2954>––Oh, yes! ––said Elizabeth dryly––.</t2954> <t2955>Mr. Darcy is incredibly kind to Mr. Bingley and takes care of him in an extraordinary way.</t2955>
<t2956>––Does he take care of him?</t2956> <t2957>Yes, really, I think he takes care of him precisely in what requires the most care.</t2957> <t2958>From something he told me when we were coming here, I presume that Bingley owes him a lot.</t2958> <t2959>But I must ask you to forgive me, because I have no right to assume that Bingley was the person Darcy was referring to.</t2959> <t2960>They are just conjectures.</t2960>
<t2961>––What does it mean?</t2961>
<t2962>––It is something that Darcy would not want to be disclosed, for if it reached the ears of the lady's family, it would be very unpleasant.</t2962>
<t2963>Don't worry, I won't disclose it.</t2963>
<t2964>––Keep in mind that I lack evidence to suppose that it is Bingley.</t2964> <t2965>What Darcy told me is that he was glad to have recently saved a friend from a very imprudent marriage; but he did not mention names or details, and I suspected that the friend was Bingley only because he seems to me a young man very suitable for such a case, and because I know they were together all summer.</t2965>
<t2966>––Did Mr. Darcy tell you the reasons he had for interfering in the matter?</t2966>
<t2967>––I understood that there were some significant objections against the young lady.</t2967>
<t2968>––And what tricks did he use to separate them?</t2968>
<t2969>––He didn't speak of his tricks ––said Fitzwilliam, smiling––.</t2969> <t2970>He only told me what I just told you.</t2970>
<t2971>Elizabeth made no comment and continued walking with her heart swollen with indignation.</t2971> <t2972>After observing her for a bit, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.</t2972>
<t2973>––I am thinking about what you have told me ––Elizabeth replied––.</t2973> <t2974>Your cousin's behavior does not seem right to me at all.</t2974> <t2975>Why did he have to be the judge?</t2975>
<t2976>––Does that mean your intervention was indiscreet? ––I don't see what right Mr. Darcy has to decide on his friend's inclination and why he should be the one to direct and determine, in his judgment, how his friend should be happy.</t2976> <t2977>But ––he continued, composing himself––, not knowing the details, it is not right to criticize him.</t2977> <t2978>One must believe that love had little to do with this case.</t2978>
<t2979>It is to be supposed ––said Fitzwilliam––, but that very sadly diminishes my cousin's triumph.</t2979>
<t2980>He said this last part in jest, but to Elizabeth, it seemed such an accurate portrayal of Darcy that she thought it useless to respond.</t2980> <t2981>She changed the subject and began talking about trivial matters until they arrived at the house.</t2981> <t2982>As soon as the colonel left, Elizabeth locked herself in her room and thought without interruption about everything she had heard.</t2982> <t2983>There was no supposing that the colonel was referring to anyone other than Jane and Bingley.</t2983> <t2984>There could not exist two men over whom Darcy exercised such unlimited influence.</t2984> <t2985>She had never doubted that Darcy had been involved in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane; but she had always attributed the plan and the main role to Miss Bingley.</t2985> <t2986>However, if her own vanity did not blind her, he was the culprit; his pride and his whim were the cause of all that Jane had suffered and continued to suffer.</t2986> <t2987>Because of him, all hope of happiness had disappeared from the kindest and most generous heart in the world, and no one could calculate all the harm he had done.</t2987>
<t2988>Colonel Fitzwilliam had said that "there were some serious objections against the young lady."</t2988> <t2989>And those objections would surely be having an uncle who was a country lawyer and another who was a merchant in London...</t2989>
<t2990>“Against Jane,” thought Elizabeth, “there was no possible objection.</t2990> <t2991>She is the embodiment of charm and kindness!</t2991> <t2992>Her intelligence is excellent; her talent, unparalleled; her manners, captivating.</t2992> <t2993>There was nothing to object to about her father either, who, despite his eccentricities, possessed qualities that even Darcy would not disdain and a respectability that perhaps Darcy would never attain.”</t2993> <t2994>When she thought of her mother, her confidence wavered a bit; but she did not admit that Darcy could have any serious objection to her, for she was sure that his pride–– valued the lack of rank in his friend's potential relatives more than their lack of sense.</t2994> <t2995>In short, one had to think that he was driven partly by the most stubborn pride and partly by his desire to keep Bingley for his sister.</t2995>
<t2996>The agitation and tears gave Elizabeth a headache that worsened in the afternoon, and adding her ailment to her desire not to see Darcy, she decided not to accompany her cousins to Rosings, where they were invited for tea.</t2996> <t2997>Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was truly unwell, did not insist, and did everything possible to prevent her husband from doing so; but Collins could not hide his fear that Lady Catherine would take offense at Elizabeth's absence.</t2997>
<t2998>CHAPTER XXXIV</t2998>
<t2999>When everyone had left, Elizabeth, as if she intended to further exasperate herself against Darcy, set about reviewing all the letters she had received from Jane since she had been in Kent.</t2999> <t3000>They contained no lamentations nor anything that indicated she remembered the past or that she suffered because of it; but overall, and almost in every line, there was a lack of the joy that used to characterize Jane's style, a joy that, as was natural in such a calm and affectionate character, had almost never been eclipsed.</t3000> <t3001>Elizabeth focused on all the phrases revealing unease, with an attention she had not given them in the first reading.</t3001> <t3002>Darcy's shameful boast about the harm he had caused made her feel her sister's suffering more keenly.</t3002> <t3003>It consoled her a little to think that in two days she would be back by Jane's side and could help her regain her spirits with the care that only affection can provide.</t3003>
<t3004>She could not think of Darcy's departure without remembering that his cousin was leaving with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he could not think of her.</t3004>
<t3005>While she was contemplating all this, she was startled by the doorbell, and she hoped it might be Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once visited them in the afternoon and might be coming to ask how she was.</t3005> <t3006>But she soon dismissed that idea and continued with her thoughts when, to her complete surprise, she saw Darcy enter the room.</t3006> <t3007>He immediately began to inquire, very hastily, about her health, attributing his visit to a desire to know that she was feeling better.</t3007> <t3008>She replied courteously but coldly.</t3008> <t3009>Elizabeth was astonished but did not say a word.</t3009> <t3010>After several minutes of silence, he approached her and, very agitated, declared:</t3010>
<t3011>––I have fought in vain.</t3011> <t3012>I can't go on any longer.</t3012> <t3013>I am incapable of containing my feelings.</t3013> <t3014>Allow me to tell you that I admire you and love you passionately.</t3014>
<t3015>Elizabeth's astonishment was inexpressible.</t3015> <t3016>She blushed, stood staring at him, indecisive and mute.</t3016> <t3017>He interpreted it as a favorable sign and continued expressing to her all that he had felt for her for a long time.</t3017> <t3018>He explained himself well, but he had to talk not only about his love, and he was no more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than on that of pride.</t3018> <t3019>Elizabeth's inferiority, the degradation it meant for him, the family obstacles that good judgment had always made him prioritize over esteem.</t3019> <t3020>He spoke of these things with an ardor that reflected how much they hurt him, but all of it was not the most suitable to support his request.</t3020>
<t3021>Despite all the deeply rooted antipathy she had for him, Elizabeth could not remain indifferent to the manifestations of affection from a man like Darcy, and although her opinion did not change in the slightest, she was initially saddened by the disappointment he was going to experience; but the language he used afterward was so insulting that all compassion turned into anger.</t3021> <t3022>However, she tried to reply calmly when he finished speaking.</t3022> <t3023>He concluded by assuring her of the firmness of his love which, despite all his efforts, he had not been able to overcome, and hoping that it would be rewarded with the acceptance of his hand.</t3023> <t3024>By his manner of speaking, Elizabeth noticed that Darcy did not doubt that her response would be favorable.</t3024> <t3025>He spoke of fears and anxiety, but his appearance revealed absolute certainty.</t3025> <t3026>This exasperated her even more, and when he finished, she replied with cheeks flushed with anger:</t3026>
<t3027>––In these cases, I believe it is customary to express some gratitude for the feelings expressed, even if they cannot be equally reciprocated.</t3027> <t3028>It is natural to feel this obligation, and if I felt gratitude, I would thank you.</t3028> <t3029>But I cannot; I have never coveted your regard, and you have granted it very much against your will.</t3029> <t3030>I regret having hurt someone, but it was unconsciously, and I hope that hurt lasts a short time.</t3030> <t3031>The same feelings that, as you say, prevented you from revealing your intentions to me for so long will easily overcome that suffering.</t3031>
<t3032>Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on Elizabeth's face, seemed to receive her words with as much resentment as surprise.</t3032> <t3033>His complexion paled with rage and all his features showed the disturbance of his mind.</t3033> <t3034>He struggled to maintain his composure and would not open his lips until he believed he had achieved it.</t3034> <t3035>This silence was terrible for Elizabeth.</t3035> <t3036>Finally, forcing his voice to appear calm, he said:</t3036>
<t3037>––And is this the only response I will have the honor of expecting?</t3037> <t3038>Perhaps I should ask why I am being rejected with such scant courtesy.</t3038> <t3039>But it doesn't matter in the slightest.</t3039>
<t3040>––I could also ask, replied Elizabeth–– why, with such an evident purpose of offending and insulting me, you tell me that you like me against your will, against your better judgment, and even against your nature.</t3040> <t3041>Isn't this an excuse for my lack of courtesy, if indeed I have committed it?</t3041> <t3042>But, moreover, I have received other provocations, you know that very well.</t3042> <t3043>Even if my feelings had not been contrary to yours, even if they had been indifferent or even favorable, do you think there would be anything that could tempt me to accept the man who has been responsible for ruining, perhaps forever, the happiness of a very dear sister?</t3043>
<t3044>Upon hearing these words, Darcy changed color; but the shock was fleeting and he continued listening without any intention of interrupting her.</t3044>
<t3045>––I have every reason in the world to have a poor opinion of you ––continued Elizabeth––.</t3045> <t3046>There is nothing that can excuse your unjust and vile conduct.</t3046> <t3047>You will not dare to deny that you were the main, if not the only, cause of the separation between Mr. Bingley and my sister, exposing one to the censure of people for being capricious and fickle, and the other to ridicule for her failed hopes, plunging both into the greatest misfortune.</t3047>
<t3048>She paused and saw, indignantly, that Darcy was listening to her with an air that indicated he was not at all moved by any kind of remorse.</t3048> <t3049>He even looked at her with a smile of petulant disbelief.</t3049>
<t3050>––Can you deny that you have done this? ––she repeated.</t3050>
<t3051>Pretending to be calm, Darcy replied:</t3051>
<t3052>––I must not deny that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from his sister, nor that I am glad of the result.</t3052> <t3053>I have been kinder to him than to myself.</t3053>
<t3054>Elizabeth disdained to appear as if she noticed that subtle reflection, but its meaning did not escape her, and she could not reconcile it.</t3054>
<t3055>––But my antipathy is not only based on this ––continued Elizabeth.</t3055> <t3056>My opinion of you was formed long before this matter took place.</t3056> <t3057>Your character was revealed by a story Mr. Wickham told me a few months ago.</t3057> <t3058>What can you say to this?</t3058> <t3059>With what fictitious act of friendship can you defend yourself now?</t3059> <t3060>With what falsehood can you justify your dominance over others in this case?</t3060>
<t3061>––You are very keenly interested in what affects that gentleman ––said Darcy in a less calm tone, his face flushed.</t3061>
<t3062>––Who, knowing the hardships he has endured, can avoid feeling interest in him?</t3062>
<t3063>––"The hardships he has endured!" exclaimed Darcy disdainfully––.</t3063> <t3064>"Yes, truly, immense hardships..."</t3064>
<t3065>––It's your fault! ––exclaimed Elizabeth energetically––.</t3065> <t3066>You reduced him to his current relative poverty.</t3066> <t3067>You denied him the future that, as you well know, was destined for him.</t3067> <t3068>In the best years of his life, you deprived him of an independence to which he not only had a right but also deserved.</t3068> <t3069>You did all this!</t3069> <t3070>And you are still capable of ridiculing and mocking his sorrows...</t3070>
<t3071>––And that is –– shouted Darcy as he paced the room like a whirlwind –– the opinion you have of me!</t3071> <t3072>This is the esteem in which you hold me!</t3072> <t3073>I thank you for explaining it to me so openly.</t3073> <t3074>My faults, according to your calculation, are truly enormous.</t3074> <t3075>But perhaps ––he added, stopping and turning towards her–– these offenses would have been overlooked if I had not wounded your pride with my honest confession of the reservations that for a long time prevented me from making a decision.</t3075> <t3076>I would have spared myself these bitter accusations if I had been more skillful and had hidden my struggle, flattering you by making you believe that I had taken this step driven by reason, by reflection, by an unconditional and pure inclination, by whatever.</t3076> <t3077>But I abhor all kinds of deceit and I am not ashamed of the feelings I have expressed, they were natural and just.</t3077> <t3078>How could you suppose that I would be pleased by the inferiority of your family and that I would congratulate myself on the prospect of having relatives whose condition is so far below mine?</t3078>
<t3079>Elizabeth's irritation grew with each passing moment; even so, she tried with all her might to speak calmly when she said:</t3079>
<t3080>––You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that what affected me was your manner of proposing; if you imagine that you would have spared me the unpleasant task of rejecting you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.</t3080>
<t3081>Elizabeth realized that she was about to be interrupted, but she said nothing and continued:</t3081>
<t3082>––You could not have offered me your hand in any way that would have tempted me to accept it.</t3082>
<t3083>Once again, his astonishment was obvious.</t3083> <t3084>He looked at her with an expression of disbelief and humiliation at the same time, and she continued speaking:</t3084>
<t3085>––From the beginning, almost from the first moment I met him, his manners convinced me of his arrogance, his vanity, and his selfish disdain for the feelings of others; they disgusted me so much that they gave rise to the disapproval that subsequent events turned into firm dislike; and it wasn't even a month since I had known him when I realized that you would be the last man on earth I could marry.</t3085>
<t3086>––You have said enough, miss.</t3086> <t3087>I perfectly understand your feelings and I can only be ashamed of my own.</t3087> <t3088>Forgive me for having made you waste so much time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.</t3088>
<t3089>Having said this, he hurriedly left the room, and Elizabeth immediately heard him open the front door and leave the house.</t3089>
<t3090>The confusion of her mind made her suffer intensely.</t3090> <t3091>She could not stand and had to sit down because her legs were giving way.</t3091> <t3092>She cried for half an hour.</t3092> <t3093>Her astonishment at recalling what had happened grew more and more.</t3093> <t3094>Having received a marriage proposal from Darcy, who had been in love with her for so many months, and so in love that he wanted to marry her despite all the objections that had led him to prevent his friend from marrying Jane, and which should have applied equally in his own case, was incredible.</t3094> <t3095>She was pleased to have inspired such a vehement affection.</t3095> <t3096>But the pride, his abominable pride, his shameless confession of what he had done to Jane, his unforgivable brazenness in admitting it without even trying to excuse himself, and the insensitivity with which he had spoken of Wickham despite not denying his cruelty towards him, soon prevailed over the compassion she had felt when thinking about his love.</t3096>
<t3097>She remained immersed in her agitated thoughts until the noise of Lady Catherine's carriage made her realize that she was not in a condition to meet Charlotte, and she ran up to her room.</t3097>
<t3098>CHAPTER XXXV</t3098>
<t3099>Elizabeth woke up the next morning with the same thoughts and reflections she had fallen asleep with.</t3099> <t3100>She couldn't recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible for her to think of anything else.</t3100> <t3101>Unable to do anything, as soon as she had breakfast, she decided to go out to get some fresh air and exercise.</t3101> <t3102>She was heading directly towards her favorite walk when she remembered that Darcy sometimes went there; she stopped and instead of entering the estate, she took another path in the opposite direction to the street where the toll gate was, which was still bordered by the Rosings' fence, and soon passed by one of the gates that gave access to the estate.</t3102>
<t3103>After walking up and down that part of the road two or three times, he felt the temptation, given how delightful the morning was, to stop at the gates and gaze at the estate.</t3103> <t3104>The five weeks he had spent in Kent had greatly transformed the countryside, and each day the early trees grew greener.</t3104> <t3105>He was about to continue his walk when he glimpsed a gentleman in the avenue bordering the estate; the gentleman was walking towards her, and Elizabeth, fearing it was Darcy, instantly retreated.</t3105> <t3106>But the person advancing was already close enough to see her; he continued walking quickly and called her name.</t3106> <t3107>She had turned, but upon hearing that voice in which she recognized Darcy, she continued towards the gate.</t3107> <t3108>The gentleman caught up with her and, showing her a letter which she instinctively took, said to her with a haughty look:</t3108>
<t3109>––I have been strolling through the promenade for a while hoping to find you.</t3109> <t3110>Will you grant me the honor of reading this letter?</t3110>
<t3111>And then, with a slight inclination, he headed back towards the plantations and soon disappeared from sight.</t3111>
<t3112>Without expecting any pleasure, but with great curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and her astonishment grew as she saw that the envelope contained two sheets completely written in very tight handwriting.</t3112> <t3113>Even the envelope was written on.</t3113> <t3114>Continuing her walk along the path, she began to read it.</t3114> <t3115>It was dated at Rosings at eight in the morning and said the following:</t3115>
<t3116>Do not be alarmed, miss, upon receiving this letter, nor believe that I am going to repeat my feelings or renew the propositions that bothered you so much last night.</t3116> <t3117>I write with no intention of distressing you nor of humiliating myself by insisting on desires that, for the happiness of both, cannot be forgotten so easily; the effort of writing and reading this letter could have been avoided if my nature did not compel me to write it and you to read it.</t3117> <t3118>Therefore, forgive me for taking the liberty of requesting your attention; although I know you will grant it reluctantly, I ask for it in fairness.</t3118>
<t3119>Yesterday you accused me of two offenses of very different nature and magnitude.</t3119> <t3120>The first was having separated Mr. Bingley from his sister, without consideration for the feelings of either; and the other, that despite certain rights and ignoring honor and humanity, I ruined Mr. Wickham's immediate prosperity and destroyed his future.</t3120> <t3121>To have abandoned ruthlessly and intentionally the companion of my youth and my father's favorite, a young man who had almost no other future than that of our rectory and who had been educated for its practice, would be a depravity that could not be compared to the separation of two young people whose affection had been the result of only a few weeks.</t3121> <t3122>But I hope you will withdraw the severe censure you so openly directed at me last night, when you have read the following account of my actions regarding these two circumstances and their motives.</t3122> <t3123>If in the explanation that I cannot help but give, I am forced to express feelings that offend you, I can only say that I regret it.</t3123> <t3124>One must submit to necessity and any apology would be absurd.</t3124>
<t3125>It wasn't long after I arrived in Hertfordshire that I noticed, like everyone else, that Mr. Bingley favored your eldest sister much more than any of the other young ladies in the locality; but until the night of the Netherfield ball, I did not see that his affection was formal.</t3125><t3126>I had seen him in love several times before.</t3126><t3127>At that ball, while I had the honor of dancing with you, I learned for the first time, through a casual remark from Sir William Lucas, that Bingley's attentions towards your sister had given rise to hopes of marriage; he spoke of it as a settled matter with only the date to be fixed.</t3127><t3128>From that moment, I carefully observed my friend's behavior and noticed that his inclination towards Miss Bennet was greater than any he had felt before.</t3128><t3129>I also studied your sister.</t3129><t3130>Her appearance and manners were as frank, cheerful, and attractive as ever, but they did not reveal any particular regard.</t3130><t3131>My observations that evening left me convinced that, despite the pleasure with which she received my friend's attentions, she did not reciprocate his feelings.</t3131><t3132>If you were not mistaken about this, then I must have been in error.</t3132><t3133>Since you know your sister better, it is more likely the latter; and if so, if driven by that error I have caused her suffering, your resentment is not unfounded.</t3133><t3134>But I do not hesitate to assert that your sister's appearance and demeanor could have given even the most astute observer the assurance that, despite her affectionate nature, her heart did not seem to have been affected.</t3134><t3135>It is true that I wished to believe in her indifference, but I assure you that my studies and conclusions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.</t3135><t3136>I did not believe her indifferent because it suited me to believe so; I believed it with absolute impartiality.</t3136><t3137>My objections to that marriage were not exactly those I acknowledged last night could only be overcome by the force of passion, as in my own case; the disparity in rank would not be as serious for my friend as it would be for me; but there were other obstacles that, despite existing in both my friend's case and mine, I would have tried to forget since they did not affect me directly.</t3137><t3138>I must say what they were, though I will do so briefly.</t3138><t3139>The position of your mother's family, though questionable, was nothing compared to the absolute impropriety so often, almost constantly, displayed by that lady, by her three younger sisters, and occasionally even by her father.</t3139><t3140>Forgive me, it pains me to offend you; but amid the concerns about the faults of your closest relatives and your displeasure at my mentioning them, take comfort in knowing that the fact that both you and your sister conduct yourselves in such a way that no similar reproaches can be made against you, elevates you even more in the esteem you deserve.</t3140><t3141>I will only say that what happened that night confirmed all my suspicions and increased the reasons that might have already prompted me to preserve my friend from what I considered an unfortunate union.</t3141><t3142>Bingley left for London the next day, as you will recall, with the intention of returning very soon.</t3142>
<t3143>Now it remains to explain my involvement in the matter.</t3143><t3144>The displeasure of his sisters had also intensified, and we soon discovered that we agreed in our assessments.</t3144><t3145>We saw that there was no time to lose if we wanted to separate Bingley from his sister, and we decided to go with him to London.</t3145><t3146>We moved there, and immediately I set about making my friend understand the dangers of his choice.</t3146><t3147>I listed and described them to him with diligence.</t3147><t3148>But, although this might have caused his determination to waver or be postponed, I do not believe it would have ultimately prevented the marriage, except for the conviction I managed to instill in him of his sister's indifference.</t3148><t3149>Until then, Bingley had believed that she reciprocated his affection with sincere, though not equal, interest.</t3149><t3150>But Bingley possesses great natural modesty and, moreover, genuinely believes that my sagacity is greater than his.</t3150><t3151>Even so, it was not easy to convince him that he had been mistaken.</t3151><t3152>Once convinced, making him decide not to return to Hertfordshire was a matter of an instant.</t3152><t3153>I see nothing in all this that is reprehensible against me.</t3153><t3154>One thing alone in all I did seems reproachable to me: having agreed to take the necessary measures to keep Bingley unaware of his sister's presence in the city.</t3154><t3155>I knew she was in London, and Miss Bingley knew it too; but my friend has not found out yet.</t3155><t3156>Perhaps if they had met, nothing would have happened; but it did not seem to me that his affection had extinguished enough for him to see her again without any danger.</t3156><t3157>Maybe this concealment is unworthy of me, but I believed it my duty to do so.</t3157><t3158>I have nothing more to say on this matter nor any further apology to offer.</t3158><t3159>If I have hurt his sister's feelings, it has been unintentionally, and although my motives may seem insufficient to her, I do not find them so condemnable.</t3159>
<t3160>Regarding the other more important accusation of having wronged Mr. Wickham, I can only counter it by explaining in detail the relationship of that gentleman with my family.</t3160> <t3161>I am unaware of what he may have specifically accused me of, but there is more than one reliable witness who can corroborate the truth of what I am about to tell you.</t3161>
<t3162>Mr. Wickham is the son of a most respectable man who was in charge of managing all the Pemberley estates for many years, and whose excellent conduct inclined my father to favor him, as was natural; my father's affection was therefore generously manifested in George Wickham, who was his godson.</t3162> <t3163>He funded his education at a school and then at Cambridge, for his father, constantly impoverished by his wife's extravagances, would not have been able to give him a gentleman's education.</t3163> <t3164>My father not only enjoyed the boy's company, who was always very charming, but also formed the highest opinion of him and believed that the Church could be his profession, so he sought to provide him with the means for it.</t3164> <t3165>I, on the other hand, began to have a very different opinion of Wickham many years ago.</t3165> <t3166>The propensity for vices and the lack of principles that he took care to hide from his best friend could not escape the observation of a boy almost his age who had the chance to catch him in moments of carelessness that Mr. Darcy did not see.</t3166> <t3167>Now I will have to sadden you again to a degree that only you can calculate, but whatever feelings Mr. Wickham may have awakened in you, this suspicion will not prevent me from unmasking him; on the contrary, it will be an additional incentive for me.</t3167>
<t3168>My excellent father died five years ago, and his affection for Mr. Wickham remained so constant until the end that in his will he recommended that I support him in the best way that his profession would allow; if he were ordained a priest, my father wished for him to be granted a benefice capable of supporting a family, at the first vacancy.</t3168> <t3169>He also bequeathed him a thousand pounds.</t3169> <t3170>Wickham's father did not survive mine by much.</t3170> <t3171>And half a year after his death, the young Wickham wrote to me informing me that he had finally resolved not to be ordained, and that, in exchange for the benefice he was not to enjoy, he hoped I would give him some more immediate pecuniary advantage.</t3171> <t3172>He added that he intended to pursue a career in law, and that I should understand that the interest on a thousand pounds could not suffice for that.</t3172> <t3173>More than believing him sincere, I wished he were; but in any case, I agreed to his proposal.</t3173> <t3174>I knew that Mr. Wickham was not suited to be a clergyman; so I arranged the matter.</t3174> <t3175>He renounced all claims to assistance regarding the clerical profession, even if he might find himself in a position to adopt it, and accepted three thousand pounds.</t3175> <t3176>Everything seemed settled between us.</t3176> <t3177>I had too poor an opinion of him to invite him to Pemberley or admit his company in the capital.</t3177> <t3178>I believe he lived mostly in London, but his law studies were nothing but a pretext, and as there was nothing to hold him, he freely indulged in idleness and dissipation.</t3178> <t3179>I knew almost nothing of him for three years, but upon the death of the holder of the rectory that had been intended for him, he sent me a letter asking me to grant it to him.</t3179> <t3180>He told me, and it was not difficult for me to believe, that he was in very poor circumstances, opined that the law career was not profitable, and was completely decided to be ordained if I granted him the rectory in question, something he did not doubt I would do, as he knew I had no one else to occupy it and on the other hand, I could not forget the wishes of my venerable father.</t3180> <t3181>I believe you cannot blame me for having refused to comply with this demand and preventing it from being repeated.</t3181> <t3182>Wickham's resentment was proportional to the calamitousness of his circumstances, and he undoubtedly spoke of me to people with the same violence with which he directly insulted me.</t3182> <t3183>After this, all relations between him and me were broken off.</t3183> <t3184>I do not know how he lived.</t3184> <t3185>But last summer I received very unpleasant news about him.</t3185>
<t3186>I have to tell you something now that I myself would like to forget and that no other circumstance than the present one could induce me to reveal to any human being.</t3186> <t3187>I have no doubt that you will keep my secret.</t3187> <t3188>My sister, who is ten years younger than I am, was left under the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.</t3188> <t3189>About a year ago, she left school and settled in London.</t3189> <t3190>Last summer, she went with her governess to Ramsgate, where Mr. Wickham also went expressly, with complete certainty, for we later learned that Mrs. Younge and he had been in contact.</t3190> <t3191>We had, unfortunately, been deceived about the character of the governess.</t3191> <t3192>With her complicity and help, Wickham set about seducing Georgiana, whose affectionate heart was strongly impressed by his attentions; she was only a child and, believing herself to be in love, consented to elope.</t3192> <t3193>She was then only fifteen years old, which serves as an excuse.</t3193> <t3194>After confessing her imprudence, I have the satisfaction of adding that I learned of that plan from her herself.</t3194> <t3195>I went to Ramsgate and surprised them a day or two before the planned elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to distress and offend her brother whom she almost loved as a father, told me everything.</t3195> <t3196>You can imagine how I felt and how I acted.</t3196> <t3197>Out of consideration for my sister's honor and feelings, I did not make a public scandal, but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left immediately.</t3197> <t3198>Mrs. Younge, naturally, was dismissed on the spot.</t3198> <t3199>Mr. Wickham's main objective was undoubtedly my sister's fortune, which amounts to thirty thousand pounds, but I cannot help but suspect that his desire for revenge against me was also part of his purpose.</t3199> <t3200>It really would have been a complete revenge.</t3200>
<t3201>This is, miss, the faithful narration of what happened between him and me; and if you do not reject it as absolutely false, I hope that henceforth you will withdraw the accusation of having behaved cruelly towards Mr. Wickham.</t3201> <t3202>I do not know in what way or with what falsehood he has deceived you; but it is not surprising that he has succeeded, for you were unaware of all these matters.</t3202> <t3203>It was impossible for you to find them out and you were not inclined to suspect them.</t3203>
<t3204>You may wonder why I did not tell you everything last night, but at that time I was not in control of myself and did not know what I could or should reveal to you.</t3204> <t3205>Regarding the truth of everything I have narrated to you, I can appeal to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, due to our close relationship and constant interaction, and even more so for being one of the executors of my father's will, has had to become fully aware of everything that has happened.</t3205> <t3206>If the hatred you feel towards me invalidates my assertions, you may consult with my cousin, against whom you will have no reason for distrust; and to make this possible, I will try to find the opportunity to get this letter into your hands this very morning.</t3206> <t3207>I only have to add: May God bless you.</t3207>
<t3208>Fitzwilliam Darcy.</t3208>
<t3209>CHAPTER XXXVI</t3209>
<t3210>Elizabeth did not expect, when Darcy gave her the letter, that he would repeat his proposal in it, but she had no idea what it might contain.</t3210> <t3211>Upon discovering it, one can well imagine how quickly she read it and what conflicting emotions it aroused in her.</t3211> <t3212>It would have been difficult to define her feelings.</t3212> <t3213>At first, she believed with astonishment that Darcy would want to apologize as best he could, but she immediately became firmly convinced that he could not offer any explanation that the most basic sense of dignity would not advise concealing.</t3213> <t3214>With great prejudice against everything he might say, she began to read his account of what had happened at Netherfield.</t3214> <t3215>Her eyes skimmed the paper with such anxiety that she barely had time to comprehend, and her impatience to know what the next sentence said prevented her from understanding the meaning of the one she was reading.</t3215> <t3216>She instantly assumed that Darcy's belief in her sister's indifference was false, and the worst objections he raised to that marriage angered her too much to be able to do him justice.</t3216> <t3217>She was pleased that he expressed no regret for what he had done; his style revealed no contrition, but arrogance.</t3217> <t3218>In his lines, she saw nothing but pride and insolence.</t3218>
<t3219>But when she came to the part concerning Wickham, she read with greater attention.</t3219> <t3220>Faced with that account of events which, if true, would destroy all her good opinion of the young man, and which bore an alarming similarity to what Wickham himself had told her, her feelings became even more distressing and harder to define; confusion, suspicion, and even horror overwhelmed her.</t3220> <t3221>She wanted to deny it all and repeatedly exclaimed: "That must be false, it can't be true! It must be the greatest of lies!"</t3221> <t3222>She finished reading the letter, and without having taken in the last one or two pages, she quickly put it away, complaining to herself that she would not look at it again, that she did not want to know anything about it.</t3222>
<t3223>In such a state of perturbation, assaulted by a thousand confused thoughts, she continued walking; but it was of no use; after half a minute she took out the letter again and, overcoming herself as best she could, began once more the mortifying reading of what referred to Wickham, mastering herself enough to examine the meaning of each phrase.</t3223> <t3224>His relationship with the Pemberley family was exactly as he had said, and the kindness of the old Mr. Darcy, although Elizabeth had not known until now how far it had gone, also coincided with what Wickham himself had indicated.</t3224> <t3225>Therefore, one account confirmed the other, but when it came to the matter of the will, it was very different.</t3225> <t3226>Everything he had said about his ecclesiastical benefice was fresh in the young woman's memory, and recalling his words, she had to acknowledge that there was double intention on one side or the other, and for a few moments she believed that her wishes were not deceiving her.</t3226> <t3227>But when she read and reread everything that had happened after Wickham had refused the rectory, in exchange for which he had received a sum as considerable as three thousand pounds, she could not help but doubt again.</t3227> <t3228>She folded the letter and weighed all the circumstances with her supposed impartiality, meditating on the probabilities of sincerity of each account, but she made no progress; from both sides she found nothing but assertions.</t3228> <t3229>She began to read again, but each line proved more clearly that the matter, which she had not believed could be explained in any way other than as an infamy to the detriment of Darcy's conduct, could be exposed in such a way that left Darcy completely free of blame.</t3229>
<t3230>The vices and prodigality that Darcy did not hesitate to attribute to Wickham outraged her excessively, all the more so because she had no evidence to refute Darcy's testimony.</t3230> <t3231>Elizabeth had never heard of Wickham before his joining the county garrison, which had been prompted by his casual encounter in London with a young man she only knew superficially.</t3231> <t3232>Of his former life, nothing was known in Hertfordshire except what he himself had told.</t3232> <t3233>As for his true character, despite Elizabeth having the opportunity to analyze it, she never felt the desire to do so; his appearance, voice, and manners instantly endowed him with all virtues.</t3233> <t3234>She tried to recall some noble trait, some special gesture of integrity or kindness that could shield him from Darcy's attacks, or at least that the predominance of good qualities would compensate for those casual errors, which was how she insisted on labeling what Darcy branded as laziness and immorality ingrained in him from the beginning.</t3234> <t3235>She imagined Wickham in front of her and remembered him with all the charm of his demeanor, but apart from the general approval he enjoyed in the locality and the consideration he had gained among his comrades for his sympathy, Elizabeth could find nothing more in his favor.</t3235> <t3236>After having reflected for a long time on this point, she resumed reading.</t3236> <t3237>But what followed about the adventure with Miss Darcy was partly confirmed by the conversation Elizabeth had had the previous morning with Colonel Fitzwilliam; and, at the end of the letter, Darcy appealed, to prove the truth of everything, to the colonel himself, whose involvement in all his cousin's affairs Elizabeth knew in advance, and whose veracity she had no reason to doubt.</t3237> <t3238>She was about to turn to him, but restrained herself at the thought of how awkward it would be to take that step; dismissing it in the end, convinced that Darcy would never have risked proposing it without being absolutely certain that his cousin would corroborate his statements.</t3238>
<t3239>She perfectly remembered everything Wickham told her when they first spoke at Mr. Philips' house; many of his expressions were still entirely in her memory.</t3239> <t3240>Now she realized the impropriety of such confidences to a stranger and was amazed that she had not noticed it before.</t3240> <t3241>She saw the lack of delicacy involved in exposing oneself in that way, and the inconsistency of his statements with his behavior.</t3241> <t3242>She remembered that he boasted of not fearing to see Darcy and that Darcy would have to leave, but that he would not move, which did not prevent him from evading the Netherfield ball the following week.</t3242> <t3243>She also remembered that until the Netherfield family had left the county, he told his story only to her, but after their departure, the said story spread from mouth to mouth, and Wickham had no scruples about ruining Darcy's reputation, despite previously assuring Elizabeth that respect for the father would always prevent him from offending the son.</t3243>
<t3244>How different everything related to Wickham seemed to her now!</t3244> <t3245>His attentions towards Miss King were now solely and exclusively the consequence of his odious fortune-hunting prospects, and the mediocrity of the young lady's fortune was no longer proof of the moderation of his ambitions, but rather his eagerness to cling to anything.</t3245> <t3246>His attitude towards Elizabeth could no longer have an acceptable motive: either he had been mistaken at first about her wealth, or he had tried to flatter his own vanity by nurturing the preference she had unwittingly shown him.</t3246> <t3247>All the efforts she made to defend him were progressively weakening.</t3247> <t3248>And to further justify Darcy, she could not help but recognize that Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago proclaimed Darcy's innocence in that matter; that no matter how proud and repellent he was, never, in the entire course of their relationship ––a relationship that had recently brought them much closer, allowing her to know his character more deeply––, had she seen him do anything ignoble or unjust, nothing for which he could be accused of being irreligious or immoral; that among his friends he was appreciated and loved, and even Wickham himself had acknowledged that he was a good brother.</t3248> <t3249>She had also heard him speak of his sister with such affection that it demonstrated he had good feelings.</t3249> <t3250>If he had been as Wickham painted him, capable of such a violation of all rights, it would have been difficult for no one to know, and the friendship between such a being and a man as amiable as Bingley would have been incomprehensible.</t3250>
<t3251>She came to be ashamed of herself.</t3251> <t3252>She could not think of Darcy or Wickham without acknowledging that she had been biased, absurd, blind, and full of prejudice.</t3252>
<t3253>“How despicably I have acted,” she thought, “I, who prided myself on my discernment!”</t3253> <t3254>“I, who have boasted of my talent, who have scorned my sister’s generous candor, and have flattered my vanity with useless or blameworthy suspicions!”</t3254> <t3255>“How humiliating all this is, but how I deserve this humiliation!”</t3255> <t3256>If I had been in love with Wickham, I would not have acted with such lamentable blindness.</t3256> <t3257>But vanity, not love, has been my folly.</t3257> <t3258>Pleased with the preference of one and offended by the disdain of the other, I have from the beginning given myself up to presumption and ignorance, avoiding reason whenever it concerned either of them.</t3258> <t3259>Until this moment, I did not know myself.”</t3259>
<t3260>From herself to Jane and from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts traveled a path that soon led her to remember that the explanation Darcy had given about their matter had seemed very insufficient to her, and she read it again.</t3260> <t3261>The effect of this second reading was very different.</t3261> <t3262>How could she not give credit to what Darcy said about one of the points, if she had been forced to give it to him on the other?</t3262> <t3263>Darcy declared that he had always suspected that Jane felt no love for Bingley, and Elizabeth remembered what Charlotte's opinion had been.</t3263> <t3264>Nor could she dispute the accuracy of his description of Jane; Elizabeth knew that her sister's feelings, though fervent, had been little expressed; and that the constant complacency in her air and manners often did not go hand in hand with great sensitivity.</t3264>
<t3265>When she reached the part of the letter where Darcy mentioned her family in terms of such humiliating yet deserved reproaches, Elizabeth felt truly ashamed.</t3265> <t3266>The justice of his accusations seemed too evident for her to deny, and the circumstances he particularly alluded to as having occurred at the Netherfield ball could not have impressed him more than they had embarrassed her.</t3266>
<t3267>The praise that Darcy bestowed upon her and her sister did not go unnoticed.</t3267> <t3268>It flattered her, but she could not console herself for the disdain it implied for the rest of the family; and upon considering that Jane's troubles had actually been caused by their own family, and reflecting on how the reputation of both would suffer due to such improper conduct, she felt a despondency she had never known before.</t3268>
<t3269>After walking for two hours along the road, turning over the diversity of her thoughts, reconsidering the events, determining possibilities, and gradually getting used to such a sudden and significant change, fatigue and the memory of how long she had been away made her return to the house.</t3269> <t3270>She entered with the intention of feigning her usual cheerfulness and resolved to suppress the thoughts that besieged her, as otherwise, she would not be able to maintain any conversation.</t3270>
<t3271>They told her that the two gentlemen from Rosings had been there during her absence; Darcy only for a brief moment, to say goodbye; but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had stayed for at least an hour, to see if she arrived and almost ready to go in search of her.</t3271> <t3272>Elizabeth was hardly affected by the colonel's departure; in fact, she was glad.</t3272> <t3273>She could only think about Darcy's letter.</t3273>
<t3274>CHAPTER XXXVII</t3274>
<t3275>Both gentlemen left Rosings the next morning.</t3275> <t3276>Collins was waiting near the entrance gates to bid them farewell, and brought home the pleasant news that they seemed to be well and in a passable mood, as was to be expected after the melancholy scene that must have taken place at Rosings.</t3276> <t3277>Collins then hurried to Rosings to console Lady Catherine and her daughter, and upon returning, he brought with great satisfaction a message from Her Ladyship, who was very sad and wished for everyone to dine with her.</t3277>
<t3278>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without remembering that, if she had wanted, she would have been introduced to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without smiling, about how indignant she would have been.</t3278> <t3279>What would she have said? What would she have done?</t3279> <t3280>It amused her to wonder about all these things.</t3280>
<t3281>The first thing that was discussed was the decline suffered in the gatherings at Rosings.</t3281>
<t3282>––I assure you that I am very sorry ––said Lady Catherine––; I believe that no one laments the loss of friends as much as I do.</t3282> <t3283>But, moreover, I love those boys so much and they love me so much!</t3283> <t3284>They were very sad when they left, as always when we part.</t3284> <t3285>The colonel remained firm until the end, but Darcy's sorrow was much more acute, more than last year, in my opinion.</t3285> <t3286>I do not doubt that his affection for Rosings is increasing.</t3286>
<t3287>Collins had a compliment and an allusion to the matter, which mother and daughter received with a kind smile.</t3287> <t3288>After the meal, Lady Catherine observed that Miss Bennet seemed to be low in spirits.</t3288> <t3289>She immediately explained it in her own way, assuming that the idea of returning so soon to her parents' house did not appeal to her, and said:</t3289>
<t3290>––If that is the case, write to your mother to ask her to let you stay a little longer.</t3290> <t3291>I'm sure Mrs. Collins will be happy to have you by her side.</t3291>
<t3292>––I greatly appreciate Your Lordship's kind invitation ––replied Elizabeth––, but I cannot accept it.</t3292> <t3293>I have to be in London next Saturday.</t3293>
<t3294>––What!</t3294> <t3295>Then you have only been here for six weeks.</t3295> <t3296>I expected you to stay for two months; I told Mrs. Collins so before you arrived.</t3296> <t3297>There is no reason for you to leave so soon.</t3297> <t3298>Mrs. Bennet will not mind if you stay another fortnight.</t3298>
<t3299>––But my father, yes; he wrote to me last week asking me to come back soon.</t3299>
<t3300>––If your mother can do without you, your father will be able to as well.</t3300> <t3301>Daughters are never as necessary to fathers as they are to mothers.</t3301> <t3302>And if you would like to stay here another month, I could take you to London, because I have to go there at the beginning of June for a week; and since Danson won't mind traveling on the coachman's seat, there will be room for one of you, and if the weather is cool, I wouldn't mind taking both of you, as neither of you is stout.</t3302>
<t3303>You are very kind, ma'am; but I believe we will have no choice but to do what we had originally planned.</t3303>
<t3304>Lady Catherine seemed to resign herself.</t3304>
<t3305>––Mrs. Collins, you will have to send a servant with them.</t3305> <t3306>You know that I always say what I feel, and I cannot bear the idea of two young ladies traveling alone in the coach.</t3306> <t3307>It is not proper.</t3307> <t3308>Find a way to have someone accompany them.</t3308> <t3309>There is nothing I dislike as much as that.</t3309> <t3310>Young ladies must always be guarded and attended to according to their position.</t3310> <t3311>When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I insisted that two male servants go with them; otherwise, it would be improper for Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy of Pemberley and Lady Anne.</t3311> <t3312>I am very careful about these things.</t3312> <t3313>Send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins.</t3313> <t3314>I am glad it occurred to me, for it would be disgraceful for you to send them alone.</t3314>
<t3315>––My uncle will send us a servant.</t3315>
<t3316>––Ah! An uncle of yours!</t3316> <t3317>So you have a servant?</t3317> <t3318>I'm glad you have someone who thinks about these things.</t3318> <t3319>Where will you change horses?</t3319> <t3320>Oh!</t3320> <t3321>In Bromley, of course.</t3321> <t3322>If you mention my name at "The Bell," they will take good care of you.</t3322>
<t3323>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask about the trip, and since not all of them were answered by her, Elizabeth had to pay attention to her; it was fortunate, for otherwise, with her head so occupied, she would have forgotten where she was.</t3323> <t3324>She had to reserve her meditations for her solitary hours; when she was alone, she indulged in them as her greatest relief; not a day passed without her going for a walk to immerse herself in the delight of her unpleasant memories.</t3324>
<t3325>She almost knew Darcy's letter by heart.</t3325> <t3326>She studied its phrases one by one, and her feelings towards its author were sometimes extremely conflicted.</t3326> <t3327>When she focused on the tone in which he addressed her, she was filled with indignation, but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and vilified him, her anger turned against herself and she pitied Darcy's disillusionment.</t3327> <t3328>His love for her stirred her gratitude, and his general demeanor, her respect; but she could not accept him and never for a moment regretted having rejected him nor felt the slightest desire to see him again.</t3328> <t3329>The way she had behaved filled her with constant shame and regret, and the unfortunate flaws of her family caused her horrible discomfort.</t3329> <t3330>There was no remedy.</t3330> <t3331>Her father merely mocked her younger sisters, but never attempted to curb their impetuous recklessness; and her mother, whose manners were so far from any decorum, was completely insensitive to the danger.</t3331> <t3332>Elizabeth had often conspired with Jane to curb Catherine and Lydia's imprudence, but as long as they had their mother's indulgence, what hope was there that they would be corrected?</t3332> <t3333>Catherine, weak and irritable in character and absolutely submissive to Lydia's direction, had always rebelled against their warnings; and Lydia, capricious and carefree, paid them no heed.</t3333> <t3334>Both were ignorant, lazy, and vain.</t3334> <t3335>As long as there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him, and as long as Meryton was so close to Longbourn, nothing could prevent them from going there all their lives.</t3335>
<t3336>The anxiety for Jane's fate was another of her predominant concerns.</t3336> <t3337>Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to the good opinion she previously had of him, made her better realize what Jane had lost.</t3337> <t3338>Bingley's affection was sincere and his conduct had been impeccable, except for his blind trust in his friend.</t3338> <t3339>How sad, then, it was to think that Jane had been deprived of such a desirable position in every sense, so full of advantages and so promising in happiness, due to the folly and lack of decorum of her own family!</t3339>
<t3340>When to all this was added the discovery of Wickham's true personality, it was easily understood that Elizabeth's jovial spirit, which had rarely felt depressed, had now declined to such an extent that it was almost impossible for her to feign even a little joy.</t3340>
<t3341>Invitations to Rosings were as frequent during the last week of their stay in Hunsford as they were at the beginning.</t3341> <t3342>The last evening was spent there, and Her Ladyship once again asked meticulous questions about the details of the trip, gave them instructions on the best way to pack the trunks, and insisted so much on the necessity of arranging the dresses in the only way she deemed proper, that when they returned to the house, Maria felt obliged to undo all her morning's work and had to repack.</t3342>
<t3343>When they left, Lady Catherine deigned to wish them a pleasant journey and invited them to return to Hunsford the following year.</t3343> <t3344>Miss de Bourgh extended her effort to the courtesy of shaking hands with both of them.</t3344>
<t3345>CHAPTER XXXVIII</t3345>
<t3346>On Saturday morning, Elizabeth and Collins met at breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity to offer her the farewell compliments he considered absolutely necessary.</t3346>
<t3347>––I am unaware, Miss Elizabeth ––he said––, whether Mrs. Collins has expressed to you how grateful she is for your kindness in coming; but I am sure she will do so before you leave this house.</t3347> <t3348>We have greatly appreciated the favor of your company.</t3348> <t3349>We know how unappealing it can be for anyone to come to our humble abode.</t3349> <t3350>Our simple way of living, our small rooms, our few servants, and our isolation must make Hunsford an extremely dreary place for a young lady like yourself.</t3350> <t3351>But I hope you believe in our gratitude for your condescension and that we have done everything within our power to prevent you from being bored.</t3351>
<t3352>Elizabeth thanked her effusively and said she was very happy.</t3352> <t3353>She had spent six very happy weeks; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte and the kind attentions she had received had left her very satisfied.</t3353> <t3354>Collins celebrated it solemnly, but with a more smiling demeanor, he replied:</t3354>
<t3355>––It gives me the greatest pleasure to know that you have spent your time pleasantly.</t3355> <t3356>Everything that could be done has indeed been done; we have had the supreme luck of being able to introduce you to the highest society, and the frequent means of varying the humble domestic scene that our relations with Rosings have facilitated, allow us to hope that your visit has been pleasant.</t3356> <t3357>Our dealings with Lady Catherine's family are truly an extraordinary advantage and a blessing that few can boast of.</t3357> <t3358>You have seen the situation we are in at Rosings, how many times we have been invited there.</t3358> <t3359>I must sincerely acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, no one who comes here can pity themselves as long as they can share our intimacy with the Bourgh family.</t3359>
<t3360>Words were insufficient to express the elevation of his feelings, and he found himself compelled to pace the room, while Elizabeth tried to combine truth with courtesy in brief phrases.</t3360>
<t3361>––So, then, you will be able to bring good news from us to Hertfordshire, dear cousin.</t3361> <t3362>At least this is my hope.</t3362> <t3363>You have been a daily witness to Lady Catherine's great attentions towards Mrs. Collins, and I trust it has not seemed to you that your friend is unhappy.</t3363> <t3364>But regarding this point, it is better that I remain silent.</t3364> <t3365>Allow me only to assure you, dear Miss Elizabeth, that I wholeheartedly wish you the same happiness in your marriage.</t3365> <t3366>My dear Charlotte and I have but one will and one way of thinking.</t3366> <t3367>There exist between us very notable similarities of character and ideas; we seem made for each other.</t3367>
<t3368>Elizabeth could truly say that it was a great joy that it was so, and with the same sincerity, she added that she firmly believed it and was glad for her domestic well-being; however, she did not regret that the description of it was interrupted by the arrival of the lady in question.</t3368> <t3369>Poor Charlotte!</t3369> <t3370>It was sad to leave her in such company!</t3370> <t3371>But she had chosen it consciously.</t3371> <t3372>It was clear that she was pained by the departure of her guests, but she did not seem to want to be pitied.</t3372> <t3373>Her home and domestic chores, her parish, her chicken coop, and all the other associated tasks had not yet lost their charm for her.</t3373>
<t3374>Finally, the stagecoach arrived; the trunks were loaded, the packages were arranged, and they were informed that everything was ready.</t3374> <t3375>The two friends said their affectionate goodbyes, and Collins accompanied Elizabeth to the carriage.</t3375> <t3376>As they crossed the garden, he asked her to convey his warm regards to the entire family and to repeat his gratitude for the kindnesses they had shown him during his stay in Longbourn last winter, and he urged her to also greet the Gardiners even though he did not know them.</t3376> <t3377>He helped her into the carriage and, after her, Maria.</t3377> <t3378>Just as he was about to close the doors, Collins, distressed, reminded them that they had forgotten to ask him to convey something to the ladies of Rosings.</t3378>
<t3379>––But ––he added–– surely they would want us to convey their humble respects along with their gratitude for your kindness towards them.</t3379>
<t3380>Elizabeth did not object; the door closed and the carriage departed.</t3380>
<t3381>––My God! ––exclaimed María after a few minutes of silence––.</t3381> <t3382>It seems like it was just yesterday when we arrived and yet, so many things have happened!</t3382>
<t3383>––Many, it's true ––replied her companion with a sigh.</t3383>
<t3384>––We have dined at Rosings nine times, and we have had tea there twice.</t3384> <t3385>How much I have to tell! Elizabeth added to herself: "And I, how many things I have to keep to myself!"</t3385>
<t3386>The journey passed without much conversation and without any incident, and four hours after leaving Hunsford, they arrived at the Gardiners' house, where they were going to spend a few days.</t3386>
<t3387>Jane looked very well, and Elizabeth hardly had a chance to examine her state of mind, as her aunt had prepared countless invitations for them.</t3387> <t3388>But Jane was going to return to Longbourn with her sister, and once there, there would be plenty of time to observe her.</t3388>
<t3389>Elizabeth barely managed to restrain herself from telling her until then about Darcy's proposals.</t3389> <t3390>What a surprise she was going to get, and how gratifying it would be for the vanity that Elizabeth still could not master!</t3390> <t3391>It was such a strong temptation that she would not have been able to resist it if it were not for the indecision she found herself in, the extent of what she had to communicate, and the fear that if she started talking, she would be forced to mention Bingley, which would only succeed in making her sister even sadder.</t3391>
<t3392>CHAPTER XXXIX</t3392>
<t3393>In the second week of May, the three girls set off together from Gracechurch Street, heading towards the town of X, in Hertfordshire.</t3393> <t3394>Upon arriving near the inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was supposed to wait for them, they immediately saw, as proof of the coachman's punctuality, Catherine and Lydia who were on the lookout in the upper floor dining room.</t3394> <t3395>They had spent almost an hour at the place happily occupied with visiting the hat shop across the street, watching the guard on duty, and preparing a cucumber salad.</t3395>
<t3396>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly showed them a table set with all the cold cuts that can normally be found in the pantry of an inn and exclaimed:</t3396>
<t3397>––Isn't it wonderful?</t3397> <t3398>Isn't it a pleasant surprise?</t3398>
<t3399>––We want to invite all of you ––added Lydia––; but you will have to lend us the money, because we just spent ours in the store out there.</t3399>
<t3400>And, showing her purchases, she added:</t3400>
<t3401>––Look at the hat I bought.</t3401> <t3402>I don't think it's very pretty, but I thought it was the same to buy it or not; I'll take it apart as soon as we get home and see if I can improve it a bit.</t3402>
<t3403>The sisters found him very ugly, but Lydia, not giving it any importance, replied:</t3403>
<t3404>––Well, there were two or three much uglier ones in the shop.</t3404> <t3405>And when I buy a satin of a prettier color, I'll fix it up and I think it won't look too bad at all.</t3405> <t3406>Besides, it hardly matters what we wear this summer, because the county garrison is leaving Meryton in fifteen days.</t3406>
<t3407>––Really? ––exclaimed Elizabeth very satisfied.</t3407>
<t3408>––They are going to camp near Brighton.</t3408> <t3409>Let's see if Dad takes us there this summer.</t3409> <t3410>It would be a great plan and would cost very little.</t3410> <t3411>Mom wants to go more than anything else.</t3411> <t3412>Imagine, otherwise, what a sad summer awaits us!</t3412>
<t3413>“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “it would be a truly splendid plan and very fitting for us.</t3413> <t3414>That’s all we would need.</t3414> <t3415>Brighton and a whole camp of soldiers, with how disrupted we already are by a mere regiment and the monthly Meryton balls.”</t3415>
<t3416>––I have some news to share with you ––said Lydia as they sat down at the table—.</t3416> <t3417>What do you think?</t3417> <t3418>It's the most sensational thing you can imagine; something very important about a certain person we all like.</t3418>
<t3419>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other and told the servant that they no longer needed him.</t3419> <t3420>Lydia laughed and said:</t3420>
<t3421>––Ah! That reveals your formality and discretion.</t3421> <t3422>Do you think the servant was going to listen?</t3422> <t3423>As if he cared!</t3423> <t3424>I would bet he often hears things much worse than what I'm going to tell you.</t3424> <t3425>But he's a very ugly fellow; I'm glad he's gone; I've never seen such a long chin.</t3425> <t3426>Well, now let's get to the news; it concerns our dear Wickham; it's too good for the servant, isn't it?</t3426> <t3427>There's no danger of Wickham marrying Mary King.</t3427> <t3428>We'll keep it to ourselves.</t3428> <t3429>Mary King has gone to Liverpool, to her aunt's house, and she won't be coming back.</t3429> <t3430>Wickham is safe!</t3430>
<t3431>––And Mary King is safe too ––added Elizabeth––, safe from an imprudent marriage for her happiness.</t3431>
<t3432>––Well, she’s quite foolish for leaving if she loves him.</t3432>
<t3433>––But I suppose there wouldn't be much love between them ––said Jane.</t3433>
<t3434>––As for him, I'm sure he doesn't; Mary never mattered to him at all.</t3434> <t3435>Who could be interested in something so disgusting and so full of freckles?</t3435>
<t3436>Elizabeth was scandalized to think that, although she was incapable of expressing such vulgarity, the sentiment was not very different from what she herself had once harbored and admitted as liberal.</t3436>
<t3437>As soon as they had eaten and the older ones had paid, they called for the carriage and, after organizing themselves a bit, all the girls, with their boxes, their work bags, their packages, and the poorly received addition of Catherine and Lydia's purchases, settled into the vehicle.</t3437>
<t3438>––How tightly packed we are! ––exclaimed Lydia––.</t3438> <t3439>I'm glad I bought the hat, if only for the pleasure of having another hatbox!</t3439> <t3440>Well, let's get comfortable and chat and laugh all the way home.</t3440> <t3441>First, let's hear what has happened to you since you left.</t3441> <t3442>Have you met any interesting men?</t3442> <t3443>Have you had any flirts?</t3443> <t3444>I had high hopes that one of you would catch a husband before coming back.</t3444> <t3445>Jane is soon going to get old.</t3445> <t3446>She is almost twenty-three years old!</t3446> <t3447>Lord, how ashamed I would be if I didn't get married before twenty-three...!</t3447> <t3448>You can't imagine how much Aunt Philips wants you to get married.</t3448> <t3449>She says Lizzy would have done better to accept Collins; but I think it would have been very boring.</t3449> <t3450>Lord, how I would love to get married before you!</t3450> <t3451>Then I would be the one to accompany you to the balls.</t3451> <t3452>How much fun we had the other day at the Forsters'!</t3452> <t3453>Catherine and I went to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised us she would give a small dance in the evening.</t3453> <t3454>Since Mrs. Forster and I are such good friends!</t3454> <t3455>So she invited the Harringtons, but since Harriet was sick, Pen had to come alone; and then, what do you think we did?</t3455> <t3456>We dressed Chamberlayne as a woman so he could pass as a lady.</t3456> <t3457>Can you imagine the laughter?</t3457> <t3458>Nobody knew, only the colonel, Mrs. Forster, Catherine, and I, apart from my aunt, because we had to borrow one of her dresses; you can't imagine how well he looked.</t3458> <t3459>When Denny, Wickham, Pratt, and two or three other gentlemen arrived, they didn't recognize him at all.</t3459> <t3460>Oh, how I laughed!</t3460> <t3461>And how Mrs. Forster laughed!</t3461> <t3462>I thought I was going to die of laughter.</t3462> <t3463>And then, that made them suspect something and they soon discovered the joke.</t3463>
<t3464>With similar stories of parties and jokes, Lydia tried, with the help of Catherine's directions, to entertain her sisters and Maria all the way until they reached Longbourn.</t3464> <t3465>Elizabeth tried to listen to her as little as possible, but the frequent allusions to Wickham did not escape her.</t3465>
<t3466>At home, they were received with all the affection.</t3466> <t3467>Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane as beautiful as ever, and Mr. Bennet, during the meal, more than once said to Elizabeth with all his heart:</t3467>
<t3468>––I'm glad you're back, Lizzy.</t3468>
<t3469>The gathering in the dining room was large, as most of the Lucases had come to pick up Maria and hear the news.</t3469> <t3470>Many things were discussed.</t3470> <t3471>Lady Lucas was questioning Maria from across the table about the well-being and the pen of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly occupied in finding out about the London fashions that her daughter Jane was explaining to her on one side, and in conveying the information to the younger Lucases on the other.</t3471> <t3472>Lydia, shouting louder than anyone, detailed what they had enjoyed that morning to all who would listen.</t3472>
<t3473>––Oh, Mary! ––he exclaimed––.</t3473> <t3474>How much I would have liked you to come with us!</t3474> <t3475>We had so much fun!</t3475> <t3476>When Catherine and I were alone, we closed all the windows to make it look like the car was empty, and we would have gone like that the whole way if Catherine hadn't gotten sick.</t3476> <t3477>When we arrived at the "George" we were so generous! We treated the three of us to the most amazing appetizer in the world, and if you had come, we would have invited you too.</t3477> <t3478>And what a blast on the way back!</t3478> <t3479>I thought we wouldn't fit in the car.</t3479> <t3480>I almost died laughing.</t3480> <t3481>And the whole way we had a great time; we talked and laughed so loudly that we could have been heard ten miles away.</t3481>
<t3482>Mary replied gravely:</t3482>
<t3483>––Far be it from me, dear sister, to disdain those pleasures.</t3483> <t3484>They are undoubtedly suitable for the majority of women.</t3484> <t3485>But I confess that they do not amuse me at all; I would have preferred a book a thousand times over.</t3485>
<t3486>But Lydia did not hear a word of her remark.</t3486> <t3487>She rarely listened to anyone for more than half a minute, and she never paid any attention to Mary.</t3487>
<t3488>In the afternoon, Lydia insisted that they all go to Meryton to see how everyone was; but Elizabeth vehemently opposed.</t3488> <t3489>She did not want it to be said that the Bennet ladies could not stay at home for half a day without running after the officers.</t3489> <t3490>She had another reason for opposing: she feared seeing Wickham again, something she wanted to avoid at all costs.</t3490> <t3491>The satisfaction she felt at the regiment's departure was beyond what could be expressed.</t3491> <t3492>In fifteen days they would no longer be there, and she hoped that this way she would be rid of Wickham forever.</t3492>
<t3493>She hadn't been home for many hours when she realized that the Brighton plan Lydia had informed them about at the inn was often discussed by her parents.</t3493> <t3494>Elizabeth understood that Mr. Bennet had no intention of giving in, but his replies were so vague and equivocal that her mother, although sometimes discouraged, did not lose hope of eventually getting her way.</t3494>
<t3495>CHAPTER XL</t3495>
<t3496>Elizabeth could no longer contain her impatience to tell Jane everything that had happened.</t3496> <t3497>Finally, she decided to omit everything related to her sister, and after preparing her for the surprise, she recounted the most important parts of her scene with Darcy the next morning.</t3497>
<t3498>The great affection that Jane felt for Elizabeth diminished her astonishment, for anything that was admiration for her seemed perfectly natural.</t3498> <t3499>Her feelings were different.</t3499> <t3500>It hurt her that Darcy had expressed himself in such a way that was so little suitable to make himself agreeable, but it pained her even more to think of the unhappiness that her sister's refusal would have caused him.</t3500>
<t3501>––It was a mistake to be so sure of success ––he said–– and of course he shouldn't have given himself away; but just imagine how much he must regret it and how bad he must feel now!</t3501>
<t3502>––It is true ––replied Elizabeth––, I truly feel sorry for him; but his pride is so great that it won't take long for him to forget me.</t3502> <t3503>Do you think it was wrong for me to reject him?</t3503>
<t3504>––Do I mind?</t3504> <t3505>Not at all.</t3505>
<t3506>––But you must not have liked that I spoke to him with such emphasis about Wickham.</t3506>
<t3507>––I don't know if you did wrong by speaking to him the way you did.</t3507>
<t3508>––Well, you will know when I have told you what happened the next day.</t3508>
<t3509>Then Elizabeth spoke to her about the letter, repeating all its contents as far as they related to George Wickham.</t3509> <t3510>It was a hard blow for poor Jane.</t3510> <t3511>She would have traveled around the world without suspecting that such perversity could exist in all of humanity as was contained in that single individual.</t3511> <t3512>Not even Darcy's justification, however pleasing it was to her, was enough to console her from such a revelation.</t3512> <t3513>She tried with all her might to maintain that there could be some mistake, attempting to defend one without incriminating the other.</t3513>
<t3514>––It will be of no use to you ––Elizabeth told him––; you will never be able to say that both are good.</t3514> <t3515>Choose as you wish; but either you stay with one or the other.</t3515> <t3516>Between the two, they do not gather more than just enough merits for one decent man.</t3516> <t3517>We have already deceived ourselves enough lately.</t3517> <t3518>For my part, I am inclined to believe everything Darcy says; you will see what you decide.</t3518>
<t3519>It took a long time before Jane could smile.</t3519> <t3520>––I don't know what has surprised me more ––she said at last––.</t3520> <t3521>That Wickham is so wicked!</t3521> <t3522>It's almost unbelievable.</t3522> <t3523>And poor Darcy! Dear Elizabeth, just think of what he must have suffered.</t3523> <t3524>What a disappointment!</t3524> <t3525>And on top of that, confessing the bad opinion you had of him!</t3525> <t3526>And having to tell such things about his sister!</t3526> <t3527>It is truly dreadful.</t3527> <t3528>Don't you think so?</t3528>
<t3529>––Oh, no!</t3529> <t3530>All my sorrow and compassion have left me upon seeing that you feel them for both.</t3530> <t3531>I know that as long as you do justice, it is enough.</t3531> <t3532>I know I can become more and more unconcerned and indifferent.</t3532> <t3533>Your abundance of lamentations saves me.</t3533> <t3534>And if you continue to pity him for a long time, my heart will become as insensitive as a rock.</t3534>
<t3535>––Poor Wickham! He seems so good, so frank!</t3535>
<t3536>––Yes, it's true; there must have been a misdirection in the education of these two young men; one took all the kindness and the other all the good appearances.</t3536>
<t3537>––I never considered that Darcy's appearances were as bad as you said.</t3537>
<t3538>––Well, you see, I thought I was very clever when I found him so unpleasant for no reason at all.</t3538> <t3539>Feeling that kind of antipathy is like a stimulus for intelligence, it's like a sign of wit.</t3539> <t3540>You can keep talking badly about someone without ever saying anything accurate; but it's impossible to always laugh at a person without hitting the mark at least once.</t3540>
<t3541>––I am sure, Elizabeth, that when you first read Darcy's letter, you did not think so.</t3541>
<t3542>––I wouldn't have been able to, it's true.</t3542> <t3543>I was so upset, or rather, so sad.</t3543> <t3544>And the worst part of all was that I had no one to confide my sorrow in.</t3544> <t3545>To have no one to talk to about what I felt, no Jane to console me and tell me that I hadn't been as fragile, as vain, and as foolish as I thought I was!</t3545> <t3546>How much I missed you!</t3546>
<t3547>––To have attacked Darcy in that way to defend Wickham, and now to think that he didn't deserve it!</t3547>
<t3548>––It's true; but she was embittered by the prejudices she had been nurturing.</t3548> <t3549>I need you to advise me on something.</t3549> <t3550>Should I or should I not disclose what I have learned about Wickham?</t3550>
<t3551>Jane meditated for a while and then said:</t3551>
<t3552>––I don't think there's any reason to put him in such a bad light.</t3552> <t3553>What do you think?</t3553>
<t3554>––That you are right.</t3554> <t3555>Darcy has not authorized me to disclose what he has revealed to me.</t3555> <t3556>On the contrary, he has made it clear that I must keep the matter of his sister as confidential as possible.</t3556> <t3557>And, on the other hand, even if I wanted to open people's eyes to his conduct in other matters, who would believe me?</t3557> <t3558>The prejudice against Darcy is so strong that half of the good people of Meryton would rather die than have to put him on a pedestal.</t3558> <t3559>I am not suited for that.</t3559> <t3560>Wickham will leave soon, and it is better that I keep quiet.</t3560> <t3561>In some time, everything will be discovered and then we can laugh at people's foolishness for not having known it earlier.</t3561> <t3562>For now, I will say nothing.</t3562>
<t3563>––It seems very good to me.</t3563> <t3564>If you spread his defects, you could ruin him forever.</t3564> <t3565>Maybe he regrets what he did and wants to make amends.</t3565> <t3566>We should not push him to despair.</t3566>
<t3567>The tumult in Elizabeth's mind was calmed by this conversation.</t3567> <t3568>She had unburdened herself of one of the two secrets that had weighed on her soul for fifteen days, and she knew that Jane would always listen willingly whenever she wanted to talk about it.</t3568> <t3569>But she still concealed something that prudence prevented her from revealing.</t3569> <t3570>She did not dare to disclose to her sister the other half of Darcy's letter, nor to tell her how sincerely she had been loved by his friend.</t3570> <t3571>It was a secret of hers that she could share with no one, and she knew that only an agreement between Jane and Bingley would justify her confession.</t3571> <t3572>«And even then ––she told herself–– I could only tell her what Bingley himself deemed appropriate to share.</t3572> <t3573>I will not have the freedom to reveal this secret until it has lost all its value.»</t3573>
<t3574>Since she was at home all day, she had the opportunity to study her sister's true state of mind.</t3574> <t3575>Jane was not happy; she still tenderly loved Bingley.</t3575> <t3576>She had never been in love before, and her affection had all the fire of a first love, but her age and character gave it a firmness that first loves usually lack.</t3576> <t3577>She could think of nothing but Bingley, and it required all her good sense and attention to her family to moderate those memories that could ruin her health and the tranquility of those around her.</t3577>
<t3578>––Well, Elizabeth ––said Mrs. Bennet one day––, tell me now what your opinion is on the sad matter of Jane.</t3578> <t3579>I am determined not to speak of it again.</t3579> <t3580>That's what I told my sister Philips the other day.</t3580> <t3581>But I can't believe that Jane hasn't seen Bingley in London.</t3581> <t3582>Really, he is heartless and I don't think there's the slightest chance of her succeeding.</t3582> <t3583>There's no talk of him returning to Netherfield this summer, and I've asked everyone who might be informed.</t3583>
<t3584>––I don't think he will return to Netherfield anymore.</t3584>
<t3585>––Very well.</t3585> <t3586>It's better this way.</t3586> <t3587>There's no need.</t3587> <t3588>Although I will always say that he has behaved terribly with my daughter, and if I were her, I wouldn't have tolerated it.</t3588> <t3589>My only consolation is that Jane will die of a broken heart and then Bingley will regret what he has done.</t3589>
<t3590>But Elizabeth, who could not console herself with those hopes, remained silent.</t3590>
<t3591>––Tell me ––continued the mother––, the Collins live very well, don't they?</t3591> <t3592>Well, well, I hope it lasts a long time for them.</t3592> <t3593>And how do they eat?</t3593> <t3594>I'm sure Charlotte is an excellent manager.</t3594> <t3595>If she is half as sharp as her mother, she will save a lot.</t3595> <t3596>I don't think they indulge much.</t3596>
<t3597>––No, not at all.</t3597>
<t3598>––Good administration depends on it.</t3598> <t3599>Yes, yes; they will be very careful not to squander their salary.</t3599> <t3600>They will never have money troubles.</t3600> <t3601>Good for them!</t3601> <t3602>And I imagine they often talk about acquiring Longbourn when your father dies, and that they already consider it theirs as soon as that happens.</t3602>
<t3603>––They never mentioned this topic in front of me.</t3603> <t3604>––Of course, it wouldn't have been appropriate; but I have no doubt that they talk about it many times among themselves.</t3604> <t3605>Well, if they are content with a possession that legally isn't theirs, that's their problem.</t3605> <t3606>It would embarrass me.</t3606>
<t3607>CHAPTER XLI</t3607>
<t3608>The first week of the return passed quickly, and they entered the second, which was the last week of the regiment's stay in Meryton.</t3608> <t3609>The young women of the locality languished; the sadness was almost general.</t3609> <t3610>Only the elder Bennet daughters were capable of eating, drinking, and sleeping as if nothing was happening.</t3610> <t3611>Catherine and Lydia often reproached them for their insensitivity.</t3611> <t3612>They were very dejected and could not understand such hardness of heart in members of their own family.</t3612>
<t3613>––My God! What is going to become of us?</t3613> <t3614>What are we going to do? ––they exclaimed desolately––.</t3614> <t3615>How can you smile like that, Elizabeth?</t3615>
<t3616>Her loving mother shared her sorrow and remembered what she herself had suffered on a similar occasion twenty-five years ago.</t3616>
<t3617>––I remember ––he said–– that I cried for two days straight when Colonel Miller's regiment left, I thought my heart was going to break.</t3617>
<t3618>––Mine will also fall to pieces ––said Lydia.</t3618>
<t3619>––If only we could go to Brighton! ––sighed Mrs. Bennet.</t3619>
<t3620>––Oh, yes!</t3620> <t3621>If only we could go to Brighton!</t3621> <t3622>But father is so unaccommodating!</t3622>
<t3623>––A few sea baths would make me feel like new.</t3623> <t3624>––And Aunt Philips says they would do me a lot of good too ––added Catherine.</t3624>
<t3625>These lamentations continually echoed in the Longbourn house.</t3625> <t3626>Elizabeth tried to keep herself isolated, but she could not avoid the shame.</t3626> <t3627>She once again recognized the justice of Darcy's observations, and she had never felt so willing to forgive him for opposing his friend's plans.</t3627>
<t3628>But Lydia's melancholy did not take long to dissipate, for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the regiment's colonel, to accompany her to Brighton.</t3628> <t3629>This invaluable friend of Lydia was very young and had recently married.</t3629> <t3630>Since both were equally cheerful and lively, they got along perfectly and within three months of meeting, they were already close friends.</t3630>
<t3631>Lydia's enthusiasm and the adoration she felt for Mrs. Forster, Mrs. Bennet's satisfaction, and Catherine's mortification were almost indescribable.</t3631> <t3632>Without the slightest concern for her sister's displeasure, Lydia ran around the house completely ecstatic, asking everyone to congratulate her, laughing and talking more energetically than ever, while poor Catherine remained in the living room lamenting her bad luck in unreasonable terms and in a foul mood.</t3632>
<t3633>––I don't see why Mrs. Forster doesn't invite me as well ––she said––, even though Lydia is her particular friend.</t3633> <t3634>I have the same right as she does to be invited, and even more so, because I am older.</t3634>
<t3635>In vain did Elizabeth try to make her see reason, and in vain did Jane try to make her resign herself.</t3635> <t3636>The happy invitation awakened in Elizabeth feelings quite different from those of Lydia and her mother; she clearly understood that there was no longer any hope that Mrs. Bennet would show any sign of common sense.</t3636> <t3637>She could not help but ask her father not to let Lydia go to Brighton, as such a step could have dire consequences.</t3637> <t3638>She pointed out to him Lydia's unsuitability, the few advantages her friendship with Mrs. Forster could bring, and the danger that, with such company, Lydia's imprudence in Brighton, where temptations would be greater, would be redoubled.</t3638> <t3639>Mr. Bennet listened attentively to his daughter and said to her:</t3639>
<t3640>––Lydia will not be at ease until she makes a fool of herself in public at one place or another, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense and sacrifice to her family as on this occasion.</t3640>
<t3641>––If you knew ––replied Elizabeth–– the great harm that the indiscreet and improper behavior of Lydia can bring upon all of us, and the harm it has already caused us, I am sure you would think very differently.</t3641>
<t3642>––"It has already caused us trouble!" ––exclaimed Mr. Bennet––.</t3642> <t3643>"Has it scared away any of your suitors? Poor Lizzy!"</t3643> <t3644>"But don't be distressed."</t3644> <t3645>"Those delicate young men who cannot endure such nonsense are not worth it."</t3645> <t3646>"Come, tell me who are the finicky suitors that Lydia's madness has driven away."</t3646>
<t3647>––You don't understand me.</t3647> <t3648>I'm not complaining about that.</t3648> <t3649>I'm not denouncing specific dangers, but general ones.</t3649> <t3650>Our prestige and our respectability in front of people will be harmed by Lydia's extreme frivolity, disdain, and recklessness.</t3650> <t3651>Forgive me, but I have to speak to you clearly.</t3651> <t3652>If you, dear father, do not take the trouble to curb her euphoria, to teach her that she should not devote her life to her current pastimes, soon it will be too late for her to amend.</t3652> <t3653>Her character will be set, and at sixteen she will be an incorrigible flirt who will not only make a fool of herself but also of her entire family; a flirt, moreover, in the worst and most insignificant degree of flirtation, with no more attraction than her youth and her average physical traits; ignorant and empty-headed, incapable of noticing the slightest bit of the general contempt that her desire to be admired will provoke.</t3653> <t3654>Catherine is in the same danger, because she will go where Lydia leads her; vain, ignorant, lazy, and absolutely uncontrollable.</t3654> <t3655>Father, can you believe that they will not be criticized and despised wherever they go, and that they will not drag the other sisters into their disgrace?</t3655>
<t3656>Mr. Bennet realized that Elizabeth was speaking from the heart.</t3656> <t3657>He took her hand affectionately and replied:</t3657>
<t3658>––Don't be troubled, my love.</t3658> <t3659>You and Jane will always be respected and loved everywhere, and you won't seem less advantaged for having two or perhaps three very foolish sisters.</t3659> <t3660>There will be no peace in Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.</t3660> <t3661>Let her go.</t3661> <t3662>Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will watch over her.</t3662> <t3663>And she is fortunately too poor to be the target of anyone's predation.</t3663> <t3664>Her flirtation will be of less importance in Brighton than here, as the officers will find more attractive women there.</t3664> <t3665>So it will serve to make her understand her own insignificance.</t3665> <t3666>In any case, she can't get much worse, and if she does, we would then have sufficient reason to lock her up for the rest of her life.</t3666>
<t3667>Elizabeth had to be content with this answer; but her opinion remained the same, and she parted from her father sorrowful and disappointed.</t3667> <t3668>But her character prevented her from increasing her troubles by dwelling on them.</t3668> <t3669>She believed she had fulfilled her duty and was not willing to consume herself thinking about inevitable evils or to increase them with her anxiety.</t3669>
<t3670>If Lydia or her mother had known what Elizabeth had been talking about with her father, their indignation would have known no bounds.</t3670> <t3671>A visit to Brighton was for Lydia the epitome of earthly happiness.</t3671> <t3672>With her enormous imagination, she saw the streets of that cheerful coastal town teeming with officers; she saw herself attracting the gazes of dozens and dozens of them whom she had yet to meet.</t3672> <t3673>She imagined herself in the middle of the camp, with its tents laid out in the beautiful uniformity of their lines, filled with cheerful and dazzling young men in their crimson uniforms; and to complete the picture, she imagined herself sitting next to one of those tents and tenderly flirting with no fewer than six officers at once.</t3673>
<t3674>If she had known that her sister intended to take away all those dreams, all those realities, what would have happened?</t3674> <t3675>Only her mother would have been able to understand it, as she almost felt the same as her.</t3675> <t3676>Lydia's trip to Brighton was the only thing that consoled her from her melancholic conviction that she would never manage to take her husband there.</t3676>
<t3677>But neither of them suspected what had happened, and their enthusiasm continued until the very day Lydia left home.</t3677>
<t3678>Elizabeth was now going to see Wickham for the last time.</t3678> <t3679>She had often been in his company since she returned from Hunsford, and her agitation had greatly subsided; her former interest in him had completely vanished.</t3679> <t3680>She had learned to discern in that kindness which initially attracted her a certain affectation that now repelled her.</t3680> <t3681>Moreover, Wickham's attitude towards her had just displeased her, as the young man showed a desire to renew his courtship, and after all that had happened, Elizabeth could not help but feel indignant.</t3681> <t3682>She firmly restrained his vain and frivolous attentions, while still feeling the offense implied by Wickham's belief that no matter how long he had neglected her and whatever the cause of his neglect, he would flatter and win her over again just by seeking her out once more.</t3682>
<t3683>On the last day of the regiment's stay in Meryton, Wickham dined at Longbourn with other officers.</t3683> <t3684>Elizabeth was so unwilling to endure him that when Wickham asked her how she had spent her time in Hunsford, she replied that Colonel Fitzwilliam and Darcy had spent three weeks in Rosings, and she wanted to know if he knew the former.</t3684>
<t3685>Wickham seemed surprised, upset, and alarmed; but he quickly recovered and with a smile replied that he used to see him often.</t3685> <t3686>He said that he was quite a gentleman and asked if she had liked him.</t3686> <t3687>Elizabeth responded enthusiastically that she had.</t3687> <t3688>But then Wickham added, with an indifferent air:</t3688>
<t3689>––How long did you say the colonel was at Rosings?</t3689>
<t3690>––About three weeks.</t3690>
<t3691>––And did you see him often?</t3691>
<t3692>Almost every day.</t3692>
<t3693>––He is very different from his cousin.</t3693>
<t3694>––Yes, indeed.</t3694> <t3695>But I think Mr. Darcy improves a lot upon acquaintance.</t3695>
<t3696>––Wow! ––exclaimed Wickham with a look that did not go unnoticed by Elizabeth––.</t3696> <t3697>In what? ––but, restraining himself, he continued in a more jovial tone––: In manners?</t3697> <t3698>Has he deigned to behave more correctly than usual?</t3698> <t3699>Because I cannot believe ––he continued in a lower and more serious voice–– that he has improved in the essential.</t3699>
<t3700>––Oh, no!</t3700> <t3701>In essence, he is still the same as always.</t3701>
<t3702>Wickham did not know whether to be pleased with her words or to distrust their meaning.</t3702> <t3703>There was something in Elizabeth's demeanor that made him listen with anxious attention and suspicion to what she said next:</t3703>
<t3704>––By saying that he benefits from the interaction, I do not mean to imply that his character or manners have improved, but rather that by getting to know him better, it is easier to understand his attitude.</t3704>
<t3705>Wickham's alarm then betrayed itself through his blush and the agitation in his gaze; he remained silent for a few moments until he managed to overcome his embarrassment and, addressing Elizabeth again, said in the kindest tone:</t3705>
<t3706>––You, who know so well my resentment against Mr. Darcy, will understand how sincerely I must rejoice that he is astute enough to at least assume an outward correction.</t3706> <t3707>With that system, his pride can be useful, if not to him; to many others, for it will keep him away from the bad behavior of which I was a victim.</t3707> <t3708>But I very much fear that the kind of prudence to which you seem to allude is employed only during his visits to his aunt, as it does not suit him to misbehave in her presence.</t3708> <t3709>I know very well that he has always cared about appearances in front of her with the desire to bring to fruition his marriage with Miss de Bourgh, in which he puts all his effort.</t3709>
<t3710>Elizabeth couldn't suppress a smile upon hearing this; but she only responded with a slight nod of her head.</t3710> <t3711>She noticed that Wickham was about to return to the old topic of his misfortunes, and she was not in the mood to allow it.</t3711> <t3712>For the rest of the evening, Wickham pretended his usual cheerfulness, but he no longer attempted to court Elizabeth.</t3712> <t3713>In the end, they parted with mutual courtesy and also probably with the mutual desire never to see each other again.</t3713>
<t3714>When the gathering ended, Lydia went to Meryton with Mrs. Forster, from where they were to depart early the next morning.</t3714> <t3715>Her farewell to the family was more noisy than pathetic.</t3715> <t3716>Catherine was the only one who cried, although out of humiliation and envy.</t3716> <t3717>Mrs. Bennet wished her daughter to have as much fun as possible, advice that the girl was willing to follow to the letter.</t3717> <t3718>And her clamor upon leaving was so loud that she didn't even hear the gentle goodbyes from her sisters.</t3718>
<t3719>CHAPTER XLII</t3719>
<t3720>If Elizabeth's opinion were derived from what she saw in her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasant idea of marital happiness and domestic well-being.</t3720> <t3721>Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and the apparent illusion and joy that both entail, had married a woman whose weak understanding and petty spirit had put an end to all affection at the very beginning of their marriage.</t3721> <t3722>Respect, esteem, and trust had vanished forever; and all of Mr. Bennet's prospects of happiness within the home had collapsed.</t3722> <t3723>But he was not one of those men who seek comfort for the effects of their own imprudence in the pleasures that often console those who have become unhappy through their follies and vices.</t3723> <t3724>He loved the countryside and books, and they constituted the source of his main joys.</t3724> <t3725>From his wife, he owed nothing more than the laughter that her ignorance and folly provided him from time to time.</t3725> <t3726>That is not the kind of happiness a man would wish to owe to his wife; but in the absence of...</t3726> <t3727>The good philosopher only takes benefit from where it exists.</t3727>
<t3728>Elizabeth, nevertheless, had never ceased to recognize the impropriety of her father's conduct as a husband.</t3728> <t3729>She had always observed it with sorrow, but she respected his talent and was grateful for his affection, so she tried to forget what she could not ignore and to put out of her mind his continuous breach of marital duties and the decorum that, by exposing his wife to the contempt of her own daughters, was so exceedingly reprehensible.</t3729> <t3730>But she had never felt as she did then the harm that a discordant marriage can cause to the children, nor had she ever so clearly realized the dangers inherent in the misdirection of talent, talent that, if well employed, although it might not have been enough to enhance his wife's intelligence, could at least have preserved the respectability of the daughters.</t3730>
<t3731>While it is true that Elizabeth was glad of Wickham's absence, it cannot be said that she rejoiced at the regiment's departure.</t3731> <t3732>Her outings were less frequent than before, and the constant complaints of her mother and sister about the boredom they had fallen into saddened the house.</t3732> <t3733>And although Catherine might have regained the common sense lost with the departure of those who caused her disturbance, her other sister, from whose behavior all calamities could be expected, was in danger of affirming her madness and brazenness, for being near a beach and a camp, her situation was doubly threatening.</t3733> <t3734>In short, she now saw what she had already realized at other times, that an eagerly awaited event could not, upon happening, bring her all the satisfaction that was to be expected.</t3734> <t3735>It was necessary, therefore, to open another period for the beginning of her happiness, to set another goal for the achievement of her desires and hopes, which by cheering her with another anticipated pleasure, would console her for the present and prepare her for another disappointment.</t3735> <t3736>Her trip to the Lakes became the object of her happiest thoughts and constituted her best refuge in the unpleasant hours that her mother's and Catherine's discontent made inevitable.</t3736> <t3737>And if she could have included Jane in the plan, everything would have been perfect.</t3737>
<t3738>––"It's a stroke of luck," he thought, "to have something to desire.</t3738> <t3739>If everything were complete, there would undoubtedly be something that would disappoint me.</t3739> <t3740>But now, carrying with me that source of longing which will be Jane's absence, I can reasonably think that all my expectations of pleasure will be fulfilled.</t3740> <t3741>A plan that in all its parts promises happiness never turns out well; and you can't avoid some mishap if you don't have a small setback."</t3741>
<t3742>Lydia, upon leaving, promised to write very often and in great detail to her mother and Catherine, but her letters were always long overdue and all were brief.</t3742> <t3743>The ones addressed to her mother said little more than that they had just returned from the reading room where they had been greeted by such and such officers, that the decoration of the room was so beautiful that it had taken her breath away, that she had a new dress or a new parasol that she would describe more extensively, but that she couldn't because Mrs. Forster was waiting for her to go to the camp together...</t3743> <t3744>From the correspondence addressed to her sister, even less could be known, for her letters to Catherine, although long, had many underlined lines that could not be made public.</t3744>
<t3745>After the two or three weeks of Lydia's absence, health and good humor began to reign in Longbourn.</t3745> <t3746>Everything looked better.</t3746> <t3747>Families who had spent the winter in the capital were returning, and the summer festivities and invitations were reemerging.</t3747> <t3748>Mrs. Bennet recovered from her complaining state, and by mid-June, Catherine was already consoled enough to enter Meryton without tears.</t3748> <t3749>This fact was so promising that Elizabeth believed that by the next Christmas, Catherine would be so reasonable that she wouldn't mention an officer even once a day, unless by some cruel and malicious order of the War Office, a new regiment was quartered in Meryton.</t3749>
<t3750>The appointed time for the excursion to the North was already approaching; only two weeks were left, when a letter was received from Mrs. Gardiner postponing the date of the trip and, at the same time, shortening its duration.</t3750> <t3751>Mr. Gardiner's business prevented him from leaving until two weeks after the beginning of July, and he had to be back in London within a month; and since this reduced the time too much to go so far and see all the things they had planned, or to see them with enough rest and comfort, there was no choice but to give up the Lakes and think of a more limited excursion, in view of which they would not go beyond Derbyshire.</t3751> <t3752>In that region, there were enough things worth seeing to fill most of the time they had available, and, moreover, Mrs. Gardiner felt a very special attraction for Derbyshire.</t3752> <t3753>The town where she had spent several years of her life might be as interesting to her as all the famous beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.</t3753>
<t3754>Elizabeth felt very disappointed; she was very excited about going to the Lakes, and she believed there would have been plenty of time for it.</t3754> <t3755>But, in any case, she should be satisfied, they would surely have a good time, and it didn't take long for her to come to terms with it.</t3755>
<t3756>For Elizabeth, the name of Derbyshire was connected to many other things.</t3756> <t3757>It made her think of Pemberley and its owner.</t3757> <t3758>"But," she said to herself, "I can enter his county with impunity and steal a few stones without him noticing."</t3758>
<t3759>The wait then felt doubly long to her.</t3759> <t3760>There were four weeks left until her uncles arrived.</t3760> <t3761>But, finally, the time passed and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner arrived in Longbourn with their four children.</t3761> <t3762>The children ––two little girls aged six and eight respectively, and two younger boys–– were to be under the special care of their cousin Jane, the favorite of all, whose sweet and calm temperament was ideal for teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.</t3762>
<t3763>The Gardiners slept at Longbourn that night and the next morning they set off with Elizabeth in search of news and amusement.</t3763> <t3764>They had assured pleasure: the three of them were excellent travel companions, which meant they had the health and character to endure inconveniences, the cheerfulness to enhance all kinds of happiness, and the affection and intelligence to overcome any setbacks.</t3764>
<t3765>We are not going to describe Derbyshire here, nor any of the notable places they passed through: Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, and all the others, are well known.</t3765> <t3766>We will only refer to a small part of Derbyshire.</t3766> <t3767>Towards the small town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's youth, where she had recently learned that some acquaintances still resided, the travelers directed their steps after having seen the main wonders of the region.</t3767> <t3768>Elizabeth learned from her aunt that Pemberley was about five miles from Lambton.</t3768> <t3769>It was not on their way, but they only had to deviate one or two miles to visit it.</t3769> <t3770>While discussing their route the previous evening, Mrs. Gardiner expressed a desire to see Pemberley again.</t3770> <t3771>Mr. Gardiner did not object and sought Elizabeth's approval.</t3771>
<t3772>––Dear ––her aunt said to her––, wouldn’t you like to see a place you’ve heard so much about and that is connected with so many of your acquaintances?</t3772> <t3773>You know that Wickham spent all his youth there.</t3773>
<t3774>Elizabeth was distressed.</t3774> <t3775>She felt that she had nothing to do at Pemberley and was forced to say that she was not interested.</t3775> <t3776>She had to confess that she was tired of large houses, after having seen so many; and that she found no pleasure in seeing exquisite carpets and satin curtains.</t3776>
<t3777>Mrs. Gardiner censured her foolishness.</t3777>
<t3778>––If it were just a richly furnished house ––he said–– I wouldn't be interested either; but the estate is a marvel.</t3778> <t3779>It contains one of the most beautiful forests in the country.</t3779>
<t3780>Elizabeth did not speak any more, but she no longer had any peace of mind.</t3780> <t3781>The possibility of encountering Darcy while visiting Pemberley instantly crossed her mind.</t3781> <t3782>It would be horrible!</t3782> <t3783>Just thinking about it made her blush, and she thought it would be better to speak clearly to her aunt than to expose herself to such a risk.</t3783> <t3784>But this decision had its drawbacks, and she resolved that she would only adopt it if her inquiries about the absence of the property owner's family were negative.</t3784>
<t3785>Consequently, upon retiring that night, she asked the maid if Pemberley was a very beautiful place, what the name of its owner was, and finally, with no small amount of concern, if the family was spending the summer there.</t3785> <t3786>The negative response to this last question was the most welcome in the world.</t3786> <t3787>With her anxiety now gone, she felt great curiosity even about the house itself, and when the plan was proposed again the next morning and she was consulted, she instantly replied, with an evident air of indifference, that she did not dislike the idea.</t3787>
<t3788>Therefore, they set out for Pemberley.</t3788>
<t3789>CHAPTER XLIII</t3789>
<t3790>Elizabeth glimpsed the woods of Pemberley with some unease, and when they finally arrived at the gate, her heart was beating strongly.</t3790>
<t3791>The estate was enormous and comprised a great variety of lands.</t3791> <t3792>They entered through one of the lowest points and strolled for a long time through a beautiful forest that extended over its wide surface.</t3792>
<t3793>Elizabeth's mind was too busy to converse; but she observed and admired all the notable spots and all the views.</t3793> <t3794>For half a mile, they climbed a slope that led them to a considerable hill where the forest broke off and from where they immediately saw Pemberley House, situated on the other side of the valley through which a somewhat steep path wound.</t3794> <t3795>It was a stone building, spacious and beautiful, well situated on a knoll that stood out in front of a chain of high, forest-covered hills, and it had in front a rather copious stream that ran increasingly powerful, completely natural and wild.</t3795> <t3796>Its banks were neither regular nor falsely adorned with gardening works.</t3796> <t3797>Elizabeth was amazed.</t3797> <t3798>She had never seen a place more favored by nature or where natural beauty was less marred by poor taste.</t3798> <t3799>Everyone was full of admiration, and Elizabeth then understood what it might mean to be the mistress of Pemberley.</t3799>
<t3800>They went down the hill, crossed a bridge, and continued to the door.</t3800> <t3801>While they examined the appearance of the house up close, Elizabeth again feared encountering the owner.</t3801> <t3802>What if the maid had been mistaken?</t3802> <t3803>After asking for permission to see the mansion, they were led into the vestibule.</t3803> <t3804>While they waited for the housekeeper, Elizabeth had time to marvel at finding herself in such a place.</t3804>
<t3805>The housekeeper was an elderly woman, of respectable appearance, much less stiff and much more courteous than Elizabeth had imagined.</t3805> <t3806>She led them to the dining room.</t3806> <t3807>It was a well-proportioned and elegantly furnished room.</t3807> <t3808>Elizabeth glanced at it briefly and went to one of the windows to take in the view.</t3808> <t3809>The hill crowned with forest they had descended, from a distance, appeared more abrupt and more beautiful.</t3809> <t3810>The entire layout of the land was good; she looked at the landscape with delight: the stream, the trees along the banks, and the curve of the valley as far as the eye could see.</t3810> <t3811>As they moved to other rooms, the landscape appeared from different angles, but magnificent views could be seen from all the windows.</t3811> <t3812>The rooms were tall and beautiful, and their furnishings were in harmony with the fortune of their owner.</t3812> <t3813>Elizabeth noted, admiring his taste, that there was nothing flashy or tacky and that there was less pomp but more elegance than at Rosings.</t3813>
<t3814>"And to think," she said to herself, "that I could have been the mistress of all this!</t3814> <t3815>These rooms could now be mine!</t3815> <t3816>Instead of visiting them as a stranger, I could enjoy them and receive my uncles here!</t3816> <t3817>But no," she replied, recovering herself, "it would not have been possible, I would have had to give up my uncles; I would not have been allowed to invite them."</t3817>
<t3818>This revived her and saved her from something akin to regret.</t3818>
<t3819>He wanted to find out from the housekeeper if his master was truly absent, but he lacked the courage.</t3819> <t3820>Finally, it was his uncle who asked the question, and Elizabeth turned frightened when Mrs. Reynolds said yes, adding:</t3820>
<t3821>––But we expect him tomorrow.</t3821> <t3822>He is going to come with many friends.</t3822>
<t3823>Elizabeth was glad that her trip had not been postponed by a day for any reason.</t3823>
<t3824>Her aunt called her to see a painting.</t3824> <t3825>Elizabeth approached and saw a portrait of Wickham above the mantelpiece among other miniatures.</t3825> <t3826>Her aunt asked her with a smile what she thought of it.</t3826> <t3827>The housekeeper came to tell them that he was a young son of the last steward of her lord, educated by him at his own expense.</t3827>
<t3828>––Now he has joined the army ––––he added–– and I think he is a lost cause.</t3828>
<t3829>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth remained very serious.</t3829>
<t3830>––And this one ––said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures–– is my master, and it is very similar.</t3830> <t3831>It was painted at the same time as the other one, about eight years ago.</t3831>
<t3832>––I have heard much about your master's distinction ––replied Mrs. Gardiner, gazing at the portrait––, he is handsome.</t3832> <t3833>Elizabeth, tell me if it is a good likeness or not.</t3833>
<t3834>Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase upon seeing that she knew her master –– "Does the young lady know Mr. Darcy?"</t3834>
<t3835>Elizabeth blushed and replied:</t3835>
<t3836>––A little.</t3836>
<t3837>––And doesn't the young lady think he is a very handsome gentleman?</t3837>
<t3838>––Yes, very handsome.</t3838>
<t3839>––I would swear he is the most handsome I have seen; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a better and larger portrait of him.</t3839> <t3840>This room was the favorite of my previous master, and these miniatures are just as they were during his lifetime.</t3840> <t3841>He liked them very much.</t3841>
<t3842>Elizabeth then explained to herself why Wickham's was among them.</t3842>
<t3843>Mrs. Reynolds then showed them a portrait of Miss Darcy, painted when she was only eight years old.</t3843>
<t3844>––And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?</t3844>
<t3845>––Oh, yes! She is the most beautiful young woman ever seen!</t3845> <t3846>And so diligent!</t3846> <t3847>She plays and sings all day long.</t3847> <t3848>In the next room, there is a new piano that was just brought to her, a gift from my master.</t3848> <t3849>She will also arrive tomorrow with him.</t3849>
<t3850>Mr. Gardiner, with kindness and skill, was drawing her out, and Mrs. Reynolds, out of pride and affection, evidently took pleasure in talking about her master and his sister.</t3850>
<t3851>––Does your master come to Pemberley very often throughout the year?</t3851>
<t3852>––Not as much as I would like, sir; but I would say he spends half of his time here; Miss Darcy is always here during the summer months.</t3852> <t3853>“Except ––thought Elizabeth–– when she goes to Ramsgate.”</t3853>
<t3854>––If your master got married, you would see him more.</t3854>
<t3855>––Yes, sir; but I don't know when it will be.</t3855> <t3856>I don't know if there will be anyone who deserves it.</t3856>
<t3857>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.</t3857> <t3858>Elizabeth couldn't help but say:</t3858>
<t3859>––If that is what you believe, it speaks highly of Mr. Darcy.</t3859>
<t3860>––I am only telling the truth and what anyone who knows him would say ––replied Mrs. Reynolds.</t3860> <t3861>Elizabeth thought that things were going too far, and listened with growing astonishment to what the housekeeper continued to say.</t3861>
<t3862>––Never in his life did he have a word of anger with me.</t3862> <t3863>And I have known him since he was four years old.</t3863> <t3864>It was a more important compliment than all the others and more opposed to what Elizabeth thought of Darcy.</t3864> <t3865>She always firmly believed that he was a man of bad character.</t3865> <t3866>With keen curiosity, she waited to keep hearing what the housekeeper was saying, when her uncle observed:</t3866>
<t3867>––There are few people about whom that can be said.</t3867> <t3868>It is a stroke of luck for you to have such a gentleman.</t3868>
<t3869>––Yes, sir; it is a stroke of luck.</t3869> <t3870>Even if you traveled around the world, you wouldn't find a better one.</t3870> <t3871>I've always noticed that those who are kind as children, remain so as adults.</t3871> <t3872>And Mr. Darcy was the sweetest and most generous child on earth.</t3872>
<t3873>Elizabeth stared intently at the old woman: "Could that be Darcy?" she thought.</t3873>
<t3874>––I believe his father was an excellent person ––added Mrs. Gardiner.</t3874>
<t3875>––Yes, ma'am; yes, he was, and his son is exactly like him, just as good with the poor.</t3875>
<t3876>Elizabeth listened, marveled, doubted, and wished to know more.</t3876> <t3877>Mrs. Reynolds could not capture her attention with anything else.</t3877> <t3878>It was useless for her to explain the subject of the paintings, the dimensions of the rooms, and the value of the furniture.</t3878> <t3879>Mr. Gardiner, very amused at what he assumed was family prejudice inspiring the old lady's lavish praises of her master, soon insisted on his questions, and as they ascended the grand staircase, Mrs. Reynolds continued extolling Darcy's many merits.</t3879>
<t3880>––He is the best lord and the best master that could exist; he is not like the reckless young men of today who think only of themselves.</t3880> <t3881>There is not a single one of his tenants and servants who does not praise him.</t3881> <t3882>Some say he is proud, but I have never noticed it.</t3882> <t3883>I suppose they find him proud because he is not boisterous like the others.</t3883>
<t3884>"What a good place this puts everything in," thought Elizabeth.</t3884>
<t3885>––Such delicate praise ––whispered her aunt as they continued touring the house–– does not align with what he did to our poor friend.</t3885>
<t3886>––Maybe we are wrong.</t3886>
<t3887>––It’s not likely; we know it from a very reliable source.</t3887> <t3888>In the wide corridor upstairs, they were shown a lovely room recently decorated with greater elegance and a lighter tone than the lower rooms, and they were told that all of it had been done to please Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to that room the last time she was at Pemberley.</t3888>
<t3889>––He is really a good brother ––said Elizabeth, turning to one of the windows.</t3889>
<t3890>Mrs. Reynolds said that Miss Darcy would be delighted when she saw that room.</t3890>
<t3891>––And it's always like that ––he added––, he goes out of his way to please his sister.</t3891> <t3892>There is nothing he wouldn't do for her.</t3892>
<t3893>There was nothing left to see but the picture gallery and two or three of the main bedrooms.</t3893> <t3894>In the first, there were several good paintings, but Elizabeth knew nothing about art, and among the objects of that nature she had already seen downstairs, she only looked at a few pastel drawings by Miss Darcy, which were of more interest and more intelligible to her.</t3894>
<t3895>In the gallery, there were also several family portraits, but it was not easy for them to attract the attention of a stranger.</t3895> <t3896>Elizabeth went through them looking for the only portrait whose features she could recognize.</t3896> <t3897>Upon reaching it, she stopped, noting its surprising accuracy.</t3897> <t3898>Darcy's face had that same smile that Elizabeth had seen when he looked at her.</t3898> <t3899>She remained in front of the painting for several minutes, in the most attentive contemplation, and even looked at it again before leaving the gallery.</t3899> <t3900>Mrs. Reynolds informed her that it had been done during Darcy's father's lifetime.</t3900>
<t3901>Elizabeth felt at that moment a much greater inclination for the original than she had felt at the height of their relationship.</t3901> <t3902>Mrs. Reynolds' praises were no small matter.</t3902> <t3903>What praise can be more valuable than that of an intelligent servant?</t3903> <t3904>How many people had their happiness placed in Darcy's hands as a brother, a proprietor, and a lord!</t3904> <t3905>How much pleasure and how much pain could he bestow!</t3905> <t3906>How much harm and how much good could he do!</t3906> <t3907>Everything said by the housekeeper exalted him.</t3907> <t3908>Standing before the canvas on which he was portrayed, it seemed to Elizabeth that his eyes were looking at her, and she thought of his esteem for her with a much deeper gratitude than she had felt before; Elizabeth recalled the strength and warmth of his words and mitigated her lack of decorum.</t3908>
<t3909>They had already seen everything that was shown to the public in the house; they went downstairs and said goodbye to the housekeeper, who entrusted them to a gardener waiting at the vestibule door.</t3909>
<t3910>When they were crossing the meadow on their way to the stream, Elizabeth turned to look at the house again.</t3910> <t3911>Her uncles stopped as well, and while Mr. Gardiner was speculating about the age of the building, its owner suddenly came out from behind the house on the path leading to the stables.</t3911>
<t3912>They were less than twenty yards away, and their appearance was so sudden that it was impossible to prevent them from being seen.</t3912> <t3913>Elizabeth and Darcy's eyes met instantly, and their faces were covered with intense blushes.</t3913> <t3914>He stopped short and for a moment remained motionless with surprise; he quickly recovered and, stepping forward towards the visitors, spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least with absolute courtesy.</t3914>
<t3915>She had turned instinctively, but as he approached, he stopped and received her compliments with embarrassment.</t3915> <t3916>If Darcy's appearance at first sight or his resemblance to the portraits they had just been viewing had been insufficient to reveal to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner that they had Darcy himself before them, the gardener's astonishment at encountering his master would have left no room for doubt.</t3916> <t3917>They waited at a certain distance while their niece spoke with him.</t3917> <t3918>Elizabeth, astonished and confused, hardly dared to raise her eyes to Darcy and did not know how to answer the questions he asked about her family.</t3918> <t3919>Surprised by the change in manners since they had last parted, each phrase he uttered increased her embarrassment, and as she thought about how improper it was to have met him there, the few moments they were together were the most uneasy of her life.</t3919> <t3920>Darcy did not seem more in control of himself than she was; his tone lacked the usual calm, and he kept asking her when she had left Longbourn and how long she had been in Derbyshire, with such disorder and haste that his agitation was clearly evident.</t3920>
<t3921>At last, it seemed that he no longer knew what to say; he remained silent for a few moments, suddenly composed himself, and said goodbye.</t3921>
<t3922>The Gardiners met with Elizabeth and praised Darcy's good appearance; but she heard nothing; absorbed in her thoughts, she followed them in silence.</t3922> <t3923>She was overwhelmed by shame and frustration.</t3923> <t3924>How had it occurred to her to go there?</t3924> <t3925>It had been the most unfortunate and foolish decision in the world!</t3925> <t3926>How strange it must seem to Darcy!</t3926> <t3927>How was a man ––so vain!–– to interpret that?</t3927> <t3928>Her visit to Pemberley would seem deliberately made to seek him out.</t3928> <t3929>Why had she gone?</t3929> <t3930>And he, why had he come a day earlier?</t3930> <t3931>If they themselves had arrived at Pemberley just ten minutes earlier, they would not have met, for it was evident that Darcy had just arrived, that at that moment he was getting off the horse or the carriage.</t3931> <t3932>Elizabeth could not stop feeling ashamed of their unfortunate encounter.</t3932> <t3933>And Darcy's behavior, so remarkably changed, what could it mean?</t3933> <t3934>It was surprising that he had spoken to her, but even more so that he did it with such finesse and asked about her family.</t3934> <t3935>She had never seen such simplicity in his manners nor had she ever heard him express himself with such gentleness.</t3935> <t3936>What a contrast to the last time he approached her at the Rosings estate to hand her the letter!</t3936> <t3937>Elizabeth did not know what to think or how to judge all this.</t3937>
<t3938>Meanwhile, they had entered a beautiful path parallel to the stream, and with each step, a more beautiful slope of the terrain or a more impressive view of the forests they were approaching appeared before them.</t3938> <t3939>But some time passed before Elizabeth realized all of this, and although she mechanically responded to her uncles' repeated questions and seemed to direct her gaze to the objects they pointed out, she did not distinguish any part of the landscape.</t3939> <t3940>Her thoughts could not be diverted from the site of Pemberley mansion, wherever it might be, where Darcy must be.</t3940> <t3941>She longed to know what was going through his mind at that moment, what he thought of her, and if he still loved her.</t3941> <t3942>It might be that his courtesy was merely because he had already forgotten her; but there was something in his voice that denoted unease.</t3942> <t3943>She could not guess whether Darcy felt pleasure or regret at seeing her; but the truth is that he seemed bewildered.</t3943>
<t3944>The observations of her companions about her lack of attention woke her up and made her realize that she needed to appear calm.</t3944>
<t3945>They penetrated the forest and, moving away from the stream for a while, climbed to one of the highest points, from which, through the clearings of the trees, one could extend the view and appreciate magnificent panoramas of the valley and the opposite hills covered with woodland, and parts of the stream could also be seen.</t3945> <t3946>Mr. Gardiner would have liked to tour the entire estate, but he feared the walk would be too long.</t3946> <t3947>With a triumphant smile, the gardener told them that the estate was ten miles long, so they decided not to take the planned tour and headed back down to a slope with trees leaning over the water at one of the narrowest points of the stream.</t3947> <t3948>They crossed it by a simple bridge in harmony with the general aspect of the landscape.</t3948> <t3949>That spot was the least adorned with artifices of all they had seen.</t3949> <t3950>The valley, turned into a glen here, left only space for the stream and a narrow path in the middle of the rustic grove that bordered it.</t3950> <t3951>Elizabeth wanted to explore its twists and turns, but as soon as they crossed the bridge and could appreciate how far they were from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not fond of walking, did not want to go any further and only thought of returning to the carriage as soon as possible.</t3951> <t3952>Her niece was forced to yield, and they began the return to the house on the opposite side of the stream and by the shortest path.</t3952> <t3953>But they walked very slowly because Mr. Gardiner was fond of fishing, although he seldom had the chance to indulge in it, and he was distracted every so often by watching for the appearance of a trout and commenting on it with the gardener.</t3953> <t3954>As they continued their slow march, they were surprised again; and this time Elizabeth's astonishment was as great as before when she saw Darcy heading towards them and at a short distance.</t3954> <t3955>Since the path was not as hidden as the one on the other side, they saw each other from afar.</t3955> <t3956>Therefore, Elizabeth was more prepared and resolved to show calmness in her appearance and words if Darcy indeed intended to approach them.</t3956> <t3957>There was a moment when she firmly believed that Darcy was going to take another path, and her conviction lasted while a bend in the path hid him, but after passing the bend, Darcy appeared before them.</t3957> <t3958>At the first glance, she noticed that he was as courteous as a moment ago, and to imitate his good manners, she began to admire the beauty of the place; but she had barely said "delightful" and "charming" when she thought that praising Pemberley might be misinterpreted.</t3958> <t3959>She changed color and said no more.</t3959>
<t3960>Mrs. Gardiner was coming a little behind, and Darcy took advantage of Elizabeth's silence to ask her to do him the honor of introducing him to her friends.</t3960> <t3961>Elizabeth was not prepared for this gesture of courtesy, and she could not help but smile at seeing that he intended to meet one of those people against whom his pride had rebelled when he declared himself to her.</t3961> <t3962>"What will his surprise be," she thought, "when he finds out who they are? He imagines they are people of high rank."</t3962>
<t3963>He made the introduction promptly and, upon mentioning the relationship, quickly glanced at Darcy to see his reaction, hoping he would hastily flee from such company.</t3963> <t3964>It was evident that Darcy was surprised, but he composed himself and instead of continuing on his way, he turned back with all of them and began conversing with Mr. Gardiner.</t3964> <t3965>Elizabeth couldn't help but feel satisfied and triumphant.</t3965> <t3966>It was comforting that Darcy knew she had relatives of whom there was no need to be ashamed.</t3966> <t3967>She listened attentively to what they were saying and took pride in her uncle's phrases and remarks that demonstrated his intelligence, good taste, and excellent manners.</t3967>
<t3968>The conversation soon turned to fishing, and Elizabeth heard Darcy inviting her uncle to go fishing there whenever he wanted while they were in the neighboring town, even offering to provide him with gear and pointing out the best spots on the river for fishing.</t3968> <t3969>Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, looked at her with an expression of disbelief.</t3969> <t3970>Elizabeth said nothing, but she was extremely pleased; Darcy's attentions must surely be directed at her.</t3970> <t3971>Her astonishment, however, was extraordinary and she couldn't stop repeating to herself: "Why is he so changed?</t3971> <t3972>It can't be because of me, it can't be for my sake that his manners have softened so much.</t3972> <t3973>My reproaches in Hunsford cannot have effected such a transformation.</t3973> <t3974>It's impossible that he still loves me."</t3974>
<t3975>After walking for a while in this manner, the two ladies in front and the two gentlemen behind, upon resuming their path after descending to the riverbank to get a better look at a curious aquatic plant, there was a change of pairs.</t3975> <t3976>This was initiated by Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the day's exertions, found Elizabeth's arm too weak to support her and therefore preferred her husband's arm.</t3976> <t3977>Darcy then positioned himself beside the niece, and they continued their walk in this way.</t3977> <t3978>After a short silence, Elizabeth spoke.</t3978> <t3979>She wanted to let him know that before going to Pemberley, she had made sure that he was not there and that their arrival was completely unexpected.</t3979>
<t3980>––Your housekeeper ––he added–– informed us that you wouldn't arrive until tomorrow; and even before leaving Bakewell, we were told that you would be delayed in returning to Derbyshire.</t3980>
<t3981>Darcy acknowledged that it was so, but some matters he had to resolve with his steward had forced him to go ahead of his companions.</t3981>
<t3982>––Tomorrow morning ––he continued–– they will all meet with me.</t3982> <t3983>Among them are your acquaintances who will wish to see you; Mr. Bingley and his sisters.</t3983>
<t3984>Elizabeth did nothing more than a slight nod of her head.</t3984> <t3985>She instantly remembered the last time Bingley's name had been mentioned between them, and judging by Darcy's expression, he must have been thinking the same thing.</t3985>
<t3986>––A person who has a special desire to meet you is also coming with his friends ––he continued after a pause––.</t3986> <t3987>Will you allow me, or is it asking too much, to introduce my sister to you while you are in Lambton?</t3987>
<t3988>Elizabeth was left speechless.</t3988> <t3989>She could not imagine how Miss Darcy could intend such a thing; but she immediately understood that this desire was her brother's doing, and without drawing any further conclusions, it seemed very flattering to her.</t3989> <t3990>It was pleasant to know that Darcy did not hold a grudge against her.</t3990>
<t3991>They continued walking in silence, both deeply absorbed in their thoughts.</t3991> <t3992>Elizabeth could not be calm, but she felt flattered and pleased.</t3992> <t3993>Darcy's intention to introduce her to his sister was an exceptional kindness.</t3993> <t3994>Soon they left the others behind, and when they reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile away from them.</t3994>
<t3995>Darcy then invited her to come into the house, but Elizabeth declared that she was not tired and they waited together on the lawn.</t3995> <t3996>In that moment they could have talked about many things, the silence was awkward.</t3996> <t3997>She wanted to speak but her mind was blank and all the topics that came to her seemed to be off-limits.</t3997> <t3998>Finally, she remembered her trip and spoke about Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.</t3998> <t3999>Time passed, her aunt walked very slowly, and Elizabeth's patience and ideas were running out before the tête-à-tête ended.</t3999> <t4000>When Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner arrived, Darcy invited them all to come into the house and have some refreshments; but they excused themselves and parted with the utmost courtesy.</t4000> <t4001>Darcy accompanied them to the carriage, and when it started moving, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly back towards the house.</t4001>
<t4002>Then the uncles began their comments; both declared that Darcy was superior to anything that could be imagined.</t4002>
<t4003>––Her education is perfect and her elegance and simplicity are admirable ––said her uncle.</t4003>
<t4004>––There is a bit of arrogance in him ––added the aunt, but only in his demeanor, and it doesn't look bad on him.</t4004> <t4005>I can say, like the housekeeper, that although he is labeled as proud, it is not noticeable at all.</t4005>
<t4006>––His attitude towards us has left me astonished.</t4006> <t4007>He has been more than courteous, he has been frankly attentive and nothing obliged him to be so.</t4007> <t4008>His friendship with Elizabeth was very superficial.</t4008>
<t4009>––Of course, he is not as handsome as Wickham ––replied the aunt––; or rather, he is not as well-built, but his features are perfect.</t4009> <t4010>How could you tell us he was so unpleasant, Lizzy?</t4010>
<t4011>Elizabeth apologized as best she could; she said that upon seeing him in Kent, she had liked him more than before and had never found him as agreeable as that morning.</t4011>
<t4012>––He might be a bit whimsical in his courtesy ––replied the uncle––; those very haughty gentlemen tend to be like that.</t4012> <t4013>That's why I won't take his word regarding the fishing, in case he changes his mind another day and throws me off the estate.</t4013>
<t4014>Elizabeth realized that they were completely wrong about her character, but she said nothing.</t4014>
<t4015>––After having seen him now, I would never have believed that he could behave as badly as he did with Wickham ––continued Mrs. Gardiner––, he doesn't seem heartless.</t4015> <t4016>On the contrary, he has a very pleasant expression when he speaks.</t4016> <t4017>And there is also a dignity in his face that would make no one think he doesn't have a good heart.</t4017> <t4018>But, to tell the truth, the good woman who showed us the house exaggerated his character a bit.</t4018> <t4019>There were times when I almost burst out laughing.</t4019> <t4020>The thing is, he must be a very generous master and that, in the eyes of a servant, equals all virtues.</t4020>
<t4021>Upon hearing this, Elizabeth believed she should say something in defense of Darcy's conduct with Wickham.</t4021> <t4022>With all the care she could muster, she tried to hint that, based on what she had heard from her relatives in Kent, his actions could be interpreted very differently, and that neither his character was as bad nor Wickham's as good as had been believed in Hertfordshire.</t4022> <t4023>To confirm what she had said, she recounted the details of all the financial transactions that had taken place between them, without mentioning how she had come to know them, but asserting that it was strictly true.</t4023>
<t4024>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and curious about the topic, but as they were approaching the scene of her former pleasures, she yielded to the charm of her memories and only pointed out to her husband all the interesting places and their surroundings.</t4024> <t4025>Despite being tired from the morning walk, as soon as they had dinner, they went out in search of old acquaintances, and the evening passed with the satisfaction of relationships renewed after many years of interruption.</t4025>
<t4026>The events of that day had been too overwhelming for Elizabeth to pay much attention to any of those new friends, and she could only think with admiration of Darcy's kindnesses, and especially of his desire for her to meet his sister.</t4026>
<t4027>CHAPTER XLIV</t4027>
<t4028>Elizabeth had calculated that Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the day after their arrival at Pemberley, and consequently, she resolved not to lose sight of the inn all that morning.</t4028> <t4029>But she was mistaken, for she received the visit the very day they arrived.</t4029> <t4030>The Gardiners and Elizabeth had been walking around the town with some of their new friends, and were returning at that moment to the inn to dress and go to lunch with them, when the noise of a carriage made them look out the window and they saw a gentleman and a young lady in a cabriolet coming up the street.</t4030> <t4031>Elizabeth instantly recognized the livery of the footmen, guessed what it meant, and left her uncles astonished by informing them of the honor that awaited them.</t4031> <t4032>They were frightened; that visit, Elizabeth's bewilderment, and the circumstances of the previous day made them form a new idea of the matter.</t4032> <t4033>There had been nothing to suggest it before, but now they realized that there was no other way to explain Darcy's attentions than by supposing him interested in their niece.</t4033> <t4034>While they were thinking about all this, Elizabeth's agitation increased by the moment.</t4034> <t4035>She was alarmed by her own bewilderment, and among the other causes of her unease was the idea that Darcy, in his enthusiasm, might have spoken of her to his sister with too much praise.</t4035> <t4036>She wanted to please more than ever, but suspected that she would not be able to achieve it.</t4036>
<t4037>She withdrew from the window for fear of being seen, and, while pacing back and forth in the room, the questioning looks from her uncles made her even more nervous.</t4037>
<t4038>Finally, Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and the grand introduction took place.</t4038> <t4039>Elizabeth noticed with astonishment that her new acquaintance was at least as disturbed as she was.</t4039> <t4040>Since arriving in Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was extremely proud, but after observing her for a few minutes, she was convinced that she was only extremely shy.</t4040> <t4041>She could hardly get a word out of her, except for a few monosyllables.</t4041>
<t4042>Miss Darcy was taller than Elizabeth and, although she was only sixteen years old, her body was already developed and her appearance was very feminine and graceful.</t4042> <t4043>She was not as beautiful as her brother, but her face revealed intelligence and good character, and her manners were very simple and gentle.</t4043> <t4044>Elizabeth, who had feared that she might be as sharp and outgoing an observer as Darcy, felt great relief to see how different she was.</t4044>
<t4045>They had been conversing for only a short while when Darcy told Elizabeth that Bingley would also be coming to visit her, and she had barely had time to express her satisfaction and prepare to receive him when they heard Bingley's hurried steps on the stairs, and he immediately entered the room.</t4045> <t4046>All of Elizabeth's indignation against him had long since disappeared, but if any resentment had remained, she could not have resisted the frank cordiality that Bingley showed her upon seeing her again.</t4046> <t4047>He inquired about her family in a caring, albeit general, manner, and behaved and spoke with his usual good humor.</t4047>
<t4048>The Gardiners welcomed Bingley with the same interest as Elizabeth.</t4048> <t4049>They had long wanted to meet him.</t4049> <t4050>In truth, all those present inspired the liveliest curiosity in them.</t4050> <t4051>The suspicions they had just conceived about Darcy and his niece led them to focus their attention on them, examining them closely, though discreetly, and very soon they realized that at least one of them was very much in love.</t4051> <t4052>Elizabeth's feelings were somewhat doubtful, but it was evident that Darcy was overflowing with admiration in every way.</t4052>
<t4053>Elizabeth, for her part, had a lot to do.</t4053> <t4054>She had to guess the feelings of each of her visitors and at the same time had to contain her own and make herself pleasant to everyone.</t4054> <t4055>It is true that the last part, which was what scared her the most, was what she could achieve most confidently, as the interested parties were already very predisposed in her favor.</t4055> <t4056>Bingley was ready, Georgiana desired it, and Darcy was completely decided.</t4056>
<t4057>Upon seeing Bingley, Elizabeth's thoughts naturally flew to her sister, and she diligently observed whether any of his thoughts were going in the same direction.</t4057> <t4058>She deluded herself into thinking that he spoke less than on other occasions, and once or twice she took pleasure in the idea that, when he looked at her, Bingley was trying to find a resemblance.</t4058> <t4059>But, even if all that were just her fantasies, she could not be mistaken about his behavior towards Miss Darcy, who had been spoken of as Jane's presumed rival.</t4059> <t4060>She did not notice a single glance from either of them that could justify the hopes of Bingley's sister.</t4060> <t4061>Regarding this matter, she was completely satisfied.</t4061> <t4062>Before they left, she still noticed from two or three small details that Bingley remembered Jane tenderly and seemed to want to say something more but did not dare.</t4062> <t4063>At a moment when the others were conversing, he said it in a sorrowful tone:</t4063>
<t4064>––How long it has been since I had the pleasure of seeing you!</t4064>
<t4065>And, before Elizabeth had time to respond, he added:</t4065>
<t4066>––About eight months ago.</t4066> <t4067>We hadn't seen each other since the twenty-sixth of November when we all danced together at Netherfield.</t4067>
<t4068>Elizabeth was glad to see that her memory did not fail her.</t4068> <t4069>Then, taking advantage of the others being distracted, she asked him if all his sisters were at Longbourn.</t4069> <t4070>Neither the question nor the previous memory were important, but Bingley's look and gesture were very significant.</t4070>
<t4071>Elizabeth did not look at Darcy very often; but when she did, she saw in him an expression of contentment and in what he said she perceived a tone that erased all disdain or haughtiness towards his companions, and convinced her that the improvement in his character that she had witnessed the previous day, even if fleeting, had lasted, at least, until now.</t4071> <t4072>Seeing him trying to be sociable, seeking the good opinion of those present, with whom having any dealings a few months ago would have meant disgrace for him; seeing him so courteous, not only with her, but with the very relatives he had despised, and remembering the violent scene at the parsonage in Hunsford, the difference, the change was so great, that she could barely prevent her astonishment from becoming visible.</t4072> <t4073>Never, neither in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, nor in that of his haughty relatives at Rosings, had she found him so eager to please, so devoid of self-importance or reserve, as now when no vanity could be gained from the success of his endeavor, and when dealing with those he showered with attentions would have been censured and ridiculed by the ladies of Netherfield and Rosings.</t4073>
<t4074>The visit lasted about half an hour, and when they stood up to say goodbye, Darcy asked his sister to support the invitation to the Gardiners and Miss Bennet, so that they would come to dine at Pemberley before leaving the area.</t4074> <t4075>Miss Darcy, although with a shyness that revealed her little habit of making invitations, obeyed immediately.</t4075> <t4076>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece to see how she, to whom the invitation was directed, would receive it; but Elizabeth had turned her head away.</t4076> <t4077>She presumed, however, that her studied evasion meant more a momentary confusion than displeasure at the proposition, and seeing her husband, who was very fond of social life, eager to accept, she ventured to accept on behalf of the three; and the date was set for two days later.</t4077>
<t4078>Bingley expressed his delight at knowing he would see Elizabeth again, as he still had many things to tell her and many questions to ask about all the friends in Hertfordshire.</t4078> <t4079>Elizabeth believed she understood that he wished to hear her speak of her sister, and she was very pleased.</t4079> <t4080>This and some other details of the visit left her inclined, as soon as their friends had left, to recall it with pleasure, even though she had felt a bit uncomfortable during the visit.</t4080> <t4081>Eager to be alone and fearful of her uncles' questions or suppositions, she stayed with them just long enough to hear their favorable comments about Bingley, and then hurried to get dressed.</t4081>
<t4082>But she was very wrong to fear the curiosity of the Gardiners, who had no intention of making her talk.</t4082> <t4083>It was evident that her relationship with Darcy was much more serious than they had believed, and it was clearer than water that he was deeply in love with her.</t4083> <t4084>They had seen many things that interested them, but they did not justify their inquiry.</t4084>
<t4085>The important thing now was that Darcy was a good boy.</t4085> <t4086>As far as they could have appreciated, he had no faults.</t4086> <t4087>His kindnesses had moved them, and if they had had to describe his character according to their own opinion and according to the reports of their maid, disregarding any other reference, they would have done so in such a way that the Hertfordshire circle who knew him would not have recognized him.</t4087> <t4088>They now wished to give credit to the housekeeper and soon agreed that the testimony of a maid who had known him since he was four years old and who seemed so respectable, could not be questioned.</t4088> <t4089>On the other hand, there was nothing in what his friends from Lambton said that could diminish the weight of that testimony.</t4089> <t4090>They accused him of nothing more than pride; proud he may have been, but even if he had not been, the inhabitants of that small commercial town, where the Pemberley family never went, would have attributed the label to him just the same.</t4090> <t4091>But they said he was very generous and did a lot of good among the poor.</t4091>
<t4092>As for Wickham, the travelers soon saw that he was not held in high regard there; the main details of his relationship with his master's son were unknown, but it was well known that upon leaving Derbyshire he had left behind a multitude of debts that Darcy had paid.</t4092>
<t4093>Elizabeth thought about Pemberley that night even more than the previous one.</t4093> <t4094>It seemed very long to her, but not long enough to determine her feelings towards one of the inhabitants of the mansion.</t4094> <t4095>After going to bed, she stayed awake for two hours trying to decipher them.</t4095> <t4096>She did not hate him, no; the hatred had vanished long ago, and for almost all that time she had been ashamed of having felt a dislike towards that person that could bear such a name.</t4096> <t4097>The respect due to his valuable qualities, although admitted at first against her will, had contributed to the cessation of the hostility of her feelings, and these had evolved into affectionate ones in light of the significant testimony in his favor that she had heard and the good disposition he himself had shown the previous day.</t4097> <t4098>But above all that, above respect and esteem, Elizabeth felt another impulse of benevolence towards Darcy that could not be overlooked.</t4098> <t4099>It was gratitude; gratitude not only for having loved her, but for still loving her enough to forget all the petulance and sharpness of her rejection and all the unjust accusations that accompanied it.</t4099> <t4100>He, who should consider her ––so Elizabeth supposed–– as his greatest enemy, upon meeting her by chance seemed eager to maintain her friendship, and without any display of indelicacy or affectation in his manner, in a matter that only concerned the two of them, sought the good opinion of her friends and decided to introduce her to his sister.</t4100> <t4101>Such a change in a man so proud not only had to inspire astonishment, but also gratitude, for it had to be attributed to love, to a passionate love.</t4101> <t4102>But, although this impression was encouraging and very contrary to dislike, she could not define it precisely.</t4102> <t4103>She respected him, esteemed him, was grateful to him, and earnestly wished for his happiness.</t4103> <t4104>She only needed to know to what extent she wished that happiness to depend on her, and to what extent it would result in the happiness of both if she used the power she imagined she still possessed to induce him to renew his proposal.</t4104>
<t4105>In the afternoon, the aunt and niece agreed that such an extraordinary attention as the visit from Miss Darcy on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley—where she had arrived shortly after breakfast—should be reciprocated, if not with something equivalent, at least with some special courtesy.</t4105> <t4106>Therefore, they decided to visit her at Pemberley the next morning.</t4106> <t4107>Elizabeth felt happy, although when she asked herself why, she couldn't find an answer.</t4107>
<t4108>After breakfast, Mr. Gardiner left them.</t4108> <t4109>The offer to go fishing had been renewed the previous day, and he had been assured that one of the gentlemen from Pemberley would accompany him at noon.</t4109>
<t4110>CHAPTER XLV</t4110>
<t4111>Elizabeth was now convinced that Miss Bingley's antipathy towards her stemmed from jealousy.</t4111> <t4112>She understood, therefore, how unpleasant it must be for her to see her appear at Pemberley and wondered with curiosity how much courtesy she would muster to resume their relations.</t4112>
<t4113>Upon arriving at the house, they crossed the vestibule and entered the living room, whose northward orientation made it delightful in summer.</t4113> <t4114>The wide-open windows offered a refreshing view of the tall, forested hills behind the building, and of the beautiful oaks and chestnut trees of Spain scattered across the meadow that stretched out in front of the house.</t4114>
<t4115>In that room, they were received by Miss Darcy, who was waiting for them along with Mrs. Hurst, Miss Bingley, and her companion.</t4115> <t4116>Georgiana's welcome was very courteous, but dominated by that shyness due to her timidity and the fear of doing things wrong, which had given her a reputation of being proud and reserved among her inferiors.</t4116> <t4117>But Mrs. Gardiner and her niece understood and sympathized with her.</t4117>
<t4118>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley made a simple bow and sat down.</t4118> <t4119>An extremely awkward silence ensued, lasting for a few moments.</t4119> <t4120>It was interrupted by Mrs. Annesley, a kind and pleasant person who, in attempting to break the ice, showed better manners than any of the other ladies.</t4120> <t4121>The conversation continued between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with some contributions from Elizabeth.</t4121> <t4122>Miss Darcy seemed to wish she had the confidence to take part in the conversation, and occasionally ventured a short sentence when there was the least danger of being overheard.</t4122>
<t4123>Elizabeth immediately realized that Miss Bingley was closely watching her and that she couldn't say a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without the other sharpening her ears.</t4123> <t4124>However, her tenacious observation would not have prevented her from speaking with Georgiana if they hadn't been so distant from each other; but she was not distressed by not being able to speak much, as it allowed her to think more freely.</t4124> <t4125>She both wished for and feared the arrival of the master of the house, and she could hardly clarify whether she feared it more than she desired it.</t4125> <t4126>After being like this for a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth blushed when the latter asked her how her family was.</t4126> <t4127>She replied with the same indifference and brevity, and the other said nothing more.</t4127>
<t4128>The first variety of the visit consisted of the appearance of some servants who brought cold cuts, pastries, and some of the best fruits of the season, but this happened after many significant looks from Mrs. Annesley to Georgiana to remind her of her duties.</t4128> <t4129>This distracted the gathering, for, although not all the ladies could talk, at least all could eat.</t4129> <t4130>The beautiful pyramids of grapes, apricots, and peaches immediately gathered them around the table.</t4130>
<t4131>While they were engaged in this, Elizabeth began to ponder whether she feared or desired Darcy's arrival due to the effect his presence would have on her; and although a moment before she believed she rather desired it, she now began to think the opposite.</t4131>
<t4132>Darcy had been with Mr. Gardiner, who was fishing in the river with two or three other gentlemen, but upon learning that the ladies of his family planned to visit Georgiana that very morning, he went home.</t4132> <t4133>Upon seeing him enter, Elizabeth resolved to appear as natural as possible, a necessary but difficult task, as she was aware that the entire gathering was focused on them, and as soon as Darcy arrived, all eyes turned to examine him.</t4133> <t4134>But no face showed curiosity as strongly as Miss Bingley's, despite the smiles she lavished while speaking with anyone; however, her jealousy had not reached the point of making her desist from her attentions to Darcy––.</t4134> <t4135>Georgiana, as soon as her brother entered, made more effort to speak, and Elizabeth understood that Darcy wanted the two to become close, for which he encouraged all attempts at conversation from both sides.</t4135> <t4136>Miss Bingley also noticed this and with the imprudence typical of her anger, seized the first opportunity to say with mocking finesse:</t4136>
<t4137>––Tell me, Miss Elizabeth, is it true that the Meryton garrison has been relocated?</t4137> <t4138>It must have been a great loss for your family.</t4138>
<t4139>In Darcy's presence, she did not dare to utter Wickham's name, but Elizabeth guessed that he had that name in his thoughts; the various memories it evoked distressed her for a moment, but she composed herself with fortitude to repel that brazen attack and answered the question in a nonchalant tone.</t4139> <t4140>In doing so, an involuntary glance made her see Darcy, with his face flushed, watching her intently, and his sister completely confused and unable to lift her eyes.</t4140> <t4141>If Miss Bingley could have suspected how much it pained her beloved, she would undoubtedly have refrained; but she had only tried to unsettle Elizabeth by bringing up something related to a man for whom she had been partial, and to provoke her into some misstep that would harm her in Darcy's eyes and, incidentally, remind him of the absurdities and follies of the Bennet family.</t4141> <t4142>She did not know a word about Miss Darcy's elopement, as it had been kept strictly secret, and Elizabeth was the only person to whom it had been revealed.</t4142> <t4143>Darcy wanted to conceal it from all of Bingley's relatives for that same desire, which Elizabeth had attributed to him for so long, of becoming part of their family.</t4143> <t4144>Darcy, in fact, had this purpose, and although it was not for this reason that he sought to separate his friend from Jane, it is likely that it added to his keen interest in Bingley's happiness.</t4144>
<t4145>But Elizabeth's attitude reassured him.</t4145> <t4146>Miss Bingley, humiliated and disappointed, did not dare to allude to anything related to Wickham again.</t4146> <t4147>Georgiana began to recover, but she remained definitively silent, not daring to face her brother's gaze.</t4147> <t4148>Darcy did not dwell on what had happened, but instead of putting Elizabeth out of his mind, Miss Bingley's insinuation seemed to excite his passion even more.</t4148>
<t4149>After the aforementioned question and answer, the visit did not last much longer, and while Darcy accompanied the ladies to the carriage, Miss Bingley vented by criticizing Elizabeth's behavior and attire.</t4149> <t4150>But Georgiana paid her no mind.</t4150> <t4151>Her brother's interest in Miss Bennet was more than enough to ensure her approval; his judgment was infallible, and he had spoken of Elizabeth in such terms that Georgiana had to find her amiable and attractive.</t4151> <t4152>When Darcy returned to the drawing room, Miss Bingley could not contain herself and had to repeat some of what she had already said to her sister:</t4152>
<t4153>––How poorly Elizabeth Bennet looked, Mr. Darcy! ––she exclaimed––.</t4153> <t4154>How changed I found her since the winter!</t4154> <t4155>How tanned and unrefined she has become!</t4155> <t4156>Neither Louisa nor I would have recognized her.</t4156>
<t4157>The remark amused Darcy very little, but he restrained himself and replied coldly that he had noticed no other change than being tanned by the sun, which was very natural when traveling in summer.</t4157>
<t4158>––For my part ––continued Miss Bingley, I confess that she has never seemed pretty to me.</t4158> <t4159>Her face is too thin, her complexion is dull, and her features are not at all attractive; her nose has no character and there is nothing remarkable about its lines; she has passable teeth, but they are nothing out of the ordinary, and as for her much-praised eyes, I do not see anything extraordinary about them, they look in a penetrating and stern way that is very unpleasant; and in her whole demeanor, in short, there is so much pretension and a lack of good taste that it is intolerable.</t4159>
<t4160>Knowing as Miss Bingley did that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not at all the best way to please him, but irritated people do not usually act wisely; and seeing that she was provoking him, she achieved the success she expected.</t4160> <t4161>However, he remained silent, but Miss Bingley was determined to make him speak and continued:</t4161>
<t4162>––I remember that the first time we saw her in Hertfordshire, we were surprised that she had a reputation for being beautiful; and I especially remember that one night when they had dined at Netherfield, you said: "If she is a beauty, her mother is a genius!"</t4162> <t4163>But afterwards, it seemed that you started to like her, and I believe you came to consider her pretty at some point.</t4163>
<t4164>––Yes ––replied Darcy, unable to contain himself any longer––, but that was when I first started to get to know her, because for many months now I have considered her one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen.</t4164>
<t4165>Having said this, he left, and Miss Bingley was very pleased to have forced him to say what only hurt her.</t4165>
<t4166>On the way back from Lambton, Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth discussed everything that had happened during the visit, except for what interested them both the most.</t4166> <t4167>They talked about the appearance and behavior of everyone, without mentioning the person to whom they had paid the most attention.</t4167> <t4168>They spoke about his sister, his friends, his house, his fruits, everything except for him, despite Elizabeth's desire to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of Darcy, and how much Mrs. Gardiner would have been pleased if her niece had brought up the subject.</t4168>
<t4169>CHAPTER XLVI</t4169>
<t4170>Upon arriving at Lambton, Elizabeth was displeased not to find a letter from Jane; the displeasure was renewed every morning, but on the third day, she received two letters at once, one of which contained a note saying that it had been misplaced and sent to another location, which did not surprise Elizabeth, because Jane had addressed it very poorly.</t4170>
<t4171>At the moment the two letters arrived, they were about to go for a walk, and to let her enjoy them quietly, her uncles went off alone.</t4171> <t4172>Elizabeth first read the lost letter, which was five days late.</t4172> <t4173>At first, it recounted the small gatherings and invitations, and gave the few news that the countryside allowed; but the last half, dated a day later and written with evident agitation, said much more important things:</t4173>
<t4174>After having written the above, dearest Elizabeth, something very serious and unexpected has occurred; but do not be alarmed, we are all well.</t4174> <t4175>What I am going to tell you concerns poor Lydia.</t4175> <t4176>Last night at eleven, when we were going to bed, an express arrived sent by Colonel Forster to inform us that our sister had eloped to Scotland with one of the officers; to be blunt: with Wickham.</t4176> <t4177>Imagine our surprise.</t4177> <t4178>However, Catherine did not find it surprising at all.</t4178> <t4179>I am very sad.</t4179> <t4180>What imprudence on the part of both!</t4180> <t4181>But I want to hope for the best and that Wickham is not as bad as believed, that he is merely frivolous and indiscreet; for what he has done ––let us be glad of it–– does not indicate a bad heart.</t4181> <t4182>His choice, after all, is disinterested, because he knows that our father cannot give Lydia anything.</t4182> <t4183>Our poor mother is dismayed.</t4183> <t4184>Father is taking it better.</t4184> <t4185>How right we were not to tell them what we knew about Wickham!</t4185> <t4186>We ourselves must forget it.</t4186> <t4187>It is supposed that they eloped on Saturday at about twelve, but they were not missed until yesterday at eight in the morning.</t4187> <t4188>They immediately sent the express.</t4188> <t4189>Dear Elizabeth, they must have passed less than ten miles from you!</t4189> <t4190>Colonel Forster says he will come at once.</t4190> <t4191>Lydia left a few lines written for Mrs. Forster informing her of her intentions.</t4191> <t4192>I have to finish, for I cannot extend myself because of my poor mother.</t4192> <t4193>I fear you will not understand what is written, for I do not even know what I have put.</t4193>
<t4194>Without taking time to reflect and barely knowing what she felt after finishing the reading of this letter, Elizabeth impatiently opened the other one and read the following, written a day later:</t4194>
<t4195>By this time, dearest sister, you will have received my hurried letter.</t4195><t4196>I hope this one is more intelligible; but, although I have time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot be coherent.</t4196><t4197>Dear Eliza, I would rather not write to you, but I have bad news to give you and I cannot delay it.</t4197><t4198>However imprudent the marriage of Wickham and our poor Lydia may be, we are anxious to know that it has already taken place, for there are ample reasons to fear that they have not gone to Scotland.</t4198><t4199>Colonel Forster arrived yesterday; he left Brighton a few hours after the couple themselves.</t4199><t4200>Although Lydia's letter to Mrs. Forster implied that they were going to Gretna Green, Denny said that he was aware and that Wickham never intended to go there nor to marry Lydia; upon learning this, Colonel Forster became alarmed and immediately left Brighton with the idea of catching up with them.</t4200><t4201>He indeed followed their trail easily to Clapham, but could not continue further, because upon reaching that point they took a hired carriage, leaving the post chaise that had brought them from Epsom.</t4201><t4202>And nothing more is known except that they were seen taking the road to London.</t4202><t4203>I do not know what to think.</t4203><t4204>After making all possible inquiries from there to London, Colonel Forster came to Hertfordshire to repeat them at all the toll gates and inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any result; no one has seen those persons there.</t4204><t4205>With the greatest regret, he arrived at Longbourn to inform us of everything, in a manner that does him honor.</t4205><t4206>I am truly sorry for him and his wife; no one can reproach them.</t4206><t4207>Our grief is very great.</t4207><t4208>Father and mother expect the worst, but I cannot believe that Wickham is so wicked.</t4208><t4209>Many circumstances may have driven them to marry secretly in the capital instead of following their first plan; and even in the case that he had plotted the ruin of a girl from a good family like Lydia, which is not likely, should I believe her so lost?</t4209><t4210>Impossible.</t4210><t4211>It dismays me, however, to see that Colonel Forster does not trust that they have married; when I expressed my hopes to him, he shook his head and expressed his fear that Wickham is not to be trusted.</t4211><t4212>My poor mother is truly ill and does not leave her room.</t4212><t4213>As for my father, I have never seen him so affected.</t4213><t4214>Poor Catherine is desperate for having concealed Lydia and Wickham's romance, but it is not surprising that the girls confided in each other.</t4214><t4215>Dearest Lizzy, I am sincerely glad that you have been spared these painful scenes.</t4215><t4216>But now that the first blow has passed, I confess that I long for your return.</t4216><t4217>I am not selfish, however, to the extent of asking you to come back if you cannot.</t4217><t4218>Goodbye.</t4218><t4219>I take up the pen again to do what I just told you I would not do, but the circumstances are such that I cannot help but implore the three of you to come as soon as possible.</t4219><t4220>I know our dear uncles so well that I do not doubt they will agree.</t4220><t4221>I also have another request to make of our uncle.</t4221><t4222>My father is going to London with Colonel Forster to see if they can find her.</t4222><t4223>I do not know what they plan to do, but he is so dejected that he will not be able to take the best and most expeditious measures, and Colonel Forster has no choice but to be in Brighton by tomorrow night.</t4223><t4224>In this situation, our uncle's advice and assistance would be of great help.</t4224><t4225>He will understand this; I count on his kindness.</t4225>
<t4226>––Where, where is my uncle?</t4226> <t4227>––exclaimed Elizabeth, rising from the chair as soon as she finished reading and determined not to lose a single moment; but as she reached the door, a servant opened it and Darcy entered.</t4227> <t4228>Elizabeth's pale countenance and urgency alarmed him.</t4228> <t4229>Before he could recover enough to speak to her, Elizabeth, who could think of nothing but Lydia's situation, exclaimed hastily:</t4229>
<t4230>––Excuse me, but I have to leave you; I need to speak with Mr. Gardiner immediately about a matter that cannot be delayed; there is no time to lose.</t4230>
<t4231>––My God! What is this about? ––he asked with more feeling than courtesy; then, recovering himself, he said––: I don't want to detain you for even a minute; but allow me to be the one to go in search of Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner or send a servant.</t4231> <t4232>You cannot go in those conditions.</t4232>
<t4233>Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees were trembling and she realized that she would gain nothing by trying to catch up with them.</t4233> <t4234>Consequently, she called the servant and instructed him to bring her masters without delay, although she gave the order in such a faint voice that she was barely heard.</t4234>
<t4235>When the servant left the room, Elizabeth collapsed into a chair, unable to support herself.</t4235> <t4236>She looked so distraught that Darcy could not leave her without saying in an affectionate and compassionate tone:</t4236>
<t4237>––I am going to call your maid.</t4237> <t4238>What could you take to feel better?</t4238> <t4239>A glass of wine?</t4239> <t4240>I am going to bring it to you.</t4240> <t4241>You are sick.</t4241>
<t4242>––No, thank you ––replied Elizabeth, trying to calm herself––.</t4242> <t4243>It's nothing of mine.</t4243> <t4244>I am fine.</t4244> <t4245>The only thing that happens to me is that I am devastated by a horrible news I just received from Longbourn.</t4245>
<t4246>Upon saying this, she burst into tears and was unable to speak for a few minutes.</t4246> <t4247>Darcy, distressed and in suspense, said nothing more than a few vague remarks about his interest in her, and then watched her in silence.</t4247> <t4248>Finally, Elizabeth continued:</t4248>
<t4249>––I have had a letter from Jane, and she gives me some dreadful news that cannot be concealed from anyone.</t4249> <t4250>My younger sister has abandoned us, she has eloped, she has given herself to... Wickham.</t4250> <t4251>The two have escaped from Brighton.</t4251> <t4252>You know Wickham too well to understand what that means.</t4252> <t4253>Lydia has no money nor anything that could have tempted him...</t4253> <t4254>She is lost forever.</t4254>
<t4255>Darcy stood motionless in astonishment.</t4255>
<t4256>––When I think ––added Elizabeth even more agitatedly–– that I could have prevented it!</t4256> <t4257>I who knew who Wickham was!</t4257> <t4258>If I had explained to my family just a part, something of what I knew about him!</t4258> <t4259>If they had known him, this would not have happened.</t4259> <t4260>But now it is too late for everything.</t4260>
<t4261>––I am horrified ––exclaimed Darcy––.</t4261> <t4262>But is it true, absolutely true?</t4262>
<t4263>––Unfortunately!</t4263> <t4264>They left Brighton on Sunday night and their tracks have been followed up to near London, but no further; it is certain that they have not gone to Scotland.</t4264>
<t4265>––And what has been done, what have they tried to do to find her?</t4265>
<t4266>––My father has gone to London and Jane writes requesting my uncle's immediate help; I hope we will leave within half an hour.</t4266> <t4267>But nothing can be done, I know nothing can be done.</t4267> <t4268>How to convince such a man?</t4268> <t4269>How to discover them?</t4269> <t4270>I have not the slightest hope.</t4270> <t4271>Any way you look at it, it is horrible.</t4271>
<t4272>Darcy nodded silently.</t4272>
<t4273>––Oh, if only when I opened my eyes and saw who Wickham was, I had done what I should have!</t4273> <t4274>But I didn't dare, I feared I would go too far.</t4274> <t4275>What an unfortunate mistake!</t4275>
<t4276>Darcy did not respond.</t4276> <t4277>It seemed as if he didn't even hear her; he paced back and forth in the room, absorbed in his thoughts, with a frown and a somber air.</t4277> <t4278>Elizabeth watched him, and in an instant, she understood everything.</t4278> <t4279>The attraction he felt for her had ended; everything had ended before that proof of her family's unworthiness and the certainty of such profound misfortune.</t4279> <t4280>She neither found it strange nor could she blame him.</t4280> <t4281>But the belief that Darcy had recovered did not console her pain nor lessen her despair.</t4281> <t4282>On the contrary, it made the young woman realize her own feelings, and never had she felt so sincerely as at that moment that she could have loved him, when all love was already impossible.</t4282>
<t4283>But not even this consideration managed to distract her.</t4283> <t4284>She could not take Lydia, nor the humiliation and misfortune that had befallen them all, out of her mind.</t4284> <t4285>She covered her face with a handkerchief and forgot everything else.</t4285> <t4286>After several minutes of silence, she heard Darcy's voice, compassionate yet reserved, saying to her:</t4286>
<t4287>––I am afraid you want me to leave, and there is nothing that excuses my presence; but I have been moved by a genuine, though useless, interest.</t4287> <t4288>I wish I could say or do something to console you in such misfortune!</t4288> <t4289>But I do not want to torment you with vain wishes that would seem to be expressed only so that you would thank me.</t4289> <t4290>I believe this unfortunate matter is going to deprive my sister of the pleasure of seeing you today at Pemberley.</t4290>
<t4291>––Oh, yes!</t4291> <t4292>Please excuse us to Miss Darcy.</t4292> <t4293>Tell her that urgent matters call us home without delay.</t4293> <t4294>Hide the sad truth from her, although I know it won't be very easy for you.</t4294>
<t4295>Darcy promised to be discreet, expressed his sympathy once again for the misfortune, wished that the matter would not end as badly as could be expected, and, asking him to send his regards to his relatives, took his leave with just a serious look.</t4295>
<t4296>When Darcy left the room, Elizabeth realized how unlikely it was that they would see each other again with the cordiality that had characterized their encounters in Derbyshire.</t4296> <t4297>She recalled the history of her relations with Darcy, so full of contradictions and changes, and appreciated the perversity of the feelings that now made her wish those relations to continue, when before they had made her glad that they had ended.</t4297>
<t4298>If gratitude or esteem are good bases for affection, the transformation of Elizabeth's feelings will not seem improbable or condemnable.</t4298> <t4299>But if it is not so, if the interest that arises from this is less natural and reasonable than that which springs spontaneously, as often described, from the first meeting and before having exchanged two words with the object of said interest, only one thing can be said in Elizabeth's defense: that she tried this system with Wickham and the bad results it gave her perhaps authorized her to lean towards the other method, even if it was less passionate.</t4299> <t4300>Be that as it may, she saw Darcy leave with great sorrow, and this first example of the misfortunes that Lydia's infamy could cause increased the anguish she felt when thinking about that disastrous matter.</t4300>
<t4301>As soon as she read Jane's second letter, she did not believe that Wickham intended to marry Lydia.</t4301> <t4302>No one but Jane could have had that hope.</t4302> <t4303>Surprise was the last of her feelings.</t4303> <t4304>Upon reading the first letter, she was astonished that Wickham would marry a girl who was not a good match and did not understand how Lydia could have attracted him.</t4304> <t4305>But now she saw everything clearly.</t4305> <t4306>Lydia was pretty, and although she did not suppose she had committed to eloping without any intention of marriage, Elizabeth knew that neither her virtue nor her good judgment could preserve her from falling as an easy prey.</t4306>
<t4307>While the regiment was in Hertfordshire, she never noticed that Lydia was attracted to Wickham; but she was convinced that she only needed a little attention to fall in love with anyone.</t4307> <t4308>She liked one officer as soon as another, depending on the attention they paid her.</t4308> <t4309>She had always flitted about, without any fixed object.</t4309> <t4310>How they were now paying for the neglect and indulgence with which they had raised that girl!</t4310>
<t4311>She couldn't wait to be home to see, hear, and be there, and to share with Jane the care that such a troubled family required, with the father absent and the mother incapable of any effort and needing constant attention.</t4311> <t4312>Although she was almost convinced that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's help seemed of utmost importance to her, so until she saw him enter the room, she endured the torment of an impatient wait.</t4312> <t4313>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner returned hurriedly and alarmed, believing, from what the servant had told them, that their niece had suddenly fallen ill.</t4313> <t4314>Elizabeth reassured them on this point and immediately informed them of the reason for her call by reading them the two letters and insisting on the postscript with trembling energy.</t4314> <t4315>Although Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had never been very fond of Lydia, the news deeply affected them.</t4315> <t4316>The misfortune affected not only Lydia but everyone.</t4316> <t4317>After the initial exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner offered all the help he could.</t4317> <t4318>Elizabeth expected no less and thanked them with tears in her eyes.</t4318> <t4319>Moved by the same spirit, the three of them quickly arranged everything for the trip.</t4319>
<t4320>––And what shall we do about Pemberley? ––asked Mrs. Gardiner––.</t4320> <t4321>John has told us that Mr. Darcy was here when you sent him to fetch us.</t4321> <t4322>Is it true?</t4322>
<t4323>––Yes; I told him that we were not in a position to fulfill our commitment.</t4323> <t4324>That's already been settled.</t4324> <t4325>––That's already been settled ––repeated Mrs. Gardiner as she ran to the other room to get ready–.</t4325> <t4326>Are they on such close terms as to have revealed the truth to him?</t4326> <t4327>How I would love to find out what has happened!</t4327>
<t4328>But her curiosity was useless.</t4328> <t4329>At most, it served to entertain her in the rush and confusion of the next hour.</t4329> <t4330>If Elizabeth could have stayed idle, she would have believed that someone as miserable as she was incapable of any work, but she was as busy as her aunt and, to top it off, she had to write cards to all the friends in Lambton to explain their sudden departure with false excuses.</t4330> <t4331>Everything was dispatched within an hour.</t4331> <t4332>Meanwhile, Mr. Gardiner settled the inn's bill, and all that was left was to depart.</t4332> <t4333>After the sadness of the morning, Elizabeth found herself, in less time than she had supposed, seated in the carriage and heading towards Longbourn.</t4333>
<t4334>CHAPTER XLII</t4334>
<t4335>I've been thinking about it again, Elizabeth," her uncle said to her as they were leaving the city, "and finally, after serious consideration, I feel inclined to adopt your elder sister's opinion.</t4335> <t4336>It seems unlikely to me that Wickham would want to harm a girl who is not without protection or friends and who was living with the Forster family.</t4336> <t4337>He wouldn't assume that the girl's friends would stand idly by, nor that he would be readmitted to the regiment after such a grave offense to his colonel.</t4337> <t4338>The temptation is not proportional to the risk.</t4338>
<t4339>––Do you really believe that? ––asked Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.</t4339>
<t4340>––I am also beginning to share your uncle's opinion ––said Mrs. Gardiner––.</t4340> <t4341>It is too great a violation of decency, honor, and self-interest to have acted so lightly.</t4341> <t4342>I cannot admit that Wickham is so foolish.</t4342> <t4343>And you yourself, Elizabeth, do you hold him in such low regard to believe him capable of such madness?</t4343>
<t4344>––I don't believe he's capable of forgetting his own convenience, but he is capable of forgetting everything that doesn't pertain to it.</t4344> <t4345>I wish it were as you say!</t4345> <t4346>I don't dare to hope for it.</t4346> <t4347>And if not, why haven't they gone to Scotland?</t4347>
<t4348>––First of all ––replied Mr. Gardiner––, there is no evidence that they haven't gone.</t4348>
<t4349>––What better proof than having left the post chaise and taken a hired carriage?</t4349> <t4350>Besides, they did not go through the Barnet road.</t4350>
<t4351>––Well, suppose they are in London.</t4351> <t4352>They may have done it only for the purpose of hiding.</t4352> <t4353>It is not likely that either of them has plenty of money, and they might have thought it would be cheaper to get married in London than in Scotland, even if it is more difficult for them.</t4353>
<t4354>––But why the secrecy?</t4354> <t4355>Why do they have to marry in secret?</t4355> <t4356>You know from Jane that Wickham's closest friend assures that he never thought of marrying Lydia.</t4356> <t4357>Wickham will never marry a woman who doesn't have money, because he can't afford the expenses of a marriage.</t4357> <t4358>And what merits does Lydia have, what attractions, aside from her health, her youth, and her good humor, for Wickham to give up the possibility of making a good match for her?</t4358> <t4359>I can't accurately assess to what extent a dishonorable elopement will harm him in the Corps, as I am unaware of the measures taken in such cases, but as for your other objections, it seems difficult for them to hold up.</t4359> <t4360>Lydia has no brothers to intervene; and given my father's character, his indolence, and the little attention he has always paid to his family, Wickham might have believed he wouldn't take it too seriously.</t4360>
<t4361>––But how do you suppose that Lydia is so inconsiderate about everything except loving him, that she would agree to live with him in any other way than as his legitimate wife?</t4361>
<t4362>––It seems so ––replied Elizabeth with her eyes full of tears––, and it is dreadful to have to doubt the decency and virtue of a sister.</t4362> <t4363>But in reality, I don't know what to say.</t4363> <t4364>Perhaps I judge her wrongly, but she is very young, she has never been accustomed to thinking about serious matters, and for the last half year, or rather for an entire year, she has done nothing but chase after diversions and vanity.</t4364> <t4365>She has been allowed to indulge in idleness and frivolity and to do nothing but what she fancied.</t4365> <t4366>Since the county garrison was quartered in Meryton, she has thought of nothing but love, flirting, and the officers.</t4366> <t4367>She did everything she could to excite, how should I put it?, the susceptibility of her feelings, which are already quite lively by nature.</t4367> <t4368>And we all know that Wickham possesses in his person and manners all the charms that can captivate a woman.</t4368>
<t4369>––But you see ––insisted her aunt–– that your sister does not believe Wickham capable of such an offense.</t4369>
<t4370>––Jane never believes anything bad about anyone.</t4370> <t4371>Much less when it comes to something like this, until it has been proven to her.</t4371> <t4372>But Jane knows as well as I do who Wickham is.</t4372> <t4373>We both know that he is a libertine in every sense of the word, lacking integrity and honor, and that he is as false and deceitful as he is attractive.</t4373>
<t4374>––Are you sure? ––asked Mrs. Gardiner, who was burning with the desire to know the source of her niece's information.</t4374>
<t4375>––Absolutely sure ––replied Elizabeth, blushing––.</t4375> <t4376>I already told you the other day about his infamous behavior towards Mr. Darcy, and you yourself heard the last time in Longbourn how he spoke about the man who has treated him with such indulgence and generosity.</t4376> <t4377>And there is yet another circumstance that I am not authorized... that is not worth mentioning.</t4377> <t4378>The truth is that his lies about the Pemberley family are endless.</t4378> <t4379>From what he had told us about Miss Darcy, I believed she would be a haughty, reserved, and unpleasant girl.</t4379> <t4380>However, he knew that she was quite the opposite.</t4380> <t4381>He must know very well, as we have observed, how affectionate and simple she is.</t4381>
<t4382>––And Lydia isn't aware of any of this?</t4382> <t4383>How does she not know what Jane and you know?</t4383>
<t4384>––You are right.</t4384> <t4385>Until I was in Kent and met Mr. Darcy and his cousin Colonel Fitzwilliam, I did not know either.</t4385> <t4386>When I arrived home, the county garrison was set to leave Meryton within three weeks, so neither Jane, whom I informed of everything, nor I thought it necessary to disclose it; because what use would it be to ruin the good opinion they had of him in Hertfordshire?</t4386> <t4387>And when it was decided that Lydia would go with the Forsters to Brighton, it never occurred to me to reveal Wickham's true character to her, as it never crossed my mind that she would be in any danger of that kind.</t4387> <t4388>You can understand that I was far from suspecting that such disastrous consequences would ensue.</t4388>
<t4389>––When they moved the garrison to Brighton, did you have any idea that there was something between them?</t4389>
<t4390>––Not the slightest bit.</t4390> <t4391>I don't remember noticing any sign of affection from either one of them.</t4391> <t4392>If there had been anything, my family is certainly sharp enough to have noticed it!</t4392> <t4393>When Wickham joined the Corps, Lydia liked him a lot, but no more than the rest of us did.</t4393> <t4394>All the girls in Meryton and the surrounding areas went crazy over him during the first two months, but he never paid Lydia any special attention, so after a period of extravagant and unrestrained admiration, she forgot about him and turned her attention to other officers who paid her more attention.</t4394>
<t4395>Although few new things could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures about such an interesting matter, the travelers debated it throughout the entire journey.</t4395> <t4396>Elizabeth could not think of anything else.</t4396> <t4397>The sharpest of all agonies, self-reproach, prevented her from finding the slightest interval of relief or forgetfulness.</t4397>
<t4398>They walked as quickly as they could, spent the night at an inn, and arrived at Longbourn the next day at lunchtime.</t4398> <t4399>Elizabeth's only consolation was that she would not have kept Jane waiting too long.</t4399>
<t4400>The little Gardiners, drawn by the sight of a carriage, stood on the steps of the house as it made its way up the driveway.</t4400> <t4401>When the carriage stopped at the door, the joyful surprise that shone on their faces and made them jump around was the prelude to their welcome.</t4401>
<t4402>Elizabeth gave each one a kiss and ran to the hall, where she met Jane who was hurrying down from their mother's room.</t4402>
<t4403>They embraced warmly, with eyes full of tears, and Elizabeth asked without wasting a second if there had been any news of the fugitives.</t4403>
<t4404>––Not yet ––replied Jane––, but now that our dear uncle has arrived, I hope everything goes well.</t4404>
<t4405>––Is Dad in the capital?</t4405>
<t4406>––Yes, he left on Tuesday, as I wrote to you.</t4406>
<t4407>––And what news have you had of him?</t4407>
<t4408>––Few.</t4408> <t4409>On Wednesday, he sent me a few lines saying that he had arrived safely and giving me his address, as I had asked him to.</t4409> <t4410>He only added that he wouldn't write again until he had something important to tell us.</t4410>
<t4411>––And mom, how is she? How are all of you?</t4411>
<t4412>––Mom is fine, as far as I can see, although very downcast.</t4412> <t4413>She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all.</t4413> <t4414>She still hasn't left her room.</t4414> <t4415>Mary and Catherine are perfectly well, thank God.</t4415>
<t4416>––And you, how are you feeling? ––asked Elizabeth––.</t4416> <t4417>You look pale.</t4417> <t4418>You must have gone through so much!</t4418> <t4419>But Jane assured her that she was very well.</t4419> <t4420>Meanwhile, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, who had been busy with their children, arrived and put an end to the conversation between the two sisters.</t4420> <t4421>Jane ran to her aunt and uncle and welcomed and thanked them with tears and smiles.</t4421>
<t4422>Once gathered in the living room, the questions asked by Elizabeth were repeated by the others, and they saw that poor Jane had no new information.</t4422> <t4423>But her ardent confidence that everything would end well had not abandoned her; she still hoped that one of these mornings a letter from Lydia or her father would arrive explaining the events and perhaps announcing the marriage.</t4423>
<t4424>Mrs. Bennet, to whose room they all went up after their brief conversation, received them as expected: with tears and lamentations, reproaches against Wickham's villainous conduct, and complaints about her own sufferings, blaming everyone except the one who, due to her tolerance and poor judgment, was mainly responsible for her daughter's mistakes.</t4424>
<t4425>––If I had been able ––he said–– to carry out my plan of going to Brighton with my whole family, this would not have happened; but poor Lydia had no one to look after her.</t4425> <t4426>The Forsters should not have lost sight of her.</t4426> <t4427>If they had watched her closely, she would not have done such a thing, Lydia is not that kind of girl.</t4427> <t4428>I always knew that the Forsters were very unsuitable to take care of her, but no one listened to me, as always.</t4428> <t4429>My poor girl!</t4429> <t4430>And now Bennet has gone and I suppose he will challenge Wickham wherever he finds him, and since he will die in the duel, what will become of us?</t4430> <t4431>The Collins will throw us out of here before he is cold in his grave, and if you, my brother, do not assist us, I don't know what we will do.</t4431>
<t4432>Everyone protested against such terrifying ideas.</t4432> <t4433>Mr. Gardiner assured her that they would not lack his support and said that he planned to be in London the next day to help Mr. Bennet with all his efforts to find Lydia.</t4433>
<t4434>––Do not alarm yourselves needlessly ––he added––; although it is good to prepare for the worst, it should not be taken for granted.</t4434> <t4435>It has not even been a week since they left Brighton.</t4435> <t4436>In a few more days we will find out something; and until we know that they are not married and have no intentions of being so, let us not consider the matter lost.</t4436> <t4437>As soon as I arrive in London, I will pick up my brother and take him to Gracechurch Street; together we will deliberate on what needs to be done.</t4437>
<t4438>––Oh, my dear brother! exclaimed Mrs. Bennet––, that is precisely my greatest wish.</t4438> <t4439>When you get to London, find them wherever they are, and if they are not married, make them get married.</t4439> <t4440>Do not allow them to delay the wedding for the bridal gown, tell Lydia that she will have all the money she wants to buy it afterwards.</t4440> <t4441>And above all, prevent Bennet from dueling with Wickham.</t4441> <t4442>Tell him the horrible state I am in: shattered, distraught, with such trembling and agitation, such convulsions in my side, such headaches and such palpitations that I cannot rest either day or night.</t4442> <t4443>And tell my dear Lydia not to order her dresses until she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best stores.</t4443> <t4444>Oh, brother!</t4444> <t4445>How good you are!</t4445> <t4446>I know you will sort everything out.</t4446>
<t4447>Mr. Gardiner repeated to her that he would do everything he could and advised her to moderate her hopes and fears.</t4447> <t4448>He conversed with her in this manner until the meal was on the table, and left her to vent with the housekeeper who assisted her in the absence of her daughters.</t4448>
<t4449>Although his brother and sister-in-law were convinced that there was no reason for him not to come down to eat, they did not dare ask him to sit with them at the table, because they feared his imprudence in front of the servants and thought it preferable that only one of them, the one they could trust the most, should learn of his troubles.</t4449>
<t4450>In the dining room appeared Mary and Catherine, who had been too busy in their rooms to show up earlier.</t4450> <t4451>One had just put down her books and the other her vanity.</t4451> <t4452>But both were very calm and did not seem upset.</t4452> <t4453>Only the latter had a more irate tone than usual, whether due to the loss of the favorite sister or the anger of not finding herself in her place.</t4453> <t4454>Shortly after sitting at the table, Mary, very sure of herself, whispered to Elizabeth with an air of gravity in her reflection:</t4454>
<t4455>It is a very unfortunate matter and will probably be much talked about; but we must overcome the wave of malice and pour the balm of fraternal comfort over our wounded hearts.</t4455>
<t4456>Upon arriving here, he noticed that Elizabeth did not feel like answering, and added:</t4456>
<t4457>––Although it may be a misfortune for Lydia, for us it can be a valuable lesson: the loss of virtue in a woman is irreparable; a single misstep carries within it the final ruin; her reputation is no less fragile than her beauty, and she can never be cautious enough in her behavior towards the indignities of the other sex.</t4457>
<t4458>Elizabeth, astonished, raised her eyes, but she was too distressed to respond.</t4458> <t4459>Mary continued consoling herself with moral lessons of the sort drawn from the misfortune before them.</t4459>
<t4460>In the afternoon, the two eldest Bennet daughters were able to be alone for half an hour, and Elizabeth immediately took the opportunity to ask some questions that Jane was equally eager to answer.</t4460>
<t4461>After lamenting together about the terrible consequences of the event, which Elizabeth took for granted and the other could not assure were impossible, the former said:</t4461>
<t4462>Tell me everything I don't know.</t4462> <t4463>Give me more details.</t4463> <t4464>What did Colonel Forster say? Didn't he have any suspicion about the escape?</t4464> <t4465>They must have always seen them together.</t4465>
<t4466>––Colonel Forster confessed that he once noticed some interest, especially on Lydia's part, but he saw nothing that alarmed him.</t4466> <t4467>I feel sorry for him.</t4467> <t4468>He was most attentive and kind.</t4468> <t4469>He was planning to come see us before knowing they hadn't gone to Scotland, and when it was presumed they were in London, he hastened his trip.</t4469>
<t4470>––And Denny, was he convinced that Wickham would not get married?</t4470> <t4471>Did he know they were going to elope?</t4471> <t4472>Has Colonel Forster seen Denny?</t4472>
<t4473>––Yes, but when he was questioned, Denny said he wasn't aware of anything and refused to give his true opinion on the matter.</t4473> <t4474>He didn't repeat his conviction that they wouldn't get married, and that's why I think he might have misunderstood it.</t4474>
<t4475>––I suppose that until Colonel Forster came, no one in the house doubted that they were married.</t4475> <t4476>––How could such a thing occur to us?</t4476> <t4477>I felt sad because I know it is difficult for my sister to be happy marrying Wickham due to his terrible background.</t4477> <t4478>Our parents knew nothing of this, but they realized the imprudence of such a wedding.</t4478> <t4479>Then Catherine confessed, very satisfied to know more than us, that Lydia's last letter already hinted at what they were plotting.</t4479> <t4480>It seems that she said they had been in love for a few weeks.</t4480>
<t4481>––But not before going to Brighton.</t4481>
<t4482>––I don't think so.</t4482>
<t4483>––And Colonel Forster, does he have a bad opinion of Wickham? Does he know what he is really like?</t4483>
<t4484>––I must confess that he did not speak as well of him as before.</t4484> <t4485>He considers him imprudent and a spendthrift.</t4485> <t4486>And it is said that he has left great debts in Meryton, but I hope it is not true.</t4486>
<t4487>––Oh, Jane!</t4487> <t4488>If we hadn't been so reserved and had said what we knew about Wickham, this wouldn't have happened.</t4488>
<t4489>––Maybe it would have been better ––replied her sister––, but it is not fair to publish a person's past mistakes, ignoring whether they have corrected them.</t4489> <t4490>We acted in good faith.</t4490>
<t4491>––Did Colonel Forster repeat the details of the note that Lydia left for his wife?</t4491>
<t4492>––He brought it with him to show it to us.</t4492>
<t4493>Jane took it out of her purse and gave it to Elizabeth.</t4493> <t4494>This was its content:</t4494>
<t4495>Dear Harriet,</t4495>
<t4496>You will laugh when you find out where I have gone, and I can't stop laughing myself thinking about the fright you will get tomorrow when you don't find me.</t4496> <t4497>I'm going to Gretna Green, and if you don't guess with whom, I will think you're a fool, because he is the only man I love in the world, so I don't think I'm doing anything foolish by going with him.</t4497> <t4498>If you don't want to, don't tell my family, as it will be a bigger surprise when I write to them and sign as Lydia Wickham.</t4498> <t4499>It will be a great joke!</t4499> <t4500>I can hardly write from laughing.</t4500> <t4501>I beg you to excuse me with Pratt for not fulfilling my commitment to dance with him tonight; tell him I hope he will forgive me when he knows everything, and also that I will gladly dance with him at the first ball we meet.</t4501> <t4502>I will send for my dresses when I go to Longbourn, but tell Sally to fix the cut of the muslin dress from home before you pack it.</t4502> <t4503>Goodbye.</t4503> <t4504>Give my regards to Colonel Forster.</t4504> <t4505>I hope you will toast to our happy journey.</t4505>
<t4506>Affectionate greetings from your friend,</t4506>
<t4507>Lydia Bennet</t4507>
<t4508>––Oh, Lydia, how thoughtless!</t4508> <t4509>How thoughtless! ––exclaimed Elizabeth after finishing reading––.</t4509> <t4510>What a letter to be written at such a moment!</t4510> <t4511>But at least it seems she was serious about the purpose of her trip; we don't know what Wickham might have led her into, but Lydia's intention wasn't so infamous.</t4511> <t4512>Poor father of mine!</t4512> <t4513>How much he must have felt it!</t4513>
<t4514>––I have never seen anyone so overwhelmed.</t4514> <t4515>He couldn't say a word for ten minutes.</t4515> <t4516>Mom got sick immediately.</t4516> <t4517>There was such confusion throughout the whole house!</t4517>
<t4518>––Was there any servant who didn't find out about the whole story before the day ended?</t4518>
<t4519>––I don't know, I think not.</t4519> <t4520>But it was very difficult to be cautious in those moments.</t4520> <t4521>Mom became hysterical and although I assisted her as best as I could, I don't know if I did what I should have.</t4521> <t4522>The horror of what had happened almost made me lose consciousness.</t4522>
<t4523>––You have sacrificed too much for mom; you don't look well.</t4523> <t4524>I wish I had been by your side!</t4524> <t4525>That way you could have taken care of yourself.</t4525>
<t4526>––Mary and Catherine behaved very well and I have no doubt they would have helped me, but I did not think it convenient for either of them; Catherine is weak and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of rest should not be interrupted.</t4526> <t4527>Aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after father left, and she was so kind that she stayed with me until Thursday.</t4527> <t4528>She helped and encouraged us all a lot.</t4528> <t4529>Lady Lucas was also very kind: she came on Friday morning to offer her condolences and her services in any way possible, and to send any of her daughters if we thought they could be useful to us.</t4529>
<t4530>––It would have been better if he had stayed at home ––said Elizabeth––; his intentions may have been good, but in misfortunes like this, one should avoid neighbors.</t4530> <t4531>They cannot help us and their condolences are offensive.</t4531> <t4532>Let them take pleasure in criticizing us from a distance!</t4532>
<t4533>He then asked what measures his father planned to take in the capital in order to find his daughter.</t4533>
<t4534>––I think he intended to go to Epsom ––replied Jane––, which is where they last changed horses; he will talk to the postilions and see what he can find out from them.</t4534> <t4535>His main goal is to discover the number of the rental carriage they left Clapham with; which had come from London with a passenger; and since my father thinks that the fact a gentleman and a lady change carriages might be noticed, he wants to make inquiries in Clapham.</t4535> <t4536>If he could discover the house where the coachman dropped off the traveler, it wouldn't be difficult to find out what type of carriage it was and the number.</t4536> <t4537>I don't know what other plans he had; but he was in such a hurry to leave and was so distraught that this is all I could get out of him.</t4537>
<t4538>CHAPTER XLVIII</t4538>
<t4539>Everyone expected a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning; but the mail arrived and did not bring a single line from him.</t4539> <t4540>His family knew that he was not very fond of writing, but on this occasion, they believed he could well make an exception.</t4540> <t4541>They were, therefore, forced to assume that there was no good news; but even in that case, they preferred to have certainty.</t4541> <t4542>Mr. Gardiner waited only for the mail to arrive and then left.</t4542>
<t4543>When he left, everyone remained confident that this way, at least they would have constant information about what was happening.</t4543> <t4544>Mr. Gardiner promised them he would persuade Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as possible for the comfort of his wife, who considered his return as the only guarantee that he would not die in the duel.</t4544>
<t4545>Mrs. Gardiner and her children would remain in Hertfordshire a few more days, as she believed her presence would be useful to her nieces.</t4545> <t4546>She helped them take care of Mrs. Bennet and provided great relief during their free hours.</t4546> <t4547>Their other aunt visited them often with the intention, as she said, of encouraging them; but since she always recounted some new example of Wickham's extravagance and lack of scruples, she rarely left without making them even more disheartened.</t4547>
<t4548>The entire town of Meryton was bent on discrediting the man who only three months earlier had been regarded as an angel of light.</t4548> <t4549>It was said that he owed money to every shop in the city, and his intrigues, honored with the name of seductions, extended to all the families of the merchants.</t4549> <t4550>Everyone claimed that he was the most wicked young man in the world, and they began to say that they had always distrusted his apparent goodness.</t4550> <t4551>Elizabeth, despite not believing even half of what was being whispered, believed enough to reinforce her prior belief in her sister's ruin, and even Jane began to lose hope, especially when the time came that, had they gone to Scotland, news of them would have already been received.</t4551>
<t4552>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday and on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him.</t4552> <t4553>He told her that upon his arrival he had immediately gone in search of his brother-in-law and had taken him to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, but without any results, and that he now wanted to inquire at all the main inns in the city, as he believed it possible that they might have lodged in one of them upon their arrival in London, before securing other accommodations.</t4553> <t4554>Mr. Gardiner thought this attempt was futile, but since his brother-in-law was determined to carry it out, he would help him.</t4554> <t4555>He added that Mr. Bennet refused to leave London, and promised to write soon.</t4555> <t4556>In a postscript, he said the following:</t4556>
<t4557>I have written to Colonel Forster, begging him to find out from the friends of the regiment if Wickham has any relatives or connections who might know where in the city he will be hiding.</t4557> <t4558>If there were anyone to whom we could turn with any probability of obtaining that clue, it would advance us greatly.</t4558> <t4559>For now, there is nothing to guide us.</t4559> <t4560>I do not doubt that Colonel Forster will do everything in his power to please us, but perhaps Elizabeth can tell us better than anyone if Wickham has any relatives.</t4560>
<t4561>Elizabeth understood the reason for this allusion, but she could not respond to it.</t4561> <t4562>She had never heard if she had any relatives apart from her father and mother, who had died many years ago.</t4562> <t4563>But it was possible that one of her companions might be able to provide better information, and although she was not optimistic, she considered it wise to ask.</t4563>
<t4564>In Longbourn, the days passed with great anxiety, anxiety that grew with the arrival of the mail.</t4564> <t4565>Every morning they awaited the letters with impatience.</t4565> <t4566>By letter, they would learn of the good or bad progress of the matter, and each day they believed they would receive some important news.</t4566>
<t4567>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived from Hunsford for Mr. Bennet from his cousin Collins.</t4567> <t4568>Since Jane had been instructed to read everything received in her father's absence, she opened the letter.</t4568> <t4569>Elizabeth, who knew what Collins's letters were like, also read over her sister's shoulder.</t4569> <t4570>It read as follows:</t4570>
<t4571>"My dear sir,</t4571>
<t4572>Our kinship and my situation in life compel me to offer you my condolences for the grave affliction you are enduring, of which we were informed by a letter from Hertfordshire.</t4572> <t4573>Do not doubt that both Mrs. Collins and I share in the sorrow with you and your respectable family in this present calamity, which must be very bitter, as time cannot erase it.</t4573> <t4574>There will be no lack of arguments on my part to alleviate such a tremendous misfortune or to serve as consolation in circumstances that must be more painful for a father than for anyone else.</t4574> <t4575>The death of a daughter would have been a blessing compared to this.</t4575> <t4576>And it is more lamentable because there are reasons to suppose, according to my dear Charlotte, that this licentious behavior of your daughter stems from a deplorable excess of indulgence; although at the same time, for your and your wife's consolation, I am inclined to think that it must have been due to a perverse nature, for otherwise she would not have committed such an atrocity at such a young age.</t4576> <t4577>In any case, you are deserving of compassion, an opinion shared not only by Mrs. Collins but also by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the matter.</t4577> <t4578>They agree with me that this misstep by your daughter will be detrimental to the fortunes of the others; because, as Lady Catherine herself kindly says, who will want to ally themselves with such a family?</t4578> <t4579>This consideration moves me to recall with the greatest satisfaction a certain event from last November, for had things not gone as they did, I would now be involved in all your sadness and misfortune.</t4579> <t4580>Allow me, then, to advise you, dear sir, to resign yourself as much as possible and to remove your unworthy daughter from your heart forever, and let her reap the fruits of her abominable offense.</t4580>
<t4581>Mr. Gardiner did not write again until he had received a reply from Colonel Forster, but he could not say anything good.</t4581> <t4582>It was not known that Wickham had any relationship with any relatives, and it was assured that he had none close.</t4582> <t4583>He had formerly had many friends, but since his entry into the army, he seemed to have distanced himself from everyone.</t4583> <t4584>There was, therefore, no one capable of providing news of his whereabouts.</t4584> <t4585>There was a powerful reason for him to hide, which added to the fear of being discovered by Lydia's family, and it was that he had left behind a large amount of gambling debts.</t4585> <t4586>Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his accounts in Brighton.</t4586> <t4587>He owed much in the city, but his debts of honor were even higher.</t4587> <t4588>Mr. Gardiner did not dare to hide these details from the Longbourn family.</t4588> <t4589>Jane was horrified:</t4589>
<t4590>––A player!</t4590> <t4591>I didn't expect that.</t4591> <t4592>I couldn't imagine it!</t4592>
<t4593>Mr. Gardiner added in his letter that Mr. Bennet was going to return to Longbourn the next day, which was Saturday.</t4593> <t4594>Discouraged by the failure of his inquiries, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's insistence to return home and let him handle things while the circumstances were not more favorable for joint action.</t4594> <t4595>When they told Mrs. Bennet, she did not show the satisfaction that her daughters expected given her concerns for her husband's life.</t4595>
<t4596>––He is coming home without poor Lydia? she exclaimed––.</t4596> <t4597>I cannot believe he is leaving London without having found them.</t4597> <t4598>Who will challenge Wickham and make him marry, if Bennet returns?</t4598>
<t4599>Since Mrs. Gardiner was already eager to be at home, it was agreed that she would go to London with the children, taking advantage of Mr. Bennet's return.</t4599> <t4600>Consequently, the Longbourn carriage took them to the first stage of their journey and brought Mr. Bennet back.</t4600>
<t4601>Mrs. Gardiner left still perplexed at the thought of the chance encounter between Elizabeth and her friend from Derbyshire in that place.</t4601> <t4602>Elizabeth had refrained from mentioning his name, and that sort of semi-hope that her aunt had nurtured of receiving a letter from him upon arriving at Longbourn had come to nothing.</t4602> <t4603>Since their arrival, Elizabeth had not received any letter from Pemberley.</t4603>
<t4604>The unfortunate state of the entire family made any other excuse unnecessary to explain Elizabeth's dejection; nothing, therefore, could be conjectured about it, although Elizabeth, who by then knew where she stood regarding her feelings, was aware that, if not for Darcy, she would have better endured her fears about Lydia's disgrace.</t4604> <t4605>She would have spared herself one or two sleepless nights.</t4605>
<t4606>Mr. Bennet arrived with his usual philosophical demeanor.</t4606> <t4607>He spoke little, as always; he said nothing about the reason that had prompted his return, and some time passed before his daughters had the courage to speak on the subject.</t4607>
<t4608>In the afternoon, when she met with them at tea time, Elizabeth ventured to touch on the matter; she briefly expressed her sorrow for what her father must have suffered, and he replied:</t4608>
<t4609>––Let it be.</t4609> <t4610>Who else would suffer but me?</t4610> <t4611>It was my fault and it's only right that I pay for it.</t4611>
<t4612>––Don't be so hard on yourself, replied Elizabeth.</t4612>
<t4613>––There are no considerations that matter in such great evils.</t4613> <t4614>Human nature is too prone to resort to them.</t4614> <t4615>No, Lizzy; let me realize once in my life how badly I have acted.</t4615> <t4616>I'm not going to die from the shock; it will pass quite soon.</t4616>
<t4617>––Do you think they are in London?</t4617>
<t4618>––Yes; where else could they be so well hidden?</t4618>
<t4619>––And Lydia always wanted so much to go to London! ––added Catherine.</t4619>
<t4620>––Then he must be happy ––said his father coldly–– and he won't leave there for a long time.</t4620> <t4621>After a short silence, he continued:</t4621>
<t4622>Lizzy, don't hold a grudge against me for not having followed your advice last May; what happened shows that you were right.</t4622>
<t4623>At that moment, they were interrupted by Jane, who came to get the tea for her mother.</t4623>
<t4624>––"Look how nice!" exclaimed Mr. Bennet.</t4624> <t4625>"That lends a certain elegance to misfortune!"</t4625> <t4626>"Another day I will do the same: I will stay in the library with my nightcap and dressing gown and give you all the trouble I can, or perhaps I will leave it for when Catherine runs away..."</t4626>
<t4627>––I'm not going to run away, Dad! ––shouted Catherine furiously––.</t4627> <t4628>If I had gone to Brighton, I would have behaved better than Lydia.</t4628>
<t4629>––You to Brighton!</t4629> <t4630>I wouldn't trust you even if you were just going to the corner!</t4630> <t4631>No, Catherine.</t4631> <t4632>I've finally learned to be cautious, and you will regret it.</t4632> <t4633>No officer will enter this house again, even if just passing through.</t4633> <t4634>Dances will be absolutely prohibited unless one of your sisters accompanies you, and you will never go out even to the door of the house without proving that you have spent ten minutes of the day in a reasonable manner.</t4634>
<t4635>Catherine took all these threats seriously and began to cry.</t4635>
<t4636>––Well, well ––said Mr. Bennet––, don't get upset.</t4636> <t4637>If you are a good girl for the next ten years, as soon as they pass, I will take you to see a parade.</t4637>
<t4638>CHAPTER XLIX</t4638>
<t4639>Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, while Jane and Elizabeth were walking together through the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them.</t4639> <t4640>They thought she was coming to call them on behalf of their mother and ran to meet her; but the woman said to Jane: Excuse me for interrupting you, miss; but I assumed you might have some good news from the capital and therefore took the liberty of coming to ask you about it.</t4640>
<t4641>––What do you say, Hill?</t4641> <t4642>I haven't heard anything.</t4642>
<t4643>––Dear miss! ––exclaimed Mrs. Hill with great astonishment––.</t4643> <t4644>Do you not know that a messenger has arrived for the master, sent by Mr. Gardiner?</t4644> <t4645>He has been here for half an hour and the master has received a letter.</t4645>
<t4646>The two girls rushed towards the house, too anxious to continue their conversation.</t4646> <t4647>They went from the hall to the dining room and from there to the library, but their father was not in any of those places; they were about to check if he was upstairs with their mother when they ran into the butler who told them:</t4647>
<t4648>––If you are looking for my master, ladies, you will find him strolling through the grove.</t4648>
<t4649>Jane and Elizabeth crossed the hall again and, crossing the lawn, ran after their father who was heading towards a small grove beside the fence.</t4649>
<t4650>Jane, who was neither as light nor had the habit of running like Elizabeth, fell behind, while her sister arrived breathlessly to their father and exclaimed:</t4650>
<t4651>––What news is there, Dad?</t4651> <t4652>What news is there? Have you heard anything about my uncle?</t4652>
<t4653>––Yes, he has sent me a letter by a messenger.</t4653>
<t4654>––And what news do you bring, good or bad?</t4654>
<t4655>––What good can be expected? ––said the father, taking the letter out of his pocket––.</t4655> <t4656>Here, read it if you want.</t4656>
<t4657>Elizabeth grabbed the letter impatiently.</t4657> <t4658>Jane arrived then.</t4658>
<t4659>––Read it aloud ––Mr. Bennet requested––, because I still don't know what it's about.</t4659>
<t4660>Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.</t4660>
<t4661>My dear brother,</t4661>
<t4662>At last, I can send you news about my niece, and such news, overall, that I hope will satisfy you.</t4662> <t4663>Shortly after you left on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out where in London they were.</t4663> <t4664>I will reserve the details for when we see each other; suffice it to know that they have been discovered; I have seen both of them.</t4664>
<t4665>Then it is what I have always hoped for, exclaimed Jane––.</t4665> <t4666>They are married!</t4666>
<t4667>Elizabeth continued reading:</t4667>
<t4668>They are not married nor do I believe they intend to be, but if you want to fulfill the commitments I have taken the liberty to make in your name, it won't be long before they are.</t4668> <t4669>All you have to do is secure for your daughter, as a dowry, her equal share of the five thousand pounds that your daughters will receive upon your death and that of your wife, and promise to give her one hundred pounds annually while you live.</t4669> <t4670>These are the conditions that, upon careful consideration, I have not hesitated to accept on your behalf, as I believed I was authorized to do so.</t4670> <t4671>I am sending you this by special messenger, as there is no time to lose for you to give me a response.</t4671> <t4672>You will easily understand from all the details that Mr. Wickham's situation is not as desperate as has been believed.</t4672> <t4673>People have been mistaken, and I am pleased to affirm that after all debts are paid, there will still be some money left to endow my niece as an addition to her own fortune.</t4673> <t4674>If, as I hope, you send me full powers to act on your behalf in this matter, I will immediately instruct Haggerston to draft the appropriate document.</t4674> <t4675>There is no need for you to return to the capital; therefore, stay calm in Longbourn and trust in my diligence and care.</t4675> <t4676>Answer me as soon as possible and try to write clearly.</t4676> <t4677>We have thought it best for my niece to leave my house to get married, which I have no doubt you will approve.</t4677> <t4678>She is coming today.</t4678> <t4679>I will write to you again as soon as there is any news.</t4679>
<t4680>Yours,</t4680>
<t4681>E. Gardiner.</t4681>
<t4682>––Is it possible? ––exclaimed Elizabeth upon finishing the letter––.</t4682> <t4683>Could it be possible that he will marry her?</t4683>
<t4684>––Then Wickham is not as despicable as we thought ––observed Jane––.</t4684> <t4685>Dear father, I congratulate you.</t4685>
<t4686>––Have you already answered the letter?</t4686>
<t4687>––No, but it must be done immediately.</t4687>
<t4688>Elizabeth vehemently begged him not to delay it.</t4688>
<t4689>––Dear Dad, come home and start writing immediately.</t4689> <t4690>Think about how important the minutes are at this moment.</t4690>
<t4691>––Let me write for you ––said Jane––, if you don't want to bother.</t4691>
<t4692>––It bothers me a lot ––he replied––, but there's no other choice.</t4692>
<t4693>And he returned with them to the house.</t4693>
<t4694>––I suppose you will accept, added Elizabeth.</t4694>
<t4695>––Accept! I'm embarrassed that you ask for so little!</t4695>
<t4696>––They must get married!</t4696> <t4697>Even though he is the way he is.</t4697>
<t4698>––Yes, yes, they must get married.</t4698> <t4699>There is no other option.</t4699> <t4700>But there are two points I want to clarify: first, how much money your uncle has advanced to resolve this, and second, how I am going to pay him back.</t4700>
<t4701>––Money, my uncle? ––asked Jane––.</t4701> <t4702>What do you mean?</t4702>
<t4703>––I say that no man in his right mind would marry Lydia for such a slight temptation as one hundred pounds annually during my life and fifty when I die.</t4703>
<t4704>––It is very true ––said Elizabeth––; it hadn't occurred to me.</t4704> <t4705>Paid off his debts and still something left!</t4705> <t4706>That must be my uncle's doing.</t4706> <t4707>What a good and generous man!</t4707> <t4708>I fear he is in trouble, for with a small amount, you can't do all that.</t4708>
<t4709>––No ––said Mr. Bennet––, Wickham is a fool if he accepts Lydia for less than ten thousand pounds.</t4709> <t4710>I would regret judging him so poorly when we are about to become relatives.</t4710>
<t4711>––Ten thousand pounds! God forbid!</t4711> <t4712>When could we ever pay half of that amount?</t4712>
<t4713>Mr. Bennet did not reply, and, absorbed in their thoughts, they continued in silence until they reached the house.</t4713> <t4714>The father went into the library to write, and the girls went to the dining room.</t4714>
<t4715>––Are they really going to get married? ––exclaimed Elizabeth as soon as they were alone––.</t4715><t4716>How strange!</t4716> <t4717>And we shall have to give thanks yet.</t4717> <t4718>Despite the slim chances of happiness in that marriage and Wickham's perfidy, we will still have to rejoice.</t4718> <t4719>Oh, Lydia!</t4719>
<t4720>––I console myself by thinking ––replied Jane–– that he surely wouldn't marry Lydia if he didn't love her.</t4720> <t4721>Although our kind uncle may have done something to save him, I can't believe he advanced ten thousand pounds or anything like that.</t4721> <t4722>He has children and may have more.</t4722> <t4723>He wouldn't be able to save even half of that amount.</t4723>
<t4724>––If we could find out how much Wickham's debts amount to ––said Elizabeth–– and what dowry Uncle Gardiner is giving our sister, we would know exactly what he has done for them, since Wickham doesn't have a single shilling.</t4724> <t4725>We will never be able to repay Uncle's kindness.</t4725> <t4726>Taking her into his home and placing her under his personal care and protection is a sacrifice we can never thank him enough for.</t4726> <t4727>He must be with them now.</t4727> <t4728>If such kindness doesn't make her feel miserable, she will never deserve to be happy.</t4728> <t4729>What a shame for her to face our aunt!</t4729>
<t4730>––We must all try to forget what happened ––said Jane––: I hope they will still be happy.</t4730> <t4731>In my view, the fact that Wickham has agreed to marry is proof that he has taken the right path.</t4731> <t4732>Their mutual affection will make them settle down, and I trust it will make them so reasonable that, in time, they will make us forget their past imprudence:</t4732>
<t4733>––They have behaved in such a way ––replied Elizabeth–– that neither you, nor I, nor anyone will ever be able to forget it.</t4733> <t4734>It's useless to talk about it.</t4734>
<t4735>It then occurred to the girls that their mother was completely unaware of all this.</t4735> <t4736>They went to the library and asked their father if he wanted them to tell her.</t4736> <t4737>Mr. Bennet was writing and, without raising his head, replied coldly:</t4737>
<t4738>––As you wish.</t4738>
<t4739>––Can we show him Uncle Gardiner's letter?</t4739>
<t4740>––Teach him whatever you want and leave.</t4740>
<t4741>Elizabeth picked up the letter from the desk and the two sisters went up to their mother's room.</t4741> <t4742>Mary and Catherine were with Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, they had to find out as well.</t4742> <t4743>After a slight preparation for the good news, the letter was read aloud.</t4743> <t4744>Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself, and as soon as Jane reached Mr. Gardiner's hopes that Lydia would soon be married, her joy burst forth, and every subsequent phrase increased it.</t4744> <t4745>The jubilation now produced an exaltation in her that anguish and sorrow had not caused.</t4745> <t4746>The main thing was that her daughter would get married; the fear that she might not be happy did not concern her in the least, nor did it humiliate her to think of her bad behavior.</t4746>
<t4747>––My dear, my beloved Lydia! ––he exclaimed––.</t4747> <t4748>It's wonderful!</t4748> <t4749>She will get married!</t4749> <t4750>I will see her again!</t4750> <t4751>Married at sixteen!</t4751> <t4752>Oh, how good and loving you are, my brother!</t4752> <t4753>I knew it would be like this, that everything would be sorted out!</t4753> <t4754>How eager I am to see her, and also dear Wickham! But, what about the dresses?</t4754> <t4755>And the wedding dress?</t4755> <t4756>I will write to my sister-in-law about that right now.</t4756> <t4757>Lizzy, my dear, run to see your father and ask him how much he is going to give.</t4757> <t4758>Wait, wait, I will go myself.</t4758> <t4759>Ring the bell, Catherine, so Hill can come.</t4759> <t4760>I will get dressed in a moment.</t4760> <t4761>My dear, my Lydia of my soul!</t4761> <t4762>How happy we will both be when we see each other!</t4762>
<t4763>The older sister tried to moderate the violence of her excitement a little and to make her mother think about the obligations that Mr. Gardiner's behavior imposed on all of them.</t4763>
<t4764>––Well, we must attribute this happy outcome, he added–– to his generosity.</t4764> <t4765>We are convinced that he has helped Wickham with his money.</t4765>
<t4766>––Well ––exclaimed the mother––, it is very natural.</t4766> <t4767>Who else would have done it, but your uncle?</t4767> <t4768>If he hadn't had children, we would have inherited his fortune, you know, and this is the first time he has done something for us, apart from a few gifts.</t4768> <t4769>How happy I am!</t4769> <t4770>Soon I will have a married daughter: Mrs. Wickham!</t4770> <t4771>How well that sounds!</t4771> <t4772>And she just turned sixteen last June.</t4772> <t4773>Dear Jane, I am so excited that I won't be able to write; so I will dictate and you will write for me.</t4773> <t4774>Then we will determine with your father what to do about the money, but the other things must be arranged right now.</t4774>
<t4775>She was about to deal with all the particulars about silks, muslins, and batistes, and would have immediately given some orders if Jane had not convinced her, though with some difficulty, that she should first consult her husband.</t4775> <t4776>She made her understand that a day's delay would not have the slightest importance, and Mrs. Bennet was too happy to be as obstinate as always.</t4776> <t4777>Besides, other plans had already occurred to her:</t4777>
<t4778>––I will go to Meryton as soon as I get dressed, to share such excellent news with my sister Philips.</t4778> <t4779>And on the way back I can visit Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long.</t4779> <t4780>Catherine, run downstairs and call for the carriage!</t4780> <t4781>I am sure that getting some fresh air will do me good.</t4781> <t4782>Girls, do you need anything from Meryton? Oh, here comes Hill.</t4782> <t4783>Dear Hill, have you heard the good news yet?</t4783> <t4784>Miss Lydia is going to get married, and to toast her wedding, you will have some punch.</t4784>
<t4785>Mrs. Hill expressed her satisfaction and gave her congratulations to everyone.</t4785> <t4786>Elizabeth, dizzy from all the madness, took refuge in her room to freely indulge her thoughts.</t4786>
<t4787>The situation of poor Lydia was to be, even in the best case, quite bad; but that was not the worst; she had to be grateful, for although looking to the future her sister could not expect any reasonable happiness or any prosperity in the world, looking back, to what only two hours earlier Elizabeth had feared so much, it could not be denied that she had still been lucky.</t4787>
<t4788>CHAPTER L</t4788>
<t4789>Previously, Mr. Bennet had often wanted to save a certain annual amount to improve the fortune of his daughters and his wife, if she survived him, instead of spending all his income.</t4789> <t4790>And now he regretted not having done so.</t4790> <t4791>This would have prevented Lydia from indebting herself to her uncle for everything he now had to do for her, both in terms of honor and money.</t4791> <t4792>Moreover, he could have had the pleasure of tempting any of the brightest young men in Great Britain to marry her.</t4792>
<t4793>He was seriously dismayed that for a matter which offered so few advantages for anyone, his brother-in-law had to make so many sacrifices, and he wanted to find out the amount of his donation in order to repay him when possible.</t4793>
<t4794>In the early days of Mr. Bennet's marriage, it was considered that there was no need for economy, as it was assumed that a male heir would be born and that he would inherit the estate upon reaching the appropriate age, thus ensuring the widow and daughters would be provided for.</t4794> <t4795>But five daughters were born in succession, and the male heir did not appear.</t4795> <t4796>Years after Lydia's birth, Mrs. Bennet still believed that the heir would come, but eventually, she gave up hope.</t4796> <t4797>Now it was too late to save: Mrs. Bennet had no aptitude for economy, and her husband's love of independence was the only thing that prevented them from overspending.</t4797>
<t4798>In the marriage settlements, five thousand pounds were secured for Mrs. Bennet and her daughters; but the distribution depended on the will of the parents.</t4798> <t4799>Finally, this point was to be decided concerning Lydia, and Mr. Bennet did not hesitate to agree to the proposal.</t4799> <t4800>In terms of gratitude for his brother-in-law's kindness, though expressed very concisely, he entrusted to paper his approval of everything done and his desire to fulfill the commitments made in his name.</t4800> <t4801>He would never have believed that Wickham would consent to marry Lydia at the cost of so few inconveniences as those resulting from that arrangement.</t4801> <t4802>Ten pounds annually was the most he was going to lose by giving the hundred he had to give them, for between the fixed ordinary expenses, the loose money he gave Lydia, and the continuous cash gifts her mother made to her, little less than that amount was spent on Lydia.</t4802>
<t4803>Another thing that pleasantly surprised him was that everything was done with such insignificant trouble for him, as his main desire was always to be left alone.</t4803> <t4804>After the initial burst of anger that motivated him to seek out his daughter, he returned, as expected, to his usual indolence.</t4804> <t4805>He quickly dispatched the letter, though he took a long time to start things, he was quick to execute them.</t4805> <t4806>In the letter, he asked for more details about what he owed his brother-in-law, but he was too resentful towards Lydia to send her any message.</t4806>
<t4807>The good news spread quickly throughout the house and, with proportional promptness, through the neighborhood.</t4807> <t4808>It is true that it would have caused more talk if Lydia Bennet had come to town, and it would have been even better if they had confined her to some distant farm; but there was already enough to gossip about regarding her marriage, and the well-intentioned wishes for her happiness that the spiteful old women of Meryton had previously expressed lost only a little of their liveliness in this change of circumstances, for with such a husband Lydia's misfortune was considered certain.</t4808>
<t4809>It had been fifteen days since Mrs. Bennet had come down from her rooms, but in order to celebrate such joyous events, she once again took her radiant place at the head of the table.</t4809> <t4810>In her triumph, there was not the slightest feeling of shame.</t4810> <t4811>The marriage of a daughter, which had been her main desire since Jane turned sixteen, was now about to take place.</t4811> <t4812>She thought and spoke of nothing but elegant weddings, fine muslins, new servants, and new carriages.</t4812> <t4813>She was very busy looking for a suitable house for the couple in the neighborhood, and without knowing or considering what their income would be, she rejected many for lack of space or luxury.</t4813>
<t4814>––Haye Park ––he said–– would do very well if the Gouldings would let it; or the house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Asworth is too far away!</t4814> <t4815>I could not bear to have her live ten miles away.</t4815> <t4816>As for Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.</t4816>
<t4817>Her husband let her speak without interrupting her while the servants were present.</t4817> <t4818>But when they left, he said to her:</t4818>
<t4819>––Mrs. Bennet, before taking any of those houses or all of them for your daughter, let's make things clear.</t4819> <t4820>There is a house in this neighborhood where they will never be admitted.</t4820> <t4821>I will not encourage the impudence of either of them by receiving them at Longbourn.</t4821>
<t4822>This declaration was followed by a long dispute, but Mr. Bennet remained firm.</t4822> <t4823>The discussion moved from this point to another, and Mrs. Bennet watched with astonishment and horror as her husband refused to advance even a guinea to buy their daughter’s wedding dress.</t4823> <t4824>He assured that she would not receive any proof of affection from him regarding that matter.</t4824> <t4825>Mrs. Bennet could not comprehend it; it was beyond the possibilities of her imagination that her husband's resentment could reach the point of denying their daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid.</t4825> <t4826>She was more sensitive to the misfortune of her daughter not having a wedding dress to wear than to the shame of her having eloped and lived with Wickham for fifteen days before the wedding took place.</t4826>
<t4827>Elizabeth regretted more than ever having informed Darcy, driven by the pain of the moment, of her sister's action, for since the wedding was going to cover the scandal of the elopement, it was to be assumed that the ungrateful preliminaries would be hidden from all those who could be unaware of them.</t4827>
<t4828>He did not fear Darcy's indiscretion; few people inspired more confidence in him than Darcy; but it mortified him that he knew his sister's weakness.</t4828> <t4829>And not out of fear that it would cause her any harm, because the chasm that seemed to separate them was insurmountable anyway.</t4829> <t4830>Even if Lydia's marriage had been arranged in the most honorable way, it could not be supposed that Darcy would want to ally himself with a family that, to all its other drawbacks, would now add the most intimate connection with the man whom Darcy so justly despised.</t4830>
<t4831>In the face of such a thing, it was natural for Darcy to retreat.</t4831> <t4832>The desire to win Elizabeth's affection, which she had sensed in him in Derbyshire, could not survive such a blow.</t4832> <t4833>Elizabeth felt humiliated, saddened, and filled with vague remorse.</t4833> <t4834>She longed for his affection when she could no longer hope to obtain it.</t4834> <t4835>She wanted to hear from him when there was not the slightest chance of receiving news from him.</t4835> <t4836>She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was likely that they would not see each other again.</t4836>
<t4837>"What a triumph for him," she thought, "if he knew that the proposals I so proudly rejected just four months ago, I would now gladly accept."</t4837>
<t4838>He did not doubt that he was as generous as anyone, but as long as he lived, that had to be a triumph for him.</t4838>
<t4839>Then she began to understand that Darcy was exactly, by his way of being and his talent, the man who would have suited her best.</t4839> <t4840>Darcy's understanding and character, although not similar to hers, would have fulfilled all her desires.</t4840> <t4841>Their union would have been advantageous for both: with her ease and liveliness, his temperament would have softened and his manners would have improved.</t4841> <t4842>And the judgment, culture, and knowledge of the world that he possessed would have brought her significant benefits.</t4842>
<t4843>But that ideal marriage could no longer teach the admiring crowds what conjugal happiness was; the union that was about to take place in Elizabeth's family was very different and excluded the possibility of the former.</t4843>
<t4844>They could not imagine how Wickham and Lydia would manage to live with a passable independence; but it was not difficult to conjecture how unstable the happiness of a couple united solely because their passions were stronger than their virtue would be.</t4844>
<t4845>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote back to his brother-in-law.</t4845> <t4846>He briefly responded to Mr. Bennet's gratitude by saying that his greatest wish was to contribute to the well-being of the entire family and concluded by asking that the matter not be discussed any further.</t4846> <t4847>The main purpose of the letter was to inform him that Wickham had decided to leave the regiment.</t4847>
<t4848>He was very eager for him to do it ––he added when we finalized the marriage; and I believe you will agree with me that his departure from that Corps is highly beneficial both for him and for my niece.</t4848> <t4849>Mr. Wickham's intention is to join the regular Army, and among his old friends, there are those who can and want to help him achieve it.</t4849> <t4850>He has been promised the rank of ensign in General X's regiment, currently stationed in the North.</t4850> <t4851>It is much better for him to move away from this part of the kingdom.</t4851> <t4852>He firmly promises, and I hope it will be so, that being among other people before whom they should not discredit themselves, the two will be more prudent.</t4852> <t4853>I have written to Colonel Forster informing him of our arrangements and requesting that he tell Mr. Wickham's various creditors in Brighton and its surroundings that they will be paid immediately under my responsibility.</t4853> <t4854>Would you mind taking the trouble to give the same assurances to the creditors in Meryton, of whom I am sending you a list according to what Mr. Wickham has indicated to me?</t4854> <t4855>He has confessed all his debts to us and I hope that at least in this he has not deceived us.</t4855> <t4856>Haggerston already has instructions and within a week everything will be ready.</t4856> <t4857>Then Mr. Wickham will join his regiment, unless he is first invited to go to Longbourn, for my wife tells me that Lydia is very eager to see you all before leaving the South.</t4857> <t4858>She is very well and humbly asks you and her mother to remember her.</t4858>
<t4859>Yours,</t4859>
<t4860>E. Gardiner.</t4860>
<t4861>Mr. Bennet and his daughters understood the advantages of Wickham leaving the county garrison as clearly as Mr. Gardiner; but Mrs. Bennet was not as satisfied as they were.</t4861> <t4862>She was very displeased that Lydia was to settle in the North precisely when she had been looking forward with pleasure and pride to enjoying her company, for she had not given up her illusion that Lydia would reside in Hertfordshire.</t4862> <t4863>And besides, it was a pity that Lydia would be separated from a regiment where everyone knew her and where she had so many admirers.</t4863>
<t4864>––She is so fond of Mrs. Forster that it will be very hard for her to leave her.</t4864> <t4865>And, besides, there are several boys she likes.</t4865> <t4866>It may be that the officers of General X's regiment are not as nice.</t4866>
<t4867>The plea ––for such it had to be considered from his daughter to be readmitted into the family before departing for the North was at first roundly denied; but Jane and Elizabeth, for the sake of their sister's feelings and future, wished that she would notify her parents of her marriage in person, and insisted with such interest, gentleness, and sweetness that Mr. Bennet agreed to receive her and her husband at Longbourn after the wedding, that they convinced him.</t4867> <t4868>Thus, Mrs. Bennet had the satisfaction of knowing that they could present their married daughter to the neighborhood before she was banished to the North.</t4868> <t4869>Consequently, when Mr. Bennet wrote back to his brother-in-law, he gave permission for the couple to come, and it was determined that after the ceremony they would leave for Longbourn.</t4869> <t4870>Elizabeth complained that Wickham accepted this plan, and if she had been guided only by her own desires, Wickham would be the last person she would want to meet.</t4870>
<t4871>CHAPTER LI</t4871>
<t4872>The day of Lydia's wedding arrived, and Jane and Elizabeth were probably more interested in it than she was herself.</t4872> <t4873>The carriage was sent to fetch them from X, and it would return with them at lunchtime.</t4873> <t4874>Jane and Elizabeth dreaded their arrival, especially Jane, who attributed to Lydia the same feelings that would have overwhelmed her if she had been the guilty one, and she tormented herself thinking about what Lydia must be suffering.</t4874>
<t4875>They arrived.</t4875> <t4876>The family was gathered in the sitting room waiting for them.</t4876> <t4877>A smile adorned Mrs. Bennet's face when the carriage stopped in front of the door; her husband was impenetrably serious, and her daughters were alarmed, anxious, and restless.</t4877>
<t4878>The voice of Lydia was heard in the hall; the door opened and the newlywed entered the room.</t4878> <t4879>Her mother stood up, hugged her, and enthusiastically welcomed her, extending her hand to Wickham who followed his wife, wishing them both the greatest happiness, with a promptness that demonstrated her conviction that they would undoubtedly be happy.</t4879>
<t4880>The reception of Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was no longer so cordial.</t4880> <t4881>He reaffirmed his seriousness and barely opened his lips.</t4881> <t4882>The tranquility of the young couple was really enough to provoke him.</t4882> <t4883>Elizabeth was embarrassed and even Jane was scandalized.</t4883> <t4884>Lydia remained Lydia: untamed, shameless, foolish, loud, and daring.</t4884> <t4885>She went from sister to sister asking them to congratulate her, and when they all finally sat down, she looked eagerly around the room, noticing that there had been a small change, and, bursting into laughter, said that it had been a long time since she had been there.</t4885>
<t4886>Wickham did not seem less pleased than she was; but his manners remained so pleasant that if his behavior and his marriage had been as they should, his smiles and his easy gestures in claiming the recognition of his kinship from his sisters-in-law would have charmed them all.</t4886> <t4887>Elizabeth never believed he was capable of such impudence, but she sat determined not to set limits henceforth to the shamelessness of a shameless person.</t4887> <t4888>Both Jane and she were blushing, but the cheeks of those who caused their embarrassment remained unchanged.</t4888>
<t4889>The conversation was not lacking.</t4889> <t4890>The bride and the mother talked without pause, and Wickham, who sat next to Elizabeth, began to ask about their acquaintances in the neighborhood with a cheerfulness and good humor that she could not have matched in her responses.</t4890> <t4891>Both Lydia and Wickham seemed to have wonderful memories.</t4891> <t4892>They remembered everything from the past without any regret, and she willingly spoke of things that her sisters would not have mentioned for anything in the world.</t4892>
<t4893>––It's already been three months since I left! ––she exclaimed––.</t4893> <t4894>And it seems like it was only fifteen days ago!</t4894> <t4895>And yet, how many things have happened!</t4895> <t4896>My God!</t4896> <t4897>When I left, I had no idea that when I returned I would be married; although I thought it would be hilarious if that were the case.</t4897>
<t4898>Her father raised his eyes; Jane was distressed; Elizabeth looked at Lydia significantly, but she, who never saw or heard what did not interest her, continued cheerfully:</t4898>
<t4899>––Mom, do the people around here know that I got married?</t4899> <t4900>I was afraid they didn't, and that's why, when we passed William Goulding's carriage, I wanted him to find out; I lowered the window on his side, took off my glove, and rested my hand on the window frame so he could see the ring.</t4900> <t4901>Then I greeted him and smiled as if nothing had happened.</t4901>
<t4902>Elizabeth couldn't take it anymore.</t4902> <t4903>She got up and went to her room and didn't come down until she heard them passing through the hall towards the dining room.</t4903> <t4904>She arrived in time to see Lydia, strutting, taking her place at the table on their mother's right side and saying to her older sister:</t4904>
<t4905>––Jane, now it is my turn to take your place.</t4905> <t4906>You move to second place, because I am a married woman.</t4906>
<t4907>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that composure which she had always lacked.</t4907> <t4908>Her peace of mind and her ease were increasing.</t4908> <t4909>She was eager to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all the other neighbors, to hear them call her "Mrs. Wickham."</t4909> <t4910>Meanwhile, after lunch, she went to show her wedding ring to Mrs. Hill and the two maids to boast about being married.</t4910>
<t4911>––Well, Mom ––she said when everyone returned to the sitting room––, what do you think of my husband?</t4911> <t4912>Isn't he charming?</t4912> <t4913>I'm sure all my sisters envy me; I only wish they have half the luck I do.</t4913> <t4914>They should go to Brighton; it's an ideal place to find a husband.</t4914> <t4915>What a pity we all didn't go!</t4915>
<t4916>––It's true.</t4916> <t4917>If I were in charge, we would have gone.</t4917> <t4918>Lydia, my dear, I don't like it at all that you are going so far away.</t4918> <t4919>Does it have to be this way?</t4919>
<t4920>––Oh, Lord!</t4920> <t4921>Yes, there is no other choice.</t4921> <t4922>But I will like it a lot.</t4922> <t4923>You, dad, and my sisters have to come see us.</t4923> <t4924>We will be in Newcastle all winter, and there will surely be some dances; I will try to get good partners for everyone.</t4924>
<t4925>––That's what I would like the most! ––sighed her mother.</t4925>
<t4926>––And when you return, let one or two of my sisters stay with us, and I am sure I will have found them a husband before the winter is over:</t4926>
<t4927>––I appreciate the intention ––replied Elizabeth––, but I don't quite like, to say the least, your way of getting a husband.</t4927>
<t4928>The guests were going to stay at Longbourn for only ten days.</t4928> <t4929>Wickham had received his assignment before leaving London and had to join his regiment within a fortnight.</t4929>
<t4930>Nobody, except Mrs. Bennet, felt that their stay was too short.</t4930> <t4931>Most of the time was spent making visits accompanied by her daughter and organizing parties at the house.</t4931> <t4932>The parties were pleasant for everyone; avoiding the family circle was even more desirable for those who thought than for those who did not think.</t4932>
<t4933>Wickham's affection for Lydia was exactly as Elizabeth had imagined it, and very different from Lydia's affection for him.</t4933> <t4934>Elizabeth needed only to observe her sister a little to realize that the elopement had been driven more by Lydia's love for him than by his love for her.</t4934> <t4935>She would have been surprised that Wickham had eloped with a woman towards whom he felt no special attraction, if she had not been certain that his dire situation had forced that action upon him, and he was not the kind of man, in such a case, to pass up the opportunity of having a companion.</t4935>
<t4936>Lydia was crazy about him; her "dear Wickham" was always on her lips, he was the most perfect man in the world and everything he did was well done.</t4936> <t4937>She assured that at the beginning of September Wickham would kill more birds than anyone in the region.</t4937>
<t4938>One morning, shortly after her arrival, while she was sitting with her older sisters, Lydia said to Elizabeth:</t4938>
<t4939>––I don't think I've told you yet how my wedding was.</t4939> <t4940>You weren't there when I explained it to mom and the others.</t4940> <t4941>Aren't you interested in knowing?</t4941>
<t4942>––Really, no ––replied Elizabeth––; you shouldn't talk much about that matter.</t4942>
<t4943>––Oh, how strange you are!</t4943> <t4944>But I want to tell you about it.</t4944> <t4945>You already know that we got married in San Clemente because Wickham's lodging belonged to that parish.</t4945> <t4946>We had agreed to all be there at eleven.</t4946> <t4947>My uncles and I had to go together and meet the others at the church.</t4947> <t4948>Well, Monday morning arrived and I was beside myself.</t4948> <t4949>You know?</t4949> <t4950>I was so afraid that something would happen to ruin everything, I would have gone crazy!</t4950> <t4951>While I was getting dressed, my aunt kept preaching to me non-stop as if she were reading me a sermon.</t4951> <t4952>But I didn't hear even a tenth of her words because, as you can imagine, I was thinking about my dear Wickham, and whether he would wear his blue suit for the wedding.</t4952>
<t4953>"Well, we had breakfast at ten, as usual."</t4953> <t4954>"I thought it would never end, because you should know that my uncles were extremely annoying with me the whole time I spent with them."</t4954> <t4955>"Believe me, I didn't set foot outside the house in fifteen days; no parties, no excursions, nothing!"</t4955> <t4956>"The truth is that London wasn't very lively; but the Little Theatre was open."</t4956> <t4957>"As soon as the car arrived at the door, my uncle had to attend to that horrible Mr. Stone for some matter."</t4957> <t4958>"And you know that as soon as they meet, it takes a long time."</t4958> <t4959>"Well, I was so scared that I didn't know what to do, because my uncle was going to be the best man, and if we arrived late, we wouldn't be able to get married that day."</t4959> <t4960>"But fortunately, my uncle was ready in two minutes and we left for the church."</t4960> <t4961>"But then I remembered that if Uncle Gardiner hadn't been able to go to the wedding, it wouldn't have been canceled anyway, because Mr. Darcy could have taken his place."</t4961>
<t4962>Mr. Darcy! ––repeated Elizabeth in complete astonishment.</t4962>
<t4963>Of course!</t4963> <t4964>He was accompanying Wickham, you know.</t4964> <t4965>But alas, I had forgotten!</t4965> <t4966>I shouldn't have said it.</t4966> <t4967>I promised faithfully.</t4967> <t4968>What will Wickham say? It was a secret!</t4968>
<t4969>––If it was a secret ––said Jane–– don't say another word.</t4969> <t4970>I don't want to know.</t4970>
<t4971>––Naturally ––added Elizabeth, even though she was dying of curiosity––, we won't ask you anything.</t4971>
<t4972>––Thank you ––said Lydia––, because if you asked me, I would tell you everything and Wickham would get angry.</t4972>
<t4973>With such an incentive to coax him, Elizabeth refrained from doing so and to avoid the temptation, she left.</t4973>
<t4974>But ignoring that was impossible or, at the very least, it was impossible not to try to find out.</t4974> <t4975>Darcy had attended Lydia's wedding.</t4975> <t4976>Both the event and its protagonists seemed precisely the least likely for Darcy to get involved with them.</t4976> <t4977>Quick and confused conjectures about what that meant crossed her mind, but none seemed acceptable to her.</t4977> <t4978>The ones that pleased her the most, because they exalted Darcy, were apparently improbable.</t4978> <t4979>She could not bear such uncertainty, so she hurried and grabbed a sheet of paper to write a brief letter to her aunt asking her to clarify what Lydia had let slip, if it was compatible with the secrecy of the matter.</t4979>
<t4980>"You will understand," he added, "that I need to know why a person who has nothing to do with us and who, properly speaking, is a stranger to our family, was with you at that moment."</t4980> <t4981>"I beg you to reply by return mail and explain it to me, unless there are powerful reasons that impose the secrecy Lydia mentions, in which case I will have to try to resign myself to ignorance."</t4981>
<t4982>“But I will not do it,” she said to herself upon finishing the letter; “and dear aunt, if you do not tell me, I will be forced to resort to tricks and stratagems to find out.”</t4982>
<t4983>Jane's delicate sense of honor prevented her from speaking alone with Elizabeth about what had slipped out to Lydia.</t4983> <t4984>Elizabeth was glad, although in this way, if her inquiries were successful, she would not be able to have a confidant.</t4984>
<t4985>CHAPTER LII</t4985>
<t4986>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an immediate response to her letter.</t4986> <t4987>She ran with it to the grove, where there was less chance of being disturbed, sat on a bench, and prepared to be happy, as the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a refusal.</t4987>
<t4988>Gracechurch Street, September 8.</t4988>
<t4989>My dear niece: I have just received your letter and I am going to dedicate the whole morning to answering it, as I believe that in a few words I will not be able to tell you all that I have to share with you.</t4989> <t4990>I must confess that your question surprised me, as I did not expect it from you.</t4990> <t4991>Do not be upset, I only wish you to know that I did not think such clarifications were necessary on your part.</t4991> <t4992>If you do not want to understand me, forgive my impertinence.</t4992> <t4993>Your uncle is as surprised as I am, and only because of the belief that you are an interested party has he allowed himself to act as he has.</t4993> <t4994>But in case you are indeed innocent and know nothing at all, I will have to be more explicit.</t4994>
<t4995>The same day I arrived from Longbourn, your uncle had a very unexpected visit.</t4995> <t4996>Mr. Darcy came and was locked up with him for several hours.</t4996> <t4997>When I returned, everything was already settled; so my curiosity did not suffer as much as yours.</t4997> <t4998>Darcy came to tell Gardiner that he had discovered the hiding place of Wickham and your sister, and that he had seen and spoken to both of them: to Wickham several times, to your sister only once.</t4998> <t4999>From what I can deduce, Darcy left Derbyshire the day after we did and came to London with the idea of finding them.</t4999> <t5000>The reason he gave is that he felt guilty for not having made Wickham's infamy sufficiently known to prevent a decent girl from loving or trusting him.</t5000> <t5001>He generously attributed it all to his blind pride, saying that he had previously deemed it unworthy of him to publish his private affairs.</t5001> <t5002>His conduct would speak for him.</t5002> <t5003>Therefore, he believed it his duty to intervene and remedy a wrong that he himself had caused.</t5003> <t5004>If he had another motive, I am sure it was not dishonorable...</t5004> <t5005>He had spent several days in the capital without being able to find them, but he had a lead that could guide him and that was more important than all of ours and that, moreover, was another reason that prompted him to come see us.</t5005>
<t5006>It seems that there is a lady, a certain Mrs. Younge, who some time ago was Miss Darcy's governess, and had to be dismissed from her position for some reprehensible reason that he did not tell us.</t5006> <t5007>Upon leaving the Darcy family, Mrs. Younge took a large house on Edwards Street and since then made a living by renting out rooms.</t5007> <t5008>Darcy knew that this Mrs. Younge had close ties with Wickham, and he went to her for news of him as soon as he arrived in the capital.</t5008> <t5009>But two or three days went by without being able to obtain from that lady what he needed.</t5009> <t5010>I suppose she did not want to speak until she was bribed, for, in reality, she knew from the beginning where her friend was.</t5010> <t5011>Wickham, in fact, went to her upon his arrival in London, and if there had been room in her house, he would have stayed there.</t5011> <t5012>But, finally, our good friend obtained the address he was looking for.</t5012> <t5013>They were on X Street. He saw Wickham and then wanted to see Lydia.</t5013> <t5014>He confessed to us that his first intention was to convince her to leave that unfortunate situation and return to her family's bosom if it could be arranged for them to receive her, and he offered his help in everything within his reach.</t5014> <t5015>But he found Lydia absolutely determined to stay as she was.</t5015> <t5016>She did not care a bit about her family and rejected Darcy's help; she did not want to hear about leaving Wickham; she was convinced that they would marry someday and did not care when.</t5016> <t5017>In view of this, Darcy thought that the only thing to do was to facilitate and secure the marriage; in his first dialogue with Wickham, he saw that marriage was not in his plans.</t5017> <t5018>Wickham confessed that he had been forced to leave the regiment due to certain pressing debts of honor; he had no scruples in blaming Lydia's madness for all the unfortunate consequences of the elopement.</t5018> <t5019>He said he would immediately resign from his position, and as for the future, he did not know what would become of him; he had to go somewhere, but he did not know where and admitted that he did not have a penny to his name.</t5019>
<t5020>Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister on the spot.</t5020> <t5021>Although Mr. Bennet might not be very wealthy, he could do something for him and his situation would improve with the marriage.</t5021> <t5022>But from Wickham's response, Darcy understood that he still harbored the hope of securing a more solid fortune by marrying another girl in some other country; nevertheless, given the circumstances he was in, he did not seem very averse to the temptation of obtaining an immediate solution.</t5022>
<t5023>They met repeatedly because there were many things to discuss.</t5023> <t5024>Wickham, of course, needed much more than could be given to him, but in the end, he agreed to be reasonable.</t5024>
<t5025>When everything was agreed upon between them, the first thing Mr. Darcy did was inform your uncle, for which he came to Gracechurch Street for the first time, the afternoon before my arrival.</t5025> <t5026>But he could not see Gardiner.</t5026> <t5027>Darcy found out that your father was still at our house, but that he was going to leave the next day.</t5027> <t5028>He did not believe that your father was a more suitable person than your uncle to handle the matter, and then postponed his visit until your father had left.</t5028> <t5029>He did not leave his name, and the next day we only knew that a gentleman had come on a business matter.</t5029>
<t5030>He returned on Saturday.</t5030> <t5031>Your father had left and your uncle was at home.</t5031> <t5032>As I said before, the two of them talked for a long time.</t5032>
<t5033>On Sunday they met again and then I saw him too.</t5033> <t5034>It wasn't until Monday that everything was decided, and then it was when the messenger was sent to Longbourn.</t5034> <t5035>But our visitor was very stubborn; I assure you, Elizabeth, that stubbornness is the true flaw in his character.</t5035> <t5036>He has been accused of many faults on various occasions, but that is the only true one.</t5036> <t5037>He wanted to do everything on his own, despite the fact that your uncle ––and I don't say this for you to thank me, so I beg you not to speak of it–– would have arranged everything instantly.</t5037>
<t5038>They argued for a long time, much longer than the gentleman and the young lady in question deserved.</t5038> <t5039>But in the end, your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of allowing him to be useful to his niece, he reduced him to merely appearing to be so, much to your uncle's displeasure.</t5039> <t5040>So I imagine that your letter this morning has given him great pleasure by providing the opportunity to confess the truth and relinquish the credit that belongs to another.</t5040> <t5041>But I beg you not to disclose this and, at most, only tell Jane.</t5041>
<t5042>I imagine you know what has been done for those young people.</t5042> <t5043>The debts of Wickham, which amount, I believe, to much more than a thousand pounds, have been paid; another thousand has been set aside to increase Lydia's dowry, and he has been secured a job.</t5043> <t5044>According to Darcy, the reasons for doing all this are solely the ones I mentioned before: because of his discretion, it was not known who Wickham was, and he was received and regarded in a way he did not deserve.</t5044> <t5045>There may be some truth in this, although I do not doubt that neither Darcy's discretion nor anyone else's has anything to do with the matter.</t5045> <t5046>But despite his nice words, my dear Elizabeth, you can be sure that your uncle would never have yielded had he not believed himself moved by another interest.</t5046>
<t5047>When everything was resolved, Mr. Darcy returned to his friends who were still at Pemberley, but he promised to return to London for the wedding and to settle the financial arrangements.</t5047>
<t5048>I think I have already told you everything.</t5048> <t5049>If what you say is true, this story will surprise you greatly, but I imagine it will not displease you.</t5049> <t5050>Lydia came to the house and Wickham had constant access to her.</t5050> <t5051>He was the same as I knew him in Hertfordshire, but I wouldn't tell you how much Lydia's behavior during her stay in our house displeased me, if it weren't for Jane's letter on Wednesday that made me understand that upon arriving at Longbourn she behaved exactly the same, so it shouldn't surprise you what I am now telling.</t5051> <t5052>I spoke to her many times with all seriousness, making her see the misfortune she had brought upon her family, but if she heard me it would be by chance, because I am convinced that she didn't even listen to me.</t5052> <t5053>There were times when she irritated me; but I remembered my dear Elizabeth and Jane and clothed myself with patience.</t5053>
<t5054>Mr. Darcy returned punctually and, as Lydia told you, attended the wedding.</t5054> <t5055>He dined with us the next day.</t5055> <t5056>He was planning to leave London on Wednesday or Thursday.</t5056> <t5057>Will you be angry with me, dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity to tell you what I never would have dared to say before, which is how much I like Darcy?</t5057> <t5058>His conduct with us has been as pleasant in every way as when we were in Derbyshire.</t5058> <t5059>His intelligence, his opinions, everything pleases me.</t5059> <t5060>He only lacks a bit of liveliness, and if he marries wisely, his wife will teach him that.</t5060> <t5061>It seems to me that he conceals it very well; he hardly mentioned your name.</t5061> <t5062>But it seems that concealment is in fashion.</t5062>
<t5063>I beg you to forgive me if I have been too suspicious, or at least do not punish me to the point of excluding me from Pemberley.</t5063> <t5064>I will not be completely happy until I have taken a full tour of the estate.</t5064> <t5065>A low phaeton with a good pair of ponies would be ideal.</t5065>
<t5066>I can't write to you anymore.</t5066> <t5067>The children have been calling me for half an hour.</t5067>
<t5068>Yours affectionately,</t5068>
<t5069>M. Gardiner</t5069>
<t5070>The content of this letter left Elizabeth in a state of shock where it was impossible to determine whether pleasure or pain took the greater part.</t5070><t5071>The vague suspicions she had conceived in her uncertainty about Darcy's role in her sister's wedding, without daring to entertain them because they implied acts of kindness too great to be possible, and fearing they were true because of the humiliation that gratitude would impose, were thus confirmed.</t5071><t5072>Darcy had gone after them expressly, had assumed all the trouble and mortification inherent in that search, implored a woman he must detest and was forced to deal with frequently, to persuade and ultimately bribe the man he most wished to avoid and whose very name horrified him to pronounce.</t5072><t5073>He had done it all to save a girl who must mean nothing to him and for whom he could feel no esteem.</t5073><t5074>Elizabeth's heart told her he had done it for her, but other considerations repressed this hope and she soon realized she was flattering her vanity by explaining the fact in this way, for Darcy could not feel any affection for a woman who had rejected him and, if he did, he would not be able to overcome such a natural feeling as that of being related to Wickham.</t5074><t5075>Darcy, Wickham's brother-in-law!</t5075><t5076>The most basic pride had to rebel against that bond.</t5076><t5077>It was true that Darcy had done so much that Elizabeth was confused, but he gave a very plausible reason.</t5077><t5078>It was not unreasonable to think that Darcy believed he had acted wrongly; he was generous and had the means to demonstrate it, and although Elizabeth resisted admitting that she had been the main motive, it was possible to suppose that a remnant of interest in her had contributed to his efforts in a matter that compromised his peace of mind.</t5078><t5079>It was very painful to be so indebted to a person to whom they could never repay what he had done.</t5079><t5080>They owed him Lydia's salvation and reputation.</t5080><t5081>How much Elizabeth was hurt by her ingratitude and the insolent words she had addressed to him!</t5081><t5082>She was ashamed of herself, but proud of him, proud that he had behaved so compassionately and nobly.</t5082><t5083>She read over and over again the praises her aunt bestowed on him, and although they did not seem sufficient, they pleased her.</t5083><t5084>It gave her great pleasure, though it also saddened her to think that her uncles believed that affection and trust still existed between Darcy and her.</t5084>
<t5085>She rose from her seat and came out of her meditation upon noticing someone approaching; and before she could reach another path, Wickham accosted her.</t5085>
<t5086>––I fear I am interrupting your solitary walk, dear sister ––he said as he walked up to her side.</t5086>
<t5087>––That's right, indeed ––he replied with a smile––, but it doesn't mean that the interruption bothers me.</t5087>
<t5088>––I would feel bad bothering you.</t5088> <t5089>We have always been good friends.</t5089> <t5090>And now we are something more.</t5090>
<t5091>––True.</t5091> <t5092>And the others, have they left?</t5092>
<t5093>––I don't know.</t5093> <t5094>Mrs. Bennet and Lydia have gone by carriage to Meryton.</t5094> <t5095>My dear sister, your uncles have told me that you have been to Pemberley.</t5095>
<t5096>Elizabeth answered affirmatively.</t5096>
<t5097>––I envy you that pleasure, and if it were possible, I would pass by there on my way to Newcastle.</t5097> <t5098>I suppose you would have seen the old housekeeper.</t5098> <t5099>Poor Mrs. Reynolds!</t5099> <t5100>How much she loved me!</t5100> <t5101>But I imagine she wouldn't have mentioned me in front of you.</t5101>
<t5102>––Yes, he mentioned you.</t5102>
<t5103>––And what did he say?</t5103>
<t5104>––That you had joined the army and that you were getting into trouble.</t5104> <t5105>You know that at such a distance things get distorted.</t5105>
<t5106>––Sure ––he replied, biting his lips.</t5106>
<t5107>Elizabeth thought she had silenced him, but Wickham immediately said:</t5107>
<t5108>I was surprised to see Darcy last month in the capital.</t5108> <t5109>We met several times.</t5109> <t5110>I would like to know what he was doing in London.</t5110>
<t5111>––He might be preparing for his marriage to Miss de Bourgh ––said Elizabeth––.</t5111> <t5112>It must be something special for him to be in London at this time of year.</t5112>
<t5113>––Undoubtedly.</t5113> <t5114>Did you see him when you were in Lambton?</t5114> <t5115>I think the Gardiners told me that you did.</t5115>
<t5116>––Indeed; he introduced us to his sister.</t5116>
<t5117>––And did you like it?</t5117>
<t5118>––A lot.</t5118>
<t5119>––It is true that I have heard that in the last two years she has improved extraordinarily.</t5119> <t5120>The last time I saw her, she didn't promise much.</t5120> <t5121>I'm glad you liked her.</t5121> <t5122>I hope she does well.</t5122>
<t5123>––He will do well.</t5123> <t5124>He has already passed the most difficult age.</t5124>
<t5125>––Did you pass through the town of Kimpton?</t5125>
<t5126>––I don't remember.</t5126>
<t5127>––I tell you, because that is the rectory that I should have had.</t5127> <t5128>It's a delightful place!</t5128> <t5129>And what an excellent parsonage it has!</t5129> <t5130>It would have suited me from every point of view.</t5130>
<t5131>––Would you have liked to compose sermons?</t5131>
<t5132>––Very much.</t5132> <t5133>I would have taken it as part of my duties and soon it would have cost me no effort.</t5133> <t5134>I cannot complain, but there is no doubt that it would have been the best for me.</t5134> <t5135>The quiet and the retreat of such a life would have fulfilled all my desires.</t5135> <t5136>But it could not be!</t5136> <t5137>Did you hear Darcy mention that topic when you were in Kent?</t5137>
<t5138>––I learned from reliable sources that the parish was bequeathed to you only conditionally and at the will of the current master of Pemberley.</t5138>
<t5139>––Did he tell you that?</t5139> <t5140>Yes, there was something like that; that's how I told you the first time, do you remember?</t5140>
<t5141>––I also heard that there was a time when composing sermons did not seem as pleasant to you as it does now, that you then declared your intention never to be ordained, and that the matter was settled in accordance with your wishes.</t5141>
<t5142>––Yes, it's true.</t5142> <t5143>You must remember what I told you about that when we talked about it the first time.</t5143>
<t5144>She was already almost at the door of the house, for Elizabeth had continued walking to get rid of him.</t5144> <t5145>Out of consideration for her sister, she did not want to provoke him and only said with a smile:</t5145>
<t5146>––Come on, Wickham; we are brothers.</t5146> <t5147>Let's not argue about the past.</t5147> <t5148>I hope that from now on we won't have any reason to argue.</t5148>
<t5149>He shook her hand and he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, although he didn't know what expression to wear, and they entered the house.</t5149>
<t5150>CHAPTER LIII</t5150>
<t5151>Wickham was so chastened by that conversation that he never again exposed himself, nor provoked his dear sister Elizabeth to resume it.</t5151> <t5152>And she was glad to have said enough to ensure that he would not mention the subject again.</t5152>
<t5153>The day of the young couple's departure arrived, and Mrs. Bennet found herself forced into a separation that seemed to be going to last at least a year, as it was in no way part of Mr. Bennet's plans for them all to go to Newcastle.</t5153>
<t5154>––Oh, sir! I don't know!</t5154> <t5155>Perhaps it will take us two or three years!</t5155>
<t5156>––Write to me very often, dear.</t5156>
<t5157>––As often as I can.</t5157> <t5158>But you know that we married women don't have much time to write.</t5158> <t5159>My sisters will be able to write to me; they won't have anything else to do.</t5159>
<t5160>Wickham's farewell was much more affectionate than that of his wife.</t5160> <t5161>He smiled, was very pleasant, and said charming things.</t5161>
<t5162>––He is a very fine young man ––said Mr. Bennet as soon as they had left––; I have never seen another like him.</t5162> <t5163>He is a machine of smiles and flatters us all.</t5163> <t5164>I am extremely proud of him.</t5164> <t5165>I challenge even Sir William Lucas to find a more valuable son-in-law.</t5165>
<t5166>The loss of her daughter plunged Mrs. Bennet into sadness for several days.</t5166>
<t5167>––Many times I think ––he said–– that there is nothing worse than being separated from loved ones.</t5167> <t5168>One feels so helpless without them!</t5168>
<t5169>––Well, you see, that is a consequence of marrying off daughters ––observed Elizabeth––.</t5169> <t5170>It will make you happier if the other four of us remain single.</t5170>
<t5171>That's not it.</t5171> <t5172>Lydia doesn't leave me because she got married, but because her husband's regiment is far away.</t5172> <t5173>If it had been closer, she wouldn't have left so soon.</t5173>
<t5174>But the discouragement that this event caused him was quickly alleviated, and his mind began to function again with great agitation at the series of news circulating at that time.</t5174> <t5175>The housekeeper of Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, which was to take place within two or three days, to engage in hunting for a few weeks.</t5175> <t5176>Mrs. Bennet was extremely nervous.</t5176> <t5177>She looked at Jane and alternately smiled and shook her head.</t5177>
<t5178>––Well, well, so Mr. Bingley is coming, sister? ––for it was Mrs. Philips who first gave her the news––.</t5178> <t5179>Well, that's better.</t5179> <t5180>Although I don't care.</t5180> <t5181>You know we have nothing to do with him and I don't want to see him again.</t5181> <t5182>If he wants to come to Netherfield, let him come.</t5182> <t5183>And who knows what might happen?</t5183> <t5184>But we don't care.</t5184> <t5185>You know that we agreed a long time ago not to say another word about this.</t5185> <t5186>Is it true that he's coming?</t5186>
<t5187>––You can be sure of it ––replied the other––, because Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton yesterday afternoon; I saw her pass by and went out determined to know the truth; she told me that yes, her master was coming.</t5187> <t5188>He will come by Thursday at the latest; he might arrive on Wednesday.</t5188> <t5189>Mrs. Nicholls told me she was going to the butcher's to order meat for Wednesday and was carrying three pairs of ducks ready to be slaughtered.</t5189>
<t5190>Upon hearing the news, Jane changed color.</t5190> <t5191>It had been months since she and Elizabeth had spoken about Bingley, but now as soon as they were alone, she said to her:</t5191>
<t5192>––I have noticed, Elizabeth, that when my aunt was commenting on the news of the day, you were looking at me.</t5192> <t5193>I know it seemed like I was embarrassed, but don't think it was for some silly reason.</t5193> <t5194>I was confused for a moment because I realized you all were watching me.</t5194> <t5195>I assure you that the news neither saddens nor pleases me.</t5195> <t5196>One thing I am glad about: that he is coming alone, because that way we will see him less.</t5196> <t5197>It's not that I'm afraid for myself, but I fear people's comments.</t5197>
<t5198>Elizabeth did not know what to think.</t5198> <t5199>If she had not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have believed that he came only for the mentioned reason, but she did not doubt that he still loved Jane, and she even ventured to think that he came with his friend's approval or that he had dared to come without it.</t5199>
<t5200>"It's hard," he sometimes thought, "that this poor man can't come to a house he has legally rented without raising all these suspicions.</t5200> <t5201>I'll leave him alone."</t5201>
<t5202>Despite what her sister said and believed in good faith, Elizabeth could notice that the expectation of Bingley's arrival affected her.</t5202> <t5203>She was different and more troubled than usual.</t5203>
<t5204>The topic that their parents had heatedly discussed a year ago came up again now.</t5204> <t5205>––My dear, I suppose that as soon as Mr. Bingley arrives, you will go visit him.</t5205>
<t5206>––No and no.</t5206> <t5207>You forced me to do it last year, promising me that he would marry one of my daughters.</t5207> <t5208>But it all came to nothing, and I don't want to make such a fool of myself again.</t5208>
<t5209>His wife pointed out to him how absolutely necessary that attention from all the gentlemen in the neighborhood would be as soon as Bingley arrived at Netherfield.</t5209>
<t5210>––It is a label that irritates me ––replied Mr. Bennet––.</t5210> <t5211>If he wants our company, let him seek it; he knows where we live.</t5211> <t5212>I cannot waste time running after the neighbors every time they leave and return.</t5212>
<t5213>––Well, it will be very rude of you not to visit him; but that won't stop me from inviting him to dinner.</t5213> <t5214>We will soon have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings at the table, and counting ourselves, we will be thirteen, so there will be just one place for him.</t5214>
<t5215>Consoled by this decision, she was perfectly prepared to endure her husband's discourtesy, although it greatly bothered her that, because of this, all the neighbors would see Bingley before they did.</t5215> <t5216>As the day of the arrival approached, Jane said:</t5216>
<t5217>––Despite everything, I am beginning to feel that he is coming.</t5217> <t5218>I wouldn't mind at all and I will see him with the greatest indifference, but I can't stand hearing about him perpetually.</t5218> <t5219>My mother does it with the best intentions, but she doesn't know, nor does anyone, the suffering it causes me.</t5219> <t5220>I won't be happy until Bingley has left Netherfield.</t5220>
<t5221>––I would like to say something to console you ––Elizabeth replied––, but I cannot.</t5221> <t5222>You must understand that.</t5222> <t5223>And the usual satisfaction of recommending patience to those who suffer is denied to me because you never lack it.</t5223>
<t5224>Bingley arrived.</t5224> <t5225>Mrs. Bennet tried to obtain the first news with the help of the maids, to increase the anxiety and bad mood that consumed her.</t5225> <t5226>She counted the days that had to pass to invite him, as she did not hope to see him before then.</t5226> <t5227>But on the third morning of Bingley's arrival in the county, she saw from her dressing room window that he was entering through the gate on horseback and heading towards the house.</t5227>
<t5228>He immediately called his daughters to share his joy.</t5228> <t5229>Jane refused to leave her place by the table.</t5229> <t5230>But Elizabeth, to please her mother, approached the window, looked out and saw that Bingley was entering with Darcy, and sat back down next to her sister.</t5230>
<t5231>––Mom, another gentleman is coming with him ––said Catherine––.</t5231> <t5232>Who could it be?</t5232>
<t5233>––I suppose some acquaintance of yours, dear; I don't know him.</t5233>
<t5234>––Oh! –– exclaimed Catherine––.</t5234> <t5235>It looks like that gentleman who was with him before.</t5235> <t5236>The gentleman... what's his name?</t5236> <t5237>That tall and proud gentleman.</t5237>
<t5238>––Holy God! Mr. Darcy?</t5238> <t5239>Well, yes, it's him.</t5239> <t5240>Well; any friend of Mr. Bingley will always be welcome in this house; if it weren't for that...</t5240> <t5241>I can't stand the sight of him.</t5241>
<t5242>Jane looked at Elizabeth with astonishment and interest.</t5242> <t5243>She knew very little about her encounter in Derbyshire and, consequently, understood the horror that seeing Darcy almost for the first time after the clarifying letter must have caused her sister.</t5243> <t5244>The two sisters were quite uneasy; each suffered for the other, and naturally, for herself.</t5244> <t5245>Meanwhile, the mother continued to rant about her hatred for Darcy and her decision to be courteous to him only out of consideration for Bingley.</t5245> <t5246>None of the girls were listening to her.</t5246> <t5247>Elizabeth was troubled by something Jane could not suspect, as she had never dared to show her Mrs. Gardiner's letter, nor to reveal the change in her feelings for Darcy.</t5247> <t5248>To Jane, Darcy was nothing more than the man whose proposals Elizabeth had rejected and whose merits she had undervalued.</t5248> <t5249>But to Elizabeth, Darcy was the man to whom her family owed the greatest of favors, and whom she regarded with an interest, if not as tender, at least as reasonable and just as the one Jane felt for Bingley.</t5249> <t5250>Her astonishment at Darcy's coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, seeking her again voluntarily, was almost equal to what she experienced upon seeing him so changed in Derbyshire.</t5250>
<t5251>The color, which had disappeared from her countenance, rushed violently to her cheeks, and a smile of pleasure brightened her eyes at the thought that Darcy's affection and desires remained the same.</t5251> <t5252>But she did not want to take it for granted.</t5252>
<t5253>"First, I will see how he behaves," he said to himself, "and then God will decide if I can have hopes."</t5253>
<t5254>He set to work attentively and strove to remain calm.</t5254> <t5255>He did not dare to raise his eyes until his growing curiosity made him look at his sister when the maid went to open the door.</t5255> <t5256>Jane was paler than usual, but calmer than Elizabeth had believed.</t5256> <t5257>When the two gentlemen entered, she blushed, but received them quite calmly, without showing any sign of resentment or unnecessary complacency.</t5257>
<t5258>Elizabeth spoke to the two young men as little as politeness allowed, and devoted herself to her embroidery with more application than ever.</t5258> <t5259>She only ventured to cast a glance at Darcy.</t5259> <t5260>He was as serious as always, and it seemed to her that he resembled more the Darcy she had known in Hertfordshire than the one she had seen at Pemberley.</t5260> <t5261>But perhaps in the presence of his mother, he did not feel the same as in the presence of her uncles.</t5261> <t5262>It was a painful supposition, but not an improbable one.</t5262>
<t5263>He also glanced at Bingley for a moment, and it seemed to him that he was both happy and embarrassed at the same time.</t5263> <t5264>Mrs. Bennet received him with such fuss that it left her two daughters embarrassed, especially due to the contrast with her cold and ceremonious manner of greeting and treating Darcy.</t5264>
<t5265>Particularly Elizabeth, knowing that her mother owed Darcy the salvation of her favorite daughter from such irremediable infamy, was deeply saddened by that rudeness.</t5265>
<t5266>Darcy asked how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were, and Elizabeth answered him with some unease.</t5266> <t5267>After that, she barely said anything.</t5267> <t5268>He was not seated next to Elizabeth, and perhaps this was the reason for his silence; but it was not like this in Derbyshire.</t5268> <t5269>There, when he couldn't talk to her, he spoke with his friends; but now several minutes passed without his voice being heard, and when Elizabeth, unable to contain her curiosity, looked up at him, she found him more frequently looking at Jane than at her, and often only looking at the ground.</t5269> <t5270>He seemed more pensive and less eager to please than in their last meeting.</t5270> <t5271>Elizabeth was disappointed and displeased with herself because of it.</t5271>
<t5272>"How could I imagine it would be any different?" he said to himself.</t5272> <t5273>"I don't even know why she came here."</t5273>
<t5274>She had no mood to talk to anyone except him, but she lacked the courage to speak to him.</t5274> <t5275>She asked him about his sister, but then she didn't know what else to say.</t5275>
<t5276>––A lot of time has passed, Mr. Bingley, since you left ––said Mrs. Bennet.</t5276> <t5277>––Indeed ––said Bingley.</t5277>
<t5278>––I was beginning to fear ––she continued–– that you would not return.</t5278> <t5279>People say that by Saint Michael's day you plan to leave this region; but I hope that's not true.</t5279> <t5280>Many things have happened in the neighborhood since you left; Miss Lucas got married and is settled in Hunsford, and one of my daughters also got married.</t5280> <t5281>I suppose you must have known, surely you must have read it in the newspapers.</t5281> <t5282>It was in the Times and in the Courrier, only it wasn't well written.</t5282> <t5283>It only said: "Mr. George Wickham married Miss Lydia Bennet," without mentioning her father or where the bride lived or anything.</t5283> <t5284>The notice must have been the work of my brother Gardiner, and I don't understand how he could have done something so curt.</t5284> <t5285>Did you see it?</t5285>
<t5286>Bingley replied that he did and congratulated her.</t5286> <t5287>Elizabeth did not dare to raise her eyes and could not see what expression Darcy had.</t5287>
<t5288>––It is delightful to have a well-married daughter ––she continued saying––, but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard that she has gone so far away.</t5288> <t5289>They have moved to Newcastle, which is very far North, I believe, and they will be there for I don't know how long.</t5289> <t5290>My son-in-law's regiment is stationed there, because you may have heard that he has left the county garrison and has joined the regulars.</t5290> <t5291>Thank God he still has some friends, although perhaps not as many as he deserves.</t5291>
<t5292>Elizabeth, knowing that this was directed at Darcy, felt so embarrassed that she could barely stay in her chair.</t5292> <t5293>However, she made a supreme effort to speak and asked Bingley if he planned to stay in the countryside for long.</t5293> <t5294>He replied that a few weeks.</t5294>
<t5295>––When you have killed all your birds, Mr. Bingley ––said Mrs. Bennet––, come and kill all you want on my husband's property.</t5295> <t5296>I am sure he will be very pleased and will reserve his best nests for you.</t5296>
<t5297>Elizabeth's discomfort increased with such unnecessary and officious attention.</t5297> <t5298>She had no doubt that all those illusions that were reborn after a year would end again in the same way.</t5298> <t5299>She thought that entire years of happiness could not compensate her and Jane for those moments of painful confusion.</t5299>
<t5300>“I desire only one thing,” he said to himself, “and that is to never see either of these two men again.</t5300> <t5301>All the pleasure their company might provide is not enough to compensate for this shame.</t5301> <t5302>I wish I never had to meet them again!”</t5302>
<t5303>But that misfortune, which years of happiness could not compensate for, was somewhat alleviated shortly after by noticing that her sister's beauty once again awakened the admiration of her former suitor.</t5303> <t5304>At first, Bingley spoke very little with Jane, but with each moment he seemed more captivated by her.</t5304> <t5305>He found her as beautiful as the previous year, as sensitive and as affable, though not as talkative.</t5305> <t5306>Jane wished that no change would be noticed in her and believed she spoke as always, but her mind was so occupied that sometimes she did not realize her silence.</t5306>
<t5307>When the gentlemen rose to leave, Mrs. Bennet did not forget her planned invitation.</t5307> <t5308>The two young men accepted, and it was agreed that they would dine at Longbourn in a few days.</t5308>
<t5309>––You owed me a visit, Mr. Bingley,–– added Mrs. Bennet––, for when you went to the capital last winter, you promised to dine with us as soon as you returned.</t5309> <t5310>You see, I have not forgotten.</t5310> <t5311>I was very upset that you did not come back to fulfill your commitment.</t5311>
<t5312>Bingley seemed a little puzzled by that remark, and said he was very sorry, but that his affairs had detained him.</t5312> <t5313>Darcy and he left.</t5313>
<t5314>Mrs. Bennet had been on the verge of inviting them to dine that very day, but despite the fact that one always ate well in her house, she did not believe that two courses would in any way be sufficient for a man who inspired such ambitious projects in her, nor to satisfy the appetite and pride of another who had ten thousand pounds a year in income.</t5314>
<t5315>CHAPTER LIV</t5315>
<t5316>As soon as they left, Elizabeth went for a walk to recover her spirits or, rather, to ponder the cause that had made her lose them.</t5316> <t5317>Darcy's behavior had her astonished and angry.</t5317> <t5318>Why did he come ––she asked herself–– to be silent, serious, and indifferent?</t5318>
<t5319>He couldn't explain it to her satisfactorily.</t5319>
<t5320>“If he could be kind and accommodating with my uncles in London, why not with me?</t5320> <t5321>If he feared me, why did he come?</t5321> <t5322>And if he no longer cares about me, why was he so quiet?</t5322> <t5323>What an irritating man!</t5323> <t5324>I don't want to think about him anymore.”</t5324>
<t5325>Involuntarily, she maintained this resolution for a while, because her sister approached, whose cheerful appearance showed that she was more satisfied with the visit than she was.</t5325>
<t5326>––Now ––she said to him––, after this first encounter, I feel completely calm.</t5326> <t5327>I know that I am strong and that I will no longer be flustered in front of him.</t5327> <t5328>I'm glad he's coming to dinner on Tuesday, because that way it will be clear that we treat each other simply as indifferent friends.</t5328>
<t5329>––Yes, very indifferent ––replied Elizabeth, laughing––.</t5329> <t5330>Oh, Jane! Be careful!</t5330>
<t5331>––Lizzy, dear, you are not going to believe that I am so weak as to be in any danger.</t5331>
<t5332>––I think you are in a very big one, because he loves you as always.</t5332>
<t5333>They did not see Bingley again until Tuesday, and in the meantime, Mrs. Bennet indulged in all the hopeful plans that the gentleman's joy and constant sweetness had revived in her during half an hour of visit.</t5333> <t5334>On Tuesday, a large group of people gathered at Longbourn, and the gentlemen who were most eagerly awaited arrived with perfect punctuality.</t5334> <t5335>When they entered the dining room, Elizabeth watched Bingley closely to see if he would take the place that had always been his at previous meals next to her sister; her prudent mother, thinking the same, was very careful not to invite him to sit next to her.</t5335> <t5336>Bingley seemed to hesitate, but Jane happened to smile around the room, and the matter was settled: Bingley sat next to Jane.</t5336>
<t5337>Elizabeth, with triumphant satisfaction, looked at Darcy.</t5337> <t5338>He met her gaze with noble indifference; Elizabeth would have imagined that Bingley had already obtained his friend's permission to enjoy his happiness if she had not caught his eyes also turned towards Darcy, with a smiling but alarmed expression.</t5338>
<t5339>Bingley's behavior towards Jane during the meal revealed the admiration he felt for her, and although it was more circumspect than before, Elizabeth was convinced that if it depended solely on him, their happiness and Jane's would soon be assured.</t5339> <t5340>Despite not daring to trust the outcome, Elizabeth was very satisfied and felt as encouraged as her bad mood allowed.</t5340> <t5341>Darcy was on the other side of the table, seated next to Mrs. Bennet, and Elizabeth understood how unpleasant such an arrangement was for both of them, and how little advantageous it was for anyone.</t5341> <t5342>She was not close enough to hear what they were saying, but she could observe that they hardly spoke to each other and how cold and ceremonious their manners were when they did.</t5342> <t5343>This antipathy of her mother towards Darcy made the memory of what everyone owed him more painful for Elizabeth, and there were moments when she would have given anything to be able to say that his kindness was neither unknown nor unappreciated by the entire family.</t5343>
<t5344>She hoped that the afternoon would give her the opportunity to be by Darcy's side and that the visit would not end without exchanging more than just the simple greeting upon arrival.</t5344> <t5345>She was so anxious and uneasy that while waiting in the parlor for the gentlemen to enter, her unease almost put her in a bad mood.</t5345> <t5346>Her entire hope for pleasure that afternoon depended on Darcy's presence.</t5346>
<t5347>"If he doesn't come towards me," she said to herself, "I will give up."</t5347>
<t5348>The gentlemen entered, and it seemed that Darcy was going to do what she longed for; but unfortunately, the ladies had gathered around the table where Mrs. Bennet was preparing tea and Elizabeth was serving coffee. They were all so crowded together that there was no free spot beside her nor room for another chair.</t5348> <t5349>As the gentlemen approached, one of the girls came up to Elizabeth and whispered in her ear:</t5349>
<t5350>––The men will not come to separate us; I have already decided; we don't need them at all, do we?</t5350>
<t5351>Darcy then went to another part of the room.</t5351> <t5352>Elizabeth watched him and envied everyone he talked to; she could barely muster the patience to serve the coffee, and she became furious with herself for being so foolish.</t5352>
<t5353>“A man whom I have rejected!”</t5353> <t5354>I must be crazy if I expect his love to be rekindled.</t5354> <t5355>There isn't a single man who wouldn't rebel against the weakness of making a second declaration to the same woman.</t5355> <t5356>There is no greater indignity for them.”</t5356>
<t5357>She perked up a bit upon seeing Darcy coming to return her coffee cup, and she seized the opportunity to ask him:</t5357>
<t5358>––Is your sister still at Pemberley?</t5358>
<t5359>––Yes, he will be there until Christmas.</t5359>
<t5360>––And are you alone?</t5360> <t5361>Have all your friends left already?</t5361>
<t5362>––Only Mrs. Annesley is accompanying her; the others have gone to Scarborough to spend these three weeks.</t5362>
<t5363>Elizabeth couldn't think of anything else to say, but if he had wanted to talk, how gladly she would have answered him!</t5363> <t5364>Nevertheless, he stayed by her side for a few minutes, in silence, until the girl from before started whispering to Elizabeth, and then he withdrew.</t5364>
<t5365>Once the tea service was removed and the game tables were set up, all the ladies stood up.</t5365> <t5366>Elizabeth then thought she might be able to be with him, but her hopes were dashed when she saw her mother take hold of Darcy and force him to sit at her whist table.</t5366> <t5367>Elizabeth gave up all her illusions.</t5367> <t5368>They were confined to different tables all afternoon, but Darcy's eyes turned so often to where she was that both of them lost all their games.</t5368>
<t5369>Mrs. Bennet had planned for the two gentlemen from Netherfield to stay for dinner, but they were the first to ask for their carriage and there was no way to detain them.</t5369>
<t5370>––Well, girls ––said the mother as soon as everyone had left––, what do you say?</t5370> <t5371>In my view, everything went perfectly today.</t5371> <t5372>The meal was as well presented as the best I've seen; the roasted venison was perfect, and everyone said the haunches were superb; the soup was fifty times better than the one we were served last week at the Lucas's; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were very well done, and he must have two or three French cooks.</t5372> <t5373>And, besides, dear Jane, you have never looked prettier than this afternoon; Mrs. Long confirmed it when I asked her opinion.</t5373> <t5374>And what do you think she told me, moreover? "Oh, Mrs. Bennet, we will finally have her at Netherfield!"</t5374> <t5375>That's exactly what she said.</t5375> <t5376>I think Mrs. Long is the best person in the world, and her nieces are very well-mannered girls and not at all unattractive; I like them very much.</t5376>
<t5377>All in all, Mrs. Bennet was in a splendid mood.</t5377> <t5378>She had observed Bingley's behavior towards Jane enough to convince herself that he was finally going to propose.</t5378> <t5379>She was so excited and her fantasies about the great future awaiting her family went so far beyond reason that she was extremely upset when Bingley did not show up the next day to propose.</t5379>
<t5380>––It has been a very pleasant day ––said Jane to Elizabeth––.</t5380> <t5381>How select and cordial the party was!</t5381> <t5382>I hope it happens again.</t5382>
<t5383>Elizabeth smiled.</t5383>
<t5384>––Don't laugh.</t5384> <t5385>It hurts me that you are like this, Lizzy.</t5385> <t5386>I assure you that now I have learned to enjoy his conversation and that I see in him nothing but an intelligent and kind young man.</t5386> <t5387>I love his behavior and I don't care that he has never thought of me.</t5387> <t5388>I only find that his manner is sweet and more attentive than that of any other man.</t5388>
<t5389>––You're cruel! ––replied her sister––.</t5389> <t5390>You don't let me smile and you're provoking me to do so at every moment.</t5390>
<t5391>––How difficult it is to be believed in some cases!</t5391>
<t5392>––And how impossible in others!</t5392>
<t5393>––Why do you insist on convincing me that I feel more than I confess?</t5393>
<t5394>––I wouldn't know what to tell you.</t5394> <t5395>We all like to give lessons, but we only teach what is not worth knowing.</t5395> <t5396>Forgive me, but if you persist in your indifference, it's better that I not be your confidant.</t5396>
<t5397>CHAPTER LV</t5397>
<t5398>A few days after that visit, Bingley returned to Longbourn, alone.</t5398> <t5399>His friend had gone to London in the morning, but was going to return within ten days.</t5399> <t5400>He spent an hour with them and was in excellent spirits.</t5400> <t5401>Mrs. Bennet invited him to dinner, Bingley said he was sorry, but he was already engaged elsewhere.</t5401>
<t5402>––Next time he comes ––replied Mrs. Bennet–– I hope we have better luck.</t5402>
<t5403>––I will be very pleased ––replied Bingley.</t5403> <t5404>And he added that, if they allowed him, he would take any opportunity to visit them.</t5404>
<t5405>––Can you come tomorrow?</t5405>
<t5406>Bingley said yes, as he had no commitments for the next day.</t5406>
<t5407>He arrived so early that none of the ladies were dressed. Mrs. Bennet ran to her daughters' room, in her dressing gown and half-combed, exclaiming:</t5407>
<t5408>––Jane, dear, hurry up and go downstairs!</t5408> <t5409>Mr. Bingley has come!</t5409> <t5410>It's him, without a doubt.</t5410> <t5411>Come, Sara!</t5411> <t5412>Go immediately to help Miss Jane get dressed.</t5412> <t5413>Don't worry about Miss Elizabeth's hair.</t5413>
<t5414>––We will come down as soon as we can ––said Jane––, but it seems to me that Catherine is ahead of us, because she went up half an hour ago.</t5414>
<t5415>––Look at what you're coming up with!</t5415> <t5416>What does Catherine have to do with this?</t5416> <t5417>You are the one who should go down immediately.</t5417> <t5418>Where is your corset?</t5418>
<t5419>But when her mother had gone out, Jane did not want to go downstairs without one of her sisters.</t5419>
<t5420>In the afternoon, the mother again tried to get Bingley alone with Jane.</t5420> <t5421>After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to his library as usual, and Mary went upstairs to play the piano.</t5421> <t5422>With two of the five obstacles gone, Mrs. Bennet began to look around and make signs and winks at Elizabeth and Catherine without them noticing.</t5422> <t5423>Catherine noticed it before Elizabeth and asked quite innocently:</t5423>
<t5424>––What’s wrong, Mom?</t5424> <t5425>Why are you signaling to me? What do you want me to do?</t5425>
<t5426>––Nothing, girl, nothing.</t5426> <t5427>I wasn't signaling you at all.</t5427>
<t5428>She remained seated for five more minutes, but she was unable to waste such a precious opportunity.</t5428> <t5429>She suddenly stood up and said to Catherine:</t5429>
<t5430>––Come, darling.</t5430> <t5431>I need to talk to you.</t5431>
<t5432>And he took her out of the room.</t5432> <t5433>Jane instantly looked at Elizabeth, showing her regret for such a premeditated departure and asking her not to leave.</t5433>
<t5434>But a few minutes later, Mrs. Bennet opened the door and said to Elizabeth:</t5434>
<t5435>––Come, dear.</t5435> <t5436>I need to talk to you.</t5436>
<t5437>Elizabeth had no choice but to leave.</t5437>
<t5438>––Let's leave them alone, do you understand? ––her mother said to her in the hallway––.</t5438> <t5439>Catherine and I are going upstairs to my room.</t5439>
<t5440>Elizabeth did not dare to argue with her mother; but she stayed in the hall until she saw her disappear with Catherine, and then she returned to the drawing room.</t5440>
<t5441>Mrs. Bennet's plans did not come to fruition that day.</t5441> <t5442>Bingley was a model of kindness, but not the declared suitor of her daughter.</t5442> <t5443>His ease and cheerfulness greatly contributed to the liveliness of the evening gathering; he endured all the mother's indiscretions and impertinences and listened to all her foolish warnings with a patience and serenity that left Jane very pleased.</t5443>
<t5444>He only needed to be invited to stay for dinner, and before he left, Mrs. Bennet extended a new invitation for him to come the next morning to hunt with her husband.</t5444>
<t5445>After this day, Jane no longer said that Bingley was indifferent to her.</t5445> <t5446>The two sisters did not speak a word about him, but Elizabeth went to bed with the happy conviction that everything would soon be resolved, if Darcy did not return before the indicated time.</t5446> <t5447>However, she was seriously convinced that all this would have happened just the same without the absence of said gentleman.</t5447>
<t5448>Bingley arrived punctually at the appointment, and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together as agreed.</t5448> <t5449>Mr. Bennet was much more pleasant than his companion had expected.</t5449> <t5450>There was nothing in Bingley of presumption or foolishness that the other could ridicule or be internally displeased with, so he was more communicative and less surly than usual.</t5450> <t5451>Naturally, Bingley returned with Mr. Bennet to the house for lunch, and in the afternoon, Mrs. Bennet once again schemed to leave him alone with her daughter.</t5451> <t5452>Elizabeth had to write a letter, and for that purpose, she went to the small drawing room shortly after tea, for as the others had sat down to play, her presence was no longer necessary to thwart her mother's plots.</t5452>
<t5453>But upon entering the room, after having finished the letter, she saw with infinite surprise that there was reason to fear that her mother had gotten her way.</t5453> <t5454>Indeed, upon opening the door, she spotted her sister and Bingley alone, leaning against the fireplace as if absorbed in the most interesting conversation; and if this had not already given rise to all suspicions, their faces, as they quickly turned and separated, would have said it all.</t5454> <t5455>The situation must have been very embarrassing for them, but Elizabeth was about to leave when Bingley, who, like Jane, had sat down, suddenly stood up, whispered a few words in Jane's ear, and left the room.</t5455>
<t5456>Jane could not keep secrets from Elizabeth, especially not a piece of news that she knew would make her happy.</t5456> <t5457>She hugged her tightly and confessed with the most vivid emotion that she was the happiest woman in the world.</t5457>
<t5458>––It's too much! ––he added.</t5458> <t5459>It's too much!</t5459> <t5460>I don't deserve it.</t5460> <t5461>Oh! Why can't everyone be as happy as I am?</t5461>
<t5462>Elizabeth's congratulations were so sincere and so fervent, and revealed so much pleasure that it cannot be expressed in words.</t5462> <t5463>Each of her affectionate phrases was a source of joy for Jane.</t5463> <t5464>But she couldn't stay with Elizabeth nor tell her half of the things she still had to communicate.</t5464>
<t5465>––I'm going to see mom right away ––she said––.</t5465> <t5466>I can't ignore her affectionate concern nor allow her to find out from someone else.</t5466> <t5467>He just went to talk to dad.</t5467> <t5468>Oh, Lizzy!</t5468> <t5469>What I'm going to say will fill the whole family with joy.</t5469> <t5470>How will I be able to withstand so much happiness?</t5470>
<t5471>He went hurriedly in search of his mother who had deliberately suspended the card game and was upstairs with Catherine.</t5471>
<t5472>Elizabeth stood smiling at the ease and speed with which a matter that had caused so many months of uncertainty and pain had been resolved.</t5472>
<t5473>"Behold what it has come to," he said to himself, "the anxious circumspection of his friend and all the falseness and tricks of his sisters!"</t5473> <t5474>No happier, more prudent, or more reasonable outcome could have been given.</t5474>
<t5475>A few minutes later, Bingley entered, having finished his short conference with Mr. Bennet.</t5475> <t5476>––Where is your sister? ––he said as soon as he opened the door.</t5476>
<t5477>––Upstairs, with mom.</t5477> <t5478>I think she'll come down soon.</t5478>
<t5479>Then Bingley closed the door and asked for his congratulations, begging him to consider him as a brother.</t5479> <t5480>Elizabeth told him with all her heart how happy she was about this future relationship.</t5480> <t5481>They shook hands very cordially, and until Jane came down, Bingley talked about his happiness and the perfections of his beloved.</t5481> <t5482>Elizabeth did not believe his hopes for happiness were exaggerated, despite the love that blinded the young man, because Jane's good understanding and excellent heart were joined by the similarity of feelings and tastes with his fiancée.</t5482>
<t5483>The afternoon passed amid general enchantment; Jane's satisfaction gave her face a light and an expression so sweet that it made her seem more beautiful than ever.</t5483> <t5484>Catherine smiled, thinking that her turn would come soon.</t5484> <t5485>Mrs. Bennet gave her consent and expressed her approval in the warmest terms, which, nevertheless, did not manage to describe the joy she felt, and for half an hour she could talk to Bingley about nothing else.</t5485> <t5486>When Mr. Bennet joined them for dinner, his voice and appearance revealed his joy.</t5486>
<t5487>But not a word escaped his lips that alluded to the matter until the guest took his leave.</t5487> <t5488>As soon as he had gone, Mr. Bennet turned to his daughter and said:</t5488>
<t5489>––Congratulations, Jane.</t5489> <t5490>You will be a very happy woman.</t5490> <t5491>Jane ran to her father, gave him a kiss, and thanked him for his kindness.</t5491>
<t5492>––You are a good girl ––added the father–– and you deserve the luck you have had.</t5492> <t5493>You will get along very well.</t5493> <t5494>Your characters are very similar.</t5494> <t5495>You are so accommodating to each other that you will never resolve anything, so trusting that any servant will deceive you, and so generous that you will always spend more than you have.</t5495>
<t5496>––That certainly not.</t5496> <t5497>Carelessness or negligence in financial matters would be unforgivable for me.</t5497> <t5498>––Spending more than one has! ––exclaimed Mrs. Bennet––.</t5498> <t5499>What are you saying?</t5499> <t5500>Bingley has four or five thousand pounds a year, maybe more.</t5500> <t5501>Then, turning to her daughter, she added:</t5501>
<t5502>Oh, Jane, dear, my life, I am so happy that I won't be able to close my eyes all night!</t5502> <t5503>I always knew this would happen; I always said that in the end everything would work out.</t5503> <t5504>I was sure that your beauty would not be in vain.</t5504> <t5505>I remember that as soon as I saw him the first time he arrived in Hertfordshire, I thought that you two had to get married.</t5505> <t5506>He is the most handsome man I have seen in my life!</t5506>
<t5507>Wickham and Lydia were forgotten.</t5507> <t5508>Jane was now her favorite daughter, without any comparison; at that moment, the others did not matter to her at all.</t5508> <t5509>The younger sisters soon began to ask Jane for everything they wanted and that she would be able to provide them shortly.</t5509>
<t5510>Mary wanted to use the Netherfield library, and Catherine begged her to organize a few dances there in the winter.</t5510>
<t5511>Bingley, as was natural, went to Longbourn every day.</t5511> <t5512>He often arrived before lunch and stayed until after dinner, except when some barbaric neighbor, never detested enough, invited him to dine, and Bingley felt obliged to accept.</t5512>
<t5513>Elizabeth had few opportunities to converse with her sister, for while Bingley was present, Jane had no eyes or ears for anyone else; but she was very useful to both of them during the hours of separation that were sometimes imposed.</t5513> <t5514>In Jane's absence, Bingley always sought out Elizabeth to indulge in talking about his beloved; and when Bingley left, Jane constantly turned to the same consolation.</t5514> <t5515>––You don't know how happy he made me ––she told her sister one night–– by telling me that he was unaware I had been in London last spring!</t5515> <t5516>It seemed impossible to me!</t5516>
<t5517>––I figured as much.</t5517> <t5518>But how do you explain it?</t5518>
<t5519>––It must have been the work of his sisters.</t5519> <t5520>The truth is that they didn't want anything to do with me, which doesn't surprise me, since Bingley could have found someone better from every point of view.</t5520> <t5521>But when they see, as I suppose they will, that their brother is happy by my side, they will be content, and we will be friends again, although never as before.</t5521>
<t5522>––This is the most unforgivable thing I have ever heard you say in my life ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t5522> <t5523>Wretch!</t5523> <t5524>It truly irritates me that you believe in Miss Bingley's supposed friendship.</t5524>
<t5525>––Do you believe, Elizabeth, that when he went to the capital last November, he truly loved me and only the certainty that I was indifferent to him prevented him from returning?</t5525>
<t5526>––He made a small mistake, actually; but this speaks very well of his modesty.</t5526>
<t5527>This naturally led Jane to praise her fiancé's lack of conceit and the little value he placed on his own qualities.</t5527>
<t5528>Elizabeth was glad that she had not betrayed her friend by speaking of his interference, for although Jane possessed the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, this might have created some prejudice against Darcy in her.</t5528>
<t5529>––I am undoubtedly the luckiest creature on earth, exclaimed Jane.</t5529> <t5530>Oh, Lizzy, I feel so sorry to be the happiest in the house!</t5530> <t5531>If only you were too!</t5531> <t5532>If only there were another man like Bingley for you!</t5532>
<t5533>––Even if you gave me forty like him, I would never be as happy as you.</t5533> <t5534>As long as I don't have your disposition, I will never be able to enjoy such happiness.</t5534> <t5535>No, no; leave me as I am.</t5535> <t5536>If I am lucky, I might find another Collins in time.</t5536>
<t5537>The state of the affairs of the Longbourn family could not remain a secret.</t5537> <t5538>Mrs. Bennet had the privilege of communicating it to Mrs. Philips, who then proceeded to broadcast it without prior permission to the houses of all the neighbors in Meryton.</t5538>
<t5539>The Bennets were soon proclaimed the luckiest family in the world, despite the fact that a few weeks earlier, on the occasion of Lydia's elopement, they had been regarded as the most unfortunate people on earth.</t5539>
<t5540>CHAPTER LVI</t5540>
<t5541>One morning, approximately a week after Bingley's declaration, while he was gathered in the sitting room with the ladies of Longbourn, they were drawn by the noise of a carriage and looked out the window, spotting a landau with four horses crossing the lawn in front of the house.</t5541> <t5542>It was too early for visits and besides, the carriage's team did not belong to any of the neighbors; the horses were post horses and neither the carriage nor the livery of the footmen were familiar to them.</t5542> <t5543>But it was evident that someone was coming to the house.</t5543> <t5544>Bingley proposed to Jane that they go for a walk in the shrubbery to avoid being separated by the intruder.</t5544> <t5545>The two of them left, and the three who stayed in the dining room continued their conjectures, though with little satisfaction, until the door opened and the visitor entered.</t5545> <t5546>It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</t5546>
<t5547>It is true that everyone was expecting some surprise, but this one exceeded all expectations.</t5547> <t5548>Although Mrs. Bennet and Catherine did not know that lady, they were no less astonished than Elizabeth.</t5548>
<t5549>He entered the room with an even more unpleasant air than usual; he responded to Elizabeth's greeting with a simple nod of his head and sat down without saying a word.</t5549> <t5550>Elizabeth had mentioned his name to Mrs. Bennet when His Lordship entered, although she had not requested any introduction.</t5550>
<t5551>Mrs. Bennet, astonished yet very proud to have a person of such high rank in her home, received her with the utmost courtesy.</t5551> <t5552>They all sat in silence for a while, until at last Lady Catherine said to Elizabeth with great pomp:</t5552>
<t5553>––I suppose you are well, and I assume that lady is your mother.</t5553>
<t5554>Elizabeth answered concisely in the affirmative.</t5554>
<t5555>––And that other one I imagine must be one of his sisters.</t5555>
<t5556>––Yes, ma'am ––Mrs. Bennet responded, very proud to be able to speak with Lady Catherine––.</t5556> <t5557>She is the second youngest; the youngest of all got married recently, and the eldest is in the garden walking with a gentleman who I believe will soon become part of our family.</t5557>
<t5558>––You have a very small farm ––said His Lordship after a short silence.</t5558>
<t5559>––It is nothing compared to Rosings, madam; one must admit it; but I assure you it is much better than Sir William Lucas's.</t5559>
<t5560>––This must be a very uncomfortable room in the summer afternoons; the windows face completely west.</t5560>
<t5561>Mrs. Bennet assured her that they were never there after dinner, and added:</t5561>
<t5562>––May I take the liberty of asking Your Lordship how you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins?</t5562>
<t5563>––Very well; I saw them the night before last.</t5563> <t5564>Elizabeth hoped that she would now give her some letter from Charlotte, as this seemed the only likely reason for her visit; but Lady Catherine did not take out any letter, and Elizabeth remained perplexed.</t5564>
<t5565>Mrs. Bennet delicately entreated Her Ladyship to take something, but Lady Catherine firmly declined the offer without excessive politeness.</t5565> <t5566>Then, rising, she said to Elizabeth:</t5566>
<t5567>––Miss Bennet, it seems to me that over there, beside the meadow, there is a beautiful and secluded spot.</t5567> <t5568>I would like to take a walk there if you would do me the honor of accompanying me.</t5568>
<t5569>––Come on, dear ––exclaimed the mother––, show His Lordship all the walks.</t5569> <t5570>I think he will like the hermitage.</t5570>
<t5571>Elizabeth obeyed, ran to her room to fetch her umbrella, and waited downstairs for her noble visitor.</t5571> <t5572>As she passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors to the dining room and the drawing room, and after a brief inspection, declared that they were decent rooms, after which she continued walking.</t5572>
<t5573>The carriage was still at the door, and Elizabeth saw that Her Ladyship's maid was in it.</t5573> <t5574>They walked silently along the gravel path that led to the stables.</t5574> <t5575>Elizabeth was determined not to engage in conversation with that lady who seemed even more insolent and unpleasant than usual.</t5575>
<t5576>How could I ever say that she looked like her nephew?, he said to himself as he looked at her face.</t5576>
<t5577>When they entered a thicket, Lady Catherine said the following to him:</t5577>
<t5578>––Surely you must know, Miss Bennet, the reason for my journey here.</t5578> <t5579>Your own heart and conscience must tell you the motive for my visit.</t5579> <t5580>Elizabeth regarded her with natural astonishment:</t5580>
<t5581>––You are mistaken, madam.</t5581> <t5582>In no way can I explain the honor of your presence.</t5582>
<t5583>––Miss Bennet ––replied His Lordship in an angry tone––, you must know that I do not like jokes; no matter how insincere you wish to be, I am not like that.</t5583> <t5584>My character has always been celebrated for its loyalty and frankness, and in a matter of such importance as the one that brings me here, I will deviate much less from my way of being.</t5584> <t5585>It has come to my attention that not only is your sister about to marry very advantageously, but that you, Miss Bennet, may possibly unite with my nephew Darcy afterwards.</t5585> <t5586>Even knowing that this is a dreadful falsehood and although I do not wish to insult my nephew by admitting that there might be some hint of truth in it, I decided at once to come and communicate my feelings to you.</t5586>
<t5587>––If you truly believed that it was impossible –replied Elizabeth, red with astonishment and disdain–, I am amazed that you bothered to come so far.</t5587> <t5588>What is it that you intend?</t5588>
<t5589>––First of all, try to have that news corrected in all its parts.</t5589>
<t5590>––His coming to Longbourn to visit me and my family ––observed Elizabeth coldly––, will confirm it with more semblance of truth, if such news has circulated.</t5590>
<t5591>––Has it circulated?</t5591> <t5592>Do you intend to ignore it?</t5592> <t5593>Haven't you yourselves taken the trouble to spread it?</t5593>
<t5594>––I have never heard anything like it.</t5594>
<t5595>––And are you going to tell me as well that there is no basis for what I'm telling you?</t5595>
<t5596>––I do not presume to have as much frankness as Your Lordship.</t5596> <t5597>You may ask me questions that I may not want to answer.</t5597>
<t5598>––It's unbearable! Miss Bennet, I insist that you answer me.</t5598> <t5599>Has my nephew proposed to you?</t5599>
<t5600>––Your Honor has already declared that it was impossible.</t5600>
<t5601>––It must be so, it has to be so as long as Darcy retains the use of reason.</t5601> <t5602>But her arts and seductions may have made him forget in a moment of blindness what he owes to his entire family and to himself.</t5602> <t5603>Perhaps you have dragged him into doing it.</t5603>
<t5604>––If I had done it, it wouldn't be me confessing it.</t5604>
<t5605>––Miss Bennet, do you know who I am?</t5605> <t5606>I am not accustomed to that language.</t5606> <t5607>I am almost the closest relative my nephew has in the world, and I have reasons to know what his dearest interests are.</t5607>
<t5608>––But you do not have the right to know what mine are, nor is your behavior the most appropriate to induce me to be more explicit.</t5608>
<t5609>––Understand me well: that marriage to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place, never.</t5609> <t5610>Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter.</t5610> <t5611>What do you have to say now?</t5611>
<t5612>––Just this: that if it is so, you have no reason to suppose that you will make any proposition to me.</t5612>
<t5613>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment and then said:</t5613>
<t5614>––The commitment between them is peculiar.</t5614> <t5615>Since their childhood, they have been destined for each other.</t5615> <t5616>It was the greatest wish of his mother and hers.</t5616> <t5617>Since they were born, we have planned their union; and now, at the moment when the desires of the two sisters were about to be fulfilled, is it going to be thwarted by the intrusion of a girl of inferior birth, with no status, and completely unrelated to the family?</t5617> <t5618>Do the wishes of Darcy's friends, regarding his tacit engagement to Miss de Bourgh, mean nothing to you?</t5618> <t5619>Have you lost all sense of decency and delicacy?</t5619> <t5620>Did you not hear me say that from his earliest age he was destined for his cousin?</t5620>
<t5621>––Yes, I've heard it said; but, what does that have to do with me?</t5621> <t5622>If there were no other obstacle for me to marry your nephew, rest assured that our wedding would not be hindered by the assumption that his mother and aunt wished him to unite with Miss de Bourgh.</t5622> <t5623>You two did what you could by planning that marriage, but its realization depends on others.</t5623> <t5624>If Mr. Darcy does not feel bound to his cousin either by honor or inclination, why should he not choose another?</t5624> <t5625>And if I am the chosen one, why should I not accept him?</t5625>
<t5626>––Because honor, decorum, prudence, and even interest prevent it.</t5626> <t5627>Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; because you should not expect to be recognized by Darcy's family or friends if you stubbornly act against everyone's will.</t5627> <t5628>You will be censured, slighted, and despised by all of Darcy's relations.</t5628> <t5629>Your union will be a calamity; your names will never be spoken by any of us.</t5629>
<t5630>––Those are serious misfortunes ––replied Elizabeth––.</t5630> <t5631>But Mr. Darcy's wife will surely enjoy such blessings that she will still feel very satisfied.</t5631>
<t5632>––Ah, stubborn and obstinate creature!</t5632> <t5633>You make me ashamed!</t5633> <t5634>Is that your gratitude for my attentions last spring?</t5634> <t5635>Let us sit down.</t5635> <t5636>You must know, Miss Bennet, that I have come here with the firm resolution to achieve my purpose.</t5636> <t5637>I will not give up.</t5637> <t5638>I am not accustomed to submitting to anyone's whims; I am not made to endure disappointments.</t5638>
<t5639>––This may make His Lordship's current situation more distressing, but it does not affect me.</t5639> <t5640>––I don't want you to interrupt me!</t5640> <t5641>Listen in silence.</t5641> <t5642>My daughter and my nephew have been made for each other.</t5642> <t5643>On their maternal side, they descend from the same illustrious branch, and on their paternal side, from respectable, honorable, and ancient families, though without title.</t5643> <t5644>The fortune on both sides is splendid.</t5644> <t5645>They are destined for each other by the vote of all the members of their respective houses; and what can separate them?</t5645> <t5646>The untimely pretensions of a girl of humble birth and without fortune.</t5646> <t5647>How can this be admitted?</t5647> <t5648>But it will not happen!</t5648> <t5649>If she looked out for her own good, she would not want to leave the sphere in which she was born.</t5649>
<t5650>––By marrying your nephew, I would not believe I am stepping out of my sphere.</t5650> <t5651>He is a gentleman, and I am the daughter of another gentleman; therefore, we are equals.</t5651>
<t5652>––That's right; you are the daughter of a gentleman.</t5652> <t5653>But, who is your mother?</t5653> <t5654>Who are your uncles and aunts?</t5654> <t5655>Do you think I am unaware of your status?</t5655>
<t5656>––Whatever my relatives may be, if your nephew has nothing to say about them, you have even less to say ––replied Elizabeth.</t5656>
<t5657>Tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him?</t5657>
<t5658>Although merely out of the desire to be thanked by Lady Catherine, Elizabeth would not have answered her question; she could not help but say, after a moment of deliberation:</t5658>
<t5659>––I'm not.</t5659>
<t5660>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.</t5660>
<t5661>––And do you promise me never to make such a commitment?</t5661>
<t5662>––I will not make any such promise.</t5662> <t5663>Miss Bennet! I am horrified and astonished!</t5663> <t5664>I expected you to be more sensible.</t5664> <t5665>But do not delude yourself: I do not intend to yield.</t5665> <t5666>I will not leave until you have given me the assurance I demand.</t5666>
<t5667>––Well, the truth is that I will never give it to her.</t5667> <t5668>Do not think that I will be intimidated by such a ridiculous thing.</t5668> <t5669>What Your Ladyship wants is for Darcy to marry your daughter; but if I made you the promise you desire, would that marriage be more likely?</t5669> <t5670>Suppose he is interested in me; if I refused to accept his hand, do you think he would offer it to his cousin?</t5670> <t5671>Allow me to tell you, Lady Catherine, that the arguments you have used to support your extraordinary demand have been as frivolous as the demand itself is thoughtless.</t5671> <t5672>You have greatly mistaken me if you think I can be convinced by such reasons.</t5672> <t5673>I do not know to what extent your nephew will approve of your interference in his affairs; but you certainly have no right to meddle in mine.</t5673> <t5674>Therefore, I beg you not to bother me any further on this matter.</t5674>
<t5675>––Do not rush, please, I have not finished yet.</t5675> <t5676>To all the objections I have raised, I must add one more.</t5676> <t5677>I am not unaware of the details of the infamous abduction of your younger sister.</t5677> <t5678>I know everything.</t5678> <t5679>I know that the boy married her thanks to an arrangement made between his father and his uncle.</t5679> <t5680>And that woman is to be my nephew's sister?</t5680> <t5681>And her husband, the son of your father's former steward, is to become Darcy's brother?</t5681> <t5682>For heaven's sake!</t5682> <t5683>What do you think?</t5683> <t5684>Are the ancestors of Pemberley to be desecrated in this way?</t5684>
<t5685>––You have already said it all ––replied Elizabeth indignantly––.</t5685> <t5686>You have insulted me in every possible way.</t5686> <t5687>I beg you, let us return home.</t5687>
<t5688>And upon saying this, he stood up.</t5688> <t5689>Lady Catherine stood up as well and they returned.</t5689> <t5690>Her Ladyship was in a rage.</t5690>
<t5691>––So, you have no regard for the honor and reputation of my nephew?</t5691> <t5692>You insensitive and selfish creature!</t5692> <t5693>Don't you realize that if he marries you, he will be discredited in the eyes of everyone?</t5693>
<t5694>Lady Catherine, I have nothing more to say.</t5694> <t5695>You already know what I think.</t5695>
<t5696>––Are you, then, determined to achieve it?</t5696>
<t5697>––I have not said such a thing. I am only determined to act in the way that I believe is most convenient for my happiness without taking you or anyone who has so little to do with me into account.</t5697>
<t5698>––Very well.</t5698> <t5699>Then you refuse to please me.</t5699> <t5700>You refuse to obey the command of duty, honor, and gratitude.</t5700> <t5701>You are determined to humiliate my nephew in front of all his friends and make him the laughingstock of everyone.</t5701>
<t5702>––Neither duty, nor honor, nor gratitude ––replied Elizabeth––, can demand anything from me in the present circumstances.</t5702> <t5703>None of your principles would be violated by my marriage to Darcy.</t5703> <t5704>And as for the resentment of your family or the indignation of the world, if the former are enraged by my marriage to their nephew, I wouldn't care in the slightest; and the world would have enough good sense to join me in my disdain.</t5704>
<t5705>––And this is your attitude, your final resolution?</t5705> <t5706>Very well; I know what I have to do.</t5706> <t5707>Do not imagine that your ambition, Miss Bennet, will ever be satisfied.</t5707> <t5708>I came to test you.</t5708> <t5709>I hoped you would be a reasonable person.</t5709> <t5710>But rest assured that I will have my way.</t5710>
<t5711>Lady Catherine said all this until they reached the carriage door.</t5711> <t5712>Then she turned and said:</t5712>
<t5713>––I do not bid you farewell, Miss Bennet; I send no regards to your mother; you do not deserve such attention.</t5713> <t5714>You have gravely offended me.</t5714> <t5715>Elizabeth did not respond nor did she try to persuade Her Ladyship to come into the house.</t5715> <t5716>She left alone and slowly.</t5716> <t5717>As she was going up the stairs, she heard the carriage depart.</t5717> <t5718>Her mother, impatient, met her at the door of the dressing room to ask her why Lady Catherine had not come back to rest.</t5718>
<t5719>––He didn't want to ––said his daughter––.</t5719> <t5720>He has left.</t5720>
<t5721>––What a distinguished woman!</t5721> <t5722>And what courtesy on her part to come visit us!</t5722> <t5723>Because I suppose she has come to tell us that the Collinses are well.</t5723> <t5724>She must have been going somewhere and thought she could visit us while passing through Meryton.</t5724> <t5725>I suppose she didn't have anything particular to say to you, right, Lizzy?</t5725>
<t5726>Elizabeth was forced to tell a small lie, because uncovering the subject of her conversation was impossible.</t5726>
<t5727>CHAPTER LVII</t5727>
<t5728>Not without difficulty did Elizabeth manage to overcome the agitation caused by that extraordinary visit.</t5728> <t5729>She spent many hours unable to think of anything else.</t5729> <t5730>Apparently, Lady Catherine had taken the trouble to travel from Rosings to Hertfordshire with the sole purpose of breaking her supposed engagement with Darcy.</t5730> <t5731>Although Lady Catherine was very capable of such a project, Elizabeth could not imagine where she had gotten the news of said engagement, until she remembered that his being such a good friend of Bingley and she being Jane's sister could have given rise to the idea, since the marriage of one couple predisposed to suppose the marriage of the other.</t5731> <t5732>Elizabeth had indeed thought that her sister's marriage would bring her and Darcy closer together.</t5732> <t5733>That must have been why the Lucases—through whose correspondence with the Collinses Elizabeth presumed the conjecture had reached Lady Catherine's ears—considered immediate what she had also believed possible for later.</t5733>
<t5734>But upon reflecting on Lady Catherine's words, she could not avoid a certain uneasiness about the consequences that her interference might have.</t5734> <t5735>From what she said about her resolution to prevent the marriage, Elizabeth deduced that she intended to confront her nephew, and she did not know how Darcy would take the relation of the dangers that their union entailed.</t5735> <t5736>She was unaware of the extent of Darcy's affection for his aunt and how much he valued her opinion; but it was logical to suppose that he had more regard for Her Ladyship than she did, and she was sure that her aunt would touch a sore spot by enumerating the misfortunes of a marriage with a person from a family so unequal to his own.</t5736> <t5737>Given Darcy's ideas on that particular matter, Elizabeth believed it likely that the arguments that had seemed so weak and ridiculous to her might appear to him full of good sense and solid reasoning.</t5737>
<t5738>So if Darcy had hesitated before about what he had to do, which he often seemed to, the warnings and urgings of such a close relative might dispel all his doubts and incline him once and for all to be as happy as an immaculate dignity would allow him.</t5738> <t5739>In that case, Darcy would not return to Hertfordshire.</t5739> <t5740>Lady Catherine would see him as he passed through London, and the young man would rescind his commitment to Bingley to return to Netherfield.</t5740>
<t5741>"Therefore," Elizabeth said to herself, "if in a few days Bingley receives an excuse from Darcy for not coming, I will know what to expect.</t5741> <t5742>And then I will have to rid myself of all hope and illusion about his constancy.</t5742> <t5743>If he is content to lament my loss when he could have obtained my love and my hand, I too will soon cease to lament losing him."</t5743>
<t5744>The surprise of the rest of the family upon learning who the visitor had been was enormous; but they explained everything in the same way as Mrs. Bennet, and Elizabeth was spared having to mention her indignation.</t5744>
<t5745>The next morning, when coming down from his room, he met his father who was coming out of the library with a letter in his hand.</t5745>
<t5746>––Elizabeth ––he said to her––, I was looking for you.</t5746> <t5747>Come with me.</t5747>
<t5748>Elizabeth followed him and her curiosity to know what he had to communicate to her increased, thinking that it might be related to the previous day.</t5748> <t5749>Suddenly, it occurred to her that the letter could be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay what it might be about.</t5749>
<t5750>He went with his father to the fireplace and they both sat down.</t5750> <t5751>Then Mr. Bennet said:</t5751>
<t5752>––I received a letter this morning that left me flabbergasted.</t5752> <t5753>Since it mainly concerns you, you should know its contents.</t5753> <t5754>Until now, I didn't know that you had two daughters about to get married.</t5754> <t5755>Allow me to congratulate you on such an achievement.</t5755>
<t5756>Elizabeth was left stunned, believing that the letter was from the nephew instead of the aunt; and she wavered between being glad that Darcy was finally explaining himself, and being offended that he had not addressed the letter to her, when her father continued:</t5756>
<t5757>––It seems like you can guess it.</t5757> <t5758>You girls have great intuition for these matters.</t5758> <t5759>But I think I can challenge your shrewdness by daring you to discover the name of your admirer.</t5759> <t5760>The letter is from Collins.</t5760>
<t5761>––From Collins! And what does he have to say? ––As expected, something very timely.</t5761> <t5762>He begins with congratulations on the upcoming wedding of my eldest daughter, of which he seems to have been informed by one of the kind and talkative Lucases.</t5762> <t5763>I won't bore you by reading what he says about that point.</t5763> <t5764>What concerns you is the following:</t5764>
<t5765>After having congratulated you on behalf of Mrs. Collins and myself for such a fortunate event, allow me to add a brief warning about another matter, of which we have been informed through the same channel.</t5765> <t5766>It is assumed that your daughter Elizabeth will not bear the name Bennet for much longer once her elder sister has left it, and that the partner she has been fortunate enough to secure can reasonably be considered one of our most illustrious personalities.</t5766>
<t5767>––Can you guess, Lizzy, what this means?</t5767>
<t5768>That young man possesses everything one could desire in this world: superb properties, a distinguished family, and an extensive patronage.</t5768> <t5769>But despite all those temptations, allow me to warn my cousin Elizabeth and yourself of the dangers you may face with a hasty acceptance of the proposals of such a gentleman, which, naturally, you might be inclined to consider advantageous.</t5769>
<t5770>––Do you have no idea who the gentleman is, Elizabeth?</t5770> <t5771>He's coming now.</t5771>
<t5772>The reasons I have for informing you are as follows: your aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look favorably upon this marriage.</t5772>
<t5773>––As you see, the gentleman in question is Mr. Darcy.</t5773> <t5774>I believe, Elizabeth, that you must be stunned.</t5774> <t5775>Neither Collins nor the Lucases could have chosen a name from our circle of friends that better reveals that what they are spreading is a falsehood.</t5775> <t5776>Mr. Darcy, who only looks at a woman to criticize her, and who probably has never looked at you in his life!</t5776> <t5777>It's phenomenal!</t5777>
<t5778>Elizabeth tried to joke with her father, but her effort resulted in nothing more than a very timid smile.</t5778> <t5779>Her father's mood had never taken a more unpleasant turn for her.</t5779>
<t5780>––Didn't it amuse you?</t5780>
<t5781>––Of course! Keep reading.</t5781>
<t5782>When last night I mentioned to His Lordship the possibility of that marriage, with his usual condescension he expressed his opinion on the matter.</t5782> <t5783>If it were true, Lady Catherine would never give her consent to what she considers a most imprudent union due to certain objections to my cousin's family.</t5783> <t5784>I felt it my duty to communicate this as soon as possible to my cousin, so that she and her noble admirer know what is happening and do not rush into a marriage that has not been duly authorized.</t5784>
<t5785>And Mr. Collins, moreover, added:</t5785>
<t5786>I sincerely rejoice that the matter of your daughter Lydia has been resolved so well, and I only regret that the news spread that they were living together before the marriage had taken place.</t5786> <t5787>I cannot forget what I owe to my position by refraining from expressing my astonishment upon learning that you received the young couple when they were married.</t5787> <t5788>That was encouraging vice; and if I had been the rector of Longbourn, I would have resolutely opposed it.</t5788> <t5789>It is true that you must forgive them as a Christian, but not admit them into your presence nor allow their names to be mentioned before you.</t5789>
<t5790>––This is his concept of Christian forgiveness!</t5790> <t5791>The rest of the letter refers only to the state of his dear Charlotte, and his hope of having an offspring.</t5791> <t5792>But, Elizabeth, it seems that you have not been amused.</t5792> <t5793>I suppose you wouldn't get angry and take offense at this foolishness.</t5793> <t5794>What do we live for if not to entertain our neighbors and laugh at them in turn?</t5794>
<t5795>––Yes, I had a lot of fun ––exclaimed Elizabeth––.</t5795> <t5796>But it is so strange!</t5796>
<t5797>––Well, that's what makes it funnier.</t5797> <t5798>If they had thought of another man, it wouldn't be anything special; but Darcy's absolute indifference and the deep grudge you hold against him is what makes the joke.</t5798> <t5799>As much as it bothers me to write, I cannot do without Collins' correspondence.</t5799> <t5800>The truth is that when I read one of his letters, he seems superior to Wickham, despite the fact that I consider my son-in-law the epitome of shamelessness and hypocrisy.</t5800> <t5801>And tell me, Eliza, how did Lady Catherine take it?</t5801> <t5802>Did she come to deny you her consent?</t5802>
<t5803>To this question, Elizabeth responded with a laugh, and since her father had asked it without the slightest suspicion, she didn't mind ––that he repeated it.</t5803> <t5804>Elizabeth had never found herself in a situation where she had to pretend that her feelings were something they were not in reality.</t5804> <t5805>But now she had to laugh when she would have rather cried.</t5805> <t5806>Her father had cruelly hurt her by saying that about Darcy's indifference, and she couldn't help but marvel at her father's lack of intuition, or fear that instead of him having seen too little, she had seen too much.</t5806>
<t5807>CHAPTER LVIII</t5807>
<t5808>A few days after Lady Catherine's visit, Bingley not only did not receive any letter of excuse from his friend, but he also brought him to Longbourn in person.</t5808> <t5809>The gentlemen arrived early, and before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell Darcy that his aunt had come to visit them, which Elizabeth feared for a moment, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed that they all go for a walk.</t5809> <t5810>It was agreed upon, but Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking and Mary could not afford to waste time.</t5810> <t5811>So the remaining five went out.</t5811> <t5812>Bingley and Jane soon let the others go ahead and stayed behind.</t5812> <t5813>Elizabeth, Darcy, and Catherine walked together, but spoke very little.</t5813> <t5814>Catherine was too afraid of Darcy to chat; Elizabeth was making a desperate decision in her mind, and perhaps Darcy was doing the same.</t5814>
<t5815>They headed towards the Lucas' house because Catherine wanted to see Maria, and since Elizabeth thought this might interest her, when Catherine left them, she boldly continued walking alone with Darcy.</t5815> <t5816>Then the moment came to put her decision into practice, and summoning her courage, she immediately said:</t5816>
<t5817>––Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature who cares only for my own feelings, without thinking that I might hurt yours.</t5817> <t5818>But I can no longer go on without thanking you for your unparalleled kindness towards my poor sister.</t5818> <t5819>Since I found out, I have been longing to express my gratitude to you.</t5819> <t5820>If my family knew, they would have done so as well.</t5820>
<t5821>––I am very sorry ––replied Darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion–– that you have been informed of something that, if misinterpreted, could have caused you some unease.</t5821> <t5822>I did not think Mrs. Gardiner would be so indiscreet.</t5822>
<t5823>––Don't blame my aunt.</t5823> <t5824>Lydia's indiscretion was the first thing that revealed to me her involvement in the matter; and, naturally, I did not rest until I knew all the details.</t5824> <t5825>Let me thank you a thousand times, on behalf of my entire family, for the generous interest that led you to take so much trouble and endure so many mortifications to find the whereabouts of the two.</t5825>
<t5826>––If you wish to thank me ––replied Darcy––, do so only in your own name.</t5826> <t5827>I will not deny that the desire to ease your mind was added to the other reasons that drove me to do what I did; but your family owes me nothing.</t5827> <t5828>I have great respect for them, but I thought only of you.</t5828>
<t5829>Elizabeth was so confused that she couldn't speak.</t5829> <t5830>After a short pause, her companion added: "You are too generous to mock me."</t5830> <t5831>If your feelings are still the same as last April, tell me at once.</t5831> <t5832>My affection and desires have not changed, but with a single word from you, I will not insist any further.</t5832>
<t5833>Elizabeth, feeling clumsier and more distressed than ever in Darcy's presence, made an effort to speak immediately, though not quickly, and conveyed to him that her feelings had undergone such an absolute change since the time he referred to, that she now received his proposals with pleasure and gratitude.</t5833> <t5834>The happiness that this response brought to Darcy was the greatest of his life, and he expressed it with all the warmth and tenderness that can be expected from a man madly in love.</t5834> <t5835>If Elizabeth had been able to look him in the eyes, she would have seen how well the delight that flooded his heart was reflected in them; but she could listen to him, and the feelings that Darcy confessed to her, which demonstrated the importance she had for him, made her affection increasingly valuable.</t5835>
<t5836>They continued walking without worrying about the direction they were taking.</t5836> <t5837>They had too much to think about, to feel, and to say to pay attention to anything else.</t5837> <t5838>Elizabeth immediately knew that they owed their closeness to Darcy's aunt's efforts, who visited him in London upon his return and told him about her trip to Longbourn, the motives behind it, and the substance of her conversation with the young woman, emphatically highlighting the expressions that, in Her Ladyship's opinion, denoted Elizabeth's perversity and brazenness, confident that this account would help her in her endeavor to extract from her nephew the promise that Elizabeth had refused to give her.</t5838> <t5839>But unfortunately for Her Ladyship, the effect was counterproductive.</t5839>
<t5840>––Thanks to that, I conceived hopes that I would hardly have dared to formulate before.</t5840> <t5841>I knew your character well enough to know that if you had been absolutely and irrevocably decided against me, you would have told Lady Catherine with complete clarity and frankness.</t5841>
<t5842>Elizabeth blushed and laughed, replying:</t5842>
<t5843>––Yes, you knew my frankness well enough to believe me capable of that.</t5843> <t5844>After having rejected you so odiously to your face, I could have no qualms about saying the same to all your relatives.</t5844>
<t5845>––He didn't tell me anything I didn't deserve.</t5845> <t5846>His accusations were unfounded, but my conduct towards you deserved the most severe reproach.</t5846> <t5847>That was unforgivable; it horrifies me to think about it.</t5847>
<t5848>––We are not going to argue about who was worse that afternoon ––said Elizabeth––.</t5848> <t5849>Looking at it closely, we both had our faults.</t5849> <t5850>But it seems to me that we have both gained in courtesy since then.</t5850>
<t5851>––I cannot reconcile with myself so easily.</t5851> <t5852>The memory of what I said and did on that occasion is and will be very painful for me for a long time.</t5852> <t5853>I cannot forget her very accurate phrase: «If you had behaved more gentlemanly.»</t5853> <t5854>Those were her words.</t5854> <t5855>You don't know, you can't imagine how much they have tortured me, although I confess that it took me a while to be reasonable enough to recognize the truth they contained.</t5855>
<t5856>––Believe me, I was far from imagining that they could cause such a bad impression on you.</t5856> <t5857>I had no idea that they would distress you in that way.</t5857>
<t5858>––I don't doubt it.</t5858> <t5859>Then you assumed I was devoid of any elevated feelings, I'm sure.</t5859> <t5860>I will also never forget your expression when you told me that no matter how I had approached you, you would not have accepted me.</t5860>
<t5861>––Do not repeat all my words from that day.</t5861> <t5862>We must erase that memory.</t5862> <t5863>I swear to you that I have been sincerely ashamed of that for a long time.</t5863>
<t5864>Darcy spoke to her about his letter:</t5864>
<t5865>––Did it make you change your opinion about me?</t5865> <t5866>Did you believe its content?</t5866>
<t5867>She explained to him the effect it had had on her and how her previous prejudices had gradually disappeared.</t5867>
<t5868>––I already knew ––continued Darcy–– that what I wrote had to sadden you, but it was necessary.</t5868> <t5869>I suppose you have destroyed the letter.</t5869> <t5870>There was a part, especially at the beginning, that I would not want you to read again.</t5870> <t5871>I remember certain expressions that could make you hate me.</t5871>
<t5872>––We will burn the letter if you believe it is necessary to preserve my affection, but although we both have reasons to think that my opinions are not entirely unchangeable, they do not change as easily as you suppose.</t5872>
<t5873>––When I wrote that letter ––Darcy replied, I believed myself to be perfectly calm and composed; but later I realized that I had written it in a state of tremendous bitterness.</t5873>
<t5874>––It may have started with bitterness, but it didn't end the same way.</t5874> <t5875>The farewell was very affectionate.</t5875> <t5876>But don't think about the letter anymore.</t5876> <t5877>The feelings of the person who wrote it and those of the person who received it are now so different that all the unpleasant circumstances related to it should be forgotten.</t5877> <t5878>You must learn my philosophy.</t5878> <t5879>From the past, you only need to remember what was pleasant.</t5879>
<t5880>––I cannot believe in that philosophy of yours.</t5880><t5881>Your memories must be so free from any reproach that the satisfaction they bring you does not come from philosophy, but from something better: the tranquility of conscience.</t5881><t5882>But with me, it is different: I am confronted by painful memories that cannot and should not be driven away.</t5882><t5883>I have been a selfish person all my life in practice, though not in principles.</t5883><t5884>As a child, I was taught to think well, but not to correct my temperament.</t5884><t5885>I was instilled with good norms, but they allowed me to follow them laden with pride and presumption.</t5885><t5886>Unfortunately, I was an only child for several years, and my parents, who were good in themselves, particularly my father, who was the personification of kindness and love, allowed me, indulged me, and almost guided me towards selfishness and authoritarianism, towards indifference to everything that was not my own family, towards disdain for the rest of the world or, at least, to believe that the intelligence and merits of others were far inferior to mine.</t5886><t5887>Thus, from the age of eight to twenty-eight, and it would still be so if it were not for you, dearest Elizabeth.</t5887><t5888>I owe you everything.</t5888><t5889>You gave me a lesson that was, indeed, very hard at first, but also very beneficial.</t5889><t5890>You humbled me as was fitting, you showed me how insufficient my pretensions were to flatter a woman who deserves all the flattery.</t5890>
<t5891>––Did you think I was going to accept it?</t5891>
<t5892>––Of course.</t5892> <t5893>What do you think of my vanity?</t5893> <t5894>I thought you were expecting and desiring my declaration.</t5894>
<t5895>––I behaved badly, but it was unintentional.</t5895> <t5896>I never meant to deceive him, and yet many times I</t5896>
<t5897>mistake.</t5897> <t5898>How she must have hated me after that afternoon!</t5898>
<t5899>––Hate her!</t5899> <t5900>Maybe I was resentful at first; but the resentment soon turned into something better.</t5900>
<t5901>––I hardly dare ask you what you thought upon finding me at Pemberley.</t5901> <t5902>Did you think it was wrong of me to have gone?</t5902>
<t5903>––None of that.</t5903> <t5904>I was just surprised.</t5904>
<t5905>––Your surprise would not be greater than mine upon seeing you greet me.</t5905> <t5906>I did not believe I had the right to your attentions and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than what I deserved.</t5906>
<t5907>––I set out ––Darcy replied–– to demonstrate to you, with my utmost courtesy, that I was not so vile as to be hurt by the past, and I hoped to earn your forgiveness and mitigate the poor opinion you had of me by proving that I had not disregarded your reproaches.</t5907> <t5908>It is difficult for me to tell you how long it took for these other desires to mix in, but I believe it was about half an hour after having seen you.</t5908>
<t5909>Then he explained to her how delighted Georgiana had been to meet her and how much she regretted the sudden interruption of their friendship.</t5909> <t5910>This naturally led them to discuss the cause of said interruption, and Elizabeth learned that Darcy had decided to leave Derbyshire in search of Lydia before leaving the inn, and that his seriousness and pensive appearance were due to no other thoughts than those inherent to the aforementioned project.</t5910>
<t5911>Elizabeth thanked him again, but the matter was too overwhelming for both of them, and they did not pursue it further.</t5911>
<t5912>After walking several miles in complete abandonment and too busy to care about anything else, they looked at their watches and saw that it was time to go back home.</t5912>
<t5913>––What could have become of Bingley and Jane?</t5913>
<t5914>This exclamation led them to talk about each other's affairs.</t5914> <t5915>Darcy was very happy with his engagement, which Bingley had immediately informed him about.</t5915>
<t5916>––Can I ask you if it surprised you? ––said Elizabeth.</t5916>
<t5917>––By no means.</t5917> <t5918>When I left, I realized that the matter was imminent.</t5918>
<t5919>––That is to say, you gave him your permission.</t5919> <t5920>I already suspected it.</t5920>
<t5921>And although he protested such terms, she found them to be very appropriate.</t5921>
<t5922>––The evening before my trip to London ––said Darcy–– I made a confession to him that I should have made long before.</t5922> <t5923>I told him everything that had happened to make my interference absurd and impertinent.</t5923> <t5924>He was left speechless.</t5924> <t5925>He had never suspected anything.</t5925> <t5926>I also told him that I had been mistaken in assuming that Jane did not love him, and when I realized that Bingley still loved her, I no longer doubted that they would be happy.</t5926>
<t5927>Elizabeth couldn't help but smile upon seeing how easily she managed her friend.</t5927>
<t5928>––When you told him that my sister loved him, was it because you had observed it or because I had confessed it to you last spring?</t5928>
<t5929>––For the first part.</t5929> <t5930>I observed her carefully during the two visits I made to her recently, and I became convinced of her affection for Bingley.</t5930>
<t5931>––And his conviction also left him convinced, right?</t5931>
<t5932>––That's right.</t5932> <t5933>Bingley is the most modest and least conceited man in the world.</t5933> <t5934>His timidity prevented him from trusting his own judgment in such an important matter;</t5934> <t5935>but his submission to mine settled everything.</t5935> <t5936>I had to tell him something that for a time, and quite rightly, had him very upset.</t5936> <t5937>I couldn't hide from him that his sister had been in London for three months last winter, that I knew it, and that I didn't tell him on purpose.</t5937> <t5938>He was very angry.</t5938> <t5939>But I'm sure he got over it when he was convinced that his sister still loved him.</t5939> <t5940>Now he has forgiven me wholeheartedly.</t5940>
<t5941>Elizabeth would have liked to add that Bingley was the most wonderful of friends for the ease with which he could be brought and taken, and that he was truly invaluable.</t5941> <t5942>But she restrained herself.</t5942> <t5943>She remembered that Darcy still had to learn to laugh at these things, and that it was too soon to start.</t5943> <t5944>Speculating about Bingley's happiness which, of course, could only be inferior to theirs, Darcy kept talking until they reached the house.</t5944> <t5945>They said goodbye in the hall.</t5945>
<t5946>CHAPTER LIX</t5946>
<t5947>Elizabeth, dear, where have you been walking?</t5947>
<t5948>This is the question that Jane directed to Elizabeth as soon as they were in their room, and the one that everyone else asked when they sat down at the table.</t5948> <t5949>Elizabeth replied that they had been wandering until they reached the end of the path she knew.</t5949> <t5950>As she said this, she blushed, but neither this nor anything else aroused the slightest suspicion about the truth.</t5950>
<t5951>The evening passed quietly without anything extraordinary happening.</t5951> <t5952>The official couples chatted and laughed, while the unofficial ones remained silent.</t5952> <t5953>Darcy's happiness never overflowed into joy; Elizabeth, agitated and confused, knew she was happy more than she felt it, for besides her immediate bewilderment, other things worried her.</t5953> <t5954>She foresaw the commotion that would arise in the family when they learned what had happened.</t5954> <t5955>She knew that no one in her household liked Darcy more than Jane did, and she even feared that neither his fortune nor his position would be enough to satisfy them.</t5955>
<t5956>At night, she opened her heart to Jane, and although Jane was not naturally suspicious, she could not believe what her sister was telling her:</t5956>
<t5957>––You're joking, Eliza!</t5957> <t5958>That can't be! You, engaged to Darcy!</t5958> <t5959>No, no; you won't fool me.</t5959> <t5960>I know it's impossible.</t5960>
<t5961>––Well, this is off to a bad start!</t5961> <t5962>I only trusted you, but if you don't believe me, others will believe me even less.</t5962> <t5963>I'm telling you the absolute truth.</t5963> <t5964>Darcy still loves me and we are engaged.</t5964>
<t5965>Jane looked at her hesitantly:</t5965>
<t5966>––Elizabeth, it is not possible.</t5966> <t5967>But I know you can't even stand him!</t5967>
<t5968>––You know nothing at all.</t5968> <t5969>We have to forget all that.</t5969> <t5970>Maybe I haven't always loved him as I do now; but in these cases, a good memory is unforgivable.</t5970> <t5971>This is the last time I remember it.</t5971>
<t5972>Jane contemplated her sister with astonishment.</t5972> <t5973>Elizabeth reaffirmed with the utmost seriousness that what she was saying was true.</t5973>
<t5974>––Heavens! Is it possible?</t5974> <t5975>Really?</t5975> <t5976>But now I believe you ––exclaimed Jane––.</t5976> <t5977>Dear Elizabeth!</t5977> <t5978>I would congratulate you, I do congratulate you, but... are you sure, and forgive the question, completely sure that you will be happy with him?</t5978>
<t5979>––Without a doubt.</t5979> <t5980>We have already agreed that we will be the happiest couple on earth.</t5980> <t5981>Are you happy, Jane? Will you like having Darcy as a brother?</t5981>
<t5982>––A lot, very much, it is what can give Bingley and me the most pleasure.</t5982> <t5983>And you, do you really love him enough? Oh, Elizabeth!</t5983> <t5984>Do anything but marry without love.</t5984> <t5985>Are you absolutely sure that you feel what you should feel?</t5985>
<t5986>––Oh, yes!</t5986> <t5987>And you will be convinced that I feel more than I should when I have told you everything.</t5987>
<t5988>––What do you mean?</t5988>
<t5989>––Well, I must confess to you that I love him more than you love Bingley.</t5989> <t5990>I fear that you will be upset.</t5990>
<t5991>––Sister, dear, you can't be serious.</t5991> <t5992>Tell me one thing I need to know right now: since when have you loved him?</t5992>
<t5993>––That love has come to me so gradually that I hardly know when it began; but I believe it dates back to the first time I saw his beautiful Pemberley estate.</t5993>
<t5994>Jane once again asked for formality and Elizabeth then spoke solemnly, affirming that she adored Darcy.</t5994> <t5995>Jane was convinced and was entirely satisfied.</t5995>
<t5996>––Now I am completely happy ––he said––, because you are going to be as happy as I am.</t5996> <t5997>I have always had great esteem for Darcy.</t5997> <t5998>Even if it were only for his love for you, I would have to love him; but now that in addition to being Bingley's friend, he will be your husband, I will love only Bingley and you more than him.</t5998> <t5999>But how quiet and reserved you have been with me!</t5999> <t6000>Why didn't you tell me what happened at Pemberley and in Lambton?</t6000> <t6001>I had to learn everything from someone else and not from you.</t6001>
<t6002>Elizabeth explained to her the reasons for her secrecy.</t6002> <t6003>She had not wanted to mention Bingley, and the indecision of her own feelings made her avoid also mentioning the name of his friend.</t6003> <t6004>But now she did not want to hide Darcy's intervention in the matter of Lydia.</t6004> <t6005>Everything was clarified, and the two sisters spent half the night talking.</t6005>
<t6006>––Oh, I hope that disagreeable Mr. Darcy doesn't come again with our dear Bingley! ––sighed Mrs. Bennet as she looked out the window the next day––.</t6006> <t6007>Why is he so bothersome and comes here continuously?</t6007> <t6008>He could go hunting or do anything else instead of coming to bother us.</t6008> <t6009>How could we get rid of him?</t6009> <t6010>Elizabeth, you'll have to go for a walk with him again so he doesn't bother Bingley.</t6010>
<t6011>Elizabeth almost burst into laughter upon hearing that interesting proposition, despite the fact that it hurt her that her mother was always insulting her.</t6011>
<t6012>As soon as the two gentlemen entered, Bingley looked at Elizabeth expressively and shook her hand with such ardor that the young woman understood that he already knew everything.</t6012> <t6013>Shortly after, Bingley said:</t6013>
<t6014>Mr. Bennet, don't you have any other paths where Elizabeth might get lost again today?</t6014>
<t6015>––I recommend Mr. Darcy, Lizzy, and Kitty ––said Mrs. Bennet–– to go this morning to Oagham Mountain.</t6015> <t6016>It is a long and beautiful walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen that view.</t6016>
<t6017>––This might be fine for the other two ––explained Bingley––, but it seems to me that Catherine would get tired.</t6017> <t6018>Right?</t6018>
<t6019>The girl confessed that she would prefer to stay at home; Darcy expressed great curiosity to enjoy the view of that mountain, and Elizabeth agreed to accompany him.</t6019> <t6020>When she went up to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her to say:</t6020>
<t6021>––Lizzy, I'm very sorry that you are forced to be with such an unpleasant person; but I hope you do it for Jane.</t6021> <t6022>Besides, you only have to talk to her occasionally.</t6022> <t6023>Don't trouble yourself too much.</t6023>
<t6024>During the walk, they decided that that very afternoon they would ask for the father's consent.</t6024> <t6025>Elizabeth reserved for herself the task of informing the mother.</t6025> <t6026>She could not imagine how she would take it; sometimes she doubted whether all of Darcy's wealth and lineage would be enough to counteract the hatred she harbored for him; but whether she opposed the marriage violently or approved of it with equal vehemence, there was no doubt that her outbursts would not be any indication of good sense, and for that reason, she could not bear for Darcy to witness either the first raptures of joy or the initial expressions of disapproval.</t6026>
<t6027>In the afternoon, shortly after Mr. Bennet had retired to his library, Elizabeth saw Darcy rise and follow him.</t6027> <t6028>Her heart began to beat strongly.</t6028> <t6029>She did not fear that her father would oppose, but it would grieve him greatly, and the fact that it was she, his favorite daughter, who was causing him such distress and who would inspire him with so much care and sorrow with her unfortunate choice, made Elizabeth very sad.</t6029> <t6030>She was very downcast until Darcy re-entered and, upon looking at him, his smile gave her encouragement.</t6030> <t6031>A few minutes later, Darcy approached the table where Elizabeth was sitting with Catherine, and pretending to look at her work, he whispered in her ear:</t6031>
<t6032>––Go see your father: he needs you in the library.</t6032>
<t6033>Elizabeth dashed out.</t6033>
<t6034>His father was pacing around the room and seemed very serious and restless.</t6034>
<t6035>––Elizabeth ––he said––, what are you going to do?</t6035> <t6036>Are you in your right mind to accept that man?</t6036> <t6037>Didn't we agree that you hated him?</t6037>
<t6038>How Elizabeth regretted that her first impression of Darcy had been so unjust and her expressions so immoderate!</t6038> <t6039>Thus, she would have spared herself certain explanations and confessions that caused her great embarrassment, but which were unavoidable.</t6039> <t6040>Quite confused, Elizabeth assured her father that she loved Darcy deeply.</t6040>
<t6041>––In other words, you are determined to marry him.</t6041> <t6042>He is rich, that's true; you will be able to have better clothes and better cars than Jane.</t6042> <t6043>But will all that make you happy?</t6043>
<t6044>––Is your only objection that you think I don't love him?</t6044>
<t6045>––No more, no less.</t6045> <t6046>We all know he is a proud and unpleasant man; but this doesn't matter if you like him.</t6046>
<t6047>––Well, yes, I like him ––replied Elizabeth with tears in her eyes––; I love him.</t6047> <t6048>Besides, he has no pride.</t6048> <t6049>He is the kindest person in the world.</t6049> <t6050>You do not know him.</t6050> <t6051>That is why I beg you not to hurt me by talking about him in that way.</t6051>
<t6052>––Elizabeth ––added her father––, I have given my consent.</t6052> <t6053>He is one of those men, moreover, to whom you would never dare deny anything they condescended to ask of you.</t6053> <t6054>If you are determined to marry him, I also give you my consent.</t6054> <t6055>But let me warn you to think it over carefully.</t6055> <t6056>I know your character, Lizzy.</t6056> <t6057>I know that you will never be happy or prudent if you do not truly appreciate your husband, if you do not consider him as a superior.</t6057> <t6058>The liveliness of your talent would put you in the gravest of dangers if you made an unequal marriage.</t6058> <t6059>You could hardly save yourself from discredit and catastrophe.</t6059> <t6060>My daughter, do not give me the distress of seeing you incapable of respecting your life partner.</t6060> <t6061>You do not know what that is.</t6061>
<t6062>Elizabeth, more moved than her father, responded with vehemence and solemnity; and in the end, she managed to overcome her father's disbelief by reiterating the sincerity of her love for Darcy, explaining the gradual change that had occurred in her feelings for him, assuring him that Darcy's affection was not a fleeting thing, but had withstood the test of many months, and energetically listing all his good qualities.</t6062> <t6063>To the point that Mr. Bennet approved the marriage without reservations.</t6063>
<t6064>––Well, dear ––he said to her when she finished speaking––, I have nothing more to say to you.</t6064> <t6065>In that case, it is worthy of you.</t6065> <t6066>My Lizzy, I would not have given you to anyone who was worth less.</t6066>
<t6067>To complete the favorable impression of her father, Elizabeth recounted to him what Darcy had spontaneously done for Lydia.</t6067>
<t6068>––This is truly an afternoon of astonishment!</t6068> <t6069>So Darcy did everything: arranged the marriage, gave the money, paid the young man's debts, and secured his position?</t6069> <t6070>Better: this way I'll be free from a sea of confusions and accounts.</t6070> <t6071>If your uncle had done it, I would have had to pay him; but these young and passionate lovers take care of everything.</t6071> <t6072>Tomorrow I will offer to pay him; he will protest and make a scene invoking his love for you, and the matter will be settled.</t6072>
<t6073>Then Mr. Bennet remembered how badly Elizabeth had felt while he was reading Collins' letter to her, and after joking with her for a while, he let her go and said as she was leaving the room:</t6073>
<t6074>––If any boy comes for Mary or Catherine, send him to me, as I am completely unoccupied.</t6074>
<t6075>Elizabeth felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off her shoulders, and after half an hour of quiet reflection in her room, she found herself ready to join the others, quite calm.</t6075> <t6076>Things were too recent to give in to joy, but the afternoon passed in the utmost serenity.</t6076> <t6077>She had nothing to fear, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in due time.</t6077>
<t6078>When her mother retired to her room at night, Elizabeth went in with her and made the important communication.</t6078> <t6079>The effect was extraordinary, because at first Mrs. Bennet remained absolutely motionless, unable to articulate a word; and it was only after many minutes that she could comprehend what she had heard, despite the fact that she was usually not very reluctant to believe anything that meant some advantage for her family or a courtship for one of her daughters.</t6079> <t6080>Finally, she began to recover and become agitated.</t6080> <t6081>She would stand up and sit back down.</t6081> <t6082>She marveled and congratulated herself:</t6082>
<t6083>––Heavens! God bless me!</t6083> <t6084>What are you saying, dear daughter? Mr. Darcy?</t6084> <t6085>Who would have thought!</t6085> <t6086>Oh, my dear Eliza!</t6086> <t6087>How rich and important you will be!</t6087> <t6088>What a fortune, what jewels, what carriages you will have!</t6088> <t6089>Jane's situation is nothing in comparison, truly nothing.</t6089> <t6090>How happy I am, how delighted!</t6090> <t6091>What a charming man, so handsome, so well-built!</t6091> <t6092>Lizzy, my dear, forgive me for finding him so disagreeable before!</t6092> <t6093>I hope he forgives me too.</t6093> <t6094>Elizabeth, my heart!</t6094> <t6095>A house in the capital!</t6095> <t6096>Everything desirable!</t6096> <t6097>Three daughters married!</t6097> <t6098>Ten thousand pounds a year! My goodness! What will become of me? I'm going to go mad!</t6098>
<t6099>This was enough to prove that his approval was undeniable.</t6099> <t6100>Elizabeth, delighted that those effusions had been heard only by her, left immediately.</t6100> <t6101>But she had not been in her room for three minutes when her mother came in.</t6101>
<t6102>––Daughter of my heart! ––he exclaimed.</t6102> <t6103>I can't think of anything else.</t6103> <t6104>Ten thousand pounds a year and maybe more!</t6104> <t6105>He's worth as much as a lord!</t6105> <t6106>And a special license, because you must get married with a special license.</t6106> <t6107>My dear, tell me what dish Darcy likes the most so I can prepare it for him tomorrow.</t6107>
<t6108>This was a bad omen for what Mrs. Bennet's behavior towards the gentleman in question was going to be, and Elizabeth understood that despite having Darcy's ardent love and the consent of her entire family, something was still missing.</t6108> <t6109>But the next morning went better than she had thought, because, fortunately, her future son-in-law instilled such fear in Mrs. Bennet that she did not dare speak to him except when she could pay him some attention or agree with what he said.</t6109>
<t6110>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing that her father was making an effort to become close with him, and he assured her, to top it off, that he liked him more each day.</t6110>
<t6111>CHAPTER LX</t6111>
<t6112>Elizabeth soon regained her cheerfulness, and she wanted Darcy to tell her how he had fallen in love with her:</t6112>
<t6113>––How did it all start? ––he said to her––.</t6113> <t6114>I understand that once you were on the path you kept going, but what was the first moment you liked me?</t6114>
<t6115>––I cannot pinpoint the hour, nor the place, nor the look, nor the words that laid the foundations of my love.</t6115> <t6116>It was quite some time ago.</t6116> <t6117>I was already half in love with you before I knew that I wanted you.</t6117>
<t6118>––Well, my beauty hardly moved you.</t6118> <t6119>And as for my manners with you, they bordered on rudeness.</t6119> <t6120>I never spoke to you except to annoy you.</t6120> <t6121>Be honest: did you admire me for my impertinence?</t6121>
<t6122>––For your vigor and your intelligence.</t6122>
<t6123>––You can call it impertinence, for it was little less than that.</t6123> <t6124>The truth is that you were fed up with courtesies, deferences, attentions.</t6124> <t6125>You were annoyed by women who spoke only to attract you.</t6125> <t6126>I irritated and interested you because I didn't seem like them.</t6126> <t6127>That's why, if you hadn't actually been so affable, you would have hated me; but despite the effort you took to hide it, your feelings were noble and just, and deep down you completely despised the people who so assiduously courted you.</t6127> <t6128>See how I have spared you the trouble of explaining it to me.</t6128> <t6129>And, the truth is, after all, I'm beginning to think that it's perfectly reasonable.</t6129> <t6130>I'm sure that now you don't find any merit in me, but no one notices that when they fall in love.</t6130>
<t6131>––Was there no merit in your affectionate behavior towards Jane when she fell ill at Netherfield?</t6131>
<t6132>––My dear Jane!</t6132> <t6133>Anyone would have done the same for her.</t6133> <t6134>But interpret it as a virtue, if you wish.</t6134> <t6135>My good qualities belong to you now, and you can exaggerate them as much as you like.</t6135> <t6136>On the other hand, it is my duty to find occasions to contradict you and argue with you as often as I can.</t6136> <t6137>So I am going to start right now.</t6137> <t6138>Why did you take so long to talk to me about your feelings again?</t6138> <t6139>Why were you so shy when you first came and then when you had dinner with us?</t6139> <t6140>Why, especially, while you were at home, did you behave as if I didn't matter to you at all?</t6140>
<t6141>––Because I saw you serious and silent, and you didn't encourage me.</t6141>
<t6142>––She was very violent.</t6142>
<t6143>––And me too.</t6143>
<t6144>––You could have talked to me more when you came to eat.</t6144>
<t6145>––If I had been less moved, I would have done it.</t6145>
<t6146>––What a pity that you always have a reasonable answer, and that I am also so reasonable to accept it!</t6146> <t6147>But if you had had to decide, we would still be waiting.</t6147> <t6148>When would you have told me something, if it is not I who starts?</t6148> <t6149>My decision to thank you for what you did for Lydia had a good effect; too much: I am scared; because how does morality stand if our happiness sprang from the breach of a promise?</t6149> <t6150>I should not have spoken about that, I will not do it again.</t6150>
<t6151>––Don't torment yourself.</t6151> <t6152>Morality will remain completely intact.</t6152> <t6153>Lady Catherine's unclassifiable behavior to separate us was what dispelled all my doubts.</t6153> <t6154>I do not owe my current happiness to your vehement desire to express your gratitude to me.</t6154> <t6155>I did not need you to tell me anything.</t6155> <t6156>My aunt's account had given me hope and I was determined to know everything at once.</t6156>
<t6157>––Lady Catherine has been, therefore, infinitely useful to us, something that should delight her as she loves being useful to everyone.</t6157> <t6158>But tell me, why did you return to Netherfield?</t6158> <t6159>Was it only to come to Longbourn to torment yourself, or did you think of achieving a more serious outcome?</t6159>
<t6160>––My true purpose was to see you and to find out if I could still hope that you loved me.</t6160> <t6161>What I was confessing or confessing to myself was to see if your sister still cared for Bingley, and, if so, to reiterate the confession I had already made to him once before.</t6161>
<t6162>––Will you have the courage to inform Lady Catherine of what awaits her?</t6162>
<t6163>––Maybe I'm more short on time than courage.</t6163> <t6164>Let's do it right now.</t6164> <t6165>If you give me a sheet of paper, I'll do it immediately.</t6165>
<t6166>––And if I didn't have to write another letter, I could sit by your side and admire the uniformity of your handwriting, as a certain young lady did on another occasion.</t6166> <t6167>But I have an aunt whom I don't want to leave forgotten for any longer.</t6167>
<t6168>For not wanting to confess that they had exaggerated their intimacy with Darcy, Elizabeth had not yet replied to Mrs. Gardiner's long letter.</t6168> <t6169>But now, being able to announce to them what would be so well received, she almost felt ashamed that her uncles had missed out on three days of enjoying that news.</t6169> <t6170>Her letter was as follows:</t6170>
<t6171>Dear Aunt,</t6171>
<t6172>I would have thanked you earlier, as was my duty, for your extensive, kind, and satisfactory description of the event you know about; but you will understand that I was too distressed to do so.</t6172> <t6173>Your suppositions went beyond reality.</t6173> <t6174>But now you can suppose whatever you please, you can let your imagination run wild, you can allow your fancy to fly freely, and you will not be more mistaken than if you imagine that I am already married.</t6174> <t6175>You must write to me soon and praise Darcy much more than you did in your last letter.</t6175> <t6176>I thank God a thousand times over for not having gone to the Lakes.</t6176> <t6177>What folly on my part to have desired it!</t6177> <t6178>Your idea of the ponies is magnificent; every day we will tour the estate.</t6178> <t6179>I am the happiest creature in the world.</t6179> <t6180>Perhaps others have said it before, but no one with as much justice.</t6180> <t6181>I am even happier than Jane.</t6181> <t6182>She only smiles.</t6182> <t6183>I laugh out loud.</t6183> <t6184>Darcy sends you all the love he can spare from me.</t6184> <t6185>You will all come to Pemberley for Christmas.</t6185>
<t6186>Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was different.</t6186> <t6187>And even more different was the one Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins in response to his last one:</t6187>
<t6188>Dear sir,</t6188>
<t6189>I have to trouble you once more with the matter of congratulations: Elizabeth will soon be Mr. Darcy's wife.</t6189> <t6190>Console Lady Catherine as best as you can; but if I were you, I would stick with the nephew.</t6190> <t6191>He has more to offer.</t6191>
<t6192>I greet you attentively.</t6192>
<t6193>The congratulations from Miss Bingley to her brother on the occasion of his upcoming wedding were very affectionate, but not sincere.</t6193> <t6194>She also wrote to Jane to express her joy and to repeat her previous expressions of affection.</t6194> <t6195>Jane was not deceived, but she felt moved, and although she did not trust her, she could not help but send a reply much kinder than she thought she deserved.</t6195> <t6196>The joy that Miss Darcy felt upon hearing the news was as genuine as her brother's when he communicated it to her.</t6196> <t6197>She sent a four-page letter that still seemed insufficient to express all her satisfaction and her strong desire to gain her sister's affection.</t6197>
<t6198>Before any response from Collins or congratulations from his wife to Elizabeth arrived, the Longbourn family learned that the Collinses were coming to the Lucas' house.</t6198> <t6199>The reason for such a sudden move was soon known.</t6199> <t6200>Lady Catherine had become so furious upon receiving her nephew's letter that Charlotte, who was genuinely happy about the wedding, wanted to leave until the storm subsided.</t6200> <t6201>The arrival of her friend at that moment was a great pleasure for Elizabeth; although during their meetings this pleasure diminished when she saw Darcy exposed to Collins' pompous courtesy.</t6201> <t6202>But Darcy endured it all with admirable serenity.</t6202> <t6203>He even attended to Sir William Lucas when he came to congratulate him on winning the brightest jewel of the county and expressed his hopes that they would all meet at St. James.</t6203> <t6204>Darcy shrugged, but only when Sir William could no longer see him.</t6204>
<t6205>The vulgarity of Mrs. Philips was another and perhaps the greatest of the contributions imposed on her patience, for although this lady, like her sister, had too much respect for her to speak to her with the familiarity that Bingley's good humor allowed, she could not open her mouth without saying something vulgar.</t6205> <t6206>Not even that respect, which earned her a bit, managed to give her any elegance.</t6206> <t6207>Elizabeth did everything she could to protect him from everyone and always tried to keep him close to her or to the members of her family whose conversation did not mortify him.</t6207> <t6208>The annoyances that all this brought took away a good part of the pleasures of the courtship, but added greater hopes for the future.</t6208> <t6209>Elizabeth thought with delight about the future, when they would be away from that society so unpleasant for both of them and enjoying the comfort and elegance of their family gatherings at Pemberley.</t6209>
<t6210>CHAPTER LXI</t6210>
<t6211>The day Mrs. Bennet parted with her two best daughters was of great bliss for all her maternal feelings.</t6211> <t6212>One can imagine with what delightful pride she later visited Mrs. Bingley and spoke of Mrs. Darcy.</t6212> <t6213>I would like to say, for the sake of her family, that the fulfillment of her most fervent desires in seeing so many of her daughters well married had the happy effect of turning her into a sensible, kind, and judicious woman for the rest of her life; but perhaps it was a blessing for her husband (who would not have been able to enjoy the happiness of home in such an unusual form) that she remained occasionally nervous and invariably foolish.</t6213>
<t6214>Mr. Bennet missed his Elizabeth greatly; his affection for her drew him out of the house more frequently than anything else could have.</t6214> <t6215>He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when they least expected him.</t6215>
<t6216>Bingley and Jane stayed in Netherfield for only a year.</t6216> <t6217>The proximity of her mother and the relatives from Meryton was not desirable even considering Bingley's easygoing nature and Jane's loving heart.</t6217> <t6218>Then the golden dream of Bingley's sisters came true; he bought an estate in a county near Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, to their utmost happiness, were only thirty miles away.</t6218>
<t6219>Catherine, solely for her material interest, spent most of her time with her two older sisters; and by frequenting a society far superior to what she had always known, she made remarkable progress.</t6219> <t6220>Her temperament was not as indomitable as Lydia's, and away from her influence, she became, thanks to proper attention and guidance, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid.</t6220> <t6221>As was natural, she was carefully kept away from the previous disadvantages of Lydia's company, and although Mrs. Wickham invited her many times to her house, with the promise of dances and suitors, her father never consented to her going.</t6221>
<t6222>Mary was the only one who stayed in the house and was forced to stick close to Mrs. Bennet, who did not know how to be alone.</t6222> <t6223>For this reason, she had to mingle more with the world, but she could still moralize about all the morning visits, and since she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her beauty and that of her sisters, her father suspected that she had accepted the change without displeasure.</t6223>
<t6224>As for Wickham and Lydia, their sisters' weddings left them just as they were.</t6224> <t6225>He philosophically accepted the conviction that Elizabeth would now know all his falsehoods and all his ingratitude that she had previously ignored; but nevertheless, he still harbored the hope that Darcy would influence his fortune.</t6225> <t6226>The congratulatory letter for her marriage that Elizabeth received from Lydia implied that such hope was cherished, if not by him, at least by his wife.</t6226> <t6227>It read as follows:</t6227>
<t6228>My dear Lizzy,</t6228>
<t6229>I wish you the greatest happiness.</t6229> <t6230>If you love Mr. Darcy half as much as I love my beloved Wickham, you will be very happy.</t6230> <t6231>It is a great comfort to think that you are so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, remember us.</t6231> <t6232>I am sure that Wickham would very much like a court appointment, and we will never have enough money to live there without some help.</t6232> <t6233>I mean a position of about three or four hundred pounds a year; but, in any case, do not mention this to Darcy if you do not think it appropriate.</t6233>
<t6234>And as it happened that Elizabeth found it very inconvenient, in her reply she tried to put an end to all such pleas and dreams.</t6234> <t6235>But she often sent all the help that her practice of what she called economy in her private expenses allowed.</t6235> <t6236>It was always evident that the income managed by people as extravagant as the two of them and so careless about the future, would be insufficient to sustain themselves.</t6236> <t6237>Every time they moved, either Jane or she would receive some plea for help to pay their bills.</t6237> <t6238>Their life, even after peace confined them to a home, was extremely hectic.</t6238> <t6239>They were always moving from one place to another in search of a cheaper house and always spending more than they could afford.</t6239> <t6240>Wickham's affection for Lydia soon turned into indifference; Lydia's lasted a bit longer, and despite her youth and demeanor, she retained all the rights to the reputation that her marriage had given her.</t6240>
<t6241>Although Darcy never received Wickham at Pemberley, he helped him progress in his career out of consideration for Elizabeth.</t6241> <t6242>Lydia paid them a visit now and then when her husband went to have fun in London or went to take baths.</t6242> <t6243>They often spent seasons with the Bingleys, to such an extent that they managed to ruin Bingley's good humor and he hinted that they should leave.</t6243>
<t6244>Miss Bingley was very resentful of Darcy's marriage, but as soon as she felt entitled to visit Pemberley, her resentment passed: she was crazier than ever about Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as before, and so courteous to Elizabeth that she paid her overdue respects.</t6244>
<t6245>Georgiana then stayed to live at Pemberley and grew fond of her sister as much as Darcy had anticipated.</t6245> <t6246>The two loved each other tenderly.</t6246> <t6247>Georgiana had the highest regard for Elizabeth, although at first she was astonished and almost frightened to see how playful she was with her brother; she saw that man who had always inspired in her a respect that almost surpassed affection, become the object of frank jokes.</t6247> <t6248>Her understanding received insights she had never encountered before.</t6248> <t6249>Enlightened by Elizabeth, she began to understand that a woman can take liberties with her husband that a brother can never tolerate from a sister ten years younger than him.</t6249>
<t6250>Lady Catherine became furious about her nephew's wedding, and as she unleashed all her genuine frankness in her reply to the letter in which he informed her of his engagement, she used such immoderate language, especially when referring to Elizabeth, that their relations were interrupted for some time.</t6250> <t6251>But, in the end, convinced by Elizabeth, Darcy agreed to forgive the offense and sought reconciliation.</t6251> <t6252>His aunt still resisted a little, but she yielded either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife behaved, so she deigned to visit them at Pemberley, despite the desecration her woods had suffered not only by the presence of such a mistress but also by the visits of her uncles from London.</t6252>
<t6253>The Darcys were always in the most intimate relationship with the Gardiners.</t6253> <t6254>Darcy, like Elizabeth, truly cared for them; both felt the deepest gratitude towards the people who, by bringing Elizabeth to Derbyshire, had been the cause of their union.</t6254>
