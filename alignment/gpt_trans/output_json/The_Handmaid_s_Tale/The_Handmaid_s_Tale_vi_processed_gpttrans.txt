<t0>I – Night</t0>
<t1>1</t1>
<t2>We slept in what used to be the gymnasium.</t2> <t3>The floor was made of varnished wood, painted with circles and lines for games of the past; the basketball hoops were still there, though the nets were gone.</t3> <t4>A long balcony ran along the four walls, meant for spectators, and I could almost smell, faintly like a lingering echo, the pungent scent of sweat, mixed with hints of chewing gum and perfume from the girls watching, dressed in wool skirts – I saw it in movies – then over time to mini skirts, pants, and finally with one ear pierced, hair streaked with blue and spiked with gel.</t4> <t5>Perhaps dances were also held here: the music still lingers, layers of sound overlapping without listeners, one tune covering another, the drumbeats blending, the mournful wails, garlands made of crepe paper, cardboard devil masks, the glass ball on the ceiling slowly turning, scattering clusters of light over the dancing couples.</t5>
<t6>At that time, the room was filled with the scent of old intimacy and loneliness, and a longing, waiting for something without shape or name.</t6> <t7>I still remember that longing, yearning for something always just ahead and always new, like the hands that had been placed on me there, at that moment, on the small of my back, or further away, in the parking lot, or in the room with the TV turned down low, only flickering images casting shadows on the moving flesh.</t7>
<t8>We long for the future.</t8> <t9>Where does that talent come from, that never-satisfied desire?</t9> <t10>It hovers in the air; and it remains in the air, like a late thought, when we try to lull ourselves to sleep, on the military folding beds arranged in rows, spaced apart to prevent any intention of conversation.</t10> <t11>The beds are made with faux flannel sheets, like children's, and the blankets are also military issue, old blankets still bearing the U.S. mark.</t11> <t12>Clothes are neatly folded and placed on the stool at the foot of the bed.</t12> <t13>The lights are dim but not completely off.</t13> <t14>Aunt Sara and Aunt Elizabeth hover around supervising, cattle prods dangling from their leather belts.</t14>
<t15>But not the guns; even they couldn't put guns in our hands.</t15> <t16>The guns were reserved for the guards, the Angels carefully chosen.</t16> <t17>The guards were not allowed inside the school unless summoned, and we were not allowed out, except for the twice-daily walks, in pairs, around the football field, fenced with wire mesh and barbed wire.</t17> <t18>Outside, the Angels stood with their backs turned.</t18> <t19>They instilled fear, and kindled other feelings within us.</t19> <t20>If only they would turn and look.</t20> <t21>If only we could speak to them.</t21> <t22>We imagined we could exchange something, establish a deal, a barter; we still had our bodies.</t22> <t23>Such were our dreams.</t23>
<t24>We learned to whisper almost inaudibly.</t24> <t25>In the dim light, we could reach out, when the aunts weren't paying attention, and touch each other through the gaps between the beds.</t25> <t26>We learned to read each other's lips, cheek pressed against the bed, lying on our sides, watching each other's mouths move.</t26> <t27>In this way, names were passed along, from bed to bed.</t27>
<t28>Alma.</t28> <t29>Janine.</t29> <t30>Dolores.</t30> <t31>Moira.</t31> <t32>June.</t32>
<t33>II –</t33> <t34>Shopping</t34>
<t35>2</t35>
<t36>One chair, one table, one lamp.</t36> <t37>High up on the whitewashed ceiling, a wreath in relief, with a gaping hole of plaster in the center, like an empty socket where an eye had been removed.</t37> <t38>There must have once hung a chandelier here.</t38> <t39>They had taken away everything that could be used to tie a rope to.</t39>
<t40>A window, two white curtains.</t40> <t41>Below is the windowsill with a small cushion placed on it.</t41> <t42>When the window is slightly open – never more than that – the wind blows in, making the curtains sway.</t42> <t43>I can sit on the chair, or on the windowsill, arms folded, watching this scene.</t43> <t44>Sunlight also comes in through the window, falling onto the floor, made of wood, assembled from narrow planks, polished to a shine.</t44> <t45>I can smell the polish.</t45> <t46>The floor is covered with a rug, oval-shaped, woven from rags.</t46> <t47>They like that style: folk craftsmanship, somewhat old-fashioned, made by women in their spare time, from discarded materials.</t47> <t48>Returning to traditional values.</t48> <t49>Waste not, want not.</t49> <t50>I am not being wasted. Why is there still not enough?</t50>
<t51>On the wall above the chair, a painting, framed but without glass: it depicts flowers, blue irises, watercolor.</t51> <t52>Flowers are still allowed.</t52> <t53>Do we all have the same paintings, the same chairs, the same white curtains?</t53> <t54>Standard issue?</t54>
<t55>Just consider it like being in the military, Aunt Lydia said.</t55>
<t56>There is a bed.</t56> <t57>A single bed, medium-firm mattress, white sheets stuffed with recycled cotton.</t57> <t58>The bed is for nothing other than sleeping – or not sleeping.</t58> <t59>I try not to think too much.</t59> <t60>Like everything right now, even thinking has to be rationed.</t60> <t61>There are many things not worth the effort of thinking about.</t61> <t62>Thinking too much can affect your chances, and I want to survive.</t62> <t63>I know why there is no glass, why the watercolor painting of irises is covered, and why the window is only slightly open, using unbreakable glass.</t63> <t64>It's not that they fear escape.</t64> <t65>We wouldn't get far anyway.</t65> <t66>But they fear that other escape, the one we could open within ourselves, with just something sharp-edged.</t66>
<t67>That's it.</t67> <t68>Besides those points, this is also like a living room at a university, meant for the most ordinary guests; or a boarding room, in the old days, for ladies in reduced circumstances.</t68> <t69>Just like us now.</t69> <t70>All in reduced circumstances, that is, for those who still have circumstances.</t70>
<t71>But chairs, sunlight, and flowers: should not be denied.</t71> <t72>I am still alive, I live, I breathe, I stretch my hand, spread wide, reaching into the sunlight.</t72> <t73>Where I live is not a prison, but a privilege, Aunt Lydia said so, faithful to her either-or formula.</t73>
<t74>The hour bell is ringing.</t74> <t75>Here, the time is announced by bells, like in old monasteries.</t75> <t76>Also like monasteries, there are hardly any mirrors.</t76>
<t77>I stood up from the chair, stepped into the sunlight, in red shoes with flat soles, to protect my spine, not for dancing.</t77> <t78>The red gloves lay on the bed.</t78> <t79>I picked them up, put them on my hands, one finger at a time.</t79> <t80>Everything except the wings on either side of my face was red: the color of blood, our sign.</t80> <t81>A flared dress reaching the ankles, a flat corset up to the chest, long sleeves covering completely.</t81> <t82>Even the white wings were special items: so we couldn't see, but also wouldn't be seen.</t82> <t83>I didn't look good in red clothes, they didn't suit me at all.</t83> <t84>I picked up the shopping basket, slung it over my arm.</t84>
<t85>The door of this room – not my room, I'm not talking about my room – is not locked.</t85> <t86>To be precise, it cannot be closed.</t86> <t87>I step out into the polished hallway, with a long carpet in the middle, pink mixed with gray.</t87> <t88>Like a trail through the forest, like a velvet carpet for dignitaries, it guides my way.</t88>
<t89>The carpet turned the corner and went down the stairs ahead, and I followed, sliding my hand along the banister, which was once a tree, felled in a century long past, worn to a glossy shine.</t89> <t90>Late Victorian, a house for a whole family, a large, wealthy family.</t90> <t91>The hall had a grandfather clock, measuring out time bit by bit, followed by a door leading to the main lounge, with a motherly appearance, tinged with flesh tones.</t91> <t92>A lounge where I had never sat or lain down to rest, only knelt or stood.</t92> <t93>At the other end of the hall, above the main door, a half-moon stained glass window: floral patterns, red and blue.</t93>
<t94>There is still a mirror on the wall in the hall.</t94> <t95>If you turn your head so that the two wings limit the rotation field to look straight into it, you will see it when going down the stairs, round, convex, as long as a person, like a fish's eye, seeing myself in it as a distorted shadow, not knowing what to mock – a fairy tale character wearing a red scarf, gradually descending to a moment of carelessness as equal to danger.</t95> <t96>A Nun, dipped in blood.</t96>
<t97>At the end of the stairs, there was a hat and umbrella stand made of bent wood, with long round rods gently coiled into hooks that looked like young fern leaves unfurling.</t97> <t98>A few umbrellas were left there: a black one, belonging to the Commander, a blue one, belonging to the Commander's Wife, and one meant for me, which was red.</t98> <t99>I left the red umbrella alone, as I saw through the door that it was sunny today.</t99> <t100>I wondered if the Commander's Wife was in the lounge.</t100> <t101>She wasn't always resting.</t101> <t102>Occasionally, I would hear her walking back and forth, one heavy step followed by a light step, and the faint sound of her cane tapping on the peach-pinkish gray carpet.</t102>
<t103>I walked along the hallway, past the door to the lounge and the door leading to the dining room, and opened the door at the end of the hallway to enter the kitchen.</t103> <t104>The smell of wood polish was no longer there.</t104> <t105>Rita was there, standing by the kitchen table, its white enamel surface chipped at the edges.</t105> <t106>She was wearing Martha's usual outfit, a dull green, like an old-fashioned surgical gown.</t106> <t107>It was similar to my dress, long and fully covered, but with an apron and without the white wings or veil.</t107> <t108>She only wore the veil when going outside, but it didn't matter if anyone saw the faces of the Marthas.</t108> <t109>Her sleeves were rolled up to the elbows, revealing her brown arms.</t109> <t110>She was making bread, tossing each loaf for a final knead before putting it into the mold.</t110>
<t111>Seeing me, Rita nodded, it was hard to tell if she was greeting me or just acknowledging my presence, and wiped her flour-covered hands on her apron to rummage through the kitchen drawer for the ration book.</t111> <t112>Her brows furrowed, she tore out three sheets and handed them to me.</t112> <t113>If she smiled, her face would probably look kind.</t113> <t114>But the frown wasn't directed at me personally: she was annoyed by the red dress and its implications.</t114> <t115>She thought I could be contagious, like a disease or a bad omen.</t115>
<t116>Occasionally, I eavesdrop outside the closed door, something I would never have done in the past.</t116> <t117>I don't listen for long because I don't want to get caught.</t117> <t118>However, once I heard Rita telling Cora that she would not allow herself to stoop to such a level.</t118>
<t119>Who asked you? Cora said.</t119> <t120>And besides, what would you do in that case?</t120>
<t121>Arriving at the Expatriate area, Rita said.</t121> <t122>They have the right to choose.</t122>
<t123>With the group of useless women, to starve to death and God knows what else?</t123> <t124>Cora said.</t124> <t125>Please, I beg you.</t125>
<t126>They are shelling beans; through the nearly closed door, I can still hear the hard beans clinking into the metal bowl.</t126> <t127>I hear Rita's voice, grumbling or sighing, in protest or agreement.</t127>
<t128>Anyway, they do it just for us, Cora said, or at least that's what they claim.</t128> <t129>If I hadn't tied it already, who knows, it might have been my turn, that is if I were ten years younger.</t129> <t130>It's not that bad.</t130> <t131>At least there's nothing you could call strenuous.</t131>
<t132>It's better it than me, Rita said, and I pushed the door open.</t132> <t133>On their faces appeared the same look as all women caught gossiping, thinking the subject had overheard: embarrassed, but also somewhat defensive, it was their right after all. That day, Cora was kinder to me, and Rita was more irritable than usual.</t133>
<t134>Today, despite Rita's tightly closed face and pursed lips, I still want to stay here, in this kitchen.</t134> <t135>Cora might come in from some corner of the house, bringing a bottle of lemon oil and a rag, and Rita will make coffee – in the Commanders' houses, there is still real coffee, and we will sit around Rita's kitchen table, which isn't really Rita's, just like my table isn't really mine, and we will talk about aches and pains, illnesses, feet, backs, all the mischievous things the body likes to come up with, like naughty children.</t135> <t136>We will nod our heads in rhythm to the words of the others, showing that yes, we have been through all of that too.</t136> <t137>We will share remedies and compete to tell of our physical miseries; we will complain softly, in a minor key, mournful like pigeons on the eaves.</t137> <t138>I understand you so well, we will say.</t138> <t139>Or sometimes, a peculiar phrase occasionally heard from the elderly: I hear where you're coming from, as if the voice itself were a traveler, coming from a distant place.</t139> <t140>And it will be like that, and today it truly is.</t140>
<t141>Before, I despised such conversations so much.</t141> <t142>Now I long for them.</t142> <t143>At least it's a conversation.</t143> <t144>It's a form of exchange, after all.</t144>
<t145>Or we trade gossip.</t145> <t146>The Marthas know everything, thanks to the stories they share with each other, the unofficial news transmitted from house to house.</t146> <t147>Just like me, they eavesdrop at doors, of course, and see everything even if their eyes are looking elsewhere.</t147> <t148>Sometimes I overhear, catching snippets of their private conversations.</t148> <t149>Miscarriage, really.</t149> <t150>Or, Stabbed her with a knitting needle, right in the belly.</t150> <t151>Jealousy, what else, has consumed her.</t151> <t152>Or, so provocative, Couldn't stand it, Used toilet cleaner, really.</t152> <t153>Worked like a charm, though everyone thought he must have tasted it already.</t153> <t154>Must have been really drunk; but they will track her down soon enough.</t154>
<t155>Or I will help Rita make bread, immersing my hands in the warm, soft, doughy substance that feels very much like flesh.</t155> <t156>I crave touch so intensely, anything that isn't fabric or wood.</t156> <t157>I long to commit the act of touching.</t157>
<t158>But even if I open my mouth to ask, even if I break the rules to that extent, Rita will not agree.</t158> <t159>Her fear is too great.</t159> <t160>The Marthas are not allowed to be friendly with us.</t160>
<t161>Huynh hảo, fraternize, means to behave like brothers with each other.</t161> <t162>It was Luke who told me that.</t162> <t163>He also said there is no corresponding term to describe behaving like sisters with each other.</t163> <t164>Sororize, if it exists, would be it, he said.</t164> <t165>Latin root.</t165> <t166>He likes to explore such meticulous details.</t166> <t167>The process of word derivation, specific usages. I often tease him for that pedantic habit.</t167>
<t168>I took the tickets from Rita's outstretched hand.</t168> <t169>On the tickets were drawings indicating their value: a dozen eggs, a piece of cheese, something brown understood to be roast meat.</t169> <t170>I put them all into the zippered pocket on my sleeve, along with the pass.</t170>
<t171>“Make sure to get the fresh kind, those eggs,” she said.</t171> <t172>“Not like last time.</t172> <t173>And remember, it should be young chicken meat, tell them that, not hen meat.</t173> <t174>Just tell them it's for someone and they won't dare to ignore it.</t174><t175>”</t175>
<t176>"I remember," I said.</t176> <t177>I did not smile.</t177> <t178>Why tempt her with friendship?</t178>
<t179>3</t179>
<t180>I went out through the back door, into the garden, which was spacious and clean: a lawn in the center, a willow tree, and a sorrowful cluster of foxtail plants; around the edges of the garden were flower beds, with yellow daffodils wilting, tulips just beginning to bud, their colors spreading outward.</t180> <t181>The red flowers, darker at the base of the petals, looked like cuts that were starting to heal.</t181>
<t182>This garden is the domain of the Commander’s Wife.</t182> <t183>From my unbroken window, I often see her there, kneeling on a cushion, a bright blue veil draped over her wide-brimmed gardening hat, beside her a large basket containing pruning shears and strings to tie the flowers into place.</t183> <t184>A Guardian assigned specifically to this Commander handles the digging, while the Commander’s Wife directs, holding a long cane to point things out.</t184> <t185>Many Wives have such garden plots, which they arrange, tend, and oversee.</t185>
<t186>I once had a garden.</t186> <t187>I still remember the smell of freshly turned soil, the plump flower bulbs in my cupped hands, the heavy feeling, the seeds rustling as they poured through my fingers.</t187> <t188>Time seemed to pass faster that way.</t188> <t189>Sometimes, the Commander's Lady would have a chair brought out, and she would just sit there, in her garden.</t189> <t190>From a distance, it looked like peace.</t190>
<t191>Now she is not here, and I start to wonder where she might be: I don't fancy suddenly running into her.</t191> <t192>She could be sewing, in the sitting room, with her left leg propped up on a stool, due to chronic rheumatism.</t192> <t193>Or she could be knitting scarves, for the Angels on the front lines.</t193> <t194>I find it hard to believe that the Angels would need those scarves; besides, the scarves made by the Commander's Wife are too elaborate.</t194> <t195>She doesn't care for cross and star patterns like most other Ladies, as she finds them unworthy of her skill.</t195> <t196>Along the two ends of the scarves she knits rows of fig trees, or eagles, or tiny stiff figures, boys and girls, girls and boys.</t196> <t197>Not scarves for adults but for the little ones.</t197>
<t198>Sometimes I think that scarf isn't meant to be sent to the Angel, but will be unraveled and returned to the skeins of yarn, waiting to be re-knit from the beginning.</t198> <t199>Maybe just to give the Ladies something to keep busy with, a purpose for the days and months.</t199> <t200>But I am envious of the knitting of the Commander's Wife.</t200> <t201>Having small, easily achievable goals, how wonderful that would be.</t201>
<t202>What is she jealous of me for?</t202>
<t203>She doesn't talk to me unless absolutely necessary.</t203> <t204>I am a living reproach and an essential need for her.</t204>
<t205>The lady and I faced each other for the first time five weeks ago, when I arrived to take up my post.</t205> <t206>The guard from the old post brought me to the front door.</t206> <t207>In the early days, we were allowed to use the front door, but later had to use the side door.</t207> <t208>Things were still not settled, it was still too early, people were still hesitant about determining our status.</t208> <t209>In a little while, it will be either all back doors, or all front doors.</t209>
<t210>Aunt Lydia mentioned that she is lobbying behind the scenes for the front door.</t210> <t211>You ladies are in a position of honor, she said.</t211>
<t212>The Guardian rang the doorbell for me, but before anyone could hear it and come to the door, it had already opened inward.</t212> <t213>She must have been waiting, I thought a Martha would come out, but it was her, in the unmistakable long blue dress.</t213>
<t214>So you are the new one, she said.</t214> <t215>She didn't step aside to let me in but stood there blocking the door.</t215> <t216>She wanted me to understand clearly that I was not allowed to enter the house unless she permitted it.</t216> <t217>There are such petty power plays these days over trivial matters like this.</t217>
<t218>Yes, I replied.</t218>
<t219>Just leave it on the porch.</t219> <t220>She told the guard, who was carrying my bag.</t220> <t221>A red vinyl bag, not big.</t221> <t222>There was another bag, containing winter clothes and thick items, but it would come later.</t222>
<t223>The Guard put the bag down and bowed to her.</t223> <t224>Then I heard footsteps echoing behind me, back towards the entrance, the front gate clanking shut, and felt as if the covering force had just been ordered to retreat.</t224> <t225>The threshold of a new house is always a lonely place.</t225>
<t226>She waited until the car roared away.</t226> <t227>I did not look at her face, but at the part of her body still visible when her head was bowed: the blue waist, tightly bound; the left hand placed on the ivory cane; the large diamonds on the ring finger, surely once very beautiful and still well-preserved; on the finger with protruding joints, the nail filed into a gently curved shape.</t227> <t228>It looked like a mocking smile, lying on the finger; as if something was mocking her.</t228>
<t229>You may come in, she said.</t229> <t230>She turned her back and limped into the hall.</t230> <t231>Remember to close the door when you come in.</t231>
<t232>I put the red bag inside, clearly it was her intention, then closed the door.</t232> <t233>I didn't say anything to her.</t233> <t234>Aunt Lydia said it's best not to open your mouth unless you're asked directly.</t234> <t235>Try to put yourself in their position, she said, wringing her hands together, a tense pleading smile.</t235> <t236>It's not easy for them.</t236>
<t237>Here, the Lady Commander spoke.</t237> <t238>When I entered the lounge, she was already seated, her left leg resting on a stool, on a small-stitched embroidered cushion with roses in a basket.</t238> <t239>The knitting items were on the floor next to the chair, with the knitting needles pointing upwards.</t239>
<t240>I stood before her, arms crossed.</t240> <t241>So there, she said.</t241> <t242>She was holding a cigarette and placed it on her lips, clamping down as she lit it.</t242> <t243>Her lips were pressed so thin, the outline of her lips forming the fine vertical lines often seen in lipstick advertisements.</t243> <t244>An ivory-colored lighter.</t244> <t245>The cigarette was probably bought on the black market, I thought, and began to hope.</t245> <t246>Even if there was no more cash, at least there was still the black market.</t246> <t247>There is always a black market, always something to trade.</t247> <t248>So she was someone capable of bending the rules.</t248> <t249>But what do I have to trade?</t249>
<t250>I look at the cigarette with unease.</t250> <t251>For me, like alcohol and coffee, this is forbidden.</t251>
<t252>Old to the point that it doesn't work anymore, she said.</t252>
<t253>Yes, madam, I said.</t253>
<t254>She let out a sound that seemed like a laugh, then coughed.</t254> <t255>Unfortunate for you, she said.</t255> <t256>It's the second time for you, isn't it?</t256>
<t257>Tuesday, madam, I said.</t257>
<t258>Unlucky for you too, she said.</t258> <t259>Another burst of laughter accompanied by coughing.</t259> <t260>Have a seat.</t260> <t261>I don't usually do this, but this time is an exception.</t261>
<t262>I sat down for real, perched on the edge of the straight-backed chair.</t262> <t263>I didn't want to stare around the room, didn't want to appear inattentive in front of her; the marble fireplace immediately to the right along with the mirror above and the bunches of flowers thus only flickered in the corner of my eye.</t263> <t264>Later, I would have plenty of time to look around.</t264>
<t265>Now her face was at eye level with mine.</t265> <t266>I felt like I recognized her, or at least there was something very familiar about her.</t266> <t267>I could see part of her hair, peeking out from under the headscarf.</t267> <t268>It was still blonde.</t268> <t269>At that moment, I thought she might have dyed it blonde, thinking hair dye was another item obtained from the black market, but now I know it's naturally blonde.</t269> <t270>Her eyebrows were shaped into two thin arches, giving her face a constant look of surprise, indignation, or inquiry, like a startled child, but the lashes below looked weary.</t270> <t271>Her eyes, however, were not like that, a hostile, unyielding blue like the summer sky under harsh sunlight, a color that blocked any deeper penetration.</t271> <t272>Her nose must have once been delicate, but now it seemed too small for her face.</t272> <t273>Her face wasn't fat, but it was broad.</t273> <t274>Two lines drooped from the corners of her mouth, meeting at a chin clenched like a fist.</t274>
<t275>I want to see you as little as possible, she said.</t275> <t276>I hope you feel the same way about me.</t276>
<t277>I did not answer, because saying yes would be an insult, while saying no would be against their wishes</t277><t278>.</t278>
<t279>I know you are not stupid, she continued.</t279> <t280>She inhaled and exhaled smoke.</t280> <t281>I have read the file.</t281> <t282>To me, this is entirely a transaction.</t282> <t283>But if there is trouble, I will return everything.</t283> <t284>Do you understand?</t284>
<t285>Yes, madam, I said.</t285>
<t286>"Don't call me madam," she snapped.</t286> <t287>"You are not Martha."</t287>
<t288>I didn't ask what to call her, because it was clear that she hoped I wouldn't have the chance to address her again.</t288> <t289>I was troubled.</t289> <t290>At that time, I wanted her to become a sister, a mother figure, someone who would understand and protect me.</t290> <t291>The lady at the previous post almost always stayed in her room; the Marthas said she was an alcoholic.</t291> <t292>I wanted this time to be different.</t292> <t293>I wanted to imagine that I could love her, assuming it was in another time and space, another life.</t293> <t294>But I had foreseen that I wouldn't love her, just as she wouldn't love me.</t294>
<t295>She stubbed out the cigarette, which was only half-smoked, in an intricately carved ashtray on the table beside the lamp.</t295> <t296>The gesture was very decisive, pressing down firmly, not the dainty tapping like most ladies.</t296>
<t297>As for my husband, she said, he is just that. My husband.</t297> <t298>I want this to be absolutely clear.</t298> <t299>Only death separates us.</t299> <t300>Period.</t300>
<t301>Yes, madam, I repeat, forget about what happened earlier.</t301> <t302>In the past, there was something called a doll, for little girls, that would speak when you pulled the string on its back; I think my voice is like that, a mechanical voice, a doll's voice.</t302> <t303>You must really want to slap me.</t303> <t304>They can hit us, there is precedent written in the holy books.</t304> <t305>But they can't use anything.</t305> <t306>Only their hands.</t306>
<t307>That is one of the achievements of our struggle, the Lady Commander said, and suddenly she no longer looked at me, but looked down at her knotted, diamond-encrusted hand, and I knew where I had seen her before.</t307>
<t308>The first time was on TV, when I was about eight or nine years old.</t308> <t309>That was the time when my mother usually slept in, every Sunday morning, while I would wake up early and run to the TV in her study, switching from channel to channel looking for cartoons.</t309> <t310>Sometimes there were none, so I watched the Gospel program "Growing Souls," which had Bible stories for children and hymns.</t310> <t311>Among the women on that show, there was one named Serena Joy. She led the soprano section.</t311> <t312>Ash blonde hair, petite, upturned nose, big blue eyes that looked up to the sky whenever she sang.</t312> <t313>She could cry and laugh at the same time, with one or two delicate tears rolling down her cheeks, seemingly on cue, while her voice soared to the highest notes, trembling, as if effortlessly.</t313> <t314>It was only later that she switched to pursuing something else.</t314>
<t315>The person sitting in front of me is Serena Joy. At least, she used to be.</t315> <t316>So things are worse than I thought.</t316>
<t317>4</t317>
<t318>I walked along the gravel path that split the backyard lawn neatly, like a part in hair.</t318> <t319>It rained last night; the grass on both sides was soggy, and the air was damp.</t319> <t320>Here and there, earthworms had surfaced, evidence of very fertile soil, caught by the sun, half-dead; limp and pinkish, like lips.</t320>
<t321>I pushed the white picket gate and continued, across the front lawn straight to the door.</t321> <t322>On the driveway, one of the Guardians assigned to the household was washing a car.</t322> <t323>That means the Commander is home, in his office, behind the dining room, where he seems to sit all day.</t323>
<t324>The car is extremely expensive, a whirlwind; much better than a horse-drawn carriage, far surpassing the sturdy, squat buffalo.</t324> <t325>The car is black, of course, a color that signifies privilege or mourning, long and shiny.</t325> <t326>The driver gently glides a piece of leather across the entire body of the car, lovingly.</t326> <t327>At least that hasn't changed, the way men meticulously care for fine cars.</t327>
<t328>The talented man wore the same Guard uniform, but his hat was tilted mischievously to one side and his sleeves were rolled up to the elbows, revealing his tanned arm with a light dusting of black hair.</t328> <t329>A cigarette was tucked in the corner of his mouth, indicating that he too had some dealings in the black market.</t329>
<t330>I know your name: Nick.</t330> <t331>I know because I heard Rita and Cora mention you, and once I heard the Commander say to you: Nick, I won't be using the car today.</t331>
<t332>He lives right here, in the house, by the garage.</t332> <t333>Low status: he hasn't been assigned a woman, not even one.</t333> <t334>He's not ranked: some deficiency, lacking connections.</t334> <t335>But he acts like he doesn't know, or doesn't care.</t335> <t336>He behaves so casually, he doesn't show enough obedience.</t336> <t337>Maybe he's stupid, but I don't think so.</t337> <t338>Different face, different heart, as they say, I smell a rat.</t338> <t339>Outcasts signal through scent.</t339> <t340>Unintentionally, I suddenly think he might have a smell.</t340> <t341>Not the smell of rot or a decaying rat; tanned skin, damp from the sun, faint in the smoke.</t341> <t342>I sigh, take a deep breath.</t342>
<t343>He looked at me, seeing that I was looking at him.</t343> <t344>He had a French-style face, thin, quirky, all angles and edges, with wrinkled lips when he smiled.</t344> <t345>He took one last drag of his cigarette, dropped it to the ground, and stomped on it.</t345> <t346>He started to whistle.</t346> <t347>Then he winked.</t347>
<t348>I bowed my head and turned so that the white wings covered my face, continuing to walk.</t348> <t349>He just took a risk, but for what?</t349> <t350>What if I report it?</t350>
<t351>Maybe he was just being friendly.</t351> <t352>Maybe he saw my expression and misunderstood the reason.</t352> <t353>In fact, I just craved a cigarette.</t353>
<t354>It could be a test, to see how I respond.</t354>
<t355>He might be an Eye.</t355>
<t356>~</t356>
<t357>I pushed the gate and then closed it behind me, looking down without turning back.</t357> <t358>The red brick sidewalk.</t358> <t359>That was the scene I focused on, a field of diamond-shaped tiles, slightly sagging where the ground underneath had sunken after many decades of winter frost.</t359> <t360>The bricks had faded in color, but looked fresh and clean.</t360> <t361>The sidewalk was swept more thoroughly than before.</t361>
<t362>I went to the corner of the street to wait.</t362> <t363>Before, I wasn't good at waiting.</t363> <t364>Even those who just stand and wait, they also serve Him, Aunt Lydia said so.</t364> <t365>She made us memorize it.</t365> <t366>She also said, Not all of you will be able to do it.</t366> <t367>Some of you will fall on barren ground or among thorns.</t367> <t368>Some of you will only take shallow roots.</t368> <t369>On her chin, there was a mole that moved up and down as she spoke.</t369> <t370>She said, Consider yourselves as seeds, and then her voice was conspiratorial, like those of ballet teachers for children in the old days, when they said, Raise your arms, pretend to be a tree.</t370>
<t371>I stand at the corner of the street, pretending to be a tree.</t371>
<t372>~</t372>
<t373>A figure, dressed in red, face hidden behind white wings, a figure resembling me, a woman without expression wearing a red dress and carrying a basket, walking along the brick sidewalk towards me.</t373> <t374>She came to my spot and we both stared intently at each other's faces, glancing towards the end of the tunnel wrapped in white fabric.</t374> <t375>It was indeed her.</t375>
<t376>“Blessed be the fruit,” she said to me, the prescribed greeting among those like me.</t376>
<t377>“Pray for the Lord to grant us offspring,” I replied, the prescribed answer.</t377> <t378>We turned and walked side by side through the large building complex, towards the city center.</t378> <t379>We were only allowed to go there in pairs.</t379> <t380>They said it was to protect us, though this explanation was absurd: we were already very well protected.</t380> <t381>In reality, she was meant to spy on me, and I on her.</t381> <t382>If one of us slipped up because of something that happened during the outing, there would still be the other to hold accountable.</t382>
<t383>This person has been with me for the past two weeks.</t383> <t384>I don't know what happened to her before.</t384> <t385>One day she didn't come anymore, this person took her place, that's all there is to it.</t385> <t386>These kinds of things shouldn't be questioned, because you usually don't get the answer you want to hear.</t386> <t387>In general, you don't get any answer at all.</t387>
<t388>She is a little fatter than me.</t388> <t389>Brown eyes.</t389> <t390>Her name is Ofglen, that's all I know about her.</t390> <t391>She walks with a proper posture, head bowed, red-gloved hands clasped tightly together in front of her chest, taking short steps like a pet pig on its hind legs.</t391> <t392>During our walks, she has never said anything beyond the strict orthodox boundaries, but in fact, neither have I.</t392> <t393>She could be a true believer, a Handmaid not just in name.</t393> <t394>I must not take risks.</t394>
<t395>“The war is picking up, or so they say,” she said.</t395>
<t396>“Glory,” I replied.</t396>
<t397>“We have been blessed with beautiful weather.”</t397>
<t398>“I am immensely grateful.”</t398>
<t399>“Have defeated more rebels since yesterday.”</t399>
<t400>“Glory be,” I said.</t400> <t401>I didn’t ask how she knew.</t401> <t402>“Which ones?”</t402>
<t403>"The Purification Sect.</t403> <t404>They have a base in the Green Hills. We smoke them out and force them to flee."</t404>
<t405>“Glory be.”</t405>
<t406>Sometimes I wish she would shut up so I could have some peace and leave.</t406> <t407>But I crave news, any news; even if it's fake news, it must have some meaning.</t407>
<t408>We reached the first barrier, similar to those at road construction sites or water pipe installations: a wooden beam painted yellow and black in stripes, and a red octagonal "Stop" sign.</t408> <t409>Near the alleyway, there were several lanterns, unlit because it was not yet dark.</t409> <t410>Up high, I knew, there were spotlights attached to telephone poles for emergencies, and there were people holding machine guns in guard posts on either side of the road.</t410> <t411>I couldn't see the spotlights and guard posts because they were obscured.</t411> <t412>I only knew they were there.</t412>
<t413>Behind the barrier, near the narrow passage, waiting for us, there were two people, wearing the blue uniforms of the Guardians of the Faith, with shoulder straps and hats bearing insignia: two crossed swords, below which was a white triangle.</t413> <t414>The Guardians are not combat soldiers.</t414> <t415>They perform patrol duties and other miscellaneous tasks, such as gardening for the Commander's Wife, and if they are not dull-witted, they are either old, crippled, or too young, except for those who are hidden Eyes.</t415>
<t416>These two people are like fledglings: one with a sparse beard, the other with a still rough face.</t416> <t417>Their youthful appearance easily evokes sympathy, but I know I must not be deceived.</t417> <t418>Youths are often the most dangerous, the most fanatical, the most prone to fiddling with guns.</t418> <t419>They have not yet learned what it means to survive over time.</t419> <t420>One must be cautious with them.</t420>
<t421>Last week, they shot a woman, right near here.</t421> <t422>A Martha.</t422> <t423>She fumbled in her robe, looking for her pass, and they thought she was reaching for a bomb.</t423> <t424>They thought she was a man in disguise.</t424> <t425>There had been such cases before.</t425>
<t426>Rita and Cora know her.</t426> <t427>I heard them talking about it, in the kitchen.</t427>
<t428>We just have to do what needs to be done, Cora said.</t428> <t429>Protect the safety of our own.</t429>
<t430>Only death is the safest, Rita hissed.</t430> <t431>She only minds her own business.</t431> <t432>No need to shoot.</t432> <t433>It was an accident, Cora said.</t433>
<t434>Forget that sentence, Rita said.</t434> <t435>Everything is calculated.</t435>
<t436>I heard her banging pots and pans clanging, in the sink.</t436>
<t437>Well, anyway, people have to think carefully before blowing up this house, Cora said.</t437>
<t438>It's all the same, Rita said.</t438> <t439>She was very diligent.</t439> <t440>It's terrible to die like that.</t440>
<t441>There are many things much worse, Cora said.</t441> <t442>At least it's quick and clean.</t442>
<t443>"That's just your opinion," Rita said.</t443> <t444>"I would rather have more time, maybe a little earlier."</t444> <t445>"Everything is already arranged."</t445>
<t446>~</t446>
<t447>Two young Guards greeted us, touching the brim of their hats with three fingers.</t447> <t448>We were given this ceremony.</t448> <t449>They must show respect for our mission.</t449>
<t450>We presented our travel documents, taken from the zippered pocket in the wide sleeve, the documents were checked and stamped.</t450> <t451>A person entered the right guard post, inputting our code into the computer check machine.</t451>
<t452>When returning the paper, the peach-fuzz-mustached boy tilted his head, trying to look at my face.</t452> <t453>I lifted my head slightly to help, and he looked into my eyes just as I looked into his, and his cheeks turned red.</t453> <t454>His face was long and melancholic, like a sheep, but his eyes were big and round like a dog’s, resembling a floppy-eared spaniel rather than a terrier.</t454> <t455>His skin was pale and fragile-looking, almost sickly, like the new skin of a healing scar.</t455> <t456>Yet I still imagined placing my hand on it, on that bare face.</t456> <t457>He turned away first.</t457>
<t458>That event, that tiny violation, too small for anyone to notice, but moments like that are the rewards I keep for myself, like candies once hidden, when I was little, at the bottom of the drawer.</t458> <t459>They are opportunities, tiny keyholes peeking out.</t459>
<t460>If I come at night, when you are on duty alone – though you will never enjoy that solitude – and allow you inside the white wings?</t460> <t461>If I shed this red shroud and expose myself to you, to them, in the flickering lantern light?</t461> <t462>Surely, at times, they must think about this, during their eternal watch behind the bars, where no one ever passes except for the Commanders of the Faithful in their long black cars, the blue-clad Wives and their veiled white daughters diligently on their way to Redemption or Prayer, or the short green Marthas, or the occasional Birthmobiles, or the red Handmaids, all walking.</t462> <t463>Or sometimes a black-painted van, with the white-winged Eye painted on its side.</t463> <t464>The windows of the vehicle are frosted, and the people in the front seats wear dark glasses: doubly obscured.</t464>
<t465>The truck was certainly quieter than the other vehicles.</t465> <t466>When they passed by, we looked away.</t466> <t467>If there was any noise from the truck, we pretended not to hear it.</t467> <t468>Whose heart is ever perfect?</t468>
<t469>When a black van arrived at the checkpoint, people waved it through.</t469> <t470>The Guards did not want to risk looking inside, searching, or doubting its authority.</t470> <t471>It didn't matter what they thought.</t471>
<t472>If they are thinking; you can't tell by looking at them.</t472>
<t473>But they are likely not thinking about clothes left on the grass.</t473> <t474>If they think about the kiss, they must immediately think about the headlights shining, about the rifle shot.</t474> <t475>They shift their thoughts to duty and the prospect of ascending to an Angel, and who knows, maybe being allowed to marry, and then, if they gain enough power and live long enough, being granted a Handmaid of their own.</t475>
<t476>~</t476>
<t477>He opened the small pedestrian gate and stepped back, staying far away from it, and we passed through.</t477> <t478>Their footsteps faded away but I knew they were watching, two young men, not yet allowed to touch women.</t478> <t479>In return, they caressed with their eyes and I swayed my hips a little, feeling the red puffed skirt swirl around my body.</t479> <t480>It was no different from sticking out your tongue behind a barrier or teasing a dog with a bone just out of reach, and I felt ashamed for doing it, because these things weren't the fault of these two, they were still too young.</t480>
<t481>Then I realized I wasn't embarrassed at all.</t481> <t482>I savored the feeling of power; the power of a bone, passive, but right in front of their noses.</t482> <t483>I prayed that just by looking at us, they would get aroused and have to rub against the black and yellow painted barrier, secretly.</t483> <t484>They would have to suffer later, at night, in their individually assigned beds.</t484> <t485>Now they had no outlet other than themselves, which was blasphemous. No more magazines, no more films, no alternative routes; just me and the shadow, gradually moving away from the two boys standing stiffly at the checkpoint, watching the two figures recede.</t485>
<t486>5</t486>
<t487>Carrying the version, I walked on the street.</t487> <t488>Even though I had left the Commanders' residential area, there were still large houses here.</t488> <t489>In front of one house, a Guard was pushing a lawn mower.</t489> <t490>The lawn was neat, the facade was splendid, regularly maintained; it looked like the magnificent pictures printed in old home-garden-interior magazines.</t490> <t491>Also with the same absence of people, the same drowsy appearance.</t491> <t492>The streets were almost like a museum, or like a model city built to display how people used to live.</t492> <t493>Just like those pictures, those museums, those cities, children were not present.</t493>
<t494>This is the heart of Gilead, where civil war cannot penetrate, except through television.</t494> <t495>The border is unclear, it often shifts, depending on the attacks and counterattacks; but the center is here, it never moves.</t495> <t496>The Republic of Gilead, Aunt Lydia says, has no borders.</t496> <t497>Gilead is within us.</t497>
<t498>Doctors used to live here, as well as lawyers and university lecturers.</t498> <t499>Now there are no more lawyers, and the university has also closed down.</t499>
<t500>Luke and I often walked side by side, sometimes, on these streets.</t500> <t501>We often talked about buying a house like the ones here, a really big old house, and renovating it.</t501> <t502>There would be a garden, with swings for the children.</t502> <t503>We would have children.</t503> <t504>Even though we knew the chances of realizing those luxuries were quite low, we still liked to talk about it, a Sunday pastime.</t504> <t505>That freedom now feels unreal.</t505>
<t506>At the corner, we turned onto the main road, where the traffic was denser.</t506> <t507>Cars sped by, mostly black, some gray and brown.</t507> <t508>More women carrying baskets, some red, some Martha's dull green, some wearing striped clothes, red and blue and green and cheap and neatly woven, the style of poor women's clothing.</t508> <t509>Frugal wives, that's what they're called.</t509> <t510>These women are not assigned different duties.</t510> <t511>They have to do everything, if possible.</t511> <t512>Occasionally, someone dressed entirely in black, a widow.</t512> <t513>There used to be more, but they seem to be gradually disappearing.</t513> <t514>No Commander's Wives were seen on the sidewalks.</t514> <t515>They always sit in the car.</t515>
<t516>The sidewalk here is made of cement.</t516> <t517>Like a child, I avoid stepping on the cracks.</t517> <t518>I am reminiscing about my feet on the same sidewalk, long ago, remembering the shoes I used to wear.</t518> <t519>Sometimes they were running shoes, with cushioned soles and ventilation holes, adorned with reflective threads that glowed at night.</t519> <t520>Even though I came, I never ran; even during the day, only on familiar paths.</t520>
<t521>In those times, women were not protected.</t521>
<t522>I still remember the rule, unwritten but known by all women: Do not open the door for strangers, even if they claim to be the police.</t522> <t523>Make them slide their ID under the door.</t523> <t524>Do not stop in the middle of the road to help a motorcyclist pretending to be in trouble.</t524> <t525>Keep your pace and continue walking.</t525> <t526>If someone whistles to call you, do not turn around.</t526> <t527>Do not go to the laundromat alone at night.</t527>
<t528>I think again about the laundromats.</t528> <t529>The things I wear to go there: shorts, jeans, workout pants.</t529> <t530>The things I put in there: my clothes, my soap, my money, the money I earned with my own effort.</t530> <t531>I think about the ownership I once had.</t531>
<t532>Now we walk on the same street, in pairs, and no men shout obscene words behind us, talk to us, touch us.</t532> <t533>No one whistles.</t533>
<t534>There is not just one kind of freedom, Aunt Lydia said.</t534> <t535>There is freedom to act and freedom through liberation.</t535> <t536>In the time of anarchy, there was freedom to act.</t536> <t537>Now you are granted freedom through liberation.</t537> <t538>Do not underestimate it.</t538>
<t539>Right in front, on the right side of the road, is the shop where we place our clothes.</t539> <t540>Some people call them uniforms, how accurate that is.</t540> <t541>What becomes a habit is hard to break.</t541> <t542>Outside hangs a very large wooden sign, shaped like a yellow lily; Lily of the field, that's the name of the shop.</t542> <t543>You can see a blank space, right below the lily, there used to be something but now it's been erased with red paint, following the opinion that even the names of the shops have too much allure for us.</t543> <t544>Now shops are only distinguished by their signs.</t544>
<t545>The lily used to be a movie theater, back in the day.</t545> <t546>Students flocked there; every spring there was a festival commemorating Humphrey Bogart, featuring Lauren Bacall or Katharine Hepburn, women who were self-reliant and made their own decisions.</t546> <t547>They wore blouses buttoned down the front, suggesting the idea of unbuttoning.</t547> <t548>Those women could be unbuttoned, or not.</t548> <t549>It seemed they had the right to choose.</t549> <t550>We also seemed to have the right to choose, back then.</t550> <t551>We lived in a society that was suffocating, Aunt Lydia said, under too many choices.</t551>
<t552>I don't know when they will stop organizing parties.</t552> <t553>By that time, I will probably have grown up.</t553> <t554>So I won't be making excuses anymore</t554><t555>.</t555>
<t556>We did not enter Hoa Hue, but crossed the street and turned into a side road.</t556> <t557>The first destination was a store with a wooden sign: three eggs, a bee, a cow.</t557> <t558>Milk and honey.</t558> <t559>There was a long line in front of the door, and we waited our turn, two by two.</t559> <t560>I saw that today there were oranges.</t560> <t561>Since Central America fell to the Liberal faction, oranges have become hard to find, sometimes available, sometimes not.</t561> <t562>The war has disrupted the supply of oranges from California, and even Florida can no longer be relied upon, with blockades or rail lines being bombed.</t562> <t563>I looked at the oranges, longing for one.</t563> <t564>But I did not bring any orange coupons.</t564> <t565>I'll tell Rita about the oranges when I get back, I thought to myself.</t565> <t566>She will be pleased.</t566> <t567>It will be something noteworthy, a small achievement, if I manage to make oranges appear.</t567>
<t568>Those who had made it to the place handed their tickets over the counter to two men in Guardian uniforms standing on the other side.</t568> <t569>No one talked much, though there was still a murmur, and the women discreetly turned their heads to look this way and that: here, while shopping, one might meet someone familiar, someone known from the past, or an acquaintance from the Red Center. Just seeing a familiar face was a great encouragement.</t569> <t570>If only I could see Moira, just see her, know that she still existed.</t570> <t571>It's really hard to imagine that now - having a friend?</t571>
<t572>But Ofglen, beside me, does not look around.</t572> <t573>Maybe she doesn't know anyone anymore.</t573> <t574>Maybe they have all disappeared, all the women she used to know.</t574> <t575>Or maybe she doesn't want to be seen by anyone.</t575> <t576>She stands silently, head bowed down.</t576>
<t577>While standing in a double line like that, the door opened to let in two more people, both dressed in red and white Tùy female attire.</t577> <t578>One of the two was heavily pregnant; her belly, under the loose-fitting clothes, proudly protruded.</t578> <t579>The whole room stirred slightly, there were murmurs, and sighs; even though we didn't want to, we all turned around, conspicuously, to get a clearer look; our itchy fingers just waiting to reach out and touch.</t579> <t580>She was truly a marvel, an object of envy and desire, we looked at her longingly.</t580> <t581>She was the flag planted on the hilltop, showing everyone the way out: even we could be saved.</t581>
<t582>All the women in the room were whispering, almost loudly, how excited they were.</t582>
<t583>"Who is that?" I heard a voice behind me.</t583>
<t584>"Ofwayne.</t584> <t585>But no.</t585> <t586>Ofwarren."</t586>
<t587>“Show-off,” a hiss sounded, and indeed it was.</t587> <t588>A pregnant woman this month shouldn't go out, shouldn't go shopping anymore.</t588> <t589>Nor is she required to take daily walks, which were meant to keep her abdominal muscles functioning normally.</t589> <t590>She only needs free exercises, breathing exercises. She can stay at home.</t590> <t591>Not to mention going out is very dangerous, there must be guards waiting for her out there.</t591> <t592>Now carrying a life within her, she is closer to death, and needs a special security regime.</t592> <t593>She could be a victim of jealousy, this has happened before.</t593> <t594>Every child now is born out of desire, but not everyone's desire.</t594>
<t595>But today's trip might be an unusual whim, and people are easily forgiving of such whims when they have maintained this level without falling.</t595> <t596>Or maybe she belongs to that type.</t596> <t597>Pour some more, I can handle it, a martyr.</t597> <t598>I caught a glimpse of her face when she looked up and around.</t598> <t599>The person standing behind me was right.</t599> <t600>She came here to show off.</t600> <t601>She was radiant, rosy, savoring every little detail.</t601>
<t602>"Order," a Guard behind the counter said, and we shushed each other like a bunch of schoolchildren.</t602>
<t603>Ofglen and I arrived at the counter.</t603> <t604>We handed over the vouchers, and a Guardian entered the numbers into the computer while the other handed over the goods: milk, eggs.</t604> <t605>We put everything into the basket and went out again, past the pregnant woman and her companion, standing there tall and gaunt, like everyone else.</t605> <t606>The pregnant belly looked like a giant fruit.</t606> <t607>Huge, a phrase from my childhood.</t607> <t608>Her hand rested on her belly as if to protect it, yet also as if to receive from it, warmth and strength.</t608>
<t609>When I walked past her, she looked straight at me, right into my eyes, and I recognized her.</t609> <t610>She was also at the Red Center with me, one of Aunt Lydia's pets.</t610> <t611>I never liked her.</t611> <t612>Her name, back then, was Janine.</t612>
<t613>Janine looked at me, like that, and a sneer flickered at the corner of her mouth.</t613> <t614>She slid her eyes down to my flat stomach under the red dress, then the wings obscured her face.</t614> <t615>I could only see the top of her forehead, and the tip of her pink nose.</t615>
<t616>Next, we entered the Meat Market, signaled by a large wooden slab of ribs hanging down from two chains.</t616> <t617>The line here wasn't too long: meat is always expensive, and even the commanders can't afford to eat it every day.</t617> <t618>But Ofglen still got some roast meat, and this is the second time this week.</t618> <t619>I'll tell the Marthas: they always like to hear such things.</t619> <t620>They are very eager to find out how other households live; these small bits of gossip give them a chance to feel either proud or offended.</t620><t621>.</t621>
<t622>I received the chicken, wrapped in parchment paper and tied with string.</t622> <t623>Plastic items are rarely seen, not seen anymore.</t623> <t624>I remember the large bottomless white plastic bags used to carry groceries from the supermarket; I never wanted to throw them away, always stuffing them under the sink, until one day when I opened the cabinet door and they spilled out, scattered all over the floor.</t624> <t625>Luke always complained about that.</t625> <t626>He regularly gathered all the bags and threw them away.</t626>
<t627>He could put one on his head, that's what you'll say.</t627> <t628>You know how kids like to play.</t628> <t629>No, I say.</t629> <t630>He's grown up. (Or smart, or very lucky.) But I'll get chills down my spine, and blame myself for being careless.</t630> <t631>Indeed, I put too much faith in the constants; I even believed in fate, back in the day.</t631> <t632>Then I say, you'll put it on the top shelf.</t632> <t633>Then you say, don't put it away anymore.</t633> <t634>We never use it anyway.</t634> <t635>Then I say, here's the trash bag. Then you say...</t635>
<t636>Not now, not here.</t636> <t637>Not in the middle of everyone watching.</t637> <t638>I turned around, seeing my reflection in the window glass.</t638> <t639>We had made it outside, that's right, we had made it to the street.</t639>
<t640>A group of people is heading towards us.</t640> <t641>A group of foreign tourists, seemingly from Japan, perhaps a trade delegation, touring historical sites or just out to breathe in the local atmosphere.</t641> <t642>They are petite and well-groomed, each holding their own camera, each wearing their own smile.</t642> <t643>They look around, eyes bright, heads tilted to the side like a flock of robins; that sheer exuberance was provocative, and I couldn't help but stare.</t643> <t644>It's been a long time since I've seen women wearing skirts that short.</t644> <t645>The skirts just barely reach past the knees, legs exposed below, stockings so thin they might as well be bare, shameless, wearing high-heeled shoes that cling to their feet like sophisticated torture devices.</t645> <t646>The women totter on their sharp-pointed feet as if on stilts, but without balance; their backs arch at the waist, causing their hips to jut out behind.</t646> <t647>Their heads are uncovered and their hair is exposed, jet black and full of sensuality.</t647> <t648>They wear lipstick, bright red, outlining the moist cavity of their mouths, like scribbles on the walls of public restrooms, from the old days.</t648>
<t649>I stopped walking.</t649> <t650>Beside me, Ofglen also stopped, and I knew she couldn't take her eyes off those women either.</t650> <t651>We were mesmerized, but also disgusted.</t651> <t652>They seemed almost naked.</t652> <t653>It didn't take long for our minds to change about such things.</t653>
<t654>Then I thought: I used to dress like that too.</t654> <t655>That's called freedom.</t655>
<t656>That's Westernization, they used to call it that.</t656>
<t657>The group of Japanese tourists walked towards us, chatting animatedly, and we turned away but it was too late: our faces had already been seen.</t657>
<t658>There was an interpreter among them, wearing the regulation blue suit with a red background tie, and a brooch shaped like a winged eye.</t658> <t659>He was the one who stepped forward, leaving the group, coming in front of us, blocking the way.</t659> <t660>The tourists crowded behind, one person raised a camera.</t660>
<t661>"Excuse me," he said to both of us, quite politely.</t661> <t662>"They want to ask if they can take a picture of you two."</t662>
<t663>I cast my eyes down to the roadside, shaking my head to indicate refusal.</t663> <t664>They only needed to see the white wings, a glimpse of my face, my chin, and a corner of my mouth. Avoid eye contact.</t664> <t665>I knew better than to look directly at the interpreter's face.</t665> <t666>Most interpreters are the Eyes, or at least that's the rumor.</t666>
<t667>I also know that it's wise not to say yes.</t667> <t668>Humility must be invisible, Aunt Lydia said so.</t668> <t669>Never forget.</t669> <t670>To be seen - to be seen - also means - her voice trembling - to be penetrated.</t670> <t671>Your duty is not to be penetrated, girls.</t671> <t672>She called us girls.</t672>
<t673>Beside me, Ofglen is also silent.</t673> <t674>She has tucked her red-gloved hands into her sleeves to hide them.</t674>
<t675>The interpreter returned to the group of guests, chatting with them rapidly, separating each syllable.</t675> <t676>I knew what he was going to say, I had memorized the dialogue.</t676> <t677>He would tell them that the women here have different customs, that being looked at through a camera lens, for them, is a form of violation.</t677>
<t678>I was still looking down, gazing at the roadside, mesmerized by the women's feet.</t678> <t679>There was a woman wearing open-toed sandals, her ten toenails painted pink.</t679> <t680>I still remember the smell of nail polish, remember how it would wrinkle if applied too hastily, remember the thin stockings brushing against the skin, glistening, remember the feeling on the toes when slipping into open-toed sandals under the weight of the whole body.</t680> <t681>The woman with painted toenails balanced her weight.</t681> <t682>I could feel her sandals, right under my feet.</t682> <t683>The smell of nail polish made me hungry.</t683>
<t684>“Excuse me,” the interpreter said again, to get our attention.</t684> <t685>I nodded, indicating that I heard.</t685>
<t686>“He asked if you ladies are happy,” the interpreter said.</t686> <t687>I can imagine their curiosity: Are these ladies happy?</t687> <t688>How can they still be happy? I could feel their bright black eyes scrutinizing me, see them leaning slightly forward to catch the answer, the women the most eager, but the men too: we are mysterious, forbidden, we are alluring.</t688>
<t689>Ofglen said nothing.</t689> <t690>There was a long silence.</t690> <t691>But sometimes saying nothing is just as dangerous.</t691>
<t692>“Yes, we are very happy,” I said softly.</t692> <t693>I had to say something.</t693> <t694>What else could I say?</t694>
<t695>6</t695>
<t696>Passing by a block of houses, Ofglen pauses, as if hesitating which way to go.</t696> <t697>We have two choices.</t697> <t698>We can go straight back, or take the longer route.</t698> <t699>We already know which way we'll go, because we always take that route.</t699>
<t700>“I want to go by the church,” Ofglen said, looking very devout.</t700>
<t701>“Alright,” I said, even though we both knew exactly what the real reason was.</t701>
<t702>We walked in silence.</t702> <t703>The sun had set, and in the sky, the white clouds looked like a flock of headless sheep.</t703> <t704>With wings like the blinders on a horse, it was very difficult for us to look up, to see the whole picture, the sky, and everything around us.</t704> <t705>But we still managed, piece by piece: quickly tilting our heads, up or down, to the sides.</t705> <t706>We had trained ourselves to view the world through many fleeting glimpses.</t706>
<t707>On the right, if allowed to go, there is a street leading to the river.</t707> <t708>There is a boathouse, a dock for double-oared racing boats, and in the past, there were even some cranes; trees, green grassy banks, where one could sit and watch the water flow, watch young men with bare arms, oars swinging in the sunlight as they competed for victory.</t708>
<t709>The road to the river will pass by the old dormitory buildings, now used for other purposes, with round towers that look like something out of a fairy tale, painted white, yellow, and blue.</t709> <t710>When thinking about the past, we only choose to remember the beautiful things.</t710> <t711>We want to believe that everything was like that in the old days.</t711>
<t712>The football field is also on that road, where the Men's Redemption sessions are held.</t712> <t713>And also the football matches.</t713> <t714>There is still football.</t714>
<t715>I no longer go to the river, nor do I cross the bridge.</t715> <t716>I don't take the subway, even though there is one right over there.</t716> <t717>We are not allowed to board, now the train has guards, and there is no official reason for us to go down those steps, take the train under the river, and go into the city center.</t717> <t718>What would we want to go from here to there for? It must be for a bad purpose, and they would know immediately.</t718>
<t719>The church is quite small, one of the first to be built, many hundreds of years ago.</t719> <t720>It no longer holds services, only serves as a museum, with many paintings inside, depicting women in somber long dresses, their hair wrapped in white scarves, and men standing upright, dressed in dark colors, with unsmiling mouths.</t720> <t721>Those are our ancestors.</t721> <t722>Free admission.</t722>
<t723>But we did not go in, instead, we stood on the pathway, looking at the churchyard.</t723> <t724>The old tombstones were still there, dilapidated, eroded, skull and crossbones, memento mori, powdered-faced angels, winged hourglasses reminding us of the fleeting earthly time, and, in the later centuries, urns and weeping willows, serving as places to send grief and mourning.</t724>
<t725>They still haven't done anything to the tombstones, and the church as well.</t725> <t726>Only the recent era has offended them.</t726>
<t727>Ofglen bows her head, as if in prayer.</t727> <t728>It's always the same.</t728> <t729>Perhaps, I think, there is also someone, a special someone lost, in her memory; a man, or a child.</t729> <t730>But I can't naively believe it.</t730> <t731>I think she is the type of person whose every move is a performance, every gesture calculated for effect.</t731> <t732>She does it for appearances, I think.</t732> <t733>She is willing to exploit every gesture of hers.</t733>
<t734>But surely I am the same in her eyes.</t734> <t735>How could it be any different?</t735>
<t736>Now we have turned our backs to the church and are facing what we truly came to visit: The wall.</t736>
<t737>The wall is also many hundreds of years old; or at least more than a hundred.</t737> <t738>Like the sidewalk, the wall is built of red bricks, and it must have been bare but beautiful in the past.</t738> <t739>Now the gates have guards and newly installed floodlights, ugly, on high iron posts, barbed wire running along the base of the wall, and broken glass embedded in the cement layer on top.</t739>
<t740>No one enters through these gates without permission.</t740> <t741>The precautionary measures are to prevent those who want to escape, even though reaching the Wall from the inside, bypassing the electronic alarm system, is almost impossible.</t741>
<t742>By the main gate, there are six more bodies swaying, ropes around their necks, hands tied together in front of their bellies, heads wrapped in white bags lolling to the side over their shoulders.</t742> <t743>There must have been a Men's Salvaging this morning.</t743> <t744>I didn't hear the bells.</t744> <t745>Probably because I'm used to it by now.</t745>
<t746>We stopped, all at once, as if on command, and stood still looking up at the bodies.</t746> <t747>There's no harm in looking.</t747> <t748>In fact, we need to look: they are hung here, on this Wall, precisely for that reason.</t748> <t749>Sometimes they stay here for several days, until a new batch arrives, so that as many people as possible have the chance to see them.</t749>
<t750>The bodies hung on hooks.</t750> <t751>Hooks were added to the brick layer of the Wall specifically for this purpose.</t751> <t752>There are still empty hooks.</t752> <t753>The hooks look like aids for amputees.</t753> <t754>Or like inverted, horizontal steel question marks.</t754>
<t755>It is the head-wrapping bags that are the most terrifying, even more so than the faces hidden inside.</t755> <t756>They make these people look like faceless dolls; like scarecrows, which in a way they are, as they are placed here to instill fear.</t756> <t757>Or as if their heads were just bags, stuffed with some soft, fluffy substance, like flour or dough.</t757> <t758>That's because of the palpable weight of the heads, the emptiness, the weight pulling them down without the life to hold them upright.</t758> <t759>These heads are zeros.</t759>
<t760>Even if you look for a long time, as we are doing here, you can still distinguish the faint outlines behind the white cloth, like gray shadows.</t760> <t761>Their heads are like snowmen's heads, when the coal eyes and carrot nose have fallen off.</t761> <t762>These heads are melting.</t762>
<t763>But on one bag, there was blood, seeping through the white fabric, where the mouth should be.</t763> <t764>It outlined a second mouth, a small red one, as if a group of kindergarten children had used a thick marker to color it in.</t764> <t765>The concept of a childlike smile.</t765> <t766>This blood-red smiling mouth is what ultimately catches the eye.</t766> <t767>After all, it is not a snowman.</t767>
<t768>These people are wearing white coats, like doctors or scientists.</t768> <t769>It's not just doctors and scientists, there are others too, but surely there was a purge of them this morning.</t769> <t770>A sign hangs around each person's neck indicating the crime for which they are being judged: a drawing of a human fetus.</t770> <t771>So they are doctors, from the past, back when those things were still legal.</t771> <t772>The creators of Angels, they were called that, or something else? Now they are brought to light thanks to investigations in hospital records, or - more likely, since most hospitals destroyed all such documents as soon as people realized what was about to happen - thanks to informants: a former nurse, for example, or rather two, since now the testimony of a single woman is no longer accepted; or another doctor, trying to save their own life; or someone already convicted, throwing out the name of an old enemy, or randomly naming someone else, desperately bargaining for safety.</t772> <t773>Although informants are not always granted clemency.</t773>
<t774>Those people, we were taught, are like war criminals.</t774> <t775>It cannot be excused that what they did was legal at the time: this criminal regulation has retroactive effect.</t775> <t776>They did immoral things and must be made an example of, for the rest.</t776> <t777>Though it's not much needed.</t777> <t778>Women, these days, no one in their right mind would try to avoid childbirth - assuming she is lucky enough to conceive.</t778>
<t779>In front of those corpses, they wanted us to feel hatred and contempt.</t779> <t780>That was not how I felt.</t780> <t781>The corpses on the Wall were those who transcended time, lost from another era.</t781> <t782>They came here from the past.</t782>
<t783>My feeling is numbness.</t783> <t784>My feeling is not to have any feeling.</t784> <t785>My feeling is also somewhat of relief, because Luke is not among them.</t785> <t786>Luke was not a doctor in the past.</t786> <t787>He is not a doctor.</t787>
<t788>I looked at the solitary red smiling mouth.</t788> <t789>That red color is also the color of the tulips in Serena Joy's garden, near the base of the flower where it starts to heal.</t789> <t790>The same red color but no connection, tulips are not made of blood, the red smiling mouth is not a flower, neither explains the other.</t790> <t791>One cannot deny the hanged man because of the flower, or vice versa.</t791> <t792>Each thing has its own reason for existence, and they all exist there.</t792> <t793>And through a forest full of such rational things, I have to choose my own path, each day, through each path.</t793> <t794>I put a lot of effort into those distinctions.</t794> <t795>I need them.</t795> <t796>I need to be clear, in my mind.</t796>
<t797>I felt a trembling running through the woman next to me.</t797> <t798>Was she crying?</t798> <t799>How could that help her appear in any way?</t799> <t800>I couldn't afford to find out.</t800> <t801>Here I am, gripping the handle of my bag tightly, I see that, I won't reveal anything.</t801>
<t802>Normally, Aunt Lydia said, it is what you are used to seeing happen.</t802> <t803>Right now, you may think it is not normal, but after a while, it will be different.</t803> <t804>It will become normal.</t804>
<t805>III - Night</t805>
<t806>7</t806>
<t807>The night belongs to me, my own time, to do whatever I want, as long as it's quiet.</t807> <t808>As long as I'm still.</t808> <t809>As long as I lie still.</t809> <t810>What's the difference between lying down and sleeping.</t810> <t811>Sleeping can still sometimes be intentional.</t811> <t812>Didn't men in the past say, I want to sleep with her.</t812> <t813>Though sometimes they also said, I want her to let me sleep.</t813> <t814>All of this is purely speculation.</t814> <t815>I don't know for sure what men in the past said.</t815> <t816>Whatever they said, that's what I know.</t816>
<t817>So I lay there, in the room, under the plaster eye on the ceiling, behind the white curtains, amidst the bed sheets, absolutely pristine, and stepped aside, out of my own time.</t817> <t818>Out of all systems of time.</t818> <t819>Even though this is time, I did not step out of it.</t819>
<t820>But night is the time for me to go out.</t820> <t821>Where should I go?</t821>
<t822>Where is beautiful.</t822>
<t823>Moira, sitting on the edge of my bed, her right leg propped up on her left knee, wearing purple overalls, one earring dangling, her nails painted yellow to look different, a cigarette clamped between her chubby fingers, the tips stained yellow.</t823> <t824>Let's go get a beer.</t824> <t825>You're getting ashes all over my bed, I said.</t825>
<t826>If it had gone smoothly, you wouldn't have encountered this, Moira said.</t826>
<t827>Half an hour more, I said.</t827> <t828>I have an assignment due tomorrow.</t828> <t829>What kind of assignment? Psychology, English, economics.</t829> <t830>We studied those kinds of subjects back then.</t830> <t831>The floor was covered with books, face down, everywhere, scattered.</t831>
<t832>Go now, Moira said.</t832> <t833>No need to put on any makeup, just me.</t833> <t834>What article are you writing? I just finished one about post-date rape.</t834>
<t835>Post-date rape, I said.</t835> <t836>You're quite modern, aren't you? Sounds like a new trend among the youth.</t836> <t837>Post-date rape.</t837>
<t838>Ha ha, Moira replied.</t838> <t839>Put your clothes on.</t839>
<t840>She went to get the shirt and threw it to me herself.</t840> <t841>Can I borrow five dollars, okay?</t841>
<t842>Or somewhere in the park, beside my mother.</t842> <t843>How old was I then?</t843> <t844>It was cold, my breath visible in the air, the trees bare; the sky dark, two ducks in the pond, melancholic.</t844> <t845>Bread crumbs under my fingers, in my pocket.</t845> <t846>That's right: mother said we came to feed the ducks.</t846>
<t847>But there are some women burning books, that's the real reason mom came here.</t847> <t848>To meet her friend; she lied to me, Saturday was supposed to be my day. I turned my back on her, sulking, intending to go out to the ducks, but the fire drew me back.</t848>
<t849>There were men too, among the women, and those were not books but magazines. They must have poured gasoline, as the flames rose very high, and then they started stuffing the magazines in, little by little, pouring them out of the box.</t849> <t850>Some murmured, while the idlers gathered around to watch.</t850>
<t851>They looked so happy, almost ecstatic.</t851> <t852>That's what fire does.</t852> <t853>Even mother's face, usually pale and thin, was rosy and cheerful, like on a Christmas card; and there was another woman, large, with a streak of ash on her face and an orange knitted hat.</t853> <t854>I remember her well.</t854>
<t855>Throwing a book in, isn't it small? she asked.</t855> <t856>How old was I then?</t856>
<t857>Trash must be burned to be clean, she said, giggling.</t857> <t858>Right? she asked my mother.</t858>
<t859>It's up to her, mom said; she always talked to others about me as if I wasn't there.</t859>
<t860>The lady gave me a book.</t860> <t861>On it was a very beautiful woman, not wearing anything, hanging from the ceiling by a chain wrapped around her wrist.</t861> <t862>I curiously observed.</t862> <t863>It did not scare me.</t863> <t864>I thought she was swinging, like Tarzan swinging on vines, on TV.</t864>
<t865>Don't let the child see that, mother said.</t865> <t866>Here, mother told me, throw it in here, quickly.</t866>
<t867>I threw the magazine into the fire.</t867> <t868>It fluttered open due to the hot air rising from its own burning, large pieces of paper detached, flying into the air, still burning fiercely, fragments of a woman's body, turning into gray ash, right in the air, before my eyes.</t868>
<t869>But then what happened, but then what happened?</t869>
<t870>I know I have wasted time.</t870>
<t871>There must be needles, pills, or something like that.</t871> <t872>I can't lose that much time just because of myself.</t872> <t873>You had a fainting spell, they said.</t873>
<t874>Then I rose through the roar and chaos, like crashing white waves.</t874> <t875>I still remember being quite calm.</t875> <t876>I still remember screaming, feeling like screaming even though it might have been just a whisper, Where is it?</t876> <t877>What did you do to it?</t877>
<t878>Neither day nor night, just a dim light.</t878> <t879>A moment later, the chair, and the bed, and then the window reappeared.</t879>
<t880>It is being well taken care of, they said.</t880> <t881>In the hands of capable people.</t881> <t882>She wasn't capable, but she wanted to give it the best.</t882> <t883>Or did she?</t883>
<t884>They showed me a picture of the child, standing outside on the grass, face framed by an oval of hair.</t884> <t885>The bright hair was swept back and tied tightly behind the head.</t885> <t886>Holding the child's hand was a stranger.</t886> <t887>The child only reached the woman's elbow.</t887>
<t888>You killed it, I said.</t888> <t889>It looks like an angel, solemn, condensed, from the air.</t889>
<t890>The child is wearing a dress I have never seen before, white, covering down to the feet.</t890>
<t891>I want to believe that I am just telling a story.</t891> <t892>I need to believe that.</t892> <t893>I have to believe that.</t893> <t894>Anyone who can believe that a story is just a story will have a better chance.</t894>
<t895>If I'm just telling a story, I have full control over the ending.</t895> <t896>So there will be an ending to the story, and then real life will resume.</t896> <t897>I can continue from where I left off.</t897>
<t898>This is not me telling a story.</t898>
<t899>This is also me telling a story, in my head; while still continuing to live.</t899>
<t900>Tell, not write, because I have nothing to write with and writing is forbidden anyway.</t900> <t901>But if it's storytelling, even if only in my head, it must be that I am telling it to someone.</t901> <t902>No one tells a story just to themselves.</t902> <t903>There is always a second person.</t903>
<t904>Even if there is no one.</t904>
<t905>A story is told just like a letter.</t905> <t906>Oh person, I say.</t906> <t907>Just a person, no name.</t907> <t908>Attaching a name means the person is tied to the real world, inviting fortune and peril: who knows how much luck is out there, for survival, for the person?</t908> <t909>I will say oh person, oh person, like an old love song.</t909> <t910>Person can mean more than one person.</t910>
<t911>One can point out thousands.</t911>
<t912>Now that I am not in immediate danger, I will tell you.</t912>
<t913>I will pretend like someone hears me.</t913>
<t914>But it's no use, because I know the person can't hear.</t914>
<t915>IV - Waiting Room</t915>
<t916>8</t916>
<t917>The beautiful weather still lingers.</t917> <t918>It's as if it's already June, making me want to pull out my sunglasses and sandals to go buy an ice cream cone.</t918> <t919>There are three new bodies on the Wall.</t919> <t920>One is a priest, still wearing a black cassock.</t920> <t921>It was put on him when he was taken to court, even though they had stopped wearing it years ago when the sectarian strife began; the clerical robe clearly marked them.</t921> <t922>The other two had purple signs around their necks: Gender Traitor.</t922> <t923>The bodies were still in Guardian uniforms.</t923> <t924>Caught in the act, surely, but where?</t924> <t925>In the barracks, in the bathroom? Hard to guess.</t925> <t926>The snowman with the red smile has been taken down.</t926>
<t927>"Let's go back," I told Ofglen.</t927> <t928>It's always me who speaks up.</t928> <t929>Sometimes I think if I didn't say anything, she would stand here forever.</t929> <t930>But to mourn, or to revel?</t930> <t931>I still can't figure it out.</t931>
<t932>Without saying a word, she turned around, as if controlled by a voice, as if small oiled wheels were attached to her feet, like a doll in a music box.</t932> <t933>I despise this gracefulness.</t933> <t934>I despise the gentle head, bowed low as if before a strong wind.</t934> <t935>But there is no wind.</t935>
<t936>We left the Wall, retracing our steps along the path we came, in the warm sunlight.</t936>
<t937>“A very beautiful day in May,” Ofglen said.</t937> <t938>I felt, rather than saw, her head turn towards me, waiting for a reply.</t938>
<t939>“Indeed,” I said.</t939> <t940>“Glory be,” I added, as if reconsidering.</t940> <t941>Day month year. Mayday.</t941> <t942>It used to be a distress signal, from a long time ago, one of those wars we learned about in school.</t942> <t943>I constantly mix them up, but I can distinguish them by aircraft if I pay close attention.</t943> <t944>But it was Luke who told me about “mayday.”</t944> <t945>Mayday, mayday, for pilots when their planes were hit, and ships - ships too, right? - at sea.</t945> <t946>It seems like SOS was for ships.</t946> <t947>I wish I could look that up.</t947> <t948>And a piece of Beethoven’s music, people before knew about victory, in one of those wars.</t948>
<t949>Do you know where it comes from? Luke said.</t949> <t950>"Mayday" that is?</t950>
<t951>No, I said.</t951> <t952>Using that word here is a bit strange, isn't it?</t952>
<t953>Morning newspaper and coffee, Sunday mornings, before our child was born.</t953> <t954>There were still newspapers back then.</t954> <t955>We often read them right in bed.</t955>
<t956>That's French, he said.</t956> <t957>It transforms into "m'aidez."</t957>
<t958>Save me.</t958>
<t959>A small convoy is approaching us, a funeral: three women, each with a thin black veil draped over the scarf on her head.</t959> <t960>One is a Frugal Wife and the other two, relatives, are also Frugal Wives, probably her friends.</t960> <t961>The striped dresses are worn out, and so are the faces.</t961> <t962>One day, when times are better, Aunt Lydia says, no one will have to be a Frugal Wife anymore.</t962>
<t963>Leading the procession was the mourner, the mother; she held a small black urn.</t963> <t964>The size of the urn indicated how much it had grown before fading away, inside her, drifting straight to the realm of death.</t964> <t965>Two or three months, too small to determine if it was a stillborn or not.</t965> <t966>The older ones, those who died at birth, would be placed in a box.</t966>
<t967>We stopped, showing respect, as they passed by.</t967> <t968>I don't know if Ofglen felt the same as I did, a pain like being stabbed, right in the stomach.</t968> <t969>We placed our hands on our left chests so that those unfamiliar women would understand that we sympathized with their loss.</t969> <t970>Under the veil, the leading woman glared.</t970> <t971>One of the other two turned away and spat on the sidewalk.</t971> <t972>The frugal Wives did not like us.</t972>
<t973>We passed by the shops and reached the barrier, and were allowed through.</t973> <t974>We continued walking between large buildings with empty exteriors, and lawns free of weeds.</t974> <t975>At the corner near the house where I serve, Ofglen stopped and turned to me.</t975>
<t976>“In his eyes,” she said.</t976> <t977>The perfect farewell.</t977>
<t978>“In His eyes,” I replied, and she nodded slightly.</t978> <t979>She hesitated, as if intending to say more, but then turned away and walked down the street.</t979> <t980>I watched her.</t980> <t981>She seemed like a reflection of me, in a mirror I was gradually moving away from.</t981>
<t982>On the driveway, Nick was scrubbing the Cyclone again.</t982> <t983>He had scrubbed up to the chrome tail section.</t983> <t984>I placed my gloved hand on the gate latch, opened it, and pushed in. The gate clicked shut behind me.</t984> <t985>The tulips at the edge of the garden were redder than ever, blooming large, no longer goblets but big cups; stretching themselves up, where do they want to go?</t985> <t986>After all, they are all wild.</t986> <t987>When they age, they turn outward, then slowly burst open, petals drooping like fragments.</t987>
<t988>Nick looked up and started whistling.</t988> <t989>Then he asked, "Did you have fun?"</t989>
<t990>I nodded, but did not speak in reply.</t990> <t991>He was not allowed to talk to me.</t991> <t992>Of course, some will try, Aunt Lydia said.</t992> <t993>Flesh is weak.</t993> <t994>Flesh is grass, I corrected in my mind.</t994> <t995>They can't help it, she said, God made them that way but God did not make you that way.</t995> <t996>God made you different.</t996> <t997>Setting boundaries is up to you.</t997> <t998>Then you will be thanked later.</t998>
<t999>In the backyard, the Commander's Wife is sitting in a chair that has been brought out.</t999> <t1000>Serena Joy, what a stupid name. "Serene Joy"; sounds like something you would put on your hair, back then, long ago, to win.</t1000> <t1001>Serena Joy, the words on the label, the silhouette of a woman's head on a pink oval background, with wavy gold edges.</t1001> <t1002>There are all kinds of names in the world to choose from, why choose this one?</t1002> <t1003>Her real name was never Serena</t1003>
<t1004>Joy, since back then.</t1004> <t1005>Her real name was Pam. I read it in her biography, in a news magazine, long after the first time I saw her sing while my mother slept in on a Sunday morning.</t1005> <t1006>By then, she was significant enough to warrant a biography: The Times or Newsweek, something like that.</t1006> <t1007>By then, she no longer sang but gave speeches.</t1007> <t1008>She was very good at it.</t1008> <t1009>She spoke about the sanctity of the family, encouraging women to stay at home.</t1009> <t1010>Serena Joy herself did not stay at home but went around making speeches, though she considered this failure a personal sacrifice for the welfare of all.</t1010>
<t1011>During that time, someone attempted to shoot her but missed; the secretary, who was standing right behind, died in her place.</t1011> <t1012>Another person planted a car bomb for her but it exploded too early.</t1012> <t1013>There were even people who claimed she planted the car bomb herself to gain sympathy.</t1013> <t1014>The situation had become that tense.</t1014>
<t1015>Luke and I sometimes saw her on the nightly news.</t1015> <t1016>Bathrobe, nightcap.</t1016> <t1017>We watched her hair come undone and her frenzy, and the tears she could summon at will, and the mascara running down her cheeks.</t1017> <t1018>By then, she wore much heavier makeup.</t1018> <t1019>We found her somewhat amusing.</t1019> <t1020>Or at least Luke found her amusing.</t1020> <t1021>I just pretended to think so.</t1021> <t1022>In truth, I found her a bit frightening.</t1022> <t1023>She was sincere from start to finish.</t1023>
<t1024>Now she no longer speaks.</t1024> <t1025>She has become silent.</t1025> <t1026>She is at home, but it seems that it does not suit her.</t1026> <t1027>Now how furious she must be, when her mouth wants to open but her jaw is stuck.</t1027>
<t1028>She is looking at the tulips.</t1028> <t1029>The cane lies beside her, on the grass.</t1029> <t1030>Half of her face is turned towards me, I noticed this when I cast a quick sideways glance while passing by.</t1030> <t1031>Staring for long does no good.</t1031> <t1032>It is no longer the round, well-defined face; her face is now in the process of hollowing out, and I think of towns built on underground water sources, rows and rows of houses and streets disappearing overnight, turning into a sudden swamp, or mining towns collapsing into the mines beneath them.</t1032> <t1033>Surely something similar has happened to her, once she saw the true nature of what was coming.</t1033>
<t1034>She did not turn her head.</t1034> <t1035>She did not show any sign of seeing me, even though she knew I was there.</t1035> <t1036>I understood clearly that she knew, it was like that smell, her knowing: a sour smell, like spoiled milk.</t1036>
<t1037>It's not the husbands you need to keep an eye on, Aunt Lydia said, but the Wives.</t1037> <t1038>You must always try to imagine how they are feeling.</t1038> <t1039>Of course, they will kill you.</t1039> <t1040>That's only natural.</t1040> <t1041>Try to sympathize with them.</t1041> <t1042>Aunt Lydia thought she was very good at sympathizing with others.</t1042> <t1043>Try to love them.</t1043> <t1044>Forgive them, for they know not what they do.</t1044> <t1045>Once again, the trembling smile, like a beggar, the nearsighted blinking, the eyes looking up, through the steel-rimmed round glasses, towards the back of the classroom, as if the blue-painted plaster ceiling were opening up and God on a pink pearl cloud of face powder were descending through the tangle of wires and fire sprinkler heads.</t1045> <t1046>You must understand that they are failed women.</t1046> <t1047>They are incapable...</t1047>
<t1048>At this point, Aunt's voice broke, followed by a brief silence, and I heard a collective sigh rising around.</t1048> <t1049>Rustling or fidgeting during the silence was unwise: Aunt Lydia seemed absent-minded, but she watched every movement.</t1049> <t1050>Therefore, there were only sighs.</t1050>
<t1051>The future lies in your hands, aunt summed up.</t1051> <t1052>Her hand reached out to us, an ancient gesture both offering and inviting, come here, into the embrace, into the welcoming arms.</t1052> <t1053>In your hands, she said, looking down at her own hands, as if they had suggested it to her.</t1053> <t1054>But there was nothing in them.</t1054> <t1055>Her hands were empty.</t1055> <t1056>It is our hands that must be full of the future, a future that can be grasped, but not seen.</t1056>
<t1057>I walked around to the back door, opened it, went inside, and placed the basket on the kitchen table.</t1057> <t1058>The table had been scrubbed clean, not a trace of flour; today's batch of freshly baked bread was cooling on the rack.</t1058> <t1059>The kitchen exuded the smell of yeast, a scent of nostalgia.</t1059> <t1060>That smell reminded me of other kitchens, my kitchens. It was the smell of my mother; even though my mother never baked.</t1060> <t1061>It was my smell, from before, when I was still a mother.</t1061>
<t1062>It was a treacherous smell, and I knew I needed to banish it.</t1062>
<t1063>Rita is there, sitting by the table, peeling and chopping carrots.</t1063> <t1064>The carrots are old, very thick, stored through the winter, and have sprouted roots over time.</t1064> <t1065>The new carrots, soft and pale, still need a few more weeks.</t1065> <t1066>The knife in her hand is sharp and shiny, very tempting.</t1066> <t1067>I really want to have one too.</t1067>
<t1068>Rita stopped chopping carrots, stood up, and eagerly lifted the packages out of the basket.</t1068> <t1069>She was impatient to see what I had brought back, even though she always frowned when unwrapping them.</t1069> <t1070>Nothing I brought back ever completely satisfied her.</t1070> <t1071>She thought she could do much better if it were her.</t1071> <t1072>If only she could go shopping herself, bringing back exactly what she wanted; she envied my trips.</t1072> <t1073>In this house, everyone envies something about someone else.</t1073>
<t1074>“There are some oranges,” I said.</t1074> <t1075>“At the Milk and Honey shop, there are still a few left.”</t1075> <t1076>I offered this idea to her as a tribute, I wanted to buy some goodwill.</t1076> <t1077>I saw the oranges yesterday, but I didn't tell Rita; she was too grumpy yesterday.</t1077> <t1078>“I'll get them tomorrow if you give me the orange coupons.”</t1078> <t1079>I handed her the chicken.</t1079> <t1080>Today she wanted roast meat, but it was all gone.</t1080>
<t1081>Rita grumbled, showing no sign of satisfaction or approval.</t1081> <t1082>She would think later, needing to understand that, when she could be alone and at ease.</t1082> <t1083>She untied the chicken, removing the wrapping paper.</t1083> <t1084>She pressed on the body, bent one wing, inserted her finger into the belly cavity, and searched for the giblets.</t1084> <t1085>The chicken lay there, headless and footless, with goosebumps as if it were shivering from the cold.</t1085>
<t1086>“Today is bath day,” Rita said, not looking at me.</t1086>
<t1087>Cora went into the kitchen from the storage room behind the house, where the brooms and floor brushes were kept.</t1087> <t1088>"Look, a chicken," she said, almost joyfully.</t1088>
<t1089>“Raise the bone,” Rita said, “but we have to endure it.</t1089><t1090>”</t1090>
<t1091>"Nothing more," I said.</t1091> <t1092>Rita ignored it.</t1092>
<t1093>"I think that's big enough," Cora said.</t1093> <t1094>Was she defending me?</t1094> <t1095>I looked at her, to see if I should smile; but no, she was just thinking about the food.</t1095> <t1096>She was younger than Rita; the sunlight, slanting in through the west window, highlighted her hair parted in the middle and tied back.</t1096> <t1097>She used to be beautiful, not long ago.</t1097> <t1098>There were two small marks, like dimples, on her ears, where the earring holes had healed.</t1098>
<t1099>“Big,” Rita said, “but all bones.”</t1099> <t1100>“You should have said something,” she said, looking directly at me for the first time.</t1100> <t1101>“You must belong to that mediocre bunch.”</t1101> <t1102>She meant the status of the Commander.</t1102> <t1103>But in another sense, her sense, she thought I belonged to the mediocre type.</t1103> <t1104>She was over sixty, all her prejudices firmly entrenched.</t1104>
<t1105>She went to the sink, waved her hand under the faucet, and dampened the dish towel.</t1105> <t1106>The towel was white with blue stripes.</t1106> <t1107>The dish towel was just like before.</t1107> <t1108>Sometimes those fleeting everyday moments hit me off guard, like an ambush.</t1108> <t1109>The ordinary, the familiar, something reminiscent, like a punch.</t1109> <t1110>I saw the towel, detached from its context, and held my breath.</t1110> <t1111>For some, in some way, not much has changed.</t1111>
<t1112>“Who wants to take a bath?” Rita asked Cora, not me.</t1112> <t1113>“I need to soften this bird first.”</t1113>
<t1114>“I will do it later,” Cora said, “when I finish dusting.</t1114><t1115>”</t1115>
<t1116>“Why stop when it's done,” Rita said.</t1116>
<t1117>They talk about me as if I can't hear them.</t1117> <t1118>To them, I am just a household chore, among many other tasks.</t1118>
<t1119>I was dismissed.</t1119> <t1120>I picked up the basket, left the kitchen, and walked down the hall towards my grandfather's clock.</t1120> <t1121>The door to the lounge was closed.</t1121> <t1122>Sunlight streamed through the semi-circular archway, casting colorful hues on the floor: red, blue, and purple.</t1122> <t1123>I hesitated to step in, spreading my hands wide: my hands were filled with sunlight flowers.</t1123> <t1124>I went up the stairs: my face, distant, pale, and distorted, trapped within the long mirror, bulging like an eye being pressed.</t1124> <t1125>I followed the pink and gray carpet along the long upstairs hallway, back to my room.</t1125>
<t1126>There is someone standing in the hallway, near the door to my room. The hallway is dimly lit, this person is a man, his back turned to me; he is looking into the room, the light spilling out making his figure dark.</t1126> <t1127>Now I see, it is the Commander, he shouldn't be here.</t1127> <t1128>He hears me coming, turns around, hesitates, and steps forward, towards me.</t1128> <t1129>He is breaking the rules, what should I do?</t1129>
<t1130>I stopped, he stopped walking, I couldn't see his face, he was looking at me, what did he want?</t1130> <t1131>But then he moved forward, stepped aside to avoid bumping into me, slightly tilted his head, and walked away.</t1131>
<t1132>I was shown something, but what was it? Like the national flag of an unknown country, briefly appearing behind the hill.</t1132> <t1133>It could be an attack, it could be a negotiation, it could be a boundary, a strange territory.</t1133> <t1134>Signals between animals: blue eyelids lowered, ears pulled back, feathers on the neck raised.</t1134> <t1135>Fangs flashed, what the hell does he think he's doing? No one saw him.</t1135> <t1136>Hopefully.</t1136> <t1137>Had he intruded? Had he entered my room? I called it my room.</t1137>
<t1138>9</t1138>
<t1139>Yes, it is my room.</t1139> <t1140>After all, I must have a place to call my own, even in these times.</t1140>
<t1141>I am waiting, in my room, right now it is a waiting room.</t1141> <t1142>When I go to sleep, it will be a bedroom.</t1142> <t1143>The curtains are still swaying in the gentle breeze, the sun outside is still shining, though not directly into the room.</t1143> <t1144>The sun has shifted to the West. I am trying not to tell a story, or at least not this story.</t1144>
<t1145>Someone has lived in this room, before me.</t1145> <t1146>Someone like me, or at least I want to believe so.</t1146>
<t1147>I discovered it three days after arriving here.</t1147>
<t1148>I have a lot of time to kill.</t1148> <t1149>I decided to explore the room.</t1149> <t1150>Not in a hurry, the kind of hurry in a hotel room, not expecting any surprises, opening and closing every drawer and cupboard door, unwrapping each tiny bar of soap, pressing into the pillow.</t1150> <t1151>Will I ever stay in a hotel room again? I have wasted so much, those rooms, that freedom without anyone watching.</t1151>
<t1152>Indulge in renting.</t1152>
<t1153>In the afternoons, when Luke still had to hide from his wife, when I was still a phantom.</t1153> <t1154>Before we got married and I took shape.</t1154> <t1155>I always arrived first, checked into the room.</t1155> <t1156>Not many times, but now it feels like it was a decade ago, a millennium ago; I still remember what I wore, each piece of clothing, each scarf.</t1156> <t1157>I would pace back and forth, waiting for him, turning the TV on and off, dabbing perfume behind my ears, Opium I recall.</t1157> <t1158>Contained in a Chinese bottle, red and yellow.</t1158>
<t1159>I was anxious.</t1159> <t1160>How could I have known then that he loved me?</t1160> <t1161>It could very well have been just that kind of relationship.</t1161> <t1162>Why do we say "just"? Even back then, men and women would try each other out, aimlessly, like trying on clothes, discarding what didn't fit.</t1162>
<t1163>Then there will be a knock on the door; I will go to open it, feeling both relieved and eager.</t1163> <t1164>How brief you are, how concise you are.</t1164> <t1165>Yet you also seem endless.</t1165> <t1166>We will lie on the afternoon beds, once finished, hands resting on each other, discussing back and forth.</t1166> <t1167>Possible, impossible.</t1167> <t1168>What can be done?</t1168> <t1169>We thought we faced insurmountable problems.</t1169> <t1170>How did we know then that we were happy?</t1170>
<t1171>But now I even miss those rooms, miss those terrifying paintings on the walls, depicting scenes of autumn leaves falling or snow melting in the dense forest, or women dressed in vintage attire, porcelain doll faces, hoop skirts, and parasols, or sad-faced clowns, or bowls of fruit, stiff and chalky.</t1171> <t1172>Pristine white towels waiting to be ruined, trash bins gaping open, inviting, anticipating careless trash to be thrown in. Careless indeed.</t1172> <t1173>I used to be careless, in those rooms.</t1173> <t1174>Just a lift of the phone and food would appear on a tray, food of my choosing.</t1174> <t1175>Food that was certainly not good for health, of course, and drinks too.</t1175> <t1176>There were religious books in the wardrobe, placed by some charitable organization, though it was obvious hardly anyone touched them.</t1176> <t1177>There were also postcards, with pictures of the hotel, which you could write on and send to anyone.</t1177> <t1178>Such an impossible thing to do now; like a product of imagination.</t1178>
<t1179>So, I have explored this room, not in a hurry, like in a hotel room, not wastefully. I don't want to understand it all at once; I want it to last.</t1179> <t1180>I divide the room into sections, in my mind, reserving one section for myself each day.</t1180> <t1181>I will examine that section meticulously: the uneven layer beneath the wallpaper, the scratches on the baseboards and window sills, beneath the top layer of paint, the stains on the mattress, because I also turn over the blanket and sheets, rolling them back, a little at a time, so I can quickly put them back if someone comes.</t1181>
<t1182>The stain on the mattress.</t1182> <t1183>Like dried petals. It's been a long time.</t1183> <t1184>Old love; in this room now, there is no other way to love.</t1184>
<t1185>When I saw it, the evidence left by two people, about love or something similar, at least desire, at least touch, between two people who might have been old or dead, I covered the bed and lay on top of it.</t1185> <t1186>I looked up at the blind plaster eye on the ceiling.</t1186> <t1187>I wanted to feel Luke lying next to me.</t1187> <t1188>I still encounter them, the attacks from the past, like a trance, like waves crashing over my head.</t1188> <t1189>Many times it is really hard to bear.</t1189> <t1190>What to do, what to do, I thought.</t1190> <t1191>Nothing can be done.</t1191> <t1192>They also serve Him, even those who only stand and wait.</t1192> <t1193>Or lie still and wait.</t1193> <t1194>I know why the window is fitted with unbreakable glass, and why they removed the chandelier.</t1194> <t1195>I wanted to feel Luke lying next to me, but there wasn't enough room.</t1195>
<t1196>I kept the cupboard until the third day.</t1196> <t1197>I looked carefully at the door first, inside and out, then the cupboard walls with brass hooks - why did they overlook the hooks? Why didn't they remove them?</t1197> <t1198>Too close to the floor?</t1198> <t1199>But what's the big deal, a long sock, that's all it takes.</t1199> <t1200>And the horizontal rod hanging plastic hangers, my clothes hanging there, the sleeveless red wool cloak for cold weather, the shawl.</t1200> <t1201>I knelt down to examine the cupboard floor, and there, tiny letters, still quite new, scratched with a needle or maybe just a fingernail, in the corner shrouded in the thickest darkness: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t1201>
<t1202>I don't know what it means, I don't even know what language it is.</t1202> <t1203>I guess it could be Latin, but I don't know Latin.</t1203> <t1204>Anyway, it's still a message, a message in writing, which alone is enough to make it a forbidden object, and until now it hasn't been discovered.</t1204> <t1205>Except by me, the one it was sent to.</t1205> <t1206>It was sent to anyone who comes after.</t1206>
<t1207>Thinking about this message secretly amused me. I was amused to think that I was communicating with her, the secret woman.</t1207><t1208>For she was indeed a secret, or if known at all, no one had ever mentioned her to me.</t1208><t1209>I was delighted to know that her forbidden message had passed through, reaching at least one other person, when placed and stuck on my locker door, had been opened and read by me.</t1209><t1210>Sometimes I repeated each word to myself.</t1210><t1211>They brought a small joy.</t1211><t1212>When imagining the woman who wrote this line, I pictured her around my age, maybe a little younger.</t1212><t1213>I turned her into Moira, Moira from college, in the room next to mine: playful, lively, a former cyclist, and a backpacker who often went hiking.</t1213><t1214>Freckled, I imagined; fond of mocking, full of schemes.</t1214>
<t1215>I wonder who Miss Tung is, who she is now, and what she has become.</t1215>
<t1216>I tried to exploit Rita, the day I found the message.</t1216>
<t1217>Who was the person who stayed in that room? I asked.</t1217> <t1218>Before me? What if I had asked differently, what if I had asked, Was there someone in that room before me?</t1218> <t1219>It might not have led anywhere.</t1219>
<t1220>Which girl? she asked; her voice was hostile, suspicious, but then again, she almost always spoke to me in that tone.</t1220>
<t1221>It means there is not just one person.</t1221> <t1222>Some people do not stay for the entire two-year term.</t1222> <t1223>Some people have had to move away, for some reason.</t1223> <t1224>Or not move away - but leave?</t1224>
<t1225>That girl is clever.</t1225> <t1226>I am groping.</t1226> <t1227>That girl has freckles.</t1227>
<t1228>Do you know her?</t1228> <t1229>Rita asked, more suspicious than ever.</t1229>
<t1230>In the past, I lied.</t1230> <t1231>I heard that she was here.</t1231>
<t1232>Rita accepted this statement.</t1232> <t1233>She understood that there must exist a network of information, some form of underground communication.</t1233>
<t1234>She did not succeed, she said.</t1234>
<t1235>How exactly? I asked, the more indifferent you are, the better.</t1235> <t1236>But Rita had pressed her lips tightly together.</t1236> <t1237>In this house, I am like a child; there are things that are not told to me.</t1237> <t1238>What you don't know won't hurt you, she would just say that.</t1238>
<t1239>10</t1239>
<t1240>Sometimes I sing to myself, in my head: something truly sorrowful, melancholy, tinged with the Elder:</t1240>
<t1241>Grace unparalleled, a mystical sound.</t1241>
<t1242>Save this poor person's child.</t1242>
<t1243>Wandered astray, but now back on the path.</t1243>
<t1244>Breaking the old chains, now free again.</t1244>
<t1245>I don't know if the words are correct.</t1245> <t1246>I can't remember.</t1246> <t1247>Those kinds of songs are no longer sung widely, especially if they contain words like "freedom".</t1247> <t1248>They are classified as extremely dangerous.</t1248> <t1249>They belong to illegal sects.</t1249>
<t1250>Too lonely, darling,</t1250>
<t1251>Too lonely.</t1251>
<t1252>Lonely and sad, I feel like dying.</t1252>
<t1253>This entire piece is also illegal.</t1253> <t1254>I learned it from one of my mother's old cassette tapes; she had a rickety, temperamental player that could still play those tapes.</t1254> <t1255>She often played the tapes when friends came over for a get-together.</t1255>
<t1256>I rarely sing like this.</t1256> <t1257>It makes my throat hurt.</t1257>
<t1258>In this house, there is little music, except for what is played on the TV.</t1258> <t1259>Sometimes Rita hums to herself while kneading dough or peeling vegetables: a tuneless, toneless, measureless melody.</t1259> <t1260>And sometimes, from the main sitting room, the thin voice of Serena Joy can be heard, from a very old record played very softly, so no one catches her listening while she knits, reminiscing about the severed glories of the past: Hallelujah.</t1260>
<t1261>Compared to this month, the weather is quite warm.</t1261> <t1262>Houses built in this style get extremely hot when it's sunny, the insulation is not sufficient.</t1262> <t1263>The air around me feels stifling, even though a light breeze is blowing through the curtains.</t1263> <t1264>I almost want to push the door wide open. It's almost time to switch to summer clothes.</t1264>
<t1265>The summer shirts have been taken out of the package and hung in the closet, two of them, one hundred percent cotton, better than the cheap synthetic fabrics even though in the humid weather, around July and August, wearing them still makes you sweat.</t1265> <t1266>At least there's no need to worry about getting sunburned, Aunt Lydia said.</t1266> <t1267>Some silly things women like to do.</t1267> <t1268>Slathering oil all over themselves like skewered meat, baring their backs and shoulders, on the street, in front of everyone, even their legs, not even bothering with socks, no wonder those things pop up.</t1268> <t1269>Things, a word Aunt often used when what it represented was so disgusting or dirty or horrible that she couldn't allow it to pass her lips.</t1269> <t1270>A fulfilled life, according to Aunt, was one that avoided all things, eliminated all things.</t1270> <t1271>Those things don't appear in the lives of good women.</t1271> <t1272>It's also not good for the skin, not good at all, making them wrinkle like dried jujubes.</t1272> <t1273>But we are no longer allowed to care about our skin, this Aunt forgot.</t1273>
<t1274>In the park, Aunt Lydia said, lying sprawled on the blanket, sometimes men and women mingling together, and at that point she began to cry, still standing there in front of us, exposed.</t1274>
<t1275>I'm just trying my best, aunt said.</t1275> <t1276>I'm trying to give you girls the best chance possible.</t1276> <t1277>Aunt blinked, the light was too bright for her, her mouth quivered around her front teeth, slightly protruding, long and yellowed, and I remembered the dead rats found on the doorstep, back when we lived in a house, all three of us, plus the cat, the true author of those offerings.</t1277>
<t1278>Aunt Lydia put her hand over her dead mouse mouth.</t1278> <t1279>After a minute, she took her hand away.</t1279> <t1280>I also wanted to cry because she made me remember.</t1280> <t1281>If only she hadn't eaten half of it first, I told Luke.</t1281>
<t1282>Don't think it's easy for me either, Aunt Lydia said.</t1282>
<t1283>Moira burst into the room like the wind, dropping her cropped denim jacket on the floor.</t1283> <t1284>Do you have any cigarettes? she asked.</t1284>
<t1285>In that handbag, I said.</t1285> <t1286>But there are no matches.</t1286> <t1287>Moira rummaged through my bag.</t1287> <t1288>You should throw away this junk, she said.</t1288> <t1289>I'm about to host a lingerie party.</t1289>
<t1290>"What party?" I asked.</t1290> <t1291>Trying to work was futile, Moira wouldn't allow it; she was like a cat that loved to sit on the book just when someone was trying to read.</t1291>
<t1292>Um, it's like a Tupperware kitchenware party, but with lingerie instead.</t1292> <t1293>Exclusively for the gang of rascals.</t1293> <t1294>Lace-trimmed panties with garter belts, push-up bras.</t1294> <t1295>She found my lighter and lit a cigarette she took from my pocket.</t1295> <t1296>Want a puff?</t1296> <t1297>She tossed the stuff over, overly generous, considering it was all mine.</t1297>
<t1298>Countless thanks, I said sarcastically.</t1298> <t1299>You're crazy.</t1299> <t1300>Where did this idea come from?</t1300>
<t1301>Working just to get through college, Moira said.</t1301> <t1302>I have a lot of connections.</t1302> <t1303>My mom's friends. In the suburbs, it's quite bustling; as soon as they get a single gray hair, they think they need to compete fiercely.</t1303> <t1304>Then there's the sex toy supermarkets and all sorts of other things.</t1304>
<t1305>I laughed out loud.</t1305> <t1306>You always make me laugh.</t1306>
<t1307>But here? I said.</t1307> <t1308>Who will come? Who needs it here?</t1308>
<t1309>Learning has no age that's too early, she said.</t1309> <t1310>Get excited, it will be a lot of fun.</t1310> <t1311>We'll laugh our pants off, just wait and see.</t1311>
<t1312>Did we really live like that, back then?</t1312> <t1313>But we still lived as usual.</t1313> <t1314>Everyone did, generally always like that.</t1314> <t1315>No matter what was happening, it was still as usual.</t1315> <t1316>Even now, it's still as usual, like it is now.</t1316>
<t1317>We continued living, as usual, by ignoring it.</t1317> <t1318>It's not like someone was already absent-minded; that requires effort to achieve.</t1318>
<t1319>Nothing changes immediately: in a gradually heating bath, the bather will be boiled to death before they realize it.</t1319> <t1320>There are many stories in the newspapers, of course, bodies in sewers or forests, beaten to death with clubs or dismembered, violated, as people often say, but these are stories about certain women, and the men involved are also certain men.</t1320> <t1321>No one among the men we know.</t1321> <t1322>The stories in the newspapers are like dreams, like someone else's nightmare.</t1322> <t1323>It's horrifying, we say, and it truly is horrifying, but it's a horror that is hard to believe.</t1323> <t1324>They are too much like theater, they belong to a different dimension, not part of our lives.</t1324>
<t1325>We are the people who don't make it to the news.</t1325> <t1326>We live on the margins of blank paper.</t1326> <t1327>It's more free that way.</t1327>
<t1328>We live in the space between stories.</t1328>
<t1329>From below, the driveway, the sound echoed up, the family car was starting.</t1329> <t1330>This area is quiet, with few vehicles, every sound is heard very clearly: the sound of car engines, the sound of lawnmowers, the sound of hedge trimmers, the sound of doors slamming shut.</t1330> <t1331>Shouts would also be heard clearly, or gunshots, if they ever rang out here.</t1331> <t1332>Occasionally, in the distance, there is the sound of sirens.</t1332>
<t1333>I sat on the window sill, too cramped to be comfortable.</t1333> <t1334>There was a small, hard pillow placed there, with a cover embroidered in small stitches: FAITH, in capital letters, surrounded by a wreath of lilies. The word FAITH was in faded blue, and the lilies were in dull green.</t1334> <t1335>This pillow had been used elsewhere before, worn out but not yet worth discarding.</t1335> <t1336>I don't understand why people overlooked it.</t1336>
<t1337>I can sit for minutes, tens of minutes, staring at the words: FAITH.</t1337> <t1338>The only thing available for me to read.</t1338> <t1339>If I get caught doing this, will it matter?</t1339> <t1340>It's not like I placed the pillow here myself.</t1340>
<t1341>The engine roared, and I leaned forward, pulling the white curtain past my face, like a veil.</t1341> <t1342>The curtain was almost transparent, allowing visibility through it.</t1342> <t1343>If I pressed my forehead against the glass and looked down, I could see the rear half of the Cyclone.</t1343> <t1344>There was no one, but a moment later I saw Nick walking around to the back door, opening it, and standing beside it.</t1344> <t1345>Now his hat was straight, his hands down, carefully buttoning up.</t1345> <t1346>Looking down from above, I couldn't see his face.</t1346>
<t1347>The Commander is now leaving the house.</t1347> <t1348>I only caught a glimpse of him for a moment, briefly, as he was walking towards the car.</t1348> <t1349>He wasn't wearing a hat, so he wasn't attending any official meeting. His hair had turned gray.</t1349> <t1350>Gray hair, let's call it that to make him seem kind.</t1350> <t1351>I'm not in the mood to be kind.</t1351> <t1352>He used to be completely bald, so this could be considered an improvement.</t1352>
<t1353>If only I knew how to spit, from the window, or throw something down, like this pillow for instance, maybe it would hit him.</t1353>
<t1354>Moira and I, bags of paper filled with water.</t1354> <t1355>Water bombs, that's what we called them. Leaning out of the dorm window, throwing them down on the boys below.</t1355> <t1356>It was Moira's idea.</t1356> <t1357>What were they trying to do? Climbing up with a ladder, wanting to steal some things.</t1357> <t1358>Our underwear.</t1358>
<t1359>The dormitory used to be co-ed, and our floor still had a men's urinal attached to the wall in the bathroom.</t1359> <t1360>But by the time I got there, everything had been restored to its original state.</t1360>
<t1361>The commander bent down, got into the car, disappeared, and Nick closed the door.</t1361> <t1362>A second later, the car reversed, passed through the gate, went down the road, and disappeared behind the hedge.</t1362>
<t1363>I need to hate this person.</t1363> <t1364>I know I need to, but I really don't feel that way.</t1364> <t1365>My feelings are much more complicated.</t1365> <t1366>I don't know what to call it.</t1366> <t1367>It's not love.</t1367>
<t1368>11</t1368>
<t1369>Yesterday morning I went for a check-up.</t1369> <t1370>I was taken there by a Guardian, one of those with a red armband who specialize in this kind of task.</t1370> <t1371>We rode in a red car, he sat in the front seat, I sat in the back.</t1371> <t1372>There was no shadow accompanying me; on these occasions, I am alone.</t1372>
<t1373>I am taken for a check-up once a month, undergoing all sorts of tests: urine, hormones, cancer screening, blood tests; just like before, except now it's mandatory.</t1373>
<t1374>The clinic is located in a modern office building.</t1374> <t1375>We took the elevator up, silently, the Guard facing me.</t1375> <t1376>Looking at the glossy black elevator walls like a mirror, I could see the back of his neck.</t1376> <t1377>Upon reaching the clinic, I went inside; he waited outside, in the lobby, with the other Guards, on the row of chairs designated for them.</t1377>
<t1378>In the waiting room, there were a few other women, three in total, all dressed in red: this is a specialized clinic.</t1378> <t1379>We secretly looked at each other, measuring each other's bellies: is anyone lucky?</t1379> <t1380>The orderly entered our names and the numbers from our passes into the Italian computer, checking if anyone was falsely claiming an identity.</t1380> <t1381>He was six feet tall, around forty, with a scar crossing his cheek; he sat and typed, his hands oversized for the keyboard, a pistol still holstered on his shoulder.</t1381>
<t1382>When I heard my name called, I walked through the door into the inner room.</t1382> <t1383>The room was painted white, sparsely furnished, just like the outer room, except for a folding screen with red fabric stretched over the frame, depicting a golden Eye, with a sword entwined by two snakes standing upright below it, resembling a hilt.</t1383> <t1384>Snakes and sword, remnants of symbolic fragments.</t1384>
<t1385>After placing the small jar ready in the restroom compartment, I took off my clothes behind the screen, folded them neatly, and placed them on the chair.</t1385> <t1386>Naked as a jaybird, I lay on the examination table, on the crinkly disposable paper sheet.</t1386> <t1387>I pulled the second sheet, made of fabric, over myself.</t1387> <t1388>At neck level, there was another sheet, hanging down from the ceiling.</t1388> <t1389>It divided my body so the doctor couldn't see my face.</t1389> <t1390>He only worked with a body.</t1390>
<t1391>When everything was in place, I reached out, felt for the lever on the right side of the table, and pulled it.</t1391> <t1392>A bell would ring somewhere, but I couldn't hear it.</t1392> <t1393>A minute later, the door opened, footsteps entered, and there was breathing. He was not supposed to talk to me unless absolutely necessary.</t1393> <t1394>But this doctor was quite talkative.</t1394>
<t1395>“How are we doing?” he asked, a linguistic habit left over from the old days.</t1395> <t1396>The sheet was lifted off my skin, the draft making me break out in goosebumps.</t1396> <t1397>A finger, encased in rubber cold as jelly, slipped inside me, I was prodded, pressed.</t1397> <t1398>The finger withdrew, entered another way, then retreated.</t1398>
<t1399>“No issues at all,” the doctor said, as if speaking to himself.</t1399> <t1400>“Does it hurt anywhere, dear?” He called me dear.</t1400>
<t1401>"No," I said.</t1401>
<t1402>My chest was being squeezed and examined to see if it was ripe or rotten.</t1402> <t1403>The breath came closer.</t1403> <t1404>I smelled the scent of smoke, aftershave, and cigarette ash clinging to the hair.</t1404> <t1405>Then a voice, very soft, right near my head: it was him, his head buried in the curtain.</t1405>
<t1406>"I can help you," he said.</t1406> <t1407>Whispered.</t1407>
<t1408>“What?” I said.</t1408>
<t1409>"Shh," he said.</t1409> <t1410>"I can help you.</t1410> <t1411>I've helped many people already."</t1411>
<t1412>“Help me?” I said, my voice just as soft. “How could you?” What does he know, has he seen Luke, has he found him, can he bring him back?</t1412>
<t1413>“So what do you think?” he asked, still whispering barely audibly.</t1413> <t1414>Is his hand moving up my leg?</t1414> <t1415>He had taken off his glove.</t1415> <t1416>“The door is locked.</t1416> <t1417>No one will come in.</t1417> <t1418>No one will know it's not his.”</t1418>
<t1419>He drew back the curtain.</t1419> <t1420>The lower half of his face was covered by a white medical mask, adhering to the rules.</t1420> <t1421>Brown eyes, a nose, brown hair.</t1421> <t1422>A hand was lying between my legs.</t1422> <t1423>"Most of that bunch can't connect anymore," he said.</t1423> <t1424>"Or they are infertile."</t1424>
<t1425>I almost gasped: he just said a forbidden word.</t1425> <t1426>Infertile.</t1426> <t1427>These days, infertile men no longer exist, in theory.</t1427> <t1428>There are only fertile women and barren women, by law.</t1428>
<t1429>“A lot of women do that,” he continued.</t1429> <t1430>“You want to have a child, don't you?”</t1430>
<t1431>“Yes,” I said.</t1431> <t1432>That's right, and I didn't ask why, because I already knew.</t1432> <t1433>Give me a child, or I will die.</t1433> <t1434>That statement can be understood in more than one way.</t1434>
<t1435>“She’s ready now,” he said.</t1435> <t1436>“Perfect timing.</t1436> <t1437>Today or tomorrow will do, so why waste the opportunity?</t1437> <t1438>It will only take a few minutes, darling.”</t1438> <t1439>He probably used to call his wife that, back in the day; maybe he still does, but honestly, it’s just a generic term.</t1439> <t1440>We are all darlings.</t1440>
<t1441>I hesitated.</t1441> <t1442>He was offering himself to me, to serve me, and accepting the danger himself.</t1442>
<t1443>"I hate the scene they made you go through," he murmured.</t1443> <t1444>It was genuine, real sympathy; yet he was savoring this, sympathy or whatever it was.</t1444> <t1445>His eyes were wet with emotion, his hand moving over my body, tense and impatient.</t1445>
<t1446>"It's very dangerous," I said. "No.</t1446> <t1447>I can't do it." That's a death sentence.</t1447> <t1448>But you need to catch them in the act, with two witnesses.</t1448> <t1449>What's the probability, is the room bugged, is someone lurking by the door?</t1449>
<t1450>The hand paused.</t1450> <t1451>"Just think about it," he said.</t1451> <t1452>"I have seen your chart.</t1452> <t1453>You don't have much time left.</t1453> <t1454>But this is your life.</t1454><t1455>"</t1455>
<t1456>“Thank you,” I said.</t1456> <t1457>I had to give the impression that I wasn't outraged, that I was still willing to listen.</t1457> <t1458>He withdrew his hand, almost lethargically, deliberately lingering, as if this wasn't the final word according to his understanding.</t1458> <t1459>He could falsify the results, conclude that I had cancer, that I was infertile, and send me off to the Colonist zone, among the Unwomen.</t1459> <t1460>None of this was spoken aloud, but the awareness of that power hung in the air as he patted my inner thigh, retreating behind the drawn curtain.</t1460>
<t1461>“See you next month,” he said.</t1461>
<t1462>I put my clothes back on, behind the screen.</t1462> <t1463>My hands were trembling.</t1463> <t1464>Why am I so scared?</t1464> <t1465>I haven't crossed any boundaries, haven't placed any trust, haven't risked anything, everything is still safe.</t1465> <t1466>It's the fact that there is a choice that terrifies me.</t1466> <t1467>An escape, a salvation.</t1467>
<t1468>12</t1468>
<t1469>The bathroom is adjacent to the bedroom.</t1469> <t1470>The wallpaper is printed with small blue forget-me-not flowers, and the curtain color matches.</t1470> <t1471>The doormat is also blue, with a faux blue fur cover on the toilet seat; compared to the past, it only lacks a doll with a skirt covering the spare roll of toilet paper.</t1471> <t1472>Except for the mirror above the sink, which has been replaced by a long tin plate, and the door has no lock, and of course, there are no razors.</t1472> <t1473>Initially, there were a few incidents in the bathroom: slitting wrists, drowning.</t1473> <t1474>Before they managed to sort out all the issues.</t1474> <t1475>Cora sits on a chair in the hallway, making sure no one enters.</t1475> <t1476>In the bathroom, in the bathtub, the girls are easily attacked, Aunt Lydia says.</t1476> <t1477>She doesn't say by what.</t1477>
<t1478>Bath time is mandatory, but it is also a privilege.</t1478> <t1479>Just lifting off the heavy white wings with the veil, just feeling my hair again, in my hands, is already a privilege.</t1479> <t1480>My hair is now very long, uncut.</t1480> <t1481>Hair must be long but covered.</t1481> <t1482>Aunt Lydia said: Saint Paul decreed either that or shave it all off.</t1482> <t1483>She laughed, that characteristic suppressed snort, as if she had just told a very funny story.</t1483>
<t1484>Cora had filled the tub with water.</t1484> <t1485>Steam rose like a bowl of soup.</t1485> <t1486>I shed the remaining clothes, the outer robe, the short-sleeved shirt and the white slip, the red stockings, the cotton tights.</t1486> <t1487>Pantyhose make your crotch rot, Moira used to say. Aunt Lydia would never use the term crotch rot.</t1487> <t1488>To her, it was unsanitary.</t1488> <t1489>She wanted everything to be absolutely sanitary.</t1489>
<t1490>The bare body of my own self had managed to make me feel strange.</t1490> <t1491>My body seemed to have become outdated.</t1491> <t1492>Did I really once wear a swimsuit, on the beach?</t1492> <t1493>Indeed, without thinking, among men, without any concern that my legs, my arms, my thighs, and my back were exposed, visible to everyone.</t1493> <t1494>Unsightly, shameless.</t1494> <t1495>I avoided looking down at my body, not because it was unsightly and shameless, but because I did not want to see it.</t1495> <t1496>Not wanting to look at something that determined me so absolutely.</t1496>
<t1497>I stepped into the water, lay down, and let the water embrace me.</t1497> <t1498>The water was as soft as a human hand.</t1498> <t1499>I closed my eyes, and my child was there beside me, suddenly, without warning, probably because of the scent of soap.</t1499> <t1500>I pressed my face into the fine hair at the nape of the neck and inhaled the child's scent, the smell of baby powder and freshly bathed skin with shampoo, and faintly underneath, the smell of urine.</t1500> <t1501>The child is always that age when I enter the bathtub.</t1501> <t1502>The child returns at various ages.</t1502> <t1503>Because of this, I know the child is not a ghost.</t1503> <t1504>If it were a ghost, the child would always be the same age.</t1504>
<t1505>One day, when you were just eleven months old, right before you started walking, a woman kidnapped you from the supermarket shopping cart.</t1505> <t1506>It was a Saturday, which meant it was the day Luke and I went shopping together every week, since both of us worked all week long.</t1506> <t1507>You were sitting in the tiny child seat that shopping carts used to have back then, with a place to rest your feet.</t1507> <t1508>You were very excited, while I had my back turned, probably in the cat food aisle; Luke was at the other end of the store, out of sight, by the meat counter.</t1508> <t1509>He liked to pick out the meat for the week himself.</t1509> <t1510>He said men needed more meat than women, and it wasn't superstition, nor was he being silly, science had proven it. There were still some differences, he said.</t1510> <t1511>He liked to say that, as if I was trying to prove there weren't any.</t1511> <t1512>But he said that most often when my mother was around.</t1512> <t1513>He enjoyed teasing her.</t1513>
<t1514>I heard the child scream.</t1514> <t1515>I turned around and the child was disappearing at the end of the aisle, in the hands of a strange woman.</t1515> <t1516>I screamed, she was held back.</t1516> <t1517>She looked about thirty-five.</t1517> <t1518>She was crying, saying this was her child, God had given it to her, He had given her a sign.</t1518> <t1519>I felt sorry for her.</t1519> <t1520>The store owner apologized and they held her until the police arrived.</t1520>
<t1521>This woman is just crazy, Luke said.</t1521>
<t1522>I think it was an isolated incident, back then.</t1522>
<t1523>The child fades away, I can't hold on, the child is gone.</t1523> <t1524>Perhaps it's true that I also see the child as a ghost, the ghost of a little girl who died, a girl who died at the age of five.</t1524> <t1525>I remember the old photographs, I held the child, mother and baby, captured in a frame, to keep safe.</t1525> <t1526>With my eyes closed, I see myself now, sitting beside an open drawer, or a chest, in the basement, baby clothes folded and stored there, a lock of hair, cut when the child was two, placed in an envelope, platinum blonde.</t1526> <t1527>It darkened later.</t1527>
<t1528>I no longer have them, the clothes and the hairpiece.</t1528> <t1529>I wonder what happened to all my belongings.</t1529> <t1530>Stolen, thrown away, taken.</t1530> <t1531>Confiscated.</t1531>
<t1532>I have learned how to live without needing too many possessions.</t1532> <t1533>If you have many possessions, Aunt Lydia said, you will be bound to this material world and forget about spiritual values.</t1533> <t1534>You need to nurture a humble soul.</t1534> <t1535>Blessed are the meek.</t1535> <t1536>She did not say anything more about inheriting the promised land.</t1536>
<t1537>I lay there, water lapping over me, beside a non-existent open drawer, thinking about a little girl who never died when she was five; a little girl who still exists, I hope, though not because of me.</t1537> <t1538>Do I exist for her? Am I just a picture somewhere, in the dark recesses of her mind?</t1538>
<t1539>They must have told you that I was dead.</t1539> <t1540>That must be the way they would think of.</t1540> <t1541>They would say that to help you adapt more easily.</t1541>
<t1542>Eight years old, it must be that long.</t1542> <t1543>I have filled in the lost time, I know how long it has been.</t1543> <t1544>They said it would be easier if I considered the child dead.</t1544> <t1545>I wouldn't have to hope or make futile efforts.</t1545> <t1546>Aunt Lydia said, why bang your head against the wall?</t1546> <t1547>Sometimes she has a very figurative way of speaking.</t1547>
<t1548>"I don't have all day," Cora's voice came from behind the door.</t1548> <t1549>Yes, she doesn't have all day.</t1549> <t1550>She doesn't have anything completely.</t1550> <t1551>I must not take away her time.</t1551> <t1552>I lathered soap, took a brush and pumice stone to scrub off all the dead skin.</t1552> <t1553>There are such puritanical items like that.</t1553> <t1554>I want to be clean, sterile, germ-free, like the surface of the moon.</t1554> <t1555>I won't be able to scrub myself again, this afternoon, nor after that, for an entire day.</t1555> <t1556>Doing so might hinder, they say, what risk?</t1556>
<t1557>Now I can't avoid seeing it, the small tattoo on my ankle.</t1557> <t1558>Four digits, an eye, a reverse passport.</t1558> <t1559>To ensure that I will never disappear, permanently, into another land.</t1559> <t1560>I am too important, too rare, that must not be allowed to happen.</t1560> <t1561>I am a national resource.</t1561>
<t1562>I unplugged the drain, dried myself off, and put on a red bathrobe.</t1562> <t1563>The clothes I wore today will be left here; Cora will take them to be washed.</t1563> <t1564>Returning to my room, I dressed again from the beginning.</t1564> <t1565>The white hooded robe won't be needed tonight, as I won't be going anywhere.</t1565> <t1566>Everyone in this house has already seen my face.</t1566> <t1567>The red veil, however, still covered my wet hair, my head that hadn't been shaved.</t1567> <t1568>Where did I see that movie, the women kneeling in the city square, in the grip of hands, hair falling in clumps?</t1568> <t1569>What did they do? It must have been a long time ago, because I can't remember.</t1569>
<t1570>Cora brings me dinner, carefully covered, on a tray.</t1570> <t1571>She knocks before entering.</t1571> <t1572>I like her for that.</t1572> <t1573>It shows she thinks I still have a bit of what used to be called privacy.</t1573>
<t1574>“Thank you,” I said, taking the tray, and she actually smiled at me, but turned away without answering.</t1574> <t1575>When there were only two people left, she seemed shy around me.</t1575>
<t1576>I placed the tray on the white-painted table and pulled up a chair.</t1576> <t1577>I lifted the lid off.</t1577> <t1578>The chicken, overcooked, still better than being completely raw, she only had those two styles.</t1578> <t1579>Rita had countless ways to signal her coldness.</t1579> <t1580>Baked potatoes, green beans, salad.</t1580> <t1581>Canned pears for dessert.</t1581> <t1582>Nutritionally adequate, though bland.</t1582> <t1583>Good for health.</t1583> <t1584>You need enough vitamins and minerals, Aunt Lydia said shyly.</t1584> <t1585>Must make a worthy vessel.</t1585> <t1586>But no coffee or tea, or alcoholic beverages.</t1586> <t1587>Science has proven it.</t1587> <t1588>There was also a napkin, just like in a canteen.</t1588>
<t1589>I think about other people, those who are in need.</t1589> <t1590>This is the center, here, I am living in indulgence, may God grant us sincere gratitude, Aunt Lydia says, or maybe it’s thanksgiving, I don’t know, and I start eating.</t1590> <t1591>Tonight I am not hungry.</t1591> <t1592>My stomach is very uneasy.</t1592> <t1593>But I don't know where to discard the food, there are no potted plants, and I don't have the guts to try the toilet.</t1593> <t1594>I am just too tense, that's all.</t1594> <t1595>Could I leave it on the plate, hoping Cora won't tell?</t1595> <t1596>I chew and swallow, chew and swallow, feeling the sweat break out.</t1596> <t1597>In my stomach, the food clumps together, a wad of damp cardboard, tightly compressed.</t1597>
<t1598>Downstairs, in the dining room, there will be candles lit on the large table made of cherry wood, a white tablecloth, silver cutlery, flowers, and glasses filled with wine.</t1598> <t1599>You will hear the clinking of knives against porcelain, the clink when she puts down her fork, a barely noticeable sigh, leaving nearly half the plate untouched.</t1599> <t1600>She might say she has no appetite.</t1600> <t1601>She might not say anything.</t1601> <t1602>If she speaks, will he respond?</t1602> <t1603>If she doesn't speak, will he notice?</t1603> <t1604>I wonder how she still manages to make him notice her.</t1604> <t1605>It must be very difficult.</t1605>
<t1606>There is a spot of butter on the edge of the plate.</t1606> <t1607>I tore off a corner of the napkin, wrapped the butter, took it to the cupboard, and stuffed it deep into the right shoe, the spare pair, as I had done before.</t1607> <t1608>I crumpled the remaining piece of paper: obviously, no one would bother to smooth it out to see which piece was missing.</t1608> <t1609>I will use it later, when it is late.</t1609> <t1610>The smell of butter tonight will be of no use at all.</t1610>
<t1611>I wait.</t1611> <t1612>I prepare myself.</t1612> <t1613>Myself is now an object that needs preparation, like one prepares a speech.</t1613> <t1614>I need to present an artificial object, not a natural one.</t1614>
<t1615>V - A Nap</t1615>
<t1616>13</t1616>
<t1617>There is still leftover time.</t1617> <t1618>That is one of the things I was not prepared to deal with: the empty time, the wide parentheses enclosing nothing.</t1618> <t1619>Time makes white noise.</t1619> <t1620>If only I knew how to embroider.</t1620> <t1621>To weave, to knit, anything to keep my hands busy.</t1621> <t1622>I crave a cigarette.</t1622> <t1623>I remember walking through the exhibits, through the nineteenth century: back then people were obsessed with the harem theme.</t1623> <t1624>Dozens of harem paintings, plump women lounging in Turkish palaces, wearing military caps or velvet caps, fanning themselves with peacock feathers, with an eunuch standing menacingly in the background.</t1624> <t1625>Exercises in depicting lazy flesh, by those who had never been there.</t1625> <t1626>Those paintings were considered erotic, and I think they were, at that time; but now I truly understand what they were saying.</t1626> <t1627>They depicted interrupted activity; they depicted waiting, unused objects.</t1627> <t1628>They depicted boredom.</t1628>
<t1629>But perhaps boredom is enticing to men if it is the boredom of women.</t1629>
<t1630>I waited, having been bathed, groomed, and fed, like a prize-winning pig.</t1630> <t1631>Around the eighties, they came up with pig balls, meant for the friends who were getting fat in the pen.</t1631> <t1632>These were large, colorful balls for the pigs to push around with their snouts.</t1632> <t1633>The pig traders said this would increase muscle tension; the naturally curious pigs would be happy to have something to think about.</t1633>
<t1634>I read that in the introductory Psychology course; that, along with the chapter about the rats in the cage that self-administer electric shocks just to have something to do.</t1634> <t1635>And the chapter about the pigeons, trained to peck a button that would release a grain of corn.</t1635> <t1636>There were three groups: the first group always got it, the second group got it every other time, and the last group got it randomly.</t1636> <t1637>When the person in charge stopped giving corn, the first group gave up quite early, the second group took longer.</t1637> <t1638>The last group did not give up.</t1638> <t1639>They would rather peck until they died than stop.</t1639> <t1640>Who knows which is better?</t1640>
<t1641>I wish I had a pig ball.</t1641>
<t1642>I lay down on the braided mat.</t1642> <t1643>You can practice anytime, Aunt Lydia said.</t1643> <t1644>A few times a day, interspersed with other tasks.</t1644> <t1645>Hands on hips, knees bent, lift the hips, spine pressed down.</t1645> <t1646>Hug the knees and rock up.</t1646> <t1647>Repeat. Inhale counting to five, hold the breath, exhale.</t1647> <t1648>We practiced in what used to be the room</t1648>
<t1649>Housekeeping, the sewing machine and washer-dryer have been cleaned; simultaneously, lying on the narrow tatami mat, the cassette player is on, Les Sylphides.</t1649> <t1650>I can still hear it now, in my head, as I rise, bend, inhale, and exhale.</t1650> <t1651>Behind closed eyes, the slender white dancers swiftly glide among the trees, gracefully, their legs fluttering like the wings of birds caught in a trap.</t1651>
<t1652>In the afternoons, we would lie on our beds for about an hour in the gymnasium, from three to four o'clock.</t1652> <t1653>They said it was a time for meditative rest.</t1653> <t1654>Back then, I thought it was just because they themselves wanted a break from teaching, and I knew the nuns on duty would go to the staff room for a cup of coffee, or something they called coffee.</t1654> <t1655>But now I think even the rest period was a form of training.</t1655> <t1656>It gave us a chance to get used to having free time.</t1656>
<t1657>Nap time, Aunt Lydia called it, shyly as usual.</t1657>
<t1658>Strangely, we needed a break.</t1658> <t1659>Many people dozed off.</t1659> <t1660>There, we were very tired, almost always exhausted.</t1660> <t1661>We might have been given some kind of pill or liquid medicine, I guess, mixed into the food, to calm us down.</t1661> <t1662>It might not have been that.</t1662> <t1663>It could have been due to this very place.</t1663> <t1664>After the initial shock, after adapting, it was better to remain in a semi-conscious state.</t1664> <t1665>One could tell oneself that it was just conserving energy.</t1665>
<t1666>I must have been there for about three weeks when Moira arrived.</t1666> <t1667>She was brought into the gymnasium by two Aunts, as usual, while we were napping.</t1667> <t1668>She was still wearing her old clothes, jeans, a tight green t-shirt - her hair cut short, still defying fashion as always - so I recognized her immediately.</t1668> <t1669>She saw me too, but turned away, she had already understood what was safe.</t1669> <t1670>Her left cheek had a bruise, turning purple.</t1670> <t1671>The Aunts took her to a bed that already had a red dress laid out.</t1671> <t1672>She undressed, started changing, not saying a word, the Aunts stood at the foot of the bed, and we watched through slitted eyes. When she bent over, I could see the joints of her spine.</t1672>
<t1673>For several days I couldn't talk to her; we only exchanged glances, very quickly, in small sips.</t1673> <t1674>Friendship is suspicious, we knew, and we avoided each other when lining up for lunch in the canteen as well as in the hallway between classes.</t1674> <t1675>But on the fourth day, she lined up next to me during the walk, forming pairs parading around the football field.</t1675> <t1676>We hadn't received our white wings yet because we hadn't graduated, only the veil, so we could talk, as long as it was very quietly and without turning to look at each other.</t1676> <t1677>The aunts walked at the front and back of the line, so the only risk was the rest of the group.</t1677> <t1678>Some were very devout, they could report us.</t1678>
<t1679>It really is a crazy camp, Moira said.</t1679>
<t1680>Seeing you makes me so happy, I said.</t1680>
<t1681>Where can we talk? Moira said.</t1681>
<t1682>The restroom, I said.</t1682> <t1683>Remember to look at the clock.</t1683> <t1684>Last stall, two-thirty.</t1684>
<t1685>We just said that.</t1685>
<t1686>I feel safer, Moira is here.</t1686> <t1687>We are allowed to go to the restroom, just need to raise our hand, although there is a limit on the number of times we can go each day, and there is a chart to mark it.</t1687> <t1688>I keep track of the time, a round battery-operated clock, at the top of the class above the green blackboard.</t1688> <t1689>Two-thirty is exactly the middle of Fox hour.</t1689> <t1690>Aunt Helena is here, along with Aunt Lydia, because Fox hour is a special time.</t1690> <t1691>Aunt Helena is quite fat, she used to head the Weight Watchers branch in Iowa.</t1691> <t1692>When it comes to Fox hour, she is very proficient.</t1692>
<t1693>It's Janine again, telling the story of how she was gang-raped at fourteen and had to get an abortion.</t1693> <t1694>Last week she told the exact same story.</t1694> <t1695>She almost seemed proud while telling it.</t1695> <t1696>That story might not even be true.</t1696> <t1697>When it comes to Testimony time, it's safer to make something up than to say you have nothing to report.</t1697> <t1698>But with Janine, it could very well be at least somewhat true.</t1698>
<t1699>But whose fault is it? Aunt Helena asked, raising a chubby finger.</t1699>
<t1700>Because of her, because of her, because of her, we murmured in chorus.</t1700>
<t1701>Who encouraged them? Aunt Helena beamed, extremely pleased.</t1701>
<t1702>It's you. It's you. It's you.</t1702>
<t1703>Why would God allow such a terrible thing to happen?</t1703>
<t1704>To teach her a lesson.</t1704> <t1705>Teach her a lesson.</t1705> <t1706>Teach her a lesson.</t1706>
<t1707>Last week Janine burst into tears.</t1707> <t1708>Aunt Helena made her kneel at the front of the class, hands clasped behind her back, so we could all see clearly, her face flushed, snotty and tear-streaked.</t1708> <t1709>Her hair was a dull blonde, her eyelashes so sparse they were almost nonexistent, like someone who had just survived a fire.</t1709> <t1710>Her eyes had burned out.</t1710> <t1711>She looked disgusting: weak, writhing, filthy, with pinkish skin, like a newborn rat.</t1711> <t1712>None of us wanted to end up like that, not ever.</t1712> <t1713>For a moment, even knowing what she was going through, we felt contempt for her.</t1713>
<t1714>Crying over spoiled tea, crying over spoiled tea, crying over spoiled tea.</t1714>
<t1715>We really think so, that is the worst thing.</t1715>
<t1716>I used to think very highly of myself.</t1716> <t1717>Not at that time.</t1717>
<t1718>That was last week's story.</t1718> <t1719>This week, Janine didn't wait for us to mock her.</t1719> <t1720>It's because of you, she said.</t1720> <t1721>Because of you alone.</t1721> <t1722>You encouraged them.</t1722> <t1723>You deserve the pain.</t1723>
<t1724>Very good, Janine, Aunt Lydia said.</t1724> <t1725>You set a very good example.</t1725>
<t1726>I had to wait until the end of the play to raise my hand.</t1726> <t1727>Sometimes, if you ask at the wrong time, you will be refused.</t1727> <t1728>If there is indeed a need, the situation can turn out very badly.</t1728> <t1729>Yesterday, Dolores peed on the floor.</t1729> <t1730>Two aunts grabbed her by the armpits and dragged her outside.</t1730> <t1731>In the afternoon walk, she was not seen, but by night she was already in bed.</t1731> <t1732>All night, I heard her sobbing, going silent, and then bursting out again.</t1732>
<t1733>What did they do? we whispered between the beds.</t1733>
<t1734>I don't know.</t1734>
<t1735>Not knowing only makes it worse.</t1735>
<t1736>I raised my hand, Aunt Lydia nodded.</t1736> <t1737>I stood up and walked to the hall, trying my best to appear innocent.</t1737> <t1738>Outside the restroom, Aunt Elizabeth was standing guard.</t1738> <t1739>She nodded, signaling me to enter.</t1739>
<t1740>This used to be the men's restroom.</t1740> <t1741>The mirrors have all been replaced with dull gray diamond-shaped metal sheets, but the urinals are still there, on one wall, white porcelain with yellow stains.</t1741> <t1742>They look as bizarre as infant coffins.</t1742> <t1743>Once again, I am astonished at how men expose themselves so nakedly: the showerheads are not enclosed at all, bodies displayed for scrutinizing and comparing eyes, private parts openly shown.</t1743> <t1744>For what purpose?</t1744> <t1745>To reassure what exactly? Shiny badges, look everyone, everything in its place, I belong here.</t1745> <t1746>Why don't women have to prove to each other that they are indeed women?</t1746> <t1747>A way to unbutton, a split stance, just as unintentional.</t1747> <t1748>A dog's sniffing nose.</t1748>
<t1749>This school is old, the bathroom stalls have wooden partitions, a type of particle board.</t1749> <t1750>I went into the second stall from the inside, blocking the door.</t1750> <t1751>Of course, there is no longer a lock.</t1751> <t1752>On the wooden partition, there is a small hole, way in the back, near the wall, about waist-high, a relic from an old act of vandalism or the legacy of a peeping Tom from the past.</t1752> <t1753>The entire Center knows about this hole; except for the aunts.</t1753>
<t1754>I'm just afraid I'll be late, because of Janine's confession: what if Moira has already arrived, what if she had to turn back.</t1754> <t1755>They don't allow lingering in here.</t1755> <t1756>I cautiously look down, diagonally across the partition wall, on the other side are the red shoes.</t1756> <t1757>But how to know whose they are?</t1757>
<t1758>I pressed my mouth against the hole.</t1758> <t1759>Moira? I whispered.</t1759>
<t1760>Is that you? she replied.</t1760>
<t1761>Here I am, I said.</t1761> <t1762>My whole body felt light.</t1762>
<t1763>Oh God, I crave a cigarette so much, Moira said.</t1763>
<t1764>Me too, I replied.</t1764>
<t1765>I felt a bizarre kind of happiness.</t1765>
<t1766>I dive into my own body like into a swamp, a sinking ground, only I know where the bottom is.</t1766> <t1767>An uncertain surface, my own territory.</t1767> <t1768>I become the ground, pressing my ear to it, listening to guess the upcoming future.</t1768> <t1769>Every sharp pain, every dull ache, the layers of living matter peeling off, the tissues swelling then deflating, the flesh oozing, are all signs, things I need to grasp.</t1769> <t1770>Every month I watch the blood, in fear, because its arrival brings news of failure.</t1770> <t1771>Once again, I have failed the expectations of others, which have also become my own.</t1771>
<t1772>I used to consider my body as a tool, bringing pleasure, a vehicle for transportation, a means to achieve my desires.</t1772> <t1773>I could ride on it, press various buttons, and accomplish many things.</t1773> <t1774>There are limits, but still, my body is flexible, unified, solid, it is one with me.</t1774>
<t1775>Now the flesh restructures itself in a different way.</t1775> <t1776>I am a cloud, solidifying around the object at the center, pear-shaped, solid and more real than myself, glowing red inside the translucent shell.</t1776> <t1777>In its heart is a void, vast like the night sky and just as dark, round like that, though not exactly black but leaning towards black-red.</t1777> <t1778>Clusters of light swell up, twinkle, burst, and then shrink back inside it, thousands like stars.</t1778> <t1779>Each month a moon appears, gigantic, perfectly round, heavy, an omen.</t1779> <t1780>It passes by, pauses, then sets off again until it disappears from sight, and I feel despair rushing in like hunger.</t1780> <t1781>Must feel the emptiness, this time, this time again.</t1781> <t1782>I listen to my heart, waves rising upon waves, salty and red, patiently beating on, counting time.</t1782>
<t1783>I am in our first apartment, in the bedroom.</t1783> <t1784>Standing in front of the wardrobe, with foldable wooden doors.</t1784> <t1785>Everything around me is empty, all the furniture has been taken away, the floor is bare, not even a carpet; but the wardrobe is full of clothes.</t1785> <t1786>I think they are mine, but looking at them, they are not mine, I have never seen them before.</t1786> <t1787>They might belong to Luke's wife, whom I have never met; only seen pictures and heard her voice on the phone, late at night, when she called us, just before the divorce.</t1787> <t1788>But no, they are indeed my clothes.</t1788> <t1789>I need a shirt, I need something to wear.</t1789> <t1790>I pull out one outfit after another, black, blue, purple, tight tops, long skirts; none of them fit, not even one, they are all either too loose or too tight.</t1790>
<t1791>Luke was there, right behind me, I turned around to look.</t1791> <t1792>He wouldn't look at me, his eyes were downcast, the cat was rubbing against his legs, meowing plaintively.</t1792> <t1793>It was hungry, but what could I feed it when the apartment was so empty?</t1793>
<t1794>Luke, I called.</t1794> <t1795>He didn't answer.</t1795> <t1796>Maybe he didn't hear me.</t1796> <t1797>I suddenly thought maybe he was no longer alive.</t1797>
<t1798>I am running, with my child, holding their hand tightly, pulling, dragging through the ferns, their eyes half-open because I gave them medicine, so they wouldn't cry or say anything that would give us away, they don't even know where they are.</t1798> <t1799>The ground is uneven, with boulders, dry branches, the smell of damp earth, fallen leaves, they can't keep up, I could run faster alone, I'm good at running.</t1799> <t1800>Now they are crying again, they are scared, I want to carry them on my shoulders but they are too heavy.</t1800> <t1801>I'm wearing trail shoes and I think, when we reach the river I'll have to take them off, will it be cold, will they be able to swim that far, there's the current too, I didn't foresee this.</t1801> <t1802>Be quiet, I snap at them.</t1802> <t1803>I imagine them drowning and slow down.</t1803> <t1804>Then the gunshots follow, not loud, not booming like fireworks, but sharp and crisp like breaking dry branches.</t1804> <t1805>It doesn't sound normal, no sound is as people usually imagine, and I hear a voice, Get down, is it a real voice or just in my head, or am I shouting it myself?</t1805>
<t1806>I pulled the child down to the ground and lay on top of them to shield, to cover.</t1806> <t1807>Be quiet, I repeated, my face drenched, was it sweat or tears, I felt peaceful and buoyant, as if I had escaped my body; right near my eyes was a leaf, red in color, early to change, I could see each white vein.</t1807> <t1808>Never before had I seen anything so beautiful.</t1808> <t1809>I loosened up, afraid of suffocating the child, I changed position, curling up to embrace them, placing my hand over their mouth.</t1809> <t1810>There were the sounds of breathing and my heartbeat, pounding, like the sound of knocking on a door at night, when one thought they were in a safe place.</t1810> <t1811>It's okay, it's your mother, I whispered, Be good now, but how could it be? The child was too small, it was too late, we were separated, someone grabbed my hand, the outer edge was pitch black, nothing could be seen except for a small window, an incredibly small window, like looking through the wrong end of a telescope, like the window on an old Christmas card, outside was the freezing night, inside were candles, a glittering black tree, a family, I could even hear the bells, sleigh bells, on the radio, an old song, but this window only showed me, small but clear, I saw the child, moving away from me, among the leaves that had already changed color, yellow and red intermingled, small hands reaching towards me, being taken away.</t1811>
<t1812>The bell woke me up; then came Cora, knocking on the door.</t1812> <t1813>I sat up, on the carpet, wiping my face with my hand.</t1813> <t1814>No dream was ever as frightening as this one.</t1814>
<t1815>VI - Blessing</t1815>
<t1816>14</t1816>
<t1817>When the bell had stopped, I went down the stairs, momentarily drifting into oblivion through the glass eye on the wall of the lower floor.</t1817> <t1818>The clock chimed the hour with its pendulum, and the neat feet in red shoes counted the steps down the stairs.</t1818>
<t1819>The rest room door is wide open.</t1819> <t1820>I enter: so far, no one is here yet.</t1820> <t1821>I don't sit, but move into position, kneeling, close to the footstool where Serena Joy will soon place her feet, hand resting on the cane as she bends to sit down.</t1821> <t1822>She might even place her hand on my shoulder, for support, like a table or chair.</t1822> <t1823>It has happened once before.</t1823>
<t1824>The lounge in the past might have been called the reception room, for instance; then later, the living room.</t1824> <t1825>Or the guest hall, the kind meant for spiders and flies.</t1825> <t1826>But now it is officially called the lounge, because that's what people do in there, some people.</t1826> <t1827>Others only know what a serious room is.</t1827> <t1828>Individual posture holds great importance here and now: every small inconvenience is enlightening.</t1828>
<t1829>The room was somber and symmetrical; one of the forms of pre-frozen money.</t1829> <t1830>Money had seeped through this room for years, like flowing through underground caverns, depositing and hardening into various shapes like stalactites.</t1830> <t1831>The various surfaces silently displayed: the rosy velvet on the hanging curtains, the glossy paint of the matching armchair, eighteenth century, the plushness of the Chinese fur carpet on the floor, blooming pink peonies, the tender leather stretched over the arm of the Commander's chair, the glint of brass from the box beside it.</t1831>
<t1832>The carpet is genuine.</t1832> <t1833>In this room, some items are genuine, others are not, such as the two paintings, both depicting women, each on one side of the fireplace.</t1833> <t1834>Both are dressed in black, as in an old church, although from a later period.</t1834> <t1835>The two paintings might be genuine.</t1835> <t1836>I suspect that when they were brought in, after realizing that she would have to limit her enthusiasm to purely domestic matters, Serena Joy intended to leave behind a family heirloom.</t1836> <t1837>It's also possible that they were already there when the Commander acquired the house.</t1837> <t1838>There's no way to know these things.</t1838> <t1839>In any case, they still hang there, mouths stiff, chests tightly bound, faces wrinkled, starched caps rigid, pale white skin, their narrowed eyes watching over the room.</t1839>
<t1840>Between them, on the hearth, was an oval mirror, flanked by two pairs of silver candlesticks, with a white porcelain Cupid in the center, its arms around the neck of a lamb.</t1840> <t1841>Serena Joy's taste was a strange mixture: reaching the heights of quality and descending to the depths of sentimentality.</t1841> <t1842>There were two plates of dried flowers on either side of the fireplace, and a vase of fresh yellow daffodils on a small polished wooden table next to the sofa.</t1842>
<t1843>The room smelled of lemon oil, canvas, half-wilted flowers, lingering kitchen odors wafting from the kitchen or dining room, and Serena Joy's perfume: Lily of the Valley.</t1843> <t1844>Perfume is a luxury item; she must have her own private source.</t1844> <t1845>I inhaled, thinking I should appreciate it more.</t1845> <t1846>It was the scent of a prepubescent girl, the kind of gifts children often buy for Mother's Day; the smell of white cotton socks and white cotton slips, baby powder, the skin of a young girl not yet given way to hair and blood. That scent made me feel slightly uneasy, like being in a closed car on a hot day with a woman wearing too much makeup.</t1846> <t1847>That's what the sitting room was like, despite its elegance.</t1847>
<t1848>I really want to steal something in this room.</t1848> <t1849>I want to take something small, like the carved ashtray, the small silver snuffbox on the mantelpiece, or a dried flower: hide it in the fold of my coat or sleeve pocket, until the end of the evening, then store it in my room, under the mattress, in my shoe, or in the crevice of the hard pillow embroidered with the word FAITH. From time to time, I will take it out to admire.</t1849> <t1850>It will give me a sense of power.</t1850>
<t1851>But that feeling, if it exists, is just an illusion, and reckless too.</t1851> <t1852>My hands stay where they are, folded in my lap.</t1852> <t1853>Thighs closed, heels tucked underneath, pressing into my body.</t1853> <t1854>Head bowed low.</t1854> <t1855>Mouth tasting of toothpaste: fake mint and plaster.</t1855>
<t1856>I sit, waiting for the family to be complete. Family: that's how we are.</t1856> <t1857>The leader stands at the head of the family.</t1857> <t1858>The family is protected by him.</t1858> <t1859>Enjoyment and protection, only death can separate them.</t1859>
<t1860>About a boat.</t1860> <t1861>An empty space.</t1861>
<t1862>Cora came in first, followed by Rita, wiping her hands.</t1862> <t1863>They too were summoned by the bell, they hated it, they had so many other things to do, like dishes.</t1863> <t1864>But they needed to be here, everyone needed to be here, the Ceremony demanded it.</t1864> <t1865>We were all required to sit through it, however we managed.</t1865>
<t1866>Rita glared at me before slipping behind my back.</t1866> <t1867>It's my fault that she has to waste her time like this.</t1867> <t1868>It's not my fault, it's my body's fault, if that makes any difference.</t1868> <t1869>Even the Commander is subject to its whims.</t1869>
<t1870>Nick walked in, nodded to greet all three, and looked around the room.</t1870> <t1871>He also came to stand behind me.</t1871> <t1872>So close that the tip of his boot touched my foot, was it intentional?</t1872> <t1873>Anyway, we were touching, two leather-clad figures.</t1873> <t1874>I felt my shoe soften, blood flowed into it, it warmed up, becoming living skin.</t1874> <t1875>I gently moved my foot away from there.</t1875>
<t1876>"Please hurry up," Cora said.</t1876>
<t1877>"Hurry up, still waiting," Nick said.</t1877> <t1878>He laughed loudly, shifting his foot to touch me again.</t1878> <t1879>No one saw, the folds of the dress spread wide.</t1879> <t1880>I moved, it was too warm in here, the smell of perfume made me want to vomit.</t1880> <t1881>I shifted my foot away.</t1881>
<t1882>We hear Serena coming, down the stairs, along the hallway, the sound of her cane thumping on the carpet, the heavy step of her good leg.</t1882> <t1883>She limps into the doorway, glances at us, counting but not seeing.</t1883> <t1884>She nods slightly, to Nick, but says nothing.</t1884> <t1885>She is wearing her best dress, sky blue, with white embroidery along the edges: flowers and geometric shapes.</t1885> <t1886>At her age, she still feels the need to cover herself with flowers.</t1886> <t1887>It's no use, I think to her, my face unchanged, you can't use them anymore, you're withered.</t1887> <t1888>Flowers are the reproductive organs of plants.</t1888> <t1889>I read that somewhere, once.</t1889>
<t1890>She made her way to the chair and the stool, turned around, crouched down, and touched the ground very ungracefully.</t1890> <t1891>She lifted her left leg onto the stool and fumbled in her sleeve pocket.</t1891> <t1892>I heard the rustling sound, the click of a lighter, smelled the warm, slightly acrid smoke, and took a deep breath.</t1892>
<t1893>“Late as always,” she said.</t1893> <t1894>We did not reply.</t1894> <t1895>We heard the clattering as she fumbled to turn on the table lamp, then a click, and the TV came on.</t1895>
<t1896>The male choir, half yellow half green skin - the color not quite right; singing "Come to the chapel by the wild forest".</t1896> <t1897>Come, come, come, come, the bass drops.</t1897> <t1898>Serena changes the channel.</t1898> <t1899>The image is noisy, full of color bands, the sound distorted: the Montreal satellite station is blocked.</t1899> <t1900>Then a priest appears, with a sincere demeanor, bright black eyes, standing behind a table leaning towards us.</t1900> <t1901>Now they look not much different from businessmen.</t1901> <t1902>Serena allows him to speak for a few seconds, then switches again.</t1902>
<t1903>After a few blank channels, the news came on.</t1903> <t1904>It's what she was looking for.</t1904> <t1905>She leaned back, taking a deep drag on her cigarette.</t1905> <t1906>In contrast, I leaned forward, the child allowed to stay up late with the adults.</t1906> <t1907>This was the only thing that mattered on these evenings, these Festival month evenings: I was allowed to watch the news.</t1907> <t1908>It had almost become an unspoken rule in the household: we always arrived on time, he was always late, Serena always let us watch the news.</t1908>
<t1909>That's all I know: who knows if there's anything trustworthy?</t1909>
<t1910>The footage could have been pre-recorded, it could be fake.</t1910> <t1911>But I still watch, hoping to read between the lines.</t1911> <t1912>Now, any news is better than no news.</t1912>
<t1913>First of all, there is the front line.</t1913> <t1914>In reality, it is not exactly a "front": the fighting seems to be happening simultaneously in many places.</t1914>
<t1915>The hilltop has trees, from the sky looking down, the leaves are sickly yellow.</t1915> <t1916>I asked her to adjust the colors.</t1916> <t1917>On the Appalachian highlands, the narrator said, the Apocalypse Angel Corps, 4th Division, is smoking out a handful of Purification guerrillas, with air support from the 21st Battalion of the Light Angel Corps.</t1917> <t1918>We watched two helicopters, black with silver wings painted on the sides.</t1918> <t1919>Below, a patch of trees exploded.</t1919>
<t1920>Close-up of a prisoner, face dirty and stubbled with beard, flanked by two Angels in crisp black uniforms.</t1920> <t1921>The prisoner receives a cigarette from one of the Angels, awkwardly placing it to his lips with his bound hands.</t1921> <t1922>He slightly smirks.</t1922> <t1923>The spokesperson is saying something, but I don't hear: I look into the other man's eyes, guessing what he is thinking.</t1923> <t1924>He knows there is a camera: is that smile provocative, or submissive?</t1924> <t1925>Now captured, is he ashamed or not?</t1925>
<t1926>They only show victories, never failures.</t1926> <t1927>Who wants to hear bad news anyway?</t1927>
<t1928>It could just be an actor.</t1928>
<t1929>Now we see the spokesperson's face.</t1929> <t1930>His demeanor is extremely gentle and soothing; he looks at us from the screen, tanned skin, silver hair, steadfast eyes, wise wrinkles, the ideal image of a grandfather.</t1930> <t1931>He tells us these things, that unwavering smile says, it's all just for our own good, everything will be fine soon.</t1931> <t1932>I promise.</t1932> <t1933>There will be peace.</t1933> <t1934>You must believe it. Go to sleep, like all good children.</t1934>
<t1935>He said the things we wanted to believe.</t1935> <t1936>He was very persuasive.</t1936>
<t1937>I struggled to resist him.</t1937> <t1938>Just an end-of-season movie star, I told myself, with false teeth and empty talk.</t1938> <t1939>At the same time, I wavered towards him, as if hypnotized.</t1939> <t1940>If only it were real.</t1940> <t1941>If only I could believe it.</t1941>
<t1942>Now he is talking about the underground spy ring that was smashed by a group called The Eye, thanks to an internal informant.</t1942> <t1943>This organization was smuggling precious national resources across the border to Canada.</t1943>
<t1944>“Five followers of the Quaker heretical sect have been arrested,” he said with a faint smile, “and more arrests are expected.”</t1944>
<t1945>Two Quakers appeared on the screen, a man and a woman.</t1945> <t1946>They looked terrified, but still tried to maintain their dignity in front of the camera.</t1946> <t1947>The man had a large bruise on his forehead; the woman had her clothes torn, her hair hanging in strands around her face.</t1947> <t1948>Both were around fifty years old.</t1948>
<t1949>Now we see a city, again from a high vantage point looking down.</t1949> <t1950>It used to be Detroit.</t1950> <t1951>In the background of the narration is the sound of artillery fire.</t1951> <t1952>Columns of smoke rise along the horizon.</t1952>
<t1953>“The resettlement effort for the Ham lineage is still on schedule,” the reassuringly rosy face appeared again.</t1953> <t1954>“This week, three thousand people have arrived at National Settlement 1, with another two thousand on the way.” How did they manage to transport so many people at once?</t1954> <t1955>By train or by car?</t1955> <t1956>We didn’t get to see any images at all.</t1956> <t1957>National Settlement 1 is located in North Dakota.</t1957> <t1958>God knows what they intend for them to do when they get there.</t1958> <t1959>Farming, that’s the rumor.</t1959>
<t1960>Serena Joy had heard enough.</t1960> <t1961>Impatient, she changed the channel, encountering an aging singer with a baritone voice and sagging cheeks like a cow's udder. "Gentle Hope" was the song he was singing.</t1961> <t1962>Serena turned him off.</t1962>
<t1963>We waited, the clock struck the hour in the hall, Serena lit another cigarette, I got into the car.</t1963> <t1964>This morning is Saturday, September, we still have a car.</t1964> <t1965>The others have had to sell everything.</t1965> <t1966>My name is not Offred, I have another name, now no one calls it because it is forbidden.</t1966> <t1967>I tell myself it doesn't matter, a name is like a phone number, just for others to use; but what I tell myself is not true, it does matter.</t1967> <t1968>I keep the awareness of this name like a stored object, a treasure I will come back to dig up, later.</t1968> <t1969>I consider that name buried.</t1969> <t1970>The name lies within a surrounding aura, like a protective talisman, a spell that has resisted life from a long-lost time.</t1970> <t1971>Every night I lie on my single bed, eyes closed, and the name hovers behind my eyelids, not quite within reach, glowing in the dark.</t1971>
<t1972>This Saturday morning in September, I still carry my radiant name.</t1972> <t1973>The little girl who is now dead is sitting behind, carrying her two most beloved dolls, along with the stuffed rabbit, worn out from age and kisses.</t1973> <t1974>I remember every detail clearly.</t1974> <t1975>These details are extremely sentimental, but I can't help it.</t1975> <t1976>But I can't think too much about the rabbit, can't cry right now, on the Chinese carpet, while inhaling the stale smoke from Serena's breath.</t1976> <t1977>Not now, not here, save it for another time.</t1977>
<t1978>I thought the whole family was going on a picnic, and indeed there was a basket of food in the back, next to me, proper food, boiled eggs, a thermos, and all sorts of other things.</t1978> <t1979>We didn't want you to know where we were actually going, didn't want you to accidentally say something, to reveal anything, in case we were stopped.</t1979> <t1980>We didn't want to place the burden of the truth on you.</t1980>
<t1981>I put on my running shoes, my child has sports shoes.</t1981> <t1982>The shoelaces of my child's shoes are decorated with hearts, red, pink, yellow, and purple.</t1982> <t1983>Compared to this month, the weather is quite warm, the leaves are starting to change color, on a few scattered trees; Luke is driving, I sit beside him, the sun is shining, the sky is blue, the houses along the road look cozy and very ordinary, each house left behind disappears into the past, collapsing in an instant as if they never existed, because I will never see them again; or at least I was convinced of that.</t1983>
<t1984>We hardly brought anything with us, not wanting to give the impression that we were going on a long or distant trip.</t1984> <t1985>We carried fake passports, very reliable, worth the money.</t1985> <t1986>Of course, we didn't pay with money, nor did we count it as a computer expense: we used another method, a few pieces of jewelry my grandmother left behind, and a stamp collection Luke inherited from his uncle.</t1986> <t1987>Those items could be exchanged for money abroad.</t1987> <t1988>When we reached the border, we would pretend to be on a day trip; the fake visa stamps were only effective for a day.</t1988> <t1989>Before that, I would give my child sleeping pills so they would sleep while crossing the border.</t1989> <t1990>That way, the child wouldn't give us away.</t1990> <t1991>You can't expect children to lie smoothly.</t1991> <t1992>And I didn't want my child to be terrified, didn't want them to feel the horror tightening every muscle, straightening my spine, making me so tense that I feared I would shatter if anyone touched me.</t1992> <t1993>Each stop was a trial by fire.</t1993> <t1994>We would sleep at a motel, or better yet, in the car, on a side road to avoid suspicious questions.</t1994> <t1995>We would cross the border in the morning, over the bridge, very simple, just like driving to the supermarket.</t1995>
<t1996>The car turned onto the highway, heading north, the road was deserted, moving smoothly.</t1996> <t1997>Since the onset of the war, gas prices have surged, and it has also become scarce.</t1997> <t1998>Leaving the city meant passing through the first checkpoint.</t1998> <t1999>They only asked to see the driver's license, Luke managed it fine.</t1999> <t2000>The driver's license and passport matched: that was accounted for.</t2000>
<t2001>When we set off again, he squeezed my hand tightly and looked at me.</t2001> <t2002>You are as pale as a sheet of paper, he said.</t2002>
<t2003>And I felt exactly like that: white, flat, paper-thin.</t2003> <t2004>I felt transparent.</t2004> <t2005>Surely they would see right through to my heart and liver.</t2005> <t2006>Worse, how could I hold on to Luke, to the child, if I was this flat, this white?</t2006> <t2007>I felt like there was hardly anything left of me; the two of them would slip out of my arms, as if I were made of smoke, a desert mirage, gradually fading before their eyes.</t2007> <t2008>Don't think like that, Moira would surely say.</t2008> <t2009>Thinking like that will make it happen.</t2009>
<t2010>Smile, Luke said.</t2010> <t2011>Now you're going a bit fast.</t2011> <t2012>The blood has rushed to your head.</t2012> <t2013>Now you're even singing.</t2013> <t2014>Life is still beautiful, you hum.</t2014>
<t2015>Even that matter worries me.</t2015> <t2016>People have warned not to show too much joy.</t2016>
<t2017>15</t2017>
<t2018>The Commander knocked on the door.</t2018> <t2019>That was the rule: the sitting room was considered Serena Joy's territory, and he had to ask permission to enter.</t2019> <t2020>She liked to make him wait.</t2020> <t2021>A small matter, but in this household, every small matter had significance.</t2021> <t2022>However, tonight, she did not even have that pleasure, because before she could say anything, he had already stepped into the room.</t2022> <t2023>It could simply be that he forgot the convention, or it could be deliberate.</t2023> <t2024>Who knows what she had said to him at the glittering silver dinner table? Or perhaps said nothing at all.</t2024>
<t2025>The commander wore a black uniform, looking like a museum guard.</t2025> <t2026>Half-retired, courteous but suspicious, sitting idle all day.</t2026> <t2027>But that's just at first glance.</t2027> <t2028>Upon closer inspection, he resembled a Midwestern banker, with neatly combed silver hair, a dignified demeanor, and slightly hunched shoulders.</t2028> <t2029>Look even closer and you'll see his mustache is also silver, and then there's the chin, which no one could overlook.</t2029> <t2030>Down to the chin, he looked like a vodka advertisement from a glossy magazine, from a bygone era.</t2030>
<t2031>He had a gentle demeanor, large hands, thick fingers, a greedy thumb, blue eyes that were completely closed off, deceptively harmless.</t2031> <t2032>He looked at us as if taking inventory.</t2032> <t2033>A woman in red knelt, a woman in blue sat, two in green stood, and a single man, with a bony face, formed the background.</t2033> <t2034>He skillfully feigned confusion, as if he couldn't quite remember why all these women were here.</t2034> <t2035>Like things that had just been picked up by chance, a Victorian foot-pedal piano, he hadn't figured out what to do with us.</t2035> <t2036>Or how much we were worth.</t2036>
<t2037>He nodded vaguely in the direction of Serena Joy, who did not open her mouth.</t2037> <t2038>He walked across the room to the large leather armchair reserved for him, took a key from his pocket, and fumbled with the intricately brass-bound leather box placed on the side table next to the chair.</t2038> <t2039>He inserted the key, opened the box, and took out a Bible, a regular edition, black cover, gold-edged pages.</t2039> <t2040>The Bible was securely locked, like how tea used to be locked up in the past, so that the servants couldn't steal it.</t2040> <t2041>A firebomb: who knows what we would do with it, if we could get our hands on it?</t2041> <t2042>We are read to, thanks to him, but we are not allowed to read.</t2042> <t2043>All heads turned towards him, expectant, the story-telling time had come.</t2043>
<t2044>The commander sat down cross-legged, under the gaze of ten eyes.</t2044> <t2045>The bookmarks were all in place.</t2045> <t2046>He opened the scripture.</t2046> <t2047>He cleared his throat slightly, seemingly embarrassed.</t2047>
<t2048>“Give me a glass of water,” he said absentmindedly.</t2048> <t2049>“Is that okay?” he added.</t2049>
<t2050>Behind me, one of the two, Cora or Rita, left the scene and waddled towards the kitchen.</t2050> <t2051>The Commander sat there, eyes on the floor.</t2051> <t2052>The Commander sighed, pulled a pair of gold-rimmed glasses from his inner pocket, and pushed them up his nose.</t2052> <t2053>Now he looked like the old shoemaker from a fairy tale.</t2053> <t2054>Did he have an endless reserve of masks, those of human prisoners?</t2054>
<t2055>We monitored: every centimeter, every startle.</t2055>
<t2056>Being a man, among a group of women watching.</t2056> <t2057>It must be very strange.</t2057> <t2058>When you let them, attentively watching you, at all times.</t2058> <t2059>When you let them guess, What will you do next?</t2059> <t2060>Making them flinch at every movement, no matter how harmless, like reaching for an ashtray.</t2060> <t2061>Letting them measure you.</t2061> <t2062>Letting them think to themselves, No, no way, it has to be this way, the third sentence as if you were some kind of outfit, shabby or second-rate, still having to wear it because otherwise there's nothing else.</t2062>
<t2063>To let them bring him in, fit him, test him, while he also brings them in, like putting a sock on a foot, wrapping around his stubby tail, the very sensitive extra thumb, the tentacle, the weak stalked eye of a naked snail, knowing how to extend, expand, retract, or curl back inside if touched the wrong way, then enlarge, slightly swell at the tip, move forward as if along a leaf stalk, into them, eager to see.</t2063> <t2064>To see in that way, through a journey into the darkness, the kind of darkness formed by a woman, by a woman who knows how to see in the dark while he here strains forward in blindness.</t2064>
<t2065>That person is watching him from the inside.</t2065> <t2066>We are all watching him.</t2066> <t2067>The only thing we are truly allowed to do, which is not meaningless: if he hesitates, loses, if he dies, what will become of us?</t2067> <t2068>No wonder he is like a boot, with a hard exterior, encasing white feet.</t2068> <t2069>But this is just a wish.</t2069> <t2070>I have observed him for quite a while and have not seen any signs of weakness.</t2070>
<t2071>But beware, Commander, I whispered in my head.</t2071> <t2072>I still keep an eye on you.</t2072> <t2073>A slight move and I'm dead.</t2073>
<t2074>Anyway, it must be really miserable to be a man like that.</t2074>
<t2075>It should be fine.</t2075>
<t2076>It must be really miserable.</t2076>
<t2077>It must be extremely lonely.</t2077>
<t2078>The water arrived, the Commander drank.</t2078> <t2079>"Thank you," he said.</t2079> <t2080>Cora shuffled back to her place.</t2080>
<t2081>The commander paused, looked down, and scrutinized the page.</t2081> <t2082>Very leisurely, as if he didn't remember our presence.</t2082> <t2083>Like a diner poking at a steak, behind the restaurant's glass, pretending not to see the hungry eyes watching from the darkness less than a meter away.</t2083> <t2084>We leaned slightly towards him, like iron filings drawn to a magnet.</t2084> <t2085>If he tested us, he would find us lacking, he would have words.</t2085> <t2086>But in the past, we squandered so much.</t2086>
<t2087>The commander, seemingly reluctant, opened his mouth and read aloud.</t2087> <t2088>The reading wasn't very good.</t2088> <t2089>It might have been just out of boredom.</t2089>
<t2090>It's still the same old story, still the same old stories. God told Adam, God told Noah. Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.</t2090> <t2091>Then came Rachel and Leah with the musty smell we were stuffed with at the Center.</t2091> <t2092>Give me children, or else I die.</t2092> <t2093>Am I in the place of God, who has withheld children from you?</t2093> <t2094>Here is my maid Bilhah.</t2094> <t2095>She shall bear a child on my knees, so that I too may have children through her.</t2095> <t2096>And so on and so forth.</t2096> <t2097>We heard it along with breakfast, sitting in the high school cafeteria, eating oatmeal with cream and brown sugar.</t2097> <t2098>You are getting the best, you know, Aunt Lydia said.</t2098> <t2099>It's wartime, and all essentials are rationed.</t2099> <t2100>You girls are spoiled, she blinked, as if scolding a child.</t2100> <t2101>You naughty little thing.</t2101>
<t2102>As for lunch, there are Eight Beatitudes.</t2102> <t2103>Blessed are this, blessed are that.</t2103> <t2104>Play the tape recording, so that even the nuns do not commit the sin of reading.</t2104> <t2105>A man's voice.</t2105> <t2106>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</t2106> <t2107>Blessed are the merciful.</t2107> <t2108>Blessed are the meek.</t2108> <t2109>Blessed are those who keep their mouths shut.</t2109> <t2110>I know they made this up, I know it's wrong, and they also cut out a lot, but there's no way to verify.</t2110> <t2111>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</t2111>
<t2112>No one knows when.</t2112>
<t2113>I kept an eye on the clock, during dessert, a pear with cinnamon, the standard lunch, and glanced around to find Moira two tables away.</t2113> <t2114>She was already gone.</t2114> <t2115>I raised my hand, with permission.</t2115> <t2116>We didn't go too often, and the timing always changed.</t2116>
<t2117>When I went to the restroom, I entered the second stall from the inside, as usual.</t2117>
<t2118>Do you have it? I whispered.</t2118>
<t2119>Present, although the face is quite a mess, Moira whispered in response.</t2119>
<t2120>What did you hear? I asked.</t2120>
<t2121>Not much.</t2121> <t2122>I have to get out of here, I'm going crazy.</t2122> <t2123>I'm terrified.</t2123> <t2124>No, Moira, I said, don't risk it.</t2124> <t2125>You can't do it alone.</t2125>
<t2126>I'll pretend to be sick.</t2126> <t2127>There will be an ambulance, I saw it already.</t2127>
<t2128>You can only get to the hospital and that's it.</t2128> <t2129>At least it's a change of scenery.</t2129> <t2130>I don't have to listen to that nagging woman anymore.</t2130>
<t2131>They will find out.</t2131>
<t2132>Don't worry, I'm really good at this.</t2132> <t2133>Back in high school, I stopped taking vitamin C and got scurvy immediately.</t2133> <t2134>At first, they couldn't diagnose it right away.</t2134> <t2135>Then I started taking it again and everything was fine.</t2135> <t2136>I'll hide all the vitamin C pills.</t2136>
<t2137>Moira, please.</t2137>
<t2138>I can't bear it if you're no longer here, with me.</t2138> <t2139>Because of me.</t2139>
<t2140>There will be two guys going along, in that ambulance.</t2140> <t2141>Think about it.</t2141> <t2142>They must have been dying of hunger for a long time, damn it, they're not even allowed to put their hands in their pockets, the opportunity is quite...</t2142>
<t2143>The women inside.</t2143> <t2144>Time's up.</t2144> <t2145>Aunt Elizabeth's voice, outside the door.</t2145> <t2146>I stand up, flush the toilet.</t2146> <t2147>Moira's two fingers appear, through the wall hole.</t2147> <t2148>Just enough space for two fingers.</t2148> <t2149>I touch them with my hand, quickly, grasping.</t2149> <t2150>Let go.</t2150>
<t2151>“Mrs. Leah said, God has rewarded me because I gave my maidservant to my husband,” the Commander said.</t2151> <t2152>He let the folded book fall.</t2152> <t2153>It exhaled a dull sound, like a door closing by itself somewhere far away: a burst of air escaping.</t2153> <t2154>The sound was enough to imagine the softness of the pages, thin as silk, to imagine the feeling when touching them with a fingertip.</t2154> <t2155>Soft and dry, like blotting paper, pinkish and smooth, from ancient times, sold in thin stacks to dab sweat off the nose, in stores that also sold candles and soaps of various shapes: mushroom-shaped, shell-shaped.</t2155> <t2156>Like cigarette paper. Like flower petals.</t2156>
<t2157>The commander sat with his eyes closed for a long time, looking tired.</t2157> <t2158>He had been busy all day long.</t2158> <t2159>He bore many responsibilities.</t2159>
<t2160>Serena had been crying for a while.</t2160> <t2161>I heard it, behind me.</t2161> <t2162>Not the first time.</t2162> <t2163>It's always like this, every Festival night.</t2163> <t2164>She didn't make a sound.</t2164> <t2165>She kept her dignity, in front of us.</t2165> <t2166>The mattress and carpet muffled her sounds, but we could still hear them clearly.</t2166> <t2167>She couldn't control it, but she still strained to suppress it, the tension was truly terrifying.</t2167> <t2168>It was like farting in the middle of a church.</t2168> <t2169>Again, like every time, I wanted to burst out laughing, but not because I found it funny.</t2169> <t2170>Her crying filled the room with a stench and we pretended not to notice.</t2170>
<t2171>The commander opened his eyes, noticed, frowned, and stopped noticing.</t2171> <t2172>"Now is the moment of silent prayer," he said.</t2172> <t2173>"We will ask for blessings and success in all our endeavors."</t2173>
<t2174>I bowed my head, closed my eyes.</t2174> <t2175>I listened to the restrained breath, the almost inaudible gasps, the trembling still continuing behind me.</t2175> <t2176>She must hate me a lot, I thought.</t2176>
<t2177>I silently prayed: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t2177> <t2178>I don't understand what it means, but it sounds reasonable when spoken, and I have no other choice, because I don't know what else to say to God.</t2178> <t2179>Not at this moment.</t2179> <t2180>Not, as they used to say, at this very moment.</t2180> <t2181>The words etched on the closet floor flicker before my eyes, remnants of a strange woman, bearing Moira's face.</t2181> <t2182>I saw her, being taken to the ambulance, on a stretcher, carried by two Angels.</t2182>
<t2183>What's going on? I mouthed to the woman next to me; harmless, such a question, unless it hits a fanatic, that's all.</t2183>
<t2184>High fever, those lips responded.</t2184> <t2185>Appendicitis, that's what they said.</t2185>
<t2186>I was eating, that evening, minced meat with thinly sliced potatoes.</t2186><t2187>I was sitting right by the window, able to look out into the yard, all the way to the front gate.</t2187><t2188>I saw the ambulance return, this time without the siren.</t2188><t2189>An Angel jumped out, said a few words to the guard.</t2189><t2190>The guard went inside; the vehicle remained there; the Angel stood with his back to us, as trained.</t2190><t2191>Two Aunts came out of the building, along with the guard.</t2191><t2192>They walked around to the back of the vehicle.</t2192><t2193>They pulled Moira out, dragged her through the gate, up the front steps, each holding her by an arm.</t2193><t2194>She walked with great difficulty.</t2194><t2195>I stopped eating, I couldn't eat; now everyone at my table was staring out the window.</t2195><t2196>The window was made of dull green glass, with a wire mesh embedded inside.</t2196><t2197>Aunt Lydia said, better eat up.</t2197><t2198>She came closer and pulled the shade down.</t2198>
<t2199>They brought her into the room that used to be the laboratory.</t2199> <t2200>It was also the room that none of us had ever voluntarily entered.</t2200> <t2201>After that, she couldn't walk for a whole week, her feet no longer fit into her shoes, they swelled up.</t2201> <t2202>They will do the feet first, for the first offense.</t2202> <t2203>Using a steel cable whip, with jagged ends.</t2203> <t2204>Then they move on to the hands.</t2204> <t2205>No matter what they do to our hands and feet, it doesn't matter, even if it's permanent injury.</t2205> <t2206>Remember this well, Aunt Lydia said.</t2206> <t2207>For our purposes, your hands and feet are not necessary.</t2207>
<t2208>Moira lay on the bed, setting an example for everyone.</t2208> <t2209>She shouldn't have tried, especially with the Angels, Alma said from the next bed.</t2209> <t2210>We had to carry her to class.</t2210> <t2211>We stole small packets of sugar for her, every meal in the cafeteria, secretly passing them to her, every night, across the beds.</t2211> <t2212>Of course, she didn't need the sugar, but it was the only thing we could manage to steal.</t2212> <t2213>To give away.</t2213>
<t2214>I am still praying, but all I see before me are Moira's legs, after they brought her back.</t2214> <t2215>Her legs do not look like human legs.</t2215> <t2216>They look like the legs of a drowned corpse, swollen, limp, except for the color.</t2216> <t2217>The color is like that of lungs.</t2217>
<t2218>Oh Lord, I pray.</t2218> <t2219>Don't let the bastards grind you down.</t2219>
<t2220>Is this truly your intention?</t2220>
<t2221>The commander cleared his throat.</t2221> <t2222>It meant that according to him, we could start praying. "For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to Him," he said.</t2222>
<t2223>Signal to stop.</t2223> <t2224>He stood up.</t2224> <t2225>We dispersed.</t2225>
<t2226>16</t2226>
<t2227>The ceremony of the month took place as usual.</t2227>
<t2228>I lie on my back, fully clothed except for the long white cotton sanitary underwear.</t2228> <t2229>In front of me, if I were to open my eyes, is the wide white curtain stretched over the oversized colonial-style four-poster bed of Serena Joy, hovering like a waterlogged cloud above, a cloud embroidered with tiny silver raindrops, which upon closer inspection reveal themselves to be four-petaled flowers.</t2229> <t2230>I would not be able to change the carpet, which is white, nor the curtains also embroidered with branches, nor the dressing table draped with cloth and a set of silver-framed mirror and comb; I can only see the curtain, thanks to the thin transparent silk combined with its sagging curve, skillfully evoking both materiality and etherealness at the same time.</t2230>
<t2231>Or the sail of a ship.</t2231> <t2232>The sail full of wind, as was once said, a poetic way.</t2232> <t2233>The belly full and taut.</t2233> <t2234>Speeding forward thanks to the round, taut belly.</t2234>
<t2235>The mist of Lily flowers in the valley lingered around, cold and icy as well.</t2235> <t2236>This room is not warm.</t2236>
<t2237>Above, near the head of the bed, Serena Joy had taken her position, spread wide.</t2237> <t2238>Her legs were spread to either side, I lay in between, my head resting on her belly, her pubic bone supporting the base of my skull, her thighs gripping either side of my body.</t2238> <t2239>She was also fully clothed.</t2239>
<t2240>My two hands are raised; she takes my hands, one hand each.</t2240> <t2241>This is considered to imply that we are of one flesh, one entity.</t2241> <t2242>The real meaning, however, is that she holds control, throughout the entire process, and thus the product of that process as well.</t2242> <t2243>If there is any.</t2243> <t2244>The rings on her left hand cut into my fingers.</t2244> <t2245>It could be revenge, or it might not be.</t2245>
<t2246>The red dress was hitched up to my waist, though that was the end of it.</t2246> <t2247>Beneath it, the Commander was fucking.</t2247> <t2248>The target was my lower body.</t2248> <t2249>I don't call it making love, because he wasn't making love.</t2249> <t2250>Copulation isn't accurate either, because that implies both parties are participating, and here it's just one.</t2250> <t2251>Rape isn't appropriate either: everything happening here has my consent.</t2251> <t2252>There weren't many choices, but there were some, and I chose this one.</t2252>
<t2253>So I lay still and sketched in my mind the invisible curtain.</t2253> <t2254>I remembered Queen Victoria's advice to her daughter: Just close your eyes and think of England.</t2254> <t2255>But this is not England.</t2255> <t2256>I wished he would hurry up and get it over with.</t2256>
<t2257>It is also possible that I am going crazy and this is a new form of therapy.</t2257>
<t2258>I wish it were true; that way the illness could progress, and this matter would end.</t2258>
<t2259>Serena Joy squeezed my hand as if she, not I, were the one being fucked, as if she were the one feeling either pleasure or pain, and the Commander continued, in a two-four marching rhythm, repeating like a dripping faucet.</t2259> <t2260>He was lost somewhere, like someone humming in the bath without realizing it, as if preoccupied with something else in his mind.</t2260> <t2261>As if he were waiting for himself to arrive, fingers tapping on the table.</t2261> <t2262>His rhythm now seemed urgent.</t2262> <t2263>But isn't this the ideal sexual fantasy - two women at once?</t2263> <t2264>That's what they often say.</t2264> <t2265>Extremely stimulating, they often say.</t2265>
<t2266>As for what is happening in this room, under Serena Joy's silver veil, there is nothing stimulating.</t2266> <t2267>It has nothing to do with passion or love or romance or any of the concepts we used to heat ourselves up with in the past.</t2267> <t2268>It has nothing to do with sexual desire, at least for me, and certainly not for Serena.</t2268> <t2269>Being aroused or reaching climax is no longer considered a requirement; those things are now just signs of frivolity, like lace garters or beauty marks: meaningless diversions for the shallow.</t2269> <t2270>Outdated.</t2270> <t2271>It's somewhat bizarre to recall that women used to spend so much time and effort on these matters, reading about them, thinking about them, worrying, writing about them too.</t2271> <t2272>The recreational nature is too obvious.</t2272>
<t2273>This is not entertainment, not even for the Commander.</t2273> <t2274>This is serious business. Even the Commander, he is also fulfilling his duty.</t2274>
<t2275>If I slightly open my eyes, I will see him, a face not too unattractive floating above his body, a few strands of gray hair perhaps fluttering in front of his forehead, focused on the journey inside, on the position he is hastily aiming for, the destination like in a dream receding at the same speed he advances.</t2275> <t2276>I will see his open eyes.</t2276>
<t2277>If he were more handsome, would I be more interested?</t2277>
<t2278>At least he is an improvement over the previous one, who smelled like a church cloakroom on a rainy day, like a dentist's office when they start scaling your teeth, like a nostril.</t2278> <t2279>This commander, on the other hand, exudes the scent of mothballs; or is it some kind of aftershave designed to cause misery? Why does he have to wear that ridiculous uniform?</t2279> <t2280>But would his pale, slightly hairy naked body be any better for me?</t2280>
<t2281>According to the prohibition on kissing.</t2281> <t2282>Thanks to that, it is still bearable.</t2282>
<t2283>One separates oneself.</t2283> <t2284>One describes.</t2284>
<t2285>Finally, he arrived, letting out a muffled groan as if in relief.</t2285> <t2286>Serena Joy, who had been holding her breath, now exhaled.</t2286> <t2287>The Commander, who had been supporting himself on his elbows to avoid touching the two bodies merged into one, now did not allow himself to sink into us.</t2287> <t2288>He paused for a moment, withdrew, and zipped up.</t2288> <t2289>He nodded, then turned and left the room, closing the door with exaggerated care, as if we were a delicate, ailing mother.</t2289> <t2290>There was something incredibly absurd about this, but I didn't dare laugh.</t2290>
<t2291>Serena Joy let go of my hand.</t2291> <t2292>"You can get up now," she said. "Get up and leave immediately." She should have let me rest for about ten minutes, with my legs raised on a pillow, to increase the chances.</t2292> <t2293>That time should have been for her to contemplate in silence, but now she didn't have the heart to do it.</t2293> <t2294>Her voice was dismissive, as if touching my flesh made her sick, made her feel defiled.</t2294> <t2295>I disentangled myself from her, stood up; the Commander's fluid running down my legs.</t2295> <t2296>Before turning away, I saw her smoothing down her blue dress, closing her legs tightly; she still lay on the bed, staring up at the canopy above, stiff as a mannequin.</t2296>
<t2297>Who has it worse, her or me?</t2297>
<t2298>17</t2298>
<t2299>I do the following things when I return to my room:</t2299>
<t2300>I took off my clothes and changed into pajamas.</t2300>
<t2301>I found a tiny piece of butter in the right shoe, where I had hidden it after the meal.</t2301> <t2302>It was so warm in the cupboard that the butter had melted.</t2302> <t2303>Most of it had soaked into the napkin wrapping.</t2303> <t2304>Now there was butter in the shoe.</t2304> <t2305>It wasn't the first time, because whenever there was butter or even margarine, I would save a little bit that way.</t2305> <t2306>I could extract almost all of the butter from the shoe lining tomorrow, using a towel or toilet paper in the bathroom.</t2306>
<t2307>I rub the butter all over my face, rubbing it into my hands.</t2307> <t2308>There is no more face cream or lotion, not for us.</t2308> <t2309>That too is considered frivolous.</t2309> <t2310>We are containers; only the internal organs matter.</t2310> <t2311>The exterior can harden and wrinkle, like the shell of a chestnut, they don't care.</t2311> <t2312>This is the decree of the Wives, this disappearance of lotion.</t2312> <t2313>They don't want us to look attractive.</t2313> <t2314>To them, the situation is bad enough as it is.</t2314>
<t2315>Butter is a trick learned at the Rachel and Leah Center.</t2315> <t2316>The Red Center, we call it that, because everywhere is all red.</t2316> <t2317>My predecessor in this room, the girl with freckles and a hearty laugh, probably did the same, with butter.</t2317> <t2318>We all did the same.</t2318>
<t2319>As long as we keep doing it - rubbing butter on our faces to soften the skin, we can still believe that one day we will escape, believe that we will be touched again, whether for love or desire.</t2319> <t2320>We also have our own rituals, performed in solitude.</t2320>
<t2321>Butter is very greasy, it will spoil quickly and I will smell like sour cheese; but at least it is a natural nutrient, as they used to say.</t2321>
<t2322>We have already sunk to that level.</t2322>
<t2323>Having spread butter, I lay down on the bed, straight as a piece of toast.</t2323> <t2324>I couldn't sleep.</t2324> <t2325>In the dim light, I kept staring at the blind plaster eye on the ceiling, which was also looking back at me, though it couldn't see.</t2325> <t2326>There was no wind, the white curtains hung limp like two pieces of gauze, faintly visible in the glow of the night lights that always shone around this house - or was it the moon?</t2326>
<t2327>I folded the blanket, carefully got up, barefoot and silent, wearing a nightgown, went to the window, like a child, I wanted to see the moon on the bare chest of newly fallen snow.</t2327> <t2328>The sky was clear but hard to see because of the lights; but indeed, on the dimmed sky, there was a floating, pristine moon, a moon waiting for a wish, a piece of stone from eternity, a goddess, a blink.</t2328> <t2329>The moon is stone while the sky is full of deadly devices, but oh Lord, how beautiful it still is.</t2329>
<t2330>I want Luke so much that I can't describe it.</t2330> <t2331>I want to be hugged, to hear my name called.</t2331> <t2332>I want to be cherished in ways that no longer exist; I want more than just to be precious and important.</t2332> <t2333>I repeat the name from before, reminding myself of what I used to achieve, how I was recognized.</t2333>
<t2334>I want to steal something.</t2334>
<t2335>In the hall, the night lights were still on, the long corridor softly illuminated with a pink hue; I walked, each step cautious, without a creak, following the long carpet, like on the forest floor, stealthily, heart pounding, gliding through the house at night.</t2335> <t2336>I was abandoning my post. A hundred percent illegal.</t2336>
<t2337>Looking down through the ankle mirror on the wall, I saw my white figure, a loose body, hair flowing down like a mane, eyes gleaming.</t2337> <t2338>I like it that way.</t2338> <t2339>I am doing something, by myself, proactively; is that a grammatical tense?</t2339> <t2340>Excited.</t2340> <t2341>What I want to steal is the knife, in the kitchen, but today I'm not ready yet.</t2341>
<t2342>I went to the lounge, the door was ajar, slipped in, and opened the door a bit wider.</t2342> <t2343>The floorboard creaked, but who nearby would hear?</t2343> <t2344>I stood in the middle of the room, waiting for my pupils to dilate, like a cat or an owl.</t2344> <t2345>The smell of old perfume and fabric dust filled the air.</t2345> <t2346>A thin beam of light slipped in through the gap between the drawn curtains, the headlights from outside, I was sure there were two people patrolling out there, I had seen them, from above, from behind my room's curtains, black shapes, like shadow puppets.</t2346> <t2347>Now I could see faint outlines, light shadows: the mirror, the candlestick, some vases, the sofa looming like a cloud at dusk.</t2347>
<t2348>What should be taken? An object that no one will know is missing.</t2348> <t2349>In the forest at midnight, a magical flower.</t2349> <t2350>A wilted daffodil, not from a dry flower arrangement. The daffodil is about to be thrown away, they already have a smell.</t2350> <t2351>Adding to the scent of Serena's lavender perfume, the smell of knitted items.</t2351>
<t2352>I groped around, found the small table, and felt it.</t2352> <t2353>There was a clattering sound, probably something had fallen over.</t2353> <t2354>I found the daffodil vase, the edges of the petals were dry and brittle, near the stem they were limp, I pinched them with my fingers.</t2354> <t2355>I will press this flower, somewhere.</t2355> <t2356>Under the mattress.</t2356> <t2357>Leave it there, for the next woman, who will come after me, to find.</t2357>
<t2358>But there is someone in the room, behind me.</t2358>
<t2359>I hear footsteps, as light as mine, the creaking sound exactly where the floorboard was earlier.</t2359> <t2360>The door closes behind me with a click, blocking the light.</t2360> <t2361>I stiffen: wearing white was a real mistake.</t2361> <t2362>I am snow under the moonlight, even in the dark night.</t2362>
<t2363>Then a whisper: "Don't scream."</t2363> <t2364>"It's okay."</t2364>
<t2365>As if I were about to scream, as if it were really okay.</t2365> <t2366>I turned around: a silhouette, just that, cheekbones slightly glowing, colorless.</t2366>
<t2367>The person walked towards me. Nick.</t2367>
<t2368>What are you doing here?</t2368>
<t2369>I did not answer.</t2369> <t2370>He was also illegal, here, with me, he couldn't accuse me.</t2370> <t2371>I couldn't accuse him either; at this moment, we were friends.</t2371> <t2372>He placed his hand on mine, pulled me close, his mouth on mine, what else could this restraint bring?</t2372> <t2373>Not a word. Both of us trembling, how much I wanted it.</t2373> <t2374>In Serena's parlor, among the dried flowers, on the Chinese rug, his slender body.</t2374> <t2375>A complete stranger. It would be like screaming out loud, like pointing a gun at someone.</t2375> <t2376>My hand slipped down, what if I did, I could unbutton, and then.</t2376> <t2377>But it was too dangerous, he knew, we pushed each other away, not too far.</t2377> <t2378>Too much trust, too much recklessness, this was already too much.</t2378>
<t2379>“I came here to find you,” he said, whispering, almost right next to my ear.</t2379> <t2380>I wanted to rise up, taste his skin, he made me hungry.</t2380> <t2381>Those fingers moved, exploring my hand under the sleeve of my nightgown, as if they didn't want to obey reason. How wonderful it is, to be touched by someone else, to be eagerly sought after, to be eagerly sought after.</t2381> <t2382>Luke, you know, you understand.</t2382> <t2383>It's you, in another form.</t2383>
<t2384>Damn it.</t2384>
<t2385>“What are you doing?” I said.</t2385> <t2386>Could it be that he couldn't stand it, to the point of risking his life to come to my room at night?</t2386> <t2387>I remembered those who were hung on the hooks on the Wall.</t2387> <t2388>I wanted to collapse.</t2388> <t2389>I had to go, back to the stairs, before I completely vanished.</t2389> <t2390>His hand placed on my shoulder, steady, heavy, pressing down like hot lead.</t2390> <t2391>Is this worth dying for?</t2391> <t2392>I'm a coward, I hate being in pain.</t2392>
<t2393>“He sent me,” Nick said.</t2393> <t2394>“He wants to see you.</t2394> <t2395>In the office.”</t2395>
<t2396>"What did you say?" I said.</t2396> <t2397>The commander, of course.</t2397> <t2398>Meet me?</t2398>
<t2399>What do you mean by meeting someone?</t2399> <t2400>Isn't he already done with me?</t2400>
<t2401>“Tomorrow,” he said, just loud enough to hear.</t2401> <t2402>In the darkness of the lobby, we parted ways, very slowly, as if drawn together by a force, a current, only to be pushed apart by equally strong arms.</t2402>
<t2403>I found the door, turned the knob, my fingers touched the cold porcelain and opened it.</t2403> <t2404>That's all I could do.</t2404>
<t2405>VII - Night</t2405>
<t2406>18</t2406>
<t2407>I lay on the bed, still trembling.</t2407> <t2408>One can wet the rim of a glass and then rub a finger around it, producing a sound.</t2408> <t2409>I am feeling exactly like that: the sound of glass ringing.</t2409> <t2410>It feels like shattering.</t2410> <t2411>I want to be with someone.</t2411>
<t2412>Lying on the bed, with Luke, his hand placed on my round, bulging belly.</t2412> <t2413>The three of us, on the bed, the baby keeps kicking and turning inside me.</t2413> <t2414>It's stormy, that's why the baby is awake, they can hear it, they sleep, they can get startled, even in there, next to the heart that soothes, like waves pushing against the shore around them.</t2414> <t2415>Lightning flashes, quite close, Luke's eyes momentarily white and bright.</t2415>
<t2416>I'm not afraid. We are all awake, the rain is pouring down, we will proceed slowly and cautiously.</t2416>
<t2417>If I thought this wouldn't happen again, I would probably be dead.</t2417>
<t2418>But that's boring, no one dies from lack of sex.</t2418> <t2419>We die from lack of love.</t2419> <t2420>There is no one here for me to love, everyone I could love is either dead or scattered elsewhere.</t2420> <t2421>Who knows where they are now, what names they go by? It doesn't matter if they are nowhere, just as I am to them now.</t2421> <t2422>I am also a missing person.</t2422>
<t2423>Every now and then I see their faces, emerging in the darkness, flickering like images of saints in old foreign churches, through the light of wind-blown candles; people light them to pray, kneeling, their foreheads pressed against the backs of wooden pews, hoping for an answer.</t2423> <t2424>I can summon them, but they are only illusions, they do not stay.</t2424> <t2425>Am I despicable for craving a real body, one I can hold in my arms?</t2425> <t2426>Burning it all would be like shedding my own body.</t2426> <t2427>I keep listening to my heartbeat against the mattress springs, keep caressing myself, under the dry white blanket, in the darkness, but I too am dry and white, hard, rough; it's no different than running my hand over a plate of dry rice; no different than snow.</t2427> <t2428>All I taste is the flavor of death, the flavor of abandonment.</t2428> <t2429>I am a room that has witnessed much and now has nothing left, except for the pollen of wild grasses growing by the window, blown in by the wind like dust on the floor.</t2429>
<t2430>This is what I believe.</t2430>
<t2431>I believe Luke is lying face down in a bush, a tangled fern grove, last year's dried compound leaves mingling with the newly smoothed-out young leaves, or perhaps even a hemlock grove, though it's not yet the season for red berries.</t2431> <t2432>What remains of him: hair, bones, a green and black plaid sweater, leather belt, boots.</t2432> <t2433>I know exactly what he is wearing.</t2433> <t2434>I can still see his clothes in my mind, as clear as a lithograph or a color advertisement from an old magazine, even though I can't see his face, not clearly.</t2434> <t2435>His face is fading away, perhaps because it never stays still: it has many different expressions, unlike his clothes.</t2435>
<t2436>I pray for that hole, or two or three of them, not just one gunshot, but successive ones, I pray for at least one hole to neatly, quickly, and thoroughly pierce through his skull, through the place where all images are stored, so that there is only a single flash, whether it be darkness or pain, hopefully just a subtle one, like the word "thud," a flash and then silence.</t2436>
<t2437>I believe so.</t2437>
<t2438>I also believe that Luke is sitting upright, in a rectangular room somewhere, gray cement, on the edge or rim of something, a chair or a bed.</t2438> <t2439>What he is wearing, only God knows, whatever they have dressed him in. And it's not just God who knows, so maybe there's a way to find out.</t2439> <t2440>His beard hasn't been shaved for a year, though his hair is cut short, whenever they feel like it, to prevent lice, they say.</t2440> <t2441>This I need to correct: if they cut his hair to prevent lice, they would also cut his beard.</t2441> <t2442>Logically.</t2442>
<t2443>Even so, they did it clumsily, hair disheveled, neck scratched all over, even worse, he looked a decade older, twenty years older, his back bent like an old man, eyes sunken, tiny purple blood vessels on his cheeks burst, there was a scar, no, a wound, it still hadn't healed, a bruised purple color, near the base, under his left cheek where the flesh was recently cut.</t2443> <t2444>How vulnerable the human body is, how easily it can be discarded, entirely just water and organic matter, not much more than a jellyfish, dried up on the sandy shore.</t2444>
<t2445>He feels a sharp pain every time he moves his arm, every time he moves.</t2445> <t2446>He doesn't know what he's being accused of.</t2446> <t2447>It's going to be difficult.</t2447> <t2448>There must be something, there must be a crime to accuse.</t2448> <t2449>If not, why are they detaining him, why isn't he dead yet?</t2449> <t2450>He must know something they want to know.</t2450> <t2451>I can't imagine.</t2451> <t2452>I can't imagine that he still hasn't said that something.</t2452> <t2453>If it were me, I would have already said it.</t2453>
<t2454>He was immersed in a smell, his smell, the smell of a beast trapped in a filthy cage.</t2454><t2455>I imagined him at rest, because I couldn't imagine him doing anything else, just as I couldn't picture anything beneath the collar around his neck, above the handcuffs.</t2455><t2456>I didn't want to imagine what they had done to his body.</t2456><t2457>Did he have shoes?</t2457><t2458>No, and the floor was damp and cold.</t2458><t2459>Did he know I was here, still alive, did he know I was thinking about him? I had to believe so.</t2459><t2460>In desperate circumstances, one must believe in a hundred different things.</t2460><t2461>Now I even believed in telepathy, vibrations transmitted through ether, and even more nonsense.</t2461><t2462>Never before.</t2462>
<t2463>I also believe that in the end, they did not catch or overtake you, that you escaped, reached the shore, swam across the river, crossed the border, drifted to the other side, an island, teeth chattering; found your way to a nearby farm, were let in, initially with suspicion, but then when they understood, they were very kind, not the type to turn you in, perhaps Quakers, who would secretly take you further inland, from house to house, the lady of the house making you hot coffee, giving you her husband's clothes.</t2463> <t2464>I sketch the clothes.</t2464> <t2465>Feeling at ease knowing you are warmly dressed.</t2465>
<t2466>Contact those people, there must be a resistance force, an exiled government.</t2466> <t2467>There must be someone out there, taking care of everything.</t2467> <t2468>I believe in the existence of a resistance force as much as I believe there can't be darkness without light; or conversely, there can't be darkness unless there is light.</t2468> <t2469>There must be resistance, otherwise, where would all those criminals shown on TV come from?</t2469>
<t2470>Now, there could be news about him any day.</t2470> <t2471>It will come in the most unexpected way, from the person I least expect, someone I never thought of.</t2471> <t2472>Placed under a plate, in the food tray? Slipped into my hand when passing the ticket over the Meat counter?</t2472>
<t2473>The note will tell me to be patient: sooner or later he will rescue me, we will find our child, no matter where they have taken them.</t2473> <t2474>The child still remembers their parents and the three of us will be reunited as before.</t2474> <t2475>In the meantime, I need to persevere and wait for the right moment.</t2475> <t2476>What has happened to me, what is happening to me, won't change anything; he still loves me, he knows this isn't my fault.</t2476> <t2477>The note will say that too.</t2477> <t2478>This very note, which may never come, has kept me alive.</t2478> <t2479>I believe in it.</t2479>
<t2480>The things I believe cannot all be true, though at least one of the three must be.</t2480> <t2481>But I believe in all three, three versions of Luke, at the same time.</t2481> <t2482>This contradictory way of believing, now, to me, is the only way to believe anything.</t2482> <t2483>Whatever the truth may be, I am ready to face it.</t2483>
<t2484>That is another thing I am sure of.</t2484> <t2485>This too could be wrong.</t2485>
<t2486>The tombstone in the cemetery near the old church has an engraving of an anchor and an hourglass, along with the word Hope.</t2486>
<t2487>Hope.</t2487> <t2488>Why do they write that on the head of the dead? Is the corpse in the grave hoping, or are the living ones?</t2488>
<t2489>Does Luke hope or not?</t2489>
<t2490>VIII - Date of Birth</t2490>
<t2491>19</t2491>
<t2492>I dream that I am awake.</t2492>
<t2493>I see myself getting out of bed and walking across the room, not this room, out the door, not this door.</t2493> <t2494>I am at home, one of the houses I used to live in, and the child runs to me, wearing a small blue nightgown, with a sunflower printed on the chest, barefoot, and then I pick the child up and feel their limbs wrapping around me and I cry, because at that moment I know I am dreaming.</t2494> <t2495>I see myself back in bed, then waking up, and waking up sitting on the edge of the bed, and my mother brings in a tray and asks if I am feeling better.</t2495> <t2496>Every time I was sick, when I was little, my mother had to take time off work to stay home.</t2496> <t2497>But this time I haven't woken up yet either.</t2497>
<t2498>After these dreams, I woke up completely, and knew I was awake when I saw that wreath again, on the ceiling, both curtains hanging down like the white hair of a drowned person.</t2498> <t2499>I felt dizzy as if drugged.</t2499> <t2500>I pondered this possibility: maybe they had drugged me.</t2500> <t2501>Maybe my life, which I thought was real, is just an illusion.</t2501>
<t2502>Zero hope.</t2502> <t2503>I know where I am, who I am, and what day it is today.</t2503> <t2504>Three questions to check, I am completely sane. A clear mind is a priceless treasure; I store it like people used to store money.</t2504> <t2505>I save it, to have enough when needed, when the time comes.</t2505>
<t2506>The gray light filters through the curtains, dimly bright, it's not very sunny today.</t2506> <t2507>I get out of bed, go to the window, kneel on the sill, the small hard pillow, FAITH, looking outside.</t2507> <t2508>There's nothing to see.</t2508>
<t2509>I wonder where those two went.</t2509> <t2510>It must have been a trio at first. HOPE and CHARITY, where have they been sent?</t2510> <t2511>Serena Joy is used to neatness.</t2511> <t2512>She wouldn't throw away anything that isn't too worn out.</t2512> <t2513>One for Rita, the other for Cora perhaps?</t2513>
<t2514>The bell rang; I woke up early, before the time.</t2514> <t2515>I got dressed, without looking down.</t2515>
<t2516>I sit on the chair and think about the word "chair".</t2516> <t2517>Chair.</t2517> <t2518>It also means the head of a meeting.</t2518> <t2519>It is also a method of execution.</t2519> <t2520>Pronounced, it is the beginning of "charity," kindness.</t2520> <t2521>In French, it means "flesh".</t2521> <t2522>These things have nothing to do with each other.</t2522>
<t2523>This is my daily prayer book, to prepare myself.</t2523>
<t2524>In front of me is a tray, on it a glass of apple juice, a vitamin pill, a spoon, three slices of brown bread on a plate, another small plate holding honey, a third plate supporting an egg cup, shaped like the waist of a woman, wearing a skirt.</t2524> <t2525>The skirt covers the second egg, keeping it warm.</t2525> <t2526>The cup is made of white porcelain with a blue glaze.</t2526>
<t2527>The egg on top is white.</t2527> <t2528>I move the cup a bit, so it catches the shimmering sunlight streaming through the window, which lands on the tray, glows, fades, and then glows again.</t2528> <t2529>The eggshell is smooth but also slightly gritty; the small calcium deposits are accentuated by the sunlight, like the craters of the moon.</t2529> <t2530>The scene is barren, but perfect; an ideal desert for saints to retreat, keeping their minds undisturbed by the bustling outside world.</t2530> <t2531>I think God must look exactly like this: like an egg.</t2531> <t2532>Who knows, maybe life on the moon doesn't exist on the surface, but within its core.</t2532>
<t2533>Now the egg is glowing, as if emitting energy on its own.</t2533> <t2534>Watching it gives me indescribable pleasure.</t2534>
<t2535>The sun sets, the egg goes out.</t2535>
<t2536>I picked up the egg and fiddled with it for a moment. Warm.</t2536> <t2537>In the old days, women would carry these eggs between their breasts, incubating them until they hatched.</t2537> <t2538>It must have felt quite interesting.</t2538>
<t2539>Life is extremely simple.</t2539> <t2540>Happiness = an egg.</t2540> <t2541>Blessings can be counted on one hand.</t2541> <t2542>But perhaps this is exactly the reaction people expect from me.</t2542> <t2543>I have the egg, what more could I ask for?</t2543>
<t2544>In circumstances of declining aspirations, the will to live attaches itself to the strangest objects.</t2544> <t2545>If only I had some animal: a bird, for instance, or a cat.</t2545> <t2546>A pet. An animal that is at least somewhat familiar.</t2546> <t2547>A mouse would do as well, if necessary, but I don't expect to get one.</t2547> <t2548>This house is too clean.</t2548>
<t2549>I took a spoon, cracked the top of the egg, and ate the inside.</t2549>
<t2550>While eating the second fruit, I heard the sound of a siren, at first very distant, winding through large houses and neatly trimmed lawns, the sound buzzing like an insect; then it came closer, blooming, like a flower of sound bursting into a brass trumpet.</t2550> <t2551>What announcement is this, this siren sound.</t2551> <t2552>I put down the spoon, my heart leaping, I went to the window again: what if it's blue, not meant for me?</t2552> <t2553>But I saw it turn in, speeding down the street, stopping right in front of the house, still blaring loudly, and painted red.</t2553> <t2554>Good news, rarely seen these days.</t2554> <t2555>I left the half-eaten egg, hurriedly went to the closet to get my coat, already hearing footsteps on the stairs and a call.</t2555>
<t2556>“Hurry up,” said Cora, “no one is going to wait all day,” and she helped me put on my shirt, she even laughed.</t2556>
<t2557>I almost ran through the hall, sliding down the stairs like a snow hill, the front door wide open, today I was allowed to pass through, and the Guard stood there, bowing.</t2557> <t2558>It started to rain, a light drizzle, and the smell of earth and growing grass filled the air.</t2558>
<t2559>The red-colored Van stopped right at the entrance.</t2559> <t2560>The back door opened, and I clumsily climbed in.</t2560> <t2561>The car's floor mat was red, and red curtains were draped over the car windows.</t2561> <t2562>Inside, there were already three women, sitting on two long benches running along both sides. The Guard closed the two back doors and locked them, then sat in the front seat next to the driver; through the iron mesh lined with glass, the backs of their heads could be seen.</t2562> <t2563>The car jerked once and then started moving, the siren above still shrieking loudly: Make way, make way!</t2563>
<t2564>"Who is that?" I asked the woman next to me; speaking into her ear, or where her ear might be under the scarf.</t2564> <t2565>I almost had to shout, the whistle was too loud.</t2565>
<t2566>“Ofwarren,” she shouted back. Instinctively, she grabbed my hand, squeezing it tightly, as the car jerked around the corner; she turned to me and I saw her face, tears rolling down her cheeks, but why?</t2566> <t2567>Jealousy, disappointment?</t2567> <t2568>But no, she was laughing, she threw her arms around me, I had never met her before, she hugged me, her large breasts under the red outfit, she wiped her face with her sleeve.</t2568> <t2569>A day like today we could do whatever we wanted.</t2569>
<t2570>Correction needed: within the framework.</t2570>
<t2571>Opposite on the other bench, a woman is praying, eyes closed, hand touching her mouth.</t2571> <t2572>Or maybe not.</t2572> <t2573>Maybe she is biting her thumbnail.</t2573> <t2574>Perhaps she is calm.</t2574> <t2575>The third person has already calmed down, arms crossed, mouth slightly smiling.</t2575> <t2576>The siren is still blaring continuously.</t2576> <t2577>In the past, this sound signaled death, guiding ambulances or fire trucks.</t2577> <t2578>Who knows, it might signal death today as well.</t2578> <t2579>We'll know soon enough.</t2579> <t2580>What will Ofwarren give birth to? A baby, as everyone hopes?</t2580> <t2581>Or not, a defective child, with a flat head or a snout like a dog's, one head with two bodies, a heart with holes or no arms, or webbed fingers?</t2581> <t2582>There's no way to know.</t2582> <t2583>In the past, there were machines to check, but now they are banned.</t2583> <t2584>And what good would it do to know?</t2584> <t2585>You can't pull them out; whatever it is, it has to be born.</t2585>
<t2586>The probability is one-fourth, we were told at the Center.</t2586> <t2587>The air was filled with chemicals, once, then radiation, the water full of toxins, it would take years to purify, and in the meantime, they had infiltrated your bodies, residing in your fat tissues.</t2587> <t2588>Who knows, your flesh might already be contaminated, dirty like an oil-slicked beach, ensuring death for seabirds and your future children.</t2588> <t2589>Who knows, vultures that eat your corpses might also drop dead.</t2589> <t2590>Who knows, you might glow brightly, like an old-fashioned clock, in the night.</t2590> <t2591>The night of the death watch.</t2591> <t2592>There is a type of beetle with that name, specialized in burying decaying corpses.</t2592>
<t2593>Sometimes I cannot think about myself, my body, without sketching out a skeleton: my image before an electron.</t2593> <t2594>The cradle of life, woven from bones; and inside, a hundred perils, malformed proteins, crystals jagged like shards of glass.</t2594> <t2595>Women taking all kinds of medicine, men spraying chemicals on plants, cows eating grass, sources of detoxifying water flowing into the river one after another.</t2595> <t2596>Not to mention a few nuclear plants along the San Andreas fault line that exploded during several earthquakes, caused by nature, not by anyone, and a mutated strain of syphilis that no antibiotic can cure.</t2596> <t2597>Some even do it themselves, using catgut to tie it off or chemicals to cause permanent damage.</t2597> <t2598>How can it be, Aunt Lydia said: how can the heavens commit such a colossal act? The Jezebels! Disdaining the gift from God! Twisted hands.</t2598>
<t2599>You face great dangers, Aunt Lydia said, but as the vanguard, you will march at the forefront, into perilous territory.</t2599> <t2600>The greater the danger, the greater the glory.</t2600> <t2601>She clasped her hands tightly, beaming brightly at our outward display of courage.</t2601> <t2602>We lowered our faces to look at the table.</t2602> <t2603>After going through everything, ending up as a cutting machine: not a pretty prospect.</t2603> <t2604>We did not know exactly the fate of the babies who did not make it, those declared as Unbabies.</t2604> <t2605>But we knew they would be discarded, somewhere, completely.</t2605>
<t2606>There isn't just a single cause, Aunt Lydia said.</t2606> <t2607>She stood in front of the class, in her khaki outfit, holding a pointer.</t2607> <t2608>In front of the blackboard, where a map used to be, there was a drop-down chart showing birth rates, per thousand, over many years: a steeply declining line, plunging below the horizontal axis which represents the population replacement level, lower and lower.</t2608>
<t2609>Of course, among women, there are those who believe there is no future anymore; they think the world will explode.</t2609> <t2610>They use that as an excuse, Aunt Lydia said.</t2610> <t2611>They say that giving birth is meaningless.</t2611> <t2612>Aunt's nostrils flared: so cruel.</t2612> <t2613>Those people are lazy, she said.</t2613> <t2614>Wretched whores.</t2614>
<t2615>On the table where I sit, there are initials carved into the wood, accompanied by dates.</t2615> <t2616>Sometimes they come in pairs, embraced by the word "love."</t2616> <t2617>J. H. loves B. P. 1954. O. R. loves L. T. I look at them like engravings on cave walls, which I read about in books long ago, or drawings made with soot mixed with animal fat.</t2617> <t2618>They seem to belong to ancient times.</t2618> <t2619>The tabletop is made of light-colored wood, slightly sloped, with a spot on the right to rest your arm, which you can lean on when writing, on paper, with a pen.</t2619> <t2620>The desk drawer can store all sorts of things: books, notebooks.</t2620> <t2621>Those old habits now seem so luxurious to me, almost decadent; as corrupt as wild feasts in a barbaric society.</t2621> <t2622>M. loves G. 1972.</t2622> <t2623>This engraving, repeatedly traced over with pencil on the varnish that has peeled off, contains the sorrow of all fallen civilizations.</t2623> <t2624>Just like a handprint on stone.</t2624> <t2625>Its owner, whoever they were, once lived.</t2625>
<t2626>There was no day in the latter half of the 80s.</t2626> <t2627>This was probably among the schools that were closed back then, due to a lack of students.</t2627>
<t2628>They made many mistakes, Aunt Lydia said.</t2628> <t2629>We will not repeat them.</t2629> <t2630>Her voice was devout, yet condescending, in the manner of someone who feels obligated to tell us unpleasant truths, only for our own good.</t2630> <t2631>I wanted to strangle her.</t2631> <t2632>I pushed the thought away as soon as it came.</t2632>
<t2633>Objects have value, auntie said, only when they are rare and hard to find.</t2633> <t2634>We want our girls to have value.</t2634> <t2635>Auntie is very rich in silences, savored thoroughly in her mouth.</t2635> <t2636>Consider yourself a pearl.</t2636> <t2637>Here we are, sitting in a row, eyes downcast, we make auntie drool with morality.</t2637> <t2638>We are subject to auntie's definitions, we must endure her adjectives.</t2638>
<t2639>I think about pearls.</t2639> <t2640>Pearls are the condensed saliva of oysters.</t2640> <t2641>I will tell this to Moira later, if possible.</t2641>
<t2642>We are here to lick the milk off you girls, Aunt Lydia said, cheerful and satisfied.</t2642>
<t2643>The vehicle stopped, the rear door opened, and the Guards herded us out.</t2643> <t2644>Right at the main entrance, another Guard stood, a machine gun with a distinctive short barrel slung over his shoulder.</t2644> <t2645>We lined up through the main entrance, under the light drizzle, as the Guards bowed.</t2645> <t2646>The large Emergency vehicle, carrying equipment and mobile doctors, was parked further away at the roundabout.</t2646> <t2647>There was a doctor by the vehicle door looking out.</t2647> <t2648>I wondered what they were doing in there, passing the time.</t2648> <t2649>Playing cards, perhaps, or reading books; typical male pastimes.</t2649> <t2650>Generally, they were seldom needed; they were only allowed in if there was no other option.</t2650>
<t2651>In the old days, it was very different; they were the ones on the front lines, how shameful it was, Aunt Lydia said.</t2651> <t2652>Disgraceful.</t2652> <t2653>She had just shown a film, shot in an old-time hospital: a pregnant woman, connected to some machine, electrodes bristling all over her body like a dead robot, an intravenous tube inserted into the vein in her arm.</t2653> <t2654>Someone holding a spotlight peered between her legs, which had been shaved clean, an ordinary smooth young girl, a tray glistening with sterilized knives, everyone wearing masks.</t2654> <t2655>The patient was very cooperative.</t2655> <t2656>In the old days, they used to anesthetize women, induce contractions, cut them open, and sew them back up.</t2656> <t2657>It was over.</t2657> <t2658>Even the local anesthetic, over.</t2658> <t2659>Aunt Elizabeth said it was better for the baby, but not only that: I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth; in pain, you will give birth to children.</t2659> <t2660>A necessary item in the lunch menu, along with brown bread and lettuce sandwiches.</t2660>
<t2661>While climbing the stairs, which were very wide, with two large stone pedestals on either side - the Commander of Ofwarren must have a higher status than our household - I heard another whistle.</t2661> <t2662>The blue Birthmobile, carrying the Wives.</t2662> <t2663>That means Serena Joy, arriving with grandeur.</t2663> <t2664>Not sitting on benches, they have proper seats, upholstered.</t2664> <t2665>Looking straight ahead, not obstructed by any screens.</t2665> <t2666>They know exactly where they are going.</t2666>
<t2667>Surely Serena Joy used to come here for tea, in this very house.</t2667> <t2668>Surely Ofwarren, formerly the coquettish Janine, was paraded before her, her and the other Wives, so they could look at her belly, maybe even touch it, and congratulate the Wife of the house.</t2668> <t2669>She's a healthy girl, quite muscular.</t2669> <t2670>The family doesn't carry Agent Orange, checked the records, better safe than sorry.</t2670> <t2671>And someone kind might say: Would you like a cookie?</t2671>
<t2672>Oh, come on, you spoil her too much, it's not good for the girls to have too much sugar.</t2672>
<t2673>One won't hurt, just this time, Mildred.</t2673>
<t2674>And Janine whined: Just one, ma'am, please, okay????</t2674>
<t2675>Indeed, so well-behaved and skillful, not sullen like many others, once the work is done, that's it.</t2675> <t2676>Just like your daughter, isn't it? You could say that.</t2676> <t2677>A member of the family.</t2677> <t2678>Lightly smiling with the confidence of a lady of the house.</t2678> <t2679>It's done, dear, go back to your room.</t2679>
<t2680>And when she was out: Little whores, all of them, but who can be too picky.</t2680> <t2681>Whatever they give, you just reach out and take it, right, girls?</t2681> <t2682>From the mouth of the Lady Commander, mine.</t2682>
<t2683>Oh, but you were really lucky.</t2683> <t2684>There are many kids, oh my, who aren't even clean.</t2684> <t2685>And they never smile, dragging themselves around the room all day, not washing their hair, oh the smell.</t2685> <t2686>I had to make the Marthas barge in, practically dunk them in the tub, had to bribe them to take a bath, had to scare them out of their wits.</t2686>
<t2687>I had to resort to strong measures with my child, and now he doesn't bother to have a proper dinner anymore; as for that other matter, there's not a trace of it, even though it used to be so frequent at my house.</t2687> <t2688>But as for this little one, what an honor for you.</t2688> <t2689>Just a day or two left, oh my, you must be so excited, the girl is as big as a house now, I bet you're extremely anxious.</t2689>
<t2690>Refill? She politely changed the subject.</t2690>
<t2691>I know how the events will unfold.</t2691>
<t2692>And Janine, in the room upstairs, what is she doing? Sitting with the taste of sugar still in her mouth, licking her lips.</t2692> <t2693>Staring aimlessly out the door.</t2693> <t2694>Breathing in and out.</t2694> <t2695>Caressing her swollen breasts.</t2695> <t2696>Not thinking about anything.</t2696>
<t2697>20</t2697>
<t2698>The main staircase was wider than our house, with two curved handrails on either side.</t2698> <t2699>From above, the murmuring prayers of the women who arrived earlier could be heard.</t2699> <t2700>We ascended the staircase, in single file, careful not to step on the trailing hems of the robes in front of us.</t2700> <t2701>To the left, the dining room door was wide open, revealing a long table inside, covered with a white cloth, set for a buffet: bacon with cheese, oranges - this house had oranges! - and freshly baked bread with pastries.</t2701> <t2702>For us, there would be milk and sandwiches, brought on trays, at the end of the hour.</t2702> <t2703>But they had a coffee urn, and a few bottles of wine too; on such a triumphant day, why wouldn't the Ladies indulge a little? They would wait for the results first, then feast afterwards.</t2703> <t2704>Right now, they were all gathered in the lounge on the other side of the staircase, encouraging the Lady of the house, Lady Warren.</t2704> <t2705>Small and frail, she lay on the floor, in a white cotton nightgown, her graying hair spread out like a frosty mold on the carpet; they massaged her emaciated belly, as if she were about to give birth herself.</t2705>
<t2706>The commander, of course, had disappeared without a trace.</t2706> <t2707>He had gone to a place reserved for men on such occasions, some secluded spot.</t2707> <t2708>He was probably guessing when his promotion would be announced, assuming everything went smoothly.</t2708> <t2709>Now, that matter was as certain as nails.</t2709>
<t2710>Ofwarren is in the Commander's bedroom, a very fitting name: the place where the Commander and his Wife lay down every night.</t2710> <t2711>She is sitting on the Commander's bed, leaning against a pile of pillows: Janine, swollen but diminished, her old name has been cut off.</t2711> <t2712>She is wearing a short white cotton dress, rolled up above her thighs; her long broom-colored hair is tied back, out of the way.</t2712> <t2713>Her eyes are tightly shut, like this I could almost like her.</t2713> <t2714>After all, she belongs to our group; what else does she want but to live as comfortably as possible?</t2714> <t2715>Do any of us want anything else? The trouble is in the timing.</t2715> <t2716>She is managing not badly, given her circumstances.</t2716>
<t2717>Two strange women stood on either side of her, squeezing her hands, or she squeezed theirs.</t2717> <t2718>The third woman lifted her shirt, poured baby oil onto her enormous belly, and gradually rubbed it downwards.</t2718> <t2719>By her feet stood Aunt Elizabeth, still in her military-pocketed khaki dress; at the main center, she taught Gynecological Education.</t2719> <t2720>I could only see half of her face, but I knew it was her, with her sharp nose and very defined, strong chin.</t2720> <t2721>Next to her was the Birthing Stool, a double chair with a high backrest that rose up like a throne behind the seat.</t2721> <t2722>Janine had not been placed on it yet, as it was not time.</t2722> <t2723>Blankets were ready, a small basin for bathing, and a bowl of ice chips for Janine to suck on.</t2723>
<t2724>The remaining people sat cross-legged on the carpet; quite a large crowd, the entire district needed to be present.</t2724> <t2725>There must have been twenty-five, thirty people.</t2725> <t2726>Not every Commander had a Handmaid: some Wives could bear children themselves.</t2726> <t2727>She did according to her ability, as per the slogan, he enjoyed according to his needs.</t2727> <t2728>We read that sentence three times, after dessert.</t2728> <t2729>They said it was quoted from the Bible.</t2729> <t2730>Again, Saint Paul, the Acts of the Apostles.</t2730>
<t2731>You are the transitional generation, Aunt Lydia said.</t2731> <t2732>The greatest difficulties fall upon you.</t2732> <t2733>We know how society expects you to sacrifice.</t2733> <t2734>The hardest part is when people curse you.</t2734> <t2735>Those who come after will have it easier.</t2735> <t2736>They will willingly fulfill their duties.</t2736>
<t2737>Auntie didn't say: Because they have no memory, that there is another way to go.</t2737>
<t2738>She said: Because they will not desire the impossible.</t2738>
<t2739>Once a week we watch a movie, after lunch before taking a nap.</t2739> <t2740>We sit on the floor of the Home Economics room, on a small gray mat, waiting for Aunt Helena and Aunt Lydia to finish wrestling with the projector system.</t2740> <t2741>If we're lucky, they won't insert the film reel backward.</t2741> <t2742>To me, it recalls geography class at my school a thousand years ago, watching documentaries about the outside world; women in long skirts or cheap floral dresses, carrying bundles of firewood, baskets, or water buckets from some river, with a child slung on their back in a shawl or net carrier, glancing furtively or sideways from the screen at us, aware that the machine with the glass eye is doing something to them but not knowing what.</t2742> <t2743>Those kinds of films are comforting and a bit boring.</t2743> <t2744>They make me sleepy, even when they pan to men, bare muscles, tirelessly digging the barren land with old-fashioned hoes or shovels, pushing carts of stones.</t2744> <t2745>I prefer the films with dancing, singing, witch masks, and carved artifacts that produce music: feathers, bronze knobs, mother-of-pearl shells, drums.</t2745> <t2746>I like seeing these people happy, not suffering, starving, emaciated, working themselves to death for some trivial purpose, a well that needs digging, a field that needs watering, things that civilized nations solved ages ago.</t2746> <t2747>I think someone just needs to bring them technology and then let them manage on their own.</t2747>
<t2748>Aunt Lydia does not show those types of movies.</t2748>
<t2749>Sometimes it's an old pornographic film, from the seventies or eighties.</t2749> <t2750>Women kneeling, sucking on a penis or a gun barrel, women being tied up or chained or wearing a dog collar, women hanging from a tree, or upside down, naked, legs spread wide, women being raped, beaten, killed.</t2750> <t2751>Once we had to watch a woman being cut into pieces, slowly, fingers and nipples being neatly sliced off, her belly being slit open and her intestines pulled out.</t2751>
<t2752>Just look at the road over there, Aunt Lydia said.</t2752> <t2753>You see how it was before, right?</t2753> <t2754>That's how they treated women, back then.</t2754> <t2755>Her voice trembled with indignation.</t2755>
<t2756>Moira said that it wasn't a real scene, it was all mannequins; but it was hard to tell the difference.</t2756>
<t2757>But sometimes they also showed what Aunt Lydia called documentaries about the Unwomen.</t2757> <t2758>Imagine, Aunt Lydia said, wasting time like that, when they could have been doing something useful.</t2758> <t2759>Back then, the Unwomen wasted time all day long.</t2759> <t2760>They were encouraged to do so.</t2760> <t2761>The government paid them to do it.</t2761> <t2762>Don't forget, many of their ideas were quite solid, she continued, with the authoritative and smug tone of someone in a position to judge.</t2762> <t2763>We will have to accommodate some of those ideas, even now.</t2763> <t2764>Just a few, she said coyly, raising her index finger to admonish us.</t2764> <t2765>But they were godless, and that makes them very different, don't you agree?</t2765>
<t2766>I sit on the mat, hands folded, and Aunt Lydia stands aside, away from the screen, lights off, and I wonder if I could, in the darkness, lean to the right without anyone noticing, and whisper to the person next to me.</t2766> <t2767>What would I say? I would ask, Have you seen Moira?</t2767> <t2768>Because no one has seen her, she didn't come down for breakfast.</t2768> <t2769>But even though the room is dim, it's not completely dark, so I switch to a waiting stance, which can easily be mistaken for attentiveness. The sound is completely off, in these kinds of films, though they leave it on for pornographic ones.</t2769> <t2770>We need to hear the screams, the panting or the shrieking, considered to be from extreme pain or extreme pleasure or both at the same time, but they never let us hear what the Unwomen say.</t2770>
<t2771>First, the title appeared with a few names, on the negative film that had been blacked out with wax so we wouldn't read them, then I saw my mother.</t2771> <t2772>My young mother, younger than I even remember, as young as she must have been before I was born.</t2772> <t2773>She was dressed as Aunt Lydia said was typical of Unwomen of that time, wearing overalls over a half-blue, half-lavender checkered shirt, and sneakers; just like Moira used to wear, just like I remember wearing myself, a long time ago.</t2773> <t2774>Her hair was tied back with a lavender scarf.</t2774> <t2775>Her face was very young, very serious, even beautiful.</t2775> <t2776>I had forgotten that my mother was once so beautiful and earnest.</t2776> <t2777>She stood among a group of women, dressed in the same style: she was holding up a stick, no, it was a banner, that was the handle.</t2777> <t2778>The frame panned up and we saw the words, painted, on what must have been a bedsheet: TAKE BACK THE NIGHT. This was not blacked out, even though we were not allowed to read written words.</t2778> <t2779>Everyone around me gasped, the whole room stirred, like wind through grass.</t2779> <t2780>Was this due to negligence, had we glimpsed something we shouldn't have seen?</t2780> <t2781>Or was it intentional, to remind us of the absolutely unsafe days of the past?</t2781>
<t2782>After this sign, there are many other banners, the frame glides past: THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF CHOICE. EVERY CHILD IS BORN FROM A DESIRE. RECLAIM YOUR BODY. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE KITCHEN? Below the last banner, there is a sketch of a woman's body, lying on a table, blood dripping down.</t2782>
<t2783>Now my mother is moving forward, she is smiling, laughing loudly, they are all moving forward, and now all are raising their fists to the sky.</t2783> <t2784>The frame glides up to the sky, where hundreds of balloons are flying up, trailing long strings: red balloons, with circles drawn on them, circles with stems like apple stems, and crosses.</t2784> <t2785>Back on the ground, my mother has blended into the crowd, I can't see her anywhere.</t2785>
<t2786>My mother gave birth to me in thirty-seven, my mother said.</t2786> <t2787>It was really risky, I could have been deformed or something like that.</t2787> <t2788>I was born out of desire, that's good, and my mother was cursed by a bunch of people! Tricia, my mother's closest friend, cursed my mother as a reproductive freak, that bitch.</t2788> <t2789>Just jealousy, my mother thought so.</t2789> <t2790>But some others were quite comfortable.</t2790> <t2791>But when my mother was six months pregnant, countless people started sending all kinds of articles about the skyrocketing rate of birth defects after thirty-five.</t2791> <t2792>So helpful.</t2792> <t2793>And the crap about the challenges facing single mothers.</t2793> <t2794>Throw it all away, my mother said, I have started and I will see it through.</t2794> <t2795>At the hospital, they wrote on the chart "Elderly primigravida," caught red-handed by my mother.</t2795> <t2796>That's a fancy term for someone having their first child after thirty, after thirty, for God's sake.</t2796> <t2797>Damn it, my mother told them, biologically I’m only twenty-two, and if you like, I can kick your asses anytime.</t2797> <t2798>I will give birth to triplets and walk out of here while you are still struggling to get out of bed, just watch.</t2798>
<t2799>When she mentioned that, Mom tilted her chin up.</t2799><t2800>I still remember Mom back then, chin tilted up, a glass of wine in front of her on the kitchen table; not youthful, sincere, and beautiful like in the movies, but sinewy, tough, just like the old ladies in the supermarket who would never let anyone cut in line.</t2800><t2801>Mom liked to drop by my house for a drink while Luke and I were preparing dinner, and tell us where her life went wrong, and it always ended up with her pointing out where we went wrong.</t2801><t2802>Mom's hair was gray by then, of course.</t2802><t2803>She didn't plan to dye it.</t2803><t2804>What's the point of pretending, that was her opinion.</t2804><t2805>Anyway, what else did she need to do, she didn't want men bustling around her anymore, what good were they besides spending ten seconds to make half a baby.</t2805><t2806>Men are just a tactic women use to produce more women.</t2806><t2807>She didn't say your father wasn't pleasant or anything, but he wasn't fit to be a father.</t2807><t2808>And she didn't expect anything either.</t2808><t2809>Do the necessary thing, then get lost, she said, I earn enough, I can afford daycare.</t2809><t2810>So he went to the seaside and sent a card at Christmas.</t2810><t2811>Actually, he had quite beautiful blue eyes.</t2811><t2812>But they still lack something, even the best ones.</t2812><t2813>It's like they're perpetually absent-minded, like they never remember who they are.</t2813><t2814>They look up at the clouds for too long.</t2814><t2815>They don't feel their feet on the ground.</t2815><t2816>They're not even a fraction of a woman except for being a bit better at fixing cars and playing ball, which is so necessary for improving the species, right?</t2816>
<t2817>That's how mother's tongue is, even in front of Luke. He didn't mind, and would tease her back by pretending to be a hero, saying that women couldn't think abstractly, and then she would pour another glass and laugh at him.</t2817>
<t2818>The pig is so dirty, mom will say.</t2818>
<t2819>Mom is crazy too, Luke would tell me that, and she would put on a mischievous, even sly look.</t2819>
<t2820>I have the right, mother would say.</t2820> <t2821>I am old now, my duties are done, now it's time to go crazy.</t2821> <t2822>You all are still wet behind the ears.</t2822> <t2823>Suckling pigs, that's right.</t2823>
<t2824>And you too, my mother turned to me, truly a backward progression.</t2824> <t2825>An elephant's head, a mouse's tail.</t2825> <t2826>History will absolve me.</t2826>
<t2827>But mom will only speak in that tone after the third glass.</t2827>
<t2828>You young people don't appreciate anything, mother will say.</t2828> <t2829>You don't know what we had to go through to get this day for you.</t2829> <t2830>Just look at that man slicing carrots over there.</t2830> <t2831>Do you know how many women lost their lives, crushed under the wheels of tanks, to reach that point?</t2831>
<t2832>Cooking is my hobby, Luke would reply.</t2832> <t2833>I like doing it.</t2833>
<t2834>My mother's response to my trivial hobbies.</t2834> <t2835>Don't make excuses to me.</t2835> <t2836>In the past, you weren't even allowed to have such hobbies; you would be called a hypocrite.</t2836>
<t2837>Alright, mom, let me speak now.</t2837> <t2838>Stop arguing over trivial matters.</t2838>
<t2839>No, mother said bitterly.</t2839> <t2840>She said no.</t2840> <t2841>She doesn't understand, that's right.</t2841> <t2842>She doesn't understand anything I say.</t2842>
<t2843>Sometimes, mother will cry.</t2843> <t2844>On those days, mother is very lonely, she will say so.</t2844> <t2845>You children don't understand how lonely mother is.</t2845> <t2846>Even though mother has friends and is relatively fortunate, she is still very lonely.</t2846>
<t2847>There are many times I admire my mother, even though our relationship has never been simple.</t2847> <t2848>My mother demands too much from me, I think.</t2848> <t2849>She demands that I be a witness to justify her life, her decisions.</t2849> <t2850>I don't want to live my life according to the standards she sets.</t2850> <t2851>I don't want to be the model child, embodying her ideals.</t2851> <t2852>We often argue loudly about this.</t2852> <t2853>You don't live so that I have a reason to exist, I once said.</t2853>
<t2854>I want to have my mother back.</t2854> <t2855>I want to have everything back, like it was before.</t2855> <t2856>But nothing comes of it, that desire.</t2856>
<t2857>21</t2857>
<t2858>It's hot here, and also too noisy.</t2858> <t2859>The voices of the women rise around me, the soft chanting still deafening after days of silence.</t2859> <t2860>In the corner of the room, there's a blood-stained sheet, rolled up and thrown there since the water broke.</t2860> <t2861>Earlier, I didn't notice it.</t2861>
<t2862>The room also had a smell, the air was stuffy, they should have opened the door.</t2862> <t2863>The mixed smell of our flesh, an organic smell, sweat with a hint of iron, from the blood on the sheet, and another smell, more animalistic, emanating directly from Janine: the smell of a den, the smell of inhabited caves, the smell of the checkered blanket on the bed when the cat gave birth there, the only time, before being spayed.</t2863> <t2864>The smell of the womb.</t2864>
<t2865>“Inhale, inhale,” we chanted softly, as we had learned, “Hold the breath, hold the breath.</t2865> <t2866>Exhale, exhale, exhale.” We recited in a rhythm of five.</t2866> <t2867>In for five, hold for five, exhale for five.</t2867> <t2868>Janine, eyes tightly shut, tried to control her breathing. Aunt Elizabeth checked the dilation of her cervix.</t2868>
<t2869>Now Janine felt restless, she wanted to walk around.</t2869> <t2870>Two women helped her up from the bed, supporting her on both sides as she took each step.</t2870> <t2871>A muscle contraction came, and she bent over, collapsing.</t2871> <t2872>One of the two women knelt down and stroked her back.</t2872> <t2873>Everyone was good at this, having practiced repeatedly.</t2873> <t2874>I recognized Ofglen, my shopping partner, sitting two people away from me.</t2874> <t2875>The soft chanting surrounded us like a veil.</t2875>
<t2876>A woman named Martha came, carrying a tray: a jug of fruit juice, made from powder, probably grape, and a stack of paper cups.</t2876> <t2877>She placed it on the carpet in front of the row of murmuring women.</t2877> <t2878>Ofglen, without a moment's delay, poured it out, and the paper cups were passed down the line.</t2878>
<t2879>I received a glass, leaned over to pass it on, and the person sitting next to me whispered in my ear, "Are you looking for someone?"</t2879>
<t2880>“Moira,” I said, just as softly. “Black hair, with freckles.</t2880><t2881>”</t2881>
<t2882>"I don't know," the other person said.</t2882> <t2883>I don't know you, you are not at the Center, although I have seen you before, while shopping.</t2883> <t2884>"But I will keep an eye out for you."</t2884>
<t2885>"Really?" I said.</t2885>
<t2886>“Alma,” she said.</t2886> <t2887>“What is your real name?”</t2887>
<t2888>I wanted to tell her that there was also an Alma at the Center with me.</t2888> <t2889>I wanted to say my name, but Aunt Elizabeth had already looked up, scrutinizing the room, she must have heard the interrupted murmur, it was too late.</t2889> <t2890>Sometimes you can find out something during Birthdays. But asking about Luke would be pointless.</t2890> <t2891>He can't be anywhere the women might encounter him.</t2891>
<t2892>The murmuring continued, it had started to infect me.</t2892> <t2893>This task was quite arduous, requiring concentration.</t2893> <t2894>Be one with your body, Aunt Elizabeth said.</t2894> <t2895>Right now, I could feel a slight pain in my stomach, and a tightness in my chest.</t2895> <t2896>Janine screamed, her voice very faint, half scream, half moan.</t2896>
<t2897>“She has entered the transition phase,” Aunt Elizabeth said.</t2897>
<t2898>One of the two caregivers took a damp cloth and wiped Janine's forehead.</t2898> <t2899>Janine was sweating profusely, with strands of hair slipping out of her ponytail, many sticking to her forehead and neck.</t2899> <t2900>Her skin was damp, soaked, and glistening.</t2900>
<t2901>"Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!" we murmured.</t2901>
<t2902>“I want to go outside,” Janine panted.</t2902> <t2903>“I want to take a walk.</t2903> <t2904>I'm fine.</t2904> <t2905>I need to go to the bathroom.”</t2905>
<t2906>We all understand that she is at a transitional stage, she doesn't know what she is doing.</t2906> <t2907>Which sentence is correct? Surely the last one.</t2907> <t2908>Aunt Elizabeth signaled, and the two women standing by the portable toilet gently placed Janine on it.</t2908> <t2909>Another smell, adding to the ones already present in the room.</t2909> <t2910>Janine groaned again, her head drooping so that we could only see her hair.</t2910> <t2911>Her body folded, she looked like a doll, robbed and discarded, in a corner, her arms bent at her sides.</t2911>
<t2912>Janine got up again and walked around.</t2912> <t2913>“I want to sit down,” she said.</t2913> <t2914>How long have we been here? Minutes, hours.</t2914> <t2915>Now I am also sweating, my armpits are soaked, my upper lip tastes salty, the false labor pains grip me, and the others too, you can tell by the way they sway.</t2915> <t2916>Janine is sucking noisily on a piece of ice.</t2916> <t2917>Then, a few steps or a few miles later, “No,” she screamed.</t2917> <t2918>“Oh no, no, oh no no.” This is her second child, she had another one, a long time ago, I knew back at the Center, she used to cry every night because she missed it, just like all of us, only louder.</t2918> <t2919>So she must remember this, remember what it was like, remember what’s coming.</t2919> <t2920>But who can remember pain, once it’s over?</t2920> <t2921>All that remains is a shadow, not even in the mind, but in the flesh.</t2921> <t2922>Pain leaves a mark, but too deep to see.</t2922> <t2923>Out of sight, out of mind.</t2923>
<t2924>Someone has mixed wine into the grape juice.</t2924> <t2925>Someone has stolen a bottle from downstairs.</t2925> <t2926>It's not the first time in gatherings like these, but they will turn a blind eye.</t2926> <t2927>We also need to revel, don't we?</t2927>
<t2928>"Dim the lights," Aunt Elizabeth said.</t2928> <t2929>"Tell her it's time."</t2929>
<t2930>Someone stood up, went to the wall, the light in the room dimmed to a mere glimmer, our voices lowered into a creaky, hoarse whispering chorus, like crickets in the dark field.</t2930> <t2931>Two people left the room, two others took Janine to the Birthing Stool, to sit her on the low platform.</t2931> <t2932>Now she had calmed down, the air entering her lungs more evenly, we leaned towards her, tense, our back and abdominal muscles straining painfully.</t2932> <t2933>It was coming, it was coming, like a battle horn, calling for combat, like a collapsing wall, we could feel it as a heavy stone moving down, being dragged down inside us, we thought we were about to explode.</t2933> <t2934>We clung to each other's hands, we were no longer individuals.</t2934>
<t2935>The Commander's Wife hurried in, still in her strange white nightgown, with her skinny legs sticking out underneath.</t2935> <t2936>Two other Wives, in blue robes, supported her arms, as if she needed it; on her face was a tense smile, like the hostess of a party reluctantly organized.</t2936> <t2937>She must have known what we thought of her.</t2937> <t2938>She struggled to climb onto the Birthing Stool, sitting on the upper backrest above Janine, enveloping her: her thin legs dangling down, like the armrests of an unusual armchair.</t2938> <t2939>Strangely, she wore white cotton socks and blue fuzzy slippers, like toilet seat covers.</t2939> <t2940>But we paid no attention to the Wife, almost not even seeing her, our eyes fixed on Janine.</t2940> <t2941>In the dim light, wearing white, she glowed like the moon amidst a halo of clouds.</t2941>
<t2942>Now she is wheezing, making every effort.</t2942> <t2943>“Push, push, push,” we whispered.</t2943> <t2944>“Relax.</t2944> <t2945>Breathe hard.</t2945> <t2946>Push, push, push.” We were with her, we were also her, we were dizzy with excitement.</t2946> <t2947>Aunt Elizabeth knelt, holding the wide sheet ready to catch the baby, here came the crown, the halo, the head, purple and smeared with cream, one more push and it slipped out swiftly in water and blood, straight into our waiting arms.</t2947> <t2948>Blessings.</t2948>
<t2949>We held our breath watching Aunt Elizabeth examine her: the girl, poor thing, but for now she was fine, at least nothing was broken, within visible range, arms, legs, eyes, we silently counted, everything in its place.</t2949> <t2950>Aunt Elizabeth, holding the child, looked up at us and smiled.</t2950> <t2951>We also smiled, we shared a common smile, tears rolling down our faces, we were so happy.</t2951>
<t2952>In that joy, there is a part of memory.</t2952> <t2953>I remember remembering Luke, beside me in the hospital, standing at the head of the bed, holding my hand tightly, wearing a blue gown and a white mask provided.</t2953> <t2954>Oh, he said, oh Jesus, his breath exhaled in admiration.</t2954> <t2955>That night he couldn't sleep at all, he said, too excited.</t2955>
<t2956>Aunt Elizabeth is gently bathing the baby clean, it doesn't cry much, it's quiet now.</t2956> <t2957>Very softly, to avoid startling it, we stood up, gathered around Janine, hugged her, and comforted her.</t2957> <t2958>She was crying too.</t2958> <t2959>The two blue-clad Wives helped the third Wife, the house's mistress, down from the Birthing Stool to the bed, laid her down, and tucked her in.</t2959> <t2960>The baby, clean and silent, was solemnly placed into her hands.</t2960> <t2961>The Wives downstairs were now pouring in, jostling past us, pushing us aside.</t2961> <t2962>They were so noisy, some carrying plates, cups of coffee, glasses of wine, some still chewing, they crowded around the bed, mother and child, cooing and congratulating.</t2962> <t2963>Jealousy emanated from them, I could smell it, a faint acidic scent mixed with perfume.</t2963> <t2964>The Commander’s Wife looked down at the baby as if looking at a bouquet: something she had won, a tribute.</t2964>
<t2965>The Ladies came here to witness the naming ceremony.</t2965> <t2966>The naming is the duty of the Lady in this region.</t2966>
<t2967>“Angela,” the General's wife announced.</t2967>
<t2968>“Angela, Angela,” the ladies repeated, chirping.</t2968> <t2969>“Such a lovely name! The girl is truly perfect! The girl is absolutely wonderful!”</t2969>
<t2970>I stood blocking Janine from the bed, so she wouldn't have to witness that scene.</t2970> <t2971>Someone gave her a sip of grape juice, I hope it was mixed with wine, she was still convulsing, pushing out the placenta, she was crying helplessly, with those damn burning tears.</t2971> <t2972>But despite everything, we rejoiced, this was a victory for all of us.</t2972> <t2973>We had done it.</t2973>
<t2974>She will be allowed to take care of the baby, and in the first few months, they encourage the use of breast milk.</t2974> <t2975>After that, she will be given a trip to see if she can do it again, with someone else who needs a turn.</t2975> <t2976>But she will never be sent to the Colonies, nor be declared an Unwoman.</t2976> <t2977>A reward for her.</t2977>
<t2978>The Transport vehicle is waiting outside, taking us back to each of our homes.</t2978> <t2979>The doctors are still in their car; their faces appear at the window, pale patches, like sick children's faces trapped indoors.</t2979> <t2980>One person opens the car door towards us.</t2980>
<t2981>"Is everything okay?" he asked, worried.</t2981>
<t2982>"It's all right," I said.</t2982> <t2983>By now, I was exhausted, completely worn out.</t2983> <t2984>My chest ached, it was leaking.</t2984> <t2985>Fake milk, some of us would experience this.</t2985> <t2986>We sat on the bench, facing each other, on the way back; now we were devoid of all emotions, almost all sensations, just bundles of red cloth.</t2986> <t2987>We were in pain.</t2987> <t2988>Each of us cradled a ghost, a phantom baby.</t2988> <t2989>Facing us, when the excitement had passed, was our own failure.</t2989> <t2990>Mother, I thought.</t2990> <t2991>Wherever you are.</t2991> <t2992>Can you hear me?</t2992> <t2993>You wanted a culture of women.</t2993> <t2994>Now there is one.</t2994> <t2995>Not exactly as you imagined, but it exists.</t2995> <t2996>Be grateful for small blessings.</t2996>
<t2997>22</t2997>
<t2998>By the time Van's car stopped in front of the house, it was late afternoon.</t2998> <t2999>The weak sun shone through the clouds, and the smell of wet grass warmed in the air.</t2999> <t3000>I had attended the Sinh event all day; it felt like time had completely disappeared.</t3000> <t3001>Today, Cora had probably finished shopping, and I was free from all duties.</t3001> <t3002>I went upstairs, my legs heavy as I lifted them from one step to the next, gripping the handrail tightly.</t3002> <t3003>I felt as if I had been awake for many days and had run a lot; my chest hurt, and my muscles contracted as if lacking sugar.</t3003> <t3004>For once, I welcomed the solitude.</t3004>
<t3005>I lay down on the bed.</t3005> <t3006>I wanted to rest, to sleep, but I was too tired and too agitated to close my eyes.</t3006> <t3007>I looked up at the ceiling, tracing the edges of the wreath.</t3007> <t3008>Today, I saw it again as a hat, the kind of wide-brimmed hat that women used to wear in a bygone era: a hat like a giant halo, adorned with flowers, fruits, and feathers of tropical birds; a hat like a sketch of paradise, floating right above the head, a concept materialized.</t3008>
<t3009>In just a moment, the wreath will start to change color and I will see illusions.</t3009> <t3010>I am that tired: as if I had been driving all night, until dawn, for some reason, which I will not think about now, helping each other stay awake by telling stories and taking turns driving, and when the sun begins to rise, we will see all sorts of things in the corner of our eyes: purple animals in the bushes by the road, vague human shapes that will disappear if you look directly at them.</t3010>
<t3011>I am too tired to continue this story.</t3011> <t3012>I am too tired to even think about where I am.</t3012> <t3013>Well, here is a different story, a better one.</t3013> <t3014>A story about what happened to Moira.</t3014>
<t3015>Part of it I figured out myself, another part I heard from Alma, Alma heard from Dolores, Dolores heard from Janine.</t3015> <t3016>Janine heard from Aunt Lydia.</t3016> <t3017>There are alliances even in those places, even in those circumstances.</t3017> <t3018>That is one thing you can always believe: there are alliances everywhere, of whatever kind.</t3018>
<t3019>Aunt Lydia called Janine into the office.</t3019>
<t3020>Bless the fruit, Janine, Aunt Lydia must have said that, without looking up, still scribbling.</t3020> <t3021>Every rule has an exception: another thing you can always believe.</t3021> <t3022>The aunts are allowed to read and write.</t3022>
<t3023>Janine probably answered, without any inflection, in her typical clear, raw egg white voice.</t3023>
<t3024>I feel like I can rely on you, Janine, Aunt Lydia must have said, when she finally took her eyes off the page and fixed them on Janine, through her glasses, with that characteristic look that was both threatening and pleading at the same time.</t3024> <t3025>Help me, that look said, we're in this together.</t3025> <t3026>You can be relied upon, she continued, unlike many of them.</t3026>
<t3027>Let all of Janine's sobbing and repentance have meaning, let Janine have converted, let Janine be a true believer.</t3027> <t3028>But by then, Janine had become a puppy kicked too many times, by anyone who felt like it: she would roll over for anyone who wanted to scratch her belly, would blurt out anything, as long as it earned her a moment of praise.</t3028>
<t3029>So Janine must have said: I hope so, Aunt Lydia.</t3029> <t3030>I hope I have lived up to your trust.</t3030> <t3031>Or something like that.</t3031>
<t3032>Janine, Aunt Lydia said, something terrible has happened.</t3032>
<t3033>Janine looked down at the floor.</t3033> <t3034>Whatever it was, she knew she wasn't guilty, she was completely innocent.</t3034> <t3035>But being innocent hadn't helped before, had it? So at the same time, she felt guilty, felt like she was about to be punished.</t3035>
<t3036>Do you know what happened, Janine? Aunt Lydia gently asked.</t3036>
<t3037>No, Aunt, Janine said.</t3037> <t3038>She knew that by this time she needed to look up, directly into Aunt Lydia's eyes.</t3038> <t3039>After a second, she managed to do it.</t3039>
<t3040>Because if I do, I will be extremely disappointed in you, Aunt Lydia said.</t3040>
<t3041>God as my witness, Janine said with utmost fervor.</t3041>
<t3042>Aunt Lydia allowed herself to enjoy another moment of silence.</t3042> <t3043>She fiddled with the pen.</t3043> <t3044>Moira is no longer with us, she finally said.</t3044>
<t3045>"Ah," Janine said.</t3045> <t3046>She didn't feel anything.</t3046> <t3047>Moira wasn't one of her friends.</t3047> <t3048>"Is she dead?" she asked after a moment.</t3048>
<t3049>Then Aunt Lydia told that story.</t3049> <t3050>Moira raised her hand to ask to go to the bathroom during Physical Education class.</t3050> <t3051>She went. Aunt Elizabeth was on bathroom duty.</t3051> <t3052>Aunt Elizabeth waited outside the door, as usual; Moira went in.</t3052> <t3053>A moment later, Moira called Aunt Elizabeth: the toilet was overflowing, could Aunt Elizabeth come in to fix it?</t3053> <t3054>Indeed, the toilet occasionally overflowed.</t3054> <t3055>The hidden troublemakers had stuffed large amounts of toilet paper into it, precisely to cause this.</t3055> <t3056>The Aunts were studying a reliable way to prevent it, but the budget was limited and for now, they had to make do with what they had, without figuring out how to lock the paper supply.</t3056> <t3057>Perhaps they should place it outside on a table, giving each person only one or a few sheets as they went in.</t3057> <t3058>But that was for later.</t3058> <t3059>It also took time to smooth out the wrinkles on the new items.</t3059>
<t3060>Aunt Elizabeth, not sensing any danger, went into the bathroom.</t3060> <t3061>Aunt Lydia had to admit that doing so was a bit foolish.</t3061> <t3062>On the other hand, she had fixed the toilet many times without any incident.</t3062>
<t3063>Moira wasn't lying, the water was flooding the floor, and there were a few pieces of solid waste decomposing as well.</t3063> <t3064>It wasn't pleasant, and Aunt Elizabeth was extremely annoyed.</t3064> <t3065>Moira politely stepped aside, and Aunt hurried into the compartment Moira had pointed out and bent down to look into the water tank.</t3065> <t3066>She intended to lift the porcelain lid to check the float and the button inside.</t3066> <t3067>She was holding the lid with both hands when she felt a sharp, probably metallic object poke into her back near the ribs.</t3067> <t3068>Don't move, Moira said, or I'll stab it all the way in, I know where, I'll poke a hole in your lung.</t3068> <t3069>Later, they discovered she had dismantled a tank to get the long, sharp handle that connects the flush valve to the chain holding the button.</t3069> <t3070>It wasn't difficult if you knew how to do it, and Moira was mechanically inclined; she used to fix her car herself when it had minor issues.</t3070> <t3071>Right after that incident, the toilet tanks were chained to secure the lids, and every time there was a flood, it took a very long time to open them.</t3071> <t3072>That's how we had a few floods.</t3072>
<t3073>Aunt Elizabeth couldn't see what was poking her back, Aunt Lydia said.</t3073> <t3074>She is a brave woman..</t3074><t3075>.</t3075>
<t3076>That's absolutely right, Janine said.</t3076>
<t3077>... but not recklessly, Aunt Lydia said, slightly frowning.</t3077> <t3078>Janine was overly enthusiastic, and that sometimes amounted to denial.</t3078> <t3079>She followed Moira's instructions, Aunt Lydia continued.</t3079> <t3080>Moira got a cattle prod and a whistle, which she had to remove from her belt by order.</t3080> <t3081>Then she drove Aunt Elizabeth down the stairs to the basement.</t3081> <t3082>They were on the second floor, not the third, so they only had to go down two flights of stairs.</t3082> <t3083>Classes were in session, so the hallway was empty.</t3083> <t3084>They did encounter another Aunt, but she was at the far end of the hallway and wasn't looking their way.</t3084> <t3085>At this point, Aunt Elizabeth could have screamed, but she knew Moira meant what she said; Moira had a bad reputation.</t3085>
<t3086>That's absolutely right, Janine said.</t3086>
<t3087>Moira pushed Aunt Elizabeth down the hallway past the rows of empty lockers, past the gymnasium, into the furnace room.</t3087> <t3088>She made Aunt Elizabeth take off all her clothes...</t3088>
<t3089>Oh, Janine said weakly, as if expressing protest against the blasphemous act.</t3089>
<t3090>... and Moira also took off all her clothes and put on Aunt Elizabeth's clothes, which didn't fit perfectly but were good enough.</t3090> <t3091>She wasn't too malicious; she also allowed the aunt to wear her red clothes.</t3091> <t3092>She tore the veil into strips and tied the aunt up, behind the stove.</t3092> <t3093>She stuffed some pieces into the aunt's mouth and tied it with another strip.</t3093> <t3094>She tied one strip around the aunt's neck and the other end to her legs, behind.</t3094> <t3095>She was truly a cunning and dangerous woman, Aunt Lydia said.</t3095>
<t3096>Janine said, "May I sit down?" as if she had reached her limit.</t3096> <t3097>Finally, she had something to trade, at least to get one vote.</t3097>
<t3098>Alright, Janine, Aunt Lydia said, slightly surprised, but knowing that at this point she couldn't refuse.</t3098> <t3099>She needed Janine to focus, needed her cooperation.</t3099> <t3100>She pointed to the chair in the corner of the room.</t3100> <t3101>Janine pulled back.</t3101>
<t3102>I could have killed you, you know, Moira said, when Aunt Elizabeth was safely out of sight behind the stove.</t3102> <t3103>I could have injured you so badly that your body would never be whole again.</t3103> <t3104>I could have stabbed you, or poked this into your eye.</t3104> <t3105>But remember that I didn't, if it ever comes to that.</t3105>
<t3106>Aunt Lydia did not repeat any of it to Janine, but I guess Moira said something similar.</t3106> <t3107>Anyway, she did not kill or mutilate Aunt Elizabeth, and a few days later, having recovered after seven hours of being pressed against the stove, and possibly after an interrogation as well - the possibility of collusion cannot be ruled out, whether by the aunts or anyone else - she was seen back at her duties at the Center.</t3107>
<t3108>Moira stood up straight, her eyes resolutely looking forward.</t3108> <t3109>She squared her shoulders, straightened her back, and pressed her lips together.</t3109> <t3110>It was not our usual posture.</t3110> <t3111>On normal days, we walked with our heads bowed, looking at our hands or just at the ground.</t3111> <t3112>Moira didn't look much like Aunt Elizabeth, even though she was wearing the brown veil, but that straight-backed posture clearly convinced the Angels standing guard, who had never really looked closely at any of us, especially, or rather most of all, the Aunts; because Moira boldly walked straight to the main door, with the demeanor of someone who knew exactly where she was going; she received their nods, presented Aunt Elizabeth's pass, which they didn't even bother to check, because who would dare be disrespectful to the Aunts like that.</t3112> <t3113>And she disappeared.</t3113>
<t3114>Oh, Janine said.</t3114> <t3115>Who knows what she feels?</t3115> <t3116>Maybe she wants to cheer.</t3116> <t3117>If so, she hides it too well.</t3117>
<t3118>That's it, Janine, Aunt Lydia said.</t3118> <t3119>I want to ask you to do this.</t3119>
<t3120>Janine opened her eyes wide, trying to appear innocent and attentive.</t3120>
<t3121>I want you to wear the headphones.</t3121> <t3122>There might be someone else involved.</t3122>
<t3123>Yes, Aunt Lydia, Janine said.</t3123>
<t3124>Then come and let me know, okay, little girl?</t3124> <t3125>If you hear anything?</t3125>
<t3126>Yes, Aunt Lydia, Janine said.</t3126> <t3127>She knew she would no longer have to kneel down, in front of the whole class, listening to all of us scream in her face that it was her fault.</t3127> <t3128>Soon, it would be someone else.</t3128> <t3129>For the time being, she escaped the fate of being hung out to dry.</t3129>
<t3130>It doesn't mean anything if she tells Dolores everything about this meeting.</t3130> <t3131>It doesn't mean she won't testify against us, any of us, whenever she gets the chance.</t3131> <t3132>We understand.</t3132> <t3133>Until now, we have treated her like people used to treat legless individuals selling pencils on the street corner.</t3133> <t3134>Avoid as much as possible, compassionate when unavoidable.</t3134> <t3135>She is a threat to everyone, we know.</t3135>
<t3136>Dolores must have praised her, saying that telling it like that was very good.</t3136> <t3137>Where did this conversation take place? In the gymnasium, when getting ready for bed.</t3137> <t3138>Dolores lay in the bed right next to Janine.</t3138>
<t3139>The story was passed among us that night, in the twilight, in soft breaths, from one bed to another.</t3139>
<t3140>Moira is somewhere out there.</t3140> <t3141>Free, or already dead.</t3141> <t3142>What does she intend to do? The thought of what she intends to do keeps expanding, until it fills the entire room.</t3142> <t3143>At any moment, there could be a loud explosion, glass shattering inward, the main doors bursting open...</t3143> <t3144>Now Moira has power, she has been released, she has freed herself.</t3144> <t3145>She is now a liberated woman.</t3145>
<t3146>I think at that moment we felt terrified.</t3146>
<t3147>Moira is like an elevator shaft without walls.</t3147> <t3148>She makes us dizzy.</t3148> <t3149>By now, we have already lost our desire for freedom, finding security within four walls.</t3149> <t3150>The high atmospheric layers would make people disappear, evaporate, without enough pressure to keep them intact.</t3150>
<t3151>But Moira was still our dream.</t3151> <t3152>We embraced her, she was still here in secret, like a crisp laugh; she was the lava beneath the surface of everyday life.</t3152>
<t3153>With Moira illuminating them, the aunts became less frightening and more ridiculous.</t3153> <t3154>Their power also had flaws.</t3154> <t3155>They could be intimidated in the bathroom.</t3155> <t3156>That brazenness delighted us.</t3156>
<t3157>We are waiting for her to be dragged back at any moment, just like last time.</t3157> <t3158>We can't imagine what they might do to her this time.</t3158> <t3159>Whatever it is, it will surely be very bad.</t3159>
<t3160>But there was nothing.</t3160> <t3161>Moira did not reappear.</t3161> <t3162>Not yet, anyway.</t3162>
<t3163>23</t3163>
<t3164>This is a reconstruction.</t3164> <t3165>Everything is a reconstruction.</t3165> <t3166>It is a reconstruction right now, in my head, lying flat on the bed, reviewing over and over again the things that should have been said or shouldn't have been said, should have been done or shouldn't have been done, should have been handled in such and such a way.</t3166> <t3167>If I ever get out of here...</t3167>
<t3168>Stop it right now.</t3168> <t3169>I'm going to get out of here.</t3169> <t3170>It can't be like this forever.</t3170> <t3171>There were people who thought so, in the dark times before this era, and they were always right, they somehow escaped, and things weren't like that forever.</t3171> <t3172>Though for them, it might have been like that for the entirety of their forever.</t3172>
<t3173>When I have left this place, if I ever record today, in any form, even if it is words conveyed through speech, it will still be a reconstruction, distanced by another layer.</t3173> <t3174>One can never say something exactly as it was, because what is spoken can never be precise; one always has to omit something, there are too many parts, many facets, many counterpoints, many nuances; too many gestures that can be interpreted in various ways, too many shapes that can never be fully described, too many smells in the air, or tastes on the tip of the tongue, too many tones, too many.</t3174>
<t3175>But if by chance you are a man, at some point in the future, and you have followed this far, please remember: you will never have to endure the temptation, or the feeling, that you need to forgive a man, as a woman.</t3175> <t3176>It's very hard to resist, just trust me.</t3176> <t3177>But also remember that forgiveness, in itself, is power.</t3177> <t3178>Pleading for it is power, and refusing or granting it is also power, perhaps the greatest power.</t3178>
<t3179>Maybe the issue has nothing to do with ownership.</t3179> <t3180>Maybe it's not necessarily about who possesses whom, who can do what to whom and still get away with it, until death.</t3180> <t3181>Maybe it's not about who gets to sit and who has to kneel or stand or lie on their back, legs spread apart.</t3181> <t3182>Perhaps it's about who can do what to whom and still be forgiven.</t3182> <t3183>Don't tell me it's all the same.</t3183>
<t3184>I want you to kiss me, the Commander said.</t3184>
<t3185>Oh, of course, there was more before that.</t3185> <t3186>Such demands don't just fall from the sky.</t3186>
<t3187>Finally, I fell asleep and dreamed that I was wearing earrings, one of which was broken; it had no special meaning, just the brain revisiting old memories, and I woke up when Cora brought in my food tray, and the sense of time returned.</t3187>
<t3188>“Is the baby doing well?” Cora asked as she put down the tray.</t3188> <t3189>Surely she already knew, they had a kind of oral telegraph, from one household to another, spreading news everywhere; but she still enjoyed hearing it again, as if my words would make it more real.</t3189>
<t3190>“Not bad,” I said. “A treasure.</t3190> <t3191>A daughter.”</t3191>
<t3192>Cora smiled at me, a smile full of meaning.</t3192> <t3193>This was one of those moments that made her cherish what she did.</t3193>
<t3194>“Wonderful,” she said.</t3194> <t3195>Her voice was almost wistful, and I thought: of course.</t3195> <t3196>She must have really wanted to go there too.</t3196> <t3197>Like a party she couldn't attend.</t3197>
<t3198>“Maybe our house will have it, soon,” she said shyly.</t3198> <t3199>Our house means me.</t3199> <t3200>I have the duty to repay the whole group, worthy of the care and accommodation, like a queen ant holding eggs.</t3200> <t3201>Rita might not be satisfied with me, but Cora is different.</t3201> <t3202>On the contrary, she clings to me.</t3202> <t3203>She has hope, I am the means for that hope.</t3203>
<t3204>Her hopes were of the simplest kind.</t3204> <t3205>She wanted to have a Birthday, here, with guests, food, and gifts; she wanted to have a child to bring into the kitchen, to pamper, to iron clothes for, to sneak cookies to when no one was looking.</t3205> <t3206>I had the responsibility to provide her with those joys.</t3206> <t3207>I would rather endure dissatisfaction; that way, I felt more deserving.</t3207>
<t3208>Dinner includes beef stew.</t3208> <t3209>I eat with some difficulty, because halfway through I remember something that had slipped my mind during the day.</t3209> <t3210>They were right, one would fall into a trance-like state, whether giving birth or attending, causing one to lose a sense of the outside world, focusing solely on the present moment.</t3210> <t3211>But now it has returned, and I know I am not ready.</t3211>
<t3212>The clock in the hall struck nine.</t3212> <t3213>I squeezed my hands against my thighs, took a deep breath, walked out to the hallway, and stepped lightly down the stairs.</t3213> <t3214>Serena Joy was probably still at the house where the Birth ceremony had taken place; it was just a stroke of luck, he couldn't have predicted that.</t3214> <t3215>On these occasions, the Wives gather for hours, helping to open gifts, gossiping, and drinking to their heart's content.</t3215> <t3216>There has to be something to dissolve the jealousy.</t3216> <t3217>I followed the hall downstairs to the back, past the kitchen door, to the next door, his room.</t3217> <t3218>I stood outside, feeling like a student called to the principal's office.</t3218> <t3219>What had I done wrong?</t3219>
<t3220>I am here illegally.</t3220> <t3221>We are forbidden to be alone with the Commanders.</t3221> <t3222>We only serve the purpose of reproduction: we are not concubines, prostitutes, or mistresses.</t3222> <t3223>On the contrary, every measure has been taken to prevent that impression.</t3223> <t3224>All avenues that might allow us to bring pleasure must be eliminated, leaving no room for secret desires to take hold, no favors to be coquettishly sought, from either their side or ours, no foothold for romance.</t3224> <t3225>We are walking wombs, nothing more: sacred vessels, walking chalices.</t3225>
<t3226>So why does he want to meet me, at night, alone?</t3226>
<t3227>If I get caught, I will be handed over to the mercy of Serena Joy, who else.</t3227> <t3228>He has no right to interfere in internal discipline, that is women's business.</t3228> <t3229>After that will be reclassification.</t3229> <t3230>I could become an Unwoman.</t3230>
<t3231>But from the broom meeting the man, it could be worse.</t3231> <t3232>The real power lies with whom, that is not a question.</t3232>
<t3233>But there must be something he wants from me.</t3233> <t3234>Wanting is a weakness.</t3234> <t3235>This very weakness, whatever it is, has drawn me in.</t3235> <t3236>Like a small crack on a wall that has always been impenetrable.</t3236> <t3237>If I press my eye against it, against this weakness, I can clearly see the way through.</t3237>
<t3238>I want to know what you want.</t3238>
<t3239>I raised my hand, knocked, on the forbidden door of the room I had never been to, women never came here.</t3239> <t3240>Even Serena Joy never came here, the cleaning was all done by the Guardians.</t3240> <t3241>What secrets, what male totems were hidden in there?</t3241>
<t3242>I was let in.</t3242> <t3243>I opened the door and stepped inside.</t3243>
<t3244>On the other side of the door is normal life.</t3244> <t3245>I corrected myself: on the other side of the door looks like normal life.</t3245> <t3246>There is a desk, of course, with a computer phone, next to a leather armchair.</t3246> <t3247>There is a potted plant on the desk, a pen holder, and papers.</t3247> <t3248>On the floor is an Oriental rug, and an unlit fireplace.</t3248> <t3249>There is a small sofa, covered in brown velvet, then a TV, a small table, and a few chairs.</t3249>
<t3250>But all around are bookshelves.</t3250> <t3251>Every shelf is filled to the brim.</t3251> <t3252>Books and books and books, displayed right before our eyes, not locked, not wrapped in boxes.</t3252> <t3253>No wonder we are not allowed to come here.</t3253> <t3254>This is an oasis of forbidden things.</t3254> <t3255>I try not to look.</t3255>
<t3256>The commander was standing in front of the unlit fireplace, his back to it, one elbow resting on the intricately carved wooden mantel, the other hand in his pocket.</t3256> <t3257>His pose was meticulously arranged, evoking the style of a rural aristocrat, reminiscent of an old invitation from some glossy men's magazine.</t3257> <t3258>He had likely decided on this stance beforehand for me to see upon entering.</t3258> <t3259>When I knocked on the door, he must have rushed to the fireplace to adjust his posture.</t3259>
<t3260>He is still missing the black cloth, an eye patch, and a tie with a horseshoe pattern.</t3260>
<t3261>I can still comfortably assume that these things, fleeting and disjointed, are just a brainwave.</t3261> <t3262>It's a laugh in the mind.</t3262> <t3263>But that is actually fear.</t3263> <t3264>In reality, I am terrified.</t3264>
<t3265>I didn't say anything.</t3265>
<t3266>“Remember to close the door when you come in,” he said, quite gently.</t3266> <t3267>I closed the door, then turned back.</t3267>
<t3268>Hello, miss, he said.</t3268>
<t3269>That is the way people used to greet each other in the old days.</t3269> <t3270>I haven't heard it for a very long time, for years.</t3270> <t3271>In this context, it sounds out of place, even bizarre, like a slip back in time, a big leap somewhere.</t3271> <t3272>I couldn't think of an appropriate response.</t3272>
<t3273>I think I'm about to cry.</t3273>
<t3274>He probably realized it too, so he looked at me, puzzled, slightly furrowing his brows, which I wanted to interpret as concern, though it could just be annoyance.</t3274> <t3275>"Here," he said.</t3275> <t3276>"Have a seat." He pulled out a chair for me, placing it in front of the desk.</t3276> <t3277>Then he walked around to the back of the desk and sat down, his movements very slow and, I felt, carefully calculated.</t3277> <t3278>This action was meant to show me that he hadn't brought me here to make any advances, if it was against my will.</t3278> <t3279>He smiled.</t3279> <t3280>Not in a malicious or predatory way.</t3280> <t3281>Just a regular smile, a polite, friendly but slightly distant smile, like one would give to a cat behind a glass window.</t3281> <t3282>He was looking, but not intending to buy.</t3282>
<t3283>I sit up straight on the chair, hands placed in my lap.</t3283> <t3284>The feeling of my feet in red flat shoes as if not touching the ground.</t3284> <t3285>But of course, they are.</t3285>
<t3286>"You must find it strange," he said.</t3286>
<t3287>I just looked at him. The understatement of the year, as my mother used to say. Back in the day.</t3287>
<t3288>I thought I was cotton candy mixed with air.</t3288> <t3289>Just mold me, and I will turn into a wet, pinkish-red clump, melting away.</t3289>
<t3290>“I’m sure this is a bit strange,” he said, as I had replied.</t3290>
<t3291>I think I need a hat, tied with a bow under the chin.</t3291>
<t3292>"I want..." he said.</t3292>
<t3293>I tried not to lean forward.</t3293> <t3294>Why? Why, why?</t3294> <t3295>What is it after all? What does he want?</t3295> <t3296>But I won't reveal the excitement I'm feeling.</t3296> <t3297>This is a bargain, goods about to be exchanged.</t3297> <t3298>Anyone who hesitates is dead.</t3298> <t3299>It will be a long time before I give anything away for free: selling is possible.</t3299>
<t3300>“I hope...” he said.</t3300> <t3301>“It will sound very funny.”</t3301> <t3302>And indeed he looked embarrassed, having to use the word sheepish, as men of old once knew how to show.</t3302> <t3303>He belonged to a generation that still remembered that expression, just as they remembered how women of old were swayed by it.</t3303> <t3304>The younger ones didn't know these tricks.</t3304> <t3305>They never had to use them.</t3305>
<t3306>“I hope you will play a game of Scrabble with me,” he said.</t3306>
<t3307>I exerted my strength to keep my body rigid.</t3307> <t3308>I suppressed my facial muscles from twitching.</t3308> <t3309>Out of that room, hiding such a big secret!</t3309> <t3310>Scrabble! I wanted to laugh, to burst out laughing, to roll on the floor laughing.</t3310> <t3311>This used to be a game for old ladies and old gentlemen, in the summer or in retirement villas, when there was nothing special on TV.</t3311>
<t3312>Or for the young ones, a long, long time ago.</t3312> <t3313>My mother also had a set, stored at the bottom of the living room cabinet, next to the cardboard box containing the Christmas tree lights.</t3313> <t3314>Once, my mother tried to entice me to play, back when I was a miserable, directionless thirteen-year-old.</t3314>
<t3315>Of course, now it is different.</t3315> <t3316>Now it is a forbidden object, for us.</t3316> <t3317>Now it is a danger.</t3317> <t3318>Now it is depravity.</t3318> <t3319>Now it is something you cannot do even with your own Lady.</t3319> <t3320>Now it is an object of desire.</t3320> <t3321>Now you are putting yourself in danger.</t3321> <t3322>It's no different than you offering me drugs.</t3322>
<t3323>"Alright," I said, pretending to be indifferent.</t3323> <t3324>In fact, I could barely speak.</t3324>
<t3325>He didn't explain why he wanted to play with me.</t3325> <t3326>I didn't ask.</t3326> <t3327>He just took the box from the desk drawer and opened it.</t3327> <t3328>And there were the flexible wooden pieces I still remembered, the board divided into squares, the small shields for arranging letters.</t3328> <t3329>He poured the pieces onto the table and began flipping each one over.</t3329> <t3330>After a while, I also lent a hand.</t3330>
<t3331>“Do you know how to play?” he asked.</t3331>
<t3332>I nodded.</t3332>
<t3333>We played two games.</t3333> <t3334>Larynx, I played.</t3334> <t3335>Valance.</t3335> <t3336>Quince.</t3336> <t3337>Zygote.</t3337> <t3338>I held each sleek piece, smooth edges, caressing each letter.</t3338> <t3339>Touching them made me feel weak.</t3339> <t3340>This is freedom, even if just for a moment.</t3340> <t3341>Limp, I played.</t3341> <t3342>Gorge1. Too luxurious.</t3342> <t3343>The pieces were like candy, spicy mint flavor, cool just like that.</t3343> <t3344>They used to be called marshmallow candies.</t3344> <t3345>I wanted to put them on my tongue.</t3345> <t3346>There must be a lemon flavor.</t3346> <t3347>The letter C. Cool, slightly tangy on the tongue, delicious.</t3347>
<t3348>I won the first game, let him win the next: I still couldn't figure out what the conditions were, what I could ask for, when negotiating.</t3348>
<t3349>Finally, he told me it was time to go home.</t3349> <t3350>He used exactly those words: go home.</t3350> <t3351>What he meant was to go to my room.</t3351> <t3352>He asked if I could manage, as if the stairs were like the streets at night.</t3352> <t3353>I said I could.</t3353> <t3354>We opened his room door, it creaked once, and we listened intently to the sounds in the hallway.</t3354>
<t3355>It's like we're dating.</t3355> <t3356>It's like sneaking into the dormitory after closing hours.</t3356>
<t3357>It's like a conspiracy.</t3357>
<t3358>“Thank you,” he said, “for playing with me.”</t3358> <t3359>Then came the sentence: “I want you to kiss me.”</t3359>
<t3360>I pondered the idea of lifting the lid of the toilet tank in my bathroom, one night on a bath day, very quickly and quietly, so that Cora, sitting outside on the chair, wouldn't hear.</t3360> <t3361>I could take the sharp lever hidden in my sleeve, sneak it into the Commander's room next time, because such a request always leads to a next time, whether I nod or shake my head.</t3361> <t3362>I pondered the idea of approaching the Commander, to kiss him, here alone, removing his outer garment, as if to allow or invite something further, almost like real love, and wrapping my arms around him to slip the iron rod out of my sleeve and suddenly thrust the sharp end into him, right between the ribs.</t3362> <t3363>I pondered the idea of his blood gushing out, hot like soup, full of lust, soaking my hands.</t3363>
<t3364>But honestly, I didn't think anything like that.</t3364> <t3365>That was added later.</t3365> <t3366>Maybe I should have thought about those things at that time, but the reality is I didn't.</t3366> <t3367>As I said, this is just a reconstruction.</t3367>
<t3368>"Alright," I said.</t3368> <t3369>I came closer and pressed my lips, pursed, against his.</t3369> <t3370>I smelled the scent of aftershave, the usual kind, with a hint of mothballs, which I was familiar with.</t3370> <t3371>But he also felt like someone I had just met.</t3371>
<t3372>He stepped back, looking down at me.</t3372> <t3373>That smile again, like a sheep.</t3373> <t3374>So straightforward.</t3374> <t3375>“It's not like that,” he said.</t3375> <t3376>“It's like you want it that way.”</t3376>
<t3377>You look really sad.</t3377>
<t3378>This too, is a reconstruction.</t3378>
<t3379>IX - Night</t3379>
<t3380>24</t3380>
<t3381>I returned, following the dimly lit hall up the gently soothing stairs, stealthily entering the room.</t3381> <t3382>In the room, I sat on the chair, the light was off, still in my red dress, with all the buttons fastened.</t3382> <t3383>People only think clearly when they are fully dressed.</t3383>
<t3384>What I need is perspective.</t3384> <t3385>The illusion of depth, achieved through composition, the arrangement of shapes on a flat surface.</t3385> <t3386>Perspective is extremely necessary.</t3386> <t3387>Otherwise, there will only be two dimensions.</t3387> <t3388>Otherwise, people will live with their faces pressed flat against the wall, everything in the foreground huge, all details, close-ups, hair, the texture of bed sheets, every molecule of the face.</t3388> <t3389>Skin becomes a map, a useless diagram, crisscrossed with tiny lines going nowhere.</t3389> <t3390>Otherwise, people will live in the present moment.</t3390> <t3391>Which is a place I do not want to be.</t3391>
<t3392>But where I am now, there's no way to escape.</t3392> <t3393>Time has trapped me, and I'm stuck inside.</t3393> <t3394>I must forget the secret name and everything that once was.</t3394> <t3395>My name is now Offred, and this is where I live.</t3395>
<t3396>Live in the present, make the most of it, that's all you have left.</t3396>
<t3397>It's time for inventory.</t3397>
<t3398>I am thirty-three years old.</t3398> <t3399>My hair is brown. I am one meter seventy tall if barefoot.</t3399> <t3400>I can't remember what I used to look like.</t3400> <t3401>I have functioning ovaries.</t3401> <t3402>I have one more chance.</t3402>
<t3403>But something has changed, now, tonight.</t3403> <t3404>The circumstances are different.</t3404>
<t3405>I can demand something.</t3405> <t3406>Maybe not much, but it's still something.</t3406>
<t3407>Men are merely instruments for mating, Aunt Lydia said, nothing more.</t3407> <t3408>They only want one thing.</t3408> <t3409>You must learn to manipulate them, for your own benefit.</t3409> <t3410>You must lead them by the nose; this is just a metaphor.</t3410> <t3411>That's the way nature is. God made it so. Life is like that.</t3411>
<t3412>Aunt Lydia didn't exactly say that, but it was hidden in everything she said.</t3412> <t3413>It hovered over her head, like a golden halo over the saints, back when there was still darkness.</t3413> <t3414>Like them, she was all bones, devoid of flesh.</t3414>
<t3415>But how to fit the Commander into that formula, a Commander sitting in the study, with the game of arranging letters and a longing, longing for what? To have someone to play with, to kiss gently, as I would like.</t3415>
<t3416>I know I need to seriously consider it, this desire.</t3416> <t3417>It could be very important, it could be the ticket out, it could be my dead end.</t3417> <t3418>I need to sincerely think about it, need to weigh it.</t3418> <t3419>But no matter how hard I try, sitting here in the dark, the window frame lit up by headlights from outside, through the thin curtains like a bride's dress, like ghostly skin, hand holding hand, body slightly swaying forward, no matter how hard I try, it still seems indescribably humorous.</t3419>
<t3420>He wants me to play Scrabble with him, and kiss him as if I wanted to.</t3420>
<t3421>This is one of the strangest stories I have ever encountered in my entire life.</t3421>
<t3422>It's all about the context.</t3422>
<t3423>I still remember watching a TV program; a replay, originally from many years ago.</t3423> <t3424>I was about seven or eight years old, watching without understanding.</t3424> <t3425>The program was the type my mother liked: historical storytelling, educational.</t3425> <t3426>Later, my mother tried to explain to me that all those events had happened in real life, but to me, it was still just a story.</t3426> <t3427>I thought someone had made it up.</t3427> <t3428>Surely all children think that way about all of history before they were born.</t3428> <t3429>If it's just a story, it's less scary.</t3429>
<t3430>It is a documentary film about an old war.</t3430> <t3431>They interviewed many people interspersed with contemporary footage, black and white, and photographs.</t3431> <t3432>I don't remember much, but I still recall the quality of the images, everything seemed to be covered with a layer of sun dust, and how dark the shadows under the eyebrows or on the cheekbones were.</t3432>
<t3433>The segments of interviews with living witnesses are all in color.</t3433> <t3434>The person I remember most is the woman who was once the mistress of the manager of a camp for Jews, before they were killed.</t3434> <t3435>By cremation, my mother informed me; but the film did not show the ovens, so I mistakenly thought they had died in the kitchen.</t3435> <t3436>That idea is particularly terrifying for children.</t3436> <t3437>Ovens are for cooking, and cooking is for eating.</t3437> <t3438>I thought those people had been eaten.</t3438> <t3439>And in some way, I think they were.</t3439>
<t3440>According to the story, the man was very fierce and brutal.</t3440> <t3441>The mistress - my mother explained the word mistress, my mother didn't believe it so she told fairy tales to children, I had a pop-up book describing genitalia since I was four - the mistress was once very beautiful.</t3441> <t3442>There is a black and white photo of her and another woman, wearing two-piece swimsuits, platform shoes, and wide-brimmed floral hats, the fashion of those years; they wore cat-eye glasses and sat on deck chairs by the pool.</t3442> <t3443>The pool was next to their house, which means it was very close to the camp with the furnace.</t3443> <t3444>The woman said she didn't notice anything too unusual.</t3444> <t3445>She denied knowing about the furnaces.</t3445>
<t3446>At the time of the interview, four or five decades later, she was in the final stages of emphysema.</t3446> <t3447>She coughed a lot, and was emaciated, almost skin and bones, but still very proud of her appearance.</t3447> <t3448>(Look at her, my mother said, half grumbling, half admiring.</t3448> <t3449>She is still proud of her appearance.)</t3449> <t3450>She applied makeup meticulously, thick mascara on her lashes, pink blush on her cheeks, the skin on her face stretched tight like a taut rubber glove.</t3450> <t3451>She wore pearls.</t3451>
<t3452>He is not a demon, she said.</t3452> <t3453>People say he is a demon, but he is not.</t3453>
<t3454>Did she ever wonder what she was thinking?</t3454> <t3455>Not much, I think; not then, not at that time.</t3455> <t3456>She thought about how not to think.</t3456> <t3457>A grotesque era.</t3457> <t3458>She was proud of her appearance.</t3458> <t3459>She didn't believe he was a devil.</t3459> <t3460>He wasn't a devil, in her eyes.</t3460> <t3461>He had many endearing traits: he often whistled off-key in the bathroom, he constantly nibbled on chocolate candies, he called the dog Liebchen, darling, and made it sit on its hind legs before rewarding it with pieces of raw meat.</t3461> <t3462>It's all too easy to invent humanity for anyone in the world.</t3462> <t3463>Temptation within reach.</t3463> <t3464>Just a big child, she must have told herself.</t3464> <t3465>Her heart softened, she brushed back the hair from his forehead, kissed his ear, not just to extract something from him.</t3465> <t3466>The instinct to soothe, to make everything better.</t3466> <t3467>There, there, she must have said, when he woke from a nightmare.</t3467> <t3468>You've endured so much.</t3468> <t3469>She believed all of that, because how else could she go on living?</t3469> <t3470>She was only human, despite her beauty.</t3470> <t3471>She believed in manners, she was very gentle with the Jewish maid, at least quite gentle, gentler than necessary.</t3471>
<t3472>A few days after recording the interview tape, she committed suicide.</t3472> <t3473>That's what they said, right on television.</t3473>
<t3474>No one asked her if she had ever loved him.</t3474>
<t3475>What I remember most clearly now is the way she did her makeup.</t3475>
<t3476>I stood up, in the dark, and began to unbutton.</t3476> <t3477>Then I heard something, within my body.</t3477> <t3478>I had broken, something had just cracked, no doubt about it.</t3478> <t3479>The sound was rising, escaping, from the place that had just broken, on my face.</t3479> <t3480>Without any warning: I wasn't thinking about here or there or any other place.</t3480> <t3481>If I let the sound escape into the air, it would turn into laughter, too loud, too much, surely someone would hear it, and then hurried footsteps and orders and who knows what else.</t3481> <t3482>Judgment: emotions inappropriate to the situation.</t3482> <t3483>A wandering womb, they used to say.</t3483> <t3484>Hysteria.</t3484> <t3485>And then the injection, the dose.</t3485> <t3486>It could be fatal.</t3486>
<t3487>I covered my mouth with both hands as if about to vomit, collapsed to the floor, and my laughter bubbled like lava in my throat.</t3487> <t3488>I crawled into the closet, curled up, I was going to suffocate.</t3488> <t3489>My ribs ached from holding it in, I shook, I panted, earthquake, volcano, I was about to explode.</t3489> <t3490>Red splattered all over the closet, joy rhymed with labor pain, oh my, dying from laughter.</t3490>
<t3491>I tucked it into the folds of the hanging cloak, squeezed my eyes shut to hold back the tears, and tried to compose myself.</t3491>
<t3492>A moment later it stopped, like a seizure.</t3492> <t3493>Leaving me alone in the cupboard.</t3493> <t3494>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t3494> <t3495>In the dark, I couldn't see, but I ran my fingertips over the tiny engraved letters, like Braille.</t3495> <t3496>Now that phrase echoes in my head not as a prayer, but as a command; but what to do? Either way, it's useless to me, the ancient hieroglyph has lost its deciphering key.</t3496> <t3497>Why did she write it, why go to such trouble? There's no way out of here.</t3497>
<t3498>I lay on the floor, panting, then held back, balanced my breathing, like in a Physical Education class, preparing to give birth.</t3498> <t3499>All I could hear was my own heartbeat, opening then closing, opening then closing, opening.</t3499>
<t3500>X - The Soul Book</t3500>
<t3501>25</t3501>
<t3502>The sound that greeted me the next morning was a scream followed by a clatter.</t3502> <t3503>It was Cora, who had just dropped the tray of food.</t3503> <t3504>I woke up with a start.</t3504> <t3505>I was still half inside the closet, my head buried in a bulky robe.</t3505> <t3506>I must have pulled it off the hanger and then fallen asleep; it took me a minute to understand where I was.</t3506> <t3507>Cora was kneeling beside me, and I felt a hand on my back.</t3507> <t3508>She screamed again when I moved.</t3508>
<t3509>What is that? I asked.</t3509> <t3510>I turned over and sat up.</t3510>
<t3511>Oh, she said.</t3511> <t3512>I thought.</t3512>
<t3513>What does she think?</t3513>
<t3514>It's just like... she said.</t3514>
<t3515>The eggs have shattered, there is orange juice and glass shards on the floor.</t3515>
<t3516>I will have to bring the new one, she said.</t3516> <t3517>What a waste.</t3517> <t3518>What are you doing lying on the floor? She was grabbing me and pulling, to lift me up, properly, neatly.</t3518>
<t3519>I don't want to say that I haven't even gone to bed yet.</t3519> <t3520>Trying to explain that is impossible.</t3520> <t3521>I said I must have fainted.</t3521> <t3522>It was just as bad, because she immediately seized on that statement.</t3522>
<t3523>That's the initial sign, she said, very pleased.</t3523> <t3524>That and vomiting too.</t3524> <t3525>She had to know that it wasn't enough time yet, but she was still very optimistic.</t3525>
<t3526>No, it's not that, I said.</t3526> <t3527>At this moment, I am sitting on the chair.</t3527> <t3528>Definitely not.</t3528> <t3529>I'm just dizzy.</t3529> <t3530>I was standing here and then I suddenly blacked out.</t3530>
<t3531>It's probably due to stress, she said, from yesterday and everything. It made her break down.</t3531>
<t3532>She mentioned Sinh's party, and I said yes.</t3532> <t3533>Up until now, I was still sitting on the chair, while she was kneeling on the floor, picking up pieces of glass and eggs, and putting them all into the tray.</t3533> <t3534>She absorbed some of the orange juice with a paper towel.</t3534>
<t3535>I will have to get a rag, she said.</t3535> <t3536>Everyone will ask why more eggs are needed.</t3536> <t3537>Unless you can hold out.</t3537> <t3538>She looked up slyly, and I understood that it was better for both of us to pretend that I had eaten breakfast as usual.</t3538> <t3539>If she said she saw me lying unconscious on the floor, there would be a lot of questions asked.</t3539> <t3540>Either way, she would have to explain the broken cup, but Rita would be grumpy if she had to cook another meal.</t3540>
<t3541>I can hold on, I said.</t3541> <t3542>I'm not too hungry.</t3542> <t3543>That way, it can eat with the child without feeling dizzy.</t3543> <t3544>But I will have a piece of bread, I said.</t3544> <t3545>I don't want to have nothing in my stomach.</t3545>
<t3546>It has hit the floor already, she said.</t3546>
<t3547>No problem, I said.</t3547> <t3548>I sat there chewing a piece of brown toast while she went into the bathroom to wash away the irredeemable eggs.</t3548> <t3549>Then she came back out.</t3549>
<t3550>I will pretend to have dropped the tray on the way out, she said.</t3550>
<t3551>I am very happy to see you are willing to lie for me, even over small matters, even for yourself.</t3551> <t3552>It creates a bond between us.</t3552>
<t3553>I smiled at her.</t3553> <t3554>Hope no one heard you say that, I said.</t3554>
<t3555>I was also scared, she said, standing in the doorway with a tray in her hands.</t3555> <t3556>At first, I thought it was just your clothes, something like that.</t3556> <t3557>Then I told myself, why are they lying on the floor? I thought maybe you had...</t3557>
<t3558>Run away, I said.</t3558>
<t3559>Um, but, she said.</t3559> <t3560>But it was her.</t3560>
<t3561>Yes, I said.</t3561> <t3562>It's me.</t3562>
<t3563>And that's how it was, and she took the tray out and then brought a rag back to wipe up the spilled water, and that afternoon Rita grumbled about someone being extremely clumsy.</t3563> <t3564>Thinking about everything under the sun, not knowing where I was going anymore, she said, and we continued as if nothing had happened.</t3564>
<t3565>It was May. Now spring had left its footsteps behind.</t3565> <t3566>The tulip beds had reached their peak of glory and had faded, shedding petals one by one, like losing teeth.</t3566> <t3567>One day I stumbled upon Serena Joy, kneeling on a cushion in the garden, her cane on the grass.</t3567> <t3568>She was using garden shears to trim all the seed pods.</t3568> <t3569>I glanced sideways as I walked past her, carrying a basket of oranges and lamb chops.</t3569> <t3570>She aimed, placed the blades in position, then made a cut, her hand twitching in a very peculiar way.</t3570> <t3571>Was this due to arthritis, creeping up on her?</t3571> <t3572>Or was it a Blitzkrieg, a kamikaze attack, aimed at the swollen reproductive organs of the flowers?</t3572> <t3573>Removing the seed pods is considered a way to help the plant store nutrients in its bulbs.</t3573>
<t3574>Saint Serena, kneeling, is repenting.</t3574>
<t3575>I often entertained myself that way, with petty, bitter jokes about her, but not for long.</t3575> <t3576>Idly watching Serena Joy from behind didn't accomplish anything either.</t3576>
<t3577>I long for those garden shears.</t3577>
<t3578>Sigh.</t3578> <t3579>Then we planted irises, rising gracefully and flamboyantly on their lofty stems, as if blown from glass, like pale-colored water frozen in mid-splash, light blue, pale lavender, or darker hues, velvet and purple, black cat ears in the sun, evening indigo, and bleeding heart flowers, so delicately imagined that it’s surprising to remember they were just recently uprooted.</t3579> <t3580>Serena's garden had a rebellious quality, with buried things competing to outdo each other, silently reaching for the light, as if to show, to say: What is silenced will clamor to be heard, even without making a sound.</t3580> <t3581>A Tennyson-like garden, heavy with scent, languid; the resurgence of the word swoon.</t3581> <t3582>Light poured down from the sky, indeed, but the heat also rose up, from the very flowers themselves, palpably felt: like holding a hand a few inches above an arm, a shoulder.</t3582> <t3583>It breathed, in the warmth, inhaling itself fully.</t3583> <t3584>Walking through the garden these days, between red peonies, pink and purple carnations, my head swam.</t3584>
<t3585>The willow trees are displaying their dense foliage and doing nothing more, as they continuously whisper near and far.</t3585> <t3586>Promises, it reminds, stirring, the sound of the wind rustling runs along my spine, I shiver as if with fever.</t3586> <t3587>The summer dress rustles against the skin of my thigh, grass grows around my feet, my eyes are full of movement, among the leaves and branches: feathers, branch-hopping, trills, trees turning into birds, transforming into frenzy.</t3587> <t3588>The goddesses descend within reach, the air brimming with sensuality.</t3588> <t3589>Even the house bricks soften, inviting touch; if I lean against them, I would feel them warm and comforting.</t3589> <t3590>Strange what abstinence can cause.</t3590> <t3591>Was it just seeing my ankle that made him dizzy, almost faint, at the checkpoint yesterday, when I dropped my passport and he picked it up for me? Without a handkerchief or fan, I used what was available.</t3591>
<t3592>Winter is not that dangerous.</t3592> <t3593>I need to be tough, cold, and solid; I don't want to be heavy, like a melon hanging by its stem, I don't want to be overripe and bursting with juice like this.</t3593>
<t3594>The commander and I have settled everything.</t3594> <t3595>It's not the first settlement in history, though it wasn't done in the usual way.</t3595>
<t3596>I go to the Commander's room two or three times a week, always after dinner, but only when there is a signal.</t3596> <t3597>A signal from Nick.</t3597> <t3598>If he is polishing the car when I go out shopping, or when I return, and his hat is tilted to one side or he is not wearing it, then I go.</t3598> <t3599>If he is absent or wearing his hat normally, I stay in my room as usual.</t3599> <t3600>Of course, the nights of the Ceremony do not count.</t3600>
<t3601>The obstacle was Lady, as in all other cases.</t3601> <t3602>After dinner, she would return to her bedroom, from where she could completely hear me sneaking down the stairs, even though I always carefully stepped very lightly.</t3602> <t3603>Sometimes she would sit in the lounge, diligently knitting those endless angelic scarves, adding more yards of exquisitely worthless wool: her own form of reproduction, I suppose.</t3603> <t3604>The lounge door was often ajar when she was in there, and I didn't dare to pass by.</t3604> <t3605>When I was summoned but couldn't go, downstairs or across the hall past the lounge, the Commander always understood.</t3605> <t3606>He understood my situation better than anyone else.</t3606> <t3607>He knew all the rules.</t3607>
<t3608>However, sometimes Serena Joy is also away from home, visiting another Commander's Wife who is ill; that's the only place I can imagine her going, alone, in the evening.</t3608> <t3609>She carries food, sweet cakes, savory cakes, or bread baked by Rita, or a jar of homemade mint jelly, made from the mint leaves in her garden.</t3609> <t3610>As for the Wives, they often fall ill.</t3610> <t3611>It adds a bit of color to their lives.</t3611> <t3612>As for us, the Handmaids and even the Marthas, we avoid illness as much as possible.</t3612> <t3613>The Marthas don't want to be forced into retirement, because who knows where they will go?</t3613> <t3614>Nowadays, you hardly see any old women in the city.</t3614> <t3615>As for us, if we truly fall ill, feel weak, lose weight or appetite, lose hair, or have any gland issues, it would be a death sentence.</t3615> <t3616>I still remember Cora, early in the spring, trying to drag herself around the house despite having the flu, clinging to the door when she thought no one would replace her, doing her best to stifle her cough.</t3616> <t3617>Just a mild cold, she replied to Serena's inquiry.</t3617>
<t3618>Even Serena sometimes takes a few days off, wrapped tightly in a bunch of blankets.</t3618> <t3619>During those times, it is her turn to entertain friends; the ladies bustle up and down the stairs, cheerfully laughing; she receives sweet and savory pastries, jams, and flowers cut from their gardens.</t3619>
<t3620>They take turns.</t3620> <t3621>There is some kind of list, invisible, implicitly understood.</t3621> <t3622>Everyone is careful not to take more than their share of attention.</t3622>
<t3623>On the nights I knew Serena would leave, I would inevitably be called.</t3623>
<t3624>The first time I was quite bewildered.</t3624> <t3625>The things he needed from me I couldn't grasp, and in my perception, they seemed absurd, ridiculous, like the fondness for lace-up shoes.</t3625>
<t3626>At the same time, there was also a bit of disappointment.</t3626> <t3627>What was I expecting, behind the still-closed door, when I stood there for the first time?</t3627> <t3628>Something that cannot be named, crawling on all fours perhaps, depraved, whipping, mutilation?</t3628> <t3629>At the very least, some mild debauchery, an old rebellious habit that had slipped away from him, a serious crime by law, punishable by amputation.</t3629> <t3630>Playing Scrabble, instead, like an old married couple, or two kids, could be considered extraordinarily bizarre, a different kind of violation.</t3630> <t3631>A proposal too vague.</t3631>
<t3632>So when I left the room, I still didn't understand what he wanted, why, or whether I could meet any of his demands.</t3632> <t3633>If planning a negotiation, the terms of exchange must be laid out on the table.</t3633> <t3634>Clearly, this had not been done.</t3634> <t3635>I thought he was baiting me, playing cat and mouse, but now I think perhaps even he wasn't fully aware of his own motives and desires.</t3635> <t3636>They had not yet reached the level of words.</t3636>
<t3637>The second evening began just like the previous one.</t3637> <t3638>I went to the door, still closed, knocked, and was let in.</t3638> <t3639>Then came two games just the same, with smooth, golden pieces.</t3639> <t3640>Prolix, quartz, quandary, sylph, rhythm2, all the old consonant tricks I could think of or remember.</t3640> <t3641>My tongue hurt from trying to pronounce the words.</t3641> <t3642>It was like using a language once learned but almost entirely forgotten, a language tied to customs long gone: café au lait placed on a table outside the door, brioche bread, absinthe beer in tall glasses, lobsters wrapped in newspaper shaped like a horn; things I had read about but never seen with my own eyes.</t3642> <t3643>It was like trying to walk without crutches, like those fake scenes in old TV shows.</t3643> <t3644>You can do it.</t3644> <t3645>I know you can do it.</t3645> <t3646>My mind kept groping and stumbling around the sharp R's and T's, gliding swiftly over the round vowels like pebbles.</t3646>
<t3647>The commander showed patience whenever I hesitated or asked him how to write something correctly.</t3647> <t3648>You can look it up in the dictionary, he said.</t3648> <t3649>Tell me.</t3649> <t3650>For the first time, I realized he had let me win.</t3650>
<t3651>That night I thought everything would be the same, until the goodbye kiss.</t3651> <t3652>But after finishing the next game, he leaned back in his chair.</t3652> <t3653>He placed his hands on the armrests, with his ten fingers pressed together, looking at me.</t3653>
<t3654>I have a little gift for you, he said.</t3654>
<t3655>He smiled slightly.</t3655> <t3656>Then he opened the top drawer and took out something.</t3656> <t3657>He held it for a minute, rather indifferently, between his thumb and forefinger, as if pondering whether to give it to me or not.</t3657> <t3658>Even though I was looking at it from an angle, I still recognized it.</t3658> <t3659>In the past, they were everywhere.</t3659> <t3660>A magazine, judging by the picture it was probably a women's magazine, with a model printed on glossy paper, hair tousled, scarf around her neck, lips painted; fall fashion.</t3660> <t3661>I thought this type had been completely destroyed, but here it was, a leftover issue, in the private room of a Commander, where no one would have imagined.</t3661> <t3662>He looked down at the model, in the same direction; the smile still lingered, a characteristic wistful smile.</t3662> <t3663>That look people often give to near-extinct animals in a zoo.</t3663>
<t3664>Eyes glued to the magazine, his hand dangling in front of my nose, I craved it.</t3664> <t3665>I craved it so intensely that my fingertips ached.</t3665> <t3666>At the same time, I found this craving so trivial and bizarre, because in the past I had despised them so much.</t3666> <t3667>I had read them in the dentist's office, sometimes on the plane; I bought them to bring to the hotel, killing time while waiting for Luke to arrive.</t3667> <t3668>After flipping through the pages, I would toss them into a corner, because these things were so abundant and disposable, and a day or two later I would completely forget what was in them.</t3668>
<t3669>Even now, I still remember.</t3669> <t3670>There was a promise in it.</t3670> <t3671>Those magazines talked about transformation, presenting endless possibilities, expanding like reflections in two opposing mirrors, multiplying endlessly, one copy after another, triumphing infinitely.</t3671> <t3672>After one venture, they presented another venture, after one set of clothes, another set, after one progress, another progress, after one man, another man.</t3672> <t3673>They presented rejuvenation, the path to overcoming and conquering pain, eternal love.</t3673> <t3674>The promise, in the end, was about immortality.</t3674>
<t3675>And it was in his hands, but he didn't know.</t3675> <t3676>He flipped through the pages.</t3676> <t3677>I felt myself reaching out.</t3677>
<t3678>This book is old, he said, a kind of curiosity.</t3678> <t3679>From the seventies, maybe. Vogue.</t3679> <t3680>Like a connoisseur dropping a wine label.</t3680> <t3681>I thought maybe you would like it.</t3681>
<t3682>I restrained myself.</t3682> <t3683>Maybe he was testing to see how deeply the teachings had truly sunk in.</t3683> <t3684>This is forbidden, I said.</t3684>
<t3685>Here, no, he said quietly.</t3685> <t3686>I understand your point.</t3686> <t3687>Having already broken the most serious rule, why should I care about something else, something more trivial? Then another thing, and another; who knows where the stopping point is?</t3687> <t3688>Behind this door, all rules vanish.</t3688>
<t3689>I picked up the newspaper and turned it towards myself.</t3689> <t3690>Here they are again, those childhood images: bold, striding long, confident, arms swinging as if to claim space, legs spread wide, firmly planted on the floor.</t3690> <t3691>A very Renaissance posture, but I was thinking of princes, not maidens with headscarves and curly locks.</t3691> <t3692>Eyes looking straight ahead, indeed with makeup, but not unlike a cat's eyes, intensely focused, ready to pounce.</t3692> <t3693>No trembling or clinging, in that cloak or rough tweed outfit, in those knee-high boots.</t3693> <t3694>Female bandit leaders, exactly, with a devilish leather bag hiding the spoils, accompanied by greedy horse-like teeth.</t3694>
<t3695>I felt the Commander’s eyes following me as I flipped through each page.</t3695> <t3696>I knew I was doing something that was supposed to be forbidden, and I also knew he was gleefully watching me do it.</t3696> <t3697>By Aunt Lydia’s standards, I should have seen myself as wicked; according to her, I belonged to the wicked side.</t3697> <t3698>But I didn’t see it that way.</t3698> <t3699>I saw myself like an early 20th-century English seaside postcard: playful.</t3699> <t3700>What would he give me next? A corset?</t3700>
<t3701>Why do you have this?</t3701> <t3702>I asked.</t3702>
<t3703>Among us, he said, there are those who still hold admiration for the ancient times.</t3703>
<t3704>But these should have been burned already, I said.</t3704> <t3705>They searched every house, they destroyed...</t3705>
<t3706>What is dangerous when it falls into the hands of the masses, he said, unable to distinguish whether it is sarcasm or not, is safe in the hands of those who have motives...</t3706>
<t3707>Beyond reproach, I said.</t3707>
<t3708>He nodded solemnly.</t3708> <t3709>Unable to guess if he truly thought that way.</t3709>
<t3710>But why show it to me?</t3710> <t3711>I asked, and immediately felt foolish.</t3711> <t3712>What else could he be saying?</t3712> <t3713>That he wants to have fun and is using me as the price?</t3713> <t3714>Because he must know how much it pains me to remember the past.</t3714>
<t3715>I couldn't anticipate his answer.</t3715> <t3716>Who else can I show it to?</t3716> <t3717>He spoke, and the previous sadness echoed again.</t3717>
<t3718>Should I push further? I thought.</t3718> <t3719>I don't want to rush him, too fast, too far.</t3719> <t3720>I know I'm the type no one fears missing out on.</t3720> <t3721>But I still said, as softly as a breath, What about your wife?</t3721>
<t3722>He seemed to be thinking.</t3722> <t3723>No, he said.</t3723> <t3724>She wouldn't understand.</t3724> <t3725>Anyway, she doesn't talk to me much anymore.</t3725> <t3726>It seems we have little in common these days.</t3726>
<t3727>So there it is, laid bare: your wife doesn't understand you.</t3727>
<t3728>The reason I came here, so that's it.</t3728> <t3729>Still the same old story.</t3729> <t3730>So boring it's unbelievable.</t3730>
<t3731>On the third night, I asked him if he had any lotion. I didn't want to start begging, but I wanted something within my reach.</t3731>
<t3732>What milk is that? he asked, still as polite as usual.</t3732> <t3733>He sat opposite me on the other side of the table.</t3733> <t3734>He hardly touched me, except for the customary single kiss.</t3734> <t3735>No groping, no heavy breathing or anything like that, it felt like such things were out of place here, for both him and me.</t3735>
<t3736>Skin lotion, I said.</t3736> <t3737>Or face cream.</t3737> <t3738>Our skin is dry.</t3738> <t3739>Unintentionally, I said "we" instead of "I."</t3739> <t3740>I also wanted to ask for bath oil, those small colorful beads that used to be easy to find, appearing like magic before my eyes in a round glass bowl in the corner of my mother's bathroom.</t3740> <t3741>But I thought he probably wouldn't know.</t3741> <t3742>Anyway, no one probably makes bath oil anymore.</t3742>
<t3743>Dry? The commander said, as if he had never thought of that.</t3743> <t3744>So, how do you do it?</t3744>
<t3745>We use butter, I said.</t3745> <t3746>When we can get it.</t3746> <t3747>Or margarine.</t3747> <t3748>Usually margarine.</t3748>
<t3749>Butter, he said thoughtfully.</t3749> <t3750>Very clever.</t3750> <t3751>Butter. He laughed out loud.</t3751>
<t3752>I almost slapped him in the face.</t3752>
<t3753>I think I can make it, he said, in a way to please a child asking for bubble gum.</t3753> <t3754>But she can sniff you out.</t3754> <t3755>I suspect this fear might come from old experiences.</t3755> <t3756>Old as time: lipstick marks on the neck, perfume on the wrist, someone dancing tango, late at night, in the kitchen or bedroom.</t3756> <t3757>A man with no experience at all wouldn't think of it.</t3757> <t3758>Unless he is more cunning than he appears.</t3758>
<t3759>I will be careful, I said.</t3759> <t3760>Moreover, she never comes too close to me.</t3760>
<t3761>Sometimes, yes, he said.</t3761>
<t3762>I look down.</t3762> <t3763>I had forgotten about that.</t3763> <t3764>I feel myself blushing.</t3764> <t3765>I won't use those nights, I said.</t3765>
<t3766>On the fourth night, he gave me a plastic bottle without a label.</t3766> <t3767>It wasn't the high-quality type; it had a slight smell of vegetable oil.</t3767> <t3768>The lilies in the valley were not for me.</t3768> <t3769>It was probably the kind made for use in hospitals, to apply on bedsores from prolonged lying down.</t3769> <t3770>But I still said thank you.</t3770>
<t3771>The trouble is, I said, I can't put it anywhere.</t3771>
<t3772>Her room, he said, as if it were a very simple matter.</t3772>
<t3773>They found out immediately, I said.</t3773> <t3774>Someone found out immediately.</t3774>
<t3775>Why? he asked, as if he genuinely didn't know.</t3775> <t3776>Perhaps he truly didn't.</t3776> <t3777>It wasn't the first time he revealed that he had no idea what our actual living conditions were.</t3777>
<t3778>They searched, I said.</t3778> <t3779>They searched all over our room.</t3779>
<t3780>What are you looking for? he asked.</t3780>
<t3781>I think I was a bit flustered at that moment.</t3781> <t3782>Find the razor blade, I said.</t3782> <t3783>Books, writings, black market goods.</t3783> <t3784>All the things we were forbidden to touch.</t3784> <t3785>Jesus, you must know that.</t3785> <t3786>My voice was angrier than I intended, but he didn't even flinch.</t3786>
<t3787>So you have to leave it here, he said.</t3787>
<t3788>That means I do it that way.</t3788>
<t3789>He looked at me, rubbing his hands all over and then his face, with an attitude as if peering through the bars.</t3789> <t3790>I wanted to turn my back - it felt like he was in the bathroom with me - but I didn't dare.</t3790>
<t3791>To him, don't forget, I was just a fleeting whim.</t3791>
<t3792>26</t3792>
<t3793>When the festival night came again, two or three weeks later, I noticed a change.</t3793> <t3794>An unprecedented awkwardness.</t3794> <t3795>Previously, I considered this a task, a tedious task that needed to be done quickly to get it over with as soon as possible.</t3795> <t3796>Brace yourself, mother often said that, before hateful exams, or before jumping into the icy cold pool.</t3796> <t3797>Back then, I never thought carefully about what it meant, but it was associated with metal, with armor, and I would do that, I would forge myself into solid steel.</t3797> <t3798>I would pretend not to be here, not to be flesh and bone.</t3798>
<t3799>The state of detachment, existing outside the body, had been applied by the Commander for a long time, now I understand.</t3799> <t3800>Surely he was thinking about something else the whole time he was with me; with us, because of course Serena Joy was present, every night.</t3800> <t3801>He could have been thinking about the day's events, about the golf game, or about dinner.</t3801> <t3802>The act of intercourse, though he still performed it perfunctorily, was probably done mostly unconsciously, like scratching himself.</t3802>
<t3803>But that night, the first Ceremony since the new arrangement began, whatever you want to call it, I felt embarrassed.</t3803> <t3804>First of all, I noticed that he did look at me, and I didn't like it.</t3804> <t3805>The lights were glaring, as always, because Serena Joy had carefully removed anything that might create an atmosphere of intimacy or sensuality, no matter how small: the lights directly overhead, harsh and bright, even though there was a filter.</t3805> <t3806>It felt like lying on an operating table, with all eyes on me; like being on stage.</t3806> <t3807>I was conscious of my legs being hairy and stubbly, the way they grow back after shaving; I was also aware of my armpits, even though he couldn't see them.</t3807> <t3808>I felt crude.</t3808> <t3809>This act of copulation, which you could call insemination, should have been as natural as a bee pollinating a flower, but now it felt indecent to me, breaking the rules in a shameful way, which it hadn't before.</t3809>
<t3810>He is no longer an object to me.</t3810> <t3811>That's the unfortunate truth. That night I realized it, and I couldn't shake it off.</t3811> <t3812>Everything became complicated.</t3812>
<t3813>Even Serena Joy has changed towards me.</t3813> <t3814>Previously, I purely hated her because she was involved in what was happening to my body; and because she also hated me and resented my face, and because she would take on the upbringing of my child, if I could bear one.</t3814> <t3815>But now, although I still hate her, not more than when she tightened the ring to cut my finger, and pulled my arm back, surely intending to cause me as much trouble as possible, that hatred is no longer as simple and pure as before.</t3815> <t3816>In some ways, I am jealous of her, but how can one be jealous of a woman who is so obviously exhausted and unhappy? One only envies someone who possesses something one should have.</t3816> <t3817>Yet I still envy her.</t3817>
<t3818>But I also felt guilty towards her.</t3818> <t3819>As if I were an intruder, in a territory that should have been under her control.</t3819>
<t3820>Adding more secret meetings like now, even if it's just playing with typesetting and listening to the Commander talk, our duties are no longer as clear-cut as in theory, I am taking something from her, even though she doesn't know.</t3820> <t3821>I am stealing it away.</t3821> <t3822>Regardless of whether it is something she clearly doesn't want, or doesn't use, or has rejected, it is still hers, and if I take away "it", this mysterious "it" that I can't even define myself - because the Commander doesn't love me, I would never believe he has such deep feelings for me - then what does she have left?</t3822>
<t3823>Why bother? I told myself.</t3823> <t3824>She is nothing to me, she is unpleasant, she will throw me out of the house, or do something worse, as soon as she thinks of a reason.</t3824> <t3825>If she finds out, for instance.</t3825> <t3826>He won't be able to intervene, won't be able to save me; all violations by women in the household, whether Martha or Handmaid, are by law under the Wife's jurisdiction.</t3826> <t3827>She is malicious and hateful, that much I know.</t3827> <t3828>But I still can't shake off this small regret.</t3828>
<t3829>Not only that: now I have power over her, almost like that, even though she doesn't know it.</t3829> <t3830>And I'm thrilled. Why pretend? I'm absolutely thrilled.</t3830>
<t3831>But the Commander could expose me so easily, a look, a gesture, a small slip could reveal to anyone watching that there is something between us now.</t3831> <t3832>That almost happened on Ceremony night.</t3832> <t3833>He reached out as if to touch my face; I turned my head to the side, to ward him off, hoping Serena Joy wouldn't notice, and he withdrew his hand, retreating into his own focused journey.</t3833>
<t3834>Never repeat it, I said as soon as I met him privately.</t3834>
<t3835>Repeat what? he asked.</t3835>
<t3836>To touch me like that, while... while she was there.</t3836>
<t3837>Did I do that? he asked.</t3837>
<t3838>He can have me transferred, I said.</t3838> <t3839>To the Colonies.</t3839> <t3840>You know that. Or worse.</t3840> <t3841>I think he should continue, in the crowd, treating me like a piece of furniture or a window frame: blending into the background, motionless or transparent.</t3841>
<t3842>I'm sorry, he said.</t3842> <t3843>I didn't mean to.</t3843> <t3844>But I saw it...</t3844>
<t3845>What? I said, seeing him pause.</t3845>
<t3846>Lacking people, he said.</t3846>
<t3847>How long did it take for you to realize? I said.</t3847> <t3848>Surely, anyone could tell from the way we spoke that we had moved on to a different stage.</t3848>
<t3849>Aunt Lydia said that future generations would enjoy better things.</t3849><t3850>Women will live in harmony with each other, all in one family; they will be like their daughters, and when the population reaches the right level, they will no longer be transferred from house to house because there will be enough people to distribute.</t3850><t3851>There will be deep bonds, she said, blinking tenderly at us, born from that life.</t3851><t3852>Women united for a common goal! Helping each other with daily tasks while holding hands on life's journey, each with her own duty.</t3852><t3853>Why demand a single woman to perform all the duties to keep the household running smoothly? It's absurd, it's inhumane.</t3853><t3854>Your daughters will be much freer.</t3854><t3855>We are advocating for each of you to have a small garden, your own - remember, holding hands tightly, voice as light as a breath - and that's just one example.</t3855><t3856>A finger raised to scold us.</t3856><t3857>But we must not whine and complain more than the situation allows, right?</t3857>
<t3858>The truth is, I am his mistress.</t3858> <t3859>Wealthy men have always had mistresses, so why should it be different now?</t3859> <t3860>The terms have changed somewhat, that I admit.</t3860> <t3861>Mistresses used to be hidden in small houses or separate apartments, but now they are integrated.</t3861> <t3862>But other than that, it remains the same, fundamentally.</t3862> <t3863>Women on the outside, as they used to be called, in some countries.</t3863> <t3864>I am that woman on the outside.</t3864> <t3865>My duty is to provide what is lacking.</t3865> <t3866>Even a game of Scrabble.</t3866> <t3867>A position both ridiculous and humiliating.</t3867>
<t3868>Sometimes I think she knows.</t3868> <t3869>Sometimes I think they are in cahoots with each other.</t3869> <t3870>Sometimes I think she is pulling his strings to make him do it, and now she is mocking me, just as I, at times, full of sarcasm, mock myself.</t3870> <t3871>Just let it bear the burden, perhaps she has told herself.</t3871> <t3872>Maybe she is withdrawing from him, almost completely; maybe that's how she finds her freedom.</t3872>
<t3873>But even so - and how stupid this is - I am still happier than before.</t3873> <t3874>At least, there is something to do.</t3874> <t3875>There is a way to pass the time, at night, not just sitting alone in the room.</t3875> <t3876>There is a new topic for me to think about.</t3876> <t3877>I don't love the Commander or anything, but he makes me curious, he has substance, not just a ghostly figure.</t3877>
<t3878>Just like me with him, to him I am no longer just a useful body.</t3878> <t3879>No longer just an empty boat without cargo, an empty cup without wine, an oven – crudely speaking – without bread.</t3879> <t3880>To him, I am no longer empty.</t3880>
<t3881>27</t3881>
<t3882>I walk down the summer street with Ofglen.</t3882> <t3883>The weather is warm and pleasant, ideal for sunglasses and flip-flops, like in the old days.</t3883> <t3884>Both baskets are filled with strawberries - strawberries are in season now, and we eat them until we feel sick - and some grilled fish.</t3884> <t3885>The fish is from the Bread and Fish shop, with its wooden sign, a smiling fish with a curved tail.</t3885> <t3886>But they don't sell bread.</t3886> <t3887>Most households bake their own, though when in need, you can find dry sweet rolls or twisted bagels at the Daily Bread shop.</t3887> <t3888>The Bread and Fish shop rarely opens.</t3888> <t3889>Why bother opening when there's nothing to sell?</t3889> <t3890>The sea fishing industry has been shut down for many years; the few remaining fish are farm-raised, tasting like mud.</t3890> <t3891>The news says the coastal areas are "taking a break."</t3891> <t3892>I still remember halibut, cod, swordfish, clams, tuna; lobsters, wrapped and baked, salmon, rich and pink, cut into steaks and grilled.</t3892> <t3893>Could they all be extinct, along with the whales?</t3893> <t3894>I heard that news, in whispers, lips barely moving, while standing in line on the street, waiting for the shop to open, all drawn by the pictures of pristine white fish on the window.</t3894> <t3895>They put up the pictures when there is stock, and take them down when it's gone.</t3895> <t3896>The language of signs.</t3896>
<t3897>Today, Ofglen and I walked very slowly; the long dress is very stifling, under the armpits is soaking wet, we are tired.</t3897> <t3898>At least in this heat, we don't have to wear gloves.</t3898>
<t3899>There used to be an ice cream shop somewhere in this area.</t3899> <t3900>I don't remember the name.</t3900> <t3901>Everything changes so quickly, the rows of houses get demolished or transformed into something else, it's hard to keep the image in your mind exactly as it was.</t3901> <t3902>You could buy a double serving, and if you asked, the seller would sprinkle chocolate chips on top.</t3902> <t3903>That dish had a man's name.</t3903> <t3904>Johnnie? Or Jackie? I don't remember anymore.</t3904>
<t3905>We used to go there often, back when my child was still small. I would lift them up so they could see clearly through the glass cover of the counter, where the ice cream bowls were displayed, in various eye-catching colors: light orange, light blue, light pink. I would read the names of each type for them to choose.</t3905> <t3906>But they didn't choose by name, but by color.</t3906> <t3907>Their dresses and clothes were also in those same colors.</t3907> <t3908>A palette of light colors like ice cream.</t3908>
<t3909>Jimmie, that's right.</t3909>
<t3910>Ofglen and I are more comfortable now, we have gotten to know each other a little.</t3910> <t3911>Conjoined twins.</t3911> <t3912>Now we don't bother much with formal greetings, just smile and start walking, one ahead of the other, quietly strolling along our daily route.</t3912> <t3913>Sometimes we change the route; no one forbids it, as long as we stay within the barriers.</t3913> <t3914>The mouse in the maze is free to run wherever it wants, as long as it stays in the maze.</t3914>
<t3915>We have finished going through the shops, past the church; now we are at the Wall.</t3915> <t3916>Today the wall is completely empty, people don't leave bodies for long like they did in the winter, there would be flies and smell.</t3916> <t3917>In the past, this used to be the domain of spray paint, pine scent, and the smell of flowers, and people still maintain that preference; especially the Commanders, who preach purity in all things.</t3917>
<t3918>"Have you bought everything you need?" Ofglen asked me, even though she knew the answer was yes.</t3918> <t3919>The shopping list is rarely long.</t3919> <t3920>Recently, she has become less passive, less gloomy.</t3920> <t3921>She often starts conversations with me first.</t3921>
<t3922>“Enough,” I said.</t3922>
<t3923>"Let's go that way," she said.</t3923> <t3924>She meant to continue, towards the river.</t3924> <t3925>It had been a long time since we last went that way.</t3925>
<t3926>“Alright,” I said.</t3926> <t3927>But I did not turn away immediately; I still stood there, looking at the Wall one last time.</t3927> <t3928>Red bricks, floodlights, barbed wire, hooks.</t3928> <t3929>Somehow, the empty Wall seemed even more menacing.</t3929> <t3930>When there were people on it, at least you could see the worst of it.</t3930> <t3931>But when the wall was empty, the potential remained, like a storm approaching.</t3931> <t3932>When I saw the bodies, the corpses before my eyes, when I gauged their size and shape and did not see Luke, I could still believe that he was alive.</t3932>
<t3933>I don't know why I thought he would show up here.</t3933> <t3934>Maybe he has been killed in hundreds of other places.</t3934> <t3935>But I can't shake the thought that he is in there, right now, behind the empty red bricks.</t3935>
<t3936>I try to imagine which house he is in.</t3936> <t3937>I still remember where the houses are, behind that wall; we used to walk freely inside when this was still a university.</t3937> <t3938>Now sometimes we still go in there, attending the Women's Redemption ceremonies.</t3938> <t3939>Most of the houses are also built with red bricks, some areas have arches, a Romanesque touch, from the nineteenth century.</t3939> <t3940>Now we are not allowed to enter the buildings anymore, but who would want to go in?</t3940> <t3941>Those houses belong to the Eyes.</t3941>
<t3942>He might be in the library.</t3942> <t3943>Somewhere in the basement.</t3943> <t3944>In the book storage.</t3944>
<t3945>The library is like a temple.</t3945> <t3946>A long white staircase leads up to a row of aligned doors.</t3946> <t3947>Deep inside, there is another white staircase going up.</t3947> <t3948>On the walls on both sides are angels.</t3948> <t3949>There are also people engaged in battle, or about to charge, clean and noble, not dirty, bloody, and foul-smelling as they would be in real life.</t3949> <t3950>Victory is on one side of the inner door, guiding them forward, on the other side is Death.</t3950> <t3951>This mural is meant to honor some war.</t3951> <t3952>The people on Death's side are still alive.</t3952> <t3953>They are on their way to heaven.</t3953> <t3954>Death is a beautiful woman with wings, one breast almost bare; or is it Victory? I can't remember.</t3954>
<t3955>They probably won't destroy that.</t3955>
<t3956>We turned away from the Wall, turned left, here there were a few empty shops, soap written in squiggly letters on the glass door.</t3956> <t3957>I tried to remember what they used to sell, back in the day.</t3957> <t3958>Cosmetics? Jewelry?</t3958> <t3959>Most of the shops serving men were still operating normally; only those selling what were called luxury items were closed.</t3959>
<t3960>At the corner of the street is a store named Soul Book.</t3960> <t3961>There is an entire chain of stores: Soul Book is present in the center of every city, every suburb, or at least that's what they say.</t3961> <t3962>It must be making quite a bit of money.</t3962>
<t3963>The window is made of unbreakable glass.</t3963> <t3964>Inside are rows of printers; they are called the Rolling Gods, but only we know this very irreverent nickname among ourselves.</t3964> <t3965>The printed products are prayer scrolls, rolling out endlessly.</t3965> <t3966>They are ordered via computer phone, I overheard the Lady Commander making a call.</t3966> <t3967>Ordering from the Soul Scrolls is a sign of devotion and loyalty to the regime, so naturally, the Ladies continuously place orders.</t3967> <t3968>It benefits their husbands' career advancement.</t3968>
<t3969>There are five different prayer contents: health, wealth, death, childbirth, and forgiveness.</t3969> <t3970>Select the one you need, enter the number, then enter your code to charge to your account, and enter the number of times you want to repeat the prayer.</t3970>
<t3971>The machines talk to each other while printing; if you want, you can go in and listen, the toneless metallic voice repeating only one thing.</t3971> <t3972>When the prayer is printed and read, the paper is rolled into another slot to be recycled into white paper.</t3972> <t3973>There is no one in here: the machines run automatically.</t3973> <t3974>Standing outside, you can't hear the voices; they merge into a hum, a murmur, like a devout crowd, kneeling.</t3974> <t3975>On the side of each machine, a golden eye is drawn, with two small golden wings waving.</t3975>
<t3976>I try to remember what was sold here when there were still goods, before it became the Soul Tome.</t3976> <t3977>It seems like it was women's underwear.</t3977>
<t3978>Stacks of pink and silver boxes, colorful tights, lace-trimmed bras, silk scarves?</t3978> <t3979>Those things are no more.</t3979>
<t3980>Ofglen and I stand outside the Soul Scrolls, looking through the bulletproof glass, watching the prayer rolls come out of the machine and then disappear back into the slot, returning to the realm of unspoken words.</t3980> <t3981>I look away.</t3981> <t3982>No longer looking at the machine, I see Ofglen, reflected in the glass door.</t3982> <t3983>She is staring straight at me.</t3983>
<t3984>We looked directly into each other's eyes.</t3984> <t3985>This was the first time I saw Ofglen's face, directly, calmly, not just a sideways glance.</t3985> <t3986>An oval face, rosy, chubby but not fat, with slightly round eyes.</t3986>
<t3987>She looked back through the glass, calm and unafraid.</t3987> <t3988>Now it's hard to look away.</t3988> <t3989>Looking like this causes some dizziness: like seeing someone else's naked body for the first time.</t3989> <t3990>Suddenly, a danger, unprecedented, hovered between us.</t3990> <t3991>Just making eye contact like this was already risky.</t3991> <t3992>Even though no one was around here.</t3992>
<t3993>Finally, Ofglen opened her mouth.</t3993> <t3994>"Do you think God really listens," she said, "to these machines?" She was whispering: an old habit from the Center.</t3994>
<t3995>In the past, this would have been just a trivial remark, an academic assumption.</t3995> <t3996>Now it is treacherous.</t3996>
<t3997>I could scream.</t3997> <t3998>I could run away.</t3998> <t3999>I could quietly turn away, making it clear that I do not allow such talk in my presence.</t3999> <t4000>Overthrow, agitation, blasphemy, heresy, all are packed into that sentence.</t4000>
<t4001>I shrank back. "No," I said.</t4001>
<t4002>She let out a sigh of relief.</t4002> <t4003>We had crossed the invisible boundary together.</t4003> <t4004>“Me neither,” she said.</t4004>
<t4005>“Though I think it is faith, a special kind,” I said.</t4005> <t4006>“Like the prayer wheel in Tibet.”</t4006>
<t4007>“What is it?” she asked.</t4007>
<t4008>“I also just read it in books,” I said.</t4008> <t4009>“They turn thanks to the wind.</t4009> <t4010>Now they are no more.”</t4010>
<t4011>"Nothing is left," she said.</t4011> <t4012>Only then did we look away from each other.</t4012>
<t4013>"Is it safe here?" I whispered.</t4013>
<t4014>“I think this is the safest place,” she said.</t4014> <t4015>“We look like we are praying, that's all.</t4015><t4016>”</t4016>
<t4017>“What about them?”</t4017>
<t4018>“Them?” she said, still whispering. “The safest place is out on the street, no bugs, so why would they have to plant one here?</t4018> <t4019>They probably think no one would dare.</t4019> <t4020>But we've been here too long. It's not good to be late.”</t4020> <t4021>We turned away together. “Remember to keep your head down when walking,” she said, “and lean slightly towards me.</t4021> <t4022>That way I can hear you better.</t4022> <t4023>Don't speak when someone is near.</t4023><t4024>”</t4024>
<t4025>We continued walking, heads bowed low as always.</t4025> <t4026>I was so nervous I could hardly breathe, but I kept my pace steady.</t4026> <t4027>More than ever, I had to avoid drawing attention at this moment.</t4027>
<t4028>"I thought you were very religious," Ofglen said.</t4028>
<t4029>“I thought it was her,” I said.</t4029>
<t4030>"She's always so devout, it's nauseating."</t4030><t4031></t4031>
<t4032>“So are you,” I replied.</t4032> <t4033>I wanted to laugh, to scream, to hug her tightly.</t4033>
<t4034>"You can join our group," she said.</t4034>
<t4035>“A club?” I said.</t4035> <t4036>So there is a club, so there is us.</t4036> <t4037>I knew it.</t4037>
<t4038>“You don't think I'm alone, do you?” she said.</t4038>
<t4039>I don't think so.</t4039> <t4040>There is still a risk that she is a spy, an agent, planted to trap me; that's the kind of land we grew up on.</t4040> <t4041>But I can't believe it; hope rises within me, like sap in the veins of a tree.</t4041> <t4042>Like blood oozing from a wound.</t4042> <t4043>That we have just opened.</t4043>
<t4044>I want to ask if she has met Moira, if anyone can help find the whereabouts of Luke, my child, or even my mother, but there isn't enough time; just a few more steps to the main street corner, right before the first barrier.</t4044> <t4045>There will be too many people passing by.</t4045>
<t4046>"Don't let a word slip," Ofglen threatened, though it was really unnecessary.</t4046> <t4047>"By any means."</t4047>
<t4048>"Of course," I said.</t4048> <t4049>Who else would I be talking to?</t4049>
<t4050>We silently walked along the main street, past Lily, past Flesh.</t4050> <t4051>The sidewalk this afternoon was busier than usual: the warm weather had driven everyone outside.</t4051> <t4052>Women: green, blue, red, striped; men too, some in uniforms, some just in plain clothes.</t4052> <t4053>The sun was giving out free rays, and it was still free to enjoy them.</t4053> <t4054>Even though no one sunbathes anymore, at least not in crowded places.</t4054>
<t4055>There are also more cars, with the Gale having a driver and the boss comfortably seated on a cushion, while the more inferior cars are in the hands of inferior people.</t4055>
<t4056>Something happened: suddenly the line of cars became chaotic, suddenly there was a commotion.</t4056> <t4057>Some pulled over to the side, as if to clear the way.</t4057> <t4058>I quickly looked up: a black van, with a white eye painted on its side.</t4058> <t4059>It didn't blare its horn, but the other cars still automatically moved away.</t4059> <t4060>It crawled slowly on the road, as if searching for something: a shark hunting its prey.</t4060>
<t4061>I froze, my whole body turning cold, all the way down to my feet.</t4061> <t4062>They must have planted a bug; they heard everything we said.</t4062>
<t4063>Ofglen grabs my elbow, her sleeve covering it.</t4063> <t4064>"Keep going," she whispers.</t4064> <t4065>"Just pretend you don't see."</t4065>
<t4066>But I couldn't help but see.</t4066> <t4067>Right in front of us, the car stopped. Two Eyes, in gray clothes, jumped out of the car's rear door.</t4067> <t4068>They grabbed a man walking on the street, carrying a briefcase, a completely ordinary-looking person, and slammed him hard against the unpainted side of the car.</t4068> <t4069>He hung there for a moment, his body pressed against the side of the car, then one of the Eyes approached and delivered a heavy and brutal blow that doubled him over, turning him into a crumpled heap of clothes.</t4069> <t4070>They lifted him up and tossed him into the car like a parcel.</t4070> <t4071>Then they also got in, the door closed, and the car slowly crawled away.</t4071>
<t4072>The scene was over, in just a few seconds, the streets continued as if nothing had happened.</t4072>
<t4073>My feeling is one of relief.</t4073> <t4074>It's not me.</t4074>
<t4075>28</t4075>
<t4076>This afternoon, I don't feel like taking a nap at all; the blood in my veins is still pounding.</t4076> <t4077>I sit on the windowsill, looking outside through the semi-transparent curtain.</t4077> <t4078>The white nightgown.</t4078> <t4079>The door is pushed wide open, the gust of wind blowing in, hot with the scent of sunlight, the white fabric brushing across my face.</t4079> <t4080>From the outside looking in, I probably appear like a cocoon, a large ghostly figure, face covered with a shroud, faintly showing some features, the bridge of the nose, the mouth wrapped in bandages, eyes unseen.</t4080> <t4081>But I like this feeling, like the soft fabric gently brushing against my skin.</t4081> <t4082>As if I were in the middle of a cloud.</t4082>
<t4083>They gave a small electric fan, it's needed in this humid weather.</t4083> <t4084>It hummed on the floor, in the corner, the fan blades trapped within the iron frame.</t4084> <t4085>Moira would have known how to take it apart, leaving only the sharp edges.</t4085> <t4086>No screwdriver, but Moira would have done it without a screwdriver.</t4086> <t4087>I'm not Moira.</t4087>
<t4088>What would she say about the Commander if she were here?</t4088> <t4089>Almost certainly, she would not be pleased.</t4089> <t4090>She was not pleased with Luke back then.</t4090> <t4091>Not because of Luke, but because he was married.</t4091> <t4092>She said I was encroaching on another woman's territory.</t4092> <t4093>I said Luke was not a fish or a piece of land; he was a person who could decide for himself.</t4093> <t4094>She said I was making excuses.</t4094> <t4095>I said I was in love.</t4095> <t4096>She said that was no excuse.</t4096> <t4097>Moira was always more rational than I was.</t4097>
<t4098>I said that she no longer had that problem because she had chosen to only like women, and from what I could see, she didn't hesitate to steal or borrow them whenever she felt like it.</t4098> <t4099>She said that was different because the balance of power between women is equal, so sex is a fair and honorable transaction.</t4099> <t4100>I said her very words were gender-biased, if she liked to put it that way, and anyway, this topic was already old.</t4100> <t4101>She said I was underestimating the issue and if I thought it was old, then I was just an ostrich with its head in the sand.</t4101>
<t4102>That conversation took place in my kitchen, coffee in hand, we sat by the table, speaking softly and passionately like every other debate we had just past our twenties, remnants of our university days.</t4102> <t4103>The kitchen was in a dilapidated apartment in a wooden house near the river, the kind with three floors and a rear staircase that shook violently when used.</t4103> <t4104>I lived on the second floor, the spot that absorbed noise from both above and below, with two uninvited music tracks thumping until late at night.</t4104> <t4105>All students, I knew.</t4105> <t4106>I was still at my first job, the salary wasn't great: I managed a computer in an insurance company.</t4106> <t4107>So hotels, with Luke included, were not just about love for me, not even just about sex.</t4107> <t4108>They were also about time without interruptions, without a dripping sink, without peeling linoleum, and without personal efforts to beautify life with wall posters and stained glass hanging in the windows.</t4108> <t4109>I even grew plants, though sooner or later they would become spider egg nests or wither from lack of water.</t4109> <t4110>I went out with Luke, leaving the plants to be forgotten.</t4110>
<t4111>I said that there is not just one type of ostrich, and if Moira thinks she can build a paradise by isolating herself in some kind of matriarchy, she is sadly mistaken.</t4111> <t4112>Men simply will not disappear, I said.</t4112> <t4113>You can't just ignore them and be done with it.</t4113>
<t4114>Saying that is like telling you to go out and catch syphilis just because it exists, Moira said.</t4114>
<t4115>You said Luke is a social disease? I said.</t4115>
<t4116>Moira laughed loudly.</t4116> <t4117>What are we talking about, she said.</t4117> <t4118>Damn it. Just like your mother.</t4118>
<t4119>So the two of us laughed together, and when she left, we hugged goodbye as usual.</t4119> <t4120>There was a time we didn't hug, when she first revealed she was gay; but then she said I didn't excite her, reassured me, and we went back to our old habit.</t4120> <t4121>We did shout and use all sorts of words, but inside nothing changed.</t4121> <t4122>She is still the same, my old friend.</t4122>
<t4123>She is my old friend.</t4123>
<t4124>Then I moved to a nicer apartment, living through the two years it took for Luke to free himself.</t4124> <t4125>I paid the rent myself, with the salary from my new job.</t4125> <t4126>At a library, not the grand one with Death and Victory, but a smaller place.</t4126>
<t4127>I do the task of inputting books into computer disks, reducing storage volume as well as replacement costs, as they instructed.</t4127>
<t4128>We called ourselves the leeches.</t4128> <t4129>And we called the library the leech nest, to laugh among ourselves.</t4129> <t4130>Once the books were processed, they were supposed to go into the document shredder, but sometimes I took them home.</t4130> <t4131>I liked the feeling of touching them, liked looking at them.</t4131> <t4132>Luke said I had the mindset of an antique collector.</t4132> <t4133>He liked it, he himself also liked old things.</t4133>
<t4134>How strange it is, now, when thinking about having gone to work.</t4134> <t4135>Work. A really odd word. Men work.</t4135> <t4136>Go potty, adults say to children learning to use the toilet.</t4136> <t4137>Or dogs: it made a mess on the carpet again.</t4137> <t4138>You have to roll up the newspaper and hit it, my mother said.</t4138> <t4139>I still remember the time when there were newspapers, even though I never had a dog, only cats.</t4139>
<t4140>Who dares to ask Him: "What are you doing?" In the book of Job.</t4140>
<t4141>So many women working: it's hard to imagine now, but thousands used to work, millions.</t4141><t4142>That was common back then.</t4142><t4143>Now, remembering that is like recalling paper money, from the time it was still in circulation.</t4143><t4144>Mom still keeps some, pasted in an album along with photos from her youth.</t4144><t4145>By then, paper money was no longer in use, it couldn't buy anything.</t4145><t4146>Those square, thick, spongy pieces of paper, sticky to the touch, colored green, with images on both sides, some old man in a wig on one side, and a pyramid with an eye at the top on the other.</t4146><t4147>It had "In God We Trust" written on it.</t4147><t4148>Mom said people used to stick them on cash registers as a joke: "In God we trust, all others pay cash."</t4148><t4149>Now that would be considered blasphemous.</t4149>
<t4150>We had to carry those pieces when going shopping, although by the time I was about nine or ten, people were already using plastic cards.</t4150> <t4151>Fruits and vegetables were still not included, that came later.</t4151> <t4152>It was so ancient, even primitive, like shell money.</t4152> <t4153>I probably used that kind of money too, for a while, before everything switched to computer chips.</t4153>
<t4154>Now I see that it was precisely because of that they were able to do it, in that way, all of a sudden, without anyone anticipating it.</t4154> <t4155>If they still had money to carry with them, it would definitely be more difficult.</t4155>
<t4156>The incident happened after the catastrophe, the president was shot and machine guns fired into the Parliament, the military declared a state of emergency.</t4156> <t4157>The responsibility was placed on the extreme Islamic group at that time.</t4157>
<t4158>Stay calm, the TV said.</t4158> <t4159>Everything is under control.</t4159>
<t4160>I was stunned.</t4160> <t4161>The people were stunned, I knew.</t4161> <t4162>Unbelievable.</t4162> <t4163>The entire government, vanished in the blink of an eye.</t4163> <t4164>How did they get in, how could it be?</t4164>
<t4165>That was when the Constitution was suspended.</t4165> <t4166>They said it was only temporary.</t4166> <t4167>There wasn't even any violence in the streets.</t4167> <t4168>People stayed in their homes at night, turned on the TV, waiting for direction.</t4168> <t4169>There wasn't even an enemy to name and blame.</t4169>
<t4170>Open your eyes and watch, Moira told me over the phone.</t4170> <t4171>It's starting now.</t4171>
<t4172>Start what? I asked.</t4172>
<t4173>Just wait and see, she said.</t4173> <t4174>This has been building up for a long time.</t4174> <t4175>Now you and I are backed into a corner, darling.</t4175> <t4176>She was repeating my mother's favorite saying, but without any hint of jest.</t4176>
<t4177>The state of stagnation lasted for several weeks, although some things did happen.</t4177> <t4178>The press was censored, several newspapers were shut down, for security reasons, according to the official statement.</t4178> <t4179>Checkpoints began to appear, along with travel ID cards.</t4179> <t4180>Everyone complied, as it was clearly better to be safe than sorry.</t4180> <t4181>It was said that there would be a re-election, but it was also said that some preparation time was needed.</t4181> <t4182>The task for everyone, they said, was to continue as usual.</t4182>
<t4183>But the sex toy supermarkets were also shut down, and the Love trucks that used to wander around the Square disappeared as well.</t4183> <t4184>However, I don't regret it.</t4184> <t4185>Everyone knows how troublesome they were.</t4185>
<t4186>Clearly, it's time for someone to do something, that was the opinion of the woman behind the counter at the store where I usually buy cigarettes.</t4186> <t4187>The store is at the corner of the street, a small newsstand: magazines, cigarettes, candy.</t4187> <t4188>She is elderly, her hair has turned gray, belonging to my mother's generation.</t4188>
<t4189>Do they just clear them away, or what?</t4189> <t4190>I asked.</t4190>
<t4191>She shrugged.</t4191> <t4192>Who knows, who cares, she said.</t4192> <t4193>Maybe just moving them somewhere else.</t4193> <t4194>Trying to get rid of them completely is like trying to stomp out rats, you understand?</t4194> <t4195>She entered my computer code into the machine without even looking: I'm a regular customer.</t4195> <t4196>People are complaining, she said.</t4196>
<t4197>The next morning, on my way to the library for work, I stopped by there again to buy more packs, as I had run out.</t4197> <t4198>Lately, I've been smoking more, due to the tension, which feels like it could explode, like a rumbling sound underground, even though things seem very quiet.</t4198> <t4199>I've also been drinking more coffee, making it hard to sleep at night.</t4199> <t4200>Everyone is a bit restless.</t4200>
<t4201>The station plays much more music and talks less.</t4201>
<t4202>By then we were already married, it had been a year or so; our child was already three or four years old and attending daycare.</t4202>
<t4203>We woke up as usual, had breakfast - baked oatmeal, I still remember, and Luke drove the child, wearing the tiny outfit I had bought a few weeks ago, striped overalls with a blue t-shirt.</t4203> <t4204>What month was it?</t4204> <t4205>It must have been September.</t4205> <t4206>The school had a bus service, but for some reason, I wanted Luke to drive the child, now I even worry about the school bus.</t4206> <t4207>Children no longer go to school on their own, there have been too many disappearances.</t4207>
<t4208>When I arrived at the corner store, I didn't see the usual shopkeeper lady.</t4208> <t4209>Instead, there was a young man, looking no older than twenty.</t4209>
<t4210>Is she sick? I asked as I handed out the card.</t4210>
<t4211>"Huh?" he asked, I felt a bit confrontational.</t4211>
<t4212>She still sells here, I said.</t4212>
<t4213>How could I know, he said.</t4213> <t4214>He was entering my code, fumbling with each number, typing with one finger.</t4214> <t4215>Clearly, he had never done this before.</t4215> <t4216>I tapped my fingers on the counter, impatiently waiting for a cigarette, idly wondering if anyone had ever shown him how to deal with the pimples on his neck.</t4216> <t4217>I still remember clearly what he looked like: tall, slightly hunched, short black hair, brown eyes that seemed to focus only five centimeters below my nose, and that skin condition.</t4217> <t4218>I probably remember so well because of what he said right after that.</t4218>
<t4219>Sorry, he said.</t4219> <t4220>This number is not valid.</t4220>
<t4221>Absurd, I said.</t4221> <t4222>Why is it invalid? My account still has thousands.</t4222> <t4223>I just received the statement the day before yesterday.</t4223> <t4224>Try again.</t4224>
<t4225>Invalid number, he repeated persistently.</t4225> <t4226>Do you see the red light?</t4226> <t4227>It means invalid.</t4227>
<t4228>You must have typed it wrong, I said.</t4228> <t4229>Try again.</t4229>
<t4230>He shrugged and smiled wearily, but still entered it again.</t4230> <t4231>This time I watched each finger, on each key, checking the number displayed on the screen.</t4231> <t4232>It was indeed my code, but the red light remained red.</t4232>
<t4233>See? He repeated, still with that same smile, as if he knew a secret prank that he didn't intend to share with me.</t4233>
<t4234>When I get to the office, I'll call them, I said.</t4234> <t4235>The system had malfunctioned before as well, but usually, one or two phone calls would sort it out.</t4235> <t4236>But anyway, I was furious, as if I had been unjustly accused of something I didn't even know about.</t4236> <t4237>As if I were the one who made the mistake.</t4237>
<t4238>Go ahead, he said indifferently.</t4238> <t4239>I left the pack of cigarettes on the counter, I didn't pay for it.</t4239> <t4240>I'm sure I can ask a colleague for some.</t4240>
<t4241>When I got to the office, I called for real, but only reached an answering machine.</t4241> <t4242>The line is overloaded, the recorded message said.</t4242> <t4243>Could you please call back later?</t4243>
<t4244>The line was overloaded all morning, as far as I could see.</t4244> <t4245>I tried calling back a few times, but it didn't work.</t4245> <t4246>That kind of thing isn't too unusual either.</t4246>
<t4247>Around two o'clock, after lunch, the director entered the disk input room.</t4247>
<t4248>I have something to tell you, he said.</t4248> <t4249>He looked very miserable: his hair was messy, his eyes were bloodshot, as if he had just been drinking.</t4249>
<t4250>We all looked up, turning off all the machines.</t4250> <t4251>The room had about eight or ten people in total.</t4251>
<t4252>I'm very sorry, he said, but this is the law.</t4252> <t4253>I am truly very, very sorry.</t4253>
<t4254>Because of what? Someone spoke up.</t4254>
<t4255>I am forced to let you go, he said.</t4255> <t4256>This is the law, I am forced to do so.</t4256> <t4257>I have to let all of you go.</t4257> <t4258>He spoke almost gently, as if we were wild animals, frogs he had caught and kept in a jar, as if he were doing us a favor with a delicate touch.</t4258>
<t4259>Are we being kicked out? I asked.</t4259> <t4260>I stood up.</t4260> <t4261>But why?</t4261>
<t4262>Not being fired, he said.</t4262> <t4263>Letting go. You ladies can't work here anymore, it's the law.</t4263> <t4264>He ran his hand through his hair and I thought, This man is crazy.</t4264> <t4265>The stress had crushed him, causing him to snap.</t4265>
<t4266>"You can't just say that and be done with it," the woman sitting next to me said.</t4266> <t4267>Those words echoed out of place, inappropriate, like a line from a television show.</t4267>
<t4268>It's not my fault, he said.</t4268> <t4269>You don't understand.</t4269> <t4270>Please go, go right away.</t4270> <t4271>His voice rose.</t4271> <t4272>I don't want any trouble.</t4272> <t4273>If there's trouble, the books might be lost, everything will be ruined...</t4273> <t4274>He looked back.</t4274> <t4275>They're out there, he said, in my room.</t4275> <t4276>If you don't leave right now, they will come in here themselves.</t4276> <t4277>They only gave me ten minutes.</t4277> <t4278>By now, he seemed extremely frantic.</t4278>
<t4279>This man is crazy, someone shouted; it's probably what we all thought.</t4279>
<t4280>But I sat in a spot that looked straight out into the hallway, and saw two people standing there, dressed in military uniforms, carrying machine guns.</t4280> <t4281>It was like a stage, it couldn't be real, yet it was real: ghosts suddenly appearing, Martians descending.</t4281> <t4282>They appeared as if in a dream; they were too vivid, too contrary to the surrounding scenery.</t4282>
<t4283>Just leave the machine there, he said as we were packing up, streaming out.</t4283> <t4284>As if we could take everything with us.</t4284>
<t4285>We huddled together on the steps outside the library.</t4285> <t4286>We didn't know what to say to each other.</t4286> <t4287>Since no one really understood what was happening, we had nothing to say.</t4287> <t4288>We looked at each other, only seeing anxiety and shame, as if we had been caught doing something forbidden.</t4288>
<t4289>It's truly outrageous, one person said, without entirely believing what they were saying.</t4289> <t4290>Why do we all feel that we deserve this situation?</t4290>
<t4291>When I got home, the house was silent.</t4291> <t4292>Luke was still at work, the child at school.</t4292> <t4293>I was exhausted, utterly drained, but after sitting down, I stood up again; I couldn't sit still.</t4293> <t4294>I wandered around the house, from room to room.</t4294> <t4295>I remember touching many things, not intentionally, just lightly brushing my fingers; perhaps the toaster, the sugar bowl, the living room ashtray.</t4295> <t4296>After a while, I picked up the cat and held it.</t4296> <t4297>I wanted Luke to come home.</t4297> <t4298>I thought I should do something, take some action, but I didn't know what it could be.</t4298>
<t4299>I tried calling the bank again, but still heard the same old recording.</t4299> <t4300>I poured myself a glass of milk - telling myself that I was too jittery to have more coffee - and went into the living room, sat down on the sofa, and placed the glass of milk on the coffee table, very gently, without taking a sip.</t4300> <t4301>I hugged the cat tightly to hear it purr close to my throat.</t4301>
<t4302>A moment later, I called my mother's apartment again, but no one picked up.</t4302> <t4303>By that year, my mother had become more settled, no longer moving every few years; she lived across the river, in Boston.</t4303> <t4304>I waited a little longer and then called Moira.</t4304> <t4305>She wasn't home either, but she called back half an hour later.</t4305> <t4306>Between the phone calls, I just sat on the chair.</t4306> <t4307>In my mind was my child's school lunch.</t4307> <t4308>I felt that lately, I had been making too many peanut butter sandwiches for my child.</t4308>
<t4309>I've been fired, I told Moira when I finally managed to reach her.</t4309> <t4310>She said she would come over right away.</t4310> <t4311>At that time, she was working for a women's organization, in the publishing department.</t4311> <t4312>They published books about contraception, rape, and things like that, although there wasn't as much demand for them as there used to be.</t4312>
<t4313>I'll come over right away, she said.</t4313> <t4314>She probably guessed from my tone that it was something I needed.</t4314>
<t4315>A moment later she arrived.</t4315> <t4316>How are you, she said.</t4316> <t4317>She took off her outer coat, sat sprawled in the oversized chair. Tell me.</t4317> <t4318>Let's have a drink first.</t4318>
<t4319>She stood up, went to the kitchen, and made two glasses of Scotch, then came back and sat down, and I tried to explain what had happened.</t4319> <t4320>When I finished telling her, she asked, "Have you tried buying anything with the Computer Card today?"</t4320>
<t4321>Then, I spoke.</t4321> <t4322>I told that story right away.</t4322>
<t4323>They have frozen the accounts.</t4323> <t4324>Mine too. The association's too.</t4324> <t4325>Any that had the word Female instead of Male. It was all just a few button presses.</t4325> <t4326>We were let go.</t4326>
<t4327>But I have more than two thousand dollars in there, I said, as if my account was the only issue worth discussing.</t4327>
<t4328>Women no longer have the right to own property, she said.</t4328> <t4329>That's the new law.</t4329> <t4330>Have you turned on the TV today?</t4330>
<t4331>No, I said.</t4331>
<t4332>It did speak, she said.</t4332> <t4333>Everywhere it spoke.</t4333> <t4334>She wasn't dizzy, like me.</t4334> <t4335>She seemed oddly pleased, as if she had been expecting this for a long time and now see, she had told you so.</t4335> <t4336>She looked more excited, more determined than usual.</t4336> <t4337>Luke can use your Computer Account, she said.</t4337> <t4338>They will transfer your code to him, at least that's what they said.</t4338> <t4339>Husband or nearest male relative.</t4339>
<t4340>What about you?</t4340> <t4341>I asked.</t4341> <t4342>She doesn't have anyone.</t4342>
<t4343>I'll go underground, she said.</t4343> <t4344>Among the homosexuals, there will be someone who will take the code and buy the things we need.</t4344>
<t4345>But why? I asked.</t4345> <t4346>Why is it like that?</t4346>
<t4347>It's not our business to discuss it, Moira said.</t4347> <t4348>They need to do it, both the accounts and the work, at the same time.</t4348> <t4349>Otherwise, just imagine the airport?</t4349> <t4350>They don't want us to go anywhere, I bet.</t4350>
<t4351>I went to school to pick up my child. I drove excessively cautiously.</t4351> <t4352>When Luke got home, I was already sitting at the kitchen table.</t4352> <t4353>My child was drawing with markers at a tiny table in the corner of the room, creating pictures that would later be stuck up next to the refrigerator.</t4353>
<t4354>Luke knelt down beside me and hugged me.</t4354> <t4355>I heard it, he said, in the car, on the way back.</t4355> <t4356>Don't worry too much, I'm sure it's only temporary.</t4356>
<t4357>Did they say why?</t4357> <t4358>I asked.</t4358>
<t4359>He didn't answer.</t4359> <t4360>We'll get through this, he said, holding me tightly.</t4360>
<t4361>You don't understand what it feels like, I said.</t4361> <t4362>I feel like someone has cut off both of my feet.</t4362> <t4363>I didn't cry.</t4363> <t4364>But I couldn't hug you back either.</t4364>
<t4365>It's just a job, he said, trying to comfort me.</t4365>
<t4366>I'm sure you'll get all my money, I said.</t4366> <t4367>And I'm not even dead yet.</t4367> <t4368>I tried to joke, but it sounded rather eerie.</t4368>
<t4369>Don't say that, he said.</t4369> <t4370>He was still kneeling on the floor.</t4370> <t4371>You know I will always take care of you.</t4371>
<t4372>I think, He already wants to act like an elder to me.</t4372> <t4373>Then I think, You're already getting scared.</t4373>
<t4374>I'm sorry, I said.</t4374> <t4375>I love you.</t4375>
<t4376>Then, when you had gone to bed and we were having dinner, when I was no longer trembling so much, I recounted the afternoon to him.</t4376> <t4377>I described the director entering the room, blurting out the announcement.</t4377> <t4378>If it hadn't been so frightening, it would have been very funny, I said.</t4378> <t4379>I thought he was drunk.</t4379> <t4380>He might actually have been drunk.</t4380> <t4381>There were also the military and all sorts of other things.</t4381>
<t4382>Then I remembered something I had seen but not noticed at the time.</t4382> <t4383>It wasn't the national army.</t4383> <t4384>It was another army.</t4384>
<t4385>There were protests, of course, many women with a few men.</t4385> <t4386>But the scale was much smaller than imagined.</t4386> <t4387>Perhaps people were terrified.</t4387> <t4388>And when it became clear that the police, or the army, or whatever that group was called, would open fire almost immediately as the crowd began to take to the streets, the protesters gave up.</t4388> <t4389>Some places were bombed, the post office, the subway station.</t4389> <t4390>But it was still uncertain who was responsible.</t4390> <t4391>It could have been the army itself, to have an excuse to search the computers and search beyond the computers, house by house.</t4391>
<t4392>I did not participate in any protests.</t4392> <t4393>Luke said it was a waste of time and that I had to think about everyone, my family, him, and our child.</t4393> <t4394>I thought about my family.</t4394> <t4395>I started cleaning more, baking more. I tried not to cry when mealtime came.</t4395> <t4396>Lately, I have started crying often, suddenly, and sitting by the bedroom window, staring out aimlessly.</t4396> <t4397>I don't know many neighbors, and when we meet on the street, we are careful not to exchange more than common greetings.</t4397> <t4398>No one wants to be reported, accused of disloyalty.</t4398>
<t4399>Remembering this, I also recall my mother, many years ago.</t4399> <t4400>It must have been around when I was fourteen or fifteen, the age when girls are most easily embarrassed by their mothers.</t4400> <t4401>I remember my mother returning to some apartment, one of the countless places we had lived, with a group of other women, among the ever-changing faces of her friends.</t4401> <t4402>That day they had just returned from a protest; it was during the anti-pornography or anti-abortion riots, both of which were closely related.</t4402> <t4403>Bombings everywhere: clinics, video stores; hard to remember exactly.</t4403>
<t4404>There were bruises and a bit of blood on my mother's face.</t4404> <t4405>You can't stick your hand through the glass without getting cut, my mother remarked curtly.</t4405> <t4406>Damn those pigs.</t4406>
<t4407>Oh mother, the bloodsuckers, one of the friends said.</t4407> <t4408>They called the other side the bloodsuckers, because of their banner: Let them bleed. So it must be about the abortion issue.</t4408>
<t4409>I went into the bedroom, avoiding them.</t4409> <t4410>They talked too much, too noisily.</t4410> <t4411>They ignored me, and I hated them.</t4411> <t4412>Both my mother and her rude friends.</t4412> <t4413>I really don't understand why my mother has to dress like that, in overalls, as if she's still very young, and why she has to swear all the time.</t4413>
<t4414>You're just like a turtle hiding in its shell, my mother often told me, her tone actually quite satisfied.</t4414> <t4415>My mother liked to appear more daring, more rebellious than I was.</t4415> <t4416>Teenagers are always like turtles hiding in their shells.</t4416>
<t4417>One reason I am not satisfied with my mother is because of that, I know: formula, habit.</t4417> <t4418>But besides that, I also hope my mother can give me a more proper life, less temporary and wandering.</t4418>
<t4419>You were born out of desire, witnessed by God, at other times mother would say, lingering through each album page helping her frame me; those albums densely packed with baby pictures, but my copies thinned out as I grew, like the inhabitants of that twin river country who had to endure a plague.</t4419> <t4420>Mother's voice then often had a tinge of regret, as if in the end I turned out not quite as she had hoped.</t4420> <t4421>No mother is exactly, one hundred percent, the child's idea of a mother, and I suppose the reverse is also true.</t4421> <t4422>But despite everything, we lived together not too badly, quite as well as most other pairs.</t4422>
<t4423>I wish my mother were here, to tell her that I finally understand it.</t4423>
<t4424>Someone has left the house.</t4424> <t4425>I heard the door closing in the distance, from the side wall, the sound of footsteps on the entrance path.</t4425> <t4426>It's Nick, now I see: he steps off the path, treads on the grass, inhales the damp air reeking of various flowers, the scent of fruit flesh, the pollen scattering in handfuls into the wind, like clam eggs spraying into the ocean.</t4426> <t4427>How wildly the seeds are sown.</t4427> <t4428>He stretches in the sunlight, I can feel the muscles moving down his body, like a cat arching its back.</t4428> <t4429>He is wearing only a shirt, his bare arms brazenly emerging from the rolled-up sleeves.</t4429> <t4430>Where does the tan end?</t4430> <t4431>I haven't spoken to him since that one night, the dream-like night in the moonlit rest room.</t4431> <t4432>He is just a flag, a signal to me.</t4432> <t4433>Body language.</t4433>
<t4434>At this moment, your hat is askew.</t4434> <t4435>That means I am being summoned.</t4435>
<t4436>What did he get in return for this errand boy job?</t4436> <t4437>What did he think when he took on this extremely ambiguous role as a go-between for the Leader?</t4437> <t4438>Did he feel disgusted, or did he want more from me, want me more?</t4438> <t4439>Because he couldn't know what was really happening there, among the stacks of books.</t4439> <t4440>Monkey tricks, that's all he could guess.</t4440> <t4441>The Leader and I, covering each other in ink, licking it all off, or making love on piles of banned newspapers.</t4441> <t4442>That wouldn't be too far off.</t4442>
<t4443>But think about it, he must gain something.</t4443> <t4444>Everyone is making a profit, one way or another.</t4444> <t4445>An extra ration of cigarettes, perhaps?</t4445> <t4446>Extra freedom, which is not meant for the ordinary folks?</t4446> <t4447>But anyway, what does he prove?</t4447> <t4448>It's just his word against the Commander's, unless he brings in the special forces.</t4448> <t4449>Kicking the door open, didn't I tell you? Caught red-handed, playing the sinful Scrabble.</t4449> <t4450>Hurry up, swallow all the letters.</t4450>
<t4451>Maybe he was just delighted because he knew a secret.</t4451> <t4452>He had something on me, as people often say.</t4452> <t4453>That kind of power can only be used once.</t4453>
<t4454>I really want to think better of him.</t4454>
<t4455>That night, the night I lost my job, Luke wanted us to make love.</t4455> <t4456>Why did I refuse?</t4456> <t4457>If it were just despair, it would have driven me to do it.</t4457> <t4458>But I felt paralyzed.</t4458> <t4459>Almost didn't feel his hand on me.</t4459>
<t4460>How are you? he asked.</t4460>
<t4461>I don't know, I said.</t4461>
<t4462>We still have... he said.</t4462> <t4463>But he didn't finish saying what we still have.</t4463> <t4464>I suddenly thought that he shouldn't say "we," because as far as I could see, he hadn't lost anything at all.</t4464>
<t4465>We still have each other, I said.</t4465> <t4466>And it's true. So why do my words still ring out, even in my own ears, so indifferent?</t4466>
<t4467>Then he kissed me, as if I had said that, everything would be normal again as before.</t4467> <t4468>But something had shifted, a balance had tipped.</t4468> <t4469>I felt myself shrinking, and when he wrapped his arms around me, pulling me close, I was as small as a doll.</t4469> <t4470>I felt love passing by, I stood still.</t4470>
<t4471>He doesn't mind that, I think.</t4471> <t4472>Not at all.</t4472> <t4473>Maybe he even likes it.</t4473> <t4474>We are no longer each other's.</t4474> <t4475>Now, I am his.</t4475>
<t4476>Undeserving, unfair, incorrect.</t4476> <t4477>But that's how it is.</t4477>
<t4478>Hey Luke: what I want to ask you now, what I need to know, is: Do I think this is right?</t4478> <t4479>Because we have never talked about it.</t4479> <t4480>Back when we could talk, I was scared.</t4480> <t4481>I couldn't risk losing you.</t4481>
<t4482>29</t4482>
<t4483>I am sitting in the Commander's room, at the table opposite him, in the position of a client, like someone negotiating a significant loan at a bank.</t4483> <t4484>But aside from my seat, there are few traces of formality between the two of us.</t4484> <t4485>I no longer sit with a stiff neck, back straight, feet frozen together on the floor, eyes downcast.</t4485> <t4486>Now I relax my whole body, feeling quite comfortable.</t4486> <t4487>My shoes have slipped off, I curl my legs up on the chair, surrounded by a fortress of red skirt, but still curled up, like by a campfire, on those distant picnic days.</t4487> <t4488>If there were a fire in the fireplace, it would cast a glittering light on the shiny surfaces of the chairs and table, radiating a warm glow on the skin.</t4488> <t4489>I add the fire myself.</t4489>
<t4490>As for the Commander, tonight, he is excessively relaxed.</t4490> <t4491>His outer shirt is off, with his elbows resting on the table.</t4491> <t4492>All that's missing is a toothpick at the corner of his mouth to complete the image of rural democracy propaganda, like in an old lithograph.</t4492> <t4493>Fly specks dotting the pages, an old book turned to ashes.</t4493>
<t4494>The squares on the chessboard in front of me gradually fill up: I am making the penultimate move tonight.</t4494> <t4495>Zilch3, I place it down, the word with a convenient vowel and a valuable letter Z.</t4495>
<t4496>“Is that also a word?” the commander asked.</t4496>
<t4497>"You can look it up right away," I said.</t4497> <t4498>"This word is quite old."</t4498>
<t4499>“I'll let you have it,” he said.</t4499> <t4500>He laughed.</t4500> <t4501>The commander greatly enjoyed it every time I showed my abilities, talents beyond my age, like an eager puppy, ears perked up, eager to perform.</t4501> <t4502>His approval enveloped me like a warm bath.</t4502> <t4503>From him, I did not sense the hostility I often felt from men, sometimes even from Luke.</t4503> <t4504>In his heart, there was no malice towards me.</t4504> <t4505>In fact, he was kindly paternal.</t4505> <t4506>He delighted in the thought that I was enjoying myself; and oh, wasn't I just.</t4506>
<t4507>Quickly, he calculated the points for both sides on his pocket calculator.</t4507> <t4508>"You are way ahead of me," he said.</t4508> <t4509>I suspected he was cheating, flattering me, wanting to please me.</t4509> <t4510>But why? Still no answer.</t4510> <t4511>What could he gain from this kind of pampering?</t4511> <t4512>There must be something.</t4512>
<t4513>He leaned back, with the tips of his ten fingers touching each other, a gesture I had grown accustomed to.</t4513> <t4514>Between us, a set of gestures had formed, a familiar manner of interaction.</t4514> <t4515>He was looking at me, not without kindness, but with a bit of curiosity, as if I were a puzzle to be solved.</t4515>
<t4516>“What do you want to read today?” he asked.</t4516> <t4517>This too had become a routine.</t4517> <t4518>So far, I had devoured an issue of Mademoiselle, an Esquire from the eighties, an Ms. magazine, which I vaguely remember used to be scattered around my mother's apartments throughout my upbringing, and a Reader’s Digest.</t4518> <t4519>He even had novels.</t4519> <t4520>I had read a Raymond Chandler novel, and now I was halfway through Hard Times, by Charles Dickens.</t4520> <t4521>During those occasions, I read hastily, gobbling up the words, almost skipping, trying to cram as much into my head as possible before the next long fast.</t4521> <t4522>Compared to eating, it would be the scene of someone who had just starved gorging themselves; compared to sex, it would be a quick, furtive stand-up in some alley corner.</t4522>
<t4523>Every time it happened, the Commander would sit and watch me read, not saying a word but never taking his eyes off me.</t4523> <t4524>Even that gaze was a peculiar form of touching; I felt completely exposed.</t4524> <t4525>I wished he would turn his back, walk around the room, and pick something to read on his own.</t4525> <t4526>That way, I might feel more at ease, more relaxed.</t4526> <t4527>As it was, my illicit reading turned into a performance in itself.</t4527>
<t4528>“I think I just want to talk,” I said.</t4528> <t4529>Then I was surprised myself.</t4529>
<t4530>He laughed again.</t4530> <t4531>He did not show any surprise.</t4531> <t4532>Perhaps he had been expecting this, or something similar. "Really?" he said.</t4532> <t4533>"What do you want to talk about?"</t4533>
<t4534>I hesitated. "Anything is fine.</t4534> <t4535>Um, about you, for example.</t4535><t4536>"</t4536>
<t4537>“Me?” He still kept the smile.</t4537> <t4538>“Oh, there's nothing much to say about me.</t4538> <t4539>I'm just an ordinary guy.”</t4539>
<t4540>This blatantly false statement, and the word he used - "thằng cha"? - made me stop abruptly.</t4540> <t4541>Ordinary guys don't become Commanders.</t4541> <t4542>"You must be good at something," I said.</t4542> <t4543>I knew I was prompting, sweet-talking him, seducing, and I felt despicable, a very disgusting act, truly.</t4543> <t4544>But we were both on the defensive.</t4544> <t4545>If he didn't speak, it would be me.</t4545> <t4546>I knew, I could feel the words welling up inside me, how long had it been since I truly conversed with someone.</t4546> <t4547>The fleeting whispers with Ofglen, the walk this morning, didn't amount to much; but they were bait, a prelude.</t4547> <t4548>Having known the relief after just those few words, I wanted more.</t4548>
<t4549>And if I open my mouth in front of him, I will blurt out something I shouldn't say, I will reveal something.</t4549> <t4550>I foresee that this will happen, I will betray myself.</t4550> <t4551>I don't want him to know too much.</t4551>
<t4552>“Ah, I did market research, initially that's what it was,” he said cautiously.</t4552> <t4553>“Then I more or less expanded.”</t4553>
<t4554>I suddenly realized that, although I knew he was the Commander, I didn't know what he was commanding.</t4554> <t4555>His scope, his field of expertise, as people used to say?</t4555> <t4556>Now there are no specific titles anymore.</t4556>
<t4557>"Really," I said, trying to appear understanding.</t4557>
<t4558>“You could say I am somewhat like a scientist,” he said.</t4558> <t4559>“Within limits, of course.</t4559><t4560>”</t4560>
<t4561>After a long while, he didn't say anything, and neither did I.</t4561> <t4562>We were cautious of each other.</t4562>
<t4563>The first person to speak was me. "So, perhaps you could help explain something I've been wondering about for quite a while."</t4563>
<t4564>He seems interesting.</t4564> <t4565>“What could this be?”</t4565>
<t4566>I am charging straight into the penalty area, but I can't stop.</t4566> <t4567>"A sentence I read somewhere." Best not to say where.</t4567> <t4568>"I think it's Latin, and I think maybe..."</t4568> <t4569>I know you have a Latin dictionary.</t4569> <t4570>You have many types of dictionaries, on the top left shelf by the fireplace.</t4570>
<t4571>“Speak,” he said.</t4571> <t4572>More distant, but more attentive, or am I imagining it?</t4572>
<t4573>“Don't let the bastards grind you down,” I said.</t4573>
<t4574>"Huh?" he asked.</t4574>
<t4575>I pronounced it incorrectly.</t4575> <t4576>I don't know how to read it.</t4576> <t4577>"I can spell," I said.</t4577> <t4578>"I can write it down."</t4578>
<t4579>He hesitated for a moment before this novel idea.</t4579> <t4580>Perhaps he doesn't even remember that I know how to write.</t4580> <t4581>I have never held a pen in this room, not even to calculate scores.</t4581> <t4582>Women don't know how to calculate, he once said, as if joking.</t4582> <t4583>When I asked what that meant, he said, They think one plus one plus one plus one is not four.</t4583>
<t4584>So what is it? I asked, thinking it was probably three or five.</t4584>
<t4585>It is still one with one with one with one, he said.</t4585>
<t4586>But at this moment he said, "Alright," and shot the fountain pen across the table towards me almost defiantly, as if accepting a challenge.</t4586> <t4587>I looked around for writing paper and he produced a scorebook, a pad of office notepaper, with a small smiley face printed at the top.</t4587> <t4588>They still make these things.</t4588>
<t4589>I carefully wrote down the words, transcribing them from the depths of my mind, from the bottom of the drawer.</t4589><t4590>Nolite te bastardies carborundorum.</t4590><t4591>Here, in this context, it is no longer a prayer or a command, just a despondent graffiti line, drawn once, then abandoned.</t4591><t4592>The pen between my fingers twitched and quivered, almost alive, I could feel its power, the power of the words within it.</t4592><t4593>The pen breeds envy, Aunt Lydia would say, it was also the motto of the Center, warning us to stay away from such things.</t4593><t4594>And yes, the pen breeds envy. Just holding it makes one envious.</t4594><t4595>I envy the Commander for his pen. Another thing I want to steal.</t4595>
<t4596>The commander took the smiley face paper from my hand and glanced at it.</t4596> <t4597>Then he laughed, and blushed, perhaps?</t4597> <t4598>“This is not proper Latin,” he said.</t4598> <t4599>“It's just a joke.</t4599><t4600>”</t4600>
<t4601>"Joking?" I said, utterly bewildered.</t4601> <t4602>That couldn't just be a joke.</t4602> <t4603>Could it be that I had done something so daring, seized knowledge, just for a joke?</t4603> <t4604>"What kind of joke?"</t4604>
<t4605>“You know how the male students are,” he said.</t4605> <t4606>In the laughter, there was a hint of nostalgia, now I understand, a gentle laugh towards someone who once was himself.</t4606> <t4607>He stood up, crossed the room to the bookshelf, and took a book from the collection; but it was not a dictionary.</t4607> <t4608>It was an old book, seemingly a textbook, with curled edges, stained with ink.</t4608> <t4609>Before handing it to me, he flipped through it, pensive, reminiscing, then “Here,” he said, placing it open on the table in front of me.</t4609>
<t4610>I first saw the picture: Venus de Milo, a black and white photo, with a mustache and a black bra with scribbled armpit hair drawn on.</t4610> <t4611>The next page was the Roman Colosseum, with English annotations, and below, the conjugation of the verb: sum es est, sumus estis sunt.</t4611> <t4612>"Here it is," he pointed to it, and in the margin, I saw it, in the same ink that had added hair to Venus.</t4612> <t4613>Nolite te bastardies carborundorum.</t4613>
<t4614>"It's a bit hard to explain what's funny unless you know Latin," he said.</t4614> <t4615>"Back in the day, we used to write all kinds of things like that.</t4615> <t4616>I don't know where it came from, probably taught by the older kids." Forgetting about me and even himself, he flipped through the pages.</t4616> <t4617>"Look at this," he said.</t4617> <t4618>The picture was titled The Women of the Sabine Tribe, with a note in the margin: pim pis pit, pimus pistis pants.</t4618> <t4619>"There's another one," he said.</t4619> <t4620>"Cim, cis, cit..."</t4620> <t4621>He trailed off, returning to the present, embarrassed.</t4621> <t4622>He laughed again, this time it could be called a smirk.</t4622> <t4623>I imagined him with freckles, with a cowlick.</t4623> <t4624>At this moment, I almost liked him.</t4624>
<t4625>“But what does it mean?” I asked.</t4625>
<t4626>“Which one?” he asked. “Ah.</t4626> <t4627>It means, ‘Don’t let the bastards grind you down.’</t4627> <t4628>We thought we were very clever back then.</t4628><t4629>”</t4629>
<t4630>I forced a smile, but now everything is clear.</t4630> <t4631>I understand why she wrote this sentence on the wardrobe, but I also understand that she must have known it from here, in this room.</t4631> <t4632>Where else? She was never a male student.</t4632> <t4633>Knowing him, in a childhood reminiscence session, a precedent-setting heart-to-heart exchange.</t4633> <t4634>So, I am not the first.</t4634> <t4635>Entering his quiet world, playing with him the childish game of arranging letters.</t4635>
<t4636>“Is it her?” I asked.</t4636>
<t4637>He almost didn't hesitate for a second.</t4637> <t4638>"Do you know her</t4638><t4639>?"</t4639>
<t4640>"I know," I said.</t4640>
<t4641>“She hanged herself,” he said; thoughtfully, not sadly. “That's why we removed the lamp base.</t4641> <t4642>In her room.” He paused.</t4642> <t4643>“Serena found her,” he said, as if that was enough explanation.</t4643> <t4644>And it was.</t4644>
<t4645>This dog dies, get another one.</t4645>
<t4646>“With what?” I asked.</t4646>
<t4647>He didn't want to show me the way.</t4647> <t4648>"What does it matter?" he said.</t4648> <t4649>The bed sheets were torn, I guess.</t4649> <t4650>I had considered all possibilities.</t4650>
<t4651>“I guess Cora found out,” I said. That's why she screamed.</t4651>
<t4652>“Yes,” he said. “Poor thing.” He meant Cora.</t4652>
<t4653>“Maybe I shouldn't come here anymore,” I said.</t4653>
<t4654>“I thought you liked it,” he said lightly, but looked at me with bright, attentive eyes. If I were more naive, I might think he was afraid. “I hope so.</t4654><t4655>”</t4655>
<t4656>"You want my life to still be bearable," I said.</t4656> <t4657>That sentence was uttered not as a question, but as a straightforward assertion, without any beating around the bush.</t4657> <t4658>If my life can bear it, perhaps what they are doing will ultimately be alright.</t4658>
<t4659>"Yes," he said.</t4659> <t4660>"I want that.</t4660> <t4661>That would be better.</t4661><t4662>"</t4662>
<t4663>"Very well," I said.</t4663> <t4664>The wind has changed direction.</t4664> <t4665>Now I have a hold on you.</t4665> <t4666>A hold thanks to my own ability to die.</t4666> <t4667>A hold on your guilty conscience. Finally.</t4667>
<t4668>"What do you want?" he said, still softly like that, as if it were just a financial transaction, and a very petty one at that: candy, medicine.</t4668>
<t4669>“Besides the lotion, right,” I said.</t4669>
<t4670>“Except for the lotion,” he agreed.</t4670>
<t4671>“I want...” I said.</t4671> <t4672>“I want to know.” It sounded uncertain, even stupid, I had spoken without thinking.</t4672>
<t4673>"Know what?" he said.</t4673>
<t4674>"Anything that needs to be known," I said; but that was too blunt.</t4674> <t4675>"What's happening."</t4675>
<t4676>XI - Night</t4676>
<t4677>30</t4677>
<t4678>Night falls.</t4678> <t4679>Or perhaps it just descended.</t4679> <t4680>Why does it fall, and not rise, like dawn?</t4680> <t4681>But if you look to the East at sunset, you will see the night rising, not falling; the dark night ascends, rising from the horizon, like a black sun behind the clouds.</t4681> <t4682>Like smoke from a hidden fire, a line of fire just below the horizon, a burning prairie or perhaps a city.</t4682> <t4683>Maybe night falls because it is heavy, a thick curtain pulled up to cover the eyes.</t4683> <t4684>A woolen blanket.</t4684> <t4685>I wish I could see in the dark, better than I can now.</t4685>
<t4686>Well, the night had just fallen.</t4686> <t4687>I felt it pressing down on me like a boulder.</t4687> <t4688>There was no wind.</t4688> <t4689>I sat by the half-open window, the curtain gathered because outside there was no one, no need for decorum, wearing a nightgown, long sleeves covering everything even in summer, protecting us from the temptation of our own flesh, preventing us from wrapping our bare arms tightly around ourselves.</t4689> <t4690>Nothing moved under the probing moonlight.</t4690> <t4691>The scent of flowers in the garden rose like body heat, there must be night-blooming flowers, the smell was too strong.</t4691> <t4692>I could almost see it, radiating red in all directions, wavering and rising like the air over asphalt on a midday highway.</t4692>
<t4693>Below, on the grass, a figure emerged from the shadow under the willow tree, stepping into the light, the long shadow closely following their heels.</t4693> <t4694>Was it Nick, or someone else, someone who didn't matter?</t4694> <t4695>The person stopped, looked up at this window, I saw a long, pale face.</t4695> <t4696>Nick.</t4696> <t4697>We looked at each other.</t4697> <t4698>I had no roses to throw, he had no guitar.</t4698> <t4699>But the hunger remained the same.</t4699>
<t4700>I cannot tolerate it.</t4700> <t4701>I pulled the left curtain down between us, covering my face, and after a moment he continued walking, disappearing from sight around the corner of the house.</t4701>
<t4702>The commander was right.</t4702> <t4703>One with one with one with one is not four.</t4703> <t4704>Each one is still unique, there is no way to merge them together.</t4704> <t4705>They cannot be swapped, one replacing the other.</t4705> <t4706>They cannot substitute for each other.</t4706> <t4707>Nick with Luke or Luke with Nick.</t4707> <t4708>It should not be used here.</t4708>
<t4709>You don't control your emotions, Moira once said, but you do control your actions.</t4709>
<t4710>It sounds quite good.</t4710>
<t4711>It's all about the context - or is it ripe for the picking?</t4711> <t4712>One of those two.</t4712>
<t4713>The night before leaving home, for the last time, I walked through the rooms.</t4713> <t4714>I didn't pack anything, because we weren't taking much and even then we couldn't risk showing any sign that we were about to leave.</t4714> <t4715>So I just walked, stopping here and there, glancing at things, the orderly scene we had arranged together, to live our whole lives.</t4715> <t4716>I vaguely thought that I might be able to remember, later on, how it used to look.</t4716>
<t4717>Luke is in the living room.</t4717> <t4718>He wraps his arms around me.</t4718> <t4719>We both feel sorrowful and pitiful.</t4719> <t4720>How could we know we were happy, even then?</t4720> <t4721>Because at least we still had that: an embrace.</t4721>
<t4722>The cat, he said so.</t4722>
<t4723>Cat? I said, burying myself into his sweater.</t4723>
<t4724>I can't just leave it here.</t4724>
<t4725>I had not considered the cat.</t4725> <t4726>Neither had he.</t4726> <t4727>The decision came too suddenly, then we had to make a plan.</t4727> <t4728>I probably thought it would come along.</t4728> <t4729>But no, no one takes a cat along for a one-day picnic across the border.</t4729>
<t4730>What about outside?</t4730> <t4731>I said.</t4731> <t4732>We could just leave it there.</t4732>
<t4733>It will linger by the door and meow.</t4733> <t4734>Someone will realize that I have gone missing.</t4734>
<t4735>It could be given to someone's house.</t4735> <t4736>For example, the neighbor's house.</t4736> <t4737>As soon as I said it, I realized how stupid the idea was.</t4737>
<t4738>I'll take care of that, Luke said.</t4738> <t4739>And because he said "that" and not "it," I knew he meant to kill it.</t4739> <t4740>That's what you have to do before killing, I thought.</t4740> <t4741>First, you have to create a situation where there was nothing.</t4741> <t4742>Act first in your mind, then carry it out in reality.</t4742> <t4743>So that's how people do it, I thought.</t4743> <t4744>It seems I never knew that before.</t4744>
<t4745>Luke found the cat, hiding under the bed.</t4745> <t4746>They always know.</t4746> <t4747>He took it to the garage.</t4747> <t4748>I don't know what he did, never asked.</t4748> <t4749>I sat in the living room, hands in my lap.</t4749> <t4750>I should have gone with him, taken that small responsibility.</t4750> <t4751>At the very least, I should have asked him about it later, so he wouldn't have to bear it alone; because that small sacrifice, that erasure of love, was also for me.</t4751>
<t4752>One of the things they do is that.</t4752> <t4753>They make people kill, inside themselves.</t4753>
<t4754>Also meaningless, as I see it.</t4754> <t4755>I don't know who reported it.</t4755> <t4756>It could have been a neighbor, seeing our car leaving the gate in the morning, intuitively prompted, whispering to them to go find a gold star on some list somewhere.</t4756> <t4757>It might even have been the person who got us the passport; why not take advantage twice?</t4757> <t4758>Who knows, maybe they themselves arranged for the passport makers, setting a trap for the naive.</t4758> <t4759>The eye of God roams the entire world.</t4759>
<t4760>Because they had anticipated our arrival, waiting for us.</t4760> <t4761>The moment of betrayal is the worst, the moment when one is absolutely certain that they have been betrayed: that another person has wished so much harm upon them.</t4761>
<t4762>Like in an elevator room with a broken chain anchor above.</t4762> <t4763>Falling, falling endlessly, not knowing when it will hit the ground.</t4763>
<t4764>I tried to call out, to summon the spirits of my own, wherever they might be.</t4764> <t4765>I needed to remember what they looked like.</t4765> <t4766>I tried my best to fix them behind my eyelids, their faces, like photos in an album.</t4766> <t4767>But they wouldn't stay still, they kept stretching out, a smile appearing and then vanishing, the lines curving and folding like burning photo paper, swallowed by shadows.</t4767> <t4768>A flash passed by, a flicker in the air; glowing, radiating, electrons dancing, then back to faces, many faces.</t4768> <t4769>But they faded again, even though I reached out, they slipped away from me, dawn phantoms.</t4769> <t4770>Returning to their usual abode.</t4770> <t4771>Stay, I wanted to say.</t4771> <t4772>But they didn't listen.</t4772>
<t4773>It's my fault.</t4773> <t4774>I'm forgetting too much.</t4774>
<t4775>Tonight I will pray.</t4775>
<t4776>No longer kneeling at the foot of the bed, knees placed on the hard wooden floor of the gymnasium, Aunt Elizabeth stood on the door, arms crossed, a cattle prod hanging at her hip, while Aunt Lydia strode along the rows of women kneeling in nightgowns, lightly whipping our backs, legs, buttocks, or hands, tapping, lightly striking, with a pointer, if we were distracted or sluggish.</t4776> <t4777>Aunt wanted our heads bowed precisely, our toes neatly together, our elbows at the correct angle.</t4777> <t4778>Part of that interest had an aesthetic reason: Aunt liked the appearance of things.</t4778> <t4779>Aunt wanted us to look like Anglo-Saxon relics, carved on tombstones, or angels on Christmas cards, straight and stiff in pure white gowns.</t4779> <t4780>But Aunt also understood the spiritual value of a rigid body, of muscle tension: physical pain would cleanse the mind, she said.</t4780>
<t4781>We pray to be empty, worthy to be filled: grace, love, chastity, semen, and babies.</t4781>
<t4782>Oh Lord, king of the entire universe, thank you for not creating me as a man.</t4782>
<t4783>Oh Lord, please rid me.</t4783> <t4784>Allow me to flourish.</t4784> <t4785>Torment my body, so that I may thrive.</t4785> <t4786>Let me be filled...</t4786>
<t4787>There are many who will be overly excited.</t4787> <t4788>Intoxicated in humiliation.</t4788> <t4789>There are many who will moan and cry.</t4789>
<t4790>Making a fool of yourself won't do any good, Janine, Aunt Lydia said.</t4790>
<t4791>I sit still and pray, by the window, looking through the curtain at the deserted garden.</t4791> <t4792>I don't even bother to close my eyes.</t4792> <t4793>Out there or in my head, it's equally dark.</t4793> <t4794>Or equally bright.</t4794>
<t4795>My Lord.</t4795> <t4796>Currently reigning in the Kingdom of Heaven, which means residing within me.</t4796>
<t4797>I wish you would tell me your Name, I mean your real name.</t4797> <t4798>But it's okay if you don't, it's not a big deal.</t4798>
<t4799>I wish I knew what He foresaw.</t4799> <t4800>But whatever it is, please help me get through it, I beg you.</t4800> <t4801>Even though it may not be His doing; not for a moment do I believe that what is happening out there is His will.</t4801>
<t4802>I have enough bread for daily consumption, so I won't waste time on that.</t4802> <t4803>That's not the main issue; the issue is how to swallow it without choking.</t4803>
<t4804>Now comes the lesson of forgiveness. No need to worry about forgiving me at this moment.</t4804> <t4805>There are more important matters.</t4805> <t4806>For example: keeping the remaining people safe, if they are currently safe.</t4806> <t4807>Don't let them suffer too much.</t4807> <t4808>If they must die, make it quick.</t4808> <t4809>Someone who can grant them a Heaven is fine, we must rely on Him for that.</t4809> <t4810>As for Hell, we are capable of creating it for ourselves.</t4810>
<t4811>I guess I should say I forgive everyone who caused that, as well as everything they are doing.</t4811> <t4812>I will try, but it's really not easy.</t4812>
<t4813>Next is the lesson on temptation. At the Center, temptation is anything beyond eating and sleeping. Knowing is already a temptation.</t4813> <t4814>What you don't know won't tempt you, Aunt Lydia often said.</t4814>
<t4815>Maybe I don't really want to know what's happening.</t4815> <t4816>Maybe I'd rather not know.</t4816> <t4817>Maybe I don't have the strength to know.</t4817> <t4818>The Fall of Man, is a fall from ignorance to knowledge.</t4818>
<t4819>I think too much about the chandelier, even though it's gone.</t4819> <t4820>But I can still use the hook, in the wardrobe.</t4820> <t4821>I've considered every possibility.</t4821> <t4822>All that needs to be done, after tying myself up, is to lean forward and not struggle.</t4822>
<t4823>Save us from evil.</t4823>
<t4824>Then there will be the Kingdom of Heaven, power, and glory.</t4824> <t4825>It takes a lot of effort to believe in those things right now.</t4825> <t4826>But I will try.</t4826> <t4827>Hope, like on the tombstones.</t4827>
<t4828>You must feel exploited.</t4828> <t4829>I bet it's not the first time.</t4829>
<t4830>If I were you, I would be sick of it.</t4830> <t4831>I would be fed up.</t4831> <t4832>I think that's where we differ.</t4832>
<t4833>I feel so vague, talking to You like this.</t4833> <t4834>I feel like I'm talking to a wall.</t4834> <t4835>I wish You would respond.</t4835> <t4836>I feel so lonely.</t4836>
<t4837>Alone by the phone.</t4837> <t4838>But now I can't use the phone.</t4838> <t4839>And even if I could, who would I call?</t4839>
<t4840>Oh God.</t4840> <t4841>I'm not calling in jest.</t4841> <t4842>Oh God, oh God.</t4842> <t4843>How do I continue living?</t4843>
<t4844>XII - Jezebel's Palace</t4844>
<t4845>31</t4845>
<t4846>Every night when I lie down in bed, I think, Tomorrow morning I will wake up in my own home and everything will be back to the way it was before.</t4846>
<t4847>This morning neither.</t4847>
<t4848>I put on my clothes, summer clothes - it's still summer, time seems to have stopped in summer.</t4848> <t4849>July, the stifling days and sweltering nights, it's hard to sleep.</t4849> <t4850>I pay attention to counting time.</t4850> <t4851>I mark on the wall, one mark per day, adding a cross line when seven days are complete.</t4851> <t4852>But for what purpose, this is not a prison sentence; there is no deadline to pass and settle.</t4852> <t4853>Anyway, I just need to open my mouth and ask to know what day it is today.</t4853> <t4854>Yesterday was the fourth of July, once Independence Day, before it was abolished.</t4854> <t4855>Somewhere in May will be Mother's Day, that still remains.</t4855> <t4856>Though before, it wasn't just confined to childbirth.</t4856>
<t4857>But I count the days according to the moon.</t4857> <t4858>Lunar calendar, not solar calendar.</t4858>
<t4859>I bent down to put on the red shoes; now lighter, with cautious grooves, though not as daring as sandals.</t4859> <t4860>Bending over is a real effort: even though I still exercise, I can feel my body gradually going on strike, resisting.</t4860> <t4861>That's exactly how I imagine women when they get old, very old.</t4861> <t4862>I also feel that I walk the same way: my back hunched, my spine curved into a question mark, my bones losing calcium, becoming porous like limestone.</t4862> <t4863>When I was young, imagining old age, I thought, Maybe you'll learn to appreciate more when you don't have much time left.</t4863> <t4864>I forgot to account for the decline in strength.</t4864> <t4865>There are days when I do appreciate more, eggs, and flowers, but then I laugh at myself for just being sentimental, my mind coated in a dull four-color hue, like those "beautiful sunset" postcards that used to be everywhere in California.</t4865> <t4866>Glossy hearts.</t4866>
<t4867>Gray threat looming.</t4867>
<t4868>If only Luke were here, in the room while I was dressing, so I could argue with him.</t4868> <t4869>It sounds strange, but that's what I want.</t4869> <t4870>To bicker about who loads the dishes into the dishwasher, whose turn it is to sort the laundry, to scrub the toilet; trivial daily details amidst the grand movements of the universe.</t4870> <t4871>We even used to argue about those things, whether they were trivial or significant.</t4871> <t4872>Now it feels like such a luxury.</t4872> <t4873>Though it wasn't that frequent.</t4873> <t4874>These days, I sketch out each chapter of our arguments in my head, including the subsequent reconciliation scene.</t4874>
<t4875>I sit in the chair, the garland on the ceiling floating high above, a frozen halo, a zero.</t4875> <t4876>A hole in the universe where a star just exploded. Ripples on the water's surface, the stone just thrown in.</t4876> <t4877>All things round and white.</t4877> <t4878>I wait for the day to unfold, wait for the earth to turn, following the round face of the clock, with a jellyfish heart.</t4878> <t4879>Geometric days, circling around and around, smooth as if greased.</t4879> <t4880>Sweat beads on my lips, I wait, wait for the arrival of the inevitable egg, which will be lukewarm like the room and have a green film on the yolk with a hint of sulfur.</t4880>
<t4881>Still today, later, with Ofglen, the usual shopping hour:</t4881>
<t4882>We went to the church, as usual, to look at some graves.</t4882> <t4883>Then to the Wall.</t4883> <t4884>Today there were only two people: a Catholic believer, though not a priest, wearing a large inverted cross around his neck, and the other from a denomination I couldn't recognize.</t4884> <t4885>The body was only marked with the letter J, in red.</t4885> <t4886>Not Jewish, that would be a yellow star.</t4886> <t4887>But anyway, there aren't many Jews left.</t4887> <t4888>They have been declared the Descendants of Jacob, they are special, they have the right to choose.</t4888> <t4889>They can convert or emigrate to Israel.</t4889> <t4890>Most have emigrated, if the news can be believed.</t4890> <t4891>I saw a ship full of people, on TV, leaning over the side of the ship, dressed in black, black hats and long beards, trying to look as Jewish as possible, in outfits dug out from ancient times, women with their heads wrapped in scarves, smiling and waving, though a bit stiffly, as if showing off; another scene, the wealthier ones, lining up to board a plane.</t4891> <t4892>Ofglen said some managed to escape that way, pretending to be Jewish, but it wasn't easy because there were many rounds of scrutiny and now the process has tightened up.</t4892>
<t4893>However, people are not hanged just for being Jewish.</t4893> <t4894>People are hanged for being talkative Jews who refuse to make choices.</t4894> <t4895>Or pretend to convert.</t4895> <t4896>The TV shows everything: midnight raids, Jewish items stored under the bed being dug out, scriptures, prayer shawls, Star of David.</t4896> <t4897>Along with the owners, faces swollen, stubborn, being pushed against the bedroom wall by the Eyes, while a sorrowful voiceover recounts their betrayal and ingratitude to us.</t4897>
<t4898>So J is not a descendant of Jacob.</t4898> <t4899>Then what is he?</t4899> <t4900>A Jehovah's Witness? A Jesuit?</t4900> <t4901>Whatever he is, he can't die any more than he already has.</t4901>
<t4902>After this ritual of gazing, we continued on, as usual, looking for a spacious place to talk to each other.</t4902> <t4903>If it could even be called talking, those snippets of whispered fragments, uttered through the funnel of white wings.</t4903> <t4904>More accurately, it was like a piece of telegram, semaphore by mouth.</t4904> <t4905>Crippled words.</t4905>
<t4906>We cannot stand in one place for too long.</t4906> <t4907>We don't want to be caught for loitering.</t4907>
<t4908>Today we took the path opposite Quyển hồn, to a place that seemed like a public garden, in the middle of a very large, old building; late Victorian, meticulously decorated, stained glass.</t4908> <t4909>In the past, this was called the Memorial House, though I never knew what it commemorated.</t4909> <t4910>Some people were stuck there.</t4910>
<t4911>Moira said that in the past, university students often ate here, back when the school first opened.</t4911> <t4912>If a woman walked in, she would get bread thrown at her, she said.</t4912>
<t4913>For what? I said.</t4913> <t4914>Moira, over the years, has become increasingly adept at these kinds of anecdotes.</t4914> <t4915>I don't really like that kind of past resentment.</t4915>
<t4916>To drive her away, she replied.</t4916>
<t4917>It might be like throwing peanuts to an elephant, I said.</t4917>
<t4918>Moira laughed; she could always laugh.</t4918> <t4919>Monsters from afar, she said.</t4919>
<t4920>We stood looking at the building for a while, noting its shape was almost like a church, a grand cathedral.</t4920> <t4921>Ofglen said, "I heard the Eyes have parties here."</t4921>
<t4922>"Who said that?" I asked.</t4922> <t4923>There was no one around, so we spoke more freely, but out of habit, we still lowered our voices.</t4923>
<t4924>“The network,” she said.</t4924> <t4925>She paused, glanced sideways, I felt the white streak quiver as the wings fluttered. “There is a password,” she said.</t4925>
<t4926>"Password?" I asked.</t4926> <t4927>"For what?"</t4927>
<t4928>"To find out," she said.</t4928> <t4929>"Who's in, who's out."</t4929>
<t4930>Even though I didn't see clearly if it would be beneficial for me, I still asked, "So what is it?"</t4930>
<t4931>“Mayday,” she said.</t4931> <t4932>“I already tried with you once.” “Mayday,” I repeated.</t4932> <t4933>I still remember that day.</t4933> <t4934>M’aidez.</t4934>
<t4935>"Don't use it unless absolutely necessary," Ofglen said.</t4935> <t4936>"We shouldn't know each other too well, among the roots.</t4936> <t4937>In case we get caught."</t4937>
<t4938>I find it hard to believe those whispers, those revelations, even though at the time I believed them.</t4938> <t4939>But upon returning, they seem unreal, childish even, like a joke for fun; like a group of schoolgirls, with little secrets from high school days.</t4939> <t4940>Or like the spy novels I used to read, every weekend, when I should have been finishing my homework, or late-night TV dramas.</t4940> <t4941>Passwords, forbidden topics, double lives, secret communications: none of it seems worthy of being the true nature of the real world.</t4941> <t4942>But this is just my own illusion, remnants from a reality that had once been ingrained in me.</t4942>
<t4943>And then there are the roots.</t4943> <t4944>Root stringing, another one of mother's favorite terms, a moldy expression from years past.</t4944> <t4945>Even at sixty, mother still did what she called root stringing, though to me it seemed like the whole activity was just having lunch with another old lady.</t4945>
<t4946>Ofglen and I parted ways at the corner.</t4946> <t4947>"See you later," she said.</t4947> <t4948>She glided away on the sidewalk, and I took the path back home.</t4948> <t4949>There was Nick, his hat askew; today he didn't even bother to look at me.</t4949> <t4950>But he must have lingered, waiting for me, to deliver that silent message, because as soon as he was sure I had seen him, he gave the car one last wipe and then strode towards the garage door.</t4950>
<t4951>I walk on the gravel path, between two excessively green patches of grass.</t4951> <t4952>Serena Joy is sitting by the willow tree, on a chair, with her cane resting on her elbow.</t4952> <t4953>She is wearing a cool cotton dress.</t4953> <t4954>Hers is blue, the color of the sea, not the red of my dress, drenched with heat yet simultaneously burning.</t4954> <t4955>I can only see half of her face; she is knitting.</t4955> <t4956>How can she touch the wool in this heat?</t4956> <t4957>But perhaps her skin has become numb; perhaps it feels nothing, like a healed scald from boiling water.</t4957>
<t4958>I kept my eyes down on the gravel road, gliding past her, hoping to be invisible, knowing I would be ignored.</t4958> <t4959>But this time was different.</t4959>
<t4960>"Offred," she said.</t4960>
<t4961>I stopped, hesitating.</t4961>
<t4962>“It’s you.”</t4962>
<t4963>I lift my eyes covered by a patch.</t4963>
<t4964>"Come this way."</t4964> <t4965>"I need you."</t4965><t4966>"</t4966>
<t4967>I stepped across the grass to stand in front of her, eyes downcast.</t4967>
<t4968>“You can sit,” she said. “Here, take the pillow.</t4968> <t4969>I need you to hold the yarn.”</t4969> <t4970>She was holding a cigarette, flicking ash onto the grass, next to a cup of something, not sure if it was coffee or tea.</t4970> <t4971>“It's suffocating in there.</t4971> <t4972>You need some fresh air,” she said.</t4972> <t4973>I sat down, basket placed on the grass, with strawberries and chicken, noting the curse: a new addition.</t4973> <t4974>She looped the yarn around my outstretched hands, starting to wind it.</t4974> <t4975>I felt tied up, seemingly chained; caught in a spider web, more accurately.</t4975> <t4976>The gray yarn was damp from the humidity, like a child's wet blanket, faintly smelling of wet sheep.</t4976> <t4977>At least my hands were coated with lanolin.</t4977>
<t4978>Serena rolled the yarn, a cigarette at the corner of her mouth smoldering, exhaling waves of temptation.</t4978> <t4979>She rolled very slowly and with difficulty because her hands were starting to become impaired, but she was full of determination.</t4979> <t4980>Perhaps knitting, for her, also required mustering up willpower, who knows, it might even be painful.</t4980> <t4981>Who knows if the doctor prescribed it: ten rows of knitting up, ten rows of knitting down each day.</t4981> <t4982>Though surely not just ten.</t4982> <t4983>The evergreen trees and the boys and girls, squares and triangles before me took on a different meaning: evidence of her stubbornness, and not entirely detestable.</t4983>
<t4984>My mother never did anything like weaving or knitting.</t4984> <t4985>But whenever she brought back the laundry, expensive shirts, winter coats, she would keep the safety pins and string them together.</t4985> <t4986>Then she would pin that chain somewhere - on the bed, on the pillow, the back of a chair, oven mitts - to avoid losing them.</t4986> <t4987>Then she would completely forget about them.</t4987> <t4988>I would find them, somewhere in the house, in the houses; traces of my mother, remnants of an unfulfilled intention, like signposts on a road that leads nowhere.</t4988> <t4989>Those moments felt like returning to family life.</t4989>
<t4990>"Is that so," Serena said.</t4990> <t4991>She stopped rolling, leaving me with the fur wreath still in my hands, and picked the cigarette stub from her mouth to stub it out. "Still nothing?"</t4991>
<t4992>I know what she is talking about.</t4992> <t4993>There aren't many topics to discuss between us; we have nothing in common, except for that mysterious and capricious matter.</t4993>
<t4994>“Not yet,” I said.</t4994> <t4995>“Nothing yet.”</t4995>
<t4996>“How awful,” she said.</t4996> <t4997>It's hard to imagine her with a baby.</t4997> <t4998>But mostly it will be the Martha sisters taking care of it.</t4998> <t4999>Even so, she still wants me to get pregnant, finish it off, and leave, ending the shameful sweaty entanglement, ending the triangle of flesh under the canopy adorned with silver flower stars.</t4999> <t5000>Peace and tranquility.</t5000> <t5001>I can't think of any other reason that could make her wish for such a great fortune, for me.</t5001>
<t5002>“Your time is almost up,” she said.</t5002> <t5003>It was not a question, it was a fact.</t5003>
<t5004>"Yes," I said emotionlessly.</t5004>
<t5005>She is lighting another cigarette, fumbling with the lighter.</t5005> <t5006>Obviously, her hands are getting worse.</t5006> <t5007>But don't make the mistake of offering help, she will get angry.</t5007> <t5008>Don't make the mistake of pointing out her weakness.</t5008>
<t5009>“Perhaps you won't say,” she said.</t5009>
<t5010>I don't know who you are talking about.</t5010> <t5011>Are you talking about the Commander, or are you talking about God? If it's God, you already said you don't want to.</t5011> <t5012>Either way, it's heresy.</t5012> <t5013>Only women are unyielding, stubbornly closed off, broken, and defective.</t5013>
<t5014>“Yes,” I said.</t5014> <t5015>“Perhaps you won't be famous.”</t5015>
<t5016>I looked up at her.</t5016> <t5017>She looked down.</t5017> <t5018>For the first time, we looked directly into each other's eyes after all that time.</t5018> <t5019>Since we first met.</t5019> <t5020>That moment stretched out between the two of us, calm and bleak.</t5020> <t5021>She was trying to see if I was catching on to the situation or not.</t5021>
<t5022>“Maybe,” she said, holding a cigarette, still unlit.</t5022> <t5023>“Maybe you should find another way.</t5023><t5024>”</t5024>
<t5025>Is she talking about a four-legged cow?</t5025> <t5026>"Find a way?" I said.</t5026> <t5027>I had to try to appear serious.</t5027>
<t5028>“Find someone else,” she said.</t5028>
<t5029>“You know I am not allowed,” I said, carefully hiding my anger. “It is against the law.</t5029> <t5030>You know the punishment.”</t5030>
<t5031>“I know,” she said.</t5031> <t5032>She had prepared, had thought it through.</t5032> <t5033>“I know in theory it shouldn't be done.</t5033> <t5034>But it happened.</t5034> <t5035>Women often do that. Always do that.”</t5035>
<t5036>“With the doctor, perhaps?” I said, recalling the kind, sympathetic brown eyes and the ungloved hand.</t5036> <t5037>The last time I met a different doctor.</t5037> <t5038>Maybe someone had caught him, or a woman had reported it.</t5038> <t5039>Though they wouldn't believe her without evidence.</t5039>
<t5040>“Some do,” she said, her voice now almost friendly, though distant; as if they were discussing nail polish colors.</t5040> <t5041>“Ofwarren, for example.</t5041> <t5042>The lady of that house knows, surely.” She paused to let it sink in.</t5042> <t5043>“I will help you.</t5043> <t5044>I will make sure nothing goes wrong.”</t5044>
<t5045>I thought for a moment. "No doctor," I said.</t5045>
<t5046>“Of course,” she agreed, and at least for this moment we were bosom friends, was this the kitchen table, was the topic being discussed the date, the girls' campaign to arrange flirtations.</t5046> <t5047>“Sometimes they blackmail.</t5047> <t5048>But it doesn't necessarily have to be a doctor.</t5048> <t5049>It could be someone trustworthy.</t5049><t5050>”</t5050>
<t5051>“Who?” I said.</t5051>
<t5052>“I am thinking it could be Nick,” she said, her voice almost caressing.</t5052> <t5053>“He has been here for quite a while.</t5053> <t5054>He is loyal.</t5054> <t5055>I can make a deal.”</t5055>
<t5056>So, he is the one who runs those small black market deals for her.</t5056> <t5057>Does he always get this in return?</t5057>
<t5058>“What about the Commander?” I asked.</t5058>
<t5059>"Well," she said, with a determined look; no, more than that, a gaze tightening like a purse snapping shut.</t5059> <t5060>"We won't tell him, will we?"</t5060>
<t5061>The proposal hung between us, almost visible, tangible: heavy, dark, shapeless; a conspiracy, perhaps, a betrayal, perhaps.</t5061> <t5062>She truly needed the child.</t5062>
<t5063>“It's very dangerous,” I said.</t5063> <t5064>“Even more so.” It was my life I was betting with, but either way, sooner or later, this way or that, whether I nodded or shook my head.</t5064> <t5065>Both she and I knew this.</t5065>
<t5066>“Better to do it than not,” she said.</t5066> <t5067>That was what I thought as well.</t5067>
<t5068>“Alright,” I said. “Yes.”</t5068>
<t5069>She leaned forward.</t5069> <t5070>"Maybe I can get you something," she said.</t5070> <t5071>Because I have been good. "Something you want," she added, almost coaxingly.</t5071>
<t5072>"What is it?" I said.</t5072> <t5073>I couldn't think of anything I truly wanted that she would be willing or able to give me.</t5073>
<t5074>“A photo,” she said, as if offering a reward to a child, ice cream, a trip to the zoo.</t5074> <t5075>I looked up again, bewildered.</t5075>
<t5076>"Her photo," she said.</t5076> <t5077>"Your daughter.</t5077> <t5078>But maybe not."</t5078>
<t5079>So you know where they took the child, where the child is living.</t5079><t5080>During that entire time, my throat was choked up.</t5080><t5081>That wretched woman, she didn't bother to tell me, didn't bother to inform me, any news would have sufficed.</t5081><t5082>Didn't bother to reveal anything anymore.</t5082><t5083>Like a wooden or stone person, she has no capacity to understand.</t5083><t5084>But I must not let it slip, must not lose it, even something this small.</t5084><t5085>Cannot lose this hope.</t5085><t5086>I must not speak.</t5086>
<t5087>She was truly laughing, almost caressing; there was a vague shadow of the charm of an old TV doll, passing over her face like a momentary interference signal.</t5087> <t5088>“Knitting wool in this weather is hot as hell, isn't it?” she said.</t5088> <t5089>She took the bundle of wool from my hand, which I had been holding out all this time.</t5089> <t5090>Then she looked at the cigarette she was still toying with, and somewhat awkwardly, pressed it into my hand, folding my fingers around it.</t5090> <t5091>“Find some matches yourself,” she said.</t5091> <t5092>“There are some in the kitchen, just ask Rita for a stick.</t5092> <t5093>Tell her I gave it to you.</t5093> <t5094>But only one stick,” she added mischievously.</t5094> <t5095>“We don't want to harm your health!”</t5095>
<t5096>32</t5096>
<t5097>Rita is sitting by the table.</t5097> <t5098>A large glass bowl with ice cubes is on the table next to her.</t5098> <t5099>Carved radishes, shaped like roses or tulips, float inside it.</t5099> <t5100>She is cutting more on the cutting board, using a carving knife, her large hands moving swiftly and indifferently.</t5100> <t5101>Her whole body is still, and so is her face.</t5101> <t5102>It's as if she is performing this trick while half-asleep.</t5102> <t5103>On the white enamel table is a pile of radishes, washed but not yet sliced.</t5103> <t5104>Tiny Aztec hearts.</t5104>
<t5105>She didn't bother to look up at me.</t5105> <t5106>"You got everything, huh," she said just that, as she checked each package I took out.</t5106>
<t5107>"Can I have a match?" I asked her.</t5107> <t5108>It was strange to see how she made me feel small and demanding, just by frowning, just by being indifferent; I felt myself pleading and whining.</t5108>
<t5109>“Matches?” she said.</t5109> <t5110>“What do you need matches for?”</t5110>
<t5111>"She told me to give her a stick," I said, not wanting to admit about the cigar.</t5111>
<t5112>“Who said that?” She continued cutting the radish, her rhythm unchanged.</t5112> <t5113>“You don't need matches for anything.</t5113> <t5114>Going to burn the house down or what.”</t5114>
<t5115>"You can go ask her if needed," I said.</t5115> <t5116>"She is still out on the lawn."</t5116>
<t5117>Rita rolled her eyes at the ceiling, as if silently praying to some deity up there.</t5117> <t5118>Then she sighed, heavily stood up, and noisily wiped her hands on her apron, showing how much I was bothering her.</t5118> <t5119>She went to the cupboard above the sink, moving sluggishly, rummaged for the bunch of keys in her pocket, and opened the cupboard door.</t5119> <t5120>“Put it in here, during the summer,” she seemed to be talking to herself.</t5120> <t5121>“No need to light a fire in this heat.” I still remember back in April when Cora was busy lighting the fireplace, both in the living room and the kitchen, when it was colder.</t5121>
<t5122>Wooden matches, in a sliding lid cardboard box, the kind I used to longingly want to steal to make a wardrobe for my dolls.</t5122> <t5123>She opened the lid, peered inside, as if considering which stick was worthy of giving to me.</t5123> <t5124>“Her own business,” she muttered. “Don't even think about telling her anything.” She plunged her large hand in, picked one out, and handed it to me.</t5124> <t5125>“Now don't go around burning anything,” she said.</t5125> <t5126>“Especially the curtains in the room.</t5126> <t5127>The room is hot enough already.”</t5127>
<t5128>"No," I said.</t5128> <t5129>"I will do something else.</t5129><t5130>"</t5130>
<t5131>She did not bother to ask what the matter was. "Even if you chew it, it doesn't matter," she said.</t5131> <t5132>"She told me to give you one, so I gave you one, that's all."</t5132>
<t5133>She turned away and sat back at the table.</t5133> <t5134>Then she picked up a stone and popped it into her mouth.</t5134> <t5135>A rather strange gesture from her.</t5135> <t5136>I had never seen her so silent while working.</t5136> <t5137>“You can have one too,” she said. “Damn it, having to wear those pillowcases on our heads, in this weather.”</t5137>
<t5138>I was astonished: she never had the habit of inviting me to anything, perhaps she thought that if I had been promoted enough to be given a matchstick, she could also make a nice gesture.</t5138>
<t5139>Is it true that, all of a sudden, I have joined the ranks of those who need flattery?</t5139>
<t5140>“Thank you,” I said.</t5140> <t5141>I carefully moved the matchstick into the sleeve with a zipper next to the cigar, to keep it from getting wet, and took one.</t5141> <t5142>“Nice radish,” I said, in response to her gift, which she had given of her own accord.</t5142>
<t5143>“I like things to be clear-cut, that's it,” she said, frowning as usual.</t5143> <t5144>“Anything else wouldn't make sense.”</t5144>
<t5145>I went out to the hall, up the stairs, my feet hurrying.</t5145> <t5146>In the convex standing mirror I passed by, I saw the red shadow at the edge of the school, a ghost made of red smoke.</t5146> <t5147>My head also became dizzy from the smoke, I could already taste it in my mouth, it sank into my lungs, making my whole body immersed in the coarse, intense breath of cinnamon, followed by the shock when the nicotine hit my bloodstream.</t5147>
<t5148>After all those years, I could throw up.</t5148> <t5149>It's not surprising.</t5149> <t5150>But even so, I still welcome it eagerly.</t5150>
<t5151>I walked down the hallway, where am I now? In the bathroom, turning on the water to wash away the smell, in the bedroom, exhaling towards the window?</t5151> <t5152>Who will catch me doing this? Who knows?</t5152>
<t5153>Right in the midst of savoring such pleasures as before, tasting the imaginations in my mouth, I thought of something else.</t5153>
<t5154>I don't necessarily have to smoke this cigarette.</t5154>
<t5155>I can tear it into small pieces and flush it down the toilet.</t5155> <t5156>Or I can eat it for pleasure, bit by bit, saving the rest for later.</t5156>
<t5157>That way, the matchstick will be preserved.</t5157> <t5158>You can poke a small hole in the mattress, carefully tuck it in.</t5158> <t5159>So small that no one will notice.</t5159> <t5160>It will be there, every night, right under me when I lie down.</t5160> <t5161>Sleeping above it.</t5161>
<t5162>I can go burn down the house.</t5162> <t5163>What a wonderful idea, it makes me tremble.</t5163>
<t5164>An escape, swift, by a hair's breadth.</t5164>
<t5165>I lay on the bed, pretending to nap.</t5165>
<t5166>Commander, last night, our fingers touched, and you watched me rub that greasy lotion all over my hands.</t5166> <t5167>It was quite amusing, I thought about asking for a cigarette, but then I dismissed the idea.</t5167> <t5168>I'm smart enough not to demand too much at once.</t5168> <t5169>I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage.</t5169> <t5170>Moreover, I also don't want to interrupt you.</t5170>
<t5171>Last night he drank whiskey, Scotch with water.</t5171> <t5172>Now he is used to drinking in front of me, to relax at the end of the day, he says.</t5172> <t5173>I need to infer that he is under a lot of pressure.</t5173> <t5174>But he never offers, and I don't ask: we both know what this body is tasked with.</t5174> <t5175>When I kiss him goodbye, as if I wanted to, his breath full of alcohol, I inhale it like smoke.</t5175> <t5176>I must admit I devour it, this stolen pleasure.</t5176>
<t5177>Sometimes after a few drinks he becomes silly, and cheats when playing Scrabble.</t5177> <t5178>He even encourages me to do the same, and we both take extra tiles to make up non-existent words like smurt and crup, laughing hysterically.</t5178> <t5179>Sometimes he turns on the shortwave radio, showing me a minute or two of Radio Free America, just to prove he can do it.</t5179> <t5180>Then he turns it off again.</t5180> <t5181>Those damn Cubans, he says.</t5181> <t5182>Talking nonsense about universal daycare.</t5182>
<t5183>Sometimes, after playing, he would sit on the floor next to my chair, holding my hand.</t5183> <t5184>His head was slightly lower than mine, so he could look up at me from an angle like a child looking up.</t5184> <t5185>Surely, he found joy in that act of feigned submission.</t5185>
<t5186>He is way up high, Ofglen said.</t5186> <t5187>He is at the top, the very top.</t5187> <t5188>It's hard to imagine that these days.</t5188>
<t5189>Occasionally, I try to put myself in his position.</t5189> <t5190>It is a proactive tactic, to anticipate how he might be influenced to behave towards me.</t5190> <t5191>It is hard to believe that I have any power over him, in any way, but it is true; though it is a very ambiguous kind of power.</t5191> <t5192>Sometimes I think I can see myself, though quite vaguely, through the eyes he might see me with.</t5192> <t5193>There are things he wants to prove, gifts he wants to bestow, services he wants to offer, affections he wants to awaken.</t5193>
<t5194>He wants it, that's it.</t5194> <t5195>Especially after a few drinks.</t5195>
<t5196>Sometimes he became grumpy, other times he preferred to philosophize; wanting to explain the situation, justify himself, when things got too complicated, for example.</t5196>
<t5197>It's not just women who face issues on those days, he said, the bigger problem is with men.</t5197> <t5198>They have nothing left.</t5198>
<t5199>Nothing left? I asked.</t5199> <t5200>But they already had...</t5200>
<t5201>They have nothing to do, he said.</t5201>
<t5202>They can go earn money, I said, somewhat insolently.</t5202> <t5203>At this moment, I did not feel afraid of him.</t5203> <t5204>It's hard to be afraid of a man who is sitting and watching himself apply lotion.</t5204> <t5205>This state of fearlessness is truly dangerous.</t5205>
<t5206>That's not enough, he said.</t5206> <t5207>That's too abstract.</t5207> <t5208>I mean they have nothing to do with women anymore.</t5208>
<t5209>"What do you mean by that?" I said.</t5209> <t5210>"What about the whole Pig Alley, it's everywhere, even mechanized."</t5210>
<t5211>I'm not talking about sex, he said.</t5211> <t5212>That's part of it too, sex is too easy to get.</t5212> <t5213>Anyone can go out and buy it.</t5213> <t5214>There's nothing to strive for, nothing to struggle for anymore.</t5214> <t5215>We still have data from that time.</t5215> <t5216>Do you know what they complained about the most?</t5216> <t5217>No more feelings.</t5217> <t5218>Men started turning their backs on sex, that's how far it went.</t5218> <t5219>They turned their backs on marriage.</t5219>
<t5220>So now they have feelings?</t5220> <t5221>I said.</t5221>
<t5222>Yes, he said, looking at me.</t5222> <t5223>Of course. He stood up, walked around the table to my chair.</t5223> <t5224>He placed his hands on my shoulders, from behind.</t5224> <t5225>I couldn't see him.</t5225>
<t5226>I hope to know what you think, his voice rose, behind me.</t5226>
<t5227>I didn't think much, I spoke lightly.</t5227> <t5228>He wants affection, but I can't give it.</t5228>
<t5229>Even if I think about it, does it mean anything, right?</t5229> <t5230>I said.</t5230> <t5231>What I think doesn't matter.</t5231>
<t5232>It is also the only reason he could confide in me.</t5232>
<t5233>Come on, come on, he said, pressing down slightly with his hand.</t5233> <t5234>I am very interested in your opinion.</t5234> <t5235>You are smart, you must have an opinion.</t5235> <t5236>About what? I asked.</t5236>
<t5237>The things we have done, he said.</t5237> <t5238>About the current situation.</t5238>
<t5239>I kept myself very still.</t5239> <t5240>I cleared my mind.</t5240> <t5241>I thought of the sky, a moonless night.</t5241> <t5242>I have no opinion, I said.</t5242>
<t5243>He sighed, his hand relaxed, but still rested on my shoulder.</t5243> <t5244>He knew what I was thinking, alright.</t5244>
<t5245>If you don't break eggs, what will you use to fry? That's all he said.</t5245> <t5246>We thought we could make it better.</t5246>
<t5247>Better? I said, very softly.</t5247> <t5248>How can he think this is better?</t5248>
<t5249>Better never means better for everyone, he said.</t5249> <t5250>It always means worse, for some.</t5250>
<t5251>I lie on my back, the humid air covering me like a lid.</t5251> <t5252>Like the earth.</t5252> <t5253>I hope it will rain.</t5253> <t5254>Even better if a storm comes, dark clouds, lightning strikes, ear-splitting noises.</t5254> <t5255>Who knows, the power might go out.</t5255> <t5256>I will go down to the kitchen, say I'm scared, sit beside Rita and Cora around the table, they will forgive me because it's a common fear, they will welcome me in.</t5256> <t5257>There will be candles, we will see each other's faces flickering thanks to the dim light, thanks to the blinding white flashes outside the door.</t5257> <t5258>Oh Lord, Cora will say.</t5258> <t5259>Oh Lord, save us.</t5259>
<t5260>The air will be clearer and more open afterwards.</t5260>
<t5261>I look up at the ceiling, a circle of plaster flowers.</t5261> <t5262>Draw a circle, step inside, it will protect you.</t5262> <t5263>Descending from the center is a lamp, descending from the lamp is a twisted bedsheet.</t5263> <t5264>She swayed there, gently, like a pendulum; like everyone used to sway as a child, hands gripping a tree branch.</t5264> <t5265>So she was safe, wrapped in the protective circle, when Cora stepped in.</t5265> <t5266>Sometimes I think she is still here, around me.</t5266>
<t5267>I feel like I'm in a grave.</t5267>
<t5268>33</t5268>
<t5269>Late afternoon, the sky is misty, the sunlight is scattered but dense, like gold dust.</t5269> <t5270>I walk with Ofglen on the sidewalk; a pair side by side, another pair ahead, yet another pair across the street.</t5270> <t5271>From a distance, it must look very nice, very beautiful, like Dutch milkmaids embossed on a wall, like a shelf filled with antique ceramic salt and pepper shakers, like a flock of swans, like multiple replicas of something with a touch of grace, however slight.</t5271> <t5272>A pleasing sight, before all eyes, before all Eyes, for that is the true audience of this performance.</t5272> <t5273>We are on our way to the Prayvaganza, to display our obedience and piety.</t5273>
<t5274>Looking around, I couldn't see a single dandelion; every lawn was meticulously trimmed.</t5274> <t5275>I longed to see just one, just one, growing wildly and stubbornly like a weed, perennial and golden like the sun.</t5275> <t5276>Cheerful and simple, radiant without needing anyone's gaze.</t5276> <t5277>With Nhan by my side, we often picked them to weave into garlands, bracelets, and crowns, the sap sticking to our fingers.</t5277> <t5278>Or I would hold one up to my child's chin: "As pretty as a fairy, isn't it?"</t5278> <t5279>Sniffing it, your nose would be dusted with pollen.</t5279> <t5280>Or is it golden hair? Or has it shed its petals and gone to seed: I see you, running across the lawn, the lawn right in front of me, when you were two or three years old, holding the flower like a sparkler, a magic wand flickering with white sparks, the air filled with tiny parachutes.</t5280> <t5281>Blow on it, and you'll know the time.</t5281> <t5282>Thousands of minutes, carried away by the gentle summer breeze.</t5282> <t5283>But it’s the white daisies that can tell love fortunes, we played that game too.</t5283>
<t5284>We lined up at the checkpoint, in pairs, one pair after another, like an entire private girls' school returning from an outing too late.</t5284> <t5285>Late, unbearably late, to the point where everything had grown too big, our feet, our bodies, our clothes grew along with us.</t5285> <t5286>As if enchanted.</t5286> <t5287>This is a fairy tale, I want to believe so.</t5287> <t5288>But we were let through, in pairs, and continued on our way.</t5288>
<t5289>After a while, turn right, go past the lilies towards the river.</t5289> <t5290>If only I could go all the way there, the garlic by the vast riverbank, where we used to lie in the sun, under the curved bridges.</t5290> <t5291>If you are willing to walk along the riverbank, following the winding paths, you will eventually reach the sea; but what is there to do when you get there?</t5291> <t5292>Pick up seashells, bask on the slippery rocks.</t5292>
<t5293>But we will not go to the river, will not see the dome-shaped houses along the road, the moonlight glistening with golden or blue hues, fresh and pure.</t5293> <t5294>Instead, we turn into a more modern building, with a large banner stretched across the entrance: DAY OF WOMEN'S CHARITY. The banner obscures the old name of the building, some former president who took a lead bullet.</t5294> <t5295>Below the red letters, there is a smaller line in black, flanked by two winged eye drawings: God is a national resource.</t5295> <t5296>The door is flanked by ever-present Guards: two pairs, four people, guns at their hips, eyes straight ahead.</t5296> <t5297>Almost like fashion models, hair neatly combed, uniforms crisply ironed, faces young and hard as plaster.</t5297> <t5298>But none of them had pimples.</t5298> <t5299>Each one had an automatic rifle within reach, ready to counter any dangerous or rebellious actions we might cause inside.</t5299>
<t5300>The ceremony will be held in a covered courtyard, a rectangular space with a glass roof.</t5300> <t5301>This time it’s not at the city level, that would be in a stadium; today it’s just within this district.</t5301> <t5302>Rows of wooden folding chairs have been arranged on the right side of the courtyard, reserved for the wives and daughters of officers or high-ranking officials, not much different from each other.</t5302> <t5303>The higher stands, with concrete railings, are for lower-ranking women, Marthas, and the thrifty Wives in multi-colored striped dresses.</t5303> <t5304>They are not required to attend the ceremony, especially if they are working or have small children, but the stands still seem crowded.</t5304> <t5305>I guess it’s also a form of entertainment, like watching a play or a circus.</t5305>
<t5306>Some ladies were already seated, wearing their finest embroidered blue dresses.</t5306> <t5307>You could feel their eyes on us as we walked past with our red couplets, heading to the opposite side.</t5307> <t5308>We were the subjects of scrutiny, appraisal, whispered judgments; it felt like a line of ants crawling on bare skin.</t5308>
<t5309>This side has no chairs. The area for us is cordoned off with a twisted red silk rope, like in old cinemas to keep customers out.</t5309> <t5310>That rope isolates us, marking quarantine, preventing infection from spreading to others, creating a sort of pen or cage; we just flow in, automatically forming lines, a habit we are very used to, and kneel down to sit on the cement floor.</t5310>
<t5311>“Get down to the end,” Ofglen murmured beside me.</t5311> <t5312>“It's easier to talk that way.” And while kneeling, head slightly bowed, I could hear a rustling all around, like the sound of insects chirping in tall dry grass: a dense whispering.</t5312> <t5313>This is one of the places where we can exchange freely, spreading news throughout the crowd.</t5313> <t5314>It’s hard for them to single out anyone in the group, or to hear what is being said.</t5314> <t5315>Moreover, they don’t want to interrupt the ceremony, especially in front of the television cameras.</t5315>
<t5316>Ofglen nudged my side, alerting me, and I looked up, very slowly and stealthily.</t5316> <t5317>From this spot, the entrance to the yard was quite clear, where everyone was steadily gathering.</t5317> <t5318>She must have noticed Janine, because there she was, with a new pair, not the previous one, someone I had never seen before.</t5318> <t5319>So Janine had been transferred, to a new household, a new assignment.</t5319> <t5320>Too soon, or perhaps her milk had gone bad?</t5320> <t5321>That was the only possibility, unless there was a dispute over the baby, which was not as uncommon as one might think.</t5321> <t5322>Once she had given birth, she might resist giving it away.</t5322> <t5323>That I could understand.</t5323> <t5324>Her body under the red fabric looked very thin, almost emaciated, the glow of pregnancy no longer there.</t5324> <t5325>Her face was pale and pointed, as if all the life had been drained out.</t5325>
<t5326>"It’s not pleasant at all, you know," Ofglen said close to my ear.</t5326> <t5327>"It turned into a shredder."</t5327>
<t5328>She was talking about Janine's child, the one who had passed by Janine on the way to somewhere else.</t5328> <t5329>The child's name was Angela.</t5329> <t5330>In the end, it was still a mistake, naming her so hastily.</t5330> <t5331>I felt a gnawing sensation in my stomach.</t5331> <t5332>Not gnawing, but empty.</t5332> <t5333>I didn't want to know what had gone wrong. "Oh God," I said.</t5333> <t5334>After going through all that, and ending up with nothing.</t5334> <t5335>Worse than nothing.</t5335>
<t5336>“That's the second one already,” said Ofglen. “Not counting the stepchild from before.</t5336> <t5337>She had a miscarriage at eight months, didn't you know?”</t5337>
<t5338>We watched intently as Janine walked into the middle of the circle, wrapped in misfortune, an untouchable veil.</t5338> <t5339>She saw me, she must have seen me, but she looked right through me.</t5339> <t5340>This time, no triumphant smile.</t5340> <t5341>She turned away, knelt down, and now I could only see her back and her slender, slanted shoulders.</t5341>
<t5342>“She thinks it's her fault,” Ofglen whispered. “Two times in a row.</t5342> <t5343>For committing a crime.</t5343> <t5344>She used the doctor, it's rumored, not the Commander of this house.”</t5344>
<t5345>I can't say I already knew, otherwise Ofglen would be surprised.</t5345> <t5346>As far as she knows, she herself is my only source of information on these kinds of things; things she understands astonishingly well.</t5346> <t5347>How does she know about Janine? Through the Marthas? The person paired with Janine for shopping?</t5347> <t5348>Eavesdropping behind doors, now the Ladies' tea and liquor hours, while setting traps.</t5348> <t5349>Would Serena Joy talk about me like that, if I were to follow her wishes?</t5349> <t5350>Instant nod, indeed she doesn't need to, just having two legs and a usable thing is more than enough.</t5350> <t5351>They don't know disgust, they don't have emotions like we do.</t5351> <t5352>And the rest of them on the bench craning their necks, oh my, how horrified and greedy they are.</t5352> <t5353>How? When? Where?</t5353>
<t5354>How Janine must have endured. "It's terrible," I said.</t5354> <t5355>But it is also true that Janine, indeed, has a habit of taking things upon herself, considering the child's disability to be her own fault.</t5355> <t5356>But people are willing to do anything to avoid admitting that their lives have no meaning.</t5356> <t5357>Useless, rather.</t5357> <t5358>No direction.</t5358>
<t5359>One morning, while changing clothes, I noticed that Janine was still wearing her white nightgown.</t5359> <t5360>She just sat there on the edge of the bed.</t5360>
<t5361>I looked out towards the double doors of the gymnasium, where the duty aunt usually stood, to see if she had noticed, but she wasn't there.</t5361> <t5362>By this time, they trusted us more, sometimes leaving us unsupervised in the classroom or even in the canteen for several minutes.</t5362> <t5363>She must have sneaked out for a cigarette or a cup of coffee.</t5363>
<t5364>Look, I told Alma, next to my bed.</t5364>
<t5365>Alma looked over at Janine.</t5365> <t5366>Then both of us went over there.</t5366> <t5367>Put your clothes on, Janine, Alma said to the white back.</t5367> <t5368>We don't want to have to pray more because of you.</t5368> <t5369>But Janine didn't move.</t5369>
<t5370>At this moment, Moira had also arrived.</t5370> <t5371>That was before she escaped, the next time.</t5371> <t5372>She was still limping, a consequence of the foot massage.</t5372> <t5373>She walked around the bed to look Janine directly in the face.</t5373>
<t5374>Come here, she told Alma and me.</t5374> <t5375>The others also began to gather around, forming a small crowd.</t5375> <t5376>Turn around, Moira told them.</t5376> <t5377>Don't make a fuss, what if she comes in now?</t5377>
<t5378>I still look at Janine.</t5378> <t5379>Her eyes are open, but she doesn't see me.</t5379> <t5380>Her eyes are round and wide, her teeth protruding between a motionless smile.</t5380> <t5381>Through the smile, through the gaps in her teeth, she is whispering to herself.</t5381> <t5382>I have to lean in close to hear.</t5382>
<t5383>Hello, she said, but not to me.</t5383> <t5384>I am Janine.</t5384> <t5385>I am your server this morning.</t5385> <t5386>May I bring you a cup of coffee to start?</t5386>
<t5387>Jesus, Moira said, beside me.</t5387>
<t5388>Don't swear, Alma said.</t5388>
<t5389>Moira grabbed Janine's shoulders and shook her hard.</t5389> <t5390>Snap out of it, Janine, she said rudely.</t5390> <t5391>And don't use that word.</t5391>
<t5392>Janine smiled.</t5392> <t5393>Now have a nice day, sir, she said.</t5393>
<t5394>Moira slapped her twice on the face, left, right.</t5394> <t5395>Come back here, she said.</t5395> <t5396>Come back here right now!</t5396> <t5397>You can't be there, you're not there anymore.</t5397> <t5398>It's over.</t5398>
<t5399>Janine's smile trembled.</t5399> <t5400>She raised her hand to her cheek.</t5400> <t5401>Why did you hit me? she said.</t5401> <t5402>Is that bad? I can bring out something else.</t5402> <t5403>You didn't have to hit me.</t5403>
<t5404>Do you know what they are going to do?</t5404> <t5405>Moira said.</t5405> <t5406>Her voice was small but sharp and determined.</t5406> <t5407>Look at me.</t5407> <t5408>I am Moira and this is the Red Center. Look at me.</t5408>
<t5409>Janine's eyes gradually focused.</t5409> <t5410>Moira? she said.</t5410> <t5411>I don't know any Moira.</t5411>
<t5412>They won't take you to the infirmary, so don't even dream about it, Moira said.</t5412> <t5413>They won't waste time trying to treat you.</t5413> <t5414>They won't even bother putting you on a ship to the Colonies.</t5414> <t5415>If you go too far, they'll take you straight to the Lab and shoot you dead.</t5415> <t5416>Then they'll burn your body in the dump, like an Unwoman.</t5416> <t5417>So forget about it.</t5417>
<t5418>I want to go home, Janine said.</t5418> <t5419>She started to sob.</t5419>
<t5420>Jesus Christ, Moira said.</t5420> <t5421>That's enough.</t5421> <t5422>She'll come in right now, I swear to you.</t5422> <t5423>Put on that damned outfit and shut up.</t5423>
<t5424>Janine kept whining, but she also got up and started putting on her shirt.</t5424>
<t5425>Next time it does that and I'm not here, Moira told me, you just slap it like that.</t5425> <t5426>You must not let it slip away.</t5426> <t5427>That thing spreads easily.</t5427>
<t5428>So, you are already planning how to escape at that moment.</t5428>
<t5429>34</t5429>
<t5430>The audience area was now full, and we waited with a rustling sound.</t5430> <t5431>At last, the Commander in charge of the ceremony also entered.</t5431> <t5432>His hair was thinning, and he was broad-shouldered; he looked like a former football coach past his prime.</t5432> <t5433>He was also dressed in a dark, black uniform, with rows of ranks and medals across his chest.</t5433> <t5434>It was hard not to be intimidated, but I tried: I imagined him in bed with his wife and a maidservant, thrusting wildly like a spawning salmon, pretending not to enjoy it.</t5434> <t5435>When God said to be fruitful and multiply, was He talking about this guy?</t5435>
<t5436>The Commander-in-Chief climbed each step up to the stage, stepping on the red fabric embroidered with a large white-winged eye spread across the floor.</t5436> <t5437>He cast his eyes around the room, and the faint murmuring gradually died down.</t5437> <t5438>He didn't even need to raise his hand.</t5438> <t5439>Then his voice came through the microphone and out the speakers, losing all the bass tones and leaving only a harsh metallic timbre, as if it wasn't formed from his mouth, from his body, but from the speakers themselves.</t5439> <t5440>The voice was tinged with metal, shaped like a whistle.</t5440>
<t5441>“Today is Thanksgiving,” he began, “a day of celebration.</t5441><t5442>”</t5442>
<t5443>I cover my ears to ignore the speech about victory and sacrifice.</t5443> <t5444>Then a long prayer, for the unworthy vessels, followed by the hymn: “There is balm in Gilead, to heal the wounded.</t5444><t5445>”</t5445>
<t5446>“There is balm in Gilead,” Moira often mimicked.</t5446>
<t5447>Now comes the main event.</t5447> <t5448>Twenty Angels enter, fresh from the front lines, impeccably groomed, escorted by the honor guard, marching one-two one-two into the central open space.</t5448> <t5449>Attention, rest.</t5449> <t5450>And now twenty veiled girls, all in white, shyly step forward, their mothers supporting their elbows.</t5450> <t5451>Now it is the mothers, not the fathers, who are responsible for giving away their daughters and assisting in arranging the marriage ceremony.</t5451> <t5452>Marriage is, of course, an arrangement.</t5452> <t5453>These girls have not been allowed to be alone with men for many years; the long years since this regulation began.</t5453>
<t5454>Will they be old enough to remember anything from the old days, practicing basketball, jeans with sneakers, riding bicycles?</t5454> <t5455>And reading books, with their own eyes?</t5455> <t5456>Even though some of them haven't turned fourteen yet - Starting very early, that's the policy, not a minute to waste - but they will remember.</t5456> <t5457>And the next generations will also remember, for another three or four or five years, but after that, they won't.</t5457> <t5458>They will wear white shirts, blending in with the girls from the dawn of time, they will be silent from the beginning.</t5458>
<t5459>We have given more than we have taken, the Commander said.</t5459> <t5460>Think back to the troubles you had before.</t5460> <t5461>Don't you remember, the single bars, the shameful matchmaking dates during school?</t5461> <t5462>A whole market of desperation.</t5462> <t5463>Don't you remember the vast gap between the girls who could easily find men and those who couldn't?</t5463> <t5464>How many people were desperate, starving themselves thin or filling their chests with silicon, cutting their noses but still couldn't get a decent face.</t5464> <t5465>Think of the human tragedy.</t5465>
<t5466>He waved his hand towards the stack of old magazines.</t5466> <t5467>Nothing but complaints.</t5467> <t5468>This problem, that problem.</t5468> <t5469>Remember those snippets in the Making Friends section, Fresh-faced women, thirty-five years old...</t5469> <t5470>This way, at least everyone has a man, no one is left childless.</t5470> <t5471>And then if they do get married, they might be left with a child, sometimes a few, just because the husband gets bored and disappears, they'll have to live on charity.</t5471> <t5472>Or he might stay and beat them to a pulp.</t5472> <t5473>Or if they go to work, leaving the child in daycare or in the hands of an ignorant and cruel woman, while they have to pay money, cutting into their meager wages.</t5473> <t5474>And at that time, money was the only measure of value, for everyone, even their mothers were not respected.</t5474> <t5475>No wonder they gradually gave up on having children.</t5475> <t5476>This way, at least they are protected, peacefully fulfilling their biological duty.</t5476> <t5477>Supported and encouraged by everyone.</t5477> <t5478>Now, tell me.</t5478> <t5479>You're so smart, I'd like to know what you think.</t5479> <t5480>What have we lost here?</t5480>
<t5481>Love, I said.</t5481>
<t5482>Love, huh? The commander said.</t5482> <t5483>What love?</t5483>
<t5484>The moment collapsed, I said.</t5484> <t5485>The commander looked at me with straightforward eyes, like a boy.</t5485>
<t5486>Ah right, he said.</t5486> <t5487>I do read the magazine, that's exactly what they keep pushing all day, isn't it?</t5487> <t5488>But look at the data, young lady.</t5488> <t5489>Is it really worth it, that whole thing?</t5489> <t5490>Arranged marriages always yield just as good results, if not better.</t5490>
<t5491>Love, Aunt Lydia said with disgust.</t5491> <t5492>Don't let me catch you in the act.</t5492> <t5493>Hey girls, this is not the place for dreamy flirtations.</t5493> <t5494>A finger raised in admonishment.</t5494> <t5495>The issue is not love.</t5495>
<t5496>Those years were merely off course, historically speaking, the Commander replied.</t5496> <t5497>They were just disasters.</t5497> <t5498>We only did the job of restoring the standards of Great Nature.</t5498>
<t5499>The wishes of women usually gather for collective weddings like this, often so.</t5499> <t5500>Men, on the other hand, gather for military victories.</t5500> <t5501>These are the events we should celebrate the most, in order of importance.</t5501> <t5502>However, sometimes women's gatherings are organized on the occasion of a nun leaving the convent.</t5502> <t5503>Most of these occurred long ago, during times when they were being hunted, but even now, a few are still unearthed, dug out from the underground world where they were hiding, like moles.</t5503> <t5504>They somewhat resemble that: squinting eyes, bewildered by the excess of light.</t5504> <t5505>The old women are immediately sent to the Colonies, but the younger ones who are still fertile are persuaded to convert, and if successful, we witness them at the ceremony, swearing to renounce their celibate life and dedicate themselves to the community's benefit.</t5505> <t5506>They kneel down, the Commander reads a prayer, and they receive the red veil, just like all of us did before.</t5506> <t5507>However, they are not allowed to become Wives; at this point, they are still considered too dangerous to be placed in such a position of power.</t5507> <t5508>They exude a witch-like aura, a strange mystical feeling, despite having been scrubbed, bearing the marks on their feet, and having spent some time in solitary confinement.</t5508> <t5509>They always receive those lash marks, always have to sit in confinement, according to rumors: they do not give up easily.</t5509> <t5510>Many would rather choose the Colonies.</t5510> <t5511>None of us want to pair up for daily shopping with them.</t5511> <t5512>They are more prone to breakdowns than the rest of us; being with them is never comfortable.</t5512>
<t5513>The mothers have arranged the daughters, veiled in white, into rows and returned to their seats.</t5513> <t5514>There were small sobs among them, hands patting and holding each other, handkerchiefs being pulled out and used noisily.</t5514> <t5515>The leader continued the ceremony:</t5515>
<t5516>“I want women to dress modestly,” he said, “with decency and propriety; not with elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, or expensive clothes;</t5516>
<t5517>"But rather good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to worship God."</t5517>
<t5518>“When listening to teachings, women must be silent and completely submissive.” Then he looked around at all of us.</t5518> <t5519>“Completely,” he repeated.</t5519>
<t5520>“I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.</t5520>
<t5521>"For Adam was formed first, then Eve."</t5521>
<t5522>“It was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.”</t5522>
<t5523>“However, the woman will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with propriety.</t5523><t5524>”</t5524>
<t5525>Saved by having children, I thought.</t5525> <t5526>So what did we think would save us, back then?</t5526>
<t5527>“He should preach that to the Wives,” Ofglen whispered, “while they’re busy guzzling cherry wine.”</t5527> <t5528>She was referring to the “temperance” part.</t5528> <t5529>It was safe to talk now, the Commander had finished the main ceremony and was now moving on to the ring and veil part.</t5529> <t5530>Wow, I thought.</t5530> <t5531>Look closely, because it’s too late already.</t5531> <t5532>The Angels will be eligible for Handmaids later, especially if the new Wives can’t conceive.</t5532> <t5533>But you girls are stuck.</t5533> <t5534>Take what you get, from sores onwards.</t5534> <t5535>But no one demands you to love him.</t5535> <t5536>You’ll understand soon enough.</t5536> <t5537>Just perform your duty in silence.</t5537> <t5538>Whenever in doubt, lying flat on the bed, you can still look up at the high ceiling.</t5538> <t5539>Who knows what you might see up there?</t5539> <t5540>Funeral wreaths and angels, constellations of dust, nebulae or non-nebulae, the forgotten patterns of spiders.</t5540> <t5541>There’s always something for a curious mind.</t5541>
<t5542>What's going on, my dear? The joke is old.</t5542>
<t5543>No, why?</t5543>
<t5544>You just moved.</t5544>
<t5545>Don't move, that's all.</t5545>
<t5546>What we aim for, Aunt Lydia said, is the spirit of camaraderie among women.</t5546> <t5547>We all must unite.</t5547>
<t5548>Teammate the Mercedes, Moira said through the wall hole.</t5548> <t5549>Talks like a charm, Aunt Lydia, as people often say.</t5549> <t5550>How much do you bet she makes Janine kneel on the floor?</t5550> <t5551>What do you think they do in that office?</t5551> <t5552>I bet her shriveled, dried-up thing has been used by that girl to do the trick...</t5552>
<t5553>Moira! I said.</t5553>
<t5554>Moira what Moira? she whispered.</t5554> <t5555>You thought so too, you know it.</t5555>
<t5556>Speaking like that isn't good at all, I said, but you still had to stifle your laughter.</t5556> <t5557>But I was still deceiving myself at that moment, thinking that I had to try to maintain something roughly like dignity.</t5557>
<t5558>You're always such a coward, Moira said, but with affection.</t5558> <t5559>There's a big difference.</t5559> <t5560>There is.</t5560>
<t5561>And she was right, now I understand, as I kneel on the hard ground that strikes my senses, listening to the tedious ceremony.</t5561> <t5562>There is something powerful in the whispered obscenities, aimed at the strong.</t5562> <t5563>There is something joyful, mischievous, hidden, forbidden, that makes one tremble with excitement.</t5563> <t5564>Just like a spell.</t5564> <t5565>It deflates them, brings them down to a manageable level.</t5565> <t5566>On the plaster wall of the restroom, an anonymous person had scrawled: Aunt Lydia sucks. It was the flag raised on the hill of rebellion.</t5566> <t5567>Just thinking about Aunt Lydia doing that is enough to warm the heart.</t5567>
<t5568>So I imagine the angels and those exhausted brides in their white dresses, amidst the glorious panting and sweat pouring down like a shower, the wet and hairy clashes; or even better, the miserable failures, with a penis like a three-week-old carrot, struggling to find its way on cold, unresponsive flesh like uncooked fish.</t5568>
<t5569>On the way out when the ceremony finally ended, Ofglen whispered in her usual light and sharp voice: "We know you still meet him in private.</t5569><t5570>"</t5570>
<t5571>"Who?" I said, trying to muster the strength to look at her.</t5571> <t5572>I know who it is.</t5572>
<t5573>"Your commander," she said.</t5573> <t5574>"We've known for a long time."</t5574> <t5575>I asked how she knew.</t5575>
<t5576>"We know, that's all," she said.</t5576> <t5577>"What does he want?</t5577> <t5578>Sadism, masochism?"</t5578>
<t5579>It's not easy to explain to her what he wants, because I myself haven't been able to name it yet.</t5579> <t5580>How can I recount what really happened?</t5580> <t5581>She will laugh, at the very least.</t5581> <t5582>It's simpler to say it like this, "Something like that." At least it sounds dignified for someone being coerced.</t5582>
<t5583>She pondered over this matter.</t5583> <t5584>"You would be surprised," she said, "if you knew how many people enjoy that."</t5584>
<t5585>“There's nothing I can do,” I said.</t5585> <t5586>“I can't say I don't want to go.”</t5586> <t5587>You should know that.</t5587>
<t5588>We had reached the sidewalk and talking was no longer safe, others were too close and the murmuring crowd no longer provided cover.</t5588> <t5589>We walked in silence, lagging behind, until she deemed it safe to say, "Of course, it's not possible."</t5589> <t5590>"But find out and tell us."</t5590>
<t5591>“What are you trying to find out?” I said.</t5591>
<t5592>I felt rather than saw her gently turn her head.</t5592> <t5593>"Anything that works."</t5593>
<t5594>35</t5594>
<t5595>Now there is an empty space to fill, amidst the overly warm atmosphere in the room, and time as well; a space-time, between Here and now and there then, ending with dinner.</t5595> <t5596>When the food tray arrives, carried up the stairs as if for an invalid.</t5596> <t5597>A waste product, something that has become useless.</t5597> <t5598>Worthless like a passport, with no way out.</t5598>
<t5599>That was what happened, the day we planned to escape, carrying brand new passports that indicated we were not who we used to be: that Luke, for instance, had never been divorced, that therefore we were legal, according to the law.</t5599>
<t5600>The police officer took the two passports inside, after hearing our explanation about going on a picnic and seeing our daughter sleeping in the car, amidst her tattered zoo.</t5600> <t5601>Luke gently patted my hand and went outside the car, pretending to stretch his legs, observing the other person through the immigration office window.</t5601> <t5602>I stayed in the car.</t5602> <t5603>I lit a cigarette, to calm myself, and took a long drag, feigning relaxation.</t5603> <t5604>I was observing two soldiers in unfamiliar uniforms, which by now had gradually become familiar; they were idly standing by the yellow and black striped barrier.</t5604> <t5605>They weren't doing much.</t5605> <t5606>One of them was watching a flock of birds, seagulls, circling and landing, then flying over the barrier behind.</t5606> <t5607>Watching him, I also looked at the flock of birds.</t5607> <t5608>Everything was still the same colors as before, only brighter.</t5608>
<t5609>It will be alright, I told myself, silently praying.</t5609> <t5610>Oh please. Let us through, let us through.</t5610> <t5611>Just this once, I will do anything.</t5611> <t5612>I thought of what I would do for anyone who was listening and could make any sense or even had any meaning, I would never know.</t5612>
<t5613>Then Luke got back into the car, in a hurry, turned the key, and reversed.</t5613> <t5614>He's on the phone, he said.</t5614> <t5615>Then he sped off, and soon we saw the dirt road with the forest, and we jumped out of the car and ran.</t5615> <t5616>A hut, to hide, a boat, we didn't even know what we were praying for anymore.</t5616> <t5617>He said the passports were perfectly secure, and we didn't have much time to prepare.</t5617> <t5618>Maybe he had prepared, had a kind of map in his head.</t5618> <t5619>As for me, I just had to run: run far, as far as possible.</t5619>
<t5620>I don't want to tell this story.</t5620>
<t5621>I don't necessarily have to tell.</t5621> <t5622>I don't have to tell anything, to myself or anyone else.</t5622> <t5623>I can sit right here, quietly.</t5623> <t5624>I can withdraw.</t5624> <t5625>I have the right to retreat deep inside, dive deep to the bottom, where they can never find me.</t5625>
<t5626>Don't let the bastards grind you down.</t5626> <t5627>How useful it would be for her to know.</t5627>
<t5628>What is the point of struggling?</t5628>
<t5629>It's not a big deal.</t5629>
<t5630>Love, huh? The commander has spoken.</t5630>
<t5631>This one is better.</t5631> <t5632>At least I am familiar with this one.</t5632> <t5633>Then we will talk about it.</t5633>
<t5634>When the moment came, I answered.</t5634> <t5635>Falling into it, all of us back then, no matter how.</t5635> <t5636>How could he take it so lightly? And even sneer.</t5636> <t5637>As if we were clinging to something trivial, a petty ornament, a whimsical fancy.</t5637> <t5638>In reality, on the contrary, it was very difficult.</t5638> <t5639>That was the key thing, the path through which one understands oneself; if one has never, ever encountered it, one would only be a monstrosity, a creature from outer space.</t5639> <t5640>Everyone knows this.</t5640>
<t5641>Fall, we say so; I make him fall.</t5641> <t5642>Fall, drop, descend, tumble.</t5642> <t5643>We are fallen women.</t5643> <t5644>We believe in it, in this downward motion: how lovely it is, like flying, yet how terrifying, extreme, and illusory it is.</t5644> <t5645>God is love, they used to say, but we have reversed it, and love, like bliss, is within reach.</t5645> <t5646>How difficult it is to love the person beside us, the more we believe in Love, an abstract and complete love.</t5646> <t5647>We wait, endlessly, longing for incarnation.</t5647> <t5648>The word becomes flesh.</t5648>
<t5649>And sometimes you also encounter it, for a moment.</t5649> <t5650>That love comes and goes, and later it's hard to remember, like a pain.</t5650> <t5651>Then one day, people will look at that person and think, I once loved him, and there is a word "once" there, which is utterly surprising, because such a thing "once" happened is truly astonishing and precarious and foolish; and people will also understand why their friends avoided them, back then.</t5651>
<t5652>What a relief it is now, when I think back on it.</t5652>
<t5653>Or sometimes, right in the midst of still loving, still falling, one wakes up in the middle of the night, when the moonlight through the window floods his sleeping face, making the eye sockets even darker and deeper than during the day, and one thinks, Who knows what they do, when alone or among a group of men?</t5653> <t5654>Who knows what they say or where they most often go?</t5654> <t5655>Who can tell who they really are? Beneath the everyday exterior.</t5655>
<t5656>And maybe at those times, people will think, What if he doesn't love me?</t5656>
<t5657>Or people will recall the stories they've read in the newspapers about missing women - usually women but sometimes men, or children, which is the worst - found in parks or forests, or in the refrigerators of abandoned apartments, either clothed or unclothed, violated or not; but all killed in the same way.</t5657> <t5658>There are areas people don't want to walk through, rooms where precautions are followed - locking windows or doors, drawing curtains, leaving lights on.</t5658> <t5659>People perform these actions like reciting prayers, doing them and hoping they will save themselves.</t5659> <t5660>And generally, they do save them.</t5660> <t5661>Or something has saved them; the fact that they are still alive is the immediate proof.</t5661>
<t5662>But those things only become evident when night falls, having nothing to do with the man one loves, at least in the daylight, because for that man, one would accept to train oneself, putting in the effort to practice.</t5662><t5663>Also practicing to have a beautiful body, one does it for the man one loves.</t5663><t5664>If one is willing to train oneself diligently, who knows, maybe he will too.</t5664><t5665>Who knows, maybe both will be able to train each other, like solving a puzzle together; otherwise, one of the two, often him, will drift away on his own path, leaving the other in a state of post-withdrawal struggle, wanting to cope by only increasing the training.</t5665><t5666>If practicing endlessly yields no results, it is because both have the wrong attitude.</t5666><t5667>Everything in life, one thinks, follows a certain positive or negative force originating from one's own mind.</t5667>
<t5668>If you don't like it, then change it, we say that, telling each other as well as telling ourselves.</t5668> <t5669>And so we change the man, taking another one.</t5669> <t5670>Change, we firmly believe, always brings better results.</t5670> <t5671>We are the ones who reconsider, we reconsider ourselves.</t5671>
<t5672>How strange it is to recall what we used to think in the past, as if everything was ready before our eyes, as if luck did not exist, no boundaries; as if we had the right to erase and redraw endlessly the ever-expanding circumference of our lives.</t5672> <t5673>I was like that too, I did the same.</t5673> <t5674>Luke was not the first man for me, and he might not have been the last.</t5674>
<t5675>If you had not been so paralyzed.</t5675> <t5676>Frozen in time, in midair, among the forest canopy there, in the midst of the fall.</t5676>
<t5677>In the past, people would receive a small package, personal belongings: the things left with them when they died.</t5677> <t5678>They often did so, during wartime, my mother said. How long should one mourn, and what did they say?</t5678> <t5679>Dedicate your life to remembering your loved ones.</t5679> <t5680>The old days.</t5680> <t5681>Beloved ones.</t5681>
<t5682>You are my beloved, I said loudly.</t5682> <t5683>Is, is, just two letters, you fool, can't you remember it, such a short word?</t5683>
<t5684>I wiped my face with my sleeve.</t5684> <t5685>There was a time I wouldn't dare do that, afraid it would smear, but now there's nothing left to smudge.</t5685> <t5686>If there is any expression on my face, even if I can't see it, it's genuine.</t5686>
<t5687>You will have to forgive me.</t5687> <t5688>I am a refugee from the past, and like all refugees in the world, I scrutinize the habits and customs of the lifestyle left behind, or forced to leave behind, and like them, I see how strange everything is when looking back from here, and just like that, they bewilder me.</t5688> <t5689>Like a White Russian sipping tea in the heart of Paris, abandoned in the twentieth century, I turn back, trying to find the distant paths; I become sentimental, losing myself.</t5689> <t5690>Sobbing. Sobbing is the right word, not crying.</t5690> <t5691>I sit here on the chair, drenched like a piece of sea foam.</t5691>
<t5692>So. Wait again, towards the future.</t5692> <t5693>Future mother: the welcoming call when entering a maternity store.</t5693> <t5694>The soon-to-be mother sounds like a call to give up a seat on the subway.</t5694> <t5695>Waiting is also a location, between two journeys.</t5695> <t5696>For me, it's this room.</t5696> <t5697>I am the empty space, here, between two parentheses.</t5697> <t5698>Among others.</t5698>
<t5699>There is the sound of the door wood.</t5699> <t5700>Cora and the tray.</t5700>
<t5701>But not Cora.</t5701> <t5702>"I brought it for you," Serena Joy said.</t5702>
<t5703>Then I looked around, got up from the chair, and walked over to her.</t5703> <t5704>She was holding it, the instant photo, square and glossy.</t5704> <t5705>So they still manufacture those cameras.</t5705> <t5706>And there will still be family photo albums, with all the kids; but not the maids.</t5706> <t5707>From the perspective of future history, at this rate, we will be invisible.</t5707> <t5708>But the kids will certainly be there, so the Wives have something to look at, downstairs, while nibbling on the buffet waiting for the Birth.</t5708>
<t5709>“You can only hold it for a minute,” Serena Joy whispered conspiratorially.</t5709> <t5710>“I have to put it back before they notice.”</t5710>
<t5711>He is someone Martha got for her.</t5711> <t5712>So there is a network of Martha connections, they also earned something from it.</t5712> <t5713>It's good to know.</t5713>
<t5714>I took it from her hand, turning it back towards myself.</t5714> <t5715>Is this me, is this my appearance?</t5715> <t5716>My precious.</t5716>
<t5717>Tall and very different.</t5717> <t5718>Already smiled a little, so quickly, wearing a white dress like the first communion, in the old days.</t5718>
<t5719>Time does not stop.</t5719> <t5720>It has pushed me, pushed me away, I am merely a sand woman left too close to the water's edge by a careless child.</t5720> <t5721>I have been cast aside for the sake of my child. I am nothing but a shadow, far behind the glossy surface of this photo.</t5721> <t5722>A shadow of a shadow, like all the mothers who have passed away.</t5722> <t5723>Just look into my child's eyes: I am not there.</t5723>
<t5724>But you exist, in a white dress.</t5724> <t5725>Growing up and living.</t5725> <t5726>Isn't that good?</t5726> <t5727>Isn't that a blessing?</t5727>
<t5728>Anyway, I can't stand it, being erased like that.</t5728> <t5729>I'd rather she didn't bring anything at all.</t5729>
<t5730>I sit at a tiny table, using a fork to eat creamed corn soup.</t5730> <t5731>I have a fork, a spoon, but never a knife.</t5731> <t5732>When there's meat, they cut it up for me beforehand, as if I lack teeth or don't know how to use my hands.</t5732> <t5733>But I have everything.</t5733> <t5734>That's why the knife never comes to me.</t5734>
<t5735>36</t5735>
<t5736>I knocked on his door, waited for a response, adjusted my expression, and walked in.</t5736> <t5737>He was standing by the fireplace, holding a nearly empty glass of wine.</t5737> <t5738>He usually waited for me to arrive before pouring strong liquor, even though I knew they had wine with dinner.</t5738> <t5739>His face was slightly red.</t5739> <t5740>I tried to estimate how much he had drunk.</t5740>
<t5741>"Hats off to you!" he said.</t5741> <t5742>"How is my little sister?"</t5742>
<t5743>Probably a few glasses, I guessed, thanks to the very skillfully crafted smile meant for me.</t5743> <t5744>He was still at the stage of refinement.</t5744>
<t5745>"I'm still fine," I said.</t5745>
<t5746>"Are you ready for a little fun trip?"</t5746>
<t5747>"I don't understand?" I asked again.</t5747> <t5748>Behind those antics, I sensed his embarrassment, hesitating, unsure of how far I would let him go, and in which direction.</t5748>
<t5749>“I have a little surprise for you tonight,” he said.</t5749> <t5750>He laughed, but it sounded more like a snort.</t5750> <t5751>I noticed that everything tonight was small.</t5751> <t5752>He wanted to shrink everything, including me.</t5752> <t5753>“You'll like it, just wait and see.”</t5753>
<t5754>“What is this?” I said.</t5754> <t5755>“Chinese checkers?” I allowed myself to speak like that; he seemed to enjoy this kind of rudeness, especially after a few drinks.</t5755> <t5756>He liked to see me being unrestrained.</t5756>
<t5757>"Even better," he said, trying to drive me crazy.</t5757>
<t5758>"I'm very anxious already."</t5758>
<t5759>"That's good," he said.</t5759> <t5760>He went to the table and rummaged through the drawer.</t5760> <t5761>Then he turned back to me, one hand hidden behind his back.</t5761>
<t5762>"Guess what," he said.</t5762>
<t5763>“Animal, plant, or mineral?” I asked.</t5763>
<t5764>"Oh, animals," he said, pretending to be serious. "And different animals too, I promise."</t5764> <t5765>He extended his hidden hand.</t5765> <t5766>In his hand, at first glance, was a handful of feathers, pinkish and purplish.</t5766> <t5767>Then he shook it out.</t5767> <t5768>A costume, clearly for women: two round pieces covering the chest, adorned with purple sequins.</t5768> <t5769>Each sequin was a tiny star.</t5769> <t5770>Feathers were attached around the thighs, around the chest.</t5770> <t5771>So I wasn't too far off about the corset.</t5771>
<t5772>I wonder where he got this thing from.</t5772> <t5773>Those kinds of clothes should have been destroyed.</t5773> <t5774>I still remember watching on TV, news clips from one city to another.</t5774> <t5775>In New York, the Great Manhattan Cleanup took place.</t5775> <t5776>Pyres sprung up in the middle of Times Square, crowds gathered around shouting, women raising their hands to the sky in gratitude whenever they felt the camera pointed at them, young men with bright and cold faces, constantly throwing armfuls of silk, nylon, and fake fur into the fire, in green, red, and purple; black satin, glittering silver fabric; two-piece lingerie, transparent bras embroidered with pink satin hearts covering the nipples.</t5776> <t5777>And the manufacturers, importers, and distributors knelt down, repenting before the public, wearing rolled-up paper hats like naughty children, with the words "Shame" printed in red.</t5777>
<t5778>But surely a few items escaped the fire, they couldn't track them all down.</t5778> <t5779>He probably got this from the same source as the pile of magazines, not through legitimate means: it reeks of the black market.</t5779> <t5780>And it's not new either, someone has worn it before, the fabric under the arms is creased and slightly stained, by the sweat of an unfamiliar woman.</t5780>
<t5781>“I have to guess the size,” he said.</t5781> <t5782>“Hopefully it fits.</t5782><t5783>”</t5783>
<t5784>"Do you think I would wear that thing?" I said.</t5784> <t5785>I knew my voice was very righteous, very indignant.</t5785> <t5786>But the prospect was indeed alluring.</t5786> <t5787>I had never worn anything even remotely like this, so glamorous and theatrical, and it must be, this must be theater costume, or from some performance at a long-dead nightclub; until now, the closest I had come was touching swimwear, with a tight cream-colored lace nightgown, once bought for me by Luke.</t5787> <t5788>But this outfit radiated a seductive charm, it held an allure like children being dressed up.</t5788> <t5789>How proud it would be to wear it, how it would mock the aunts, how sinful, how free.</t5789> <t5790>Freedom, like everything, is only relative.</t5790>
<t5791>"Um," I said, not wanting to appear too eager.</t5791> <t5792>I wanted him to feel like he was receiving a favor from me.</t5792> <t5793>Now it's time, here comes the deep desire.</t5793> <t5794>Does he have a riding crop hidden behind that door?</t5794> <t5795>Will he pull out boots, or make himself or me bend over the table?</t5795>
<t5796>“This is a disguise outfit,” he said.</t5796> <t5797>“You also have to put on makeup; I have the stuff here.</t5797> <t5798>Otherwise, you'll never get in.”</t5798>
<t5799>"Where to?" I asked.</t5799>
<t5800>"Tonight, I will take you out."</t5800>
<t5801>"Play?" The word is too outdated.</t5801> <t5802>Obviously, there is no place, no longer, for a man to take a woman - to play.</t5802>
<t5803>"Playing very far," he said.</t5803>
<t5804>I immediately understood that this proposal was dangerous, for him, but above all for me, but despite everything, I still wanted to go.</t5804> <t5805>I wanted anything that would break the daily monotony, overturn the accepted and respected order.</t5805>
<t5806>I said I didn't want to be watched while putting this on; I was still embarrassed in front of him, because of my body.</t5806> <t5807>He said he would turn his back, and he did just that, and I took off the shoes and socks and the pile of cotton underwear, and slipped into the feathers, under the loose petticoat.</t5807> <t5808>Then I took off the dress, pulling the delicate beaded straps over my shoulders.</t5808> <t5809>There were shoes too, peach-colored, with unusually high heels.</t5809> <t5810>Nothing fit quite right; the shoes were a bit too big, the waist a bit too tight, but it was all fine.</t5810>
<t5811>"Done," I said, and he turned around.</t5811> <t5812>I felt awkward, I wanted to look in the mirror.</t5812>
<t5813>“Unparalleled in the world,” he said.</t5813> <t5814>“Now for the face.”</t5814>
<t5815>The entire makeup kit he had consisted of an old, melted lipstick with a chemical grape smell, along with a bit of eyeliner and mascara.</t5815> <t5816>No eyeshadow, no blush.</t5816> <t5817>For a moment, I thought I had forgotten what to do with them and initially ended up with a black smudge like soot, as if I had just been in a fight, but I wiped it off with some cheap lotion and tried again.</t5817> <t5818>I dabbed a bit of lipstick on my cheeks and blended it evenly.</t5818> <t5819>From start to finish, he held a large silver-framed mirror in front of me.</t5819> <t5820>I realized it belonged to Serena Joy. He must have borrowed it from her room.</t5820>
<t5821>My hair can't do anything.</t5821>
<t5822>"Perfect," he said.</t5822> <t5823>By this time, he was already very excited; it was just like getting ready for a party.</t5823>
<t5824>He went to the closet to get the cloak, which had a hood.</t5824> <t5825>Bright blue, the color of the Wives.</t5825> <t5826>This too must have belonged to Serena.</t5826>
<t5827>“Pull the hat down to cover your face,” he said. “Remember not to smudge the makeup.</t5827> <t5828>This is to get through the checkpoint.</t5828><t5829>”</t5829>
<t5830>“But what about the pass?” I asked.</t5830>
<t5831>"Don't worry," he said.</t5831> <t5832>"I found it for you."</t5832>
<t5833>And so, we set off.</t5833>
<t5834>We crossed the street together as darkness fell.</t5834> <t5835>The Commander held my right hand, like two teenagers going to the movies.</t5835> <t5836>I clutched my sky-blue coat tightly around me, like a dignified Lady.</t5836> <t5837>Through the gap in my hat, I could see Nick's nape.</t5837> <t5838>His hat was straight, his back was straight, his nape was straight, his whole body was rigid.</t5838> <t5839>Was his posture showing discontent towards me, or was I imagining it?</t5839> <t5840>Did he know what I was wearing under this coat, or did he turn it out himself?</t5840> <t5841>And if so, would he be angry or lustful or jealous, or feel anything at all because of it? We had one thing in common: we both needed to be invisible, existing only within our duties.</t5841> <t5842>I didn't know if he understood.</t5842> <t5843>When he opened the car door for the Commander, and incidentally for me, I tried to catch his eye, to make him look at me, but he acted as if he didn't see me there. Why?</t5843> <t5844>His job was too light, just running errands, assisting with trivial matters, there's no way he wanted to cause trouble for it.</t5844>
<t5845>The checkpoint was easy to pass through, everything went smoothly just as the Commander said, even though my heart was pounding and the blood in my head was rushing.</t5845> <t5846>Moira would definitely call me a scaredy-cat.</t5846>
<t5847>Passing the second checkpoint, Nick said, "Here, sir?" and the Commander nodded</t5847><t5848>.</t5848>
<t5849>The car pulled over to the side and the Commander said, "Now I need you to get down on the floor of the car.</t5849><t5850>"</t5850>
<t5851>"Down to the floor of the car?" I asked.</t5851>
<t5852>“We are about to go through the gate,” he said, as if that was enough explanation.</t5852> <t5853>I tried to ask where we were going, but he said he wanted to surprise me. “Wives are not allowed through.”</t5853>
<t5854>So I lay flat and the car continued to move, then for a few minutes I saw nothing.</t5854> <t5855>The coat was suffocatingly hot.</t5855> <t5856>It was a winter coat, not a summer cotton coat, reeking of mothballs.</t5856> <t5857>He must have borrowed it from the storage, knowing she wouldn't notice.</t5857> <t5858>He had carefully moved his feet to make room for me, but my forehead still pressed against his shoes.</t5858> <t5859>I had never seen his shoes so close before.</t5859> <t5860>The shoes were stiff, without a crease, like beetle shells: black, polished, impenetrable. They seemed to have nothing to do with feet.</t5860>
<t5861>Passing through another checkpoint.</t5861> <t5862>I hear a voice, respectful, and the electric door opens down and up to present the pass.</t5862> <t5863>This time, there is no paper of mine, the paper considered to be mine, because I no longer officially exist, at this moment.</t5863>
<t5864>Then the car moved again, stopped again, and I saw the Commander help me up.</t5864>
<t5865>“We have to hurry,” he said.</t5865> <t5866>“This is the back door.</t5866> <t5867>You can leave the coat for Nick.</t5867> <t5868>Same time, as always,” he said to Nick. So this had happened before as well.</t5868>
<t5869>He helped me take off my cloak; the car door was left open.</t5869> <t5870>I felt the air on my nearly bare skin and realized I had been sweating.</t5870> <t5871>When I turned back to close the car door, I saw Nick looking straight at me through the window.</t5871> <t5872>Now he had seen me.</t5872> <t5873>Was that contempt or indifference?</t5873> <t5874>Did he expect nothing more from me?</t5874>
<t5875>We are in the alley behind a building, built with red bricks, relatively modern.</t5875> <t5876>A row of trash cans is placed by the door, with a faint smell of fried chicken, going stale, the leader has the key, opens the bare, gray door, level with the wall and - I think - made of iron.</t5876> <t5877>Inside is a bare concrete corridor lit by neon lights, a kind of specialized tunnel.</t5877>
<t5878>"Come here," the Commander said.</t5878> <t5879>He looped a tag around my wrist, purple in color, with an elastic band, like an airport luggage tag.</t5879> <t5880>"If anyone asks, tell them you were hired for one night," he instructed.</t5880> <t5881>He grabbed my bare upper arm and pushed me forward.</t5881> <t5882>I just wanted a mirror to see if my lipstick was in place, if the feathers were too gaudy, too disheveled.</t5882> <t5883>Under this light, I must look quite ghostly.</t5883> <t5884>Though it was already too late.</t5884>
<t5885>You fool, Moira said.</t5885>
<t5886>37</t5886>
<t5887>We followed the corridor through another gray round door and then another corridor, this time dimly lit and carpeted, pinkish-brown, mushroom-colored.</t5887> <t5888>Doors opened on both sides, each numbered: one hundred and one, one hundred and two, like people counting in a storm to see how close the lightning has struck.</t5888> <t5889>So it turned out to be a hotel.</t5889> <t5890>From behind one of the doors came laughter, the voices of both men and women.</t5890> <t5891>It had been a long time since I had heard that.</t5891>
<t5892>Stepping out of the hallway, we found ourselves in the central courtyard.</t5892> <t5893>The courtyard was very spacious and tall too: extending up several floors to the glass dome above.</t5893> <t5894>In the middle, a round fountain sprayed water in all directions like a dandelion in seed.</t5894> <t5895>Trees in the planters and on the courtyard sprouted everywhere, with vines hanging down from the balconies.</t5895> <t5896>Oval-shaped glass-walled elevators crawled along the walls like giant naked snails.</t5896>
<t5897>I know where this is.</t5897> <t5898>I have been here before: with Luke, in the afternoons, from a long time ago.</t5898> <t5899>This was a hotel, back then.</t5899> <t5900>Now there are only women.</t5900>
<t5901>I stood still in one place and watched them.</t5901> <t5902>I could look to my heart's content, here, all around, with no white wings to block my view.</t5902> <t5903>My head, having its wings clipped, became unusually light, as if a heavy mass, a chunk of matter, had been cut away.</t5903>
<t5904>The women were sitting, lounging around, or walking, leaning against each other.</t5904> <t5905>There were also men with them, many men, but dressed in military uniforms or black suits, looking identical, they just formed a background.</t5905> <t5906>In contrast, the women were vibrant in tropical colors, wearing countless festive and dazzling outfits.</t5906> <t5907>Some dressed like me, with bright feathers and beads, high-slit skirts, and deeply cut necklines.</t5907> <t5908>Some wore vintage-style lingerie, thigh-length nightgowns, baby doll dresses, and a few in sheer lace dresses.</t5908> <t5909>Some were in swimsuits, one-piece or two-piece; one person, I noticed, wore crocheted yarn, with two large shells covering her nipples.</t5909> <t5910>Some wore running shorts and backless tops, some in exercise outfits often seen on TV in the past, tight-fitting, with light-colored knitted leg warmers.</t5910> <t5911>There were even some dressed like cheerleaders, in short plaid skirts, with large letters across their chests.</t5911> <t5912>They probably had to accept this eclectic collection, whatever could still be scavenged.</t5912> <t5913>Everyone was made up, and now I realized how unaccustomed I had become to seeing makeup, because their eyes seemed too big, too deep, and too sparkling, their mouths too red, too wet, glistening with bright blood; or thinking another way, too much like clowns.</t5913>
<t5914>At first glance, the whole scene looks so cheerful.</t5914> <t5915>Like a masquerade party; there are oversized children, dressed up in costumes dug out from the bottom of chests and trunks.</t5915> <t5916>Is it fun?</t5916> <t5917>Perhaps, but is it their choice?</t5917> <t5918>How can one know just by looking?</t5918>
<t5919>In the room, there were countless butts on display.</t5919> <t5920>I am no longer familiar with them.</t5920>
<t5921>“It's like stepping into the past,” the Commander said.</t5921> <t5922>He seemed pleased, even delighted.</t5922> <t5923>“Isn't it?”</t5923>
<t5924>I try to remember if the past was really like this.</t5924> <t5925>I'm not sure anymore.</t5925> <t5926>I know all these things were in it, but the proportions have somehow changed.</t5926> <t5927>A film about the past is still not the past.</t5927>
<t5928>"Yes," I said.</t5928> <t5929>My feelings were not a singular thing.</t5929> <t5930>Of course, I was not bewildered by those women, not horrified.</t5930> <t5931>I considered them deserters.</t5931> <t5932>The official doctrine denied them, denied the very fact of their existence, but they were still here. At least that meant something.</t5932>
<t5933>“Don't stare like that,” the Commander said.</t5933> <t5934>“You'll give yourself away.</t5934> <t5935>Just act natural.”</t5935> <t5936>Once again, he pulled me along.</t5936> <t5937>Someone had noticed him, greeted him, and started walking towards us.</t5937> <t5938>The Commander's hand tightened around my arm.</t5938> <t5939>“Stay still,” he whispered.</t5939> <t5940>“Don't panic.”</t5940>
<t5941>All your task, I told myself, is to keep your mouth shut tightly and put on a dumb face.</t5941> <t5942>It's not that hard.</t5942>
<t5943>The commander took over the conversation for me, with this person and the ones that followed.</t5943> <t5944>He didn't say much about me, as there wasn't much to say.</t5944> <t5945>He just mentioned that I was new, and they looked at me and then moved on to discuss other matters.</t5945> <t5946>The disguise had done its job.</t5946>
<t5947>He still held my hand, and as we talked, his back straightened almost imperceptibly, his chest expanded, and his voice grew increasingly lively and youthful.</t5947> <t5948>I suddenly realized he was showing off.</t5948> <t5949>He was showing me off, in front of them, and they understood, they were also quite formal, their hands and feet still, but they were still appraising my chest, my thighs, as if there was no reason to do otherwise.</t5949> <t5950>But he was also showing off to me.</t5950> <t5951>He was performing, showing me how he dominated the world.</t5951> <t5952>He was breaking the rules, right under their noses, sticking his tongue out at them, without facing any consequences.</t5952> <t5953>Perhaps he had reached that state of delusion that is said to arise from power, believing himself to be an indispensable figure who could do anything, everything he wanted, anything at all.</t5953> <t5954>Twice, thinking no one saw, he winked at me.</t5954>
<t5955>This performance is so childish, and pitiful too; but I understand it.</t5955>
<t5956>When he felt it was enough, he pulled me along to a floating floral-patterned sofa, the kind often seen in hotel lobbies in the old days; in this lobby, exactly, I remember this decorative motif, dark blue background with pink flowers in an art nouveau style.</t5956> <t5957>"I think your feet must be tired," he said, "because of those shoes."</t5957> <t5958>That was true, and I felt grateful.</t5958> <t5959>He placed me to sit down, and sat next to me himself.</t5959> <t5960>He wrapped his arm around my shoulder.</t5960> <t5961>The fabric rubbed against my skin, causing a slight burning sensation; recently, it had lost the habit of being touched.</t5961>
<t5962>"What?" he said.</t5962> <t5963>"What do you think of this little club?"</t5963>
<t5964>I looked around once more.</t5964> <t5965>This number of men was not as diverse as I initially thought.</t5965> <t5966>By the water fountain, there was a group of Japanese people, wearing light gray fabric vests, and in the distant corner, glimmering in the moonlight: Arabs, in long bathrobes, head coverings, and striped headbands.</t5966>
<t5967>“That club?” I said.</t5967>
<t5968>"Oh, we call it that, among ourselves.</t5968> <t5969>'To the club'."</t5969>
<t5970>“I thought this was absolutely forbidden,” I said.</t5970>
<t5971>"Well, in theory, that's correct," he said.</t5971> <t5972>"But everyone is human, right."</t5972>
<t5973>I waited for him to delve deeper into this topic, but he didn't, so I said, "What do you mean?"</t5973>
<t5974>“It means you cannot outsmart Nature,” he said.</t5974> <t5975>“Nature demands diversity, with men.</t5975> <t5976>That makes sense, it’s part of the strategy to maintain the species.</t5976> <t5977>That is Nature’s arrangement.”</t5977> <t5978>I didn’t say anything, so he continued.</t5978> <t5979>“Women know this instinctively.</t5979> <t5980>Why did they need to buy so many different clothes in the past?</t5980> <t5981>To trick the man into thinking that these are many different women.</t5981> <t5982>A new woman every day.”</t5982>
<t5983>He spoke as if he was certain, but there were many other things he said in that manner.</t5983> <t5984>He might believe, he might not, or he might believe both at the same time.</t5984> <t5985>It was impossible to guess what he believed.</t5985>
<t5986>"And now we no longer have different clothes," I said, "then you have different women, it's that simple."</t5986> <t5987>Quite sarcastic, but he didn't admit it.</t5987>
<t5988>“It solves a lot of things,” he said, without blinking.</t5988>
<t5989>I did not respond.</t5989> <t5990>I was gradually getting fed up with him.</t5990> <t5991>I wanted to give him the cold shoulder, staying silent and sulking from now until we got back.</t5991> <t5992>But I couldn't do it and I knew that.</t5992> <t5993>After all, tonight was supposed to be a night out.</t5993>
<t5994>I really do want to talk to the women, but the chances seem to be approximately zero.</t5994>
<t5995>"Who are they?" I asked.</t5995>
<t5996>“This place is only for officers,” he said.</t5996> <t5997>“Of all branches, and high-ranking civilian officials.</t5997> <t5998>And trade delegations too, of course.</t5998> <t5999>This promotes commerce.</t5999> <t6000>It's very convenient to meet the people you need to meet here.</t6000> <t6001>Without this place, it would be hard to do business.</t6001> <t6002>We strive to provide services at least on par with everywhere else.</t6002> <t6003>You can also eavesdrop on many things, all kinds of news.</t6003> <t6004>People sometimes tell women things they can't tell others.</t6004><t6005>”</t6005>
<t6006>“No,” I said.</t6006> <t6007>“I was asking those women.”</t6007>
<t6008>"Ah," he said.</t6008> <t6009>"Let's see, some of them are professionals.</t6009> <t6010>The girls in the industry," he laughed, "from the old days.</t6010> <t6011>They can't be integrated; but anyway, most of them prefer this place."</t6011>
<t6012>“What about the rest?”</t6012>
<t6013>“The rest?” he said.</t6013> <t6014>“Well, we have quite a collection.</t6014> <t6015>Over there, wearing the blue dress, she is a sociologist.</t6015> <t6016>In the past.</t6016> <t6017>This one is a lawyer, that one a businesswoman, an executive of some sort; it seems like a chain of fast-food restaurants, or maybe hotels.</t6017> <t6018>I've heard that talking to her is quite interesting, if you just want to have a conversation.</t6018> <t6019>They all prefer this place too.” “Prefer it to what?” I asked.</t6019>
<t6020>“More than other choices,” he said.</t6020> <t6021>“Who knows, maybe you too would prefer it, compared to now.”</t6021> <t6022>He seemed bashful, he was fishing for compliments, and I knew the serious conversation had come to an end.</t6022>
<t6023>“I'm not sure,” I said, as if considering.</t6023> <t6024>“It might be tough.”</t6024>
<t6025>"You have to watch your weight, that's for sure," he said.</t6025> <t6026>"It's very strict here.</t6026> <t6027>Gain five pounds, and you're invited to solitary confinement."</t6027> <t6028>Is he joking?</t6028> <t6029>It seems so, but I don't want to know.</t6029>
<t6030>"Now then," he said, "to blend in with the general atmosphere, how about a small drink?"</t6030>
<t6031>“I am not allowed,” I said.</t6031> <t6032>“You know that.”</t6032>
<t6033>“One glass won't kill anyone,” he said.</t6033> <t6034>“And anyway, not drinking looks very unusual.</t6034> <t6035>There are no bans on alcohol, beer, or cigarettes here! You see, they are quite privileged.”</t6035>
<t6036>"Alright then," I said.</t6036> <t6037>Deep down, I liked that suggestion; I hadn't had a sip in years.</t6037>
<t6038>“So what is this?” he said.</t6038> <t6039>“Everything is here.</t6039> <t6040>Imported goods.</t6040><t6041>”</t6041>
<t6042>“Gin and tonic,” I said.</t6042> <t6043>“But please make it light.</t6043> <t6044>I don't want to embarrass you.”</t6044>
<t6045>“That’s not true,” he said, grinning widely.</t6045> <t6046>He stood up, then, quite unexpectedly, took my hand and kissed the palm.</t6046> <t6047>Then he left, heading to the bar.</t6047> <t6048>He could have called a waitress, there were a few of them, all in black mini skirts with two large pom-poms on their chests, but they seemed too busy to wave back.</t6048>
<t6049>Then I saw her. Moira.</t6049> <t6050>She was standing with two other women, by the fountain.</t6050> <t6051>I had to strain my eyes, once more, to be sure it was her; my eyes darting quickly, so no one would notice.</t6051>
<t6052>She wore a bizarre outfit, made of satin that must have once been shiny but had become frayed from frequent wear.</t6052> <t6053>There were no straps, with an internal frame to lift the chest, but it didn't fit Moira well, the top was too loose, causing one breast to bulge while the other did not.</t6053> <t6054>She was absentmindedly tugging at the hem of her top, pulling it up.</t6054> <t6055>There was a tuft of cotton attached to her back, visible when she slightly turned; it looked like a sanitary pad that had been put in a popcorn machine and popped. I realized that it was supposed to be a tail.</t6055> <t6056>On her head were two ears, either rabbit or deer, it was unclear, one of which had lost its frame or starch, flopping over in half.</t6056> <t6057>She wore a black bow tie around her neck, long black fishnet stockings, and black high heels.</t6057> <t6058>She used to absolutely hate high heels.</t6058>
<t6059>That attire, both archaic and bizarre, reminds me of something that once existed, but I can't quite recall what it is.</t6059> <t6060>A play, a musical comedy?</t6060> <t6061>Girls dressed up for Easter, like bunnies.</t6061> <t6062>What does it symbolize here, why are bunnies considered alluring in the eyes of men?</t6062> <t6063>What is attractive about this tattered outfit?</t6063>
<t6064>Moira is smoking.</t6064> <t6065>She takes a drag, then passes the cigarette to the person on her left, adorned with red beads and a long pointed tail, with silver horns: a devilish girl.</t6065> <t6066>Now she crosses her arms in front of her chest, below her large, cumbersome bra.</t6066> <t6067>She stands on one leg, then switches legs, her legs probably hurt; her spine slightly curved.</t6067> <t6068>She glances around the room, neither excited nor expectant.</t6068> <t6069>The scene is all too familiar.</t6069>
<t6070>I hope she looks at me, sees me, but her eyes slide past me like every brush, every chair in the room.</t6070> <t6071>Surely she has to turn back, I hope so much, she has to look at me, before any man comes to her, before she disappears.</t6071> <t6072>Right now the person on the right, the blonde girl wearing a pink, fur-trimmed nightgown that's already worn out, has been taken away, has entered the elevator, has vanished.</t6072> <t6073>Moira turns her head again, perhaps looking for a prospect.</t6073> <t6074>Standing there unacknowledged makes her very uncomfortable, like being at a school dance, unnoticed by anyone.</t6074> <t6075>This time her gaze stumbles upon me.</t6075> <t6076>She sees me.</t6076> <t6077>She is smart enough not to react.</t6077>
<t6078>We looked at each other, our faces still indifferent and emotionless.</t6078> <t6079>Then she slightly moved her head, gently shaking it to the right.</t6079> <t6080>She took back the cigarette from the girl in the red dress, brought it to her mouth, her hand pausing in mid-air for a moment, five fingers spread wide.</t6080> <t6081>Then she turned her back to me.</t6081>
<t6082>Signals from the past.</t6082> <t6083>Within five minutes, I have to go to the women's restroom, somewhere to her right.</t6083> <t6084>I looked around: couldn't recognize where it was.</t6084> <t6085>Couldn't risk standing up and walking randomly, without the Commander beside me.</t6085> <t6086>I'm not familiar with this place, don't know the way, what if I have to give my name?</t6086>
<t6087>One minute, two minutes.</t6087> <t6088>Moira indifferently walked away, not glancing sideways.</t6088> <t6089>She could only hope I understood and would follow.</t6089>
<t6090>The wolf leader returned, carrying two glasses.</t6090> <t6091>He smiled at me, placed the glasses on the long black coffee table next to the sofa, and sat down. "Having fun?" he asked.</t6091> <t6092>He wanted me to be happy.</t6092> <t6093>After all, this was a reward.</t6093>
<t6094>I laughed in response. "Is there a toilet here?" I asked.</t6094>
<t6095>"Yes," he said.</t6095> <t6096>He took a sip.</t6096> <t6097>He did not suggest any directions.</t6097>
<t6098>“I need to go.” My head is counting, not minutes, but each tick of the clock.</t6098>
<t6099>"Right over there," he jerked his head.</t6099>
<t6100>“What if someone stops me?”</t6100>
<t6101>"Just present the card," he said.</t6101> <t6102>"It's alright.</t6102> <t6103>They will know you are accompanied."</t6103>
<t6104>I stood up, unsteadily walked across the room.</t6104> <t6105>I was a bit wobbly, near the fountain, almost fell. Because of the high heels.</t6105> <t6106>Without the Commander to steady me, I lost my balance.</t6106> <t6107>A few men glanced over, their looks more peculiar than desirous.</t6107> <t6108>I felt terribly foolish.</t6108> <t6109>I blatantly extended my left hand in front of me, elbow bent, card facing outward.</t6109> <t6110>No one said anything.</t6110>
<t6111>38</t6111>
<t6112>I found the entrance to the restroom, still marked with the Women's sign, the golden letters elegantly styled.</t6112> <t6113>A long corridor led from the outside to the door, with a woman sitting at a desk outside, controlling the entry and exit.</t6113> <t6114>An elderly woman, wearing a purple caftan, with gold eye shadow, but I still recognized her as an aunt.</t6114> <t6115>A cattle prod on the table, the strap wrapped around her wrist.</t6115> <t6116>Don't expect to mess around.</t6116>
<t6117>"Fifteen minutes," she told me.</t6117> <t6118>She handed me a long purple card, there was a stack of them on the table.</t6118> <t6119>Just like a fitting room, in the stores of the past.</t6119> <t6120>I heard her speaking to the person behind, "You just went in."</t6120><t6121>"</t6121>
<t6122>“I need to go too,” the other person said.</t6122>
<t6123>“Take a break every hour,” the gatekeeper aunt replied.</t6123> <t6124>“You know the rules.”</t6124>
<t6125>The woman insisted, her voice whining and pleading.</t6125> <t6126>I pushed the door open.</t6126>
<t6127>I still remember this place.</t6127> <t6128>Besides being a resting room, dimly lit with pink lights, a few soft chairs and a sofa with a light green bamboo shoot pattern, there was a clock on the wall with an intricately carved gold frame.</t6128> <t6129>The mirror here is not removed; there is a long one opposite the sofa.</t6129> <t6130>Here, people need to know how they look.</t6130> <t6131>Beyond the arched doorway is a row of pink-colored restrooms, with sinks and more mirrors.</t6131>
<t6132>There were a few women sitting on chairs and sofas, shoes off, smoking.</t6132> <t6133>They all looked up when I walked in.</t6133> <t6134>There was a smell of perfume and exhaled smoke, and the scent of sweaty skin.</t6134>
<t6135>“New here?” someone asked.</t6135>
<t6136>"New," I said, looking around for Moira, who was nowhere to be seen.</t6136>
<t6137>No one laughed.</t6137> <t6138>They continued smoking as if it were an extremely serious matter.</t6138> <t6139>In the inner room, a person dressed as a catgirl with a fake orange tail was touching up their makeup.</t6139> <t6140>This place felt like a backstage: lip balm, cigarette smoke, all the materials needed for an illusion.</t6140>
<t6141>I hesitated, not knowing what to do.</t6141> <t6142>I didn't want to ask about Moira, unsure if it was safe.</t6142> <t6143>Then there was the sound of a flush, and Moira stepped out from behind a pink door.</t6143> <t6144>She stumbled closer, and I waited for a signal.</t6144>
<t6145>“It's okay,” she said, to me and to everyone else.</t6145> <t6146>“I know her.”</t6146> <t6147>Now everyone laughed, and Moira hugged me tightly.</t6147> <t6148>My arms wrapped around her, her bra's underwire poking into me.</t6148> <t6149>We kissed each other, left cheek then right cheek.</t6149> <t6150>Then we both stepped back.</t6150>
<t6151>"Damn it," she said.</t6151> <t6152>She grinned.</t6152> <t6153>"You look like the Whore of Babylon."</t6153>
<t6154>“Isn't that what I need?” I said.</t6154> <t6155>“You look like a bird's nest.</t6155><t6156>”</t6156>
<t6157>"Honestly," she said, adjusting her chest, "it doesn't suit me, and this one is already worn out. I wish they could find someone who still knows how to sew this kind of thing.</t6157> <t6158>That way I could have something that looks a bit decent.</t6158><t6159>"</t6159>
<t6160>"Did you choose it yourself?" I asked.</t6160> <t6161>I thought maybe she had picked it out, among countless items, the one with the least frills.</t6161> <t6162>After all, it was only black and white.</t6162>
<t6163>“No, with the devil as my witness,” she said.</t6163> <t6164>“Military supplies.</t6164> <t6165>I guess they figured out it was me.</t6165><t6166>”</t6166>
<t6167>I still can't believe it's really her.</t6167> <t6168>I touch her hand again.</t6168> <t6169>Then cry.</t6169>
<t6170>“Don't cry,” she said. “Your eyes will get all puffy.</t6170> <t6171>It won't make it in time anyway.</t6171> <t6172>Scoot over.” This was said to the two people on the sofa, in her usual rude and bossy manner, and as usual, they complied immediately.</t6172>
<t6173>“Anyway, my time is up,” one person said, wearing a light blue "merry widow" corset and white stockings.</t6173> <t6174>She stood up and shook my hand.</t6174> <t6175>“Nice to meet you,” she said.</t6175>
<t6176>The other person obediently moved aside, and the two of us sat down.</t6176> <t6177>The first thing we did was take off our shoes.</t6177>
<t6178>"What the hell are you doing here?" Moira asked. "Not that I'm not happy to see you.</t6178> <t6179>But you shouldn't be happy.</t6179> <t6180>What crime did you commit? Laughing out loud when you saw the old man's dick</t6180><t6181>?"</t6181>
<t6182>I looked up at the ceiling. "Are there any bugs?" I said.</t6182> <t6183>I carefully wiped around my eyes with my fingertips.</t6183> <t6184>Black eyeliner smudged everywhere.</t6184>
<t6185>"Ninety percent," Moira said. "Want a smoke?"</t6185>
<t6186>"Very willing," I said.</t6186>
<t6187>"Hey," she said to the person next to her.</t6187> <t6188>"Lend me a cigarette, okay?"</t6188>
<t6189>The other person handed it over immediately, without complaining.</t6189> <t6190>Moira is still as good at persuading as ever.</t6190> <t6191>She makes me smile.</t6191>
<t6192>“But it might not be,” she continued.</t6192> <t6193>“I can't think of anything we could say that would bother them.</t6193> <t6194>Most of it they've already heard, and anyway, no one leaves here except in the black van.</t6194> <t6195>But you must know that if you've been here.”</t6195> <t6196>I pulled her head close and whispered in her ear.</t6196> <t6197>“I'm just here temporarily,” I said.</t6197> <t6198>“Just for tonight.</t6198> <t6199>I'm not supposed to be here at all.</t6199> <t6200>He snuck me in.”</t6200>
<t6201>“Who is it?” she whispered back.</t6201> <t6202>“That stinky old man next to you? I tried him before, he's really as bad as leprosy.”</t6202>
<t6203>“That is my Chief,” I said.</t6203>
<t6204>She nodded. "Some guys do that, thinking it's really funny.</t6204> <t6205>It's like wrestling on the altar: you guys are supposed to be the epitome of virtue.</t6205> <t6206>They want to see how you would look all dolled up.</t6206> <t6207>It's just a cheap display of power.</t6207><t6208>"</t6208>
<t6209>I have never looked at it this way.</t6209> <t6210>I tried to match it with the Commander, but it seemed too simple, too crude for him.</t6210> <t6211>Surely, he has much more subtle motives.</t6211> <t6212>But it could also be that my arrogance led me to think so.</t6212>
<t6213>“We don't have much time,” I said. “Tell me everything.”</t6213>
<t6214>Moira shrugged. "What's the use?" she said.</t6214> <t6215>But she also knew it was useful, so she told.</t6215>
<t6216>She had recounted, had whispered like this, or nearly so.</t6216> <t6217>I don't remember every word exactly, as there was no way to write it down.</t6217> <t6218>I tried my best to fill in the gaps: there wasn't much time, so she only gave a general overview.</t6218> <t6219>She also had to tell it in two sessions; we managed to get another break at the same time.</t6219> <t6220>I tried to make it as much like her as possible.</t6220> <t6221>It's also a way to keep her alive.</t6221>
<t6222>"I left that Elizabeth woman tied up like a Christmas turkey behind the stove.</t6222> <t6223>I really wanted to kill her, but now I'm glad I didn't, otherwise I would have faced a much worse situation.</t6223> <t6224>I couldn't believe it was so easy to get out of the Center.</t6224> <t6225>Put on that brown outfit and I just walked right through.</t6225> <t6226>Kept walking as if I knew exactly where I was going, until I was out of sight.</t6226> <t6227>I didn't have any grand plan; it was not organized at all, like they thought, even though when they tried to pry, I made up all sorts of things.</t6227> <t6228>You would too if you were electrocuted and subjected to other stuff.</t6228> <t6229>You don't need to know what you're spewing out.</t6229>
<t6230>“I kept my shoulders straight and my chin up as I walked, trying to think of what to do.</t6230> <t6231>When they flattened the printing house, most of the women I knew had already been arrested, and the rest were probably caught by now.</t6231> <t6232>I'm sure they have a list.</t6232> <t6233>We were really foolish to think we could continue as before, even underground, even after moving all our stuff out of the office into basements and side rooms.</t6233> <t6234>So I better not go to those houses.</t6234>
<t6235>"I vaguely know where I am in the city, even though the street I'm walking on seems unfamiliar."</t6235> <t6236>"But by looking at the sun, I can guess where North is. After all, scout camp has some benefits."</t6236> <t6237>"I think it's best to keep going straight and see if I can reach the Main Square or somewhere around there."</t6237> <t6238>"That way, I can be sure of my location."</t6238> <t6239>"Besides, I think it's better for people to see me heading straight into the center rather than wandering around."</t6239> <t6240>"It looks more trustworthy."</t6240>
<t6241>“They have set up more checkpoints since we entered the Center, they're everywhere.</t6241> <t6242>The first one almost made me piss myself.</t6242> <t6243>I suddenly ran into it just as I turned.</t6243> <t6244>I knew that turning back in the middle of the street would look very suspicious, so I just boldly walked through, just like at the gate, frowning, puffing out my chest, and sneering at them, like they were festering boils.</t6244> <t6245>Remember how those aunts looked when they pronounced the word 'man'.</t6245> <t6246>Like magic, I passed through, and the subsequent checkpoints were the same.</t6246>
<t6247>“But the brain in my skull was spinning.</t6247> <t6248>I only had a little bit of time before they discovered the old bat and raised the alarm.</t6248> <t6249>Just a little more and they would hunt me down: a fake aunt, on foot.</t6249> <t6250>I tried to think of someone, I went over and over the people I knew.</t6250> <t6251>Finally, I tried to remember if there was anything left from the company's directory.</t6251> <t6252>It had been destroyed, of course, from the beginning; and not exactly destroyed, we had divided it up and each of us memorized a part, then destroyed it.</t6252> <t6253>Back then we still sent letters, but we no longer printed the logo on the envelopes.</t6253> <t6254>The risk had been increasing all the time.</t6254>
<t6255>"So I tried to remember my part.</t6255> <t6256>I won't tell you which names I chose, I don't want them to get into trouble, in case they haven't already. It's also possible that I spilled everything out, I can't remember what I said when they pulled that trick.</t6256> <t6257>You would say all sorts of things.</t6257>
<t6258>“I chose them because they are a married couple, and it would be safer than someone who is single, especially if they are homosexual.</t6258> <t6259>Moreover, I still remember the symbol under their name.</t6259> <t6260>Q, which means Quaker. We note down all religious signs if any, for convenience during protests.</t6260> <t6261>That way, we can determine who will attend which event.</t6261> <t6262>For instance, don't call the C group for abortion matters; of course, there aren't many of those organized these days.</t6262> <t6263>I also remember their address.</t6263> <t6264>We have drilled these addresses into each other, it's crucial to remember them accurately, starting from the postal code.</t6264>
<t6265>"At this point, I reached Mass Avenue and knew where I was.</t6265> <t6266>And I also knew where they were.</t6266> <t6267>Now I had another concern: if these people saw a woman entering the yard, would they lock the door and pretend no one was home?</t6267> <t6268>But no matter what, I had to take the risk; this was my only chance.</t6268> <t6269>I guessed that the likelihood of them shooting me was low.</t6269> <t6270>It was nearly five in the afternoon, I was tired from walking, especially in that damned soldier's gait, straight as a stick, and I hadn't eaten anything since morning.</t6270>
<t6271>“What I obviously didn't know was that in those early days, few people knew about the aunts and even the Center itself.</t6271> <t6272>At first, it was an absolute secret, behind the barbed wire fence.</t6272> <t6273>There might have been some opposition to what they were doing, even at that time.</t6273> <t6274>So even if people saw those strange aunts wandering around, they still didn't know exactly what those women were up to.</t6274> <t6275>Everyone probably thought they were some kind of military nurses.</t6275> <t6276>By now, people had learned to stop asking questions, unless absolutely necessary.</t6276>
<t6277>“So the homeowner let me in right away.</t6277> <t6278>The one who opened the door was the wife.</t6278> <t6279>I told her I was conducting a survey.</t6279> <t6280>I said that so she wouldn't be too surprised, in case someone was watching.</t6280> <t6281>But as soon as I got inside, I took off the scarf and revealed who I really was.</t6281> <t6282>They could very well have called the police or something, I knew I was taking a risk, but I had no choice.</t6282> <t6283>But in any case, they didn't call.</t6283> <t6284>They gave me clothes, the wife's dress, and burned the maid's uniform and my ID in the fireplace; they knew this couldn't be delayed.</t6284> <t6285>They didn't want me there, that was obvious, they were extremely tense.</t6285> <t6286>They had two children, both under seven years old.</t6286> <t6287>I understood their feelings.</t6287>
<t6288>“I went to the bathroom, oh how relieved I felt.</t6288> <t6289>The bathtub was filled with plastic fish and other things. Then I went upstairs, sat in the children's room, and played with the kids and a puzzle set while their parents were downstairs discussing what to do with me.</t6289> <t6290>At that time, I didn't feel panicked; on the contrary, I felt very happy.</t6290> <t6291>The thought of fate, you could say.</t6291> <t6292>Then the wife made me a sandwich with a cup of coffee while the husband said he would take me to another house.</t6292> <t6293>They didn't dare to pick up the phone.</t6293>
<t6294>“That house was also Quaker, and I turned out to strike gold, because they were a station on the Women's Underground Railroad.</t6294> <t6295>When the other person returned, they said they would take me abroad.</t6295> <t6296>I won't give you the details, because some stations might still be operational.</t6296> <t6297>Each station only connects with one other station, which is the next one in line.</t6297> <t6298>This has its advantages - when caught in a net for example - but also disadvantages, because if one station is raided, the whole line is halted until contact is made with a courier capable of establishing a new route.</t6298> <t6299>However, they are better organized than you might imagine.</t6299> <t6300>They have managed to infiltrate some useful places; among them is the post office.</t6300> <t6301>There, they have a driver with a quite handy small truck.</t6301> <t6302>I got through the gate into the inner city in a mail sack.</t6302> <t6303>I can tell you this because they caught him a little while later.</t6303> <t6304>He eventually ended up on the Wall.</t6304> <t6305>You hear all about these things; in here you hear a lot, surprisingly so.</t6305> <t6306>The Commanders themselves say it, I guess they think it doesn't matter, we wouldn't bother to go anywhere, except to each other, and that doesn't count.</t6306>
<t6307>"I said it sounded easy, but it really wasn't.</t6307> <t6308>From start to finish, I almost crapped my pants.</t6308> <t6309>One of the hardest things was understanding that these strangers were risking their lives for me when they didn't have to.</t6309> <t6310>But they said they were doing it for religious reasons and I shouldn't take it personally.</t6310> <t6311>That made it a bit easier.</t6311> <t6312>Every night they would pray silently.</t6312> <t6313>At first, it was hard for me to get used to that because it was too much like the crap at the Center.</t6313> <t6314>It made me want to puke, to be honest with you.</t6314> <t6315>I had to try really hard, reminding myself that this was completely different.</t6315> <t6316>At first, I hated it intensely.</t6316> <t6317>But I think that's what supported them.</t6317> <t6318>They also had a rough idea of what would happen if they got caught.</t6318> <t6319>Not in detail, but they knew.</t6319> <t6320>By that time, TV had started showing some things, trials and so on.</t6320>
<t6321>“That was before the official crackdown on heretical sects began.</t6321> <t6322>As for declaring yourself a bit Christian and married, meaning at the beginning, you would still be relatively left alone by them.</t6322>
<t6323>At first, they focused on the fringe group.</t6323> <t6324>They didn't realize that after dealing with that group, they would eventually look at everyone else.</t6324>
<t6325>"I had to hide for about eight or nine months."</t6325> <t6326>"I was moved from place to place, to different safe houses, there were still many of those back then."</t6326> <t6327>"Not all of them were Quakers, some didn't even believe in religion."</t6327> <t6328>"They were just people who didn't want to see things like that happening, that's all."</t6328>
<t6329>“We almost succeeded.</t6329> <t6330>They took me all the way to Salem, then hid in a chicken truck to Maine.</t6330> <t6331>The smell almost made me puke; have you ever imagined being crapped on by a whole truckload of chickens, each one getting carsick?</t6331> <t6332>They planned to get me across the border there, not by car or truck, which had become too difficult, but by boat, following the coastline up.</t6332> <t6333>I didn't know until the night of the operation, they never said what they were going to do next until right before it started.</t6333> <t6334>They were that cautious.</t6334>
<t6335>"So I don't know what happened.</t6335> <t6336>Maybe someone suddenly felt a chill, or some outsider suddenly became suspicious.</t6336> <t6337>Or maybe it's because of the boat; perhaps they thought the boatman was going out too often at night.</t6337> <t6338>At that hour, there were probably Eyes everywhere, on the boat, as well as anywhere near the border.</t6338> <t6339>Whatever the reason, they caught us just as we were leaving through the back door to the boat dock.</t6339> <t6340>Me and the boatman, and his wife too.</t6340> <t6341>They were an old couple, around fifty years old.</t6341> <t6342>He worked in the shrimp industry, that was before the fishing industry here ran into these troubles.</t6342> <t6343>I don't know what happened to them afterward, because they took me away in a separate vehicle.</t6343>
<t6344>"I think it's over for me."</t6344> <t6345>"Either go back to the Center under Aunt Lydia's supervision and the steel cable."</t6345> <t6346>"She loves it, you know."</t6346> <t6347>"She pretends to love the sinner but hate the sin, but she loves it."</t6347> <t6348>"I've also thought about ending it myself, and if there was a way, I probably would have done it."</t6348> <t6349>"But there were two people sitting in the truck with me, watching me like hawks; not saying a word, just sitting there glaring at me."</t6349> <t6350>"So it's hopeless."</t6350>
<t6351>“But the car did not go back to the Center, it went somewhere else.</t6351> <t6352>I will not tell what happened next.</t6352> <t6353>I do not want to talk about it.</t6353> <t6354>I can only say that they left no trace.</t6354>
<t6355>“When it was all done, they showed me a movie.</t6355> <t6356>Do you know what movie?</t6356> <t6357>A movie about life in the Ghetto area.</t6357> <t6358>In the Ghetto area, people just scrub all day long.</t6358> <t6359>Lately, their minds are really focused on cleaning.</t6359> <t6360>Sometimes it's just corpses, after some fighting.</t6360> <t6361>Coming out of the ghettos is the worst, they are left there longer, they decompose more horribly.</t6361> <t6362>These guys don't like scattered corpses, they fear disease or something.</t6362> <t6363>So the women in that Ghetto area handle the cremation.</t6363> <t6364>Other areas are even worse, with toxic waste dumps or radioactive leaks.</t6364> <t6365>They calculate that you only get three years at most in those places, then your nose will fall off and your skin will peel like rubber gloves.</t6365> <t6366>They don't even bother to feed you enough, or provide protective clothing or anything, it's cheaper not to.</t6366> <t6367>But anyway, it's all people they want to get rid of.</t6367> <t6368>They say there are other areas, not too bad, where people do farming: growing cotton or tomatoes and so on.</t6368> <t6369>But not in the movie I watched.</t6369>
<t6370>“Those are middle-aged women - I bet you were wondering why you haven't seen any old ladies around lately - and the Handmaids who have failed three times, and the unruly ones like me.</t6370> <t6371>The whole lot of them, all rejects.</t6371> <t6372>They're all infertile, of course.</t6372> <t6373>If they weren't like that from the start, they'd become that way after being there for a while.</t6373> <t6374>Whenever there's any doubt, they put you on the operating table, so no one is wasted.</t6374> <t6375>It's also worth mentioning that there are about a handful of men in the Colonies too.</t6375> <t6376>Not every traitor ends up on the Wall.</t6376>
<t6377>“Everyone was wearing the traditional long dress, like at the Center, except it was gray.</t6377> <t6378>Both women and men, in several group scenes.</t6378> <t6379>I guess it was meant to mock the men, because they had to wear women's clothes.</t6379> <t6380>For me, that alone is already quite mocking.</t6380> <t6381>How can anyone tolerate that? In every aspect, I prefer this outfit more.</t6381>
<t6382>“So then, they told me I was too dangerous to be given the honor of returning to the Red Center. They said I would spread depravity.</t6382> <t6383>I was given a choice, they said, this or the Colonies.</t6383> <t6384>Well, heck, only a nun would choose the Colonies.</t6384> <t6385>You understand, I wasn't planning on being a martyr.</t6385> <t6386>If I had been sterilized long ago, I wouldn't even need surgery anymore.</t6386> <t6387>No one here has functioning ovaries anyway, you can see how that would be troublesome.</t6387>
<t6388>“So I came here.</t6388> <t6389>They even give out face cream.</t6389> <t6390>You’ll have to find some way to get in here.</t6390> <t6391>You’ll have three or four years of happiness before it wears you down and you get thrown out to the cemetery.</t6391> <t6392>The food is decent and you can indulge in drinking or injecting, if you like, and you only have to work at night.”</t6392>
<t6393>“Moira,” I said. “You didn't mean that.” She really frightened me, her tone so indifferent, so devoid of will. So they had actually done it, taken away something - what? - that used to be her essence?</t6393> <t6394>And how could I demand that she move forward, according to my own image of her courage, live by it, embody it, when I myself could not?</t6394>
<t6395>I don't want you to become like me.</t6395> <t6396>Giving up, going with the flow, saving your own life.</t6396> <t6397>As you can see, it is an inevitable outcome.</t6397> <t6398>I want you to be resilient, brave, heroic, and fight valiantly.</t6398> <t6399>Which I couldn't do.</t6399>
<t6400>“Don't worry about me,” she said.</t6400> <t6401>She must have guessed a little of what I was thinking. “I'm still here, you see, it's really me.</t6401> <t6402>But anyway, let's consider this: it's not bad, surrounded by so many women.</t6402> <t6403>It's a paradise of lesbians, what else could it be.”</t6403>
<t6404>Now she is teasing, appearing cheerful, I feel relieved.</t6404> <t6405>"Did they approve?" I asked.</t6405>
<t6406>“Approval, huh? Damn them, it's more like encouragement.</t6406> <t6407>Do you know what they call this place among themselves? Jezebel's Palace.</t6407> <t6408>They say that since we're all going to hell anyway, they've given up. No matter what sinful games we play, it's all the same. And the Commanders don't care what we do during our breaks.</t6408> <t6409>Anyway, whether it's the girls upstairs or downstairs, it gets those guys pretty excited.”</t6409>
<t6410>“What about those people?”</t6410>
<t6411>“Let me put it this way,” she said, “they are not too crazy about men.”</t6411> <t6412>She shrugged again.</t6412> <t6413>It could also be resignation.</t6413>
<t6414>Here are the stories I want to tell.</t6414> <t6415>I want to tell how Moira escaped, this time for good.</t6415> <t6416>Or if not that, I want to say she blew up Jezebel's, with fifty Commanders inside.</t6416> <t6417>I want her to end with a daring and spectacular act, a frenzy, a gesture worthy of her.</t6417> <t6418>But as far as I know, nothing of the sort happened.</t6418> <t6419>I don't know what her fate was, or if it even came, because I never saw her again.</t6419>
<t6420>39</t6420>
<t6421>The commander has the key to the private room.</t6421> <t6422>He got it from the reception desk while I sat on the sofa waiting.</t6422> <t6423>He showed it to me, cunningly.</t6423> <t6424>I had to understand on my own.</t6424>
<t6425>We followed the half-glass egg upwards, past the balconies covered in vines.</t6425> <t6426>I had to understand that I was being exhibited.</t6426>
<t6427>He opened the door to the room.</t6427> <t6428>Everything was still the same, just like back then, a long, long time ago.</t6428> <t6429>The curtains were still the same, thick with floral patterns to match the bedspread, orange poppies on a dark blue background, with a thin white layer outside for blocking the sun when needed; a small wardrobe, a nightstand, square and impersonal; a few lamps; a few paintings on the wall: fruit in a bowl, stylized apples, flowers in a vase, buttercups and purple dandelions matching the curtains.</t6429> <t6430>Everything was still the same.</t6430>
<t6431>I told the Commander to wait a moment, then went into the bathroom.</t6431> <t6432>My ears were ringing because of the smoke, and the glass of wine made me feel weak.</t6432> <t6433>I soaked a bath towel in water and pressed it to my forehead for a while.</t6433> <t6434>Then I looked around to see if there was a small bar of soap in any of the packages.</t6434> <t6435>There were a few.</t6435> <t6436>The kind with a picture of a gypsy girl, Spanish-made.</t6436>
<t6437>I deeply inhaled the scent of soap into my lungs, that disinfectant scent, and stood in the white-tiled room listening to the distant sound of flushing water, the toilet just flushed.</t6437> <t6438>Strangely, I felt calm, as if I were at home.</t6438> <t6439>The toilet brought a sense of reassurance.</t6439> <t6440>Bodily functions are at least still democratic.</t6440> <t6441>Everyone shits, as Moira would say.</t6441>
<t6442>I sat on the edge of the bathtub, looking at the plain white rolls of towels.</t6442> <t6443>At one time, they would have excited me.</t6443> <t6444>They once symbolized the aftershocks of love.</t6444>
<t6445>I saw your mother, Moira said.</t6445>
<t6446>Where? I asked.</t6446> <t6447>My stomach tightened, dizzy.</t6447> <t6448>I realized I still considered my mother to be dead.</t6448>
<t6449>It's not outside, it's in the movie they are showing, that immigrant area.</t6449> <t6450>There is a close-up shot, it really looks like you.</t6450> <t6451>You are trapped in that gray thing but I recognized you.</t6451>
<t6452>Thank God, I said.</t6452>
<t6453>What, thank God? Moira said.</t6453>
<t6454>I think mom is dead.</t6454>
<t6455>Sometimes dying is even better, Moira said.</t6455> <t6456>You should pray for that for your uncle.</t6456>
<t6457>I don't remember what the last time I saw my mother was like.</t6457> <t6458>That day blended into all the other days, just another trivial occasion.</t6458> <t6459>Probably, my mother stopped by the house; she was always like that, rushing in and out of my house, as if I were the mother and she were the child.</t6459> <t6460>She was still as enthusiastic as before.</t6460> <t6461>Many times, during the transition between apartments, either moving in or moving out, she would bring clothes to use my washer-dryer combo.</t6461> <t6462>Maybe that day she came to borrow something from me: pots, a hairdryer.</t6462> <t6463>That was another habit of hers.</t6463>
<t6464>I didn't know it was the last time, otherwise I would have remembered it better.</t6464> <t6465>I don't even remember what we talked about.</t6465>
<t6466>A week later, two weeks, then three weeks, when the situation suddenly worsened, I tried calling my mother.</t6466> <t6467>But no one answered, even when I called again.</t6467>
<t6468>Mom didn't say where she was planning to go, but there have been times like this before: she doesn't always inform us.</t6468> <t6469>Mom has her own car and isn't too old to drive.</t6469>
<t6470>Finally, I was able to call the building manager.</t6470> <t6471>He said he hadn't seen my mother in a long time.</t6471>
<t6472>I panicked.</t6472> <t6473>I thought maybe mom had a heart attack or a stroke, something fatal, even though as far as I knew she hadn't been ill lately.</t6473> <t6474>Mom was always strong and healthy.</t6474> <t6475>She still worked out at Nautilus and went swimming twice a week.</t6475> <t6476>I often told my friends that she was healthier than me, and I might not be wrong.</t6476>
<t6477>Luke drove me into the city and intimidated the manager to the point of opening the apartment door.</t6477> <t6478>She could be dead on the floor, Luke said.</t6478> <t6479>The longer you wait, the worse it will get.</t6479> <t6480>Don't you think it will start to smell?</t6480> <t6481>The manager said something about needing a permit, but Luke can be very persuasive at times.</t6481> <t6482>He made him understand that we had no intention of waiting or leaving.</t6482> <t6483>And I cried.</t6483> <t6484>Perhaps that was the deciding factor.</t6484>
<t6485>When the door opened, a scene of chaos unfolded before our eyes.</t6485> <t6486>Chairs and tables were overturned, cushions were ripped apart, drawers were upended on the floor, and belongings were scattered in piles.</t6486> <t6487>But my mother was nowhere to be seen.</t6487>
<t6488>I'm calling the police, I said.</t6488> <t6489>I wasn't crying anymore; I was cold from head to toe, my teeth chattering.</t6489>
<t6490>Don't, Luke said.</t6490>
<t6491>Why? I said.</t6491> <t6492>I stared at him, I was furious.</t6492> <t6493>He stood amidst the wreckage in the living room, just looking at me.</t6493> <t6494>He put his hands in his pockets, one of those meaningless gestures people make when they don't know what else to do.</t6494>
<t6495>That's enough, I only said that.</t6495>
<t6496>Your mom is fierce, Moira often said, back in college.</t6496> <t6497>Later: you are really fiery.</t6497> <t6498>Then later: you are really lovely.</t6498>
<t6499>My mom doesn't "love," I said.</t6499> <t6500>My mom is my mom.</t6500>
<t6501>Oh my, Moira said, you haven't seen my old lady.</t6501>
<t6502>I think of my mother, sweeping away deadly toxins; just like people used to make old women in Eastern Europe sweep the ground.</t6502> <t6503>Except this ground will kill my mother.</t6503> <t6504>I can't believe it.</t6504> <t6505>Surely my mother's stubbornness, optimism, and enthusiasm, her fire, will help her get out.</t6505> <t6506>She will figure out a way.</t6506>
<t6507>But I know it's not like that.</t6507> <t6508>It's just shifting the burden, as children often do, onto the mother.</t6508>
<t6509>I had time to mourn my mother.</t6509> <t6510>But I will mourn again, and again.</t6510>
<t6511>I call myself back, here, this hotel.</t6511> <t6512>This is where I need to be.</t6512> <t6513>Now, in the wide mirror under the white light, I look at how I appear.</t6513>
<t6514>I examine myself very carefully, slowly, and balanced.</t6514> <t6515>I look really miserable.</t6515> <t6516>The mascara has clumped again, despite Moira fixing it, the purplish lipstick is smudged, and my hair is a mess.</t6516> <t6517>The outfit is overdue for a change, looking gaudy like a costume party puppet, with some sequins missing.</t6517> <t6518>It's very likely they were gone from the start and I didn't notice.</t6518> <t6519>I'm like a theatrical performer, crudely made up in borrowed clothes, dazzling but cheap.</t6519>
<t6520>If only there were a toothbrush.</t6520>
<t6521>I could just stand here thinking about it, but time is passing.</t6521>
<t6522>I have to be home before midnight, otherwise I'll turn into a pumpkin, or was it a carriage?</t6522> <t6523>Tomorrow is the Monthly Ceremony, according to the calendar, so Serena wants me to serve tonight, and if I'm not there, she'll find out the reason, then what?</t6523>
<t6524>And the Commander is waiting, to change the atmosphere, I hear footsteps moving around the room.</t6524> <t6525>Now he stops by the bathroom door, clears his throat, skillfully lets out a gentle cough.</t6525> <t6526>I turn on the hot water faucet, showing that I am ready or almost ready.</t6526> <t6527>This matter must be finished.</t6527> <t6528>I wash my hands.</t6528> <t6529>Must be cautious of the risk of stagnation.</t6529>
<t6530>When I came out, he was already lying on the oversized bed, shoes off, I noticed.</t6530> <t6531>I lay down beside him, without needing to be told.</t6531> <t6532>I didn't want this; but lying down was good, I was extremely tired.</t6532>
<t6533>In the end, it's just the two of us, I thought, the problem is I don't want to be alone with him at all, especially not in bed.</t6533> <t6534>I'd rather have Serena here.</t6534> <t6535>I'd rather play Scrabble.</t6535>
<t6536>But I remained silent, not making him hesitate.</t6536> <t6537>"Tomorrow, isn't it?" he whispered.</t6537> <t6538>"I was thinking we could play a little before the bell." He turned to me.</t6538>
<t6539>“Why did you bring me here?” I said coldly.</t6539>
<t6540>At this moment, he is caressing my body, from head to toe as they say, a cat's stroke along the left side, down the left leg.</t6540> <t6541>When he reaches the foot, he stops, his fingers encircle the ankle, for a moment, like a shake, embracing the tattoo, a Braille letter he can read, a cattle brand mark.</t6541> <t6542>That letter means ownership.</t6542>
<t6543>I remind myself that he is not unkind; remind that, in different circumstances, I might even like him.</t6543>
<t6544>The hand paused.</t6544> <t6545>“I thought maybe you would like a change of pace.” He also knew that wasn't enough. “I think it's also a kind of experiment.”</t6545> <t6546>That still wasn't enough.</t6546> <t6547>“You said you wanted to know.”</t6547>
<t6548>He sat up and began to unbutton.</t6548> <t6549>Would it be worse when he was stripped, all that silk-like authority?</t6549> <t6550>Now he had gotten down to his shirt, and, sadly, beneath it, a very small belly.</t6550> <t6551>A few strands of hair fluttering.</t6551>
<t6552>He slipped one strap of my shirt off, slid his other hand into the feathers, but it was useless, I lay there stiff as a bird struck by an arrow.</t6552> <t6553>He is not a demon, I thought.</t6553> <t6554>I couldn't maintain pride or disgust, there were a hundred things that needed to be let go of, in this situation.</t6554>
<t6555>“Perhaps I should turn off the light,” the Commander said, troubled and clearly offended.</t6555> <t6556>I caught a glimpse of him before the light went out.</t6556> <t6557>Without the uniform, he looked thin, old, as if dried out.</t6557> <t6558>The trouble is, I cannot do anything different beside him than I usually do.</t6558> <t6559>Usually, I just sit idly.</t6559> <t6560>There must be something more here, not just awkwardness and uselessness.</t6560>
<t6561>Pretend, I shouted in my head.</t6561> <t6562>You have to remember how to do it. If you don't finish this, you'll be here all night.</t6562> <t6563>Move, damn it.</t6563> <t6564>Shift your body, breathe loudly.</t6564> <t6565>At least you have to do that.</t6565>
<t6566>XIII - Night</t6566>
<t6567>40</t6567>
<t6568>The nighttime heat is more unbearable than the daytime heat.</t6568> <t6569>Even with the fan on, nothing moves, the four walls accumulate heat, sweltering like an old oven.</t6569> <t6570>It will probably rain soon.</t6570> <t6571>What do I want rain for? Rain will only add more humidity.</t6571> <t6572>There is distant lightning but no thunder.</t6572> <t6573>I see the lightning when I look out the window, faintly flickering, like phosphorescence in a stormy sea, the other side of the sky filled with low-hanging clouds, emitting a dull infrared glow.</t6573> <t6574>The floodlights have gone out, an unusual occurrence, a power cut.</t6574> <t6575>Or Serena Joy's arrangement.</t6575>
<t6576>I sit in the dark; turning on the light is useless, announcing that I am still awake.</t6576> <t6577>I have again finished dressing in my red attire, the beads have been poured out, the lipstick has been wiped clean with toilet paper, then hoping nothing is revealed, no smell of it, or his smell remains.</t6577>
<t6578>She arrived at midnight, as announced.</t6578> <t6579>I heard the sound, the cane tapping lightly, feet shuffling softly on the thick carpet lining the hallway, before the faint knocking on the door came.</t6579> <t6580>I didn't say a word, following her back down the hallway to the stairs.</t6580> <t6581>She could move faster, she was stronger than I thought.</t6581> <t6582>Her hand gripped the stair railing, enduring the pain, perhaps, but still holding tight, helping her stand straight.</t6582> <t6583>I thought: she is biting her lip, she is in pain.</t6583> <t6584>She really needs it, this child.</t6584> <t6585>I saw the two of us, one blue shadow, one red shadow, in the reflection of the glasses as we passed by.</t6585> <t6586>Me and my counterpart.</t6586>
<t6587>We passed through the kitchen and went outside.</t6587> <t6588>The kitchen was empty, still lit by a dim night light, peaceful like every empty kitchen at night.</t6588> <t6589>Bowls lay on the rack, iron boxes and porcelain jars formed plump round shapes casting shadows from the light.</t6589> <t6590>Knives were neatly arranged on the wooden shelf.</t6590>
<t6591>“I will not go outside with you,” she whispered.</t6591> <t6592>Strangely, she whispered, as if she were one of us.</t6592> <t6593>The Ladies rarely lower their voices.</t6593> <t6594>“You go out the door and turn right.</t6594> <t6595>There is another door, which is open.</t6595> <t6596>Go up the stairs and knock on the door, he is waiting.</t6596> <t6597>No one will see you.</t6597> <t6598>I will sit here.” So she would wait for me, in case something happened; in case Cora and Rita woke up, who knows why, and came in here from the bedroom behind the kitchen.</t6598> <t6599>What would she say?</t6599> <t6600>Say she couldn't sleep.</t6600> <t6601>Say she wanted to drink hot milk.</t6601> <t6602>She was quick-witted enough for a lie, that I had seen already.</t6602>
<t6603>“The master is in the upstairs bedroom,” she said.</t6603> <t6604>“At this late hour, he won't come down, no way.”</t6604> <t6605>That's what she thought.</t6605>
<t6606>I opened the kitchen door, took a step out, and waited a moment for my eyes to adjust.</t6606> <t6607>It had been a long time since I went outside, alone, at night.</t6607> <t6608>There was already thunder, the storm was getting closer.</t6608> <t6609>What did she do with the Guards?</t6609> <t6610>If not, I could have been shot like a prowler.</t6610> <t6611>She must have bribed them somehow, I hope: cigarettes, whisky, or maybe they knew everything, her pigsty, who knows if it doesn't work out this time, she will use them next time.</t6611>
<t6612>The garage door was just a few steps away.</t6612> <t6613>I rushed over, my feet silently treading on the grass, and quickly opened it, slipping inside. The staircase was dark, so dark that I couldn't see the way.</t6613> <t6614>I groped my way up, step by step: there was carpet, I imagined it to be the color of mushroom caps.</t6614> <t6615>This must have once been a rental room, for students, for young people living alone who had started working.</t6615> <t6616>Many large houses around here have them.</t6616> <t6617>Studio apartments, single rooms, as they are commonly called.</t6617> <t6618>I was quite pleased to remember this.</t6618> <t6619>Private entrance, as stated in the advertisement, meaning a path to satisfy one's instincts, without anyone peeking in.</t6619>
<t6620>I climbed all the stairs and knocked on the door in front of me.</t6620> <t6621>It was him who opened the door, who else could I expect?</t6621> <t6622>A single light was on, just one but enough to make my eyes blink.</t6622> <t6623>I looked away behind him, not wanting to meet his eyes.</t6623> <t6624>The room was a single room, with a folding bed, the bedding already arranged, a small kitchenette somewhere, and another door probably leading to the bathroom.</t6624> <t6625>A bare, military-like, extremely simple room.</t6625> <t6626>No pictures on the walls, no plants on the floor.</t6626> <t6627>He was living in a makeshift manner.</t6627> <t6628>The blanket on the bed was gray, marked with a U.</t6628> <t6629>S.</t6629>
<t6630>He stepped aside to make room for me to pass.</t6630> <t6631>He was only wearing a shirt, holding a lit cigarette.</t6631> <t6632>I smelled the scent of tobacco on him, mingling with the warm air, filling the room.</t6632> <t6633>I wanted to strip off my clothes and bathe in that smoke, letting it seep into my skin.</t6633>
<t6634>Don't start anything; you know why I'm here.</t6634> <t6635>You don't say a word, what are you doing, this is serious.</t6635> <t6636>You move away from me, turn off the light.</t6636> <t6637>Outside, like a beat, a flash of lightning bursts; almost immediately thunder roars.</t6637> <t6638>You are taking off my clothes, a man made of darkness, I can't see your face, I can hardly breathe, can hardly stand, I am no longer standing.</t6638> <t6639>Your mouth presses against me, your hands, I can't wait but you are moving, so fast, the passion, it's been so long, my skin comes alive again, resurrects, arms embracing you, falling and soft water everywhere, bottomless.</t6639> <t6640>I understand it might be just once.</t6640>
<t6641>I made it up.</t6641> <t6642>That's not how it is.</t6642> <t6643>It's like this.</t6643>
<t6644>I climbed all the way up the stairs and knocked on the door.</t6644> <t6645>He himself opened the door.</t6645> <t6646>A light was on, and I blinked my eyes.</t6646> <t6647>I avoided looking at him; this was a single room, the bed was made, bare, and military-like.</t6647> <t6648>There were no pictures, but the blanket had a U mark.</t6648> <t6649>He was only wearing a shirt, holding a cigarette in his hand.</t6649>
<t6650>“Hey,” he told me, “take a puff.” No preamble, he knew why I was there.</t6650> <t6651>To puff out my chest, to bring trouble upon myself, to check my backpack in reverse, those names from a distant past.</t6651> <t6652>I took the cigarette, inhaled deeply, and handed it back.</t6652> <t6653>Our fingers barely touched.</t6653> <t6654>Even a bit of smoke made my head ache.</t6654>
<t6655>He didn't say anything, just looked at me, not smiling.</t6655> <t6656>It would be better, friendlier, if he touched me.</t6656> <t6657>I felt stupid and ugly, even though I knew both of those things were not true.</t6657> <t6658>But then, what is he thinking, why doesn't he say anything?</t6658> <t6659>Maybe he thinks I was just busy whoring around, at Jezebel's, with the Commander or a few other guys.</t6659> <t6660>I was annoyed to find myself worrying about what he thought.</t6660> <t6661>Let's be realistic.</t6661>
<t6662>“I don't have much time,” I said.</t6662> <t6663>An awkward and clumsy sentence, I didn't mean it that way at all.</t6663>
<t6664>"I can squeeze it into a bottle, and you can just pour it in," he said.</t6664> <t6665>Not laughing.</t6665>
<t6666>“There's no need to be so cruel,” I said.</t6666> <t6667>Maybe he felt used.</t6667> <t6668>Maybe he also wanted something from me, like emotions, like acknowledging that he is also human, not just a seed pod.</t6668> <t6669>“I know you have your own difficulties,” I ventured.</t6669>
<t6670>He shrugged.</t6670> <t6671>"I get paid," he said, looking irritable.</t6671> <t6672>But he still didn't move.</t6672>
<t6673>I get paid, she gets beaten, I recite in my head.</t6673> <t6674>So we will do it like that.</t6674> <t6675>He doesn't like makeup, flashy stuff.</t6675> <t6676>We will play it cool.</t6676>
<t6677>“Do you come here often?”</t6677>
<t6678>“What can a good girl like me do in a place like this,” I replied.</t6678> <t6679>Both of them smiled: that's better.</t6679> <t6680>That was an acknowledgment that we were acting, for what else could we do with such a setup?</t6680>
<t6681>"The longer the abstinence, the deeper the love."</t6681> <t6682>We are quoting late-night movies from a very long time ago.</t6682> <t6683>And those movies used even older language: this manner of speaking originates from an era millions of years before us.</t6683> <t6684>Even my mother didn't speak like that when I lived with her.</t6684> <t6685>Perhaps no one has ever spoken like that in real life; it was made up from the start.</t6685> <t6686>Anyway, it's still surprising how quickly it has come back, this old-fashioned, falsely cheerful way of asking for favors.</t6686> <t6687>Now I know what the real meaning is, returning after millions of years: to keep one's core truly distant, truly hidden, untouchable by anyone.</t6687>
<t6688>I'm sad again, talking like this leads to endless sorrow: the music fades, the paper flowers lose their color, the satin frays, echoes within echoes.</t6688> <t6689>Everything is lost, never to return.</t6689> <t6690>Suddenly, I burst into tears.</t6690>
<t6691>Finally, he came forward, wrapped his arms around me, gently rubbed my back, just holding me like that, comforting me.</t6691>
<t6692>“Come on,” he said.</t6692> <t6693>“We don't have much time.”</t6693> <t6694>Still holding my shoulder, he led me to the folding bed and laid me down.</t6694> <t6695>He remembered to pull the blanket back first.</t6695> <t6696>He started unbuttoning, then caressing, kissing my ear. “No playing romantic games,” he said.</t6696> <t6697>“Agreed?”</t6697>
<t6698>That sentence used to have a different implication, in the past.</t6698> <t6699>In the past, it used to mean: unbound.</t6699> <t6700>Now it means: no hero.</t6700> <t6701>It means: don't risk your life for me, if it comes to that.</t6701>
<t6702>And then it was like that.</t6702> <t6703>And just like that.</t6703>
<t6704>I know it might be just once.</t6704> <t6705>Farewell, I thought, right at that moment, farewell.</t6705>
<t6706>But there was no thunder, I added that.</t6706> <t6707>To drown out the sounds that made me ashamed.</t6707>
<t6708>It's not like that anymore either.</t6708> <t6709>I'm not sure what happened, not exactly.</t6709> <t6710>I just hope to reconstruct some part of it: the feeling of love is always just approximate.</t6710>
<t6711>In the middle, I thought about Serena Joy, sitting down there in the kitchen.</t6711> <t6712>Thinking: how cheap.</t6712> <t6713>They would spread their legs for any man.</t6713> <t6714>It only costs a cigarette.</t6714>
<t6715>And I thought again, later: that was betrayal.</t6715> <t6716>Not the event itself, but my reaction.</t6716> <t6717>If I knew for sure he was dead, would it make any difference?</t6717>
<t6718>I wish I were not ashamed.</t6718> <t6719>I wish I did not know shame.</t6719> <t6720>I wish I were ignorant.</t6720> <t6721>That way, I wouldn't have to know how ignorant I am.</t6721>
<t6722>XIV - Redemption</t6722>
<t6723>41</t6723>
<t6724>I wish this story were different.</t6724> <t6725>I wish it were more civilized.</t6725> <t6726>I wish I appeared in it better, if not happy, then at least more energetic, less hesitant, less distracted by trivial matters.</t6726> <t6727>I wish it had a clearer beginning and end.</t6727> <t6728>I wish it were about love, or sudden realizations that mark a lifetime, or even about sunsets, birds, storms, snowfall, anything.</t6728>
<t6729>It could also be about those very things, somehow; but at present, there are too many obstacles, too many whispers, too many assumptions about others, too many unverified rumors, too many unspoken words, too much groping and secrecy.</t6729> <t6730>And again, too much time to endure, time thick as fried food or dense fog, and then suddenly those events, like bombs exploding, amidst the usually courteous streets of sleepwalking ladies.</t6730>
<t6731>Forgive me for this, as it brings so much sorrow. Forgive me, it is fragmented into pieces, like a body trapped between the crossfire of sparrows or being torn apart by five horses.</t6731> <t6732>But there is nothing I can do to fix it.</t6732>
<t6733>I also tried to include a few good things.</t6733> <t6734>Flowers, for example, because what would we be without flowers?</t6734>
<t6735>However, I still feel pain when I have to recount it from the beginning, once more.</t6735> <t6736>Once is enough: wasn't once enough for me, back then?</t6736> <t6737>But I still continue this sad, hungry, wretched story, this limping and crippled tale, because after all, I want someone to hear it, just as I would listen to someone else's story if I ever had the chance, if I met them or if they escaped, in the future, in heaven, in prison, or in the underground, somewhere other than here.</t6737> <t6738>They all share one thing in common: they are not here.</t6738> <t6739>By telling someone anything, at the very least, I believe there is someone, I believe someone exists, I believe someone will come into existence.</t6739> <t6740>Because by telling this story to someone, I affirm their presence.</t6740> <t6741>I tell it, therefore they exist.</t6741>
<t6742>So I decided to continue.</t6742> <t6743>So I decided that I must continue.</t6743> <t6744>I am about to tell the part that people won't like, because in it I behaved really badly, but anyway I will try not to hide anything.</t6744> <t6745>For those who have gone through all that, you deserve everything I have left, not much, but it includes the truth.</t6745>
<t6746>So the story goes like this.</t6746>
<t6747>I turned back to Nick.</t6747> <t6748>Time and again, by myself,</t6748>
<t6749>Scrcna doesn't know.</t6749> <t6750>It's not because of orders, there's no reason.</t6750> <t6751>It's not because of him, entirely just for myself.</t6751> <t6752>I don't even consider it dedicating myself to him, because what do I have left to give?</t6752> <t6753>I don't feel like I'm giving, but rather grateful, every time he lets me in.</t6753> <t6754>He isn't obligated to anything.</t6754>
<t6755>To do that, I became reckless, I jumped at every foolish opportunity.</t6755> <t6756>At the Commander's place, I went upstairs as usual, but then went all the way down the hallway to the back stairs for the Marthas, then through the kitchen.</t6756> <t6757>Each time, I would hear the kitchen door click shut behind me and almost turn back, the cold metallic sound, like a mouse trap or a weapon, but I didn't turn back.</t6757> <t6758>I would rush a few steps across the brightly lit lawn - the floodlights were back, watching out for bullets hitting me at any moment before even hearing the shot.</t6758> <t6759>I would find my way up the dark stairs and lean against the door, breathing, blood pounding in my ears.</t6759> <t6760>There's no stimulant like fear.</t6760> <t6761>Then I would knock very lightly, like a beggar.</t6761> <t6762>Every time, I would be wary that he wasn't there, or worse, that he would tell me not to come in.</t6762> <t6763>He might say he didn't want to break the rules any more, stick his neck out any more, for me.</t6763> <t6764>Or worse, say he wasn't interested in me anymore.</t6764> <t6765>The fact that he couldn't do any of those things to me was as much kindness as it was unbelievable luck.</t6765>
<t6766>I told you it was really bad.</t6766>
<t6767>The specific story is as follows.</t6767>
<t6768>He opened the door.</t6768> <t6769>Sleeves rolled up, shirt untucked, hanging loosely; holding a brush, a cigarette, or a cup containing something.</t6769> <t6770>He also had his own stash up there, black market goods, I guessed.</t6770> <t6771>His hands always held something, as if he was going about his usual routine, not waiting for me, not anticipating.</t6771> <t6772>Perhaps he wasn't waiting, not anticipating.</t6772> <t6773>Maybe he had no concept of the future, or didn't bother or dare to imagine it.</t6773>
<t6774>"Is it too late?"</t6774>
<t6775>He shook his head no.</t6775> <t6776>Now we implicitly understand that it is never too late, but I still politely ask as a formality.</t6776> <t6777>Thanks to that, I feel like I am in control of the situation, having the right to choose, the right to decide this way or that.</t6777> <t6778>He stepped aside, I walked through, and he closed the door.</t6778> <t6779>Then he went to the other end of the room to close the window.</t6779> <t6780>After that, he turned off the light.</t6780> <t6781>There was no more back and forth between us, at this stage.</t6781> <t6782>I had managed to undress halfway.</t6782> <t6783>Talking would be saved for later.</t6783>
<t6784>By the Commander, I close my eyes, even when saying goodbye.</t6784> <t6785>I don't want to look at him too closely.</t6785> <t6786>But now, here, every time, my eyes are wide open.</t6786> <t6787>If only there were a light source, like a candle, placed in a bottle neck, reminiscent of college days, but that would be too risky; I have to make do with the headlights, shining up from the yard, piercing through the white curtains similar to those in my room.</t6787> <t6788>I want to see as much as possible, in you, perceive you, memorize you, keep you as an image to savor later: the contours of your body, the smoothness of your flesh, the glistening sweat on your hair, the long, mocking, inscrutable face.</t6788> <t6789>I should have done that with Luke before, paid more attention, to every detail, moles and scars, to every wrinkle; I didn't know and you faded away.</t6789> <t6790>Day by day, night by night you withdrew, and I became more distrustful.</t6790>
<t6791>For this person, I would wear pink feathers, purple star beads, if you asked; anything, even a rabbit's tail.</t6791> <t6792>But he doesn't care for such frills.</t6792> <t6793>We make love each time as if there were no doubt that there would never be another time, for him or me, with anyone else, forever.</t6793> <t6794>And when the next time comes, it is always a surprise, an extra gift, a present.</t6794>
<t6795>Here with you is a safe haven, a dark cave, for us to curl up together while the storm rages outside.</t6795> <t6796>This is self-deception, of course.</t6796> <t6797>This room is the most dangerous place in the world for me.</t6797> <t6798>If caught, don't expect any mercy, but now I don't care.</t6798> <t6799>But how did I come to trust you so much, even that is foolish?</t6799> <t6800>How could I think I understand you, understand anything about you or your true actions?</t6800>
<t6801>I chase away those restless whispers.</t6801> <t6802>I talk too much.</t6802> <t6803>I tell everything that shouldn't be told.</t6803> <t6804>I talk about Moira, about Ofglen; though I don't mention Luke.</t6804> <t6805>I want to talk about the woman in the room too, my predecessor, but I don't.</t6805> <t6806>I am jealous of her.</t6806> <t6807>If she also preceded me here, on this bed, I don't want to know about it.</t6807>
<t6808>I even revealed my real name, feeling that I was known because of it.</t6808> <t6809>I acted like a fool.</t6809> <t6810>I should have been wiser.</t6810> <t6811>I turned him into a god statue, into a shadow cutout.</t6811>
<t6812>On the contrary, he spoke very little: no more beating around the bush or joking.</t6812> <t6813>He hardly asked anything.</t6813> <t6814>He seemed indifferent to most of what I said, only becoming animated at the potential of my body, although he did observe when I spoke.</t6814> <t6815>He observed my facial expressions.</t6815>
<t6816>It is unimaginable that someone I know so well could betray me.</t6816>
<t6817>Neither of them mentioned the word love, not even once.</t6817> <t6818>It would be tempting fate; it would be playing a romantic game, courting bad luck.</t6818>
<t6819>Today there are different flowers, drier, sharper, summer's peak flowers: white daisies, coneflowers - the black-eyed Susans, marking the beginning of the long slope down to autumn.</t6819> <t6820>I see through the gardens, while walking beside Ofglen, going and coming back.</t6820> <t6821>I almost don't hear her, I don't trust her anymore.</t6821> <t6822>Her whispered words seem unreal.</t6822> <t6823>What use are they, to me, now?</t6823>
<t6824>She can enter his room at night, she said.</t6824> <t6825>Search the desk thoroughly.</t6825> <t6826>There must be documents, records.</t6826>
<t6827>The door is locked, I muttered.</t6827>
<t6828>We found the key, she said.</t6828> <t6829>Don't you want to know who he is, what he does?</t6829>
<t6830>But the Commander-in-Chief no longer holds my primary interest.</t6830> <t6831>I struggled to avoid revealing that I was no longer interested in him.</t6831>
<t6832>Just act the same as before, in everything, Nick said.</t6832> <t6833>Don't change anything at all.</t6833> <t6834>Otherwise, they will know.</t6834> <t6835>He kissed me, looking at me the whole time.</t6835> <t6836>Promise? No slip-ups.</t6836>
<t6837>I placed his hand on my belly.</t6837> <t6838>It's there, I said.</t6838> <t6839>I can feel it.</t6839> <t6840>In a few more weeks, it will be certain.</t6840>
<t6841>This I know is just trying to believe in what I hope for.</t6841>
<t6842>He will love her to death, he said.</t6842> <t6843>She will too.</t6843>
<t6844>But it is your child, I said.</t6844> <t6845>It will be your child, really.</t6845> <t6846>I want that.</t6846>
<t6847>However, we do not discuss further.</t6847>
<t6848>I give up, I tell Ofglen.</t6848> <t6849>I'm very scared. Anyway, I'm not good at this, I'll get caught.</t6849>
<t6850>I don't even bother to put on a suit of regret anymore, I've become too lazy.</t6850>
<t6851>We will rescue you, she said.</t6851> <t6852>We can rescue if we must, if someone is in danger.</t6852> <t6853>That urgent danger.</t6853>
<t6854>The fact is that I no longer want to leave, escape, or cross the border to freedom.</t6854> <t6855>I want to stay here, with Nick, in the place where he is still by my side.</t6855>
<t6856>Talking about this, I feel ashamed.</t6856> <t6857>But that's not all.</t6857> <t6858>Up until now, I still realize that admitting it is also a form of bragging.</t6858> <t6859>It is also a form of pride, as it shows how serious that connection is and how justified it is to me.</t6859> <t6860>How much it is worth exchanging for.</t6860> <t6861>Just like when people talk about a near-death illness they recovered from; or about a battle.</t6861> <t6862>Affirming the gravity of the situation.</t6862>
<t6863>Considered as important as that, a man, I had never imagined before, would exist.</t6863>
<t6864>There are days when I am more rational.</t6864> <t6865>I do not describe myself in terms of love.</t6865> <t6866>I say, I have created a life for myself here, almost like this.</t6866> <t6867>Surely this thought must have come to the wives of pioneers, and women escaping from war, if they found a man.</t6867> <t6868>Humanity is incredibly adaptable, my mother would surely say.</t6868> <t6869>How astonishing it is to see what people can get used to, as long as there is some compensation.</t6869>
<t6870>It won't be long now, Cora said, on the day of the monthly sanitary pad distribution.</t6870> <t6871>Not long now, she smiled at me shyly but knowingly.</t6871> <t6872>Do you know?</t6872> <t6873>Do you and Rita know what I do, sneaking up their stairs every night?</t6873> <t6874>Have I exposed myself, when daydreaming, when smiling aimlessly, when lightly touching my lips thinking they wouldn't see?</t6874>
<t6875>Ofglen has let me go.</t6875> <t6876>She whispers less, talks more about the weather.</t6876> <t6877>I don't feel regret.</t6877> <t6878>I feel light.</t6878>
<t6879>42</t6879>
<t6880>The bell tolled; from afar we could also hear it.</t6880> <t6881>It was morning, and we hadn't been given breakfast this morning.</t6881> <t6882>At the main gate, we lined up in pairs to pass through.</t6882> <t6883>A whole crowded guard squad, the Special Angel unit, in riot gear - protective helmets, black acrylic face shields that made them look like beetles, long batons, air guns - stood blocking the outer perimeter of the Wall.</t6883> <t6884>The room went mad.</t6884> <t6885>The hooks on the Wall were all empty.</t6885>
<t6886>Today's redemption is at the district level, only women attend.</t6886> <t6887>Redemption always has boundaries.</t6887> <t6888>It was just announced yesterday.</t6888> <t6889>They only announce one day in advance.</t6889> <t6890>Not enough time to get used to it.</t6890>
<t6891>Following the sound of the bell, we walked along the path marked by the footprints of students, past the buildings that once were lecture halls and dormitories.</t6891> <t6892>Being here again feels truly strange.</t6892> <t6893>From the outside, you can't tell anything has changed, except that almost all the windows have their blinds drawn.</t6893> <t6894>Those buildings now belong to the Eye.</t6894>
<t6895>We followed in line onto the wide lawn in front of the building that used to be a library.</t6895> <t6896>The white steps leading up were still intact, the main door unchanged.</t6896> <t6897>A wooden stage had sprung up on the grass, just as it did every spring, for the graduation ceremonies of the past.</t6897> <t6898>I remembered the hats, the light-colored hats on the heads of some mothers, the black gowns for the students to wear, and the red ones too.</t6898> <t6899>But this stage, in the end, was not the same as before, because of the addition of three wooden columns with loops of rope.</t6899>
<t6900>In front of the stage is a microphone, with the television camera modestly set aside.</t6900>
<t6901>I've only attended this event once, two years ago.</t6901> <t6902>Redeeming women is not seen very often.</t6902> <t6903>It's needed less now.</t6903> <t6904>These days, we are so well-behaved.</t6904>
<t6905>I don't want to tell this story.</t6905>
<t6906>We took our places in the usual order: The Lady and her daughter, folding wooden chairs at the back, The Frugal Wife and Martha around the edge of the grass and on the steps, and The Maidservant in the front row, for all to see.</t6906> <t6907>We had no seats, had to kneel, and this time there were cushions, tiny ones made of red velvet, with nothing written on them, not even Faith.</t6907>
<t6908>Maybe the weather is quite nice: not too hot, cloudy but bright.</t6908> <t6909>Kneeling here in the rain would be miserable.</t6909> <t6910>Perhaps that's why they announced it so late: to be sure about the weather.</t6910> <t6911>It's as reasonable as any other reason.</t6911>
<t6912>I knelt on my red velvet knees.</t6912> <t6913>I thought about tonight, about love, in the shadows, in the reflections on the white lime walls.</t6913> <t6914>I remembered the embrace.</t6914>
<t6915>A rope twisted like a snake in front of the top row of seats, running along the second row, winding back through the rows of seats, meandering like a river, very ancient, very slow, seen from the plane above, all the way to the end.</t6915> <t6916>The thick brown rope emitted a strong tar odor.</t6916> <t6917>The other end extended all the way to the stage.</t6917> <t6918>Like a slow-burning fuse, or a mooring line for a hot air balloon.</t6918>
<t6919>On the platform, to the left, those who are redeemed today: two Maidservants, one Lady.</t6919> <t6920>Having a Lady is unusual, and I couldn't stop myself from looking up in curiosity.</t6920> <t6921>I really wanted to know what she had done.</t6921>
<t6922>They had been here before the gate opened.</t6922> <t6923>All three sat on folding chairs, like graduates waiting to receive their awards.</t6923> <t6924>Hands resting in their laps, looking as if they were clasped in serenity.</t6924> <t6925>Slightly swaying, probably injected or given medication, to prevent causing a disturbance.</t6925> <t6926>Everything is better if it remains calm.</t6926> <t6927>Were they tied to the chairs?</t6927> <t6928>Can't tell, with all those flowing dresses.</t6928>
<t6929>At this moment, the delegation of officials is ascending the stage, climbing each step on the right: three women, one Aunt leading, two black-clad Redeemers following a step behind.</t6929> <t6930>Next are the remaining Aunts.</t6930> <t6931>The murmuring among us ceases completely.</t6931> <t6932>The trio lines up, facing us, the Aunt flanked by the two dark figures.</t6932>
<t6933>It's Aunt Lydia.</t6933> <t6934>How many years has it been since I last saw her?</t6934> <t6935>I had started to think she only existed in my mind, but here she is, looking a bit older.</t6935> <t6936>From here, I can see very clearly; I notice the lines forming on either side of her nose, the frown etched into her face.</t6936> <t6937>Her eyes blink, she smiles nervously, glancing left and right, gauging the audience, then raises her hand to touch the scarf on her head.</t6937> <t6938>A very strange, muffled sound escapes through the amplification system: she just cleared her throat.</t6938>
<t6939>My whole body was trembling.</t6939> <t6940>Hatred filled my mouth like saliva.</t6940>
<t6941>The sun emerged, the stage and the crowd on it lit up like a Christmas scene.</t6941> <t6942>I saw the wrinkles under Aunt Lydia's eyes, the pale complexion of the three people on the chair, the strands of rope in front of me on the grass, I saw each blade of grass.</t6942> <t6943>There was a dandelion, right in front of me, yolk-yellow in color.</t6943> <t6944>I felt hungry.</t6944> <t6945>The bell rang.</t6945>
<t6946>Aunt Lydia stood up straight, smoothed her skirt with both hands, and stepped up to the microphone.</t6946> <t6947>“Good afternoon, ladies,” she said, and immediately the sound system responded with an ear-piercing screech.</t6947> <t6948>Among us, unable to hold it in, laughter erupted.</t6948> <t6949>It was hard to suppress, given the tension and Aunt Lydia's furious expression as she adjusted the sound.</t6949> <t6950>This was supposed to be a solemn moment.</t6950>
<t6951>“Good afternoon, ladies,” she repeated, her voice now sharp and grating.</t6951> <t6952>Ladies, instead of the girl, because of the Ladies.</t6952> <t6953>“I am sure we are all well aware of the unfortunate circumstances that have brought us together on this beautiful morning, at a time when I am certain we would all rather be doing something else, at least I speak for myself, but duty is a harsh taskmaster, or perhaps I should say in this case a harsh taskmistress, and it is in the name of duty that we are all here today.”</t6953>
<t6954>It continued like that for minutes, but I didn't listen.</t6954> <t6955>I had heard this play, or similar ones, too many times already: the same clichés, the same slogans, the same words: the torch lighting the future, the cradle of the race, the duty before us.</t6955> <t6956>It's hard to believe that after this speech there wouldn't be polite applause, and tea with biscuits served on the grass.</t6956>
<t6957>This is just the prelude, I thought.</t6957> <t6958>Now she will get to the point.</t6958>
<t6959>Aunt Lydia rummaged through her bag and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper.</t6959> <t6960>It took her an absurdly long time to open it and skim through.</t6960> <t6961>The piece of paper was shoved under our noses, making us understand exactly who she was, forcing us to look while she silently read, flaunting her privilege.</t6961> <t6962>Crude, I thought.</t6962> <t6963>Let's get this over with.</t6963>
<t6964>“In previous occasions,” Aunt Lydia continued, “it was customary before the main Redemption ceremony to detail the charges against these prisoners.</t6964> <t6965>However, we have concluded that such public announcements, especially when broadcasted, would inevitably lead to a series of, if I may say so, more like an outbreak, of imitative sins. Therefore, we have decided in the interest of all to put an end to this practice.</t6965> <t6966>The Redemption ceremony will proceed without any further embellishments.”</t6966>
<t6967>The collective murmuring rose again.</t6967> <t6968>We considered the sins of others as a secret common language.</t6968> <t6969>Through that, we showed ourselves what we could still do, at least.</t6969> <t6970>This announcement was not received well.</t6970> <t6971>But no one could tell just by looking at Aunt Lydia, smiling and blinking as if she were basking in applause.</t6971> <t6972>Now we were left to our own schemes and guesses.</t6972> <t6973>The first person, they were pulling her up from her chair, gloved hands grabbing her: Reading?</t6973> <t6974>No, that would only cut off a hand, for a third offense.</t6974> <t6975>Adultery, or an attempt to kill her Commander?</t6975> <t6976>Or the Commander's Wife, more likely.</t6976> <t6977>At least that's what we thought. As for that Wife, she almost only had one task to bring them to Redemption.</t6977> <t6978>They could treat us in almost any way, but they were not allowed to kill us.</t6978> <t6979>Not according to the law.</t6979> <t6980>Especially not with knitting needles or garden shears, or knives stolen from the kitchen, and especially not when we were pregnant.</t6980> <t6981>It could be adultery, of course.</t6981> <t6982>There was always that possibility.</t6982>
<t6983>Or plotting to escape.</t6983>
<t6984>"Ofcharles," Lydia said.</t6984> <t6985>Among the familiar faces.</t6985> <t6986>The woman was brought out, she walked as if only focusing on stepping correctly, one foot after the other, a hundred percent drugged.</t6986> <t6987>The corner of her mouth twisted into a dazed smile.</t6987> <t6988>One side of her face twitched, blinking involuntarily, directly at the camera.</t6988> <t6989>They won't show this scene, of course, this isn't broadcast live.</t6989> <t6990>Two Redeemers tied her hands behind her back.</t6990>
<t6991>There is the sound of retching behind me.</t6991>
<t6992>Not having breakfast is because of that.</t6992>
<t6993>"Janine, who else could it be," Ofglen whispered.</t6993>
<t6994>I had seen beforehand, a white bag pulled over the head, the body lifted onto a high chair as if onto a bus step, held steady, the noose skillfully adjusted around the neck, like a sacrificial robe, the stone boat kicked away.</t6994> <t6995>I had heard the sound of sighs rising up from all sides, like air escaping from an air mattress, I had seen Aunt Lydia place her hand over the microphone, hiding the sounds coming from behind her, I had once leaned forward to touch the rope in front of me, along with everyone else, with both hands, the rope full of fur, sticky with tar in the hot sun, had placed my hand on my left chest to show my unity with the Redeemer and my consent, and the complicity in this person's death.</t6995> <t6996>I had seen the legs kicking, the two men in black grabbing and holding down with all their might.</t6996> <t6997>I did not want to look again.</t6997> <t6998>I looked at the grass.</t6998> <t6999>I described the rope.</t6999>
<t7000>43</t7000>
<t7001>Those three bodies hanging there, even though their heads were covered with bags, still looked strangely tense, like plucked chickens with their necks tied up in a butcher's shop, like birds with clipped wings, like birds that cannot fly, fallen angels.</t7001> <t7002>It was impossible to take my eyes off them.</t7002> <t7003>Under the hems of their skirts, their feet dangled, two pairs of red shoes, one pair blue.</t7003> <t7004>Remove the rope and the bags, and this could be a dance, a ballet, a snapshot caught mid-fall.</t7004> <t7005>It looked very orderly.</t7005> <t7006>It looked very showbiz.</t7006> <t7007>Aunt Lydia must have placed the blue in the middle.</t7007>
<t7008>“Today's Redemption Ceremony is now over,” Aunt Lydia announced with the microphone.</t7008> <t7009>“But...”</t7009>
<t7010>We turned to look at Aunt, listened to Aunt, admired Aunt.</t7010> <t7011>Aunt always knew how to time the moments of silence.</t7011> <t7012>A tremor passed through us, unsettling.</t7012> <t7013>Something else, surely, was about to happen.</t7013>
<t7014>"You girls can stand up and form a circle." Aunt smiled at us, generously, magnanimously.</t7014> <t7015>Aunt has something to give us.</t7015> <t7016>Distribute.</t7016> <t7017>"Order, now."</t7017>
<t7018>Auntie is talking to us, the group of maidservants.</t7018> <t7019>Some of the ladies have left, along with a few daughters.</t7019> <t7020>Most of them stayed, but far behind, on the sidelines, just watching.</t7020> <t7021>They are not in the circle.</t7021>
<t7022>Two Guards have come out, now rolling up the thick rope, storing it away.</t7022> <t7023>A few people are gathering the pile of cushions.</t7023> <t7024>We are bustling about, moving on the grass in front of the stage, some people jostling to get to the front row, right in the center, while others are pushing just as aggressively to get to the middle, shielded on all sides.</t7024> <t7025>Being too conspicuous in such groups is a mistake; you will be lumped in with the lukewarm, lacking fervent devotion.</t7025> <t7026>The heat is accumulating here, a murmur, a trembling on the verge of erupting into anger.</t7026> <t7027>Bodies tense, eyes blazing, as if on the prowl.</t7027>
<t7028>I don't want to go to the front, nor to the back.</t7028> <t7029>I'm not sure what's coming, though I understand it's not something I want to see up close.</t7029> <t7030>But Ofglen is holding my hand, she pulls me along with her, and now we're up to the second row, with only a small crowd in front of us.</t7030> <t7031>I don't want to look, but I don't pull back either.</t7031> <t7032>I've heard many rumors, though I only believe half of them.</t7032> <t7033>Despite everything I've seen, I still tell myself: they wouldn't go that far.</t7033>
<t7034>“You know the Pre-Trial rules,” Aunt Lydia said.</t7034> <t7035>“You wait until I blow the whistle.</t7035> <t7036>After that, you can do whatever you want until I blow it a second time.</t7036> <t7037>Understand?”</t7037>
<t7038>There was a sound from us in response, a wordless assent.</t7038>
<t7039>“Here we go,” Aunt Lydia said.</t7039> <t7040>She nodded. Two Guardians, not the ones who had just put away the rope, came forward from behind the stage.</t7040> <t7041>They half carried, half dragged a person between them.</t7041> <t7042>This person was also wearing a Guardian’s uniform, but had lost his hat, and his clothes were torn and dirty.</t7042> <t7043>His face was full of cuts and bruises, the deep bruises had turned a reddish-brown; his flesh was swollen in lumps, and his unshaven beard was scraggly.</t7043> <t7044>It didn’t look like a face but rather some strange vegetable, a scarred root or tuber, damaged while it was growing.</t7044> <t7045>Even from here I could smell him: the stench of feces and vomit.</t7045> <t7046>His blond hair hung over his face, matted with something.</t7046> <t7047>Dried sweat?</t7047>
<t7048>I looked at him with utter disgust.</t7048> <t7049>He looked like a drunk.</t7049> <t7050>He looked like a drunk who had just been in a fight.</t7050> <t7051>What was the point of bringing a drunk here?</t7051>
<t7052>“This man,” Aunt Lydia said, “has been convicted of rape.”</t7052> <t7053>Her voice trembled with rage, and also with a sense of triumph.</t7053> <t7054>“He was once a Guardian.</t7054> <t7055>He has sullied his uniform.</t7055> <t7056>He has violated a position of trust.</t7056> <t7057>His accomplice in this heinous crime has been shot.</t7057> <t7058>The punishment for rape, as you all know, is death.</t7058> <t7059>Deuteronomy chapter 22, verses 23 to 29.</t7059> <t7060>I should add that this crime involved two of you and involved the use of a weapon.</t7060> <t7061>Thus, it was even more brutal.</t7061> <t7062>I will not go into further details to sully your ears, except to inform you that one of the two is pregnant and the child has died.”</t7062>
<t7063>The sighs of us prisoners rose up; unconsciously, I clenched my fist.</t7063> <t7064>This is truly outrageous, this act of coercion.</t7064> <t7065>A child too, after everything we had to go through.</t7065> <t7066>Indeed, the bloodlust surged; I wanted to tear apart, smash, and shred to pieces.</t7066>
<t7067>We jostled each other, pushing forward, our heads turning from side to side, nostrils flaring, smelling the scent of death, we looked at each other's faces, seeing the anger.</t7067> <t7068>Shooting is still humane.</t7068> <t7069>The man's head sluggishly turned around: could he hear what we were saying?</t7069>
<t7070>Aunt Lydia waited for a moment, then gave a small smile and brought the whistle to her lips.</t7070> <t7071>We all heard it, shrill as silver, echoing back from a volleyball game of years gone by.</t7071>
<t7072>The two guards released the man and stepped back.</t7072> <t7073>He staggered - drugged, perhaps? - then collapsed.</t7073> <t7074>His eyes squinted within the swollen flesh on his face, as if blinded.</t7074> <t7075>He had been imprisoned in darkness.</t7075> <t7076>He raised a hand to his cheek, as if to check if he was still there.</t7076> <t7077>Everything happened in a flash, but felt like an eternity.</t7077>
<t7078>No one stepped forward.</t7078> <t7079>The women looked at him in horror, like a half-dead sewer rat dragging itself across the kitchen floor.</t7079> <t7080>He squinted his eyes, looking around at the red circle of women.</t7080> <t7081>One corner of his mouth lifted, in disbelief - a smile</t7081><t7082>?</t7082>
<t7083>My aunt looked back, behind the shattered face, he looked really miserable.</t7083> <t7084>He was approximately thirty years old.</t7084> <t7085>Not Luke.</t7085>
<t7086>But it could have been Luke, I know.</t7086> <t7087>It could have been Nick.</t7087> <t7088>I understand that I cannot touch him no matter what he has done.</t7088>
<t7089>He said something.</t7089> <t7090>The words came out thick, as if his throat was crushed, his tongue swollen in his mouth, but I still understood.</t7090> <t7091>He said, "I don't..</t7091><t7092>"</t7092>
<t7093>The crowd surged forward, like a throng at an old-time rock concert, when the doors opened, the urgent wave swept over us like a tide.</t7093> <t7094>The air boiled with blood, we were allowed to do anything and this was freedom, in my whole body, I was spinning like a whirlwind, red surged all around, but before the tide of fabric and flesh could hit him, that Ofglen had already elbowed her way through the crowd in front, thrusting her elbows up, left, right, charging straight at him.</t7094> <t7095>She shoved him down, toppling him over, then savagely kicked his head, once, twice, three times, each kick strong, painful, and precise.</t7095> <t7096>The sounds rose, choking sounds, a low murmur like a moan, a howl, and the red mass collapsed forward so I could no longer see, he disappeared under the arms, fists, and feet.</t7096> <t7097>A high-pitched scream from somewhere, like a frightened horse.</t7097>
<t7098>I stayed behind, trying to stand firm.</t7098> <t7099>Something hit my back, and I staggered.</t7099> <t7100>When I regained my balance and looked around, I saw the Ladies and daughters leaning forward on their seats, and the aunts on the platform looking down with delight.</t7100> <t7101>From up there, everything was clearer.</t7101>
<t7102>He has become that.</t7102>
<t7103>Ofglen has returned to my side.</t7103> <t7104>Her face is closed, emotionless.</t7104>
<t7105>“I saw everything,” I told her.</t7105> <t7106>Now the feelings are coming back: dizziness, frustration, nausea.</t7106> <t7107>Barbaric. “Why did you do that? You! I thought...</t7107><t7108>”</t7108>
<t7109>“Don't look at me,” she said.</t7109> <t7110>“They are looking.”</t7110>
<t7111>"I don't care," I said.</t7111> <t7112>My voice rose, I couldn't help it.</t7112>
<t7113>“Get a grip,” she said.</t7113> <t7114>She pretended to brush me off, first my hands then my shoulders, leaning close to my ear. “Don't do anything foolish.</t7114> <t7115>He is not a rapist, he is involved in politics.</t7115> <t7116>He is a comrade.</t7116> <t7117>I will knock you out.</t7117> <t7118>Free you from this torment.</t7118> <t7119>Don't you see what they are doing to him?”</t7119>
<t7120>Comrades, I think.</t7120> <t7121>A Guard.</t7121> <t7122>It seems like something from the sky.</t7122>
<t7123>Aunt Lydia blew the whistle again, but they did not stop immediately.</t7123> <t7124>Two Guardians intervened, pulling them away from what was left.</t7124> <t7125>Some lay on the grass from the moment they were accidentally hit or kicked.</t7125> <t7126>Some had fainted.</t7126> <t7127>They staggered away, in groups of two or three or alone.</t7127> <t7128>All seemed dazed.</t7128>
<t7129>“You will find your partners and straighten up into pairs,” Aunt Lydia said into the microphone.</t7129> <t7130>Hardly anyone paid attention.</t7130> <t7131>Someone walked towards me, stepping as if feeling their way in the dark: Janine.</t7131> <t7132>A bloodstain on her cheek, more blood on the white cloth.</t7132> <t7133>She was smiling, a bright and fresh smile.</t7133> <t7134>Her eyes were vacant.</t7134>
<t7135>"Hello," she said.</t7135> <t7136>"How are you all?" She was holding something very tightly in her right hand.</t7136> <t7137>A tuft of blonde hair.</t7137> <t7138>She giggled.</t7138>
<t7139>"Janine," I said.</t7139> <t7140>But she had given up, completely, she was in free fall, she had retreated.</t7140>
<t7141>“Have a nice day,” she said, and left us, heading towards the gate.</t7141>
<t7142>I watched her.</t7142> <t7143>Escaping was too easy, I thought so.</t7143> <t7144>I didn't even feel pity, though I should have.</t7144> <t7145>I was angry.</t7145> <t7146>I'm not proud of this, or anything today.</t7146> <t7147>Oh but, that's the main thing.</t7147>
<t7148>My hand smells of tar.</t7148> <t7149>I want to go back to that house, straight to the bathroom to scrub and rub, using pumice stone and coarse soap, to completely remove this smell from my skin.</t7149> <t7150>The smell makes me want to vomit.</t7150>
<t7151>But I am still hungry.</t7151> <t7152>It's disgusting, but it's the truth.</t7152> <t7153>Death makes me hungry.</t7153> <t7154>Maybe because I have been drained, or maybe in this way my body confirms that it is still alive, continuing to repeat the cradle prayer: I live, I live.</t7154> <t7155>I am, still, alive.</t7155>
<t7156>I want to go to bed, make love, immediately.</t7156>
<t7157>I think of the word delicious.</t7157>
<t7158>I can swallow an entire elephant.</t7158>
<t7159>44</t7159>
<t7160>Everything has returned to normal.</t7160>
<t7161>How can this be called normal?</t7161> <t7162>But compared to this morning, this is very normal.</t7162>
<t7163>Lunch consists of a cheese sandwich, made with brown bread, a cup of milk, chopped celery, and canned pears.</t7163> <t7164>Lunch is a packed meal at school.</t7164> <t7165>I eat everything, not in a hurry, but savoring each item, the flavors rising on my tongue.</t7165> <t7166>Now it's time to go shopping, as usual.</t7166> <t7167>I'm actually looking forward to it.</t7167> <t7168>Daily routines are somewhat comforting.</t7168>
<t7169>I went out the back door, following the path for cars.</t7169> <t7170>Nick was washing the car, his hat tilted to one side.</t7170> <t7171>He did not look at me.</t7171> <t7172>We avoid looking at each other these days.</t7172> <t7173>If not, it would surely reveal something, even in the middle of an empty space, with no one looking.</t7173>
<t7174>I arrive at the corner of the street to wait for Ofglen.</t7174> <t7175>Today she is late.</t7175> <t7176>Finally, I see her, a figure in red and white cloth, like a kite, walking steadily as we have all been taught.</t7176> <t7177>I look at her, at first noticing nothing.</t7177> <t7178>Then, as she gets closer, I think something seems off about her.</t7178> <t7179>Her shape is off.</t7179> <t7180>She has changed, in a way that can't be named; she is not injured, not limping.</t7180> <t7181>It looks like she has shrunk.</t7181>
<t7182>Then, as I got closer, I understood what it was.</t7182> <t7183>She was not Ofglcn.</t7183> <t7184>She was just as tall, but thinner, and her face was more yellow, not rosy.</t7184> <t7185>She came to me and stopped.</t7185>
<t7186>“Bless the fruits,” she said.</t7186> <t7187>Stern and upright.</t7187>
<t7188>“Pray for the Blessed One to grant birth,” I replied.</t7188> <t7189>My aunt did not show any surprise.</t7189>
<t7190>“You must be Offred,” she said.</t7190> <t7191>I said yes, and we started walking.</t7191>
<t7192>What now, I thought.</t7192> <t7193>My head was spinning, not a good sign, how was she, how to know dipc085 without appearing overly concerned?</t7193> <t7194>People did not expect us to form bonds of friendship, loyalty.</t7194> <t7195>I tried to remember how much longer Ofglen had in her current term.</t7195>
<t7196>“We have been blessed with beautiful weather,” I said.</t7196>
<t7197>“I am immensely grateful.” The voice was calm, steady, and restrained.</t7197>
<t7198>We passed the first checkpoint without saying anything more.</t7198> <t7199>She was sparing with her words, but so was I.</t7199> <t7200>Was she waiting for me to start, to reveal myself, or was she a devotee, immersed in prayer?</t7200>
<t7201>"Has Ofglen moved away already, so soon?" I asked.</t7201> <t7202>But I knew it wasn't true.</t7202> <t7203>I just saw her this morning.</t7203> <t7204>If there was, she would have said.</t7204>
<t7205>“I am Ofglen,” the other said.</t7205> <t7206>Perfectly word for word.</t7206> <t7207>And of course, that is her name, while Ofglen, wherever she is, is no longer Olglen.</t7207> <t7208>I never knew her real name.</t7208>
<t7209>One can disappear like that, amidst a sea of names.</t7209> <t7210>It's no longer easy to find her.</t7210>
<t7211>We went to Milk and Honey, then to Flesh and Bone, I bought chicken and the new Ofglen got ground beef, one and a half pounds, still the same long lines as always.</t7211> <t7212>I met a few acquaintances, exchanged minimal nods to signal to each other that we are still known, at least to one or two people, that we still exist.</t7212> <t7213>Coming out of Flesh and Bone, I said to the new Ofglen, “We should go by the Wall.”</t7213> <t7214>I don't know why I said that; perhaps as a way to test her reaction.</t7214> <t7215>I needed to know if she was one of us.</t7215> <t7216>If she was, if I could confirm it, maybe she could tell me what really happened to Ofglen.</t7216>
<t7217>“Up to you,” she said.</t7217> <t7218>Was that indifference, or caution?</t7218>
<t7219>On the Wall of Shame this morning, the three women were still in the same clothes, still the same shoes, still with white bags over their heads.</t7219> <t7220>Their hands had been untied, hanging stiffly and properly by their sides.</t7220> <t7221>The middle one was blue, the ones on either side were red, though no longer bright; it seemed they had faded, dulled, like dead butterflies, or tropical fish dried up on land.</t7221> <t7222>Their glossy sheen was gone.</t7222> <t7223>We stood silently watching.</t7223>
<t7224>"Let's look at that and remember," finally said Ofglen.</t7224>
<t7225>At first, I did not respond, as I had not yet figured out what she meant.</t7225> <t7226>It could mean to remember the injustice and cruelty of this regime.</t7226> <t7227>If so, I should say yes.</t7227> <t7228>Or it could be the opposite, she might be saying that we need to remember to comply with the commandments and avoid trouble, otherwise we will be duly punished.</t7228> <t7229>If that is her intention, I should say amen.</t7229> <t7230>Her voice was smooth, without tone, without clues.</t7230>
<t7231>I took a risk. "Yes," I said.</t7231>
<t7232>There was no reply, though I noticed a flicker of white in the corner of my eye, as if she had glanced quickly over.</t7232>
<t7233>A moment later, we turned back and began the long journey home, matching our steps in unison to show uniformity.</t7233>
<t7234>I think maybe we should wait before going any further.</t7234> <t7235>It's still not the time to question or investigate.</t7235> <t7236>I need to spend a week, two weeks, maybe longer, observing her carefully, listening to her tone, her careless words, like Ofglen listened to me before.</t7236> <t7237>Now that Ofglen is gone, I am cautious again, the lethargy has vanished, my body no longer serves for pleasure but senses danger within it.</t7237> <t7238>I must not be hasty, must not take risks unless necessary.</t7238> <t7239>But I have to know.</t7239> <t7240>I restrained myself through the last checkpoint and only a few blocks remained, but then I couldn't control myself anymore.</t7240>
<t7241>"I don't know Ofglen very well," I said.</t7241> <t7242>"She relied on me before."</t7242>
<t7243>"Really?" she replied.</t7243> <t7244>She had opened her mouth to answer, no matter how guarded, which emboldened me.</t7244>
<t7245>“I just met her in May,” I said.</t7245> <t7246>I felt my skin heat up, my heart pounding.</t7246> <t7247>This matter is somewhat tricky.</t7247> <t7248>First of all, it’s a lie.</t7248> <t7249>Then how to get from there to the next crucial word? “Around the first of May, I think.</t7249> <t7250>It used to be called May Day.”</t7250>
<t7251>“Really?” she said, lightly, indifferently, threateningly.</t7251> <t7252>“I don't remember that word.</t7252> <t7253>It's surprising that you remember it.</t7253> <t7254>You should put in the effort...” she paused.</t7254> <t7255>“To clear your mind of all sorts of...”</t7255> <t7256>She paused again.</t7256> <t7257>“Echoes.</t7257><t7258>”</t7258>
<t7259>The cold came, spreading across my skin like water.</t7259> <t7260>It was her warning me.</t7260>
<t7261>She does not belong to the group.</t7261> <t7262>But she knows.</t7262>
<t7263>I walked to the end of the row of houses in horror.</t7263> <t7264>I did something foolish again.</t7264> <t7265>Not just foolish.</t7265> <t7266>This is something I had never realized before, but now I see: if Ofglen has been caught, Ofglen might talk, about me as well as others.</t7266> <t7267>She will talk.</t7267> <t7268>She won't be able to bear it.</t7268>
<t7269>But I haven't done anything yet, I told myself, nothing really.</t7269> <t7270>It's all just what I know.</t7270> <t7271>It's all just what I don't say.</t7271>
<t7272>They know where my child is.</t7272> <t7273>What if they bring the child, threaten to do something to them, right in front of me?</t7273> <t7274>Or actually do it.</t7274> <t7275>I don't dare to think what could happen next. Or Luke, if they already have Luke.</t7275> <t7276>Or my mother or Moira or almost anyone.</t7276> <t7277>God, don't make me choose.</t7277> <t7278>I wouldn't be able to face it, I know that; Moira was right about me.</t7278> <t7279>I would say whatever they want, I would accuse anyone.</t7279> <t7280>Indeed, just one scream, one uncontrollable sob, I would crumble, I would confess to every crime, I would go up dangling on the Wall's hook.</t7280> <t7281>Keep your head down, I often tell myself, and endure to the end.</t7281> <t7282>It's useless.</t7282>
<t7283>I kept discussing with myself like that, along the way home.</t7283>
<t7284>At the corner of the street, we turned to each other as usual.</t7284>
<t7285>"In His eyes," the new, uncertain Ofglen said.</t7285>
<t7286>"In his eyes," I said, she appeared enthusiastic.</t7286> <t7287>As if acting would make a difference, when we had reached this point.</t7287>
<t7288>Then she did something strange.</t7288> <t7289>She reached out, making the stiff blindfolds on our heads almost touch, making me look closely at her pale yellow eyes, the lines across her cheeks, and whispered, quickly, lightly like dry leaves. "She hanged herself," she said.</t7289> <t7290>"After the Redemption ceremony.</t7290> <t7291>She saw the van coming for her.</t7291> <t7292>It was better that way."</t7292>
<t7293>In an instant, she had stepped away on the sidewalk.</t7293>
<t7294>45</t7294>
<t7295>I stood for a moment, completely out of breath, as if I had just been kicked.</t7295>
<t7296>So she is dead, and I am safe, finally.</t7296> <t7297>She did it before they came.</t7297> <t7298>I feel incredibly relieved.</t7298> <t7299>I feel truly grateful.</t7299> <t7300>She died so that I could live.</t7300> <t7301>Mourning can wait.</t7301> <t7302>Unless this person is lying.</t7302> <t7303>There is always a possibility.</t7303>
<t7304>I inhale deeply, exhale, taking in more oxygen. The space in front of me becomes clearer, brighter.</t7304> <t7305>I can see the way.</t7305>
<t7306>I turned around, opened the gate, steadied myself for a moment, and stepped in.</t7306> <t7307>There was Nick, washing the car, whistling softly.</t7307> <t7308>He seemed so far away.</t7308>
<t7309>Oh Lord, I think, I will do everything you want.</t7309> <t7310>You have spared me, I will forsake myself, if you truly want that; I will empty myself, completely, will become the holy chalice.</t7310> <t7311>I will abandon Nick, I will forget those others, I will cease lamenting.</t7311> <t7312>I will accept my fate.</t7312> <t7313>I will dedicate myself.</t7313> <t7314>I will repent.</t7314> <t7315>I will surrender.</t7315> <t7316>I will renounce.</t7316>
<t7317>I know it's really not right, but that's what I thought.</t7317> <t7318>Everything taught at the Red Center, everything I still resisted, came flooding back.</t7318> <t7319>I don't want to.</t7319> <t7320>I don't want to be a dancer, kicking my legs up to the sky, my head wrapped in a long, faceless white cloth.</t7320> <t7321>I don't want to be a doll pinned to the Wall, I don't want to be a fallen angel.</t7321> <t7322>I want to keep living, in any form.</t7322> <t7323>I voluntarily surrender my body, for others to use.</t7323> <t7324>They can do whatever they want with me.</t7324> <t7325>I am insignificant.</t7325>
<t7326>I felt, for the first time, their full power.</t7326>
<t7327>I moved forward through the flower beds, the willows, aiming for the back door.</t7327> <t7328>I will go in, I will be safe.</t7328> <t7329>I will collapse to my knees, in my room, inhaling deeply the blessed foul air, faintly smelling of wood polish.</t7329>
<t7330>Serena Joy has gone out the front door, now she is standing on the steps.</t7330> <t7331>She calls me.</t7331> <t7332>What does she want?</t7332> <t7333>Does she want me to help roll the gray yarn in the sitting room? I won't be able to keep my hands steady, she will notice.</t7333> <t7334>But I still walk over to her, because there is no other way.</t7334>
<t7335>At the top step, she stood, towering over me.</t7335> <t7336>Her eyes blazing, the blue burning brightly against the shriveled white of her skin.</t7336> <t7337>I averted my gaze from her face, looking down at the ground; her feet, the tip of her cane.</t7337>
<t7338>“I trusted you,” she said.</t7338> <t7339>“I tried to help you.</t7339><t7340>”</t7340>
<t7341>I still did not look up at her.</t7341> <t7342>A feeling of guilt invaded me, I had been discovered, but what for? Among my countless misdeeds, which one was being accused?</t7342> <t7343>The only way to find out was to remain silent.</t7343> <t7344>Opening my mouth to explain, this and that, would only make things worse.</t7344> <t7345>I might reveal something she hadn't yet guessed.</t7345>
<t7346>It might be nothing.</t7346> <t7347>It could be a matchstick hidden in the bed.</t7347> <t7348>I let my head drop down.</t7348>
<t7349>“What?” she asked. “No excuses at all?”</t7349>
<t7350>I looked up at her. "About what?" I stammered.</t7350> <t7351>As soon as the words left my mouth, they sounded insolent.</t7351>
<t7352>“Look here,” she said.</t7352> <t7353>She raised her other hand from behind her back.</t7353> <t7354>In her hand was a cloak, the winter one.</t7354> <t7355>“There's a lipstick stain on it,” she said.</t7355> <t7356>“How could you be so vulgar? I told him...”</t7356> <t7357>She dropped the cloak, still holding something else, her hands bony and skeletal.</t7357> <t7358>She threw that down as well.</t7358> <t7359>Purple sequins scattered, sliding down the steps like snake skin, glittering in the sunlight.</t7359> <t7360>“Right behind my back,” she said.</t7360> <t7361>“You could have at least left something for me.” Did she love him, after all?</t7361> <t7362>She raised her cane.</t7362> <t7363>I thought she was going to hit me, but she didn't.</t7363> <t7364>“Pick up that disgusting thing and go to your room immediately.</t7364> <t7365>Just like the one before you.</t7365> <t7366>Filthy whore.</t7366> <t7367>In the end, it’s all the same.”</t7367>
<t7368>I bent down, picked it up.</t7368> <t7369>Behind me, Nick was already whistling.</t7369>
<t7370>I want to turn around, run to him, and hug him. That would be foolish.</t7370> <t7371>He can't help at all.</t7371> <t7372>He would drown too.</t7372>
<t7373>I went to the back door, into the kitchen, put down the basket, and went upstairs.</t7373> <t7374>I am orderly and calm.</t7374>
<t7375>Chapter XV - Night</t7375>
<t7376>46</t7376>
<t7377>I sit in my room, by the window, waiting.</t7377> <t7378>In my heart, a crumpled handful of stars.</t7378>
<t7379>Perhaps this is the last time I have to wait.</t7379> <t7380>But I don't know what I'm still waiting for.</t7380> <t7381>What else are you waiting for? people often say.</t7381> <t7382>That means hurry up.</t7382> <t7383>No need for an answer.</t7383> <t7384>What are you waiting for is a different question, and I don't have an answer for that either.</t7384>
<t7385>But this is not waiting, not exactly.</t7385> <t7386>It's more like a form of stagnation.</t7386> <t7387>Not waiting to untie the knot.</t7387> <t7388>In the end, there wasn't enough time.</t7388>
<t7389>I have fallen out of favor, which means losing grace.</t7389> <t7390>I should have been suffering more than this.</t7390>
<t7391>But I felt serene, peaceful, immersed in indifference.</t7391> <t7392>Don't let the bastards crush your home.</t7392> <t7393>I reminded myself that those words no longer had any meaning.</t7393> <t7394>It's no different from saying, Don't have air; or, Don't exist.</t7394>
<t7395>I guess one could say that.</t7395>
<t7396>There is no one in the garden.</t7396>
<t7397>I don't know if it's going to rain.</t7397>
<t7398>Outside, the sun is setting.</t7398> <t7399>The sky is already glowing.</t7399> <t7400>It will be dark soon.</t7400> <t7401>It's already darker now.</t7401> <t7402>It won't take long.</t7402>
<t7403>There are still some things I can do.</t7403> <t7404>I could set the house on fire, for example.</t7404> <t7405>I could gather the clothes and bed sheets into a bundle and strike a stored match.</t7405> <t7406>If the match doesn't light, then that's it.</t7406> <t7407>But if it does light, at least there would be an event, a kind of sign to remember the day I left.</t7407> <t7408>Just a little fire, very easy to put out.</t7408> <t7409>While waiting, I could smoke myself to suffocation.</t7409>
<t7410>You can tear the bed sheet into strips and twist them into a type of rope, tying one end to the bed leg to break the door.</t7410> <t7411>With unbreakable glass.</t7411>
<t7412>Maybe go find the Commander, collapse to the floor, hair disheveled, as they say, clutching his knees, confessing, sobbing, pleading.</t7412> <t7413>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum, I will say.</t7413> <t7414>It's not a prayer.</t7414> <t7415>I imagine his shoes, black, shiny, seamless, harboring their own private intentions.</t7415>
<t7416>Otherwise, one could put their head through the bed frame, hook it onto the closet handle, lean forward, and strangle themselves to death.</t7416>
<t7417>Could hide behind the door, wait for her to come, hobbling through the hallway, with any sentence, crime, punishment, jump at her, knock her down, kick her in the head hard and precisely.</t7417> <t7418>Free her from the torment, and myself too.</t7418> <t7419>Free her from the torment for both of us.</t7419>
<t7420>Will make up for lost time.</t7420>
<t7421>It is possible to calmly go downstairs through the front door to the main road, trying to act as if you know exactly where you are going, to see how far you can go.</t7421> <t7422>The red color is too striking.</t7422>
<t7423>Could go up to Nick's room, up above the garage, like before.</t7423> <t7424>Could wonder if he would let her in, give her shelter.</t7424> <t7425>Because now is the time she really needs it.</t7425>
<t7426>I absentmindedly think about these things.</t7426> <t7427>All possibilities seem to be approximately the same.</t7427> <t7428>None is more valuable than the other.</t7428> <t7429>Weakness has come here, into my body, seeping into my legs and eyelids.</t7429> <t7430>That is the state one will eventually fall into.</t7430> <t7431>Faith is also just a word, embroidered with thread.</t7431>
<t7432>I look out at the twilight and think it's winter now.</t7432> <t7433>Snowfall, gently, almost imperceptibly, burying everything in fine crystal, the moonlit mist before the rain, blurring outlines, erasing colors.</t7433> <t7434>Freezing to death is said to be painless, once the initial chill has passed.</t7434> <t7435>People lie like angels imprinted on the snow when the children have left and fallen asleep.</t7435>
<t7436>I feel her presence behind me, my grandmother, my version, hovering and spinning under the chandelier, body wrapped in star scales and feathers, wings halted mid-flight, the woman transformed into an angel, waiting to be discovered.</t7436> <t7437>This time, that person is me.</t7437> <t7438>How did I think I was alone here?</t7438> <t7439>There are always two.</t7439> <t7440>Finish it, she said.</t7440> <t7441>I'm tired of this play, tired of the silence.</t7441> <t7442>You can't protect anyone, your life is useless to anyone.</t7442> <t7443>I want it to end.</t7443>
<t7444>As I stood up, I heard the van.</t7444> <t7445>I heard it before I saw it; mingling in the twilight, it emerged from its own sound like a solid noise, like a block of winter night.</t7445> <t7446>It drove up the driveway and stopped.</t7446> <t7447>I only saw the white eye, two flapping wings.</t7447> <t7448>Probably using fluorescent paint.</t7448> <t7449>Two people separated from the black mass, stepped onto the front porch, and rang the bell.</t7449> <t7450>I heard the bell chime, downstairs, ding dong, like the ghost of a cosmetics consultant.</t7450>
<t7451>It gets even worse.</t7451>
<t7452>I have wasted time.</t7452> <t7453>I should have seized everything when I had the chance.</t7453> <t7454>I should have stolen the kitchen knife, found a way to get the sewing scissors.</t7454> <t7455>Also the garden shears, the knitting needles; there are weapons all around if one needs them.</t7455> <t7456>I should have paid attention.</t7456>
<t7457>But now it's too late to think, their feet have already tapped on the peach-pink ash-colored carpet of the stairs; their thudding footsteps swallowed the sound, veins on their foreheads throbbing.</t7457> <t7458>My back turned to the window.</t7458>
<t7459>I thought I would meet a stranger, but no one other than Nick pushed the door open and turned on the room light.</t7459> <t7460>I couldn't understand, unless he belonged to them.</t7460> <t7461>A possibility that was always left open.</t7461> <t7462>Nick, The secret eye.</t7462> <t7463>Dirty work needs dirty people.</t7463>
<t7464>Rotten scum, I thought.</t7464> <t7465>I opened my mouth to say it, but he moved closer, very close to me, and whispered. "It's okay.</t7465> <t7466>This is Mayday.</t7466> <t7467>Just go with them." He called me by my real name.</t7467> <t7468>But does that necessarily mean anything?</t7468>
<t7469>“Them?” I said.</t7469> <t7470>I saw two people behind him, the hallway ceiling light shining on their heads, making them look like skulls.</t7470> <t7471>“You’re crazy.” My pot of doubt hovered above him, an angel I haunted warned me to refuse.</t7471> <t7472>I almost saw it.</t7472> <t7473>So what if he knew Mavday? Every Eye must have known; they had been squeezed out, ground out, wrung out from so many bodies, so many throats already.</t7473>
<t7474>"Trust me," he said; a phrase that has never been enough as a talisman, guaranteeing nothing.</t7474>
<t7475>But I seized that offer.</t7475> <t7476>Besides it, I had nothing else.</t7476>
<t7477>One in front, one behind, they escorted me downstairs.</t7477> <t7478>Their steps were steady, the lights all bright.</t7478> <t7479>Apart from the fear, how normal it all seemed.</t7479> <t7480>From here, I could see the clock.</t7480> <t7481>What time it was, I couldn't tell.</t7481>
<t7482>Nick is no longer coming along.</t7482> <t7483>He probably went down the back stairs, not wanting to be seen.</t7483>
<t7484>Serena Joy stood in the hall, right under the mirror, looking up, in disbelief. The Commander was behind her, the door to the sitting room ajar.</t7484> <t7485>His hair was strangely gray.</t7485> <t7486>He looked worried and helpless, but had managed to step back from me, keeping his distance.</t7486> <t7487>No matter what I was to him, at this moment, I was a disaster.</t7487> <t7488>It was obvious they had just had a fight, because of me; it was obvious she had just scolded him.</t7488> <t7489>I still had enough strength to feel sorry for him.</t7489> <t7490>Moira was right, I am a coward.</t7490>
<t7491>“What did it do?” Serena Jov asked.</t7491> <t7492>So it wasn't her who called.</t7492> <t7493>If there was something saved for me, it wouldn't be this noisy.</t7493>
<t7494>“We cannot speak, madam,” the person in front of me said.</t7494> <t7495>“Please forgive us.</t7495><t7496>”</t7496>
<t7497>“I need a certificate of authority,” the Commander said.</t7497> <t7498>“Do you have a subpoena?”</t7498>
<t7499>Now I can scream, hold tightly to the stair railing, and throw away all dignity.</t7499> <t7500>I will block their way, even if just for a minute.</t7500> <t7501>If it's real, they will stay, if not, they will run away.</t7501> <t7502>Leaving me behind.</t7502>
<t7503>"It seems we don't need to, sir, but this is being done according to the law," the other person replied. "The crime of infringing on national secrets."</t7503>
<t7504>The commander put his hands on his head.</t7504> <t7505>What did I say, to whom, which of the enemies did you sense?</t7505> <t7506>It's very likely that by now you have become a security threat.</t7506> <t7507>I stand above you, looking down; you are shrinking.</t7507> <t7508>There has been purification, and there will be more.</t7508> <t7509>Serena Joy's face was pale.</t7509>
<t7510>"You promiscuous woman," she said.</t7510> <t7511>"He treats you like that."</t7511>
<t7512>Cora and Rita pushed and ran out of the kitchen.</t7512> <t7513>Cora was already crying.</t7513> <t7514>I was her hope, I let her down.</t7514> <t7515>Now she will never have children.</t7515>
<t7516>The van waited by the entrance, both doors wide open.</t7516> <t7517>The two of them, one on each side, grabbed my elbows and helped me in.</t7517> <t7518>Whether this was the end or a new beginning, I couldn't tell: I had entrusted myself to strangers, as there was no other way.</t7518>
<t7519>And so I stepped forward, into the darkness inside; or perhaps the light.</t7519>
<t7520>Historical Notes on the Tale of the Maidservant</t7520>
<t7521>Excerpt from the minutes of the Twelfth Gilead Studies Symposium, held within the framework of the International History Association Congress, at Denay University, Nunavit, on June 25, 2195.</t7521>
<t7522>Chair: Professor Maryann Trăng Non, Department of Anthropology, Denay University, Nunavit.</t7522>
<t7523>Main Speaker: Professor James Darcy Pieixoto, Director of the 20th-21st Century Archives, University of Cambridge, UK.</t7523>
<t7524>New Moon: I am honored to welcome all of you here this morning, and I am very pleased to see so many people have come to listen to Professor Pieixoto's talk, which I am sure will be fascinating and very valuable.</t7524> <t7525>We at the Gilead Research Association believe that this period in history promises many rewards for in-depth research, as it ultimately plays a major role in the redrawing of the world map, particularly in this hemisphere.</t7525>
<t7526>But before we continue, there are a few small announcements.</t7526> <t7527>Tomorrow's fishing trip will proceed as planned, and those who have not brought enough rain gear and insect repellent can purchase them for a nominal fee at the reception desk.</t7527> <t7528>The field trip and outdoor historical reenactment have been postponed to the day after tomorrow, as our infallible Professor Johnny Running Dog has confirmed that the weather will clear up by then.</t7528>
<t7529>I would also like to review other events hosted by the Gilead Research Association at this congress, which are also part of the seminar program.</t7529> <t7530>Tomorrow afternoon, Professor Gopal Chatterjee from the Department of Western Philosophy, Baroda University, India, will speak on "Krishna-Kali Elements in Early Gilead State Religion," and on Thursday morning, there will be a presentation by Professor Sieglinda Van Buren from the Department of Military History at San Antonio University, Republic of Texas.</t7530> <t7531>Professor Van Buren will deliver a lecture that I am sure will be captivating, with many illustrations, on "Warsaw Tactics: Urban Isolation Policies during the Gilead Civil War." I am certain all of us will want to attend these sessions.</t7531>
<t7532>I also have to remind our keynote speaker - although I'm sure this isn't necessary - not to exceed the allotted time, as we still want to have time for questions, and I believe none of us want to miss lunch, as happened yesterday.</t7532> <t7533>[The audience bursts into laughter.</t7533><t7534>]</t7534>
<t7535>Professor Pieixoto needs no introduction, as we are all familiar with him, if not directly then through his extensive works.</t7535> <t7536>Among them are "Regulation of Expenditure Through the Ages: An Analysis Based on Data" and the widely known study "Iran and Gilead: Two Theocracies of the Late 20th Century, Through Personal Diaries".</t7536> <t7537>As everyone knows, he is the co-editor, along with Professor Knotly Wade, also from Cambridge, of the manuscript being discussed today, and provided significant support in its transcription, annotation, and publication.</t7537> <t7538>The title of the talk is: "Issues in Authenticating 'The Handmaid's Tale'."</t7538>
<t7539>Welcome, professor.</t7539>
<t7540>[ Applause.</t7540><t7541>]</t7541>
<t7542>Pielxoto: Thank you very much.</t7542> <t7543>I trust we are all satisfied with the extremely delightful Arctic char we had for dinner last night, and now we are equally satisfied with an Arctic chairwoman who is no less delightful.</t7543> <t7544>I use the word "satisfied" in two different senses, leaving out, of course, the third, outdated one.</t7544> <t7545>[Loud laughter.</t7545><t7546>]</t7546>
<t7547>But let us discuss serious matters.</t7547> <t7548>I hope, as the title of today's casual conversation suggests, to consider a few issues related to what we might temporarily call the manuscript that everyone now knows well, known as The Handmaid's Tale.</t7548> <t7549>I say 'temporarily call' because what we have in our hands is not that item in its original form.</t7549> <t7550>To be precise, when it was first discovered, it was not at all a manuscript, nor did it have a title.</t7550> <t7551>The phrase "The Handmaid's Tale" was added much later by Professor Wade, partly to pay homage to the great Geoffrey Chaucer; but those who are well acquainted with Professor Wade, like myself, will understand when I say that I am certain every wordplay was intentional, specifically relating to the old colloquial meaning of the word "tail" - tail; which is the bone that everyone fights over, in the period of Gilead society that our epic refers to.</t7551> <t7552>[Laughter, applause.]</t7552>
<t7553>This item - I am careful not to use the word "document" - was found at a location that was once the city of Bangor, in the region that, before the events leading to the establishment of the Gilead regime, was the state of Maine.</t7553> <t7554>We know that this city was an important station on what our female author calls the "Underground Femaleroad," which some joking historians have now dubbed the "Chicken Run." </t7554> <t7555>[Laughter, jeers.]</t7555> <t7556>It is because of this that our association has paid special attention to it.</t7556>
<t7557>The origin of this item includes a personal iron chest, American military supplies, probably around 1955.</t7557> <t7558>This fact itself doesn't hold much significance, as we know that such chests were often sold as "surplus military supplies" and thus must have been quite common.</t7558> <t7559>The chest was sealed with tape commonly used for parcels, containing about thirty cassette tapes, which became obsolete around the 80s or 90s when CDs became popular.</t7559>
<t7560>I would like to reiterate that this is not the first discovery of its kind.</t7560> <t7561>Everyone is certainly familiar with, for example, the item known as "Memoir A.</t7561> <t7562>B," which appeared in a suburban garage</t7562> <t7563>in Seattle, and "Diary of P," accidentally unearthed during the construction of a new apartment building on the outskirts of what used to be Syracuse, New York.</t7563>
<t7564>Professor Wade and I were very excited about this discovery.</t7564> <t7565>Fortunately, a few years earlier, with the help of an outstanding archaeological technician residing at the school, we had successfully reconstructed a machine capable of playing these types of tapes, and immediately set to work on the arduous task of decoding them.</t7565>
<t7566>There are about thirty tapes in total, mixing music and narration in varying proportions.</t7566> <t7567>Generally, each tape would start with about two or three songs, obviously as a disguise, then the music would be interrupted by the narration.</t7567> <t7568>It is a woman's voice and, according to our voice analysis experts, consistent from beginning to end.</t7568> <t7569>The labels on the tapes are authentic contemporary labels, existing long before the events that marked the beginning of Gilead, of course, since such secular music was banned under the regime.</t7569> <t7570>For example, there are four tapes labeled "Elvis Presley - The Golden Years," three tapes labeled "Lithuanian Folk Songs," three tapes labeled "Boy George Unplugged," and two labeled "Mantovani, Soft Strings," as well as several other tapes not part of any set: "Twisted Sisters at Carnegie Hall" was a particularly favored one.</t7570>
<t7571>Even though the labels are all genuine, they do not always match the song on the tape.</t7571> <t7572>Furthermore, the thirty tapes are not arranged in any particular order, lying haphazardly at the bottom of the chest; they are also not numbered.</t7572> <t7573>Thus, Professor Wade and I took on the responsibility of arranging the segments in what seemed to be the appropriate order; but, as I mentioned elsewhere, all arrangements are based on conjecture and should only be considered approximate, requiring further investigation.</t7573>
<t7574>When we finally had the entire recording in hand - after having to review it repeatedly, overcoming difficulties due to dialects, unclear references, and obsolete words - we had to determine what type of document this painstakingly acquired material belonged to.</t7574> <t7575>Several possibilities were outlined.</t7575> <t7576>First, these tapes could be fake.</t7576> <t7577>As everyone knows, there have been several cases of such forgeries, all of which were bought by publishers for very large sums of money, clearly aiming to profit from the sensational nature of these stories.</t7577> <t7578>The situation is that certain periods in history will quickly become, both for external societies and subsequent ones, material for legends that are not very enlightening and a good opportunity for a lot of self-promotional propaganda.</t7578> <t7579>If allowed to add a few editorial comments, let me say that in my opinion, we need to be cautious when judging the Gilead period morally.</t7579> <t7580>By now, we should certainly understand that such judgments must necessarily be based on specific cultural circumstances.</t7580> <t7581>Furthermore, the Gilead society was under a lot of pressure, regarding population and many other things, and depended on many factors from which we fortunately have somewhat escaped.</t7581> <t7582>Our job is not to criticize but to understand.</t7582> <t7583>[Applause.]</t7583>
<t7584>Let's not digress: these kinds of tapes, however, are very difficult to convincingly fake, and we have the assurance of experts that these objects themselves are authentic.</t7584> <t7585>Surely the recording itself, meaning the act of overlaying speech onto music tape, could not have occurred within the last century and a half.</t7585>
<t7586>So let's assume that these tapes are real, what about the narrative itself?</t7586> <t7587>Clearly, it could not have been recorded at the time of the events being narrated, because if the author is telling the truth, at that time they would not have had access to equipment or tapes, nor would they have found a place to hide.</t7587> <t7588>Furthermore, the narrative contains a certain amount of reflective evaluation, which in my opinion rules out the above possibility.</t7588> <t7589>It has the semblance of emotions being recalled, if not when already at peace, then at least post-event.</t7589>
<t7590>If we can identify the narrator's identity, we imagine that we have made a significant step towards explaining how this document - I will call it that for convenience - came into existence.</t7590> <t7591>For that purpose, we have tried two directions of investigation.</t7591>
<t7592>First, we tried, through the old planning documents of the city of Bangor and other remaining materials, to identify who resided in the house located at the discovery site around that time.</t7592> <t7593>It is possible, we assumed, that this house was a "safe house" on the Underground Railroad during this period, and our author was hidden in the attic or basement, for instance, for weeks or months, and that was when she had the opportunity to record these tapes.</t7593> <t7594>Of course, it is not ruled out that the cassette tapes were brought to the mentioned location after being completed.</t7594> <t7595>We hope to be able to trace and find the descendants of the assumed homeowners, and hope they can provide other materials: diaries, for instance, or even family anecdotes passed down through generations.</t7595>
<t7596>But unfortunately, this turned out to be a dead end.</t7596> <t7597>It is possible that those people, if they were indeed links in the underground chain, had been exposed and arrested, in which case all documents mentioning them would have been destroyed.</t7597> <t7598>So we proceeded in the second direction.</t7598> <t7599>We researched all the literature of that period, trying to connect historical names with the characters appearing in our story.</t7599> <t7600>The remaining literature was quite fragmented, as the Gilead regime had the habit of erasing public computers and destroying all printed materials after a series of purges and internal upheavals, but some printed materials still survived.</t7600> <t7601>Some were even smuggled to England, serving the propaganda of women's relief organizations, which were rampant in the British Isles at that time.</t7601>
<t7602>We did not expect to locate the narrator herself.</t7602> <t7603>From the content, it is evident that she belongs to the first generation of women specifically recruited for reproductive purposes and assigned to those who both needed and had the means to obtain such services through their high social status.</t7603> <t7604>The regime created a supply in an instant simply by declaring all those married after divorce, as well as those living together without marriage, guilty of adultery, then arresting the women, and, based on the argument that they lacked moral competence, confiscating their children to place them in the homes of high-ranking childless couples who needed heirs at any cost.</t7604> <t7605>(By the mid-term, this policy had expanded to include all marriages not conducted within the state religion.) Thus, high-ranking men in the regime had the right to choose from among women who had proven their fertility by giving birth to at least one healthy child, a precious trait in an era when the birth rate of white Europeans was declining, a phenomenon not only seen in Gilead but in most Northern European societies at the time.</t7605>
<t7606>The causes of this decline are not clearly understood by us.</t7606> <t7607>Some can obviously be attributed to the widespread birth control measures, including abortions, during the immediate pre-Gilead period.</t7607> <t7608>Thus, some cases of sterilization were voluntary, which explains why there are different statistics between white Europeans and non-white Europeans, but the rest were not.</t7608> <t7609>Do I need to remind you that this was the era dominated by the R strain of syphilis and the infamous AIDS pandemic, which, once widespread in the community, rendered a large portion of sexually active young people infertile?</t7609> <t7610>Stillbirths, miscarriages, and genetic deformities were rampant and increasingly prevalent, and this situation was attributed to nuclear accidents, the characteristic shutdowns or sabotage of nuclear plants of the era, as well as leaks from chemical and biological weapon storage facilities, thousands of toxic waste dumps, both legal and illegal - in many cases, people simply dumped toxins into the sewage system - and the indiscriminate use of pesticides, herbicides, and similar chemicals.</t7610>
<t7611>But whatever the cause, the consequences were extremely serious, and Gilead was not the only government to react at that time.</t7611> <t7612>Romania, for example, preceded Gilead in the eighties by completely banning all forms of contraception, enforcing pregnancy tests on women, and encouraging childbirth through promotions and salary increases.</t7612>
<t7613>The need for what I shall temporarily call a birthing service was evident from pre-Gilead times, and it was met with many deficiencies through "artificial insemination," "birthing centers," and "biological mothers," who were compensated for this purpose.</t7613> <t7614>Gilead banned the first two forms, deeming them contrary to doctrine, but legalized and promoted the third, as it was considered to have a precedent in the Bible; thus replacing the form of asynchronous polygamy prevalent in pre-Gilead times with the older form of synchronous polygamy, present from the early Old Testament times and in the old state of Utah in the nineteenth century.</t7614> <t7615>As history teaches us, a new system that supplants an old one cannot help but integrate many pre-existing elements from its predecessor, as evidenced by the indigenous religious elements in medieval Christianity, or the emergence of the KGB from its Tsarist secret police predecessor; Gilead was no exception to this rule.</t7615> <t7616>The regime's racial segregation policies, for instance, were deeply rooted in pre-Gilead times, and it was this racial fear that fueled the emotional state allowing the Gilead takeover to proceed so smoothly.</t7616>
<t7617>Our author, therefore, is just one of many other examples, and must be viewed within the larger framework of the historical moment she existed in.</t7617> <t7618>But what else do we know about her, besides her age, a few physical characteristics that could apply to anyone, and her place of residence? Not much.</t7618> <t7619>She seems to be educated, insofar as a graduate student in North America at that time could be considered educated.</t7619> <t7620>[Laughter, a few boos.]</t7620> <t7621>But that kind, as people often say, is as common as mushrooms in the forest, so that information is not useful.</t7621> <t7622>She felt it was not necessary to let us know her real name, and in fact, all records of that name in official documents were likely destroyed when she entered the Rachel and Leah Reeducation Center.</t7622> <t7623>“Offred” provides no clues, because, like “Ofglen” and “Ofwarren”, it is structured as a patronymic, from the possessive preposition “of” and the name of the master.</t7623> <t7624>They take on that name when they join a specific Commander’s household, and lose it when they leave.</t7624>
<t7625>The remaining names in the document are the same, used for identification and authentication purposes.</t7625> <t7626>“Luke” or “Nick” do not provide any clues, just like “Moira” and “Janine”.</t7626> <t7627>It is highly likely that they, each one, are also just pseudonyms, intended to protect them in case the tapes were discovered.</t7627> <t7628>If so, this would confirm our view that these tapes were recorded within Gilead, not outside, and then smuggled back for the underground organization Mayday to use.</t7628>
<t7629>After eliminating the above possibilities, we were left with only one path.</t7629> <t7630>If we could identify this elusive "Commander," we felt that at least we would make some progress.</t7630> <t7631>We reasoned that such a high-ranking figure must have been present from the very first secret council of the Sons of Jacob, which laid the philosophical and social foundations of Gilead.</t7631> <t7632>This body was convened immediately after the acknowledgment of the armed stalemate between the superpowers and the signing of the top-secret Sphere of Influence treaty, which allowed the superpowers to choose, without external interference, how to deal with the increasingly frequent uprisings within their empires.</t7632> <t7633>The official records of all meetings of the Sons of Jacob were destroyed during the Great Purge around the mid-period, in which a significant number of the initial architects of Gilead were deposed and eliminated; however, we accessed some information through the encrypted diary of Wilfred Limpkin, one of the social biologists present at those meetings.</t7633> <t7634>(We all know that the theory of polygamy in nature from social biology was used as the scientific basis to justify many unusual rituals in the regime, just as Darwin's theory was used for many ideologies before it.)</t7634>
<t7635>From Limpkin, we selected two suitable individuals, meaning, two people with the name containing "Fred": Frederick R. Waterford and B. Frederick Judd, neither of whom left a photo, though Limpkin compared the latter to a stuffed shirt, and, I quote here, "a person for whom 'warming up' is something that happens on a golf course."</t7635> <t7636>[Laughter.]</t7636> <t7637>Limpkin himself did not survive long after Gilead was established, and we have his diary only because he foresaw his own end and entrusted it to his sister-in-law in Calgary.</t7637>
<t7638>Waterford and Judd both have characteristics that allow us to make connections.</t7638> <t7639>Waterford comes from the market research industry, and, according to Limpkin, is the one who designed the outfits for women, as well as suggested that the Handmaids wear red, seemingly borrowing the idea from the uniforms of German prisoners in camps in Canada during World War II.</t7639> <t7640>It seems he was the one who coined the term Pre-Processing, taken from a highly popular aesthetic program about thirty years before the end of that century; the ritual of collective rape, however, originated from a rural English custom in the seventeenth century.</t7640> <t7641>Redemption might also be his creation, even though by the time Gilead began, it had expanded from its original meaning in the Philippine islands to a general term for the elimination of political enemies.</t7641> <t7642>As I mentioned above, very little actually originated from or is unique to Gilead: its brilliant initiatives are due to synthesis.</t7642>
<t7643>Judd, on the other hand, seemed less concerned with packaging and more interested in tactics.</t7643> <t7644>It was he who suggested using a vague "CIA" leaflet teaching how to destabilize foreign governments as a strategic handbook for the Descendants of Jacob, and it was also he who outlined the initial hit list of prominent contemporary "Americans."</t7644> <t7645>He was also suspected of orchestrating the President's Day massacre, an act that required maximum infiltration into the security system around Congress, and without which the suspension of the Constitution would not have been possible.</t7645> <t7646>The national homeland and the ship carrying Jews were both his plans, as was the idea of privatizing the repatriation of Jews, which resulted in not just one ship being sunk to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to maximize profits.</t7646> <t7647>For Judd, as we know, this did not cause much concern. He was a hawk, with a remark recorded by Limpkin, "We made a big mistake teaching them to read.</t7647> <t7648>We will not repeat this."</t7648>
<t7649>It was Judd who is credited with establishing the form, not the name, of the Particicution ritual, arguing that it was not only a particularly terrifying and effective way to purge oneself of rebellious elements, but also served as a safety valve for the female elements in Gilead.</t7649> <t7650>The role of the scapegoat has been notorious throughout history, and the Handmaids, who are usually so oppressed, must have found extreme satisfaction in occasionally tearing a man apart with their bare hands.</t7650> <t7651>This practice became so widespread and effective that by the mid-period it became regular, occurring four times a year: at the spring equinox, fall equinox, summer solstice, and winter solstice. We see echoes of ancient fertility rituals dedicated to the Earth Goddess.</t7651> <t7652>As we heard in the group discussion yesterday afternoon, Gilead, despite its undeniably patriarchal form, carries matriarchal elements in its content, as some aspects of the social structure that gave birth to it.</t7652> <t7653>All the architects of Gilead knew that to lay the foundation for an effective totalitarian regime, or indeed any regime, it was necessary to provide certain privileges and freedoms, at least to a favored minority, to compensate for what had been taken away.</t7653>
<t7654>In this chain of associations, a few comments about the rather grand management apparatus of women under the name "aunts" might be necessary.</t7654> <t7655>Judd - still according to Limpkin - from the beginning advocated that the best and least costly way to control women for reproductive purposes and other purposes is to use women themselves.</t7655> <t7656>In this matter, there have been many precedents in history; in fact, no nation established by force or any other means lacks this aspect: governing the natives by their own tribe members.</t7656> <t7657>In the case of Gilead, many women voluntarily took on the role of "aunt," either because they genuinely believed in what they called "traditional values," or because of the benefits they could gain.</t7657> <t7658>When power becomes scarce, even a little bit is tempting.</t7658> <t7659>There is also a counter-motive: women who are childless, infertile, or old and unmarried can serve in the apparatus and escape the fate of becoming redundant, being shipped off to the notorious Colonies, designated for the mobile population primarily used in toxic waste cleanup teams, a kind of expendable army, though if lucky, one might be assigned less hazardous tasks, such as picking cotton or harvesting fruit.</t7659>
<t7660>Thus, the idea was Judd's, but the execution bore Waterford's mark. Who else in the Sons of Jacob's Command could have come up with the notion that the aunts would be named after commercial products aimed at women in the immediate pre-Gilead period, to make them feel familiar and secure - cosmetic brands, baking additives, dessert jellies, even medicinal remedies?</t7660> <t7661>It was truly a stroke of genius, further affirming our belief that Waterford, at his peak, was a creative genius.</t7661> <t7662>Judd, in his own way, was as well.</t7662>
<t7663>These two characters were both recorded as childless and thus qualified to consecutively receive Handmaids.</t7663> <t7664>Professor Wade and I hypothesized in our joint paper, “The Concept of ‘Breed’ in Early Gilead Society,” that both of them - as well as many other Commanders - had been exposed to a type of virus causing infertility, developed during pre-Gilead genetic modification experiments on the mumps virus, intended to be injected into the caviar supply for high-ranking officials in Moscow. (This experiment was canceled after the Sphere of Influence treaty, due to many opinions that the virus was too difficult to control and therefore too dangerous, although some still intended to spread it throughout India.)</t7664>
<t7665>However, neither Judd nor Waterford married any woman who had ever been named "Pam" or "Serena Joy." The latter name seems to be a somewhat malicious invention by the female author.</t7665> <t7666>Judd's wife is named Bambi Mae, while Waterford's wife is Thelma.</t7666> <t7667>The latter, however, was once a television personality of the type described.</t7667> <t7668>We know this thanks to Limpkin, through many spiteful remarks about it.</t7668> <t7669>The regime itself had to toil to cover up such unorthodox deviations in the pasts of the fiancées of high-ranking officials.</t7669>
<t7670>Overall, the evidence seems to lean towards Waterford. We know, for instance, that he was executed, presumably shortly after the events recounted here, during one of the earliest purges: he was accused of liberal tendencies, illegal possession of a large cache of subversive literature and images, and harboring a dissident.</t7670> <t7671>This happened before the trials began to take place in secret, while they were still being broadcast on television, so these events were recorded via satellite in England and remain in our video archives.</t7671> <t7672>The footage of Waterford is of rather poor quality, but clear enough to verify that he indeed had gray hair.</t7672>
<t7673>As for the rebel that Waterford was accused of harboring, it could be "Offred" herself, as her escape would clearly categorize her as such.</t7673> <t7674>But a more likely possibility is "Nick", whose very existence of these tapes proves that he helped "Offred" escape.</t7674> <t7675>The manner in which he conducted himself indicates that he is a member of the underground organization Mayday, which we do not yet fully understand, but is not the same as the Women's Network, though they are related.</t7675> <t7676>The Women's Network is simply a rescue operation, while Mayday is a semi-armed force.</t7676> <t7677>We know that some Mayday spies have infiltrated the highest echelons of Gilead's power, and placing a member as Waterford's driver would be a significant victory; a double victory, in fact, as "Nick" would also likely belong to the Eyes, as is common with other drivers or attendants.</t7677> <t7678>Waterford, of course, knew this, but since every high-ranking Commander naturally commands a team of Eyes, he did not pay much attention to it, nor did he let it hinder him from breaking the laws he considered trivial.</t7678> <t7679>Like most Commanders who were later purged, he believed his position exempted him from attack.</t7679> <t7680>By the mid-period of Gilead, people had become more cautious.</t7680>
<t7681>Our conjecture stops here.</t7681> <t7682>Assuming it is correct - that is, assuming Waterford is indeed the "Commander" in the story - there are still many gaps.</t7682> <t7683>Some of these could have been filled in by our anonymous author, had she had a different inclination.</t7683> <t7684>She could have provided much insight into the inner workings of the Gilead empire, had she possessed the instincts of a reporter or a spy.</t7684> <t7685>How much would we pay now to have even just twenty pages of printout from Waterford's personal computer! But let us be grateful for the crumbs the Goddess of history has graciously given us.</t7685>
<t7686>As for the ultimate fate of our female author, everything remains a mystery.</t7686> <t7687>Did she manage to escape across the Gilead border to what was then Canada, and from there make her way to England? That would have been a wise choice, as Canada at that time did not want to openly oppose its powerful neighbor, and there were many hunts and extraditions of such exiles.</t7687> <t7688>If so, why didn't she bring the tapes recording her story?</t7688> <t7689>Perhaps the departure was too sudden; perhaps she feared being intercepted.</t7689> <t7690>On the other hand, she might have been captured again.</t7690> <t7691>If she did indeed make it to England, why didn't she make her story public, as many others did when they reached the outside world?</t7691> <t7692>Perhaps she feared retaliation against "Luke," assuming he was still alive (an unlikely event), or even against her daughter; for the Gilead regime did not shy away from such measures, using them to suppress dissent in other countries.</t7692> <t7693>More than one careless refugee had received a hand, foot, or piece of an ear, sent by express mail in a vacuum-sealed bag, hidden in a coffee can, for instance.</t7693> <t7694>Or perhaps she was among the Handmaids who escaped but could not adapt to the outside world once they got there, after living under the previous protective regime.</t7694> <t7695>She might have, like them, withdrawn into seclusion.</t7695> <t7696>We have no way of knowing.</t7696>
<t7697>Likewise, we can only speculate on the motives that led "Nick" to rescue her.</t7697> <t7698>We can assume that once Ofglen, who was still paired with her, was found to be involved with Mayday, he himself also fell into danger, because as he understood well, through his experience as an Eye, Offred would certainly be taken in for questioning.</t7698> <t7699>The punishment for illicit sexual relations with a Handmaid is very severe; even the position of an Eye might not be enough to protect him.</t7699> <t7700>The society of Gilead is a Byzantium society pushed to the extreme, and any violation can be exploited by hidden enemies within the regime.</t7700> <t7701>He, of course, could still personally assassinate her, a choice that would be wiser, but human emotions must also be considered, and, as we know, both of them thought she might be pregnant with his child.</t7701> <t7702>In the era of Gilead, what man could resist the prospect of fatherhood, such an alluring and celebrated status?</t7702> <t7703>Instead, he called in a rescue team of Eyes, which could be real or fake but were nonetheless under his command.</t7703> <t7704>By doing so, he might have also hastened his own end, this too we will never know.</t7704>
<t7705>Will our female author safely make it to the outside world and create a new life for herself?</t7705> <t7706>Or was she discovered hiding in the attic, captured, taken to the Colonies or Jezebel's, or even executed? Our document, though eloquent in many respects, is completely silent on that matter.</t7706> <t7707>We can call Eurydice back from the underworld, but we cannot make her speak; and when she looks back at us, we only see her for a moment before she slips away from our grasp.</t7707> <t7708>As every historian knows, the past is a vast darkness, filled with echoes.</t7708> <t7709>Voices from it can reach us; but what they say is tinged with shadow as they travel through that labyrinth; and, no matter how hard we try, we cannot always decode them accurately when placed under the clear light of our own time.</t7709>
<t7710>Applause.</t7710>
<t7711>Does anyone want to ask anything?</t7711>
