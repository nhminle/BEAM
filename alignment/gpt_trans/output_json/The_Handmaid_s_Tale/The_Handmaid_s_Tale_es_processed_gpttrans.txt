<t0>I</t0>
<t1>THE NIGHT</t1>
<t2>CHAPTER 1</t2>
<t3>We slept in what had once been the gymnasium.</t3> <t4>The floor, made of varnished wood, had lines and circles painted on it for various sports.</t4> <t5>The basketball hoops were still there, but the nets had disappeared.</t5> <t6>The room was surrounded by a gallery for the audience; and I had the impression that I could perceive, like in a vague mirage, the acrid smell of sweat mixed with that sweet touch of chewing gum and the perfume of the girls who were among the audience, dressed in felt skirts — that's how I had seen them in the photos —, later in miniskirts, then in pants, finally with a single earring and styled with crests of green stripes.</t6> <t7>Dances had been held here; the music persisted, a palimpsest of sounds that no one listened to, one style after another, a background of drums, a melancholic wail, garlands of flowers made of tissue paper, cardboard demons, a rotating mirror ball that sprinkled the dancers with flakes of light.</t7>
<t8>In the room, there were reminiscences of sex and loneliness and expectation, the expectation of something without form or name.</t8> <t9>I remember that sensation, the longing for something that was always about to happen and was never the same, just as the hands that, without wasting time, caressed our lumbar region were not the same, or slipped between our clothes when we crouched in the parking lot or in the television room with the device muted and the images flickering over our exalted flesh.</t9>
<t10>We sighed for the future.</t10> <t11>Where did we get that talent for insatiability?</t11> <t12>It floated in the air; and it was still breathed in, like a late idea, when we tried to sleep on the army cots arranged in a row and separated from each other so we couldn't talk.</t12> <t13>We had cotton flannel sheets, like the ones children use, and army blankets, so old they still bore the initials U. S.</t13> <t14>We folded our clothes very neatly and left them on the stool at the foot of the bed.</t14> <t15>The lights would dim immediately but were never turned off.</t15> <t16>Aunt Sara and Aunt Elizabeth made the rounds; on their leather belts they carried electric prods like the ones used for cattle.</t16>
<t17>However, they did not carry weapons; not even those would have been entrusted to them.</t17> <t18>Their use was reserved for the Guardians, who were specially chosen from among the Angels.</t18> <t19>The presence of Guardians inside the building was not allowed, except when they were called; and we were not allowed to go out, except for our walks, twice a day and in pairs, around the football field that was now fenced with a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire.</t19> <t20>The Angels remained outside, turning their backs to us.</t20> <t21>For us, they were a source of fear, and also something more.</t21> <t22>If only they would look at us, if we could talk to them...</t22> <t23>We believed that we could exchange something, make a deal, reach an agreement, we still had our bodies...</t23> <t24>This was our fantasy.</t24>
<t25>We learned to whisper almost without making a sound.</t25> <t26>In the semi-darkness, when the Aunts weren't looking, we would stretch out our arms and touch each other's hands.</t26>
<t27>We learned to read the movement of the lips: with our heads pressed against the bed, lying on our sides, we watched each other's mouths.</t27> <t28>Thus, from one bed to another, we communicated the names: Alma, Janine, Dolores, Moira, June.</t28>
<t29>II</t29>
<t30>THE PURCHASE</t30>
<t31>CHAPTER 2</t31>
<t32>A chair, a table, a lamp.</t32> <t33>Above, on the white ceiling, a relief ornament in the shape of a garland, and in the center of it a blank space covered with plaster, like a face from which the eyes have been gouged out.</t33> <t34>There must have once been a chandelier there.</t34> <t35>But they have removed all the objects to which a rope could be tied.</t35>
<t36>A window, two white curtains.</t36> <t37>Under the window, a seat with a small cushion.</t37> <t38>When the window is partially opened –it only opens partially— air comes in and moves the curtains.</t38> <t39>I can sit in the chair, or on the window seat, with my hands crossed, and dedicate myself to contemplating.</t39> <t40>Sunlight also enters through the window and projects onto the narrow, highly waxed wooden floorboards.</t40>
<t41>I can smell the wax.</t41> <t42>On the floor, there is an oval rug, made from old braided rags.</t42> <t43>This is the kind of detail they like: folk art, archaic, made by women in their spare time with things that are no longer useful.</t43> <t44>A return to traditional values.</t44> <t45>Do not consume, do not desire.</t45> <t46>If I do not consume, why do I still desire?</t46>
<t47>On the wall, above the chair, a painting with a frame but without glass: it is a watercolor of flowers, of blue irises.</t47> <t48>Flowers are still allowed.</t48> <t49>I wonder if the others also have a painting, a chair, some white curtains.</t49> <t50>Are these items distributed by the government?</t50>
<t51>"Act as if you were in the army," said Aunt Lydia.</t51>
<t52>A bed.</t52> <t53>Single, with a semi-firm mattress covered by a white quilt filled with batting.</t53> <t54>In the bed, nothing is done except sleep... or not sleep.</t54> <t55>I try not to think too much.</t55> <t56>Like everything else, thought has to be rationed.</t56> <t57>There are many who cannot bear to think.</t57> <t58>Thinking can harm your chances, and I intend to resist.</t58> <t59>I know why the painting of the blue lilies has no glass, and why the window only opens partially, and why the window glass is shatterproof.</t59> <t60>What they fear is not that we might escape –after all, we wouldn't get very far— but those other exits, the ones you can open within yourself if you have a sharp mind.</t60>
<t61>So, apart from these details, this could be the guest room of a school, but the room for the less distinguished visitors; or a room in a guesthouse like the ones from before, suitable for ladies of limited means.</t61> <t62>This is where we are now.</t62> <t63>The possibilities have been reduced... for those of us who still have possibilities.</t63>
<t64>But the chair, the sunlight, the flowers... should not be despised.</t64> <t65>I am alive, I live, I breathe, I extend my open hand to the sunlight.</t65> <t66>The place where I am is not a prison but a privilege, as Aunt Lydia used to say, who loved extremes.</t66>
<t67>The bell that marks the time is ringing.</t67> <t68>Here, time is marked by bells, as it used to be in nunneries.</t68> <t69>And, also like in a convent, there are few mirrors.</t69>
<t70>I get up from the chair, take a step towards the sunlight with the red low-heeled shoes, designed to protect the spine but not for dancing.</t70> <t71>The red gloves are on the bed.</t71> <t72>I pick them up and put them on, finger by finger.</t72> <t73>Except for the headdress that surrounds my face, everything is red, the color of blood, which is what defines us.</t73>
<t74>The skirt is long down to the ankles and wide, gathered in a smooth yoke that covers the chest, and the sleeves are wide.</t74> <t75>The white headdress is mandatory; its purpose is to prevent us from seeing, and also from being seen.</t75> <t76>Red never suited me well, it's not my color.</t76> <t77>I grab the shopping basket and hang it on my arm.</t77>
<t78>The door of the room – not my room, I refuse to acknowledge it as mine</t78>
<t79>— it is not locked.</t79> <t80>In fact, it cannot even be adjusted.</t80> <t81>I step out into the hallway, waxed and covered with a central carpet of ashen pink color.</t81> <t82>Like a path in the forest, like a carpet for royalty, it shows me the way.</t82>
<t83>The carpet traces a curve and descends the stairs; I follow it, resting one hand on the banister that was once a tree, crafted in another century, polished to make it shine.</t83> <t84>The house is of late Victorian style and was built for a wealthy and large family.</t84> <t85>In the hallway, there is a pendulum clock that languidly marks the time, and then a door that leads to the maternal living room, populated with shadows.</t85> <t86>A room in which I never sit, I only stand or kneel.</t86> <t87>At the end of the hallway, above the front door, there is a fanlight with colored glass forming red and blue flowers.</t87>
<t88>On the wall of the living room, there is still a mirror.</t88> <t89>If I turn my head – in such a way that the white cap framing my face directs my vision towards it – I can see it while descending the stairs: a round, convex, full-body mirror, like a fish's eye, and my image reflected in it like a distorted shadow, a parody of something, like the figure from a fairy tale covered with a red cloak, descending towards a moment of indifference that is equal to danger.</t89> <t90>A sister, bathed in blood.</t90>
<t91>At the foot of the staircase, there is a coat rack for hats and umbrellas; it has long, rounded wooden bars that gently curve to form hooks, imitating the leaves of a fern.</t91> <t92>Several umbrellas hang from it: a black one for the Commander, a blue one for the Commander's Wife, and the one assigned to me, which is red.</t92> <t93>I leave the red umbrella in its place: through the window, I see the sun shining.</t93> <t94>I wonder if the Commander's Wife is in the living room.</t94> <t95>She is not always sitting there.</t95> <t96>Sometimes I hear her pacing back and forth, one strong step and then a soft one, and the dull tap of her cane on the ash-pink carpet.</t96>
<t97>I walk down the hallway, pass by the living room door and the one that leads to the dining room; I open the one at the end and enter the kitchen.</t97> <t98>It doesn't smell like waxed wood here.</t98>
<t99>I find Rita standing by the table painted with white enamel.</t99> <t100>She is wearing her usual Martha dress, of a dull green color, like a surgeon's gown from times past.</t100> <t101>The cut of her dress is very similar to mine, long and modest, but on top she wears an apron with a bib and has no cap or veil.</t101> <t102>She only wears the veil when going out, but no one cares too much who sees a Martha's face.</t102> <t103>Her dress is rolled up to her elbows, revealing her dark arms.</t103>
<t104>She is making bread, spreading the dough for the brief final kneading and to shape it.</t104>
<t105>Rita sees me and moves her head –it's hard to tell whether as a greeting or just becoming aware of my presence—; she wipes her flour-covered hands on her apron and rummages through the drawer in search of the voucher book.</t105>
<t106>He frowns, tears off three vouchers, and hands them to me.</t106> <t107>If he smiled, his face might appear kind.</t107> <t108>But his expression is not directed personally at me: he dislikes the red dress and what it represents.</t108> <t109>He thinks I might be contagious, like a disease or some kind of misfortune.</t109>
<t110>Sometimes I listen behind doors, something I would never have done before.</t110>
<t111>I don't listen for too long because I don't want to get caught.</t111> <t112>However, once I heard Rita telling Cora that she wouldn't lower herself in that way.</t112>
<t113>Nobody is asking you to, replied Cora.</t113> <t114>Anyway, what would you do if you could?</t114>
<t115>Going to the Colonies, stated Rita.</t115> <t116>They have an alternative.</t116>
<t117>With the No Women, starving to death and God knows what else?, asked Cora.</t117>
<t118>You are crazy.</t118>
<t119>They were shelling peas; even through the half-closed door, I could hear the clinking sound the peas made as they fell into the metal bowl.</t119> <t120>I heard Rita grunt or sigh, I don't know if in protest or approval.</t120>
<t121>Anyway, they do it for us, or so they say, continued Cora.</t121> <t122>If I didn't have my tubes tied, it could be me, if I were ten years younger.</t122> <t123>It's not that bad.</t123> <t124>It's not what you would call hard work.</t124>
<t125>She is better than me, said Rita, and at that moment I opened the door.</t125>
<t126>They had the expression that women have when you catch them talking about you behind your back and they think you’ve heard them: an expression of discomfort and at the same time defiance, as if they were within their rights.</t126> <t127>That day, Cora was kinder to me than usual and Rita more surly.</t127>
<t128>Today, despite Rita's impenetrable face and her tight lips, I would like to stay in the kitchen.</t128> <t129>Cora would come from somewhere else in the house with her bottle of lemon oil and her duster, and Rita would make coffee—in the Commanders' houses there is still real coffee—and we would sit around Rita's table—which belongs to her no more than mine belongs to me—and we would chat about ailments, illnesses, our feet, our backs, the different kinds of mischief that our bodies—as unruly creatures—</t129>
<t130>they are capable of committing.</t130> <t131>We would nod our heads, as if each nod punctuated the other's sentence, indicating that yes, we already know what it's about.</t131> <t132>We would exchange remedies and try to outdo each other in the recital of our physical miseries; we would lament quietly, in a low and sad voice, in a minor tone like the pigeons nesting in the gutters of buildings.</t132> <t133>I know what you mean, we would affirm.</t133> <t134>Or, using an expression still heard from the mouths of older people: I hear where you're coming from, as if the voice itself were a traveler arriving from some distant place.</t134> <t135>Which it could be, which it is.</t135>
<t136>I used to disdain this type of conversation.</t136> <t137>Now I desire it ardently.</t137> <t138>At least it is a conversation, a way to exchange something.</t138>
<t139>Or we would dedicate ourselves to gossiping.</t139> <t140>The Marthas know things, they talk among themselves and pass unofficial news from house to house.</t140> <t141>There is no doubt that they listen behind doors, like me, and see things despite those averted eyes.</t141> <t142>I have sometimes heard them, I have caught snippets of their private conversations.</t142> <t143>It was stillborn.</t143> <t144>Or: She stuck a knitting needle right into her belly.</t144> <t145>It must have been jealousy, which was devouring her.</t145> <t146>Or, in a tormenting tone: What she used was a cleaning product.</t146>
<t147>It worked like a charm, although anyone would say that he had tested it.</t147>
<t148>It must have been that drunkard; but they found her right away.</t148>
<t149>Or I would help Rita make the bread, sinking my hands into that soft and resilient warmth that resembles Flesh so much.</t149> <t150>I'm dying to touch something, something that isn't fabric or wood.</t150> <t151>I'm dying to commit the act of touching.</t151>
<t152>But even if they asked me, even if I breached decorum to that extent, Rita would not allow it.</t152> <t153>She would be too worried.</t153> <t154>The Marthas are not supposed to fraternize with us.</t154>
<t155>To fraternize means to behave like a brother.</t155> <t156>Luke told me that.</t156> <t157>He said there was no equivalent for behaving like a sister.</t157> <t158>According to him, it had to be sororize, from Latin.</t158> <t159>He liked knowing those kinds of details, the origins of words and their less common uses.</t159> <t160>I used to tease him for his pedantry.</t160>
<t161>I take the vouchers that Rita hands me.</t161> <t162>They have drawings of the foods they can be exchanged for: a dozen eggs, a piece of cheese, a brown thing that is supposed to be a steak.</t162> <t163>I put them in the zippered pocket of my sleeve, where I keep the pass.</t163>
<t164>—Tell them the eggs should be fresh —she warns me—.</t164> <t165>Not like last time.</t165> <t166>And make sure they give you a chicken, not a hen.</t166> <t167>Tell them who it's for and you'll see they won't mess it up.</t167>
<t168>—Agreed —I respond.</t168> <t169>I don't smile.</t169> <t170>Why tempt her with a friendly attitude?</t170>
<t171>CHAPTER 3</t171>
<t172>I go out through the back door to the garden, large and well-kept: in the middle, there is grass, a willow tree, and candlesticks; at the edges, flower beds: daffodils that are beginning to wither and tulips that are opening in a torrent of color.</t172> <t173>The tulips are red, and a darker crimson color near the stem, as if they had been wounded and were beginning to heal.</t173>
<t174>This garden is the realm of the Commander's Wife.</t174> <t175>Often, when I look out from my shatterproof glass window, I see her here, kneeling on a cushion, with a light blue veil over her large hat and beside her a basket with some scissors and pieces of thread to tie the flowers.</t175> <t176>The Guardian assigned.</t176> <t177>to the Commander is the one who performs the heavy task of digging the soil.</t177> <t178>The Commander's Wife directs the operation, pointing with her cane.</t178> <t179>Many Commanders' wives have gardens like this; that way they can give orders and keep themselves busy.</t179>
<t180>Once I had a garden.</t180> <t181>I remember the smell of the turned earth, the rounded shape of the opened bulbs, the dry crunch of the seeds between my fingers.</t181> <t182>That way, time passed more quickly.</t182> <t183>Sometimes the Commander's Wife takes a chair out to her garden and sits there.</t183> <t184>From a certain distance, she radiates a halo of peace.</t184>
<t185>Now she is not here, and I start to wonder where she might be: I don't like running into her by surprise.</t185> <t186>Perhaps she is sewing in the living room, with her arthritic left foot on the footstool.</t186> <t187>Or knitting scarves for the Angels who are on the front lines.</t187>
<t188>I find it hard to believe that the Angels need to wear those scarves; in any case, the Commander's Wife's scarves are very elaborate.</t188> <t189>She is not satisfied with the pattern of crosses and stars, like the other Wives, because it does not represent a challenge.</t189> <t190>At the ends of her scarves, fir trees, or eagles, or rigid humanoid figures parade: a boy, a girl, a boy, a girl.</t190> <t191>They are not scarves for adults but for children.</t191>
<t192>Sometimes I think that they are not sent to the Angels, but rather they are unraveled and turned back into balls of yarn to be woven again.</t192> <t193>Maybe it's only to keep them busy, to give meaning to their lives; but I envy the weaving of the Commander's Wife.</t193> <t194>It's good to have small, easily attainable goals.</t194>
<t195>And what does she envy about me?</t195>
<t196>She doesn't speak to me unless she can't avoid it.</t196> <t197>To her, I am a disgrace.</t197> <t198>And a necessity.</t198>
<t199>The first time we were face to face was five weeks ago, when I arrived at this detachment.</t199> <t200>The Guardian of the previous detachment accompanied me to the main door.</t200> <t201>The first few days we are allowed to use the main door, but afterwards we have to use the back ones.</t201> <t202>Things haven't stabilized, it's still too early and no one is sure of their exact situation.</t202> <t203>In a while, there will be nothing but main doors and back doors.</t203>
<t204>Aunt Lydia told me that she pressured them to let me use the front door.</t204>
<t205>Yours is a place of honor, he said.</t205>
<t206>The Guardian rang the bell for me, and the door opened immediately, in less time than it would take for someone to go and answer.</t206> <t207>Surely she was on the other side, waiting.</t207> <t208>I thought a Martha was going to appear, but instead, she came out, dressed in her unmistakable pale blue outfit.</t208>
<t209>So, you're the new one, she said to me.</t209> <t210>She didn't even move aside to let me in; she stayed in the doorway, blocking the entrance.</t210> <t211>She wanted me to realize that I couldn't enter the house unless she allowed it.</t211> <t212>These days, you always have the feeling that you're walking on a tightrope.</t212>
<t213>Yes, I replied.</t213>
<t214>Leave it on the porch, she told the Guardian, who was carrying my suitcase.</t214> <t215>It was made of red vinyl and not very large.</t215> <t216>I had another suitcase with my winter coat and thicker dresses, but they would bring it later.</t216>
<t217>The Guardian dropped the suitcase and greeted the Commander's Wife.</t217> <t218>Then I perceived his steps retracing the path, heard the click of the gate, and had the sensation of being stripped of a protective hand.</t218> <t219>The threshold of a new house is a desolate place.</t219>
<t220>She waited for the car to start and drive away.</t220> <t221>I didn't look at her face; I only looked at what I could perceive with my head down: her thick blue waist and her left hand on the ivory handle of her cane, the huge diamonds on the ring, which must have once been fine and still preserved well, the nail of a knobby finger filed into a smooth curve.</t221> <t222>It was as if that finger bore an ironic smile, as if it mocked her.</t222>
<t223>"You'd better come in," he said.</t223> <t224>He turned, giving me his back, and limped into the hallway.</t224> <t225>"And close the door."</t225>
<t226>I carried the red suitcase inside, as she surely wanted, and closed the door.</t226> <t227>I didn't say anything to her.</t227> <t228>Aunt Lydia said it was better not to speak unless you were asked a direct question.</t228> <t229>Try to put yourself in her place, she said, squeezing my hands and smiling with a nervous and pleading expression.</t229> <t230>It's not easy for them.</t230>
<t231>Here, said the Commander's Wife.</t231> <t232>When I entered the living room, she was already in her chair, her left foot on the footstool with its petit-point cushion embroidered with a basket of roses.</t232> <t233>She had the knitting on the floor, next to the chair, and the needles stuck into it.</t233>
<t234>I stood in front of her, with my hands crossed.</t234> <t235>All right, she said.</t235> <t236>She took a cigarette and placed it between her lips to light it.</t236> <t237>While holding it, her lips looked thin, framed by those vertical lines you see on the lips in cosmetic ads.</t237> <t238>The lighter was ivory-colored.</t238> <t239>The cigarettes must have been from the black market, I thought, which gave me hope.</t239> <t240>Even now that there's no real money, there is a black market.</t240> <t241>There is always a black market, there is always something that can be traded.</t241> <t242>She was a woman who could bend the rules.</t242> <t243>But what did I have to trade?</t243>
<t244>I looked at the cigarette with longing.</t244> <t245>For me, like alcoholic drinks and coffee, cigarettes are forbidden.</t245>
<t246>So that old fellow didn't work out, he said.</t246>
<t247>No, ma'am, I replied.</t247>
<t248>He let out something like a laugh and then coughed.</t248> <t249>Bad luck for you, he said.</t249> <t250>It's the second one, isn't it?</t250>
<t251>The third one, ma'am, I said.</t251>
<t252>And yours, he added.</t252> <t253>Another laugh and he coughed again.</t253> <t254>You can sit down.</t254> <t255>Don't make it a habit, it's just this once.</t255>
<t256>I sat on the edge of one of the straight-backed chairs.</t256> <t257>I didn't want to keep my gaze fixed or give the impression that I was distracted; so the marble shelf to my right, the mirror above it, and the bouquets of flowers were just shadows I caught out of the corner of my eye.</t257> <t258>Later on, I would have plenty of time to look at them.</t258>
<t259>Now her face was at the same height as mine.</t259> <t260>She seemed familiar to me, or at least I saw something familiar in her.</t260> <t261>A bit of her hair could be seen beneath the veil.</t261> <t262>It was still blonde.</t262> <t263>Then I thought that maybe she dyed it, that hair dye could be another one of the things she got on the black market, but now I know it's truly blonde.</t263> <t264>She had her eyebrows plucked into thin arched lines, which gave her a look of permanent surprise, or grievance, or inquisitiveness, like that of a frightened child, but her eyelids had a tired expression.</t264> <t265>Not so her eyes, a hostile blue like a midsummer sky in which the sun shines, an implacable blue.</t265>
<t266>At one time, her nose must have been pretty, but now it was too small in relation to her face, which wasn't fat but was large.</t266> <t267>From the corners of her lips, two descending lines emerged, and between them, her chin protruded, clenched as if it were a fist.</t267>
<t268>I want to see you as little as possible, he said.</t268> <t269>I hope you feel the same way about me.</t269>
<t270>I didn't respond: a yes could have been insulting, and a no, defiant.</t270>
<t271>I know you're not stupid, he continued.</t271> <t272>He took a drag and exhaled a puff of smoke.</t272>
<t273>I have read your file.</t273> <t274>As far as I am concerned, this is like a business transaction.</t274>
<t275>But if you cause me trouble, the problem will be yours.</t275>
<t276>Understood?</t276>
<t277>Yes, ma'am, I said.</t277>
<t278>And don't call me ma'am, she warned me irritably.</t278> <t279>You're not a Martha.</t279>
<t280>I didn't ask her how I was supposed to call her, because I realized that she trusted I wouldn't have the occasion to call her in any way.</t280> <t281>I felt disappointed.</t281> <t282>I had wished that she would become my older sister, a maternal figure, someone who would understand and protect me.</t282> <t283>The Wife of the detachment from which I came spent most of her time in her room; the Marthas said she drank.</t283> <t284>I wanted this one to be different.</t284> <t285>I wanted to believe that she had liked me, in another time and place, in another life.</t285> <t286>But I soon realized that she didn't like me, nor did I like her.</t286>
<t287>He put out the cigarette, without finishing it, in a small ashtray with scrolls on a little table that was beside him.</t287> <t288>He did it with a resolute attitude, giving it a sharp tap and then crushing it, instead of putting it out with a series of delicate taps, as almost all the other Wives were accustomed to doing.</t288>
<t289>As for my husband, she said, that's exactly what he is: my husband.</t289> <t290>I want this to be absolutely clear.</t290> <t291>Until death do us part.</t291> <t292>And that's it.</t292>
<t293>Yes, ma'am, I said again, forgetting her previous warning.</t293> <t294>In the past, little girls had dolls that talked when a string on their back was pulled; I had the impression that she spoke like one of them, with a monotonous voice, a doll's voice.</t294> <t295>Surely she fervently wished to slap me.</t295> <t296>They can punish us, there is a biblical precedent.</t296> <t297>But they cannot use any instruments; only their hands.</t297>
<t298>This is one of the things we fight for, said the Commander's Wife, and I noticed that she was not looking at me but at her knobby, diamond-laden hands; then I understood where I had seen her before.</t298>
<t299>The first time was on television, when I was eight or nine years old.</t299> <t300>On Sunday mornings, my mother would stay in bed sleeping, and I would get up early and sit in front of the television set in her study, clumsily switching from one channel to another, looking for cartoons.</t300> <t301>Sometimes, if I couldn't find them, I would watch The Hour of the Gospel for Innocent Souls, where they told biblical stories for children and sang hymns.</t301> <t302>One of the women was named Serena Joy.</t302> <t303>She was the soprano and main character, a petite woman with ash-blonde hair, a turned-up nose, and blue eyes that always looked up at the sky during the hymns.</t303> <t304>She was capable of laughing and crying at the same time, gracefully letting one or two tears slide down her cheeks, as if it were something rehearsed, while her voice rose with the highest notes, trembling, without any effort.</t304> <t305>It was later that she dedicated herself to other things.</t305>
<t306>The woman who was sitting in front of me was Serena Joy.</t306> <t307>Or she had been once.</t307> <t308>This was worse than I thought.</t308>
<t309>CHAPTER 4</t309>
<t310>I walk along the gravel path that cleanly divides the lawn as if it were a part in the hair.</t310> <t311>It rained last night: the grass is wet and the air is humid.</t311>
<t312>Everywhere there are worms —evidence of the soil's fertility— that have been caught by the sun, half-dead, flexible and pink, like lips.</t312>
<t313>I open the white picket gate, walk past the front lawn, and head towards the main entrance.</t313> <t314>One of the Guardians assigned to our house is washing the car in the driveway.</t314> <t315>That means the Commander is in the house, in his rooms on the other side of the dining room, where he seems to spend most of his time.</t315>
<t316>It's a very expensive car, a Whirlwind; better than a Chariot, much better than the heavy and practical Behemoth.</t316> <t317>It's black, of course the color of prestige —and of hearses— and long and elegant.</t317> <t318>The driver lovingly rubs it with a chamois.</t318> <t319>At least one thing hasn't changed: the way men take care of good cars.</t319>
<t320>He is wearing the Guardians' uniform, but he has the cap tilted jauntily and the shirt rolled up to the elbows, exposing his tanned forearms shaded by dark hair.</t320> <t321>He has a cigarette hooked in the corner of his lips, which shows that he also has something he can trade in the black market.</t321>
<t322>I know his name is Nick.</t322> <t323>I know because I heard Rita and Cora talking about him, and once I heard the Commander say to him: Nick, I won't need the car.</t323>
<t324>He lives here, in the house, above the garage.</t324> <t325>He belongs to a lower social class; he hasn't been assigned a woman, not even one.</t325> <t326>He doesn't meet the conditions: some defect, or lack of connections.</t326> <t327>But he acts as if he doesn't know or doesn't care.</t327> <t328>He is very carefree and not servile enough.</t328> <t329>It could be due to stupidity, but I don't think so.</t329>
<t330>They used to say that his behavior smelled fishy, or that it was suspicious.</t330> <t331>He is not well regarded because he is a misfit.</t331> <t332>Despite myself, I imagine how he must smell: not fishy, but like tanned skin, damp under the sun and infused with cigarette smoke.</t332> <t333>I sigh just thinking about it.</t333>
<t334>He looks at me and sees that I look at him.</t334> <t335>He has a Latino face, thin, angular, and wrinkles around his mouth from so much smiling.</t335> <t336>He takes one last drag on the cigarette, drops it to the ground, and steps on it.</t336> <t337>He starts to whistle and winks at me.</t337>
<t338>I lower my head, turn in such a way that the white hood hides my face, and start walking.</t338> <t339>He has taken the risk, but for what?</t339> <t340>And if I tried to betray him?</t340>
<t341>Maybe he just wanted to appear friendly.</t341> <t342>Maybe he saw my expression and misunderstood it.</t342> <t343>Actually, what I wanted was the cigarette.</t343>
<t344>Maybe he did it to test, to see my reaction.</t344>
<t345>Maybe it's a spy.</t345>
<t346>I open the main gate and close it behind me.</t346> <t347>I look down, but not back.</t347> <t348>The sidewalk is made of red bricks.</t348> <t349>I fix my gaze on the ground, a field of rectangles that form gentle waves where the earth, after decades and decades of winter frosts, has become warped.</t349> <t350>The color of the bricks is old, but fresh and clean.</t350> <t351>The sidewalks are kept cleaner than they used to be in the past.</t351>
<t352>I walk to the corner and wait.</t352> <t353>I couldn't stand waiting before.</t353> <t354>You can also serve simply by waiting, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t354> <t355>She made us memorize it.</t355>
<t356>He also said: Not all of you will overcome it.</t356> <t357>Some of you will fail or encounter obstacles.</t357> <t358>Some of you are weak.</t358> <t359>He had a mole on his chin that moved up and down as he spoke.</t359> <t360>He said: Imagine you are seeds, and immediately adopted a fawning and conspiratorial tone, like ballet teachers when they said to the children:</t360>
<t361>Now let's raise our arms... let's imagine that we are trees.</t361>
<t362>I am standing on the corner, pretending to be a tree.</t362>
<t363>A red figure with a face framed by a white bonnet, a figure like mine, an unremarkable woman, with a basket, walking towards me on the red brick sidewalk.</t363> <t364>She stops beside me and we look at each other's faces through the white tunnel that serves as our frame.</t364> <t365>She is the one I was waiting for.</t365>
<t366>—Blessed be the fruit —she says to me, pronouncing the accepted greeting among us.</t366>
<t367>—May the Lord allow it to mature —I recite the accepted response.</t367>
<t368>We turn and pass by the houses, heading towards the city center.</t368> <t369>We are not allowed to go there, except in pairs.</t369> <t370>It is supposed to be for our protection, although it is an absurd idea: we are already well protected.</t370> <t371>The reality is that she is my spy, and I am hers.</t371> <t372>If either of us makes a slip during one of our daily walks, the other bears the responsibility.</t372>
<t373>This woman has been my companion for the past two weeks.</t373> <t374>I don't know what happened to the previous one.</t374> <t375>One day she simply didn't show up, and this one was in her place.</t375> <t376>You don't ask questions about these kinds of things, because the answers are usually unpleasant.</t376> <t377>Anyway, there wouldn't be an answer either.</t377>
<t378>This one is a little chubbier than me.</t378> <t379>She has brown eyes.</t379> <t380>Her name is Deglen, and those are the two or three things I know about her.</t380> <t381>She walks demurely, with her head down, her hands in red gloves crossed in front, and with short steps, like those a pig trained to walk on its hind legs would take.</t381> <t382>During the walks, she has never said anything that is not strictly orthodox, so neither have I.</t382> <t383>She must be a true believer; in her case, being a Handmaid must be more than just a name.</t383> <t384>So I can't take the risk.</t384>
<t385>—I have heard that the war is going well —he comments.</t385>
<t386>—Praise be —I respond.</t386>
<t387>—We've had good weather.</t387>
<t388>—Which fills me with joy.</t388>
<t389>—Since yesterday, they have defeated more groups of rebels.</t389>
<t390>—Praise be —I say.</t390> <t391>I don't ask how you know—.</t391> <t392>What were they?</t392>
<t393>—Baptists.</t393> <t394>They had a fortress in the Blue Mountains.</t394> <t395>But they were forced to evacuate it with smoke bombs.</t395>
<t396>—Praise be.</t396>
<t397>Sometimes I wish he would shut up and let me walk in peace.</t397> <t398>But I am hungry for news, any kind of news; even if they were false, they would still mean something.</t398>
<t399>We arrived at the first barrier, which is like the ones used to block the way when doing construction work, or to lift manhole covers: a wooden cross painted with yellow and black stripes and a red hexagon that means Stop.</t399> <t400>Near the door, there are some lanterns that are off because it hasn't gotten dark yet.</t400> <t401>I know that above our heads there are lights attached to the telephone poles, which are used in emergencies; and that in the bunkers on both sides of the road, there are men stationed with machine guns.</t401> <t402>The headscarf that surrounds my face prevents me from seeing the lights and the bunkers.</t402> <t403>But I know they are there.</t403>
<t404>Behind the barrier, next to the narrow entrance, two men dressed in the green uniform of the Guardians of the Faith await us, with plumes on their epaulettes and a beret that features two crossed swords above a white triangle.</t404> <t405>The Guardians are not real soldiers.</t405> <t406>They are assigned guard duties and other menial tasks, such as digging the soil in the Commander's Wife's garden, and they are either stupid, old, invalid, or very young; and then there are the undercover Spies.</t406>
<t407>These two are very young: one of them still has a sparse mustache and the other a red face.</t407> <t408>Their youth is touching, but I know I must not deceive myself.</t408> <t409>Youths are often the most dangerous, the most fanatical, and the ones who get the most agitated when they have a weapon in their hands.</t409> <t410>They do not yet possess experience.</t410> <t411>One must be very tactful with them.</t411>
<t412>Last week, right here, they shot a woman.</t412> <t413>She was a Martha.</t413>
<t414>He was rummaging through his suit, looking for the pass, and they thought he was going to pull out a bomb.</t414> <t415>They took her for a man in disguise.</t415> <t416>There have been several incidents of this kind.</t416>
<t417>Rita and Cora knew that woman.</t417> <t418>I heard them talking about her in the kitchen.</t418>
<t419>They fulfilled their obligation, said Cora.</t419> <t420>To ensure our safety.</t420>
<t421>There is nothing more certain than death, said Rita angrily.</t421> <t422>She didn't bother anyone.</t422> <t423>There was no reason to shoot her.</t423>
<t424>It was an accident, replied Cora.</t424>
<t425>None of that, protested Rita.</t425> <t426>All of this is unpleasant.</t426> <t427>I could hear her moving the pots in the sink.</t427>
<t428>Well, anyway, they would think twice before blowing up this house, Cora stated.</t428>
<t429>It doesn't matter, replied Rita.</t429> <t430>She was very hardworking.</t430> <t431>She didn't deserve to die like that.</t431>
<t432>There are worse deaths, commented Cora.</t432> <t433>At least this one was quick.</t433>
<t434>You can say it, concluded Rita.</t434> <t435>I would prefer to have a little time.</t435> <t436>To fix things.</t436>
<t437>The two young Guardians greet us by bringing three fingers to the edge of their berets.</t437>
<t438>That is the signal for us.</t438> <t439>They are supposed to show us respect, due to the nature of our mission.</t439>
<t440>We take our passes out of the zippered pockets of our wide sleeves; they inspect and stamp them.</t440> <t441>One of the young men enters the fort on the right to punch the numbers on our passes with the Compuchec.</t441>
<t442>When he returns my pass, the man with the peach-colored mustache tilts his head, trying to get a look at my face.</t442> <t443>I lift my head a bit to help him; he looks into my eyes, I look into his, and he blushes.</t443> <t444>His face is long and sad, like that of a lamb, and he has large, deep eyes, like those of a dog... a spaniel, not a terrier.</t444> <t445>His skin is white and seems unhealthily fragile, like the skin beneath a scab.</t445> <t446>However, I imagine placing my hand on this exposed face.</t446> <t447>He is the one who pulls away.</t447>
<t448>This is an event, a small challenge to the norms, so brief that it may go unnoticed; but these moments are a reward that I reserve for myself, like the candy that, as a child, I hid in the back of a drawer.</t448>
<t449>Moments like this are an opportunity that opens up, like a tiny peephole.</t449>
<t450>And what if he came at night, when he is alone —although they would never allow him to be so alone—, and let him go beyond my veil?</t450> <t451>And what if I took off my red veil and exhibited myself before him, before them, under the uncertain light of the street lamps?</t451> <t452>This is what they must sometimes think, as they spend the dead hours behind this barrier that no one ever crosses except the Commanders of the Faith in their long, purring black cars, or their blue Wives, and their daughters with their white veils on their devout journey to Salvation or Prayvaganzas, or their plump green Marthas, or an occasional Birthmobile, or their red Handmaids, on foot.</t452> <t453>Or, sometimes, a van painted black, with the white eye on the side.</t453> <t454>The windows of the vans are dark, and the men in the front seat wear dark glasses: one darkness over another.</t454>
<t455>By the way, the vans are quieter than the rest of the cars.</t455> <t456>When they pass by, we look away.</t456> <t457>If any sound comes from inside, we try not to hear it.</t457>
<t458>Out of sight, out of mind.</t458>
<t459>When the vans arrive at a checkpoint, they are signaled to pass without stopping.</t459> <t460>The Guardians do not want to risk inspecting the interior and questioning their authority.</t460> <t461>Regardless of what they think.</t461>
<t462>If they think at all, although it's impossible to tell from their expression.</t462>
<t463>The most likely thing is that they don't think about anything promiscuous.</t463> <t464>If they think about a kiss, they must immediately think about the lights turning on and the rifle shots.</t464> <t465>In reality, they think about doing their job, about ascending to the category of Angels, maybe about being allowed to marry and, if they are capable of attaining enough power and reach old age, about being assigned a Handmaid just for them.</t465>
<t466>The man with the mustache opens the small gate for pedestrians, steps back to make room for us, and we pass through.</t466> <t467>I know that as we move forward, these two men—who are still not allowed to touch women—are watching us.</t467> <t468>However, they touch us with their eyes and I sway my hips a little and feel the swing of my wide skirt.</t468> <t469>It's like mocking someone from the other side of the fence, or teasing a dog with a bone by keeping it out of reach, and I immediately feel ashamed of my behavior because none of this is the fault of those men, they are too young.</t469>
<t470>Soon I discover that I am not actually ashamed.</t470> <t471>I enjoy the power: the power of a bone, which does nothing but is there.</t471> <t472>I harbor the hope that they will have a hard time looking at us and will have to rub against the barriers, surreptitiously.</t472> <t473>And</t473>
<t474>that later, at night, they suffer on the regiment's cots.</t474> <t475>Now they have no relief except their own bodies, and that is a sacrilege.</t475> <t476>There are no more magazines, no movies, no substitutes; only me and my shadow moving away from the two men, who stand rigidly by the barricade while watching our figures.</t476>
<t477>CHAPTER 5</t477>
<t478>I walk down the street accompanied by my double.</t478> <t479>Although we are no longer in the enclosed area of the Commanders, there are also huge houses here.</t479> <t480>In one of them, a Guardian can be seen mowing the lawn.</t480> <t481>The gardens are well-kept, the facades are beautiful and well-preserved; they are like those beautiful pictures that used to appear in house and garden magazines and interior design magazines.</t481> <t482>And the same absence of people, the same feeling that everything is asleep.</t482> <t483>The street is almost like a museum, as if it were part of a model of a city, made to show how people lived.</t483> <t484>And just like in those photos, those museums and those models, not a single child can be seen.</t484>
<t485>We are in the center of Gilead, where the war only reaches us through the television.</t485> <t486>We are not sure where the boundaries are; they vary according to the attacks and counterattacks.</t486> <t487>But this is the center, and here nothing moves.</t487> <t488>The Republic of Gilead, Aunt Lydia said, has no borders.</t488> <t489>Gilead is within you.</t489>
<t490>Once upon a time, doctors, lawyers, and university professors lived here.</t490> <t491>But now there are no more lawyers, and the universities are closed.</t491>
<t492>Sometimes, Luke and I would walk together through these streets.</t492> <t493>We would say that we would buy a house like this one, a big house, and that we would fix it up.</t493>
<t494>We would have a garden and swings for the children.</t494> <t495>Because we would have children.</t495> <t496>Even though we knew it was not very likely that we could afford such a luxury, at least it was a topic of conversation, a game for Sundays.</t496> <t497>Now, that freedom seems like a chimera.</t497>
<t498>At the corner, we turn onto the main street, where there is more traffic.</t498> <t499>Cars pass by, most of them black, and some gray or brown.</t499> <t500>There are other women with baskets, some dressed in red, others in the dull green of the Marthas, others in dresses with red, blue, and green stripes, cheap and modest, proof that they are the wives of the poorest men.</t500> <t501>They are called econowives.</t501> <t502>These women are not divided according to their functions, they have to do everything, if they can.</t502> <t503>Occasionally, you see a woman completely dressed in black, which means she is a widow.</t503>
<t504>There used to be more widows seen, but they seem to be disappearing.</t504>
<t505>You don't see Commanders' Wives on the sidewalks: they only ride in cars.</t505>
<t506>Here, the sidewalks are made of cement.</t506> <t507>I try not to step on the cracks, like children do.</t507>
<t508>I remember when I used to walk on these sidewalks, in different times, and the footwear I used to wear.</t508> <t509>Sometimes I wore running shoes with padded insides and little holes for the foot to breathe, and fluorescent fabric stars that reflected light in the dark.</t509> <t510>However, I never ran at night, and during the day I only did so on very crowded streets.</t510> <t511>Back then, women were not protected.</t511>
<t512>I remember the rules, rules that were not written, but that any woman knew: do not open the door to a stranger, even if he says he is a policeman; in that case, tell him to pass his identification card under the door.</t512> <t513>Do not stop on the road to help a motorist who seems to have a problem; do not brake and keep going.</t513> <t514>If someone gets in, do not turn around to look.</t514> <t515>Do not enter a laundromat alone at night.</t515>
<t516>I think about the laundromats.</t516> <t517>I think about what I used to wear to go: shorts, jeans, or tracksuit.</t517> <t518>And what I put in the washing machine: my own clothes, my own detergent, my own money, the money I had earned.</t518> <t519>I remember what it was like to keep track of the money.</t519>
<t520>Now we walk down the same street, two by two and in red, and no man shouts obscenities at us, nor speaks to us, nor touches us.</t520> <t521>No one whistles at us.</t521>
<t522>There is more than one kind of freedom, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t522> <t523>Freedom to and freedom from.</t523> <t524>In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to.</t524> <t525>Now we are given freedom from.</t525> <t526>Do not underrate it.</t526>
<t527>In front of us, to the right, is the shop where we ordered the dresses.</t527> <t528>Some people call them habits, a good definition: it's hard to give up habits.</t528>
<t529>On the store's facade, there is a huge wooden sign in the shape of a lily: it is called Wild Lilies.</t529> <t530>Below the lily, you can see the spot where the label was painted; but they decided that even the names of the stores were too much temptation for us.</t530> <t531>Now the stores are known only by the signs.</t531>
<t532>Before, Azucenas was a cinema.</t532> <t533>It was very popular among students; every spring the Humphrey Bogart festival was celebrated, with Lauren Bacall or Katherine Hepburn, independent and determined women.</t533> <t534>They wore buttoned blouses that suggested the various possibilities of the word loose.</t534> <t535>Those women could be Loose; or not.</t535> <t536>They seemed capable of choosing.</t536> <t537>In those times we seemed capable of choosing.</t537> <t538>We are a Society in decline, Aunt Lydia said, with too many choices.</t538>
<t539>I don't know when they stopped celebrating the festival.</t539> <t540>Surely I had already grown up.</t540>
<t541>That's why I didn't find out.</t541>
<t542>We didn't enter Azucenas; we crossed the street and walked along the sidewalk.</t542> <t543>The first place we entered was a store that also had a wooden sign: three eggs, a bee, and a cow.</t543> <t544>Milk and honey.</t544> <t545>There was a line; we joined it to wait our turn, always two by two.</t545> <t546>I saw that today they had oranges.</t546> <t547>Since Central America was lost to the Libertos, oranges have been hard to come by: sometimes they have them and sometimes they don't.</t547> <t548>Because of the war, not many oranges come from California either, and you can't count on the ones from Florida because of the barricades and the blowing up of the railroad tracks.</t548> <t549>I looked at the oranges and my mouth watered.</t549> <t550>But I hadn't brought any vouchers for oranges.</t550> <t551>It occurred to me that I could go back and tell Rita.</t551> <t552>She would love it.</t552> <t553>Showing up with the oranges would be a small triumph.</t553>
<t554>As they reach the counter, the women hand over their vouchers to the two men in Guardian uniforms, who are on the other side.</t554> <t555>Practically no one speaks, but there is a murmur and the women furtively move their heads, looking from side to side.</t555> <t556>It is at these moments, while shopping, that you might see someone you know from the old days, or from the Red Center.</t556> <t557>Just the sight of one of those faces would be exhilarating.</t557> <t558>If I could see Moira, just see her, know that she still exists...</t558> <t559>Now it is hard to remember what it means to have a friend.</t559>
<t560>But Deglen, who is next to me, does not look.</t560> <t561>Perhaps she no longer knows anyone.</t561> <t562>Maybe all the women she knew have disappeared.</t562> <t563>Maybe she doesn't want to be seen.</t563>
<t564>Remain silent, with your head down.</t564>
<t565>While we wait in double file, the door opens and two other women enter, both dressed in red and wearing the white bonnet of the Handmaids.</t565> <t566>One of them is pregnant; her belly, under the loose clothes, protrudes triumphantly.</t566> <t567>There is a stir in the room, a whisper is heard, some sighs; much to our dismay, we turn our heads shamelessly to get a better look.</t567> <t568>We feel an enormous desire to touch her.</t568> <t569>To us, she is a magical presence, an object of envy and desire, of covetousness.</t569> <t570>She is like a flag on the top of a mountain, the proof that something can still be done: we too can save ourselves.</t570>
<t571>The excitement is such that the women whisper, almost converse.</t571>
<t572>—Who is it? —I hear them ask behind me.</t572>
<t573>—Dewayne.</t573> <t574>No. Dewarren.</t574>
<t575>—How she shows off —someone murmurs, and it's true.</t575> <t576>A pregnant woman is not obligated to go out or go shopping.</t576> <t577>The daily walk is no longer mandatory, to maintain the proper functioning of her abdominal muscles.</t577> <t578>She only needs normal exercises and breathing exercises.</t578> <t579>She could stay at home.</t579> <t580>In reality, it is dangerous for her to go out, and there is always a Guardian waiting for her by the door.</t580>
<t581>Now that she is carrying a new life, she is closer to death and needs special protection.</t581> <t582>She could become jealous, which has happened in other cases.</t582>
<t583>Now all children are wanted, but not by everyone.</t583>
<t584>But the walk can be a craving, and if there hasn't been a miscarriage and the pregnancy has reached this point, they like to satisfy the cravings.</t584> <t585>Or maybe she is one of those who love to say: Make a pile, and I'll take it, in other words, a martyr.</t585> <t586>She looks around and I manage to see her face.</t586> <t587>The one who was murmuring was right: she has come to show off; she is brimming with health and enjoys every minute.</t587>
<t588>—Silence —says one of the Guardians from behind the counter, and we fall silent like schoolgirls.</t588>
<t589>Deglen and I have reached the counter.</t589> <t590>We hand over the vouchers and one of the Guardians records a number on them with the Compuperfo, while the other gives us our purchase, the milk and the eggs.</t590> <t591>We put them in our baskets and go back out, passing by the pregnant woman and her companion who, compared to the first, looks scrawny and wrinkled... just like all of us.</t591> <t592>The belly of a pregnant woman is like an immense fruit.</t592> <t593>Somoflafla, a word from my childhood.</t593>
<t594>She rests her hands on him, as if she wanted to defend him, or as if she were seeking warmth and strength within herself.</t594>
<t595>When I pass by, she looks me directly in the eyes, and then I recognize her.</t595> <t596>She was with me in the Red Center, she was one of Aunt Lydia's favorites.</t596> <t597>I never liked her.</t597>
<t598>In those times, her name was Janine.</t598>
<t599>Janine looks at me and an affected smile appears at the corners of her lips.</t599> <t600>She lowers her gaze to my belly—a board beneath the red suit—and touches it, covering her face.</t600>
<t601>I can only see a small piece of his forehead and the pink tip of his nose.</t601>
<t602>Then we enter All Meat, marked with a huge pork chop hanging from two chains.</t602> <t603>There isn't much of a line here: meat is expensive and even Commanders can't eat it every day.</t603> <t604>However —and this is the second time this week—, Deglen picks up steaks.</t604> <t605>I'll tell the Marthas: this is the kind of comment they love to hear.</t605> <t606>They are extremely interested in knowing how the other houses manage; these trivial gossip give them the opportunity to feel proud or disgusted.</t606>
<t607>I grab the chicken, wrapped in paraffin paper and tied with a string.</t607> <t608>There aren't many plastic things left anymore.</t608> <t609>I remember those white plastic bags they used to give out at supermarkets; how I hated wasting them, I would pile them up under the sink until there came a point when there were so many that when you opened the cabinet door, they would slip to the floor.</t609> <t610>Luke used to complain and every now and then he would take them all out and throw them away.</t610>
<t611>She could grab one and put it on her head, she warned me.</t611> <t612>You know the things children do when they play.</t612> <t613>She would never do that, I told her.</t613> <t614>She's grown up now.</t614> <t615>(Or</t615>
<t616>intelligent, or lucky.)</t616> <t617>But she felt a chill, and then guilt for having been so reckless.</t617> <t618>It was true, I took everything for granted, in those days I relied on luck.</t618> <t619>I'll store them in a higher cabinet, she said.</t619> <t620>Don't store them, Luke repeated.</t620>
<t621>We never used them.</t621> <t622>As garbage bags, I insisted, and he would tell me...</t622>
<t623>Not here.</t623> <t624>People are watching.</t624> <t625>I turn around and see my silhouette in the store window.</t625> <t626>So we went out, we are on the street...</t626>
<t627>A group of people approaches us.</t627> <t628>They are tourists, they seem to be from Japan, perhaps part of a commercial delegation, and they are visiting historical sites or admiring the local color.</t628> <t629>They are small and neatly dressed.</t629> <t630>Each one carries a camera and a smile.</t630> <t631>They observe everything attentively, tilting their heads to one side, like robins; their joy is aggressive and I can't stand looking at them.</t631>
<t632>It had been a long time since I had seen women with skirts like these.</t632> <t633>They reach exactly below the knees, and beneath the skirts, their almost bare legs can be seen with those fine and striking stockings, and the high-heeled shoes with straps clinging to their feet like delicate instruments of torture.</t633> <t634>They sway, as if their feet were nailed to uneven stilts; their backs are arched at the waist and their buttocks are prominent.</t634> <t635>They wear their heads uncovered and their hair loose in all its darkness and sexuality; their lips painted red, outlining the moist cavities of their mouths like the scribbles on the wall of a public restroom from another time.</t635>
<t636>I stop.</t636> <t637>Deglen stands next to me, and I understand that she also can't take her eyes off those women.</t637> <t638>They fascinate us and at the same time repulse us.</t638> <t639>It seems as if they were naked.</t639> <t640>How little time it has taken to change our mentality regarding these kinds of things.</t640>
<t641>Then I think: I used to dress like that.</t641> <t642>That was freedom.</t642>
<t643>Westernization, they used to call it.</t643>
<t644>The Japanese tourists approach us, anxious; we turn our heads, but it is already too late: they have seen our faces.</t644>
<t645>They are accompanied by an interpreter, dressed in a classic blue suit and a red patterned tie with a wing-shaped pin.</t645> <t646>He takes a step forward, moving away from the group and blocking our way.</t646> <t647>The tourists crowd behind him; one of them raises a camera.</t647>
<t648>—Excuse me —he says to us in a courteous tone—.</t648> <t649>They are asking if they can take a photo of you.</t649>
<t650>I fix my gaze on the sidewalk and shake my head negatively.</t650> <t651>They should only see a fragment of my face, my chin and part of my mouth.</t651> <t652>But not my eyes.</t652> <t653>I am very careful not to look the interpreter in the face.</t653> <t654>Most interpreters are Spies, or so the rumor goes.</t654>
<t655>I also take great care to say yes.</t655> <t656>Modesty and invisibility are synonyms, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t656> <t657>Never forget it.</t657> <t658>If they see you —if they see you, it is as if they penetrate you, she said with a trembling voice.</t658> <t659>And you, girls, must be impenetrable.</t659>
<t660>He called us girls.</t660>
<t661>Deglen, who is beside me, also remains silent.</t661> <t662>He has hidden his gloved hands inside his sleeves.</t662>
<t663>The interpreter turns towards the group and speaks haltingly.</t663> <t664>I know what he will be telling them, I know the drill.</t664> <t665>He will be telling them that the women here have different customs, that being observed through the lens of a camera is, for them, an experience of violation.</t665>
<t666>I still have my gaze fixed on the sidewalk, hypnotized by the women's feet.</t666>
<t667>One of them is wearing sandals that leave her toes in the open, and her nails are painted pink.</t667> <t668>I remember the smell of nail polish, and how it would wrinkle if you applied the second coat too soon, the satin texture of sheer stockings in contact with the skin, and the rubbing of toes pushed towards the shoe's opening by the weight of the entire body.</t668> <t669>The woman with the painted nails shifts her weight from one foot to the other.</t669> <t670>I almost feel her shoes on my own feet.</t670> <t671>The smell of nail polish has made me hungry.</t671>
<t672>—Excuse me —says the interpreter again to get our attention.</t672> <t673>I nod, letting him know that I heard him—.</t673> <t674>They ask if you are happy —he continues.</t674>
<t675>I can imagine the curiosity of these people: Are they happy? How can they be happy?</t675> <t676>I feel their bright eyes on us, how they lean forward a bit to catch our response, especially the women, although the men too: we are a mystery, something forbidden, we excite them.</t676>
<t677>Deglen says nothing.</t677> <t678>Silence reigns.</t678> <t679>But sometimes, not speaking is equally dangerous.</t679>
<t680>—Yes, we are very happy —I murmur.</t680> <t681>I have to say something.</t681> <t682>What else can I say?</t682>
<t683>CHAPTER 6</t683>
<t684>One block away from Todo Carne, Deglen stops, as if he couldn't decide which way to go.</t684> <t685>We have two possibilities: go back in a straight line, or take a detour.</t685> <t686>We already know which one we will choose because it's the one we always take.</t686>
<t687>—I would like to stop by the church —announces Deglen in a pious tone.</t687>
<t688>—Agreed —I respond, although I know just as well as she does what she intends.</t688>
<t689>We walked calmly.</t689> <t690>The sun has already set, and in the sky appear white, fleecy clouds, the kind that look like headless lambs.</t690> <t691>With the headgear we wear —the blinkers— it is difficult to look up and have a complete view of the sky, or of anything.</t691> <t692>But we manage it anyway, a little at a time, with a small movement of the head up and down, to one side and back.</t692> <t693>We have learned to see the world in fragments.</t693>
<t694>To the right, a street opens up that goes down to the river.</t694> <t695>There is a shed —where they used to store the rowing boats—, the occasional bridge, trees, green hills where one could sit to watch the water or the young people with bare arms lifting their oars while racing.</t695> <t696>On the way to the river, you find the old dormitories —which are now used for something else—, with their fairy tale towers painted in white, gold, and blue.</t696> <t697>When we evoke the past, we choose the beautiful things.</t697> <t698>We like to believe that everything was like that.</t698>
<t699>There is also the football stadium, where the Saviors of Men are hosted and where football matches are still played.</t699>
<t700>Now I never go to the river nor walk across the bridges.</t700> <t701>Nor to the subway, even though there is a station right there.</t701> <t702>We are not allowed entry, now there are Guardians and there is no official reason for us to go down those stairs and travel on those trains, under the river and to the main city.</t702> <t703>Why would we want to go from here to there?</t703> <t704>We could plot something bad, and they would find out.</t704>
<t705>The church is small, one of the first that were erected here, hundreds of years ago.</t705> <t706>It is no longer in use, except as a museum.</t706> <t707>Inside, you can see paintings of women in long, languid dresses, adorned with white hats, and respectable men with serious faces, dressed in dark suits.</t707> <t708>Our ancestors.</t708> <t709>Entrance is free.</t709>
<t710>However, we did not enter; we stayed on the entrance path, contemplating the cemetery. The old tombstones still remain, deteriorated by the passage of time, eroded, with the sign of the skull and crossbones and the inscription "memento mori," with fickle-faced angels and winged hourglasses.</t710>
<t711>—so that we remember how fleeting life is—, and the graves from a century later surrounded by willows as a sign of mourning.</t711>
<t712>They haven't bothered to touch the tombstones or the church.</t712> <t713>What offends them is the more recent history.</t713>
<t714>Deglen has her head down, as if she were praying.</t714> <t715>She is always like this.</t715> <t716>It occurs to me that maybe she has also lost someone, a specific person, a man, a child.</t716> <t717>But I am not entirely convinced.</t717> <t718>I think of her as someone who acts to be seen, someone who is performing rather than truly acting.</t718> <t719>I get the impression that she does these things to seem good.</t719> <t720>She is determined to conform.</t720>
<t721>But that must be the impression she has of me.</t721> <t722>Could it be any different?</t722>
<t723>We turn our backs to the church; there is what we have actually come to see: the Wall.</t723>
<t724>The Wall is also hundreds of years old, or at least more than a century.</t724> <t725>Like the sidewalks, it is made of red bricks, and it must have once been simple, yet beautiful.</t725> <t726>Now the gates are guarded by sentinels, and above them there are horrible spotlights mounted on metal poles, barbed wire at the bottom, and shards of glass at the top.</t726>
<t727>Nobody crosses these doors voluntarily.</t727> <t728>The precautions exist for those who try to leave, although reaching the Wall from the inside and avoiding the electronic alarm would be almost impossible.</t728>
<t729>Next to the main entrance, there are six other horns hanging from the neck, with their hands tied in front and their heads wrapped in white bags tied above the shoulders.</t729> <t730>Early this morning, they must have performed a Men's Salvage.</t730> <t731>I didn't hear the bells.</t731> <t732>Maybe I've already gotten used to them.</t732>
<t733>We stop at the same time, as if responding to a signal, and we stand looking at the bodies.</t733> <t734>It doesn't matter that we look.</t734> <t735>We can do it: that's what they're there for, hanging from the Wall.</t735> <t736>Sometimes they are there for entire days —until a new batch arrives—, so that as many people as possible can see them.</t736>
<t737>They are hung from hooks; the hooks have been forged with the brickwork of the Wall for this purpose.</t737> <t738>Not all of them are occupied.</t738> <t739>They look like grappling hooks, or question marks laid on their side.</t739>
<t740>The worst of all are the bags that wrap around the heads, even worse than the faces themselves would be.</t740> <t741>With them, the men look like dolls that haven't had their faces painted yet; or scarecrows, which in a way is what they are, because they are placed to scare away.</t741> <t742>It's as if their heads were sacks filled with some undifferentiated material, like flour or paste.</t742> <t743>It's the obvious heaviness of the heads, their emptiness, the way they hang down due to the force of gravity and the fact that there is no longer life within them to hold them up.</t743> <t744>They are like zeros.</t744>
<t745>However, looking very carefully, like us, you can see the outline of the features under the white cloth, like gray shadows.</t745> <t746>They look like the head of a snowman, with the coal eyes and the carrot nose fallen; and the head is melting.</t746>
<t747>But in one of the bags, there is blood that has seeped through the white fabric, where the mouth should be.</t747> <t748>The blood forms another mouth, small and red like the one a kindergarten child would paint with a thick brush.</t748> <t749>The idea a child has of a smile.</t749> <t750>Finally, attention is fixed on this bloody smile.</t750> <t751>After all, they are not snowmen.</t751>
<t752>The men wear white coats, like those worn by doctors or scientists.</t752> <t753>They are not always doctors and scientists, there are others too, but they must have taken them out this morning.</t753> <t754>Each one has a sign hanging from their neck, explaining why they were executed: the drawing of a fetus.</t754> <t755>They were doctors in those times, when these things were legal.</t755> <t756>Angel makers, they used to call them, or could it have been something else?</t756> <t757>They have been discovered now, by checking hospital records, or</t757>
<t758>—which seems more likely since, when it became clear what was going to happen, almost all hospitals destroyed that type of record— by interrogating informants: perhaps a former nurse, or a couple of them, because the testimony of a single woman is no longer accepted; or some other doctor who wanted to save his own skin; or someone who had already been accused, to harm his enemy, or at random, in a desperate attempt to save himself</t758> <t759>But informants are not always pardoned</t759> <t760>According to what we have been told, these men are like war criminals.</t760> <t761>The fact that their actions were legal at that time is no excuse: their crimes have retroactive effect.</t761> <t762>They committed atrocities, and they must serve as an example to others.</t762> <t763>Although it is practically unnecessary</t763> <t764>In these times, no woman in her right mind would try to prevent the birth of a child, if she were so fortunate as to conceive one.</t764>
<t765>We are supposed to feel hatred and contempt for those corpses.</t765>
<t766>But that is not what I feel.</t766> <t767>These bodies hanging from the Wall are time travelers, anachronisms.</t767> <t768>They come from the past.</t768>
<t769>What I feel for them is emptiness.</t769> <t770>What I feel is that I should not feel.</t770> <t771>What I feel is a certain relief because none of these men is Luke.</t771> <t772>Luke was not a doctor.</t772>
<t773>It is not.</t773>
<t774>I look at the one with the red smile.</t774> <t775>The red of the smile is the same as the red of the tulips in Serena Joy's garden, redder near the stem, where they start to heal.</t775> <t776>It's the same red, but there is no relation between the two.</t776> <t777>The tulips are not made of blood and the red smiles are not flowers, and neither of them refers to the other.</t777> <t778>The tulip is not a reason to disbelieve in the hanged man, and vice versa.</t778>
<t779>Each one is valid and is really there.</t779> <t780>It is through a field of valid objects like these that I must choose my path, every day and in every aspect.</t780>
<t781>I make a great effort to make such distinctions.</t781> <t782>I need to make them.</t782> <t783>I need to have very clear ideas.</t783>
<t784>I feel that the woman next to me is trembling.</t784> <t785>Is she crying?</t785> <t786>How could this make her seem good?</t786> <t787>I can't afford to find out.</t787>
<t788>I realize that I myself have my hands tightly around the handle of my basket.</t788> <t789>I am not going to reveal anything.</t789>
<t790>Normally, Aunt Lydia said, it is what is usually done.</t790> <t791>It may not seem normal to you now, but after a while it will be.</t791> <t792>It will become something normal.</t792>
<t793>III</t793>
<t794>THE NIGHT</t794>
<t795>CHAPTER 7</t795>
<t796>The night is for me, it belongs to me; I can do whatever I want, as long as I stay quiet.</t796> <t797>As long as I don't move.</t797> <t798>As long as I stretch out and stay still.</t798> <t799>There is a difference between stretching out and lying down.</t799> <t800>Lying down is always something passive.</t800> <t801>Men used to say: I would like to stretch out.</t801> <t802>Although sometimes they said: I would like to lie down with that girl.</t802> <t803>All of this is pure speculation.</t803> <t804>The truth is, I don't know what men used to say.</t804> <t805>I only know the words they used.</t805>
<t806>I stretch, then, inside the room, under the plaster eye of the ceiling, behind the white curtains, between the sheets, and I slide into my own time, abandoning the rhythm that they set for us.</t806> <t807>Although this is also part of the rhythm, and I am not outside of it.</t807>
<t808>But the night is for me.</t808> <t809>Where could I go?</t809>
<t810>To a pleasant place.</t810>
<t811>Moira was sitting on the edge of my bed, with her legs crossed in the Indian style, wearing a purple robe, a single earring, and golden nails to look eccentric; between her chubby fingers, she held a cigarette. Let's go get a beer.</t811>
<t812>You're going to fill the bed with ash, I protested.</t812>
<t813>If you did it, you wouldn't have these problems, he told me.</t813>
<t814>In half an hour, I assured him.</t814> <t815>The next day he had an exam.</t815> <t816>What was it about?</t816>
<t817>Psychology, literature, economics...</t817> <t818>We used to study subjects like those.</t818> <t819>On the floor of the room, there were several books, open and face down, placed haphazardly.</t819>
<t820>Now, said Moira.</t820> <t821>You don't need to put on makeup, it's just me.</t821> <t822>What is the exam about?</t822> <t823>I just took one and finished it in a jiffy.</t823>
<t824>A tris, I repeated.</t824> <t825>How original.</t825> <t826>It sounds like the name of a dessert.</t826> <t827>Tris flambeé.</t827>
<t828>Yes, yes, Moira laughed.</t828> <t829>Grab the coat.</t829>
<t830>She took it down herself and threw it to me.</t830> <t831>I'll take five dollars from you, okay?</t831>
<t832>To a park somewhere, with my mother.</t832> <t833>How old was I?</t833> <t834>It was so cold that we could see our breath; the trees had no leaves and there were only two disconsolate ducks in the pond.</t834> <t835>I had bread crumbs between my fingers and in my pocket...</t835>
<t836>Ah, yes: she told me that we were going to feed the ducks.</t836>
<t837>But there were some women burning books, in fact, she was there for that reason: to see her friends.</t837> <t838>She had lied to me; she was supposed to dedicate Saturday to me.</t838> <t839>I moved away from her, sulking, but the fire forced me to step back.</t839>
<t840>Among the women, there were also some men, and I could see that instead of books, there were magazines.</t840> <t841>They must have poured gasoline, because the flames were high, and then they started throwing magazines that they took out of some boxes, only a few at a time.</t841>
<t842>Some of them were singing; a few curious onlookers approached.</t842>
<t843>They had an expression of happiness, almost of ecstasy.</t843> <t844>Things that fire achieves.</t844>
<t845>Even my mother's face, always pale and thin, looked rosy and cheerful, like a Christmas postcard; there was another woman, tall, with a soot stain on her cheek and an orange knit cap, I remember her.</t845>
<t846>Do you want to throw one, honey? she asked me.</t846> <t847>How old would I have been?</t847>
<t848>Let's throw all this in the trash, he said, chuckling.</t848> <t849>Does that sound good to you?, he asked my mother.</t849>
<t850>If she wants to, my mother replied; she used to talk about me to others as if I couldn't hear her.</t850>
<t851>The woman handed me one of the magazines.</t851> <t852>In it, I saw a beautiful woman, without clothes, hanging from the ceiling with a chain tied to her hands.</t852> <t853>I looked at her with great interest.</t853>
<t854>It didn't scare me.</t854> <t855>I thought he was swinging, like Tarzan did with the vines on television.</t855>
<t856>Don't let him see it, said my mother.</t856> <t857>Come on, she urged me, throw it away, quickly.</t857>
<t858>I threw the magazine into the flames.</t858> <t859>The air produced by the fire caused it to open; huge flakes of paper loosened and flew over the flames, carrying different parts of the female bodies and turning them into black ashes before my eyes.</t859>
<t860>But what happened next, what happened next?</t860>
<t861>I know I lost track of time.</t861>
<t862>They must have injected me, they must have given me pills, or something like that.</t862> <t863>I can't have lost track of time to that extent without help.</t863> <t864>You've had a concussion, they told me.</t864>
<t865>I made my way through a sea of screams and confusion, like boiling foam.</t865>
<t866>I remember that I felt quite calm.</t866> <t867>I remember that I was screaming, it seemed to me that I was screaming, although it must have only been a whisper.</t867> <t868>Where is she? What have you done with her?</t868>
<t869>There was no night or day, only a blink.</t869> <t870>After a while, I began to see chairs, and a bed, and beyond that, a window.</t870>
<t871>She is in good hands, they told me.</t871> <t872>With people who are healthy.</t872> <t873>You are not healthy but you want the best for her, don't you?</t873>
<t874>They showed me a photo of her, standing in a small meadow; her face seemed like a closed oval.</t874> <t875>She wore her hair pulled back and tied at the nape of her neck.</t875> <t876>She was holding hands with a woman I didn't know.</t876> <t877>She was so small that she barely reached her elbow.</t877>
<t878>You have killed her, I said.</t878> <t879>She looked like an angel, solemn, compact, ethereal.</t879>
<t880>She was wearing a dress I had never seen her in before, white and long down to her feet.</t880>
<t881>I would like to believe that this is nothing more than a story I am telling.</t881> <t882>I need to believe it.</t882> <t883>I must believe it.</t883> <t884>Those who can believe that these stories are just tales have better chances.</t884>
<t885>If this is a story that I am telling, then I can decide the ending.</t885> <t886>There will be an ending to this story, and then real life will come.</t886> <t887>I can decide where to leave it.</t887>
<t888>This is not a story that I am telling.</t888>
<t889>It is also a story that I am telling, in my imagination, on the fly.</t889>
<t890>Counting, more than writing, because I have nothing to write with and, anyway, writing is forbidden.</t890> <t891>But if it's a story, even if only in my imagination, I have to tell it to someone.</t891> <t892>No one tells a story to themselves.</t892>
<t893>There is always another person.</t893>
<t894>Even if there is no one.</t894>
<t895>A story is like a letter.</t895> <t896>Dear, I would say.</t896> <t897>Just dear, without a name.</t897> <t898>Because if I added your name, I would add you to the real world, which is riskier and more dangerous: who knows what your chances of survival are?</t898> <t899>I will say dear, dear, as if it were an old love song.</t899> <t900>Dear can be anyone.</t900>
<t901>Dear, there can be thousands.</t901>
<t902>I will tell you that I am not in imminent danger.</t902>
<t903>I will act as if you hear me.</t903>
<t904>But it is not right, because I know you can't.</t904>
<t905>IV</t905>
<t906>THE WAITING ROOM</t906>
<t907>CHAPTER 8</t907>
<t908>The good weather continues.</t908> <t909>It's almost as if we were in June, when we take out our beach dresses and sandals, and buy ourselves ice cream.</t909> <t910>There are three new corpses on the Wall.</t910> <t911>One is that of a priest who is still wearing the black cassock.</t911> <t912>They put it on him for the trial, although they stopped wearing it a few years ago when the sect wars began; the cassocks drew too much attention.</t912> <t913>The other two have purple plaques hanging from their necks: Treason to their Gender.</t913> <t914>They are still dressed in the Guardians' uniform.</t914> <t915>They must have been caught together, but where? At the barracks?</t915> <t916>At a party?</t916> <t917>Who knows.</t917> <t918>The snowman with the red smile is no longer there.</t918>
<t919>—We should go back —I say to Deglen.</t919> <t920>It's always me who says it.</t920> <t921>Sometimes I think that if I didn't say it, she would stay here forever.</t921> <t922>But does she cry for these deaths, or does she revel in them?</t922> <t923>I still don't know.</t923>
<t924>Without a word, she turns, as if activated by my voice, as if she were moving on a pair of oiled wheels, as if she were the figure in a music box.</t924> <t925>Her grace offends me.</t925> <t926>Her docility offends me, her head inclined as if to counter a strong wind.</t926> <t927>But there is no wind.</t927> <t928>We move away from the Wall and return under the sun, along the same path we came.</t928>
<t929>—It is a beautiful May day —comments Deglen.</t929> <t930>More than seeing her, I feel that she turns her head towards me, as if expecting a response.</t930>
<t931>—Yes —I respond— Praise be —I add, as if I remembered at the last moment.</t931> <t932>A day in May; Mayday was a distress signal that used to be employed a long time ago in some of the wars we studied in school.</t932> <t933>I still confuse them, but if you paid attention you could distinguish them by the airplanes.</t933> <t934>It was Luke who told me about Mayday.</t934> <t935>Mayday was the code used by pilots of planes that had been hit, or ships... did ships use it too?</t935> <t936>Maybe ships used S.O.S. I would like to find out.</t936> <t937>And it was something about Beethoven, about the victory in one of those wars.</t937>
<t938>— Do you know where the word Mayday comes from? —Luke asked me.</t938>
<t939>—No —I replied—.</t939> <t940>It's strange that they used such a word for that, isn't it?</t940>
<t941>Newspapers and coffee on Sunday mornings, before she was born.</t941> <t942>Back then, newspapers still existed.</t942> <t943>We used to read them in bed.</t943>
<t944>—From French —he explained to me—.</t944> <t945>From M’aidez.</t945>
<t946>Help me.</t946>
<t947>A small procession approaches us, it is a funeral cortege: three women, each with a transparent black veil over their headgear.</t947> <t948>One of them is an econowife, and the other two are the mourners, also econowives and perhaps her friends.</t948> <t949>Their striped dresses seem worn out, just like their faces.</t949> <t950>Someday, when things get better, Aunt Lydia used to say, no one will have to be an econowife.</t950>
<t951>The first is the inconsolable mother; she carries a small black vessel.</t951> <t952>From the size of the vessel, one can guess the time it was in her womb when death came.</t952> <t953>Two or three months, too little to know whether it was a No Baby or not.</t953> <t954>They place the older ones and those who die at birth in boxes.</t954>
<t955>We stop as a sign of respect while the procession passes.</t955> <t956>I wonder if Deglen feels the same as I do, a pain in the gut, like a stab wound.</t956> <t957>We place our hands over our chests to express our condolences to these strangers.</t957> <t958>From beneath the veil, the first one gives us a threatening look.</t958>
<t959>One of the other two steps aside and spits on the sidewalk.</t959> <t960>The econowives don't like us.</t960>
<t961>We passed by the shops, reached the barriers, and went through them.</t961>
<t962>We continue walking among the houses with an uninhabited appearance and well-kept lawns.</t962> <t963>At the corner, near the house where I am assigned, Deglen stops and turns towards me.</t963>
<t964>— May His Gaze accompany you —he tells me, according to the proper farewell.</t964>
<t965>— May His Gaze accompany you —I respond and she nods with a slight movement.</t965> <t966>She hesitates, as if she were about to say something more, but then turns and starts walking down the street.</t966> <t967>I watch her.</t967> <t968>She is like my own image reflected in a mirror from which I am moving away.</t968>
<t969>On the driveway, I find Nick, who is still polishing the Whirlwind.</t969> <t970>He has reached the rear chrome part.</t970> <t971>I place my gloved hand on the gate handle, open it, and push it inward; it closes with a click.</t971> <t972>The tulips are redder than ever, open, now they don't look like cups but chalices; it's as if they were rising on their own, but for what purpose?</t972> <t973>After all, they are empty.</t973> <t974>When they grow, they turn inside out, slowly burst, and their petals fall off in pieces.</t974>
<t975>Nick looks up and starts to whistle.</t975> <t976>Then he asks me:</t976>
<t977>—Did the walk go well?</t977>
<t978>I nod my head, but I don't say anything.</t978> <t979>He is not supposed to talk to me.</t979>
<t980>Of course, some will try, said Aunt Lydia.</t980> <t981>The flesh is weak.</t981> <t982>The flesh is ephemeral, I corrected her mentally.</t982> <t983>They cannot bear it, she said, God made them that way.</t983> <t984>But He did not make you that way, He made you different.</t984> <t985>It is up to you to set the boundaries.</t985> <t986>Someday you will be grateful.</t986>
<t987>In the garden behind the house sits the Commander's Wife, seated in a chair she has brought out from inside.</t987> <t988>Serena Joy, what a stupid name.</t988> <t989>As if it were one of those things that used to be put in the hair to straighten it.</t989> <t990>Serena Joy, it must have said on the bottle, which surely had the silhouette of a female head engraved on the label over an oval pink background with gold scalloped edges.</t990> <t991>With all the names there are, why did she choose that one?</t991> <t992>Because Serena Joy was never her real name, not even then.</t992> <t993>Her real name was Pam.</t993> <t994>I read it in a biographical review in a magazine, long after seeing her sing on Sunday mornings while my mother slept.</t994> <t995>In those days, she deserved a biographical review: she must have appeared in Time or Newsweek.</t995>
<t996>Then she no longer sang, she gave speeches.</t996> <t997>And she did it well.</t997> <t998>She spoke about how sacred the home was, and that women should stay at home.</t998> <t999>She didn't do it, but she said it, and justified this failure of hers by arguing that it was a sacrifice she made for the good of everyone.</t999>
<t1000>Approximately around that time, someone tried to shoot her, but missed the target.</t1000> <t1001>Instead, they killed her secretary, who was standing directly behind her.</t1001>
<t1002>Another person installed a bomb in her car, but it exploded too soon.</t1002> <t1003>Although some people said that she herself had put the bomb in her car to gain the sympathy of the public.</t1003> <t1004>This is how things kept getting worse.</t1004>
<t1005>Luke and I sometimes watched her on the last news broadcast of the night.</t1005> <t1006>In a bathrobe and nightcap.</t1006> <t1007>We would gaze at her lacquered hair, her hysteria, the tears she could still summon at will, and the makeup that darkened her cheeks.</t1007> <t1008>Back then, she wore more makeup.</t1008> <t1009>We found her amusing.</t1009> <t1010>Or rather, Luke found her amusing.</t1010> <t1011>I only pretended to think so.</t1011> <t1012>In reality, she was a bit terrifying.</t1012> <t1013>She really was.</t1013>
<t1014>She no longer gives speeches.</t1014> <t1015>She has become mute.</t1015> <t1016>She stays at home, although this doesn't seem to suit her well.</t1016> <t1017>How furious she must be, now that they have taken her at her word.</t1017>
<t1018>She is contemplating the tulips.</t1018> <t1019>She has the cane on the ground, beside her.</t1019> <t1020>She is in profile, I can see her from the quick sideways glance I cast as I pass by.</t1020> <t1021>I would never look at her directly.</t1021> <t1022>She is no longer a perfect paper silhouette, her face is sinking into itself and makes me think of those cities built over underground rivers, where entire houses and streets disappear overnight into sudden marshes, or coal cities that sink into their own mines.</t1022> <t1023>Something like that must have happened to her when she saw the turn things were taking.</t1023>
<t1024>He doesn't turn his head.</t1024> <t1025>He doesn't acknowledge my presence in the slightest, even though he knows I'm there.</t1025> <t1026>I know he knows, his awareness is like a smell: something that turns sour, like milk after several days.</t1026>
<t1027>It is not the husbands you need to watch out for, Aunt Lydia used to say, but the Wives.</t1027> <t1028>You must always try to imagine what they feel.</t1028> <t1029>Of course they will offend you.</t1029> <t1030>It is natural.</t1030> <t1031>Try to pity them.</t1031> <t1032>Aunt Lydia believed she was very good at pitying others.</t1032> <t1033>Try to have compassion for them.</t1033> <t1034>Forgive them, for they know not what they do.</t1034> <t1035>And she would show that trembling beggar's smile again, raising her gaze—through her round steel-framed glasses—toward the back of the classroom, as if the green-painted ceiling were opening up and God were descending from it, riding a cloud of pearly pink face powder among the wires and pipes.</t1035> <t1036>You must understand that they are failed women.</t1036> <t1037>They have been unable to...</t1037>
<t1038>At this point, her voice would break, and she would pause, during which I could perceive a sigh around me, a collective sigh.</t1038> <t1039>It was not advisable to whisper or move during these pauses: Aunt Lydia might seem distracted, but she was aware of the slightest movement.</t1039> <t1040>That's why nothing more than a sigh could be heard.</t1040>
<t1041>The future is in your hands, he summarized.</t1041> <t1042>He extended his hands towards us, in that ancient gesture that meant both an offering and an invitation to an embrace, an acceptance.</t1042> <t1043>In your hands, he said, looking at his own as if they had given him the idea.</t1043> <t1044>But he saw nothing in them; they were empty.</t1044> <t1045>It was ours that were supposedly full of the future, a future that we held but could not see.</t1045>
<t1046>I walk around to the back door, open it, enter, and leave the basket on the kitchen table.</t1046> <t1047>The table has been scrubbed to remove the flour; the day's bread, freshly baked, is cooling on the rack.</t1047> <t1048>The kitchen smells of yeast, a scent filled with nostalgia.</t1048> <t1049>It reminds me of other kitchens, kitchens that were mine.</t1049> <t1050>It smells like mother, even though my mother didn't bake bread.</t1050> <t1051>It smells like me, a long time ago, when I was a mother.</t1051>
<t1052>It is a treacherous smell and I know I must ignore it.</t1052>
<t1053>Rita is sitting at the table, peeling and cutting carrots.</t1053> <t1054>They are old, thick, overripe carrots, and they have grown whiskers from being stored for so long.</t1054>
<t1055>The new, tender, and pale carrots will not be at their peak for a few weeks.</t1055> <t1056>The knife she uses is sharp and shiny, tempting.</t1056> <t1057>I would like to have one like this.</t1057>
<t1058>Rita stops cutting carrots, stands up, and takes the packages out of the basket, almost anxiously.</t1058> <t1059>She waits to see what I have brought, although she always frowns while opening the packages; nothing I bring pleases her.</t1059> <t1060>She thinks she would have done it better.</t1060> <t1061>She would like to do the shopping, to pick exactly what she wants; she envies my outings.</t1061>
<t1062>In this house, we all envy something about each other.</t1062>
<t1063>—They had oranges —I commented—.</t1063> <t1064>At Milk and Honey.</t1064> <t1065>There are still some left —I tell her as an offering.</t1065> <t1066>I want to ingratiate myself with her.</t1066> <t1067>I saw the oranges yesterday, but I didn't say anything to Rita: she was too grumpy—.</t1067> <t1068>If you give me the vouchers, I could get some tomorrow —I hand her the chicken; today she wanted steaks, but there weren't any.</t1068>
<t1069>Rita growls, but she does not express pleasure or acceptance.</t1069> <t1070>The growl means that she will think about it during her leisure time.</t1070> <t1071>She unties the string from the chicken package and opens the glazed paper.</t1071> <t1072>She touches the chicken with the tip of her fingers, folds a wing, sticks her finger into the cavity, and takes out the giblets.</t1072> <t1073>The chicken remains there, headless and footless, with goosebumps, as if it had chills.</t1073>
<t1074>—Today is bath day —announces Rita without looking at me.</t1074>
<t1075>Cora enters, coming from the back pantry where they keep the mops and brooms.</t1075>
<t1076>—A chicken —he says, almost with glee.</t1076>
<t1077>—Pure bone —states Rita—, but it will have to do.</t1077>
<t1078>—There weren't many more —I explain, but Rita ignores me.</t1078>
<t1079>—It seems quite big to me —Cora responds.</t1079> <t1080>Is she defending me?</t1080> <t1081>I look at her, to see if she smiles; but no, she was just thinking about the food.</t1081> <t1082>She is younger than Rita; the sunlight, now coming through the west window, touches her hair, parted and swept back.</t1082> <t1083>Until not long ago, she must have been pretty.</t1083> <t1084>She has a small mark like a dimple on each ear, where she used to have holes for earrings.</t1084>
<t1085>—Big —argues Rita—, but bony.</t1085> <t1086>You would have to speak louder —</t1086>
<t1087>he tells me, looking me in the face for the first time—.</t1087> <t1088>They are not ordinary, like you —she refers to the Commander's rank; but from the sense she gives to her words, she thinks I am ordinary.</t1088> <t1089>She is over sixty years old and her mentality will not change.</t1089>
<t1090>He goes to the sink, quickly runs his hands under the stream of water, and dries them with the kitchen towel.</t1090> <t1091>It is white with blue stripes.</t1091> <t1092>The kitchen towels are the same as always.</t1092> <t1093>Sometimes these flashes of normality attack me unexpectedly, as if ambushing me.</t1093> <t1094>The normal, the usual, a warning, like a kick.</t1094> <t1095>I observe the kitchen towel out of its context and it takes my breath away.</t1095> <t1096>For some, in a certain sense, things haven't changed that much.</t1096>
<t1097>—Who is taking care of the bathroom? —Rita asks Cora, not me—.</t1097> <t1098>I have to tenderize the chicken.</t1098>
<t1099>—I will do it later —Cora responds—, after dusting.</t1099>
<t1100>—If not, no one will do it —concludes Rita.</t1100>
<t1101>They talk about me as if I couldn't hear them.</t1101> <t1102>To them, I am just another household chore, one of many.</t1102>
<t1103>They have pushed me aside.</t1103> <t1104>I grab the basket, go out through the kitchen door, and walk down the hallway to the pendulum clock.</t1104> <t1105>The living room door is closed.</t1105> <t1106>The sun shines through the fanlight, painting the floor with colors: red, blue, purple.</t1106> <t1107>I step on it and stretch out my hands, which fill with flowers of light.</t1107> <t1108>I go up the stairs and see my face —distant, white, and distorted— framed in the hallway mirror, which protrudes like a flattened eye.</t1108> <t1109>I walk along the ash-pink carpet of the upstairs hallway, heading towards the bedroom.</t1109>
<t1110>I see someone standing in the hallway, near the room where I am staying.</t1110> <t1111>The hallway is dark; but I see a man, with his back to me.</t1111> <t1112>He is looking inside, and his silhouette is darkened against the light coming from the room.</t1112> <t1113>Now I see him: it is the Commander, he is not supposed to be here.</t1113> <t1114>He hears me coming, turns around, hesitates, and finally moves forward.</t1114> <t1115>He is coming towards me.</t1115> <t1116>He is breaking the rules.</t1116> <t1117>What do I do now?</t1117>
<t1118>I stop and he stands still; I can't see his face, he's looking at me, what does he want?</t1118> <t1119>But finally he returns</t1119>
<t1120>to advance, moves aside to avoid touching me, bows the head AND disappears.</t1120>
<t1121>Something has been revealed to me, but what?</t1121> <t1122>Like the flag of an unknown country, seen fleetingly at the curve of a hill; it could mean an attack, it could mean the possibility of negotiating, it could mean the end of something, of a territory.</t1122> <t1123>The signals that animals give each other: the lowered eyelids, the ears pulled back, the bristling hair.</t1123> <t1124>The flash of some teeth... but what the hell was I doing?</t1124> <t1125>No one else has seen it.</t1125> <t1126>I hope so.</t1126> <t1127>Was I invading the room?</t1127> <t1128>Was I in my room?</t1128>
<t1129>I have said my...</t1129>
<t1130>CHAPTER 9</t1130>
<t1131>My room, then.</t1131> <t1132>After all, there has to be some space that I can claim as my own, even in these times.</t1132>
<t1133>I am waiting in my room, which at this moment is a waiting room.</t1133>
<t1134>When I lie down, it is a bedroom.</t1134> <t1135>The curtains still flutter under the gentle breeze, outside the sun still shines, but it does not come through the window.</t1135> <t1136>It has moved to the west.</t1136> <t1137>I am trying not to tell stories, or at least not to tell this one.</t1137>
<t1138>Someone has lived in this room before me.</t1138> <t1139>Someone like me, or so I want to believe.</t1139>
<t1140>I discovered it three days after moving here.</t1140>
<t1141>I had to spend a lot of time here, and I decided to explore the room.</t1141> <t1142>Not lightly, as one might explore a hotel room, without expecting surprises, opening and closing the drawers, the closet doors, unwrapping the tiny bar of soap, and fiddling with the pillows.</t1142> <t1143>Will I ever be in a hotel room again?</t1143> <t1144>How I wasted those rooms and the freedom with which they could be observed.</t1144>
<t1145>Rented freedom.</t1145>
<t1146>In the afternoons, when Luke was still running away from his wife, when I was still imaginary to him.</t1146> <t1147>Before we got married and before I solidified.</t1147> <t1148>I always arrived first and checked in.</t1148> <t1149>It didn't happen many times, but now it seems like a decade, an era; I remember how I dressed, every blouse, every scarf.</t1149> <t1150>While I waited for him, I paced back and forth, turned the television on and off, dabbed some perfume behind my ears, it was called Opium.</t1150> <t1151>It came in a Chinese bottle, red and gold.</t1151>
<t1152>She was nervous.</t1152> <t1153>How did I come to know that he loved me?</t1153> <t1154>It was supposed to be just an affair.</t1154> <t1155>Why did we always say just?</t1155> <t1156>In those days, men and women tested each other, like trying on a suit, rejecting what didn't fit well.</t1156>
<t1157>Then they knocked on the door; I opened it, feeling relief and desire.</t1157> <t1158>Everything was so momentary, so condensed... and yet it seemed endless.</t1158> <t1159>Afterwards, we would lie on the bed, holding hands, chatting.</t1159> <t1160>About the possible, the impossible, about what could be done.</t1160> <t1161>We thought we had problems.</t1161> <t1162>How did we come to know that we were happy?</t1162>
<t1163>But now I also miss the rooms themselves, even the horrible paintings on the walls: landscapes of fallen leaves, or of snow melting on trees, or of women dressed in period costumes with porcelain doll faces and parasols, or of sad-looking clowns, or of bowls with stiff, chalky-looking fruit.</t1163> <t1164>The new disposable towels, the enticing wastebaskets, beckoning to the carelessly discarded trash on the floor.</t1164>
<t1165>Carefree.</t1165> <t1166>In those rooms, I became a carefree person.</t1166> <t1167>I could pick up the phone, and food would immediately appear on a tray, the food I had chosen.</t1167> <t1168>But it was bad, just like the drink.</t1168>
<t1169>In the drawers of the dressers, you could find copies of the Bible, placed there by some charitable institution, although probably no one ever read them.</t1169>
<t1170>There were also postcards</t1170> <t1171>With a photo of the hotel, and you could write on them and send them to someone.</t1171> <t1172>Now all of this seems impossible; as if one had made it up.</t1172>
<t1173>Good.</t1173> <t1174>So I explored this room, not casually, like a hotel room.</t1174> <t1175>I didn't want to do it all at once, I wanted it to last.</t1175> <t1176>I mentally divided the room into sectors; I assigned myself one sector per day and examined it with the utmost thoroughness: the irregularity of the plaster beneath the wallpaper, the scratches on the paint of the baseboard and the windowsill, the stains on the mattress... because I even went so far as to lift the blankets and sheets off the bed and turn them over, a little at a time so I could quickly put them back in place if someone came.</t1176>
<t1177>The stains on the mattress.</t1177> <t1178>Like petals of dried flowers They were not recent, but from an old love; now there is no other kind of love in the room.</t1178>
<t1179>When I saw them, when I saw the evidence that two people had left of their love, or something like it, at least of desire, at least of contact between two who might now be elderly or dead, I covered the bed again and lay down on top of it.</t1179> <t1180>I looked up at the plaster eye of the ceiling.</t1180> <t1181>I wanted to feel that Luke was lying next to me.</t1181>
<t1182>I often suffer from these attacks of the past, like fainting spells, like a wave that invades my mind.</t1182> <t1183>Sometimes I can barely endure it.</t1183> <t1184>What can I do, what can I do?, I think.</t1184> <t1185>There is nothing to be done.</t1185> <t1186>You can also serve by standing and waiting.</t1186> <t1187>Or lying down and waiting.</t1187> <t1188>I already know why the window glass is unbreakable.</t1188> <t1189>And why they removed the chandelier.</t1189> <t1190>I wanted to feel Luke lying next to me, but there was no space.</t1190>
<t1191>I reserved the wardrobe for the third day.</t1191> <t1192>First, I carefully looked at the door, inside and out, and then the walls and their brass hooks; why had they overlooked the hooks?</t1192> <t1193>Why hadn't they removed them?</t1193> <t1194>Were they too close to the floor?</t1194> <t1195>However, all you needed was a sock.</t1195> <t1196>And the rod with the plastic hangers and my dresses hanging from them, the red wool cape for cold days, the shawl.</t1196> <t1197>I knelt to examine the floor and there it was, in tiny letters, quite recent from the looks of it, marked with a pin, or perhaps simply with a fingernail, in the darkest corner: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t1197>
<t1198>I didn't know what it meant, nor what language it was.</t1198> <t1199>I thought it might be Latin, but I didn't know anything about Latin.</t1199> <t1200>However, it was a message, and it was written, an act forbidden in itself, and it had not yet been discovered.</t1200> <t1201>Except by me, to whom it was addressed.</t1201> <t1202>It was addressed to whoever came after.</t1202>
<t1203>I like to reflect on this message.</t1203> <t1204>I like to think that I communicate with her, with this unknown woman.</t1204> <t1205>Because she is unknown; and, if she is known, she was never mentioned to me.</t1205> <t1206>I like knowing that her taboo message has managed to endure at least so that another person could see it and that, although hidden on the wall of my closet, I opened the door and read it.</t1206> <t1207>Sometimes I repeat the words to myself.</t1207> <t1208>They provide me with a small joy.</t1208> <t1209>When I imagine the woman who wrote them, I think she is approximately my age, perhaps a bit younger.</t1209> <t1210>I identify her with Moira, just as she was when she went to university and occupied the room next to mine: witty, lively, athletic, riding a bicycle and with a backpack on her back, ready for hiking.</t1210> <t1211>Freckled, I think; disrespectful and clever.</t1211>
<t1212>I wonder who she was or who she is, and what has become of her.</t1212>
<t1213>The day I found the message, I gauged Rita's mood.</t1213>
<t1214>Who was the woman that was in that room?, I asked him.</t1214> <t1215>The one who was there before me?</t1215> <t1216>If I had asked him a different question, if I had said: Was there any woman in that room before me?, maybe I wouldn't have gotten any answer.</t1216>
<t1217>"Which one?" he asked me; he seemed to speak to me reluctantly, with suspicion, but in the end, he almost always did when he talked to me.</t1217>
<t1218>Then there had been more than one.</t1218> <t1219>Some had not stayed at their destination for the full period they were supposed to, two complete years.</t1219> <t1220>Some had been dismissed, for one reason or another.</t1220> <t1221>Or maybe they hadn't been dismissed; could they be dead?</t1221>
<t1222>The one who was so cheerful, I took a risk.</t1222> <t1223>The one with the freckles.</t1223>
<t1224>Did you know her? Rita asked me, more suspicious than ever.</t1224>
<t1225>I had seen her, I lied.</t1225> <t1226>I heard it said that she was here.</t1226>
<t1227>Rita admitted it.</t1227> <t1228>She knows that there is a possibility that rumors might spread, or that there might be some sort of clandestine information.</t1228>
<t1229>It didn't work, he replied.</t1229>
<t1230>In what sense?, I asked, trying to appear as neutral as possible.</t1230>
<t1231>But Rita pressed her lips together.</t1231> <t1232>Here I am like a child; there are some things that should not be told to me.</t1232> <t1233>What you don't know won't hurt you, would have been her entire response.</t1233>
<t1234>CHAPTER 10</t1234>
<t1235>Sometimes I sing to myself, mentally; it is a Presbyterian song, gloomy and sad:</t1235>
<t1236>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound</t1236>
<t1237>What could save an unfortunate person like me,</t1237>
<t1238>Once lost and now saved,</t1238>
<t1239>Once bound and now freed.</t1239>
<t1240>I don't know if the lyrics were exactly like that.</t1240> <t1241>I can't remember them.</t1241> <t1242>Now these songs are not sung in public, especially if they have words like liberated; they are considered too dangerous.</t1242> <t1243>They belong to the outlawed sects I feel so alone, little one,</t1243>
<t1244>I feel so lonely, little one,</t1244>
<t1245>I feel so lonely I could die.</t1245>
<t1246>This one is also banned.</t1246> <t1247>I remember it from an old cassette of my mother's; she also had a squeaky and unreliable device on which songs like this could still be heard.</t1247> <t1248>She used to play the cassette when her friends came over for drinks.</t1248>
<t1249>But I don't sing these songs often.</t1249> <t1250>They leave my throat sore.</t1250>
<t1251>In this house, there isn't much music, except for what we hear on the television.</t1251> <t1252>Sometimes Rita hums while she kneads or peels vegetables; it's a wordless, discordant, unfathomable hum. And sometimes, from the room in front, comes the faint sound of Serena's voice from a record recorded a long time ago, played at a low volume so she won't be caught listening while she knits and remembers her former and now amputated glory: Hallelujah.</t1252>
<t1253>It's hot for the time of year we're in.</t1253> <t1254>Houses like this one heat up with the sun, they are not sufficiently insulated.</t1254> <t1255>The air seems stagnant, despite the slight breeze, the breath that passes through the curtains.</t1255> <t1256>I would like to be able to open the window wide.</t1256> <t1257>Soon they will let us wear summer dresses.</t1257>
<t1258>The summer dresses are out of the suitcase, hanging in the closet; two of them are pure cotton, which are better than the synthetic fabric ones, cheaper; but even so, during July and August, when it's sweltering, you sweat a lot.</t1258> <t1259>Not to mention the tan, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t1259> <t1260>Women used to put on a show.</t1260> <t1261>They would slather themselves with oil as if they were a piece of meat for the grill, and they would walk down the street showing their backs and shoulders, and legs, because they didn't even wear stockings; no wonder those things happened.</t1261> <t1262>Things was the word she used when what happened was too unpleasant, obscene, or horrible to be uttered by her lips.</t1262> <t1263>For her, a fortunate life was one that avoided things, one that excluded things.</t1263> <t1264>Such things do not happen to decent women.</t1264> <t1265>And</t1265>
<t1266>it is not good for the skin at all, it leaves you wrinkled like an old apple.</t1266>
<t1267>But I forgot that we could no longer take care of our skin.</t1267>
<t1268>Sometimes, in the park, Aunt Lydia said, they would lie down on a blanket, men and women together; at this point, she would start to cry, and stand in front of us.</t1268>
<t1269>I do everything I can, he said.</t1269> <t1270>I try to give you the best possible chance.</t1270>
<t1271>She blinked, the light was too strong for her; her mouth trembled around her front teeth, which protruded a bit and were long and yellowish; they made me think of the mouse we found dead on the threshold, when the three of us lived in a house, four if you counted the cat, which was the one that made these kinds of offerings.</t1271>
<t1272>Aunt Lydia pressed her hand against her dead rodent-like mouth.</t1272> <t1273>After a minute, she moved it away.</t1273> <t1274>I also wanted to cry because it reminded me of him.</t1274> <t1275>If only he hadn't eaten half of it, I told Luke.</t1275>
<t1276>Don't think it's easy for me, Aunt Lydia said.</t1276>
<t1277>Moira carelessly entered my room and dropped the denim jacket on the floor.</t1277>
<t1278>Do you have a cigarette?, he asked me.</t1278>
<t1279>In the bag, I told her.</t1279> <t1280>But I don't have matches.</t1280>
<t1281>Moira rummages through my bag.</t1281> <t1282>You should throw away all this junk, she comments.</t1282> <t1283>I'm going to throw an underwear party.</t1283>
<t1284>About what?, I exclaimed.</t1284> <t1285>It's useless to try to work, Moira won't let you, she's like a cat that walks across the page when you're trying to read.</t1285>
<t1286>You know, like in Tupperware, only with lingerie; slut style: lace in the crotch, garters with snap fasteners.</t1286> <t1287>And those bras that lift your tits.</t1287> <t1288>Finds the lighter and lights the cigarette that he took from my purse.</t1288> <t1289>Do you want one?</t1289> <t1290>He throws me the pack, with great generosity considering it's mine.</t1290>
<t1291>A thousand thanks, I say to her ironically.</t1291> <t1292>You're crazy.</t1292> <t1293>Where did you come up with such an idea?</t1293>
<t1294>In the job I do to pay for my studies, he explains.</t1294> <t1295>I have connections.</t1295> <t1296>A friend of my mother's.</t1296> <t1297>The thing about the suburbs is fantastic, one figures that once they start discovering the places of young people, they will have beaten the competition.</t1297>
<t1298>The stores, who knows what else.</t1298>
<t1299>I burst out laughing.</t1299> <t1300>She always made me laugh.</t1300>
<t1301>But here?, I ask him.</t1301> <t1302>Who is going to come? Who is interested?</t1302>
<t1303>It's never too early to learn, he declares.</t1303> <t1304>Come on, it will be fabulous.</t1304> <t1305>We'll laugh our heads off.</t1305>
<t1306>Did we live like that back then?</t1306> <t1307>But we led a normal life.</t1307> <t1308>Like almost everyone, most of the time.</t1308> <t1309>Everything that happens is normal.</t1309> <t1310>Even what is happening now is normal.</t1310>
<t1311>We lived, as was normal, paying no attention to anything.</t1311> <t1312>Paying no attention is not the same as ignoring; it takes effort.</t1312>
<t1313>Nothing changes instantly: in a bathtub where the water heats up gradually, one could die boiled before realizing it.</t1313> <t1314>Of course, there were news stories in the newspapers: bodies in ditches or in the forest, women beaten to death or mutilated, defiled, they used to say; but they were stories about other women, and the men who did such things were other men.</t1314> <t1315>None of them were known to us.</t1315> <t1316>The news stories seemed like dreams to us, nightmares dreamed by others.</t1316> <t1317>How horrible, we said, and it was, but it was horrible without being believable.</t1317> <t1318>They were too melodramatic, they had a dimension that was not the dimension of our lives.</t1318>
<t1319>We were the people who didn't appear in the newspapers.</t1319> <t1320>We lived in the spaces in between, in the margins of each issue.</t1320> <t1321>This gave us more freedom.</t1321>
<t1322>We lived between the lines of the news.</t1322>
<t1323>From the lower driveway comes the sound of a car starting up.</t1323> <t1324>This is a quiet area, there isn't much traffic, you can hear very clearly sounds like car engines, lawnmowers, the snip of pruning shears, a door slamming.</t1324> <t1325>A scream or a gunshot could be heard clearly, if someone made those noises here.</t1325> <t1326>Sometimes, in the distance, sirens can be heard.</t1326>
<t1327>I go to the window and settle into its seat, which is too narrow to be comfortable.</t1327> <t1328>There is a cushion, hard and small, with a petit-point cover on which —written in block letters and framed by a garland of lilies—</t1328>
<t1329>the word FAITH is read, in a faded blue, and the leaves of the lilies in a dull green.</t1329> <t1330>This cushion was once used somewhere else, and it was worn, but not so much as to throw it away.</t1330> <t1331>Somehow, it has been overlooked.</t1331>
<t1332>I can spend minutes, tens of minutes, scanning the letters with my gaze: FAITH.</t1332> <t1333>It's the only thing they've given me to read.</t1333> <t1334>If they caught me doing it, would they take it into account?</t1334> <t1335>It wasn't me who put the cushion here.</t1335>
<t1336>The engine starts and I lean forward, closing the curtain in front of my face, as if it were a veil.</t1336> <t1337>It is semi-transparent, so I can see through it.</t1337> <t1338>If I press my forehead against the glass and look down, I can see the back half of the Whirlwind.</t1338> <t1339>I don't see anyone, but after a moment I notice that Nick walks around to the back door of the car, opens it, and stands stiffly beside it.</t1339>
<t1340>Now he wears the cap properly, and the sleeves are down and buttoned.</t1340> <t1341>From the angle where I am, I can see his face.</t1341>
<t1342>Now the Commander appears.</t1342> <t1343>I only manage to see him for an instant, in profile, as he walks towards the car.</t1343> <t1344>He is not wearing a hat, so he is not going to any official event.</t1344> <t1345>He has gray hair.</t1345> <t1346>Silver, I should say to be polite.</t1346> <t1347>But I don't feel like being polite.</t1347> <t1348>The previous one was bald, so I suppose this one represents quite a progress.</t1348>
<t1349>If I could spit, or throw something, for example the cushion, maybe I could hit him.</t1349>
<t1350>Moira and I have paper bags filled with water.</t1350> <t1351>They called them water bombs.</t1351>
<t1352>We peeked out the window of my bedroom and threw the bombs at the boys who were below.</t1352> <t1353>It was Moira's idea.</t1353> <t1354>What were they trying to do?</t1354> <t1355>Climb up a ladder in search of something.</t1355> <t1356>Our underwear.</t1356>
<t1357>That dormitory had once been mixed; in one of the sinks on our floor, there were still urinals.</t1357> <t1358>But by the time I arrived, they had already put women and men back in their places.</t1358>
<t1359>The Commander stops, gets into the car, disappears, and Nick closes the door.</t1359>
<t1360>A moment later the car reverses, goes down the driveway, and exits onto the street, disappearing behind the hedge.</t1360>
<t1361>I have to feel hatred for this man.</t1361> <t1362>I know I have to feel it, but it's not what I really feel.</t1362> <t1363>What I feel is more complicated.</t1363> <t1364>I don't know what to call it.</t1364> <t1365>It's not love.</t1365>
<t1366>CHAPTER 11</t1366>
<t1367>Yesterday morning I went to the doctor.</t1367> <t1368>Accompanied by a Guardian, one of those who wear a red armband and take care of such matters.</t1368> <t1369>We traveled in a red car, he in the front and I in the back.</t1369> <t1370>My double did not accompany me; on these occasions, I am a solitary.</t1370>
<t1371>They take me to the doctor once a month to undergo various tests: urine analysis, hormone tests, biopsy to detect if there is cancer, blood tests; just like before, except now it is mandatory.</t1371>
<t1372>The doctor's office is in a modern office building.</t1372> <t1373>We go up in the elevator, silently, and the Guardian and I stand face to face; I see the back of his neck in the smoked mirror of the elevator.</t1373> <t1374>When we arrive at the office, I enter; he waits outside, in the lobby with the other Guardians and sits in one of the chairs installed for that purpose.</t1374>
<t1375>In the waiting room, there are other women, three of them dressed in red: this doctor is a specialist.</t1375> <t1376>We glance furtively at each other, evaluating the size of our respective bellies.</t1376> <t1377>Has any of us been lucky?</t1377> <t1378>The nurse records our names and the numbers of our passes in the Compudoc, to check if we are who we are supposed to be.</t1378> <t1379>He is a man of about forty years old, around six feet tall, with a scar running diagonally across his cheek; he is typing and his hands look too large in relation to the keyboard; he still carries the gun in its holster.</t1379>
<t1380>When they call me, I go into the inner room.</t1380> <t1381>It is white, and there is no striking detail in it, just like in the outer one, except for a screen —a piece of red cloth stretched over a frame— with an eye painted in gold and below it a snake coiled around a sword, in a vertical position, like a kind of handle.</t1381> <t1382>The snakes and the swords are remnants of the symbolism of past eras.</t1382>
<t1383>I fill the jar that they have left prepared for me in the bathroom, I take off my clothes behind the screen and leave them folded on the chair.</t1383> <t1384>When I finish undressing, I lie down on the stretcher, on the disposable paper sheet, cold and crunchy.</t1384> <t1385>I stretch the second sheet, the cloth one, over my body.</t1385> <t1386>At the level of my neck, there is a third sheet hanging from the ceiling.</t1386> <t1387>This one comes between the doctor and me so that he cannot see my face.</t1387> <t1388>He will only have to deal with a torso.</t1388>
<t1389>Once ready, I stretch out my hand and grope for the small lever that is to the right of the table; I pull it back.</t1389> <t1390>Somewhere else a bell rings, but I do not hear it.</t1390> <t1391>A minute later the door opens and the steps and breathing of someone entering can be heard.</t1391> <t1392>He must not speak to me unless it is absolutely necessary.</t1392> <t1393>But this doctor is very talkative.</t1393>
<t1394>—How are we doing? —he asks, using a speech tic from bygone times.</t1394> <t1395>He pulls back the sheet from my skin and a shiver runs through my body.</t1395> <t1396>A cold finger, covered in rubber and jelly, slides inside me, probing my interior.</t1396> <t1397>The finger withdraws, enters in a different direction, and then pulls back.</t1397>
<t1398>—Everything is fine —he comments, as if talking to himself—.</t1398> <t1399>Does anything hurt, darling?</t1399> <t1400>—He calls me darling.</t1400>
<t1401>—No —I respond.</t1401>
<t1402>Now it's the turn of my breasts, which are palpated in search of any abscess.</t1402>
<t1403>The breathing gets closer, I perceive the smell of smoke, of aftershave lotion.</t1403>
<t1404>Then the voice, very soft, close to my face: it is him, who moves the sheet.</t1404>
<t1405>—I could help you —he says, whispering.</t1405>
<t1406>—What? —I ask.</t1406>
<t1407>—Shhh —he warns me—.</t1407> <t1408>I could help you.</t1408> <t1409>I have helped others.</t1409>
<t1410>—Help me? —I say to him, in a voice as low as his—.</t1410> <t1411>How? —Does he know something, has he seen Luke, has he found him, can he bring him?</t1411>
<t1412>—What do you think? —he asks, still in a whisper.</t1412> <t1413>Is it his hand that is sliding down my leg?</t1413> <t1414>He is taking off the glove—.</t1414> <t1415>The door is locked.</t1415>
<t1416>No one can enter.</t1416> <t1417>None of them would ever know that it isn't theirs.</t1417>
<t1418>Lift the sheet.</t1418> <t1419>The lower part of his face is covered by the regulation white gauze mask.</t1419> <t1420>A pair of brown eyes, a nose, and a head of brown hair.</t1420> <t1421>He has his hand between my legs.</t1421>
<t1422>—Most of those guys can't do it anymore —he explains to me—.</t1422> <t1423>Or they are sterile.</t1423>
<t1424>I almost gasp: he has uttered the forbidden word: sterile.</t1424> <t1425>There is no longer anything like a sterile man, at least officially.</t1425> <t1426>There are only fertile women and sterile women, that's what the law says.</t1426>
<t1427>—Lots of women do it —he continues—.</t1427> <t1428>You want a baby, right?</t1428>
<t1429>—Yes —I admit.</t1429> <t1430>It is true, and I do not ask the reason because I already know it.</t1430> <t1431>Give me children, or I will die.</t1431> <t1432>This phrase has more than one meaning.</t1432>
<t1433>—You are about to —he adds—.</t1433> <t1434>Now is the moment.</t1434> <t1435>Today or tomorrow would be perfect,</t1435>
<t1436>Why waste the opportunity?</t1436> <t1437>It would only take a minute, darling —that's what he should call his wife; maybe he still does, but in reality, it's a generic term.</t1437>
<t1438>We are all affection.</t1438>
<t1439>Hesitation.</t1439> <t1440>He is offering himself to me, offering me his services, with some risk to himself.</t1440>
<t1441>—I hate seeing what they make you go through —he murmurs.</t1441> <t1442>His attitude is genuinely compassionate.</t1442> <t1443>And yet he enjoys this, with all his sympathy.</t1443> <t1444>His eyes are moist with compassion; his hand nervously and impatiently runs over my body.</t1444>
<t1445>—It's too dangerous —I argue—.</t1445> <t1446>No.</t1446> <t1447>I can't —this is punishable by death, although they have to catch you while you're doing it, and with two witnesses.</t1447> <t1448>What are the chances, is there a hidden microphone in the room, who is exactly on the other side of the door?</t1448>
<t1449>His hand stops.</t1449>
<t1450>—Think about it —he advises me—.</t1450> <t1451>I've seen your chart; you don't have much time left.</t1451>
<t1452>But it's about your life.</t1452>
<t1453>—Thank you —I say to him.</t1453> <t1454>I must not give him the impression that I am offended, but rather open to his suggestion.</t1454> <t1455>He withdraws his hand almost reluctantly, slowly; as far as he is concerned, the last word has not yet been spoken.</t1455> <t1456>He could falsify the evidence, report that I suffer from cancer, from infertility, have me sent to the Colonies with the Unwomen.</t1456> <t1457>None of this has been mentioned, but the knowledge of his power hangs in the air as he pats my thigh; then he moves back until he is behind the hanging sheet.</t1457>
<t1458>—Next month —he suggests.</t1458>
<t1459>I get dressed again behind the screen.</t1459> <t1460>My hands are trembling.</t1460> <t1461>Why am I scared?</t1461> <t1462>I haven't crossed any boundaries, I haven't given any hope, I haven't taken any risks, everything is safe.</t1462> <t1463>It's the decision that terrifies me.</t1463> <t1464>An escape, a salvation.</t1464>
<t1465>CHAPTER 12</t1465>
<t1466>The bathroom is next to the bedroom.</t1466> <t1467>It has wallpaper with little blue flowers, forget-me-nots, and matching curtains.</t1467> <t1468>There is a blue bath mat and, on the toilet lid, a blue faux leather cover.</t1468> <t1469>The only thing this bathroom is missing to be like the old ones is a doll whose skirt hides the extra roll of toilet paper.</t1469> <t1470>Apart from the fact that the mirror above the sink has been removed and replaced with a rectangle of tin, and that the door has no lock, and that there are no razors, of course.</t1470> <t1471>At first, there were incidents in the bathrooms: cuts, drownings.</t1471> <t1472>Before they removed all the microphones.</t1472>
<t1473>Cora sits in a chair, in the lobby, to watch that no one else enters.</t1473> <t1474>In a bathroom, in a bathtub, one is vulnerable, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t1474> <t1475>She didn't say to what.</t1475>
<t1476>The bath is a necessity, but also a luxury.</t1476> <t1477>The simple act of taking off my white cap and veil, the simple act of touching my own hair again, is a luxury.</t1477> <t1478>I have long and neglected hair.</t1478> <t1479>We must keep it long, but covered.</t1479> <t1480>Aunt Lydia used to say: Saint Paul claimed it should be kept that way, or shaved.</t1480> <t1481>And she would let out a laugh, a sort of neigh with her head thrown back, so typical of her, as if she had told a joke.</t1481>
<t1482>Cora has filled the bathtub, which steams like a bowl of soup.</t1482> <t1483>I take off the rest of my clothes, the surplice, the white shirt and petticoats, the red stockings, the loose cotton pants.</t1483> <t1484>Tights rot your crotch, Moira used to say.</t1484> <t1485>Aunt Lydia would never have used an expression like rot your crotch.</t1485>
<t1486>She used the word unhygienic.</t1486> <t1487>She wanted everything to be very hygienic.</t1487>
<t1488>My nakedness feels strange to me.</t1488> <t1489>My body seems outdated.</t1489> <t1490>Did I really wear a swimsuit to go to the beach?</t1490> <t1491>I did, without noticing it, among men, not caring that my legs, my arms, my thighs, and my back were exposed and someone might see them.</t1491> <t1492>Shameful, impudent.</t1492> <t1493>I avoid looking at my body, not so much because it is shameful or impudent, but because I don't want to see it.</t1493> <t1494>I don't want to look at something that determines me so absolutely.</t1494>
<t1495>I get into the water, lie down, and let myself float.</t1495> <t1496>The water is warm.</t1496> <t1497>I close my eyes and suddenly, without warning, she is with me; it must be the smell of the soap.</t1497>
<t1498>I press my face against the soft hair of his nape and smell him: baby powder, freshly bathed child’s skin, and shampoo, with a faint scent of pee in the background.</t1498> <t1499>This is the age he is when I am in the bathtub.</t1499> <t1500>He appears to me at different ages, which is why I know he is not a ghost.</t1500> <t1501>If he were, he would always be the same age.</t1501>
<t1502>Once, when she was eleven months old, just before she started walking, a woman stole her from the shopping cart.</t1502> <t1503>It was a Saturday, the day Luke and I did the weekly shopping, because we both worked.</t1503> <t1504>She was sitting in the child seat that shopping carts used to have, with holes for the legs.</t1504> <t1505>She was very happy; I turned my back, I think it was in the cat food section; Luke was at the butcher's at the other end of the store, out of sight.</t1505> <t1506>He liked to choose the meat we were going to eat during the week.</t1506> <t1507>He said that men needed more meat than women, that it wasn't a superstition and that he wasn't a fool, he had studied for a reason.</t1507> <t1508>There are differences, he said.</t1508> <t1509>He loved to repeat it, as if I were trying to prove otherwise.</t1509> <t1510>But in general, he said it when my mother was present.</t1510> <t1511>He loved to provoke her.</t1511>
<t1512>I heard that she started to cry.</t1512> <t1513>I turned around and saw that she was disappearing down the hallway, in the arms of a woman I had never seen before.</t1513> <t1514>I shouted and the woman stopped.</t1514> <t1515>She must have been about thirty-five years old.</t1515> <t1516>She was crying and saying that it was her baby, that the Lord had given it to her, that He had sent her a sign.</t1516> <t1517>I felt sorry for her.</t1517> <t1518>The store manager apologized, and they detained her until the police arrived.</t1518>
<t1519>She's simply crazy, said Luke.</t1519>
<t1520>At that moment, I believed it was an isolated incident.</t1520>
<t1521>Her image fades, I can't keep her here with me, she has already disappeared.</t1521> <t1522>Maybe I do think of her as a ghost, the ghost of a dead girl, a creature who died when she was five years old.</t1522> <t1523>I remember the photos I once had of the two of us, me holding her in my arms, in typical poses, enclosed in a frame and safe.</t1523> <t1524>From behind my closed eyes, I see myself as I am now, sitting next to an open drawer, or next to a trunk in the basement, where I keep the folded baby clothes and an envelope with a lock of hair from when she was two years old, light blonde in color.</t1524> <t1525>Then it darkened.</t1525>
<t1526>I no longer have those things, neither the clothes nor the hair.</t1526> <t1527>I wonder what happened to our belongings.</t1527> <t1528>Looted, thrown away, and torn apart.</t1528> <t1529>Confiscated.</t1529>
<t1530>I have learned to manage without a lot of things.</t1530> <t1531>If you have too many things, Aunt Lydia used to say, you cling too much to the material world and forget spiritual values.</t1531> <t1532>Blessed are the humble.</t1532> <t1533>She did not add anything about them inheriting the earth.</t1533>
<t1534>I remain lying down, with the water gently lapping against my body, next to an open drawer that doesn't exist, and I think of a girl who didn't die when she was five years old; who still exists, I hope, although not for me.</t1534> <t1535>Do I exist for her?</t1535> <t1536>Am I an image in the darkness in the deepest part of her mind?</t1536>
<t1537>They must have told him that I was dead.</t1537> <t1538>That is what they must have done.</t1538>
<t1539>Surely they thought that this way it would be easier for her to adapt.</t1539>
<t1540>She must be eight years old now.</t1540> <t1541>I have made up for the lost time, I know everything that has happened.</t1541> <t1542>They were right, it's easier to think that she is dead.</t1542> <t1543>That way I don't have to harbor hopes, nor make a futile effort.</t1543> <t1544>Why bang your head against the wall?, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t1544> <t1545>Sometimes she had a very graphic way of saying things.</t1545>
<t1546>—I don't have all day —says Cora, on the other side of the door.</t1546> <t1547>It's true, she doesn't have all day.</t1547> <t1548>She doesn't have all of anything.</t1548> <t1549>I must not steal her time.</t1549> <t1550>I soap myself, use the short-bristled brush and pumice stone to remove dead skin.</t1550> <t1551>These typically puritan accessories are provided to you.</t1551> <t1552>I would like to be absolutely clean, free of germs and bacteria, like the surface of the moon.</t1552>
<t1553>I won't be able to wash myself tonight, nor later, nor all day.</t1553> <t1554>They say it's harmful, so why take risks?</t1554>
<t1555>Now I can't help but see the small tattoo on my knee.</t1555> <t1556>Four fingers and an eye, an upside-down passport.</t1556> <t1557>It is supposed to serve as a guarantee that I will never disappear.</t1557> <t1558>I am too important, too special for that to happen.</t1558> <t1559>I belong to the national reserve.</t1559>
<t1560>I pull out the plug, dry myself off, and put on the red terry cloth robe.</t1560> <t1561>I leave the dress I wore today here, because Cora will pick it up to wash it.</t1561> <t1562>Once in the room, I get dressed again.</t1562> <t1563>The white cap is not necessary at this hour because I am not going out.</t1563> <t1564>In this house, everyone knows my face.</t1564> <t1565>However, the red veil still covers my damp hair and my head, which has not been shaved.</t1565> <t1566>Where did I see that movie of some women kneeling in the town square, held by some hands, with their hair falling out in strands?</t1566> <t1567>What had they done?</t1567> <t1568>It must have been a long time ago, because I can't remember it.</t1568>
<t1569>Cora brings me dinner on a covered tray.</t1569> <t1570>Before entering, she knocks on the door.</t1570> <t1571>I appreciate that detail.</t1571> <t1572>It means she thinks I deserve something of what we used to call privacy.</t1572>
<t1573>—Thank you —I say, taking the tray from her hands.</t1573> <t1574>She smiles at me, but turns away without responding.</t1574> <t1575>When we are alone, she is wary of me.</t1575>
<t1576>I place the tray on the small white-painted table and move the chair closer to it.</t1576> <t1577>I remove the cover from the tray.</t1577> <t1578>A chicken thigh, overcooked.</t1578> <t1579>It's better than raw, which is the other way she prepares it.</t1579> <t1580>Rita knows how to show her resentment.</t1580> <t1581>A baked potato, green beans, salad.</t1581> <t1582>For dessert, canned pears.</t1582> <t1583>It's a fairly good meal, but light.</t1583> <t1584>Healthy food.</t1584> <t1585>You must consume vitamins and minerals, Aunt Lydia said, in a prim tone.</t1585> <t1586>You must be strong.</t1586> <t1587>No coffee or tea, no alcohol.</t1587> <t1588>Studies have been conducted.</t1588> <t1589>There is a paper napkin, like in cafeterias.</t1589>
<t1590>I think about others, those who have nothing.</t1590> <t1591>This is the paradise of love, here I lead a pampered life, may the Lord make us truly capable of feeling gratitude, said Aunt Lydia, that is, grateful, and I start to eat my food.</t1591> <t1592>Tonight I am not hungry.</t1592> <t1593>I feel nauseous.</t1593> <t1594>But there is nowhere to put the food, no plant pots, and I am not going to try the sink.</t1594> <t1595>I am very nervous, that's what it is.</t1595> <t1596>What if I left it on the plate and asked Cora not to report it?</t1596> <t1597>I chew and swallow, chew and swallow, and I float as I start to sweat.</t1597> <t1598>The food reaches my stomach turned into a ball, a handful of dampened and squeezed cardboard.</t1598>
<t1599>Downstairs, in the dining room, they must have set the large mahogany table, with candles, a white tablecloth, silver cutlery, flowers, and wine served in glasses.</t1599> <t1600>You will hear the clinking of knives against porcelain, and a snap when she releases the fork with a barely audible sigh and leaves half of the food on the plate, untouched.</t1600> <t1601>She will probably say that she has no appetite.</t1601> <t1602>Perhaps she will say nothing.</t1602> <t1603>If she says something,</t1603>
<t1604>Does he make any comments?</t1604> <t1605>If he doesn't say anything, does he notice it?</t1605> <t1606>I wonder how he manages to get them to notice her.</t1606> <t1607>I suppose it must be difficult.</t1607>
<t1608>On the side of the plate, there is a portion of butter.</t1608> <t1609>I cut a corner of the paper napkin, wrap the butter in it, take it to the cupboard, and hide it in the toe of my right shoe —the spare pair— as I have done before.</t1609> <t1610>I crumple the rest of the napkin: surely, no one will bother to straighten it out to check if something is missing.</t1610> <t1611>I will use the butter tonight.</t1611> <t1612>It wouldn't be good if it smelled like butter now.</t1612>
<t1613>I wait.</t1613> <t1614>I compose myself.</t1614> <t1615>My persona is something I must compose, like one composes a sentence.</t1615> <t1616>What I must present is a crafted object, not something natural.</t1616>
<t1617>V</t1617>
<t1618>THE NAP</t1618>
<t1619>CHAPTER 13</t1619>
<t1620>There is plenty of time.</t1620> <t1621>This is one of the things I wasn't prepared for: the amount of empty time, the long parentheses of nothingness.</t1621> <t1622>Time as white noise.</t1622> <t1623>If only I could embroider, or knit, do something with my hands...</t1623> <t1624>I want a cigarette.</t1624> <t1625>I remember when I used to visit art galleries, going through the nineteenth century, and their obsession with harems.</t1625> <t1626>Lots of paintings of harems, fat women lounging on divans, with turbans on their heads or velvet headpieces, fanned with peacock feathers by a eunuch standing guard in the background.</t1626> <t1627>Studies of sedentary bodies, painted by men who had never been there.</t1627> <t1628>These paintings were supposed to be erotic, and they seemed so to me back then; but now I understand their true meaning: they depicted interrupted joy, a wait, objects that were not used.</t1628> <t1629>They were paintings that represented boredom.</t1629>
<t1630>But perhaps boredom is erotic, at least for men, when it comes from women.</t1630>
<t1631>I wait, washed, brushed, fed, like a pig that is given as a prize.</t1631>
<t1632>In the 1980s, they invented balls for pigs, and they gave them to the pigs that were fattened in pigsties.</t1632> <t1633>They were large and colorful balls, and the pigs would roll them around using their snouts.</t1633> <t1634>Pork sellers said that this improved muscle tone; the pigs were curious, they liked having something to think about.</t1634>
<t1635>I read that in Introduction to Psychology; that, and the chapter about the laboratory rats that administered electric shocks to themselves, just to do something.</t1635> <t1636>And</t1636>
<t1637>the one who spoke of the trained pigeons to peck at a bud that made a grain of corn appear.</t1637> <t1638>They were divided into three groups: the first picked a grain with each peck; the second, one every two pecks, and the third did it haphazardly.</t1638> <t1639>When the person in charge of the experiment took the grain away, the first group gave up immediately, and the second group a little later.</t1639> <t1640>The third group never gave up.</t1640> <t1641>They would have pecked themselves to death before giving up.</t1641> <t1642>Who knows what the cause was.</t1642>
<t1643>I would like to have one of those balls for pigs.</t1643>
<t1644>I lie down on the braided rug.</t1644> <t1645>You can always train yourself, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t1645> <t1646>Several sessions a day, while you're immersed in your daily routine.</t1646> <t1647>Arms at your sides, knees bent, you lift your pelvis and lower your spine.</t1647> <t1648>Now up, and again.</t1648> <t1649>You count to five and inhale, hold your breath and release it.</t1649> <t1650>We did it in what used to be the Home Economics room, now free of washing machines and dryers; in unison, lying on small Japanese mats, while a cassette of Les Sylphides played.</t1650> <t1651>That's what now echoes in my mind, as I go up, down, and breathe.</t1651> <t1652>Behind my closed eyes, ethereal dancers gracefully flit among the trees and flutter their legs like the wings of a caged bird.</t1652>
<t1653>In the afternoons we lay down in our beds, in the gym, for an hour: from three to four.</t1653> <t1654>They said it was a time for rest and meditation.</t1654> <t1655>Back then I believed they did it because they wanted to get rid of us for a while, to take a break from the classes, and I know that outside of service hours the Aunts would go to the teachers' room to have a cup of coffee, or what they called that, whatever it was.</t1655> <t1656>But now I think the rest was also a training.</t1656> <t1657>They were giving us the opportunity to get used to the empty hours.</t1657>
<t1658>A little nap, Aunt Lydia called it in her prim style.</t1658>
<t1659>The strange thing is that we needed to rest.</t1659> <t1660>Almost all of us were going to sleep.</t1660>
<t1661>We were tired most of the time</t1661>
<t1662>Of time.</t1662> <t1663>I suppose they gave us some kind of pills, or drugs, which they put in the food to keep us calm.</t1663> <t1664>Or maybe not.</t1664> <t1665>Maybe it was the place.</t1665>
<t1666>After the first impression, once you had adapted, it was better to remain in a lethargic state.</t1666> <t1667>You could tell yourself that you were saving strength.</t1667>
<t1668>When Moira arrived, I must have been there for three weeks.</t1668> <t1669>She entered the gym accompanied by two of the Aunts, as usual, at nap time.</t1669> <t1670>She was still wearing her clothes —jeans and a blue tracksuit— and had short hair —to defy fashion, as usual—, which is why I recognized her immediately.</t1670> <t1671>She saw me, but turned away: she already knew what was most prudent.</t1671> <t1672>She had a purple bruise on her left cheek.</t1672> <t1673>The Aunts took her to an empty bed, where the red dress was already prepared.</t1673> <t1674>She undressed and started dressing again, in silence, while the Aunts stood at one end of the bed and we watched her with barely open eyes.</t1674> <t1675>When she turned, I saw the protrusions of her spine.</t1675>
<t1676>I couldn't talk to her for several days; we only exchanged brief glances, as a test.</t1676> <t1677>Friendship was suspicious, we knew it, so we avoided each other during meal times, in the cafeteria lines, and in the hallways, between classes.</t1677> <t1678>But on the fourth day, she was by my side during the walk we took two by two around the football field.</t1678> <t1679>Until we graduated, we weren't given the white cap, and we only wore the veil, so we could talk, with the precaution of speaking in a low voice and not turning our heads to look at each other.</t1679> <t1680>The Aunts walked at the beginning and end of the line, so the only danger was the others.</t1680> <t1681>Some were believers and could report us.</t1681>
<t1682>This is a madhouse, stated Moira.</t1682>
<t1683>I am so happy to see you..., I told him.</t1683>
<t1684>Where can we talk?, he asked me.</t1684>
<t1685>In the bathrooms, I replied.</t1685> <t1686>Watch the clock.</t1686> <t1687>The last stall, at two-thirty.</t1687>
<t1688>It was everything we said.</t1688>
<t1689>The fact that Moira is here makes me feel safer.</t1689> <t1690>We can go to the bathroom as long as we raise our hand, because there is a maximum number of times per day, and they record it on a chart.</t1690> <t1691>I look at the clock, electric and round, which is in front, above the green chalkboard.</t1691> <t1692>When it strikes two-thirty, we are in Testimony session.</t1692> <t1693>Aunt Helena is here, in addition to Aunt Lydia, because the Testimony session is something special.</t1693> <t1694>Aunt Helena is fat; once, in Iowa, she led a campaign to obtain Weight Watchers licenses.</t1694> <t1695>She is good at Testimony sessions.</t1695>
<t1696>It's Janine's turn, who recounts how at fourteen she was raped by a gang and had an abortion.</t1696> <t1697>Last week she told the same story, and she seemed almost proud of it.</t1697> <t1698>It might not even be true.</t1698> <t1699>In Testimony sessions, it's safer to make something up than to say you have nothing to reveal.</t1699> <t1700>Although in Janine's case, it's probably more or less true.</t1700>
<t1701>But whose fault was it? asks Aunt Helena while raising a chubby finger.</t1701>
<t1702>The fault is yours, yours, yours, we sang in unison.</t1702>
<t1703>Who dragged her into that?</t1703> <t1704>Aunt Helena smiles, satisfied with us.</t1704>
<t1705>It was her, her, her.</t1705>
<t1706>Why did God allow such an atrocity to happen?</t1706>
<t1707>To teach him a lesson.</t1707> <t1708>To teach him a lesson.</t1708> <t1709>To teach him a lesson.</t1709>
<t1710>Last week, Janine burst into tears.</t1710> <t1711>Aunt Helena made her kneel at the front of the class, with her hands behind her back, so that we could all see her red face and her runny nose.</t1711> <t1712>And her straw-blonde hair, her eyelashes so light it seemed like she didn't have any, as if they had been burned off in a fire.</t1712> <t1713>Burned eyes.</t1713> <t1714>She looked upset: weak, annoyed, dirty, and pink like a newborn mouse.</t1714> <t1715>None of us would ever want to look like that.</t1715> <t1716>For a moment, even though we knew what they were going to do to her, we despised her.</t1716>
<t1717>Llorona.</t1717> <t1718>Llorona.</t1718> <t1719>Llorona.</t1719>
<t1720>And the worst part is that we meant it.</t1720>
<t1721>I used to have a good opinion of myself.</t1721> <t1722>But at that moment, I didn't.</t1722>
<t1723>That happened last week.</t1723> <t1724>This week, Janine doesn't wait for us to insult her.</t1724>
<t1725>It was my fault, he says.</t1725> <t1726>Only mine.</t1726> <t1727>I incited them.</t1727> <t1728>I deserved the suffering.</t1728>
<t1729>Very good, Janine, says Aunt Lydia.</t1729> <t1730>You have set the example.</t1730>
<t1731>Before raising my hand, I have to wait for this to end.</t1731> <t1732>Sometimes, if you ask for permission at an inappropriate moment, they say no.</t1732> <t1733>And if you really have to go, it can be terrible.</t1733> <t1734>Yesterday, Dolores wet the floor.</t1734> <t1735>Two Aunts took her away, grabbing her by the armpits.</t1735> <t1736>She didn't appear for the afternoon walk, but at night she got back into her bed.</t1736> <t1737>We heard her complaining all night long.</t1737>
<t1738>What did they do to him?, was the murmur that ran from bed to bed.</t1738>
<t1739>I don't know.</t1739>
<t1740>And the fact of not knowing makes it even worse.</t1740>
<t1741>I raise my hand and Aunt Lydia nods.</t1741> <t1742>I stand up and walk out into the hallway, trying not to draw attention.</t1742> <t1743>Aunt Elizabeth stands guard outside the bathroom.</t1743> <t1744>She nods, indicating that I can go in.</t1744>
<t1745>This washroom was for the boys.</t1745> <t1746>Here too, they have replaced the mirrors with rectangles of opaque gray metal, but the urinals are still there, against one of the walls, and the white enamel is stained yellow.</t1746> <t1747>Strangely, they look like baby coffins.</t1747> <t1748>I am once again amazed by the nakedness that characterizes men's lives: the open showers, the body exposed to glances and comparisons, the private parts exposed in public.</t1748> <t1749>For what purpose?</t1749> <t1750>Does it have some reassuring purpose?</t1750> <t1751>The ostentation of a common badge among all of them, which makes them think that everything is in order, that they are where they should be.</t1751> <t1752>Why do women not need to prove to each other that they are women?</t1752> <t1753>A certain way of unbuttoning, of carelessly opening the crotch.</t1753> <t1754>A canine attitude.</t1754>
<t1755>The school is old, the toilets are made of wood, a type of particleboard.</t1755> <t1756>I enter the second one starting from the end, making the door swing.</t1756> <t1757>Of course, there are no locks anymore.</t1757> <t1758>At the back of the wood, near the wall and at waist height, there is a small hole, a reminder of vandalism from other times, or the legacy of a voyeur.</t1758> <t1759>In the Center, we all know about the existence of this hole; all except the Aunts.</t1759>
<t1760>I am afraid I may have arrived too late because of Janine's Testimony: perhaps Moira has already been here, perhaps she had to leave.</t1760> <t1761>They don't give you much time.</t1761>
<t1762>I carefully look under the wall of the toilet, and I see a pair of red shoes.</t1762> <t1763>But how can I know who they belong to?</t1763>
<t1764>I bring my mouth close to the hole.</t1764>
<t1765>Moira?, I whisper.</t1765>
<t1766>Is that you? he asks me.</t1766>
<t1767>Yes, I tell him.</t1767> <t1768>I feel an enormous relief.</t1768>
<t1769>My God, I need a cigarette, Moira comments.</t1769>
<t1770>I also respond.</t1770>
<t1771>I feel ridiculously happy.</t1771>
<t1772>I submerge myself in my body like in a swamp where only I know how to keep my balance.</t1772> <t1773>It is a shifting terrain, my territory.</t1773> <t1774>I become the ground on which I press my ear to listen to the whispers of the future.</t1774> <t1775>Every twinge, every murmur of slight pain, waves of detached matter, swellings and contractions of the tissue, secretions of the flesh: all these are signs, they are the things I need to know something about.</t1775> <t1776>Every month I await the blood with fear, because if it appears it represents a failure.</t1776> <t1777>Once again I have failed in the attempt to meet the expectations of others, which have become my own.</t1777>
<t1778>I used to think of my body as an instrument of pleasure, or as a means of transportation, or a tool for executing my will.</t1778> <t1779>I could use it to run, press buttons of one kind or another, and make things happen.</t1779> <t1780>There were limits, but nevertheless my body was agile, loose, solid, it formed a unity with me.</t1780>
<t1781>Now the body manages itself in a different way.</t1781> <t1782>I am a cloud solidified around a central object, pear-shaped, which is evident and more real than I am and shines in all its redness within its translucent envelope.</t1782> <t1783>Inside there is an immense space, dark and curved like the night sky, but red instead of black.</t1783> <t1784>Mined with tiny lights that shine, twinkle, and flicker inside.</t1784> <t1785>Every month a gigantic moon appears, round and deep like an omen.</t1785>
<t1786>It culminates, stops, continues, and hides from view, and I feel that despair takes hold of me like a ravenous hunger.</t1786> <t1787>Feeling that emptiness over and over again.</t1787> <t1788>I hear my heart, wave after wave, salty and red, incessantly, marking the time.</t1788>
<t1789>I am in the bedroom of our first apartment.</t1789> <t1790>I am standing in front of the wooden folding door closet.</t1790> <t1791>I know that everything around me is empty, the furniture is gone, the floors are bare, there isn't even a carpet; but despite this, the closet is full of clothes.</t1791> <t1792>I think they are my clothes, although they don't seem like it, I have never seen them.</t1792> <t1793>Maybe they are the clothes of Luke's wife, whom I have also never seen; only some photos and her voice on the phone one night when she called us yelling and accusing us, before the divorce.</t1793> <t1794>But no, they are my clothes.</t1794>
<t1795>I need a dress, I need something to wear.</t1795> <t1796>I take out dresses, black, blue, purple, jackets, skirts; none of them work for me, they don't even fit me well, they are either too big or too small.</t1796>
<t1797>Luke is behind me and I turn around to look at him.</t1797> <t1798>He doesn't look at me; he looks at the floor, where the cat is cleaning its paws and meowing plaintively over and over again.</t1798> <t1799>It wants food, but how can there be food in such an empty apartment?</t1799>
<t1800>Luke, I say.</t1800> <t1801>He doesn't respond.</t1801> <t1802>Maybe he doesn't hear me.</t1802> <t1803>It occurs to me that perhaps he isn't alive.</t1803>
<t1804>I'm running with her, holding her hand, pulling her, dragging her through the ferns, she's barely awake because of the pill I gave her so she wouldn't scream or say anything that could give us away, she doesn't know where she is.</t1804> <t1805>The ground is uneven, there are stones, dry branches, the smell of wet earth, old leaves, she can run very fast, I could run faster alone, I'm a good runner.</t1805> <t1806>Now she's crying, she's scared, I want to carry her but she would be too heavy for me.</t1806> <t1807>I'm wearing hiking boots and I think that when we reach the water I'll have to take them off in one pull, and if it will be too cold, and if she will be able to swim there, and what will happen with the current, we didn't expect this.</t1807> <t1808>Quiet, I say angrily.</t1808> <t1809>I think she might drown, and the mere idea makes me slow down.</t1809> <t1810>I hear the shots behind us, not very loud, not like firecrackers but sharp and clear like the crack of a dry branch.</t1810> <t1811>They sound wrong, things never sound like you think they should, and I hear a voice shouting Get Down, is it a real voice or a voice sounding inside my head, or am I the one saying it out loud?</t1811>
<t1812>I throw her to the ground and lie on top of her to cover and protect her.</t1812><t1813>Silence, I say to her again; my face is wet with sweat or tears, I feel serene and floating, as if I were no longer inside my body; near my eyes, there is a red leaf that has fallen prematurely, and I can see all its bright veins.</t1813><t1814>It is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.</t1814><t1815>I lessen the pressure, I don't want to suffocate her; I curl up over her, without taking my hand off her mouth.</t1815><t1816>I hear the breathing, and the pounding of my heart as if knocking on the door of a house at night, thinking that I would be safe there.</t1816><t1817>Everything is fine, I am here, I whisper to her, Please, stay quiet, but will she manage?</t1817><t1818>She is very small, it is already too late, we separate, they hold me by the arms, everything goes dark and there is nothing left except a small window, very small, like the far end of a telescope, like the little window of an old Christmas postcard, outside all night and ice, inside a candle, a tree with lights, a family, I even hear the chimes, they are the bells of a sleigh and old music on the radio, but through this window I can see her —small but very clear— moving away from me among the trees that have already turned red and yellow, reaching out to me as they take her away.</t1818>
<t1819>The chime wakes me up; and then Cora, who knocks on my door.</t1819> <t1820>I sit on the carpet and dry my face with my sleeve.</t1820> <t1821>Of all the dreams I've had, this one is the worst.</t1821>
<t1822>VI</t1822>
<t1823>THE FAMILY</t1823>
<t1824>CHAPTER 14</t1824>
<t1825>When the bell stops ringing, I go down the stairs: in the glass eye hanging on the wall downstairs, a tiny lost animal descends with me.</t1825> <t1826>The ticking of the clock sounds in time with the pendulum; my feet, shod in neat red shoes, follow the rhythm down the stairs.</t1826>
<t1827>The door to the living room is wide open.</t1827> <t1828>I enter: for the moment there is no one else.</t1828> <t1829>I do not sit, but I take my place, on my knees, near the chair and the footstool on which Serena Joy will soon be enthroned, leaning on her cane as she sits.</t1829> <t1830>She will probably lean on my shoulder to keep her balance, as if I were a piece of furniture.</t1830> <t1831>She has done it before.</t1831>
<t1832>Perhaps in other times, the room was called a parlor, and later a living room.</t1832> <t1833>Or</t1833>
<t1834>perhaps it is a reception room, one of those that have chandeliers and flies.</t1834> <t1835>But now, officially, it is a sitting room because that is what they do here, at least some of them.</t1835> <t1836>For others, it is just a standing room.</t1836> <t1837>Body posture is important: minor discomforts are instructive.</t1837>
<t1838>The room is dim and symmetrical; this is one of the forms that money takes when it freezes.</t1838> <t1839>Money has flowed through this room for years and years, as if traversing an underground cavern, encrusting and hardening like stalactites.</t1839> <t1840>The various surfaces present themselves mutely: the blackish pink velvet of the drawn curtains, the sheen of the matching eighteenth-century chairs, on the floor the cow's tongue peeking out from the Chinese tassel rug with its peach-colored peonies, the soft leather of the Commander's chair, and the glint of the brass box next to it.</t1840>
<t1841>The rug is authentic.</t1841> <t1842>In this room, there are some things that are authentic and others that are not.</t1842> <t1843>For example, two paintings, the portraits of two women, each on one side of the fireplace.</t1843> <t1844>Both are wearing dark dresses, like those in the church paintings, although from a later period.</t1844> <t1845>The paintings are probably authentic.</t1845> <t1846>I suppose that when Serena Joy acquired them —once it became obvious to her that she had to channel her energies in a convincingly domestic direction— she did so with the intention of pretending they were her ancestors.</t1846> <t1847>Or maybe they were in the house when the Commander bought it.</t1847> <t1848>There is no way to know.</t1848> <t1849>In any case, there they are hanging, with their straight backs and rigid mouths, oppressed chests, tense faces, stiff headdresses, grayish skin, watching the room with narrowed eyes.</t1849>
<t1850>Between them, on the mantelpiece, there is an oval mirror flanked by two pairs of silver candlesticks, and in the middle of these, a white porcelain Cupid with its arms around the neck of a lamb.</t1850> <t1851>Serena Joy's tastes are a strange mix: exquisite luxury or easy sentimentality.</t1851> <t1852>At each end of the fireplace, there is an arrangement of dried flowers, and on the polished marquetry table next to the sofa, a vase with natural daffodils.</t1852>
<t1853>The room is permeated with the smell of lemon oil, heavy fabrics, withered daffodils, the odors that linger after cooking —and that have seeped in from the kitchen or dining room— and the perfume of Serena Joy: Lily of the Valley.</t1853> <t1854>The perfume is a luxury, she must have a secret supplier.</t1854> <t1855>I inhale, thinking I might recognize it.</t1855> <t1856>It is one of those scents used by girls who have not yet reached adolescence, or that children give to their mothers for Mother's Day; the smell of socks and white cotton petticoats, of cleaning powders, of the innocence of the female body still free of hair and blood.</t1856> <t1857>This makes me feel slightly sick, as if I were locked in a car on a sweltering day with an older woman who used too much face powder.</t1857> <t1858>That is what the living room feels like, despite its elegance.</t1858>
<t1859>I would like to steal something from this room.</t1859> <t1860>I would like to take some small object —the scrollwork ashtray, maybe the little silver pillbox on the shelf, or a dried flower— and hide it within the folds of my dress or in the pocket of my sleeve, until night, and then hide it in my room, under the bed or in a shoe, or in a tear of the FAITH cushion.</t1860> <t1861>From time to time, I would take it out to look at it.</t1861> <t1862>It would give me the feeling that I have power.</t1862>
<t1863>But such a sensation would be illusory, and too risky.</t1863> <t1864>I leave my hands where they are, crossed over my lap.</t1864> <t1865>Thighs together, heels pressed under my body, pressing it.</t1865> <t1866>Head bowed.</t1866> <t1867>I have the taste of toothpaste in my mouth: a substitute of mint and chalk.</t1867>
<t1868>I wait for the family to gather.</t1868> <t1869>A family: that is what we are.</t1869> <t1870>The Commander is the head of the family.</t1870> <t1871>He feeds us all, like a nurse would.</t1871>
<t1872>A mothership.</t1872> <t1873>Every man for himself.</t1873>
<t1874>First, Cora enters, followed by Rita, drying her hands on the apron.</t1874> <t1875>They also come to the bell's call, reluctantly, because they have other things to do, like washing the dishes.</t1875> <t1876>But they have to be here.</t1876> <t1877>Everyone has to be here; the Ceremony demands it.</t1877> <t1878>We are obligated to stay until the end.</t1878>
<t1879>Rita looks at me with a frown and stands behind me.</t1879> <t1880>That she wastes time is my fault.</t1880> <t1881>Not mine, but my body's, if there is any difference.</t1881>
<t1882>Even the Commander is subject to the whims of his body.</t1882>
<t1883>Nick enters, greets the three of us with a nod, and looks around.</t1883> <t1884>He also positions himself behind me, standing.</t1884> <t1885>He is so close that he touches my foot with the tip of his shoe.</t1885> <t1886>Is he doing it on purpose?</t1886> <t1887>Whatever the case, we are touching.</t1887>
<t1888>I feel that my shoe softens, that the blood flows inside it, warms up, and transforms into a skin.</t1888> <t1889>I slightly move my foot aside.</t1889>
<t1890>—I hope he hurries up —comments Cora.</t1890>
<t1891>—Hurry up and wait —jokes Nick and laughs.</t1891> <t1892>He moves his foot in such a way that it touches mine again.</t1892> <t1893>Nobody can see what is under my spread-out skirt.</t1893> <t1894>I move, it's too hot here, the smell of stale perfume makes me feel sick.</t1894>
<t1895>I move my foot away.</t1895>
<t1896>We hear Serena's footsteps as she descends the stairs and approaches down the hallway, the sharp tap of her cane on the carpet and the dull thud of her healthy foot.</t1896>
<t1897>He limps through the door and gives us a look, as if counting us, but without seeing us.</t1897> <t1898>He nods at Nick, but says nothing.</t1898> <t1899>He is wearing one of his best dresses, light blue in color, with a white trim on the edges of the veil: flowers and patterns.</t1899> <t1900>Even at his age, he experiences the desire to adorn himself with flowers.</t1900>
<t1901>It's useless for you to do it, I tell him mentally, without moving a single muscle in my face, you can't use them anymore, you have withered.</t1901> <t1902>Flowers are the genital organs of plants; I read it somewhere once.</t1902>
<t1903>He advances to the chair and the footstool, turns, lowers himself, and lets his body drop clumsily.</t1903>
<t1904>He lifts his left foot onto the footstool and rummages in the pocket of his sleeve.</t1904> <t1905>I hear the rustle, then the click of his lighter, I perceive the smell of smoke and inhale deeply.</t1905>
<t1906>—Late, as usual —he says.</t1906> <t1907>We do not respond.</t1907> <t1908>He fumbles for the table lamp and turns it on; a click is heard and the television starts to work.</t1908>
<t1909>A chorus of men with yellowish-green skin —the color needs its adaptation—</t1909>
<t1910>sings "Come to the Church of the Virgin Forest."</t1910> <t1911>Come, come, come, come, sing the basses.</t1911> <t1912>Serena presses the channel selector.</t1912> <t1913>Waves, colorful zigzags, and a fading sound: it's the Montreal satellite station, which has been blocked.</t1913> <t1914>Then a pastor appears, serious, with bright dark eyes, addressing us from behind a desk.</t1914> <t1915>These days, pastors look a lot like businessmen.</t1915> <t1916>Serena gives him a few seconds and continues searching.</t1916>
<t1917>She flips through several blank channels, and finally, the news comes on.</t1917> <t1918>This is what she was looking for.</t1918> <t1919>She leans back and takes a deep breath.</t1919> <t1920>I, on the other hand, lean forward, like a child who has been allowed to stay up late with the adults.</t1920> <t1921>This is the good thing about these evenings, the Ceremony evenings: they allow me to listen to the news.</t1921> <t1922>It's as if there is an unspoken rule in this house: we always arrive on time, he always arrives late, and Serena always lets us watch the news.</t1922>
<t1923>As things are, who knows if any of this is true?</t1923> <t1924>They could be ancient fragments, or a forgery.</t1924> <t1925>But I listen to them anyway, hoping to read between the lines.</t1925> <t1926>Now, any news —whatever it may be— is better than none.</t1926>
<t1927>First, the front line.</t1927> <t1928>In reality, there is no front line: the war seems to be unfolding simultaneously in several places.</t1928>
<t1929>Wooded hills seen from above, trees of a sickly yellow.</t1929> <t1930>If only she would adjust the color... "The Appalachian Mountains," says the voice off-screen, "where the Fourth Division of the Angels of the Apocalypse is evicting a Baptist guerrilla stronghold with smoke bombs, supported by the Twenty-Third Battalion of the Angels of Light."</t1930> <t1931>They show us two black helicopters, with silver wings painted on the sides.</t1931> <t1932>Below them, a group of trees explodes.</t1932>
<t1933>Now we see a close-up of a bearded and dirty prisoner, escorted by two Angels dressed in their neat black uniforms.</t1933> <t1934>The prisoner accepts the cigarette offered by one of the Angels, and clumsily puts it in his mouth with his hands tied.</t1934> <t1935>A brief crooked smile appears on his face.</t1935> <t1936>The announcer is saying something, but I can't hear it; I am looking into the eyes of that man, trying to decipher what he is thinking.</t1936> <t1937>He knows the camera is focusing on him: is the smile a sign of defiance or submission?</t1937> <t1938>Does he feel uncomfortable being captured by the camera?</t1938>
<t1939>They only show us the victories, never the defeats.</t1939> <t1940>Who is interested in bad news?</t1940>
<t1941>He is probably an actor.</t1941>
<t1942>Now the counselor appears.</t1942> <t1943>His attitude is kind, paternal; he looks at us intently from the screen; he has tanned skin, white hair, and eyes with a sincere gaze, surrounded by wise wrinkles: the ideal image we all have of a grandfather.</t1943> <t1944>His even-tempered smile suggests that what he tells us is for our own good.</t1944> <t1945>Things will get better very soon.</t1945> <t1946>I promise you.</t1946> <t1947>We will have peace.</t1947> <t1948>You must believe it.</t1948>
<t1949>Now you must go to sleep, like good children.</t1949>
<t1950>It tells us what we long to hear.</t1950> <t1951>And it is very convincing.</t1951>
<t1952>I fight against him.</t1952> <t1953>I tell myself that he is like an old movie star, with false teeth and a fictional face.</t1953> <t1954>At the same time, he exerts a certain influence over me, as if he were hypnotizing me.</t1954> <t1955>If it were true, if I could believe him...</t1955>
<t1956>Now he is explaining to us that a clandestine espionage network has been dismantled by a team of Eyes that was working with an infiltrated informant.</t1956> <t1957>The network was dedicated to clandestinely smuggling valuable national resources across the Canadian border.</t1957>
<t1958>“Five members of the heretical Quaker sect have been arrested,” he announces, smiling affably, “and more arrests are expected.”</t1958>
<t1959>Two Quakers, a man and a woman, appear on the screen.</t1959> <t1960>They seem terrified, but they try to maintain some dignity in front of the camera.</t1960> <t1961>The man has a large, dark mark on his forehead; the woman's veil has been torn off, and her hair falls over her face.</t1961> <t1962>Both are around fifty years old.</t1962>
<t1963>Now they show us an aerial view of a city.</t1963> <t1964>It used to be Detroit.</t1964> <t1965>Underneath the narrator's voice, the roar of artillery can be heard.</t1965> <t1966>Columns of smoke are drawn in the sky.</t1966>
<t1967>—The reestablishment of the Ham Boys continues as planned —</t1967>
<t1968>says the reassuring pink face from the screen—.</t1968> <t1969>This week, three thousand have arrived at National Homeland One, and there are another two thousand in transit.</t1969>
<t1970>How do they manage to transport so many people at once?</t1970> <t1971>By trains, by buses?</t1971> <t1972>They don't show us any pictures of this.</t1972> <t1973>The National Homeland One is in North Dakota.</t1973> <t1974>God knows what they are supposed to do once they arrive.</t1974> <t1975>Dedicate themselves to farming, theoretically.</t1975>
<t1976>Serena Joy is already tired of the news.</t1976> <t1977>She impatiently presses the button to change the channel, and a deep baritone appears, an old man whose cheeks look like dried udders.</t1977> <t1978>He is singing "Whisper of Hope."</t1978> <t1979>Serena turns off the television.</t1979>
<t1980>We wait.</t1980> <t1981>The ticking of the clock in the hallway can be heard, Serena lights another cigarette, I get into the car.</t1981> <t1982>It's a Saturday morning in September, we still have a car.</t1982> <t1983>Other people have had to sell theirs.</t1983> <t1984>My name is not Offred, I have another name, a name that no one mentions now because it is forbidden.</t1984> <t1985>I tell myself it doesn't matter, the name is like a phone number, it's only useful to others; but what I tell myself is not correct, and this does matter.</t1985>
<t1986>I keep this name as something secret, like a treasure that I will unearth someday.</t1986>
<t1987>I think of him as if he were buried.</t1987> <t1988>He is surrounded by an aura, like an amulet, like a spell that has survived an unimaginably distant past.</t1988> <t1989>At night I lie down in my single bed, close my eyes, and the name floats exactly there, behind my eyes, out of reach, glowing in the dark.</t1989>
<t1990>It is a Saturday morning in September, and I put on my shining name.</t1990>
<t1991>The girl who is now dead sits in the back seat, with her two favorite dolls, her plush rabbit, dirty from years and caresses.</t1991> <t1992>I know all the details.</t1992>
<t1993>They are sentimental details, but I can't help it.</t1993> <t1994>However, I must not think too much about the rabbit because I can't start crying here, on the Chinese mat, breathing the smoke that was in Serena's body.</t1994> <t1995>Not here, not now, I can do it later.</t1995>
<t1996>She believed we were going on an excursion, and in fact, in the back seat next to her, there was a basket with food, hard-boiled eggs, a thermos, and everything.</t1996> <t1997>We didn't want her to know where we were really going, we didn't want her to, if we were stopped, make the mistake of talking and revealing something.</t1997> <t1998>We didn't want the burden of our truth to weigh on her.</t1998>
<t1999>I was wearing hiking boots and she was wearing canvas shoes.</t1999> <t2000>The laces of her shoes had hearts drawn in red, purple, pink, and yellow.</t2000>
<t2001>It was hot for the time of year we were in, some leaves were already starting to fall.</t2001> <t2002>Luke was driving, I was beside him, the sun was shining, the sky was blue, the houses looked comfortable and normal, and each one faded into the past, crumbled in an instant as if it had never existed, because I would never see them again; at least that's what I thought then.</t2002>
<t2003>We are taking almost nothing with us; we don't want to give the impression that we are going somewhere far or permanently.</t2003> <t2004>The passports are fake, but they are guaranteed: they are worth what we paid for them.</t2004> <t2005>We couldn't pay for them with money, of course, nor put them on the Compubank account, but we used other things: some of my mother's jewelry, a stamp collection that Luke had inherited from his uncle.</t2005> <t2006>These kinds of things can be exchanged for money in other countries.</t2006> <t2007>When we reach the border, we will pretend that we are only going on a day trip; the fake visas are only valid for one day.</t2007> <t2008>Before that, I will give her a sleeping pill, so that when we cross, she will already be asleep.</t2008> <t2009>That way, she won't betray us.</t2009> <t2010>You can't expect a child to be convincing when lying.</t2010>
<t2011>I don't want her to get scared, nor to feel the fear that now grips my muscles, tenses my spine, leaves me so tight that I'm sure if someone touches me, I'll break.</t2011> <t2012>Every red traffic light is like an agony.</t2012> <t2013>We'll spend the night in a motel, or better yet, we'll sleep in the car, on the side of the road, and avoid the suspicious questions.</t2013> <t2014>We'll cross in the morning, we'll go over the bridge with complete calm, as if we were going to the supermarket.</t2014>
<t2015>We entered the toll-free highway, heading north, and drove with little traffic.</t2015> <t2016>Since the war started, gasoline is expensive and scarce.</t2016> <t2017>Once out of the city, we passed the first checkpoint.</t2017> <t2018>They only want to see the permit.</t2018> <t2019>Luke passes the test: the permit matches the passport; we had already thought of that.</t2019>
<t2020>Back on the road again, he grabs my hand tightly and looks at me.</t2020> <t2021>You're as white as a sheet, he says to me.</t2021>
<t2022>This is how I feel: white, crushed, thin.</t2022> <t2023>I feel transparent.</t2023>
<t2024>Surely you can see right through me.</t2024> <t2025>Even worse, how will I be able to support Luke and her if I am so crushed, so pale?</t2025> <t2026>I feel like I have no strength left; it will slip through my hands, as if I were made of smoke, or as if I were a mirage that fades before their eyes.</t2026> <t2027>Don't think like that, Moira would say.</t2027> <t2028>If you think it, you'll make it happen.</t2028>
<t2029>Cheer up, says Luke.</t2029> <t2030>He is driving too fast.</t2030> <t2031>The adrenaline level in his head has dropped.</t2031> <t2032>He is singing.</t2032> <t2033>Oh, what a beautiful day, he sings.</t2033>
<t2034>Even their singing worries me.</t2034> <t2035>We were warned that we should not appear too cheerful.</t2035>
<t2036>CHAPTER 15</t2036>
<t2037>The Commander knocks on the door.</t2037> <t2038>The call is mandatory: it is assumed that the room is Serena Joy's territory, and that he must ask for permission to enter.</t2038> <t2039>She likes to make him wait.</t2039> <t2040>It's an insignificant detail, but in this house, insignificant details are very important.</t2040> <t2041>However, tonight she doesn't even have time to do it because, before she can say a word, he has entered.</t2041> <t2042>Maybe he simply forgot the protocol, but perhaps he did it deliberately.</t2042> <t2043>Who knows what she told him while they were dining, sitting at the table inlaid with silver.</t2043> <t2044>Or what she didn't tell him.</t2044>
<t2045>The Commander is wearing a black uniform, which makes him look like a museum guard.</t2045> <t2046>Or a semi-retired man, cordial but cautious, who spends his time idly.</t2046> <t2047>But that is the first impression he gives.</t2047> <t2048>If you look closely, he resembles a Midwestern bank president, with his smooth, neatly brushed silver hair, his serious demeanor, and his slightly hunched back.</t2048> <t2049>And then there's his mustache, also silver, and his chin, a feature impossible to overlook.</t2049> <t2050>If you look further down from his chin, he resembles a vodka advertisement from one of those glossy magazines from the old days.</t2050>
<t2051>His manners are gentle, his hands large, with thick fingers and greedy thumbs, his eyes blue and reserved, falsely harmless.</t2051> <t2052>He gives us a glance, as if taking inventory: a woman in red kneeling, one in blue sitting, two in green standing, a lone man with a thin face at the back.</t2052> <t2053>He manages to appear puzzled, as if he cannot exactly remember how many of us there are.</t2053>
<t2054>As if we were something inherited, for example a Victorian organ, and he didn't know what to do with us.</t2054> <t2055>Nor what we are for.</t2055>
<t2056>She tilts her head in the direction of Serena Joy, who does not make a single sound.</t2056>
<t2057>He advances towards the large leather chair reserved for him, takes the key out of his pocket, and fumbles in the copper-plated box with a leather lid that is on the table next to the chair.</t2057> <t2058>He inserts the key, opens the box, and takes out a copy of the Bible with black covers and gold-edged pages.</t2058> <t2059>The Bible is kept under lock and key, as many people used to do with tea to prevent the servants from stealing it.</t2059> <t2060>It's an absurd stratagem: who knows what we would do with it if we ever got our hands on it?</t2060> <t2061>He can read it to us, but we cannot read it ourselves.</t2061> <t2062>We turn our heads in his direction, expectant: we are about to hear a bedtime story.</t2062>
<t2063>The Commander sits down and crosses his legs, while we watch him.</t2063> <t2064>The markers are in their place.</t2064> <t2065>He opens the book.</t2065> <t2066>He clears his throat, as if he feels uncomfortable.</t2066>
<t2067>—Could I have a little water? —he says, leaving the Question hanging in the air—.</t2067> <t2068>Please —he adds.</t2068>
<t2069>Behind my back, Rita or Cora—one of the two—leaves her spot in the family portrait and walks silently to the kitchen.</t2069> <t2070>The Commander waits, with his eyes downcast.</t2070> <t2071>He sighs; from the inner pocket of his jacket, he takes out a pair of gold-rimmed reading glasses and puts them on.</t2071> <t2072>Now he looks like a shoemaker from an old storybook.</t2072> <t2073>Will his disguises as a benevolent man never end?</t2073>
<t2074>We observe each of their gestures, each of their features.</t2074>
<t2075>A man observed by several women.</t2075> <t2076>He must feel something very strange.</t2076> <t2077>They watching him all the time and wondering, what will he do now?</t2077> <t2078>Backing away every time he moves, even if it's as harmless a movement as reaching for an ashtray.</t2078> <t2079>Judging him, thinking: he can't do it, he won't be good enough, he'll have to be good enough, and making this last statement as if he were an outdated or poor-quality garment that must be worn anyway because there's nothing else.</t2079>
<t2080>They put it on, try it on, while he, in turn, puts them on as one puts on a sock, fits them onto his own appendage, his sensitive spare thumb, his tentacle, his lurking slug eye that protrudes, expands, retracts, and folds back on itself when touched incorrectly, and grows again, enlarging slightly at the tip, advancing as if delving into the foliage, inside them, eager for visions.</t2080> <t2081>To reach the vision in this way, through this journey in the darkness that is composed of women, of a woman who can see in the dark while he blindly hunches forward.</t2081>
<t2082>She watches him from the inside.</t2082> <t2083>We all watch him.</t2083> <t2084>It is something we can really do, and not in vain: what would become of us if he broke down or died?</t2084> <t2085>It wouldn't surprise me if beneath his tough exterior there was a tender being hidden.</t2085> <t2086>But this is only wishful thinking.</t2086> <t2087>I've been watching him for some time and he hasn't shown any signs of softness.</t2087>
<t2088>But be careful, Commander, I tell him mentally.</t2088> <t2089>I don't lose sight of you.</t2089> <t2090>One false move and I'm a dead woman.</t2090>
<t2091>However, it must seem incredible to be a man like that. It must be fantastic.</t2091>
<t2092>It must be incredible.</t2092>
<t2093>It must be very quiet.</t2093>
<t2094>The water arrives, and the Commander drinks.</t2094>
<t2095>—Thank you —he says.</t2095>
<t2096>Cora returns to her place.</t2096>
<t2097>The Commander pauses and lowers his gaze to search for the page.</t2097> <t2098>He takes his time, as if unaware of our presence.</t2098> <t2099>It is like someone toying with a steak, sitting by the window of a restaurant, pretending not to see the eyes watching from the hungry darkness less than a meter away.</t2099> <t2100>We lean in a bit towards him, like iron filings reacting to his magnetism.</t2100> <t2101>He has something we do not have, he has the word.</t2101> <t2102>How we used to waste it in other times.</t2102>
<t2103>The Commander starts to read, but it seems like he does it reluctantly.</t2103> <t2104>He is not very good at reading.</t2104> <t2105>Maybe he is simply bored.</t2105>
<t2106>It is the usual story, the usual stories.</t2106> <t2107>God speaking to Adam.</t2107> <t2108>God speaking to Noah.</t2108> <t2109>Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.</t2109> <t2110>Then comes all that boring nonsense about Rachel and Leah that they drilled into us at the Center.</t2110> <t2111>Give me children, or I shall die.</t2111> <t2112>Am I, instead of God, who prevents you from bearing fruit from your womb?</t2112> <t2113>Here is my maid Bilhah.</t2113> <t2114>She will bear children on my knees, and I too will have children through her.</t2114>
<t2115>Et cetera, et cetera.</t2115> <t2116>They read it to us every day during breakfast, when we sat in the school cafeteria eating oatmeal with cream and brown sugar.</t2116> <t2117>You have everything the best, Aunt Lydia would say.</t2117> <t2118>We are at war and things are rationed.</t2118> <t2119>You are spoiled girls, she continued, as if scolding a kitten.</t2119> <t2120>Naughty kitten.</t2120>
<t2121>During lunch, it was the beatitudes.</t2121> <t2122>Blessed this, blessed that.</t2122> <t2123>They played a record, sung by a man.</t2123> <t2124>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</t2124> <t2125>Blessed are the meek.</t2125>
<t2126>Blessed are the silent ones.</t2126> <t2127>I knew that they made it up, that it wasn't like that, and also that they omitted words, but there was no way to verify it.</t2127>
<t2128>Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</t2128>
<t2129>Nobody said when.</t2129>
<t2130>While we eat dessert —canned pears with cinnamon, the usual for lunch—, I look at the clock and search for Moira, who is sitting two tables away.</t2130> <t2131>She has already left.</t2131> <t2132>I raise my hand to ask for permission.</t2132> <t2133>We don't do it very often, and we always choose different times of the day.</t2133>
<t2134>Once in the bathrooms, I go into the second-to-last stall, as usual.</t2134>
<t2135>Are you there?, I whisper.</t2135>
<t2136>Moira answers me in person.</t2136>
<t2137>Have you heard anything?, I ask him.</t2137>
<t2138>Not much.</t2138> <t2139>I have to get out of here, or I'll go crazy.</t2139> <t2140>I feel panic.</t2140> <t2141>No, Moira, I tell her, don't try it.</t2141> <t2142>And even less so alone.</t2142>
<t2143>I will pretend to be sick.</t2143> <t2144>They send an ambulance, I've already seen it.</t2144>
<t2145>At most, you will reach the hospital.</t2145>
<t2146>At least it will be a change.</t2146> <t2147>I won't have to listen to that old witch.</t2147>
<t2148>They will discover you.</t2148>
<t2149>Don't worry, I'm really good at it.</t2149> <t2150>When I was in high school, I stopped taking vitamin C and got scurvy.</t2150> <t2151>At first, they couldn't diagnose it.</t2151> <t2152>Then you start taking vitamins again, and you get better.</t2152>
<t2153>I will hide my vitamins.</t2153>
<t2154>Moira, don't do it.</t2154>
<t2155>I couldn't bear the thought of not having her with me, for myself.</t2155>
<t2156>They send you with two guys in the ambulance.</t2156> <t2157>Think about it carefully.</t2157> <t2158>Those guys are starving, shit, they aren't even allowed to put their hands in their pockets, there's a possibility of...</t2158>
<t2159>Hey, you, your time is up, said Aunt Elizabeth's voice from the other side of the door.</t2159> <t2160>I got up and flushed the toilet.</t2160> <t2161>Two of Moira's fingers appeared through the hole in the wall.</t2161> <t2162>It was just the right size for two fingers.</t2162> <t2163>I brought my fingers close to hers and grabbed them quickly.</t2163> <t2164>Then I let them go.</t2164>
<t2165>—And Leah said: God has rewarded me because I have given my servant to my husband —says the Commander.</t2165> <t2166>He lets the book fall, which produces a muffled noise, like a padded door closing by itself, at a certain distance: a gust of air.</t2166> <t2167>The sound suggests the softness of the thin onion-skin pages, and the feel against the fingers.</t2167> <t2168>Soft and dry, like papier poudre, worn and dusty, old, the kind they gave you with propaganda pamphlets in the stores where they sold candles and soap of different shapes: seashells, mushrooms.</t2168> <t2169>Like cigarette paper.</t2169>
<t2170>Like petals.</t2170>
<t2171>The Commander remains with his eyes closed, as if he were tired.</t2171>
<t2172>He works many hours.</t2172> <t2173>Many responsibilities fall on him.</t2173>
<t2174>Serena has burst into tears.</t2174> <t2175>I can hear her, behind my back.</t2175> <t2176>It's not the first time.</t2176> <t2177>She does it every night the Ceremony is held.</t2177> <t2178>She tries not to make noise.</t2178> <t2179>She tries to maintain her dignity in front of us.</t2179> <t2180>The upholstery and the rugs muffle the sound, but despite that, we can hear her clearly.</t2180> <t2181>The tension that exists between her lack of control and her attempt to overcome it is horrible.</t2181> <t2182>It's like farting in church.</t2182> <t2183>As always, I feel an overwhelming need to burst out laughing, but not because I think it's funny.</t2183> <t2184>The smell of her crying spreads over all of us, and we pretend to ignore it.</t2184>
<t2185>The Commander opens his eyes, realizes, frowns, and ignores it.</t2185>
<t2186>—Let us pray in silence for a moment —says the Commander—.</t2186> <t2187>Let us ask for blessing and success in all our endeavors.</t2187>
<t2188>I lower my head and close my eyes.</t2188> <t2189>I hear behind me the held breath, the almost inaudible gasps, the shudders.</t2189> <t2190>How he must hate me, I think.</t2190>
<t2191>I pray in silence: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t2191> <t2192>I don't know what it means, but it sounds good and besides, it will have to do because I don't know what else I can say to God.</t2192> <t2193>At least I don't know right now.</t2193> <t2194>Or, as they used to say before, at this juncture.</t2194> <t2195>Before my eyes floats the phrase engraved on the wall of my closet, written by an unknown woman with Moira's face.</t2195> <t2196>I saw her leave towards the ambulance, on top of a stretcher carried by two Angels.</t2196>
<t2197>What's wrong with her? I asked the woman next to me in a very low voice; a fairly prudent question for anyone, except for a fanatic.</t2197>
<t2198>Fever, he said, barely moving his lips.</t2198> <t2199>Appendicitis, they say.</t2199>
<t2200>That evening I was having meatballs and minced meat for dinner.</t2200> <t2201>My table was next to the window and I could see what was happening outside, at the main entrance.</t2201> <t2202>I saw that the ambulance was coming back, this time without sounding the siren.</t2202> <t2203>One of the Angels jumped out and spoke to the guard.</t2203> <t2204>The latter entered the building; the ambulance remained parked and the Angel waited with his back to us, as he had been taught.</t2204> <t2205>Two Aunts came out of the building, with the guard, and walked towards the back of the ambulance.</t2205> <t2206>They took Moira out from inside, dragged her through the entrance and made her climb the steps, holding her by the armpits, one on each side.</t2206> <t2207>She couldn't walk.</t2207> <t2208>I left the food, I couldn't continue; at that moment, all of us who were sitting on that side of the table were looking out the window.</t2208> <t2209>The window was greenish, the same color as the chicken wire they used to put on the inside of the glass.</t2209> <t2210>Keep eating, said Aunt Lydia.</t2210> <t2211>She approached the window and lowered the blind.</t2211>
<t2212>They took her to a room that doubled as a Scientific Laboratory.</t2212>
<t2213>None of us entered there voluntarily.</t2213> <t2214>After that, she couldn't walk for a week; her feet were so swollen that they didn't fit in her shoes.</t2214> <t2215>For the first infraction, they focused on your feet.</t2215> <t2216>They used steel cables with frayed ends.</t2216> <t2217>Then it was the hands' turn.</t2217> <t2218>They didn't care what they did to your feet and hands, even if it caused irreversible damage.</t2218> <t2219>Remember this, Aunt Lydia said.</t2219> <t2220>Your feet and hands are not essential for our purposes.</t2220>
<t2221>Moira lying on the bed to serve as an example.</t2221> <t2222>She shouldn't have tried it, especially not with the Angels, said Alma from the next bed.</t2222> <t2223>We had to take her to the classes.</t2223> <t2224>In the cafeteria, at mealtime, we would steal the extra sugar packets and pass them along at night, bed to bed.</t2224> <t2225>She probably didn't need sugar, but it was the only thing we could steal.</t2225>
<t2226>To give it as a gift.</t2226>
<t2227>I keep praying, but what I see are Moira's feet just as they were when they brought her.</t2227> <t2228>They didn't look like feet.</t2228> <t2229>They were like a pair of drowned feet, swollen and boneless, though by the color anyone would have sworn they were lungs.</t2229>
<t2230>Oh, God, I pray.</t2230> <t2231>Don't let the bastards grind you down.</t2231>
<t2232>Was this what you were thinking?</t2232>
<t2233>The Commander clears his throat.</t2233> <t2234>It is what he always does to let us know that, in his opinion, it is time to stop praying.</t2234>
<t2235>—May the eyes of the Lord roam the earth far and wide, and may His strength protect all those who give Him their hearts —he concludes.</t2235>
<t2236>It is the farewell phrase.</t2236> <t2237>He gets up.</t2237> <t2238>We can leave.</t2238>
<t2239>CHAPTER 16</t2239>
<t2240>The Ceremony proceeds as usual.</t2240>
<t2241>I lie on my back, fully dressed except for the healthy white cotton underwear.</t2241> <t2242>If I opened my eyes, I would see the enormous white canopy of Serena Joy's bed —colonial style with four posts— suspended above our heads like a curved cloud, a cloud sprinkled with tiny drops of silver rain that, if you look closely, could become four-petaled flowers.</t2242> <t2243>I would not see the white carpet, nor the adorned curtains, nor the dresser with its set of mirror and silver-backed brush; only the canopy, which with its diaphanous fabric and pronounced downward curve suggests an ethereal yet material quality.</t2243>
<t2244>Or the sail of a ship.</t2244> <t2245>The swollen sails, they used to say, like a swollen belly.</t2245> <t2246>As if pushed by a belly.</t2246>
<t2247>We are engulfed by a mist of Lily of the Valley, cold, almost icy.</t2247> <t2248>This room is not warm at all.</t2248>
<t2249>Behind me, next to the headboard of the bed, is Serena Joy, stretched out and ready.</t2249>
<t2250>Her legs are spread, and between them, I find myself, with my head resting on her belly, the base of my skull on her pubis, and her thighs flanking my body.</t2250>
<t2251>She is also fully dressed.</t2251>
<t2252>I have my arms raised; she holds both of my hands with hers.</t2252> <t2253>It is supposed to mean that we are one flesh and one being.</t2253> <t2254>But the true meaning is that she controls the process and its product, if there is any.</t2254> <t2255>The rings on her left hand dig into my fingers, which could be revenge, or not.</t2255>
<t2256>I have the red skirt lifted, but only up to the waist.</t2256> <t2257>Underneath it, the Commander is fucking.</t2257> <t2258>What he is fucking is the lower part of my body.</t2258> <t2259>I don't say making love, because that's not what he's doing.</t2259> <t2260>Copulating wouldn't be an appropriate expression either, because it implies the participation of two people, and here only one is involved.</t2260> <t2261>But it's not rape either: nothing happens that I haven't accepted.</t2261> <t2262>There weren't many possibilities, but there were some, and this is the one I chose.</t2262>
<t2263>Therefore, I stay still and imagine the canopy above my head.</t2263>
<t2264>I remember the advice that Queen Victoria gave to her daughter: Close your eyes and think of England.</t2264> <t2265>But this is not England.</t2265> <t2266>I wish he would hurry.</t2266>
<t2267>Maybe I'm crazy, and this is a new form of therapy.</t2267>
<t2268>I wish it were true, because then I would get better and this would end.</t2268>
<t2269>Serena Joy squeezes my hands as if it were her —and not me— who is being fucked, as if she felt pleasure or pain, and the Commander keeps fucking with a regular rhythm, as if marking time, like a faucet that won't stop dripping.</t2269> <t2270>He is preoccupied, like a man who hums in the shower without realizing he's humming, as if he had other things on his mind.</t2270> <t2271>It's as if he were somewhere else, waiting for himself and drumming his fingers on the table while he waits.</t2271>
<t2272>Now his rhythm becomes somewhat impatient.</t2272> <t2273>Isn't being with two women at the same time every man's dream?</t2273> <t2274>That's what they said, they considered it exciting.</t2274>
<t2275>But what happens in this room, under Serena Joy's silver canopy, is not exciting.</t2275> <t2276>It has nothing to do with passion, nor love, nor romance, nor any of those ideas we used to stimulate ourselves with.</t2276> <t2277>It has nothing to do with sexual desire, at least not for me, and not for Serena either.</t2277> <t2278>Excitement and orgasm are no longer considered necessary; they would be a symptom of mere frivolity, like colored garters and fake beauty marks: superfluous distractions for empty minds.</t2278> <t2279>Something outdated.</t2279> <t2280>It's hard to believe that women used to waste so much time and energy reading about these kinds of things, thinking about them, worrying about them, writing about them.</t2280> <t2281>Evidently, they are nothing more than pastimes.</t2281>
<t2282>This is not a pastime, not even for the Commander.</t2282> <t2283>It is a serious matter.</t2283> <t2284>The Commander is also fulfilling his duty.</t2284>
<t2285>If I opened my eyes—even slightly—I could see him, I could see his not unpleasant face suspended over my torso, some strands of his silver hair perhaps falling over his forehead, absorbed in his inner journey, the place towards which he advances quickly and which, like in a dream, recedes at the same speed at which he approaches.</t2285> <t2286>I would see his open eyes.</t2286>
<t2287>If he were more handsome, would I enjoy it more?</t2287>
<t2288>At least it's an improvement over the first one, which smelled like a church wardrobe, just like your mouth when the dentist starts poking around in it, like a nose.</t2288> <t2289>The Commander, on the other hand, smells like mothballs, or is this smell a punitive form of aftershave?</t2289> <t2290>Why does he have to wear that stupid uniform?</t2290> <t2291>However, would I like his white, naked body more?</t2291>
<t2292>Among us, it is forbidden to kiss, which makes this more bearable.</t2292>
<t2293>You shut yourself in, you define yourself.</t2293>
<t2294>The Commander reaches the end letting out a muffled groan, as if he feels a certain relief.</t2294> <t2295>Serena Joy, who has been holding her breath, sighs.</t2295> <t2296>The Commander, who was leaning on his elbows and separated from our united bodies, does not allow himself to penetrate us.</t2296> <t2297>He rests for a moment, moves away, steps back, and zips up.</t2297> <t2298>He nods his head, then turns and leaves the room, closing the door with exaggerated caution, as if the two of us were his sick mother.</t2298> <t2299>There is something hilarious in all of this, but I do not dare to laugh.</t2299>
<t2300>Serena Joy lets go of my hands.</t2300>
<t2301>—You can get up now —he tells me—.</t2301> <t2302>Get up and leave.</t2302>
<t2303>It is supposed to let me rest for ten minutes with my feet on a cushion to increase the chances.</t2303> <t2304>For her, it should be a moment of meditation and silence, but she is not in the mood for it.</t2304> <t2305>In her voice, there is a hint of disgust, as if contact with my skin made her sick and contaminated her.</t2305> <t2306>I detach myself from her body and stand up; the Commander's juice drips down my legs.</t2306> <t2307>Before turning around, I see her adjusting her blue skirt and pressing her legs together; she remains lying on the bed, staring at the canopy, rigid and stiff like an effigy.</t2307>
<t2308>Which of the two is worse for, her or for me?</t2308>
<t2309>CHAPTER 17</t2309>
<t2310>This is what I do when I return to my room:</t2310>
<t2311>I take off my clothes and put on the nightgown.</t2311>
<t2312>I look for the ration of butter at the tip of my right shoe, where I hid it after dinner.</t2312> <t2313>The inside of the cupboard was too hot and the butter has become almost liquid.</t2313> <t2314>Most of it was absorbed by the napkin I used to wrap it.</t2314> <t2315>Now I'll have butter in my shoe.</t2315> <t2316>It's not the first time, it happens to me whenever I have butter, or even margarine.</t2316> <t2317>Tomorrow I'll clean the shoe lining with a wipe, or with a bit of toilet paper.</t2317>
<t2318>I rub my hands with butter and then rub my face.</t2318> <t2319>There is no more hand lotion or face cream, at least not for us.</t2319> <t2320>These things are considered a vanity.</t2320> <t2321>We are vessels; the only important thing is the inside of our bodies.</t2321> <t2322>The exterior can become hard and wrinkled like a walnut shell, and they don't care.</t2322> <t2323>The fact that there is no hand lotion is due to a decree from the Wives, who don't want us to be attractive.</t2323> <t2324>For them, things are bad enough as they are.</t2324>
<t2325>The thing with the butter is a trick I learned at the Raquel and Leah Center.</t2325> <t2326>We called it the Red Center, because almost everything was red.</t2326> <t2327>My predecessor in this room, my friend with freckles and a contagious laugh, must have also done this with the butter.</t2327> <t2328>We all do it.</t2328>
<t2329>As long as we do it, as long as we rub butter on our skin to keep it smooth, we can believe that one day we will be free from this, that we will be touched with love or desire again.</t2329> <t2330>We have our private ceremonies.</t2330>
<t2331>Butter is greasy, it will go rancid and I will smell like old cheese; but at least it's organic, as they used to say.</t2331>
<t2332>We have reached the point of having to resort to these stratagems.</t2332>
<t2333>Once buttered, I lie down on my single bed, flattened like a toast.</t2333> <t2334>I can't sleep.</t2334> <t2335>Wrapped in semi-darkness, I fix my gaze on the plaster eye of the ceiling, which also looks at me but cannot see me.</t2335> <t2336>Not even the slightest breeze blows, the white curtains are like loose gauze bandages, shining under the aura projected by the spotlight that illuminates the house at night,</t2336>
<t2337>Or is it the moon?</t2337>
<t2338>I pull back the sheet and cautiously get up; I go to the window, barefoot to avoid making noise, just like a shadow; I want to look.</t2338> <t2339>The sky is clear, although the glare from the spotlights doesn't allow a good view; but in it floats the moon, a yearning moon, the fragment of an ancient rock, a goddess, a glimmer.</t2339> <t2340>The moon is a stone and the sky is full of deadly weapons, but it is beautiful nonetheless.</t2340>
<t2341>I'm dying to have Luke by my side.</t2341> <t2342>I wish someone would hug me and say my name.</t2342> <t2343>I want to be valued in a way that no one does now, I want to be more than just valuable.</t2343> <t2344>I repeat my old name, I remind myself of what I used to do, and how others saw me.</t2344>
<t2345>I want to steal something.</t2345>
<t2346>The small hallway lamp is on, and in the spacious room, a soft pink light shines.</t2346> <t2347>I walk on the carpet, carefully placing one foot, then the other, trying not to make any noise, as if I were sneaking into a forest, and my heart beats rapidly as I advance through the darkness of the house.</t2347> <t2348>I shouldn't be here; this is completely illegal.</t2348>
<t2349>I pass by the fisheye mirror on the wall of the lobby and see my white figure, the hair cascading down my back like a waterfall, my bright eyes.</t2349> <t2350>I like it.</t2350> <t2351>I do something on my own.</t2351> <t2352>In the present tense.</t2352> <t2353>I am present.</t2353> <t2354>What I would like to steal is a knife from the kitchen, but I am not prepared for that.</t2354>
<t2355>I arrive at the living room; the door is ajar, I enter and leave it slightly open again.</t2355> <t2356>The wood creaks, and I wonder if anyone heard it.</t2356> <t2357>I stop and wait for my pupils to dilate, like those of a cat or an owl.</t2357> <t2358>I smell old perfume and rags.</t2358> <t2359>Through the gaps in the curtains, the faint glow of the spotlights outside comes in, where surely two men are making their rounds; from above, from behind the curtains, I have seen their silhouetted, dark figures.</t2359> <t2360>Now I manage to see the contours of the objects as faint glimmers: the mirror, the feet of the lamps, the vases, the sofa that outlines itself like a cloud in the twilight.</t2360>
<t2361>What could I take?</t2361> <t2362>Something that no one would miss.</t2362> <t2363>A magical flower from a forest shrouded in darkness.</t2363> <t2364>A withered daffodil, not from the bouquet of dried flowers.</t2364> <t2365>They will have to throw away these daffodils very soon, because they are starting to smell, just like Serena's smoke and the stench of her fabric.</t2365>
<t2366>I advance by feeling my way, I find the edge of a table and touch it.</t2366> <t2367>A jingling sound is heard, I must have knocked something over.</t2367> <t2368>I find the daffodils, which have dry and crunchy edges and soft stems, and I cut one with my fingers.</t2368> <t2369>I will let it dry somewhere.</t2369> <t2370>Under the mattress.</t2370> <t2371>I will leave it there for the woman who comes after to find it.</t2371>
<t2372>There is someone else in the room.</t2372>
<t2373>I hear the footsteps, as stealthy as mine, and the creaking of the wood.</t2373> <t2374>The door closes behind me with a slight click, blocking the light.</t2374> <t2375>I am petrified.</t2375> <t2376>It was a mistake to come here dressed in white: I am like the snow in the moonlight, even in the darkness.</t2376>
<t2377>At last I hear a whisper:</t2377>
<t2378>—Don't shout.</t2378> <t2379>Everything is fine.</t2379>
<t2380>As if I were going to scream; as if everything were fine.</t2380> <t2381>I turn around: all I see is a silhouette and the dim reflection of a pale cheek.</t2381>
<t2382>Take a step towards me.</t2382> <t2383>It's Nick.</t2383>
<t2384>—What are you doing here?</t2384>
<t2385>I don't respond.</t2385> <t2386>He can't be here either, with me, so he won't turn me in.</t2386> <t2387>Nor will I turn him in; for now, we're even.</t2387> <t2388>He puts his hand on my arm and pulls me towards him, his mouth against mine, what else could happen?</t2388> <t2389>Without uttering a single word.</t2389> <t2390>Both of us shaking in Serena's room, with the dried flowers, on the Chinese rug, his thin body touching mine.</t2390> <t2391>A completely unknown man.</t2391> <t2392>It would be the same as shouting, like shooting someone.</t2392> <t2393>I slide my hand down, I could unbutton him, and then...</t2393> <t2394>But it's too dangerous, he knows it, and we separate a little.</t2394> <t2395>Too much trust, too much risk, too much haste.</t2395>
<t2396>—I came to find you —he tells me, almost whispering in my ear.</t2396> <t2397>I would like to stretch out and feel his skin; he awakens my desires.</t2397> <t2398>His fingers run along my arm under the sleeve of my nightgown, as if his hand didn't heed reason.</t2398> <t2399>It's so pleasant to be touched by someone, to feel desired, to desire.</t2399> <t2400>You would understand, Luke, it's you who is here, in someone else's body.</t2400>
<t2401>Shit.</t2401>
<t2402>—Why? —I ask.</t2402> <t2403>Is it so terrible for him that he risks coming to my room during the night?</t2403> <t2404>I think of the hanged men, the ones hanging on the Wall.</t2404> <t2405>I can barely stand it.</t2405> <t2406>I have to leave, run up the stairs before I completely disintegrate. Now he puts his hand on my shoulder, a hand that presses down on me, heavy as lead.</t2406> <t2407>Would I die for this?</t2407> <t2408>I am a coward, I can't bear the idea of pain.</t2408>
<t2409>—He told me —Nick explains to me—.</t2409> <t2410>He wants to see you, in his office.</t2410>
<t2411>—What do you mean? —I say to him.</t2411> <t2412>He must be referring to the Commander. See me? What does he mean see me? Hasn't he had enough?</t2412>
<t2413>—Tomorrow —adds Nick in an almost inaudible tone.</t2413>
<t2414>In the darkness of the room, we moved apart, slowly, as if a hidden current united us and at the same time separated us with equal force.</t2414>
<t2415>I find the door; I turn the knob feeling the cold porcelain on my fingers, and I open it.</t2415> <t2416>It is all I can do.</t2416>
<t2417>VII</t2417>
<t2418>THE NIGHT</t2418>
<t2419>CHAPTER 18</t2419>
<t2420>Still trembling, I lie down on the bed.</t2420> <t2421>If you moisten the rim of a glass and run a finger around it, a sound is produced.</t2421> <t2422>That's how I feel: like that sound.</t2422> <t2423>I feel shattered.</t2423> <t2424>I want to be with someone.</t2424>
<t2425>Lying in bed with Luke, his hand on my rounded belly.</t2425> <t2426>The three of us are in bed, she kicking and moving inside me.</t2426> <t2427>A storm has broken out outside, that's why she is awake, they can hear, they sleep, they can get scared even in the calm of that interior, like waves licking the shore that surrounds them.</t2427> <t2428>A fairly close lightning bolt makes Luke's eyes turn white for an instant.</t2428>
<t2429>I am not scared.</t2429> <t2430>We are completely awake, now the rain is hitting, we will do it slowly and carefully.</t2430>
<t2431>If I thought this would never happen again, I would die.</t2431>
<t2432>But it is false, no one dies from lack of sex.</t2432> <t2433>It is from lack of love that we die.</t2433> <t2434>There is no one here whom I can love, all the people I love are dead, or elsewhere.</t2434> <t2435>Who knows where they are or what their names might be now?</t2435> <t2436>They could also be nowhere, as I must be according to them.</t2436> <t2437>I am also a missing person.</t2437>
<t2438>From time to time I glimpse their faces in the darkness, flickering like images of saints in ancient foreign cathedrals, by the light of wavering candles; candles lit to pray on one's knees, with the forehead against the wooden railing, waiting for an answer.</t2438> <t2439>I can conjure them, but they are only mirages, they do not last.</t2439> <t2440>Can I be censured for desiring a real body to wrap my arms around?</t2440> <t2441>Without it, I too am incorporeal.</t2441> <t2442>I can hear my own heartbeat against the mattress springs, caress myself under the dry white sheets, in the darkness, but I too am dry, white, stony, grainy; it is as if I were sliding my hand over a plate of rice; like snow.</t2442> <t2443>In this, there is a certain dose of death, of abandonment.</t2443> <t2444>I am like a room where things once happened but where nothing happens anymore, except for the pollen from the grasses growing on the other side of the window, which spreads across the floor like dust.</t2444>
<t2445>This is what I believe.</t2445>
<t2446>I believe that Luke is lying face down in a thicket, a tangle of ferns, last year's branches beneath the barely developed green ones, perhaps of hemlock, although it's too early for the berries.</t2446> <t2447>What's left of him: his hair, his bones, the green and black plaid wool shirt, the leather belt, the boots.</t2447> <t2448>I know exactly what he was wearing.</t2448> <t2449>I see his clothes mentally, bright as a lithograph or a full-color advertisement from an old magazine, but I don't picture his face, not as clearly.</t2449> <t2450>It starts to fade, probably because it was never the same: his face had different expressions, and his clothes did not.</t2450>
<t2451>I beg that the hole, or the two or three —because there was more than one shot—</t2451>
<t2452>if they were very close together, I pray that at least one hole has opened cleanly, quickly, piercing the skull to the place where images are formed, so that there was a single flash of darkness or pain, I hope soft, like a dull noise, just one and then silence.</t2452>
<t2453>I believe so.</t2453>
<t2454>I also think that Luke is standing upright on a gray cement rectangle, somewhere, on the ledge or the edge of something, a bed or a chair.</t2454> <t2455>God knows what he's wearing.</t2455> <t2456>God knows what he has been subjected to.</t2456> <t2457>God is not the only one who knows, so maybe there will be a way to find out.</t2457> <t2458>He hasn't shaved in a year, although when they feel like it, they cut your hair, to avoid lice, they say.</t2458>
<t2459>I will have to think about it: if they cut his hair to avoid lice, they would also have to cut his beard.</t2459> <t2460>It would have to be considered.</t2460>
<t2461>Anyway, they don't do it well, the cut is sloppy, the nape is uneven, although that's not the worst; he looks ten years older, hunched over like an old man, bags under his eyes; on his cheeks, he has some burst veins, purple in color, and a scar, no, a wound that is still not healed, the color of tulips near the stem, on the left side of his face, where the flesh has just been torn.</t2461> <t2462>His body is very injured and battered, it's nothing more than water and chemicals, barely more than a jellyfish drying on the sand.</t2462>
<t2463>It is painful for him to move his hands, it hurts him to move.</t2463> <t2464>He doesn't know what he is being accused of.</t2464>
<t2465>It's a problem.</t2465> <t2466>There has to be something, some accusation.</t2466> <t2467>Otherwise, why are they holding him, why isn't he dead yet?</t2467> <t2468>He must know something they want to find out.</t2468> <t2469>I can't imagine it.</t2469> <t2470>I can't imagine that he hasn't said it, whatever it is.</t2470> <t2471>I would have done it.</t2471>
<t2472>He is surrounded by a smell, his smell, the smell of an animal locked in a dirty cage.</t2472> <t2473>I imagine him resting, because I can't bear to imagine him at any other time, just as I can't imagine him having anything under his neck, or on his wrists.</t2473> <t2474>I don't even want to think about what they've done to his body.</t2474> <t2475>Does he have shoes?</t2475> <t2476>No, and the floor is cold and damp.</t2476> <t2477>Does he know that I am here, alive, and that I am thinking about him?</t2477>
<t2478>I have to believe so.</t2478> <t2479>When you find yourself in a tight situation, you have to believe all kinds of things.</t2479> <t2480>Now I believe in telepathy, in ether vibrations, and in that kind of nonsense.</t2480> <t2481>I had never believed in them.</t2481>
<t2482>I also believe that they didn't catch him, that after all they didn't reach him, that he made it, that he got to the shore, swam across the river, crossed the border and crawled to the opposite shore, which was an island, and his teeth were chattering; he managed to reach a nearby farm and they let him in, initially with suspicion but later, when they understood who he was, they became friendly, they weren't the type of people who would turn him in; maybe they were Quakers and they smuggled him into the territory by passing him from house to house, and the woman made him a hot coffee and gave him a change of clothes from her husband.</t2482> <t2483>I imagine the clothes.</t2483> <t2484>It would comfort me to know that he was warm.</t2484>
<t2485>He came into contact with the others, there must be a resistance, a government in exile.</t2485> <t2486>There must be someone out there who takes care of things.</t2486> <t2487>I believe in the resistance in the same way that I believe there can't be light without shadow, or rather, there is no shadow unless there is also light.</t2487> <t2488>There has to be a resistance because otherwise, where do all the criminals that appear on television come from?</t2488>
<t2489>Any day now, a message from him could arrive.</t2489> <t2490>It will come in the most unexpected way, from the person you least imagine, someone you would never have suspected.</t2490> <t2491>Perhaps it will be under my plate, on the food tray?</t2491> <t2492>Or will it be slipped into my hand while I hand over the vouchers across the counter at Todo Carne?</t2492>
<t2493>The message will say that I must be patient: sooner or later he will rescue me, he will find her, wherever they have her.</t2493> <t2494>She will remember us, and the three of us will be together.</t2494>
<t2495>In the meantime, I must resist, keep myself safe for later.</t2495> <t2496>What has happened to me, what is happening to me now, will not matter to him, he loves me anyway, he knows it is not my fault.</t2496> <t2497>The message will also speak of that.</t2497> <t2498>It is this message —which may never arrive— that keeps me alive.</t2498> <t2499>I believe in the message.</t2499>
<t2500>The things I believe may not all be true, although some of them must be.</t2500> <t2501>But I believe in all of them, I believe in the three versions of what happened to Luke, in all three at the same time.</t2501> <t2502>This contradictory way of believing seems to me, at this moment, the only way I have to believe in something.</t2502> <t2503>Whatever the truth may be, I will be prepared.</t2503>
<t2504>This is also one of my beliefs.</t2504> <t2505>This can also be false.</t2505>
<t2506>One of the tombstones in the cemetery near the church has carved a casket and an hourglass, and the words: With hope.</t2506>
<t2507>With hope.</t2507> <t2508>Why did they dedicate those words to a dead person?</t2508> <t2509>Was it the corpse that harbored hopes, or those who are still alive?</t2509>
<t2510>Does Luke have hopes?</t2510>
<t2511>VIII</t2511>
<t2512>THE DAY OF BIRTH</t2512>
<t2513>CHAPTER 19</t2513>
<t2514>I am dreaming that I am awake.</t2514>
<t2515>I dream that I get out of bed and cross the room, not this room, and go out the door, not this door.</t2515> <t2516>I'm at home, one of my homes, and she runs to meet me dressed in her little green nightgown with a sunflower on the front, barefoot, and I pick her up and feel her arms and legs wrapping around my body and I start to cry because I realize that I'm not awake.</t2516> <t2517>I'm in this bed again, trying to wake up and I wake up and sit on the edge of the bed, and my mother comes with a tray and asks me if I feel better.</t2517> <t2518>As a child, when I got sick, she had to miss work.</t2518> <t2519>But this time I'm not awake either.</t2519>
<t2520>After these dreams, I wake up for real and I know that I am truly awake because I see the garland on the ceiling and my curtains, which hang like a soaked white mane.</t2520> <t2521>I feel drugged.</t2521> <t2522>I think that maybe they are drugging me.</t2522> <t2523>Maybe the life I believe I am living is a paranoid illusion.</t2523>
<t2524>Not a chance.</t2524> <t2525>I know where I am, who I am, and what day it is.</t2525> <t2526>These are the proofs, and I am healthy.</t2526> <t2527>Health is an invaluable asset.</t2527> <t2528>I treasure it just as people once treasured money.</t2528> <t2529>I keep it, because that way I'll have enough when the time comes.</t2529>
<t2530>A gray reflection enters through the window, a dull shine, there isn't much sun today.</t2530> <t2531>I get out of bed, go to the window, and kneel on the seat, on the hard cushion of FAITH, and look outside.</t2531> <t2532>There is nothing to see.</t2532>
<t2533>I wonder what happened to the other two cushions.</t2533> <t2534>There must have been three at some point.</t2534> <t2535>HOPE and CHARITY, where could they have stored them?</t2535> <t2536>Serena Joy is a woman of order.</t2536> <t2537>She wouldn't throw anything away unless it was very worn out.</t2537> <t2538>One for Rita and one for Cora?</t2538>
<t2539>The bell rings; I am already up, I got up before time.</t2539> <t2540>I get dressed, without looking down.</t2540>
<t2541>I sit in the chair and think about this word: chair.</t2541> <t2542>It also means papal seat, and there is the electric chair.</t2542> <t2543>In English, it is called chair, and chair in French means flesh. None of these things are related to the rest.</t2543>
<t2544>This is the kind of litany I resort to in order to calm myself.</t2544>
<t2545>In front of me, I have a tray, and on the tray, there is a glass of apple juice, a vitamin pill, a spoon, a plate with three slices of toast, a small dish with honey, and another plate with an egg cup — one of those that look like a woman's torso — covered with a lid.</t2545> <t2546>Under the lid, to keep it warm, is the second egg.</t2546> <t2547>The egg cup is made of white porcelain with a blue stripe.</t2547>
<t2548>The first egg is white.</t2548> <t2549>I move the egg carton a bit so that it is now under the pale sunlight coming through the window, which falls on the tray shining, weakening, and shining again.</t2549> <t2550>The eggshell is smooth and at the same time grainy.</t2550> <t2551>Under the sunlight, tiny calcium pebbles are drawn, like the craters of the moon.</t2551> <t2552>It is an arid, yet perfect landscape; it is the kind of desert that saints traversed so that abundance would not scatter their minds.</t2552> <t2553>I think this must be what God looks like: an egg.</t2553> <t2554>Perhaps life on the Moon does not take place on the surface but inside.</t2554>
<t2555>Now the egg glows, as if it had its own energy.</t2555> <t2556>Looking at it gives me intense pleasure.</t2556>
<t2557>The sun goes away and the egg fades.</t2557>
<t2558>I take the egg out of the egg carton and touch it.</t2558> <t2559>It is warm.</t2559> <t2560>Women used to carry eggs like these between their breasts to incubate them.</t2560> <t2561>It must have been a pleasant sensation.</t2561>
<t2562>The minimal expression of life.</t2562> <t2563>Pleasure condensed in an egg.</t2563> <t2564>Blessings that can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</t2564> <t2565>But that's probably how I'm expected to react.</t2565> <t2566>If I have an egg, what more could I want?</t2566>
<t2567>In a tight situation, the desire to live clings to strange objects.</t2567> <t2568>I would like to have a pet: let's say a bird, or a cat.</t2568> <t2569>A friend.</t2569>
<t2570>Anything that seemed familiar to me.</t2570> <t2571>Even a rat would do, if I ever caught one, but there's no chance: this house is too clean.</t2571>
<t2572>I break the top of the egg with the spoon and eat the inside.</t2572>
<t2573>While I eat the second egg, I hear the siren, at first very far away —</t2573>
<t2574>snaking towards me between the enormous houses with trimmed lawns, a high-pitched sound like the buzz of an insect, then approaching and opening up like the sound that blooms in a trumpet.</t2574> <t2575>This siren is quite a proclamation.</t2575> <t2576>I put down the spoon; my heart races and I move closer to the window: could it be blue, and not for me?</t2576> <t2577>I see it turn the corner, come down the street, and stop in front of the house without ceasing to sound the siren.</t2577> <t2578>It's red.</t2578> <t2579>The day dresses up for a celebration, something rare these days.</t2579> <t2580>I leave the second egg half-eaten and run to the closet to grab my cape; I can already hear the footsteps on the stairs and the voices.</t2580>
<t2581>—Hurry up —Cora urges me—, they won't wait for you all day —she helps me put on the cloak; she is smiling.</t2581>
<t2582>I advance through the hallway, almost running; the staircase is like a ski slope, the main door is wide, today I can go through it; next to it is the Guardian, who greets me.</t2582> <t2583>It has started to rain, it's only a drizzle, and the air is filled with the smell of earth and grass.</t2583>
<t2584>The red Birthmobile is parked in the driveway.</t2584> <t2585>The back door is open and I climb up through it.</t2585> <t2586>The carpet is red, just like the curtains on the windows.</t2586> <t2587>Inside, there are already three women, sitting on the benches installed along the sides of the van.</t2587> <t2588>The Guardian closes and locks the double door and jumps into the front seat, next to the driver; through the wire mesh that protects the glass, we can see the backs of their heads.</t2588> <t2589>We start with a jolt, while above our heads the siren screams: Make way, make way!</t2589>
<t2590>—Who is it? —I ask the woman next to me; I have to speak into her ear, or wherever her ear is under the white headdress.</t2590> <t2591>There is so much noise that I almost have to shout.</t2591>
<t2592>—Dewarren —she responds to me, shouting.</t2592> <t2593>As if moved by an impulse, she grabs my hand, squeezes it.</t2593> <t2594>As the van turns the corner, it swerves; the woman turns towards me and I can see her face and the tears running down her cheeks.</t2594> <t2595>Why is she crying?</t2595> <t2596>Is it envy or displeasure?</t2596> <t2597>But no, she is laughing, she throws her arms around my neck, I don't know her, she hugs me, I feel her large breasts under the red dress; she wipes her face with her sleeve.</t2597> <t2598>On a day like this, we can do whatever we want.</t2598>
<t2599>I correct myself: within certain limits.</t2599>
<t2600>In front of us, on the other bench, a woman prays with her eyes closed and covering her mouth with her hands.</t2600> <t2601>Maybe she is not praying, but biting her thumbnail.</t2601> <t2602>Perhaps she is trying to calm herself.</t2602> <t2603>The third woman has already calmed down.</t2603>
<t2604>She is sitting with her arms crossed and smiles slightly.</t2604> <t2605>The siren sounds continuously.</t2605>
<t2606>This was the sound of death, the one used by ambulances or firefighters.</t2606>
<t2607>Probably today it will also be the sound of death.</t2607> <t2608>We will know soon.</t2608> <t2609>What will Dewarren give birth to? A baby, as we all hope?</t2609> <t2610>Or something else, a Non-Baby, with a very small head, or a snout like a dog's, or two bodies, or a hole in the heart, or without arms, or with the fingers of the hands and feet joined by a membrane?</t2610> <t2611>It is impossible to know.</t2611> <t2612>It used to be detectable with devices, but now that is prohibited.</t2612> <t2613>Anyway, what would be the point of knowing?</t2613> <t2614>You can't get rid of it; whatever it is, you have to carry it inside until the term is fulfilled.</t2614>
<t2615>At the Center, they taught us that there is a one in four chance.</t2615> <t2616>At one time, the air became saturated with chemicals, rays, and radiation, and the water turned into a boiling pot of toxic molecules; it takes years to clean all of this thoroughly, and in the meantime, the pollution gradually enters your body and lodges in your adipose tissue.</t2616> <t2617>Who knows, your very flesh might be contaminated like a dirty beach, a sure death for coastal birds or gestating babies.</t2617> <t2618>If a vulture were to eat you, it might die.</t2618> <t2619>Perhaps you would glow in the dark like an old clock.</t2619> <t2620>Like a deathwatch beetle, which is also the name of a beetle that hides in carrion.</t2620>
<t2621>Sometimes I can't think of myself and see my skeleton in my body: I wonder what I must look like to an electron.</t2621> <t2622>A framework of life, made with bones; and inside, dangers, deformed proteins, crystals chipped like glass.</t2622> <t2623>Women took medications, pills, men sprayed the trees, cows ate grass, and all these urinations seeped into the rivers.</t2623> <t2624>Not to mention the explosion of nuclear plants on the San Andreas fault, the fault was no one's, during the earthquakes, nor the type of mutant syphilis that broke all molds.</t2624> <t2625>Some managed on their own, closed their wounds with catgut or healed them with chemicals.</t2625> <t2626>How could they?, said Aunt Lydia, oh,</t2626>
<t2627>How could they do that? Jezebels! Disdaining the gifts of God!</t2627> <t2628>And she wrung her hands.</t2628>
<t2629>It's a risk you take, Aunt Lydia said, but you are the shock troops, you will march at the forefront through dangerous territories.</t2629> <t2630>The greater the risk, the greater the glory.</t2630> <t2631>She clasped her hands, radiant with our false courage.</t2631>
<t2632>We stared at the desk.</t2632> <t2633>Going through all that and giving birth to a rag: it was not a pleasant thought.</t2633> <t2634>We didn't know exactly what happened to the babies who didn't pass the test and were declared Not Babies.</t2634> <t2635>But we knew they were taken somewhere and quickly gotten rid of.</t2635>
<t2636>There was no reason, says Aunt Lydia.</t2636> <t2637>She is standing in front of the class, with her khaki dress and a pointer in her hand.</t2637> <t2638>On the blackboard, where there must have once been a map, they have displayed a chart showing the birth rate expressed in thousands, over several years: a marked decline that drops below the zero line and continues descending.</t2638>
<t2639>Of course, some women believed there would be no future; they thought the world would explode.</t2639> <t2640>That's the excuse they gave, says Aunt Lydia.</t2640> <t2641>They said there was no point in having offspring.</t2641> <t2642>Aunt Lydia's nostrils flared: such wickedness.</t2642>
<t2643>They were lazy, he said.</t2643> <t2644>Filthy pigs.</t2644>
<t2645>On the surface of my desk, there are some initials and dates engraved.</t2645> <t2646>The initials sometimes come in pairs, connected by the word "loves."</t2646> <t2647>J. H. loves B. P., 1954; O. R. loves L. T.</t2647> <t2648>They remind me of the inscriptions I used to see engraved on the stone walls of caves, or drawn with a mixture of soot and animal fat.</t2648> <t2649>They seem incredibly ancient to me.</t2649> <t2650>The surface of the desk is made of light wood, slanted, and has an arm on the right side where one can rest to write with paper and pen.</t2650>
<t2651>Inside the desk, you can store things: books and notebooks.</t2651> <t2652>These customs from other times now seem luxurious to me, almost decadent; immoral, like the orgies of barbarian regimes.</t2652> <t2653>M. loves G., 1972.</t2653> <t2654>This engraving, made by repeatedly pressing a pencil into the worn varnish of the desk, has the pathos of all extinct civilizations.</t2654> <t2655>It's like engraving something by hand on a stone.</t2655>
<t2656>Whoever did it was once alive.</t2656>
<t2657>There are no dates later than the 1980s.</t2657> <t2658>This must have been one of the schools that closed permanently due to a lack of children.</t2658>
<t2659>They made mistakes, says Aunt Lydia.</t2659> <t2660>We don't want to repeat them.</t2660> <t2661>Her voice is pious, condescending; it is the voice of a person whose function is to tell us unpleasant things for our own good.</t2661> <t2662>I would like to strangle her.</t2662> <t2663>I push the idea out of my mind as soon as it occurs to me.</t2663>
<t2664>Things are valued, he says, only when they are rare and difficult to obtain.</t2664>
<t2665>We want to be appreciated girls.</t2665> <t2666>She is fertile in making pauses and savors them slowly.</t2666> <t2667>Imagine that you are pearls.</t2667> <t2668>We, sitting in a row, with our gaze lowered, make her salivate morally.</t2668> <t2669>We are hers and she can define us, we must endure her adjectives.</t2669>
<t2670>I think about the pearls.</t2670> <t2671>Pearls are frozen oyster spit.</t2671> <t2672>Later I will tell Moira; if I can.</t2672>
<t2673>We are all going to get you up to speed, says Aunt Lydia, with joy and satisfaction.</t2673>
<t2674>The van stops, the rear doors open, and the Guardian makes us get out as if we were a herd.</t2674>
<t2675>Next to the front door there is another Guardian, with one of those recoilless machine guns slung over his shoulder.</t2675> <t2676>We march in a line towards the front door, under the drizzle, and the Guardians salute us.</t2676> <t2677>The huge emergency van, the one that transports the equipment and the paramedics, is parked a little further away, in the driveway.</t2677> <t2678>I see that one of the paramedics is looking out the van window.</t2678> <t2679>I wonder what he is doing in there, waiting.</t2679> <t2680>Most likely he is playing cards, or reading; or engaged in some male pastime.</t2680> <t2681>Most of the time they are not needed at all; they are only allowed in when their presence is unavoidable.</t2681>
<t2682>Before it was different, they took care of it.</t2682> <t2683>It was a shame, Aunt Lydia said.</t2683>
<t2684>Shameful.</t2684> <t2685>The only thing he showed us was a movie shot in an old hospital: a pregnant woman, connected to a device, with electrodes coming out from everywhere, giving her the appearance of a broken robot, and a probe in her arm feeding her intravenously.</t2685> <t2686>A man with a reflector looks between her legs —</t2686>
<t2687>where they have shaved her, leaving her really like a beardless child—; a tray with bright sterilized scalpels can be seen; everyone has their face covered by a mask.</t2687> <t2688>A cooperative patient.</t2688> <t2689>Once they have drugged her and induced labor, they make an incision and sew her up.</t2689> <t2690>That's all.</t2690> <t2691>They don't even use anesthesia.</t2691> <t2692>Aunt Elizabeth said it was better for the baby, and that: I will greatly increase your pain in childbirth: you will give birth in pain.</t2692> <t2693>They gave it to us during lunch, in a sandwich of brown bread and lettuce.</t2693>
<t2694>As I climb the staircase, a wide staircase with a stone vase on each side</t2694>
<t2695>—the Commander of Dewarren must have a higher social position than ours—, I hear another siren.</t2695> <t2696>It's the blue Birthmobile, the one for the Wives.</t2696> <t2697>This must be Serena Joy, making her triumphant entrance.</t2697> <t2698>They don't have to sit on benches, but on real, upholstered seats.</t2698> <t2699>They can look forward and don't have the curtains closed.</t2699> <t2700>They know where they are going.</t2700>
<t2701>Serena Joy has probably been in this house before, having tea.</t2701> <t2702>Maybe Dewarren, formerly the crying little whore Janine, paraded in front of her and the other Wives so they could see her belly, maybe touch it, and congratulate the Wife.</t2702> <t2703>A strong girl, with good muscles.</t2703> <t2704>No Agent Orange in her family, we checked the records, no precaution is excessive.</t2704> <t2705>And maybe some kind phrase: Would you like a cookie, dear?</t2705>
<t2706>Oh, no, it would harm them, it's not good for them to eat too much sugar.</t2706>
<t2707>One won't hurt you, just one, Mildred.</t2707>
<t2708>And the brown-noser Janine: Oh, yes, can I have one, ma'am?</t2708> <t2709>Please.</t2709>
<t2710>What an exemplary one, so well-behaved, not sullen like some others, she does her job and that's all.</t2710> <t2711>Like a daughter to you, as you would say.</t2711> <t2712>One of the family.</t2712> <t2713>A matron's stifled giggle.</t2713> <t2714>That's all, dear, you can go back to your room.</t2714>
<t2715>And when she has gone:</t2715> <t2716>They are all little whores, but at least you can't complain.</t2716> <t2717>You take what they give you, right, girls?</t2717> <t2718>That's what the Commander's Wife would say.</t2718>
<t2719>Oh, but you have been very fortunate.</t2719> <t2720>Wow, some of them aren't even clean.</t2720> <t2721>And they would never smile at you, they lock themselves in their room, they don't wash their hair, and what a smell.</t2721> <t2722>I have to send the Marthas to clean, I almost have to drag her to the bathtub, I practically have to bribe her just to get her to take a bath, I have to threaten her.</t2722>
<t2723>I had to take severe measures with mine, and now she doesn't eat as she should; and as for the other thing, not a bit, even though we've been very regular.</t2723> <t2724>But yours is a complete guarantee for you.</t2724> <t2725>And any of these days, oh, you must be so nervous, she's so fat, aren't you impatient?</t2725>
<t2726>A little more tea?, discreetly changing the subject.</t2726>
<t2727>I already know what comes next.</t2727>
<t2728>And what is Janine doing in her room?</t2728> <t2729>She must be sitting, with the taste of sugar still in her mouth, licking her lips.</t2729> <t2730>Looking out the window.</t2730> <t2731>Inhaling and exhaling.</t2731>
<t2732>Caressing her swollen breasts.</t2732> <t2733>Without thinking about anything.</t2733>
<t2734>CHAPTER 20</t2734>
<t2735>The central staircase is wider than ours, and it has a curved railing on each side.</t2735> <t2736>From above, I hear the sing-song of the women who have already arrived.</t2736> <t2737>We go up the stairs in single file, very carefully, so as not to step on the hem of the dress of the one in front.</t2737> <t2738>To the left, you can see the double doors of the dining room —which are now folded back—, and inside, the long table covered with a white tablecloth and full of cold dishes: ham, cheese, oranges —they have oranges!—, freshly baked rolls.</t2738> <t2739>As for us, later they will serve us a tray with milk and sandwiches.</t2739> <t2740>But they have a coffee maker and bottles of wine because, can't the Wives get a little drunk on such a joyous day?</t2740> <t2741>First, they will wait for the results and then they will gorge themselves like pigs.</t2741> <t2742>Now they are gathered in the living room, on the other side of the staircase, cheering on the Wife of this Commander, Warren's wife.</t2742> <t2743>She is a petite woman; she is lying on the floor, dressed in a white cotton nightgown, and her gray hair spread out on the carpet like a damp stain; they are massaging her belly, as if she were really about to give birth.</t2743>
<t2744>The Commander, of course, is not in sight.</t2744> <t2745>He has gone where men go on these occasions, to some hiding place.</t2745> <t2746>He is probably calculating the moment when his presentation will be announced, if all goes well.</t2746> <t2747>Now he is sure he has succeeded.</t2747>
<t2748>Dewarren is in the main room, a good way to define it: that is where the Commander and his Wife lie down.</t2748> <t2749>She is sitting on the huge bed, propped up with cushions: it is Janine, swollen but diminished, stripped of her original name.</t2749> <t2750>She is wearing a straight white cotton dress, lifted above her thighs; her long brown hair is combed back and tied at the nape, so it doesn't get in the way.</t2750> <t2751>Her eyes are squeezed shut; seeing her like this, she almost seems pleasant to me.</t2751> <t2752>After all, she is one of us, what does she intend, if not to live as pleasantly as possible?</t2752> <t2753>What else does any of us want?</t2753> <t2754>The drawback lies in what is possible.</t2754> <t2755>Considering the circumstances, she is not doing badly.</t2755>
<t2756>She is flanked by two women I don't know who are holding her hands, or perhaps it is she who is holding the women's hands.</t2756> <t2757>A third woman lifts her nightgown, applies baby oil to the mound formed by her belly, and rubs it in a downward motion.</t2757> <t2758>At her feet is Aunt Elizabeth, dressed in the khaki outfit with chest pockets.</t2758> <t2759>She was one of those who taught Gynecological Education classes.</t2759> <t2760>I can only see one side of her head, her profile, but I know it's her because of her unmistakable prominent nose and her considerable and severe chin.</t2760>
<t2761>Next to it, you can see the birthing chair with its double seat, one of them raised like a throne behind the other.</t2761> <t2762>They will not place Janine in the chair until the time comes.</t2762>
<t2763>The sheets are ready, as well as the small bathtub and the bowl with ice cubes for Janine to suck on.</t2763>
<t2764>The other women are sitting on the carpet with their legs crossed; they form a crowd, it is supposed that all the women of the district are here.</t2764> <t2765>There must be twenty-five or thirty.</t2765> <t2766>Not all Commanders have a Handmaid: the Wives of some of them have children.</t2766> <t2767>From each according to his abilities; to each according to his needs, says the phrase.</t2767> <t2768>We recited it three times a day, after dessert.</t2768>
<t2769>It was a phrase from the Bible, or so they said.</t2769> <t2770>Once again Saint Paul, from the Acts.</t2770>
<t2771>You are a generation of transition, Aunt Lydia said.</t2771> <t2772>It is the most difficult.</t2772> <t2773>We know how many sacrifices you will have to make.</t2773> <t2774>It is difficult when men insult you.</t2774>
<t2775>It will be easier for those who come after you.</t2775> <t2776>They will accept their obligation willingly.</t2776>
<t2777>But he did not say: Because they will not have known another way of life.</t2777>
<t2778>He said: Because they will not want the things they cannot have.</t2778>
<t2779>Once a week we had movies, after lunch and before the nap.</t2779> <t2780>We would sit on the floor of the Domestic Economy room, on our gray mats, while Aunt Helena and Aunt Lydia struggled with the projection equipment.</t2780> <t2781>If we were lucky, they wouldn't load the film backwards.</t2781> <t2782>This reminded me of geography classes, when I went to school, thousands of years ago, and they showed us films from the rest of the world; women dressed in long skirts or cheap printed cotton dresses, carrying bundles of firewood, or baskets, or plastic buckets with water they fetched from some river, and babies hanging from their shawls or net slings.</t2782> <t2783>They looked at the camera sideways or with a frightened expression, knowing that something was being done to them with a machine with a single glass eye, but not knowing what.</t2783> <t2784>Those films were comforting and terribly boring.</t2784> <t2785>They made me feel sleepy, even when men appeared on the screen showing their muscles, breaking the hard ground with rudimentary hoes and shovels, and moving rocks.</t2785> <t2786>I preferred the films where you could see dances, songs, ceremonial masks, and carved objects turned into musical instruments: feathers, brass buttons, seashells, drums.</t2786> <t2787>I liked to see these people when they were happy, not when they were miserable and starving, emaciated, or exhausting themselves to death over some trivial task like digging a well or irrigating the land, problems that civilized nations had solved long ago.</t2787> <t2788>I thought it was enough for someone to provide them with the technological means and let them use them.</t2788>
<t2789>Aunt Lydia didn't show us this type of movies.</t2789>
<t2790>Sometimes he would put on an old pornographic movie for us, from the seventies or eighties.</t2790> <t2791>Women kneeling and sucking penises or guns, women tied up or chained or with dog collars around their necks, women hanging from trees, or upside down, naked, with their legs spread, women being raped or beaten or killed.</t2791> <t2792>Once we had to watch as a woman was dismembered, her fingers and breasts cut off with pruning shears, her stomach opened and her intestines pulled out.</t2792>
<t2793>Consider the possibilities, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t2793> <t2794>Do you see how things used to be?</t2794>
<t2795>That was what they thought of women back then.</t2795> <t2796>His voice trembled with indignation.</t2796>
<t2797>Later, Moira said it wasn't real, that it was filmed with models; but it was hard to tell.</t2797>
<t2798>Sometimes, however, the movie was what Aunt Lydia called a documentary about Unwomen.</t2798> <t2799>Imagine, Aunt Lydia would say, what it means to waste time in that way, when they should have been doing something useful.</t2799> <t2800>Before, Unwomen were always wasting time.</t2800> <t2801>They were encouraged to do so.</t2801> <t2802>The government provided them with money to do exactly that.</t2802> <t2803>The truth is, they had some pretty good ideas, she continued, with the self-satisfied tone of someone in a position to judge.</t2803> <t2804>Even now, we should allow some of their ideas to continue.</t2804> <t2805>Only some, really, she would say shyly, raising her index finger and waving it in front of us.</t2805> <t2806>But they were atheists, and there's the big difference, don't you think?</t2806>
<t2807>I sit on my mat, with my hands crossed; Aunt Lydia steps aside, moving away from the screen; the lights go out and I wonder if in the darkness I could lean to the right without being seen and whisper something to the woman next to me.</t2807> <t2808>But what can I whisper to her?</t2808> <t2809>I will ask her if she has seen Moira.</t2809> <t2810>Because no one has seen her, she didn't show up at breakfast time.</t2810> <t2811>But the room, although dimly lit, is not dark enough, so I change my attitude, pretending to pay attention.</t2811> <t2812>In movies of this type, they don't connect the soundtrack, but they do in the case of porn movies.</t2812> <t2813>They want us to hear the screams, the moans, and the shrieks of what could be extreme pain or extreme pleasure, or both at the same time, but they don't want us to hear what the Unwomen are saying.</t2813>
<t2814>First, the title and some names appear —which are crossed out with charcoal so that we cannot read them—, and then I see my mother.</t2814> <t2815>My mother when she was young, younger than I remember her, as young as she must have been before I was born.</t2815> <t2816>She is wearing the type of clothing that, according to Aunt Lydia, was typical of the Unwomen at that time: a denim jumpsuit, a green and mauve plaid shirt underneath, and canvas shoes; it is the type of clothing that Moira used to wear at one time, the type of clothing I remember wearing myself a long time ago.</t2816>
<t2817>She wears her hair tied at the nape with a mauve-colored scarf.</t2817> <t2818>Her young face is very serious, though beautiful.</t2818> <t2819>I had forgotten that my mother was once so beautiful and so passionate.</t2819> <t2820>She is gathered with other women who are dressed in the same way; she is holding a stick, no, it's the handle of a banner.</t2820> <t2821>The camera takes a panoramic view and we see the inscription, painted on what must have been a sheet: GIVE US BACK THE NIGHT.</t2821> <t2822>This one has not been crossed out, but we are supposed not to read it.</t2822> <t2823>The women around me gasp and in the room there is a movement similar to that of grass when it is stirred by the wind.</t2823> <t2824>Is it an oversight, and that's why we have escaped punishment?</t2824> <t2825>Or was it something deliberate, to remind us of the old times when there was no security?</t2825>
<t2826>Behind this sign, there are others, and the camera briefly captures them: FREEDOM</t2826>
<t2827>TO CHOOSE.</t2827> <t2828>WE WANT WANTED BABIES LET'S RESCUE OUR</t2828>
<t2829>BODIES.</t2829> <t2830>DO YOU BELIEVE THAT A WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE KITCHEN?</t2830> <t2831>Under the last poster, the body of a woman is drawn on a table, with blood gushing out.</t2831>
<t2832>Now my mother advances, she is smiling, laughing, everyone advances with their fists raised.</t2832> <t2833>The camera moves towards the sky, where hundreds of balloons with strings hanging are rising: red balloons that have a circle painted on them, a circle with a tail like that of an apple, but the tail is a cross.</t2833> <t2834>The camera descends again; now my mother is part of the crowd and I can no longer see her.</t2834>
<t2835>"I had you when I was thirty-seven years old," my mother told me.</t2835> <t2836>"It was a risk, you could have been born deformed, or something like that."</t2836> <t2837>"You were a wanted baby, that's for sure, and I received criticism from many people."</t2837> <t2838>"My old friend Tricia Foreman accused me of being a pronatalist, the bitch."</t2838> <t2839>"I attributed it to jealousy."</t2839> <t2840>"Some, however, behaved well."</t2840> <t2841>"But when I was six months pregnant, many of them started sending me those articles about how after thirty-five the risk of having children with congenital defects increases."</t2841> <t2842>"Exactly what I needed."</t2842> <t2843>"And nonsense about how difficult it was to be a single mother."</t2843> <t2844>"Take that shit away from here," I told them, "I've started this and I'm going to finish it."</t2844> <t2845>In the hospital chart, they wrote: "Elderly primipara," I caught them while they were noting it down.</t2845> <t2846>That's what they call women over thirty who are expecting their first baby.</t2846> <t2847>"All that is garbage," I told them, "biologically I am twenty-two years old, I could run circles around all of you."</t2847> <t2848>"I could have triplets and walk out of here while you would still be trying to get out of bed."</t2848>
<t2849>While she was saying it, her chin was jutting out.</t2849> <t2850>I remember her like that, with her chin jutting out and a glass in front of her, at the kitchen table; not as young, passionate, and pretty as she appeared in the movie, but strong, brave, the kind of old lady who wouldn't let someone cut in front of her in the supermarket line.</t2850>
<t2851>He liked to come to my house for a drink while Luke and I prepared dinner, and tell us what was going wrong in his life, which always turned into what was going wrong in ours.</t2851> <t2852>At that time, he had gray hair, of course.</t2852>
<t2853>She would never have dyed it.</t2853> <t2854>Why pretend, she said. Anyway, what do I want it for, I don't want any man by my side, what are they good for, except for the ten seconds they spend making half a baby.</t2854> <t2855>A man is simply a woman's instrument to make other women.</t2855> <t2856>I'm not saying your father wasn't a good guy and all that, but he wasn't ready for fatherhood.</t2856> <t2857>And it's not that I expected that from him.</t2857> <t2858>Just do your job, and then you can disappear, I told him, I have a decent salary and I can take care of her.</t2858> <t2859>So he went to the coast and sent me Christmas postcards.</t2859> <t2860>He had beautiful blue eyes.</t2860> <t2861>But they all lack something, even the handsome ones.</t2861> <t2862>It's like they're permanently distracted, like they can't exactly remember who they are.</t2862> <t2863>They look at the sky a lot.</t2863> <t2864>And</t2864>
<t2865>they lose touch with reality.</t2865> <t2866>They are not even comparable to women, except that they are better at fixing cars and playing football, which is exactly what we need for the progress of the human race, right?</t2866>
<t2867>This is how she spoke, even in front of Luke.</t2867> <t2868>He didn't mind and teased her by pretending to be a macho, telling her that women were not capable of abstract thinking, and she would take another drink and give him a mocking smile.</t2868>
<t2869>Chauvinist pig, she would say to him.</t2869>
<t2870>Doesn't it seem old-fashioned to you? Luke asked me, and my mother looked at him with a certain malice, almost furtively.</t2870>
<t2871>I have the right, I replied to him.</t2871> <t2872>I am old enough, I have paid all my debts, now it's my turn to be old-fashioned.</t2872> <t2873>You still don't know how to wipe your nose.</t2873> <t2874>I should have called you piglet.</t2874>
<t2875>As far as you're concerned, he told me, you're nothing but a game to him.</t2875> <t2876>A flare that quickly dies out.</t2876> <t2877>Time will prove me right.</t2877>
<t2878>But he only said these kinds of things after the third drink.</t2878>
<t2879>You young people do not know how to appreciate things, he continued.</t2879> <t2880>You do not know what we have had to go through to get you where you are.</t2880> <t2881>Look at him, he is the one peeling the carrots.</t2881> <t2882>Do you know how many women's lives, how many women's bodies the tanks have had to crush to reach this situation?</t2882>
<t2883>The kitchen is my favorite hobby, said Luke.</t2883> <t2884>I enjoy cooking.</t2884>
<t2885>A very original hobby, my mother replied.</t2885> <t2886>You don't have to explain yourself to me.</t2886> <t2887>In other times, they wouldn't have allowed you to have such a hobby; they would have called you a sissy.</t2887>
<t2888>Let's go, mother, I would say to her.</t2888> <t2889>Let's not argue over silly things.</t2889>
<t2890>Nonsense, he repeated bitterly.</t2890> <t2891>He called them nonsense.</t2891> <t2892>I see that you don't understand.</t2892> <t2893>You don't understand anything I'm saying.</t2893>
<t2894>Sometimes she would burst into tears.</t2894> <t2895>She was so lonely..., she would say.</t2895> <t2896>You have no idea how lonely she was.</t2896> <t2897>And she had friends, she was fortunate, but she was still lonely.</t2897>
<t2898>In certain aspects, I admired my mother, although things between us were never easy.</t2898> <t2899>I felt that she expected too much from me.</t2899> <t2900>She expected me to vindicate her life and the choices she had made.</t2900> <t2901>I did not want to live my life according to her terms.</t2901> <t2902>I did not want to be a model daughter, the embodiment of her ideas.</t2902>
<t2903>We used to argue about that.</t2903> <t2904>I am not the justification for your existence, I once told him.</t2904>
<t2905>I want to have her by my side again.</t2905> <t2906>I want to have everything again, just as it was.</t2906> <t2907>But this desire makes no sense.</t2907>
<t2908>CHAPTER 21</t2908>
<t2909>It's hot here, and there's a lot of noise.</t2909> <t2910>The voices of the women rise around me in a soft chant that is still too loud for me, after so many days of silence.</t2910> <t2911>In a corner of the room, there's a blood-stained sheet, bundled up and thrown aside, from when Janine's water broke.</t2911> <t2912>I hadn't noticed until now.</t2912>
<t2913>The room also smells, the air is heavy, they should open a window.</t2913>
<t2914>The smell that is felt is that of our own flesh, an organic smell, of sweat with a hint of iron that must come from the blood on the sheet, and another smell, more animalistic, that surely comes from Janine: the smell of a den, an inhabited cave, the smell of the checkered blanket on which the cat once gave birth, before she was sterilized.</t2914>
<t2915>Smell of the womb.</t2915>
<t2916>—Breathe in, breathe in —we sing, just as we were taught—.</t2916> <t2917>Hold it, hold it.</t2917>
<t2918>Expel, expel, expel —we sing until we reach five.</t2918> <t2919>Five to inhale, five to hold it, and five to exhale.</t2919> <t2920>Janine, with her eyes closed, tries to slow the pace of her breathing.</t2920> <t2921>Aunt Elizabeth feels for the contractions.</t2921>
<t2922>Now Janine is restless and wants to walk.</t2922> <t2923>The two women help her get out of bed and support her on each side as she walks.</t2923> <t2924>A contraction comes over her, forcing her to bend over.</t2924> <t2925>One of the women kneels and rubs her back.</t2925> <t2926>All of us know how to do it, we have received lessons.</t2926> <t2927>I recognize Deglen, my shopping partner, two seats away from mine.</t2927> <t2928>The soft chant envelops us like a membrane.</t2928>
<t2929>A Martha arrives with a tray: a pitcher with fruit juice, like the powdered kind, which seems to be grape, and a bunch of cardboard cups.</t2929> <t2930>She places it on the carpet, in front of the women who are singing.</t2930> <t2931>Without losing the rhythm, Deglen serves the juice and the cups make their way down the row.</t2931>
<t2932>I receive a glass, lean to the side to pass it, and the woman next to me whispers in my ear:</t2932>
<t2933>—Are you looking for someone?</t2933>
<t2934>—Moira —I say to her, also in a low voice—.</t2934> <t2935>Dark hair and freckles.</t2935>
<t2936>—No —the woman replies—.</t2936> <t2937>I don't know her, she wasn't with me at the Center, although I've seen her shopping.</t2937> <t2938>But I will look for her for you.</t2938>
<t2939>—Who are you? —I ask him.</t2939>
<t2940>—Soul —she responds—.</t2940> <t2941>What is your real name?</t2941>
<t2942>I want to tell you that there was another Alma in the Center.</t2942> <t2943>I want to tell you my name, but Aunt Elizabeth lifts her head and scans the room with her gaze; she must have noticed a disruption in the chant, so I don't have time.</t2943> <t2944>Sometimes, on Birthdays, you find out things.</t2944> <t2945>But it wouldn't make sense to ask about Luke.</t2945> <t2946>He must not have been anywhere that any of these women could have seen him.</t2946>
<t2947>The chant continues, and it starts to infect me.</t2947> <t2948>It's difficult, you have to concentrate.</t2948>
<t2949>Identify yourselves with your body, said Aunt Elizabeth.</t2949> <t2950>I can already feel slight pains in my belly and heaviness in my breasts.</t2950> <t2951>Janine screams, it is a weak scream, a mix of a scream and a moan.</t2951>
<t2952>—She is going into a trance —says Aunt Elizabeth.</t2952>
<t2953>One of the assistants wipes Janine's forehead with a damp cloth.</t2953> <t2954>Janine is sweating, some strands of hair come loose from the elastic band and smaller ones stick to her forehead and neck.</t2954> <t2955>Her skin is damp, soaked, and shiny.</t2955>
<t2956>—Pant! Pant! Pant! —we sang.</t2956>
<t2957>—I want to go out —says Janine—.</t2957> <t2958>I want to take a walk.</t2958> <t2959>I feel good.</t2959> <t2960>I need to go to the restroom.</t2960>
<t2961>We all know that she is in a moment of transition, that she doesn't know what she is doing.</t2961>
<t2962>Which of these statements is true?</t2962> <t2963>Probably the last one.</t2963> <t2964>Aunt Elizabeth makes a signal; two women position themselves next to the portable sink and help Janine to sit on it.</t2964> <t2965>Now another smell is added to those already in the room.</t2965> <t2966>Janine groans again and tilts her head in such a way that we can only see her hair.</t2966> <t2967>Hunched like that, she looks like a doll with her arms akimbo, an old doll that has been mistreated and abandoned in a corner.</t2967>
<t2968>Janine is standing again and walking.</t2968>
<t2969>"I want to sit down," she says.</t2969> <t2970>How long have we been here?</t2970> <t2971>Minutes or hours.</t2971> <t2972>I'm sweating, my dress is soaked under the armpits, my upper lip tastes like salt; false pains come over me, the others feel them too: I know by the way they move.</t2972> <t2973>Janine is sucking on an ice cube.</t2973> <t2974>Then, a few steps or kilometers away, she screams—: No.</t2974> <t2975>Oh no, oh no, oh no —this is her second baby, she had a child, once.</t2975> <t2976>I found out at the Center because she used to call out for him at night, just like the others but louder.</t2976> <t2977>So she should be able to remember this, to remember how it is and what will happen.</t2977>
<t2978>But who can remember the pain, once it has disappeared?</t2978> <t2979>All that remains of it is a shadow, not even in the mind nor in the flesh.</t2979> <t2980>Pain leaves a mark too deep to be seen, a mark that is beyond the reach of sight and mind.</t2980>
<t2981>Someone has finished the grape juice and someone has swiped a bottle.</t2981> <t2982>This is not the first time something like this has happened at a meeting of this kind; but they will turn a blind eye.</t2982> <t2983>We also need our orgies.</t2983>
<t2984>—Dim the lights —says Aunt Elizabeth—.</t2984> <t2985>Tell him that the time has come.</t2985>
<t2986>Someone stands up, walks to the wall, and the light becomes dimmer until the room is in semi-darkness; the tone of our voices decreases until it becomes a chorus of creaks, of hoarse murmurs, like grasshoppers in the night.</t2986> <t2987>Two women leave the room; two others lead Janine to the Birthing Chair, and she sits in the lower seat.</t2987> <t2988>Now she is calmer, the air enters her lungs at a steady pace; we lean forward, we are so tense that our back and stomach muscles ache.</t2988> <t2989>It is coming, it is coming, like the sound of a bugle calling to arms, like a wall collapsing, it gives us the same sensation as a stone descending inside our bodies, and we think we are going to explode.</t2989>
<t2990>We hold hands, we are no longer alone.</t2990>
<t2991>The Commander's Wife rushes in; she is still wearing the ridiculous white cotton nightgown, under which her lanky legs stick out.</t2991> <t2992>Two Wives, dressed in blue suits and veils, hold her by the arms, as if she needed it.</t2992> <t2993>A tense smile is drawn on her face, like that of a hostess during a party she would have preferred not to host.</t2993> <t2994>She must know what we think of her.</t2994>
<t2995>She climbs onto the Birthing Stool and sits in the seat that is behind and above Janine, in such a way that she surrounds Janine's body: her skinny legs are placed at the sides, like the arms of an eccentric chair.</t2995> <t2996>Strangely enough, she is wearing white cotton socks and blue slippers made of a fuzzy material, like toilet seat covers.</t2996> <t2997>But we do not pay attention to the Wife, we barely see her, our eyes are fixed on Janine.</t2997> <t2998>Under the dim light, dressed in her white outfit, she shines like a moon peeking through the clouds.</t2998>
<t2999>Now Janine groans because of the effort.</t2999>
<t3000>—Push, push, push —we whisper—.</t3000> <t3001>Relax.</t3001> <t3002>Pant.</t3002> <t3003>Push, push, push —we accompany her, we are one with her, we are drunk.</t3003> <t3004>Aunt Elizabeth kneels; in her hands, she holds a towel spread out to catch the baby, here is the crowning of everything, the glory, the purple head stained with yogurt, another push and it will slide out, smeared with fluid and blood, fulfilling our wait.</t3004> <t3005>Oh, blessed be.</t3005>
<t3006>While Aunt Elizabeth inspects her, we hold our breath; it's a girl, very small, but for now, she's fine, she has no defects, that's already clear, hands, feet, eyes, we count them in silence, everything is in its place.</t3006> <t3007>With the baby in her arms, Aunt Elizabeth looks at us and smiles.</t3007> <t3008>We also smile, we are one single smile, tears fall down our cheeks, we are very happy.</t3008>
<t3009>Our happiness is, in part, memory.</t3009> <t3010>What I remember is Luke when he was with me in the hospital, standing by my head, holding my hand, dressed in the green gown and white mask they had provided him.</t3010> <t3011>Oh, he exclaimed, oh, Jesus, with a sigh of surprise.</t3011> <t3012>He said that night he felt so important that he couldn't sleep a wink.</t3012>
<t3013>Aunt Elizabeth is carefully washing the baby, who doesn't cry too much.</t3013>
<t3014>As silently as possible, so as not to startle him, we get up, we huddle around Janine, we hug her, we pat her on the back.</t3014> <t3015>She is also crying.</t3015> <t3016>The two Wives in blue help the third Wife, the Wife of the family, to get down from the Birthing Chair and onto the bed, where they lay her down and tuck her in.</t3016> <t3017>The baby, now clean and calm, is ceremoniously placed in her arms.</t3017> <t3018>The Wives who are downstairs come up in a rush, pushing us aside.</t3018> <t3019>They speak very loudly, some of them still carrying their plates, their coffee cups, their wine glasses, some still chewing, they crowd around the bed, around the mother and the child, congratulating and cooing.</t3019> <t3020>Envy emanates from them, I can smell it, like faint traces of acid mixed with their perfume.</t3020> <t3021>The Commander's Wife looks at the baby as if it were a bouquet of flowers, something she has won, a tribute.</t3021>
<t3022>The Wives are here as witnesses to the name selection.</t3022> <t3023>They are the ones who choose it.</t3023>
<t3024>—Angela —says the Commander's Wife.</t3024>
<t3025>—Angela, Angela —the Wives repeat nervously—.</t3025> <t3026>What a sweet name! Oh, she is perfect! Oh, she is wonderful!</t3026>
<t3027>We stand between Janine and the bed, so she cannot see him.</t3027>
<t3028>Someone gives her a sip of grape juice, I hope they added wine; she still feels the postpartum pains, crying inconsolably, consumed by tears.</t3028> <t3029>However, we feel somewhat touched; this is a victory for all of us.</t3029> <t3030>We have achieved it.</t3030>
<t3031>They will allow her to feed the baby for a few months.</t3031> <t3032>They believe in breast milk.</t3032> <t3033>Afterwards, Janine will be transferred to see if she can do it again with someone else who needs a change.</t3033> <t3034>But she will never be sent to the Colonies, she will never be declared Unwoman.</t3034> <t3035>That is her reward.</t3035>
<t3036>The Birthmobile is outside, waiting to take us back to our homes.</t3036> <t3037>The doctors are still in the van; through the window, we see their faces like white smudges, like the face of a sick child confined to their home.</t3037> <t3038>One of them opens the door and approaches us.</t3038>
<t3039>—Did everything go well? —he asks anxiously.</t3039>
<t3040>—Yes —I respond.</t3040> <t3041>At this moment, I feel torn, exhausted.</t3041> <t3042>My breasts hurt, they even leak; it's a substitute for milk, it happens to some of us.</t3042> <t3043>We sit on our benches, facing each other, as we are transported; we are left without emotion, almost without sensations, we must be like bundles of red cloth.</t3043> <t3044>Everything hurts.</t3044> <t3045>In our laps, we carry a specter, a ghost baby.</t3045>
<t3046>Now that the nervousness has passed, we must face the failure.</t3046> <t3047>Mother, I think.</t3047>
<t3048>Wherever you are, can you hear me?</t3048> <t3049>You wanted a culture of women.</t3049> <t3050>Well, here you have it.</t3050> <t3051>It is not what you intended, but it exists.</t3051> <t3052>You have something to be thankful for.</t3052>
<t3053>CHAPTER 22</t3053>
<t3054>The Birthmobile arrives at the house late in the afternoon.</t3054> <t3055>The sun shines faintly through the clouds, and the scent of damp grass beginning to warm up floats in the air.</t3055> <t3056>I've spent the whole day at the Birth ceremony, and I've lost track of time.</t3056>
<t3057>Today's shopping must have been done by Cora, because I am exempt from all obligations.</t3057> <t3058>I climb the stairs, heavily lifting my feet from one step to the next and holding onto the railing.</t3058> <t3059>I feel as if I have been on my feet for several days, running all the time; my chest hurts and my muscles cramp as if I were lacking sugar.</t3059> <t3060>For once in my life, I long to be alone.</t3060>
<t3061>I lie down on the bed.</t3061> <t3062>I would like to rest, fall asleep, but I am too fatigued and at the same time so excited that I couldn't close my eyes.</t3062> <t3063>I gaze at the flat sky or, following with my eyes the leaves of the garland.</t3063> <t3064>Today it reminds me of a hat, one of those wide-brimmed ones that women used to wear in the past: hats like enormous halos, adorned with fruits and flowers and feathers of exotic birds; hats that represented the idea of paradise floating exactly above the head, a solidified thought.</t3064>
<t3065>In a minute, the garland will start to change color and I will start to see things.</t3065> <t3066>This is how exhausted I am: just like when you've been driving all night, in the dark, for some reason, now I must not think about that, telling stories to keep ourselves awake and taking turns driving, and as the sun rises, you start to see things out of the corner of your eye: monstrous animals in the roadside bushes, blurred silhouettes of men that disappear when you look at them directly.</t3066>
<t3067>I am too tired to continue with this story.</t3067> <t3068>I am too tired to think about where I am.</t3068> <t3069>Here goes a different story, a better one.</t3069> <t3070>This is the story of what happened to Moira.</t3070>
<t3071>I can complete part of it on my own, the other part I learned from Alma, who learned from Dolores, who learned from Janine.</t3071> <t3072>Janine learned from Aunt Lydia.</t3072>
<t3073>Even in places like this, alliances exist, even under such circumstances.</t3073> <t3074>This is something you can be sure of: there will always be alliances, of one kind or another.</t3074>
<t3075>Aunt Lydia called Janine to her office.</t3075>
<t3076>Blessed be the fruit, Janine, Aunt Lydia must have said, without lifting her gaze from the desk, at which she was sitting writing something.</t3076> <t3077>All rules always have an exception: you can be sure of this too.</t3077> <t3078>Aunts are allowed to read and write.</t3078>
<t3079>May the Lord allow it to ripen, Janine would have responded in a subdued tone, with her transparent voice, her voice like raw egg white.</t3079>
<t3080>I feel that I can trust you, Janine, Aunt Lydia must have said, finally lifting her eyes from the page and fixing them on Janine with that characteristic expression, looking at her through her glasses, a look that managed to be both threatening and pleading at the same time.</t3080> <t3081>Help me, that look said, we are in this together.</t3081> <t3082>You are a trustworthy girl, she continued, not like some others.</t3082>
<t3083>He thought that all of Janine's whining and regrets meant something, he thought that Janine had broken down, he thought that Janine was a true believer.</t3083>
<t3084>But back then, Janine was like a puppy that had been kicked many times, by many people, for no reason: she would have gone along with anyone, said anything, just for a moment of approval.</t3084>
<t3085>So Janine must have said: I hope so, Aunt Lydia.</t3085> <t3086>I hope I have proven myself worthy of your trust.</t3086> <t3087>Or something like that.</t3087>
<t3088>Janine, Aunt Lydia said, something terrible has happened.</t3088>
<t3089>Janine stared at the ground.</t3089> <t3090>Whatever it was, she knew they couldn't blame her, she was innocent.</t3090> <t3091>But what good had it done her to be innocent in the past?</t3091> <t3092>So at the same time, she felt guilty, and as if she were about to be punished.</t3092>
<t3093>Do you know anything about that, Janine? Aunt Lydia asked her softly.</t3093>
<t3094>No, Aunt Lydia, said Janine.</t3094> <t3095>She knew that at this moment it was essential to lift her gaze and look Aunt Lydia in the eyes.</t3095> <t3096>She managed it after a moment.</t3096>
<t3097>Because if you know it, I will feel very disappointed, said Aunt Lydia.</t3097>
<t3098>I call the Lord as my witness, replied Janine in a display of her fervor.</t3098>
<t3099>Aunt Lydia made one of her pauses.</t3099> <t3100>She toyed with the pen.</t3100> <t3101>Moira is no longer with us, she finally said.</t3101>
<t3102>Oh, Janine was astonished.</t3102> <t3103>She was neutral about this.</t3103> <t3104>Moira was not her friend.</t3104>
<t3105>Has he died? he asked.</t3105>
<t3106>Then Aunt Lydia told the story.</t3106> <t3107>During the Exercises, Moira had raised her hand to go to the bathroom.</t3107> <t3108>And she had disappeared.</t3108> <t3109>Aunt Elizabeth was on duty in the bathroom.</t3109> <t3110>She was outside, as usual; Moira went in.</t3110> <t3111>A moment later, Moira called Aunt Elizabeth: the toilet was overflowing, could Aunt Elizabeth come in and fix it?</t3111> <t3112>It was true that sometimes the toilets would overflow.</t3112> <t3113>Unidentified people would fill them with heaps of toilet paper to make exactly that happen.</t3113> <t3114>The Aunts had been trying some foolproof system to prevent it, but resources were scarce and at the moment they had to make do with what they had on hand, and they hadn't thought of any way to lock up the toilet paper.</t3114> <t3115>They probably should have it on the other side of the door, on top of a table, and hand each person one or several sheets upon entering.</t3115> <t3116>But that would be in the future.</t3116> <t3117>It takes time to get the hang of something new.</t3117>
<t3118>Aunt Elizabeth, suspecting nothing bad, entered the bathroom.</t3118> <t3119>Aunt Lydia had to admit that it had been a bit reckless on her part.</t3119> <t3120>On the other hand, on previous occasions, she had entered to fix some toilet and nothing had happened to her.</t3120>
<t3121>Moira was not sitting, the water had spilled onto the floor, along with several pieces of disintegrated fecal matter.</t3121> <t3122>It was not pleasant at all, and Aunt Elizabeth was angry.</t3122> <t3123>Moira kindly stayed by her side and Aunt Elizabeth hurried into the cubicle that Moira had indicated and leaned over the back of the toilet.</t3123> <t3124>She tried to lift the porcelain lid and fiddle with the ball and rod device inside.</t3124> <t3125>She had both hands on the lid when she felt something hard, pointed, and probably metallic pressing into her ribs from behind.</t3125> <t3126>Don't move, said Moira, or I'll push it all the way in, I'll puncture your lungs.</t3126>
<t3127>Later they discovered that she had dismantled the inside of one of the toilets and had removed the pointed and thin lever, the part that is attached at one end to the arm and at the other to the chain.</t3127> <t3128>It's not very difficult if you know how to do it, and Moira had a knack for mechanics; she would fix her car herself when it was something simple.</t3128> <t3129>Immediately after this incident, the toilets were equipped with chains that secured the upper part, in such a way that when they flooded, it took a long time to open them.</t3129> <t3130>As a result, they often flooded.</t3130>
<t3131>Aunt Elizabeth couldn't see what Moira was pointing at her with.</t3131> <t3132>She is a brave woman...</t3132>
<t3133>Oh, yes, said Janine.</t3133>
<t3134>... but not reckless, said Aunt Lydia, frowning.</t3134> <t3135>Janine had shown herself to be excessively enthusiastic, which sometimes had the force of a denial.</t3135> <t3136>She did what Moira told her, continued Aunt Lydia.</t3136> <t3137>Moira took Aunt Elizabeth's cattle prod and whistle and ordered her to unhook them from her belt.</t3137> <t3138>Then she forced her to hurry down the stairs to the basement.</t3138> <t3139>They were not on the second floor but on the first, so they only had to go down two flights of stairs.</t3139> <t3140>It was the time when classes were taking place, so the hallways were empty.</t3140> <t3141>They saw another of the Aunts, but she was at the opposite end of the hallway and looking in another direction.</t3141> <t3142>At that moment Aunt Elizabeth could have screamed, but she knew Moira was serious; she had acquired a bad reputation.</t3142>
<t3143>Oh, yes, said Janine.</t3143>
<t3144>Moira made Aunt Elizabeth move along the corridor of empty locker rooms, made her go through the gym door and enter the furnace room.</t3144> <t3145>She told her to undress.</t3145>
<t3146>Oh, said Janine in a weak tone, as if protesting this sacrilege.</t3146>
<t3147>... and Moira took off her clothes and put on Aunt Elizabeth's, which were not exactly her size but fit her quite well.</t3147> <t3148>She wasn't too cruel to Aunt Elizabeth, as she allowed her to put on her red dress.</t3148> <t3149>She tore the veil into strips and used them to tie Aunt Elizabeth behind the oven.</t3149> <t3150>She stuffed a bunch of fabric into her mouth and tied it with another strip.</t3150> <t3151>She wrapped a strip around her neck and tied the other end to her feet, from behind.</t3151> <t3152>She is a cunning and dangerous person, said Aunt Lydia.</t3152>
<t3153>Janine asked: Can I sit down?, as if all of this was too much for her.</t3153>
<t3154>At last, he had something to negotiate with, at least something that served as a voucher.</t3154>
<t3155>Yes, Janine, Aunt Lydia responded, surprised, but knowing that at this moment she couldn't refuse.</t3155> <t3156>She was seeking Janine's attention, her cooperation.</t3156> <t3157>She pointed to the chair in the corner.</t3157> <t3158>Janine moved it forward.</t3158>
<t3159>When Aunt Elizabeth was well hidden and out of sight, behind the oven, Moira said to her: You know I could kill you.</t3159> <t3160>And hurt you so much that you would never have a healthy body again.</t3160> <t3161>I could hit you with this, or stab it into your eye.</t3161>
<t3162>Simply, if the occasion ever arises, remember that I didn't do it.</t3162>
<t3163>Aunt Lydia didn't tell this last part to Janine, but I suppose Moira said something like that.</t3163> <t3164>In any case, she didn't kill or mutilate Aunt Elizabeth who, a few days later, once she recovered from the seven hours spent behind the oven, and probably from the interrogation — because neither the Aunts nor the others had ruled out the possibility of complicity — returned to the Center to work.</t3164>
<t3165>Moira stood up and looked resolutely ahead.</t3165>
<t3166>He put his shoulders back, straightened his spine, and pressed his lips together.</t3166> <t3167>This was not our usual posture.</t3167> <t3168>We generally walked with our heads down, our eyes fixed on our hands or the ground.</t3168> <t3169>Moira didn't look much like Aunt Elizabeth, not even with the brown habit on; but her rigid posture was apparently enough to convince the Angels who were on guard and who had never seen us very closely, not even the Aunts, and perhaps them least of all.</t3169>
<t3170>So Moira walked straight to the front door, with the bearing of someone who knows where they are going; the Angels greeted her and she presented Aunt Elizabeth's pass, which they didn't bother to examine because no one would insult one of the Aunts in that way.</t3170> <t3171>And she disappeared.</t3171>
<t3172>Oh, said Janine.</t3172> <t3173>Who knows what she felt?</t3173> <t3174>Maybe she was glad.</t3174> <t3175>If so, she hid it very well.</t3175>
<t3176>So, Janine, Aunt Lydia said, this is what I want you to do.</t3176>
<t3177>Janine opened her eyes wide and tried to appear innocent and attentive.</t3177>
<t3178>I want you to open your eyes wide.</t3178> <t3179>Maybe one of the others was involved in this.</t3179>
<t3180>Yes, Aunt Lydia, said Janine.</t3180>
<t3181>And if you hear something, come and tell me, will you, dear?</t3181>
<t3182>Yes, Aunt Lydia, said Janine.</t3182> <t3183>She knew she would never have to kneel at the front of the class again, nor hear all of us shouting that it had been her fault.</t3183> <t3184>Now it would be someone else's turn.</t3184> <t3185>For the moment, she was off the hook.</t3185>
<t3186>The fact that she told Dolores everything about the interview in Aunt Lydia's office meant nothing.</t3186> <t3187>It didn't mean that she wouldn't testify against us, against any of us, if given the chance.</t3187> <t3188>We knew that.</t3188> <t3189>Back then, we treated her the same way people used to treat one of those legless individuals who sell pencils on street corners.</t3189> <t3190>We avoided her whenever we could and were charitable to her when we had no other choice.</t3190> <t3191>She represented a danger to us, we knew that.</t3191>
<t3192>Dolores probably patted her on the back and told her she was a good companion when she told us.</t3192> <t3193>Where did this exchange take place?</t3193> <t3194>In the gym, while we were getting ready for bed.</t3194> <t3195>Dolores's bed was next to Janine's.</t3195>
<t3196>That night, the tale of what had happened spread among us, in the semi-darkness, in hushed tones, from bed to bed.</t3196>
<t3197>Moira was outside, somewhere.</t3197> <t3198>She was either free or dead.</t3198> <t3199>What would she do?</t3199> <t3200>The thought of what she would do expanded until it filled the entire room.</t3200> <t3201>At any moment, an explosion could occur that would destroy everything, the window panes would fall inward, the doors would swing wide open...</t3201>
<t3202>Now Moira had power, she had been set free, she had set herself free.</t3202> <t3203>Now she was a free woman.</t3203>
<t3204>I think it seemed awful to us.</t3204>
<t3205>Moira was like an elevator with open sides.</t3205> <t3206>She made us dizzy.</t3206> <t3207>We were already losing our taste for freedom, it already seemed to us that these walls were safe.</t3207> <t3208>In the higher layers of the atmosphere you could disintegrate, vaporize, there would be no pressure to keep you together.</t3208>
<t3209>Anyway, Moira was our fantasy.</t3209> <t3210>We hugged her and she was with us in secret, like a stifled giggle.</t3210> <t3211>She was like the lava beneath the crust of everyday life.</t3211> <t3212>In the light of Moira, the Aunts seemed less fearsome and more absurd.</t3212> <t3213>Their power had cracks.</t3213> <t3214>They could be kidnapped in the bathrooms.</t3214> <t3215>It was the audacity that we liked.</t3215>
<t3216>We supposed that at any moment they would drag her in, as they had done before.</t3216> <t3217>We couldn't imagine what they would do to her this time.</t3217> <t3218>Whatever it was, it would be terrible.</t3218>
<t3219>But nothing happened.</t3219> <t3220>Moira did not appear again.</t3220> <t3221>For now.</t3221>
<t3222>CHAPTER 23</t3222>
<t3223>This is a reconstruction.</t3223> <t3224>All of this is a reconstruction.</t3224> <t3225>It is a reconstruction that is taking place now, in my head, while I am lying on my single bed, reviewing what I should or should not have said, what I should or should not have done, how I should have acted.</t3225> <t3226>If I ever get out of here...</t3226>
<t3227>Let's stop at this point.</t3227> <t3228>I intend to leave here.</t3228> <t3229>This cannot last a lifetime.</t3229> <t3230>Others have thought the same before, in bad times, and they were always right, they got out one way or another, and it didn't last a lifetime.</t3230> <t3231>Even though for them it lasted their whole life.</t3231>
<t3232>When I get out of here, if I am ever able to record this in some way, even by telling it to someone, it will also be a reconstruction and even another version.</t3232> <t3233>It is impossible to tell something exactly as it happened, because what one says can never be exact, something is always left out, there are many parts, aspects, undercurrents, nuances; too many details that could mean this or that, too many forms that cannot be fully described, too many aromas and flavors in the air or on the tongue, too many colors.</t3233> <t3234>But if you ever become a man, someday, in the future, if you manage to get that far, please remember this: you will never be as bound as a woman to the temptation of forgiving a man.</t3234> <t3235>It is hard to resist, believe me.</t3235> <t3236>But remember that forgiveness is also a sign of power.</t3236> <t3237>To implore it is a sign of power, and to deny or grant it is a sign of power, perhaps the greatest.</t3237>
<t3238>Perhaps none of this can be verified.</t3238> <t3239>Perhaps it is not really about who can possess whom, about who can do what to whom, even death, without being punished.</t3239>
<t3240>Maybe it's not about who can sit and who has to kneel or stand or lie down with their legs open.</t3240> <t3241>Maybe it's about who can do what to whom and be forgiven for it.</t3241> <t3242>Don't tell me it means the same thing.</t3242>
<t3243>I want you to kiss me, said the Commander.</t3243>
<t3244>Well, naturally something happened after that.</t3244> <t3245>Such requests never come out of the blue.</t3245>
<t3246>After all, I went to sleep, and I dreamed that I was wearing earrings, and one of them was broken; nothing more than that, simply the brain examining its most hidden files, and Cora woke me up by bringing me the dinner tray and time continued its course.</t3246>
<t3247>—Is it a pretty baby? —asks Cora as she sets down the tray.</t3247> <t3248>She must already know, they have a sort of oral telegraphy that spreads news from house to house; but it gives her pleasure to hear it, as if my words make it more real.</t3248>
<t3249>—It's beautiful —I respond—.</t3249> <t3250>A charm.</t3250> <t3251>It's a girl.</t3251>
<t3252>Cora smiles at me, hers is an all-encompassing smile.</t3252> <t3253>These are the moments that make her think that what she does is worth it.</t3253>
<t3254>—That's very good —she comments.</t3254> <t3255>Her voice is almost melancholic, and I think: of course.</t3255> <t3256>She would have liked to be there.</t3256> <t3257>It's like a party she couldn't attend.</t3257>
<t3258>—Maybe we will have one soon —she says in a timid tone.</t3258> <t3259>When she says we, she means me.</t3259> <t3260>It is my responsibility to pay the reward, justify the food and care I receive, like a queen ant with the eggs.</t3260> <t3261>Rita would disapprove of me, but not Cora.</t3261> <t3262>On the contrary, she depends on me.</t3262> <t3263>She has hopes, and I am the vehicle of her hopes.</t3263>
<t3264>What she expects is something very simple.</t3264> <t3265>She wants there to be a Birthday, here, with guests, food, and gifts; she wants a child to spoil in the kitchen, to iron their clothes, and to give them cookies when no one is looking.</t3265> <t3266>I have to provide her with these joys.</t3266> <t3267>I would prefer her disapproval; I feel I deserve something better.</t3267>
<t3268>The dinner consists of beef stew.</t3268> <t3269>I have trouble finishing it, because halfway through I remember what I had completely erased from my mind today.</t3269> <t3270>What they say is true, it is a state of trance, both giving birth and being there, you lose track of the rest of your life, you focus only on that moment.</t3270> <t3271>But now it comes back to my mind, and I know I'm not prepared.</t3271>
<t3272>The clock in the downstairs hallway strikes nine.</t3272> <t3273>I press my hands against the sides of my thighs, take a breath, walk down the hallway, and descend the stairs silently.</t3273> <t3274>Serena Joy must still be at the house where the Birth took place; that's called being lucky, because he couldn't have foreseen it.</t3274> <t3275>On days like this, the Wives lounge around for hours, helping to open gifts, gossiping, getting drunk.</t3275> <t3276>They have to do something to dispel their envy.</t3276>
<t3277>I back down the hallway on the lower floor, pass by the kitchen door, and walk to the next door, his.</t3277> <t3278>I wait outside, feeling like a creature that has been called to the principal's office.</t3278> <t3279>What have I done wrong?</t3279>
<t3280>My presence here is illegal.</t3280> <t3281>We are forbidden to be alone with the Commanders.</t3281> <t3282>Our mission is to procreate: we are not concubines, nor geishas, nor courtesans.</t3282> <t3283>On the contrary, they have done everything possible to separate us from that category.</t3283> <t3284>There should be no fun with respect to us, no room for hidden desires to flourish; no special favors can be obtained, neither from them nor from us, there is no basis on which love can settle.</t3284>
<t3285>We are matrices with two legs, that's all: we are sacred vessels, walking chalices.</t3285>
<t3286>So, why would he want to see me, at night and alone?</t3286>
<t3287>If I were caught, I would fall into Serena's ruthless hands.</t3287> <t3288>He must not interfere with the household discipline, that is a matter for the women.</t3288> <t3289>After this, reclassification would come.</t3289> <t3290>I could become an Unwoman.</t3290>
<t3291>But if I refused to see it, it could be worse.</t3291> <t3292>There is no doubt about who holds the real power.</t3292>
<t3293>There must be something he wants from me.</t3293> <t3294>To desire is to have some weakness.</t3294> <t3295>It is this weakness, whatever it may be, that attracts me.</t3295> <t3296>It is like a small crack in an otherwise impenetrable wall.</t3296> <t3297>If I press my eye to it, to this weakness of his, I may be able to clearly see how I should act.</t3297>
<t3298>I want to know what they want.</t3298>
<t3299>I raise my hand and knock on the door of this forbidden room in which I have never been, a room that women do not enter.</t3299> <t3300>Not even Serena Joy enters here, and the cleaning is done by the Guardians.</t3300> <t3301>What secrets, what masculine totems are kept here?</t3301>
<t3302>They tell me to come in.</t3302> <t3303>I open the door and enter.</t3303>
<t3304>What I find on the other side is something normal.</t3304> <t3305>I should say: what I find on the other side seems something normal.</t3305> <t3306>There is a desk, of course, with a Compucommunicator, and a black leather chair.</t3306> <t3307>On the desk, there is a pot with a plant, a set of pen holders, and papers.</t3307> <t3308>On the floor, an oriental rug; and a fireplace with no fire, a small brown plush sofa, a television set, a table, and a couple of chairs.</t3308>
<t3309>All the walls are covered with shelves filled with books.</t3309> <t3310>And they are full of books.</t3310> <t3311>Books, books, and more books perfectly in sight, without locks or drawers.</t3311> <t3312>It's no wonder we can't enter here.</t3312> <t3313>This is an oasis of the forbidden.</t3313> <t3314>I try not to fix my gaze on them.</t3314>
<t3315>The Commander is standing in front of the unlit fireplace, with his back to it, one elbow resting on the carved wooden mantel and the other hand in his pocket.</t3315> <t3316>It's a studied pose, like a heartthrob, taken from one of those glossy men's magazines.</t3316> <t3317>He probably decided beforehand that he would stand like that when I entered.</t3317> <t3318>And</t3318>
<t3319>when I knocked on the door, he surely ran to the fireplace and settled into that position.</t3319> <t3320>He would have to have one eye covered with a black patch and a scarf with a horseshoe pattern.</t3320>
<t3321>It does me good to think these things, as quickly as a tapping, a tremor of the mind.</t3321> <t3322>Like a mockery to myself.</t3322> <t3323>But this is panic.</t3323> <t3324>The truth is that I am terrified.</t3324>
<t3325>I don't say anything.</t3325>
<t3326>—Close the door —he says to me, in a kind tone.</t3326> <t3327>I do as he says, and I turn around—.</t3327>
<t3328>Hello —he/she greets me.</t3328>
<t3329>It is the old way of greeting.</t3329> <t3330>It had been a long time, years, since I had heard it.</t3330>
<t3331>Given the circumstances, a regression in time, a stagnation, seems out of place, even comical.</t3331> <t3332>Nothing appropriate comes to mind to respond.</t3332>
<t3333>I think I'm going to scream.</t3333>
<t3334>He must have noticed it because he looks at me surprised and frowns a little, something I decide to interpret as concern, although it could simply be irritation.</t3334>
<t3335>—Come here —he says—.</t3335> <t3336>You can sit down —he brings a chair and places it in front of his desk.</t3336> <t3337>Then he walks to another side and sits down slowly and, in my view, in a studied manner.</t3337> <t3338>This shows me that he hasn't brought me here to touch me against my will, or anything like that.</t3338> <t3339>He smiles.</t3339> <t3340>It's not a sinister or predatory smile.</t3340> <t3341>It's simply a smile, a formal smile, friendly but a bit distant, as if I were a kitten in a shop window, a cat he looks at but has no intention of buying.</t3341>
<t3342>I sit on the chair, upright and with my hands crossed on my lap.</t3342> <t3343>I have the feeling that my feet, shod in low red shoes, do not touch the ground.</t3343>
<t3344>But they touch it, of course.</t3344>
<t3345>—This must seem strange to you —he comments.</t3345>
<t3346>I limit myself to looking at him.</t3346> <t3347>The euphemism of the year, a phrase my mother uses.</t3347>
<t3348>He/She/It used to use.</t3348>
<t3349>I feel like a cotton candy: sugar and air.</t3349> <t3350>If I were squeezed, I would turn into a small pink ball, moist and oozing.</t3350>
<t3351>—I suppose it is a bit strange —he continues, as if I had responded.</t3351>
<t3352>I think I should wear a hat tied with a ribbon under my chin.</t3352>
<t3353>—I want... —he says.</t3353>
<t3354>I try not to lean forward.</t3354> <t3355>Yes? Yes, yes? What? do you want?</t3355> <t3356>But I will not reveal my anxiety.</t3356> <t3357>It's a negotiation session, they are about to exchange things.</t3357>
<t3358>She who does not hesitate is lost.</t3358> <t3359>I'm not going to give anything away: I only sell.</t3359>
<t3360>—I would like... —he continues—.</t3360> <t3361>It might seem silly —and he truly looks uncomfortable, shy would be the word, just as men used to be in the past.</t3361>
<t3362>He is shy enough to remember how to give that impression, and also to remember how attractive it used to make him to women.</t3362> <t3363>Young people don't know those tricks.</t3363> <t3364>They've never had to use them.</t3364>
<t3365>—I would like you to play a game of Intelect with me —he states.</t3365>
<t3366>I remain absolutely rigid.</t3366> <t3367>I don't move a single muscle in my face.</t3367> <t3368>So that's what's in the forbidden room! An Intelect!</t3368> <t3369>I feel like laughing, laughing out loud until I fall off the chair.</t3369> <t3370>Once, this was a game that old men and women played in the summer or in retirement homes when there was nothing good on television.</t3370> <t3371>Or teenagers, at one time, many many years ago.</t3371> <t3372>My mother had one stored in the back of the hallway closet, along with the cardboard boxes where she kept the Christmas tree ornaments.</t3372> <t3373>Once, when I was thirteen years old and was negligent and unhappy, my mother tried to get me interested in it.</t3373>
<t3374>Now, of course, it is something different.</t3374> <t3375>Now it is forbidden for us.</t3375> <t3376>Now it is dangerous.</t3376> <t3377>Now it is indecent.</t3377> <t3378>Now it is something he cannot do with his Wife.</t3378>
<t3379>Now it is attractive.</t3379> <t3380>Now he has committed himself.</t3380> <t3381>It is as if he had offered me drugs.</t3381>
<t3382>—Alright —I respond in an indifferent tone.</t3382> <t3383>In reality, I can barely speak.</t3383>
<t3384>He doesn't tell me why he wants to play Intelect with me.</t3384> <t3385>And I don't ask him.</t3385> <t3386>He just takes a box out of one of the drawers of his desk and opens it.</t3386> <t3387>There are the laminated wooden tiles just as I remember them, the board divided into squares, and the small racks to hold the letters.</t3387> <t3388>The Commander dumps the tiles onto the desk and starts turning them face down.</t3388> <t3389>I help him.</t3389>
<t3390>—Do you know how to play? —he asks me.</t3390>
<t3391>Seat.</t3391>
<t3392>We played two games.</t3392> <t3393>I form the word larynx.</t3393> <t3394>Canopy.</t3394> <t3395>Quince.</t3395> <t3396>Zygote.</t3396>
<t3397>I hold the shiny tiles with smooth edges and run my finger over the letters.</t3397> <t3398>It gives me a voluptuous sensation.</t3398> <t3399>This is freedom, turning a blind eye.</t3399> <t3400>I form the word limp.</t3400> <t3401>To satiate.</t3401> <t3402>What pleasure.</t3402> <t3403>The tiles are like peppermint candies, just as fresh.</t3403> <t3404>As children, we called them "camels."</t3404> <t3405>I would like to put them in my mouth.</t3405>
<t3406>They must also have a lime flavor.</t3406> <t3407>The letter C. Crunchy, slightly acidic to the palate, delicious.</t3407>
<t3408>He won the first game, and I let him win the second: I still haven't figured out what the conditions are, what I can ask for in return.</t3408>
<t3409>Finally, she tells me that it's time to go back home.</t3409> <t3410>That's the expression she uses: go back home.</t3410> <t3411>She refers to my room.</t3411> <t3412>She asks me if I'll get there safely, as if the staircase were a dark street.</t3412> <t3413>I tell her yes.</t3413> <t3414>We open the door to her office, just a crack, to see if anything can be heard in the hallway.</t3414>
<t3415>This is like having a date.</t3415> <t3416>It's like sneaking into the bedroom after hours.</t3416>
<t3417>This is a conspiracy.</t3417>
<t3418>—Thank you —he says to me—.</t3418> <t3419>For the game —and then he adds—: I want you to kiss me.</t3419>
<t3420>I think about how I could remove the back part of the toilet, the toilet in my bathroom, one of the nights when I take a bath, quickly and silently so that Cora, who is outside sitting on the chair, cannot hear me.</t3420> <t3421>I could take out the rod and hide it in my sleeve, and bring it hidden the next time I come to the Commander's office, because after a request like this there is always a next time, regardless of whether one says yes or no.</t3421> <t3422>I think about how I could approach the Commander and kiss him, here, alone, and take off his jacket as if allowing or inviting him to something more, like an approach to true love, and wrap my arms around him and take the rod out of my sleeve and suddenly stab the sharp tip between his ribs.</t3422> <t3423>I think about the blood that would spill, hot like soup and full of sex, over my hands.</t3423>
<t3424>Actually, I don't think about anything like that.</t3424> <t3425>It's simply something I add afterward.</t3425> <t3426>Maybe I should have thought about it at that moment, but I didn't.</t3426> <t3427>As I said before, this is a reconstruction.</t3427>
<t3428>—Alright —I say to him.</t3428> <t3429>I approach him and press my closed lips against his.</t3429> <t3430>I perceive the smell of his aftershave lotion, the usual one, with a hint of mothballs, quite familiar to me.</t3430> <t3431>But he is like someone I have just met.</t3431>
<t3432>He steps aside and looks at me.</t3432> <t3433>He smiles again with that shy smile.</t3433> <t3434>Such sincerity.</t3434>
<t3435>—Not like that —he tells me—.</t3435> <t3436>As if you were doing it for real.</t3436> <t3437>He was very sad.</t3437>
<t3438>This is also a reconstruction.</t3438>
<t3439>IX</t3439>
<t3440>THE NIGHT</t3440>
<t3441>CHAPTER 24</t3441>
<t3442>I return through the dimly lit hallway, climb the carpeted stairs, and sneak into my room.</t3442> <t3443>I sit in the chair, with the lights off, wearing the red dress buttoned up.</t3443> <t3444>One can only think clearly with clothes on.</t3444>
<t3445>What I need is perspective.</t3445> <t3446>The illusion of depth created by a frame, the arrangement of forms on a flat surface.</t3446> <t3447>Perspective is necessary.</t3447> <t3448>Otherwise, there would only be two dimensions.</t3448> <t3449>Otherwise, one would live with their face pressed against a wall, everything would be an enormous close-up of details, hairs, the fabric of the sheet, the molecules of the face.</t3449> <t3450>One's own skin like a map, a chart of uselessness crisscrossed by small roads that lead nowhere.</t3450> <t3451>Otherwise, one would live in the moment.</t3451> <t3452>Which is not where I want to be.</t3452>
<t3453>But that's where I am, there's no escape.</t3453> <t3454>Time is a trap in which I am caught.</t3454> <t3455>I must forget my secret name and the way back.</t3455> <t3456>Now my name is Offred, and this is where I live.</t3456>
<t3457>Live in the present, make the most of it, it is all you have.</t3457>
<t3458>Time to do the inventory.</t3458>
<t3459>I am thirty-three years old and have brown hair.</t3459> <t3460>I am one meter seventy tall without shoes.</t3460> <t3461>I have difficulty remembering what I used to look like.</t3461> <t3462>I have healthy ovaries.</t3462> <t3463>I have one chance left.</t3463>
<t3464>But now, tonight, something has changed.</t3464> <t3465>The circumstances have shifted.</t3465>
<t3466>I can ask for something.</t3466> <t3467>Maybe not much, but something.</t3467>
<t3468>Men are sex machines, Aunt Lydia used to say, and little else.</t3468> <t3469>They only want one thing.</t3469> <t3470>You must learn to influence them to your own benefit.</t3470> <t3471>Lead them by the nose; that's a metaphor.</t3471> <t3472>It's natural, a resource from God.</t3472> <t3473>That's how things are.</t3473>
<t3474>In reality, Aunt Lydia did not say this, but it was implied in her words.</t3474> <t3475>It floated above her head, like the golden halos worn by saints in the night of times.</t3475> <t3476>And like them, it was angular and gaunt.</t3476>
<t3477>But how to fit the Commander into this, as he lives in his office, with his word games and his desires, for what?</t3477> <t3478>So that he can play with him, so that he can kiss him softly, as if he were really doing it.</t3478>
<t3479>I know I need to seriously consider this desire of his.</t3479> <t3480>It could be important, it could be a passport, it could be my downfall.</t3480> <t3481>I must be serious about this, I have to ponder it.</t3481> <t3482>But whatever I do, sitting here in the darkness, with the spotlights illuminating the rectangle of my window from outside and through the sheer curtains like a wedding dress, like an ectoplasm, with one of my hands holding the other, rocking slightly back and forth, whatever I do, in all of this there is something funny.</t3482>
<t3483>He wanted me to play Intelect with him, and to kiss him as if I really meant it.</t3483>
<t3484>This is one of the most curious things that has ever happened to me.</t3484>
<t3485>Context is everything.</t3485>
<t3486>I remember a television program I saw once, a rerun of a show made several years earlier.</t3486> <t3487>I must have been seven or eight years old, too young to understand it.</t3487> <t3488>It was the type of program my mother loved to watch: historical, educational.</t3488> <t3489>Later she tried to explain it to me, telling me that the things shown there had really happened, but to me it was just a story.</t3489> <t3490>I thought someone had made it up.</t3490> <t3491>I suppose all children think the same about any story from before their own time.</t3491> <t3492>If it's just a story, it seems less frightening.</t3492>
<t3493>The program consisted of a documentary about one of those wars.</t3493>
<t3494>They interviewed people and showed clips from movies of the era, in black and white, and photographs.</t3494> <t3495>I don't remember much about the documentary, but I do remember the quality of the images, how everything in them seemed covered with a mix of sunlight and dust, and how dark the shadows were under the eyebrows and cheekbones.</t3495>
<t3496>The interviews with the people who were still alive were filmed in color.</t3496> <t3497>The one I remember best is the one they did with a woman who had been the lover of a man who supervised one of the camps where they locked up the Jews before killing them.</t3497> <t3498>In ovens, according to my mother; but there were no images of the ovens, so I formed the idea that these deaths had taken place in the kitchen.</t3498> <t3499>For a child, this idea holds something especially terrifying.</t3499> <t3500>Ovens are used for cooking, and cooking is what you do before eating.</t3500> <t3501>I imagined that those people had been eaten.</t3501> <t3502>And I suppose that, in a way, that's what happened to them.</t3502>
<t3503>From what they said, that man had been cruel and brutal.</t3503> <t3504>His lover —my mother explained the meaning of the word lover to me, she didn't like mysteries; when I was four years old, she bought me a book about sexual organs— had been a very beautiful woman.</t3504> <t3505>There was a black and white photo of her and another woman, dressed in the two-piece swimsuit, platform shoes, and wide-brimmed hat that were used at that time; they were wearing cat-eye sunglasses and were lying on some loungers by the pool.</t3505> <t3506>The pool was next to the house, which was near the field where they had the ovens.</t3506> <t3507>The woman said she hadn't noticed anything out of the ordinary.</t3507> <t3508>She denied being aware of the existence of the ovens.</t3508>
<t3509>At the time of the interview, forty or fifty years later, he was dying of emphysema.</t3509> <t3510>He coughed a lot and looked very thin, almost emaciated.</t3510>
<t3511>But she still felt proud of her appearance.</t3511> <t3512>(Look at her, my mother said a bit grudgingly and with a certain tone of admiration. She still feels proud of her appearance.)</t3512> <t3513>She was carefully made up, with a lot of mascara on her eyelashes and blush on her cheeks, and her skin was stretched tight like an inflated rubber glove.</t3513> <t3514>She wore jewelry.</t3514>
<t3515>He was not a monster, he said.</t3515> <t3516>People say that he was a monster, but it is not true.</t3516>
<t3517>What could she have been thinking about?</t3517> <t3518>I suppose about nothing; not the past, not that moment.</t3518> <t3519>She was thinking about how not to think.</t3519> <t3520>It was an abnormal time.</t3520> <t3521>She was proud of her appearance.</t3521> <t3522>She didn't believe he was a monster.</t3522> <t3523>He wasn't, to her.</t3523> <t3524>He probably had some attractive trait: he whistled off-key in the shower, liked truffles, called his dog Liebchen and made it sit to give it pieces of raw meat.</t3524> <t3525>How easy it is to invent anyone's humanity.</t3525> <t3526>What a realizable temptation.</t3526> <t3527>A big child, she must have told herself.</t3527> <t3528>Her heart must have softened, she must have brushed the hair from his forehead and kissed his ear, not precisely to get something from him.</t3528> <t3529>It was the soothing instinct, the instinct to make things better.</t3529> <t3530>Come on, come on, she would say to him when he woke up from a nightmare.</t3530> <t3531>This is very hard for you.</t3531> <t3532>This is what she must have believed because otherwise, how could she have continued living?</t3532> <t3533>Beneath that beauty hid a normal woman.</t3533> <t3534>She believed in decency, was kind to the Jewish maid, or quite kind, or kinder than the maid deserved.</t3534>
<t3535>A few days after this interview was filmed, he committed suicide.</t3535> <t3536>They said it on television.</t3536>
<t3537>Nobody asked her if she had loved him or not.</t3537>
<t3538>What I now remember, more clearly than anything else, is the makeup.</t3538>
<t3539>I stand up in the darkness and start to unbutton myself.</t3539> <t3540>Then I hear something inside my body.</t3540> <t3541>I have broken, something has split inside me, it must be that.</t3541> <t3542>The noise rises and comes out from the broken place to my face.</t3542> <t3543>Without warning: I was not thinking about anything.</t3543> <t3544>If I let this sound out into the air, it will turn into a laugh too loud, someone might hear and then there would be comings and goings, orders and who knows what else.</t3544> <t3545>Conclusion: emotion inappropriate to the circumstances The uterus that rambles they used to think.</t3545> <t3546>Hysteria.</t3546> <t3547>And then a needle, a pill.</t3547> <t3548>It could be fatal.</t3548>
<t3549>I put both hands in front of my mouth, as if I were about to vomit; I fall to my knees, the laughter boils in my throat as if it were lava.</t3549>
<t3550>I crawl to the closet and pull my knees up; I'm going to suffocate in here.</t3550> <t3551>My ribs hurt from holding in the laughter so much.</t3551> <t3552>I tremble, I shake, seismic, I'm going to explode like a volcano.</t3552> <t3553>The closet turns completely red, laughter rhymes with pregnant, oh, dying of laughter.</t3553>
<t3554>I hide my face in the folds of the hanging cloak, tightly close my eyes, and tears begin to well up.</t3554> <t3555>I try to calm myself.</t3555>
<t3556>After a while it passes, as if it were an epileptic seizure.</t3556> <t3557>Here I am, inside the closet.</t3557> <t3558>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t3558> <t3559>I can't see it in the dark, but I follow the tiny letters with my fingertips, as if it were a Braille code.</t3559> <t3560>Now it resonates in my head, not so much as a prayer but as an order, but to do what?</t3560> <t3561>In any case, it is useless to me, it is like an ancient hieroglyph whose key has been lost.</t3561> <t3562>Why did they write it, why did they bother to do it?</t3562> <t3563>There is no way out of here.</t3563>
<t3564>I remain lying on the floor, breathing rapidly, then more slowly, leveling my breath, like in childbirth exercises.</t3564> <t3565>The only thing I hear now is the sound of my heart, which opens and closes, opens and closes, opens.</t3565>
<t3566>X</t3566>
<t3567>THE SPIRITUAL SCROLLS</t3567>
<t3568>CHAPTER 25</t3568>
<t3569>The first thing I heard the next morning was a scream and a crash.</t3569> <t3570>It was Cora, who had dropped the breakfast tray.</t3570> <t3571>It woke me up.</t3571> <t3572>I still had half my body inside the wardrobe, and my head on the cloak, which was nothing more than a lump.</t3572>
<t3573>Surely I took it off the hanger and fell asleep on top of it.</t3573> <t3574>At first, I couldn't remember where I was.</t3574> <t3575>Cora was kneeling beside me; I felt her touch my back.</t3575> <t3576>When I moved, she screamed again.</t3576>
<t3577>What's happening?, I asked him.</t3577> <t3578>I turned around and sat up.</t3578>
<t3579>Oh, he said.</t3579> <t3580>I thought...</t3580>
<t3581>What did he/she believe?</t3581>
<t3582>Like..., I added.</t3582>
<t3583>The eggs were on the floor, broken, and there was orange juice and shattered glass.</t3583>
<t3584>I'll have to bring another one, he said.</t3584> <t3585>What a waste.</t3585> <t3586>What were you doing lying on the floor?</t3586> <t3587>He grabbed me to help me get up and stand.</t3587>
<t3588>I didn't want to tell him that I hadn't slept all night.</t3588> <t3589>I wouldn't have known how to explain it to him.</t3589> <t3590>I told him that I must have fainted.</t3590> <t3591>It was almost worse because he started drawing his own conclusions.</t3591>
<t3592>It's one of the first symptoms, he said with a tone of satisfaction.</t3592> <t3593>That, and the vomiting.</t3593>
<t3594>He should have realized that not enough time had passed; but he had high hopes.</t3594>
<t3595>No, that's not it, I told him.</t3595> <t3596>She was sitting in the chair.</t3596> <t3597>I'm sure that's not it.</t3597>
<t3598>I just got dizzy.</t3598> <t3599>I was here, and everything started to get dark.</t3599>
<t3600>It must have been because of yesterday's tension, he said.</t3600> <t3601>Take this off.</t3601>
<t3602>She was referring to the Nativity, and I told her yes.</t3602> <t3603>At that moment, I was sitting in the chair and she was kneeling beside me, picking up the pieces of egg and the broken glass and gathering them on the tray.</t3603> <t3604>She dried part of the orange juice with the paper napkin.</t3604>
<t3605>I'll have to bring a cloth, she commented.</t3605> <t3606>They'll want to know why I'm bringing more eggs.</t3606> <t3607>Unless you manage without them.</t3607> <t3608>She looked at me sideways, furtively, and I understood that it would be better if we both pretended that I had eaten the entire breakfast.</t3608> <t3609>If she said she had found me lying on the floor, there would be too many questions.</t3609> <t3610>In any case, she would have to explain the broken glass; but Rita would get in a bad mood if she had to prepare breakfast a second time.</t3610>
<t3611>I will manage without them, I assured him.</t3611> <t3612>I'm not very hungry.</t3612> <t3613>It was perfect because it fit with the dizziness.</t3613> <t3614>But I will eat the toast, I added.</t3614> <t3615>I didn't want to go completely without eating.</t3615>
<t3616>It's on the ground, he warned me.</t3616>
<t3617>It doesn't matter, I said to her.</t3617> <t3618>I sat down to eat the toast while she went into the bathroom and threw the handful of egg she couldn't recover into the toilet.</t3618>
<t3619>Then he went out again.</t3619>
<t3620>I'll say that the tray fell when I was leaving, he announced.</t3620>
<t3621>I liked that she was willing to lie for me, even in something so insignificant, even if it was for her own benefit.</t3621> <t3622>It was a way to be united.</t3622>
<t3623>I smiled at her.</t3623> <t3624>I hope no one heard you, I said to her.</t3624>
<t3625>I got quite a scare, he said, stopping at the entrance with the tray in his hand.</t3625> <t3626>At first, I thought it was just your clothes.</t3626> <t3627>Then I said to myself, what are her clothes doing on the floor?</t3627> <t3628>I thought that maybe you had...</t3628>
<t3629>Fugitive, I added.</t3629>
<t3630>Well, almost, he admitted.</t3630> <t3631>But it was you.</t3631>
<t3632>Yes, I affirmed.</t3632> <t3633>It was.</t3633>
<t3634>And it was, and she went out with the tray and came back with a cloth to clean up the rest of the orange juice, and that afternoon Rita made a grumpy comment about how some people were clumsy.</t3634> <t3635>They have too many things on their minds, they don't watch where they're going, she complained, and we carried on as if nothing had happened.</t3635>
<t3636>This happened in May.</t3636> <t3637>Now spring has passed, the tulips have stopped blooming and are starting to lose their petals one by one, as if they were teeth.</t3637> <t3638>One day I stumbled upon Serena Joy, who was in the garden, kneeling on a cushion, with her cane beside her on the grass.</t3638> <t3639>She was cutting the buds with a pair of scissors.</t3639> <t3640>I was carrying my basket with oranges and lamb chops, and as I passed by, I glanced at her sideways.</t3640> <t3641>She was focused, adjusting the blades of the scissors, and when she cut, she did so with a convulsive spasm of her hands.</t3641> <t3642>Could it be arthritis taking over her hands?</t3642>
<t3643>Or a blitzkrieg, a kamikaze launching itself onto the swollen genital organs of the flowers?</t3643> <t3644>The fruiting body.</t3644> <t3645>By cutting the buds, the bulb accumulates energy.</t3645>
<t3646>Saint Serena, kneeling, doing penance.</t3646>
<t3647>I often amuse myself this way, with spiteful and bitter jokes about her; but not for long.</t3647> <t3648>It's not convenient to waste time looking at Serena Joy from behind.</t3648>
<t3649>What I was looking at greedily were the scissors.</t3649>
<t3650>Good.</t3650> <t3651>Additionally, we had the irises, which grow beautifully and freshly on their long stems, like blown glass, like a watercolor momentarily frozen in a stain, light blue, light mauve, and the darker ones, velvety and purplish, like the ears of a black cat illuminated by the sun, an indigo shadow, and those with a bloody center, of such feminine shapes that it was surprising that once picked they did not last.</t3651> <t3652>There is something subversive in Serena's garden, a sense of things buried that burst upwards, silently, under the light, as if pointing and saying: That which is silenced will cry out to be heard, even if silently.</t3652>
<t3653>A Tennyson garden, imbued with fragrance, languid; the return of the word fading.</t3653> <t3654>The sunlight pours over it, it's true, but the heat emanates from the flowers themselves, you can feel it: it's like holding your hand a centimeter above an arm or a shoulder.</t3654> <t3655>It emits heat, and it also receives it.</t3655> <t3656>Walking through this garden of peonies, carnations, and pinks on a day like today makes my head spin.</t3656>
<t3657>The willow displays abundant foliage and lets its insinuating whisper be heard.</t3657> <t3658>Quote, it says, terraces; the whistles run down my spine, like a shiver caused by fever.</t3658> <t3659>The summer dress brushes the skin of my thighs, the grass grows under my feet and out of the corner of my eye I see something moving in the branches; feathers, a fluttering, graceful sounds, the tree inside the bird, the metamorphosis runs wild.</t3659>
<t3660>It is possible that goddesses exist, and the air becomes imbued with desire.</t3660> <t3661>Even the bricks of the house soften and become tactile; if I lean against them, they will become warm and flexible.</t3661> <t3662>It is surprising what a denial can achieve.</t3662>
<t3663>Did the fact that he saw my ankle yesterday at the checkpoint, when I dropped my pass for him to pick up, make him dizzy and faint?</t3663> <t3664>No handkerchiefs or fans, I use what I have at hand.</t3664>
<t3665>Winter is not so dangerous.</t3665> <t3666>I need the insensitivity, the cold, the rigidity; not this heaviness, as if I were a melon on a stem, this liquid maturity.</t3666>
<t3667>The Commander and I have an agreement.</t3667> <t3668>It is not the first of its kind in history, although the form it is taking is not usual.</t3668>
<t3669>I visit the Commander two or three times a week, always after dinner, but only when I receive the signal.</t3669> <t3670>And the signal is Nick.</t3670> <t3671>If when I go out to do the shopping, or when I return, he is polishing the car, and his cap is tilted or not properly worn, then I go to the meeting.</t3671> <t3672>If he is not there, or his cap is properly worn, I stay in my room, as usual.</t3672> <t3673>Of course, none of this applies during Ceremony nights.</t3673>
<t3674>As always, the difficulty is the Wife.</t3674> <t3675>After dinner, she goes to their bedroom, from where she could hear me while I sneak down the hallway, though I am careful not to make any noise.</t3675> <t3676>Or she stays in the living room, knitting one of her endless scarves for the Angels, crafting meters and meters of intricate and useless woolen people: it must be her way of procreating.</t3676>
<t3677>Normally, when he is in the living room, the door is left ajar, so I do not dare to pass by it.</t3677> <t3678>If I have received the signal but cannot go down the stairs or pass by the living room door, the Commander understands.</t3678> <t3679>He, better than anyone, knows my situation.</t3679> <t3680>He knows all the rules.</t3680>
<t3681>However, sometimes Serena Joy is out, visiting a sick Wife; it is the only place she could go alone, at night.</t3681> <t3682>She takes food, for example a cake, or a pastry, or a loaf of bread kneaded by Rita, or a jar of jelly made with the mint leaves that grow in her garden.</t3682> <t3683>The Commanders' Wives often get sick; this adds interest to their lives.</t3683> <t3684>As for us, the Handmaids and even the Marthas, we avoid illness.</t3684> <t3685>The Marthas do not want to be forced to retire because who knows where they would go?</t3685> <t3686>There are not many old women around anymore.</t3686> <t3687>And</t3687>
<t3688>as for us, any real illness, anything chronic or debilitating, a loss of weight or appetite, hair loss, a gland failure, would be decisive.</t3688> <t3689>I remember that at the beginning of spring, Cora was running around the house despite the flu, and she would hold onto the doors when she thought no one was watching, making efforts not to cough.</t3689> <t3690>When Serena asked her what was wrong, she said it was just a slight cold.</t3690>
<t3691>Serena herself sometimes takes a few days off and stays in bed.</t3691>
<t3692>Then it is she who receives visits; the other Wives noisily climb the stairs and chatter cheerfully; she receives the pies and cakes, the jelly and the bouquets of flowers from the gardens of the others.</t3692>
<t3693>They take turns.</t3693> <t3694>There is a kind of invisible and tacit list.</t3694> <t3695>Each one is careful not to monopolize attention more than what is appropriate.</t3695>
<t3696>On the nights when it is certain that Serena will go out, I am sure that I will be summoned.</t3696>
<t3697>The first time I was confused.</t3697> <t3698>His needs were unknown to me, and what I could receive in return seemed ridiculous, laughable, like a fetish for tying shoes.</t3698>
<t3699>There had also been a kind of disappointment.</t3699> <t3700>What was I expecting the first time, behind the closed door?</t3700> <t3701>Something indescribable, perhaps positions on all fours, perversions, whippings, mutilations?</t3701> <t3702>At the very least, some minor sexual manipulation, some past sin that was now denied to him, forbidden by law and punishable by amputation.</t3702> <t3703>Instead, the fact that he asked me to play Intelect, as if we were an elderly couple or a pair of children, seemed extremely strange to me, in its own way also a violation.</t3703> <t3704>As a request, it was obtuse.</t3704>
<t3705>So when I left the room, I still wasn't clear on what he wanted, or why, or if I could fulfill any of it.</t3705> <t3706>When it comes to business, the terms of the exchange must be stated.</t3706> <t3707>Certainly, this was something he had not done.</t3707> <t3708>I thought he was playing cat and mouse, but now I believe that his motives and desires were not obvious even to himself.</t3708> <t3709>They had not yet reached the verbal level.</t3709>
<t3710>The second night started just like the first.</t3710> <t3711>I went to his door —which was closed—, knocked, and he told me to come in.</t3711> <t3712>Then followed the two games with the soft beige-colored pieces.</t3712> <t3713>Neat, quartz, doorjamb, sylph, rhythm, all the old tricks I could imagine or remember to use the consonants.</t3713> <t3714>My tongue felt heavy from the effort of spelling.</t3714> <t3715>It was like using a language I once knew but had almost forgotten, a language related to customs that disappeared long ago: café au lait on a terrace, with a brioche, absinthe served in a tall glass or shrimp in a paper cone; things I had read about but never seen.</t3715> <t3716>It was like trying to walk without crutches, like those fake fights in old television movies.</t3716> <t3717>You can do it.</t3717> <t3718>I know you can.</t3718> <t3719>Thus my mind staggered and stumbled among the angular r's and t's, sliding over the ovoid vowels as if over pebbles.</t3719>
<t3720>The Commander was patient when I hesitated or asked him what the correct spelling of a word was.</t3720> <t3721>We always have time to consult the dictionary, he said.</t3721> <t3722>He said we can.</t3722> <t3723>I realized that the first time he had let me win.</t3723>
<t3724>I hoped that everything would be the same that night, including the goodnight kiss.</t3724> <t3725>But when we finished the game, he leaned back in the chair.</t3725> <t3726>He rested his elbows on the arms of the chair, brought the tips of his fingers together, and looked at me.</t3726>
<t3727>I have a small gift for you, he announced.</t3727>
<t3728>He smiled slightly.</t3728> <t3729>Then he opened the top drawer of his desk and took something out.</t3729> <t3730>He held it in his hands for a moment, as if deciding whether to give it to me or not.</t3730> <t3731>Although from where I was I saw it upside down, I recognized it immediately.</t3731> <t3732>At one time, they had been very common.</t3732> <t3733>It was a magazine, a women's magazine, as I deduced from the photo on the glossy paper: a model with teased hair, a scarf wrapped around her neck, painted lips; fall fashion.</t3733> <t3734>I thought all those magazines had been destroyed, but there was one left and it was here, in the Commander's private office, where you least expected to find something like that.</t3734> <t3735>He looked at the model, who was facing him; he was still smiling, with that melancholic smile that characterized him.</t3735> <t3736>His gaze was the same as one would give to a zoo animal whose species is almost extinct.</t3736>
<t3737>I fixed my gaze on the magazine, while he swung it in front of me as if it were a lure, and I desired it.</t3737> <t3738>I desired it so intensely that I felt pain in my fingertips.</t3738> <t3739>At the same time, my longing seemed frivolous and absurd because in the past I had taken this type of magazine quite lightly.</t3739> <t3740>I would read them in the dentist's office and sometimes on planes; I would buy them to take to hotel rooms, as a way to fill the free time while waiting for Luke.</t3740> <t3741>Once I had flipped through them, I would throw them away, because they were absolutely disposable, and one or two days later I was unable to remember what I had read in them.</t3741>
<t3742>However, at that moment I remembered it.</t3742> <t3743>What was in them was a promise.</t3743> <t3744>They traded in transformation; they suggested an endless series of possibilities extending like an image in two facing mirrors, multiplying, replica after replica until disappearing.</t3744> <t3745>They suggested one adventure after another, one wardrobe after another, one reform after another, one man after another.</t3745> <t3746>They suggested rejuvenation, the defeat and overcoming of pain, infinite love.</t3746> <t3747>The true promise they held was immortality.</t3747>
<t3748>This was what he was holding in his hands, without knowing it.</t3748> <t3749>He quickly flipped through the pages, and I noticed that I was leaning forward.</t3749>
<t3750>It's old, he commented, a kind of curiosity.</t3750> <t3751>From the seventies, I think.</t3751>
<t3752>It's a Vogue, he said like a wine expert dropping a name.</t3752> <t3753>I thought you might like to look at it.</t3753>
<t3754>I leaned back.</t3754> <t3755>He could be subjecting me to a test to see how deeply the indoctrination had taken hold in me.</t3755> <t3756>It is not allowed, I replied.</t3756>
<t3757>Here, yes, he said serenely.</t3757> <t3758>I understood immediately.</t3758> <t3759>If the main taboo had been broken, why hesitate before a less important one?</t3759> <t3760>And before another, and another.</t3760> <t3761>Who could know where they would end?</t3761> <t3762>Behind this door, the taboo was banished.</t3762>
<t3763>I took the magazine from her hands and turned it over.</t3763> <t3764>Here they were, once again, the images of my childhood: bold, overwhelming, self-assured, with arms open as if demanding space, with legs spread and feet firmly planted on the ground.</t3764> <t3765>There was something of the Renaissance in the pose, but I thought of princes and not maidens with coifs and curls.</t3765> <t3766>Those sincere eyes, shaded with makeup, yes, but just like the eyes of cats, fixed and waiting for the moment to pounce.</t3766> <t3767>Without retreating or clinging, not with those layers and those coarse tweed suits and those knee-high boots.</t3767> <t3768>Those women were like pirates, with their elegant purses to store the loot and their horse-like, greedy teeth.</t3768>
<t3769>I noticed that the Commander was watching me while I turned the pages.</t3769> <t3770>I knew I was doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing, and that it gave him pleasure to watch me do it.</t3770> <t3771>I should have felt perverse; in Aunt Lydia's eyes, I was a pervert.</t3771> <t3772>But I didn't feel that way.</t3772> <t3773>On the contrary, I felt like an old Edwardian seaside postcard: daring.</t3773> <t3774>What would he give me next?</t3774> <t3775>A corset?</t3775>
<t3776>Why the guard?, I asked him.</t3776>
<t3777>Some of us, he explained, still appreciate old things.</t3777>
<t3778>But these were supposed to have been burned, I argued.</t3778> <t3779>House-to-house searches were conducted, bonfires...</t3779>
<t3780>What represents a danger in the hands of the masses, he continued, something that in some cases has been an irony, and in others not, is safe in the hands of those whose motives are...</t3780>
<t3781>Impeccable, I concluded.</t3781>
<t3782>He nodded with a serious expression.</t3782> <t3783>It was impossible to tell if he was serious or not.</t3783>
<t3784>But why are you showing it to me? I asked, and immediately felt stupid.</t3784> <t3785>What could he answer me?</t3785> <t3786>That he was having fun at my expense?</t3786> <t3787>Because he must have known how painful it was for me to remember the past.</t3787>
<t3788>I was not prepared for what he actually answered.</t3788> <t3789>To whom else could I show it?, he said to me, once again showing an expression of sadness.</t3789>
<t3790>What if I went further?, I thought.</t3790> <t3791>I didn't want to rush him or pressure him.</t3791> <t3792>I knew I was dispensable.</t3792> <t3793>However, I asked him very softly: And your wife?</t3793>
<t3794>He seemed to reflect.</t3794> <t3795>No, he said.</t3795> <t3796>She wouldn't understand.</t3796> <t3797>Anyway, she doesn't talk to me much anymore.</t3797> <t3798>It seems like we don't have much in common now.</t3798>
<t3799>He had said it, he had revealed what he thought: his wife did not understand him.</t3799>
<t3800>So I was there for that reason.</t3800> <t3801>The same as always.</t3801> <t3802>Too trivial to be true.</t3802>
<t3803>The third night I asked her for some hand lotion.</t3803> <t3804>I didn't want to seem like a beggar, but I needed to know what I could get.</t3804>
<t3805>A little bit of what?, he asked me kindly, as usual.</t3805> <t3806>He was in front of me, on the other side of the desk.</t3806> <t3807>He never touched me much, except for the obligatory kiss.</t3807> <t3808>No groping, no panting, none of that; it would have been out of place, in a sense, both for him and for me.</t3808>
<t3809>Hand lotion, I repeated.</t3809> <t3810>Or for the face.</t3810> <t3811>Our skin gets very dry.</t3811> <t3812>For some reason, I said "our" instead of "my".</t3812> <t3813>I would have liked to also ask him for some bath salts, the kind you used to get before, that looked like small colored balloons, and that seemed so magical to me when I saw them at home, in the round glass bowl my mother had in the bathroom.</t3813> <t3814>But I thought he wouldn't know what I was talking about.</t3814> <t3815>Anyway, they probably didn't make them anymore.</t3815>
<t3816>Does it dry out?, asked the Commander, as if he had never thought about it.</t3816>
<t3817>And what are you doing to remedy it?</t3817>
<t3818>We use butter, I explained to him.</t3818> <t3819>When we get it.</t3819> <t3820>Or margarine.</t3820> <t3821>Most of the time it's margarine.</t3821>
<t3822>Butter, he repeated in a reflective tone.</t3822> <t3823>A very intelligent idea.</t3823> <t3824>Butter.</t3824> <t3825>And</t3825>
<t3826>started laughing.</t3826>
<t3827>I felt the urge to slap him.</t3827>
<t3828>I think I could get some, he commented, like someone indulging a child asking for bubble gum.</t3828> <t3829>But she might notice the smell.</t3829>
<t3830>I wondered if this fear was based on some past experience.</t3830> <t3831>A long time ago: lipstick on the collar of the shirt, perfume on the cuffs, a scene late at night, in the kitchen or in the bedroom.</t3831> <t3832>A man who had not lived such an experience would not think of that.</t3832> <t3833>Unless he was more astute than he seemed.</t3833>
<t3834>I will be careful, I assured her.</t3834> <t3835>Besides, she is never that close to me.</t3835>
<t3836>Sometimes, yes, he clarified.</t3836>
<t3837>I lowered my gaze.</t3837> <t3838>I had forgotten.</t3838> <t3839>I felt myself blush.</t3839> <t3840>I won't use it those nights, I told her.</t3840>
<t3841>The fourth night brought me the hand lotion in an unlabelled plastic bottle.</t3841>
<t3842>It wasn't of very good quality, it smelled slightly of vegetable oil.</t3842> <t3843>For me, the Lily of the Valley did not exist.</t3843> <t3844>This lotion must have been something they made to use in hospitals, to heal sores.</t3844> <t3845>But I thanked him anyway.</t3845>
<t3846>The problem, I told him, is that I have nowhere to store it.</t3846>
<t3847>In your room, he said, as if it were obvious.</t3847>
<t3848>They would find her, I replied.</t3848> <t3849>Someone would find her.</t3849>
<t3850>"Why?" he asked, as if he really didn't know.</t3850> <t3851>And maybe he didn't know.</t3851> <t3852>It wasn't the first time he had shown signs of truly being unaware of the real conditions in which we lived.</t3852>
<t3853>They check us, I explained.</t3853> <t3854>They check our rooms.</t3854>
<t3855>What for?, he asked me.</t3855>
<t3856>I think at that moment I slightly lost my temper.</t3856> <t3857>Razor blades, I snapped.</t3857> <t3858>Books, writings, things from the black market.</t3858> <t3859>Any of the things we shouldn't have.</t3859> <t3860>Jesus Christ, you should know that.</t3860> <t3861>My voice sounded angrier than I wanted, but he didn't even blink.</t3861>
<t3862>Then you'll have to keep it here, he concluded.</t3862>
<t3863>And that's what I did.</t3863>
<t3864>While I spread the lotion on my hands and then on my face, he looked at me with the same expression as someone looking through bars.</t3864> <t3865>I wanted to turn my back to him—it was as if he were with me in the bathroom—but I didn't dare.</t3865>
<t3866>For him, I must remember, I am only a whim.</t3866>
<t3867>CHAPTER 26</t3867>
<t3868>Two or three weeks later, when the night of the Ceremony arrived, I had the impression that things were different.</t3868> <t3869>There was an uneasiness that had never existed before.</t3869> <t3870>Before, I considered it a job, an unpleasant job that had to be done as quickly as possible to get it over with.</t3870> <t3871>Desensitize yourself, my mother used to say before the exams I didn't want to take, or the cold water baths.</t3871> <t3872>At that moment, I didn't think much about what the phrase meant, but it had something to do with metal, with armor, and that's what I should do, I should desensitize myself.</t3872> <t3873>I will pretend not to be present, that my body is not present.</t3873>
<t3874>I knew that this state of absence, of existing separate from the body, was also true in the case of the Commander.</t3874> <t3875>He was probably thinking about other things when he was with me; with us, because of course Serena Joy was also there those nights.</t3875> <t3876>He must have been thinking about what he had done during the day, or about the golf games, or about what he had eaten for dinner.</t3876> <t3877>The sexual act—although he performed it in a mechanical way—must have been, for him, largely unconscious, like scratching himself.</t3877>
<t3878>But that night, the first after this new agreement between us —</t3878>
<t3879>whatever it was, I didn't know what to call it—I felt ashamed of him.</t3879> <t3880>The first thing I felt was that he was really looking at me, and I didn't like it.</t3880> <t3881>The lights were on as usual—since Serena Joy always nullified anything that could have created an aura of romance or eroticism—but they were dim: lights above our heads, lights that were annoying despite the canopy.</t3881> <t3882>It was like being on an operating table under a dazzling spotlight; like being on a stage.</t3882> <t3883>I was aware that my legs were covered in hair, with that scattered hair that grows on legs that have already been shaved.</t3883> <t3884>I was also aware of the hair in my armpits, although of course he couldn't see it.</t3884> <t3885>The act of copulation, perhaps fertilization—which for me should have been no more than what a bee is to a flower—had become, in my view, something indecorous, an impropriety that I had never felt before.</t3885>
<t3886>He was no longer a thing to me.</t3886> <t3887>Therein lay the problem.</t3887> <t3888>I realized it that night, and this understanding has not left me.</t3888> <t3889>Things are getting complicated.</t3889>
<t3890>Serena Joy has also changed for me.</t3890> <t3891>Before, I simply hated her for her participation in what they did to me; and because she also hated me and resented my presence, and because she would be the one to raise my child, if I was able to have one.</t3891> <t3892>But at that moment, although I hated her —no more than when she squeezed my hands so hard that her rings pinched my skin, and at the same time held them, which she must have done on purpose to make me feel as uncomfortable as she did—, I no longer felt a pure and simple hatred for her.</t3892> <t3893>In part, I felt jealous of her; but, how could I be jealous of a woman so obviously withered and miserable?</t3893> <t3894>One can only feel jealous of a person who has something that should belong to oneself.</t3894> <t3895>Anyway, I was jealous.</t3895>
<t3896>But I also felt guilty about her.</t3896> <t3897>I felt like an intruder invading a territory that should have been hers.</t3897> <t3898>Now that I was seeing the Commander in secret, even if it was just to play his games and hear him talk, our roles were no longer as different as they should have been in theory.</t3898> <t3899>Even if she didn't know it, I was taking something from her.</t3899> <t3900>I was stealing.</t3900> <t3901>It didn't matter that it was something she apparently didn't want or need, or even rejected; it was still hers, and if I took it from her, if I took this mysterious thing that I find impossible to define—because the Commander wasn't in love with me, I refused to believe he felt something so extreme for me—what would she have left?</t3901>
<t3902>Why should I worry?, I said to myself.</t3902> <t3903>She means nothing to me, she doesn't like me, if she could come up with some excuse, she would throw me out of this house immediately.</t3903> <t3904>If she found out, for example.</t3904> <t3905>He wouldn't be in a position to intervene to save me; the transgressions of the women of the house —whether a Martha or a Handmaid— are solely under the jurisdiction of the Wives.</t3905> <t3906>I knew she was a malicious and vengeful woman.</t3906> <t3907>However, I couldn't rid myself of this small remorse regarding her.</t3907>
<t3908>Moreover, although Serena Joy did not know it, I had a certain power over her.</t3908> <t3909>And</t3909>
<t3910>He enjoyed it.</t3910> <t3911>Why pretend?</t3911> <t3912>He enjoyed it immensely.</t3912>
<t3913>But the Commander could have discovered me very easily, with a look, a gesture, some small slip that revealed there was something between us.</t3913> <t3914>He almost did it the night of the Ceremony.</t3914> <t3915>He reached out his hand as if to touch my face; I moved my head to one side, hoping that Serena Joy hadn't noticed, and he withdrew his hand and focused on his thoughts and his inner journey.</t3915>
<t3916>Don't do it again, I told him when we met again alone.</t3916>
<t3917>What to do?, he asked.</t3917>
<t3918>Trying to touch me like that when we are... when she is there.</t3918>
<t3919>Did I do that?, he was astonished.</t3919>
<t3920>I could arrange to be transferred, I told him.</t3920> <t3921>To the Colonies, you know, or something worse.</t3921>
<t3922>I thought that in front of others, he would continue to act as if I were a huge vase, or a window: part of the decor, inanimate or transparent.</t3922>
<t3923>I'm sorry, he apologized.</t3923> <t3924>It wasn't my intention.</t3924> <t3925>But I find it...</t3925>
<t3926>What? I urged him to finish the sentence.</t3926>
<t3927>Impersonal, he stated.</t3927>
<t3928>And now you discover it?, I asked him.</t3928> <t3929>From the way I spoke, you might have noticed that our relationship had already changed.</t3929>
<t3930>For future generations, said Aunt Lydia, everything will be easier.</t3930> <t3931>Women will live together and in harmony, forming a single family.</t3931> <t3932>For them, you will be like daughters, and when the population level has stabilized again, we won't have to move you from one house to another, because you will be sufficient.</t3932> <t3933>Under such conditions, true emotional bonds can be created, she said, winking at us slyly.</t3933>
<t3934>The women will be united by a single goal!</t3934> <t3935>They will help each other in daily chores while they walk together on the path of life, each fulfilling the task assigned to her.</t3935> <t3936>Why let one woman bear all the tasks necessary for the proper management of a household?</t3936> <t3937>It is neither reasonable nor humane.</t3937> <t3938>Your daughters will enjoy greater freedom.</t3938> <t3939>We are fighting to be able to give each one of you a small garden, to each one of you —</t3939>
<t3940>he would clasp his hands together again and lower his voice—, and that's just one example.</t3940> <t3941>He would raise his finger and wave it in front of our noses.</t3941> <t3942>But until this can be achieved, we cannot behave like gluttons and ask for too much, don't you think?</t3942>
<t3943>The reality is that I am his lover.</t3943> <t3944>Men of high society have always had lovers, why would it be different now?</t3944> <t3945>The arrangements are not exactly the same, of course.</t3945> <t3946>Before, lovers used to live in a smaller house, or in an apartment of their own, but now things have merged.</t3946> <t3947>Although deep down it is the same, more or less.</t3947> <t3948>In some countries, they were called independent women.</t3948> <t3949>I am an independent woman.</t3949> <t3950>My job consists of providing what, otherwise, is lacking.</t3950> <t3951>Even the Intellect.</t3951> <t3952>It is an absurd and, at the same time, ignominious situation.</t3952>
<t3953>Sometimes I think she knows.</t3953> <t3954>Sometimes it occurs to me that they are in collusion.</t3954> <t3955>Sometimes I believe that she incites him to this, and that she laughs at me; just as I, from time to time, laugh at myself with a certain irony.</t3955> <t3956>Let her carry the heaviest load, she must say to herself.</t3956> <t3957>Perhaps she has almost completely distanced herself from him; perhaps this is her version of freedom.</t3957>
<t3958>But even so, and in a rather stupid way, I am happier than before.</t3958> <t3959>First of all, it is something that can be done.</t3959> <t3960>Something to fill the time in the evenings, instead of sitting alone in my room.</t3960> <t3961>It is something else to think about.</t3961> <t3962>I don't love the Commander, or anything like that, but he interests me, occupies a space, is something more than a shadow.</t3962>
<t3963>And I to him.</t3963> <t3964>To him, I am no longer just a usable body.</t3964> <t3965>To him, I am not simply an empty vessel, a chalice without wine, an oven —that doesn't bake— missing its loaves.</t3965> <t3966>To him, I am not simply empty.</t3966>
<t3967>CHAPTER 27</t3967>
<t3968>I walk down the street with Deglen, under the sun.</t3968> <t3969>It's hot and humid.</t3969> <t3970>Before, at this time of year, we would have worn a beach suit and sandals.</t3970> <t3971>In our baskets, we carry strawberries —now is the season, so we will eat strawberries and more strawberries until we are full— and canned fish.</t3971> <t3972>We bought the fish at Panes y Peces, which also has a wooden sign with the drawing of a smiling fish with eyelashes.</t3972> <t3973>However, they don't sell bread.</t3973> <t3974>Most families bake their own bread, although, when they run out, at El Pan de Cada Día you can get dry rolls and stale fritters.</t3974> <t3975>Panes y Peces is almost never open.</t3975> <t3976>Why bother opening if they have nothing to sell?</t3976> <t3977>Marine fishing ceased to exist years ago; the little fish that is available now comes from fish farms, and it tastes like mud.</t3977>
<t3978>The news says that the coastal areas are "at rest."</t3978> <t3979>I remember the flounder, the pollock, the swordfish, the scallops, the tuna; and the baked stuffed lobster, and the salmon, pink and fatty, grilled.</t3979> <t3980>Is it possible that they have all gone extinct, just like the whales?</t3980> <t3981>I heard that rumor, it was conveyed to me with silent words, with a barely perceptible movement of the lips, while we were outside in line, waiting for the store to open, in whose window display there was a drawing of some succulent white fish fillets.</t3981> <t3982>When they have something, they put the drawing in the window display; if not, they remove it.</t3982> <t3983>A language of signals.</t3983>
<t3984>Today, Deglen and I walked slowly; we are hot in our long dresses, our armpits are sweating, and we are tired.</t3984> <t3985>At least in this heat, we are not wearing gloves.</t3985> <t3986>At some point on this block, there was an ice cream shop.</t3986> <t3987>I can't remember the name.</t3987> <t3988>Things can change so quickly, buildings can be demolished or transformed into something else, and it becomes difficult to remember them as they were.</t3988> <t3989>You could get double cones, and if you wanted, they would sprinkle chocolate shavings on top.</t3989> <t3990>They had a man's name, Johnnies? Jackies?</t3990> <t3991>I can't remember it.</t3991>
<t3992>We used to go when she was little, and I would lift her up in my arms so she could see over the glass counter, where the tubs of softly colored ice creams were displayed: pale orange, pale green, pale pink, and I would read the names to her so she could choose.</t3992> <t3993>Anyway, she didn't choose them by the name, but by the color.</t3993> <t3994>Her dresses and smocks were also in those colors.</t3994> <t3995>Pastel ice creams.</t3995>
<t3996>Jimmies, that's what they were called.</t3996>
<t3997>Now, Deglen and I feel more comfortable, we have gotten used to being together.</t3997> <t3998>Like Siamese twins.</t3998> <t3999>We no longer bother with the formalities of greeting; we smile and set off, in tandem, serenely following our daily route.</t3999> <t4000>From time to time we vary the itinerary; there is nothing that prohibits it, as long as we stay within the boundary of the barriers.</t4000> <t4001>A rat inside a maze is free to go anywhere, as long as it stays within the maze.</t4001>
<t4002>We have already gone to the shops and to the church; now we are in front of the Wall.</t4002> <t4003>Today there is nothing, in summer they don't leave the corpses hanging as long as in winter, because of the flies and the smell.</t4003> <t4004>At another time this was the kingdom of air fresheners, Pine and Floral, and people retain their fondness for them; especially the Commanders, who advocate for the purity of all things.</t4004>
<t4005>—Do you have everything on your list? —Deglen asks me, even though he knows I do.</t4005>
<t4006>Our lists are never long.</t4006> <t4007>She has abandoned her passivity from the early days, part of her melancholy.</t4007> <t4008>Often, it is she who initiates the conversation.</t4008>
<t4009>—Yes —I respond.</t4009>
<t4010>—Then let's take a walk —he suggests.</t4010> <t4011>He means that we should go down to the river.</t4011>
<t4012>It's been a while since we went there.</t4012>
<t4013>—Fantastic —I say.</t4013> <t4014>However, I don't turn around immediately but stay where I am, taking one last look at the Wall.</t4014> <t4015>There are the red bricks, the spotlights, the barbed wire, the hooks.</t4015> <t4016>In some way, the Wall seems even more ominous when it is empty, like today.</t4016> <t4017>When there is someone hanging, at least you know the worst.</t4017> <t4018>But empty, it is also something in potential, like an approaching storm.</t4018> <t4019>When I see the bodies, the real bodies, when I manage to guess by the sizes and shapes that none of them is Luke, I can also think that he is still alive.</t4019>
<t4020>I don't know why I expect to see him on this wall.</t4020> <t4021>There are hundreds of different places where they could have killed him.</t4021> <t4022>But I can't get the idea out of my head that at this moment he is there, behind the empty red bricks.</t4022>
<t4023>I try to imagine which building he is in.</t4023> <t4024>I remember the layout of the buildings, on the other side of the Wall; before, when it was a university, we could walk freely inside.</t4024> <t4025>We still go in, occasionally, for the Women's Salvations.</t4025> <t4026>Most of the buildings are also made of red bricks; some have arched doors, a nineteenth-century Romanesque effect.</t4026> <t4027>They no longer allow us to enter the buildings, but who cares about going in?</t4027> <t4028>They belong to the Eyes.</t4028>
<t4029>Maybe it is in the Library.</t4029> <t4030>Somewhere in the vaults.</t4030> <t4031>On the shelves.</t4031>
<t4032>The Library is like a temple.</t4032> <t4033>There is a long white staircase that leads to the row of doors.</t4033> <t4034>Inside, another white staircase.</t4034> <t4035>On both sides of this, on the wall, there are angels.</t4035> <t4036>There are also some men fighting, or about to fight, looking clean and noble and not dirty, bloodied, and smelly, as they should have appeared.</t4036> <t4037>On one side of the inner door, Victory is seen, guiding them, and on the other side, Death.</t4037> <t4038>It is a mural in honor of some war.</t4038> <t4039>The men who are next to Death are still alive.</t4039> <t4040>They are going to Heaven.</t4040> <t4041>Death is a beautiful woman with wings and an almost bare chest.</t4041> <t4042>Or is that Victory?</t4042> <t4043>I don't remember.</t4043>
<t4044>They did not want to destroy this.</t4044>
<t4045>We turned our backs to the Wall and walked to the left.</t4045> <t4046>Here there are several empty warehouses with the windows of the storefronts scribbled with soap.</t4046>
<t4047>I try to remember what they used to sell in the past.</t4047> <t4048>Cosmetics? Jewelry?</t4048> <t4049>Most of the stores that sold men's items are still open; only those that sold what they call vanities have been closed.</t4049>
<t4050>On the corner, there is a store called Spiritual Scrolls.</t4050> <t4051>It is a sanctuary: there are Spiritual Scrolls in the center of every city, in every suburb, or so they say.</t4051> <t4052>They must make substantial profits.</t4052>
<t4053>The display window of Spiritual Scrolls is made of shatterproof glass.</t4053> <t4054>Behind it, rows and rows of printing machines can be seen; these machines are known by the name Sacred Scrolls, but only among us, because it is a disrespectful name, a nickname.</t4054> <t4055>What the machines print are prayers, scrolls and more scrolls that never stop coming out.</t4055> <t4056>Orders are placed via Compufone; one day, by chance, I heard the Commander's Wife doing it.</t4056> <t4057>The act of ordering prayers from Spiritual Scrolls is a display of piety and loyalty to the regime; so, naturally, the Commanders' Wives do it very often.</t4057> <t4058>This supports their husbands' careers.</t4058>
<t4059>There are five different types of prayers: for health, wealth, a death, a birth, a sin.</t4059> <t4060>You choose the one you want, press your own number so that your account is charged, and press the number of copies you want of the prayer.</t4060>
<t4061>While the prayers are being printed, the machines speak; if you want, you can enter and listen to their expressionless and metallic voices repeating the same chant over and over again.</t4061> <t4062>When the prayers have been spoken and printed, another paper is rolled into the slot and the cycle begins again.</t4062> <t4063>Inside the building, there is no one: the machines operate on their own.</t4063> <t4064>From outside, you cannot hear the voices; you only hear a murmur, a hum, like that of a devout kneeling crowd.</t4064> <t4065>Each machine has a golden eye painted on its side, flanked by two small golden wings.</t4065>
<t4066>I try to remember what they sold here when this was a store, before it became Spiritual Scrolls.</t4066> <t4067>I think it was a lingerie shop.</t4067> <t4068>Pink and silver cases, colorful stockings, lace bras, silk scarves?</t4068> <t4069>Everything has been lost.</t4069>
<t4070>Deglen and I stop at Spiritual Scrolls; we look at the shatterproof glass display, we observe the prayers that emerge from the machines and disappear again through the slot, back to the realm of the unnamed.</t4070>
<t4071>I look away.</t4071> <t4072>What I see are not the machines but Deglen, reflected in the shop window glass.</t4072> <t4073>She stares at me intently.</t4073>
<t4074>We are looking into each other's eyes.</t4074> <t4075>It's the first time I look directly into Deglen's eyes, holding the gaze, not from the corner of my eye.</t4075> <t4076>His face is oval, pink, filled out without being fat, and his eyes are round.</t4076>
<t4077>Look into my eyes in the glass, penetratingly and firmly.</t4077> <t4078>Now it is difficult to look away.</t4078> <t4079>This vision gives me a certain startle.</t4079> <t4080>It's like seeing someone naked for the first time.</t4080> <t4081>Suddenly, a danger that did not exist before installs itself between us.</t4081> <t4082>Even the act of looking into each other's eyes poses a risk.</t4082> <t4083>However, there is no one near us.</t4083>
<t4084>Finally, Deglen breaks the silence.</t4084>
<t4085>—Do you think God hears these machines? —he asks in a whisper, as we used to do in the Center.</t4085>
<t4086>In the past, this observation would have been quite trivial, a kind of scholarly speculation.</t4086> <t4087>At this moment, it is a betrayal.</t4087>
<t4088>I could start screaming.</t4088> <t4089>I could run away.</t4089> <t4090>I could quietly move away from her, show her that I will not tolerate this kind of conversation in my presence.</t4090> <t4091>Subversion, sedition, blasphemy, heresy, all in one.</t4091>
<t4092>I become desensitized.</t4092>
<t4093>—No —I reply.</t4093>
<t4094>She lets out a sigh, a long sigh of relief.</t4094> <t4095>We have crossed an invisible boundary together.</t4095>
<t4096>—Me neither —he/she states.</t4096>
<t4097>—Anyway, I suppose it's a kind of faith —I commented—.</t4097> <t4098>Like the Tibetan prayer wheels.</t4098>
<t4099>—What is that? —he asks.</t4099>
<t4100>—I only know what I've read —I explained—.</t4100> <t4101>They operated powered by the wind.</t4101> <t4102>They no longer exist.</t4102>
<t4103>—Just like everything else —he replies.</t4103> <t4104>Only now do we stop looking at each other.</t4104>
<t4105>—Is this place safe? —I whisper.</t4105>
<t4106>—I suppose it is the safest —he says—.</t4106> <t4107>It's as if we were praying, that's all.</t4107>
<t4108>—And what do you say about them?</t4108>
<t4109>—Them? —he asks, still in a whisper—.</t4109> <t4110>The street is always safer, there are no bugs, and besides, why would they put one right here?</t4110> <t4111>They must think no one would dare.</t4111> <t4112>But we've been here too long already.</t4112> <t4113>It doesn't make sense to be late —we turn at the same time—.</t4113> <t4114>Keep your head down while we walk —he instructs me—, and lean a bit towards me.</t4114> <t4115>That way I can hear you better.</t4115> <t4116>If someone approaches, don't speak.</t4116>
<t4117>We walk with our heads down, as usual.</t4117> <t4118>I am so excited that it is difficult for me to breathe, but I move forward with a steady pace.</t4118> <t4119>Now more than ever, I must avoid drawing attention.</t4119>
<t4120>—I thought you were a true believer —says Deglen.</t4120>
<t4121>—I thought the same about you —I reply.</t4121>
<t4122>—You always showed yourself disgustingly pious.</t4122>
<t4123>—You too —I reply.</t4123> <t4124>I feel like laughing, shouting, hugging her.</t4124>
<t4125>—We can join —he proposes.</t4125>
<t4126>—Join together? —I ask.</t4126> <t4127>So there is an us, a we exists.</t4127> <t4128>I knew it.</t4128>
<t4129>—You don't think I'm the only one.</t4129>
<t4130>I didn't believe it.</t4130> <t4131>It occurs to me that she could be a spy, a ploy to trap me; this is the terrain we are moving in.</t4131> <t4132>But I can't believe it.</t4132> <t4133>Hope springs within me, like the sap of a tree.</t4133> <t4134>Or the blood in a wound.</t4134>
<t4135>We have opened a breach.</t4135>
<t4136>I want to ask if he has seen Moira, if someone can find out what happened to Luke, to my daughter, even to my mother, but there is no time anymore.</t4136> <t4137>We approach the corner of the main street, where the first barrier is located.</t4137>
<t4138>There will be too many people.</t4138>
<t4139>—Don't say a single word —Deglen warns me, although it isn't necessary—.</t4139>
<t4140>Under no circumstances.</t4140>
<t4141>—Of course not —I reassure her—.</t4141> <t4142>Who would I tell?</t4142>
<t4143>We walked in silence down the main street, passing by Azucenas and Todo Carne.</t4143> <t4144>This afternoon, there are more people than usual on the sidewalks: it must be the heat.</t4144> <t4145>Women dressed in green, blue, red, stripes; there are also men, some in uniform and others in civilian clothes.</t4145> <t4146>The sun is for everyone, it is still there to be enjoyed.</t4146> <t4147>Although now no one sunbathes, at least not in public.</t4147>
<t4148>There are also more cars, Whirlwinds with their chauffeurs and their lounging occupants, lower-class cars driven by lower-class men.</t4148>
<t4149>Something is happening: there is an uproar, an agitation among the cars.</t4149> <t4150>Some are pulling over to the side, as if getting out of the way.</t4150> <t4151>I take a quick look: it's a black van with a white eye on the side.</t4151> <t4152>The siren is not on, but even so, the other cars are avoiding it.</t4152> <t4153>It crosses the street slowly, as if looking for something: a shark on the prowl.</t4153>
<t4154>I remain motionless, and a shiver runs through my body from head to toe.</t4154> <t4155>There must have been microphones, so they heard us.</t4155>
<t4156>Covering her hand with her sleeve, Deglen grabs my arm.</t4156>
<t4157>—Don't stop —he murmurs—.</t4157> <t4158>Act as if you haven't seen anything.</t4158>
<t4159>But I can't stop looking.</t4159> <t4160>The van stops exactly in front of us.</t4160> <t4161>Two Eyes dressed in gray suits jump out from the now open rear doors.</t4161> <t4162>They grab a man who is walking, a man with a briefcase, an ordinary-looking man, and push him against the side of the van.</t4162> <t4163>He stays there for a moment, crushed against the metal, as if he were glued.</t4163>
<t4164>Then one of the Eyes approaches him and makes a sudden and brutal movement that causes the man to double over and fall, turning into a rag.</t4164> <t4165>They lift him and throw him into the back of the van, as if he were a mail sack.</t4165> <t4166>Then they get in, the doors close, and the van starts.</t4166>
<t4167>Everything happens in a matter of seconds and the traffic resumes as if nothing had happened.</t4167>
<t4168>I feel relief.</t4168> <t4169>It wasn't about me.</t4169>
<t4170>CHAPTER 28</t4170>
<t4171>This afternoon I don't feel like taking a nap, my adrenaline level is still very high.</t4171> <t4172>I settle into the window seat and look through the semi-transparent curtains.</t4172> <t4173>White nightgown.</t4173> <t4174>The window is open all the way, a slight breeze comes through it, warm because of the sun, and the white fabric hits my face.</t4174>
<t4175>From the outside —with my face covered by the curtain and only my profile in view, the nose, the bandaged mouth, the blind eyes— I surely look like a cocoon, a specter.</t4175> <t4176>I like the sensation the soft fabric produces when it brushes against my skin.</t4176> <t4177>It's like being on a cloud.</t4177>
<t4178>They have provided me with a small electric fan, which dissipates the moisture from the air.</t4178> <t4179>It is in a corner, on the floor, and its blades —framed by a grille—</t4179>
<t4180>they emit a buzz.</t4180> <t4181>If I were Moira, I would know how to disassemble it to use its sharp edges.</t4181> <t4182>I don't have a screwdriver, although if I were Moira, I wouldn't need one.</t4182>
<t4183>But I am not Moira.</t4183>
<t4184>What would you think of the Commander, if he were here?</t4184> <t4185>Surely he wouldn't like it.</t4185>
<t4186>She didn't like Luke back then either.</t4186> <t4187>It wasn't that she didn't like Luke, but rather the fact that he was married.</t4187> <t4188>She said that I was like a poacher, intruding on another woman's territory.</t4188> <t4189>I replied that Luke was neither a fish nor a piece of land, that he was a human being and could make his own decisions.</t4189>
<t4190>He argued that I was rationalizing the problem, and I explained to him that I was in love.</t4190> <t4191>He told me that was not a justification.</t4191> <t4192>Moira was always more logical than me.</t4192>
<t4193>I told him that since he now preferred women, he no longer had that problem and that, from what I could see, he had no qualms about stealing them or borrowing them whenever he felt like it.</t4193> <t4194>He replied that it was different because, among women, the power was balanced in such a way that sex became an awesome transaction.</t4194>
<t4195>I asserted that, if it was because of that, she was using a sexist expression, and that anyway that argument was outdated.</t4195> <t4196>She reproached me for trivializing the issue and said that if I thought the argument was outdated, I was living in another world.</t4196>
<t4197>We said all this in the kitchen of my house, drinking coffee, sitting at the table, in that low and deep tone of voice that we used for this type of discussions when we were barely twenty years old; a habit from our schoolgirl days.</t4197>
<t4198>The kitchen was in a dilapidated apartment of a wooden house, near the river, the kind of three-story house with a rickety exterior staircase at the back.</t4198>
<t4199>I lived on the second floor, which meant I had to endure the noises from the floor above and the floor below, like two stereophonic turntables that I hadn't asked for and that rumbled late into the night.</t4199> <t4200>Students, I knew.</t4200> <t4201>I had my first job, where I wasn't paid much: I managed the computer for an insurance company.</t4201> <t4202>Therefore, when I went to hotels with Luke, they didn't just mean love and not even just sex for me.</t4202> <t4203>They also meant that I got rid for a while of the cockroaches, the dripping faucet, the linoleum peeling off the floor in pieces, even my own attempts to brighten up the house by sticking posters on the wall and hanging prisms in the windows.</t4203> <t4204>I also had plants, although they always ended up infested with insects, or they died from lack of water.</t4204> <t4205>I went out with Luke and forgot about them.</t4205>
<t4206>I said that there was more than one way to live in another world, and that if Moira thought she could create Utopia by enclosing herself in a circle formed exclusively by women, she was sadly mistaken.</t4206> <t4207>Men are not going to disappear just like that, I warned her.</t4207> <t4208>You cannot ignore them.</t4208>
<t4209>That's the same as saying you're going to catch syphilis just because it exists, argued Moira.</t4209>
<t4210>Are you saying that Luke is a social ill?, I asked him.</t4210>
<t4211>Moira burst out laughing.</t4211> <t4212>Do you hear what we are saying?, she reflected.</t4212> <t4213>Shit.</t4213>
<t4214>We speak like your mother.</t4214>
<t4215>Then we both laughed, and when she left, we hugged as usual.</t4215>
<t4216>There was a time when we didn't hug, when she told me she was gay; but later she told me that I didn't excite her, it reassured me, and we resumed the habit.</t4216>
<t4217>We could fight, argue, and insult each other, but deep down, nothing changed.</t4217> <t4218>She was still my best friend.</t4218>
<t4219>It is.</t4219>
<t4220>Later, I got a better apartment, where I lived for the two years it took Luke to become independent.</t4220> <t4221>I paid for it myself with what I earned at my new job.</t4221>
<t4222>He worked in a library, not as large as that of Death and Victory, but smaller.</t4222>
<t4223>My job consisted of transferring the books to computer disks in order to reduce storage space and replacement costs, according to what they said.</t4223> <t4224>We called ourselves "diskers," and we jokingly called the library "the discotheque."</t4224> <t4225>Once the books were recorded, they ended up in a shredder, but sometimes I took them home.</t4225> <t4226>I liked their texture and appearance.</t4226> <t4227>Luke said I had the mentality of an antiquarian.</t4227> <t4228>He liked it; he loved old things.</t4228>
<t4229>Now it seems strange to think about having a job.</t4229> <t4230>Job: it's a strange word.</t4230>
<t4231>Chores are the housework.</t4231> <t4232>Do your little chores, they would say to the children when teaching them to use the toilet.</t4232> <t4233>Or about dogs: it has done its business on the carpet.</t4233> <t4234>My mother used to say that you should hit them with a rolled-up newspaper.</t4234>
<t4235>I remember the time when there were newspapers, but I never had dogs, only cats.</t4235>
<t4236>What a mess they made for us.</t4236>
<t4237>There were so many women who worked... now it seems hard to imagine, but there were thousands, millions of women who worked.</t4237> <t4238>It was considered a normal thing.</t4238> <t4239>Now it's the same as thinking about the time when they still had paper money.</t4239> <t4240>My mother pasted some bills in her scrapbook, along with the first photos.</t4240> <t4241>Back then they were already obsolete, you couldn't use them to buy anything.</t4241> <t4242>Pieces of coarse paper, greasy to the touch, green in color, with photos on both sides, an old man with a wig on one side, and on the other a pyramid with an eye on top.</t4242> <t4243>It had the phrase In God We Trust printed on it.</t4243> <t4244>My mother said that, as a joke, merchants would put up signs next to the cash registers that read: In God We Trust, all others pay cash.</t4244> <t4245>Now, that would be blasphemy.</t4245>
<t4246>When you went to buy, you had to carry those paper bills, although when I was nine or ten years old, most people used plastic cards.</t4246> <t4247>But not for shopping at grocery stores, that came later.</t4247> <t4248>It seems so primitive, even totemic, like cowrie shells.</t4248> <t4249>I myself must have used that type of money for some time, before everything went through the Compubank.</t4249>
<t4250>I imagine that is what made things possible, the fact that they did it suddenly, without anyone knowing in advance.</t4250> <t4251>If cash had still existed, it would have been more difficult.</t4251>
<t4252>It was after the catastrophe, when they shot the president and machine-gunned the Congress, and the army declared a state of emergency.</t4252> <t4253>At that time, they blamed the Islamic fanatics.</t4253>
<t4254>We must stay calm, they advised on television.</t4254> <t4255>Everything is under control.</t4255>
<t4256>I was stunned.</t4256> <t4257>Like everyone else, I know.</t4257> <t4258>It was hard to believe.</t4258> <t4259>The entire government disappeared in that way.</t4259> <t4260>How did they manage it, how did it happen?</t4260>
<t4261>It was then that they suspended the Constitution.</t4261> <t4262>They said it would be something temporary.</t4262> <t4263>There weren't even any street disturbances.</t4263> <t4264>At night, people stayed at home watching television and waiting for instructions.</t4264> <t4265>There wasn't even an enemy to denounce.</t4265>
<t4266>Be careful, Moira warned me over the phone.</t4266> <t4267>It's coming closer.</t4267>
<t4268>What is approaching?, I asked him.</t4268>
<t4269>Wait and see, he replied.</t4269> <t4270>They have everything set up.</t4270> <t4271>You and I will end up against the wall, dear.</t4271> <t4272>She was quoting a typical phrase of my mother, but she did not intend to be funny.</t4272>
<t4273>Things continued for weeks in that state of momentary suspension, although in reality something did happen.</t4273> <t4274>The newspapers were subjected to censorship and some were shut down, reportedly for security reasons.</t4274> <t4275>Barricades began to be erected and identification passes started to appear.</t4275> <t4276>Everyone approved of it, as it was obvious that no precaution was excessive.</t4276> <t4277>They said that new elections would be held, but that it would take some time to prepare them.</t4277> <t4278>What needs to be done, they declared, is to continue as usual.</t4278>
<t4279>However, the porn shops were closed, and the Sensations on Wheels vans and the Buggies of the Buns stopped circulating.</t4279> <t4280>I didn't feel sorry that they disappeared.</t4280> <t4281>We already knew they were nonsense.</t4281>
<t4282>It was about time someone did something, said the woman behind the counter of the store where I used to buy cigarettes.</t4282> <t4283>It was on a corner and belonged to a chain of kiosks that sold newspapers, sweets, and cigarettes.</t4283> <t4284>The saleswoman was an older woman, with gray hair, from my mother's generation.</t4284>
<t4285>Have they been banned, or what happened?, I asked.</t4285>
<t4286>The woman shrugged her shoulders.</t4286> <t4287>Nobody knows and nobody cares, she commented.</t4287>
<t4288>Maybe they took them somewhere else.</t4288> <t4289>Trying to get rid of that completely is like trying to eliminate mice, you know.</t4289> <t4290>She pressed my Compunumber on the cash register, barely looking at it.</t4290> <t4291>Back then, I was a regular customer.</t4291> <t4292>People were starting to complain, she stated.</t4292>
<t4293>The next morning, on my way to the library, I stopped at the same store to buy another pack of cigarettes, because I had run out.</t4293> <t4294>Those days I was smoking more than usual, due to the tension that was perceived as an underground murmur, although calm apparently prevailed.</t4294> <t4295>I was also drinking more coffee, and having trouble sleeping.</t4295> <t4296>Everyone was a bit on edge.</t4296> <t4297>There was more music than ever on the radio, and fewer words.</t4297>
<t4298>We had already gotten married, it seemed like years ago; she was three or four, and she was going to daycare.</t4298>
<t4299>I remember that we had gotten up and had breakfast as usual, with cookies, and Luke had driven her to school.</t4299> <t4300>She was dressed in the outfit I had bought her two weeks ago, the striped smock and a blue t-shirt.</t4300> <t4301>What month was it?</t4301> <t4302>It must have been September.</t4302> <t4303>The school had a child pickup service, but for some reason, I preferred that Luke take her; even the school's service worried me.</t4303> <t4304>Children no longer walked to school, there had been many cases of missing children.</t4304>
<t4305>When I arrived at the corner store, I saw that the usual saleswoman was not there.</t4305>
<t4306>In his place, there was a man, a young man who could not have been more than twenty years old.</t4306>
<t4307>"Is she sick?" I asked her as I handed her the card.</t4307>
<t4308>"Who?" he asked me in a tone that seemed aggressive to me.</t4308>
<t4309>The saleswoman who is always here, I clarified.</t4309>
<t4310>"How do you expect me to know?" he replied.</t4310> <t4311>He was entering my code using only one finger, and he studied each number carefully.</t4311> <t4312>Evidently, it was the first time he was doing it.</t4312> <t4313>I drummed my fingers on the counter, impatient to smoke, and wondered if anyone had ever told him how to get rid of the pimples on his neck.</t4313> <t4314>I clearly remember his appearance: tall, slightly hunched, dark short hair, brown eyes —which seemed fixed on some point behind my nasal bridge—, and pimples.</t4314> <t4315>I suppose I remember it so clearly because of what he said next.</t4315>
<t4316>I'm sorry.</t4316> <t4317>This number is not valid.</t4317>
<t4318>What a ridiculous thing, I protested.</t4318> <t4319>It has to be, I have several thousand in the account.</t4319> <t4320>I requested a statement two days ago.</t4320> <t4321>Try again.</t4321>
<t4322>It's not valid, he repeated stubbornly.</t4322> <t4323>Do you see the red light?</t4323> <t4324>It means it's not valid.</t4324>
<t4325>He must have made a mistake, I insisted.</t4325> <t4326>Try again.</t4326>
<t4327>He shrugged and gave me a self-satisfied smile, but he dialed the number again.</t4327> <t4328>This time I watched his fingers and checked the numbers that appeared on the screen.</t4328> <t4329>It was my number, but the red light came on again.</t4329>
<t4330>Do you see it? he said to me, showing the same smile, as if he knew a joke he wasn't planning to tell me.</t4330>
<t4331>I will call you from the office, I affirmed.</t4331> <t4332>The system had failed on other occasions, but usually after a phone call, it would be fixed.</t4332> <t4333>Anyway, I was furious, as if I had been unjustly accused of something that I didn't even know what it was.</t4333> <t4334>As if I had made the mistake.</t4334>
<t4335>Do it, he replied indifferently.</t4335> <t4336>I left the cigarettes on the counter because I hadn't paid for them.</t4336> <t4337>I thought I could borrow one at work.</t4337>
<t4338>Upon arriving at the office, I telephoned, but an answering machine responded.</t4338> <t4339>The lines are overloaded, said the recording.</t4339> <t4340>Could you call back later?</t4340>
<t4341>As far as I know, the lines were overloaded all morning.</t4341> <t4342>I called back several times, but without success.</t4342> <t4343>That wasn't too unusual either.</t4343>
<t4344>Around two o'clock, after lunch, the director entered the record room.</t4344>
<t4345>I have something to tell you, he said.</t4345> <t4346>He looked terrible: his hair was disheveled and his eyes were red and blurry, as if he had been drinking.</t4346>
<t4347>We all looked up from our machines.</t4347> <t4348>There must have been eight or ten of us in the room.</t4348>
<t4349>I'm sorry, he announced, but it's the law.</t4349> <t4350>I'm truly sorry.</t4350>
<t4351>What is it that he regrets? someone asked.</t4351>
<t4352>I have to let you go, he explained.</t4352> <t4353>It's the law, I have to do it.</t4353> <t4354>I have to let all of you go.</t4354> <t4355>He said it almost kindly, as if we were wild animals or frogs that he had locked in a container, as if he wanted to be humane.</t4355>
<t4356>Is he kicking us out? I asked, and stood up.</t4356> <t4357>But why?</t4357>
<t4358>I'm not throwing you out, he pointed out.</t4358> <t4359>I'm letting you go.</t4359> <t4360>You can't work here anymore, it's the law.</t4360> <t4361>He ran his hands through his hair, and I thought he had gone mad.</t4361> <t4362>He has endured too much stress and has ended up losing his temper.</t4362>
<t4363>You can't just do it like that, the woman sitting next to me said.</t4363> <t4364>The phrase sounded false, improbable, like something someone would say on television.</t4364>
<t4365>It's not me, he argued.</t4365> <t4366>You don't understand.</t4366> <t4367>Please, leave now.</t4367> <t4368>He was raising his voice.</t4368> <t4369>I don't want any trouble.</t4369> <t4370>If trouble arises, the books could be lost, everything would be destroyed...</t4370> <t4371>He looked over his shoulder.</t4371> <t4372>They are outside, he explained, in my office.</t4372> <t4373>If you don't leave now, they will come themselves.</t4373> <t4374>They gave me ten minutes.</t4374> <t4375>At that moment, he seemed crazier than ever.</t4375>
<t4376>He's gone mad, someone said out loud; we all must have been thinking the same thing.</t4376>
<t4377>But I could see that in the hallway there were two men standing, in uniform and with machine guns.</t4377> <t4378>It was too theatrical to be true, and yet there they were, like sudden apparitions, like Martians.</t4378> <t4379>They were surrounded by an aura of dreaminess; they were too vivid, too incongruous with the surroundings.</t4379>
<t4380>Leave the machines, he added as we gathered our things and filed out.</t4380> <t4381>As if we could have taken them with us.</t4381>
<t4382>We gathered on the steps at the entrance to the library.</t4382> <t4383>We didn't know what to say to each other.</t4383> <t4384>Since no one understood what had happened, there wasn't much we could say.</t4384> <t4385>We looked at each other and only saw consternation on our faces, and some embarrassment, as if we had been caught doing something we shouldn't have been doing.</t4385>
<t4386>It's not fair, said a woman, but without conviction.</t4386> <t4387>What was it that made us feel as if we deserved it?</t4387>
<t4388>When I got home, there was no one there.</t4388> <t4389>Luke was still at work, and my daughter was at school.</t4389> <t4390>I felt tired, absolutely exhausted, but when I sat down, I got back up again; I couldn't stay still.</t4390> <t4391>I wandered around the house, from one room to another.</t4391> <t4392>I remember touching things, not in a conscious way but simply placing my fingers on them; things like the toaster, the sugar bowl, the ashtray in the living room.</t4392> <t4393>A little while later, I picked up the cat and continued wandering around with her in my arms.</t4393>
<t4394>I wanted Luke to come back home.</t4394> <t4395>I thought I had to do something, make some decision; but I didn't know what decision I could make.</t4395>
<t4396>I tried calling the bank again, but I heard the same recording.</t4396> <t4397>I poured myself a glass of milk —I told myself I was too terrified to have another coffee— and went to the living room; I sat on the sofa and carefully placed the glass on the table, without taking a sip.</t4397> <t4398>I had the cat against my chest and could hear her purring.</t4398>
<t4399>A little while later, I called my mother at her apartment, but there was no answer.</t4399>
<t4400>At that time, he had settled down and no longer moved very often; he lived on the other side of the river, in Boston.</t4400> <t4401>I waited a bit and called Moira.</t4401> <t4402>She wasn't there either, but I tried again half an hour later and found her.</t4402> <t4403>During the time between one call and the other, I stayed sitting on the sofa.</t4403> <t4404>I thought about my daughter's school lunches.</t4404> <t4405>It occurred to me that maybe I had been giving her too many peanut butter sandwiches.</t4405>
<t4406>They had fired me, I told Moira when I spoke with her on the phone.</t4406> <t4407>She said she would come.</t4407> <t4408>At that time, she was working with a women's collective, in the editorial department.</t4408> <t4409>They published books on birth control, rape, and topics of that kind, although there wasn't as much demand as before.</t4409>
<t4410>I'll be right back, he reassured me.</t4410> <t4411>From the tone of my voice, he must have realized that this was what I wanted.</t4411>
<t4412>He arrived home shortly after.</t4412> <t4413>Let's see, he said.</t4413> <t4414>He took off his jacket and dropped into the enormous armchair.</t4414> <t4415>Tell me.</t4415> <t4416>But first, we'll have a drink.</t4416>
<t4417>He got up, went to the kitchen, and poured a couple of whiskeys; he came back, sat down, and I tried to tell him what had happened to me.</t4417> <t4418>When I finished, he asked me: Have you tried to buy something with your Computarjeta today?</t4418>
<t4419>Yes, I replied, and I also told him what happened.</t4419>
<t4420>They have frozen them, she explained to me.</t4420> <t4421>Mine too.</t4421> <t4422>The one for the collective too.</t4422> <t4423>All the accounts that have an H instead of a V.</t4423> <t4424>All they had to do was press a few buttons.</t4424> <t4425>We are isolated.</t4425>
<t4426>But I had more than two thousand dollars in the bank, I lamented, as if my account was the only one that mattered.</t4426>
<t4427>The women can no longer have anything of our own, she informed me.</t4427> <t4428>It's a new law.</t4428> <t4429>Did you turn on the television today?</t4429>
<t4430>No, I replied.</t4430>
<t4431>They announced it.</t4431> <t4432>Throughout the entire country.</t4432> <t4433>She wasn't as astonished as I was.</t4433> <t4434>Somehow, strangely, she was happy, as if this was what she had been waiting for a long time and now it proved she was right.</t4434> <t4435>She even looked more energetic, more determined.</t4435> <t4436>Luke can use your Compucount for you, she pointed out.</t4436> <t4437>They will transfer your number to him, at least that's what they said.</t4437> <t4438>To the husband or the closest male relative.</t4438>
<t4439>And what will they do in your case? I asked.</t4439> <t4440>She had no one.</t4440>
<t4441>I will go underground, he noted.</t4441> <t4442>Some gays can take care of our numbers and buy us what we need.</t4442>
<t4443>But why?, I protested.</t4443> <t4444>Why did they do it?</t4444>
<t4445>There's no need to find out why anymore, Moira concluded.</t4445> <t4446>They had to do it that way, the Compucuentas and the jobs at the same time.</t4446> <t4447>Otherwise, can you imagine what would have happened at the airports?</t4447> <t4448>They don't want us to go anywhere, I'll bet you anything.</t4448>
<t4449>I went to pick up my daughter from school.</t4449> <t4450>I drove with exaggerated caution.</t4450> <t4451>When Luke got home, I was by the kitchen table.</t4451> <t4452>She was drawing with markers at her little table in the corner where we had stuck her paintings, next to the fridge.</t4452>
<t4453>Luke knelt beside me and wrapped his arms around me.</t4453> <t4454>I heard it on the car radio, he said, while coming.</t4454> <t4455>Don't worry, I'm sure it's something temporary.</t4455>
<t4456>Did they say why?, I asked him.</t4456>
<t4457>He didn't answer me.</t4457> <t4458>We will get through this, he assured me while hugging me.</t4458>
<t4459>You have no idea what it represents, I told him.</t4459> <t4460>I feel as if my feet have been amputated.</t4460> <t4461>I wasn't crying.</t4461> <t4462>And I couldn't hug him either.</t4462>
<t4463>It's just a setback, he said trying to calm me down.</t4463>
<t4464>I suppose you'll keep all my money, I commented.</t4464>
<t4465>And that's even though I'm not dead yet.</t4465> <t4466>I wanted to make a joke, but a macabre phrase came out instead.</t4466>
<t4467>Be quiet, he asked me.</t4467> <t4468>He was still kneeling on the ground.</t4468> <t4469>You know I will always take care of you.</t4469>
<t4470>He's starting to treat me with a protective air, I thought.</t4470> <t4471>And you're starting to get paranoid, I told myself.</t4471>
<t4472>I know, I replied.</t4472> <t4473>I love you.</t4473>
<t4474>Later, when she was lying down and we were having dinner, and I stopped trembling, I told her what had happened to me that afternoon.</t4474> <t4475>I told her about the appearance of the director and his unexpected announcement.</t4475> <t4476>If it weren't so frightening, it would have been funny, I commented.</t4476> <t4477>I thought he was drunk.</t4477> <t4478>Maybe he was.</t4478> <t4479>But the army was there.</t4479>
<t4480>Then I remembered something I had seen but, nevertheless, had not noticed.</t4480> <t4481>It wasn't the army.</t4481> <t4482>It was another army.</t4482>
<t4483>Of course, marches were organized by lots of women and some men.</t4483>
<t4484>But they were less important than anyone might think.</t4484> <t4485>I think people were panicking.</t4485> <t4486>And when it became known that the police, or the army, or whoever, would open fire as soon as a single one of those marches started, they were disrupted.</t4486>
<t4487>Two or three buildings, post offices, and metro stations were blown up.</t4487> <t4488>But one couldn't even be sure who was doing all that.</t4488> <t4489>It could have been the army, to justify the computer records and the other door-to-door searches.</t4489>
<t4490>I was not part of any of those marches.</t4490> <t4491>Luke thought it was useless, and that I had to think about them, about my family, about him and her.</t4491> <t4492>And I thought about my family.</t4492>
<t4493>I started dedicating myself more to household chores, to cooking.</t4493> <t4494>I tried not to cry at mealtime.</t4494> <t4495>But that time I unexpectedly burst into tears and sat by the window of the room, looking outside.</t4495> <t4496>I practically didn't know the neighbors, and when we met on the street, we were very careful not to exchange more than the customary greeting.</t4496> <t4497>Nobody wanted to be reported for disloyalty.</t4497>
<t4498>When I recall this time, I also remember my mother, years ago.</t4498> <t4499>I must have been fourteen or fifteen years old, the age when daughters have the most conflicts with their mothers.</t4499> <t4500>I remember she returned to one of her many apartments with a group of women who were part of her ever-renewing circle of friends.</t4500> <t4501>That day they had attended a march; it was the time of the disturbances due to pornography, or due to abortions, they were closely linked.</t4501> <t4502>There were a few bombings: clinics, video stores; it was difficult to closely follow the events.</t4502>
<t4503>My mother had a bruise on her face and a bit of blood.</t4503> <t4504>You can't go through glass with your hand and not cut yourself, she remarked.</t4504> <t4505>Fucking pigs.</t4505>
<t4506>Damn pro-birthers, one of her friends corrected.</t4506> <t4507>They called their opponents pro-birthers because of the signs they carried: Let them be born.</t4507> <t4508>So it must have been a disturbance over the abortion issue.</t4508>
<t4509>I went to my bedroom to get away from them.</t4509> <t4510>They talked too much, and very loudly.</t4510> <t4511>They ignored me and I got offended.</t4511> <t4512>My mother and her rowdy friends.</t4512> <t4513>I didn't understand why she had to dress that way, in overalls, as if she were young; and use those swear words.</t4513>
<t4514>You are a prude, he would say to me, generally in a tone of satisfaction.</t4514> <t4515>He liked being more scandalous than me, more rebellious.</t4515> <t4516>Teenagers are always prudes.</t4516>
<t4517>I am sure that part of my disapproval was due to that: the negligence, the routine.</t4517> <t4518>But I also expected from her a more ceremonious life, less subject to improvisation and constant fleeing.</t4518>
<t4519>God knows you were a wanted child, she assured me at other times, while she amused herself with the photo albums where she kept me stored.</t4519> <t4520>Those albums were full of chubby babies, but my replicas became more slender as I grew, as if the population of my doubles had been ravaged by some plague.</t4520>
<t4521>She said it with a certain regret, as if I had not turned out exactly as she expected.</t4521> <t4522>Mothers never completely align with the idea a child has of what a mother should be, and I suppose the same happens in the reverse case.</t4522> <t4523>But despite everything, we didn't get along badly, most of the time we had a good time.</t4523>
<t4524>I would like you to be here, to tell you that I have finally discovered it.</t4524>
<t4525>Someone has gone out.</t4525> <t4526>I hear a door closing in the distance, somewhere on the side of the house, and some footsteps on the path.</t4526> <t4527>It's Nick, now I see him; he walks down the path to the lawn to breathe the humid air filled with the scent of flowers, lush vegetation, and pollen thrown into the wind in bunches, like oyster eggs in the sea.</t4527> <t4528>What a waste of life.</t4528> <t4529>He stretches out under the sun, I notice the ripple of his muscles, like a cat arching its back.</t4529> <t4530>He's in his shirtsleeves, and his bare arms boldly stick out from under the rolled-up fabric.</t4530> <t4531>Where will his tan end?</t4531> <t4532>Since that dreamy night in the moonlit room, I haven't spoken to him again.</t4532> <t4533>He is only my flag, my traffic light.</t4533> <t4534>Ours is a body language.</t4534>
<t4535>At this moment, he has his cap tilted, which means they are calling for me.</t4535>
<t4536>What does he get out of all this, playing the role of a page?</t4536> <t4537>What does he feel playing this ambiguous role of the Commander's pimp?</t4537> <t4538>Does it disgust him, or does it make him desire something more from me, desire me more?</t4538> <t4539>Because he has no idea what really happens in there, among the books.</t4539> <t4540>Acts of perversion, for all he knows.</t4540> <t4541>The Commander and I covering each other with ink and licking it off with our tongues, or making love on piles of forbidden newspaper pages.</t4541> <t4542>Well, he must not be very far off.</t4542>
<t4543>But surely he gets some benefit from it.</t4543> <t4544>In some way, everyone looks out for themselves.</t4544> <t4545>Any extra packs of cigarettes?</t4545> <t4546>Any freedom that is not normally granted?</t4546> <t4547>Anyway, what can he prove?</t4547> <t4548>It's his word against the Commander's, unless he intends to show up with a group of people.</t4548> <t4549>A kick to the door, and what did I tell you?</t4549> <t4550>Caught in the middle of a sinful game of Intelect.</t4550>
<t4551>Come on, swallow those words.</t4551>
<t4552>Maybe it gives him satisfaction just to know something secret.</t4552> <t4553>Or to have some information about me, as they used to say.</t4553> <t4554>It's the kind of power that can only be used once.</t4554>
<t4555>I would like to have a better opinion of him.</t4555>
<t4556>That night, after losing my job, Luke wanted us to make love.</t4556>
<t4557>Why didn't I want to do it?</t4557> <t4558>It must have been desperation.</t4558> <t4559>But I still felt paralyzed.</t4559> <t4560>I could barely feel his hands on my body.</t4560>
<t4561>What's happening? he asked me.</t4561>
<t4562>I don't know, I said.</t4562>
<t4563>We still have...</t4563> <t4564>But he didn't say what it was that we still had.</t4564> <t4565>It occurred to me that maybe he didn't mean we still have, since, as far as I knew, nothing had been taken from him.</t4565>
<t4566>We still have each other, I concluded.</t4566> <t4567>And it was true.</t4567> <t4568>So why did he seem, even to my eyes, so indifferent?</t4568>
<t4569>He kissed me, as if after I uttered that phrase, things could return to normal.</t4569> <t4570>But something had changed, the same balance no longer existed.</t4570>
<t4571>I felt myself shrinking, so much so that when he wrapped his arms around me, I was as small as a doll.</t4571> <t4572>I felt that love was leaving without me.</t4572>
<t4573>He doesn't care, I thought.</t4573> <t4574>He doesn't care in the slightest.</t4574> <t4575>Maybe he even likes it.</t4575> <t4576>We no longer belong to each other.</t4576> <t4577>On the contrary, I am his.</t4577>
<t4578>Outrageous, unjust, false.</t4578> <t4579>But that is what happened.</t4579>
<t4580>That's why, Luke, what I want to ask you, what I need to know is if I was right.</t4580> <t4581>Because we never talked about it.</t4581> <t4582>When I could have done it, I was afraid.</t4582>
<t4583>I couldn't afford the luxury of losing you.</t4583>
<t4584>CHAPTER 29</t4584>
<t4585>I am sitting in the Commander's office, on the other side of his desk, as if I were a bank client requesting a large loan.</t4585> <t4586>But aside from my situation in the office, there is none of that formality between us.</t4586> <t4587>I no longer feel rigid with my back straight, nor my feet together and my gaze alert.</t4587> <t4588>On the contrary, my body is relaxed and I am even comfortable.</t4588> <t4589>I have taken off my red shoes and have my legs tucked under my body, covered by the red skirt, it's true, but crossed, as if I were sitting in front of a campfire, like we used to do in the times when we went on picnics.</t4589> <t4590>If the fireplace were lit, its light would flicker over the shiny surfaces, and it would softly shine on our flesh.</t4590> <t4591>I add the light of the hearth myself.</t4591>
<t4592>As for the Commander, tonight he appears excessively carefree.</t4592> <t4593>He has taken off his jacket and has his elbows resting on the table.</t4593> <t4594>All he needs is a toothpick on the side of his mouth to look just like an advertisement for rural democracy, as if he stepped out of an etching.</t4594> <t4595>A tiny fly speck, an old burnt book.</t4595>
<t4596>The squares on the board in front of me are starting to fill up: I'm playing the second-to-last game of the night.</t4596> <t4597>I form the word "asaz," the best way I have to use the valuable "z."</t4597>
<t4598>—Is that a word? —asks the Commander.</t4598>
<t4599>—We could consult the dictionary —I suggest—.</t4599> <t4600>It's an archaism.</t4600>
<t4601>—Agreed —he responds and smiles.</t4601> <t4602>The Commander likes that I stand out, that I show precocity like a little domestic animal always attentive, with ears perked up and eager to act.</t4602> <t4603>His approval envelops me warmly.</t4603> <t4604>I don't perceive in him any of the animosity I used to notice in men, even in Luke, sometimes.</t4604> <t4605>He's not mentally calling me a whore.</t4605> <t4606>In fact, he is truly paternal.</t4606> <t4607>He likes to think that I'm having a good time; and so I am, so I am.</t4607>
<t4608>Skillfully add up our final score on your pocket computer.</t4608>
<t4609>—You win by several points —he points out.</t4609> <t4610>I suspect he is deceiving me to flatter me, to put me in a good mood.</t4610> <t4611>But why?</t4611> <t4612>There is still one question left.</t4612> <t4613>What does he intend to gain by pampering me in this way?</t4613> <t4614>There must be something.</t4614>
<t4615>He leans back in his chair and brings the tips of his fingers together, a gesture that now seems familiar to me.</t4615> <t4616>A whole repertoire of gestures and familiarities has developed between us.</t4616> <t4617>Now he is looking at me, not in an unkind way but with curiosity, as if I were a puzzle he has to solve.</t4617>
<t4618>—What would you like to read tonight? —he asks me.</t4618> <t4619>This has also become a habit.</t4619> <t4620>Up until that moment, I had read an entire issue of Mademoiselle magazine, an old Esquire from the eighties, and a Ms.</t4620> <t4621>—a magazine I vaguely remember seeing around in one of my mother's many apartments when I was a child—, and an issue of Reader’s Digest.</t4621> <t4622>He even has novels.</t4622> <t4623>I have read one by Raymond Chandler, and now I am halfway through Hard Times by Charles Dickens.</t4623> <t4624>On these occasions, I read quickly, voraciously, almost skimming and trying to fill my head as much as possible before the prolonged fast that awaits me.</t4624> <t4625>If it were food, it would be the gluttony of the famished; if it were sex, it would be quick, furtive, and done standing in some alley.</t4625>
<t4626>While I read, the Commander sits and watches me, without saying anything, but also without taking his eyes off me.</t4626> <t4627>The act of watching me is a curiously sexual act, and while he does it, I feel naked.</t4627> <t4628>I wish he would turn his back, walk around the room, that he would also read something.</t4628> <t4629>Then maybe I could relax more, take my time.</t4629> <t4630>Instead, this illicit act of reading feels like a kind of performance.</t4630>
<t4631>—I think I prefer to talk —I comment.</t4631> <t4632>I myself am surprised to hear what I say.</t4632>
<t4633>He smiles again.</t4633> <t4634>He doesn't seem surprised.</t4634> <t4635>He was probably expecting this, or something like it.</t4635>
<t4636>—Oh —he says—.</t4636> <t4637>What would you like to talk about?</t4637>
<t4638>Hesitation.</t4638>
<t4639>—Of anything, I suppose.</t4639> <t4640>Well, of you, for example.</t4640>
<t4641>—About me? —he smiles again—.</t4641> <t4642>Oh, there isn't much to say about me.</t4642> <t4643>I'm just an ordinary guy.</t4643>
<t4644>The falseness of the phrase, and even the way of saying "dude," are shocking to me.</t4644>
<t4645>Normally, ordinary guys don't become Commanders.</t4645>
<t4646>—It must have some special characteristic —I point out.</t4646> <t4647>I know that I am provoking him, flattering him, loosening his tongue, and I disgust myself; in fact, this is nauseating.</t4647> <t4648>But we keep passing the ball to each other.</t4648> <t4649>If he doesn't speak, I will.</t4649> <t4650>I know it, I can feel the words retreating inside me, it's been a long time since I've really talked to someone.</t4650> <t4651>The brief whisper exchanged today with Deglen during our walk barely counts; but it was an incitement, a prelude.</t4651> <t4652>After the relief I felt, even with such a brief conversation, I want more.</t4652>
<t4653>But if I speak, I will say something I shouldn't, I will reveal something.</t4653> <t4654>I even feel it, like a betrayal to myself.</t4654> <t4655>I don't want him to know too much.</t4655>
<t4656>—Oh, to start with, I was dedicated to market research —he explains in a timid tone—.</t4656> <t4657>Then I expanded the field of activities.</t4657>
<t4658>I am surprised by the fact that, although I know he is a commander, I don't know what he is a Commander of.</t4658> <t4659>What does he control, what is his field, as they used to say?</t4659> <t4660>They don't have specific titles.</t4660>
<t4661>—Ah —I say, pretending to understand.</t4661>
<t4662>—You could say that I am a kind of scientist —he adds—.</t4662> <t4663>Within certain limits, of course.</t4663>
<t4664>Afterwards, he doesn't say anything for a while, and neither do I.</t4664> <t4665>We wait for each other.</t4665>
<t4666>Finally, it is I who breaks the silence.</t4666>
<t4667>—Well, maybe you could explain something I've been wondering about for a long time.</t4667>
<t4668>He shows interest.</t4668>
<t4669>—What is it?</t4669>
<t4670>I am taking a risk, but I cannot hold myself back.</t4670>
<t4671>—It is a phrase that I remember from somewhere —it's better not to say from where—.</t4671> <t4672>I think it is in Latin, and I thought maybe... —I know you have a Latin dictionary.</t4672> <t4673>You have several dictionaries on the top shelf, to the left of the fireplace.</t4673>
<t4674>—Tell me —he urges me, distant but more alert, or is it my imagination?</t4674>
<t4675>—Don't let the bastards grind you down —I recite.</t4675>
<t4676>—What? —he exclaims in astonishment.</t4676>
<t4677>I haven't pronounced it correctly.</t4677> <t4678>I don't know how to pronounce it.</t4678>
<t4679>—I could spell it out —I suggest—.</t4679> <t4680>Or write it down.</t4680>
<t4681>She hesitated before this novel idea.</t4681> <t4682>Maybe she doesn't remember that I know how to write.</t4682> <t4683>I have never picked up a pen or a pencil inside this room, not even to add up the points.</t4683> <t4684>Women don't know how to add, he said once, jokingly.</t4684> <t4685>When I asked him what he meant, he replied: For them, One plus one plus one plus one does not equal four.</t4685>
<t4686>—What is it equal to? —I asked him, assuming he would say Five, or three.</t4686>
<t4687>—Simply one plus one plus one plus one —he concluded</t4687>
<t4688>But now he/she responds to me:</t4688>
<t4689>—Alright —and he throws his pen over the desk at me in an almost defiant manner, as if accepting a challenge.</t4689> <t4690>I look around for something to write on and he hands me the score pad, a stack of papers with a small smile printed at the top of the sheet.</t4690> <t4691>They still make those things.</t4691>
<t4692>I write the sentence carefully, reviewing it in my mental archive.</t4692><t4693>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t4693><t4694>In this context, it is neither a prayer nor an order, but a sad inscription once scribbled and then forgotten.</t4694><t4695>I perceive the sensuality of the pen between my fingers, almost as if it were alive, I notice its energy, the power of the words it contains.</t4695><t4696>Pen is synonymous with Envy, said Lydia quoting another motto of the Center, warning us to stay away from such objects.</t4696><t4697>And they were right, it is synonymous with envy.</t4697><t4698>The mere act of holding it produces envy.</t4698><t4699>I envy the Commander's pen.</t4699><t4700>It is another thing I would like to steal.</t4700>
<t4701>The Commander takes the sheet of the smile from my hand and looks at it.</t4701> <t4702>Then he bursts out laughing, does he blush?</t4702>
<t4703>—It's not authentic Latin —he states—.</t4703> <t4704>It's just a joke.</t4704>
<t4705>—A joke? —I asked, puzzled.</t4705> <t4706>It can't be just a joke.</t4706> <t4707>Have I taken this risk, asked questions just for a joke?—.</t4707> <t4708>What kind of joke?</t4708>
<t4709>—You know how schoolboys are —he comments.</t4709> <t4710>Now I understand that his laughter is nostalgic, it is a laugh of indulgence towards his former self.</t4710> <t4711>He stands up, approaches the bookshelf, and grabs a book from his loot; but it is not the dictionary.</t4711> <t4712>It is an old book, it looks like a textbook, with the corners of the pages folded and stained with ink.</t4712>
<t4713>Before showing it to me, he leafs through it with a contemplative and evocative attitude; then he says</t4713>
<t4714>—: Here —and he leaves it open on the desk, in front of me.</t4714>
<t4715>The first thing I see is an illustration, a black and white photo of the Venus de Milo, with a mustache, a black bra, and awkwardly drawn armpit hair.</t4715>
<t4716>On the next page, you can see the Colosseum of Rome, with a caption written in English, and below it a conjugation: sum es est, sumus estis sunt.</t4716>
<t4717>—There —he says, pointing to the margin, where it is written with the same ink used for Venus's hair: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t4717>
<t4718>—It's a bit difficult to explain where the humor lies unless you know Latin —</t4718>
<t4719>he clarifies—.</t4719> <t4720>We used to write all kinds of things this way.</t4720> <t4721>I don't know where we got it from, maybe from the older kids —he flips through the pages, forgetting about me and himself—.</t4721> <t4722>Look at this —he suggests.</t4722> <t4723>The illustration is called The Sabines, and in the margin, you can see the inscription: chul chus chut, chulum chuchus chu pat—.</t4723> <t4724>And there was another</t4724>
<t4725>—he adds—.</t4725> <t4726>Pim pis pit... —he interrupts himself, returning to the present, disturbed.</t4726> <t4727>He smiles again; this time it is like a grimace.</t4727> <t4728>I imagine him with freckles and a cowlick in his hair.</t4728> <t4729>At this moment, I almost like him.</t4729>
<t4730>—But what did it mean? —I ask.</t4730>
<t4731>—Which one? —he says—.</t4731> <t4732>Oh. It meant "Don't let the bastards burn you."</t4732>
<t4733>I suppose that back then we thought we were very smart.</t4733>
<t4734>I force a smile, but now everything seems clear to me.</t4734> <t4735>I understand why she wrote the phrase on the closet wall, but I also understand that she must have learned it here, in this room.</t4735> <t4736>What other explanation could there be?</t4736> <t4737>She was never a schoolgirl.</t4737> <t4738>With him, during some previous stage of childhood memories, of exchanging confidences.</t4738> <t4739>So I am not the first to penetrate her silence, to play with him childish word games.</t4739>
<t4740>—What happened to her?</t4740>
<t4741>He barely understands my question...</t4741>
<t4742>—Did you know her?</t4742>
<t4743>—A little —I lie to him.</t4743>
<t4744>—He hanged himself —he says in a tone more reflective than sorrowful—.</t4744> <t4745>That's why we removed the light installation from your room —he pauses—.</t4745> <t4746>Serena discovered it —</t4746>
<t4747>he continues, as if it were an explanation.</t4747> <t4748>And it is.</t4748>
<t4749>If your dog dies, buy another one.</t4749>
<t4750>—With what? —I ask him.</t4750>
<t4751>He doesn't want to give me any ideas.</t4751>
<t4752>—What does it matter? —he responds.</t4752> <t4753>With a piece of sheet, I imagine.</t4753> <t4754>I've already considered the possibilities.</t4754>
<t4755>—I suppose it was Cora who found him —I commented.</t4755> <t4756>That's why she screamed.</t4756>
<t4757>—Yes —he says—.</t4757> <t4758>Poor thing —he refers to Cora.</t4758>
<t4759>—Maybe I should never come again —I suggest.</t4759>
<t4760>—I thought you were having a good time —he says in a barely audible voice, looking at me intently.</t4760> <t4761>If I didn't know him, I would think it was fear—.</t4761> <t4762>That's what I intended.</t4762>
<t4763>—He wants to make my life bearable —I point out.</t4763> <t4764>It doesn't sound like a question but rather a categorical statement, without dimensions.</t4764> <t4765>If my life is bearable, maybe what they are doing is the right thing, after all.</t4765>
<t4766>—Yes —he admits—.</t4766> <t4767>That's right.</t4767> <t4768>I would prefer it.</t4768>
<t4769>—Well then —I continue.</t4769> <t4770>Things have changed.</t4770> <t4771>Now I know something about him.</t4771> <t4772>What I know is the possibility of my own death.</t4772> <t4773>What I know about him is his guilt.</t4773> <t4774>At last.</t4774>
<t4775>—What do you want? —he asks, still in a low voice, as if it were simply a commercial transaction, and an insignificant one at that; sweets, cigarettes.</t4775>
<t4776>"Do you mean besides the hand lotion?" I ask.</t4776>
<t4777>—Besides the hand lotion —he confirms.</t4777>
<t4778>—I would like...</t4778> <t4779>I would like to know —it sounds like an indefinite, even stupid phrase, I tell him without thinking.</t4779>
<t4780>—Know what?</t4780>
<t4781>—Everything there is to know —I assert, but that is too arrogant—.</t4781> <t4782>What is happening.</t4782>
<t4783>XI</t4783>
<t4784>THE NIGHT</t4784>
<t4785>CHAPTER 30</t4785>
<t4786>Night falls, or has fallen.</t4786> <t4787>Why does the night fall, instead of rising, like the dawn?</t4787> <t4788>Because if one looks to the east, at dusk, one can see how the night rises, instead of falling; and the darkness rising in the sky, from the horizon, like a black sun behind a veil of clouds.</t4788> <t4789>Like the smoke from an invisible fire, a line of fire exactly below the horizon, a brushstroke of fire or a city in flames.</t4789> <t4790>Perhaps the night falls because it is heavy, a thick curtain drawn over the eyes.</t4790> <t4791>A woolen mantle.</t4791> <t4792>I would like to see in the dark better than I do.</t4792>
<t4793>The night has fallen, then.</t4793> <t4794>I feel it crushing me, like a tombstone.</t4794> <t4795>Not a breeze is stirring.</t4795> <t4796>I sit by the partially open window, with the curtains drawn back —because there is no one outside, and it is not necessary to act modestly—; I am wearing the nightgown that even in summer has long sleeves to keep us away from the temptations of our own flesh, to avoid caressing our bare arms.</t4796> <t4797>Everything remains still under the moonlight.</t4797> <t4798>The scent of the garden rises like the heat emitted by a body, there must be flowers that open at night, that's why it is so strong.</t4798> <t4799>I can almost see it, a red radiation wavering upward like the shimmering glow of tar on the road at midday.</t4799>
<t4800>Down on the grass, someone emerges from beneath the cloak of darkness cast by the willow, and takes a few steps towards the light, with their long shadow stubbornly clinging to their heels.</t4800> <t4801>Is it Nick, or is it someone else, someone unimportant?</t4801>
<t4802>He stops, looks at my window, I manage to see the white rectangle of his face.</t4802> <t4803>Nick.</t4803> <t4804>We look at each other.</t4804> <t4805>I don't have a rose to throw to him, and he doesn't have a lute.</t4805> <t4806>But it's the same kind of longing.</t4806>
<t4807>Something I cannot allow.</t4807> <t4808>I pull the curtain on the left and it falls in front of my face, and a moment later he keeps walking and disappears around the corner of the house.</t4808>
<t4809>What the Commander said is true.</t4809> <t4810>One plus one plus one plus one is not equal to four.</t4810> <t4811>Each one remains unique, there is no way to unite them.</t4811> <t4812>They cannot be exchanged for one another.</t4812> <t4813>They cannot be replaced by one another.</t4813> <t4814>Nick for Luke, or Luke for Nick.</t4814> <t4815>The conditional does not apply here.</t4815>
<t4816>One cannot help feeling what one feels, Moira once said, but one can make amends for their actions.</t4816>
<t4817>Which is very good.</t4817>
<t4818>Context is everything; or was it maturity?</t4818> <t4819>One or the other.</t4819>
<t4820>The night before leaving our house for the last time, I was wandering through the rooms.</t4820> <t4821>We didn't pack anything because we weren't going to take many things and even then we couldn't afford to give the slightest impression that we were leaving.</t4821> <t4822>So I was simply wandering back and forth, looking at the things, the order that we had created together in our life.</t4822> <t4823>It occurred to me that later on I would be able to remember how they had been.</t4823>
<t4824>Luke was in the living room.</t4824> <t4825>He took me in his arms.</t4825> <t4826>We both felt miserable.</t4826> <t4827>How did we know we were happy, even then?</t4827> <t4828>Because at least we had that: our embraces.</t4828>
<t4829>The cat, that's what she said.</t4829>
<t4830>"The cat?" I asked her, pressed against the wool of her sweater.</t4830>
<t4831>We can't just leave her here.</t4831>
<t4832>I had not thought about the cat.</t4832> <t4833>Neither of us had thought.</t4833> <t4834>We had made the decision suddenly, and then we had to plan things.</t4834>
<t4835>I must have thought that we would take her with us.</t4835> <t4836>But we couldn't, you don't take the cat when you cross the border for a day, to go for a walk.</t4836>
<t4837>Why don't we leave her outside?, I suggested.</t4837> <t4838>We could abandon her.</t4838>
<t4839>He would roam around the house and start meowing by the door.</t4839> <t4840>Someone might notice that we have left.</t4840>
<t4841>We could give it away, I suggested.</t4841> <t4842>To a neighbor.</t4842> <t4843>As I said it, I realized it would have been a stupid idea.</t4843>
<t4844>I'll take care of that, decided Luke.</t4844> <t4845>He said that instead of her, and I knew he meant killing her.</t4845> <t4846>That's what one has to do before killing, I thought.</t4846> <t4847>One has to create something where there was nothing before.</t4847> <t4848>First, it's done mentally, and then in reality.</t4848> <t4849>So that's how they do it, I thought.</t4849> <t4850>It seemed to me that I had never known that.</t4850>
<t4851>Luke found the cat, which was hiding under the bed.</t4851> <t4852>They always know it.</t4852> <t4853>He took her to the garage.</t4853> <t4854>I don't know what he did, and I never asked him.</t4854> <t4855>I stayed seated in the living room, with my hands crossed on my lap.</t4855> <t4856>I should have gone out with him, taken on that small responsibility.</t4856> <t4857>At least I should have asked him afterward, so that he wouldn't have to bear the burden alone; because that small sacrifice, that annihilation of love, was also done for me.</t4857>
<t4858>That is one of the things they do.</t4858> <t4859>They force you to kill inside yourself.</t4859>
<t4860>Uselessly, as it was demonstrated.</t4860> <t4861>I wonder who informed them.</t4861> <t4862>It could have been a neighbor who saw us leave in the car in the morning and had a hunch and dropped the information to add a gold star to someone's list.</t4862> <t4863>It could even have been the guy who got us the passports; why not get paid twice?</t4863> <t4864>Even putting the passport forgers themselves, a trap for the unwary.</t4864> <t4865>The Eyes of God roam the earth in all its extent.</t4865>
<t4866>Because they were prepared to catch us, and waiting for us.</t4866> <t4867>The moment of betrayal is the worst, the moment when one knows, beyond any doubt, that one has been betrayed: that another human being has wished so many misfortunes upon them.</t4867>
<t4868>It was like being in an elevator whose cables have been cut.</t4868> <t4869>Falling and falling without knowing when it will crash.</t4869>
<t4870>I try to conjure, to evoke my own spirits, wherever they are.</t4870> <t4871>I need to remember what they looked like.</t4871> <t4872>I try to keep them still behind my eyes, their faces like the photos in an album.</t4872> <t4873>But they refuse to stay still, they move, a smile and it immediately disappears, their features curve and fold like burning paper, the blackness devours them.</t4873> <t4874>A momentary vision, a pale glow in the air; blush, dawn, dance of electrons, another face, faces.</t4874> <t4875>But they fade away, and although I stretch my arms towards them, they slip away like ghosts at dawn, returning to the place from which they came.</t4875> <t4876>Stay with me, I feel like saying.</t4876> <t4877>But they don't hear me.</t4877>
<t4878>It's my fault.</t4878> <t4879>I'm forgetting too many things.</t4879>
<t4880>Tonight I will say my prayers.</t4880>
<t4881>I no longer kneel at the foot of the bed, on the hard wooden floor of the gymnasium, while Aunt Elizabeth stands by the double doors, arms crossed and the cattle prod hanging from her belt, and Aunt Lydia paces along the rows of kneeling women dressed in nightgowns, lightly hitting our backs or feet or buttocks or arms, just a touch, a tap with the wooden pointer if we slackened or relaxed.</t4881> <t4882>She wanted us to have our heads perfectly bowed, the tips of our feet together, and our elbows forming the correct angle.</t4882> <t4883>Partly, her interest was aesthetic: she liked the appearance of the thing.</t4883> <t4884>She wanted us to look like something Anglo-Saxon, carved on a tomb; or angels from a Christmas postcard, uniformed in our robes of purity.</t4884> <t4885>But she also knew the value of bodily rigidity, the tautness of muscle: pain clarifies the mind, she said.</t4885>
<t4886>We prayed for emptiness, to make ourselves worthy of being filled: with grace, with love, with selflessness, with semen and children.</t4886>
<t4887>Oh God, King of the universe, thank you for not having made me a man.</t4887>
<t4888>Oh God, destroy me.</t4888> <t4889>Make me fertile.</t4889> <t4890>Mortify my flesh so that I may multiply.</t4890> <t4891>Allow me to fulfill myself...</t4891>
<t4892>Some became exalted with the prayers.</t4892> <t4893>It was the ecstasy of degradation.</t4893> <t4894>Some moaned and cried.</t4894>
<t4895>There is no need for you to put on a show, Janine, said Aunt Lydia.</t4895>
<t4896>Now I pray sitting by the window, looking at the garden through the curtain.</t4896> <t4897>I don't even close my eyes.</t4897> <t4898>Out there, or inside my head, the same darkness reigns.</t4898>
<t4899>Or the light.</t4899>
<t4900>My God, You who are in the Kingdom of Heaven, which is within.</t4900>
<t4901>I would like you to tell me Your Name, I mean the real one.</t4901> <t4902>Although You will also do.</t4902>
<t4903>I would like to know that You are up there.</t4903> <t4904>But wherever You are, help me get through this, please.</t4904> <t4905>Although maybe it's not Your task; I don't remotely believe that what is happening here is what You wanted.</t4905>
<t4906>I have enough bread every day, so I won't waste time on that.</t4906> <t4907>It's not the main problem.</t4907> <t4908>The problem is swallowing it without choking.</t4908>
<t4909>Now comes forgiveness.</t4909> <t4910>Don't bother forgiving me right now.</t4910> <t4911>There are more important things.</t4911> <t4912>For example: keep others safe, if they are safe.</t4912> <t4913>Don't let them suffer too much.</t4913> <t4914>If they have to die, make sure it's quick.</t4914>
<t4915>You can even make a Heaven for them.</t4915> <t4916>For that, we need You.</t4916> <t4917>We can make Hell ourselves.</t4917>
<t4918>I suppose I should say that I forgive whoever has done this, whoever they may be, and what they are doing now, whatever it may be.</t4918> <t4919>I will try, although it is not easy.</t4919>
<t4920>Then comes the temptation.</t4920> <t4921>In the Center, temptation meant much more than eating or sleeping.</t4921> <t4922>That which you do not know will not tempt you, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t4922>
<t4923>Maybe I don't really want to know what's happening.</t4923> <t4924>Maybe it will be better if I don't know.</t4924> <t4925>Maybe I couldn't bear to know.</t4925> <t4926>The Fall was a fall from innocence to knowledge.</t4926>
<t4927>I think a lot about the spider, although it is no longer there now.</t4927> <t4928>But I could use a hanger from the closet.</t4928> <t4929>I have analyzed the possibilities.</t4929> <t4930>All that would need to be done after tying oneself would be to lean the weight forward and not offer resistance.</t4930>
<t4931>Deliver us from evil.</t4931>
<t4932>Then there exists a Kingdom, power, and glory.</t4932> <t4933>It is difficult to believe in that now.</t4933> <t4934>But I will try anyway.</t4934> <t4935>With hope, as it said on the tombstone.</t4935>
<t4936>You must feel quite torn.</t4936> <t4937>I suppose it's not the first time.</t4937>
<t4938>If I were you, I would be fed up.</t4938> <t4939>I would really get sick.</t4939> <t4940>I suppose that is the difference between us.</t4940>
<t4941>I feel unreal talking to you this way.</t4941> <t4942>I feel the same as if I were talking to a wall.</t4942> <t4943>I wish you would answer me.</t4943> <t4944>I feel so alone.</t4944>
<t4945>Completely alone next to the phone.</t4945> <t4946>Except that I don't have a phone.</t4946> <t4947>And if I had one, who could I call?</t4947>
<t4948>Oh God.</t4948> <t4949>This is no joke.</t4949> <t4950>Oh God oh God.</t4950> <t4951>How can I keep living?</t4951>
<t4952>XII</t4952>
<t4953>JEZEBEL'</t4953><t4954>S</t4954>
<t4955>CHAPTER 31</t4955>
<t4956>Every night, when I go to sleep, I think: Tomorrow morning I will wake up in my own house and things will be as they were.</t4956>
<t4957>This morning it hasn't happened either.</t4957>
<t4958>I dress in my summer clothes, we are still in summer; it's as if time has stopped in the summer.</t4958> <t4959>July: during the day you can't breathe and at night it feels like you're in a sauna, it's hard to sleep.</t4959> <t4960>I impose upon myself the obligation not to lose track of time.</t4960> <t4961>I should mark lines on the wall, one for each day of the week, and cross them out with a line when I reach seven.</t4961> <t4962>But what sense would that make, this isn't a prison sentence; it's not something that ends after a certain amount of time.</t4962> <t4963>Anyway, what I have to do is ask, find out what day it is.</t4963> <t4964>Yesterday was July 4th, which used to be Independence Day, before they abolished it.</t4964> <t4965>September 1st will be Mother's Day, which is still celebrated.</t4965> <t4966>Although before it had nothing to do with procreation.</t4966>
<t4967>But I know the time by the moon.</t4967> <t4968>Lunar time, not solar.</t4968>
<t4969>I bend down to tie my shoes; these days they are lighter, with discreet openings, although not as daring as sandals.</t4969> <t4970>Bending down takes effort; despite the exercises, I feel my body gradually stiffening and becoming useless.</t4970> <t4971>This is how I used to imagine life would be when I got old.</t4971> <t4972>I feel like I even walk like an old woman: hunched over, with my spine bent like a question mark, my bones weakened by lack of calcium and porous like limestone.</t4972> <t4973>When I was young and imagined old age, I thought: Maybe one appreciates things more when they have little time left to live.</t4973>
<t4974>But I forgot to include the loss of energy.</t4974> <t4975>Sometimes I appreciate things more: the eggs, the flowers, but then I decide that it's just a bout of sentimentality, and that my brain turns into a technicolor movie with pastel tones, like the sunset postcards that used to be abundant in California.</t4975>
<t4976>Hearts of tinsel.</t4976>
<t4977>Danger is gray.</t4977>
<t4978>I would like Luke to be here, in this room while I get dressed, and have a fight with him.</t4978> <t4979>It seems absurd, but that's what I want.</t4979> <t4980>An argument about who puts the dishes in the dishwasher, whose turn it is to sort the dirty laundry, scrub the sink; something everyday and insignificant about the scheduling of things.</t4980> <t4981>We could even argue about that, the important and the insignificant.</t4981> <t4982>It would be a real pleasure.</t4982>
<t4983>It's not that we did it very often.</t4983> <t4984>In recent times, I mentally draft the entire argument, and also the subsequent reconciliation.</t4984>
<t4985>I sit in the chair; the crown of the ceiling floats above my head like a frozen halo, like a zero.</t4985> <t4986>A hole in space, where a star exploded.</t4986> <t4987>A circle in the water, where a stone has fallen.</t4987> <t4988>All white and circular things.</t4988>
<t4989>I hope the day unfolds, that the earth turns according to the round face of the relentless clock.</t4989> <t4990>Geometric days that turn over and over again, smoothly lubricated.</t4990> <t4991>My upper lip drenched in sweat, I await the arrival of the inevitable egg, which will be warm like the room and will have a yolk covered by a green film and will have a horrible sulfur taste.</t4991>
<t4992>Today, later, with Deglen, during our walk to do the shopping: We go to the church, as usual, and look at the tombstones.</t4992> <t4993>Then we visit the Wall.</t4993> <t4994>Today there are only two hanged: a Catholic —who is not a priest—, with a cross placed upside down, and another from a sect I do not recognize.</t4994> <t4995>The body is marked only with a red J.</t4995> <t4996>It does not mean Jew: in that case, they would put yellow stars.</t4996> <t4997>Anyway, there had not been many Jews.</t4997> <t4998>Since they were declared Sons of Jacob, and therefore something special, they were given an alternative.</t4998> <t4999>They could convert or emigrate to Israel.</t4999> <t5000>Most of them emigrated, if you can believe the news.</t5000> <t5001>I saw them on television, boarding a freighter, leaning on the railings, dressed in their coats and black hats and long beards, trying to look as Jewish as possible, with clothes rescued from the past, the women with their heads covered by shawls, smiling and waving, a bit stiff, as if they were posing.</t5001> <t5002>And another image: that of the richest, lining up to catch the plane.</t5002> <t5003>Deglen says that many people escaped that way, pretending to be Jews; but that it was not easy, because of the tests they were subjected to, and because now they had become stricter.</t5003>
<t5004>Anyway, they don't hang anyone just for being Jewish.</t5004> <t5005>They hang the one who is a noisy Jew, who hasn't made their choice, or who has pretended to convert.</t5005> <t5006>They've also shown that on television: nighttime raids, secret treasures of Jewish objects taken from under the beds, Torahs, tallits, Stars of David.</t5006> <t5007>And the owners of these things, taciturn, unrepentant, pushed by the Eyes against the walls of their rooms while the somber voice of the announcer speaks to us off-screen about the perfidy and ingratitude of those people.</t5007>
<t5008>So, the J doesn't mean Jewish.</t5008> <t5009>What could it mean? Jehovah's Witness?</t5009>
<t5010>Jesuit?</t5010> <t5011>Whatever he was, this one is dead.</t5011>
<t5012>After this ritual visit, we continued on our way, as usual looking for some open space where we could talk.</t5012> <t5013>If you can call conversation these broken whispers, projected through the funnel of our white headdresses.</t5013> <t5014>It resembles more a telegram, a verbal semaphore.</t5014> <t5015>An amputated dialogue.</t5015>
<t5016>We can never stay in one place for too long.</t5016> <t5017>We don't want to get caught for loitering.</t5017>
<t5018>Today we turn in the opposite direction of Spiritual Scrolls, towards where there is a kind of open park with an old and enormous building, in late Victorian style with colored glass.</t5018> <t5019>It used to be called Memorial Hall, although I never knew in memory of what.</t5019> <t5020>Of those who died for something.</t5020>
<t5021>Moira once told me that it was the place where the students ate, in the early days of the university.</t5021> <t5022>If a woman entered, she told me, they would throw buns at her.</t5022>
<t5023>Why?, I asked her.</t5023> <t5024>Over time, Moira became increasingly well-versed in anecdotes of this kind.</t5024> <t5025>I wasn't very enthusiastic about this resentment towards the past.</t5025>
<t5026>To make her come out, replied Moira.</t5026>
<t5027>It was more like throwing peanuts to the elephants, I commented.</t5027>
<t5028>Moira burst into laughter; she could always do it.</t5028> <t5029>Exotic monsters, she said.</t5029>
<t5030>We stood staring at this building, whose shape is more or less like that of a church, a cathedral.</t5030> <t5031>Deglen says:</t5031>
<t5032>—I heard that this is where the Eyes organize their banquets.</t5032>
<t5033>—Who told you that? —I ask him.</t5033> <t5034>There is no one nearby, we can speak more freely, but we do so in a low voice, out of habit.</t5034>
<t5035>—A means of communication —he replies.</t5035> <t5036>He pauses, glances at me sideways, I feel a white flash as he moves his cap—.</t5036> <t5037>There is a password —he adds.</t5037>
<t5038>—A password?</t5038> <t5039>For what?</t5039>
<t5040>—To know —he explains to me—.</t5040> <t5041>Who is and who is not.</t5041>
<t5042>Although I don't understand what the point is for me to know it, I ask her:</t5042>
<t5043>—Which one is it?</t5043>
<t5044>—Mayday —he says—.</t5044> <t5045>I tried it with you once.</t5045>
<t5046>—Mayday —I repeat—.</t5046> <t5047>I remember the day.</t5047> <t5048>M’aidez.</t5048>
<t5049>—Don't use it unless it's necessary —Deglen warns me—.</t5049> <t5050>It's not convenient for us to know too much about the others who form the network.</t5050> <t5051>In case we get caught.</t5051>
<t5052>I find it hard to believe in these rumors, in these revelations, although at the same time I believe it.</t5052> <t5053>Then they seem improbable to me, even childish, like something one would do for fun; like a girls' club, like secrets in school.</t5053> <t5054>Or</t5054>
<t5055>like the spy novels I used to read on weekends, when I should have been finishing my homework, or like watching TV late at night.</t5055>
<t5056>Passwords, things that couldn't be told, people with secret identities, shady connections: it doesn't seem like this should be the true nature of the world.</t5056>
<t5057>But it is my own illusion, the remnants of a version of reality that I knew in other times.</t5057>
<t5058>And the networks.</t5058> <t5059>Network work, one of my mother's old phrases, an outdated jargon, out of fashion.</t5059> <t5060>Even at sixty years old, she did something she called that, although from what I could see, it meant nothing more than having lunch with another woman.</t5060>
<t5061>I say goodbye to Deglen at the corner.</t5061>
<t5062>—See you soon —he greets me.</t5062> <t5063>He walks away on the sidewalk and I go up the path, towards the house.</t5063> <t5064>I see Nick, who is wearing his cap tilted; today he doesn't even look at me.</t5064>
<t5065>Anyway, he must have been waiting for me to deliver his silent message, because as soon as he realizes that I have seen him, he gives the Whirlwind a final touch with the chamois and briskly walks towards the garage door.</t5065>
<t5066>I walk along the gravel path, between the grass beds.</t5066> <t5067>Serena Joy is sitting under the willow tree, in her chair, with the cane resting beside her.</t5067> <t5068>She is wearing a cool cotton dress.</t5068> <t5069>The color that corresponds to her is blue, a watercolor shade, not the red that I wear, which absorbs the heat and at the same time burns with it.</t5069>
<t5070>She is sitting in profile to me, knitting.</t5070> <t5071>How can she stand touching the wool in this heat?</t5071> <t5072>Maybe her skin has become insensitive, maybe she doesn't feel anything, as if it has been scalded.</t5072>
<t5073>I lower my gaze to the path and walk past her, hoping to be invisible, knowing that she will ignore me.</t5073> <t5074>But not this time.</t5074>
<t5075>—Offred —he calls me.</t5075>
<t5076>I stop, uncertain.</t5076>
<t5077>—Yes, you.</t5077>
<t5078>I turn my fragmented gaze towards her through the veil.</t5078> <t5079>"Come here."</t5079> <t5080>"I need you."</t5080>
<t5081>I walk across the grass and stop in front of her with my eyes downcast.</t5081>
<t5082>—You can sit down —she tells me—.</t5082> <t5083>Here, on the cushion.</t5083> <t5084>I need you to hold the yarn for me —she has a cigarette; the ashtray is next to her, on the grass, and she also has a cup of something, tea or coffee—.</t5084> <t5085>That room is devilishly closed.</t5085> <t5086>You need a bit of air —she comments.</t5086> <t5087>I sit down, put down the basket (strawberries again, chicken again) and take note of the swear word: something new.</t5087> <t5088>She adjusts the skein around my two outstretched hands and starts to wind.</t5088> <t5089>It seems as if I were tied up, handcuffed; rather, covered in cobwebs.</t5089> <t5090>The yarn is gray and has absorbed the moisture from the environment, it's like a baby's wet sheet and smells terribly of wet lamb.</t5090> <t5091>At least my hands will be coated with lanolin.</t5091>
<t5092>Serena keeps winding; she holds the lit cigarette to the side of her mouth, puffing on it and blowing out tempting clouds of smoke.</t5092> <t5093>She winds the yarn slowly and with difficulty —due to the progressive paralysis of her hands— but with determination.</t5093> <t5094>Perhaps for her, knitting represents a kind of exercise of will; perhaps it even causes her pain.</t5094> <t5095>Maybe she does it by medical prescription: ten rows of knit and ten of purl daily.</t5095> <t5096>Although she must do more than that.</t5096> <t5097>I see those evergreen trees and the geometric boys and girls from another perspective: as a testament to her stubbornness, as something not entirely despicable.</t5097>
<t5098>My mother didn't knit, or do anything like that.</t5098> <t5099>But every time she picked up things from the dry cleaner — her good blouses, her winter jackets — she kept the safety pins and made a chain with them.</t5099> <t5100>She would pin the chain somewhere — her bed, the pillow, the back of a chair, the oven mitt — so as not to lose it.</t5100> <t5101>Then she would forget about the safety pins.</t5101> <t5102>I would come across them anywhere in the house, in the houses; they were the traces of her presence, the remnants of some forgotten intention, like the signs of a road that leads nowhere.</t5102> <t5103>A return to domesticity.</t5103>
<t5104>—Well —says Serena.</t5104> <t5105>She interrupts the task, leaving my hands garlanded with animal hair, and takes the cigarette out of her mouth by its tip—.</t5105> <t5106>Still nothing?</t5106>
<t5107>I know what you are talking about.</t5107> <t5108>Between us, there aren't many topics of conversation; we don't have many things in common, except for this mysterious and uncertain detail.</t5108>
<t5109>—No —I respond—.</t5109> <t5110>Nothing.</t5110>
<t5111>—That's bad —she states.</t5111> <t5112>It's hard to imagine her with a baby.</t5112> <t5113>But the Marthas would take care of him most of the time.</t5113> <t5114>She would like me to be pregnant, for everything to be over and for me to get out of the way, and for the sweaty and humiliating entanglements, the triangles of flesh under the starry canopy of silver flowers, to end.</t5114> <t5115>Peace and quiet.</t5115> <t5116>I can't imagine any other explanation for her wishing me such good luck.</t5116>
<t5117>—Your time is running out —he points out.</t5117> <t5118>It's not a question, but a reality.</t5118>
<t5119>—Yes —I reply in a neutral tone.</t5119>
<t5120>He lights another cigarette, fumbling clumsily with the lighter.</t5120> <t5121>Definitely, the state of his hands is getting worse and worse.</t5121> <t5122>But it would be a mistake to offer him help, he would be offended.</t5122> <t5123>It would be a mistake to notice any weakness in him.</t5123>
<t5124>—Maybe he can't —she suggests.</t5124>
<t5125>I don't know who he is referring to.</t5125> <t5126>Is he referring to the Commander or to God?</t5126> <t5127>If he were talking about God, he would say he doesn't want to.</t5127> <t5128>In any case, it would be heresy.</t5128> <t5129>It is the women who are the only ones who cannot, who remain stubbornly closed, damaged, defective.</t5129>
<t5130>—No —I say—.</t5130> <t5131>Maybe he can't.</t5131>
<t5132>I look up; she looks down.</t5132> <t5133>It's the first time in a long while that we look each other in the eyes.</t5133> <t5134>Since we met.</t5134> <t5135>The moment lingers, cold and piercing.</t5135> <t5136>She is trying to figure out if I am up to the task or not.</t5136>
<t5137>—Maybe —he repeats, holding the cigarette that hasn't lit—.</t5137> <t5138>Perhaps you should try another way.</t5138>
<t5139>Will it mean on all fours</t5139>
<t5140>—In what way? —I ask him.</t5140> <t5141>I must maintain seriousness.</t5141>
<t5142>—With another man —he declares.</t5142>
<t5143>—You know I can't —I respond, careful not to reveal my irritation—.</t5143> <t5144>It goes against the law.</t5144> <t5145>You know what the punishment is.</t5145>
<t5146>—Yes —she states.</t5146> <t5147>She was prepared for this, she has everything planned—.</t5147> <t5148>I know that officially you can't.</t5148> <t5149>But it gets done.</t5149> <t5150>Women do it often.</t5150>
<t5151>Constantly.</t5151>
<t5152>—Do you mean with the doctors? —I asked, recalling the kind brown eyes, the hand stripped of its glove.</t5152> <t5153>The last time I went, there was another doctor.</t5153>
<t5154>Perhaps someone discovered the first one, or some woman betrayed him.</t5154> <t5155>Although they would not have believed her without having proof.</t5155>
<t5156>—Some do that —he explains to me in an almost affable but distant tone; it's as if we were deciding on a nail polish color—.</t5156> <t5157>That's how Dewarren did it.</t5157> <t5158>The wife knew, of course —he pauses, so I can absorb his words—.</t5158> <t5159>I would help you.</t5159> <t5160>I would make sure nothing went wrong.</t5160>
<t5161>He reflected.</t5161>
<t5162>—Not with a doctor —I say.</t5162>
<t5163>—No —she agrees, and for at least a moment we are like two friends, this could be the kitchen table, we could be talking about a boyfriend, about some feminine scheme of fun and flirting—.</t5163> <t5164>Sometimes they blackmail.</t5164>
<t5165>But it doesn't have to be a doctor.</t5165> <t5166>It could be someone we trust.</t5166>
<t5167>—Who? —I ask.</t5167>
<t5168>—I was thinking about Nick —he suggests in an almost soft tone of voice—.</t5168> <t5169>He has been with us for a long time.</t5169> <t5170>He is loyal.</t5170> <t5171>I could arrange it with him.</t5171>
<t5172>So he is the one who runs errands for him in the black market.</t5172> <t5173>Is this what he always gets in return?</t5173>
<t5174>—And the Commander? —I asked.</t5174>
<t5175>—Alright —he says in a firm tone with a definitive look, like the snap of a purse closing—.</t5175> <t5176>We won't tell him anything, right?</t5176>
<t5177>The idea hangs between us, almost invisible, almost tangible: heavy, shapeless, dark, like a kind of collusion, a kind of betrayal.</t5177> <t5178>She loves that baby.</t5178>
<t5179>—It's a risk —I point out—.</t5179> <t5180>More than that —it's my life that's at stake; but it will be sooner or later, one way or another, whether I do it or not.</t5180> <t5181>We both know it.</t5181>
<t5182>—You better do it —he advises me.</t5182> <t5183>And I think the same.</t5183>
<t5184>—Agreed —I accept—.</t5184> <t5185>Yes.</t5185>
<t5186>He leans forward.</t5186>
<t5187>—Maybe I could get something for you —he informs me.</t5187> <t5188>Because I've been a good girl—.</t5188> <t5189>Something that you want —he adds, almost in a coaxing tone.</t5189>
<t5190>—What is it? —I ask.</t5190> <t5191>Nothing comes to mind that I really want and that she is capable of giving me.</t5191>
<t5192>—A photo —she announces, as if she were offering me some youthful pleasure, an ice cream or a trip to the zoo.</t5192> <t5193>I lift my gaze again to look at her, puzzled—.</t5193> <t5194>Of her</t5194>
<t5195>—he specifies—.</t5195> <t5196>From your little one.</t5196> <t5197>But only maybe.</t5197>
<t5198>Then she knows where they have taken her, where they have her.</t5198> <t5199>She knew it all along.</t5199> <t5200>Something is obstructing my throat.</t5200> <t5201>The bitch, not telling me anything, not bringing me news, not the slightest bit of news.</t5201> <t5202>Not even suggesting it.</t5202> <t5203>She is like a stone, or made of iron, she has no idea.</t5203> <t5204>But I can't tell her all this, I can't lose sight of even something so small.</t5204> <t5205>I can't let this possibility slip away.</t5205> <t5206>I can't speak.</t5206>
<t5207>She is smiling with a flirtatious expression; a shadow of her original small-screen mannequin allure flickers on her face like a fleeting interference.</t5207>
<t5208>—It's devilishly hot to work with this, don't you think? —he says to me.</t5208>
<t5209>Take the wool away from my hands, where I had it all the time.</t5209> <t5210>Then he grabs the cigarette he has been playing with and with a somewhat clumsy movement places it in my hand and closes my fingers around it—.</t5210> <t5211>Get yourself a match —he suggests—.</t5211> <t5212>They are in the kitchen; you can ask Rita for one.</t5212> <t5213>Tell her I told you so.</t5213> <t5214>But only one —he adds mischievously—.</t5214> <t5215>We don't want to ruin your health!</t5215>
<t5216>CHAPTER 32</t5216>
<t5217>Rita is sitting at the kitchen table.</t5217> <t5218>In front of her, on the table, there is a glass bowl with ice cubes.</t5218> <t5219>Inside, radishes turned into flowers, roses, or tulips are floating.</t5219> <t5220>She is cutting some more on the cutting board with a paring knife, and her hands appear skillful but indifferent.</t5220> <t5221>The rest of her body is motionless, just like her face.</t5221> <t5222>It's as if she were doing it in her sleep.</t5222> <t5223>On the white enamel surface, there is a pile of washed but uncut radishes.</t5223> <t5224>Like Aztec hearts.</t5224>
<t5225>When I enter, he barely bothers to look up.</t5225>
<t5226>—You must have brought everything, I suppose —she says while I take out the packages for her to examine.</t5226>
<t5227>—Can you give me a match? —I ask him.</t5227> <t5228>It's surprising, but his unperturbed expression and furrowed brow make me feel like a small, begging creature, annoying and whiny.</t5228>
<t5229>—Matches? —he asks—.</t5229> <t5230>What do you need matches for?</t5230>
<t5231>—She said she could take one —I respond, without admitting that it's for the cigarette.</t5231>
<t5232>—Who said that? —she continues slicing radishes, without breaking the rhythm—.</t5232> <t5233>There is no reason for you to have matches.</t5233> <t5234>You could burn the house down.</t5234>
<t5235>—If you want, you can ask him —I suggest—.</t5235> <t5236>He is in the garden.</t5236>
<t5237>She rolls her eyes and looks at the ceiling, as if silently consulting some deity.</t5237> <t5238>Then she sighs, gets up heavily, and wipes her hands on the apron with ostentatious movements, to show me how annoying I am.</t5238> <t5239>She slowly approaches the cupboard above the sink, searches for the bunch of keys in her pocket, and opens the door.</t5239>
<t5240>—In summer we store them here —she says, as if talking to herself—.</t5240> <t5241>With this weather, there's no need to light the fire —I remember that in April, when the weather is colder, Cora lights the fires in the living room and the dining room.</t5241>
<t5242>The matches are made of wood and come in a cardboard box with a sliding lid, like the ones I used to keep and turn into drawers for the dolls.</t5242> <t5243>Rita opens the box and inspects it, as if deciding which one she will let me take.</t5243>
<t5244>—It's her business —he grumbles—.</t5244> <t5245>There's no point in telling her anything —he puts his enormous hand in the box, picks out a match, and hands it to me—.</t5245> <t5246>Now don't set anything on fire —he warns me—.</t5246> <t5247>Not even the curtains in your room.</t5247> <t5248>It's already too hot as it is.</t5248>
<t5249>—I won't do it —I reassure her—.</t5249> <t5250>It's not for that.</t5250>
<t5251>He doesn't even bother to ask me what it's for.</t5251>
<t5252>—I don't care if you eat it, or do something else —he states—.</t5252> <t5253>She said you could have one, so I'm giving it to you, that's all.</t5253>
<t5254>She moves away from me and sits back down at the table.</t5254> <t5255>Then she takes an ice cube from the bowl and puts it in her mouth.</t5255> <t5256>This is something unusual for her.</t5256> <t5257>I never saw her snacking while she works.</t5257>
<t5258>—You can take one too —he suggests—.</t5258> <t5259>It's a shame they make you wear all those covers on your head in this heat.</t5259>
<t5260>I am surprised: she almost never offers me things.</t5260> <t5261>Maybe she feels that, if I have been promoted to a category sufficient to be given a match, she can afford the luxury of having a detail with me.</t5261> <t5262>Have I suddenly become one of those people who need to be appeased?</t5262>
<t5263>—Thank you —I reply.</t5263> <t5264>I carefully put the match in the sleeve pocket where I have the cigarette, so it doesn't get wet, and I take a cube—.</t5264> <t5265>These radishes are lovely —I say in gratitude for the gift he has given me so spontaneously.</t5265>
<t5266>—I like to do things right, period —he states, once again in a grumpy tone—.</t5266> <t5267>Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense.</t5267>
<t5268>I walk hurriedly down the hallway and climb the stairs.</t5268> <t5269>I pass silently by the curved mirror in the foyer, a red shadow at the edge of my own field of vision, a red smoke specter.</t5269> <t5270>The smoke is in my mind, but I can already feel it in my mouth, descending into my lungs and filling me with a prolonged and lascivious sigh of cinnamon, and then the rush as the nicotine hits my bloodstream.</t5270>
<t5271>After so much time, it could hurt me.</t5271> <t5272>It wouldn't surprise me.</t5272> <t5273>But even that idea appeals to me.</t5273>
<t5274>As I walk down the hallway, I wonder where I could do it.</t5274> <t5275>In the bathroom, letting the water run to clear the air, or in the bedroom, letting the puffs escape through the open window?</t5275> <t5276>Will someone discover me?</t5276>
<t5277>Who knows?</t5277>
<t5278>While I delight in this way thinking about what is going to happen, anticipating the taste in my mouth, I think of something else.</t5278>
<t5279>I don't need to smoke this cigarette.</t5279>
<t5280>I could undo it and throw it in the toilet, or eat it and get high that way, that could also work, a little at a time, and save the rest.</t5280>
<t5281>That way I could keep the match.</t5281> <t5282>I could make a small hole in the mattress and slide it inside carefully.</t5282> <t5283>No one would ever notice such a small thing.</t5283> <t5284>And at night, when I go to bed, it would be underneath me.</t5284> <t5285>I would sleep on top of it.</t5285>
<t5286>I could set the house on fire.</t5286> <t5287>It's a good idea, it makes me tremble.</t5287>
<t5288>And I would barely escape.</t5288>
<t5289>I lie down on the bed and pretend to doze off.</t5289>
<t5290>Last night the Commander, with his fingers together, was watching me while I rubbed my hands with lotion.</t5290> <t5291>The strange thing is that I thought about asking him for a cigarette and then decided not to.</t5291> <t5292>I know I shouldn't ask for too many things at the same time.</t5292> <t5293>I don't want him to think I'm using him.</t5293> <t5294>I also don't want him to get tired.</t5294>
<t5295>Last night, he poured himself a glass of Scotch whisky with water.</t5295> <t5296>He has gotten used to drinking in my presence, to relax from the day's tension, he says.</t5296> <t5297>I deduce that he is under pressure.</t5297> <t5298>In any case, he never offers me a drink, nor do I ask for one: we both know what my body is for.</t5298> <t5299>When I give him a goodnight kiss, as if I were doing it for real, his breath smells of alcohol, and I inhale it as if it were smoke.</t5299>
<t5300>I admit that I enjoy this touch of dissipation.</t5300>
<t5301>Sometimes, after a few drinks, he gets silly and cheats at Intelect.</t5301>
<t5302>It encourages me to do it too, and then we pick some more letters and form words that don't exist, like chucrete and sucundún, and we laugh with them.</t5302> <t5303>Sometimes he turns on his shortwave radio and makes me listen to one or two minutes of Radio América Libre, to show me that he can do it.</t5303> <t5304>Then he turns it off.</t5304> <t5305>Damned Cubans, he protests.</t5305> <t5306>And all that universal daily filth.</t5306>
<t5307>Sometimes, after the games, she sits on the floor next to my chair and takes my hand.</t5307> <t5308>Her head is a little below mine, so when she looks at me, she shows a youthful angle.</t5308> <t5309>This false subordination must amuse her.</t5309>
<t5310>He is above, says Deglen.</t5310> <t5311>He is at the top, and I mean the very top.</t5311>
<t5312>In moments like that, it is difficult to imagine it.</t5312>
<t5313>From time to time, I try to put myself in his place.</t5313> <t5314>I do it as a tactic, to guess in advance how he feels inclined to treat me.</t5314> <t5315>I find it hard to believe that I have some kind of power over him, but I do.</t5315> <t5316>However, it is somewhat ambiguous.</t5316>
<t5317>From time to time, I think I can see myself, though blurry, just as he sees me.</t5317> <t5318>There are things he wants to show me, gifts he wants to give me, favors he wants to do for me, tenderness he wants to inspire.</t5318>
<t5319>He wants to, very well.</t5319> <t5320>Especially after a few drinks.</t5320>
<t5321>At times he becomes whiny, and at other moments philosophical; or he wants to explain things, to justify himself.</t5321> <t5322>Like last night.</t5322>
<t5323>The problem was not only for the women, he says.</t5323> <t5324>The main problem was for the men.</t5324> <t5325>There was nothing left for them.</t5325>
<t5326>Nothing?, I ask him.</t5326> <t5327>But they had...</t5327>
<t5328>They had nothing to do, he points out.</t5328>
<t5329>They could make money, he replied in a somewhat brusque tone.</t5329> <t5330>Now I don't fear him.</t5330> <t5331>It's hard to fear a man who is sitting watching you put lotion on your hands.</t5331> <t5332>This lack of fear is dangerous.</t5332>
<t5333>It's not enough, he says.</t5333> <t5334>It's something too abstract.</t5334> <t5335>I mean, they had nothing to do with the women.</t5335>
<t5336>"What do you mean?" I ask him.</t5336> <t5337>"And the Porncorners?"</t5337> <t5338>They were everywhere, they had even motorized them.</t5338>
<t5339>I'm not talking about sex, he clarifies.</t5339> <t5340>Sex was a part of it, and something too accessible.</t5340> <t5341>Anyone could buy it.</t5341> <t5342>There was nothing to work for, nothing to fight for.</t5342> <t5343>We have the statements from that time.</t5343> <t5344>Do you know what most people complained about?</t5344> <t5345>Inability to feel.</t5345> <t5346>Men even disconnected from sex.</t5346>
<t5347>The desire to get married was taken away from them.</t5347>
<t5348>And now do you feel?, I asked.</t5348>
<t5349>Yes, he affirms, looking at me.</t5349> <t5350>Of course they feel.</t5350> <t5351>He stands up and walks around the desk until he is next to my chair, behind me.</t5351> <t5352>He places his hands on my shoulders.</t5352> <t5353>I can't see him.</t5353>
<t5354>I would like to know what you think, says her voice behind me.</t5354>
<t5355>I don't think much, I respond weakly.</t5355> <t5356>What he wants are intimate relationships, but that is something I cannot give him.</t5356>
<t5357>What I think doesn't matter much, does it?, I imply.</t5357> <t5358>What I think doesn't count.</t5358>
<t5359>That is the only reason why they tell me things.</t5359>
<t5360>Come on, encourage me, lightly pressing my shoulders.</t5360> <t5361>I'm interested in your opinion.</t5361> <t5362>You are intelligent, you must have an opinion.</t5362>
<t5363>About what?, I ask.</t5363>
<t5364>About what we have done, specify.</t5364> <t5365>About how things have turned out.</t5365>
<t5366>I stay very still.</t5366> <t5367>I try to empty my mind.</t5367> <t5368>I think about the sky, at night, when there is no moon.</t5368> <t5369>I have no opinion, I affirm.</t5369>
<t5370>He sighs, loosens his hands but leaves them on my shoulders.</t5370> <t5371>He knows what I’m thinking.</t5371>
<t5372>You can't swim and keep your clothes dry, he declares.</t5372> <t5373>We thought we could make everything better.</t5373>
<t5374>Better?, I repeat in a low voice.</t5374> <t5375>How can he believe that this is better?</t5375>
<t5376>Better never means better for everyone, he comments.</t5376> <t5377>For some, it is always worse.</t5377>
<t5378>I lie down; the humid air covers me as if it were a lid.</t5378> <t5379>Like the earth.</t5379> <t5380>I wish it would rain.</t5380> <t5381>Better yet, that a storm would break out with lightning, black clouds, and deafening noises.</t5381> <t5382>And that the power would go out.</t5382> <t5383>Then I would go down to the kitchen, say that I am scared, and sit with Rita and Cora by the table, and they would understand my fear because it is the same one they feel, and they would let me stay.</t5383> <t5384>There would be some lit candles, and we would watch our faces come and go under the flicker and flashes of the jagged light coming through the window.</t5384> <t5385>Oh Lord, Cora would say.</t5385> <t5386>Oh Lord, protect us.</t5386>
<t5387>After that, the air would clear up and be more transparent.</t5387>
<t5388>I look at the flat ceiling, the circle of plaster flowers.</t5388> <t5389>Draw a circle and get inside it, it will protect you.</t5389> <t5390>In the center was the chandelier, and from the chandelier hung a piece of twisted sheet.</t5390> <t5391>That’s where she was swinging, slightly, like a pendulum; in the same way a child would swing from a tree branch.</t5391> <t5392>When Cora opened the door, she was safe, completely protected.</t5392> <t5393>Sometimes I think she is still here, with me.</t5393>
<t5394>I feel like I am buried.</t5394>
<t5395>CHAPTER 33</t5395>
<t5396>At the last hour of the afternoon, the sky is covered with clouds and the sunlight diffuses heavily, like powdered bronze.</t5396> <t5397>I slide along the sidewalk, with Deglen; the two of us, and in front of us another pair, and on the opposite sidewalk, another one.</t5397> <t5398>Seen from a distance, we must form a pretty picture: a pictorial image, like Dutch milkmaids from a wallpaper border, like a shelf full of ceramic salt and pepper shakers with period costume designs, like a flotilla of swans, or any other thing that repeats with a minimum of grace and without variation.</t5398>
<t5399>Relaxing for the sight, for the eyes, for the Eyes, because this demonstration is for them.</t5399> <t5400>We go out on Pilgrimage, to demonstrate how obedient and pious we are.</t5400>
<t5401>Not a single dandelion can be seen, the lawns have been carefully cleaned.</t5401> <t5402>I wish there were one, just one, insignificant and brazenly loose, hard to get rid of and perpetually yellow, like the sun.</t5402>
<t5403>Cheerful and common, shining equally for everyone.</t5403> <t5404>With them, we made rings, crowns, and necklaces, sour milk stains on our fingers.</t5404> <t5405>Or held it under her chin: Do you like butter?</t5405> <t5406>And when she smelled them, the pollen would get into her nose.</t5406> <t5407>(Or</t5407>
<t5408>was it the fluff?)</t5408> <t5409>I see her running on the grass, that grass that is exactly in front of me, at two or three years old, shaking it as if it were a sparkler, a small rod of white fire, and the air was filled with tiny parachutes.</t5409> <t5410>She blows and looks at the time.</t5410> <t5411>All the time carried away by the summer breeze.</t5411> <t5412>But they were daisies, and we plucked their petals.</t5412>
<t5413>We formed a line in front of the checkpoint, to be processed, always in pairs, like girls from a private school who have gone out for a walk and have been away too long, years and years, and everything has grown too much for them, their legs, their bodies, and along with these, their dresses.</t5413> <t5414>As if they were enchanted.</t5414> <t5415>As if it were a fairy tale, I would like to believe it.</t5415> <t5416>Instead, we are searched, in pairs, and we continue walking.</t5416>
<t5417>A while later, we turned right, passed by Azucenas, and went down towards the river.</t5417> <t5418>I would like to get there, to its wide banks, where we used to lie down to sunbathe, where the bridges rise.</t5418> <t5419>If you went down the river far enough, through its winding curves, you would reach the sea; and what could you do there?</t5419>
<t5420>Collecting shells and lying down on the smooth stones.</t5420>
<t5421>However, we are not going to the river, we will not see the small domes of the buildings along the way, white with blue and a golden ornament, a sober expression of joy.</t5421> <t5422>We turn into a more modern building, which above the door has a huge decorated flag, on which it reads: TODAY, PILGRIMAGE OF</t5422>
<t5423>WOMEN.</t5423> <t5424>The flag covers the original name of the building, that of some president who was shot to death.</t5424> <t5425>Beneath the red letters, there is a line of smaller letters, in black, with the profile of a winged eye at each end, and it reads: GOD</t5425>
<t5426>IT IS A NATIONAL RESERVE.</t5426> <t5427>On each side of the entrance are the inevitable Guardians, two pairs, four in total, with their arms at their sides and their gaze straight ahead.</t5427> <t5428>They almost look like mannequins, with clean hair, ironed uniforms, and their young plaster-like faces.</t5428> <t5429>These ones don't have pimples on their faces.</t5429> <t5430>Each one carries a machine gun ready for any dangerous or subversive act we might commit inside.</t5430>
<t5431>The Pilgrimage ceremony will be held in a covered courtyard that has a rectangular space and a roof with a skylight.</t5431> <t5432>It is not a Pilgrimage for the whole city; in that case, it would be held in the football field. It is only for this district.</t5432> <t5433>Along the right side, rows of wooden folding chairs have been placed for the Wives and the daughters of high-ranking officers or officials; there is not much difference.</t5433> <t5434>The upper galleries, with their concrete railings, are for the women of lower rank, the Marthas, the Econowives with their multicolored stripes.</t5434>
<t5435>Attendance at the Pilgrimage is not mandatory for them, especially if they are on duty or have small children, but nonetheless, the galleries are crowded.</t5435> <t5436>I suppose it is a form of distraction like a show or a circus.</t5436>
<t5437>There are already many Wives seated, dressed in their best embroidered blue dresses.</t5437>
<t5438>As we walk in our red dresses, two by two, to the opposite side, we can feel their eyes fixed on us.</t5438> <t5439>We are observed, evaluated, they make comments about us; and we notice it as if they were tiny ants crawling over our bare skin.</t5439>
<t5440>There are no chairs here.</t5440> <t5441>Our area is cordoned off with twisted silk rope, scarlet in color, like the kind they used to put in cinemas to prevent the public from passing.</t5441>
<t5442>This rope isolates us, distinguishes us, prevents others from being contaminated by us, forms a corral, a pigsty in which we enter and distribute ourselves in rows, kneeling on the cement floor.</t5442>
<t5443>—Come to the back —murmurs Deglen beside me—.</t5443> <t5444>We can talk better there.</t5444> <t5445>We kneel and slightly bow our heads; I hear a whisper around me, like the whisper of insects over dry grass: a cloud of murmurs.</t5445> <t5446>This is one of the places where we can exchange news more freely, passing it from one to another.</t5446> <t5447>It is difficult for them to single us out or hear what we say.</t5447> <t5448>And they are not interested in interrupting the ceremony, especially not in front of the television cameras.</t5448>
<t5449>Deglen elbows me to get my attention, and I look up, slowly and cautiously.</t5449> <t5450>From where we are kneeling, we have a good view of the entrance to the courtyard, where people keep arriving.</t5450> <t5451>Deglen must want me to look at Janine, who is paired with a woman who is not the usual one; she is someone I don't recognize.</t5451> <t5452>So Janine must have been transferred to a new house, a new assignment.</t5452> <t5453>It's very soon for that, or could something have gone wrong with the milk from her breasts?</t5453> <t5454>That would be the only reason for her to be transferred, unless there had been some fight over the baby, which happens more often than one might imagine.</t5454> <t5455>After having it, she might have refused to give it up.</t5455> <t5456>It's understandable.</t5456>
<t5457>Under the red dress, her body looks very thin, almost gaunt, and has lost the glow of pregnancy.</t5457> <t5458>Her face is white and gaunt, as if all the fluid had been drained from her body.</t5458>
<t5459>—It didn't go well, you know? —Deglen tells me, bringing his head closer to mine—.</t5459>
<t5460>It was like a rag.</t5460>
<t5461>It refers to Janine's baby, the baby that passed through Janine's life on its way to somewhere else.</t5461> <t5462>Baby Angela.</t5462> <t5463>It was a mistake to give it a name so soon.</t5463> <t5464>I feel a pain in the pit of my stomach.</t5464> <t5465>It's not a pain, it's an emptiness.</t5465> <t5466>I don't want to know what went wrong.</t5466>
<t5467>—My God —I exclaimed.</t5467> <t5468>Going through all that for nothing.</t5468> <t5469>Worse than nothing.</t5469>
<t5470>—It's the second one —Deglen explains to me—.</t5470> <t5471>Not counting the one he had before.</t5471>
<t5472>She had a miscarriage at eight months, did you know?</t5472>
<t5473>We observe Janine, who crosses the cordoned-off area, dressed in her veil of untouchable bad luck.</t5473> <t5474>She looks at me, she must be looking at me, but she doesn't see me.</t5474> <t5475>She no longer smiles triumphantly.</t5475> <t5476>She turns and kneels, now all I see is her back and her thin, slumped shoulders.</t5476>
<t5477>—She thinks it's her fault —whispers Deglen—.</t5477> <t5478>Two in a row.</t5478> <t5479>For having sinned.</t5479> <t5480>They say she did it with a doctor, who wasn't her Commander’s.</t5480>
<t5481>I can't tell Deglen that I know, because she would ask me how I found out.</t5481> <t5482>As far as she knows, she is my only source for this kind of information; and it's surprising how much she knows.</t5482> <t5483>How did she find out about Janine? From the Marthas? From Janine's shopping partner?</t5483> <t5484>Or by listening behind doors, when the Wives gather to drink tea or wine and weave their fabrics.</t5484> <t5485>Will Serena Joy talk about me like that, if I do what she wants?</t5485> <t5486>She agreed right away, she really didn't care, anything with two legs and a good you-know-what is fine with them.</t5486> <t5487>They have no scruples, they don't have the same feelings as we do.</t5487> <t5488>And the others, sitting in their chairs, leaning forward, my God, all horror and lust.</t5488>
<t5489>How could it? Where? When?</t5489>
<t5490>As they undoubtedly did with Janine.</t5490>
<t5491>—It's terrible —I say.</t5491>
<t5492>Anyway, it is very typical of Janine to take on the responsibility, to decide that the baby's defect was solely her fault.</t5492> <t5493>But people are capable of anything rather than admitting that their lives are meaningless.</t5493> <t5494>It's useless.</t5494> <t5495>There is no conspiracy that matters.</t5495>
<t5496>One morning, while we were getting dressed, I noticed that Janine still had her nightgown on.</t5496> <t5497>She had remained sitting on the edge of her bed.</t5497>
<t5498>I glanced at the double doors of the gym, where there used to be an Aunt, to see if she had noticed, but there was no Aunt.</t5498> <t5499>At that time they trusted us more, and occasionally left us unsupervised in class, and even in the cafeteria, for a few minutes.</t5499> <t5500>They probably disappeared to smoke a cigarette or have a cup of coffee.</t5500>
<t5501>Look, I said to Alma, whose bed was next to mine.</t5501>
<t5502>Alma looked at Janine.</t5502> <t5503>Then the two of us approached her.</t5503> <t5504>Get dressed, Janine, Alma said to her back.</t5504> <t5505>We don't want to pray twice because of you.</t5505> <t5506>But Janine didn't move.</t5506>
<t5507>Moira had also approached.</t5507> <t5508>It was before she escaped for the second time.</t5508>
<t5509>He was still limping because of what they had done to his feet.</t5509> <t5510>He walked around the bed to be able to see Janine's face.</t5510>
<t5511>Come, he said to Alma and me.</t5511> <t5512>The others were also beginning to gather, forming a small crowd.</t5512> <t5513>Step aside, Moira told them.</t5513> <t5514>It's nothing to worry about.</t5514> <t5515>If she were to come in...</t5515>
<t5516>I was looking at Janine.</t5516> <t5517>Her eyes were open and wide, but she didn't see me; her mouth, open in a fixed smile.</t5517> <t5518>Through the smile, through her teeth, she was whispering something to herself.</t5518> <t5519>I had to lean towards her.</t5519>
<t5520>Hello, she said, without addressing me.</t5520> <t5521>My name is Janine.</t5521> <t5522>This morning I am your server.</t5522> <t5523>Shall I bring you some coffee to start?</t5523>
<t5524>Christ, said Moira beside me.</t5524>
<t5525>Don't blaspheme, Alma warned him.</t5525>
<t5526>Moira grabbed Janine by the shoulders and shook her.</t5526> <t5527>Forget it, Janine, she said brusquely.</t5527> <t5528>And don't say that word.</t5528>
<t5529>Janine smiled.</t5529> <t5530>It's a beautiful day, she said.</t5530>
<t5531>Moira gave him two slaps, with the back and front of her hand.</t5531> <t5532>Come back, she insisted.</t5532>
<t5533>Come back right now!</t5533> <t5534>You can't stay there, you're not there anymore.</t5534> <t5535>All of that is over.</t5535>
<t5536>Janine's smile broke.</t5536> <t5537>She brought her hand to her cheek.</t5537> <t5538>Why did you hit me?, she asked.</t5538> <t5539>Wasn't it good?</t5539> <t5540>I can bring you another one.</t5540> <t5541>You didn't need to hit me.</t5541>
<t5542>Don't you know what they will do?, Moira continued.</t5542> <t5543>She spoke in a low but harsh, deep voice.</t5543> <t5544>Look at me.</t5544> <t5545>My name is Moira and this is the Red Center.</t5545> <t5546>Look at me.</t5546>
<t5547>Janine began to focus her gaze.</t5547> <t5548>Moira? she said.</t5548> <t5549>I don't know any Moira.</t5549>
<t5550>They're not going to send you to the Infirmary, not a chance, continued Moira.</t5550> <t5551>They won't complicate their lives trying to cure you. They won't even bother to transfer you to the Colonies.</t5551> <t5552>At most, they'll take you up to the Laboratory and give you an injection.</t5552> <t5553>Then they'll burn you along with the garbage, like an Unwoman.</t5553> <t5554>So forget about it.</t5554>
<t5555>I want to go home, said Janine.</t5555> <t5556>And she burst into tears.</t5556>
<t5557>Jesus, protested Moira.</t5557> <t5558>That's enough.</t5558> <t5559>She'll be back in a minute, you can be sure of that.</t5559> <t5560>So put on your damn clothes and shut up.</t5560>
<t5561>Janine continued sobbing, but she stood up and began to get dressed.</t5561>
<t5562>If she does it again and I'm not here, Moira told me, you just have to slap her.</t5562>
<t5563>We must not allow him to lose his sense of reality.</t5563> <t5564>That shit is contagious.</t5564>
<t5565>Then he must have already been planning his escape.</t5565>
<t5566>CHAPTER 34</t5566>
<t5567>The space in the courtyard designated for the chairs is already filled; we fidget in our seats, impatient.</t5567> <t5568>Finally, the Commander in charge of the service arrives.</t5568> <t5569>He is bald and broad-shouldered, and he looks like an aging football coach.</t5569> <t5570>He is dressed in his soberly black uniform with several rows of badges and decorations.</t5570> <t5571>It's hard not to be impressed, but I make an effort: I try to imagine him in bed with his Wife and his Handmaid, fertilizing like crazy, like a salmon in heat, pretending he gets no pleasure from it.</t5571> <t5572>When the Lord said be fruitful and multiply, was he referring to this man?</t5572>
<t5573>The Commander climbs the staircase leading to the podium, adorned with a red cloth embroidered with a huge white eye with wings.</t5573> <t5574>He scans the room with his eyes and our voices fall silent.</t5574> <t5575>He doesn't even have to raise his hands.</t5575> <t5576>His voice enters the microphone and exits the speakers stripped of its lower tones, so it sounds harshly metallic, as if it were not emitted by his mouth, his body, but by the speakers themselves.</t5576> <t5577>His voice has the color of metal and the shape of a horn.</t5577>
<t5578>Today is a day of thanksgiving —it begins—, a day of prayer.</t5578>
<t5579>I disconnect my ears from the tirade about victory and sacrifice.</t5579> <t5580>Then there is a long prayer about unworthy vessels, and afterwards a hymn: "There is a balm in Gilead.</t5580> <t5581>"</t5581>
<t5582>"In Gilead, there's a bomb," Moira used to call it.</t5582>
<t5583>Now comes the most important part.</t5583> <t5584>The twenty Angels newly arrived from the fronts, recently decorated, enter accompanied by the honor guard, marching one-two one-two towards the central space.</t5584> <t5585>Attention, at ease.</t5585> <t5586>And then the twenty daughters with their white veils timidly advance, arm in arm with their mothers.</t5586> <t5587>Now it is the mothers, not the fathers, who give away the daughters and facilitate the wedding arrangements.</t5587> <t5588>The marriages, of course, are arranged.</t5588> <t5589>For years, these girls have not been allowed to be alone with a man; in some way, the same thing has happened to all of us for many years.</t5589>
<t5590>Are they old enough to remember anything from the past times, like playing baseball, wearing jeans and canvas shoes, riding a bicycle?</t5590> <t5591>And reading books, by themselves?</t5591> <t5592>Although some of them are no more than fourteen years old —Start them early, that's the rule, there's no time to lose—, they will still remember.</t5592> <t5593>And those who come after them, for three or four or five years, will also remember; but after that, no.</t5593> <t5594>They will have always dressed in white and formed groups of girls; they will have always kept silent.</t5594>
<t5595>We have given them more than we have taken from them, said the Commander.</t5595> <t5596>Think about the problems they had before.</t5596> <t5597>Do you not remember the difficulties of the singles, the indignity of dating strangers in secondary schools?</t5597> <t5598>The meat market.</t5598> <t5599>Do you not remember the huge difference between those who could easily get a man and those who couldn't?</t5599> <t5600>Some reached desperation, starved themselves to lose weight, filled their breasts with silicone, shrank their noses.</t5600> <t5601>Think about human misery.</t5601>
<t5602>He moved his hand towards the shelves of old magazines.</t5602> <t5603>They were always complaining.</t5603> <t5604>Problems because of this, problems because of that.</t5604> <t5605>He remembers the personal column ads: Cheerful and attractive woman, thirty-five years old...</t5605> <t5606>In this way, they all got a man, without excluding any.</t5606> <t5607>And then, if they got married, they could be abandoned with one child, two children, their husbands could get tired and leave, disappear, and they had to live on social assistance.</t5607> <t5608>Or otherwise, he would stay and beat them.</t5608> <t5609>Or, if they had a job, they had to leave the children in daycare or in the care of some cruel and ignorant woman, and they had to pay for it out of their pocket, with their miserable wages.</t5609> <t5610>Money was the only valuable measure for everyone that did not respect mothers.</t5610> <t5611>No wonder they gave up on the whole matter.</t5611> <t5612>In this way, they are protected, they can fulfill their biological destiny in peace.</t5612> <t5613>With full support and encouragement.</t5613> <t5614>Now tell me.</t5614> <t5615>You are an intelligent person, I would like to know what you think.</t5615> <t5616>What are we overlooking?</t5616>
<t5617>Love, I affirmed.</t5617>
<t5618>Love?, the Commander wondered.</t5618> <t5619>What kind of love?</t5619>
<t5620>Falling in love, I replied.</t5620>
<t5621>The Commander looked at me with his frank and childlike gaze.</t5621> <t5622>Oh yes, he said.</t5622> <t5623>I have read the magazines, it is what they promoted, right?</t5623> <t5624>But consider the testimonies, dear.</t5624> <t5625>Was it really worth falling in love?</t5625> <t5626>Arranged marriages have always worked perfectly well, at the very least.</t5626>
<t5627>Love, said Aunt Lydia in a disgusted tone.</t5627> <t5628>Don't let me catch you in that.</t5628> <t5629>No daydreaming, girls.</t5629> <t5630>Waving her finger in front of us.</t5630> <t5631>Love doesn't count.</t5631>
<t5632>Historically speaking, those years were simply an anomaly, argued the Commander.</t5632> <t5633>A fiasco.</t5633> <t5634>All we have done is return things to the course of Nature.</t5634>
<t5635>The Women's Pilgrimage is generally organized for group weddings, like this one.</t5635> <t5636>The men's pilgrimages are for military victories.</t5636> <t5637>This is one of the things that should rejoice us the most.</t5637> <t5638>However, on occasions, and in the case of women, they are organized when a nun decides to retract.</t5638> <t5639>Most of these cases took place at the beginning, when they were cornered; but even in these times, some are discovered, and they are made to leave hiding, where they have been burrowing like moles.</t5639> <t5640>And they look the same: weakened eyes, a dazed look from the excess of light.</t5640> <t5641>The older ones are sent directly to the Colonies, but the young and fertile ones are attempted to be converted and, when they succeed, we all come here to see them celebrate the ceremony of renouncing celibacy and sacrificing themselves for the common good.</t5641> <t5642>They kneel and the Commander prays and then they take the red veil, just as all of us have done.</t5642> <t5643>However, they are not allowed to become Wives.</t5643> <t5644>They are still considered too dangerous to access such positions of power.</t5644> <t5645>They seem surrounded by a witch's aura, something mysterious and exotic; something that remains in them despite the scrubbing and the sores on their feet, and the time they have spent isolated.</t5645> <t5646>They always have sores, they had them back then, or so it is rumored: they do not go away easily.</t5646> <t5647>Anyway, many of them choose the Colonies.</t5647> <t5648>None of us likes having them as shopping companions.</t5648> <t5649>They are more broken than the rest of us; it is difficult to feel comfortable with them.</t5649>
<t5650>The mothers have placed the girls adorned with white veils in their spots, and have returned to their seats.</t5650> <t5651>Among them, there is a brief whimpering, mutual pats and handshakes, and the ostentatious use of handkerchiefs.</t5651> <t5652>The Commander continues with the service:</t5652>
<t5653>—I desire that women adorn themselves with modest apparel —he says—, with decency and propriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothes;</t5653>
<t5654>"But (which applies to women who declare themselves devout) good works."</t5654>
<t5655>"Let the woman learn in silence, with complete submission —at this point, he gives us a look—.</t5655> <t5656>Complete —he repeats.</t5656>
<t5657>"I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet."</t5657>
<t5658>"For Adam was formed first, then Eve."</t5658>
<t5659>»And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, being deceived, committed a transgression.</t5659>
<t5660>»Nevertheless, she will be saved through childbearing if she continues in faith and love and holiness with sobriety.</t5660>
<t5661>To be saved through childbirth, I think.</t5661> <t5662>And what saved us before?</t5662>
<t5663>—You should tell that to the Wives —murmurs Deglen—, when they indulge in drinking —she refers to the paragraph about sobriety.</t5663> <t5664>Now we can speak again, the Commander has concluded the main ritual and they put on the rings and lift the veils.</t5664> <t5665>Tongo, I say mentally.</t5665> <t5666>Pay close attention, because now it is too late.</t5666> <t5667>The Angels will have rights to the Handmaids, later on, especially if their new Wives cannot reproduce.</t5667> <t5668>But you, girls, have been swindled.</t5668> <t5669>What you get is what you see, with all its consequences.</t5669> <t5670>But no one expects you to love it.</t5670> <t5671>You will discover it very soon.</t5671> <t5672>Simply fulfill your duty in silence.</t5672> <t5673>When you doubt, when you lie on your backs, you can look at the ceiling.</t5673>
<t5674>Who knows what you will see up there.</t5674> <t5675>Funeral wreaths and angels, constellations of dust, stellar or otherwise, the puzzles left by spiders.</t5675> <t5676>An unsettled mind always has something to occupy itself with.</t5676>
<t5677>Is something wrong, dear?, an old joke used to say.</t5677>
<t5678>No, why?</t5678>
<t5679>You have moved.</t5679>
<t5680>Don't move.</t5680>
<t5681>What we aim to achieve, says Aunt Lydia, is a spirit of camaraderie among women.</t5681> <t5682>We must all act in unison.</t5682>
<t5683>Camaraderie, bullshit, says Moira through the toilet hole.</t5683> <t5684>Aunt Lydia can go to hell, as they used to say.</t5684> <t5685>What do you bet she gets Janine to kneel?</t5685> <t5686>What do you think they're plotting in her office?</t5686> <t5687>I bet she makes her work on that dried-up, hairy, old and withered thing...</t5687>
<t5688>Moira!, he exclaimed.</t5688>
<t5689>"Moira, what?" she whispers.</t5689> <t5690>"You know you've thought about it too."</t5690>
<t5691>It is not good to talk that way, I asserted, though I felt the urge to laugh.</t5691> <t5692>But back then, I imagined that we had to try to preserve something akin to dignity.</t5692>
<t5693>"You were always such a prude," says Moira in an affected tone.</t5693> <t5694>"Of course it's good."</t5694>
<t5695>It is.</t5695>
<t5696>And he is right, I know it now, while I am kneeling on this irredeemably hard ground, listening to the hum of the ceremony.</t5696> <t5697>There is something compelling about whispering obscenities about those in power.</t5697>
<t5698>There is something delicious, something daring, stealthy, forbidden, exciting.</t5698> <t5699>It's like a curse, in a way.</t5699> <t5700>It lowers them, reduces them to the common denominator in which they can be framed.</t5700> <t5701>On the paint of the toilet, someone unknown had scribbled: Aunt Lydia sucks.</t5701> <t5702>It was like a flag waved from a hill during a rebellion.</t5702> <t5703>The mere idea that Aunt Lydia would do such a thing was encouraging.</t5703>
<t5704>So now, between these Angels and their white, desiccated wives, I imagine transcendental grunts and sweats, wet and hairy encounters; or, better yet, ignominious failures, cocks resembling overripe carrots, anguished groping of flesh, cold and unfeeling like raw fish.</t5704>
<t5705>When the ceremony finally concludes and we leave, Deglen says to me in a faint but piercing whisper:</t5705>
<t5706>—We know you see him alone.</t5706>
<t5707>—To whom? —I ask her, resisting the urge to look at her.</t5707> <t5708>I know who she is referring to.</t5708>
<t5709>—To your Commander —he clarifies—.</t5709> <t5710>We know you've been seeing him —I ask how—.</t5710> <t5711>We simply know —he responds—.</t5711> <t5712>What is he looking for? Sexual perversions?</t5712>
<t5713>It would be difficult to explain to him what he wants, because I still don't know how to name it.</t5713>
<t5714>How to describe to her what really happens between us?</t5714> <t5715>First of all, she would laugh.</t5715> <t5716>It's easier for me to say:</t5716>
<t5717>—In a certain way —this response has, at least, the dignity of coercion.</t5717>
<t5718>She reflects.</t5718>
<t5719>—You'd be surprised —he comments— to know how many do it.</t5719>
<t5720>—I can't help it —I justify myself—.</t5720> <t5721>I can't tell her that I won't go —she should know that.</t5721>
<t5722>We are already on the sidewalk and it is not convenient to talk, we are very close to the rest and we no longer have the protection of the crowd's murmur.</t5722> <t5723>We walk in silence, lagging behind, until she thinks it is prudent to say:</t5723>
<t5724>—Of course you can't.</t5724> <t5725>But find out and tell us.</t5725>
<t5726>—Find out what? —I asked, puzzled.</t5726>
<t5727>I almost seem to perceive the slight movement of his head.</t5727>
<t5728>—Everything you can.</t5728>
<t5729>CHAPTER 35</t5729>
<t5730>Now, in the warm atmosphere of my room, I have a space to fill, and also a time; a space-time, between the here and now, the there and later, interrupted by dinner.</t5730> <t5731>The arrival of the tray, carried up the stairs as if I were an invalid.</t5731> <t5732>An invalid, someone who has been invalidated.</t5732> <t5733>Without a valid passport.</t5733>
<t5734>No way out.</t5734>
<t5735>That was what happened the day we tried to cross the border, with our brand-new passports that showed we were not who we were: that Luke, for example, had never been divorced, and therefore it was legal, according to the new law.</t5735>
<t5736>After we explained to him that we were going on a picnic and after he took a look inside the car and saw our daughter asleep, surrounded by her zoo of dirty animals, the man went inside with our passports; Luke patted my arm and got out of the car pretending to stretch his legs, and watched the man through the window of the immigration building.</t5736> <t5737>I stayed in the car.</t5737> <t5738>I lit a cigarette to calm myself and inhaled the smoke, a long puff of false relaxation.</t5738> <t5739>I busied myself watching the soldiers dressed in those unfamiliar uniforms that, by then, were starting to become familiar; they were idly standing next to the yellow and black striped barrier, which was raised.</t5739> <t5740>They weren't doing much.</t5740> <t5741>One of them was watching a flock of birds that took flight, swirled, and perched on the railing of the bridge, on the other side.</t5741> <t5742>I watched him, and at the same time, them.</t5742> <t5743>Everything had the same color as always, only brighter.</t5743>
<t5744>Everything will be fine, I told myself, praying mentally.</t5744> <t5745>Oh, allow it.</t5745> <t5746>Allow us to cross, allow us to cross.</t5746> <t5747>Just this once, and then I'll do anything.</t5747> <t5748>It wouldn't make any sense, and not even be of interest, to know what I thought I could do for whoever was listening to me.</t5748>
<t5749>Then Luke got back into the car very quickly, put the key in the ignition, and backed up.</t5749> <t5750>He was going to make a phone call, he said.</t5750> <t5751>And he started driving in a hurry, then a dirt road, the forest, and we jumped out of the car and started running.</t5751> <t5752>A house to hide in, a boat, I don't know what we were thinking.</t5752> <t5753>He said the passports were safe, and we had very little time to plan it.</t5753> <t5754>Maybe he had a plan, some kind of mental map.</t5754> <t5755>As for me, I just kept running and running.</t5755>
<t5756>I don't want to tell this story.</t5756>
<t5757>I don't have to tell it.</t5757> <t5758>I don't have to tell anything, neither to myself nor to anyone else.</t5758>
<t5759>I could simply sit here, in peace.</t5759> <t5760>I could step aside.</t5760> <t5761>It is possible to go very far, inward, downward, and backward, they might never find you.</t5761>
<t5762>Don't let the bastards grind you down.</t5762> <t5763>Boy, did he mess it up.</t5763>
<t5764>Why fight?</t5764>
<t5765>It will never work.</t5765>
<t5766>"Love?" said the Commander.</t5766>
<t5767>That's better.</t5767> <t5768>It's something I know.</t5768> <t5769>We can talk about it.</t5769>
<t5770>Falling in love, I repeated.</t5770> <t5771>Falling into the clutches of love, it happened to all of us, in one way or another.</t5771> <t5772>How could he have turned it into something so empty?</t5772> <t5773>Even sarcastic.</t5773> <t5774>As if for us it were something trivial, a pose, a whim.</t5774>
<t5775>On the contrary, it was a difficult path.</t5775> <t5776>It was the central problem, the way to understand oneself; if it never happened to you, ever, you could end up like a mutant, a creature from another galaxy.</t5776> <t5777>Anyone knew it.</t5777>
<t5778>To fall into the clutches of love, we said; I fell into his arms.</t5778> <t5779>We were fallen women.</t5779> <t5780>We believed in it, in this downward movement: as beautiful as flying, and yet, at the same time, so terrible, so extreme, so improbable.</t5780> <t5781>God is love, they once said, but we turned the phrase upside down and love, like Heaven, was always just around the corner.</t5781> <t5782>The more we believed in abstract and total Love, the harder it was for us to love the man beside us.</t5782> <t5783>We were always waiting for an incarnation.</t5783> <t5784>That word, made flesh.</t5784>
<t5785>And sometimes it happened, for once.</t5785> <t5786>That kind of love comes and goes and then it's hard to remember, like pain.</t5786> <t5787>One day you looked at that man and thought</t5787> <t5788>I loved you, and you thought it in the past tense, and you felt amazed because having done so was foolish, something surprising and precarious; and you also understood why at that moment your friends had been evasive.</t5788>
<t5789>Now, when I remember this, I feel great comfort.</t5789>
<t5790>Or sometimes, even when you were still in love, you would wake up in the middle of the night, when the moon came through the window and illuminated their sleeping face, darkening the shadows of their eye sockets and making them more cavernous than during the day, and you would think: Who knows what they do when they're alone, or with other men?</t5790> <t5791>Who knows what they say, or where they go?</t5791> <t5792>Who can tell what they really are?</t5792> <t5793>In everyday life.</t5793>
<t5794>Probably, at those moments you would think: What if they don't love me?</t5794>
<t5795>Or you would remember stories you had read in the newspapers about women who had appeared —often they were women, but sometimes also men, or children, which is terrible— in ditches, or in forests, or in refrigerators of rented and abandoned rooms, with their clothes on or not, sexually abused or not; but in any case, murdered.</t5795> <t5796>There were places you didn't want to walk through, precautions you took that had to do with the locks on windows and doors, with drawing the curtains and leaving the lights on.</t5796> <t5797>These things you did were like prayers; you did them and hoped they would save you.</t5797> <t5798>And for the most part, they did.</t5798> <t5799>Or</t5799>
<t5800>something was doing it; you could tell by the fact that you were still alive.</t5800>
<t5801>But all that was only relevant at night and had nothing to do with the man you loved, at least in the light of day.</t5801> <t5802>With that man, you wanted to work, to make things function so you wouldn't get out of practice.</t5802> <t5803>And the training was something you did to keep your body in shape for that man.</t5803> <t5804>If you trained enough, maybe the man did too.</t5804> <t5805>Maybe you were capable of training together, as if both of you were a puzzle that could be solved; otherwise, one of you—most likely the man—would walk away, taking his addicted body with him and leaving you with an abandonment anguish that you could counteract through exercise.</t5805> <t5806>If things didn't work out, it was because one of you adopted an incorrect attitude.</t5806> <t5807>It was thought that everything that happened in your lives was due to some positive or negative force emanating from within your minds.</t5807>
<t5808>If you don't like it, change it, we would say to each other and to ourselves.</t5808> <t5809>And so, we would swap that man for another.</t5809> <t5810>We were sure that the change was always for the better.</t5810> <t5811>We were revisionists; we would examine ourselves.</t5811>
<t5812>It seems strange to remember what we used to think, as if we had everything within reach, as if there were no contingencies, no limits; as if we were free to eternally shape and reshape the ever-expandable perimeters of our lives.</t5812> <t5813>I was like that too, I did it too.</t5813> <t5814>Luke was not the first man in my life, and he might not have been the last.</t5814> <t5815>If he hadn't been frozen in that way.</t5815> <t5816>Stopped dead in time, in the air, among the trees, in the middle of the fall.</t5816>
<t5817>In the past, they would send you a small package with their belongings: what they had with them at the moment of death.</t5817> <t5818>According to my mother, that's what they did in times of war.</t5818> <t5819>How long were you supposed to mourn, what did they say?</t5819> <t5820>Make your life a tribute to the beloved.</t5820> <t5821>And it was, the beloved.</t5821> <t5822>Him.</t5822>
<t5823>It is, I tell myself.</t5823> <t5824>It is, it is, only two letters, stupid, are you not capable of remembering a word as short as that?</t5824>
<t5825>I dry my face with my sleeve.</t5825> <t5826>Before, I wouldn't have done it for fear of staining myself, but now it's impossible for that to happen.</t5826> <t5827>Any expression that exists, invisible to me, is real.</t5827>
<t5828>You will have to forgive me.</t5828> <t5829>I am a refugee from the past and, like other refugees, I follow the customs and habits that I abandoned or was forced to abandon, and all this seems very quaint, and I am very obsessive about it.</t5829> <t5830>Like a White Russian having tea in Paris, isolated in the twentieth century, I retreat trying to recover those distant paths; I become too sentimental, I get lost.</t5830>
<t5831>I lament.</t5831> <t5832>Lamenting is what it is, it's not crying.</t5832> <t5833>I sit in this chair and ooze, like a sponge.</t5833>
<t5834>Then.</t5834> <t5835>More waiting.</t5835> <t5836>The sweet wait: that's what they used to call the stores where you could buy maternity clothes.</t5836> <t5837>Plain waiting seems more appropriate for someone at a train station.</t5837> <t5838>Waiting is also a place: it's where you wait.</t5838>
<t5839>For me, it is this room.</t5839> <t5840>I am a space between parentheses.</t5840> <t5841>Among other people.</t5841>
<t5842>They knock on my door.</t5842> <t5843>It's Cora, with the tray.</t5843>
<t5844>But it is not Cora.</t5844>
<t5845>—I have brought you this —says Serena Joy.</t5845>
<t5846>Then I look up, look around, get up from my chair, and walk towards her.</t5846> <t5847>She holds it in her hands, it's a copy of a Polaroid, square and shiny.</t5847> <t5848>So they still make those cameras.</t5848> <t5849>And there will also be family albums, full of children; however, not a single Handmaid.</t5849> <t5850>From the perspective of future history, we will be invisible.</t5850> <t5851>But the children will exist, they will be something for the Wives to look at downstairs while they wait for the birth, nibbling at the bar.</t5851>
<t5852>—You can only have her for five minutes —Serena Joy tells me in a low, conspiratorial tone. I have to return her before they notice she's gone.</t5852>
<t5853>It must have been a Martha who got it for her.</t5853> <t5854>They form a network from which they obtain something.</t5854> <t5855>It's good to know.</t5855>
<t5856>I take her by the hands and turn her around to see her right side.</t5856> <t5857>It's her, is this what she looks like?</t5857> <t5858>My treasure.</t5858>
<t5859>So tall and changed.</t5859> <t5860>Smiling a little, in her white dress, as if she were dressed for her first communion, like in the old days.</t5860>
<t5861>Time has not stood still.</t5861> <t5862>It has soaked me, eroded me, as if I were nothing more than a woman of sand abandoned by a careless child near the water.</t5862> <t5863>For her, I have been erased.</t5863> <t5864>Now I am only a distant shadow in time, behind the smooth and shiny surface of this photograph.</t5864> <t5865>The shadow of a shadow, which is what dead mothers end up being.</t5865> <t5866>It can be seen in her eyes: I am not there.</t5866>
<t5867>But she exists, with her white dress.</t5867> <t5868>She grows and lives.</t5868> <t5869>Isn't that something good? Isn't it a blessing?</t5869>
<t5870>However, I cannot bear having been erased in that manner.</t5870> <t5871>It would have been better if he had not brought me anything.</t5871>
<t5872>I sit at the small table to eat flakes with cream with a fork.</t5872> <t5873>They give me a fork and spoon, but never a knife.</t5873> <t5874>When there is meat, they cut it in advance, as if I didn't know how to use my hands, or didn't have teeth.</t5874> <t5875>But I lack neither of those things.</t5875> <t5876>That's why they don't allow me to use a knife.</t5876>
<t5877>CHAPTER 36</t5877>
<t5878>I knock on his door, hear his voice, fix my face, and enter.</t5878> <t5879>He is standing by the fireplace; in his hand, he has an almost empty glass.</t5879> <t5880>He usually waits for me to arrive before starting to drink alcohol, although I know they drink wine with dinner.</t5880> <t5881>His face is slightly flushed.</t5881> <t5882>I try to calculate how much he has drunk.</t5882>
<t5883>—Welcome —she greets me—.</t5883> <t5884>How is the little one tonight?</t5884>
<t5885>From the elaborate smile she gives me, I estimate not much.</t5885> <t5886>She is in the courtesy phase.</t5886>
<t5887>—I'm fine —I reply.</t5887>
<t5888>—Ready for a little excitement?</t5888>
<t5889>—How? —I ask him.</t5889> <t5890>Behind his words, I sense a discomfort, an uncertainty about how far he can go with me, and in what direction.</t5890>
<t5891>—Tonight I have a little surprise for you —he announces and bursts into laughter.</t5891> <t5892>It's more of a giggle.</t5892> <t5893>I notice that tonight everything is small.</t5893> <t5894>He wants to diminish things, even me—.</t5894> <t5895>Something you will like.</t5895>
<t5896>—What is it? —I ask—.</t5896> <t5897>Chinese paintings? —I can take these liberties; he seems to enjoy them, especially after a couple of drinks.</t5897> <t5898>He prefers me to be frivolous.</t5898>
<t5899>—Something better —he specifies, trying to seem seductive.</t5899>
<t5900>—I'm impatient.</t5900>
<t5901>—Alright —he says.</t5901> <t5902>He goes to his desk and rummages through a drawer.</t5902> <t5903>Then he approaches me, with one hand behind his back.</t5903>
<t5904>—Guess —he suggests.</t5904>
<t5905>—Animal, vegetable, or mineral? —I ask.</t5905>
<t5906>—Oh, animal —he states with mocking seriousness—.</t5906> <t5907>Definitely an animal, I would say</t5907>
<t5908>—he moves his hand away from behind his back.</t5908> <t5909>He is holding something resembling a handful of mauve and pink feathers.</t5909> <t5910>He spreads them out.</t5910> <t5911>It appears to be a garment, and a woman's at that: you can see the two cups for the breasts, covered in purple sequins.</t5911>
<t5912>Sequins are tiny stars.</t5912> <t5913>The feathers are placed around the leg hole and along the top part.</t5913> <t5914>So, after all, I wasn't wrong about the sash.</t5914>
<t5915>I wonder where she found it.</t5915> <t5916>It is supposed that all clothes of that type have been destroyed.</t5916> <t5917>I remember seeing it on television, in clips filmed in various cities.</t5917> <t5918>In New York, it was called the Manhattan Cleanup.</t5918> <t5919>In Times Square, there were bonfires and crowds singing around them, women raising their arms, grateful, every time they felt the cameras focusing on them, young men with stony and clean-shaven faces throwing objects into the flames: silk garments, nylon and imitation leather, green, red, and violet garters, black satin, golden lamé, shiny silver; bikini panties, transparent bras with pink satin hearts sewn to cover the nipples.</t5919> <t5920>And the manufacturers, importers, and sellers kneeling, repenting in public, with their heads covered with paper hats, conical in shape —like donkey ears—</t5920>
<t5921>with the word SHAME painted in red.</t5921>
<t5922>But some things must have been saved from the flames; most likely, they didn't find them all.</t5922> <t5923>He must have gotten it the same way he got the magazines: dishonestly; it reeks of the black market.</t5923> <t5924>And it's not new, it has been used before; under the arms, the garment is wrinkled and slightly stained with the sweat of some other woman.</t5924>
<t5925>—I had to guess the size —he warns me—.</t5925> <t5926>I hope it fits you well.</t5926>
<t5927>—Do you expect me to wear this? —I am astonished.</t5927> <t5928>I know my voice sounds prudish and disapproving.</t5928> <t5929>However, there is something appealing about the idea.</t5929> <t5930>I have never worn anything even remotely similar, so bright and theatrical, and that must be what it is, an old theater costume, or something from a long-gone nightclub act; the closest thing I ever wore were swimsuits and a peach-colored lace bustier set that Luke bought me once.</t5930> <t5931>However, there is something seductive about this garment, it holds the childish allure of dressing up.</t5931> <t5932>And it would be so ostentatious, like mocking the Aunts, so sinful, so free...</t5932> <t5933>Freedom, like everything else, is relative.</t5933>
<t5934>—Alright —I accept, trying not to seem too eager.</t5934> <t5935>I want him to feel like I'm doing him a favor.</t5935> <t5936>Maybe we've reached his true and deep desire.</t5936> <t5937>Does he have a whip hidden behind the door?</t5937> <t5938>Will he take off his boots and throw himself or throw me onto the desk?</t5938>
<t5939>—It's a disguise —he explains to me—.</t5939> <t5940>You will also have to paint your face; I brought everything you need.</t5940> <t5941>You couldn't get in without this.</t5941>
<t5942>—Where? —I ask.</t5942>
<t5943>—Tonight I am going to take you out.</t5943>
<t5944>—Outside? —it's an archaic expression.</t5944> <t5945>Surely there is no longer any place to take a woman.</t5945>
<t5946>—Get out of here —he asserts.</t5946>
<t5947>I know, without needing to be told, that what he proposes is risky for him, but especially for me; nevertheless, I want to go.</t5947> <t5948>I want anything that breaks the monotony, that subverts the respectable order of things.</t5948>
<t5949>I tell him that I don't want him to look at me while I put on the garment; in front of him, I am still ashamed of my body.</t5949> <t5950>He says he will turn his back, and he does; I take off my shoes and socks, the cotton tights, and put on the feathers under the protection of the dress.</t5950> <t5951>Then I take off the dress and slide the thin sequined straps over my shoulders.</t5951> <t5952>There is also a pair of mauve shoes with absurdly high heels.</t5952> <t5953>Nothing fits me perfectly: the shoes are a bit big and the waist of the outfit is too tight, but they will do.</t5953>
<t5954>—It's done —I announce, and he turns around.</t5954> <t5955>I feel stupid; I want to see myself in a mirror.</t5955>
<t5956>—Charming —he comments—.</t5956> <t5957>And now your face.</t5957>
<t5958>All she has is an old, soft lipstick with an artificial grape scent, an eyeliner, and makeup.</t5958> <t5959>No eyeshadow, no blush.</t5959> <t5960>For a moment, I think I won't remember how to do it, and my first attempt with the eyeliner leaves one eyelid stained black, as if I had done it in a fight; but I clean it off with the vegetable oil hand lotion and try again.</t5960> <t5961>I lightly rub my cheekbones with the lipstick and blend it out.</t5961> <t5962>While I perform the operation, he holds a huge silver-backed hand mirror for me.</t5962> <t5963>I recognize Serena Joy's mirror.</t5963> <t5964>He must have taken it from her room.</t5964>
<t5965>I can't do anything with my hair.</t5965>
<t5966>—Great —he states.</t5966> <t5967>At this point, he is quite excited; it's as if we were getting dressed to go to a party.</t5967>
<t5968>Go to the closet and take out a cloak with a hood.</t5968> <t5969>It is light blue, the color of the Wives.</t5969> <t5970>It must also belong to Serena.</t5970>
<t5971>—Put the hood over your face —he instructs—.</t5971> <t5972>Try not to mess up the makeup.</t5972>
<t5973>It is to go through the controls.</t5973>
<t5974>—And my pass? —I ask.</t5974>
<t5975>—Don't worry about that —he reassures me—.</t5975> <t5976>I've got one for you.</t5976>
<t5977>And we are getting ready to leave.</t5977>
<t5978>We slid together through the streets shrouded in shadows.</t5978> <t5979>The Commander has taken my right hand, like teenagers in the movies.</t5979> <t5980>I close my light blue cloak tightly, as a good Wife would do.</t5980> <t5981>Through the tunnel formed by the hood, I can see the back of Nick's neck.</t5981> <t5982>He wears his cap in the correct position, sits upright with his neck stretched, his whole body is erect.</t5982> <t5983>Does his posture disapprove of my behavior, or am I imagining it?</t5983> <t5984>Does he know what I'm wearing under the cloak, did he get it himself?</t5984> <t5985>If so, is he angry, does he feel any desire, envy, or something else?</t5985> <t5986>We have one thing in common: we both must be invisible, we are both officials.</t5986> <t5987>I wonder if he knows that.</t5987> <t5988>When he opened the car door for the Commander, and by extension for me, I tried to catch his eye, make him look at me, but he acted as if he didn't see me.</t5988> <t5989>Why not?</t5989> <t5990>For him, it's an easy job: small errands, favors, and I don't think he wants to risk his situation.</t5990>
<t5991>At the checkpoints, no problems arise; everything goes as smoothly as the Commander said, despite the heavy pounding and the pressure of the blood in my head.</t5991>
<t5992>Shitty chicken, Moira would say.</t5992>
<t5993>When we passed the second checkpoint, Nick asks:</t5993>
<t5994>—Here, sir?</t5994>
<t5995>—Yes —replies the Commander.</t5995> <t5996>The car moves forward and the Commander warns me</t5996>
<t5997>—: Now I will have to ask you to settle down on the floor of the car.</t5997>
<t5998>—On the ground? —I am astonished.</t5998>
<t5999>—We have to go through the door —he explains to me, as if that meant something to me.</t5999> <t6000>I tried to ask him where we were going, but he said he wanted to surprise me.</t6000>
<t6001>—.</t6001> <t6002>Wives are not allowed to enter.</t6002>
<t6003>So I press myself against the ground and the car starts again, and for a few minutes I see nothing.</t6003> <t6004>Under the coat, it's unbearably hot.</t6004> <t6005>It's a winter coat, not made of cotton like the summer ones, and it smells of mothballs.</t6005> <t6006>He must have taken it from the winter clothes closet, knowing she wouldn't notice.</t6006> <t6007>He was kind enough to move his feet to make room for me.</t6007> <t6008>Even so, my forehead is against his shoes.</t6008> <t6009>I've never been so close to his shoes before.</t6009> <t6010>They seem hard, impenetrable like the shell of cockroaches: black, polished, unyielding.</t6010>
<t6011>It's as if they had nothing to do with the feet.</t6011>
<t6012>We passed through another checkpoint.</t6012> <t6013>I hear the impersonal and respectful voices, and the window that goes down and up electrically so that he can present the passes.</t6013> <t6014>This time he doesn't show mine, the one that is supposed to be mine, because officially I don't exist, for now.</t6014>
<t6015>Then the car starts and stops again, and the commander helps me to get up.</t6015>
<t6016>—We will have to be quick —he comments—.</t6016> <t6017>This is a back entrance.</t6017> <t6018>You will leave the cloak with Nick.</t6018> <t6019>At the usual time —he says to Nick.</t6019> <t6020>So this is also something he has done before.</t6020>
<t6021>He helps me take off my coat; the car door is open.</t6021> <t6022>I feel the air on my almost bare skin and realize that I have been sweating.</t6022> <t6023>When I turn to close the car door, I see Nick looking at me through the glass.</t6023> <t6024>Now he sees me.</t6024>
<t6025>What I see is disdain, or indifference, is it simply what he expected from me?</t6025>
<t6026>We are in an alley, behind a fairly modern red brick building.</t6026>
<t6027>Next to the door, there is a row of garbage bins that smell like decomposing fried chicken.</t6027> <t6028>The Commander inserts the key into the door, which is flat and gray and level with the wall and, it seems to me, is made of steel.</t6028> <t6029>Inside, there is a concrete hallway illuminated with fluorescent lamps; a sort of functional tunnel.</t6029>
<t6030>—It's here —the Commander tells me.</t6030> <t6031>He places a purple tag with an elastic band on my wrist, like the tags they give at airports for luggage—.</t6031> <t6032>If anyone asks, say you are rented for tonight —</t6032>
<t6033>advises me.</t6033> <t6034>Takes me by the arm to guide me.</t6034> <t6035>What I want is a mirror to see if my lips are well painted or if the feathers are too ridiculous and very disordered.</t6035> <t6036>With this light, I must look very pale.</t6036> <t6037>But it is already too late.</t6037>
<t6038>Idiot, says Moira.</t6038>
<t6039>CHAPTER 37</t6039>
<t6040>We walked down the hallway, went through another flat, gray door, and proceeded down another hallway, this time illuminated and covered with a mushroom-colored, dusky pink carpet.</t6040> <t6041>The doors open outward and are numbered: one hundred one, one hundred two, like one counts during a storm to know how far away it is.</t6041> <t6042>So, it's a hotel.</t6042> <t6043>From behind one of the doors, laughter can be heard, that of a man and a woman.</t6043> <t6044>It had been a long time since I heard laughter.</t6044>
<t6045>We stepped out into a central courtyard.</t6045> <t6046>It is spacious and tall, with several floors leading up to the skylight at the top.</t6046> <t6047>In the center, there is a fountain, a round fountain that sprays water in the shape of a dandelion that is beginning to seed.</t6047> <t6048>Plants in pots and tree saplings here and there, vines hanging from the balconies.</t6048> <t6049>Elevators with oval glass panels glide up and down like giant mollusks.</t6049>
<t6050>I know where I am.</t6050> <t6051>I've been here before: with Luke, in the afternoons, a long time ago.</t6051> <t6052>It used to be a hotel.</t6052> <t6053>Now it's full of women.</t6053>
<t6054>I stay still and watch them.</t6054> <t6055>Here I can stare, look around, I no longer have the wimple that prevents me from doing so.</t6055> <t6056>My head, stripped of it, feels strangely light, as if a weight or part of its substance has been removed.</t6056>
<t6057>The women are sitting, lounging, walking around, or leaning against each other.</t6057> <t6058>Mixed with them are some men, heaps of men who, dressed in their uniforms or dark suits, so similar to each other, form an undifferentiated background.</t6058> <t6059>The women, for their part, have a tropical look, dressed in all kinds of festive and bright clothes.</t6059> <t6060>Some of them wear outfits like mine, with feathers and shiny decorations, low-cut at the thighs and breasts.</t6060> <t6061>Some are wearing underwear like what used to be worn before, short nightgowns, short pajamas, and the occasional transparent negligee.</t6061> <t6062>Others are wearing swimsuits, either one-piece or bikinis; there's one with a garment made of crochet and huge scallop shells covering her breasts.</t6062> <t6063>Some are dressed in sports shorts and open-back blouses, others in gym leotards like those seen on TV, tight, and pastel-colored knitted leg warmers.</t6063> <t6064>You can even see some in cheerleader outfits, short pleated skirts, and huge letters on their chests.</t6064> <t6065>I imagine they had to resort to this mix, to whatever they could swipe or salvage.</t6065> <t6066>They are all made up, and I realize how strange it is for me to see women with makeup, because their eyes seem too big, too dark and shiny, their mouths too red, too wet, as if bathed in blood; or, on the other hand, clownish.</t6066>
<t6067>At first glance, there is a certain joy in the scene.</t6067> <t6068>It's like a costume dance; they are like children too grown-up for their age, dressed in outfits they found rummaging through a trunk.</t6068> <t6069>Is there something pleasurable in all this?</t6069> <t6070>It could be, but did they choose it?</t6070> <t6071>It cannot be deduced at first sight.</t6071>
<t6072>In this room, there is a large number of butts.</t6072> <t6073>I'm not used to them anymore.</t6073>
<t6074>—It's like traveling to the past —comments the Commander in a satisfied, even delighted tone— Don't you think?</t6074>
<t6075>I try to remember if the past was exactly like this.</t6075> <t6076>Now I'm not sure.</t6076> <t6077>I know it contained these things, but somehow the mix is different.</t6077> <t6078>A movie about the past is not the same as the past.</t6078>
<t6079>—Yes —I affirm.</t6079> <t6080>What I feel is not a simple thing.</t6080> <t6081>Certainly, these women do not scare me, they do not impress me.</t6081> <t6082>I recognize in them the type of idle woman.</t6082>
<t6083>The official creed rejects them, denies their very existence, and yet, here they are.</t6083> <t6084>At least that is something.</t6084>
<t6085>—Don't just stand there staring stupidly —the Commander advises me, or you'll give yourself away.</t6085> <t6086>Act naturally</t6086>
<t6087>—guide me again.</t6087> <t6088>A man has recognized him, greeted him, and started walking towards us.</t6088> <t6089>The Commander grabs my arm more firmly.</t6089>
<t6090>—. Calm down —he whispers—.</t6090> <t6091>Don't lose your composure.</t6091>
<t6092>All you have to do, I tell myself, is keep your mouth shut and look stupid.</t6092> <t6093>It's not that hard.</t6093>
<t6094>The Commander speaks for me, with this man and with the others who come with him.</t6094> <t6095>He doesn't say much about me, he doesn't need to.</t6095> <t6096>He explains that I am new and they look at me, dismiss me, and proceed to talk about other things.</t6096> <t6097>My disguise has fulfilled its function.</t6097>
<t6098>He keeps holding my arm and, as he speaks, his spine becomes imperceptibly rigid, his chest expands, his voice adopts more and more the vivacity and jocularity of youth.</t6098> <t6099>It occurs to me that he is showing off.</t6099> <t6100>He is showing me off to them, and they understand and are decorous enough, keeping their hands still but observing my breasts and legs as if there were no reason not to.</t6100> <t6101>But he is also showing off to me.</t6101> <t6102>He is demonstrating his mastery of the world to me.</t6102> <t6103>He is breaking the rules right under their noses, mocking them.</t6103> <t6104>Perhaps he has reached that state of intoxication that, it is said, power inspires, that state that makes some feel indispensable and believe they can do anything, absolutely anything they please.</t6104> <t6105>For the second time, when he thinks no one is looking, he winks at me.</t6105>
<t6106>All this is childish ostentation, and a pathetic situation; but it is something I understand.</t6106>
<t6107>When she gets tired of the conversation, she takes me by the arm again, this time to a soft, flowered sofa, like the ones that used to be in hotel lobbies; in fact, in this lobby, there is a floral pattern that I still remember, a dark blue background with pink art nouveau style flowers.</t6107>
<t6108>—I thought that with those shoes —he explains— maybe your feet were tired —he's right, and I feel grateful.</t6108> <t6109>He helps me sit down, and sits next to me.</t6109> <t6110>He puts an arm around my shoulders.</t6110> <t6111>The fabric of his sleeve feels rough against my skin, I'm so unaccustomed to being touched—.</t6111> <t6112>Well? —he continues—.</t6112> <t6113>What do you think of our little club?</t6113>
<t6114>I look around me again.</t6114> <t6115>The men do not form a homogeneous mass, as it seemed to me at first.</t6115> <t6116>Next to the fountain, there is a group of Japanese people dressed in light gray suits, and in a corner, a white spot: Arabs clad in their long tunics, their headdresses, and striped sandals.</t6116>
<t6117>—Is it a club? —I ask.</t6117>
<t6118>—Well, that's what we call it, among ourselves.</t6118> <t6119>The club.</t6119>
<t6120>—I thought this kind of thing was forbidden —I commented.</t6120>
<t6121>—Officially, yes —he acknowledges—.</t6121> <t6122>But after all, we are all human.</t6122>
<t6123>I hope they give me more details but, since they don't, I ask them:</t6123>
<t6124>—And what does that mean?</t6124>
<t6125>—It means that it is impossible to escape Nature —he assures—.</t6125> <t6126>In the case of men, Nature demands variety.</t6126> <t6127>It is logical, it is part of the procreation strategy.</t6127> <t6128>It is Nature's plan —I do not respond, so he continues—.</t6128>
<t6129>Women know it instinctively.</t6129> <t6130>Why did they buy so many different clothes back then?</t6130> <t6131>To make men believe they were several different women.</t6131> <t6132>A new woman every day.</t6132>
<t6133>He says it as if he believes it, but he says many things in this manner.</t6133> <t6134>Maybe he believes them, maybe he doesn't, or maybe both things happen to him at the same time.</t6134> <t6135>It's impossible to know what he thinks.</t6135>
<t6136>—That's why, now that we don't have different clothes —I suggest—, you simply have different women —it's irony, but he doesn't get it.</t6136>
<t6137>—This solves a lot of problems —he says without batting an eye.</t6137>
<t6138>I do not respond to him.</t6138> <t6139>I'm starting to get fed up with him.</t6139> <t6140>I feel like being cold to him, spending the rest of the evening with a bad face and silent.</t6140> <t6141>But I can't afford that luxury, I know.</t6141> <t6142>Whatever it is, at least this is a night out.</t6142>
<t6143>What I would really like to do is chat with the women, but I understand that I have little chance of doing so.</t6143>
<t6144>—Who are these people? —I ask.</t6144>
<t6145>—This is only for officers —he clarifies to me—.</t6145> <t6146>From all branches; and for high-ranking officials.</t6146> <t6147>And commercial delegations, of course.</t6147> <t6148>It stimulates commerce.</t6148> <t6149>It's an ideal place to meet people.</t6149> <t6150>Outside of here, it's hardly possible to do business.</t6150>
<t6151>We try to provide at least the same as what they can get anywhere else.</t6151> <t6152>You can also find out things, information.</t6152> <t6153>Sometimes a man tells a woman things he would never tell another man.</t6153>
<t6154>—No —he clarified—.</t6154> <t6155>I am referring to the women.</t6155>
<t6156>—Oh —he exclaims—.</t6156> <t6157>Well, some of them are real prostitutes.</t6157> <t6158>Street girls— he laughs— from the old days.</t6158> <t6159>They couldn't be assimilated; anyway, most of them prefer this.</t6159>
<t6160>—And the others? —I ask.</t6160>
<t6161>—The others?</t6161> <t6162>Well, we have quite a collection.</t6162> <t6163>That one over there, the one in green, is a sociologist.</t6163> <t6164>Or was.</t6164> <t6165>That one was a lawyer, that one was in business, she had an executive position in some kind of takeout food chain, or maybe it was hotels.</t6165> <t6166>I've been told that if one just wants to talk, she is the ideal person to have an interesting conversation with.</t6166> <t6167>They also prefer to be here.</t6167>
<t6168>—Do you prefer this over something else? —I ask.</t6168>
<t6169>—To the alternatives —he replies—.</t6169> <t6170>Even you might prefer this to what you have</t6170>
<t6171>—he says in a timid tone, he's looking for praise, he wants me to compliment him, and I know that the serious part of the conversation has come to an end.</t6171>
<t6172>—I don't know —I say, as if analyzing the possibility—.</t6172> <t6173>It must be hard work.</t6173>
<t6174>—You should watch your weight, there's no doubt about that —he asserts—.</t6174> <t6175>They are very strict about it.</t6175> <t6176>If you gain four kilos, they send you to Solitary —is he joking?</t6176>
<t6177>It's most likely, but I don't want to know—.</t6177> <t6178>Now —he says—, to get you in the mood, how about a drink?</t6178>
<t6179>—I must not drink —I remind him—.</t6179> <t6180>He already knows.</t6180>
<t6181>—For once, it won't hurt you —he insists—.</t6181> <t6182>On the other hand, it wouldn't be normal if you didn't do it.</t6182> <t6183>In here, no taboos for nicotine and alcohol!</t6183> <t6184>You see that here they enjoy certain advantages.</t6184>
<t6185>—Alright —I accept.</t6185> <t6186>Deep down, I am delighted with the idea; it's been years since I had a drink.</t6186>
<t6187>—So what should I order? —he asks me—.</t6187> <t6188>They have everything here, and imported.</t6188>
<t6189>—A tonic with gin —I decide—.</t6189> <t6190>But light, please.</t6190> <t6191>I wouldn't want to put you in a bind.</t6191>
<t6192>—You won't do it —he says, smiling.</t6192> <t6193>He stands up and, surprisingly, grabs my hand and kisses my palm.</t6193> <t6194>Then he walks away towards the bar.</t6194> <t6195>He could have called a waitress —there are a few, all dressed in black miniskirts and tassels on their chests—, but they seem so busy that it's hard for them to respond to a signal.</t6195>
<t6196>Then I see her.</t6196> <t6197>Moira.</t6197> <t6198>She is standing with two other women, near the fountain.</t6198> <t6199>I have to look at her again carefully to make sure it is her.</t6199> <t6200>I look at her intermittently, with quick eye movements, so that no one notices.</t6200>
<t6201>She is absurdly dressed in a black outfit that was once shiny satin and is now a worn-out fabric.</t6201> <t6202>It is strapless and has a wire inside that lifts her breasts, but it doesn't fit Moira well; it is too long, causing one breast to be lifted and the other not.</t6202> <t6203>She absentmindedly tugs at the top part to lift it up.</t6203> <t6204>She has a cotton ball on her back, which I see when she turns sideways; it looks like a sanitary pad that has burst like a popcorn kernel.</t6204> <t6205>I realize she intends it to be a tail.</t6205> <t6206>She has two ears tied to her head; I can't tell if they are rabbit or deer ears; one of the ears has lost its stiffness, or the wire frame, and is half drooping.</t6206> <t6207>She wears a bow tie around her neck, black tulle stockings, and black high-heeled shoes.</t6207>
<t6208>She always hated high heels.</t6208>
<t6209>The entire outfit, old and outlandish, reminds me of something from the past, but I can't deduce what it is.</t6209> <t6210>A play, a musical comedy?</t6210> <t6211>Girls dressed for Easter, in bunny costumes.</t6211> <t6212>What does that mean in this place, why are bunnies supposed to be sexually attractive to men?</t6212> <t6213>How can such a shabby costume be attractive?</t6213>
<t6214>Moira is smoking a cigarette.</t6214> <t6215>She takes a drag and passes it to the woman on her left, who is wearing a red sequin dress with a long tail ending in a point and silver horns: a devil costume.</t6215> <t6216>Now she has her arms crossed in front of her body, beneath her breasts lifted with wire.</t6216> <t6217>She shifts her weight from one foot to the other; her feet must be hurting.</t6217> <t6218>Her spine is slightly curved.</t6218> <t6219>She scans the room with her eyes, but without interest.</t6219> <t6220>This must be a familiar scene.</t6220>
<t6221>I want her to look at me, to see me, but her gaze slides over me as if I were nothing more than another palm tree, another chair.</t6221> <t6222>Surely she will look again, I desire it with all my strength, she must look at me before any of the men approach her, before she disappears.</t6222> <t6223>The other woman who is with her, the blonde in the pink morning coat with a worn fur trim, already has an assigned companion, she has entered the glass elevator and has gone up until she disappeared from sight.</t6223> <t6224>Moira turns her head again, perhaps looking for potential clients.</t6224>
<t6225>It must be hard to stay there without anyone claiming her, as if she were at a school dance and being overlooked.</t6225> <t6226>This time her eyes fix on me.</t6226> <t6227>She sees me.</t6227>
<t6228>Knows that it is better not to react.</t6228>
<t6229>We stared at each other intently, with expressionless and apathetic faces.</t6229> <t6230>Then she makes a slight movement with her head, a slight shake to the right.</t6230> <t6231>She takes the cigarette offered by the woman in red again, brings it to her mouth, and leaves her hand suspended in the air for a moment, all five fingers stretched out.</t6231> <t6232>Then she turns her back.</t6232>
<t6233>Our old signal.</t6233> <t6234>I have five minutes to get to the women's restroom, which must be somewhere to my right.</t6234> <t6235>I look around: no sign of the restroom.</t6235> <t6236>I can't risk going up and wandering aimlessly, without the Commander.</t6236>
<t6237>I don't know enough, I'm not up to date, they could ask me questions.</t6237>
<t6238>One minute, two.</t6238> <t6239>Moira starts pacing when she sees that I don't show up.</t6239> <t6240>She can only trust that I understood her and that I will follow her.</t6240>
<t6241>The Commander returns with two glasses.</t6241> <t6242>He smiles at me, places the glasses on the long coffee table in front of the sofa, and sits down.</t6242>
<t6243>—Are you having fun? —he asks me.</t6243> <t6244>He wants me to have fun.</t6244> <t6245>After all, this is a pleasure.</t6245>
<t6246>I smile at him/her.</t6246>
<t6247>—Is there a bathroom? —I ask.</t6247>
<t6248>—Of course —he responds.</t6248> <t6249>He takes a sip from his glass.</t6249> <t6250>He doesn't provide me with any more information.</t6250>
<t6251>—I need to go —I count mentally, it's no longer minutes, but seconds.</t6251>
<t6252>—It's there —he indicates to me.</t6252>
<t6253>—And what if someone stops me?</t6253>
<t6254>—Show him your tag —he says—.</t6254> <t6255>It will be enough.</t6255> <t6256>They will know that you are reserved.</t6256>
<t6257>I get up and cross the room with unsteady steps.</t6257> <t6258>When I reach the fountain, I stagger and am about to fall.</t6258> <t6259>It's the heels.</t6259> <t6260>Without the Commander's arm to hold me, I lose my balance.</t6260> <t6261>Several men look at me, I think with astonishment rather than lust.</t6261> <t6262>I feel foolish.</t6262> <t6263>I put my left arm in front of my body, clearly visible and bent at the elbow with the tag facing outward.</t6263> <t6264>Nobody says anything.</t6264>
<t6265>CHAPTER 38</t6265>
<t6266>I find the entrance to the women's restrooms.</t6266> <t6267>On the door, the word Ladies is still written in golden letters with decorations.</t6267> <t6268>There is a hallway leading to the door and, next to it, a woman sitting in front of a table, supervising the entrances and exits.</t6268> <t6269>She is an older woman wearing a purple caftan and her eyes are painted with golden shadow, but there is no doubt about it: she is an Aunt.</t6269> <t6270>She has the stinger on the table and the strap around her wrist.</t6270> <t6271>No nonsense is tolerated here.</t6271>
<t6272>—Fifteen minutes —he informs me.</t6272> <t6273>He hands me a rectangular purple card that he takes from a pile on the table.</t6273> <t6274>It's like a fitting room in an old-fashioned store.</t6274> <t6275>I hear him say to the woman who enters behind me—: You were just here.</t6275>
<t6276>—I need to go again —the woman explains to him.</t6276>
<t6277>—Rest is once an hour —says the Aunt—.</t6277> <t6278>You already know the rules.</t6278>
<t6279>The woman begins to protest in a desperate and complaining tone.</t6279> <t6280>I push the door and open it.</t6280>
<t6281>I remember this.</t6281> <t6282>It is the resting area, softly illuminated in pink tones; there are several armchairs and a sofa with a lime green bamboo shoot pattern, and above it a wall clock with a golden filigree frame.</t6282> <t6283>Here they haven't removed the mirror, there's a very large one in front of the sofa.</t6283> <t6284>Here you need to know what you look like.</t6284> <t6285>On the other side of an archway are the toilet cubicles, also pink, and sinks and more mirrors.</t6285>
<t6286>There are several women sitting on the chairs and on the sofa; they have taken off their shoes and are smoking.</t6286> <t6287>When I enter, they watch me.</t6287> <t6288>In the air, the smell of perfume, smoke, and active bodies mix together.</t6288>
<t6289>—New? —one of them asks me.</t6289>
<t6290>—Yes —I respond while searching with my eyes for Moira, whom I don't see anywhere.</t6290>
<t6291>The women do not smile.</t6291> <t6292>They go back to focusing on their cigarettes as if it were a serious matter.</t6292> <t6293>In the room at the end, a woman dressed in a cat costume, with an orange faux fur tail, is touching up her makeup.</t6293>
<t6294>It's like being backstage: makeup and smoke, materials of illusion.</t6294>
<t6295>Hesitation, I don't know what to do.</t6295> <t6296>I don't want to ask about Moira, I don't know how safe it is.</t6296> <t6297>Then I hear the water running from one of the toilets and Moira comes out.</t6297> <t6298>She sways in my direction; I wait for some signal.</t6298>
<t6299>—Everything is fine —she tells me and the other women—.</t6299> <t6300>I know her —the others smile, and Moira hugs me.</t6300> <t6301>I wrap my arms around her and the wire that lifts her breasts digs into my chest.</t6301> <t6302>We kiss, first one cheek, then the other.</t6302> <t6303>We separate.</t6303>
<t6304>—How horrifying —he states and gives me a smile. You look like the Whore of Babylon.</t6304>
<t6305>—Isn't that what I should seem like? —I ask him.</t6305> <t6306>You look like something dragged in by a cat.</t6306>
<t6307>—Yes —he acknowledges, raising his forehead—, it's not my style, and this thing is about to fall apart.</t6307> <t6308>I wish they could find someone who still knew how to make them.</t6308> <t6309>Then I could get something halfway decent.</t6309>
<t6310>—Did you choose it? —I wonder if he preferred it over the others because it is less flashy.</t6310> <t6311>At least this one is only black and white.</t6311>
<t6312>—Damn, no —he exclaims—.</t6312> <t6313>It's one of those distributed by the government.</t6313> <t6314>I suppose they thought it was me.</t6314>
<t6315>I still can't believe it's her.</t6315> <t6316>I touch her arm again.</t6316> <t6317>I burst into tears.</t6317>
<t6318>—Don't do it —he advises me.</t6318> <t6319>The paint will run.</t6319> <t6320>Besides, there is no time.</t6320>
<t6321>Move aside —he tells them in his usual peremptory and curt manner to the two women who are sitting on the sofa; and, as usual, he gets his way.</t6321>
<t6322>—Anyway, my break is almost over —one of the women responds, dressed in a pale blue Merry Widow suit and white socks.</t6322> <t6323>She stands up and shakes my hand—</t6323> <t6324>Welcome —she says to me.</t6324>
<t6325>The other woman also gets up and Moira and I sit down.</t6325> <t6326>The first thing we do is take off our shoes.</t6326>
<t6327>—What the hell are you doing here? —he finally asks me—.</t6327> <t6328>It's not that it's not fantastic to see you, but it's not so fantastic for you.</t6328> <t6329>What mistake did you make? Did you laugh at his dick?</t6329>
<t6330>I look at the flat ceiling.</t6330>
<t6331>—Are there hidden microphones? —I ask.</t6331> <t6332>I carefully wipe my eyes with my fingers.</t6332> <t6333>The black paint comes off.</t6333>
<t6334>—Probably —admits Moira—.</t6334> <t6335>Do you want a cigarette?</t6335>
<t6336>—I would love to.</t6336>
<t6337>—You —he says to the woman next to him—.</t6337> <t6338>Leave me one, will you?</t6338>
<t6339>The woman willingly hands one over to him.</t6339> <t6340>Moira remains a skilled fencer.</t6340> <t6341>I smile upon confirming it.</t6341>
<t6342>—On the other hand, maybe not —Moira reflects—.</t6342> <t6343>Don't think they care about what we say.</t6343> <t6344>They've already heard almost everything, and anyway, no one leaves here unless it's in a black van.</t6344> <t6345>But if you're here, you must already know that.</t6345>
<t6346>I approach her to be able to whisper in her ear.</t6346>
<t6347>—I am here temporarily —I explain to him—.</t6347> <t6348>Only for tonight.</t6348> <t6349>I shouldn't be here, in any way.</t6349> <t6350>He smuggled me in.</t6350>
<t6351>—Who? —he asks me, also in a whisper—.</t6351> <t6352>That piece of shit who accompanies you?</t6352> <t6353>I was also with him, it's hellish.</t6353>
<t6354>—He is my Commander —I clarify.</t6354>
<t6355>Nods with the head.</t6355>
<t6356>—Some of them do it, it gives them pleasure.</t6356> <t6357>It's like screwing on the altar, or something like that.</t6357> <t6358>The ones in your gang must be chaste vessels.</t6358> <t6359>They love to see you all made up.</t6359>
<t6360>It is nothing more than another regrettable slip of power.</t6360>
<t6361>It had never occurred to me, this interpretation.</t6361> <t6362>I apply it to the Commander, but it seems too simple for him, too crude.</t6362> <t6363>Surely his motivations are more delicate.</t6363> <t6364>Although it may just be vanity that drives me to think this way.</t6364>
<t6365>—We don't have much time left —I warn him—.</t6365> <t6366>Tell me everything.</t6366>
<t6367>Moira shrugs.</t6367>
<t6368>—What interest does it have? —he comments.</t6368> <t6369>But he knows it is interesting, so he begins his story.</t6369>
<t6370>This is what it says, what it whispers, more or less.</t6370> <t6371>I can't remember the exact words, because I had nothing to write it down with.</t6371> <t6372>I have completed the story for her as much as possible: we didn't have much time, so she only gave me a summary.</t6372>
<t6373>She told me in two sessions, we managed to take a second break together.</t6373> <t6374>I have tried to use her same style.</t6374> <t6375>It is a way to keep her alive.</t6375>
<t6376>—I left that old witch Aunt Elizabeth tied up like a Christmas turkey behind the stove.</t6376> <t6377>I wanted to kill her, I really did, but now I'm glad I didn't, or things would have been much worse for me.</t6377> <t6378>I couldn't believe how easy it was to get out of the Center.</t6378> <t6379>Dressed in that brown suit, I just walked with a determined step.</t6379> <t6380>I kept walking as if I knew where I was going until I was out of sight.</t6380>
<t6381>I had no plan; it wasn't something organized, as they believed, although when they tried to get information out of me, I made up a bunch of things.</t6381> <t6382>It's what anyone does when they put the electrodes on you, and other things.</t6382> <t6383>You don't care what you say.</t6383>
<t6384>I continued with my shoulders back and my chin high, moving forward and trying to think about what I would do.</t6384> <t6385>When they destroyed the printing press, they captured many women I knew, and I thought they would have captured the rest by now.</t6385> <t6386>I was sure they had a list.</t6386> <t6387>We were foolish enough to think we could continue as before, even in hiding, and we moved everything we had in the office to our basements and back rooms.</t6387> <t6388>So I knew it was not wise to approach any of those houses.</t6388>
<t6389>»I had a vague idea of the part of the city I was in, although I didn't remember ever seeing the street I was walking on.</t6389> <t6390>But by the sun, I could estimate where north was.</t6390> <t6391>After all, having been a Girl Scout had some usefulness.</t6391> <t6392>I thought it would be best to follow that direction and see if I could find the Station or the Plaza, or any of those landmarks.</t6392> <t6393>Then I would be sure of where I was.</t6393> <t6394>I also thought it would be better for me to go directly to the center of things, rather than moving away.</t6394> <t6395>That would seem more plausible.</t6395>
<t6396>"While we were locked up in the Center, they had installed more checkpoints; they were everywhere."</t6396> <t6397>"Seeing the first one made my hair stand on end."</t6397>
<t6398>I ran into him suddenly, as I turned a corner.</t6398> <t6399>I knew it wouldn't be normal to turn around and retreat right in front of them, so I managed to deceive them the same way I had done at the Center, showing a frown, a rigid body, pressing my lips together, and looking at them directly, as if they were festering sores.</t6399> <t6400>You already know the expression the Aunts adopt when they say the word man.</t6400> <t6401>It worked like a charm, just like at the next checkpoint.</t6401>
<t6402>»But my mind was spinning and spinning, as if I were going crazy.</t6402> <t6403>I only had time until they found the old witch and raised the alarm.</t6403> <t6404>Soon they would start looking for me: an Aunt on foot, an impostor.</t6404> <t6405>I tried to think of something, I mentally went through the list of people I knew.</t6405> <t6406>Finally, I tried to remember what I could from the list of people we used to send information to.</t6406> <t6407>Of course, we had destroyed it a long time ago; rather, we didn't destroy it, we divided it up, each one memorized a section and then we destroyed it.</t6407> <t6408>We still used the postal service, but we no longer put our logo on the envelopes.</t6408> <t6409>It was too risky.</t6409>
<t6410>»So I tried to remember my section of the list.</t6410> <t6411>I won't tell you the name I chose because I don't want to get them in trouble, if they haven't already had it.</t6411> <t6412>It could be that I spilled all this shit, it's hard to remember what you say when they're doing it to you.</t6412> <t6413>You would say anything.</t6413>
<t6414>"I chose them because they were a married couple, and marriages were safer than any single person, and even more so than any homosexual."</t6414> <t6415>"I also remembered the designation that was next to their names."</t6415> <t6416>"It was a Q, which meant Quakers."</t6416>
<t6417>In the case of people who had a religion, we marked them that way.</t6417> <t6418>That way we could know who would be suitable for what.</t6418> <t6419>For example, it wasn't convenient to call a C for an abortion; and it's not like we did many lately.</t6419> <t6420>I also remembered their address.</t6420> <t6421>We had tortured each other with the addresses, it was important to remember them exactly, with the postal code and everything.</t6421>
<t6422>By then I had reached Mass Avenue, and I knew where I was.</t6422> <t6423>And I also knew where they were.</t6423> <t6424>Now I was worried about something else: when these people saw that an Aunt was approaching their house, wouldn't they lock the door and pretend not to be home?</t6424> <t6425>But in any case, I had to try, it was my only option.</t6425> <t6426>I thought it was unlikely that they would shoot me.</t6426> <t6427>At that moment it was around five o'clock.</t6427>
<t6428>She was exhausted from so much walking, especially in the way the Aunts did it, like a damn soldier, with their butt sticking out; besides, she hadn't eaten anything since breakfast time.</t6428>
<t6429>»What, logically, they didn't know was that in those days the existence of the Aunts, and even the Center, were not public knowledge.</t6429> <t6430>At first, everything that happened behind the wire fences was kept secret.</t6430> <t6431>Even then, there might have been objections to what they were doing.</t6431> <t6432>So although some people might have seen the strange Aunt, they really didn't know who she was.</t6432> <t6433>They might have thought she was some kind of army nurse.</t6433> <t6434>People no longer asked questions, unless they had no other choice.</t6434>
<t6435>»So these people let me in right away.</t6435> <t6436>It was the woman who came to open the door.</t6436> <t6437>I told her I was conducting a survey.</t6437> <t6438>I did it so that, in case someone saw us, they wouldn't notice her astonishment.</t6438> <t6439>But as soon as I was inside the house, I took off the headpiece and explained who I was.</t6439> <t6440>They could have called the police, or something like that, I know I was taking that risk, but as I said, I had no other choice.</t6440>
<t6441>Anyway, they didn't do it.</t6441> <t6442>They provided me with some clothes, one of her dresses, and burned the Aunt's suit and the pass in the fireplace; they knew it was the first thing to do.</t6442> <t6443>It was evident that they didn't like having me in their house, it made them nervous.</t6443> <t6444>They had two small children, both under seven years old.</t6444> <t6445>I understood their situation.</t6445>
<t6446>"I went to the bathroom, what a relief."</t6446> <t6447>"And then the bathtub full of plastic fish, etcetera."</t6447>
<t6448>Afterwards, I stayed upstairs in the children's room and played with them and their plastic blocks while their parents were downstairs, deciding what they would do with me.</t6448> <t6449>I wasn't scared; in fact, I felt quite good.</t6449> <t6450>Fatalistic, you would say.</t6450> <t6451>Then the woman made me a sandwich and a cup of coffee, and the man told me that he was going to take me to another house.</t6451> <t6452>They hadn't risked calling on the phone.</t6452>
<t6453>"The people in the other house were also Quakers and represented an interesting resource because they were one of the stations of the Women's Metropolitan Train."</t6453>
<t6454>When the first couple left, they told me they would try to get me out of the country.</t6454> <t6455>I won't say how, because maybe some of the stations still work.</t6455> <t6456>Each of these was in contact with only one of the others, always with the next one.</t6456> <t6457>It had several advantages... it was better if you got caught, but also disadvantages, because if they wiped out one station, the whole chain was dismantled until they managed to establish contact with one of their couriers, who designed a new itinerary.</t6457> <t6458>However, they were better organized than anyone could suppose.</t6458> <t6459>They were infiltrated in a couple of useful places; one of them was the post office.</t6459> <t6460>There they had a driver who drove one of those handy carts.</t6460> <t6461>I managed to cross the bridge and enter the city itself inside a mail sack.</t6461> <t6462>Now I can tell you, because shortly afterward they caught him.</t6462> <t6463>He ended up hanging on the Wall.</t6463> <t6464>You always find out about these things; you would be surprised to know the number of things you find out here.</t6464> <t6465>The Commanders themselves tell you, I imagine they must wonder why they wouldn't, there's no one we can pass the information to, except to the rest of us, and that doesn't matter.</t6465>
<t6466>»As I tell it, it seems easy, but it wasn't.</t6466> <t6467>I was scared shitless the whole time.</t6467> <t6468>One of the worst things was knowing that these people were risking their necks for me without any obligation.</t6468> <t6469>But they said they were doing it for religious reasons and that I shouldn't take it personally.</t6469> <t6470>That helped me in a way.</t6470> <t6471>Every night they organized a session of silent prayers.</t6471> <t6472>At first, it was hard for me to get used to it, as it reminded me too much of the same crap from the Center.</t6472> <t6473>To be honest, it gave me a stomachache.</t6473> <t6474>I had to make an effort and tell myself that this was something completely different.</t6474> <t6475>At first, I hated it.</t6475>
<t6476>But I suppose that is what allowed them to keep going.</t6476> <t6477>They more or less knew what would happen to them if they were discovered.</t6477> <t6478>Not in detail, but they knew.</t6478> <t6479>At that time, they had started to put some of that on television, the trials, and things like that.</t6479>
<t6480>“This was before they seriously started the raids against the sects.</t6480> <t6481>At first, as long as you said you were some kind of Christian and that you were married, they left you alone.</t6481> <t6482>They first focused on the others; but before starting with the rest, they more or less put the first ones under control.</t6482>
<t6483>"I must have been in hiding for about eight or nine months."</t6483> <t6484>"They moved me from one safe house to another, there were more back then."</t6484> <t6485>"Not all of them were Quakers, some of them weren't even religious."</t6485> <t6486>"They were simply people who didn't like the direction things were taking."</t6486>
<t6487>»I was about to make it.</t6487> <t6488>They took me to Salem, and then they moved me in a truck full of chickens to Maine.</t6488> <t6489>I was about to vomit because of the smell.</t6489>
<t6490>Have you ever thought about what it could mean to have an entire truckload of chickens poop on you?</t6490> <t6491>They were planning to make me cross the border there; not by car or truck, because it had become very difficult, but by boat, along the coast.</t6491> <t6492>I didn't know until that very night, they never told you what the next step was until the last minute.</t6492> <t6493>They were that careful.</t6493>
<t6494>"So I don't know what happened."</t6494> <t6495>Maybe someone chickened out, or some outsider started to get suspicious.</t6495> <t6496>Or maybe it was the boat itself, maybe they thought that guy was going out too many times with his boat at night.</t6496> <t6497>At that time, that place must have been swarming with Eyes, like any place near the border.</t6497>
<t6498>Whatever it was, they caught us just as we were leaving through the back door to go down to the dock.</t6498> <t6499>Me and the uncle, and also his wife.</t6499> <t6500>They were an older couple, around fifty years old.</t6500> <t6501>He had been in the lobster business before the whole fishing issue on the coasts happened.</t6501> <t6502>I don't know what happened to them after that, because they took me in a separate van.</t6502>
<t6503>“I thought it was the end for me.”</t6503> <t6504>“Or that they would take me back to the Center, under Aunt Lydia’s care and her steel cable.”</t6504> <t6505>“You know how she liked it.”</t6505> <t6506>“She pretended all that love-the-sinner, hate-the-sin crap but she enjoyed it.”</t6506> <t6507>“I considered the possibility of escaping, and maybe I would have if I had any chance.”</t6507> <t6508>“But in the back of the van, there were two of them with me, watching me like vultures; they hardly said anything, just sat there and observed me with that cross-eyed look they usually have.”</t6508> <t6509>“So it was useless.”</t6509>
<t6510>"However, we did not go to the Center but to another place."</t6510> <t6511>"I will not go into details about what happened afterward."</t6511> <t6512>"It is better that I do not mention it."</t6512> <t6513>"All I can say is that they did not leave any mark on me."</t6513>
<t6514>"When it was all over, they made me watch a movie."</t6514> <t6515>"Do you know what it was about?"</t6515> <t6516>"About life in the Colonies."</t6516> <t6517>"In the Colonies, they spent their time cleaning."</t6517> <t6518>"These days, they are very concerned about cleanliness."</t6518> <t6519>"Sometimes it's just about corpses, after a battle."</t6519> <t6520>"The worst part is what happens in the urban ghettos, because they leave them lying around for a long time and they decompose."</t6520> <t6521>"These people don't like having corpses lying around because they are afraid there might be an epidemic, or something like that."</t6521> <t6522>"So the women in the Colonies take care of burning them."</t6522> <t6523>"Anyway, the other Colonies are worse because of the toxic waste dumping and the spread of radiation."</t6523> <t6524>"They estimate that at most you can survive three years of all this, before your nose falls apart and your skin peels off like taking off a pair of rubber gloves."</t6524> <t6525>"They don't bother to feed them much or give them protective clothing or anything like that, it's cheaper not to."</t6525> <t6526>"Besides, it's mostly people they want to get rid of."</t6526>
<t6527>They say there are other Colonies, not so terrible, where they engage in agriculture: cotton, tomatoes, and all that.</t6527> <t6528>But those were not the ones that appeared in the movie they showed me.</t6528>
<t6529>»They are older women, I bet you've been wondering why you don't see older women around anymore; and Maids who have wasted their three chances, or incorrigibles like me.</t6529> <t6530>All of us who are considered waste.</t6530>
<t6531>They are sterile, of course.</t6531> <t6532>And if they weren't at the beginning, they are after spending some time there.</t6532> <t6533>When they are not sure, they perform a small operation on you to make sure there is no mistake.</t6533> <t6534>I also estimate that in the Colonies, a quarter of them are men.</t6534>
<t6535>Not all those they call Traitors to the Gender end their days at the Wall.</t6535>
<t6536>»Everyone wears long dresses, like those from the Center, but gray.</t6536> <t6537>The women, and the men too, judging by the shots in the movie.</t6537> <t6538>I suppose that making the men wear dresses is meant to degrade them.</t6538> <t6539>Damn, it demoralizes me quite a bit.</t6539> <t6540>And how do you put up with it?</t6540> <t6541>On second thought, I prefer this suit.</t6541>
<t6542>"After that, they told me it was too dangerous to grant me the privilege of returning to the Red Center."</t6542> <t6543>"They said I would be a corrupting influence."</t6543>
<t6544>I could choose: this, or the Colonies.</t6544> <t6545>Well, shit, only a fool would choose the Colonies.</t6545> <t6546>I mean, I'm no martyr.</t6546> <t6547>I had my tubes tied years ago, so I didn't even need the operation.</t6547> <t6548>Besides, no one here has fertile ovaries, imagine the kind of problems that could cause.</t6548>
<t6549>"And here I am."</t6549> <t6550>"They even provide you with face cream."</t6550> <t6551>"You should find a way to come here."</t6551> <t6552>"You'd be fine for two or three years until your opportunity passed and they sent you to the common grave."</t6552> <t6553>"The food isn't bad and if you feel like it, they give you drinks and drugs, and we only work at night."</t6553>
<t6554>—Moira —I gasp—.</t6554> <t6555>You're not serious —it starts to scare me because what I perceive in her voice is indifference, a lack of will.</t6555> <t6556>Have they really done this to her, taken away something —what?— that used to be so essential to her?</t6556> <t6557>How can I expect her to succeed, to still live up to my idea of her as a brave person, to survive, if I myself am not capable of doing so?</t6557>
<t6558>I don't want her to be like me: to give up, to resign, to save her skin.</t6558> <t6559>That's what we've been reduced to.</t6559> <t6560>But from her, I expect courage, bravado, heroism, self-sufficiency: all that I lack.</t6560>
<t6561>—Don't worry about me —he reassures me.</t6561> <t6562>He must imagine what I'm thinking—.</t6562>
<t6563>I'm still here, you see it's me.</t6563> <t6564>Anyway, consider it this way: it's not so bad, I'm surrounded by a bunch of women.</t6564> <t6565>We could call it the lost paradise.</t6565>
<t6566>Now he is joking, showing me that he still has energy, and I feel better.</t6566>
<t6567>—Do they allow it? —I ask her.</t6567>
<t6568>—If they allow us?</t6568> <t6569>Damn, they incite us.</t6569> <t6570>Do you know what they call this place?</t6570> <t6571>Jezebel’s.</t6571> <t6572>The Aunts suppose that we are condemned anyway, they have given up on us, so it doesn't matter what kind of vice we take up, and the Commanders couldn't care less about what we do in our free time.</t6572> <t6573>Besides, it seems that seeing a woman with another excites them.</t6573>
<t6574>—And the others? —I asked.</t6574>
<t6575>—Let's say —he responds— that they are not very fond of men.</t6575> <t6576>—He shrugs again.</t6576> <t6577>It must be resignation.</t6577>
<t6578>This is what I would like to tell.</t6578> <t6579>I would like to tell how Moira escaped, this time successfully.</t6579> <t6580>And if I can't tell that, I would like to say that she blew up Jezebel’s, with fifty Commanders inside.</t6580> <t6581>I would like her to end with something daring and spectacular, some attack, something appropriate to her.</t6581> <t6582>But, as far as I know, none of that happened.</t6582> <t6583>I don't know how it ended, not even if it ended in any way, because I never saw her again.</t6583>
<t6584>CHAPTER 39</t6584>
<t6585>The Commander has the key to a room.</t6585> <t6586>He took it from the desk in front, while I waited on the flowered sofa.</t6586> <t6587>He shows it to me with a timid gesture.</t6587> <t6588>I'm supposed to understand.</t6588>
<t6589>We went up in the glass half-egg of the elevator and passed by the balconies adorned with vines.</t6589> <t6590>I must also understand that I am on display.</t6590>
<t6591>Open the room's door with the key.</t6591> <t6592>Everything is the same, exactly the same as centuries ago.</t6592> <t6593>The curtains are the same, the thickest ones with a floral pattern —orange poppies on a blue background— matching the bedspread, and the thin white ones to filter the sunlight; the dresser and the corner nightstands, impersonal; the lamps and the paintings on the walls: a bowl with fruit, stylized apples, flowers in a vase, ranunculus and gladiolus matching the curtains.</t6593> <t6594>Everything remains the same.</t6594>
<t6595>I tell the Commander to wait a minute and I enter the bathroom.</t6595> <t6596>My ears are buzzing because of the cigarette and the gin has completely relaxed me.</t6596>
<t6597>I moisten a small towel and place it on my forehead.</t6597> <t6598>A moment later, I check if there is any small individually wrapped soap.</t6598> <t6599>Yes, there is, and they are the ones that come from Spain, with the drawing of a gypsy woman.</t6599>
<t6600>I inhale the smell of soap, a disinfectant smell, and I stay in the bathroom, listening to the distant sounds of running water, of toilet chains.</t6600> <t6601>It's strange, but I feel comfortable, like at home.</t6601> <t6602>There is something reassuring about bathrooms.</t6602> <t6603>At least physical functions are still democratic.</t6603> <t6604>Everyone shits, Moira would say.</t6604>
<t6605>I sit on the edge of the bathtub and observe the white towels.</t6605> <t6606>At one time, they had seemed exciting to me.</t6606> <t6607>They represented the aftermath of love.</t6607>
<t6608>I saw your mother, Moira told me.</t6608>
<t6609>Where?, I asked her.</t6609> <t6610>I felt myself shudder and realized that I had been thinking of her as if she were dead.</t6610>
<t6611>Not in person, but in the movie they showed me about the Colonies.</t6611> <t6612>There was a close-up in which she appeared.</t6612> <t6613>She was wrapped in one of those gray things, but I know it was her.</t6613>
<t6614>Thank God, I said.</t6614>
<t6615>Thank God for what?, Moira wondered.</t6615>
<t6616>I thought she was dead.</t6616>
<t6617>It would be better if he were, Moira stated.</t6617> <t6618>That is what you should wish for him.</t6618>
<t6619>I can't remember when was the last time I saw her.</t6619> <t6620>It blends together with all the others; it was some unimportant occasion.</t6620> <t6621>She must have dropped by my house; she used to do that, coming and going carelessly from my house as if I were the mother and she the daughter.</t6621> <t6622>She still retained all her liveliness.</t6622> <t6623>Sometimes, while moving from one apartment to another, she would bring her dirty clothes to wash them in my washer-dryer.</t6623>
<t6624>Maybe she stopped by the house to borrow something: a pot, the hair dryer.</t6624> <t6625>This was also one of her habits.</t6625>
<t6626>I didn't know it would be the last time we would see each other; otherwise, I would have remembered it better.</t6626> <t6627>I don't even remember what we said.</t6627>
<t6628>A week later, two weeks, three, when suddenly things got even worse, I tried to call her.</t6628> <t6629>But I got no answer, and later, when I tried again, neither.</t6629>
<t6630>He hadn't told me that he was thinking of going anywhere, but maybe he had left without telling me; he didn't always do so.</t6630> <t6631>He had his own car, and he wasn't too old to drive.</t6631>
<t6632>Finally, I managed to speak on the phone with the building's security guard.</t6632> <t6633>He said that he hadn't seen her lately.</t6633>
<t6634>I was worried.</t6634> <t6635>I thought that maybe she had had a heart attack or a stroke, although it was unlikely because, as far as I knew, she had not been sick.</t6635> <t6636>She was always in very good health.</t6636> <t6637>She still worked at Nautilus and went swimming every two weeks.</t6637> <t6638>I used to tell my friends that she was healthier than me, and maybe it was true.</t6638>
<t6639>Luke and I drove to the city, and Luke forced the guard to open the apartment.</t6639> <t6640>She could be lying on the floor, dead, insisted Luke.</t6640> <t6641>The longer you leave her, the worse it will be.</t6641> <t6642>Can you imagine the smell?</t6642> <t6643>The guard said something about needing a permit, but Luke knew how to be persuasive.</t6643> <t6644>He made it clear that we weren't planning to wait or leave.</t6644> <t6645>I started to cry.</t6645> <t6646>Maybe this was what finally convinced him.</t6646>
<t6647>When the man opened the door, what we found was utter chaos.</t6647>
<t6648>There were furniture pieces turned upside down, the mattress was torn, the drawers of the dresser were thrown on the floor, face down, and their contents scattered and piled up.</t6648> <t6649>But my mother was not there.</t6649>
<t6650>I'm going to call the police, I said.</t6650> <t6651>I had stopped crying; I felt a shiver run through my body from head to toe, and my teeth were chattering.</t6651>
<t6652>Don't do it, Luke advised me.</t6652>
<t6653>Why not?, I asked him, staring at him intently; now I was furious.</t6653> <t6654>He stood in the middle of the remnants of the room and just looked at me.</t6654> <t6655>He put his hands in his pockets, one of those unintended gestures people adopt when they don't know what to do.</t6655>
<t6656>Just don't do it, he said.</t6656>
<t6657>Your mother is very clean, Moira told me when we were going to university.</t6657> <t6658>Some time later: she is shameless.</t6658> <t6659>Even later: she is cunning.</t6659>
<t6660>She is not cunning, I replied.</t6660> <t6661>She is my mother.</t6661>
<t6662>Yeah, Moira laughed, you should see mine.</t6662>
<t6663>I think of my mother collecting lethal toxins; that's how old women in Russia used to end their days, sweeping up filth.</t6663> <t6664>Only this filth will kill her.</t6664> <t6665>I can't believe it.</t6665> <t6666>Surely her boldness, her optimism and energy, her cunning, will get her out of it.</t6666> <t6667>She will come up with something.</t6667>
<t6668>But I know this is not true.</t6668> <t6669>It's simply passing the buck, like children do with their mothers.</t6669>
<t6670>I have already mourned their death.</t6670> <t6671>But I will do it again, over and over.</t6671>
<t6672>Return to the present, to the hotel.</t6672> <t6673>This is where I need to be.</t6673> <t6674>I take a look at myself in this huge mirror, under the white light.</t6674>
<t6675>She looked at me intently and penetratingly.</t6675> <t6676>I am a wreck.</t6676> <t6677>The makeup has smeared again despite Moira's touch-ups, the purple lipstick has faded, and my hair is disheveled.</t6677> <t6678>The pink feathers look gaudy like those of a carnival doll, and some of the star-shaped sequins have fallen off.</t6678>
<t6679>They were probably missing from the beginning, and I didn't notice.</t6679> <t6680>I look like a badly made-up transvestite wearing someone else's clothes.</t6680>
<t6681>I would like to have a toothbrush.</t6681>
<t6682>I could stay here, thinking about all of this, but time passes.</t6682>
<t6683>I must be back at the house before midnight; otherwise, I will turn into a pumpkin...</t6683> <t6684>Or was that what happened to the carriage?</t6684> <t6685>According to the calendar, the Ceremony is celebrated tomorrow, so Serena wants me to be mounted tonight, and if I'm not there, she will find out the reason, and then what?</t6685>
<t6686>And the Commander is waiting, for a change; I hear him pacing in the main room.</t6686> <t6687>Now he stops on the other side of the bathroom door and clears his throat with a theatrical ahem.</t6687> <t6688>I turn on the hot water tap to indicate that I am ready, or something like that.</t6688> <t6689>I have to get this over with.</t6689> <t6690>I wash my hands.</t6690> <t6691>I have to be careful of inertia.</t6691>
<t6692>When I go out, I find him lying on the huge bed and notice that he has taken off his shoes.</t6692> <t6693>I lie down next to him, he doesn't have to tell me.</t6693> <t6694>I would prefer not to do it, but it's good to stretch out, I am very tired.</t6694>
<t6695>Finally alone, I think.</t6695> <t6696>The thing is, I don't want to be alone with him, not on the bed.</t6696> <t6697>I would prefer Serena to be present as well.</t6697> <t6698>I would prefer to play Intelect.</t6698>
<t6699>But my silence does not discourage him.</t6699>
<t6700>—It's tomorrow, right? —he asks softly—.</t6700> <t6701>I thought we could get ahead of it —he turns to me.</t6701>
<t6702>—Why have you brought me here? —I say to him coldly.</t6702>
<t6703>Now it caresses my body; from bow to stern, as they used to say, with feline caresses along the left side, going down the left leg.</t6703> <t6704>It stops upon reaching the foot and encircles my ankle with its fingers, briefly, like a bracelet, where the tattoo is, as if reading the Braille system, as if it were a cattle brand.</t6704> <t6705>It means ownership.</t6705>
<t6706>I remind myself that he is not an unpleasant man; that, under different circumstances, I might even like him.</t6706>
<t6707>His hands stop.</t6707>
<t6708>—I thought you might like a change —knowing that isn't enough—.</t6708> <t6709>I supposed it was some kind of experiment —that's not enough either.</t6709> <t6710>You said you wanted to know.</t6710>
<t6711>He sits up and starts unbuttoning his clothes.</t6711> <t6712>Will it be worse to see him stripped of the power that his clothes confer?</t6712> <t6713>He has taken off his shirt, and underneath it appears a sad and small belly.</t6713> <t6714>And some tufts of hair.</t6714>
<t6715>He lowers one of my straps and slides the other hand between the feathers; but it's useless, there I stay like a dead bird.</t6715> <t6716>He is not a monster, I think.</t6716> <t6717>I cannot afford the luxury of feeling pride or aversion, there are many things one must give up under certain circumstances.</t6717>
<t6718>—Maybe it would be better if I turned off the light —says the Commander, dismayed and undoubtedly disappointed.</t6718> <t6719>Before he turns off the light, I see him.</t6719> <t6720>Without the uniform, he looks smaller, older, as if he were starting to dry up.</t6720> <t6721>The problem is that I can't behave with him in a way different from the usual.</t6721> <t6722>And usually, I show myself as inert.</t6722> <t6723>Surely there is something more for us here, something that isn't this futility and sentimentality.</t6723>
<t6724>Pretend, I screamed mentally to myself.</t6724> <t6725>You must remember how to do it.</t6725> <t6726>Finish this once and for all or you'll spend the whole night here.</t6726> <t6727>Move.</t6727> <t6728>Breathe heavily. It's the least you can do.</t6728>
<t6729>Thirteen</t6729>
<t6730>THE NIGHT</t6730>
<t6731>CHAPTER 40</t6731>
<t6732>At night, the heat is worse than during the day.</t6732> <t6733>Despite the fan being on, everything remains still; the walls accumulate heat and release it as if they were a lit oven.</t6733> <t6734>Surely it will rain soon.</t6734> <t6735>Why do I wish for it?</t6735> <t6736>It will only mean more humidity.</t6736> <t6737>In the distance, a lightning bolt can be seen, but no thunder is heard.</t6737> <t6738>I can see it from the window, a flickering light —like the phosphorescence perceived in a choppy sea— behind the cloudy sky, very low and of a dull infrared gray color.</t6738> <t6739>The spotlights are off, which is unusual.</t6739> <t6740>A power outage.</t6740> <t6741>Or Serena Joy might have arranged it that way.</t6741>
<t6742>I sit in the darkness; there's no point in leaving the light on, they would realize that I'm still awake.</t6742> <t6743>I am fully dressed, once again in my red habit, after having removed the sequins and wiped off the lipstick with toilet paper.</t6743> <t6744>I hope nothing is noticeable, I hope I don't smell like makeup, nor like him.</t6744>
<t6745>She will be here at midnight, just as she said.</t6745> <t6746>I can hear her, a faint tapping, a faint shuffling of feet on the thick carpet of the hallway, and then a soft knock on the door.</t6746> <t6747>I say nothing, but I follow her down the hallway and then downstairs.</t6747> <t6748>She walks quickly, she is stronger than I thought.</t6748> <t6749>She grips the banister with her left hand, perhaps because of the pain and also to steady herself.</t6749> <t6750>I think: she is biting her lips, she is suffering.</t6750> <t6751>There is no doubt that she wants the baby.</t6751> <t6752>In the glass eye that forms the mirror, as we descend, I see us both, a blue silhouette, a red silhouette.</t6752> <t6753>Me and my reverse.</t6753>
<t6754>Let's go to the kitchen.</t6754> <t6755>It is deserted and a small lamp has been left on; you can feel the calm that reigns during the night in empty kitchens.</t6755> <t6756>The bowls on the shelf, the cans, and the clay containers looming menacingly under the dim light.</t6756> <t6757>The knives are stored in their wooden holder.</t6757>
<t6758>—I won't go out with you —she whispers.</t6758> <t6759>It's strange to hear her whisper, as if she were one of us.</t6759> <t6760>Normally, Wives don't lower their voices—.</t6760> <t6761>Go out the door and turn right.</t6761> <t6762>You'll find another door; it's open.</t6762> <t6763>Go up the stairs and knock, he's waiting for you.</t6763> <t6764>No one will see you.</t6764> <t6765>I'll stay here —then she'll wait for me, in case any problem arises.</t6765> <t6766>In case Cora or Rita get up, who knows why, and come to the back of the kitchen.</t6766> <t6767>What will she tell them?</t6767> <t6768>That she couldn't sleep.</t6768> <t6769>That she wanted some warm milk.</t6769> <t6770>She'll be skillful enough to tell them a lie, that I already know—.</t6770> <t6771>The Commander is upstairs, in his room —she explains to me—.</t6771> <t6772>He won't come down at this time of night.</t6772> <t6773>He never does —that's what she believes.</t6773>
<t6774>I open the kitchen door, step outside, and wait a moment for my eyes to adjust to the darkness.</t6774> <t6775>It's been a long time since I've been out alone at night.</t6775> <t6776>Now a thunder is heard, the storm is approaching.</t6776> <t6777>What will he have done regarding the Guardians?</t6777> <t6778>They could shoot me thinking I'm a prowler.</t6778> <t6779>He must have paid them with something, or so I hope: cigarettes, whiskey, or maybe they know everything, this whole stallion business, maybe if this doesn't work, he'll make me try with them next.</t6779>
<t6780>The door leading to the garage is just a few steps away.</t6780> <t6781>I walk on the grass with silent steps and slip inside.</t6781> <t6782>The staircase is in darkness, so much so that I can't see anything.</t6782> <t6783>I climb up groping, step by step: there is a carpet, I imagine it is mushroom-colored.</t6783> <t6784>Once, this must have been an apartment for a student, a young and single person with a job.</t6784> <t6785>There used to be a lot of big houses around here where they lived.</t6785> <t6786>A bachelor pad, that's what they called this type of apartment.</t6786> <t6787>I like to check that I am able to remember it.</t6787> <t6788>Private entrance, they put in the ads, which meant they could bring a little friend without anyone noticing.</t6788>
<t6789>I reach the end of the stairs and knock on the door.</t6789> <t6790>He himself opens it, who else?</t6790>
<t6791>There is a lamp on, only one but powerful enough to make me blink.</t6791> <t6792>I look inside the room, I don't want to look him in the eyes.</t6792> <t6793>It is a single room with a folding bed, which is already prepared, and a small built-in kitchen at the other end and another door that must lead to the bathroom.</t6793>
<t6794>A dismantled room, military style and tiny.</t6794> <t6795>There are no pictures on the walls, nor plants.</t6795> <t6796>He camps here.</t6796> <t6797>The blanket on the bed is gray and bears the inscription U. S.</t6797>
<t6798>He takes a step back and lets me in.</t6798> <t6799>He is in shirt sleeves and has a lit cigarette in his hand.</t6799> <t6800>I perceive the smell of smoke, on him, in the hot air of the room, everywhere.</t6800> <t6801>I would like to take off my clothes and bathe in this smell, rub my skin with it.</t6801>
<t6802>No preliminaries; he knows why I am here.</t6802> <t6803>He doesn't even say anything, why waste time on nonsense, this is about a job.</t6803> <t6804>He moves away from me and turns off the lamp.</t6804> <t6805>Outside, like punctuation, a flash of lightning is seen; almost immediately the thunder is heard.</t6805> <t6806>He is taking off my dress, he is a man made of darkness, I can't see his face, I can barely breathe, I can barely endure it, and I am not resisting.</t6806> <t6807>I feel his mouth on me, his hands, I can't wait and he is already moving, love, it's been so long, I feel life pulsing in my skin, again, arms around him, as if falling into water softly, without finding the end.</t6807>
<t6808>I knew it could be just once.</t6808>
<t6809>I made it up.</t6809> <t6810>It didn't happen that way.</t6810> <t6811>What happened is the following: I reach the end of the stairs and knock on the door..</t6811> <t6812>He himself is the one who opens it.</t6812> <t6813>There is a lamp on; I blink.</t6813> <t6814>I look inside the room, it is a single room, dismantled, military-style, the bed is already made.</t6814> <t6815>There are no pictures, but the blanket has the inscription U. S.</t6815> <t6816>He is in his shirt sleeves and has a cigarette.</t6816>
<t6817>—Ten —he tells me—, take a puff —no preliminaries, he knows why I'm here.</t6817> <t6818>To get pregnant, to get into trouble, in over my head, as they used to say.</t6818> <t6819>I take the cigarette from his hands, take a deep puff, and give it back to him.</t6819> <t6820>Our fingers barely touch.</t6820> <t6821>Even that puff makes me dizzy.</t6821>
<t6822>He doesn't say anything, he just looks at me with a serious expression.</t6822> <t6823>It would be better and more pleasant if he touched me.</t6823> <t6824>I feel stupid and horrible, although I know I'm not.</t6824> <t6825>However, what does he think, why doesn't he say anything?</t6825> <t6826>Maybe he thinks that at Jezebel's I've been fooling around with the Commander.</t6826> <t6827>It bothers me that I still care about what he thinks.</t6827> <t6828>Let's be practical.</t6828>
<t6829>—I don't have much time —I warn him.</t6829> <t6830>It sounds awkward and untimely, it's not what I meant to say.</t6830>
<t6831>—I could squirt some into a bottle and then you could stick it in yourself —he replies.</t6831>
<t6832>He doesn't smile.</t6832>
<t6833>—There is no need for you to be cruel —I tell him.</t6833> <t6834>Maybe he feels used.</t6834> <t6835>Perhaps he expects something from me, some emotion, some recognition that he is also human, that he is something more than just a mere seed—.</t6835> <t6836>I know it is difficult for you —</t6836>
<t6837>I suggest.</t6837>
<t6838>He shrugs.</t6838>
<t6839>—I get paid —he says in a grumpy tone.</t6839> <t6840>But he still doesn't move.</t6840>
<t6841>I get paid, you go to bed, I hum to myself, So that's how we'll do it.</t6841> <t6842>He doesn't like makeup or sequins.</t6842> <t6843>We're going to be tough.</t6843>
<t6844>—Do you come here often?</t6844>
<t6845>—And what is a girl like me doing in a place like this? —I respond.</t6845> <t6846>We both smile: that's better.</t6846> <t6847>It's an acknowledgment that we are acting because,</t6847>
<t6848>What else can we do in such a situation?</t6848>
<t6849>—Abstinence softens the heart —we are quoting lines from old movies, from other times.</t6849> <t6850>And even back then, they were old movies: that way of speaking belongs to a time quite earlier than ours.</t6850> <t6851>Not even my mother spoke like that, as far as I can remember.</t6851> <t6852>Perhaps no one ever spoke like that in real life and it was all something fabricated from the beginning.</t6852> <t6853>However, it is astonishing how easily these clichéd and falsely cheerful sexual jokes come to mind.</t6853> <t6854>Now I understand what they mean, what they have always meant: to keep the essence of each person out of danger, enclosed, protected.</t6854>
<t6855>I am sad, the way both of them speak is infinitely sad: a music that fades away, paper flowers that wither, worn-out satin, the echo of an echo.</t6855>
<t6856>Everything is over, nothing is possible anymore.</t6856> <t6857>Suddenly, I burst into tears.</t6857>
<t6858>Finally, he moves, wraps his arms around me, caresses my back, comforts me.</t6858>
<t6859>—Come on —he says—.</t6859> <t6860>We don't have much time —without removing his arm from my shoulders, he leads me to the folding bed and lays me down, first pulling back the sheet.</t6860>
<t6861>He starts to unbutton himself, then he caresses me and kisses my ear—.</t6861> <t6862>No romantic fantasies —he tells me—.</t6862> <t6863>Agreed?</t6863>
<t6864>Once, this would have meant something else.</t6864> <t6865>Once, it would have meant: no strings attached.</t6865> <t6866>Now it means: no heroics.</t6866> <t6867>It means: if it comes to it, don't risk yourself for me.</t6867>
<t6868>And that's how it happened.</t6868>
<t6869>I knew it could be just once.</t6869> <t6870>Goodbye, I even thought at that moment, goodbye.</t6870>
<t6871>However, no thunder sounded, I added.</t6871> <t6872>To cover the noises that embarrass me to make.</t6872>
<t6873>It didn't happen that way either.</t6873> <t6874>I'm not sure how it happened, not exactly.</t6874> <t6875>All I can do is a reconstruction: the way love feels is always approximate.</t6875>
<t6876>In the midst of all this, I thought of Serena Joy, who was sitting in the kitchen, thinking in turn: it turned out to be easy.</t6876> <t6877>They would spread their legs for anyone.</t6877> <t6878>All you have to do is give them a cigarette.</t6878>
<t6879>And then I thought: this is a betrayal.</t6879> <t6880>Not the fact itself, but my reaction.</t6880>
<t6881>If I were sure that he is dead, would there be any difference?</t6881>
<t6882>I wish I didn't feel shame.</t6882> <t6883>I would like to be shameless.</t6883> <t6884>I would like to be ignorant.</t6884> <t6885>Then I wouldn't know how ignorant I am.</t6885>
<t6886>14</t6886>
<t6887>THE RESCUE</t6887>
<t6888>CHAPTER 41</t6888>
<t6889>I would like this story to be different.</t6889> <t6890>I would like it to be more civilized.</t6890> <t6891>I would like it to give a better impression of me, if not as a happy person, at least more active, less hesitant, less distracted by trivialities.</t6891> <t6892>I would like it to have a more defined form.</t6892> <t6893>I would like it to be about love, or significant achievements in life, or about sunsets, or birds, storms, or snow.</t6893>
<t6894>Perhaps, in a certain sense, it is a story about all of this; but in the meantime, there are many things that cross the path, many whispers, many speculations about other people, much gossip that cannot be verified, many unspoken words, much stealth and secrets.</t6894> <t6895>And there is much time to endure, a time as heavy as fried food or thick fog; and, suddenly, these bloody events, like explosions, in streets that would otherwise be decorous, serene, and somnolent.</t6895>
<t6896>I lament that in this story there is so much pain.</t6896> <t6897>And I lament that it is in fragments, like someone caught between two fires or shattered by force.</t6897> <t6898>But I can do nothing to change it.</t6898>
<t6899>I have also tried to show some of the good things.</t6899> <t6900>For example, the flowers, because where would we have gotten without them?</t6900>
<t6901>Anyway, it hurts me to tell it over and over again.</t6901> <t6902>Once was enough: wasn't it enough for me at the time?</t6902> <t6903>That's why I continue with this sad, eager, sordid, lame, and mutilated story, because after all I want you to hear it, just as I would like to hear yours if the opportunity ever arises, if I find you or if you escape, in the future, or in Heaven, in prison or in hiding, anywhere else.</t6903> <t6904>What they have in common is that they are not here.</t6904>
<t6905>By telling you something, anything, at least I am believing in you, believing that you are there, I believe in your existence.</t6905> <t6906>Because by telling you this story, I make you exist.</t6906> <t6907>I tell, therefore you exist.</t6907>
<t6908>So I will continue.</t6908> <t6909>I will force myself to continue.</t6909> <t6910>We have reached a part that you will not like at all because I did not behave well, but nevertheless I will try not to leave anything out.</t6910> <t6911>After all you have been through, you deserve what remains, which is not much but contains the truth.</t6911>
<t6912>So this is the story.</t6912>
<t6913>I met with Nick again.</t6913> <t6914>Time and time again, on my own, without Serena knowing.</t6914> <t6915>No one asked me to, there were no excuses.</t6915> <t6916>I didn't do it for him, but only for myself.</t6916> <t6917>I didn't even think I was giving myself to him because, what did I have to give?</t6917> <t6918>I didn't feel generous but grateful every time he received me.</t6918> <t6919>He had no obligation.</t6919>
<t6920>Because of this, I became reckless, I made stupid choices.</t6920> <t6921>After being with the Commander, I would climb the stairs as usual, but then I would sneak down the hallway and go down the Marthas' staircase and exit through the kitchen.</t6921> <t6922>Every time I heard the click of the kitchen door behind me —so metallic, like a mousetrap or a weapon— I thought about turning back, but I didn't.</t6922> <t6923>I hurried across the few meters of illuminated grass; the spotlight would pass again and I waited to feel the bullets piercing me at any moment, even before hearing the shots.</t6923> <t6924>I groped my way up the stairs and leaned against the door; the blood rushed to my head.</t6924> <t6925>Fear is a powerful stimulant.</t6925> <t6926>Then I would knock on the door softly, like a beggar would.</t6926> <t6927>Every time I did it, I feared that he had left; or, worse yet, that he would tell me I couldn't come in.</t6927> <t6928>He could tell me that he didn't want to keep breaking the rules, that he didn't want to have his neck on the line because of me.</t6928> <t6929>Or, even worse, that he would tell me he was no longer interested.</t6929> <t6930>The fact that he didn't tell me any of these things seemed like an incredible stroke of luck to me.</t6930>
<t6931>I told you it was terrible.</t6931>
<t6932>And this is what happens.</t6932>
<t6933>He opens the door.</t6933> <t6934>He is in shirt sleeves, with his shirt untucked, loose; in his hand, he carries a toothbrush, or a cigarette, or a glass with some drink.</t6934> <t6935>Here he has his own hideout, I suppose for things from the black market.</t6935>
<t6936>She always carries something in her hand, as if she were busy with her usual tasks, as if she weren't waiting for me.</t6936> <t6937>And maybe she isn't waiting for me.</t6937> <t6938>Perhaps she has no idea about the future, or she doesn't bother or doesn't dare to imagine it.</t6938>
<t6939>—Am I too late? —I ask him.</t6939>
<t6940>He shakes his head no.</t6940> <t6941>Between us, it is already understood that it is never too late, but I fulfill the ritual courtesy of asking him.</t6941> <t6942>That makes me feel calmer, as if there were some alternative, a decision that could be made one way or another.</t6942> <t6943>He steps aside, I enter, and he closes the door.</t6943> <t6944>Then he crosses the room and closes the window; afterwards, he turns off the light.</t6944> <t6945>At this stage, there is no conversation between us anymore; I am already half-naked.</t6945> <t6946>We save the conversation for later.</t6946>
<t6947>When I am with the Commander, I close my eyes, even when it is just the goodnight kiss.</t6947> <t6948>I don't want to see him so close.</t6948> <t6949>But here I always keep my eyes open.</t6949> <t6950>I wish there were some light on, maybe a candle stuck in a bottle, some reminiscence of school days, but it wouldn't be worth the risk; so I have to settle for the spotlight and the glow that comes from below, filtered through the white curtains, which are the same as mine.</t6950> <t6951>I want to see as much of him as I can, take him in, memorize him, keep him in my mind so I can live off his image later: the lines of his body, the texture of his skin, the shine of sweat on his skin, his long, sardonic, and unrevealing face.</t6951> <t6952>I should have done the same with Luke, paid more attention to the details, the moles and scars, his wrinkles; I didn't, and now his image is starting to fade.</t6952> <t6953>It fades day by day, night by night, and I become more unfaithful.</t6953>
<t6954>For this man, I would put on pink feathers, purple stars, if he wanted; or anything else, even a rabbit's tail.</t6954> <t6955>But he does not demand those adornments from me.</t6955> <t6956>We make love each time as if we knew without the slightest shadow of a doubt that there would be no other occasion, for either of us, with anyone, ever.</t6956> <t6957>And when the next occasion arrives, it is always a surprise, an extra thing, a gift.</t6957>
<t6958>Being here with him is being safe; it’s like a cave where we huddle while the storm rages outside.</t6958> <t6959>It’s an illusion, of course.</t6959> <t6960>This room is one of the most dangerous places I could be.</t6960> <t6961>If they caught me, they wouldn’t give me any quarter, but I don’t care.</t6961> <t6962>And how have I come to trust him in this way, which is reckless in itself?</t6962> <t6963>How can I assume that I know him, even minimally, and that I know what he’s really doing?</t6963>
<t6964>I overlook these annoying whispers.</t6964> <t6965>I talk too much.</t6965> <t6966>I tell him things I shouldn't tell him.</t6966> <t6967>I talk to him about Moira, about Deglen; but never about Luke.</t6967> <t6968>I want to tell him about the woman in my room, the one who was here before me, but I don't.</t6968> <t6969>I'm jealous of her.</t6969> <t6970>If she was here before me, in this bed, I don't want to know.</t6970>
<t6971>I tell him my real name and from that moment on, I feel recognized.</t6971> <t6972>I act like a fool and I know I shouldn't do it.</t6972> <t6973>I've turned him into an idol, a cardboard cutout.</t6973>
<t6974>He, for his part, speaks little: neither evasive answers nor jokes.</t6974> <t6975>He barely asks questions.</t6975> <t6976>He seems indifferent to most of the things I tell him and only shows interest in the possibilities of my body, although when I speak he looks at me.</t6976>
<t6977>Looks me in the face.</t6977>
<t6978>It is impossible for me to think that someone for whom I feel so much gratitude could betray me.</t6978>
<t6979>Neither of them utters the word love, not even once.</t6979> <t6980>It would be tempting fate; it would mean romance, and misfortune.</t6980>
<t6981>Today there are different flowers, drier, more defined, they are the flowers of midsummer: daisies and rudbeckias, which grow along the descending slope.</t6981> <t6982>I see them in the gardens as I walk back and forth with Deglen.</t6982> <t6983>I barely listen to her; I no longer believe her.</t6983> <t6984>The things she tells me seem unreal.</t6984> <t6985>What meaning do they have for me now?</t6985>
<t6986>You could enter his room at night, whisper.</t6986> <t6987>And look at his desk.</t6987>
<t6988>There must be papers, notes.</t6988>
<t6989>The door is locked, I explain to him.</t6989>
<t6990>We can get you a key, he says.</t6990> <t6991>Don't you want to know who it is, what they do?</t6991>
<t6992>But the Commander no longer represents an immediate interest to me.</t6992> <t6993>I have to make an effort so that my indifference towards him is not noticeable.</t6993>
<t6994>Keep doing everything exactly as you have been, Nick advises me.</t6994> <t6995>Don't change anything; otherwise, they would notice.</t6995> <t6996>He kisses me, looking at me the whole time.</t6996>
<t6997>Promised?</t6997> <t6998>Don't mess it up.</t6998>
<t6999>He placed his hand on my belly.</t6999> <t7000>It has happened, I announce.</t7000> <t7001>I can feel it.</t7001> <t7002>A couple more weeks and I will be sure.</t7002>
<t7003>I know it is an illusion.</t7003>
<t7004>He will be delighted with you, she tells me, And so will she.</t7004>
<t7005>But it's yours, I tell him.</t7005> <t7006>It will be yours, truly.</t7006> <t7007>I want it to be.</t7007>
<t7008>In any case, it is not our aspiration.</t7008>
<t7009>I can't, I tell Deglen.</t7009> <t7010>I'm very scared.</t7010> <t7011>Besides, I wouldn't do it well, they would catch me.</t7011>
<t7012>I don't even bother to look distressed, that's how far my laziness goes.</t7012>
<t7013>We could get you out, he insists.</t7013> <t7014>We can get people out if it's really necessary, if they are in danger, in imminent danger.</t7014>
<t7015>The thing is that I no longer want to leave, nor escape, nor cross the border towards freedom.</t7015> <t7016>I want to stay here, with Nick, where I can be with him.</t7016>
<t7017>When I say this, I am ashamed of myself.</t7017> <t7018>But that is not all.</t7018> <t7019>Even now, I acknowledge that this confession is a kind of boast.</t7019> <t7020>There is something of pride in it, because it shows the extremity of the situation and, therefore, justifies it.</t7020> <t7021>It is well worth it.</t7021> <t7022>It is like the story of an illness from which you have recovered after being on the brink of death; like war stories.</t7022> <t7023>They demonstrate a certain gravity.</t7023>
<t7024>It had not seemed possible to me such seriousness regarding a man.</t7024>
<t7025>Sometimes it was more rational.</t7025> <t7026>I never thought of it in terms of love.</t7026> <t7027>I thought: here, in a way, I have made my life on my own.</t7027> <t7028>That must have been what the wives of the colonizers thought, and the women who survived the wars, if they still had a man.</t7028> <t7029>Humanity is very adaptable, my mother used to say.</t7029> <t7030>It is truly surprising how many things people can get used to as long as there is some compensation.</t7030>
<t7031>It won't be long now, comments Cora, arranging my sanitary cloths for this month into a pile.</t7031> <t7032>Not long, and she smiles at me with a shy yet cunning expression.</t7032> <t7033>Does she know?</t7033> <t7034>Do she and Rita know what I do, know that at night I go down the stairs they use?</t7034> <t7035>Could I have given myself away daydreaming, smiling at any little thing, touching my face gently when I think they aren't looking?</t7035>
<t7036>Deglen is starting to give up on me.</t7036> <t7037>She whispers less and talks more about the weather.</t7037> <t7038>I don't regret it.</t7038> <t7039>I feel relieved.</t7039>
<t7040>CHAPTER 42</t7040>
<t7041>The bells are tolling; they sound quite far away.</t7041> <t7042>It's morning, and today we haven't had breakfast.</t7042> <t7043>Upon reaching the main door, we went out in rows of two.</t7043>
<t7044>There is a thick contingent of guards, specially appointed Angels, with riot gear —helmets with dark plexiglass visors that give them the appearance of beetles, long batons, gas canisters— forming a cordon around the outside of the Wall.</t7044> <t7045>All this is in case of any instances of hysteria.</t7045> <t7046>The hooks on the Wall are empty.</t7046>
<t7047>This is a local Salvaging, only for women.</t7047> <t7048>The Salvagings are always separate.</t7048> <t7049>This one was announced yesterday.</t7049> <t7050>They don't announce it until a day before.</t7050> <t7051>It's little time to get used to it.</t7051>
<t7052>We advance towards where the bells are ringing, along the paths that were once used by students, and pass by buildings that were once classrooms and dormitories.</t7052> <t7053>It feels very strange to be here again.</t7053> <t7054>Seen from the outside, anyone would say that nothing has changed, except that the blinds on most of the windows are down.</t7054> <t7055>Now, these buildings belong to the Eyes.</t7055>
<t7056>We march in a line across the wide meadow, in front of what used to be the library.</t7056> <t7057>The white staircase remains the same, and the main entrance remains unchanged.</t7057>
<t7058>On the grass, they have erected a wooden platform, similar to the one they used to set up every spring for the Diploma Award Ceremony, years ago.</t7058> <t7059>I think about the hats that some of the mothers wore and the black gowns the students put on, and the red ones.</t7059> <t7060>But after all, this platform is not the same; the difference lies in the three wooden posts on top, and the rope loops.</t7060>
<t7061>At the front of the stage, there is a microphone; the television camera is discreetly placed to one side.</t7061>
<t7062>So far, I have only been to one of these events, two years ago.</t7062> <t7063>Women's Salvations are not frequent.</t7063> <t7064>They are not so necessary.</t7064> <t7065>In these times, we behave very well.</t7065>
<t7066>I don't want to tell this story.</t7066>
<t7067>We take our places in the usual order: the Wives and daughters on the wooden folding chairs set up at the back, the Econowives and the Marthas on the sides and on the steps of the library, and the Handmaids at the front, where everyone can keep an eye on us.</t7067> <t7068>We do not sit on chairs but kneel, and this time we have small cushions, made of red velvet, without any inscription, not even the word Faith.</t7068>
<t7069>Fortunately, the weather is good: it's not too hot and the sky is clear.</t7069> <t7070>It would be unfortunate to have to be here on our knees in the rain.</t7070> <t7071>Maybe that's why they announce it so late, to predict what the weather will be like.</t7071> <t7072>It's as good a reason as any.</t7072>
<t7073>I kneel on my red velvet cushion.</t7073> <t7074>I try to think about tonight, about making love in the dark while the light reflects off the white walls.</t7074> <t7075>I remember doing it.</t7075>
<t7076>There is a long piece of rope that sways like a snake in front of the first row of cushions, over the second, and reaches the rows of chairs, curving like a slow river seen from the air.</t7076> <t7077>The rope is thick, brown in color, and smells of tar.</t7077> <t7078>The other end of the rope is on top of the stage.</t7078> <t7079>It looks like a fuse, or the string of a balloon.</t7079>
<t7080>To the left of the stage are those who are going to be saved: two Handmaids and a Wife.</t7080> <t7081>It is not common for there to be Wives, and much to my regret, I look at this one with interest.</t7081>
<t7082>I want to know what he has done.</t7082>
<t7083>They have been placed here before the doors were opened.</t7083> <t7084>They are all sitting on wooden folding chairs, as if they were graduate students about to receive an award.</t7084> <t7085>They have their hands on their laps, as if they were crossed.</t7085> <t7086>They sway a little, probably they have been given injections or pills, so they don't cause trouble.</t7086> <t7087>It's better for things to proceed calmly.</t7087> <t7088>Are they tied to the chairs?</t7088> <t7089>With all the clothes they are wearing, it's impossible to know.</t7089>
<t7090>Now the official entourage approaches the stage and climbs the steps on the right; there are three women: an Aunt who goes ahead and, one step behind, two Guardians dressed in black cloaks and hoods.</t7090> <t7091>Behind them are the other Aunts.</t7091>
<t7092>The murmurs cease.</t7092> <t7093>The three women settle down and turn towards us; the Aunt is flanked by the two Guardians dressed in black.</t7093>
<t7094>It's Aunt Lydia.</t7094> <t7095>How many years had it been since I last saw her?</t7095> <t7096>I had started to think she only existed in my imagination, but here she is, a bit older.</t7096> <t7097>From here I can see her perfectly, I see the deep wrinkles on the sides of her nose, the mark between her eyebrows.</t7097> <t7098>She blinks, smiles nervously, looks attentively to the right and left examining the audience, raises a hand and fiddles with her headdress.</t7098> <t7099>Through the speaker system, a strange and strangled sound reaches us: she is clearing her throat.</t7099>
<t7100>I have started to shiver.</t7100> <t7101>Hatred fills my mouth with saliva.</t7101>
<t7102>The sun rises and the stage and its occupants light up like a nativity scene.</t7102> <t7103>I see the wrinkles under Aunt Lydia's eyes, the pallor of the women who are sitting, the strands of the rope in front of me, the blades of grass.</t7103> <t7104>Directly in front of me is a dandelion the color of an egg yolk.</t7104> <t7105>I am hungry.</t7105> <t7106>The bells stop ringing.</t7106>
<t7107>Aunt Lydia stands up, smooths her skirt with both hands, and approaches the microphone.</t7107>
<t7108>—Good afternoon, ladies —he greets, and the instant and deafening buzz of the speaker system is heard.</t7108>
<t7109>It seems incredible, but among us, some laughter arises.</t7109> <t7110>It's hard not to laugh; it's the tension and Aunt Lydia's irritated expression while adjusting the sound.</t7110> <t7111>This is supposed to be something solemn—.</t7111> <t7112>Good afternoon, ladies —she repeats, this time in a metallic and dull tone.</t7112> <t7113>The fact that she says ladies, instead of girls, is due to the presence of the Wives—.</t7113> <t7114>I'm sure we are all aware of the unfortunate circumstances that bring us together on this beautiful morning, and I have no doubt that we would all prefer to be doing something else, at least that's the case for me; but duty is a true tyrant, perhaps in this case, I should say tyrantess, and it is in the name of duty that we are here today.</t7114>
<t7115>She continues in this tone for a few minutes, but I don't listen to her.</t7115> <t7116>I've heard this speech, or one like it, quite a few times: the same clichés, the same slogans, the same phrases about the torch of the future, the cradle of the race, the duty that awaits us.</t7116> <t7117>It's hard to believe that after this speech there won't be polite applause and tea and pastries won't be served in the garden.</t7117>
<t7118>I think that was the prologue.</t7118> <t7119>Now it will get to the point.</t7119>
<t7120>Aunt Lydia rummages in her pocket and takes out a crumpled piece of paper.</t7120> <t7121>It takes her an excessive amount of time to unfold it and glance at it.</t7121> <t7122>It's as if she's rubbing it in our faces, letting us know exactly who she is, forcing us to watch her as she reads silently, flaunting her prerogatives.</t7122> <t7123>This is an obscenity, I think.</t7123>
<t7124>Let's finish this once and for all.</t7124>
<t7125>—In the past —he says— there was a custom of beginning the Salvations with a detailed report of the crimes for which the prisoners were condemned.</t7125> <t7126>However, we have considered that a public report of this type, especially when it is a televised event, is invariably followed by an outbreak, if I may call it that, almost a wave, I would say, of exactly the same crimes.</t7126> <t7127>So we have decided, for the good of all, to break with this practice.</t7127> <t7128>The Salvations will proceed without further explanations.</t7128>
<t7129>A collective murmur is heard.</t7129> <t7130>The crimes of others are a secret language among us.</t7130> <t7131>Through them, we show each other that, after all, we would be capable of committing them.</t7131> <t7132>It is not a popular statement.</t7132> <t7133>But no one would know by looking at Aunt Lydia, who smiles and blinks, as if overwhelmed by the applause.</t7133> <t7134>Now they let us fend for ourselves, to make our own speculations.</t7134>
<t7135>The first one, the one they are now lifting from her chair, hands with black gloves on the upper part of her arms: for reading?</t7135> <t7136>No, it's just an amputated hand, on the third conviction.</t7136> <t7137>Infidelity, or an attempt on the life of her Commander? Or, more likely, on the life of the Commander's Wife.</t7137> <t7138>That's what we are thinking.</t7138> <t7139>As for the Wife, there is generally only one reason why they might subject her to Salvaging.</t7139> <t7140>They can do almost anything to us, but they are not authorized to kill us, at least not legally.</t7140> <t7141>Not with knitting needles, nor with garden shears, nor with knives stolen from the kitchen, and even less so if we are pregnant.</t7141>
<t7142>It could be adultery, of course.</t7142> <t7143>It could always be that.</t7143>
<t7144>The escape attempt.</t7144>
<t7145>—Decharles —announces Aunt Lydia.</t7145> <t7146>I don't know her.</t7146> <t7147>They make her move forward; she walks as if she is really concentrating on the task, one foot, then the other, there is no doubt that she is drugged.</t7147> <t7148>A lopsided and weak smile forms on her mouth and she contracts one side of her face in an uncoordinated wink directed at the camera.</t7148> <t7149>Of course, they won't show it, this is not live.</t7149> <t7150>The two Guardians tie her hands behind her back.</t7150>
<t7151>Someone behind me is feeling nauseous.</t7151>
<t7152>That's why they don't give us breakfast.</t7152>
<t7153>—It's probably Janine —whispers Deglen.</t7153>
<t7154>I have seen this before, the white bag placed over the head, the woman being helped to climb the high stool as if she were being helped to climb the steps of a bus, held up there, the noose delicately adjusted around her neck like a garment, and then a kick to the stool to knock it away.</t7154> <t7155>I have heard the prolonged sigh that rises around me, a sigh like the air from an inflatable mattress, I have seen Aunt Lydia place her hand over the microphone to muffle the sounds coming from behind her, I have leaned forward to touch along with the other women, with both hands, the rope in front of me, that hairy and sticky rope from tar because of the sun, and then I have placed my hand on my heart to show my unity with the Salvagers, my consent and my complicity in the death of this woman.</t7155> <t7156>I have seen the feet kicking and the two dressed in black grabbing them and pulling down with all their might.</t7156> <t7157>I don't want to see it anymore.</t7157> <t7158>Instead, I look at the grass.</t7158> <t7159>I describe the rope.</t7159>
<t7160>CHAPTER 43</t7160>
<t7161>The three bodies hang there; with the white sacks over their heads, they seem strangely stretched, like chickens hanging by the neck in a butcher's shop window, like birds with clipped wings, like birds incapable of flying, like destroyed angels.</t7161> <t7162>It's hard to take your eyes off them.</t7162> <t7163>The feet dangle below the hems of the dresses, two pairs of red shoes, one pair of blue.</t7163> <t7164>If it weren't for the ropes and the sacks, it could be some kind of dance, a ballet captured in the air by a camera.</t7164> <t7165>They seem to be arranged in order.</t7165> <t7166>As if they were part of a show.</t7166> <t7167>It must have been Aunt Lydia who put the one in blue in the middle.</t7167>
<t7168>—Today's Salvaging is concluded —announces Aunt Lydia through the microphone—.</t7168>
<t7169>But...</t7169>
<t7170>We turn towards her, we listen to her, we observe her.</t7170> <t7171>She always knew where to make the pauses.</t7171> <t7172>A murmur and a movement arise among us.</t7172> <t7173>Perhaps something else is going to happen.</t7173>
<t7174>—But you must get up and form a circle —she smiles at us with a generous and munificent expression.</t7174> <t7175>She is about to give us something.</t7175> <t7176>To grant us something—.</t7176> <t7177>In order.</t7177>
<t7178>He is speaking to us, to the Handmaids.</t7178> <t7179>Some of the Wives start to leave, as well as some of the daughters.</t7179> <t7180>Most of them stay, but in the back, apart, simply watching.</t7180> <t7181>They are not part of the circle.</t7181>
<t7182>Two Guardians have advanced and are winding up the thick rope, removing it from the way.</t7182> <t7183>Others are removing the cushions.</t7183> <t7184>We huddle on the grass, in front of the stage, some of us try to find a spot at the front, near the center, a few push hard enough to make their way to the center, where they will be protected.</t7184> <t7185>It's a mistake to hesitate too much in a group like this; they label you as an unenthusiastic person lacking zeal.</t7185> <t7186>Here, there is a display of energy, a murmur, a shiver of speed and fury.</t7186> <t7187>Bodies tense, eyes become brighter, as if aiming at something.</t7187>
<t7188>I don't want to be in front, nor behind.</t7188> <t7189>I'm not sure what will happen, although I sense it will be something I don't want to see up close.</t7189> <t7190>But Deglen grabs me by the arm and drags me along; we position ourselves in the second line, barely protected by a thin row of bodies.</t7190> <t7191>I don't want to see but I don't retreat either.</t7191> <t7192>I've heard rumors, but I only half believe them.</t7192> <t7193>Despite everything I know, I tell myself: they won't go to that extreme.</t7193>
<t7194>—You know the rules of a Particicution —says Aunt Lydia—.</t7194> <t7195>You will wait until I blow the whistle.</t7195> <t7196>After that, what you do is your business, until I blow the whistle again.</t7196> <t7197>Understood?</t7197>
<t7198>A general murmur arises, a shapeless assent.</t7198>
<t7199>—Well then —says Aunt Lydia.</t7199> <t7200>She nods her head and two Guardians, who are not the ones who removed the rope, approach from behind the stage.</t7200> <t7201>Between the two of them, they almost drag another man.</t7201> <t7202>This one is also dressed in a Guardian's uniform, but he is not wearing the cap and his uniform is dirty and torn.</t7202> <t7203>His face is cut and bruised, and full of reddish-purple welts; it is swollen and lumpy, and his beard is beginning to grow.</t7203> <t7204>It doesn't look like a face, but some unknown vegetable, a shattered bulb or a tuber, something deformed.</t7204> <t7205>Even from where I am, I can smell him: he smells of shit and vomit.</t7205> <t7206>Some strands of blond hair fall over his face, as if something had made them stand on end.</t7206> <t7207>Could it be dried sweat?</t7207>
<t7208>I stare at him fixedly, with disgust.</t7208> <t7209>He looks drunk.</t7209> <t7210>He looks like a drunk who has been in a fight.</t7210> <t7211>Why would they have brought a drunk here?</t7211>
<t7212>—This man —Aunt Lydia clarifies— has been convicted of rape —her voice trembles with anger and reveals a triumphant tone—.</t7212> <t7213>He was a Guardian.</t7213>
<t7214>He dishonored his uniform.</t7214> <t7215>He abused his position of trust.</t7215> <t7216>His accomplice has already been executed.</t7216> <t7217>As you know, rape is punished by death.</t7217> <t7218>Deuteronomy, twenty-two; verses twenty-three and twenty-nine.</t7218> <t7219>I must add that this crime involved two of you and was carried out at gunpoint.</t7219> <t7220>And it was brutal.</t7220> <t7221>I will not offend your ears with more details, except to say that one woman was pregnant and the baby died.</t7221>
<t7222>A moan is heard among us; despite myself, I clasp my hands.</t7222> <t7223>This violation is excessive.</t7223> <t7224>The baby too, after all that we endure.</t7224> <t7225>It's true, there is a craving for blood; I feel the urge to break, to tear, to destroy.</t7225>
<t7226>We push forward, our heads turning from side to side, our nostrils flaring as we sniff out death, we look at each other to see our hatred.</t7226> <t7227>He deserved something worse than death.</t7227> <t7228>The man turns his head, dazed.</t7228> <t7229>Did he even hear it?</t7229>
<t7230>Aunt Lydia waits a moment; then she smiles slightly and brings the whistle to her lips.</t7230> <t7231>We hear it, shrill and pristine, an echo from a volleyball game of bygone times.</t7231>
<t7232>The two Guardians release the arms of the third man and step back.</t7232> <t7233>The man staggers —is he drugged?— and falls to his knees.</t7233> <t7234>His eyes are squinted in the swollen flesh, as if the light is too bright for him.</t7234> <t7235>They have kept him locked up in the darkness.</t7235> <t7236>He brings a hand to his cheek, as if to check if it is still there.</t7236> <t7237>All this happens quickly, but it seems slow.</t7237>
<t7238>Nobody moves.</t7238> <t7239>The women look at him with horror, as if he were a half-dead rat crawling across the kitchen floor.</t7239> <t7240>He looks at us with squinted eyes, observing the circle of red women.</t7240> <t7241>Incredibly, one side of his mouth lifts... could it be a smile?</t7241>
<t7242>I try to penetrate it with my gaze, to see inside the shattered face, to find out what his real appearance must be.</t7242> <t7243>I suppose he is around thirty years old.</t7243> <t7244>He is not Luke.</t7244>
<t7245>But I know it could have been him.</t7245> <t7246>It could be Nick.</t7246> <t7247>I know that, regardless of what he has done, I cannot touch him.</t7247>
<t7248>He says something.</t7248> <t7249>His words are unclear, as if his throat were bruised, as if his tongue were too large, but I hear him anyway.</t7249> <t7250>He says:</t7250>
<t7251>—I don't...</t7251>
<t7252>A movement occurs forward, as if we were a crowd at a rock concert from another time and we were waiting for the doors to open with that urgency that takes hold of us.</t7252> <t7253>The air is filled with adrenaline, everything is allowed to us, this is freedom, I feel it in my body, I feel vertigo, a red stain spreads everywhere, but before the tide of clothes and bodies starts to hit him, Deglen makes her way through the women, elbowing left and right and runs towards him.</t7253> <t7254>She makes him fall sideways and furiously kicks his head, once, twice, three times, with dry and precise blows.</t7254> <t7255>Now there are groans, a weak sound similar to a growl, screams, and the red bodies fall forward and I can no longer see anything, he has been hidden by arms, fists, and feet.</t7255> <t7256>Somewhere a howl is heard, like the terrified cry of a horse.</t7256>
<t7257>I stay at a certain distance, trying to keep my balance.</t7257> <t7258>Something hits me from behind and I stagger.</t7258> <t7259>When I regain my balance, I look around and see the Wives and daughters leaning forward in their chairs, and the Aunts watching with interest from the platform.</t7259> <t7260>From up there, they must have a better perspective.</t7260>
<t7261>He has become that.</t7261>
<t7262>Deglen is once again by my side.</t7262> <t7263>His face is tense and expressionless.</t7263>
<t7264>—I saw what you did —I tell him.</t7264> <t7265>I start to feel shock, outrage, nausea again.</t7265> <t7266>Barbarism—.</t7266> <t7267>Why did you do it?</t7267> <t7268>Precisely you!</t7268> <t7269>I thought that...</t7269>
<t7270>—Don't look at me —he warns me—.</t7270> <t7271>They are watching us.</t7271>
<t7272>—I don't care —I reply.</t7272> <t7273>I'm raising my voice.</t7273> <t7274>I can't help it.</t7274>
<t7275>—Control yourself —he advises me.</t7275> <t7276>He pretends to push me away by grabbing my arm and shoulder and brings his face close to my ear—.</t7276> <t7277>Don't be stupid.</t7277> <t7278>He wasn't a rapist, he was a politician.</t7278>
<t7279>He was one of ours.</t7279> <t7280>I left him unconscious.</t7280> <t7281>I spared him the pain.</t7281> <t7282>Don't you see what they are doing to him?</t7282>
<t7283>One of ours, I think.</t7283> <t7284>A Guardian.</t7284> <t7285>It seems impossible.</t7285>
<t7286>Aunt Lydia blows the whistle again, but the women do not stop immediately.</t7286>
<t7287>The two Guardians intervene to separate them from what remains of the man.</t7287> <t7288>Some lie on the grass as they have been hit or kicked by mistake.</t7288> <t7289>Others have fainted.</t7289> <t7290>The rest scatter in pairs, threes, or alone.</t7290> <t7291>They seem dazed.</t7291>
<t7292>—Find your partner and form a line —orders Aunt Lydia through the microphone.</t7292>
<t7293>A few obey her.</t7293> <t7294>A woman approaches us, walking as if groping in the dark: it is Janine.</t7294> <t7295>She has a bloodstain on her face and some more on the white part of her headdress.</t7295> <t7296>She gives us a tiny smile.</t7296> <t7297>Her gaze is lost.</t7297>
<t7298>—Hello —he greets—.</t7298> <t7299>How are you? —he holds something with his right hand.</t7299> <t7300>It's a lock of blonde hair.</t7300> <t7301>He laughs foolishly.</t7301>
<t7302>—Janine —I say to her.</t7302> <t7303>But now she lets herself go completely, as if in free fall, in an attitude of abandonment.</t7303>
<t7304>—Have a good time —she says and walks past us, heading towards the entrance.</t7304>
<t7305>I watch her.</t7305> <t7306>Be careful, I think.</t7306> <t7307>I don't even feel sorry for her, although I should.</t7307> <t7308>I feel rage.</t7308> <t7309>I'm not proud of it, nor of any of this.</t7309> <t7310>But that's what matters.</t7310>
<t7311>My hands smell like hot tar.</t7311> <t7312>I want to go back home and go up to the bathroom and scrub myself over and over again with the hard soap and pumice stone to remove any trace of this smell from my skin that makes me feel sick.</t7312>
<t7313>And I am also hungry.</t7313> <t7314>It seems monstrous, but nevertheless it is true.</t7314> <t7315>Death makes me feel hungry.</t7315> <t7316>Maybe it's because I have been left empty; or maybe it's my body's way of proving that I am alive, and I keep repeating like a prayer: I am, I am.</t7316> <t7317>I am still here.</t7317>
<t7318>I want to go to bed and make love, right now.</t7318>
<t7319>I think about the word fruition.</t7319>
<t7320>I could eat a horse.</t7320>
<t7321>CHAPTER 44</t7321>
<t7322>Things have returned to normal.</t7322>
<t7323>How can I call this normality?</t7323> <t7324>Although compared to this morning, it is normal.</t7324>
<t7325>For lunch, they gave me a sandwich with brown bread and cheese, a glass of milk, some celery stalks, and canned pears.</t7325> <t7326>A school lunch.</t7326> <t7327>I ate it all, not very quickly, but savoring the abundance of flavors with my tongue.</t7327> <t7328>Now I will go shopping, as usual.</t7328> <t7329>I almost look forward to that moment eagerly.</t7329> <t7330>In a way, it is a comfort to break the routine.</t7330>
<t7331>I go out the back door and walk along the path.</t7331> <t7332>Nick is washing the car and wearing his cap sideways.</t7332> <t7333>He doesn't look at me.</t7333> <t7334>Now we try not to look at each other.</t7334>
<t7335>Surely we would be discovered, even here in the open air, where no one sees us.</t7335>
<t7336>I stop at the corner to wait for Deglen.</t7336> <t7337>She is running late.</t7337> <t7338>Finally, I see her coming, a silhouette of red and white clothing, like a kite, walking with a steady pace, just as we have been taught.</t7338> <t7339>I see her and at first, I don't notice anything.</t7339> <t7340>But as she gets closer, I realize that something is not right.</t7340> <t7341>She looks strange.</t7341> <t7342>She has changed in an undefined way; she is not hurt nor limping.</t7342> <t7343>It's as if she had shrunk.</t7343>
<t7344>When I have her closer, I realize.</t7344> <t7345>It's not Deglen.</t7345> <t7346>She has the same height, but she is thinner, and her face is beige instead of pink.</t7346> <t7347>She approaches me and stops.</t7347>
<t7348>—Blessed be the fruit —she greets me.</t7348> <t7349>Unflappable.</t7349> <t7350>Sanctimonious.</t7350>
<t7351>—And may the Lord allow it to open —I replied.</t7351> <t7352>I try not to reveal my astonishment.</t7352>
<t7353>—You must be Offred —he says to me.</t7353> <t7354>I respond affirmatively and we start walking.</t7354>
<t7355>And now?, I think.</t7355> <t7356>My head is spinning, this doesn't mean anything good, what could have happened to her, how to find out without showing too much of my concern?</t7356> <t7357>We cannot create friendships or loyalties among us.</t7357> <t7358>I try to remember how long Deglen had to stay in her current assignment.</t7358>
<t7359>—We have very good weather —I commented.</t7359>
<t7360>—What fills me with joy —it is a calm, monotonous, expressionless voice.</t7360>
<t7361>We passed through the first checkpoint without saying anything more.</t7361> <t7362>She appears taciturn, but so do I.</t7362> <t7363>Is she waiting for me to start talking, to reveal myself, or is she a believer absorbed in meditation?</t7363>
<t7364>—Has Deglen been transferred?</t7364> <t7365>So soon? —I ask, knowing she hasn't been transferred.</t7365> <t7366>I saw her this morning.</t7366> <t7367>She would have told me.</t7367>
<t7368>—I am Deglen —the woman replies.</t7368> <t7369>I know it perfectly well.</t7369> <t7370>Of course she is, she's the new one; and Deglen, wherever she is, is no longer Deglen.</t7370> <t7371>I never knew her real name.</t7371> <t7372>This is how you can lose yourself in a sea of names.</t7372> <t7373>Now it wouldn't be easy to find her.</t7373>
<t7374>We go to Milk and Honey, and to All Meat, where I buy a chicken and the new Deglen gets a kilo of hamburgers.</t7374> <t7375>There's a line, as usual.</t7375> <t7376>I see several women I recognize and exchange with them the infinitesimal nods with which we mutually show that we know each other, at least to someone, that we still exist.</t7376> <t7377>When we leave All Meat, I say to the new Deglen:</t7377>
<t7378>—We should go to the Wall —I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this; maybe to find a way to test her reaction.</t7378> <t7379>I need to know if she is one of us or not.</t7379>
<t7380>If it is, if I can prove it, maybe she can tell me what really happened to Deglen.</t7380>
<t7381>—As you wish —he/she accepts.</t7381> <t7382>Is it indifference or caution?</t7382>
<t7383>On the Wall hang the three women from this morning, still wearing their dresses and with white bags on their heads.</t7383> <t7384>Their arms have been untied, now hanging stiffly at the sides of their bodies.</t7384> <t7385>The one in blue is in the middle and the two in red are on the sides, but the colors are no longer so bright; they seem to have faded, dulled, like dead butterflies or like a tropical fish that starts to dry out on the sand.</t7385> <t7386>They have lost their shine.</t7386> <t7387>We observe them in silence.</t7387>
<t7388>—Let this serve as a warning to us —pronounces the new Deglen finally.</t7388>
<t7389>At first, I say nothing because I try to decipher what she means.</t7389> <t7390>She could mean that it is a warning about the injustice and brutality of the regime.</t7390> <t7391>In that case, I would have to answer yes.</t7391> <t7392>Or she could mean the opposite, that we should do what we are told and not get into trouble, because if we don't, we will receive just punishment.</t7392> <t7393>If she means this, I should answer "praised be".</t7393> <t7394>But her voice was soft, expressionless, it did not provide me with any clues.</t7394>
<t7395>I take the risk and respond to him:</t7395>
<t7396>—Yes.</t7396>
<t7397>She doesn't answer me, but I perceive a white flash, as if she had quickly turned to look at me.</t7397>
<t7398>A moment later, we set out on the long journey back, coordinating our steps as established so that it appears we are acting in unison.</t7398>
<t7399>I think that maybe it would be better to wait before making a new attempt.</t7399> <t7400>It is too soon to insist, to probe.</t7400> <t7401>I should wait a week, two weeks maybe more and observe her closely, listen to the tones of her voice, the imprudent words, just as Deglen listened to me.</t7401> <t7402>Now that Deglen is gone, I am alert again, my laziness has disappeared, my body no longer just experiences pleasure, but I perceive the danger it entails.</t7402> <t7403>I must not rush or take unnecessary risks.</t7403> <t7404>But I need to know.</t7404> <t7405>I hold myself back until we pass the last checkpoint, only a few blocks remain, and then I lose my temper.</t7405>
<t7406>—I didn't know Deglen very well —I comment—.</t7406> <t7407>I mean the first one.</t7407>
<t7408>—No? —he asks.</t7408> <t7409>The fact that he has responded, albeit cautiously, encourages me.</t7409>
<t7410>—I've only known her since May —I continued.</t7410> <t7411>I feel my skin burning and my heart racing.</t7411> <t7412>This is delicate.</t7412> <t7413>On one hand, it is a lie.</t7413> <t7414>And now how do I get to the vital word?—.</t7414> <t7415>I think it was around the first of May.</t7415>
<t7416>What they used to call May Day.</t7416>
<t7417>—Oh, really? —he responds in a weak, indifferent, threatening tone—.</t7417> <t7418>I don't remember that expression.</t7418> <t7419>I'm surprised you remember it.</t7419> <t7420>You should make an effort... —he pauses— ... to eliminate such... —another pause— ... resonances from your mind.</t7420>
<t7421>I feel the cold springing up on my skin as if it were water.</t7421> <t7422>What he says is a warning.</t7422>
<t7423>She is not one of ours.</t7423> <t7424>But she knows.</t7424>
<t7425>I walk the last blocks dominated by terror.</t7425> <t7426>Once again, I have acted like a fool.</t7426> <t7427>More than a fool.</t7427> <t7428>It didn't occur to me before, but now I realize: if Deglen has been discovered, she might talk about other people and also about me.</t7428> <t7429>And she will talk.</t7429> <t7430>She won't be able to avoid it.</t7430>
<t7431>But in reality, I haven't done anything, I tell myself.</t7431> <t7432>All I have done is know.</t7432> <t7433>All I have done is not speak.</t7433>
<t7434>They know where my little one is.</t7434> <t7435>And if they bring her and threaten her in my presence?</t7435> <t7436>And if they do something to her?</t7436> <t7437>I can't bear to think what they could do to her. Or Luke, what if they have Luke?</t7437> <t7438>Or my mother, or Moira, or anyone.</t7438> <t7439>My God, don't make me choose.</t7439> <t7440>I know I couldn't bear it; Moira was right about me.</t7440> <t7441>I'll say whatever they want, I'll betray anyone.</t7441> <t7442>It's true, at the first scream, even at the first moan, I'll be shattered, I'll confess to any crime and end up hanging from a hook on the Wall.</t7442> <t7443>Keep your head down, I used to tell myself, and understand it.</t7443> <t7444>It doesn't make sense.</t7444>
<t7445>This is what I tell myself as we return home.</t7445>
<t7446>Upon reaching the corner, we positioned ourselves face to face, as usual.</t7446>
<t7447>—May His Gaze accompany you —says the new and treacherous Deglen in farewell.</t7447>
<t7448>—May His Gaze accompany you —I respond, trying to appear devout.</t7448> <t7449>As if, now that we've reached this point, this comedy would serve any purpose.</t7449>
<t7450>Then he does something strange.</t7450> <t7451>He leans forward —in such a way that the rigid blinders on our heads are about to touch and I can see up close the pale beige color of his eyes, and the delicate network of lines that crisscross his cheeks— and whispers very quickly and in a muted tone, as if his voice were a dry leaf:</t7451>
<t7452>—She hanged herself.</t7452> <t7453>After the Salvage.</t7453> <t7454>She saw the van coming to take her away.</t7454>
<t7455>It's better this way.</t7455>
<t7456>And he walks away from me, down the street.</t7456>
<t7457>CHAPTER 45</t7457>
<t7458>Wait a moment; I'm out of breath, as if I had been kicked.</t7458>
<t7459>Then she is dead and I am safe.</t7459> <t7460>She did it before they arrived.</t7460>
<t7461>I feel an enormous relief.</t7461> <t7462>I am grateful to him/her.</t7462> <t7463>He/She has died so that I can live.</t7463> <t7464>I will regret it.</t7464>
<t7465>Unless this woman is lying.</t7465> <t7466>The possibility always exists.</t7466>
<t7467>I breathe deeply and release the air, providing oxygen.</t7467> <t7468>Everything darkens and then clears up.</t7468> <t7469>Now I see where I'm walking.</t7469>
<t7470>I turn, open the door, leave my hand resting for a moment to calm myself, and enter.</t7470> <t7471>There is Nick, still washing the car, and whistling.</t7471> <t7472>I have the feeling that he is very far away.</t7472>
<t7473>My God, I think, I will do whatever you want.</t7473> <t7474>Now that you have forgiven me, I will destroy myself if that is what you truly desire; I will truly empty myself, I will become a chalice.</t7474>
<t7475>I will give up Nick, I will forget about the others, I will stop lamenting.</t7475> <t7476>I will accept my fate.</t7476> <t7477>I will sacrifice myself.</t7477> <t7478>I will repent.</t7478> <t7479>I will abdicate.</t7479> <t7480>I will renounce.</t7480>
<t7481>I know this isn't fair, but I think it anyway.</t7481> <t7482>Everything they taught us at the Red Center, everything I have resisted comes back to me like a torrent.</t7482>
<t7483>I don't want to feel pain, I don't want to be a dancer nor have my feet in the air and my head turned into a faceless white rectangle of cloth.</t7483> <t7484>I don't want to be a doll hanging from the Wall, I don't want to be an angel without wings.</t7484> <t7485>I want to keep living, no matter what.</t7485> <t7486>I freely give my body for others to use.</t7486> <t7487>They can do whatever they want with me.</t7487> <t7488>I am an object.</t7488>
<t7489>For the first time, I feel the true power that they have.</t7489>
<t7490>I walk past the flower beds and the willow tree, heading towards the back door.</t7490>
<t7491>I will enter, I will be safe.</t7491> <t7492>I will fall to my knees in my room, and I will breathe gratefully, filling my lungs with the stale air and smelling the scent of polished furniture.</t7492>
<t7493>Serena Joy is waiting on the front door steps.</t7493> <t7494>She calls me.</t7494> <t7495>What does she want?</t7495> <t7496>Does she want me to go to the living room and help her wind the gray wool?</t7496> <t7497>I won't be able to keep my hands steady, she will notice something.</t7497> <t7498>But anyway, I approach her, I have no other choice.</t7498>
<t7499>He stands before me, on the last step.</t7499> <t7500>His eyes shine, a vivid blue in contrast with the white of his wrinkled skin.</t7500> <t7501>I look away from his face and gaze at the ground; next to his feet, I see the tip of the cane.</t7501>
<t7502>—I trusted you —he tells me—.</t7502> <t7503>I tried to help you.</t7503>
<t7504>I still don't look at her.</t7504> <t7505>A feeling of guilt overwhelms me.</t7505> <t7506>They have discovered me, but what have they discovered?</t7506> <t7507>Which of my many sins am I being accused of?</t7507>
<t7508>The only way to find out is to remain silent.</t7508> <t7509>Starting to make excuses now for this or that would be a mistake.</t7509> <t7510>I might reveal something that she doesn't even imagine.</t7510>
<t7511>It might not be anything important.</t7511> <t7512>It might be about the match I hid in the mattress.</t7512> <t7513>I lower my head.</t7513>
<t7514>—Well? —he urges me—.</t7514> <t7515>Don't you have anything to say?</t7515>
<t7516>I look at her.</t7516>
<t7517>—About what? —I manage to stammer.</t7517> <t7518>As soon as I say it, it seems insolent to me.</t7518>
<t7519>—Look —he indicates to me.</t7519> <t7520>He removes his hand from behind his back.</t7520> <t7521>What he is holding is his cloak, the winter one—.</t7521> <t7522>It was stained with lipstick —he says—.</t7522> <t7523>How could you be so vulgar?</t7523> <t7524>I told him... —he lets the cloak fall and I see that there is something else in his bony hand.</t7524> <t7525>He also throws it to the ground.</t7525> <t7526>The purple sequins slide down the steps like snake skin, glistening under the sunlight.</t7526>
<t7527>—.</t7527> <t7528>Behind my back —he continues—.</t7528> <t7529>You could have left me something —so does he love her?</t7529>
<t7530>Raise the cane.</t7530> <t7531>I think he's going to hit me, but he doesn't—.</t7531> <t7532>Pick up this trash and go to your room.</t7532> <t7533>Exactly the same as the other one.</t7533> <t7534>A bitch.</t7534> <t7535>And you'll end up the same way.</t7535>
<t7536>I bend down and pick it up.</t7536> <t7537>Nick, who is behind me, has stopped whistling.</t7537>
<t7538>I want to turn around, run towards him, and hug him.</t7538> <t7539>But it would be foolish.</t7539> <t7540>He can't do anything to help me.</t7540> <t7541>He would fall with me.</t7541>
<t7542>I walk towards the back door, enter the kitchen, leave the basket, and go up the stairs.</t7542> <t7543>I am calm.</t7543>
<t7544>XV</t7544>
<t7545>THE NIGHT</t7545>
<t7546>CHAPTER 46</t7546>
<t7547>I sit in my room, next to the window, and wait.</t7547> <t7548>In my lap, I have a handful of crushed stars.</t7548>
<t7549>This could be the last time I have to wait.</t7549> <t7550>But I don't know what I'm waiting for.</t7550> <t7551>What are you waiting for?, it used to be said.</t7551> <t7552>Which meant Hurry up.</t7552> <t7553>An answer was not expected.</t7553> <t7554>What are you waiting for is a different question, and for this one, I also have no answer.</t7554>
<t7555>Although it is not exactly waiting.</t7555> <t7556>It is more like a form of suspension.</t7556> <t7557>Without suspending anything.</t7557> <t7558>There is no time.</t7558>
<t7559>I have fallen from grace, which is the opposite of grace.</t7559> <t7560>Because of this, I should feel worse.</t7560>
<t7561>But I feel calm, at peace, imbued with indifference.</t7561> <t7562>Don't let the bastards burn you out. I repeat it to myself, but it doesn't mean anything to me.</t7562>
<t7563>One could also say Don't let the air pass; or No.</t7563>
<t7564>I suppose you could say that.</t7564>
<t7565>There is no one in the garden.</t7565> <t7566>I wonder if it will rain.</t7566>
<t7567>Outside, the day begins to fade.</t7567> <t7568>The sky is already reddish.</t7568> <t7569>Soon it will be dark.</t7569>
<t7570>It's already darker.</t7570> <t7571>It didn't take much time.</t7571>
<t7572>There are a lot of things I could do.</t7572> <t7573>For example, I could set the house on fire.</t7573> <t7574>I could make a bundle with some of my clothes and the sheets and light the match I have saved.</t7574> <t7575>If it didn't catch fire, nothing would happen.</t7575> <t7576>But if it did catch fire, at least there would be some kind of signal marking my departure.</t7576> <t7577>A few flames that would easily go out.</t7577> <t7578>In the meantime, I could let out some clouds of smoke and die of suffocation.</t7578>
<t7579>I could tear the sheet into strips, twist them like a rope, tie one end to the leg of my bed, and try to break the window glass.</t7579> <t7580>Which is shatterproof.</t7580>
<t7581>I could turn to the Commander, throw myself on the ground completely disheveled, cling to his knees, confess, cry, implore.</t7581> <t7582>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum, I could say.</t7582> <t7583>Not as a prayer.</t7583> <t7584>I see his shoes, black, polished, impenetrable, keeping silent.</t7584>
<t7585>I could also tie the sheet around my neck, hang myself from the wardrobe, let my body fall forward, and strangle myself.</t7585>
<t7586>I could hide behind the door, wait for her to come limping down the hallway bringing some sentence, a penance, a punishment, pounce on her, knock her down, and kick her head with a swift and precise blow.</t7586> <t7587>To spare her the pain, just like me.</t7587> <t7588>To spare her our pain.</t7588>
<t7589>That way, he would gain time.</t7589>
<t7590>I could go down the stairs with a steady step, exit through the front door to the street, trying to give the impression that I know where I'm going, and see how far I can get.</t7590> <t7591>Red is a very visible color.</t7591>
<t7592>I could go to Nick's room, above the garage, as I have done until now.</t7592>
<t7593>I could wonder if he would let me in or not, if he would give me shelter.</t7593> <t7594>Now that it is really necessary.</t7594>
<t7595>I think about all this absentmindedly.</t7595> <t7596>Each of the possibilities seems as important as the rest.</t7596> <t7597>None seems preferable to another.</t7597> <t7598>Fatigue takes hold of me, my body, my legs, and my eyes.</t7598> <t7599>This is what happens in the end.</t7599> <t7600>Faith is nothing more than an embroidered word.</t7600>
<t7601>I look at the sunset and imagine that we are in winter.</t7601> <t7602>The snow falls gently, easily, covering everything with soft crystals, the fog that covers the moon before it rains, blurring the outlines, erasing the colors.</t7602> <t7603>They say that death by freezing is painless.</t7603> <t7604>You lie down on the snow like an angel made by some children and fall asleep.</t7604>
<t7605>I feel her presence behind me, that of my ancestor, my double, who appears suspended in the air, beneath the chandelier, with her dress of stars and feathers like a bird halted in mid-flight, a woman turned into an angel, waiting to be found.</t7605> <t7606>This time by me.</t7606> <t7607>How could I believe that I was alone?</t7607> <t7608>We were always two.</t7608> <t7609>End it once and for all, she tells me.</t7609> <t7610>I am tired of this melodrama, I am tired of keeping silent.</t7610> <t7611>There is no one you can protect, your life has no value to anyone.</t7611> <t7612>I want this to end.</t7612>
<t7613>As I get up, I hear the black van.</t7613> <t7614>I hear it before I see it; it emerges from its own sound mixed with the twilight, like a solidification, a clot of the night.</t7614> <t7615>It turns into the driveway and stops.</t7615> <t7616>I barely make out the white eye and the two wings.</t7616> <t7617>The paint must be phosphorescent.</t7617> <t7618>Two men detach from it as if from a mold, climb the entrance steps, ring the doorbell.</t7618> <t7619>I hear the sound of the doorbell, ding-dong, like the ghost of a cosmetics saleswoman.</t7619>
<t7620>Now comes the worst.</t7620>
<t7621>I have been wasting time.</t7621> <t7622>I should have taken care of it when I still had the chance to do so.</t7622> <t7623>I should have stolen a knife from the kitchen, found a way to get the scissors from the sewing kit.</t7623> <t7624>There were also the garden shears, the knitting needles.</t7624> <t7625>The world is full of weapons if one looks for them.</t7625> <t7626>I should have paid attention.</t7626>
<t7627>But now it is too late to think about that, their footsteps already sound on the ash-pink carpet of the stairs; the mute and heavy steps resound in my forehead; I am with my back to the window.</t7627>
<t7628>I hope to see a stranger, but it is Nick who suddenly opens the door and turns on the light.</t7628> <t7629>I don't understand, unless he is one of them.</t7629> <t7630>That possibility always existed.</t7630> <t7631>Nick, the secret Eye.</t7631> <t7632>Dirty work is done by dirty people.</t7632>
<t7633>You are a piece of shit, I think.</t7633> <t7634>I open my mouth to say it, but he comes closer to me and whispers:</t7634>
<t7635>—Everything is fine.</t7635> <t7636>It's Mayday.</t7636> <t7637>Go with them —he calls me by my real name.</t7637> <t7638>Why would this mean anything?</t7638>
<t7639>—Them? —I ask him.</t7639> <t7640>I see the two men standing behind him; the hallway light turns their heads into skulls—.</t7640> <t7641>You must be crazy —my suspicion hangs in the air, a dark angel sends me a warning.</t7641> <t7642>I can almost see it.</t7642> <t7643>Why wouldn't he know about Mayday?</t7643> <t7644>All the Eyes must know; it has been squeezed, wrung, and drained from too many bodies, from too many mouths.</t7644>
<t7645>—Trust me —he insists; although that was never a talisman, it does not represent any guarantee.</t7645>
<t7646>But I cling to this offer.</t7646> <t7647>It's all I have left.</t7647>
<t7648>They escort me down the stairs, one in front and one behind.</t7648> <t7649>We move at a slow pace; the lights are on.</t7649> <t7650>Despite the fear, everything seems normal to me.</t7650>
<t7651>From where I am, I can see the clock. It's not any particular time.</t7651>
<t7652>Nick is no longer with us.</t7652> <t7653>He must have gone down the back stairs so that no one would see him.</t7653>
<t7654>Serena Joy is in the hallway, beneath the mirror, watching us with an incredulous look.</t7654> <t7655>Behind her, next to the open door of the living room, is the Commander.</t7655>
<t7656>His hair is very gray.</t7656> <t7657>He looks worried and powerless, but he is starting to pull away from me, to distance himself.</t7657> <t7658>Apart from what it meant to him, we have reached a point where I also represent a failure.</t7658> <t7659>They have undoubtedly argued about me; she has undoubtedly given him a hard time.</t7659> <t7660>I'm still having a hard time, I can't feel sorry for him.</t7660> <t7661>Moira is right, I am a prude.</t7661>
<t7662>—What has she done? —asks Serena Joy.</t7662> <t7663>So it wasn't her who called them.</t7663>
<t7664>I don't know what was in store for me, but it was something more private.</t7664>
<t7665>—We can't say, ma'am —says the one in front of me—.</t7665> <t7666>I'm sorry.</t7666>
<t7667>—I want to see the authorization —says the Commander—.</t7667> <t7668>Do you have legal authorization?</t7668>
<t7669>Now I could start screaming, grab onto the railing, give up all dignity.</t7669> <t7670>I could stop them, at least for a moment.</t7670> <t7671>If they are the real ones, they will stay, otherwise they will run away.</t7671> <t7672>And they will leave me here.</t7672>
<t7673>—We don't need it, sir, but everything is in order —says the same man—.</t7673>
<t7674>Violation of state secrets.</t7674>
<t7675>The Commander puts a hand to his head.</t7675> <t7676>What have I been saying, and to whom, and which of his enemies has discovered it?</t7676> <t7677>His security is probably in danger now.</t7677> <t7678>I am above him, looking at him; and he is shrinking.</t7678> <t7679>There have already been purges among them, and there will be more.</t7679> <t7680>Serena Joy turns pale.</t7680>
<t7681>—Slut —he insults me—.</t7681> <t7682>After everything he did for you.</t7682>
<t7683>Cora and Rita come running from the kitchen.</t7683> <t7684>Cora is in tears.</t7684> <t7685>I was her hope, and I have let her down.</t7685> <t7686>She will never have children.</t7686>
<t7687>The van waits in the driveway, with the double doors open.</t7687> <t7688>The two men—now one on each side—grab me by the arms and help me up.</t7688> <t7689>I have no way of knowing if this is my end or a new beginning: I have surrendered to strangers because it is inevitable.</t7689>
<t7690>I ascend and penetrate into the darkness within; or into the light.</t7690>
<t7691>HISTORICAL NOTES</t7691>
<t7692>HISTORICAL NOTES ABOUT THE STORY</t7692>
<t7693>OF THE MAID</t7693>
<t7694>Partial transcription of the minutes of the Twelfth Symposium on Gileadean Studies, held as part of the International Historical Association Congress that took place at the University of Denay, Nunavit, on June 25, 2191.</t7694>
<t7695>President: Professor Maryann Crescent Moon (Maryann Luna Creciente) from the Department of Caucasian Anthropology at the University of Denay, Nunav it.</t7695>
<t7696>Inaugural Speaker: Professor James Darcy Pieixoto, Director of the Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Archives, University of Cambridge, England.</t7696>
<t7697>CRESCENT MOON:</t7697>
<t7698>I am delighted to welcome you all, and pleased to see that many of you are attending the undoubtedly fascinating and beneficial lecture by Professor Pieixoto.</t7698> <t7699>The members of the Gileadean Research Association believe that this period deserves more thorough study, as it was responsible for altering the world map, especially in this hemisphere.</t7699>
<t7700>But before moving on to that, I would like to make some announcements.</t7700> <t7701>The fishing expedition will depart tomorrow, as scheduled, and for those who have not brought adequate rain gear and insect repellent, I inform you that you can obtain them charged to your account at the reception.</t7701> <t7702>The Nature Walk and the Outdoor Historical Costume Parade have been postponed to the day after tomorrow since our infallible Professor Johnny Running Dog has informed us that there will be a change in the weather by then.</t7702>
<t7703>Allow me to remind you of the rest of the activities sponsored by the Gileadian Research Association that you can participate in during this congress as part of the programming for this Twelfth Symposium.</t7703> <t7704>Tomorrow afternoon, Professor Gopal Chatterjee, from the Department of Western Philosophy at the University of Baroda in India, will lecture on "The Krishna and Kali Elements in the State Religion of the Early Gileadian Period," and on Thursday morning, Professor Sieglinda Van Buren, from the Department of Military History at the University of San Antonio, Republic of Texas, will speak.</t7704> <t7705>Professor Van Buren will offer what will undoubtedly be a fascinating illustrated lecture on "The Warsaw Tactic: The Urban Core Encirclement Policy in the Gileadian Civil Wars."</t7705> <t7706>I am sure we will all want to attend.</t7706>
<t7707>I must also remind our keynote speaker, although I am sure it is not necessary, to stick to the time that has been assigned to him, because we want to dedicate a part to questions, and I suppose no one will want to miss lunch, as happened yesterday.</t7707> <t7708>(Laughter.)</t7708>
<t7709>Professor Pieixoto practically needs no introduction as he is well known to all of us, if not personally, at least through his numerous publications.</t7709> <t7710>Among them are "Sumptuary Laws Through the Ages: An Analysis of Documents," and the well-known study "Iran and Gilead: Two Late Twentieth-Century Monotheocracies Seen Through Diaries."</t7710> <t7711>As you all know, he is the co-director, along with Professor Knotly Wade (Knotted Duck), also from Cambridge, of the manuscript we are discussing today and collaborated in its transcription, commentary, and publication.</t7711> <t7712>The title of this talk is "Authentication Issues Related to The Handmaid's Tale."</t7712>
<t7713>Professor Pieixoto.</t7713>
<t7714>(Applause.)</t7714>
<t7715>PIEIXOTO:</t7715> PIEIXOTO:
<t7716>Thank you.</t7716> <t7717>I am sure that we all enjoyed the iced tea at dinner last night and that we are now equally enjoying our fiery president.</t7717> <t7718>I use the word "enjoy" in two senses, excluding, of course, the third, now obsolete.</t7718> <t7719>(Laughter.)</t7719>
<t7720>But let's be serious.</t7720> <t7721>I would like, as the title of this small talk indicates, to consider some of the problems associated with the supposed manuscript that is already well known to all of you and is titled The Handmaid's Tale.</t7721> <t7722>I say supposed because what we have before us is not the article in its original form.</t7722>
<t7723>In strict terms, when we discovered it, it was not a manuscript at all, and it did not have a title.</t7723> <t7724>The inscription "The Handmaid's Tale" was added by Professor Wade, partly as a tribute to the great Geoffrey Chaucer; but those of you who, like me, know Professor Wade more closely, will understand when I say that I am sure all the puns were intentional, especially the one related to the vulgar meaning of the word "tale" being to some extent the foundation of that phase of Gileadean society that our saga deals with.</t7724> <t7725>(Laughter, applause.)</t7725>
<t7726>This article, I dare not use the word document, was discovered at the site of what was once the city of Bangor, in what, in the time before the beginning of the Gileadean regime, had been the state of Maine.</t7726> <t7727>We know that this city was an important stopover of what our author calls "the Women's Metropolitan Train," as some of our humorous historians gave it the nickname "the Chicks' Metropolitan Train."</t7727> <t7728>(Laughter and whistles.)</t7728> <t7729>For this reason, our Association has taken a special interest in it.</t7729>
<t7730>The article in its original state consisted of a metal shoebox, for use by the United States Army, perhaps around nineteen fifty-five.</t7730> <t7731>This fact in itself does not have to be significant, as it is known that these shoeboxes were frequently sold as "army surplus," and therefore may have been scattered.</t7731> <t7732>Inside this shoebox, sealed with adhesive tape like the kind used in the past for postal packages, there were approximately thirty cassettes, of the type that became obsolete around the eighties or nineties, with the advent of compact discs.</t7732>
<t7733>I remind you that this is not the first discovery of this kind.</t7733> <t7734>Without a doubt, you are familiar with the article known as "The Memoirs of A. B.," found in a garage in a suburb of Seattle, and "The Diary of P.," accidentally unearthed during the construction of a new temple near what was once Syracuse, in New York.</t7734>
<t7735>Professor Wade and I were very excited about this new discovery.</t7735>
<t7736>Fortunately, several years earlier, with the help of our resident antique technician, we had reconstructed a device capable of playing such cassettes, and we immediately undertook the careful task of transcription.</t7736>
<t7737>In the collection, there were a total of about thirty cassettes, with varying proportions of music and words.</t7737> <t7738>Generally, each cassette begins with two or three songs, undoubtedly used as camouflage: then the music stops and a voice is heard.</t7738> <t7739>It is the voice of a woman and, according to our phonetics experts, it is the same from beginning to end.</t7739> <t7740>The cassette labels were authentic labels that dated, of course, from a time before the beginning of the first Gileadean era since, under this regime, all that profane music was banned.</t7740> <t7741>For example, there were four cassettes titled "The Golden Years of Elvis Presley," three of</t7741>
<t7742>"Popular Songs of Lithuania," three from "Boy George Takes It Off" and two from</t7742>
<t7743>"The Melodious Violins of Mantovani," as well as some titles for which there was only one cassette: "The Twin Sisters at Carnegie Hall," is one of my favorites.</t7743>
<t7744>Although the labels are authentic, they were not always placed on the cassette with the corresponding songs.</t7744> <t7745>Furthermore, the cassettes were not kept in any special order; they were just thrown at the bottom of the box, and they were not numbered either.</t7745> <t7746>So it fell to Professor Wade and myself to arrange the blocks of dialogue in the order that they seemed to follow; but, as I have said before, the result is based on conjecture and should be considered approximate and subject to further investigation.</t7746>
<t7747>Once we had completed the transcription, and after having to review it several times due to the difficulties posed by the accent, the allusions to unknown things, and the archaisms, we found ourselves obliged to make some decisions regarding the material we had so laboriously obtained.</t7747> <t7748>Several possibilities presented themselves to us.</t7748> <t7749>First of all, the cassettes could be a forgery.</t7749> <t7750>As you know, there have been several cases of forgeries of this type for which publishers have paid large sums, undoubtedly wishing to take advantage of the sensationalism of those accounts.</t7750> <t7751>It seems that certain periods of history quickly become, both for other societies and for those who live through them, a subject of not particularly edifying legends and a motive for hypocritical self-complacency.</t7751> <t7752>If I may make a side comment, I would say that in my opinion we must be cautious in our moral judgments about the Gileadeans.</t7752> <t7753>Surely we have already learned that such judgments are inevitably culture-specific.</t7753>
<t7754>Moreover, the Gileadean society was under strong pressure, demographic and otherwise, and was subject to factors from which we ourselves are free.</t7754>
<t7755>Our mission is not to censor but to understand.</t7755> <t7756>(Applause.)</t7756> <t7757>Setting aside my digression: in any case, it is quite difficult to convincingly falsify a cassette like this one, and the experts who analyzed them assured us that the physical objects themselves were genuine.</t7757> <t7758>By the way, the recording itself, that is, the overlay of the voice on the music, could not have been done in the last hundred or even fifty years.</t7758>
<t7759>Assuming, then, that the cassettes are authentic, what can be said about the nature of the narrative?</t7759> <t7760>Obviously, it could not have been recorded in the same time period it talks about because, if the author is telling the truth, she would not have had access to either a tape recorder or a cassette, nor would she have had anywhere to hide them.</t7760> <t7761>Furthermore, there is a certain reflective quality in her narration that, in my opinion, would rule out simultaneity.</t7761>
<t7762>He possesses a multitude of stored emotions, if not in tranquility, at least post facto.</t7762>
<t7763>We thought that if we could establish the identity of the narrator, we could find a way to explain how this document, allow me to call it that for the sake of brevity, came to light.</t7763> <t7764>For this, we used two lines of investigation.</t7764>
<t7765>First, we tried, using urban plans of Bangor and other remaining documentation, to identify the inhabitants of the house that should have been at the site of the discovery at that time.</t7765> <t7766>We reasoned that it had probably been a "safe house" of the Women's Metropolitan Train of that time, and the author might have hidden it in the attic or the cellar, for example, for weeks or months, during which time she would have had the opportunity to make the recordings.</t7766> <t7767>Of course, there was no indication that would allow us to rule out the possibility that the tapes had been moved to the site in question after being recorded.</t7767> <t7768>We hoped to be able to trace and locate the descendants of the hypothetical occupants who, we hoped, would lead us to other material: diaries, perhaps, or even family anecdotes passed down from generation to generation.</t7768>
<t7769>Unfortunately, this did not lead us to anything.</t7769> <t7770>Perhaps these people, if they really represented a link in the clandestine chain, had been discovered and arrested, in which case any documentation regarding them would have been destroyed.</t7770> <t7771>So we continued with the second line of attack.</t7771> <t7772>We searched the archives of the time, trying to relate historical figures to the individuals who appeared in our author's account.</t7772> <t7773>The archives that have remained from that time are in very poor condition, as the Gileadean regime had the habit of wiping out its own computers and destroying written material after various purges and internal disturbances; but some written material has survived.</t7773> <t7774>Incidentally, part of this material was smuggled into England for propaganda use by the various Women's Protection societies, which at that time proliferated in the British Isles.</t7774>
<t7775>We hold no hope of directly locating the narrator.</t7775> <t7776>Some internal evidence showed us that she was part of the first batch of women recruited for reproductive purposes and assigned to those who requested such services and could claim them, given their belonging to a select minority.</t7776> <t7777>The regime immediately created a reserve of women through the simple tactic of declaring all second marriages and non-marital unions adulterous and arresting the women, and on the basis that they were morally incapable, confiscated the children, who were adopted by childless couples belonging to the upper classes, who were eager to have offspring at any cost.</t7777> <t7778>(During the middle period, this policy was extended to include all marriages not contracted by the state church.)</t7778> <t7779>The men who held high positions in the regime could pick and choose among the women who had demonstrated their reproductive capabilities by having one or more healthy children, a desirable trait in an era of plummeting Caucasian birth rates, a phenomenon observable not only in Gilead but in most northern Caucasian societies of that time.</t7779>
<t7780>The causes of this decline are not entirely clear to us.</t7780> <t7781>Part of the failure regarding reproduction can undoubtedly be attributed to the wide availability of various types of birth control methods, including abortion, during the pre-Gileadean period.</t7781> <t7782>Infertility was partly desired, which can be explained by the different statistics between Caucasians and non-Caucasians, but not in its entirety.</t7782> <t7783>Do I need to remind you that this was the era of the R strain of syphilis and also of the infamous AIDS epidemic which, once it spread throughout the population, eliminated a large part of the young and sexually active population from the reproductive pool?</t7783> <t7784>Stillbirths, miscarriages, and genetic malformations spread and increased, and this trend has been linked to the various accidents at nuclear power plants, shutdowns, and sabotage incidents that characterized the period, as well as chemical leaks and biological warfare substances and toxic waste disposal sites, of which there were several thousand both legal and illegal; in some cases, these materials were simply dumped into the sewer system, and to the uncontrolled use of insecticides, herbicides, and other sprays.</t7784>
<t7785>But whatever the causes were, the effects were notable, and at that moment the regime of Gilead was not the only one to react to them.</t7785> <t7786>In the 1980s, for example, Romania had anticipated Gilead by banning all birth control methods, imposing mandatory pregnancy tests on the female population, and making promotions and salary increases contingent on fertility.</t7786>
<t7787>The need for what I would call birth services was already recognized in the pre-Gileadean period, where they were inadequately carried out through</t7787>
<t7788>"artificial insemination," "fertility clinics," and through the use of "surrogate mothers," who were hired for this purpose.</t7788> <t7789>The regime of Gilead proscribed the first two for being considered irreligious, but legitimized and encouraged the third, understanding that it had biblical precedents; thus, they replaced the common consecutive polygamy of the pre-Gilead period with the older form of simultaneous polygamy practiced both in the early times of the Old Testament and in the old state of Utah during the nineteenth century.</t7789> <t7790>As we know from the study of history, no new system can impose itself on the previous one without incorporating many of its elements, as demonstrated by the existence of pagan elements in medieval Christianity, and the evolution leading to the Russian "K. G. B." from the previous Tsarist secret service; and Gilead was no exception to the rule.</t7790>
<t7791>Their racist principles, for example, were firmly rooted in the pre-Gileadean period, and racist fears provided part of the emotional incentive that allowed the takeover in Gilead to be successful.</t7791>
<t7792>Our author was one among many and should be considered within the general lines of the historical period of which she was a part.</t7792> <t7793>But what else do we know about her, apart from her age, some characteristics that could be attributed to anyone, and her place of residence?</t7793> <t7794>Not much.</t7794> <t7795>She seems to have been a cultured woman, to the extent that one could call a graduate of any university in the United States cultured.</t7795>
<t7796>(Laughter, some whistles.)</t7796> <t7797>But, as you would say, the forests were teeming with specimens of this kind, so it didn't help us much.</t7797> <t7798>She does not provide us with her original name and, indeed, all official records following her admission to the Raquel and Leah Reeducation Center have been destroyed.</t7798> <t7799>The name</t7799>
<t7800>"Defred" does not provide us with any clues since, like "Deglen" and</t7800>
<t7801>"Dewarren" is a patronymic composed of the possessive preposition and the first name of the knight in question.</t7801> <t7802>Such names were adopted by these women once they came into contact with the family of a particular Commander, and they discarded them once they left that family.</t7802>
<t7803>The other names listed in the document are equally useless for the purpose of identification and authentication.</t7803> <t7804>“Luke” and “Nick” mean nothing, just like “Moira” and “Janine.”</t7804> <t7805>The most likely scenario, in any case, is that they were pseudonyms adopted to protect these individuals in case the tapes were discovered.</t7805> <t7806>If that were the case, it would justify our viewpoint that the tapes were recorded within the boundaries of Gilead with the intention of being smuggled out through the Mayday underground network.</t7806>
<t7807>After eliminating the previous possibilities, only one remained for us.</t7807> <t7808>We thought that being able to identify the elusive "Commander" would at least mean some progress.</t7808> <t7809>We considered that such a highly placed individual had probably participated initially in the secret organization Sons of Jacob Pro-Tanks, upon which the philosophy and social structure of Gilead was founded.</t7809> <t7810>This organization was formed shortly after the superpowers agreed to halt the arms race and signed the so-called Spheres of Influence Agreement, which allowed the superpowers freedom of action, without interference, regarding the growing rebellions taking place within their own borders.</t7810>
<t7811>The official records of the Sons of Jacob meetings were destroyed after the Great Purge of the middle period, which disgraced and liquidated some of the early architects of Gilead; but we have some information through the encrypted diary kept by Wilfred Limpkin, one of the sociobiologists of the time.</t7811>
<t7812>(As is well known, the sociobiological theory of natural polygamy was used as a scientific justification for some of the regime's less common practices, just as Darwinism was used by earlier ideologies.)</t7812> <t7813>Thanks to Limpkin's material, we know that there are two possible candidates, namely the two who incorporate the element "Fred" into their names: Frederick R. Waterford and B. Fredrick Judd.</t7813> <t7814>No photographs of them remain, although Limpkin describes the latter as a stiff person and, I quote: "someone for whom work is what is done on the golf course."</t7814> <t7815>(Laughter.)</t7815> <t7816>Limpkin himself did not survive long under the Gilead regime, and if we have his diary, it is only because he foresaw his own end and gave it to his sister-in-law in Calgary.</t7816>
<t7817>Both Waterford and Judd have characteristics that make them worthy of analysis.</t7817> <t7818>Waterford possessed market research knowledge and, according to Limpkin, was responsible for the design of the female uniforms and the idea that the Handmaids should wear red, an idea that seems to have been taken from the uniforms of German prisoners of war who were in Canadian prisoner camps during the Second World War.</t7818> <t7819>He appears to have been the creator of the term "Particicution," for which he was inspired by a very popular exercise program during the last third of the century; nonetheless, the collective ceremony of the rope was suggested by a custom from a seventeenth-century English village.</t7819> <t7820>The term "Salvaging" must also have been his, although by the time of Gilead's establishment, this term, originating from the Philippines, had become a general term to refer to the elimination of political enemies.</t7820> <t7821>As I have said on another occasion, there were very few original or native things in Gilead: its genius lay in synthesis.</t7821>
<t7822>On the other hand, Judd seems to have been less interested in packaging and more in tactics.</t7822> <t7823>It was he who suggested the use of an unknown pamphlet from the "C. IA." about destabilizing a few foreign governments as a strategy manual for the Sons of Jacob, and he also drafted the first lists of "Americans".</t7823>
<t7824>prominent figures of the time.</t7824> <t7825>It is also suspected that he organized the President's Assassination Day, which must have required significant infiltration of the Congress's security systems and without which the Constitution could never have been suspended.</t7825> <t7826>The National Homeland and the project of shipping off the Jews were also his creations, as was the idea of privatizing the Jewish repatriation program, resulting in more than one ship loaded with Jews being sunk in the Atlantic to increase profits.</t7826> <t7827>As far as we know about Judd, this likely did not concern him much.</t7827> <t7828>He belonged to the hardline faction, and Limpkin makes the following observation about him: "Our great mistake was teaching him to read.</t7828> <t7829>We will not make it again."</t7829>
<t7830>It is Judd who is credited with having devised the form, as opposed to the name, of the Particicution ceremony, arguing that it was not only a horrifying and effective way to dispose of subversive elements, but also acted as a valve for the female members of Gilead.</t7830> <t7831>Propitiatory victims have been notably useful throughout history, and for these Handmaids, so rigidly controlled at other times, it must have been very gratifying to be able to tear a man apart with their own hands from time to time.</t7831> <t7832>This practice became so popular and effective that it was regularized during the middle period, when it took place four times a year, during the solstices and equinoxes.</t7832> <t7833>Here there are reminiscences of the fertility rites that were practiced in the early cults of earth goddesses.</t7833> <t7834>As we mentioned in the jury debate yesterday afternoon, Gilead, although undoubtedly patriarchal in form, was also at times matriarchal in content, much like some sectors of the social structure that originated it.</t7834> <t7835>As the architects of Gilead well knew, to impose an effective totalitarian system, or any other system, some benefits and freedoms must be offered, at least to a few privileged ones, in exchange for those that are suppressed.</t7835>
<t7836>In this regard, I find it pertinent to make some comments about the curious female control agency known as the "Aunts."</t7836> <t7837>According to the material provided by Limpkin, Judd was of the opinion from the beginning that the best and most effective way to control women in reproduction and other aspects was through women themselves.</t7837> <t7838>There are several historical precedents for this; in fact, no empire imposed by force or other means has lacked this characteristic: the control of natives through members of their own group.</t7838> <t7839>In the case of Gilead, there were many women eager to serve as Aunts, either out of genuine belief in what they called "traditional values," or for the benefits they could obtain from it.</t7839> <t7840>When power is scarce, it becomes tempting.</t7840> <t7841>It also had a negative incentive: older women, childless or sterile who were not married could serve as Aunts and thus avoid unemployment and the consequent transfer to the infamous Colonies, which were composed of floating populations mainly used as expendable teams for toxic waste disposal, although the lucky ones could be assigned to less dangerous tasks, such as cotton picking or fruit harvesting.</t7841>
<t7842>The idea, then, came from Judd, but the execution bore Waterford's mark.</t7842> <t7843>Which other member of the Sons of Jacob Pro-tanks would have thought of the idea that the Aunts should carry names derived from commercial products used by women in the pre-Gileadean period, and therefore familiar and reassuring to them, such as the names of cosmetic products, cake mixes, frozen desserts, and even medicines?</t7843> <t7844>It was a brilliant stroke and confirms our opinion that, in his prime, Waterford was a man of considerable wit.</t7844> <t7845>As was Judd, in his own style.</t7845>
<t7846>It was known that neither of the two men had had children and therefore could enjoy the right to the Handmaids' offspring.</t7846> <t7847>In the article we wrote together, "The Notion of 'Seed' in the Early Days of Gilead," Professor Wade and I concluded that both men, like many Commanders, had come into contact with a virus causing sterility, developed through secret gene-coupling experiments during the pre-Gileadean period, and that it was intended to be inserted into the caviar substitute consumed by high-ranking Moscow officials.</t7847> <t7848>(The experiment was abandoned after the Spheres of Influence Agreement, because the virus was considered absolutely uncontrollable and also very dangerous for many, although some wanted to spread it throughout the territory of India.)</t7848>
<t7849>In any case, neither Judd nor Waterford were ever married to any woman named "Pam" or "Serena Joy."</t7849> <t7850>This last name seems to have been a malicious invention by our author.</t7850> <t7851>The name of Judd's wife was Bambi Mae, and the name of Waterford's wife was Thelma.</t7851> <t7852>However, the latter had been a television figure, of the type described in the narration.</t7852> <t7853>We learned this through Limpkin's material, which makes several sarcastic observations about it.</t7853>
<t7854>The regime itself took great care to cover up the deviations from orthodoxy by the wives of the privileged classes.</t7854>
<t7855>The evidence tips the scales in favor of Waterford.</t7855> <t7856>We know, for example, that he probably died shortly after the events our author describes, in one of the early purges; he was accused of having liberal tendencies and of being in possession of a significant unauthorized collection of heretical pictorial and literary material, and of harboring a subversive person.</t7856> <t7857>This happened before the regime began holding trials in secret, and therefore they were still televised, so that trial was recorded in England via satellite and is found in the recording archives of our files.</t7857> <t7858>The shots of Waterford are not very good, but clear enough to ensure that his hair was indeed gray.</t7858>
<t7859>As for the subversive person that Waterford was accused of covering up, it could have been "Offred" herself, as her escape might have placed her in that category.</t7859> <t7860>As the very existence of the tapes demonstrates, it is most likely that it was "Nick" who helped "Offred" escape.</t7860> <t7861>The way he did it points to him being a member of the clandestine organization Mayday, which was not the same as the Women's Metropolitan Train, but had relations with it.</t7861> <t7862>The latter was a simple quasi-military rescue operation.</t7862> <t7863>It is known that a number of Mayday components had infiltrated the highest levels of Gileadean power structures and that placing one of its members as Waterford's chauffeur would certainly have been a coup; a double coup, since "Nick" must have also been a member of the Eyes, as was often the case with chauffeurs and personal servants.</t7863> <t7864>Waterford, of course, must have known; but, like all high-level Commanders, he was automatically a director of the Eyes and must not have paid much attention nor let it interfere with his infringement of what he considered minor rules.</t7864> <t7865>Like the vast majority of the early Gilead Commanders who were later purged, he considered his position above any attack.</t7865> <t7866>The style of the mid-Gilead period was more cautious.</t7866>
<t7867>These are our conjectures.</t7867> <t7868>Assuming they are correct, that is, assuming that Waterford was indeed the "Commander," many questions still remain.</t7868> <t7869>Some of them could have been cleared up by our anonymous author, if she had had a different way of seeing things.</t7869> <t7870>If she had had the instinct of a journalist, or a spy, she could have explained many things to us about the functioning of the Gileadean empire.</t7870> <t7871>What wouldn't we give now for twenty pages written from Waterford's private computer!</t7871> <t7872>In any case, we must be grateful for the crumbs that the Goddess of History has seen fit to grant us.</t7872>
<t7873>As for the final fate of our narrator, it remains in the dark.</t7873> <t7874>Was she smuggled across the border of Gilead to what was then Canada, and managed to make her way from there to England?</t7874> <t7875>This would have been an intelligent decision since Canada at that time did not want to antagonize its powerful neighbor and organized raids and extradited refugees.</t7875> <t7876>In that case, why didn't she take the recorded narration with her?</t7876> <t7877>Perhaps her journey was decided at the last moment; perhaps she feared being detained along the way.</t7877> <t7878>On the other hand, she might have been recaptured.</t7878> <t7879>If she did indeed make it to England, why didn't she reveal her story, as many did once they reached the outside world?</t7879> <t7880>She might have feared reprisals against "Luke," assuming he was still alive, which is unlikely, or even against her daughter; because the Gileadean regime was not incapable of such measures, and took them in order to discourage adverse publicity in foreign countries.</t7880> <t7881>It is known that more than one unsuspecting refugee received a hand, an ear, or a foot vacuum-packed and hidden, for example, in a coffee can.</t7881> <t7882>Or perhaps she was among the Handmaids who fled and had difficulty adapting to the outside world, after the sheltered life they had led.</t7882> <t7883>Like them, she may have become a loner.</t7883> <t7884>We do not know.</t7884>
<t7885>We can only make deductions also regarding the motivations of</t7885>
<t7886>"Nick" to organize the escape.</t7886> <t7887>We can assume that once Deglen was discovered, his association with Mayday put him in danger because, as a member of the Eyes, he knew very well that Offred herself would be interrogated.</t7887> <t7888>The penalty for unauthorized sexual activity with a Handmaid was severe, and his status as an Eye did not protect him.</t7888> <t7889>Gileadean society was extremely byzantine, and any transgression could be used against someone by undeclared enemies within the regime.</t7889> <t7890>Of course, he could have killed her, which would have been the smarter path, but the human heart remains a decisive factor, and as we know, both of them thought she might be carrying his child.</t7890> <t7891>What man of the Gileadean period could resist the possibility of being a father, something so imbued with status and so precious?</t7891> <t7892>Instead, he called a rescue team from the Eyes, who may or may not have been genuine, but in any case, they worked under his orders.</t7892> <t7893>This may have also led to his own downfall.</t7893> <t7894>We will never know.</t7894>
<t7895>Did our narrator arrive safe and sound in the outside world and build a new life?</t7895> <t7896>Or was she discovered in her attic hideout, arrested, sent to the Colonies or Jezebel’s, or even executed?</t7896> <t7897>Our document, though eloquent in its own way, does not answer these questions.</t7897> <t7898>We could summon Eurydice from the world of the dead, but we could not get her to respond; and when we turn to look at her, we glimpse her only for a moment, before she slips from our hands and vanishes.</t7898> <t7899>As all historians know, the past is a vast darkness filled with resonances.</t7899> <t7900>From it, some voices may reach us; but what they tell us is imbued with the darkness of the matrix from which they emerge.</t7900> <t7901>And, no matter how hard we try, we cannot always decipher them and illuminate them with the pristine light of our own time.</t7901>
<t7902>Applause.</t7902>
<t7903>Any questions?</t7903>
