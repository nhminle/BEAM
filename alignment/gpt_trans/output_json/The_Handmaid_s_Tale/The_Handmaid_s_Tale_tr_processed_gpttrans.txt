<t0>I</t0>
<t1>Night</t1>
<t2>1</t2>
<t3>We used to sleep in a place that was once a gymnasium.</t3> <t4>The floor was polished parquet, bearing the lines and circles drawn for games played in the past; the hoops of the basketball nets were still in place, but the nets were gone.</t4> <t5>A balcony surrounded the hall, for spectators, and from what I know from pictures, I imagined I could smell the sharp scent of sweat mingling with the pleasant aroma of gum and perfume from the girls in felt skirts at first, then mini-skirts, later pants, and finally with earrings in one ear and stiff hair with green streaks, like a fleeting afterimage.</t5> <t6>Balls were also held there; the music would be dying: like a parchment of unheard sound, layer upon layer, with drum sounds coming from underneath, a desperate cry; garlands made of thin paper flowers; cardboard devil masks; a rotating glass ball sprinkling a snow of light over the dancers.</t6>
<t7>There was a sexuality left in the past in the room, and loneliness and expectation, of something without form or name.</t7> <t8>I remember the longing we felt for something always changing and about to happen, like the hands on us there and then, in the parking lot or on the bodies moving up and down, in the silent TV room where only the images flickered, on the narrowest part of the back or outside.</t8>
<t9>We also longed for the future.</t9> <t10>How did we acquire this ability, this insatiability?</t10> <t11>It was in the air; it was still in the air as we tried to sleep on military-issue portable beds lined up at intervals that made conversation impossible; like a belated thought.</t11> <t12>We had flannel sheets, similar to those of children, and still</t12> <t13>old military-issue blankets with "US" written on them.</t13> <t14>We would neatly fold our clothes and place them on the stools at the foot of the beds.</t14> <t15>The lights were not turned off but dimmed.</t15> <t16>Aunt Sara and Aunt Elizabeth would patrol; they had electric prods hanging from the straps on their leather belts.</t16>
<t17>Still, they had no weapons; they were too untrustworthy to be given weapons.</t17> <t18>The weapons were especially for the Guardians chosen from among the Angels.</t18> <t19>The Guardians were not allowed to enter the building unless summoned, and we were not allowed to go outside, except for our walks; twice a day, in pairs, around the football field now surrounded by barbed wire.</t19> <t20>The Angels would stand outside this fence with their backs turned to us.</t20> <t21>They were objects of fear for us, but they were also something else.</t21> <t22>Oh, if only they would look!</t22> <t23>If only we could talk to them.</t23> <t24>We thought something could be exchanged, a deal, a trade, we still had our bodies.</t24> <t25>This was our fantasy.</t25>
<t26>We almost learned to whisper silently.</t26> <t27>In the semi-darkness, we could reach out our arms, and when the Aunts weren't looking, we could cross the void and touch each other's hands.</t27> <t28>We also learned to read lips, our heads pressed against the pillow, turned sideways, watching each other's lips.</t28> <t29>We communicated our names this way, from bed to bed: Alma.</t29> <t30>Janine.</t30> <t31>Dolores.</t31> <t32>Moira.</t32> <t33>June.</t33>
<t34>II</t34>
<t35>Shopping</t35>
<t36>2</t36>
<t37>A chair, a table, a lamp.</t37> <t38>A relief decoration in the shape of a wreath on the white ceiling and in the middle a plastered empty area resembling a hole in a face with one eye removed.</t38> <t39>There must have been a chandelier hanging there once.</t39> <t40>They have removed everything that could be hung.</t40>
<t41>A window, two white curtains.</t41> <t42>Below the curtains, a window seat with a small pillow on it.</t42> <t43>When the window is half-opened - it won't open any further anyway - the wind can come in and move the curtains.</t43> <t44>I can sit on the chair or the window seat, clasp my hands, and watch this.</t44> <t45>Daylight also enters through the window and reflects on the floor covered with narrow-striped, overly polished parquet.</t45> <t46>I can smell the polish.</t46> <t47>On the floor, an oval rug, woven from rags.</t47> <t48>This is what they like: folk art, archaic, made by women, in their spare time, from things that serve no other purpose.</t48> <t49>A return to traditional values.</t49> <t50>Waste not, want not.</t50> <t51>I'm not being wasted.</t51> <t52>Why would I want to be?</t52>
<t53>A picture on the wall above the chair, framed but without glass: a flower print, blue irises, watercolor.</t53> <t54>The flower is still allowed.</t54> <t55>Do we each have the same picture, the same chair, the same white curtains?</t55> <t56>Government property?</t56>
<t57>Imagine that you are in the army, Aunt Lydia would say.</t57>
<t58>A bed.</t58> <t59>Single, with a medium-firm mattress, covered with a woolly white blanket.</t59> <t60>Nothing happens in the bed except sleeping; or not being able to sleep.</t60> <t61>I try not to think too much.</t61> <t62>Like other things, now thoughts should also be rationed.</t62> <t63>There are many things that are unbearable to think about.</t63> <t64>Thinking can push one's luck, but my goal is to endure.</t64> <t65>I know why the watercolor painting of blue irises is without glass, why the window is only half-open, and why the glass is unbreakable.</t65> <t66>What they fear is not our escape.</t66> <t67>We can't go too far anyway.</t67> <t68>It's the other escapes you can make with something sharp within yourself that they fear.</t68>
<t69>That's how it is.</t69> <t70>Aside from these details, this could be a college guest room, for less distinguished visitors; or a boarding house room, from old times, for ladies with limited means.</t70> <t71>This is who we are.</t71> <t72>Limited means for those of us who still have means.</t72>
<t73>However, the chair, daylight, flowers: These cannot be removed.</t73> <t74>I am alive, I am living, I am breathing, I extend my hand into the daylight without breaking it.</t74> <t75>The place I am in is not a prison, on the contrary, it is a privilege, as Aunt Lydia, who loves 'either/or' phrases, would say.</t75>
<t76>The bell that measures time is ringing.</t76> <t77>As it used to be in monasteries, time here is also measured by bells.</t77> <t78>Again, like in a monastery, there are very few mirrors here.</t78>
<t79>I get up from my chair, stretching my feet in red shoes with flat heels designed not for dancing but for protecting the spine into the daylight.</t79> <t80>The red gloves are on the bed.</t80> <t81>I pick them up and put them on, sliding each finger into place one by one.</t81> <t82>Everything is red, except for the wings on either side of my face: the color of the blood that defines us.</t82> <t83>The dress extends down to the ankles, loose, gathered with a wide band around the chest, and the sleeves are loose as well.</t83> <t84>The white wings are also by command; to prevent us from seeing, and of course, from being seen.</t84> <t85>Red has never suited me, it is not my color.</t85> <t86>I take the shopping basket and hang it on my arm.</t86>
<t87>The door of the room -not my room, I refuse to call it mine- is not locked.</t87> <t88>In fact, it doesn't even close properly.</t88> <t89>I step out into the polished corridor with a dirty pink runner in the middle.</t89> <t90>Like a path in the forest, a royal carpet shows me the way.</t90>
<t91>After a bend, the carpet goes down the front stairs, and I follow it, one hand on the banister, which was once a tree, made in another century and polished until it took on a warm glow.</t91> <t92>A late Victorian-style family house, built for a large and wealthy family.</t92> <t93>In the hall, there is an aged wall clock that kindly shows the time and a door that opens to the matronly sitting room at the front, with its beige tones and hints, a sitting room where I never sat, only stood or knelt.</t93> <t94>At the end of the hall, above the front door, there is a stained glass window: flowers, red and blue.</t94>
<t95>Only the mirror on the hall wall remains.</t95> <t96>As I descend the stairs, if I turn my head in such a way that the white wings on either side of my face direct my view towards the mirror, I see the round, convex, fish-eye-like glass mirror and myself reflected in it; a distorted shadow, a parody of something, like a fairy tale character in a red cloak descending towards a momentary carelessness equivalent to danger.</t96> <t97>A nun, stained with blood.</t97>
<t98>At the end of the stairs, there is a hat-and-umbrella stand with long, round wooden arms that gently curve towards hooks shaped like the unfurling fronds of a twisted fern.</t98> <t99>Inside it, there are a few umbrellas: a black one assigned to the Commander, a blue one to the Commander's Wife, and a red one to me.</t99> <t100>I leave the red umbrella where it is, having seen from the window that the day was sunny.</t100> <t101>I wonder if the Commander's Wife is in the sitting room.</t101> <t102>She doesn't always sit there.</t102> <t103>Sometimes, I can hear her pacing back and forth, one heavy and then one light footstep, and the soft taps of her cane on the dirty rose-colored carpet.</t103>
<t104>Walking through the hallway, I pass the living room door and the door leading to the dining room, then open the door at the end of the hallway and enter the kitchen.</t104> <t105>This place no longer smells of furniture polish.</t105> <t106>Rita is standing next to the kitchen table, which is covered with white enamel.</t106> <t107>She is wearing a familiar Martha dress, a dull green color reminiscent of an old operator's uniform.</t107> <t108>This dress is very similar to mine in terms of shape, length, and concealment, but it has an apron, no white wings, and no veil.</t108> <t109>She wears the veil when she goes outside, but no one really cares about seeing a Martha's face.</t109> <t110>The sleeves of her dress are rolled up to her elbows, revealing the brownness of her arms.</t110> <t111>She is busy making bread, throwing the loaves onto the table for the final kneading and shaping.</t111>
<t112>Rita sees me and nods her head; it's hard to tell if it's to greet me or simply to acknowledge my presence. She wipes her floury hands on her apron and starts searching for the report card in the kitchen drawer.</t112> <t113>With a frown, she tears off three report cards and hands them to me.</t113> <t114>If she smiled, her face could look kind.</t114> <t115>However, her frown is not personal: it's about the red dress she disapproves of and what it represents.</t115> <t116>She thinks I could be contagious, like a disease or bad luck.</t116>
<t117>Sometimes I stand in front of closed doors and eavesdrop, something I would never have done before.</t117> <t118>I don't listen for too long, because I don't want to get caught doing it.</t118> <t119>Still, once, I heard Rita telling Cora that she wouldn't demean herself to that extent.</t119>
<t120>Nobody is asking this of you, said Cora.</t120> <t121>Anyway, what could you do if they did?</t121>
<t122>I would go to the colonies, said Rita.</t122> <t123>They have a choice.</t123>
<t124>To the place where the Non-Women are?</t124> <t125>To that place where starvation and God knows what else await you? said Cora.</t125> <t126>Don't be ridiculous.</t126>
<t127>They were shelling peas, and even through the closed door, I could hear the soft clatter of the hard peas falling into the pot.</t127> <t128>I could hear Rita grumbling or sighing as a sign of either disapproval or agreement.</t128>
<t129>Anyway, they do this for all of us, they say the same to Cora.</t129> <t130>If my tubes hadn't been tied, I could have been one of them, if I were ten years younger, for instance.</t130> <t131>It's not that bad.</t131> <t132>Besides, you can't call this hard work.</t132>
<t133>Rita said, "It's better for her to be in my place," as I opened the door.</t133> <t134>Their faces were like those of women who talk behind your back and think they are not heard: surprised, a bit arrogant as if it were their right to speak that way.</t134> <t135>That day, Cora had been more pleasant than usual to me, and Rita had been more irritable.</t135>
<t136>Today, despite Rita's sullen face and tense lips, I would have liked to stay here, in the kitchen.</t136> <t137>From another part of the house, Cora would come in with a bottle of lemon oil and a dust cloth, and Rita would make coffee -there is still real coffee in the Commanders' houses- and we would chat at Rita's kitchen table -just as my table wasn't mine, this table wasn't Rita's anymore- talking about aches, pains, and illnesses, that is, all those different ailments our feet, backs, and bodies could acquire like mischievous children.</t137> <t138>We would nod our heads to punctuate each other's words, meaning yes, we know all of this.</t138> <t139>We would suggest remedies to each other and try to outdo one another while describing our physical sufferings; we would complain politely, our voices soft and low-pitched, and as mournful as pigeons in the rain gutters.</t139> <t140>We understand what you mean, we would say.</t140> <t141>Or, from time to time, we would utter that strange phrase we still hear from old people: I heard where you're coming from.</t141> <t142>As if the voice were a traveler coming from afar; actually, it was, and it is.</t142>
<t143>I used to hate these kinds of conversations so much.</t143> <t144>Now I miss them.</t144> <t145>At least it was a conversation.</t145> <t146>A kind of exchange.</t146>
<t147>Or we would gossip.</t147> <t148>The Marthas always know something, they talk among themselves, spreading unofficial news from house to house.</t148> <t149>They eavesdrop like me, undoubtedly, and can see what's happening even when their eyes are looking elsewhere.</t149> <t150>Sometimes I would overhear them, catching sentences from their private conversations.</t150> <t151>Stillborn.</t151> <t152>Or, She stabbed him, right in the stomach.</t152> <t153>It must have been jealousy eating her up.</t153> <t154>Or, The thing the girl used was toilet cleaner.</t154> <t155>You'd think a person would taste it, but it worked just the same.</t155> <t156>So he was that drunk; they only figured out what the girl did later.</t156>
<t157>Or, I would help Rita make bread, plunging my hands into that soft, resilient warmth that resembles meat.</t157> <t158>I am craving to touch something, something other than fabric or wood.</t158> <t159>I am craving the act of touching.</t159>
<t160>However, even if I could ask, even if I could violate etiquette to this extent, Rita would not allow it.</t160> <t161>She would be terrified.</t161> <t162>It is unthinkable for the Marthas to fraternize with us.</t162>
<t163>To fraternize means to behave like a brother.</t163> <t164>Luke told me this.</t164> <t165>He said there was no suitable word that means to behave like a sister.</t165> <t166>It should be sororize, he said.</t166> <t167>From Latin.</t167> <t168>Luke used to enjoy knowing these kinds of details.</t168> <t169>The origins of words, their strange usages.</t169> <t170>I used to tease him by calling him a know-it-all.</t170>
<t171>I'm taking the report cards from Rita's hand.</t171> <t172>There are pictures on them of things that can be traded: twelve eggs, a piece of cheese, something brown that is supposed to be meat.</t172> <t173>I place them in the zippered wallet where I keep my transit pass, inside the sleeve of my dress.</t173>
<t174>“Tell them to give fresh eggs,” says Rita.</t174> <t175>“Not like last time.</t175> <t176>And a chick, tell them that, not a chicken.</t176> <t177>Tell them who it’s for, so they don’t mess around.</t177><t178>”</t178>
<t179>"Alright," I say.</t179> <t180>I don't smile.</t180> <t181>Why should I entice him into friendship?</t181>
<t182>3</t182>
<t183>I am exiting through the back door, into the wide and orderly garden: in the middle, a grassy area, a willow tree, the drooping flowers of the willow tree; on the edges, flower beds, within them, daffodils that are wilting and tulips that are blooming, spreading color all around.</t183> <t184>The tulips are red; closer to their stems, they are darker, as if they have been cut and are starting to heal from there.</t184>
<t185>This garden is under the dominion of the Commander's Wife.</t185> <t186>While looking outside from my unbreakable window, I had often seen her in the garden, a cushion under her knees, a light blue veil thrown over her wide garden hat, and beside her, a basket containing scissors and pieces of string to tie the flowers in place.</t186> <t187>One of the Guardians assigned to the Commander does the heavy digging work; the Commander's Wife directs him, pointing with her cane.</t187> <t188>Most of the Wives have such gardens, something for them to arrange, maintain, and cherish.</t188>
<t189>Once upon a time, I also had a garden.</t189> <t190>I can remember the smell of the dug-up soil, the stout shapes of the flower bulbs held in hand, their fullness, the dry rustle made by the seeds flowing through fingers.</t190> <t191>Time could pass more quickly this way.</t191> <t192>Sometimes, the Commander's Wife would have a chair brought and just sit in her garden.</t192> <t193>From a distance, this scene evokes tranquility.</t193>
<t194>She's not here right now; I'm starting to wonder where she is: I don't like running into the Commander's Wife unexpectedly.</t194> <t195>Maybe she's knitting, in the sitting room, with her left foot on a stool because of her arthritis.</t195> <t196>Or she's knitting a scarf, for the Angels on the front line.</t196> <t197>I don't think the Angels really need such scarves; still, the Commander's Wife's work is very meticulous.</t197> <t198>She doesn't pay much attention to the cross-and-star pattern used by the other Wives, it doesn't challenge her.</t198> <t199>At the ends of her scarves, pine trees appear, or eagles, or motionless human figures standing side by side, a boy and a girl, a boy and a girl.</t199> <t200>These are not for adult men, but for children.</t200>
<t201>Sometimes, I think that these scarves are never sent to the Angels, but are unraveled and sent back as balls of yarn, to be knitted again when the time comes.</t201> <t202>Maybe it's to keep the Wives busy, to give them a sense of purpose.</t202> <t203>Still, I envy the Commander's Wife's knitting.</t203> <t204>It's good to have small, easily attainable goals.</t204>
<t205>I wonder what of mine he/she is jealous of?</t205>
<t206>He doesn't talk to me unless it's unavoidable.</t206> <t207>To him, I am a shame; and a necessity.</t207>
<t208>We had come face to face for the first time five weeks ago when I arrived at this post.</t208> <t209>The Guardian of the previous post had brought me to the front door.</t209> <t210>In the early days, we are allowed to use the front doors.</t210> <t211>But after that, we are expected to use the back door.</t211> <t212>Things haven't settled down completely, it's still very early, no one is sure exactly what our status is.</t212> <t213>After a while, we will either always use the front door or always use the back door.</t213>
<t214>Aunt Lydia had said she was lobbying for the front door.</t214> <t215>She used to say that yours is an honorable position.</t215>
<t216>The guard rang the bell for me, but before enough time had passed for someone to hear the bell and come quickly, the door suddenly opened inward.</t216> <t217>He must have been waiting behind the door.</t217> <t218>I was expecting a Martha, but it was him who appeared: unmistakably, in his dusty blue outfit.</t218>
<t219>"So, you're the new arrival," he said.</t219> <t220>He didn't step aside to let me in, just stood there in the doorway, blocking the entrance.</t220> <t221>He wanted to make me feel that I couldn't enter the house without his permission.</t221> <t222>These kinds of encounters have been happening with a lot of pushing and shoving lately.</t222>
<t223>Yes, I said.</t223>
<t224>Leave it on the veranda.</t224> <t225>She had said this to the Guard who was carrying my bag.</t225> <t226>The bag was made of red vinyl and wasn't too big.</t226> <t227>There was another bag containing my winter cloak and thicker clothes, but that would come later.</t227>
<t228>The guard dropped the bag and saluted him.</t228> <t229>Then, behind me, I could hear the footsteps of the returning guard, the front door closing with a click, and I felt as if a protective arm had been withdrawn.</t229> <t230>The threshold of a new house is filled with loneliness.</t230>
<t231>He waited for the car to start and drive away.</t231> <t232>I was looking at the parts of her I could see with my head bowed: her thickened waist under the blue dress, her left hand on the ivory handle of her cane, the large diamonds on her ring finger, which must have been beautiful once and still well-maintained, the slightly curved, filed nail at the tip of her bony finger.</t232> <t233>The curve on her finger was like an ironic smile, as if mocking her.</t233>
<t234>You can come in now, he said.</t234> <t235>He turned his back to me and limped down the hall.</t235> <t236>Close the door behind you.</t236>
<t237>I carried the red bag inside, there was no doubt that was the intention, then I closed the door.</t237> <t238>I didn't say anything to her.</t238> <t239>It's best not to speak unless they ask you something directly, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t239> <t240>Try to think from their perspective, she would say, with her hands clasped tightly together, her nervous, defensive smile.</t240> <t241>It's not easy for them either.</t241>
<t242>"Come in," said the Commander's Wife.</t242> <t243>When I entered the living room, she was already seated in her chair, with her left foot extended onto a cushioned stool embroidered with a rose basket.</t243> <t244>Her knitting was on the floor, beside the chair.</t244> <t245>With the needles stuck into it.</t245>
<t246>I stood with my hands clasped in front of me.</t246> <t247>So, that's how it is, she said.</t247> <t248>She placed a cigarette between her lips and clenched it tightly as she lit it.</t248> <t249>Her lips were thin, and with the small vertical lines around them, they resembled the lips seen in old lipstick advertisements.</t249> <t250>The lighter was ivory-colored.</t250> <t251>The cigarettes must be from the black market, I thought, and this gave me hope.</t251> <t252>Even now, in a time when real money is no longer available, there is still a black market.</t252> <t253>There is always a black market, always something that can be traded.</t253> <t254>So, she was a woman who could bend the rules.</t254> <t255>But what did I have that I could trade?</t255>
<t256>I was looking at the cigarette with longing.</t256> <t257>Like liqueur and coffee, cigarettes are also forbidden to me.</t257>
<t258>So, the old "nesi-var" game didn't work, he said.</t258>
<t259>No, Sir, I said.</t259>
<t260>He made a sound that could be called a laugh, then coughed.</t260> <t261>Poor man, he said.</t261> <t262>This is your second job, isn't it?</t262>
<t263>Third, Sir, I said.</t263>
<t264>"It's not very good for you either," he said.</t264> <t265>He laughed again, mixed with a cough.</t265> <t266>"You can sit down."</t266> <t267>"I don't want this to become a habit, just this once."</t267>
<t268>I perched on the edge of one of the straight-backed chairs.</t268> <t269>I didn't want to stare around the room, nor did I want to appear indifferent to him; at that moment, the marble fireplace mantle to my right, the mirror above it, and the bouquets of flowers were just shadows, seen out of the corner of my eye.</t269> <t270>Later, I would have plenty of time to examine them.</t270>
<t271>Now her face was at the same level as mine.</t271><t272>It seemed like I knew her from somewhere; or at least there was something familiar about her.</t272><t273>A strand of hair was visible from under her veil.</t273><t274>She was still blonde.</t274><t275>At that time, I thought maybe she dyed her hair, and that the hair dye was another thing she obtained from the black market, but now I know she was truly blonde.</t275><t276>Her eyebrows were shaped into thin, curved lines, giving her a constant look of surprise, anger, or curiosity that you might see in a bewildered child; but the eyelids beneath her eyebrows looked tired.</t276><t277>However, not her eyes, they were the hostile blue of a summer sky under a scorching sun, a blue that excluded you.</t277><t278>Her nose must have been considered cute once, but now it was too small for her face.</t278><t279>Her face was not full, but it was wide.</t279><t280>Two lines ran down from the corners of her mouth; between them was her chin, like a clenched fist.</t280>
<t281>I want to see you as little as possible, he said.</t281> <t282>I expect you to think the same way.</t282>
<t283>I didn't respond, because saying yes would be to belittle, and saying no would be to oppose.</t283>
<t284>I know you're not stupid, he continued.</t284> <t285>He took a drag from his cigarette and blew out the smoke.</t285> <t286>I've read your file.</t286> <t287>In my opinion, this looks like a business deal.</t287> <t288>But if you cause me trouble, I'll cause you trouble too.</t288> <t289>Do you understand?</t289>
<t290>Yes, Sir, I said.</t290>
<t291>Don't call me Sir, he said angrily.</t291> <t292>You are not a Martha.</t292>
<t293>I didn't ask how I should address her, because I could understand that she hoped such an event would never occur.</t293> <t294>I was disappointed.</t294> <t295>At that moment, I wanted to turn her into a sister, a mother figure, someone who would understand and protect me.</t295> <t296>The Wife at my previous posting had spent most of her time in the bedroom; the Marthas said she was drinking.</t296> <t297>I wanted this one to be different.</t297> <t298>I wanted to think that I could have loved her in another time and place, in another life.</t298> <t299>But I could already see that I couldn't love her, and she couldn't love me.</t299>
<t300>He extinguished his half-smoked cigarette in the small round ashtray on the side table next to him.</t300> <t301>He did this decisively, pressing it down in one go, not with the polite and gentle taps that most Spouses preferred.</t301>
<t302>When it comes to my husband, she said, he is what he is.</t302> <t303>He is my husband, after all.</t303> <t304>I want this to be fully understood.</t304> <t305>Until death do us part.</t305> <t306>This is what's certain.</t306>
<t307>Yes, Sir, I said again, forgetting.</t307> <t308>In the past, there were dolls for little girls that would speak when you pulled the string on their back; I thought my voice came out like that, monotonous, like a doll's voice.</t308> <t309>Surely, he must have wanted to slap me.</t309> <t310>They can hit us, there are examples in the Bible that respond to this.</t310> <t311>Not with any tool.</t311> <t312>They can only use their hands.</t312>
<t313>This is one of the things we fight for, said the Commander's Wife, suddenly stopping looking at me and starting to look at her bony, diamond-adorned hands, I realized where I had seen her before.</t313>
<t314>I first saw her on television when I was eight or nine years old.</t314> <t315>On Sunday mornings, while my mother slept, I would get up early, go to the television in the study, and scan the channels looking for cartoons.</t315> <t316>Sometimes, when I couldn't find any cartoons, I would watch the Bible Hour for Growing Souls, where they told Bible stories for children and sang hymns.</t316> <t317>One of the women was named Serena Joy.</t317> <t318>She was the lead soprano.</t318> <t319>She was blonde and delicate, with a small, upturned nose and large blue eyes that she lifted upwards while singing hymns.</t319> <t320>She could both smile and cry at the same time, and as her voice climbed effortlessly to the highest notes, a few tears would gracefully trickle down her cheek, as if queued up.</t320> <t321>Her involvement in other matters came after this.</t321>
<t322>The woman sitting in front of me was Serena Joy.</t322> <t323>Or at least she used to be.</t323> <t324>This was worse than I thought, it seemed.</t324>
<t325>4</t325>
<t326>I'm walking on the gravel path that divides the backyard lawn as straight as a parting line in hair.</t326> <t327>It rained all night: the grass on both sides of the path is wet, the air is humid.</t327> <t328>Here and there are worms, evidence of the soil's fertility, half-dead worms hunted by the sun; flexible and pink, like lips.</t328>
<t329>After opening the white wooden gate and crossing the lawn, I continue towards the front door.</t329> <t330>In the driveway, a Guardian assigned to our house is washing the car.</t330> <t331>This must mean that the Commander is at home, in his own quarters where he seems to spend most of his time, beyond the dining room.</t331>
<t332>This is a very expensive car, a Whirlwind; better than the Chariot, and much better than the stubby, practical Behemoth.</t332> <t333>Of course, its color is black too, the color of power or a hearse, and it is also long and shiny.</t333> <t334>The driver, with a piece of chamois in his hand, is lovingly wiping the car.</t334> <t335>At least this hasn't changed, the way men love good cars.</t335>
<t336>He is wearing a guard's uniform, but he has pushed his hat back in a flamboyant manner and rolled up his shirt to his elbows, exposing his sunburned, dark-haired arms.</t336> <t337>There is a cigarette in the corner of his mouth, indicating that he also has something he can trade on the black market.</t337>
<t338>I know this man's name: Nick.</t338> <t339>I know because I heard Rita and Cora talking about him, and once I heard the Commander call out to him: Nick, I won't need the car.</t339>
<t340>Here, at home, he stays above the garage.</t340> <t341>Low status: He hasn't been assigned a woman, not even one.</t341> <t342>No value: This must be some kind of flaw, a lack of relationship.</t342> <t343>But he acts as if he doesn't know or doesn't care.</t343> <t344>Extremely indifferent, but not very proud.</t344> <t345>It could be stupidity, but I don't think so.</t345> <t346>They used to say he smells like stale fish; or I smell a rat.</t346> <t347>A strange smell.</t347> <t348>I can't help thinking about how I might smell.</t348> <t349>Neither fish nor rotting rat, but a sun-sweated, smoke-covered burnt skin.</t349> <t350>I take a deep breath and sigh.</t350>
<t351>He looks at me and sees that I am looking at him.</t351> <t352>The face of a Frenchman: thin, frivolous, flat and angular, the lines that appear around his mouth when he smiles.</t352> <t353>He takes one last puff from his cigarette, throws it on the ground and steps on it, starts playing the click.</t353> <t354>Then he winks.</t354>
<t355>I lower my head and turn it so that the white wings cover my face, and I keep walking.</t355> <t356>He put himself in danger, but why?</t356> <t357>Well, what if I had reported him?</t357>
<t358>Maybe he was just being friendly.</t358> <t359>Maybe he saw the look on my face and misinterpreted it.</t359> <t360>Actually, what I wanted was a cigarette.</t360>
<t361>Maybe this was a test, to see what I would do.</t361>
<t362>Maybe it is an Eye.</t362>
<t363>With my head bowed, I open the front door without looking back and close it behind me.</t363> <t364>The sidewalk is paved with red bricks.</t364> <t365>This is the scene I focus my attention on: A rectangular area that gently undulates where the soil beneath has warped over centuries due to winter frost.</t365> <t366>The color of the bricks is faded, but still vibrant and clear.</t366> <t367>The sidewalks are being cleaned better than before.</t367>
<t368>I walk to the corner and wait.</t368> <t369>I used to be bad at waiting.</t369> <t370>They even serve those who just stand and wait, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t370> <t371>She had made us memorize this.</t371> <t372>And, some of you won't be able to endure it, she would also say.</t372> <t373>Some of you will fall on hard ground or onto thorns.</t373> <t374>Some of you have weak roots.</t374> <t375>She had a mole above her chin that moved up and down when she spoke.</t375> <t376>Consider yourselves seeds, she would say, and at that moment her voice would turn deceptive, conspiratorial; just like the voices of women teaching ballet to children and saying, let's imagine we are trees, with arms raised.</t376>
<t377>I'm standing in the corner, assuming that I am a tree.</t377>
<t378>A figure; a red figure resembling me, with white wings surrounding its face, carrying a basket, in red, an indescribable woman is coming towards me from the sidewalk.</t378> <t379>She reaches me and we glance at each other's faces, looking through the tunnels of white fabric that surround us.</t379> <t380>The right person.</t380>
<t381>"May God bless the fruit," he says to me, this is the approved greeting word between us.</t381>
<t382>“May God clear your way,” I reply, the approved response.</t382> <t383>We turn and walk together towards the city center, passing the large houses.</t383> <t384>We are not allowed to go there except in pairs.</t384> <t385>It is thought that this is done for our protection, but that is a ridiculous notion, we are already well protected.</t385> <t386>The truth is, he is my spy, and I am his.</t386> <t387>If one of us slips out of the cage due to an incident during one of our daily walks, the other will be held responsible.</t387>
<t388>This woman has been my walking companion for two weeks.</t388> <t389>I don't know what happened to the one before her.</t389> <t390>One day, she just wasn't there anymore, and this woman had come in her place.</t390> <t391>This is not an event you can ask questions about, because the answers are usually not the ones you want to hear.</t391> <t392>Anyway, there couldn't have been an answer.</t392>
<t393>This woman is a bit chubbier than me.</t393> <t394>Her eyes are brown.</t394> <t395>Her name is Gleninki, that's all I know about her.</t395> <t396>With dignity, head bowed, hands clasped in front with red gloves, she walks in short, small steps like a trained pig walking on its hind legs.</t396> <t397>In these walks, she never said anything completely against beliefs, but on the other hand, neither did I.</t397> <t398>She could be a true believer, a Handmaid beyond her name.</t398> <t399>I cannot take this risk.</t399>
<t400>“I heard the war is going well,” he says.</t400>
<t401>“Thank goodness,” I reply.</t401>
<t402>“God has sent us beautiful weather.</t402><t403>”</t403>
<t404>“I welcome it with happiness.</t404><t405>”</t405>
<t406>“They have dealt with a few more of the rebels since yesterday.</t406><t407>”</t407>
<t408>“Thank goodness,” I say.</t408> <t409>I don't ask how he learned this.</t409> <t410>“Who are they?</t410><t411>”</t411>
<t412>“The Baptists.</t412> <t413>They are based in the Blue Mountains.</t413> <t414>They have been driven out of their dens.</t414><t415>”</t415>
<t416>“Thank goodness.</t416><t417>”</t417>
<t418>Sometimes I just want it to be quiet and let me walk in peace.</t418> <t419>But I am hungry for news, all kinds of news; even if they are lies, they must have some meaning too.</t419>
<t420>We reached the first barrier, resembling those set up during hurdle races or infrastructure excavations: yellow and black striped cross planks, a red hexagon meaning Stop.</t420> <t421>At the gate, there are a few lanterns that are not yet lit because it is not night.</t421> <t422>Above us, I know there are spotlights mounted on telephone poles used in emergencies, and on both sides of the road, there are men with machine guns in the huts.</t422> <t423>I don't see the spotlights and huts because the wings beside my face obstruct me.</t423> <t424>I just know they are there.</t424>
<t425>Behind the barrier, in the narrow passage, there are two men waiting for us, wearing the green uniforms of the Guardians of Faith, with the insignia on their shoulders and their berets: two swords crossed on a white triangle.</t425> <t426>The Guardians are not real soldiers.</t426> <t427>They are used for routine policing and other menial tasks, such as digging the Commander's Wife's garden; they are either fools or old, or crippled or very young, except for the Eyes who roam in disguise.</t427>
<t428>These two are very young: one hasn't even started to grow a mustache, and the other's face is still covered in pimples.</t428> <t429>Their youth is touching, but I am aware that this cannot deceive me.</t429> <t430>Young Guards are usually the most dangerous, the most fanatical, and the quickest to draw their weapons.</t430> <t431>They have not yet learned how to exist over time.</t431> <t432>One must approach them with caution.</t432>
<t433>Last week, they shot a woman, right here.</t433> <t434>She was a Martha.</t434> <t435>She was searching for her pass in her dress, they thought she was reaching for a bomb.</t435> <t436>They thought it was a man dressed as a woman.</t436> <t437>These kinds of incidents have always happened.</t437>
<t438>Rita and Cora knew the woman.</t438> <t439>I had heard them talking about this event in the kitchen.</t439>
<t440>They are doing their jobs, said Cora.</t440> <t441>They are protecting us.</t441>
<t442>There is no one more trustworthy than a dead person, said Rita angrily.</t442> <t443>That woman was minding her own business.</t443> <t444>There was no reason to shoot her.</t444>
<t445>It was an accident, said Cora.</t445>
<t446>That can't happen, said Rita.</t446> <t447>Everything was arranged beforehand.</t447> <t448>I could hear the sounds she made while dealing with the dishes in the sink.</t448>
<t449>Yes, at the very least, someone will think twice before blowing up this house, said Cora.</t449>
<t450>No matter what, said Rita.</t450> <t451>She was working very hard.</t451> <t452>She did not deserve such a terrible death.</t452>
<t453>There is something worse, said Cora.</t453> <t454>At least it was a quick death.</t454>
<t455>Yes, that can be said, said Rita.</t455> <t456>I would like to have a little time.</t456> <t457>To get things in order.</t457>
<t458>Two young Guards salute us by touching the edges of their berets with three fingers.</t458> <t459>We have such privileges.</t459> <t460>Due to the nature of our service, they are required to show us respect.</t460>
<t461>We take out our transit documents from the zippered wallets located in the wide sleeves of our robes, they inspect and stamp them.</t461> <t462>One of the men enters the booth on the right to input our numbers into the Compüçek.</t462>
<t463>While returning my document, he tilts his head to look at me, with his peach-colored mustache.</t463> <t464>To help him, I lift my head a little and he sees my eyes, and I see his, he blushes.</t464> <t465>His face is as long and sad as a sheep's, but his eyes are like those of a terrier, no, a spaniel's, wide open and large.</t465> <t466>His skin has a pale and unhealthy delicate appearance, just like the skin under a wound.</t466> <t467>Yet I want to put my hand on it, this defenseless face.</t467> <t468>He is the one who looks away.</t468>
<t469>This is an event, a small defiance of the rules, so small it won't be noticed, but such moments are rewards I keep for myself; like hidden candies, when I was a child, at the back of a drawer.</t469> <t470>These kinds of moments are opportunities, tiny peepholes.</t470>
<t471>What if I came to this young man at night while he was alone on duty - even though such solitude would not be granted to him - and left him under my white wings?</t471><t472>What if I took off my red shroud and showed myself to him, to them, in the uncertain light of the lanterns?</t472><t473>This must be what they think about as they stand forever beside this barrier, where no one passes except for the Commanders of the Faithful with their long, black, humming cars, the blue Wives and white-veiled girls for the Salvation and Prayer Ceremonies, the stout green Marthas, and occasionally the Birthmobile or the red Handmaids walking on foot.</t473><t474>Although sometimes a van painted black, with a white-winged eye on one side, passes by.</t474><t475>The windows of the vans are dark-tinted, and the men sitting in the front seats wear dark glasses: double uncertainty.</t475>
<t476>Minibuses are definitely quieter than other cars.</t476> <t477>When they pass by, we turn our eyes in another direction.</t477> <t478>If there are sounds coming from inside, we try not to hear them.</t478> <t479>No one's heart is perfect.</t479>
<t480>When the black vans arrive at a checkpoint, they are waved through without stopping.</t480> <t481>The guards do not want to risk looking inside, searching, or questioning their authority.</t481> <t482>No matter what their thoughts may be.</t482>
<t483>If they are thinking He, you cannot understand this by looking at their faces.</t483>
<t484>But surely they are not thinking in terms of clothes thrown on the grass.</t484> <t485>Even if they think of a kiss, they must immediately think of the burning spotlights and rifle shots afterwards.</t485> <t486>Instead, they are thinking of doing their duties and being promoted to Angelhood, maybe getting marriage leave, and then, if they can gain enough power and live long enough, being assigned a Handmaid.</t486>
<t487>The one with the mustache opens the small pedestrian gate for us and stays back, stepping aside quite a bit; we pass through the gate.</t487> <t488>I know they are watching us as we move away; these two men who are not yet allowed to touch women.</t488> <t489>Instead, they touch with their eyes, I sway my hips a little, feeling the long red skirt swaying.</t489> <t490>It's like making a face from behind a fence or teasing a dog with a bone from a distance; I feel ashamed of myself for doing this, because none of this is their fault, they are very young.</t490>
<t491>Then I realize that I am not ashamed at all.</t491> <t492>I like power; the power of a dog’s bone, passive but there it is.</t492> <t493>I hope they get aroused when they see us and have to secretly rub themselves against the painted barriers.</t493> <t494>They will suffer later, at night, in their beds aligned in perfect order.</t494> <t495>Now they have no means of release other than themselves, and even that is considered a kind of sin.</t495> <t496>There are no magazines, films, or anything else to take their place anymore; just me and my shadow, moving away from those two men who are carefully watching our upright and departing forms at the barrier.</t496>
<t497>5</t497>
<t498>Paired up, I am walking on the road.</t498> <t499>Even though we are now in the Commanders' compound, there are still large houses here.</t499> <t500>In front of one of the houses, a Guardian is mowing the lawn.</t500> <t501>The lawns are clean, they look cute, well-maintained; they resemble the beautiful pictures once published in magazines about houses, gardens, and interior decoration.</t501> <t502>Here too, there is the same absence of people, the same state of dormancy.</t502> <t503>The street is almost like a museum or a street in model towns built to show how people used to live.</t503> <t504>Just like in those pictures, those museums, those model towns, there are no children around.</t504>
<t505>This is the heart of Gilead, a place where the war cannot force its way in except on television.</t505> <t506>We are not sure where the borders are, they constantly change according to attacks and counterattacks, but this is the center, where nothing moves.</t506> <t507>The Republic of Gilead, Aunt Lydia would say, knows no bounds.</t507> <t508>Gilead is within you.</t508>
<t509>Doctors used to live here, lawyers, university professors.</t509> <t510>Now there are no lawyers and the university is closed.</t510>
<t511>Luke and I used to walk these streets from time to time.</t511> <t512>We would talk about buying a house like these, a big old house, and fixing it up.</t512> <t513>We would have a garden, with swings for the children.</t513> <t514>We would have children.</t514> <t515>Even though we knew it was unlikely we could manage it, it was something to talk about.</t515> <t516>A Sunday game.</t516> <t517>Such freedom is now unthinkable.</t517>
<t518>We turn the corner that opens onto a main street, where the traffic is heavier.</t518> <t519>Cars are passing by, most of them black, some gray and brown.</t519> <t520>There are other women with baskets too, some in red, some in the dull green of the Marthas; some are wearing striped dresses, red and blue and green and cheap and tattered, these mark the wives of poorer men.</t520> <t521>They are called Econowives.</t521> <t522>These women have no separate functions.</t522> <t523>They have to do everything; if they can.</t523> <t524>Sometimes a woman entirely in black passes by, a widow.</t524> <t525>There used to be many of them, but they seem to be decreasing in number.</t525>
<t526>You cannot see the Commanders' wives on the sidewalk.</t526> <t527>They are only inside cars.</t527>
<t528>The sidewalks here are made of concrete.</t528> <t529>Just like a child, I take care not to step on the cracked spots.</t529> <t530>I remember my feet walking on these sidewalks, in the past, what I was wearing on my feet.</t530> <t531>Sometimes running shoes, the kind with cushioned soles and air holes, with stars made of phosphorescent fabric that reflects light in the dark.</t531> <t532>Though I never ran at night, and only during the day on crowded streets.</t532>
<t533>At that time, women were not yet protected.</t533>
<t534>I remember the rules, the rules never spoken but known by every woman: never open your door to a stranger, even if they say they are the police.</t534> <t535>Ask them to slide their ID card under the door.</t535> <t536>Do not stop on the road to help a motorcyclist claiming to have a problem.</t536> <t537>Hold yourself together and keep walking.</t537> <t538>If someone whistles, do not look back.</t538> <t539>Do not go to a laundromat alone at night.</t539>
<t540>I'm thinking about laundromats.</t540> <t541>What wouldn't I wear when going there: shorts, jeans, running pants.</t541> <t542>What wouldn't I put in the machines: my own clothes, my own soap, my own money, the money I earned on my own.</t542> <t543>I'm thinking about having such control.</t543>
<t544>Now we are walking on the same street, in red pairs, no man catcalls, talks to us, or touches us.</t544> <t545>No one whistles.</t545>
<t546>There are multiple types of freedom, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t546> <t547>The freedom to do things and the freedom to refrain from things.</t547> <t548>In the days of anarchy, there was the freedom to do things.</t548> <t549>Now you are given the freedom to refrain.</t549> <t550>Do not underestimate this.</t550>
<t551>On our right ahead, there is the shop where we ordered the clothes.</t551> <t552>Some people call these habits, a fitting phrase.</t552> <t553>It is difficult to break habits.</t553> <t554>Outside the shop, there is a large wooden sign hanging, in the shape of a golden lily; it is called the Field Lily.</t554> <t555>Under the lily, you can see where the letters were covered with paint, at that time they had decided that even shop names were too enticing for us.</t555> <t556>Now, such places are only known by their signboards without writing.</t556>
<t557>Zambaklar used to be a cinema.</t557> <t558>Students would often go there.</t558> <t559>Every spring, a Humphrey Bogart festival was organized, featuring Lauren Bacall or Katherine Hepburn, women who made their own decisions independently.</t559> <t560>They would wear blouses with buttons all the way down, hinting at the possibilities of the word "naked".</t560> <t561>These women could be stripped or not stripped.</t561> <t562>Apparently, they had the right to choose.</t562> <t563>Back then, we also seemed to have the ability to choose.</t563> <t564>We were a society on the brink of death, Aunt Lydia would say, because of too many choices.</t564>
<t565>I don't know when they gave up organizing the festival.</t565> <t566>I must have grown up.</t566> <t567>That's why I didn't notice.</t567>
<t568>We avoid the lilies and cross the street, turning into a side alley.</t568> <t569>Our first stop is another shop with a wooden sign: three eggs, a moment, a cow.</t569> <t570>Milk and Honey.</t570> <t571>There's a line, we wait our turn, two by two.</t571> <t572>I notice that oranges have arrived today.</t572> <t573>Since Central America was lost to the Libertarians, finding oranges has become difficult, sometimes they are available, sometimes not.</t573> <t574>The war also interferes with California oranges, and when there are roadblocks or the railways are blown up, even Florida is not reliable.</t574> <t575>I look at the oranges, desiring one.</t575> <t576>But I didn't bring a ration card for oranges.</t576> <t577>I think about going back and telling Rita about this.</t577> <t578>She will be delighted.</t578> <t579>Getting an orange would be something, a small success.</t579>
<t580>Those who reach the counter hand their ration cards to the two men in Guardian uniforms standing on the other side.</t580> <t581>There is hardly anyone speaking, though there are whispers, and the women are turning their heads slyly from one side to the other: this is a place of commerce, a place where you might see someone you know, from before or from the Red Center.</t581> <t582>Even catching a glimpse of a familiar face is encouraging.</t582> <t583>Oh, if only I could see Moira, just see her, know that she still exists.</t583> <t584>Now, it is very difficult to even imagine having a friend.</t584>
<t585>But Gleninki, next to me, is not looking around.</t585> <t586>Maybe he doesn't recognize anyone anymore.</t586> <t587>Maybe all the women he knew are gone.</t587> <t588>Or maybe he doesn't want to be seen.</t588> <t589>He stands silently, head bowed.</t589>
<t590>While we are waiting in our double line, the door opens and two more women enter, both dressed in the red dresses and white wings of the Handmaids.</t590> <t591>One of them is heavily pregnant, her belly prominently swollen under her loose dress.</t591> <t592>There is a stir in the room, a whispering, a collective exhale; involuntarily, we turn our heads, roughly, to see better; our fingers itch to touch her.</t592> <t593>To us, she is a magical being, an object of envy and desire, we envy her.</t593> <t594>She is the flag on the peak, showing us what can still be done: we too can be saved.</t594>
<t595>The women in the room are whispering, almost talking, their excitement is so great.</t595>
<t596>“Who is it?” I hear being said behind me.</t596>
<t597>"Where are you?"</t597> <t598>"Here."</t598> <t599>"Where are you, Warren?"</t599><t600>"</t600>
<t601>“Show-off,” hisses a voice, and it's true.</t601> <t602>A woman whose pregnancy is this advanced doesn't need to go out or do shopping.</t602> <t603>Daily walks are no longer necessary for her abdominal muscles to work well.</t603> <t604>She only needs floor exercises, breathing exercises.</t604> <t605>She could stay at home.</t605> <t606>Besides, being outside is dangerous for her; there should be a Guardian waiting outside the door.</t606> <t607>Now that she is a life carrier, she is closer to death and needs special protection.</t607> <t608>Jealousy can reach her; it has happened before.</t608> <t609>Now all children are wanted, but not by everyone.</t609>
<t610>However, this walk might be one of her whims, they yield to whims when pregnancy is this advanced and there is no miscarriage.</t610> <t611>Or maybe she is one of them, Load more, I can carry; a martyr.</t611> <t612>When she lifts her head to look around, I see her face for a moment.</t612> <t613>The voice behind me was right.</t613> <t614>She came to show herself.</t614> <t615>She blushes bright pink, enjoying every moment of it.</t615>
<t616>"Silence," says one of the Guards behind the counter, and we fall silent like schoolgirls.</t616>
<t617>Gleninki and I reached the counter.</t617> <t618>We hand over our ration cards and while one Guard gives us the milk and eggs we requested, the other enters the numbers into the Compubite.</t618> <t619>We put what we received into our baskets and go back outside, passing by the pregnant woman and her partner, next to the woman who is hunched over like a stork; just like all of us.</t619> <t620>The pregnant woman's belly looks like a very large fruit.</t620> <t621>Humungous, a word from my childhood.</t621> <t622>Her hands rest on her belly, as if she wants to protect it or gather something from it, warmth and strength, perhaps.</t622>
<t623>As she walks by, she looks directly into my eyes, and I remember who she is.</t623> <t624>We were together at the Red Center, she was one of Aunt Lydia's favorites.</t624> <t625>I never liked her.</t625> <t626>In the previous time, her name was Janine.</t626>
<t627>Janine is looking at me and the lines of a smirk are forming at the corners of her mouth.</t627> <t628>She is looking at the place where my stomach remains flat under the dress and the wings are covering my face.</t628> <t629>I can only see a small part of her forehead and the pinkish tip of her nose.</t629>
<t630>Our next stop is Bilumum Etler, whose sign consists of a large wooden pork chop hanging from two chains.</t630> <t631>There isn't such a long queue here; meat is expensive.</t631> <t632>Even the commanders can't get it every day.</t632> <t633>Gleninki is getting steak, though, for the second time this week.</t633> <t634>I'll tell the Marthas about this.</t634> <t635>This is the kind of thing they like to hear.</t635> <t636>They are very interested in how things are run in other households; these kinds of trivial gossip pieces give them a chance to feel pride or discontent.</t636>
<t637>I'm taking the chicken wrapped in butcher paper and tied with string.</t637> <t638>There isn't much left that's plastic anymore.</t638> <t639>I remember the endless white plastic shopping bags from the supermarket; I hated throwing them away and would stuff them under the sink until the days when they multiplied so much that they would burst out and scatter all over the floor when I opened the cabinet door.</t639> <t640>Luke used to complain about this.</t640> <t641>He would periodically gather all the bags and throw them out.</t641>
<t642>The girl could take one of these and put it on her head, she would say.</t642> <t643>You know how much children love to play.</t643> <t644>She would never do that, I would say.</t644> <t645>She's grown up now.</t645> <t646>(Or very smart or very lucky.</t646><t647>)</t647> <t648>But I would shiver with fear, and then feel guilty for being so careless.</t648> <t649>It was true, I used to accept many things as they were; I trusted fate back then.</t649> <t650>I will store them in a higher cabinet, I would say.</t650> <t651>Never store them, she would say.</t651> <t652>We don't use them for anything.</t652> <t653>Garbage bags, I would say.</t653> <t654>And she would say...</t654>
<t655>It cannot be here and now.</t655> <t656>It cannot be in a place where people are watching.</t656> <t657>I turn around, I see my silhouette in the monolithic glass display.</t657> <t658>So we have gone outside, we are on the street.</t658>
<t659>A group of people is coming towards us.</t659> <t660>Tourists, apparently from Japan, perhaps a trade delegation, on a historical sites tour or exploring local life.</t660> <t661>They stand out immediately because they are petite; each has their own camera, their own smile.</t661> <t662>They are looking around, with bright eyes, lifting their heads like thrushes, with aggressive cheerfulness; I can't help but watch them.</t662> <t663>It's been a long time since I've seen women wearing such short skirts.</t663> <t664>The skirt length is just below the knee, revealing their legs at the end, almost bare in thin stockings, daring, with high-heeled shoes tied to their feet like elegant torture devices.</t664> <t665>The women are wobbling on their spiked shoes as if on stilts; their backs arched outward at the waist, pushing their hips out.</t665> <t666>The women's heads are uncovered, displaying their hair in all its blackness and sexuality.</t666> <t667>They have put on red lipstick, defining the moist hollows of their mouths, just like graffiti on a toilet wall from earlier times.</t667>
<t668>I give up on walking.</t668> <t669>Glen's also stops beside me, and I know he can't take his eyes off these women either.</t669> <t670>We are mesmerized, but also disgusted.</t670> <t671>They are almost naked.</t671> <t672>It didn't take long for us to change our minds about these kinds of things.</t672>
<t673>Then I think: I used to dress like this too.</t673> <t674>This was freedom.</t674>
<t675>They used to call this Westernized in the past.</t675>
<t676>Japanese tourists are chirping as they come towards us, and we are too late to turn our heads in another direction: our faces have already been seen.</t676>
<t677>There is a translator with them, dressed in a standard blue suit and red tie, with a tie pin featuring a winged eye.</t677> <t678>He separates from the group and steps in front of us, blocking our path.</t678> <t679>The tourists cluster behind him; one of them raises a camera.</t679>
<t680>“Excuse me,” he says to both of us, politely enough.</t680> <t681>“They are asking if they can take a photo of you.</t681><t682>”</t682>
<t683>I'm looking at the sidewalk and shaking my head to mean No.</t683> <t684>The only things they should see are the white wings, part of the face, my chin, and part of my mouth.</t684> <t685>Never the eyes.</t685> <t686>I'm smart enough not to look at the translator's face.</t686> <t687>Most translators are Eyes or so it is said.</t687>
<t688>I'm smart enough not to say yes.</t688> <t689>Aunt Lydia used to say that humility is invisibility.</t689> <t690>Never forget this.</t690> <t691>To be seen - her voice trembled as she said it - is to be reachable.</t691> <t692>What you need to be, girls, is unreachable.</t692> <t693>She used to call us girls.</t693>
<t694>Glen's is also silent beside me.</t694> <t695>She has tucked her red-gloved hands into the sleeves of her dress to hide them.</t695>
<t696>The translator turns back to the group and chatters in short, broken sentences.</t696> <t697>I know what he's going to say, I know his line.</t697> <t698>He will explain that the women here have different traditions, and that looking at them through the lens of a camera would be considered, according to them, as an act of violation.</t698>
<t699>I'm looking down at the sidewalk, hypnotized by the women's feet.</t699> <t700>One of them is wearing sandals that leave her toes exposed, and her nails are painted pink.</t700> <t701>I remember the smell of nail polish, how it wrinkles when you apply the second coat too early, the satiny touch of thin pantyhose, and what toes feel like when they are pushed into the openness of the shoe with the whole weight of the body.</t701> <t702>The woman with the nail polish shifts her weight from one foot to the other.</t702> <t703>I can feel her shoes on my own feet.</t703> <t704>The smell of the nail polish made me hungry.</t704>
<t705>“Excuse me,” says the translator again, to get our attention.</t705> <t706>I nod to show that I heard him.</t706>
<t707>“This man is asking if you are happy,” says the translator.</t707> <t708>I can imagine their curiosity: Are they happy?</t708> <t709>How can they be happy?</t709> <t710>I can feel their dark open eyes on us, how they leaned in just a moment ago to catch our answers, especially the women, but also the men: We are a mystery to them, forbidden, something that excites them.</t710>
<t711>Gleninki doesn't say anything.</t711> <t712>Silence.</t712> <t713>But sometimes not speaking is equally dangerous.</t713>
<t714>“Yes, we are very happy,” I murmur.</t714> <t715>I have to say something.</t715> <t716>What else can I say?</t716>
<t717>6</t717>
<t718>After a block from Bilumum Etler, Gleninki pauses, as if unsure which way to go.</t718> <t719>We have an option.</t719> <t720>We can either turn back directly or take the long way around.</t720> <t721>We already know which way we will prefer, because we always go that way.</t721>
<t722>“I would like to pass through the church,” says Gleninki, as if devout.</t722>
<t723>“Okay,” I say, although I know just as well as he does what he is truly after.</t723>
<t724>We are walking, in tranquility.</t724> <t725>The sun has risen, there are white fluffy clouds in the sky, resembling headless sheep.</t725> <t726>With our wings, with our blinders, it is hard to look up, hard to see the sky, or anything completely.</t726> <t727>But we can do this for a moment, with a quick movement of the head up and down, sideways and backward.</t727> <t728>We have learned to see the world in fleeting moments.</t728>
<t729>On the right, if you can walk, there is a street that will take you to the river.</t729> <t730>There is a boathouse where once there were boats and a few bridges; also trees, green boats where you could watch bare-armed men lifting their oars towards the sun to win.</t730> <t731>On the way to the river, there are old student dormitories, now used for other purposes, with their fairy-tale towers, painted white, gold, and blue.</t731> <t732>The things we choose to remember from the past are the beautiful ones.</t732> <t733>We want to believe that everything was like this.</t733>
<t734>The stadium where the Male Liberation Ceremonies are held is also there.</t734> <t735>Additionally, football matches are also held here.</t735> <t736>They are still continuing these.</t736>
<t737>I'm no longer going to the river or crossing the bridges.</t737> <t738>Or taking the metro, even though there's a station right there.</t738> <t739>We are not allowed to use them anymore, there are Guards there now, because we have no official reason to descend these steps and take the trains under the river to the main city.</t739> <t740>Why would we want to go from here to there?</t740> <t741>Our intentions couldn't be good, and they would understand that.</t741>
<t742>The church is small, one of the first built here, hundreds of years ago.</t742> <t743>It is no longer in use, except as a museum.</t743> <t744>Inside, you can see pictures of women dressed in long, somber dresses with their hair covered by white headscarves, and men standing rigidly in dark clothes, not smiling.</t744> <t745>Our ancestors.</t745> <t746>Entrance is free.</t746>
<t747>We do not go inside, still standing on the path, looking at the church cemetery.</t747> <t748>The old tombstones are still standing there, changed and worn by the weather, with their skulls and crossbones, memento mori, their dough-faced angels, winged hourglasses reminding us that mortal time has passed, and from a later century, urns and willow trees, for mourning.</t748>
<t749>They neither touched the tombstones nor the church.</t749> <t750>What disturbed them was more recent history.</t750>
<t751>Gleninki's head is bowed, as if she is praying.</t751> <t752>She does this every time.</t752> <t753>Maybe, I think, there is someone, a special someone who is gone, for her: a man, a child.</t753> <t754>But I can't really believe it.</t754> <t755>I think of her as a woman who does everything for show, acting more than behaving naturally.</t755> <t756>I think she does these kinds of things to look good.</t756> <t757>She tries to make the most of them.</t757>
<t758>But I must appear this way to him as well.</t758> <t759>How could it be otherwise?</t759>
<t760>Now we turn our backs to the church and here it is, the thing we actually came to see: The Wall.</t760>
<t761>The wall is also centuries old; or at least over a century.</t761> <t762>Like the sidewalks, it is made of red brick, once simple yet beautiful.</t762> <t763>Now there are guards at the doors and ugly new spotlights have been installed with metal supports on top; barbed wire runs along the wall and broken glass embedded in concrete on top.</t763>
<t764>No one enters through these doors willingly.</t764> <t765>The precautions are for those trying to get out; although, getting past the electronic alarm system and reaching the Wall from the inside is beyond impossible.</t765>
<t766>Six more bodies are hanging by their necks next to the main door; their hands tied in front of them, their heads resting on their shoulders inside white bags.</t766> <t767>The Men's Salvation Ceremony must have been held early this morning.</t767> <t768>I didn't hear the bells.</t768> <t769>Maybe I've gotten used to them.</t769>
<t770>As if on a signal, we stand together and look at the bodies.</t770> <t771>There is no harm in looking.</t771> <t772>In fact, we are expected to do so: that is why they are there, hanging on the wall.</t772> <t773>Sometimes they stay there for days, until a new group arrives, so that as many people as possible have a chance to see them.</t773>
<t774>They are hanging on hooks.</t774> <t775>The hooks were placed on the bricks of the Wall for this purpose.</t775> <t776>Not all of them are full.</t776> <t777>The hooks resemble prosthetics made for those without arms.</t777> <t778>Or like steel question marks, inverted and tilted.</t778>
<t779>The worst are the bags over their heads, worse than the shapes their faces could take.</t779> <t780>The men's faces resemble unpainted dolls; like scarecrows, in a way, because their purpose is to frighten.</t780> <t781>Or their heads are like sacks filled with an indistinguishable material, like flour or dough.</t781> <t782>The distinct weight, the emptiness of the heads, is created by gravity pulling them down, there is no vital force to keep them upright anymore.</t782> <t783>These heads are zero.</t783>
<t784>If you look repeatedly like we did, you can see the outlines of faces under the white cloth, like gray shadows.</t784> <t785>The heads are the heads of snowmen with fallen coal eyes and carrot noses.</t785> <t786>The heads are melting.</t786>
<t787>However, in the place where the mouth should be, there is a bloodstain that has seeped through the white fabric on one of the bags.</t787> <t788>It forms another mouth, a small red mouth, like the mouths painted with thick brushes by kindergarten children.</t788> <t789>A child's conception of a smile.</t789> <t790>In the end, it is this smile made of blood that draws attention.</t790> <t791>These are not snowmen, after all.</t791>
<t792>The men are in white coats, just like the kind doctors or scientists wear.</t792> <t793>It's not just doctors and scientists who are hanged here, there are others too, but they must have caught these ones this morning.</t793> <t794>Each one has a placard around their neck showing why they were executed: a drawing of a fetus.</t794> <t795>So they were doctors, in the past, when this kind of procedure was legal.</t795> <t796>They were called angel makers: or was it something else?</t796> <t797>Now they've been uncovered during the examination of hospital records or, more accurately, when it was understood what would happen, since most hospitals destroyed these records, by informers: perhaps an old nurse or two nurses, because the testimony of a single woman is no longer accepted; maybe another doctor hoping to save themselves or someone already accused, betraying an enemy or making a desperate attempt for their own safety.</t797> <t798>Though informers are not always forgiven.</t798>
<t799>We were told that these men were like war criminals.</t799> <t800>The fact that what they did was legal at the time could not be considered an excuse: their crimes concern both the past and the present.</t800> <t801>They did evil and should serve as an example to the rest.</t801> <t802>Though this may not be very necessary.</t802> <t803>Nowadays, no sane woman who has had the chance to conceive would try to prevent a birth.</t803>
<t804>The expected feelings towards these bodies are hatred and anger.</t804> <t805>However, I do not feel these.</t805> <t806>The bodies hanging on the wall are time travelers, mistakes of history.</t806> <t807>They came here from the past.</t807>
<t808>The emptiness I feel towards them.</t808> <t809>What I feel, something I shouldn't feel.</t809> <t810>What I feel is partly relief, because none of these men are Luke.</t810> <t811>Luke was not a doctor.</t811> <t812>Not.</t812>
<t813>I'm looking at that red smile.</t813> <t814>The red of the smile is the red of the tulips in Serena Joy's garden, the red at the base of the flowers where they start to heal.</t814> <t815>The color is the same but there is no connection between them.</t815> <t816>The tulips are not the tulips of blood, the red smiles are not flowers, none of them comment on the other.</t816> <t817>The tulip is not the reason for disbelief in the hanged man, nor is the reverse true.</t817> <t818>Each is precious and truly there.</t818> <t819>I must find my way through this field of precious objects, every day and in every form.</t819> <t820>I make great efforts to make such distinctions.</t820> <t821>I need to make them.</t821> <t822>I must be very clear in my own mind.</t822>
<t823>I feel the woman next to me trembling.</t823> <t824>Is she crying?</t824> <t825>How can this make her look good?</t825> <t826>I can't afford to find out.</t826> <t827>I realize that my hands are tightly gripping the handle of the basket.</t827> <t828>I won't reveal anything.</t828>
<t829>What you are accustomed to, Aunt Lydia would say, is ordinariness.</t829> <t830>This may not seem ordinary to you now, but after a while, it will appear ordinary.</t830> <t831>It will become ordinary.</t831>
<t832>III</t832>
<t833>Night</t833>
<t834>7</t834>
<t835>The night is mine, a time that belongs to me, I can use it as I wish, as long as I remain silent.</t835> <t836>As long as I do not move.</t836> <t837>As long as I lie still.</t837> <t838>The difference between lying down and being laid down.</t838> <t839>Being laid down is always passive: In the past, even men would say, I would like to be laid down.</t839> <t840>Yet sometimes, they would say, I would like to lay the girl down.</t840> <t841>All of this is purely speculation.</t841> <t842>I really don't know what men used to say.</t842> <t843>I only have the words.</t843>
<t844>Inside the room, under the plastered eye on the ceiling, behind the white curtains, among the sheets, as flat as they are, I am lying down, therefore, stepping outside my own time.</t844> <t845>Outside of time.</t845> <t846>Yet this is time, and I am not outside of it.</t846>
<t847>However, night is my time to go out.</t847> <t848>Where should I go?</t848>
<t849>To beautiful places.</t849>
<t850>At the end of my bed, with legs crossed, heel on her knee, in a purple jumpsuit, with a long earring in her ear, with nails painted gold to be quirky, holding a cigarette between her short fingers with yellow tips, Moira.</t850> <t851>Come on, let's go have a beer.</t851>
<t852>You are dropping ash on my bed, I said.</t852>
<t853>If you made your bed, there wouldn't be such a problem, said Moira.</t853>
<t854>In half an hour, I said.</t854> <t855>I had an assignment for the next day.</t855> <t856>What was it? Psychology, English, Economics.</t856> <t857>We used to read these kinds of things back then.</t857> <t858>In the room, there were books lying face down on the floor, scattered around wastefully.</t858>
<t859>Now, said Moira.</t859> <t860>You don't need to put on makeup, it's just me.</t860> <t861>What's the topic of your assignment?</t861> <t862>I just wrote one about date rapes recently.</t862>
<t863>I said, "Flirt rape."</t863> <t864>I see that you are quite fashionable.</t864> <t865>It sounds like a type of dessert.</t865> <t866>Flörtté cavüzé.</t866>
<t867>Ha, ha, said Moira.</t867> <t868>Take your jacket.</t868>
<t869>He took it and threw it towards me.</t869> <t870>I'm borrowing five dollars from you, okay?</t870>
<t871>Or maybe somewhere in the park, with my mother.</t871> <t872>How old was I?</t872> <t873>It was cold, our breaths were coming out in front of us as steam, there were no leaves on the trees; a gray sky, two ducks in the pond, sorrowful.</t873> <t874>Bread crumbs between my fingers in my pocket.</t874> <t875>Come on, we are going to feed the ducks, my mother said.</t875>
<t876>However, there were a few women burning books there; this was what my mother was truly after.</t876> <t877>Seeing her friends; she had lied to me, Saturdays were supposedly my day.</t877> <t878>I sulked away from her, towards the ducks, but the fire drew me to itself.</t878>
<t879>There were also a few men among the women, and what they were burning were magazines.</t879> <t880>They must have poured gasoline, because the flames were very high, then, making sure not to throw more than a few at a time, they started taking the magazines from the boxes and tossing them into the fire.</t880> <t881>Some were singing; spectators were gathering.</t881>
<t882>Their faces were happy, almost ecstatic.</t882> <t883>The fire can achieve this.</t883> <t884>Even my mother's usually pale, thin face looked flushed and cheerful, like a Christmas card; there was also a hefty woman with a sooty mark on her cheek and an orange knitted hat, I remember her.</t884>
<t885>"Would you like to throw one, darling?" he said.</t885> <t886>"How old was I?"</t886>
<t887>It's a good riddance for terrible trash, he said, chuckling.</t887> <t888>Is it okay? he turned to my mother.</t888>
<t889>If she wants, said my mother, she had a habit of talking about me with others as if I couldn't hear her.</t889>
<t890>The woman handed me one of the magazines.</t890> <t891>There was a beautiful woman on the cover, without clothes, wrapped in her hands and hanging from a chain suspended from the ceiling.</t891> <t892>I was looking at the magazine with interest.</t892> <t893>It didn't scare me.</t893> <t894>I was thinking she was swinging, like Tarzan swinging on a vine on television.</t894>
<t895>"Don't let anyone see," said my mother.</t895> <t896>"Here," she said to me, "throw it away, quickly."</t896>
<t897>I threw the magazine into the flames.</t897> <t898>As it burned, the pages opened in the wind, and the parts of the burning women's bodies turned into black ash before my eyes and began to fly in the air.</t898>
<t899>Well, what happens next, well, what happens next?</t899> <t900>I know I am losing time.</t900>
<t901>There must have been needles, pills, things like that.</t901> <t902>I couldn't have lost so much time without help.</t902> <t903>You were in shock, they said.</t903>
<t904>I came to myself with a roar and chaos like foaming waves.</t904> <t905>I can remember being very calm.</t905> <t906>My scream too, it seemed like a scream to me, but it could have been just a whisper, Where is he?</t906> <t907>What did you do to him?</t907>
<t908>There was neither night nor day; only a vibration.</t908> <t909>After a while, there were chairs again and a bed, and after that, a window.</t909>
<t910>They said, "He is in good hands."</t910> <t911>With the right people.</t911> <t912>You are not suitable, but you want the best for him, don't you?</t912>
<t913>They showed me a picture of him, outside on the grass, his face covered in an oval shape.</t913> <t914>His light-colored hair was tightly gathered at the back of his head.</t914> <t915>He was holding the hand of a woman I didn't know.</t915> <t916>He only came up to the woman's elbow.</t916>
<t917>You killed him, I said.</t917> <t918>He looked like an angel, serious, intense, made of air.</t918>
<t919>She was wearing a white dress that I had never seen before, reaching down to the ground.</t919>
<t920>I would like to believe that this is just a story I told.</t920> <t921>I need to believe this.</t921> <t922>I have to believe it.</t922> <t923>Those who can believe that such stories are just stories are luckier.</t923>
<t924>If this is a story I'm telling, then I can control its ending.</t924> <t925>Then the story will have an end, and real life will follow.</t925> <t926>I can continue from where I left off.</t926>
<t927>This is not a story I am telling.</t927>
<t928>This is a story I tell in my mind as long as I continue to live.</t928>
<t929>Rather than writing, because I have nothing to write with and writing is absolutely forbidden.</t929> <t930>However, if this is a story, even if it's in my head, I must be telling it to someone.</t930> <t931>You can't just tell a story to yourself.</t931> <t932>There is always someone else.</t932>
<t933>Even if there is no one.</t933>
<t934>A story is like a letter.</t934> <t935>I will say, Dear You.</t935> <t936>Just you, without a name.</t936> <t937>Giving a name ties you to the world of realities, this is riskier, more dangerous: out there, who knows what your chances of survival are?</t937> <t938>I will say you, you, like an old love song.</t938> <t939>You can mean more than one.</t939>
<t940>You can mean thousands.</t940>
<t941>I am not in immediate danger, I will tell you.</t941>
<t942>I will assume that you can hear me.</t942>
<t943>But it's useless, I know you won't be able to hear.</t943>
<t944>IV</t944>
<t945>Waiting Room</t945>
<t946>8</t946>
<t947>The beauty of the weather continues.</t947> <t948>Almost like those Junes when we would bring out our summer clothes and go get ice cream in a cone.</t948> <t949>Three new bodies are hanging on the Wall.</t949> <t950>One is a priest still wearing his black robe.</t950> <t951>They dressed him in it for the trial, even though they had stopped wearing them years ago when the sectarian wars first began; the robe made them immediately noticeable.</t951> <t952>The other two have purple placards around their necks: sexual betrayal.</t952> <t953>They still wear the Guardian uniforms on their bodies.</t953> <t954>They must have been caught together, but where?</t954> <t955>In the barracks, in the shower?</t955> <t956>It's hard to say.</t956> <t957>The snowman with the red smile is gone.</t957>
<t958>“We should go back,” I say to Gleninki.</t958> <t959>I'm always the one who says this.</t959> <t960>Sometimes it feels like if I don't say it, Gleninki would stay here forever.</t960> <t961>Is he mourning, or is he taking some devilish pleasure?</t961> <t962>I'm still not sure about that.</t962>
<t963>It seems to move with sound, as if on small oily wheels, as if it were on top of a music box, turning without saying a single word.</t963> <t964>I resent its elegance.</t964> <t965>I envy its meek head, as if bowed under a strong wind.</t965> <t966>But there is no wind at all.</t966>
<t967>We leave the wall and head back the way we came, under the warm sun.</t967>
<t968>“A beautiful May day,” says Gleninki.</t968> <t969>I feel rather than see her head turn, expecting an answer.</t969>
<t970>“That's right,” I say.</t970> <t971>“Thank God,” I add, as if it just occurred to me.</t971> <t972>Mayday was a distress signal used a long time ago, in one of those wars we studied in high school.</t972> <t973>I always mixed up those wars, but if you paid attention, it was possible to distinguish them by looking at their planes.</t973> <t974>It was Luke who told me about Mayday, though.</t974> <t975>Mayday, Mayday, for pilots whose planes were shot down and ships - did it apply to ships too? - hit at sea.</t975> <t976>Maybe the signal for ships was SOS.</t976> <t977>I wish I could look this up somewhere.</t977> <t978>And for the beginning of victory, in one of those wars, there was something from Beethoven too.</t978>
<t979>Do you know what the origin of Mayday is? said Luke.</t979>
<t980>No, I said.</t980> <t981>A strange word to use in such a situation, isn't it?</t981>
<t982>Newspapers and coffee, on Sunday mornings, before the girl was born.</t982> <t983>There were still newspapers back then.</t983> <t984>We used to read them in bed.</t984>
<t985>French, he said.</t985> <t986>It comes from 'M'aidez'.</t986>
<t987>Help me.</t987>
<t988>A small group is coming towards us, a funeral procession: three women, each with a transparent black veil thrown over their headdresses.</t988> <t989>An Econowife and two other women, mourners, they are also Econowives, perhaps her friends.</t989> <t990>Their striped dresses, like their faces, look worn out.</t990> <t991>One day, as time goes on, says Aunt Lydia, no one will have to be an Econowife.</t991>
<t992>The mother at the beginning, who has suffered a loss, is carrying a small black jar.</t992> <t993>From the size of the jar, it is possible to understand how many months old the baby was when it perished and passed into death inside it.</t993> <t994>Two or three months old, too small to determine if it was a Non-Baby.</t994> <t995>The larger ones and those who die at birth are placed in boxes.</t995>
<t996>We pause respectfully as they pass by us.</t996> <t997>I wonder if Gleninki feels the same way I do; a sharp pain, in the stomach.</t997> <t998>We place our hands over our hearts to show these foreign women that we share their pain.</t998> <t999>The woman at the front looks at us with a frown from under her veil.</t999> <t1000>One of the others turns aside and spits on the sidewalk.</t1000> <t1001>The Econowives do not like us.</t1001>
<t1002>We pass the shops and come back to the barrier, and we are allowed to pass.</t1002> <t1003>We pass in front of wide, empty-looking houses and through weedless lawns.</t1003> <t1004>At the corner near the house I was assigned to, Gleninki stops and turns to me.</t1004>
<t1005>“God Bless,” he says.</t1005> <t1006>A fitting farewell.</t1006>
<t1007>“God bless,” I reply, and he nods slightly, as if he is about to say something else, but then he turns and walks down the street.</t1007> <t1008>I watch him.</t1008> <t1009>Just like my own reflection in a mirror, moving away.</t1009>
<t1010>On the road, Nick is polishing Whirlwind again.</t1010> <t1011>He has reached the chrome plating at the back.</t1011> <t1012>I place my gloved hand on the door latch, open it, and push it inward.</t1012> <t1013>The door clicks shut behind me.</t1013> <t1014>The tulips at the edge of the garden are redder than ever, blooming, no longer like wine glasses but goblets; they push themselves upward, towards what purpose?</t1014> <t1015>Ultimately, they are empty.</t1015> <t1016>When they wither, their insides turn outwards, then they slowly burst, scattering petals like broken pottery pieces around.</t1016>
<t1017>Nick raises his head and starts whistling.</t1017> <t1018>Then he says, "Was the walk nice?"</t1018>
<t1019>I nod my head, but I do not respond with words.</t1019> <t1020>They should not speak to me.</t1020> <t1021>Of course, a few will try, Aunt Lydia would say.</t1021> <t1022>All bodies are weak.</t1022> <t1023>All bodies are grass, I corrected her in my mind.</t1023> <t1024>It is not in their hands, she would say, God created them this way, but He did not create you this way.</t1024> <t1025>He created you differently.</t1025> <t1026>It is up to you to set the boundaries.</t1026> <t1027>Then you will be appreciated.</t1027>
<t1028>The Commander's Wife is sitting in the chair she had brought out in the garden behind the house.</t1028><t1029>Serena Joy, what a stupid name.</t1029><t1030>In another time, in the previous time, it was like something you put on your hair to make it stand up.</t1030><t1031>Serena Joy, it would say on the bottle, with yellow scalloped edges, a silhouette of a woman's head cut out of paper on a pink oval background.</t1031><t1032>With a whole array of other name options, why did she choose this one?</t1032><t1033>Serena Joy was never her real name, even then.</t1033><t1034>Her real name was Pam.</t1034><t1035>I read this in a biography about her, in a news magazine, long after I first watched her sing while my mother slept on Sunday mornings.</t1035><t1036>At that time, she was important enough to have a biography written about her: It must have been in Time or Newsweek.</t1036><t1037>By then, she was no longer singing, she was giving speeches.</t1037><t1038>She was good at that too.</t1038><t1039>Her speeches were about the sanctity of the home, how women should stay at home.</t1039><t1040>Serena Joy herself wasn't doing that, instead, she was giving speeches, but she presented her own failure as a sacrifice made for the good of everyone.</t1040>
<t1041>At that time, someone tried to shoot him, but missed; instead, they killed the secretary standing right behind him.</t1041> <t1042>Additionally, someone else placed a bomb in his car, but the bomb exploded too early.</t1042> <t1043>However, according to some, he had placed the bomb in his car himself to garner sympathy.</t1043> <t1044>This is how things were heating up.</t1044>
<t1045>Luke and I would sometimes watch her on the midnight news.</t1045> <t1046>Robes, nightcaps.</t1046> <t1047>We would watch her sprayed hair, her hysteria, the tears she could shed at will, and the mascara that painted her cheeks black.</t1047> <t1048>She used to wear more makeup back then.</t1048> <t1049>We thought it was funny.</t1049> <t1050>Or at least Luke did.</t1050> <t1051>I just pretended to think so.</t1051> <t1052>In reality, it was a bit scary.</t1052> <t1053>She took her job too seriously.</t1053>
<t1054>He no longer gives speeches.</t1054> <t1055>He has stopped talking.</t1055> <t1056>He stays at home, but this doesn't seem to suit him.</t1056> <t1057>Now, he must be furious because they are taking him seriously.</t1057>
<t1058>He is looking at the tulips.</t1058> <t1059>His cane is beside him on the grass.</t1059> <t1060>His profile is turned towards me, I can see this with a brief sideways glance as I pass by.</t1060> <t1061>It wouldn't be right to look directly at him.</t1061> <t1062>It's no longer a perfect profile cut from paper, his face is collapsing inward, I think of those cities built over underground rivers that suddenly emerge as swamps overnight, swallowing houses and entire streets, or the mining towns whose tunnels collapse beneath them.</t1062> <t1063>Something similar must have happened to him when he saw the true shape of things to come.</t1063>
<t1064>He doesn't turn his head.</t1064> <t1065>He doesn't acknowledge my presence in any way, despite knowing that I am there.</t1065> <t1066>I could swear he knows, his knowledge is like a smell; something sour, like stale milk.</t1066>
<t1067>The ones you need to be careful about are not Husbands, Aunt Lydia used to say, but Spouses.</t1067> <t1068>You must always try to imagine how they feel.</t1068> <t1069>Of course, they will resent you.</t1069> <t1070>That is quite natural.</t1070> <t1071>Try to feel like them.</t1071> <t1072>Aunt Lydia thought she was good at feeling like other people.</t1072> <t1073>Try to pity them.</t1073> <t1074>Forgive them, for they know not what they do.</t1074> <t1075>Again, that timid smile of a beggar, the flicker of a trembling eye, the upward glance, from round steel-framed glasses, towards the back of the classroom as if the green-painted ceiling was opening up and God was descending on a cloud of Pink Pearl face powder, passing through the cables and sprinkler fire system.</t1075> <t1076>You must understand that they are defeated women.</t1076> <t1077>They have lost their sexuality...</t1077>
<t1078>Her voice was cut off here, a sigh, a pause during which I could hear the collective sigh from those around me.</t1078> <t1079>During these pauses, it was not a good idea to move or stir: Aunt Lydia might have seemed abstracted, but she would notice even the slightest movement.</t1079> <t1080>So, there was only sighing.</t1080>
<t1081>The future is in your hands, he said, starting anew.</t1081> <t1082>He extended his hands towards us, this gesture from the past, meaning both an offer and an invitation, to move towards an embrace, an acceptance.</t1082> <t1083>In your hands, he said, looking at his own hands, as if they had given him this idea.</t1083> <t1084>But there was nothing in his hands.</t1084> <t1085>They were empty.</t1085> <t1086>It was our hands that were expected to be full, with a future that could be held but not seen.</t1086>
<t1087>I walk towards the back door, open it, and go inside, placing my basket on the kitchen table.</t1087> <t1088>The table has been wiped, the flour cleaned; today's bread, freshly baked, is cooling on the rack.</t1088> <t1089>The kitchen smells of yeast, a nostalgic scent.</t1089> <t1090>It reminds me of other kitchens, kitchens that were mine.</t1090> <t1091>It smells like mother, like me when I was a mother in the past.</t1091>
<t1092>This is a dangerous smell, I know I need to keep it outside.</t1092>
<t1093>Rita is there, sitting at the table, peeling and slicing carrots.</t1093> <t1094>These are old carrots, thick, left over from winter, bearded from the time spent in storage.</t1094> <t1095>Fresh carrots, thin and pale in color, won't be ready for weeks.</t1095> <t1096>The knife Rita is using is sharp and shiny, almost seductive.</t1096> <t1097>I would like to own such a knife.</t1097>
<t1098>Rita stops chopping the carrots, stands up, and almost impatiently takes the packages out of the basket.</t1098> <t1099>Even though she always frowns while opening the packages, she is dying to see what I brought; nothing I bring ever fully satisfies her.</t1099> <t1100>She thinks she could do this job better herself.</t1100> <t1101>She would prefer to do the shopping, to get exactly what she wants; she envies me for the walk.</t1101> <t1102>In this house, we all envy something about each other.</t1102>
<t1103>“Oranges have arrived,” I say, “at Milk and Honey.</t1103> <t1104>There are still some left.”</t1104> <t1105>I present this idea to her as a suggestion.</t1105> <t1106>I want to make myself liked.</t1106> <t1107>I had seen the oranges yesterday, but I hadn't told Rita, because she was very irritable yesterday.</t1107> <t1108>“I can get some tomorrow, if you give me a coupon for them.”</t1108> <t1109>I hand her the chicken.</t1109> <t1110>She had asked for steak today, but there wasn't any.</t1110>
<t1111>Rita grumbles without showing excitement or approval.</t1111> <t1112>She will think about this, her grumble says, in her good time.</t1112> <t1113>She unties the string and transparent paper of the chicken.</t1113> <t1114>She turns the chicken over and over, bends a wing, inserts a finger into the cavity, and removes the internal organs.</t1114> <t1115>The chicken lies there, headless and footless, its skin puckered as if cold.</t1115>
<t1116>“Bath day,” says Rita, without looking at me.</t1116>
<t1117>Cora enters the kitchen from the pantry at the back where they keep the cleaning supplies and brooms.</t1117> <t1118>“Chicken,” she says, almost joyfully.</t1118>
<t1119>“Weak and dry,” says Rita, “but it has to work.” “There wasn't much,” I say.</t1119> <t1120>Rita ignores me.</t1120>
<t1121>“It looks big enough to me,” says Cora.</t1121> <t1122>Is she supporting me?</t1122> <t1123>I look at her, wondering if I should smile; but no, all she is thinking about is the chicken.</t1123> <t1124>She is younger than Rita; the slanting sunlight coming from the west-facing window catches her hair, which is parted in the middle and gathered at the back.</t1124> <t1125>She must have been beautiful, until very recently.</t1125> <t1126>There is a small mark on her ears, like a dimple, where the earring holes have closed up.</t1126>
<t1127>“Big,” says Rita, “but bony.</t1127> <t1128>You should have said it clearly.”</t1128> <t1129>For the first time, she speaks looking directly at me.</t1129> <t1130>“He’s not ordinary like you.” She means the Commander’s rank.</t1130> <t1131>But in another sense, she thinks I am ordinary, in her own way.</t1131> <t1132>Rita is over sixty, her thoughts ossified.</t1132>
<t1133>He goes to the sink, holds his hands under the water.</t1133> <t1134>He dries them with a hand towel.</t1134> <t1135>The hand towel is white with blue stripes.</t1135> <t1136>The hand towels have never changed.</t1136> <t1137>Sometimes these kinds of normalcy clashes overwhelm me, like traps.</t1137> <t1138>Ordinary, familiar, reminiscent, like a kick.</t1138> <t1139>I see the hand towel, out of context, I hold my breath.</t1139> <t1140>For some people, in some way, things haven't changed that much.</t1140>
<t1141>“Who is taking a bath?” says Rita, not to me, but to Cora.</t1141> <t1142>“I need to soften this bird.</t1142><t1143>”</t1143>
<t1144>“I'll do it later,” says Cora.</t1144> <t1145>“After I dust.</t1145><t1146>”</t1146>
<t1147>“Then someone should do it,” says Rita.</t1147>
<t1148>They talk about me as if I can't hear them.</t1148> <t1149>To them, I am just a daily chore in the house, one of many tasks.</t1149>
<t1150>I was defeated.</t1150> <t1151>I take the basket and pass through the kitchen door, heading towards the old wall clock along the hall.</t1151> <t1152>The door of the living room is closed.</t1152> <t1153>Daylight enters through the window above the door, falling to the ground and scattering colors: red and blue, purple.</t1153> <t1154>I immediately step into this light, reaching out my hands; they fill with flowers made of light.</t1154> <t1155>I go up the stairs, and in the hall mirror, my face appears distant and white and distorted, like an eye under pressure.</t1155> <t1156>Following the dusty pink runner, I cross the long hall upstairs and return to my room.</t1156>
<t1157>Someone is standing in the hallway, near the door of the room I'm staying in.</t1157> <t1158>The hallway is dim, it's a man, his back is turned to me; he's looking into the room, a dark shadow cast by the light.</t1158> <t1159>Now I can see, it's the Commander, he shouldn't be here.</t1159> <t1160>He hears me coming, turns, hesitates, walks forward.</t1160> <t1161>Toward me.</t1161> <t1162>He's breaking the rule.</t1162> <t1163>What should I do now?</t1163>
<t1164>I am standing, hesitating, I can't see his face, he is looking at me, what does he want?</t1164> <t1165>He moves forward again, pulls aside to avoid touching me, lowers his head, and passes by.</t1165>
<t1166>Something was shown to me, but what?</t1166> <t1167>Like the banner of an unknown country appearing for a moment on the curve of a hill; it could mean an attack, a meeting, the boundary of something, a region.</t1167> <t1168>The signals animals give to each other: lowered blue eyelids, ears laid back, bristling fur.</t1168> <t1169>A fleeting glimpse of bared teeth, what the hell does it think it's doing?</t1169> <t1170>No one else saw it.</t1170> <t1171>I hope.</t1171> <t1172>Was it attacking?</t1172> <t1173>Was it in my room?</t1173>
<t1174>I said "room".</t1174>
<t1175>9</t1175>
<t1176>Okay, then.</t1176> <t1177>There must be a place, after all, that I claim as my own, even in this time.</t1177>
<t1178>I'm waiting, in my room which has now become a waiting room.</t1178> <t1179>When I get into bed, it is a bedroom.</t1179> <t1180>The curtains are still swaying in the light breeze, the sun is still shining outside, even though it doesn't come directly inside through the window.</t1180> <t1181>It has moved westward.</t1181> <t1182>I'm trying not to tell a story, or at least not this one.</t1182>
<t1183>Someone lived in this room, before me.</t1183> <t1184>Someone like me, or at least I prefer to believe so.</t1184>
<t1185>I discovered this three days after being brought here.</t1185>
<t1186>I had a lot of time to kill.</t1186> <t1187>I decided to explore the room.</t1187> <t1188>Calmly, like exploring a hotel room, expecting no surprises, opening and closing desk drawers, cupboard doors, unwrapping individually wrapped small soaps, fluffing the pillows.</t1188> <t1189>Will I ever be in a hotel room again?</t1189> <t1190>How I wasted them, those rooms, that freedom of avoiding being seen.</t1190>
<t1191>Rented freedom.</t1191>
<t1192>In the afternoons, while Luke was still escaping from his wife, while I was still a fantasy for him.</t1192> <t1193>Before getting married and before I became corporeal.</t1193> <t1194>I would always be the first to go there, I would register.</t1194> <t1195>It wasn't that long ago, but now it feels like almost a decade, a century; I can remember what I wore, every blouse, every scarf.</t1195> <t1196>I would wander around the room waiting for him, turn the TV on and off, put perfume behind my ears: Opium.</t1196> <t1197>It was sold in a red and gold Chinese bottle.</t1197>
<t1198>I was angry.</t1198> <t1199>How would I know if he loved me?</t1199> <t1200>It could have been just an adventure.</t1200> <t1201>Why did we always say just?</t1201> <t1202>However, in those times, men and women would try each other on like clothes, discarding those that didn't fit.</t1202>
<t1203>In the end, the door would be knocked; I would open it, with relief and desire.</t1203> <t1204>It was so instantaneous, so intense, Luke.</t1204> <t1205>And yet, it felt like it would never end.</t1205> <t1206>We would lie in the afternoon beds, afterwards, talking with our hands on each other.</t1206> <t1207>Possible, impossible.</t1207> <t1208>What could be done?</t1208> <t1209>We thought we had such problems.</t1209> <t1210>How else would we know we were happy?</t1210>
<t1211>But now, in the same way, I miss the rooms themselves, even those terrible pictures hanging on the walls, autumn leaves or snowy forest landscapes, or women with porcelain doll faces in period costumes, with padded hips and sun umbrellas, or sad-eyed clowns, or tense and chalky-looking fruit bowls.</t1211> <t1212>Clean towels ready to be soiled, trash bins waving in a careless disarray invitingly.</t1212> <t1213>Careless.</t1213> <t1214>I didn't care about anything in those rooms.</t1214> <t1215>With a single lift of the phone, a tray of food would arrive, the food I chose.</t1215> <t1216>The food that was bad for me, undoubtedly, and the drink too.</t1216> <t1217>There were also Bibles placed by a few charitable organizations in the dresser drawers, though probably no one read them much.</t1217> <t1218>There were also greeting cards with pictures of the hotel, you could write something on them and send them to anyone you wanted.</t1218> <t1219>It seems so impossible now; like something I made up.</t1219>
<t1220>Here it is.</t1220> <t1221>I discovered this room, like a hotel room, consuming it calmly and quietly.</t1221> <t1222>I didn't want to spend it all at once; I wanted to make it last.</t1222> <t1223>I divided the room into sections in my mind; I allocated one section to myself each day.</t1223> <t1224>I would examine this single section with all my attention: the irregularity of the plaster under the wallpaper, the scratches under the top layer of paint on the baseboard and window sill, the stains on the bed, because I went so far as to remove the blanket and sheets from the bed, folding them piece by piece, so that if someone were to come, they could quickly restore it to its original state.</t1224>
<t1225>Stains on the bed.</t1225> <t1226>Just like dried flower petals.</t1226> <t1227>Not new.</t1227> <t1228>An old love; there is no other kind of love in this room now.</t1228>
<t1229>When I saw this, this evidence left by two people, about love or something similar to it, at least desire, at least touch, now perhaps between two people who are old or dead, I covered the bed again and lay down on it.</t1229> <t1230>I looked at the blind plaster on the ceiling.</t1230> <t1231>I wanted to feel Luke lying beside me.</t1231> <t1232>They are coming, these assaults of the past, like fainting, a wave that licks past my head.</t1232> <t1233>Sometimes it's very hard to endure.</t1233> <t1234>What should be done, what should be done, I thought.</t1234> <t1235>There is nothing to be done.</t1235> <t1236>They also serve those who just stand and wait.</t1236> <t1237>Or those who lie down and wait.</t1237> <t1238>I know why the glass in the window is unbreakable and why they removed the chandelier.</t1238>
<t1239>I postponed the exploration of the closet until the third day.</t1239> <t1240>First, I carefully examined the door, inside and out, then the brass hooks on the walls - how did they miss the brass hooks?</t1240> <t1241>Why didn't they remove them?</t1241> <t1242>Was it because they were too close to the ground?</t1242> <t1243>However, a pair of pantyhose, that's all you need.</t1243> <t1244>And, the rod carrying the plastic hangers on which my clothes, my red wool cape for cold weather, and the shawl were hanging.</t1244> <t1245>I knelt down to examine the floor and there it was, in small writing, tiny writing, it looked very new, scratched with a needle or maybe just a fingernail, in the corner where the darkest shadow fell: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t1245>
<t1246>I didn't even know what it meant or in which language it was written.</t1246> <t1247>I thought it might be Latin, but I didn't know Latin.</t1247> <t1248>Still, it was a message and it was written, and for that reason alone it was forbidden and yet undiscovered by anyone.</t1248> <t1249>Except for me, the person to whom the message was sent.</t1249> <t1250>The message was sent to whoever would come after.</t1250>
<t1251>I enjoy pondering over this message.</t1251> <t1252>Connecting with her, this unknown woman.</t1252> <t1253>Because she is unknown, or even if she is known, she was never mentioned to me.</t1253> <t1254>I like knowing that the forbidden message could reach, at least to another person, that it could endure on the wall of my locker, that it was opened and read by me.</t1254> <t1255>Sometimes I repeat the words to myself.</t1255> <t1256>They give me a small happiness.</t1256> <t1257>When I imagine the woman who wrote these, I think she is someone my age, maybe a bit younger.</t1257> <t1258>I transform her into Moira, in her college days, in the room next to mine: lively, carefree, athletic, with a bicycle she once had and a backpack for hitchhiking.</t1258> <t1259>Freckled, I think; irreverent, resourceful.</t1259>
<t1260>I wonder who or what it is and what happened to it.</t1260>
<t1261>I tried to get information from Rita, the day I found the message.</t1261>
<t1262>Who was the woman who stayed in the room? I asked.</t1262> <t1263>Before me?</t1263> <t1264>If I had asked differently.</t1264> <t1265>If I had asked, "Was there a woman who stayed in that room before me?", I might not have reached any conclusion.</t1265>
<t1266>"Which one?" he said; he looked reluctant, skeptical, but he almost always looks like that when he talks to me anyway.</t1266>
<t1267>So, there were more than one.</t1267> <t1268>Some of them didn't stay until the end of their duties, exactly two years.</t1268> <t1269>Some were removed, for one reason or another.</t1269> <t1270>Or were they not removed but left?</t1270>
<t1271>The cheerful one.</t1271> <t1272>I am guessing...</t1272> <t1273>The freckled one.</t1273>
<t1274>Did you know him? asked Rita, more skeptical than ever.</t1274>
<t1275>I knew him from before and I lied.</t1275> <t1276>I had heard that he was here.</t1276>
<t1277>Rita accepted this.</t1277> <t1278>She knows that there must be some kind of underground organization for spreading news by word of mouth.</t1278>
<t1279>"It didn't work," he said.</t1279>
<t1280>What do you mean? I asked, trying to appear as neutral as possible.</t1280>
<t1281>Ama Rita clenched her lips.</t1281> <t1282>I'm like a child here, there are things that shouldn't be told to me.</t1282> <t1283>What you don't know can't hurt you, that's all she said.</t1283>
<t1284>10</t1284>
<t1285>Sometimes I sing to myself, in my head; a sad, mournful, Presbyterian song:</t1285>
<t1286>Amazing grace, what sweet sound</t1286>
<t1287>Can save a wretch like me,</t1287>
<t1288>Once lost, but now found,</t1288>
<t1289>Once a captive, but now free.</t1289>
<t1290>I don't even know if the words are correct.</t1290>
<t1291>I can't remember.</t1291> <t1292>These kinds of songs are no longer sung among everyone, especially those containing words like freedom.</t1292> <t1293>They are considered extremely dangerous.</t1293> <t1294>These songs belong to illegal sects.</t1294>
<t1295>I am so lonely, my baby.</t1295>
<t1296>I am so lonely, my baby.</t1296>
<t1297>I am so lonely that I could die.</t1297>
<t1298>This is also forbidden.</t1298> <t1299>I know this from my mother's old cassette player; she had a crackly and unreliable machine that could play these kinds of things.</t1299> <t1300>When her friends came over for a few drinks, she would put on this tape.</t1300>
<t1301>I don't sing very often like this.</t1301> <t1302>It irritates my throat.</t1302>
<t1303>Other than what we hear on the television, there is not much music in this house.</t1303> <t1304>Sometimes Rita hums while kneading dough or peeling something; a wordless, tuneless, and incomprehensible hum.</t1304> <t1305>And sometimes Serena's thin voice comes from the front sitting room, from a record made long ago, now playing softly; so she won't get caught sitting there knitting, listening to the record, and reminiscing about her old but now taken fame: Thank God.</t1305>
<t1306>For this time of year, the weather is very hot.</t1306> <t1307>These types of houses turn into ovens when they see the sun, there isn't enough insulation.</t1307> <t1308>The air around me is still, despite the light breeze, the breath coming through the curtains.</t1308> <t1309>I wish I could open the window all the way.</t1309> <t1310>Soon, we will be allowed to wear summer clothes.</t1310>
<t1311>Summer dresses have been taken out of the suitcase, hanging in the closet; two of them, pure cotton, better than the cheaper synthetics, still, when the weather is hot and humid, in July and August, they also make you sweat.</t1311><t1312>Don't worry about getting sunburned, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t1312><t1313>The inappropriate situations women used to put themselves in.</t1313><t1314>Oiled up like meat on a skewer, bare backs and shoulders, on the street, in front of everyone, legs without even stockings, it's no wonder such things used to happen.</t1314><t1315>Whatever she used it for, it was the word she used when what was coming out of her mouth would be very unpleasant, disgusting, or terrible.</t1315><t1316>For her, a successful life was one where you avoided things, a life that excluded things.</t1316><t1317>Such things don't happen to good women.</t1317><t1318>Moreover, it doesn't do any good for facial beauty, in any way, it wrinkles you up like a dried apple.</t1318><t1319>However, we were no longer expected to care about our facial beauty, she had forgotten this.</t1319>
<t1320>In the park, Aunt Lydia would say, they would lie on blankets, sometimes, men and women together, and then she would start crying, standing before us like that, in all her grandeur.</t1320>
<t1321>I'm doing my best, he would say.</t1321> <t1322>I'm trying to give you the best chance you can have.</t1322> <t1323>He was blinking, the light was too much for him, his lips trembling around his slightly protruding, long, and yellow front teeth; I thought of the dead mice we found on our doorstep, living in a house, the three of us, with our cat who offered us these mice, making us four.</t1323>
<t1324>Aunt Lydia pressed her hand to her mouth, which resembled that of a dead rodent.</t1324> <t1325>After a while, she removed it.</t1325> <t1326>I wanted to cry too, because it reminded me of the past.</t1326> <t1327>I would say to Luke, I hope she doesn't leave half-eaten mice around.</t1327>
<t1328>Don't think that this is easy for me either, Aunt Lydia would say.</t1328>
<t1329>Moira entered the room like a gust of wind, throwing her denim jacket to the floor.</t1329> <t1330>Do you have a cigarette? she asked.</t1330>
<t1331>In my bag, I said.</t1331> <t1332>But I don't have any matches.</t1332>
<t1333>Moira is rummaging through my bag.</t1333> <t1334>You should throw away some of this junk, she says.</t1334> <t1335>I'm throwing an inner - bitch party.</t1335>
<t1336>What is it? I say.</t1336> <t1337>There's no point in insisting on working, Moira won't allow it; she's like a cat that jumps onto the page when you try to read.</t1337>
<t1338>You know, just in underwear.</t1338> <t1339>Whore paraphernalia.</t1339> <t1340>Lace panties, garter belts with clasps.</t1340> <t1341>Bras that lift the breasts up.</t1341> <t1342>She finds my lighter, lights a cigarette she took from my bag.</t1342> <t1343>Want one?</t1343> <t1344>Thinking it's hers, she generously tosses the pack to me.</t1344>
<t1345>Thanks, the edge of my ass, I say sarcastically.</t1345> <t1346>You're crazy.</t1346> <t1347>Where did you even get this idea?</t1347>
<t1348>While trying to read on my own, says Moira.</t1348> <t1349>I have connections.</t1349> <t1350>A friend of my mother gave this idea.</t1350> <t1351>It's very popular in the suburbs, they think they have to compete as soon as they get teenage acne.</t1351> <t1352>The porn market and what you've got situations, you understand.</t1352>
<t1353>I am laughing.</t1353> <t1354>He/She/It always made me laugh.</t1354>
<t1355>But here? I say.</t1355> <t1356>Who will come?</t1356> <t1357>Who needs it?</t1357>
<t1358>There is no age for learning, he says.</t1358> <t1359>Come on, it will be amazing.</t1359> <t1360>We will laugh so hard we'll wet ourselves.</t1360>
<t1361>Were we living like this back then?</t1361> <t1362>But we were probably living as usual.</t1362> <t1363>Everyone does that, most of the time.</t1363> <t1364>Whatever happens, happens as usual.</t1364> <t1365>Even this is as usual, now.</t1365>
<t1366>We used to live without caring as usual.</t1366> <t1367>Not caring is not the same as ignorance; you need to work on it.</t1367>
<t1368>Nothing changes all at once: you die being boiled alive in a bathtub that heats up gradually without you realizing it.</t1368> <t1369>Of course, there were stories in the newspapers, bodies in ditches or forests, beaten to death or mutilated, assaulted as they used to say; but these were about other women and the men who did these things were other men.</t1369> <t1370>None of them were men we knew.</t1370> <t1371>Newspaper stories were like dreams to us, bad dreams that others had.</t1371> <t1372>How terrible, we would say, and they were, but they were terribly without being believable.</t1372> <t1373>They were overly melodramatic, belonging to a dimension that was not part of our lives.</t1373>
<t1374>We were people who never made it to the newspapers.</t1374> <t1375>We lived in the white margins of the print.</t1375> <t1376>This gave us more freedom.</t1376>
<t1377>We used to live in the gaps between the stories.</t1377>
<t1378>The sound of a car being started is coming from down the road.</t1378> <t1379>This area is quiet, traffic is not heavy, you can clearly hear such things here: car engines, lawn mowers, the trimming of a bush, the slamming of a door.</t1379> <t1380>You could clearly hear a shout or a gunshot, if such sounds were to occur.</t1380> <t1381>Sometimes, the sounds of sirens coming from a distance can be heard.</t1381>
<t1382>I go to the window and sit on the narrow window ledge, which is uncomfortable.</t1382> <t1383>There is a small, hard cushion with embroidery on it: FAITH, surrounded by a wreath of lilies, written in angular letters.</t1383> <t1384>FAITH is in pale blue, and the leaves of the lilies are in dirty green.</t1384> <t1385>This cushion was once used elsewhere, worn out, but not enough to be thrown away.</t1385> <t1386>Somehow, it was overlooked.</t1386>
<t1387>I can let my eyes wander over the word FAITH for minutes, dozens of minutes.</t1387> <t1388>The only thing they gave me to read.</t1388> <t1389>If I get caught doing this, would it be considered a crime?</t1389> <t1390>I didn't put the pillow here myself.</t1390>
<t1391>The engine is running and I lean forward, pulling the white curtains towards my face like a veil.</t1391> <t1392>The curtain is semi-transparent, I can see outside.</t1392> <t1393>If I press my forehead against the glass and look down, I can see the rear half of the Whirlwind.</t1393> <t1394>There is no one, but as I watch, I see Nick circling around to the back of the car and opening the door, standing upright beside it.</t1394> <t1395>His hat is neat now and his shirt sleeves are adjusted and buttoned.</t1395> <t1396>I can't see his face because I am looking at him from above.</t1396>
<t1397>Now the Commander is going outside.</t1397> <t1398>I see him only for a moment, as he walks towards the car, as if he has shrunk.</t1398> <t1399>He is not wearing his hat, so he is not going on official business.</t1399> <t1400>His hair is gray.</t1400> <t1401>Out of politeness, you would call it silvery.</t1401> <t1402>I don't feel polite.</t1402> <t1403>The previous one was bald, so I guess I've made some progress.</t1403>
<t1404>If I could spit, or throw something out the window, for example, the pillow, it’s possible I might hit him.</t1404>
<t1405>Moira and I, with paper bags filled with water.</t1405> <t1406>They were called water bombs.</t1406> <t1407>We would lean out of my dormitory window and throw them at the boys below.</t1407> <t1408>It was Moira's idea.</t1408> <t1409>What were they trying to do?</t1409> <t1410>Climbing the stairs, for something.</t1410> <t1411>For our underwear.</t1411>
<t1412>Once upon a time, co-education was practiced here, and there were still urinals in one of the bathrooms on our floor.</t1412> <t1413>But when I arrived, men and women were no longer together as they used to be.</t1413>
<t1414>The commander bends down, gets into the car, and disappears, and Nick closes the door.</t1414> <t1415>A moment later, the car moves backward down the driveway, goes out onto the street, and disappears behind the bushes.</t1415>
<t1416>I should have hated this man.</t1416> <t1417>I know that this is how I should feel, but in reality, this is not what I feel.</t1417> <t1418>What I feel is something more complicated than that.</t1418> <t1419>I don't know what to call it.</t1419> <t1420>It's not love.</t1420>
<t1421>11</t1421>
<t1422>I went to the doctor yesterday morning.</t1422> <t1423>I was taken, that is, by a Guardian with a red armband responsible for such matters.</t1423> <t1424>We went in a red car, he in the front, me in the back.</t1424> <t1425>Without my partner beside me; in such situations, I am alone.</t1425>
<t1426>I am taken to the doctor once a month for tests: urine, hormone, smear test, blood test; just like before, the only difference is that now it is mandatory.</t1426>
<t1427>The doctor's office is in a modern business building.</t1427> <t1428>We go up by elevator, silently, the Guardian facing me.</t1428> <t1429>I see the back of his head in the black mirrored wall of the elevator.</t1429> <t1430>I enter the office; he, on the other hand, waits outside in the hallway on one of the chairs placed there for this purpose, along with the other Guardians.</t1430>
<t1431>There are other women in the waiting room, three of them in red dresses: this doctor is a specialist.</t1431> <t1432>We are secretly looking at each other, measuring our bellies: is anyone lucky?</t1432> <t1433>The male nurse is recording our names and the numbers on our ID cards into the Compudoc, to see if we are who we are supposed to be.</t1433> <t1434>1.</t1434> <t1435>He is 1.80 meters tall, around forty years old, and has a scar running diagonally across his cheek; he is typing, though his hands are too big for the keyboard, and he still carries his gun in a holster under his arm.</t1435>
<t1436>When I am called, I pass through the door and enter the inner room.</t1436> <t1437>A white room, featureless, just like the outer room, but here there is a folding screen, a red fabric stretched over a frame, with a golden eye on it, and below that, a sword wrapped with a snake, like some kind of handle.</t1437> <t1438>Snakes and swords are remnants of a broken symbolism from a previous time.</t1438>
<t1439>After filling the small bottle left for me in the small bathroom, I take off my clothes behind the screen and leave them folded on the chair.</t1439> <t1440>When I am naked, I lie down on the examination table, on the cold, crinkling, disposable paper sheet, and pull the second sheet, the fabric one, over my body.</t1440> <t1441>There is another sheet hanging down from the ceiling at neck level.</t1441> <t1442>It divides me in two, so that the doctor will never see my face.</t1442> <t1443>He is only interested in a body.</t1443>
<t1444>When I am ready, I reach out and pull back the small lever on the right side of the table.</t1444> <t1445>A bell rings somewhere else, one that I cannot hear.</t1445> <t1446>A minute later, the door opens, footsteps enter, and the sound of breathing is heard.</t1446> <t1447>It is not expected to speak to me unless absolutely necessary.</t1447> <t1448>But this doctor is talkative.</t1448>
<t1449>“How are you?” he says, in a manner of speaking from another time.</t1449> <t1450>The fabric is lifted off my skin, a breeze sends a shiver through me.</t1450> <t1451>A cold finger, rubber-covered and lubricated, slides inside me, probing and poking.</t1451> <t1452>The finger withdraws, entering and exiting in a different way.</t1452>
<t1453>“No problem,” says the doctor, as if to himself.</t1453> <t1454>“Do you have any pain, sweetie?”</t1454> <t1455>He calls me sweetie.</t1455>
<t1456>"No," I say.</t1456>
<t1457>When the time comes, my breasts are also examined for signs of maturity and deterioration.</t1457> <t1458>His breath approaches, I smell stale smoke, aftershave lotion, tobacco dust in his hair.</t1458> <t1459>Then the voice, very soft, close to my head: it's him, creating a bulge in the sheet:</t1459>
<t1460>“I can help you,” he says.</t1460> <t1461>He whispers.</t1461>
<t1462>“What?” I say.</t1462>
<t1463>“Shhh,” he says.</t1463> <t1464>“I can help you.</t1464> <t1465>I’ve helped others.”</t1465> <t1466>“Help me?” I say, my voice as low as his.</t1466> <t1467>“How?” Does he know something, has he seen Luke, found him, can he bring him back?</t1467>
<t1468>“What do you think?” he says, still clearly breathing heavily.</t1468> <t1469>Is it his hand sliding up my leg?</t1469> <t1470>He has taken off his glove.</t1470> <t1471>“The door is locked.</t1471> <t1472>No one can come in.</t1472> <t1473>No one will ever know that the baby isn't his.</t1473><t1474>”</t1474>
<t1475>He lifts the sheet.</t1475> <t1476>The lower part of the face is covered with a white cloth mask, that's the regulation.</t1476> <t1477>Two brown eyes, a nose, a head with brown hair.</t1477> <t1478>His hand is between my legs.</t1478> <t1479>“Most of these old men can't manage it anymore,” he says.</t1479> <t1480>“Or they're sterile.</t1480><t1481>”</t1481>
<t1482>I almost lose my breath: He said a forbidden word.</t1482> <t1483>Sterile.</t1483> <t1484>There is no such thing as a sterile man anymore, officially.</t1484> <t1485>There are fertile and sterile women, that's the law.</t1485>
<t1486>“Many women do this,” she continues.</t1486> <t1487>“You want a baby, don't you?</t1487><t1488>”</t1488>
<t1489>“Yes,” I say.</t1489> <t1490>This is true, I don't ask why, because I know.</t1490> <t1491>Give me children, or else I will die.</t1491> <t1492>There are multiple meanings in this.</t1492>
<t1493>“You are soft,” he says.</t1493> <t1494>“It's the perfect time.</t1494> <t1495>It will happen today or tomorrow, why let it go to waste?</t1495> <t1496>Just a minute is enough, darling.”</t1496> <t1497>He used to call his wife this way, once; maybe he still does, but in reality, it’s a broad term.</t1497> <t1498>Darling is all of us.</t1498>
<t1499>I hesitate.</t1499> <t1500>She offers herself to me, her services, even putting herself in danger.</t1500>
<t1501>“I hate seeing what they do to you,” he mutters.</t1501> <t1502>This is real, genuine sympathy; yet he likes it, the sympathy and everything.</t1502> <t1503>His eyes are filled with tears of compassion, his hand moves over me, nervously and impatiently.</t1503>
<t1504>“This is very dangerous,” I say.</t1504> <t1505>“No.</t1505> <t1506>I can't do it.” The penalty is death.</t1506> <t1507>But they have to catch you doing it, with two witnesses.</t1507> <t1508>What's going on, is the room bugged, who's waiting just outside the door?</t1508>
<t1509>He stands.</t1509> <t1510>“Think about this,” he says.</t1510> <t1511>“I saw your card.</t1511> <t1512>You don't have much time left.</t1512> <t1513>But this is your life.</t1513><t1514>”</t1514>
<t1515>“Thank you,” I say.</t1515> <t1516>I must leave the impression that I am not angry, that I am open to this suggestion.</t1516> <t1517>He withdraws his hand, almost lazily, delaying, for him this is not the last word.</t1517> <t1518>He could tamper with the tests, report me as having cancer, being infertile, ensure that I am sent to the Colonies with the Unwomen.</t1518> <t1519>None of this is expressed, but the knowledge of this power hangs in the air nonetheless, when he lightly taps my hip, when he withdraws himself behind the hanging sheet.</t1519>
<t1520>“Next month,” he says.</t1520>
<t1521>I am putting my dress back on behind the screen.</t1521> <t1522>My hands are trembling.</t1522> <t1523>Why am I afraid?</t1523> <t1524>I haven't broken any rules, made any promises, or put myself in danger; everything is safe.</t1524> <t1525>What scares me is this choice.</t1525> <t1526>An escape route, a salvation.</t1526>
<t1527>12</t1527>
<t1528>The bathroom is next to the bedroom.</t1528> <t1529>It is covered with wallpaper with small blue flowers, forget-me-nots, and the curtains match the wallpaper.</t1529> <t1530>There is a blue bathroom rug and a blue faux fur cover on the toilet seat; what this bathroom lacks from the previous time is a doll hiding spare toilet paper under its skirt.</t1530> <t1531>Other than that, the mirror above the sink has been removed and replaced with a rectangular piece of tin, and there is no lock on the door, of course, nor are there any razors.</t1531> <t1532>The first incidents happened in the bathrooms; there were cuttings, drownings.</t1532> <t1533>Before all the malfunctions were fixed.</t1533> <t1534>To ensure no one enters, Cora sits on a chair in the hallway outside.</t1534> <t1535>In a bathroom, in a bathtub, you are vulnerable, Aunt Lydia would say.</t1535> <t1536>She would not tell us what would hurt us.</t1536>
<t1537>A bath is a necessity, but at the same time, it is also a luxury.</t1537> <t1538>Just lifting the heavy white wings and veil, just feeling my own hair with my own hands is a luxury.</t1538> <t1539>My hair is now long, uncut.</t1539> <t1540>Hair is long, but it must be covered.</t1540> <t1541>According to Aunt Lydia: Saint Paul used to say it should either be like this or cut short.</t1541> <t1542>She would laugh, with that unrestrained neigh, as if she had told a joke.</t1542>
<t1543>Cora has turned on the water.</t1543> <t1544>Steam is rising from the bathtub, it looks like a soup bowl.</t1544> <t1545>I'm taking off the rest of my clothes: the top, the white undershirt and petticoat, the red socks, the loose cotton pants.</t1545> <t1546>Moira used to say that pantyhose would cook your crotch.</t1546> <t1547>Aunt Lydia would never use the phrase cook your crotch.</t1547> <t1548>The phrase she used was not hygienic.</t1548> <t1549>She wanted everything to be very hygienic.</t1549>
<t1550>My nakedness already feels strange to me.</t1550> <t1551>My body looks outdated.</t1551> <t1552>On the beach, did I really wear a swimsuit?</t1552> <t1553>I did, without thinking, among men, displaying my legs, my arms, my hips, and my back, without caring that I could be seen.</t1553> <t1554>Shameful, immoral.</t1554> <t1555>I avoid looking at my body, not because it is shameful or immoral, but because I don't want to see it.</t1555> <t1556>I don't want to look at something that defines me so thoroughly.</t1556>
<t1557>I enter the water, I lie down, I let the water envelop me.</t1557> <t1558>The water is as soft as a hand.</t1558> <t1559>I close my eyes and here it is, suddenly, without warning; it must have been triggered by the scent of the soap.</t1559> <t1560>I bury my face in the soft hair at the back of your neck and inhale your scent, of baby powder, washed skin, and shampoo; with the faint smell of urine in the background.</t1560> <t1561>When I bathe, you are always this age.</t1561> <t1562>You appear to me at different ages.</t1562> <t1563>This is how I understand that you are not really a ghost.</t1563> <t1564>If you were a ghost, you would always be the same age.</t1564>
<t1565>One day, when he was just eleven months old, right before he started walking, a woman stole him from the supermarket cart.</t1565> <t1566>It was a Saturday, and since both Luke and I worked, we did our weekly shopping on the weekend.</t1566> <t1567>Back then, he used to sit in the small baby seat with leg holes in the supermarket carts.</t1567> <t1568>He was quite happy, I had turned my back, I think it was the cat food section; Luke was on the other side of the store, near the meat counter, out of sight.</t1568> <t1569>He enjoyed choosing what kind of meat we would eat throughout the week.</t1569> <t1570>He would say that men needed more meat than women, that it wasn't a superstition or nonsense, and that there were studies done on this.</t1570> <t1571>There are some differences, he would say.</t1571> <t1572>He loved saying this, as if I were trying to prove the opposite.</t1572> <t1573>But he mostly said this when my mother was around.</t1573> <t1574>He loved teasing her.</t1574>
<t1575>I heard her start to cry.</t1575> <t1576>When I turned around, I saw a woman I had never seen before disappearing down the passageway in someone's arms.</t1576> <t1577>When I shouted, someone stopped the woman.</t1577> <t1578>She must have been around thirty-five years old.</t1578> <t1579>She was crying and saying that it was her own baby, that it was given to her by God, and that God had sent her a sign.</t1579> <t1580>I felt sorry for her.</t1580> <t1581>The store manager apologized and they held her until the police arrived.</t1581>
<t1582>Gone crazy, said Luke.</t1582>
<t1583>At that time, I thought it was an isolated incident.</t1583>
<t1584>She is disappearing, I can't keep her here with me, now she's gone.</t1584> <t1585>Maybe I really think of her as a ghost, the ghost of a dead girl; a little girl who died at the age of five.</t1585> <t1586>I remember the photographs I once had: holding her in my arms, standard poses, mother and baby, trapped in a frame, for safety.</t1586> <t1587>Behind my closed eyes, I can see myself as I am now: in the pantry, sitting beside an open drawer or chest where baby clothes are folded and stored, and a lock of light yellow hair cut when she was two years old and placed in an envelope.</t1587> <t1588>Her hair darkened later.</t1588>
<t1589>I no longer have these, the clothes and the hair.</t1589> <t1590>I wonder what happened to all our belongings.</t1590> <t1591>They were looted, emptied, moved.</t1591> <t1592>They were confiscated.</t1592>
<t1593>I learned to live without many things.</t1593> <t1594>If you have too much, Aunt Lydia used to say, you become overly attached to this material world and forget spiritual values.</t1594> <t1595>You must nurture spiritual poverty.</t1595> <t1596>Those who are patient and meek are blessed.</t1596> <t1597>She didn't say anything about inheriting the earth, for some reason.</t1597>
<t1598>I'm lying down, surrounded by water, next to a non-existent open drawer, thinking of a girl who didn't die at five years old, hoping she still exists, though not for me.</t1598> <t1599>I wonder if I exist for her?</t1599> <t1600>Am I a photograph somewhere, in that dark place at the back of her mind?</t1600>
<t1601>They must have told her that I died.</t1601> <t1602>That is what they would think of doing.</t1602> <t1603>They said it would make it easier for her to adjust.</t1603>
<t1604>He must be eight years old now.</t1604> <t1605>I added the time I lost, I know how much has passed.</t1605> <t1606>They were right, thinking he was dead is easier.</t1606> <t1607>In this case, I don't have to hope or strive in vain.</t1607> <t1608>Why, Aunt Lydia would say, would you bang your head against a wall?</t1608> <t1609>Sometimes she would express things vividly.</t1609>
<t1610>“I don't have enough time to wait for you all day,” says Cora's voice from outside the door.</t1610> <t1611>True, she doesn't have time.</t1611> <t1612>She doesn't fully possess anything.</t1612> <t1613>I shouldn't deprive her of her time.</t1613> <t1614>I'm soaping myself, using the bath brush and pumice stone to scrape off dead skin.</t1614> <t1615>Such cleaning tools are provided.</t1615> <t1616>I want to be completely clean, germ-free, bacteria-free, like the surface of the moon.</t1616> <t1617>I won't be able to bathe tonight and the following day, a full day.</t1617> <t1618>It's harmful, they say, so why leave it to chance?</t1618>
<t1619>Now I can't avoid seeing the small tattoo on my ankle.</t1619> <t1620>Four numbers and an eye, a passport in the opposite sense.</t1620> <t1621>It aims to guarantee that I can never disappear to another place.</t1621> <t1622>I am something too important and rare for this to be desired.</t1622> <t1623>I am a national resource.</t1623>
<t1624>I pull the plug of the bathtub, dry off, and put on my red towel robe.</t1624> <t1625>I leave today's dress here, Cora will be there to wash it.</t1625> <t1626>When I return to the room, I get dressed again.</t1626> <t1627>The white bonnet is not necessary for the night, because I won't be going out.</t1627> <t1628>Everyone in this house knows what my face looks like.</t1628> <t1629>Still, I put on the red veil, covering my wet hair and unshaven head.</t1629> <t1630>Where had I seen that movie about the women kneeling in the town square with their hands tied and their hair cut off in clumps and scattered on the ground?</t1630> <t1631>What were their crimes?</t1631> <t1632>It must have been a long time ago, because I can't remember.</t1632>
<t1633>Cora brings my dinner, covered, on a tray.</t1633> <t1634>She knocks on the door before entering.</t1634> <t1635>I love her for this.</t1635> <t1636>It means she thinks I still have some semblance of what we used to call privacy.</t1636>
<t1637>“Thank you,” I say, taking the tray from him; he really does smile at me, but turns back without responding.</t1637> <t1638>When we are alone together, he is apprehensive of me.</t1638>
<t1639>I place the tray on the small white-painted table and pull the chair next to it.</t1639> <t1640>I lift the cover off the tray.</t1640> <t1641>A chicken drumstick, overcooked.</t1641> <t1642>Better than being bloody, because she either undercooks or overcooks it.</t1642> <t1643>Rita somehow lets you know she's offended.</t1643> <t1644>A cooked potato, green beans, salad.</t1644> <t1645>Canned pear for dessert.</t1645> <t1646>A sufficiently good meal, though plain and dull.</t1646> <t1647>A healthy meal.</t1647> <t1648>You must get your vitamins and minerals, Aunt Lydia would say coquettishly.</t1648> <t1649>You must be a valuable vessel.</t1649> <t1650>Still, no coffee or tea, no alcohol.</t1650> <t1651>Research has been done on this matter.</t1651> <t1652>There's also a paper napkin, just like in cafeterias.</t1652>
<t1653>I think about the others, those who don't have these things.</t1653> <t1654>This is the vital region of the country, I live a life of prosperity and abundance; Aunt Lydia would say, may God make us truly grateful, or was it thankful, and I start eating.</t1654> <t1655>I'm not hungry tonight.</t1655> <t1656>My stomach is nauseous.</t1656> <t1657>But there's no place to throw the food away, no potted plant, and I can't risk the toilet.</t1657> <t1658>I'm extremely nervous, that's the reason.</t1658> <t1659>Can I leave it on the plate and ask Cora not to report me?</t1659> <t1660>I chew and chew and swallow, feeling myself sweat.</t1660> <t1661>The food forms lumps in my stomach, like a handful of compressed wet cardboard.</t1661>
<t1662>Downstairs, in the dining room, there should be candles, a white cloth, silverware, flowers, and glasses with wine on the large mahogany table.</t1662> <t1663>The clinking of knives against porcelain, the barely audible sigh of Serena Joy, the faint sound as she places her fork on the table without touching half of what's on her plate will be heard.</t1663> <t1664>Possibly, she will say she has no appetite.</t1664> <t1665>Possibly, she will say nothing.</t1665> <t1666>If she says something, would the Commander respond?</t1666> <t1667>If she says nothing, would he notice?</t1667> <t1668>I wonder how she manages to make herself noticed.</t1668> <t1669>It must be difficult, I suppose.</t1669>
<t1670>There is a piece of butter next to the plate.</t1670> <t1671>I tear off a corner of the paper napkin, wrap the butter in it, take it to the cupboard, and slide it towards the toe of the right shoe of my spare pair, just like I've done before.</t1671> <t1672>I crumple the remaining napkin: no one, of course, will try to straighten it out or wonder if anything is missing.</t1672> <t1673>I will use the butter later tonight.</t1673> <t1674>It wouldn't be good to smell like butter tonight.</t1674>
<t1675>I'm waiting.</t1675> <t1676>I'm adjusting myself.</t1676> <t1677>My existence is something I need to adjust now, like adjusting a conversation.</t1677> <t1678>What I need to present is something artificial, not natural.</t1678>
<t1679>V</t1679>
<t1680>Candy</t1680>
<t1681>13</t1681>
<t1682>There is free time.</t1682> <t1683>This is one of the things I wasn't prepared for - the amount of time that isn't filled, the long parentheses of nothingness.</t1683> <t1684>Time similar to white noise.</t1684> <t1685>I wish I could craft something.</t1685> <t1686>Weaving, knitting; something to do with my hands.</t1686> <t1687>I want a cigarette.</t1687> <t1688>I remember wandering through art galleries, from the nineteenth century building: their obsession with harems at that time.</t1688> <t1689>Dozens of harem paintings; fat women lying sprawled on divans, with turbans or velvet caps on their heads, fanning themselves with peacock feathers, a harem guard standing watch in the background.</t1689> <t1690>Studies on motionless bodies, paintings made by men who had never been there.</t1690> <t1691>These paintings were considered erotic, and I thought so too, back then, but now I understand what they were really about.</t1691> <t1692>They were about the lack of vitality; about waiting, about unused objects.</t1692> <t1693>They were about boredom.</t1693>
<t1694>But perhaps boredom is erotic, women and men endure it for each other.</t1694>
<t1695>I'm waiting, washed, brushed, fed, like a prize pig.</t1695> <t1696>In the eighties, they had invented pig balls for a while, for the pigs fattened in pens.</t1696> <t1697>These were large colorful balls; the pigs were rolling them here and there with their snouts.</t1697> <t1698>Pig sellers claimed that this improved muscle quality; pigs were curious animals, they liked having something to think about.</t1698>
<t1699>I had read this in the Introduction to Psychology class; this and the section about the rats in the cage given electric shocks to make them perform a task.</t1699> <t1700>And also about the pigeons trained to peck a button that produced a corn kernel.</t1700> <t1701>These pigeons were divided into three groups: the first group received a corn kernel for every peck, the second group for every two pecks, and the third group randomly.</t1701> <t1702>When the man overseeing the experiment stopped the flow of corn, the first group gave up shortly, the second group a bit later.</t1702> <t1703>The third group never gave up.</t1703> <t1704>They continued pecking until they died rather than stop.</t1704> <t1705>Who knows what will work?</t1705>
<t1706>If only I had a pig ball.</t1706>
<t1707>I lie down on the woven carpet.</t1707> <t1708>You can always practice, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t1708> <t1709>Several times a day, according to your daily tasks.</t1709> <t1710>Arms at your sides, knees bent, lift your pelvis, roll your spine down.</t1710> <t1711>Breathe in.</t1711> <t1712>Repeat.</t1712> <t1713>Breathe in, hold, release, counting to five.</t1713> <t1714>We used to do this in the room that used to be the Household Management room, where the sewing machines and clothes dryers had been removed; lying on small Japanese-style mats, while a tape played Les Sylphides, in unison.</t1714> <t1715>Now, as I lift, lie to the side, and breathe in, this is what I hear inside my head.</t1715> <t1716>Behind my closed eyes, among the trees, thin white dancers move gracefully back and forth, their legs fluttering like the wings of trapped birds.</t1716>
<t1717>In the afternoons, for an hour, between three and four, we would lie in our beds in the gymnasium.</t1717> <t1718>They would say it was a time for rest and meditation.</t1718> <t1719>At the time, I thought they did it to stop training us and give themselves a little break; I knew the Aunts who were off duty would go to the teachers' lounge for a cup of coffee or whatever they called it.</t1719> <t1720>But now I think this rest was also an exercise.</t1720> <t1721>They were giving us a chance to get used to having free time.</t1721>
<t1722>"A candy," said Aunt Lydia with her coquettish manner.</t1722>
<t1723>The strange thing was that we also needed this rest.</t1723> <t1724>Most of us would sleep.</t1724> <t1725>We were often tired there.</t1725> <t1726>I think we were under the influence of a pill or drug they put in the food to calm us down.</t1726> <t1727>But maybe there was no such thing.</t1727> <t1728>Maybe that was the reason for that place.</t1728> <t1729>After the initial shock, once we had settled down, it was better to be lethargic.</t1729> <t1730>You could say you were conserving your strength.</t1730>
<t1731>When Moira arrived, I must have spent three weeks there.</t1731> <t1732>She had been brought to the gym by the two Aunts, as usual, while we were taking our nap.</t1732> <t1733>She was still in her clothes, jeans and a blue sweatshirt - her hair was short, as usual she defied fashion - so I recognized her immediately.</t1733> <t1734>She saw me too, but turned in another direction, she had already learned what was safe as soon as she arrived.</t1734> <t1735>There was a bruise on her left cheek, starting to turn purple.</t1735> <t1736>The Aunts took her to an empty bed where the red dress had been prepared and placed on it.</t1736> <t1737>While the Aunts stood at the foot of the bed and the rest of us watched through our half-closed eyes, she undressed silently, then began to dress again.</t1737> <t1738>When she bent forward, I could see the bumps on her spine.</t1738>
<t1739>I couldn't talk to him for a few days; we were just looking at each other with glances as small as sips.</t1739> <t1740>Friendships were suspicious, we knew this, we kept our distance from each other in the cafeteria lunch lines and in the hallways between classes.</t1740> <t1741>But on the fourth day, during our paired walk around the football field, he fell in step beside me.</t1741> <t1742>White wings were not given until graduation, there were only veils; thus, we could talk as long as we didn't raise our voices and didn't turn our heads to look at each other.</t1742> <t1743>The Aunts would walk at the front and back of the line, so the only danger could come from the others.</t1743> <t1744>Some were believers and could report us.</t1744>
<t1745>This is a madhouse, said Moira.</t1745>
<t1746>I am so happy to see you, I said.</t1746>
<t1747>Where can we talk? said Moira.</t1747>
<t1748>In the bathroom, I said.</t1748> <t1749>Look at the time.</t1749> <t1750>The last stall, at two thirty.</t1750>
<t1751>This was all we talked about.</t1751>
<t1752>Having Moira here makes me feel safer.</t1752> <t1753>If we raise our hands, we can go to the bathroom, although there is a limit of a few times a day because they record it on a card.</t1753> <t1754>I'm looking at the electric and round clock above the green board at the front, it's two thirty, which coincides with Confession Hour.</t1754> <t1755>Aunt Lydia is here along with Aunt Helena, because Confession Hour is special.</t1755> <t1756>Aunt Lydia is fat, she used to be in charge of the Regime's agency in Iowa.</t1756> <t1757>She is good at getting confessions.</t1757>
<t1758>Janine, at the age of fourteen, is describing how she was raped by a gang and had an abortion.</t1758> <t1759>She told the same story last week as well.</t1759> <t1760>While telling it, she almost seemed to take pride in it.</t1760> <t1761>It might not even be true.</t1761> <t1762>It's better to make something up than to say you have nothing to reveal during Confession Hour.</t1762> <t1763>However, since it's Janine we're talking about, what she says is more or less true.</t1763>
<t1764>But whose fault was this? says Aunt Helena, raising her stubby finger.</t1764>
<t1765>We are all saying in unison, it's his fault, it's his fault, it's his fault.</t1765>
<t1766>Who encouraged them? Aunt Helena exclaims, pleased with us.</t1766>
<t1767>He encouraged.</t1767> <t1768>He encouraged.</t1768> <t1769>He encouraged.</t1769>
<t1770>Why did God allow such a terrible thing to happen?</t1770>
<t1771>To teach him a lesson.</t1771> <t1772>To teach him a lesson.</t1772> <t1773>To teach him a lesson.</t1773>
<t1774>Last week, Janine was in tears.</t1774> <t1775>Aunt Helena made her kneel in front of the class, in a way that we could all see her, her red face, and her runny nose.</t1775> <t1776>Her hair was dull blonde, her eyelashes so light-colored that they seemed nonexistent, like the lost eyelashes of someone who had escaped a fire.</t1776> <t1777>Burned eyes.</t1777> <t1778>She looked disgusting: thin, misshapen, blotchy, pink, like a newborn rat.</t1778> <t1779>None of us wanted to look like that, ever.</t1779> <t1780>Even though we knew what had been done to her, for a moment, we hated her.</t1780>
<t1781>Crybaby.</t1781> <t1782>Crybaby.</t1782> <t1783>Crybaby.</t1783>
<t1784>We were serious about this, and that's the bad part.</t1784>
<t1785>I used to think good things about myself.</t1785> <t1786>I wasn't thinking that way at the time.</t1786>
<t1787>That was last week.</t1787> <t1788>This week Janine doesn't expect us to scold her.</t1788> <t1789>It was my fault, she says.</t1789> <t1790>It was my own fault.</t1790> <t1791>I encouraged them.</t1791> <t1792>I deserved that pain.</t1792>
<t1793>Very good, Janine, says Aunt Lydia.</t1793> <t1794>You are an example.</t1794>
<t1795>Before I raise my hand, I need to wait for this to be over.</t1795> <t1796>Sometimes, if you ask at the wrong time, they say No.</t1796> <t1797>If you really need to go, you might find yourself in a tough situation.</t1797> <t1798>Yesterday, Dolores wet herself.</t1798> <t1799>Two Aunts grabbed her by the armpits and dragged her outside.</t1799> <t1800>She wasn't on the afternoon walk, but she was back in her usual bed at night.</t1800> <t1801>We could hear her moaning throughout the night.</t1801>
<t1802>What did they do to her? we whispered, from bed to bed.</t1802>
<t1803>I don't know.</t1803>
<t1804>Not knowing is even worse.</t1804>
<t1805>I raise my hand, Aunt Lydia nods in approval.</t1805> <t1806>I get up and go out into the hall, as inconspicuously as possible.</t1806> <t1807>Aunt Elizabeth is standing guard outside the bathroom.</t1807> <t1808>She nods, indicating that I can go in.</t1808>
<t1809>This toilet used to be for men.</t1809> <t1810>The mirrors here have also been replaced with dull gray metal rectangles, but the urinals are still there, on one wall, made of white enamel with yellow stains.</t1810> <t1811>Strangely, they resemble baby coffins.</t1811> <t1812>The nakedness of male life surprises me again: showers are completely out in the open, bodies on display for examination and comparison, the exposure of private lives.</t1812> <t1813>Why do they do this?</t1813> <t1814>What purpose of reassurance does it serve?</t1814> <t1815>A momentary flash of a badge, hey everyone, look, everything is in place, I belong here.</t1815> <t1816>Why don't women need to prove to each other that they are women?</t1816> <t1817>Unbuttoning slightly, showing the crotch, as casually as men do.</t1817> <t1818>Dog-like, sniffing the air.</t1818>
<t1819>The high school is old, the partitions are made of wood, thin plywood.</t1819> <t1820>I enter the second to last one, pushing the door to close it.</t1820> <t1821>There is no lock or anything anymore, of course.</t1821> <t1822>In the wood, at the back, close to the wall, approximately at waist height, there is a small hole, a memory of a previous savagery or the legacy of an old voyeur.</t1822> <t1823>Everyone in the Center knows about this hole; everyone except the Aunts.</t1823>
<t1824>I'm afraid I'm very late, Janine's Confession delayed me: Maybe Moira has already come here, maybe she had to go back.</t1824> <t1825>They don't give people much time.</t1825> <t1826>I look down carefully, bending under the partition wall, and I see two red shoes there.</t1826> <t1827>But how can I know who it is?</t1827>
<t1828>I put my mouth to the wooden hole.</t1828> <t1829>Moira? I whisper.</t1829>
<t1830>Is it you? he says.</t1830>
<t1831>Yes, I say.</t1831> <t1832>I feel relieved.</t1832>
<t1833>God, how much I need a cigarette, says Moira.</t1833>
<t1834>Me too, I say.</t1834>
<t1835>I feel ridiculously happy.</t1835>
<t1836>I sink into my body as if sinking into a swamp whose paths only I know.</t1836> <t1837>Dangerous lands, my own territory.</t1837> <t1838>I become the ground to which I press my ear to hear the gossip of the future.</t1838> <t1839>Every torment, every insignificant whisper of pain, waves of waste matter, the swelling and shrinking of tissue, the body's contentment, these are signs, things I need to know.</t1839> <t1840>I wait for the blood to come every month, with fear, because its arrival signifies failure.</t1840> <t1841>Once again, I have failed to fulfill the expectations of others that I have adopted as my own.</t1841>
<t1842>I used to think of my body as a pleasure, a means of transport, or a tool for fulfilling my own desires.</t1842> <t1843>I would use my body to run, press buttons, make things happen in one way or another.</t1843> <t1844>There were limitations, but my body was still agile, unique, flesh and blood, one with me.</t1844>
<t1845>Now the body is organizing itself in a different way.</t1845> <t1846>I am a cloud, frozen around a central object, in the shape of a pear, harder and more real than I am, glowing red within its semi-transparent wrapping, with a void inside, as vast and dark as the night sky and as agile, more black-red than black.</t1846> <t1847>Countless points of light swell, sparkle, burst, and contract inside it, like stars.</t1847> <t1848>Every month there is a full moon, huge, round, heavy, a prophecy.</t1848> <t1849>It passes, pauses, continues, and disappears from sight, and I see despair, like hunger, coming towards me.</t1849> <t1850>To feel so empty, again, and again.</t1850> <t1851>I listen to my heart, wave after wave, salty and red, continuously moving, marking time.</t1851>
<t1852>I'm in our first apartment, in the bedroom.</t1852> <t1853>I'm standing in front of the closet with foldable wooden doors.</t1853> <t1854>I know the surroundings are empty, all the furniture is gone, the floors are bare, not even a carpet; but despite this, the closet is full of clothes.</t1854> <t1855>I think these are my clothes, but they don't look like mine, I've never seen them before.</t1855> <t1856>Maybe these clothes belong to Luke's wife, whom I've never seen either; just pictures and a voice on the phone, late at night, when she called us, crying, accusing, before the divorce.</t1856> <t1857>But no, these are my clothes.</t1857> <t1858>I need a dress, something to wear.</t1858> <t1859>I'm taking out the clothes, black, blue, purple, jackets, skirts; none of them are useful, none of them even fit, they're either too big or too small.</t1859>
<t1860>Luke is there, behind me, I turn around to see him.</t1860> <t1861>He is not looking at me, he is looking at the ground, where the cat is rubbing against his legs, whining and meowing.</t1861> <t1862>The cat wants its food, but in such an empty apartment, where could he find the food?</t1862>
<t1863>Luke, I say.</t1863> <t1864>He doesn't answer.</t1864> <t1865>Maybe he doesn't hear me.</t1865> <t1866>The thought that he might not be alive crosses my mind.</t1866>
<t1867>I am running, with my daughter, holding her hand, dragging her through the ferns, half-conscious from the pill I gave her, so she won't cry or say anything to give us away, my daughter doesn't know where she is.</t1867> <t1868>The ground is not even, stones, dead branches, the smell of damp soil, pale leaves, she can't run fast enough, I could run faster on my own, I am a good runner.</t1868> <t1869>Now she is crying, scared, I want to carry her, but she would be too heavy.</t1869> <t1870>My walking shoes are on my feet, I think I will have to take them off and throw them away when we reach the water, will it be too cold, can she swim that long, and what about the current, we didn't expect this.</t1870> <t1871>Be quiet, I say to her angrily.</t1871> <t1872>I think she will drown and this thought slows me down.</t1872> <t1873>Then gunshots come from behind us, not very loud, not like firecrackers, but sharp and definite like the crack of a dry branch.</t1873> <t1874>The sound I hear seems wrong to my ears, you never hear anything the way you think it will be and I hear that sound.</t1874> <t1875>Down, is it a real sound, a sound in my head, or my own voice expressed outwardly?</t1875>
<t1876>I pull her down to the ground and cover her to protect her, to shield her.</t1876> <t1877>Quiet, I say again, my face wet, whether from sweat or tears, I feel calm and as if floating, as if I am no longer inside my body; there is a leaf right by my eye, red, having changed color early, I can see every bright vein.</t1877> <t1878>The most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life.</t1878> <t1879>I relax, I don't want to suffocate her, instead I curl around her, covering her mouth with my hand.</t1879> <t1880>There are breaths and the beats of my heart, like knocking on the door of a house where you think you'll be safe at night.</t1880> <t1881>Everything is fine, I am here, I say, I whisper, Please be quiet, but how can she be quiet?</t1881> <t1882>So small, too late; they separate us, my arms are held and everything goes dark and nothing remains except a very small window, like looking through the wrong end of a telescope, like a window in an old Christmas card, night and ice outside, a candle inside, a shining tree, a family; I can even hear the bells, the jingles, the old music coming from the radio, but through this small but very clear window I can see my daughter, being taken away from me, through the trees that have started to turn red and yellow, reaching her arms out to me.</t1882>
<t1883>The bells wake me up; then Cora knocks on my door.</t1883> <t1884>I sit up straight on the rug, wiping my wet face with the sleeve of my dress.</t1884> <t1885>Of all the dreams, this is the worst one.</t1885>
<t1886>VI</t1886>
<t1887>House People</t1887>
<t1888>14</t1888>
<t1889>When the bell stops, I am descending the stairs, a fleeting image of a lonely person in the eye of the mirror hanging on the wall below.</t1889> <t1890>The clock ticks with its pendulum, working time; my feet in clean red shoes step down the stairs.</t1890>
<t1891>The living room door is wide open.</t1891> <t1892>I enter: she hasn't arrived yet.</t1892> <t1893>I'm not sitting, but I take my place, kneeling next to the stool chair where Serena will soon sit as if ascending a throne, leaning on her cane.</t1893> <t1894>Possibly, she will place one hand on my shoulder to settle herself, as if I were a piece of furniture.</t1894> <t1895>She had done this before.</t1895>
<t1896>It used to be called a guest room, probably, and then a parlor.</t1896> <t1897>Or maybe a lobby, the kind with spiders and flies.</t1897> <t1898>But now it is officially a living room, because that's what is done here, by some people.</t1898> <t1899>For others, it's just a standing room.</t1899> <t1900>The posture of the body is important, here and now: small discomforts are instructive.</t1900>
<t1901>The living room is dim and symmetrical; this is one of the forms money takes when it freezes.</t1901> <t1902>Money has flowed through this room for years, as if passing through an underground cave, shaping and hardening into these forms like stalactites.</t1902> <t1903>Different surfaces quietly reveal themselves: the dark rose velvet of the drawn curtains, the eighteenth-century sheen of the chairs matching the curtains' color, the cow-tongue flower silence of the fringed Chinese carpet on the floor with large-leaved peach-pink peonies, the pleasant leather of the Commander's chair, the gleam of the brass box beside it.</t1903>
<t1904>The carpet is genuine.</t1904> <t1905>Some of the items in this room are genuine, some are not.</t1905> <t1906>For example, the two portraits of women hanging on either side of the fireplace, both dressed in dark clothes similar to those of women in old churches, although these belong to a later period.</t1906> <t1907>The paintings are possibly real.</t1907> <t1908>After realizing that she needed to direct her energy towards something convincingly domestic, I suspect that Serena Joy acquired these with the intention of presenting them as ancestors.</t1908> <t1909>Or maybe they were in the house when the Commander bought it.</t1909> <t1910>There is no way of knowing these things.</t1910> <t1911>Anyway, there they hang, with their backs straight, mouths closed, chests tight, faces tense, starched bonnets, gray-white skin, and narrowed eyes observing the room.</t1911>
<t1912>Among them, on the mantelpiece, there is an oval mirror, with a silver candlestick with two arms on each side, and in the center, a Cupid made of white porcelain with its arm wrapped around a lamb's neck.</t1912> <t1913>Serana Joy's tastes consist of a strange mixture: a fierce appetite for quality alongside soft, sentimental desires.</t1913> <t1914>On each side of the fireplace, there are arrangements of dried flowers, and on the inlaid, elegant table next to the sofa, there is a vase with real daffodils.</t1914>
<t1915>The room smells of lemon oil, heavy fabric, wilting daffodils, leftover food odors that have found their way from the kitchen or dining room, and Serena Joy's perfume, which smells like Lily of the Valley.</t1915> <t1916>Perfume is a luxury, she must have a special source.</t1916> <t1917>I inhale this scent, thinking I should appreciate it.</t1917> <t1918>This is the scent of gifts given by young girls, not yet mature, to their mothers on Mother's Day; the scent of white cotton socks and white cotton petticoats, of dusting powder, of the innocence of a female body not yet given over to hair and blood.</t1918> <t1919>It makes me a little sick, as if I were in a closed car with an old woman overly powdered on a hot, stifling day.</t1919> <t1920>That's the sitting room, despite its elegance.</t1920>
<t1921>I would like to steal something from this room.</t1921> <t1922>I would like to take a small thing, the curved ashtray, maybe the small silver pillbox on the mantelpiece, or a dried flower: to hide it in the folds of my dress or the sleeve of my zippered dress, to keep it there until the night is over; to hide it in my room, under the bed, inside a tear in a shoe or a stiff FAITH pillow embroidered with canvas.</t1922> <t1923>Occasionally, I would take it out and look at it.</t1923> <t1924>It would make me feel powerful.</t1924>
<t1925>However, such a feeling would be an illusion and very risky.</t1925> <t1926>My hands remain where they are, clasped together, in my lap.</t1926> <t1927>My legs are together, my heels curled under me, pressing against my body.</t1927> <t1928>My head is bowed forward.</t1928> <t1929>The taste of toothpaste in my mouth: fake mint and plaster.</t1929>
<t1930>I am waiting for the household to gather.</t1930> <t1931>The household: this is who we are.</t1931> <t1932>The commander is the head of the household.</t1932> <t1933>The house is something held in hand.</t1933> <t1934>To own and to hold, until death do us part.</t1934>
<t1935>The hold of a ship that keeps its cargo.</t1935> <t1936>Void.</t1936>
<t1937>First, Cora comes, then Rita, wiping her hands on her apron.</t1937> <t1938>The bell called them too, they resent this, they have things to do, like washing dishes.</t1938> <t1939>But they need to be here, all of them need to be here, the Ceremony requires it.</t1939> <t1940>We all have to endure it, in one way or another.</t1940>
<t1941>Before entering to stand behind me, Rita frowns and looks at me.</t1941> <t1942>This is my fault, her time being wasted.</t1942> <t1943>Not mine, but my body's, if that counts as a difference.</t1943> <t1944>Even the Commander is subject to her whims.</t1944>
<t1945>Nick enters, nods at the three of us, and doesn't look around the room.</t1945> <t1946>He takes his place behind me, standing.</t1946> <t1947>He's so close that the tip of his boot touches my foot.</t1947> <t1948>Is he doing this on purpose?</t1948> <t1949>Whether he is or not, we are touching each other, two forms of skin.</t1949> <t1950>I feel my shoe softening, blood flows into it, it warms up, turning into skin.</t1950> <t1951>I slowly move my foot away from him.</t1951>
<t1952>“Hopefully, he will hurry,” says Cora.</t1952>
<t1953>“Hurry up and wait,” says Nick.</t1953> <t1954>He laughs, moves his foot so it touches mine again.</t1954> <t1955>No one can see this, under the folds of my skirt spread around.</t1955> <t1956>I move, it's very hot here, the smell of stale perfume makes me a bit nauseous.</t1956> <t1957>I pull my foot away.</t1957>
<t1958>We hear Serena coming, down the stairs, along the hall, the dull thud of her cane on the carpet, the thud of her good foot.</t1958> <t1959>She limps through the doorway, looks at us, counting but not seeing.</t1959> <t1960>She nods at Nick, but says nothing.</t1960> <t1961>She is wearing one of her best dresses, sky blue, with white embroidered edges on the veil: flowers and reliefs.</t1961> <t1962>Even at her age, she still feels the urge to adorn herself with flowers.</t1962> <t1963>You naughty girl, I think, looking at her, my face motionless, you can't use them anymore, you have withered.</t1963> <t1964>These are the sexual organs of flowers.</t1964> <t1965>I read it somewhere, once upon a time.</t1965>
<t1966>He moves towards his chair and stool, turns around, lowers himself, and settles in with an inelegant motion.</t1966> <t1967>He places his left foot on the stool and rummages through the pocket of his coat sleeve.</t1967> <t1968>I can hear the rustling, the click of his lighter, the smoke, the warm burnt smell, I inhale it.</t1968>
<t1969>“As usual, she is late,” he says.</t1969> <t1970>We do not respond.</t1970> <t1971>When he reaches for the lamped table, a clatter is heard, followed by a click, and the television starts to warm up.</t1971>
<t1972>A men's choir, their skin greenish-yellow, the color needs adjustment, singing the song "Come to the Church in the Forest."</t1972> <t1973>Come, come, come, come say the basses.</t1973> <t1974>Serena presses the remote control.</t1974> <t1975>Waves, colorful zigzags, crackles: the blocked Montreal satellite station.</t1975> <t1976>Then a preacher, serious, with shining black eyes, leaning towards us from over a table.</t1976> <t1977>These days they look a lot like businessmen.</t1977> <t1978>Serena gives him a few seconds, then continues pressing.</t1978>
<t1979>A few empty channels, then the news.</t1979> <t1980>This is what he was looking for.</t1980> <t1981>He leans back and takes a deep drag from his cigarette.</t1981> <t1982>In contrast, I lean forward, like a child allowed to stay up late with the grown-ups.</t1982> <t1983>One of the good things about these evenings, these Ceremony evenings, is this; we are allowed to watch the news.</t1983> <t1984>It's like an unspoken rule in this house: We always arrive here on time, he always late, and Serena always lets us watch the news.</t1984>
<t1985>Although it doesn't really matter: who knows if these news are true or not?</t1985> <t1986>They could be old records, they could be fake.</t1986> <t1987>Still, I watch, hoping I can read between the lines.</t1987> <t1988>Any news, now, is better than none.</t1988>
<t1989>First of all, the fronts.</t1989> <t1990>These are not really fronts: it seems like the war is continuing in many places at the same time.</t1990>
<t1991>The tree-covered hills, from above, look like trees are sick with epilepsy. Serena wishes she could adjust the color.</t1991> <t1992>The Appalachian Mountains, where the Light Angels' Twenty-First Battalion, with air support, and the Revelation Angels' Fourth Company uncovered a Baptist guerrilla group, says the voice on the television.</t1992> <t1993>We are shown two black helicopters with silver wings painted on their sides.</t1993> <t1994>A cluster of trees is flying in the air beneath them.</t1994>
<t1995>Now, a close-up shot of a bearded and dirty-faced prisoner between two Angels in clean black uniforms.</t1995> <t1996>The prisoner takes the cigarette held by one of the Angels and clumsily places it to his lips with his bound hands.</t1996> <t1997>A small crooked grin spreads across his face.</t1997> <t1998>The announcer is saying something, but I can't hear: I'm looking into this man's eyes, trying to understand what he's thinking.</t1998> <t1999>He knows the camera is on him: Is this grin a show of defiance, or surrender?</t1999> <t2000>Is he surprised to have been caught?</t2000>
<t2001>They only show us victories, never defeats.</t2001> <t2002>Who wants bad news anyway?</t2002>
<t2003>Maybe he is an actor.</t2003>
<t2004>Now it's the main anchor's turn.</t2004> <t2005>His demeanor is compassionate, fatherly; he looks at us from the screen, with his sunburnt skin and white hair and sincere eyes surrounded by wise wrinkles, he resembles everyone's ideal grandfather.</t2005> <t2006>As his measured smile implies, what he tells us is for our own good.</t2006> <t2007>I promise, everything will be fixed in the lie.</t2007> <t2008>There will be peace.</t2008> <t2009>You must trust.</t2009> <t2010>It's time to sleep, come on to bed, like good children.</t2010>
<t2011>It tells us the things we desire to believe in.</t2011> <t2012>Very convincing.</t2012>
<t2013>I am struggling with him.</t2013> <t2014>He looks like an old movie star, I tell myself, with false teeth and a fake face.</t2014> <t2015>At the same time, I lean towards him as if hypnotized.</t2015> <t2016>If only these were true.</t2016> <t2017>If only I could believe.</t2017>
<t2018>Now, it tells us about an underground espionage organization that was dismantled by an Eye team working with an informant inside.</t2018> <t2019>This organization was smuggling valuable national resources to Canada through customs.</t2019>
<t2020>“Five members of a heretical sect of Quakers have been arrested,” he says with a gentle smile.</t2020> <t2021>“And more arrests are expected.</t2021><t2022>”</t2022>
<t2023>Two Quakers appear on the screen, a man and a woman.</t2023> <t2024>They look horrified, but they are trying to maintain some dignity in front of the camera.</t2024> <t2025>The man has a dark, long scar on his forehead; the woman's veil is torn to shreds, and her hair falls in strands over her face.</t2025> <t2026>Both are in their fifties.</t2026>
<t2027>Now we see a city, again from the air.</t2027> <t2028>This used to be Detroit.</t2028> <t2029>The rumble of cannons can be heard behind the announcer's voice.</t2029> <t2030>Columns of smoke rise from the horizon.</t2030>
<t2031>“The relocation process of Ham's Children is proceeding according to plan,” says the reassuring pink face that appears on the screen again.</t2031> <t2032>“This week, three thousand people arrived at National Homeland No 1, and two thousand are on the way.”</t2032> <t2033>I wonder how they transport so many people at once?</t2033> <t2034>By train, by bus?</t2034> <t2035>Nothing is shown about this.</t2035> <t2036>National Homeland No 1 is in North Dakota.</t2036> <t2037>God knows what is expected of them when they get there.</t2037> <t2038>The theory is farming.</t2038>
<t2039>Serena Joy must have had enough of the news.</t2039> <t2040>She impatiently presses the button to change the station, and an aging bass-baritone with cheeks resembling deflated cow udders appears.</t2040> <t2041>The song he sings is "Whispering Hope."</t2041> <t2042>Serena turns it off.</t2042>
<t2043>We are waiting, the clock in the hall is ticking, Serena lights another cigarette, and I get into the car.</t2043> <t2044>A Saturday morning, a September month, we still have a car.</t2044> <t2045>Others had to sell their cars.</t2045> <t2046>My name is not Fred's, I have another name, no one uses it anymore because it's forbidden.</t2046> <t2047>I tell myself that it doesn't matter, that a name is like a phone number, only useful to others, but that's not true, it actually matters.</t2047> <t2048>I keep the existence of my name like a secret, a treasure I will dig up and uncover one day.</t2048> <t2049>I think this name is buried.</t2049> <t2050>This name is surrounded by an aura of mystery, like a talisman, a spell from an unimaginably distant past.</t2050> <t2051>I lie in my single bed at night, eyes closed, and the name glows in the dark, moving behind my eyes, but not close enough to reach.</t2051>
<t2052>On a Saturday morning in September, I carry my shining name.</t2052> <t2053>The little girl who is now dead sits in the back seat, with her two best dolls and a frozen rabbit worn out from years and love.</t2053> <t2054>I know all the details.</t2054> <t2055>These are emotional details, but there's nothing I can do.</t2055> <t2056>Still, I can't think about the rabbit for too long, as I inhale the smoke that has passed through Serena's body, here on the Chinese rug, I can't start crying.</t2056> <t2057>Not here, not now, I can do that later.</t2057>
<t2058>He thought we were going on a picnic, and indeed, there was a picnic basket on the back seat next to him, containing real food, that is, hard-boiled eggs, a thermos, and everything.</t2058> <t2059>We didn't want him to know where we were really going, to tell if we were stopped, to explain everything unintentionally.</t2059> <t2060>We didn't want to burden him with the weight of our reality.</t2060>
<t2061>I had put on my hiking boots, and he had put on his rubber shoes.</t2061> <t2062>There were hearts on the laces of the rubber shoes, red, purple, pink, and yellow.</t2062> <t2063>The weather was warm for this time of year, some leaves had already started to change color; Luke was driving the car, and I was sitting next to him, the sun was shining, the sky was blue, the houses looked comfortable and familiar as we passed by them, and as the houses were left behind, they disappeared into the past, crumbling in an instant as if they had never existed, because I thought I would never see them again—or so I thought at the time.</t2063>
<t2064>There is almost nothing with us, we don't want to look like we are going far away or going somewhere permanently.</t2064> <t2065>The fake passports are with us, guaranteed, worth the money we paid.</t2065> <t2066>We couldn't pay in cash, of course, nor could we give it to Kompükaunt.</t2066> <t2067>We used other things, a few of my grandmother's jewels, the stamp collection Luke inherited from his uncle.</t2067> <t2068>These kinds of things can be converted into money in other countries.</t2068> <t2069>When we get to the border, we will pretend we are just going on a day trip; the fake visas are only for one day.</t2069> <t2070>Before that, I will give him a sleeping pill, so he will be asleep while we cross the border.</t2070> <t2071>That way, he won't give us away.</t2071> <t2072>You can't expect a child to lie convincingly.</t2072>
<t2073>Moreover, I don't want him to feel the fear that makes my muscles tense, my spine stiffen, and keeps me so on edge that I'm sure I'll break if touched.</t2073> <t2074>Every red traffic light is a test of endurance.</t2074> <t2075>We'll spend the night in a motel or, better yet, sleeping in the car on a side road, so there won't be any suspicious questions.</t2075> <t2076>In the morning, we'll cross the border, over the bridge, just like going to the supermarket.</t2076>
<t2077>We turn onto the bypass road with little traffic, heading north.</t2077> <t2078>Because the war has started, gasoline is expensive and scarce.</t2078> <t2079>We pass the first checkpoint outside the city.</t2079> <t2080>All they want is to check the license; Luke handles this well.</t2080> <t2081>The license matches the passport: We had thought of this.</t2081>
<t2082>When we return to the road, Luke squeezes my hand and looks at me.</t2082> <t2083>You're as white as a sheet, he says.</t2083>
<t2084>I feel exactly like this: white, flat, thin.</t2084> <t2085>It feels like I'm transparent.</t2085> <t2086>I'm sure they will understand what goes through me.</t2086> <t2087>It's bad; how will I stay loyal to Luke, to my daughter, when I'm so flat, so white?</t2087> <t2088>I feel like there's not much left of me; they will slip through my arms, as if I'm made of smoke, as if I'm a mirage, disappearing right before their eyes.</t2088> <t2089>Don't think like that, Moira would say.</t2089> <t2090>As you think, so shall it be.</t2090>
<t2091>Come on, cheer up, says Luke.</t2091> <t2092>Now he's driving a bit too fast.</t2092> <t2093>The adrenaline has gone to his head.</t2093> <t2094>Now he's singing.</t2094> <t2095>Oh what a beautiful morning, he sings.</t2095>
<t2096>Even its song makes me anxious.</t2096> <t2097>We were warned not to appear overly happy.</t2097>
<t2098>15</t2098>
<t2099>The Commander is knocking on the door.</t2099> <t2100>That's the rule: The living room is assumed to be Serena Joy's territory, and the Commander needs to ask for permission to enter.</t2100> <t2101>Serena Joy likes to keep him waiting.</t2101> <t2102>It's a small thing, but even small things are very important in this house.</t2102> <t2103>But tonight, she can't savor it, because the Commander enters the room before Serena Joy can even open her mouth.</t2103> <t2104>Maybe he just forgot the protocol, or maybe he did it on purpose.</t2104> <t2105>Who can tell what Serena Joy said to him over the dinner table adorned with silverware?</t2105> <t2106>Or what she didn't say.</t2106>
<t2107>On the Commander, there is a black uniform in which he resembles a museum guard.</t2107> <t2108>A semi-retired man, pleasant but cautious, busy killing time.</t2108> <t2109>But this impression only comes at first glance.</t2109> <t2110>After that, with his straight and carefully combed silvery hair, measured posture, and slightly slouched shoulders, he resembles a Midwestern bank president.</t2110> <t2111>Then there's his silvery mustache and, following that, his chin, which you really can't miss.</t2111> <t2112>By the time you get this far, you might compare him to models in a vodka advertisement from a bygone era's glossy magazine.</t2112>
<t2113>His behaviors are soft, his hands with thick fingers and greedy thumbs have a large, false harmlessness, and his blue eyes are uncommunicative.</t2113> <t2114>As if taking inventory, he scrutinizes us one by one.</t2114> <t2115>A woman kneeling in red, another sitting in blue, two in green standing, and a single man with a thin face in the background.</t2115> <t2116>He manages to look surprised, as if he doesn't quite remember how we all got here.</t2116> <t2117>As if we are something inherited by him, like a Victorian organ, and he hasn't decided what to do with us yet.</t2117> <t2118>What our value is.</t2118>
<t2119>He nods slightly towards Serena Joy, but she remains silent.</t2119> <t2120>He moves towards the large leather chair assigned to him, takes the key out of his pocket, and reaches for the ornate brass-bound, leather-covered box next to the chair.</t2120> <t2121>He inserts the key into the lock and opens the box, taking out an ordinary Bible with a black cover and gold-gilded page edges.</t2121> <t2122>The Bible is kept under lock and key, just as people used to keep tea locked up to prevent servants from stealing it.</t2122> <t2123>This is very cunning: Even if we could touch the Bible, who knows what we would do with it?</t2123> <t2124>Something from the Bible can be read to us by the Commander, but we cannot read it on our own.</t2124> <t2125>Our heads turn towards him, eagerly waiting; it's time for our bedtime story.</t2125>
<t2126>While being watched by us, the Commander sits down and crosses his legs.</t2126> <t2127>The bookmarks are in place.</t2127> <t2128>He opens the book.</t2128> <t2129>He clears his throat, as if bored.</t2129>
<t2130>"Can I have a glass of water?" he says out loud.</t2130> <t2131>"Please," he adds.</t2131>
<t2132>Someone behind me, either Cora or Rita, quietly leaves their place at the table and walks towards the kitchen.</t2132> <t2133>The Commander sits with his head bowed.</t2133> <t2134>He sighs, takes out a pair of gold-framed reading glasses from the inner pocket of his jacket, and puts them on.</t2134> <t2135>Now he looks like a cobbler from an old fairy tale.</t2135> <t2136>Is there no end to the angel of mercy masks he constantly changes?</t2136>
<t2137>We are watching him: down to the millimeter, even the slightest movement.</t2137>
<t2138>To be a man, watched by women.</t2138> <t2139>It must be entirely strange.</t2139> <t2140>To always make women watch him.</t2140> <t2141>To make them wonder, what will he do next.</t2141> <t2142>When he moves, even if it's a very harmless movement, like reaching for an ashtray, to startle the women.</t2142> <t2143>To make them measure and evaluate every move.</t2143> <t2144>To make them think, he can't do this, he won't do this, he will have to do this, like a garment that must be worn out of necessity, outdated and shabby.</t2144>
<t2145>To have women dress him, inspect him, measure him, while he dresses them as easily as putting on a sock, to touch the protrusion of his body, his overly sensitive big toe, his touch, the fragile stalked eye of a snail, protruding, expanding, recoiling in fear, retracting back into itself when touched by mistake, moving towards them, eager to see, advancing as if on a leaf, revealing a bit at the tip and then growing again.</t2145> <t2146>The idea of obtaining in this way, making this journey towards the darkness formed by a woman, from women who can see in the dark while he blindly lunges forward.</t2146>
<t2147>Serena Joy is watching him from the inside.</t2147> <t2148>We are all watching.</t2148> <t2149>It's really the only thing we can do, and it's not for nothing: If he were to stumble, fail, or die, what would become of us?</t2149> <t2150>It's not surprising that he is like a boot, hard on the outside, but shaping to a soft foot.</t2150> <t2151>This is just a wish.</t2151> <t2152>I've been watching him for a while and he hasn't shown any signs of softness.</t2152>
<t2153>But be careful, Commander, I say in my head.</t2153> <t2154>I'm watching you.</t2154>
<t2155>One wrong move and I'm dead.</t2155>
<t2156>Still, it must be like hell to be a man in this way.</t2156>
<t2157>It must be quite pleasant.</t2157>
<t2158>It must be like hell.</t2158>
<t2159>It must be very quiet.</t2159>
<t2160>The water came, the Commander is drinking.</t2160> <t2161>"Thank you," he says.</t2161> <t2162>Cora returns to her place with a rustle.</t2162>
<t2163>With his head bowed, the Commander pauses as he reviews the page.</t2163> <t2164>He is not in a hurry, as if he is unaware of our presence.</t2164> <t2165>He resembles a man playing with his steak, pretending not to see the eyes watching him from the hungry darkness just a meter away behind a restaurant window.</t2165> <t2166>We lean towards him a bit, like iron filings caught by his magnet.</t2166> <t2167>He possesses something we do not have, the power of speech.</t2167> <t2168>How we used to squander it, once upon a time.</t2168>
<t2169>Familiar story, familiar stories.</t2169><t2170>God to Adam, God to Noah.</t2170><t2171>Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.</t2171><t2172>Then comes that old Rachel and Leah nonsense we were filled with at the Center.</t2172><t2173>Give me children, or else I die.</t2173><t2174>Am I in the place of God, who has withheld the fruit of the womb from you?</t2174><t2175>Here is my maid Bilhah.</t2175><t2176>Let her bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.</t2176><t2177>Et cetera, et cetera.</t2177><t2178>This was read to us while we sat in the high school cafeteria eating mush with cream and brown sugar, every breakfast.</t2178><t2179>You know you're getting the best, Aunt Lydia would say.</t2179><t2180>There's a war out there, everything is rationed.</t2180><t2181>You're bad girls; her eye twitching, like scolding a kitten.</t2181><t2182>Bad kitty, bad kitty.</t2182>
<t2183>At lunch, Absolute Bliss3 was read.</t2183> <t2184>How happy I am, how happy he/she is.</t2184> <t2185>They played this from a disc, the voice belonged to a man.</t2185> <t2186>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</t2186> <t2187>Blessed are the merciful.</t2187> <t2188>Blessed are the meek.</t2188> <t2189>Blessed are the peacemakers.</t2189> <t2190>I knew they made these up, I knew it was wrong, and I also knew they skipped some words in between, but there was no way to check it.</t2190> <t2191>Blessed are those who mourn; for they shall be comforted.</t2191>
<t2192>No one could say when this would happen.</t2192>
<t2193>I'm checking the time while eating the standard lunch of cinnamon canned pears.</t2193> <t2194>I look over to where Moira is sitting, two tables away.</t2194> <t2195>She's already gone.</t2195> <t2196>I raise my hand, permission is granted.</t2196> <t2197>We do this very often, always at different times of the day.</t2197>
<t2198>I enter the second-to-last stall in the restroom, as usual.</t2198>
<t2199>Are you there, I whisper.</t2199>
<t2200>As big as life and twice as ugly, Moira whispers back.</t2200>
<t2201>What did you hear? I ask him.</t2201>
<t2202>It's not much.</t2202> <t2203>I need to get out of here, I'm about to go crazy.</t2203>
<t2204>I panic.</t2204> <t2205>No, no, Moira, I say, don't try this.</t2205> <t2206>It won't work on its own.</t2206>
<t2207>I will pretend to be a patient.</t2207> <t2208>They are sending an ambulance, I have seen it before.</t2208>
<t2209>However, you can only reach the hospital.</t2209>
<t2210>At least it would be a change.</t2210> <t2211>I wouldn't have to listen to that old whore.</t2211>
<t2212>They will understand what you are doing.</t2212>
<t2213>Don't worry, I can handle this well.</t2213> <t2214>When I was in high school, I stopped taking vitamin C and got scurvy.</t2214> <t2215>They can't diagnose it in the early stages.</t2215> <t2216>Then you start taking vitamin C again and you get better.</t2216> <t2217>I'll hide my vitamin pills.</t2217>
<t2218>Moira, don't.</t2218>
<t2219>I couldn't bear the thought of him not staying here with me, for me.</t2219>
<t2220>They are sending two men with you, in the ambulance.</t2220> <t2221>Just think about it.</t2221> <t2222>They must be dying for it, damn it, they aren't even allowed to put their hands in their pockets, the possibilities -</t2222>
<t2223>You inside.</t2223> <t2224>Your time is up, said Aunt Elizabeth's voice from the door.</t2224> <t2225>I got up, flushed the toilet.</t2225> <t2226>Moira's two fingers appeared in the hole in the wall.</t2226> <t2227>It was a hole that could only fit two fingers.</t2227> <t2228>I touched my fingers to hers, held them quickly.</t2228> <t2229>I let go.</t2229>
<t2230>“And Leah said: God has given me my reward, because I gave my maid to my husband,” says the Commander.</t2230> <t2231>He closes the book.</t2231> <t2232>A tired sound emerges, much like the muffled closing of a door from a certain distance: an air current.</t2232> <t2233>The sound evokes the softness of the thin onion-skin-like pages, how they would feel between fingers.</t2233> <t2234>Soft and dry, like papier poudre, pink and powdery, from a previous time, used to eliminate shine on the nose, found in brochures, in those shops selling candles and soaps shaped in various forms: seashells, like mushrooms.</t2234> <t2235>Like cigarette paper.</t2235> <t2236>Like flower petals.</t2236>
<t2237>For a moment, the Commander is sitting with his eyes closed, as if he is tired.</t2237> <t2238>He works for hours.</t2238> <t2239>He has many responsibilities.</t2239>
<t2240>Serena started crying.</t2240> <t2241>I can hear her behind me.</t2241> <t2242>This is not the first time.</t2242> <t2243>She always does this on Ceremony night.</t2243> <t2244>She tries not to make noise.</t2244> <t2245>She tries to maintain her dignity in front of us.</t2245> <t2246>The floor and the carpets muffle her sound, but even so, we can hear her clearly.</t2246> <t2247>The tension from her losing control and trying to suppress it is terrible.</t2247> <t2248>It's like farting in church.</t2248> <t2249>As always, I feel an unbearable urge to laugh, but not because I think it's funny.</t2249> <t2250>The smell of her crying spreads over us, and we pretend to ignore it.</t2250>
<t2251>The commander opens his eyes, becomes aware, frowns, and relinquishes his awareness.</t2251> <t2252>“Now we will pray silently,” he says.</t2252> <t2253>We will pray for God's grace and for Him to make us successful in all our endeavors.</t2253><t2254>”</t2254>
<t2255>I lower my head and close my eyes.</t2255> <t2256>I listen to the held breaths, the almost inaudible sighs, the tremors occurring behind me.</t2256> <t2257>Serena Joy must hate me so much, I think.</t2257>
<t2258>I pray silently: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t2258> <t2259>I don't know what it means, but it sounds right to me, and that should be enough, because I don't know what else to say to God.</t2259> <t2260>Not now.</t2260> <t2261>As they used to say, not in this tender moment.</t2261> <t2262>On the wall of my closet, the scribbled writing left by an unknown woman with Moira's face keeps floating before my eyes.</t2262> <t2263>I had seen her being taken out, on a stretcher carried by two Angels, into the ambulance.</t2263>
<t2264>What's happening? I quietly asked the woman next to me; a question that could be asked to anyone except a fanatic.</t2264>
<t2265>They said he had a fever, and he moved his lips.</t2265> <t2266>They say it's appendicitis.</t2266>
<t2267>That evening I was having dinner, there were hamburger patties and grated potatoes.</t2267> <t2268>My table was near the window, I could see the area up to the front doors.</t2268> <t2269>I saw the ambulance return, this time the sirens were not blaring.</t2269> <t2270>One of the Angels jumped out and talked to the guards.</t2270> <t2271>The guard entered the building; the ambulance stayed parked where it was; the Angel's back was turned to us, as they were taught.</t2271> <t2272>Two of the Aunts came out of the building with the guard.</t2272> <t2273>They went to the back of the ambulance.</t2273> <t2274>They pulled Moira out and each took her by an armpit, dragging her inside the door and up the stairs.</t2274> <t2275>She was having difficulty walking.</t2275> <t2276>I stopped eating, I couldn't eat; meanwhile, everyone on my side of the table was looking out the window.</t2276> <t2277>The window was greenish, because of the chicken wire they had put inside the glass.</t2277> <t2278>Aunt Lydia said, Eat your dinner.</t2278> <t2279>And came and lowered the blind.</t2279>
<t2280>They took Moira to a room that used to be the Science Laboratory.</t2280> <t2281>A room none of us wanted to go to willingly.</t2281> <t2282>Afterwards, she couldn't walk for a week, her feet wouldn't fit into her shoes, they were so swollen.</t2282> <t2283>For the first offense, they would do things to your feet.</t2283> <t2284>They used steel cables with frayed ends.</t2284> <t2285>After that, to your hands.</t2285> <t2286>They didn't care what they did to your feet and hands, even if it was permanent.</t2286> <t2287>Remember, Aunt Lydia would say.</t2287> <t2288>Your feet and hands are not important for our purposes.</t2288>
<t2289>Moira was lying in her bed, an example.</t2289> <t2290>She shouldn't have tried it, at least not with the Angels, said Alma from the next bed.</t2290> <t2291>We had to carry her to the classes.</t2291> <t2292>We stole extra sugar packets from the cafeteria for her during meal times, and we delivered them to her secretly, passing them from bed to bed at night.</t2292> <t2293>She didn't really need the sugar, but it was the only thing we could find to steal.</t2293> <t2294>To give her.</t2294>
<t2295>I'm still praying, but what I see are Moira's feet, the way they looked when they brought her back.</t2295> <t2296>Her feet didn't look like feet at all.</t2296> <t2297>They looked like drowned feet, swollen and boneless, only their color was different.</t2297> <t2298>They looked like lungs.</t2298>
<t2299>Oh God, I pray.</t2299> <t2300>Don't let the bastards grind you down.</t2300>
<t2301>Is this what you were thinking?</t2301>
<t2302>The commander clears his throat.</t2302> <t2303>This is something he does to show us that the time has come to stop praying, according to him.</t2303> <t2304>“For the eyes of the Lord roam throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him,” he says.</t2304> <t2305>This is the sign of the end.</t2305> <t2306>The commander stands up.</t2306> <t2307>We have been dismissed.</t2307>
<t2308>16</t2308>
<t2309>The ritual is taking place as usual.</t2309>
<t2310>Except for my healthy white cotton underwear, I am lying on my back fully clothed.</t2310> <t2311>If I could open my eyes, what I would see would be the wide white canopy of Serena Joy's huge colonial-style four-poster bed, hanging above us like a cloud adorned with small silver raindrops, which, if you look closely, turn into four-petaled flowers.</t2311> <t2312>I wouldn't see the white carpet or the curtains decorated with thin branches, the covered dressing table with the silver-backed brush and mirror set; all I could see would be the canopy, which, with the fineness of its weave and the heavy drape it makes downward, manages to remind one of both spirituality and materiality at the same time.</t2312>
<t2313>Or the sail of a ship.</t2313> <t2314>In poems, they used to say sails with swollen bellies.</t2314> <t2315>To belly.</t2315> <t2316>To be propelled forward by a swollen belly.</t2316>
<t2317>Serin, almost sharp Lily of the Valley mist surrounds us.</t2317> <t2318>The room is not very warm.</t2318>
<t2319>Above me, towards the head of the bed, Serena Joy has taken her place, sprawled out.</t2319> <t2320>Her legs are open, I am lying between them, my head on her stomach, her pubic bone under my head, and her hips on either side of me.</t2320> <t2321>She is also fully dressed.</t2321>
<t2322>My arms are raised; my hands are in hers, she is holding my hands.</t2322> <t2323>This signifies that we are a single body, a single entity.</t2323> <t2324>The real meaning is this: Serena is the one in control; she holds the control of the process and thus the product.</t2324> <t2325>If a product is to be produced, of course.</t2325> <t2326>The rings on her left hand are digging into my fingers.</t2326> <t2327>This may or may not be an act of revenge.</t2327>
<t2328>My red skirt is lifted up to my waist, but no higher.</t2328> <t2329>Below, the Commander is fucking.</t2329> <t2330>He's fucking the lower part of my body.</t2330> <t2331>I'm not saying he's making love, because that's not what he's doing.</t2331> <t2332>It wouldn't be right to say he's mating either, because that would imply the presence of two people, but there's only one person involved in this.</t2332> <t2333>Nor does it fit the definition of rape: There's nothing happening here that I don't want.</t2333> <t2334>The options weren't many, but there were a few, and this is the one I chose.</t2334>
<t2335>Therefore, I lie still and visualize the invisible dome above my head.</t2335> <t2336>I remember the advice Queen Victoria gave to her daughter.</t2336> <t2337>Close your eyes and think of England.</t2337> <t2338>But it's not about England.</t2338> <t2339>I wish they would hurry up a bit.</t2339>
<t2340>Maybe I am crazy and this is a new type of therapy.</t2340>
<t2341>I wish this were true; that way I would heal and this event would pass.</t2341>
<t2342>Serena Joy is squeezing my hands, as if it is not me being fucked but her, as if she is the one finding it pleasurable or painful, and the Commander keeps fucking, like a dripping faucet without pause, with a steady one-two marching rhythm.</t2342> <t2343>The Commander's mind is elsewhere, like a man who hums to himself in the shower without realizing it; like a man with other things on his mind.</t2343> <t2344>As if he were somewhere else, waiting for his own release, drumming his fingers on the table while he waits.</t2344> <t2345>There is an impatience in his rhythm now.</t2345> <t2346>But isn't this everyone's sexual fantasy, two women at once?</t2346> <t2347>They used to say that.</t2347> <t2348>Exciting, they used to say.</t2348>
<t2349>What happens under Serena Joy's silvery dome in this room is not exciting.</t2349> <t2350>It has nothing to do with passion or love or romance or all those thoughts we used to get carried away with.</t2350> <t2351>It has nothing to do with sexual desire, at least not for me and certainly not for Serena Joy.</t2351> <t2352>Arousal and orgasm are no longer deemed necessary; they are considered mere signs of frivolity, like flashy garters or beauty marks placed on the face: unnecessary deviations for the shallow-minded.</t2352> <t2353>Out of fashion.</t2353> <t2354>It seems strange to think that women once spent so much time and energy reading about, thinking about, worrying about, and \ getting aroused by these kinds of things.</t2354> <t2355>It's so obvious that they were just for fun.</t2355>
<t2356>This is not entertainment, even for the Commander.</t2356> <t2357>It's a serious job.</t2357> <t2358>The Commander is also doing his duty.</t2358>
<t2359>If I were to open my eyes a little, I could see him, suspended above my body, with a few strands of silver hair falling on his forehead, making his journey with all his attention focused on that place he was hastily heading to, as if in a dream, his not unpleasant face.</t2359> <t2360>I would see his open eyes.</t2360>
<t2361>If he were more handsome, would I like this job more?</t2361>
<t2362>Like a church vestibule in the rain, like your mouth when the dentist starts drilling your tooth, at least it's an improvement over the previous one that smelled like a nostril.</t2362> <t2363>But this Commander smells like mothballs, or is this scent a form of punishment from his aftershave?</t2363> <t2364>Why does he have to wear this stupid uniform?</t2364> <t2365>Well, would I prefer it more than his white, withered, raw body?</t2365>
<t2366>Kissing is forbidden between us.</t2366> <t2367>This makes the situation bearable.</t2367>
<t2368>Man distances himself.</t2368> <t2369>He begins to define.</t2369>
<t2370>Finally, he comes, as if relieved, with a muffled groan.</t2370> <t2371>Serena Joy exhales.</t2371> <t2372>The Commander, supporting himself on his elbows away from our united bodies, takes care not to collapse onto us.</t2372> <t2373>He rests for a moment, withdraws, pulls back, and zips up.</t2373> <t2374>He shakes his head, then turns and leaves the room, closing the door with exaggerated care as if we were both his sick mothers.</t2374> <t2375>There is something ridiculous about this, but I don't dare to laugh.</t2375>
<t2376>Serena Joy lets go of my hands.</t2376> <t2377>"You can get up now," she says.</t2377> <t2378>"Get up and leave."</t2378> <t2379>To increase the chances, I actually need to rest for ten minutes with my feet on a pillow.</t2379> <t2380>This means a time of silent meditation for her, but she's not in the mood for it.</t2380> <t2381>There is hatred in her voice, as if the touch of my body makes her sick and dirty.</t2381> <t2382>I disentangle myself from her body and get up; the Commander's fluid trickles down my legs.</t2382> <t2383>Before I turn, I see her adjusting her blue skirt, crossing her legs; she continues to lie on the bed, as rigid and upright as a statue, looking up at the dome.</t2383>
<t2384>Which one of us is this worse for, him or me?</t2384>
<t2385>17</t2385>
<t2386>When I return to my room, these are the things I do:</t2386>
<t2387>I take off my dress and put on my nightgown.</t2387>
<t2388>After dinner, I take out a piece of butter that I had hidden in my right shoe.</t2388> <t2389>The cupboard was very warm, the butter is half melted.</t2389> <t2390>Most of the butter has been absorbed by the paper napkin I wrapped it in.</t2390> <t2391>Now there is butter inside my shoe.</t2391> <t2392>This is not the first time, because whenever there is butter, or even margarine, I save a bit this way.</t2392> <t2393>I can get most of the butter out of the shoe lining with a napkin or the toilet paper from the bathroom tomorrow.</t2393>
<t2394>I am rubbing butter on my face, thoroughly working it into the skin of my hands.</t2394> <t2395>There is no more hand lotion or face cream, not for us.</t2395> <t2396>These things are considered to be frivolous.</t2396> <t2397>We are vessels, the only important thing is the inside of our bodies.</t2397> <t2398>The outside can be hard and wrinkled, that's what they think, like the shell of a nut.</t2398> <t2399>The Wives decided this, this lack of hand lotion.</t2399> <t2400>They don't want us to look attractive.</t2400> <t2401>Things are bad enough for them as it is.</t2401>
<t2402>A trick I learned at the Rahel and Lea Center is buttering.</t2402> <t2403>We used to call it the Red Center because there was so much red.</t2403> <t2404>The predecessor in this room, my freckled and beautiful-smiled friend, must have done this too, this buttering.</t2404> <t2405>We all do this.</t2405>
<t2406>As long as we do this, that is, as long as we oil ourselves to keep our skin soft, we can continue to believe that one day we can go outside, that we will be touched again, with love or desire.</t2406> <t2407>We have our own rituals, special things.</t2407>
<t2408>The butter has chirped, it will sour and I will smell like moldy cheese; as they used to say, at least an organic smell.</t2408>
<t2409>We have stooped to such things.</t2409>
<t2410>Greased up, I lie in my single bed, flat as a piece of toast.</t2410> <t2411>I can't sleep.</t2411> <t2412>Despite not being able to see in the semi-darkness, I look at the plastered, blind eye staring at me from the center of the ceiling.</t2412> <t2413>There's no breeze, my white curtains hang loosely like transparent bandages, glowing with the light emitted by the spotlights that illuminate this house at night, or is it a full moon?</t2413>
<t2414>I pull the sheet over me, carefully get up, and on my silent bare feet, in my nightgown, I go to the window, wanting to see just like a child.</t2414> <t2415>The moon, new, in the bosom of the fallen snow.</t2415> <t2416>The sky is clear but hard to distinguish because of the spotlight; but yes, there is indeed a moon floating in the indistinct sky, a brand new, yearning moon, an ancient piece of rock, a goddess, a glimmer.</t2416> <t2417>The moon is a rock and the sky is filled with deadly weapons; oh my God, yet how beautiful it is!</t2417>
<t2418>I desperately want Luke here.</t2418> <t2419>I want to be hugged and have my name spoken.</t2419> <t2420>I want to be valued in ways I am not; I want more than just to be valuable.</t2420> <t2421>I repeat my old name, reminding myself of what I once could do, how others saw me.</t2421>
<t2422>I want to steal something.</t2422>
<t2423>The night light is on, the long void glows with a sweet pink; I walk, carefully placing one foot on the ground, then the other, without creaking, along the runner, as if on a forest floor, stealthily, my heart pounding, inside the house at night.</t2423> <t2424>This is not my place.</t2424> <t2425>What I'm doing is completely illegal.</t2425>
<t2426>As I pass the fish eye on the wall, I can see the white shape of my covered body, my hair flowing over my shoulders like a mane, and my shining eyes.</t2426> <t2427>I like this.</t2427> <t2428>I'm doing something on my own.</t2428> <t2429>Active; or was it a time?</t2429> <t2430>Stretched time.</t2430> <t2431>The thing I want to steal is a knife from the kitchen, but I'm not ready for it.</t2431>
<t2432>I reach the living room, the door is ajar, I slip inside and leave the door slightly open.</t2432> <t2433>The wood creaks, but who is close enough to hear that?</t2433> <t2434>I stand in the room, letting my pupils dilate, like the eyes of a cat or an owl.</t2434> <t2435>The smell of stale perfume and fabric dust fills my nostrils.</t2435> <t2436>There is a faint hazy light, seeping through the gaps in the closed curtains, from the spotlight outside; undoubtedly two men are patrolling, there, I saw them, from above, behind my curtains, dark shadows, silhouettes.</t2436> <t2437>Now I can see the outlines of some things, their glimmers, from the mirror; the lamp stands, the vases, the faintly discernible couch like a cloud in the twilight.</t2437>
<t2438>What should I take?</t2438> <t2439>Something whose absence won't be noticed.</t2439> <t2440>A magical flower from the forest at night.</t2440> <t2441>Not a withered daffodil from a dried arrangement, though.</t2441> <t2442>The daffodils will be thrown away soon; they've already started to smell.</t2442> <t2443>Along with Serena's stale scents, I can also smell the bad odor of her braid.</t2443>
<t2444>I reach out my hand, find a table, and proceed by feeling my way.</t2444> <t2445>A clatter, I must have bumped into something.</t2445> <t2446>I find the daffodils, they are withered at the tips, weak towards the stems, I use my fingers to hold them.</t2446> <t2447>I will dry this, somewhere.</t2447> <t2448>Under the mattress.</t2448> <t2449>I will leave it there for the next woman, the one who will come after me, to find.</t2449>
<t2450>There is someone in the room, behind me.</t2450> <t2451>I hear footsteps, mine are silent, the same creak of the floor tile.</t2451> <t2452>The door closes behind me with a small click, cutting off the light.</t2452> <t2453>I freeze; it was a white mistake.</t2453> <t2454>Even in the dark, I am my wife in the moonlight.</t2454>
<t2455>Then a whisper: "Don't shout.</t2455> <t2456>Everything is fine.</t2456><t2457>"</t2457>
<t2458>There was no need to shout, everything is fine, you say.</t2458> <t2459>I turn: a shadow, that's all, a dull glimmer of the cheekbone, devoid of color.</t2459>
<t2460>He is stepping towards me.</t2460> <t2461>Nick.</t2461>
<t2462>“What are you doing here?”</t2462><t2463>”</t2463>
<t2464>I am not responding.</t2464> <t2465>It is also illegal for him to be here, he cannot betray me.</t2465> <t2466>Nor can I betray him; for now, we are mirrors of each other.</t2466> <t2467>He puts his hand on my arm, pulls me towards him, his mouth on mine, what else could follow after so much lawlessness?</t2467> <t2468>Without saying a single word, we both tremble, how much I would have wanted it.</t2468> <t2469>In Serena's living room, with dried flowers, on the Chinese carpet, with his slender body.</t2469> <t2470>A completely foreign man.</t2470> <t2471>It would be like screaming, it would be like hitting someone.</t2471> <t2472>My hand slides down, what to say about this, I could have unbuttoned and then.</t2472> <t2473>But this is too dangerous, he knows it, we push each other away, but not too far.</t2473> <t2474>Excessive confidence, excessive danger, we have already gone too far.</t2474>
<t2475>“I was looking for you,” he says, almost breathing inside my ear.</t2475> <t2476>I want to reach up, taste his skin, it makes me hungry.</t2476> <t2477>His fingers move, feeling my arm under the nightgown, as if his hand defies reason.</t2477> <t2478>To be touched by someone, to feel so insatiably, to feel so insatiable, it feels so good.</t2478> <t2479>Luke, you would know, you would understand.</t2479> <t2480>You are the one here, in another body.</t2480>
<t2481>Nonsense.</t2481>
<t2482>“Why?” I say, is his condition so bad that he would risk coming to my room at night?</t2482> <t2483>I think of the hanged men, the men hooked to the Wall.</t2483> <t2484>I can barely stand.</t2484> <t2485>I need to get away, I need to turn to the stairs, before I completely unravel.</t2485> <t2486>His hand is now on my shoulder, motionless, heavy, pressing down like hot lead.</t2486> <t2487>Is this something I would risk my life for?</t2487> <t2488>I am a coward, I hate the thought of pain.</t2488>
<t2489>“He sent me,” says Nick.</t2489> <t2490>“He wants to see you.</t2490> <t2491>In his office.</t2491><t2492>”</t2492>
<t2493>“What do you mean?” I say.</t2493> <t2494>This must be the commander.</t2494> <t2495>Is he going to see me?</t2495> <t2496>What does he mean by seeing?</t2496> <t2497>Is he not satisfied with me?</t2497>
<t2498>“Tomorrow,” he says in a barely audible voice.</t2498> <t2499>In the dark hall, we drift apart, a draft, equally strong hands separating us.</t2499>
<t2500>I find the door, I turn the handle, fingers on the cool porcelain; I open it.</t2500> <t2501>This is all I can do.</t2501>
<t2502>VII</t2502>
<t2503>Night</t2503>
<t2504>18</t2504>
<t2505>I'm lying in bed, still trembling.</t2505> <t2506>When you wet the rim of a glass and run your finger along it, a sound will emerge.</t2506> <t2507>That's exactly how I feel: like that glass sound.</t2507> <t2508>I feel like the word "broken".</t2508> <t2509>I want to be with someone.</t2509>
<t2510>I'm lying in bed, with Luke; his hand is on my swollen belly.</t2510> <t2511>The three of us, in bed, the girl is kicking, turning inside me.</t2511> <t2512>There is thunder outside the window, that's why she's awake, babies can hear, sleep, even get startled, even in the racing of the heart, like the waves surrounding them on the beach.</t2512> <t2513>Lightning strikes, very close, Luke's eyes turn white for a moment.</t2513>
<t2514>I'm not afraid.</t2514> <t2515>We are fully awake, it's pouring rain now, we will be slow and careful.</t2515>
<t2516>If I think I will never experience these again, I will die.</t2516>
<t2517>But this is not true; no one dies from the lack of sex.</t2517> <t2518>We die from the lack of love.</t2518> <t2519>There is no one here that I can love; all the people I could love are either dead or somewhere else.</t2519> <t2520>Who can know where they are or what their names are now?</t2520> <t2521>They might not be anywhere, just as I am not anywhere for them.</t2521> <t2522>I am a lost person too.</t2522>
<t2523>From time to time, I can see their faces, against the darkness, flickering like the images of saints, in the light of candles under a draft in old foreign cathedrals; candles you would light to pray beside, kneeling, your forehead resting on the wooden railing, hoping for an answer.</t2523><t2524>I can call them, but they are just mirages, not permanent.</t2524><t2525>Can I be blamed for wanting a real body to embrace me?</t2525><t2526>Without it, I am also bodiless.</t2526><t2527>I can listen to the beating of my own heart echoing in the bed springs, I can caress myself, under the dry white sheets, in the dark, but I am also dry and white, hard and grainy; it is like running my hand over a plateful of dried rice; like snow.</t2527><t2528>There is something dead in this, something abandoned.</t2528><t2529>I am like a room where something once was and now is completely empty, except for the dust of weed pollen accumulating and flying around on the floor from outside the window.</t2529>
<t2530>Here are the things I believe in.</t2530>
<t2531>I believe Luke is lying face down in some bushes, in a fern thicket, under last year's withered leaves that have just sprouted greens, or maybe it's a fir tree, though it's too early for its fruits.</t2531> <t2532>What remains of him: his hair, bones, a plaid wool shirt, green and black, a leather belt, work boots.</t2532> <t2533>I know exactly what he was wearing.</t2533> <t2534>I can see his clothes in my mind, as clear as a lithograph illustration from a very old magazine or a full-color advertisement, but I can't see his face, not as well.</t2534> <t2535>His face is starting to fade, maybe because it wasn't always the same: His face had different expressions, but his clothes didn't.</t2535>
<t2536>I pray that the hole -or two or three, because more than one shot was fired, they were consecutive- at least one hole, passed cleanly, swiftly, and ultimately through the skull, from the place where all the pictures are, so that this single clash would occur, a single clash of darkness or pain, which I hope was not sharp, like the word "bang," and then silence.</t2536>
<t2537>This is what I believe.</t2537>
<t2538>Also, I believe Luke is sitting somewhere, in a gray cement rectangle, on the edge or protrusion of something, a bed or a chair.</t2538> <t2539>God knows what he's wearing.</t2539> <t2540>God knows what they've put him into.</t2540> <t2541>Not only God knows, so maybe there's a way to find out what happened to him.</t2541> <t2542>He hasn't shaved for a year, though they must be cutting his hair short, saying it's against lice every time they try to cut it.</t2542> <t2543>I need to correct this: If they are cutting his hair against lice, they should also cut his beard.</t2543> <t2544>That's what one would think.</t2544>
<t2545>Anyway, they can't do this well, hair cropped, back of the neck cut, this isn't the worst, looks ten years older, twenty years, hunched like an old man, eyes bagged, small purple veins cracked in his wounds, there's a scar, no, a wound not yet healed, in the color that tulips take at the end of the stem, on the lower left of the face where the flesh was recently torn.</t2545> <t2546>The body is so easily injured, so easily disposed of, it's made up of just water and chemicals, not much different from a jellyfish drying in the sand.</t2546>
<t2547>Moving his hands, moving at all, feels painful to him.</t2547> <t2548>He doesn't know what he's being accused of.</t2548> <t2549>A problem.</t2549> <t2550>There must be something, an accusation.</t2550> <t2551>Otherwise, why are they holding him, why hasn't he died yet?</t2551> <t2552>He must know something they want to know.</t2552> <t2553>I can't think of what it is.</t2553> <t2554>I can't imagine that whatever it is they want, he hasn't said it yet.</t2554> <t2555>I would have told them.</t2555>
<t2556>Surrounded by a scent, with its own scent, the scent of an animal trapped in a dirty cage.</t2556> <t2557>I dream of it while resting, because I can't bear to dream of it at any other time, just like I can't dream of anything between the bottom of its collar and the top of its cuff.</t2557> <t2558>I don't want to think about what they did to its body.</t2558> <t2559>Does it have shoes, I wonder?</t2559> <t2560>No, the ground is cold and wet.</t2560> <t2561>Does it know that I am here, that I am alive, that I am thinking of it?</t2561> <t2562>I must believe that it knows this.</t2562> <t2563>Under limited circumstances, you must believe in all sorts of things.</t2563> <t2564>Now I believe in thought transmission, vibrations in the sky, that kind of nonsense.</t2564> <t2565>I never used to believe in it.</t2565>
<t2566>Also, I believe the following: They didn't catch him or even reach him, he managed to escape, reached the shore, swam in the river, crossed the border, barely made it to a distant shore or island, with his teeth chattering; he reached a nearby farm, was initially taken in with suspicion, but then when they realized who he was, they treated him kindly, they were not the kind of people to betray him, maybe they were Quakers, they would smuggle him inland from house to house; the woman made him some hot coffee and gave him a suit of her husband's clothes.</t2566> <t2567>I picture the clothes in my mind.</t2567> <t2568>Dressing him in something that will keep him warm comforts me.</t2568>
<t2569>He got in touch with the others, there must be a resistance, a government in exile.</t2569> <t2570>There must be someone outside, arranging things.</t2570> <t2571>I believe in the resistance as I believe there can be no light without shadow; or rather, as I believe there can be no shadow without light.</t2571> <t2572>There must be a resistance, otherwise where are all those criminals shown on TV coming from?</t2572>
<t2573>Now, a message from him could come at any moment.</t2573> <t2574>In the most unexpected way, from the most unlikely person, from someone I would never expect.</t2574> <t2575>Maybe under my plate or on the dinner tray?</t2575> <t2576>Or will it be handed to me when I give the report cards over the counter at Bilumum Etler?</t2576>
<t2577>The message will say that I need to be patient: Sooner or later, it will get me out, we will find the girl, wherever they put her.</t2577> <t2578>She will remember us and the three of us will be together.</t2578> <t2579>In the meantime, I must endure, I must take care of myself for later.</t2579> <t2580>What happened to me before, what is happening to me now will not matter to her, she still loves me, she knows it's not my fault.</t2580> <t2581>The message will say this too.</t2581> <t2582>This is the message that keeps me alive, the one that might never come.</t2582> <t2583>I believe in this message.</t2583>
<t2584>Not everything I believe in can be true, yet one of them must be.</t2584> <t2585>Still, I believe in all of them, simultaneously in all three variations regarding Luke's fate.</t2585> <t2586>This way of believing, filled with contradictions, is the only way for me to believe in anything, right now.</t2586> <t2587>Whatever the truth may be, I will be ready for it.</t2587>
<t2588>This is my belief.</t2588> <t2589>This may also not be true.</t2589>
<t2590>On one of the tombstones in the cemetery near the oldest church, there is an anchor and an hourglass, and the following words: In hope.</t2590>
<t2591>In hope.</t2591> <t2592>Why did they write this on a dead person's tombstone?</t2592> <t2593>Was the hopeful one dead, or was it still the living?</t2593>
<t2594>Is Luke hoping as well, I wonder?</t2594>
<t2595>VIII</t2595>
<t2596>Birthday</t2596>
<t2597>19</t2597>
<t2598>I see that I am awake in my dream.</t2598>
<t2599>I see myself getting out of bed and crossing the room, but not this room, from one end to the other, and leaving through the door, but not this door, in my dream.</t2599> <t2600>I am at home, in one of my homes, the girl is running to embrace me, in her small green nightgown with a sunflower on her chest, her feet are bare, I lift her up and feel her arms and legs wrapping around me and I start to cry, because then I realize I am not awake.</t2600> <t2601>I am back in this bed, trying to wake up, I wake up and sit on the edge of the bed, my mother comes in with a tray in her hand and asks if I am feeling better.</t2601> <t2602>When I was a child and sick, she would have to stay home from work.</t2602> <t2603>But this time, I am not awake either.</t2603>
<t2604>After these dreams, I wake up and I know that I am truly awake because I see the garland on the ceiling and my curtains hang like white hair drowned in water.</t2604> <t2605>I feel drugged.</t2605> <t2606>I calculate this possibility: Maybe they are giving me medicine.</t2606> <t2607>Maybe this life I think I am living is nothing but a paranoid delusion.</t2607>
<t2608>There is no hope.</t2608> <t2609>I know where I am, who I am, and what day it is.</t2609> <t2610>Thus, I test myself, my mind is clear.</t2610> <t2611>The mind is a valuable thing to possess; I accumulate it as people once accumulated money.</t2611> <t2612>I keep it, and when the time comes, I will have enough.</t2612>
<t2613>Smoke is seeping through the curtains, a misty light, there's not much sun today.</t2613> <t2614>I get out of bed, go to the window and kneel on the window sill, hard small pillow, FAITH, I look outside There's nothing to see.</t2614>
<t2615>I wonder what happened to the other two pillows?</t2615> <t2616>There should have been three, once upon a time.</t2616> <t2617>Where did they put HOPE and KINDNESS?</t2617> <t2618>Serena Joy has regular habits.</t2618> <t2619>She never throws away something that isn't completely worn out.</t2619> <t2620>Did she give one to Rita and the other to Cora?</t2620>
<t2621>The bell is ringing, I had woken up before the bell, I am ahead of time.</t2621> <t2622>I am getting dressed, without looking ahead.</t2622>
<t2623>I am sitting in the chair and thinking about the word chair4.</t2623> <t2624>It can also mean the head of a meeting.</t2624> <t2625>It can also mean a type of execution method.</t2625> <t2626>It is the first syllable in the word charity5.</t2626> <t2627>In French, it means body.</t2627> <t2628>None of these facts are related to each other.</t2628>
<t2629>These are the types of prayers I use to calm down.</t2629>
<t2630>In front of me, there is a tray, on the tray there is a glass of apple juice, a vitamin pill, a spoon, a plate with three slices of brown toast, a small bowl containing honey, and another plate resembling the skirted body of a woman, with a second egg underneath the skirt to keep it from getting cold.</t2630> <t2631>The egg cup is made of white porcelain with blue stripes.</t2631>
<t2632>The first egg is white.</t2632> <t2633>I push the egg holder a bit, so it enters the weak daylight that comes through the window, illuminating, diminishing, then illuminating again, and falls onto the tray.</t2633> <t2634>The shell of the egg is smooth but also rough; it is marked by small calcium particles resembling craters on the moon.</t2634> <t2635>A barren land, yet perfect; a kind of desert that saints go to so their minds do not succumb to extremes.</t2635> <t2636>I think God must look like this: an egg.</t2636> <t2637>Life on the moon might be inside rather than on the surface.</t2637> <t2638>The egg is now glowing, as if it has its own energy.</t2638> <t2639>Looking at the egg gives me great pleasure.</t2639>
<t2640>The sun is disappearing and the egg is fading.</t2640>
<t2641>I take the egg from the captain and for a moment I turn it around between my fingers.</t2641> <t2642>Warm.</t2642> <t2643>In the past, women used to carry these between their breasts to incubate them.</t2643> <t2644>They must have felt good.</t2644>
<t2645>Minimalist life.</t2645> <t2646>Even an egg gives pleasure.</t2646> <t2647>Blessings that can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</t2647> <t2648>But it is expected of me to give up in this way.</t2648> <t2649>If I have an egg, what more could I want?</t2649>
<t2650>Under limited means, the desire to live attaches itself to strange objects.</t2650> <t2651>I would like to have a pet: a bird or a cat.</t2651> <t2652>A friend.</t2652> <t2653>It could be anything familiar.</t2653> <t2654>A rat would do, if necessary, but such a possibility doesn't exist.</t2654> <t2655>This house is too clean.</t2655>
<t2656>I open the top of the egg with a spoon and eat the inside.</t2656>
<t2657>While eating the second egg, I hear the siren, a thin sound like the buzz of an insect, at first from a distance, winding its way through large houses and mowed lawns towards me; then it gets closer, blooming from the sound like a flower and turning into a trumpet.</t2657> <t2658>This siren is an announcement.</t2658> <t2659>I put down my spoon, my heart rate quickens, I go to the window again: will it be blue, meaning not for me?</t2659> <t2660>I see it turning the corner, advancing along the street, still making noise, stopping in front of the house, and it is red.</t2660> <t2661>Happiness in the world, this is something rarely experienced these days.</t2661> <t2662>I leave the second egg half-eaten, run to the closet to get my cloak, I can already hear my footsteps on the stairs and them calling me.</t2662>
<t2663>“Hurry up,” says Cora.</t2663> <t2664>“They won't wait for you all day.” She helps me put on my cloak and is actually smiling.</t2664>
<t2665>I'm almost running through the hall, sliding down the stairs, the front door is wide open, I can use it today, the Guard is standing there, saluting.</t2665> <t2666>It has started to rain, drizzling, the pregnant scent of soil and grass fills the air.</t2666>
<t2667>The red Birthmobile is parked on the driveway.</t2667> <t2668>The back door is open, I climb inside.</t2668> <t2669>The carpet on the floor is red, and red curtains are drawn on the windows.</t2669> <t2670>Three women are already sitting on the benches placed on both sides of the minibus.</t2670> <t2671>The guard closes and locks the double doors and sits in the front next to the driver; we can see the backs of their heads through the wire mesh covered with glass.</t2671> <t2672>We move with a jolt, a siren wails above us: Make way, make way!</t2672>
<t2673>"Kim?" I ask the woman next to me; towards her ear or where her ear should be under the white hood.</t2673> <t2674>I almost have to shout, the noise is so loud.</t2674>
<t2675>“Warreninki,” he shouts.</t2675> <t2676>As we turn the corner shakily, he grabs my hand involuntarily, squeezes it; he turns to me and I see his face, tears are streaming down his cheeks, but what kind of tears are these?</t2676> <t2677>Jealousy, disappointment?</t2677> <t2678>But no, he is laughing, he suddenly wraps his arms around my neck, I had never seen him before, he hugs me, he has large breasts under his red dress, he wipes his face with the sleeve of his dress.</t2678> <t2679>On a day like this, we can do anything we want.</t2679>
<t2680>I'm correcting: within the limits.</t2680>
<t2681>In front of us, on the other bench, a woman with her eyes closed, hands on her mouth, is praying.</t2681> <t2682>Or she might not be praying.</t2682> <t2683>Maybe she is biting her nails.</t2683> <t2684>She is possibly trying to stay calm.</t2684> <t2685>The third woman has already calmed down.</t2685> <t2686>She is sitting with her arms crossed, smiling slightly.</t2686> <t2687>The siren keeps blaring.</t2687> <t2688>In the past, this was the sound of death for ambulances or fires.</t2688> <t2689>It is possibly the sound of death today as well.</t2689> <t2690>We will learn this soon.</t2690> <t2691>What will Warren's give birth to, I wonder?</t2691> <t2692>A baby, as we all hope?</t2692> <t2693>Or something else, a Non-Baby with a pinhead or a dog nose or two bodies or a hole in the heart or without arms or with webbed hands or feet?</t2693> <t2694>It is not possible to say.</t2694> <t2695>Once they could tell, but now it is illegal.</t2695> <t2696>And even if it were known, what would it change?</t2696> <t2697>You can't abort it; whatever it is, it must be carried to term.</t2697>
<t2698>One in four chance, we learned this at the Center.</t2698> <t2699>Once upon a time, the air was excessively filled with chemicals, rays, radiation, and the water was teeming with toxic molecules; it would take years to clean all this up. Meanwhile, they penetrate your body and settle into your fatty cells.</t2699> <t2700>Who knows, your body could be as dirty as a beach covered in oil, a certain death for shorebirds and unborn babies.</t2700> <t2701>Maybe a vulture would die from eating you.</t2701> <t2702>Maybe you would glow in the dark like an old-fashioned clock.</t2702> <t2703>Death clock6.</t2703> <t2704>This is a type of insect, a carrion beetle.</t2704>
<t2705>Sometimes, without considering the skeleton, I can't think of myself, my body: I wonder how an electron sees me?</t2705> <t2706>A cradle of life made of bone; and inside, dangers, corrupted proteins, glass-like notched defective crystals.</t2706> <t2707>Women took medicines and pills, men sprayed the trees with chemicals, cows ate the grass, and all these additive-filled excrements flowed into the rivers.</t2707> <t2708>During earthquakes, along with the San Andreas fault -actually, it wasn't anyone's fault- there's no need to mention the nuclear power plants that exploded and the mutated syphilis that fit no mold.</t2708> <t2709>Some sterilized themselves, some had their tubes tied or damaged their bodies with chemicals.</t2709> <t2710>How, Aunt Lydia would say, squeezing her hands, oh my God, how could they do these things?</t2710> <t2711>Shameless! Those who scorn God's blessings!</t2711>
<t2712>You are taking a risk, said Aunt Lydia, but you are shock troops, you will go ahead into dangerous areas.</t2712> <t2713>The greater the risk, the greater the victory.</t2713> <t2714>She clasped her hands, cheering up with our feigned courage.</t2714> <t2715>We were looking down at our tables with our heads bowed.</t2715> <t2716>Going through all this and ending up giving birth to something rotten: This was not a pleasant thought.</t2716> <t2717>We didn't know exactly what happened to the babies who didn't pass the test, those designated as Non-Babies.</t2717> <t2718>But we knew they were sent somewhere, quickly, far away.</t2718>
<t2719>There wasn't a single reason, says Aunt Lydia.</t2719> <t2720>She stands at the front of the room, in her khaki dress, holding a pointer stick.</t2720> <t2721>On the blackboard, where there used to be a map, there is now a graph: showing the birth rate per thousand over the years, a sharp decline, below the zero line, down, down, and down.</t2721>
<t2722>Of course, some women believed that there would be no future, that the world would explode and be destroyed.</t2722> <t2723>This was the excuse they put forward, says Aunt Lydia.</t2723> <t2724>There is no point in giving birth, they said.</t2724> <t2725>Aunt Lydia's nostrils narrow: what immorality.</t2725> <t2726>They were lazy women, she says.</t2726> <t2727>They were sluts.</t2727>
<t2728>Initials and dates are carved on the upper part of my desk.</t2728> <t2729>Sometimes these are combined in pairs with the word "loves."</t2729> <t2730>J.</t2730> <t2731>H., B.</t2731> <t2732>loves P.</t2732> <t2733>1954.</t2733> <t2734>O.</t2734> <t2735>R., L.</t2735> <t2736>loves T.</t2736> <t2737>I liken them to the inscriptions I have read about, carved into the stone walls of caves or drawn with a mixture of soot and animal fat.</t2737> <t2738>They seem incredibly old to me.</t2738> <t2739>The upper part of the desk is yellow wood; it slopes downward and has an armrest on the right side that you use when writing on paper with a pen.</t2739> <t2740>You could put things inside the desk: books, notebooks.</t2740> <t2741>These habits of the past now seem wasteful to me, almost decadent: like immoral, barbaric orgies.</t2741> <t2742>M.</t2742><t2743>loves G.</t2743> <t2744>1972.</t2744> <t2745>This carving, made by repeatedly piercing the worn varnish of the desk with a pen, possesses the melancholic essence of all lost civilizations.</t2745> <t2746>Like a handprint on stone.</t2746> <t2747>Whoever did this once lived.</t2747>
<t2748>There is no date after the mid-eighties.</t2748> <t2749>This must be one of the schools that was closed because there were no children.</t2749>
<t2750>She had her faults, says Aunt Lydia.</t2750> <t2751>We do not intend to repeat them.</t2751> <t2752>Her voice is pious and humble, the voice of someone whose duty is to say unpleasant things for our own good.</t2752> <t2753>I would like to strangle her.</t2753> <t2754>As soon as the thought comes to mind, I dismiss it.</t2754>
<t2755>Something, he says, is only valuable if it is scarce and hard to obtain.</t2755> <t2756>We want you to be valuable, girls.</t2756> <t2757>Aunt Lydia is generous in giving pauses that she savors thoroughly.</t2757> <t2758>Think of yourselves as pearls.</t2758> <t2759>We sit in our rows, heads bowed, making our mouths water with moral appetite.</t2759> <t2760>We belong to her to be defined, we must endure her characterizations.</t2760>
<t2761>I am thinking about pearls.</t2761> <t2762>Pearls are clotted oyster saliva.</t2762> <t2763>I will tell this to Moira, later; if I can.</t2763>
<t2764>All of us here will shape you, says Aunt Lydia, with a satisfactory pride.</t2764>
<t2765>The minibus stops, the rear doors open, and the Guardian herds us outside.</t2765> <t2766>Another Guardian, with one of those disdainful machine guns slung over his shoulder, stands at the front door.</t2766> <t2767>We line up towards the front door as it drizzles, the Guardians salute.</t2767> <t2768>The Great Birthing Carriage, where the machines and car doctors are, is parked further ahead in the courtyard.</t2768> <t2769>I see one of the doctors looking out from the minibus window.</t2769> <t2770>Inside, while waiting, I wonder what they are doing.</t2770> <t2771>They are probably playing cards, some kind of masculine pastime.</t2771> <t2772>Most of the time, they are not needed at all; they are only allowed inside if there is nothing else left to do.</t2772>
<t2773>In the past, the situation was different, the responsibility was theirs.</t2773> <t2774>What a great shame it was, Aunt Lydia would say.</t2774> <t2775>It was shameful.</t2775> <t2776>The film she had just shown us was shot in a hospital from the old days: a pregnant woman connected to a machine with wires, with so many electrodes coming out of her that she looked like a broken robot, and an IV attached to her arm.</t2776> <t2777>Between her shaved legs, a man looking with a light, a hairless girl alone, a tray full of shiny sterilized knives, everyone masked.</t2777> <t2778>A common patient.</t2778> <t2779>Once, they used to drug women, increase their labor pains, cut and sew them up.</t2779> <t2780>Such things no longer exist.</t2780> <t2781>There isn't even anesthesia.</t2781> <t2782>Aunt Elizabeth would say it was better for the baby, but also: I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain, you will give birth to children.</t2782> <t2783>They would give us this along with brown bread and salad sandwiches at lunch.</t2783>
<t2784>As I ascend the wide steps, each flanked by a stone vase - the Commander of Warren's must be of a higher status than ours - I hear another siren.</t2784> <t2785>The blue Birthmobile for the Wives.</t2785> <t2786>This must be Serena Joy arriving in splendor.</t2786> <t2787>They have real, upholstered seats instead of benches.</t2787> <t2788>They face forward and the curtains are not drawn.</t2788> <t2789>They know where they are going.</t2789>
<t2790>It is possible that Serena Joy had come here, to this house, before, for tea.</t2790> <t2791>It is possible that Warren's wife, the former whining bitch Janine, was paraded in front of him and the other Wives, so they could see her belly, maybe even touch it, and congratulate his Wife.</t2791> <t2792>A strong girl, good muscles.</t2792> <t2793>No Orange Agent in her family, we checked her records, one can never be too careful.</t2793> <t2794>And perhaps one of the more polite ones: Would you like a biscuit, dear?</t2794>
<t2795>Ooh, yoo, you will make them sick, too much sugar is not good for them.</t2795>
<t2796>Probably nothing will happen from just one, just this once, Mildred.</t2796>
<t2797>And the shameless Janine: Ooh, yes, can I have it, Sir, please?</t2797>
<t2798>Oh, and so polite, not sullen like the others, they just do their jobs, that's all.</t2798> <t2799>More like your daughter, one could say.</t2799> <t2800>Like a member of the family.</t2800> <t2801>Comforting maternal giggles.</t2801> <t2802>That's all, dear, you can go back to your room.</t2802>
<t2803>And after he left: Little whores, all of them, but what can you do, you can't choose.</t2803> <t2804>You take whatever they give you, right, girls!</t2804> <t2805>This one is from the Commander's Wife.</t2805>
<t2806>Oh, but you turned out to be very lucky.</t2806> <t2807>Some of them, dear, aren't even clean.</t2807> <t2808>And they don't even show you a smile, they shut themselves in their rooms, don't wash their hair, oh those smells, don't they?</t2808> <t2809>I have to make the Marthas do it, they almost have to tie her to the tub, you have to outright bribe her, threaten her to take a bath.</t2809>
<t2810>I had to take strict measures for mine, now he doesn't eat dinner properly, and when it comes to the other thing, there's not even a tiny result, even though we do it so regularly.</t2810> <t2811>But yours is your pride and joy.</t2811> <t2812>The birth can happen at any moment now, oh you must be so excited, look how swollen you are, I bet waiting is hard for you.</t2812>
<t2813>A little more tea?</t2813> <t2814>Changing the subject politely.</t2814>
<t2815>I know what is happening there.</t2815>
<t2816>Meanwhile, what might Janine be doing in her room upstairs?</t2816> <t2817>She might be sitting, licking her lips, with the taste of candy still in her mouth.</t2817> <t2818>She might be looking out the window.</t2818> <t2819>She might be breathing in and out.</t2819> <t2820>She might be caressing her swollen breasts.</t2820> <t2821>She might not be thinking about anything.</t2821>
<t2822>20</t2822>
<t2823>The main staircase with its curved railings on both sides is wider than ours.</t2823> <t2824>I can hear the songs of the women upstairs.</t2824> <t2825>In a single file, we ascend the stairs, being careful not to step on each other's trailing skirts.</t2825> <t2826>On the left, the double doors of the dining room are open, I can see the long table inside, covered with a white cloth and an open buffet: ham, cheese, oranges -they have oranges!- and freshly baked breads and pastries.</t2826> <t2827>As for us, we will be given a tray with milk and sandwiches later.</t2827> <t2828>But they have a coffee machine and wine bottles, why shouldn’t the Wives get a little drunk on such a magnificent day?</t2828> <t2829>First, they will wait for the result, then they will feast.</t2829> <t2830>Now they have gathered in the sitting room on the other side to cheer up this Commander’s Wife, Warren’s Wife.</t2830> <t2831>A small, thin woman, in her white cotton nightgown, lies on the floor, her hair, starting to gray, spreading out on the carpet like mold; she is being massaged at the waist, as if she were the one actually giving birth.</t2831>
<t2832>The commander, of course, is nowhere to be seen.</t2832> <t2833>He must have gone to the place where men go in such situations, a kind of escape place.</t2833> <t2834>If everything goes well, he is probably calculating when his promotion will likely be announced.</t2834> <t2835>He will definitely get a promotion now.</t2835>
<t2836>Warren's wife is in the master bedroom, a good name for the room; the place where the Commander and his Wife sleep at night.</t2836> <t2837>She is sitting on that massive bed, propped up with pillows: Janine, swollen but diminished, her former name clipped and discarded.</t2837> <t2838>She is wearing a white cotton garment gathered around her hips, her long marigold-colored hair brushed back and tied in a bun to keep it out of the way.</t2838> <t2839>Her eyes are tightly closed, in this state I could almost love her.</t2839> <t2840>After all, she is one of us; what has she ever wanted other than to live her life as best as she can?</t2840> <t2841>What else would any of us want?</t2841> <t2842>What we seek to grasp is the possible.</t2842> <t2843>She is managing well under these circumstances, indeed.</t2843>
<t2844>Two women I don't know are standing on either side of Janine, holding her hand, or Janine is holding theirs.</t2844> <t2845>A third one is lifting her nightgown, pouring baby oil on the mound of her belly, and rubbing it downward.</t2845> <t2846>Aunt Elizabeth is standing at the foot of the bed, in her military khaki outfit with breast pockets; she was the one who taught the Gyn Ed7 class.</t2846> <t2847>All I can see is the side of her head, her profile, but I know it's her; that prominent nose and smooth, firm chin.</t2847> <t2848>Next to her are two Birthing Chairs with two seats, the rear seat elevated like a throne.</t2848> <t2849>They won't seat Janine there until it's time.</t2849>
<t2850>The sheets, the small tub for the bath, the bowl with the ice Janine will suck on are ready.</t2850>
<t2851>The other women are sitting cross-legged on the carpet; there are many women, everyone in this area must be here.</t2851> <t2852>There must be twenty-five, thirty people.</t2852> <t2853>Not every Commander has a Handmaid.</t2853> <t2854>Some of the Wives have children.</t2854> <t2855>From each according to her ability, to each according to his need, says the slogan.</t2855> <t2856>We used to recite this three times after dessert, it was from the Bible or so they said.</t2856> <t2857>Saint Paul again.</t2857>
<t2858>You are the transitional generation, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t2858> <t2859>You are the ones in the most difficult situation.</t2859> <t2860>We are aware of the sacrifices expected from you.</t2860> <t2861>It is hard to endure the humiliation from men.</t2861> <t2862>It will be easier for those who come after you.</t2862> <t2863>They will accept their duties willingly.</t2863>
<t2864>What he didn't say was this: Because there will be no other memories.</t2864>
<t2865>What he said is this: Because they will not want things they cannot have.</t2865>
<t2866>Once a week, after lunch and before naptime, we would watch a movie.</t2866> <t2867>We would sit on our small gray mats on the floor in the Home Care room and wait while Aunt Helena and Aunt Lydia struggled with the projection equipment.</t2867> <t2868>If we were lucky, they would set up the film without reversing it.</t2868> <t2869>It reminded me of geography classes at my own high school thousands of years ago, where they showed films about the rest of the world; women in long skirts or cheap printed cotton dresses, carrying bundles of sticks, baskets, plastic buckets filled with water from this or that river, with babies slung on their backs in shawls or net carriers, looking at us from the screen as if they were cross-eyed or scared, sensing that something was being done to them with a single glass-eyed machine but not quite understanding what it was.</t2869> <t2870>These films were comforting but a little boring.</t2870> <t2871>They made me sleepy, even when muscular men appeared on the screen, carrying rocks and digging hard soil with primitive hoes and shovels.</t2871> <t2872>I preferred films that included dance, songs, ceremonial masks, and artworks carved to make music: feathers, brass buttons, spiral mother-of-pearl shells, drums.</t2872> <t2873>I enjoyed watching these people when they were happy, not when they were miserable, starving, skin and bones, struggling to death for simple things like digging a well or irrigating the land, problems that civilized people had solved long ago.</t2873> <t2874>I used to think someone should give them the technology and let them implement it.</t2874>
<t2875>Aunt Lydia would not show these kinds of films.</t2875>
<t2876>Sometimes the film shown would be an old pornographic movie from the seventies or eighties.</t2876> <t2877>Women kneeling, sucking on a penis or a gun, women tied up or with dog collars around their necks, women hanging from trees or upside down, naked, with their legs spread apart, women being raped, beaten, killed.</t2877> <t2878>Once, we had to watch a woman being slowly dismembered, her fingers and breasts being cut off with garden shears, her stomach being slit open and her intestines pulled out.</t2878>
<t2879>Consider the options, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t2879> <t2880>Do you see how things used to be?</t2880> <t2881>This is what they thought about women back then.</t2881> <t2882>Her voice was trembling with anger.</t2882>
<t2883>Moira later said that this wasn't real, that these were done with models; but it was hard to understand.</t2883>
<t2884>However, sometimes the film would become what Aunt Lydia called the Unwoman documentary.</t2884> <t2885>Imagine, Aunt Lydia would say, they are wasting their time in this way when they should be doing something useful.</t2885> <t2886>At that time, the Unwomen always wasted their time.</t2886> <t2887>They were encouraged to do so.</t2887> <t2888>The government would pay them to behave this way.</t2888> <t2889>Look, some of their ideas were quite solid, Aunt Lydia would continue, with the smug authority of someone in a position to judge in her voice.</t2889> <t2890>We had to overlook some of their ideas, even today.</t2890> <t2891>But only some ideas, she would say coquettishly, raising her index finger and wagging it at us.</t2891> <t2892>However, they were godless and that might make all the difference, don't you think?</t2892>
<t2893>I am sitting on my mat with my hands clasped, Aunt Lydia moves away from the screen and steps aside, the lights go out, I wonder if I can reach out to the right without being seen in the dark and whisper to the woman in my memory.</t2893> <t2894>What will I whisper? Have you seen Moira? I will say.</t2894> <t2895>Because no one has seen her, she wasn't at breakfast.</t2895> <t2896>However, the room, despite being dim, is not very dark, I direct my mind to the waiting period given for gathering attention.</t2896> <t2897>They play these kinds of films silently, but the pornographic ones with sound.</t2897> <t2898>They want us to hear the screams, grunts, and cries of what is assumed to be either extreme pain or extreme pleasure or a mixture of both, but not what the Unwomen are saying.</t2898>
<t2899>First, the title of the movie and a few names appear, but they are covered with a strip so we can't read them, and then I see my mother.</t2899> <t2900>My young mother, younger than I remember her, as young as she must have been before I was born.</t2900> <t2901>In those days, she was wearing the typical clothes of the Unwomen that Aunt Lydia described, a denim overall, a green and lilac plaid shirt underneath, and sneakers on her feet; things that Moira used to wear, things I remember wearing myself a very long time ago.</t2901> <t2902>Her hair is tucked into a lilac-colored scarf tied at the back of her head.</t2902> <t2903>Her face is very young, very serious, even beautiful.</t2903> <t2904>I had forgotten that my mother was once this beautiful and serious.</t2904> <t2905>She is among a group of other women dressed in the same style; she is holding a stick, no, a part of a flag, the handle.</t2905> <t2906>The camera pans up and we see the writing painted on something that was probably once a sheet: TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.</t2906> <t2907>This writing is not blacked out, even though we are not supposed to read it.</t2907> <t2908>The women around me are sighing, there is a stir in the room, like the wind moving over the grass.</t2908> <t2909>Was this an unintentional mistake, or had she subtly achieved something?</t2909> <t2910>Or is this something they want us to see, to remind us of those old days when there was no security?</t2910>
<t2911>Behind this slogan, there are other slogans, the camera briefly focuses on them: FREEDOM OF CHOICE.</t2911> <t2912>EVERY BABY SHOULD BE A WANTED BABY.</t2912> <t2913>GIVE US BACK OUR BODIES.</t2913> <t2914>DO YOU BELIEVE A WOMAN'S PLACE IS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE?</t2914> <t2915>Under the last slogan, a woman is sketched lying on a table, covered in blood.</t2915>
<t2916>Now my mother is walking forward, smiling, laughing, they all come forward, now they are raising their fists in the air.</t2916> <t2917>The camera, dragging its cables, turns to the sky where hundreds of balloons are rising: Red balloons, with a circle painted on them, a stem resembling an apple stem in the circle, and the stem is a cross.</t2917> <t2918>We return to the ground, my mother is now part of the crowd and I can no longer see her.</t2918>
<t2919>When I was thirty-seven years old, I gave birth to you, my mother used to say.</t2919> <t2920>It was risky, you could have been disabled or something else.</t2920> <t2921>You were a wanted child, yes, that's true, and some circles loaded disasters onto me!</t2921> <t2922>My oldest friend Tricia Foreman accused me of being a protanalist, that bitch.</t2922> <t2923>I attributed this to her jealousy.</t2923> <t2924>Some others were still good.</t2924> <t2925>But in the sixth month of my pregnancy, many started sending articles about how the rate of disabled births increases after thirty-five.</t2925> <t2926>Just what I needed, really.</t2926> <t2927>And a lot of nonsense about how hard it is to be a single parent.</t2927> <t2928>Fuck this shit, I told them, I started this and I will finish it.</t2928> <t2929>They wrote "Advanced Maternal Age Primipara" on my card at the hospital, I caught them doing it.</t2929> <t2930>Over thirty, for god's sake, over thirty, that's the name they give you when you have your first baby.</t2930> <t2931>It's nonsense, I told them, biologically I'm twenty-two, I can run circles around you every day.</t2931> <t2932>While you're still trying to get out of bed, I could give birth to triplets and walk out of here.</t2932>
<t2933>When she said this, she would push her chin forward.</t2933><t2934>I remember her this way, chin thrust forward, at the kitchen table, with a drink in front of her; not young and serious and beautiful like in the movie, but thin, angry, like one of those old women in the supermarket line who wouldn't let anyone cut in front of them.</t2934><t2935>She liked to come to my house, have a drink while Luke and I prepared dinner, and talk about what was wrong in her life - which always turned into what was wrong in our lives.</t2935><t2936>Her hair was gray at that time, of course.</t2936><t2937>She didn't dye it.</t2937><t2938>Why should I look different than I am? she would say.</t2938><t2939>Anyway, why would I need to, I don't want men around, what good are they other than making half a baby in ten seconds?</t2939><t2940>A man is just a tool a woman uses to produce more women.</t2940><t2941>I'm not saying your father wasn't a nice guy, but he wasn't suitable for fatherhood.</t2941><t2942>I wasn't expecting that from him anyway.</t2942><t2943>Just do your job, then you can leave, I said, I have a good salary, I can hire a nanny.</t2943><t2944>So he went to the Pacific coast and sent Christmas cards.</t2944><t2945>Still, he had very beautiful blue eyes.</t2945><t2946>But there was something missing in them, even in the nice ones.</t2946><t2947>They seemed constantly distracted, as if they couldn't quite remember who they were.</t2947><t2948>They look at the sky too much.</t2948><t2949>Their feet don't touch the ground.</t2949><t2950>They can't stick to a woman, and despite being better at fixing cars and playing football, they can't even be half as good as women; this is exactly what we need for the advancement of the human race, isn't it?</t2950>
<t2951>She would talk like this, even in front of Luke.</t2951> <t2952>Luke didn't mind, he admired her by acting like a macho, saying that women lacked the ability to think abstractly, and my mother would get another drink and grin at him.</t2952>
<t2953>Chauvinist pig, my mother used to say.</t2953>
<t2954>"Isn't it antique?" Luke would say to me, and my mother would look cunning, almost sly.</t2954>
<t2955>I have the right to this, he would say.</t2955> <t2956>I've aged enough, I've paid my dues, it's time for me to become an antique.</t2956> <t2957>Your mouth still smells like milk.</t2957> <t2958>I should have said piglet.</t2958>
<t2959>And as for you, he would say to me, you are just a bundle of reactions.</t2959> <t2960>Empty noise.</t2960> <t2961>History will prove me right.</t2961>
<t2962>But she wouldn't say such things until she had downed her third drink.</t2962>
<t2963>You young people don't appreciate the value of anything, my mother used to say.</t2963> <t2964>You have no idea what we went through just to get you to where you are.</t2964> <t2965>Look at this, chopping carrots.</t2965> <t2966>Do you know how many tanks crushed how many women's lives and bodies just to make this little progress?</t2966>
<t2967>Cooking is my hobby, Luke would say.</t2967> <t2968>I enjoy it.</t2968>
<t2969>Hobby schmobbi, my mother would say.</t2969> <t2970>You don't have to make excuses to me.</t2970> <t2971>There was a time when you wouldn't be allowed to have such a hobby, they would call you henpecked.</t2971>
<t2972>Look, mom, I would say.</t2972> <t2973>Let's not argue over nothing.</t2973>
<t2974>Never, he said with pain.</t2974> <t2975>Do you call this nothing?</t2975> <t2976>You don't understand, do you?</t2976> <t2977>You never understand what I'm talking about.</t2977>
<t2978>Sometimes he would cry.</t2978> <t2979>I was so lonely, he would say.</t2979> <t2980>You can't imagine how lonely I was.</t2980> <t2981>I had friends, I was lucky, but I was still lonely.</t2981>
<t2982>I admired my mother in some ways, even though our relationship was not easy at all.</t2982> <t2983>I felt that she expected a lot from me.</t2983> <t2984>She expected me to justify her life and the choices she made.</t2984> <t2985>I didn't want to live my life according to her terms.</t2985> <t2986>I didn't want to be the embodiment of her ideal child.</t2986> <t2987>We always fought about this.</t2987> <t2988>I am not the reason for your existence, I told her once.</t2988>
<t2989>I want it back.</t2989> <t2990>I want everything back, like it used to be.</t2990> <t2991>But this, this desire, has no meaning.</t2991>
<t2992>21</t2992>
<t2993>It's hot and very noisy here.</t2993> <t2994>The voices of women are rising around me, and even a softly sung song is very loud for me after so many days of silence.</t2994> <t2995>In the corner of the room, there is a blood-stained sheet from a burst water bag, folded and thrown there.</t2995> <t2996>I hadn't noticed it before.</t2996>
<t2997>There is also a smell in the room, it has become stuffy, the window should be opened.</t2997> <t2998>The smell comes from our own bodies, an organic scent with a metallic tinge due to sweat and blood on the sheets; there is another smell, presumably from Janine, more animalistic: the smell of caves, of dens once inhabited by humans, the smell of the plaid blanket on the bed where the cat once gave birth before being spayed.</t2998> <t2999>The smell of the womb.</t2999>
<t3000>“Breathe in, breathe in,” we sing, as we were taught.</t3000> <t3001>“Hold, hold.</t3001> <t3002>Release, release, release.”</t3002> <t3003>We sing while counting to five.</t3003> <t3004>Breathe in for five, hold for five, release for five.</t3004> <t3005>Janine, with her eyes closed, tries to slow her breathing, and Aunt Elizabeth tries to feel the birth contractions.</t3005>
<t3006>Now Janine is hesitant, she wants to walk.</t3006> <t3007>Two women help her get out of bed, supporting her as she walks.</t3007> <t3008>A sudden spasm and Janine doubles over.</t3008> <t3009>One of the women kneels down and rubs her back.</t3009> <t3010>We are all good at this, we had our training.</t3010> <t3011>I notice that Gleninki, my shopping partner, is sitting two people away from me.</t3011> <t3012>The softly sung song envelops us like a veil.</t3012>
<t3013>Martha comes in with a tray: powdered fruit juice that looks like grape juice and a stack of paper cups.</t3013> <t3014>She places the tray on the carpet in front of the women who are singing.</t3014> <t3015>Without missing a word, Gleninki empties the pitcher and passes the paper cups along the row.</t3015>
<t3016>She takes a glass, I lean to the side to hand it over, and the woman next to me quietly asks in my ear, "Are you looking for someone?"</t3016>
<t3017>“Moira,” I say, as quietly as she does, “Dark-haired.</t3017> <t3018>Freckled.</t3018><t3019>”</t3019>
<t3020>“No,” says the woman.</t3020> <t3021>I don't know this woman, she wasn't with me at the Center, but I had seen her while shopping.</t3021> <t3022>“But I'll keep an eye out for you.</t3022><t3023>”</t3023>
<t3024>"Your name?" I ask.</t3024>
<t3025>“Alma,” he says.</t3025> <t3026>“What is your real name?</t3026><t3027>”</t3027>
<t3028>I want to tell her that there is an Alma with me at the Center.</t3028> <t3029>I want to say my name, but Aunt Elizabeth lifts her head and scans the room, she must have heard a pause in the song, so there's no time for that anymore.</t3029> <t3030>You can learn something on Birthdays sometimes.</t3030> <t3031>There's no point in asking about Luke.</t3031> <t3032>After all, none of these women have been in a place where they could see him.</t3032>
<t3033>The song continues, and it is starting to affect me too.</t3033> <t3034>This is heavy work, you need to concentrate.</t3034> <t3035>Identify yourself with your body, Aunt Elizabeth used to say.</t3035> <t3036>I can already feel slight cramps in my stomach and my breasts have become heavier.</t3036> <t3037>Janine is screaming, a light scream, something between a scream and a grunt.</t3037>
<t3038>“She is starting to lose herself,” says Aunt Elizabeth.</t3038>
<t3039>One of the assistants is wiping Janine's forehead with a damp cloth.</t3039> <t3040>Janine is now sweating, her hair slipping out of the rubber band in strands, with a few strands sticking to her forehead and neck.</t3040> <t3041>Her skin is moist, slippery, and shiny.</t3041>
<t3042>“Breathe! Breathe! Breathe!” we are singing.</t3042>
<t3043>“I want to go outside,” says Janine.</t3043> <t3044>“I want to take a walk.</t3044> <t3045>I feel good.</t3045> <t3046>I want to go to the bathroom.</t3046><t3047>”</t3047>
<t3048>We all know that she is out of it, she doesn't know what she's doing.</t3048> <t3049>Which of these statements is correct?</t3049> <t3050>Probably the last one.</t3050> <t3051>Aunt Elizabeth signals, two women are standing next to the portable toilet, and Janine is slowly being placed on it.</t3051> <t3052>Another smell is added to the others in the room.</t3052> <t3053>Janine moans again, her head bowed, all we can see is her hair.</t3053> <t3054>In this squatting position, she looks like a doll, an old doll stripped and thrown into a corner with its hands on its lap.</t3054>
<t3055>Janine stands up and walks again.</t3055> <t3056>“I want to sit down,” she says.</t3056> <t3057>How long have we been here?</t3057> <t3058>For minutes or hours.</t3058> <t3059>Now I am sweating, my dress is wet under my arms, there is a taste of salt on my upper lip, false pains are gripping me, the others feel the same, I can tell from their swaying.</t3059> <t3060>Janine is sucking on a piece of ice.</t3060> <t3061>Then, after this, from a centimeter or kilometers away, she screams, “No.”</t3061> <t3062>“Oh no, oh no, oh no.”</t3062> <t3063>This is her second baby; she once had another child, I know this from the Center, she used to cry for it at night, like all of us, only louder.</t3063> <t3064>So she must remember this event, what it was like, what awaited her.</t3064> <t3065>But once it's over, who can remember the pain?</t3065> <t3066>All that remains is a shadow, not even in the mind, just in the body.</t3066> <t3067>Pain leaves a mark on a person, but too deep to be seen.</t3067> <t3068>Out of sight, out of mind.</t3068>
<t3069>Someone has added alcohol to the grape juice.</t3069> <t3070>Someone has swiped a bottle from downstairs.</t3070> <t3071>This won't be the first time at such a gathering; but they will ignore it.</t3071> <t3072>We also need unregulated and wild parties.</t3072>
<t3073>“Dim the lights,” says Aunt Elizabeth.</t3073> <t3074>“Tell her that the time has come.</t3074><t3075>”</t3075>
<t3076>Someone stands up and moves towards the wall, the light in the room turns to twilight, our voices turn into a chorus of creaks and muffled whispers like crickets in a night field.</t3076> <t3077>Two people leave the room, the other two take Janine to the Birthing Chair and place her on the lower of the two seats.</t3077> <t3078>Now Janine is calmer, drawing air into her lungs in a steady manner, we lean forward, tense, our back and abdominal muscles aching from the strain.</t3078> <t3079>It's coming, it's coming, like a trumpet, a call to arms, like a falling wall, descending, we can feel it like a heavy stone being pushed down inside us, we think we are going to explode.</t3079> <t3080>We grasp each other's hands, we are no longer alone.</t3080>
<t3081>The Commander's Wife rushes in, wearing a ridiculous white cotton nightgown with golden stork legs sticking out from underneath.</t3081> <t3082>Two of the Wives in blue dresses and veils hold her by the arms, as if she needed it; her face bears a small tense smile, like a hostess at a party she would prefer not to give.</t3082> <t3083>She must know what we think of her.</t3083> <t3084>She climbs onto the birthing stool and settles on the seat behind and above Janine, so that Janine is enveloped by her: her skinny legs dangle down on either side like the arms of a bizarre chair.</t3084> <t3085>Strangely, she is also wearing white cotton socks and blue bedroom slippers made of the fluffy material used for toilet seat covers.</t3085> <t3086>But we are not paying attention to the Woman, we hardly even see her, our eyes are on Janine.</t3086> <t3087>In the dim light, she glows like the moon among the clouds in her white garment.</t3087>
<t3088>Now she is groaning because of the effort she is exerting.</t3088> <t3089>“Push, push, push,” we whisper.</t3089> <t3090>“Relax.</t3090> <t3091>Breathe.</t3091> <t3092>Push, push, push.”</t3092> <t3093>We are with her, we are the same as her, we are intoxicated.</t3093> <t3094>Aunt Elizabeth is kneeling, with a towel stretched out to catch the baby; here is the crowning and the triumph, a yogurt-covered purple head; another push and the head slides out, towards our expectation, bright and slippery with fluid and blood.</t3094> <t3095>Thank God.</t3095>
<t3096>We hold our breath as Aunt Elizabeth examines her: A girl; poor thing, but for now, she's very good, at least there's no visible disability, hands, feet, eyes, we silently count, everything is in place.</t3096> <t3097>Aunt Elizabeth, holding the baby, looks up at us and smiles.</t3097> <t3098>We smile too, a single smile, tears stream down our cheeks, we are so happy.</t3098>
<t3099>Our happiness partly stems from memories.</t3099> <t3100>The Luke I remember is standing with me in the hospital, holding my hand, dressed in the green outfit and white mask they gave him.</t3100> <t3101>Oh, he said, Oh, my God, he was breathing in astonishment.</t3101> <t3102>He said he couldn't sleep at all that night, he was so excited.</t3102>
<t3103>Aunt Elizabeth is gently washing the baby, the baby didn't cry much, and now is quiet.</t3103> <t3104>To avoid startling the baby, we quietly stand up and gather around Janine, stroking her and lightly tapping her arm.</t3104> <t3105>She is crying too.</t3105> <t3106>Two Blue Wives help the third Wife, the Wife of the house, down from the Birth Chair and take her to the bed, laying her down and covering her.</t3106> <t3107>The now washed and quiet baby is ceremoniously placed in her arms.</t3107> <t3108>The Wives from downstairs now crowd in, pushing us aside.</t3108> <t3109>They are talking very loudly, some still carrying their plates, coffee cups, wine glasses, some with their mouths still full, chirping and congratulating as they gather around the bed, the mother, and the baby.</t3109> <t3110>Jealousy emanates from them, I can smell it, faint acid particles mixed with their perfumes.</t3110> <t3111>The Commander's Wife looks at the baby as if it were a bouquet of flowers: something she has won, a source of pride.</t3111>
<t3112>The Spouses are here to witness the naming ceremony.</t3112> <t3113>The Spouses perform the naming ceremony here.</t3113>
<t3114>“Angela,” says the Commander's Wife.</t3114>
<t3115>“Angela, Angela,” the Wives chirped, repeating.</t3115> <t3116>“What a sweet name!</t3116> <t3117>Oh, perfect! Oh, wonderful!</t3117><t3118>”</t3118>
<t3119>We stand between Janine and the bed, so she doesn't have to see it.</t3119> <t3120>Someone gives her a glass of grape juice, I hope it has wine in it, she is still in pain, for the placenta to come, crying desperately; burnt, miserable tears.</t3120> <t3121>Still, we are very happy, this is a victory, for all of us.</t3121> <t3122>We did this job.</t3122>
<t3123>They will allow her to feed the baby for a few months because they believe in the benefits of breast milk.</t3123> <t3124>Then she will be sent somewhere else to see if she can repeat this with someone in need.</t3124> <t3125>But she will never be sent to the Colonies, never be declared an Unwoman.</t3125> <t3126>That is her reward.</t3126>
<t3127>The birth carriage is waiting outside to take us to our own homes.</t3127> <t3128>The doctors are still inside their minibus; their faces appear in the window, white spots, like the faces of sick children confined at home.</t3128> <t3129>One of them opens the door and comes towards us.</t3129>
<t3130>"Did it go well during the birth?" he asks anxiously.</t3130>
<t3131>“Yes,” I say.</t3131> <t3132>I am now in a state of boredom and exhaustion.</t3132> <t3133>My breasts are aching, slightly leaking milk.</t3133> <t3134>False milk, some of us are affected this way.</t3134> <t3135>As we are taken away, we sit on our benches looking at each other; we are now emotionless, almost numb, we could be a bundle of red cloth.</t3135> <t3136>We are in pain.</t3136> <t3137>Each of us holds an imaginary, ghostly baby in her lap.</t3137> <t3138>What we face now, after the excitement has passed, is our own failure.</t3138> <t3139>Mother, I think.</t3139> <t3140>Wherever you are.</t3140> <t3141>Can you hear me?</t3141> <t3142>You wanted a civilization of women.</t3142> <t3143>Yes, now there is one.</t3143> <t3144>This is not what you meant, but here it is nonetheless.</t3144> <t3145>Be thankful for small mercies.</t3145>
<t3146>22</t3146>
<t3147>When the birth carriage arrived in front of the house, it was already afternoon.</t3147> <t3148>The sun was passing wearily through the clouds, and the scent of the warming, damp grass hung in the air.</t3148> <t3149>So, I spent the whole day in Doğum; one loses the sense of time.</t3149> <t3150>Cora will do the shopping; today I am relieved of all duties.</t3150> <t3151>I am climbing the stairs, shifting my weight from one foot to the other weakly and holding onto the banister.</t3151> <t3152>I feel as if I have been awake for days and running endlessly, my chest hurts; my muscles are cramping as if deprived of sugar.</t3152> <t3153>This time, I accept the silence with contentment.</t3153>
<t3154>I am in bed.</t3154> <t3155>I would like to rest, to sleep, but I am very tired, and at the same time very excited; my eyes will not close.</t3155> <t3156>I am looking at the ceiling, watching the leaves of the wreath.</t3156> <t3157>Today it reminds me of a hat, the wide-brimmed hats that women used to wear in a period of the old days: hats that resembled gigantic halos, adorned with fruits and flowers and the feathers of exotic birds; hats that suggested the idea of a paradise floating just above the head, like a thought embodied in flesh and bone.</t3157>
<t3158>Soon the wreath will start to color, and I will begin to see things.</t3158> <t3159>That's how tired I am: Like when you drive all night long, keeping each other awake with stories and taking turns at the wheel, for some reason - I can't come up with a reason now - until dawn; as the sun begins to rise, you start to see things at the corners of your eyes: purple animals in the bushes by the road, vague shadows of people that disappear when you look directly at them.</t3159>
<t3160>I am too tired to continue this story.</t3160> <t3161>I am too tired to think about where I am.</t3161> <t3162>Here is a different, better story for you.</t3162> <t3163>This is the story of what happened to Moira.</t3163>
<t3164>I can complete part of it myself, I heard part of it from Alma, Alma from Dolores, Dolores from Janine, and Janine from Aunt Lydia.</t3164> <t3165>Even in places like these and under such conditions, there can be closeness.</t3165> <t3166>This is something you can rely on: There will always be closeness, of one kind or another.</t3166>
<t3167>Aunt Lydia called Janine to her office.</t3167>
<t3168>God bless the fruit, Janine, Aunt Lydia said without lifting her head from the desk where she was writing something.</t3168> <t3169>Every rule always has an exception: this can also be trusted.</t3169> <t3170>Aunts are allowed to read and write.</t3170>
<t3171>"May God accept it," Janine replied, with her toneless, transparent voice, her raw egg white voice.</t3171>
<t3172>I feel that I can trust you, Janine, said Aunt Lydia finally, lifting her eyes from the pages and pinning Janine in place with a look that managed to be both threatening and pleading at the same time from behind her glasses.</t3172> <t3173>Help me, this look was saying, we're all in this together.</t3173> <t3174>You're a trustworthy girl, she continued, you're not like some of the others.</t3174>
<t3175>He thought that all of Janine's tearful crying and regrets had a meaning, that she had been resolved and had become a true believer.</t3175> <t3176>But at that time, Janine had turned into a little puppy that had been randomly kicked by many people whenever they came across her: she would do somersaults in front of everyone just for a moment of appreciation, and she would say anything.</t3176>
<t3177>That's why Janine said: I hope so, Aunt Lydia.</t3177> <t3178>I hope I have been worthy of your trust.</t3178> <t3179>Or something like that.</t3179>
<t3180>Janine, Aunt Lydia said, something very terrible has happened.</t3180>
<t3181>Janine looked around.</t3181> <t3182>No matter what, she knew she wouldn't be blamed for this; she was innocent.</t3182> <t3183>But what good had it done in the past, being innocent?</t3183> <t3184>Thus, she felt both guilty and as if she were about to be punished at the same time.</t3184>
<t3185>Do you know what this is, Janine? Aunt Lydia said in a soft voice.</t3185>
<t3186>No, Aunt Lydia, said Janine.</t3186> <t3187>At that moment, she realized she should lift her head and look directly into Aunt Lydia's eyes.</t3187> <t3188>A moment later, she managed to do so.</t3188>
<t3189>Because if you know, you will have disappointed me, said Aunt Lydia.</t3189>
<t3190>God be my witness, said Janine with a fiery demeanor.</t3190>
<t3191>Aunt Lydia gave one of her familiar speeches.</t3191> <t3192>She was playing with her pen.</t3192> <t3193>Moira is no longer with us, she said finally.</t3193>
<t3194>"Oh," said Janine.</t3194> <t3195>It didn't really concern her.</t3195> <t3196>Moira wasn't her friend.</t3196> <t3197>"Is she dead?" she asked after a while.</t3197>
<t3198>Then Aunt Lydia told her this story.</t3198> <t3199>During the exercise class, Moira raised her hand to go to the bathroom.</t3199> <t3200>She went.</t3200> <t3201>The bathroom duty was Aunt Elizabeth's.</t3201> <t3202>Aunt Elizabeth, as usual, was standing outside the bathroom door; Moira went in.</t3202> <t3203>After a while, Moira called out to Aunt Elizabeth: the toilet was overflowing, could Aunt Elizabeth come and fix it?</t3203> <t3204>It was true that the toilets sometimes overflowed.</t3204> <t3205>Unknown persons were stuffing rolls and rolls of toilet paper into the toilets.</t3205> <t3206>The Aunts were working on a perfect solution to prevent this, but funds were scarce and they had to make do with what they had, and they hadn't found a way to lock up the toilet paper.</t3206> <t3207>Maybe they should keep it on a table outside the door and give each girl one or a few sheets as they went in.</t3207> <t3208>But this was something for the future.</t3208> <t3209>It takes time to iron out the kinks of new things.</t3209>
<t3210>Aunt Elizabeth entered the bathroom without suspecting any harm.</t3210> <t3211>Aunt Lydia honestly admitted that this was a bit foolish.</t3211> <t3212>On the other hand, she had entered many times before to fix toilet issues without any mishaps.</t3212>
<t3213>Moira wasn't lying, the place was flooded and broken feces were floating around.</t3213> <t3214>It wasn't very pleasant and Aunt Elizabeth was annoyed.</t3214> <t3215>Moira was standing politely to the side and Aunt Elizabeth hurried into the stall Moira had shown her, bending over the back of the toilet.</t3215> <t3216>Her aim was to lift the porcelain lid and fiddle with the plastic ball and stopper mechanism inside.</t3216> <t3217>Both her hands were on the lid when she felt something hard, sharp, and possibly metallic being pressed into her ribs from behind.</t3217> <t3218>Don't move, said Moira, or I'll shove it all the way in, I know where, I'll pierce your lungs.</t3218>
<t3219>Later, they realized that she had taken apart the inside of one of the toilet flushes and removed the long, thin crowbar, the part connected to the handle on one end and to the chain on the other.</t3219> <t3220>Once you knew how to do it, it wasn't a very difficult task, and Moira had a knack for mechanics; she would repair small things on her own car.</t3220> <t3221>Some time after that, chains were attached to the toilet lids to prevent them from being opened, and it took a long time to open them when they overflowed.</t3221> <t3222>We had several such flood disasters.</t3222>
<t3223>Aunt Elizabeth couldn't see what was being stuck into her back, said Aunt Lydia.</t3223> <t3224>She was a brave woman...</t3224>
<t3225>Oh, yes, said Janine.</t3225>
<t3226>...</t3226> <t3227>"But she wasn't crazy," said Aunt Lydia, frowning slightly.</t3227> <t3228>Janine had spoken too passionately, which sometimes amounts to denial.</t3228> <t3229>"She did what Moira told her," Aunt Lydia continued.</t3229> <t3230>Moira grabbed Aunt Elizabeth's prod and whistle, ordering her to take off her belt.</t3230> <t3231>Then she hurriedly dragged Aunt Elizabeth down the stairs to the basement.</t3231> <t3232>They were on the second floor, not the third, so there were only two flights of stairs to account for.</t3232> <t3233>Since classes were in session, there was no one in the hallways.</t3233> <t3234>They did see one Aunt, but she was at the other end of the corridor and wasn't looking their way.</t3234> <t3235>Aunt Elizabeth could have screamed here, but she knew Moira would do what she said; Moira had a bad reputation.</t3235>
<t3236>Oh, yes, said Janine.</t3236>
<t3237>Moira led Aunt Elizabeth through the empty cupboard corridor and past the gym door to the boiler room.</t3237> <t3238>She told Aunt Elizabeth to take off all her clothes...</t3238>
<t3239>Oh, said Janine weakly, as if protesting this disrespect.</t3239>
<t3240>...</t3240> <t3241>and Moira took off her own clothes and put on Aunt Elizabeth's clothes, which, although not a perfect fit, were good enough.</t3241> <t3242>She didn't treat Aunt Elizabeth too harshly, allowing her to wear her own red dress.</t3242> <t3243>She tore the veil into strips and tied Aunt Elizabeth behind the boiler.</t3243> <t3244>She stuffed a piece of cloth into her mouth and tied it with another strip.</t3244> <t3245>She also used a strip to wrap around Aunt Elizabeth's neck and tied it to her feet from behind.</t3245> <t3246>A cunning and dangerous woman, said Aunt Lydia.</t3246>
<t3247>Janine: Can I sit down? she asked.</t3247> <t3248>As if all of this was too much for her.</t3248> <t3249>Finally, she had something to market, at least in exchange for a report card.</t3249>
<t3250>Yes, Janine, said Aunt Lydia, surprised, but knowing that at this point she couldn't refuse.</t3250> <t3251>She wanted Janine's interest, her cooperation.</t3251> <t3252>She pointed to the chair in the corner.</t3252> <t3253>Janine pulled it forward.</t3253>
<t3254>I could have killed you, said Moira, as she safely placed Aunt Elizabeth out of sight behind the stove.</t3254> <t3255>I could have hurt you so badly that you would never recover.</t3255> <t3256>I could have beaten you with this or poked your eye with that thing.</t3256> <t3257>Don't ever forget that I didn't do those things, in case things come to that point.</t3257>
<t3258>Aunt Lydia never told Janine about this part, but I'm sure Moira said similar things.</t3258> <t3259>Anyway, Aunt Elizabeth neither killed nor injured anyone, and after recovering from the seven hours she spent behind the boiler and the probable interrogation—because they did not rule out the possibility of collusion between the Aunts and others—she returned to her job at the Center.</t3259>
<t3260>Moira straightened up and looked ahead with determination.</t3260> <t3261>She pulled her shoulders back, straightened her back, and pursed her lips.</t3261> <t3262>This was not our usual posture.</t3262> <t3263>Generally, we walked with our gaze lowered, eyes on our hands or the ground.</t3263> <t3264>Moira did not much resemble Aunt Elizabeth, even with the brown headscarf, but her upright stance was enough to convince the Angels, who never looked at any of us, not even the Aunts, and perhaps especially not them, because Moira walked out the front door with the demeanor of someone who knew exactly where she was going; she was greeted, showed Aunt Elizabeth's ID, and they didn't bother to check it, because who would dare insult an Aunt in such a manner?</t3264> <t3265>And she disappeared.</t3265>
<t3266>Oh, said Janine.</t3266> <t3267>Who knows what she felt?</t3267> <t3268>Maybe she liked it.</t3268> <t3269>If so, she did a good job of hiding it.</t3269>
<t3270>In this case, Janine, said Aunt Lydia.</t3270> <t3271>This is what I want you to do.</t3271>
<t3272>Janine tried to look innocent and attentive by opening her eyes wide.</t3272>
<t3273>I want you to keep your eyes and ears wide open.</t3273> <t3274>Maybe one of the others is also involved.</t3274>
<t3275>Well, Aunt Lydia, said Janine.</t3275>
<t3276>Then come and tell me, okay, my dear?</t3276> <t3277>If you hear something.</t3277>
<t3278>Well, Aunt Lydia, said Janine.</t3278> <t3279>She had realized that she no longer had to kneel in front of the class and listen to all of us shout that it was her own fault.</t3279> <t3280>Now, for a while, someone else would do that.</t3280> <t3281>She had, temporarily, gotten away with it.</t3281>
<t3282>There was no point in the fact that she told Dolores everything about this encounter in Aunt Lydia's office.</t3282> <t3283>This did not mean that she wouldn't betray us, any of us, when she had the chance.</t3283> <t3284>We knew this.</t3284> <t3285>At that time, we treated her like people used to treat those who sold pens on street corners, who had no legs.</t3285> <t3286>If we could, we avoided her; when that wasn't possible, we treated her with compassion.</t3286> <t3287>She was a danger to us, we knew this.</t3287>
<t3288>Dolores likely patted Janine on the back and said that by telling us this, she proved her friendship.</t3288> <t3289>Where did this conversation take place?</t3289> <t3290>In the gym, while getting ready for bed.</t3290> <t3291>Dolores' bed was next to Janine's.</t3291>
<t3292>The story was told that night, in the semi-darkness, whispered from bed to bed.</t3292>
<t3293>Moira was there, somewhere outside.</t3293> <t3294>She was either free or dead.</t3294> <t3295>What was she going to do?</t3295> <t3296>The thought of what she was going to do expanded and expanded until it filled the room.</t3296> <t3297>At any moment, there could be a clattering explosion, window glass could scatter inside, doors could swing wide open.</t3297> <t3298>...</t3298> <t3299>The power was now with Moira, she had been set free, she had set herself free.</t3299> <t3300>She was now a free woman.</t3300>
<t3301>I think we had found this scary.</t3301>
<t3302>Moira was like an elevator with open sides.</t3302> <t3303>It made our heads spin.</t3303> <t3304>We had already started to lose the taste of freedom and began to find these walls safe.</t3304> <t3305>In the upper layers of the atmosphere, you would disintegrate and evaporate; there would be no pressure to hold you together.</t3305>
<t3306>Still, Moira was our dream.</t3306> <t3307>We had embraced her, she was secretly with us, she was a giggle; the lava beneath the shell of daily life.</t3307> <t3308>Under Moira's light, the Aunts were less frightening and more ridiculous.</t3308> <t3309>A crack had formed in their power.</t3309> <t3310>They could be dealt with in the toilets.</t3310> <t3311>It was the audacity that we liked.</t3311>
<t3312>We were expecting her to be dragged in at any moment, just like before.</t3312> <t3313>This time, we couldn't imagine what they might do to her.</t3313> <t3314>Whatever it was, it was certain to be very bad.</t3314>
<t3315>But nothing happened.</t3315> <t3316>Moira did not reappear.</t3316> <t3317>Not yet.</t3317>
<t3318>23</t3318>
<t3319>This is a reenactment.</t3319> <t3320>All of this is a reenactment.</t3320> <t3321>This is a reenactment now, lying flat on my single bed, rehearsing in my mind what to say and what not to say, what to do and what not to do, how to act.</t3321> <t3322>If I were to get out of here-</t3322>
<t3323>Let's cut it there.</t3323> <t3324>My goal is to get out of here.</t3324> <t3325>This can't last forever.</t3325> <t3326>Others had thought about such things, in previous bad times, they were always right, they got out one way or another and it didn't last forever.</t3326> <t3327>Though it might have lasted as long as all the eternities they knew.</t3327>
<t3328>When I get out of here, if somehow I have the opportunity to record this, even if it is in the form of a voice transmitted from one person to another, it will still be a re-enactment, on yet another plane.</t3328> <t3329>It is impossible to describe something exactly as it happened, because what you narrate can never be complete; you always have to omit something. There are a multitude of details, sides, counter-currents, and differences, a multitude of attitudes that could mean this or that, a multitude of forms that can never be fully described, a multitude of tastes in the air or on the tongue, semi-colors, a multitude.</t3329> <t3330>Perhaps you are a man, sometime in the future, and if you have come this far, please remember this: as a woman, you will never be subjected to the temptation of feeling that you need to forgive a man.</t3330> <t3331>Believe me, it is hard to resist.</t3331> <t3332>But remember that forgiveness is also a power.</t3332> <t3333>To beg for it is a power, to hold it or to transfer it is a power, perhaps the greatest one.</t3333>
<t3334>Maybe this has nothing to do with control.</t3334> <t3335>Maybe this has nothing to do with who can own whom, who can do what to whom, or even where this can go, even up to death.</t3335> <t3336>Maybe it has nothing to do with who can sit and who must kneel, stand, or lie with legs spread.</t3336> <t3337>Maybe it is about who can do what to whom and be forgiven for it.</t3337> <t3338>Don't say that these all lead to the same conclusion.</t3338>
<t3339>I want you to kiss me, said the Commander.</t3339>
<t3340>Yes, of course, something had happened before this.</t3340> <t3341>Such desires never come out of the blue.</t3341>
<t3342>Still, I fell asleep and saw in my dream that I was wearing an earring, one of them was broken; beyond that, there is nothing, just the brain rummaging through old files; and I was awakened by Cora, who came with the dinner tray, time got back on track.</t3342>
<t3343>“Is the baby okay?” says Cora as she sets down the tray.</t3343> <t3344>She must already know; they have a kind of word-of-mouth telegraph system that carries news from house to house. But she likes to hear it, as if my words will make it more real.</t3344> <t3345>“Very good,” I say.</t3345> <t3346>“Healthy.</t3346> <t3347>A girl.</t3347><t3348>”</t3348>
<t3349>Cora is smiling at me, a knowing smile.</t3349> <t3350>These must be the moments that make what she does seem valuable to her.</t3350>
<t3351>"Beautiful," he says.</t3351> <t3352>His voice is almost full of longing and I think: of course.</t3352> <t3353>He would have liked to have been there.</t3353> <t3354>It's like a party he couldn't attend.</t3354>
<t3355>“Maybe we will have one too, soon,” she says, shyly.</t3355> <t3356>By 'we', she means me.</t3356> <t3357>It's up to me to pay for what the team has done, to earn my food and living, like a queen ant with eggs.</t3357> <t3358>Rita may not approve of me, but Cora is not like that.</t3358> <t3359>Instead, she is dependent on me.</t3359> <t3360>She harbors hope, and I am the agent of her hope.</t3360>
<t3361>The simplest kind of hope.</t3361> <t3362>She wants a Birthday, here, with guests, food, and presents, a little child who will pamper her in the kitchen, iron her clothes, and give her candies when no one is looking.</t3362> <t3363>I am the one who will provide her with these happinesses.</t3363> <t3364>I would have preferred not to be approved, I see myself more worthy of this.</t3364>
<t3365>There is beef stew for dinner.</t3365> <t3366>I am having difficulty finishing it because I am remembering something that the day had completely erased from my mind.</t3366> <t3367>What they say is true, it's a state of trance, whether giving birth or just being there, you lose connection with the rest of your life, focusing only on this unique moment.</t3367> <t3368>But now it is coming back to me, and I know I am not ready.</t3368>
<t3369>The clock in the hallway strikes nine.</t3369> <t3370>I press my hands against my hips, take a breath, and walk slowly down the hall and the stairs.</t3370> <t3371>Serena Joy might still be at the house where the Birth is happening; luck, she couldn't have known this beforehand.</t3371> <t3372>On such days, the Wives spend hours opening gifts, gossiping, and getting drunk.</t3372> <t3373>Something must be done to disperse their jealousy.</t3373> <t3374>I trace the downstairs corridor back, passing the door to the kitchen and reaching the next door, hers.</t3374> <t3375>I stand in front of it, feeling like a child summoned to the principal's office at school.</t3375> <t3376>What had I done wrong?</t3376>
<t3377>My presence here is illegal.</t3377> <t3378>It is forbidden for us to be alone with the commanders.</t3378> <t3379>We exist for reproductive purposes: we are not concubines, geishas, or prostitutes.</t3379> <t3380>On the contrary: everything possible has been done to remove us from that category.</t3380> <t3381>There should be nothing entertaining about us, no room for secret passions to flourish; neither they nor we can ingratiate ourselves for special relationships, there should be no basis for love.</t3381> <t3382>We are two-legged wombs, that's all: sacred vessels, wandering chalices.</t3382>
<t3383>So, why does he want to see me, at night, alone?</t3383>
<t3384>If I get caught, I will be handed over to Serena Joy's merciless hands.</t3384> <t3385>The Commander is not expected to interfere in such domestic discipline issues; this is women's work.</t3385> <t3386>This could end up with reclassification.</t3386> <t3387>I could become an Unwoman.</t3387>
<t3388>But refusing to see him could have been worse.</t3388> <t3389>There is no doubt about who holds the real power.</t3389>
<t3390>Still, there must be something he wants from me.</t3390> <t3391>Wanting is weakness.</t3391> <t3392>What tempts me, whatever it is, is this weakness.</t3392> <t3393>Like a small crack in the wall, it is already impossible to grasp.</t3393> <t3394>If I adjust my eye well to this crack, perhaps I can clearly see my way through his weakness.</t3394>
<t3395>I want to know what you want.</t3395>
<t3396>I raise my hand and knock on the door of this forbidden room, where I have never been, and where women do not enter.</t3396> <t3397>Even Serena Joy does not come here, and the cleaning is done by the Guardians.</t3397> <t3398>What secrets, what masculine totems are hidden here?</t3398>
<t3399>I am told to enter.</t3399> <t3400>I open the door and step inside.</t3400>
<t3401>The thing on the other side of the door is normal life.</t3401> <t3402>I should say: The thing on the other side of the door resembles normal life.</t3402> <t3403>There is a desk, of course, with a Compuspeak on it, and a black leather chair behind it.</t3403> <t3404>On the desk, there is a plant in a pot, a writing set, and papers.</t3404> <t3405>On the floor, there is an oriental rug and a non-functional fireplace.</t3405> <t3406>A small sofa covered in brown plush, a television, a coffee table, and a pair of chairs.</t3406>
<t3407>All the walls are covered with bookshelves.</t3407> <t3408>Shelves full of books.</t3408> <t3409>Books, books, and books, completely out in the open, neither locked nor boxed.</t3409> <t3410>It's not surprising that we can't get in here.</t3410> <t3411>This is the oasis of the forbidden.</t3411>
<t3412>I'm trying not to look around with interest.</t3412>
<t3413>The commander is standing in front of the unlit fireplace, with his back turned to it, one elbow on the carved wooden mantelpiece, and the other hand in his pocket.</t3413> <t3414>This is a studied pose, something about provincial gentility, that familiar seductiveness stemming from the allure of polished men.</t3414> <t3415>Perhaps he had decided beforehand to stand like this when I entered.</t3415> <t3416>He must have rushed to the fireplace and assumed his pose when I knocked on the door.</t3416> <t3417>He should have had a black patch over one eye and also a tie.</t3417>
<t3418>Thinking about all these things is very good for me, as fast as staccato, the brain's wobbling.</t3418> <t3419>An inner mockery.</t3419> <t3420>But at the same time, this is panic.</t3420> <t3421>The truth is, I am in terror.</t3421>
<t3422>I'm not saying anything.</t3422>
<t3423>“Close the door behind you,” he says, quite kindly.</t3423> <t3424>I close it and turn around.</t3424>
<t3425>"Hello," he says.</t3425>
<t3426>Old-fashioned greeting.</t3426> <t3427>I hadn't heard it for a long time, for years.</t3427> <t3428>Under these circumstances, it seems out of place, even funny, a leap back in time, a pause.</t3428> <t3429>I can't think of anything appropriate in response.</t3429>
<t3430>I think I will cry.</t3430>
<t3431>He must have noticed this, because he is looking at me, surprised, with a slight frown that I choose to interpret as interest, although it could simply be discomfort.</t3431> <t3432>"Here," he says.</t3432> <t3433>"You can sit."</t3433> <t3434>He pulls out a chair for me and places it in front of his desk.</t3434> <t3435>Then he goes behind his desk and sits down, slowly, which seems overly careful to me.</t3435> <t3436>From this action, I infer that he will not touch me in any way without my consent.</t3436> <t3437>He smiles.</t3437> <t3438>This smile is neither malevolent nor wild.</t3438> <t3439>It's just a smile, a formal smile, friendly but a bit distant, as if I were a kitten in a shop window.</t3439> <t3440>One that he watches but does not consider buying.</t3440>
<t3441>I am sitting upright on the chair, with my hands clasped in my lap.</t3441> <t3442>It feels as if my feet in the red flat shoes are not quite touching the ground.</t3442> <t3443>But of course, that's not true.</t3443>
<t3444>"This must seem strange to you," he says.</t3444>
<t3445>I'm just looking at her.</t3445> <t3446>The phrase of the year; an expression my mother used.</t3446> <t3447>One she had used.</t3447>
<t3448>I feel like cotton candy: sugar and air.</t3448> <t3449>Don't squeeze me, or I'll turn into a small, sickly, and tearful pink-red, damp lump.</t3449>
<t3450>“I guess this is a bit strange,” he says, as if I had responded.</t3450>
<t3451>I think I should have worn a hat, tied under my chin with a bow.</t3451>
<t3452>“What I want...” he says.</t3452>
<t3453>I am restraining myself from leaning forward.</t3453> <t3454>Yes? Yes, yes? Then what? What does he want?</t3454> <t3455>But I won't show it, the enthusiasm I feel.</t3455> <t3456>This is the bargaining period, something is about to be exchanged.</t3456> <t3457>A woman who doesn't wait loses.</t3457> <t3458>I reveal nothing: I only sell.</t3458>
<t3459>“I wish...” he says.</t3459> <t3460>“This will sound silly, but.”</t3460> <t3461>And he really looks bored, exactly like a sheep actually; men used to look like this.</t3461> <t3462>He is old enough to know how to look this way and to remember how attractive women once found it.</t3462> <t3463>Younger people don't know these tricks.</t3463> <t3464>They never had to use them.</t3464>
<t3465>"I would like you to play a game of Scrabble8 with me," he says.</t3465>
<t3466>I hold myself completely rigid.</t3466> <t3467>My face too, motionless.</t3467> <t3468>So this is what was in the forbidden room!</t3468> <t3469>Scrabble! I want to laugh, laugh hysterically, enough to fall off my chair.</t3469> <t3470>This was a game that old men and women used to play in their villas, where they spent their retirement or wrote, when there was nothing good on television.</t3470> <t3471>Or adults, once upon a time, a very long time ago.</t3471> <t3472>My mother had one too, it used to sit at the bottom of the closet in the hall, along with the Christmas tree ornaments in cardboard boxes.</t3472> <t3473>Once she had tried to get me interested in this game, when I was thirteen and miserable and unhappy.</t3473>
<t3474>Now, undoubtedly, this is something different.</t3474> <t3475>Now it is forbidden to us.</t3475> <t3476>Now it is dangerous.</t3476> <t3477>Now it is immoral.</t3477> <t3478>Now it is something he can't do with his Wife.</t3478> <t3479>Now it is something desirable.</t3479> <t3480>Now he has put himself in danger.</t3480> <t3481>As if he had offered me drugs.</t3481>
<t3482>"Alright," I say, indifferently.</t3482> <t3483>In fact, I can barely speak.</t3483>
<t3484>He doesn't say why he wants to play Scrabble with me.</t3484> <t3485>And I don't ask him.</t3485> <t3486>He just takes a box out of one of his desk drawers and opens it.</t3486> <t3487>Here are the tiles made of hard plastic that I remember, the game board divided into squares, and the small racks to place the letters on.</t3487> <t3488>He dumps the tiles onto his desk and starts to turn them over.</t3488> <t3489>A moment later, I join in.</t3489>
<t3490>“Do you know how to play it?” he says.</t3490>
<t3491>I nod my head.</t3491>
<t3492>We are playing with two hands.</t3492> <t3493>I spell it as Larynx.</t3493> <t3494>Valance.</t3494> <t3495>Quince.</t3495> <t3496>Zygote9.</t3496> <t3497>Holding the bright stones by their straight edges, I touch the letters.</t3497> <t3498>This is a very sensual feeling.</t3498> <t3499>This is freedom.</t3499> <t3500>The wink of freedom.</t3500> <t3501>I spell it as Limp10.</t3501> <t3502>Gorge.</t3502> <t3503>What luxury.</t3503> <t3504>The stones are like candy, minty, refreshing.</t3504> <t3505>They were called mint caramel.</t3505> <t3506>I would like to put them in my mouth.</t3506> <t3507>They also give a lemon taste.</t3507> <t3508>The letter K.</t3508> <t3509>Sharp, slightly sour on the tongue, delicious.</t3509>
<t3510>I win the first game, I let him win the second: I still haven't figured out what the conditions are, what I can ask for in return.</t3510>
<t3511>He tells me that it's finally time to go home.</t3511> <t3512>These are the words he uses: go home.</t3512> <t3513>He means my room.</t3513> <t3514>He asks if I can go alone, as if the stairs were a dark alley.</t3514> <t3515>I can go, I say. We open the door to the study, a slight creak, we listen for any sounds that might come from the hall.</t3515>
<t3516>It's like dating someone.</t3516> <t3517>It's like sneaking into the dormitory hours later.</t3517>
<t3518>This is intrigue.</t3518>
<t3519>“Thank you,” she says.</t3519> <t3520>“For the game.”</t3520> <t3521>Then she says, “I want you to kiss me.”</t3521>
<t3522>I am thinking about how I can quickly and quietly remove the back of the toilet in my own bathroom on a bath night, so that Cora, who is sitting outside, won't hear me.</t3522> <t3523>I could take out the sharp lever, hide it inside my dress sleeve, and sneak into the Commander's study the next time, because after such a request, there will definitely be another time, whether you say yes or no.</t3523> <t3524>I am thinking about how I could approach the Commander, when I am alone here, to kiss him, how I could take off his jacket, as if allowing or inviting something more, a kind of approach to real love, how I could wrap my arms around him and slide the lever from my dress sleeve and suddenly thrust the sharp end into him, between his ribs.</t3524> <t3525>I am thinking about the blood that would gush from him, as thin as soup, between my lustful hands.</t3525>
<t3526>Actually, I don't think about this kind of thing at all.</t3526> <t3527>I just added these later.</t3527> <t3528>Maybe I should have thought about these at the time, but I didn't.</t3528> <t3529>As I said, this is a reenactment.</t3529>
<t3530>“Okay,” I say.</t3530> <t3531>I approach him and place my closed lips on his.</t3531> <t3532>I pause, recognizing the familiar scent of aftershave lotion, reminiscent of mothballs I'm quite used to.</t3532> <t3533>But he feels like someone I've just met.</t3533>
<t3534>He steps back and looks at me.</t3534> <t3535>There it is again, that sheepish smile.</t3535> <t3536>What sincerity.</t3536> <t3537>“Not like this,” he says.</t3537> <t3538>“Make it seem like you really want it.</t3538><t3539>”</t3539>
<t3540>He was so sad.</t3540>
<t3541>This is also a reenactment.</t3541>
<t3542>IX</t3542>
<t3543>Night</t3543>
<t3544>24</t3544>
<t3545>I walk along the dim hallway and up the carpeted stairs, to my room, secretly.</t3545> <t3546>There, I sit on the chair, lights off, wearing my red dress, tied and buttoned.</t3546> <t3547>You can only think clearly when you have your clothes on.</t3547>
<t3548>What I need is a perspective.</t3548> <t3549>The depth imagery created by a frame, the arrangement of shapes on a flat surface.</t3549> <t3550>Perspective is necessary.</t3550> <t3551>Otherwise, you are left with just two dimensions.</t3551> <t3552>Otherwise, you live with your face pressed against a wall, everything becomes a massive foreground, details, close-ups, hair, the weave of the sheet, the molecules of the face.</t3552> <t3553>Your skin, like a map crisscrossed with fine paths leading nowhere, a diagram of uselessness.</t3553> <t3554>Otherwise, you live in the moment.</t3554> <t3555>This is not where I want to be.</t3555>
<t3556>However, this is where I am, there is no escape from this.</t3556> <t3557>Time is a trap, and I have fallen into it.</t3557> <t3558>I must forget my secret name and all the ways back.</t3558> <t3559>My name is now Fredinki and this is where I live.</t3559>
<t3560>Live in the present, enjoy it, everything you have is this.</t3560>
<t3561>It's time for accounting.</t3561>
<t3562>I am thirty-three years old.</t3562> <t3563>I have brown hair.</t3563> <t3564>My height without shoes is 1.</t3564> <t3565>70 m.</t3565> <t3566>I have difficulty remembering what I used to look like.</t3566> <t3567>I have suitable ovaries.</t3567> <t3568>I have one more chance.</t3568>
<t3569>But something changed, now, tonight.</t3569> <t3570>The conditions have altered.</t3570>
<t3571>I might ask for something.</t3571> <t3572>It's not very likely; but something.</t3572>
<t3573>Men are sex machines, Aunt Lydia used to say, that's all.</t3573> <t3574>They want only one thing.</t3574> <t3575>For your own good, you must learn to manage them.</t3575> <t3576>Wrap them around your finger; this is a metaphor.</t3576> <t3577>This is the way of nature.</t3577> <t3578>God's invention.</t3578> <t3579>This is how things work.</t3579>
<t3580>Aunt Lydia didn't actually say these things, but they were understood from what she said.</t3580> <t3581>They were hovering above her head, just like the golden aphorisms above the saints of darker ages.</t3581> <t3582>Like them, Aunt Lydia was also bony and fleshless.</t3582>
<t3583>But how should we fit the Commander into this frame, while existing in the study room, with wordplay and desire, who knows for what?</t3583> <t3584>To accompany his game, to be kissed gently, as if I truly wanted it.</t3584>
<t3585>I know that I need to take this, his desire, seriously.</t3585> <t3586>This could be important, it could be a passport, it could be my downfall.</t3586> <t3587>I need to take this seriously, I need to ponder over it.</t3587> <t3588>But no matter what I do, while sitting here in the dark, with the spotlights illuminating the rectangle of my window through the curtains that are as transparent as a wedding dress, as transparent as outer plasma, while one hand holds the other, gently swaying back and forth, no matter what I do, there is something insanely ridiculous about this.</t3588>
<t3589>She wanted me to play Scrabble with her and kiss her as if I really wanted to.</t3589>
<t3590>This is one of the strangest things that has ever happened to me.</t3590> <t3591>Everything is context.</t3591>
<t3592>I remember a television program I once watched; a rerun, made years ago.</t3592> <t3593>I must have been seven or eight years old, too young to understand it.</t3593> <t3594>It was the kind of thing my mother enjoyed watching: historical, educational.</t3594> <t3595>She had later tried to explain to me, to tell me that the things in it were real, but to me, it was just a story.</t3595> <t3596>I thought someone had made it up.</t3596> <t3597>I think all children feel this way about times before their own.</t3597> <t3598>If it's just a story, it's less frightening.</t3598>
<t3599>The program was a documentary about one of those wars.</t3599> <t3600>They were interviewing people and showing clips and photos from the black and white films of that time.</t3600> <t3601>I don't remember much, but I do recall the quality of the pictures, how everything in them was covered with a mixture of daylight and dust, and how dark the shadows under people's eyebrows and on their cheekbones were.</t3601>
<t3602>The interviews conducted with people who were still alive at that time were colorful.</t3602> <t3603>The one I remember best was with a woman who had been the mistress of a man who managed one of the camps where Jews were confined before being killed.</t3603> <t3604>They would put them in ovens, my mother said; but there were no pictures of the ovens, so I developed a complicated idea that these deaths occurred in kitchens.</t3604> <t3605>There is something particularly frightening about this idea for a child.</t3605> <t3606>An oven means cooking, and cooking comes before eating.</t3606> <t3607>I thought these people were being eaten.</t3607> <t3608>And I guess in a way they were.</t3608>
<t3609>According to what they said, this man was ruthless and savage.</t3609> <t3610>Mistress - my mother explained what a mistress was, she didn't believe in secrecy, I had a book describing sexual organs when I was four years old - was once very beautiful.</t3610> <t3611>There was a black and white photo of her and another woman, with the two-piece swimsuits, high heels, and wide-brimmed hats of that time; they were wearing cat-eye sunglasses, sitting on lounge chairs by a swimming pool.</t3611> <t3612>The swimming pool was next to their house, and the house was near the camp where the ovens were located.</t3612> <t3613>The woman said she didn't notice anything that seemed unusual to her.</t3613> <t3614>She denied knowing about the ovens.</t3614>
<t3615>During the interview, forty or fifty years later, he was about to die from emphysema.</t3615> <t3616>He was coughing a lot and was very thin, almost skin and bones; but he was still proud of his appearance.</t3616> <t3617>(Look at him, said my mother, half angry, half admiring.</t3617> <t3618>He is still proud of his appearance.</t3618><t3619>)</t3619> <t3620>He had carefully applied makeup, with dark mascara on his eyelashes and blush on his cheekbones, which were as taut as a tightly pulled rubber glove.</t3620> <t3621>He was wearing pearls.</t3621>
<t3622>Adam was not a monster, said the woman.</t3622> <t3623>People say he was a monster, but he was not.</t3623>
<t3624>What could he have been thinking?</t3624> <t3625>Not much, I guess; not at that time and in that moment.</t3625> <t3626>He was thinking about how not to think.</t3626> <t3627>Those times were abnormal.</t3627> <t3628>He was proud of his appearance.</t3628> <t3629>He didn't believe the man was a monster.</t3629> <t3630>To him, the man was not a monster.</t3630> <t3631>Maybe the man had a lovable trait: he would whistle in the shower, loved truffles, and called his dog Liebchen, making it stand on its hind legs for small pieces of raw meat.</t3631> <t3632>How easy it is to find a humane side in anyone.</t3632> <t3633>What a useful provocation.</t3633> <t3634>She must have thought to herself, big child.</t3634> <t3635>Her heart would soften, she would push back the hair falling on the man's forehead, kiss his ear, and she wouldn't do it just to get something from him.</t3635> <t3636>The urge to soothe, to make things better.</t3636> <t3637>Come on, come on, she would say when the man woke up from a nightmare.</t3637> <t3638>Everything is so hard for you.</t3638> <t3639>She must have believed all this, otherwise how could she continue to live?</t3639> <t3640>So ordinary, beneath that beauty.</t3640> <t3641>She believed in kindness, she was kind to the Jewish maid or kind enough, kinder than necessary.</t3641>
<t3642>A few days after this interview was filmed, he killed himself.</t3642> <t3643>They said this directly on television.</t3643>
<t3644>Nobody asked if anyone liked that man.</t3644>
<t3645>Now, what I remember the most is her makeup.</t3645>
<t3646>I'm standing up in the dark, starting to unbutton my clothes.</t3646> <t3647>Then I hear something, somewhere inside my body.</t3647> <t3648>I broke something, something cracked, it must be like this.</t3648> <t3649>The noise rises from the broken place on my face, escaping outside.</t3649> <t3650>Without warning: I wasn't thinking about here, there, or anything.</t3650> <t3651>If I let the noise out, it will turn into laughter, excessively loud, too much, someone will definitely hear, then there will be hurried footsteps and orders and who knows what else!</t3651> <t3652>Judgment: enthusiasm inappropriate to the situation.</t3652> <t3653>Wandering womb, they used to think.</t3653> <t3654>Hysteria.</t3654> <t3655>Then a needle, a pill.</t3655> <t3656>It could have been fatal.</t3656>
<t3657>I cover my mouth with both hands, feeling like I'm about to vomit, I drop to my knees, laughter bubbling in my throat like lava.</t3657> <t3658>I crawl towards the closet, pulling my knees up, trying to suppress the laughter.</t3658> <t3659>My ribs ache from holding it in, I'm shaking, swelling, seismic, volcanic, about to explode.</t3659> <t3660>The closet has turned completely red, birth rhymes with joint, oh my god, I'm going to die from laughing.</t3660>
<t3661>I am stifling my laughter among the folds of the hanging cloak, closing my eyes where the tears seep out.</t3661> <t3662>I am trying to pull myself together.</t3662>
<t3663>After a while, it passes, like an epileptic seizure.</t3663> <t3664>I'm here, inside the closet.</t3664> <t3665>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t3665> <t3666>I can't see in the dark, but I feel the engraved writing with my fingertips as if it were written in Braille.</t3666> <t3667>It's no longer a prayer but more like a command in my mind; but for what purpose?</t3667> <t3668>Whatever it is, it's useless, an old hieroglyph whose key has been lost, for me.</t3668> <t3669>Why did she write this, why did she bother with this?</t3669> <t3670>There's no way out of here.</t3670>
<t3671>I am lying on the ground, breathing very fast, then slower, correcting my breath, like in the exercises done for childbirth.</t3671> <t3672>Now all I hear is the sound of my own heart, opening and closing, opening and closing, opening.</t3672>
<t3673>X</t3673>
<t3674>Two Cylinders</t3674>
<t3675>25</t3675>
<t3676>The first thing I heard the next morning was a scream followed by a clatter.</t3676> <t3677>It was Cora who had dropped the breakfast tray.</t3677> <t3678>She woke me up.</t3678> <t3679>My head was on the bundled-up cloak, still halfway inside the closet.</t3679> <t3680>I must have pulled the cloak from the hanger and fallen asleep there; for a moment, I couldn't remember where I was.</t3680> <t3681>Cora had knelt beside me, I felt her hand touch my back.</t3681> <t3682>When I moved, she screamed again.</t3682>
<t3683>What is the matter? I asked.</t3683> <t3684>I turned and straightened up.</t3684>
<t3685>Oh, he said.</t3685> <t3686>I thought so.</t3686>
<t3687>What did they think, I wonder?</t3687>
<t3688>As if... he said.</t3688>
<t3689>The eggs that fell to the ground were broken, there was orange juice and pieces of glass on the floor.</t3689>
<t3690>We need to bring another one, he said.</t3690> <t3691>What a pity.</t3691> <t3692>What were you doing on the ground like this?</t3692> <t3693>He was respectfully extending his hand to lift me up.</t3693>
<t3694>I didn't want to say that I never got into bed.</t3694> <t3695>There could be no explanation for that.</t3695> <t3696>I said that I must have passed out.</t3696> <t3697>This was almost as bad as the other, because she immediately caught on.</t3697>
<t3698>One of the first signs, he said contentedly.</t3698> <t3699>This and vomiting.</t3699> <t3700>He must have known that not enough time had passed; still, he was very hopeful.</t3700>
<t3701>No, this isn't it, I said.</t3701> <t3702>I was sitting on the chair.</t3702> <t3703>I'm sure this isn't it.</t3703> <t3704>My head was just spinning.</t3704> <t3705>While standing here, everything suddenly went dark.</t3705>
<t3706>It must be the tension of yesterday and everything, he said.</t3706> <t3707>The pain is coming out now.</t3707>
<t3708>He was referring to the birth, and I confirmed it.</t3708> <t3709>Meanwhile, I was sitting on the beige chair, and he was bent over, picking up the broken glass and egg pieces and putting them on the tray.</t3709> <t3710>He soaked up some of the orange juice with a paper napkin.</t3710>
<t3711>I should bring a cloth, she said.</t3711> <t3712>They will want to know the reason for the extra eggs.</t3712> <t3713>Unless you don't want to, of course.</t3713> <t3714>She lifted her head and looked at me sideways and cunningly, and I realized it would be better if we both pretended I had already had my breakfast.</t3714> <t3715>If she said she found me lying on the floor, a barrage of questions would follow.</t3715> <t3716>She would still have to account for the broken glass; however, if she had to prepare a second breakfast, Rita would get cranky.</t3716>
<t3717>I can manage without breakfast, I said.</t3717> <t3718>I wasn't that hungry.</t3718> <t3719>This was good, it matched the dizziness.</t3719> <t3720>Still, I can eat the toast, I said.</t3720> <t3721>I didn't want to go without eating anything at all.</t3721>
<t3722>He fell down, but he said.</t3722>
<t3723>Never mind, I said.</t3723> <t3724>While she went to the bathroom and threw a handful of now useless eggs into the toilet and flushed them, I sat there and started eating a slice of brown bread.</t3724> <t3725>She came back a little later.</t3725>
<t3726>"I will say that I dropped the tray while going up," he said.</t3726>
<t3727>It pleased me that he intended to lie to me, even on such a simple matter and for his own benefit.</t3727> <t3728>This was a bond between us.</t3728>
<t3729>I smiled at her.</t3729> <t3730>I hope no one heard you, I said.</t3730>
<t3731>While standing in the doorway with the tray, she took my breath away, he said.</t3731> <t3732>At first, I thought they were just your clothes.</t3732> <t3733>Then I asked myself, what are they doing on the floor?</t3733> <t3734>I thought, maybe you...</t3734>
<t3735>He/She has escaped..., I said.</t3735>
<t3736>Um, but, he said.</t3736> <t3737>But it was you.</t3737>
<t3738>Yes, I said.</t3738> <t3739>I bent.</t3739>
<t3740>I bent down; she returned with a piece of cloth to collect the remnants of the orange juice from the tray.</t3740> <t3741>That afternoon, Rita made a sarcastic comment about some people's incompetence.</t3741> <t3742>They don't look where they're going, their heads in the clouds, she said, as if nothing had happened.</t3742> <t3743>We continued from where we left off.</t3743>
<t3744>This happened in May.</t3744> <t3745>We had passed the spring.</t3745> <t3746>The tulips had lived their days, now they were wilting, shedding their petals one by one like teeth.</t3746> <t3747>One day, I encountered Serena Joy kneeling on a cushion in the garden, her cane resting on the grass beside her.</t3747> <t3748>She was cutting seed pods with scissors.</t3748> <t3749>I watched her from the side as I passed by with my basket containing oranges and lamb chops.</t3749> <t3750>She was aiming carefully and cutting by pressing her hands firmly, adjusting the blades of the scissors.</t3750> <t3751>Was her arthritis getting worse?</t3751> <t3752>Or was this a kind of kamikaze attack directed at the swollen sexual organs of the flowers?</t3752> <t3753>The fruit-bearing body.</t3753> <t3754>It is assumed that by cutting the seed pods, the flower bulb is enabled to store energy.</t3754>
<t3755>Saint Serena is confessing her sins on her knees.</t3755>
<t3756>I often amused myself by making shallow, bitter jokes about him; but not for too long.</t3756> <t3757>It's not advisable to waste time watching Serena Joy from behind.</t3757>
<t3758>The thing I envied was the scissors.</t3758>
<t3759>Alright.</t3759> <t3760>Back then, we had irises in light blue, light lilac, darker shades, velvet and purple colors, with long stems rising beautifully and coolly like shattered glass, frozen in mid-splash like pastel water; cat ears under the sun, indigo shadow, and girl hearts: Their forms were so feminine that it was surprising they hadn't been uprooted yet.</t3760> <t3761>There was something destructive in Serena's garden, an intuition that buried things were throwing themselves into the light without uttering a single word; as if they were saying: The silenced will make a clamor to be heard, even if silently.</t3761> <t3762>A Tennyson garden, heavy and faint with scents; the return of the word "languid."</t3762> <t3763>It's true that sunlight spreads over them, but heat also rises from the flowers, this can be felt: like holding your hand just above an arm, a shoulder.</t3763> <t3764>Breathing in the heat, drawing it into itself.</t3764> <t3765>These days, wandering in the garden among peonies, pink and light red carnations makes my head spin.</t3765>
<t3766>The willow has blossomed and is not at all helpful, with its suggestive whispers.</t3766> <t3767>The terraces speak of appointments, vowels tickle my spine, a shiver comes over me as if I have a fever.</t3767> <t3768>Summer clothes rustle against the flesh of my hips, grass grows under my feet, I notice some movements out of the corner of my eye, on the branches; feathers, flutters, piercing notes, trees turning into birds, metamorphosis running wild.</t3768> <t3769>Goddesses are now possible and the air is filled with desire.</t3769> <t3770>Even the roof tiles of the house soften, becoming touchable, if I lean on them, they would warm up and give way.</t3770> <t3771>The things that suppressed desires can do are astonishing.</t3771> <t3772>When I dropped my ID at the checkpoint yesterday and allowed him to pick it up for me, did seeing my ankle make his head spin and daze him?</t3772> <t3773>Neither handkerchief nor fan, I use what is at hand.</t3773>
<t3774>Winter is not so dangerous.</t3774> <t3775>I need hardness, cold, immobility, as if I were a watermelon on the vine, not this liquid ripeness, this heaviness.</t3775>
<t3776>There is an agreement between the commander and me.</t3776> <t3777>It's not the first agreement of its kind in history, though its form is unusual.</t3777>
<t3778>I visit the Commander two or three nights a week, always after dinner, but only when I receive the signal.</t3778> <t3779>The signal is Nick.</t3779> <t3780>If he is polishing the car when I go shopping or when I return, and his hat is tilted on his head or he is not wearing it at all, I go.</t3780> <t3781>If he is not there or his hat is properly on, I stay in my room as usual.</t3781> <t3782>On ceremony nights, of course, none of this applies.</t3782>
<t3783>The Wife is a problem, as usual.</t3783> <t3784>After dinner, despite my efforts to be very quiet, she goes to the bedrooms where she might hear me as I slowly crawl through the hallway.</t3784> <t3785>Or she stays in the living room, creating people out of meters of complicated and useless yarn and continuing to knit endless Angel scarves: This must be her way of producing.</t3785> <t3786>When she is inside, the living room door is usually left ajar, and I do not dare to pass through there.</t3786> <t3787>When I am signaled and cannot comply, when I cannot go down the stairs and pass through the hallway in front of the living room, the Commander understands this.</t3787> <t3788>He knows my situation, at the very least.</t3788> <t3789>He knows all the rules.</t3789>
<t3790>Still, from time to time, Serena Joy is out, visiting another Commander's Wife, someone who is sick; perhaps the only place she can go on her own in the evenings.</t3790> <t3791>She takes food with her, a cake or pie baked by Rita, or a loaf of bread, or a jar of marmalade made from mint leaves grown in her garden.</t3791> <t3792>The Commanders' Wives tend to be sick quite often.</t3792> <t3793>This gives importance to their lives.</t3793> <t3794>As for us, the Handmaids and even the Marthas, we avoid illness.</t3794> <t3795>The Marthas don't want to be forced into retirement, because who knows where they would go?</t3795> <t3796>There aren't many old women around anymore.</t3796> <t3797>As for us, any real illness, anything debilitating, weight or appetite loss, hair loss, malfunctioning glands would be fatal.</t3797> <t3798>I remember Cora, who, despite having the flu in early spring, walked around staggering, holding onto door frames when she thought no one was looking, and taking care not to cough.</t3798> <t3799>When Serena asked, she said, I just caught a bit of a chill.</t3799>
<t3800>Serena takes a few days off.</t3800> <t3801>In this case, she is the one to be accompanied, and the other Wives go up the stairs, clucking and cheerfully, rustling; this time, she is the one receiving the cakes and pastries, the marmalades, and the bouquets of flowers from their gardens.</t3801>
<t3802>They do this in turns.</t3802> <t3803>There is a kind of list, invisible, unspoken.</t3803> <t3804>Each one takes care not to attack more than their fair share of attention.</t3804>
<t3805>On the nights when Serena has to be out, it is certain that I will be called.</t3805>
<t3806>The first time, I was confused.</t3806> <t3807>The requirements were unclear to me, and what I could perceive seemed foolish and ridiculous, like a fetish for lace-up shoes.</t3807>
<t3808>On the other hand, I was disappointed.</t3808> <t3809>What was I expecting behind that closed door the first time?</t3809> <t3810>Something indescribable with words: crawling on the ground on all fours, perversions, whips, mutilations?</t3810> <t3811>At least some minor sexual coercions, some small crimes left in the past now deprived, things forbidden by law and punishable by the amputation of a limb.</t3811> <t3812>Instead of these, being asked to play Scrabble like an old married couple or two children seemed extremely strange to me, like a violation in its own way.</t3812> <t3813>It was vague as a request.</t3813>
<t3814>That's why, when I left the room, it was still not clear to me why He wanted what He wanted or whether I could fulfill any of these for Him.</t3814> <t3815>If there is going to be a negotiation, the terms of the deal must be laid out.</t3815> <t3816>It was certain that He had not done this.</t3816> <t3817>I had thought that He might be playing with me like a cat with a mouse, but now I think that His impulses and desires were not even clear to Himself.</t3817> <t3818>They had not yet reached the level of words.</t3818>
<t3819>The second evening began just like the first.</t3819> <t3820>I went to the closed door, knocked, and was told to come in.</t3820> <t3821>This was followed by two games of Scrabble played with smooth beige tiles.</t3821> <t3822>Prolix, quartz, quandary, sylph, rhythm11, all those old tricks I could remember with consonants.</t3822> <t3823>My tongue was swollen with the effort of spelling.</t3823> <t3824>It was like using a language I once knew but had almost forgotten, a language related to customs long gone from this world.</t3824> <t3825>On a balcony table, café au lait, a brioche12 beside it, absinthe in a tall glass or shrimp in a newspaper cone; things I once read about but never saw.</t3825> <t3826>Like the fake scenes in old TV movies, it was like trying to walk without crutches: You can do it.</t3826> <t3827>I know you can do it.</t3827> <t3828>My mind, sliding over the round vowels as if on pebbles, staggering and stumbling among the sharp r's and t's, this is how it was.</t3828>
<t3829>When I hesitated or consulted him for the correct spelling, the Commander was patient.</t3829> <t3830>We can always look it up in the dictionary, he would say.</t3830> <t3831>We, he would say.</t3831> <t3832>For the first time, I realized that he had allowed me to win.</t3832>
<t3833>That night, I expected everything to be the same, including the goodnight kiss.</t3833> <t3834>But when we finished the second game, he leaned back in his chair.</t3834> <t3835>He placed his elbows on the arms of the chair, joined his fingertips together, and looked at me.</t3835>
<t3836>I have a small gift for you, he said.</t3836>
<t3837>He smiled slightly.</t3837> <t3838>Then he opened the top drawer of his desk and took something out.</t3838> <t3839>As if deciding whether or not to give it to me, he held it between two fingers, quite indifferently, for a moment.</t3839> <t3840>Even though it was upside down from where I was sitting, I recognized it.</t3840> <t3841>They were quite common once.</t3841> <t3842>It was a magazine, judging by the picture, a women's magazine, on glossy paper, with a photo model with flowing hair, a scarf around her neck, and painted lips; fashion mode.</t3842> <t3843>I thought all such magazines had been destroyed, but here was one, in a place where you would never expect to find such a thing, in a Commander's private study.</t3843> <t3844>He looked at the photo model, who was upright from his perspective; he was still smiling, that desirous smile of his.</t3844> <t3845>It was the kind of look you might direct at an almost extinct animal in a zoo.</t3845>
<t3846>I desired this magazine as the commander dangled it in front of me like fish bait.</t3846> <t3847>I desired it with a force that made my fingertips tingle.</t3847> <t3848>At the same time, I found my desire unnecessary and absurd, because I had once greatly underestimated such magazines.</t3848> <t3849>I would read them in dentists' waiting rooms, sometimes on planes, and buy them to take to hotel rooms.</t3849> <t3850>A tool to fill the empty time while waiting for Luke.</t3850> <t3851>After flipping through them, I would throw them away, because they were extremely disposable things and I couldn't remember what was in them a couple of days later.</t3851>
<t3852>But now I remembered.</t3852> <t3853>What was inside them was a promise.</t3853> <t3854>They traded in transformations; like reflections in two mirrors facing each other, expanding, extending image upon image to the point of disappearance, they offered an infinite series of possibilities: Adventure upon adventure, wardrobe upon wardrobe, development upon development, man upon man.</t3854> <t3855>What they proposed was rejuvenation, pain overcome and surpassed, and eternal love.</t3855> <t3856>The true promise they offered was immortality.</t3856>
<t3857>This was what he was holding without realizing it.</t3857> <t3858>He flipped through the pages.</t3858> <t3859>I felt myself leaning forward.</t3859>
<t3860>An old thing, he said, a rare piece.</t3860> <t3861>From the seventies, I think.</t3861> <t3862>A Vogue.</t3862> <t3863>Like a wine expert whose name is renowned.</t3863> <t3864>I thought you might want to take a look.</t3864>
<t3865>I hesitated.</t3865> <t3866>He might have been testing me to see how deep my doctrinal loyalty went.</t3866> <t3867>It's forbidden, I said.</t3867>
<t3868>Not here, he said calmly.</t3868> <t3869>I grasped the situation.</t3869> <t3870>Since I had broken the fundamental taboo, why would I hesitate to go after a smaller one?</t3870> <t3871>Or another one, then another one; who could know where it would stop?</t3871> <t3872>Behind this particular door, the taboo was unraveling.</t3872>
<t3873>I took the magazine from him and translated it to suit myself.</t3873> <t3874>There they were again, the images of my childhood: bold, walking with long strides, confident, arms thrown up as if claiming a right, legs apart, feet firmly planted on the ground.</t3874> <t3875>There was a Renaissance air in this pose, yet the princesses that crossed my mind were not women with curly hair.</t3875> <t3876>Those eyes, shadowed with makeup, are fine but they resemble the eyes of cats turned to stone, ready to pounce on their prey.</t3876> <t3877>In these capes and coarse tweeds, in those knee-high boots, there is no trace of timidity or insecurity.</t3877> <t3878>These women, with their feminine briefcases used to carry their spoils and their horse-like, greedy teeth, are pirates.</t3878>
<t3879>As I turned the pages, I could feel the Commander watching me.</t3879> <t3880>I knew I was doing something I shouldn't be doing, and that he enjoyed watching me.</t3880> <t3881>I was supposed to feel sinful; according to Aunt Lydia's perception, I was sinful.</t3881> <t3882>However, I didn't feel that way.</t3882> <t3883>Instead, I felt like an old Edwards' seaside postcard: immoral.</t3883> <t3884>What would he give me next, I wondered?</t3884> <t3885>A corset?</t3885>
<t3886>Why are you hiding this, I asked.</t3886>
<t3887>Some of us, he said, still value old things.</t3887>
<t3888>Still, they should have been burned, I said.</t3888> <t3889>There were house-to-house searches, bonfires...</t3889>
<t3890>Things that could be dangerous in the hands of the masses, he said, whether ironically or not, are safe in our hands, the impulses...</t3890>
<t3891>Those who are perfect, I said.</t3891>
<t3892>He shook his head with distress.</t3892> <t3893>It was impossible to say whether he did it sincerely.</t3893>
<t3894>Well, why did you show it to me? I asked and felt like an idiot.</t3894> <t3895>What could he say?</t3895> <t3896>That he amused himself at the expense of hurting me?</t3896> <t3897>After all, he should have known how painful it was for me to remember the old times.</t3897>
<t3898>I was truly not at all ready for what he said.</t3898> <t3899>Who else could I show it to? he said, the same sad expression settling on his face again.</t3899>
<t3900>Should I go further? I thought.</t3900> <t3901>I didn't want to push him too much and too fast.</t3901> <t3902>In the end, I was something that could be given up.</t3902> <t3903>Still, I couldn't help myself and in a very soft tone, I said, Well, what about your wife?</t3903>
<t3904>He seemed to think about it for a while.</t3904> <t3905>No, he said afterward.</t3905> <t3906>He wouldn't understand.</t3906> <t3907>Anyway, he doesn't talk to me much anymore.</t3907> <t3908>These days, we don't seem to have much in common.</t3908>
<t3909>Here it was, out in the open: His wife did not understand him.</t3909>
<t3910>So, that was the reason for my being there.</t3910> <t3911>Again, the same old, familiar thing.</t3911> <t3912>It was too banal to be real.</t3912>
<t3913>On the third night, I asked him for some hand lotion.</t3913> <t3914>I didn't want to appear as if I were begging, but I wanted the things I could obtain.</t3914>
<t3915>A little what? he asked, as polite as ever.</t3915> <t3916>He was diagonally across the table from me.</t3916> <t3917>Apart from that one obligatory kiss, he hardly touched me.</t3917> <t3918>No rough groping or heavy breathing, there was none of that; it would somehow be inappropriate for both him and me.</t3918>
<t3919>The lotion, I said.</t3919> <t3920>Or the face lotion.</t3920> <t3921>Our skin gets very dry.</t3921> <t3922>For some reason, I had said our instead of my.</t3922> <t3923>I wished to ask for those little colored balls of bath oil that you could easily get in the past and which seemed magical to me when they existed in a round glass bowl in my mother's bathroom at home.</t3923> <t3924>But I thought he wouldn't understand what they were.</t3924> <t3925>Besides, they might not be made anymore.</t3925>
<t3926>Is it drying up? said the Commander, as if it had never occurred to him before.</t3926> <t3927>What are you doing about this?</t3927>
<t3928>We use butter, I said.</t3928> <t3929>When we can get it.</t3929> <t3930>Or margarine.</t3930> <t3931>We often use margarine.</t3931>
<t3932>Butter, he said, thoughtfully.</t3932> <t3933>Very clever.</t3933> <t3934>Butter.</t3934> <t3935>He laughed.</t3935>
<t3936>I could have slapped him.</t3936>
<t3937>I think I can get a little, he said, as if turning a blind eye to a child's wish for gum.</t3937> <t3938>But my wife might smell it.</t3938>
<t3939>I wondered if this fear stemmed from past experiences.</t3939> <t3940>A long past: lipstick stains on the collar of a shirt, the scent of perfume on the cuffs, a scene, late at night, in a kitchen or a bedroom.</t3940> <t3941>A man devoid of such experiences wouldn't think of this.</t3941> <t3942>Unless he is more cunning than he appears.</t3942>
<t3943>I will be careful, I said.</t3943> <t3944>Besides, he never gets this close to me.</t3944>
<t3945>Sometimes he is approaching, but he said.</t3945>
<t3946>I lowered my gaze.</t3946> <t3947>I had forgotten this.</t3947> <t3948>I could feel myself blushing.</t3948> <t3949>I don't use it on those nights, I said.</t3949>
<t3950>On the fourth evening, he gave me hand lotion in an unlabelled plastic bottle.</t3950> <t3951>It wasn't of very good quality; it smelled slightly of vegetable oil.</t3951> <t3952>He probably wasn't going to give me Lily of the Valley.</t3952> <t3953>It could have been something they made in hospitals to use for bedsores.</t3953> <t3954>Still, I thanked him.</t3954>
<t3955>The problem, I said, is that I don't have a place to hide this.</t3955>
<t3956>"Keep it in Dutch," he said, as if it were something very obvious.</t3956>
<t3957>They will find it, I said.</t3957> <t3958>Someone will find it.</t3958>
<t3959>Why? he asked, as if he truly didn't know.</t3959> <t3960>Maybe he really didn't know.</t3960> <t3961>This wasn't the first evidence he gave of being truly unaware of the actual conditions we lived in.</t3961>
<t3962>They will look, I said.</t3962> <t3963>They will look everywhere in our room.</t3963>
<t3964>Why? he asked.</t3964>
<t3965>I think I lost a bit of my control at that moment.</t3965> <t3966>Razor, I said.</t3966> <t3967>Books, writings, black market goods.</t3967> <t3968>Everything we shouldn't have.</t3968> <t3969>My God, you must know these things.</t3969> <t3970>My voice came out angrier than I wanted, but he didn't even flinch.</t3970>
<t3971>In that case, you will need to hide it here, he said.</t3971>
<t3972>That's exactly what I did.</t3972>
<t3973>She watched me apply the lotion to my hand and then to my face, with the same air of looking inside through iron bars.</t3973> <t3974>I felt like turning my back on her - as if she were in the bathroom with me - but I didn't dare.</t3974>
<t3975>I should not have forgotten that I was just a fleeting fancy for him.</t3975>
<t3976>26</t3976>
<t3977>Two or three weeks later, when the Night of the Ceremony came again, I saw that something had changed.</t3977> <t3978>There was a clumsiness that hadn't been there before.</t3978> <t3979>Previously, I treated it like a task, an unpleasant job that needed to be finished as quickly as possible, but only then could it be overcome.</t3979> <t3980>Steel yourself, my mother used to say, before exams I didn't want to take or swimming in cold water.</t3980> <t3981>Back then, I hadn't thought much about the meaning of this phrase, it was probably something related to metals, armors; well, that's what I did, I steeled myself.</t3981> <t3982>I pretended as if I wasn't there, as if I wasn't in my body.</t3982>
<t3983>This disappearance applied to the Commander existing separately from the body as well, I know this now.</t3983> <t3984>During all that time he was with me, he was probably always thinking about other things; with us, that is, because undoubtedly Serena Joy would also be there on those nights.</t3984> <t3985>He could have been thinking about what he did during the day, playing golf, or what he had for dinner.</t3985> <t3986>The sexual act, which he performed in a mechanical way, like scratching an itch, must have been largely unconscious for him.</t3986>
<t3987>But that night, whatever the name of this new arrangement between us - I couldn't put a name to it - on the first occasion after its inception, I felt ashamed of the Commander.</t3987> <t3988>In one way, I felt that he was really looking at me and I didn't like it.</t3988> <t3989>Because Serena Joy avoided anything that might create a romantic or erotic atmosphere, no matter how vague, the lights were on as usual: the strong ceiling lamps despite the canopy.</t3989> <t3990>It was like lying on an operating table under dazzling light; like being on stage.</t3990> <t3991>I was conscious of my hairy legs, once shaved but now grown back in a messy way; although he couldn't possibly see, I was also conscious of my armpits.</t3991> <t3992>I felt rough and coarse.</t3992> <t3993>While this mating, perhaps fertilization act, should mean no more than a bee to a flower, it had now become something inappropriate, against the customs, an embarrassing act for me, even though it hadn't been before.</t3993>
<t3994>The commander had ceased to be an inanimate object in my eyes.</t3994> <t3995>That was the problem.</t3995> <t3996>I realized this that night and it took root inside me.</t3996> <t3997>It became increasingly complicated.</t3997>
<t3998>Serena Joy had also changed for me.</t3998> <t3999>Because of her role in what was done to me, I used to only hate her; moreover, I hated her because she hated me and was disturbed by my presence, and because she would raise my child and, above all, have a child of her own.</t3999> <t4000>However, now, although I still hated her, it was no more than when she gripped my hand so tightly that her rings dug into my skin or when she clung to them in the same way; she must have been doing these things deliberately to disturb me as much as she could, my hatred was no longer pure and simple.</t4000> <t4001>Partly, I envied her; but how could I envy such an obviously exhausted and unhappy woman?</t4001> <t4002>One can only envy someone who has something they believe they should have themselves.</t4002> <t4003>Whatever it was, I envied her.</t4003>
<t4004>On the other hand, I also felt guilty.</t4004> <t4005>I felt like someone who had entered a space where they didn't belong.</t4005> <t4006>Even if it was just to play games and listen to him talk, because we were secretly meeting with the Commander, our functions were no longer as separate as they theoretically should have been.</t4006> <t4007>Even if he didn't know, I was taking something from him.</t4007> <t4008>Honestly, I was stealing.</t4008> <t4009>If I also took this mysterious "thing" that I couldn't fully define, which he definitely didn't want or need but still belonged to him - after all, the Commander wasn't in love with me, I refused to believe he felt something so extreme for me - what would be left for him?</t4009>
<t4010>Why should I care? I said to myself.</t4010> <t4011>It means nothing to me; she doesn't like me, if she found an excuse, she would throw me out of the house immediately or do something worse.</t4011> <t4012>If she were to catch us, for example.</t4012> <t4013>The Commander couldn't intervene to save me; whether it's Martha or a Handmaid, the crimes of the women in the house are considered subject only to the judgment of the Wives.</t4013> <t4014>She was a malicious and vindictive woman, I was aware of that.</t4014> <t4015>Still, I couldn't rid myself of this small pang of conscience I felt towards her.</t4015>
<t4016>Moreover: Even if he wasn't aware, I had now established a kind of dominance over him.</t4016> <t4017>And I was enjoying it.</t4017> <t4018>Why should I lie: I was immensely enjoying it.</t4018>
<t4019>But the Commander could easily give me away, with a glance, a gesture, a small mistake that could reveal to someone watching that there was something between us now.</t4019> <t4020>He almost did on the night of the ceremony.</t4020> <t4021>He raised his hand as if to touch my face; I turned my head to warn him, hoping Serena Joy wouldn't notice, and he withdrew his hand, returning to his single-minded journey.</t4021>
<t4022>Don't do this again, I said the next time we were alone.</t4022>
<t4023>What? he asked.</t4023>
<t4024>Don't try to touch me like that, while we are doing... while he is there.</t4024>
<t4025>Did I really do it? he said.</t4025>
<t4026>You could have caused me to be sent away, I said.</t4026> <t4027>To the colonies.</t4027> <t4028>You know this.</t4028> <t4029>Or it could have been worse.</t4029> <t4030>I thought he had to continue acting in front of others as if I were a large vase or a window; a part of the background, as if I were something inanimate or transparent.</t4030>
<t4031>I'm sorry, he said.</t4031> <t4032>I didn't do it on purpose.</t4032> <t4033>But this to me...</t4033>
<t4034>"What?" I said, when they didn't continue.</t4034>
<t4035>It feels like something devoid of emotion, he said.</t4035>
<t4036>How long did it take you to understand this? I asked.</t4036> <t4037>You can already see from the way I interact with him that our relationship has changed.</t4037>
<t4038>Aunt Lydia used to say, for future generations, everything will be much better.</t4038><t4039>Women will live together in harmony, everyone will be like a family; you will be like the ones left behind for them, when the population level rises again, you won't have to be sent from house to house anymore, because there will be enough to manage.</t4039><t4040>Under these conditions, she would say, winking as if she wanted to endear herself, real bonds of love can be established.</t4040><t4041>Women united for a common purpose!</t4041><t4042>Women helping each other in daily tasks, while each one fulfills the duty given to her, traversing the path of life shoulder to shoulder.</t4042><t4043>Why expect all the necessary functions for the proper management of household chores from a single woman?</t4043><t4044>This is neither rational nor humane.</t4044><t4045>You will have more freedom than your geese.</t4045><t4046>We are striving to achieve the goal of a small garden for each one of you -again clasped hands, that breathless voice- this is just one of our current goals.</t4046><t4047>That raised finger waving at us.</t4047><t4048>Well, we can't demand too much too soon like greedy pigs, can we?</t4048>
<t4049>The truth is, I am his mistress.</t4049> <t4050>Men at the top have always had mistresses, why should that change now?</t4050> <t4051>Okay, the arrangements aren't quite the same.</t4051> <t4052>In the past, mistresses were kept in a small house or in a separate apartment, but now they have glued everything together.</t4052> <t4053>However, fundamentally, both lead to the same outcome.</t4053> <t4054>One way or another.</t4054> <t4055>In some countries, they used to call them outside women.</t4055> <t4056>I am an outside woman.</t4056> <t4057>To provide things that would otherwise be missing, even Scrabble.</t4057> <t4058>It's a position as despicable as it is absurd.</t4058>
<t4059>Sometimes I think he knows.</t4059> <t4060>Sometimes I think they are in collusion.</t4060> <t4061>Sometimes, I imagine that Serena Joy pushed him into this and that he is mocking me; occasionally and mockingly, when I mock myself.</t4061> <t4062>He might be saying to himself, let her bear the burden.</t4062> <t4063>Almost, he might have completely withdrawn from her; maybe, this is his understanding of freedom.</t4063>
<t4064>But even so, foolishly, I am happier than I was before.</t4064> <t4065>In a way, it's something to do.</t4065> <t4066>Instead of sitting all alone in my room at night, it's something to pass the time.</t4066> <t4067>Another thing to think about.</t4067> <t4068>I neither love the Commander nor feel anything similar towards him; yet he is a source of interest for me, he occupies a place in space, no longer just a mere shadow.</t4068>
<t4069>I am like this for him too.</t4069> <t4070>I am no longer just a body to be used for him.</t4070> <t4071>A boat without a load, a glass without wine -to put it crudely- a pan without a pastry; I am no longer these things in his eyes.</t4071> <t4072>I am not just an empty thing for him anymore.</t4072>
<t4073>27</t4073>
<t4074>I am walking along Summer Street with Gleninki.</t4074> <t4075>The weather is hot and humid; it used to be summer-dress-and-sandal weather.</t4075> <t4076>We both have strawberries in our baskets and, since it's strawberry season, we'll eat until we burst, along with a few packaged fish.</t4076> <t4077>We got the fish from Bread and Fish, with a wooden sign featuring a smiling, eyelashed fish.</t4077> <t4078>Though they don't sell bread.</t4078> <t4079>If necessary, small, dry breads and wilted flatbreads can be bought from Daily Bread, but most households bake their own bread.</t4079> <t4080>Bread and Fish is rarely open.</t4080> <t4081>Why bother opening when there's nothing to sell?</t4081> <t4082>The fish fields disappeared years ago, and the few fish species that exist now come from farms and taste like mud.</t4082> <t4083>The news says the coastal areas are being "rested."</t4083> <t4084>I remember sole and haddock, swordfish, scallops, and tuna; stuffed or fried lobsters, pink and plump, fried in slices, my salmon.</t4084> <t4085>Could they all be extinct, like whales?</t4085> <t4086>While the picture of plump, boneless white meat in the window made our mouths water, I heard this rumor while standing in line outside the shop, waiting for it to open, almost motionless lips, silent words carried it to me.</t4086> <t4087>They put the picture in the window when they have something and take it down when it's sold out, sign language.</t4087>
<t4088>Gleninki and I are walking slowly today; we are suffocating under our long dresses, our armpits are wet, we are tired.</t4088> <t4089>At least we are not wearing gloves in this heat.</t4089> <t4090>There used to be an ice cream shop somewhere in this block.</t4090> <t4091>I can't remember its name.</t4091> <t4092>Everything can change very quickly, buildings can be demolished and turned into something else, it’s hard for a person to keep them in mind as they used to be.</t4092> <t4093>You could get two scoops of ice cream, and if you wanted, they would sprinkle chocolate pieces on top.</t4093> <t4094>They were named after a man, was it Johnnies?</t4094> <t4095>Jackies?</t4095> <t4096>I can't remember.</t4096>
<t4097>When my daughter was little, we used to go there, I would lift her up so she could see the ice cream tubs displayed behind the glass counter; they had quite elegant colors, pale orange, pale green, pale pink, I would read out their names so she could choose.</t4097> <t4098>However, she would choose based on the colors rather than the names.</t4098> <t4099>Her dresses and leggings were also in these colors.</t4099> <t4100>Ice cream pastels.</t4100>
<t4101>Jimmies, this was the name.</t4101>
<t4102>Gleninki and I are more comfortable together now, after all, we have gotten used to each other.</t4102> <t4103>Siamese twins.</t4103> <t4104>We no longer bother with formalities when greeting each other; we smile and set off straight ahead like horses lined up in a row.</t4104> <t4105>From time to time, we change our course; as long as we stay within the boundaries set by the barricades, there's no harm in it.</t4105> <t4106>As long as it stays within the labyrinth, a mouse is free to go wherever it wants.</t4106>
<t4107>We had already gone to the shops, and to the church; now we were by the Wall.</t4107> <t4108>There was nothing on it today, they didn't leave the bodies hanging as long as they did in winter because of the flies and the smell.</t4108> <t4109>This place was once the land of sprays.</t4109> <t4110>Pine and Floral, people still haven't forgotten the taste; especially the Commanders who always suggested purity in everything.</t4110>
<t4111>"Did you get everything on the list?" Gleninki asks now, though she knows I did.</t4111> <t4112>Our lists are never long.</t4112> <t4113>Lately, she had given up some of her passivity and melancholy.</t4113> <t4114>Most of the time, she is the one who speaks to me first.</t4114>
<t4115>"Yes," I say.</t4115>
<t4116>“Let's take a walk,” he says.</t4116> <t4117>He means the road going down to the river.</t4117> <t4118>We hadn't been there for a while.</t4118>
<t4119>“Good,” I say.</t4119> <t4120>Still, I don't immediately turn back and stay where I am, casting one last glance at the Wall.</t4120> <t4121>The red bricks are in place, as are the spotlights, barbed wires, and hooks.</t4121> <t4122>When it's empty like this, the Wall suggests more than ever that something bad is going to happen.</t4122> <t4123>When someone is hanging on it, at least you know what the worst is.</t4123> <t4124>But when it's empty, it also harbors possibilities, like an approaching storm.</t4124> <t4125>When I can see the bodies, the real bodies, and can guess from their sizes and shapes that none of them are Luke, I can also believe that he is still alive.</t4125>
<t4126>I don't know why I expected him to appear on this wall.</t4126> <t4127>There are hundreds of other places where they could have killed him.</t4127> <t4128>However, I can't shake the idea that right now, he is there, behind the empty, red bricks.</t4128>
<t4129>I am trying to imagine which building I am inside.</t4129> <t4130>I can remember the locations of the buildings on the other side of the Wall; when it was a university, we could roam freely there.</t4130> <t4131>We still go there occasionally, for the Women's Liberation Ceremony.</t4131> <t4132>Most of the buildings are made of red brick; some have arched entrances, a Roman influence from the nineteenth century.</t4132> <t4133>We are no longer allowed to enter the buildings; well, who would want to anyway?</t4133> <t4134>These buildings belong to the Eyes.</t4134>
<t4135>Maybe, Luke is in the library.</t4135> <t4136>Somewhere under the domes.</t4136> <t4137>Among the shelves.</t4137>
<t4138>The library is like a temple.</t4138> <t4139>There is a long, white staircase that leads to rows of doors.</t4139> <t4140>Then, inside, another white staircase that goes upwards.</t4140> <t4141>On either side, on the wall, there are angels.</t4141> <t4142>There are also men, fighting or about to fight, who appear clean and noble as they should, not dirty, blood-stained, and foul-smelling; on one side of the inner hall, Victory encourages them, while on the other side, Death is present.</t4142> <t4143>This is a mural made in honor of this or that war.</t4143> <t4144>The men on the side of Death are still alive.</t4144> <t4145>They are going to heaven.</t4145> <t4146>With wings and an almost bare chest, Death is a woman; or was it Victory?</t4146> <t4147>I can't remember.</t4147>
<t4148>They will not have destroyed this.</t4148>
<t4149>We turn our backs to the wall and head left.</t4149> <t4150>There are many empty shop windows here, their glass scribbled with soap.</t4150> <t4151>I try to remember what used to be sold there.</t4151> <t4152>Cosmetics?</t4152> <t4153>Or jewelry?</t4153> <t4154>Most of the shops that have something for men are still open; the ones that were closed dealt with what they called trivial matters.</t4154>
<t4155>There is a shop known as Prayer Cylinders on the corner.</t4155> <t4156>An agency: in every city center, in every suburb, there are Prayer Cylinders, at least that's what they say.</t4156> <t4157>They must be making a lot of profit.</t4157>
<t4158>The display windows of the Prayer Cylinders are of the unbreakable kind.</t4158> <t4159>Behind the glass, rows upon rows of printing machines; these machines are known as the Sacred Rollers, but only among us, producing prayers in endless rolls.</t4159> <t4160>They are ordered via the Compuphones, I had overheard the Commander's Wife doing it.</t4160> <t4161>Since ordering prayers from the Prayer Cylinders is considered a sign of piety and loyalty to the regime, the Commanders' Wives do this frequently, no doubt.</t4161> <t4162>It helps their husbands' careers.</t4162>
<t4163>There are five types of prayers: for health and prosperity, for a death, for a birth, and for sins.</t4163> <t4164>You choose the one you want and enter its number, then your own number so it can be deducted from your account, and finally the number of times you want the prayer to be repeated.</t4164>
<t4165>While the prayers are being printed, the machines speak; if you wish, you can go inside and listen to the toneless metallic voices repeating the same thing over and over again.</t4165> <t4166>When the reading and printing of the prayers are finished, the paper is rolled back through another slot and clean paper comes again.</t4166> <t4167>There are no people inside the building: the machines work on their own.</t4167> <t4168>You cannot hear their sounds from outside; just a murmur, a buzz, like a heap of a devout person kneeling.</t4168> <t4169>On the side of each machine, there are eyes painted in gold and supported by small golden wings on both sides.</t4169>
<t4170>Before it was turned into Dua Silindirleri, I try to remember what was sold here when it was a shop.</t4170> <t4171>I think it was a place that sold women's underwear.</t4171> <t4172>Pink and silver boxes, colorful pantyhose, lacy bras, silk scarves?</t4172> <t4173>Lost things.</t4173>
<t4174>Gleninki and I stand outside the Prayer Cylinders, looking through the unbreakable glass, watching the prayers extend far beyond the machines and then slip through the crack, disappearing into the realm of the unsaid.</t4174> <t4175>Suddenly, I shift my gaze.</t4175> <t4176>What I see is not the machines but Gleninki, reflected in the shop window.</t4176> <t4177>He is looking straight at me.</t4177>
<t4178>We can see directly into each other's eyes.</t4178> <t4179>This is the first time I'm seeing Gleninki's eyes directly, not from the side or fixed.</t4179> <t4180>Her face is oval, pink, plump but not fat, and her eyes are round.</t4180>
<t4181>Steadily, unchangingly, I hold my gaze on the glass.</t4181> <t4182>Now, looking elsewhere is difficult.</t4182> <t4183>There is something unsettling in this view; it's like seeing someone naked for the first time.</t4183> <t4184>Even though it never was before, now suddenly a risk has formed in the space between us.</t4184> <t4185>Even this meeting of gazes is fraught with danger.</t4185> <t4186>Even if there is no one around.</t4186>
<t4187>Finally, Gleninki speaks.</t4187> <t4188>"Do you think God is listening," he says, "to these machines?" He whispers: It's our habit at the Center.</t4188>
<t4189>In the past, this would have been considered a rather insignificant determination, a kind of verbal speculation.</t4189> <t4190>But now, it is treason.</t4190>
<t4191>I could have screamed.</t4191> <t4192>I could have run away.</t4192> <t4193>I could have slowly turned to the other side to explain that I would not tolerate such conversations around me.</t4193> <t4194>Malice, corruption, blasphemy, depravity, all had rolled into one.</t4194>
<t4195>I am steeling myself.</t4195> <t4196>"No," I say.</t4196>
<t4197>He lets out his breath, with a deep sigh of relief.</t4197> <t4198>We had crossed the invisible boundary together.</t4198> <t4199>“I think so too,” he says.</t4199>
<t4200>“Still, I guess it's a kind of faith,” I say.</t4200> <t4201>“Like Tibetan prayer wheels.</t4201><t4202>”</t4202>
<t4203>“What are those?” he asks.</t4203>
<t4204>“I had only read something about them,” I say.</t4204> <t4205>“They used to be turned by the wind.</t4205> <t4206>They are gone now.</t4206><t4207>”</t4207>
<t4208>“Like everything,” he says.</t4208> <t4209>But now we stop looking at each other.</t4209>
<t4210>“Is this place safe?” I whisper.</t4210> <t4211>“In my opinion, it's the safest place,” he says.</t4211> <t4212>“We look like we're praying, that's all.”</t4212> <t4213>“What about them?</t4213><t4214>”</t4214>
<t4215>“Them?” he says, still whispering.</t4215> <t4216>“Outside is always the safest place, there are no microphones, why would they put them here?</t4216> <t4217>They think no one would dare.</t4217> <t4218>But we've lingered long enough.</t4218> <t4219>There's no point in being late to return.”</t4219> <t4220>We turn back together.</t4220> <t4221>“Lower your head while walking,” he says, “and lean a bit towards me.</t4221> <t4222>That way I can hear you better.</t4222> <t4223>And don't talk if someone is coming.</t4223><t4224>”</t4224>
<t4225>Our heads bowed as usual, we are walking.</t4225> <t4226>I am so excited that I can barely breathe, yet I am still walking in a steady pace.</t4226> <t4227>Now, I must avoid drawing attention more than ever.</t4227>
<t4228>"I thought you were a true believer," says Gleninki.</t4228>
<t4229>“I am yours too,” I say.</t4229> <t4230>“You were always like a rotten bigot.</t4230><t4231>”</t4231>
<t4232>“You were like that too,” I reply.</t4232> <t4233>I want to laugh, shout, and hug him tightly.</t4233> <t4234>“You can join us,” he says.</t4234>
<t4235>"To us?" I say.</t4235> <t4236>So, there is an 'us' and there is a 'we'.</t4236> <t4237>I knew it.</t4237>
<t4238>"You didn't think I was the only one, did you?" he says.</t4238>
<t4239>I hadn't realized it.</t4239> <t4240>The thought that she is a spy, a trap set to ensnare me, crosses my mind; that's how the land we grew up in is.</t4240> <t4241>Still, I can't believe it; hope grows within me, like the essence of a tree.</t4241> <t4242>Like blood flowing from a wound.</t4242> <t4243>We had made an entrance.</t4243>
<t4244>I want to ask her if she has seen Moira, if she can find out what happened to Luke, my child, even my mother, but there is not enough time; we will soon reach the corner of the main street before the first barricade.</t4244> <t4245>There will be too many people.</t4245>
<t4246>“Don't say a single word,” warns Gleninki, though it's not necessary.</t4246> <t4247>“In any way.</t4247><t4248>”</t4248>
<t4249>"Of course, I won't tell," I say.</t4249> <t4250>Who could I tell anyway?</t4250>
<t4251>We walk along the main street, passing by Zambaklar and Bilumum Etler, without speaking.</t4251> <t4252>There are more people on the sidewalks this afternoon than usual; the warm weather must have brought them out.</t4252> <t4253>Women in green, blue, red, and striped dresses; and of course, men too, some in uniforms, some in plain civilian clothes.</t4253> <t4254>The sun is free, still there to be enjoyed.</t4254> <t4255>Yet, no one sunbathes anymore, at least not in plain sight.</t4255>
<t4256>The number of cars is also high, with Whirlwinds driven by their drivers and passengers buried in pillows, lower-level cars driven by lower-level men.</t4256>
<t4257>Something is happening: there is confusion and a rush among the car fleets.</t4257> <t4258>Some are pulling their cars to the side, as if wanting to avoid the road.</t4258> <t4259>I lift my head and quickly look: This is a black minibus with white-winged eyes on one side.</t4259> <t4260>The sirens are not on, but the other cars are also avoiding it.</t4260> <t4261>It is slowly moving along the street, as if searching for something: a shark waiting for an opportunity.</t4261>
<t4262>I'm freezing, the cold is coursing through me from head to toe.</t4262> <t4263>So there were microphones, they heard us after all.</t4263>
<t4264>Glenbki, squeezing my elbow from under the sleeve of the dress.</t4264> <t4265>"Keep walking," he whispers.</t4265> <t4266>"Act like you didn't see it.</t4266><t4267>"</t4267>
<t4268>But I can't do it without seeing.</t4268><t4269>The minibus is standing right in front of us.</t4269><t4270>Two Eyes in gray suits jump down from the double doors that open at the back.</t4270><t4271>They grab an ordinary-looking man with a briefcase walking on the road and pin him against the black side of the minibus.</t4271><t4272>The man hangs there for a moment, spreading out as if stuck to the metal; then one of the Eyes goes towards him, makes a sharp and painful move, and the man folds in half like a soft roll of fabric.</t4272><t4273>They lift him up and throw him into the back of the minibus like a haphazardly packed parcel.</t4273><t4274>Then they also get in, the doors close, and the minibus moves.</t4274>
<t4275>Everything ends in a few seconds, and the traffic on the street returns to its normal flow as if nothing had happened.</t4275>
<t4276>What I felt was relief.</t4276> <t4277>I wasn't the one being sought.</t4277>
<t4278>28</t4278>
<t4279>I don't feel like taking a nap this afternoon, there's still too much adrenaline in my blood.</t4279> <t4280>I'm sitting on the windowsill, looking outside through the semi-transparency of the curtains.</t4280> <t4281>White nightgown.</t4281> <t4282>The window is as open as it can be, there's a warm breeze under the sunlight, and the white curtain is billowing towards my face.</t4282> <t4283>From outside, I must look like a cocoon, a ghost; a face covered like this, only the outlines visible, nose, bandaged mouth, empty eyes.</t4283> <t4284>Despite this, I enjoy the sensation, the soft fabric brushing against my face.</t4284> <t4285>It's like being inside a cloud.</t4285>
<t4286>They gave me a small electric fan, which helps in this humid weather.</t4286> <t4287>In the corner, its blades placed inside a cage, it keeps turning on the floor.</t4287> <t4288>If I were Moira, I would know how to open it, how to expose its cutting edges.</t4288> <t4289>I don't have a screwdriver, but if I were Moira, I could manage this job without one.</t4289> <t4290>I am not Moira.</t4290>
<t4291>If she were here, I wonder what she would say about the Commander?</t4291> <t4292>Probably, she wouldn't approve.</t4292> <t4293>In the past, she didn't approve of Luke either.</t4293> <t4294>Not because of Luke himself, but because of the fact that he was married.</t4294> <t4295>She would say I was poaching in another woman's territory.</t4295> <t4296>I would say that Luke was not a fish or a piece of land, but a human being, and therefore could make his own decisions.</t4296> <t4297>She would argue that I was rationalizing the situation.</t4297> <t4298>I would say that I loved him.</t4298> <t4299>She would say that wasn't an excuse.</t4299> <t4300>Moira was always more rational than I was.</t4300>
<t4301>Since he decided to choose women, he no longer had such a problem, and as far as I could see, he never hesitated to steal or borrow those women whenever he felt like it.</t4301> <t4302>He would explain that this was different because the balance of power among women was equal, thus turning sex into a give-and-take exchange.</t4302> <t4303>However, I would argue that "give-and-take" is a sexist expression, and if it were to be like this, the discussion would be invalid from the start.</t4303> <t4304>He would say that I was trivializing the issue and that if I thought it was invalid, I was living with my head buried in the sand.</t4304>
<t4305>We would say all of this to each other in those low and intense tones we used for such discussions while drinking our coffees and sitting at my kitchen table, a tradition we had maintained since college, when we were in our early twenties.</t4305> <t4306>The kitchen was in an apartment of a building near the river, with a wooden exterior, three rooms on each floor, and a rickety back staircase.</t4306> <t4307>I was on the second floor, which meant I was exposed to noise from both above and below, with two unwanted stereo players blaring until the middle of the night.</t4307> <t4308>I knew they were students.</t4308> <t4309>I was still working at my first job, which didn't bring in much income: I was working with computers at an insurance company.</t4309> <t4310>That's why my hotel meetings with Luke didn't just mean love or just sex to me.</t4310> <t4311>These meetings also meant an escape from cockroaches, dripping sinks, linoleum peeling off in strips, and even my attempts to liven up the place by sticking posters on the walls and hanging prisms on the windows.</t4311> <t4312>I also had flowers; however, they would either get infested with spider mites or dry up when not watered.</t4312> <t4313>I would go out with Luke and neglect them.</t4313>
<t4314>If she thinks that there are multiple ways to live with her head buried in the sand and that she can create a utopia by closing herself off to a world exclusive to women, I would tell Moira that she is gravely mistaken.</t4314> <t4315>I would say that men don't just up and leave like that.</t4315> <t4316>You can't remain indifferent to them.</t4316>
<t4317>This was like saying "Get syphilis because there's such a thing as syphilis," Moira would say.</t4317>
<t4318>Are you suggesting that Luke is a social epidemic? I would ask.</t4318>
<t4319>She would laugh.</t4319> <t4320>Moira.</t4320> <t4321>Look at what we're talking about, she would say.</t4321> <t4322>I'll mess it up.</t4322> <t4323>We turned into your mother.</t4323>
<t4324>We would both laugh at this, and as always, we would hug each other when parting.</t4324> <t4325>There was a period when we didn't hug after he told me he was gay; however, later he assured me that I didn't turn him on, and we started hugging again.</t4325> <t4326>We could fight, argue, and call each other bad names, but fundamentally, it didn't change anything.</t4326> <t4327>He was still my best friend.</t4327>
<t4328>It's the same now.</t4328>
<t4329>After that, during the two years I spent looking for ways to get rid of Luke's wife, I moved to a better apartment.</t4329> <t4330>I was paying the rent myself, with my new job.</t4330> <t4331>My job was in a library, not the big one with Death and Glory, but a smaller one.</t4331>
<t4332>I was transferring books to computer disks; they said it was to reduce storage and renewal costs.</t4332> <t4333>We called ourselves diskers.</t4333> <t4334>We had nicknamed the library "diskotheque," it was a joke among us.</t4334> <t4335>After being transferred to disks, the books had to go to the shredder, but sometimes I would take them home.</t4335> <t4336>I enjoyed touching them and their appearance.</t4336> <t4337>Luke said I had the mind of an antiquarian.</t4337> <t4338>He liked that, he also loved old things.</t4338>
<t4339>Thinking about having a job feels strange to me now.</t4339> <t4340>Job.</t4340> <t4341>It's a funny word.</t4341> <t4342>Job, it's for men now.</t4342> <t4343>Do a job, they used to tell children, during toilet training.</t4343> <t4344>Or for dogs: he did his business on the carpet.</t4344> <t4345>You have to hit them with a newspaper roll, my mom used to say.</t4345> <t4346>I can remember the times when newspapers were around, although I never had a dog, only cats.</t4346>
<t4347>The Book of Job.</t4347> <t4348>13</t4348>
<t4349>The fact that all those women had jobs: it's hard to believe now, but thousands of them had jobs back then, millions of them.</t4349> <t4350>It was considered a normal thing.</t4350> <t4351>Now, it's like remembering the paper money from the times when they still existed.</t4351> <t4352>My mother had saved some by sticking them in her album along with old photographs.</t4352> <t4353>By that time, they had been taken out of circulation, you couldn't buy anything with them.</t4353> <t4354>Thick pieces of paper, giving an oily feeling when touched, green in color, with pictures on both sides, some of old men in wigs and on the other side a pyramid with an eye on it.</t4354> <t4355>In God We Trust was written on it.</t4355> <t4356>My mother used to say that people kept signs next to their cash registers as a joke: In God We Trust.</t4356> <t4357>Everyone Else Pays Cash.</t4357>
<t4358>This would be blasphemy now.</t4358>
<t4359>You had to take these pieces of paper with you when you went shopping, although by the time I was nine or ten, most people used plastic cards.</t4359> <t4360>Still, the cards weren't accepted at the grocery store; that came later.</t4360> <t4361>It seems so primitive, almost like totemism, just like kauri.</t4361> <t4362>I must have used this kind of money a little myself, before everything went into the Compubank.</t4362>
<t4363>I think the reason they could do this all of a sudden without anyone understanding beforehand was those cards.</t4363> <t4364>If there were still cash, it would have been harder for them to do this.</t4364>
<t4365>It was after the disaster, after the President was shot and killed, after Congress was gunned down with a machine gun, and after the army declared martial law, that is.</t4365> <t4366>At that time, they blamed Muslim fanatics.</t4366> <t4367>Stay calm, they said on television.</t4367> <t4368>Everything is under control.</t4368> <t4369>I was shocked.</t4369> <t4370>Everyone was, I know that.</t4370> <t4371>It was hard to believe.</t4371> <t4372>The entire government had been wiped out in this way.</t4372> <t4373>How had they gotten in, how had this happened?</t4373>
<t4374>It was when they suspended the Constitution.</t4374> <t4375>They said it would be temporary.</t4375> <t4376>There wasn't even any uprising in the streets.</t4376> <t4377>People were sitting at home in the evenings, watching television and looking for some direction.</t4377> <t4378>There wasn't even an enemy you could point your finger at.</t4378>
<t4379>Be careful, Moira said to me on the phone.</t4379> <t4380>Here it comes.</t4380>
<t4381>What is coming, I said.</t4381>
<t4382>Wait, he said.</t4382> <t4383>Step by step, they are heading towards this outcome.</t4383> <t4384>Now we've hit the wall, you and me, baby.</t4384> <t4385>He was quoting something his mother used to say, but he wasn't trying to be funny.</t4385>
<t4386>Things went on for weeks without the slightest sign of life, although there were a few incidents here and there.</t4386> <t4387>The newspapers were censored and a few were shut down, they said for security reasons.</t4387> <t4388>Barricades began to be seen, as well as Identity Cards.</t4388> <t4389>Everyone approved of this, because it was clear that you couldn't be too careful.</t4389> <t4390>They said that new elections would be held, but that time was needed to prepare for them.</t4390> <t4391>The thing to do, they said, was to carry on as usual.</t4391>
<t4392>The porn shops were closed, and there were no more Feels on Wheels vans or Bun Dle Buggies cruising around the Square.</t4392> <t4393>But seeing them go didn't upset me.</t4393> <t4394>We all knew what a nuisance they were.</t4394>
<t4395>It's high time someone did something, said the woman behind the counter at the shop where I usually buy cigarettes.</t4395> <t4396>It was on the corner, a newsstand: newspapers, candies, cigarettes.</t4396> <t4397>The woman was elderly and gray-haired, of my mother's generation.</t4397>
<t4398>Did they just close them off, or did they do something else? I asked.</t4398>
<t4399>Shrugged shoulders.</t4399> <t4400>Who knows, who cares, he said.</t4400> <t4401>Maybe they moved them somewhere else.</t4401> <t4402>Trying to get rid of them completely is like trying to exterminate all the rats.</t4402> <t4403>He entered my account number into the register, barely looking: I was a regular customer back then.</t4403> <t4404>People were complaining about them, he said.</t4404>
<t4405>On the next morning, while heading to the library to study, I stopped by the same shop to buy another pack of cigarettes because I had run out.</t4405> <t4406>In those days, I was smoking more, the reason was tension, you could feel it, like a hum coming from underground, even though everything seemed very calm.</t4406> <t4407>I was also drinking more coffee and having trouble sleeping.</t4407> <t4408>Everyone was a bit suspicious.</t4408> <t4409>There was generally more music on the radio and less talk than usual.</t4409>
<t4410>It was after we got married, it felt like we had been married for years; the girl was three or four years old, she was going to kindergarten.</t4410>
<t4411>We all got up as usual and had breakfast, I remember there was granola, then Luke took him to school; he was wearing the striped overalls and blue t-shirt I had bought just a few weeks ago.</t4411> <t4412>What month was it?</t4412> <t4413>It must have been September.</t4413> <t4414>There was a School Bus to pick them up, but for some reason, I wanted Luke to do it, I had even started to worry about the School Bus.</t4414> <t4415>There were no more children walking to school, too many children had gone missing.</t4415>
<t4416>When I arrived at the corner shop, the usual woman wasn't there.</t4416> <t4417>Instead, there was a man, a young man, who couldn't have been more than twenty.</t4417>
<t4418>"Is he/she sick?" I said, as I handed him/her my card.</t4418>
<t4419>"Who?" he said, his demeanor seemed aggressive to me.</t4419>
<t4420>The woman who is always here, I said.</t4420>
<t4421>How would I know, he said.</t4421> <t4422>He was entering my number, looking at each digit and pressing the keys with one finger.</t4422> <t4423>It was clear that he hadn't done this before.</t4423> <t4424>I was tapping my fingers on the counter, impatient to buy cigarettes, wondering if anyone had ever told him that something could be done about those pimples on his neck.</t4424> <t4425>I remember very well how he looked: tall, slightly hunched, short dark hair, brown eyes that seemed to focus five centimeters behind the bridge of my nose, and those teenage pimples.</t4425> <t4426>The reason I remember him so well must be because of what he said later.</t4426>
<t4427>I'm sorry, he said.</t4427> <t4428>This number is not valid.</t4428>
<t4429>Absurd, I said.</t4429> <t4430>It should be valid, I have thousands of dollars in my account.</t4430> <t4431>I received the account report just two days ago.</t4431> <t4432>Try again.</t4432>
<t4433>Invalid, he repeated stubbornly.</t4433> <t4434>Do you see that red light?</t4434> <t4435>It means invalid.</t4435>
<t4436>You must have made a mistake, I said.</t4436> <t4437>Try again.</t4437>
<t4438>He shrugged and smiled wearily, yet he tried the number again.</t4438> <t4439>This time, I watched his fingers carefully, checking each digit and the numbers displayed on the screen.</t4439> <t4440>Yes, it was my number, but the red light was still there.</t4440>
<t4441>"Did you see?" he said again, still with that smile, as if he were about to tell me a special joke that he wouldn't share with anyone else.</t4441>
<t4442>I said, "I will call them from the office."</t4442> <t4443>The system had been messed up before as well, but a few phone calls usually resolved the issue.</t4443> <t4444>I was still angry, as if I had been unfairly accused of something I had no idea about.</t4444> <t4445>As if I had made the mistake myself.</t4445>
<t4446>Do it, he said indifferently.</t4446> <t4447>I left the cigarettes on the counter, after all, I hadn't paid for them.</t4447> <t4448>I thought, I can borrow a few at work.</t4448>
<t4449>I called from the office, but all I got was a recorded message.</t4449> <t4450>The lines are overloaded, said the recorded message.</t4450> <t4451>Could I please call again?</t4451>
<t4452>As far as I know, the lines were busy throughout the morning.</t4452> <t4453>I called a few more times, but I had no luck.</t4453> <t4454>Even this was not very unusual.</t4454>
<t4455>After lunch, around two o'clock, the manager came to the disking room.</t4455>
<t4456>I have things to tell you, he said.</t4456> <t4457>He looked terrible; his hair was disheveled, his eyes were red, and he was swaying as if he were drunk.</t4457>
<t4458>We all lifted our heads and turned off the machines.</t4458> <t4459>There must have been eight or ten people in the room.</t4459>
<t4460>I'm sorry, he said, but that's the law.</t4460> <t4461>I'm really sorry.</t4461>
<t4462>For what? said one.</t4462>
<t4463>I have to send you away, he said.</t4463> <t4464>It's the law, I have no choice.</t4464> <t4465>I have to send all of you away.</t4465> <t4466>He was saying this almost with compassion, as if we were wild animals, frogs he had caught and put in a jar, and he was treating us humanely.</t4466>
<t4467>"Are we being thrown out?" I said.</t4467> <t4468>I stood up.</t4468> <t4469>"But why?"</t4469>
<t4470>You're not being fired, he said.</t4470> <t4471>You're being sent away.</t4471> <t4472>You won't work here anymore.</t4472> <t4473>That's the law.</t4473> <t4474>He ran his hands through his hair, he's gone mad, I thought.</t4474> <t4475>The tension was too much for him and he lost it.</t4475>
<t4476>You can't just do that, said the woman sitting next to me.</t4476> <t4477>This sounded both absurd and unexpected, like something that would be said on television.</t4477>
<t4478>I'm not doing it, said the manager.</t4478> <t4479>You don't understand.</t4479> <t4480>Please leave, now.</t4480> <t4481>His voice was rising.</t4481> <t4482>I don't want any trouble.</t4482> <t4483>If trouble arises, the books might disappear, things will go wrong...</t4483> <t4484>He looked back over his shoulder.</t4484> <t4485>They're outside, he said, in my office.</t4485> <t4486>If you don't go in now, they will come in themselves.</t4486> <t4487>They gave me ten minutes.</t4487> <t4488>He now looked more frantic than ever.</t4488>
<t4489>"He's gone mad," said one loudly, "we must all have thought so."</t4489>
<t4490>However, I could see the corridor and there were two men standing there, in uniform, with machine guns.</t4490> <t4491>It was too theatrical to be real, yet there they were: ghosts that suddenly appeared, like Martians.</t4491> <t4492>They had a dreamlike quality; overly vivid, overly out of place with their surroundings.</t4492>
<t4493>Leave the machines, said the manager as we gathered our belongings and exited one by one.</t4493> <t4494>As if we could take them with us.</t4494>
<t4495>We gathered on the steps outside the library.</t4495> <t4496>We didn't know we could say anything to each other.</t4496> <t4497>Since none of us understood what was happening, there wasn't much we could say.</t4497> <t4498>We looked at each other's faces, saw the fear, the obvious shame, as if we had been caught doing something we shouldn't have been doing.</t4498>
<t4499>"This is a disgrace," said one of the women, not really believing it.</t4499> <t4500>"I wonder what made us believe we deserved this?"</t4500>
<t4501>When I returned home, there was no one there.</t4501> <t4502>Luke was still at work, my daughter was at school.</t4502> <t4503>I felt tired, tired to my bones, but as soon as I sat down, I got up again, I couldn't stay still.</t4503> <t4504>I wandered around the house, moving from room to room.</t4504> <t4505>I remember touching things, not very consciously, just brushing my fingers over them, like the toaster, the sugar bowl, the ashtray in the living room.</t4505> <t4506>After a while, I picked up the cat and carried it around with me.</t4506> <t4507>I wanted Luke to come home.</t4507> <t4508>I thought I needed to do something, to take some steps; but I didn't know what steps to take.</t4508>
<t4509>I tried calling the bank again, but I could only hear the same recording.</t4509> <t4510>I poured myself a glass of milk - I told myself I was too nervous for another coffee - and went to the living room, sat on the couch, and placed the glass of milk on the coffee table, carefully, without taking a single sip.</t4510> <t4511>I pressed the cat to my chest, so I could feel its purring in my throat.</t4511>
<t4512>After a while, I called my mother from her house, but there was no answer.</t4512> <t4513>At that time, she was more settled, having given up moving every few years; she was living in Boston, across the river.</t4513> <t4514>I waited a bit and called Moira.</t4514> <t4515>She wasn't home either, but when I called again half an hour later, she was home.</t4515> <t4516>During the time between these calls, I just sat on the couch.</t4516> <t4517>What I was thinking about was my daughter's school lunches.</t4517> <t4518>I was wondering if maybe I had given her too many peanut butter sandwiches.</t4518>
<t4519>I got fired, I said to Moira when I caught her on the phone.</t4519> <t4520>She said she would come.</t4520> <t4521>At that time, she was working in the publishing department of a women's union.</t4521> <t4522>They were publishing books about birth control, rape, and similar topics, although there wasn't as much demand for such things as there used to be.</t4522>
<t4523>I'm coming, he said.</t4523> <t4524>He must have understood from my voice that this is what I wanted.</t4524>
<t4525>He arrived after a while.</t4525> <t4526>Here, he said.</t4526> <t4527>He took off his jacket and threw it, sprawling on the big armchair.</t4527> <t4528>Tell me.</t4528> <t4529>First, let's pour ourselves a glass of drink.</t4529>
<t4530>He got up, went to the kitchen, poured us a double Scotch, came back, sat down, and I tried to tell him what had happened to me.</t4530> <t4531>When I finished, he said, "Did you try to buy something with your Compucard today?"</t4531>
<t4532>Yes, I said.</t4532> <t4533>I also explained this to him/her.</t4533>
<t4534>They froze them, he said.</t4534> <t4535>Mine too.</t4535> <t4536>The union's too.</t4536> <t4537>If not, then each of the K-coded accounts.</t4537> <t4538>All they had to do was press a few buttons.</t4538> <t4539>Our book was closed.</t4539>
<t4540>I have more than two thousand dollars in the bank, I said, as if the only thing that mattered was my account.</t4540>
<t4541>Women can no longer acquire wealth, she said.</t4541> <t4542>The new law is like this.</t4542> <t4543>Did you turn on the TV today at all?</t4543>
<t4544>No, I said.</t4544>
<t4545>They say it there, he said.</t4545> <t4546>Everywhere.</t4546> <t4547>He wasn't as bewildered as I was.</t4547> <t4548>He was strangely cheerful, as if it was something he had been expecting for a while and now he had been proven right.</t4548> <t4549>He even seemed more energetic, more determined.</t4549> <t4550>Luke can use the Compubank for you, he said.</t4550> <t4551>They will transfer your number to his or so they say.</t4551> <t4552>To your husband's or your nearest male relative's.</t4552>
<t4553>But what about you? I asked.</t4553> <t4554>He had no one.</t4554>
<t4555>"I will go underground," he said.</t4555> <t4556>"One of the Homos can take over our accounts and buy the things we need."</t4556>
<t4557>But why? I asked.</t4557> <t4558>Why did they do it?</t4558>
<t4559>Our job is not to understand the reason, said Moira.</t4559> <t4560>They had to handle it this way, the Compucalculations and the tasks, both at once.</t4560> <t4561>Can you imagine the airports otherwise?</t4561> <t4562>They don't want us to go anywhere, you can be sure of that.</t4562>
<t4563>I went to pick up my daughter from school.</t4563> <t4564>I drove the car with exaggerated caution.</t4564> <t4565>When Luke came home, I was sitting at the kitchen table.</t4565> <t4566>My daughter was drawing pictures with her felt-tip pens at her own little table in the corner where her pictures were stuck next to the refrigerator.</t4566>
<t4567>Luke knelt beside me and wrapped his arms around me.</t4567> <t4568>I heard it on the car radio on the way home, he said.</t4568> <t4569>Don't worry, I'm sure it's temporary.</t4569>
<t4570>Did they say the reason? I asked.</t4570>
<t4571>Did not respond.</t4571> <t4572>We will get through this, he said, hugging me.</t4572>
<t4573>You don't know what this feels like, I said.</t4573> <t4574>I feel as if someone has cut off my feet.</t4574> <t4575>I wasn't crying.</t4575>
<t4576>On the other hand, it's a job, he said, trying to calm me down.</t4576>
<t4577>I guess you're going to take all my money, I said.</t4577> <t4578>I'm not even dead yet.</t4578> <t4579>I was trying to make a joke, but my voice came out terribly.</t4579>
<t4580>Stop, I said.</t4580> <t4581>He was still kneeling on the ground.</t4581> <t4582>You think I will always look after you.</t4582>
<t4583>He has already started to act superior to me, I thought.</t4583> <t4584>Immediately after, I thought, you are already starting to become paranoid.</t4584>
<t4585>I know, I said.</t4585> <t4586>I love you.</t4586>
<t4587>Later, after the girl went to bed and we had dinner, I didn't feel so shaken, and I told her what happened in the afternoon.</t4587> <t4588>I described the manager's entrance and his sudden explanation.</t4588> <t4589>If it weren't so terrifying, it would have been ridiculous, I said.</t4589> <t4590>I thought he was drunk.</t4590> <t4591>Maybe he was.</t4591> <t4592>The army and everyone else were there.</t4592>
<t4593>Then I remembered something I had seen around that time but hadn't paid attention to.</t4593> <t4594>It wasn't the army as we know it.</t4594> <t4595>It was a different kind of army.</t4595>
<t4596>There were marches, of course, a bunch of women and a few men.</t4596> <t4597>However, their numbers were fewer than you might think.</t4597> <t4598>I think people were scared.</t4598> <t4599>When it was heard that the police or the army or whoever would open fire as soon as the marches began, the marches stopped.</t4599> <t4600>A few bombs were set off, post offices, subway stations.</t4600> <t4601>But you couldn't even be sure who did it.</t4601> <t4602>It could have been the army, to justify their computer and house-to-house searches.</t4602>
<t4603>I did not join any of the marches.</t4603> <t4604>Luke said it would be in vain and that I should think about them, my family, him, and my daughter.</t4604> <t4605>So I thought about my family.</t4605> <t4606>I started doing more housework, cooking more meals.</t4606> <t4607>I tried not to cry during meal times.</t4607> <t4608>At that time, I had started crying for no reason and sitting at the bedroom window looking outside.</t4608> <t4609>I didn't know many of the neighbors, and when we met on the street, we made an effort not to talk much beyond the usual greetings.</t4609> <t4610>Nobody wanted to be reported on the grounds of betrayal.</t4610>
<t4611>As I remember this, I also remember my mother, years ago.</t4611> <t4612>I must have been fourteen or fifteen, at the age when girls are most annoyed by their mothers.</t4612> <t4613>I remember her coming to one of our constantly changing houses with a group of other women, part of her constantly changing circle of friends.</t4613> <t4614>That day, they had participated in a march; it was the time of anti-pornography uprisings, or was it the abortion uprisings, they were so close to each other.</t4614> <t4615>There had been many bombings at that time: clinics, video stores; it was hard to keep track.</t4615>
<t4616>There was a bruise and a bit of blood on my mother's face.</t4616> <t4617>Those who went to the bathhouse were sweating, that's all he said.</t4617> <t4618>Damned pigs.</t4618>
<t4619>Damn bleeders, said one of his friends.</t4619> <t4620>They called the other side bleeders, according to the slogans they carried: Let them bleed.</t4620> <t4621>So, there must have been abortion uprisings.</t4621>
<t4622>I went to my bedroom to stay out of the way.</t4622> <t4623>They were talking too much and too loudly.</t4623> <t4624>They were ignoring me, and I was resenting them for it.</t4624> <t4625>My mom and her thug friends.</t4625> <t4626>I didn't understand why she had to dress like that, as if she were young, walking around in overalls; or why she had to swear so much.</t4626>
<t4627>"But you are pretending to be virtuous," she would say to me, usually in a pleased tone of voice.</t4627> <t4628>She enjoyed being more unconventional, more rebellious than I was.</t4628> <t4629>Young people always pretend to be virtuous like this.</t4629>
<t4630>I am sure part of my opposition was based on this: indifference, routine.</t4630> <t4631>Moreover, I wanted a life that was more ceremonial, less dependent on temporary measures and escapes than his.</t4631>
<t4632>You were a wanted child, God knows, she would say at other times, while lingering on the pages of the photo albums she framed me in; these albums were swollen with baby pictures, but as I grew older, my images dwindled, as if their number had been decimated by some kind of epidemic.</t4632> <t4633>She would say this with a bit of sadness, as if I hadn't turned out exactly as she had expected.</t4633> <t4634>No mother fully matches the idea of a mother that a child has, and I suppose the reverse is also true.</t4634> <t4635>But despite everything, we were not bad with each other.</t4635> <t4636>We were like most people.</t4636>
<t4637>I wish he were here so that I could finally tell him that I understand this.</t4637>
<t4638>Someone came out of the house.</t4638> <t4639>From afar, I hear a door closing, footsteps on the walkway somewhere to the side.</t4639> <t4640>It's Nick, now I can see him; he stepped off the path onto the grass, inhaling the moist air thick with the scent of flowers, lush growth, and handfuls of pollen thrown into the wind like oysters spilling into the sea.</t4640> <t4641>Always this extravagant reproduction.</t4641> <t4642>Nick stretches in the sun, I can feel his muscles rippling along his body, just like a cat's arched back.</t4642> <t4643>He's wearing a shirt, his bare arms shamelessly emerging from the rolled-up fabric.</t4643> <t4644>I wonder where the bronze of his skin ends?</t4644> <t4645>I haven't spoken to him since that night, since the dreamlike scene in the living room filled with moonlight.</t4645> <t4646>He's just my flag, my semaphore.</t4646> <t4647>Body language.</t4647>
<t4648>The cap is tilted to the side right now.</t4648> <t4649>That means I'm being summoned.</t4649>
<t4650>What does the errand boy get in return for his role?</t4650> <t4651>How does he feel while ambiguously pimping for the Commander?</t4651> <t4652>Does it fill him with disgust, or does it make him want me more?</t4652> <t4653>Because there, among the books, he has no idea what's really going on.</t4653> <t4654>Perverse actions, considering how little he knows.</t4654> <t4655>The Commander and I, covering each other in ink, then licking it off or making love on piles of forbidden newspapers.</t4655> <t4656>Well, he wasn't entirely wrong about that.</t4656>
<t4657>But believe this, there is something in this relationship for him too.</t4657> <t4658>In one way or another, everyone has a price.</t4658> <t4659>Is he buying extra cigarettes?</t4659> <t4660>Extra freedoms that are not given to the majority?</t4660> <t4661>Whatever, what can he prove?</t4661> <t4662>His word against the Commander's, unless he brings a police squad with him.</t4662> <t4663>Kick the door, here's what I told you?</t4663> <t4664>They were caught red-handed, playing Scrabble sinfully.</t4664> <t4665>Quickly, eat those words.</t4665>
<t4666>Maybe he just enjoys the satisfaction of knowing a secret.</t4666> <t4667>Having leverage against me, as they used to say.</t4667> <t4668>This is the kind of power that can only be used once.</t4668>
<t4669>I would like to think better of him.</t4669>
<t4670>That night, after I lost my job, Luke wanted to make love to me.</t4670> <t4671>I wondered why I didn't want to?</t4671> <t4672>Despair alone should have ignited me.</t4672> <t4673>But I still felt numb.</t4673> <t4674>I could barely feel his hands on me.</t4674>
<t4675>What is the problem? he said.</t4675>
<t4676>I don't know, I said.</t4676>
<t4677>"We still have something..." he said.</t4677> <t4678>But he didn't say what it was that we still had.</t4678> <t4679>I thought he shouldn't say "we," because nothing I knew of had been taken from him.</t4679>
<t4680>We still have each other, I said.</t4680> <t4681>This was true.</t4681> <t4682>So why did my voice sound so indifferent, even to myself?</t4682>
<t4683>And he kissed me, as if by saying this now, things could return to normal.</t4683> <t4684>But something had changed, a balance.</t4684> <t4685>I felt shrunken, so much so that when he wrapped his arms around me, I was as small as a baby.</t4685> <t4686>I felt that love was progressing without me.</t4686>
<t4687>He doesn't care, I thought.</t4687> <t4688>He doesn't care at all, even.</t4688> <t4689>Maybe he even likes it.</t4689> <t4690>We don't belong to each other anymore.</t4690> <t4691>Instead, I belong to myself.</t4691>
<t4692>Worthless, unjust, unreal.</t4692> <t4693>But this is what happened.</t4693>
<t4694>Yes Luke: Now, what I want to ask you, what I need to know: Was I right?</t4694> <t4695>Because we never talked about this.</t4695> <t4696>When I had the chance to do it, I was scared.</t4696> <t4697>I couldn't risk losing you.</t4697>
<t4698>29</t4698>
<t4699>I'm sitting in the Commander's room, across from his desk, in the position of a customer, as if I were a bank customer discussing a substantial loan.</t4699> <t4700>However, aside from my placement in the room, there is little formality left between us.</t4700> <t4701>I'm no longer sitting with my neck and back straight, feet placed side by side on the floor, with respectful glances.</t4701> <t4702>Instead, my body is relaxed, almost comfortable.</t4702> <t4703>I've taken off my red shoes, tucked my legs under me on the couch, though they are still surrounded by the red skirt, but they are under me nonetheless, as if I were around a campfire from previous picnic days.</t4703> <t4704>If there were a fire in the fireplace, its light would glimmer on the polished surfaces and warmly shine on the skin.</t4704> <t4705>I'm adding the firelight myself.</t4705>
<t4706>As for the Commander, he is extremely relaxed tonight.</t4706> <t4707>He has taken off his jacket and is resting his elbows on the table.</t4707> <t4708>Like a figure in a metal mold, the only thing missing to be a rural democracy advertisement is a toothpick between his lips.</t4708> <t4709>An old, burnt book covered in fly specks.</t4709>
<t4710>The squares on the board in front of me began to fill up: I'm playing the penultimate game of the night.</t4710> <t4711>I'm writing Zilch14, a high-scoring single-syllable word with a "Z".</t4711>
<t4712>“Is this a word?” says the Commander.</t4712>
<t4713>“We can look it up in the dictionary,” I say.</t4713> <t4714>“Archaic.</t4714><t4715>”</t4715>
<t4716>“It's yours,” he says.</t4716> <t4717>He smiles.</t4717> <t4718>When I show eager developments and stand out like a pet with its ears pricked up and eager to perform tricks, the Commander likes it.</t4718> <t4719>His approval envelops me like a warm bath.</t4719> <t4720>I don't sense a trace of the hostility I used to sense in men, even occasionally in Luke.</t4720> <t4721>He doesn't think of me as a whore.</t4721> <t4722>In fact, he is positively fatherly.</t4722> <t4723>He likes to think that I amuse him; and yes, I am amusing, I am amusing.</t4723>
<t4724>He skillfully tallies our final scores on the pocket computer.</t4724> <t4725>"You've gone off on your own," he says.</t4725> <t4726>I suspect he is cheating to flatter and cheer me up.</t4726> <t4727>But why?</t4727> <t4728>This remains a question.</t4728> <t4729>What will he gain from this flattery?</t4729> <t4730>There must be something.</t4730>
<t4731>He leans back, fingertips together, a gesture that has become familiar to me.</t4731> <t4732>We have compiled a repertoire of such gestures, such familiarities, between us.</t4732> <t4733>He looks at me, not with malice but with curiosity, as if I am a puzzle to be solved.</t4733>
<t4734>“What would you like to read tonight?” he says.</t4734> <t4735>This has also become a habit.</t4735> <t4736>So far, I've read a Mademoiselle magazine, an old Esquire from the eighties, an MS, a magazine I vaguely remember seeing in my mother's various apartments while growing up, and a Reader's Digest.</t4736> <t4737>There are even novels.</t4737> <t4738>I've read a work by Raymond Chandler and am now halfway through Charles Dickens' Hard Times.</t4738> <t4739>On these occasions, I read quickly, voraciously, almost skimming, trying to cram as much as possible into my mind before the next period of hunger.</t4739> <t4740>If this were food, it would be the gluttony of the starving; if it were sex, it would be a quickie in some back alley.</t4740>
<t4741>While I am reading, the Commander sits and watches me read, without speaking, but without taking his eyes off me.</t4741> <t4742>This watching is a strange sexual act, and while he does it, I feel naked.</t4742> <t4743>I wish he would turn his back, walk around the room, read something to himself.</t4743> <t4744>That way, I could relax more, I wouldn't need to hurry.</t4744> <t4745>In the current situation, my illegal reading seems like a kind of performance.</t4745>
<t4746>“I think I would prefer to talk,” I say.</t4746> <t4747>Hearing myself say this surprises me.</t4747>
<t4748>He smiles again.</t4748> <t4749>He doesn't look surprised.</t4749> <t4750>Maybe he was expecting this or something like it.</t4750> <t4751>“Yes?” he says.</t4751> <t4752>“What would you like to talk about?</t4752><t4753>”</t4753>
<t4754>I hesitate.</t4754> <t4755>"Anything, I guess.</t4755> <t4756>Well, you, for example.</t4756><t4757>"</t4757>
<t4758>“Me?” He continues to smile.</t4758> <t4759>“Well, there's not much to say about me.</t4759> <t4760>I'm just an ordinary guy.</t4760><t4761>”</t4761>
<t4762>The unreality of this and even his diction - "guy?" - suddenly strikes me.</t4762> <t4763>Ordinary guys don't become Commanders.</t4763> <t4764>"There must be something you do well," I say.</t4764> <t4765>I know that I am provoking him, flattering him, enticing him to talk, and I hate myself for it, it's actually disgusting.</t4765> <t4766>But we talk in fits and starts.</t4766> <t4767>Either he talks or I will.</t4767> <t4768>I know this, I am dying to talk, I feel it, it's been so long since I really talked to someone.</t4768> <t4769>The short, whispered conversation I had with Glen today during our walk doesn't really count; but it was a softening, a beginning.</t4769> <t4770>After feeling the relief of even that little bit of conversation, I want more.</t4770>
<t4771>And if I talk to him, I might say something wrong, I might give away a secret.</t4771> <t4772>I can feel it happening, the betrayal of myself.</t4772> <t4773>I don't want him to know too much.</t4773>
<t4774>“Oh, to start with, I was in the market research business,” she says shyly.</t4774> <t4775>“After that, I branched out into other areas.</t4775><t4776>”</t4776>
<t4777>Although I know that he is a Commander, I suddenly realize that I don't know what kind of Commander he is.</t4777> <t4778>What does he control, what is his domain, as they used to say?</t4778> <t4779>They don't have special titles.</t4779>
<t4780>“Oh,” I say, trying to look as if I understand.</t4780>
<t4781>“You could say I am a kind of scientist,” he says.</t4781> <t4782>“In a limited sense, of course.</t4782><t4783>”</t4783>
<t4784>After that, we don't say anything for a while, neither do I.</t4784> <t4785>We are both waiting for each other.</t4785>
<t4786>I am the first to speak.</t4786> <t4787>"Well, maybe you can explain something I've been curious about for a long time.</t4787><t4788>"</t4788>
<t4789>Interested.</t4789> <t4790>“What could this be?</t4790><t4791>”</t4791>
<t4792>I am putting myself in danger, but I can't help it.</t4792> <t4793>"A sentence I remember from somewhere."</t4793> <t4794>It's best not to say where it's from.</t4794> <t4795>"I think it's Latin, maybe I thought, maybe..."</t4795> <t4796>I know there is a Latin dictionary.</t4796> <t4797>I know there are various dictionaries, on the top shelf to the left of the fireplace.</t4797>
<t4798>"Speak," he says.</t4798> <t4799>Distant, yet alert, or is it just my impression?</t4799>
<t4800>"Don't let the bastards grind you down," I say.</t4800>
<t4801>“What?” he says.</t4801>
<t4802>I had not pronounced it correctly.</t4802> <t4803>I don't know how it is.</t4803> <t4804>"I can spell it," I say.</t4804> <t4805>"I can write it too.</t4805><t4806>"</t4806>
<t4807>He hesitates on this new idea.</t4807> <t4808>Maybe he doesn't remember that I can do it.</t4808> <t4809>I never took a fountain pen or a pencil in my hand, even in this room, to add up the scores.</t4809> <t4810>Women can't do arithmetic, he once said, jokingly.</t4810> <t4811>When I asked what he meant, | he said, For them, one plus one plus one plus one doesn't make four.</t4811>
<t4812>What would it be? I had asked, expecting the answer to be either five or three.</t4812>
<t4813>One plus one plus one plus one equals only one.</t4813>
<t4814>But now he says "Okay," and almost defiantly pushes his ballpoint pen towards me from across the table, as if meeting a challenge.</t4814> <t4815>I'm looking for something to write on, and he hands me a score notepad, a desktop notepad with a smiley face on it.</t4815> <t4816>So they still make these things.</t4816>
<t4817>I am carefully writing the sentence, copying it from inside my mind, from inside my closet.</t4817> <t4818>Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t4818> <t4819>Here, in this context, it is neither a prayer nor a command, but merely a sad graffiti, scribbled once and then abandoned.</t4819> <t4820>The pen between my fingers feels sensory, almost alive, I can feel its power, the power of the words it contains.</t4820> <t4821>The pen is envy, Aunt Lydia would say, quoting another slogan from the Center, warning us to stay away from such objects.</t4821> <t4822>And they were right, it is envy.</t4822> <t4823>Just holding it, we were envious.</t4823> <t4824>I envy the Commander's pen.</t4824> <t4825>Another thing I want to steal…</t4825>
<t4826>The commander takes the smiling-faced page from me and looks at it.</t4826> <t4827>Then he starts laughing, is he blushing or what?</t4827> <t4828>“This is not real Latin,” he says.</t4828> <t4829>“This is just a joke.</t4829><t4830>”</t4830>
<t4831>“Is this a joke?” I say, now in astonishment.</t4831> <t4832>This can't just be a joke.</t4832> <t4833>Did I risk this, reach out for knowledge, just for a joke?</t4833> <t4834>“What kind of joke?</t4834><t4835>”</t4835>
<t4836>“You know how male students are,” he says.</t4836> <t4837>His laugh is nostalgic, I can see it now, a tolerant laugh towards his former self.</t4837> <t4838>He stands up, walks towards the bookshelves, takes a book from his treasure; but not the dictionary.</t4838> <t4839>An old book, it looks like a textbook, the corners of the pages are bent and ink-stained.</t4839> <t4840>Before showing it to me, he flips through the pages, absent-mindedly, reminiscing; then he says, “Here it is,” placing the open book in front of me.</t4840>
<t4841>The first picture I saw: Venus of Milo15, a black-and-white photo, with a mustache clumsily drawn on it, a black bra, and armpit hair.</t4841> <t4842>On the opposite page, the Colosseum in Rome with English subtitles and below it a sentence: sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt16.</t4842> <t4843>"Here it is," he says, pointing, I see it written in ink on the edge of the page with the hair drawn on Venus: Nolite te bastardes carborundorum.</t4843>
<t4844>“It's very hard to explain why it's funny without knowing Latin,” he says.</t4844> <t4845>“We used to write such mocking things in the past.</t4845> <t4846>I don't know where we found them, maybe from older kids.”</t4846> <t4847>He turns the pages, forgetting me and himself.</t4847> <t4848>“Look at this,” he says.</t4848> <t4849>The name of the picture is The Sabine Women17 and these words are scribbled on the edge of the page: pim pis pil, pimus, pistis pants.</t4849> <t4850>“There was another one,” he says.</t4850> <t4851>“Cim cis cit...”</t4851> <t4852>He stops, returning to the present moment, bewildered.</t4852> <t4853>He smiles again; this time it could be called a grin.</t4853> <t4854>I imagine him freckled, with a stubborn tuft of hair.</t4854> <t4855>Right now, I almost like him.</t4855>
<t4856>"But what did it mean? I ask."</t4856>
<t4857>“Which one?” he says.</t4857> <t4858>“Oh.</t4858> <t4859>It meant: 'Don't let those bastards grind you down.'</t4859> <t4860>I guess we thought we were pretty smart back then.</t4860><t4861>”</t4861>
<t4862>I'm forcing myself to smile, but now everything is in front of my eyes.</t4862> <t4863>I can understand why the one before me wrote this, on the wall of the closet, but I also understand that they learned this, here, in this room.</t4863> <t4864>Where else could it be?</t4864> <t4865>He was never a male student.</t4865> <t4866>With the Commander, during the exchange of childhood memories and trust.</t4866> <t4867>So I wasn't the first, entering his silence, playing word games with him like children.</t4867>
<t4868>"What happened to him?" I say.</t4868>
<t4869>Doesn't miss even the smallest detail.</t4869> <t4870>"Did you know him?</t4870><t4871>"</t4871>
<t4872>“In a way,” I say.</t4872>
<t4873>“He hanged himself,” he says; not sad, but thoughtful.</t4873> <t4874>“That’s why we removed the light fixtures.</t4874> <t4875>The one in your room.” He pauses.</t4875> <t4876>“Serena understood,” he says, as if that explains everything.</t4876> <t4877>And it does.</t4877>
<t4878>If your dog dies, get another one.</t4878>
<t4879>“With what?” I say.</t4879>
<t4880>He doesn't want to give me any ideas.</t4880> <t4881>"Does it matter?" he says.</t4881> <t4882>With torn sheets, I think.</t4882> <t4883>I had also considered the possibilities.</t4883>
<t4884>"I think it was Cora who found it," I say.</t4884> <t4885>So that's why she was screaming.</t4885>
<t4886>“Yes,” he says.</t4886> <t4887>“Poor girl.” He means Cora.</t4887>
<t4888>“Maybe I shouldn't come here anymore,” I say.</t4888>
<t4889>“I thought you liked it,” he says softly, still watching me with careful, bright eyes.</t4889> <t4890>If I didn't have enough sense, I would think it was fear.</t4890> <t4891>“I want you to come.</t4891><t4892>”</t4892>
<t4893>“You want my life to be bearable for me,” I say.</t4893> <t4894>It comes out of my mouth not as a question but as a plain statement; plain and dimensionless.</t4894> <t4895>If my life were bearable, maybe I wouldn't care about what they did.</t4895>
<t4896>“Yes,” he says.</t4896> <t4897>“That's right.</t4897> <t4898>I would prefer that.</t4898><t4899>”</t4899>
<t4900>“Alright then,” I say.</t4900> <t4901>Things have changed.</t4901> <t4902>Now, I have something against him.</t4902> <t4903>What I have against him is my own possibility of death.</t4903> <t4904>What is against him is his own guilt.</t4904> <t4905>Finally.</t4905>
<t4906>“What did you want?” he says, still with that lightness, as if the matter were merely a money transfer, or even something smaller: candies, cigarettes.</t4906>
<t4907>"Outside of the lotion, you mean?" I say.</t4907>
<t4908>“Except for the lotion,” he agrees.</t4908>
<t4909>“I wish...” I say.</t4909> <t4910>“I wish I knew.”</t4910> <t4911>This seems indecisive, even foolish, I say it without thinking.</t4911> <t4912>“Know what?” he says.</t4912>
<t4913>“Whatever needs to be known,” I say; but this is very disrespectful.</t4913> <t4914>“Everything that has happened.</t4914><t4915>”</t4915>
<t4916>XI</t4916>
<t4917>Night</t4917>
<t4918>30</t4918>
<t4919>Darkness is falling.</t4919> <t4920>Or it has fallen.</t4920> <t4921>Why is it said that darkness falls instead of saying it rises like the sun?</t4921> <t4922>Yet, if you look east at sunset, you can see that darkness rises instead of falling; rising in the sky from the horizon, like a dark sun behind a cloud cover.</t4922> <t4923>Like smoke from an invisible fire, a line of fire just below the horizon, a forest fire or a burning city.</t4923> <t4924>Maybe darkness is falling because it is heavy, like a thick curtain drawn over the eyes.</t4924> <t4925>Like a cotton blanket.</t4925> <t4926>I wish I could see in the dark, better than I do now.</t4926>
<t4927>Let the darkness fall, then.</t4927> <t4928>I feel it weighing down on me like a stone.</t4928> <t4929>No breeze.</t4929> <t4930>I am sitting by the half-open window, the curtains drawn back since there's no one outside, no need to feign modesty, wearing my nightgown, long-sleeved even in summer, to protect us from seducing our own bodies, from embracing ourselves with our bare arms.</t4930> <t4931>Nothing moves in the spotlighted moonlight.</t4931> <t4932>The scent from the garden rises like heat from a body, it must be the night-blooming flowers, so strong is this scent.</t4932> <t4933>I can almost see it, the red shimmer rising in waves like the quivering air over the asphalt of the main road at noon.</t4933>
<t4934>Down in the grassy area, someone emerges from the fringed darkness of the willow and passes through the light, their long shadow clinging to their heels.</t4934> <t4935>Is this Nick, or someone else, someone insignificant?</t4935> <t4936>They stop and look up at this window, and I can see the white rectangle of their face.</t4936> <t4937>Nick.</t4937> <t4938>We look at each other.</t4938> <t4939>I have no smile to give, nor does he have his lute.</t4939> <t4940>Yet, it's the same hunger.</t4940>
<t4941>I can't let myself succumb to this hunger.</t4941> <t4942>I pull the curtain on the left, thus covering my face and stepping between us, and Nick continues walking immediately afterward, turning the corner into invisibility.</t4942>
<t4943>The Commander is right.</t4943> <t4944>One plus one plus one plus one does not equal four.</t4944> <t4945>Each one remains alone, there is no way to combine them.</t4945> <t4946>One cannot be exchanged for the other.</t4946> <t4947>They cannot take each other's place.</t4947> <t4948>Nick cannot take Luke's place, nor can Luke take Nick's place.</t4948> <t4949>Necessity does not work here.</t4949>
<t4950>You cannot control your emotions, Moira once said, but you can adjust your behavior.</t4950>
<t4951>It's easy to say, of course.</t4951>
<t4952>Context is everything; or is it maturity?</t4952> <t4953>One or the other.</t4953>
<t4954>The night before we left the house, I was wandering through the rooms for the last time.</t4954> <t4955>Nothing was packed because we weren't taking much with us, and even then, we couldn't risk leaving the impression that we were leaving for good.</t4955> <t4956>For this reason, I was just wandering around, here and there, glancing at the items and the arrangements we had made for our shared life.</t4956> <t4957>I had the thought that I might be able to remember what it looked like later.</t4957>
<t4958>Luke was in the living room.</t4958> <t4959>He wrapped his arms around me.</t4959> <t4960>We both felt miserable.</t4960> <t4961>How else would we know we were happy, even then?</t4961> <t4962>Because at least we had this: the arms that embraced us.</t4962>
<t4963>Cat; that's what he said.</t4963>
<t4964>"A cat?" I said, towards the wool of her sweater.</t4964> <t4965>"We can't just leave it here like this."</t4965>
<t4966>I hadn't thought about the cat.</t4966> <t4967>Neither of us had thought about it.</t4967> <t4968>Our decision had been sudden, and then planning had been done to carry it out.</t4968> <t4969>I must have thought the cat would come with us.</t4969> <t4970>But it couldn't come; no one takes a cat along for a day trip across the border.</t4970>
<t4971>Why don't we let it out? I said.</t4971> <t4972>We can set it free.</t4972> <t4973>It would wander around and meow at the door.</t4973> <t4974>Someone would notice that we were gone.</t4974>
<t4975>We can give it to someone, I said.</t4975> <t4976>To one of the neighbors.</t4976> <t4977>As soon as I said this, I realized how foolish it would be.</t4977>
<t4978>"I'll take care of it," said Luke.</t4978> <t4979>I understood that by "it" he meant killing.</t4979> <t4980>This is what you have to do before killing, I thought.</t4980> <t4981>You will create a "him" where there wasn't one before.</t4981> <t4982>You handle it first in your mind, and then you carry it out.</t4982> <t4983>So, this is how they do it, I thought.</t4983> <t4984>It felt like I had never known this before.</t4984>
<t4985>Luke had found the cat hiding under our bed.</t4985> <t4986>They always understand.</t4986> <t4987>He went to the garage with it.</t4987> <t4988>I don't know what he did and I never asked.</t4988> <t4989>I sat in the living room with my hands in my lap.</t4989> <t4990>I should have gone outside with him, I should have shared this small responsibility.</t4990> <t4991>At the very least, I should have asked him afterward, so he wouldn't have to bear this burden alone; because this small sacrifice, the extinguishing of a life for the sake of love, was also done for my sake.</t4991>
<t4992>Here, this is one of the things they do.</t4992> <t4993>They force you to kill yourself, within.</t4993>
<t4994>It was unnecessary, as it turned out later.</t4994> <t4995>I wonder who told them.</t4995> <t4996>It could have been a neighbor, watching our car leave the street in the morning, reporting with foresight to get into someone's good graces.</t4996> <t4997>It could even have been the man who found our passports; why wouldn't he take money twice?</t4997> <t4998>It might even be their job to place those who make fake passports there; a network that catches the careless ones.</t4998> <t4999>The Eyes of God reach every corner of the earth.</t4999>
<t5000>Because they were already waiting for us.</t5000> <t5001>The moment of betrayal is the worst, the moment you realize without a doubt that you have been betrayed: that another person has wished so much harm upon you.</t5001>
<t5002>It was like being in an elevator whose cable was cut from the top.</t5002> <t5003>Falling, falling, and not knowing when it would crash.</t5003>
<t5004>Wherever they are, I try to revive and summon my own ghosts.</t5004> <t5005>I need to remember what they look like.</t5005> <t5006>I try to keep them still behind my eyes, their faces, like photographs in an album.</t5006> <t5007>But they won't stay still for me, they move, there's a smile and it's gone, their lines curling and bending like burning paper, darkness swallows them.</t5007> <t5008>A momentary image, a faint glow in the air; a glimmer, colored lights, the dance of electrons, then again a face, faces.</t5008> <t5009>Yet they vanish, despite my reaching out to them, they slip away from me, ghosts of dawn.</t5009> <t5010>Back to where they belong.</t5010> <t5011>Stay with me, I want to say.</t5011> <t5012>But they won't stay.</t5012> <t5013>It's my fault.</t5013> <t5014>I forget too much.</t5014>
<t5015>I will pray tonight.</t5015>
<t5016>Kneeling at the foot of the bed on the hard wooden floor of the gym, Aunt Lydia would hunch our backs or, if we relaxed, she would lightly tap our backs, feet, buttocks, or arms with the wooden prod - just a flick, a touch - as she walked among the rows of kneeling women in nightgowns, while Aunt Elizabeth stood by the double doors, arms crossed, the prod hanging from her belt, no longer.</t5016> <t5017>Aunt Lydia wanted us to bow our heads properly, keep our feet together and flat, and our elbows at the right angle.</t5017> <t5018>The reason she was so insistent was her passion for aesthetics: She liked this image.</t5018> <t5019>She wanted us to look like something carved on an Anglo-Saxon tombstone; or like Christmas card angels, lined up in our garments of chastity.</t5019> <t5020>But she also knew the spiritual value of physical rigidity, of muscle tension: A little pain clears the mind, she would say.</t5020>
<t5021>Our prayers were for the void, so that we would be worthy of being filled: With grace, love, sacrifice, sperm, and babies.</t5021>
<t5022>Oh God, King of the Universe, thank you for not creating me as a man.</t5022>
<t5023>Oh God, purify me.</t5023> <t5024>Make me fruitful.</t5024> <t5025>Dull my desires so that I may flourish.</t5025> <t5026>Make me content...</t5026>
<t5027>Some would lose themselves in these.</t5027> <t5028>The ecstasy of humiliation.</t5028> <t5029>Some would moan and cry.</t5029>
<t5030>There's no point in making a fool of yourself, Janine, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t5030>
<t5031>I pray where I am, sitting at the window, looking at the empty garden through the curtain.</t5031> <t5032>I don't even close my eyes.</t5032> <t5033>There, outside or inside my head, there is the same darkness.</t5033> <t5034>Or light.</t5034>
<t5035>My God.</t5035> <t5036>You who are inside, who are in the Kingdom of Heaven.</t5036>
<t5037>I wish you would tell me your name, your real name, I mean.</t5037> <t5038>But only You can see this.</t5038>
<t5039>I would like to know what your purpose is.</t5039> <t5040>But no matter what happens, please help me endure this.</t5040> <t5041>Even if it's not your job; I don't believe for a moment that what's happening out there is something you want.</t5041>
<t5042>I have enough daily sustenance, so I will not spend time on that.</t5042> <t5043>The main problem is not this.</t5043> <t5044>The problem is being able to swallow it without choking.</t5044>
<t5045>Now it's time for forgiveness.</t5045> <t5046>Don't bother trying to forgive me now.</t5046> <t5047>There are more important things.</t5047> <t5048>For example: protect the others, if they are safe.</t5048> <t5049>Don't let them suffer too much.</t5049> <t5050>If they have to die, let their deaths be quick.</t5050> <t5051>You can even provide a heaven for them.</t5051> <t5052>We need You for that.</t5052> <t5053>We can create hell on our own.</t5053>
<t5054>I suppose I need to say that I forgive whoever did this and whatever they are doing right now.</t5054> <t5055>I will try, but it won't be easy.</t5055>
<t5056>It's time for seduction.</t5056> <t5057>In the Center, seduction went far beyond eating and sleeping.</t5057> <t5058>To know was to be seduced.</t5058> <t5059>What you don't know can't seduce you, Aunt Lydia used to say.</t5059>
<t5060>Maybe I don't truly want to know what's going on.</t5060> <t5061>Maybe I prefer not knowing.</t5061> <t5062>Maybe I couldn't bear to know; the Fall of Man was a fall from innocence to knowledge.</t5062>
<t5063>Even though it's no longer there, I think about the chandelier a lot.</t5063> <t5064>But a hook in the bathroom can be used.</t5064> <t5065>I examined the possibilities.</t5065> <t5066>All that needs to be done is, after attaching yourself to the hook, to shift your weight forward and not struggle.</t5066>
<t5067>Deliver us from evil.</t5067>
<t5068>Then next in line are the Kingdom, power, and glory.</t5068> <t5069>Right now, it's very hard to believe in these.</t5069> <t5070>But still, I will try.</t5070> <t5071>With hope, as they say on the tombstones.</t5071>
<t5072>You must be feeling like you've been robbed.</t5072> <t5073>I guess this isn't the first time.</t5073>
<t5074>If I were you, I would be exhausted.</t5074> <t5075>I would be truly fed up with this.</t5075> <t5076>I guess that's the difference between us.</t5076>
<t5077>I feel very unreal when talking to you like this.</t5077> <t5078>As if I'm talking to a wall.</t5078> <t5079>I wish you had responded.</t5079> <t5080>I feel so lonely.</t5080>
<t5081>All alone next to the phone.</t5081> <t5082>But I can't use the phone.</t5082> <t5083>Even if I could use it, who could I call?</t5083>
<t5084>Oh my God.</t5084> <t5085>This is not a joke.</t5085> <t5086>Oh my God, Oh my God.</t5086> <t5087>How can I continue living?</t5087>
<t5088>XII</t5088>
<t5089>Jezebel's Place</t5089>
<t5090>31</t5090>
<t5091>Every night when I go to bed, I think that I will wake up in my own home in the morning and everything will return to the way it was.</t5091> <t5092>This morning, it didn't happen again.</t5092>
<t5093>I am putting on my clothes, my summer clothes, it is still summer, as if the season has stopped in summer.</t5093> <t5094>July, breathless days and nights as hot as a bath, it's hard to sleep.</t5094> <t5095>I am careful not to lose my connection with time.</t5095> <t5096>I should have made notches on the wall, one for each day of the week, and when I reached seven, a diagonal line over them.</t5096> <t5097>But what good would that do, this is not a prison sentence; there is no set period to be spent here and then finished.</t5097> <t5098>Still, all I have to do is ask, to find out what day it is.</t5098> <t5099>Yesterday was July 4th, it used to be Independence Day, before they canceled it.</t5099> <t5100>September 1st will be Birth Day18, they celebrate that.</t5100> <t5101>Even though it didn't used to be about mothers.</t5101>
<t5102>However, I understand the time by looking at the moon.</t5102> <t5103>I use the lunar year, not the solar year.</t5103>
<t5104>I bend forward to put on my red shoes; these days they are made lighter, with unobtrusive cuts on them, though they are not as daring as sandals.</t5104> <t5105>Bending over requires effort; despite the exercises, I can feel my body getting heavier and resisting.</t5105> <t5106>Being such a woman is the same as my old idea of what it would be like to be very old.</t5106> <t5107>I even feel like I'm walking that way: Bent forward, my spine turned into a question mark, calcium drained and flowed from my bones, and they are porous like limestone.</t5107> <t5108>When I was young and in the age of dreaming, I used to think that maybe when one has little time left, they understand the value of everything better.</t5108> <t5109>I forgot to account for the loss of energy.</t5109> <t5110>Some days I value certain things, like eggs, flowers, more, but then I decide that I have just been hit by a wave of sentimentality, and my mind turns into pastel Technicolor, like those countless beautiful sunset greeting cards they used to make in California.</t5110> <t5111>Overly bright hearts.</t5111> <t5112>The danger lies in losing sight.</t5112>
<t5113>I wish Luke were here, in this bedroom, while I was getting dressed, so I could argue with him.</t5113> <t5114>It's silly, but that's what I want.</t5114> <t5115>An argument about who will load the dishwasher, whose turn it is to fold the laundry and clean the toilet; usually something mundane and trivial given the course of events.</t5115> <t5116>We could even argue about whether it was important or trivial.</t5116> <t5117>What a great luxury that would be.</t5117> <t5118>Not that we argued a lot.</t5118> <t5119>These days, I script big fights in my mind, and the subsequent make-ups too.</t5119>
<t5120>I am sitting in my chair, the wreath on the ceiling floats above my head, frozen like a halo, like a zero.</t5120><t5121>A hole opened where a star exploded in space.</t5121><t5122>A ring formed where a stone was thrown into the water.</t5122><t5123>Everything is white and circular.</t5123><t5124>I am waiting for the day to unfold, for the world to turn, according to the round face of the relentless clock.</t5124><t5125>Smooth and oiled, the geometric days keep turning.</t5125><t5126>Sweat has already accumulated on my upper lip, as warm as the room's temperature, and a green layer has formed on the yellow, and I am waiting for the inevitable arrival of the egg that will give a slight taste of sulfur.</t5126>
<t5127>Today, later, we are on a shopping walk with Gleninki.</t5127>
<t5128>As usual, we go to the church and look at the graves.</t5128> <t5129>Then to the Wall.</t5129> <t5130>Today there are only two hanged: one is Catholic, but not a priest, labeled with an upside-down cross, the other from a denomination I can't identify.</t5130> <t5131>The body is marked only with a red J19.</t5131> <t5132>Not Jewish, theirs is a yellow star.</t5132> <t5133>Though, there weren't many of them left.</t5133> <t5134>Because they were declared as the sons of Jacob and thus were special, they were given a choice.</t5134> <t5135>They could convert or migrate to Israel.</t5135> <t5136>Many migrated, if you can believe the news.</t5136> <t5137>I saw a shipload of them, on television, leaning over the railings in their black coats and hats and long beards, trying to look as Jewish as possible; in costumes hunted from the past, smiling and waving women with shawls on their heads.</t5137> <t5138>True, it seemed a bit forced, as if they were posing; then another shot, the wealthier ones lining up to board planes.</t5138> <t5139>Glen's says others also pretended to be Jewish to get out this way, but because of the tests they applied, it wasn't easy, and now they've made it even harder.</t5139>
<t5140>Still, you are not hanged merely for being Jewish.</t5140> <t5141>You are hanged for being a Jew who makes the wrong choice and causes trouble, or for pretending to have converted.</t5141> <t5142>This was also shown on television: night raids, hidden Jewish stocks pulled out from under beds, Torahs, prayer shawls, Stars of David.</t5142> <t5143>And as the announcer's sorrowful voice narrated their betrayals and ingratitude to us, the stern-faced incorrigible owners were plastered on the bedroom walls by the Eyes.</t5143>
<t5144>Therefore, J does not mean Jewish.</t5144> <t5145>What could it be?</t5145> <t5146>Jehovah's Witnesses?</t5146> <t5147>Jesuit?</t5147> <t5148>Whatever it means, it's just plain dead.</t5148>
<t5149>After this ceremonial viewing, we continue on our way, as always, towards an open area where we can talk.</t5149> <t5150>If it can be called talking, of course, these clipped Utterances coming from the channel of our white wings.</t5150> <t5151>It resembles more of a telegraph, a verbal semaphore.</t5151> <t5152>A pruned conversation.</t5152>
<t5153>We never stay in one place for very long.</t5153> <t5154>We don't want to get caught for wandering aimlessly.</t5154>
<t5155>Today we are turning in the exact opposite direction of the Prayer Cylinders, where there is an open park with a large, old building adorned with stained glass in late Victorian style.</t5155> <t5156>It used to be called Memorial Hall, but I never knew what it was a memorial for.</t5156> <t5157>For dead people.</t5157>
<t5158>Moira once said that this place was used as the students' cafeteria during the early years of the university.</t5158> <t5159>She said that if a woman entered, they would throw bread at her.</t5159>
<t5160>Why? I had asked.</t5160> <t5161>Moira, over the years, was becoming increasingly adept at these kinds of stories.</t5161> <t5162>I didn't quite like this, harboring such resentment towards the past.</t5162>
<t5163>To get the woman out, Moira had said.</t5163>
<t5164>Maybe it was more like throwing peanuts at elephants, I had said.</t5164>
<t5165>Moira had laughed; she could laugh at any moment.</t5165> <t5166>Exotic monsters, she had said.</t5166>
<t5167>We are standing and looking at this building, which more or less resembles a church, a cathedral in form.</t5167> <t5168>Gleninki says, "I heard that this is where the Eyes of Here hold their feasts."</t5168>
<t5169>“Who told you this?” I say.</t5169> <t5170>There is no one nearby, we can talk more freely, but out of habit, we speak in low voices.</t5170>
<t5171>“A walking news gazette,” he says.</t5171> <t5172>He pauses, looks at me from the side, I can perceive the whiteness as the wings move.</t5172> <t5173>“There is a password,” he says.</t5173>
<t5174>“A password?” I ask.</t5174> <t5175>“For what?</t5175><t5176>”</t5176>
<t5177>"To understand who is with us and who is not," he says.</t5177>
<t5178>Even though I don't understand how knowing this will be useful to me, I ask: "What is it?"</t5178><t5179>"</t5179>
<t5180>“Mayday,” he says.</t5180> <t5181>“I tried it on you once.</t5181><t5182>”</t5182>
<t5183>“Mayday,” I repeat.</t5183> <t5184>I remember that day.</t5184> <t5185>M'aidez.</t5185>
<t5186>"Don't use it unless you have to," says Gleninki.</t5186> <t5187>"It's not good for us to know too many people from the others, that is, those in the network.</t5187> <t5188>In case we get caught.</t5188><t5189>"</t5189>
<t5190>These whispers, these explanations are hard for me to believe, though I always believe them at the moment.</t5190> <t5191>But later they seem impossible, even childish, like something done for fun; just like a girls' club, like secrets at school.</t5191> <t5192>Or like the spy novels I used to read on weekends when I should have been finishing my homework, or the TV shows I watched late at night.</t5192> <t5193>Passwords, things that can't be explained, people with secret identities and dark connections: This doesn't seem like the real shape of the world.</t5193> <t5194>But this is my own illusion, something left over from the interpretation of reality I learned in the past.</t5194>
<t5195>And networks.</t5195> <t5196>Networking, one of my mother's old expressions, the outdated slang of last year.</t5196> <t5197>Even at sixty, she still did things she called that, although to me it just meant having lunch with another woman.</t5197>
<t5198>I leave Gleninki at the corner.</t5198> <t5199>“See you later,” he says.</t5199> <t5200>He slowly walks away on the sidewalk, and I start walking up the road towards home.</t5200> <t5201>There’s Nick, his hat askew; he’s not even looking at me today.</t5201> <t5202>Still, he must have waited for me to convey his silent message, because as soon as he realizes I’ve seen him, he gives Whirlwind one last wipe with the chamois in his hand and quickly heads towards the garage door.</t5202>
<t5203>I'm walking on the gravel path that divides the overly green lawn.</t5203> <t5204>Serena Joy is sitting in her chair under the willow tree, her cane hanging from her elbow.</t5204> <t5205>Her dress is made of cool cotton.</t5205> <t5206>Blue, water-colored, not like mine which absorbs heat and is also burning red.</t5206> <t5207>I see her from the side, she is knitting.</t5207> <t5208>How can she bear to touch the wool in this heat?</t5208> <t5209>But maybe her skin has become insensitive; maybe she feels nothing, like someone who was scalded with boiling water in the past.</t5209>
<t5210>I lower my gaze to the path, hoping to be invisible, knowing I will be ignored, I slip past.</t5210> <t5211>But this time it doesn't work.</t5211>
<t5212>“Fredinki,” he says.</t5212>
<t5213>I am standing, undecided.</t5213>
<t5214>“Yes, you.”</t5214><t5215>”</t5215>
<t5216>I turn my veiled gaze towards him.</t5216> <t5217>"Come here.</t5217> <t5218>I want you.</t5218><t5219>"</t5219>
<t5220>I walk past the lawn and stand in front of it, looking down.</t5220>
<t5221>“You can sit,” he says.</t5221> <t5222>“Here, take this pillow.</t5222> <t5223>I need you to hold the wool.”</t5223> <t5224>He has a cigarette, an ashtray beside him on the grass, and a cup of tea or coffee.</t5224> <t5225>“It’s damn stuffy in there.</t5225> <t5226>You need some air,” he says.</t5226> <t5227>I sit down, placing my basket on the ground, which again contains strawberries, again chicken, and I notice the cursing: something new.</t5227> <t5228>He places the skein of wool on my outstretched arms and starts winding it.</t5228> <t5229>Apparently, I’m collared, handcuffed; caught in a spider’s web, that’s more accurate.</t5229> <t5230>The wool is gray and has absorbed the moisture in the air, like a peed-on baby blanket, and it smells faintly of wet sheep.</t5230> <t5231>At least my hands will get lanolined.</t5231>
<t5232>Serena is winding the wool, while the cigarette at the corner of her mouth sends out a tempting smoke as it burns slowly.</t5232> <t5233>Due to her gradually paralyzing hands, she winds it slowly and with difficulty, but with determination.</t5233> <t5234>Knitting, for her, perhaps means testing her willpower in some way; it might even be causing her pain.</t5234> <t5235>Maybe it was recommended for health reasons: ten rows of knit, ten rows of purl per day.</t5235> <t5236>However, she must be doing more than that.</t5236> <t5237>I see those ever-green trees and geometric boys and girls from a different perspective: proof of her utterly undeniable stubbornness.</t5237>
<t5238>My mother did not knit or do similar things.</t5238> <t5239>However, whenever she picked something up from the cleaner, such as precious blouses or winter coats, she would collect the safety pins and make a chain out of them.</t5239> <t5240>Then she would pin this chain somewhere - to her bed, her pillow, the back of a chair, the oven mitt in the kitchen - so she wouldn't lose it.</t5240> <t5241>And then she would forget about it.</t5241> <t5242>I would find them here and there around the house, in the houses; traces of her existence, remnants of a lost intention, like signs on a road that seemed to lead nowhere.</t5242> <t5243>Returns to domestic life.</t5243>
<t5244>“Alright,” says Serena.</t5244> <t5245>She stops winding the wool, still leaves my arms wrapped in animal hairs, and takes the cigarette out of her mouth to extinguish it.</t5245> <t5246>“Is there still nothing?</t5246><t5247>”</t5247>
<t5248>I know what you're talking about.</t5248> <t5249>There aren't many topics we can discuss; there's not much common ground, except for that mysterious and chance-dependent thing.</t5249>
<t5250>“No,” I say.</t5250> <t5251>“There isn't.</t5251><t5252>”</t5252>
<t5253>“Very bad,” he says.</t5253> <t5254>It's hard to imagine him with a baby.</t5254> <t5255>But most of the time, the Marthas will take care of it.</t5255> <t5256>Still, he would have wanted me to get pregnant, finished, my job done and out of his way, no more humiliating sweaty embraces, no more bodily trios under the starry dome of silver flowers.</t5256> <t5257>Peace and Quiet.</t5257> <t5258>I can't imagine he would wish me good luck for any other reason.</t5258>
<t5259>“The time is almost up,” he says.</t5259> <t5260>This is not a question, it's a fact.</t5260>
<t5261>"Yes," I say impartially.</t5261>
<t5262>He lights another cigarette, fiddling with the lighter.</t5262> <t5263>The condition of his hands is definitely getting worse.</t5263> <t5264>However, offering to light his cigarette would be a mistake; he would take offense.</t5264> <t5265>The mistake of realizing his weakness.</t5265>
<t5266>"Maybe he can't do it," he says.</t5266>
<t5267>I don't know who you mean.</t5267> <t5268>The commander or God?</t5268> <t5269>If it's God, you should have said He doesn't do it.</t5269> <t5270>In either case, it's contrary to religious teachings.</t5270> <t5271>Those who can't do it, who are stubbornly closed off, stunted, and wrong are only women.</t5271>
<t5272>“No,” I say.</t5272> <t5273>“Maybe he can't do it.</t5273><t5274>”</t5274>
<t5275>I am looking at her.</t5275> <t5276>She is looking at me too.</t5276> <t5277>For the first time in a long time, we looked into each other's eyes.</t5277> <t5278>Since we met.</t5278> <t5279>This moment stretches between us, gloomy and fixed.</t5279> <t5280>She is trying to understand if I am telling the truth.</t5280>
<t5281>"Maybe," he says, holding the cigarette he couldn't light.</t5281> <t5282>"Perhaps you should try another way.</t5282><t5283>"</t5283>
<t5284>Does he mean on all fours?</t5284> <t5285>"Which way?" I say.</t5285> <t5286>I must maintain my seriousness.</t5286>
<t5287>“Another man,” he says.</t5287>
<t5288>"You know I can't do this," I say, trying not to show my discomfort.</t5288> <t5289>"This is against the laws.</t5289> <t5290>You know the penalty.</t5290><t5291>"</t5291>
<t5292>“Yes,” he says.</t5292> <t5293>He is ready for this, he has thought it through thoroughly.</t5293> <t5294>“I know you can't do this officially.</t5294> <t5295>But it is done.</t5295> <t5296>Women do this very often.</t5296> <t5297>All the time.</t5297><t5298>”</t5298>
<t5299>"With the doctors, you mean?" I say, recalling his sympathetic brown eyes and ungloved hands.</t5299> <t5300>There was another doctor the last time I went.</t5300> <t5301>Maybe someone exposed his crime, or a woman reported him.</t5301> <t5302>They wouldn't believe a woman's word, though, without evidence.</t5302>
<t5303>“Someone is doing this,” he says, his tone now almost gentle, but distant; as if we are deciding which brand of nail polish to buy.</t5303> <t5304>“Warren handled it this way.</t5304> <t5305>The spouse knew this, of course.”</t5305> <t5306>He pauses to let this sink in.</t5306> <t5307>“I would take care of you.</t5307> <t5308>I would make sure nothing goes wrong.</t5308><t5309>”</t5309>
<t5310>I am thinking about this.</t5310> <t5311>“It won't work with a doctor,” I say.</t5311>
<t5312>“Let it not be,” he agrees, at least for this moment we are like old friends, this could have been a kitchen table, it could have been a date we were discussing, a kind of girlish game for caging and flirting.</t5312> <t5313>“Sometimes they blackmail.</t5313> <t5314>But it doesn't have to be a doctor.</t5314> <t5315>It could be someone we trust.</t5315><t5316>”</t5316>
<t5317>“Who?” I say.</t5317>
<t5318>“I was thinking about Nick,” he says, his voice almost soft.</t5318> <t5319>“He's been with us for a long time.</t5319> <t5320>He's loyal.</t5320> <t5321>I could arrange this with him.</t5321><t5322>”</t5322>
<t5323>So, he's the one doing the small black market deals.</t5323> <t5324>Is this what he always gets in return?</t5324>
<t5325>“What will happen, Commander?” I say.</t5325>
<t5326>“Well,” he says, with composure; no, more than that, a grasping look, like a coin purse snapping shut all of a sudden.</t5326> <t5327>“We won't tell him anything, right?</t5327><t5328>”</t5328>
<t5329>This idea hangs between us, almost visible, almost tangible: heavy, shapeless, dark; a kind of collision, a kind of betrayal.</t5329> <t5330>She really wants this baby.</t5330>
<t5331>“This is a risk,” I say.</t5331> <t5332>“More than that.”</t5332> <t5333>My life is the one hanging by a thread; but sooner or later, it will end up there anyway, one way or another, whether I do it or not.</t5333> <t5334>We both are aware of this.</t5334>
<t5335>“You can still do it,” he says.</t5335> <t5336>That's what I think too.</t5336>
<t5337>“Okay,” I say.</t5337> <t5338>“Yes.</t5338><t5339>”</t5339>
<t5340>He leans forward.</t5340> <t5341>"Maybe he can find something for you," he says.</t5341> <t5342>Because I behaved well.</t5342> <t5343>"Something you want," he adds, almost fawningly.</t5343>
<t5344>"What is it?" I say.</t5344> <t5345>I can't think of anything he might give me or could give me that I really want.</t5345>
<t5346>“A picture,” he says, as if suggesting a youth serum, an ice cream, a trip to the zoo.</t5346> <t5347>I look at him again, astonished.</t5347>
<t5348>“His,” he says.</t5348> <t5349>“Little girl’s.</t5349> <t5350>But, maybe.</t5350><t5351>”</t5351>
<t5352>It means they know where they placed him, where they are keeping him.</t5352> <t5353>Apparently, he always knew this.</t5353> <t5354>Something is choking me.</t5354> <t5355>The bitch, not telling me this, not informing me, not hinting at anything.</t5355> <t5356>Not even saying the tiniest thing.</t5356> <t5357>Made of wood or iron, cannot dream.</t5357> <t5358>But I can't say this, I can't lose this, not even something this small.</t5358> <t5359>I can't give up this hope.</t5359> <t5360>I can't speak.</t5360>
<t5361>She is really smiling, coquettishly even; there is a hint of the charm of her previous small-screen modeling, flickering on her face like temporary parasites.</t5361> <t5362>"It's damn hot for this, don't you think?" she says.</t5362> <t5363>She takes the wool I've been holding all this time from my arms.</t5363> <t5364>Then, a bit clumsily, she squeezes the cigarette she has been flipping in her hand into my hand, closing my fingers over it.</t5364> <t5365>"Find yourself a match," she says.</t5365> <t5366>"There are some in the kitchen, you can ask Rita for one.</t5366> <t5367>Tell her I gave you permission.</t5367> <t5368>But only one," she adds mischievously.</t5368> <t5369>"We wouldn't want to ruin your health.</t5369><t5370>"</t5370>
<t5371>32</t5371>
<t5372>Rita is sitting at the kitchen table.</t5372> <t5373>On the table in front of her, there is a glass bowl with pieces of ice floating in it.</t5373> <t5374>Radishes, transformed into flowers, roses or tulips, are also bobbing up and down in it.</t5374> <t5375>She continues to cut on the board in front of her, with a paring knife, her large hands adept and indifferent to the task.</t5375> <t5376>The rest of her body is not moving, nor is her face.</t5376> <t5377>It's as if she's doing this knife trick in her sleep.</t5377> <t5378>On the white enamel surface, there is a pile of washed but uncut radishes.</t5378> <t5379>Little Aztec hearts.</t5379>
<t5380>When I enter, he doesn't bother to lift his head and look.</t5380> <t5381>"You got everything, huh," he says, while taking out the packages to inspect them.</t5381>
<t5382>"Can I have a match?" I ask.</t5382> <t5383>It's surprising how just a frown, with its indifference, makes me feel like a little beggar child; a persistent and whining child.</t5383>
<t5384>“A match?” he says.</t5384> <t5385>“What are you going to do with a match?</t5385><t5386>”</t5386>
<t5387>“He said I could take one,” I say, not wanting to reveal that I took a cigarette.</t5387>
<t5388>“Who is that?”</t5388> <t5389>She continues peeling the turnips, without breaking her rhythm.</t5389> <t5390>“You have no right to buy matches.</t5390> <t5391>You will burn the house down.</t5391><t5392>”</t5392>
<t5393>"If you want, you can go and ask him," I say.</t5393> <t5394>"Outside on the lawn.</t5394><t5395>"</t5395>
<t5396>Rita raises her eyes to the ceiling, as if silently consulting a god up there.</t5396> <t5397>Then she sighs and slowly gets up, wiping her hands on her apron in a showy manner, aiming to demonstrate what a big problem I am.</t5397> <t5398>Without hurrying, she walks towards the cabinet above the sink, reaches into her pocket for the key ring, and opens the cabinet door.</t5398> <t5399>“I keep them here, in the summer,” she says as if to herself.</t5399> <t5400>“There's no point in inviting a fire in this kind of weather.”</t5400> <t5401>As far as I remember from April, it is Cora who lights the fires in the sitting and dining rooms during cool weather.</t5401>
<t5402>The matches are in a wooden box with a sliding lid, the kind I used to envy for making baby drawers.</t5402> <t5403>He opens the box, looks inside, as if thinking about which one he will allow me to take.</t5403> <t5404>“That's his problem,” he mutters.</t5404> <t5405>“There's no way to explain anything to him.”</t5405> <t5406>He plunges his big hand inside, selects a match, and gives it to me.</t5406>
<t5407>“Now, don't even think about setting something on fire,” he says.</t5407> <t5408>“Be careful with the curtains in your room.</t5408> <t5409>The weather is already hot enough.</t5409><t5410>”</t5410>
<t5411>“I will not burn it,” I say.</t5411> <t5412>“I am not taking this for that reason.</t5412><t5413>”</t5413>
<t5414>He doesn't bother to ask what it's for.</t5414> <t5415>"Whether you eat it or do something else with it, I don't care," he says.</t5415> <t5416>"He said you could have one, so I'm giving you one, that's all.</t5416><t5417>"</t5417>
<t5418>He moves away from me and sits back at the table.</t5418> <t5419>Then the captain takes a piece of ice and puts it in his mouth.</t5419> <t5420>This is unusual behavior for him.</t5420> <t5421>I had never seen him munching on something while working.</t5421> <t5422>“You can have one too,” he says.</t5422> <t5423>“It's embarrassing to have you carry all these pillowcases on your head, in this weather.</t5423><t5424>”</t5424>
<t5425>I'm surprised: Usually, he doesn't offer me anything.</t5425> <t5426>Maybe he felt that he could make a small gesture since I had made enough progress to deserve a match.</t5426> <t5427>Had I suddenly become someone who needed to be kept happy?</t5427>
<t5428>“Thank you,” I say.</t5428> <t5429>I carefully place the match in the zippered pocket of my sleeve where the cigarette is, so it won't get wet; I take a piece of ice.</t5429> <t5430>“These radishes are very nice,” I say, as a reciprocation for the gift he spontaneously gave me.</t5430>
<t5431>“I like doing things right, that's all,” he says, grumpily again.</t5431> <t5432>“Otherwise, it loses its meaning.</t5432><t5433>”</t5433>
<t5434>I walk hurriedly up the stairs along the corridor.</t5434> <t5435>I pass by the curved hall mirror, a red shape, a ghost of red smoke, at the corner of my field of vision.</t5435> <t5436>The smoke, long, full, and dirty, with a cinnamon-like inhale filling my lungs, has already formed in my mind; I can already feel it in my mouth, followed by the rush when nicotine hits the blood.</t5436>
<t5437>After all this time, it could make me nauseous.</t5437> <t5438>I wouldn't be surprised by it.</t5438> <t5439>However, even this thought pleases me.</t5439>
<t5440>I walk along the corridor, where should I drink?</t5440> <t5441>In the bathroom while running the water to clean the air, or in the bedroom blowing out with a wheeze through the open window?</t5441> <t5442>Who will catch me?</t5442> <t5443>Who knows?</t5443>
<t5444>Even while savoring the anticipation in my mouth and enjoying the future in this way, I am thinking about something else.</t5444> <t5445>I don't need to smoke this cigarette.</t5445>
<t5446>I can tear it apart and flush it down the toilet, or I can eat it and lose myself in this way too, this might work, one piece at a time, saving the rest.</t5446>
<t5447>Thus, I won't waste the match.</t5447> <t5448>I can make a small hole in the mattress and carefully place the match inside.</t5448> <t5449>Something so thin would never attract attention.</t5449> <t5450>At night, it would stay there, beneath me while I'm in bed, sleeping on top of it.</t5450>
<t5451>I can burn the house down.</t5451> <t5452>It's such a beautiful thought, it makes me shiver.</t5452> <t5453>An escape, swift and by a hair's breadth.</t5453>
<t5454>The commander is looking at me while I sit, rubbing my hands with oily lotion, fingers together, last night.</t5454> <t5455>How strange, I had thought of asking him for a cigarette, but then I changed my mind.</t5455> <t5456>I know that one should not ask for too much at once.</t5456> <t5457>I don't want him to think I'm using him.</t5457> <t5458>Also, I don't want to interfere.</t5458>
<t5459>Last night he had been drinking, Scotch and water.</t5459> <t5460>He says he enjoys drinking beside me to unwind from the day's fatigue.</t5460> <t5461>I should conclude that he is under pressure.</t5461> <t5462>Still, he never offers me any, and I don't want it either: We both know what my body is for.</t5462> <t5463>When I give him a goodnight kiss, as if I really want to, I smell his alcohol-laden breath and inhale it like smoke.</t5463> <t5464>I admit that it gives me pleasure, this kiss of debauchery.</t5464>
<t5465>Occasionally, after a few drinks, he gets silly and cheats at Scrabble.</t5465> <t5466>He encourages me too; he takes extra letters and makes up non-existent words like smurt and crup, and we laugh at them.</t5466> <t5467>Sometimes he turns on the shortwave radio, and for a minute or two, to show he can do it, he plays Radio Free America in front of me.</t5467> <t5468>Then he turns it off again.</t5468> <t5469>“Damn Cubans,” he says.</t5469> <t5470>“All this crap about universal childcare.”</t5470>
<t5471>Sometimes, after the games, he sits on the floor next to my chair, holding my hand.</t5471> <t5472>His head is slightly below mine, so when he looks at me, he appears like a child.</t5472> <t5473>It must amuse him, this fake submission.</t5473>
<t5474>Oh, up there, says Gleninki.</t5474> <t5475>At the top, I mean the very top.</t5475>
<t5476>It's hard to think about this at times like these.</t5476>
<t5477>From time to time, I try to put myself in his place.</t5477> <t5478>I do this as a tactic, to predict in advance how his behavior towards me might be directed.</t5478> <t5479>It is hard for me to believe that I have any kind of power over him, but I do; despite it being ambiguous.</t5479> <t5480>Every now and then, even if it's blurry, I think I can see myself as he sees me.</t5480> <t5481>There are things he wants to prove to me, gifts he wants to give, services he wants to perform, and states of compassion he wants to inspire.</t5481>
<t5482>He wants it, very well.</t5482> <t5483>Especially after a few glasses of alcohol.</t5483>
<t5484>Sometimes he gets grumpy, other times he turns into a philosopher; or he wants to explain something, to justify himself.</t5484> <t5485>Like the other night.</t5485>
<t5486>The problem wasn't just about women, he says.</t5486> <t5487>The main issue was with men.</t5487> <t5488>There was nothing left for them anymore.</t5488>
<t5489>Nothing at all? I ask.</t5489> <t5490>But what they have...</t5490>
<t5491>There was nothing to be done for them, he says.</t5491>
<t5492>They could make money, I say, a bit shamelessly.</t5492> <t5493>Right now, I'm not afraid of him.</t5493> <t5494>It's hard to be afraid of a man sitting and watching you while you apply lotion to your hands.</t5494> <t5495>This lack of fear is dangerous.</t5495>
<t5496>This was not enough, he says.</t5496> <t5497>This is a very abstract thing.</t5497> <t5498>What I mean is, they had nothing left to do with women.</t5498>
<t5499>What do you mean? I say.</t5499> <t5500>What about all those porn corners, they were everywhere, they even made them mobile.</t5500>
<t5501>I'm not talking about sex, he says.</t5501> <t5502>That's just one aspect of it, sex was very easy.</t5502> <t5503>Everyone could buy it.</t5503> <t5504>There was nothing to strive for, nothing to fight for.</t5504> <t5505>We have the statistics from that time.</t5505> <t5506>Do you know what they complained about the most?</t5506> <t5507>A lack of feeling.</t5507> <t5508>Men had even started to turn their backs on sex.</t5508> <t5509>And on marriage too.</t5509>
<t5510>Do they feel it now? I ask.</t5510>
<t5511>Yes, he says, looking at me.</t5511> <t5512>They feel it.</t5512> <t5513>He stands up, comes to the chair I'm sitting on from around the table.</t5513> <t5514>He puts his hands on my shoulders, from behind.</t5514> <t5515>I can't see him.</t5515>
<t5516>I want to know what you're thinking, says the voice, from behind me.</t5516>
<t5517>I don't think much, I say softly.</t5517> <t5518>What she wants is closeness, but I can't give it to her.</t5518>
<t5519>There's not much point in thinking, is there? I say.</t5519> <t5520>What I think doesn't matter.</t5520>
<t5521>And that's why he can tell me things.</t5521>
<t5522>Come on, he says, squeezing my shoulders with his hands, I'm interested in your opinion.</t5522> <t5523>You're smart enough, you must have an opinion.</t5523>
<t5524>What about? I ask.</t5524>
<t5525>About what we are doing, he says.</t5525> <t5526>About how things are going.</t5526>
<t5527>I'm straining myself.</t5527> <t5528>I'm trying to clear my mind.</t5528> <t5529>I'm thinking of the sky, at night, when there is no moon.</t5529> <t5530>I have no idea, I say.</t5530>
<t5531>He sighs, relaxes his hands, but still leaves them on my shoulders.</t5531> <t5532>He knows what I'm thinking, anyway.</t5532>
<t5533>You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, he says.</t5533> <t5534>We thought we could do better.</t5534>
<t5535>"Better than this?" I say, in a low voice.</t5535> <t5536>How can he think this is better?</t5536>
<t5537>Better never means better for everyone, he says.</t5537> <t5538>It always means worse, for some.</t5538>
<t5539>I am lying flat, the humid air above me like a blanket.</t5539> <t5540>Like the earth.</t5540> <t5541>I wish it would rain.</t5541> <t5542>Even better, a storm, dark clouds, lightning, a noise that makes your eardrums shine.</t5542> <t5543>The electricity could go out.</t5543> <t5544>Then I could go down to the kitchen, say that I am scared, and sit in the kitchen with Rita and Cora; they would allow me to be scared because it is something they share, they would include me among them.</t5544> <t5545>There would be burning candles, we would watch our faces come and go in the sharp light vibrations, the white flashes coming from outside the windows.</t5545> <t5546>Oh my God, Cora would say.</t5546> <t5547>God, protect us.</t5547>
<t5548>The air would be cleaner and lighter from now on.</t5548>
<t5549>I'm looking up at the ceiling, at the circle of plaster flowers.</t5549> <t5550>Draw a circle, step inside, it will protect you.</t5550> <t5551>From the center hung a chandelier, and from the chandelier dangled a twisted piece of sheet.</t5551> <t5552>It was the place where the woman swung, very lightly, like a pendulum; like a child might swing, hanging from a tree branch.</t5552> <t5553>Then she was safe, completely protected.</t5553> <t5554>When Cora opened the door.</t5554> <t5555>Sometimes I still think she's here, with me.</t5555>
<t5556>I feel buried.</t5556>
<t5557>33</t5557>
<t5558>Late in the afternoon, the sky is hazy, yet the sun finds its way through and spreads everywhere with all its might, like bronze-colored dust.</t5558> <t5559>Glen and I are gliding along the street; we are a pair, another pair in front of us, and another pair across the way.</t5559> <t5560>We must look good from a distance: picturesque, like German milkmaids in a wallpaper motif, like a shelf full of ceramic salt and pepper shakers adorned with figures in old-time clothing, like a small fleet of swans or anything that repeats itself with at least a touch of elegance, despite the lack of variety.</t5560> <t5561>To dazzle the eyes, For the Eyes, after all, this show is for them.</t5561> <t5562>We are being sent to the Prayer Ceremony, to show how obedient and devout we are.</t5562>
<t5563>There isn't a single dandelion in sight, the lawns have been meticulously cleaned.</t5563> <t5564>I want one, just one, worthless and brazenly random, hard to dismiss and yellow like the sun all year round.</t5564> <t5565>Cheerful and ordinary, shining equally for everyone.</t5565> <t5566>We used to make rings from them, crowns and necklaces, and we would stain our fingers with their bitter milk.</t5566> <t5567>Or I would hold one under my daughter's chin: Do you like weddings?</t5567> <t5568>When we smelled them, pollen would get on our noses.</t5568> <t5569>(Or was it buttercups?) Or we would go to plant seeds: I can picture her running around the lawn, right here in front of me, three or four years old, holding one, waving it like a sparkler, a small stick of white fire, the air filled with tiny parachutes.</t5569> <t5570>Blow and tell the time.</t5570> <t5571>All that time, drifting away in the summer breeze.</t5571> <t5572>Though there were daisies for love, we played with those too.</t5572>
<t5573>We line up at the checkpoint to get our procedures done, in pairs and pairs and pairs, like students from a special girls' school who have been out on a walk and stayed outside for too long.</t5573> <t5574>We have stayed outside so long it feels like years have passed, so everything seems too big; legs, bodies, and along with them, clothes.</t5574> <t5575>We are like we are enchanted.</t5575> <t5576>I would like to believe it is a fairy tale.</t5576> <t5577>Yet we continue to be checked and keep walking in pairs.</t5577>
<t5578>After a while, we pass the Lilies and turn right, heading down towards the river.</t5578> <t5579>I wish I could go to the wide clearings by the riverbank, where we used to lie under the sun and where the bridges arched.</t5579> <t5580>If you follow the river far enough along its meandering curves, you will reach the sea; but really, what could one do there now?</t5580> <t5581>Collect shells, wander on slippery stones.</t5581>
<t5582>We are not going towards the river, though, we will not see the small domes of the buildings on that side, white with blue and gold embroideries, such a simple ornamentation.</t5582> <t5583>We are entering a more modern building, they have hung a massive cloth banner above its door - TODAY WOMEN'S PRAYER CEREMONY.</t5583> <t5584>The banner covers the building's old name, the name of an assassinated President.</t5584> <t5585>Under the red writing, there is another line in smaller letters, black, with the outlines of a winged eye on either side: GOD IS A NATIONAL RESOURCE.</t5585> <t5586>On either side of the door, there are those inevitable Guards, two pairs, a total of four, with their weapons at their sides, eyes looking forward.</t5586> <t5587>They are almost like store mannequins, with their straight hair and pressed uniforms and plaster-like stiff young faces.</t5587> <t5588>No pimply ones today.</t5588> <t5589>Each of them has light machine guns ready to fire for any dangerous or destructive action they think you might do inside.</t5589>
<t5590>The Prayer Ceremony that needs to be held in the covered courtyard with a rectangular area and a dormer window.</t5590> <t5591>This is not a Prayer Ceremony that encompasses the whole city; if it were, it would be held in a football stadium; it's just for this region.</t5591> <t5592>Rows of folding wooden chairs have been placed to the right, for the wives and daughters of high-ranking officials or officers, there isn't much difference between them.</t5592> <t5593>The upper galleries with concrete railings are for women of lower status; the Marthas, the Econowives in their multicolored striped dresses.</t5593> <t5594>It's not mandatory for them to attend the Prayer Ceremony, especially if they are on duty or have small children, yet it seems like the galleries will still be filled.</t5594> <t5595>Like a show or a circus, I suppose this is a form of entertainment.</t5595>
<t5596>Some of the spouses have already taken their places in their best embroidered blue dresses.</t5596> <t5597>As we walk two by two in our red dresses towards the places opposite them, we can feel their gazes on us.</t5597> <t5598>We are being watched, measured, and whispered about; we can feel this, just as we can feel ants running on our bare skin.</t5598>
<t5599>There are no chairs here.</t5599> <t5600>Our area is separated by a silky, braided, reddish cord, the kind that used to exist in cinemas to restrain customers.</t5600> <t5601>This cord separates and gathers us together, defines our boundaries, prevents us from spreading anything to others, and functions as a pen or coop for us; thus, we enter it, line up looking straight ahead, something we know very well how to do, then kneel on the concrete floor.</t5601>
<t5602>“Head to the back,” murmurs Gleninki.</t5602> <t5603>“We can talk more comfortably there.”</t5603> <t5604>With heads slightly bowed, as we kneel, I can hear a rustling sound coming from all around us, like the chirps of insects among the tall and dry grasses: a cloud of whispers.</t5604> <t5605>This is one of the places where we can exchange news more freely, passing it from one to another, making it difficult for them to identify who is speaking or to hear what is being said.</t5605> <t5606>Moreover, it doesn't suit them to interrupt the ceremony in front of the television cameras.</t5606>
<t5607>Gleninki nudges me with his elbow to get my attention, I lift my head, slowly and discreetly.</t5607> <t5608>From where we are kneeling, we can see the courtyard entrance where people are constantly streaming in very well.</t5608> <t5609>The person he wants me to see must be Janine, because there she is, paired with a new woman, the old one is gone; someone I don't recognize.</t5609> <t5610>Janine must have been assigned to a new house, a new duty in this case.</t5610> <t5611>Actually, it's still early for this, could there have been a problem with the breast milk?</t5611> <t5612>If there wasn't a fight over the child, this could be the only reason for her reassignment; these kinds of fights happen more often than thought.</t5612> <t5613>Once she gave birth to the child, she might have resisted giving it up.</t5613> <t5614>I can understand that.</t5614> <t5615>Her body under the red dress looks very thin, almost skeletal, moreover, she has lost that pregnancy glow.</t5615> <t5616>Her face is white and emaciated as if her vital essence has been drained.</t5616>
<t5617>“It was of no use, you know,” says Gleninki, from beside my head.</t5617> <t5618>“In the end, it was just a meat grinder.</t5618><t5619>”</t5619>
<t5620>She means Janine's baby, the one Janine felt inside her while going somewhere else.</t5620> <t5621>Angela baby.</t5621> <t5622>It was wrong to name her so quickly.</t5622> <t5623>I feel a discomfort in the pit of my stomach.</t5623> <t5624>Not discomfort, but an emptiness.</t5624> <t5625>I don't want to know what's wrong with her.</t5625> <t5626>"My God," I say.</t5626> <t5627>Enduring all this for nothing.</t5627> <t5628>Worse than nothing.</t5628>
<t5629>“The second baby,” says Gleninki.</t5629> <t5630>“If we don't count her own.</t5630> <t5631>She had a miscarriage at eight months, didn't you know?</t5631><t5632>”</t5632>
<t5633>We are watching Janine, shrouded in untouchability and bad luck, enter the cordoned-off area.</t5633> <t5634>She sees me, she must see me, but her gaze seems to pass right through me.</t5634> <t5635>No triumphant smile this time.</t5635> <t5636>She turns and kneels, now all I can see is her back and her slender, curved shoulders.</t5636>
<t5637>“She thinks it's her fault,” whispers Gleninki.</t5637> <t5638>“Two in a row.</t5638> <t5639>Because she is a sinner.</t5639> <t5640>They say she used a doctor, the baby wasn't from the Commander.</t5640><t5641>”</t5641>
<t5642>I can't say I know, otherwise Glen would wonder how I knew.</t5642> <t5643>As long as she has her ear to the ground, she's my only source for this kind of information; she has an astonishing amount of it.</t5643> <t5644>How did she find out about what happened to Janine?</t5644> <t5645>From the Marthas?</t5645> <t5646>Or from Janine's shopping partner?</t5646> <t5647>By listening to the Wives knitting behind closed doors while drinking tea and wine?</t5647> <t5648>If I do what she wants, would Serena Joy talk about me like that too?</t5648> <t5649>She agreed immediately, she didn't actually care, she was okay with anyone who had two legs and something good.</t5649> <t5650>They don't know what disgust is, they don't have our feelings.</t5650> <t5651>And the guests lean forward from their chairs, Oh my God, with horror and lust.</t5651> <t5652>How could she do it?</t5652> <t5653>Where? When?</t5653>
<t5654>Undoubtedly, just like what they did for Janine.</t5654> <t5655>"This is a terrible thing," I say.</t5655> <t5656>However, blaming herself for everything and deciding that the child's disabilities are her own fault is exactly the kind of behavior typical of Janine.</t5656> <t5657>But people will do anything rather than admit that their lives have no significance.</t5657> <t5658>Rather than saying they are useless, I mean.</t5658> <t5659>Unscripted.</t5659>
<t5660>One morning, while we were getting dressed, I noticed that Janine was still standing in her white cotton nightgown.</t5660> <t5661>She was just sitting on the edge of her bed.</t5661>
<t5662>I looked towards the place where the Aunts usually stood, at the double doors of the gym, to see if he noticed it too, but the Aunt was not there.</t5662> <t5663>By then, they had come to trust us quite a bit; sometimes they would leave us alone in the classroom, and occasionally, even for a few minutes, in the cafeteria.</t5663> <t5664>She had slipped away for a cigarette or a cup of coffee.</t5664>
<t5665>Look, I said to Alma, the owner of the bed next to mine.</t5665>
<t5666>Alma looked at Janine.</t5666> <t5667>Then we both walked towards her.</t5667> <t5668>Put on your clothes, Janine, said Alma, to Janine's white back.</t5668> <t5669>We don't want to get extra prayer punishment because of you.</t5669> <t5670>But Janine did not move.</t5670>
<t5671>By that time, Moira had also arrived.</t5671> <t5672>This was before she broke the beam for the second time.</t5672> <t5673>She was still limping because of what they did to her feet.</t5673> <t5674>She circled to the other side of the bed to see Janine's face.</t5674>
<t5675>Come here, she said to Alma and me.</t5675> <t5676>The others were also starting to gather, a small crowd had formed.</t5676> <t5677>Step back, Moira told them.</t5677> <t5678>Don't exaggerate the situation, what if he comes in now?</t5678>
<t5679>I was looking at Janine.</t5679> <t5680>Her eyes were open, but she couldn't even see me.</t5680> <t5681>Her eyes were round and large, her teeth exposed in a frozen grin.</t5681> <t5682>She was whispering something to herself through her smile and teeth.</t5682> <t5683>I had to lean in closer to her.</t5683>
<t5684>Hello, she said, but not to me.</t5684> <t5685>My name is Janine.</t5685> <t5686>I am your waitress this morning.</t5686> <t5687>May I bring you a cup of coffee to start?</t5687>
<t5688>My God, said Moira beside me.</t5688> <t5689>Don't swear in the name of God, said Alma.</t5689>
<t5690>Moira grabbed Janine by the shoulders and shook her.</t5690> <t5691>Get a grip, Janine, she said roughly.</t5691> <t5692>And don't use that word.</t5692>
<t5693>Janine smiled.</t5693> <t5694>Now, good day to you, she said.</t5694>
<t5695>Moira slapped him, twice, once forward and once backward.</t5695> <t5696>Come back here, she said.</t5696> <t5697>Come back here immediately!</t5697> <t5698>You can't stay there, you're not there anymore.</t5698> <t5699>It's all in the past.</t5699>
<t5700>Janine's smile froze.</t5700> <t5701>She brought her hand to her cheek.</t5701> <t5702>Why did you hit me? she said.</t5702> <t5703>Wasn't it good?</t5703> <t5704>I can bring another one.</t5704> <t5705>You didn't have to hit me.</t5705>
<t5706>Don't you know what they're going to do? said Moira.</t5706> <t5707>Her tone was low, but firm and determined.</t5707> <t5708>Look at me.</t5708> <t5709>My name is Moira, and this is the Red Center.</t5709> <t5710>Look at me.</t5710>
<t5711>Janine's eyes had started to gather attention.</t5711> <t5712>Moira? she said.</t5712> <t5713>I don't know anyone named Moira.</t5713>
<t5714>They won't send you to the infirmary, don't even think about it, said Moira.</t5714> <t5715>They won't go out of their way to treat you.</t5715> <t5716>They won't even bother sending you to the Colonies.</t5716> <t5717>You'd go much farther, they'd take you to the Chemistry Lab and put a bullet in your brain, that's all.</t5717> <t5718>Then they'd burn you with the garbage, just like an Unwoman.</t5718> <t5719>Give it up.</t5719>
<t5720>I want to go home, said Janine.</t5720> <t5721>She started to cry.</t5721>
<t5722>Oh my God, said Moira.</t5722> <t5723>That's enough.</t5723> <t5724>She will be here in a minute, believe me.</t5724> <t5725>Put on those damn clothes and shut up.</t5725>
<t5726>Janine continued to complain, but she also started to get up and get dressed.</t5726>
<t5727>"The next time you do this, I won't be here," Moira said to me, "you need to slap him like this."</t5727> <t5728>"You can't let him slip away."</t5728> <t5729>"This thing is contagious."</t5729>
<t5730>He must have been planning how to escape even back then.</t5730>
<t5731>34</t5731>
<t5732>The seating areas in the courtyard are full now; we rustle and wait.</t5732> <t5733>Finally, the Commander who will conduct this ceremony enters.</t5733> <t5734>He is balding, square-built, resembling an old football coach.</t5734> <t5735>He is wearing his uniform; a dignified black uniform adorned with rows of medals and decorations.</t5735> <t5736>It's hard not to be impressed, but I resist: I try to picture him in bed with his Wife and Handmaid, breeding madly, like a spawning salmon, pretending to enjoy it.</t5736> <t5737>When God said be fruitful and multiply, did He mean this man?</t5737>
<t5738>The commander descends the stairs towards the podium covered with red fabric, on which a large white-winged eye is embroidered.</t5738> <t5739>He briefly scans the surroundings, and our soft voices fall silent.</t5739> <t5740>He doesn't even have to raise his hands.</t5740> <t5741>His voice enters through the microphone and exits through the speakers, stripped of its low tones, thus extremely metallic, as if it were a sound produced not by his mouth or body, but by the speakers themselves.</t5741> <t5742>His voice is metal-colored, speaker-shaped.</t5742>
<t5743>“Today is Thanksgiving Day,” it begins.</t5743> <t5744>“A day of gratitude.</t5744><t5745>”</t5745>
<t5746>Throughout the speech filled with themes of victory and sacrifice, I find myself detaching.</t5746> <t5747>Then comes a long prayer, about worthless boats, followed by a hymn: "There is Peace in Gilead."</t5747><t5748></t5748>
<t5749>"There is a bomb in Gilead," Moira used to say.</t5749>
<t5750>The real event is starting now.</t5750> <t5751>Twenty Meler, who have just returned from the fronts, enter inside, accompanied by honor guards, having received new medals, one-two, one-two, they advance to the open area in the center with synchronized steps.</t5751> <t5752>Attention, at ease! And now, twenty girls in white timidly step forward, their mothers holding their arms.</t5752> <t5753>At this time, it is not the fathers but the mothers who give away the girls and help with the marriage arrangements.</t5753> <t5754>These marriages are undoubtedly arranged.</t5754> <t5755>These girls have not been allowed to be alone with a man for years; ever since we started these practices.</t5755>
<t5756>Are they old enough to remember something from the past: playing baseball, riding a bike in jeans and sneakers?</t5756> <t5757>Reading a book entirely on their own?</t5757> <t5758>Even if some are no more than fourteen - Politics, it starts them right away, not a moment to lose - they will still remember.</t5758> <t5759>Moreover, those who come after them will also remember, for three, four, or five years; but after that, no.</t5759> <t5760>They will always be in white, with girl groups; they will always remain silent.</t5760>
<t5761>We gave them more than we took, said the Commander.</t5761> <t5762>Think about the troubles they went through before.</t5762> <t5763>Don't you remember the bars for the lonely, the awkwardness of dating people they didn't know in high school?</t5763> <t5764>The meat market.</t5764> <t5765>Or that terrible chasm between those who could easily get a man and those who couldn't?</t5765> <t5766>Some were desperate, they starved themselves to lose weight or inflated their breasts with silicone, had their noses cut and reshaped.</t5766> <t5767>Think about the misery of humankind.</t5767>
<t5768>He waved his hand towards the pile of old magazines.</t5768> <t5769>They were always complaining.</t5769> <t5770>Complaining about this, complaining about that.</t5770> <t5771>Remember the ads in the Heart's Mail column, at thirty-five, a bright and attractive woman...</t5771> <t5772>Through this way, they would all find a man, no one would be left out in the cold.</t5772> <t5773>And then if they got married, they could be left with one or two children, the husband would take what he wanted and leave, disappearing without a trace, and the women would have to survive with the help of official institutions.</t5773> <t5774>If he didn't leave, he would keep beating them.</t5774> <t5775>If they had a job, they would put their children in daycare or leave them with a rough and ignorant woman, and they had to pay for it themselves, with their small miserable checks.</t5775> <t5776>The only measure of value for everyone was money, they had no respect as mothers.</t5776> <t5777>It's no wonder they withdraw from everything.</t5777> <t5778>In this way, they protect themselves and fulfill the requirements of their biological destiny.</t5778> <t5779>With full support and encouragement.</t5779> <t5780>Now, tell me.</t5780> <t5781>You are a smart person, I want to hear what you have to say.</t5781> <t5782>What did we overlook?</t5782>
<t5783>I said, love.</t5783>
<t5784>"Love?" said the Commander.</t5784> <t5785>"What kind of love?"</t5785> <t5786>"Falling in love," I said.</t5786>
<t5787>The commander looked at me with honest, childlike eyes.</t5787> <t5788>Ah, yes, he said.</t5788> <t5789>I had read the magazines, this is what they were putting forward, right?</t5789> <t5790>And look at these statistics, dear.</t5790> <t5791>Was it really worth it, to fall in love?</t5791> <t5792>Arranged marriages, if not better, work at least as well as the previous ones.</t5792>
<t5793>Love, said Aunt Lydia, with disgust.</t5793> <t5794>Don't let me catch you messing with this nonsense.</t5794> <t5795>No wandering around aimlessly here, girls.</t5795> <t5796>She wagged her finger at us.</t5796> <t5797>Love is not what matters.</t5797>
<t5798>Speaking in a historical context, those years were a complete anomaly, said the Commander.</t5798> <t5799>They only happened by accident; all we did was align everything with Nature's norms.</t5799>
<t5800>The Women's Prayer Ceremony is generally organized for such group marriages.</t5800><t5801>The men's ceremony is for military victories.</t5801><t5802>These were, respectively, the things we should be most happy about.</t5802><t5803>However, sometimes this ceremony was also held for a nun who had renounced her faith.</t5803><t5804>Most of these happened earlier, during the period when they were gathering the nuns, but even today they still find one or two, digging up the underground where they hide like moles.</t5804><t5805>They don't exactly give a different impression: they are dazed by the bright light with their myopic eyes.</t5805><t5806>The elderly nuns are sent to the Colonies without delay, but they try to convert the young and fertile ones from their faith, and when they succeed, we all gather to watch them go through this ceremony, renouncing their vows of celibacy and sacrificing it for the benefit of society.</t5806><t5807>They kneel and the Commander prays and they take the red veil, just as we have done.</t5807><t5808>Still, they are not allowed to become Wives; they are considered too dangerous for such a powerful position.</t5808><t5809>The scent of witchcraft clings to them, the scent of something mysterious and exotic; despite their scrubbing and the marks of the rods on their soles and the time spent in the cell, this scent remains.</t5809><t5810>These marks always remain on their soles, they have always done this, the rumor goes: they don't let go of a person easily.</t5810><t5811>Most of the nuns choose the Colonies instead, none of us want to end up with one of them as a shopping partner.</t5811><t5812>They are more broken than we are; it is hard to feel comfortable around them.</t5812>
<t5813>The mothers had taken their daughters with white veils to their places and now had returned to their chairs.</t5813> <t5814>There were light sobs among them, mutual arm nudges and hand holdings, using handkerchiefs just for show.</t5814> <t5815>The commander continues with the ceremony:</t5815>
<t5816>“I desire that women adorn themselves with modest clothing,” he says.</t5816> <t5817>“With shamefacedness and sobriety; not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive costumes; but (for they have become women professing godliness) with good works.</t5817>
<t5818>“Let a woman learn quietly with full submission.”</t5818> <t5819>Here, he scans us with his eyes.</t5819> <t5820>“Completely,” he repeats.</t5820>
<t5821>“However, I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.</t5821>
<t5822>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</t5822>
<t5823>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in transgression.</t5823>
<t5824>However, she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with propriety.</t5824><t5825>”</t5825>
<t5826>I'm thinking that having a child is a way to be saved.</t5826> <t5827>In the previous period, I wonder what we thought would save us?</t5827>
<t5828>“The Wives should have told them,” Gleninki murmurs.</t5828> <t5829>“While swimming in Sherry.” She means the part about moderation.</t5829> <t5830>It’s safe to talk again; the Commander has finished the main part of the ceremony; now, they’re putting on the rings and lifting the veils.</t5830> <t5831>Ugh, I think to myself.</t5831> <t5832>Look well, because now it’s too late.</t5832> <t5833>Later, the Angels will be entitled to Handmaids, especially if their new Wives can’t produce children.</t5833> <t5834>However, girls, you’re nailed to where you are.</t5834> <t5835>What you get is limited to what you see.</t5835> <t5836>But you’re not expected to love them.</t5836> <t5837>You’ll understand this soon enough.</t5837> <t5838>Just perform your duty silently.</t5838> <t5839>When in doubt, when you lie on your back, you’re allowed to look at the ceiling.</t5839> <t5840>Who knows what you’ll see up there?</t5840> <t5841>Funeral wreaths and angels, constellations of dust, stars or others, puzzles left by spiders.</t5841> <t5842>There’s always something to occupy an inquisitive mind.</t5842>
<t5843>Is there something, dear? the old joke continues.</t5843>
<t5844>Hey, why?</t5844>
<t5845>You moved.</t5845>
<t5846>Don't move.</t5846>
<t5847>The goal we aim for, says Aunt Lydia, is to create a spirit of camaraderie among women.</t5847> <t5848>We must all strive together.</t5848>
<t5849>To hell with your camaraderie, says Moira, from the hole in the toilet stall.</t5849> <t5850>Keep pushing, Aunt Lydia, as they used to say.</t5850> <t5851>How much would you bet that she made Janine kneel?</t5851> <t5852>Why do you think they go to her office?</t5852> <t5853>I bet Aunt Lydia is constantly working on her, that scrawny, old, withered—</t5853>
<t5854>Moira! I say.</t5854>
<t5855>What about Moira? she whispers.</t5855> <t5856>I know you're thinking about it.</t5856>
<t5857>It's not right to talk like this at all, I say, still feeling the urge to giggle.</t5857> <t5858>But back then, I was pretending to myself that we still needed to maintain something resembling dignity.</t5858>
<t5859>You have always been a coward, says Moira, lovingly though.</t5859> <t5860>It feels so good.</t5860> <t5861>Really.</t5861>
<t5862>You were right, now I understand this as I kneel on this undeniably hard ground, listening to the ceremony that continues in a low and monotonous voice.</t5862> <t5863>There is something empowering about whispering the explicit remarks about the rulers from ear to ear.</t5863> <t5864>Moreover, there is something pleasant, mischievous, mysterious, forbidden, and exciting.</t5864> <t5865>Like magic, so to speak.</t5865> <t5866>It brings them down, reduces them to a common denominator that can be dealt with.</t5866> <t5867>Someone unknown had scratched on the wall of the shower cabin: Aunt Lydia is sulking.</t5867> <t5868>It was like a flag waving from the top of a hill in rebellion.</t5868> <t5869>Even the mere idea that Aunt Lydia did something was encouraging in itself.</t5869>
<t5870>Therefore, now I bring to my mind the ultimate serious grumblings and sweatings that will take place among these Angels and dried white brides, facing them with their damp hairs; or, better yet, their disgraceful failures, tools turned into three-week-old carrots, painful, clumsy writhings on cold and unresponsive flesh like uncooked fish.</t5870>
<t5871>At the end of the ceremony, as we were leaving, Gleninki says in that soft, penetrating whisper of hers: "We know you met with him alone.</t5871><t5872>"</t5872>
<t5873>“With whom?” I say, resisting the urge to look at him.</t5873> <t5874>I know who it is.</t5874>
<t5875>"With your Commander," he says.</t5875> <t5876>"We have known from the very beginning."</t5876> <t5877>I ask how they found out.</t5877>
<t5878>“We learned it, didn't we,” he says.</t5878> <t5879>“What does he want?</t5879> <t5880>A perverted love?</t5880><t5881>”</t5881>
<t5882>It would be difficult to explain what she wanted, because I still hadn't found a name for it.</t5882> <t5883>How can I explain what is really going on between us?</t5883> <t5884>She would laugh, for one.</t5884> <t5885>For me, saying "In a way," is easier.</t5885> <t5886>In this, at least, there is the weight of trying.</t5886>
<t5887>He is thinking about this.</t5887> <t5888>"If you knew how many wanted it," he says, "you would be surprised.</t5888><t5889>"</t5889>
<t5890>“There is nothing I can do,” I say.</t5890> <t5891>“I can't say I won't come.”</t5891> <t5892>He must know this.</t5892>
<t5893>Now we are on the sidewalk and it is not safe to talk, we are both too close to the others and the protective murmur of the crowd has ceased.</t5893> <t5894>We walk quietly, lingering at the back, until finally, "Of course you can't say that.</t5894> <t5895>Still, find out and tell us," until we are convinced that you can say.</t5895>
<t5896>"What will I find?" I say.</t5896>
<t5897>I feel it more than I see her slightly turning her head.</t5897> <t5898>"Everything you can find.</t5898><t5899>"</t5899>
<t5900>35</t5900>
<t5901>Now there is a space that needs to be filled in the very warm air of my room, and also a time; a space-time, between here and now and there and then, culminating with dinner.</t5901> <t5902>The tray being carried up the stairs as if for a bedridden patient.</t5902> <t5903>A bedridden person, someone invalidated.</t5903> <t5904>No valid passport.</t5904> <t5905>No exit.</t5905>
<t5906>This is what happened on the day we tried to cross the border, with our new passports that claimed we were not who we were: for example, Luke had never been divorced, so according to the new laws, our union was legal.</t5906>
<t5907>After we explained the picnic situation and he himself peeked inside the car and saw our daughter sleeping among the old fabric animals, the man went inside with our passports.</t5907> <t5908>Luke tapped my arm and, as if wanting to get some air, stepped out of the car and watched the man through the immigration office window.</t5908> <t5909>I stayed in the car.</t5909> <t5910>To calm myself, I lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, a long breath that provided artificial relief.</t5910> <t5911>By that time, I was watching two soldiers in unusual uniforms, who were starting to become familiar; they were idly standing in front of the yellow-black striped lift-and-lower barrier.</t5911> <t5912>They weren't doing much.</t5912> <t5913>One was watching a flock of birds, seagulls, that flew up, turned, and then landed again on the railings of the bridge on the other side.</t5913> <t5914>While watching him, I also watched the birds.</t5914> <t5915>Everything was in its usual color, just brighter.</t5915>
<t5916>Everything will go well, I said, I prayed silently.</t5916> <t5917>Oh, please let it go well.</t5917> <t5918>Let's cross over, let's go to the other side.</t5918> <t5919>Just this time, then I'll do whatever it takes.</t5919> <t5920>For the one listening to this, whoever it may be, I will never know if what I think I can do will be of any use, or even if it will attract any interest.</t5920>
<t5921>Then Luke got into the car, hastily, started the engine and put it in reverse.</t5921> <t5922>He was making a phone call, he said.</t5922> <t5923>And then he started driving very fast, then we entered that dirt road and the forest, and we jumped out of the car and started running.</t5923> <t5924>A cabin, to hide, a boat, I don't know what we were thinking.</t5924> <t5925>He said the passports were perfect and we had very little time to make a plan.</t5925> <t5926>Maybe he had a plan, some kind of map in his mind.</t5926> <t5927>As for me, I was just running: further, further away.</t5927>
<t5928>I don't want to be telling this story.</t5928>
<t5929>I don't actually have to explain.</t5929> <t5930>I don't have to explain anything, neither to myself nor to anyone else.</t5930> <t5931>I can just sit here, in peace.</t5931> <t5932>I can withdraw.</t5932> <t5933>A person can go so far within themselves, so far down and back, that they can never be brought out again.</t5933>
<t5934>Don't let the bastards grind you down.</t5934> <t5935>It didn't help her at all.</t5935>
<t5936>Why struggle?</t5936>
<t5937>It will never work.</t5937>
<t5938>Love? said the Commander.</t5938>
<t5939>This is better.</t5939> <t5940>Something I know.</t5940> <t5941>We can talk about this.</t5941>
<t5942>To fall in love, I said.</t5942> <t5943>To fall into love, we all used to do it back then, in one way or another.</t5943> <t5944>How could she have taken it so lightly?</t5944> <t5945>Had she even belittled it?</t5945> <t5946>As if it were insignificant to us, a show, a whim.</t5946> <t5947>On the contrary, it was laborious.</t5947> <t5948>It was the fundamental thing; it was the way to understand yourself; if it never happened to you, not even once, it meant you were mutated, a creature from the outside world.</t5948> <t5949>Everyone knew this.</t5949>
<t5950>We used to say, falling in love; my heart fell for him.</t5950> <t5951>We were the women who fell.</t5951> <t5952>We believed in this downward movement: so affectionate, like flying, but at the same time so frightening, so extraordinary, so unexpected.</t5952> <t5953>They used to say God is love, but we had reversed this, and love, like Heaven, was right within our reach.</t5953> <t5954>The harder it was to love that special man next to us, the more we believed in Love, abstract and whole.</t5954> <t5955>We were always waiting for its embodiment.</t5955> <t5956>For this word to take on flesh and blood.</t5956>
<t5957>Sometimes this would happen, for a while.</t5957> <t5958>This kind of love comes and goes and later it is hard to remember, like pain.</t5958> <t5959>One day you look at that man and think, I loved you, but the sentence is in the past tense and a sense of curiosity fills you, because what you did was surprising, doubtful, and foolish.</t5959> <t5960>Moreover, you understand why your friends, back then, avoided this topic.</t5960>
<t5961>Remembering this is quite comforting now.</t5961>
<t5962>On the other hand, sometimes, while still in love, while still falling in love, you would wake up in the middle of the night, moonlight seeping through the window and hitting their sleeping face, making the shadows in their eye sockets more hollow and deep than in daylight, and you would think.</t5962> <t5963>Who knows what they are doing, on their own or with other men?</t5963> <t5964>Who can know what they are saying or where they might possibly go?</t5964> <t5965>Who can truly tell what they are?</t5965> <t5966>When they are in their everyday appearance.</t5966>
<t5967>Back then, you might have thought: What if they don't love me?</t5967>
<t5968>Or you would remember the stories you read in the newspapers, about women found in ditches or forests or in abandoned rental rooms' refrigerators -often women, but sometimes men or, worst of all, children- with their clothes on or naked, sexually assaulted or not; but in any case, murdered.</t5968> <t5969>There were places you didn't want to walk, precautions you took with window or door locks, drawing the curtains and leaving the lights on.</t5969> <t5970>These things you did were like prayers; you did them and thought they would protect you.</t5970> <t5971>And most of the time, they did protect you.</t5971> <t5972>Or something had protected you; you could infer this from the fact that you were still alive.</t5972>
<t5973>However, all of this was valid for the night and had nothing to do with the man you loved, at least during the day.</t5973> <t5974>You wanted it to work out with this man, to reach a solution.</t5974> <t5975>The solution was also something you did to maintain the shape of your body, for that man.</t5975> <t5976>If you found enough solutions, maybe the man would do the same.</t5976> <t5977>Maybe, you could reach a conclusion together, as if you both were a solvable puzzle; otherwise, one of you, most likely the man, would take his drug-addicted body along and pull away in his own orbit, leaving you to face a bad withdrawal; the only thing you could do to lessen its effect is to exercise.</t5977> <t5978>If you didn't reach a conclusion with him, it was because one of your attitudes was wrong.</t5978> <t5979>It was believed that everything happening in your life stemmed from a positive or negative force emanating from your mind.</t5979>
<t5980>If you don't like it, change it, we would say to each other and to ourselves.</t5980> <t5981>And so we would change that man, with another.</t5981> <t5982>We were sure that change was always for the better.</t5982> <t5983>We were revisionists; what we revised was ourselves.</t5983>
<t5984>It's strange to remember how we used to think, as if everything was at our command, as if there was no contingency, no limits; as if we were free to shape and reshape the ever-expanding parameters of our lives forever.</t5984> <t5985>I was like that too, I did the same.</t5985> <t5986>Luke was not the first man for me, moreover, he might not have been the last either.</t5986> <t5987>If it hadn't been frozen this way.</t5987> <t5988>In time, in the middle of the air, among those trees of the past, in the act of falling, if it hadn't been motionlessly stopped.</t5988>
<t5989>In the past, they used to send a small package containing belongings: the things that were with the person when they died.</t5989> <t5990>This is what they did during wartime, my mother would say.</t5990><t5991>'</t5991> <t5992>I wonder how long you were expected to mourn, and what would they say?</t5992> <t5993>Dedicate your existence to the beloved.</t5993> <t5994>And it was so, the beloved.</t5994> <t5995>One.</t5995>
<t5996>It is, I say.</t5996> <t5997>It is, it is, just three letters, you stupid idiot, can't you manage to remember, even such a short word?</t5997>
<t5998>I wipe my face with the sleeve of my dress.</t5998> <t5999>Once, I wouldn't do this for fear of staining it, but now nothing happens.</t5999> <t6000>The expression on my face, whatever it is that I cannot see, is real.</t6000> <t6001>You will have to forgive me.</t6001> <t6002>I am a refugee from the past, going over the traditions and customs of the existence I left behind or was forced to leave behind, like other refugees.</t6002> <t6003>And from here, it looks entirely extraordinary and pleasant, and I am just as obsessed with this existence.</t6003> <t6004>Like a White Russian drinking tea in Paris, left alone on a deserted island in the twentieth century, I steer backward, trying to rediscover those distant paths; I become overly sentimental, I lose myself.</t6004> <t6005>I let my tears flow.</t6005> <t6006>This is what happens, not crying.</t6006> <t6007>Sitting in this chair, I leak water like a sponge.</t6007>
<t6008>So.</t6008> <t6009>Waiting longer.</t6009> <t6010>The Waiting Woman: that's what they used to call those stores where you could buy maternity dresses.</t6010> <t6011>The waiting woman is more like someone researching a person waiting at a train station.</t6011> <t6012>Waiting is also a place: it is where you wait.</t6012> <t6013>For me, waiting is this room.</t6013> <t6014>I am a void, here, between parentheses.</t6014> <t6015>Among other people.</t6015>
<t6016>Someone is knocking on my door.</t6016> <t6017>It must be Cora with the tray.</t6017>
<t6018>But no, it's not that.</t6018> <t6019>"I brought this for you," says Serena</t6019>
<t6020>Joy.</t6020>
<t6021>Then I lift my head and look around, and I get up from my chair and approach her.</t6021> <t6022>She is holding a Polaroid picture, square and shiny.</t6022> <t6023>So they still make them, these kinds of cameras.</t6023> <t6024>Moreover, there will be family albums, with all the children in them; though there will never be a Handmaid.</t6024> <t6025>From the perspective of future history, this kind, that is, we will be invisible.</t6025> <t6026>Still, there will indeed be children in them, downstairs, rummaging in the sideboard and waiting to be born for the Wives to look at.</t6026>
<t6027>“It can only stay with you for a minute,” says Serena Joy, her voice low and as if sharing a crime.</t6027> <t6028>“I must take it back before they notice it's missing.</t6028><t6029>”</t6029>
<t6030>It must have been a Martha who obtained this for him.</t6030> <t6031>In this case, it means there is a network among the Marthas, with something in it for them as well.</t6031> <t6032>It's nice to learn this.</t6032>
<t6033>I take the picture from him, and I turn it to see it properly.</t6033> <t6034>Is that really him, could he really be like this?</t6034> <t6035>My treasure.</t6035>
<t6036>It has grown very long and changed.</t6036> <t6037>Now she is smiling a little, how quickly, as if dressed in her white dress for an old-time First Communion.</t6037>
<t6038>Time hasn't just stood still.</t6038> <t6039>It washed over me and carried me away, as if I were a woman made of sand left too close to the water by a careless child.</t6039> <t6040>In his eyes, I was a silhouette.</t6040> <t6041>Now I am merely a shadow, far behind the bright surface of this photograph.</t6041> <t6042>Like the shadows of dead mothers, a shadow of a shadow.</t6042> <t6043>You can see it in his eyes: I am not there.</t6043>
<t6044>But there it is, with its white dress.</t6044> <t6045>It grows and lives.</t6045> <t6046>Isn't this a beautiful thing?</t6046> <t6047>A blessing?</t6047>
<t6048>Still, I can't stand this, being erased like this.</t6048> <t6049>It would have been better if it had brought me nothing.</t6049>
<t6050>I am sitting at the small table eating creamy cornflakes with a fork.</t6050> <t6051>I have a fork and a spoon, but never a knife.</t6051> <t6052>When meat is served, they cut it for me as if I have no hand skills or teeth.</t6052> <t6053>However, I have both.</t6053> <t6054>That's precisely why I am not given a knife.</t6054>
<t6055>36</t6055>
<t6056>Knocking on the door, I hear his voice, adjust my face, and enter.</t6056> <t6057>He is standing by the fireplace; he has an almost empty drink glass in his hand.</t6057> <t6058>He usually waits for me to arrive before starting on the hard liquor; although I know they had wine with dinner.</t6058> <t6059>His face is a bit flushed.</t6059> <t6060>I'm trying to figure out how much he has drunk.</t6060>
<t6061>“Hello,” he says.</t6061> <t6062>“Let's see how our sweet little one is doing this evening?</t6062><t6063>”</t6063>
<t6064>I can say that I drank a few sips of the care with which he created and directed his smile.</t6064> <t6065>His politeness is evident.</t6065> <t6066>“I’m fine,” I say.</t6066> <t6067>“Are you ready for a little excitement?</t6067><t6068>”</t6068>
<t6069>“Pardon?” I say.</t6069> <t6070>I sense the shyness behind this move, an uncertainty about how far and in which direction to go with me.</t6070>
<t6071>“I have a little surprise for you tonight,” he says.</t6071> <t6072>He laughs; it's more of an uncontrollable laughter.</t6072> <t6073>This evening, I realize that everything is small.</t6073> <t6074>He wants to make things smaller, including me.</t6074> <t6075>“Something you'll like.</t6075><t6076>”</t6076>
<t6077>“What is it?” I say.</t6077> <t6078>“Chinese checkers?”</t6078> <t6079>I can show this much audacity; he seems to like these, especially after a drink or two.</t6079> <t6080>He prefers me to be flying.</t6080>
<t6081>"Something better," he says, trying to create suspense.</t6081>
<t6082>“I am getting impatient.</t6082><t6083>”</t6083>
<t6084>“Good,” he says.</t6084> <t6085>He goes to his desk and rummages through a drawer.</t6085> <t6086>Then, holding one hand behind his back, he comes towards me.</t6086> <t6087>“Guess,” he says.</t6087>
<t6088>"Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?" I ask.</t6088>
<t6089>“Ah, animal,” he says with mocking seriousness.</t6089> <t6090>“I would definitely call it an animal if it were up to me.”</t6090> <t6091>He extends his hand behind him.</t6091> <t6092>Judging by the appearance, he is holding a handful of lilac and pink feathers.</t6092> <t6093>Now he shakes and opens them.</t6093> <t6094>It is a garment, actually, a woman's garment: It even has a bra for the breasts, covered with purple glitter.</t6094> <t6095>The glitter I mean are small stars.</t6095> <t6096>The feathers are around and above the hips.</t6096> <t6097>So my guess about the corset was not wrong.</t6097>
<t6098>I wonder where you found it.</t6098> <t6099>All clothes of this kind should have been destroyed.</t6099> <t6100>I remember seeing this on television, in the new clips shot from one city to another.</t6100> <t6101>In New York, this was called the Manhattan Representation.</t6101> <t6102>Bonfires were lit in Times Square, with crowds singing around them, women raising their arms to the sky in gratitude when they felt the cameras were on them, young men with well-chiseled stone faces throwing things into the flames, armfuls of silk and nylon and faux fur, lime green, red, violet; black satin, gold lamé, shiny silver; bikini panties, see-through bras with pink satin hearts sewn to cover the nipples.</t6102> <t6103>And the manufacturers and importers and sellers were kneeling, repenting in front of the public, their funny paper hats resembling student dunce caps, with SHAME written on them in red.</t6103>
<t6104>However, some items must have escaped burning; it was unlikely they could seize everything.</t6104> <t6105>He must have found this the same way he obtained the magazines, not honestly: it reeks of the black market.</t6105> <t6106>Moreover, it's not even new, previously worn, with the fabric under the armpits wrinkled and slightly stained, with another woman's sweat.</t6106>
<t6107>“I had to guess the measurement,” he says.</t6107> <t6108>“I hope it fits.</t6108><t6109>”</t6109>
<t6110>“You expect me to wear this?” I say.</t6110> <t6111>I know my voice comes out prudish and disapproving.</t6111> <t6112>There is something alluring about this idea.</t6112> <t6113>I have never worn anything so outrageous, bright, and theatrical; theatrical, that's the right word; it must be an old theater costume or something from a now-defunct nightclub show; the closest thing I've worn to this was a swimsuit and a peach-colored lace camisole set that Luke once bought for me.</t6113> <t6114>Still, there is a seductiveness in this, it carries the charm of childish dressing up.</t6114> <t6115>Besides, it would be quite flashy, an insult to the Aunts, quite sinful, quite free.</t6115> <t6116>Freedom, like everything else, is relative.</t6116>
<t6117>"Okay," I say, trying not to look too eager.</t6117> <t6118>I want to make him feel like I'm doing him a favor.</t6118> <t6119>Now we can get to the point, to his deep-seated true desire.</t6119> <t6120>Does he have a small whip hidden behind the door?</t6120> <t6121>Will he ask me to take off my torture boots and bend over the table, or will he bend over himself?</t6121>
<t6122>“This is a disguise,” he says.</t6122> <t6123>“You will also need to put on makeup; I got some things for that.</t6123> <t6124>You can never get in without it.</t6124><t6125>”</t6125>
<t6126>"Where to?" I ask.</t6126>
<t6127>“I'm taking you out tonight.</t6127><t6128>”</t6128>
<t6129>“Outside?”</t6129> <t6130>This is an archaic expression.</t6130> <t6131>There is absolutely no place anymore for a man to take a woman out.</t6131> <t6132>“Out of here,” he says.</t6132>
<t6133>I know without saying that what he suggests is risky, for him, but especially for me; still, I want to go out.</t6133> <t6134>I want anything that will break the monotony, that can reverse the perceived respectable order of things.</t6134>
<t6135>I tell him that I don't want him to watch me while I'm wearing this thing; I'm still shy in front of him about showing my body.</t6135> <t6136>He says he'll turn around and he does, I take off my shoes, socks, and cotton underwear and put on the furry ones, under my dress.</t6136> <t6137>Then I take off the dress itself and throw the thin gilded fabric straps over my shoulders.</t6137> <t6138>There are also shoes, oddly high-heeled, lilac-colored.</t6138> <t6139>None of them fit perfectly, the shoes are a bit big, the chest of the dress is too tight, but it will do.</t6139>
<t6140>“Here,” I say, and he turns around.</t6140> <t6141>I feel like an idiot; I want to see myself in a mirror.</t6141> <t6142>“Nice,” he says.</t6142> <t6143>“Now your face too.</t6143><t6144>”</t6144>
<t6145>All that’s in the drawer are an old, melted lipstick that smells like artificial grapes, a few eyeliners, and mascara.</t6145> <t6146>There’s no eyeshadow or blush.</t6146> <t6147>For a moment, I think I won’t remember how to do it; my first attempt with the eyeliner leaves a black sooty smudge on my eyelids, as if I’ve been in a fight; but I wipe it off with some hand lotion from vegetable oil and try again.</t6147> <t6148>I dab a little lipstick on my cheekbones and blend it with my fingers.</t6148> <t6149>While I’m doing all this, he holds a large silver hand mirror for me.</t6149> <t6150>I realize it belongs to Serena Joy.</t6150> <t6151>He must have borrowed it from her room.</t6151> <t6152>There’s nothing I can do with my hair.</t6152>
<t6153>“Extraordinary,” he says.</t6153> <t6154>When everything is over, he looks quite excited; as if we are preparing for a party.</t6154>
<t6155>He goes to the wardrobe and takes out a cloak, hooded.</t6155> <t6156>Light blue, the color of the Wives.</t6156> <t6157>This must be Serena's.</t6157>
<t6158>“Pull the hood down to your face,” he says.</t6158> <t6159>“Be careful not to smudge your makeup.</t6159> <t6160>This is to pass through the checkpoints.</t6160><t6161>”</t6161>
<t6162>“But what about my access card?” I say.</t6162>
<t6163>“Don't worry about it,” he says.</t6163> <t6164>“I got one for you.”</t6164><t6165>”</t6165>
<t6166>And so, we set off.</t6166>
<t6167>Together, we slip through the streets that are beginning to darken.</t6167> <t6168>Commander is holding my right hand as if we were teenagers in the cinema.</t6168> <t6169>I wrap the sky-blue cloak tightly around my body, as a good Wife should.</t6169> <t6170>Through the tunnel formed by the hood, I can see the back of Nick's head.</t6170> <t6171>His hat is straight, he sits upright, his neck straight, entirely erect.</t6171> <t6172>His posture does not acknowledge my existence, or is it just my impression?</t6172> <t6173>Does he know what's under this cloak, did he provide it?</t6173> <t6174>If he provided it, does it make him angry, desirous, jealous, or at least affected?</t6174> <t6175>We have something in common with him; we are both considered invisible, we are both servants.</t6175> <t6176>I wonder if he knows this.</t6176> <t6177>When he opened the door for the Commander and then for me, I tried to catch his gaze, to make him look at me, but he acted as if he hadn't seen me.</t6177> <t6178>Why not?</t6178> <t6179>It's an easy task for him, carrying small messages, doing small favors; well, there's no point in risking that, really.</t6179>
<t6180>Checkpoints are not a problem at all, everything is going as smoothly as the Commander said it would, despite my rapid heartbeat and throbbing head.</t6180> <t6181>Scared rabbit, Moira would say.</t6181>
<t6182>After passing the second checkpoint, Nick asks, "Is this the place, Sir?" and the Commander replies, "Yes."</t6182>
<t6183>The car stops and the Commander says, "Now I have to ask you to lie down on the ground."</t6183>
<t6184>“To the ground?” I say.</t6184><t6185>'</t6185>
<t6186>“We need to pass through the garden gate,” he says, as if that means something to me.</t6186> <t6187>I tried to ask where we were going, but he said he wanted to surprise me.</t6187> <t6188>“Wives are not allowed to enter.</t6188><t6189>”</t6189>
<t6190>Thus, I flatten myself and the car starts moving again, for the next few minutes I see nothing.</t6190> <t6191>It's suffocatingly hot under the cloak.</t6191> <t6192>It's a winter cloak, not a summer cotton one, and it smells of mothballs.</t6192> <t6193>He must have borrowed it from the storeroom, knowing Serena wouldn't notice.</t6193> <t6194>He has respectfully pulled his feet back to make room for me.</t6194> <t6195>Nevertheless, my forehead touches his shoes.</t6195> <t6196>I've never been this close to his shoes before.</t6196> <t6197>They're hard and matte, like insect shells: black, painted, mysterious.</t6197> <t6198>They seem to have nothing to do with feet.</t6198>
<t6199>We are passing through another checkpoint.</t6199> <t6200>I hear official, respectful voices and the electric window going up and down to show the transit papers.</t6200> <t6201>This time, they won't show mine, the one that is supposed to be mine, since I officially don't exist anymore.</t6201>
<t6202>Then the car moves and stops again, and the Commander helps me to stand up.</t6202>
<t6203>“We must act quickly,” he says.</t6203> <t6204>“This is the back entrance.</t6204> <t6205>You must leave the cloak with Nick.</t6205> <t6206>At the usual time,” he says to Nick finally.</t6206> <t6207>So, this is something he has done before.</t6207>
<t6208>He is helping me take off the pilgrims; the car door is open now.</t6208> <t6209>I almost feel the air on my bare skin and realize that I am sweating.</t6209> <t6210>As I turn to close the car door, I can see Nick looking at me through the mirror.</t6210> <t6211>Now he sees me.</t6211> <t6212>The meaning I read in his eyes—is it contempt, indifference, or is this just what he expects from me?</t6212>
<t6213>We are in the alley behind a red brick and quite modern building.</t6213> <t6214>A pile of empty tin cans is placed outside, next to the door; there is a smell of rotting fried chicken in the air.</t6214> <t6215>The Commander has the key to the flat, gray, and wall-flush door, which I think is made of steel.</t6215> <t6216>Inside, there is a concrete block corridor illuminated by fluorescent overhead lights; a kind of functional tunnel.</t6216>
<t6217>“Here,” says the Commander.</t6217> <t6218>He attaches a purple tag to my wrist with an elastic band, like the tags used for luggage at the airport.</t6218> <t6219>“If anyone asks, you say you’ve been rented for the evening,” he says.</t6219> <t6220>He grabs me by the upper part of my bare arm and directs me forward.</t6220> <t6221>What I want is a mirror; I wonder if my lipstick is appropriate, if my hair looks too silly, too messy.</t6221> <t6222>I must look terrible under a light.</t6222> <t6223>Though it’s too late now.</t6223> <t6224>Fool, says Moira.</t6224>
<t6225>37</t6225>
<t6226>We walk along the corridor, pass through another dull gray door, and this time walk along another corridor that is slightly lit and carpeted in a mushroom-colored, brownish-pink hue.</t6226> <t6227>There are numbered doors opening into this hall: one hundred one, one hundred two, like counting in a storm to understand how close the lightning is to you.</t6227> <t6228>So, this is a hotel.</t6228> <t6229>Laughter is coming from behind one of the doors, from a man and a woman.</t6229> <t6230>It's been a long time since I heard these sounds.</t6230>
<t6231>We step into a central courtyard.</t6231> <t6232>It is spacious and also high: it rises several stories up to the skylight at the top.</t6232> <t6233>In the middle, there is a fountain, a round fountain spraying water in the shape of a dandelion gone to seed.</t6233> <t6234>Here and there, flowers in pots and budding trees, vines hanging from balconies.</t6234> <t6235>Oval-shaped glass elevators glide up and down the walls like giant snails.</t6235>
<t6236>I know where I am.</t6236> <t6237>I had been here before: with Luke, in the evenings, a long time ago.</t6237> <t6238>It was a hotel, that evening.</t6238> <t6239>Now it is full of women.</t6239>
<t6240>I stand still and watch them.</t6240> <t6241>I can watch, here, I can look around, there are no white wings to block me.</t6241> <t6242>My head, freed from them, feels unusually light to me; as if a burden or a weight has been lifted from it.</t6242>
<t6243>The women are sitting, lying down, walking around, leaning on each other.</t6243> <t6244>There are men mixed among them, many men, but with their dark uniforms or clothes, they resemble each other so much that they only form a kind of background.</t6244> <t6245>On the other hand, the women are dressed in tropical, bright, festival outfits of all kinds.</t6245> <t6246>Some are dressed like me, feathered and glittery, with dresses that have stripes from the hips and end just above the breasts.</t6246> <t6247>Some are wearing old-fashioned lingerie, short nightgowns, fantasy pajamas, familiar sheer robes.</t6247> <t6248>Some are in swimsuits, one-piece or bikinis; I see someone wearing a lacy thing made of large comb-like shells covering her nipples.</t6248> <t6249>Some are in running shorts and sun visors, and some are in exercise leotards with pastel-colored knitted leggings, similar to those shown on TV in the past.</t6249> <t6250>There are even a few dressed in cheerleader costumes, with small pleated skirts and large letters on the chest.</t6250> <t6251>I think they had to make do with a mix of what they could steal or save.</t6251> <t6252>They all have makeup on, and I realize how much I've lost the habit of seeing it on women, because their eyes seem very large, very dark and shiny, their mouths very red, very wet, blood-stained and glittery to me; or, on the other hand, very clownish.</t6252>
<t6253>At first glance, this scene is almost festive.</t6253> <t6254>Like a masquerade ball; they are like big children, in the clothes they rummaged out of the chests.</t6254> <t6255>Is there joy in this?</t6255> <t6256>Maybe, but is this their own choice?</t6256> <t6257>This cannot be understood by appearances.</t6257>
<t6258>A parade of butts is swaying in this room.</t6258> <t6259>I'm not very used to them anymore.</t6259>
<t6260>“It's like walking into the past,” says the Commander.</t6260> <t6261>His voice sounds pleased, even joyful.</t6261> <t6262>“Don't you think so?</t6262><t6263>”</t6263>
<t6264>I'm trying to remember if the past was exactly like this.</t6264> <t6265>I'm not quite sure, now.</t6265> <t6266>I know it contained things like this, but this mixture is somehow different.</t6266> <t6267>A film about the past is not the same as the past.</t6267>
<t6268>“Yes,” I say.</t6268> <t6269>It's not just one thing I feel.</t6269> <t6270>Of course, these women do not scare me, nor do they astonish me.</t6270> <t6271>I look at them as school dropouts.</t6271> <t6272>The official view denies them, denies even their existence, yet here they are.</t6272> <t6273>At the very least, it's something.</t6273>
<t6274>“Stop looking around,” says the Commander.</t6274> <t6275>“You will give yourself away.</t6275> <t6276>Act naturally.”</t6276> <t6277>He directs me forward again.</t6277> <t6278>Another man salutes him and starts moving towards us.</t6278> <t6279>The Commander's hand tightens on my arm.</t6279> <t6280>“Stay calm,” he whispers.</t6280> <t6281>“Don't lose yourself.</t6281><t6282>”</t6282>
<t6283>All you have to do, I tell myself, is keep your mouth shut and look stupid.</t6283> <t6284>That shouldn't be so hard.</t6284>
<t6285>The Commander does the talking on my behalf, with this man and the others who follow him.</t6285> <t6286>He doesn't say much about me, there's no need for that.</t6286> <t6287>He says that I am new, they look at me and then leave me to talk about other things.</t6287> <t6288>My disguise serves its purpose.</t6288>
<t6289>He grabs my arm again and while talking, his spine subtly straightens, his chest expands, his voice gradually takes on the vitality and playfulness of youth.</t6289> <t6290>It seems to me that he is showing off.</t6290> <t6291>He is showing off to them with me, and they understand it, they are polite enough, they keep their hands to themselves, but they scrutinize my chest, my legs, as if there is no reason not to.</t6291> <t6292>But he is also showing off to me.</t6292> <t6293>He is showing me his dominance over the world.</t6293> <t6294>He breaks the rules right under their noses, mocks them, evades them.</t6294> <t6295>Perhaps he has reached the state of intoxication said to be inspired by power, the state where you believe you are indispensable and therefore can do everything, absolutely everything, just as you wish.</t6295> <t6296>Twice, when he thinks no one is looking, he winks at me.</t6296>
<t6297>This is a childish display, all this action, pathetic; but something I understand.</t6297>
<t6298>When he gets tired of doing this, he drags me to another place, to a flowery puffy sofa that used to be in hotel lobbies; in this lobby, I do indeed remember a floral pattern, pink art nouveau flowers on a navy blue background.</t6298> <t6299>“Your feet must be tired,” he says, “in these shoes.”</t6299> <t6300>He’s right, and I’m grateful to him for that.</t6300> <t6301>He sits me down and sits next to me.</t6301> <t6302>He wraps one arm around my shoulder.</t6302> <t6303>The fabric of his jacket sleeve scratches my skin, I’m not at all used to being touched lately.</t6303>
<t6304>“Yes?” he says.</t6304> <t6305>“What do you think about our little club?</t6305><t6306>”</t6306>
<t6307>I look around again.</t6307> <t6308>The men, as I initially thought, are not of a single race.</t6308> <t6309>In the middle of the fountain, there is a group of Japanese, in light-gray suits, and in the distant corner, a white spot: Arabs, with their long garments, keffiyehs, and agals.</t6309>
<t6310>“Is this a club?” I say.</t6310>
<t6311>“Eh, that's what we call it, among ourselves.</t6311> <t6312>The club.</t6312><t6313>”</t6313>
<t6314>"I think that such a thing is definitely forbidden, I say.</t6314><t6315>"</t6315>
<t6316>“Yes, officially,” he says.</t6316> <t6317>“After all, we are all human.</t6317><t6318>”</t6318>
<t6319>I'm waiting for him to elaborate on this topic a bit more, but he doesn't, so I say, "What does this mean?"</t6319>
<t6320>“That means you can't fool Nature,” he says.</t6320> <t6321>“Nature demands variety, for men.</t6321> <t6322>This makes sense, it's part of the fertilization strategy.</t6322> <t6323>Nature's design.”</t6323> <t6324>I don't say anything, so he continues.</t6324> <t6325>“Women know this instinctively.</t6325> <t6326>Why would they buy so many different clothes, in the old days?</t6326> <t6327>To make men believe they were different women.</t6327> <t6328>A new one every day.</t6328><t6329>”</t6329>
<t6330>He talks as if he believes this, but he says many things like this anyway, maybe he believes it, maybe he doesn't, or maybe he does both at the same time.</t6330> <t6331>It's impossible to say what he believes.</t6331>
<t6332>"So, because we don't have different clothes now," I say, "you have different women."</t6332> <t6333>This irony, however, does not show that he noticed.</t6333>
<t6334>“This solves many problems,” he says, without lifting a finger.</t6334>
<t6335>I don't respond to this.</t6335> <t6336>I'm starting to get tired of him.</t6336> <t6337>I feel that I'm growing cold towards him, that I'll spend the rest of the evening in a gloomy silence.</t6337> <t6338>But I can't afford to do that, I know.</t6338> <t6339>No matter what, it's still an evening spent outside.</t6339>
<t6340>What I really want to do is talk to women, but I see that I have very little chance for that.</t6340>
<t6341>"Who are these people?" I ask him.</t6341>
<t6342>“This is only for officers,” he says.</t6342> <t6343>“From all branches; and senior officials.</t6343> <t6344>And commercial delegations, of course.</t6344> <t6345>It promotes trade.</t6345> <t6346>It's a good place to meet people.</t6346> <t6347>You can't do much trade without it.</t6347> <t6348>We try to provide things as good as they can find elsewhere.</t6348> <t6349>You might also overhear something; you can gather information.</t6349> <t6350>A man sometimes tells a woman things he wouldn't tell another man.</t6350><t6351>”</t6351>
<t6352>"No," I say.</t6352> <t6353>"I mean the women.</t6353><t6354>"</t6354>
<t6355>“Oh,” he says.</t6355> <t6356>“Yes, some are real professionals.</t6356> <t6357>The working girls,” -laughs- “left over from the previous time.</t6357> <t6358>They couldn't be assimilated; anyway, most of them prefer this place.</t6358><t6359>”</t6359>
<t6360>“What about the others?</t6360><t6361>”</t6361>
<t6362>“The others?” he says.</t6362> <t6363>“Well, we have a good collection.</t6363> <t6364>The one over there, in the green outfit, is a sociologist.</t6364> <t6365>Or was, anyway.</t6365> <t6366>That one was a lawyer, that one was in business, in an administrative position; something like a fast-food chain or maybe a hotel chain.</t6366> <t6367>If all you want is to talk, I heard he’s great for conversation.</t6367> <t6368>They prefer this place too.</t6368><t6369>”</t6369>
<t6370>"What do they prefer?" I say.</t6370>
<t6371>“The options,” he says.</t6371> <t6372>“Even you might prefer this place if you compare it with what you have.”</t6372> <t6373>He says this smugly, fishing for compliments, wanting to be praised, and I realize that the serious part of the conversation is over.</t6373>
<t6374>“I don't know,” I say, as if I were thinking about it.</t6374> <t6375>“This job might be too much.</t6375><t6376>”</t6376>
<t6377>“You will need to be careful about your weight, definitely,” he says.</t6377> <t6378>“They are very meticulous about it.</t6378> <t6379>If you gain five kilos, you will end up in the Cell.”</t6379> <t6380>Is he joking?</t6380> <t6381>Probably, but I don't want to know.</t6381>
<t6382>“Yes,” he says, “how about a little drink to get you into the mood of this place?</t6382><t6383>”</t6383>
<t6384>“I shouldn't drink,” I say, “you know.</t6384><t6385>”</t6385>
<t6386>“Nothing will happen from doing it once,” he says.</t6386> <t6387>“Anyway, not smoking is not good for you.</t6387> <t6388>Nicotine and alcohol are not banned here!</t6388> <t6389>You see, there are some advantages here.</t6389><t6390>”</t6390>
<t6391>"Okay," I say.</t6391> <t6392>Secretly, I like this idea; I haven't had a drink in years.</t6392>
<t6393>“So what, then?” he says.</t6393> <t6394>“Everything is here.</t6394> <t6395>Imported.</t6395><t6396>”</t6396>
<t6397>"A gin and tonic," I say.</t6397> <t6398>"But just a little, please.</t6398> <t6399>I don't want to embarrass you.</t6399><t6400>"</t6400>
<t6401>“You wouldn't do it,” he says, grinning.</t6401> <t6402>He stands up, then, astonishingly, takes my hand and kisses the palm.</t6402> <t6403>Then he walks away, towards the bar.</t6403> <t6404>He could have called a waitress, there are a few, with pom-poms on their chests and the same type of black mini skirts, but they look busy and it's hard to stop them.</t6404>
<t6405>Then I see her.</t6405> <t6406>Moira.</t6406> <t6407>She is standing with two women, near the fountain.</t6407> <t6408>I have to look carefully, again, to be sure it's her; I do it in a flash, moving my eyes quickly, so no one notices.</t6408>
<t6409>Dressed ridiculously, she wears a garment made of black satin that was once shiny but now looks too bad to wear.</t6409> <t6410>Strapless, tied from the inside, lifting her breasts, but it doesn't fit Moira well, it's too big, so much so that one breast is popping out, the other deflated.</t6410> <t6411>She absentmindedly pulls her blouse up.</t6411> <t6412>There is a cotton pad behind her, I can see it when she half-turns; it looks like gauze, popped like a corn kernel.</t6412> <t6413>I realize it is meant to be a tail.</t6413> <t6414>Two ears are attached to her head, either of a rabbit or a deer, it's hard to tell which; one of the ears has lost its starch or the wire has loosened and it keeps falling down.</t6414> <t6415>She has a black bow tie around her neck, wearing black fishnet stockings and high-heeled shoes.</t6415> <t6416>She always hated high heels.</t6416>
<t6417>This antique and strange costume reminds me of something from the past, but I don't know what.</t6417> <t6418>A stage play or a musical comedy?</t6418> <t6419>Girls dressed for Easter, in bunny costumes.</t6419> <t6420>What does this mean here, why do bunnies appear sexually attractive to men?</t6420> <t6421>How can this shabby costume be appealing?</t6421>
<t6422>Moira is smoking a cigarette.</t6422> <t6423>She takes a puff, then hands it to the woman dressed in a red scaly outfit with a long spotted tail and silver horns - a devil costume.</t6423> <t6424>Now she has her arms crossed in front of her, under her supported breasts.</t6424> <t6425>She shifts her weight to one foot, then the other; her feet must be hurting, her spine slightly bending.</t6425> <t6426>She is not looking around the room with indifference or thoughtlessness.</t6426> <t6427>This must be a familiar scene for her.</t6427>
<t6428>I want him to look at me, to see me, but his gaze slips away from me, as if I were just another palm tree, another chair.</t6428> <t6429>Surely he will turn this way, I want it so much, he must look at me before one of the men goes to him and they disappear together.</t6429> <t6430>The other woman beside me, the blonde in the jacket with the pink plush collar, has already gotten into the glass elevator and vanished upwards.</t6430> <t6431>Moira is turning her head from side to side, trying to spot potential customers.</t6431> <t6432>It must be hard to stand there unclaimed, as if overlooked at a high school prom.</t6432> <t6433>This time his eyes catch on me.</t6433> <t6434>He sees me.</t6434> <t6435>Smart enough not to react.</t6435>
<t6436>Our facial expressions are blank and indifferent, we are looking at each other.</t6436> <t6437>Then he makes a small movement with his head, slightly tilting it to the right.</t6437> <t6438>He takes the cigarette back from the woman in red, brings it to his mouth, holds his hand in the air for a moment, showing five fingers.</t6438> <t6439>Then he turns his back to me.</t6439>
<t6440>Our old sign.</t6440> <t6441>I have five minutes to go to the women's restroom, which should be somewhere to the right.</t6441> <t6442>I'm not looking around: there's no sign of a restroom.</t6442> <t6443>I can't risk getting up and going somewhere without the commander.</t6443> <t6444>I don't know much, I don't know the rules here, they might stop and ask for identification.</t6444>
<t6445>One minute, two.</t6445> <t6446>Moira starts to leave, swaying, without looking around.</t6446> <t6447>She can only hope that I understand her and will follow her.</t6447>
<t6448>The commander is coming back, with two drinks.</t6448> <t6449>He smiles at me, places the drinks on the long black coffee table in front of the couch, and sits down.</t6449> <t6450>"Are you having fun?" he says.</t6450> <t6451>He wants me to have fun.</t6451> <t6452>Above all, this is a party.</t6452>
<t6453>I smile at her.</t6453> <t6454>“Is there a restroom here?” I ask.</t6454>
<t6455>“Of course,” he says.</t6455> <t6456>He sips his drink.</t6456> <t6457>He doesn't indicate any direction.</t6457>
<t6458>"I need to go there."</t6458> <t6459>Now I count in my mind, not the seconds, but the minutes.</t6459>
<t6460>“Over there,” he nods his head.</t6460> <t6461>“What if someone stops me?</t6461><t6462>”</t6462>
<t6463>“Just showing your receipt is enough,” he says.</t6463> <t6464>“There won't be any trouble.</t6464> <t6465>They'll understand that it is owned.</t6465><t6466>”</t6466>
<t6467>I get up, wobbling as I cross the room.</t6467> <t6468>I stumble a bit, almost falling near the faucet.</t6468> <t6469>Because of the high heels.</t6469> <t6470>Without the Commander's supporting arm, I am unsteady.</t6470> <t6471>A few of the men look at me, I think more in surprise than lust.</t6471> <t6472>I feel like an idiot.</t6472> <t6473>I hold my left arm visibly in front of me, bent at the elbow, with the plug facing outward.</t6473> <t6474>No one says anything.</t6474>
<t6475>38</t6475>
<t6476>I find the entrance to the women's restroom.</t6476> <t6477>It still has</t6477> <t6478>the word "Ladies" written on it, in fancy gilded letters.</t6478> <t6479>The door is at the end of a corridor, and a woman who controls the comings and goings sits at a desk next to the door.</t6479> <t6480>An elderly woman, wearing a purple caftan and gold eyeshadow, but I can still tell she is an Aunt.</t6480> <t6481>The prod is on the desk, with its strap attached to her wrist.</t6481> <t6482>Don't do anything foolish here.</t6482>
<t6483>“Fifteen minutes,” he says to me.</t6483> <t6484>He hands me a square purple paper taken from a stack on the table.</t6484> <t6485>It looks like a fitting room in the stores of the previous era.</t6485> <t6486>I hear him say to the woman behind me, “You were just here.”</t6486>
<t6487>“I must go back in,” says the woman.</t6487>
<t6488>“Rest break is on the hour,” says Aunt.</t6488> <t6489>“You know the rules.</t6489><t6490>”</t6490>
<t6491>The woman starts to object in a tearful, hopeless voice.</t6491> <t6492>I push the door open.</t6492>
<t6493>I remember this place.</t6493> <t6494>There is a resting area, softly lit with pink tones, a few chairs and a sofa, painted lemon green over bamboo, and a wall clock with a gilded filigree frame on top.</t6494> <t6495>They haven't removed the mirror; there's a long one across from the sofa.</t6495> <t6496>Here, you need to know how you look.</t6496> <t6497>In the arched corridor beyond, there are toilet stalls, also pink; sinks and a few more mirrors.</t6497>
<t6498>A few women, who have taken off their shoes, are sitting on the armchairs and the sofa, smoking cigarettes.</t6498> <t6499>When I enter, they look at me.</t6499> <t6500>There is a scent of perfume, stale smoke, and the odor of bodies that have been at work in the air.</t6500>
<t6501>"Are you new?" asks one of them.</t6501>
<t6502>"Yes," I say, not looking around as I search for Moira, who is nowhere to be seen.</t6502>
<t6503>The women are not smiling.</t6503> <t6504>As if it were a serious task, they continue smoking.</t6504> <t6505>In the room over there, a woman dressed in an orange faux fur cat costume is touching up her makeup.</t6505> <t6506>This place is like a backstage: paints for theater makeup, smoke, materials for illusions.</t6506>
<t6507>I stand hesitantly, not knowing what to do.</t6507> <t6508>I don't want to ask about Moira, I don't know if it's safe.</t6508> <t6509>Then a toilet flushes and Moira comes out of a pink stall.</t6509> <t6510>She stumbles towards me; I'm waiting for a sign.</t6510>
<t6511>“Okay,” she says, to me and the other women.</t6511> <t6512>“I know her.”</t6512> <t6513>The others are now smiling and Moira hugs me.</t6513> <t6514>My arms wrap around her neck and the wires lifting her breasts press into my chest.</t6514> <t6515>We kiss each other, one cheek, then the other.</t6515> <t6516>Then we pull back a little.</t6516>
<t6517>“Oh my God,” he says.</t6517> <t6518>He grins at me.</t6518> <t6519>“You look like the Whore of Babylon.</t6519><t6520>”</t6520>
<t6521>“Don't I need to look like this?” I say.</t6521> <t6522>“You also look like something the cat dragged in.</t6522><t6523>”</t6523>
<t6524>“Yes,” he says, pulling up his front.</t6524> <t6525>“It's not my style, and this thing is about to fall apart.</t6525> <t6526>I wish they could find someone from underground who still knows how to make these.</t6526> <t6527>That way, I could get something a bit more decent.</t6527><t6528>”</t6528>
<t6529>"Are you choosing these?" I ask.</t6529> <t6530>I wonder if he is choosing it because he finds it less flashy than the other items.</t6530> <t6531>At least it's only in black and white.</t6531>
<t6532>“Damn it, no,” he says.</t6532> <t6533>“Government job.</t6533> <t6534>I guess they thought it was just right for me.</t6534><t6535>”</t6535>
<t6536>I still can't believe that the person in front of me is him.</t6536> <t6537>I touch his arm again.</t6537> <t6538>Then I start to cry.</t6538>
<t6539>“Don't cry,” he says.</t6539> <t6540>“Your makeup will run.</t6540> <t6541>Anyway, there's no time.</t6541> <t6542>Move aside.”</t6542> <t6543>He says this to the two women on the couch, with his usual authoritative, rude, and careless manner, and as always, he succeeds.</t6543>
<t6544>“The prayer is over anyway,” says the woman in the baby blue lace Merry Widow outfit with white stockings.</t6544> <t6545>She stands up and shakes my hand.</t6545> <t6546>“Welcome,” she says.</t6546>
<t6547>The other woman gently moves away, Moira and I sit down.</t6547> <t6548>The first thing we do is take off our shoes.</t6548>
<t6549>“For God's sake, what the hell are you doing here?” says Moira then.</t6549> <t6550>“It's great to see you though.</t6550> <t6551>But not so much for you.</t6551> <t6552>What kind of mistake did you make?</t6552> <t6553>Did you laugh at the guy's thing?</t6553><t6554>”</t6554>
<t6555>I look at Tavana.</t6555> <t6556>“Are we resting?” I say.</t6556> <t6557>With my fingertips, I carefully wipe around my eyes.</t6557> <t6558>Black paint comes off.</t6558>
<t6559>"Probably," says Moira.</t6559> <t6560>"Do you want a cigarette?" "I would love one," I say.</t6560>
<t6561>"Well," he says to the woman next to him.</t6561> <t6562>"Lend me a cigarette, will you?"</t6562><t6563>"</t6563>
<t6564>The woman gives one, without grumbling.</t6564> <t6565>Moira is still a skillful scrounger.</t6565> <t6566>I smile at this.</t6566>
<t6567>“On the other hand, it might not,” says Moira.</t6567> <t6568>“I don't think they will care about what we talked about.</t6568> <t6569>They've already heard most of it anyway, no one can leave here except in a black van.</t6569> <t6570>But you must know that, since you are here.</t6570><t6571>”</t6571>
<t6572>I pull his head towards me as if to whisper in his ear.</t6572> <t6573>"I am temporary," I tell him.</t6573> <t6574>"Just for tonight.</t6574> <t6575>I shouldn't be here at all.</t6575> <t6576>He snuck me in here secretly.</t6576><t6577>"</t6577>
<t6578>“Kim?” he whispers.</t6578> <t6579>“That shitty guy you're with?</t6579> <t6580>I slept with him.</t6580> <t6581>He's a total jerk.</t6581><t6582>”</t6582>
<t6583>"He is my Commander." I say.</t6583>
<t6584>He nods his head.</t6584> <t6585>"Someone is doing this, they enjoy it.</t6585> <t6586>Like having sex in a shrine or a similar place: it is thought that your team is the epitome of honor.</t6586> <t6587>They like to see you painted.</t6587> <t6588>Another miserable display of power.</t6588><t6589>"</t6589>
<t6590>This comment hadn't occurred to me.</t6590> <t6591>I'm applying this to the Commander, but it seems too simple for him, too crude.</t6591> <t6592>I'm sure his impulses are more subtle than this.</t6592> <t6593>But it could also just be arrogance that's forcing me to think this way.</t6593>
<t6594>"We don't have much time left," I say.</t6594> <t6595>"Tell me everything.</t6595><t6596>"</t6596>
<t6597>Moira shrugs her shoulders.</t6597> <t6598>"What does it matter?" she says.</t6598> <t6599>But she knows it does matter, which is why she explains.</t6599>
<t6600>These are what they told, whispered, almost.</t6600> <t6601>I don't remember exactly, because there was no way to record these by writing.</t6601> <t6602>I completed as much as I could; we didn't have much time, so they only gave the main points.</t6602> <t6603>Also, they told me this in two sessions, we managed to find a second break together.</t6603> <t6604>I tried to convey it from their mouth as best as I could.</t6604> <t6605>This is one way to keep it alive.</t6605>
<t6606>“I left that old hag Aunt Elizabeth folded up behind the radiator like a Christmas turkey.</t6606> <t6607>I wanted to kill her, I really felt that way, but now I'm glad I didn't, otherwise things would have been pretty bad for me.</t6607> <t6608>I couldn't believe how easy it was to get out of the Center.</t6608> <t6609>I just passed by in that brown outfit.</t6609> <t6610>I kept walking as if I knew where I was going, until I was out of sight.</t6610> <t6611>I didn't have such a great plan; it wasn't set up the way they thought, although I made up many stories while they were trying to learn it from me.</t6611> <t6612>After using the electrodes and other things, you do that.</t6612> <t6613>You don't care what you say.</t6613>
<t6614>I continued to walk with my shoulders straight and my head held high, trying to think about what to do next.</t6614> <t6615>When they raided the printing house, they had caught most of the women I knew, and I thought they had probably caught the rest by now.</t6615> <t6616>I was sure they had a list.</t6616> <t6617>It was foolish of us to believe we could continue as before, even underground, even though we had moved everything from the office to people's basements and back rooms.</t6617> <t6618>I knew it would be wiser not to go to one of these houses.</t6618>
<t6619>I had an idea of where I was in relation to the city center, though I was walking down a street I couldn't recall seeing before.</t6619> <t6620>But I looked at the sun and calculated where north was.</t6620> <t6621>Finally, being a Girl Scout had come in handy.</t6621> <t6622>I thought I could continue in this direction to see if I could find the Yard or the Square or anything around it.</t6622> <t6623>That way, I would be sure of where I was.</t6623> <t6624>Also, going towards the center of events seemed better for me than going outward.</t6624> <t6625>It would seem more logical.</t6625>
<t6626>When we were at the Center, they had increased the number of checkpoints; they were everywhere.</t6626> <t6627>The first one scared the living daylights out of me.</t6627> <t6628>It suddenly appeared in front of me as I turned the corner.</t6628> <t6629>I knew it wouldn't look right if I turned around and went back after it had fully appeared, so I bluffed and walked past it, just like at the door, putting on that frown and standing tall, pursing my lips and piercing them with my gaze, as if they were festering wounds.</t6629> <t6630>You know how the Aunts look when they say the word 'man.'</t6630> <t6631>It worked like a charm, at the other checkpoints too.</t6631>
<t6632>But my brain was working like crazy.</t6632> <t6633>I had time until they found the old bat and sounded the alarm.</t6633> <t6634>They would soon be looking for me: a fake aunt, on foot.</t6634> <t6635>I tried to remember someone, I went over the people I knew again and again in my mind.</t6635> <t6636>Finally, I tried to recall our letter list as best as I could.</t6636> <t6637>Of course, we had destroyed them long ago; or we hadn't destroyed them but had divided them among ourselves; after each of us memorized a part, we had destroyed them.</t6637> <t6638>At that time, we were still conducting business by letter, but we no longer put our logo on the envelopes.</t6638> <t6639>It had started to become too risky.</t6639>
<t6640>So I tried to recall the part of the list that belongs to me.</t6640> <t6641>I won't tell you the name I chose, because I don't want them to get into trouble, if they haven't already.</t6641> <t6642>Maybe I have said things that would give them away, it's hard to remember what you said when they do such things to you.</t6642> <t6643>You say everything.</t6643>
<t6644>I chose them because they were a married couple, and they were safer than a single person, especially a homo.</t6644> <t6645>I also remembered the title next to their names.</t6645> <t6646>Q, meaning Quaker.</t6646> <t6647>If there were any, we would mark religious titles for the marches.</t6647> <t6648>That way, it could be understood who would come to which demonstration.</t6648> <t6649>For example, it was not a good idea to refer to the H's regarding abortion; not that we had been doing such demonstrations recently anyway.</t6649> <t6650>I also remembered their addresses.</t6650> <t6651>We would question each other a lot about these addresses, it was important to remember them exactly, including the postal code, etc.</t6651>
<t6652>I had reached Mass Avenue by then and I knew where I was.</t6652> <t6653>And where they were too.</t6653> <t6654>But now I was worried about something else: Wouldn't these people lock the door and pretend they weren't home when they saw an Aunt coming down the road?</t6654> <t6655>But I had to try, it was my only chance.</t6655> <t6656>They probably wouldn't shoot me.</t6656> <t6657>By this time, it was around five o'clock.</t6657> <t6658>I was tired from walking, especially because of the style of the Aunts who walked like damned soldiers with a prod hanging from their rear, and I hadn't eaten anything since breakfast.</t6658>
<t6659>Undoubtedly, what I didn't know was that in those early days, the Aunts, even the Center, were not well known.</t6659> <t6660>At first, everything was a secret; what they did behind the barbed wire could be opposed, even then.</t6660> <t6661>Thus, although people saw the strange Aunts around, they were not really aware of what they were actually doing.</t6661> <t6662>They must have thought they were some sort of army nurses.</t6662> <t6663>They had long since stopped asking questions unless they had to.</t6663>
<t6664>Thus, these people immediately let me inside.</t6664> <t6665>The person who came to the door was a woman.</t6665> <t6666>I told her that I was conducting a survey.</t6666> <t6667>I said this so that if someone was watching, they wouldn't look surprised.</t6667> <t6668>But as soon as I stepped inside, I took off my hood and told them who I was.</t6668> <t6669>They could have called the police or someone else, I know, I was taking a risk, but as I said, I had no other choice.</t6669> <t6670>Anyway, they didn't call.</t6670> <t6671>They gave me some clothes, one of the woman's dresses, Aunt's clothes, and they burned her identity in their stove; they knew this had to be done immediately.</t6671> <t6672>They didn't like having me there, that much was clear, it made them quite nervous.</t6672> <t6673>They had two small children, both under the age of seven.</t6673> <t6674>I could understand their reasons.</t6674>
<t6675>I went to the bathroom, what a great relief.</t6675> <t6676>The tub was filled with plastic fish and so on.</t6676> <t6677>While the parents stayed downstairs and decided what to do with me, I sat in the children's room upstairs, playing with them and their plastic blocks.</t6677> <t6678>At that time, I wasn't scared; in fact, I felt very good.</t6678> <t6679>You could say I was fatalistic.</t6679> <t6680>Then the woman made me a sandwich and a cup of coffee, and the man told me he would take me to another house.</t6680> <t6681>They hadn't dared to make a phone call.</t6681>
<t6682>The other house belonged to the Quakers, and it was just the right place because it was a station on the Underground Female Road.</t6682> <t6683>After the first man left, they told me they would try to get me out of the country.</t6683> <t6684>I'm not going to tell you how, because some stations might still be operational. Each station was only in contact with another, always with the next one.</t6684> <t6685>This system had its advantages—it worked when caught—but also disadvantages, because when one station was dismantled, the entire chain broke until contact was made with one of the couriers who could establish another route.</t6685> <t6686>They were better organized than you might think, nonetheless.</t6686> <t6687>They had infiltrated a few key places; one was the post office.</t6687> <t6688>There, they had a driver with that handy little truck.</t6688> <t6689>I went to the city from the bridge in a mailbag.</t6689> <t6690>I can tell you this because they caught him shortly after this job.</t6690> <t6691>The poor man faced the Wall.</t6691> <t6692>You hear such things; so much is heard here that you would be amazed.</t6692> <t6693>The Commanders themselves tell these stories, I guess they think why not, there's no one we can convey it to except each other, and it doesn't matter.</t6693>
<t6694>I'm trying to make it look easy, but it wasn't.</t6694> <t6695>I was extremely anxious the whole time.</t6695> <t6696>The hardest part was knowing that these people were risking their lives for you, even though they didn't have to.</t6696> <t6697>But they said they were doing it for religious reasons and that I shouldn't take it personally.</t6697> <t6698>That helped a bit.</t6698> <t6699>Every evening, they prayed quietly.</t6699> <t6700>At first, I had a hard time getting used to it because it reminded me too much of the filth at the Center.</t6700> <t6701>To be honest, it made me sick.</t6701> <t6702>I had to make an effort, tell myself that this was something entirely different.</t6702> <t6703>At first, I hated it.</t6703> <t6704>But I understand that this was what kept them going.</t6704> <t6705>If they got caught, they had a rough idea of what would happen to them.</t6705> <t6706>Not in detail, but they knew.</t6706> <t6707>Around that time, they had started showing some of this on television, the trials and other things.</t6707>
<t6708>It was before the serious commencement of sectarian pursuits.</t6708> <t6709>As long as you said you were a kind of Christian and married, meaning in your first marriage, they didn't bother you much yet.</t6709> <t6710>They were primarily dealing with others.</t6710> <t6711>They had more or less brought them under control before starting to deal with everyone else.</t6711>
<t6712>I was underground, it must have been eight or nine months.</t6712> <t6713>I was being taken from one safe house to another, there were many of these houses back then.</t6713> <t6714>Not all of them were Quakers, some weren't even religious.</t6714> <t6715>They were just people who didn't like the way things were going.</t6715>
<t6716>I almost succeeded.</t6716> <t6717>They took me as far as Salem, and then with a truck full of chickens to Maine.</t6717> <t6718>I almost threw up from the smell.</t6718> <t6719>Have you ever thought about what it would be like to be covered in shit by a truckload of carsick chickens?</t6719> <t6720>They planned to get me across the border there; not by car or truck, that had already become too difficult, but by boat, up from the beach.</t6720> <t6721>I didn't know this until that night; they wouldn't tell me the next step until just before.</t6721> <t6722>They were so careful.</t6722>
<t6723>So, I have no idea what's going on.</t6723> <t6724>Maybe someone got scared or someone from outside got suspicious.</t6724> <t6725>Or maybe it was the boat that drew attention, maybe they thought the man stayed out too long with his boat at night.</t6725> <t6726>At that time, those places and everywhere near the border must have been swarming with Eyes.</t6726> <t6727>Whatever it was, they caught us just as we were going out the back door to head to the dock.</t6727> <t6728>Me, the man, and his wife.</t6728> <t6729>They were an elderly couple, around fifty years old.</t6729> <t6730>The man was in the lobster business, before all that stuff happened to the coastal fishing there.</t6730> <t6731>I don't know what happened to them after that, because they put me in a separate van.</t6731>
<t6732>I thought my end had come, for me.</t6732> <t6733>Or that I would return to the Center, to Aunt Lydia and her compassionate care with steel wires.</t6733> <t6734>Your wife liked this, you know.</t6734> <t6735>She seemed to be doing all that love-the-sinner, hate-the-sin nonsense, but she also liked it.</t6735> <t6736>I thought about killing myself, maybe I would have, if I found a way.</t6736> <t6737>But they had given me two Eyes in the back of the van, they were burying me like a hawk; they didn't say a single word, just sat there and watched me with their cross-eyed looks.</t6737> <t6738>That's why it didn't happen.</t6738>
<t6739>Still, instead of going to the center, we went somewhere else.</t6739> <t6740>I will not go into the details of what happened next.</t6740> <t6741>I prefer not to speak.</t6741> <t6742>All I can say is that they left no trace.</t6742>
<t6743>When this job was done, they showed me a movie.</t6743> <t6744>Do you know what it was about?</t6744> <t6745>About life in the Colonies.</t6745> <t6746>In the Colonies, they spend their time cleaning.</t6746> <t6747>These days, they are very keen on cleaning.</t6747> <t6748>Sometimes, the only thing being cleaned is the bodies, left over from a clash.</t6748> <t6749>The ones in the outskirts of the city are the worst, left out for a longer time, they are more decayed.</t6749> <t6750>This team doesn't like bodies scattered around, they fear an epidemic or something similar.</t6750> <t6751>Therefore, women in the Colonies do the corpse burning.</t6751> <t6752>The other Colonies are even worse, due to toxic waste and radiation leaks, they estimate you have at most three years before your nose falls off and your skin peels like deep rubber gloves.</t6752> <t6753>They don't bother to feed, clothe, or provide protective gear or anything else, it's cheaper not to.</t6753> <t6754>Besides, these are mostly the people they want to get rid of anyway.</t6754> <t6755>They say there are other Colonies too, not as bad, where people engage in agriculture: cotton, tomatoes, and other vegetables.</t6755> <t6756>But the movie they showed wasn't about these.</t6756>
<t6757>The women were old, I bet you're wondering why you don't see many of them around anymore; also, there were the Handmaids who had used up their three chances and the incorrigibles like me.</t6757> <t6758>We were all cast aside.</t6758> <t6759>Of course, they were all sterile.</t6759> <t6760>If they weren't at first, it was inevitable after staying there for a while.</t6760> <t6761>If they weren't sure, they would perform a small operation to ensure there were no mistakes.</t6761> <t6762>I can say that a quarter of those in the Colonies were men.</t6762> <t6763>Not all Sexual Traitors end up hanging on the Wall.</t6763>
<t6764>They all wear long dresses, just like those at the Center, except theirs are gray.</t6764> <t6765>From what I gathered from the group shots, men are also in dresses, just like the women.</t6765> <t6766>I think this is done to break the men's resistance, that is, to force them to wear dresses.</t6766> <t6767>Damn, it would certainly break my resistance enough.</t6767> <t6768>How do you endure this?</t6768> <t6769>Considering all this, I like these clothes even more.</t6769>
<t6770>After that, they told me I was too dangerous to be granted the privilege of returning to the Red Center.</t6770> <t6771>They said I would have a destructive effect.</t6771> <t6772>They also told me I had a choice, here or the Colonies.</t6772> <t6773>Yes, damn it, no one but a nun would choose the Colonies.</t6773> <t6774>I mean, I'm not a martyr of faith.</t6774> <t6775>I had my tubes tied years ago, so I didn't need this surgery.</t6775> <t6776>None of the workers here have ovaries anyway, you can understand what kind of problems that might cause.</t6776>
<t6777>Here I am.</t6777> <t6778>They even give you face cream.</t6778> <t6779>You must find a way to get in here.</t6779> <t6780>Before this short period ends and they scrap you, you would live well for three or four years.</t6780> <t6781>The food isn't bad, if you want, there are also drinks and drugs, plus we only work at night.</t6781><t6782>”</t6782>
<t6783>“Moira,” I say.</t6783> <t6784>“You can't be serious.”</t6784> <t6785>She frightens me now, because what I hear in her voice is indifference, a lack of will.</t6785> <t6786>Have they really done it, taken away something so fundamental in her -what?- or not?</t6786> <t6787>How can I expect her to continue, to live on with the thought of her courage in me, when I myself do not do this?</t6787>
<t6788>I don't want him to be like me.</t6788> <t6789>To surrender, to compromise, to cowardly worry about his own life.</t6789> <t6790>In the end, it all comes down to this.</t6790> <t6791>I want courage, pride, heroism, a one-man war from him.</t6791> <t6792>Something that I lack.</t6792>
<t6793>“Don't worry about me,” she says.</t6793> <t6794>She must have understood some of my thoughts.</t6794> <t6795>“I am still here, you can see that it's me.</t6795> <t6796>Anyway, look at it this way: It's not that bad, there are plenty of women around.</t6796> <t6797>You could call it a lesbian paradise.</t6797><t6798>”</t6798>
<t6799>He started to mock, showing signs of liveliness, I feel better.</t6799> <t6800>"Do they allow this?" I say.</t6800>
<t6801>“Allow it? Damn it, they even encourage it.</t6801> <t6802>Do you know what they call this place among themselves?</t6802> <t6803>Jezebel's Place.</t6803> <t6804>The Aunts think that we are all cursed in some way, they have given up on us, so it doesn't matter what kind of sin we commit, the Commanders don't even care what we do in our spare time.</t6804> <t6805>Anyway, they get excited by women loving women</t6805><t6806>a</t6806><t6807>”</t6807>
<t6808>“What about the others?” I say.</t6808>
<t6809>“Let's put it this way,” he says, “they don't really like men.”</t6809> <t6810>He shrugs again.</t6810> <t6811>This could be resignation.</t6811>
<t6812>I would like to tell this: I would like to tell a story about how Moira escaped, this time for good.</t6812> <t6813>Or if I can't do that, I would like to tell that she blew up Jezebel's Place along with fifty Commanders inside.</t6813> <t6814>I would like her end to come with something daring and flamboyant, destructive, something that suits her.</t6814> <t6815>But as far as I know, that didn't happen.</t6815> <t6816>I don't know how her end came, or even if it did, because I never saw her again.</t6816>
<t6817>39</t6817>
<t6818>The Commander has a room key.</t6818> <t6819>While I was waiting on the floral couch, he went and got it from the reception.</t6819> <t6820>He's showing it to me, cunningly.</t6820> <t6821>So I should understand.</t6821>
<t6822>We ascend in a semi-egg-shaped glass elevator, passing by balconies enveloped in vines.</t6822> <t6823>I must also realize that I am being shown around.</t6823>
<t6824>He opens the door of the room.</t6824> <t6825>Everything is the same, just like it used to be.</t6825> <t6826>The curtains are the same, the ones with large flowers matching the bedspread, poppies in orange on a royal blue background, and the thin white ones used as sunshades; the writing desk and nightstands are angular, impersonal; the lamps; the pictures on the wall: fruits in a bowl, stylized apples, flowers in a vase, buttercups matching the curtains, and Devil's paintbrushes.</t6826> <t6827>Everything is the same.</t6827>
<t6828>I ask the Commander for a minute's leave and enter the bathroom.</t6828> <t6829>My ears are ringing because of the cigarette, the gin has numbed me, I'm tired.</t6829> <t6830>I wet a small towel and press it to my forehead.</t6830> <t6831>After a while, I search to see if there are any individually wrapped small soaps.</t6831> <t6832>Yes, there are.</t6832> <t6833>They are the kind with a gypsy on them, made in Spain.</t6833>
<t6834>I inhale the scent of soap, the smell of disinfectant; listening to the distant sounds of running water, the flushing toilets, I stand in the white bathroom.</t6834> <t6835>In a strange way, I feel comfortable here, like at home.</t6835> <t6836>There is something reassuring about toilets.</t6836> <t6837>At the very least, bodily functions remain democratic.</t6837> <t6838>Everyone shits, as Moira would say.</t6838>
<t6839>I am sitting by the edge of the bathtub, looking at the clean towels.</t6839> <t6840>They used to excite me once.</t6840> <t6841>They used to signify post-love.</t6841>
<t6842>I saw your mother, said Moira.</t6842>
<t6843>Where? I said.</t6843> <t6844>I felt shaken, like a ship that had lost its course.</t6844> <t6845>I realized that I had thought he was dead.</t6845>
<t6846>It wasn't about him, it was in that film about the Colonies that he showed us.</t6846> <t6847>There was a close-up shot, it was definitely him.</t6847> <t6848>He was wearing one of those gray things, but I'm sure it was him.</t6848>
<t6849>Thank God, I said.</t6849>
<t6850>Why, thank God? said Moira.</t6850>
<t6851>I thought you were dead.</t6851>
<t6852>He might be dead, said Moira.</t6852> <t6853>You should wish for his death, for his own good.</t6853>
<t6854>I can't remember the last time I saw her.</t6854> <t6855>It blends with all the others; it was an insignificant event.</t6855> <t6856>She must have just dropped by; she would do that as if I were the mother and she the child, breezing in and out of my home.</t6856> <t6857>She still had that carefreeness.</t6857> <t6858>Sometimes, when she was between homes, that is, moving from one to another, she would use my machine for her laundry.</t6858> <t6859>Maybe she had come to borrow something from me: a pot, a hairdryer.</t6859> <t6860>This was also one of her habits.</t6860>
<t6861>I didn't know this would be the last time, otherwise I would have remembered it better.</t6861> <t6862>I can't even remember what we talked about.</t6862>
<t6863>A week later, two weeks, three weeks later, when things suddenly got this bad, I tried to reach him by phone.</t6863> <t6864>But there was no answer, and there was still no answer when I tried again.</t6864>
<t6865>He hadn't mentioned to me that he was going somewhere, but maybe he wouldn't have; he didn't always tell me.</t6865> <t6866>He had his own car and he wasn't too old to drive it.</t6866>
<t6867>Finally, I caught the apartment manager on the phone.</t6867> <t6868>He said he hadn't seen him around.</t6868>
<t6869>I was worried.</t6869> <t6870>I thought maybe he had a heart attack or a stroke, which wasn't impossible, although as far as I knew, he had no illness.</t6870> <t6871>He was always so healthy.</t6871> <t6872>He still exercised at Nautilus and went for a swim twice a week.</t6872> <t6873>I used to always tell my friends that he was healthier than me, and maybe it was true.</t6873>
<t6874>We went down to the city with Luke, and Luke forced the manager to open the apartment.</t6874> <t6875>He might be dead, lying on the floor, Luke said.</t6875> <t6876>The longer you leave him there, the worse it will be.</t6876> <t6877>Have you ever thought about the smell?</t6877> <t6878>The manager said something about needing permission, but Luke was always good at being persuasive.</t6878> <t6879>He made it clear that we wouldn't wait or leave.</t6879> <t6880>I started to cry.</t6880> <t6881>Maybe that was what finally convinced him.</t6881>
<t6882>When Adam opened the door, what we saw was complete chaos.</t6882> <t6883>The furniture was overturned, mattresses were torn, the desk drawers were turned inside out, and their contents were scattered and piled up in one corner.</t6883> <t6884>But my mother was not there.</t6884>
<t6885>I will call the police, I said.</t6885> <t6886>I had stopped crying; I was frozen from head to toe, my teeth were chattering.</t6886> <t6887>Don't, said Luke.</t6887>
<t6888>Why is that? I said.</t6888> <t6889>I was glaring at him, I was already angry.</t6889> <t6890>He was standing among the ruins of the living room, just looking at me.</t6890> <t6891>He put his hands in his pockets; one of those pointless actions people resort to when they don't know what else to do.</t6891>
<t6892>Don't do it, that's what he said.</t6892>
<t6893>Another strange woman, Moira used to say, back in college.</t6893> <t6894>Later: she has charm.</t6894> <t6895>Then: she is friendly.</t6895>
<t6896>It's not close to Cana, I'd say.</t6896> <t6897>She's my mother.</t6897>
<t6898>Eeeh, said Moira, you should see mine.</t6898>
<t6899>I'm thinking of my mother, cleaning deadly poisons like they used to make old women clean filth in Russia.</t6899> <t6900>But this filth will kill her.</t6900> <t6901>Actually, I don't really believe that.</t6901> <t6902>I'm sure her confidence, optimism, and energy, her charm will help her overcome this.</t6902> <t6903>She will find a way.</t6903>
<t6904>But I know that this is not true.</t6904> <t6905>As children always do, this is just placing the responsibility on mothers.</t6905>
<t6906>I had already mourned for him.</t6906> <t6907>But I will do it again, and then again.</t6907>
<t6908>I am returning myself, here, to this hotel.</t6908> <t6909>This is where I am supposed to be.</t6909> <t6910>Now, in this large mirror under the white light, I am looking at myself.</t6910>
<t6911>I look carefully, slow and measured.</t6911> <t6912>I am a wreck.</t6912> <t6913>Despite Moira's corrections, the mascara has run again, the purple lipstick is smudged, and the hair hangs aimlessly.</t6913> <t6914>The pink tassels with shedding feathers are vulgar like carnival dolls, and a few of the gilded sequins have fallen off.</t6914> <t6915>Maybe they had fallen off from the very beginning, and I hadn't noticed.</t6915> <t6916>I am a transvestite, with bad makeup and other people's clothes, a used sparkle.</t6916>
<t6917>I wish I had a toothbrush.</t6917>
<t6918>I could stand here and ponder over this, but time is slipping away.</t6918>
<t6919>I must return home before midnight; otherwise, I will turn into a pumpkin, or was it the carriage that turned?</t6919> <t6920>Tomorrow is the Night of the Ceremony, according to the calendar, Serena wants me to prepare tonight; moreover, if I am not there, she will investigate the reason, and then what?</t6920>
<t6921>This time the Commander is waiting; I can hear him pacing up and down in the room.</t6921> <t6922>Now he pauses outside the bathroom door, clears his throat, an actor-like ahem.</t6922> <t6923>I turn on the hot water tap, to imply that I am ready or something similar.</t6923> <t6924>I wash my hands.</t6924> <t6925>I must avoid standing still.</t6925>
<t6926>When I go outside, I find him lying in the big bed, and I notice that he has taken off his shoes.</t6926> <t6927>I lie down next to him, it doesn't need to be said.</t6927> <t6928>If it were up to me, I wouldn't want to; but lying down feels good, I'm so tired.</t6928>
<t6929>In the end, we are alone, I think.</t6929> <t6930>The truth is, I don't want to be alone with him, not in a bed.</t6930> <t6931>I would have preferred Serena to be here too.</t6931> <t6932>I would have preferred to play Scrabble.</t6932>
<t6933>But my silence doesn't deter him.</t6933> <t6934>"Tomorrow, right?" he says softly.</t6934> <t6935>"It seems to me we could act a bit early."</t6935> <t6936>He turns to me.</t6936>
<t6937>“Why did you bring me here?” I ask coldly.</t6937> <t6938>Now, as they said, they are caressing my body from head to toe, light caresses from the left side to the left leg.</t6938> <t6939>When they reach the foot, they stop, their fingers encircle the ankle, briefly, like a bracelet, the place where the tattoo is, readable like Braille, a cattle brand.</t6939> <t6940>This signifies ownership.</t6940>
<t6941>I remind myself that he is not a rude man; under different circumstances, I also liked him.</t6941>
<t6942>Eli hesitates.</t6942> <t6943>“I thought you might like this as a change.”</t6943> <t6944>He knows it's not enough.</t6944> <t6945>“I guess it was some kind of experiment.”</t6945> <t6946>That’s not enough either.</t6946> <t6947>“You said you wanted to know.</t6947><t6948>”</t6948>
<t6949>Sitting down, he starts to unbutton.</t6949> <t6950>Will it get worse, stripping him of all this clothing power?</t6950> <t6951>He reached the shirt; then, underneath, a sad, small belly.</t6951> <t6952>A few tufts of hair.</t6952>
<t6953>He pulls down one of my straps, slides his other hand among the feathers, but it doesn't work, I lie there like a dead bird.</t6953> <t6954>He's not a monster, I think.</t6954> <t6955>I can't afford pride or hatred, there are things that must be given up, under certain conditions.</t6955>
<t6956>“Maybe I should turn off the lights,” says the Commander, in a weary and undoubtedly disappointed manner.</t6956> <t6957>Before he does that, I see him for a moment.</t6957> <t6958>Without his uniform, he looks smaller, older, like something dried up.</t6958> <t6959>The problem is, I can't be with him in a different way than ever before.</t6959> <t6960>Usually, the situation I am in is one of immobility.</t6960> <t6961>Of course, there must be something here for us, something different from this uselessness and baseness.</t6961>
<t6962>Pose, I shout to myself inside my mind.</t6962> <t6963>You must remember how to do it.</t6963> <t6964>Let's finish this, or you'll stay here all night.</t6964> <t6965>Get yourself moving.</t6965> <t6966>Twist your body, breathe audibly.</t6966> <t6967>At least you can do this.</t6967>
<t6968>Thirteen</t6968>
<t6969>Night</t6969>
<t6970>40</t6970>
<t6971>The night heat is worse than the daytime heat.</t6971> <t6972>Even if the fan is running, nothing stirs, the walls store the heat and give it back like a used oven.</t6972> <t6973>It's certain that it will rain soon.</t6973> <t6974>Why do I want it to rain?</t6974> <t6975>It will only mean more humidity.</t6975> <t6976>Lightning flashes in the distance, but there's no thunder.</t6976> <t6977>When I look out the window, I can see it like phosphorescence on a wavy sea, a glimmer behind the cloud-covered, very low and dull gray infrared-colored sky.</t6977> <t6978>The spotlights are off, this is unusual.</t6978> <t6979>A power outage.</t6979> <t6980>Or Serena Joy arranged this.</t6980>
<t6981>I'm sitting in the dark; there's no point in turning on the light, in announcing the fact that I'm still awake.</t6981> <t6982>I put on my entirely red clothes again, after removing the sequins and wiping off the lipstick with toilet paper.</t6982> <t6983>I hope nothing is noticeable, I hope neither his nor the Commander's scent has clung to me.</t6983>
<t6984>As she said, Serena is here at midnight.</t6984> <t6985>I can hear her, a faint rustle before she softly taps on the door, a slight scraping sound on the suffocating carpet of the corridor.</t6985> <t6986>I don't say anything, but I follow her down the hall and the stairs.</t6986> <t6987>She can walk faster, stronger than I thought.</t6987> <t6988>Her left hand grips the banister, perhaps with pain but enduring it, supporting herself.</t6988> <t6989>She bites her lip, she's in pain, I think.</t6989> <t6990>Yes, she really wants this baby.</t6990> <t6991>As we go down, I see the two of us in the short glass of the mirror, one blue and one red figure.</t6991>
<t6992>We are leaving the kitchen and going outside.</t6992> <t6993>The kitchen is empty, a night light has been left on; it has that silence peculiar to empty kitchens at night.</t6993> <t6994>The containers, boxes, and earthenware bowls on the counter look round and heavy due to the shadowy light.</t6994> <t6995>The knives have been put away on the wooden shelves.</t6995>
<t6996>“I will not come outside with you,” she whispers.</t6996> <t6997>It's strange to hear her whispering as if she were one of us.</t6997> <t6998>Usually, the Wives do not lower their voices.</t6998> <t6999>“You will go out the door and turn right.</t6999> <t7000>There is another door there, open.</t7000> <t7001>Go up the stairs and knock on the door, they are waiting for you.</t7001> <t7002>Nobody will see you.</t7002> <t7003>I will sit here.”</t7003> <t7004>So she will wait for me, in case something goes wrong; if Cora and Rita, for some unknown reason, wake up and come into the kitchen from their rooms at the back.</t7004> <t7005>What will she tell them?</t7005> <t7006>That she couldn't sleep.</t7006> <t7007>That she wanted some warm milk.</t7007> <t7008>I can tell she will be good at making up lies.</t7008>
<t7009>“Commander, upstairs, in the bedroom,” he says.</t7009> <t7010>“He wouldn't come down this late, he never does this.”</t7010> <t7011>That's what he thinks.</t7011>
<t7012>I open the kitchen door, step out, and wait for my eyes to adjust.</t7012> <t7013>It's been such a long time since I went out alone at night.</t7013> <t7014>The thunder is now audible, the storm is approaching.</t7014> <t7015>I wonder how he dealt with the guards?</t7015> <t7016>I could be shot as a thief.</t7016> <t7017>I hope he bribed them with something: cigarettes, whiskey, or maybe they know everything, the breeding farm, maybe if that doesn't work, he'll try them next time.</t7017>
<t7018>The door to the garage is just a few steps away.</t7018> <t7019>I walk, my feet silent on the grass, quickly open the door and slip inside.</t7019> <t7020>The stair landing is dark, too dark to see.</t7020> <t7021>Upwards, feeling my way, step by step, I find my way.</t7021> <t7022>There's a carpet here, I think, it's cork-colored.</t7022> <t7023>This must have once been an apartment; for a student, a young bachelor with a job.</t7023> <t7024>Many of the large houses around had these.</t7024> <t7025>Bachelor room, studio; these were the names of such apartments.</t7025> <t7026>I like being able to remember this.</t7026> <t7027>Separate entrance, the ads would say, and this meant you could have sex without being watched.</t7027>
<t7028>Reaching the end of the stairs, I knock on the door there.</t7028> <t7029>He opens the door himself, who else was I expecting?</t7029> <t7030>A lamp is on, just one, but there's enough light to make me blink.</t7030> <t7031>I look beyond him, hoping not to meet his eyes.</t7031> <t7032>It's a single room, with a pull-out couch, opened; in the far corner, there's a small kitchen counter and another door that should lead to the bathroom.</t7032> <t7033>This room is bare, military, minimal.</t7033> <t7034>No pictures on the walls.</t7034> <t7035>No flowers.</t7035> <t7036>It's as if he's camping.</t7036> <t7037>The blanket on the bed is gray and has U.</t7037> <t7038>S. written on it.</t7038>
<t7039>He steps back to let me pass, turning slightly to the side.</t7039> <t7040>His shirt on his back, a burning cigarette in his hand.</t7040> <t7041>I smell the smoke on him, in the warm air of the room and everywhere.</t7041> <t7042>I wish I could take off my clothes, bathe in this scent, rub it on my skin.</t7042>
<t7043>There is no prior affection; he knows why I am here.</t7043> <t7044>He does not utter a single word, why waste time, this is a duty.</t7044> <t7045>He moves away from me and turns off the lamp.</t7045> <t7046>Outside, like a punctuation mark, a flash of lightning; almost without a pause, thunder is heard afterward.</t7046> <t7047>He undresses me, a man made of darkness, I cannot see his face, I am barely breathing, barely standing, and I am no longer standing.</t7047> <t7048>His mouth on me, his hands, I cannot wait and he moves, already, love, it has been so long, I am alive within my skin, again, my arms wrap around him, a fall and water softly covering everything, unending.</t7048> <t7049>I know that such a thing can only happen once.</t7049>
<t7050>I made this up.</t7050> <t7051>It didn't happen this way.</t7051> <t7052>Here is what happened:</t7052>
<t7053>I reach the top of the stairs and knock on the door.</t7053> <t7054>He opens the door himself.</t7054> <t7055>A lamp turns on, and I blink my eyes.</t7055> <t7056>I look beyond his eyes; this is a single-person room, bare, with a military-made bed.</t7056> <t7057>No pictures, but the blanket has U.</t7057> <t7058>S. written on it.</t7058> <t7059>He's in his shirt, holding a cigarette.</t7059>
<t7060>“Al,” he says to me, “take a puff.”</t7060> <t7061>No small talk, he knows why I'm here.</t7061> <t7062>Being loaded, having problems, being heavily pregnant; it was always called like this once upon a time.</t7062> <t7063>I take the cigarette from him, take a deep puff, and give it back.</t7063> <t7064>Our fingers barely touch.</t7064> <t7065>Even this little bit of smoke makes my head spin.</t7065>
<t7066>He doesn't say anything, just looks at me, without smiling.</t7066> <t7067>If he had touched me, it would have been better, more friendly.</t7067> <t7068>I feel stupid and ugly, even though I know I'm neither.</t7068> <t7069>Still, what is he thinking, why doesn't he say anything?</t7069> <t7070>Maybe he thinks I'm fooling around, at Jezebel's Place, with the Commander or others.</t7070> <t7071>It even angers me to worry about what they think.</t7071> <t7072>Let's be practical.</t7072>
<t7073>“I don't have much time,” I say.</t7073> <t7074>I acted rudely and clumsily, that wasn't what I meant.</t7074>
<t7075>"I can empty into a bottle and you can pour into it," he says.</t7075> <t7076>He doesn't smile.</t7076>
<t7077>“There’s no need to be rude,” I say.</t7077> <t7078>Maybe she feels used.</t7078> <t7079>Maybe she wants something from me, a bit of emotion, an acknowledgment that she’s human too, that she’s more than just a seed envelope.</t7079> <t7080>“I know it’s hard for you,” I try.</t7080>
<t7081>He shrugs his shoulders.</t7081> <t7082>“I get what I deserve,” he says, with an empty retort.</t7082> <t7083>But he still doesn't move.</t7083>
<t7084>I'm getting my due, I'm laying you down, I rhyme in my mind.</t7084> <t7085>So, this is how we will do it.</t7085> <t7086>She didn't like the makeup and sequins.</t7086> <t7087>We will be strict.</t7087>
<t7088>"Do you come here often?"</t7088><t7089></t7089>
<t7090>“What is a good girl like me doing in a place like this?” I reply, and we both smile: this is better.</t7090> <t7091>This is to confirm that we are pretending, because what else can we do in such a situation?</t7091>
<t7092>“Abstinence spurs desire.”</t7092> <t7093>We are quoting from old movies belonging to a previous era.</t7093> <t7094>Those movies belonged to an even earlier time: Such conversations correspond to a date long before our own era.</t7094> <t7095>Even my mother wouldn't speak like that, at least not as long as I've known her.</t7095> <t7096>Maybe no one ever spoke like that in real life, it was all a lie from the beginning.</t7096> <t7097>Still, how surprising it is that it comes to mind so easily, I understand now what purpose this stereotypical and artificial joke, peculiar to homos, served, what it has always served: to keep one's essence distant; closed, protected.</t7097>
<t7098>Now I am sad, the way we speak is extremely melancholic: lost music, faded paper flowers, worn satin, an echo of an echo.</t7098> <t7099>Everything is gone, now impossible.</t7099> <t7100>I start crying out of the blue.</t7100>
<t7101>Finally, he moves towards me, wraps his arms around me, strokes my back, holds me in this way, to comfort me.</t7101>
<t7102>“Come on,” he says.</t7102> <t7103>“We don't have much time.”</t7103> <t7104>With his arm around my shoulder, he takes me to the pull-out couch and lays me down.</t7104> <t7105>He even opens the blanket first.</t7105> <t7106>He starts undressing me, then caressing me, kissing my ear.</t7106> <t7107>“No romance,” he says.</t7107> <t7108>“Okay?</t7108><t7109>”</t7109>
<t7110>It had a different meaning once, a long time ago.</t7110> <t7111>The meaning back then: no restrictions.</t7111> <t7112>The current meaning: no exaggerations.</t7112> <t7113>The meaning: don't risk yourself for me, if it comes to that.</t7113>
<t7114>And so it goes.</t7114> <t7115>And so.</t7115>
<t7116>I knew it could only happen once.</t7116> <t7117>Goodbye, I thought, even then, goodbye.</t7117>
<t7118>There was no thunder either, I had added this.</t7118> <t7119>To cover up the sounds I was ashamed to make.</t7119>
<t7120>It didn't happen like that.</t7120> <t7121>I'm not sure exactly how it happened.</t7121> <t7122>My only hope is in a revival: feeling love is always just an approximation.</t7122>
<t7123>Halfway, I thought of Serena Joy, sitting downstairs in the kitchen.</t7123> <t7124>Thinking: cheap.</t7124> <t7125>They spread their legs for everyone.</t7125> <t7126>The only thing you need to give them is a cigarette.</t7126>
<t7127>And then I thought: This is a betrayal.</t7127> <t7128>Not the act itself, but my reaction.</t7128> <t7129>If I knew for certain that he was dead, would it matter?</t7129>
<t7130>I wish I were shameless.</t7130> <t7131>I wish I were unashamed.</t7131> <t7132>I wish I were ignorant.</t7132> <t7133>That way, I wouldn't know how ignorant I am.</t7133>
<t7134>14</t7134>
<t7135>Salvation</t7135>
<t7136>41</t7136>
<t7137>I wish this story were different.</t7137> <t7138>I wish it were more civilized.</t7138> <t7139>I wish it, if not happier, at least showed me in a better light, then at least more active, less hesitant, less hindered by trivial things.</t7139> <t7140>I wish it were more structured.</t7140> <t7141>And I wish it were about love or significant sudden realizations in human life, even about sunsets, birds, storms, or snow.</t7141>
<t7142>Perhaps it is about all these things, in a way; but meanwhile, there are many other things happening, a bunch of whispers, a bunch of speculations about others, a bunch of rumors that cannot be proven true, a bunch of unspoken words, sneaky movements around, and a bunch of secrecy.</t7142> <t7143>Moreover, there is a bunch of time to endure, a time as heavy as fried foods or a thick fog; and then, in otherwise familiar, maternal, and somnolent streets, anarchic events that suddenly appear like explosions.</t7143>
<t7144>I'm sorry that there is so much pain in this story.</t7144> <t7145>I'm also sorry that it is fragmented, like a body caught in crossfire or forcibly torn apart.</t7145> <t7146>Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do to change it.</t7146>
<t7147>I tried to put good things inside as well, though.</t7147> <t7148>Flowers, for example, because without them, where would we be?</t7148>
<t7149>Despite everything, telling it over and over again hurts me.</t7149> <t7150>Once was enough: Wasn't once enough back then?</t7150> <t7151>Yet I continue to live with this sorrowful and hungry and miserable, this limping and crippled story, because I want you to listen, after all, just as I will listen to yours, if I get the chance, that is, if I meet you or if you run away, in the future or in Heaven or underground, somewhere else.</t7151> <t7152>The common point is that they are not here.</t7152> <t7153>By telling you something out of nothing, at least I believe in you, I believe that you are there, by believing I create you.</t7153> <t7154>By telling you this story, I also determine your existence.</t7154> <t7155>I tell, therefore you are.</t7155>
<t7156>That's why I will continue.</t7156> <t7157>That's why I will push myself to keep going.</t7157> <t7158>I'm coming to a part you won't like at all, you won't like it because in this section, without behaving appropriately, I will try not to skip anything no matter what.</t7158> <t7159>After all, you've come this far, you have the right to hear whatever is left of this story; there's not much left, but it contains the truth.</t7159>
<t7160>So, here is the story.</t7160>
<t7161>I went to Nick again.</t7161> <t7162>Again and again, on my own, without Serena knowing.</t7162> <t7163>It wasn't wanted, there was no excuse.</t7163> <t7164>I did it not for him, but entirely for myself.</t7164> <t7165>I didn't even think of it as giving myself to him, because what did I have to give?</t7165> <t7166>Every time he let me in, I didn't feel generous, but grateful.</t7166> <t7167>He didn't have to do it.</t7167>
<t7168>I became reckless to do this, I took advantage of unlikely opportunities.</t7168> <t7169>After being with the Commander, I would go upstairs as usual, but then I would go down the back stairs of the Marthas by following the corridor and go to him through the kitchen.</t7169> <t7170>Each time, I would almost turn back when I heard the click of the kitchen door closing behind me, it sounded very metallic to my ears, like a mouse trap or a gunshot, but I wouldn't turn back.</t7170> <t7171>At any moment, expecting to feel the bullets piercing me even before their sounds, I would hurriedly cross the few meters of illuminated lawn, the spotlights had been turned on again.</t7171> <t7172>I would find my way by touch on the dark stairs and lean against the door to rest, the thumping of my blood in my ears.</t7172> <t7173>Fear is a powerful stimulant.</t7173> <t7174>Then I would knock on the door slowly, like a beggar knocking.</t7174> <t7175>Each time I would expect him to be gone; or, worse, to tell me I couldn't come in.</t7175> <t7176>He could tell me that he would no longer break the rules, that he would no longer play with fire.</t7176> <t7177>Or, even worse, he could tell me that he was no longer interested.</t7177> <t7178>His ineptitude at doing any of these things was the most incredible experience of benevolence and luck I had ever lived through.</t7178>
<t7179>I told you it was bad.</t7179>
<t7180>Here's how the story goes.</t7180>
<t7181>He is opening the door.</t7181> <t7182>He is only wearing a shirt, not tucked in, its tails hanging freely; he has a toothbrush in his hand or a cigarette or a glass with something to drink in it.</t7182> <t7183>He has a small, mysterious storage here, I think it's for black market goods.</t7183> <t7184>He always has something in his hand, as if continuing his life as usual, not expecting my arrival, not waiting for me.</t7184> <t7185>Maybe he really isn't expecting or waiting.</t7185> <t7186>Maybe he doesn't have a concept of the future or doesn't bother to imagine it or doesn't dare to.</t7186>
<t7187>"Is it too late?" I say.</t7187>
<t7188>He shakes his head to say no.</t7188> <t7189>So far, there has been an agreement between us that it is never too late, yet I still show the courtesy of asking.</t7189> <t7190>It gives me the feeling of being more in control of the situation, as if there is a choice that can be made, a decision that can be taken, one way or another.</t7190> <t7191>He steps aside, I pass by him and enter inside, and he closes the door.</t7191> <t7192>Then he turns off the light.</t7192> <t7193>We don't talk much anymore, at least at this stage.</t7193> <t7194>I'm already half undressed.</t7194> <t7195>We leave the conversation for later.</t7195>
<t7196>When I'm with the Commander, I close my eyes, even when giving a goodnight kiss.</t7196> <t7197>I don't want to see him that close.</t7197> <t7198>But now, here, every time, I keep my eyes open.</t7198> <t7199>I wish there was a light somewhere, maybe a candle, placed on top of a bottle, something echoing the college, but such a thing would be too risky; so I have to make do with the projector light, the glow of the projector light filtering through the same white curtains as mine.</t7199> <t7200>I want to see the things that can be seen, about him, to take him in, to memorize him, to keep him inside me, so I can make do with that image later: the contours of his body, the texture of his skin, the sheen of sweat on his skin, his long, mocking, and inscrutable face.</t7200> <t7201>I should have done this with Luke too, paying more attention to the details, the moles and spots, the odd lines; but I didn't, and now he's fading away.</t7201> <t7202>Day by day, night by night, he's disappearing, and I am becoming more unfaithful.</t7202>
<t7203>I would wear pink feathers, purple stars, if that was what he wanted; or anything else, even a rabbit's tail.</t7203> <t7204>However, he doesn't need such decorations.</t7204> <t7205>Every time we make love, it's as if we both know, without the slightest doubt, that there will never be another time with anyone else, ever again.</t7205> <t7206>And then, when a new time comes, it is always a surprise, an extra, a blessing for us.</t7206>
<t7207>It's safe to be here with him; while the storm rages outside, we huddle together in a nook.</t7207> <t7208>This is an illusion, no doubt.</t7208> <t7209>One of the most dangerous places I could be is this room.</t7209> <t7210>If I were caught there, they would show no mercy, but I've already crossed the threshold of caring.</t7210> <t7211>And how did I come to trust him so much, isn't this a kind of wild bravery in itself?</t7211> <t7212>How can I pretend to know him or the slightest thing about him and what he really does?</t7212>
<t7213>I dispel these restless whispers.</t7213> <t7214>I talk too much.</t7214> <t7215>I tell him things I shouldn't tell.</t7215> <t7216>I talk about Moira, about the one from Glen; though I don't talk about Luke.</t7216> <t7217>I want to mention the woman in my room to him, the woman who was there before me, but I don't.</t7217> <t7218>I am jealous of that woman.</t7218> <t7219>If she was here before me, in this bed, I don't want to hear it.</t7219>
<t7220>I tell her my real name and from then on, I feel known.</t7220> <t7221>I am acting like a fool.</t7221> <t7222>I should have acted more wisely.</t7222> <t7223>I am turning her into an idol, a cardboard silhouette.</t7223>
<t7224>But he speaks little: he no longer makes convoluted remarks or jokes.</t7224> <t7225>He barely asks questions.</t7225> <t7226>He seems indifferent to most of what I have to say, as if only sensitive to the possibilities my body offers, yet he watches me while I speak.</t7226> <t7227>He watches my face.</t7227>
<t7228>It is not possible to think that someone for whom I have such a feeling of gratitude could betray me.</t7228>
<t7229>Neither of us utters the word love, not even once.</t7229> <t7230>It would be defying fate: it would be romance, bad luck.</t7230>
<t7231>Today there are different flowers, drier, more distinct, warm summer flowers: daisies, yellow daisies similar to ox-eye daisies, surprising us on the long and sloping road going downwards.</t7231> <t7232>I see them in the gardens, while walking up and down with Gleninki.</t7232> <t7233>I don't pay much attention to what they say, I don't trust them anymore.</t7233> <t7234>The things they whisper to me seem unreal.</t7234> <t7235>What use are they to me now?</t7235>
<t7236>You can enter his room at night, he says.</t7236> <t7237>Rummage through his desk.</t7237> <t7238>There should be documents, notes.</t7238>
<t7239>The door is locked, I mutter.</t7239>
<t7240>We can find you a key, he says.</t7240> <t7241>Don't you want to know who he is, what he does?</t7241>
<t7242>However, the Commander is no longer a source of false interest for me.</t7242> <t7243>I have to make an effort not to show my indifference towards him.</t7243>
<t7244>Continue doing everything exactly as you did before, says Nick.</t7244> <t7245>Don't change anything.</t7245> <t7246>Otherwise, they will understand.</t7246> <t7247>He kisses me, constantly watching me.</t7247> <t7248>Promise? Don't make a mistake.</t7248>
<t7249>I place my hand on my belly.</t7249> <t7250>It's done, I say.</t7250> <t7251>I feel that it's done.</t7251> <t7252>In two weeks, I will be sure.</t7252>
<t7253>I am aware that this is my own wishful thinking.</t7253>
<t7254>The commander will love you until he dies, he says.</t7254> <t7255>So will Serena.</t7255>
<t7256>But I say, it's you.</t7256> <t7257>It will be from you, truly.</t7257> <t7258>I want it to be that way.</t7258>
<t7259>We are not after this, though.</t7259>
<t7260>I can't do it, I tell Gleninki.</t7260> <t7261>I'm very scared.</t7261> <t7262>Besides, I wouldn't be able to do it; I'd get caught.</t7262>
<t7263>I'm not really bothering to look unhappy; I've become that lazy.</t7263>
<t7264>We can take you outside, he says.</t7264> <t7265>If we are really obligated, we can take people outside, if they are in danger.</t7265> <t7266>In imminent danger.</t7266>
<t7267>The truth is, I no longer want to leave, escape, or cross the border to freedom.</t7267> <t7268>Here, where I can reach him, I want to be with Nick.</t7268>
<t7269>I feel ashamed of myself while telling this.</t7269> <t7270>But there is more to it than that.</t7270> <t7271>Even now, I realize that this acceptance is a kind of boasting.</t7271> <t7272>There is pride in it because it reveals how extreme and justified it is for me.</t7272> <t7273>How much it was worth it.</t7273> <t7274>It resembles stories about the diseases you have recovered from and the deadly situations you have escaped; war stories.</t7274> <t7275>These kinds of stories exhibit seriousness.</t7275>
<t7276>In that case, such seriousness in a man had never seemed possible to me before.</t7276>
<t7277>Some days I was more rational.</t7277> <t7278>I wasn't putting it into words of love, for my own sake.</t7278> <t7279>I was telling myself that I was building a life for myself here, a kind of life.</t7279> <t7280>This must have been the thought of immigrant blood and of women who survived wars, if they still had a man, of course.</t7280> <t7281>Human beings get used to everything, my mother used to say.</t7281> <t7282>As long as there are a few things to fill the void, it’s truly surprising what people can get used to.</t7282>
<t7283>It won't take very long, says Cora, while giving me my monthly sanitary pad ration.</t7283> <t7284>It won't take long, she says, smiling shyly but understandingly.</t7284> <t7285>Does she know?</t7285> <t7286>Are she and Rita aware of what I do, sneaking down the stairs at night?</t7286> <t7287>Am I giving myself away, smiling lost in dreams, lightly touching my face when I think they aren't looking?</t7287>
<t7288>Gleninki is also losing hope in me.</t7288> <t7289>She whispers less and talks more about trivial things.</t7289> <t7290>That's why I don't feel regret.</t7290> <t7291>What I feel is relief.</t7291>
<t7292>42</t7292>
<t7293>The bell is ringing, we can hear its sound from quite a distance.</t7293> <t7294>It's morning, we haven't had breakfast yet.</t7294> <t7295>When we reach the main gate, we walk in line, two by two.</t7295> <t7296>There is a regiment of guards and special-duty Angels, equipped for riot control - helmets with dark visors that make them look like insects, long batons, tear gas launchers - they have formed a cordon outside the Wall.</t7296> <t7297>This is for a riot situation.</t7297> <t7298>The hooks on the Wall are empty.</t7298>
<t7299>This is a regional Liberation Ritual, only for women.</t7299> <t7300>Liberation Rituals are always conducted separately.</t7300> <t7301>It was reported yesterday.</t7301> <t7302>They announce it just one day before.</t7302> <t7303>There isn't enough time to get accustomed to it.</t7303>
<t7304>Walking towards the sound of the bell, we pass by the buildings that once housed lecture halls and dormitories, along the paths once used by students.</t7304> <t7305>It's very strange to be here again.</t7305> <t7306>From the outside, you couldn't say this or that has changed, except for the shutters being down on most of the windows.</t7306> <t7307>These buildings now belong to the Eyes.</t7307>
<t7308>We walk in a line towards the wide lawn in front of the building that used to be a library.</t7308> <t7309>The white stairs leading up are still the same, the main entrance has not been closed.</t7309> <t7310>There is a wooden stage set up on the lawn, similar to what they used to use for the Graduation Ceremony every spring in the previous era.</t7310> <t7311>Hats come to mind, pastel-colored hats worn by some mothers, black capes worn by students, and red capes.</t7311> <t7312>However, this stage is not the same at all, because of the three wooden poles standing on it with nooses hanging from them.</t7312>
<t7313>There is a microphone in front of the cream; the television camera is cautiously turned to another side.</t7313>
<t7314>I had attended only one of these, two years ago.</t7314> <t7315>The Women's Liberation Ceremony is not held frequently.</t7315> <t7316>There is less and less need for them.</t7316> <t7317>These days we are very well-behaved.</t7317>
<t7318>I do not want to tell this story.</t7318>
<t7319>We take our places in the standard arrangement: Wives and daughters sit on foldable wooden chairs placed towards the back, Econowives and Marthas are in the corners and on the library stairs, while Handmaids are at the front, in a place where everyone can observe us.</t7319> <t7320>We do not sit on chairs but kneel, though this time we have cushions, small red velvet cushions with nothing written on them, not even Faith.</t7320>
<t7321>By chance, the weather is good: not very hot, partly cloudy.</t7321> <t7322>Kneeling in the rain here would have been bad.</t7322> <t7323>Maybe that's why they delay telling us so much: so they understand what the weather will be like.</t7323> <t7324>It's as good a reason as any that could be proposed.</t7324>
<t7325>I kneel on my red velvet cushion.</t7325> <t7326>I try to think about tonight, the lovemaking, in the dark, in the light reflected on the white walls.</t7326> <t7327>I remember being embraced.</t7327>
<t7328>There is a long rope coiling like a snake in front of the first row of cushions, passing the second row and extending between the rows of chairs at the back; it curls backward like a very old, very slow-flowing river seen from above.</t7328> <t7329>The rope is thick, brown, and smells of tar.</t7329> <t7330>The front end of the rope goes towards the stage.</t7330> <t7331>It resembles a fuse or the ties of a balloon.</t7331>
<t7332>On the stage, to the left, stand those who are to be rescued: two Handmaids and a Wife.</t7332> <t7333>It's not very common to see Wives, and I can't help but look at her with interest.</t7333> <t7334>I want to know what she is doing.</t7334>
<t7335>They were placed here before the doors were opened.</t7335> <t7336>They are all sitting on folding wooden chairs, like students about to receive their graduation awards.</t7336> <t7337>Their hands rest in their laps, as if calmly clasped together.</t7337> <t7338>They sway a little, perhaps they have been given an injection or a pill, so they won't cause a commotion.</t7338> <t7339>It's better if everything goes smoothly.</t7339> <t7340>Are they tied to their chairs, I wonder?</t7340> <t7341>It's hard to tell while they're in all this pile of fabric.</t7341>
<t7342>Now the official procession is approaching the stage, they are climbing the stairs on the right side: three women, an Aunt in front, and two Guardians in black hoods and cloaks a step behind her.</t7342> <t7343>Other Aunts are coming behind them.</t7343> <t7344>The whispers among us cease.</t7344> <t7345>The leading trio lines up and turns towards us, the two Guardians in black clothing flank the Aunt on either side.</t7345>
<t7346>This is Aunt Lydia.</t7346> <t7347>How many years has it been since I last saw her?</t7347> <t7348>I had started to think she existed only in my mind, but there she is, a little older, that's all.</t7348> <t7349>My vision is good; I can see the deepening wrinkles on either side of her nose, the frown etched into her face.</t7349> <t7350>She blinks her eyes, smiles nervously, glances around, assessing the audience; she raises her hand to adjust her headpiece.</t7350> <t7351>A strange sound comes from the Public Address system, a sound like someone being strangled: she clears her throat.</t7351>
<t7352>I started to tremble.</t7352> <t7353>Hatred fills my mouth like saliva.</t7353>
<t7354>The sun is rising, the stage and those on it are bathed in light like a Christmas scene.</t7354> <t7355>I can make out the wrinkles under Aunt Lydia's eyes, the pallor of the seated women, the fringes of the rope on the grass in front of me, the blades of grass.</t7355> <t7356>There is a dandelion flower right in front of me, the color of egg yolk.</t7356> <t7357>I feel hunger.</t7357> <t7358>The sound of the bell stops.</t7358>
<t7359>Aunt Lydia stands up, straightens her skirts with both hands, and steps forward to the microphone.</t7359> <t7360>“Good afternoon, ladies,” she says, and a simultaneous and ear-piercing static comes from the Public Address system.</t7360> <t7361>Amazingly, there is laughter among us.</t7361> <t7362>It's hard not to laugh, caused by the tense and uncomfortable expression that appears on Aunt Lydia's face as she adjusts her voice.</t7362> <t7363>She is supposed to be dignified, though.</t7363>
<t7364>“Good afternoon, ladies,” he says again, his voice now tinny and dull.</t7364> <t7365>Since there are also spouses present, he says ladies instead of girls.</t7365> <t7366>“We are all, undoubtedly, aware of the unfortunate circumstances that have brought us together here on this beautiful morning, when I am sure all of us, myself included, would prefer to be doing something else.</t7366> <t7367>However, duty is a harsh taskmaster, or perhaps I should say taskmistress in this case, and we are here today in the name of duty.</t7367><t7368>”</t7368>
<t7369>It continues like this for a few minutes, but I'm not listening.</t7369> <t7370>I've heard enough of these or similar talks before: the same bland words, the same slogans, the same expressions: the torch of the future, the preservation of the race, the duty ahead, and so on.</t7370> <t7371>After this speech, it's hard to believe that tea and cookies won't be served on the lawn following a light applause.</t7371>
<t7372>This was the introduction, I think.</t7372> <t7373>Now he will get to the point.</t7373>
<t7374>Aunt Lydia reaches into her pocket and rummages around, pulling out a crumpled piece of paper.</t7374> <t7375>Straightening it out and glancing at it takes longer than necessary.</t7375> <t7376>In this way, she shoves it in our faces, making sure we understand exactly who she is, forcing us to watch her silently as she reads, flaunting her privileges.</t7376> <t7377>Disgusting, I think.</t7377> <t7378>Let's just get this over with.</t7378>
<t7379>“In the past,” says Aunt Lydia, “it became customary for a detailed account of the crimes to precede the Salvaging after the convicts were found guilty.</t7379> <t7380>However, we found that such a narration in front of everyone, especially when shown on television, invariably led to a boldness, if the term is correct, actually an explosion, in committing exactly the same crimes.</t7380> <t7381>Therefore, we decided to put an end to this practice for the good of everyone.</t7381> <t7382>The Salvaging will be conducted without further ado.</t7382><t7383>”</t7383>
<t7384>A collective murmur rises from our side.</t7384> <t7385>The crimes committed by others are a secret language among us.</t7385> <t7386>After all, we show ourselves what we are capable of through them.</t7386> <t7387>It means there won't be an explanation in front of everyone.</t7387> <t7388>On the other hand, nothing can be understood from Aunt Lydia's stance, smiling and blinking as if being washed with applause.</t7388> <t7389>Now we are left to our own devices, to our own speculations.</t7389> <t7390>The first woman, now lifted from her chair, black-gloved hands clinging to her arm: reading?</t7390> <t7391>No, the punishment for that is cutting off hands, and that on the third offense.</t7391> <t7392>Indecency, or an attempt on the Commander's life?</t7392> <t7393>Or, more precisely, on the Commander's Wife's life.</t7393> <t7394>These are what come to our minds.</t7394> <t7395>As for the Wife; there is usually only one thing they are saved from.</t7395> <t7396>Although they can do almost anything to us, they are not allowed to kill us, at least not legally.</t7396> <t7397>With a knitting needle or garden shears, if not that, a knife stolen from the kitchen, especially when we are pregnant, it is strictly forbidden for them to do this job.</t7397> <t7398>It could also be adultery, of course.</t7398> <t7399>It could always be that.</t7399>
<t7400>Or maybe he had tried to escape.</t7400>
<t7401>“Charlesinki,” Aunt Lydia announces.</t7401> <t7402>Not someone I know.</t7402> <t7403>The woman is brought forward; she walks as if she is really concentrating on the task, one step, then another: it is obvious she is sedated.</t7403> <t7404>She has a crooked drunken smile on her mouth.</t7404> <t7405>One side of her face is twitching, an irregular blink, directed at the camera.</t7405> <t7406>They will certainly never show this, it's not live broadcast.</t7406> <t7407>Two Guardians are tying her hands, behind her.</t7407>
<t7408>I hear retching sounds coming from somewhere behind me.</t7408>
<t7409>That's why we don't have breakfast.</t7409>
<t7410>“It's most likely Janine,” Gleninki whispers.</t7410>
<t7411>I've seen this before, a white bag placed over the head, the woman is helped onto a high stool as if climbing the steps of a bus, she is fixed there, the noose is carefully adjusted around her neck like a robe, the stool is kicked away.</t7411> <t7412>I hear the long sigh surrounding me, a sigh like the air escaping from an air mattress, I notice Aunt Lydia pressing her hand against the microphone to prevent the other sounds from being heard, I lean forward to touch the rope in front of me, at the same time as the others, touching it with both hands, sticky with tar melting in the hot air, the frayed rope, then I place one hand over my heart to show my unity and approval with the Rescuers, my complicity in this woman's death.</t7412> <t7413>I see her legs kicking the air and the pair in black grabbing them and pulling down with all their strength.</t7413> <t7414>I don't want to see anymore.</t7414> <t7415>I look at the grass instead.</t7415> <t7416>I describe the rope.</t7416>
<t7417>43</t7417>
<t7418>Three bodies are hanging there, with white bags pulled over their heads that seem oddly spread out, like chickens hanging by their necks in a butcher's window; like clipped-wing birds, flightless birds, like angels accidentally fallen to earth.</t7418> <t7419>It's hard to take one's eyes off them.</t7419> <t7420>Feet dangle beneath the folds of the clothes, two pairs of red shoes, and one pair of blue shoes.</t7420> <t7421>If it weren't for the ropes and bags, it could be likened to a kind of dance, a ballet, caught in the flash of a camera: suspended in the air.</t7421> <t7422>They look as if they have been specially arranged.</t7422> <t7423>They look as if they belong to the world of spectacle.</t7423> <t7424>It must be Aunt Lydia who put the one in blue there.</t7424>
<t7425>“Today's Salvation Ceremony has ended,” Aunt Lydia announces from the microphone.</t7425> <t7426>“However...</t7426><t7427>”</t7427>
<t7428>We turn towards her, we listen to her, we watch her.</t7428> <t7429>She has always known how to use pauses.</t7429> <t7430>There is a ripple among us, a commotion.</t7430> <t7431>Maybe something else will happen.</t7431>
<t7432>“But you can stand up and form a circle.”</t7432> <t7433>He smiles at us, noble, extremely generous.</t7433> <t7434>About to give us something.</t7434> <t7435>About to bestow a favor.</t7435> <t7436>“Come on, be orderly.</t7436><t7437>”</t7437>
<t7438>He is addressing us, the Handmaids.</t7438> <t7439>Some Wives are leaving now, and some girls too.</t7439> <t7440>Most are staying, but they stay behind, far away, merely watching.</t7440> <t7441>They are not part of the circle.</t7441>
<t7442>Two guards stepped forward, gathering the thick rope and pulling it out from underfoot.</t7442> <t7443>The others are taking the cushions.</t7443> <t7444>Now, we are huddling together like sheep in the grassy area in front of the stage, some racing to secure a spot close to the center, while many others are making equal efforts to reach a place in the middle where they will be obscured.</t7444> <t7445>In any group like this, it is a clear mistake to stay at the back; it causes you to be labeled as lacking enthusiasm and uninterested.</t7445> <t7446>There is a concentrated energy here, a murmur, a thrill of alertness and anger.</t7446> <t7447>Bodies are tense, eyes brighter; just like taking aim.</t7447>
<t7448>I neither want to be in the front nor stay behind.</t7448> <t7449>I'm not sure what's ahead in line, though I sense it's not something I'd want to see up close.</t7449> <t7450>However, Glen is pulling me by the arm, and now we're in the second row, with only a thin pair of bodies in front of us.</t7450> <t7451>I don't want to see, yet I can't pull back either.</t7451> <t7452>I had heard rumors that I half-believed.</t7452> <t7453>Despite everything I've learned so far, I tell myself: they wouldn't go this far.</t7453>
<t7454>“You know the Joint-Execution rules,” says Aunt Lydia.</t7454> <t7455>“You will wait until I blow the whistle.</t7455> <t7456>What you do after that is up to you, until I blow the whistle again, of course.</t7456> <t7457>Understood?</t7457><t7458>”</t7458>
<t7459>A murmur arises from us, a shapeless approval.</t7459>
<t7460>“Well then,” says Aunt Lydia.</t7460> <t7461>She nods, and two guards, not the ones lifting the rope, this time come out from behind the stage.</t7461> <t7462>Between them, they are half carrying, half dragging a third man.</t7462> <t7463>He is also wearing a guard's uniform, but he has no hat, and his uniform is dirty and torn.</t7463> <t7464>His face is full of cuts and bruises, dark brick-colored bruises; his flesh is swollen and lumpy, his beard unshaven and long.</t7464> <t7465>He looks more like an unknown vegetable than a face, a bruised onion or a gnarled root, something that grew imperfectly.</t7465> <t7466>Even from where I am standing, I can smell him: the stench of feces and vomit.</t7466> <t7467>His hair is blond and falls over his face; what could have made it so matted?</t7467> <t7468>Dried sweat?</t7468>
<t7469>I look at him with a start.</t7469> <t7470>He looks like he's drunk.</t7470> <t7471>He looks like a drunk who just came out of a fight.</t7471> <t7472>Why did they bring a drunk here?</t7472>
<t7473>“This man,” says Aunt Lydia, “has been found guilty of rape.”</t7473> <t7474>Her voice trembles with anger, a kind of triumph.</t7474> <t7475>“He was once a Guardian.</t7475> <t7476>He stained his uniform.</t7476> <t7477>He betrayed the trust placed in him.</t7477> <t7478>His accomplice was shot dead beforehand.</t7478> <t7479>The penalty for rape, as you all know, is death.</t7479> <t7480>Deuteronomy, Chapter 22:23 - 2921.</t7480> <t7481>I can also add that this crime targeted two of you and was carried out under the threat of a weapon.</t7481> <t7482>This is also something inhuman.</t7482> <t7483>I will not hurt your ears with the details, I will only say that one of the women was pregnant and the baby died.</t7483><t7484>”</t7484>
<t7485>A murmur is coming from us; I feel that I can't stop myself from clenching my fists.</t7485> <t7486>This is too much, this violation.</t7486> <t7487>To also eliminate the baby, after all we've endured!</t7487> <t7488>To be honest, there is such a thing as bloodlust; I want to tear apart, gouge out eyes, rip apart.</t7488>
<t7489>We are pushing and shoving each other forward, our heads turning this way and that, our nostrils flaring like bellows, smelling the scent of death as we look at each other, what we see is hatred.</t7489> <t7490>To hit would be a mercy.</t7490> <t7491>The man's head is spinning like a drunkard's: did he hear it?</t7491>
<t7492>Aunt Lydia waits for a moment; then she smiles slightly and brings her whistle to her lips.</t7492> <t7493>We hear its sound, sharp and silvery, an echo from a volleyball game of the distant past.</t7493>
<t7494>The two guards release the third man's arms and step back.</t7494> <t7495>He staggers -drugged?- and falls to his knees.</t7495> <t7496>His eyes, as if the light is too bright for him, have dried and shriveled in the swollen flesh of his face.</t7496> <t7497>They have kept him in the dark.</t7497> <t7498>He reaches one hand to his cheek; as if to see if it is still there.</t7498> <t7499>All of this happens quickly, but it feels slow to a person.</t7499>
<t7500>Nobody is moving forward.</t7500> <t7501>The women are looking at him in horror; as if looking at a half-dead mouse crawling forward in the kitchen.</t7501> <t7502>He is squinting at us surrounding him, at the circle of red women.</t7502> <t7503>The corner of his mouth twitches upwards, an unbelievable thing - a smile?</t7503>
<t7504>I'm trying to see inside, to find out what it should really look like inside your battered face.</t7504> <t7505>I think he's in his thirties.</t7505> <t7506>Not Luke.</t7506>
<t7507>Still, it could have happened, I know this.</t7507> <t7508>It could have been Nick.</t7508> <t7509>No matter what he has done, I know I won't lay a hand on him.</t7509>
<t7510>He is saying something.</t7510> <t7511>His voice comes out muffled, as if his throat is decayed, his tongue feels too big for his mouth, yet I can still hear him.</t7511> <t7512>"I didn't do it..." he says.</t7512>
<t7513>There is a sudden surge forward, like the crowd at an old-time rock concert when the doors open, this necessity comes over us like a wave.</t7513><t7514>The air is charged with adrenaline, we are allowed to do anything and this is freedom itself, in my body too; I stagger drunkenly, red spreads everywhere, but this dress and body ebb and flow without hitting it, Glen's pushes the women in front of us, advancing by making way with his elbows, left, right, running towards it.</t7514><t7515>He tackles the man to the ground from the side, then hits his head hard, once, twice, three times, sharp and painful kicks, well-aimed.</t7515><t7516>Now there are sounds, gasping breaths, a low-pitched hum like a growl, screams, red bodies rolling forward and I can no longer see him; he disappears among the arms, fists, and feet.</t7516><t7517>A fierce scream comes from somewhere, the scream of a frightened horse.</t7517>
<t7518>I'm falling behind, struggling to stay on my feet.</t7518> <t7519>Something hits me from behind.</t7519> <t7520>I stumble.</t7520> <t7521>When I regain my balance and look around, I see the Wives and girls leaning forward in their chairs, and the Aunts on the platform looking down with interest.</t7521> <t7522>They must have a better view from up there.</t7522>
<t7523>Adam is now an object.</t7523>
<t7524>Gleninki is by my side again.</t7524> <t7525>His face is tense, expressionless.</t7525>
<t7526>“I saw what you did,” I say to him.</t7526> <t7527>Now I start to feel it again: shock, anger, nausea.</t7527> <t7528>Barbarity.</t7528> <t7529>“Why did you do this?</t7529> <t7530>You! I thought that you...</t7530><t7531>”</t7531>
<t7532>"Don't look at me," he says.</t7532> <t7533>"They are watching.</t7533><t7534>"</t7534>
<t7535>“I don't care,” I say.</t7535> <t7536>The tone of my voice is rising, I can't help it.</t7536>
<t7537>“Get a grip,” he says.</t7537> <t7538>He acts like he's brushing off my clothes, brings his face close to my ear.</t7538> <t7539>“Don't be stupid.</t7539> <t7540>He wasn't raped or anything, he was a political prisoner.</t7540> <t7541>He was one of us.</t7541> <t7542>I knocked him out.</t7542> <t7543>I saved him from his suffering.</t7543> <t7544>Don't you know what they did to him?</t7544><t7545>”</t7545>
<t7546>I think, one of us.</t7546> <t7547>A guard.</t7547> <t7548>This seems impossible to me.</t7548>
<t7549>Aunt Lydia blows her whistle again, but they don't stop immediately.</t7549> <t7550>Two guards step in between them and pull them apart, whatever is left of the man, some lie on the grass where they were accidentally hit or kicked.</t7550> <t7551>Some have fainted.</t7551> <t7552>They scatter away from the herd, in pairs, threes, or alone.</t7552> <t7553>They look mesmerized.</t7553>
<t7554>“Find your partners and form a line again,” says Aunt Lydia through the microphone.</t7554> <t7555>Very few people pay attention to her.</t7555> <t7556>One of the women is coming towards us, as if finding her way in the dark by feeling with her feet: Janine.</t7556> <t7557>There is a bloodstain along her chin, and even more on her headdress.</t7557> <t7558>She smiles, a bright little smile.</t7558> <t7559>Her eyes are glazed over.</t7559>
<t7560>“Hello,” he says.</t7560> <t7561>“How are you?” He is holding something tightly in his right hand.</t7561> <t7562>It is a tuft of yellow hair.</t7562> <t7563>He giggles softly.</t7563>
<t7564>“Janine,” I say.</t7564> <t7565>However, she has let herself go, now entirely, in free fall, retreating into her shell.</t7565>
<t7566>“I wish you a good day,” he says and walks past us, towards the door.</t7566>
<t7567>Then I look back.</t7567> <t7568>The thing I thought was that it was an easy way out.</t7568> <t7569>Even though it was necessary, I don't even feel sadness for him.</t7569> <t7570>I feel anger.</t7570> <t7571>I'm not proud of myself for this, or for other things.</t7571> <t7572>However, that was the situation at the time.</t7572>
<t7573>My hands smell of hot tar.</t7573> <t7574>I want to go back home, go up to the bathroom, and scrub, scrub, scrub my body with hard soap and pumice stone to remove every trace of this smell from my skin.</t7574> <t7575>This smell makes me sick.</t7575>
<t7576>At the same time, I am hungry.</t7576> <t7577>This is a disgusting thing, but nevertheless, it is true.</t7577> <t7578>Death makes me hungry.</t7578> <t7579>Maybe it's because I am emptied; or it is the body's way of dealing with my survival, continuing to repeat its fundamental prayer: I exist, I exist.</t7579> <t7580>I exist, still.</t7580>
<t7581>I want to get into bed, make love, right now.</t7581>
<t7582>Appetite, the word sticks in my mind.</t7582>
<t7583>I can even sweep away a horse.</t7583>
<t7584>44</t7584>
<t7585>Things have returned to normal.</t7585>
<t7586>How can I call it normal?</t7586> <t7587>Still, compared to this morning, it's normal.</t7587>
<t7588>For lunch, there was a cheese sandwich made with brown bread, a glass of milk, celery, and canned pears.</t7588> <t7589>A student's meal.</t7589> <t7590>I finished eating everything, not quickly, but savoring the taste, a medley of flavors on my tongue.</t7590> <t7591>Now I'm going shopping, the usual task.</t7591> <t7592>I'm even looking forward to it.</t7592> <t7593>There is a certain comfort to be taken from routine.</t7593>
<t7594>I'm exiting through the back door, along the path.</t7594> <t7595>Nick is washing the car, his hat tilted to one side.</t7595> <t7596>He's not looking at me.</t7596> <t7597>These days, we avoid looking at each other.</t7597> <t7598>Surely, we could reveal something, here, in the open, even when there's no one to see.</t7598>
<t7599>I'm waiting for Gleninki at the corner.</t7599> <t7600>He's late.</t7600> <t7601>Finally, I see him coming, in the form of a red and white dress, like a kite, walking with the orderly steps we've all learned to follow.</t7601> <t7602>I see him and at first, I don't notice anything.</t7602> <t7603>Then, as he gets closer, I think there must be something strange about him.</t7603> <t7604>He looks wrong.</t7604> <t7605>Transformed in an indescribable way; not injured, not limping either.</t7605> <t7606>As if he were shriveled.</t7606>
<t7607>Then, when it gets really close, I understand what it is.</t7607> <t7608>This is not Glen's.</t7608> <t7609>It's the same height but thinner, and its face is not pink but straw-colored.</t7609> <t7610>It comes towards me and stops.</t7610>
<t7611>“May God bless the fruit,” he says.</t7611> <t7612>Face-wall, lace-upright.</t7612>
<t7613>“May God clear your way,” I reply.</t7613> <t7614>I try to show surprise.</t7614>
<t7615>“You must be Fredinki,” he says.</t7615> <t7616>Yes, I say, and we start walking.</t7616> <t7617>What will happen now, I wonder.</t7617> <t7618>My head is spinning.</t7618> <t7619>This is not good news, what happened to him, how can I find out without seeming too interested?</t7619> <t7620>We must not form friendships or attachments with each other.</t7620> <t7621>I'm trying to remember how much longer Gleninki needs to stay in his current assignment.</t7621>
<t7622>“God has sent us beautiful weather,” I say.</t7622>
<t7623>“I welcome it with happiness.”</t7623> <t7624>His voice is gentle, flat, non-revealing.</t7624>
<t7625>Without saying anything else, we pass the first checkpoint.</t7625> <t7626>He remains silent, but so do I.</t7626> <t7627>Is he waiting for me to start something, to reveal myself, or is he a believer, someone lost in inner contemplation?</t7627>
<t7628>“Was Gleninki transferred this quickly?” I ask, knowing well that it wasn't so.</t7628> <t7629>I saw him just this morning.</t7629> <t7630>If that were the case, he would have told me.</t7630>
<t7631>“Gleninki is mine,” says the woman.</t7631> <t7632>The expression is flawless.</t7632> <t7633>And undoubtedly she is right, the new one, Gleninki, wherever it is, is no longer Gleninki.</t7633> <t7634>I had never learned its real name.</t7634> <t7635>This is how you get lost, in the sea of names.</t7635> <t7636>It is not easy to find it now.</t7636>
<t7637>We stop by Milk and Honey and All Kinds of Meats, I get chicken, the new Gleninki gets a kilo and a half of hamburger.</t7637> <t7638>The usual lines are there.</t7638> <t7639>I see a few women I know, we nod our heads at each other with the vaguest of movements, thus showing that we recognize each other, that we still exist, at least to someone.</t7639> <t7640>Outside All Kinds of Meats, I say to the new Gleninki, "We should go to the Wall."</t7640> <t7641>I don't know what I'm expecting from this; possibly, a way to gauge her reaction.</t7641> <t7642>I feel the need to find out if she is one of us.</t7642> <t7643>If so, and if I can determine this, maybe she can tell me what really happened to Gleninki.</t7643>
<t7644>"As you wish," he says.</t7644> <t7645>Is this indifference or caution?</t7645>
<t7646>This morning, three women are hanging on the Wall, still in their clothes, with white bags still and still placed over their heads.</t7646> <t7647>Their arms untied, hanging stiffly and neatly at their sides.</t7647> <t7648>The one in blue in the middle, the two in red on either side, although the colors are no longer that bright; they look faded, dull, like dead butterflies or tropical fish drying on the ground.</t7648> <t7649>Their gilding has worn off.</t7649> <t7650>We stand and watch them silently.</t7650>
<t7651>"Let this be a lesson to us," says the new Gleninki at last.</t7651>
<t7652>At first, I say nothing; because I am trying to understand what he means.</t7652> <t7653>For us, he might have wanted to say that this regime's injustice and brutality serve as a lesson.</t7653> <t7654>In that case, yes, it needs to be said.</t7654> <t7655>On the other hand, he might have meant the opposite; that is, we should remember what we were told and not get ourselves into trouble, because if we do, we will be rightfully punished.</t7655> <t7656>If that is what he means, what I need to say is, thank goodness.</t7656> <t7657>His voice is soft and toneless, no clues at all.</t7657>
<t7658>I'm trying my luck.</t7658> <t7659>“Yes,” I say.</t7659>
<t7660>It doesn't respond to this, but I feel a white flicker at the corner of my eye, as if it had quickly looked at me.</t7660>
<t7661>A moment later, we turn around and start walking the long way back; we synchronize our steps accordingly, so we appear united.</t7661>
<t7662>Before going any further, I think I might need to wait.</t7662> <t7663>It's too early to push, to probe.</t7663> <t7664>I should give it a week, two weeks, maybe even more, I should watch him carefully, listen to the tones in his voice, the unguarded words, just like Gleninki listened to me.</t7664> <t7665>Now that Gleninki is gone, I'm on alert again, my laziness has vanished, my body is no longer just for pleasure, it also senses the dangers that might come.</t7665> <t7666>I shouldn't be hasty, I shouldn't take unnecessary risks.</t7666> <t7667>However, I need to know.</t7667> <t7668>I hold myself back until I pass the last checkpoint, and with only a few blocks left to go, that's when I can no longer control myself.</t7668>
<t7669>"I didn't know Gleninki very well," I say.</t7669> <t7670>"I mean the one before you.</t7670><t7671>"</t7671>
<t7672>“Yes?” he says.</t7672> <t7673>The fact that he has said something, no matter how cautiously, encourages me.</t7673>
<t7674>“I’ve only known him since May,” I say.</t7674> <t7675>I can feel my skin tightening and my heart racing.</t7675> <t7676>This is deceitful.</t7676> <t7677>For one, it's a lie.</t7677> <t7678>Besides, how will I transition to the next crucial point from here?</t7678> <t7679>“I think it was around the first of May.</t7679> <t7680>What they used to call May Day.</t7680><t7681>”</t7681>
<t7682>“Is that what they used to say?” he says, lightly, indifferently, threateningly.</t7682> <t7683>“It's not an expression I remember.</t7683> <t7684>I'm actually surprised you remember it.</t7684> <t7685>You must have made an effort...” He pauses.</t7685> <t7686>“To clear your mind...”</t7686> <t7687>He pauses again.</t7687> <t7688>“Of such reflections.</t7688><t7689>”</t7689>
<t7690>I feel the cold seeping through my skin like water now.</t7690> <t7691>What it does is warn me.</t7691>
<t7692>Not one of us.</t7692> <t7693>But knows.</t7693>
<t7694>I am walking the last blocks in terror.</t7694> <t7695>I did something stupid again.</t7695> <t7696>Even worse.</t7696> <t7697>It hadn't occurred to me before, but now it hits me: if Glen's been caught, he might talk, in front of others, about me too.</t7697> <t7698>He will talk.</t7698> <t7699>He can't do otherwise.</t7699>
<t7700>But I didn't do anything, I say to myself, in the true sense.</t7700> <t7701>All I did was know.</t7701> <t7702>All I did was not inform.</t7702>
<t7703>They know where my child is.</t7703> <t7704>But what if they bring them and threaten to do something, right in front of me?</t7704> <t7705>But what if they do?</t7705> <t7706>I can't bear to think about what they might do.</t7706> <t7707>And what if Luke, if Luke is in their hands?</t7707> <t7708>And what about my mother, Moira, or anyone else, for that matter?</t7708> <t7709>Oh God, don't make me choose.</t7709> <t7710>I couldn't endure it, I know; Moira was right.</t7710> <t7711>I'll say whatever they want, I'll blame everyone.</t7711> <t7712>That's the truth, at the first scream, even the first moan, I'll turn to jelly, I'll confess to any crime, my end will be hanging on a hook on the Wall.</t7712> <t7713>Keep your head down, I used to tell myself, and don't get caught.</t7713> <t7714>It's no use.</t7714>
<t7715>I was talking to myself like this, on the way home.</t7715>
<t7716>In the corner, we turn to each other in a familiar way.</t7716>
<t7717>“God protect us,” says the new, unreliable Gleninki.</t7717>
<t7718>"God bless," I say, trying to appear enthusiastic.</t7718> <t7719>As if acting so pretentiously would work, we had come to this point now.</t7719>
<t7720>Then she does something very strange.</t7720> <t7721>She leans forward, so much that the stiff white visors on our heads almost touch, I can see her pale beige eyes up close, the fine web of lines on her cheeks, she whispers, in one breath, her voice dry like leaves.</t7721> <t7722>“She hanged herself,” she says.</t7722> <t7723>“After the Salvaging Ceremony.</t7723> <t7724>She saw the van that came for her.</t7724> <t7725>This was better.</t7725><t7726>”</t7726>
<t7727>Then, he walks away from me and down the street.</t7727>
<t7728>45</t7728>
<t7729>As if kicked, my breath is taken away, I stand still for a moment.</t7729>
<t7730>So, he is dead, and I am safe now.</t7730> <t7731>He did it before they arrived.</t7731> <t7732>I feel a great sense of relief.</t7732> <t7733>I feel gratitude towards him.</t7733> <t7734>He died so that I could live.</t7734> <t7735>I am postponing mourning.</t7735>
<t7736>Of course, if this woman is not lying.</t7736> <t7737>This possibility always exists.</t7737>
<t7738>I breathe in deeply, then exhale, nourishing myself with oxygen.</t7738> <t7739>The area in front of me darkens, then clears up again.</t7739> <t7740>I can see my path.</t7740>
<t7741>I turn back, holding my hand on it for a moment to gather myself, then I open the door and go inside.</t7741> <t7742>Nick is there, still washing the car, whistling softly.</t7742> <t7743>He seems very far away.</t7743>
<t7744>Oh Great God; I think, I will do everything you want.</t7744> <t7745>You, who have left me now, I will erase myself, if this is truly your wish; I will empty myself, truly, I will be as clean as a ritual chalice.</t7745> <t7746>I will give up on Nick, I will let go of the others, I will stop complaining.</t7746> <t7747>I will accept my fate.</t7747> <t7748>I will sacrifice myself.</t7748> <t7749>I will repent.</t7749> <t7750>I will leave everything.</t7750> <t7751>I will withdraw from everything.</t7751>
<t7752>I know this cannot be true, but it still crosses my mind.</t7752> <t7753>Everything they taught at the Red Center, everything I resisted, is closing in on me.</t7753> <t7754>I don't want to suffer.</t7754> <t7755>I don't want to be a dancer, feet pounding the air, head a faceless rectangle of white cloth.</t7755> <t7756>I don't want to be a puppet hung on the Wall, I don't want to be a wingless angel.</t7756> <t7757>I want to continue living, in whatever form it may be.</t7757> <t7758>I willingly give up my body, for the use of others.</t7758> <t7759>They can do whatever they please with me.</t7759> <t7760>I am a wretch.</t7760>
<t7761>I am feeling their true strength for the first time.</t7761>
<t7762>Heading towards the back door, I pass by the flower beds and the willow tree.</t7762> <t7763>I will go inside, I will be safe.</t7763> <t7764>I will kneel down in my room, gratefully inhaling the stale air until my lungs burst, smelling the furniture polish.</t7764>
<t7765>Serena Joy has stepped out the front door; she is standing on the steps.</t7765> <t7766>She is calling me.</t7766> <t7767>What does she want?</t7767> <t7768>Does she want me to go to the living room and help wind the gray yarn?</t7768> <t7769>I won't be able to keep my hands steady, she will notice something.</t7769> <t7770>Still, I walk towards her, as I have no other choice.</t7770>
<t7771>On the upper step, he looks far superior to me.</t7771> <t7772>His eyes are blazing, a core blue against the shriveled white of his skin.</t7772> <t7773>I avert my gaze from his face, directing it to the ground; to his feet, to the tip of his cane.</t7773>
<t7774>“I trusted you,” he says.</t7774> <t7775>“I tried to help you.</t7775><t7776>”</t7776>
<t7777>I still don't lift my head to look at him.</t7777> <t7778>A feeling of guilt spreads through my body, I was caught, but for what?</t7778> <t7779>For which of my countless sins was I being accused?</t7779> <t7780>The only way to understand is to remain silent.</t7780> <t7781>Now making an excuse, about this or that, would be a foolish mistake.</t7781> <t7782>I could let slip something he hadn't even thought of.</t7782>
<t7783>Nothing might have happened either.</t7783> <t7784>Maybe it was the match hidden in my bed.</t7784> <t7785>I hold my head down in shame.</t7785>
<t7786>“Huh?” he asks.</t7786> <t7787>“Aren't you going to say something for yourself?</t7787><t7788>”</t7788>
<t7789>I lift my head and look at him.</t7789> <t7790>“About what?” I manage to stammer.</t7790> <t7791>As soon as it leaves my mouth, it sounds insolent-</t7791>
<t7792>“Look,” he says.</t7792> <t7793>He pulls his free hand from behind his back and shows it.</t7793> <t7794>In his hand is the winter cloak he was holding.</t7794> <t7795>“There was a lipstick stain on it,” he says.</t7795> <t7796>“How could you be so rude?</t7796> <t7797>I told her too...”</t7797> <t7798>He drops the cloak, now there's something else in his hand, a hand made entirely of bone.</t7798> <t7799>He throws this to the ground as well, a purple sequin dress falls, sliding down the stairs like snake skin, sparkling in the sunlight.</t7799> <t7800>“And behind my back,” he says.</t7800> <t7801>“You could have left something for me too.”</t7801> <t7802>Despite everything, does he love her?</t7802> <t7803>He raises his cane.</t7803> <t7804>I think he’s going to hit me, but he doesn’t.</t7804> <t7805>“Take that disgusting thing and go to your room.</t7805> <t7806>You’re just like the other one.</t7806> <t7807>A slut.</t7807> <t7808>Your end will be the same too.</t7808><t7809>”</t7809>
<t7810>I bend down and pick up.</t7810> <t7811>Behind me, Nick has stopped whistling.</t7811>
<t7812>I want to turn back, run towards him, and wrap my arms around his neck.</t7812> <t7813>That would be foolish.</t7813> <t7814>There is nothing he can do to help.</t7814> <t7815>He would also be dragged into the mire.</t7815>
<t7816>I walk towards the back door, enter the kitchen and leave my basket, then go upstairs.</t7816> <t7817>I am obedient and calm.</t7817>
<t7818>Fifteen</t7818>
<t7819>Night</t7819>
<t7820>46</t7820>
<t7821>I am sitting in my room, by the window, waiting.</t7821> <t7822>In my lap, a handful of bruised stars.</t7822>
<t7823>This could have been the last time I had to wait.</t7823> <t7824>But I don't know what I'm waiting for.</t7824> <t7825>What are you waiting for? they used to say.</t7825> <t7826>It meant hurry up.</t7826> <t7827>So, no answer was expected.</t7827> <t7828>What are you waiting for, is a different question, and I have no answer to give to this question.</t7828>
<t7829>Still, it's not exactly waiting.</t7829> <t7830>It's more like being in a state of suspension.</t7830> <t7831>Without any hesitation.</t7831> <t7832>There is no time in the end.</t7832>
<t7833>I am in an embarrassing situation, which is the opposite of being virtuous.</t7833> <t7834>I should feel worse about this.</t7834>
<t7835>Yet I feel peaceful, calm, filled with indifference.</t7835> <t7836>Don't let those bastards tear you apart.</t7836> <t7837>I keep repeating this to myself, but it holds no meaning.</t7837> <t7838>Well, it could also mean Don't let it breathe or Exist.</t7838>
<t7839>I think this could be said.</t7839>
<t7840>There is no one in the garden.</t7840>
<t7841>I wonder if it will rain.</t7841>
<t7842>Outside, the weather is getting dark.</t7842> <t7843>It's already turning red.</t7843> <t7844>Soon it will be dark.</t7844> <t7845>It's already darker now.</t7845> <t7846>This didn't take long.</t7846>
<t7847>There were actually a few things I could do.</t7847> <t7848>For example, I could set the house on fire.</t7848> <t7849>I could bundle up some of my clothes and sheets and strike my only hidden match.</t7849> <t7850>If it didn't burn, it wouldn't burn.</t7850> <t7851>On the other hand, if it did burn, at least there would be an event, a kind of sign marking my exit.</t7851> <t7852>A few flames that could be easily extinguished.</t7852> <t7853>Meanwhile, releasing clouds of smoke into the air, I could die from suffocation.</t7853>
<t7854>I could cut the bed sheet into strips, twist them into a makeshift rope, tie one end to the foot of my bed, and try to break the window.</t7854> <t7855>That unbreakable window.</t7855>
<t7856>I could go to the Commander, as they used to say, with my hair disheveled, kneel on the ground, wrap my arms around his knees, confess, lament, and beg for my forgiveness.</t7856> <t7857>I could say, "Nolite te bastardes carborundorum."</t7857> <t7858>Not a prayer.</t7858> <t7859>I bring his shoes to my mind, black, well-polished, unattainable, revealing nothing.</t7859>
<t7860>Instead, I could wrap the bed sheet around my neck, tie myself to the hook in the bathroom, and lean forward to strangle myself.</t7860>
<t7861>I could have hidden behind the door and waited until Serena arrived, limping down the corridor, bringing with her the judgment, whether it was the atonement for my sin or the punishment, whatever it was, I could have pounced on her, knocked her to the ground, and hit her on the head, sharply and perfectly.</t7861> <t7862>To save her from her misery, and of course, from mine as well.</t7862> <t7863>To save her from our misery.</t7863>
<t7864>This would save time.</t7864>
<t7865>I could walk down the stairs with steady steps, exit through the door, and walk along the street, trying to look like I knew where I was going and seeing how far I could go.</t7865> <t7866>Red is a very conspicuous color.</t7866>
<t7867>I could go to Nick's room, the one above the garage, like we did before.</t7867> <t7868>I could satisfy my curiosity about whether he would let me in, whether he would protect me.</t7868> <t7869>Now that this need is real.</t7869>
<t7870>I am reviewing all of this lazily.</t7870> <t7871>Each one looks the same as the others.</t7871> <t7872>None is preferable to the other.</t7872> <t7873>Exhaustion descends upon me, my body, my legs, and my eyes.</t7873> <t7874>In the end, this is what takes hold of you.</t7874> <t7875>Faith is just a word, a fancy word.</t7875>
<t7876>I am looking outside at twilight and thinking that the season is winter.</t7876> <t7877>The falling snow, gently, effortlessly, covering everything with soft crystals, a moonlight haze before the rain, blurring the outlines, erasing the color.</t7877> <t7878>They say freezing to death doesn't hurt, after the initial chill.</t7878> <t7879>You lie down like an angel made by children and drift off to sleep in the snow.</t7879>
<t7880>I feel her presence behind me, my ancestral woman, my twin, spinning in the air under the chandelier, with her costume made of gilding and feathers, a bird halted in flight, a woman turned into an angel, waiting to be found.</t7880> <t7881>This time by me.</t7881> <t7882>How could I have believed I was alone here?</t7882> <t7883>We were always both here.</t7883> <t7884>Finish this job, she says.</t7884> <t7885>I'm tired of this melodrama, tired of staying silent.</t7885> <t7886>There's no one you can protect, your life has no value for anyone.</t7886> <t7887>I want this to end.</t7887>
<t7888>As I stand up, I hear the black minibus arriving.</t7888> <t7889>Before I see it, I hear its sound; adorned with twilight, it seems like the embodiment of its own sound, the coagulation of the night.</t7889> <t7890>The car turns onto the driveway and stops.</t7890> <t7891>I can only see its white eye, those two wings.</t7891> <t7892>Its paint must be phosphorescent.</t7892> <t7893>Two men emerge from the shape of the vehicle, climb the front steps, and ring the bell.</t7893> <t7894>I hear the sound of the bell, ding-dong, like the ghost of a woman selling cosmetics, down in the hall.</t7894>
<t7895>It means worse is coming.</t7895>
<t7896>I was wasting my time.</t7896> <t7897>I should take control of the course of events while I still have a chance.</t7897> <t7898>I should steal a knife from the kitchen, find a way to reach the sewing scissors.</t7898> <t7899>There were garden shears, knitting needles; if you look for them, the world is full of weapons.</t7899> <t7900>I should be careful.</t7900>
<t7901>But it is too late to think about this now, his feet are already on the dusty-rose-colored carpet of the stairs; a heavy, silent walk, a throbbing vein on the forehead.</t7901> <t7902>My back is turned to the window.</t7902>
<t7903>I am expecting a stranger, but it is Nick who pushes the door open and flicks on the light.</t7903> <t7904>I can't find a place for this in my mind, unless he is one of them, of course.</t7904> <t7905>This possibility always existed.</t7905> <t7906>Nick, the special Eye.</t7906> <t7907>Dirty work is done by dirty people.</t7907>
<t7908>You piece of shit, I think.</t7908> <t7909>I open my mouth to say it, but he comes towards me, close, and whispers.</t7909> <t7910>“Everything is fine.</t7910> <t7911>This is Mayday.</t7911> <t7912>Go with them.” He calls me by my real name.</t7912> <t7913>Why should this have any meaning?</t7913>
<t7914>“With them?” I say.</t7914> <t7915>I see the two men standing behind him, the corridor's ceiling light turning their heads into skulls.</t7915> <t7916>“You must be crazy.”</t7916> <t7917>My doubt hovers above him, like a mysterious angel warning me.</t7917> <t7918>I can almost see it.</t7918> <t7919>Why would the Mayday talk never end?</t7919> <t7920>All the Eyes must know this; they must have extracted it by squeezing, crushing, twisting it out of enough bodies, enough mouths by now.</t7920>
<t7921>"Trust me," he says; this phrase has never had a charm of its own, there's never any guarantee.</t7921>
<t7922>Still, I cling tightly to this, to this suggestion.</t7922> <t7923>This is the only thing left to me.</t7923>
<t7924>One in front, one behind, they are accompanying me down the stairs.</t7924> <t7925>The steps are calm, the lights are on.</t7925> <t7926>Despite the fear, how ordinary it is.</t7926> <t7927>I can see the clock from here.</t7927> <t7928>It's not a special time.</t7928>
<t7929>Nick is no longer with us.</t7929> <t7930>He might have gone down the back stairs to avoid being seen.</t7930>
<t7931>Serena Joy is standing in the hallway, under the mirror, looking up, suspicious.</t7931> <t7932>The Commander is behind her, the living room door open.</t7932> <t7933>Her hair is very gray.</t7933> <t7934>She looks anxious and desperate, at the same time avoiding me, keeping her distance.</t7934> <t7935>Whatever else I am to her, at this point I am also a plague.</t7935> <t7936>There is no doubt they had a fight about me; no doubt Serena gave him hell.</t7936> <t7937>I still carry enough emotion inside me to feel sorry for him.</t7937> <t7938>Moira was right, I'm a soft-hearted person.</t7938>
<t7939>“What has she done?” asks Serena Joy.</t7939> <t7940>So, it wasn't her who called them.</t7940> <t7941>Whatever she has planned for me, it's something more special.</t7941>
<t7942>“We can't say, sir,” says the one in front of me.</t7942> <t7943>“I'm sorry.</t7943><t7944>”</t7944>
<t7945>"I need to see your authorization document," says the Commander.</t7945> <t7946>"Do you have an arrest warrant?</t7946><t7947>"</t7947>
<t7948>I could grab the railing and scream without any regard for politeness now.</t7948> <t7949>I could stop them, at least for a while.</t7949> <t7950>If they are real, they will stay; if not, they will run away.</t7950> <t7951>Leaving me here.</t7951>
<t7952>“We don't need it, sir, but everything is in accordance with the orders,” says the first one again.</t7952> <t7953>“Betrayal of national secrets.</t7953><t7954>”</t7954>
<t7955>The Commander puts his hand on his head.</t7955> <t7956>What was I explaining and to whom, moreover, which of his enemies revealed this?</t7956> <t7957>Now the Commander will pose a potential security risk.</t7957> <t7958>I'm above him, looking down from there; he shrinks and diminishes.</t7958> <t7959>There had been a purge among the Commanders before, and there will be more in the future.</t7959> <t7960>Serena Joy turns completely pale.</t7960>
<t7961>"Whore," he says.</t7961> <t7962>"After all the things he did for you."</t7962><t7963>”</t7963>
<t7964>Cora and Rita come out of the kitchen shoving each other.</t7964> <t7965>Cora has started crying.</t7965> <t7966>I was her hope, I let her down.</t7966> <t7967>From now on, she will always be childless.</t7967>
<t7968>The minibus is waiting on the driveway, its double doors open.</t7968> <t7969>Now the two of them, each on one side of me, are helping me get inside by holding my elbows.</t7969> <t7970>There is no way to know if this is my end or a new beginning: I have surrendered myself to strangers because there is no other way.</t7970>
<t7971>And so I climb, into the darkness inside; or into the light.</t7971>
<t7972>Historical Notes</t7972>
<t7973>Historical Notes on The Handmaid's Tale</t7973>
<t7974>On June 25, 2195, at Denay University, Nunavit, a partial transcript of the 12th Symposium on Gilead Studies, which is part of the International Historical Board Congress, was held.</t7974> <t7975>This is a partial copy of the symposium's records.</t7975>
<t7976>President: Professor Maryann Crescent Moon, Department of Caucasus22 Anthropology, Denay University, Nunavit.</t7976>
<t7977>Keynote Speaker: Professor James Darcy Pieixoto, Director of Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Archives, Cambridge University, England.</t7977>
<t7978>CRESCENTMOON: I am pleased to welcome you all here this morning.</t7978> <t7979>Furthermore, I am delighted to see that many of you have gathered for what I am sure will be an interesting and valuable talk by Professor Pieixoto.</t7979> <t7980>As the Gilead Studies Association, we believe that this period, especially in this hemisphere, will ultimately be responsible for redrawing the map of the world, and that further studies will be rewarding.</t7980>
<t7981>I need to make a few announcements before we proceed further.</t7981> <t7982>The fishing trip will take place tomorrow as planned; therefore, for those of you who haven't brought rain-appropriate clothing and insect repellent, it is possible to obtain these at the Registration Desk for a small fee.</t7982> <t7983>The Nature Hike and Outdoor Historical Costume Singing activities have been rescheduled for the day after tomorrow, as our infallible Professor Johnny Running Dog has guaranteed good weather during this period.</t7983>
<t7984>At this congress, as part of the Twelfth Symposium, allow me to remind you of other activities supported and offered by the Gilead Research Association.</t7984> <t7985>Tomorrow afternoon, Professor Gopal Chatterjee from the Department of Western Philosophy at Baroda University in India will speak on "Krishna and Kali Elements in Early Gilead State Religion."</t7985> <t7986>Additionally, on Thursday morning, there will be a presentation by Professor Sieglinda Van Buren from the Department of Military History at the University of San Antonio, Republic of Texas.</t7986> <t7987>Professor Van Buren will give a lecture, which I am sure will be fascinating, on "Warsaw Tactics: Siege Policies in City Centers during the Gilead Civil War."</t7987> <t7988>Undoubtedly, we will all desire to attend these.</t7988>
<t7989>On the other hand, I must remind our keynote speaker -although, I am sure this is not necessary- not to exceed the allotted time, so that we can allocate time for questions, and I believe none of us want to miss lunch like we did yesterday.</t7989> <t7990>(Laughter)</t7990>
<t7991>Since Professor Pieixoto is very well known to all of us through his numerous publications, if not personally, there is little need for further introduction.</t7991> <t7992>These publications include "Laws Aimed at Preventing the Supply of Money Through the Ages: An Analysis of Documents" and his well-known work "Irene and Gilead: Two Late Twentieth Century Monotheocracies as Seen Through Diaries."</t7992> <t7993>As you all know, he is the co-publisher, along with Professor Knotly Wade from Cambridge, of the tape recordings being examined today, and thus has played a role in their transcription, interpretation, and publication.</t7993> <t7994>The title of his speech is "Problems of Authentication and Authorship in Relation to The Handmaid's Tale."</t7994>
<t7995>Professor Pieixoto.</t7995>
<t7996>Applause.</t7996>
<t7997>PIEIXOTO: Thank you.</t7997> <t7998>I am sure we all enjoyed our lovely Arctic Char23 at last night's dinner, and now we are enjoying an equally lovely Arctic Chair24."</t7998> <t7999>I am using the expression "enjoy" in two different senses, of course excluding the outdated third one.</t7999> <t8000>(Laughter.</t8000><t8001>)</t8001>
<t8002>Now, with your permission, let me get a bit serious.</t8002> <t8003>As the title of my little chat suggests, I would like to address some issues related to the soi-disant tape recordings, now very well known to all of you under the title "The Handmaid's Tale."</t8003> <t8004>I say soi-disant because what we have before us is not the material in its original form.</t8004> <t8005>To be more specific, when it was discovered, it did not have the characteristics of an orderly recording and did not have a title either.</t8005> <t8006>The title "The Handmaid's Tale" was given by Professor Wade, partly out of respect for the great Geoffrey Chaucer; however, those who know Professor Wade as closely as I do will understand what I mean when I say that I am certain all wordplays are done with a specific purpose.</t8006> <t8007>Especially when it comes to the wordplay involving the archaic and coarse meaning of the word "tail"; to some extent, it seems to be the very cause of the discord in the Gilead society of our story's period.</t8007> <t8008>(Laughter, applause.</t8008><t8009>)</t8009>
<t8010>This piece - I hesitate to use the word document - was unearthed in what was once the city of Bangor, in the area formerly known as the State of Maine before the onset of the Gilead regime.</t8010> <t8011>We know this city as an important way station on what our author has designated the "Underground Femaleroad," which is why our more facetious historians later dubbed it the "Underground Frailroad."</t8011> <t8012>(Laughter, murmurs.</t8012><t8013>)</t8013> <t8014>This is why our Union has taken a special interest in it.</t8014>
<t8015>In its original form, this piece is a U.</t8015> <t8016>S. army item, possibly from around (circa) 1955, consisting of a metal box.</t8016> <t8017>This fact may not be very significant in itself, as it is known that such small boxes are often sold as “army surplus,” and therefore should be easily found.</t8017> <t8018>Inside this box, there were about thirty tape cassettes, sealed with a type of tape once used for packages sent by mail; these cassettes had become outdated somewhere in the eighties or nineties with the advent of compact discs.</t8018>
<t8019>I would like to remind you that this is not the first of such findings.</t8019> <t8020>For example, you are undoubtedly familiar with the piece known as "A.</t8020> <t8021>B.</t8021> <t8022>Memories," discovered in a garage in one of Seattle's existences, and "P.'s Diary," accidentally unearthed during the construction of a new meeting house in the area once known as Syracuse, that is, New York.</t8022>
<t8023>Professor Wade and I were filled with great excitement when we encountered this new finding.</t8023> <t8024>Fortunately, a few years ago, with the help of our excellent assistant technician who is an antique enthusiast, we had managed to recreate a machine that could play such tapes, and we immediately set to the arduous task of copying.</t8024>
<t8025>In our collection, we had about thirty tapes that, despite the conversations, also contained varying amounts of music.</t8025> <t8026>Each tape, undoubtedly for camouflage purposes, usually starts with two or three songs: then the music suddenly stops and the conversation begins.</t8026> <t8027>The voice belongs to a woman, and according to our sound-recording experts, it is always the same voice speaking.</t8027> <t8028>The labels on the tapes were the actual labels from that period, of course, dating back to a time before the early Gilead era, because such worldly music was banned under that regime.</t8028> <t8029>For example, there were four tapes under the title "The Golden Years of Elvis Presley," three titled "Lithuanian Folk Songs," another three titled "Boy George Lifts It Up," and two titled "Mantovani's Soft Strings."</t8029> <t8030>Additionally, there were titles found on a single tape: "Twisted Sister at Carnegie Hall" was one of my personal favorites.</t8030>
<t8031>Although the labels were real, they did not always correspond to the tapes containing the relevant songs.</t8031> <t8032>Additionally, the tapes were not arranged in any particular order; they were just lying at the bottom of the box: they weren't even numbered.</t8032> <t8033>Thus, it was up to Professor Wade and me to arrange these blocks of speech in the order they seemed to go; still, as I mentioned elsewhere, such arrangements are somewhat speculative, so they should be seen as approximate and subject to more detailed investigation.</t8033>
<t8034>As soon as we got hold of the records -due to difficulties stemming from the accent, ambiguous references, and some outdated expressions, we had to examine them multiple times- we had to make some decisions about the nature of this material, which cost us so much effort to obtain.</t8034> <t8035>We were left with a few possibilities.</t8035> <t8036>First of all, the tape recordings could be fake.</t8036> <t8037>As you know, undoubtedly many such forgeries have occurred, where publishers paid large sums of money, driven by the sensationalism of these kinds of stories.</t8037> <t8038>Apparently, certain periods in history not only provide material for moral tales at a glance, both for other societies and for those who follow them, but also serve as a pretext for a great deal of hypocritical self-congratulation.</t8038> <t8039>If I may open a parenthesis here, allow me to say that we should be careful when making moral judgments about the Gileadeans.</t8039> <t8040>Undoubtedly, we have learned by now that such judgments are necessarily culture-specific.</t8040> <t8041>On the other hand, the Gilead society was under the immense pressure of demographic and a number of other issues, and was influenced by factors from which we are more independent today.</t8041> <t8042>Our job is not to censor but to understand.</t8042> <t8043>(Applause.</t8043><t8044>)</t8044>
<t8045>Let's return to our topic: it is, somehow, very difficult to convincingly imitate such recordings; moreover, experts who examined them assured us of the authenticity of these physical objects.</t8045> <t8046>Undoubtedly, the recording itself, that is, the recording of sound onto the music cassette, could not have been made in the last one hundred and fifty years.</t8046>
<t8047>Assuming the tapes are real, what about the nature of the content?</t8047> <t8048>Obviously, if the author is telling the truth, since no machine or tape recorder was provided for his use, and moreover, he had no place to store them, it could not have been recorded during the time period he narrates.</t8048> <t8049>On the other hand, there is a certain intellectual quality in the story that leads me to exclude simultaneity.</t8049> <t8050>It possesses a hint of emotions recalled, if not in a moment of tranquility, then at least post facto.</t8050>
<t8051>If we could attribute an identity to the storyteller, we felt that we could make significant progress in explaining how this document - allow me to call it that for the sake of brevity - was created.</t8051> <t8052>To achieve this, we followed two paths in our investigation.</t8052>
<t8053>First, by examining Bangor's old city plans and other remaining documents, we set out to identify the residents of this house who lived at the discovery site around this time.</t8053> <t8054>We reasoned that this house might have been one of the "safe houses" on the Underground Women's Road during the period in question, and that our author might have hidden in the attic or basement for a few weeks or months, during which time they had the opportunity to make recordings.</t8054> <t8055>Of course, there was no reason to dismiss the possibility that the tapes could have been brought to the location after the recordings were made.</t8055> <t8056>We hoped to trace the descendants of these presumed local residents and locate them, believing that these individuals might lead us to other materials: perhaps diaries or family records passed down through generations.</t8056>
<t8057>Unfortunately, this road led nowhere.</t8057> <t8058>If these people were truly a link in the underground chain, they had likely been discovered and arrested; in that case, all documents related to them would have been destroyed.</t8058> <t8059>Thus, we followed a second attempt.</t8059> <t8060>We scoured the records of the period, trying to connect the historical figures known to us with those appearing in our author's story.</t8060> <t8061>Due to the Gilead regime's habit of purging its ranks and cleaning its computers and records after various purges and internal rebellions, the records from that time are irregular, yet some documents still exist.</t8061> <t8062>In fact, some of them were secretly smuggled to England to be used for propaganda purposes by Women-Rescue organizations, many of which were present in the British Isles at that time.</t8062>
<t8063>We never hoped to directly identify the storyteller.</t8063> <t8064>According to what we have deduced from the available material, it is clear that she was part of the first wave of women gathered for the purpose of childbirth and was allocated to those who both required such services and could claim rights over them due to their positions within the elite class.</t8064> <t8065>The regime, by declaring all second marriages and all non-marital relationships as adultery and through a simple tactic based on the arrest of female spouses, instantly created such a group of women.</t8065> <t8066>Furthermore, on the grounds of moral impropriety, they confiscated the children of these women and placed them with higher-ranking childless families who were desperate to have children by any means.</t8066> <t8067>(In the mid-period, this practice was expanded to include all marriages not sanctioned by the state church.</t8067><t8068>)</t8068> <t8069>Thus, men occupying high positions in the regime could choose and take women who had proven their suitability for this purpose by giving birth to one or two healthy children.</t8069> <t8070>Healthy births previously made were a desirable trait in that era, marked by rapidly declining birth rates, a phenomenon seen not only in Gilead but also in most North Caucasian societies of that time.</t8070>
<t8071>The reasons for this decline are not entirely clear to us.</t8071> <t8072>This failure in fertility can, of course, be partly attributed to the widespread use of various forms of birth control, including abortion, in the period immediately preceding Gilead.</t8072> <t8073>In this case, some infertility was intentional, which could explain the differing statistics between Caucasians and non-Caucasians; nevertheless, there were also unintended cases of infertility.</t8073> <t8074>Do I need to remind you that this was the era of hereditary syphilis and the infamous AIDS epidemic?</t8074> <t8075>When the latter spread widely through society, it pushed many young and sexually active people out of the reproductive group.</t8075> <t8076>Stillbirths, miscarriages, and genetic disorders were common and increasing.</t8076> <t8077>Moreover, this trend was linked to various nuclear facility accidents, work stoppages in factories, and the sabotage events that defined the period.</t8077> <t8078>There were also leaks from chemical and biological warfare reserve depots, whether legal or not, and from sites where toxic wastes were stored—sometimes these substances were simply released into the sewer system. The uncontrolled use of chemicals and other sprays that killed harmful insects and plants was also an issue.</t8078>
<t8079>However, whatever the reasons, the effects were noticeably apparent, and it wasn't just the Gilead regime that reacted to this situation at the time.</t8079> <t8080>For instance, Romania had preceded Gilead in the eighties by banning all forms of birth control, subjecting the female population to mandatory pregnancy tests, and linking salary increases to the number of children brought into the world.</t8080>
<t8081>The need for what I would call birth services was an event recognized even in the pre-Gilead era: this need was inadequately attempted to be met through the use of "artificial insemination," "fertility clinics," and "surrogate mothers" hired for this purpose.</t8081> <t8082>Gilead banned the first two on the grounds that they were against religion, while legalizing and making mandatory the third, which was thought to have permissive precedents in sacred texts.</t8082> <t8083>Thus, they transformed the serial polygamy that was common in the pre-Gilead era into its simultaneous form, practiced both in Old Testament times and in the old State of Utah in the nineteenth century.</t8083> <t8084>As we know from historical studies, no new system can impose itself without somehow employing many elements found in the old one: just as we witness the presence of pagan elements in Medieval Christianity and the evolution of the Russian "KGB" organization from the Tsar's secret service that preceded it.</t8084> <t8085>Undoubtedly, Gilead was no exception in this regard.</t8085> <t8086>For example, its racist policies were tightly linked to the pre-Gilead era; it is these racist fears that provided the emotional fuel that allowed the Gilead regime to go as far as it did.</t8086>
<t8087>In this case, our storyteller was one of many and should be seen within the narrow framework of that moment in history of which she was a part.</t8087> <t8088>But what do we know about her besides her age, physical characteristics that could belong to anyone, and the place she resided?</t8088> <t8089>Not much.</t8089> <t8090>Apparently, she was an educated woman, if anyone educated at any North American college of that time could be called educated, of course.</t8090> <t8091>(Laughter, some grumbling.</t8091><t8092>)</t8092> <t8093>However, as you said, the forests were full of them, so it’s of no use.</t8093> <t8094>She does not deem us worthy of knowing her real name; in fact, all official records of this name must have been destroyed upon her entry into the Rachel and Leah Re-Education Center.</t8094> <t8095>“Ofglen” and “Ofwarren,” like “Offred,” give no clues, as they are names derived from the first name of the man in question and a possessive suffix.</t8095> <t8096>These kinds of names were automatically taken by women when they became part of a particular Commander's household and were automatically relinquished when they left.</t8096>
<t8097>The other names in the document are equally useless for identifying and verifying the authenticity of both the record and the author.</t8097> <t8098>Names like "Moira" and "Janine," as well as "Luke" and "Nick," remain ambiguous.</t8098> <t8099>There is a strong possibility that these are pseudonyms adapted to protect these individuals in case the tapes were discovered.</t8099> <t8100>If this is the case, it would confirm our view that the recordings were made within the borders of Gilead, not outside, to be secretly taken back by the Mayday underground organization for later use.</t8100>
<t8101>The elimination of the above possibilities left us with only one.</t8101> <t8102>We felt that if we could determine the identity of the fugitive "Commander," at least some progress would be made.</t8102> <t8103>We assumed that someone in such a high position might have been a possible member of the original Brain Trust of the Sons of Jacob, a highly secretive council where Gilead's philosophy and social structure were shaped.</t8103> <t8104>These councils were formed shortly after the superpowers recognized mutual non-aggression and signed the secret Sphere of Influence Agreement.</t8104> <t8105>This agreement allowed the superpowers to freely deal with the increasing number of uprisings within their own empires without interference from the other.</t8105> <t8106>The official records of the Sons of Jacob meetings were destroyed after the Mid-Period Great Purge, which discredited and eliminated some of Gilead's true architects.</t8106> <t8107>Nevertheless, we have some information thanks to the encrypted diary kept by Wilfred Limpkin, one of the sociobiologists present there.</t8107> <t8108>(As we know, just as Darwinism was used by earlier ideologies, the sociobiological theory of natural polygamy was used as scientific evidence for some of the more peculiar practices of this regime.</t8108><t8109>)</t8109>
<t8110>We know from the material obtained from Limpkin that there are two possible candidates; that is, two people with the name element "Fred": Frederick R.</t8110> <t8111>Waterford and B.</t8111> <t8112>Frederick Judd.</t8112> <t8113>Neither of their photos has survived to this day, although Limpkin describes the latter as a conceited fool, let me quote: “Someone for whom what you do on a golf course is foreplay.” (Laughter.) Limpkin himself did not live long after the founding of Gilead; the only reason we have his diary is that he foresaw his end and sent it to his sister-in-law in Calgary.</t8113>
<t8114>Waterford and Judd both have characteristics that make them interesting to us.</t8114> <t8115>Waterford had expertise in market research and, according to Limpkin, was responsible for the design of women's clothing and the suggestion that the Handmaids wear red; apparently, he borrowed this red idea from the uniforms of German prisoners in "POW" camps in Canada during World War II.</t8115> <t8116>He also seems to be the creator of the term "Particicution," which he borrowed from an exercise program that was popular at some point in the last third of the century; however, the ritual of mass hanging was derived from a seventeenth-century English village tradition.</t8116> <t8117>"Salvaging" might also belong to him, but by the time Gilead was established, this practice, originating in the Philippines, had gained popularity as a general term used to mean the elimination of a political enemy.</t8117> <t8118>As I have said elsewhere, there was very little that was truly unique to or originated from Gilead: its genius lay in its power of synthesis.</t8118>
<t8119>On the other hand, Judd seems to be more about developing tactics than packaging.</t8119> <t8120>He is the one who suggested using a little-known “CIA” pamphlet on destabilizing foreign governments as a strategic handbook for the Sons of Jacob; besides that, he also prepared the death list of the leading “Americans” of the time.</t8120> <t8121>Additionally, he is suspected of organizing the President's Day Massacre: it must have required extreme infiltration into the security system surrounding Congress for its execution; moreover, without this massacre, the suspension of the Constitution could not have occurred.</t8121> <t8122>The idea of privatizing the plan to load Jews onto ships and return them to their homeland was also his.</t8122> <t8123>The result was that more than one shipload of Jews were simply dumped into the Atlantic to increase profit.</t8123> <t8124>Considering what we know about Judd, this event must not have shaken him much.</t8124> <t8125>He was a man of fixed ideas, and Limpkin testifies to him having said: “Our great mistake was teaching them to read.</t8125> <t8126>We won't do that again.</t8126><t8127>”</t8127>
<t8128>Convince that the one who designed the form of the Particicution ceremony, which not only serves as a purely frightening and effective way for a person to keep themselves away from deviant elements but also acts as a safety valve for the female elements in Gilead, is Judd.</t8128> <t8129>Scapegoats have been useful throughout history with their bad reputations; for these Handmaids, who are otherwise very strictly controlled, the opportunity to occasionally tear apart a man with their bare hands must have been a great blessing.</t8129> <t8130>This practice became so popular and effective that it was regularized in the mid-term, being performed four times a year during solstices and equinoxes.</t8130> <t8131>There are reflections here of the fertility rites performed for the Earth Goddesses of ancient times.</t8131> <t8132>As we heard in yesterday afternoon's panel discussion, although Gilead is structurally undoubtedly patriarchal, it was occasionally matriarchal in content, similar to some sectors in the social fabric that constituted it.</t8132> <t8133>As the architects of Gilead well knew, to establish an effective totalitarian system, or indeed any system, you need to offer certain rights and freedoms in place of what you take away, at least to a privileged minority.</t8133>
<t8134>In this context, perhaps it is time to make a few comments on the formidable female supervision institution known as "Aunt-hood."</t8134> <t8135>From the very beginning, Judd Limpkin believed that the best and most economical way to supervise women for fertility and other purposes was through other women.</t8135> <t8136>There were plenty of historical precedents for this; in fact, no empire that imposed itself by force or otherwise had done so without this feature: the supervision of the local population by members of their own community.</t8136> <t8137>In the case of Gilead, there were many women willing to serve as Aunts either because they genuinely believed in what they called "traditional values" or because of the benefits they could gain from it.</t8137> <t8138>Where power is scarce, even a little bit of it is tempting.</t8138> <t8139>There was also a negative incentive: unmarried and childless, infertile, or elderly women could avoid being deemed unnecessary and eventually sent to the infamous Colonies by taking on roles within the Aunt-hood system.</t8139> <t8140>These colonies essentially consisted of mobile human communities used as expendable toxic cleanup crews; however, if you were lucky enough, you could be assigned to less dangerous tasks like picking cotton and harvesting fruit.</t8140>
<t8141>So, the idea belongs to Judd, but the implementation bears Waterford's mark.</t8141> <t8142>Who else among the Sons of Jacob Brain Trust would have come up with the suggestion that the Aunts should be given the names of commercial products -cosmetic varieties, cake mixes, frozen desserts, even medicinal remedies- that women could access just before the Gilead era, and thus were familiar with and found reassuring?</t8142> <t8143>This was a brilliant move, during the times when Waterford was favored, reinforcing our view that he possessed considerable creativity.</t8143> <t8144>Well, in his own way, Judd was such a person too.</t8144>
<t8145>Both of these gentlemen were childless, and thus were known to be eligible to acquire a series of Handmaids.</t8145> <t8146>In our joint thesis, "The Notion of Seed in Early Gilead," Professor Wade and I posited that both had been exposed to a sterilizing virus developed from covert gene-linkage experiments with mumps patients in the pre-Gilead era; the original intent was to mix this virus into the caviar stock consumed by high-ranking officials in Moscow.</t8146> <t8147>(This experiment was abandoned after the Domain Agreements, as the virus was deemed too uncontrollable and thus dangerous by many; still, some desired to sprinkle the virus over India).</t8147>
<t8148>Anyway, neither Judd nor Waterford was married to a woman named or known as "Pam" or "Serena Joy".</t8148> <t8149>This second one seems to be a malicious fabrication by our author.</t8149> <t8150>Judd's wife's name was Bambi Mae, and Waterford's wife's name was Thelma.</t8150> <t8151>However, the latter had once worked as a television personality of the described type.</t8151> <t8152>We know this from Limpkin, who made a few sarcastic remarks on the subject.</t8152> <t8153>The regime itself also had difficulty concealing such past deviations from the general practice by the wives of its elite members.</t8153>
<t8154>The evidence is entirely in favor of Waterford.</t8154> <t8155>For instance, we know that shortly after the events described by our possible author, during one of the first purges, he met his fate.</t8155> <t8156>He was accused of having liberal tendencies, possessing a considerable amount of unauthorized, unconventional pictorial and literary material, and moreover, harboring a regime dissident.</t8156> <t8157>This was before the regime began holding its trials in secret; they were still broadcast on television. Therefore, the events were recorded via satellite in England and are still available in the video cassette bank of our Archive.</t8157> <t8158>The footage of Waterford is not good, but clear enough to conclude that his hair was indeed gray.</t8158>
<t8159>As for the regime dissident whom Waterford is accused of harboring, her escape could very well place her in this category, making her "OfFred."</t8159> <t8160>In fact, as the very existence of the tapes proves, it is more likely that "Nick" was the one who helped "OfFred" escape.</t8160> <t8161>The manner in which he was able to facilitate this escape identifies him as a member of the Mayday underground organization, which is not identical to but connected with the Underground Femaleroad.</t8161> <t8162>While the first was entirely a rescue operation, the second was a semi-military organization.</t8162> <t8163>It is known that some members of the Mayday organization infiltrated the Gilead power structure at the highest levels, so placing one of their members in the position of Waterford's driver would have been a real coup; and since such drivers and personal servants, as often was the case, had to be members of the Eyes, "Nick" would have been a double coup.</t8163> <t8164>Undoubtedly, Waterford was aware of this, but since all high-ranking Commanders were automatically under the control of the Eyes, he did not give it much importance and did not allow it to interrupt his violation of the rules he considered less significant.</t8164> <t8165>Like most early Gilead Commanders who were later purged, he saw his position as above attack.</t8165> <t8166>The style of mid-period Gilead was more cautious.</t8166>
<t8167>Here is our prediction.</t8167> <t8168>Even if we assume this to be true - that is, even if we assume Waterford is indeed "the Commander" - many gaps remain.</t8168> <t8169>If his natural inclination were different, some of these gaps could have been filled by our anonymous author.</t8169> <t8170>If he had the instincts of a journalist or a spy, he could have told us a lot about the practices of my Gilead empire.</t8170> <t8171>What wouldn't we give now for even a twenty-page transcript of Waterford's personal computer!</t8171> <t8172>Anyway, we must be grateful for every crumb that the Goddess of History has bestowed upon us.</t8172>
<t8173>As for the fate of our storyteller, it remains uncertain.</t8173> <t8174>Was she secretly smuggled from the Gilead border to what was then Canada and from there reached England?</t8174> <t8175>That would have been wise, because Canada did not want to anger its powerful neighbor, and there was talk of gathering and returning such refugees.</t8175> <t8176>If that was the case, why didn't she take the story she recorded with her?</t8176> <t8177>Perhaps her journey was sudden; perhaps she was afraid of being stopped on the way.</t8177> <t8178>On the other hand, she could have been recaptured.</t8178> <t8179>If she really reached England, why didn't she ensure that her story was known to everyone, as many others did when they reached the outside world?</t8179> <t8180>Assuming she was still alive (which was unlikely), she might have been afraid they would take revenge on "Luke, or even her daughter.</t8180> <t8181>After all, the Gilead regime did not refrain from taking such measures.</t8181> <t8182>It was clearly using them to prevent anti-regime broadcasts in foreign countries.</t8182> <t8183>It is known that more than one careless refugee received a hand, ear, or foot hidden and vacuum-sealed in a special package, for example, in a coffee can.</t8183> <t8184>Or after leading a protected life, once she reached the outside world, she might have been one of those rescued Handmaids who had difficulty adapting.</t8184> <t8185>She could have become a recluse like them.</t8185> <t8186>We don't know.</t8186>
<t8187>“We can only infer Nick's motives in arranging her escape.</t8187> <t8188>We can assume that when the connection between the girl's husband Glen and Mayday was discovered, he found himself in danger as well.</t8188> <t8189>Because, as a member of the Eyes, he knew very well that Fred's would also be interrogated.</t8189> <t8190>The penalties for engaging in unauthorized sexual activity with a Handmaid were severe, and moreover, his status as an Eye would not save him.</t8190> <t8191>The society of Gilead was extremely complex, and any violation of the rules could be used by unnamed enemies within the regime.</t8191> <t8192>Undoubtedly, he could have destroyed her himself, perhaps that would have been a wiser course; still, there is such a thing as the human heart, and as we know, both of them thought she might be pregnant by him.</t8192> <t8193>Moreover, in the Gilead era, what man could resist the possibility of fatherhood, which carried so much status and was so generously rewarded?</t8193> <t8194>Instead, he called a rescue team composed of Eyes under his command, whether real or not.</t8194> <t8195>By doing so, he might very well have caused his own downfall.</t8195> <t8196>We will never know this either.</t8196>
<t8197>Did our storyteller reach the outside world safely and establish a new life for herself?</t8197> <t8198>Or was she found in her hiding place in the attic, arrested, and sent to the Colonies or Jezebel's?</t8198> <t8199>Or was she executed?</t8199> <t8200>Our well-crafted document in its own style remains silent on these matters.</t8200> <t8201>We can call Eurydice from the world of the dead, but we cannot force her to answer; moreover, when we turn to look at her, we see her only for a moment before she slips away from our grasp.</t8201> <t8202>As all historians know, the past is a vast darkness filled with echoes.</t8202> <t8203>The voices from it can reach us; however, what they tell us is shrouded in the ambiguity of the womb from which they emerged.</t8203> <t8204>Furthermore, no matter how hard we try, under the brighter light of our own age, we may not always fully decipher their meanings.</t8204>
<t8205>Applause</t8205>
<t8206>Does anyone have any questions?</t8206>
