<t1>When I was younger and more vulnerable, my father gave me a piece of advice that I have not stopped thinking about since then.</t1>
<t2>"Before criticizing anyone," he told me, "remember that not everyone has had the advantages you've had."</t2>
<t3>That was all, but within our reserve, we have always understood each other in an uncommon way, and I understood that his words meant much more.</t3> <t4>Consequently, I tend to reserve my judgments, a habit that has allowed me to discover very curious characters and has also made me the victim of quite a few incorrigible bores.</t4> <t5>The anomalous mind detects and quickly takes advantage of that quality when it perceives it in an ordinary person, and it so happened that at university I was unjustly accused of being an intriguer, for being aware of the secret sorrows of some inaccessible and difficult individuals.</t5> <t6>Most of the confidences I did not seek: many times I have pretended to sleep, or to be absorbed in my own concerns, or I have shown a hostile frivolity at the first unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was looming on the horizon; because the intimate revelations of the young, or at least the terms in which they make them, are generally plagiarized and suffer from obvious omissions.</t6> <t7>Not judging is a reason for infinite hope.</t7> <t8>I still believe that I would lose something if I forgot that, as my father suggested with a certain snobbery, and as I now repeat with a certain snobbery, the most basic sense of decency is unequally distributed at birth.</t8>
<t9>And, after boasting about my tolerance, I find myself forced to admit that it has a limit.</t9> <t10>I don't care, once a certain point is surpassed, whether the behavior is founded on stone or on swampy ground.</t10> <t11>When I returned from the East last autumn, I was aware that I desired a world in military uniform, in a kind of permanent moral vigilance; I no longer wanted wild excursions and privileged glimpses into the human heart.</t11> <t12>The only exception was Gatsby, the man who gives this book its title: Gatsby, who represented everything for which I feel genuine contempt.</t12> <t13>If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something magnificent about Gatsby, an extraordinary sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were connected to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes from fifteen thousand kilometers away.</t13> <t14>Such sensitivity has nothing to do with the soft sentimentality that we dignify with the name of "creative temperament": it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in anyone else and probably never will again.</t14> <t15>No: Gatsby, in the end, turned out all right.</t15> <t16>It was what preyed on him, the foul dust that floated in the wake of his dreams, that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.</t16>
<t17>My family has enjoyed influence and well-being in this Midwestern city for three generations.</t17> <t18>The Carraways are like a clan, and there is a tradition among us that we descend from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the true founder of our family branch was my grandfather's brother, who arrived here in 1851, paid for someone else to take his place in the Civil War, and founded the wholesale hardware business that my father runs today.</t18>
<t19>I never got to know my great-uncle, but they say I resemble him, especially the stern portrait my father has hanging in his office.</t19> <t20>I finished my studies in New Haven[2] in 1915, exactly a quarter of a century after my father, and shortly thereafter I participated in that aborted Teutonic migration known as the Great War.</t20> <t21>I enjoyed the counteroffensive so much that I returned full of unease.</t21> <t22>The Midwest no longer seemed to me the burning center of the world, but the last and miserable edge of the universe, and I decided to go East and learn the secrets of bond trading.</t22> <t23>All my acquaintances were involved in bonds, so I thought the business could support one more.</t23> <t24>My aunts and uncles debated the matter as if they were looking for a school for me, and finally said: "Well, well... yes," very seriously, with an expression of doubt.</t24> <t25>My father agreed to finance me for a year and, after several postponements, I went East in the spring of 1922, forever, or so I thought.</t25>
<t26>The practical thing was to look for accommodation in the city, but it was very hot, and I was coming from a country generous with grass and hospitable trees, so when an office colleague suggested renting a house together in a nearby town, it seemed like a great idea.</t26> <t27>He found the house, a battered cardboard bungalow, for eighty dollars a month, but at the last minute, the company sent him to Washington, and I went to the countryside alone.</t27> <t28>I had a dog, or at least I had one for a few days until it ran away, an old Dodge, and a Finnish lady who made my bed and breakfast, and murmured Finnish proverbs next to the electric stove.</t28>
<t29>I felt lonely for a day, more or less, until one morning someone who had arrived after me stopped me on the road.</t29>
<t30>—How do you get to West Egg? —he asked me, confused.</t30>
<t31>I told him.</t31> <t32>And, when I continued on my way, I no longer felt alone.</t32> <t33>I was a guide, an explorer, one of the first settlers.</t33> <t34>That man had bestowed upon me the honor of being a citizen of the place.</t34>
<t35>And so, with the sunlight and the splendid explosion of leaves growing on the trees like things grow in time-lapse films, I had the well-known certainty that life begins again with the summer.</t35>
<t36>There was so much to read, on the one hand, and so much health to inhale from the new and invigorating air!</t36> <t37>I bought a bunch of books on banking, credit, and the stock market, which, standing on the shelf, bound in red and gold, like money freshly minted, promised to reveal to me the radiant secrets that only Midas, Morgan, and Maecenas knew.</t37> <t38>And I also had the lofty purpose of reading many other books.</t38> <t39>At university, I had felt certain literary inclinations —one year I wrote a series of editorials for the Yale News, full of clichés and solemnity— and now I was going to revive that until I became the most limited of all specialists, "the complete man."</t39> <t40>This is not just an epigram, because, after all, life is best observed from a single window.</t40>
<t41>It was by chance that I rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America.</t41> <t42>It was on that narrow and bustling island that extends east of New York and where, among other natural curiosities, two rare land masses are formed.</t42> <t43>About thirty kilometers from the city, two enormous eggs, identical in profile and separated only by a small bay, stand out in the most domesticated body of saltwater in the Western Hemisphere, the Long Island Sound, a great corral of humidity.</t43> <t44>They are not perfectly oval—like Columbus's egg, both are flattened on the side they rest on—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder for the seagulls that fly over them.</t44> <t45>For creatures without wings, their dissimilarity in every detail other than shape and size is a more interesting phenomenon.</t45>
<t46>I lived in West Egg, the..., well, the less fashionable of the two eggs, though this is the most superficial formula to express the strange, rather sinister contrast between them.</t46> <t47>My house was at the tip of the egg about fifty meters from the strait, squeezed between two imposing mansions that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand dollars a season.</t47> <t48>The one that rose to my right was colossal without question, a faithful copy of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, extraordinarily new under a sparse beard of young ivy, a marble pool, and twenty acres of gardens and lawn.</t48> <t49>It was Gatsby's mansion.</t49> <t50>Or, more precisely, since I did not know Mr. Gatsby, it was the mansion of a gentleman who went by that name.</t50> <t51>My house was a horror, but an insignificant horror, which no one had noticed, so it had views of the sea and part of my neighbor's lawn, as well as the comforting proximity of millionaires, all for eighty dollars a month.</t51>
<t52>On the other side of the small bay, the white palaces of the elegant East Egg glittered in the water, and the story of that summer begins precisely the night I went to dine at Tom Buchanan's house.</t52> <t53>Daisy was a distant cousin of mine, and I knew Tom from university.</t53> <t54>And, just after the war, I spent a couple of days with them in Chicago.</t54>
<t55>Daisy's husband, among other physical achievements, had been one of the most powerful ends to ever play football at New Haven: a national figure, one might say, one of those men who at twenty-one reach such a degree of excellence in a particular type of activity that everything that comes afterward feels like a disappointment.</t55> <t56>His family was excessively wealthy—to the point that in college his liberality with money was a subject of censure—but now they had moved from Chicago to the East, with a lifestyle that took one's breath away; for example, he had brought a stable of polo ponies from Lake Forest.</t56> <t57>It was hard to understand that a member of my generation could be rich enough to afford such a thing.</t57>
<t58>I don't know why they came to the East.</t58> <t59>They had spent a year in France without any specific reason, and then they had gone from place to place, restlessly, wherever polo was played or the rich gathered.</t59> <t60>Now they had moved for good, Daisy told me over the phone, but I didn't believe it: I couldn't see into Daisy's heart, but I knew that Tom would continue to anxiously and eternally seek the dramatic turbulence of some irretrievable football game.</t60>
<t61>And then, on a windy and hot afternoon, I went to East Egg to see two old friends whom I barely knew.</t61> <t62>Their house was even more exquisite than I expected, a cheerful red and white colonial mansion, Georgian style, overlooking the bay.</t62> <t63>The lawn started at the beach and stretched for half a kilometer up to the front door, passing sundials, terracotta paths, and lit gardens, until finally, upon reaching the house, as if taking advantage of the momentum, it climbed the wall transformed into healthy vines.</t63> <t64>The facade was broken by a succession of glass doors, which gleamed with golden reflections and opened wide to the wind and the heat of the afternoon. Tom Buchanan, in riding attire, was standing on the porch, legs apart.</t64>
<t65>He had changed since the days of New Haven.</t65> <t66>Now he was a thirty-year-old man, strong, blond like straw, with a hard set to his mouth and an air of self-sufficiency.</t66> <t67>His eyes, shining with arrogance, dominated his face and gave him the appearance of always being aggressively forward.</t67> <t68>Not even the ostentatious and effeminate elegance of the riding suit could hide the enormous vigor of that body: it seemed to fill those gleaming boots to the point of straining the laces that topped them, and the reaction of the imposing muscle mass was perceptible when the shoulder moved under the light jacket.</t68> <t69>It was a body capable of developing enormous strength: a cruel body.</t69>
<t70>When he spoke, his tenor voice, hoarse and rough, increased the impression of indifference that he conveyed.</t70> <t71>That voice had a hint of paternal disdain, even towards people he liked.</t71> <t72>There were men in New Haven who detested him.</t72>
<t73>"Well, don't go thinking that my opinion is definitive," he seemed to say, "just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you."</t73> <t74>We belonged to the same student association, and although we were never close friends, I always had the impression that he liked me, that he needed my esteem with that sad, hard, and defiant eagerness that was so characteristic of him.</t74>
<t75>We talked for a few minutes on the porch, in the sun.</t75>
<t76>—This place is fine —he said, looking around with restless eyes.</t76>
<t77>He made me turn around, grabbing me by the arm, and pointed with his large, open hand at the panorama that stretched out before us, including in his sweep an Italian garden, two thousand square meters of roses with a penetrating and intense fragrance, and a motorboat, flat at the bow, which the tide was rocking a short distance from the shore.</t77>
<t78>—It was Demaine, the one from the oil —once again he forced me to turn around, brusque and courteous—.</t78> <t79>Let's go in.</t79>
<t80>We crossed a high-ceilinged lobby to a pink and luminous space, which was tenuously connected to the house by two glass doors.</t80> <t81>The glass doors were ajar and shone, white, in contrast with the fresh grass outside, which almost seemed to enter the house.</t81> <t82>A light breeze blew in the room: it fluttered the curtains like pale flags divided between the inside and the outside, twisted them towards the ceiling, a sort of wedding cake, and rippled the wine-colored tapestry, darkening it, like the wind darkens the sea.</t82>
<t83>The only object that remained absolutely still in the room was a huge sofa on which two young women floated as if on a balloon tethered to the ground.</t83> <t84>Both were dressed in white, and their dresses billowed and fluttered as if they had just arrived from a fleeting flight around the house.</t84> <t85>I had to stand for a while, listening to the whipping of the curtains and the creaking of a picture on the wall.</t85> <t86>Then there was an explosion: Tom Buchanan had closed the rear windows, and the trapped wind in the room ceased, and the curtains, tapestries, and the dresses of the two women slowly settled back to the floor.</t86>
<t87>I didn't know the youngest one.</t87> <t88>She had lain down in the part of the sofa she occupied, completely still, with her chin slightly raised, as if balancing something that was about to collapse.</t88> <t89>If she had seen me out of the corner of her eye, she didn't show it, and I almost found myself murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by entering the room.</t89>
<t90>The other girl, Daisy, made a motion to get up —she leaned forward with a determined expression—, and then she laughed, with an absurd and charming giggle, and I laughed too and moved closer.</t90>
<t91>—I am pa… paralyzed with happiness.</t91>
<t92>She laughed again, as if she had said something very clever, and held my hand for a moment, looking into my eyes, promising that there was no one in the world she wished to see more.</t92> <t93>That was how she was.</t93> <t94>She whispered to me that the young acrobat's last name was Baker.</t94> <t95>(I have heard it said that the only purpose of Daisy's whisper was to make people lean towards her: an irrelevant criticism that did not diminish her charm.)</t95>
<t96>But Miss Baker's lips moved, she leaned almost imperceptibly to greet me, and immediately straightened up again: the object she was balancing had wobbled and given her a fright.</t96> <t97>Once again, a sort of apology came to my lips.</t97> <t98>In the face of displays of absolute self-sufficiency, I almost always surrender, stunned.</t98>
<t99>I looked again at my cousin, who began asking me questions in a deep, disturbing voice.</t99> <t100>It was one of those voices that the ear follows in its descents and ascents, as if each phrase were a succession of notes that would never sound together again.</t100> <t101>She had a sad and delightful face, with luminous details —the luminous eyes and the passionate light of the mouth— and there was an emotion in her voice that the men who had loved her could not forget: a singing vehemence, a whispered "hear me," the promise that she had just lived happy and vibrant moments and that happy and vibrant moments awaited in the next hour.</t101>
<t102>I told her that I had spent a day in Chicago, on my way to the East, and that everyone had sent kisses for her.</t102>
<t103>—Do you miss me? —she exclaimed, ecstatic.</t103>
<t104>—The entire city is desolate.</t104> <t105>All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a sign of mourning, and at night, the weeping on the northern shore of the lake never ends[4].</t105>
<t106>—It's wonderful!</t106> <t107>We have to go back, Tom! Tomorrow! —and incoherently added—.</t107> <t108>You have to see the girl.</t108>
<t109>—I would love to.</t109>
<t110>—She is sleeping.</t110> <t111>She is three years old.</t111> <t112>Have you never seen her?</t112>
<t113>—Never.</t113>
<t114>—Well, you have to see it.</t114> <t115>It's…</t115>
<t116>Tom Buchanan, who had not stopped pacing around the room, stopped and put a hand on my shoulder.</t116>
<t117>—What do you do for a living, Nick?</t117>
<t118>—I'm selling bonds.</t118>
<t119>—With whom?</t119>
<t120>I told him/her.</t120>
<t121>—It's the first time I've heard those names —he pointed out bluntly.</t121>
<t122>It bothered me.</t122>
<t123>—You will hear them —I cut him off—.</t123> <t124>You will hear them if you stay in the East.</t124>
<t125>—I will stay in the East, yes, don't worry —he said, looking at Daisy and then at me again, as if he expected us to add something—.</t125> <t126>I would be a fucking idiot if I lived anywhere else.</t126>
<t127>Then Miss Baker let out a "Of course!" so unexpected that it startled me: they were the first words she had spoken since I had entered the room.</t127> <t128>That surprised her as much as it did me, evidently, because she yawned and with a series of quick and agile movements stood up.</t128>
<t129>—I can't move —she complained—.</t129> <t130>I've been lying on that couch since I can remember.</t130>
<t131>—Don't look at me —replied Daisy—.</t131> <t132>I've been trying to take you to New York all afternoon.</t132>
<t133>—No, thank you —said Miss Baker, at the sight of the four cocktails arriving from the kitchen at that precise moment—.</t133> <t134>I am in the middle of training.</t134>
<t135>Her host looked at her incredulously.</t135>
<t136>—Trainings! —Tom drank the cocktail as if it were a drop at the bottom of a glass—.</t136> <t137>I don't understand how you achieve what you achieve.</t137>
<t138>I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what she was achieving.</t138> <t139>I enjoyed watching her.</t139> <t140>She was a slim girl, with small breasts, who walked very upright, something she accentuated by throwing her shoulders back like a cadet.</t140> <t141>Her eyes, gray and irritated by the sun, met mine with equal curiosity from a sad, friendly, unsatisfied face.</t141> <t142>Then I realized that I had seen her somewhere before, in person or in a photo.</t142>
<t143>—You live in West Egg —he stated with disdain—.</t143> <t144>I know someone from there.</t144>
<t145>—I don't know a single one...</t145>
<t146>—You have to meet Gatsby.</t146>
<t147>—Gatsby? —asked Daisy—.</t147> <t148>Which Gatsby?</t148>
<t149>Before I could tell him that he was my neighbor, dinner was announced; forcefully and peremptorily intertwining his arm with mine, Tom Buchanan dragged me out of the room as if moving a piece on a chessboard.</t149>
<t150>Thin and languid, with their hands resting weightlessly on their hips, the two young women preceded us onto the pink porch, open to the sunset, where, on the table, a gentle breeze made the light of four candles tremble.</t150>
<t151>—Why candles? —protested Daisy, frowning.</t151> <t152>She extinguished them with her fingers—.</t152> <t153>The longest day of the year will be in two weeks —she looked at us radiantly—.</t153> <t154>Don’t you spend the whole year waiting for the longest day to come and then, when it arrives, you don’t even notice?</t154> <t155>I spend the whole year waiting for the longest day to come and when it arrives, I don’t even notice.</t155>
<t156>—We have to plan something —yawned Miss Baker, sitting at the table as if she were getting into bed.</t156>
<t157>—Wonderful —said Daisy—.</t157> <t158>What can we plan? —she turned to me, uncertain—.</t158> <t159>What do people plan?</t159>
<t160>Before he could answer, he stared at his pinky finger with an expression of horror.</t160>
<t161>—Look! —he complained—.</t161> <t162>I've hurt myself.</t162>
<t163>We all looked.</t163> <t164>He had a bruise on his knuckle.</t164>
<t165>—It was you, Tom —she said, accusing her husband—.</t165> <t166>I know it was unintentional, but it was you.</t166> <t167>That's what I get for marrying a brute, a hulk, an enormous, immeasurable specimen of a…</t167>
<t168>—I can't stand the word mole —said Tom, annoyed—, not even as a joke.</t168>
<t169>—A monster —insisted Daisy.</t169>
<t170>Sometimes Miss Baker and she would talk at the same time, without raising their voices, with a playful incoherence that never descended into mere chatter, as unperturbed as their white dresses, as their impersonal eyes free of any desire.</t170> <t171>There they were, and they accepted Tom and me, making an effort, perhaps out of politeness and kindness, to entertain us or entertain themselves.</t171> <t172>They knew that dinner would soon end, as would the evening, which would be forgotten without much importance.</t172> <t173>It was very different in the West, where an evening would rush from phase to phase towards its end in a succession of always disappointed expectations or in the pure anguish of the moment.</t173>
<t174>—You make me feel like an uncivilized being, Daisy —I confessed over the second glass of a claret with a slight cork taste, but impressive—.</t174> <t175>Can’t you talk about harvests or something like that?</t175>
<t176>I didn't mean anything in particular with my observation, but it was received in an unexpected way.</t176>
<t177>—Civilization is collapsing —Tom burst out—.</t177> <t178>I've become terribly pessimistic.</t178> <t179>Have you read The Rise of the Colored Empires, by a certain Goddard?[5]</t179>
<t180>—The truth is, no —I replied, surprised by his tone.</t180>
<t181>—Well, it's a great book, and everyone should read it.</t181> <t182>Its thesis is that, if we don't stay on guard, the white race will end up... will end up completely sinking.</t182> <t183>It's a scientific fact, proven.</t183>
<t184>—Tom is becoming very profound —said Daisy, with a careless air of sadness—.</t184> <t185>He reads profound books, full of very long words.</t185> <t186>What was that word that…?</t186>
<t187>—Well, they are scientific books —insisted Tom, looking at her impatiently—.</t187> <t188>That Goddard has delved deeply into the matter.</t188> <t189>It is up to us, as the dominant race, to remain vigilant so that the other races do not take control of everything.</t189>
<t190>—We have to crush them —murmured Daisy, winking fiercely at the blazing sun.</t190>
<t191>—You should live in California —started Miss Baker, but Tom interrupted her, stirring heavily in his chair.</t191>
<t192>—The idea is that we are Nordics.</t192> <t193>I am Nordic, and you, and you, and... —after an infinitesimal moment of doubt, he included Daisy by slightly bowing his head, and Daisy winked at me again—.</t193> <t194>And we have produced all the things that constitute civilization, yes, science and art, and everything else.</t194> <t195>Do you understand?</t195>
<t196>There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his self-sufficiency, deeper than ever, was no longer enough for him.</t196> <t197>When, almost immediately, the phone rang inside the house and the butler stepped out of the porch, Daisy took advantage of the pause and leaned towards me.</t197>
<t198>—I'm going to tell you a family secret —he murmured enthusiastically—.</t198> <t199>It's about the butler's nose.</t199> <t200>Do you want to know the story of the butler's nose?</t200>
<t201>—That's why I've come tonight.</t201>
<t202>—Well, he hasn't always been a butler: he used to clean the silverware for certain people in New York who had silverware for two hundred people.</t202> <t203>He spent all day cleaning it from morning till night, until it started affecting his nose...</t203>
<t204>—Things went from bad to worse —suggested Miss Baker.</t204>
<t205>—Yes.</t205> <t206>Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to leave the job.</t206>
<t207>For an instant, with romantic affection, the last light of the sun shone on her face, radiant: her voice made me lean towards her as I listened without breathing.</t207> <t208>And then the radiance disappeared, each of the lights left her with sorrow, unwilling to go, like those children who have to leave the pleasure of the street at dusk.</t208>
<t209>The butler returned and whispered a few words into Tom's ear, who frowned, pushed the chair away from the table, and without a word, went into the house.</t209> <t210>As if that absence had accelerated something inside her, Daisy came closer to me again, and her voice lit up, it sang.</t210>
<t211>—What a joy to see you at my table, Nick.</t211> <t212>You remind me of... a rose, exactly a rose.</t212> <t213>Don't you think? —he turned to Miss Baker for confirmation—.</t213> <t214>Exactly a rose, right?</t214>
<t215>It wasn't true.</t215> <t216>I don't look anything like a rose.</t216> <t217>Daisy was just improvising, but she exuded an exciting warmth, as if her heart wanted to escape and hide in one of those broken, disturbing words.</t217> <t218>Then, suddenly, she threw the napkin onto the table and went into the house.</t218>
<t219>Miss Baker and I exchanged a lightning glance, deliberately devoid of meaning.</t219> <t220>I was about to speak when she straightened up in her chair, alert, and said "Shhh," warning me.</t220> <t221>From the adjoining room came muffled and passionate murmurs, and Miss Baker leaned forward, without any shame, to try to listen.</t221> <t222>The murmur vibrated on the edge of coherence, grew weaker, rose in a kind of outburst, and ceased definitively.</t222>
<t223>—That Mr. Gatsby you talk about is my neighbor —I said.</t223>
<t224>—Quiet.</t224> <t225>I want to find out what's happening.</t225>
<t226>—Is something wrong? —I asked innocently.</t226>
<t227>—Are you telling me that you don't know? —said Miss Baker, genuinely surprised—.</t227> <t228>I thought everyone knew.</t228>
<t229>—Not me.</t229>
<t230>—Ah… —she said, hesitantly—.</t230> <t231>Tom has a wife, in New York.</t231>
<t232>—A woman? —I repeated, not understanding.</t232>
<t233>Miss Baker nodded.</t233>
<t234>—You could have the decency not to call him at dinner time.</t234> <t235>Don't you think?</t235>
<t236>Almost before I grasped the meaning of his words, we heard the rustle of a dress and the creak of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.</t236>
<t237>—It was inevitable! —exclaimed Daisy with forced cheerfulness.</t237>
<t238>He sat down, looked scrutinizingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued:</t238>
<t239>—I peeked into the garden for a moment.</t239> <t240>How romantic!</t240> <t241>There is a bird on the lawn that must be a nightingale arrived on a transatlantic ship from the Cunard or White Star Line company.</t241> <t242>It is singing… —and her voice sang—.</t242> <t243>Don't you think it's romantic, Tom?</t243>
<t244>—Very romantic —replied Tom before addressing me in a dejected tone—.</t244> <t245>If there's still light after dinner, I'd like to take you to the stables.</t245>
<t246>The phone rang inside the house like an alarm and, while Daisy shook her head emphatically looking at Tom, the idea of the stables, and all ideas, vanished into the air.</t246> <t247>Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at the table, I remember that they had relit the candles, who knows why, and that I was aware of wanting to look deeply at everyone, and yet, I avoided looking at anyone.</t247> <t248>I was unable to guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I wasn't sure that Miss Baker, who seemed to possess an unbreakable skepticism, could overlook the shrill and metallic urgency of the fifth diner.</t248> <t249>For certain temperaments, the situation might have been suggestive.</t249> <t250>My instinct urged me to call the police immediately.</t250>
<t251>Nobody, it goes without saying, mentioned the horses again.</t251> <t252>Tom and Miss Baker, separated by a meter of twilight, headed to the library, as if to keep vigil over a perfectly tangible corpse, while I, trying to appear pleasantly interested and a bit deaf, followed Daisy through a series of galleries that branched off from the porch.</t252> <t253>We sat in the dim light, on a wicker sofa.</t253>
<t254>Daisy put her face in her hands as if to feel her perfect features, and her gaze gradually lost itself in the velvet darkness.</t254> <t255>I realized that she was overwhelmed by the strength of her emotions and, thinking it would calm her, I asked about the child.</t255>
<t256>—You and I don't know each other very well, Nick —he said suddenly—.</t256> <t257>Even though we are cousins.</t257> <t258>You didn't come to my wedding.</t258>
<t259>—He had not returned from the war.</t259>
<t260>—It's true —she hesitated—.</t260> <t261>Well, I've had a hard time, Nick, and I've become a cynic.</t261>
<t262>He evidently had reasons to be so.</t262> <t263>I waited, but he said nothing more, and after a moment I returned without much conviction to the subject of his daughter.</t263>
<t264>—I suppose it talks and… eats, and those things.</t264>
<t265>—Ah, yes —he looked at me, absent-mindedly—.</t265> <t266>Hey, Nick: let me tell you what I said when she was born.</t266> <t267>Do you want to know?</t267>
<t268>—Of course.</t268>
<t269>—That will show you what I have come to feel about… everything.</t269> <t270>Well, the girl was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where.</t270> <t271>I woke up from the anesthesia with a feeling of deep abandonment, and I asked the nurse if it was a boy or a girl.</t271> <t272>She told me it was a girl, and I turned my head and started to cry.</t272> <t273>“Great,” I said, “I’m glad it’s a girl.</t273> <t274>And I hope she’s a fool.</t274> <t275>That’s the best thing a girl can be in this world: a beautiful little fool.”</t275> <t276>You see, I think life is terrible —she continued, very convinced—.</t276> <t277>Everyone thinks so, the people with the most advanced ideas.</t277> <t278>And I know it.</t278> <t279>I’ve been everywhere, I’ve seen everything and I’ve done everything —she cast a defiant look around, in Tom’s manner, and laughed with impressive disdain—.</t279> <t280>Sophisticated…</t280> <t281>My God, how sophisticated I am!</t281>
<t282>As soon as the voice faded and stopped demanding my attention and trust, I became aware of the basic insincerity of everything that had been said.</t282> <t283>And I felt uncomfortable, as if the whole evening had been a trap to extract a sentimental contribution from me.</t283> <t284>I waited and, indeed, at that moment she looked at me with a splendid smile of satisfaction, as if she had confessed to me her membership in a distinguished secret society to which both she and Tom were affiliated.</t284>
<t285>Inside the house, the crimson living room bloomed with light.</t285> <t286>Tom and Miss Baker sat at the ends of the wide sofa, and Miss Baker read aloud an article from the Saturday Evening Post: the words, in a whisper, without inflections, blended into a melody of soothing effects.</t286> <t287>The lamp light gleamed on the riding boots, lost its shine in Miss Baker's autumn yellow hair, and flashed on the paper every time she turned the page and the delicate muscles of her arms pulsed.</t287>
<t288>When we entered, he made us, raising a hand, keep silent for a few seconds.</t288>
<t289>—To be continued —he said, and threw the magazine onto the table— in our next issue.</t289>
<t290>The body asserted its power with an impatient movement of the knees, and Miss Baker stood up.</t290>
<t291>—Ten o'clock —he noted, as if checking the time on the ceiling—.</t291> <t292>It's time for this good girl to go to bed.</t292>
<t293>—Jordan is participating in the Westchester tournament tomorrow —explained Daisy.</t293>
<t294>—Ah, you are Jordan Baker!</t294>
<t295>Now I knew why her face seemed familiar to me: that pleasant and disdainful expression had looked at me from many photogravure pictures in the news pages about the sporting life in Asheville, Hot Springs, and Palm Beach.</t295> <t296>Gossip about her had also reached me, a negative and unpleasant story that I had long forgotten.</t296>
<t297>—Good night —he said in a low voice—.</t297> <t298>Would you mind waking me up at eight?</t298>
<t299>—If you plan to get up.</t299>
<t300>—I plan to get up.</t300> <t301>Good night, Mister Carraway.</t301> <t302>We will see each other soon.</t302>
<t303>—Of course, you will see each other soon —confirmed Daisy—.</t303> <t304>And I even plan to organize a wedding.</t304> <t305>Come often, Nick, and I will see to it… oh, how to bring you together.</t305> <t306>You know…</t306> <t307>Accidentally lock you in a closet, or throw you into the sea in a boat, things like that…</t307>
<t308>—Good evening —said Miss Baker from the stairs—.</t308> <t309>I haven't heard a single word.</t309>
<t310>—She is a wonderful girl —said Tom after a while—.</t310> <t311>They shouldn't let her travel around the country like that.</t311>
<t312>—Who shouldn't? —asked Daisy, coldly.</t312>
<t313>—His family.</t313>
<t314>—His family is an aunt who must be a thousand years old.</t314> <t315>Besides, Nick is going to take care of her, right, Nick?</t315> <t316>Jordan is going to spend quite a few weekends with us this summer.</t316> <t317>I think having a home will do him a lot of good.</t317>
<t318>Daisy and Tom looked at each other in silence for a moment.</t318>
<t319>—Are you from New York? —I asked immediately.</t319>
<t320>—From Louisville.</t320> <t321>There we spent our immaculate adolescence together.</t321> <t322>The immaculate and wonderful adolescence…</t322>
<t323>—Have you been telling secrets to Nick on the terrace?</t323> <t324>—asked Tom suddenly.</t324>
<t325>—Have I told you secrets? —Daisy looked at me—.</t325> <t326>I don't remember, but I think we have talked about the Nordic race.</t326> <t327>Yes, I am sure.</t327> <t328>Almost without realizing it, you know, the first thing that…</t328>
<t329>—Don't believe everything they tell you, Nick —Tom advised me.</t329>
<t330>I said nonchalantly that they hadn't told me anything, and a few minutes later I got up to go home.</t330> <t331>They accompanied me to the door and stopped, together, in a radiant square of light.</t331> <t332>As I started the car, Daisy shouted peremptorily: "Wait!"</t332>
<t333>—I forgot to ask you something important.</t333> <t334>We have received news that you got engaged to a girl from the West.</t334>
<t335>—It's true —Tom corroborated warmly—.</t335> <t336>They told us that you had gotten engaged.</t336>
<t337>—It's a lie.</t337> <t338>I am too poor.</t338>
<t339>—Well, they told us —insisted Daisy and, to my surprise, she was opening up again like a flower—.</t339> <t340>Three people told us, so it must be true.</t340>
<t341>Of course, I knew what they were referring to, but I was not even vaguely engaged.</t341> <t342>The fact that the gossip had announced the banns was one of the reasons I went East.</t342> <t343>You can't stop seeing an old friend because of rumors, and, on the other hand, I had no intention of getting married just because of what people said.</t343>
<t344>The interest of Tom and Daisy moved me quite a bit: they seemed closer, less remotely rich.</t344> <t345>However, already in the car, I felt confused and a little disgusted.</t345> <t346>I thought that Daisy's duty was to run out of the house with the child in her arms, although, apparently, she had no intention of doing such a thing.</t346> <t347>As for Tom, that he had "a woman in New York" was less surprising than the fact that a book had depressed him so much.</t347> <t348>Something drove him to gnaw at the most superficial aspects of a few stale ideas as if his physical, resounding selfishness was no longer enough to feed his pressing heart.</t348>
<t349>You could feel the summer on the rooftops of the roadside hotels and at the service stations, where the new, red pumps stood over pools of light, and when I arrived at my house in West Egg, I parked the car in the shed and sat for a while in the garden, on an abandoned lawnmower.</t349> <t350>The wind no longer blew, leaving a clear and noisy night, with wings flapping in the trees and the persistent sound of an organ, as if the powerful bellows of the earth were breathing life into the frogs.</t350> <t351>The silhouette of a cat moved hesitantly in the moonlight and, turning my head to look at it, I saw that I was not alone: about fifteen meters away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and stood, hands in pockets, contemplating the silvery pepper of the stars.</t351> <t352>Something in the slowness of his movements and the confidence with which he placed his feet on the grass suggested to me that it was the mysterious Gatsby, who had come out to calculate what part of the local firmament belonged to him.</t352>
<t353>I decided to call him.</t353> <t354>Miss Baker had mentioned his name during dinner, and that would serve as an introduction.</t354> <t355>But I didn't call him, because suddenly he seemed to feel comfortable alone: he extended his arms in a strange way towards the dark water and, although I was far away, I would have sworn he was trembling.</t355> <t356>I looked at the sea in an automatic gesture... and saw nothing, except for a green light, distant and tiny, which might have been the end of a dock.</t356> <t357>When I went to look at Gatsby again, he had disappeared, and I was alone once more in the restless darkness.</t357>
<t358>2</t358>
<t359>Halfway between West Egg and New York, the road suddenly converges with the railroad line and runs alongside it for about four hundred meters, as if trying to avoid a certain stretch of desolate land.</t359> <t360>It is a valley of ashes: a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat until they become ridges, hills, and grotesque gardens; where the ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and smoke and, finally, in a transcendental effort, of ash men who stir like shadows and dissolve into the dusty air.</t360> <t361>From time to time, a line of gray wagons crawls along an invisible track, shudders with a spectral creak, and stops, and immediately the ash men emerge like a swarm with shovels that seem made of lead and raise an impenetrable cloud that hides their mysterious operations from us.</t361>
<t362>But above the gray earth and the inhospitable gusts of dust that blow incessantly over it, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg can be distinguished after a moment.</t362> <t363>The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic: their pupils almost reach a meter in height.</t363> <t364>They do not look out from a face, but from enormous yellow glasses that rest on a nonexistent nose.</t364> <t365>Some foolish and joking oculist must have put them there to increase his clientele in the Queens area, and then sank into eternal blindness, or forgot them and went elsewhere.</t365> <t366>But his eyes, somewhat faded by the many days exposed to rain and sun without ever receiving a coat of paint, continue to meditate sadly over the solemn dump.</t366>
<t367>A dirty stream borders the valley of ashes on one of its flanks, and when the drawbridge rises to let the barges pass, the train passengers can spend half an hour contemplating the gloomy place while they wait.</t367> <t368>It is inevitable to stop there, even if only for a moment, and precisely for that reason, I met Tom Buchanan's mistress.</t368>
<t369>The fact that he had a lover was much talked about in the circles that Tom frequented.</t369> <t370>His friends considered it an offense that he would show up with her in trendy bars and, leaving her at a table, would walk around the place, chatting with one person and another.</t370> <t371>I was curious to see her, but I didn't want to be introduced to her, as eventually happened.</t371> <t372>One afternoon I went with Tom to New York by train, and when we stopped next to the heaps of ash, he jumped up and, grabbing me by the elbow, literally forced me to get off the carriage.</t372>
<t373>—We get off —he emphasized the obvious—.</t373> <t374>I want to introduce you to my girl.</t374>
<t375>I think I had drunk too much at lunch, and the determination with which he forced me to accompany him bordered on violence.</t375> <t376>His arrogance assumed that on a Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.</t376>
<t377>I followed him when he jumped over the train barrier, painted white, and we retreated about a hundred meters down the road under the persistent gaze of Doctor Eckleburg.</t377> <t378>The only building in sight was a yellow brick house that stood at the edge of the wasteland, on a sort of minimal main street that was enough to meet its needs and led to absolute nothingness.</t378> <t379>There were three businesses: one was for rent and another was a restaurant that stayed open all night and was reached by an ash path.</t379> <t380>The third was a garage —Repairs.</t380> <t381>GEORGE B. WILSON.</t381> <t382>Car dealership—, into which I followed Tom.</t382>
<t383>The interior, empty, was miserable: the only visible car was the dusty remains of a Ford, huddled in a dark corner.</t383> <t384>I was thinking that this ghostly garage could only be a smokescreen hiding luxurious and romantic apartments upstairs, when the owner appeared at the office door, wiping his hands with a rag.</t384> <t385>He was a blond man, timid, anemic, and of a certain faded beauty.</t385> <t386>He saw us, and his eyes, blue, moist, and very clear, lit up with hope.</t386>
<t387>—Hello, old Wilson —said Tom jovially, giving him a pat on the shoulder—.</t387> <t388>How's it going?</t388>
<t389>—I can't complain —replied Wilson, convincing no one—.</t389> <t390>When are you going to sell me the car?</t390>
<t391>—Next week: I have the driver fixing it.</t391>
<t392>—He doesn't hurry, does he?</t392>
<t393>—You are mistaken —said Tom coldly—.</t393> <t394>But, if you believe so, perhaps it would be best to sell the car to someone else.</t394>
<t395>—That's not what I'm saying —Wilson hastened to explain—.</t395> <t396>What I'm saying is that…</t396>
<t397>Her voice faded away, and Tom looked around impatiently.</t397> <t398>Then I heard footsteps on the stairs and, in a moment, the heavy silhouette of a woman blocked the light from the office door.</t398> <t399>She must have been about thirty-five years old, and she was a bit overweight, but she carried her flesh with that sensuality that some women are capable of.</t399> <t400>There were no features or hints of beauty in her face, which emerged from a dark blue polka-dotted silk dress, but that woman possessed an immediately perceptible vitality, as if the nerves in her body were always on edge.</t400> <t401>She smiled calmly, and passing through her husband as if he were a ghost, she shook Tom's hand, looking him intensely in the eyes.</t401> <t402>She licked her lips and, without turning, said to her husband in a soft and ordinary voice:</t402>
<t403>—Bring chairs, so people can sit down.</t403>
<t404>—Ah, yes —Wilson immediately agreed, and went to the office, blending in at once with the cement color of the walls.</t404>
<t405>White and ashen dust covered his dark suit and pale hair as it covered everything around him, except for his wife, who had approached Tom.</t405>
<t406>—I want to see you —said Tom decisively—.</t406> <t407>Take the next train.</t407>
<t408>—Very well.</t408>
<t409>—Wait for me at the newspaper stand on the lower platform.</t409>
<t410>The woman nodded and moved away from Tom at the precise moment when George Wilson was coming out of the office with two chairs.</t410>
<t411>We waited for her on the road, where they couldn't see us.</t411> <t412>There were only a few days left until the Fourth of July, and an Italian boy, gray and scrawny, was placing a row of firecrackers on the train tracks.</t412>
<t413>—Terrible place, isn't it? —said Tom, exchanging a look of disgust with Doctor Eckleburg.</t413>
<t414>—Horrible.</t414>
<t415>—It suits her to go out.</t415>
<t416>—Doesn't the husband mind?</t416>
<t417>—Wilson?</t417> <t418>He thinks he's going to New York to see his sister.</t418> <t419>He's so dumb he doesn't even know he's alive.</t419>
<t420>So Tom Buchanan, his girl, and I went to New York together.</t420> <t421>Or not exactly together, because Mrs. Wilson traveled discreetly in another car.</t421> <t422>It was a courtesy from Tom towards the sensitivity of the East Egg residents who might be on the train.</t422>
<t423>Mistress Wilson had changed her dress to a brown muslin one with a print that clung tightly to her wide hips when Tom helped her alight at the New York platform.</t423> <t424>At the newsstand, she bought the Town Tattle and a movie magazine, and at the station's drugstore, she bought face cream and a perfume.</t424> <t425>Upstairs, in the solemn, echo-filled entrance, she rejected four taxis before choosing a new lavender-colored one with gray upholstery, and in it, we drove away from the grand station into the splendid sunlight.</t425> <t426>But immediately Mistress Wilson stopped paying attention to the window, leaned forward, and knocked on the glass that separated us from the driver.</t426>
<t427>—I want one of those dogs —she said very seriously—.</t427> <t428>I want one for the apartment.</t428> <t429>It's good to have... a dog.</t429>
<t430>We backed up in search of an old gray man who absurdly resembled John D. Rockefeller.</t430> <t431>In a basket hanging from his neck, a handful of newborn puppies of indeterminate breed cowered in fear.</t431>
<t432>—What kind of dogs are they? —asked Mistress Wilson with genuine excitement, as the man approached the taxi window.</t432>
<t433>—Of all types.</t433> <t434>What type are you looking for, ma'am?</t434>
<t435>—I would like a police dog, but I suppose you don't have any of that breed.</t435>
<t436>The man looked with uncertain eyes into the basket, put his hand in, and took out a puppy that wouldn't stop moving, grabbing it by the neck.</t436>
<t437>—It is not a police dog —said Tom.</t437>
<t438>—No, it's not exactly a police dog —said the man, with some disappointment—.</t438> <t439>I would rather say it's an Airedale —he ran his hand over the brown back, which looked like a dishcloth—.</t439> <t440>Look at the hair.</t440> <t441>What hair.</t441> <t442>This dog will never bother you with a cold.</t442>
<t443>—I think it's beautiful —said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically—.</t443> <t444>How much does it cost?</t444>
<t445>—This dog? —the man looked at him with true admiration—.</t445> <t446>For you, it will be ten dollars.</t446>
<t447>The Airedale—undoubtedly some remote Airedale had been implicated in the matter, although those paws were strikingly white—changed owners and ended up in the lap of Mistress Wilson, who caressed that weatherproof fur with rapture.</t447>
<t448>—Is it a boy or a girl? —he said gently.</t448>
<t449>—This dog?</t449> <t450>It's a boy.</t450>
<t451>—It's a bitch —said Tom definitively—.</t451> <t452>Here is your money.</t452> <t453>Go and buy yourself ten more dogs.</t453>
<t454>We entered Fifth Avenue, warm and drowsy, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon.</t454> <t455>I wouldn't have been surprised to see a large flock of white sheep appear at a corner.</t455>
<t456>—Stop —I said—.</t456> <t457>I have to leave you here.</t457>
<t458>—Nothing of the sort —Tom interrupted me—.</t458> <t459>Myrtle would be offended if you don't come up to the apartment.</t459> <t460>Right, Myrtle?</t460>
<t461>—Come on —mistress Wilson insisted to me—.</t461> <t462>I will call my sister Catherine on the phone.</t462> <t463>Those who know say she is very beautiful.</t463>
<t464>—I would like to go, but…</t464>
<t465>We did not stop, we cut through Central Park towards the west and the Hundred streets again.</t465> <t466>On One Hundred and Fifty-Eighth Street, the taxi stopped in front of a piece of the great white cake of an apartment building.</t466> <t467>Throwing a queenly glance at the neighborhood as she returned home, Mistress Wilson grabbed the dog and her other purchases and entered the house with an air of grandeur.</t467>
<t468>—I'm going to call the McKees —he announced as we were going up in the elevator—.</t468> <t469>And my sister, of course.</t469>
<t470>The apartment was in the attic: a small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom, and a bathroom.</t470> <t471>Up to the door of the living room, the furniture, upholstered and too large, accumulated, and taking a step meant stumbling over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles.</t471> <t472>The only picture was a very enlarged, blurred photograph of what seemed to be a hen perched on a rock.</t472> <t473>Viewed from afar, however, the hen turned into a bonnet, and the countenance of an elderly and corpulent lady shone in the room.</t473> <t474>On the table were several back issues of Town Tattle, a copy of Simon Called Peter[7], and some Broadway gossip magazines.</t474> <t475>Mistress Wilson took care of the dog first of all.</t475> <t476>A reluctant elevator operator went to get milk and a crate with straw, to which he added on his own initiative a can of large, hard dog biscuits, one of which spent the afternoon dissolving apathetically in the bowl of milk.</t476> <t477>And meanwhile, Tom took a bottle of whiskey from a locked dresser.</t477>
<t478>I've only gotten drunk twice in my life, and the second time was that afternoon, so a confusing layer of fog clouds everything that happened, although a splendid sun illuminated the apartment until past eight.</t478> <t479>Sitting on top of Tom, Mistress Wilson called several people on the phone, and then the cigarettes ran out, so I went down to buy some at the corner store.</t479> <t480>When I came back, the lovers had disappeared, and I prudently sat in the living room and read a chapter of Simon, called Peter: it was either infamous or the whiskey was distorting things, because it made no sense at all.</t480>
<t481>At the moment when Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink, Mistress Wilson and I were on a first-name basis) reappeared, the guests started to arrive at the apartment.</t481>
<t482>The sister, Catherine, was a thin and worldly woman of about thirty years, red-haired, shaved like a boy and styled with hair gel, and of a milky, cosmetic whiteness.</t482> <t483>She had plucked her eyebrows and repainted them at a more elegant angle, but nature's efforts to restore the old line gave her face an incoherent expression.</t483> <t484>When Catherine moved, the jingling of the numerous cheap bracelets on her arms produced an incessant tinkling.</t484> <t485>She entered with such an anxious proprietorial air, and looked at the furniture so possessively, that I thought perhaps it was her house.</t485> <t486>But I asked her and she laughed exaggeratedly, repeating my question out loud.</t486> <t487>She told me she lived with a friend in a hotel.</t487>
<t488>Mister McKee was a feminine, pale man, the neighbor from the floor below.</t488> <t489>He had just shaved, because he had a white spot of foam on his cheek, and he showed extraordinary respect when greeting everyone present.</t489> <t490>He informed me that he worked "in the artistic world," and later I found out that he was a photographer and that he had made the blurry enlargement of Mrs. Wilson's mother that floated on the wall like an ectoplasm.</t490> <t491>His wife was shrill, languid, beautiful, and horrible.</t491> <t492>She told me proudly that her husband had photographed her one hundred and twenty-seven times since their wedding day.</t492>
<t493>Mistress Wilson had changed clothes shortly before, and now she was wearing a complicated cream-colored chiffon evening dress that left a constant rustle in its wake as she moved around the room.</t493> <t494>Under the influence of the dress, her personality also underwent a change.</t494> <t495>The intense vitality of the garage, so perceptible, had transformed into an impressive fatuity.</t495> <t496>Her laughter, her gestures, her statements became more affected by the moment, and, as she expanded, the room shrank around her, until, noisy and creaking, Mistress Wilson seemed to spin on a pedestal in the smoke-filled air.</t496>
<t497>—Darling —she shouted to her sister, with a prim and sharp voice—, all those people will always deceive you.</t497> <t498>They only think about money.</t498> <t499>A woman came last week to fix my feet and, when she gave me the bill, it was as if I had had an appendectomy.</t499>
<t500>—What was her name? —asked Mistress McKee.</t500>
<t501>—Mistress Eberhardt.</t501> <t502>She dedicates herself to fixing feet at home.</t502>
<t503>—I love your dress —observed Mistress McKee—.</t503> <t504>I think it's wonderful.</t504>
<t505>Mistress Wilson rejected the compliment by disdainfully raising an eyebrow.</t505>
<t506>—It's really old —he said—.</t506> <t507>I only wear it when I don't care about how I look.</t507>
<t508>—Well, it suits you wonderfully, I don't know if you understand me —continued Mistress McKee—.</t508> <t509>If Chester photographed you in that pose, he would make something worthwhile.</t509>
<t510>We all looked silently at Mistress Wilson, who brushed a lock of hair away from her eyes and returned our gaze with a radiant smile.</t510> <t511>Mister McKee studied her attentively, tilting his head, and then put his hand in front of his face and moved it back and forth.</t511>
<t512>—I would change the light —he said after a moment—.</t512> <t513>I would like to highlight the modeling of the features, and I would try to capture the hair at the nape of the neck.</t513>
<t514>—I wouldn't change the light —proclaimed Mistress McKee—.</t514> <t515>It seems to me that it is…</t515>
<t516>Her husband said "Shhh" and we all turned to look at the model again, when Tom yawned audibly and stood up.</t516>
<t517>—Have a drink, folks —he said to the McKees—.</t517> <t518>Bring more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everyone falls asleep.</t518>
<t519>—Look, I told the boy to bring ice —Myrtle raised her eyebrows, desperate over the laziness of the lower classes—.</t519> <t520>What people!</t520> <t521>You have to be behind them all the time.</t521>
<t522>He looked at me and laughed for no reason.</t522> <t523>Then he picked up and kissed the dog in a fit of passion and entered the kitchen majestically as if a team of cooks were waiting for his orders.</t523>
<t524>—In Long Island, I have done very interesting things —declared Mr. McKee.</t524>
<t525>Tom looked at him without understanding.</t525>
<t526>—We have two of them framed downstairs.</t526>
<t527>—Two what? —asked Tom.</t527>
<t528>—Two studies.</t528> <t529>One I have titled Montauk Point: the seagulls, and the other Montauk Point: the sea.</t529>
<t530>Catherine, the sister, sat next to me on the sofa.</t530>
<t531>—Do you also live in Long Island? —she asked me.</t531>
<t532>—I live in West Egg.</t532>
<t533>—Yes?</t533> <t534>I was there at a party, about a month ago.</t534> <t535>At the house of a certain Gatsby.</t535> <t536>Do you know him?</t536>
<t537>—He/She lives next to my house.</t537>
<t538>—They say he is the nephew or cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm.</t538> <t539>That's why he has so much money.</t539>
<t540>—Yes?</t540>
<t541>He nodded.</t541>
<t542>—I'm scared.</t542> <t543>I wouldn't like it at all if he/she took it out on me.</t543>
<t544>This fascinating information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mistress McKee, who suddenly pointed at Catherine with her finger.</t544>
<t545>—Chester, I think you could do something with her —he proclaimed, but Mr. McKee just nodded with a bored air and turned his attention back to Tom.</t545>
<t546>—If I could introduce myself, I would like to work more in Long Island.</t546> <t547>The only thing I ask is that they let me start.</t547>
<t548>—Talk to Myrtle —said Tom, letting out a laugh and taking advantage of mistress Wilson arriving from the kitchen with a tray—.</t548> <t549>She will give you a letter of introduction, right, Myrtle?</t549>
<t550>—Give what? —she asked, surprised.</t550>
<t551>—You will give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do a few studies of him —he kept moving his lips, silently, as he made it up—.</t551> <t552>George B. Wilson at the gas pump, or something like that.</t552>
<t553>Catherine leaned over me, very close, and whispered in my ear:</t553>
<t554>—Neither of them can stand the person they are married to.</t554>
<t555>—No?</t555>
<t556>—They can't stand them —he looked at Myrtle and then at Tom—.</t556> <t557>And I say: why do they keep living with those people if they can't stand them?</t557> <t558>If I were them, I would get a divorce and remarry immediately.</t558>
<t559>—Does she not want Wilson either?</t559>
<t560>The response was unexpected, because it came from Myrtle, who had heard my question.</t560> <t561>And it was violent and obscene.</t561>
<t562>—You see —exclaimed Catherine triumphantly.</t562> <t563>She lowered her voice again—.</t563> <t564>It's his wife who separates them.</t564> <t565>She's Catholic, and Catholics don't believe in divorce.</t565>
<t566>Daisy wasn't Catholic, and the elaborate nature of the lie impressed me a bit.</t566>
<t567>—When they get married —continued Catherine— they will go West for a while, until everything has passed.</t567>
<t568>—It would be more discreet to go to Europe.</t568>
<t569>—Ah, do you like Europe? —he exclaimed, surprising me—.</t569> <t570>I just returned from Monte Carlo.</t570>
<t571>—Yes?</t571>
<t572>—Last year.</t572> <t573>I went with another girl.</t573>
<t574>—Were you there for a long time?</t574>
<t575>—No, we went to Monte Carlo and came back.</t575> <t576>We went via Marseille.</t576> <t577>We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, and in two days we were fleeced down to the last cent.</t577> <t578>We had a terrible time on the way back, I can assure you.</t578> <t579>My God, what a dreadful city!</t579>
<t580>The evening sky, resembling the blue honey of the Mediterranean, shone for a moment in the window, and then the shrill voice of Mistress McKee brought me back to the room.</t580>
<t581>—I also almost made a mistake —she asserted energetically—.</t581> <t582>I was about to marry an insignificant Jew who had been after me for years.</t582> <t583>I knew he was not up to my standards.</t583> <t584>And everyone told me: "Lucille, that man is not up to your standards."</t584> <t585>But he would have gotten his way, for sure, if I hadn't met Chester.</t585>
<t586>—Yes, but listen —said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down—, at least you didn't get married.</t586>
<t587>—Of course.</t587>
<t588>—I did get married —said Myrtle, in a tone of ambiguity.</t588>
<t589>—Why did you get married, Myrtle? —asked Catherine—.</t589> <t590>No one forced you.</t590>
<t591>Myrtle pondered the answer.</t591>
<t592>—I got married because I thought he was a gentleman —she finally said—.</t592> <t593>I thought he knew what a good upbringing was, but he wasn't even worth cleaning my shoes with his tongue.</t593>
<t594>—Well, for a while you were crazy about him —said Catherine.</t594>
<t595>—Crazy about him! —exclaimed Myrtle incredulously—.</t595> <t596>Who said I was crazy about him?</t596> <t597>I've never been crazier about him than about that man.</t597>
<t598>Suddenly, he pointed at me with his finger, and everyone looked at me accusingly.</t598> <t599>I tried to make my expression clear that I did not aspire to any kind of appreciation.</t599>
<t600>—My only madness was getting married.</t600> <t601>And I immediately knew that I had made a mistake.</t601> <t602>He borrowed his best suit from I don't know who for the wedding, and he didn't say a word to me, and the man came for his suit one day when my husband wasn't home.</t602> <t603>"Ah, the suit is yours?" I said, "well, now I know."</t603> <t604>I gave it to him and then I lay on the bed and spent the afternoon crying nonstop.</t604>
<t605>—He would have to separate —Catherine summarized to me—.</t605> <t606>They have been living in the attic of that garage for eleven years.</t606> <t607>And Tom is the first friend he has had.</t607>
<t608>The bottle of whisky—the second one—was now in high demand by everyone present, except for Catherine, who "felt fine without anything."</t608> <t609>Tom called the concierge and sent him out for some famous sandwiches that were as good as a full dinner.</t609> <t610>I felt like leaving and walking east towards the park, in the soft twilight, but every time I tried to say goodbye, I found myself entangled in some noisy, senseless discussion that held me back, as if I had been tied up.</t610> <t611>Dominating the city, however, our row of illuminated windows would offer its share of human secrets to the occasional observer of the dark streets, someone who was also me, watching and marveling.</t611> <t612>I was both inside and outside, at once enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.</t612>
<t613>Myrtle drew her chair closer, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.</t613>
<t614>—It was in those two small seats, one facing the other, which are always the last to be free on the train.</t614> <t615>I was going to New York to see my sister and spend the night.</t615> <t616>Tom was dressed in formal attire, with patent leather shoes, and I couldn't take my eyes off him, but if he looked at me, I pretended to read the advertisement above his head.</t616> <t617>When we arrived at the station, I felt him close, and the white front of his shirt pressed against my arm, so I told him I was going to call a policeman, but he knew it wasn't true.</t617> <t618>I was so excited when I got into the taxi with him that I barely realized we weren't taking the subway.</t618> <t619>The only thing I kept thinking, over and over, was: "You are not going to live forever; you are not going to live forever."</t619>
<t620>He turned towards Mistress McKee and his artificial laugh echoed in the room.</t620>
<t621>—Darling —she exclaimed—, I'll give you the dress as soon as I take it off.</t621> <t622>Tomorrow I plan to buy another one.</t622> <t623>I'm going to make a list of all the things I need.</t623> <t624>A massage and a perm, a collar for the dog, one of those lovely ashtrays with a device to swallow the ash, and a crown with a black silk ribbon for my mother's grave, that lasts all summer.</t624> <t625>I'm going to make a list of all the things I have pending so I don't forget them.</t625>
<t626>It was nine o'clock, and almost immediately I looked at the clock and saw that it was ten.</t626> <t627>Mr. McKee had fallen asleep in his chair, with his fists clenched on his lap.</t627> <t628>He looked like the picture of a man of action.</t628> <t629>I took the handkerchief and wiped the dried shaving foam from his cheek that had bothered me all afternoon.</t629>
<t630>The little dog looked from atop the table, blinded by the smoke, and occasionally whimpered weakly.</t630> <t631>People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then got lost, searched for each other, and found themselves a meter apart.</t631> <t632>Around midnight, Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson, standing face to face, argued passionately about whether Mrs. Wilson had the right to say Daisy's name.</t632>
<t633>—Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! Dai..! —shouted Mistress Wilson—.</t633> <t634>I'll say it as many times as I want!</t634>
<t635>With a sharp and swift movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with an open hand.</t635>
<t636>Then there were towels soaked in blood on the bathroom floor, and indignant voices of women, and, above the confusion, an endless and intermittent moan of pain.</t636> <t637>Mr. McKee woke up and groggily searched for the door.</t637> <t638>He had not finished leaving when he turned and saw the scene: Catherine and his wife, who were shouting and protesting and trying to offer some comfort while, with things from the first aid kit in hand, they stumbled over all the furniture that crowded the room, and the desperate figure on the sofa, who kept bleeding and tried to protect the upholstery with pages from Town Tattle and its scenes of Versailles.</t638> <t639>Then Mr. McKee turned around and resumed his way to the door.</t639> <t640>I grabbed my hat from the candelabrum where I had left it, and followed him.</t640>
<t641>—Come over for a meal one day —he suggested, as the elevator descended and groaned.</t641>
<t642>—Where to?</t642>
<t643>—Anywhere.</t643>
<t644>—Don't touch the lever —complained the elevator operator.</t644>
<t645>—Excuse me —said Mr. McKee very dignifiedly—.</t645> <t646>I didn't realize.</t646>
<t647>—Great —I said—.</t647> <t648>It will be a pleasure.</t648>
<t649>… And then I was standing, next to the bed, and Mr. McKee, between the sheets and in his underwear, sitting, had a large folder in his hands.</t649>
<t650>—Beauty and the Beast… Solitude…</t650> <t651>The horse from the old grocery store…</t651> <t652>The Brooklyn Bridge…</t652>
<t653>Afterwards, I found myself collapsed, half asleep, on the deepest and coldest platform of Pennsylvania Station, staring at the first edition of the Tribune and waiting for the four o'clock morning train.</t653>
<t654>3</t654>
<t655>Music came from my neighbor's house on summer nights.</t655> <t656>In their blue gardens, men and girls went to and fro like moths among the whisperings, the champagne, and the stars.</t656> <t657>When the tide rose in the evenings, I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while two motorboats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam.</t657> <t658>On weekends, his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains.</t658> <t659>And on Mondays, eight servants, including an extra gardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.</t659>
<t660>A fruit shop in New York sent five boxes of lemons and oranges every Friday, and every Monday those same lemons and oranges went out the back door in a pyramid of pulp-less peels.</t660> <t661>In the kitchen, there was a machine that could squeeze two hundred oranges in half an hour if the butler's thumb pressed a button two hundred times.</t661>
<t662>At least once every fortnight, an army of suppliers would show up with more than a hundred meters of canvas and enough colored lights to turn Gatsby's enormous garden into a Christmas tree.</t662> <t663>On the buffet tables, adorned with dazzling hors d'oeuvres, spiced hams jostled against harlequin salads, pork pies, and turkeys the color of old gold, as if enchanted.</t663> <t664>In the main hall, they set up a bar, with an authentic metal footrail, stocked with gins, alcoholic beverages, and liqueurs forgotten for so long that most of the female guests were too young to distinguish one from another.</t664>
<t665>At seven o'clock the orchestra arrived, not just a simple quintet, but a whole band of oboes and saxophones and trombones and violas and cornets and piccolos and bass drums and snare drums.</t665> <t666>The last swimmers have just returned from the beach and are getting dressed upstairs; cars from New York are parked five deep in the driveway, and the lobbies, the salons, and the galleries already attract attention with their primary colors and the latest, most unusual hairstyles, and shawls that surpass the dreams of ancient Castile.</t666> <t667>The bar is buzzing with activity, and the incessant rounds of cocktails float through the garden, permeating it, and even the air is enlivened with conversations and laughter, and insignificant insinuations and instantly forgotten introductions, and enthusiastic encounters between women who have never known each other's names.</t667>
<t668>The lights become more intense as the Earth drifts away from the sun, and the orchestra plays cocktail music, and the opera of voices rises a tone.</t668> <t669>Laughter becomes easier, more abundant, spilling over at any cheerful word.</t669> <t670>The groups change more quickly, grow with newcomers, dissolve and form in the same breath; now you see, wandering, self-assured girls weaving between more solid and stable guests, becoming for a fleeting and happy moment the center of a group, and, with the thrill of triumph, disappearing silently into the sea of faces and voices and colors under the ever-changing light.</t670>
<t671>Suddenly, one of those gypsy women, vibrant in her opal dress, catches a cocktail in mid-air, bravely drinks it in one gulp, and, moving her hands like Frisco[8], dances alone on the canvas floor.</t671> <t672>Momentary silence: the orchestra conductor is forced to match the girl's rhythm, and gossip spreads as the false news circulates that she is Gilda Gray's[9] understudy in the Follies.</t672> <t673>The party has begun.</t673>
<t674>I believe that the first night I was at Gatsby's house, I was one of the few who had actually been invited.</t674> <t675>People were not invited: they went.</t675> <t676>They got into cars that took them to Long Island, and, somehow, they ended up at Gatsby's door.</t676> <t677>Once there, someone who knew Gatsby introduced them and, from that moment on, they behaved according to the conduct norms typical of amusement parks.</t677> <t678>And some nights they arrived and left without even meeting Gatsby: they came to the party with a naivety of heart that served as their entry.</t678>
<t679>I was truly invited.</t679> <t680>A chauffeur in a turquoise blue uniform, the color of a robin's egg, crossed the lawn of my house early Saturday morning with an astonishingly formal note from his employer: Gatsby would be very honored, it said, if I could attend his "little party" that night.</t680> <t681>He had seen me several times, and for a long time had intended to pay me a visit, but a singular combination of circumstances had prevented it.</t681> <t682>It was signed Jay Gatsby, in majestic handwriting.</t682>
<t683>Clad in a brand-new white flannel suit, I stepped onto his lawn a little after seven and wandered uncomfortably among swirls of people I didn't know, though occasionally I spotted a face I had seen on the train.</t683>
<t684>I was impressed by the number of young English people everywhere: all well-dressed, all looking hungry, all speaking softly and very seriously to solid and prosperous Americans.</t684> <t685>I assumed they were selling something: bonds, insurance, or automobiles.</t685> <t686>At the very least, they were painfully aware of the easy money circulating around and were convinced it would be theirs in exchange for a few words in just the right tone.</t686>
<t687>As soon as I arrived, I tried to greet my host, but the two or three people I asked about him looked at me so astonished and denied so vehemently knowing Gatsby's whereabouts that I slipped away towards the cocktail table, the only place in the garden where someone without company could stay for a while and not seem alone and lost.</t687>
<t688>I had decided out of sheer bewilderment to get scandalously drunk when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stopped at the top of the marble staircase to, leaning back a little, observe the garden with interest and disdain.</t688>
<t689>Whether they received me well or badly, I thought it necessary to stick to someone before I started getting affectionate with everyone who passed by.</t689>
<t690>—Hello! —I roared, advancing towards her.</t690>
<t691>My voice, in the garden, sounded too loud, abnormal.</t691>
<t692>—I had thought that maybe you were here —he replied absentmindedly as I climbed the stairs—.</t692> <t693>I remembered that you lived in the house next door…</t693>
<t694>He took my hand in an impersonal manner, as a promise that he would take care of me in a few seconds, and listened to two girls who were wearing identical yellow dresses and had stopped at the foot of the staircase.</t694>
<t695>—Hello! —they shouted in unison—.</t695> <t696>It's a shame you didn't win.</t696>
<t697>They were talking about the golf tournament.</t697> <t698>Jordan Baker had lost in the finals the previous week.</t698>
<t699>—You don't know who we are —said one of the girls in yellow—, but we met you here about a month ago.</t699>
<t700>—You have dyed your hair —replied Jordan, and I was startled, but the girls had continued on their way carelessly, and the words were heard by the premature moon, which had undoubtedly come out, like dinner, from the supplier's basket.</t700>
<t701>With Jordan's slender, golden arm resting on mine, we descended the staircase and wandered through the garden.</t701> <t702>A tray of cocktails floated towards us in the twilight, and we sat at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, who all introduced themselves as mister Mmmm.</t702>
<t703>—Do you come to these parties often?</t703> <t704>—Jordan asked the girl next to him.</t704>
<t705>—The last one was when I met you —replied the girl with a confident, energetic voice.</t705> <t706>She turned to her friend—.</t706> <t707>You too, right, Lucille?</t707>
<t708>That's how it was.</t708>
<t709>—I love coming here —said Lucille—.</t709> <t710>I don't mind doing anything, so I always have a good time.</t710> <t711>Last time, my dress got torn by a chair, and he asked for my name and address, and before a week had passed, I received a package from Croirier with a new evening gown.</t711>
<t712>—Did you stay with him? —asked Jordan.</t712>
<t713>—Of course.</t713> <t714>I was going to wear it tonight, but it's too loose in the chest and I need to fix it.</t714> <t715>It's gas blue with lavender decorations.</t715> <t716>Two hundred sixty-five dollars.</t716>
<t717>—A guy who does those things is not normal —said the other girl vehemently—.</t717> <t718>He doesn't want to have problems with anyone.</t718>
<t719>—Who doesn't want to have problems? —I asked.</t719>
<t720>—Gatsby.</t720> <t721>Someone told me...</t721>
<t722>The two girls and Jordan brought their heads together confidentially.</t722>
<t723>—Someone told me that he once killed a man.</t723>
<t724>We all felt a shiver.</t724> <t725>The three Mister Mmmm also leaned in, eager to listen.</t725>
<t726>—I don't think it will go that far —replied Lucille, skeptical—.</t726> <t727>It's more likely that he was a spy for the Germans during the war.</t727>
<t728>One of the men confirmed it:</t728>
<t729>—I heard it from a man who knew him well.</t729> <t730>He had grown up with him in Germany —he assured us categorically.</t730>
<t731>—No —said the first girl—, that's impossible, because he fought in the American army —seeing that she was regaining our belief, she leaned towards us with enthusiasm—.</t731> <t732>Watch him when he thinks no one is looking.</t732> <t733>I'm sure he killed a man.</t733>
<t734>He half-closed his eyes and shivered.</t734> <t735>Lucille shivered.</t735> <t736>We all turned to look where Gatsby was.</t736> <t737>Proof of the romantic speculations he inspired was that those who had found little to gossip about in this world murmured at his expense.</t737>
<t738>They had started serving the first dinner (they served another after midnight), and Jordan invited me to join her group at a table on the other side of the garden.</t738> <t739>There were three married couples and Jordan's date, an insistent student who was fond of unpleasant insinuations and had the obvious impression that, sooner or later, Jordan was going to give herself to him to a greater or lesser degree.</t739> <t740>Instead of scattering, the group had maintained an honorable homogeneity, assuming the representation of the very serious rural nobility: East Egg showed its condescension towards West Egg but did not lower its guard against its spectroscopic joy.</t740>
<t741>—Let's go —murmured Jordan after a rather insipid and wasted half hour—; this is too fancy for me.</t741>
<t742>We got up, and he explained to the group that we were going to look for the host; I didn't know him, he said, and that made me feel uncomfortable.</t742> <t743>The student nodded with a melancholic, cynical gesture.</t743>
<t744>There were many people in the bar, where we looked first, but Gatsby was not there.</t744> <t745>Jordan did not see him from the top of the staircase, and he was not in the gallery either.</t745> <t746>We randomly opened a door that seemed important and entered a Gothic library, with high ceilings and walls covered in carved English oak, probably transported whole from some overseas ruin.</t746>
<t747>A corpulent individual, middle-aged, with enormous glasses and owl-like eyes, somewhat drunk, was sitting on the edge of a large table and, hesitantly, was concentrating on looking at the bookshelves.</t747> <t748>When we entered, he turned around nervously and examined Jordan from head to toe.</t748>
<t749>—What do you think? —he asked with genuine fervor.</t749>
<t750>—What?</t750>
<t751>He pointed towards the books with his hand.</t751>
<t752>—That.</t752> <t753>And you don't have to bother checking it.</t753> <t754>I've checked it myself.</t754> <t755>They are real.</t755>
<t756>—The books?</t756>
<t757>He nodded.</t757>
<t758>—Absolutely true: they have pages and all those things.</t758> <t759>I thought they would be hollow, sturdy cardboard.</t759> <t760>But they are absolutely real.</t760> <t761>Pages and… Look, let me show you.</t761>
<t762>Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the shelves and returned with the first volume of Stoddard's Lectures[10].</t762>
<t763>—Look! —he exclaimed triumphantly—.</t763> <t764>It is an authentic piece of printed material.</t764> <t765>He had managed to deceive me.</t765> <t766>This guy is a true Belasco[11].</t766> <t767>What a triumph! What meticulousness!</t767> <t768>What realism!</t768> <t769>And he also knew where to stop: the pages are uncut, unopened.</t769> <t770>But what did you expect? What did you want?</t770>
<t771>He snatched the book from me and hurriedly returned it to its shelf, muttering that if we removed one brick, the entire library might collapse.</t771>
<t772>—Who brought you here? —he asked—.</t772> <t773>Or did you come on your own?</t773> <t774>I was brought here.</t774> <t775>Almost everyone is brought here.</t775>
<t776>Jordan watched him very attentively, happy, without responding.</t776>
<t777>—A woman named Roosevelt brought me here —he continued—.</t777> <t778>Mistress Claud Roosevelt.</t778> <t779>Don't you know her?</t779> <t780>I met her last night, I don't know where.</t780> <t781>I've been drunk for almost a week, and I thought sitting in a library for a while might clear my head.</t781>
<t782>—Has it worked?</t782>
<t783>—A little, yes, I think.</t783> <t784>It's still early to say.</t784> <t785>I've only been here for an hour.</t785> <t786>Did I tell you about the books?</t786> <t787>They are real.</t787> <t788>They are...</t788>
<t789>—He has told us.</t789>
<t790>We shook his hand solemnly and left.</t790>
<t791>Now they danced on the garden floor: old men who pushed the girls in desolate eternal circles, high-class couples who embraced tortuously, fashionably, never leaving the corners, and many girls who danced alone and occasionally took over for the banjo or the percussionist of the orchestra.</t791> <t792>At midnight the joy had increased.</t792> <t793>A famous tenor sang in Italian, a well-known contralto sang jazz, and between numbers people put on their own sensational show anywhere in the garden, while laughter burst out and, empty and happy, rose to the summer sky.</t793> <t794>Two twin actresses, who turned out to be the girls in yellow, dressed up as little girls for their performance, and champagne was served in glasses larger than fruit bowls.</t794> <t795>The moon was higher and over the strait floated a triangle of silver scales, which trembled slightly with the dry and metallic tapping of the banjos in the garden.</t795>
<t796>I was still with Jordan Baker.</t796> <t797>We were at a table with a man roughly my age and a girl who made a lot of noise and at the slightest provocation would burst into uncontrollable laughter.</t797> <t798>I was amused.</t798> <t799>I had drunk two champagne cocktails and the scene had transformed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.</t799>
<t800>In a moment of respite at the party, the man looked at me and smiled.</t800>
<t801>—Your face looks familiar to me —he said, very politely—.</t801> <t802>Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?</t802>
<t803>—Yes, yes.</t803> <t804>I was in the Twenty-Eighth Infantry.</t804>
<t805>—I was in the Sixteenth until June of the year '18.</t805> <t806>I knew I had seen you somewhere.</t806>
<t807>We chatted for a while about the damp and gray villages of France.</t807> <t808>Evidently, he lived in the neighborhood because he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to test it in the morning.</t808>
<t809>—Are you coming with me, buddy?</t809> <t810>Only to the shore, through the strait.</t810>
<t811>—What time?</t811>
<t812>—Whichever one you prefer.</t812>
<t813>I was about to ask her name, I had the question on the tip of my tongue, when Jordan looked around and smiled.</t813>
<t814>—Are you finally having a good time?</t814>
<t815>—Much better —I turned again to my new friend—.</t815> <t816>This party seems very strange to me.</t816> <t817>I haven't even seen the host.</t817> <t818>I live over there —I waved my hand towards the hedge, invisible in the distance—, and that Gatsby sent me an invitation with the chauffeur.</t818>
<t819>He looked at me for a moment as if he didn't understand me.</t819>
<t820>—I am Gatsby —he said suddenly.</t820>
<t821>—Sorry —I exclaimed—.</t821> <t822>I beg you to forgive me.</t822>
<t823>—I thought you knew, buddy.</t823> <t824>I think I'm not a good host.</t824>
<t825>He looked at me with understanding, much more than with understanding.</t825> <t826>It was one of those rare smiles capable of calming us for all eternity, which we only encounter four or five times in life.</t826> <t827>That smile was offered —or seemed to be offered— to the entire and eternal world, only to then focus on you, exclusively on you, with an irresistible predisposition in your favor.</t827> <t828>He understood you as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you wanted to believe in yourself, and guaranteed that the impression he had of you was the one that, in your best moments, you hoped to produce.</t828> <t829>And then the smile vanished, and I was looking at a young and elegant thug, one or two years over thirty, with a way of speaking so ceremonious and affected that it bordered on the absurd.</t829> <t830>Even before he introduced himself, I had the feeling that he chose his words carefully.</t830>
<t831>Almost at the same moment that Gatsby identified himself, the butler came running up to tell him that he had a call from Chicago.</t831> <t832>He excused himself with a slight bow to each of us.</t832>
<t833>—If you need anything, just ask, buddy —he told me—.</t833> <t834>Excuse me.</t834> <t835>I'll see you later.</t835>
<t836>As soon as he left, I turned to Jordan because I needed to share my surprise with her.</t836> <t837>I expected Mr. Gatsby to be a middle-aged man, fat and ruddy.</t837>
<t838>—Who is it? —I asked—.</t838> <t839>Do you know?</t839>
<t840>—It's just someone named Gatsby.</t840>
<t841>—Yes, but where is he from? What does he do?</t841>
<t842>—You have also gotten into the matter —he replied with a faint smile—.</t842> <t843>Well, one day he told me that he had studied at Oxford.</t843>
<t844>A blurry past was taking shape behind Gatsby, but it dissolved with Jordan's next sentence:</t844>
<t845>—But I don't believe it.</t845>
<t846>—Why not?</t846>
<t847>—I don't know —he insisted—.</t847> <t848>But I don't believe he went to Oxford.</t848>
<t849>Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl, "I think he killed a man," and it had the effect of piquing my curiosity.</t849> <t850>I would have easily accepted the information that Gatsby had emerged from the swamps of Louisiana or the East Side of New York.</t850> <t851>That was understandable.</t851> <t852>But —as far as my provincial experience allowed me to suppose— a young man does not calmly come out of nowhere and buy a palace in Long Island.</t852>
<t853>—The thing is, he throws very crowded parties —said Jordan, changing the subject with a polite annoyance at the specifics—.</t853> <t854>And I like parties with lots of people.</t854> <t855>They are very intimate.</t855> <t856>At parties with few people, intimacy is nonexistent.</t856>
<t857>The drum boomed, and the voice of the orchestra conductor suddenly rose among the echolalia of the garden.</t857>
<t858>—Ladies and gentlemen —he shouted—.</t858> <t859>At the request of Mr. Gatsby, we are going to play for all of you the latest work of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff, which garnered so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May.</t859> <t860>If you read the newspapers, you will know that it caused a real sensation —he smiled with jovial condescendence, and added—.</t860> <t861>What a sensation! —and everyone burst into laughter.</t861>
<t862>—The piece —he concluded energetically— is titled The History of the World in Jazz, according to Vladimir Tostoff.</t862>
<t863>The nature of mister Tostoff's composition escaped me because, just as it was starting, I saw Gatsby, who, alone, was looking approvingly at the various groups from the marble staircase.</t863> <t864>His face was tanned, his skin smooth, attractive, and it seemed that his hair, very short, was groomed every day.</t864> <t865>I found nothing sinister about him.</t865> <t866>I wondered if the fact that he didn't drink helped him stand out from his guests, as it seemed to me that he became more and more proper as the fraternal joy increased.</t866> <t867>When The History of the World in Jazz ended, the girls rested their heads on the men's shoulders like teenagers, the girls fell backward, fainting, jokingly, into the men's arms, or among the group, knowing that someone would catch their fall.</t867> <t868>But no one let themselves fall into Gatsby's arms, and no bobbed haircut touched Gatsby's shoulder and no quartet included him among their singers.</t868>
<t869>—Excuse me.</t869>
<t870>Gatsby's butler was suddenly at our side.</t870>
<t871>—Miss Baker? —he asked—.</t871> <t872>Sorry to bother you, but Mister Gatsby would like to speak with you alone.</t872>
<t873>—With me? —exclaimed Jordan, surprised.</t873>
<t874>—Yes, madame.</t874>
<t875>He got up slowly, looked at me, and raised his eyebrows in astonishment, then followed the butler towards the house.</t875> <t876>I noticed that he was wearing evening attire, and all his clothes, as if they were sportswear.</t876> <t877>His movements had a special grace: it seemed as if he had learned to walk on the fresh and clear mornings of the golf courses.</t877>
<t878>He was alone and it was almost two o'clock.</t878> <t879>Confusing and enigmatic noises had been coming for a while from a room with many windows that opened onto the terrace.</t879> <t880>Eluding Jordan's student, who was at that moment engrossed in a conversation about obstetrics with two chorus girls and was begging for my company, I entered the house.</t880>
<t881>The living room was full of people.</t881> <t882>One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her, standing, a young red-haired lady, a member of a famous revue company, was singing a song.</t882> <t883>She had drunk a considerable amount of champagne and, quite unprofessionally, during the course of the song decided that everything was very sad, very sad: not only was she singing, she was also crying.</t883> <t884>She introduced sobs and broken hiccups into each pause of the song, before returning to the lyrics with a trembling soprano voice.</t884> <t885>Tears ran down her cheeks; not with complete freedom, however, because when they came into contact with her heavily painted eyelashes, they took on an inky color and continued their path in slow black streams.</t885> <t886>Someone humorously suggested that she sing the notes written on her face, at which point she raised her hands, collapsed into an armchair, and sank into the deep sleep of wine.</t886>
<t887>—She fought with a man who claims to be her husband —explained a girl next to me.</t887>
<t888>I looked around.</t888> <t889>Most of the women who remained were fighting with men who claimed to be their husbands.</t889> <t890>Even Jordan's group, the East Egg quartet, had broken up, divided by dissension.</t890> <t891>One of the men was talking with unusual intensity to a very young actress, and his wife, after trying to laugh off the situation with dignity and indifference, completely lost control and resorted to flanking attacks.</t891> <t892>She would suddenly appear again and again like an angry diamond and whisper in her husband's ear: "You promised me!"</t892>
<t893>The resistance to going home was not exclusive to the disobedient men.</t893> <t894>The lobby was now occupied by two lamentably sober men and their absolutely indignant wives.</t894> <t895>The women had hit it off and were speaking slightly louder.</t895>
<t896>—Whenever she sees that I'm having a good time, she wants to go home.</t896>
<t897>—I have never met anyone so selfish.</t897>
<t898>—We always leave first.</t898>
<t899>—And us.</t899>
<t900>—Well, tonight we are almost the last ones —one of the men said timidly—.</t900> <t901>The orchestra left half an hour ago.</t901>
<t902>Despite the women agreeing that such malevolence was inconceivable, the discussion ended in a brief scuffle, and the two women were lifted off their feet and, kicking, disappeared into the night.</t902>
<t903>While I was waiting in the lobby to be given my hat, the library door opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.</t903> <t904>He was saying a final sentence, but the anxiety he showed quickly turned into the strictest formality when several people approached him to say goodbye.</t904>
<t905>Jordan's group was calling her impatiently from the porch, but she lingered for a moment to shake my hand.</t905>
<t906>—I just found out something amazing, the most amazing thing I've ever heard —he murmured—.</t906> <t907>How long have we been in there?</t907>
<t908>—One hour, more or less.</t908>
<t909>—It has been… simply amazing —she repeated, distracted—.</t909> <t910>But I have sworn not to tell anyone, and here I am, tempting you with what I cannot give you —she yawned in my face very elegantly—.</t910> <t911>Come see me, please… Phone book…</t911> <t912>The number of mistress Sigourney Howard…</t912> <t913>My aunt… —she was leaving quickly as she spoke, and her tanned hand gave me a cheerful wave as she melted into the group at the door.</t913>
<t914>A little embarrassed for having stayed so late on my first visit, I joined Gatsby's last guests, who were gathering around him.</t914> <t915>I wanted to explain that I had been looking for him at the beginning of the party and apologize for not having recognized him in the garden.</t915>
<t916>—Don't worry —he ordered me categorically—.</t916> <t917>Don't overthink it, buddy —there was no more familiarity in that familiar expression than in the comforting hand he placed on my shoulder—.</t917> <t918>And don't forget that tomorrow morning we test the hydroplane at nine.</t918>
<t919>And the butler, behind him:</t919>
<t920>—They are calling you from Philadelphia, sir.</t920>
<t921>—Yes, right away.</t921> <t922>Say that I'll be right there...</t922> <t923>Good night.</t923>
<t924>—Good evening.</t924>
<t925>—Good night —he smiled, and suddenly it seemed that being among the last to leave had a heartfelt significance, as if that was what Gatsby had wished for from the beginning—.</t925> <t926>Good night, buddy…</t926> <t927>Good night.</t927>
<t928>But as I was going down the stairs, I saw that the party hadn't ended yet.</t928> <t929>About fifteen meters from the door, the headlights of the cars illuminated a strange and tumultuous scene.</t929> <t930>On the road, in the ditch, without having overturned but having lost a wheel due to the violence of the impact, lay a new coupe that had left the driveway of Gatsby's house less than two minutes before.</t930> <t931>A pronounced protrusion on the wall explained the loss of the wheel, which now attracted the full attention of a group of curious chauffeurs.</t931> <t932>But, as they had blocked the road with their cars, the loud and dissonant protest of those coming behind had been heard for a while, and that increased the violent confusion of the scene.</t932>
<t933>A man with a very long coat had gotten out of the wrecked car and, in the middle of the road, his eyes went from the car to the wheel and from the wheel to the spectators, friendly and perplexed at the same time.</t933>
<t934>—Look, it has gone into the ditch.</t934>
<t935>The fact genuinely astonished him, and I first recognized that unusual sense of wonder, and then the individual: it was the user of Gatsby's library.</t935>
<t936>—How has it been?</t936>
<t937>He shrugged.</t937>
<t938>—I have no idea about mechanics —he said emphatically.</t938>
<t939>—But how did it happen? Did he crash into the wall?</t939>
<t940>—Don't ask me —said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the accident—.</t940> <t941>I don't have much idea about driving, almost none.</t941> <t942>It happened, and that's all I know.</t942>
<t943>—Well, if they don't drive well, they shouldn't drive at night.</t943>
<t944>—But I don't know how to drive —he responded, indignant—.</t944> <t945>I have never driven in my life.</t945>
<t946>A reverential silence enveloped the onlookers.</t946>
<t947>—Do you want to commit suicide?</t947>
<t948>—You're lucky it was only a wheel!</t948> <t949>You don't know how to drive!</t949> <t950>You had never even driven a car in your life!</t950>
<t951>—They don't understand me —explained the criminal—.</t951> <t952>I wasn't driving.</t952> <t953>There is another man in the car.</t953>
<t954>The impression caused by this statement was heard in an endless "Ahhh" as the car door opened very slowly.</t954> <t955>The crowd—it was already a crowd—instinctively stepped back, and when the door finished opening, an eerie silence ensued.</t955> <t956>Then, very slowly, bit by bit, a pale and staggering individual emerged from the wrecked car, tentatively feeling the ground with an enormous dancing shoe.</t956>
<t957>Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant wailing of the horns, the apparition staggered for a few seconds before noticing the man in the lab coat.</t957>
<t958>—What's wrong? —he asked very calmly—.</t958> <t959>Have we run out of gas?</t959>
<t960>—Look!</t960>
<t961>Half a dozen fingers pointed towards the amputated wheel.</t961> <t962>He stared at it for a moment and then looked up as if he suspected it had rained down from the sky.</t962>
<t963>—It has come loose.</t963>
<t964>He nodded.</t964>
<t965>—At first, I didn't realize that we had stopped.</t965>
<t966>Silence.</t966> <t967>Then, taking a breath and standing up very straight, he asked decisively:</t967>
<t968>—Could you tell me where there is a gas station?</t968>
<t969>At least a dozen men, some barely in better condition than him, explained to him that the wheel and the car were no longer connected by any kind of material bond.</t969>
<t970>—Back out —he suggested after a moment—.</t970> <t971>Put it in reverse.</t971>
<t972>—But it's missing a wheel!</t972>
<t973>The man hesitated.</t973>
<t974>—Nothing is lost by trying —he said.</t974>
<t975>The howl of the horns was increasing.</t975> <t976>I turned around and, stepping on the grass, went home.</t976> <t977>I turned back to look once.</t977> <t978>The moon, like a host, shone over Gatsby's house so that the night was as beautiful as before: it had survived the laughter and the noises of the garden, still illuminated.</t978> <t979>A sudden emptiness now seemed to flow from the immense windows and doors, enveloping the host in absolute isolation, who remained on the porch, with his hand raised in a formal gesture of farewell.</t979>
<t980>Upon rereading what I have written, I believe I may have given the impression that the events of three nights, separated by several weeks, completely absorbed me.</t980> <t981>Quite the opposite: they were merely insignificant events in a very busy summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my own affairs.</t981>
<t982>I spent most of the time working.</t982> <t983>Early in the morning, the sun cast my shadow to the west as I hurriedly descended the white abysses that lead from the lower part of New York to the Probity Trust.</t983> <t984>I knew the other employees and the young bond salesmen by their names, and in crowded, dark restaurants, I ate with them pork sausages, mashed potatoes, and coffee.</t984> <t985>I even had a brief affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother started giving me dirty looks, and when the girl went on vacation in July, I ended the matter.</t985>
<t986>I used to have dinner at the Yale Club—I don't know why, but that was the saddest event of the day—and then I would go up to the library and diligently study investments and securities for an hour.</t986> <t987>There were always a few revelers around, but they never entered the library, so it was a good place to work.</t987> <t988>Afterwards, if the night was nice, I would take a walk down Madison Avenue, pass the old Murray Hall Hotel, and, via Thirty-third Street, reach Pennsylvania Station.</t988>
<t989>I was beginning to like New York, the nighttime sensation of adventure and risk, and the pleasure that the constant fluctuation of men, women, and vehicles provided to the restless gaze.</t989> <t990>I liked to walk along Fifth Avenue and choose some romantic woman from the crowd and imagine that, in five minutes, I would enter her life, and that no one would ever know it nor disapprove of it.</t990> <t991>Sometimes, in my imagination, I followed her to her apartment, on the corner of some hidden street, and she would turn and smile at me before crossing a door and vanishing into the warmth and darkness.</t991> <t992>In the enchanted twilight of the metropolis, some days the loneliness became obsessive, and I even felt it in others, young and poor employees who killed time in front of shop windows and waited for the hour to dine alone in a restaurant; young employees who, at nightfall, wasted the most wonderful moments of the night and of life.</t992>
<t993>At eight o'clock, once again, when the dimly lit roadway of the Forties streets filled with the hustle and bustle of taxis, lined up five in a row, heading to the theater district, I felt a tightness in my heart.</t993> <t994>The silhouettes inside the taxis waiting to move on merged, voices sang, jokes I couldn't hear elicited laughter, and lit cigarettes traced unintelligible spirals.</t994> <t995>Imagining that I too was rushing towards joy and sharing their deepest enthusiasm, I wished them the best.</t995>
<t996>I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and in the middle of summer, I met her again.</t996> <t997>At first, I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and everyone knew her.</t997> <t998>And then there was something more.</t998> <t999>It's not that I had fallen in love, but I felt a kind of curiosity, a tenderness.</t999> <t1000>The face of proud boredom she presented to the world hid something —almost all poses end up hiding something, if they don't hide it from the beginning—, and one day I discovered what it was.</t1000> <t1001>We had gone to a party in Warwick, and Jordan left the car that had been lent to her in the rain, without putting up the top, and then lied about the incident, and then it came to my mind what they said about her that I couldn't remember that night at Daisy's house.</t1001> <t1002>In her first major golf tournament, there was a scandal that almost made it to the newspapers: someone insinuated that in the semifinals, Jordan moved a ball that had fallen in a bad spot.</t1002> <t1003>The case reached scandalous proportions and then deflated.</t1003> <t1004>A caddy retracted his statements and the only witness admitted that he might have been mistaken.</t1004> <t1005>However, I retained the incident and the name.</t1005>
<t1006>Jordan Baker instinctively avoided intelligent and perceptive men, and then I understood that she did so because she felt safer in a sphere where deviating from the norm was practically impossible.</t1006> <t1007>She was an incurable cheat.</t1007> <t1008>She couldn't stand being at a disadvantage and, because of that negative trait, I suppose she had started resorting to subterfuge from a very young age to maintain that cold and insolent smile in front of the world and, at the same time, satisfy the demands of her strong and happy body.</t1008>
<t1009>I didn't care.</t1009> <t1010>That a woman cheats is something that no one criticizes too much.</t1010> <t1011>It bothered me at first, and then I forgot about it.</t1011> <t1012>At that party, at someone's house in Warwick, we had a curious conversation about how to drive a car.</t1012> <t1013>It started because she passed so close to some workers that the fender brushed a button on one of their jackets.</t1013>
<t1014>—You drive recklessly —I protested—.</t1014> <t1015>Either you become more careful, or you should stop driving.</t1015>
<t1016>—I'm being careful.</t1016>
<t1017>—No, you are not careful.</t1017>
<t1018>—Well, others are already being careful —he said without thinking twice.</t1018>
<t1019>—And what does that have to do with anything?</t1019>
<t1020>—They won't get in my way —he insisted—.</t1020> <t1021>It takes two to have an accident.</t1021>
<t1022>—Suppose you meet someone as reckless as you.</t1022>
<t1023>—I hope I never run into him —he replied—.</t1023> <t1024>I detest reckless people.</t1024> <t1025>That's why I like you.</t1025>
<t1026>His gray eyes, irritated by the sun, looked straight ahead, unflinching, but Jordan had astutely and deliberately altered the nature of our relationship, and for a moment I thought I loved her.</t1026> <t1027>But I think things through carefully and subject myself to a considerable number of inner rules that act as a brake on my desires, and I knew that my first obligation was to free myself from the mess I had left pending in my hometown.</t1027> <t1028>I wrote every week and kept signing: "With love, Nick," but the only thing I remembered was a girl who, when playing tennis, would get a fine mustache of sweat, and yet, there was a vague commitment that I had to break gently to feel free.</t1028>
<t1029>Everyone believes they possess at least one of the cardinal virtues.</t1029> <t1030>Mine is this: I am one of the few honest people I have known in my life.</t1030>
<t1031>4</t1031>
<t1032>On Sunday mornings, while the bells rang in the coastal churches, the whole world and its lover returned to Gatsby's house and gleamed with joy on the lawn.</t1032>
<t1033>—He is a liquor trafficker —said the young women, among flowers and cocktails—.</t1033> <t1034>Once, he killed a man who discovered he was the nephew of Van Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.</t1034> <t1035>Pick me a rose, darling, and fill that glass a little more.</t1035>
<t1036>Once I wrote down in the blank spaces of a train schedule the names of those who went to Gatsby's house that summer.</t1036> <t1037>It is an old schedule now, and it is falling apart at the folds.</t1037> <t1038>The heading says: "This schedule takes effect on July 5, 1922."</t1038> <t1039>But I can still read those gray names, which will give you a more accurate impression than my generalities about those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing about him.</t1039>
<t1040>From East Egg came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a certain Bunsen, whom I met at Yale, and Dr. Webster Civet, who drowned last summer in Maine.</t1040> <t1041>And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires, and the entire Blackbuck clan, who always gathered in a corner and wrinkled their noses like goats at anyone who approached them.</t1041> <t1042>And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or, more precisely, Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie's wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, against all reason, turned as white as cotton one winter afternoon, or so they say.</t1042>
<t1043>Clarence Endive was from East Egg, if I remember correctly.</t1043> <t1044>He only appeared once, in white golf pants, and got into a fight with a scoundrel, a certain Etty, in the garden.</t1044> <t1045>From more remote corners of the island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams from Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.</t1045> <t1046>Snell was at Gatsby's house three days before going to jail, so drunk that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's car ran over his right hand on the gravel path.</t1046> <t1047>The Dancies also came, and S. B. Whitebait, who was already a good sixty years old, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga, the tobacco importer, and Beluga's girls.</t1047>
<t1048>From West Egg came the Pole and the Mulready and Cecil Roebuck, and Cecil Schoen and Senator Gulick and Newton Orchid, who directed Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected in one way or another with the cinema.</t1048> <t1049>And the Catlip and the Bemberg and G. Earl Muldoon, brother of that Muldoon who later strangled his wife.</t1049> <t1050>Da Fontano, the promoter, also made an appearance, and Ed Legros and James B. (alias Ratkiller) Ferret and the De Jong and Ernest Lilly: they all came to play, and when Ferret was lost in the garden it meant he had been cleaned out and that the shares of Associated Traction would rise the next day.</t1050>
<t1051>A certain Klipspringer went so often and stayed so long that they ended up calling him "the Boarder": I doubt he had another home.</t1051> <t1052>From the world of theater were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull.</t1052> <t1053>Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, who have already divorced, and Henry L. Palmetto, who killed himself by jumping in front of the subway at Times Square.</t1053>
<t1054>Benny McClenahan always showed up with four girls.</t1054> <t1055>They were never the same, but they were all so identical that it inevitably seemed they had been at the house before.</t1055> <t1056>I have forgotten their names: Jacqueline, I think, or Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were melodious names of flowers and months, or, more austere, of the great American capitalists, of whom, if pressed hard enough, they would eventually confess to being cousins.</t1056>
<t1057>Besides all those people, I remember that Faustina O’Brien came at least once, and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who lost his nose to a bullet in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, who presided over the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with an individual who claimed to be her chauffeur, and the prince of I don’t know what, whom we called Duke, and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.</t1057>
<t1058>All those people went to Gatsby's house that summer.</t1058>
<t1059>At nine o'clock, on a late July morning, Gatsby's magnificent car rattled up the gravel path that led to my door and played an explosive three-note melody with its horn.</t1059> <t1060>It was the first time Gatsby had come to see me, although I had attended two of his parties, ridden in his hydroplane, and, at his persistent invitations, frequently used his beach.</t1060>
<t1061>—Good morning, comrade.</t1061> <t1062>Today you are eating with me and I thought we could go together in the car.</t1062>
<t1063>He balanced on the running board of the car with that ease of movement so characteristically American, which stems, I suppose, from the absence of heavy labor in youth and, even more, from the formless grace of our sports, so sporadic, so nervous.</t1063> <t1064>It was a quality that, in the form of agitation, showed through beneath his meticulous manners.</t1064> <t1065>He was never completely still: one foot kept tapping the ground or an impatient hand never stopped opening and closing.</t1065>
<t1066>He saw that he was looking at the car with admiration.</t1066>
<t1067>—It's beautiful, isn't it, buddy? —he jumped off the stirrup so I could admire it better—.</t1067> <t1068>Hadn't you seen it?</t1068>
<t1069>He had seen it.</t1069> <t1070>Everyone had seen it.</t1070> <t1071>It was of an intense cream color, with glittering chrome, and of a monstrous length, further exaggerated by a triumphant accumulation of compartments for hats, provisions, and tools, and a labyrinth of successive windshields that reflected a dozen suns.</t1071> <t1072>Protected by many layers of glass, in a sort of green leather greenhouse, we headed towards the city.</t1072>
<t1073>I might have spoken with Gatsby five or six times recently and had discovered, disappointedly, that he had little to say.</t1073> <t1074>So my first impression (that he was an interesting person, of an indefinite but certain interest) gradually faded away, and Gatsby simply became the owner of the ostentatious roadside lodge next to my house.</t1074>
<t1075>And then came that bewildering trip.</t1075> <t1076>We hadn't yet passed West Egg Village when Gatsby began to leave his most elegant sentences unfinished and to slap his caramel-colored suit's knee uncertainly with the palm of his hand.</t1076>
<t1077>—Tell me, comrade —he suddenly blurted out—, what do you think of me?</t1077>
<t1078>A bit overwhelmed, I resorted to the evasions and generalities that such a question deserves.</t1078>
<t1079>—Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life —he interrupted me—.</t1079> <t1080>I don't want you to get the wrong idea about me with all those stories you must have heard.</t1080>
<t1081>So he knew all the absurd accusations that seasoned the conversation in their salons.</t1081>
<t1082>—I swear to God that I will tell you the truth —his right hand immediately commanded that divine punishment be prepared—.</t1082> <t1083>I am the son of a well-off family from the Midwest.</t1083> <t1084>All of my relatives have died.</t1084> <t1085>I grew up in America but was educated at Oxford, because, for many years, all my ancestors have been educated there.</t1085> <t1086>It is a family tradition.</t1086>
<t1087>He looked at me out of the corner of his eye, and I understood why Jordan Baker believed that Gatsby was lying.</t1087> <t1088>He hurriedly pronounced the phrase "I was educated at Oxford," or almost swallowed it, or it got stuck in his throat, as if it had already caused him trouble before.</t1088> <t1089>With this doubt, his entire statement fell apart, and I wondered if, after all, there wasn't something sinister about him.</t1089>
<t1090>—Which part of the Midwest? —I asked without much interest.</t1090>
<t1091>—From San Francisco.</t1091>
<t1092>—Okay.</t1092>
<t1093>—My family died and I inherited a good amount of money.</t1093>
<t1094>His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of the clan still weighed heavily on his soul.</t1094> <t1095>For a moment I suspected he was pulling my leg, but a single look at him was enough to convince me otherwise.</t1095>
<t1096>—Then I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe: Paris, Venice, Rome, collecting jewels, mainly rubies, practicing big-game hunting, painting a little, exclusively for myself, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me a long time ago.</t1096>
<t1097>With great difficulty, I managed to contain an incredulous laugh.</t1097> <t1098>Those phrases were so clichéd and so unconvincing that the only image they managed to evoke was that of a puppet with a turban sweating sawdust while chasing a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.</t1098>
<t1099>—Then the war came, comrade.</t1099> <t1100>It was a great relief, and I put all my effort into dying, but it was as if a spell protected my life.</t1100> <t1101>I received the rank of first lieutenant at the beginning of the war.</t1101> <t1102>In the Argonne Forest, I led what was left of my machine gun battalion forward until, on one flank and the other, we cleared a space of about a kilometer through which the infantry could not advance.</t1102> <t1103>We held out there for two days and two nights, one hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis machine guns, and when the infantry finally arrived, they found the insignia of three German divisions among the heaps of dead.</t1103> <t1104>I was promoted to major, and all the allied governments decorated me, even Montenegro, the little Montenegro, on the shores of the Adriatic Sea!</t1104>
<t1105>The little Montenegro!</t1105> <t1106>He emphasized the words and confirmed them with a smile.</t1106> <t1107>The smile took charge of Montenegro's turbulent history and supported the heroic struggles of the Montenegrin people.</t1107> <t1108>He appreciated as a whole the chain of national circumstances that had led to the decoration granted by the small and ardent heart of Montenegro.</t1108> <t1109>My disbelief was overcome by fascination: it was like hastily flipping through a pile of cheap magazines.</t1109>
<t1110>He put his hand in his pocket, and a piece of metal tied to a ribbon fell into my palm.</t1110>
<t1111>—It is the decoration of Montenegro.</t1111>
<t1112>To my astonishment, the medal seemed authentic.</t1112> <t1113>"Order of Danilo," it read in a circle, "Montenegro, Nicholas Rex."</t1113>
<t1114>—Turn it around.</t1114>
<t1115>“Major Jay Gatsby,” I read: “For his extraordinary valor.”</t1115>
<t1116>—There is something else that always accompanies me.</t1116> <t1117>A memory from the days of Oxford.</t1117> <t1118>It was taken in the courtyard of Trinity.</t1118> <t1119>The one who appears to my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.</t1119>
<t1120>It was a photo of a group of young people with the university jacket: they were wasting time under an arcade through which an army of spires could be seen.</t1120> <t1121>There was Gatsby, who looked a little younger, though not much.</t1121> <t1122>He had a cricket bat in his hand.</t1122>
<t1123>So it was all true.</t1123> <t1124>I saw the tiger skins, splendid trophies in his palace on the Grand Canal.</t1124> <t1125>I saw him opening a chest of rubies to soothe the pain of his broken heart in the depths of their crimson glow.</t1125>
<t1126>—I'm going to ask you for a big favor today —he said, while he put his memories back into his pocket with satisfaction—, and that's why I thought you should know something about me.</t1126> <t1127>I didn't want you to think that I'm a nobody.</t1127> <t1128>You see, I usually mingle with strangers because I go from one place to another trying to forget that very sad thing that happened to me once —he hesitated—.</t1128> <t1129>This afternoon you will know what it was.</t1129>
<t1130>—At lunch?</t1130>
<t1131>—No, this afternoon.</t1131> <t1132>I found out by chance that you are having tea with Miss Baker.</t1132>
<t1133>—Do you mean to tell me that you have fallen in love with Miss Baker?</t1133>
<t1134>—No, comrade, no.</t1134> <t1135>But Miss Baker has kindly agreed to talk to you about the matter.</t1135>
<t1136>I had no idea whatsoever about the nature "of the matter," but I felt more annoyed than interested.</t1136> <t1137>I had not invited Jordan for tea to talk about the mysterious Jay Gatsby.</t1137> <t1138>I was sure he was going to ask me for something absolutely fantastic and, for a moment, I regretted ever stepping on his overcrowded lawn.</t1138>
<t1139>He did not speak another word.</t1139> <t1140>His correctness grew as we approached the city.</t1140> <t1141>We passed Port Roosevelt and the sight of its ocean liners painted with a red stripe, and sped through the poor, cobbled streets, flanked by dark bars, still with customers, from the golden and faded early years of the 20th century.</t1141> <t1142>Then the valley of ashes opened to the right and left, and, as we crossed it, for a few seconds I glimpsed Mrs. Wilson, bustling at the gas pump with panting vitality.</t1142>
<t1143>With fenders that stuck out like wings, we splashed light through half of Astoria, only half, because, while we zigzagged between the pillars of the elevated train, I heard the familiar sputtering of a motorcycle, and a frantic policeman was running alongside us.</t1143>
<t1144>—Very well, old sport! —shouted Gatsby.</t1144>
<t1145>We reduced the speed.</t1145> <t1146>He took a white card out of his wallet and waved it in front of the driver's eyes.</t1146>
<t1147>—Everything is in order —admitted the policeman, taking his hand to his cap—.</t1147> <t1148>I will recognize you next time, Mister Gatsby.</t1148> <t1149>Excuse me!</t1149>
<t1150>—What have you shown him? The photo of Oxford?</t1150>
<t1151>—Once I had the chance to do a favor for the chief of police, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.</t1151>
<t1152>On the great bridge, the sunlight flickered endlessly through the beams over the moving cars, and the city rose on the other side of the river in white clusters, in sugar lumps built, as if by a wish, with odorless money.</t1152> <t1153>The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, virgin in its first promise of all the mysterious and wonderful things in the world.</t1153>
<t1154>A dead man passed us in a flower-covered hearse, followed by two carriages with drawn curtains, and by more lively carriages for the friends.</t1154> <t1155>The friends, who had the very thin upper lip typical of southeastern Europe, gave us tragic looks, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was included in their somber procession.</t1155> <t1156>When we were crossing Blackwell’s Island, a limousine driven by a white chauffeur passed us, carrying three very fashionable black people, two boys and a girl.</t1156> <t1157>I laughed out loud when their eyes turned towards us like eggs with proud rivalry.</t1157>
<t1158>"Everything is possible now that we have crossed this bridge," I thought; "absolutely everything."</t1158> <t1159>Even Gatsby was possible, without any particular astonishment.</t1159>
<t1160>Excellent noon.</t1160> <t1161>In a well-ventilated cellar on Forty-second Street, I met Gatsby for lunch.</t1161> <t1162>Blinking to get the street light out of my eyes, I glimpsed him in the anteroom.</t1162> <t1163>He was talking to another man.</t1163>
<t1164>—Mr. Carraway, let me introduce you to my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.</t1164>
<t1165>A small and stocky Jewish man lifted his large head and looked at me with two impressive tufts of hair that grew generously in his nostrils.</t1165> <t1166>It took me a few seconds to discover his little eyes in the semi-darkness.</t1166>
<t1167>—… So I looked at him —said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand vigorously—, and what do you think I did?</t1167>
<t1168>—What? —I asked out of courtesy.</t1168>
<t1169>But it was evident that he wasn't addressing me, because he let go of my hand and pointed at Gatsby with his very expressive nose.</t1169>
<t1170>—I gave the money to Katspaugh and told him, "Alright, Katspaugh, don't pay him a cent until he shuts his mouth."</t1170> <t1171>He shut it immediately.</t1171>
<t1172>Gatsby took us by the arm and led us toward the dining room, and Mr. Wolfshiem, swallowing a phrase he had just begun, remained lost in thought, like a sleepwalker.</t1172>
<t1173>—Whiskey with soda and ice? —asked the maître d'.</t1173>
<t1174>—This restaurant is fine —said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling—.</t1174> <t1175>But I like the one across the street better.</t1175>
<t1176>—Yes, whiskey with soda —Gatsby nodded, and to Mr. Wolfshiem—.</t1176> <t1177>It's too hot in the one across the street.</t1177>
<t1178>—It's hot and small, yes —said Mr. Wolfshiem—, but it's full of memories.</t1178>
<t1179>—What place is this? —I asked.</t1179>
<t1180>—The old Metropole.</t1180>
<t1181>—The old Metropole —repeated Mr. Wolfshiem sadly and pensively—.</t1181> <t1182>Full of dead and disappeared faces.</t1182> <t1183>Full of friends who are gone forever.</t1183> <t1184>I will never forget the night they killed Rosy Rosenthal as long as I live.</t1184> <t1185>There were six of us at the table, and Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot that night.</t1185> <t1186>When it was almost daylight, the waiter approached him with a strange gesture and told him that someone wanted to talk to him outside.</t1186> <t1187>“Very well,” said Rosy, and began to get up.</t1187> <t1188>I forced him to sit down: “Let those sons of bitches come here if they want to see you, Rosy, but don’t you dare leave this room.”</t1188> <t1189>It was four in the morning, and if we had raised the blinds, we would have seen the daylight.</t1189>
<t1190>—And did he leave? —I asked innocently.</t1190>
<t1191>—Of course he went out —Mr. Wolfshiem's nose pointed sharply at me, indignant—.</t1191> <t1192>He turned at the door and said: "Don't let the waiter take my coffee!"</t1192> <t1193>Then he went out to the sidewalk, got shot three times in the belly, and they fled.</t1193>
<t1194>—They electrocuted four —I said, trying to remember.</t1194>
<t1195>—Five, counting Becker —the nostrils flared with interest before me—.</t1195> <t1196>I understand that you are looking for connections for your business.</t1196>
<t1197>The juxtaposition of those two sentences left me perplexed.</t1197> <t1198>Gatsby answered for me.</t1198>
<t1199>—Ah, no —he exclaimed—.</t1199> <t1200>This is not it.</t1200>
<t1201>—No? —Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.</t1201>
<t1202>—He's just a friend.</t1202> <t1203>I already told you that we would talk about that another time.</t1203>
<t1204>—I apologize —said Mr. Wolfshiem—.</t1204> <t1205>I was mistaken.</t1205>
<t1206>A succulent stew arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with a fierce delicacy.</t1206> <t1207>His eyes, meanwhile, slowly scanned the entire place.</t1207> <t1208>And, to complete the arc, he turned to inspect the people behind him.</t1208> <t1209>I believe that, if I hadn't been present, he would have taken a look under the table.</t1209>
<t1210>—Listen, old sport —said Gatsby, leaning towards me—.</t1210> <t1211>I'm afraid I bothered you this morning in the car.</t1211>
<t1212>There was the smile again, but this time I did not give in.</t1212>
<t1213>—I don't like mysteries —I replied—, and I don't understand why you don't speak to me frankly and tell me what you want.</t1213> <t1214>Why does Miss Baker have to tell me?</t1214>
<t1215>—It's nothing shady —he assured me—.</t1215> <t1216>Miss Baker is a great athlete, you know, and she would never do anything wrong.</t1216>
<t1217>Suddenly he looked at the clock, jumped to his feet, and rushed out of the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.</t1217>
<t1218>—He has to make a phone call —said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his gaze—.</t1218> <t1219>A great guy, isn't he?</t1219> <t1220>It's a pleasure to see him and he is a perfect gentleman.</t1220>
<t1221>—Yes.</t1221>
<t1222>—He studied at Oggsford.</t1222>
<t1223>—Ah!</t1223>
<t1224>—He went to Oggsford College, in England.</t1224> <t1225>Do you know Oggsford College?</t1225>
<t1226>—I've heard something.</t1226>
<t1227>—It is one of the most famous colleges in the world.</t1227>
<t1228>—Have you known Gatsby for long? —I asked.</t1228>
<t1229>—Several years —he replied, pleased—.</t1229> <t1230>I had the pleasure of meeting him just after the war ended.</t1230> <t1231>But I knew that I had discovered a man of excellent upbringing after talking to him for an hour.</t1231> <t1232>I said to myself: "This is the kind of man you would happily take home and introduce to your mother and sister" —he paused—.</t1232> <t1233>I see you are looking at my cufflinks.</t1233>
<t1234>I was not looking at the binoculars, but then I looked at them.</t1234> <t1235>They were made with strangely familiar pieces of ivory.</t1235>
<t1236>—The finest specimens of human molars —he informed me.</t1236>
<t1237>—Don't tell me! —I examined them—.</t1237> <t1238>It's a very interesting idea.</t1238>
<t1239>—Yes —he quickly covered the cuffs of his shirt with the sleeves of his jacket—.</t1239> <t1240>Yes, Gatsby is very respectful towards women.</t1240> <t1241>He wouldn't even dare to look at a friend's wife.</t1241>
<t1242>When the one deserving of that instinctive trust returned and sat at the table, Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee in one gulp and stood up.</t1242>
<t1243>—It has been a pleasure eating with you —he said—, but I am going to leave you.</t1243> <t1244>You are young, and I don't want you to consider me a bore.</t1244>
<t1245>—Don't be in a hurry, Meyer —said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.</t1245>
<t1246>Mister Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of blessing.</t1246>
<t1247>—You are very kind, but I belong to another generation —he announced solemnly—.</t1247> <t1248>You stay here and talk about your amusements, your friends, your… —a vague hand gesture replaced an imaginary name—.</t1248> <t1249>As for me, I am fifty years old and I do not want to keep imposing my presence on you.</t1249>
<t1250>When he shook our hand and turned away, his tragic nose was trembling.</t1250> <t1251>I wondered if I had said something that could have offended him.</t1251>
<t1252>—Sometimes he gets very sentimental —Gatsby explained to me—.</t1252> <t1253>Today is one of his sentimental days.</t1253> <t1254>He's quite a character in New York, a neighbor of Broadway.</t1254>
<t1255>—Is he an actor?</t1255>
<t1256>—No.</t1256>
<t1257>—Dentist?</t1257>
<t1258>—Meyer Wolfshiem?</t1258> <t1259>No, he is a gambler —Gatsby hesitated before adding coldly—.</t1259> <t1260>He is the man who fixed the 1919 World Series.</t1260>
<t1261>—Did you rig the final series? —I repeated.</t1261>
<t1262>The idea left me stunned.</t1262> <t1263>I remembered, of course, that in 1919 they rigged the championship, but if I had thought about it, it would have seemed like something that just happened, the final link in an inevitable chain.</t1263> <t1264>It would never have occurred to me that a man could play with the good faith of fifty million people with the determination of a thief cracking a safe.</t1264>
<t1265>—How did you come up with doing something like that? —I asked.</t1265>
<t1266>—The opportunity presented itself.</t1266>
<t1267>—Why isn't he in jail?</t1267>
<t1268>—They can't catch him, buddy.</t1268> <t1269>He's smart.</t1269>
<t1270>I insisted on paying the bill.</t1270> <t1271>When the waiter gave me the change, I discovered Tom Buchanan at the back of the crowded place.</t1271>
<t1272>—Accompany me for a moment —I said—.</t1272> <t1273>I have to greet someone.</t1273>
<t1274>Tom saw us, stood up, and took a few steps towards us.</t1274>
<t1275>—Where have you been? —he asked warmly—.</t1275> <t1276>Daisy is furious because you haven't called us.</t1276>
<t1277>—I present to you Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.</t1277>
<t1278>They shook hands briefly, and Gatsby's face took on an expression of discomfort and tension that I had not seen before.</t1278>
<t1279>—Where have you been? —Tom insisted—.</t1279> <t1280>What made you think of coming to eat so far away?</t1280>
<t1281>—I have come to dine with Mr. Gatsby.</t1281>
<t1282>I turned toward Gatsby, but he was no longer there.</t1282>
<t1283>One day in October of 1917... (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting very straight in a chair at the outdoor café of the Plaza Hotel)... I was taking a walk, on the sidewalk and on the grass.</t1283> <t1284>I liked the grass more because I had some English shoes with rubber studs on the soles that sank into the soft ground.</t1284> <t1285>And I had a new Scottish skirt that lifted a bit in the wind while in all the houses the red, white, and blue flags were stretched out and went tut-tut-tut-tut in a tone of disapproval.</t1285>
<t1286>The largest flag and the largest lawn belonged to Daisy Fay's house.</t1286> <t1287>Daisy had just turned eighteen, two years older than me, and was by far the most sought-after girl in Louisville.</t1287> <t1288>She dressed in white, had a small convertible, and the phone never stopped ringing at her house: the young officers from Camp Taylor[12] eagerly demanded the privilege of monopolizing Daisy that night.</t1288> <t1289>"At least an hour!"</t1289>
<t1290>When I reached the height of her house that morning, the white convertible was next to the curb, and she was sitting at the wheel with a lieutenant whom I had not seen before.</t1290> <t1291>They were so absorbed in each other that Daisy did not see me until I was a meter and a half away.</t1291>
<t1292>—Hello, Jordan —he shouted unexpectedly—.</t1292> <t1293>Come.</t1293>
<t1294>I was flattered that she wanted to talk to me, because out of all the older girls, she was the one I admired the most.</t1294> <t1295>She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross to make bandage packages.</t1295> <t1296>Yes, I was going to the Red Cross.</t1296> <t1297>Well, would I mind notifying them that she couldn't go that day?</t1297> <t1298>The officer was looking at Daisy while she spoke, in a way that any girl would wish to be looked at at least once, and that moment seemed so romantic to me that I haven't forgotten it.</t1298> <t1299>The officer's name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn't lay eyes on him again until four years later.</t1299> <t1300>Even when I ran into him again, in Long Island, I didn't realize it was the same man.</t1300>
<t1301>That was in 1917.</t1301> <t1302>The following year I also had some admirers, and I started participating in tournaments, so I didn't see much of Daisy.</t1302> <t1303>She hung out with a slightly older group, when she went out with anyone.</t1303> <t1304>Wild rumors circulated about her, about how her mother had caught her packing to go to New York to see off a soldier bound overseas.</t1304> <t1305>They absolutely forbade it, but Daisy didn't speak to her family for weeks.</t1305> <t1306>Since then, she didn't flirt with soldiers anymore, only with young men who were nearsighted or flat-footed, unfit for military service.</t1306>
<t1307>By autumn she was cheerful again, more cheerful than ever.</t1307> <t1308>She made her social debut after the armistice, and by February she was engaged to a guy from New Orleans, or so it was said.</t1308> <t1309>In June she married Tom Buchanan, from Chicago, with pomp and solemnity never before seen in the history of Louisville.</t1309> <t1310>The groom arrived with a hundred people in four private cars, and rented an entire floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave the bride a pearl necklace valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</t1310>
<t1311>I was one of the bridesmaids.</t1311> <t1312>I entered Daisy's bedroom half an hour before the gala dinner that preceded the wedding day and found her lying on the bed, beautiful as a June night in her floral dress... and completely drunk.</t1312> <t1313>She had a bottle of Sauternes in one hand and a letter in the other.</t1313>
<t1314>—Congra… Congratulate me —he murmured—.</t1314> <t1315>I had never drunk before, but I love it.</t1315>
<t1316>—What's wrong with you, Daisy?</t1316>
<t1317>I was really scared.</t1317> <t1318>I had never seen a girl like that.</t1318>
<t1319>—Here, take it —he fumbled in a wastebasket he had on the bed and pulled out the pearl necklace—.</t1319> <t1320>Go downstairs and return it to its owner.</t1320> <t1321>Tell everyone that Daisy has changed her mind.</t1321> <t1322>Say: "Daisy has changed her mind!"</t1322>
<t1323>She burst into tears, and cried, cried.</t1323> <t1324>I ran out and found her mother's maid.</t1324> <t1325>We locked the door and bathed her in cold water.</t1325> <t1326>She wouldn't let go of the letter.</t1326> <t1327>She got into the bathtub with it and squeezed it until it turned into a wet ball, and only let me put it in the soap dish when she saw it was turning into snowflakes.</t1327>
<t1328>But she did not speak another word.</t1328> <t1329>We made her smell ammonia, put ice on her forehead, and got her back into the dress, and half an hour later, when we left the bedroom, the pearl necklace was shining on Daisy's neck and the incident was over.</t1329> <t1330>The next day, at five in the afternoon, she married Tom Buchanan without the slightest hesitation and embarked on a three-month trip through the South Seas.</t1330>
<t1331>I saw them in Santa Barbara when they returned, and I thought I had never seen a girl so crazy about her husband.</t1331> <t1332>If Tom left the room for a moment, Daisy would look around nervously and say, "Where has Tom gone?" and she would remain absent-minded until she saw him come back through the door.</t1332> <t1333>She would sit on the sand with Tom's head in her lap for hours, stroking his eyes with her fingers and looking at him with unfathomable pleasure.</t1333> <t1334>It was touching to see them together: it made you silently laugh with fascination.</t1334> <t1335>It was August.</t1335> <t1336>A week after I left Santa Barbara, Tom crashed into a van on the Ventura road one night, and lost one of the front wheels of his car.</t1336> <t1337>The girl who was with him also made the newspapers, because she broke an arm: she was one of the waitresses from the Santa Barbara Hotel.</t1337>
<t1338>In April of the following year, Daisy had a baby girl, and they went to France for a year.</t1338> <t1339>I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, before they returned to Chicago, where they settled down.</t1339> <t1340>Daisy was very successful in Chicago, as you know.</t1340> <t1341>They mingled with a group that liked to have fun, all young, rich, and reckless, but Daisy's reputation remained perfectly intact.</t1341> <t1342>Perhaps because she doesn't drink.</t1342> <t1343>It's a great advantage not to drink among people who drink a lot.</t1343> <t1344>You don't talk too much and at the right moment you can afford some minor indiscretion because everyone is so blind that they either don't notice or don't care.</t1344> <t1345>Maybe Daisy never got involved in affairs... but with that voice she has...</t1345>
<t1346>And, well, about six weeks ago, she heard Gatsby's name for the first time in years.</t1346> <t1347>It was when I asked you in West Egg — do you remember? — if you knew Gatsby.</t1347> <t1348>After you left, Daisy came into my room, woke me up, and said: "Which Gatsby?"</t1348> <t1349>And when I described him — I was half asleep — she said in a very strange voice that it must be the man she knew.</t1349> <t1350>Until that moment, she hadn't connected that Gatsby with the officer in the white convertible.</t1350>
<t1351>When Jordan Baker finished telling me everything, it had been half an hour since we had left the Plaza and were crossing Central Park in a victoria, one of those horse-drawn carriages for tourists.</t1351> <t1352>The sun had sunk behind the movie stars' apartment buildings on the West Fifties streets, and in the heat of the twilight, clear and childlike voices rose, like a gathering of crickets in the grass:</t1352>
<t1353>I am the Sheikh of Arabia.</t1353>
<t1354>Your love belongs to me.</t1354>
<t1355>At night when you sleep</t1355>
<t1356>I will crawl to your tent[13].</t1356>
<t1357>—It has been a curious coincidence.</t1357>
<t1358>—No.</t1358> <t1359>It has not been a coincidence.</t1359>
<t1360>—What do you mean, no?</t1360>
<t1361>—Gatsby bought that house because Daisy lived on the other side of the bay.</t1361>
<t1362>So he was not just sighing for the stars that June night.</t1362> <t1363>And then Gatsby came to life for me: suddenly he emerged from the womb of his futile splendor.</t1363>
<t1364>—He wants to know —Jordan continued— if you would invite Daisy to your house one afternoon so that he could then show up.</t1364>
<t1365>The modesty of the request puzzled me.</t1365> <t1366>He had waited five years and had bought a mansion where he spread starlight among moths that came by chance, just to be able to "show up" one afternoon in a stranger's garden.</t1366>
<t1367>—And did I have to know the whole story before you asked me for something so insignificant?</t1367>
<t1368>—He is scared.</t1368> <t1369>He has waited a long time.</t1369> <t1370>He thought you might get upset.</t1370> <t1371>Deep down, you see, he is not as tough as he seems.</t1371>
<t1372>Something was worrying me.</t1372>
<t1373>—Why doesn't he ask you to set up a date for him?</t1373>
<t1374>—He wants Daisy to see his house —he explained to me—.</t1374> <t1375>And your house is next door.</t1375>
<t1376>—Ah!</t1376>
<t1377>—I think he harbored some hope of seeing Daisy some night at one of his parties —continued Jordan—.</t1377> <t1378>It didn't happen.</t1378> <t1379>Then he started asking people, as if by chance, if they knew her, and I was the first one he came across.</t1379> <t1380>It was the night he called me during the party and you should have heard how convoluted and studied his talk about the matter was.</t1380> <t1381>I immediately suggested, naturally, a lunch in New York, and I thought he was going to lose his nerves: «I don't want to do anything improper!</t1381> <t1382>I want to see her in the house next door».</t1382> <t1383>When I told him you were a close friend of Tom's, he almost gave up the idea.</t1383> <t1384>He doesn't know much about Tom, although he says he's been reading a Chicago newspaper for years just in the hope of seeing Daisy's name.</t1384>
<t1385>It had grown dark and, as we passed under a small bridge, my arm encircled Jordan's golden shoulder, I drew her towards me and invited her to dinner.</t1385> <t1386>I was no longer thinking about Daisy or Gatsby, but about that healthy, difficult, concrete person who professed a universal skepticism, and who leaned back, satisfied, within the circle of my arm.</t1386> <t1387>A phrase began to hammer in my ears in a kind of intoxication: "There are only the pursued and the pursuers, the active and the tired."</t1387>
<t1388>—And Daisy should have something in life —murmured Jordan.</t1388>
<t1389>—Do you want to see Gatsby?</t1389>
<t1390>—She doesn't have to find out.</t1390> <t1391>Gatsby doesn't want her to know anything.</t1391> <t1392>You just have to invite her for tea.</t1392>
<t1393>We left behind a barrier of trees in the twilight and the facades of Fifty-ninth Street, a strip of weak and pale light, shone over the park.</t1393> <t1394>Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I didn't have a girl whose incorporeal features floated in the dark cornices and blinding neon signs, so I drew the girl next to me closer, holding her in my arms.</t1394> <t1395>Her disdainful, sad mouth smiled, so I drew her closer, towards my face this time.</t1395>
<t1396>5</t1396>
<t1397>When I returned to West Egg that night, I feared for a moment that my house was on fire.</t1397> <t1398>It was two o'clock and the tip of the peninsula was glowing with a light that fell unreal over the hedges and produced elongated flashes on the road's electric cables.</t1398> <t1399>As I turned a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby's house, illuminated from the tower to the basement.</t1399>
<t1400>At first, I thought it was another party, a colossal and wild binge that had ended with the guests playing hide and seek all over the house.</t1400> <t1401>But there wasn't a sound.</t1401> <t1402>Only the wind in the trees, the wind that shook the wires and caused the lights to go out and come back on as if the house were blinking in the dark.</t1402> <t1403>As my taxi groaned away, I saw Gatsby approaching across the lawn.</t1403>
<t1404>—Your house looks like the World's Fair —I said.</t1404>
<t1405>—Yes? —he turned to look, as if absent—.</t1405> <t1406>I've been taking a look at some rooms.</t1406> <t1407>Let's go to Caney Island, buddy.</t1407> <t1408>In my car.</t1408>
<t1409>—It's very late.</t1409>
<t1410>—How about we take a dip in the pool?</t1410> <t1411>I haven't used it all summer.</t1411>
<t1412>—I have to go to bed.</t1412>
<t1413>—Very well.</t1413>
<t1414>He waited, looking at me, holding back his impatience.</t1414>
<t1415>—I have spoken with Miss Baker —I said at once—.</t1415> <t1416>Tomorrow I will call Daisy and invite her to tea.</t1416>
<t1417>—Ah, perfect —he said, as if it didn't matter to him—.</t1417> <t1418>I don't want to cause you any trouble.</t1418>
<t1419>—What day works for you?</t1419>
<t1420>—What day works for you? —he immediately corrected me—.</t1420> <t1421>I don't want to cause you any trouble, really.</t1421>
<t1422>—The day after tomorrow?</t1422>
<t1423>He thought about it for a few seconds.</t1423> <t1424>And, not very convinced, he said:</t1424>
<t1425>—We should mow the lawn.</t1425>
<t1426>We looked at the grass: a well-defined line marked where my uneven, neglected lawn ended, and his darker, perfectly maintained one began to spread.</t1426> <t1427>I suspected he was referring to my grass.</t1427>
<t1428>—There is another insignificant thing —he said, unsure, hesitant.</t1428>
<t1429>—Do you prefer that we delay it a few days? —I asked.</t1429>
<t1430>—No, that's not it.</t1430> <t1431>But… —he tried several beginnings—.</t1431> <t1432>Well, I've been thinking…</t1432> <t1433>Yes, look, buddy, you don't make much money, do you?</t1433>
<t1434>—Not much.</t1434>
<t1435>This seemed to calm him down, and he continued with more confidence.</t1435>
<t1436>—It was what I thought, if you can forgive my…</t1436> <t1437>I have, as a complement, a small business, something additional, you know.</t1437> <t1438>And I thought that if you don't earn much…</t1438> <t1439>You sell bonds.</t1439> <t1440>Isn't that right, buddy?</t1440>
<t1441>—I try.</t1441>
<t1442>—Well, this might interest you.</t1442> <t1443>It wouldn't require too much of your time and you could make good money from it.</t1443> <t1444>It's something confidential.</t1444>
<t1445>Now I realize that, under different circumstances, that conversation could have caused one of the crises of my life.</t1445> <t1446>But, since Gatsby made his offer in a rather unsubtle way and without the slightest tact for a service that had yet to be rendered, I had no choice but to cut him off abruptly.</t1446>
<t1447>—I have too much work —I said—.</t1447> <t1448>I appreciate it, but I can't take on more.</t1448>
<t1449>—You wouldn't have to deal with Wolfshiem —he evidently thought that I, scared, was avoiding the "connections" mentioned during lunch, but I assured him he was mistaken.</t1449>
<t1450>He waited a moment, attentive to me starting some conversation, but it was hard for me to react, so absorbed was I, and Gatsby reluctantly went back to his house.</t1450>
<t1451>The afternoon had made me feel irresponsible and happy, and I believe that, as I entered my house, I sank into a deep sleep.</t1451> <t1452>So I don't know if Gatsby did or did not go to Caney Island.</t1452> <t1453>Or how many hours he spent "taking a look at some rooms" while his house gleamed with ostentation.</t1453> <t1454>The next morning I called Daisy from the office and invited her for tea.</t1454>
<t1455>—Don't bring Tom.</t1455>
<t1456>—How?</t1456>
<t1457>—Don't bring Tom.</t1457>
<t1458>"Who is Tom?" she asked innocently.</t1458>
<t1459>The agreed day was pouring rain.</t1459> <t1460>At eleven, a man in a raincoat dragging a lawnmower knocked on the door and told me that Mr. Gatsby had sent him to cut the grass.</t1460> <t1461>That reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finnish maid to come, so I went by car to West Egg Village to look for her, through whitewashed and soaked alleys, and to buy cups, lemons, and flowers.</t1461>
<t1462>The flowers were not necessary, for at two o'clock a genuine greenhouse arrived from Gatsby with countless containers to hold it.</t1462> <t1463>An hour later, the door timidly opened, and Gatsby, in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie, suddenly entered.</t1463> <t1464>He was pale and had shadows under his eyes that indicated a lack of sleep.</t1464>
<t1465>—Is everything alright? —he asked immediately.</t1465>
<t1466>—The grass looks great, if that's what you mean.</t1466>
<t1467>—What grass? —he asked, as if lost—.</t1467> <t1468>Ah, the garden grass —he looked out the window, but, judging by his expression, I don't think he saw anything—.</t1468> <t1469>Yes, excellent —he remarked, distracted—.</t1469> <t1470>I read in a newspaper that it would stop raining around four o'clock.</t1470> <t1471>I think it was the Journal.</t1471> <t1472>Do you have everything you need to prepare…, for tea?</t1472>
<t1473>I took him to the kitchen, where he looked at the Finnish woman with some disdain.</t1473> <t1474>Together we examined the twelve lemon pastries from the delicatessen shop.</t1474>
<t1475>—Do they seem okay to you?</t1475>
<t1476>—Yes, of course! Wonderful! —and he added, though it sounded insincere—… comrade.</t1476>
<t1477>The rain eased off around half past three and turned into a humid mist, in which an occasional tiny drop, like dew, floated.</t1477> <t1478>Gatsby was absentmindedly leafing through a copy of Clay's Economics, startled whenever the Finnish woman's steps made the kitchen floor tremble, and occasionally looked at the fogged-up windows as if a series of invisible but alarming events were happening outside.</t1478> <t1479>He finally stood up and, with an uncertain voice, informed me that he was going home.</t1479>
<t1480>—And why is that?</t1480>
<t1481>—No one will come to have tea.</t1481> <t1482>It's too late! —he looked at the clock as if his time were urgently required elsewhere—.</t1482> <t1483>I can't wait all day.</t1483>
<t1484>—Don't be silly; it's two minutes to four.</t1484>
<t1485>He sat down, dejected, as if he had been pushed, and at that moment the sound of an engine entering the path to my house was heard.</t1485> <t1486>We both jumped to our feet and I, a little anxious as well, went out to the garden.</t1486>
<t1487>Under the bare and dripping lilacs, a large convertible was coming up the road.</t1487> <t1488>It stopped.</t1488> <t1489>Daisy's face, tilted under a lavender tricorn hat, looked at me with an ecstatic and radiant smile.</t1489>
<t1490>—Is this where you live, my love?</t1490>
<t1491>The stimulating whisper of her voice was a very strong tonic in the rain.</t1491> <t1492>I had to follow the melody for a moment, up and down, just with my ear, before catching the words.</t1492> <t1493>A strand of wet hair stuck to her cheek like a blue brushstroke, and her hand was damp with bright droplets when I took it to help her get out of the car.</t1493>
<t1494>—Have you fallen in love with me? —she whispered in my ear—.</t1494> <t1495>If not, why did I have to come alone?</t1495>
<t1496>—That is the secret of Rackrent Castle[14].</t1496> <t1497>Tell the driver to leave and come back in an hour.</t1497>
<t1498>—Come back in an hour, Ferdie —and in a grave murmur—.</t1498> <t1499>His name is Ferdie.</t1499>
<t1500>—Does gasoline affect your nose?</t1500>
<t1501>—I don't think so —he said innocently—.</t1501> <t1502>Why?</t1502>
<t1503>We entered.</t1503> <t1504>To my surprise and confusion, there was no one in the living room.</t1504>
<t1505>—Well, this is really funny.</t1505>
<t1506>—What is funny?</t1506>
<t1507>He turned his head just as some soft and solemn knocks sounded on the door.</t1507> <t1508>I went to open it.</t1508> <t1509>It was Gatsby, pale as death; with his hands sunk like weights in the pockets of his jacket, standing over a puddle of water, he looked tragically into my eyes.</t1509>
<t1510>With his hands still in the pockets of his jacket, he majestically crossed the foyer beside me, suddenly turned as if walking on a tightrope, and disappeared into the living room.</t1510> <t1511>There was nothing graceful about it.</t1511> <t1512>Aware of how my heart was pounding, I closed the door to the increasing rain.</t1512>
<t1513>For a few seconds, not a sound was heard.</t1513> <t1514>Then, from the living room, a sort of muffled murmur reached me, an interrupted laugh, and Daisy's voice, clear and artificial.</t1514>
<t1515>—Of course: I am very happy to see you again.</t1515>
<t1516>A pause; it was dreadfully prolonged.</t1516> <t1517>I had nothing to do in the foyer, so I entered the room.</t1517>
<t1518>Gatsby, with his hands still in his pockets, had leaned against the mantelpiece in a forced imitation of absolute naturalness, even boredom.</t1518> <t1519>His head was thrown back in such a way that it rested on the face of a defunct clock, and from that position, he looked with disturbed eyes at Daisy, frightened but very elegant, sitting on the edge of a chair.</t1519>
<t1520>—We already knew each other —murmured Gatsby.</t1520>
<t1521>He looked at me for a few seconds, and his lips parted in a failed attempt at laughter.</t1521>
<t1522>Luckily, the clock took advantage of that moment to tilt dangerously under the pressure of Gatsby's head, who turned and caught it with trembling fingers to put it back in its place.</t1522> <t1523>Then he sat down, rigid, with his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.</t1523>
<t1524>—I'm sorry about the watch —he said.</t1524>
<t1525>My face was burning as if we were in the tropics.</t1525> <t1526>I wasn't able to find a single cliché out of the thousand I have in my head.</t1526>
<t1527>—It's an old watch —I said stupidly.</t1527>
<t1528>I think that, for a moment, the three of us thought that it had shattered against the ground.</t1528>
<t1529>—It's been many years since we last saw each other —said Daisy, with the most neutral voice possible.</t1529>
<t1530>—Five years next November.</t1530>
<t1531>Gatsby's automatic response paralyzed us for at least another minute.</t1531> <t1532>He had made them get up with the desperate suggestion that they help me prepare the tea in the kitchen when the devilish Finnish woman brought it on a tray.</t1532>
<t1533>Amid the timely confusion of cups and cakes, a certain physical cordiality was established.</t1533> <t1534>Gatsby withdrew into the shade and, while Daisy and I talked, he alternately looked at each of us deeply, with eyes full of tension and unhappiness.</t1534> <t1535>But, since serenity was not an end in itself, I excused myself as soon as I could and stood up.</t1535>
<t1536>—Where are you going? —asked Gatsby, alarmed.</t1536>
<t1537>—I will return.</t1537>
<t1538>—I need to talk to you before you leave.</t1538>
<t1539>He followed me to the kitchen, distraught, closed the door, and murmured completely dejected:</t1539>
<t1540>—My God.</t1540>
<t1541>—What's happening?</t1541>
<t1542>—It has been a terrible mistake —he said, shaking his head—, a terrible, terrible mistake.</t1542>
<t1543>—You feel awkward, that's all —and luckily I added—.</t1543> <t1544>Daisy feels awkward too.</t1544>
<t1545>—Do you feel violent? —he repeated, incredulous.</t1545>
<t1546>—As much as you.</t1546>
<t1547>—Don't speak so loudly.</t1547>
<t1548>—You are acting like a child —I cut in, impatiently—.</t1548> <t1549>Not only that: you are acting like a rude person.</t1549> <t1550>There is Daisy, alone.</t1550>
<t1551>He raised his hand to stop my words, gave me an unforgettable look of reproach, and, opening the door very carefully, went back to the other room.</t1551>
<t1552>I went out through the back door—the same path that Gatsby, nervous, had taken half an hour earlier to go around the house—and ran towards an immense and gnarled black tree whose leafy branches wove a screen against the rain.</t1552> <t1553>It was pouring again, and my uneven lawn, freshly mowed by Gatsby's gardener, was teeming with tiny muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.</t1553> <t1554>There was nothing to look at from the base of the tree except Gatsby's enormous house, so I dedicated myself to looking at it, like Kant at the steeple of his church, for half an hour.</t1554> <t1555>A brewer had built it at the beginning of the "period architecture" fashion, ten years earlier, and it was said that he had committed to paying the taxes of all the neighboring country houses for five years if the owners thatched their roofs.</t1555> <t1556>Perhaps the general rejection dissuaded the brewer from his plan to Found a Family: the decline began immediately.</t1556> <t1557>His children sold the house while the funeral wreath still hung on the door.</t1557> <t1558>Americans, willing to be servants and even eager to be so, have always been reluctant to be country folk.</t1558>
<t1559>Half an hour later, the sun began to shine again, and the grocer's car took the road to Gatsby's house with the raw materials for the servants' dinner: he was sure Gatsby wouldn't eat anything.</t1559> <t1560>A maid began to open the windows on the upper floor of the house, appeared for a moment at each one, and, leaning out of the wide main balcony, spat meditatively into the garden.</t1560> <t1561>It was time to go back.</t1561> <t1562>The rain, while it lasted, seemed like the murmur of Gatsby and Daisy's voices, rising, growing occasionally in bursts of emotion.</t1562> <t1563>But now, in the new silence, I felt that silence had also fallen over the house.</t1563>
<t1564>I entered —after making all the noise possible in the kitchen, short of knocking over the stove—, but I don't think they heard anything.</t1564> <t1565>They were sitting at the two ends of the sofa, looking at each other as if waiting for the answer to a question, or as if a question floated in the air, and all traces of discomfort had disappeared.</t1565> <t1566>Daisy's face was full of tears, and when I entered, she jumped up and started drying them with a handkerchief in front of a mirror.</t1566> <t1567>But in Gatsby, there had been a change that was simply bewildering.</t1567> <t1568>He literally glowed.</t1568> <t1569>Without a word or gesture of joy, he radiated a new well-being that filled the room.</t1569>
<t1570>—Ah, hello, friend —he said, as if he hadn't seen me in years.</t1570>
<t1571>I thought for a moment that he was going to shake my hand.</t1571>
<t1572>—It has stopped raining.</t1572>
<t1573>—Yes? —when he understood what I had just told him, that little bells of sunlight were sparkling in the room, he smiled like a meteorologist, like the ecstatic sponsor of the returning light, and repeated the news to Daisy—.</t1573> <t1574>What do you think?</t1574> <t1575>It has stopped raining.</t1575>
<t1576>—I'm glad, Jay —her throat, filled with a sad and aching beauty, spoke only of her unexpected happiness.</t1576>
<t1577>—I want you to come home with me.</t1577> <t1578>I would like to show it to Daisy.</t1578>
<t1579>—Are you sure you want me to go?</t1579>
<t1580>—Absolutely, comrade.</t1580>
<t1581>Daisy went up to wash her face —and too late I remembered, with humiliation, my towels— while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.</t1581>
<t1582>—My house is nice, right? —he asked me—.</t1582> <t1583>Look at how the light hits the facade.</t1583>
<t1584>I recognized that it was splendid.</t1584>
<t1585>—Yes —he scanned it with his eyes, lingering on the arch of each door, on the solidity of each tower—.</t1585> <t1586>It took me three years to earn the money to buy it.</t1586>
<t1587>—I thought you had inherited your money.</t1587>
<t1588>—And I inherited it, my friend —he said immediately—, but I lost almost everything in the great panic..., the panic of the war.</t1588>
<t1589>I thought he didn't really know what he was saying, because when I asked him what kind of business he was in, he replied, "That's my business," before realizing that it wasn't an appropriate answer.</t1589>
<t1590>—Ah, I have gotten into various things —he corrected—.</t1590> <t1591>I have dedicated myself to the drugstore business and to the oil business.</t1591> <t1592>But I have left both —he looked at me more attentively—.</t1592> <t1593>Do you mean that you have thought about what I proposed to you the other night?</t1593>
<t1594>Before he could answer her, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons shone in the sun.</t1594>
<t1595>—That enormous house over there? —he exclaimed, pointing with his finger.</t1595>
<t1596>—Do you like it?</t1596>
<t1597>—I love it, but I don't know how you can live there completely alone.</t1597>
<t1598>—I always have it full of interesting people, day and night.</t1598> <t1599>People who do interesting things.</t1599> <t1600>Famous people.</t1600>
<t1601>Instead of taking the coastal shortcut, we went down to the road and entered through the large gate.</t1601> <t1602>With charming whispers, Daisy admired this or that aspect of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling scent of the daffodils, the bubbling scent of the hawthorns and the blooming plum trees, and the pale golden scent of the honeysuckle.</t1602> <t1603>It was strange to arrive at the marble staircase and not find a flurry of radiant dresses, coming in and out of the house, and only hear the song of the birds in the trees.</t1603>
<t1604>And inside, as we walked through music rooms à la Marie Antoinette and Restoration-style salons, I had the feeling that there were guests hidden behind every sofa and every table, with orders to keep silent, not even to breathe, until we had passed.</t1604> <t1605>When Gatsby closed the door of the "Merton College Library," I could have sworn I heard the spectral laughter of the man with owl eyes.</t1605>
<t1606>We went up to the second floor, passed through period bedrooms upholstered in pink and lavender silk and enlivened by fresh flowers, and dressing rooms and billiard rooms, and bathrooms with sunken bathtubs, and we appeared uninvited in a room where a man in pajamas, lying down and disheveled, was doing liver exercises.</t1606> <t1607>It was Mr. Klipspringer, the Boarder.</t1607> <t1608>That morning I had seen him wandering anxiously along the beach.</t1608> <t1609>We finally arrived at Gatsby's apartment, a bedroom with a bathroom, and an Adam-style study, where we sat and drank a Chartreuse that he kept in a cupboard.</t1609>
<t1610>He hadn't stopped looking at Daisy for a moment, and I think he recalculated the value of everything in the house based on the reaction it provoked in her beloved eyes.</t1610> <t1611>And sometimes, he looked at his possessions as if dazed, as if in the material and wondrous presence of Daisy, nothing was real anymore.</t1611> <t1612>He almost fell down the stairs.</t1612>
<t1613>His bedroom was the simplest, except for a set of pure matte gold dresser accessories that adorned the dresser.</t1613> <t1614>Daisy picked up the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, at which Gatsby sat down, put his hand to his eyes, and burst out laughing.</t1614>
<t1615>—It's the most fun, buddy —he said, laughing—.</t1615> <t1616>I can't... When I try to...</t1616>
<t1617>He had evidently gone through two states of mind and was reaching a third.</t1617> <t1618>After the discomfort and the irrational joy, he was now consumed by the miracle of Daisy's presence.</t1618> <t1619>He had let himself be absorbed by that idea for a long time, dreaming it from beginning to end while waiting with gritted teeth, so to speak, with an unimaginable degree of intensity.</t1619> <t1620>Now, as a reaction, he was beginning to wind down like an overwound clock.</t1620>
<t1621>He recovered immediately and opened for us two heavy and powerful wardrobes that contained his many suits, dressing gowns, and ties, and his shirts, stacked like bricks by the dozen.</t1621>
<t1622>—I have someone in England responsible for buying my clothes.</t1622> <t1623>They send me a selection of garments at the beginning of the season, in spring and autumn.</t1623>
<t1624>He grabbed a bunch of shirts and started throwing them, one by one, in front of us, shirts of pure linen, thick silk, fine flannel, which unfolded as they fell and covered the table in a multicolored confusion.</t1624> <t1625>While we expressed our admiration, Gatsby kept pulling out shirts and the soft and sumptuous pile kept growing: striped shirts and ones with arabesques and prints in coral, apple green, lavender, and light orange, with monograms in an indigo shade.</t1625> <t1626>Suddenly, amidst muffled sounds, Daisy buried her face in the shirts and began to cry inconsolably.</t1626>
<t1627>—These are such wonderful shirts —she sobbed, and the folds, the fabric, muffled her voice—.</t1627> <t1628>I cry because I had never seen such... such wonderful shirts.</t1628>
<t1629>After the house, we had to see the gardens and the pool, the hydroplane, and the summer flowers, but it started to rain again, so we stayed watching the rippling waters of the sound from Gatsby's window.</t1629>
<t1630>—If there wasn't fog, we would see your house on the other side of the bay —said Gatsby—.</t1630> <t1631>You always have a green light that shines all night at the end of the dock.</t1631>
<t1632>Daisy suddenly took him by the arm, but Gatsby seemed absorbed in what he had just said.</t1632> <t1633>Perhaps he realized that the colossal significance of that light had just vanished forever.</t1633> <t1634>Compared to the immense distance that had separated him from Daisy, the green light seemed very close to her, almost touching her.</t1634> <t1635>It seemed as close as a star is to the moon.</t1635> <t1636>And now it was once again a green light on a dock.</t1636> <t1637>The number of enchanted objects had diminished by one.</t1637>
<t1638>I started to walk around the room, examining things, indistinct in the semi-darkness.</t1638> <t1639>The large photo of an older man dressed for yachting, hanging on the wall above the desk, caught my attention.</t1639>
<t1640>—Who is it?</t1640>
<t1641>—That one? That's mister Dan Cody, buddy.</t1641>
<t1642>The name seemed vaguely familiar to me.</t1642>
<t1643>—He died years ago.</t1643> <t1644>He was my best friend.</t1644>
<t1645>There was a small photo of Gatsby, also dressed for sailing, on top of the desk —Gatsby, defiantly, threw his head back—, from when he must have been about eighteen years old.</t1645>
<t1646>—I love it —exclaimed Daisy—.</t1646> <t1647>The toupee!</t1647> <t1648>You never told me you had a toupee, nor a yacht.</t1648>
<t1649>—Look —Gatsby hurried to say—.</t1649> <t1650>There are a lot of newspaper clippings… about you.</t1650>
<t1651>One next to the other, standing, they began to watch them.</t1651> <t1652>I was going to ask him to show me the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby picked up.</t1652>
<t1653>—Yes…</t1653> <t1654>Alright, but I can't talk right now…</t1654> <t1655>I can't talk, buddy…</t1655> <t1656>I said a small city.</t1656> <t1657>Small…</t1657> <t1658>He knows what a small city is, doesn't he?</t1658> <t1659>If Detroit is a small city to him, it won't work for us…</t1659>
<t1660>He hung up.</t1660>
<t1661>—Come, come, quickly! —shouted Daisy at the window.</t1661>
<t1662>It was still raining, but the shadows had parted to the west, and over the sea there was a pink and gold wave of clouds that looked like foam.</t1662>
<t1663>—Look! —whispered Daisy, and fell silent for a few seconds—.</t1663> <t1664>I would like to catch one of those pink clouds and lift you up and push you.</t1664>
<t1665>I tried to leave then, but they didn't want to hear about it; maybe they felt better alone if I was there.</t1665>
<t1666>—I know what we are going to do —said Gatsby—.</t1666> <t1667>Klipspringer is going to play the piano.</t1667>
<t1668>He left the room shouting "Ewing" and returned a few minutes later accompanied by a somewhat worn-out, dazed young man, with tortoiseshell-framed glasses and thin, blond hair.</t1668> <t1669>At that moment, he was wearing a sports shirt, open at the neck, rubber-soled shoes, and drill trousers of a nebulous color.</t1669>
<t1670>—Have we interrupted your exercises? —asked Daisy, very politely.</t1670>
<t1671>—I was sleeping —mister Klipspringer complained with a shiver of embarrassment—.</t1671> <t1672>That is to say, I had been sleeping.</t1672> <t1673>Then I got up and…</t1673>
<t1674>—Klipspringer plays the piano —said Gatsby, interrupting him—.</t1674> <t1675>Isn't that right, old sport?</t1675>
<t1676>—I don't play it well.</t1676> <t1677>No..., I hardly even know how to play it.</t1677> <t1678>And I haven't played in...</t1678>
<t1679>—Let's go downstairs —Gatsby interrupted him.</t1679>
<t1680>He flipped a switch.</t1680> <t1681>The gray windows disappeared as the house flooded with light.</t1681>
<t1682>In the music room, Gatsby only lit one lamp, next to the piano.</t1682> <t1683>He brought a trembling match to Daisy's cigarette and sat with her on a sofa at the back of the room, where there was no other light except for that which, coming from the lobby, reflected off the shiny floor.</t1683>
<t1684>When Klipspringer played The Love Nest[15], he turned on his stool and, desolate, looked for Gatsby in the dim light.</t1684>
<t1685>—You see, I should practice more.</t1685> <t1686>I had told you that I don't know how to play.</t1686> <t1687>And I should pra…</t1687>
<t1688>—Don't talk so much, buddy —ordered Gatsby—.</t1688> <t1689>Play!</t1689>
<t1690>During the day,</t1690>
<t1691>at night,</t1691>
<t1692>Didn't we have a good time?[16]</t1692>
<t1693>Outside, the wind was blowing strongly and there were very faint thunderclaps in the strait.</t1693> <t1694>In West Egg, all the lights were already on; the electric trains, arriving from New York loaded with people, were rushing home through the rain.</t1694> <t1695>It was the hour when a profound change occurs in humanity and the atmosphere generates tension.</t1695>
<t1696>There is one thing certain, more certain than any other:</t1696>
<t1697>the rich make money and the poor make… children.</t1697>
<t1698>In the idle hours,</t1698>
<t1699>between moments.</t1699>
<t1700>When I went to say goodbye, I saw that the expression of perplexity had returned to Gatsby's face, as if he had just felt a slight doubt about the quality of his present happiness.</t1700> <t1701>Almost five years!</t1701> <t1702>Even that afternoon there must have been a moment when Daisy did not live up to his dreams, not so much because of Daisy herself, but because of the colossal vitality of his own illusion.</t1702> <t1703>His illusion went beyond Daisy, beyond everything.</t1703> <t1704>And to that illusion Gatsby had surrendered with a creative passion, incessantly increasing it, adorning it with any feather he caught on the fly.</t1704> <t1705>There is no fire or cold that can challenge what a man keeps among the ghosts of his heart.</t1705>
<t1706>While I was watching him, he visibly pulled himself together.</t1706> <t1707>His hand took Daisy's, she whispered something in his ear, and at the sound of her voice, Gatsby turned to look at her, moved.</t1707> <t1708>I think it was that voice that most captivated him, with its feverish and vibrant warmth, because it couldn't fit into a dream: that voice was an immortal song.</t1708>
<t1709>They had forgotten about me, but Daisy looked up and waved at me; Gatsby no longer had any awareness of who I was.</t1709> <t1710>I looked at them once more and they returned my gaze, from very far away, possessed by the intensity of life.</t1710> <t1711>Then I left the room and went down the marble steps in the rain, leaving them together.</t1711>
<t1712>6</t1712>
<t1713>At that time, a young and ambitious journalist from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby's door and asked if he had anything to say.</t1713>
<t1714>—Anything to say? About what? —asked Gatsby, very properly.</t1714>
<t1715>—Well, any statement to make.</t1715>
<t1716>It was known after five minutes of confusion that the individual had heard Gatsby's name in the newspaper in connection with something he did not want to reveal or had not fully understood.</t1716> <t1717>It was his day off and he had immediately taken the commendable initiative to come "see."</t1717>
<t1718>He shot at random, but his journalistic instinct was accurate.</t1718> <t1719>The notoriety of Gatsby, spread by the hundreds of people who had accepted his hospitality and thus became specialists on his past, grew throughout the summer to the point where Jay Gatsby was on the verge of becoming news.</t1719> <t1720>Contemporary legends, like that of the "underground conduit to Canada,"[17] linked him to them, and it was persistently said that he did not live in a house, but in a boat that looked like a house and secretly sailed along the coast of Long Island.</t1720> <t1721>Why such inventions were a source of satisfaction for James Gatz, from North Dakota, is not easy to explain.</t1721>
<t1722>James Gatz: that was his real name or, at least, his legal name.</t1722> <t1723>He changed it at the age of seventeen at the exact moment he witnessed the beginning of his career: when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor in the most treacherous shoal of Lake Superior.</t1723> <t1724>It was James Gatz, the boy who was loafing around the beach that afternoon in a torn green sweater and canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a rowboat, approached the Tuolomee, and informed Cody that the wind could catch him and wreck him within half an hour.</t1724>
<t1725>I suppose he had the name prepared for a long time.</t1725> <t1726>His parents were country folk, without ambitions or fortune: his imagination never accepted them as parents.</t1726> <t1727>The truth was that Jay Gatsby, from West Egg, Long Island, emerged from the platonic idea of himself.</t1727> <t1728>He was a son of God —a phrase that, if it means anything, means exactly that—, and he had to take care of his Father's business[18], in the service of an immense, vulgar, and mercenary beauty.</t1728> <t1729>So he invented the type of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy could invent, and he remained faithful to that idea until the end.</t1729>
<t1730>For a year, he traveled along the southern coast of Lake Superior, gathering clams and fishing for salmon, or doing anything else in exchange for food and a bed.</t1730> <t1731>His body, tanned and growing stronger every day, instinctively took advantage of those invigorating days of work, between harshness and indolence.</t1731> <t1732>Very soon, he met women and, since they pampered him, they ended up seeming despicable to him: the young virgins because they knew nothing; the others because they became hysterical over things that he, with overwhelming presumption, took for granted.</t1732>
<t1733>But his heart lived in a constant, turbulent upheaval.</t1733> <t1734>The most grotesque and fantastic ambitions assaulted him at night, in bed.</t1734> <t1735>A universe of unspeakable extravagances developed in his brain while the clock ticked on the sink and the moon bathed the clothes, carelessly thrown on the floor, in a damp light.</t1735> <t1736>Each night the plot of his fantasies grew until drowsiness ended some especially vivid scene with an embrace of forgetfulness.</t1736> <t1737>For a while, these reveries were an outlet for his imagination: they were a satisfying indication of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was firmly founded on a fairy's wing.</t1737>
<t1738>The instinct for future glory had led him months earlier to Saint Olaf, the small Lutheran College, in southern Minnesota.</t1738> <t1739>He endured two weeks, demoralized by the fierce indifference of the place towards the drums of his destiny, towards destiny itself, and hating the janitorial work with which he was going to pay for his stay.</t1739> <t1740>He returned to Lake Superior, and was still looking for something to do the day Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows off the coast.</t1740>
<t1741>Cody was fifty years old then, and he was a product of the silver mines of Nevada, the Yukon, and all the mining booms since 1875.</t1741> <t1742>The copper operations in Montana that made him much more than a multimillionaire found him still strong, physically speaking, but close to intellectual decrepitude, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money.</t1742> <t1743>The not-too-tasteful entanglements with which journalist Ella Kaye played the role of Madame de Maintenon at the expense of Cody's weakness and pushed him to set sail on a yacht were common in the indigestible journalism of 1902.</t1743> <t1744>Cody had been coasting along overly hospitable shores for five years when, in Little Girl Bay, he became the destiny of James Gatz.</t1744>
<t1745>For the young Gatz, who leaned on the oars and looked toward the deck, the yacht represented all the beauty, all the glamour of the world.</t1745> <t1746>I suppose he smiled at Cody: he had probably discovered that when he smiled, people liked him.</t1746> <t1747>The fact is that Cody asked him a few questions (from one of those questions came the new name) and discovered that he was smart and ambitious to the point of extravagance.</t1747> <t1748>A few days later, he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue jacket, six pairs of white drill trousers, and a sailor's cap.</t1748> <t1749>And when the Tuolomee set sail for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast, Gatsby set sail too.</t1749>
<t1750>His role was not precise: while he stayed with Cody, he was successively a waiter, second-in-command, yacht captain, secretary, and even jailer, because, when sober, Dan Cody knew what excesses he was prone to when drunk, and he prevented such contingencies by placing more trust in Gatsby each day.</t1750> <t1751>The arrangement lasted five years, during which the yacht circled the continent three times.</t1751> <t1752>It could have lasted indefinitely, but Ella Kaye came aboard one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody, rather inhospitably, died.</t1752>
<t1753>I remember his portrait in Gatsby's bedroom, a healthy man, with gray hair and a hard, empty expression: the dissipated pioneer who, during a phase of American life, brought back to the East Coast the wild violence of the brothels and slums of the frontier.</t1753> <t1754>It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby hardly drank.</t1754> <t1755>Sometimes, at parties, women would pour champagne on his hair.</t1755> <t1756>He had a habit of not touching alcohol.</t1756>
<t1757>And from Cody he inherited the money: twenty-five thousand dollars that he never received.</t1757> <t1758>He never understood what legal trickery was used against him, but what remained of the millions ended up entirely in the hands of Ella Kaye.</t1758> <t1759>Gatsby was left with his education, so appropriate, so unique: the vague outline of Jay Gatsby took on the substance of a man.</t1759>
<t1760>He told me all this much later, but I write it now with the idea of dispelling those initial absurd rumors about his background, which were not remotely true.</t1760> <t1761>He also told me this at a moment of confusion, when I had come to believe everything and nothing about him.</t1761> <t1762>So I take advantage of this brief interruption, while Gatsby, so to speak, was catching his breath, to dispel all those false ideas.</t1762>
<t1763>There was also an interruption in my relations with him.</t1763> <t1764>For several weeks we stopped seeing each other and talking on the phone —he spent most of the time in New York, hanging out with Jordan and trying to ingratiate himself with her aunt, an old hag—, but I finally went to his house one Sunday afternoon.</t1764> <t1765>I hadn't been there for even two minutes when someone appeared with Tom Buchanan, to have a drink.</t1765> <t1766>I was startled, naturally, though the truly astonishing thing is that it hadn't happened before.</t1766>
<t1767>There were three of them, on horseback: Tom, a certain Sloane, and a very pleasant woman in a brown riding habit, who already knew the house.</t1767>
<t1768>—I am delighted to see you —said Gatsby, standing on the porch—.</t1768> <t1769>I am delighted that you have come.</t1769>
<t1770>As if they cared!</t1770>
<t1771>—Sit down.</t1771> <t1772>Take a cigarette or a cigar —he moved quickly around the room, pressing buzzers—.</t1772> <t1773>The drinks will be ready in a moment.</t1773>
<t1774>The presence of Tom Buchanan affected him deeply.</t1774> <t1775>But he would feel uncomfortable anyway until he served them something, because deep down he realized that was the only reason they had come to his house.</t1775> <t1776>Mister Sloane didn't want anything.</t1776> <t1777>Lemonade? No, thank you.</t1777> <t1778>A little champagne?</t1778> <t1779>Nothing at all, thank you...</t1779> <t1780>I'm sorry.</t1780>
<t1781>—How was the walk?</t1781>
<t1782>—Around here the roads are good.</t1782>
<t1783>—I suppose that automobiles...</t1783>
<t1784>—Yes.</t1784>
<t1785>Obeying an irresistible impulse.</t1785> <t1786>Gatsby turned to Tom, who had reacted to the introduction as if he didn't know him.</t1786>
<t1787>—I believe we already knew each other, Mr. Buchanan.</t1787>
<t1788>—Ah, yes —said Tom, brusque and correct, although it was obvious he didn't remember—.</t1788> <t1789>Yes, I remember perfectly.</t1789>
<t1790>—About two weeks ago.</t1790>
<t1791>—It's true.</t1791> <t1792>You were with Nick.</t1792>
<t1793>—I know his wife —continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.</t1793>
<t1794>—Yes?</t1794>
<t1795>Tom turned towards me.</t1795>
<t1796>—Do you live nearby, Nick?</t1796>
<t1797>—In the house next door.</t1797>
<t1798>—Yes?</t1798>
<t1799>Mister Sloane did not participate in the conversation; instead, he leaned back in his chair arrogantly. The woman also did not speak, until unexpectedly, after two whiskies with soda, she became cordial.</t1799>
<t1800>—We will come to your next party, Mister Gatsby —he suggested—.</t1800> <t1801>What do you say?</t1801>
<t1802>—Alright, it will be a pleasure to have you here.</t1802>
<t1803>—It will be very pleasant —said Mr. Sloane without the slightest gratitude—.</t1803> <t1804>Well, I think we should go home now.</t1804>
<t1805>—Please, there's no rush —said Gatsby warmly.</t1805> <t1806>He had regained control of himself and wanted to keep talking to Tom—.</t1806> <t1807>Why… why don't you stay for dinner?</t1807> <t1808>I wouldn't be surprised if some people from New York dropped by.</t1808>
<t1809>—No.</t1809> <t1810>You are coming to have dinner with me —said the lady enthusiastically—.</t1810> <t1811>Both of you.</t1811>
<t1812>It included me as well.</t1812> <t1813>Mister Sloane stood up.</t1813>
<t1814>—Let's go —he said, but only to her.</t1814>
<t1815>—I'm serious —insisted the lady—.</t1815> <t1816>I would love for you to join us.</t1816> <t1817>There is plenty of room.</t1817>
<t1818>Gatsby looked at me, questioning me.</t1818> <t1819>He wanted to go and had not understood that Mr. Sloane had decided he should not go.</t1819>
<t1820>—I'm afraid I can't accompany you —I said.</t1820>
<t1821>—Well, then you are coming —she insisted, focusing on Gatsby.</t1821>
<t1822>Mister Sloane whispered something in his ear.</t1822>
<t1823>—We won't be late if we leave right now —she replied loudly.</t1823>
<t1824>—I don't have a horse —said Gatsby—.</t1824> <t1825>I rode in the army, but I have never bought a horse.</t1825> <t1826>I will follow you in the car.</t1826> <t1827>Excuse me for a moment.</t1827>
<t1828>The rest of us went out to the porch, where Sloane and the lady stepped aside to start an impassioned conversation.</t1828>
<t1829>—My God, I think that guy is coming —said Tom—.</t1829> <t1830>Doesn't he realize that she doesn't want him to come?</t1830>
<t1831>—She says she wants me to go.</t1831>
<t1832>—He gives a big party where that Gatsby won't know anyone —he frowned—.</t1832> <t1833>I wonder where the hell he met Daisy.</t1833> <t1834>For God's sake, maybe my ideas are out of fashion, but, in my opinion, today's women are too loose.</t1834> <t1835>And they run into all kinds of lunatics.</t1835>
<t1836>Suddenly, Mr. Sloane and the lady came down the stairs and mounted their horses.</t1836>
<t1837>—Let's go —Mr. Sloane said to Tom—, we are late.</t1837> <t1838>We have to leave —and to me—.</t1838> <t1839>Tell him that we couldn't wait, please.</t1839>
<t1840>Tom and I shook hands; with the others, I exchanged a cold nod, and they disappeared at a trot, down the road, among the August foliage, just as Gatsby was coming out the front door with a hat and a light coat in hand.</t1840>
<t1841>It evidently disturbed Tom that Daisy went out alone, and the following Saturday night, he accompanied her to Gatsby's party.</t1841> <t1842>His presence might have given the evening a special sense of oppression: I remember that party among all the ones Gatsby threw that summer.</t1842> <t1843>There were the same people, or at least the same type of people, the same abundance of champagne, the same bustle of voices and colors, but I sensed something unpleasant in the air, a harshness in everything that hadn't existed before.</t1843> <t1844>Or maybe I had simply become accustomed to accepting West Egg as a complete world in itself, with its own rules and its own great figures, not inferior to anything because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was seeing it again, through Daisy's eyes.</t1844> <t1845>It is inevitably sad to look at things with new eyes to which we have already applied our own capacity for focus.</t1845>
<t1846>They arrived at dusk, and, as we walked among hundreds of glowing beings, Daisy's whispering voice played tricks in her throat.</t1846>
<t1847>—These things excite me so much… —she murmured—.</t1847> <t1848>If you want to kiss me during the party, Nick, just tell me and I'll be happy to make it happen.</t1848> <t1849>All you have to do is say my name.</t1849> <t1850>Or present a green card.</t1850> <t1851>I'm going to hand out cards…</t1851>
<t1852>—Look around you —suggested Gatsby.</t1852>
<t1853>—I am looking.</t1853> <t1854>I am having a wonderful time…</t1854>
<t1855>—You will see in person many people you have heard about.</t1855>
<t1856>Tom's arrogant gaze swept over the crowd.</t1856>
<t1857>—We don't go out much —he said—; in fact, I was thinking that I don't know anyone.</t1857>
<t1858>—Perhaps I know that lady —Gatsby pointed to a magnificent orchid-like woman, barely human, sitting with regal dignity under a white plum tree.</t1858>
<t1859>Tom and Daisy looked at her surprised, with that peculiar feeling of unreality that accompanies us when we recognize a movie celebrity, ghostly until that moment.</t1859>
<t1860>—It's beautiful —said Daisy.</t1860>
<t1861>—The man who is now leaning over her is her director.</t1861>
<t1862>Gatsby ceremoniously led them from group to group:</t1862>
<t1863>—Mistress Buchanan… and Mister Buchanan —after hesitating for a few seconds, he added—.</t1863> <t1864>The polo player.</t1864>
<t1865>—No —protested Tom—, not me.</t1865>
<t1866>But it was evident that the sound of those words had pleased Gatsby, and Tom remained "the polo player" all night.</t1866>
<t1867>—I had never seen so many celebrities —exclaimed Daisy—.</t1867> <t1868>That man was nice… What’s his name?</t1868> <t1869>The one with the nose like blue.</t1869>
<t1870>Gatsby told him who he was and added that he was a small producer.</t1870>
<t1871>—Well, I like him anyway.</t1871>
<t1872>—I would almost prefer not to be the polo player —said Tom, content—.</t1872> <t1873>I would like to see all those famous people… incognito.</t1873>
<t1874>Daisy and Gatsby danced.</t1874> <t1875>I remember being surprised by the graceful, conservative way Gatsby danced the fox-trot: I had never seen him dance before.</t1875> <t1876>And then they took a walk to my house and spent half an hour sitting on the steps, while, at Daisy's request, I kept watch in the garden.</t1876> <t1877>«In case of fire or flood,» she explained, «or in case of force majeure».</t1877>
<t1878>Tom came out of his disguise when the three of us sat down to dinner.</t1878>
<t1879>—Do you mind if I have dinner with those people over there? —he said—.</t1879> <t1880>A guy is telling very funny stories.</t1880>
<t1881>—Go ahead, go —replied Daisy, happily—, and if you want to write down any address, here is my gold pencil.</t1881>
<t1882>A moment later, he turned to look at me and said that the girl was "vulgar but pretty," and I realized that, apart from the half hour alone with Gatsby, he was not having a good time.</t1882>
<t1883>We shared a table with an especially drunk group.</t1883> <t1884>It was my fault.</t1884> <t1885>Gatsby had been called on the phone, and I had had a good time with those people just two weeks ago.</t1885> <t1886>But what had amused me then was now poisoned in the air.</t1886>
<t1887>—How are you, Miss Baedeker?</t1887>
<t1888>The girl they were talking to was unsuccessfully trying to lean on my shoulder.</t1888> <t1889>Upon hearing the question, she straightened up and opened her eyes.</t1889>
<t1890>—How?</t1890>
<t1891>A commanding and lethargic woman, who had been asking Daisy to play golf with her the next day at the local club, took up the defense of Miss Baedeker.</t1891>
<t1892>—He's perfectly fine now.</t1892> <t1893>As soon as he has five or six cocktails, he always starts shouting like that.</t1893> <t1894>I've told him he should stop.</t1894>
<t1895>—I have left him —affirmed the accused with a cavernous voice.</t1895>
<t1896>—We heard her scream, so I said to Dr. Civet, who is present here: "There is someone who needs your help, doctor."</t1896>
<t1897>—And she is very grateful to you, I am sure —said another of the friends, without the slightest gratitude—, but you have soaked her entire dress when you dunked her head in the pond.</t1897>
<t1898>—If there is something I can't stand, it's sticking my head in a pond —muttered Miss Baedeker—.</t1898> <t1899>They almost drowned me in New Jersey.</t1899>
<t1900>—You see, you should give it up —replied Dr. Civet.</t1900>
<t1901>—Look who's talking! —Miss Baedeker shouted violently—.</t1901> <t1902>Your hands are shaking!</t1902> <t1903>I would never let you operate on me!</t1903>
<t1904>That's how things were.</t1904> <t1905>Almost the last thing I remember is that I went with Daisy to watch the film director and his star.</t1905> <t1906>They were still under the white plum tree and between their faces, which were touching, there was only a pale and very thin moonbeam.</t1906> <t1907>It occurred to me that the director had been slowly leaning towards the star all night until he reached this proximity, and then, while I was watching them, I saw him descend one last degree and kiss her on the cheek.</t1907>
<t1908>—I like it —said Daisy—.</t1908> <t1909>I think it's beautiful.</t1909>
<t1910>But everything else offended her, and without discussion, because it was not a pose, but a feeling.</t1910> <t1911>She was repulsed by West Egg, that unprecedented "branch" that Broadway had spawned in a Long Island fishing village: she was repulsed by its obscene vigor, which impatiently pushed beneath the old euphemisms, and she was repulsed by the shameless fate that had gathered its inhabitants in that shortcut between nothing and nothing.</t1911> <t1912>She saw something terrible in that simplicity that she could not understand.</t1912>
<t1913>I sat on the entrance steps while they waited for the car.</t1913> <t1914>We were in the dark: only the illuminated door cast a few square meters of light over the dark and soft dawn.</t1914> <t1915>Sometimes a shadow moved behind the blind of one of the upstairs dressing rooms, giving way to another shadow, to an uncertain procession of shadows, who painted their lips and powdered themselves before an invisible mirror.</t1915>
<t1916>—But who is this Gatsby? —Tom suddenly blurted out—.</t1916> <t1917>A big-time bootlegger?</t1917>
<t1918>—Where did you hear that? —I asked.</t1918>
<t1919>—I haven't heard it.</t1919> <t1920>I've imagined it.</t1920> <t1921>Almost all these new rich people are big-time traffickers, you know.</t1921>
<t1922>—Gatsby no —I replied curtly.</t1922>
<t1923>Tom remained silent for a moment.</t1923> <t1924>The gravel on the path crunched under his feet.</t1924>
<t1925>—Well, it must have cost him quite a bit to set up this zoo.</t1925>
<t1926>The breeze stirred the gray mist of Daisy's fur collar.</t1926>
<t1927>—At least they are more interesting than the people we know —he said with effort.</t1927>
<t1928>—You didn't show too much interest —replied Tom.</t1928>
<t1929>—Well, he had it.</t1929>
<t1930>Tom laughed and turned to me.</t1930>
<t1931>—Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to shower her with cold water?</t1931>
<t1932>Daisy began to sing, to accompany the music with a rhythmic and husky whisper, and from each word she extracted a meaning that it had never had and would never have again.</t1932> <t1933>When the melody rose a few tones, her voice broke softly as she followed it, as often happens with contralto voices, and each change spilled a bit of her warm, human magic into the air.</t1933>
<t1934>—A lot of people who haven't been invited are coming —he said suddenly—.</t1934> <t1935>That girl wasn't invited.</t1935> <t1936>They sneak in, and he is too polite to protest.</t1936>
<t1937>—I would like to know who he is and what he does —insisted Tom—.</t1937> <t1938>And I think I'm going to make it my business to find out.</t1938>
<t1939>—I'm telling you right now —replied Daisy—.</t1939> <t1940>He owns several drugstores, many drugstores.</t1940> <t1941>He set them up himself.</t1941>
<t1942>The long-awaited limousine was already coming up the road.</t1942>
<t1943>—Good evening, Nick —said Daisy.</t1943>
<t1944>Her gaze left me to seek the highest point of the illuminated staircase, where Las tres de la mañana[19], a sad, wonderful, and insignificant waltz from that year, was coming out through the open door.</t1944> <t1945>After all, the randomness of Gatsby's parties entailed romantic possibilities completely unknown in her world.</t1945> <t1946>What was in that song that seemed to call her, to ask her to re-enter the house?</t1946> <t1947>What would happen now, in the murky and unpredictable hours?</t1947> <t1948>Perhaps some incredible guest would appear, an infinitely rare person to marvel at, some truly radiant girl, who with a single glance at Gatsby, in a magical and instantaneous encounter, would annihilate those five years of unwavering devotion.</t1948>
<t1949>That night I stayed up very late.</t1949> <t1950>Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free, and I wandered around the garden until the inevitable group of bathers, cold and exhilarated, came running from the dark beach, until the lights in the guest rooms upstairs went out.</t1950> <t1951>When Gatsby finally came down the stairs, his tanned skin was tighter than ever, and his eyes were bright and tired.</t1951>
<t1952>—He didn't like it at all —he said immediately.</t1952>
<t1953>—Of course he liked it.</t1953>
<t1954>—He didn't like it at all —he insisted—.</t1954> <t1955>He didn't have a good time.</t1955>
<t1956>He fell silent, and I imagined his indescribable dismay.</t1956>
<t1957>—I feel very far from her —he said—.</t1957> <t1958>It's hard to make her understand.</t1958>
<t1959>—Are you referring to the dance?</t1959>
<t1960>—The dance? —he dismissed all the dances he had organized with a snap of his fingers—.</t1960> <t1961>Comrade, the dance is not important.</t1961>
<t1962>He wanted nothing less than for Daisy to go to Tom and say, "I never loved you."</t1962> <t1963>When she had erased four years with that phrase, they would decide the most practical steps to take.</t1963> <t1964>One was that, as soon as Daisy was free, they would return to Louisville and get married, leaving from the bride's house, just as if it were five years ago.</t1964>
<t1965>—And she doesn't understand it —said Gatsby—.</t1965> <t1966>She used to understand everything.</t1966> <t1967>We would spend hours and hours...</t1967>
<t1968>He stopped and began to pace up and down a desolate path of fruit peels, denied favors, and crushed flowers.</t1968>
<t1969>—I wouldn't ask too much of her —I dared to say to him—.</t1969> <t1970>We can't repeat the past.</t1970>
<t1971>—Can't we repeat the past? —he exclaimed, incredulous—.</t1971> <t1972>Of course we can!</t1972>
<t1973>He looked everywhere, frantic, as if the past were hiding among the shadows of the house, almost within reach.</t1973>
<t1974>"I am going to return everything to its place, just as it was before," he said, nodding his head very decisively.</t1974> <t1975>Daisy will see it.</t1975>
<t1976>He spoke a lot about the past, and I came to the conclusion that he wanted to recover something, a certain idea of himself, perhaps, that depended on his love for Daisy.</t1976> <t1977>Since then, he had led a confused and disordered life, but if he could go back to the starting point and review everything slowly, he would discover what he was looking for.</t1977>
<t1978>… One autumn night, five years before, they were walking down the street, and the leaves were falling, and they reached a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white in the moonlight.</t1978> <t1979>They stopped there and looked at each other.</t1979> <t1980>It was already cold and the night had that mysterious emotion that is felt during the changes of season.</t1980> <t1981>The silent lights of the houses vibrated in the darkness and there was a tremor, an agitation among the stars.</t1981> <t1982>Out of the corner of his eye, Gatsby saw that the cobblestones of the sidewalk formed a path that rose to a secret place, beyond the treetops.</t1982> <t1983>If he climbed it alone, he would climb it, and once at the top, he could suckle from the udder of life, swallow the incomparable milk of wonder.</t1983>
<t1984>His heart was beating faster and faster as Daisy's pale face came closer to his.</t1984> <t1985>He knew that, when he kissed that girl and forever bound his ineffable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never again soar like the mind of God.</t1985> <t1986>So he waited, and for a few more seconds heard the tuning fork that had just struck a star.</t1986> <t1987>Then he kissed her.</t1987> <t1988>And at the touch of his lips, she blossomed like a flower and the incarnation was complete.</t1988>
<t1989>Everything he said, including his dreadful sentimentality, reminded me of something: an elusive rhythm, a fragment of forgotten words that I had heard somewhere, a long time ago.</t1989> <t1990>A phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips opened like those of a mute, as if something more than a frightened breath of air resisted them.</t1990> <t1991>But they made no sound, and what I had been about to remember became incommunicable forever.</t1991>
<t1992>7</t1992>
<t1993>One Saturday night, when curiosity about Gatsby had reached its peak, the lights of his house did not turn on and, as darkly as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio[20] came to an end.</t1993> <t1994>Only gradually did I realize that the cars that eagerly took the turn into the driveway barely stopped for a moment and then drove away disappointed.</t1994> <t1995>Wondering if he might be ill, I went over to inquire.</t1995> <t1996>A butler with an undesirable face whom I did not know looked at me from the door with a grim and distrustful expression.</t1996>
<t1997>—Is Mr. Gatsby sick?</t1997>
<t1998>—None of that —after a pause, resisting and reluctantly, he added "sir."</t1998>
<t1999>—I don't see him around here, and I was worried.</t1999> <t2000>Tell him that Mr. Carraway has come.</t2000>
<t2001>—Who? —he asked, rudely.</t2001>
<t2002>—Carraway.</t2002>
<t2003>—Carraway.</t2003> <t2004>Very well, I will tell him.</t2004>
<t2005>And without another word, he slammed the door.</t2005>
<t2006>My Finnish woman informed me that Gatsby had fired all the servants in the house a week ago and had replaced them with others, who no longer went to West Egg Village to be bribed by the shopkeepers, but instead made very modest orders by phone.</t2006> <t2007>The grocery store boy said that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the town was that the newcomers were not servants at all.</t2007>
<t2008>The next day Gatsby called me on the phone.</t2008>
<t2009>—Are you leaving? —I asked him.</t2009>
<t2010>—No, comrade.</t2010>
<t2011>—I have been told that you have dismissed the service.</t2011>
<t2012>—I needed people who wouldn't gossip.</t2012> <t2013>Daisy comes very often... in the afternoons.</t2013>
<t2014>So the entire caravanserai had come crashing down like a house of cards due to a disapproving look from Daisy.</t2014>
<t2015>—They are people whom Wolfshiem wanted to help.</t2015> <t2016>They are all brothers and sisters.</t2016> <t2017>They ran a small hotel.</t2017>
<t2018>—Okay.</t2018>
<t2019>Daisy had asked her to call me: could I go to lunch tomorrow at the Buchanans' house?</t2019> <t2020>Miss Baker would also be there.</t2020> <t2021>Half an hour later, Daisy herself called me and seemed relieved when she found out I would go.</t2021> <t2022>Something was going to happen, and yet, I didn't think they would choose that occasion to create a scene: especially the horrible scene that Gatsby had rehearsed in the garden.</t2022>
<t2023>The next day was scorching, almost the last of summer and undoubtedly the hottest.</t2023> <t2024>When my train emerged from the tunnel, into the sunlight, only the warm siren of the National Biscuit Company broke the boiling silence of noon.</t2024> <t2025>The seats of the train were nearing the ignition point; the woman next to me delicately stained her white blouse with sweat and then, when the newspaper became damp at the touch of her fingers, she surrendered to the unbearable heat with despair and a desolate moan.</t2025> <t2026>Her purse fell to the floor.</t2026>
<t2027>—My God! —he sighed.</t2027>
<t2028>I picked it up with a tired inclination and returned it to him, holding it by a corner, by the tip, and extending my arm to make it clear that my gesture did not hide any ulterior motives, but everyone nearby, including the woman, suspected the same of me.</t2028>
<t2029>—What heat! —said the conductor in front of the faces that seemed familiar to him—.</t2029> <t2030>What weather!</t2030> <t2031>What heat, what heat.</t2031> <t2032>Do you think it's not much? Aren't you hot?</t2032>
<t2033>He returned the train voucher to me with a dark stain that his hand had left.</t2033> <t2034>How could anyone care, in such heat, whose feverish lips they kissed, or whose head dampened the pocket of their pajamas, over their heart?</t2034>
<t2035>But in the vestibule of the Buchanan house, a gentle breeze blew, carrying the sound of the telephone to the door where Gatsby and I were waiting.</t2035>
<t2036>—The master's corpse! —roared the butler into the device—.</t2036> <t2037>I'm sorry, madam, but we cannot deliver it to you.</t2037> <t2038>It's too hot to touch it at midday!</t2038>
<t2039>What he really said was:</t2039>
<t2040>—Yes. Yes.</t2040> <t2041>I'm going to see.</t2041>
<t2042>He hung up and approached us, shining with sweat, to take our straw hats.</t2042>
<t2043>—Madame is waiting for you in the living room! —she shouted and, unnecessarily, pointed the way for us.</t2043>
<t2044>With that heat, every superfluous gesture was an offense against the normal reserves of life.</t2044>
<t2045>The room, in the shade of the awnings, was dark and cool.</t2045> <t2046>Daisy and Jordan were lying on a huge sofa, like silver idols whose weight held down their white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.</t2046>
<t2047>—We can't move —they said in unison.</t2047>
<t2048>Jordan's fingers, with whitening powders over the tan, rested for a moment on mine.</t2048>
<t2049>—And Mr. Tom Buchanan, the athlete? —I asked.</t2049>
<t2050>Simultaneously I heard Tom's voice, grumpy, muffled, hoarse, on the lobby phone.</t2050>
<t2051>Gatsby, standing in the center of the crimson carpet, looked at everything with fascinated eyes.</t2051> <t2052>Daisy, watching him, laughed with her sweet and exciting laugh: a tiny puff of pink powder rose from her chest.</t2052>
<t2053>—There's a rumor —murmured Jordan— that the one on the phone is Tom's girl.</t2053>
<t2054>We remained silent.</t2054> <t2055>The voice from the lobby rose irritably:</t2055>
<t2056>—Very well, then.</t2056> <t2057>I am not selling you the car, in any way...</t2057> <t2058>I have no commitment to you...</t2058> <t2059>And I do not tolerate, in any way, being disturbed during my meal!</t2059>
<t2060>—You have the phone microphone covered —said Daisy cynically.</t2060>
<t2061>—No —I assured him—.</t2061> <t2062>He is genuinely negotiating.</t2062> <t2063>I know the matter.</t2063>
<t2064>Tom suddenly opened the door, blocked it for a few seconds with his ample body, and rushed into the room.</t2064>
<t2065>—Mr. Gatsby! —he extended his hand, broad and open, with well-disguised annoyance—.</t2065> <t2066>I'm glad to see you… Nick…</t2066>
<t2067>"Prepare us something cold to drink," ordered Daisy.</t2067>
<t2068>She stood up when Tom left the room, approached Gatsby, made him tilt his head, and kissed him on the mouth.</t2068>
<t2069>—You know I love you —he murmured.</t2069>
<t2070>—You forget that there is a lady present —said Jordan.</t2070>
<t2071>Daisy looked around, hesitant.</t2071>
<t2072>—You kiss Nick.</t2072>
<t2073>—What a rude and vulgar girl!</t2073>
<t2074>—I don't care! —shouted Daisy and started to dance on the chimney bricks.</t2074>
<t2075>Then he remembered the heat and sat on the sofa with a guilty look just as a very clean and freshly ironed nanny entered the room with a little girl.</t2075>
<t2076>—Bless-ed pre-cious-ness! —hummed Daisy, extending her arms—.</t2076> <t2077>Come to your mother who adores you.</t2077>
<t2078>The girl, free from the nanny, ran across the room and timidly grabbed her mother's dress.</t2078>
<t2079>—My blessed precious one!</t2079> <t2080>Did mommy fill your precious blonde hair with powder?</t2080> <t2081>Stand up straight and say: How are you?</t2081>
<t2082>Gatsby and I leaned down to take the tiny and reluctant hand.</t2082> <t2083>Then Gatsby continued to look at the child with surprise.</t2083> <t2084>I think that until then he had not truly believed in her existence.</t2084>
<t2085>—I dressed up for the meal —said the girl, turning towards Daisy with impatience.</t2085>
<t2086>—Because your mother wanted to show you off —Daisy's face moved closer to the only wrinkle on the small white collar—.</t2086> <t2087>You are a dream, you are a very small dream.</t2087>
<t2088>—Yes —admitted the girl, calmly—.</t2088> <t2089>Aunt Jordan is also wearing a white dress.</t2089>
<t2090>—What do you think of mom's friends?</t2090> <t2091>—Daisy turned her around to look at Gatsby—.</t2091> <t2092>Do you think they are handsome?</t2092>
<t2093>—Where is dad?</t2093>
<t2094>—He doesn't look like his father —explained Daisy—.</t2094> <t2095>He looks like me.</t2095> <t2096>He has my hair and the shape of my face.</t2096>
<t2097>Daisy climbed onto the sofa.</t2097> <t2098>The nanny took a step and reached out her hand towards the girl.</t2098>
<t2099>—Let's go, Pammy.</t2099>
<t2100>—Goodbye, treasure!</t2100>
<t2101>Turning to look, the girl, reluctant, very well-mannered, took the nanny's hand, who led her away, just as Tom returned with four gin and sodas with lime juice, clinking with ice.</t2101>
<t2102>Gatsby picked up his glass.</t2102>
<t2103>—They seem really cold —he said, visibly tense.</t2103>
<t2104>We gave long and eager speeches.</t2104>
<t2105>—I read somewhere that the sun gets hotter every year —said Tom, very amiably—.</t2105> <t2106>It seems that very soon the earth will fall into the sun, or, wait a moment, no, it's exactly the opposite: the sun gets cooler every year.</t2106> <t2107>Come on —he suggested to Gatsby—.</t2107> <t2108>I would like you to see the house.</t2108>
<t2109>I went out with them to the gallery.</t2109> <t2110>Over the narrow, green, heat-stagnant strait, a tiny sail was gliding very slowly towards cooler waters.</t2110> <t2111>Gatsby's eyes followed it for a moment; he raised his hand and pointed to the other shore of the bay.</t2111>
<t2112>—I live exactly in front of your house.</t2112>
<t2113>—Okay.</t2113>
<t2114>We looked beyond the rose bushes, the warm lawn, and the algae debris left along the coast on the stifling days.</t2114> <t2115>The wings of the ship moved slowly against the cold blue edge of the sky.</t2115> <t2116>Before us stretched the undulating ocean and the blessed and abundant islands.</t2116>
<t2117>—Now that's a sport —said Tom, nodding his head—.</t2117> <t2118>I would like to spend an hour on that boat.</t2118>
<t2119>We had lunch in the dining room, in the shade, against the heat, and drank nervous joy with the cold beer.</t2119>
<t2120>—What are we going to do this afternoon? —exclaimed Daisy—.</t2120> <t2121>And tomorrow, and in the next thirty years?[21]</t2121>
<t2122>—Don't be morbid —said Jordan—.</t2122> <t2123>Life starts over when it gets cool in the fall.</t2123>
<t2124>—But it's so hot —insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears— and everything is so confusing…</t2124> <t2125>Let's go to the city!</t2125>
<t2126>His voice struggled and crashed against the heat, giving shape to the senselessness of that climate.</t2126>
<t2127>—I have heard of stables being turned into garages —Tom was saying to Gatsby—, but I am the first to have turned a garage into a stable.</t2127>
<t2128>—Who wants to go to the city?</t2128> <t2129>—asked Daisy insistently.</t2129> <t2130>Gatsby's gaze flew towards her—.</t2130> <t2131>Ah —exclaimed Daisy—, it seems you're not hot.</t2131>
<t2132>Their eyes met and they looked at each other, alone in the space.</t2132> <t2133>With effort, Daisy lowered her gaze to the table.</t2133>
<t2134>—It seems like you're never hot —he repeated.</t2134>
<t2135>She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw it.</t2135> <t2136>He was astonished.</t2136> <t2137>His mouth fell open slightly, and he looked at Gatsby, and then at Daisy, as if he had just recognized an old friend.</t2137>
<t2138>—You look like the man from the ad —Daisy continued innocently—.</t2138> <t2139>You know, the ad with the man…</t2139>
<t2140>—Very well —Tom interrupted her immediately—.</t2140> <t2141>I am willing to go to the city, of course.</t2141> <t2142>Come on, we are all going to the city.</t2142>
<t2143>He stood up, and his eyes flashed between Gatsby and his wife.</t2143> <t2144>Nobody moved.</t2144>
<t2145>—Come on! —he was starting to lose his patience—.</t2145> <t2146>What is it now?</t2146> <t2147>If we're going to the city, let's get moving!</t2147>
<t2148>The hand, trembling from the effort of self-control, brought the remnants of the beer glass to his lips.</t2148> <t2149>Daisy's voice forced us to get up and step out onto the incandescent gravel path.</t2149>
<t2150>"Are we leaving already?" he objected.</t2150> <t2151>"Like this? Can't we at least smoke a cigarette first?"</t2151>
<t2152>—Everyone smoked during the meal.</t2152>
<t2153>—Oh, let's have fun —implored Daisy—.</t2153> <t2154>It's too hot to fight.</t2154>
<t2155>Tom did not respond.</t2155>
<t2156>—Whatever you say —said Daisy—.</t2156> <t2157>Let's go, Jordan.</t2157>
<t2158>They went up to get ready while the three of us men dragged our feet over the hot stones.</t2158> <t2159>The silver curve of the moon was already floating in the sky, to the west.</t2159> <t2160>Gatsby went to speak and changed his mind, but not before Tom turned to look at him, expectant.</t2160>
<t2161>—Do you have the stables here? —asked Gatsby, making an effort.</t2161>
<t2162>—About four hundred meters down the road.</t2162>
<t2163>—Ah.</t2163>
<t2164>Pause.</t2164>
<t2165>—I don't understand the idea of going to the city —Tom burst out, fiercely—.</t2165> <t2166>Women have some crazy ideas…</t2166>
<t2167>—Shall we bring something to drink? —asked Daisy from an upstairs window.</t2167>
<t2168>—I'm going to get whisky —replied Tom.</t2168>
<t2169>He entered the house.</t2169>
<t2170>Gatsby turned towards me, rigid.</t2170>
<t2171>—I can't speak in the husband's house, comrade.</t2171>
<t2172>—Daisy has an indiscreet voice —I pointed out—.</t2172> <t2173>It's full of… —I hesitated.</t2173>
<t2174>—It's a voice full of money —said Gatsby suddenly.</t2174>
<t2175>That's how it was.</t2175> <t2176>I hadn't understood it until then.</t2176> <t2177>Full of money: that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in that voice, its jingling, its song of cymbals and bells…</t2177> <t2178>At the summit of a white palace, the king's daughter, the golden girl…</t2178>
<t2179>Tom left the house with a bottle wrapped in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan, who had put on little hats made of a metallic fabric and were carrying light capes on their arms.</t2179>
<t2180>—Shall we all go in my car? —suggested Gatsby.</t2180> <t2181>He felt the very hot green leather seat—.</t2181> <t2182>I should have left it in the shade.</t2182>
<t2183>—Is the gear shifting normal? —asked Tom.</t2183>
<t2184>—Yes.</t2184>
<t2185>—Then take my coupe and let me drive your car to the city.</t2185>
<t2186>Gatsby did not like the suggestion.</t2186>
<t2187>—I think it doesn't have enough gasoline.</t2187>
<t2188>—There's plenty —said Tom, impetuously.</t2188> <t2189>He looked at the gauge—.</t2189> <t2190>And if it runs out, I can stop at a drugstore.</t2190> <t2191>These days you can buy anything at a drugstore.</t2191>
<t2192>A silence followed this remark, seemingly without any ulterior motives.</t2192> <t2193>Daisy looked at Tom with furrowed brows, and an indefinable expression, at once irremediably strange and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard the words that described it, passed over Gatsby's face.</t2193>
<t2194>—Let's go, Daisy —said Tom, pushing her towards Gatsby's car—.</t2194> <t2195>I'll take you in this circus wagon.</t2195>
<t2196>He opened the door, but Daisy dodged the circle of his arm.</t2196>
<t2197>—Take Nick and Jordan.</t2197> <t2198>We will follow you in the coupe.</t2198>
<t2199>He approached Gatsby and touched his jacket.</t2199> <t2200>Jordan, Tom, and I sat in Gatsby's car, all three of us in the front.</t2200> <t2201>Tom fumbled with the unfamiliar clutch and gear shift, and we shot off into the oppressive heat, losing sight of those left behind.</t2201>
<t2202>—Have you noticed? —asked Tom.</t2202>
<t2203>—In what?</t2203>
<t2204>He looked at me intently, realizing that Jordan and I knew everything.</t2204>
<t2205>—You think I'm an idiot, don't you? —he suggested—.</t2205> <t2206>Maybe I am, but I have...</t2206> <t2207>Sometimes I have a special instinct that tells me what I should do.</t2207> <t2208>You might not believe it, but science...</t2208>
<t2209>He fell silent.</t2209> <t2210>The immediate emergency situation imposed itself on him, pulling him away from the edge of the theoretical abyss.</t2210>
<t2211>—I did a little research on that guy —he continued—.</t2211> <t2212>And, if I had known, I would have delved deeper.</t2212>
<t2213>—Do you mean you've been to a medium? —Jordan asked jokingly.</t2213>
<t2214>—What? —he looked at us confused while we laughed—.</t2214> <t2215>A medium?</t2215>
<t2216>—To ask him about Gatsby.</t2216>
<t2217>—Gatsby! No, I haven't gone.</t2217> <t2218>I said that I did a little research on his past.</t2218>
<t2219>—And you discovered that he studied at Oxford —said Jordan, contributing.</t2219>
<t2220>—Oxford! —he exclaimed, incredulous—.</t2220> <t2221>What nonsense! And he's wearing a pink suit!</t2221>
<t2222>—But he has studied at Oxford.</t2222>
<t2223>—In Oxford, New Mexico —Tom let out a snort of disdain—, or somewhere like that.</t2223>
<t2224>—Tell me, Tom.</t2224> <t2225>If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch? —asked Jordan moodily.</t2225>
<t2226>—Daisy invited him: she knew him before we got married.</t2226> <t2227>God knows where!</t2227>
<t2228>Now the three of us were irritable because the effects of the beer were wearing off and, realizing this, we traveled in silence for a while.</t2228> <t2229>When the faded eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg appeared at the end of the road, I remembered Gatsby's warning about the gasoline.</t2229>
<t2230>—We have enough to reach the city —said Tom.</t2230>
<t2231>—But there is a service station right there —objected Jordan—.</t2231> <t2232>I don't want to stay stuck in this oven.</t2232>
<t2233>Tom, impatient, used both brakes at once and we skidded to a dusty, barren corner under the sign that read Wilson.</t2233> <t2234>After a few seconds, the owner emerged from inside the garage and gave the car a blank stare.</t2234>
<t2235>—Gasoline! —Tom shouted, brutally—.</t2235> <t2236>What do you think we stopped for?</t2236> <t2237>To admire the scenery?</t2237>
<t2238>—I am sick —said Wilson without moving—.</t2238> <t2239>I've been sick all day.</t2239>
<t2240>—What's wrong with him?</t2240>
<t2241>—I am exhausted.</t2241>
<t2242>—Well, shall I help myself? —asked Tom—.</t2242> <t2243>Over the phone, he seemed perfectly fine.</t2243>
<t2244>Wilson, with effort, left the shadow and support of the door and, breathing with difficulty, removed the cap from the tank.</t2244> <t2245>In the sunlight, his face was green.</t2245>
<t2246>—It was not my intention to bother you during lunch —he said—.</t2246> <t2247>But I need money quickly and wanted to know what you plan to do with your old car.</t2247>
<t2248>—Do you like this one? —asked Tom—.</t2248> <t2249>I bought it last week.</t2249>
<t2250>—It's great, yellow —said Wilson, as he busied himself with the pump handle.</t2250>
<t2251>—Do you want to buy it?</t2251>
<t2252>—It's too much —Wilson smiled weakly—.</t2252> <t2253>No, but I could get some money out of the other one.</t2253>
<t2254>—And why do you need money so urgently?</t2254>
<t2255>—I've been here too long.</t2255> <t2256>I want to leave.</t2256> <t2257>My wife and I want to go to the West.</t2257>
<t2258>—His wife wants to leave —exclaimed Tom, very surprised.</t2258>
<t2259>—He has been talking about that for ten years —he leaned on the pump for a moment, shielding his eyes from the sun—.</t2259> <t2260>And now he is going to leave whether he wants to or not.</t2260> <t2261>I'm planning to take her with me.</t2261>
<t2262>The coupe sped past us with a whirlwind of dust and the glint of a waving hand.</t2262>
<t2263>—How much do I owe you? —asked Tom in an unpleasant voice.</t2263>
<t2264>—I have noticed something strange these past few days —pointed out Wilson—.</t2264> <t2265>That's why I want to leave.</t2265> <t2266>And that's why I bothered you about the car.</t2266>
<t2267>—How much do I owe you?</t2267>
<t2268>—One dollar twenty.</t2268>
<t2269>The relentless heat began to daze me, and I felt unwell for a few seconds until I realized that Wilson did not suspect Tom.</t2269> <t2270>He had discovered that Myrtle was leading some kind of life outside of their marriage, in another world, and the shock had made him physically ill.</t2270> <t2271>I looked at Wilson and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery an hour earlier, and it occurred to me that there is no difference between men, neither in intelligence nor in race, as profound as the difference between the sick and the healthy.</t2271> <t2272>Wilson was so sick that he seemed guilty, unforgivably guilty, as if he had just gotten a poor girl pregnant.</t2272>
<t2273>—I will sell him the car —said Tom—.</t2273> <t2274>I will send it to him tomorrow afternoon.</t2274>
<t2275>That place always had something unsettling, even in the clear light of the afternoon, and I turned my head as if I had been warned that something was lurking behind me.</t2275> <t2276>Over the heaps of ash, the gigantic eyes of Doctor T. J.</t2276> <t2277>Eckleburg remained vigilant, but after a moment, I realized that other eyes were watching us with special intensity from less than six meters away.</t2277>
<t2278>In one of the windows on the upper floor of the garage, the curtains had moved, parting slightly, and Myrtle Wilson was looking towards the car.</t2278> <t2279>She was so absorbed that she was unaware she was being watched, and one emotion after another appeared on her face like objects in a photo that slowly develops.</t2279> <t2280>Her expression was curiously familiar: it was an expression I had seen many times on women's faces, but on Myrtle's face, it seemed gratuitous and inexplicable until I discovered that her eyes, wide open with the terror of jealousy, were not fixed on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she had mistaken for his wife.</t2280>
<t2281>There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away, Tom felt the lashes of panic.</t2281> <t2282>His wife and his lover, secure and unblemished until an hour ago, were precipitously escaping his control.</t2282> <t2283>Instinct drove him to press the accelerator with the dual purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped towards Astoria at eighty kilometers per hour until, between the spider-leg-like pillars of the elevated train, we saw the blue coupe leisurely driving along.</t2283>
<t2284>—The big theaters on Fifty Street are air-conditioned —suggested Jordan—.</t2284> <t2285>I love New York in the summer afternoons when there's no one around.</t2285> <t2286>They have something very sensual, like ripe fruit, as if all kinds of exotic fruits were about to fall into our hands.</t2286>
<t2287>The word "sensual" had the effect of unsettling Tom even more, but before he could come up with a protest, the coupe stopped, and Daisy signaled us to stop beside her.</t2287>
<t2288>—Where are we going? —he shouted.</t2288>
<t2289>—Shall we go into a movie theater?</t2289>
<t2290>—It's too hot —complained Daisy—.</t2290> <t2291>You all go ahead.</t2291> <t2292>We'll take a walk and then we'll see you —with an effort, her wit lifted slightly—.</t2292> <t2293>We'll meet at any corner.</t2293> <t2294>I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.</t2294>
<t2295>—We can't talk about it here —said Tom impatiently, and at that moment, behind us, a truck honked angrily—.</t2295> <t2296>Follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.</t2296>
<t2297>Several times Tom turned to look at his car, and when the traffic forced them to fall behind, he slowed down until he could see them again.</t2297> <t2298>I think he feared they would take a side street and disappear from his life forever.</t2298>
<t2299>But they didn't do it.</t2299> <t2300>And we all ended up taking a much less explainable step: we rented the lounge of a suite at the Plaza Hotel.</t2300>
<t2301>I have forgotten the long and tumultuous discussion that ended up bringing us together in that room, although I retain a physical and clear memory that, during the course of the debate, my underwear kept insisting on climbing up my legs like a snake and that cold drops of sweat intermittently ran down my back.</t2301> <t2302>The idea was born from Daisy's suggestion that we rent five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then it took the more tangible form of "finding a place to drink a mint julep."</t2302> <t2303>We all repeated and repeated that it was "nonsense," and we all talked at the same time to a perplexed concierge and thought, or pretended to think, that we were very funny...</t2303>
<t2304>In the room, which was very spacious, it was unbearably hot and, although it was already four o'clock, when the windows were opened, barely a warm breeze from the park's trees came in.</t2304> <t2305>Daisy approached the mirror and, with her back to us, fixed her hair.</t2305>
<t2306>—It's a very chic suite —Jordan murmured very seriously, and we all laughed.</t2306>
<t2307>—Open another window —ordered Daisy, without turning around.</t2307>
<t2308>—There is no more.</t2308>
<t2309>—Very well, then we will order an axe by phone.</t2309>
<t2310>—What you need to do is forget about the heat —said Tom impatiently—.</t2310> <t2311>You multiply it by ten by complaining.</t2311>
<t2312>He unwrapped the bottle of whisky from the towel and placed it on the table.</t2312>
<t2313>—Why don't you leave Daisy alone, buddy?</t2313> <t2314>You are the one who wanted to come to the city.</t2314>
<t2315>There was a moment of silence.</t2315> <t2316>The phone book came off the nail and crashed to the floor, and Jordan murmured "Forgive me," but this time no one laughed.</t2316>
<t2317>—I'm going to get it —I offered.</t2317>
<t2318>—I've got it now —Gatsby examined the broken string, let out an interrogative "Hmm" and placed it on a chair.</t2318>
<t2319>—That's one of his great expressions, isn't it? —said Tom, sharply.</t2319>
<t2320>—Which one?</t2320>
<t2321>—That "comrade" thing.</t2321> <t2322>Where did you get it from?</t2322>
<t2323>—Pay attention to me, Tom —said Daisy, stopping looking at herself in the mirror—, if you're going to make personal remarks, I won't stay here for even a minute.</t2323> <t2324>Call and ask for ice for the mint julep.</t2324>
<t2325>When Tom picked up the receiver, the compressed heat burst into sounds, and we heard the mighty chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March coming from downstairs, from the ballroom.</t2325>
<t2326>—Imagine getting married in this heat —said Jordan in a somber tone.</t2326>
<t2327>—Hush, I got married in the middle of June —recalled Daisy—.</t2327> <t2328>Louisville in June!</t2328> <t2329>Someone fainted.</t2329> <t2330>Who fainted, Tom?</t2330>
<t2331>—Biloxi —he responded, curtly.</t2331>
<t2332>—One who was called Biloxi, "Blocks" Biloxi, a box manufacturer (this is authentic), and he was from Biloxi, in Tennessee.</t2332>
<t2333>—They took him to my house —said Jordan— because we lived two steps away from the church.</t2333> <t2334>And he stayed for three weeks, until my father told him to leave.</t2334> <t2335>The next day my father died —after a few seconds he added—.</t2335> <t2336>There is no relation between the two events.</t2336>
<t2337>—I knew a certain Bill Biloxi, from Memphis —I pointed out.</t2337>
<t2338>—He was her cousin.</t2338> <t2339>He told me the whole family history before leaving.</t2339> <t2340>He gave me an aluminum putter that I still use.</t2340>
<t2341>The music had died down when the ceremony began, and at that moment a long ovation reached us through the window, followed by intermittent shouts of "Yes, Yes, Yes," and finally, an explosion of jazz that marked the beginning of the dance.</t2341>
<t2342>—We are getting old —said Daisy—.</t2342> <t2343>If we were young, we would get up and start dancing.</t2343>
<t2344>—Remember Biloxi —Jordan warned her—.</t2344> <t2345>Where did you meet him, Tom?</t2345>
<t2346>—Biloxi? —he made an effort to concentrate—.</t2346> <t2347>I didn't know him.</t2347> <t2348>He was a friend of Daisy's.</t2348>
<t2349>—No —said Daisy—.</t2349> <t2350>I had never seen him in my life.</t2350> <t2351>He arrived in one of the rented carriages.</t2351>
<t2352>—Well, he said he knew you.</t2352> <t2353>He said he had grown up in Louisville.</t2353> <t2354>Asa Bird brought him to us at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.</t2354>
<t2355>Jordan smiled.</t2355>
<t2356>—He probably wanted to hitch a ride home.</t2356> <t2357>He told me he was the president of your class at Yale.</t2357>
<t2358>Tom and I looked at each other without understanding.</t2358>
<t2359>—Biloxi?</t2359>
<t2360>—First of all, we didn't have a president.</t2360>
<t2361>Gatsby's foot was tapping rhythmically on the floor, nervously, and Tom suddenly looked at him.</t2361>
<t2362>—By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand that you are a former Oxford student.</t2362>
<t2363>—Not exactly.</t2363>
<t2364>—Yes, I understand that he went to Oxford.</t2364>
<t2365>—Yes, I went to Oxford.</t2365>
<t2366>Pause.</t2366> <t2367>And then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting.</t2367>
<t2368>—It must have been around the same time that Biloxi went to New Haven.</t2368>
<t2369>Another pause.</t2369> <t2370>A waiter knocked on the door with mint and crushed ice, but neither his "thank you" nor the door closing softly broke the silence.</t2370> <t2371>That extraordinary detail was finally going to be clarified.</t2371>
<t2372>—I already told you that I was in Oxford.</t2372>
<t2373>—I have heard it, but I would like to know when.</t2373>
<t2374>—It was in 1919.</t2374> <t2375>I was only there for five months.</t2375> <t2376>That's why I can't consider myself an alumnus of Oxford.</t2376>
<t2377>Tom glanced around to see if, like a mirror, we reflected his disbelief.</t2377> <t2378>But we were looking at Gatsby.</t2378>
<t2379>—It was an opportunity given to some officers after the armistice —he continued—.</t2379> <t2380>We could go to any university in England or France.</t2380>
<t2381>I felt like getting up and giving him a pat on the back.</t2381> <t2382>I felt one of those renewals of absolute confidence in him that I had experienced before.</t2382>
<t2383>Daisy stood up, smiling faintly, and approached the table.</t2383>
<t2384>—Open the whiskey, Tom —he ordered—.</t2384> <t2385>And I'll make you a mint julep.</t2385> <t2386>Then you won't feel so stupid...</t2386> <t2387>Tell me how much mint to put in.</t2387>
<t2388>—Wait a second —Tom interrupted her, violently—.</t2388> <t2389>I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.</t2389>
<t2390>—Go ahead —said Gatsby, very properly.</t2390>
<t2391>—What kind of conflict are you trying to provoke in my house?</t2391>
<t2392>At last they were speaking openly and Gatsby seemed satisfied.</t2392>
<t2393>—He is not causing any conflict —Daisy looked at one and the other in desperation—.</t2393> <t2394>You are the one causing it.</t2394> <t2395>Please, control yourself a little.</t2395>
<t2396>—Control me! —repeated Tom, incredulous—.</t2396> <t2397>I suppose the latest trend is to sit back and let some Nobody from I don't know where fall in love with your wife.</t2397> <t2398>Well, if that's the idea, don't count on me…</t2398> <t2399>These days, it starts with despising family life and the family institution, and the next step will be throwing everything overboard and allowing marriages between whites and blacks.</t2399>
<t2400>In the euphoria of his passionate absurdities, he already saw himself defending the last barrier of civilization alone.</t2400>
<t2401>—Here we are all white —murmured Jordan.</t2401>
<t2402>—I know I'm not very likable.</t2402> <t2403>I don't throw big parties.</t2403> <t2404>I suppose you have to turn your house into a pigsty to have friends… in the modern world.</t2404>
<t2405>Although it had put me in a bad mood —like everyone else—, I felt true temptations to laugh every time Tom opened his mouth.</t2405> <t2406>His transition from libertine to prude had been perfect.</t2406>
<t2407>—I have something to tell you, comrade —Gatsby began.</t2407>
<t2408>But Daisy guessed his intention.</t2408>
<t2409>—Enough, please! —he interrupted him with a gesture of helplessness—.</t2409> <t2410>Please, let's go home.</t2410> <t2411>Why don't we all go home?</t2411>
<t2412>—It's a good idea —I stood up—.</t2412> <t2413>Let's go, Tom.</t2413> <t2414>No one feels like having a drink.</t2414>
<t2415>—I want to know what mister Gatsby has to say to me.</t2415>
<t2416>—His wife doesn't love him —said Gatsby—.</t2416> <t2417>She never loved him.</t2417> <t2418>She loves me.</t2418>
<t2419>—You must be crazy! —exclaimed Tom automatically.</t2419>
<t2420>Gatsby jumped to his feet, tense with emotion.</t2420>
<t2421>—She has never loved you, do you hear? —he shouted—.</t2421> <t2422>She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me.</t2422> <t2423>It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart, she has never loved anyone, only me.</t2423>
<t2424>At that moment, Jordan and I tried to leave, but Tom and Gatsby, competing in firmness, insisted that we stay, as if neither of them had anything to hide and it was a privilege to indirectly share their emotions.</t2424>
<t2425>—Sit down, Daisy —Tom was trying, unsuccessfully, to find a paternal tone—.</t2425> <t2426>What happened?</t2426> <t2427>I want to know everything.</t2427>
<t2428>—I have already told you what happened —said Gatsby—.</t2428> <t2429>For five years…</t2429> <t2430>And you didn't know.</t2430>
<t2431>Tom, cuttingly, turned towards Gatsby.</t2431>
<t2432>—Have you been seeing this guy for five years?</t2432>
<t2433>—Seeing, no —said Gatsby—.</t2433> <t2434>No, we couldn't.</t2434> <t2435>But we have loved each other all this time, old sport, and you didn't know it.</t2435> <t2436>Sometimes I laughed —but there was no laughter in his eyes— thinking that you didn't know it.</t2436>
<t2437>—Ah, that's all —Tom joined his thumbs together like a priest and leaned back in the armchair—.</t2437> <t2438>You're crazy! —he burst out—.</t2438> <t2439>I can't talk about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then.</t2439> <t2440>But damn me if I understand how you could get within a kilometer of Daisy unless you were delivering groceries to the service door.</t2440> <t2441>Everything else is a damn lie.</t2441> <t2442>Daisy loved me when she married me and she still loves me.</t2442>
<t2443>—No —said Gatsby, shaking his head.</t2443>
<t2444>—She loves me, despite everything.</t2444> <t2445>The problem is that sometimes she gets silly ideas in her head and doesn't know what she's doing —Tom nodded wisely—.</t2445> <t2446>And, what's more, I also love Daisy.</t2446> <t2447>Every now and then I go on a spree and act like an idiot, but I always come back and, deep down in my heart, I've never stopped loving her.</t2447>
<t2448>—You are disgusting —said Daisy.</t2448> <t2449>She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave, filled the room with emotion and disdain—.</t2449> <t2450>Don't you know why we left Chicago?</t2450> <t2451>I'm amazed that they haven't told you the story of that spree.</t2451>
<t2452>Gatsby took a few steps and stood by her side.</t2452>
<t2453>—Daisy, all of that is over —he said passionately—.</t2453> <t2454>It doesn't matter anymore.</t2454> <t2455>Tell him the truth, that you never loved him, and everything will be over forever.</t2455>
<t2456>Daisy looked at him without seeing him.</t2456>
<t2457>—But how, how could I have wanted it?</t2457>
<t2458>—You have never loved him.</t2458>
<t2459>Daisy hesitated.</t2459> <t2460>She looked at Jordan and me as if pleading, as if she finally realized what she was doing, and as if she had never, during all that time, had the slightest intention of doing anything.</t2460> <t2461>But it was already done.</t2461> <t2462>It was too late.</t2462>
<t2463>—I have never wanted it —he said with evident reluctance.</t2463>
<t2464>—Not even in Kapiolani? —asked Tom suddenly.</t2464>
<t2465>—No.</t2465>
<t2466>From the ballroom, amidst waves of hot air, muffled and stifling chords reached us.</t2466>
<t2467>—Not even the day I carried you in my arms from the Punch Bowl so your shoes wouldn't get wet, Daisy? —there was a hoarse tenderness in his tone.</t2467>
<t2468>—Please, stop —the voice sounded cold, but the resentment had disappeared.</t2468> <t2469>She looked at Gatsby—.</t2469> <t2470>You see, Jay —she said, but her hand trembled when she tried to light a cigarette.</t2470> <t2471>Suddenly, she threw the cigarette and the lit match onto the carpet—.</t2471> <t2472>You ask too much! —she shouted at Gatsby—.</t2472> <t2473>I love you, isn't that enough?</t2473> <t2474>I can't erase the past —she began to sob uncontrollably—.</t2474> <t2475>I loved him, but I also loved you.</t2475>
<t2476>Gatsby's eyes opened and closed.</t2476>
<t2477>—Did you also love me? —he repeated.</t2477>
<t2478>—Even that is a lie —said Tom ruthlessly—.</t2478> <t2479>I didn't even know if you were still alive.</t2479> <t2480>There are things between Daisy and me that you will never know, things that neither of us will ever forget.</t2480>
<t2481>The words seemed to bite into Gatsby's body.</t2481>
<t2482>—I want to speak alone with Daisy —he insisted—.</t2482> <t2483>She is too upset right now…</t2483>
<t2484>—Not even when I'm alone can I say that I never loved Tom —admitted Daisy with a broken voice—.</t2484> <t2485>It wouldn't be true.</t2485>
<t2486>—Of course not —agreed Tom.</t2486>
<t2487>Daisy turned to her husband.</t2487>
<t2488>—As if you cared —he said.</t2488>
<t2489>—Of course I care.</t2489> <t2490>I'm going to take better care of you from now on.</t2490>
<t2491>—You haven't understood —said Gatsby with a shadow of panic—.</t2491> <t2492>She will not take care of her again.</t2492>
<t2493>—No? —Tom opened his eyes wide and burst out laughing.</t2493> <t2494>He no longer had trouble controlling himself—.</t2494> <t2495>And why is that?</t2495>
<t2496>—Daisy is going to leave him.</t2496>
<t2497>—Nonsense.</t2497>
<t2498>—Well, it's true —she said with evident effort.</t2498>
<t2499>—She is not going to leave me! —Tom's words suddenly fell upon Gatsby—.</t2499> <t2500>And, of course, not for a common swindler who would have to steal the ring he put on her finger.</t2500>
<t2501>—This is unbearable! —shouted Daisy—.</t2501> <t2502>Let's go, please!</t2502>
<t2503>—Because who are you after all? —Tom concluded—.</t2503> <t2504>One of the gang that surrounds Meyer Wolfshiem, from what I have been able to find out.</t2504> <t2505>I've looked into your affairs a bit, and tomorrow I will continue.</t2505>
<t2506>—You can do whatever you think is appropriate about it, comrade —said Gatsby calmly.</t2506>
<t2507>—I have discovered what their drugstores were —he addressed us, speaking very quickly—.</t2507> <t2508>He and that Wolfshiem bought a bunch of drugstores in alleys here and in Chicago and dedicated themselves to selling bootleg liquor.</t2508> <t2509>That is one of their tricks.</t2509> <t2510>He seemed like a bootlegger to me the first time I saw him, and I wasn't too far off.</t2510>
<t2511>—And what? —said Gatsby with great correctness—.</t2511> <t2512>I believe that pride did not prevent your friend Walter Chase from participating in the business.</t2512>
<t2513>—And you left him in the lurch, didn't you?</t2513> <t2514>You let him spend a month in the New Jersey jail.</t2514> <t2515>Good heavens!</t2515> <t2516>You should hear what Walter says about you.</t2516>
<t2517>—He came to us without a cent.</t2517> <t2518>He was very happy to take some money with him, comrade.</t2518>
<t2519>—Don't call me comrade! —shouted Tom. Gatsby said nothing—.</t2519> <t2520>Walter could have reported them for the betting affair, but Wolfshiem scared him into keeping his mouth shut.</t2520>
<t2521>Gatsby's face had regained that expression of his, strange and yet recognizable.</t2521>
<t2522>—The drugstore business was just small change —Tom continued slowly—, but now he's got something going on that Walter doesn't dare to tell me about.</t2522>
<t2523>I observed Daisy, who was staring, terrified, at Gatsby or her husband, and Jordan, who had started to balance an invisible but absorbing object on her chin.</t2523> <t2524>Then I turned to Gatsby and was frightened by his expression.</t2524> <t2525>He seemed —and I say this with absolute contempt for the slanders heard in his garden— to have killed someone.</t2525> <t2526>For a moment, the expression on his face could have been described in that fantastic way.</t2526>
<t2527>That moment passed, and Gatsby began to speak to Daisy very nervously, denying everything, defending his name from accusations that no one had made.</t2527> <t2528>But with each word, she retreated further into herself, and Gatsby gave up, and only the dead dream continued its struggle as the afternoon faded, trying to reach what was no longer tangible, fighting without luck and without despair, searching for the lost voice at the back of the room.</t2528>
<t2529>The voice pleaded again for us to leave.</t2529>
<t2530>—Please, Tom! I can't take it anymore.</t2530>
<t2531>Her frightened eyes said that all her courage and all her intentions, whatever they might have been, had disappeared definitively.</t2531>
<t2532>—Go home with him, Daisy —said Tom—.</t2532> <t2533>In Mr. Gatsby's car.</t2533>
<t2534>Daisy looked at Tom, alarmed, but he insisted with magnanimous disdain:</t2534>
<t2535>—Come in.</t2535> <t2536>It won't bother you.</t2536> <t2537>I think he has realized that his ridiculous and presumptuous flirting is over.</t2537>
<t2538>They left, without a word, excluded, turned into something insignificant, isolated, like ghosts, on the fringes, even, of our pity.</t2538>
<t2539>A few minutes later, Tom got up and started wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.</t2539>
<t2540>—Do you want a drink? Jordan? Nick?</t2540>
<t2541>I didn't answer.</t2541>
<t2542>—Nick? —she asked me again.</t2542>
<t2543>—What?</t2543>
<t2544>—Do you want?</t2544>
<t2545>—No.</t2545> <t2546>I just remembered that today is my birthday.</t2546>
<t2547>I was turning thirty.</t2547> <t2548>Before me stretched the wondrous and threatening path of a new decade.</t2548>
<t2549>It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupe with Tom and headed towards Long Island.</t2549> <t2550>Tom didn't stop talking and laughing, exuberant, but his voice seemed as distant to Jordan and me as the clamor of strangers on the sidewalks or the clatter of the elevated train above our heads.</t2550> <t2551>Compassion has its limits, and we were glad that the tragic arguments of others were left behind and faded away like the city lights.</t2551> <t2552>Thirty years: the promise of a decade of loneliness, a dwindling list of bachelors to meet, a dwindling reserve of enthusiasm, dwindling hair.</t2552> <t2553>But beside me was Jordan, who, unlike Daisy, was too smart to drag forgotten dreams from one era to another.</t2553> <t2554>As we crossed the dimly lit bridge, her pale and lazy face rested on the shoulder of my jacket and the reassuring pressure of her hand calmed the formidable blow of thirty years.</t2554>
<t2555>Thus we continued the journey towards death through the evening, which was beginning to cool down.</t2555>
<t2556>Michaelis, the young Greek who ran the café next to the heaps of ashes, was the main witness in the investigation.</t2556> <t2557>He had fallen asleep due to the heat until after five, then he had taken a walk to the garage and found George Wilson, sick in his office, truly sick, pale like his faded hair, and shivering, trembling.</t2557> <t2558>Michaelis advised him to lie down, but Wilson refused, saying that if he did, he would lose a lot of money.</t2558> <t2559>While his neighbor tried to convince him, a violent commotion broke out upstairs.</t2559>
<t2560>—I have my wife locked up —explained Wilson very calmly—.</t2560> <t2561>She will be there until the day after tomorrow.</t2561> <t2562>And that day we are leaving.</t2562>
<t2563>Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and he had never believed Wilson capable of saying something like what he had just said.</t2563> <t2564>Usually, he was one of those defeated men: when he wasn't working, he would sit in a chair at the entrance and watch the people and cars passing by on the road.</t2564> <t2565>If someone spoke to him, he would always laugh in a pleasant and naive way.</t2565> <t2566>It was about his wife, not about himself.</t2566>
<t2567>And, naturally, Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson didn't say a word and cast strange suspicious glances at his neighbor, asking him what he had done at certain hours on certain days.</t2567> <t2568>Michaelis was starting to feel annoyed when some workers passed by the door on their way to the restaurant, and he took the opportunity to leave, intending to return later.</t2568> <t2569>But he did not return.</t2569> <t2570>He thinks he forgot.</t2570> <t2571>When he went out again, shortly after seven, he remembered the conversation because he heard Mistress Wilson's indignant shouts on the ground floor of the garage.</t2571>
<t2572>—Hit me! —he heard her scream—.</t2572> <t2573>Throw me to the ground and hit me, you disgusting coward, miserable!</t2573>
<t2574>A moment later, she rushed into the darkness of the street, waving her arms and screaming, and before Michaelis could move from his door, it was all over.</t2574>
<t2575>The "death car," as the newspapers called it, did not stop; it emerged from the increasingly dark night, tragically hesitated for a moment, and disappeared around the nearest curve.</t2575> <t2576>Michaelis was not sure of the color: he told the first policeman that it was light green.</t2576> <t2577>Another car, heading towards New York, stopped almost a hundred meters further on, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, after violently losing her life, had ended up kneeling on the road, mixing her thick, dark blood with the dust.</t2577>
<t2578>That man and Michaelis arrived first, but when they tore open her blouse, still damp with sweat, they saw that her left breast, loose, moved like a flap, and it was unnecessary to try to hear the heartbeat.</t2578> <t2579>Her mouth had opened wide, with the corners slightly torn, as if it had been traumatic for her to release the tremendous vitality she had accumulated for so long.</t2579>
<t2580>We saw the three or four cars and the group of people when we were still at a certain distance.</t2580>
<t2581>—An accident! —said Tom—.</t2581> <t2582>That's good.</t2582> <t2583>Finally, Wilson will have some work.</t2583>
<t2584>He slowed down, although he still had no intention of stopping, until, closer, the muted and concentrated faces of the people at the garage door forced him to brake automatically.</t2584>
<t2585>—Let's take a look —he said, unsure—, just a look.</t2585>
<t2586>I became aware at that moment of a dull, plaintive sound that was incessantly emanating from the garage, a sound that, as we got out of the coupe and approached the door, turned into the words "My God, my God," whispered over and over in a kind of death rattle.</t2586>
<t2587>—Something serious has happened here —said Tom, worried.</t2587>
<t2588>She stood on tiptoe to look over a circle of heads into the garage's interior, illuminated by a solitary yellow light that, protected by a metal grille, hung from the ceiling.</t2588> <t2589>Her throat then emitted a hoarse sound, and, shoving, she made her way through with the strength of her arms.</t2589>
<t2590>The circle closed again with an energetic murmur of protest and for a moment I couldn't see anything.</t2590> <t2591>Then more people arrived, the line broke, and suddenly, Jordan and I were pushed inside.</t2591>
<t2592>The body of Myrtle Wilson, covered by a blanket over which another blanket had been thrown, as if she had felt cold that hot night, lay on a worktable, next to the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was leaning over it, motionless.</t2592> <t2593>Beside him, a traffic policeman, sweating and making many corrections, was jotting down names in a notebook.</t2593> <t2594>At first, I couldn't locate the source of the words and the sharp wails that echoed loudly in the unfurnished garage, and then I saw Wilson, in the doorway of his office, standing on the only step, swaying, clutching the door jambs with both hands.</t2594> <t2595>A man was speaking to him in a low voice and, from time to time, tried to put a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw.</t2595> <t2596>He very slowly lowered his eyes, from the light hanging from the ceiling to the table and its burden next to the wall, only to return with a spasm to the light, without ever ceasing his sharp and terrible cry:</t2596>
<t2597>—My God! My God! My God!</t2597>
<t2598>Suddenly, as if startled, Tom lifted his head and, after scanning the garage with a glassy gaze, mumbled something incoherent to the policeman.</t2598>
<t2599>—E, m, a, v... —said the policeman at that moment—, o...</t2599>
<t2600>—No, it's erre… —corrected the man—.</t2600> <t2601>E, m, a, r, r, o…</t2601>
<t2602>—Pay attention to me! —murmured Tom, fiercely.</t2602>
<t2603>—uh… —said the policeman—, or…</t2603>
<t2604>—ge...</t2604>
<t2605>—Wh… —he looked up when Tom's broad hand suddenly fell on his shoulder—.</t2605> <t2606>What do you want, friend?</t2606>
<t2607>—What happened?</t2607> <t2608>That's what I want to know.</t2608>
<t2609>—A car hit her.</t2609> <t2610>It killed her instantly.</t2610>
<t2611>—He killed her on the spot —repeated Tom, with a distant look.</t2611>
<t2612>—He ran out onto the road.</t2612> <t2613>That son of a bitch didn't even stop the car.</t2613>
<t2614>—There were two cars —said Michaelis—.</t2614> <t2615>One was going and the other was coming, do you understand?</t2615>
<t2616>—Where was I going? —asked the police officer with great interest.</t2616>
<t2617>—Each one in a different direction.</t2617> <t2618>Well, she… —the hand lifted towards the blankets but stopped halfway and fell back to her side—.</t2618> <t2619>She ran out and the car coming from New York hit her directly.</t2619> <t2620>It was going fifty or sixty kilometers per hour.</t2620>
<t2621>—What is this place called? —asked the agent.</t2621>
<t2622>—It has no name.</t2622>
<t2623>A pale black man, well-dressed, approached.</t2623>
<t2624>—It was a yellow car —he said—, yellow and big.</t2624> <t2625>New.</t2625>
<t2626>—Did you see the accident? —asked the police officer.</t2626>
<t2627>—No, but the car passed by me on the road.</t2627> <t2628>It was going over sixty.</t2628> <t2629>It was going eighty or ninety.</t2629>
<t2630>—Come and tell me your name.</t2630> <t2631>Now, silence.</t2631> <t2632>I want to write down your name.</t2632>
<t2633>Some words from the conversation must have reached Wilson, who was swaying in the office doorway, because suddenly a new topic found voice among his moaning shouts.</t2633>
<t2634>—You don't need to tell me what the car was like!</t2634> <t2635>I know what it was like!</t2635>
<t2636>I looked at Tom and saw the muscles in his back tense under his jacket.</t2636> <t2637>He went towards where Wilson was and, stopping in front of him, grabbed him firmly by the arms.</t2637>
<t2638>—You have to get a grip —he said brusquely, to reassure him.</t2638>
<t2639>Wilson's eyes fixed on Tom.</t2639> <t2640>He rose up on his tiptoes, and if Tom hadn't caught him, he would have collapsed to his knees.</t2640>
<t2641>—Listen —said Tom, shaking him—.</t2641> <t2642>I just arrived from New York a moment ago.</t2642> <t2643>I brought the coupe we had talked about.</t2643> <t2644>The yellow car I was driving this afternoon is not mine.</t2644> <t2645>Do you hear me?</t2645> <t2646>I haven't seen you all afternoon.</t2646>
<t2647>The black man and I were the only ones close enough to hear what Tom was saying, but the policeman caught something in the tone of his voice and looked at us with hostile eyes.</t2647>
<t2648>—What's going on there? —he asked.</t2648>
<t2649>—I am his friend —Tom turned his head, but his hands continued to firmly hold Wilson's body—.</t2649> <t2650>He says he knows the car from the accident…</t2650> <t2651>It was a yellow car.</t2651>
<t2652>By some indeterminate instinct, the police officer considered Tom suspicious.</t2652>
<t2653>—And what color is his car?</t2653>
<t2654>—Blue.</t2654> <t2655>It's a coupe.</t2655>
<t2656>—We have come directly from New York —I said.</t2656>
<t2657>One person who had followed us with his car for a while confirmed what I was saying, and the police officer turned around.</t2657>
<t2658>—Let's see if I can write your name correctly now…</t2658>
<t2659>Grabbing Wilson like a doll, Tom put him in the office, sat him in a chair, and returned.</t2659>
<t2660>—Please, someone come and keep him company —he commanded with genuine authority.</t2660>
<t2661>He remained vigilant until the two men who were closest exchanged a look and reluctantly entered the room.</t2661> <t2662>Tom then closed the door, stepped down the single step, and avoided looking toward the garage table.</t2662> <t2663>When he passed by me, he murmured:</t2663>
<t2664>—Let's go.</t2664>
<t2665>Timidly, but with the authority of Tom's arms to clear the way, we advanced through the group of people, which continued to grow, and left behind a doctor who was arriving in a hurry with his briefcase in hand, and who had been called half an hour earlier in a burst of wild hope.</t2665>
<t2666>Tom drove slowly until we passed the curve.</t2666> <t2667>Then he floored the accelerator and the coupe sped into the night at full speed.</t2667> <t2668>Shortly after, I heard a rough, stifled sob, and saw tears streaming down his face.</t2668>
<t2669>—Damn cowardly son of a bitch! —he whimpered—.</t2669> <t2670>He didn't even stop.</t2670>
<t2671>The Buchanan's house suddenly floated towards us through the murmur and darkness of the trees.</t2671> <t2672>Tom stopped in front of the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows opened illuminated among the vines.</t2672>
<t2673>—Daisy is at home —he said.</t2673> <t2674>As we got out of the car, he looked at me and furrowed his brow—.</t2674> <t2675>I should have left you in West Egg, Nick.</t2675> <t2676>Tonight we can't do anything.</t2676>
<t2677>He had undergone a change, and he spoke with gravity and decision.</t2677> <t2678>We walked by moonlight along the gravel path that leads to the porch, and Tom settled the situation with a couple of conclusive phrases.</t2678>
<t2679>—I will call a taxi to take you home, and while you wait, it's best if you go with Jordan to the kitchen so they can prepare some dinner for you, if you feel like it —he opened the door—.</t2679> <t2680>Come in.</t2680>
<t2681>—No, thank you.</t2681> <t2682>But I would appreciate it if you could call me a taxi.</t2682> <t2683>I'll wait outside.</t2683>
<t2684>Jordan put his hand on my arm.</t2684>
<t2685>—Don't you want to come in, Nick?</t2685>
<t2686>—No, thank you.</t2686>
<t2687>I felt bad and wanted to be alone.</t2687> <t2688>But Jordan insisted a little more.</t2688>
<t2689>—It's only nine-thirty —he said.</t2689>
<t2690>Staying would have been a curse: an entire day in their company already seemed enough to me, and that, unexpectedly, also included Jordan, who must have sensed something of that in my expression, because he turned around, ran up the porch stairs, and went into the house.</t2690> <t2691>I sat for a while with my head in my hands until I heard the phone being picked up and the butler's voice asking for a taxi.</t2691> <t2692>Then I slowly walked down the path with the idea of waiting by the gate.</t2692>
<t2693>I had not gone twenty meters when I heard my name and Gatsby emerged from between two bushes.</t2693> <t2694>I must have been very distracted at that moment because all I could think about was the brightness of Gatsby's pink suit under the moon.</t2694>
<t2695>—What are you doing? —I asked.</t2695>
<t2696>—Just being here, buddy.</t2696>
<t2697>It seemed to me a despicable occupation, I don't know why.</t2697> <t2698>For all I knew, he could rob the house at any moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see the sinister faces of "Wolfshiem's gang" behind him, in the darkness of the bushes,</t2698>
<t2699>—Have you seen anything on the road? —he asked after a few seconds.</t2699>
<t2700>—Yes.</t2700>
<t2701>—Has he died?</t2701>
<t2702>—Yes.</t2702>
<t2703>—That's what I thought, and I told Daisy.</t2703> <t2704>It was better for her to get the impression all at once.</t2704> <t2705>She handled it very well.</t2705>
<t2706>He spoke as if Daisy's reaction were the only thing that mattered.</t2706>
<t2707>—I went to West Egg by a back road —he continued— and left the car in my garage.</t2707> <t2708>I think no one saw us, but, of course, I'm not sure.</t2708>
<t2709>It had become so unpleasant for me that I didn't consider it necessary to tell him that he was wrong.</t2709>
<t2710>—Who was the woman? —he asked.</t2710>
<t2711>—His name was Wilson.</t2711> <t2712>Her husband is the owner of the garage.</t2712> <t2713>How the hell did it happen?</t2713>
<t2714>—I tried to turn the steering wheel… —he stopped talking and suddenly I guessed the truth.</t2714>
<t2715>—Was Daisy driving?</t2715>
<t2716>—Yes —he said after a few seconds—, but I will say that it was me, of course.</t2716> <t2717>You know, when we left New York she was very nervous and thought that driving would calm her down…</t2717> <t2718>And that woman appeared running just as we were passing a car coming in the opposite direction.</t2718> <t2719>Everything happened in an instant, but I think the woman wanted to tell us something, that she mistook us for someone she knew.</t2719> <t2720>Well, Daisy first turned towards the other car to avoid the woman, but then she lost her nerve and turned back.</t2720> <t2721>At the moment my hand reached the steering wheel, I felt the impact.</t2721> <t2722>It must have killed her instantly.</t2722>
<t2723>—He destroyed it.</t2723>
<t2724>—Don't tell me, buddy —he made a gesture of pain—.</t2724> <t2725>Well, Daisy sped up.</t2725> <t2726>I tried to make her stop, but she couldn't, so I pulled the handbrake.</t2726> <t2727>Then she threw herself into my arms and I kept driving.</t2727> <t2728>She'll be fine tomorrow —he added quickly—.</t2728> <t2729>I'm going to wait here in case he tries to bother her because of what happened this afternoon, so unpleasant.</t2729> <t2730>She has locked herself in her room, and if he tries any brutality, she'll turn the light on and off several times.</t2730>
<t2731>—Tom won't touch it —I said—.</t2731> <t2732>He doesn't think about it.</t2732>
<t2733>—I don't trust him, mate.</t2733>
<t2734>—How long are you going to wait?</t2734>
<t2735>—All night, if necessary.</t2735> <t2736>At least until everyone goes to bed.</t2736>
<t2737>Then I saw the matter from another perspective.</t2737> <t2738>Suppose Tom discovered that the one driving was Daisy.</t2738> <t2739>He could sense some connection, anything...</t2739> <t2740>I looked toward the house; there were two or three windows with light, and on the second floor, the pink glow of Daisy's room.</t2740>
<t2741>—Wait here —I said to Gatsby—.</t2741> <t2742>I'm going to see if there's any sign of trouble.</t2742>
<t2743>I returned skirting the lawn, crossed the gravel path without making a sound, and tiptoed up the steps of the gallery.</t2743>
<t2744>The living room curtains were open, and I checked that there was no one in the room.</t2744> <t2745>Passing the porch where we had dined that night in June three months earlier, I reached a small rectangle of light that I imagined to be the window of the scullery.</t2745> <t2746>The shutter was down, but I discovered a crack in the windowsill.</t2746>
<t2747>Daisy and Tom sat at the kitchen table, facing each other, with a plate of cold chicken between them and two bottles of beer.</t2747> <t2748>He spoke with absolute concentration and, very seriously, placed his hand on Daisy's hand, covering it.</t2748> <t2749>From time to time, she would look up, look at him, and nod her head.</t2749>
<t2750>They were sad, and they hadn't touched either the chicken or the beer, but they didn't feel miserable.</t2750> <t2751>There was an air of intimacy, of naturalness in the scene, and anyone would have taken them for two conspirators.</t2751>
<t2752>When I was tiptoeing out of the porch, I heard my taxi approaching the house on the dark road.</t2752> <t2753>Gatsby was waiting on the path, where I had left him.</t2753>
<t2754>—Is everything calm? —he asked me, worried.</t2754>
<t2755>—Yes, everything is calm —I stammered—.</t2755> <t2756>It would be better if you came home to sleep.</t2756>
<t2757>He shook his head no.</t2757>
<t2758>—I will wait here until Daisy goes to bed.</t2758> <t2759>Good night, buddy.</t2759>
<t2760>He put his hands in the pockets of his jacket and once again scrutinized the house jealously, as if my presence tainted the sanctity of his sentinel mission.</t2760> <t2761>So I left and left him there, in the moonlight, watching over nothing.</t2761>
<t2762>8</t2762>
<t2763>I couldn't sleep all night; a foghorn kept wailing in the strait, and I tossed and turned like a sick person between grotesque reality and deranged, terrifying nightmares.</t2763> <t2764>Towards dawn, I heard a taxi coming up the road to Gatsby's house, and I immediately jumped out of bed and started to get dressed: I felt that I had something to tell him, that I needed to warn him about something, and that by morning it would already be too late.</t2764>
<t2765>When I was crossing the lawn, I saw that the main door was still open and that Gatsby was leaning on the hall table, overcome by dejection or sleep.</t2765>
<t2766>—Nothing happened —he said, weakly—.</t2766> <t2767>I waited, and around four o'clock Daisy looked out the window for a minute and then turned off the light.</t2767>
<t2768>The house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that early morning, when we launched into a hunt for cigarettes through the immense rooms.</t2768> <t2769>We drew back curtains that were like tents and groped for light switches along countless meters of walls in darkness.</t2769> <t2770>I fell once scandalously onto the keyboard of a ghostly piano.</t2770> <t2771>Dust covered everything in an inexplicable way, and the rooms smelled musty as if they hadn't been aired out for many days.</t2771> <t2772>I found the tobacco case on a table where it had never been before, with only two yellowed and dry cigarettes.</t2772> <t2773>We opened the glass doors of the living room and sat down to smoke in the darkness.</t2773>
<t2774>—You should leave —I told him—.</t2774> <t2775>They will locate the car, for sure.</t2775>
<t2776>—Leave right now, comrade?</t2776>
<t2777>—To Atlantic City for a week, or even to Montreal.</t2777>
<t2778>He didn't even want to think about it.</t2778> <t2779>He couldn't separate from Daisy before knowing what she was going to do.</t2779> <t2780>He clung to a last hope and I didn't feel capable of shaking him free.</t2780>
<t2781>That early morning he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody.</t2781> <t2782>He told it to me because "Jay Gatsby" had shattered like glass against the relentless malice of Tom, and the spectacular setup and its secret, which had lasted so long, were coming to an end.</t2782> <t2783>I believe that at that moment he would have admitted anything, without reservations, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.</t2783>
<t2784>She was the first "well-off" girl he had met.</t2784> <t2785>In some job he didn't specify, he had had contact with similar people, but always with an invisible fence in between.</t2785> <t2786>Daisy seemed overwhelmingly desirable to him.</t2786> <t2787>He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone.</t2787> <t2788>He was astonished: he had never set foot in such a wonderful house.</t2788> <t2789>But what gave the house an intensity that made it hard to breathe was that Daisy lived there.</t2789> <t2790>And to her, the house seemed as normal as Gatsby's tent at the camp seemed to him.</t2790> <t2791>Deep and mysterious, it promised more beautiful and cooler bedrooms upstairs than other bedrooms, radiant and joyful activities along its hallways, romances that didn't smell of mustiness and lavender, but new, fragrant and throbbing like the splendid latest model cars, like the dances where the flowers had just begun to wilt.</t2791> <t2792>And his fervor increased because many men had already loved Daisy: this made her more valuable in his eyes.</t2792> <t2793>He felt the presence of those strangers in every corner of the house, permeating the air with the shadows and echoes of emotions that still lived.</t2793>
<t2794>But he knew he was at Daisy's house by a colossal chance.</t2794> <t2795>As glorious as his future as Jay Gatsby might be, for the moment he was just a young man without money and without a past, and overnight the cloak that made him invisible, his officer's uniform, could fall from his shoulders.</t2795> <t2796>So he made the most of his time.</t2796> <t2797>He took everything within his reach, voraciously, without scruples.</t2797> <t2798>And he took Daisy one quiet October night.</t2798> <t2799>He took her because he had no right to hold her hand.</t2799>
<t2800>He might have despised himself, because it is undeniable that he won her over with deceit.</t2800> <t2801>I'm not saying he resorted to his phantasmagoric millions, but, with premeditation, he gave Daisy a sense of security, made her believe that he was a person of her same social class: that he was fully capable of taking care of her.</t2801> <t2802>The truth is that those were not his capabilities: he did not have the backing of a wealthy family, and he was subject to the impersonal whim of a government that could send him anywhere in the world.</t2802>
<t2803>But he did not despise himself, and things did not turn out as he had imagined.</t2803> <t2804>His intention was probably to take what he could and leave, but suddenly he realized that he had devoted himself to the search for the Holy Grail.</t2804> <t2805>He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he was not aware of just how extraordinary a "well-bred" girl could be.</t2805> <t2806>Daisy vanished into her very wealthy home, into her life of riches and abundance, and left Gatsby with nothing.</t2806> <t2807>He felt married to her, that was all.</t2807>
<t2808>When they saw each other again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was exhausted and, in a way, betrayed.</t2808> <t2809>The newly bought luxury of the stars illuminated the porch; the wicker sofa trembled and creaked in the latest fashion as she looked at Gatsby and he kissed her on the mouth, precious and rare.</t2809> <t2810>Daisy had caught a cold and her voice was huskier, more seductive than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth conceals and preserves, of the freshness that a good wardrobe provides, and of Daisy, radiant like silver, proud and safe, above the bitter struggles of the poor.</t2810>
<t2811>—I can't describe to you how surprised I was to discover that I had fallen in love with her, my friend.</t2811> <t2812>In fact, for a while, I hoped she would leave me, but she didn't, because she had also fallen in love with me.</t2812> <t2813>I believed that I knew many things because I knew different things from what she knew…</t2813> <t2814>Well, there I was, far from my ambitions, more and more in love, and suddenly all that stopped mattering to me.</t2814> <t2815>Why do great things if I could have more fun telling her what I was going to do?</t2815>
<t2816>The afternoon before leaving for Europe, he held Daisy in his arms for a long time, in silence.</t2816> <t2817>It was a cold autumn day, there was a fire in the fireplace, and her cheeks were flushed.</t2817> <t2818>From time to time she moved, and he slightly adjusted his arm's position and at one point kissed her dark, shiny hair.</t2818> <t2819>The afternoon had granted them a moment of tranquility, as if to leave them with a deep memory before the long separation that the next day promised.</t2819> <t2820>They had never felt so close in their month of love, they had never understood each other so deeply, as when she, in silence, brushed her lips against the shoulder of his uniform, or when he carefully touched her fingertips, as if she were asleep.</t2820>
<t2821>His behavior in the war was extraordinary.</t2821> <t2822>He was a captain before leaving for the front, and after the battles of Argonne, he was promoted to major and took command of the machine gun section of his division.</t2822> <t2823>After the armistice, he desperately tried to return home, but some misunderstanding or complication ended up taking him to Oxford.</t2823> <t2824>He was worried: Daisy's letters had an undertone of desperation and anxiety.</t2824> <t2825>He didn't understand why he wasn't returning.</t2825> <t2826>The pressure of the outside world affected her, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence and the reassurance that, despite everything, he was doing the right thing.</t2826>
<t2827>For Daisy was young and her artificial world smelled of orchids, of pleasant and cheerful snobbery, of orchestras marking the rhythms of the year, blending the sadness and fascination of life into new melodies.</t2827> <t2828>All night long the saxophones wailed their hopeless commentary to Beale Street Blues[22] while a hundred pairs of golden and silver dancing shoes shuffled over luminous dust.</t2828> <t2829>At the gray hour of tea, there were always rooms still throbbing with that sweet and gentle, inexhaustible fever, while young faces floated everywhere like rose petals blown by the sad brass instruments over the dance floor.</t2829>
<t2830>In this twilight universe, Daisy began to move again when the season started; suddenly she found herself with six dates a day with six different men, and falling asleep at dawn, with the beads and gauze of her evening dress tangled on the floor, among the dying orchids.</t2830> <t2831>And something inside her never ceased to demand a decision.</t2831> <t2832>She wanted her life to take shape now, immediately, and the decision had to be imposed by some force — love, money, or undeniable practical sense — within her reach.</t2832>
<t2833>That force materialized in full spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan.</t2833> <t2834>His person and his social position had a healthy volume, and Daisy felt flattered.</t2834> <t2835>There was, undoubtedly, some resistance and some relief.</t2835> <t2836>The letter reached Gatsby when he was still in Oxford.</t2836>
<t2837>Dawn had already broken in Long Island, and we began opening the other windows on the ground floor, filling the house with a light that shifted from gray to golden.</t2837> <t2838>The shadow of a tree suddenly fell over the dew, and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves.</t2838> <t2839>There was a pleasant and gentle movement in the air, barely a breeze, promising a cool, beautiful day.</t2839>
<t2840>—I don't think she ever loved him —Gatsby turned his back to the window and looked at me, defiantly—.</t2840> <t2841>Remember, old sport, how nervous she was yesterday afternoon.</t2841> <t2842>He told her all those things to scare her, to make me look like a common swindler.</t2842> <t2843>And the result was that in the end she barely knew what she was saying —he sat down, dejected—.</t2843> <t2844>Yes, maybe she loved him for a moment, when they had just gotten married, and even then she loved me more, do you understand? —and he concluded with a strange remark—.</t2844> <t2845>In any case, that's something personal.</t2845>
<t2846>What reaction was possible to those words, if not to suspect that Gatsby's notion of the matter exceeded any measure in intensity?</t2846>
<t2847>He returned from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their honeymoon, and spent what was left of his soldier's pay on an unfortunate and inevitable visit to Louisville.</t2847> <t2848>He stayed there for a week, walking the streets where their steps had echoed together that November night and revisiting the secluded places they had gone to in the white car.</t2848> <t2849>And just as Daisy's house had always seemed more mysterious and cheerful than the other houses, a melancholic beauty continued to permeate his idea of the city, even though Daisy was no longer there.</t2849>
<t2850>He left with the feeling that if he had searched more thoroughly, he would have found her, that he had left her behind.</t2850>
<t2851>In the cheapest train he found —he had run out of money— it was very hot.</t2851> <t2852>He went out to the open platform, took a folding seat, and the station began to move slowly, and he saw the backs of buildings he did not know recede into the distance.</t2852> <t2853>Then the spring fields appeared, where a yellow tram kept pace with the train for a few seconds, carrying people he might have seen once, on any street, Daisy's face, pale and magical.</t2853>
<t2854>The road made a curve and veered away from the sun, which, as it set, seemed to spill out a blessing over the city where she had breathed, and which was gradually fading away.</t2854> <t2855>He reached out desperately as if to grasp at least a breath of air, to hold onto a fragment of the place that Daisy had made extraordinary for him.</t2855> <t2856>But everything was already passing too quickly before his tear-filled eyes, and he knew that he had lost that reality, the best and most vivid one, forever.</t2856>
<t2857>It was nine in the morning when we finished breakfast and went out to the porch.</t2857> <t2858>The night had suddenly changed the weather and the air already tasted like autumn.</t2858> <t2859>The gardener, the last of Gatsby's old servants, approached the foot of the staircase.</t2859>
<t2860>—I'm going to empty the pool today, Mister Gatsby.</t2860> <t2861>The leaves have started falling too early, and then there are always problems with the drains.</t2861>
<t2862>—Don't empty it today —replied Gatsby.</t2862> <t2863>He turned to me, as if apologizing—.</t2863> <t2864>You know, old sport, I haven't used the pool all summer?</t2864>
<t2865>I looked at the clock and got up.</t2865>
<t2866>—My train leaves in twelve minutes.</t2866>
<t2867>I didn't feel like going to the city.</t2867> <t2868>I wasn't in any condition to work decently, and there was something else: I didn't want to leave Gatsby alone.</t2868> <t2869>I missed that train, and the next one, before leaving.</t2869>
<t2870>—I'll call you on the phone —I finally said.</t2870>
<t2871>—Yes, comrade.</t2871>
<t2872>—I'll call you around noon.</t2872>
<t2873>We slowly went down the steps.</t2873>
<t2874>—I suppose Daisy will call too —he looked at me anxiously, as if hoping I would confirm it.</t2874>
<t2875>—I suppose so.</t2875>
<t2876>—Goodbye.</t2876>
<t2877>We shook hands and I started walking.</t2877> <t2878>Before reaching the gate, I remembered something and turned back.</t2878>
<t2879>—They are bad people —I shouted to him across the lawn—.</t2879> <t2880>You are worth more than all of them put together.</t2880>
<t2881>I have always been glad I told him.</t2881> <t2882>It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I found him reprehensible from beginning to end.</t2882> <t2883>First he nodded, very polite, and then his face lit up with a radiant and conspiratorial smile, as if in that matter we had always been unwavering accomplices.</t2883> <t2884>The magnificent rags of his pink suit were a vivid splash of color against the white steps, and I remembered the night I first went to his ancestral home, three months earlier.</t2884> <t2885>The lawn and the path were then overrun by the faces of those speculating about his corruption, while he, standing on those steps, hiding his incorruptible dream, waved them goodbye.</t2885>
<t2886>I thanked him for his hospitality.</t2886> <t2887>The others and I never stopped thanking him for it.</t2887>
<t2888>—Goodbye —I shouted—.</t2888> <t2889>Breakfast was wonderful, Gatsby.</t2889>
<t2890>In New York, I spent a while trying to jot down the quotes from an endless list of stocks, and then I fell asleep in my swivel chair.</t2890> <t2891>I got a scare when, shortly before twelve, the phone woke me up.</t2891> <t2892>My forehead was covered in sweat.</t2892> <t2893>It was Jordan Baker: she usually called me at that hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels, clubs, and private houses made it difficult to reach her otherwise.</t2893> <t2894>Usually, her voice came to me through the telephone line as something young and fresh, as if a handful of grass from the golf course had flown in through the office window, but that morning it seemed harsh, dry.</t2894>
<t2895>—I have left Daisy's house —he said—.</t2895> <t2896>I am in Hempstead and I am going to Southampton this afternoon.</t2896>
<t2897>It was probably a tactful test to leave Daisy's house, but it bothered me, and what she said afterward managed to make me tense.</t2897>
<t2898>—Last night you weren't very kind to me.</t2898>
<t2899>—And what importance did that have last night?</t2899>
<t2900>Silence.</t2900> <t2901>And then:</t2901>
<t2902>—In any case, I would like to see you.</t2902>
<t2903>—I would also like to see you.</t2903>
<t2904>—And if I don't go to Southampton and go to the city this afternoon?</t2904>
<t2905>—No, I can't this afternoon.</t2905>
<t2906>—Very well.</t2906>
<t2907>—This afternoon is impossible for me.</t2907> <t2908>I have several...</t2908>
<t2909>We talked for a while, and then, suddenly, we stopped talking.</t2909> <t2910>I don't know which of us hung up the phone abruptly, but I know it didn't matter to me.</t2910> <t2911>That day I wouldn't have been able to sit down and talk and have tea with her, even if it meant never speaking to her again in my life.</t2911>
<t2912>I called Gatsby's house after a few minutes, but the line was busy.</t2912> <t2913>I tried four times.</t2913> <t2914>Finally, a desperate operator told me that the line was waiting for a long-distance call from Detroit.</t2914> <t2915>I looked at my train schedule and circled the three-fifty train.</t2915> <t2916>I leaned back in the chair and tried to think.</t2916> <t2917>It was exactly twelve o'clock.</t2917>
<t2918>When that morning I passed by train through the heaps of ashes, I preferred to sit on the other side of the carriage.</t2918> <t2919>I supposed that at the site of the accident there would be a crowd of onlookers, and children looking for sinister stains in the dust, and some charlatan who would tell the story over and over again, until everything became less real, even for him, who would no longer be able to keep telling his story, and the tragic tale of Myrtle Wilson would fall into oblivion.</t2919> <t2920>But now I would like to go back a bit and tell what happened in the garage after we left the previous night.</t2920>
<t2921>There were problems locating the sister, Catherine.</t2921> <t2922>It seems that she broke her rule of not drinking that night, because when she arrived she was dazed from the alcohol and was unable to understand that the ambulance had already left for Flushing.</t2922> <t2923>Immediately, when they finally managed to convince her, she fainted, as if that detail was the only intolerable part of the matter.</t2923> <t2924>Someone, kind or curious, took her in their car following the trail of her sister's corpse.</t2924>
<t2925>Until very late past midnight, an ever-changing crowd enjoyed the spectacle in front of the garage, while inside, George Wilson rocked himself on the sofa.</t2925> <t2926>The office door remained open for a moment, and everyone who entered the garage couldn't help but peek inside.</t2926> <t2927>Someone finally said it was a shame, and closed the door.</t2927> <t2928>With Wilson were Michaelis and several others, four or five at first, then two or three.</t2928> <t2929>Later, Michaelis had to ask the last newcomer to wait fifteen more minutes while he went to his place and made coffee.</t2929> <t2930>And then, he stayed alone with Wilson until dawn.</t2930>
<t2931>Around three in the morning, the nature of Wilson's incoherent murmuring changed; it became calmer, and he began to talk about the yellow car.</t2931> <t2932>He announced that he knew how to find out who the yellow car belonged to, and let slip that a couple of months earlier his wife had come back from the city with a bruised face and a swollen nose.</t2932>
<t2933>But, when he heard that, he made a grimace of pain and began to complain, "My God, my God," in a moaning voice.</t2933> <t2934>Michaelis tried to distract him without much skill.</t2934>
<t2935>—How long had you been married, George?</t2935> <t2936>Come on, stay still for a moment and answer me.</t2936> <t2937>How long had you been married?</t2937>
<t2938>—Twelve years.</t2938>
<t2939>—Haven't you had children?</t2939> <t2940>Come on, George, stop.</t2940> <t2941>I've asked you a question.</t2941> <t2942>Haven't you had children?</t2942>
<t2943>The beetles, brown and hard, continued to produce a dull noise when they collided with the poor electric light, and every time Michaelis heard a car speeding by on the road, he thought he heard the car that hadn't stopped a few hours earlier.</t2943> <t2944>He didn't like going into the garage because, on the table, in the spot where the corpse had lain, there was a stain, so he kept pacing around, uncomfortable, in the office —before dawn he had already memorized every single object inside— and from time to time he would sit with Wilson and try to calm him down.</t2944>
<t2945>—Do you have any church that you go to sometimes, George, even if you haven't gone in a long time?</t2945> <t2946>I could call for a priest to come and talk to you, couldn't I?</t2946>
<t2947>—I don't belong to any church.</t2947>
<t2948>—You should have a church, George, for occasions like this.</t2948> <t2949>You must have gone to church at some point.</t2949> <t2950>Didn't you get married in a church?</t2950> <t2951>Listen, George, listen to me.</t2951> <t2952>Didn't you get married in a church?</t2952>
<t2953>—That was a long time ago.</t2953>
<t2954>The effort to respond broke the rhythm of his swaying: he fell silent for a moment.</t2954> <t2955>Then his faded eyes regained their expression, somewhere between cunning and bewildered.</t2955>
<t2956>—Look in that drawer —he said, pointing to the desk.</t2956>
<t2957>—In which drawer?</t2957>
<t2958>—In that one, the only one there is.</t2958>
<t2959>Michaelis opened the drawer that was closest to him.</t2959> <t2960>The only thing inside was a very expensive dog leash, made of leather with silver decorations.</t2960> <t2961>It looked new.</t2961>
<t2962>—This? —he asked, lifting it.</t2962>
<t2963>Wilson stared at her intently and nodded.</t2963>
<t2964>—I found her yesterday afternoon.</t2964> <t2965>She tried to explain it to me, but I realized that there was something strange.</t2965>
<t2966>"Do you mean that your wife bought it?"</t2966>
<t2967>—She kept it in the dresser, wrapped in tissue paper.</t2967>
<t2968>Michaelis didn't see anything strange and gave Wilson a series of reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash.</t2968> <t2969>But it wasn't hard to imagine that Wilson had already heard some of those explanations before, and precisely from Myrtle, because he started murmuring "Oh my God, oh my God" again, and the friend who was consoling him left several explanations hanging in the air.</t2969>
<t2970>—Then he killed her —said Wilson.</t2970>
<t2971>His mouth suddenly opened.</t2971>
<t2972>—Who killed her?</t2972>
<t2973>—I know how to find out.</t2973>
<t2974>—Don't be morbid, George —said his friend—.</t2974> <t2975>You've had to endure a lot of stress and you don't know what you're saying.</t2975> <t2976>It's better for you to rest until tomorrow.</t2976>
<t2977>—He murdered her.</t2977>
<t2978>—It was an accident, George.</t2978>
<t2979>Wilson shook his head.</t2979> <t2980>His eyes narrowed and his lips slightly parted as he hinted at a superior "hmm."</t2980>
<t2981>—I know —he said firmly—.</t2981> <t2982>I'm one of those confident guys who don't think badly of anyone, but when I know something, I know it.</t2982> <t2983>It was the man who was in that car.</t2983> <t2984>She ran out to tell him something and he didn't stop.</t2984>
<t2985>Michaelis had also seen it, but he didn't think it had any special significance.</t2985> <t2986>He believed that Mrs. Wilson wanted to escape from her husband rather than stop a particular car.</t2986>
<t2987>—And why did he do it?</t2987>
<t2988>—She is very smart —said Wilson, as if that settled the matter—.</t2988> <t2989>Ahhh…</t2989>
<t2990>She was rocking again, and Michaelis stood up, twisting the strap between his fingers.</t2990>
<t2991>—Do you have any friend I can call on the phone, George?</t2991>
<t2992>It was a remote hope; Michaelis was almost sure that Wilson had no friends: he didn't even have enough for his wife.</t2992> <t2993>He was glad when he noticed a change in the room, a sign of blue life in the window, and realized that it wouldn't be long before dawn.</t2993> <t2994>Around five, the blue outside became intense enough to turn off the light.</t2994>
<t2995>Wilson's glassy eyes turned towards the heaps of ash, where gray clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried back and forth with the morning breeze.</t2995>
<t2996>—I spoke with her —he murmured after a long silence—.</t2996> <t2997>I told her that she could deceive me, but she couldn't deceive God.</t2997> <t2998>I took her to the window —he stood up with effort and went to lean against the window at the back of the office, with his face pressed against the glass— and I said to her: "God knows what you have done, everything you have done.</t2998> <t2999>You can deceive me, but not God!"</t2999>
<t3000>Standing behind him, Michaelis was startled to see that Wilson was looking into the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg, which had just emerged, enormous and pale, from the dissolving night.</t3000>
<t3001>"God sees everything," repeated Wilson.</t3001>
<t3002>—That is an advertisement —Michaelis assured him.</t3002>
<t3003>Something made him stop looking out the window and turn his gaze back to the room.</t3003>
<t3004>But Wilson stayed at the window for a long time, glued to the glass, nodding his head to the twilight light.</t3004>
<t3005>Shortly before six, Michaelis, exhausted, heard with gratitude that a car was stopping in front of the garage.</t3005> <t3006>It was one of the onlookers from the previous night who had promised to return, so he prepared breakfast for three, which the man and he ate together.</t3006> <t3007>Wilson was already calmer, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he woke up four hours later and immediately returned to the garage, Wilson was gone.</t3007>
<t3008>His movements —always on foot— were later reconstructed: from Port Roosevelt to Cad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich he did not eat and a coffee.</t3008> <t3009>He must have been tired and walking slowly, as he did not reach Cad’s Hill until noon.</t3009> <t3010>It was not difficult up to that point to reconstruct his hours: there were kids who saw an individual behaving "like a madman," and drivers whom he stared at in a strange way from the roadside.</t3010> <t3011>Then he disappeared for three hours.</t3011> <t3012>The police, based on what he had told Michaelis, that he "knew how to find out," assumed he had been going from garage to garage in the area, asking about a yellow car.</t3012> <t3013>But among the garage owners, none reported having seen him, and he might have resorted to an easier and safer way to find out what he wanted to know.</t3013> <t3014>No later than two-thirty, he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby's house.</t3014> <t3015>So by that time, he already knew Gatsby's name.</t3015>
<t3016>At two o'clock Gatsby put on his swimsuit and told the butler that if anyone called for him, he should be notified at the pool.</t3016> <t3017>He spent some time in the garage picking up an inflatable mattress that had entertained his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him inflate it.</t3017> <t3018>Then Gatsby gave him instructions not to take out the convertible under any circumstances, which was strange because the right front fender needed repair.</t3018>
<t3019>Gatsby threw the mattress over his shoulder and headed to the pool.</t3019> <t3020>He stopped once to get a better grip, and the chauffeur asked if he needed help, but he shook his head no and disappeared among the trees, which were already turning yellow.</t3020>
<t3021>Nobody called on the phone, but the butler missed his nap and waited until four: long after there was no one to notify in case of a call.</t3021> <t3022>I have the impression that even Gatsby no longer expected that call, and that he probably didn't care in the slightest.</t3022> <t3023>If this is true, he must have felt that he had lost his old world, its warmth, and that he had paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.</t3023> <t3024>He must have looked at a strange sky through the terrifying foliage, and shivered upon discovering how grotesque a rose is and how raw the sunlight is on grass that is still not fully created.</t3024> <t3025>A new world, material but not real, where poor ghosts who breathe dreams instead of air moved aimlessly, at random..., like that ashen and fantastic figure that glided towards him through the shapeless trees.</t3025>
<t3026>The chauffeur —he was one of Wolfshiem's protégés— heard the shots; then he simply said that he had not paid attention to them.</t3026> <t3027>I went directly from the station to Gatsby's house, and my frantic dash up the porch stairs was the first thing that caused alarm.</t3027> <t3028>But they already knew, I'm sure.</t3028> <t3029>Without saying hardly a word, four people, the chauffeur, the butler, the gardener, and I, ran towards the pool.</t3029>
<t3030>There was a weak movement in the water, barely perceptible: the clean stream that entered from one end flowed towards the drain on the other side.</t3030> <t3031>With minimal undulations that didn't even reach the shadows of waves, the mattress carried its load, erratically, across the pool: a breath of wind that barely wrinkled the surface was enough to disturb its fortuitous course with its fortuitous load.</t3031> <t3032>The brush with a tangle of leaves made it slowly spin, tracing, like a compass, a red circle in the water.</t3032>
<t3033>We were already taking Gatsby towards the house when the gardener saw Wilson's corpse among the grass, and the holocaust was complete.</t3033>
<t3034>9</t3034>
<t3035>Two years later I remember the rest of that day, and that night, and the following day, as an endless coming and going of police officers, photographers, and journalists through the front door of Gatsby's house.</t3035> <t3036>A rope, tied from one end of the gate to the other, and a policeman kept the curious at bay, but the children soon discovered they could enter through my garden, and there was always a group around the pool, with their mouths open.</t3036> <t3037>Someone with decisive gestures, perhaps a detective, used the word "crazy" when he leaned over Wilson's corpse that afternoon, and the unexpected authority of his voice set the tone for the reports that the newspapers published the next morning.</t3037>
<t3038>Most of those reports were a nightmare: grotesque, inconsequential, biased, and false.</t3038> <t3039>When Michaelis's testimony during the investigation brought to light Wilson's suspicions about his wife, I thought that immediately some sensationalist rag would serve us the complete story, but Catherine, who could have said anything, didn't say a word.</t3039> <t3040>She demonstrated a surprising firmness of character: she looked at the coroner with eyes full of determination under her plucked eyebrows, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby in her life, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had never taken a wrong step.</t3040> <t3041>She convinced herself of what she swore and soaked her handkerchief with tears, as if the slightest insinuation was more than she could bear.</t3041> <t3042>So Wilson was reduced to an "individual distraught with grief" to simplify the case as much as possible, and that was that.</t3042>
<t3043>But that part of the story seems distant and insubstantial to me.</t3043> <t3044>I found myself completely alone, next to Gatsby.</t3044> <t3045>From the moment I called West Egg to break the news of the catastrophe, all the conjectures about Gatsby and all the practical matters fell upon me.</t3045> <t3046>At first, I felt surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house, neither moving, nor breathing, nor speaking, hour after hour, I became convinced that I had to take responsibility, because there was no one else interested: interested, I say, with that intense personal interest to which anyone has a certain right when their end comes.</t3046>
<t3047>I called Daisy half an hour after we found him, I called her instinctively and without the slightest hesitation.</t3047> <t3048>But Tom and she had left earlier that afternoon, taking the luggage with them.</t3048>
<t3049>—Haven't they left an address?</t3049>
<t3050>—No.</t3050>
<t3051>—Have they said when they will return?</t3051>
<t3052>—No.</t3052>
<t3053>—Do you have any idea where they might be? How could I get in touch with them?</t3053>
<t3054>—I don't know.</t3054> <t3055>I can't tell you.</t3055>
<t3056>I wanted to find someone to accompany him.</t3056> <t3057>I wanted to enter the room where he lay and reassure him: "I will find someone for you, Gatsby.</t3057> <t3058>Don't worry.</t3058> <t3059>Trust me and I will find someone to keep you company."</t3059>
<t3060>The name Meyer Wolfshiem did not appear in the phone directory.</t3060> <t3061>The butler gave me the address of his office on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I got the number it was already past five, and the phone was not answered.</t3061>
<t3062>—Can you call again?</t3062>
<t3063>—I have already called three times —said the operator.</t3063>
<t3064>—It's very important.</t3064>
<t3065>—I'm sorry.</t3065> <t3066>I'm afraid there's no one here.</t3066>
<t3067>I returned to the living room and for a moment I thought that all those officials who had suddenly filled the house were people who had shown up by chance.</t3067> <t3068>But, when they lifted the sheet and looked at the corpse with astonished eyes, Gatsby's protest echoed in my brain: "Listen, buddy, bring someone to keep me company.</t3068> <t3069>Do everything you can.</t3069> <t3070>I can't bear this alone."</t3070>
<t3071>Someone started asking me questions, but I slipped away and went up to the second floor to search the drawers of the desk that were not locked: he had never explicitly told me that his parents had died.</t3071> <t3072>But there was nothing: only the photo of Dan Cody, a sign of forgotten violence, staring at me fixedly from the wall.</t3072>
<t3073>The next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter for Wolfshiem, asking for information and requesting that he come on the next train.</t3073> <t3074>This seemed superfluous to me when I wrote it.</t3074> <t3075>I was sure he would set out as soon as he read the newspapers, just as I was sure that, before noon, a telegram from Daisy would arrive.</t3075> <t3076>But neither the telegram nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived; no one came, except more police, more photographers, and more journalists.</t3076> <t3077>When the butler returned with Wolfshiem's reply, I began to feel a sense of defiance, contempt, and solidarity between Gatsby and me against everyone.</t3077>
<t3078>Dear Mr. Carraway:</t3078>
<t3079>This has been one of the most terrible blows of my life and I find it hard to believe it's true.</t3079> <t3080>An act as senseless as that man's should make us think.</t3080> <t3081>It is impossible for me to go at this moment because I am tied up with a very important matter and now I cannot get involved in that.</t3081> <t3082>If there is something I can do later, send me a letter with Edgar letting me know.</t3082> <t3083>I almost don't even know where I am when I hear something like this, and I feel totally devastated, knocked out.</t3083>
<t3084>Sincerely,</t3084>
<t3085>Meyer Wolfshiem</t3085>
<t3086>And he added hastily:</t3086>
<t3087>Keep me informed about the funeral, etc.</t3087> <t3088>I don't know his family.</t3088>
<t3089>When the phone rang that afternoon and the switchboard announced a long-distance call from Chicago, I thought it was finally Daisy.</t3089> <t3090>But a weak and distant man's voice reached me.</t3090>
<t3091>—Here Slagle...</t3091>
<t3092>—Yes? —that name didn't ring a bell.</t3092>
<t3093>—Shit merchandise.</t3093> <t3094>Did you receive my telegram?</t3094>
<t3095>—No telegram has arrived.</t3095>
<t3096>—Young Parker is in trouble.</t3096> <t3097>They caught him when he was trying to sell the bonds.</t3097> <t3098>They received a circular from New York with the numbers five minutes earlier.</t3098> <t3099>What do you say?</t3099> <t3100>One never knows what to expect in these backward cities...</t3100>
<t3101>—Listen —I interrupted him, choking—, listen, I am not Mr. Gatsby.</t3101> <t3102>Mr. Gatsby is dead.</t3102>
<t3103>There was a long silence on the other end of the line, followed by an exclamation, and immediately a dry squawk when the call was cut off.</t3103>
<t3104>I believe it was on the third day when a telegram arrived from a town in Minnesota, signed by Henry C. Gatz.</t3104> <t3105>It only said that the sender was leaving immediately for New York and that the funeral should be postponed until his arrival.</t3105>
<t3106>He was Gatsby's father, a solemn, desolate, and confused old man, who protected himself from the hot September day with a long, cheap coat.</t3106> <t3107>Tears kept welling up in his eyes from the emotion, and when I took his suitcase and hat, he started tugging at his sparse gray beard so insistently that I had trouble taking off his coat.</t3107> <t3108>He was about to collapse, so I took him to the music room and made him sit down while I ordered something for him to eat.</t3108> <t3109>But he couldn't eat, and the glass of milk spilled in his trembling hand.</t3109>
<t3110>—I saw the newspaper in Chicago —he said—.</t3110> <t3111>The Chicago newspaper covered everything.</t3111> <t3112>I came right away.</t3112>
<t3113>—I didn't know how to locate him.</t3113>
<t3114>Her eyes, which looked without seeing, incessantly scanned the room.</t3114>
<t3115>—He was crazy —he said—.</t3115> <t3116>He had to be crazy.</t3116>
<t3117>—Would you like some coffee? —I insisted.</t3117>
<t3118>—I don't want anything.</t3118> <t3119>I'm already fine, mister…</t3119>
<t3120>—Carraway.</t3120>
<t3121>—I'm fine now.</t3121> <t3122>Where have they put Jimmy?</t3122>
<t3123>I took him to the living room, where his son lay, and left him there.</t3123> <t3124>Some kids had climbed the steps and were peeking into the vestibule; when I told them who had just arrived, they left reluctantly.</t3124>
<t3125>Shortly after, Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth slightly open, his face slightly red, his eyes moist with some isolated and untimely tear.</t3125> <t3126>He had reached an age where death had lost its quality of terrible surprise and, when he then looked around and saw for the first time the height and splendor of the hall and the immense rooms that branched off from it and led to other rooms, his grief began to mix with a reverent pride.</t3126> <t3127>I helped him up to one of the bedrooms on the second floor; while he was taking off his jacket and vest, I told him that any arrangements had been postponed until his arrival.</t3127>
<t3128>—I didn't know what you were planning to do, Mister Gatsby…</t3128>
<t3129>—My name is Gatz.</t3129>
<t3130>—… Mister Gatz.</t3130> <t3131>I thought you might want to take your son back West.</t3131>
<t3132>He shook his head.</t3132>
<t3133>—Jimmy always liked the East more.</t3133> <t3134>He reached his position in the East.</t3134> <t3135>Were you a friend of my boy, mister…?</t3135>
<t3136>—We were close friends.</t3136>
<t3137>—He had a great future ahead of him, you know?</t3137> <t3138>He was just a boy, but he had brains…</t3138> <t3139>A lot of strength here…</t3139>
<t3140>He touched his head very seriously, and I nodded.</t3140>
<t3141>—If he had lived, he would have become a great man.</t3141> <t3142>A man like James J. Hill[23].</t3142> <t3143>He would have contributed to building up the country.</t3143>
<t3144>—That's true —I said, uncomfortable.</t3144>
<t3145>He tried to remove the embroidered quilt from the bed, lay down very straight, and fell asleep instantly.</t3145>
<t3146>That night, a person who could not hide their panic called on the phone and wanted to know who I was before telling me their name.</t3146>
<t3147>—Talk to Mr. Carraway —I told him.</t3147>
<t3148>—Ah —he sounded calmer—.</t3148> <t3149>I am Klipspringer.</t3149>
<t3150>I also felt more at ease because his call seemed to promise another friend for Gatsby's funeral.</t3150> <t3151>I didn't want to announce it in the newspapers and attract a crowd that would come as if to a show, so I made a few phone calls.</t3151> <t3152>It wasn't easy to find anyone.</t3152>
<t3153>—The funeral is tomorrow —I told Klipspringer—.</t3153> <t3154>At three, in the house.</t3154> <t3155>Notify everyone who might be interested…</t3155>
<t3156>—Ah, yes —he interrupted me—.</t3156> <t3157>I don't think I'll see anyone, but I'll do it if I get the chance.</t3157>
<t3158>His tone made me suspicious.</t3158>
<t3159>—You will come, of course.</t3159>
<t3160>—Well, I'll try, yes.</t3160> <t3161>The reason I was calling was because...</t3161>
<t3162>—Wait a moment —I interrupted him—.</t3162> <t3163>Will he come or not?</t3163>
<t3164>—Well, the fact is that...</t3164> <t3165>The truth is that I'm with some people in Greenwich, and they want me to spend the day with them tomorrow.</t3165> <t3166>There's a picnic or something like that.</t3166> <t3167>But yes, I'll do my best to get away.</t3167>
<t3168>I couldn't hold back a "yeah, right" and he must have heard me because he continued, nervously:</t3168>
<t3169>—Well, I called because I left a pair of shoes there.</t3169> <t3170>I don't know if it would be too much trouble to send them to me with the butler.</t3170> <t3171>They are tennis shoes and I feel quite helpless without them.</t3171> <t3172>My address is B. F….</t3172>
<t3173>I didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up.</t3173>
<t3174>After that, I felt a certain shame for Gatsby: a gentleman I called on the phone insinuated that he had gotten what he deserved.</t3174> <t3175>The fault was mine, because I was one of those who, emboldened by Gatsby's liquor, used to speak of Gatsby with more disdain, and I should have been smart enough not to call him.</t3175>
<t3176>The morning of the funeral I went to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; there seemed to be no other way to locate him.</t3176> <t3177>On the door that I opened, following the elevator operator's instructions, there was a sign that read The Swastika Holding Company, and at first, I thought there was no one there.</t3177> <t3178>But, after shouting "Good morning" in vain several times, an argument started in the adjoining room and soon a very attractive Jewish woman appeared at an interior door and examined me with black, hostile eyes.</t3178>
<t3179>—There is no one —he said—.</t3179> <t3180>Mr. Wolfshiem has gone to Chicago.</t3180>
<t3181>The first thing was evidently false, because inside someone had started whistling out of tune The rosary[24].</t3181>
<t3182>—Please do me the favor of telling him that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.</t3182>
<t3183>—Am I going to look for him in Chicago?</t3183>
<t3184>At that moment a voice, unmistakably that of Mr. Wolfshiem, shouted "Estella!" from the other side of the door.</t3184>
<t3185>—Leave your name on the table —she said—.</t3185> <t3186>I will give him the message as soon as he returns.</t3186>
<t3187>—But I know it's here.</t3187>
<t3188>He took a step towards me and started running his hands up and down his hips.</t3188>
<t3189>—You young people think you can come in here whenever you feel like it —he scolded me—.</t3189> <t3190>And we're fed up with it, to the point of nausea.</t3190> <t3191>When I say he's in Chicago, he's in Chicago.</t3191>
<t3192>I mentioned Gatsby.</t3192>
<t3193>—Ah —he looked at me again—.</t3193> <t3194>Could you… repeat your name for me?</t3194>
<t3195>He vanished.</t3195> <t3196>At that moment, Meyer Wolfshiem solemnly appeared at the door, extending both hands to me.</t3196> <t3197>He led me into his office while commenting in a reverent voice that it was a very sad time for all of us, and he offered me a cigar.</t3197>
<t3198>—Memory takes me back to the day I met him —he said—.</t3198> <t3199>A major, very young, recently discharged and covered in medals he had won in the war.</t3199> <t3200>He didn't have a cent: he kept wearing the uniform because he didn't have money to buy clothes.</t3200> <t3201>I saw him for the first time at Winebrenner's billiards, on Forty-third Street, where he came in to ask for a job.</t3201> <t3202>He hadn't eaten for two days.</t3202> <t3203>«Come have lunch with me», I said to him.</t3203> <t3204>He devoured more than four dollars' worth of food in half an hour.</t3204>
<t3205>—Did you introduce him to the business?</t3205>
<t3206>—Introduce him!</t3206> <t3207>I made him a businessman.</t3207>
<t3208>—Ah.</t3208>
<t3209>—I pulled him out of nowhere, straight from the gutter.</t3209> <t3210>I immediately realized he was a young man with good looks and a gentlemanly air, and when he told me he had been at Oggsford, I knew he could be very useful to me.</t3210> <t3211>I advised him to join the American Legion, where he was highly regarded.</t3211> <t3212>He then did a job for one of my clients in Albany.</t3212> <t3213>We were this close —he raised two bulbous fingers—, always together.</t3213>
<t3214>I wondered if that society had included the operation of Major League Baseball in 1919.</t3214>
<t3215>—And now he is dead —he said after a few seconds—.</t3215> <t3216>You were his closest friend, so I know you want me to go to the funeral this afternoon.</t3216> <t3217>I would like to go.</t3217>
<t3218>—Very well, then come.</t3218>
<t3219>The hairs in his nostrils vibrated slightly and, while shaking his head, his eyes filled with tears.</t3219>
<t3220>—I can't…</t3220> <t3221>I can't get involved in that —he said.</t3221>
<t3222>—There is nothing to get involved in.</t3222> <t3223>Everything is already over.</t3223>
<t3224>—When they kill a man, I don't like to get involved.</t3224> <t3225>I stay on the sidelines.</t3225> <t3226>When I was young, it was different: if a friend died, no matter how, I stayed by their side until the end.</t3226> <t3227>It may seem sentimental to you, but I'm serious: until the end, no matter how bitter it was.</t3227>
<t3228>I saw that, for some particular reason, he had decided not to attend the funeral, so I stood up.</t3228>
<t3229>—Have you been to university? —he asked suddenly.</t3229>
<t3230>For a moment, I thought he was going to propose a "coneggsion" to me, but he just nodded and shook my hand.</t3230>
<t3231>—We have to learn to show our friendship to a man when he is alive and not after he is dead —he suggested—.</t3231> <t3232>Afterwards, my rule is not to move things.</t3232>
<t3233>When I left the office, the sky had darkened, and it was drizzling as I arrived at West Egg.</t3233> <t3234>I changed clothes, went over to the neighboring house, and found Mr. Gatz walking around the foyer, excited.</t3234> <t3235>The pride for his son and his son's possessions had not stopped growing, and he wanted to show me something.</t3235>
<t3236>—Jimmy sent me this photo —he took out the wallet with trembling fingers—.</t3236> <t3237>Look.</t3237>
<t3238>It was a photograph of the house, torn at the corners and dirty from many hands.</t3238> <t3239>He pointed out every detail with fervor.</t3239> <t3240>«Look at this!», and he sought admiration in my eyes.</t3240> <t3241>He had shown it so many times that I believe it was more real to him than the house itself.</t3241>
<t3242>—Jimmy sent it to me.</t3242> <t3243>I think it's a very good photo.</t3243> <t3244>Everything looks great in it.</t3244>
<t3245>—Yes, very well.</t3245> <t3246>Had you seen your son lately?</t3246>
<t3247>—He came to see me two years ago and bought me the house where I live now.</t3247> <t3248>He left us devastated when he ran away from home, but now I see he had reasons to do it.</t3248> <t3249>I knew he had a great future ahead of him.</t3249> <t3250>And as soon as he started to succeed, he was very generous with me.</t3250>
<t3251>It seemed to resist putting the photo away and let me see it for a few more seconds.</t3251> <t3252>Then he put away the wallet and took out of his pocket a very old, grimy, and unbound copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy[25].</t3252>
<t3253>—Look, this book was his, from when he was a little boy.</t3253> <t3254>Now you'll see.</t3254>
<t3255>He opened it from the end and turned it around so I could see it.</t3255> <t3256>On the flyleaf, they had written the word SCHEDULE in block letters and the date, September 12, 1906.</t3256> <t3257>And below:</t3257>
<t3258>Wake up 6:00</t3258>
<t3259>Gymnastics and weights 6. 15-6.</t3259> <t3260>30</t3260>

<t3281>—I found this book by chance —said the old man—.</t3281> <t3282>Isn't it revealing?</t3282>
<t3283>—It's revealing.</t3283>
<t3284>—Jimmy was destined to succeed.</t3284> <t3285>He was always setting goals like that.</t3285> <t3286>Do you realize how much he cared about cultivating his intelligence?</t3286> <t3287>In that, he was exemplary.</t3287> <t3288>Once he told me that I ate like a pig, and I hit him.</t3288>
<t3289>He resisted closing the book, reading each line aloud and looking at me anxiously.</t3289> <t3290>I think he even expected me to copy the list for my own use.</t3290>
<t3291>Shortly before three, the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look out the windows involuntarily to see if more cars would appear.</t3291> <t3292>Gatsby's father did the same.</t3292> <t3293>And, as time passed, when the servants were already waiting in the vestibule, he began to blink nervously and talk about the rain with concern and uncertainty.</t3293> <t3294>The minister looked at his watch a couple of times, so I took him aside and asked him to wait half an hour.</t3294> <t3295>But it was useless.</t3295> <t3296>No one came.</t3296>
<t3297>Around five o'clock, our procession of three cars arrived at the cemetery and stopped at the entrance under a persistent drizzle: first the hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz, the minister, and I in the limousine, and very shortly after, in Gatsby's van, four or five servants and the West Egg postman, all soaked to the bone.</t3297> <t3298>As we were entering the cemetery, I heard a car stop and the sound of someone splashing in the wet ground behind us.</t3298> <t3299>I turned to look.</t3299> <t3300>It was the man with owl-like glasses whom I had discovered one night, three months ago, marveling at the books in Gatsby's library.</t3300>
<t3301>I hadn't seen him since then.</t3301> <t3302>I don't know how he found out about the burial, I don't even know his name.</t3302> <t3303>The rain ran down his very thick glasses, and he took them off and dried them to see how they lifted the tarp that protected Gatsby's grave.</t3303>
<t3304>I tried to think about Gatsby for a moment, but he was already too far away, and the only thing I could remember, without resentment, was that Daisy had not sent a message or a single flower.</t3304> <t3305>I barely heard a vague murmur: "Blessed are the dead upon whom the rain falls."</t3305> <t3306>And the man with owl eyes answered forcefully: "Amen."</t3306>
<t3307>We hurried back to the cars, under the rain.</t3307> <t3308>Owl Eyes spoke with me at the door:</t3308>
<t3309>—I couldn't go to the house.</t3309>
<t3310>—No one has been able to go.</t3310>
<t3311>—Don't tell me! —he burst out—.</t3311> <t3312>My God! They were going hundreds.</t3312>
<t3313>He took off his glasses and cleaned them again, inside and out.</t3313>
<t3314>—The poor son of a bitch —he said.</t3314>
<t3315>One of my most vivid memories is the return to the West from school and, later, from university during Christmas.</t3315>
<t3316>Those who continued their journey beyond Chicago gathered at the old Union Station at six on a December evening with some friends from Chicago who, already immersed in the holiday cheer, came to see them off.</t3316> <t3317>I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss So-and-So's school, and the conversations amidst the frosty breath, and the hands raised in greeting when we saw old friends, and how we compared our invitation lists, "Are you going to the Ordways', the Herseys', the Schultzes' party?"</t3317> <t3318>And the train tickets, long and green, tightly held in gloved hands.</t3318> <t3319>And, finally, on the track, near the entrance, the gloomy carriages of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and Saint Paul line, which seemed as cheerful to us as Christmas itself.</t3319>
<t3320>When we ventured into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to spread everywhere and to twinkle and crash against the train windows, and the dim lights of the small Wisconsin stations passed by, the air suddenly hardened, sharp and cutting.</t3320> <t3321>We inhaled it deeply when we returned from dinner across the frozen platforms, inconceivably aware for an extraordinary hour of our identification with the country, before joining and blending with it once again.</t3321>
<t3322>That was my Midwest, not the wheat or the prairies or the lost towns of the Swedes, but the thrilling trains of my youth on which I returned, and the street lamps and the sleigh bells in the frosty darkness and the shadows of the holly wreaths that the lit windows cast upon the snow.</t3322> <t3323>I am part of that world, a bit solemn due to the feeling of those long winters, a bit proud for having grown up in the Carraway house, in a town where houses are still known for decades by the name of the family that owns them.</t3323> <t3324>Now I understand that, after all, this story has been a story of the West: Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I are from the West, and perhaps we suffer in common from some deficiency that makes us subtly unadaptable to life in the East.</t3324>
<t3325>Even when the East impressed me more, even when I was more aware of its superiority over the boring, soulless, and sluggish cities beyond Ohio, with their inquisitive and endless snooping from which only children and the very elderly are spared, even then the East had a note of distortion for me.</t3325> <t3326>West Egg, especially, continues to appear in my most fantastic dreams.</t3326> <t3327>I see it as a nocturnal scene painted by El Greco: a hundred houses, both conventional and grotesque, huddled under a sullen and oppressive sky and a lusterless moon.</t3327> <t3328>In the foreground, four solemn men, dressed in formal attire, walk along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in an evening gown.</t3328> <t3329>The hand, hanging to one side, sparkles jeweled and cold.</t3329> <t3330>Very serious, the men enter a house, a wrong house.</t3330> <t3331>But no one knows the woman's name, nor does anyone care.</t3331>
<t3332>After Gatsby's death, the East seemed enchanted, distorted, beyond my eyes' ability to correct it.</t3332> <t3333>So, when the smoke from the dry leaves was already floating in the air and the damp clothes began to freeze on the clotheslines at the breath of the wind, I decided to return home.</t3333>
<t3334>There was something I had to do before I left, something unpleasant and embarrassing that probably would have been better left undone.</t3334> <t3335>But I wanted to leave everything in order and not rely on the indifferent and diligent sea to take away my trash.</t3335> <t3336>I saw Jordan Baker and talked about what had happened between us, and what had happened to me afterward, and she listened to me, very still, in a large armchair.</t3336>
<t3337>She was dressed like a golfer, and I remember thinking that she looked like a good picture for an illustrated magazine, with her chin gracefully raised, hair the color of autumn leaves, and her face the same tanned tone as the fingerless glove resting on her knee.</t3337> <t3338>When I finished, she told me without further comment that she had gotten engaged to someone else.</t3338> <t3339>I didn't quite believe it, although there were several with whom she could have married with a simple nod, but I pretended to be surprised.</t3339> <t3340>For a moment I wondered if I might be mistaken, then I quickly thought it all over again and stood up to say goodbye.</t3340>
<t3341>—But you were the one who left me —said Jordan suddenly—.</t3341> <t3342>You left me over the phone.</t3342> <t3343>You no longer matter to me in the slightest, but that was a new experience for me, and for a while, I felt a bit disoriented.</t3343>
<t3344>We shook hands.</t3344>
<t3345>—Ah, do you remember —he added— a conversation we had once about driving a car?</t3345>
<t3346>—No, I don't remember.</t3346>
<t3347>—Didn't you say that a bad driver is only safe until they meet another bad driver?</t3347> <t3348>Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I?</t3348> <t3349>I mean, if I made so many mistakes, it was due to my own carelessness.</t3349> <t3350>I thought you were a pretty honest and sincere person.</t3350> <t3351>I thought that was your secret pride.</t3351>
<t3352>—I am thirty years old —I said—.</t3352> <t3353>I have surpassed by five years the age of lying to myself and calling it honor.</t3353>
<t3354>She didn't answer me.</t3354> <t3355>Angry, half in love with her and tremendously hurt, I turned around and left.</t3355>
<t3356>One late October afternoon, I saw Tom Buchanan.</t3356> <t3357>He was walking ahead of me on Fifth Avenue, alert and aggressive as always, his hands slightly away from his body as if to fend off any intrusion, and jerking his head in rhythm with his restless eyes.</t3357> <t3358>At the moment I slowed down to avoid overtaking him, he stopped to look, frowning, at a jewelry store window.</t3358> <t3359>Then he saw me and stepped back, extending his hand to me.</t3359>
<t3360>—What's wrong, Nick?</t3360> <t3361>Are you refusing to shake my hand?</t3361>
<t3362>—Yes.</t3362> <t3363>You know what I think of you.</t3363>
<t3364>—You're crazy, Nick —he said—.</t3364> <t3365>Completely crazy.</t3365> <t3366>I don't know what's wrong with you.</t3366>
<t3367>—Tom —I asked—, what did you say to Wilson that day?</t3367>
<t3368>He looked at me without saying a word, and I knew I hadn't been mistaken about those lost hours.</t3368> <t3369>I tried to turn around, but he grabbed my arm.</t3369>
<t3370>—I told him the truth —he said—.</t3370> <t3371>He showed up at the door when we were about to leave and, when I ordered them to say we weren't there, he tried to force his way in.</t3371> <t3372>He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car.</t3372> <t3373>In the house, he didn't let go of the revolver he had in his pocket for a moment —he paused, defiantly—.</t3373> <t3374>So what if I told him?</t3374> <t3375>That guy got what he deserved.</t3375> <t3376>He blinded you just like he blinded Daisy, but he was dangerous.</t3376> <t3377>He ran over Myrtle like someone runs over a dog, and he didn't even stop.</t3377>
<t3378>There was nothing I could respond to him, except the unspeakable: that it wasn't true.</t3378>
<t3379>—And if you think I haven't had my share of suffering...</t3379> <t3380>Look, when I went to leave the apartment and saw the damn box of dog biscuits on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a child, my God, it was terrible...</t3380>
<t3381>I couldn't forgive him or show him sympathy, but I understood that, for him, what he had done was completely justified.</t3381> <t3382>It was only inconsideration and confusion: Tom and Daisy were inconsiderate people.</t3382> <t3383>They destroyed things and people and then hid behind their money or their immense inconsideration, or whatever it was that united them, and left others to clean up the mess they made...</t3383>
<t3384>I shook his hand; it seemed absurd not to do so, because suddenly it was as if I were talking to a child.</t3384> <t3385>Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace —or perhaps some cufflinks—, forever free from my provincial scruples.</t3385>
<t3386>Gatsby's house remained empty when I left: its lawn had grown as much as mine.</t3386> <t3387>One of the town's taxi drivers never passed by the entrance without stopping for a moment to point out the house to his passengers; he might have been the one who took Daisy and Gatsby to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had invented his own story about the case.</t3387> <t3388>I didn't want to hear it and avoided him when I got off the train.</t3388>
<t3389>I spent Saturday nights in New York because those dazzling parties were still so alive in me that I could still hear the music and the endless, faint laughter coming from the gardens of the house, and the cars going up and down the driveway.</t3389> <t3390>One night I heard a real car, and I saw how the headlights illuminated the staircase.</t3390> <t3391>But I did not investigate.</t3391> <t3392>It must have been some late guest who had been at the ends of the earth and did not know that the party was over.</t3392>
<t3393>The last night, after packing and selling the car to the grocery store owner, I went to see once again that extraordinary and incoherent house disaster.</t3393> <t3394>On the white steps, an obscene word, scribbled by some kid with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, rubbing the stone with my shoe.</t3394> <t3395>Then I walked down to the beach and lay down on the sand.</t3395>
<t3396>The majority of the large beach houses were already closed, and hardly any light could be seen except for the moving and cloudy glow of some ferry crossing the strait.</t3396> <t3397>And, as the moon rose higher, the insubstantial houses began to fade, and little by little I became aware of the old island that had once blossomed right there before the eyes of a few Dutch sailors: a breast of the new world, green and young.</t3397> <t3398>Trees that had disappeared, the trees that would give way to Gatsby's house, once provoked with their whispers the last and greatest of human dreams: for an enchanted and fleeting moment, man had to hold his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled to an aesthetic contemplation that he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something proportional to his capacity for wonder.</t3398>
<t3399>And there, thinking about the old unknown world, I remembered Gatsby's amazement when he discovered the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.</t3399> <t3400>He had come a long way to that blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that it could hardly escape him.</t3400> <t3401>He did not know that he had already left it behind, somewhere, beyond the city, in the vast darkness, where the dark fields of the republic stretch out into the night.</t3401>
<t3402>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us.</t3402> <t3403>It eludes us now, but no matter, tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... </t3403> <t3404>And one fine morning...</t3404>
<t3405>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</t3405>
<t3406>END</t3406>
<t3407>EPILOGUE: THE MIRRORS OF GATSB</t3407><t3408>AND</t3408>
<t3409>Francis Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby on the French Riviera in 1924 and revised it in Rome and Capri.</t3409> <t3410>“I have written the best novel of the United States,” he then told his editor, Maxwell Perkins.</t3410> <t3411>The myth of Gatsby is the myth of the man from the cities, an ordinary one, the one we meet one day by chance and will never know exactly who he is or where he came from.</t3411> <t3412>Gatsby is an emblem of the citizen: essentially he will be the idea that others have of him, murderer or prince, hero or antihero, an extraordinary being who shines at his magnificent parties, mysterious and suspicious, Mister Nobody from Nowhere.</t3412>
<t3413>Everything that appears in The Great Gatsby is something that someone has seen and recounts later: the hero's childhood and early youth, the heroine's loves and wedding, the reconstruction of the final crime based on the witnesses' statements, Jay Gatsby's last summer, remembered two years after the events by Nick Carraway.</t3413> <t3414>Everything is true, except what the protagonist tells about himself to introduce himself to his new friend, Carraway, the narrator, who, although he boasts of not judging anyone, will judge Gatsby and deliver his verdict before the story ends.</t3414> <t3415>The city dweller is what others see in him.</t3415>
<t3416>In the summer of 1922, to be seen and to win back lost love, Gatsby organizes extraordinary parties in his extraordinary house.</t3416> <t3417>The entire novel is a succession of parties and gatherings to eat and drink.</t3417> <t3418>"The greatest orgy in history," is what Francis Scott Fitzgerald called the twenties of the last century, when he was in his twenties.</t3418> <t3419>But these amusements end in disturbance and lead to violence.</t3419> <t3420>Fitzgerald said he wanted to write something beautiful and simple, yet with a complex structure, and he devised a perfect game of parallel lives and mirror figures, starting with the hero, Gatsby, and the chronicler of his deeds, Carraway, two displaced individuals, two immigrants, who arrived in New York from the West to prosper in the businesses of the time, financial speculation or liquor smuggling.</t3420>
<t3421>Both of them show airs of grandeur when they talk about themselves.</t3421> <t3422>If Gatsby presents himself as a descendant of a wealthy, extinct family, a world traveler, a big-game hunter, a jewelry collector, and a war hero with a broken heart, Carraway, who hasn't read as much cheap literature, only boasts of being honest and possibly descending from some English dukes, even though his family has been in the wholesale hardware business all their lives.</t3422> <t3423>Gatsby loses his head for love, but Carraway falls in love so routinely that he gets bored and disillusioned along the way.</t3423> <t3424>The narrator lives in a house worse than ugly, bland, just a few meters from where Gatsby shines.</t3424> <t3425>Both are dazzled by the rich, the brutal Tom Buchanan and the luminous Daisy.</t3425>
<t3426>The game of mirrors continues: the golden and radiant couple will cross paths with the miserable marriage of George and Myrtle Wilson.</t3426> <t3427>The popular magazine Liberty refused to publish The Great Gatsby in installments, considering it an immoral story of lovers and adulterers.</t3427> <t3428>Both Gatsby and Buchanan pursue other men's women, two women with decorative names, of flowers, the daisy and the myrtle, Daisy and Myrtle.</t3428> <t3429>The betrayed spouses are antithetical, the ashen George Wilson and the imposing Tom Buchanan; the clandestine lovers, Gatsby and Myrtle, share the capacity for illusion, the dream of another possible life; Gatsby wants to return to the past, reclaiming Daisy's love; Myrtle, who spends the afternoon with Buchanan and will end up with a broken nose, thinks about the future: she wants to buy a dog collar, an ashtray that automatically swallows the ash, and a wreath for her mother's grave.</t3429>
<t3430>Gatsby throws his parties to attract the butterfly Daisy to the light of his gardens, enlivened by the fashionable orchestra.</t3430> <t3431>His house is a fair, a circus, an amusement park where perhaps the most spectacular thing is the legend of the circus owner, a probable murderer, spy, traitor, or nephew of the Emperor of Germany, a story taken from a sensationalist magazine or a tale by the most esteemed popular storyteller of the time, Francis Scott Fitzgerald.</t3431> <t3432>War hero, above everyone from the top of the staircase of his house, he looks at his useless and ephemeral world.</t3432> <t3433>Then the bells ring and the narrator, Carraway, recalls the risky list of guests at Gatsby's balls, which sounds like the list of the dead that Jorge Manrique recited in the Coplas on the Death of His Father.</t3433>
<t3434>But the true story of Gatsby is more exciting than all his tales.</t3434> <t3435>It seems like an autobiography of Fitzgerald, who was born in Minnesota like Gatsby, trained like Gatsby at a camp near Louisville, Camp Taylor, and ended up stationed at a camp in Alabama, where he fell in love with his future wife, Zelda Sayre, just as Gatsby fell in love with Daisy Fay.</t3435> <t3436>Fitzgerald had a painful sense of time irretrievably gone, and Gatsby thought he could resurrect the dead time, the past, and even more, a single and privileged moment of the past.</t3436> <t3437>Gatsby is the negative of Tom and Daisy Buchanan, who base their splendor on inheritance, family, and the ever-renewed wealth of their ancestors: Jay Gatsby invented his name, fled from his parents, from his family and personal history, liquidated his past to recover the past or, better yet, the dreamed past, faithful only to his own dreams, with the courage or recklessness sufficient to believe himself capable of realizing them.</t3437>
<t3438>He is a tragic hero: the very steps he takes towards his fulfillment and happiness lead him to destruction.</t3438> <t3439>The final act begins to the chords of a wedding march coming from a ballroom, as if Tom and Daisy's wedding were being renewed at the moment when Gatsby believed he was winning her back.</t3439> <t3440>Gatsby and Myrtle, the two poor impossible lovers, end up sacrificed in the same game of chance: Myrtle, a martyr kneeling on the road with a torn chest, and Gatsby, in a purifying and baptismal pool, two lower-class individuals, innocent, immoral, and reckless, crushed in the path of the Buchanan marriage.</t3440> <t3441>Francis Scott Fitzgerald, a Catholic boy, seems to have retained a mythical and perhaps unconscious memory of the painful imagery of his religion.</t3441>
<t3442>He had the genius to perceive a mythical universe in a historical time, the 1920s in the United States of America.</t3442> <t3443>The characters in The Great Gatsby read the books that were successful then and dance to the rhythm of the popular songs in the world that emerged from the First World War, the world of financial speculation and corruption, the first great automobile fever, the age of jazz and endless parties and everyday violence, on the eve of the great economic depression of 1929.</t3443> <t3444>Fitzgerald's imaginative daring culminates when he compares Gatsby's dazzlement at his dream of Daisy to the impression of the first Dutch settlers who arrived in Long Island in the 17th century in search of a new world and a new life: as if Gatsby were the embodiment of the original American, without a past, forged by his own will, a son of himself like God, free, with no limits on his right to be happy.</t3444>
