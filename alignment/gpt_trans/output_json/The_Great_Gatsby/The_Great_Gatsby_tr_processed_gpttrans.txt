<t0>CHAPTER 1</t0>
<t1>When I was younger and more fragile, my father gave me a piece of advice that I will never forget for the rest of my life.</t1>
<t2>“When you feel like criticizing someone,” he said, “remember that not everyone has had the advantages that you’ve had.</t2><t3>”</t3>
<t4>He hadn't said anything else, but since we understood each other without much talking, I realized he wanted to convey much more.</t4><t5>As a result, I preferred to keep my judgments about people to myself.</t5><t6>This habit allowed me to meet many peculiar individuals, but it also condemned me to a considerable number of annoying people.</t6><t7>Those who think differently immediately recognize this trait in a normal person and quickly become attached to it.</t7><t8>While I was in university, for this very reason, that is, because some crazy, unknown young people did not hesitate to tell me their secrets, I was accused of being overly political for no reason.</t8><t9>However, I often did this unintentionally.</t9><t10>The moment I sensed someone was about to confide in me, depending on the situation, I would either pretend to be asleep, act as if I were very busy, or dismiss them with a joke.</t10><t11>Because these intimate revelations of young people, or at least the expressions they use to tell them, are usually either borrowed from here and there or are suppressed emotions.</t11><t12>Keeping judgments about people to oneself is, in my opinion, an endless hope.</t12><t13>I still fear forgetting this saying of my father's, which he uttered wisely and I wisely agreed with: some fundamental subtleties are unjustly distributed in the world.</t13>
<t14>After boasting so much about my tolerance, I must admit that it has its limits.</t14> <t15>There may be a hard rock or a swamp beneath human behaviors, but after a certain point, I can't say that I care much.</t15> <t16>When I returned from the east of the country last fall, I realized that I wanted the world to be an example and for honor to reign supreme forever.</t16> <t17>I no longer wanted those uneasy excursions into the privileged views of people's hearts.</t17> <t18>I exclude only one person from this, Gatsby, who also gives his name to this book.</t18> <t19>Gatsby, the person who embodies everything I despise.</t19> <t20>If a series of successful gestures is a sign of personality, Gatsby had something magnificent, an exaggerated sensitivity to life's promises.</t20> <t21>He was like those complex devices that can record earthquakes thousands of miles away.</t21> <t22>But this had nothing to do with that loose sensitivity glorified under the name of "creative temperament."</t22> <t23>His was an extraordinary ability to hope, a romantic madness that I had never seen before and don't think I will ever see again.</t23> <t24>No - Gatsby ultimately achieved his desire.</t24> <t25>It was what caught Gatsby off guard, what covered him in ash and dust when he awoke from his dreams, that caused my interest in the futile sorrows and short-lived happiness of people to disappear for a while.</t25>
<t26>My family consists of wealthy and respectable people who have lived in this Midwestern city for three generations.</t26> <t27>We Carraways are like a kind of clan.</t27> <t28>It is rumored that we are descended from the Duke of Buccleuch.</t28> <t29>But the real person who laid the foundation of our lineage is my grandfather's brother.</t29> <t30>After joining the Civil War as a reinforcement force, he settled here in '51 and established the wholesale hardware business that my father now continues.</t30>
<t31>I never met this great uncle, but those who saw the sharp-featured portrait hanging in my father's workplace said I resembled him a lot.</t31> <t32>In 1915, exactly a quarter-century after my father, I graduated from New Haven.</t32> <t33>Soon after, I joined the delayed German expansion movement known to the world as the Great War (World War I).</t33> <t34>Our counterattacks gave me such great pleasure that I was saddened to return.</t34> <t35>The Midwest had ceased to be a bustling center of the world and had turned into a remote corner of the universe.</t35> <t36>So I decided to go East and get into the bond business.</t36> <t37>Everyone I knew was doing this job, and I thought that a bachelor like me could easily make a living this way.</t37> <t38>After all the aunts, uncles, and cousins had long discussions on the subject as if they were choosing a suitable college for me, they said "Alright" with serious and concerned faces.</t38> <t39>My father agreed to send me money for a year, and after a few delays, I finally came East and settled permanently in the spring of 1922.</t39>
<t40>The first thing to do was to rent a room in the city center, but the season was mild and I had just come from a region with vast meadows and friendly trees.</t40> <t41>When a young boy from work suggested renting a house in one of the nearby suburbs, it seemed like a great idea to me.</t41> <t42>He found the house.</t42> <t43>For eighty dollars a month, it was a damp-worn, shabby building.</t43> <t44>When the company sent him to Washington at the last minute, the house was left to me.</t44> <t45>I got a dog, but it ran away a few days later.</t45> <t46>I had an old Dodge car and a Finnish helper who made my bed and prepared my breakfast.</t46> <t47>She would sit by the electric heater, murmuring something in her own language.</t47>
<t48>I spent a couple of days alone like this.</t48> <t49>Then one morning, a man who apparently had arrived shortly after me stopped me and asked with a bewildered expression on his face, "How can I get to the village of West Egg?"</t49>
<t50>I showed how to get there.</t50> <t51>When I started walking again, I had the feeling that I was no longer alone.</t51> <t52>I was a guide, one of the locals, giving directions to those around.</t52> <t53>Unknowingly, he had granted me the freedom of being his neighbor.</t53>
<t54>I couldn't help but feel that familiar sense of life beginning anew with the arrival of summer, as the bright sunlight filled those trees with lush green leaves at a speed reminiscent of the movies.</t54>
<t55>There were a lot of things to read, but first, I needed to fill my lungs with this fresh, invigorating air and feel healthy.</t55><t56>I had placed a dozen books on banking, credit, and investment tools that I brought with me on the shelf.</t56><t57>As they waited in front of me with their red and gilded covers like freshly minted crisp money from the mint, I felt that men like Midas, Morgan, and Maecenas were preparing to reveal their secrets known only to themselves.</t57><t58>Of course, I would read other books as well.</t58><t59>I was interested in literature when I was at university.</t59><t60>I had written serious and quality articles for a year in the school newspaper called Yale News.</t60><t61>Now I was preparing to bring all of this back into my life.</t61><t62>I would become one of those "versatile intellectuals" from the most restricted fields of expertise.</t62><t63>This is not just a satire.</t63><t64>Life seems much more visible to succeed when viewed from a single window.</t64>
<t65>It was entirely by chance that I rented a house in a region where the strangest people of North America lived.</t65> <t66>My house was on that narrow island extending east of New York, in the midst of chaos.</t66> <t67>Besides the strange natural landscapes here, there were two extraordinary terrestrial formations.</t67> <t68>About thirty kilometers away from the city center, a pair of gigantic eggs, identical to each other and separated only by a delicate bay, extending to Long Island Sound, the best cultivated saltwater region in the Western Hemisphere.</t68> <t69>They were not exactly oval.</t69> <t70>The points where both of them connected to the land were flattened, like the eggs in Columbus's story.</t70> <t71>There is no doubt that these gigantic eggs were a source of bewilderment for the seagulls flying over them.</t71> <t72>For us, the wingless ones, the dissimilarity of their features other than shape and size occupies the mind.</t72>
<t73>I lived in West Egg, the less fashionable of the two.</t73> <t74>Still, I think this description falls short in expressing the bizarre and ominous contrast between them.</t74> <t75>My house was at the very tip of the egg and only fifty meters from the Sound.</t75> <t76>It was squeezed between two huge houses that rented for twelve to fifteen thousand dollars a season.</t76> <t77>The one on the right was a colossal affair by any standard.</t77> <t78>It was a replica of the Hotel de Ville in Normandy.</t78> <t79>Beside the building, there was a tower covered with ivy, a marble swimming pool, and over twenty acres of lawn and garden.</t79> <t80>This was Gatsby's mansion.</t80> <t81>Since I didn't know him at the time, it would be more accurate to say a gentleman named Gatsby.</t81> <t82>My own house, which was an eyesore, didn't attract much attention.</t82> <t83>For a mere eighty dollars a month, I lived next to a millionaire, overlooking a small part of my wealthy neighbor's garden and the Sound.</t83>
<t84>Actually, the story of the summer began when I went to the Buchanans for dinner, accompanied by the white mansions stretching along the sea under the evening sun of East Egg on the opposite shore of the delicate bay.</t84> <t85>His wife Daisy was my second cousin.</t85> <t86>I knew Tom from university.</t86> <t87>I had stayed at their house in Chicago right after the war.</t87>
<t88>Daisy’s husband, in addition to many athletic achievements, was one of the best forwards to have ever played on the school team in New Haven.</t88> <t89>He was practically a national hero.</t89> <t90>By the age of twenty-one, he had achieved such magnificent successes that everything he did afterward was overshadowed by them.</t90> <t91>His family was extremely wealthy.</t91> <t92>He was criticized during his university years for having unlimited freedom when it came to money.</t92> <t93>But now he had left Chicago and come to the East.</t93> <t94>He did it in such a way that it took people's breath away.</t94> <t95>For example, he brought along a number of polo ponies from Lake Forest when he came.</t95> <t96>For my generation, it is hard to even imagine having the wealth to do such a thing.</t96>
<t97>I don't know the reasons for coming to the East.</t97> <t98>They had stayed in France for a year without any reason, wandering around places where rich people played polo.</t98> <t99>This time, Daisy had said on the phone that they were moving permanently.</t99> <t100>Still, I didn't believe it.</t100> <t101>I knew what was on Daisy's mind, but I felt that Tom would forever be in search, longing for the excitement of football.</t101>
<t102>Now, on a warm and windy evening, I was heading towards East Egg to see two old friends whom I didn't know very well.</t102> <t103>Their house had a more refined taste than I had expected.</t103> <t104>This mansion, built in Georgian Colonial architecture and painted in red and white, was situated on a height overlooking the bay.</t104> <t105>The green area in front extended from the seashore, advancing a few hundred meters to the main entrance door of the house.</t105> <t106>Along the way, it passed by occasional sundials, brick-paved walkways, and flower gardens glistening in the daylight, finally leaning against the wall covered with vines as if unable to stop when it reached the house.</t106> <t107>The glass of the French-style windows separating the front facade glowed golden in the sunlight, and the warm evening breeze flowed in through the open windows.</t107> <t108>Tom Buchanan, dressed in riding clothes, was waiting at the entrance to greet me.</t108>
<t109>New Haven had changed a lot since we last met.</t109> <t110>In front of me stood an arrogant man in his thirties, with bright blonde hair, looking down on others.</t110> <t111>His shining, insolent eyes spread a sense of dominance across his face, and his posture gave the impression that he was leaning forward in anger at something.</t111> <t112>Even the feminine appearance of his riding outfit couldn't hide the immense power of his body.</t112> <t113>His feet filled his shiny boots so much that the laces on top could barely be tied.</t113> <t114>When he moved his shoulders under his thin garment, the massive muscles beneath could be felt.</t114> <t115>It was a body full of great strength, and at the same time, cruel.</t115>
<t116>The husky tenor tone of his voice when he spoke further reinforced his fierce appearance.</t116> <t117>There were traces of a bullying disdain in his voice - even towards those he loved.</t117> <t118>I remembered that there were a lot of people in New Haven who hated him.</t118>
<t119>With that appearance, it was as if he was saying, "You don't actually need to accept that my ideas are superior just because I'm stronger than you."</t119> <t120>We were members of the same student club in our senior year of university.</t120> <t121>Even though we weren't very close, despite his stern and commanding demeanor, he acted as if he cared about me liking him.</t121>
<t122>We chatted for a few minutes on the sunny terrace.</t122>
<t123>"I made this place beautiful," he said while his sparkling eyes wandered around.</t123>
<t124>While he was guiding me by holding my arm with one hand, with his other broad, flat hand, he was pointing out the Italian-style garden sunk in the hollow, the fragrant roses in the half-acre area, and the upturned-nose motorboat bouncing on the waves a little off the shore.</t124>
<t125>As he said the sentence, "This land belongs to that oil tycoon Demaine," he turned me around by grabbing my arm and politely said, "Let's go inside."</t125>
<t126>We proceeded through a high-ceilinged, spacious hall and arrived at a bright, rose-colored room with French-style windows.</t126> <t127>The reflections of the slightly ajar windows were falling onto the fresh grass.</t127> <t128>The curtains were fluttering like pale flags with the breeze filling the room, sometimes rising towards the ceiling that resembled an ornate wedding cake, curling and twisting to create shadows on the wine-colored carpet like the wind rippling the sea.</t128>
<t129>The only motionless object in the living room was a majestic sofa on which two young women were moving about like buoys tied to an anchor.</t129> <t130>Both were dressed in white.</t130> <t131>Their delicate clothes seemed to flutter around the house and then settle where they were, trembling.</t131> <t132>I must have stood there for a while, listening to the whip-like sounds of the curtains and the moaning of the painting on the wall.</t132> <t133>Then Tom Buchanan noisily closed the back windows, and the breeze that filled the room died down inside.</t133> <t134>The curtains, the carpet, and the clothes of the two young women slowly became still.</t134>
<t135>I did not know the younger of the two women.</t135> <t136>She was lying at one end of the divan, staying completely still, holding her chin slightly up as if balancing something.</t136> <t137>Even if she was glancing at me from the corner of her eye, it was not noticeable.</t137> <t138>I was almost going to apologize for disturbing her by entering.</t138>
<t139>The other one, that is, Daisy, moved as if she was about to get up – slightly bending with a careful expression on her face – then she let out a strange but charming laugh.</t139> <t140>I laughed too and walked towards her.</t140>
<t141>“I froze in place from joy,” she said.</t141> <t142>Then she laughed again as if she had said something witty.</t142> <t143>While holding my hand, she was looking at my face as if I were the person she wanted to see most in the world.</t143> <t144>She was always like this.</t144> <t145>She leaned in a bit and whispered that the girl trying to balance something on her chin was named Baker.</t145> <t146>(I had heard that Daisy’s habit of whispering was to make people lean towards her.</t146> <t147>This unfounded criticism never diminished her charm, of course.</t147><t148>)</t148>
<t149>Somehow, Mrs. Baker's lips had moved.</t149> <t150>After greeting me with a barely perceptible motion, she threw her head back.</t150> <t151>The object she was trying to balance must have wobbled a bit, as she started slightly.</t151> <t152>I was about to apologize to her again.</t152> <t153>For some reason, I have always admired such self-sufficient people.</t153>
<t154>I turned again to my cousin, who was asking questions with his hoarse, trembling voice.</t154> <t155>It was a voice that one would follow its ups and downs as if listening to a melody they would never hear again, a melody that made people perk up their ears.</t155> <t156>His face was cute and sad, his sparkling eyes and sensual wet lips were noticeable, but what men who were interested in him could never forget was his voice that excited people.</t156> <t157>It was an enticing song, a promise that whispered "listen," suggesting that he had just done something enthusiastic and provocative, and that he would do something enthusiastic and provocative again within an hour.</t157>
<t158>I told him that I had stopped by Chicago for a day on my way here and that a dozen people had sent their regards to him.</t158>
<t159>“Did they miss me?” he asked excitedly.</t159>
<t160>"The city is in a miserable state.</t160> <t161>They have painted the left rear wheels of the cars black, as if in mourning.</t161> <t162>On the northern coast, the laments never cease.</t162><t163>"</t163>
<t164>"Great! Let's go back, Tom."</t164> <t165>“Right away, tomorrow!” Then, quite out of place, she suddenly said, "You should see the baby."</t165>
<t166>“I would love to.</t166><t167>”</t167>
<t168>“She is sleeping now.</t168> <t169>She turned three.</t169> <t170>Hadn't you seen her before?</t170><t171>”</t171>
<t172>"No.</t172><t173>"</t173>
<t174>"Then you absolutely must see it.</t174> <t175>He-"</t175>
<t176>Tom Buchanan, who was pacing restlessly inside the room, came up to me and put his hand on my shoulder.</t176>
<t177>“What do you do for a living, Nick?</t177><t178>”</t178>
<t179>“I am a stockbroker”</t179>
<t180>"Whose side are you on?</t180><t181>"</t181>
<t182>I told her.</t182>
<t183>"I've never heard of it," he said with a definitive tone.</t183>
<t184>This had bothered me a bit.</t184>
<t185>“You will hear,” I answered briefly.</t185> <t186>“of course, if you stay in the East.</t186><t187>”</t187>
<t188>“I will stay, don't worry,” he said first to Daisy, then looking at me.</t188> <t189>He seemed to be expecting an objection.</t189> <t190>“I'm not foolish enough to go somewhere else.</t190><t191>”</t191>
<t192>Just then, Mrs. Baker shouted "Absolutely!" so quickly that I was startled.</t192> <t193>It was the first time she had spoken since I entered the room.</t193> <t194>It was clear that she was at least as surprised as I was.</t194> <t195>She yawned and got up from her seat with a swift movement.</t195>
<t196>"I'm all stiff," she complained, "I don't remember how long I've been lying on this couch."</t196><t197></t197>
<t198>“Don’t look at me,” said Daisy, “I’ve been trying to take you to New York since morning.</t198> <t199>Miss Baker glanced at the four cocktail glasses brought from the kitchen and said, “No, I don’t want any, I’m training.</t199><t200>”</t200>
<t201>The landlord was quite skeptical,</t201>
<t202>“Is it you!” said Tom as he downed his glass, “I can never understand how you manage your affairs.</t202><t203>”</t203>
<t204>I looked at Bayan Baker, I was genuinely curious about what she had "handled".</t204> <t205>I enjoyed looking at her.</t205> <t206>She was thin, her breasts were small.</t206> <t207>She walked upright, throwing her shoulders back like a military school student.</t207> <t208>She looked at me with a polite expression on her pale face, her gray eyes dazzled by the sun.</t208> <t209>I thought I had seen her or her photograph somewhere.</t209>
<t210>“I suppose you live in West Egg,” he said with a disdainful expression.</t210> <t211>“I know someone who lives there.</t211><t212>”</t212>
<t213>“I didn't—”</t213>
<t214>“I'm sure you know Gatsby.”</t214><t215>”</t215>
<t216>“Which Gatsby?” asked Daisy.</t216> <t217>Before I had a chance to say he was my neighbor, it was announced that dinner was ready.</t217> <t218>Tom Buchanan, with a commanding demeanor, placed his tense arm under mine and moved me out of the room as if moving a pawn to another square on a chessboard.</t218>
<t219>Two young people, walking slowly with their hands on their hips, were moving towards the rose-colored terrace overlooking the sunset, with a delicate woman swaying ahead of us.</t219> <t220>The lightening wind was flickering the flames of the four candles on the table.</t220>
<t221>“What are these candles?” Daisy muttered, frowning.</t221> <t222>Then she pressed her fingers to the wick and extinguished the candles.</t222> <t223>“In two weeks, it will be the longest day of the year.”</t223> <t224>She looked at us cheerfully.</t224> <t225>“Do you also wait for the longest day and then miss it?</t225> <t226>I always wait, and I always miss it.</t226><t227>”</t227>
<t228>“We can do something together,” said Mrs. Baker, yawning as she sat in her chair as if she were sitting in her bed.</t228>
<t229>“Okay,” said Daisy.</t229> <t230>“So, what should we do?”</t230> <t231>She turned to me with a helpless expression.</t231> <t232>“I wonder what people would like to do?</t232><t233>”</t233>
<t234>Just as I was about to respond, he directed his gaze to his little finger.</t234>
<t235>"Look over there!" he complained; "I hurt my finger.</t235><t236>"</t236>
<t237>We all looked.</t237> <t238>Its joints were bruised.</t238>
<t239>“You did this, Tom,” she said accusingly.</t239> <t240>“Maybe you didn't do it on purpose, but you still did it.</t240> <t241>This is what happens when you marry a brute like you, a big clumsy oaf...</t241><t242>”</t242>
<t243>"I don't like that word," Tom burst out angrily, "even as a joke, don't say it."</t243><t244></t244>
<t245>“You are stubborn, but” insisted Daisy.</t245>
<t246>From time to time, he and Mrs. Baker would talk and joke simultaneously, jumping from one topic to another.</t246> <t247>Their conversation was as calm as their white clothes and languid eyes.</t247> <t248>They had accepted being here with Tom and me, and without much effort, they were both having fun and entertaining us.</t248> <t249>They knew that the meal would soon be over, the night would soon end, and everything would be left behind.</t249> <t250>This place was very different from the West.</t250> <t251>There, the evenings would rapidly progress towards their end, constantly filled with disappointing predictions or the alarming terror of the moment itself.</t251>
<t252>While drinking the second glass of a high-quality Bordeaux wine that had absorbed the smell of cork, I confessed, "You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," "at least talk about cereals or something to complete the picture!</t252><t253>"</t253>
<t254>I didn't say this with a specific purpose, but I encountered a reaction I never expected.</t254>
<t255>“Civilization is collapsing,” Tom shouted angrily, “I am very pessimistic about this matter now.</t255> <t256>Have you read the book called The Rise of the Colored Empires by that man named Goddard?</t256><t257>”</t257>
<t258>"No, I haven't read it," I said, the tone of my voice surprising me.</t258>
<t259>“A very good book, everyone should read it.</t259> <t260>It argues that if we are not careful, the white race – you heard it right, the white race – will disappear.</t260> <t261>It is quite a scientific book, providing evidence for everything it claims.</t261><t262>”</t262>
<t263>“Tom has started getting into deep subjects,” said Daisy with a careless sorrow, “He’s reading quite deep books with long sentences in them.</t263> <t264>What was it called, um...</t264><t265>”</t265>
<t266>“Whatever! Those books are entirely scientific,” said Tom impatiently, “The man has figured out the issue well.</t266> <t267>Everything depends on us, the dominant race.</t267> <t268>Either we are careful, or we fall under the hegemony of other races.”</t268>
<t269>"We need to defeat them," whispered Daisy, blinking her eyes as she looked directly at the sun's rays.</t269>
<t270>Bayan Baker had started by saying, "You have to live in California," but Tom interrupted her noisily, shifting in his seat, "According to this view, we are all of Norman descent.</t270> <t271>Me, you, you and..." he paused for a moment and slightly bowed his head to include his wife, at which point Daisy winked at me once again "...</t271> <t272>we have created everything that constitutes civilization.</t272> <t273>Science, art, and the others, do you understand?</t273><t274>"</t274>
<t275>There was a tragic aspect in his being so carried away.</t275> <t276>His arrogance, which had always been excessive, seemed no longer sufficient for him.</t276> <t277>Just then, when the phone rang and the servant entered, Daisy took advantage of the opportunity to lean towards me.</t277>
<t278>"Let me tell you a family secret," he said in a low voice, "You know our servant's nose, right? Would you like to hear its story?</t278><t279>"</t279>
<t280>“That's why I came here anyway.</t280><t281>”</t281>
<t282>He was a silver polisher at a company in New York with two hundred regular customers.</t282> <t283>Polishing silver from morning till night eventually started to damage his nose.</t283>
<t284>“And his condition has been getting worse,” Mrs. Baker interjected.</t284>
<t285>“Yes.</t285> <t286>It had gotten so bad that he finally had to quit his job.</t286><t287>”</t287>
<t288>The last rays of the setting sun gently caressed her face, which shone for a moment.</t288> <t289>As I listened to her breathlessly, the sun completely set, and the lights reluctantly left her face, like children who had to end their games on the street as darkness fell.</t289>
<t290>The returning servant bent down and whispered something into Tom's ear.</t290> <t291>Tom's eyebrows furrowed.</t291> <t292>He pushed his chair back and stood up, entering inside without saying a word.</t292> <t293>After he left, Daisy became lively.</t293> <t294>With her impressive voice, she leaned in cheerfully as if singing a song:</t294>
<t295>"I really enjoy seeing you, Nick," she said, "You remind me of roses, you know?</t295> <t296>Yes, you resemble a rose.</t296> <t297>Don't you think so?" she asked Mrs. Baker, seeking confirmation, "Don't you think he resembles one?</t297><t298>"</t298>
<t299>Of course, this wasn't true.</t299> <t300>I didn't resemble roses in the slightest.</t300> <t301>He had spoken impulsively.</t301> <t302>Still, faced with this warmth overflowing from within, behind the excited words, you were swept away by the feelings that emerged as hidden emotions came to light.</t302> <t303>Suddenly, he threw his napkin on the table, stood up, apologized, and went inside.</t303>
<t304>I made eye contact with Ms. Baker.</t304> <t305>As I was preparing to speak, she straightened up and warned me with a "Shh."</t305> <t306>In the room behind us, something was being discussed in low voices.</t306> <t307>Ms. Baker leaned in without hesitation to hear better what was going on.</t307> <t308>The voices seemed to rise for a moment, then softened.</t308> <t309>A moment of shouting, then silence again.</t309>
<t310>“The Mr. Gatsby you just mentioned happens to be my neighbor...” I wanted to start the conversation.</t310>
<t311>“Be quiet for a moment!</t311> <t312>I want to hear what's going on.</t312><t313>”</t313>
<t314>“Is there a problem?” I asked innocently.</t314>
<t315>“Or don't you know?” asked Mrs. Baker, genuinely surprised. “I thought everyone knew.</t315><t316>”</t316>
<t317>“I don't know.</t317><t318>”</t318>
<t319>“Well,” he said, pausing a bit, “Tom has a mistress in New York</t319><t320>”</t320>
<t321>“His mistress?” I repeated naively.</t321>
<t322>Mr. Baker nodded.</t322> <t323>“He should be polite enough not to call during mealtime, right?</t323><t324>”</t324>
<t325>Before I had time to understand what they were saying, the rustle of fabric and the creaking of leather boots were heard, and Tom and Daisy returned to the table.</t325>
<t326>Daisy was trying to appear cheerful, but her voice was tense.</t326>
<t327>“Sorry” he said.</t327>
<t328>He sat down, looking at first Mrs. Baker and then me with questioning eyes.</t328> <t329>“I just looked outside!” he said, then, “There really is a very romantic view.</t329> <t330>There was a bird on the grass.</t330> <t331>I think it’s a nightingale that came here on one of the ships belonging to the Cunard or White Star lines.</t331> <t332>How it sings,” he continued his speech.</t332> <t333>He himself was almost warbling, “How romantic, isn’t it Tom?</t333><t334>”</t334>
<t335>"Yes, that's right," said Tom, turning to me with a weary attitude, "If it hasn't gotten dark by the time we finish eating, I'll take you to the barns."</t335>
<t336>When the phone rang once again, we all suddenly flinched.</t336> <t337>When Daisy looked at Tom and shook her head with a definite expression, all the conversation topics suddenly disappeared.</t337> <t338>From the fragments of the last five minutes at the table, what stuck in my mind was the unnecessary relighting of the candles, and although I wanted to look without hesitation, I was avoiding everyone's gaze.</t338> <t339>I couldn't know what Tom and Daisy were thinking, but despite their indifferent demeanor, it was impossible for even Mrs. Baker, who usually didn't care, to ignore the sharp ringing of the uninvited fifth person.</t339> <t340>While this situation might have aroused curiosity in people of different dispositions, I felt an immediate urge to call the police.</t340>
<t341>Needless to say, the subject of horses was never brought up again.</t341> <t342>Tom and Mrs. Baker, holding it by the head and feet as if carrying a corpse, walked slowly towards the library, leaving a couple of meters between them in the evening twilight.</t342> <t343>As for me, I tried to appear interested in the surroundings as if I hadn't heard anything, and followed Daisy onto the terrace along the chain of interconnected verandas.</t343> <t344>We sat side by side on a wicker sofa in the dim garden.</t344>
<t345>Daisy, as if feeling her beautiful features, took her face in her hands and turned her gaze to the velvet-colored twilight.</t345> <t346>I could see that storms were raging inside her.</t346> <t347>To calm her down, I started asking questions about her little girl.</t347>
<t348>“Are you aware, Nick, we don't know each other very well,” she suddenly said, “you didn't even come to my wedding.</t348><t349>”</t349>
<t350>“I hadn't returned from the pole.</t350><t351>”</t351>
<t352>“Right,” he paused, “I went through very bad days, Nick.</t352> <t353>I started to look at everything with suspicion.</t353><t354>”</t354>
<t355>He was right to look.</t355> <t356>I waited, but he didn't say anything else.</t356> <t357>In a rather feeble voice, I started talking about his daughter again.</t357> <t358>“She must be talking by now, eating her meals, doing everything.</t358><t359>”</t359>
<t360>“Yes, indeed!” he looked at my face absentmindedly, “Listen Nick, do you want to know what I said when you were born?</t360><t361>”</t361>
<t362>“A lot, indeed.</t362><t363>”</t363>
<t364>“Maybe this way you will understand how I view things.</t364> <t365>It hadn't even been an hour since I gave birth.</t365> <t366>God knows where Tom was.</t366> <t367>When I came out of anesthesia, a deep sense of abandonment filled me, and I asked the nurse whether it was a girl or a boy.</t367> <t368>When I learned it was a girl, I turned my back and cried, 'Alright,' I said to myself, 'I'm glad it's a girl.'</t368> <t369>I hope she will be a fool.</t369> <t370>Because in this world, the best thing for a girl is to be a fool and beautiful.</t370><t371>”</t371>
<t372>“You must have realized that I always see the bad side of everything,” he continued in a determined voice, “everyone thinks that way.</t372> <t373>Even the most educated ones.</t373> <t374>And I am sure of it.</t374> <t375>I have been everywhere, seen everything, done whatever I wanted.”</t375> <t376>His eyes challenged the world, looking just like Tom.</t376> <t377>He let out a laugh full of contempt, “I am a sophisticated person.</t377> <t378>God, how sophisticated I am.”</t378>
<t379>The moment the voice that had drawn my interest and belief fell silent, I realized how insincere its words actually were.</t379> <t380>This had disturbed me quite a bit.</t380> <t381>Everything that happened in the evening seemed to me like schemes designed to evoke sympathetic feelings towards him.</t381> <t382>I waited silently.</t382> <t383>A few minutes later, a mocking smile appeared on his charming face.</t383> <t384>He looked at me as if he and Tom were members of a very important secret organization that no one knew about.</t384>
<t385>Inside, the red room was filled with light.</t385> <t386>Tom and Mrs. Baker were sitting at the two ends of the long couch, the young woman was reading the Saturday Evening Post magazine aloud.</t386> <t387>Tom was listening to the words that joined together and turned into a soothing murmur.</t387> <t388>The lights on the ceiling were shining on his boots, dimming in the girl's autumn-leaf-colored hair, and moving over the pages she turned with her arm muscles.</t388>
<t389>When we entered, he looked at our faces without speaking, his hand suspended in the air for a while.</t389>
<t390>"To be continued," he said as he tossed the magazine onto the table.</t390> <t391>Then, hurriedly lowering his leg from over the other, he jumped to his feet.</t391>
<t392>“It is ten o'clock,” she said, as if looking at a clock on the ceiling, “It's time for good girls to go to bed.</t392><t393>”</t393>
<t394>“Jordan will participate in the tournament in Westchester tomorrow,” said Daisy.</t394>
<t395>“So you are Jordan Baker.”</t395><t396>”</t396>
<t397>Now I understood why his face looked familiar.</t397> <t398>I had often come across this beautiful face, which looked a bit arrogant, while reading sports news from places like Ashville, Hot Springs, and Palm Beach.</t398> <t399>Long ago, I had also heard a rather unpleasant story about him, but I didn't quite remember it at that moment.</t399>
<t400>“Good night,” he said in a low voice, “will you wake me up at eight o'clock?”</t400><t401>”</t401>
<t402>“If you are going to wake up, why not.</t402><t403>”</t403>
<t404>“I will wake up.</t404> <t405>Good night Mr. Carraway, see you soon.</t405><t406>”</t406>
<t407>“Of course you will meet,” said Daisy.</t407> <t408>“Maybe I'll get you two married.</t408> <t409>Visit us often, Nick.</t409> <t410>In the meantime, I’ll –you know– bring you two together.</t410> <t411>Maybe I'll lock you in the laundry closet or put you on a boat and set sail for distant seas.</t411> <t412>I'll do something.</t412><t413>”</t413>
<t414>“Good night,” said Mrs. Baker as she walked up the stairs, “I will pretend I didn't hear this.</t414><t415>”</t415>
<t416>“Sweet girl,” said Tom after she left, “it would be better if they didn't let her wander around like that.</t416><t417>”</t417>
<t418>“Who?” Daisy asked in a cold voice.</t418>
<t419>“His family.</t419><t420>”</t420>
<t421>“The family you mentioned is his hundred-year-old aunt.</t421> <t422>Besides, Nick will take care of her now, right Nick? Jordan will be here many weekends this summer.</t422> <t423>The atmosphere of this home will do her a lot of good.</t423><t424>”</t424>
<t425>They both fell silent and looked at each other.</t425>
<t426>"Are you from New York?" I asked.</t426>
<t427>"From Louisville."</t427> <t428>"We spent the innocent years of our youth there."</t428> <t429>"That innocence..."</t429><t430>"</t430>
<t431>“Did you complain to Nick while sitting on the terrace?” Tom suddenly asked.</t431>
<t432>"Did I do that?" he looked at my face.</t432>
<t433>“Although I don't quite remember, I think we talked about the Normans.</t433> <t434>Yes, I'm sure it was like that.</t434> <t435>It suddenly came to our minds, and then we looked and saw that...</t435><t436>”</t436>
<t437>"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick," Tom advised.</t437>
<t438>I said quietly that I didn't hear anything.</t438> <t439>A few minutes later, I got up to leave.</t439> <t440>They stood side by side in the light that rained down on them as they came to the door to see me off.</t440> <t441>When I got into my car and started the engine, a commanding "Wait!" came from Daisy.</t441>
<t442>“I was going to ask you something important, but I forgot.</t442> <t443>We heard that you got engaged to a girl from the West.</t443>
<t444>“Right,” said Tom in agreement, “we heard you got engaged.”</t444><t445>”</t445>
<t446>“They have slandered me.</t446> <t447>I don't have enough money to get married.</t447><t448>”</t448>
<t449>“But that's what we heard,” insisted Daisy.</t449> <t450>I was surprised by her sudden blossoming from her previously calm state.</t450> <t451>“We heard it from three different people, it must be true.</t451><t452>”</t452>
<t453>Of course, I understood what they were talking about, but I hadn't even come close to getting engaged.</t453> <t454>The rumors circulating about me starting the marriage procedures were one of the reasons I came to the East anyway.</t454> <t455>You can't stop seeing an old friend because of rumors, but I wasn't going to get married just because there were rumors.</t455>
<t456>Tom and Daisy's interest in me had greatly affected me and had somewhat reduced the distance between us, born of their wealth.</t456> <t457>On the way back home, my mind was a bit confused and I was angry.</t457> <t458>All Daisy had to do was leave the house as she embraced her daughter.</t458> <t459>But it was clear that she had no such intention.</t459> <t460>For Tom, having a mistress in New York was less surprising than getting depressed over a book he read.</t460> <t461>His ostentatious physical strength was no longer sufficient to nourish that domineering spirit of his, so he was busy gnawing at some stale ideas.</t461>
<t462>The summer atmosphere was strongly felt in the roadside restaurants and repair shops with brightly lit red gasoline pumps in front of them.</t462> <t463>When I reached my mansion in West Egg, I parked the car in the garage and sat down by the abandoned lawn mower in the garden.</t463> <t464>A noisy, bright night remained, filled with the sound of wings flapping in the trees, the relentless organ sounds produced by tireless frogs, and the bellows blowing with all their might from the ground.</t464> <t465>A cat suddenly stumbled under the moonlight.</t465> <t466>When I turned my head to look at it, I realized I was not alone.</t466> <t467>Fifteen meters ahead, a figure distinguished from the shadow of the neighboring mansion, with hands in pockets, was watching the silver sprinkling of stars.</t467> <t468>His relaxed demeanor and confident strides on the grass made me think it was Mr. Gatsby, out for a walk to calculate how much of the paradise around us he owned.</t468>
<t469>I decided to call out.</t469> <t470>Ms. Baker mentioning him at dinner would also be an excuse for us to meet.</t470> <t471>But I changed my mind.</t471> <t472>Because he made a sudden gesture implying he was happy in his solitude.</t472> <t473>He stretched his arms towards the dark waters, and even though I was quite far, I could have sworn he was trembling.</t473> <t474>Involuntarily, I turned my gaze towards the sea.</t474> <t475>All I could see was a small, green light shining alone in the distance.</t475> <t476>It must have been the far end of a dock or something.</t476> <t477>I turned back towards where Gatsby had been.</t477> <t478>He was gone.</t478> <t479>And I was once again alone in that noisy darkness.</t479>
<t480>CHAPTER 2</t480>
<t481>Almost halfway between West Egg and New York, the highway meets the railroad to avoid passing through that desolate area, and for about four hundred meters, the two run side by side.</t481> <t482>This is the valley of ashes.</t482> <t483>It is almost like a strange farm where ashes grow like wheat on mountain ridges, hills, and peculiar gardens.</t483> <t484>So much so that these ashes take the form of houses, chimneys, and the smoke rising from the chimneys; and ultimately, with an incredible effort, they take the shape of people who are already crumbling and disintegrating in the dusty air, wandering vaguely.</t484> <t485>From time to time, a series of gray trucks slowly move along an invisible road and stop with a terrible screech of brakes, then ash-colored people with leaden shovels in their hands suddenly appear and raise a dense cloud of dust that obscures what they are doing there.</t485>
<t486>Nevertheless, before long, you notice the eyes of Doctor T.</t486> <t487>J.</t487> <t488>Eckleburg above the gray land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it.</t488> <t489>These blue eyes are enormous, their irises are over a yard high. They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.</t489> <t490>Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness, or forgot them and moved away.</t490> <t491>After a long time under the sun and rain, they had become dimmed and now stared down at the gloomy landscape with a sort of persistent stare.</t491>
<t492>On one side of the Valley of Ashes, a small and dirty river stretches out. When the drawbridge over it is raised to allow barges to pass, the passengers inside the waiting train are sometimes forced to look at this depressing view for half an hour.</t492> <t493>Every train inevitably stops here for at least a minute; it was during such a moment that I had the chance to meet Tom Buchanan's mistress.</t493>
<t494>The news that he had a mistress was already on everyone's lips.</t494> <t495>Tom's friends were secretly annoyed by him showing up at trendy restaurants with the woman, and even leaving her at the table to wander around chatting here and there.</t495> <t496>Even though I was curious about this woman, I had no desire to meet her; yet it happened anyway.</t496> <t497>One afternoon, while I was heading to New York with Tom, we stopped near the ash heaps, and suddenly he jumped up, grabbed my arm, and practically forced me off the train.</t497>
<t498>“Let's get off,” he insisted, “I will introduce you to my daughter.”</t498> <t499>Probably because he had too much to drink at dinner, his insistence on me accompanying him had almost turned into bullying.</t499> <t500>He also had a rather arrogant reason for this; could I have anything better to do on a Sunday afternoon?</t500>
<t501>I climbed over the low whitewashed fence of the railway, and under Doctor Eckleburg's fixed gaze, we walked back about a hundred meters along the road.</t501> <t502>The only visible structure was a yellow brick block, which, though it consisted of several adjoining buildings as if on a main street, had nothing beyond it.</t502> <t503>Of the three shops in this building, the first was for rent, the second was a morning diner accessible only by an ashy road, and the last was an automobile garage: Repairs, GEORGE B. WILSON, Cars bought and sold.</t503>
<t504>I followed Tom inside.</t504> <t505>The interior was unpretentious, almost bare.</t505> <t506>The only visible car was a wrecked, dust-covered Ford, hidden away in a dark corner.</t506> <t507>Just as I started to think that this dingy garage might be hiding a well-furnished, romantic love nest somewhere in the back, the garage owner appeared at the office door, cleaning his hands with a rag.</t507> <t508>The blond man was pale but could be considered handsome.</t508> <t509>When he saw us, his light blue eyes lit up with hope.</t509>
<t510>“Hello Wilson, you old man,” said Tom, cheerfully patting the man on the shoulder, “How are things going?</t510><t511>”</t511>
<t512>"There's nothing wrong," said Wilson in a not very convincing manner.</t512> <t513>"When are you going to sell me that car?</t513><t514>"</t514>
<t515>“Next week.</t515> <t516>My man is dealing with that stuff these days.</t516><t517>”</t517>
<t518>“Is he perhaps taking it a bit slow?</t518><t519>”</t519>
<t520>“Absolutely not!” said Tom coldly, “if that's what you think, maybe I should sell the car to someone else.</t520><t521>”</t521>
<t522>“No, what I meant,” said Wilson hastily, “is just - ”</t522>
<t523>He couldn't continue, looked around impatiently.</t523> <t524>At that moment, I heard footsteps coming from the stairs, then I noticed that a woman standing at the office door, with her somewhat large body, was blocking the light.</t524> <t525>She was in her mid-thirties, although quite full-figured, she carried her extra weight in an extraordinarily beautiful way that very few women could manage.</t525> <t526>There was no unusual beauty in her face above her navy blue polka-dotted crepe de chine dress, yet from her body emanated a tremendous vitality that was noticeable at first glance, as if every nerve in her body was burning inside.</t526> <t527>She smiled, walked past the man as if her husband was invisible, and approached, looking into Tom's eyes for a long time while shaking his hand.</t527> <t528>She licked her lips and, without turning around, called out to her husband in a low but coarse voice: "Why don't you bring a few chairs?</t528> <t529>Look, people are standing!</t529><t530>"</t530>
<t531>“Oh sure, right away,” said Wilson, who hurriedly entered the small office and then disappeared into the concrete-colored walls.</t531> <t532>Apart from the woman approaching Tom, the cloud of ash and dust that covered everything in the surroundings also obscured the man's dark suit and pale hair from view.</t532>
<t533>“I must see you!” said Tom insistently.</t533> <t534>“Catch the next train.</t534><t535>”</t535>
<t536>“Okay.</t536><t537>”</t537>
<t538>“Let's meet in front of the newspaper kiosk below.</t538><t539>”</t539>
<t540>The woman nodded her head and moved away from Tom as George Wilson appeared at the office door with two chairs.</t540>
<t541>We waited down the road, in a secluded corner out of sight.</t541> <t542>It was a few days before the 4th of July; a scrawny, skinny Italian boy was lining up firecrackers on the tracks at that moment.</t542>
<t543>“What a terrible place, isn't it?” said Tom, as he exchanged glances with Doctor Eckleburg.</t543>
<t544>"Terrible!"</t544>
<t545>“Getting out will do him good too.</t545><t546>”</t546>
<t547>“Wouldn't her husband object?</t547><t548>”</t548>
<t549>“Wilson, huh?</t549> <t550>He thinks she went to see her sister in New York.</t550> <t551>That fool has no clue about the world!</t551><t552>”</t552>
<t553>Thus, we set off towards New York with Tom and his mistress; although it couldn't really be said that we were together, because Mrs. Wilson traveled in another compartment; at least Tom had taken into account the possibility of encountering East Eggers on the train.</t553> <t554>During this time, the woman had also changed her clothes; with Tom's help, she got off the train wearing a tight, brown-patterned muslin dress that revealed her broad hips as she stretched.</t554> <t555>She bought a magazine called Kent Gossip and a cinema magazine from the newsstand at the station; from the pharmacy, she got a cream and a small bottle of perfume.</t555> <t556>Amid the noise and darkness upstairs, after turning down four taxis, she finally liked a gray-upholstered, purple-colored taxi.</t556> <t557>We were finally escaping the crowd of the station and stepping into the daylight when she suddenly turned her face from the window she was watching outside, leaned forward, and tapped on the glass.</t557> <t558>"I want one of those dogs over there," she said in a determined voice, "it will stay in the apartment; we need to get such a dog for there.</t558><t559>"</t559>
<t560>The taxi reversed until it stopped next to an old man with white hair who strangely resembled John D. Rockefeller.</t560> <t561>In the basket hanging around the man's neck, a dozen newborn puppies of indeterminate breed were huddled together.</t561> <t562>Mrs. Wilson asked the old man who approached the car window, "What breed are they?"</t562>
<t563>“There is every kind.</t563> <t564>What are you looking for?</t564><t565>”</t565>
<t566>"Actually, I want one of those police dogs.</t566> <t567>But you don't have that breed, do you?</t567><t568>"</t568>
<t569>The old man's eyes wandered over the basket with suspicion, and soon he plunged his hand in and grabbed one by the nape, pulling out the wriggling puppy.</t569>
<t570>“This is not a police dog,” said Tom.</t570>
<t571>“Well, not exactly,” said the man, his disappointment reflected in his voice, “Actually, this is an Airedale terrier,” he continued speaking while stroking the animal's brown tufted back, “Look at that fur.</t571> <t572>This dog will never get sick and make you sad.</t572><t573>”</t573>
<t574>“What a lovely thing!” said Mrs. Wilson excitedly.</t574> <t575>“How much?</t575><t576>”</t576>
<t577>“This one?” After looking at the dog with admiration, the man said, “I’ll give it to you for ten dollars.”</t577> <t578>Although it had some Airedale Terrier in its lineage, the tiny Airedale with overly white feet eventually changed hands and settled into the lap of Mrs. Wilson, who began to caress its airtight fur ecstatically.</t578>
<t579>“Is it female or male?” the woman asked gently.</t579>
<t580>“This one? Male.</t580><t581>”</t581>
<t582>“Oh, it's a female!” Tom said dismissively.</t582> <t583>“Take your money and go!</t583> <t584>With this money, you can buy ten more of these!</t584><t585>”</t585>
<t586>We headed towards Fifth Avenue, on that warm and sweet, even almost rural summer day, I would hardly have been surprised if a flock of white sheep had suddenly appeared from around the corner.</t586>
<t587>“Let's stop,” I said, “I need to get off here.</t587><t588>”</t588>
<t589>"No way!" Tom objected.</t589> <t590>"If you don't join us, Myrtle will be very upset, won't you Myrtle?</t590><t591>"</t591>
<t592>“Come on,” insisted the woman.</t592> <t593>“I will call my sister Catherine and invite her too.</t593> <t594>Those who know her say she is very beautiful.</t594><t595>”</t595>
<t596>“I would love to, but -”</t596>
<t597>We continued to progress, turning from Central Park and heading towards the West Hundreds.</t597> <t598>The taxi stopped in front of one of the buildings on 158th Street, which resembled a long, white cake.</t598> <t599>After glancing around in honor of her return home, Mrs. Wilson proudly entered, gathering her dog and packages.</t599>
<t600>"I will also invite the McKees," he announced while taking the elevator, "Of course, I also need to call my brother.</t600><t601>"</t601>
<t602>A small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom, and a small bathroom made up the apartment, which was on the top floor.</t602> <t603>The living room was so filled with furniture that was too large for the room and covered with tapestries that it was impossible to move without stumbling over a few cheerful ladies depicted in the gardens of the Palace of Versailles.</t603> <t604>The only picture hanging on the wall was an overly enlarged photograph.</t604> <t605>At first glance, it vaguely resembled a chicken perched on a rock, but upon looking again from a distance, the chicken turned into a bonnet, and the chubby face of a smiling old lady filled the entire room.</t605> <t606>On the table were a few old issues of “Town Tattler,” Robert Keable's popular novel Simon Called Peter, and some of Broadway's gossip magazines.</t606> <t607>Mrs. Wilson first attended to the dog.</t607> <t608>Although it was clear from his demeanor that he was reluctant, the elevator boy was sent to fetch a box filled with straw and some milk.</t608> <t609>When the boy returned, he had not hesitated to add a large box of dog biscuits, which he had thought of himself, even though these biscuits would just dissolve in a bowl of milk all afternoon.</t609> <t610>Meanwhile, Tom had taken a bottle of whiskey out of a locked cabinet.</t610>
<t611>I have only been drunk twice in my life, and the second time happened to me that day.</t611> <t612>Therefore, even though the apartment was filled with bright sunlight until eight o'clock, everything seemed to be covered in a dim and misty haze.</t612> <t613>Mrs. Wilson sat on Tom's lap and made phone calls here and there.</t613> <t614>Then we realized we were out of cigarettes; I left the house to go to the tobacconist at the corner.</t614> <t615>When I returned, there was no one around.</t615> <t616>So I sat quietly in the living room and read a section from Simon Called Peter; I don't know if the book was terrible or if the whiskey I drank had muddled my mind, but I couldn't make much sense of what I read.</t616>
<t617>Just after Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink, I had become quite familiar with Mrs. Wilson) appeared, guests started trickling in one by one.</t617> <t618>Catherine, the sister, had oily, thick, and short red hair; her face was milk white due to excessive powder, she was slender, overly fond of worldly pleasures, and a woman in her thirties.</t618> <t619>All her eyebrows were plucked, and a new pair of more arched eyebrows were drawn with a pencil, but nature's effort to revive the old line had dulled the expression on her face.</t619> <t620>The bracelets she wore clinked together with every movement, creating a constant jingling sound.</t620> <t621>She had entered with the airs of a hostess, eyeing the belongings so possessively that I thought she lived there.</t621> <t622>When I asked her about it, she burst into laughter, first repeating my question out loud, and then said she was staying at a hotel with a girlfriend.</t622>
<t623>Mr. McKee, who was sitting downstairs, was a pale and somewhat effeminate man.</t623> <t624>From the white foam mark left on his cheekbone, it was clear that he had just shaved.</t624> <t625>He greeted those in the room with great respect.</t625> <t626>He had told me that he was “from the art world”; later, I learned that he was a photographer and that he was the one who enlarged the photo of Mrs. Wilson's mother, which stood on the wall like an ectoplasmic manifestation.</t626> <t627>His wife was a shrill-voiced, sluggish, pleasant, and terrifying woman.</t627> <t628>She had proudly recounted that since they got married, her husband had taken her photograph one hundred and twenty-seven times.</t628>
<t629>Mrs. Wilson had changed her outfit a while ago; she was now wearing a flamboyant, cream-colored chiffon cocktail dress that filled the room with a rustling sound as she walked; it was as if her personality had changed with the dress.</t629> <t630>The intense life energy she exuded in the workshop had given way to an immense arrogance.</t630> <t631>With each passing moment, her laughter, gestures, and speech became more and more artificial; as she puffed up, the space in the room seemed to shrink.</t631> <t632>Finally, the woman appeared to be revolving on an axis in the smoke-filled room, creaking as she turned.</t632>
<t633>“My dear,” she called out to her sister in a loud yet coquettish voice, “People are practically swindlers; all they care about is money.</t633> <t634>Last week, I called a woman here for a pedicure; if you heard the bill she gave me, you'd think she performed an appendectomy instead of a pedicure.</t634><t635>”</t635>
<t636>“What was this woman's name?” asked Mrs. McKee.</t636>
<t637>“Mr. Ebenhardt.</t637> <t638>He goes to houses for pedicures.</t638><t639>”</t639>
<t640>“I absolutely love your dress,” said Mrs. McKee, “It's wonderful!</t640><t641>”</t641>
<t642>Mr. Wilson raised his eyebrows and dismissively rejected the compliment, "Oh, this old rag?</t642> <t643>I just throw it on when I don't care about my appearance.</t643><t644>"</t644>
<t645>“But it really looks wonderful on you,” insisted Mrs. McKee.</t645> <t646>“If Chester could capture this pose of yours, it would make a splendid photograph.</t646><t647>”</t647>
<t648>We looked at Mrs. Wilson in silence; she sweetly smiled, tossing back a lock of hair that had fallen on her face.</t648> <t649>Mr. McKee tilted his head to the side and carefully examined the woman, then began to move his hand back and forth at eye level.</t649>
<t650>“The light needs to change,” he said after a moment, “I want to bring out the facial features, and the hair in the background needs to be in the frame as well.</t650><t651>”</t651>
<t652>“If you ask me, there's no need to change the light at all,” cried Mrs. McKee, “besides-”</t652>
<t653>Adam silenced the woman by saying "Shhh!", and we turned back to look at the model again.</t653> <t654>At that moment, Tom Buchanan stood up, yawning loudly.</t654>
<t655>“Come on, McKees, let's have a drink.</t655> <t656>Myrtle, could you bring some more ice and soda before our guests fall asleep?</t656><t657>”</t657>
<t658>“I had already told the child to bring ice,” said Myrtle, raising her eyebrows in frustration at the incompetence of the lower class, “Ah, these people!</t658> <t659>You can't take your eyes off them for a moment!</t659><t660>”</t660>
<t661>He looked at me and burst into laughter out of nowhere.</t661> <t662>Then, he lunged towards the dog, wrapping it up in his arms, smothering it with kisses; immediately after, as if a dozen chefs were waiting for his orders, he stormed into the kitchen.</t662>
<t663>"I had some very nice work on Long Island," said Mr. McKee, defensively.</t663>
<t664>Tom stared blankly at the man's face.</t664>
<t665>“We had two of them framed, they are downstairs.</t665>
<t666>“What do you mean by two?” asked Tom.</t666>
<t667>“Of course, I have two works: I named one Montauk Point - Seagulls, and the other Montauk Point - Sea.</t667><t668>”</t668>
<t669>My sister Catherine sat on the couch next to me.</t669>
<t670>“Do you also live in Long Island?” he asked.</t670>
<t671>“No, I am in West Egg.</t671><t672>”</t672>
<t673>“Really?</t673> <t674>About a month ago, I went there for a party at a man named Gatsby's house.</t674> <t675>Do you know him?</t675><t676>”</t676>
<t677>“He is my next-door neighbor.</t677><t678>”</t678>
<t679>“It is said that the man is the nephew or cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm.</t679> <t680>The source of his wealth is also him.</t680><t681>”</t681>
<t682>“Is that so?</t682><t683>”</t683>
<t684>The girl nodded her head and continued.</t684>
<t685>“I was really scared.</t685> <t686>I don't want him to know anything about me.</t686><t687>”</t687>
<t688>The interesting information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee's intervention, pointing at Catherine with her hand and shouting: "Look Chester, you could do a good job with this girl."</t688> <t689>However, Mr. McKee dismissed her with a weary nod and turned back to Tom:</t689>
<t690>“If I had the opportunity to enter, I would like to do other studies in Long Island.</t690> <t691>All I want is to be given a chance.</t691><t692>”</t692>
<t693>“Tell this to Myrtle,” said Tom, then burst into laughter, just as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray in her hand, “tell her to write a letter of recommendation for you, won't you write it, Myrtle?</t693><t694>”</t694>
<t695>“What am I supposed to write?” the woman asked, startled.</t695>
<t696>"Honey, I’m saying, if you could write a letter of introduction for McKee, so he can work with him."</t696> <t697>Then he quietly muttered a title, "George B. at the Gas Pump</t697> <t698>Wilson, or something like that.</t698><t699>"</t699>
<t700>Catherine leaned in and whispered in my ear, "Neither of them can stand their spouses."</t700>
<t701>"No way!</t701><t702>"</t702>
<t703>“Really!” He looked first at Myrtle and then at Tom, “If you can't stand it, why do you keep it up, right?</t703> <t704>If I were in their place, I wouldn't wait at all, I would get divorced and then marry the person I love.</t704><t705>”</t705>
<t706>“Doesn't Myrtle love Wilson at all?</t706><t707>”</t707>
<t708>The answer to my question came in a way I never expected.</t708> <t709>Myrtle, who had been eavesdropping, responded to my question with a mouthful of curses.</t709>
<t710>“You see!” cried Catherine triumphantly.</t710> <t711>Then she lowered her voice again.</t711> <t712>“Actually, the reason they can't be together is Tom's wife.</t712> <t713>She's Catholic, you know their divorces are forbidden.</t713><t714>”</t714>
<t715>Since I knew Daisy wasn't Catholic, I was a bit shaken by this big lie.</t715>
<t716>“As soon as they get married,” he continued, “they will go to the West and live there until things settle down.</t716><t717>”</t717>
<t718>“Why don't they go to Europe!”</t718>
<t719>“So, you like Europe too?” he exclaimed excitedly, “I just returned from Monte Carlo.</t719><t720>”</t720>
<t721>“Oh, really?</t721><t722>”</t722>
<t723>“More precisely, I was there last year.</t723> <t724>I had gone with a female friend.</t724><t725>”</t725>
<t726>"Did you stay long?"</t726><t727>"</t727>
<t728>“No, I can say that our trip to Monte Carlo was as good as our return.</t728> <t729>We had gone via Marseille.</t729> <t730>When we set out, we had twelve hundred dollars with us; but we fell for those special rooms and within two days we were penniless.</t730> <t731>I can't describe what we went through until we returned.</t731> <t732>My God, I hate that place!</t732><t733>”</t733>
<t734>For a moment, I was lost in the sky outside the window, which was tinged with the beloved Mediterranean blue, when Mrs. McKee's shrill voice brought me back to reality:</t734>
<t735>“I almost got myself into trouble,” she said excitedly, “I was this close to marrying a man who had been chasing after me for years, even though he was not my equal at all.</t735> <t736>Everyone around me was warning, ‘Lucille, this man is not worthy of you.’</t736> <t737>If I hadn't met Chester, he would have definitely convinced me.</t737><t738>”</t738>
<t739>“But look,” said Myrtle Wilson, shaking her head, “at least you didn't marry him.</t739><t740>”</t740>
<t741>“Yes, fortunately.”</t741><t742>”</t742>
<t743>“Well, I got married!” he then said suggestively, “and that's the difference between us.”</t743>
<t744>“But why, Myrtle?” asked Catherine, “No one had forced you!</t744><t745>”</t745>
<t746>Myrtle thought for a moment, "Actually, I married him because I thought he was a gentleman.</t746> <t747>I believed he was well-mannered, but he wasn't even worthy of licking my shoes.</t747>
<t748>“You used to be madly in love with her,” said Catherine.</t748>
<t749>“Was I in love?” Myrtle cried.</t749> <t750>She seemed unable to believe what she was hearing, “Where did you get that from?</t750> <t751>I loved him only as much as I love the man sitting over there.</t751><t752>”</t752>
<t753>The fact that he was pointing at me had caused everyone to look at me as if I were a criminal, while I tried to show with my facial expression that I definitely had no place in his past.</t753>
<t754>“The only time I acted insanely was the moment I married him.</t754> <t755>As soon as we got married, I realized it was a huge mistake.</t755> <t756>It turned out he had borrowed a friend's suit for his own wedding ceremony and hadn't told me a single thing about it.</t756> <t757>Then one day, while he was not at home, this man showed up, ‘Oh!</t757> <t758>So the suit is yours?” I said, “This is the first time I'm hearing this from you!</t758><t759>’ Still, I gave the suit to the man, then shut myself in the bedroom and cried my heart out until evening.</t759><t760>”</t760>
<t761>"She really needs to leave that man," Catherine continued the story from where she left off, "They have been living in that apartment above the repair shop for exactly eleven years, and Tom is her first lover anyway.</t761><t762>"</t762>
<t763>The second bottle of whiskey was now being passed around, and everyone except Catherine, who said she felt good without drinking, was filling their glasses.</t763><t764>Tom called the doorman and asked him to bring some sandwiches from the nearby deli, which were famous for being filling enough to be a meal on their own.</t764><t765>As evening fell, I wanted to go outside and take a walk eastward, towards the park, in that sweet coolness.</t765><t766>But whenever I intended to get up, I would get caught in a fierce and noisy argument that tied me to my seat like a rope, and in the end, I would remain stuck in my chair.</t766><t767>In sharing the privacy of a person who happened to be passing through the darkening streets, the series of yellow windows of this apartment over the city certainly had a part.</t767><t768>At that moment, I was also someone randomly passing by, almost looking up and wondering what was happening there.</t768><t769>With the idea that I was both inside and outside, the inexhaustible variety of life both fascinated and disgusted me.</t769>
<t770>Myrtle brought her chair closer to me, and as she began to recount her first meeting with Tom, I could feel her warm breath on my face.</t770>
<t771>“In the compartments, we always sat opposite each other in the least preferred single seats.</t771> <t772>I was coming to New York to spend the night with my sister.</t772> <t773>Tom was wearing a suit and patent leather shoes; I couldn't take my eyes off him, but when he looked at me, I pretended to be fixated on the billboard above him.</t773> <t774>When the train arrived at the station, he was right next to me, resting his starched shirt front on my arm.</t774> <t775>Even though I said I would call the police, he realized I wasn't serious.</t775> <t776>When we got into the taxi together, I was so excited that I didn't even notice we had taken a taxi instead of the subway.</t776> <t777>The same words kept running through my mind, ‘You only live once…</t777> <t778>You only live once...</t778><t779>’</t779><t780>”</t780>
<t781>Then she turned to Mrs. McKee and let out a fake laugh.</t781> <t782>“My dear,” she called out, “As soon as I'm done with this dress, I'll give it to you, since I'll be getting a new one tomorrow anyway.</t782> <t783>In the meantime, it would be good to make a list of my tasks for tomorrow; first a massage, then my hair appointment, I need to get a leash for the dog, then I want to buy some of those cute ashtrays, you know, the spring-loaded ones; and I need to get a wreath with a black silk bow that will last all summer for my mother's grave.</t783> <t784>To make sure I don't forget, I’d better go and prepare a list.</t784><t785>”</t785>
<t786>It was nine o'clock, and shortly after, when I looked at my watch again, I saw that it was ten.</t786> <t787>Mr. McKee had fallen asleep with his hands in his lap, fists clenched; in this state, he looked like a photo of a vigorous man.</t787> <t788>I took out my handkerchief and wiped off the dried shaving foam on his cheekbone that had been bothering me all day.</t788>
<t789>The tiny dog that had settled on the table was looking through the cigarette smoke with blind eyes, occasionally letting out soft whimpers.</t789> <t790>People were appearing and disappearing, planning to go somewhere, then losing each other, only to meet again a few steps away.</t790> <t791>Towards midnight, Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson had engaged in a heated argument about whether Myrtle had the right to mention Daisy's name.</t791>
<t792>“Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!” shouted Mrs. Wilson, “I’ll say it whenever I want!</t792> <t793>Daisy! Dai-” Tom Buchanan had suddenly slapped her, breaking her nose!</t793>
<t794>Afterwards, it was complete chaos; bloodied towels scattered here and there in the bathroom, women's voices scolding Tom, and cries of pain rising incessantly, drowning out everything else.</t794> <t795>Mr. McKee, awakened by the noise, jumped up groggily and headed for the door.</t795> <t796>He stopped halfway, staring at the scene in bewilderment.</t796> <t797>While his wife and Catherine were running around, bumping into the crowded furniture with bandages in their hands, they were both scolding Tom and trying to console the poor Myrtle, who was struggling to cover their Versailles-view chairs with Kent Gossip magazines to protect them from the blood streaming from her nose.</t797> <t798>Then Mr. McKee turned his back on this scene and walked out the door, and I immediately grabbed my hat hanging nearby and followed him out.</t798>
<t799>“Come over for dinner one day,” he said, as they descended in the creaky elevator together.</t799>
<t800>"Where to?" I asked.</t800>
<t801>“Anywhere will do.</t801><t802>”</t802>
<t803>"Take your hand off the lever," the elevator boy scolded.</t803>
<t804>“I'm sorry,” said Mr. McKee seriously, “I didn't realize I had touched it.</t804><t805>”</t805>
<t806>“Alright,” I said, accepting the suggestion, “I would be pleased.</t806><t807>”</t807>
<t808>...</t808> <t809>I was standing next to the bed, while she was sitting under the sheets in her underwear with a huge album in her hands.</t809>
<t810>“Beauty and the Beast, Loneliness, The Old Milkman's Horse, Brooklyn Bridge…”</t810><t811>”</t811>
<t812>…</t812> <t813>Soon after, lying in the cold lower level of Pennsylvania Station, between sleep and wakefulness, I was staring at the Tribune morning newspaper, waiting for the four o'clock train.</t813>
<t814>CHAPTER 3</t814>
<t815>On summer nights, the sounds of music would rise from my neighbor's house.</t815> <t816>In their blue gardens, men and women would flit about like moths among whispers, champagne, and stars.</t816> <t817>In the afternoons, as the tide rose, I would watch guests diving from the diving platform on the raft waiting offshore or people sunbathing on the hot sands in front of the mansion, while two motorboats sped through the Bosphorus, leaving foamy trails for water skiers.</t817> <t818>On weekends, my neighbor's Rolls Royce would be used like a bus from nine in the morning until late at night, constantly ferrying people from the city to the mansion or from the mansion to the city.</t818> <t819>Meanwhile, their station wagon would meet all incoming trains, shuttling back and forth between the station and the house like a giant yellow bug.</t819> <t820>By Monday morning, eight servants, including an extra gardener, would work all day with brooms, cloths, brushes, hammers, and garden shears to repair the damage from the previous night and clean up the place.</t820>
<t821>Every Friday, five crates of oranges and lemons from a greengrocer in New York would arrive, and every Monday, they would leave the house through the back door as a pyramid of squeezed half-shells.</t821> <t822>In the kitchen, there was a machine that, with the butler pressing his thumb two hundred times, could squeeze the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour.</t822>
<t823>Every fifteen days at least, a group of people working in the catering service would come with meters of tarpaulin and enough bulbs to turn Gatsby's enormous garden into a Christmas tree, and they would work.</t823> <t824>The prepared tables would be adorned with various hors d'oeuvres, colorful salads accompanying a crowd of spicy cold meats, animal-shaped pastries, and roasted bacon and turkeys.</t824> <t825>The bar set up in the main hall with brass railings would have such drinks that had not been produced for a long time that most of the female guests were not old enough to know these liqueurs and gins.</t825>
<t826>When it was seven in the evening, the musicians would take their places.</t826> <t827>It was not a thin band of three to five people, but a magnificent orchestra consisting of oboe, trombone, saxophone, violin, cornet, flute, and numerous drums of various sizes.</t827> <t828>The last remaining swimmers would also be returning from the beach and getting dressed upstairs.</t828> <t829>Those coming from New York by car would fill the first five rows in the parking lot.</t829> <t830>The rooms, lounges, and verandas would be filled with colorful clothes, strange hairstyles, and shawls more varied than those in Castile would wander around.</t830> <t831>The bar would start operating at full capacity, and cocktail glasses floating in the air would blend into the night in the garden outside.</t831> <t832>Conversations and laughter would enliven the atmosphere, casual hints and introductions would be instantly forgotten, and heated conversations would begin among women who didn't even learn each other's names.</t832>
<t833>As the Earth moved away from the sun, the lights would shine brighter; when the orchestra started playing a blonde cocktail music, the opera of conversations would rise a few tones.</t833> <t834>With each passing minute, laughter would be spent more generously, and even a small word would be enough to cheer people up.</t834> <t835>Groups would change more quickly, swell up with newcomers, disperse in an instant, and gather again in a single breath.</t835> <t836>There would also be those who wandered around.</t836> <t837>These would weave in and out among the more stout and motionless ones, become the center of attention of one of the groups in a sharp and cheerful moment, and then, with the excitement of that victory, pass through a sea of faces, voices, and colors, under constantly changing lights.</t837>
<t838>Sometimes, one of these gypsies, while wandering around in her bright, opal-colored dress, would suddenly grab one of the cocktails offered on a tray and, after drinking it in one gulp to boost her courage, would start dancing alone on the spread-out tarpaulin, making strange movements with her hands and arms.</t838> <t839>After a moment of silence, the orchestra conductor would adjust the music to her movements, and among the guests, false rumors would start circulating that the young woman was the understudy of the Revue star Gilda Gray, but it would quickly become clear that this was not true.</t839> <t840>That's when the party would really begin.</t840>
<t841>I believe I was one of the few officially invited guests the first night I went to Gatsby's house.</t841> <t842>People would join the party without waiting for an invitation.</t842> <t843>They would get into the cars that took them to Long Island and find themselves at Gatsby's house.</t843> <t844>Upon arrival, someone who knew Gatsby would introduce them to him, and then they would wander around adopting behaviors suitable for the activities in an amusement park.</t844> <t845>Their entry pass would be the pure intention in their hearts to attend the party.</t845>
<t846>So I really had been invited.</t846> <t847>Early one Saturday morning, a chauffeur in a robin's egg blue uniform crossed the lawn to deliver a formal invitation from his employer.</t847> <t848>It said that it would be a great honor if I attended the 'little party' that night.</t848> <t849>He had seen me many times and had thought of visiting.</t849> <t850>But he had been unable to do so due to some obstacles.</t850> <t851>The ostentatious signature at the bottom corner of the invitation read Jay Gatsby.</t851>
<t852>I wore my white linen suits and around a little past seven, I walked towards his garden.</t852> <t853>After wandering restlessly among the crowds, I also came across a few familiar faces that I occasionally encountered on the suburban train.</t853> <t854>The large number of English people who seemed to be scattered around did not escape my notice either.</t854> <t855>They were all well-dressed.</t855> <t856>There was a hungry expression on their faces.</t856> <t857>Each of them was talking in a low voice and with a serious demeanor to the big, wealthy Americans.</t857> <t858>I was almost certain they were trying to sell something.</t858> <t859>Stocks, insurance policies, or automobiles.</t859> <t860>They had caught the scent of easy money floating around and believed that if they used the right words, they could earn it.</t860>
<t861>As soon as I arrived, I wanted to find the host.</t861> <t862>When a couple of people I asked about his whereabouts gave me strange looks and fervently explained that they didn't know, I immediately retreated to the table where drinks were being served.</t862> <t863>This was the only place where a lonely man could wait without looking friendless and aimless.</t863>
<t864>As he was rapidly advancing on the path to being completely drunk, Jordan Baker appeared at the top of the marble stairs, coming out from inside.</t864> <t865>She slightly pulled back and began to survey the garden with an arrogant demeanor.</t865>
<t866>Rather than uttering polite words to passersby, it seemed more reasonable to approach a familiar person, whether I was welcomed at that moment or not.</t866>
<t867>"Hello!" I called out as I walked towards him.</t867> <t868>My voice had come out a bit too loud, echoing through the garden.</t868>
<t869>“I thought you might be here,” he said as I was going upstairs, “I remembered that you were neighbors.”</t869>
<t870>He shook my hand with a manner devoid of sincerity.</t870> <t871>It was as if he was promising to attend to me in a minute.</t871> <t872>Meanwhile, he was trying to listen to what the two girls, dressed in identical yellow dresses, were saying as they waited on the bottom step of the stairs.</t872>
<t873>"Hello," said the girls, "we're sorry you didn't win!"</t873><t874></t874>
<t875>They were talking about the golf tournament held last week.</t875> <t876>Jordan was eliminated in the finals.</t876>
<t877>"I guess you don't remember us.</t877> <t878>We met here about a month ago," said one of the people in yellow dresses.</t878>
<t879>“You must have dyed your hair, that’s why,” said Jordan.</t879> <t880>I was startled, but since the girls had already walked away, no one but the prematurely born moon heard what was said.</t880> <t881>There was no doubt that this fake moon was also the handiwork of the company that prepared the meals.</t881> <t882>With Jordan’s delicate, golden arm in mine, we descended the stairs and began walking in the garden.</t882> <t883>After a tray of cocktails passed in front of us in the twilight, we sat at a table with those two girls in yellow dresses and three men.</t883> <t884>Each of the men introduced himself as Mr. Mumble.</t884>
<t885>"Do you come to these parties often?" Jordan asked the girl next to him.</t885>
<t886>“I last came to the party where I met you” the girl replied, with a voice full of confidence.</t886>
<t887>“Isn't it the same for you, Lucille?” he asked.</t887>
<t888>It was the same for Lucille.</t888>
<t889>“I like coming here,” said Lucille, “I don't care about what I do.</t889> <t890>That's why I have a good time.</t890> <t891>Last time I came, my dress got caught on a chair and tore.</t891> <t892>Then he asked me for my name and address.</t892> <t893>Within a week, a package from the Courier store arrived at my house with a brand new dress inside.</t893><t894>”</t894>
<t895>“So, did you accept?” asked Jordan</t895>
<t896>“Of course I did.</t896> <t897>I was going to wear it tonight, but the chest part was too big.</t897> <t898>It will need to be altered.</t898> <t899>It's the color of gas flame, adorned with lilac beads.</t899> <t900>Exactly two hundred sixty-five dollars.</t900><t901>”</t901>
<t902>“There must be something strange about someone who does such things,” said the other girl, sincerely, “Apparently, she doesn't want to fall out with anyone.</t902><t903>”</t903>
<t904>"Who doesn't want it?" I asked.</t904>
<t905>“Gatsby.</t905> <t906>Someone told me that...</t906><t907>”</t907>
<t908>Two girls and Jordan leaned forward and huddled together.</t908>
<t909>“Someone had told me that he killed someone in his time.</t909><t910>”</t910>
<t911>We were all filled with excitement.</t911> <t912>The three Mr. Mumbles bent down and started listening with curiosity.</t912>
<t913>"I don't think he went that far," said Lucille doubtfully, "but it might be true that he engaged in German espionage during the war.</t913><t914>"</t914>
<t915>One of the men nodded in approval.</t915>
<t916>“I heard from someone who knows Gatsby very well.</t916> <t917>They tried to convince us by saying their childhood years were spent together in Germany.”</t917>
<t918>“No way!” said the first woman, “it can't be true because he was supposedly serving in the American army during the war.</t918><t919>”</t919>
<t920>When our attention and gazes turned back to him, he leaned in a bit more as if sharing a secret, "Pay attention to him when he thinks no one is watching.</t920> <t921>I bet he has killed someone.</t921><t922>"</t922>
<t923>He squinted his eyes and shivered, Lucille was also shivering.</t923> <t924>We all started looking around for Gatsby.</t924>
<t925>For those who find it difficult to find topics to whisper about in this world, Gatsby was an inspiration for such romantic and mysterious rumors.</t925>
<t926>The first meal service had started - there was another one after midnight.</t926> <t927>Jordan invited me to sit with her group.</t927> <t928>They had spread out at one of the tables on the other side of the garden.</t928> <t929>The group consisted of three married couples and Jordan's companion.</t929> <t930>This latter was a young university student, insistent on making passionate speeches.</t930> <t931>With every gesture, he made it clear that he believed he would eventually win over Jordan's body.</t931> <t932>The group preferred to stay together rather than wander around and chose to represent the dignified suburban society as a whole.</t932> <t933>The East Eggers had graciously approached the West Eggers but were careful not to get caught up in the colorful and lively atmosphere of the place.</t933>
<t934>“Let's get up,” Jordan whispered after a rather boring half hour, “this place is too fancy for me.</t934><t935>”</t935>
<t936>As we were leaving the table, he explained that we were going to find the host of the invitation.</t936> <t937>He didn't know him at all and felt uneasy about it.</t937> <t938>The university student nodded with a mix of irony and sadness.</t938>
<t939>The first place we looked was the bar.</t939> <t940>It was crowded, but Gatsby wasn't there.</t940> <t941>We didn't find him at the top of the stairs or on the veranda either.</t941> <t942>We decided to try our luck at the grand door we came across.</t942> <t943>We found ourselves in a library decorated in Gothic style with English oak furniture adorned with carvings – likely brought from a building in Europe that was damaged during the war.</t943>
<t944>A large, middle-aged man with thick glasses and a sturdy build was sitting at the edge of a table, looking at the books on the shelves.</t944> <t945>He was slightly drunk.</t945> <t946>When he noticed us entering, he turned around excitedly and scrutinized Jordan from head to toe.</t946>
<t947>“What are you thinking?” he suddenly asked.</t947>
<t948>“What about?</t948><t949>”</t949>
<t950>He pointed to the shelves full of books with his hand.</t950>
<t951>“These,” he said, “although you don't need to say anything.</t951> <t952>I have examined them.</t952> <t953>They are all genuine.</t953><t954>”</t954>
<t955>“The books?</t955><t956>”</t956>
<t957>He nodded.</t957>
<t958>"Completely real: They have pages, writings, everything.</t958> <t959>I thought they were just durable, decorative cardboard covers, but they aren't.</t959> <t960>They are all genuine.</t960> <t961>Wait, let me show you.</t961><t962>"</t962>
<t963>He was almost certain that we had doubts.</t963> <t964>He moved towards the shelves and returned with the first volume of the Stoddard Lectures book.</t964>
<t965>“Do you see!” he shouted triumphantly, “This is a real book.</t965> <t966>How wrong I was.</t966> <t967>This man is a true Belasco! This is a great victory.</t967> <t968>What a delightful, what a beautiful choice!</t968> <t969>And he didn't even cut and reduce the pages, knowing his place.</t969> <t970>What more could one ask for?</t970><t971>”</t971>
<t972>1 David Belasco (1853 – 1931) American playwright.</t972> <t973>He had a massive library.</t973> <t974>Translator's Note</t974>
<t975>While snatching the book from my hand and putting it back in its place, he was muttering something about how the entire bookshelf would collapse if a single brick were missing.</t975>
<t976>“Who brought you here?” he suddenly asked, “Or did you just come on your own?</t976> <t977>For example, someone brought me.</t977> <t978>Most of the people here came that way too.</t978><t979>”</t979>
<t980>Jordan was listening to him with a smile on his face but did not respond.</t980>
<t981>“Mrs. Roosevelt brought me.</t981> <t982>Mrs. Claud Roosevelt.</t982> <t983>Do you know her?</t983> <t984>We met last night.</t984> <t985>I've been wandering around drunk for a week and thought maybe if I sat in a library, I might sober up.</t985><t986>”</t986>
<t987>“Did you come to your senses?</t987><t988>”</t988>
<t989>“Eh, a little.</t989> <t990>Still, I'm not quite sure. I mean, not yet.</t990> <t991>Because I've only been here for an hour.</t991> <t992>Did I tell you about these books?</t992> <t993>They are all genuine books.</t993> <t994>Moreover-”</t994>
<t995>“You had mentioned it.</t995><t996>”</t996>
<t997>After shaking hands seriously, we left the place.</t997>
<t998>The dancing session on the canvas tarp in the garden had begun.</t998> <t999>While the elderly gentlemen were pulling and pushing the young girls with rough movements and drawing circles, the harmonious couples were bending and twisting with fashionable moves, trying not to step outside the tarp.</t999> <t1000>Many young women were dancing alone or occasionally taking over the banjos or drums from the orchestra members to let them rest.</t1000> <t1001>As the entertainment peaked around midnight, a famous tenor gave a concert in Italian, and a notorious contralto sang jazz pieces.</t1001> <t1002>Between the two concerts, cheerful, empty laughter echoed in the night air, and the garden was filled with people eager to showcase their talents.</t1002> <t1003>Two girls dressed as twin babies - I later realized they were our friends in yellow dresses - performed their own show.</t1003> <t1004>Champagne was being served in bowl-sized glasses.</t1004> <t1005>The moon had risen high.</t1005> <t1006>The triangular, silver scales floating on the Bosphorus shimmered with the sharp, tinny sound of the banjo playing in the garden.</t1006>
<t1007>I was with Hala Jordan Baker.</t1007> <t1008>We were at the same table with a man around my age and a petite girl with a tough demeanor.</t1008> <t1009>The girl was laughing wildly at every opportunity she got.</t1009> <t1010>I had started to have a bit of fun.</t1010> <t1011>Since I had drunk two glasses of champagne, what I saw seemed meaningful, necessary, and profound.</t1011>
<t1012>At a moment when the fun had stopped, I saw someone smiling at me.</t1012>
<t1013>“Your face doesn't look unfamiliar at all,” he said politely, “were you in the first division during the war?</t1013><t1014>”</t1014>
<t1015>“Yes.</t1015> <t1016>The twenty-eighth infantry regiment.</t1016><t1017>”</t1017>
<t1018>“I was in the sixteenth regiment until June 1918.</t1018> <t1019>I was sure I had seen you before.</t1019><t1020>”</t1020>
<t1021>We talked briefly about France's gray, rainy, and small villages.</t1021> <t1022>I had understood that he lived there.</t1022> <t1023>Because he had said that he bought a seaplane and would try it out tomorrow morning.</t1023>
<t1024>"Would you like to come with me, buddy?</t1024> <t1025>We can take a stroll by the Bosphorus.</t1025><t1026>"</t1026>
<t1027>"What time?"</t1027><t1028>"</t1028>
<t1029>"At the time that suits you best."</t1029><t1030>"</t1030>
<t1031>Just as I was about to ask for his full name, Jordan looked at me and smiled.</t1031>
<t1032>“I see you are having fun now,” he said.</t1032>
<t1033>“Quite a lot, actually.</t1033> <t1034>” Then I turned to my new friend.</t1034> <t1035>“An extraordinary party for me.</t1035> <t1036>I haven't even seen the host yet.</t1036> <t1037>Actually, my house is right over there,” I said, pointing to the barely visible fence in the dark.</t1037>
<t1038>“A man named Gatsby sent an invitation with his chauffeur.</t1038><t1039>”</t1039>
<t1040>For a moment, he looked at me as if he didn't understand anything, then suddenly said, "I am Gatsby."</t1040>
<t1041>“What?” I shouted, “I am very sorry.</t1041><t1042>”</t1042>
<t1043>“I thought you knew, buddy.</t1043> <t1044>I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.</t1044><t1045>”</t1045>
<t1046>A sincere smile that indicated understanding played on his lips.</t1046> <t1047>In fact, it was more than just an understanding smile.</t1047> <t1048>It was one of those rare smiles you might see four or five times in your life.</t1048> <t1049>It could comfort the person in front of him forever.</t1049> <t1050>For a moment, it gave the feeling of having faced eternity and, among all it saw, choosing you and turning towards you.</t1050> <t1051>A smile that understands you as much as you want, believes in you as much as you do, and accepts that you appear to others in your best form!</t1051> <t1052>While I was thinking about these, the smile disappeared.</t1052> <t1053>A man in his thirties, stylishly dressed, and youthful-looking was standing in front of me.</t1053> <t1054>His speech was overly showy, even exaggerated.</t1054> <t1055>Before introducing himself, he gave the impression that he chose his words carefully.</t1055>
<t1056>While Mr. Gatsby was introducing himself, his butler hurriedly came up to him and said that he was being called from Chicago.</t1056> <t1057>As he left us, greeting each of us with a slight nod, he instructed, "If you need anything, let me know, buddy," and added, "I apologize, I will join you again shortly."</t1057><t1058></t1058>
<t1059>As soon as he left, I immediately turned to Jordan.</t1059> <t1060>I thought I needed to explain how astonished I was.</t1060> <t1061>For some reason, I had thought Mr. Gatsby was a middle-aged, red-faced, stout man.</t1061>
<t1062>"Who is this man?"</t1062> <t1063>"Do you know him?" I asked.</t1063>
<t1064>“That's someone called Gatsby.</t1064><t1065>”</t1065>
<t1066>“Where is he from?</t1066> <t1067>And what does he do?</t1067><t1068>”</t1068>
<t1069>"Now, I see that you have also gotten carried away," he said with a faint smile, "once he told me that he studied at Oxford.</t1069><t1070>"</t1070>
<t1071>As things started to take shape in the background, the next sentence erased them all.</t1071> <t1072>"But I didn't quite believe it.</t1072><t1073>"</t1073>
<t1074>“Why?</t1074><t1075>”</t1075>
<t1076>“I don't know,” he said with a determined voice, “I just don't believe what you read there.</t1076><t1077>”</t1077>
<t1078>When she said this, something in her tone reminded me of the other girl saying 'he had killed someone.'</t1078> <t1079>This, however, had completely piqued my curiosity.</t1079> <t1080>Without thinking, I could have said that Gatsby had emerged from the swamps of Louisiana or the suburbs east of New York.</t1080> <t1081>But an obscure young man could not suddenly appear and buy a mansion in a place like Long Island Sound.</t1081> <t1082>At least for someone like me, an inexperienced provincial who doesn't know people very well, it was hard to believe this.</t1082>
<t1083>“Anyway, someone who throws such big parties,” said Jordan, changing the subject with the nonchalance of those civilized people who dislike concreteness, “I also love those big parties.</t1083> <t1084>I find them very sincere.</t1084> <t1085>You can't be comfortable at small gatherings; everyone's eyes are on you.</t1085><t1086>”</t1086>
<t1087>The noise of five drums being played at once was suddenly heard.</t1087> <t1088>The voice of the orchestra conductor rang out, surpassing the conversations in the garden.</t1088> <t1089>“Ladies and gentlemen,” he shouted.</t1089> <t1090>“At the request of Mr. Gatsby, we will play for you the latest work of Mr. Vladimir Tostoff, which received great acclaim at Carnegie Hall in May.</t1090> <t1091>You must have read about the excitement it caused in the newspapers.”</t1091> <t1092>Looking down on all of us a bit, he added, “what enthusiasm it was, my God!” and everyone laughed.</t1092>
<t1093>“The work is called 'Vladmir Tostoff's World Jazz History,'” he concluded with a passionate voice.</t1093>
<t1094>Since my eyes were fixed on Gatsby, I couldn't really focus on Mr. Tostoff's composition.</t1094> <t1095>He was standing on the marble stairs, looking appreciatively from one group to another.</t1095> <t1096>His tanned skin made his well-defined facial features even more prominent.</t1096> <t1097>It was obvious that his short hair was styled every day.</t1097> <t1098>There was nothing intimidating about him at all.</t1098> <t1099>I couldn't help but think that the only thing that set him apart from his guests was that he didn't drink.</t1099> <t1100>Because as the commotion around increased, Gatsby seemed even more composed.</t1100> <t1101>When the 'World Jazz History' concert ended, some of the girls snuggled up to the men like kittens and joyfully rested their heads on their shoulders, while others pretended to faint, hoping someone would catch them.</t1101> <t1102>But no one threw themselves into Gatsby's arms, no French curls touched his shoulder, and he was not found in the groups singing songs in unison.</t1102>
<t1103>"Excuse me"</t1103>
<t1104>Gatsby's servant had suddenly appeared beside us.</t1104>
<t1105>"Are you Mrs. Baker?" he asked, "I'm sorry to bother you, but Mr. Gatsby wants to see you alone.</t1105><t1106>"</t1106>
<t1107>“With me?” said the girl in astonishment.</t1107>
<t1108>“Yes madam.</t1108><t1109>”</t1109>
<t1110>Jordan slowly stood up, raised his eyebrows in surprise, and looked at me, then walked after the butler.</t1110> <t1111>As he left, I noticed that he carried his evening dress as if it were sportswear.</t1111> <t1112>His walk and demeanor were as relaxed as if he were strolling on a golf course in the cool, fresh morning air.</t1112>
<t1113>I was left alone.</t1113> <t1114>It was two in the morning.</t1114> <t1115>For a while, I listened to the incomprehensible but interesting sounds coming from the long room with many windows overlooking the terrace.</t1115> <t1116>Jordan’s university student, who was discussing obstetric topics with two dancer girls, invited me to join them.</t1116> <t1117>But I escaped and went inside.</t1117>
<t1118>The spacious hall was filled with people.</t1118> <t1119>One of the two girls in yellow dresses was playing the piano, while the tall, red-haired young woman next to her was singing.</t1119> <t1120>She had drunk a lot of champagne and, in the middle of the song she was singing, perhaps because she decided that everything was making her very sad, she was crying inappropriately, filling the piece with sobs and hiccups, then continuing to sing from where she left off with her soprano voice trembling.</t1120> <t1121>Tears were forming lines on her cheeks, taking on the color of ink on her bead-filled eyelashes before flowing away, then continuing their path as thin black streams.</t1121> <t1122>When someone mischievously suggested that she sing by looking at the notes forming on her face, she raised her arms and let herself fall into the nearest chair.</t1122> <t1123>She passed out right there.</t1123> <t1124>She had fallen into a deep sleep.</t1124> <t1125>Another girl appeared beside me.</t1125> <t1126>“Just now, she had an argument with someone who said he was her husband,” she informed me.</t1126>
<t1127>I looked around.</t1127> <t1128>Most of the women there were arguing with men who claimed to be their husbands.</t1128> <t1129>Even in Jordan's group – that East Egg foursome – a quarrel had broken out.</t1129> <t1130>One of the men had engaged in a heated conversation with a young actress, and after his wife initially ignored the situation with a proud smile, she had launched an attack.</t1130> <t1131>She slithered up to the man like an angry snake, hissing incessantly, "You promised!"</t1131>
<t1132>The reluctance to go home was not exclusive to drunk men.</t1132> <t1133>The salon was suddenly occupied by two pitifully sober men and their angry wives.</t1133> <t1134>The women were busy commiserating with each other at the top of their voices.</t1134>
<t1135>“Whenever he sees me having fun, he wants to go home.</t1135><t1136>”</t1136>
<t1137>“I have never heard something so selfish in my life.</t1137><t1138>”</t1138>
<t1139>“We are the first to leave every party.</t1139><t1140>”</t1140>
<t1141>“So are we.</t1141><t1142>”</t1142>
<t1143>“Fortunately, we are the last ones leaving tonight,” said one of the men shyly, “the orchestra left half an hour ago.</t1143><t1144>”</t1144>
<t1145>Despite agreeing that such evil could not be endured, the women's argument ended with a brief scuffle.</t1145> <t1146>As their husbands lifted them off the ground, they were kicking into the darkness of the night.</t1146>
<t1147>While I was waiting for the child to bring my hat in the living room, the library door opened.</t1147> <t1148>Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.</t1148> <t1149>As Gatsby was saying the last few things to the girl, their intimate demeanor suddenly turned formal when people came over to bid farewell.</t1149>
<t1150>While Jordan's group was impatiently calling him at the entrance, he shook our hands a bit slowly and whispered in my ear, "I learned something incredible," and then asked, "How long has it been since we came in?"</t1150>
<t1151>“About an hour.</t1151><t1152>”</t1152>
<t1153>“Really unbelievable,” he repeated absentmindedly, “but I swore I wouldn’t tell.</t1153> <t1154>I’ve just gotten your hopes up for nothing.</t1154><t1155>”</t1155>
<t1156>She yawned gently in my face, "Please call me...phone directory...registered under my aunt's name.</t1156> <t1157>Mrs. Sigourney Howard"</t1157>
<t1158>While talking, he was also walking quickly.</t1158> <t1159>As he mingled with his friends waiting at the door, he gave a grand salute with his tanned hand.</t1159>
<t1160>I was embarrassed for staying so long at a house I had come to for the first time.</t1160> <t1161>I joined the last guests gathered around Gatsby.</t1161> <t1162>I wanted to say that I couldn't find him when I came to the party and apologize for not recognizing him when I was in the garden.</t1162>
<t1163>“It doesn't matter at all,” he said immediately, “don't bother your head with these things, buddy,” both his words and the hand patting my shoulder felt more like a routine gesture of politeness than genuine sincerity to me.</t1163>
<t1164>“Don't forget the tour at nine in the morning.</t1164><t1165>”</t1165>
<t1166>At that moment, the servant came and said, "They are calling from Philadelphia, sir."</t1166>
<t1167>“Okay.</t1167> <t1168>One minute.</t1168> <t1169>I'll be right back…</t1169><t1170>Good night”</t1170>
<t1171>“Good night.</t1171><t1172>”</t1172>
<t1173>“Good night,” he said with a smile.</t1173> <t1174>Suddenly, I thought that being one of the last to leave from there was important to him and that he had wanted it, “Good night, buddy... good night.</t1174><t1175>”</t1175>
<t1176>As I was coming down the stairs, I realized the party was not over yet.</t1176> <t1177>A few meters away from the door, a dozen car headlights were illuminating a chaotic and strange scene.</t1177> <t1178>A brand new sports car, with one of its wheels broken after falling into the ditch beside the road, was lying on its side.</t1178> <t1179>It was one of the guests who had left Gatsby's house two minutes earlier.</t1179> <t1180>The wheel had come off due to a sharp protrusion on the wall, and about half a dozen curious drivers had gathered to carefully examine the situation.</t1180> <t1181>Since they had all left their cars in the middle of the road, the discordant, high-pitched sounds of the horns from those stuck in between were grating on the ears, further adding to the chaos.</t1181> <t1182>From the wreckage, a man wearing a long duster coat emerged and stood in the middle of the road.</t1182> <t1183>His eyes, looking pleased but bewildered, shifted from the car to the wheel and then to the onlookers.</t1183>
<t1184>"You see," he was explaining, "it entered the channel.</t1184><t1185>"</t1185>
<t1186>It was obvious that she was very surprised.</t1186> <t1187>First, I noticed this extreme reaction of surprise, and then I realized that I knew the man.</t1187> <t1188>He was a late-night regular of Gatsby's library.</t1188>
<t1189>“How did this happen?</t1189><t1190>”</t1190>
<t1191>He shrugged his shoulders.</t1191>
<t1192>"I don't understand machines at all," he said curtly.</t1192>
<t1193>“So, how did the accident happen?</t1193> <t1194>Did you crash into the wall?</t1194><t1195>”</t1195>
<t1196>"Don't ask me," said the Owl-eyed man, trying to extricate himself from the situation, "I don't really know how to drive, in fact, I don't know at all.</t1196> <t1197>It was just an accident.</t1197> <t1198>That's all I know.</t1198><t1199>"</t1199>
<t1200>“If you are a bad driver, do not try driving at night.</t1200><t1201>”</t1201>
<t1202>“I was using it,” he said a bit hurt, “I wasn't the one using it.</t1202><t1203>”</t1203>
<t1204>A deep silence had settled over those around,</t1204>
<t1205>“Do you want to lose your life?</t1205><t1206>”</t1206>
<t1207>"You're lucky that only the wheel came off!</t1207> <t1208>Not only was he a bad driver, but he also wasn't using it</t1208><t1209>"</t1209>
<t1210>“You don't understand,” he said guiltily, “I wasn't the one driving the car.</t1210> <t1211>There's someone else inside.</t1211><t1212>”</t1212>
<t1213>The astonishment caused by this confession came to life with exclamations of "Aaa!" as the door of the sports car slowly opened.</t1213> <t1214>The crowd - we were completely surrounded - reluctantly pulled back.</t1214> <t1215>There was a strange stillness when the door opened.</t1215> <t1216>A pale-faced, frail man, holding a large dance shoe in his hand, emerged from the wreckage almost piece by piece, clinging to anything he could.</t1216>
<t1217>The ghostly figure, dazzled by the headlights and bewildered by the incessant honking of horns, swayed in place for a while before noticing the man with the long gaiters.</t1217>
<t1218>“What happened,” he asked calmly, “did we run out of gas?</t1218><t1219>”</t1219>
<t1220>"Take a look over there if you want"</t1220>
<t1221>Half a dozen index fingers were pointing at the broken wheel.</t1221> <t1222>After looking for a while, the man must have thought it fell from above, so he lifted his head and looked at the sky.</t1222>
<t1223>"The wheel has come off," someone explained.</t1223>
<t1224>The man nodded his head.</t1224>
<t1225>“I didn't realize we had stopped.</t1225><t1226>”</t1226>
<t1227>Silence again.</t1227> <t1228>After taking a deep breath and straightening his shoulders, the man said in a determined voice, "Is there anyone who can tell me where the gas station is?"</t1228>
<t1229>A dozen or so people, slightly more sober than him, tried to explain that there was no longer a physical connection between the wheel and the car.</t1229> <t1230>A minute passed.</t1230>
<t1231>“Step back,” said the man, “let's turn the car around and restore it to its original state.</t1231><t1232>”</t1232>
<t1233>"But it has no wheels"</t1233>
<t1234>He paused for a moment.</t1234>
<t1235>“There's no harm in trying.</t1235>
<t1236>The blaring of the horns had become unbearable.</t1236> <t1237>I moved away from there, crossed the green area in between, and headed home.</t1237> <t1238>Before reaching, I turned and looked back once more.</t1238> <t1239>The moon shining over Gatsby's house made the night even more beautiful, still giving life to the bright garden where laughter and voices had ceased.</t1239> <t1240>An untimely emptiness emanated from the windows and grand doors, bestowing a great loneliness upon the owner standing on the terrace, raising his hand for a formal farewell.</t1240>
<t1241>When I look at what I have written so far, I realize that my attention was gathered on three separate nights, spaced a few weeks apart.</t1241> <t1242>Yet these were the usual activities of a lively summer season, and until much time had passed, they occupied me far less than my own matters of the heart.</t1242>
<t1243>I spent most of my time working.</t1243> <t1244>In the early hours of the morning, as the sun stretched my shadow westward, I would rush towards Probity Company, passing through the white valleys of New York's lower neighborhoods.</t1244> <t1245>I knew the names of all the clerks and young bond sellers at the company.</t1245> <t1246>We would sit together in dim and crowded diners, eating sausages and mashed potatoes, and drinking coffee.</t1246> <t1247>I even had a small romantic affair with a girl who worked in the accounting department and lived in Jersey City.</t1247> <t1248>When I noticed her brother giving me meaningful looks, I quietly let the matter drop, taking advantage of the girl's vacation in July.</t1248>
<t1249>I usually had my dinner at the Yale Club.</t1249> <t1250>For some reason, it would be the most boring time of the day for me.</t1250> <t1251>Then I would go up to the library on the upper floor and try to gain some knowledge by reading about investments and stocks for about an hour.</t1251> <t1252>There were always a few noisy chatterboxes in the club, but they wouldn't go up to the library.</t1252> <t1253>Therefore, it was a suitable place to work comfortably.</t1253> <t1254>When I finished my work, if the weather was mild, I would walk on Madison Avenue, pass the old Murray Hill Hotel, and reach the Pennsylvania Station from 33rd Street.</t1254> <t1255>Street to Pennsylvania Station.</t1255>
<t1256>I had started to love New York.</t1256> <t1257>The lively, adventurous atmosphere of the nights, the light-shadow plays of women, men, and cars were affecting me.</t1257> <t1258>5.</t1258> <t1259>While walking on the avenue, I would pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that I would enter their lives a few minutes later.</t1259> <t1260>No one would be aware or object.</t1260> <t1261>Sometimes in my imagination, I would follow them to the door of their house at the corner of a hidden street, and just as I was about to enter, I would see them look at me and smile, then disappear into the darkness.</t1261> <t1262>Sometimes, at the sunset of the metropolis, a strange loneliness would fill me.</t1262> <t1263>I would see this in others too.</t1263> <t1264>Loitering in front of shop windows, the poor young clerks waiting for the dinner hour they would spend alone would waste the best moments of the night and life in the twilight.</t1264>
<t1265>At eight in the evening, 40.</t1265> <t1266>Watching the taxis moving stop-and-go in five lanes towards the theater districts on the dim streets of the avenue would make me feel suffocated.</t1266> <t1267>In the waiting cars, people would huddle together and sing songs, laugh at jokes I couldn't hear, and the smoke from the lit cigarettes would surround the invisible multitude of gestures inside.</t1267> <t1268>I would act as if I were impatient to go to the entertainment as well, share their excitement, and at the same time wish for all of them to be happy.</t1268>
<t1269>For a while, I lost track of Jordan Baker.</t1269> <t1270>But towards the middle of summer, we met again.</t1270> <t1271>At first, I was even proud to be seen with her because she was a famous golf champion and well-known.</t1271> <t1272>Over time, other feelings were added to these.</t1272> <t1273>Though I wasn't in love, I felt a warm closeness and interest towards her.</t1273> <t1274>I thought she was hiding something behind her weary attitude towards her surroundings and her somewhat arrogant facial expression—all pretentious behaviors are initially aimed at hiding something.</t1274> <t1275>One day, I learned what it was.</t1275> <t1276>At a house party in Warwick, she had left the borrowed convertible out in the rain and lied about it.</t1276> <t1277>Then suddenly, I remembered the story that hadn't come to mind the night we met at Daisy's house.</t1277> <t1278>In her first major golf tournament, according to a rumor that caused quite a stir and made it to the newspapers, she had moved the ball in the semi-final.</t1278> <t1279>The incident was about to reach scandalous proportions when it was covered up.</t1279> <t1280>The caddy had withdrawn his claim, and the second person who said they witnessed the event admitted they might have been mistaken.</t1280> <t1281>The incident and the name of its protagonist must have stuck in my mind.</t1281>
<t1282>Jordan Baker instinctively stayed away from intelligent and cunning men.</t1282> <t1283>Now I understood why.</t1283> <t1284>She felt safe in environments where it was believed that straying from moral rules was impossible.</t1284> <t1285>She was an incorrigible cheat.</t1285> <t1286>Unable to tolerate being at a disadvantage, she resorted to evasive methods even in her youth, making it a habit to fulfill the desires of her lively, showy body with that cold and arrogant smile she turned to the world.</t1286>
<t1287>From my perspective, nothing changed.</t1287> <t1288>We can't blame a woman too much for her lies.</t1288> <t1289>At first, I felt a bit sad, but then I forgot.</t1289> <t1290>An interesting conversation about driving had taken place at the party that night.</t1290> <t1291>Jordan had driven so close to the workers on the roadside that our fender tore off one of the men's buttons.</t1291>
<t1292>“You are a terrible driver!” I shouted, “Either drive more carefully or don't drive at all.</t1292><t1293>”</t1293>
<t1294>“I am paying attention”</t1294>
<t1295>“No, you don't.</t1295><t1296>”</t1296>
<t1297>"Never mind, the other drivers will pay attention anyway," he said in a joking manner.</t1297>
<t1298>“What does that have to do with anything now?</t1298><t1299>”</t1299>
<t1300>“They will get out of my way.</t1300> <t1301>An accident involves two people.</t1301><t1302>”</t1302>
<t1303>"What if I come across someone as careless as you."</t1303><t1304>"</t1304>
<t1305>"I hope such a thing doesn't happen.</t1305> <t1306>I hate careless people.</t1306> <t1307>That's why I like you.</t1307><t1308>"</t1308>
<t1309>Having grown tired of the sun, without ever taking her gray eyes off the road, she had managed to skillfully divert the direction of our relationship.</t1309> <t1310>For a moment, I thought I was in love with her.</t1310> <t1311>But I was someone who thought a lot and made decisions slowly.</t1311> <t1312>Moreover, I had a lot of rules that restrained my desires.</t1312> <t1313>Therefore, the first thing I needed to do was to free myself from that old current I got caught up in before coming here, to New York.</t1313> <t1314>I wrote her a letter once a week and signed it 'Love, Nick'.</t1314> <t1315>The tiny beads of sweat that would gather on her upper lip while playing tennis still remained vivid in my mind.</t1315> <t1316>There was an unspoken agreement between us.</t1316> <t1317>To feel free, I needed to skillfully break that agreement.</t1317>
<t1318>Every person believes that they possess at least one great virtue.</t1318> <t1319>Mine is being the most honest person among my acquaintances.</t1319>
<t1320>CHAPTER 4</t1320>
<t1321>As the bells rang in the villages along the coast on Sunday morning, the world and its favorite, the Sun, were gleaming joyfully on the lawns of Gatsby's garden.</t1321>
<t1322>The young ladies were saying, "He was smuggling alcohol," while wandering between the landlord's cocktails and the flowers in the garden, "He once killed someone who found out that he was the nephew of Von Hindenburg and the second cousin of the devil.</t1322> <t1323>Pick me a rose from there, darling, and pour a sip of something into that crystal glass.</t1323><t1324>"</t1324>
<t1325>Once, in the gaps of the train schedule, I had written the names of those who came and went to Gatsby's house that summer.</t1325> <t1326>At the top, I had written '5.</t1326> <t1327>July.</t1327> <t1328>1922 program,' and this list had become very old, now starting to tear at the fold lines.</t1328> <t1329>Even so, the faded ink was still readable and probably told much more about these people who had accepted Gatsby's hospitality without making any effort to know him than my generalizations ever could.</t1329>
<t1330>Chester Baker from East Egg and his wife, the Leeches, Bunsen whom I also knew from Yale, Doctor Webster Civet who drowned in the sea last summer in Maine, the Hornbeams, and Willie Voltaire and his wife.</t1330> <t1331>Then there was the Blackbuck family, who gathered in a corner and turned up their noses at anyone who approached them, the Ismays, the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie's wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair supposedly turned white for no reason one winter day.</t1331>
<t1332>If I'm not mistaken, Clarence Endive was also from East Egg.</t1332> <t1333>He had only come once, wearing white golf pants, and had gotten into a fight in the garden with a tramp named Etty.</t1333> <t1334>There were also those who came from the farther parts of the island; the Cheadles, O.</t1334> <t1335>R.</t1335> <t1336>P.</t1336> <t1337>Schraeders, Stonewall Jackson Abrams from Georgia.</t1337> <t1338>The Fishguards and the Ripley Snell couple.</t1338> <t1339>Snell was at Gatsby's just three days before he was thrown in jail: he had gotten so drunk that he passed out on the gravel road, and Mrs. Ulysses Swett ran over his right hand with her car.</t1339> <t1340>The Dancies were also frequent visitors, including S.</t1340> <t1341>B.</t1341> <t1342>Whitebait, who was over sixty at the time, Maurice A.</t1342> <t1343>Flink and the Hammerheads, the tobacco importer Beluga and his daughters.</t1343>
<t1344>The Poles, the Mulreadys, Cecil Roebuck, Cecil Schoen, Senator Gulick, Newton Orchid, the president of Par Excellence Film, Eckhaust, Clyde Cohen, Don S.</t1344> <t1345>Schwartz (son) and Arthur McCarthy from West Egg; all of them were somehow involved in the film industry.</t1345> <t1346>The Catlips, the Bembergs, and G.</t1346> <t1347>Earl Maldoon, the brother of Maldoon who later killed his wife by strangling her, was also among the attendees.</t1347> <t1348>Advertiser De Fontano, Ed Legros, and James B.</t1348> <t1349>(Rot-Gut) Ferret, De Jong and his wife, and Ernest Lilly would come for gambling; Ferret wandering around the garden after quitting the game indicated he was broke and that the value of Associated Traction shares would drop.</t1349>
<t1350>There was also Klipspringer, who came so often that they nicknamed him the boarder; frankly, I doubt he had anywhere else to stay.</t1350> <t1351>Among the guests were Gus Waize, Horace O’Donovan, Lester Myer, George Duckweed, and Francis Bull from the theater world.</t1351> <t1352>Additionally, the Chromes, the Corrigans, the Kellehers, the Dewars, the Scullys, and S. W.</t1352> <t1353>Belcher, the Smirks, the young Quinns who are now divorced, and Henry L. Palmetto, who later committed suicide by jumping in front of a subway car in Times Square, came from New York.</t1353>
<t1354>Benny McClenehan always came with four girls.</t1354> <t1355>Although the girls were different each time, they resembled each other so much that you would inevitably confuse them with those who had come before.</t1355> <t1356>I forgot their names; maybe it was Jacqueline...</t1356> <t1357>It could have been Consuela or Gloria; Judy or June; and when you asked for their last names, they would either give harmonious-sounding flower and moon names or, when pressed, use the family names of famous American capitalists whom they admitted were their cousins.</t1357>
<t1358>Besides these people, I can also mention Faustina O’Brein, who has come at least once, the Baedeker sisters, young Brewer who was shot in the nose during the war, Mr. Albrucksburger and his fiancée Miss Haag, Ardite Fitzpeters, and Mr. P., who was said to have once been the head of the American Legion.</t1358> <t1359>I can also name Mr. Jewett, Miss Claudiz Hipp and her accompanying chauffeur, and a prince whom we called the Duke but whose name I forgot before I could fully learn it.</t1359>
<t1360>That summer, all these people had come to Gatsby's house.</t1360>
<t1361>Towards the end of July, around nine in the morning, Gatsby's dazzling car approached slowly, echoing through the street with its three-note horn, and stopped on the stony road in front of my house.</t1361> <t1362>Even though I had attended two of his parties, ridden on his seaplane, and swum in the sea from his private beach at his insistence, this was the first time he was coming to my house.</t1362>
<t1363>"Good morning, buddy!" he called out. "We're having lunch together today, but how about we go for a walk first?</t1363><t1364>"</t1364>
<t1365>With an unusual American skill brought by not having carried heavy loads in our youth or instead of just sitting, playing ruleless, exciting, and chaotic games, he was balancing on the fender of his car.</t1365> <t1366>This trait always manifested itself in a guise of restlessness that broke through his formal demeanor.</t1366> <t1367>He could never stay still; he would either tap somewhere with one foot to keep a rhythm or move his hands impatiently.</t1367>
<t1368>When he saw me looking at his car with admiration, he jumped off the fender to give me a better view and said, "Nice car, isn't it? Hadn't you seen this before?"</t1368><t1369></t1369>
<t1370>Is it possible not to see, of course I had seen it.</t1370> <t1371>The nickel plating of the extremely long car, with its labyrinths formed by wind shields rising here and there with hats, provisions, and toolboxes, dazzled under the sun in its light cream color.</t1371> <t1372>Behind the multi-layered windshield, almost buried in a greenhouse of green leather, we set off towards the city.</t1372>
<t1373>In the last month, I had tried to chat with him at least five or six times; however, each time I was disappointed, thinking he didn't have much to say.</t1373> <t1374>The impression he left on me when we first met, that he was a mysterious person, had gradually faded; in the end, he had turned into nothing more than the owner of the magnificent mansion next to mine in my eyes.</t1374>
<t1375>I was thinking it was going to be a boring journey.</t1375> <t1376>But before we even reached West Egg, Gatsby had stopped using those fancy phrases and had started tapping his caramel-colored trousers indecisively.</t1376> <t1377>Then suddenly he turned to me and asked, "What do you think of me, buddy?"</t1377> <t1378>I was stunned and tried to brush him off with generalities that would fit such a question.</t1378> <t1379>“It's best if I tell you a few truths about my life,” he interrupted me.</t1379> <t1380>“I don't want you to be misled by the nonsense told about me and get the wrong impression.</t1380><t1381>”</t1381>
<t1382>So, the one who enlivened their parties was also aware of those interesting rumors about themselves.</t1382>
<t1383>"God is my witness, what I'm about to tell you is absolutely true," he said, raising his right hand to reinforce his oath.</t1383>
<t1384>I am the son of a wealthy Middle Western family, now none of them are alive.</t1384> <t1385>I grew up in America, but like all my ancestors, I also went to Oxford; it is a family tradition for us.</t1385><t1386>”</t1386>
<t1387>He looked with a blank stare; at that moment, I understood why Jordan Baker thought he was lying: when he said, "I went to Oxford," he mumbled the words as if it didn't bother him, swallowing them as if choking on them.</t1387> <t1388>Because of my suspicion, what he was saying lost its meaning, and I wondered if there was indeed something a little unsettling in his life.</t1388>
<t1389>Just to ask, I said, "Where in the Midwest are you from?"</t1389>
<t1390>“San Francisco.</t1390><t1391>”</t1391>
<t1392>“So that's how it is.</t1392><t1393>”</t1393>
<t1394>“When I lost everyone in my family, I inherited a large fortune.</t1394><t1395>”</t1395>
<t1396>It was evident from the sorrow in his voice that the sudden loss of his entire family still caused him anguish.</t1396> <t1397>For a moment, I thought he was joking with me, but when I looked at his face, I realized he wasn't.</t1397>
<t1398>“Then, in Paris, Venice, Rome, and all the great cities of Europe, I lived like a prince; collecting precious stones, especially rubies, participating in hunting parties, and painting, even if only for myself, all the while trying to distract myself with the desire to forget that sorrowful event I experienced long ago.</t1398><t1399>”</t1399>
<t1400>I was struggling hard not to laugh.</t1400> <t1401>The stories they told were so familiar that, inevitably, a turbaned figure tracking a tiger in the Boulogne Forest, with sawdust flying everywhere, came to mind.</t1401>
<t1402>“Then the war broke out.</t1402> <t1403>This was actually a great consolation for me; I did everything I could to die, but it was as if my life was protected by a charm.</t1403> <t1404>I was a lieutenant when the war started.</t1404> <t1405>While in the Argonne Forest, I had advanced two machine gun brigades so far at the front that the distance to the infantry companies on either side of us, who couldn't catch up, had exceeded a kilometer each.</t1405> <t1406>We stayed in the area for two days and two nights with one hundred and thirty soldiers and sixteen Lewis guns; when the infantry finally arrived, they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of corpses.</t1406> <t1407>I was promoted to major and received honors from all allied countries, even from that Montenegro.</t1407> <t1408>Imagine, from that little Montenegro in the Adriatic!</t1408><t1409>”</t1409>
<t1410>Oh, from little Montenegro!</t1410> <t1411>He had spoken the words with such elevation, emphasizing each one, and smiled.</t1411> <t1412>From this smile, it was understood that he felt a closeness to the pains in Montenegro's history and the heroic struggle of its people.</t1412> <t1413>This was also an indication that he evaluated this medal, which had come from the loving little hearts of Montenegrins, considering the conditions they were in.</t1413> <t1414>My doubts were now dispersing in a great curiosity, which gave me the feeling of hastily flipping through dozens of magazines.</t1414>
<t1415>He put his hand in his pocket and dropped a coin with a ribbon tied to it into my palm.</t1415>
<t1416>“Here, this is the medal given by Montenegro,” he said.</t1416> <t1417>I was astonished to see that it resembled a real medal.</t1417> <t1418>On it, in a circular shape, it read ‘Orderi di Danilo.</t1418> <t1419>Montenegro Nicolas Rex’.</t1419>
<t1420>“Look behind you too.</t1420><t1421>”</t1421>
<t1422>‘To Major Jay Gatsby – For Displaying Exceptional Heroism’</t1422>
<t1423>“There is also this,” he said, taking a photo out of his pocket, “I always carry this with me in memory of my Oxford days. It was taken in the Trinity Courtyard.</t1423> <t1424>The young man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.</t1424><t1425>”</t1425>
<t1426>In the photograph, there were six young men in sports jackets at an arched passageway with a series of towers visible in the background.</t1426> <t1427>Gatsby was also in the photograph with a cricket bat in his hand; although he looked relatively younger than he does now, he didn't seem to have changed much.</t1427>
<t1428>So what they said was true.</t1428> <t1429>This time, before my eyes, a man trying to bury the agony gnawing at his heart in the crimson depths of a sparkling ruby chest in his palace adorned with tiger skins on the shores of the Grand Canal in Venice had come to life.</t1429>
<t1430>While proudly putting his precious memories into his pocket, he said, "I have an important request from you," "that's why I thought you should get to know me a little."</t1430> <t1431>I don't want you to think that I am an ordinary person.</t1431> <t1432>As you can understand, since I have been wandering around like this to forget that painful event that happened to me, I often find myself among strangers I don't know."</t1432> <t1433>He paused, then soon said, "I will convey my request to you in the afternoon."</t1433>
<t1434>“At dinner?</t1434><t1435>”</t1435>
<t1436>“No, after dinner.</t1436> <t1437>In the meantime, don't think I didn't hear you invite Mrs. Baker for tea.</t1437><t1438>”</t1438>
<t1439>“Or are you trying to say that you are in love with Miss Baker?</t1439><t1440>”</t1440>
<t1441>"Ah buddy, definitely no!</t1441> <t1442>However, Miss Baker graciously agreed to talk to you about this matter.</t1442><t1443>"</t1443>
<t1444>Although I had no idea what the 'matter' was, I must say that at that moment I felt more anger than curiosity.</t1444> <t1445>My intention in inviting Jordan was not to talk about Gatsby.</t1445> <t1446>Moreover, for some reason, I was almost certain that Gatsby's request would be quite strange.</t1446> <t1447>For a moment, I wished I had never set foot in his crowded garden.</t1447>
<t1448>He had closed the subject without saying anything else.</t1448> <t1449>As we approached the city, the silence grew even heavier.</t1449> <t1450>While passing through Roosevelt Harbor, ships with red belts moving forward in the ocean appeared for a moment, then we quickly passed through the cobblestone slums lined with dark bars from the 1900s, whose gilding had faded but had not been abandoned.</t1450> <t1451>As we passed through the Valley of Ashes stretching on both sides of us, I caught a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson struggling with the pump with great determination and vigor.</t1451>
<t1452>We sped down the Long Island road, the car's fenders spread like wings, cutting through the air as if flying and radiating light.</t1452> <t1453>However, halfway there, while navigating the columned curves of the bridge road, we first heard the familiar "pat-pat" sounds of a motorcycle approaching from behind, and then an enraged police officer suddenly appeared beside us.</t1453>
<t1454>Gatsby called out, "Alright, got it buddy," pulled over, and shoved a white business card from his wallet under the man's nose.</t1454>
<t1455>“I understand, sir,” said the policeman, touching his hat and saluting, “Rest assured that I will recognize you next time, Mr. Gatsby, my apologies.</t1455><t1456>”</t1456>
<t1457>“What was that?”</t1457> <t1458>“Did you show a picture from Oxford or something?” I said.</t1458>
<t1459>“I once did a favor for the chief of police, and he, bless him, never fails to send me a greeting card every Christmas.</t1459><t1460>”</t1460>
<t1461>The city appeared on the other side of the river with its white buildings resembling piles of sugar cubes, as the sunlight filtered through the beams of the large bridge and shimmered on the cars moving over it.</t1461> <t1462>It was unknown with what money these buildings were constructed, after all, money has no smell.</t1462>
<t1463>2</t1463> <t1464>The author uses the phrase "non-olfactory money" to reference the Latin saying "Pecunia non olet," which means "money does not smell."</t1464> <t1465>This saying emphasizes that money retains its value regardless of its source.</t1465> <t1466>Sometimes, it also alludes to dubious earnings.</t1466> <t1467>Translator's Note</t1467>
<t1468>Every time I cross the Queensboro Bridge, I look at New York as if I am seeing the city for the first time; its view promises that all the mysteries and beauties of the world are waiting for you there.</t1468>
<t1469>A funeral vehicle adorned with flowers passed by us, followed by two cars with closed curtains, and immediately after, vehicles that did not appear as mournful as the others.</t1469> <t1470>The passengers turned to look at us with sorrowful eyes and the narrow upper lips characteristic of Southeastern Europe.</t1470> <t1471>I was glad that Gatsby’s magnificent car was included in this sorrowful scene.</t1471> <t1472>As we passed Blackwell Island, a limousine driven by a white chauffeur and carrying three Black individuals—two women and one man—dressed in the latest fashion, passed by us.</t1472> <t1473>When they turned their haughty gazes towards us, as if wanting to race, I burst into loud laughter.</t1473>
<t1474>“Remember how we crossed that bridge as if we were flying,” I thought to myself, “now anything could happen...</t1474> <t1475>Absolutely anything!”</t1475> <t1476>Even becoming a man like Gatsby was possible, nothing would surprise me anymore.</t1476>
<t1477>During the noisy lunchtime hours, I met Gatsby for lunch in the basement of a well-ventilated restaurant on 42nd Street.</t1477> <t1478>As I entered from the bright street, blinking my eyes and looking around, I saw him right at the entrance, talking to someone.</t1478>
<t1479>“Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.</t1479><t1480>”</t1480>
<t1481>When the flat and small-nosed Jew lifted his rather large head, the first thing that caught my attention were the tufts of hair protruding from his nostrils, and in that dim light, it was only after a while that I could distinguish his eyes.</t1481>
<t1482>“I glanced at the man,” he said, while firmly shaking my hand.</t1482> <t1483>“What do you think I did next?</t1483><t1484>”</t1484>
<t1485>“What did you do?” I asked politely.</t1485> <t1486>However, she made it clear that she was not talking to me by letting go of my hand and turning her magnificent nose towards Gatsby.</t1486>
<t1487>“After giving the money to Katspaugh, I said, ‘Alright Katspaugh, then don't give him a single penny unless he keeps his mouth shut tight!’ And at that moment, right there, he fell silent.</t1487><t1488>”</t1488>
<t1489>Bay Wolfsheim was about to start a new sentence when Gatsby took both of us by the arm and led us towards the inner parts of the restaurant, upon which the man swallowed his words and his face took on the absent expression of a sleepwalker.</t1489>
<t1490>The head waiter approached and asked, "Would you like some whiskey?"</t1490>
<t1491>“This is a nice place,” said Mr. Wolfsheim, looking at the pictures of women on the ceiling, “still, I prefer the place across the street.”</t1491>
<t1492>Gatsby called the waiter.</t1492> <t1493>“Yes, whiskey,” he said, then turned to Mr. Wolfsheim; “Isn't it very hot there?</t1493><t1494>”</t1494>
<t1495>“You are right, it is warm and small,” said the man, “but it is filled with memories.</t1495><t1496>”</t1496>
<t1497>"Where is this place you mentioned?" I asked.</t1497>
<t1498>“Old Metropole,” said Mr. Wolfsheim to himself, “Full of partings...</t1498> <t1499>With memories of many friends we have bid farewell to for eternity...</t1499> <t1500>I can never forget the night Rosy Rosenthal was shot.</t1500> <t1501>There were six of us.</t1501> <t1502>Rosenthal had been eating and drinking all night, and just as it was almost morning, a waiter approached him with a strange expression on his face and told him that someone was waiting outside to see him.</t1502> <t1503>When Rosenthal said, ‘Okay,’ and tried to get up, I grabbed his arm and sat him back down, saying, ‘If those bastards want you so much, let them come to you, for my sake, don’t go anywhere!’</t1503> <t1504>“It was past four o'clock; if the curtains were opened, we might have seen that it was almost daylight.</t1504><t1505>”</t1505>
<t1506>“So, has Rosenthal left?” I asked innocently.</t1506>
<t1507>“He went out!” Mr. Wolfsheim's nose turned to me in a fury.</t1507> <t1508>“In fact, as he approached the door, he turned to us and said, ‘Watch my coffee, don't let the waiter take it back!’</t1508> <t1509>Then he went outside and stepped off the sidewalk, and at that moment, the men shot him three times in the stomach and fled.</t1509><t1510>”</t1510>
<t1511>“But all four were caught and executed in the electric chair,” I said, recalling.</t1511>
<t1512>“Including Becker, that makes five,” he said, turning his nostrils towards me, “As far as I understand, you are trying to establish some business connections.</t1512><t1513>”</t1513>
<t1514>I was truly surprised by the way these two sentences were connected to each other.</t1514> <t1515>However, Gatsby answered this question in my place, "No, it's someone else.</t1515><t1516>"</t1516>
<t1517>"Is that so?" He seemed disappointed.</t1517>
<t1518>“This gentleman is a friend of mine.</t1518> <t1519>I had told you that we would discuss that matter later.</t1519><t1520>”</t1520>
<t1521>“Sorry, it seems I misunderstood.</t1521><t1522>”</t1522>
<t1523>With the arrival of the delicious dishes, Mr. Wolfsheim had forgotten the sentimental memories of the old Metropole and had hurriedly started eating; he did not neglect to glance around from time to time; finally, he completed his exploration by turning and looking sideways at those sitting behind him.</t1523> <t1524>He probably would have bent down to look under the table if I hadn't been there.</t1524>
<t1525>“This morning in the car,” said Gatsby, leaning towards me, “I didn't upset you, did I?</t1525><t1526>”</t1526>
<t1527>There was that smile on his face again!</t1527> <t1528>But this time I was determined to resist, "Frankly, I don't like secrets," I replied, "I don't understand why you don't tell me what you want directly, why use Miss Baker as an intermediary?</t1528><t1529>"</t1529>
<t1530>"Hey man, don't you dare think this is a shady business!" he tried to encourage me.</t1530> <t1531>"You know that Baker is a great athlete, he never gets involved in wrongdoings.</t1531><t1532>"</t1532>
<t1533>Then he looked at his watch, suddenly jumped up, and left, leaving me alone with Mr. Wolfsheim.</t1533>
<t1534>“Someone needs to make a phone call,” said Wolfsheim as he watched him with his eyes, “Isn't he such a nice person?</t1534> <t1535>Very handsome, and a complete gentleman too.</t1535><t1536>”</t1536>
<t1537>“Yes.</t1537><t1538>”</t1538>
<t1539>“And from Oxford too!</t1539><t1540>”</t1540>
<t1541>“Yes?</t1541><t1542>”</t1542>
<t1543>“Yes, he graduated from Ogsford College in England.</t1543> <t1544>Do you know Ogsford?</t1544><t1545>”</t1545>
<t1546>“I had heard.</t1546><t1547>”</t1547>
<t1548>“It is one of the most famous schools in the world.</t1548><t1549>”</t1549>
<t1550>“How long have you known Gatsby?” I asked.</t1550>
<t1551>“For many years,” he said proudly, “I had the honor of meeting him right after the war.</t1551> <t1552>An hour of conversation was enough for me to understand that the person in front of me was a nobleman.</t1552> <t1553>To myself, I said, ‘This is the kind of gentleman you can invite to your home and introduce to your mother and sister.’”</t1553> <t1554>After pausing for a moment, he said, “I see you are looking at my cufflinks.”</t1554>
<t1555>Actually, I wasn't looking, but naturally, I looked after hearing those words; they resembled ivory, but for some reason, they seemed very familiar.</t1555>
<t1556>“These are perfect examples of human teeth,” he informed me.</t1556>
<t1557>“Very interesting,” I said, examining it more closely, “An extraordinary idea.</t1557><t1558>”</t1558>
<t1559>“Indeed it is!” he said, tugging his cuffs inside his jacket.</t1559> <t1560>“What were we saying, oh yes, Gatsby is extremely careful when it comes to women, he doesn't even glance at his friends' wives.</t1560><t1561>”</t1561>
<t1562>As soon as Gatsby, who had been deemed worthy of this great trust and praise, returned to the table, Mr. Wolfsheim finished his coffee in one gulp and hurriedly stood up.</t1562>
<t1563>“The meal was wonderful.</t1563> <t1564>However, I don't want to overstay my welcome, so it would be best if I leave promptly and let you two young men have some time alone.</t1564><t1565>”</t1565>
<t1566>“There was no need, Meyer,” said Gatsby half-heartedly, while Mr. Wolfsheim raised his hand as if preparing to bless us,</t1566>
<t1567>“You are very kind, but you know, there is a generation gap,” he said with a serious demeanor, “You young people have a lot to talk about among yourselves; the sports you do, the ladies you meet, then…” after raising his hand and waving it once more in an ambiguous gesture, “as for me, I am a man nearing fifty, our time has passed…”</t1567> <t1568>I won't take up more of your time.</t1568><t1569>”</t1569>
<t1570>Then we shook hands, and just as he was turning away, his strange nose seemed to be twitching; I wondered if I had said something that hurt his feelings.</t1570>
<t1571>"He gets sentimental from time to time," Gatsby explained, "and it seems today is one of those days.</t1571> <t1572>He is known in New York, but actually, he is from Broadway.</t1572><t1573>"</t1573>
<t1574>“What does he do?</t1574> <t1575>Is he an actor?</t1575><t1576>”</t1576>
<t1577>“Ah, no.</t1577><t1578>”</t1578>
<t1579>“Dentist?</t1579><t1580>”</t1580>
<t1581>“Is it Meyer?</t1581> <t1582>What nonsense!</t1582> <t1583>He's a gambler,” he said, and after a moment's hesitation, he calmly added, “He is the one who rigged the 1919 Baseball Tournament.</t1583><t1584>”</t1584>
<t1585>“Did he rig the tournament?” I repeated.</t1585>
<t1586>I was astonished by what I heard.</t1586> <t1587>Of course, I was aware of the match-fixing in the 1919 Tournament, but since I probably thought it was just a link in a long chain, I dismissed it by saying it just happened and didn't dwell on it much.</t1587> <t1588>It never crossed my mind that this was orchestrated by a single person, who, with the precision and skill of a safecracker, could deceive fifty million people.</t1588>
<t1589>A little later, I asked, "How did he do it?"</t1589>
<t1590>“He just saw the opportunity and took advantage of it.</t1590><t1591>”</t1591>
<t1592>“So why isn't it inside?</t1592><t1593>”</t1593>
<t1594>“They can't prove it, buddy.</t1594> <t1595>What a cunning man he is!</t1595><t1596>”</t1596>
<t1597>I insisted on the bill; at the moment the waiter brought my change, I saw Tom Buchanan sitting at the other end of the crowded restaurant.</t1597>
<t1598>"Will you accompany me?" I said to Gatsby, "I need to greet someone.</t1598><t1599>"</t1599>
<t1600>At that moment, Tom saw us and took a few steps to come towards us.</t1600>
<t1601>"Where have you been?" he snapped, "Daisy is very upset that you haven't been visiting, just so you know.</t1601><t1602>"</t1602>
<t1603>“This is Mr. Gatsby, and this is Mr. Buchanan,” I introduced them.</t1603>
<t1604>As they shook hands; I had noticed an expression of shame on Gatsby's face that I had never seen before.</t1604>
<t1605>"How are you?" asked Tom, "You didn't come all this way just for the food, did you?</t1605><t1606>"</t1606>
<t1607>“I am with Mr. Gatsby,” I said, turning around, but Gatsby had disappeared.</t1607>
<t1608>"It was the year 1917, an October morning – (Jordan Baker had started to speak, sitting upright in one of the stiff chairs in the tea garden of the Plaza Hotel that same afternoon) – I was walking somewhere, partly on the sidewalk, partly on the grass.</t1608> <t1609>In truth, I was walking more on the grass because I liked how the rubber soles of my English shoes sank into the soft ground.</t1609> <t1610>Whenever my pleated skirt seemed about to flutter in the wind, the red, blue, and white flags hanging on the front facades of the houses would also rise, flapping with a pat-pat-pat sound as if mocking me.</t1610>
<t1611>“Both the largest flags and the largest gardens belonged to Daisy Fay's house.</t1611> <t1612>She is two years older than me, so she was eighteen at the time.</t1612> <t1613>She was the most popular girl in Louisville.</t1613> <t1614>She was always dressed in white, and she even had a white, open-top car.</t1614> <t1615>Every day, their phone at home would ring incessantly, with young officers in training at the nearby camp competing with each other to get a date with her; in fact, they were even willing to settle for a meeting of just one hour.</t1615>
<t1616>“That morning, while passing by her house, I saw her white car parked by the curb.</t1616> <t1617>Daisy was inside, sitting with a lieutenant I saw for the first time that day.</t1617> <t1618>They were so engrossed in each other that Daisy didn't notice my approach until I was just two steps away.</t1618>
<t1619>“Suddenly, I heard him call out, 'Oh, Hello Jordan,' to be honest, I wasn't expecting that at all, 'Come here!</t1619><t1620>'</t1620>
<t1621>“The fact that she wanted to talk to me had honored me; after all, among the older girls, she was the one I admired the most.</t1621> <t1622>‘Are you going to the Red Cross to pack bandages?’ she asked.</t1622> <t1623>I nodded.</t1623> <t1624>She had asked me to convey that she wouldn't be able to come that day.</t1624> <t1625>While she was talking to me, the lieutenant next to her was looking at her with such admiration that every young girl would want to be looked at like that at least occasionally.</t1625> <t1626>His gaze was so romantic that I never forgot that scene.</t1626> <t1627>That lieutenant's name was Jay Gatsby.</t1627> <t1628>For the next four years, I didn't see him again.</t1628> <t1629>In fact, at the end of those four years, when we were introduced in Long Island, I didn't even realize that he was that lieutenant.</t1629>
<t1630>“This happened in 1917.</t1630> <t1631>A year later, I had a few admirers following me.</t1631> <t1632>Meanwhile, I had started playing in golf tournaments, so I rarely saw Daisy.</t1632> <t1633>Even if she went out, she would only be with friends older than us.</t1633> <t1634>Although we didn't see her much, we constantly heard crazy rumors about her.</t1634> <t1635>For instance, according to what was said, one winter night, she was caught by her mother while packing her suitcase to go to New York to say goodbye to an officer who was going overseas.</t1635> <t1636>Of course, she was prevented from going.</t1636> <t1637>It was said that Daisy was so upset with her family that she didn't speak to them for weeks.</t1637> <t1638>According to the rumor, Daisy never saw another soldier after that; she only went out with young men who were flat-footed or nearsighted and thus not drafted.</t1638>
<t1639>“In the fall, she regained her old cheerfulness.</t1639> <t1640>After the signing of the peace, a ball was held in her honor, and she was formally introduced to society.</t1640> <t1641>In February, we heard that she had gotten engaged to someone from New Orleans.</t1641> <t1642>In June, she married Tom Buchanan from Chicago in Louisville, in an unprecedented, magnificent ceremony.</t1642> <t1643>The groom arrived with a hundred people, in four private cars, and took over an entire floor of the Muhlbach Hotel; the night before the ceremony, he gave Daisy a pearl necklace worth three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</t1643>
<t1644>“I was one of the bride's bridesmaids.</t1644> <t1645>When I went up to her room half an hour before the wedding dinner, I found her lying on her bed, looking as charming as the June sun in her floral dress.</t1645> <t1646>She was as drunk as a lord; in one hand she held a bottle of Sauterne, and in the other, a letter.</t1646>
<t1647>‘Aren't you going to congratulate me?’ he said, slurring his words, ‘I had never drunk before, turns out it's such a nice thing.</t1647><t1648>’</t1648>
<t1649>‘Daisy, what's wrong?</t1649><t1650>’</t1650>
<t1651>“I must admit I was very scared; until that moment, I had never seen a girl in such a state.</t1651> <t1652>‘Come here, dear,’ she said, calling me over to her. Then she found the basket on her bed by feel and took out the pearl necklace from it, ‘Take this and return it to its owner, and tell him that I have changed my mind, ‘Daisy is not getting married!’</t1652><t1653>’</t1653>
<t1654>“She was overcome with sobs; she cried and cried.</t1654> <t1655>I rushed outside, found her mother’s maid, then locked the door and put Daisy under a cold shower.</t1655> <t1656>However, she wasn’t convinced to let go of the letter in her hand and went into the bathroom with it.</t1656> <t1657>But when the wet letter she clutched in her palm turned into a soggy ball and started to fall apart, she allowed me to take it from her hand and place it on the soap dish.</t1657>
<t1658>“Then she didn't speak a single word.</t1658> <t1659>We made her smell ammonia, put an ice pack on her head, and then dressed her.</t1659> <t1660>Half an hour later, we left her room together with her wearing a pearl necklace, and the matter was closed.</t1660> <t1661>The next day in the afternoon, at five o'clock, she married Tom Buchanan without even a tremor in her voice.</t1661> <t1662>Then she went on a three-month honeymoon trip to the South Pacific with her husband.</t1662>
<t1663>"After their return, when we met in Santa Barbara, I thought there couldn't be another girl who loved her husband as much as she did.</t1663> <t1664>If Tom left the room even for a minute, she would become restless, looking around for Tom, and that expression on her face wouldn't fade until he returned to the room.</t1664> <t1665>On the beach, Daisy would lay Tom's head on her lap, run her fingers over his eyelids for hours, and watch his face with infinite love as she touched him.</t1665> <t1666>You would be impressed when you saw them together.</t1666> <t1667>It might seem a bit ridiculous, but their demeanor would still captivate you.</t1667> <t1668>This was happening in August.</t1668> <t1669>Shortly after leaving Santa Barbara, I read that Tom had a car accident on the Ventura road.</t1669> <t1670>The front wheel of his car had come off; naturally, the newspapers also mentioned the girl with a broken arm who was with him – this girl was one of the maids at the hotel they were staying at.</t1670>
<t1671>“In April, Daisy gave birth to a baby girl and the family went to France for a year.</t1671> <t1672>I met them one spring day in Cannes, and later in Deauville.</t1672> <t1673>Then the family returned to Chicago and settled there.</t1673> <t1674>You know, Daisy was very well-liked there.</t1674> <t1675>She was always surrounded by rich, young, fast-living, and wild types.</t1675> <t1676>Still, her name was never involved in any scandal, perhaps because she didn't drink.</t1676> <t1677>It's always beneficial to stay sober around people who drink a lot.</t1677> <t1678>First of all, it ties your tongue, so you don't talk too much.</t1678> <t1679>Even better, it allows you to cover up your own faults and mistakes, as no one is in a state to notice you anyway.</t1679> <t1680>Because even if they see, they don't care.</t1680> <t1681>Daisy perhaps never got involved in a love affair.</t1681> <t1682>(There was something in her voice when she said this)</t1682>
<t1683>"Let's not prolong it, about six weeks ago, for the first time in years, I heard the name Gatsby.</t1683> <t1684>Remember when I asked you if you knew Gatsby from West Egg?</t1684> <t1685>Well, that day after you left, Daisy came to my room, woke me up, and asked, 'Which Gatsby?'</t1685> <t1686>When I described the man in my sleepy state, she said with a mysterious air that he could be an old acquaintance.</t1686> <t1687>It was only then that I could relate the lieutenant I had seen with Gatsby in his white car!</t1687><t1688>"</t1688>
<t1689>“When Jordan Baker finished her story, it had been half an hour since we left the Plaza; we were passing through Central Park by carriage.</t1689> <t1690>The sun was setting behind the tall buildings of the West Fifties, where movie stars lived.</t1690> <t1691>The cheerful chirping of the girls, who had already gathered on the grass like cicadas, was rising in that warm twilight.</t1691>
<t1692>I am an Arab Sheikh</t1692>
<t1693>Your heart is now mine</t1693>
<t1694>While you were sleeping at night</t1694>
<t1695>I will come to your tent...</t1695>
<t1696>“Strange coincidence,” I said.</t1696>
<t1697>"Actually, it's not a coincidence!"</t1697><t1698>"</t1698>
<t1699>“What do you mean?</t1699><t1700>”</t1700>
<t1701>“Gatsby deliberately bought that mansion because it was directly across the bay from Daisy's house.</t1701><t1702>”</t1702>
<t1703>“So it wasn't just the stars he was reaching for in the dark that June night.”</t1703> <t1704>Suddenly, Gatsby emerged from that aimless splendor, appearing as if he had come to life.</t1704>
<t1705>“As for his request from you,” Jordan continued, “all he wants is for you to invite Daisy to your house one day and, of course, to accept him as well.</t1705><t1706>”</t1706>
<t1707>His humility in his request had astonished me: He had waited for five years, and then he had acquired that magnificent mansion, which with its light shining like stars would attract the night moths to it.</t1707> <t1708>Was all this just to spend an afternoon with him in a stranger's garden?</t1708>
<t1709>“To answer such a small request, what was the need for me to learn all this?</t1709><t1710>”</t1710>
<t1711>“He is afraid.</t1711> <t1712>He has waited so long.</t1712> <t1713>He is worried that you will be offended.</t1713> <t1714>After all, behind all those behaviors, ultimately he is also a young man.</t1714><t1715>”</t1715>
<t1716>Something was on my mind.</t1716>
<t1717>“Why didn't they want you to arrange this meeting?</t1717><t1718>”</t1718>
<t1719>"Because he wants Daisy to see his house," he explained, "and your house is next to his."</t1719><t1720>"</t1720>
<t1721>“Ah, I understand!</t1721><t1722>”</t1722>
<t1723>“He was probably hoping that Daisy would show up to one of the parties he threw,” Jordan continued, “But that never happened.</t1723> <t1724>Then he started asking around if anyone knew her, trying to hide his feelings.</t1724> <t1725>The first person he found was me.</t1725> <t1726>You remember the party where we ran into each other that day, he wanted to talk to me privately.</t1726> <t1727>You should have seen him, he was stammering just to get a word in.</t1727> <t1728>When I understood the situation, I suggested arranging a lunch in New York, but he was furious.</t1728> <t1729>‘I don’t want to meet her in some far-off, secluded place,’ he had burst out, ‘I want to meet her in the house right next to mine, just beside me.</t1729><t1730>’</t1730>
<t1731>“When he learned that you were Tom's friend, he seemed to back out of his plan.</t1731> <t1732>Even though he has been reading all the Chicago newspapers for years in the hope of finding news about Daisy, he doesn't know Tom very well.</t1732><t1733>”</t1733>
<t1734>The sky had already darkened, and as we passed under a small bridge, I wrapped my arm around her golden shoulder, pulling her close to me, and suggested we go out for dinner together.</t1734> <t1735>Suddenly, both Daisy and Gatsby had vanished from my mind; all I could think about at that moment was this clean, challenging, controlled, and slightly skeptical girl who had nestled against me so recklessly under my arm.</t1735> <t1736>In my head, these words kept spinning with dizzying excitement, “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.</t1736><t1737>”</t1737>
<t1738>“Daisy's life needs a little bit of color,” said Jordan.</t1738>
<t1739>“Does he want to meet Gatsby?</t1739><t1740>”</t1740>
<t1741>“She doesn't know about this meeting, Gatsby doesn't want her to know.</t1741> <t1742>Your only task is to invite her to tea.</t1742><t1743>”</t1743>
<t1744>When we crossed a dark grove, we could see 59th Street, with pale beams of light spilling from its front facade reaching the park.</t1744> <t1745>Since I didn’t have a lover like Gatsby or Tom Buchanan, whose face would flit about in imaginary dark sills or glowing signs, I pulled the girl next to me closer and held her tightly.</t1745> <t1746>When a smile appeared on her pale and mocking lips, I drew even closer to her, bringing her face near mine.</t1746>
<t1747>CHAPTER 5</t1747>
<t1748>That night, as I was coming to West Egg, I was momentarily afraid that my house was on fire.</t1748> <t1749>It was two in the morning, and this corner of the peninsula was sparkling with long lights that fell with a makeshift touch on the bushes and the electric wires by the roadside.</t1749> <t1750>As I turned the corner, I saw that Gatsby's mansion was illuminated from its tower to its cellar.</t1750> <t1751>At first, I thought he was throwing one of his usual wild parties, opening every corner of the house to games like 'hide and seek' or 'sardines in a can.'</t1751> <t1752>But there was no sound.</t1752> <t1753>Only the wind rustling through the trees could be heard.</t1753> <t1754>It was shaking the wires on the poles and flickering the lights.</t1754> <t1755>The house seemed to be winking in the night.</t1755> <t1756>As the taxi I arrived in drove away, I saw Gatsby walking from his garden towards mine.</t1756>
<t1757>"The house has turned into a fairground," I said.</t1757>
<t1758>“Is that so?” he said, looking at the house with absent eyes, “I was glancing into some of the rooms.</t1758> <t1759>Let's go to Coney Island, buddy.</t1759> <t1760>In my car.</t1760><t1761>”</t1761>
<t1762>“It's very late.</t1762><t1763>”</t1763>
<t1764>“So, what do you say about swimming in the pool?</t1764> <t1765>I haven't even dipped my foot in all summer.</t1765><t1766>”</t1766>
<t1767>“I need to go to bed immediately.</t1767><t1768>”</t1768>
<t1769>“Alright.</t1769><t1770>”</t1770>
<t1771>He looked at my face, trying to suppress his excitement.</t1771> <t1772>He waited a bit.</t1772>
<t1773>“I talked to Mrs. Baker,” I said after a while of silence, “Tomorrow I will call Daisy and invite her here for tea.</t1773><t1774>”</t1774>
<t1775>“It wasn't really that important,” he said, trying to appear as if he was downplaying it, “I don't want to bother you with it.</t1775><t1776>”</t1776>
<t1777>“Which day is suitable for you?</t1777><t1778>”</t1778>
<t1779>“Which day is actually convenient for you?” he corrected.</t1779> <t1780>“You know I don't want to trouble you.</t1780><t1781>”</t1781>
<t1782>"How about the day after tomorrow?"</t1782><t1783>"</t1783>
<t1784>After thinking for a moment, reluctantly.</t1784> <t1785>"These grasses need to be cut," he said.</t1785>
<t1786>We both looked at the garden.</t1786> <t1787>Right behind my neglected grass, his dark green, well-kept grass began.</t1787> <t1788>I suspected that he was referring to mine.</t1788>
<t1789>“There is one more small point,” he said.</t1789>
<t1790>"If you want, it can be in a few days."</t1790><t1791>"</t1791>
<t1792>“No, that's not the issue,” he seemed unsure of how to start, “I was thinking...</t1792> <t1793>well, don't get me wrong buddy, but I don't think your earnings are very good.</t1793><t1794>”</t1794>
<t1795>“Not too many.”</t1795><t1796>”</t1796>
<t1797>This had restored his self-confidence.</t1797> <t1798>Now he was speaking more decisively, "I thought so too.</t1798> <t1799>If you don't mind...</t1799> <t1800>you know, I'm also dealing with a small job.</t1800> <t1801>A second occupation, you understand?</t1801> <t1802>Since your earnings are low, I...</t1802> <t1803>you were selling bonds and securities, right buddy?</t1803><t1804>"</t1804>
<t1805>“Yes, I am trying to sell it.</t1805><t1806>”</t1806>
<t1807>"Then maybe such a job would interest you.</t1807> <t1808>It won't take much of your time.</t1808> <t1809>The earnings are good too.</t1809> <t1810>It just requires a bit of secrecy.</t1810><t1811>"</t1811>
<t1812>Now that I think about it, I realize that under different circumstances, the conversation that night could have been a turning point in my life.</t1812> <t1813>But he had so clumsily made it clear that his proposal was a quid pro quo for the service I would provide that I had no choice but to immediately cut him off.</t1813>
<t1814>“I am very busy,” I said, “thank you, but I don't have time to deal with another task.</t1814><t1815>”</t1815>
<t1816>“If you work with Wolfsheim, you won't have to bother with a job.</t1816><t1817>”</t1817>
<t1818>I think he thought I was apprehensive about the connection mentioned during lunch that day.</t1818> <t1819>I assured him that it wasn't the case.</t1819> <t1820>He waited a little longer for me to start a new conversation, but my mind was so occupied that I had no energy to talk.</t1820> <t1821>Upon this, he reluctantly headed home.</t1821>
<t1822>I was happy because of what happened in the evening.</t1822> <t1823>You know, I almost fell into a deep sleep as soon as I walked through the door.</t1823> <t1824>So I don't know if Gatsby went to Coney Island or stayed and continued to check 'some of the rooms' by turning on all the lights in his house.</t1824> <t1825>The next day, I called Daisy from the office and invited her to tea at my house.</t1825>
<t1826>"Don't bring Tom!" I also warned.</t1826>
<t1827>“What?</t1827><t1828>”</t1828>
<t1829>“Don't bring Tom!</t1829><t1830>”</t1830>
<t1831>“Tom who?” he said with an innocent voice.</t1831>
<t1832>On the appointed day, it was raining cats and dogs.</t1832> <t1833>At eleven o'clock, a man wearing a raincoat and dragging a lawn mower behind him knocked on the front door.</t1833> <t1834>When he said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him to cut the grass, I suddenly remembered that I had forgotten to call my Finnish servant that day.</t1834> <t1835>Without wasting any time, I went to the village of West Egg and looked for him in the wet, narrow streets lined with white-painted houses.</t1835> <t1836>Then I bought a few cups, lemons, and a few bunches of flowers and returned home.</t1836>
<t1837>At around two o'clock, when the flowers Gatsby had sent, enough to fill a greenhouse, and vases of every size to put them in, arrived at the door, I realized that I had bought the flowers in vain.</t1837> <t1838>An hour later, he appeared on the threshold in his white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-colored tie.</t1838> <t1839>He was anxious, the pallor of his complexion and the dark circles under his eyes proving that his night had been sleepless.</t1839>
<t1840>"Is everything alright?" he asked as soon as he entered.</t1840>
<t1841>"If you're asking about that, the grass turned out great"</t1841>
<t1842>“What grass?” he asked in astonishment, “Oh, the grass in the front yard.” He moved closer to the window to see, but it was clear from his face that he didn't see anything.</t1842>
<t1843>“It looks very good,” he said vaguely, “one of the newspapers mentioned that the rain would stop around four o'clock.</t1843> <t1844>I think I saw it in the Journal.</t1844> <t1845>Is there anything missing for tea?</t1845><t1846>”</t1846>
<t1847>I took it to the kitchen.</t1847> <t1848>After giving the Finnish woman a cold look, Gatsby and I examined the twelve lemon cakes I bought from the pastry shop.</t1848>
<t1849>“Is there anything missing?” I asked.</t1849>
<t1850>“Alright, everything is very good,” he said, then added in a shy voice, “buddy.”</t1850>
<t1851>Around half-past three, the rain had given way to a damp mist.</t1851> <t1852>Every now and then, small droplets resembling dew would fall.</t1852> <t1853>Gatsby was busy wandering his empty gaze over Clay's Economics book.</t1853> <t1854>Every time he heard the Finnish woman's footsteps shaking the kitchen, he would jump, and sometimes he would look out the window as if there were some invisible, worrying things happening outside.</t1854> <t1855>Finally, he stood up and said in a rather uncertain voice that he was going home.</t1855>
<t1856>“Why then?</t1856><t1857>”</t1857>
<t1858>“No one is coming for tea or anything.</t1858> <t1859>It's getting late!”</t1859> <t1860>He spoke as if he had urgent business elsewhere, “I'm not going to wait here all day!” he said.</t1860>
<t1861>“Don't be ridiculous, there are still two minutes to four.</t1861><t1862>”</t1862>
<t1863>He sat back down with an unhappy expression, as if I had pushed him by the chest and forcibly held him.</t1863> <t1864>Just then, we heard the sound of an approaching motor at the door.</t1864> <t1865>We jumped up from our seats.</t1865> <t1866>I was also tense.</t1866> <t1867>I walked towards the garden.</t1867>
<t1868>An open-top car was approaching the door, passing under the dripping lilac trees.</t1868> <t1869>It stopped near the steps.</t1869> <t1870>The radiant smile of Daisy, who was looking at me from under a three-cornered purple hat, appeared.</t1870>
<t1871>“Do you live here, my dear?” The tantalizing vibrations of her voice mingled with the rain.</t1871> <t1872>For a moment, I waited, doing nothing but listening to this voice.</t1872> <t1873>Her voice rose and fell, a strand of hair stuck to her cheek looked like a stroke of blue paint, and the wet hand I held to help her out of the car sparkled.</t1873>
<t1874>"Or are you in love with me?" he whispered in my ear, leaning in, "Why did you want me to come alone?"</t1874>
<t1875>"This is the secret of Rackrent Castle."</t1875> <t1876>"Tell your driver to leave and come back in an hour."</t1876><t1877>"</t1877>
<t1878>"Come in an hour, Ferdie," he said, then slowly added, "his name is Ferdie."</t1878>
<t1879>“Is your nose affected by gasoline?</t1879><t1880>”</t1880>
<t1881>"I don't think so," he said innocently, "Why did you ask?</t1881><t1882>"</t1882>
<t1883>When we entered, I saw with great astonishment that the living room was empty.</t1883>
<t1884>“This is very funny,” I shouted.</t1884>
<t1885>"What is supposed to be funny?"</t1885><t1886>"</t1886>
<t1887>Hearing the door being gently knocked, Daisy turned her head.</t1887> <t1888>I went and opened the door.</t1888> <t1889>Standing in front of me, with his face as white as a ghost, Gatsby was looking at me with his hands in his pockets and a tragic anger in his eyes, standing on the wet ground.</t1889>
<t1890>He quickly passed by me and dashed into the living room, then, like an acrobat on a tightrope, made a sharp maneuver into the sitting room and disappeared from sight.</t1890> <t1891>What happened was not funny at all.</t1891> <t1892>I felt as if I could hear my own heart beating rapidly.</t1892> <t1893>I closed the door, leaving the increasingly heavy rain outside.</t1893>
<t1894>There was a deep silence that lasted for about half a minute.</t1894> <t1895>At one point, some strange murmurs and a short burst of laughter rose from my living room.</t1895> <t1896>Then I heard Daisy say in an extremely artificial tone, "You have no idea how glad I am to see you again."</t1896>
<t1897>The next silence was frightening and lasted quite a long time.</t1897> <t1898>Since there was nothing to do in the living room, I went inside.</t1898>
<t1899>Gatsby, who still kept his hands in his pockets, was leaning against the fireplace with a supposedly relaxed, forced demeanor, pretending to be somewhat bored.</t1899> <t1900>He was leaning back so far that his head was resting on the broken clock on the mantle.</t1900> <t1901>Without breaking this awkward position, he fixed his piercing gaze on Daisy, who, though a bit frightened, maintained her grace as she sat on the edge of a hard chair.</t1901>
<t1902>"We have met before," murmured Gatsby, turning his gaze to me for a moment.</t1902>
<t1903>He was trying to smile but couldn't manage it.</t1903> <t1904>Just then, as the clock he was leaning his head on toppled over and he faced the danger of it falling, he quickly turned and, with trembling fingers, caught it and put it back in place.</t1904> <t1905>Then he rested his elbow on the arm of the couch, placed his hand on his chin, and sat down.</t1905>
<t1906>“I am sorry about the time,” he said.</t1906>
<t1907>Meanwhile, my face had started to redden and burn as if it had been under a tropical sun.</t1907> <t1908>I couldn't pick and say even one of the thousands of sentences running through my head.</t1908>
<t1909>“It was already old,” I said finally, somewhat foolishly.</t1909>
<t1910>We were acting as if the clock had fallen to the ground and shattered into pieces.</t1910>
<t1911>“We hadn't seen each other for years,” said Daisy, trying to keep her voice as close to the real thing as possible.</t1911>
<t1912>“It will be five years in November.</t1912><t1913>”</t1913>
<t1914>Gatsby's hasty response caused all of us to remain silent for at least another minute.</t1914> <t1915>Upon my desperate suggestion that they come to the kitchen to prepare tea, both of them jumped to their feet, just as my crazy Finnish helper burst in with a tray in hand.</t1915>
<t1916>The anxiety that enveloped us while distributing the cups and cakes had given way to politeness.</t1916> <t1917>Gatsby, who had withdrawn into a corner, kept shifting his tense, unhappy gaze from one of us to the other as I spoke with Daisy.</t1917> <t1918>Since I anticipated that this stagnant atmosphere would not bring any resolution, I asked for permission to step outside as soon as I found the opportunity.</t1918>
<t1919>"Where are you going?" asked Gatsby, suddenly panicking.</t1919>
<t1920>“I will be right back.</t1920><t1921>”</t1921>
<t1922>"I want to talk to you about something before you leave."</t1922><t1923>"</t1923>
<t1924>He came after me, like a madman, into the kitchen and closed the door.</t1924>
<t1925>“Oh, God,” he whispered in pain.</t1925>
<t1926>“What is it, what happened?</t1926><t1927>”</t1927>
<t1928>“This is a big mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a very big one!</t1928><t1929>”</t1929>
<t1930>“You were just a bit shy, that's all,” I said, thankfully adding, “Can't you see that Daisy is shy too?”</t1930>
<t1931>“So, he is afraid too?” he repeated, unable to believe it.</t1931>
<t1932>“Of course.</t1932> <t1933>He is as shy as you are.</t1933><t1934>”</t1934>
<t1935>“Don't speak loudly.</t1935><t1936>”</t1936>
<t1937>“You are acting like a child,” I said, my patience wearing thin, “and that's not all.</t1937> <t1938>By leaving him alone inside, you are being rude.</t1938><t1939>”</t1939>
<t1940>He raised his hand to stop me from saying more.</t1940> <t1941>He looked at me reproachfully, carefully opened the door, and returned to the room.</t1941>
<t1942>I went out the back door and circled around to the front.</t1942> <t1943>Half an hour earlier, Gatsby had done the same thing, running in a semicircle in the rain.</t1943> <t1944>I took shelter under the tree in the front yard, its black trunk full of knots, and its large leaves resisting the raindrops.</t1944> <t1945>The rain had intensified, creating small ponds and swamps in my neglected garden covered with the short grass cut by Gatsby's gardener.</t1945> <t1946>The only place I could see from under the tree was Gatsby's magnificent mansion.</t1946> <t1947>Like Kant gazing at the church bell tower, I stared at it for half an hour.</t1947> <t1948>The building had been constructed ten years ago by a beer manufacturer in accordance with the 'period' fashion.</t1948> <t1949>According to a rumor, he had promised to cover the taxes for a year for the owners of the surrounding cottages if they agreed to thatch their roofs.</t1949> <t1950>The neighborhood's lack of enthusiasm for this family plan must have broken his heart, as his health suddenly deteriorated, and his children sold the mansion without even waiting for the black wreath on the door to be taken down.</t1950> <t1951>Americans occasionally desire to be bound to the land, but they have always resisted being part of the peasant class.</t1951>
<t1952>Half an hour later, when the sun came out, the grocery wagon carrying the servants' dinner - I'm sure Gatsby didn't eat a spoonful of it - appeared in the back yard of the mansion.</t1952> <t1953>The maid opened the windows upstairs.</t1953> <t1954>She appeared at each window for a moment and then disappeared.</t1954> <t1955>When she reached the large window in the middle, she stuck her head out and spat into the garden.</t1955>
<t1956>It was time to return.</t1956> <t1957>While it was raining, I felt as if I could hear the murmurs at home rising and falling with the increasing excitement.</t1957> <t1958>But that new silence seemed to have enveloped the house as well.</t1958>
<t1959>I entered the room, making every kind of noise except throwing the oven to the floor.</t1959> <t1960>But I was sure they hadn't heard anything.</t1960> <t1961>They were sitting at opposite ends of the couch, looking at each other as if one had asked a question and the other was waiting for an answer, or as if the question was still hanging in the air.</t1961> <t1962>The initial shyness had disappeared.</t1962> <t1963>The traces of tears were still on Daisy's cheeks.</t1963> <t1964>When I entered, she jumped up and started wiping them off in front of the mirror.</t1964> <t1965>I couldn't believe the change I saw in Gatsby.</t1965> <t1966>Even while standing still and silent, he was literally glowing, and the light and happiness emanating from him filled the small room.</t1966>
<t1967>"Hey, hello buddy," he said as if we hadn't seen each other in years.</t1967> <t1968>For a moment, I even thought he would shake my hand.</t1968>
<t1969>“The rain has stopped,” I said.</t1969>
<t1970>“Is that so?” Understanding what I meant and seeing the sun streaming into the room, he smiled as if he were a meteorologist or the exuberant master of the entering rays and conveyed the news to Daisy.</t1970> <t1971>“What do you say to this?</t1971> <t1972>The rain has stopped</t1972><t1973>”</t1973>
<t1974>"I'm very happy about this, Jay," she said, her sorrowful yet beautiful voice filled with traces of unexpected happiness.</t1974>
<t1975>“I want you and Daisy to come to my place.</t1975> <t1976>I will show her my house,” said Gatsby.</t1976>
<t1977>“Are you sure you want me to come?</t1977><t1978>”</t1978>
<t1979>“Of course, buddy.</t1979><t1980>”</t1980>
<t1981>Daisy had gone upstairs to wash her face.</t1981> <t1982>For a moment, I felt embarrassed thinking about the state of my towels, but it was too late now.</t1982> <t1983>We started waiting in the garden with Gatsby.</t1983>
<t1984>“My house looks beautiful, doesn't it?” she asked, “Look how nicely the front gets sunlight.”</t1984> <t1985>I confirmed that it was magnificent.</t1985>
<t1986>“Yes,” he said, letting his eyes wander over the arched doors and angular towers of the house, “I earned the money needed to buy it in just three years.</t1986><t1987>”</t1987>
<t1988>“I thought you had inherited it.</t1988><t1989>”</t1989>
<t1990>“Yes, that's right, buddy,” he said without hesitation, “but I lost a significant portion of that money during the great panic.</t1990> <t1991>I'm talking about the panic before the war.</t1991><t1992>”</t1992>
<t1993>I think he wasn't really aware of what he was saying, because when I asked what he did for a living, he said, "That's something for me to know."</t1993> <t1994>He didn't think he had given an inappropriate answer.</t1994>
<t1995>“It can be said that I have done a lot of work,” he tried to correct his mistake.</t1995> <t1996>“First, I was in the pharmaceutical business, then I got into oil.</t1996> <t1997>These days, I have quit both.”</t1997> <t1998>He looked at my face carefully.</t1998>
<t1999>“Are you trying to say that you have thought about my suggestion from the other night?</t1999><t2000>”</t2000>
<t2001>Before I had time to respond, Daisy appeared.</t2001> <t2002>The two rows of brass buttons on her dress were shining in the sun.</t2002>
<t2003>“Are you talking about that huge building?” he shouted, pointing at the mansion with his hand.</t2003>
<t2004>“Did you like it?</t2004><t2005>”</t2005>
<t2006>“I loved it!</t2006> <t2007>But I didn't quite understand how you lived there alone.</t2007><t2008>”</t2008>
<t2009>“I fill it with a lot of interesting people morning and evening.</t2009> <t2010>Interesting people doing interesting jobs, famous faces.</t2010><t2011>”</t2011>
<t2012>Instead of taking the shortcut along the Bosphorus, we went down to the main road and entered through the grand front gate of the mansion.</t2012> <t2013>Daisy was praising the right and left sides of the house or its feudal silhouette rising to the sky with her enchanting voice.</t2013> <t2014>She was captivated by the gardens, the sharp scent of jonquils, the foamy scent of hawthorn and plum blossoms, and the pale yellow fragrance of honeysuckle.</t2014> <t2015>When we reached the marble stairs, it struck me as odd not to see women in colorful dresses going in and out and to hear nothing but the sound of birds in the trees.</t2015>
<t2016>Inside, while wandering through the music rooms furnished in Marie Antoinette style and the salons adorned with antiques from the 17th and 18th centuries, I had the feeling that guests were hiding behind every chair or table and silently waiting until we moved away.</t2016> <t2017>When Gatsby closed the door of the 'Merton University Library,' I almost heard the ghost of the owl-eyed man laughing behind us.</t2017>
<t2018>We went upstairs.</t2018> <t2019>We passed through bedrooms and dressing rooms furnished in various period styles, covered with rose and lilac-colored silks, decorated with fresh flowers, billiard rooms, and bathrooms with built-in tubs.</t2019> <t2020>When we entered one of the rooms, a man with disheveled hair and beard, wearing pajamas, was doing gymnastics exercises.</t2020> <t2021>This was Mr. Klipspringer, who was said to be a 'boarder.'</t2021> <t2022>I had seen him in the morning, wandering on the beach with a look on his face that revealed his hunger.</t2022> <t2023>Finally, we arrived at Gatsby's private suite.</t2023> <t2024>Inside, there was a bedroom, a bathroom furnished in classic Scottish style, and a study in the style of James and Robert Adam.</t2024> <t2025>We sat there and drank a glass of Chartreuse that he took out from a cupboard in the wall.</t2025>
<t2026>Gatsby had not taken his eyes off Daisy for even a moment.</t2026> <t2027>He must have been reevaluating everything in his house based on the reaction he saw in her beautiful eyes.</t2027> <t2028>Sometimes he looked at the items in the house as if none of them were real compared to Daisy's captivating presence.</t2028> <t2029>He had stumbled once while coming down the stairs.</t2029> <t2030>He almost fell.</t2030>
<t2031>The most simply furnished place was the bedroom.</t2031> <t2032>Except for the sets on the dressing table, everything was made of matte pure gold.</t2032> <t2033>When Daisy picked up a brush from there and started to fix her hair, Gatsby sat on a chair and began to laugh, shielding his eyes with his hand.</t2033>
<t2034>"This is the funniest thing I've ever seen, buddy," he said while laughing consecutively, "I can't stop it even if I wanted to...</t2034><t2035>"</t2035>
<t2036>That day had passed through two visible stages and was now about to enter the third.</t2036> <t2037>It had started with shyness and transitioned into an inexplicable joy.</t2037> <t2038>Now, however, he was floundering in amazement at Daisy's presence there.</t2038> <t2039>Having burned with the desire to do this for years, having imagined everything down to the finest detail, and having waited with incredible longing and patience, he had become like a clock whose spring had unwound from being overly wound.</t2039>
<t2040>After a while, he pulled himself together and began to show the suits, dressing gowns, and ties that filled the insides to the brim, by opening the polished doors of the two wardrobes wide open, as well as the shirts carefully folded and stacked like bricks.</t2040>
<t2041>“A man in England buys my clothes.</t2041> <t2042>He selects and sends them to me at the beginning of spring and autumn.</t2042><t2043>”</t2043>
<t2044>He reached for one of the piles of shirts.</t2044> <t2045>The folds of the linen, thick silk, and fine flannel shirts he threw in front of us one by one were getting disheveled as they fell to the ground.</t2045> <t2046>The top of the table soon turned into a colorful flower garden.</t2046> <t2047>While Daisy and I stood in awe, he began to rummage through the other piles.</t2047> <t2048>The soft mound forming on the table was steadily rising.</t2048> <t2049>As I looked at the striped, plaid, coral, apple green, lavender, and orange shirts with his initials embroidered in blue thread on all of them, I suddenly heard a sob.</t2049> <t2050>Daisy was crying, collapsed over the shirts.</t2050>
<t2051>"These are very beautiful," he said, his voice muffled as it was buried in the shirts.</t2051> <t2052>"Suddenly, a sadness enveloped me, because I had never seen such beautiful shirts.</t2052><t2053>"</t2053>
<t2054>After touring the house, we were going to go outside to see the gardens, the swimming pool, the seaplane, and the summer flowers, but when we saw from the window in Gatsby's room that the rain had started again, the three of us went to the window and began to watch the water of the Bosphorus wrinkle with the falling drops.</t2054>
<t2055>"If the weather hadn't been hazy, we could have seen your house across the bay," said Gatsby.</t2055> <t2056>"There is a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.</t2056><t2057>"</t2057>
<t2058>Daisy took his arm, but Gatsby was lost in what he had just said.</t2058> <t2059>Perhaps he was thinking that the great significance he had given to that light had vanished forever.</t2059> <t2060>Compared to the great distance that separated him from Daisy, that light had seemed much closer to the woman, close enough to touch.</t2060> <t2061>As close as the stars are to the moon.</t2061> <t2062>Now it would just be any light at the end of the dock.</t2062> <t2063>One of the enchanting bonds between them had diminished.</t2063>
<t2064>I started walking inside the room.</t2064> <t2065>I was examining objects that I randomly came across in the semi-darkness.</t2065> <t2066>A large photograph of an old man dressed in a captain's uniform, hanging on the wall opposite the desk, had caught my attention.</t2066>
<t2067>"Who is this?"</t2067><t2068>”</t2068>
<t2069>“Oh him? That's Dan Cody, buddy.</t2069><t2070>”</t2070>
<t2071>The name seemed familiar.</t2071>
<t2072>“He is no longer alive.</t2072> <t2073>Years ago, he was my best friend.</t2073><t2074>”</t2074>
<t2075>On the desk was a small photograph of Gatsby, taken when he was eighteen, dressed in a captain's uniform.</t2075> <t2076>He had posed with his head thrown back defiantly, as if challenging the world.</t2076>
<t2077>"I loved this," Daisy shouted.</t2077> <t2078>"Hair pompadour3!</t2078> <t2079>You never told me you styled it like this, nor that you had a yacht, of course.</t2079><t2080>"</t2080>
<t2081>3 Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, Marquise de Pompadour.</t2081> <t2082>The pompadour hairstyle, created by sweeping the hair back, is dedicated to her.</t2082>
<t2083>"Look at these," said Gatsby, "the articles about me in the newspapers and magazines.</t2083><t2084>"</t2084>
<t2085>They were standing side by side, looking at the writings.</t2085> <t2086>Just as I was about to ask about the famous ruby collection, the phone rang.</t2086> <t2087>Gatsby picked up the receiver.</t2087>
<t2088>“Yes.</t2088> <t2089>I can't talk now...</t2089> <t2090>I said I can't talk now, buddy...</t2090> <t2091>I said it was a small town...</t2091> <t2092>he should know what a small town means...</t2092> <t2093>if he thinks Detroit is a small town, then he's no use to us anyway...</t2093><t2094>”</t2094>
<t2095>He hung up the phone.</t2095>
<t2096>“Come here quickly!” Daisy called out, standing in front of the window.</t2096>
<t2097>The rain continued, but the weather had started to clear from the west, and the clouds over the sea had turned into piles of pink and golden foam.</t2097>
<t2098>"Look over there," Daisy said in a whisper, "I wish I could catch one of those pink clouds, put you inside it, and take you for a ride," she continued a minute later.</t2098>
<t2099>When I said that I wanted to leave, both of them said they didn't even want to hear it.</t2099> <t2100>Perhaps my presence with them was comforting.</t2100>
<t2101>"I know what we will do now," said Gatsby.</t2101> <t2102>"I will call Klipspringer here and ask him to play the piano for us.</t2102><t2103>"</t2103>
<t2104>“Ewing!” he called out as he left the room.</t2104> <t2105>A few minutes later, he returned with a shy, lightly dressed, blond young man with thin hair and wearing horn-rimmed glasses.</t2105> <t2106>The man's previously disheveled state was gone.</t2106> <t2107>He was wearing a sporty shirt, rubber shoes, and pale-colored canvas trousers.</t2107>
<t2108>“Did we prevent you from doing gymnastics?” Daisy asked politely.</t2108>
<t2109>“I was sleeping,” Mr. Klipsinger replied hesitantly, “I mean, I dozed off but then I got up and...</t2109><t2110>”</t2110>
<t2111>“Klipsinger plays the piano very well,” said Gatsby, cutting in, “isn't that right, Ewing, old sport?</t2111><t2112>”</t2112>
<t2113>“I don't play very well.</t2113> <t2114>I haven't played for a long time.</t2114> <t2115>I haven't practiced much...</t2115><t2116>”</t2116>
<t2117>“Let's go downstairs,” she interrupted the man again.</t2117> <t2118>As she touched the button, the dark windows disappeared and everything was bathed in light.</t2118>
<t2119>When they entered the music room, Gatsby turned on the lamp standing next to the piano.</t2119> <t2120>After lighting Daisy's cigarette, the two of them sat together on the couch in a dim corner of the room.</t2120> <t2121>The only thing illuminating their surroundings was the polished floor shining with the light coming from the corridor.</t2121>
<t2122>When Klipsinger finished playing the piece titled 'Love Nest,' he turned in a half-circle on the stool and searched for Gatsby in the dark with his sorrowful eyes.</t2122>
<t2123>"My fingers are not ready, you saw it too.</t2123> <t2124>I told you I couldn't play well, regular practice...</t2124><t2125>"</t2125>
<t2126>“Don't talk too much, just play, buddy!” ordered Gatsby.</t2126>
<t2127>In the mornings</t2127>
<t2128>In the evenings</t2128>
<t2129>Didn't we have a lot of fun...</t2129><t2130>’</t2130>
<t2131>A strong wind was blowing outside, and the sound of lightning striking over the distant sea could be heard.</t2131> <t2132>The sky had darkened, and lights had started to come on in West Egg.</t2132> <t2133>Trains loaded with people coming from New York were passing through the rain, dropping everyone off at their homes.</t2133> <t2134>It was the busiest hour of the day.</t2134> <t2135>A great excitement and rush had enveloped the surroundings.</t2135>
<t2136>‘One thing is certain, more than anything else,</t2136>
<t2137>The rich make money, the poor make children</t2137>
<t2138>These days,</t2138>
<t2139>Between times...</t2139><t2140>'</t2140>
<t2141>When I went to them for Veda, I noticed that the astonishment had returned and settled on Gatsby's face as it had when they first met.</t2141> <t2142>It seemed that some doubts had arisen in his mind about his happiness at that moment.</t2142> <t2143>After all, five long years had passed!</t2143> <t2144>Even on that day, he must have seen something in Daisy that did not match the person he had kept alive in his imagination.</t2144> <t2145>This did not mean that the girl had done something wrong, of course.</t2145> <t2146>The real reason was that Gatsby had magnified her in his mind over the years.</t2146> <t2147>His imagination had surpassed everything, including Daisy.</t2147> <t2148>Because with the creativity of his passion, he had let himself into a world of imagination, constantly adding new images, adorning it with every bright feather that came his way.</t2148> <t2149>Nothing can destroy what a lonely person accumulates in their imagination, no fresh passion, no new fire.</t2149>
<t2150>While Durmuş was looking at him, Gatsby changed his stance.</t2150> <t2151>When Daisy took his hand into her palms, she whispered something into his ear.</t2151> <t2152>Gatsby turned to her excitedly.</t2152> <t2153>It must have been her voice that affected him the most.</t2153> <t2154>That undulating, burning hot voice could not be exalted even by dreams.</t2154> <t2155>It was an immortal melody.</t2155>
<t2156>They both had forgotten me.</t2156> <t2157>Daisy lifted her head and reached out her hand, but Gatsby acted as if he didn't know me.</t2157> <t2158>I looked at them once more, and they looked back at me.</t2158> <t2159>They had gone far away, experiencing intense emotions.</t2159> <t2160>Then I left the room, walked down the marble stairs, and walked towards my home in the rain.</t2160>
<t2161>CHAPTER 6</t2161>
<t2162>In those days; one morning, an ambitious young reporter from New York knocked on Gatsby's door and asked if he had anything to say.</t2162>
<t2163>Gatsby asked politely, "About what?"</t2163>
<t2164>"I don't know, you might have something to say.</t2164><t2165>"</t2165>
<t2166>After five long minutes of continuing in such a strange manner, the matter was understood.</t2166> <t2167>The young journalist had heard Gatsby's name mentioned in the office, in connection with a link that he either avoided explaining at that moment or perhaps did not fully grasp.</t2167> <t2168>Taking advantage of that day being his day off, with a commendable initiative, he had headed straight to Gatsby's house.</t2168>
<t2169>Actually, there was no basis for it, but still, his instincts had proven right.</t2169> <t2170>The rumors on the tongues of hundreds of people, who thought they had a say over his past just because they took advantage of his hospitality, had branched out so much over the summer that Gatsby was almost about to make it to the newspapers.</t2170> <t2171>His name was mentioned along with urban legends, like an underground pipeline said to extend all the way to Canada.</t2171> <t2172>According to another rumor, he supposedly lived not in a house but on a luxurious ship he had built in the shape of a house, secretly cruising up and down the Long Island shores.</t2172> <t2173>It was not easy to understand how such rumors could be a source of satisfaction for James Gatz from North Dakota.</t2173>
<t2174>4 When alcohol production and sale were banned in America, one of the many fantastic methods devised to smuggle alcohol into the country was ÇN</t2174>
<t2175>James Gatz, at least his real name, or rather his legal name, was this.</t2175> <t2176>At the age of seventeen, in the early years of stepping into life, he decided to change his name the moment he saw Cody's yacht anchored on the shore of Lake Superior.</t2176> <t2177>That afternoon, walking along the shore of the lake in his torn green sweater and canvas pants, he was James Gatz.</t2177> <t2178>He immediately arranged for a boat and rowed to the Tuolomee, then climbed onto the deck of the yacht to warn Cody that a storm was approaching and that if he didn't leave within half an hour, his yacht could be shattered.</t2178>
<t2179>He had probably chosen this name before.</t2179> <t2180>He always despised his poor farmer family, never accepting them as his mother and father.</t2180> <t2181>In fact, Jay Gatsby, who lived in West Egg, Long Island, was born from a platonic conception of himself.</t2181> <t2182>He was the son of God – whatever that meant, that was its meaning.</t2182> <t2183>As a son, he had to fulfill his duty to his father by serving a vast, rough, and flamboyant beauty.</t2183> <t2184>That is why he created a Jay Gatsby that only a seventeen-year-old boy could create, but he remained faithful to this dream to the end.</t2184>
<t2185>For more than a year, he had been harvesting mussels and fishing for salmon along the southern shores of Lake Superior, working here and there just for food to find a place to stay.</t2185> <t2186>He spent his active life intertwined with nature, sometimes pushing his sun-darkened muscular body to the limit, sometimes surrendering to laziness.</t2186> <t2187>Spoiled by the constant attention of women he had known from an early age, he had come to disdain them; he scorned young virgins for their ignorance, and the others for losing themselves in their infatuation with him, a reaction they had by nature to someone who only cared about himself.</t2187>
<t2188>However, a never-ending turbulent chaos reigned in his heart.</t2188> <t2189>When night fell, the most unlikely and unimaginable thoughts swarmed into his bed.</t2189> <t2190>As the wet light of the moon wandered among the ticking of the clock above the sink and over the clothes he had tossed around, an indescribably magnificent universe rose in his mind.</t2190>
<t2191>Every night, until sleep came to close those colorful scenes and make them forgotten, another dream was added to these, expanding this universe even further.</t2191> <t2192>These dreams, which for a time served as an outlet for his creative power, provided a satisfying sign of the unreality of reality, telling him that the foundation of the world rested on the wings of a fairy girl.</t2192> <t2193>A few months earlier, driven by an instinct that could be considered a herald of future fame and fortune, he had enrolled at St.</t2193> <t2194>Olaf Lutheran College in southern Minnesota.</t2194> <t2195>However, he left this school after only two weeks, disillusioned by the indifferent drumbeats of fate, and even fate itself, and because he hated the janitorial job he took to pay for school expenses.</t2195> <t2196>He returned to Lake Superior, and from that day on, he searched for work until he saw Dan Cody's yacht anchored in shallow waters.</t2196>
<t2197>At that time, Cody, who was in his fifties, had come from the silver mines of Nevada and the Yukon region.</t2197> <t2198>Since 1875, he seemed to have tracked down every kind of mine.</t2198> <t2199>He had made millions from the copper mines of Montana.</t2199> <t2200>Although his physical health and appearance were in good condition, the same could not be said for his mental health.</t2200> <t2201>Numerous women who had sensed this had made great efforts to get hold of the man's fortune.</t2201> <t2202>The same had happened in his tumultuous love affair with journalist Ella Kaye.</t2202> <t2203>After Kaye, who had discovered Cody's weaknesses, adopted the manners of Madame de Maintenon, the man had set sail with his yacht to save himself, which provided good material for the tabloid press in the year 1902 when the incident occurred.</t2203> <t2204>Until that encounter at Little Girl Bay that would change the fate of James Gatz, Cody had roamed from bay to bay for a full five years.</t2204>
<t2205>This yacht, by letting go of the oars and looking at the deck surrounded by railings, was a symbol of all the beauty and splendor in the world for Gatz; it must have been enough for him to lift his head and smile at the man to get what he wanted – he had discovered long ago that his smile had an effect on people.</t2205> <t2206>Cody asked him some questions, and the answer he gave to one of these questions became the new name he would use from that day forward.</t2206> <t2207>Cody immediately noticed the intelligence and ambition in the boy.</t2207> <t2208>A few days later, he took Gatz to Duluth and bought him a blue jacket, six white trousers, and a yachtsman's cap.</t2208> <t2209>Before long, when the Tuolomee set sail for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast, Gatsby was on its deck.</t2209>
<t2210>It was hard to discern exactly what Yatta was doing; sometimes he was a steward, sometimes an assistant captain, and at other times a clerk, or even a guard.</t2210> <t2211>For sober Dan Cody knew very well what he might do when he got drunk, and thus, he increasingly relied on Gatsby to prevent potential disgrace.</t2211> <t2212>They lived this way for five years; during this period, the yacht circled the European coasts three times.</t2212> <t2213>This lifestyle would likely have continued if Ella Kaye hadn't shown up that day they docked in Boston, and if Dan Cody hadn't died within a week, displaying a rather unwelcoming behavior.</t2213>
<t2214>The portrait of this impressive man with gray hair, a stern but expressionless face, and rosy cheeks still lingers in my mind, hanging in Gatsby's bedroom.</t2214> <t2215>He was an incorrigible rake, known for his hedonism; in a period of American life, he had brought the brutalities of brothels and gambling dens from the wild frontier regions back to the balls on the eastern shores.</t2215> <t2216>Indirectly, it was Cody who caused Gatsby's aversion to alcohol.</t2216> <t2217>Sometimes at those wild parties, when women poured champagne over their hair, Gatsby later chose to stay away from alcohol.</t2217>
<t2218>As for the famous inheritance, all that was left from Cody to Gatsby was a mere twenty-five thousand dollars, but he couldn't even get that money.</t2218> <t2219>He never learned how the lawyers had schemed to prevent him from touching the inheritance.</t2219> <t2220>Cody's millions were transferred as they were to Ella Kaye, without Gatsby even laying a hand on them.</t2220> <t2221>What remained for him were the experiences he had gone through, and during this time, his vague outlines filled with solidity and strength, emerging as a man.</t2221>
<t2222>He had told me all of this much later, yet I found it appropriate to recount these to dispel the rumors that had nothing to do with the truths about his ancestors.</t2222> <t2223>Moreover, at the times he was telling me these, my mind was in turmoil, and I had reached a point where I was confused about what to believe.</t2223> <t2224>Therefore, to correct misunderstandings, I wanted to take advantage of this pause where Gatsby had momentarily caught his breath.</t2224>
<t2225>Actually, there had been a pause in our relationship as well.</t2225> <t2226>I had neither seen him nor spoken to him on the phone for a few weeks.</t2226> <t2227>I was mostly spending that time by following Jordan to New York and trying to get into the good graces of her senile aunt.</t2227> <t2228>Finally, one Sunday afternoon, I visited him at his home; I had barely been there for two minutes when a few people dropped by.</t2228> <t2229>Tom Buchanan had also tagged along with these guests to have a drink.</t2229> <t2230>Naturally, I was uncomfortable; on the other hand, I couldn't help but be surprised that this hadn't happened before.</t2230>
<t2231>This group of three, consisting of Tom, someone named Sloan, and an attractive woman in a brown riding outfit, had stopped by while they were out for a ride.</t2231> <t2232>The woman had been here before.</t2232>
<t2233>“I am very pleased that you stopped by,” said Gatsby, welcoming them on his porch, “what a nice surprise, I'm glad you came.</t2233><t2234>”</t2234>
<t2235>As if they cared!</t2235>
<t2236>“Please, come in, please.</t2236> <t2237>Would you like a cigarette or a cigar?” While walking around the room, he didn't forget to press the servant's bell a few times, “I'll have the whiskeys prepared right away.</t2237><t2238>”</t2238>
<t2239>She was actually shaken by Tom's arrival, yet she wouldn't be comfortable if she didn't offer them something.</t2239> <t2240>Even though she wasn't sure, she could guess that they came there just for the drinks.</t2240> <t2241>Still, Mr. Sloane didn't take anything.</t2241> <t2242>"Lemonade?</t2242><t2243>"</t2243>
<t2244>“No, thank you.</t2244><t2245>”</t2245>
<t2246>“At least have some champagne?</t2246><t2247>”</t2247>
<t2248>“Thank you very much, I will not take it.”</t2248><t2249>”</t2249>
<t2250>"How was the walk?</t2250><t2251>"</t2251>
<t2252>"The roads on this side are very good.</t2252><t2253>"</t2253>
<t2254>"I prefer the car - "</t2254>
<t2255>“I understand.</t2255><t2256>”</t2256>
<t2257>Finally, Gatsby, turning to Tom who had been introduced to him as if he were a stranger and was sitting silently, forced himself to say:</t2257>
<t2258>“If I'm not mistaken,” he managed to say, “we've met before, Mr. Buchanan.</t2258><t2259>”</t2259>
<t2260>“Ah, of course,” said Tom, with a polite but uneasy manner; it was clear he did not remember, “Yes, you are right, I remember very well.</t2260><t2261>”</t2261>
<t2262>“It was about two weeks ago.</t2262><t2263>”</t2263>
<t2264>“Okay, you were with our Nick.</t2264><t2265>”</t2265>
<t2266>"I know your wife too," Gatsby blurted out suddenly, defiantly.</t2266>
<t2267>"Really?"</t2267><t2268>"</t2268>
<t2269>Tom turned to me and asked, "Do you live nearby, Nick?"</t2269>
<t2270>"Right next door."</t2270><t2271>"</t2271>
<t2272>“Oh, really?</t2272><t2273>”</t2273>
<t2274>Mr. Sloane, who had arrogantly settled into a chair, was not participating in the conversation.</t2274> <t2275>The woman wasn't saying much either.</t2275> <t2276>However, after her second glass, she suddenly became more friendly.</t2276>
<t2277>"I suggest we all come together to your next party, Mr. Gatsby.</t2277> <t2278>What do you say?</t2278><t2279>"</t2279>
<t2280>"Of course, please go ahead, I would be very pleased."</t2280><t2281></t2281>
<t2282>"You are very kind, that would be great," said Mr. Sloane, but he didn't seem very grateful, "Well, shall we get going now?</t2282><t2283>"</t2283>
<t2284>“You're welcome, what's the rush?” insisted Gatsby; he had somewhat composed himself and now wanted to get to know Tom better, “Why don't you stay for dinner?</t2284> <t2285>There will surely be other guests coming from New York as well.</t2285><t2286>”</t2286>
<t2287>“Why don't you come to dinner with me?</t2287> <t2288>Both of you,” the lady said sincerely, referring to me as well.</t2288> <t2289>At that moment, Mr. Sloane stood up, “Let's go now,” he said to the woman.</t2289>
<t2290>“I would really like you to come,” insisted the woman, “I’m serious, we have plenty of room at the table.</t2290><t2291>”</t2291>
<t2292>Gatsby looked at me with questioning eyes; it was clear that he wanted to go to the invitation, but he hadn't realized that Mr. Sloane would not be pleased about it at all.</t2292>
<t2293>“I'm afraid I won't be able to join you,” I said.</t2293>
<t2294>“You should come,” the woman insisted, turning to Gatsby.</t2294>
<t2295>After Mr. Sloane leaned in and mumbled something into her ear, the woman responded loudly: "If we leave immediately, we can make it!</t2295><t2296>"</t2296>
<t2297>"I don't have a horse," said Gatsby, "I have ridden while I was in the army, but I never bought a horse.</t2297> <t2298>Still, I can follow you by car.</t2298> <t2299>Please give me a minute," he said, leaving the room.</t2299>
<t2300>We also went out to the veranda; Sloane and the woman withdrew to a corner and engaged in an intense conversation.</t2300>
<t2301>At that moment, Tom said, "I can't believe the man actually came. Doesn't he understand that the woman doesn't want him?"</t2301><t2302></t2302>
<t2303>“But the woman said with her own mouth what she wanted.</t2303><t2304>”</t2304>
<t2305>“Tonight is a big feast; he doesn't know any of the guests,” he continued, frowning, “Where did he meet Daisy?”</t2305> <t2306>You might call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion, women these days are out and about too much.</t2306> <t2307>Then they end up meeting such rascals here and there.</t2307><t2308>”</t2308>
<t2309>Then the woman and Mr. Sloane went down the stairs and mounted their horses.</t2309> <t2310>Sloane called out to Tom, "Come on, hurry up! We're very late, we must leave now."</t2310> <t2311>Then he turned to me and said, "Please tell him that we're in a hurry and can't wait, okay?"</t2311>
<t2312>We shook hands with Tom and bid farewell to the others with a cold gesture.</t2312> <t2313>The guests had just disappeared among the trees, riding their horses swiftly down the driveway, when Gatsby appeared at the door with his hat and overcoat in hand.</t2313>
<t2314>Tom must have been suspicious of Daisy wandering around alone, as they came together to Gatsby's party on Saturday night. The reason for the strange tension noticeable that night was probably Tom.</t2314> <t2315>Out of all the parties Gatsby threw that summer, this is the only one that remains in my mind, likely due to that tension I mentioned.</t2315> <t2316>The usual people had come – or rather, the people who came were of the usual type – once again we had plenty of champagne, and once again the party was dominated by a colorful and noisy chaos; however, there was an unpleasant atmosphere, a tension that never quite released, which I hadn't felt at the previous ones.</t2316> <t2317>Perhaps I had grown accustomed to these parties by starting to see West Egg, with its unique standards and types, as a world of its own that could easily defy the outside world because it didn't care about anything beyond itself.</t2317> <t2318>That night, I was looking at everyone and everything at the party through Daisy's eyes.</t2318> <t2319>Seeing things that we find contrary to our own values from a new perspective always saddened me.</t2319>
<t2320>When Daisy and Tom arrived, the sun was about to set.</t2320> <t2321>As they wandered together among the colorful crowd, Daisy was chirping something with her wonderful voice.</t2321>
<t2322>“Places like this excite me so much,” she whispered, “if you want to kiss me in the middle of the night, don't hesitate to tell me, Nick, we'll find a way.</t2322> <t2323>Just saying my name is enough or showing this green card...</t2323><t2324>”</t2324>
<t2325>“Just take a look around,” Gatsby said to Tom.</t2325>
<t2326>“I am already watching, and I am having a lot of fun.</t2326><t2327>”</t2327>
<t2328>"You will see many celebrities you know"</t2328>
<t2329>After casting his conceited glances around, he said, "We don't go out much at night," and added, "I must admit, when you asked, I also thought I didn't know a single person."</t2329><t2330>"</t2330>
<t2331>“You surely know this lady,” said Gatsby, pointing to an extremely attractive woman sitting majestically under a blossoming plum tree, resembling an orchid more than a human.</t2331> <t2332>Seeing a star they could only see in movies, alive and in person, had excited Tom and Daisy just like everyone else.</t2332>
<t2333>“A very beautiful woman,” said Daisy</t2333>
<t2334>“The man next to her, leaning towards her, is also the director,”</t2334>
<t2335>Later, in a ceremonial manner, he began to parade them around, from one group to another.</t2335>
<t2336>“This is Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Buchanan,” he paused for a moment, “Mr. Buchanan is a famous polo player.</t2336><t2337>”</t2337>
<t2338>Tom interrupted by objecting, "He's joking, I'm not."</t2338>
<t2339>Gatsby must have liked this manner of introduction, for that night Tom was introduced to everyone as the 'famous polo player.'</t2339>
<t2340>"I have never seen so many celebrities together," Daisy shouted excitedly, "I really liked that man over there - what was his name?</t2340> <t2341>You know, the one with the bluish nose...</t2341><t2342>"</t2342>
<t2343>After Gatsby revealed the man's identity, he also added that he was a small-scale producer.</t2343>
<t2344>“Anyway, I liked the man.</t2344><t2345>”</t2345>
<t2346>Tom interrupted with a laugh, "I guess I should give up on becoming a famous polo player," he said.</t2346> <t2347>"I would prefer to be more indifferent towards all these celebrities.</t2347><t2348>"</t2348>
<t2349>Daisy and Gatsby danced.</t2349> <t2350>Gatsby's elegant yet unpretentious moves during the Foxtrot had astonished me; I had never seen him dance before.</t2350>
<t2351>Then they slipped through the garden into the garden of my house and sat on the steps in front of the door for about half an hour.</t2351> <t2352>At Daisy's request, I kept watch in the garden; she had explained the reason for her request by saying, "You never know, a flood might come, a fire might break out... The world is full of all sorts of possibilities, isn't it?</t2352><t2353>"</t2353>
<t2354>Tom's indifference seemed to have passed, as he sat down to eat with the other guests and asked, "You don't mind if I eat with that group over there, do you? There's someone among them, you should hear the funny stories he has!</t2354><t2355>"</t2355>
<t2356>Daisy said with a smile, "Of course, go ahead, you might need to take someone's address, let me give you my small gold fountain pen too."</t2356><t2357>"</t2357>
<t2358>When her husband walked away, she turned to me and said, "The girl is a bit vulgar, but she's beautiful."</t2358> <t2359>I realized that, apart from the half hour she spent alone with Gatsby, she didn't have much fun.</t2359>
<t2360>Everyone at our table was tipsy, and I was responsible for it because it was my suggestion to go to that table.</t2360> <t2361>Gatsby was called to the phone at one point, and I was looking at these people I had fun with just two weeks ago, thinking about how the things I liked then were now bothering me.</t2361>
<t2362>“Your health isn't bad, is it, Mrs. Baedeker?</t2362><t2363>”</t2363>
<t2364>The girl who was the subject of this question had been trying to rest her head on my shoulder for quite some time.</t2364> <t2365>When she heard her name, she lifted her head and opened her eyes, "What?</t2365><t2366>"</t2366>
<t2367>She answered on behalf of Mrs. Baedeker, a large, sluggish woman who insisted on playing golf at the city club the next day, "Don't worry, she'll come around soon.</t2367> <t2368>Whenever she downs five or six cocktails, this happens.</t2368> <t2369>Yet, I've told her countless times to quit drinking.</t2369><t2370>"</t2370>
<t2371>"But I don't drink anymore," the girl defended herself.</t2371>
<t2372>"Of course, my dear, when I heard your cries, I even reported the situation to Doctor Civet,"</t2372>
<t2373>“I am sure she is grateful to you, but,” another person interrupted, “I still wish you hadn't dipped her head into the pool, the poor girl's lovely dress is soaking wet.</t2373><t2374>”</t2374>
<t2375>“If there is one thing I truly hate, it is having my head dunked in the pool!” grumbled Mrs. Baedeker, “One time in New Jersey, they almost drowned me.</t2375><t2376>”</t2376>
<t2377>"Then you will absolutely have to quit alcohol as well," the Doctor attempted to say.</t2377>
<t2378>“You should look at yourself first!” Mrs. Baedeker retorted.</t2378> <t2379>“Your hands are shaking, man!</t2379> <t2380>If I needed surgery, I would never agree to let you do it.</t2380><t2381>”</t2381>
<t2382>So it went on like this.</t2382> <t2383>The last thing I remember is watching the famous star with the film director, side by side with Daisy.</t2383> <t2384>They were still under that plum tree, their faces now so close to each other that the faint moonlight could barely seep through.</t2384> <t2385>We couldn't help but think that the man had slowly inched closer to the woman throughout the night to reach this point.</t2385> <t2386>As we stood there watching them, the director moved a millimeter closer and finally kissed the woman on the cheek.</t2386>
<t2387>“I like this woman very much,” said Daisy, “Magnificent!”</t2387>
<t2388>However, everything except this woman had gotten on his nerves; the fact that he reflected his discomfort in his emotions rather than his actions made it impossible to argue about it.</t2388> <t2389>He had been disgusted by West Egg, this unparalleled 'place' that Broadway had derived from this fishing village of Long Island.</t2389> <t2390>He was horrified by the raw vitality behind those old literary words and this slimy fate that drove all these people from one nothingness to another in the shortest way possible.</t2390> <t2391>Behind this simplicity, he saw something terrible that he struggled to comprehend.</t2391>
<t2392>While waiting for their cars, I had sat down with them at the bottom of the stairs: It was dark, the bright light spilling from the open street door illuminated only a few square meters in the sweet twilight of the morning.</t2392> <t2393>From time to time, a shadow would fall on the closed curtain of the dressing room, then it would be replaced by another shadow, freshening its powder and lipstick in an invisible mirror.</t2393>
<t2394>“Who is this Gatsby character?” Tom asked suddenly, “Is he a bootlegger?</t2394><t2395>”</t2395>
<t2396>"Where did you hear this from?" I asked.</t2396>
<t2397>“I haven't heard it from anyone, but it's obvious.</t2397> <t2398>You know that most of these new rich people are bootleggers,”</t2398>
<t2399>"Not Gatsby," I said briefly.</t2399>
<t2400>He did not answer, the gravel laid on the road was crunching under his feet.</t2400>
<t2401>“So, he must have worked very hard to gather this herd of wild animals.</t2401><t2402>”</t2402>
<t2403>As the wind gently fluttered the gray fur on her collar, Daisy said, forcing herself, "At least they're more interesting than the people around us."</t2403>
<t2404>“But you didn't seem very interested.</t2404><t2405>”</t2405>
<t2406>“Yes, they caught my attention.</t2406><t2407>”</t2407>
<t2408>Tom turned to me laughing, "Did you see the look on Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put herself under a cold shower?"</t2408><t2409></t2409>
<t2410>Daisy, in a low and rhythmic whisper, began to hum a song, imbuing each word with new meanings that it had never carried before and would never carry again.</t2410> <t2411>When the melody rose, her voice would falter, then continue in a manner typical of contralto voices, gently releasing each changing note, adding the warm magic of her soul.</t2411>
<t2412>“Most people come uninvited,” he suddenly said, “that girl was one of them.</t2412> <t2413>They just show up without warning, and out of politeness, he doesn't turn any of them away.</t2413><t2414>”</t2414>
<t2415>“I really wondered who he was and what he did,” insisted Tom, “and I think I will find out somehow.</t2415><t2416>”</t2416>
<t2417>“Let me enlighten you right away,” Daisy replied, “He is in the pharmaceutical business, or rather, he has a chain of pharmaceutical markets.</t2417> <t2418>He did it all by himself.</t2418><t2419>”</t2419>
<t2420>The delayed car finally approached slowly.</t2420>
<t2421>“Good night,” said Daisy.</t2421> <t2422>She turned her gaze away from me and looked at the open door behind us, from which the melodies of the beautiful and short waltz, “Three in the Morning,” one of the beloved songs of the year, were coming.</t2422> <t2423>Despite everything, there were romantic possibilities at Gatsby’s casual parties that did not exist in Daisy’s world.</t2423> <t2424>What was calling her back in the song?</t2424> <t2425>What would happen in these dark, unpredictable hours?</t2425> <t2426>Perhaps a very young, dazzling, and even dizzyingly beautiful woman would appear and turn her lively gaze towards Gatsby; and, caught up in the magic of the moment, who knows, perhaps the loyalty and dependency that had not diminished for five years would suddenly vanish.</t2426>
<t2427>I stayed until late that night.</t2427> <t2428>Gatsby had asked me to wait until the guests had left.</t2428> <t2429>So I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party on the dark beach ended with the guests running home in a frozen state and all the lights in the guest rooms went out.</t2429> <t2430>When he finally came to me, his sunburned face was unusually tense, and his sparkling eyes were tired.</t2430> <t2431>Then:</t2431>
<t2432>“He didn't like it,” he said.</t2432>
<t2433>“Of course, he liked it.</t2433><t2434>”</t2434>
<t2435>“No, he didn't like it at all,” he insisted, “he didn't have any fun either.</t2435><t2436>”</t2436>
<t2437>Then he/she fell silent, I could feel the sadness that had enveloped him/her.</t2437>
<t2438>“I feel very distant from him,” she said, “it's hard to explain to him.</t2438><t2439>”</t2439>
<t2440>“Are you referring to the dance?</t2440><t2441>”</t2441>
<t2442>“Dance?” He snapped his fingers and dismissed everything related to dance from his mind, “No buddy, dance is not important at all,”</t2442>
<t2443>He was not willing to settle for anything less than Daisy confronting Tom and saying, "I never loved you."</t2443> <t2444>After erasing the four years spent with him with this sentence, they would decide on one of the more convenient solutions.</t2444> <t2445>For instance, after Daisy gained her freedom, they could go to Louisville and get married there; just as they had planned five years ago, Daisy could get married from her own home.</t2445>
<t2446>“But she can't understand these,” he said, “it wasn't like this before, we used to sit for hours-</t2446><t2447>”</t2447>
<t2448>He couldn't continue, and started pacing back and forth on the road littered with discarded fruit peels and crushed flowers.</t2448>
<t2449>“If I were you, I wouldn't get my hopes up too much,” I said, gathering my courage, “the past is in the past, you can't bring it back.</t2449><t2450>”</t2450>
<t2451>“Can't we bring it back!” he exclaimed with suspicion, “No, of course we can.</t2451><t2452>”</t2452>
<t2453>As if it were hidden in a dark corner of his past home, he scanned his surroundings with wild eyes, as if reaching out would touch it, "I will do this, I will restore everything to its former state," he said, nodding his head with conviction, "He will see this too!</t2453><t2454>"</t2454>
<t2455>Then, he talked about the past for a long time; it was as if he wanted to fix something about himself, related to leaving when he was in love with Daisy.</t2455> <t2456>His later life was disordered and chaotic; however, he was hopeful that if he could go back to a certain time in the past and then slowly move forward through all those days again, he would find what he was looking for.</t2456>
<t2457>Five years ago, on an autumn night when the leaves were falling, while wandering the streets, they came to a treeless avenue and stopped on a sidewalk illuminated by the moonlight.</t2457> <t2458>They turned and looked into each other's faces.</t2458> <t2459>That mysterious excitement, encountered only twice a year when the seasons change, had dominated the cool night.</t2459> <t2460>As the faint lights in the windows of the houses filtered into the darkness of the night, the stars seemed to be in a hurry, constantly twinkling; when Gatsby glanced out of the corner of his eye, he had indeed seen a staircase made of cobblestones climbing towards a hidden realm at the tops of the trees.</t2460> <t2461>If he could have climbed there, he could have absorbed the essence of life waiting for him at the peak and sipped the unique milk of miracles.</t2461>
<t2462>As Daisy's radiant face approached his, his heart was pounding wildly.</t2462> <t2463>After kissing her and surrendering his indescribable dreams to her mortal breath, his thoughts would never again surge and play like those in God's mind. Listening to the sound of a tuning fork striking a star, he waited with these thoughts for a moment.</t2463> <t2464>Then he kissed her.</t2464> <t2465>At the moment their lips met, the girl blossomed for him like a flower, and creation was complete.</t2465>
<t2466>Despite its eerie sentimentality, as he was recounting these, I remembered something; a melody I had heard who knows when, and a few lost words I couldn't place...</t2466> <t2467>For a moment, a word began to form in my mouth.</t2467> <t2468>As if there was more than just a wisp of air touching my tongue, my lips moved in vain like a mute person.</t2468> <t2469>The words I vaguely remembered remained unsaid.</t2469>
<t2470>CHAPTER 7</t2470>
<t2471>At a time when interest and curiosity about her had peaked, I saw that the lights of her house were off on a Saturday night.</t2471> <t2472>Just as Gatsby had mysteriously appeared suddenly as a Trimalchio5, he had vanished in the same way.</t2472> <t2473>I later noticed that the cars heading towards the mansion for fun were grumbling and turning back after a few minutes.</t2473> <t2474>Thinking he might be ill, I went to his house.</t2474> <t2475>A butler with a treacherous face, whom I had never seen before, opened the door and scrutinized me with narrowed eyes and suspicion.</t2475>
<t2476>5 Trimalchio.</t2476> <t2477>A character in the novel Satyricon written by Petronius during the Roman period.</t2477> <t2478>He was famous for the lavish dinners he hosted.</t2478> <t2479>Translator's Note</t2479>
<t2480>“Is Mr. Gatsby uncomfortable?</t2480><t2481>”</t2481>
<t2482>After saying "No," he added the word "sir" with some difficulty.</t2482>
<t2483>“He hasn't been seen for a while, so I got worried.</t2483> <t2484>You say Mr. Carraway has arrived.</t2484><t2485>”</t2485>
<t2486>"Kim?" he asked in a rough manner.</t2486>
<t2487>"Carraway"</t2487>
<t2488>“Carraway.</t2488> <t2489>Alright, okay, I'll tell him.</t2489><t2490>”</t2490>
<t2491>He slammed the door in my face.</t2491>
<t2492>My Finnish, that Gatsby had dismissed all the servants working at home a week ago, and that the six people he had hired in their place did not go down to the village to avoid taking bribes from the West Egg tradesmen, instead ordering a reasonable amount of food and drink by phone.</t2492> <t2493>She had heard from the grocer's apprentice that the kitchen had turned into a stable, and also added that the prevailing opinion in the neighborhood was that the newcomers did not quite resemble servants.</t2493>
<t2494>The next day, Gatsby called me.</t2494>
<t2495>"Are you going somewhere?" I asked.</t2495>
<t2496>“No, buddy.</t2496><t2497>”</t2497>
<t2498>“I heard that he fired his servants.</t2498><t2499>”</t2499>
<t2500>“I wanted people who wouldn't gossip.</t2500> <t2501>Daisy often comes in the afternoons, you know.</t2501><t2502>”</t2502>
<t2503>So, the grand caravanserai had collapsed like houses made of playing cards because of the displeasure he saw in Daisy's eyes!</t2503>
<t2504>"The newcomers are actually a family that Wolfsheim wants to help.</t2504> <t2505>They are all siblings.</t2505> <t2506>They used to run a small hotel.</t2506><t2507>"</t2507>
<t2508>“I understand.</t2508><t2509>”</t2509>
<t2510>He said that Daisy had asked him to call me.</t2510> <t2511>Would I come to lunch at the Buchanans' tomorrow?</t2511> <t2512>Miss Baker would also be there.</t2512> <t2513>Half an hour later, Daisy called as well.</t2513> <t2514>She was very happy to hear that I would come.</t2514> <t2515>Something was going on.</t2515> <t2516>But I didn't think they were waiting for that day to cause a scene, especially to carry out that strange plan Gatsby had explained in the garden that night.</t2516>
<t2517>The next day, the weather was so hot that everywhere was scorching.</t2517> <t2518>It was definitely the hottest day of the summer, perhaps the last hot day.</t2518> <t2519>When the suburban train I was on emerged from the tunnel into the light, the only thing piercing the unbearable heat of the midday sun was the sharp whistle sound from the factory chimney of the National Biscuit Company.</t2519> <t2520>The wicker seats of the carriage I was in were burning hot from the heat.</t2520> <t2521>After sweating gently for a while under her white blouse, the woman sitting next to me surrendered to the extreme heat with a desperate cry when the newspaper between her fingers became soaking wet.</t2521> <t2522>At that moment, when she dropped her handbag to the ground, she shouted, "Damn it!"</t2522>
<t2523>I was tired and exhausted, but I bent down, picked up the bag from the ground, and handed it to the woman.</t2523> <t2524>To show that I had no bad intentions, I had made sure to hold it by the fingertips, keeping it away from myself.</t2524> <t2525>But everyone around us, including the woman, had their eyes fixed on me with suspicion.</t2525>
<t2526>“Hot!” muttered the conductor, looking at familiar faces, “What weather! Hot! Hot!...</t2526> <t2527>Hot! Does it feel hot to you too?</t2527> <t2528>Hot?</t2528> <t2529>Hot...</t2529><t2530>”</t2530>
<t2531>When he returned my ticket, I saw that his fingerprint was on it.</t2531> <t2532>In this heat, do you think anyone cares whose lips they've kissed or whose head they've rested on the chest pocket of their pajamas!</t2532>
<t2533>…While waiting with Gatsby in front of the open door of the Buchanans, a gentle breeze from the living room brought the sound of the ringing telephone to us.</t2533>
<t2534>“Did you say the gentleman's body?” the servant was shouting into the receiver, “I'm sorry ma'am, but we can't do it today, it's noon right now and we can't touch anything because of the heat!</t2534><t2535>”6</t2535>
<t2536>The author continues his thoughts about the heat in the train by having the servant express them, thus sharing this imagination with the reader.</t2536> <t2537>In the next line, he conveys the servant's real conversation on the phone.</t2537> <t2538>Translator's Note</t2538>
<t2539>In reality, he was saying, "Yes... yes... I understand."</t2539> <t2540>When he came over to get our straw hats after putting the receiver back, his face was covered in sweat.</t2540>
<t2541>“The lady is waiting in the living room,” he said, pointing us in the direction with an unnecessary gesture.</t2541> <t2542>In this heat, every extra gesture felt like an insult to one's life energy.</t2542>
<t2543>The living room, with its shutters tightly closed, was dim and cool.</t2543> <t2544>Daisy and Jordan, in their white dresses, were sprawled on a large couch, surrendering themselves to the buzzing breeze of the fans.</t2544> <t2545>They looked like silver statues.</t2545>
<t2546>"We can't move," they shouted in unison.</t2546>
<t2547>Jordan placed his bronze hand, which he had powdered to prevent sweating, in my palm for a moment.</t2547>
<t2548>"Where is the famous athlete Mr. Thomas Buchanan?" I asked.</t2548>
<t2549>At the same time, we heard Tom's muffled and low voice talking on the phone inside.</t2549>
<t2550>Gatsby was standing in the middle of the red carpet, looking around as if mesmerized.</t2550> <t2551>As Daisy looked at him and let out one of her sweet, thrilling laughs, a fine puff of powder rose from her chest and mingled with the air.</t2551>
<t2552>“The person who keeps calling is said to be Tom's girlfriend,” Jordan whispered in my ear.</t2552>
<t2553>We were all silently waiting.</t2553> <t2554>The voice coming from the hallway rose in anger.</t2554>
<t2555>“Alright then, I won't sell you that car either...</t2555><t2556>I don't have to do this...</t2556> <t2557>and I won't tolerate you bothering me about it during meal time!</t2557><t2558>”</t2558>
<t2559>"Shutting the mouth of the fool," Daisy mocked.</t2559>
<t2560>"No, he isn't," I assured, "this is a real job interview, I am aware of it too.</t2560><t2561>"</t2561>
<t2562>Tom, who opened the door with a rush, stood at the threshold for a moment with his thick body, then quickly entered the room.</t2562> <t2563>“Mr. Gatsby,” he said, extending his large, flat hand.</t2563> <t2564>He was good at hiding that he didn't quite like him, “I'm glad to see you, sir...</t2564> <t2565>Nick, hello...</t2565><t2566>”</t2566>
<t2567>"Why don't you prepare us something cold to drink?" Daisy called out.</t2567>
<t2568>When Tom left the room, she stood up and went to Gatsby, bringing her face close to his and kissed him on the lips.</t2568>
<t2569>"You know that I love you," she murmured.</t2569>
<t2570>“You forget that there is a woman here,” said Jordan.</t2570> <t2571>Daisy looked around suspiciously.</t2571>
<t2572>"Then you kiss Nick too," he said.</t2572>
<t2573>“She is neither vulgar nor simple.</t2573><t2574>”</t2574>
<t2575>“I don't care,” shouted Daisy, as she stood in front of the brick fireplace for a while.</t2575> <t2576>Then, remembering how hot it was, she sat back down on the couch with a guilty expression on her face, as a nanny in a pressed uniform entered with a little girl.</t2576>
<t2577>"My precious," Daisy said, opening her arms, "come to your loving mother.</t2577><t2578>"</t2578>
<t2579>The child, who let go of the nanny's hand, ran to his mother and stood by her dress, shyly.</t2579>
<t2580>“My precious, has your mother sprinkled powder on your blonde hair?</t2580> <t2581>Come on, get up and ask the guests 'how are you'.</t2581><t2582>”</t2582>
<t2583>Gatsby and I bent down and shook the little hand that the reluctant girl extended.</t2583> <t2584>Gatsby, without taking his eyes off the girl, was gazing at her with astonished looks.</t2584> <t2585>I think until that moment, he hadn't really believed in her existence.</t2585>
<t2586>"I would change my clothes for dinner," said the child excitedly, looking at his mother.</t2586>
<t2587>“Because your mother wants to show you off to everyone,” he said, bringing his face closer to the single line on the girl's tiny, white neck.</t2587>
<t2588>“You are the angel of my dreams.</t2588> <t2589>You are my dream.</t2589><t2590>”</t2590>
<t2591>“Yes,” said the child in a calm voice, “Aunt Jordan's dress is also white.</t2591><t2592>”</t2592>
<t2593>"So, how did you find mommy's friends?"</t2593> <t2594>Daisy took the little one by the shoulders and turned her face towards Gatsby.</t2594> <t2595>"Did you like them?</t2595><t2596>"</t2596>
<t2597>"Where is my father?"</t2597><t2598></t2598>
<t2599>“He doesn't look like his father at all,” Daisy explained, “He looks just like me.</t2599> <t2600>Especially, he got his hair and face shape from me.</t2600><t2601>”</t2601>
<t2602>When Daisy sat back down, the nanny stepped forward and extended her hand.</t2602>
<t2603>"Come, Pammy."</t2603><t2604>"</t2604>
<t2605>“Bye bye, my dear.</t2605><t2606>”</t2606>
<t2607>The well-mannered little girl, after looking back once, reluctantly took her nanny's hand.</t2607> <t2608>As the woman led her to the door, Tom entered following the servant who was carrying four tall glasses filled with ice.</t2608>
<t2609>Gatsby took his drink.</t2609>
<t2610>“It really looks cold,” he said with obvious unease.</t2610>
<t2611>We started drinking the beverages quickly with large gulps.</t2611>
<t2612>“I read somewhere that the sun gets a little hotter every year,” said Tom with the air of a polite host, “the world will soon fall into the sun – wait a minute – I think it was the other way around.</t2612> <t2613>That is, the sun gets a little colder every year,” he said</t2613>
<t2614>"Come outside," he suggested to Gatsby, "I want you to see the surroundings.</t2614><t2615>"</t2615>
<t2616>I also stepped out onto the veranda with them.</t2616> <t2617>In the green waters of the Bosphorus, under the heat, a sailboat was slowly gliding towards fresher waters.</t2617> <t2618>Gatsby, who watched it with his eyes for a while, reached out his hand and pointed to the opposite shore.</t2618>
<t2619>“I am sitting right in front of you.</t2619><t2620>”</t2620>
<t2621>“Yes, it seems so.</t2621><t2622>”</t2622>
<t2623>Our eyes wandered over rose beds, grass scorched by the sun, and debris left from the hot days of summer stretching along the shore.</t2623> <t2624>The white wings of the boat were receding, dividing the skyline.</t2624> <t2625>Further ahead lay the choppy ocean and a multitude of islands, big and small.</t2625>
<t2626>“This is real sport for you,” said Tom, nodding his head, “I would have liked to be there next to that man, even if only for an hour.</t2626><t2627>”</t2627>
<t2628>We ate lunch in the living room.</t2628> <t2629>The room was dim when the curtains were tightly drawn to keep it cool.</t2629> <t2630>We were sipping our beers in a tense cheerfulness.</t2630>
<t2631>“What would you like to do this afternoon?” shouted Daisy, “Or tomorrow or the day after, or even for the next thirty years.</t2631><t2632>”</t2632>
<t2633>“Don't be ridiculous,” said Jordan, “life starts anew when the weather cools down in the fall anyway.</t2633><t2634>”</t2634>
<t2635>“But it's so hot,” insisted Daisy, almost on the verge of tears, “and everything is so complicated.”</t2635>
<t2636>Let's all go down to the city together!</t2636><t2637>"</t2637>
<t2638>The sound was forcing its way through the heat, reshaping it.</t2638>
<t2639>"I had heard of people converting barns into garages," Tom was saying to Gatsby, "but I am the first person to convert a garage into a barn.</t2639><t2640>"</t2640>
<t2641>“Who wants to go to the city?” Daisy was saying stubbornly.</t2641> <t2642>When Gatsby's gaze shifted that way, she continued, “You look very good.”</t2642>
<t2643>Their eyes met and they looked at each other for a long time as if they were the only two in the universe.</t2643> <t2644>Then Daisy, with great effort, turned her eyes to the table.</t2644>
<t2645>“You always look good anyway,” he repeated what he said.</t2645>
<t2646>Tom Buchanan saw them just as she was saying she loved him.</t2646> <t2647>He was surprised, stunned!</t2647> <t2648>He opened his mouth and looked first at Gatsby, then once more at Daisy.</t2648> <t2649>It was as if he had seen someone he knew from long ago.</t2649>
<t2650>“You look like the man in that advertisement,” Daisy continued innocently, “you know, the man who acts in those commercials.</t2650><t2651>”</t2651>
<t2652>“Okay,” Tom suddenly interrupted, “I want to go to the city too.</t2652> <t2653>Let's all go together.</t2653><t2654>”</t2654>
<t2655>He stood up.</t2655> <t2656>His gaze was still shifting between Daisy and Gatsby.</t2656> <t2657>No one had moved from their place.</t2657>
<t2658>“What is wrong with you!” he almost succumbed to his anger for a moment, “What is your problem?</t2658> <t2659>If we are going to the city, let's get going.</t2659><t2660>”</t2660>
<t2661>With a trembling hand, caused by the effort to control his nerves, he brought the beer glass to his lips.</t2661> <t2662>Daisy's voice made all of us get up from our seats, and we stepped onto the sun-scorched gravel path.</t2662>
<t2663>“Are we leaving right away?” he objected, “Like this, I mean?</t2663> <t2664>Can't we even smoke a cigarette?</t2664><t2665>”</t2665>
<t2666>"Those who wanted to drink already did so during the meal."</t2666><t2667>"</t2667>
<t2668>“Come on, let’s have some fun,” Daisy pleaded, “It’s too hot to be cranky.</t2668><t2669>”</t2669>
<t2670>Her husband did not respond.</t2670>
<t2671>"As you wish," said Daisy, "come on, Jordan."</t2671>
<t2672>While we three men stood there, kicking the warm pebbles with the tips of our shoes, they went upstairs to get ready.</t2672> <t2673>Already, the silver crescent of the moon had become visible in the west.</t2673>
<t2674>Gatsby was about to say something but changed his mind and remained silent, yet Tom suddenly turned and saw him, becoming expectant.</t2674>
<t2675>"Do you have a stable here as well?" Gatsby asked, forcing himself.</t2675>
<t2676>“About five or six hundred meters ahead, a little down the road.</t2676><t2677>”</t2677>
<t2678>"How beautiful!"</t2678><t2679>"</t2679>
<t2680>Silence.</t2680>
<t2681>"Why are we going to the city, I don't know," Tom suddenly said angrily, "Women always come up with such strange ideas."</t2681>
<t2682>"Shall we get something to drink?" Daisy called out from the upstairs window.</t2682>
<t2683>“I’ll have a whiskey,” Tom replied and walked inside.</t2683>
<t2684>Gatsby suddenly turned and looked at me.</t2684>
<t2685>"I can't say anything while at that man's house, buddy.</t2685><t2686>"</t2686>
<t2687>“That Daisy is a blabbermouth,” I said hesitantly, “In her voice...</t2687><t2688>”</t2688>
<t2689>“There is a sound of money clinking in your voice,” he suddenly completed my sentence.</t2689>
<t2690>Yes, this was very true.</t2690> <t2691>I hadn't understood it before.</t2691> <t2692>There was the sound of money in her speech.</t2692> <t2693>The destructive allure that drew people in with its ups and downs came from this.</t2693> <t2694>From that jingle in her voice, that high-pitched melody reminiscent of a bell... She was a king's daughter living in an ivory palace.</t2694> <t2695>She was the golden girl!</t2695>
<t2696>Tom was leaving the house, wrapping the liter bottle in a towel, while Daisy and Jordan followed him with sparkling little hats on their heads and thin summer capes on their arms.</t2696>
<t2697>“Shall we all get into my car?” asked Gatsby, while touching the warmed, green leather seats.</t2697> <t2698>“I wish I had left it in the shade.</t2698><t2699>”</t2699>
<t2700>“Manual transmission?” said Tom.</t2700>
<t2701>“Yes.</t2701><t2702>”</t2702>
<t2703>"You take my sports car, and I'll take yours."</t2703><t2704></t2704>
<t2705>Gatsby was not very pleased with this suggestion.</t2705>
<t2706>“He might not have much gas,” he tried to argue.</t2706>
<t2707>"There's plenty of gas," said Tom, glancing at the gauge, "if it runs out, we'll get some from one of your pharmacies anyway.</t2707> <t2708>These days, everything is sold in pharmacies.</t2708><t2709>"</t2709>
<t2710>After this unnecessary information, there was a deep silence.</t2710> <t2711>Daisy frowned and looked at Tom.</t2711> <t2712>On Gatsby's face, there passed an indescribable expression that seemed both familiar and unrecognizable at the same time, as if I had only heard it described in words.</t2712>
<t2713>"Come on, Daisy," said Tom, pushing his wife towards Gatsby's car, "I'll take you in that circus wagon."</t2713>
<t2714>He had opened the car door and was waiting, but Daisy pulled back and freed herself from his arm.</t2714>
<t2715>"Take Nick and Jordan with you."</t2715> <t2716>"We'll follow behind in the small car."</t2716><t2717>”</t2717>
<t2718>He approached Gatsby and touched his jacket.</t2718> <t2719>Jordan, Tom, and I settled into the front seat of Gatsby's car.</t2719> <t2720>Tom engaged an unfamiliar gear and we sped into the oppressive heat, leaving them far behind and out of sight.</t2720>
<t2721>"You saw it, didn't you?" said Tom.</t2721>
<t2722>“What did we see?</t2722><t2723>”</t2723>
<t2724>He turned and looked at my face sternly.</t2724> <t2725>At that moment, he realized that Jordan and I knew the situation.</t2725>
<t2726>“Do you think I'm a fool?” he roared, “maybe I am a bit.</t2726> <t2727>But I have a sixth sense that guides me from time to time.</t2727> <t2728>You may not believe it, but science...</t2728><t2729>”</t2729>
<t2730>He fell silent.</t2730> <t2731>The possibility that came to his mind had pulled him out from the depths of the scientific assumptions he had approached.</t2731>
<t2732>"I did a little research on that sheriff," he continued, "If I had known the situation, I would have certainly deepened the research...</t2732><t2733>"</t2733>
<t2734>“So, you're saying I went to a psychic or something?” Jordan tried to make a joke out of it.</t2734>
<t2735>“What?” he asked while we were laughing, “A medium?</t2735><t2736>”</t2736>
<t2737>“For Gatsby, that is.</t2737><t2738>”</t2738>
<t2739>“For Gatsby?</t2739> <t2740>No, I didn't go.</t2740> <t2741>I just mean I did a little research on his past.</t2741><t2742>”</t2742>
<t2743>“I suppose you learned that he went to Oxford,” said the helpful Jordan.</t2743>
<t2744>“Did he study at Oxford?” He couldn't believe his ears, “No way!</t2744> <t2745>The man wears a pink suit!</t2745><t2746>”</t2746>
<t2747>“Still, he read it.</t2747><t2748>”</t2748>
<t2749>"That's the Oxford in New Mexico," Tom grumbled, "Or something like that.</t2749><t2750>"</t2750>
<t2751>"Alright, Tom.</t2751> <t2752>Why did you invite someone you look down on so much to dinner, then?" said Jordan, suddenly getting angry.</t2752>
<t2753>“Daisy called.</t2753> <t2754>She knew him before they got married.</t2754> <t2755>God knows from where!</t2755><t2756>”</t2756>
<t2757>As the effects of the beers diminished, we were becoming more irritable.</t2757> <t2758>Moreover, we were aware of this.</t2758> <t2759>We continued on our way for a while without speaking.</t2759> <t2760>Doctor T.</t2760> <t2761>J.</t2761> <t2762>When the pale eyes of Eckleburg suddenly appeared at the beginning of the road, I remembered Gatsby saying that his gas was running low.</t2762>
<t2763>“He will take you to the city,” said Tom.</t2763>
<t2764>"There is a repair shop over there," said Jordan, "I don't want to be stranded and roast in this heat.</t2764><t2765>"</t2765>
<t2766>When Tom impatiently pressed both brakes, the car skidded and stopped near the dusty pit right under the sign that read Wilson's Place.</t2766> <t2767>A minute later, the shop owner came out from inside and squinted at the car.</t2767>
<t2768>"Let's get some gas," Tom called out roughly, "Why do you think we stopped, for the scenery?</t2768><t2769>"</t2769>
<t2770>"I am very sick," said Wilson without moving, "I have been sick all day.</t2770><t2771>"</t2771>
<t2772>"What's wrong?"</t2772><t2773>"</t2773>
<t2774>"I am very exhausted."</t2774><t2775>"</t2775>
<t2776>“What, do you expect me to fill the tank myself?” asked Tom. “You didn't sound sick at all on the phone.</t2776><t2777>”</t2777>
<t2778>Wilson came from the shaded area at the doorway, struggling to breathe with great effort.</t2778> <t2779>As he opened the gas tank cap, I noticed that his face was completely green.</t2779>
<t2780>"I didn't want to call in the middle of your meal, but I really need money.</t2780> <t2781>That's why I was trying to find out what you were going to do with your old car.</t2781><t2782>"</t2782>
<t2783>“How did you find this?</t2783> <t2784>I just got it last week.</t2784><t2785>”</t2785>
<t2786>"Beautiful."</t2786> <t2787>"The fact that it's yellow is also nice," said the man, while trying to fill up the gas.</t2787>
<t2788>“Do you want to take it then?</t2788><t2789>”</t2789>
<t2790>“It would be nice,” he said, trying to smile, “but I don't want it.</t2790> <t2791>Maybe I can make a little profit from the other one.</t2791><t2792>”</t2792>
<t2793>“Why do you suddenly need money?”</t2793>
<t2794>“I have been here for a very long time.</t2794> <t2795>I want to go far away now.</t2795> <t2796>My wife and I both want to go West.</t2796><t2797>”</t2797>
<t2798>“Your wife?” Tom shouted in astonishment.</t2798>
<t2799>“He has been talking about this for ten years,” he said, shielding his eyes with his hand as he leaned against the gas pump, “now, whether he wants to or not, we will go.</t2799> <t2800>I will take him away from here.</t2800><t2801>”</t2801>
<t2802>Tom's sports car passed by us leaving a cloud of dust, and the people inside did not forget to wave.</t2802>
<t2803>“How much is my debt?” Tom asked in a harsh voice.</t2803>
<t2804>“I realized about two days ago that strange things were happening behind my back,” said the man, “That's why I want to get away from here.</t2804> <t2805>I wanted to know from him what you would do with your old car.</t2805><t2806>”</t2806>
<t2807>“How much do I owe you?</t2807><t2808>”</t2808>
<t2809>“One dollar, twenty cents.</t2809><t2810>”</t2810>
<t2811>The relentless heatwave must have clouded my mind.</t2811><t2812>Because while the man was talking, a constant fear gripped me until I realized he wasn't suspicious of Tom.</t2812><t2813>He had understood that Myrtle had a completely different life in a completely different world, and he had fallen ill from the shock of learning this.</t2813><t2814>I looked first at him, then at Tom, who had experienced a similar event about an hour earlier.</t2814><t2815>Suddenly, it occurred to me that apart from illness and health, there was no difference between men in terms of intelligence or race.</t2815><t2816>Wilson was so sick that he acted as if he had committed an unforgivable crime.</t2816><t2817>It was as if he had seduced a young girl and gotten her pregnant.</t2817>
<t2818>“I will give you the car,” said Tom, “I will send it tomorrow.”</t2818>
<t2819>The place we were in, even at noon, in daylight, was chilling and unsettling.</t2819> <t2820>Feeling as if there was something behind me, I turned and looked back.</t2820> <t2821>Doctor T.</t2821> <t2822>J.</t2822> <t2823>Eckleburg's eyes were, of course, always upon us.</t2823> <t2824>But it was certain that another pair of eyes a few meters away was also watching us closely.</t2824>
<t2825>The curtain of one of the windows on the upper floor of the garage was slightly parted.</t2825> <t2826>Myrtle Wilson was standing by the window, examining the car.</t2826> <t2827>She was so engrossed that she didn't even notice someone was watching her.</t2827> <t2828>Her face was taking on a series of changing expressions, passing through various phases like a developing photograph.</t2828> <t2829>These were not unfamiliar to me at all.</t2829> <t2830>It was an expression often seen on women's faces.</t2830> <t2831>While pondering what kind of explanation there could be, I suddenly realized that her eyes, radiating fear, horror, and jealousy, were fixed not on Tom but on Jordan, whom she mistook for his wife.</t2831>
<t2832>There is nothing as disturbing as a mind that is quite confused.</t2832> <t2833>When we set off again, Tom was writhing in the grip of worries, suffering as if he were being whipped.</t2833> <t2834>Within an hour, the two women in his grasp, both his wife and his mistress, had flown away at the same time.</t2834> <t2835>As his instincts told him to catch up with Daisy and get away from Wilson, he pressed the gas pedal harder.</t2835> <t2836>While driving towards Astoria at a speed of one hundred kilometers per hour, we first saw the spider-web-like girders of the railway bridge, and then the slow-moving blue sports car.</t2836>
<t2837>"50.</t2837> <t2838>Jordan threw out an idea, saying, "The movie theaters on the Avenue are very cool. I love the afternoons of summer days.</t2838> <t2839>Everyone has scattered somewhere, and New York becomes empty.</t2839> <t2840>This feels very erotic to me.</t2840> <t2841>I feel as if all kinds of ripe, fun fruits are about to fall into my hands.</t2841><t2842>"</t2842>
<t2843>The word 'Erotic' had completely unsettled Tom.</t2843> <t2844>Just as he was about to object, those in front of us stopped.</t2844>
<t2845>Daisy signaled us to pull over.</t2845>
<t2846>“Where are we going?” he shouted.</t2846>
<t2847>“What do you say to the movies?</t2847><t2848>”</t2848>
<t2849>“It's very hot,” he complained, “You go ahead, we'll drive around a bit, then meet you at a corner.” He forced himself to speak wittily, “We'll pull over to the side, for example, and I'll play the role of a man smoking two cigarettes at the same time.</t2849><t2850>”</t2850>
<t2851>"Let's not discuss these here," said Tom impatiently.</t2851> <t2852>The truck driver waiting behind us was honking as if he were swearing.</t2852>
<t2853>“Do not leave my side until we reach the south exit of Central Park, let's stop and talk in front of the Plaza.</t2853><t2854>”</t2854>
<t2855>While on the road, he looked back several times to check if they were coming.</t2855> <t2856>When they were delayed by traffic, he slowed down and waited.</t2856> <t2857>Perhaps he was afraid they would suddenly turn onto one of the side streets and disappear from his life.</t2857>
<t2858>But they didn't do it.</t2858> <t2859>And taking a step that is hard to explain, we decided to book a suite at the Plaza Hotel.</t2859>
<t2860>What remained in my mind from that long and stormy argument, which resulted in all of us being confined to a room, were some physical events such as my underwear wrapping around my legs like a wet snake and the sweat droplets slowly trickling down my back.</t2860> <t2861>In fact, Daisy initially suggested renting a room with five bathrooms and taking a cold shower, then the idea developed a bit more and became more reasonable, progressing towards finding a place to drink an 'Iced Mint Liqueur Cocktail.'</t2861> <t2862>We kept saying in unison that it was a 'crazy idea,' explaining something to the bewildered receptionist all at once, thinking we were in funny situations, or pretending to think so.</t2862>
<t2863>The room was spacious but stifling.</t2863> <t2864>Even though it was four o'clock, opening the windows hadn't helped; on the contrary, the heat rising from the trees in the park had filled the room.</t2864> <t2865>Daisy stood in front of the mirror and began to fix her hair.</t2865>
<t2866>“A magnificent suite,” said Jordan respectfully.</t2866> <t2867>Upon this, we all burst into laughter.</t2867>
<t2868>"Open another window," Daisy said without looking back.</t2868>
<t2869>"There is no other window."</t2869>
<t2870>“Then let's ask for an axe...</t2870><t2871>”</t2871>
<t2872>"The best thing is to get the heat out of our heads," said Tom, who was impatient again, "The more you talk like this, the worse it gets.</t2872><t2873>"</t2873>
<t2874>He unwrapped the whiskey from the towel and placed the bottle on the table.</t2874>
<t2875>“Why don't you leave the girl alone, buddy,” said Gatsby, “you were the one who wanted to come to the city.</t2875><t2876>”</t2876>
<t2877>Suddenly, silence fell over the room.</t2877> <t2878>At that moment, when the thick phone directory hanging on a nail on the wall came loose and fell, Jordan slowly said "Sorry" again.</t2878> <t2879>This time, no one laughed.</t2879>
<t2880>"I'll lift it," I said.</t2880>
<t2881>"I already bought it," said Gatsby.</t2881> <t2882>He examined the thinned rope, said "Hmm" with a knowledgeable attitude, and tossed the guide onto one of the chairs.</t2882>
<t2883>“I’ve heard this way of addressing most often from you!” said Tom in a harsh voice.</t2883>
<t2884>“Which one?</t2884><t2885>”</t2885>
<t2886>“That word 'buddy.'</t2886> <t2887>Where did it stick to your tongue from?</t2887><t2888>”</t2888>
<t2889>"Know this well, Tom," said Daisy, turning her back to the mirror, "if you're going to keep dealing with personal conflicts, I won't stay here for even a minute.</t2889> <t2890>Call reception and ask for some ice for the liquors.</t2890><t2891>"</t2891>
<t2892>Just as Tom was about to lift the receiver, the stifling heat was joined by voices.</t2892> <t2893>We all began to listen to the familiar melody of Mendelssohn's Wedding March rising from the ballroom downstairs.</t2893>
<t2894>"Imagine getting married in this heat," said Jordan with a sorrowful tone.</t2894>
<t2895>“I also… got married in mid-June,” Daisy remembered, “June in Louisville! Can you imagine?</t2895> <t2896>Someone had fainted.</t2896> <t2897>Who was it that fainted, Tom?</t2897><t2898>”</t2898>
<t2899>“Biloxi!” said Tom briefly.</t2899>
<t2900>“Yes, the man called Biloxi.</t2900> <t2901>‘blocker’ Biloxi.</t2901> <t2902>He was a box manufacturer –that’s absolutely true- and he was from the village of Biloxi in Tennessee.</t2902><t2903>”</t2903>
<t2904>“They had moved him to our house,” Jordan added, “the house was very close to the church.</t2904> <t2905>There were only two buildings in between.</t2905> <t2906>The man stayed with us for three weeks.</t2906> <t2907>In the end, my father had to tell him that he needed to leave.</t2907> <t2908>One day after he left, my father died.”</t2908> <t2909>He paused for a moment.</t2909> <t2910>“There was no connection, of course.</t2910><t2911>”</t2911>
<t2912>"I also know someone named Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I said.</t2912>
<t2913>“He must be our cousin from Biloxi.</t2913> <t2914>Before the man left, I had learned his entire family's life story.</t2914> <t2915>I still use the aluminum golf club he gave me back then.</t2915><t2916>” said Jordan.</t2916>
<t2917>When the wedding ceremony began, the music downstairs stopped.</t2917> <t2918>A little later, long-lasting applause sounds filled the room through the window.</t2918> <t2919>Occasionally.</t2919> <t2920>'Yes.</t2920> <t2921>Yeees!' shouts were heard, and suddenly a jazz song bursting out was also a sign that the dance was about to begin.</t2921>
<t2922>“We're getting old,” said Daisy.</t2922> <t2923>“If we were young, we would immediately get up and dance.</t2923><t2924>”</t2924>
<t2925>"Think about Biloxi!" Jordan warned.</t2925> <t2926>"How did you know him, Tom?</t2926><t2927>"</t2927>
<t2928>“Biloxi?” he was trying to remember, “I didn't know him.</t2928> <t2929>He was a friend of Daisy's.</t2929><t2930>”</t2930>
<t2931>“No, it wasn't,” Daisy objected.</t2931> <t2932>“I saw him there for the first time.</t2932> <t2933>He had already come in his own car.</t2933><t2934>”</t2934>
<t2935>"Anyway.</t2935> <t2936>The man said he knew you.</t2936> <t2937>He grew up in Louisville.</t2937> <t2938>Asa Bird brought him at the last minute and asked if we had any extra space.</t2938><t2939>"</t2939>
<t2940>“He was probably someone trying to hitchhike home.</t2940> <t2941>He told me he was your class representative at Yale,” said Jordan with a smile.</t2941>
<t2942>Tom and I exchanged bewildered glances.</t2942>
<t2943>“Biloxi?</t2943><t2944>”</t2944>
<t2945>“But we don't have a class representative...</t2945><t2946>”</t2946>
<t2947>Upon Gatsby impatiently starting to tap his foot, Tom suddenly turned to him.</t2947> <t2948>"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I heard you went to Oxford," he said.</t2948>
<t2949>“Not exactly like that.</t2949><t2950>”</t2950>
<t2951>“Still, you went to Oxford.</t2951><t2952>”</t2952>
<t2953>“Yes, that's true.</t2953><t2954>”</t2954>
<t2955>Silence.</t2955> <t2956>Then Tom, with a voice full of doubt and disdain, said, "I suppose you were at Oxford while Biloxi was at Yale."</t2956>
<t2957>Again, silence.</t2957> <t2958>The waiter who came for room service entered with mint liqueur, soda, and crushed ice in hand.</t2958> <t2959>But neither his saying 'thank you' nor his slowly closing the door behind him as he left broke the silence.</t2959> <t2960>This tremendous detail finally needed to be clarified.</t2960> <t2961>"I told you I went there," said Gatsby.</t2961>
<t2962>“I heard you.</t2962> <t2963>I want to know the time.</t2963><t2964>”</t2964>
<t2965>"In 1919."</t2965> <t2966>"I stayed there for only five months."</t2966> <t2967>"Therefore, I do not consider myself a true Oxfordian."</t2967>
<t2968>Tom looked around to see if he could spot himself.</t2968> <t2969>We, on the other hand, were looking at Gatsby.</t2969>
<t2970>"After the ceasefire, some officers were granted such a right," he continued, "we could go to any university in England or France if we wanted."</t2970><t2971>"</t2971>
<t2972>I was struggling to resist the urge to stand up and give him a friendly slap on the shoulder.</t2972> <t2973>What had happened before had happened again, and my trust in Gatsby was renewed.</t2973>
<t2974>Daisy stood up and walked towards the table with a slight smile on her lips.</t2974>
<t2975>"Open the whiskey, Tom," he ordered, "I'll prepare the mint cocktail.</t2975> <t2976>Then maybe you won't feel so stupid!</t2976> <t2977>How much liqueur should I put?</t2977><t2978>"</t2978>
<t2979>"Wait a minute," Tom snapped.</t2979> <t2980>"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question."</t2980> <t2981>"Go ahead," Gatsby said politely.</t2981>
<t2982>“What kind of trouble are you trying to stir up in my home, tell me!</t2982><t2983>”</t2983>
<t2984>Finally, everything had come to light, and Gatsby was pleased with it.</t2984>
<t2985>“She isn't causing any trouble,” said Daisy, looking desperately from one to the other, “You are the one causing it.</t2985> <t2986>Please control yourself a bit.</t2986><t2987>”</t2987>
<t2988>“Saying I should control myself!” repeated Tom, foaming with rage, “What, while Mr. Nobody is flirting with my wife, I should just sit and allow it?</t2988> <t2989>If that's what you think, don't include me in this game...</t2989> <t2990>These days, people have started to thoroughly despise the institution of marriage and family life.</t2990> <t2991>Soon they will push everything aside, even blacks and whites will marry.</t2991><t2992>”</t2992>
<t2993>He had declared himself the unyielding last bastion of civilization, flushed red with the fervor of the nonsense he defended.</t2993>
<t2994>"We're all white anyway," Jordan muttered.</t2994>
<t2995>“I know I'm not very popular.</t2995> <t2996>Maybe I don't throw big parties.</t2996> <t2997>If you want to find a place for yourself in the modern world, it seems you need to turn your home into a mess.</t2997><t2998>”</t2998>
<t2999>Despite being filled with anger - we were all in the same situation - I struggled to keep myself from laughing whenever Tom opened his mouth.</t2999> <t3000>He was about to complete the transition from being a libertine to being conservative.</t3000>
<t3001>“I have things to say to you too, buddy,” Gatsby began.</t3001> <t3002>Daisy understood his intention.</t3002> <t3003>In desperation, she interrupted, saying, “Please don't.”</t3003>
<t3004>“Please, let's go home now.</t3004> <t3005>Why don't we disperse to our homes immediately?</t3005><t3006>”</t3006>
<t3007>“Good idea,” I said, standing up.</t3007>
<t3008>"Come on, Tom, nobody wants a drink anyway."</t3008><t3009></t3009>
<t3010>“Mr. Gatsby, I wondered what you would say.</t3010><t3011>”</t3011>
<t3012>"Your wife doesn't love you.</t3012> <t3013>She never did, the person she loves is me.</t3013><t3014>"</t3014>
<t3015>"You've gone mad!" Tom suddenly shouted.</t3015>
<t3016>Gatsby, trembling with excitement, had jumped to his feet.</t3016>
<t3017>“She never loved you, do you hear me?” he shouted, “I was penniless and she was tired of waiting.</t3017> <t3018>That's why she married you.</t3018> <t3019>It was a terrible mistake.</t3019> <t3020>She never loved anyone but me.</t3020><t3021>”</t3021>
<t3022>At that moment, Jordan and I got up to leave.</t3022> <t3023>But both Tom and Gatsby insisted that we stay, as if they were competing with each other.</t3023> <t3024>Both of them acted as if they had nothing to hide, as if it were a privilege to watch them reveal their feelings and share in their excitement.</t3024>
<t3025>"Sit down, Daisy," said Tom.</t3025> <t3026>He was trying to give his voice an authoritative tone but wasn't very successful.</t3026>
<t3027>“What is happening?</t3027> <t3028>I want to know everything.</t3028><t3029>”</t3029>
<t3030>“I told you what happened,” said Gatsby, “I’m talking about something that spans five years and many things you don’t know about.</t3030><t3031>”</t3031>
<t3032>Tom suddenly turned to Daisy.</t3032>
<t3033>“Have you been seeing this guy for five years?</t3033><t3034>”</t3034>
<t3035>“No, we weren't meeting,” said Gatsby, “We couldn't meet.</t3035> <t3036>But we loved each other, buddy, and you didn't know that.</t3036> <t3037>Sometimes I would think and laugh,” his eyes weren't smiling as he spoke, “it would seem funny to me that you didn't know.</t3037><t3038>”</t3038>
<t3039>“So that's how it is,” said Tom, leaning back and touching his large fingertips together with a priestly air.</t3039>
<t3040>“You’re crazy!” he burst out, “I can’t say anything about what happened five years ago because I didn’t know Daisy then.</t3040> <t3041>Besides, I can’t fathom how you could have gotten within a mile of her during that time – unless, of course, you were the one delivering the grocery orders through the back door.</t3041> <t3042>The rest is all a big lie.</t3042> <t3043>Daisy married me because she loved me and she still does.</t3043><t3044>”</t3044>
<t3045>"No," said Gatsby, shaking his head from side to side.</t3045>
<t3046>“Yes, he loves.</t3046> <t3047>Sometimes his mind gets stuck on silly things and he doesn't know what to do.</t3047> <t3048>That's all.” Then he added with great seriousness, “of course, I love him too.</t3048> <t3049>Sometimes I stray and do foolish things, but I have always returned to him.</t3049> <t3050>The love I feel in the depths of my heart has never diminished.</t3050><t3051>”</t3051>
<t3052>"You are disgusting," said Daisy, then she turned to me and her voice, laden with reproach and dropping an octave in anger, resonated in the room.</t3052>
<t3053>"Do you know why we left Chicago?</t3053> <t3054>I wonder how they didn't involve you in that little 'going astray' story.</t3054><t3055>"</t3055>
<t3056>Gatsby got up from his seat and took a few steps toward her.</t3056>
<t3057>“It's over now, Daisy,” he said sincerely, “it doesn't matter at all.</t3057> <t3058>Tell him the truth.</t3058> <t3059>Explain that you never loved him.</t3059> <t3060>Let everything be clarified forever.</t3060><t3061>”</t3061>
<t3062>Daisy looked at him with unseeing eyes.</t3062>
<t3063>“How can I love him?</t3063> <t3064>How is this possible?” she said.</t3064>
<t3065>“You never loved him.</t3065><t3066>”</t3066>
<t3067>Daisy was in hesitation.</t3067> <t3068>She looked at me and then at Jordan as if asking for help.</t3068> <t3069>It was as if she was just realizing what she had done.</t3069> <t3070>And as if she hadn't really wanted to do them.</t3070> <t3071>But what was done was done.</t3071> <t3072>It was too late now.</t3072>
<t3073>“I never liked him,” the words slipped out of her mouth unintentionally.</t3073>
<t3074>"Even when you were in Kapiolani?" he asked.</t3074>
<t3075>“No.</t3075><t3076>”</t3076>
<t3077>The suffocating sounds rising from the ballroom below continued to reach us over the waves of hot air.</t3077>
<t3078>“Well, what about that day when I carried you in my arms so your shoes wouldn't get wet in the rain?” the voice was soft and affectionate, “Huh, Daisy?</t3078><t3079>”</t3079>
<t3080>"Please don't," Daisy's voice was icy, but her resentment seemed slightly diminished.</t3080> <t3081>She looked at Gatsby, "I did it, Jay," she said.</t3081> <t3082>Her hand, trying to light a cigarette, was trembling.</t3082> <t3083>Suddenly, she threw both the cigarette and the lit match onto the carpet.</t3083>
<t3084>“But you want too much!” he shouted, “I love you, isn't that enough?</t3084> <t3085>I can't erase the past!</t3085><t3086>”</t3086>
<t3087>She had started crying.</t3087>
<t3088>“Once upon a time, I loved him.</t3088> <t3089>But I loved you too.</t3089><t3090>”</t3090>
<t3091>Gatsby blinked his eyes.</t3091>
<t3092>“So, you loved me too,” he repeated.</t3092>
<t3093>“That's a lie,” said Tom bitterly, “He wasn't even aware that you existed.</t3093> <t3094>There are things between my wife and me that you couldn't understand even one of them.</t3094> <t3095>Things that neither of us will ever forget.</t3095><t3096>”</t3096>
<t3097>It was as if the words were wounding Gatsby's body.</t3097>
<t3098>"I want to talk to Daisy alone," he insisted, "she is very worried right now...</t3098><t3099>"</t3099>
<t3100>“Even if we are alone, I can't say that I never loved Tom,” said Daisy.</t3100> <t3101>Her voice was full of pain.</t3101>
<t3102>"This can't be real.</t3102><t3103>"</t3103>
<t3104>"Of course not," Tom agreed.</t3104>
<t3105>"As if he cares about any of this," said Daisy, turning to her husband.</t3105>
<t3106>"Of course I care.</t3106> <t3107>From now on, I will take much better care of you.</t3107><t3108>"</t3108>
<t3109>"I guess you didn't understand," Gatsby's voice had a slight hint of panic, "you won't be taking care of her anymore.</t3109><t3110>"</t3110>
<t3111>“Is that so?” said Tom.</t3111> <t3112>He opened his eyes wide and laughed, "Why is that?</t3112><t3113>"</t3113>
<t3114>“He is leaving you.</t3114><t3115>”</t3115>
<t3116>“Nonsense.</t3116><t3117>”</t3117>
<t3118>“Yes, it is,” said Daisy, making a visible effort.</t3118>
<t3119>“She won't leave me.” Tom's words were disheartening Gatsby, “She would never do that for a lowly swindler like you who even had to steal the wedding ring you put on her finger.</t3119><t3120>”</t3120>
<t3121>“I can't stand it,” cried Daisy, “Please, let's get out of here already!</t3121><t3122>”</t3122>
<t3123>“Who do you think you are!” Tom was shouting, “you’re just one of those people hanging around Meyer Wolfsheim.”</t3123> <t3124>“That’s all I know for now.”</t3124> <t3125>“I’ve done a little investigation on you.”</t3125> <t3126>“Tomorrow I’ll learn more.”</t3126><t3127>”</t3127>
<t3128>"As you wish, buddy," said Gatsby without hesitation.</t3128>
<t3129>"I also know what's going on in your pharmacies."</t3129> <t3130>Then he turned to us.</t3130> <t3131>"These two have opened a bunch of stores on the streets of New York and Chicago and sold tons of grain alcohol on the market.</t3131> <t3132>That's just one of their tricks.</t3132> <t3133>I suspected he was a bootlegger the moment I saw him.</t3133> <t3134>I wasn't wrong.</t3134><t3135>"</t3135>
<t3136>“So what if it is? said Gatsby without breaking his politeness. “Your friend Walter Chase got involved in that too but later regretted it.</t3136><t3137>”</t3137>
<t3138>“As soon as he fell into a difficult situation, you abandoned him.</t3138> <t3139>You didn't say a word about him spending a month in a New Jersey prison.</t3139> <t3140>My God! If only you could hear what Walter says about you.</t3140><t3141>”</t3141>
<t3142>“The man approached us when he was penniless.</t3142> <t3143>He quite enjoyed earning some money, my friend.</t3143><t3144>”</t3144>
<t3145>"Stop calling me 'buddy'," Tom shouted.</t3145>
<t3146>Gatsby didn't say anything.</t3146>
<t3147>“Walter was going to get into trouble for running bets, but Wolfsheim threatened him to keep his mouth shut.</t3147><t3148>”</t3148>
<t3149>That unusual but familiar expression had appeared on Gatsby's face again.</t3149>
<t3150>“Actually, that pharmacy business was just a drop in the ocean,” Tom continued, “now, whatever kind of business you're after, Wolfsheim even avoided telling me.</t3150><t3151>”</t3151>
<t3152>I looked at Daisy.</t3152> <t3153>She was looking at Gatsby and then at her husband with eyes full of terror.</t3153> <t3154>Jordan, on the other hand, was focusing all her attention on balancing an imaginary object on her chin.</t3154> <t3155>When I turned my gaze back to Gatsby, I was stunned by the expression I saw on his face.</t3155> <t3156>Let me use the phrase that a gossiping guest at one of the parties used; 'he looked like he had killed someone.'</t3156> <t3157>For a moment, what I saw on his face could only be described in such a fantastical way.</t3157>
<t3158>His face changed.</t3158> <t3159>He started talking to Daisy excitedly.</t3159> <t3160>He was denying everything, making great efforts to clear himself even on matters he wasn't accused of.</t3160> <t3161>But with every word that came out of his mouth, Daisy retreated further into herself.</t3161> <t3162>And finally, he gave up.</t3162> <t3163>All that was left was the struggle of a dead dream, desperately and hopelessly trying to touch what had already slipped away with the passing time, towards the lost voice at the other end of the room.</t3163>
<t3164>The voice pleaded once more to leave.</t3164>
<t3165>“Please Tom! I can't take it anymore,” she said</t3165>
<t3166>Daisy's eyes filled with horror told that everything she wanted to do and all her courage had flown away never to return.</t3166>
<t3167>"You two get into Mr. Gatsby's car again," said Tom.</t3167>
<t3168>The woman looked at him in panic, but her husband insisted disdainfully.</t3168>
<t3169>“Go on, leave.</t3169> <t3170>He won't bother you anymore.</t3170> <t3171>I think he has realized that the period of his inappropriate flirting is over.</t3171><t3172>”</t3172>
<t3173>Both of them left like ghosts, without saying a single word, shattered, randomly pieced together, and deprived even of our mercy.</t3173>
<t3174>After they left, Tom stood up and, while wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle he had brought with him back in the towel, asked us, "Would you like some of this, Nick? Jordan?"</t3174>
<t3175>I did not respond.</t3175>
<t3176>“Nick?” she said again.</t3176>
<t3177>“What?</t3177><t3178>”</t3178>
<t3179>"Do you want it?</t3179><t3180>"</t3180>
<t3181>“No.</t3181> <t3182>You know, I just remembered that today is my birthday.</t3182><t3183>”</t3183>
<t3184>I had turned thirty.</t3184> <t3185>A brand new period full of danger and adventure lay ahead of me.</t3185>
<t3186>It was seven o'clock when we got into Tom's sports car and set off towards Long Island.</t3186> <t3187>He kept talking, telling stories and laughing, but in reality, he was as distant from us as the hum of pedestrians on the sidewalk and the noise of trains passing over the railway above us.</t3187> <t3188>There are limits to human tolerance.</t3188> <t3189>Both Jordan and I had left their pathetic arguments behind us along with the city lights.</t3189> <t3190>The thirties!</t3190> <t3191>A decade that brings nothing but loneliness, where the number of single men you know, your desire to work, and your hair all steadily decrease...</t3191> <t3192>But beside me was Jordan, a girl smart enough not to carry her lost dreams within her for years like Daisy.</t3192> <t3193>As we crossed an unlit bridge, she gently rested her head on my shoulder.</t3193> <t3194>All the turmoil and fears of being thirty vanished the moment she squeezed my hand with hers that lay in my palm.</t3194>
<t3195>In the twilight of the evening that was starting to cool, we were rapidly heading towards death.</t3195>
<t3196>The Greek young man Michaelis, who ran the coffee shop next to the piles of ash, was the most important witness heard during the investigation.</t3196> <t3197>He had spent that hot day sleeping until five o'clock, then went to the repair shop and saw that George Wilson was very sick.</t3197> <t3198>The poor man was in terrible condition.</t3198> <t3199>His face was as yellow as his hair and he was trembling all over.</t3199> <t3200>Michaelis suggested that he go upstairs and lie down, but Wilson refused.</t3200> <t3201>He said he would lose money because he couldn't attend to the comings and goings.</t3201> <t3202>While Michaelis was trying to persuade him, a terrible noise was heard from upstairs.</t3202>
<t3203>“I locked my wife in the room!” Wilson explained in a calm voice, “she will stay there until the next day.</t3203> <t3204>Then we will leave this place.</t3204><t3205>”</t3205>
<t3206>Michaelis was astonished.</t3206> <t3207>He thought that a neighbor of four years wouldn't even be capable of saying, let alone doing, such a thing.</t3207> <t3208>Because he was one of those weary men who would sit on the chair in front of the door and watch people pass by when he wasn't working.</t3208> <t3209>Whenever something was said, he would always respond with his soulless and calm smile.</t3209> <t3210>It wasn't him who was dominant at home, but his wife.</t3210>
<t3211>Michaelis naturally tried to find out what had happened between them.</t3211><t3212>But he couldn't get a single word out of him.</t3212><t3213>On the contrary, Wilson looked at him with curiosity and suspicion and started asking strange questions.</t3213><t3214>He kept asking where he was and what he was doing at certain days and times.</t3214><t3215>Although he was tired of this suspicious interrogation, Michaelis, trying not to succumb to his anger, said he would be back soon and escaped when he saw a few workers heading towards a diner.</t3215><t3216>He never returned.</t3216><t3217>He probably forgot all about it.</t3217><t3218>But when he stepped out in front of his shop around seven in the evening, he remembered the conversation he had with Wilson.</t3218><t3219>Because he heard Mrs. Wilson, who had gone mad with rage, severely scolding her husband.</t3219>
<t3220>“Come on, hit me,” the woman was shouting, “Drag me on the ground.</t3220> <t3221>Come on, hit me, let's see.</t3221> <t3222>You cowardly man!</t3222><t3223>”</t3223>
<t3224>One minute later, the woman ran outside, wildly waving her arms and shouting.</t3224> <t3225>By the time the man ran from his shop and reached her, everything had already happened.</t3225> <t3226>The car, referred to as the ‘death vehicle’ in the newspapers, continued on its way without slowing down after the incident.</t3226> <t3227>A few meters later, it seemed to hesitate, not knowing what to do.</t3227> <t3228>Then it turned onto a nearby road, blending into the encroaching darkness and disappearing from sight.</t3228> <t3229>Michaelis couldn’t quite make out the color of the car.</t3229> <t3230>In his initial statement to the police, he said it was light green.</t3230> <t3231>The other car heading towards New York had stopped a few meters away.</t3231> <t3232>Its driver ran towards Myrtle Wilson, who had met a brutal end in the middle of the road, her dark blood mingling with the dust.</t3232>
<t3233>The first to reach the woman were Michaelis and that man.</t3233> <t3234>When they tore Myrtle's blouse, still wet with sweat, they saw her left breast torn and flapping like a wing.</t3234> <t3235>There was no need to listen to see if her heart was beating.</t3235> <t3236>The corners of her open mouth were torn, as if struggling to stop the great energy she had carried in her body for years from escaping.</t3236>
<t3237>As we approached the scene, we immediately noticed three or four cars parked on the side of the road and the gathered crowd.</t3237>
<t3238>“There is rubble,” said Tom, “at least Wilson has some work to do.</t3238><t3239>”</t3239>
<t3240>We had slowed down, but Tom had no intention of stopping until he noticed the silence and the expressions on the faces of those standing at the door of the repair shop.</t3240> <t3241>As soon as he saw the situation, he hit the brakes.</t3241>
<t3242>"Let's go and see," he said, pausing a little, "we'll be right back.</t3242><t3243>"</t3243>
<t3244>I could hear a sound similar to crying echoing in the workshop.</t3244> <t3245>As I got out of the car and walked towards the door, the incessant moans turned into the repeatedly uttered words "Oh my God!"</t3245>
<t3246>"Bad things have happened here!" said Tom excitedly.</t3246>
<t3247>He looked at the workshop illuminated by the yellow light inside a hanging wire basket, rising on his tiptoes over the circle of human heads.</t3247> <t3248>He let out a painful sound from the depths of his chest and pushed the crowd aside with his strong arms, diving inside.</t3248>
<t3249>After he passed, it took me some time to see anything because people had resumed their old places with murmurs full of criticism.</t3249> <t3250>However, as the surroundings became more lively with the newcomers, Jordan and I found ourselves pushed inside.</t3250>
<t3251>Myrtie Wilson's body, wrapped in two blankets as if she were cold despite the warm night, was lying on the large counter against the wall, and Tom, who had his back to us, was leaning over her, standing still.</t3251> <t3252>The motorcycle policeman next to him was taking notes in his notebook, sweating profusely and making a great effort to correct his mistakes.</t3252> <t3253>When I first entered, I couldn't find the source of the wailing that echoed in the empty, bare repair shop.</t3253> <t3254>Then I saw Wilson, swaying back and forth, holding onto either side of the door at the high threshold of the place used as an office.</t3254> <t3255>Next to him stood a man trying to console him, occasionally placing his hand on Wilson's shoulder.</t3255> <t3256>Wilson neither saw nor heard him.</t3256> <t3257>He would shift his gaze from the lamp above to the table against the wall, then suddenly look back at the lamp again, his terrible moaning echoing through the place.</t3257> <t3258>He kept saying, 'Oh.</t3258> <t3259>God! Oh my God! Oh God! God!’</t3259>
<t3260>At one point, Tom lifted his head and cast his vacant gaze around.</t3260> <t3261>Then he turned to the police and mumbled something.</t3261>
<t3262>“M-a-v,” said the policeman.</t3262> <t3263>“h…</t3263><t3264>”</t3264>
<t3265>"No, there's an 'r' in between," someone corrected, "M-a-v-r-o-"</t3265>
<t3266>"Listen to me," said Tom angrily.</t3266>
<t3267>“-r” said the police, “o”</t3267>
<t3268>“</t3268><t3269>g”</t3269>
<t3270>“G” he said as Tom's big hand landed on his shoulder.</t3270>
<t3271>“What do you want, sir?</t3271><t3272>”</t3272>
<t3273>"What happened?</t3273> <t3274>I want to know that.</t3274><t3275>"</t3275>
<t3276>“A car hit him.</t3276> <t3277>He died instantly.</t3277><t3278>”</t3278>
<t3279>“He died instantly,” said Tom, looking at the table.</t3279>
<t3280>“The woman suddenly jumped onto the road.</t3280> <t3281>The one who hit…</t3281> <t3282>pulled the child and left without stopping.</t3282><t3283>”</t3283>
<t3284>“There were two cars,” said Michaelis, “One was coming and the other was going, do you understand?</t3284><t3285>”</t3285>
<t3286>“Where were they going?” said the police with interest.</t3286>
<t3287>“They were going in separate directions.</t3287> <t3288>The woman…” she was about to point to the pile of blankets but changed her mind, “darted out of the garage and the car coming from the direction of New York hit her.</t3288> <t3289>It was going at fifty or sixty.</t3289><t3290>”</t3290>
<t3291>"What is this place called?" asked the Police.</t3291>
<t3292>"It has no name"</t3292>
<t3293>A pale-skinned, well-dressed black man approached them.</t3293>
<t3294>“It was a yellow car,” he said.</t3294> <t3295>“A huge yellow car.</t3295> <t3296>Brand new.</t3296><t3297>”</t3297>
<t3298>"Did you see the accident?" asked the police.</t3298>
<t3299>“No, but it sped past me down the road.</t3299> <t3300>It wasn't fifty or sixty, it was seventy or eighty kilometers per hour.</t3300><t3301>”</t3301>
<t3302>"Come this way, let me take your name.</t3302> <t3303>Be careful.</t3303> <t3304>I'm trying to learn the man's name.</t3304><t3305>"</t3305>
<t3306>Some of the words spoken in this conversation must have reached Wilson's ears, who was hanging around the office door.</t3306> <t3307>He stopped his lament.</t3307>
<t3308>"You don't need to tell me what kind of car it is.</t3308> <t3309>I know it!" he shouted.</t3309>
<t3310>I looked at Tom, it was evident that his back muscles were tensed under his jacket.</t3310> <t3311>He went over to Wilson and grabbed the man tightly by his upper arms.</t3311>
<t3312>"You need to pull yourself together!" he said, his voice both stern and soothing.</t3312>
<t3313>Wilson lifted his head and tried to rise on his tiptoes.</t3313> <t3314>If Tom hadn't held him, his knees would have buckled, and he would have fallen.</t3314>
<t3315>“Listen to me!” said Tom, shaking her, “I just came from New York.</t3315> <t3316>I was bringing you the sports car I promised.</t3316> <t3317>The yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine.</t3317> <t3318>Do you understand?</t3318> <t3319>I haven't seen it for hours.</t3319><t3320>”</t3320>
<t3321>Only I and that well-dressed black man had heard what he said.</t3321> <t3322>But the police must have discovered something suspicious in Tom's tone of voice, as they turned their stern gaze towards us.</t3322>
<t3323>“What is happening there?” he asked.</t3323>
<t3324>Tom turned his head but did not take his hands off Wilson's body.</t3324>
<t3325>“I am a close friend of this man.</t3325> <t3326>He says he saw the car that caused the accident...</t3326> <t3327>it was a yellow car.</t3327><t3328>”</t3328>
<t3329>The police looked at Tom with suspicion, driven by an impulse that was hard to understand.</t3329>
<t3330>"What color is your car?" he asked.</t3330>
<t3331>“Blue, blue sport.</t3331><t3332>”</t3332>
<t3333>"We just arrived from New York," I said.</t3333> <t3334>Upon one of the cars behind us on the road confirming this, the police moved away from us.</t3334>
<t3335>“Now, say your name properly so we can write it down,” he said, turning to the black man.</t3335>
<t3336>Tom, who lifted Wilson like a baby and carried him into the office, sat him down on a chair and came over to us.</t3336>
<t3337>“Someone come here and sit next to the poor man,” he said in an authoritative voice.</t3337> <t3338>The two men closest to each other looked at each other's faces and reluctantly headed inside.</t3338> <t3339>Our guy didn't take his eyes off them until they entered through the door.</t3339> <t3340>Then he closed the door in between and came to us in one swift move, trying not to look at the table.</t3340>
<t3341>"Let's get out of here," he whispered as he passed by me.</t3341>
<t3342>As he made his way through the ever-growing crowd with his strong arms, clearing a path ahead of us, he quickly entered with his bag in hand, passing by the doctor who had been summoned in a desperate attempt half an hour earlier.</t3342>
<t3343>We went slowly until we reached the upcoming bend.</t3343> <t3344>Then Tom suddenly stepped on the gas and the car shot forward like an arrow through the darkness.</t3344>
<t3345>When I heard the sobs she was trying to suppress, I saw tears streaming down her cheeks.</t3345>
<t3346>“Damn coward!” he muttered angrily, “He didn't even stop to look.</t3346><t3347>”</t3347>
<t3348>The Buchanan's mansion suddenly appeared through the dark tree trunks.</t3348> <t3349>Tom stood on the terrace and looked up.</t3349> <t3350>Light streaming from two windows on the second floor filtered through the ivy.</t3350>
<t3351>“Daisy has come,” said Tom while trying to get out of the car.</t3351> <t3352>Then, looking at my face and frowning slightly, “I wish I had dropped you off at West Egg, Nick.</t3352> <t3353>There’s nothing we can do here tonight anyway.</t3353><t3354>”</t3354>
<t3355>His behavior was different from usual.</t3355> <t3356>His voice was more serious than usual, and his speech was more determined.</t3356> <t3357>As he approached the door, crushing the pebbles that shone in the moonlight, he intervened in the situation with a few short sentences.</t3357>
<t3358>"Let me find a taxi to take you home.</t3358> <t3359>While you wait, you and Jordan can go to the kitchen and have something prepared to snack on.</t3359> <t3360>If you want, of course," he said, opening the door.</t3360>
<t3361>"Come in.</t3361><t3362>"</t3362>
<t3363>“Thank you, I won't come in.</t3363> <t3364>But I would appreciate it if you could call a taxi.</t3364> <t3365>I'll wait outside.</t3365><t3366>”</t3366>
<t3367>"Won't you come in, Nick?" said Jordan as she placed her hand on my arm.</t3367>
<t3368>“No, thank you!”</t3368><t3369>”</t3369>
<t3370>I was feeling a bit sick and wanted to be alone.</t3370> <t3371>But Jordan lingered by my side a little longer.</t3371>
<t3372>“It's only half past nine,” he said.</t3372>
<t3373>I absolutely did not want to go inside.</t3373> <t3374>What I had experienced was too much for one day.</t3374> <t3375>I was fed up with all of them, including Jordan.</t3375> <t3376>He must have finally understood, as he turned around, ran up the stairs, and went into the house.</t3376> <t3377>I sat on the steps with my head in my hands until I heard the servant inside pick up the receiver and call a taxi.</t3377> <t3378>Then I got up and walked slowly away from the house along the gravel path.</t3378> <t3379>My intention was to wait for the taxi in front of the garden gate.</t3379>
<t3380>I had taken a few steps when I heard my name being called and saw Gatsby emerging from the bushes at the side of the road.</t3380> <t3381>My mind must have been quite confused because I stood there doing nothing but thinking how beautifully his pink suit shone in the moonlight.</t3381>
<t3382>"What are you doing?" I asked.</t3382>
<t3383>“I'm just passing the time, buddy”</t3383>
<t3384>For some reason, this seemed like a despicable endeavor to me.</t3384> <t3385>He might attempt to rob the house soon.</t3385> <t3386>I wouldn't be surprised to see Wolfsheim's men or other sinister faces emerging from those dark bushes.</t3386>
<t3387>"Did you see anything bad on the way here?" he asked a minute later.</t3387>
<t3388>"Yes"</t3388>
<t3389>He hesitated.</t3389>
<t3390>“So, is he dead?” he asked.</t3390>
<t3391>“Yes.</t3391><t3392>”</t3392>
<t3393>“I understood.</t3393> <t3394>I even told Daisy.</t3394> <t3395>I thought it was appropriate for her to learn immediately.</t3395> <t3396>She held up quite well, all things considered.</t3396><t3397>”</t3397>
<t3398>It was as if he was talking as though only Daisy's reaction mattered.</t3398>
<t3399>“Eve, I came from the less-used side road.</t3399> <t3400>I put the car in the garage,” he continued.</t3400> <t3401>“I don't think anyone saw me, but I'm not entirely sure.</t3401><t3402>”</t3402>
<t3403>I hated him so much that I didn't even bother to tell him he was wrong.</t3403>
<t3404>“Who is that woman?” he asked.</t3404>
<t3405>“Her name is Wilson.</t3405> <t3406>She is the wife of the owner of the repair shop.</t3406> <t3407>How the damn accident happened.</t3407><t3408>”</t3408>
<t3409>“Actually, I tried to turn the steering wheel, but...</t3409><t3410>”</t3410>
<t3411>When I suddenly stopped, I understood the truth.</t3411>
<t3412>“Was Daisy the one driving the car?</t3412><t3413>”</t3413>
<t3414>“Yes,” he said and paused for a moment, then, “But of course, I'll say I was driving.</t3414> <t3415>He was very angry when we left New York.</t3415> <t3416>He thought he would calm down a bit if he took the wheel.</t3416> <t3417>As we were passing by the car coming from the opposite direction, that woman jumped in front of us.</t3417> <t3418>Everything happened in an instant.</t3418> <t3419>For some reason, it seemed to me that the woman wanted to talk to us.</t3419> <t3420>I guess she thought there was someone she knew in the car.</t3420> <t3421>Daisy first swerved the wheel towards the car passing by us, then panicked and turned it the other way.</t3421> <t3422>The moment I reached for the wheel, I felt the impact.</t3422> <t3423>She must have died immediately.</t3423><t3424>”</t3424>
<t3425>"His chest is shattered,"</t3425>
<t3426>“It would be better if you don't tell, buddy,” he said, shuddering, “anyway, Daisy floored the gas pedal.</t3426> <t3427>I tried to make her stop.</t3427> <t3428>But she just couldn't do it.</t3428> <t3429>Then I pulled the handbrake.</t3429> <t3430>She collapsed into my lap, half-unconscious.</t3430> <t3431>So I continued driving.</t3431><t3432>”</t3432>
<t3433>He paused and thought for a moment.</t3433>
<t3434>“There will be nothing left for tomorrow,” she said, “I want to stay here and prevent Tom from bothering him because of the unpleasant incident in the afternoon.</t3434> <t3435>She locked herself in her room.</t3435> <t3436>If her husband resorts to brute force, she will signal by turning the lights on and off.</t3436><t3437>”</t3437>
<t3438>“He won't do anything,” I said, “Right now, he's not thinking about Daisy.</t3438><t3439>”</t3439>
<t3440>“I don't trust her, buddy.</t3440><t3441>”</t3441>
<t3442>“How long will you wait?</t3442><t3443>”</t3443>
<t3444>“If necessary, all night.</t3444> <t3445>At least until everyone goes to bed.</t3445><t3446>”</t3446>
<t3447>There was a topic that was on my mind.</t3447> <t3448>I assumed that Tom realized Daisy was driving the car.</t3448> <t3449>He might have thought there was an intent or a connection.</t3449> <t3450>In fact, anything could have come to his mind.</t3450> <t3451>I turned my head and looked at their house.</t3451> <t3452>There were lights in two or three of the ground floor windows.</t3452> <t3453>On the upper floor, except for Daisy's room, the others were dark.</t3453>
<t3454>“Wait here,” I said, “let me go and check if there is a problem!”</t3454><t3455>”</t3455>
<t3456>I walked towards the house from the edge of the green area.</t3456> <t3457>I quietly crossed the gravel path and reached the back.</t3457> <t3458>Tiptoeing, I climbed the steps of the terrace.</t3458> <t3459>The curtain of the living room was open.</t3459> <t3460>There was no one inside.</t3460> <t3461>After passing the veranda where we had dinner three months ago on a June evening, I saw a rectangular-shaped light.</t3461> <t3462>This must have been the kitchen window.</t3462> <t3463>The curtains were closed, but I found a small gap and looked inside.</t3463>
<t3464>Daisy and Tom were sitting at the kitchen table.</t3464> <t3465>In the middle of the table, there was a plate with fried chicken, and in front of them, there were glasses of non-alcoholic beer.</t3465> <t3466>Tom was leaning towards Daisy, excitedly telling her something.</t3466> <t3467>His hand was on the table, over his wife's hand.</t3467> <t3468>Every now and then, Daisy would lift her head to look at him, nodding to show she agreed with what he was saying.</t3468> <t3469>They didn't look very happy.</t3469> <t3470>They hadn't touched the food in front of them, but they weren't unhappy either.</t3470> <t3471>In the visible scene, it was clear that there was an undeniable closeness between the couple.</t3471> <t3472>Anyone who saw them would think they were planning something together.</t3472>
<t3473>As I tiptoed down the stairs and turned back, I heard the summoned taxi advancing towards the house on the dark road.</t3473> <t3474>Gatsby was waiting for me where I had left him.</t3474>
<t3475>"How is it, is everything calm?" he asked anxiously.</t3475>
<t3476>“Yes, yes, calm down,” I said, and after pausing for a moment, I couldn't help but add, “You should come home with me and get some sleep too.”</t3476>
<t3477>He shook his head from side to side.</t3477>
<t3478>"I want to wait here until he goes to bed.</t3478> <t3479>Good night, buddy," he said.</t3479>
<t3480>He put his hands in his pockets and turned his back.</t3480> <t3481>He was ready to continue watching the house.</t3481> <t3482>He acted as if my presence was hindering his sacred duty.</t3482> <t3483>I left him waiting under the moonlight, keeping watch over something that wasn't there.</t3483> <t3484>I walked away and got into a taxi.</t3484>
<t3485>CHAPTER 8</t3485>
<t3486>I couldn't sleep all night; amidst the incessantly blowing foghorns on the Bosphorus, I was tossed between bizarre realities and wild, terrifying dreams.</t3486> <t3487>As dawn was breaking, I heard the sound of a taxi turning onto Gatsby's driveway and immediately jumped out of bed and started getting dressed.</t3487> <t3488>I thought there were things I needed to tell him, I needed to warn him, because if I waited until morning, it might be too late.</t3488> <t3489>After crossing the garden, I saw that the front door was open, and I found Gatsby sitting at the table in the foyer, exhausted from sleeplessness.</t3489>
<t3490>"Nothing happened," he said, his face was pale.</t3490> <t3491>"I waited; around four o'clock, he approached the window and stood there for about a minute, then he turned off the light.</t3491><t3492>"</t3492>
<t3493>Until that night when we searched for cigarettes together in those immensely large rooms, I hadn't realized how big Gatsby's house was.</t3493> <t3494>We struggled to pull the curtains aside as if they were stage curtains, traversing meters to reach the light switches, and at one point, I stumbled and fell onto the piano keys that appeared before me like a ghost.</t3494> <t3495>Interestingly, everything was covered in dust, and the rooms smelled musty as if they hadn't been aired out for days.</t3495> <t3496>I found the tobacco box on a peculiar table, and inside were two dried-up cigarettes.</t3496> <t3497>After opening the French windows of the guest room wide, we sat and smoked our cigarettes in the dark.</t3497>
<t3498>“You should go,” I said, “it's not unlikely that they will trace the car.</t3498><t3499>”</t3499>
<t3500>“How should I go now, buddy?</t3500><t3501>”</t3501>
<t3502>“Go to Atlantic City or Montreal and stay for a week.</t3502><t3503>”</t3503>
<t3504>He wasn't even considering doing this.</t3504> <t3505>He probably wouldn't leave her without finding out what Daisy would do.</t3505> <t3506>He was clinging to his last hope; and I couldn't tear him away from it.</t3506>
<t3507>He had also recounted the early years he spent with Dan Cody that night; the reason for his recounting was clear: in the face of Tom's treachery, "Jay Gatsby" had shattered into pieces, and the hidden and long love story had finally come to an end.</t3507> <t3508>Now, without any secrets, he could tell everything as it was.</t3508> <t3509>Nevertheless, what he really wanted to talk about was still Daisy.</t3509>
<t3510>Daisy was the first "graceful" girl he knew.</t3510> <t3511>He had met and had relationships with similar girls before, but he had always felt the presence of a barbed wire between them.</t3511> <t3512>He found Daisy excitingly attractive.</t3512> <t3513>He first went to her house with other officers from Taylor Camp, and later visited her alone.</t3513> <t3514>The house amazed him; he had never seen such a beautiful house before.</t3514> <t3515>However, it was, of course, Daisy's presence that gave the house its breathtaking atmosphere.</t3515> <t3516>Yet, just as it was ordinary for him to live in a tent at the camp, it was also ordinary for Daisy.</t3516> <t3517>The house had a mysterious air; the bedrooms upstairs were more beautiful and spacious than the others, and the corridors radiated joy and vitality.</t3517> <t3518>The romance in that house was not moldy; rather, it was preserved in lavender; the sparkle of the latest model cars always remained fresh and lively, and the flowers of the dance balls never wilted.</t3518> <t3519>Moreover, the multitude of Daisy's admirers excited him and increased her value in his eyes.</t3519> <t3520>In every corner of the house, he felt their presence, the shadows and reflections of their passionate feelings lingering in the air.</t3520>
<t3521>He was also aware that going to Daisy's house was a very big coincidence.</t3521> <t3522>No matter how bright his future was as Jay Gatsby, ultimately, he was a penniless young man without a past, and the invisible cloak of his uniform could slip off his shoulders at any moment.</t3522> <t3523>Therefore, he made good use of his time.</t3523> <t3524>He took whatever he could with passion and without thinking, and in the end, on a calm October evening, perhaps knowing that he didn't even have the right to hold her hand, he won Daisy over.</t3524>
<t3525>Actually, he should have been ashamed of himself because he had practically deceived the girl with lies and trickery to win her over.</t3525> <t3526>Of course, I'm not saying he took advantage of his imaginary millions for this, but somehow he had gained her trust, made her believe they were from the same social class, and convinced her that he could take care of her in the way she deserved.</t3526> <t3527>In reality, he had no such means; not only did he lack the support of a wealthy family, but he could also be sent to the farthest corner of the world at any moment by an order.</t3527>
<t3528>However, he did not feel ashamed of what he did, moreover, events did not unfold as he had imagined.</t3528> <t3529>In fact, his initial intention was to leave after taking what he could get, but he found himself chasing a dream.</t3529> <t3530>He already knew that Daisy was an extraordinary girl, but he hadn't realized at that time how exceptionally "graceful" she could be.</t3530> <t3531>When Daisy disappeared into her lavish life and her grand house, Gatsby was left standing there in the middle.</t3531> <t3532>At that moment, all he wanted was to marry her.</t3532>
<t3533>At their meeting two days later, it was Gatsby who was left breathless and feeling somehow betrayed.</t3533> <t3534>On the veranda illuminated by the luxury of purchased stars, when the girl approached him and Gatsby kissed her intriguing, beautiful lips, the wicker lounge chair gently creaked.</t3534> <t3535>Daisy had caught a cold; this made her voice sound huskier and more alluring than ever.</t3535> <t3536>When he realized that the enchanting vitality of that youth, that mystery, and those brand-new clothes, wrapped and protected by wealth, shone confidently and proudly like silver over the struggles and hardships of the poor, Gatsby's presence was filled with embarrassment and shame.</t3536>
<t3537>“I can't tell you how surprised I was when I realized I was in love with her, buddy.</t3537> <t3538>In fact, at one point, I even hoped she would brush me off, but she didn't.</t3538> <t3539>Because she had fallen for me too.</t3539> <t3540>She thought I was very cultured because I knew things different from what she knew.</t3540> <t3541>I had shed my ambitions and with each passing minute, I was falling for her more and more, all without me realizing, it happened all at once.</t3541> <t3542>What was the point of doing bigger things when I could spend time alone with her, telling her what I would do!</t3542><t3543>”</t3543>
<t3544>On the last day before leaving for duty, they had sat for a long time without saying a word, holding Daisy in his arms.</t3544> <t3545>It was a cold autumn day, and Daisy's cheeks were flushed from the heat of the fireplace.</t3545> <t3546>When Daisy moved, Gatsby slightly shifted his arm and then kissed her shining black hair.</t3546> <t3547>These midday hours had silenced them, as if wanting to leave them with memories they couldn't forget during the long days of separation that would start the next day.</t3547> <t3548>During their month-long relationship, they had never been this close, never entered such deep communication; as if afraid of waking Daisy up, Gatsby gently touched the girl's fingers, while Daisy brushed her silent lips against the shoulder of his jacket.</t3548>
<t3549>Gatsby had shown extraordinary achievements in the war, becoming a captain even before going to the front, and after the battle of Argonne, he was promoted to major and took command of the machine gun brigade.</t3549> <t3550>After the armistice, he tried to return to his country, but due to a misunderstanding or confusion, he found himself in Oxford.</t3550> <t3551>At that time, he was very worried because of the disappointment he sensed in Daisy's letters.</t3551> <t3552>Daisy could not understand why he couldn't return.</t3552> <t3553>She felt the pressure of the outside world, wanted to see him, feel his presence beside her, and ultimately be sure that she was doing the right thing by waiting for him.</t3553>
<t3554>After all, he was still very young and his fake world was filled with orchid scents, cheerful, pleasant, and self-satisfied people, and of course, orchestras that conveyed the meaning and sorrow of life with the year's fashionable rhythms.</t3554> <t3555>At nights, saxophones would cry with the hopeless rendition of "Beale Street Blues," and hundreds of pairs of gold and silver shoes would sweep the glittering dust off the floor.</t3555> <t3556>During the gray tea hours, while the halls smoldered with this soft and sweet fire, new faces would be swept from one place to another like scattered rose petals by the melancholy melodies pouring from the orchestra around the dance floor.</t3556>
<t3557>With the opening of the entertainment season, Daisy had started to show up again in this twilight world, just like before, dating half a dozen men a day, and at dawn, she would throw her necklace, the tulle of her evening dress, and her dried orchids beside her bed and fall asleep.</t3557> <t3558>However, something inside her was telling her that she needed to make a decision.</t3558> <t3559>She had to steer her life, and without delay.</t3559> <t3560>Love, money, or common sense, whichever was closest to her, she would steer her life with it!</t3560>
<t3561>In the middle of spring, Tom Buchanan entered her life, and she finally got what she had been waiting for.</t3561> <t3562>The young man's social status and appearance gave the impression of being reliable and solid, which flattered Daisy's pride.</t3562> <t3563>After struggling with indecision and doubt, she made her decision and felt relieved.</t3563> <t3564>The letter announcing this decision reached Gatsby while he was at Oxford.</t3564>
<t3565>Dawn was breaking on Long Island; we began to open all the windows on the lower floor together, the dawn turning from gray to gold filled the house.</t3565> <t3566>Suddenly, a tree shadow fell on the damp grass and birds began to chirp among its blue leaves.</t3566> <t3567>The light and pleasant breeze in the air indicated that it would be a cool and beautiful day.</t3567>
<t3568>"I don't think she ever loved Tom," said Gatsby, looking defiantly at me from the window he stood before, "We must not forget that what happened yesterday had a great impact on Daisy.</t3568> <t3569>The guy told everything in a way that would scare her, trying to make me look like a despicable fraud.</t3569> <t3570>Naturally, Daisy was not aware of what she was saying.</t3570><t3571>"</t3571>
<t3572>He sat in a corner in a sad state.</t3572>
<t3573>“Of course, when they first got married, he might have loved her for a moment, but he still loved me more, do you understand?</t3573><t3574>”</t3574>
<t3575>Suddenly, these strange words slipped out of his mouth, "Anyway, it was personal."</t3575><t3576>"</t3576>
<t3577>What meaning could be derived from this?</t3577> <t3578>Although I wasn't very sure, it was clear that he perceived everything with an immeasurable intensity.</t3578>
<t3579>While Tom and Daisy were on their honeymoon, Gatsby had returned from France; he couldn't help but make a miserable journey to Louisville with his last paycheck from the army.</t3579> <t3580>He stayed there for a week, wandered the streets they had walked together on a November night, and revisited the secluded places they had gone to with Daisy's little white car.</t3580> <t3581>Just as he had always found the house more mysterious and colorful than the others in those days, despite her absence, it was the same again, and he was once more struck by the melancholic beauty of the house.</t3581>
<t3582>As he was leaving Louisville, he kept saying to himself, ‘If I had conducted a more thorough investigation, I would have surely found her,’ and these thoughts made him feel like he was leaving the girl he loved behind.</t3582> <t3583>He was penniless, and the passenger car was very hot.</t3583> <t3584>He stepped into the passage between the cars, opened a folding chair, and sat down; the station and buildings he had never seen before were slipping past him.</t3584> <t3585>As they passed through the fields, he looked at a yellow car they were momentarily neck and neck with, and thought that the passengers inside might have accidentally seen Daisy’s white and enchanting face while walking on the street.</t3585> <t3586>The railway curved, and the train began to move away from the sun, which was spreading over the city where Daisy’s breath mingled, as if blessing it.</t3586> <t3587>With the desire to take a part of these places beautified by the woman he loved with him, he raised his hands and desperately tried to trap a piece of air in his palm.</t3587> <t3588>Everything was passing by very quickly in front of his tear-filled eyes; he felt that he had forever lost the most beautiful and exciting period of his life.</t3588>
<t3589>By nine o'clock, we had finished our breakfast and stepped out onto the veranda.</t3589> <t3590>During the night, the weather had suddenly turned; now there was the scent of autumn in the air.</t3590> <t3591>The gardener, the last of the old servants of the mansion, came and stood in front of the steps, "Mr. Gatsby, soon the leaves will start to fall; I think I'll drain the pool today, the pipes get clogged otherwise.</t3591><t3592>"</t3592>
<t3593>“Don't touch it today,” said Gatsby, then he turned to me and apologetically said, “You know buddy, I haven't gone into this pool even once all summer,” he said.</t3593>
<t3594>Looking at the time, I stood up, "I have twelve minutes left for my train," I said.</t3594>
<t3595>I didn't want to go to the city; I didn't want to travel that far just for accounting, but the main reason for my reluctance was that I didn't feel right leaving Gatsby alone.</t3595> <t3596>By the time I left the house, I had missed the train, and even the next one.</t3596>
<t3597>"I'll call you," I said finally as I was leaving.</t3597>
<t3598>“Well then, buddy.</t3598><t3599>”</t3599>
<t3600>“Around noon, then,” we slowly descended.</t3600>
<t3601>"Maybe Daisy will call too," he said, looking at my face anxiously, as if seeking approval.</t3601>
<t3602>“I think he will call too.</t3602><t3603>”</t3603>
<t3604>“Well then, goodbye.</t3604><t3605>”</t3605>
<t3606>We shook hands, and I was heading home when something came to my mind by the fence, and I turned around and shouted: "They're all worthless bastards!" Even if they all came together, they wouldn't amount to one of you.</t3606><t3607>"</t3607>
<t3608>I have always been pleased to have said this.</t3608> <t3609>This was the only compliment I made to her, because I did not approve of anything she did from beginning to end.</t3609>
<t3610>First, she nodded gracefully, then that radiant and understanding smile spread across her face as if we had always been in this together.</t3610> <t3611>Her flashy pink suit looked like a bright spot on the marble stairs.</t3611> <t3612>I remembered that night three months ago when I first went to her house.</t3612> <t3613>A crowd of people, speculating about her deceit, had filled her house and garden; she, however, had stood on these steps while bidding farewell to her guests, waving after us, concealing that pristine thought from all of us.</t3613>
<t3614>I thanked him for his hospitality.</t3614> <t3615>In fact, all the guests, all of us, would often thank him for it.</t3615>
<t3616>“Goodbye!” I called out.</t3616> <t3617>“The breakfast was very nice, thank you.</t3617><t3618>”</t3618>
<t3619>When I arrived in the city, I started preparing the endless list of promissory notes; however, I soon fell asleep in my revolving chair.</t3619> <t3620>At noon, I woke up with a start to the sound of the phone, and beads of sweat were dripping from my forehead.</t3620> <t3621>It was Jordan Baker; she usually called around this time because the uncertainty and lack of planning in her shuttling between hotels, clubs, or house parties didn't allow her to call at other times.</t3621> <t3622>Usually, her voice on the phone sounded lively and fresh, as if a piece of grass from the green golf course had suddenly entered my office through the window, but that morning it was dry and sharp.</t3622>
<t3623>"I just left Daisy, I'm in Hampstead," he said, "I'll head to Southampton in the afternoon.</t3623><t3624>"</t3624>
<t3625>Although leaving the house was a considerate gesture, frankly, it had disturbed me, and I was utterly frozen by what he said last.</t3625>
<t3626>“You were not kind to me at all last night.</t3626><t3627>”</t3627>
<t3628>“What importance could it have had at that moment?</t3628>
<t3629>There was a moment of silence, then, "I still want us to meet.</t3629><t3630>"</t3630>
<t3631>“Me too.</t3631><t3632>”</t3632>
<t3633>“Well, what if I come to the city instead of Southampton in the afternoon.</t3633><t3634>”</t3634>
<t3635>“Actually, I don't think it will be possible this afternoon.</t3635><t3636>”</t3636>
<t3637>"Alright."</t3637><t3638></t3638>
<t3639>“Today is impossible because I have a lot of - ”</t3639>
<t3640>Our conversation continued like this for a while longer; then we both fell silent.</t3640> <t3641>I'm not aware of which of us hung up the phone first; frankly, it didn't matter.</t3641> <t3642>Even if we were never to meet again, I was not in a state to have tea and chat with him today.</t3642>
<t3643>I called Gatsby shortly after; the line was busy.</t3643> <t3644>After persistently trying four times, an irate operator finally told me that the line was being kept open for a long-distance call with Detroit.</t3644> <t3645>I took the train schedule out of my pocket and marked the 15.</t3645> <t3646>50 train by circling it.</t3646> <t3647>It was noon, and I leaned back and tried to think.</t3647>
<t3648>That morning, as we passed through the heaps of ashes by train, I got up in the compartment and sat on the opposite side.</t3648> <t3649>I thought I would see a curious crowd there, that their little children would search for dried blood stains on the dust, that a chatterbox would narrate the incident so much that they would eventually stop believing their own words and cease telling the story, and thus, the tragic Myrtle Wilson incident would be forgotten.</t3649>
<t3650>Now, I want to go back a bit and tell you about what happened after we left there the previous night.</t3650>
<t3651>It had been difficult to find her sister Catherine.</t3651> <t3652>She must have abandoned her decision to stay away from alcohol, at least for that night, as I heard she had gone to the scene dead drunk.</t3652> <t3653>She had a hard time realizing that the ambulance had already set off for Flushing, and when she finally understood, she fainted right there as if this was the most tragic part of the whole incident.</t3653> <t3654>One of those present, perhaps out of curiosity or maybe out of pity for the poor girl, took the woman into their car and followed the ambulance carrying her sister's body.</t3654>
<t3655>As the hours passed and it got well past midnight, another group had gathered in front of the repair shop.</t3655> <t3656>Meanwhile, George Wilson was rocking back and forth on the couch in his office; since the door to the office was wide open, everyone who entered the garage couldn't help but watch the man.</t3656> <t3657>Finally, someone had the sense to close the door, deeming it inappropriate.</t3657> <t3658>Michaelis and four or five others stayed there with the man for a while; then the number of this group dwindled to two or three.</t3658> <t3659>Eventually, Michaelis asked the last person to stay for another fifteen minutes, during which he went to his shop, made coffee, brought it to the repair shop, and stayed with Wilson until morning.</t3659>
<t3660>Towards the morning, around three o'clock, Wilson's meaningless ramblings, sobs, and groans had subsided; after calming down a bit, he started talking about the yellow car.</t3660> <t3661>He said he would definitely investigate and find out who the car belonged to, then began to tell how his wife had returned from the city about two months ago with a swollen nose and her face covered in bruises.</t3661> <t3662>Then he shuddered again and was overwhelmed with sobs, starting to moan, 'Oh, my God!'</t3662> <t3663>Michaelis, in a futile attempt to divert his attention, asked, 'How long have you been married, George?'</t3663> <t3664>'Come on, pull yourself together a bit, try to calm down and answer my question.</t3664> <t3665>How long have you been married?</t3665><t3666>'</t3666>
<t3667>"For twelve years."</t3667><t3668>"</t3668>
<t3669>"Do you have a child?</t3669> <t3670>Come on, stop stalling, I asked you a question: Do you have a child?</t3670><t3671>"</t3671>
<t3672>Whenever Michaelis heard the sound of a car from outside, he likened the engine noise to that of the car he had failed to stop a few hours earlier.</t3672> <t3673>Since the large table on which the corpse had been placed was still covered in blood after the unfortunate accident, Michaelis avoided entering the garage.</t3673> <t3674>Having nothing else to do but sit restlessly in the office, he had examined everything in the room one by one until morning, occasionally sitting next to Wilson and continuing his efforts to calm him down.</t3674>
<t3675>"Do you go to church, George? Even if you haven't gone for a long time, it's not a problem.</t3675> <t3676>If you want, I can call right now and find a priest to talk to you.</t3676><t3677>"</t3677>
<t3678>“I am not affiliated with any church.</t3678><t3679>”</t3679>
<t3680>“You should be, George, especially for times like these.</t3680> <t3681>You must have gone to a church at least once in your life.</t3681> <t3682>For example, when you got married.</t3682> <t3683>Are you listening, George?</t3683> <t3684>Listen to me, didn't you get married in a church?</t3684><t3685>”</t3685>
<t3686>“This was a long time ago.</t3686><t3687>”</t3687>
<t3688>The effort he made to respond had somewhat prevented him from swaying and made him stop talking for a moment.</t3688> <t3689>Then, a slightly surprised, slightly suggestive look appeared in his swollen eyes:</t3689>
<t3690>"Could you open that drawer?" he said, pointing to the writing desk.</t3690>
<t3691>"Which one?</t3691><t3692>"</t3692>
<t3693>“That one, over there.</t3693><t3694>”</t3694>
<t3695>When Michaelis opened the nearest drawer, he found a small, leather-made, silver-trimmed, expensive dog collar inside.</t3695> <t3696>It looked as if it were new.</t3696>
<t3697>“There is this,” Michaelis had said, pointing to the leash.</t3697>
<t3698>Wilson nodded, "Yes, I found it yesterday.</t3698> <t3699>My wife told me something, but I sensed there was something illogical.</t3699><t3700>"</t3700>
<t3701>"Did your wife buy this?"</t3701><t3702>"</t3702>
<t3703>“Yes, I found it wrapped in a handkerchief on top of the dresser.</t3703><t3704>”</t3704>
<t3705>Michaelis, who couldn't see anything strange in this, had listed a bunch of reasons for the woman to take the leash.</t3705> <t3706>But Wilson must have heard similar explanations from Myrtle, as he started to moan again, "Oh, God, oh!" and Michaelis's attempt to comfort him caused these possible reasons to remain unresolved.</t3706>
<t3707>Then Wilson had said, "He killed that man," his tongue loosening.</t3707>
<t3708>“Which man?</t3708><t3709>”</t3709>
<t3710>“I will learn this somehow.</t3710><t3711>”</t3711>
<t3712>"You're not well, George," his friend had said, "You still haven't gotten over the shock of the incident, you don't know what you're saying.</t3712> <t3713>It would be better if you tried to sit calmly until morning.</t3713><t3714>"</t3714>
<t3715>“He killed the man.</t3715><t3716>”</t3716>
<t3717>“It was an accident, George.</t3717><t3718>”</t3718>
<t3719>Wilson shook his head from side to side, then squinted his eyes and spread his mouth into a thoughtful expression; "No, it wasn't.</t3719> <t3720>I know.</t3720> <t3721>The people around me trust me, and besides, I normally wouldn't even think that someone would hurt anyone.</t3721> <t3722>But if I say I know something, I know it.</t3722> <t3723>The man in the car was him.</t3723> <t3724>Myrtle stepped out to talk to him, but he didn't stop.</t3724><t3725>"</t3725>
<t3726>Actually, Michaelis had seen it that way too, but it hadn't seemed to him as if there was a special reason for it.</t3726> <t3727>He had thought that Mrs. Wilson was trying to stop that car not for any other reason, but because she was trying to escape from her husband.</t3727>
<t3728>“How could your wife have done this?</t3728><t3729>”</t3729>
<t3730>“She was an incomprehensible woman,” said Wilson, as if that was the answer to the question, “Oh, oh!</t3730><t3731>”</t3731>
<t3732>Then it had started to shake again, and Michaelis stood there tugging at the leash in his hand.</t3732>
<t3733>“Is there a friend you want me to call?”</t3733> <t3734>It was an empty hope; he was almost certain the man didn’t have a single friend; after all, he hadn’t even managed to win his wife’s friendship.</t3734> <t3735>A little later, when he noticed through the window that the sky was turning blue, Michaelis was pleased.</t3735> <t3736>By five o’clock, the daylight outside was enough to turn off the light in the office.</t3736>
<t3737>Wilson's expressionless gaze was fixed on the ash heaps, where the clouds were drifting here and there under the influence of the light morning breeze, forming interesting shapes.</t3737>
<t3738>“I had spoken to him,” Wilson murmured after a long silence.</t3738> <t3739>“I told him that he could deceive me, but he could never deceive God, then I took him to the window…” at that moment, he struggled to get up and moved towards the window at the back, then continued with his cheek pressed against the glass, “God knows what you have done, I told him, He sees everything you do!</t3739> <t3740>You can deceive me but never the all-seeing God!</t3740><t3741>”</t3741>
<t3742>When Michaelis realized that he was speaking while looking at the eyes of Doctor T.</t3742> <t3743>J.</t3743> <t3744>Eckleburg, who had just appeared with his large, dull blue eyes as the night dissipated, he was astonished.</t3744>
<t3745>"God sees everything!" Wilson had repeated.</t3745>
<t3746>Michaelis, trying to instill confidence in him by saying, "It's just a billboard," had caused the man to turn his gaze from the window to the room, prompted by something he couldn't understand at that moment.</t3746> <t3747>Wilson, on the other hand, was still there, his face pressed against the window frame, continuing to shake his head as he stared at the brightening sky.</t3747>
<t3748>Michaelis was quite pleased to hear a car stop outside around six o'clock because he was too exhausted to stand.</t3748> <t3749>The person who arrived was the man who had waited with them at the garage the previous night and had promised to return when he left.</t3749> <t3750>After Michaelis prepared breakfast for the three of them, they all sat down and ate together.</t3750>
<t3751>Taking advantage of Wilson having relatively calmed down at that moment, Michaelis had gone home to get some sleep.</t3751> <t3752>However, when he rushed back to the repair shop after four hours of sleep, Wilson was nowhere to be found.</t3752> <t3753>It was later understood where the man had gone: he had walked to Port Roosevelt and from there to Gad’s Hill, ordered a cup of coffee and a sandwich but had not even touched the sandwich.</t3753> <t3754>The fact that he had walked slowly due to his exhaustion explained why he only reached Gad’s Hill around noon.</t3754> <t3755>It had not been difficult to learn what he did at Gad’s Hill.</t3755> <t3756>For children had seen a man “acting like a madman,” and drivers had seen a man standing by the roadside looking at them strangely.</t3756> <t3757>However, no one had seen him in the last three hours.</t3757> <t3758>Having received the information that the man had told Michaelis the previous night ‘I will find out about this somehow,’ the police thought he might have spent this time visiting nearby garages to investigate the yellow car.</t3758> <t3759>Yet, none of the garage owners had seen him.</t3759> <t3760>Therefore, it was considered that he had found an easier and more certain way to learn what he wanted.</t3760> <t3761>Later, it was heard that he was seen in West Egg around half-past two in the afternoon, asking someone about Gatsby’s house.</t3761> <t3762>So by that time, he had already obtained Gatsby’s name.</t3762>
<t3763>At two o'clock, Gatsby, who had put on his swimsuit, told his servant that he would be at the swimming pool in case a phone call came.</t3763> <t3764>He stopped by his garage, found the air mattress that had entertained his guests all summer, and then inflated it with the help of his driver.</t3764> <t3765>Before leaving, he ordered that his convertible should not be taken out of the garage under any circumstances, but since the front bumper needed to be fixed, this order seemed quite strange to his staff.</t3765>
<t3766>Gatsby shouldered his inflatable mattress and headed towards the pool, occasionally stopping to adjust his load. Although the chauffeur, who saw him, offered to help, he shook his head to indicate he didn't want any assistance.</t3766> <t3767>Then he disappeared among the trees that had started to turn yellow.</t3767>
<t3768>There had been no phone call, but the butler still gave up his nap that afternoon and waited until four o'clock, though if it were going to come, the news would have already arrived by then.</t3768> <t3769>If you ask me, Gatsby also knew that the call he was waiting for wouldn't come, and perhaps he wasn't relying on it much anymore.</t3769> <t3770>If this is true, he must have been thinking that he had lost his old warm world and was paying a heavy price for living with just a dream for so long.</t3770> <t3771>He had probably lifted his head and looked at an unfamiliar sky through the frightening leaves, shuddering as he noticed how strange the roses were and how the sun's rays looked so raw on the newly sprouting sparse grass.</t3771> <t3772>It was a new world where unfortunate ghosts, breathing dreams instead of air, wandered aimlessly; an unreal material, just like that gray and bizarre shadowy unfortunate ghost he saw gliding towards him through the pale and shapeless trees...</t3772>
<t3773>The driver under Wolfsheim's patronage had heard the gunshot, but as he later mentioned, he thought it was unrelated to them.</t3773> <t3774>After getting off the train, my hurried drive to Gatsby's house and my frantic rush up the stairs were the first things that alarmed the household.</t3774> <t3775>But at that moment, I'm sure they suddenly understood everything.</t3775> <t3776>The driver, the butler, the gardener, and I...</t3776> <t3777>All four of us, without saying a single word, ran to the pool at once.</t3777>
<t3778>The clean water entering from one side of the pool and exiting from the other side creates a slight current on the surface, and these tiny ripples cause the inflatable mattress to move back and forth along with its load.</t3778> <t3779>Although the sudden wind only causes small ripples on the surface of the water, it is enough to change the random course of the mattress and its unfortunate load, and the touch of a cluster of leaves turns this mattress like a compass needle on a thin and red circle in the water.</t3779>
<t3780>While we were all carrying Gatsby home together, the gardener saw Wilson's corpse lying on the grass a little further away.</t3780> <t3781>The massacre was complete!</t3781>
<t3782>CHAPTER 9</t3782>
<t3783>After two years, from the day of the incident, the night, and the following day, what remained in my mind were the relentless visits of the police, photographers, and journalists, wearing down Gatsby's door.</t3783> <t3784>Although a tape guarded by a police officer was stretched in front of the garden gate to keep the curious away, the children soon discovered that they could pass through my yard to the house.</t3784> <t3785>Therefore, there was no shortage of people standing by the pool, looking around with their mouths open.</t3785> <t3786>A man, whom I guessed to be a detective and who seemed extremely sensible, used the term 'mad' while leaning over Wilson's corpse that day; the unusual authority in his voice carried this word to the headlines of the next day.</t3786>
<t3787>Most of what was written was like a nightmare; strange, irrelevant, provocative, and fabricated lines.</t3787> <t3788>When Michaelis stated that Wilson was suspicious of his wife's fidelity, I thought that at least for a while, this whole story would provide material for harsh and fiery criticisms.</t3788> <t3789>However, Catherine, whom I thought could explain everything, had not uttered a single word.</t3789> <t3790>In fact, displaying a surprising sense of judgment on the matter, she had looked at the inquest judge with determined eyes from under her plucked eyebrows and sworn that her sister had never known Gatsby, that she had a very happy marriage with her husband, and that she had never betrayed him.</t3790> <t3791>She seemed to have convinced herself of what she said, as she kept crying with a handkerchief in her hand, as if to show that such a claim was beyond her endurance.</t3791> <t3792>Thus, without further probing into the matter, Wilson was labeled as a man who had 'lost his sanity due to the suffering he experienced,' and the case was closed!</t3792>
<t3793>However, this aspect of the matter was already unimportant to me.</t3793> <t3794>Because I had been left all alone on Gatsby's side.</t3794> <t3795>After calling the people I deemed necessary in West Egg to deliver the bad news, all the suspicions about him, all those unanswered questions, had started to be directed at me.</t3795> <t3796>At first, I was surprised, even bewildered; but then, as he lay there breathless, motionless, and silent in his home, I began to feel a sense of responsibility with each passing hour, because there was no one else to care for him.</t3796> <t3797>By care, I mean that intense personal attention that every person deserves at the end of their life.</t3797>
<t3798>Half an hour after finding him in the pool, I instinctively called Daisy without thinking.</t3798> <t3799>However, that afternoon I learned that they had left the house with a few suitcases along with Tom.</t3799>
<t3800>“Didn't they leave an address?</t3800><t3801>”</t3801>
<t3802>“No.</t3802><t3803>”</t3803>
<t3804>"Did they say when they will return?"</t3804>
<t3805>“No.</t3805><t3806>”</t3806>
<t3807>“Don't you know where they are?</t3807> <t3808>I need to reach them?</t3808><t3809>”</t3809>
<t3810>“I don't know, unfortunately.</t3810><t3811>”</t3811>
<t3812>I wanted to find someone for him.</t3812> <t3813>Going to that room where he lay, I wanted to say, "Don't worry, Gatsby.</t3813> <t3814>I will make sure someone comes for you, don't be sad.</t3814> <t3815>Trust me, I will definitely bring someone," to comfort him.</t3815>
<t3816>Meyer Wolfsheim's name was not in the directory.</t3816> <t3817>The servant found the address of his office on Broadway for me; I got his number from the switchboard; but by the time I reached his number, it was already past five o'clock, so no one answered the phone.</t3817>
<t3818>“Would you call again?</t3818><t3819>”</t3819>
<t3820>“I called three times.</t3820><t3821>”</t3821>
<t3822>“This is very important.</t3822><t3823>”</t3823>
<t3824>“I'm sorry.</t3824> <t3825>I'm afraid there's no one.”</t3825> <t3826>I returned to the guest room again; for a moment, I thought that all these officers filling the hall were, in a way, his visitors too.</t3826> <t3827>But as they kept pulling back the sheet and looking at Gatsby with motionless eyes, I felt as if I could hear his objection.</t3827>
<t3828>"Buddy; you must find someone for me.</t3828> <t3829>Come on, try a little harder!</t3829> <t3830>I don't want to finish this job alone.</t3830><t3831>"</t3831>
<t3832>A man approached and started asking some questions; I barely managed to escape from him and went upstairs.</t3832> <t3833>He had never explicitly told me that his parents were dead, so I hurriedly rummaged through the unlocked drawers of his desk, hoping to find a clue, but there was nothing in the room related to his past except for the photo of Dan Cody on the wall, which symbolized his complicated past.</t3833>
<t3834>The next morning, I handed the letter I had written to Wolfsheim to the servant and sent him to New York.</t3834> <t3835>I wanted him to come on the first train and inform me of the situation.</t3835> <t3836>Although this seemed unnecessary to me while writing; as soon as he saw the newspapers, he would definitely set out; moreover, I was sure I would receive a telegram from Daisy before noon.</t3836> <t3837>However, neither the telegram nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived; no one came except for more police, photographers, and reporters.</t3837> <t3838>When the servant brought Wolfsheim's reply, a sense of rebellion arose within me, and I felt a solidarity between Gatsby and myself that scorned them all.</t3838>
<t3839>Dear Mr. Carraway,</t3839>
<t3840>This is one of the most shocking disasters I have experienced in my life, I can't comprehend that all of this has happened.</t3840> <t3841>The madness that man has committed should make us all think.</t3841> <t3842>It is not possible for me to come there right now.</t3842> <t3843>Due to very important matters, I cannot move from where I am and cannot be among you.</t3843> <t3844>If there is anything I can do later, please write to me and send it with Edgar.</t3844>
<t3845>Believe me, I am devastated in the face of such incidents; I am shattered by this incident as well, and I am at a loss for words and actions.</t3845>
<t3846>Yours sincerely,</t3846>
<t3847>MEYER WOLFSHEIM</t3847>
<t3848>He had carelessly scribbled the following lines at the bottom of the letter:</t3848>
<t3849>‘Let me know about the needs related to the funeral and other arrangements.</t3849> <t3850>I have no information about his family.</t3850><t3851>’</t3851>
<t3852>When they said a call had come from Chicago that day, I thought Daisy had finally come to her senses: but when the connection was made, I heard a faint male voice from the depths.</t3852>
<t3853>"Ben Slagle."</t3853><t3854>"</t3854>
<t3855>"Here you go," I had never heard this name before.</t3855>
<t3856>"What's up, man! Did you get my telegram?"</t3856><t3857>"</t3857>
<t3858>“No telegram or anything came.</t3858><t3859>”</t3859>
<t3860>“Young Parke is in trouble,” he was speaking quickly, “He got caught as soon as he put the bonds on the market over the counter.</t3860> <t3861>Apparently, a circular with the registered numbers had been sent from New York five minutes earlier.</t3861> <t3862>What do you think about that?</t3862> <t3863>Who knows what might happen to him in this backwater - ”</t3863>
<t3864>"Hello!" I interrupted, breathless, "Listen to me, I am not Gatsby, Mr. Gatsby is dead.</t3864><t3865>"</t3865>
<t3866>There was a long silence on the other end of the line, then a cry of surprise was heard.</t3866> <t3867>After that, the signal started beeping, they had hung up!</t3867>
<t3868>If I'm not mistaken, on the third day, a telegram arrived from a Minnesota town, signed by Henry C.</t3868> <t3869>Gatz.</t3869> <t3870>The sender had written only that he would set out immediately and that the funeral should be delayed until he arrived.</t3870>
<t3871>The dignified, bewildered, and exhausted old man who had arrived was Gatsby's father.</t3871> <t3872>On that warm September day, he was wrapped in an old and long coat.</t3872> <t3873>Probably from excitement, his eyes were constantly watering.</t3873> <t3874>As I took his bag and umbrella, he started tugging at his sparse and graying beard, and since he wouldn't stop, I had quite a hard time taking off his coat.</t3874> <t3875>He looked exhausted, so I took him to the music room and settled him in a chair, then sent for some food.</t3875> <t3876>However, he didn't eat anything, and when he tried to drink the milk, he spilled it all over himself due to his trembling hands.</t3876>
<t3877>“I read it in the Chicago newspaper; they wrote everything.</t3877> <t3878>I set out immediately,” he said.</t3878>
<t3879>“I didn't know how to reach you.</t3879><t3880>”</t3880>
<t3881>He was constantly looking around with unseeing eyes.</t3881>
<t3882>“He must be crazy!” he said, “Of course, if he weren't crazy, would he ever do this?</t3882><t3883>”</t3883>
<t3884>"Would you like some coffee?" I asked.</t3884>
<t3885>"I don't want anything."</t3885> <t3886>"I feel better now, Mr. --?"</t3886>
<t3887>“Carraway.</t3887><t3888>”</t3888>
<t3889>“Yes, I'm quite fine like this.</t3889> <t3890>Where is Jimmy?</t3890><t3891>”</t3891>
<t3892>I took him to the guest room where his son was sleeping and left his side.</t3892> <t3893>A few little ones were curiously looking at the foyer from the top of the stairs.</t3893> <t3894>After I told them who the arriving person was, they reluctantly moved away.</t3894>
<t3895>Not long after, Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out; his lips slightly parted, his face slightly flushed, and tears streaming from his eyes.</t3895> <t3896>He was at an age where death was no longer sudden.</t3896> <t3897>After a while, he lifted his head and looked around carefully for the first time; seeing the height and grandeur of the living room and the enormous rooms opening from here to other rooms, a tremendous pride mixed with his sorrow.</t3897> <t3898>I accompanied him as he went up to one of the bedrooms upstairs.</t3898> <t3899>As he took off his coat and vest, I told him that we hadn't started the funeral preparations yet because we were waiting for him.</t3899>
<t3900>“We didn't know what kind of ceremony you wanted, Mr. Gatsby.</t3900><t3901>”</t3901>
<t3902>“My name is Gatz.</t3902><t3903>”</t3903>
<t3904>"Yes, Mr. Gatz.</t3904> <t3905>Maybe you would like to take him to the West.</t3905><t3906>"</t3906>
<t3907>He shook his head, meaning no, "Jimmy would have preferred the East.</t3907> <t3908>He got everything he desired here.</t3908> <t3909>Were you a friend of my son, Mr. --?</t3909><t3910>"</t3910>
<t3911>“We were close friends.</t3911><t3912>”</t3912>
<t3913>“His future was very bright, you know.</t3913> <t3914>How old was he anyway?</t3914> <t3915>Still, his mind worked very well,” he had said, bringing his hand to his head with pride.</t3915> <t3916>I nodded in agreement.</t3916>
<t3917>"If he had lived, he would have become a great man, like James J.</t3917> <t3918>Hill.</t3918> <t3919>He would have served the development of his country.</t3919><t3920>"</t3920>
<t3921>"You're right," I said, not really believing it.</t3921>
<t3922>She started tugging at the embroidered bedspread, and although it was difficult, she managed to open it.</t3922> <t3923>She lay stiffly on the bed and fell asleep immediately afterward.</t3923>
<t3924>That night, a man with a sense of urgency in his voice called and insisted on learning my name before saying who he was.</t3924> <t3925>Finally:</t3925>
<t3926>"Ben Carraway," I said</t3926>
<t3927>“Ah, is that so?” he said, his voice sounding relieved. “I am Klipspringer.” I too was relieved at the thought that finally a friend who wanted to attend Gatsby’s funeral had emerged.</t3927> <t3928>In order to prevent a curious crowd from gathering, I did not want to announce the day and time of the ceremony in the newspaper.</t3928> <t3929>Therefore, although it was never easy to reach people, I was trying to inform them of the day and time by calling around myself.</t3929>
<t3930>“The ceremony is tomorrow,” I said, “at 3 PM, it will be held here at his own house; I would appreciate it if you could inform those who are interested.</t3930><t3931>”</t3931>
<t3932>“Oh, of course,” he said immediately, “I don't think I'll see anyone, but if I do, I'll certainly tell them.</t3932><t3933>”</t3933>
<t3934>His tone made me suspicious, "Of course, you will come," I said.</t3934>
<t3935>“Of course, of course, I will try to come.</t3935> <t3936>I was going to -”</t3936>
<t3937>"One minute," I interrupted, "First, why don't you say for sure whether you will come or not?</t3937><t3938>"</t3938>
<t3939>"Actually, the thing is, I am currently with some friends in Greenwich.</t3939> <t3940>And they expect me to join them tomorrow, they've planned a picnic or something like that.</t3940> <t3941>But of course, I will do my best to get out of it.</t3941><t3942>"</t3942>
<t3943>I couldn't hold myself back, I blurted out, "Ha!" He must have heard my voice because he continued in an irritated manner: "The reason I'm calling is the shoes I left there, if it's not too much trouble, I would be very grateful if you could send them to me with the servant.</t3943> <t3944>They are my tennis shoes, you know, I would be in a difficult situation without them.</t3944> <t3945>Here is the address: B.</t3945> <t3946>By F.'s hand –"</t3946>
<t3947>I didn't hear the rest because I had hung up the phone.</t3947> <t3948>Later, when one of the gentlemen I called implied that Gatsby got what he deserved, I felt ashamed on Gatsby's behalf.</t3948> <t3949>But the fault was mine, because he was one of the most critical of Gatsby for attempting bootlegging, I should have known not to call him.</t3949>
<t3950>On the morning of the funeral, I went to New York to see Meyer Wolfsheim; it seemed like I couldn't reach him any other way.</t3950> <t3951>On the door directed by the elevator boy, it said 'Swastika Holding': when I pushed the door and entered, I saw that no one was there.</t3951> <t3952>I called out 'Hello' a few times in vain, then I noticed some arguing voices coming from behind the partitions, and immediately after, a beautiful Jewish woman came out from one of the inner rooms and scrutinized me with her black eyes, with a hostile attitude.</t3952>
<t3953>“There is no one,” he said.</t3953> <t3954>“Mr. Wolfsheim is in Chicago.</t3954><t3955>”</t3955>
<t3956>However, it immediately became apparent that what they were saying was a lie, because someone inside had started to play the song 'Rosary' with a discordant whistle.</t3956>
<t3957>"Please tell him that Mr. Carraway wants to see him."</t3957><t3958></t3958>
<t3959>“Do you think it’s possible for me to bring him from Chicago?</t3959> <t3960>Just then, someone called out “Stella” from behind the door, and it was undoubtedly Wolfsheim’s voice.</t3960>
<t3961>"Leave your card on the table, I will definitely give it to him as soon as he returns," he said quickly.</t3961>
<t3962>“But I know that he is inside.</t3962><t3963>”</t3963>
<t3964>He took a step closer and raised his hands in anger, then placed them on his hips and scolded, "You young people thought you could drop by here whenever you wanted," saying, "We are fed up and tired of it!</t3964> <t3965>If I say it's in Chicago, it's in Chicago.</t3965><t3966>"</t3966>
<t3967>I told her about Gatsby.</t3967>
<t3968>"Ah!</t3968><t3969>"</t3969>
<t3970>After scrutinizing me once more, “One moment...</t3970> <t3971>What was your name?</t3971><t3972>”</t3972>
<t3973>He disappeared.</t3973> <t3974>Soon after, Meyer Wolfsheim appeared at the door with a dignified expression on his face, extending both hands as he approached.</t3974> <t3975>Taking my hand between his, he said in a respectful voice that these days were sorrowful and difficult for all of us, then took me to his office and offered me a cigar.</t3975>
<t3976>“I remember the day we first met,” he said.</t3976> <t3977>“He was a young major, freshly discharged, with his chest full of medals earned in the war.</t3977> <t3978>He was so hard up that he couldn't afford civilian clothes and walked around in his uniform.</t3978> <t3979>When I first saw him, he had come to the Winebrenner billiard hall on 43rd Street to ask for a job.</t3979> <t3980>He hadn't had a bite to eat for two days.</t3980> <t3981>‘Come, let's eat together,’ I had said.</t3981> <t3982>He devoured four dollars' worth of food in half an hour.</t3982><t3983>”</t3983>
<t3984>"Did you hire him?" I asked</t3984>
<t3985>"I didn't just hire him!</t3985> <t3986>I created him-"</t3986>
<t3987>“Hey!</t3987><t3988>’”</t3988>
<t3989>“I created him from nothing, pulled him out of the mire.</t3989> <t3990>It was evident at first glance that he was actually a well-groomed young gentleman; moreover, when I heard he had studied at Oggsford, I was sure he would benefit me as well.</t3990> <t3991>I got him into the American Legion, where he also proved himself and gained respect, immediately solving a client's issue from Albany.</t3991> <t3992>We bonded, became inseparable.</t3992> <t3993>That's how we were!” he said, bringing his two chubby fingers together to show, “as you can understand, nothing could come between us.</t3993><t3994>”</t3994>
<t3995>I was wondering if they had any involvement in the match-fixing scandal of the 1919 World Cup.</t3995>
<t3996>“He is no longer alive,” I said a minute later, “As his closest friend, I am sure you will be at the funeral ceremony this afternoon.</t3996><t3997>”</t3997>
<t3998>"I would like to come"</t3998>
<t3999>"Then let's go."</t3999><t4000>"</t4000>
<t4001>The thick hairs sprouting from his nostrils seemed to tremble again; as he shook his head from side to side, his eyes filled with tears.</t4001>
<t4002>“I can't, I can't get involved in this.</t4002><t4003>”</t4003>
<t4004>"There is no issue to interfere with; everything is over now.</t4004><t4005>"</t4005>
<t4006>“If there is a murdered man involved, I absolutely do not want to get involved in that matter.</t4006> <t4007>I stay away.</t4007> <t4008>Was I like this when I was young?</t4008> <t4009>It was different then of course: when a friend of mine died, even if my hands were covered in blood, I would be by his side to send him off on his final journey.</t4009> <t4010>You might find me overly emotional, but even if it ended in death, I would be there for him.</t4010><t4011>”</t4011>
<t4012>I understood that he had his own reasons for not coming, and I stood up to leave.</t4012>
<t4013>“Did you go to university?” he asked, out of the blue.</t4013> <t4014>For a moment, I thought he was going to propose a 'partnership' as he would say, but I was wrong; he just greeted me and shook my hand.</t4014>
<t4015>“It is important to show affection to our friends while they are alive, not after they have died!” he pontificated.</t4015> <t4016>“After death, I leave everything just as it is.</t4016><t4017>”</t4017>
<t4018>When I left there, I noticed the dark clouds gathered in the sky; as soon as I reached West Egg, it started to rain.</t4018> <t4019>I changed my clothes and immediately went to my neighbor's house.</t4019> <t4020>I found Mr. Gatz pacing up and down in the living room; he was very excited.</t4020> <t4021>He was becoming increasingly proud of his son and his son's wealth.</t4021> <t4022>He said he wanted to show me something.</t4022>
<t4023>“With trembling hands, he took out a photo from his wallet, "Jimmy had sent this to me," he said, "Look!</t4023><t4024>"</t4024>
<t4025>This was a photo of the house we were in.</t4025> <t4026>The edges were worn, and it was dirty from being passed from hand to hand.</t4026> <t4027>"Look at this?" he eagerly showed me all the details, then looked at me, searching for a sign of admiration in my eyes.</t4027> <t4028>He had shown it to so many people that I got the impression that this photo seemed more real to him than the house itself.</t4028>
<t4029>“Jimmy sent this to me.</t4029> <t4030>Isn't it a beautiful photo?</t4030> <t4031>It shows everything so clearly.</t4031><t4032>’”</t4032>
<t4033>“Really beautiful.</t4033> <t4034>Have you met recently?</t4034>
<t4035>“He visited me two years ago and bought me the house I am currently living in.</t4035> <t4036>When he left the house, our relationship was understandably strained; but now I can see that there was a reason for it.</t4036> <t4037>He had already realized back then that he had a bright future ahead of him!</t4037> <t4038>Even after becoming successful, he always treated me generously.</t4038><t4039>”</t4039>
<t4040>He seemed reluctant to put the photograph away; for a while longer, he held it in front of my eyes as if to stall.</t4040> <t4041>After putting it back in his wallet, this time he took out an old book called Hopalong Cassidy from his pocket.</t4041>
<t4042>"Look at this, he never put it down when he was a child.</t4042> <t4043>It was clear even back then.</t4043><t4044>"</t4044>
<t4045>He opened the back cover and turned the book towards me so I could see; on the last blank page, it was written in handwriting: PROGRAM.</t4045> <t4046>The date September 12, 1906, was inscribed above it, and below it was a schedule:</t4046>

<t4082>“I found this book by chance,” said the old man, “it explains the situation very well, doesn't it?</t4082><t4083>”</t4083>
<t4084>“Yes.</t4084> <t4085>It explains.</t4085><t4086>”</t4086>
<t4087>“It was certain that Jimmy would advance in life.</t4087> <t4088>He always made decisions like this.</t4088> <t4089>Did you see what he did to improve himself?</t4089> <t4090>He always did that. Once, he told me I ate like a pig, and I beat him up.</t4090><t4091>”</t4091>
<t4092>He didn't seem very willing to close the book; after reading each item aloud, he would look at my face.</t4092> <t4093>I think he wanted me to memorize this list for my own use.</t4093>
<t4094>Before the three Protestant ministers called from Rushing arrived, I couldn't help but stand at the window and wait for other cars to come.</t4094> <t4095>Gatsby's father was doing the same thing.</t4095> <t4096>Time passed.</t4096> <t4097>When the servants began to gather in the hall and wait, Mr. Gatz started blinking his eyes and talking about the rain in a sorrowful voice, not really knowing what to say.</t4097> <t4098>He was also frequently checking his watch.</t4098> <t4099>I pulled him aside and asked him to wait another half hour.</t4099> <t4100>However, it was of no use.</t4100> <t4101>No one had come.</t4101>
<t4102>At around five in the evening, our procession of three cars reached the cemetery gate and stopped under a light drizzle.</t4102> <t4103>In the front was the pitch-black and wet hearse, behind it was the limousine with Mr. Gatz, the priest, and me, and a little behind us was Gatsby's station wagon with five or six drenched servants and the West Egg postman.</t4103> <t4104>As we passed through the main gate and walked towards the cemetery, I heard a car stop and then someone splashing through puddles behind us.</t4104> <t4105>When I turned around, I recognized the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had seen admiring the books in Gatsby's library about three months ago.</t4105>
<t4106>I hadn't seen him since that night.</t4106> <t4107>I didn't know how or where he learned about the funeral, nor did I even know his name.</t4107> <t4108>Rainwater was flowing down his glasses; he took them off and wiped them to see the tarpaulin spread over Gatsby's grave.</t4108> <t4109>I was trying to think of Gatsby, but he was now far away.</t4109> <t4110>Though I wasn't offended, my mind was stuck on the fact that Daisy hadn't sent any news or even a flower.</t4110> <t4111>I heard someone in the distance murmur, 'Blessed are the dead who are touched by rain,' and the man with owl-eyed glasses responded boldly, "Amen!"</t4111>
<t4112>As I left the crowd and ran towards the soaking wet cars, the owl-eyed one came up to me.</t4112> <t4113>"I couldn't come home," he said.</t4113>
<t4114>"In fact, no one could come.</t4114><t4115>"</t4115>
<t4116>“Come on!” he said in astonishment, “Oh my God, hundreds wouldn't come out of that house.</t4116><t4117>” He took off his glasses again and cleaned them, this time both inside and outside.</t4117> <t4118>“Poor rascal!” he said.</t4118>
<t4119>One of my most vivid memories is my return to the West during Christmas time, first when I was in the preparatory class of the university, and later during my faculty years.</t4119> <t4120>Those of us who were going beyond Chicago would gather at six o'clock on a December evening at the old and dark Union Station, hurriedly bidding farewell to our Chicagoan friends who had already embraced the holiday spirit.</t4120>
<t4121>I will never forget the girls from Miss so-and-so’s school, wrapped in their furs, chatting away with steam coming from their mouths, eagerly waving their frostbitten hands when they ran into an acquaintance, calling out from one place to another, “Are you going to the Ordways?</t4121> <t4122>To the Herseys? To the Schuttzes?” and those long, green tickets we held tightly in our gloved hands.</t4122> <t4123>When the dirty yellow carriages of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St.</t4123> <t4124>Paul line pulled into the station, we would cheer up as if the Christmas festivities had begun.</t4124>
<t4125>When the train moved and plunged into the winter nights, the real snow, that is, our snow, would start to stretch out on either side of us and stain the windows. As the feeble lights of the Wisconsin stations appeared and disappeared, the surroundings would suddenly take on a sharp and wild atmosphere.</t4125> <t4126>While returning to our seats from the dining car, in the cold passages between the cars we passed through, we would inhale this air into our lungs and deeply feel our connection with this country, at least for this strange hour-long period, before melting back into it and disappearing.</t4126>
<t4127>This was my Midwest; not wheat fields, prairies, and dilapidated Swedish villages, but my youthful, excited train rides home, the street lamps in the frosty darkness, the jingling sounds of sleds, and the shadows cast by holly Christmas wreaths on the windows illuminated by lights.</t4127> <t4128>I am a part of these, with a bit of the weight given by those long winter nights upon me, and a sense of contentment from having grown up in the Carraway house in a town where homes are known by the family names of those who have lived in them for decades.</t4128> <t4129>Today, I understand that all these things I have described are actually the story of the West: Tom and Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan, and I; we were all Westerners, and perhaps we shared a common flaw that secretly prevented us from fully adapting to the life of the East.</t4129>
<t4130>Even on the days that excited me the most; even when I was acutely aware of the superiority of the East compared to those boring, expanding, and sprawling cities beyond Ohio, with their endless interrogations spared only for small children and the elderly, the East always seemed somewhat skewed to me.</t4130> <t4131>Especially West Egg, which adorned my most incredible dreams.</t4131> <t4132>I liken this place, with its hundred traditional yet grotesque houses crouching under a low, sullen sky and a dull, lackluster moon, to a night scene painted by El Greco.</t4132> <t4133>In the foreground, four serious men, dressed in tailcoats, walk with a stretcher in their hands, on which a woman in a white dress lies drunk.</t4133> <t4134>The hand dangling from the stretcher sparkles with jewelry.</t4134> <t4135>The men leave the woman at a house with a serious demeanor, but no one knows her name, nor do they care that they have left her at the wrong address.</t4135>
<t4136>After Gatsby's death, the East seemed haunted to me, distorted beyond my ability to correct with my eyes.</t4136> <t4137>Therefore, as blue smoke rose from the dried leaves and the wind stiffened the laundry on the lines, I decided to go home.</t4137>
<t4138>There was one more thing I had to do before leaving, maybe it would be better to leave it as it is; an unpleasant, disagreeable thing.</t4138><t4139>Still, I wanted to set everything right before leaving, I couldn't just rely on the ready and indifferent sea to clean up my remnants.</t4139><t4140>So I went to see Jordan Baker.</t4140><t4141>We talked about what had happened to us first, and then what had happened to me; she had just sat there in a big chair, listening to me with an extremely calm demeanor.</t4141><t4142>She was in her golf clothes; I remember thinking she looked like a beautiful painting with her proudly raised chin, hair the color of autumn leaves, and sunburned skin that matched the color of the golf glove she held in her lap.</t4142><t4143>When I finished telling her everything, without making any comments, she simply said she was engaged to someone.</t4143><t4144>Even though I knew she had many suitors she could marry immediately if she approved, I didn't really believe what she said.</t4144><t4145>Still, of course, I didn't neglect to pretend to be surprised.</t4145><t4146>For a moment, I seemed to hesitate about whether I was doing the right thing, but when I thought it over again, I quickly pulled myself together.</t4146><t4147>When I stood up to say goodbye, she suddenly said, "Still, you brushed me off."</t4147><t4148>"That's exactly what you did on the phone.</t4148><t4149>I don't care about you anymore, but it was a very new experience for me, so I felt dazed for a while.</t4149><t4150>"</t4150>
<t4151>We shook hands.</t4151>
<t4152>“Do you remember?” he asked, “We had a conversation about driving.</t4152><t4153>”</t4153>
<t4154>“Actually, I don't remember exactly.</t4154><t4155>”</t4155>
<t4156>“You said a bad driver is only safe until he meets another bad driver.</t4156> <t4157>Well, I finally met another bad driver, didn't I?</t4157> <t4158>So the reason I couldn't predict it correctly was my own carelessness.</t4158> <t4159>I thought you were honest and straightforward and took pride in it.</t4159><t4160>”</t4160>
<t4161>“I am thirty,” I said, “I am five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.</t4161><t4162>”</t4162>
<t4163>He did not respond.</t4163> <t4164>I was angry at him, still a little in love, and very sad.</t4164> <t4165>I turned my back and walked away.</t4165>
<t4166>At the end of October, one evening I ran into Tom Buchanan.</t4166> <t4167>On Fifth Avenue, with his usual aggressive demeanor, walking ahead of me with his hands slightly forward as if ready to fight anyone who crossed his path, moving his head side to side to match his restless scanning eyes.</t4167> <t4168>While I slowed down to avoid catching up to him, he stopped and began to frown at a jeweler's display window.</t4168> <t4169>Then he saw me, came over, and extended his hand.</t4169>
<t4170>“What's the matter, Nick? Aren't you going to shake my hand?</t4170><t4171>”</t4171>
<t4172>“Yes.</t4172> <t4173>You know what I think about it.</t4173><t4174>”</t4174>
<t4175>“You are crazy,” he said immediately, “Completely insane.</t4175> <t4176>I don't understand what your problem is.</t4176><t4177>”</t4177>
<t4178>"Tom," I said, "what did you tell Wilson that day?</t4178><t4179>"</t4179>
<t4180>He looked without saying a single word!</t4180> <t4181>I had realized that I was right in my assumptions about what happened during those lost hours.</t4181> <t4182>I turned to leave, but he came up from behind and grabbed my arm, "I told him the truth, Nick!" he said, "We were about to set off when he showed up; I instructed the servant to say we weren't home but the man forced his way in and went upstairs, he was so furious that if I hadn't told him who owned that car, he might have killed me.</t4182> <t4183>During the entire time he stayed, his hand was on the gun in his pocket."</t4183> <t4184>Then he challenged defiantly.</t4184> <t4185>"So what if I told him?</t4185> <t4186>That scoundrel deserved what happened to him; he had blinded both Daisy and you, but in reality, he was just a thug.</t4186> <t4187>As if running over Myrtle like a dog wasn't enough, he didn't even look back!</t4187><t4188>"</t4188>
<t4189>I didn't say anything except that it wasn't true.</t4189>
<t4190>“Do you think I wasn't upset?</t4190> <t4191>Look, when I went to clear out that apartment, I sat down and cried like a child when I saw the dog biscuit on the shelf.</t4191> <t4192>God, it was awful...</t4192><t4193>”</t4193>
<t4194>I didn't like him at all and I was never going to forgive him.</t4194> <t4195>However, I saw that he found himself completely justified for what he did.</t4195> <t4196>Everything was chaotic and reckless; Tom and Daisy were extremely reckless, smashing up everything and everyone around them, then retreating into their money or their carelessness, or whatever it was that held them together, leaving others to clean up their mess.</t4196>
<t4197>This time I shook the hand he extended.</t4197> <t4198>Refusing was pointless, at that moment I felt like I was shaking a child's hand.</t4198> <t4199>Tom entered the jeweler's to buy a pearl necklace or perhaps a pair of cufflinks, and thus, he was forever freed from my provincial sensitivity.</t4199>
<t4200>As I was leaving West Egg, Gatsby's house was still empty.</t4200> <t4201>The grass in his garden had grown as tall as mine.</t4201> <t4202>A taxi driver in town wouldn't pass by here for even a minute without stopping and showing the inside.</t4202> <t4203>Maybe he was the one who took Daisy and Gatsby to East Egg on the night of the accident; who knows, maybe he had made up a story about the event.</t4203> <t4204>I didn't want to hear any of it, so I avoided getting into his car when I got off the train.</t4204>
<t4205>Since I couldn't get Gatsby's dazzling and enchanting parties out of my mind, I spent Saturday nights in New York, downtown; I could still hear the music, the endless faint laughter spilling out from his garden, and the cars coming and going on the road in front of his house.</t4205> <t4206>One night, I actually heard a car passing by, saw its headlights illuminating the steps in front of the door, but I didn't inquire who it was.</t4206> <t4207>Perhaps it was the last guest, unaware that the party had ended, as they had been on the other side of the world for some time.</t4207>
<t4208>On my last day there, after selling my car to the grocer and stuffing my suitcase to the brim, I went at night to see the misfortune that was inconsistent with the size of the house.</t4208> <t4209>On the white marble steps, written in tile by a child, I saw an unspeakable word that could be clearly read even in the pale light of the moon.</t4209> <t4210>I erased the writing by scraping my shoe sole against the stone with a squeak.</t4210> <t4211>Then I went down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.</t4211>
<t4212>Since most of the large places on the shore had closed, I could see nothing except for the faint light of a ferry crossing the Bosphorus.</t4212> <t4213>As the moon rose, those unnecessary buildings melted away one by one, and I understood how this view might have appeared to the first Dutch sailors who arrived here: it was the fresh and verdant bosom of a brand new world.</t4213> <t4214>On the road to Gatsby's house, the now non-existent trees had once whispered and satisfied man's greatest and ultimate dreams.</t4214> <t4215>When mankind set foot on this continent, he must have held his breath at that magical moment, forced to turn towards that aesthetic feeling he did not understand and perhaps did not even want, and for the last time in history, faced something that satisfied his curiosity.</t4215>
<t4216>While thinking about that old, mysterious world, I thought of the amazement Gatsby must have felt when he first noticed that green light at the end of Daisy's dock.</t4216> <t4217>He had probably come a long way to reach his mansion rising over this blue lawn and thought he had come close enough to his dream to touch it.</t4217> <t4218>At that moment, he was unaware that this dream had already receded far behind, somewhere in the vast unknown where the dark lands of the country stretched out beyond the city in the endless night.</t4218>
<t4219>Gatsby believed in the green light.</t4219> <t4220>In the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.</t4220> <t4221>It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther…</t4221> <t4222>And one fine morning…</t4222>
<t4223>While we row against the current and struggle with the waters, aren't we actually continuously moving backward, that is, towards the past?</t4223>
