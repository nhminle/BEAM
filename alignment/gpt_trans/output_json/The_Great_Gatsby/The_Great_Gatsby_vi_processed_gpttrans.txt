<t0>Chapter 1</t0>
<t1>During the years when I was young and easily influenced, my father gave me some advice, and it was this advice that changed my thinking from that moment on.</t1>
<t2>"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone, just remember that not everyone in this world has had the advantages that you've had." My father said.</t2>
<t3>My father didn't say much more, but because there was always a subtle way of communicating between us, I understood that his words contained much deeper meanings.</t3><t4>As a result, that advice made me inclined to be cautious in all my judgments, helping me to see and understand the strange natures of those around me, but at the same time, it also made me a victim of not a few who came to bother and annoy me.</t4><t5>The characteristic I just mentioned, if manifested in an ordinary person, would quickly attract abnormal minds to them.</t5><t6>Therefore, when I was still studying at university, I was often unfairly labeled as a political merchant, because I knew many sad, private, and secret stories of people, even the stories of libertine men I didn't know.</t6><t7>It's not that I went out of my way to seek out the private matters of others.</t7><t8>I often had to pretend to sleep, pretend to be busy, or act indifferent and unfriendly when I noticed clear signs that a private matter was about to be revealed.</t8><t9>In fact, the confessions of young men, or at least the words they used to express themselves, were often just borrowed ideas and phrases from others that they had edited and trimmed, making their thoughts no longer coherent or clear.</t9><t10>Being cautious in judgment is actually about constantly nurturing hope.</t10><t11>I was always afraid that if I forgot to do so, I would miss out on many things, just like the things my father proudly pointed out and I also proudly repeated, which is that the basic awareness of polite conduct is not always equally distributed to everyone at birth.</t11>
<t12>After boasting about my patience like that, I must also confess that my patience for enduring has its limits.</t12> <t13>Human conduct can be built on solid rock or on a swampy foundation, but at some point, I no longer care what it was built on.</t13> <t14>Last autumn, when I returned home from the East, I felt that I wanted the whole world to wear uniforms and to forever stand in ranks with moral uprightness.</t14> <t15>I no longer wanted noisy, boisterous entertainments with the privilege of glimpsing into people's hearts.</t15> <t16>Only Gatsby, the person whose name I used for this book, was an exception to my reaction.</t16> <t17>Gatsby represented everything I scorned.</t17> <t18>If human nature is a series of successful expressions, then he was indeed admirable.</t18> <t19>With a heightened sensitivity that could perceive the future, he was like a complex machine capable of recording earthquakes from thousands of miles away.</t19> <t20>This sensitivity of his had nothing to do with the weak, sentimental sensitivity respected under the term "creative temperament."</t20> <t21>It was merely a rare gift for hope, a romantic readiness that I have never found in anyone else and probably never will.</t21> <t22>In the end, Gatsby was good, and it was precisely what tormented and haunted Gatsby, the filthy dust that floated above his awakened dreams, that temporarily closed my interest in the sorrows and short-lived joys of people.</t22>
<t23>Through three generations, my family has been a reputable and affluent family in this Midwestern city.</t23> <t24>The Carraway lineage lived like a clan; according to tradition, we are descendants of the Duke of Buccleuch.</t24> <t25>However, to be precise, the founder of our branch was my grandfather's brother.</t25> <t26>He came here in 1851, then sent a substitute to fulfill his duty in the Civil War, and established a wholesale business in metal mechanical tools that my father has inherited and managed up to this day.</t26>
<t27>I have never seen the face of this great-uncle, but I believe I resemble him, based on the stern face in the portrait hanging in my father's room.</t27> <t28>I graduated from Yale University in New Haven in 1915, exactly a quarter of a century after my father.</t28> <t29>After that, I joined the fight against the German immigrants, known to everyone as the First World War.</t29> <t30>I participated in the counterattack so zealously that when I returned home, I was still quite restless.</t30>
<t31>The Midwest is no longer the most exciting center of the world for me; it now seems to have become a tattered edge of the universe.</t31> <t32>Therefore, I decided to go to the East to learn about stocks and financial securities.</t32> <t33>Everyone I knew was in this industry, so I thought the market could still support another single young man like me.</t33> <t34>All my aunts and uncles discussed this matter as if they were choosing a preparatory school for me.</t34> <t35>Finally, they declared "Alright" with serious and hesitant faces.</t35> <t36>My father agreed to support me for a year.</t36> <t37>After various delays, I finally arrived in the East in the spring of 1922, thinking I would stay there forever.</t37>
<t38>If I were to look for a room to rent in the city, it would probably be more practical and convenient for me.</t38> <t39>However, since it was the warm season at that time, and I had just left an area with vast grasslands and plenty of trees, when a young colleague suggested that the two of us rent a house in the suburbs, I immediately thought it was a good idea.</t39> <t40>My colleague found a house, a weather-beaten wooden bungalow, for eighty dollars a month.</t40> <t41>But in the end, the company transferred him to Washington, and so I had to move to the suburbs alone.</t41> <t42>I had a dog - at least it stayed with me for a few days before it ran away - an old Dodge car, and a Finnish maid. Her daily tasks were to help me make the bed, cook breakfast, and mutter Finnish proverbs to herself by the electric stove.</t42>
<t43>I felt lonely and lost for about a day or so, until one morning when a man who had just moved into the area behind me stopped me on the road.</t43>
<t44>"Could you please show me the way to West Egg village?" This person asked, bewildered.</t44>
<t45>I gave him directions, and as I continued walking, I no longer felt lonely; I had become a guide, a pathfinder, a pioneer.</t45> <t46>This man, by chance, made me feel comfortable with the area I lived in.</t46>
<t47>And then, under the rosy sunlight and the explosive sprouting of new buds on the trees, everything around grew rapidly like in a time-lapse film, it reminded me of a common reasoning, that life will start anew when summer comes.</t47>
<t48>There are too many books to read and so much abundant health to be enjoyed from fresh, youthful air.</t48> <t49>I bought about a dozen sets of books on banking, credit, and stock investment.</t49> <t50>The sets of books with red and gold-plated covers stood upright on the shelf, looking like freshly minted coins, promising to reveal the excellent secrets known only to Midas, Morgan, and Maecenas.</t50> <t51>I intend to read many more books.</t51> <t52>When I was in college, I really liked literature.</t52> <t53>One year, I wrote a series of coherent and serious editorials for the Yale News school newspaper.</t53> <t54>Now I will bring all that experience back into my life and once again become the rarest of experts, a well-rounded person.</t54> <t55>This is not a sarcastic statement - ultimately, life becomes easier to understand when we observe it from just one window.</t55>
<t56>It was truly an opportunity that led me to rent a house in one of the most peculiar places in North America. It is a long, narrow, and rich island stretching eastward from New York.</t56> <t57>Among the other rare and strange sights there are two strips of land with peculiar shapes.</t57> <t58>They are about twenty miles away from the city, looking like a pair of giant eggs, identical in shape and separated by a long strip of water, elegantly called a strait.</t58> <t59>The two eggs protrude, encroaching into the most tamed saltwater area in the Western Hemisphere, the Long Island Sound, a vast wet livestock farm.</t59> <t60>These two strips of land are not entirely oval.</t60> <t61>Like the egg in Columbus's anecdote, both are flattened at the end where they connect to the mainland.</t61> <t62>The similarity in shape is the reason why the seagulls flying overhead are constantly confused.</t62> <t63>However, for other wingless creatures, the magical allure here lies in the complete difference of everything between the two strips of land, except for shape and size.</t63>
<t64>My house is in West Egg - comparing the two eggs, this side is less luxurious, however, this is just a common saying to describe the peculiar difference between the two places, it is not a malicious comparison.</t64> <t65>My house is right at the sharp tip of the egg, only about fifty yards from the strait, wedged between two massive houses whose rental prices range from twelve to fifteen thousand dollars each vacation season.</t65> <t66>The house to the right of mine is a gigantic architectural structure by any standard.</t66> <t67>It was built based on the architecture of some town hall in Normandy, France. The house is still new, nestled under sparse ivy vines, it includes a tower built on the side, a marble swimming pool, and over forty acres of lawns and gardens.</t67> <t68>That is Gatsby's mansion.</t68> <t69>More precisely, since I had not yet met Gatsby, it was the massive mansion residence of a nobleman by that name.</t69> <t70>My house next door became an eyesore, but only a small one because no one really paid attention to it.</t70> <t71>Therefore, I got to enjoy the sea view, a part of the neighbor's lawn, and the comfort of living near millionaires while only paying eighty dollars a month.</t71>
<t72>On the other side of the bay are the white castles of the luxurious East Egg village, resplendently lining the coast.</t72> <t73>The historic summer truly began one afternoon when I drove over there to have dinner with Tom Buchanan and his wife.</t73> <t74>Daisy was my distant cousin, and Tom I had known since college.</t74> <t75>When the war had just ended, I had stayed with them for two days in Chicago.</t75>
<t76>In addition to many different physical achievements, Tom, Daisy's husband, was once one of the strongest rugby players in New Haven. He was also considered a player of national stature, who, when at his peak at the age of twenty-one, reached such heights that everything he achieved afterward could never compare.</t76> <t77>Tom's family was extremely wealthy, and even during his college years, Tom's extravagant spending habits drew much criticism.</t77> <t78>Now, although Tom has left Chicago to live in the East, his lifestyle still leaves people in awe, such as how he brought an entire herd of polo ponies from Lake Forest.</t78> <t79>It is hard to imagine that a young man born in the same</t79>
<t80>the generation like mine that has become wealthy enough to spend at that level.</t80>
<t81>I don't know the reason why they moved to live in the East. They once lived in France for a year for no reason at all.</t81> <t82>After that, they kept drifting from place to place, living anywhere as long as there were polo players and wealthy people gathering.</t82> <t83>This time they would settle down here permanently, Daisy told me so over the phone, but I didn't believe it.</t83> <t84>I couldn't see through Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would always wander, always yearning to find the emotional excitement of the polo matches of the past that he could never find again.</t84>
<t85>Then, on a warm and windy afternoon, I drove to East Egg to visit two old friends whom I hardly understood.</t85> <t86>Their house was built more elaborately and intricately than I had imagined.</t86> <t87>It was a mansion designed in the Georgian colonial style, painted in cheerful red and white, facing the entire bay.</t87> <t88>The lawn, nearly a quarter mile long, started from the sea and stretched all the way to the front door, cutting through sundials, brick paths, and vibrant gardens, finally, when it reached the house, it seemed to be on a run, climbing up the side and turning into bright vines.</t88> <t89>The facade of the house was adorned with a row of tall, wide glass windows.</t89> <t90>These golden doors were now shining brightly from the reflected sunlight and were wide open to welcome the hot, windy afternoon.</t90> <t91>In his riding outfit, Tom Buchanan was standing with legs apart on the porch.</t91>
<t92>Tom had changed since his school years in New Haven. He was now a robust thirty-year-old man, with straw-colored hair, a stern mouth, and a disdainful demeanor.</t92> <t93>His bright eyes, full of arrogance, gave his face an overwhelming look and gave Tom an aggressive posture, thrusting forward.</t93> <t94>Even the elegant display through his riding outfit could not hide the immense strength of his body.</t94> <t95>His legs, tightly pressing against his shiny boots, looked as if they might burst the laces at the top, and one could see the rippling muscles moving each time his shoulders shifted beneath the thin coat.</t95> <t96>This was a body capable of tremendous strength, a brutal body.</t96>
<t97>Tom's high-pitched, hoarse voice further accentuated the gruffness in his manner of speaking.</t97> <t98>Adding to that was his condescending attitude.</t98>
<t99>Even with those he liked, when he was still in school in New Haven, there was no shortage of people who bitterly hated Tom.</t99>
<t100>"Don't assume that my opinion on these matters is already decided," When Tom said that, it seemed like he meant "Just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you."</t100> <t101>The two of us were in the senior student association at school together, although we were never close, I always had the feeling that he liked me and wanted me to like him back in his rough and rebellious way.</t101>
<t102>We stood chatting with each other for a few minutes on the sunlit porch.</t102>
<t103>"I found this place to be amazing." Tom said, his eyes full of ostentatiousness, constantly moving.</t103>
<t104>Tom used one hand to turn me around, then extended his broad hand forward to show off.</t104> <t105>Following the sweep of his hand, I saw an Italian-style sunken garden, half an acre of intensely fragrant roses, and a motorboat with a raised bow bobbing on the offshore waves.</t105>
<t106>"This house used to belong to Demain, the king of wealth." Tom turned me around once more, politely but abruptly.</t106> <t107>"Let's go inside."</t107>
<t108>We walked through a tall corridor into a room of bright pink, with both ends of the room elegantly connected to the house by glass windows.</t108> <t109>These windows were slightly open, their white frames sparkling in contrast to the fresh green grass outside, which seemed to be trying to grow into the room.</t109> <t110>A gentle breeze blew through the room, lifting the curtains like flags, twisting them and then inflating them against the ceiling decorated like wedding cake frosting, before continuing to ripple across the wine-colored carpet, creating waves on its surface like the wind on the sea.</t110>
<t111>The only thing that remained stationary in the room was the enormous long chair with two young women sitting on it, looking as if they were floating on a balloon tethered below.</t111> <t112>Both were wearing white dresses, their clothes billowing as if they had just been blown back to their original spot after a short flight around the house.</t112> <t113>I must have stood there quietly for a moment, listening to the flapping sound of the curtains and the creaking groan of the picture hanging on the wall.</t113> <t114>A loud bang occurred when Tom closed the side window, and the wind ceased entirely, along with the curtains, the rugs, and the balloon containing the two young women slowly descended to the ground.</t114>
<t115>Of the two people, I was not acquainted with the younger woman.</t115> <t116>She lay stretched out at one end of the bench, completely motionless, her chin slightly raised as if trying to balance something on it that was about to fall.</t116> <t117>In fact, whether she saw me through the corner of her eye or not, I couldn't tell, because she didn't show any expression at all.</t117> <t118>I was so surprised that I almost mumbled an apology for my presence disturbing them.</t118>
<t119>The second person, Daisy, at least made an effort to sit up.</t119> <t120>She leaned slightly forward with a cautious expression, then let out a small, charmingly ridiculous laugh.</t120> <t121>I laughed along and then stepped into the room.</t121>
<t122>"I was so happy that I was completely stunned," Daisy laughed again as if she had just said something very witty.</t122> <t123>Daisy held my hand for a moment, then looked up at my face as if to assure me that she didn't wish to meet anyone more than me; Daisy's manner has always been like that.</t123> <t124>She whispered to introduce me to the girl performing the balancing act, whose last name was Baker.</t124> <t125>(I heard rumors that Daisy often whispered just to make people lean closer to her.</t125> <t126>Such an unjust criticism did not diminish her charm).</t126>
<t127>Baker's lips began to move.</t127> <t128>She nodded to me, so slightly that it was barely noticeable, then quickly tilted her head back as before.</t128> <t129>The object that Baker was balancing seemed about to fall, making her anxious.</t129> <t130>Once again, I almost blurted out words that sounded like an apology.</t130>
<t131>I turned back to look at Daisy as my cousin began to ask questions in a deep, resonant voice.</t131> <t132>It was the kind of voice that made the listener's ears follow its rise and fall, as if each word was an arrangement of musical notes that would never be played again.</t132> <t133>Daisy's face bore a beautiful melancholy, containing radiant brightness - those were her sparkling bright eyes and her passionately charming mouth.</t133> <t134>However, the most captivating thing about Daisy was her voice, which held a liveliness that made it very difficult for the men who loved her to forget: for instance, the melodious pleading, the whisper "listen to me," the earnest recounting that she had just experienced joyful moments and that even more joy was coming within the next hour.</t134>
<t135>I told Daisy about how on my way through the East I had stopped by Chicago, and how about a dozen people had sent their regards to Daisy.</t135>
<t136>"Do they really miss me?" Daisy exclaimed in ecstasy.</t136>
<t137>"The entire city was in mourning.</t137> <t138>All the cars had their left rear wheel painted black to symbolize a mourning wreath, and there were continuous sounds of lamentation throughout the night along the northern shore of the lake."</t138>
<t139>"Great! Let's go back there, Tom.</t139> <t140>Tomorrow!"</t140>
<t141>Then Daisy added something that had nothing to do with the ongoing conversation.</t141>
<t142>"Do you want to meet my child?"</t142>
<t143>"I really want to."</t143>
<t144>"The little girl has fallen asleep."</t144> <t145>"She is three years old."</t145> <t146>"You have never met her, have you?"</t146>
<t147>"Never."</t147>
<t148>"Then you should meet her.</t148> <t149>The girl..."</t149>
<t150>Tom Buchanan had been pacing back and forth in the room, now he stopped and placed his hand on my shoulder.</t150>
<t151>"Nick, what are you doing for a living now?"</t151>
<t152>"I issue credit bonds"</t152>
<t153>"With which company?"</t153>
<t154>I give the answer.</t154>
<t155>"I've never heard of these companies." Tom replied decisively.</t155> <t156>This way of speaking annoyed me.</t156> <t157>I responded curtly.</t157>
<t158>"You would know if you stayed in the East."</t158>
<t159>"Oh, don't worry, I will definitely stay in the East." Tom said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, seemingly wary of other reactions.</t159> <t160>"I would be foolish to go anywhere else."</t160>
<t161>At that moment, Baker spoke up, "Of course!" This sudden statement startled me.</t161> <t162>These were the first words she had uttered since I entered the room.</t162> <t163>Clearly, this surprised Baker herself just as much as it did me.</t163> <t164>She yawned and stood up after a series of graceful, swift movements.</t164>
<t165>"My body is completely numb, I've been lying here for who knows how long." Baker complained.</t165>
<t166>"Don't blame me, I tried my best to persuade you to go to New York all afternoon." Daisy retorted.</t166>
<t167>"No, thank you. I don't drink." Baker declined as four cocktails were just brought up from the dining room.</t167> <t168>"I'm in training."</t168>
<t169>The homeowner looked at Baker skeptically. "Really?" Then Tom drained his glass of wine as if there was only a drop left at the bottom.</t169>
<t170>"I don't know how you manage to get everything done."</t170>
<t171>I looked at Baker, wondering what she could possibly do.</t171> <t172>I liked watching Baker. She had a slender body, small breasts, and a straight posture.</t172> <t173>Baker tried to accentuate her figure even more by pushing her shoulders back like a cadet.</t173> <t174>Her eyes had a less bright look due to sun fatigue on a charming but weary and irritable face.</t174> <t175>Baker politely returned my gaze with a curious look of her own.</t175> <t176>I realized that I had seen her or her picture somewhere before.</t176>
<t177>"You live in West Egg, right? I know a few people there."</t177> <t178>Baker asked disdainfully.</t178>
<t179>"I don't know anyone."</t179>
<t180>"You must know Gatsby."</t180>
<t181>"Gatsby?"</t181> <t182>"Which Gatsby?" Daisy asked insistently.</t182>
<t183>Before I had a chance to reply that the person was my neighbor, everyone was informed that dinner was ready.</t183> <t184>Extending his stiff arm to grip mine tightly, Tom Buchanan pushed me out of the room as if moving a chess piece from one square to another.</t184>
<t185>Leisurely, slowly, with their hands lightly resting on their hips, two young women led the way ahead of us, stepping out onto the pink-painted porch facing the evening sunset.</t185> <t186>On the table, four candles had been lit, flickering gently in the light breeze.</t186>
<t187>"Why light the candles?" Daisy frowned in protest and then snapped her fingers to extinguish them. "In two weeks, it will be the longest day of the year.</t187> <t188>Does everyone look forward to the longest day of the year but then let it pass by unnoticed?</t188> <t189>I always wait for the longest day of the year but then let it slip away." Daisy looked at us with a bright, radiant face.</t189>
<t190>"We should organize to do something." Baker yawned, sitting at the table in a manner that resembled preparing to lie down on a bed.</t190>
<t191>"That's right."</t191> <t192>"What should we organize?" Daisy said, turning to ask me.</t192> <t193>"What do people usually organize?"</t193>
<t194>Before I could answer, Daisy's eyes were fixed on her little finger with a look of horror.</t194>
<t195>"Look, my finger hurts." Daisy complained.</t195>
<t196>We all turned to look, the knuckles were already bruised.</t196>
<t197>"You did that, Tom," Daisy blamed.</t197> <t198>"I know you didn't mean to, but it was you who caused it."</t198> <t199>"That's the price I have to pay for marrying a brute of a man, a hulking specimen."</t199>
<t200>Sometimes both Daisy and Baker would speak at the same time with sarcastic remarks, not disturbing anyone, not chattering but calm and cool like the clothes they were wearing and like their empty eyes devoid of desire.</t200> <t201>The two young women sat there, accepting the presence of Tom and me, trying politely to make conversation to entertain us or to entertain themselves.</t201> <t202>Both knew that dinner would eventually end, and soon the afternoon would pass by as well.</t202> <t203>Life here was completely different from life in the West, where afternoons always rushed from one stage to another until ending in a predictable disappointment or in complete terror of the present moment.</t203>
<t204>"Daisy, you make me feel like an uncivilized person." I confided</t204>
<t205>regret after drinking the second glass of red wine with a strong cork smell.</t205> <t206>"Can you talk about the fields, the harvest, or any other topic?"</t206>
<t207>I have no hidden meaning in this statement, but it was received differently.</t207> <t208>Tom exclaimed fiercely.</t208>
<t209>"Civilization will shatter into pieces, I truly feel pessimistic about this matter."</t209> <t210>"Have you read the book 'The Rise of the Colored Empires' written by some Mr. Goddard?"</t210>
<t211>"Not yet, so what?" I replied, feeling surprised by Tom's tone.</t211>
<t212>"It is a good book that everyone should read.</t212> <t213>The idea of the book is that if we are not careful, the white race will be completely submerged.</t213>
<t214>Those opinions are completely scientific and have been proven."</t214>
<t215>"Tom is becoming more and more erudite." Daisy said with a not very deeply sad expression.</t215> <t216>"He reads profound books full of long words.</t216> <t217>Do you remember that word we..."</t217>
<t218>"Actually, these books are all science books." Tom insisted, glancing at his wife impatiently.</t218> <t219>"This author has researched everything carefully.</t219> <t220>Everything is now in our hands as the dominant race, we need to keep an eye on other races, otherwise, they will rise up and take control of everything."</t220>
<t221>"We have to defeat them." Daisy whispered, glaring fiercely towards the scorching sun.</t221>
<t222>"You two should live in California." Baker spoke up, but Tom interrupted her by turning heavily in his chair.</t222>
<t223>"The author puts forth the idea that we are Nordic people.</t223> <t224>I, you, she, and..." After a brief moment of hesitation, he included Daisy in the list with a slight nod, causing Daisy to wink at me once again.</t224> <t225>"And it is we who have created all the things that make up civilization, from science to art and everything else.</t225> <t226>Do you agree?"</t226>
<t227>There was something truly pitiable in the way Tom strained his mind, as if Tom's self-satisfaction, now even higher than before, still wasn't enough to help him think.</t227> <t228>Just at that moment, the telephone rang inside the house, and the butler left the porch to go inside.</t228> <t229>Daisy took advantage of this interruption to lean towards me and speak.</t229>
<t230>"I will reveal to you a family secret." Daisy whispered eagerly.</t230> <t231>"The story about the butler's nose.</t231> <t232>Do you want to hear the story about the butler's nose?"</t232>
<t233>"Well, I came here precisely because I wanted to hear that story."</t233>
<t234>"In fact, he was not a butler before, but worked as a silver polisher for someone who had a shop with about two hundred customers in New York. He had to polish silver from morning until night until his nose got poisoned."</t234>
<t235>"The illness is getting worse and worse." Baker continued the suggestion.</t235>
<t236>"That's right.</t236> <t237>It kept getting worse until he eventually had to quit what he was doing."</t237>
<t238>In a moment, the last drop of sunlight romantically fell on Daisy's radiant face. Her voice made me lean forward and hold my breath just to hear it.</t238> <t239>Then this radiance gradually faded as each drop of sunlight took turns to bid farewell regretfully, like children having to stop playing and leave the joy-filled street at twilight.</t239>
<t240>The butler returned and whispered something into Tom's ear. Upon hearing it, Tom frowned, pushed his chair back, stood up, and went inside without saying a word.</t240> <t241>Tom's absence quickly gave Daisy an opportunity; she leaned forward once more, her voice radiant and melodious.</t241>
<t242>"Nick, I really like you coming here to have a meal with me.</t242> <t243>You remind me of a rose, a pure rose.</t243> <t244>Isn't that right?" Daisy turned to Baker waiting for confirmation. "Isn't it a pure rose?"</t244>
<t245>This is not true.</t245> <t246>I am not even a little bit like a rose.</t246> <t247>Daisy was really just speaking on a whim, yet the warm breath emanating from her body seemed as if her heart was trying to reveal itself to the listener by hiding under words that carried no breath, transmitting out to touch the hearts of others.</t247> <t248>Then, suddenly Daisy threw her napkin onto the table, apologized to everyone, and went inside the house.</t248>
<t249>Baker and I exchanged a quick glance, deliberately not revealing any ideas.</t249> <t250>As I was about to speak, Baker swiftly stood up and said "Shh" in a cautious tone.</t250> <t251>The murmured conversations, trying to be kept low, could be heard from the next room.</t251> <t252>Without any shame, Baker leaned forward to try to listen.</t252> <t253>The murmuring grew louder, almost understandable, then lowered again, then rose to an animated level, and finally fell completely silent.</t253>
<t254>"Mr. Gatsby, whom you mentioned, is my neighbor.." I prompted.</t254>
<t255>"Don't speak.</t255> <t256>I want to listen to see what's going on."</t256>
<t257>"Is something happening?" I asked innocently.</t257>
<t258>"You really don't know? I thought everyone knew already." Baker said with genuine surprise.</t258>
<t259>"I didn't know anything at all."</t259>
<t260>"Really..." Baker hesitated, "Tom has another woman in New York."</t260>
<t261>"Is there another woman?" I repeated in a daze</t261>
<t262>Baker nodded</t262>
<t263>"If she were a considerate person, she shouldn't call Tom right in the middle of dinner like that.</t263> <t264>Don't you think so?"</t264>
<t265>Before I could grasp the meaning of Baker's words, I heard the rustling of a dress and the sound of shoes scraping; both Tom and Daisy had returned to the dining table.</t265>
<t266>"I can't resist!" Daisy said loudly with an unnaturally cheerful voice.</t266>
<t267>Daisy sat down, after glancing at Baker and then at me, she continued speaking.</t267> <t268>"I just went outside for a minute, the scenery is truly poetic.</t268> <t269>There was a bird perched on the lawn that I guessed was a lark that had followed the Cunard or Starline ship here.</t269> <t270>The bird was flying and singing.." Daisy's voice was melodious.</t270> <t271>"Isn't it romantic, Tom?"</t271>
<t272>"It's so romantic." Tom replied, then turned to me miserably. "After dinner, if it's still light out, I want to take you down to the stables."</t272>
<t273>The phone in the house rang again, startling everyone.</t273> <t274>While Daisy looked at Tom and shook her head resolutely, the topic of the stables, or rather all topics, vanished into thin air.</t274> <t275>In that five-minute interruption, I remembered that the candles on the table had been relit, lost and meaningless.</t275> <t276>I had the urge to look directly at each person's face but avoided looking into anyone's eyes.</t276> <t277>I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but I believed that even Baker, who seemed very skilled at suspicion, could completely dismiss the shrill, urgent call of this fifth guest from his mind.</t277> <t278>Depending on one's temperament, this situation might amuse some people. But with my instincts, I would immediately call the police.</t278>
<t279>Needless to say, the horses were, of course, no longer mentioned.</t279> <t280>A few steps apart in the twilight, Tom and Baker leisurely walked into the library, as if to guard a flesh-and-blood corpse.</t280> <t281>As for me, I tried to appear interesting and slightly feigned deafness, following Daisy across the veranda that extended to the front porch.</t281> <t282>In the thick darkness, we sat down next to each other on the wicker chair.</t282>
<t283>Daisy placed her hands on her face as if to feel its graceful and beautiful contours.</t283> <t284>Her eyes slowly gazed into the velvety twilight.</t284> <t285>I saw that she was overwhelmed with emotions, so I asked a few questions about the girl to help her calm down.</t285>
<t286>"Nick, although we are cousins, we actually don't understand each other very well." Daisy suddenly said.</t286> <t287>"You didn't attend my wedding."</t287>
<t288>"At that time, there was still war, and you hadn't returned from the battle."</t288>
<t289>"That's right." Daisy hesitated.</t289> <t290>"Actually, I went through a painful time.</t290> <t291>Now I'm bitter about everything."</t291>
<t292>Of course, Daisy had a reason to think that way.</t292> <t293>I waited for Daisy to continue, but she didn't say anything more.</t293> <t294>After a while, I timidly turned back to bring up the topic of the little girl.</t294>
<t295>"I guess your daughter can already talk, eat, and do many things."</t295>
<t296>"Yes, that's right." Daisy looked dazed. "Listen, Nick.</t296> <t297>Let me tell you what I said when my daughter was just born.</t297> <t298>Do you want to hear it?"</t298>
<t299>"I really want to listen."</t299>
<t300>"After listening, you will know why I have the perspective on life that I do now.</t300> <t301>The story goes like this: the baby was born less than an hour when Tom disappeared to who knows where, only God knows where he was.</t301> <t302>After the anesthesia wore off, I woke up with the feeling of being abandoned.</t302> <t303>I immediately asked the nurse whether the newborn was a boy or a girl.</t303> <t304>The nurse replied that my child was a girl, and upon hearing that, I turned away, unable to hold back my tears.</t304> <t305>I said, "That's fine, I'm glad it's a girl.</t305> <t306>I hope she will become a foolish girl.</t306> <t307>In this world, the best thing for a girl is to become a beautiful fool."</t307>
<t308>"You see, I think everything in the world is terrible." Daisy continued with a determined voice.</t308> <t309>"Everyone thinks so, even the most progressive people.</t309> <t310>I really know it.</t310> <t311>I've been everywhere, seen everything, and done everything." Daisy's eyes flashed with a challenging look, glancing around like Tom's eyes, then Daisy burst into a mocking, emotional laugh.</t311> <t312>"Wise and sophisticated, oh my, I'm so wise and sophisticated."</t312>
<t313>Right after Daisy's voice stopped compelling me to listen and believe, I began to realize the insincerity in what she had just said.</t313> <t314>It made me feel uncomfortable, as if the entire afternoon had been a joke aimed at exploiting my feelings to contribute to that game.</t314> <t315>I waited, and sure enough, in just a moment Daisy looked at me again with a smug smile on her beautiful face, as if she had confirmed her status in an exclusive elite society of which she and Tom were members.</t315>
<t316>Inside the house, the crimson room was illuminated under the light.</t316>
<t317>Tom and Baker each sat at one end of the long bench, with Baker reading the news from the Saturday Evening Post to Tom in a monotonous murmur, the words blending together to form a sound like a caress</t317>
<t318>to soothe.</t318> <t319>The light shone on Tom's boots, dulled on Bakey's pale yellow hair, and reflected a sparkle along the page as Baker turned it with slender, slightly trembling arms.</t319>
<t320>When the two of us walked in, Baker raised his hand to signal us to keep quiet.</t320>
<t321>"To be continued, please read the next issue." Baker finally said, throwing the magazine onto the table</t321>
<t322>Baker shook his knee to adjust his posture, then stood up straight.</t322>
<t323>"It's ten o'clock already, a well-behaved girl should go to bed at this hour." Baker said, his demeanor resembling someone checking the time on the ceiling.</t323>
<t324>"Jordan will compete tomorrow in Westchester," Daisy explained.</t324>
<t325>"Oh, so you are Jordan Baker."</t325>
<t326>Now I understand why her face looks so familiar.</t326> <t327>That adorable disdainful expression had once looked straight at me from photographs published in sports newspapers in cities like Asheville, Hot Springs, and Palm Beach.</t327> <t328>I had also heard rumors about her, all critical comments about something not very pleasant, but what it was, I had completely forgotten.</t328>
<t329>"Good night.</t329> <t330>Remember to wake me up at eight o'clock tomorrow morning." Baker said softly.</t330>
<t331>"If you can wake up, then I will do it too."</t331>
<t332>"You can get up."</t332> <t333>"Good night, Mr. Carraway. Hope to see you again soon."</t333>
<t334>"You will definitely have a chance to meet again." Daisy confirmed. "Actually, I will arrange a matchmaking for you two."</t334> <t335>"Nick, you should come here often and I will set you two up, like accidentally locking you both in a closet and then pushing it onto a ship heading out to sea, you know, tricks like that."</t335>
<t336>"Good night, you won't hear anything." Baker called down from the stairs.</t336>
<t337>"She is a cute girl.</t337> <t338>People shouldn't let her wander around like that," Tom said after a while.</t338>
<t339>"Who shouldn't do that?" Daisy asked coldly.</t339>
<t340>"It's her family."</t340>
<t341>"Baker only has one aunt who is about a thousand years old as a relative.</t341> <t342>But Nick will take care of her, won't you Nick?</t342> <t343>This summer Baker will be here many weekends with us.</t343> <t344>I think the family atmosphere will have a good influence on Baker."</t344>
<t345>Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.</t345>
<t346>"Does she live in New York?" I asked quickly.</t346>
<t347>"From Louisville.</t347> <t348>In our innocent and pure youth, we grew up there.</t348> <t349>The time of fresh purity..."</t349>
<t350>"You've been confiding a lot with Nick on the porch, haven't you?" Tom suddenly interrogated.</t350>
<t351>"Is that so?" Daisy looked at me.</t351> <t352>"I don't remember clearly, but I think we talked about the Nordic people.</t352> <t353>Yes, I definitely remember we talked about that.</t353> <t354>It was just the way the conversation flowed, and then we realized..."</t354>
<t355>"Don't believe everything you hear, Nick." Tom advised me.</t355>
<t356>I gently replied that I hadn't heard anything at all.</t356> <t357>A few minutes later, I stood up to take my leave.</t357> <t358>The couple saw me off to the door, standing next to each other in the cheerful light.</t358> <t359>Just as I started the car, Daisy called me back. "Wait a moment."</t359>
<t360>"Wait a minute, I forgot to ask you something important.</t360> <t361>We heard that you got engaged to a young woman in the West."</t361>
<t362>"That's right." Tom chimed in with a friendly tone.</t362> <t363>"We heard that you got engaged."</t363>
<t364>"That's just slander.</t364> <t365>I'm too poor."</t365>
<t366>"But we really did hear it that way." Daisy insisted.</t366> <t367>I was surprised to see Daisy talking and laughing again like a flower.</t367> <t368>"We heard it from three people, so it must be true."</t368>
<t369>Of course, I understand what they are implying, but I have never been engaged, even ambiguously.</t369> <t370>In fact, those rumors had spread to the church announcements and were one of the reasons I moved to the East.</t370> <t371>One cannot avoid interacting with a long-time friend just because of rumors.</t371> <t372>On the other hand, I have no intention of marrying that person just to make the rumors come true.</t372>
<t373>The concern of Tom and his wife moved me and shortened the distance of their wealth from me.</t373> <t374>Anyway, when they left, I still felt confused, mixed, with a bit of indignation.</t374> <t375>To me, it seemed like what Daisy should do now was to quickly run out of the house with her child in her arms.</t375> <t376>But in Daisy's mind, that idea didn't seem to exist.</t376> <t377>As for Tom, the fact that he truly "had another woman in New York" was perhaps less surprising than him being bored after reading a book.</t377> <t378>Something had caused Tom to chew on old, boring ideas, as if his pride in his strong physique was no longer enough to sustain his decisive heart.</t378>
<t379>Summer had long arrived on the roofs of eateries and in front of roadside repair shops, where brand-new red gas pumps stood tall in pools of bright, all-encompassing light.</t379> <t380>When I got home to West Egg, I parked the car and sat for a moment on the abandoned lawn mower in the yard.</t380> <t381>The wind had stopped blowing, leaving a bright moonlit night with the sound of birds' wings flapping against the tree leaves and the incessant croaking of frogs, whose life force was being inflated by the earth's breath.</t381> <t382>There was the shimmering shadow of a cat slinking across the moonlight, and as I turned my head to follow the cat, I realized I was not alone.</t382> <t383>About fifty yards away from me, a figure had just emerged from the dark shadow of the neighboring mansion.</t383> <t384>He was standing with his hands in his pockets, gazing at the stars scattered like silver dust across the sky.</t384> <t385>There was something leisurely and relaxed in his demeanor and the way he firmly planted his feet on the lawn that made me realize he was Gatsby.</t385> <t386>He was coming out to affirm which of the properties between our residences belonged to him.</t386>
<t387>I intended to call Gatsby.</t387> <t388>Baker had mentioned him during the afternoon, so that was enough of an introduction.</t388> <t389>However, I did not call, because I saw Gatsby suddenly appear as if he wanted to be alone.</t389> <t390>Gatsby stretched his arms out towards the dark water in front of him, looking curious.</t390> <t391>From my distance, I could swear I saw him trembling.</t391> <t392>Unconsciously, I also looked towards the sea, but I saw nothing more than a small, distant green light, perhaps from the end of a dock.</t392> <t393>When I looked back again, Gatsby had disappeared, and I remained alone in the restless darkness.</t393>

<t403>Chapter 2</t403>
<t404>About halfway from West Egg to New York, the highway joins the railroad track and runs alongside it for a quarter of a mile to avoid passing through a desolate wasteland.</t404><t405>This valley is filled with ashes, a vast and unimaginable valley of ashes, where ashes spread out like wheat fields, piled into mounds, heaps, hills, and gardens of strange shapes.</t405><t406>The ashes here are piled high like houses with chimneys releasing smoke.</t406><t407>In the distance, the faint figures of men can be seen struggling to move in the dusty air.</t407><t408>Occasionally, a dismal gray train crawls slowly along the indistinct tracks, emitting eerie squealing sounds, and then comes to a complete stop.</t408><t409>Immediately, the dusty gray men swarm in with heavy shovels to dig, creating an impenetrable cloud of dust that obscures their work.</t409><t410>However, above the gray land and the ever-moving dust, if you look closely for a moment, you will see the eyes of Dr. T. J.</t410><t411>Eckleburg on a high billboard.</t411><t412>The eyes are enormous and blue, with pupils about a foot high.</t412><t413>The eyes do not look out from a face but from a pair of gigantic yellow spectacles resting on an indistinct nose.</t413><t414>Evidently, some mischievous oculist set up this billboard to attract clients to his practice in Queens, but then either went blind or moved away, leaving the eyes behind.</t414><t415>Yet, even though the eyes have faded due to the passage of time and weather without repainting, they still stand there, contemplating the wasteland where ashes from burnt refuse are stored.</t415>
<t416>Wrapping around the side of the ash valley is a river with murky, dirty water.</t416> <t417>When the iron bridge over the river is raised to let the barges pass, the passengers waiting on the train cars can witness the bleak scenery here for about half an hour.</t417> <t418>No matter what, vehicles are at least delayed there for a minute, so I had the chance to meet Tom Buchanan's mistress for the first time.</t418>
<t419>Everyone who knows Tom is aware of his affair.</t419> <t420>These people are very annoyed by the fact that he often takes his mistress to crowded, famous restaurants, then leaves her sitting alone at the table while he leisurely chats with acquaintances around.</t420> <t421>Although I was curious to see what this woman looked like, I wasn't particularly eager to meet her - but eventually, I did.</t421> <t422>One afternoon, I went to New York with Tom by train, and when the train stopped beside some ash heaps, Tom stood up, grabbed my elbow, and pulled me off the train.</t422>
<t423>"I'll get off here.</t423> <t424>I want you to meet my lover," Tom insisted.</t424>
<t425>I think Tom drank too much at the dinner</t425>
<t426>preferred because the way he was determined to make me follow was almost too aggressive.</t426> <t427>Tom arrogantly assumed that I had nothing worthwhile to do on a Sunday afternoon.</t427>
<t428>I followed Tom past a low whitewashed fence lying beside the railroad tracks.</t428> <t429>We walked back along the road about a hundred yards under the watchful gaze of Dr. Eckleburg. Looking around, we only saw a small yellow brick building on the edge of the wasteland.</t429> <t430>It looked like a miniature main street of a county town, with nothing else around it.</t430> <t431>One of the three shops in the row had a "For Rent" sign, the second was an all-night diner, accessible by a path covered in ashes.</t431> <t432>The remaining third shop was a garage, with a sign that read "Repair Shop - GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold." I followed Tom into the shop.</t432>
<t433>Inside, the shop looked poor and barren.</t433> <t434>The entire shop only had a dilapidated Ford car covered in dust, hidden dimly in the corner.</t434> <t435>I thought to myself that this shabby repair shop must be a front, and there would be luxurious, romantic rooms hidden upstairs.</t435> <t436>Just then, the shop owner appeared at the office door, wiping his hands on a rag.</t436> <t437>He was a blonde man, weak-looking, with pale skin, somewhat handsome.</t437> <t438>When he saw us, a flicker of damp hope appeared in his blue eyes.</t438>
<t439>"Hello, my friend Wilson, how's business these days?" Tom said, cheerfully patting the shop owner on the shoulder.</t439>
<t440>"There's nothing to complain about." Wilson replied with a somewhat unconvincing tone. "When will you sell me that car?"</t440>
<t441>"Next week, I am having someone repair it."</t441>
<t442>"Taking so long to fix, isn't it?"</t442>
<t443>"It's not like that."</t443> <t444>"If you feel that way, I can sell it to someone else."</t444>
<t445>"I didn't mean that at all." Wilson quickly explained. "What I meant was..."</t445>
<t446>Wilson's voice gradually faded as Tom anxiously glanced around the shop.</t446>
<t447>I heard footsteps coming down the stairs, and after a moment, I saw the figure of a full-figured woman blocking all the light from the office door.</t447> <t448>She was around thirty-five years old, full-figured, with round, alluring flesh.</t448> <t449>In a dark blue polka-dot crepe dress, her face had no features that could be called beautiful.</t449> <t450>However, one could immediately sense from this woman's body a vibrant energy radiating and a force continuously simmering.</t450> <t451>She smiled slowly, walked past her husband as if he wasn't there, shook hands with Tom, and looked directly into Tom's eyes in a flirtatious manner.</t451> <t452>Then she licked her lips, spoke to her husband in a soft but rude voice, without bothering to turn her head to look at him.</t452>
<t453>"Can you go get a few chairs so the guests can sit?"</t453>
<t454>"Sure." Wilson hurriedly obeyed, heading towards the small paper room, immediately blending into the cement color of the brick walls.</t454> <t455>A layer of white ash clung to the dark clothes he was wearing, and on his pale-colored hair, just like everything else in the shop that the ash was covering, except for his wife.</t455> <t456>She moved closer to Tom.</t456>
<t457>"I want to meet you, take the next train." Tom said firmly.</t457>
<t458>"Sure."</t458>
<t459>"I will meet you next to the newspaper stand on the lower floor of the station." The woman nodded and moved away from Tom as her husband George Wilson came out with two chairs from his office.</t459>
<t460>We waited for her at the end of the road, in a hidden spot where no one could see.</t460>
<t461>Only a few days left until the Independence Day on the Fourth of July, a pale and skinny Italian child is lining up fireworks along the railroad tracks.</t461>
<t462>"It really is a dreadful place, isn't it?" Tom said as he exchanged a grimace with Dr. Eckleburg.</t462>
<t463>"Terrible."</t463>
<t464>"Get her out of here for a while for the better."</t464>
<t465>"Her husband doesn't object?"</t465>
<t466>"Wilson, huh? He thinks his wife is visiting her sister in New York. He's so stupid, he doesn't even know if he's alive or not."</t466>
<t467>After that, Tom Buchanan, his mistress, and I went to New York together. Actually, we didn't travel together; Wilson's wife discreetly took a separate train car.</t467> <t468>Tom delayed traveling separately like that just to avoid the sensitivity of the people from East.</t468>
<t469>What if they happen to be on the same train?</t469>
<t470>Mrs. Wilson had changed into a tight-fitting muslin dress.</t470> <t471>The dress stretched tightly across her broad hips as Tom helped her down to the New York station platform. At the newsstand, she bought a Town Tattle tabloid and a movie magazine, then went to the drugstore to buy some face cream and a small bottle of perfume.</t471> <t472>When she reached the upper level of the station, she called for four taxis in a formal manner but rejected each one until she finally accepted the fifth because it looked new.</t472> <t473>The lavender-colored car, with gray upholstery, whisked us away from the crowded station into the bright sunshine.</t473>
<t474>However, at that moment, she suddenly turned her head away from the window and leaned forward to tap on the glass partition in front.</t474>
<t475>"I want to buy one of those dogs." Tom's girlfriend said earnestly.</t475>
<t476>"I want a dog for my apartment.</t476> <t477>It would be so cute to have a dog there."</t477>
<t478>We called the car to back up to an old man with white hair who bore an uncanny resemblance to John D. Rockefeller, with a basket hanging from his long neck containing about a dozen newborn puppies of indeterminate breed.</t478>
<t479>"What breed is this dog?" Wilson's wife asked anxiously as the old man approached the car door.</t479>
<t480>"We have all breeds."</t480> <t481>"Which breed would you like to buy, ma'am?"</t481>
<t482>"I want to buy the type of German Shepherd that police often keep, do you have any?"</t482>
<t483>The old man looked into the basket with a suspicious gaze, then reached in, grabbed the nape, and pulled up a wriggling one.</t483>
<t484>"That dog is not the type of German Shepherd that the police usually keep." Tom said.</t484>
<t485>"No, this one is not truly a German Shepherd." the old man said with a disappointed voice.</t485>
<t486>"It looks more like an Airedale terrier." The old man gently stroked the dog's back, which looked like a brown towel.</t486> <t487>"Just look at its fur.</t487> <t488>It's truly special fur.</t488> <t489>This breed will never bother you by catching a cold."</t489>
<t490>"I find it very cute." Wilson's wife said cheerfully. "How much does this one cost?"</t490>
<t491>"Is that the one?" The old man looked at the dog admiringly and said.</t491> <t492>"That dog costs ten dollars."</t492>
<t493>No one doubts that this dog has a bit of Airedale lineage, although its legs are strangely white.</t493> <t494>The dog was passed around and then placed on Mrs. Wilson's lap.</t494> <t495>She stroked its all-weather fur passionately.</t495>
<t496>"Is this dog a boy or a girl?" Mrs. Wilson asked tactfully and delicately.</t496>
<t497>"Is that the child? It's a boy."</t497>
<t498>"It is a female dog," Tom said decisively.</t498> <t499>"Here is your money.</t499> <t500>Take it to buy ten more dogs."</t500>
<t501>Our car reached Fifth Avenue, the weather was both warm and mild, reminiscent of a Sunday afternoon in the countryside, so much so that if I had seen a flock of white sheep at the corner of the street, I wouldn't have been surprised.</t501>
<t502>"Wait a moment, I have to say goodbye to the two people here." I said.</t502>
<t503>"That won't do." Tom quickly interrupted.</t503>
<t504>"Myrtle will feel slighted if you don't come upstairs, won't she Myrtle?"</t504>
<t505>"Come up and hang out for a bit," Myrtle, Tom's mistress, pleaded. "I'll call my sister Catherine.</t505> <t506>Everyone worth knowing says she's beautiful."</t506>
<t507>"Actually, I really want to, but..."</t507>
<t508>We continued to go further, crossing Park Street towards West Hundreds Street.</t508> <t509>At 158th Street, the taxi stopped in front of a building in a row of apartment houses, looking like a slice cut from a long white cream cake.</t509> <t510>Glancing around the neighborhood regally, Myrtle hugged her dog and gathered the newly purchased items, haughtily stepping into the house.</t510>
<t511>"I will invite the McKees up here," Myrtle declared as the elevator was going up. "And of course, I will also call my sister."</t511>
<t512>The apartment is located on the topmost floor, consisting of a small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom, and a bathroom.</t512> <t513>A set of sofas lined with rugs depicting large, cumbersome decorative scenes stretched from inside to the door, making the room feel cramped.</t513> <t514>As a result, everyone frequently tripped over the rug with scenes of girls swinging in the gardens of Versailles whenever they walked through the room.</t514> <t515>On the wall, there was only one oversized picture, depicting a hen standing on a vague rock.</t515> <t516>However, when viewed from a distance, the hen appeared to be a hat and the face of a plump old lady smiling down at the room.</t516> <t517>Several old issues of Town Tattle lay on the table along with a novel titled SIMON CALLED PETER and a few small tabloids specializing in digging up Broadway gossip.</t517> <t518>Upon entering the house, the first thing Myrtle did was take care of the dog.</t518>
<t519>The little boy guarding the elevator reluctantly went to buy a box of straw and some milk when asked.</t519> <t520>After buying them, he took it upon himself to buy an additional tin box of large, hard biscuits meant for dogs.</t520> <t521>A piece of biscuit left in the milk dish lay soaking indifferently throughout the entire evening.</t521> <t522>Tom unlocked the glass cabinet and took out a bottle of whiskey.</t522>
<t523>In my life, I have been drunk twice in total, and that afternoon was the second time.</t523> <t524>Everything that happened to me seemed very vague like it was covered in fog, even though it was already past eight o'clock and the room was still filled with bright sunlight.</t524> <t525>Sitting on Tom's lap, Wilson's wife was calling many people.</t525> <t526>When I realized there were no cigarettes, I went out to buy some at a corner drugstore.</t526> <t527>When I returned, the two of them had disappeared.</t527> <t528>I cautiously sat in the living room and read a chapter from the book Simon Called Peter.</t528> <t529>Either the book was terribly written, or the whiskey had distorted everything, I found that nothing written in the book made any sense.</t529>
<t530>When Tom and Myrtle reappeared, (after the first glass of wine, Mrs. Wilson and I had started calling each other by t</t530>
<t531>(term of endearment), the invited guests had also arrived at the door.</t531>
<t532>My sister Catherine is a slim, modern person, around thirty years old</t532>
<t533>age, her red hair tightly bunned, her face smeared with milk-white powder.</t533> <t534>Her eyebrows had been completely plucked and redrawn to appear more refined, but as the real hairs naturally grew back, they looked like two faint smudges on her face.</t534> <t535>As Catherine moved around, her numerous baked clay bracelets continuously shifted up and down, clinking together to create jingling sounds.</t535> <t536>She approached with the demeanor of a host, hurriedly glancing around as if she owned everything, giving me the impression that she resided here.</t536> <t537>However, when I asked her, Catherine laughed exaggeratedly, loudly repeating my question before answering that she was currently living with a girlfriend at a hotel.</t537>
<t538>The young man McKee, who lived downstairs, was pale and effeminate like a woman.</t538> <t539>He looked as if he had just shaved because there was still a streak of white shaving cream on his cheek.</t539> <t540>McKee politely greeted everyone in the room.</t540> <t541>He informed me that he was playing an "artistic game."</t541> <t542>It was only later that I learned he was a photographer, the author who had enlarged the blurry photo of Wilson's wife's mother, which now hung like a ghost on the wall.</t542> <t543>McKee's wife had a shrill voice, a lifeless demeanor, was pretentious, and quite terrifying.</t543> <t544>She proudly boasted to me that her husband had photographed her a total of one hundred and twenty-seven times since they got married.</t544>
<t545>Mrs. Wilson had changed into an elaborate evening dress made of cream-colored tulle, which emitted a constant rustling sound as she moved back and forth in the room.</t545> <t546>The dress had completely altered her demeanor.</t546> <t547>The vibrant energy from her body at the garage had now transformed into a distinctly haughty attitude.</t547> <t548>Her laughter, gestures, and words became increasingly fierce and aggressive.</t548> <t549>She dominated the space around her, making the room feel cramped.</t549> <t550>Then she even spun around like a creaking pillar in the hazy, smoke-filled air.</t550>
<t551>"Hey, sis." Mrs. Wilson loudly and whiningly said to her younger sister. "The people here always just want to deceive us.</t551> <t552>They only think about money.</t552> <t553>Last week, I called a woman up here to take care of my feet.</t553> <t554>When she handed me the bill, if you had seen it, you would have thought she had performed an appendectomy on me."</t554>
<t555>"What is that woman's name?" Mrs. McKee asked.</t555>
<t556>"Eberhardt."</t556> <t557>"She specializes in home foot care for clients."</t557>
<t558>"I like the dress you are wearing."</t558> <t559>"It's very cute," Mrs. McKee complimented.</t559>
<t560>Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrows disdainfully.</t560>
<t561>"It's just an old shirt."</t561> <t562>"I only put it on when I don't care about my appearance."</t562>
<t563>"But you look very beautiful in it, if you understand what I mean." Mrs. McKee continued to pursue the topic. "If Chester could take a picture of you in this pose, I think he would have a valuable piece."</t563>
<t564>All of us silently watched Mrs. Wilson; she brushed a lock of hair from her eyes and turned to look at us with a radiant smile.</t564> <t565>Mr. McKee tilted his head to one side, gazing at her intently, then slowly moved his hand back and forth in front of her face, measuring carefully.</t565> <t566>After a moment, he spoke.</t566>
<t567>"I should change the light."</t567> <t568>"I want to highlight her facial features and capture all the hair in the back."</t568>
<t569>"I don't think we should change the light." Mrs. McKee shouted. "I think it..."</t569>
<t570>The husband "shushed" the wife and we turned back to look at the model once more.</t570> <t571>At that moment</t571>
<t572>Tom Buchanan yawned loudly and stood up.</t572>
<t573>"Do you two, Mr. and Mrs. McKee, want something to drink?" Tom asked. "Myrtle, get some more ice and spring water here before everyone goes to bed."</t573>
<t574>"I sent the boy to get some ice." Myrtle raised her eyebrows in disappointment at the laziness of the subordinate.</t574> <t575>"These kinds of people!</t575> <t576>I always have to keep an eye on them all day long."</t576>
<t577>Myrtle looked at me and smiled for no reason, then hurried over to the dog, kissed it passionately, and then dragged her dress into the kitchen as if there were a dozen chefs waiting for her orders there.</t577>
<t578>"I captured some beautiful scenes in Long Island." McKee said.</t578>
<t579>Tom looked at him blankly.</t579>
<t580>"Two paintings have been framed and hung on the ground floor of the house."</t580>
<t581>"Which two letters?" Tom asked.</t581>
<t582>"Two contemplative pictures.</t582> <t583>One I named Montauk Point - Seagull. The other I named Montauk Point - The Sea."</t583>
<t584>Catherine sat down next to me on the long bench.</t584>
<t585>"Are you also in Long Island?" she asked.</t585>
<t586>"I live in West Egg."</t586>
<t587>"Really? I just attended a party there last month at the house of a man named Gatsby.</t587> <t588>Do you know him?"</t588>
<t589>"I am the neighbor right next to his house."</t589>
<t590>"Well, they say he is a grandson or some kind of cousin of the German Emperor Wilhelm.</t590> <t591>All his money comes from there."</t591>
<t592>"Really?"</t592>
<t593>She nodded.</t593>
<t594>"I am very afraid of him.</t594> <t595>I absolutely hate it when he touches me."</t595>
<t596>The intriguing news about my neighbor was interrupted when Mrs. McKee suddenly pointed at Catherine.</t596>
<t597>"Mr. Chester, I think you could take a few shots for her." She shouted loudly, but Mckee just nodded indifferently and then turned his attention to Tom.</t597>
<t598>"I want to take more pictures in Long Island, if I can get some help at the beginning.</t598> <t599>I just need help at the beginning."</t599>
<t600>"Ask Myrtle." Tom said, then burst out laughing as Mrs. Wilson walked in with a tray of drinks.</t600> <t601>"She'll give you a letter of recommendation, won't she Myrtle?"</t601>
<t602>"Doing what?" Myrtle asked, bewildered.</t602>
<t603>"I will give Mr. McKee a letter of introduction to my husband, so Mr. McKee can get a photography subject about my husband." Tom tried to find the words, his lips moving without making a sound, then he thought of it. "The subject is George B. Wilson at the gas station, or any subject with a similar name will do."</t603>
<t604>Catherine leaned towards me and whispered in my ear.</t604> <t605>"Neither of them can stand the person they married."</t605>
<t606>"They can't stand it</t606><t607>?"</t607>
<t608>"Can't stand it." She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom.</t608> <t609>"I mean, why do they keep living as husband and wife if they can't stand their spouse anymore?</t609> <t610>If I were them, I would have divorced and married each other right away."</t610>
<t611>"Didn't Myrtle also love Wilson?"</t611>
<t612>The answer to my question was unexpectedly provided by Myrtle.</t612> <t613>She eavesdropped on the question and answered it in a crude and vulgar manner.</t613>
<t614>"You see." Catherine exclaimed triumphantly, then lowered her voice again. "Actually, Tom's wife is the one blocking their way.</t614> <t615>She is a Catholic and does not believe in divorce."</t615>
<t616>Daisy is not a Christian.</t616> <t617>I felt a bit surprised by this embellished lie.</t617>
<t618>"When will they actually get married?" Catherine continued. "They will move to the West for a while, waiting for the storm to pass."</t618>
<t619>"Going to Europe might be more discreetly isolated."</t619>
<t620>"Oh, you like Europe?" She exclaimed in surprise.</t620> <t621>"I just returned from Monte Carlo."</t621>
<t622>"Is that so."</t622>
<t623>"Just last year."</t623> <t624>"I went there with a girlfriend."</t624>
<t625>"Have you been there long?"</t625>
<t626>"Not long, just to Monte Carlo and back."</t626> <t627>"We went via Marseilles."</t627> <t628>"When we left, we had more than twelve hundred, but within just two days, we were swindled and robbed of everything at the lodging houses."</t628> <t629>"You must know we were in a miserable state trying to find a way back."</t629> <t630>"Oh my God, I hate that city."</t630>
<t631>The late afternoon sky cast rays of sunlight through the window, for a moment resembling the blue honey color of the Mediterranean. The shrill voice of Mrs. McKee pulled me back to the present in the room.</t631>
<t632>"I almost made a mistake." She declared forcefully.</t632> <t633>"I almost married a lowly Jewish guy who had been pursuing me for many years.</t633> <t634>I knew that he was inferior to me.</t634> <t635>Everyone said: 'Lucille, that guy is way too inferior for you.'</t635> <t636>If I hadn't met Chester, I would have definitely married that guy."</t636>
<t637>"Yes, but listen here." Myrtle nodded her head and said.</t637> <t638>"At least I didn't marry that guy."</t638>
<t639>"That's right, I didn't take it."</t639>
<t640>"And I have married someone like that." Myrtle said, in a vague and unclear manner.</t640> <t641>"That is the difference between your case and mine."</t641>
<t642>"Why did you do that, Myrtle? No one forced you." Catherine questioned.</t642>
<t643>Myrtle thought for a moment, then finally answered.</t643>
<t644>"I married him because I thought he was a charming and elegant man.</t644> <t645>I believed he came from a noble family.</t645> <t646>But in reality, he isn't even worthy to lick my shoes."</t646>
<t647>"There was a time when she loved him madly." Catherine said.</t647>
<t648>"Madly in love with him!" Myrtle exclaimed incredulously.</t648> <t649>"Who said you were madly in love with him?</t649> <t650>You have never loved him as madly as you loved that other man."</t650>
<t651>Myrtle suddenly pointed at me, causing everyone to turn and look at me as if accusing.</t651> <t652>I tried to appear as though I had nothing to do with Myrtle's past.</t652>
<t653>"The only thing that could be considered crazy was that she married him.</t653> <t654>She immediately knew that she had made a mistake.</t654> <t655>He had borrowed the nicest suit to wear for the wedding but didn't tell her about it.</t655> <t656>A day later, when he wasn't home, a man came to retrieve the suit.</t656> <t657>She asked, 'Oh, so that suit belongs to you? This is the first time I've heard about this.'</t657> <t658>She returned the suit to the man, then collapsed on the bed and cried her heart out the entire afternoon."</t658>
<t659>"She should have left her husband right then." Catherine continued to tell me.</t659>
<t660>"The two of them have lived at that auto repair shop for eleven years already.</t660> <t661>Tom is the first lover she has ever had."</t661>
<t662>The second bottle of whiskey was continuously passed around for everyone to drink except Catherine, who felt "there's no need to drink to have fun."</t662> <t663>Tom rang the bell to call the servant and instructed him to buy the famous hamburgers for the afternoon meal.</t663> <t664>At that moment, I just wanted to leave this place to take a walk south towards the park under the gentle sunset.</t664> <t665>But every time I took a step to leave, I was pulled back, entangled in fierce debates like ropes tying me to the g</t665>
<t666>End.</t666> <t667>In the high space above the city where the golden windows we are in are located, we are certainly adding to the secret treasure of humanity, and to the pedestrian walking below on the slowly darkening streets.</t667> <t668>I saw him look up curiously.</t668> <t669>I felt as if I were both inside and outside, constantly both fascinated and disgusted by the unpredictable changes of life.</t669>
<t670>Myrtle pulled the chair closer to me, suddenly her hot breath wafted over me as she recounted the story of her first meeting with Tom.</t670>
<t671>"Only the last two narrow seats facing each other were left on the train."</t671>
<t672>I am on my way to New York to visit my sister and stay overnight there.</t672> <t673>Tom was wearing a suit and finely crafted leather shoes at that time.</t673> <t674>I couldn't take my eyes off him.</t674> <t675>But every time he looked back, I pretended to be reading the advertisements above his head.</t675> <t676>When the train stopped at the station, I found he was already beside me, his white shirt pressing tightly against my arm.</t676> <t677>I told him I would report him to the police, but he knew very well I was just pretending.</t677> <t678>I was so overwhelmed that when I got into the taxi with him, I didn't realize I hadn't taken the subway.</t678> <t679>At that moment, only one thought kept running through my mind.</t679> <t680>"Life is short, life is short."</t680>
<t681>Myrtle shouted to Mrs. McKee, her laughter echoing artificially throughout the room.</t681>
<t682>"Sister.</t682> <t683>I will give you this dress as soon as I no longer use it.</t683> <t684>Tomorrow I will buy a new one.</t684> <t685>I will make a list of everything I need to buy.</t685> <t686>A massager, a hair curler, a collar for the dog, a cute ashtray with a spring button, a wreath with a black silk ribbon to place on my mother's grave throughout the summer.</t686> <t687>I have to list everything so I don't forget what needs to be done."</t687>
<t688>Nine o'clock in the evening, and then just a moment later when I looked back, it was already ten o'clock.</t688> <t689>Mr. McKee was dozing off on the chair with his hand tightly gripping his thigh, resembling a picture of a man in a fighting stance.</t689>
<t690>I took a handkerchief to wipe off the dried shaving cream stuck on his cheek, which had been bothering me all afternoon.</t690>
<t691>The small dog sitting on the table is looking through the smoke with its bleary eyes, occasionally letting out indistinct whines.</t691> <t692>The people in the house disappear and then reappear, discussing where to go, getting lost, finding each other, and then finding each other again just a few steps away.</t692> <t693>At some point around midnight, Tom Buchanan and Myrtle stood facing each other, fiercely arguing whether Myrtle had the right to mention Daisy's name.</t693>
<t694>"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!" Myrtle shouted. "I'll call whenever I want.</t694> <t695>Daisy.</t695> <t696>Dai..."</t696>
<t697>With a deft movement, Tom Buchanan struck and broke Myrtle's nose.</t697>
<t698>Many blood-stained towels were thrown on the bathroom floor, the sound of women scolding, the intermittent groans of pain rising above the chaos.</t698>
<t699>The man Mckee suddenly woke up from his drowsy sleep, half-awake, and quickly headed towards the door.</t699> <t700>He got halfway there when he suddenly turned around and stared at the scene before him.</t700> <t701>His wife and Catherine were simultaneously scolding and comforting, stumbling from one place to another among the cramped furniture in the house to get bandages.</t701> <t702>A figure lay hopelessly on the sofa, blood streaming down, trying to spread the Town Tattle over the Versailles scene on the carpet to cover the blood.</t702> <t703>Mckee turned his back and continued to walk out the door.</t703> <t704>Reaching for the hat hanging on the ceiling lamp, I followed suit.</t704>
<t705>"Remember to come have lunch with us sometime." Mckee suggested as the creaky elevator carried the two of us down.</t705>
<t706>"Where?"</t706>
<t707>"Anywhere."</t707>
<t708>"Don't touch the lever." Little Thắng grumbled irritably while holding the elevator.</t708>
<t709>"Sorry." McKee said respectfully.</t709> <t710>"I didn't notice I had bumped into it."</t710>
<t711>"Alright, I will be happy to come." I accepted......</t711> <t712>Then..</t712> <t713>I stood beside McKee's bed, he was sitting between two bed sheets covering his underwear, holding a stack of many photographs, with names like: Beauty and the Beast...</t713> <t714>Loneliness...</t714> <t715>The Old Draft Horse...</t715> <t716>Brooklyn Bridge......</t716> <t717>Then..</t717> <t718>After that.</t718> <t719>I lay half-awake in the cold lower level of Pennsylvania Station, staring at the Morning Tribune, waiting for the four o'clock train.</t719>
<t720>Chapter 3</t720>
<t721>From my neighbor's house, the sound of music echoed without pause throughout the summer nights.</t721><t722>In Gatsby's azure garden, men and women flitted to and fro like moths, amidst whispered laughter, champagne glasses, and the stars in the sky.</t722><t723>Every afternoon, as the tide rose, I watched Gatsby's guests diving from the floating raft or sunbathing on the hot sand of the beach behind the house, while two motorboats cut through the waves, towing water skiers through the splashing foam.</t723><t724>On weekends, Gatsby's Rolls Royce transformed into a small bus, shuttling guests to and from the city from nine in the morning until past midnight, while his station wagon, like a yellow beetle, zipped back and forth to the train station to meet the arrivals.</t724><t725>Every Monday, eight servants, plus the gardener, armed with mops, brushes, hammers, and pruning shears, toiled all day to repair the damage from the night before.</t725>
<t726>Every Friday, five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York. Every Monday, these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves.</t726> <t727>There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb.</t727>
<t728>At least twice a week, a group of people from the catering company would come with hundreds of yards of canvas and many colored lights for decoration, enough to turn Gatsby's enormous garden into a Christmas tree.</t728> <t729>On the buffet tables, the food was lavishly displayed, including glossy appetizers, spiced baked hams nestled among layers of colorful lettuce leaves, puff pastry-wrapped sausages, and turkeys seemingly magically roasted to a golden hue.</t729> <t730>In the grand hall, a bar was set up with brass racks filled with various types of white wine, distilled spirits, and aperitifs.</t730> <t731>These bottles of wine were so aged that most of Gatsby's female guests were too young to distinguish one type of wine from another.</t731>
<t732>Around seven in the evening, the orchestra arrived.</t732> <t733>It wasn't the type of orchestra with just five instruments, but one that included an entire ensemble of oboes, trombones, saxophones, violins, cornets, piccolos, high drums, and low drums.</t733> <t734>The last swimmers had also left the beach to change clothes upstairs.</t734> <t735>Cars from New York were parked in five long rows in the yard.</t735> <t736>In the hallways, lounges, and porches, every place was filled with colors, hairstyles arranged in various strange styles, and Castile shawls that one could only dream of.</t736> <t737>The bar was extremely busy, with trays of cocktails being carried out, filling the garden outside, wave after wave until the air came alive with chatter, with boisterous laughter, with casual remarks, with introductions forgotten as soon as they were made, and with the enthusiastic encounters of women who had never known each other's names.</t737>
<t738>The colored lights further enhanced the radiance as the sun had set, at that moment the orchestra began to perform rhythmic music and the opera troupe's singing was raised to a higher note.</t738> <t739>With each passing minute, laughter became easier, flowing generously or bursting forth from cheerful remarks.</t739> <t740>The shapes of the groups of guests gathered also changed rapidly, swelling with new arrivals, or dispersing and reassembling within a single breath.</t740> <t741>Confident and bold young women wandered from place to place, weaving among other more voluptuous and less mobile girls to become the main centers of lively merriment.</t741> <t742>Then, still in the midst of the lively excitement, they continued to glide among the faces, voices, and ever-changing colors under the constantly shifting lights.</t742>
<t743>Suddenly, one of the girls in a shimmering translucent white dress moving around there grabbed a cocktail glass and downed it in one gulp to muster courage, then she started waving her hands like Frisco, dancing alone on the stage.</t743> <t744>In that moment, the atmosphere suddenly fell into silence, and the conductor hurriedly changed the orchestra's rhythm to match the girl's dance.</t744> <t745>The noise rose again as everyone whispered a false rumor, saying she was the stand-in for Gilda Gray in the Broadway Follies musicals.</t745> <t746>And thus, the gala began.</t746>
<t747>I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house, I was one of the few actual guests who were invited.</t747> <t748>The others who were not invited still came anyway.</t748>
<t749>They jumped into the cars that took them to Long Island, and after that, no one knew how they got to Gatsby's door.</t749> <t750>Once there, they were introduced by others who knew Gatsby.</t750> <t751>And just like that, they followed the host's principles and adapted to the behavior of those around them to participate in the festivities.</t751> <t752>Sometimes they came and went without ever meeting Gatsby; they just used their innocence as a ticket in.</t752>
<t753>I am</t753>
<t754>It was indeed true that I had been invited by Gatsby.</t754> <t755>Gatsby's chauffeur, in a robin's egg blue uniform, crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with an unexpected note from Gatsby.</t755> <t756>The note stated that Gatsby would be greatly honored if I would attend a small party at his house that evening.</t756> <t757>Gatsby had seen me many times before and had intended to invite me for a long time, but he had been hindered by special circumstances.</t757> <t758>Below the note was Gatsby's stately signature.</t758>
<t759>Around a little past seven in the evening, dressed in a white flannel suit, I stepped across Gatsby's lawn.</t759> <t760>After wandering around for a while, I felt a bit awkward amidst the moving wave of people around me whom I didn't know, although occasionally here and there I did recognize a few familiar faces of those who often rode the train with me.</t760>
<t761>I am amazed by the number of young English people scattered around.</t761> <t762>All of them are dressed elegantly, though they seem a bit gluttonous.</t762> <t763>They speak in a low voice, seriously and formally, with mature and wealthy Americans.</t763>
<t764>I am certain they are selling something, maybe stocks, insurance, or vehicles.</t764> <t765>They seem to be tormented by the realization of easy money within this campus and are convinced that with just a few well-placed words, those easy earnings will be theirs.</t765>
<t766>As soon as I arrived, I tried to find the host, but when I asked two or three people where Gatsby was, they just stared at me as if they were very surprised, then said they didn't know where Gatsby was.</t766> <t767>So I immediately wandered over to the cocktail table, the only place in the garden where a solitary young man could linger without looking aimless or lonely.</t767>
<t768>I was thinking of drinking myself into a stupor to ease my awkwardness and embarrassment when I suddenly saw Jordan Baker just stepping out from the house, standing at the top of the marble steps, looking down at the garden with her back slightly arched and an aloof demeanor.</t768>
<t769>Regardless of whether Jordan would welcome me warmly or not, I felt that I needed to stand with someone before initiating intimate conversations with strangers on my own.</t769>
<t770>"Hello, Miss!" I shouted, walking quickly towards Jordan.</t770> <t771>My voice was unusually loud, echoing across the garden.</t771>
<t772>"I thought you would definitely be here." Jordan said absentmindedly as I walked up.</t772> <t773>"I remember you live right next door to..." Jordan casually took my hand to signal that she would attend to me in a moment, then leaned in to listen to two girls in identical yellow dresses standing a few steps away.</t773>
<t774>"Hello, miss. Unfortunately, you did not win." Both girls greeted loudly.</t774>
<t775>They are talking about the golf tournament.</t775> <t776>Jordan lost in the final match the week before.</t776>
<t777>"Perhaps you don't know who we are, but we met you here about a month ago." One of the two girls in yellow said.</t777>
<t778>"Since that day, it seems the ladies have dyed their hair a different color." Jordan's comment left me astonished, but the two girls nonchalantly continued walking, as if Jordan's remark was meant for the early-rising moon or the dinner being laid out from the food basket by the catering staff.</t778> <t779>Jordan's slender golden arm rested lightly on mine, and we strolled down the steps, wandering leisurely through the garden.</t779> <t780>A tray of cocktails floated over to us under the dim lights, and then we sat down at the same table with the two girls in yellow dresses from earlier and three other men, each of whom introduced himself to us as Mr. Mumble.</t780>
<t781>"Do you often attend these parties?" Jordan asked the girl sitting next to him.</t781>
<t782>"The last time I came was when I met you." The girl replied in a lively voice.</t782> <t783>Then she turned to her companion, "You too, right Lucille?"</t783>
<t784>Lucille confirmed.</t784> <t785>She added.</t785>
<t786>"I like coming here.</t786> <t787>I never need to know what I will do, so I am always happy.</t787> <t788>Last time I was here, I tore my shirt on a chair.</t788> <t789>He asked for my name and address, and within a week, I received a package from Croirer’s shop with a brand new evening gown inside."</t789>
<t790>"Did you take that shirt?" Jordan asked.</t790>
<t791>"Of course, I will accept it.</t791> <t792>I was supposed to wear it tonight, but the chest area is too wide and needs to be adjusted to fit.</t792> <t793>The blue dress with beads costs two hundred and sixty-five dollars."</t793>
<t794>"There's something unusual about this guy that makes him do such a thing." The girl said eagerly. "It's like he doesn't want any trouble with anyone."</t794>
<t795>"Who doesn't want to?" I asked cautiously.</t795>
<t796>"Gatsby.</t796> <t797>Someone told me..."</t797>
<t798>The two girls and Jordan leaned in close to each other, appearing secretive.</t798>
<t799>"Someone told me they think you killed a man."</t799>
<t800>A shiver ran through all of us.</t800> <t801>Mr. Grumble leaned forward eagerly to listen.</t801>
<t802>"I don't think it's that serious." Lucille refuted skeptically.</t802> <t803>"He is more like a German spy during the war."</t803>
<t804>One of the men nodded in confirmation.</t804>
<t805>"I heard it again from someone who knows him well, who grew up with him in Germany." This man asserted confidently.</t805>
<t806>"Oh, no." The first girl said.</t806> <t807>"It can't be like that, because he was in the U.S. military during the war." Seeing that we were starting to believe what she was saying, the girl leaned forward excitedly and continued.</t807> <t808>"Occasionally observe him when he thinks no one is watching.</t808> <t809>I guarantee he has killed someone."</t809>
<t810>The girl squinted and shivered, Lucille also shivered.</t810> <t811>All of us turned to look around for Gatsby.</t811> <t812>This was as if to verify the fanciful rumors that Gatsby had inspired among those who loved to whisper about everything in the world.</t812>
<t813>The first dinner began, and there would be another one around midnight.</t813> <t814>Jordan invited me to sit at the table with the group she was with, who were sitting around a round table on the other side of the garden, consisting of three couples and a guy who was Jordan's date.</t814> <t815>He was an undergraduate student who frequently made bold insinuations, clearly under the impression that sooner or later, more or less, Jordan would offer herself to him.</t815>
<t816>Instead of engaging in lengthy conversations, this group of people all maintained a dignified demeanor, assuming for themselves the role of representing the noble and calm character of the East Egg residents to look after the West Egg residents.</t816> <t817>They were always cautious, not wanting to participate in the boisterous festivities.</t817>
<t818>After about half an hour of wasting time sitting there feeling out of place, Jordan whispered.</t818>
<t819>"Let's go.</t819> <t820>This place is too solemn, it doesn't suit me."</t820>
<t821>We stood up, and Jordan explained to everyone that we were going to find the host.</t821>
<t822>"I have never met him before." Jordan said, making me a bit embarrassed.</t822> <t823>The student nodded in a melancholic and gloomy manner.</t823>
<t824>First, we passed by the bar, which was very crowded, but Gatsby was not there.</t824> <t825>From the top steps, Jordan couldn't find Gatsby, nor did she see him outside on the porch.</t825> <t826>Then, by chance, we tried opening a door that looked peculiar, and subsequently entered a Gothic-style library, tall, with door frames made of intricately carved English oak, perhaps taken whole from some relic abroad.</t826>
<t827>A chubby middle-aged man, wearing large owl-shaped glasses, was sitting drunkenly on the edge of the table, staring blankly at the bookshelves.</t827> <t828>When the two of us walked in, he spun around with a look of interest, his eyes scanning Jordan from head to toe.</t828>
<t829>"What do you two think?" he asked eagerly.</t829>
<t830>"About what?"</t830>
<t831>He raised his hand and pointed to the bookshelves.</t831>
<t832>"About them.</t832> <t833>Truth be told, you two don't need to investigate to confirm it.</t833> <t834>I've already done it.</t834> <t835>They are all real."</t835>
<t836>"The books?"</t836>
<t837>He nodded.</t837>
<t838>"They are completely real books, with pages and everything.</t838> <t839>I thought they were just beautiful cardboard pieces that last long.</t839> <t840>In fact, they are entirely real books.</t840> <t841>With pages and..</t841> <t842>Here, let me show you both."</t842>
<t843>Convinced that we were still in doubt, he quickly walked to the bookshelf, then returned with the first volume of "Stoddard Lectures."</t843>
<t844>"See that." He exclaimed joyfully. "It is a real print.</t844> <t845>It really fooled me.</t845> <t846>This guy is truly a professional stage manager.</t846> <t847>So good.</t847>
<t848>It's so meticulous. Just like the real thing.</t848> <t849>Moreover, it even knows where to stop, without cutting the page.</t849> <t850>But what more can I ask for?</t850> <t851>What more can I hope for?</t851>
<t852>He snatched the book from my hand and hurriedly placed it back on the shelf, muttering that if one brick was taken out, the entire library could be at risk of collapsing.</t852>
<t853>"Who brought you here?" he asked.</t853> <t854>"Or did you come on your own? I was brought here by someone."</t854> <t855>"Most of the people here were brought."</t855>
<t856>Jordan looked at him with a lively, cheerful expression but did not respond.</t856>
<t857>"I was brought here by a lady named Roosevelt." He continued. "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt.</t857> <t858>Do you two know her?</t858> <t859>I met her somewhere last night.</t859> <t860>I've been drunk like this all week, I thought sitting in the study would sober me up."</t860>
<t861>"Is there?"</t861>
<t862>"I think it has improved a little bit.</t862> <t863>It's not certain yet, I've only been here for an hour.</t863>
<t864>I have told you two about the books, haven't I?</t864> <t865>They are all real books.</t865> <t866>They...</t866>
<t867>"He has already told us." Jordan and I solemnly shook his hand and then stepped outside.</t867>
<t868>Everyone was dancing on the tarps spread out in the garden, the old men were pushing the young girls in the opposite direction in endless, shameless, awkward spins.</t868> <t869>The better couples moved into the corners, guiding each other in stylish, proper dances.</t869> <t870>A large number of single girls danced alone or took over for the band, giving them a short break by playing the banjo or drums.</t870> <t871>Around midnight, the excitement increased. A</t871>
<t872>The renowned singer raised his high voice to sing a song in Italian, while a famous female singer with a deep voice sang Jazz music.</t872> <t873>Interspersed between the acts were acrobatic performances all over the garden, while joy and wild laughter continued to echo throughout the summer sky.</t873> <t874>A pair of twin actors, who turned out to be the two girls in yellow from earlier, performed a children's costume act.</t874> <t875>Champagne was now being served from wide-mouthed glasses resembling hand-washing bowls.</t875> <t876>The moon had risen higher.</t876> <t877>The silver triangular constellation of Libra floated above the water off the coast, gently trembling to the delicate, thin strains of music emanating from the banjos in the garden.</t877>
<t878>At that time, I was still beside Jordan Baker. We were sitting at the same table with a man around my age and a small, noisy girl who would burst into laughter at the slightest thing.</t878> <t879>Now I finally felt comfortable.</t879> <t880>I drank two large glasses of champagne, each as big as a bowl, and they made the scenes before my eyes transform into ones that were more meaningful, fundamental, and profoundly deep.</t880>
<t881>When the fun had died down, the man looked at me and smiled.</t881> <t882>He spoke politely.</t882>
<t883>"You look familiar.</t883> <t884>Were you in the third division during the war?"</t884>
<t885>"That's right."</t885> <t886>"I used to be in the Ninth Rifle Battalion."</t886>
<t887>"As for me, I was with the seventh infantry division until June 1918.</t887> <t888>I knew right away where I had met you."</t888>
<t889>We chatted for a while, reminiscing about the damp, gray villages in France.</t889>
<t890>Obviously, he is living around here because he told me that he just bought two seaplanes and will take them out for a test flight in the morning.</t890>
<t891>"Do you want to go with me, old friend?"</t891> <t892>"It's right near the beach along the strait."</t892>
<t893>"What time is it?"</t893>
<t894>"Any time that is convenient for you."</t894>
<t895>I was about to blurt out and ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled, asking me.</t895>
<t896>"It's more fun now, isn't it?"</t896>
<t897>"Feeling better now." After replying, I turned to the new acquaintance again. "The party here is a bit strange for me.</t897> <t898>I haven't met the host yet.</t898> <t899>I live in the house over there." I gestured towards the barely visible fence in the distance. "Then this guy Gatsby had his driver send me an invitation." The man looked at me for a moment as if he didn't understand what I was saying.</t899>
<t900>"I am Gatsby." He suddenly said.</t900>
<t901>"Really!" I was astonished. "I truly apologize."</t901>
<t902>"I thought you already knew, old friend.</t902> <t903>Unfortunately, I have not been a good host."</t903>
<t904>Gatsby smiled sympathetically, in fact, it was more than just sympathy.</t904> <t905>It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.</t905> <t906>It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.</t906> <t907>It understood you just as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.</t907> <t908>Precisely at that point, the smile vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.</t908> <t909>Before he introduced himself, I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.</t909>
<t910>As soon as Gatsby confirmed his identity, the butler hurried to his side, informing him that there was a phone call from Chicago.</t910> <t911>Gatsby excused himself with a slight nod to each of us.</t911>
<t912>"If you need anything, just call someone to get it, old sport," Gatsby encouraged me. "Sorry, I'll be right back."</t912>
<t913>After Gatsby had left, I immediately turned to Jordan, restraining myself from speaking about my surprise.</t913> <t914>I had thought Gatsby was a rosy, stout man in his middle age.</t914>
<t915>"Who is he?"</t915> <t916>"Do you know?" I asked.</t916>
<t917>"He is just a man named Gatsby."</t917>
<t918>"I asked him where he was from?</t918> <t919>What did he do?"</t919>
<t920>"Now it's you who starts the conversation first." Jordan replied with a weary smile. "Once he told me he had studied at Oxford." A vague and unclear past was beginning to take a clear shape behind Gatsby, but Jordan's next words made it fade away again.</t920>
<t921>"However, I do not believe."</t921>
<t922>"Why?"</t922>
<t923>"I don't know." Jordan asserted.</t923> <t924>"But I don't think he ever studied there."</t924>
<t925>There was something in Jordan's voice that made me think of the girl's earlier statement, "I think he killed someone," and it piqued my curiosity.</t925> <t926>Perhaps I would have accepted without a doubt if I had heard someone say Gatsby came from the swamps of Louisiana or the working-class East Side of New York. That would have been more understandable.</t926> <t927>The idea of young men drifting in from who knows where to buy a castle on the Long Island Sound seemed impossible, at least according to my provincial and inexperienced perspective; I didn't think they would do such a thing.</t927>
<t928>"Anyway, he often throws big parties." Jordan said, changing the subject with a city dweller's distaste for specifics.</t928> <t929>"I like big parties. At those, you can be discreet and no one pays attention.</t929> <t930>But at small parties, you don't get any privacy."</t930>
<t931>A drum roll thundered, and the voice of the orchestra conductor suddenly echoed throughout the garden.</t931>
<t932>"Ladies and gentlemen." He shouted. "At the request of Mr. Gatsby, we will be performing the latest work of Vladimir Tostoff, a piece that has garnered much attention at Carnegie Hall this past May."</t932> <t933>"If you have read the newspapers, you must know it was a major sensation." He smiled politely and cheerfully, adding, "a real sensation."</t933> <t934>Everyone burst out laughing.</t934>
<t935>"And that piece of music is called." He concluded with a strong, loud exclamation. "The History of the World in Jazz, by Vladimir Tostoff."</t935>
<t936>I had not yet had the chance to savor the essence of the music that Tostoff had composed because my eyes suddenly caught sight of Gatsby standing alone on the marble steps, looking from one group of people to another with a satisfied gaze.</t936> <t937>His sun-tanned skin was alluringly taut on his face, and his short-cropped hair looked as if it were meticulously trimmed every day.</t937> <t938>I did not see anything sinister in Gatsby.</t938> <t939>I wondered if Gatsby's abstinence from alcohol made him stand out among the guests.</t939> <t940>It seemed to me that the more lively the party became, the more composed and dignified Gatsby appeared.</t940> <t941>When the piece "The History of the World in Jazz" ended, the girls rested their heads affectionately on the shoulders of the boys like little puppies.</t941> <t942>The girls pretended to faint, falling backward into the arms of the boys or even into the crowd, knowing in their hearts that someone would catch them.</t942> <t943>Yet no one leaned into Gatsby, no short French bobbed hair rested on Gatsby's shoulder, and no quartet used Gatsby's head as a gathering point.</t943>
<t944>Gatsby's butler suddenly appeared beside us and spoke up.</t944>
<t945>"Are you Miss Baker? I'm sorry, Mr. Gatsby would like to have a private conversation with you."</t945>
<t946>"For me?" Jordan was surprised.</t946>
<t947>"Yes, ma'am, that's correct."</t947>
<t948>Jordan slowly stood up, raised an eyebrow at me in surprise, and then followed the butler into the house.</t948> <t949>I noticed that Jordan was wearing an evening gown.</t949> <t950>It seemed that all of Jordan's dresses had some similarities to sportswear; they all revealed a certain pride in her gait, as if the first time Jordan learned to walk was on a golf course on a fresh and clear morning.</t950>
<t951>I sat alone; it was around two in the morning.</t951> <t952>At some point, there were faint noises, almost evoking curiosity, coming from the long room with many windows overlooking the steps.</t952> <t953>The Jordanian student was chatting about obstetrics with two female singers from the choir, urging me to join him.</t953> <t954>I declined, avoiding them and going inside the house.</t954>
<t955>The large room was packed with people.</t955> <t956>One of the two girls in yellow was playing the piano, while a young woman from a famous choir band, tall with red hair, stood beside her singing.</t956> <t957>She had drunk too much champagne, so halfway through the song, she irrationally decided that everything had to become very sad.</t957> <t958>As a result, she not only sang but also cried.</t958> <t959>Whenever there was a pause in the song, she filled it with gasping breaths, sobbing, and then continued singing in a high, trembling voice.</t959> <t960>Tears rolled down her cheeks but did not fall freely; when they reached her heavily mascaraed eyelashes, they turned into ink, then slowly continued down as black streaks.</t960> <t961>Someone jokingly suggested she sing the notes written on her face, at which point she raised her hands to the sky, collapsed onto a chair, and fell asleep in a drunken stupor.</t961>
<t962>"She just had a quarrel with a man claiming to be her husband."</t962> <t963>The girl standing close to my elbow explained.</t963>
<t964>I looked around.</t964> <t965>Most of the remaining women were quarreling with the men who claimed to be their husbands.</t965> <t966>Even the group that came with Jordan, four people from East Egg, were also divided due to disagreements.</t966> <t967>One of those men was talking unusually attentively to a young actress, while his wife, despite trying to smile with dignity and indifference, could no longer hold back and tried to attack from the side.</t967> <t968>From time to time, she would suddenly appear beside her husband like a sparkling diamond, hissing into his ear, "You promised me."</t968>
<t969>Reluctance to go home is not limited to stubborn men.</t969>
<t970>In the hall at this moment, there were two men who were not drunk and their two wives who were full of indignation.</t970> <t971>The two wives loudly lamented their misfortune</t971>
<t972>harm each other.</t972>
<t973>"Whenever he sees me having fun, he wants to take me away."</t973>
<t974>"In my life, I have never heard of someone as selfish as that"</t974>
<t975>"We always have to be the ones to leave the earliest."</t975>
<t976>"Us too"</t976>
<t977>"Oh dear, tonight we are almost the last ones here." A husband said sheepishly.</t977> <t978>"The orchestra left half an hour ago too."</t978>
<t979>Although both wives agreed that such a heinous act was truly unbelievable, the quarrel ended with a brief scuffle, both wives were lifted up, their legs kicking wildly, and then carried off into the darkness.</t979>
<t980>While I was standing in the hall waiting to get my hat, the door to the study opened, and Jordan and Gatsby stepped out together.</t980> <t981>Gatsby said a few final words to Jordan, but his enthusiastic demeanor suddenly shifted to a more formal tone as several people approached to say their goodbyes.</t981>
<t982>Jordan's group called her eagerly from the porch, but she still lingered to shake hands.</t982>
<t983>"I just heard something incredibly surprising." Jordan whispered.</t983>
<t984>"How long have we been in there?"</t984>
<t985>"What?"</t985> <t986>"About an hour."</t986>
<t987>"This is truly astonishing." Jordan repeated absentmindedly.</t987> <t988>"But I swear I won't tell anyone to tease you." Jordan yawned gracefully right in my face. "When you have time, come visit me...</t988> <t989>The phone directory...</t989> <t990>Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard... my aunt..." Jordan said as she hurried out the door.</t990> <t991>Her rosy brown hand waved a quick goodbye and then blended into the group of people she was with at the door.</t991>
<t992>Feeling a bit embarrassed for staying too late on my first attendance, I joined the last guests of Gatsby standing around him.</t992> <t993>I wanted to let Gatsby know that I had been looking for him earlier in the evening to apologize for not recognizing him in the garden.</t993>
<t994>"There's nothing to worry about." Gatsby eagerly responded. "Don't think about it anymore, old sport." Gatsby's friendly face was as reassuring as his hand on my shoulder.</t994> <t995>"And don't forget we have an appointment to fly the seaplane together at nine o'clock tomorrow morning."</t995>
<t996>At that moment, the butler came up behind him: "Sir, there's a phone call from Philadelphia."</t996>
<t997>"Alright, wait a moment.</t997> <t998>Tell them I will listen right away....</t998> <t999>Good night"</t999>
<t1000>"Good night."</t1000>
<t1001>"Good night," Gatsby smiled.</t1001> <t1002>Suddenly I felt as if being one of the last people to leave was something special, as if it was what Gatsby had been longing for all evening.</t1002> <t1003>"Good night, old sport...</t1003> <t1004>Good night."</t1004>
<t1005>However, when I stepped down the stairs, I saw that the evening seemed not to be completely over yet.</t1005> <t1006>About fifty meters away from the door, there were about a dozen car lights illuminating a bizarre and noisy scene.</t1006> <t1007>A brand new two-seater car that had just left Gatsby's house less than two minutes ago was now stuck in a ditch by the roadside, with its right side lifted up, revealing a wheel that had been completely severed.</t1007> <t1008>The sudden protrusion of the wall was the cause of the broken wheel.</t1008> <t1009>This incident had piqued the curiosity of about half a dozen drivers, who stopped their cars and got out to look, blocking the entire road.</t1009> <t1010>The coarse shouting and the blaring horns from the cars stuck behind had been going on for quite a while, adding to the chaos of the scene.</t1010>
<t1011>A man in a long coat stepped out of the wrecked car and stood right in the middle of the road.</t1011> <t1012>He looked humorously and confusedly from the car to the wheel and then from the wheel to the people standing and watching.</t1012> <t1013>He explained.</t1013>
<t1014>"See that.</t1014> <t1015>It has fallen into the ditch."</t1015>
<t1016>It seemed like the event had caused him immense astonishment.</t1016> <t1017>At first, I noticed this unusual surprise, and then I recognized him as the guest who had been in Gatsby's library earlier.</t1017>
<t1018>"Why is it like that?"</t1018>
<t1019>"I don't know anything about machinery." He shrugged and said firmly.</t1019>
<t1020>"But why did it end up like this?</t1020> <t1021>Did you run into a wall</t1021><t1022>?"</t1022>
<t1023>"Don't ask me." The sharp-eyed man said, brushing off everything.</t1023> <t1024>"I don't really know how to drive, almost not at all.</t1024> <t1025>I just know that it was broken, that's all."</t1025>
<t1026>"If you are a bad driver, then you shouldn't try to drive at night."</t1026>
<t1027>"But I wasn't trying to drive." He explained indignantly, "I wasn't trying."</t1027>
<t1028>A terrifying silence enveloped those standing around.</t1028>
<t1029>"You are very lucky, it's just a tire.</t1029> <t1030>Being a bad driver and not even thinking about trying."</t1030>
<t1031>"You don't understand." The criminal explained.</t1031> <t1032>"I wasn't the one driving.</t1032> <t1033>There was someone else in the car."</t1033>
<t1034>The prolonged cries of "Aaaa..." expressed everyone's astonishment after hearing this explanation.</t1034> <t1035>Then the door of the two-seater car slowly opened.</t1035> <t1036>The crowd, now indeed a crowd, instinctively stepped back.</t1036> <t1037>Once the car door was fully open, it paused for a moment, looking eerie.</t1037> <t1038>Bit by bit, a person with a pale face slowly emerged from the car, staggering out, their large shoes hesitantly feeling the ground.</t1038>
<t1039>Dazzled by the car headlights and confused by the incessant blaring of car horns, the newly appeared figure staggered for a moment before recognizing the man in the long coat.</t1039>
<t1040>"What's the matter?</t1040> <t1041>Are we out of gas?" he asked calmly.</t1041>
<t1042>"Look!"</t1042>
<t1043>About half a dozen fingers pointed at the wheel that had been severed.</t1043> <t1044>He stared at it for a moment, then looked up as if suspecting it had fallen from the sky.</t1044>
<t1045>"It fell off." Someone explained.</t1045>
<t1046>He nodded.</t1046>
<t1047>"I didn't notice that our car had stopped."</t1047>
<t1048>Pausing for a moment, then taking a deep breath and straightening his shoulders, he spoke with a determined voice.</t1048>
<t1049>"Does anyone know where the gas station is?"</t1049>
<t1050>At least about a dozen men, some of whom were more alert than he was, explained to him that there was no longer any piece connecting the wheel to the vehicle.</t1050>
<t1051>"Reverse." After a moment, he suggested.</t1051> <t1052>"Shift to reverse."</t1052>
<t1053>"But the WHEEL has already come off!"</t1053>
<t1054>He hesitated slightly.</t1054>
<t1055>"There's no harm in trying."</t1055>
<t1056>The car horn sounded like a cat's wail, reaching its peak, I turned my back and walked across the lawn to go home, only glancing back one more time.</t1056> <t1057>A thin, full moon was shimmering, casting its light over Gatsby's house, creating a beautiful moonlit evening just like the previous moonlit nights, as if the moon was unaffected by the laughter and noises emanating from the still vibrant garden.</t1057> <t1058>A sudden emptiness poured out from the windows and the large doors, completely enveloping and isolating the figure of the host standing on the porch, with his arm raised in a solemn farewell wave.</t1058>
<t1059>Reading again what I have written so far, I think I have given the reader the impression that the events occurring over three nights, spaced weeks apart, were things I was diligently focused on. On the contrary, they were just ordinary events in a busy summer, and only later did they infinitely capture my interest, even more than my personal issues.</t1059>
<t1060>I spend most of my time working.</t1060> <t1061>Every early morning, as the sunlight casts my shadow towards the west, I am hurrying through the white canyons of downtown New York to my workplace called Probity Trust.</t1061> <t1062>I am familiar with the secretaries and the young stockbrokers in the office, calling them by their nicknames.</t1062> <t1063>We have lunch together in dark, crowded diners with dishes like pork sausages, mashed potatoes, and coffee.</t1063> <t1064>I also had a brief romance with a girl who worked in the accounting department and lived in New Jersey.</t1064> <t1065>However, when her brother started giving me fierce, hostile looks, I quietly ended this relationship in July when she went on vacation.</t1065>
<t1066>I usually have dinner at the Yale Club.</t1066> <t1067>For some reason, I find this activity to be one of the most melancholic and dreary parts of my day.</t1067> <t1068>After that, I go to the library upstairs to diligently research stock investments for an entire hour.</t1068> <t1069>Usually, there are a few people making noise at the club, but they never enter the library, so it remains a good place for me to work.</t1069> <t1070>Then, as the evening cools down, I stroll down Madison Avenue, past the old Murray Hill Hotel to 33rd Street to reach Pennsylvania Station.</t1070>
<t1071>I began to feel a fondness for New York City, loving the thrilling, scorching sensation of the night and the satisfaction of seeing the continuous flickering from the figures of men, women, and vehicles appearing before my restless eyes.</t1071><t1072>I enjoyed walking against the flow on Fifth Avenue, picking out from the crowd those affectionate women and imagining in my mind that in just a few minutes, I would step into their lives without anyone knowing or objecting.</t1072><t1073>Sometimes, in my imagination, I followed them back to their apartments, somewhere on a hidden corner, and they would turn back and smile at me before disappearing through the door into the warm darkness.</t1073><t1074>In the city's captivating dim light, sometimes I sensed a haunting loneliness, feeling it from others, from the young, impoverished office workers lingering in front of windows waiting for the time to enter the quiet dinner eateries, or from the young secretaries wandering in the twilight, wasting away the bitterest moments of the night and their lives.</t1074>
<t1075>Then around eight in the evening, when the dark interior of Forties Street was crowded with five rows of taxis packed with passengers heading towards the theater district, I felt my heart sink.</t1075> <t1076>The shapes of people leaning against each other inside the waiting taxis, the cheerful voices, the laughter from indistinguishable jokes, the sparks on the tips of cigarettes sketching out incomprehensible shapes.</t1076> <t1077>Just imagine, I too, was hurrying towards the bustling places, sharing with</t1077>
<t1078>Give them their own private joys.</t1078> <t1079>I wish them good things.</t1079>
<t1080>There was a time I didn't see Jordan Baker again until around mid-summer when I met her again.</t1080> <t1081>At first, I felt very proud to go places with Baker because Jordan was a well-known female golf champion.</t1081> <t1082>Then later, there were many other things.</t1082> <t1083>At that time, I wasn't really in love with Jordan, just felt a very gentle curiosity.</t1083> <t1084>Jordan's haughty, bored face when facing everyone around contained something, if it didn't show up at first, it would eventually reveal itself, a look that seemed to hide something.</t1084> <t1085>Then one day I found out what it was.</t1085> <t1086>When we attended a party held at a house on Warwick, Jordan forgot to close the top of the car she borrowed and left it out in the rain.</t1086> <t1087>After that, Jordan lied about it.</t1087> <t1088>The incident suddenly reminded me of the story I couldn't recall the night at Daisy's house. At a major golf tournament that Jordan first participated in, there was such an uproar that it almost made the newspapers. Someone accused Jordan of moving her golf ball from a disadvantageous position.</t1088> <t1089>This incident had the magnitude of a scandal, but then it was suppressed.</t1089>
<t1090>The golf ball retriever has retracted his statement, and the sole witness also admitted that he might have been mistaken.</t1090> <t1091>The story and the names involved in this case have become intertwined and remain etched in my memory.</t1091>
<t1092>By instinct, Jordan Baker often avoided cunning and shrewd men.</t1092> <t1093>And now I realize that Jordan did so because she felt she would be safer with the kind of people who believed that deviations from the rules were impossible.</t1093> <t1094>Jordan was an incorrigible liar.</t1094> <t1095>She couldn't stand being in a disadvantageous position.</t1095> <t1096>I suppose this deceitfulness had been developed since she was young in order to maintain that cold, arrogant smile towards the world around her, while also satisfying the demands of her lively and vigorous body.</t1096>
<t1097>That matter didn't change anything in me.</t1097> <t1098>The deceit of a woman is something one can never continually blame.</t1098> <t1099>I only felt regret for a moment, but then quickly forgot about it.</t1099> <t1100>Also, during that party, the two of us had a strange conversation about driving.</t1100> <t1101>The story began when Jordan drove too close to a road worker, so close that our car's fender lightly brushed against the worker's button.</t1101>
<t1102>"You really are a reckless driver." I protested.</t1102> <t1103>"Either you should be more careful, or you shouldn't drive at all."</t1103>
<t1104>"I am careful."</t1104>
<t1105>"Not at all, you weren't careful."</t1105>
<t1106>"So, someone else has been careful." Jordan said gently.</t1106>
<t1107>"So, will that help?"</t1107>
<t1108>"Those people will avoid you," Jordan said firmly.</t1108> <t1109>"It takes two careless people to cause an accident."</t1109>
<t1110>"Suppose you meet someone who is as careless as you."</t1110>
<t1111>"I hope I never meet them." Jordan replied.</t1111> <t1112>"I hate careless people.</t1112> <t1113>That's why I like you."</t1113>
<t1114>Jordan's gray eyes, weary from the sun, looked straight ahead, but in truth, Jordan had deliberately changed the relationship between the two of us.</t1114> <t1115>For a moment, I thought I was in love with Jordan.</t1115> <t1116>However, because I am always deliberate in my thoughts and have many rules of my own, I restrained my desires.</t1116> <t1117>I knew I first had to permanently untangle the complicated relationship back home.</t1117> <t1118>For a long time, once a week, I would often write letters signing them at the bottom: "Love you.</t1118> <t1119>Nick." But at those moments, all I could think about was how that girl, when playing tennis, could sweat so much above her upper lip.</t1119> <t1120>Anyway, there was a vague understanding that I had to skillfully sever that relationship before I could be free.</t1120>
<t1121>Each person believes that they possess at least one fundamental virtue, and my fundamental virtue is: I am one of the few honest people I have ever known.</t1121>
<t1122>Chapter 4</t1122>
<t1123>On Sunday morning, when the church bells tolled in the coastal villages, everyone, along with their lovers, returned to Gatsby's house, bustling and gliding joyfully across his lawn.</t1123>
<t1124>"He is a smuggler." The young women whispered to each other as they strolled back and forth between cocktails and flower bushes.</t1124> <t1125>"Once, he killed a man just because the man discovered that he was the grandson of Von Hindenburg, and a cousin to the devil."</t1125> <t1126>"Could you give me the rose petal, darling, and by the way, pour me the last drop of wine into that crystal glass."</t1126>
<t1127>Once, I wrote on the blank spaces of a train timetable the names of those who visited Gatsby's house that summer.</t1127> <t1128>That timetable, with the note "Schedule effective from July 5, 1922" on its surface, is now old and tattered at the folds.</t1128> <t1129>Yet, I can still read the names with faded ink, and they can give us a better impression than my general descriptions of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and showed their delicate respect by pretending not to know about him.</t1129>
<t1130>From East Egg, there were Mr. and Mrs. Chester Becker, Mr. and Mrs. Leech, and a man named Bunsen whom I had known at Yale.</t1130> <t1131>There was Dr. Webster Civet, who drowned last summer in the state of Maine. Then there were Mr. and Mrs. Hornbeam, Mr. and Mrs. Willie Voltaire, and the entire Blackbuck family, who always stood together in a corner and raised their noses like goats whenever someone approached.</t1131> <t1132>There were Mr. and Mrs. Ismay and Mr. and Mrs. Chrystie (or more precisely, Mr. Hubert Auerbach and Mrs. Chrystie's wife), and Mr. Edgar Beaver, whose hair, as people said, turned white as snow in a single winter afternoon for no apparent reason.</t1132>
<t1133>If I remember correctly, there was Clarence Endive from East Egg.</t1133> <t1134>He came only once wearing knee-length shorts, and got into a fight with a loafer named Etty in the garden.</t1134> <t1135>From farther across the island came the Cheadle couple, the O. R. P. Schraeder couple, and the Stonewall Jackson Abram couple from Georgia.</t1135> <t1136>There were the Fishguard couple and the Ripley Snell couple.</t1136> <t1137>Mr. Snell had been there three days before going to jail; he was dead drunk lying on the gravel path and got his right arm run over by Mrs. Ulysses Swett's car.</t1137> <t1138>The Dancy couple also came, and there was S. B. Whitebait who was over sixty years old.</t1138> <t1139>There were Maurice A. Flink, the Hammerhead couple, and even the Beluga importer family who brought along their mistresses.</t1139>
<t1140>From West Egg came the Poles, the Mulreadys, Cecil Roebuck, Cecil Schoen, Senator Gulick, and Newton Orchid, who ran the film company Films Par Excellence.</t1140> <t1141>There were Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen, Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all of whom were connected to the film industry in one way or another.</t1141> <t1142>There were the Catlips, the Bembergs, and Mr. G. Earl Muldoon.</t1142> <t1143>Mr. Muldoon's brother later strangled his wife to death.</t1143> <t1144>Advertising man Da Fontano also came, as did Ed Legros and James B. ("Rot-Gut") Ferret, the De Jongs, and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble, and when Ferret wandered through the garden, it meant he had lost everything, and the stock prices of Associated</t1144> <t1145>Traction would fluctuate wildly the next day.</t1145>
<t1146>A man named Klipspringer was there so often and for so long that he was given the nickname "the boarder."</t1146> <t1147>I suspected he didn't have a home anywhere.</t1147> <t1148>People from the performing arts who came there included Gus Waize, Horace O'donavan, Lester Meyer, George Duckweed, and Francis Bull. From New York, there were Mr. and Mrs. Chrome, Mr. and Mrs. Backhysson, Mr. and Mrs. Dennicker, Russel Betty, Mr. and Mrs. Corrigan, Mr. and Mrs. Kelleher, Mr. and Mrs. Dewar, Mr. and Mrs. Scully, S. W. Belcher, Mr. and Mrs. Smirke, and the young couple Quinn, now divorced.</t1148> <t1149>There was Henry L. Palmetto, who committed suicide by throwing himself in front of a train at Times Square.</t1149>
<t1150>Benny McClenahan always arrived with four girls.</t1150> <t1151>They were not always the same girls, but they were so identical to one another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before.</t1151> <t1152>I had forgotten their names, but I remembered that if it wasn't Jacquelin, it was Consuela, or Gloria, or Judy, or June.</t1152> <t1153>As for their last names, they seemed to be melodious names of flowers, months of the year, or the dignified names of some American plutocratic families who, if pressed, would claim kinship.</t1153>
<t1154>Besides the aforementioned people, I remember that Faustina O'Brien also came once, along with the Baedeker daughters and Brewer's son, who had his nose shot off in the war.</t1154> <t1155>There were Albrucksburger and his fiancée, Miss Haag.</t1155> <t1156>There were Mr. and Mrs. Ardita Fitz-Peter and Mr. P. Jewett, who had once led the American Legion veterans' association.</t1156> <t1157>There was Miss Claudia Hip and a man rumored to be her driver.</t1157> <t1158>There was also some prince everyone called the Duke, whose name, if I ever knew it, I have now forgotten.</t1158>
<t1159>All of these people had come to Gatsby's house that summer.</t1159>
<t1160>Around nine o'clock on a late July morning, Gatsby's splendid car wobbled up the rough road leading to my house, emitting a series of musical notes from its three-note horn.</t1160> <t1161>This was the first time Gatsby visited me, although I had attended two parties at his house, had flown a seaplane with him, and had frequently used his beach as he had earnestly invited.</t1161>
<t1162>"Hello, old friend.</t1162> <t1163>We</t1163>
<t1164>We made a lunch date, and I came here to pick you up."</t1164>
<t1165>Gatsby sat confidently on the running board of his car with a sophisticated demeanor that is distinctly American. I believe that this mannerism did not come from weightlifting or a rigid sitting posture from childhood, but rather from the elegance of sports.</t1165> <t1166>This distinctive trait continued to manifest in his meticulous and fussy personality, always under the guise of restless energy.</t1166> <t1167>Gatsby never stood still, his feet always tapping somewhere or his hands impatiently opening and closing.</t1167>
<t1168>Gatsby saw me admiring the car.</t1168>
<t1169>"This car is beautiful, isn't it, old friend?" Gatsby stepped aside so I could get a better look.</t1169> <t1170>"Haven't you seen this car before</t1170><t1171>?"</t1171>
<t1172>I have seen it before.</t1172> <t1173>Everyone has seen it before.</t1173> <t1174>The car is dark cream-colored, with shiny chrome plating, incredibly long, bulging here and there with many compartments for storing hats, food boxes, and toolboxes.</t1174> <t1175>Above, there are numerous windshields that can reflect dozens of suns.</t1175>
<t1176>Sitting in the car behind many layers of glass that looked like a greenhouse, we set off into the city.</t1176>
<t1177>I had talked to Gatsby five or six times in the past month, but I was really disappointed to realize that he didn't have much to say.</t1177> <t1178>Therefore, my initial impression that he was some important figure gradually faded away.</t1178> <t1179>To me, he now was just a complicated roadside innkeeper.</t1179>
<t1180>And then this trip turned my thoughts upside down.</t1180> <t1181>When we had not yet reached the village of West Egg, Gatsby began to trail off his elegant and graceful sentences, hesitantly patting his knee in his light brown suit.</t1181>
<t1182>"Listen here, old sport." Gatsby suddenly said.</t1182> <t1183>"What do you think of me?" Slightly taken aback, I began to give evasive, general answers typically reserved for such questions.</t1183>
<t1184>"Alright, I'll tell you a little bit about my life." Gatsby interrupted.</t1184> <t1185>"I don't want you to misunderstand me because of the things you've heard."</t1185>
<t1186>It turns out that Gatsby had learned about the bizarre slanders that had spiced up the conversations in the rooms of his house.</t1186>
<t1187>"I will tell you the truth." Gatsby's right arm suddenly raised as if to swear.</t1187> <t1188>"I am the son of a wealthy family from the Midwest, all of my family members have passed away.</t1188> <t1189>I was raised in America but went to school at Oxford because my ancestors have been educated there for many generations.</t1189> <t1190>It is a tradition of my family line.</t1190>
<t1191>Gatsby glanced sideways at me, and now I knew why Jordan Baker thought he was lying.</t1191> <t1192>Gatsby quickly said the phrase "studied at Oxford" as if swallowing the words, as if they had been stuck in his throat and had long caused him discomfort.</t1192> <t1193>With this doubt, all of Gatsby's words seemed to shatter into pieces, and I wondered if, in the end, he wasn't harboring something sinister.</t1193>
<t1194>"Which part of the Midwest?" I asked casually.</t1194>
<t1195>"San Francisco"</t1195>
<t1196>"Is that so."</t1196>
<t1197>"My entire family passed away, and I inherited a vast fortune."</t1197>
<t1198>Gatsby's voice was very solemn, as if the memory of the sudden demise of his family still haunted him.</t1198> <t1199>For a moment, I suspected Gatsby was joking with me, but when I glanced at him, I completely believed him again.</t1199>
<t1200>"After that, I lived like a young prince across the capitals of Europe such as Paris, Venice, Rome - Collecting jewelry, mainly rubies, hunting big game, also doing a bit of painting - all personal activities to try to forget the sorrows that had happened to me in the past."</t1200>
<t1201>I had to try hard to keep myself from bursting into skeptical laughter.</t1201> <t1202>The words used were so outdated that they evoked no image other than that of a character wearing an Arab-style turban,</t1202> <t1203>sawdust falling from every pore as he chased a tiger through the trees of Bois de Boulogne park in western Paris.</t1203>
<t1204>"Then the war broke out, my old friend.</t1204> <t1205>At that time, I felt it was a great liberation, I tried everything to die, but it seemed my life had been granted a miraculous blessing.</t1205> <t1206>When I first enlisted, I was given the rank of Lieutenant.</t1206> <t1207>In the Argonne Forest, I commanded two machine gun squads to advance half a mile ahead between the two armies, where the infantry couldn't reach.</t1207> <t1208>We stayed there for two days and two nights with one hundred and thirty soldiers and sixteen Lewis machine guns.</t1208> <t1209>When the infantry managed to reach there, they found the insignia of three German divisions among the corpses.</t1209> <t1210>I was promoted to Major and all the Allied governments awarded me medals, even Montenegro, the small country on the Adriatic Sea."</t1210>
<t1211>The small country of Montenegro! Gatsby raised his voice and nodded as he mentioned these words with a smile.</t1211> <t1212>A smile that seemed to sympathize with the tangled history of Montenegro and the brave struggle of its people. My skepticism was completely submerged in admiration, and I found myself seemingly rushing through dozens of magazine pages.</t1212>
<t1213>Gatsby reached into his pocket, took out a medal tied with a ribbon, and placed it in my palm.</t1213>
<t1214>"This dish is a gift from Montenegro."</t1214>
<t1215>I was amazed because that object looked very real, with text printed in a circle around it.</t1215>
<t1216>"Order of Danilo, Montenegro, King Nicholas."</t1216>
<t1217>"Flip to the other side and see."</t1217>
<t1218>"Lieutenant Colonel Gatsby.</t1218> <t1219>Symbolizes extraordinary courage." I read.</t1219>
<t1220>"There is one more thing that I always carry with me.</t1220> <t1221>A memento from the days in Oxford.</t1221> <t1222>The picture was taken at Trinity Quad - the person standing to the left next to me is now the Earl of Dorcaster."</t1222>
<t1223>It is a picture of about five or six young men in uniform jackets standing under an arched gate, through which one can clearly see a row of bell towers.</t1223> <t1224>In the picture, there is Gatsby, looking younger than he does now but not by much, holding a cricket bat.</t1224>
<t1225>That is indeed the truth.</t1225> <t1226>I seem to see the tiger skins being splendidly displayed in his castle on the Grand Canal.</t1226> <t1227>I also seem to see him opening a box full of rubies emitting a deep red light to soothe the anguish in his broken heart.</t1227>
<t1228>"Today I have something important I need your help with." Gatsby said, putting his mementos into his pocket with a satisfied and contented look.</t1228> <t1229>"Therefore, I think you need to know more about me.</t1229> <t1230>I don't want you to think that I'm just some ordinary person.</t1230> <t1231>You see, I'm always surrounded by strangers because I often wander around to try to forget the sad story that happened to me." Gatsby hesitated.</t1231> <t1232>"You will hear the story this afternoon."</t1232>
<t1233>"At lunch?"</t1233>
<t1234>"No, this afternoon."</t1234> <t1235>"I happened to find out that you have an appointment with Miss Baker to have tea."</t1235>
<t1236>"Do you mean that you are in love with Miss Baker?"</t1236>
<t1237>"No, my old friend.</t1237> <t1238>I don't have it.</t1238> <t1239>However, Miss Baker has kindly agreed to let me talk to you about this matter."</t1239>
<t1240>I have not the slightest idea about "this matter", but I feel more bothered than curious to know.</t1240> <t1241>It's not that I invited Jordan for tea to discuss Mr. Gatsby's affairs.</t1241> <t1242>I am sure the request must be for something very thrilling, and for a moment I regretted ever stepping onto his crowded lawn.</t1242>
<t1243>Gatsby did not say another word.</t1243> <t1244>He looked even more serious and composed as we approached the street.</t1244> <t1245>We passed by Roosevelt Harbor where we could catch a glimpse of the ocean liners with red bands painted on their sides.</t1245> <t1246>The car sped quickly along a shabby cobblestone street.</t1246> <t1247>On both sides of the road were dimly lit but not empty taverns from the bygone golden era of the early 1900s.</t1247> <t1248>The valley of ashes began to appear on either side of the road, and I could catch a glimpse of Wilson’s wife working hard at the gas station, her figure breathing heavily with energy as our car passed by.</t1248>
<t1249>With the fenders flaring out like wings, our car sped along as if scattering light across half of Long Island City.</t1249> <t1250>Only halfway there, while our car was still weaving through the high bridge pillars, I heard the familiar explosive sound of a police motorcycle, and a police officer was aggressively riding alongside.</t1250>
<t1251>"Alright, old sport." Gatsby said loudly, slowing down the car.</t1251> <t1252>Taking out a white card from his pocket, Gatsby held it up and waved it in front of the policeman.</t1252>
<t1253>"Alright." The police officer agreed, lightly touching his hat in salute.</t1253> <t1254>"Next time I will recognize you, Mr. Gatsby.</t1254> <t1255>Sorry."</t1255>
<t1256>"What is that?" I boldly asked. "Is that a picture of Oxford?"</t1256>
<t1257>"I once helped a councilman and he sends me a Christmas card every year."</t1257>
<t1258>Walking across the large bridge, sunlight streamed through the beams, creating shimmering, dancing rays continuously on the moving vehicles.</t1258> <t1259>On the other side of the river, the city slowly rose before the eyes like white blocks and like sugar cubes built up through a wish from scentless coins.</t1259> <t1260>The city, when viewed from the Queensboro Bridge, always seemed like it was being seen for the first time, with a wild promise to offer us the mysteries and beauties of the world.</t1260>
<t1261>A funeral procession passed by in a hearse filled with flowers, followed by two horse-drawn carriages with closed curtains, and then more carriages carrying friends who seemed more cheerful.</t1261> <t1262>These friends looked up at us with sorrowful eyes, their short upper lips characteristic of the people from Southeastern Europe. I was also glad that the image of Gatsby's splendid car was included in their somber and gloomy funeral day.</t1262> <t1263>As we passed by Blackwell's Island, a limousine sped past our car.</t1263> <t1264>The driver was a white man, and inside were three black people dressed in the latest fashion, two young men and a girl.</t1264> <t1265>I burst out laughing when I saw their eyes glaring at us with envious arrogance.</t1265>
<t1266>"Now</t1266>
<t1267>Once my car has crossed the bridge, anything can happen." I thought. "Anything at all..."</t1267>
<t1268>"Even Gatsby, there was nothing particularly extraordinary."</t1268>
<t1269>In the noisy and bustling noon, under the breezy Forty-second Street tunnel, I arranged to meet Gatsby for lunch.</t1269> <t1270>After blinking away the dazzling sunlight outside, my eyes adjusted to recognize him in the dim outer room, conversing with another man.</t1270>
<t1271>"Mr. Carraway, this is my friend, Mr. Wolfsheim."</t1271>
<t1272>A small Jewish man, with a flat nose, raised his big head to greet me with two tufts of lush nose hair sticking out from his nostrils.</t1272> <t1273>It took me a while to see his tiny eyes in the half-light, half-darkness.</t1273>
<t1274>"..</t1274> <t1275>Then I watched him." Mr. Wolssheim said as he shook my hand eagerly.</t1275> <t1276>"And do you know what I thought?"</t1276>
<t1277>"What are you thinking?" I asked politely.</t1277>
<t1278>It was clear that he was not talking to me, because he let go of my hand and directed his highly expressive nose towards Gatsby.</t1278>
<t1279>"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said, 'Alright, Katspaugh, don't give him a single penny until he shuts up.'</t1279> <t1280>So he shut up immediately, right on the spot."</t1280>
<t1281>Gatsby took both our arms and led us inside the restaurant.</t1281> <t1282>At that moment, Mr. Wolfsheim had to swallow a sentence he was about to say and let himself fall into a state like sleepwalking.</t1282>
<t1283>"Whiskey soda?" the waiter asked.</t1283>
<t1284>"This restaurant is beautiful." Wolfsheim said, looking up at the paintings of goddesses from the religion depicted on the ceiling.</t1284> <t1285>"But I prefer the restaurant across the street!"</t1285>
<t1286>"Yes, give me a whiskey soda." Gatsby replied, then turned to Wolfsheim.</t1286> <t1287>"It's very hot over there."</t1287>
<t1288>"That's right, hot and small." Wolfsheim said.</t1288> <t1289>"But full of memories."</t1289>
<t1290>"Which restaurant is that?" I asked.</t1290>
<t1291>"The old Metropole restaurant."</t1291>
<t1292>"The old Metropole." Wolfsheim pondered sadly.</t1292> <t1293>"Filled with images of faces long gone.</t1293> <t1294>Filled with the shadows of friends who have departed forever.</t1294> <t1295>As long as I live, I can never forget the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.</t1295> <t1296>There were six of us sitting at the table, and Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot that night.</t1296> <t1297>As dawn was approaching, the waiter came over to him with a strange look and said that someone wanted to talk to him outside.</t1297> <t1298>"Alright." Rosy said and began to stand up.</t1298> <t1299>I pulled him back into his seat."</t1299>
<t1300>"Let those bastards in if they want, Rosy, but please help me, don't leave this room."</t1300>
<t1301>"It was four in the morning, and if we had drawn the curtains to look, we could have seen the sunlight."</t1301>
<t1302>"Did he go outside?" I asked innocently.</t1302>
<t1303>"He definitely left, didn't he." Wolfsheim's nose turned towards me indignantly.</t1303> <t1304>"When he reached the door, he turned around and said, 'Don't let the waiter take my coffee cup away!' Then he went out onto the sidewalk, and they shot him three times right in his full belly before driving away."</t1304>
<t1305>"The four of them were later executed by electric chair." I continued, recalling the story.</t1305>
<t1306>"Yes, including Becker." His nostrils flared towards me with interest. "As far as I know, you're looking for a business connection."</t1306>
<t1307>These two consecutive sentences surprised me.</t1307> <t1308>Gatsby answered for me.</t1308>
<t1309>"Oh, no, not this person."</t1309>
<t1310>"Isn't it?" Wolfsheim looked disappointed.</t1310>
<t1311>"This guy is just a friend."</t1311> <t1312>"I told you, we will talk about that later."</t1312>
<t1313>"I'm sorry, I mistook you for someone else." Wolfsheim said.</t1313>
<t1314>The delicious minced meat dish was served, Wolfsheim had forgotten the sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole restaurant, and began to eat politely but vigorously.</t1314> <t1315>While eating, his eyes slowly rolled around the room, ending his gaze by examining the people sitting right behind him.</t1315> <t1316>I suppose, because of my presence, otherwise he would have also glanced under the table he was sitting at.</t1316>
<t1317>"Listen here, old sport." Gatsby said, leaning towards me.</t1317> <t1318>"I'm afraid I made you a bit upset this morning while we were in the car."</t1318>
<t1319>The old smile appeared again, but this time I resisted it.</t1319>
<t1320>"I don't like mysteries." I replied.</t1320> <t1321>"And I don't understand why you can't just tell me directly what you want. Why go through Miss Baker?"</t1321>
<t1322>"Oh, there's nothing clandestine or shady at all." Gatsby reassured me. "Miss Baker is a famous athlete, you know, she wouldn't do anything if it wasn't proper."</t1322>
<t1323>Suddenly Gatsby looked at the clock and then stood up, hurriedly leaving the room, leaving me and Wolfsheim still at the table.</t1323>
<t1324>"He has to make a phone call." Wolfsheim said, eyes following Gatsby.</t1324> <t1325>"He is quite a young man, isn't he?</t1325> <t1326>A man both handsome and entirely courteous."</t1326>
<t1327>"That's right."</t1327>
<t1328>"He is from Oggsford"</t1328>
<t1329>"Oh, really"</t1329>
<t1330>"He studied at Oggsford in England."</t1330> <t1331>"Do you know the school Oggsford?"</t1331>
<t1332>"I have heard about this school."</t1332>
<t1333>"It is one of the most famous universities in the world."</t1333>
<t1334>"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?" I probed.</t1334>
<t1335>"Many years now." Wolfsheim replied contentedly.</t1335> <t1336>"I am glad to have known him, right after the war.</t1336> <t1337>Only after talking to him for about an hour, I knew I had discovered an outstanding young man. I told myself: 'This is the kind of young man I want to bring home to introduce to my mother and sister.'</t1337><t1338>" Wolfsheim paused for a moment.</t1338> <t1339>"I noticed you were looking at my cufflinks." In fact, I wasn't looking, but hearing him say that, I now turned to look.</t1339> <t1340>They were made from pieces of ivory in shapes not commonly seen.</t1340>
<t1341>"They are the most beautiful molars of a human." He informed me.</t1341>
<t1342>"Wow!" I observed. "This is really an amusing initiative."</t1342>
<t1343>"That's right." Wolfsheim flipped the two flaps of his coat sleeves outward.</t1343> <t1344>"Yes, Gatsby was very cautious about women.</t1344> <t1345>He would even avoid looking at your wife."</t1345>
<t1346>When this trustworthy character being talked about returned to sit at the table, Mr. Wolfsheim suddenly drank up his coffee and then stood up.</t1346>
<t1347>"This lunch is very delicious." He said.</t1347> <t1348>"But now I must part ways with you before you consider me a nuisance."</t1348>
<t1349>"There's no need to hurry, Meyer." Gatsby said, but he didn't seem very eager.</t1349> <t1350>Mr. Wolfsheim raised his arm in a gesture of salute.</t1350>
<t1351>"You are very polite, but I belong to a different generation." He declared solemnly.</t1351> <t1352>"You two can sit here and discuss sports, music, and..." He replaced his last imaginative noun with another wave of his hand.</t1352> <t1353>"As for me, I am fifty years old, I don't want to bother you any longer."</t1353>
<t1354>When Wolfsheim shook hands in farewell and turned to leave, his pitiable nose quivered.</t1354> <t1355>I wondered if I had said something to offend him.</t1355>
<t1356>"Sometimes he becomes very sentimental," Gatsby explained.</t1356> <t1357>"Today is one of his sentimental days.</t1357> <t1358>He is truly a special character in New York, a resident of Broadway."</t1358>
<t1359>"Who is he, an actor</t1359><t1360>?"</t1360>
<t1361>"No."</t1361>
<t1362>"Dentist?"</t1362>
<t1363>"Myer Wolfsheim? No, he's a gambler." Gatsby hesitated, then added coldly.</t1363> <t1364>"He was the man who fixed the 1919 World Series."</t1364>
<t1365>"Arrangements before the World Baseball Classic?" I repeated.</t1365>
<t1366>This understanding stunned me.</t1366> <t1367>Of course, I remembered that the 1919 World Series had been fixed, but if I could think about it, I would only consider it a natural event, the result of a series of ordinary developments.</t1367> <t1368>In my mind, there had never been the idea that a man could deceive the trust of fifty million people with the same purpose as a thief cracking a safe.</t1368>
<t1369>"How could he do that?" After a moment, I asked.</t1369>
<t1370>"When the opportunity presents itself, he seizes it."</t1370>
<t1371>"Why wasn't he imprisoned?"</t1371>
<t1372>"They cannot catch him, old friend.</t1372> <t1373>He is a clever man."</t1373>
<t1374>I was determined to pay for the meal.</t1374> <t1375>When the waiter brought the change back, I recognized the figure of Tom Buchanan on the other side of the crowded room.</t1375>
<t1376>"Follow me here for a minute." I said.</t1376> <t1377>"I have to go greet this person." Just then, Tom recognized us, he immediately stood up and took five or six steps towards us.</t1377>
<t1378>"Where have you been lately?" Tom asked eagerly. "Daisy is upset because you haven't called in a long time."</t1378>
<t1379>"I introduce, this is Mr. Gatsby and this is Mr. Buchanan."</t1379>
<t1380>The two of them shook hands briefly, awkwardly, an embarrassed look appearing on Gatsby's face.</t1380>
<t1381>"How have you been lately?" Tom asked me. "What brings you all the way here to eat?"</t1381>
<t1382>"I went to have lunch with Mr. Gatsby."</t1382>
<t1383>I turned to Gatsby but he was no longer standing there.</t1383>
<t1384>One day in October of the year one thousand nine hundred and seventeen.....</t1384>
<t1385>(That afternoon, sitting very upright on a straight-backed chair in the tea garden of the Plaza Hotel, Jordan began to tell the story).</t1385>
<t1386>"I was wandering around from place to place, sometimes on the sidewalk, sometimes on the grassy areas.</t1386> <t1387>I preferred walking on the grass because I was wearing shoes bought from England with rubber soles that easily gripped the soft ground.</t1387> <t1388>At that time, I was wearing a plaid skirt that was slightly lifted by the wind.</t1388> <t1389>Whenever that happened, the red, white, and blue flags in front of the houses would fly straight out and make a disapproving "tut tut tut tut" sound.</t1389>
<t1390>The largest flag and the largest lawn belonged to Daisy Fay's house. At that time, Daisy was only eighteen years old, two years older than you, and was the most famous among the young ladies in Louisville.</t1390> <t1391>She always wore white and drove a white two-seater convertible.</t1391> <t1392>All day long, the phone in her house never stopped ringing, as eager officers from the Taylor military camp called to request the privilege of having Daisy to themselves that evening. "Even if it's just for an hour."</t1392>
<t1393>That morning when I passed by Daisy's house, her white convertible was parked close to the sidewalk, and she was sitting in the car with a lieutenant I had never seen before.</t1393> <t1394>The two of them were so engrossed in each other that they didn't see me at all.</t1394>
<t1395>when I was only five steps away from them.</t1395>
<t1396>"Hello Jordan." She suddenly called me. "Come here."</t1396>
<t1397>I feel proud because she wants to talk to me; among the older sisters, I admire her the most.</t1397> <t1398>She asked me if I went to the Red Cross to get bandaged.</t1398> <t1399>At that time, I was really going.</t1399> <t1400>She asked me to tell them that she couldn't come that day.</t1400> <t1401>While Daisy was talking, the officer kept looking at her with a gaze that every young girl wishes to be looked at with.</t1401> <t1402>That scene looked so romantic and affectionate, it made me remember it forever.</t1402> <t1403>His name was Jay Gatsby; after that time, I didn't see him again for about four years until I met him again in Long Island, and I still didn't realize they were the same person.</t1403>
<t1404>That year was the year one thousand nine hundred and seventeen.</t1404> <t1405>By the following year, I had a few suitors and I began to participate in competitions.</t1405> <t1406>Therefore, I no longer met Daisy frequently.</t1406> <t1407>Daisy rarely played with anyone, only socializing with those slightly older than her.</t1407> <t1408>There were fierce rumors about her, saying that one winter night her mother discovered her luggage as she was preparing to go to New York to bid farewell to a soldier about to be deployed overseas.</t1408> <t1409>She was stopped from going.</t1409> <t1410>This incident caused her not to speak to anyone in the house for many weeks.</t1410> <t1411>After that, she no longer kept in touch with the soldiers but only socialized with some clumsy local youths with nearsightedness who couldn't join the army.</t1411>
<t1412>By the following autumn, Daisy was cheerful again, as cheerful as she used to be.</t1412> <t1413>She truly stepped out into the world after the armistice, and by February, she was engaged to a man in New Orleans.</t1413> <t1414>But by June, she married Tom Buchanan from Chicago.</t1414> <t1415>The wedding was an unprecedentedly lavish and magnificent affair in Louisville.</t1415> <t1416>Tom brought down a hundred people in four private train cars and rented an entire floor of the Seelbach Hotel.</t1416> <t1417>The day before the wedding, he gave her a pearl necklace worth three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</t1417>
<t1418>I was a bridesmaid.</t1418> <t1419>About half an hour before the wedding reception started, I went to Daisy's room and saw her lying on the bed in her floral wedding dress, beautiful as a June night. She was completely drunk, holding a bottle of Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.</t1419>
<t1420>"Congratulate me." She whispered. "I have never drunk alcohol in my life, but today I find it very delicious."</t1420>
<t1421>"What happened, Daisy?"</t1421>
<t1422>Let me tell you, at that moment I was very scared, I had never seen a girl in such a state.</t1422>
<t1423>"Here you go, darling." She fumbled around the trash can that was on the bed at the time and pulled out a string of pearls.</t1423> <t1424>"Take them downstairs and return them to their owner.</t1424> <t1425>Tell everyone Daisy has changed her mind.</t1425> <t1426>Message that 'Daisy has changed her mind.'</t1426>
<t1427>She began to cry, cry, and cry endlessly.</t1427> <t1428>I rushed outside to find the maid.</t1428> <t1429>The two of us locked the door and gave Daisy a cold bath.</t1429> <t1430>She refused to let go of the letter.</t1430> <t1431>She took it into the bathtub and crumpled it tightly until it turned into a soaked paper ball.</t1431> <t1432>Finally, when she saw it starting to dissolve into pieces like snowflakes, she allowed me to place it on the soap dish.</t1432>
<t1433>However, after that, she did not say another word.</t1433> <t1434>We let her smell a bit of ammonia, applied ice to her forehead, and put her clothes back on.</t1434> <t1435>Only half an hour later, when we stepped out of the room, the pearl necklace was already around her neck, and the matter was considered resolved.</t1435> <t1436>At five o'clock the next day, she married Tom Buchanan without a shiver and began a three-month trip to the South Sea.</t1436>
<t1437>I met the couple again in Santa Barbara when they returned, and I thought I had never seen a woman so passionately in love with her husband as she was.</t1437> <t1438>Whenever he left the room for just about a minute, she would look around seeming very uneasy.</t1438> <t1439>She would ask.</t1439> <t1440>"Where did Tom go?" and appear very absent-minded until she saw him return through the door.</t1440> <t1441>She often sat on the sand with her husband's head resting on her lap for hours.</t1441> <t1442>Her fingers gently stroked his eyes, and she looked at him with an incomprehensible joyful gaze.</t1442> <t1443>The sight of the two of them together was both touching and amusing.</t1443> <t1444>It was August then. A week after I left Santa Barbara, one evening Tom crashed his car into a truck on Ventura Road, and his wheel completely fell off.</t1444> <t1445>The girl who was with him at that time also made it to the news because her arm was broken.</t1445> <t1446>It turned out she was one of the maids at the Santa Barbara hotel.</t1446>
<t1447>In April of the following year, Daisy gave birth to a baby girl, and they then went to live in France for about a year.</t1447> <t1448>I met them one spring in Cannes, then in Deauville, and afterwards they returned to Chicago to settle down there.</t1448> <t1449>Daisy was very well-known in Chicago, as you know.</t1449> <t1450>The two of them often gathered with young, wealthy, and wild party-goers, but among them, Daisy always maintained her reputation.</t1450> <t1451>Perhaps it was because she didn't drink alcohol.</t1451> <t1452>Not drinking among heavy drinkers is also an advantage.</t1452> <t1453>You can keep your mouth shut, and moreover, you can do slightly unusual things without anyone noticing or caring.</t1453> <t1454>Perhaps Daisy had never been involved in an illicit affair, but there was something in her voice...</t1454>
<t1455>Then, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby again for the first time in many years.</t1455> <t1456>That was when I asked you, do you remember?</t1456> <t1457>I asked if you knew Gatsby over in West Egg.</t1457> <t1458>After you had left, Daisy came to my room and woke me up, she asked: 'Which Gatsby?'</t1458> <t1459>At that time, I was half asleep, half awake.</t1459> <t1460>After hearing my description, she said in the strangest voice that it might be someone she used to know.</t1460> <t1461>It wasn't until then that I realized Gatsby was the officer from that day in Daisy's white car.</t1461>
<t1462>When Jordan had finished the story, we had already left the Plaza Hotel about half an hour ago and were driving in the convertible past Central Park.</t1462> <t1463>The sun had set behind the towering apartment buildings of movie stars on West Fifties Street.</t1463> <t1464>Little girls had gathered together like crickets on the grass, their clear voices rising above the hot twilight.</t1464>
<t1465>"I am the handsome man from Arabia."</t1465>
<t1466>Your love originally belongs to me.</t1466>
<t1467>At night when you fall into sleep</t1467>
<t1468>He crawled into my tent looking for you"</t1468>
<t1469>"This is indeed a strange coincidence." I said.</t1469>
<t1470>"Actually, it wasn't a coincidence at all?"</t1470>
<t1471>"Why not?"</t1471>
<t1472>"Gatsby bought that house to be across the bay from Daisy."</t1472>
<t1473>If that is true, then that June night Gatsby did not go out just to look at the stars.</t1473> <t1474>Now I can feel him.</t1474> <t1475>Gatsby had suddenly been stripped out of his magnificent, purposeless shell.</t1475>
<t1476>"He wants to know," Jordan continued. "If you could invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over."</t1476>
<t1477>This overly modest request moved me.</t1477> <t1478>He had waited five long years, bought a massive castle where he could distribute starlight to the moths, just so that one day he might "drop by" the garden of a stranger.</t1478>
<t1479>"Do I need to know everything like this before he can ask for a small favor like that?"</t1479>
<t1480>"He is afraid, he has waited too long.</t1480> <t1481>He thinks you will be displeased.</t1481> <t1482>You see, beneath that tough and strong exterior, he is just an ordinary person.</t1482><t1483>"</t1483>
<t1484>There is something that makes me uneasy.</t1484>
<t1485>"Why didn't he ask me to arrange the meeting?"</t1485>
<t1486>"He wants Daisy to see his house." Jorsan explained.</t1486> <t1487>"And his house is right next door."</t1487>
<t1488>"Oh."</t1488>
<t1489>"He thought that one evening Daisy might wander into one of his parties." Jordan continued.</t1489> <t1490>"But she never did.</t1490> <t1491>After that, he would casually ask others if they knew Daisy.</t1491> <t1492>You were the first person he found.</t1492> <t1493>That was the night at the ball when he had someone invite you in to meet him.</t1493> <t1494>You should have heard how he beat around the bush.</t1494> <t1495>Of course, I immediately suggested a lunch in New York, and I thought he had gone mad:</t1495>
<t1496>'I don't want to have to do anything troublesome that involves going so far away'</t1496> <t1497>He kept saying, 'I just want to meet her right next to my house.'</t1497><t1498>'</t1498>
<t1499>"When he heard you say that you were a special friend of Tom, he abandoned all his schemes.</t1499> <t1500>He didn't know much about Tom, although he had read the Chicago newspapers for many years just hoping to find Daisy's name mentioned."</t1500>
<t1501>It was now completely dark, as the two of us walked under the foot of a small bridge, I put my arm around Jordan's delicate shoulders and pulled her closer to me, I invited Jordan to dinner.</t1501> <t1502>Suddenly I no longer thought about Daisy or Gatsby, but only about this well-proportioned, firm girl.</t1502> <t1503>A phrase began to ring in my ears, rising to my head with excitement: "Here there is only one person being pursued, one person pursuing, one busy person, and one tired person."</t1503>
<t1504>"Daisy ought to have something in her life as well." Jordan whispered in my ear.</t1504>
<t1505>"Does Daisy want to meet Gatsby?"</t1505>
<t1506>"She shouldn't know about this.</t1506> <t1507>Gatsby doesn't want her to know.</t1507> <t1508>He just pretended to invite her for tea."</t1508>
<t1509>We walked past a row of dark trees to the main face of Fifty Ninth Street, a soft pale shadow cast down in the park.</t1509> <t1510>Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I didn't have any girlfriends whose faces fleetingly passed over the dark eaves or brightly lit billboards.</t1510> <t1511>So I pulled the girl next to me closer, my hands tightening around her.</t1511> <t1512>Jordan's tired and disdainful mouth smiled, and so I pulled her even closer, right up to my face.</t1512>
<t1513>Chapter 5</t1513>
<t1514>When</t1514>
<t1515>I returned home to West Egg that night, and for a moment I thought my house was on fire.</t1515> <t1516>It was two in the morning, and the entire corner of the peninsula seemed to be ablaze with light.</t1516> <t1517>The light fell like an illusion, enveloping the bushes and extending into sparkling rays along the electric wires on the road.</t1517> <t1518>As I turned the corner, I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit up from the top of the tower down to the basement.</t1518>
<t1519>At first, I thought it was another party with the chaotic, frenzied crowd that had turned into a game of "hide and seek" or "sardines in a can," using the entire house as the playground.</t1519> <t1520>However, I didn't hear a single sound.</t1520> <t1521>There was only the rustling sound of the wind blowing through the branches, swaying the power lines, and making the lights flicker on and off as if the house was winking at the surrounding darkness.</t1521> <t1522>As the taxi that brought me back creaked away, I saw Gatsby walking across the lawn towards me.</t1522>
<t1523>"Your house looks like a world's fair." I said.</t1523>
<t1524>"Does it look alike?" He looked at it with a blank stare.</t1524> <t1525>"I am just checking out some rooms."</t1525> <t1526>Let's go to Coney Island, old friend.</t1526> <t1527>Take my car."</t1527>
<t1528>"It's late now."</t1528>
<t1529>"How about we swim in the pool?</t1529> <t1530>I haven't used it all summer."</t1530>
<t1531>"I have to go to sleep."</t1531>
<t1532>"Fine, whatever."</t1532>
<t1533>He looked at me expectantly, trying to suppress his impatience.</t1533>
<t1534>"I have talked to Ms. Baker already." After a moment, I said.</t1534> <t1535>"I will call Daisy tomorrow and invite her here for tea."</t1535>
<t1536>"Oh, that's fine." He said indifferently.</t1536> <t1537>"I don't want to bother you."</t1537>
<t1538>"Which day is convenient for you?"</t1538>
<t1539>"Which day is more convenient for you?" Gatsby quickly corrected me.</t1539> <t1540>"I don't want to put you in a difficult situation, you know."</t1540>
<t1541>"How about the day after tomorrow?" he hesitantly suggested.</t1541> <t1542>Then, hesitantly</t1542>
<t1543>"I want the lawn to be mowed." He said.</t1543>
<t1544>Both of us looked out at the lawn.</t1544> <t1545>There was a distinct line dividing my shaggy, unkempt lawn from his neatly trimmed, lush green lawn.</t1545> <t1546>I thought he was implying something about the grass on my side.</t1546>
<t1547>"There's one more small matter." Gatsby hesitated, not very sure.</t1547>
<t1548>"Or do you want to postpone it a few more days?" I asked.</t1548>
<t1549>"Oh, it's not because of that.</t1549> <t1550>At least..." He awkwardly fumbled for opening words. "I suppose.... - listen here..., old friend, you don't make much money, do you?"</t1550>
<t1551>"Not much."</t1551>
<t1552>This answer seemed to reassure Gatsby, and he continued to speak more confidently.</t1552>
<t1553>"I think so too.</t1553> <t1554>If you forgive my words, you see, I have a small retail business, like a side business.</t1554> <t1555>And I think if you don't make much money...</t1555> <t1556>Are you trading stocks, old friend?"</t1556>
<t1557>"Also trying."</t1557>
<t1558>"In that case, this will interest you. It won't take much of your time and you can make a decent amount."</t1558> <t1559>"This business is a bit discreet."</t1559>
<t1560>I suddenly realized that in a different situation, this conversation could have been one of the turning points in my life.</t1560> <t1561>However, because it was presented so clearly and clumsily as if to repay a favor, I had no choice but to interrupt the story here.</t1561>
<t1562>"I'm very busy right now." I replied.</t1562> <t1563>"I really appreciate it, but at this moment I can't take on any more work."</t1563>
<t1564>"You don't have to do any work with Wolfsheim." Clearly, Gatsby thought I was hesitant and wanted to avoid the "business" that Wolfsheim had mentioned during lunch.</t1564> <t1565>I reassured Gatsby that it wasn't the case.</t1565> <t1566>Gatsby waited a bit longer, hoping I would start talking about something else, but I was in no mood for conversation, so he reluctantly left.</t1566>
<t1567>This evening has made my head light with happiness.</t1567> <t1568>When I just opened the door and stepped into the front house, I thought I had already fallen into a deep sleep.</t1568> <t1569>Therefore, I didn't know whether Gatsby went to Coney Island or not, or how many hours he spent "glancing through the rooms" in his brightly lit house.</t1569> <t1570>The next morning, I called Daisy and invited her over for tea.</t1570>
<t1571>"Don't bring Tom along." I instructed Daisy.</t1571>
<t1572>"What?"</t1572>
<t1573>"Don't bring Tom along."</t1573>
<t1574>"Who is Tom?" Daisy asked innocently.</t1574>
<t1575>On the appointed day, it poured rain.</t1575> <t1576>Around eleven o'clock, a man in a raincoat dragged a lawnmower to my door and said Mr. Gatsby had sent him to trim my lawn.</t1576> <t1577>This reminded me that I had forgotten to ask the Finnish woman to help with the chores.</t1577> <t1578>So I drove into the village of West Egg through the muddy, whitewashed alleys to find her and also to buy a few cups, some lemons, and a few flowers.</t1578>
<t1579>Actually, buying flowers was not necessary, because around two in the afternoon, an entire garden of flowers grown indoors was brought from Gatsby's house to mine with countless vases for arranging them.</t1579> <t1580>Then, an hour later, my door was opened hastily, and Gatsby appeared in a white flannel suit, a silver shirt, and a gold tie, rushing in.</t1580> <t1581>He looked pale, with dark circles under his eyes indicating sleeplessness.</t1581>
<t1582>"Is everything in order?" he immediately asked.</t1582>
<t1583>"The lawn looks nice, if that's what you meant to ask."</t1583>
<t1584>"What grass?" Gatsby asked bewilderedly.</t1584> <t1585>"Oh, the grass in the yard." Through the window, Gatsby looked out at the lawn, but judging by his expression, I believed he saw nothing at all.</t1585>
<t1586>"Looks pretty good." Gatsby said vaguely. "One of the newspapers predicted that the rain would stop around four o'clock.</t1586> <t1587>It seems to be the Journal.</t1587> <t1588>Have you prepared everything for... the tea party?"</t1588>
<t1589>I took Gatsby into the kitchen, he looked at the Finnish woman as if reproaching her.</t1589> <t1590>We carefully tended to the lemon cakes bought from the store.</t1590>
<t1591>"Is that okay now?" I asked.</t1591>
<t1592>"Of course, of course! Well done... my old friend."</t1592>
<t1593>By around half-past three in the afternoon, the rain became lighter and turned into a drizzle, although occasionally there were still drops falling like dew.</t1593> <t1594>Gatsby's godless eyes wandered absently over the pages of Clay's Economics book.</t1594> <t1595>He was startled when the Finnish woman stepped heavily, causing the kitchen floor to shake.</t1595> <t1596>He then frequently looked through the misty windows as if a series of invisible, worrying events were happening outside.</t1596> <t1597>Finally, Gatsby stood up and told me in a doubtful voice that he was going home.</t1597>
<t1598>"Why so?"</t1598>
<t1599>"It's late now, no one is coming for tea." Gatsby looked at his watch as if something somewhere needed his attention. "I can't wait all day."</t1599>
<t1600>"Don't be so silly, it's only two minutes to four."</t1600>
<t1601>Gatsby sat down again miserably as if I had forced him to sit.</t1601> <t1602>At that very moment, there was the sound of a car driving into my driveway.</t1602> <t1603>Both of us stood up abruptly, even I felt nervous at this point, and I went out into the garden.</t1603>
<t1604>Beneath the bare branches of the lilac trees with dripping raindrops, a large convertible car was making its way down the path.</t1604> <t1605>The car stopped, Daisy's face hidden under the tilted brim of a tricorn hat in lilac color, looking at me with a captivating smile.</t1605>
<t1606>"Is this where you live, my dearest love?"</t1606>
<t1607>Daisy's cheerful, babbling voice was a wild resonance amidst the rain.</t1607> <t1608>It took a moment for me to focus and listen to their melodious sound with keen ears before I could understand them.</t1608> <t1609>A wet lock of hair lay like a green streak of paint across Daisy's cheek.</t1609> <t1610>Her hand was wet with sparkling raindrops as I took it to help Daisy out of the car.</t1610>
<t1611>"Are you in love with me?" Daisy whispered in my ear, "if not, why did you ask me to come alone?"</t1611>
<t1612>"That is the secret of Rackrent Castle."</t1612> <t1613>"Tell the driver to go somewhere far away for about an hour."</t1613>
<t1614>"Brother Ferdie, go somewhere for about an hour and then come back." Then Daisy turned to me and whispered, "His name is Ferdie."</t1614>
<t1615>"Does gasoline have any effect on his nose?"</t1615>
<t1616>"I don't think so," Daisy asked innocently.</t1616> <t1617>"Why?"</t1617>
<t1618>We went inside the house.</t1618> <t1619>I was extremely surprised to see the living room completely empty.</t1619>
<t1620>"Well, that's strange." I exclaimed.</t1620>
<t1621>"What the heck?"</t1621>
<t1622>Daisy turned her head when she heard a light knock on the front door.</t1622> <t1623>I stepped out to open the door.</t1623> <t1624>Gatsby, his face pale as a corpse, his hands hanging heavily in his coat pockets, stood in a puddle, staring straight into my eyes.</t1624>
<t1625>With his hands still thrust in the pockets of his coat, Gatsby stealthily followed me into the hallway, making a sharp turn as if walking on a tightrope, and then disappeared into the living room.</t1625> <t1626>The scene was not at all funny.</t1626> <t1627>I heard my heart pounding, I reached out to close the door, and outside, the rain was getting heavier and heavier.</t1627>
<t1628>In the span of about half a minute, I didn't hear a single sound.</t1628> <t1629>Then I heard something coming from the living room that sounded like a mix of murmuring, choking, and joyful laughter, followed by Daisy's artificially clear voice.</t1629> <t1630>"I am so indescribably happy to see you again."</t1630>
<t1631>Then there was an unbearable silence.</t1631> <t1632>I had nothing to do in the hallway, so I had to step inside.</t1632>
<t1633>Gatsby, with both hands still in his pockets, was standing leaning against the fireplace with a completely artificial air of forced nonchalance.</t1633> <t1634>His head was tilted back too far, resting against the face of the broken clock on the mantelpiece.</t1634> <t1635>In this position, Gatsby's frantic eyes stared intently at Daisy, who was sitting on the edge of a chair, looking frightened but gracefully charming.</t1635>
<t1636>"We knew each other from before." Gatsby said softly.</t1636> <t1637>His eyes glanced at me briefly, his lips parted trying to smile but couldn't.</t1637> <t1638>Fortunately, the clock chose that moment to tilt and almost fall due to the weight of his head.</t1638> <t1639>Gatsby turned back to catch it with trembling fingers, then placed it back in its original position.</t1639> <t1640>After that, Gatsby sat down, stiff, elbows on the armrest, hands supporting his chin.</t1640>
<t1641>"I'm sorry about the watch," he said.</t1641>
<t1642>My face is now burning hot.</t1642> <t1643>I can't piece together a single coherent sentence from the thousands in my head.</t1643>
<t1644>"It's just a watch</t1644>
<t1645>"It's just old." I told them foolishly.</t1645>
<t1646>I think all of us for a moment believed that the clock had shattered into pieces on the floor.</t1646>
<t1647>"We haven't seen each other for many years." Daisy said, her voice sounding as if it were normal.</t1647>
<t1648>"November coming will be five years."</t1648>
<t1649>Gatsby's mechanical response made us fall into an awkward silence for another minute.</t1649> <t1650>I found an excuse for the two of them to stand up by suggesting they help me make tea in the kitchen, but at that moment, the possessed Finnish woman brought up the tea tray.</t1650>
<t1651>Thanks to bustling around with the tea cups and the cakes, everyone managed to regain their composure.</t1651> <t1652>While Daisy and I were chatting, Gatsby withdrew into silence, attentively watching one person after another with tense, sad eyes.</t1652> <t1653>However, tranquility was not the goal; as soon as I had the chance, I hastily excused myself and stood up.</t1653>
<t1654>"Where are you planning to go?" Gatsby asked, sounding worried.</t1654>
<t1655>"I will be right back."</t1655>
<t1656>"I want to talk to you about a few things before you go."</t1656>
<t1657>Gatsby took me into the kitchen, closed the door, and whispered:</t1657>
<t1658>"Oh my God!" his voice was despondent.</t1658>
<t1659>"What's going on?"</t1659>
<t1660>"This is a very wrong thing to do." Gatsby said, shaking his head back and forth. "A terrible, terrible mistake."</t1660>
<t1661>"Because you were too emotional, that's all." Luckily, I added, "Daisy was emotional too."</t1661>
<t1662>"Was she moved too?" Gatsby repeated my words skeptically.</t1662>
<t1663>"No different from you."</t1663>
<t1664>"Don't speak too loudly."</t1664>
<t1665>"You are acting like a child," I said impatiently. "Not only that, but you are also being rude."</t1665> <t1666>"Daisy is sitting out there all alone."</t1666>
<t1667>Gatsby raised his hand to stop me from speaking.</t1667> <t1668>He looked at me with an unforgettable look of shame, then carefully opened the door and went back to the living room.</t1668>
<t1669>I went out of the house through the back way, just as Gatsby had done about half an hour earlier when he was nervously pacing around the house.</t1669><t1670>I quickly ran to hide under a large, gnarled tree, whose lush foliage formed a rain shelter for me.</t1670><t1671>Then the sky poured rain down onto my rugged garden, which Gatsby's gardener had meticulously trimmed.</t1671><t1672>The lawn was now pockmarked with puddles and muddy patches, looking like prehistoric terrain.</t1672><t1673>Standing under the tree, there was nothing to look at except Gatsby's grand house, so I stared at it for half an hour, just like Kant gazing at his church steeple.</t1673><t1674>A bootlegger had built it a decade ago during the trend of constructing houses in classical architecture.</t1674><t1675>According to the story, he had agreed to pay property taxes for all the neighboring houses for five years if the owners would thatch their roofs.</t1675><t1676>Perhaps the refusal of these people had disappointed him to the point of losing interest in his project.</t1676><t1677>His health immediately deteriorated severely.</t1677><t1678>His descendants then sold the house while the mourning wreath was still hanging on the door.</t1678><t1679>Americans, while occasionally willing to bow down as slaves, are always stubbornly unwilling to be farmers.</t1679>
<t1680>About half an hour later, the sun began to shine again.</t1680> <t1681>The food delivery truck drove into Gatsby's yard to deliver goods for the cook to prepare dinner, but I was certain Gatsby wouldn't eat a spoonful.</t1681> <t1682>A maid began to open the windows on the upper floor of Gatsby's house, her figure flickering through each window, then she stepped to a large central window and calmly leaned out to spit into the garden below.</t1682> <t1683>It was time for me to go back inside.</t1683> <t1684>When it was still raining, the sound of the rain was like the murmur of the two of them, occasionally rising and echoing full of emotion.</t1684> <t1685>But now I felt a new silence, and this silence seemed to envelop the house.</t1685>
<t1686>I stepped into the house, trying every possible way to make noise in the kitchen, almost toppling the stove, but I believe they didn't hear anything.</t1686> <t1687>The two of them were sitting at opposite ends of the sofa, looking at each other as if they had asked or were still asking each other something, with all traces of awkwardness gone.</t1687> <t1688>Daisy's face was streaked with tears, and when she saw me enter, she stood up abruptly and began to wipe her tears with a handkerchief in front of the mirror.</t1688> <t1689>However, there was an astonishing change in Gatsby.</t1689> <t1690>He looked radiant, though he didn't say a word or make any joyful gesture, a bright happiness emanated from him, filling the entire room.</t1690>
<t1691>"Oh, hello old friend." Gatsby said as if he hadn't seen me for many years.</t1691> <t1692>For a moment, I even thought he would reach out to shake my hand.</t1692>
<t1693>"The rain has stopped."</t1693>
<t1694>"Is that so?" When Gatsby realized what I had just said, the cheerful, sparkling rays of sunlight were already dancing throughout the room.</t1694> <t1695>He smiled like a meteorologist, like an enthusiastic regular guest upon seeing the sunlight return.</t1695> <t1696>He repeated this news to Daisy.</t1696> <t1697>"What do you think?</t1697> <t1698>The rain has stopped."</t1698>
<t1699>"I'm very happy, Jay." Daisy's throat was filled with a poignant beauty just to express unexpected joys.</t1699>
<t1700>"I want to invite you and Daisy to visit my house," Gatsby said.</t1700> <t1701>"I want to take Daisy around the house."</t1701>
<t1702>"Do you really want me to leave?"</t1702>
<t1703>"Definitely want to, old friend."</t1703>
<t1704>Daisy went upstairs to wash her face while Gatsby and I stood waiting on the lawn.</t1704> <t1705>Too late, I felt embarrassed thinking about my face towels in the bathroom.</t1705>
<t1706>"My house looks very beautiful, doesn't it?" Gatsby asked.</t1706> <t1707>"Look, the entire facade is illuminated."</t1707>
<t1708>I agree the house is indeed magnificent.</t1708>
<t1709>"That's right." Gatsby's eyes glanced over the house, through each arched door to the square tower peak.</t1709> <t1710>"It only took me three years to make enough money to buy it."</t1710>
<t1711>"I thought your money was inherited?"</t1711>
<t1712>"That's right, old sport." Gatsby replied mechanically.</t1712> <t1713>"But I lost everything during the crisis, the war crisis."</t1713>
<t1714>I think he actually doesn't know what he's talking about, because when I asked him what his profession was, he answered "That's my personal business" before realizing that his answer was inappropriate.</t1714>
<t1715>"Oh, I have worked in many professions." Gatsby corrected.</t1715> <t1716>"I used to work in the pharmaceutical industry and then moved to the oil industry.</t1716> <t1717>But now I have left both." He looked at me more intently. "Are you implying that you are considering the proposal I made the other night?"</t1717>
<t1718>Before I could answer, Daisy had already stepped out of the house, the rows of brass buttons on her shirt sparkling under the sunlight.</t1718>
<t1719>"Is THAT the huge house?" Daisy exclaimed, pointing towards the house.</t1719>
<t1720>"Do you like it?"</t1720>
<t1721>"I like it but I don't understand how you can be there alone."</t1721>
<t1722>"You always invite interesting people to the house, day and night.</t1722> <t1723>People who have done remarkable things.</t1723> <t1724>Famous personalities."</t1724>
<t1725>Instead of taking a shortcut along the bay shore, we went out onto the road and then entered through the main gate.</t1725> <t1726>With a mesmerizing whisper, Daisy praised every feature of the house, which stood towering and casting its shadow against the sky.</t1726> <t1727>She admired the garden with the rich, sparkling scent of perennial daffodils, the sharp, effervescent aroma of hawthorn and plum blossoms, and the pale yellow fragrance of kiss-me-at-the-gate flowers.</t1727> <t1728>Strangely, as we approached the granite steps, we did not see the colorful dresses fluttering in and out of the door, nor did we hear any sound except for the chirping of birds on the branches.</t1728>
<t1729>As we entered the house and passed through the music rooms decorated in the style of Queen Marie Antoinette and the living rooms decorated in the English Renaissance style, I felt as if there were guests hiding behind each chair, behind each table, as if they were following orders to hold their breath and remain silent until we passed by.</t1729> <t1730>When Gatsby closed the door of the library room "the Merton College Library," I swear I heard the voice of the owl-eyed man let out a ghostly laugh.</t1730>
<t1731>We went upstairs, passing by bedrooms decorated in an old-fashioned style with pink silk, purple silk, and vibrantly displayed freshly picked flowers.</t1731> <t1732>Passing by the dressing rooms, billiard rooms, and bathrooms with sunken tubs, we inadvertently entered a room where a guest in pajamas with disheveled hair was performing liver exercises on the floor.</t1732> <t1733>It was Klipspringer, the "boarder."</t1733> <t1734>I had seen him wandering hungrily by the sea every morning.</t1734> <t1735>Finally, we reached Gatsby's private quarters, which included a bedroom, a bathroom, and a study decorated in the Adam style.</t1735> <t1736>We sat in the study and drank a glass of Chartreuse that Gatsby had just taken from a shelf on the wall.</t1736>
<t1737>Gatsby never took his eyes off Daisy; I think he was valuing everything in his house based on the reaction in her lovely eyes.</t1737> <t1738>Sometimes, he would also stare blankly at his possessions, as if in the very real and astonishing presence of Daisy, those things ceased to be real.</t1738> <t1739>Once, he almost fell down the stairs.</t1739>
<t1740>Compared to the other rooms, Gatsby's room was the simplest, except for the mirrored table with a gold-plated grooming set.</t1740> <t1741>Daisy delightedly picked up the comb and brushed her hair.</t1741> <t1742>At that moment, Gatsby sat down, covered his eyes with his hand, and burst out laughing.</t1742>
<t1743>"This is the funniest thing, old chap." Gatsby chuckled. "I can't...</t1743> <t1744>When I try..."</t1744>
<t1745>Gatsby clearly had gone through two stages and now he was entering the third stage.</t1745> <t1746>After awkwardness and then indescribable joy, he was now savoring the miraculous feeling of Daisy's presence.</t1746> <t1747>Gatsby had waited for this day for so long, dreamed about it, or one could say, waited for it with unimaginable tension.</t1747> <t1748>Yet now, when faced with it, he was like a broken clock wound too tight.</t1748>
<t1749>After a moment of composure, Gatsby opened</t1749>
<t1750>showed us two enormous wardrobes, inside which hung layer upon layer of suits, pajamas, and ties, while the shirts were neatly and orderly stacked on top of each other like dozens of bricks.</t1750>
<t1751>"I found someone in England to buy clothes for me.</t1751> <t1752>Every early spring and winter, he sends me all kinds of selected items."</t1752>
<t1753>Gatsby took out a stack of shirts and began throwing them down, one by one, in front of us.</t1753> <t1754>The shirts made of thin linen, thick silk, and fine flannel were crumpled as they were thrown down, covering the table in a mix of colors.</t1754> <t1755>While we were still admiring them, Gatsby brought out even more, piling them up into a high, smooth, colorful heap.</t1755> <t1756>Long-striped shirts, patterned stripes, checkered stripes in coral, light green, light purple, light orange, and light blue.</t1756> <t1757>Daisy suddenly let out a strange sound, then buried her face in the shirts and began to sob uncontrollably.</t1757>
<t1758>"Everything is so beautiful." Daisy sobbed, her voice choked in the thick folds.</t1758> <t1759>"It makes me sad because I've never seen such beautiful dresses before."</t1759>
<t1760>Behind the house, we planned to step outside to visit the garden, the swimming pool, the seaplane, and the flowers blooming in the middle of summer.</t1760> <t1761>However, outside the window, it started raining again, so we stood in a row looking out at the rippling water in the bay.</t1761>
<t1762>"If there were no fog, we could see your house across the bay." Gatsby said.</t1762> <t1763>"There is always a green light burning all night at the end of your dock."</t1763>
<t1764>Daisy suddenly linked her arm through Gatsby's, but he seemed to be lost in the words he had just spoken.</t1764> <t1765>Perhaps he had just realized that the great significance of the green light would forever vanish from now on.</t1765> <t1766>Compared to the vast distance separating him and Daisy, the green light seemed very close to her, almost within her reach.</t1766> <t1767>It was almost like a star near the moon.</t1767> <t1768>Now the green light shone again as it did every day.</t1768> <t1769>The things he had been passionately obsessed with every day now had one less.</t1769>
<t1770>I wandered aimlessly around the room, examining everything in the dim light.</t1770> <t1771>A picture of a middle-aged man in a sailor's outfit hanging on the wall, right above Gatsby's desk, caught my attention.</t1771>
<t1772>"Who is there?"</t1772>
<t1773>"That person? That's Mr. Dan Cody, my old friend."</t1773>
<t1774>The name sounds somewhat familiar to me.</t1774>
<t1775>"He has passed away."</t1775> <t1776>"Many years ago, he was a close friend of mine."</t1776>
<t1777>There was a small picture of Gatsby on the desk, also in a sailor's outfit.</t1777> <t1778>In the picture, Gatsby stood with his head tilted defiantly, probably taken when he was about eighteen years old.</t1778>
<t1779>"I really like this picture." Daisy exclaimed. "Slicked-back hair!</t1779> <t1780>You never told me you had slicked-back hair - or a yacht."</t1780>
<t1781>"Look here," Gatsby said swiftly. "There are many newspaper clippings about you here."</t1781>
<t1782>The two of them stood close together looking through the pieces of newspaper.</t1782> <t1783>I was about to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang, and Gatsby picked up the receiver.</t1783>
<t1784>"Alright... alright, I can't talk right now... I can't talk right now old friend... I said a SMALL town... he has to know what a small town is.</t1784> <t1785>Well, he's just useless to us if he thinks Detroit is a small town..."</t1785>
<t1786>He hung up.</t1786>
<t1787>"Get here QUICKLY!" Daisy shouted from the window.</t1787>
<t1788>The rain is still falling, but the darkness has lifted from the west.</t1788> <t1789>The fluffy clouds, tinged with pink and yellow, look like cotton pillows floating on the sea.</t1789>
<t1790>"Look." Daisy whispered, then continued after a moment: "I want to reach out and grab one of those pink clouds, put you on it, and push you everywhere."</t1790>
<t1791>I tried to say goodbye, but they pretended not to hear.</t1791> <t1792>Perhaps my presence made them feel more natural when being next to each other.</t1792>
<t1793>"I know what we should do." Gatsby said.</t1793> <t1794>"We will call Klipspringer to play the piano."</t1794>
<t1795>Gatsby stepped out of the room and called out "Ewing!", a few minutes later he returned with a young man who had a shy, tired demeanor, wearing tortoiseshell glasses and sparse blonde hair.</t1795> <t1796>This young man was now dressed in a neat sports coat, open-necked shirt, sports shoes, and dark-colored trousers.</t1796>
<t1797>"Did we disturb you while you were rehearsing?" Daisy asked politely.</t1797>
<t1798>"I was sleeping." Klipspringer said loudly, humbly ashamed.</t1798> <t1799>"Indeed, I was sleeping.</t1799> <t1800>Then I woke up..."</t1800>
<t1801>"Klipspringer, play the piano." Gatsby interrupted.</t1801> <t1802>"You can play, can't you, old sport?"</t1802>
<t1803>"I'm not very good at playing.</t1803> <t1804>I... hardly ever play.</t1804> <t1805>I haven't practiced in a long time..."</t1805>
<t1806>"Let's go downstairs." Gatsby interrupted.</t1806> <t1807>He raised his hand to turn off the light, the gray window frames seemed to disappear as the house filled with light.</t1807>
<t1808>In the music room, Gatsby turned on the solitary standing lamp beside the piano.</t1808> <t1809>He tremulously lit a cigarette for Daisy, then sat down next to her on a chair on the other side of the room, where the light couldn't reach, to complement the flickering light from the hallway that shone through the door onto the floor.</t1809>
<t1810>When Klipspringer finished playing The Love Nest, he turned around to look for Gatsby in the dim darkness, his face pained.</t1810>
<t1811>"You see, I haven't practiced for a long time.</t1811> <t1812>I told you I couldn't play.</t1812> <t1813>I haven't practiced for a long time..."</t1813>
<t1814>"Don't talk too much, old sport," Gatsby ordered.</t1814> <t1815>"Play on!"</t1815>
<t1816>"FROM EARLY MORNING</t1816>
<t1817>TO THE EVENING</t1817>
<t1818>ARE WE HAPPY?</t1818>
<t1819>Outside, the wind was blowing hard, and in the distance, the faint sound of thunder echoed from the bay.</t1819> <t1820>The houses in the village of West Egg had already lit up.</t1820> <t1821>The electric trains carrying people from New York were rushing through the rain.</t1821> <t1822>This was the moment of profound human change, and excitement began to spread through the air.</t1822>
<t1823>"THERE IS ONE THING CERTAIN - NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN"</t1823>
<t1824>The rich get richer, the poor have more children</t1824>
<t1825>IN THE MIDST OF IT, IN THE MIDST OF IT...</t1825>
<t1826>When I stepped up to say goodbye, I saw the look of confusion and bewilderment reappear on Gatsby's face, as if a slight doubt had just crossed his mind about the happiness he was experiencing.</t1826> <t1827>It had been five years, and surely there had been moments, even moments that afternoon, when Daisy had not been exactly as he had imagined her in his dreams.</t1827> <t1828>It was not Daisy's fault, but rather the immense, intense illusion that Gatsby had created.</t1828> <t1829>Gatsby had thrown himself into this illusion with a passionate creativity, each day adding to it, embellishing it with bright feathers that carried him away.</t1829> <t1830>No blaze or freshness could compare to what a man holds in the emptiness of his heart.</t1830>
<t1831>When I looked at him, Gatsby clearly adjusted his posture a bit.</t1831> <t1832>His hands tightly grasped Daisy's hands, and when Daisy whispered something in his ear, he turned to look at her with an expression full of emotion.</t1832> <t1833>I suppose that the deep, warm, and passionate voice had moved him more than anything else, no dream could be higher than it - it was an immortal song.</t1833>
<t1834>They both completely forgot about me.</t1834> <t1835>Although Daisy glanced up and waved at me, Gatsby seemed to have no idea who I was.</t1835> <t1836>I looked at them once more, and they looked back at me, distant, completely consumed by the intense vitality within them.</t1836> <t1837>Then I walked out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them behind.</t1837>
<t1838>Chapter 6</t1838>
<t1839>During this time, one morning, a young, eager journalist from New York knocked on Gatsby's door to ask if he had anything to declare.</t1839>
<t1840>"What needs to be declared?" Gatsby asked politely.</t1840>
<t1841>"Then anything that can be declared."</t1841>
<t1842>It took a bewildering five minutes afterwards to realize that this young reporter had overheard at the editorial office that Gatsby's name was related to something he was determined not to disclose, or perhaps he didn't know much about it himself.</t1842> <t1843>Taking advantage of his day off, with commendable initiative, he hurried to the place to "see what was going on."</t1843>
<t1844>This was just a random act, but it turned out that the young reporter's intuition was accurate.</t1844> <t1845>Gatsby's reputation was spread by the mouths of hundreds of people who had experienced his hospitality, and they became reliable sources for his past.</t1845> <t1846>This reputation grew throughout the summer, almost making him newsworthy. The contemporary anecdote about the 'tunnel leading to Canada' was associated with his name. There was also a persistent story that Gatsby did not live in his house but on a ship built like a house, which secretly moved up and down the coast of Long Island.</t1846> <t1847>Why these fabrications fascinated the young man James Gatz from North Dakota is hard to answer.</t1847>
<t1848>James Gatz, that was truly Gatsby's name, or at least the name on paper.</t1848> <t1849>He changed his name at the age of seventeen, at the very moment that marked the beginning of a career, the moment when he saw Dan Cody's yacht anchored in the hazardous shallows of Lake Superior. That afternoon, while wandering along the shore, he was still James Gatz, wearing a tattered blue shirt and canvas pants.</t1849> <t1850>But by the time he borrowed a boat and rowed out to the yacht TOULOMÊ, he had become Jay Gatsby.</t1850> <t1851>Jay Gatsby informed Cody that within half an hour, a strong wind would blow and it could capsize the yacht.</t1851>
<t1852>I believe that Gatsby had chosen this name for himself a long time ago.</t1852> <t1853>His parents were unsuccessful farmers who didn't know how to manage.</t1853> <t1854>In his imagination, Gatsby had never truly accepted them.</t1854>
<t1855>They are his parents.</t1855> <t1856>The truth is that the young man Jay Gatsby from the village of West Egg on Long Island was self-conceived through pure imagination.</t1856> <t1857>He is the son of God, in the truest sense of the word, so he must serve the work of the Father, serving a vast, superficial, and artificial beauty.</t1857> <t1858>Thus he created a Jay Gatsby, a kind of person that the mind of a seventeen-year-old boy could conceive, and he remained faithful to this concept until the end of his life.</t1858>
<t1859>For more than a year, Gatsby had to toil hard to make a living along the shores of Lake Superior by catching clams, fishing, or doing any job that could bring him food and shelter.</t1859> <t1860>Gatsby's sun-tanned, sturdy body became even more resilient through the arduous yet leisurely tasks he undertook to get by each day.</t1860> <t1861>Gatsby became acquainted with women very early, and because they spoiled him, he grew to despise them.</t1861> <t1862>He despised the virginal girls because they were so naive and foolish.</t1862> <t1863>He despised the other women because they were madly obsessed with things he considered ordinary.</t1863>
<t1864>However, Gatsby's heart had always been incessantly rebellious.</t1864> <t1865>The most ridiculous and bizarre fantasies always haunted him each night as he went to bed.</t1865> <t1866>Every night, when an indescribably gaudy and colorful world appeared in his mind, the clock on the washstand continued to tick, and the moonlight spread wet streaks over the scattered pieces of clothing on the floor.</t1866> <t1867>Each night, Gatsby added new strokes to his fantasies until they culminated in a splendid, colorful scene, then faded into dreamy oblivion as he gradually fell asleep.</t1867> <t1868>For a period of time, these fantasies provided him an escape for his imagination.</t1868> <t1869>They were a fitting reminder of impractical realities, a promise that shook the world, which had been firmly created on mythical wings.</t1869>
<t1870>A few months earlier, the premonition of a glorious future had led Gatsby to enroll at the small St. Olaf Lutheran school in southern Minnesota. After only two weeks, Gatsby became disheartened by the school's cruel indifference to the drumbeat of his destiny, or to what is generally called destiny, and by the contempt he faced for the janitorial work he did to make ends meet.</t1870> <t1871>Thus, Gatsby drifted to Lake Superior.</t1871> <t1872>On the day Dan Cody's yacht anchored in the shallow waters along the lake's shore, Gatsby had still not found anything for himself.</t1872>
<t1873>At that time Cody was fifty years old, he was a product of the silver mines in the state of Nevada, of the Yukon River, and of all the metal hunts since the year one thousand eight hundred seventy-five.</t1873> <t1874>The copper transactions in the state of Montana had turned him into a multimillionaire and gave him a strong body but a soft heart.</t1874> <t1875>Discovering this weakness, countless women tried to extract money from him.</t1875> <t1876>Among these women, none was as skillful as Ella Kaye, a female journalist.</t1876> <t1877>The story of her playing the role of Madame de Maintenon, exploiting his weakness and luring him on a yacht trip, was commonly seen in the newspapers of 1901.</t1877> <t1878>Cody had sailed along all the safe and gentle coastlines for about five years, until the day he changed the fate of the young man James Gatz at Little Girls Point.</t1878>
<t1879>For the young man James Gatz, who was then leaning on two oars looking up at the deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and allure of the world.</t1879> <t1880>I guess he smiled at Cody; he must have discovered that people would like him if he smiled at them.</t1880> <t1881>In any case, Cody asked him a few questions (one of which led to the birth of a brand new name) and discovered that this young man was very quick-witted and full of wild ambitions.</t1881> <t1882>A few days later, Cody took Gatsby to Duluth and bought him a new blue coat, six pristine white pants, and a sailor hat.</t1882> <t1883>So when the yacht TUOLOMEE set sail for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast, Gatsby went along.</t1883>
<t1884>Gatsby was hired to work on the yacht in an undefined position.</t1884> <t1885>During his time with Cody, he alternated between various tasks, from manager, assistant, navigator, secretary, and even overseer.</t1885> <t1886>A sober Dan Cody knew what a drunken Dan Cody would do with money, so he increasingly placed his trust in Gatsby.</t1886> <t1887>Such a life lasted for five years.</t1887> <t1888>During this time, the yacht circumnavigated the continent three times.</t1888> <t1889>The situation might have lasted even longer until one night when Ella Kaye boarded the ship in Boston.</t1889> <t1890>A week later, Dan Cody passed away.</t1890>
<t1891>I remember seeing Cody's portrait hanging in Gatsby's bedroom, a man with salt-and-pepper hair, a ruddy, stern, empty face, a man who roamed and explored, living a life of debauchery, who, in a certain era of American society, brought the savage brutality of brothels and frontier saloons to the eastern seaboard.</t1891> <t1892>It was Cody who indirectly caused Gatsby not to drink much.</t1892> <t1893>At the raucous parties, women would often pour alcohol over his hair because he had made it a habit not to drink.</t1893>
<t1894>Cody left a legacy for Gatsby - twenty-five thousand dollars.</t1894> <t1895>However, he never received it.</t1895> <t1896>Gatsby never understood what legal maneuver was used to prevent him from getting it, but all the remaining millions completely fell into the hands of Ella Kaye.</t1896> <t1897>Gatsby was left with only the capital of experience he had learned from Cody.</t1897> <t1898>From it, the vague characteristics of a young Jay Gatsby were solidified and developed into the real substance of a man.</t1898>
<t1899>It was much later that Gatsby told me this story.</t1899> <t1900>I write these things down here with the intention of dispelling the crazy rumors that have no truth about his past.</t1900> <t1901>Moreover, Gatsby told it to me at a time when I was still confused and bewildered, when I was in a place where I believed everything I heard about him, without exception.</t1901> <t1902>Therefore, I took advantage of this interruption, so to speak, when Gatsby was taking a break, to dispel all the misconceptions about him.</t1902>
<t1903>At that time, there was also a disruption in the connection between me and his life.</t1903> <t1904>For many weeks, I had neither seen nor heard him call.</t1904> <t1905>Mostly because I was in New York, busy hanging out with Jordan and trying to win over her elderly aunt.</t1905> <t1906>However, one Sunday afternoon, I finally dropped by Gatsby's house.</t1906> <t1907>I had been there for less than two minutes when someone brought Tom Buchanan into his house.</t1907> <t1908>Of course, I was extremely surprised, but the real surprise was that it had taken this long for it to happen.</t1908>
<t1909>There were three of them, all riding horses.</t1909> <t1910>Tom, along with a guy named Sloan and a beautiful woman dressed in brown riding attire, had been here before.</t1910>
<t1911>"Please come in." Gatsby stood on the porch and greeted.</t1911> <t1912>"I am very pleased to have everyone visit."</t1912>
<t1913>These people do not care about greetings.</t1913>
<t1914>"Please have a seat."</t1914> <t1915>"Please help yourself to a cigarette or a cigar." Gatsby quickly moved around the room, ringing a bell.</t1915> <t1916>"I will have someone bring up drinks right away."</t1916>
<t1917>Clearly, Gatsby had lost his composure significantly at Tom's appearance. He would continue to feel awkward until he could offer something to the guests, vaguely thinking that was the reason they came here.</t1917> <t1918>Mr. Sloan didn't want anything to drink.</t1918> <t1919>Lemonade?</t1919> <t1920>No, thank you. A little Champagne? None at all. Thank you, sorry....</t1920>
<t1921>"Did everyone have fun riding horses?"</t1921>
<t1922>"The roads here are quite good."</t1922>
<t1923>"I think that the cars..."</t1923>
<t1924>"Yes."</t1924>
<t1925>Unable to resist the urge, Gatsby turned to Tom, who had allowed himself to be introduced as someone who had never met before.</t1925>
<t1926>"Mr. Buchanan, I believe we have met somewhere before."</t1926>
<t1927>"Oh, that's right." Tom replied curtly but politely, clearly not remembering anything. "We did meet, I remember very well."</t1927>
<t1928>"About two weeks ago."</t1928>
<t1929>"Oh, that's right.</t1929> <t1930>Meeting you and Nick."</t1930>
<t1931>"I know your wife." Gatsby continued speaking almost aggressively.</t1931>
<t1932>"Is that so?"</t1932>
<t1933>Tom turned to me.</t1933>
<t1934>"Do you live nearby, Nick?"</t1934>
<t1935>"The house next door."</t1935>
<t1936>"Really?"</t1936>
<t1937>Sloane did not participate in the conversation, but lay back in his chair with an arrogant demeanor.</t1937> <t1938>The other woman also did not say anything until her second glass of whiskey soda, when she suddenly spoke up in a friendly manner.</t1938> <t1939>She said:</t1939>
<t1940>"We will all be attending your next party, Mr. Gatsby.</t1940> <t1941>What do you think?"</t1941>
<t1942>"Certainly, I would be very happy if everyone came to attend."</t1942>
<t1943>"Precious." Sloan said but did not seem appreciative.</t1943> <t1944>"Let's just go home."</t1944>
<t1945>"No need to hurry." Gatsby pleaded.</t1945> <t1946>He had regained his composure and wanted to face Tom a bit longer. "Or - Or why don't you all stay for dinner.</t1946> <t1947>Surely someone will drop by from New York."</t1947>
<t1948>"How about you come have a meal at MY house? Both of you." the woman invited eagerly.</t1948>
<t1949>This invitation includes inviting me as well.</t1949> <t1950>Sloan stood up.</t1950>
<t1951>"Then let's go." He said, but the words were meant only for the woman.</t1951>
<t1952>"I truly mean it." The woman pleaded.</t1952> <t1953>"I am very glad you came to my house.</t1953> <t1954>My house is very spacious."</t1954>
<t1955>Gatsby looked at me inquiringly.</t1955> <t1956>He wanted to go, but he didn't realize that Sloan was insistent on not wanting him to go.</t1956>
<t1957>"I'm afraid I can't go." I replied.</t1957>
<t1958>"If that's the case, then you go." The woman pleaded, focusing intently on Gatsby.</t1958>
<t1959>The guy Sloan whispered something into the woman's ear.</t1959>
<t1960>"If we don't leave now, we will be late." She insisted.</t1960>
<t1961>"I haven't bought a horse yet." Gatsby said.</t1961> <t1962>"When I was in the army, I also rode horses, but I never bought one for myself.</t1962> <t1963>I'll have to drive behind you all.</t1963> <t1964>Give me a few minutes to get ready."</t1964>
<t1965>We all stepped out onto the porch, Sloan and the woman k</t1965>
<t1966>pulled each other aside and talked animatedly.</t1966>
<t1967>"Oh my God, I believe he will go," Tom said.</t1967> <t1968>"Doesn't he know she doesn't want him to follow her?"</t1968>
<t1969>"But she said she wanted him to attend."</t1969>
<t1970>"She threw a very large party and he wouldn't know a single soul there." Tom frowned.</t1970> <t1971>"I wonder where this guy ever met Daisy in the first place."</t1971> <t1972>For God's sake, I might be an old-fashioned person, but the type of women who socialize a lot these days don't suit me.</t1972> <t1973>They know all kinds of people."</t1973>
<t1974>Suddenly, Sloan and the woman stepped down the stairs and mounted their horses.</t1974>
<t1975>"Let's go." Sloan said to Tom. "We are late."</t1975> <t1976>"We have to go now." Then he turned to me.</t1976> <t1977>"Could you please tell him that we can't wait, okay?"</t1977>
<t1978>Tom and I shook hands in greeting, while the other two and I merely nodded at each other coldly.</t1978> <t1979>After that, they rode their horses out onto the road, disappearing under the August foliage, just as Gatsby stepped out the door holding his hat and coat.</t1979>
<t1980>Tom clearly began to fear Daisy going out alone frequently, because the following Saturday night he went with his wife to attend a party at Gatsby's house.</t1980> <t1981>Perhaps his presence gave that evening a stifling atmosphere that made my memory of it stand out more than all the other parties that summer.</t1981> <t1982>It was still the usual guests, or at least the same type of people.</t1982> <t1983>There was still an abundance of champagne, the same colors, the usual chaotic noise, yet I felt an unease in the air, a sharpness spreading that had never been there before.</t1983> <t1984>Or perhaps because I had become familiar with it, had come to accept West Egg as a complete world with its own rules, with its own notable characters, not inferior to anywhere else because it did not feel inferior.</t1984> <t1985>Now I saw it again through Daisy's eyes.</t1985> <t1986>There is nothing sadder than seeing through new eyes what you have used all your strength to perfect.</t1986>
<t1987>They arrived at twilight, and while we were strolling among hundreds of excited guests, Daisy's voice emerged, gurgling in a whisper from her throat.</t1987>
<t1988>"The things here make me so excited."</t1988> <t1989>Daisy whispered.</t1989>
<t1990>"If you want to kiss me at any time tonight, Nick, just let me know and I'll arrange it for you.</t1990> <t1991>Just call my name, or show the green card.</t1991> <t1992>Now I'm giving you the green card...."</t1992>
<t1993>"Look around here." Gatsby suggested.</t1993>
<t1994>"I'm looking."</t1994> <t1995>"I see, it's wonderful...."</t1995>
<t1996>"You will see many faces of famous people you have heard of."</t1996>
<t1997>Tom's haughty, arrogant eyes swept over the crowd.</t1997>
<t1998>"We don't travel much." Tom said. "In fact, I don't know anyone here."</t1998>
<t1999>"Maybe you know her." Gatsby pointed to a woman, more dazzling and beautiful like an orchid than a person, sitting motionless under the white plum tree.</t1999> <t2000>Tom and Daisy stared with a different feeling that one gets when recognizing a famous character from the movies whom they have never met before.</t2000>
<t2001>"She is so beautiful." Daisy said.</t2001>
<t2002>"The person bending down next to her is the director,"</t2002>
<t2003>Gatsby stylishly introduced them to each group one by one.</t2003>
<t2004>"Mrs. Buchanan...</t2004> <t2005>Mr. Buchanan..."After a moment of hesitation, he added.</t2005> <t2006>"The house plays polo."</t2006>
<t2007>"Oh, no, it's not me," Tom protested.</t2007>
<t2008>However, it was clear that such an introduction pleased Gatsby, because Tom continued to be introduced as the polo player for the rest of the evening.</t2008>
<t2009>"I have never met so many famous people before." Daisy declared. "I like that man, what is his name again?</t2009> <t2010>The man with the nose that looks like it's blue."</t2010>
<t2011>Gatsby introduced the man's name, adding that he was a small producer.</t2011>
<t2012>"I still like him."</t2012>
<t2013>"I don't want to be a polo goalie anymore.</t2013> <t2014>I'd rather sit and watch all the famous people and let myself fade into oblivion." Tom joked.</t2014>
<t2015>Daisy and Gatsby stepped out to dance.</t2015> <t2016>I remember being surprised by his elegant classical style in the fox-trot.</t2016> <t2017>Before that, I had never seen him dance.</t2017> <t2018>Afterwards, the two of them wandered over to my house and sat on the steps for about half an hour while I was assigned by Daisy to keep watch in the garden "in case of fire, flood, or disaster," Daisy explained.</t2018>
<t2019>Tom appeared from 'oblivion' while we were sitting and eating. "Do you mind if I go over and eat with those people over there?"</t2019> <t2020>"That guy over there is really funny," Tom asked.</t2020>
<t2021>"You just go." Daisy replied kindly.</t2021> <t2022>"If you need to write down someone's address, use this gold pencil of mine." Daisy looked around for a moment and told me that the girl over there "isn't anything special but is pretty." I was certain that except for the half hour she spent alone with Gatsby, Daisy didn't find much joy in anything.</t2022>
<t2023>We were sitting at a table where everyone was already quite tipsy.</t2023> <t2024>That was also my fault.</t2024> <t2025>Gatsby was busy talking on the phone, while I preferred to chat with people I had met two weeks before.</t2025> <t2026>However, what I thought would make me happy ended up polluting the atmosphere.</t2026>
<t2027>"How are you, Ms. Baedeker?"</t2027>
<t2028>The young woman I greeted was trying to lean on my shoulder, but she couldn't.</t2028> <t2029>Hearing my greeting, she sat up, opening her eyes wide.</t2029>
<t2030>"What?"</t2030>
<t2031>A large and sluggish woman, who had once urged Daisy to play golf with her at a club the next day, spoke up in defense of Miss Baedeker.</t2031>
<t2032>"Oh, she's fine.</t2032> <t2033>When she drinks five or six cocktails, she always screams like that.</t2033> <t2034>I've told her not to touch alcohol anymore."</t2034>
<t2035>"I didn't touch anything." The recently defended person asserted with a slurred voice.</t2035>
<t2036>"I heard you shouting, so I spoke to Dr. Civet here.</t2036> <t2037>"Someone needs your help, doctor."</t2037>
<t2038>"I'm sure she was very appreciative." Another friend said, but there was no sign of gratitude.</t2038> <t2039>"However, he got her clothes all wet when he dunked her head into the lake."</t2039>
<t2040>"What I hate the most is being dunked in the pool.</t2040> <t2041>There was a time when people almost drowned me in New Jersey."</t2041>
<t2042>"If that's the case, then don't touch alcohol anymore." Dr. Civet attacked.</t2042>
<t2043>"Look at yourself." Ms. Baedeker shouted fiercely. "Your hands are shaking all over.</t2043> <t2044>I wouldn't dare let you operate on me."</t2044>
<t2045>Roughly speaking, that's how it was.</t2045> <t2046>Almost the last thing I remember is standing next to Daisy, watching the film director and his movie star.</t2046> <t2047>The two of them were still sitting under the white plum tree, their faces close together, separated only by a thin layer of pale moonlight.</t2047> <t2048>I suddenly realized that the whole evening he had been slowly and gradually leaning towards her to achieve this close distance.</t2048> <t2049>While observing, I saw him lean down one final time and then kiss her on the cheek.</t2049>
<t2050>"I like her."</t2050> <t2051>"She is very beautiful," Daisy said.</t2051>
<t2052>However, everything else made Daisy inexplicably uncomfortable and annoyed, not because of attitude or gestures, but because of a feeling.</t2052> <t2053>Daisy was terrified by West Egg, a place like no other, created by the Broadway society from a fishing village on Long Island.</t2053> <t2054>Daisy was frightened by its crude and rustic vitality that provoked people through distorted ancient words, and by the overly offensive circumstances that drove its inhabitants along a shortcut from nowhere to nowhere.</t2054> <t2055>Daisy saw terrifying and disgusting points in the simple and rustic life that she could not understand.</t2055>
<t2056>I sat on the front steps with Tom and Daisy for a while as they waited for their car.</t2056> <t2057>The front of the house was very dark, with only about ten yards of light cast from the doorway into the darkness.</t2057> <t2058>Occasionally, a moving shadow would be cast on the curtain in the upstairs dressing room, replaced by another shadow, the process of changing shadows continuing for those who came to powder themselves before an invisible mirror.</t2058>
<t2059>"Who is this Gatsby?" Tom suddenly asked.</t2059> <t2060>"Is he some kind of bootlegger?"</t2060>
<t2061>"Where did you hear that?" I probed.</t2061>
<t2062>"I didn't hear it anywhere.</t2062> <t2063>I just imagined it.</t2063> <t2064>There are many people who have recently become wealthy who are smugglers, you know."</t2064>
<t2065>"Not Gatsby." I said briefly.</t2065>
<t2066>Tom was silent for a moment.</t2066> <t2067>The pebbles on the road crunched under his feet.</t2067>
<t2068>"Then he must have struggled a lot to be able to gather the animals in this circus troupe."</t2068>
<t2069>A gentle breeze blew away the gray dust covering the fur collar of Daisy.</t2069>
<t2070>"At least they ought to be more interesting than the people we know." Daisy tried to say.</t2070>
<t2071>"But you don't seem to be enjoying it at all."</t2071>
<t2072>"Actually, I do."</t2072>
<t2073>Tom burst out laughing and turned to me.</t2073>
<t2074>"Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to stand under the cold water?"</t2074>
<t2075>Daisy began to softly sing a tune with a deep, rhythmic voice that brought out the meaning of each lyric, as it had never done before and would never do again.</t2075> <t2076>When the note rose high, her voice soared with it, breaking sweetly in perfect harmony like those of contralto singers.</t2076> <t2077>Each time she changed her voice like that, she poured a bit of warm, enchanting humanity into the space.</t2077>
<t2078>"There are many people who weren't invited but still came." Daisy suddenly said.</t2078> <t2079>"That girl wasn't invited either.</t2079> <t2080>They just came on their own and he was too polite to object."</t2080>
<t2081>"He wants to know who he is and what he does." Tom was determined to find out.</t2081> <t2082>"And he is determined to get the answer."</t2082>
<t2083>"You can tell me right now," Daisy replied.</t2083> <t2084>"He owns several pharmacies, to be precise, a lot of pharmacies.</t2084> <t2085>He built them from scratch with his own hands."</t2085>
<t2086>The limousine, arriving late, rolled into the yard.</t2086>
<t2087>"Goodbye, Nick." Daisy said.</t2087>
<t2088>Daisy's eyes left me to look up at the highest steps illuminated by bright lights, where the open door echoed the melancholic music of the song THREE O'CLOCK IN</t2088>
<t2089>THE MORNING. Finally, in Gatsby's naturally unceremonious party, there was a touch of romance, something entirely absent in her world.</t2089> <t2090>Was there something in the high music that seemed to be inviting Daisy to return?</t2090> <t2091>What would happen in those unforeseen dark moments?</t2091> <t2092>Perhaps a guest would unexpectedly arrive late, an extraordinarily rare person, a young, dazzling girl with a fresh glance at Gatsby, a magical moment of encounter that would erase those five years of devoted fidelity.</t2092>
<t2093>That night I stayed late.</t2093> <t2094>Gatsby asked me to stay until he was free.</t2094> <t2095>I lingered in the garden until the familiar groups of daily bathers had all run up from the dark, chilly beach, exhilarated, and until the lights in the guest bedrooms had been turned off.</t2095> <t2096>Finally, Gatsby stepped down the stairs, his unusually taut tanned skin on his face, his eyes bright but weary.</t2096>
<t2097>"She doesn't like it." Gatsby said immediately</t2097>
<t2098>"Of course I like it."</t2098>
<t2099>"She doesn't like it." Gatsby asserted.</t2099> <t2100>"She is not very happy."</t2100>
<t2101>Gatsby became silent, I guessed he was experiencing an unspeakable despondency.</t2101>
<t2102>"I feel very distant from her," Gatsby said. "It's hard to make her understand."</t2102>
<t2103>"Do you mean the dance performance?"</t2103>
<t2104>"The dance parties?" Gatsby dismissed all the dance parties he had organized with just a snap of his fingers.</t2104> <t2105>"Old sport, the dance parties aren't what matter."</t2105>
<t2106>Gatsby wanted nothing more than for Daisy to say to Tom: "I never loved you." After Daisy erased four years with Tom with that statement, the two of them would be able to come to a decision to resolve matters satisfactorily.</t2106> <t2107>One of those resolutions was that, once she was free, she would return to Louisville and get married again from her own home, just as she had five years earlier.</t2107>
<t2108>"She doesn't understand.</t2108> <t2109>She used to understand before.</t2109> <t2110>We used to sit together for many hours..."</t2110>
<t2111>Gatsby was silent, then paced back and forth on the desolate ground littered with fruit peels and crushed flower branches.</t2111>
<t2112>"If it were me, I wouldn't ask too much of Daisy." I ventured.</t2112> <t2113>"You can't repeat the past."</t2113>
<t2114>"Can't repeat the past?" Gatsby exclaimed incredulously.</t2114> <t2115>"Of course you can."</t2115>
<t2116>Gatsby looked around himself in a bewildered manner, as if the past were lurking somewhere in the shadows of the house, just out of his reach.</t2116>
<t2117>"I will straighten everything out and make them like they were in the past." Gatsby nodded firmly and said resolutely.</t2117> <t2118>"She will see."</t2118>
<t2119>Gatsby talked a lot about the past, I realized he seemed to be trying to find something, perhaps thoughts for himself, things he had lost since loving Daisy. His life had become confused and chaotic since then, if he could go back to some starting point in the past and let it pass by slowly, he might discover what that something was........</t2119> <t2120>One autumn night five years ago, the two of them walked side by side on the street under the falling leaves.</t2120> <t2121>They walked to a place without trees and the whole sidewalk lit up under the moonlight.</t2121> <t2122>They stopped there facing each other.</t2122> <t2123>The cool evening contained mysterious stirrings that came only twice a year at the change of seasons.</t2123> <t2124>The gentle light from the houses softly spread out into the darkness, and there was something like a tremor, like a stir among the stars.</t2124> <t2125>Out of the corner of his eye, Gatsby saw the paving stones of the sidewalk shifting, stacking up to form a ladder reaching to some secret place atop the trees.</t2125> <t2126>If he were alone, he could climb it.</t2126> <t2127>Once at the top, he could suck on the nipple of life and gulp down great draughts of its incomparable milk.</t2127>
<t2128>Gatsby's heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's pale face drew closer to his.</t2128> <t2129>Gatsby knew that when he kissed this girl, the ineffable visions he had would forever be entwined with her perishable breath.</t2129> <t2130>His mind would never be as serene as the mind of God.</t2130> <t2131>So he paused, waiting, listening a little longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star.</t2131> <t2132>And then he kissed Daisy.</t2132> <t2133>At the touch of his lips, Daisy blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.</t2133>
<t2134>Through everything Gatsby said, even through his sentimental and mawkish nature, it naturally reminded me of something - like a forgotten rhythm or a few words in a sentence I had heard from long ago.</t2134> <t2135>For a moment, these words began to form in my mouth and my lips parted like an idiot, as if struggling with them rather than a trembling breath.</t2135> <t2136>Yet they made no sound, and what I almost remembered was never spoken.</t2136>
<t2137>Chapter 7</t2137>
<t2138>While the curiosity about Gatsby was reaching its peak, one Saturday evening the lights in his house suddenly did not turn on anymore, and his career, like Trimalchio's, became as obscure as it was in the beginning.</t2138> <t2139>Gradually, I realized that the cars that unexpectedly turned into his driveway only stayed for about a minute before gloomily turning away in disappointment.</t2139> <t2140>Wondering if he was ill, I went over to inquire, and a strange but fierce-looking butler glanced at me suspiciously from the door.</t2140>
<t2141>"Is Mr. Gatsby sick?"</t2141>
<t2142>"No." After a brief pause, he reluctantly added the words "Sir" in a resentful tone.</t2142>
<t2143>"Lately, I haven't seen him, so I feel a bit worried.</t2143> <t2144>Please tell Mr. Carraway to come visit."</t2144>
<t2145>"Who?" he asked rudely.</t2145>
<t2146>"Carraway."</t2146>
<t2147>"Carraway."</t2147> <t2148>"Alright. I will leave a message." He abruptly slammed the door shut.</t2148>
<t2149>My Finnish housekeeper informed me that about a week ago, Gatsby had fired all the household staff and replaced them with about a dozen others.</t2149> <t2150>These people had never been to West Egg before, so the delivery men found it difficult to bribe or persuade them.</t2150> <t2151>They ordered a lot of food over the phone.</t2151> <t2152>The delivery boy reported that the kitchen now looked like a pigsty, and others in the village agreed that not all of these new workers were actually household staff.</t2152>
<t2153>The next day Gatsby called me on the phone</t2153>
<t2154>"Are you going far?" I asked.</t2154>
<t2155>"It's not like that, old friend."</t2155>
<t2156>"I heard that you fired all the helpers."</t2156>
<t2157>"I want to hire people who don't make much fuss."</t2157> <t2158>"Daisy comes here often, in the afternoons."</t2158>
<t2159>So that's how it is, the entire boarding house collapsed like a house built of cards just because of the displeased look from the beautiful woman.</t2159>
<t2160>"They are the people whom Wolfsheim wants to help.</t2160> <t2161>All of them are siblings, who used to run a small hotel."</t2161>
<t2162>"Is that so."</t2162>
<t2163>Gatsby called me, at Daisy's request, asking if I wanted to come to Daisy's house the next day.</t2163> <t2164>Baker would also be there.</t2164> <t2165>Half an hour later, Daisy herself called to invite me and felt reassured knowing that I would visit.</t2165> <t2166>I guessed something was up, but I couldn't believe they would choose this time to cause trouble, especially the kind of trouble Gatsby had outlined to me while we were in the garden.</t2166>
<t2167>The next day was scorching hot, perhaps the last and hottest day of summer.</t2167> <t2168>When my train passed through the tunnel into the light, there was nothing but the scorching whistles of the National Biscuit Company shattering the sweltering, silent atmosphere.</t2168> <t2169>The straw-stuffed seats in the carriage seemed almost ready to catch fire.</t2169> <t2170>The woman sitting next to me was drenched in sweat around her white shirt, and then, when the pages of the newspaper she was reading became damp under her fingers, she let out a sigh amidst the oppressive heat.</t2170> <t2171>Her notebook fell with a thud to the floor of the train.</t2171>
<t2172>"Oh, my God".</t2172> <t2173>She cried out, almost out of breath.</t2173>
<t2174>I wearily bent down to pick up the notebook and handed it back to her, holding it slightly by the corner and keeping an arm's length distance to show that I had no ill intentions, yet the people around, including the woman, looked at me with suspicion.</t2174>
<t2175>"It's so hot!" The ticket inspector said to the familiar faces.</t2175> <t2176>"Why is it so hot, hot! hot! hot!</t2176> <t2177>Isn't it hot enough already?</t2177> <t2178>It's so hot, isn't it? Isn't it...?"</t2178>
<t2179>My train ticket was returned with his dirty fingerprints on it.</t2179> <t2180>In this dreadful heat, who cares to notice which rosy lips they have kissed or whose head is drenched on their pajama chest pocket.</t2180>
<t2181>....</t2181> <t2182>A cool breeze blew through the Buchanan's front hall, carrying the sound of a ringing phone to where Gatsby and I were standing, waiting at the door.</t2182>
<t2183>The butler shouted loudly into the receiver.</t2183> <t2184>"I'm sorry, madam, but we can't get it done - this afternoon is unbearably hot and we can't touch it."</t2184>
<t2185>Actually, what he said was just: "Yes... yes... let me see."</t2185>
<t2186>He put down the receiver and came out to meet us, taking our stiff straw hats.</t2186>
<t2187>"The hostess is waiting for you two inside!" he shouted without bothering to point the way.</t2187> <t2188>In this terrible heat, making any additional gesture is an insult to everyone's reserve of vitality.</t2188>
<t2189>The room was shaded by canvas awnings, making it somewhat dark and cool.</t2189> <t2190>Daisy and Jordan were lying on a huge couch, looking like two silver idols resting on their white dresses to keep them from being blown away by the gentle breeze of the fans.</t2190>
<t2191>"We can't move." Both of them spoke at once.</t2191>
<t2192>The fingers, powdered white on Jordan's sun-tanned skin, pressed lightly against my fingers</t2192>
<t2193>"And where is the athlete Thomas Buchanan?" I asked.</t2193>
<t2194>Right then I heard Tom's voice, rough and rude, hoarse and raspy, talking on the phone in the h</t2194>
<t2195>hallway.</t2195>
<t2196>Gatsby stood right in the middle of the deep red carpet, gazing around with passionate eyes.</t2196> <t2197>Daisy looked at him and burst into laughter, a sound full of sweet joy.</t2197> <t2198>A bit of powder dust from her chest floated up into the air.</t2198>
<t2199>"According to the rumors," Jordan whispered, "the person on the phone is Tom's mistress."</t2199>
<t2200>We were all silent.</t2200> <t2201>The voice from the hallway rose louder, full of irritation.</t2201> <t2202>"If that's the case, I won't sell you the car anymore.</t2202> <t2203>I'm not obligated to sell it to you...</t2203> <t2204>Regarding you calling and disturbing me during lunch like this, I can't tolerate it."</t2204>
<t2205>"Then put the receiver down." Daisy said suspiciously.</t2205>
<t2206>"No, he doesn't have it." I reassured her.</t2206> <t2207>"This is an honest business.</t2207> <t2208>I happened to know about this."</t2208>
<t2209>Tom opened the door and walked in. For a moment, his large frame blocked the entire doorway, then he hurried into the room</t2209><t2210>.</t2210>
<t2211>"Hello Gatsby!" Tom extended his broad hand in greeting, skillfully masking his disdain. "I am pleased to meet you, sir....</t2211> <t2212>Hello Nick."</t2212>
<t2213>"Make everyone a cold drink." Daisy said loudly.</t2213>
<t2214>When Tom left the room, Daisy stood up, walked over to Gatsby, pulled his face down, and kissed him on the lips.</t2214>
<t2215>"You know I love you, don't you." Daisy whispered.</t2215>
<t2216>"You forget that there is a woman present here." Jordan said.</t2216>
<t2217>Daisy looked around with a doubtful expression.</t2217>
<t2218>"I also kissed Nick."</t2218>
<t2219>"Indeed, she is such a lowly and vulgar girl."</t2219>
<t2220>"You are so reckless!" Daisy shouted, standing in front of the brick fireplace.</t2220> <t2221>Then suddenly remembering the heat, Daisy sat back down regretfully just as a neatly dressed nanny led a little girl into the room.</t2221>
<t2222>"Mommy's little girl." Daisy cuddled and hugged her daughter.</t2222> <t2223>"Come here, let mommy love you."</t2223>
<t2224>The child left the nanny's hand, dashed across the room, and then shyly nestled into its mother's clothes.</t2224>
<t2225>"Mommy's darling! Have I sprinkled powder on your golden hair yet?</t2225> <t2226>Stand up, say hello to the guests."</t2226>
<t2227>Gatsby and I bent down to take the child's small, timid hand.</t2227> <t2228>After that, he kept looking at the child with a look of surprise.</t2228> <t2229>I suppose he had never really thought that the child actually existed.</t2229>
<t2230>"I already changed my clothes before lunch." The child hurriedly turned back and said to the mother.</t2230>
<t2231>"Because mommy wants to show you off." Daisy's face lowered, burying into the small, white, chubby neck of her child. "My baby.</t2231> <t2232>You are truly as beautiful as a dream."</t2232>
<t2233>"Yes." The child answered softly and gently. "Aunt Jordan is also wearing a white dress."</t2233>
<t2234>"Do you like Mommy's friends?" Daisy turned around to face Gatsby.</t2234> <t2235>"Do you think they are pretty?"</t2235>
<t2236>"Where's Dad?"</t2236>
<t2237>"The girl doesn't look like her father," Daisy explained.</t2237> <t2238>"She looks like me.</t2238> <t2239>She looks like me in her hair and face."</t2239>
<t2240>Daisy sat down on the chair.</t2240> <t2241>The nanny stepped forward and reached out to take the baby.</t2241>
<t2242>"Come here, Pammy."</t2242>
<t2243>"Hello, my dear daughter!"</t2243>
<t2244>With a regretful glance back, the obedient child took the nanny's hand and was pulled out of the door just as Tom returned with four glasses of gin and tonic filled with clinking ice cubes.</t2244>
<t2245>Gatsby took his glass of wine.</t2245>
<t2246>"It looks cool." Gatsby said, his demeanor clearly showing tension.</t2246>
<t2247>We gulped down long sips.</t2247>
<t2248>"I once read somewhere that each year the sun becomes hotter." Tom said intimately.</t2248> <t2249>"So sooner or later the earth will fall into the sun - wait - it seems to be the opposite - the sun becomes colder each year."</t2249>
<t2250>"Come here." Tom suggested to Gatsby.</t2250> <t2251>"I want you to come out and see this."</t2251>
<t2252>I went with them out into the hallway.</t2252> <t2253>Outside, the green strait's water seemed stagnant in the heat, a small sailboat slowly gliding towards the refreshing open sea.</t2253> <t2254>Gatsby watched the sail for a moment, then he raised his hand to point across the bay.</t2254>
<t2255>"My house is across from your house on the other side."</t2255>
<t2256>"Is that so."</t2256>
<t2257>Our eyes glanced over the rose beds, across the blazing lawn, and the grass accustomed to summer heat growing along the water's edge.</t2257> <t2258>The white sails of the boat moved slowly towards the cool boundary of the sky.</t2258> <t2259>Ahead was the shell-shaped ocean and the fortunate islands.</t2259>
<t2260>"It's an interesting sport," Tom nodded and said.</t2260> <t2261>"I want to go out there and play with it for about an hour."</t2261>
<t2262>We had lunch in the dining room, which had been darkened to escape the heat, and drank away our joy and restlessness with cold beers.</t2262>
<t2263>"What should we do this afternoon to pass the time?" Daisy said loudly.</t2263> <t2264>"And then the day after that, and the next thirty years."</t2264>
<t2265>"Don't think in such an unhealthy way," Jordan said.</t2265> <t2266>"Life will start anew when the cool autumn arrives."</t2266>
<t2267>"But now it's too hot." Daisy continued, her eyes looking like she was about to cry.</t2267> <t2268>"And everything seems so confusing and mixed up.</t2268> <t2269>Let's go downtown."</t2269>
<t2270>Daisy's voice seemed to be struggling with the heat, as if beating it, molding its insensitivity into shapes.</t2270>
<t2271>"I heard that people use horse stables to make garages." At that moment, Tom was talking to Gatsby.</t2271> <t2272>"But I am the first person to use a garage as a horse stable."</t2272>
<t2273>"Does anyone want to go out to the street?" Daisy kept asking, not giving up on the idea.</t2273> <t2274>Gatsby's eyes lazily drifted towards Daisy. "Ah," Daisy shouted.</t2274> <t2275>"You look so cool,"</t2275>
<t2276>Their eyes met and then they gazed at each other passionately as if in this space only the two of them existed.</t2276> <t2277>With an effort, Daisy averted her gaze and looked down at the table.</t2277>
<t2278>"You look so cool." Daisy repeated.</t2278>
<t2279>Daisy's demeanor revealed to Gatsby that she loved him.</t2279> <t2280>Tom witnessed everything.</t2280> <t2281>He became stunned, mouth agape, looking from Gatsby to Daisy as if he had just realized she was someone he had known long ago.</t2281>
<t2282>"You look like someone in an advertisement," Daisy continued to say unintentionally.</t2282> <t2283>"Do you know the advertisement of that guy....."</t2283>
<t2284>"Alright." Tom quickly interrupted.</t2284> <t2285>"I really want to go out to the street too.</t2285> <t2286>Let's go, all of us together."</t2286>
<t2287>Tom stood up, his eyes flashing as he looked back and forth between Gatsby and his wife.</t2287> <t2288>No one moved.</t2288>
<t2289>"Let's go." Tom started to get angry.</t2289> <t2290>"What's going on here?"</t2290> <t2291>"If you want to go downtown, then let's go right away."</t2291>
<t2292>Tom's hand, trembling with the effort of self-control, lifted the glass to his lips and drained the last drops of beer.</t2292> <t2293>Daisy's voice compelled us to stand up and walk out onto the gravel path under the blazing sun.</t2293>
<t2294>"Are we just going to go like this?" Daisy objected.</t2294> <t2295>"Not letting anyone smoke a cigarette at all?"</t2295>
<t2296>"Everyone has already smoked throughout lunch."</t2296>
<t2297>"Come on, let's go out and have some fun." Daisy pleaded with her husband.</t2297> <t2298>"It's already so hot, why get worked up?" Tom didn't answer.</t2298>
<t2299>"Well, then it's up to you." Daisy said.</t2299> <t2300>"Let's go, Jordan."</t2300>
<t2301>Two women went upstairs to change clothes while three men continued to stand there, shuffling the hot pebbles beneath their feet.</t2301> <t2302>A crescent silver moon hung suspended in the western sky.</t2302> <t2303>Gatsby intended to speak, then changed his mind, but Tom had already turned around and was looking directly at him with an expectant expression.</t2303> <t2304>Gatsby reluctantly asked.</t2304>
<t2305>"Is your stable here</t2305><t2306>?"</t2306>
<t2307>"At the end of the road about a quarter of a mile away."</t2307>
<t2308>"Is that so."</t2308>
<t2309>Silence.</t2309>
<t2310>"I don't understand why we have to go downtown." Tom blurted out sharply.</t2310> <t2311>"Women always come up with silly things."</t2311>
<t2312>"Should I bring something to drink?" Daisy called down from the window.</t2312>
<t2313>"I'll go get some whiskey." Tom replied and then stepped into the house.</t2313>
<t2314>Gatsby turned to me with a stiff demeanor.</t2314>
<t2315>"In this house, I can't say anything, old friend"</t2315>
<t2316>"Daisy has a careless, imprudent voice." I remarked.</t2316> <t2317>"Daisy's voice is full of..." I hesitated.</t2317>
<t2318>"Her voice is full of money." Gatsby suddenly continued.</t2318>
<t2319>That's right. Yet before, I couldn't understand this.</t2319> <t2320>Daisy's voice truly carried the essence of money - It was a mesmerizing, undying melody, tinkling and melodious like the music of the song "...</t2320> <t2321>In the high, towering white palace, there was a golden princess, the king's daughter..."</t2321>
<t2322>Tom stepped out of the house with a bottle of wine wrapped in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan, each wearing a small metallic fabric hat that fit snugly on their heads, and carrying two light cloaks on their arms.</t2322>
<t2323>"Everyone ride in my car?" Gatsby suggested, touching the scorching green leather seat.</t2323> <t2324>"I should have parked in the shade."</t2324>
<t2325>"Is your car's manual transmission the standard type?" Tom asked.</t2325>
<t2326>"That's right."</t2326>
<t2327>"So, you drive my two-seater car, and I'll drive your car."</t2327>
<t2328>The suggestion made Gatsby uncomfortable, and he objected.</t2328>
<t2329>"I think my car doesn't have much gas left."</t2329>
<t2330>"There's still plenty of gas." Tom said loudly and then looked at the fuel gauge.</t2330> <t2331>"If it runs out of gas, I can stop at some drugstore."</t2331> <t2332>"Nowadays, you can buy anything at drugstores."</t2332>
<t2333>Everyone fell silent after this meaningless and out-of-place comment.</t2333> <t2334>Daisy looked at Tom with a frown, and on Gatsby's face there was a fleeting, indescribable expression, an expression that I was certain I had never seen before but also vaguely familiar, as if I had only heard it described in words.</t2334>
<t2335>"Go Daisy." Tom said, using his hand to push Daisy towards Gatsby's car.</t2335> <t2336>"I will take you home in this circus wagon."</t2336>
<t2337>Tom opened the car door, but Daisy backed away from his arm.</t2337>
<t2338>"I'll drive Nick and Jordan."</t2338> <t2339>"The two of us will follow behind on this scooter."</t2339>
<t2340>Daisy walked closer to Gatsby, gently placing her hand on Gatsby's coat.</t2340> <t2341>Jordan, Tom, and I stepped into the upper bench seat of Gatsby's car.</t2341> <t2342>Tom hesitantly reached out to pull the unfamiliar gear shift, and then we sped off into the stifling heat, leaving the other two behind.</t2342>
<t2343>"Did you see that?" Tom asked.</t2343>
<t2344>"See what?"</t2344>
<t2345>Tom threw me a sharp look, suddenly realizing that both Jordan and I had certainly known everything for a long time.</t2345>
<t2346>"You all think I'm very stupid, don't you?" Tom asked.</t2346> <t2347>"Maybe I'm stupid, but I have something that sometimes acts almost like a second pair of eyes, it tells me what I should do.</t2347> <t2348>Maybe you all don't believe me, but science..."</t2348>
<t2349>Tom stopped.</t2349> <t2350>The obviousness in front of him immediately took hold of him,</t2350>
<t2351>pulling him away from the edge of the unrealistic abyss.</t2351>
<t2352>"I did a little investigation on this guy." Tom continued.</t2352> <t2353>"I could have investigated more thoroughly if I had known..."</t2353>
<t2354>"Do you mean you went to see a fortune teller?" Jordan asked humorously.</t2354>
<t2355>"What? A fortune teller? What for?" Tom asked in bewilderment, staring at the two of us while we burst into laughter.</t2355>
<t2356>"To ask about Gatsby."</t2356>
<t2357>"Ask the fortune teller about Gatsby!</t2357> <t2358>No, that's not it.</t2358> <t2359>I said that I had done a little investigation into his past."</t2359>
<t2360>"And he found out that he was from Oxford," Jordan suggested.</t2360>
<t2361>"Oxford people!" Tom said with a tone full of doubt.</t2361> <t2362>"Not even close."</t2362> <t2363>He was wearing a pink suit."</t2363>
<t2364>"After all, he is still an Oxford alumnus."</t2364>
<t2365>"There is an Oxford in the state of New Mexico." Tom snorted derisively. "Or somewhere similar."</t2365>
<t2366>"Listen here, Tom. If you're so arrogant and condescending, why did you invite him to lunch?" Jordan asked irritably.</t2366>
<t2367>"Because Daisy invited him.</t2367> <t2368>She knew him before we got married.</t2368> <t2369>God knows where they met."</t2369>
<t2370>The alcohol in our bodies had dissipated, making all of us become easily irritable.</t2370> <t2371>Aware of this, we tried to keep silent as the car drove for a long while.</t2371> <t2372>When the faded eyes of ophthalmologist T. J.</t2372> <t2373>Eckleburg appeared at the end of the road, I suddenly remembered Gatsby's reminder about the gasoline.</t2373>
<t2374>"We still have enough gas to get to town," Tom said.</t2374>
<t2375>"But there's a repair shop right here." Jordan protested.</t2375> <t2376>"I don't want the car to break down in this scorching heat." Tom impatiently slammed both brakes, the car skidded to a dusty halt right under Wilson's sign.</t2376> <t2377>After a moment, the shop owner emerged, his deep-set eyes staring intently at the car.</t2377>
<t2378>"Fill up the gas and let's go." Tom said loudly in a rude manner. "What do you think we stopped the car here for?</t2378> <t2379>To enjoy the scenery here?"</t2379>
<t2380>"I'm sick." Wilson said without moving. "I've been sick all day."</t2380>
<t2381>"What's wrong?"</t2381>
<t2382>"I have lost all my strength."</t2382>
<t2383>"So I have to do it myself?" Tom said.</t2383> <t2384>"You sounded very energetic on the phone earlier."</t2384>
<t2385>Trying his best, Wilson stepped out of the shadow and the door he was leaning on, gasping heavily as he opened the fuel tank cap.</t2385> <t2386>Under the sunlight, his face looked pale.</t2386>
<t2387>"I don't mean to disturb your lunch." Wilson said.</t2387> <t2388>"However, I am in urgent need of money and I don't know what you plan to do with your old car."</t2388>
<t2389>"Do you like this car?" Tom asked.</t2389> <t2390>"I just bought it last week."</t2390>
<t2391>"This yellow car is very beautiful," Wilson said as he pulled the fuel lever.</t2391>
<t2392>"Do you want to buy it?"</t2392>
<t2393>"It's very unlikely." Wilson smiled weakly.</t2393> <t2394>"But I could make a little profit if I manage to buy that one."</t2394>
<t2395>"Why do you suddenly need money like that?"</t2395>
<t2396>"I have been here for quite a long time.</t2396> <t2397>I want to move somewhere else.</t2397> <t2398>My wife and I want to move to the West."</t2398>
<t2399>"Your wife wants to move out?" Tom was astonished.</t2399>
<t2400>"She has been talking about this for ten years." Wilson stood leaning against the gas pump to rest for a moment, shading his eyes from the sun.</t2400> <t2401>"Now, whether she wants to or not, she has to go.</t2401> <t2402>I will drag her away."</t2402>
<t2403>The cup motorbike sped past us, kicking up a cloud of dust and a fleeting wave of a hand.</t2403>
<t2404>"How much money is this?" Tom asked hurriedly.</t2404>
<t2405>"Just two days ago, I discovered something suspicious," Wilson recounted. "That's why I want to move out."</t2405> <t2406>"That's why I bothered you about the car."</t2406>
<t2407>"How much money is this?"</t2407>
<t2408>"One dong two."</t2408>
<t2409>The oppressive heat made my mind numb, and I felt uncomfortable for a while until I suddenly realized that Wilson's suspicion was not directed at Tom. Wilson had discovered that Myrtle's life had somewhat diverged from his own, leading her into another world.</t2409> <t2410>This shock had made him sick and exhausted.</t2410> <t2411>I looked at Wilson and then turned to look at Tom. Like Wilson, Tom had only just discovered the same thing an hour ago.</t2411> <t2412>This made me think that there is no intellectual or racial difference between people, unlike the clear difference between the sick and the healthy.</t2412> <t2413>Wilson was so sick that he looked as if he were bearing an unforgivable sin, a sin like having made some poor girl pregnant.</t2413>
<t2414>"I will sell you that car," Tom said.</t2414> <t2415>"I will have someone deliver it to you tomorrow afternoon."</t2415>
<t2416>This place always seems to give people a vague feeling of anxiety and worry, even though it is in the middle of a bright sunny afternoon.</t2416> <t2417>I turned my head back, sensing as if something was happening behind me.</t2417> <t2418>On the other side of the ash heaps, the giant eyes of Dr. T. J.</t2418> <t2419>Eckleburg were watchfully guarding.</t2419> <t2420>However, after a moment, I noticed that about twenty meters away from us, another pair of eyes was staring at us unusually intently.</t2420>
<t2421>In one of the upstairs windows of the garage, the curtain was slightly drawn back, and Myrtle Wilson was peeking down at the car.</t2421> <t2422>She was so engrossed in looking that she didn't realize she was being watched.</t2422> <t2423>Various emotions flitted across her face like a photograph slowly developing.</t2423> <t2424>Myrtle's expression bore a familiar curiosity, the kind I often saw on the faces of women.</t2424> <t2425>But in Myrtle, that look seemed undefined and inexplicable, until I realized that her eyes, wide with a horrified jealousy, were not fixed on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom Myrtle mistakenly thought was Tom's wife.</t2425>
<t2426>There is no confusion that can compare to the confusion of a shallow person.</t2426> <t2427>As we drove away from that place, Tom felt as if he were being lashed by the scorching whips of panic.</t2427> <t2428>An hour ago, both his wife and his lover were securely and inviolably his.</t2428> <t2429>Now, both of them were quickly slipping out of his control.</t2429> <t2430>Instinctively, Tom pressed hard on the accelerator pedal with two purposes: to catch up with Daisy and to leave Wilson behind.</t2430> <t2431>And so our car sped at fifty-five miles per hour towards Astoria, until the web-like girders of the bridge loomed overhead and the silhouette of the blue car leisurely driving on the road appeared.</t2431>
<t2432>"The big movie theaters around Fifty Street are really cool." Jordan suggested.</t2432> <t2433>"I like New York in the summer afternoons when everyone has left.</t2433> <t2434>There is something very sensual, ripe about it, like all kinds of exotic fruits falling into your hands."</t2434>
<t2435>The word sensuality made Tom even more restless, but before he could think of something to refute it, the scooter had already stopped, and Daisy signaled for us to move closer to the side.</t2435><t2436>"Where are we going?" Daisy shouted.</t2436>
<t2437>"How about going to the movies?"</t2437>
<t2438>"It's very hot." Daisy complained. "You all go ahead.</t2438> <t2439>The two of us will run around and meet everyone later." Daisy tried to sound humorously dull.</t2439> <t2440>"We'll meet everyone at some street corner.</t2440> <t2441>I'll pretend to be the man smoking two cigarettes." "We can't argue here." Tom said impatiently as a truck behind us honked angrily.</t2441> <t2442>"You two follow me to the south side of Central Park, right in front of the Plaza Hotel."</t2442>
<t2443>Every now and then, Tom would turn his head to look at their car following behind, and if the traffic caused their car to fall behind, he would slow down until their car came back into view.</t2443> <t2444>I think Tom was afraid they would take another road and disappear from his life forever.</t2444>
<t2445>However, they did not do so, and then we all made a decision that required less explanation: renting a large room with many compartments in the Plaza Hotel.</t2445>
<t2446>I no longer remember anything about the long and noisy debate that finally ended with us being herded into that room.</t2446> <t2447>However, I still vividly remember that in that situation, my underwear felt like a wet snake crawling around my legs and the cool sweat beads rolling down my back.</t2447> <t2448>First, Daisy suggested renting a room with five bathrooms so we could cool off with a bath.</t2448> <t2449>Then the suggestion was changed to a more practical one: "a place to drink mint juleps."</t2449> <t2450>Each of us repeatedly said that it was a crazy idea.</t2450> <t2451>We all simultaneously told the confused hotel staff and then assumed, or pretended to think, that we were all being humorous.</t2451>
<t2452>The room was very spacious but suffocatingly stuffy.</t2452> <t2453>Although it was already four in the afternoon, even with the windows wide open, only a hot breeze from the scorching park trees could be felt.</t2453> <t2454>Daisy stepped towards the mirror to fix her hair, her back turned towards us,</t2454>
<t2455>"This room is really luxurious." Jordan whispered respectfully and then we all burst out laughing.</t2455>
<t2456>"Open another window." Daisy said, not turning around.</t2456>
<t2457>"There isn't any left to open"</t2457>
<t2458>"In that case, I have to call to have them bring up the axe."</t2458>
<t2459>"It's better to forget about the heat." Tom said impatiently.</t2459> <t2460>"You make it ten times worse by complaining like that."</t2460>
<t2461>Tom unwrapped the bottle of wine and placed it on the table.</t2461>
<t2462>"Why don't you leave her alone, old sport?" Gatsby criticized.</t2462> <t2463>"You're the one who wanted to go to town."</t2463>
<t2464>A moment passed in silence.</t2464> <t2465>The phone directory book slipped off the nail and fell heavily to the floor.</t2465> <t2466>Jordan whispered.</t2466> <t2467>"Sorry." But this time, no one laughed.</t2467>
<t2468>"Let me pick it up for you." I said.</t2468>
<t2469>"I picked it up already." Gatsby said, examining the broken string with a focused look, muttering "Hmm" and then throwing the book onto a chair.</t2469>
<t2470>"Isn't that the way you like to talk the most?" Tom said abruptly.</t2470>
<t2471>"What?"</t2471>
<t2472>"Those words 'old buddy'.</t2472> <t2473>Where did you pick them up from here?"</t2473>
<t2474>"Come on, Tom." Daisy said, turning away from the mirror.</t2474> <t2475>"If</t2475>
<t2476>If you continue to make such personal jabs, I won't stay here for another minute.</t2476> <t2477>Call someone to bring up some ice for the drinks."</t2477>
<t2478>When Tom picked up the phone, the pent-up heat exploded into sound.</t2478> <t2479>We could hear the prelude of Mendelssohn's wedding march drifting from the ballroom downstairs.</t2479>
<t2480>"Just imagine having to get married in this kind of heat." Jordan said loudly in a dejected manner.</t2480>
<t2481>"It's okay.</t2481> <t2482>I got married in the middle of June." Daisy recalled. "Oh dear, Louisville in June. Someone fainted.</t2482> <t2483>Who fainted, Tom?"</t2483>
<t2484>"Biloxi." Tom answered briefly.</t2484>
<t2485>"A guy named Biloxi.</t2485> <t2486>The guy 'blocks' Biloxi and he makes barrels.</t2486> <t2487>It's true, he comes from Biloxi, Tennessee."</t2487>
<t2488>"They carried him to your house." Jordan continued.</t2488> <t2489>"Because your house is only two doors away from the church."</t2489> <t2490>He stayed at your house for three weeks, until your father had to kick him out.</t2490> <t2491>One day after he left, your father passed away." After a moment, Jordan added.</t2491> <t2492>"The two events are unrelated."</t2492>
<t2493>Previously, I knew a person named Bill Biloxi in Memphis," I remarked.</t2493>
<t2494>"That guy is a cousin.</t2494> <t2495>I know the history of his entire family before he left.</t2495> <t2496>He gave me an aluminum golf club that I still use to this day."</t2496>
<t2497>The music had quieted down as the wedding ceremony began, the cheers of congratulations floated in through the windows, followed by intermittent shouts of "Yea-ea-ea", and finally burst into jazz music as the dance began.</t2497>
<t2498>"We have become old.</t2498> <t2499>If we were still young, we would have stood up and danced right away," Daisy said.</t2499>
<t2500>"Remember the example of that Biloxi guy." Jordan advised Daisy.</t2500> <t2501>"Where did you meet him, Tom?"</t2501>
<t2502>"Biloxi?" Tom tried to recall.</t2502> <t2503>"I don't know him."</t2503> <t2504>"He is a friend of Daisy's."</t2504>
<t2505>"He is not my friend," Daisy retorted.</t2505> <t2506>"I have never met him before.</t2506> <t2507>He came in his own car."</t2507>
<t2508>"Really, he said he knows you.</t2508> <t2509>He said he grew up in Louisville.</t2509> <t2510>Asa Bird showed him around and at the last minute asked if we had a place for him to stay."</t2510>
<t2511>Jordan smiled.</t2511>
<t2512>"Perhaps he is trying to find his way back home."</t2512> <t2513>"He told me that he was your class president at Yale."</t2513>
<t2514>"Biloxi?"</t2514>
<t2515>"Biloxi?" Both Tom and I looked at each other in confusion.</t2515>
<t2516>"First of all, we don't have a class monitor at all.."</t2516>
<t2517>Gatsby nervously tapped his foot repeatedly in short rhythms, and Tom suddenly turned his eyes towards him.</t2517>
<t2518>"By the way, may I ask, Mr. Gatsby, I heard that you are a former Oxford student."</t2518>
<t2519>"It's not exactly like that."</t2519>
<t2520>"It's true, I heard that you studied at Oxford."</t2520>
<t2521>"Yes, I studied there."</t2521>
<t2522>The atmosphere fell into silence.</t2522> <t2523>Then Tom's voice rose, full of suspicion and insult.</t2523> <t2524>"You must have been there at the same time Biloxi was attending school in New Haven."</t2524>
<t2525>Following those words was silence again.</t2525> <t2526>The waiter knocked on the door and brought in mint and ice, but his thank you and the soft closing of the door couldn't break the silence in the room.</t2526> <t2527>This terrible detail had finally come to light.</t2527>
<t2528>"I told you I had studied there." Gatsby said.</t2528>
<t2529>"I have heard you speak, but I want to know during what time period."</t2529>
<t2530>"I went to school there in nineteen nineteen.</t2530> <t2531>I only studied there for five months.</t2531> <t2532>That's why I can't really call myself an Oxford alumnus."</t2532>
<t2533>Tom glanced around to see if we were as astonished as he was.</t2533> <t2534>But at that moment, all of us were looking at Gatsby.</t2534>
<t2535>"That was the opportunity that the government granted to officers after the Armistice." Gatsby continued.</t2535> <t2536>"We could attend any university in England or France."</t2536>
<t2537>At that moment, I wanted to stand up and pat Gatsby on the back.</t2537> <t2538>I had completely regained my faith in him as I had once experienced before.</t2538>
<t2539>Daisy stood up, smiled gently, and walked to the table.</t2539>
<t2540>"Open the whiskey, Tom," Daisy ordered.</t2540> <t2541>"I'll make you a mint julep.</t2541> <t2542>Then you won't be foolish anymore...</t2542> <t2543>Look at this pile of mint."</t2543>
<t2544>"Wait a minute." Tom snapped. "I want to ask Gatsby one more question."</t2544>
<t2545>"Feel free." Gatsby replied politely.</t2545>
<t2546>"What are you planning to stir up in my family."</t2546>
<t2547>In the end, what needed to be said was said, and it made Gatsby happy.</t2547>
<t2548>"He didn't cause any trouble." Daisy looked pleadingly from one person to another. "You're the one causing the scene.</t2548> <t2549>Please keep your composure, can't you?"</t2549>
<t2550>"Self-control!" Tom repeated skeptically.</t2550> <t2551>"Do you mean to say that I should just sit and wait for some insignificant man from who knows where to come and sleep with my wife?</t2551> <t2552>Well, if that's the idea you want me to follow.</t2552> <t2553>Now people are starting to mock family life and the institution of family, and later they will throw everything away and accept white and black people marrying each other."</t2553>
<t2554>With these incoherent and agitated stammering words, Tom had pushed himself to the very edge of civilization.</t2554>
<t2555>"We are all white people." Jordan whispered.</t2555>
<t2556>"I know I'm not liked by many, I don't throw big parties.</t2556> <t2557>Do I have to turn my house into a pigsty just to hope for friends - in this modern world..."</t2557>
<t2558>Just like me, everyone in the room felt angry.</t2558> <t2559>However, I wanted to burst out laughing every time Tom opened his mouth.</t2559> <t2560>He had completely transformed from a playboy into a self-righteous preacher.</t2560>
<t2561>"I have something I need to say to YOU, old sport.." Gatsby began, but Daisy had already guessed Gatsby's intention.</t2561>
<t2562>"Please don't!".</t2562> <t2563>Daisy interrupted urgently.</t2563> <t2564>"Let's go home.</t2564> <t2565>Why don't we leave?"</t2565>
<t2566>"That's a good idea." I stood up. "Let's go, Tom. No one wants to drink anymore."</t2566>
<t2567>"I want to hear what Mr. Gatsby has to say to me."</t2567>
<t2568>"Your wife doesn't love you," Gatsby said.</t2568> <t2569>"She never loved you.</t2569> <t2570>She loves me."</t2570>
<t2571>"You are truly crazy!" Tom shouted like a machine.</t2571>
<t2572>Gatsby stood up abruptly, intensely emotional.</t2572>
<t2573>"She never loved you, do you hear?" Gatsby said loudly.</t2573> <t2574>"She married you only because I was poor and because she was tired of waiting for me.</t2574> <t2575>It was a colossal mistake, but in her heart, she has never loved anyone except me."</t2575>
<t2576>By this time, both Jordan and I wanted to leave that place, but Tom and Gatsby were equally determined to keep us there, as if they had nothing to hide and considered it a privilege to share their emotions with us.</t2576>
<t2577>"Sit down, Daisy." Tom commanded with a superior tone, but it was unsuccessful.</t2577> <t2578>"What happened?</t2578> <t2579>I want to hear everything."</t2579>
<t2580>"I told you what happened." Gatsby said.</t2580> <t2581>"It happened five years ago and you knew nothing about it."</t2581>
<t2582>Tom turned abruptly towards Daisy.</t2582>
<t2583>"You've been seeing this guy for five years already</t2583><t2584>?"</t2584>
<t2585>"It wasn't about meeting each other." Gatsby explained.</t2585> <t2586>"No, we never met.</t2586> <t2587>But in our hearts, we always loved each other.</t2587> <t2588>Old sport.</t2588> <t2589>You didn't know this.</t2589> <t2590>I often laughed thinking that you didn't know anything." But there was nothing resembling a laugh in Gatsby's eyes.</t2590>
<t2591>"Oh, that's all." Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a monk and leaned back in his chair.</t2591>
<t2592>"You are truly insane!" Tom fumed.</t2592> <t2593>"I don't touch on things that happened five years ago because I didn't know Daisy back then.</t2593> <t2594>And I also want to know how you got close to my wife within a mile unless you were the food delivery guy coming in through the back door.</t2594> <t2595>But everything else is a lie.</t2595> <t2596>Daisy loved me when she married me and she still loves me now."</t2596>
<t2597>"Not true." Gatsby shook his head and said.</t2597>
<t2598>"She does.</t2598> <t2599>It's just that sometimes she gets foolish thoughts in her head and doesn't know what she's doing." Tom nodded solemnly.</t2599> <t2600>"Besides, I also love Daisy.</t2600> <t2601>Sometimes I foolishly go out with friends to have fun, but I always come back.</t2601> <t2602>In my heart, I always love her."</t2602>
<t2603>"He's repenting." Daisy said.</t2603> <t2604>She turned to me, her voice dropping, filling the room with feelings of contempt. "Do you know why we left Chicago?"</t2604> <t2605>I'm surprised they haven't told you the story of their escapades."</t2605>
<t2606>Gatsby stepped forward to stand next to Daisy and spoke passionately.</t2606>
<t2607>"Daisy, everything is over, it's no longer an issue.</t2607> <t2608>Tell him the truth, the truth that you never loved him and that everything has been erased."</t2608>
<t2609>Daisy looked at Gatsby in a daze. "How - How could you love him?"</t2609>
<t2610>"I have never loved him."</t2610>
<t2611>Daisy hesitated.</t2611> <t2612>Her eyes looked at Jordan and me imploringly, as if she had finally realized what she was doing, as if she had never intended to do anything until now.</t2612> <t2613>But now the story had unfolded, it was too late.</t2613>
<t2614>"I have never loved him." Daisy said with evident reluctance.</t2614>
<t2615>"Even at Kapiolani?" Tom asked abruptly.</t2615>
<t2616>"No."</t2616>
<t2617>From the ballroom downstairs, the chords, sounding like they were suffocating, floated up with the hot air.</t2617>
<t2618>"Including the day you carried me off the Punch Bowl to keep my shoes dry? Right, Daisy?" Tom's voice carried a gentle, melancholic tone.</t2618>
<t2619>"Please don't!".</t2619> <t2620>Daisy's voice, though cold, had lost its tone of hostility.</t2620> <t2621>Daisy looked up at Gatsby. "Jay".</t2621> <t2622>Daisy said, her trembling hand reaching up to light a cigarette.</t2622> <t2623>Suddenly, Daisy threw the burning cigarette onto the carpet.</t2623>
<t2624>"You ask for too much!" Daisy said loudly to Gatsby. "I love you now, isn't that enough."</t2624> <t2625>"I can't do anything about the past." Daisy sobbed. "I once loved him - but I also loved you."</t2625>
<t2626>Gatsby's eyes opened and then closed.</t2626> <t2627>He repeated.</t2627>
<t2628>"You love me too, don't you?"</t2628>
<t2629>"Even if it was just a lie." Tom said cruelly.</t2629> <t2630>"She doesn't know that you're still alive.</t2630> <t2631>Why?</t2631> <t2632>There are things that happened between Daisy and me that you k</t2632>
<t2633>We will never know.</t2633> <t2634>There are things that neither of us will ever forget."</t2634>
<t2635>These words seemed to have torn Gatsby's body apart.</t2635>
<t2636>"I want to speak privately with Daisy.</t2636> <t2637>She is emotional right now." Gatsby insisted.</t2637>
<t2638>"Even if it's just the two of us, I can't say that I never loved Tom. That wouldn't be true," Daisy confessed miserably.</t2638>
<t2639>"Of course, that's not right." Tom agreed.</t2639>
<t2640>Daisy turned her head to look at her husband.</t2640>
<t2641>"You act as if that matters to you."</t2641>
<t2642>"Of course it's important.</t2642> <t2643>From now on, I promise to take better care of you."</t2643>
<t2644>"Actually, you don't understand.</t2644> <t2645>You won't be able to take care of Daisy anymore." Gatsby said, his voice showing signs of panic.</t2645>
<t2646>"I can't?" Tom's eyes widened and then he burst out laughing.</t2646> <t2647>Now he had regained his composure. "Why is that?"</t2647>
<t2648>"Because Daisy will leave you."</t2648>
<t2649>"Nonsense."</t2649>
<t2650>"That's right." Daisy said with a noticeable effort.</t2650>
<t2651>"She will not leave me!" Tom's words suddenly turned towards Gatsby.</t2651> <t2652>"Surely she will not leave me to follow a fraud, who would have to steal even a wedding ring to put on her finger."</t2652>
<t2653>"I can't take it anymore.</t2653> <t2654>Please, let's get out of here." Daisy said loudly.</t2654>
<t2655>"Who do you think you are?" Tom burst out laughing. "You're just one of those guys who hang around Meyer Wolfsheim, I already know everything.</t2655> <t2656>I've had people investigate your activities and tomorrow I'll continue to investigate further."</t2656>
<t2657>"Feel free to make yourself at home, old sport." Gatsby calmly said.</t2657>
<t2658>"I have discovered what his pharmacies are really doing." Tom turned back to us and said hurriedly.</t2658>
<t2659>"He and this guy Wolfsheim bought up a lot of drugstores here and in Chicago to sell bootleg liquor.</t2659> <t2660>That was just one of his small-time operations.</t2660> <t2661>I guessed right away that he was a bootlegger the first time I met him.</t2661> <t2662>And I wasn't too wrong, was I?"</t2662>
<t2663>"So what?" Gatsby said politely. "I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to get involved in this work."</t2663>
<t2664>"And you abandoned him in his time of need, didn't you?</t2664> <t2665>You let him go to jail for a month in New Jersey.</t2665> <t2666>Oh my! You should hear Walter tell stories about you."</t2666>
<t2667>"When he came to find us, he didn't have a penny left.</t2667> <t2668>He had earned a little money and was already very happy, old friend."</t2668>
<t2669>"Don't call me 'old buddy'!" Tom shouted.</t2669> <t2670>Gatsby did not reply.</t2670> <t2671>"Walter can put you guys in jail for illegal betting. But Wolfsheim threatened him to keep his mouth shut."</t2671>
<t2672>The unusual but easily recognizable expression of Gatsby appeared on his face again.</t2672>
<t2673>"The business at the drugstores is just a trivial matter.</t2673> <t2674>You guys are involved in something else that Walter is still too afraid to reveal to me."</t2674>
<t2675>I glanced at Daisy, who was fearfully standing and looking between Gatsby and her husband.</t2675> <t2676>Then I looked over at Jordan, who was balancing some invisible object on her chin.</t2676> <t2677>When I turned back to look at Gatsby, I was surprised by his expression.</t2677> <t2678>He looked like he had "just killed someone" - to use the absurd slanders I had heard with disdain in his garden.</t2678>
<t2679>When that expression had faded away, Gatsby began to explain to Daisy in an agitated manner.</t2679> <t2680>He dismissed everything and defended his reputation against the slanders that had just been mentioned.</t2680> <t2681>However, the more he spoke, the more Daisy recoiled, so in the end, Gatsby had to give up. Only his dying dream continued to struggle, trying to hold onto the fading afternoon, desperately reaching for what was no longer real to him, struggling painfully, not despairing towards the voice that was fading away on the other side of the room.</t2681>
<t2682>That voice pleaded to return once more.</t2682>
<t2683>"PLEASE, Tom! I can't take it anymore."</t2683>
<t2684>Daisy's eyes, full of fear, showed that all her intentions or all the courage she once had were now gone.</t2684>
<t2685>"Daisy, you two go home, go by Gatsby's car." Tom said.</t2685>
<t2686>Daisy looked at Tom worriedly, yet he still insisted on speaking with a tone of lofty contempt.</t2686>
<t2687>"Go ahead.</t2687> <t2688>He won't bother you anymore.</t2688> <t2689>I think he has realized that his petty flirtations have come to an end."</t2689>
<t2690>The two of them walked away without saying a word, disappearing quickly, independent, separate, like ghosts right before our pity.</t2690>
<t2691>A moment later, Tom stood up and began wrapping the unopened bottles of wine back into the cloth.</t2691>
<t2692>"Do you want this?</t2692> <t2693>Jordan?</t2693> <t2694>Nick?"</t2694>
<t2695>I did not answer.</t2695>
<t2696>"Nick?" he asked once again.</t2696>
<t2697>"What's going on?"</t2697>
<t2698>"Want a little?"</t2698>
<t2699>"No..."</t2699> <t2700>"I just remembered that today is my birthday."</t2700>
<t2701>I am thirty years old.</t2701> <t2702>In front of me is a long road full of the threatening challenges of a new decade.</t2702>
<t2703>When we got into his two-seater car to head to Long Island, it was already seven in the evening.</t2703> <t2704>Tom talked cheerfully and laughed continuously.</t2704> <t2705>However, from where Jordan and I were sitting, his voice seemed distant, like the strange shouting on the sidewalk or the bustling noise heard from above.</t2705> <t2706>Human compassion has its limits; we were happy to let their sorrowful arguments fade away along with the streetlights left behind.</t2706> <t2707>Thirty years old, a promise of a decade full of loneliness, of a dwindling list of single young friends, of a briefcase holding thinning enthusiasm, and of thinning hair.</t2707> <t2708>But I still had Jordan beside me; unlike Daisy, this girl was wiser and would never carry with her the forgotten dreams from time to time.</t2708> <t2709>As our car crossed the dark bridge, Jordan's weary, tired face lazily rested on my coat shoulder.</t2709> <t2710>And then the dreadful bell toll marking my thirtieth year was silenced when Jordan's hand gripped mine as a promise.</t2710>
<t2711>And so, we drove towards the direction of death, through the gradually cooling twilight darkness.</t2711>
<t2712>The young Greek man, Michaelis, who owned a café right next to the ash heaps, was the primary witness of the investigation.</t2712> <t2713>He had slept through the heat until five in the afternoon.</t2713> <t2714>When he walked to the garage, he found Wilson, who was ill, sitting in the office.</t2714> <t2715>Wilson was very ill, his face as pale as his pale hair, his whole body trembling.</t2715> <t2716>Michaelis advised Wilson to go to bed and rest, but Wilson refused, saying that doing so would cause him to lose many customers.</t2716> <t2717>While the neighbor was trying to persuade Wilson, loud crashing noises came from upstairs.</t2717>
<t2718>"I locked my wife up there." Wilson calmly explained.</t2718> <t2719>"I plan to keep her up there until the day after tomorrow, then we will move far away from here."</t2719>
<t2720>Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years, and it seemed Wilson had never had the ability to make such a statement.</t2720> <t2721>Generally, he was the type of weak-willed man who, if he wasn't working, would sit on the chair at the doorway staring blankly at the people and cars passing by on the street.</t2721> <t2722>Whenever someone came to chat, he would give them a fixed, insipid, ingratiating smile.</t2722> <t2723>Wilson was the type of man who was weak and afraid of his wife.</t2723>
<t2724>Of course, Michaelis tried to understand what had happened.</t2724> <t2725>However, Wilson did not reveal a word; instead, he started casting suspicious and curious glances towards his neighbor and asked what Michaelis had been doing and at what time on which day.</t2725> <t2726>When Michaelis began to feel uncomfortable, a few workers passed by the door heading towards his restaurant.</t2726> <t2727>Michaelis took this opportunity to leave, but with the intention of returning.</t2727> <t2728>However, Michaelis did not return.</t2728> <t2729>Perhaps he simply forgot, that's all.</t2729> <t2730>When he stepped outside the door again, it was just past seven o'clock, and he heard Wilson's wife shouting and yelling downstairs at the garage, which reminded him of the earlier conversation with Wilson.</t2730>
<t2731>"Hit me!" Michaelis heard Myrtle crying.</t2731> <t2732>"Just pin me down and hit me, you despicable coward."</t2732>
<t2733>A moment later, Wilson's wife ran quickly outside into the darkness, waving her hands and calling out.</t2733> <t2734>Before Michaelis had a chance to step out the door, it was all over.</t2734>
<t2735>"The Death Car," as the newspapers dubbed it, did not stop; it shot out from the blending darkness, swerving tragically back and forth, then disappeared as it sped past the curve in the road.</t2735> <t2736>Michaeils was not very sure about the color of the car; he reported to the first arriving police officer that the car was green.</t2736> <t2737>Another car, heading towards New York, stopped after about a hundred yards, and the driver hurried to Myrtle's body, where life had been tragically snuffed out, lying crumpled on the road, in a pool of thick, dark blood mixed with the dust of the road.</t2737>
<t2738>Michaelis and this man were the first two to reach Myrtle's body, but when they tore open her sweat-drenched shirt, they saw that her left chest had been torn open like a wing, making it unnecessary to listen for breath beneath her ribcage.</t2738> <t2739>Her mouth was wide open, torn at the corners, as if she had choked while expelling the fierce vitality she had stored within herself for so long.</t2739>
<t2740>We saw about three or four cars parked and a crowd when we were still some distance away.</t2740>
<t2741>"Car crash." Tom said.</t2741> <t2742>"That's good."</t2742> <t2743>"Finally, Wilson will have something to do."</t2743>
<t2744>Tom slowed the car down but had no intention of stopping until we got closer; the tense, silent faces of the people standing at the garage door immediately made him hit the brakes.</t2744>
<t2745>"Let's go in and take a look," Tom said doubtfully. "Just to look."</t2745>
<t2746>I began to notice the continuous, hoarse sound of crying coming from the repair shop as we stepped out of the car</t2746>
<t2747>as I moved towards the door, this sound transformed into gasping moans of "Oh my God" repeated over and over.</t2747>
<t2748>"Something bad is happening here." Tom said excitedly.</t2748>
<t2749>He stood on tiptoe to look over the heads of the crowd into the repair shop, which was only dimly lit by a yellow light placed inside a zinc basket hanging loosely overhead.</t2749> <t2750>Tom let out a gruff sound from his throat and forcefully used his muscular arms to push the crowd aside to step forward.</t2750>
<t2751>The circle of the crowd immediately closed up again with murmurs of criticism and comments, and it took me about a minute to see everything clearly.</t2751> <t2752>Then the newcomers disturbed the crowd again, and Jordan and I were suddenly pushed inside.</t2752>
<t2753>The body of Myrtle Wilson was wrapped inside a blanket, with an additional blanket outside, as if she were experiencing a chill on a hot evening.</t2753> <t2754>The body was placed on the work table by the wall.</t2754> <t2755>Tom was then turning his back to us, leaning forward, motionless.</t2755> <t2756>Beside him was a motorcycle policeman, laboriously writing a name into a small notebook, sweating profusely and crossing out repeatedly.</t2756> <t2757>At first, I couldn't identify whose high-pitched groans were echoing loudly in the empty garage, but then I realized Wilson was standing on the step of his office, swaying back and forth, gripping the doorpost with both hands.</t2757> <t2758>A man was speaking softly to Wilson and occasionally placing a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson seemed neither to hear nor see anything.</t2758> <t2759>His eyes slowly roved from the swaying lamp to the heavy table by the wall and then back to the lamp, continuously uttering shrill, mournful cries:</t2759>
<t2760>"Oh my God, oh my.... God! oh my.... God! oh my.... God!"</t2760>
<t2761>At that moment, Tom abruptly lifted his head, staring around the garage with vacant eyes, then mumbled something to the police officer that was inaudible.</t2761>
<t2762>"M-a-y." The policeman said, "-o</t2762><t2763>-"</t2763>
<t2764>"No, r-" the police officer corrected himself, "M-a-v-r-o-"</t2764>
<t2765>"Listen to me!" Tom growled fiercely.</t2765>
<t2766>"r" the policeman said, "o-"</t2766>
<t2767>"g-"</t2767>
<t2768>"W-" He looked up when Tom's large hand clapped heavily on his shoulder. "What do you need, buddy?"</t2768>
<t2769>"What happened?"</t2769> <t2770>"That's what I want to know."</t2770>
<t2771>"The car hit her.</t2771> <t2772>She died instantly."</t2772>
<t2773>"Instant death." Tom repeated, staring intently.</t2773>
<t2774>"She ran out onto the street, The bastard didn't stop the car at all."</t2774>
<t2775>"There were two cars in all." Michaelis said. "One coming, one going, understand?"</t2775>
<t2776>"Where are you running to?" the police officer asked enthusiastically.</t2776>
<t2777>"Each one went in a different direction."</t2777> <t2778>“She...” Michaelis raised his hand to point towards the blanket, but his arm fell to his side halfway through the motion.</t2778> <t2779>"She ran outside."</t2779> <t2780>"The car coming from New York hit her, it was going about thirty or forty miles an hour at the time."</t2780>
<t2781>"What is this place called?" the police officer asked.</t2781>
<t2782>"No name at all."</t2782>
<t2783>A well-dressed black man, looking pale, approached.</t2783> <t2784>He spoke.</t2784>
<t2785>"The yellow car.</t2785> <t2786>The big yellow car.</t2786> <t2787>Still new.</t2787> <t2788>"</t2788>
<t2789>"Did you witness the accident?" the police officer asked.</t2789>
<t2790>"No, but the car passed by me at the end of the road, going faster than forty miles.</t2790> <t2791>Around fifty, sixty."</t2791>
<t2792>"Come over here so I can write down your name."</t2792> <t2793>"Move aside."</t2793> <t2794>"I want to write down his name."</t2794>
<t2795>Surely some of these conversations must have reached Wilson's ears as he was swaying behind the office door, because right after that his crying took on a new tone.</t2795>
<t2796>"No need to tell me what kind of car that is.</t2796> <t2797>Because I know what kind of car it is."</t2797>
<t2798>Observing Tom, I noticed the muscles on his back tensing up under his coat.</t2798> <t2799>He quickly walked towards Wilson, stood right in front of him, and wrapped his arms tightly around him.</t2799>
<t2800>"You need to calm down." Tom said in a rough soothing voice.</t2800>
<t2801>Wilson's eyes recognized Tom, he stood up on his tiptoes but then collapsed to his knees if Tom hadn't supported him to stand upright.</t2801>
<t2802>"Listen here," Tom said, shaking Wilson a little.</t2802> <t2803>"I just got here from New York about a minute ago.</t2803> <t2804>I brought you the coupe we discussed.</t2804> <t2805>The yellow car I was driving this afternoon isn't mine.</t2805> <t2806>Did you hear what I said?</t2806> <t2807>I haven't seen it all afternoon."</t2807>
<t2808>Only the black guy and I stood close enough to hear what Tom was saying, but the policeman seemed to have guessed something from the tone of voice and watched with aggressive eyes.</t2808>
<t2809>"What's going on?" he asked.</t2809>
<t2810>"I am his friend." Tom turned his head to answer but his hands still tightly gripped Wilson.</t2810> <t2811>"He said he knew the car that caused the accident.</t2811> <t2812>It was a yellow car."</t2812>
<t2813>A slight urge arose in his heart, and the police officer looked at Tom suspiciously.</t2813>
<t2814>"And what color is your car?"</t2814>
<t2815>"Blue color, type of cub bike."</t2815>
<t2816>"We traveled from New York." I said.</t2816>
<t2817>Someone who had been driving behind our car confirmed this, and so the police officer turned away.</t2817>
<t2818>"Now, if you let me write down the name correctly..." Wilson was lifted like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, sat him down on a chair, then turned around and left.</t2818>
<t2819>"If someone comes here to sit with him." Tom said as if giving an order.</t2819> <t2820>Tom glanced as the two men standing closest exchanged looks and then reluctantly stepped into the room.</t2820> <t2821>Tom closed the door behind them and then stepped down a level, his eyes directed towards the table.</t2821> <t2822>As he got closer to me, he whispered, "Let's go."</t2822>
<t2823>Embarrassed and awkward, with Tom's authoritative arms clearing the way, we squeezed through the still-crowded throng, passing by a doctor hurrying along, carrying his tools, having been called about half an hour earlier with vain hopes.</t2823>
<t2824>Tom drove slowly until we passed the roundabout, then he pressed the accelerator hard, and the car sped into the darkness.</t2824> <t2825>After a while, I heard a low, muffled sobbing sound and saw tears streaming down Tom's face.</t2825>
<t2826>"You despicable coward!" Tom sobbed.</t2826> <t2827>"He didn't even stop the car."</t2827>
<t2828>The Buchanan family's house suddenly drifted towards us through the rustling shadows of the dark trees.</t2828> <t2829>Tom stopped the car beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows were brightly lit amidst the vines.</t2829>
<t2830>"Daisy has gone home." Tom said.</t2830> <t2831>When we got out of the car, he glanced at me and slightly frowned.</t2831>
<t2832>"I should have taken you home to West Egg, Nick.</t2832> <t2833>There’s nothing more that can be done tonight."</t2833>
<t2834>A change had occurred in Tom; he spoke solemnly and decisively.</t2834> <t2835>As we walked across the gravel path bathed in moonlight towards the porch, Tom arranged the matter with a few brief sentences.</t2835>
<t2836>"I will call a taxi to take you home. In the meantime, you and Jordan should go into the kitchen so the staff can prepare something for you to eat, if you want anything. Please come in." Tom opened the door.</t2836>
<t2837>"No, I won't come in, thank you.</t2837> <t2838>But please call a taxi for me.</t2838> <t2839>I'll wait out here."</t2839>
<t2840>Jordan wrapped his arm around mine.</t2840>
<t2841>"Aren't you coming in, Nick?"</t2841>
<t2842>"No, thank you."</t2842>
<t2843>I felt like I was sick and wanted to be alone, but Jordan stayed with me for a while.</t2843>
<t2844>"It's only nine-thirty in the evening," Jordan said.</t2844>
<t2845>I would be crazy to step into the house.</t2845> <t2846>I had endured them all day long and suddenly I felt the same way about Jordan.</t2846> <t2847>Jordan probably noticed my expression, so she turned abruptly and hurried up the porch into the house.</t2847> <t2848>I sat down for a few minutes, burying my head in my hands until I heard the phone ringing inside the house and the butler calling for a taxi.</t2848> <t2849>Then I slowly walked down the road, away from the house, intending to wait for the taxi at the gate.</t2849>
<t2850>I had not walked twenty meters when I heard someone calling my name.</t2850> <t2851>Gatsby stepped out from between two nearby bushes.</t2851> <t2852>I might have been feeling very strange because I couldn't think of anything else except the dazzling light of the pink suit Gatsby was wearing shining under the moonlight.</t2852>
<t2853>"What are you doing here?" I asked.</t2853>
<t2854>"Just stand here, old friend."</t2854>
<t2855>It seems that the act is of a despicable and vile profession.</t2855> <t2856>I could only think that he was preparing to rob the house.</t2856> <t2857>I might not be surprised if I saw the vicious faces, the faces of Wolfsheim's henchmen, standing behind Gatsby, hidden in the dark bushes.</t2857>
<t2858>"Did you see what happened on the road?" Gatsby asked after a minute.</t2858>
<t2859>"Yes."</t2859>
<t2860>Gatsby hesitated</t2860>
<t2861>"Is the woman dead?"</t2861>
<t2862>"That's right."</t2862>
<t2863>"I think so too.</t2863> <t2864>I told Daisy I thought so too.</t2864> <t2865>It's also good that the shocks all come at once.</t2865> <t2866>She endures quite well."</t2866>
<t2867>Gatsby said it was as if only Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.</t2867>
<t2868>"I returned to West Egg by a different route." Gatsby continued. "Then I put the car in the garage.</t2868> <t2869>I don't think anyone saw us, but I'm not entirely sure."</t2869>
<t2870>At this moment, I truly hated Gatsby and didn't feel sorry for him or that he had misspoken.</t2870>
<t2871>"Who is that woman?" Gatsby asked.</t2871>
<t2872>"Her last name is Wilson.</t2872> <t2873>Her husband is a garage owner.</t2873> <t2874>How did this atrocious incident happen?"</t2874>
<t2875>"Actually, I tried to swerve the steering wheel." Gatsby left the sentence unfinished, and suddenly I guessed the truth.</t2875>
<t2876>"Was Daisy the one driving at that time?"</t2876>
<t2877>"Right." It took Gatsby a while to respond.</t2877> <t2878>"But of course, I will say that I was the one driving.</t2878> <t2879>You know, when we left New York, she was very emotional and wanted to drive to calm down.</t2879> <t2880>As our car had just passed a car going in the opposite direction, that woman suddenly ran out and collided with our car.</t2880> <t2881>It all happened in a minute; it seemed like she wanted to talk to us, she thought we were someone she knew.</t2881> <t2882>At first, Daisy swerved to avoid the woman towards the other car, but then Daisy became scared and turned the wheel back.</t2882> <t2883>The moment I grabbed the wheel, I felt</t2883>
<t2884>There was a strong collision.</t2884> <t2885>The woman must have been killed on the spot."</t2885>
<t2886>"It tore her body apart..."</t2886>
<t2887>"Don't tell me, old sport." Gatsby shrank back in fear.</t2887> <t2888>"Anyway, Daisy hit the brakes.</t2888> <t2889>I tried to help Daisy stop the car, but she couldn't do it, so I pulled the emergency brake.</t2889> <t2890>Daisy collapsed onto my lap, and I had to take over and continue driving.</t2890>
<t2891>"By tomorrow Daisy will be fine." Gatsby continued.</t2891> <t2892>"I will stand here to see if Tom bothers Daisy about this afternoon.</t2892> <t2893>Daisy locked herself in the room.</t2893> <t2894>If he behaves violently, Daisy will turn the light on and off as a signal to me."</t2894>
<t2895>"Tom doesn't touch Daisy.</t2895> <t2896>He isn't thinking about Daisy at the moment."</t2896>
<t2897>"I don't trust him, old friend."</t2897>
<t2898>"How long do you plan to wait here?"</t2898>
<t2899>"All night, if necessary."</t2899> <t2900>"At least until they all go to sleep."</t2900>
<t2901>I suddenly had a new perspective.</t2901> <t2902>Suppose if Tom found out that Daisy was the one driving the car, he might think he saw a connection - he might come up with all sorts of things.</t2902> <t2903>I looked at the house, two or three windows on the lower floor were lit, and Daisy's room on the second floor was also glowing with a pink light.</t2903>
<t2904>"You wait here.</t2904> <t2905>I'll go in and check for any signs of trouble." I said.</t2905>
<t2906>I stepped back to the edge of the grass, gently walked back along the small path, then cautiously stepped up the steps of the porch.</t2906> <t2907>The living room curtains were still open, and I saw that the room was empty.</t2907> <t2908>Crossing the porch where we had once sat and eaten on an evening in June three months ago, I approached a square window illuminated by light, which I guessed was the kitchen window.</t2908> <t2909>The curtain had been lowered, but I found a gap at the side of the door.</t2909>
<t2910>Daisy and Tom are sitting opposite each other at the table in the kitchen, with a plate of cold fried chicken and two bottles of wine in front of them.</t2910> <t2911>Across the table, Tom is engrossed in conversation with Daisy, his hand earnestly holding Daisy's hand.</t2911> <t2912>Occasionally, Daisy looks up at Tom and nods in agreement.</t2912>
<t2913>The two of them did not look happy; neither touched the chicken or the bottle of wine.</t2913> <t2914>However, they were not miserable either.</t2914> <t2915>There was an unmistakable closeness in this scene, anyone could see that the two of them were plotting and scheming together.</t2915>
<t2916>As I tiptoed out from the porch, I heard the sound of a taxi and sensed it was driving down the dark road towards the house.</t2916> <t2917>Gatsby was still standing there, where I had left him on the road.</t2917>
<t2918>"Is it quiet up there now?" Gatsby asked anxiously.</t2918>
<t2919>"Yes, everything is silent now." I hesitated.</t2919> <t2920>"You'd better go home to sleep."</t2920>
<t2921>Gatsby shook his head.</t2921>
<t2922>"I want to wait here until Daisy goes to sleep.</t2922> <t2923>Goodbye, old friend."</t2923>
<t2924>Gatsby put his hands into his coat pockets and turned back to continue his watch, as if my presence would ruin the sanctity of what he was doing.</t2924> <t2925>Therefore, I left him standing under the moonlight, keeping watch over nothing.</t2925>
<t2926>Chapter 8</t2926>
<t2927>The entire night I couldn't sleep, the foghorn for ships at sea wailed continuously, echoing outside the strait.</t2927> <t2928>I tossed and turned as if in a half-sick state, caught between absurd truths and terrifying nightmares.</t2928> <t2929>As dawn approached, I heard the sound of a taxi driving into Gatsby's driveway, and I immediately jumped out of bed and got dressed.</t2929> <t2930>I felt I had to tell Gatsby something, to warn him.</t2930> <t2931>I feared that if I waited until morning, it would be too late.</t2931>
<t2932>As I passed by Gatsby's lawn, I saw that the front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hallway, immersed in either dejection or sleeplessness.</t2932>
<t2933>"Nothing happened." Gatsby said weakly.</t2933> <t2934>"I waited, around four o'clock Daisy came to the window and stood there for about a minute, then she turned off the light."</t2934>
<t2935>I felt that Gatsby's house had never seemed as monstrously gigantic as it did that night when we searched around the house for cigarettes.</t2935> <t2936>We lifted the large curtains like tent cloths, groping through countless feet of dark walls to find the light switches.</t2936> <t2937>At one point, I stumbled over the keys of the eerie grand piano.</t2937> <t2938>It was inexplicable how there was so much dust, covering everything, and the rooms were filled with a musty smell as if they hadn't been aired out for days.</t2938> <t2939>I found the cigarette box on an unfamiliar table with only two stale and dry cigarettes left.</t2939> <t2940>Throwing open the glass doors in the living room, we sat together smoking, letting the smoke drift into the darkness.</t2940>
<t2941>"You should go somewhere else." I said.</t2941> <t2942>"They will definitely trace it back to your car."</t2942>
<t2943>"Going out at THIS time, old friend?"</t2943>
<t2944>"Go to Atlantic City for about a week, or go up to Montreal, that's fine too."</t2944>
<t2945>However, Gatsby did not heed my advice.</t2945> <t2946>He could not leave Daisy at this moment until he knew what Daisy intended to do.</t2946> <t2947>Gatsby was holding onto a sliver of hope, and I couldn't bring myself to tell him to give up.</t2947>
<t2948>It was on this very evening that Gatsby recounted to me the strange story of his youth and Dan Cody - he told me this story because "Jay Gatsby" had now shattered like glass struck by the cruel malice of Tom, and the wild, absurd secret that had been concealed for so long was now considered exposed and concluded.</t2948> <t2949>I thought Gatsby would reveal everything, without any reservations, yet he only wanted to talk about Daisy.</t2949>
<t2950>Daisy was the first "proper" girl that Gatsby had ever known.</t2950> <t2951>In daily interactions, he had come into contact with such people, but it seemed as though there were always invisible barbed wires between him and them.</t2951> <t2952>Gatsby found Daisy very charming.</t2952> <t2953>At first, Gatsby went to Daisy's house with other officers from Camp Taylor, but later he went alone.</t2953> <t2954>Daisy's house overwhelmed him; Gatsby had never set foot in such a splendid house.</t2954> <t2955>But what truly took his breath away was not the house but the girl living in it, Daisy.</t2955> <t2956>Daisy lived there naturally and comfortably, just as Gatsby lived in his military camp.</t2956> <t2957>The house contained a ripe mystery.</t2957> <t2958>It evoked the impression that the bedrooms upstairs were more beautiful and cooler than other bedrooms, that joyful and cheerful parties took place along the corridors, that romantic affairs never withered but were kept fresh, always full of life, reminiscent of shiny motorcycles in the year and dance parties where the flowers never wilted.</t2958> <t2959>Another thing that made Gatsby even more interested and focused on Daisy was the fact that so many young men admired her, which in Gatsby's eyes only increased her value.</t2959> <t2960>Gatsby could feel the presence of these young men around the house, filling the air with their shadows and the echoes of their still-vivid emotions.</t2960>
<t2961>However, Gatsby knew that his entry into Daisy's house was merely a great coincidence.</t2961> <t2962>No matter how glorious and illustrious his future under the name Jay Gatsby might be, at that moment he was just a penniless young man, a person without roots, and at any time, the protective cloak of his military uniform could slip off his shoulders.</t2962> <t2963>Because of this, Gatsby enjoyed his time to the fullest.</t2963> <t2964>He tried to seize whatever he could at that moment, voraciously, without hesitation.</t2964> <t2965>And thus, he won Daisy over on a quiet October night, won Daisy because he had no legitimate right even to touch her hand.</t2965>
<t2966>Gatsby should have despised himself for having won Daisy through deceit.</t2966> <t2967>My point here is not that Gatsby won Daisy by trading his illusory millions, but by calculatingly giving Daisy a sense of security, making her believe that Gatsby was at least in the same social class as her and that he had the ability to protect her life.</t2967> <t2968>But the truth was not so; Gatsby did not possess those abilities, he did not have a well-off family supporting him, he had to rely on a capricious and inhumane government, and he could be sent away to any corner of the world.</t2968>
<t2969>However, Gatsby did not despise himself, and the situation did not unfold as he had imagined.</t2969> <t2970>His initial intention was merely to seize what he wanted and then make a swift getaway - but now he realized that he had plunged himself into a futile and arduous pursuit.</t2970> <t2971>Gatsby knew that Daisy was an exceptionally unusual girl, but he could not comprehend just how exceptionally unusual a "proper" girl could be.</t2971> <t2972>Daisy vanished into her wealthy home, into her affluent life of abundance, leaving Gatsby with nothing.</t2972> <t2973>Gatsby felt as if he had married Daisy, and that was all.</t2973>
<t2974>Two days after they met again, it was Gatsby who felt suffocated and believed he was the one betrayed.</t2974> <t2975>Daisy's porch was illuminated by luxurious furniture that shone like the stars.</t2975> <t2976>The wicker sofa creaked elegantly as Daisy turned towards Gatsby, and he kissed her lovely, sensual lips. At that moment, Daisy had a cold, making her voice even huskier and more charming than ever.</t2976> <t2977>Gatsby was stunned to realize that youth and mystery had been imprisoned and preserved in the wealth, the freshness of countless clothes, and Daisy, shimmering like silver, safe and proud above all the harsh struggles of men.</t2977>
<t2978>Poor times.</t2978>
<t2979>"Old friend, I can't describe to you how surprised I was when I discovered that I had fallen in love with Daisy. There was a time when I even hoped Daisy would leave me, but Daisy didn't do that because she loved me too.</t2979> <t2980>Daisy thought I was very knowledgeable because what I knew was different from what Daisy knew.</t2980> <t2981>That's how it was, that's the story, I surpassed my own ambitions, sinking deeper into love every moment, and suddenly I no longer cared about anything else.</t2981> <t2982>Doing great things in life no longer meant anything if I could tell Daisy what I wanted to do." One last afternoon before Gatsby was deployed overseas, Gatsby sat holding Daisy in his arms, for a long time, very quietly.</t2982> <t2983>That day was a cold autumn day, under the firelight of the fireplace in Daisy's house, her cheeks were rosy.</t2983> <t2984>Occasionally Daisy moved her body and Gatsby adjusted his arm a bit, once he kissed her dark, shiny hair.</t2984> <t2985>The afternoon made them quiet and serene, as if to imprint deep memories in their minds before the long separation of the next day.</t2985> <t2986>The two of them had never been closer in a month of loving each other, nor felt more deeply connected when Daisy placed her silent, wordless lips on Gatsby's coat shoulder, or when Gatsby gently and tenderly stroked Daisy's fingers as if she were sleeping.</t2986>
<t2987>Gatsby was promoted very quickly during the war.</t2987> <t2988>He was promoted to captain before going to the battlefield, and after the battles in Argonne, he was promoted to major, commanding the division's rifles.</t2988> <t2989>After the armistice, Gatsby tried every way to return home, but due to mistakes and complications, he was sent to Oxford.</t2989> <t2990>At this time, Gatsby was very worried, in the letters that Daisy sent him contained desperate anxieties.</t2990> <t2991>Daisy could not understand why he could not return home.</t2991> <t2992>Daisy felt a lot of pressure from the world around her and she wanted to meet Gatsby, to be by his side and to be reassured by him that what she was doing was right.</t2992>
<t2993>Daisy is still too young, the artificial world around her is always filled with the fragrant scent of orchids and brimming with joy, full of bustling pretensions, orchestras arranging rhythms for the entire year to summarize past sorrows and suggest new melodies for the life ahead.</t2993> <t2994>Throughout the night, the saxophone's wailing and lamenting the desperate sounds of the song BEALE STREET BLUES, while hundreds of golden and silver shoes kick up sparkling dust.</t2994> <t2995>At tea time, there are always rooms bustling endlessly in a gentle, sweet fever, while fresh faces glide from place to place like rose petals blown around the floor by the sad breath of trumpets.</t2995>
<t2996>In that twilight world, Daisy began to resume her activities as the season changed.</t2996> <t2997>Daisy suddenly accepted half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen young men, only to fall asleep at dawn with beads and evening gowns strewn haphazardly among the withered hyacinth flowers on the floor beside the bed.</t2997> <t2998>Yet, deep inside, Daisy was always driven by a yearning for a decision.</t2998> <t2999>Daisy wanted her life to be restructured - immediately - and that decision needed to have a power to be executed - a power that came from love, money, and practical certainty right beside her.</t2999>
<t3000>That strength came in the middle of spring when Tom Buchanan appeared.</t3000> <t3001>In Tom was a comprehensive inclusion of all aspects with a massive grandeur from the person, family background to status, which made Daisy feel proud.</t3001> <t3002>Undoubtedly, Daisy harbored internal conflicts along with a sense of relief.</t3002> <t3003>The letter reached Gatsby's hands while he was still studying at Oxford.</t3003>
<t3004>Dawn had arrived in Long Island, and we went around opening all the windows downstairs, filling the house with a light that was half pale gray and half golden yellow.</t3004> <t3005>The shadow of a tree lay stretched across the night mist, and ghostly birds sang among the green leaves.</t3005> <t3006>The atmosphere seemed to hold a gentle, slow movement, not a breeze, but a promise of a cool, pleasant, and beautiful new day.</t3006>
<t3007>"I don't think Daisy ever loved Tom." Gatsby turned away from a window and looked at me without acknowledgment.</t3007> <t3008>"Old sport, you must know that Daisy was very agitated yesterday afternoon.</t3008> <t3009>He said things with the intention of frightening Daisy and making me look like a despicable fraud.</t3009> <t3010>As a result, Daisy didn't know what she was saying.</t3010>
<t3011>Gatsby sat down, gloomy and melancholic.</t3011>
<t3012>"Perhaps she loved him for a moment when they first got married, but at that time Daisy still loved me more, did you notice that?".</t3012>
<t3013>Suddenly, Gatsby uttered a strange remark.</t3013>
<t3014>"In any case," he said. "It's just a personal matter."</t3014>
<t3015>What did I perceive through that statement, if not the doubt in Gatsby's mind, which was harboring intense and immeasurable emotions?</t3015>
<t3016>Gatsby returned from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their honeymoon.</t3016> <t3017>After that, he used the last wages he received from the army to make a painful but irresistible journey back to Louisville.</t3017> <t3018>Gatsby stayed there for a week, walking through the streets where the two of them had once strolled together on a November evening.</t3018> <t3019>He even visited farther places they had gone to in Daisy's white car.</t3019> <t3020>Just as Daisy's house was always more mysterious and joyful than other houses to Gatsby, his thoughts about this city were the same; although Daisy was no longer there, its beauty still carried a melancholic charm.</t3020>
<t3021>Gatsby left the city with the feeling that if he had tried harder, he could have found Daisy, that he was the one who abandoned Daisy.</t3021> <t3022>On the train - with an empty pocket - the weather was scorching hot.</t3022> <t3023>Gatsby went out to the train car corridor and sat down on a folding chair.</t3023> <t3024>The train station began to recede, gliding past unfamiliar buildings into the spring fields.</t3024> <t3025>A yellow tram raced alongside for about a minute, inside it were passengers who might have once glimpsed Daisy's ethereal, pale face on the street.</t3025>
<t3026>The tracks curved and the train was now turning its back on the sun, which was sinking lower and lower. It seemed to be bestowing blessings upon the city that was gradually fading away, the city that had once breathed life into Daisy. Gatsby stretched out his hand desperately as if trying to grasp, even just a small fragment of air, to hold onto a bit of space, the space that Daisy had made so beautiful for him.</t3026> <t3027>But now everything was slipping away too quickly for his dimming eyes, and Gatsby knew that he was losing part of it, losing the freshest, best part of it forever.</t3027>
<t3028>By nine in the morning, we had finished breakfast and stepped out onto the front porch.</t3028> <t3029>The night had passed, creating a clear difference in the weather, and the air was filled with the essence of autumn.</t3029> <t3030>The gardener, the last of Gatsby's old staff, approached the steps.</t3030>
<t3031>"I will drain the swimming pool today, Mr. Gatsby.</t3031> <t3032>The leaves are about to fall, and they will cause trouble for the pipes."</t3032>
<t3033>"Let's not do it today." Gatsby replied.</t3033> <t3034>He turned to me to explain.</t3034>
<t3035>"Old friend, you know, I haven't used the swimming pool all summer."</t3035>
<t3036>I looked at the clock and stood up.</t3036>
<t3037>"My train departs in twelve minutes."</t3037>
<t3038>I don't want to go into the city.</t3038> <t3039>I don't have the energy to work anymore, but the main thing is I don't want to leave Gatsby at this moment.</t3039> <t3040>I missed that train, then missed another one before I could muster the strength to leave.</t3040>
<t3041>"I will call you." Finally, I said.</t3041>
<t3042>"Remember to call, old friend."</t3042>
<t3043>"I will call you at noon."</t3043>
<t3044>We both walked slowly down the steps.</t3044>
<t3045>"I think Daisy will call me too." Gatsby looked at me with a puzzled expression, as if he wanted me to confirm what he said.</t3045>
<t3046>"I think so too."</t3046>
<t3047>"Goodbye for now."</t3047>
<t3048>We shook hands and I walked away.</t3048> <t3049>But just as I reached the fence, I suddenly remembered something and turned back.</t3049>
<t3050>"Those people are just a bunch of scoundrels." I shouted loudly across the grassy garden.</t3050> <t3051>"You are worth more than all of them put together."</t3051>
<t3052>I am always glad I said that sentence.</t3052> <t3053>It was the only compliment I ever gave Gatsby because from beginning to end I always disapproved of him.</t3053> <t3054>At first, Gatsby nodded politely and courteously, then his face lit up with a sympathetic smile as if we had always agreed on this matter.</t3054> <t3055>His beautiful pink suit, now wrinkled, formed a bright contrast next to the white stone steps, reminding me of the first night I came to his old mansion three months ago.</t3055>
<t3056>I thank Gatsby for his hospitality.</t3056> <t3057>All of us, myself and everyone else, thank Gatsby for this kindness.</t3057>
<t3058>"Goodbye." I said loudly. "Breakfast was delicious, Gatsby."</t3058>
<t3059>When I arrived in the city, I had to struggle for a while to record the prices of the stocks on the endlessly long price boards, then fell asleep on my swivel chair.</t3059> <t3060>The ringing phone woke me up around noon, I woke up startled with sweat all over my forehead.</t3060> <t3061>The caller was Jordan Baker, Jordan often called me at this time because Jordan frequently moved irregularly from one hotel to another, to clubs, and private houses, so this was the most convenient time to call.</t3061> <t3062>Usually, Jordan's voice over the phone sounded very cheerful and warm, like a small patch of grass from the green golf course being knocked up and landing on my office window. But this morning, that voice seemed harsh and dry.</t3062>
<t3063>khan.</t3063>
<t3064>"I have left Daisy's house." Jordan said.</t3064> <t3065>"I am now in Hempstead and I will go down to Southhampton this afternoon."</t3065>
<t3066>Perhaps leaving Daisy's house at this moment would be tactful. However, it made me feel uneasy and annoyed, and Jordan's next words left me frozen.</t3066>
<t3067>"Last night, you didn't treat me very well."</t3067>
<t3068>"At that moment, that matter wasn't important at all."</t3068>
<t3069>A prolonged silence ensued.</t3069> <t3070>Then:</t3070>
<t3071>"However - I want to meet you."</t3071>
<t3072>"I also want to meet you."</t3072>
<t3073>"What if you didn't go to Southampton but met me in town this afternoon?"</t3073>
<t3074>"No - I think this afternoon is not convenient."</t3074>
<t3075>"Alright."</t3075>
<t3076>"This afternoon is not possible.</t3076> <t3077>There are many...."</t3077>
<t3078>We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren't talking any longer.</t3078> <t3079>I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click, but I know I didn't care.</t3079> <t3080>I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world.</t3080>
<t3081>The two of us were talking nonsense for a while like that when suddenly I realized we were no longer talking.</t3081> <t3082>I don't clearly remember which one of us suddenly hung up first, but I don't need to know either.</t3082> <t3083>I couldn't talk to Jordan at the tea table that day if I was never going to talk to her again in this world.</t3083>
<t3084>A few minutes later, I called Gatsby's house, but the line was busy.</t3084> <t3085>I tried calling a total of four times, and finally, the irritated operator informed me that the line was busy with a long-distance call from Detroit.</t3085> <t3086>Taking out the train schedule, I circled the three-fifty train.</t3086> <t3087>Then I leaned back in my chair, trying to think.</t3087> <t3088>It was just noon.</t3088>
<t3089>That morning on the train, as we passed by the ash heaps, I deliberately avoided sitting on the other side of the carriage.</t3089> <t3090>I guessed that there was probably a curious crowd gathering around the place all day with little children searching for black spots in the dusty area, with some boastful, talkative man repeatedly recounting what had happened, telling the story over and over until it sounded less and less true, even to himself, and then he would stop telling it, and the tragedy of Myrtle Wilson would fade into oblivion.</t3090> <t3091>At this moment, I want to recount what happened at the repair shop after we left there the previous evening.</t3091>
<t3092>It was very difficult for people to find her younger sister Catherine.</t3092> <t3093>That night, she might have broken her own rule of not drinking alcohol because when she arrived, she was so drunk that she was unaware and not sober enough to understand that the ambulance had already taken the body to Flushing.</t3093> <t3094>By the time people made her believe what had just happened, she immediately fainted as if this part of the whole event was unbearable.</t3094> <t3095>Someone, whether out of curiosity or kindness, helped her into his car and took her to her sister's body.</t3095>
<t3096>Long past midnight, the crowd continued to gather around the front door of the repair shop, with one person replacing another as they left, while Wilson sat nodding off on the chair inside.</t3096> <t3097>The office door remained open for a long time, and those who entered the house could not resist glancing inside.</t3097> <t3098>Finally, someone remarked that it was shameful to do so, and thus the door was closed.</t3098> <t3099>Michaelis, along with several other men, stayed by Wilson's side; initially, there were four or five people, but eventually, only two or three remained.</t3099> <t3100>Eventually, Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to stay for about fifteen more minutes while he went back to his shop to brew a pot of coffee.</t3100> <t3101>After that, Michaelis stayed with Wilson until dawn.</t3101>
<t3102>Around three in the morning, Wilson's indistinct mumblings began to change.</t3102> <t3103>He became less talkative and started talking about the yellow car.</t3103> <t3104>He declared that he had a way to find out who owned that car and even blurted out that about two months ago, his wife came home from the street with a bruised face and a swollen nose.</t3104>
<t3105>However, when he himself heard the words he was saying, he became hesitant and began to shout again, "Oh, my God!" in a moaning voice.</t3105> <t3106>Michaelis awkwardly tried to find a way to make him forget about it.</t3106>
<t3107>"How long have you been married, George?" Listen here, try to sit still for a minute and answer my question.</t3107> <t3108>How long have you been married?"</t3108>
<t3109>"Twelve years."</t3109>
<t3110>"Do you have any children?</t3110> <t3111>Listen here George, sit still so I can ask you a question.</t3111> <t3112>Do you have any children?"</t3112>
<t3113>The brown beetles kept crashing into the dim light, and every time he heard the sound of a car passing by outside, Michaelis thought it was the car that had refused to stop a few hours earlier.</t3113> <t3114>He didn't want to go into the garage because the desk was still stained with blood where the body had lain.</t3114> <t3115>So he had to move uncomfortably around the office.</t3115> <t3116>It wasn't yet dawn, but Michaelis had become familiar with every item in the room - occasionally he would sit down next to Wilson, trying to calm him down.</t3116>
<t3117>"Do you often go to church anywhere, George? Even those churches that you haven't visited for a long time?"</t3117> <t3118>"Or should I call a church and invite a priest to come and talk to you, is that okay?"</t3118>
<t3119>"I don't follow any church."</t3119>
<t3120>"You should belong to a church, George, for situations like this.</t3120> <t3121>You must have gone to church at least once.</t3121> <t3122>Did you get married in a church, George? Listen here, George, listen to my question.</t3122> <t3123>Did you get married in a church?"</t3123>
<t3124>"That happened a long time ago."</t3124>
<t3125>The effort to answer the questions disrupted Wilson's nodding rhythm, and he became quiet for a moment.</t3125> <t3126>But then the half-understanding, half-confused look reappeared in his cloudy eyes.</t3126>
<t3127>"Look inside that drawer over there." He said, pointing towards the desk.</t3127>
<t3128>"Which drawer?"</t3128>
<t3129>"That drawer - yes, that one."</t3129>
<t3130>Michaelis opened the drawer closest to him.</t3130> <t3131>Inside the drawer, there was nothing except for an expensive dog collar, made of leather and trimmed with silver.</t3131> <t3132>It looked very new.</t3132>
<t3133>"Is this it?" Michaelis asked, picking it up.</t3133>
<t3134>Wilson stared and nodded.</t3134>
<t3135>"I found it yesterday.</t3135> <t3136>She tried to explain it to me, but I knew something was wrong."</t3136>
<t3137>"Do you mean your wife bought it?"</t3137>
<t3138>"She wrapped the words in thin paper and placed them on the vanity table."</t3138>
<t3139>Michaelis didn't find anything strange about this; he gave a dozen reasons why Wilson's wife might buy a dog collar.</t3139> <t3140>Perhaps Wilson had also heard similar explanations from Myrtle, because he started moaning "Oh my God!" again, causing the person comforting him to abandon other explanations that hadn't yet been said.</t3140>
<t3141>"So he killed my wife." Wilson said, his mouth suddenly gaping open.</t3141>
<t3142>"Who did it?"</t3142>
<t3143>"I have a way to find out."</t3143>
<t3144>"Your mind is not clear, George," Michaelis said.</t3144> <t3145>"This situation has exhausted you and you no longer know what you are saying.</t3145> <t3146>You should try to rest until morning."</t3146>
<t3147>"He has plotted against my wife."</t3147>
<t3148>"It was just an accident, George."</t3148>
<t3149>Wilson shook his head.</t3149> <t3150>His eyes narrowed, and his mouth opened slightly to utter a "Hmm."</t3150>
<t3151>"I know." Wilson said decisively.</t3151> <t3152>"I am one of those who easily trust people, and I never think ill of anyone, but when I figure something out, it is correct.</t3152> <t3153>It was the guy sitting in that car.</t3153> <t3154>She ran out to talk to him but he refused to stop."</t3154>
<t3155>Michaelis also witnessed that scene, but he did not think there was anything particularly unusual about it.</t3155> <t3156>He believed that Wilson's wife was running away from her husband rather than trying to stop any car.</t3156>
<t3157>"Why does your wife have to do that?"</t3157>
<t3158>"She is a profound and thoughtful person." Wilson replied, as if that was an answer. "A...."</t3158>
<t3159>He started trembling all over again.</t3159> <t3160>Michaelis stood fidgeting with the dog's collar in his hand.</t3160>
<t3161>"Or do you have a friend somewhere that I can call for you, George?"</t3161>
<t3162>This was just a vain hope because Michaelis was almost certain that Wilson had no friends at all; he devoted himself entirely to his wife, and that was not enough.</t3162> <t3163>A moment later, Michaelis felt relieved when he noticed a change in the room, a blue hue spreading from the window, and he realized that dawn was not far away.</t3163> <t3164>By around five o'clock, the blue light was sufficient to turn off the lamp.</t3164>
<t3165>Wilson's vacant eyes stared out at the ash heaps, where clouds of gray dust were forming into a grotesque shape and being scattered by the faint dawn breeze.</t3165>
<t3166>"I told her." Wilson muttered, after a long silence.</t3166> <t3167>"I told her that she could deceive me but she couldn't deceive God.</t3167> <t3168>I dragged her to the window." With an effort, he stood up, walked to the window, and pressed his face against the window frame. "And told her 'God knows what you're doing, knows everything you're doing.</t3168> <t3169>You can deceive me, but you can't deceive God.'</t3169>
<t3170>Standing right behind Wilson, Michaelis was astonished to realize that he was looking up at the enormous pale blue eyes of Dr. T. J.</t3170> <t3171>Eckleburg, which had just appeared in the vanishing darkness.</t3171>
<t3172>"God sees everything." Wilson repeated.</t3172>
<t3173>"It's just a billboard." Michaelos reassured Wilson.</t3173> <t3174>There was something that made him turn his head away from the window and only look inside the room.</t3174> <t3175>However, Wilson still stood there for a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding towards the dim darkness.</t3175>
<t3176>By around six in the morning, Michaelis had become exhausted, and he was relieved to hear the sound of a car stopping outside.</t3176> <t3177>It was one of the men who had kept watch the previous night and had promised to return.</t3177> <t3178>He prepared breakfast for three people, but only he and the other man ate together.</t3178> <t3179>Wilson had calmed down, so Michaelis went back to his own house to sleep.</t3179> <t3180>Four hours later, when he woke up and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was already gone.</t3180>
<t3181>Wilson's movement - entirely on foot - was eventually traced to Roosevelt Harbor and then to Gal's Hill.</t3181> <t3182>There he bought a meat pie but did not eat it, and a</t3182>
<t3183>a cup of coffee.</t3183> <t3184>Perhaps he was very tired and walked very slowly, so it wasn't until noon that he reached Gas's Hill. By that time, tracking what he had done wasn't very difficult.</t3184> <t3185>The little children said they saw a man "acting crazy."</t3185> <t3186>People driving by said they saw him sitting by the road staring at them in a strange way.</t3186> <t3187>But then, for about three hours, he disappeared and no one saw him.</t3187> <t3188>The police, based on what Wilson had told Michaelis that he "had a way to find out," believed he spent that time going around to various garages asking about the yellow car.</t3188> <t3189>However, no mechanic who had met him came forward to report it.</t3189> <t3190>Perhaps he had an easier and more certain way to find what he was looking for.</t3190> <t3191>Around two-thirty, Wilson appeared in West Egg.</t3191> <t3192>There, he asked people around for directions to Gatsby's house.</t3192> <t3193>That was when he learned Gatsby's name.</t3193>
<t3194>At two o'clock, Gatsby changed into his swimming suit and left a message with the butler that if anyone called, they should find him at the swimming pool.</t3194> <t3195>Gatsby stopped by the garage to get the inflatable mattress, which had been a source of entertainment for his guests all summer long.</t3195> <t3196>The driver helped Gatsby inflate the mattress.</t3196> <t3197>Gatsby also instructed that the car should not be taken out under any circumstances - This was a bit strange because the right front fender needed to be repaired.</t3197>
<t3198>Gatsby shouldered the swimming mattress and walked towards the lake.</t3198> <t3199>He stopped once to adjust it a bit, the chauffeur asked if Gatsby wanted his help, but Gatsby shook his head and after a moment disappeared among the rows of yellow leaves.</t3199>
<t3200>No phone call came, yet the butler still did not sleep and he kept waiting like that until four in the afternoon - until if the phone did ring, there would be no one left for him to report to.</t3200> <t3201>I suppose even Gatsby himself did not believe he would get a call, or perhaps he no longer wanted to know.</t3201> <t3202>If that were true, he must have felt that he had lost the cozy world of before, that he had paid too high a price to live too long in just one dream.</t3202> <t3203>He surely looked up at the unfamiliar sky through the trembling and fearful leaves as he realized how absurdly grotesque the rose looked, how harsh the sunlight shone on the sparse grass.</t3203> <t3204>A new world, where material things were unreal, where miserable ghosts were breathing dreams like breathing air, drifting aimlessly...</t3204> <t3205>Like that strange gray figure sliding towards him through the shapeless trees.</t3205>
<t3206>The driver, one of the people sponsored by Wolfsheim, heard the gunshots.</t3206> <t3207>But later he only testified that at the time he didn't think it was anything serious.</t3207> <t3208>I drove straight from the train station to Gatsby's house, the way I anxiously hurried up the front steps was the first alarm for everyone.</t3208> <t3209>It was only then that they knew, I am sure of it.</t3209> <t3210>Without saying a word, the four of us, including the driver, the butler, the gardener, and myself, hurried out to the pool.</t3210>
<t3211>The water surface ripples very gently, almost imperceptibly, as new water is introduced from one side of the lake and pushed towards the drain on the other side.</t3211> <t3212>The small ripples are not enough to form waves that could push the heavy buoy drifting erratically to the end of the lake.</t3212> <t3213>A strong wind blows across, not enough to wrinkle the water surface but enough to disturb its random path with its random burden.</t3213> <t3214>A cluster of floating leaves touches it, causing it to slowly spin like a compass needle drawing a red circle on the water surface.</t3214>
<t3215>It was only after we brought Gatsby's body into the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body lying far away on the lawn, and thus the story of the mass killing came to an end.</t3215>

<t3218>Chapter 9</t3218>
<t3219>Two years have passed, and the only thing I can remember from that day, that night, and the following day is the constant coming and going of police officers, photographers, and journalists in front of Gatsby's house.</t3219> <t3220>A rope was stretched across the main gate, and a policeman stood beside it, preventing curious onlookers from approaching.</t3220> <t3221>But it wasn't long before the children discovered that they could sneak into the house from my garden.</t3221> <t3222>And so, after that, there were always at least a few of them gathered around the pool, standing with their mouths agape.</t3222> <t3223>That afternoon, a man, perhaps a detective, with a determined demeanor, used the term "madman" to describe Wilson as he bent down to look at the body.</t3223> <t3224>His voice, carrying an air of incidental authority, set the tone for the newspaper reports the following morning.</t3224>
<t3225>Most of those articles were equally terrible, containing absurdity, self-interpretation, and falsehoods.</t3225> <t3226>When Michaelis's testimony during the inquest revealed that Wilson had suspicions about his wife, I thought that soon the entire story would be presented in the press as a sensational and thrilling libel.</t3226> <t3227>However, Catherine, who could have said something, did not utter a single word.</t3227> <t3228>She displayed a surprising determination and looked at the coroner with resolute eyes under her redrawn eyebrows.</t3228> <t3229>She swore that her sister had never met Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, and that her sister was not involved in any shady business.</t3229> <t3230>Catherine made herself believe in what she was saying, then buried her face in her handkerchief and cried, as if she couldn't bear any other hypothesis.</t3230> <t3231>Therefore, to simplify the case as much as possible, Wilson was reduced to being merely considered "mentally deranged by grief."</t3231> <t3232>And then the case was closed there.</t3232>
<t3233>However, all these developments seemed too distant and non-essential.</t3233> <t3234>I was beside Gatsby, only me alone.</t3234> <t3235>From the moment I called to report this tragedy to the village of West Egg, all speculation about Gatsby or any related questions were directed at me.</t3235>
<t3236>At first, I felt surprised and confused, but then, while Gatsby was lying in the house, motionless, not breathing, not speaking, hour after hour, I gradually felt that I had to take responsibility because no one else cared.</t3236> <t3237>Caring, I mean the warm personal concern that everyone is entitled to at the end of their life, even if it's just vaguely.</t3237>
<t3238>About an hour and a half after finding Gatsby's body, I instinctively and without hesitation called to find Daisy.</t3238> <t3239>However, Daisy and Tom had left the house early that afternoon, taking all their luggage with them.</t3239>
<t3240>"Didn't leave any contact address?"</t3240>
<t3241>"No."</t3241>
<t3242>"Did they say when they would come back?"</t3242>
<t3243>"No."</t3243>
<t3244>"Do you know where they are now?"</t3244> <t3245>"How can I contact them?"</t3245>
<t3246>"I don't know either.</t3246> <t3247>Don't know anything but still talk."</t3247>
<t3248>I want to find some people to come to Gatsby.</t3248> <t3249>I want to go into the room where he is lying and assure him: "I will go find someone to come here with you, Gatsby.</t3249> <t3250>Don't worry. Trust me, I will find someone..."</t3250>
<t3251>Meyer Wolfsheim's name was not listed in the phone directory.</t3251> <t3252>The butler gave me the address of his office on Broadway.</t3252> <t3253>I called the operator, but by the time the line connected, it was already past five in the afternoon, and no one at the office answered the phone.</t3253>
<t3254>"Could you please call again?"</t3254>
<t3255>"I have called three times already."</t3255>
<t3256>"This is of utmost importance."</t3256>
<t3257>"Sorry, but no one was there."</t3257>
<t3258>I returned to the living room and at that moment thought that there were guests who happened to drop by, but it turned out that the people entering the house were all officials.</t3258> <t3259>When these people lifted the cloth covering Gatsby and stared at him with indifferent eyes, Gatsby's pleas continued to echo in my mind.</t3259>
<t3260>"Listen here, old friend, you have to try to find someone for me.</t3260> <t3261>You have to try even harder.</t3261> <t3262>I can't leave in such loneliness."</t3262>
<t3263>Someone asked me some questions, but I avoided them and hurriedly went upstairs to search through Gatsby's unlocked desk drawers.</t3263> <t3264>He had never clearly told me whether his parents had passed away.</t3264> <t3265>I found nothing - except for a picture of Dan Cody, symbolizing a forgotten turbulent past, staring down from the wall.</t3265>
<t3266>The next morning, I sent the butler to New York to deliver a letter to Wolfsheim, asking for news and telling him to take the next train.</t3266> <t3267>When writing the letter, I realized that my request was redundant; I was certain he would come here immediately once he read the news in the paper, just as I was certain Daisy would wire back before noon.</t3267> <t3268>However, neither the telegram nor Wolfsheim arrived.</t3268> <t3269>No one stopped by except for the police, photographers, and reporters. When the butler returned with Wolfsheim's reply, I began to develop a feeling of both defiance and contempt, shared by both Gatsby and me, towards all of them.</t3269>
<t3270>Dear Mr. Carraway.</t3270>
<t3271>This is one of the most terrible incidents in my life; even now, I still can't believe it's true.</t3271> <t3272>The crazy actions of that person make all of us think.</t3272> <t3273>I can't go there right now because I am busy with important work and cannot let it be disrupted at this moment.</t3273> <t3274>If there is anything you need my help with later, let me know by writing a letter and giving it to Edgar.</t3274> <t3275>I no longer remember where I was when I heard this news, and I am still in shock.</t3275>
<t3276>Respectfully yours</t3276>
<t3277>MEYER WOLFSHIEM</t3277>
<t3278>Below the letter, he hastily added a postscript:</t3278>
<t3279>Let me know the news about the funeral, etc.</t3279> <t3280>I don't know anything about his family.</t3280>
<t3281>That afternoon when the phone rang and the long-distance operator announced that the call was from Chicago, I thought that Daisy had finally called me</t3281>
<t3282>i.</t3282> <t3283>But when the line was reconnected, it was the voice of a man, sounding very small and distant.</t3283>
<t3284>"This is Sladge..."</t3284>
<t3285>"What's going on?" This person's name sounds unfamiliar to me.</t3285>
<t3286>"The telegram is quite sensational, isn't it?</t3286> <t3287>Have you received my telegram yet?"</t3287>
<t3288>"Haven't received any telegrams yet."</t3288>
<t3289>"The young guy Parker is in trouble." The person on the phone said quickly.</t3289> <t3290>"The police caught the kid while he was handing out the bonds at the counter.</t3290> <t3291>They received information from New York about those numbers just five minutes earlier.</t3291> <t3292>Hey, do you know anything about this?</t3292> <t3293>You can never predict these small towns..."</t3293>
<t3294>"Hello!" I interrupted, speaking as if out of breath.</t3294> <t3295>"Listen, I'm not Gatsby.</t3295> <t3296>Gatsby has passed away."</t3296>
<t3297>On the other end of the line, there was a sudden silence for a long moment, followed by a sigh... then a sharp click as the phone was hung up.</t3297>
<t3298>I remember around the third day, a telegram was sent from a city in the state of Minnesota, signed Henry C. Gatz.</t3298> <t3299>The telegram simply stated that the sender was immediately setting out on a journey, requesting the funeral to be postponed.</t3299>
<t3300>That person was Gatsby's father, a dignified old man who looked very bewildered and dispirited.</t3300> <t3301>The old man wore a long, cheap overcoat despite the sweltering September weather, with tears continuously falling from his emotional eyes.</t3301> <t3302>When I took the basket and umbrella from his hands, he kept tugging at his sparse white beard, making it difficult for me to remove his coat.</t3302> <t3303>The old man seemed on the verge of collapsing, so I led him into the music room to sit and rest for a long while as I called for someone to bring him some food.</t3303> <t3304>However, he did not eat or drink anything, and the milk spilled over his trembling hand.</t3304>
<t3305>"I read this news in the Chicago newspaper." The old man said.</t3305> <t3306>"This news was fully reported in the Chicago newspaper."</t3306> <t3307>"I hurried here immediately."</t3307>
<t3308>"I didn't know how to find you." The old man's eyes kept moving around the room, but it seemed like he couldn't see anything.</t3308>
<t3309>"That guy is a madman.</t3309> <t3310>He is definitely a madman," the old man said.</t3310>
<t3311>"Would you like some coffee?" I insisted.</t3311>
<t3312>"I don't need anything.</t3312> <t3313>I'm fine, you...."</t3313>
<t3314>"Carraway."</t3314>
<t3315>"I'm feeling better now.</t3315> <t3316>Where did they put Jimmy?" I took the old man to the living room where his son was lying and left him there.</t3316> <t3317>A few small children crowded around the steps to look inside the house, and when I told them who had arrived, they reluctantly left.</t3317>
<t3318>A moment later, Mr. Gatz opened the door and went outside, his mouth agape, his face slightly red, and his eyes shedding solitary, belated tears.</t3318> <t3319>He had reached an age where death no longer surprised or terrified him, and as he stood looking around for the first time, seeing the grand, magnificent foyer and the large rooms extending from one to another, his sorrow began to mix with an astonished pride.</t3319> <t3320>I helped him up to the bedroom upstairs.</t3320> <t3321>As he took off his outer coat and inner coat, I informed him that the funeral had been postponed to await his arrival.</t3321>
<t3322>"I don't know what you need, Mr. Gatsby.."</t3322>
<t3323>"My last name is Gatz."</t3323>
<t3324>"Mr. Gatz.</t3324> <t3325>I think you might want to take the body back to the West."</t3325>
<t3326>Mr. Gatz shook his head.</t3326>
<t3327>"Jimmy always preferred the East.</t3327> <t3328>He achieved his current position thanks to the East. Are you a friend of my son, you....</t3328><t3329>?"</t3329>
<t3330>"We are best friends."</t3330>
<t3331>"My child still has a bright future ahead, you know that.</t3331> <t3332>He is still a young man, but he is full of spiritual strength right here."</t3332>
<t3333>The old man touched his head in a very emotional manner.</t3333> <t3334>I nodded.</t3334>
<t3335>"If it were still alive, it would be a great person.</t3335> <t3336>A person like James J. Hill.</t3336> <t3337>It could have helped build the nation."</t3337>
<t3338>"That's right." I replied somewhat unnaturally and uncomfortably.</t3338>
<t3339>The old man reached out to feel the embroidered bedspread, pulled it up, then lay down straight and immediately fell asleep,</t3339>
<t3340>That night, someone called, and he clearly seemed frightened and demanded to know who I was before revealing his name.</t3340>
<t3341>"My name is Carraway." I replied.</t3341>
<t3342>"Oh!" The man's voice sounded noticeably relieved.</t3342> <t3343>"I am Klipspringer." Hearing this, I also felt relieved and comfortable, knowing that there would be one more person attending Gatsby's funeral.</t3343> <t3344>I didn't want to publish an obituary in the newspaper, as it would attract a crowd of curious onlookers who would come just to see the scene, so I made phone calls to a few people myself.</t3344> <t3345>Finding these people was really difficult.</t3345>
<t3346>"The funeral is tomorrow." I said.</t3346> <t3347>"Three o'clock in the afternoon, here at this house.</t3347> <t3348>I hope you can pass the message to others who want to know."</t3348>
<t3349>"Alright, I'll do it." He hurriedly interrupted.</t3349> <t3350>"I'm not sure if I'll meet anyone, but if I do, I'll pass the message."</t3350>
<t3351>His voice made me suspicious.</t3351>
<t3352>"But of course, you will come, won't you?"</t3352>
<t3353>"Well, let's see, I will definitely try my best.</t3353> <t3354>The reason I'm calling now is..."</t3354>
<t3355>"Wait a moment." I interrupted.</t3355> <t3356>"How about just saying that you will come?"</t3356>
<t3357>"Well, to be honest, I'm with some people in Greenwich and they want me to go with them tomorrow.</t3357> <t3358>It seems like a picnic or something.</t3358> <t3359>Of course, I will do my best to find a way to back out."</t3359>
<t3360>I couldn't stop myself from exclaiming "Hmph," and he surely heard me, so he continued speaking in a flustered manner.</t3360>
<t3361>"The reason I called is because I left a pair of shoes there.</t3361> <t3362>I don't know if it would be too much trouble for you to have the housekeeper send them back to me.</t3362> <t3363>You know, those shoes are tennis shoes, and without them, we would be in a lot of trouble.</t3363> <t3364>Send them to me under the recipient name B. F...."</t3364>
<t3365>I couldn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the phone immediately.</t3365>
<t3366>After that event, I felt ashamed for Gatsby.</t3366> <t3367>A man who answered when I called hinted that Gatsby deserved what happened to him.</t3367> <t3368>However, it was indeed my fault, because that man was someone who regularly drank the liquor at Gatsby's house to muster the courage to bitterly mock him.</t3368> <t3369>I should have remembered that and not called him.</t3369>
<t3370>On the morning of the funeral, I went to New York to meet Meyer Wolfsheim; otherwise, I truly had no other option.</t3370> <t3371>Following the directions of the elevator boy, I pushed open the door marked "Swatika Company," and it seemed there was no one inside.</t3371> <t3372>But when I loudly called "hello" several times, almost in vain, I heard arguing behind a screen. Then a beautiful Jewish woman appeared from the inner door, scrutinizing me with unfriendly dark eyes.</t3372>
<t3373>"There is no one here, Mr. Wolfsheim has gone to Chicago." She said.</t3373>
<t3374>The first part of the statement is clearly incorrect, because at that moment there was the sound of someone whistling off-key to the tune of "The Rosary" inside.</t3374>
<t3375>"Please let him know that Mr. Carraway is here to see him."</t3375>
<t3376>"I have no way to make him come back from Chicago."</t3376>
<t3377>At that moment, a voice called out from behind the door, "Stella!" There was no mistaking it, it was Wolfsheim's voice.</t3377>
<t3378>"Just leave your business card on the table, I will hand it to him once he returns." She said hurriedly.</t3378>
<t3379>"But I know he is in there."</t3379>
<t3380>She took another step towards me, her hands moving up and down her hips in anger.</t3380>
<t3381>"Young people like you think you can barge in here anytime you want." She scolded.</t3381>
<t3382>"We are really too fed up and tired of this kind of thing already."</t3382> <t3383>"When I say he is in Chicago, he is indeed in Chicago."</t3383>
<t3384>I mentioned Gatsby's name.</t3384>
<t3385>"Oh....." She looked at me once more.</t3385> <t3386>"If that's the case, then please....</t3386> <t3387>What is your name?"</t3387>
<t3388>She immediately disappeared, and a moment later Meyer Wolfsheim appeared, standing solemnly at the door, extending both hands to welcome me.</t3388> <t3389>He led me into the office, speaking to me with great respect, saying that this was a time of sorrow for everyone.</t3389> <t3390>Then he offered me a cigar.</t3390>
<t3391>"I still remember the first time I met him.</t3391> <t3392>At that time, he was a recently discharged major, still wearing all the medals he had earned in the war.</t3392> <t3393>He was so poor that he couldn't afford civilian clothes and had to keep wearing his military uniform.</t3393> <t3394>The first time I met him was when he came to the Winebrenner billiard hall on Forty Street to ask for a job.</t3394> <t3395>He hadn't eaten anything for two or three days.</t3395> <t3396>I invited him to 'come have lunch with me'.</t3396> <t3397>In just half an hour, he had eaten four dollars' worth of food."</t3397>
<t3398>"Did you help him start his career</t3398><t3399>?" I probed.</t3399>
<t3400>"Help him get started? Actually, I was the one who built him up."</t3400>
<t3401>"Oh"</t3401>
<t3402>"I pulled him up from nothing, dragged him out of the gutter.</t3402> <t3403>I immediately recognized that he was a handsome, courteous young man, and when he said he had studied at Oxford, I knew I had a place to use him.</t3403> <t3404>I got him to join the American Legion, where he held a very high position.</t3404> <t3405>At the beginning, he worked for one of my clients in Albany.</t3405>
<t3406>"We have been close like this in everything." Wolfsheim raised his two banana-shaped fingers, "always side by side."</t3406>
<t3407>I wonder in my heart whether that cooperation between the two included arranging the 1919 football championship in advance.</t3407>
<t3408>"Now he has passed away." After a moment, I said.</t3408> <t3409>"You were Gatsby's closest friend, so I know you will want to attend Gatsby's funeral this afternoon."</t3409>
<t3410>"I really want to attend."</t3410>
<t3411>"In that case, just go."</t3411>
<t3412>The tuft of hair in his nose quivered slightly, and he shook his head, his eyes glistening with tears.</t3412>
<t3413>"I can't go - I can't get involved." He said.</t3413>
<t3414>"There is nothing involved.</t3414> <t3415>Everything is over."</t3415>
<t3416>"When someone is killed, I never want to get involved.</t3416> <t3417>I stay away.</t3417> <t3418>When I was younger, I was different; back then, if a friend of mine died, no matter the cost, I would stay with them until the end.</t3418> <t3419>You might consider that sentimental, but it really was like that; I stayed with them until the bitter end."</t3419>
<t3420>I realized that for some personal reason, he definitely would not attend the funeral, so I stood up.</t3420>
<t3421>"An</t3421>
<t3422>"Have you gone to college yet?" Wolfsheim suddenly asked.</t3422>
<t3423>For a moment, I thought he wanted to propose a "business deal," but he just nodded and shook my hand.</t3423>
<t3424>"We should express our feelings to a person while he is still alive, not after he has died," he advised.</t3424> <t3425>"Other than that, my principle is not to get involved in anything."</t3425>
<t3426>When I left Wolfsheim's office, the sky had already darkened, and I returned to West Egg in the drizzle.</t3426> <t3427>After changing clothes, I went next door and found Mr. Gatz pacing back and forth in the house, agitated.</t3427> <t3428>His pride in his son and what he had accomplished kept growing.</t3428>
<t3429>Now you have something to show me.</t3429>
<t3430>"Jimmy sent me this picture." The old man took a wallet out of his pocket with trembling fingers.</t3430>
<t3431>"Look at this."</t3431>
<t3432>That is a picture of Gatsby's mansion, the corner of the picture is torn and dirty with many fingerprints.</t3432> <t3433>The old man eagerly pointed out every detail in the picture to me.</t3433> <t3434>"Look here." He said while looking into my eyes, searching for admiration in them.</t3434> <t3435>He had shown the picture so many times that I thought to him the picture might be more real than the actual mansion outside.</t3435>
<t3436>"Jimmy sent this picture to me."</t3436> <t3437>"I think this picture is very beautiful."</t3437> <t3438>"It is very sharp."</t3438>
<t3439>"Yes, very distinctive."</t3439> <t3440>"Have you seen him recently?"</t3440>
<t3441>"It visited me about two years ago and bought me the house I am living in now.</t3441> <t3442>Of course, when it left home, our family was still very poor, but now looking back, I understand that it left for a reason.</t3442> <t3443>My son saw a bright future ahead of him.</t3443> <t3444>Then, after becoming successful, he was very generous with me."</t3444>
<t3445>The old man reluctantly did not want to put away the picture, trying to hold it for one more minute, lingering to hold it in front of me.</t3445> <t3446>Then he put the picture into his wallet, pulling out from his pocket an old, worn, and tattered notebook titled "HOPALONG CASSIDY".</t3446>
<t3447>"Look here, this book was his when he was little, proving what kind of person he is."</t3447>
<t3448>The old man opened the book from the back cover, then turned it around and handed it to me to see.</t3448> <t3449>On the last page of the book, the words "schedule" were written, and the date recorded there was September 12, 1906.</t3449> <t3450>Below that, it was written:</t3450>
<t3451>Waking up................ 6:00 A.</t3451> <t3452>M.</t3452>

<t3467>"I happened to find this notebook.</t3467> <t3468>It shows what kind of person my child is."</t3468>
<t3469>The old man said.</t3469>
<t3470>"You are right."</t3470>
<t3471>"Jimmy is someone who definitely has to rise up.</t3471> <t3472>He always has that determination.</t3472> <t3473>Did you notice what he wrote about what needs to be done to develop his mind?</t3473> <t3474>He has always been excellent at that.</t3474> <t3475>Once he called me as dumb as a pig, and I hit him for daring to say that."</t3475>
<t3476>The old man reluctantly did not want to close the notebook, kept reading each part aloud, then turned to look at me eagerly.</t3476> <t3477>I think he hoped that I would copy what was in the notebook to use for myself.</t3477>
<t3478>Around nearly three o'clock, the Protestant minister arrived from Flushing.</t3478> <t3479>I began to look out the window uncontrollably to see if any other cars were coming.</t3479> <t3480>Gatsby's father did the same.</t3480> <t3481>Time passed by like that, as the household servants gathered and stood in a line inside, at which point the old man's eyes started blinking, showing signs of impatience, anxiously remarking indistinctly if it would rain.</t3481> <t3482>The minister glanced at his watch many times, so I pulled him aside to ask him to wait for another half hour.</t3482> <t3483>But it didn't help at all.</t3483> <t3484>No one came.</t3484>
<t3485>Around five o'clock, our three cars arrived at the cemetery, stopping by the gate under a misty drizzle.</t3485> <t3486>Leading the way was the black and soaked hearse, followed by Mr. Gatz, the priest, and me in the limousine, a bit further behind were about four or five servants and mail carriers from West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all of them drenched like drowned rats.</t3486> <t3487>As we began to step through the cemetery gate, I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone's footsteps splashing on the waterlogged ground.</t3487> <t3488>I looked around.</t3488> <t3489>The newcomer was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had once seen standing in awe before Gatsby's books one evening three months ago.</t3489>
<t3490>Since that time, I have not seen him again.</t3490> <t3491>I do not know why he knew about the funeral, I don't even know his name.</t3491> <t3492>Raindrops trickled down his thick glasses, he took them off and wiped them dry so he could see the cloth covering the grave being opened.</t3492>
<t3493>I tried to concentrate my thoughts to remember Gatsby for a moment, he had gone too far already.</t3493> <t3494>I could only recall, without a hint of resentment, that Daisy had never sent a message or a flower.</t3494> <t3495>I heard someone murmuring indistinctly, "Blessings be upon the deceased when rain falls on their grave." Then the owl-eyed man said "Amen" in a resolute voice.</t3495>
<t3496>We struggled to quickly get to the car in the rain.</t3496> <t3497>Mr. Sharp-Eyed told me as we reached the cemetery gate.</t3497>
<t3498>"I couldn't make it home in time." He explained.</t3498>
<t3499>"No one came either."</t3499>
<t3500>"Is that so." He was astonished. "Oh my, why, the people who frequent that place usually number in the hundreds." He took off his glasses to clean them once more from the inside out.</t3500>
<t3501>"So miserable." He said.</t3501>
<t3502>One of the most vivid and profound memories in me is the times when I returned home in the West for Christmas holidays from preparatory school, and later from university.</t3502> <t3503>Students whose homes were farther than the city of Chicago would gather together at six o'clock in the evening on a December day under the dim lights of the old Union Station train station. There were also a few friends from Chicago, who were ready to join in their own holiday festivities, present at the platform to bid a hasty farewell to their friends.</t3503> <t3504>I still remember the image of fur coats worn by female students returning home from the women's dormitories, the chattering voices from breaths that had turned into mist, and the hands raised high above their heads waving as they caught sight of familiar faces from before.</t3504> <t3505>Then the invitations to respond, "Are you going to the Ordways' family?</t3505> <t3506>Or the Herseys' family?</t3506> <t3507>Or the Schultzes' family?" After that, the long green train tickets were tightly held in our gloved hands.</t3507> <t3508>Finally, the image of the yellow train cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul lines, looking as cheerful as Christmas Eve, lying on the tracks next to the platform gate.</t3508>
<t3509>When our train plunged into the winter night, the white snow—yes, the very real snow of our homeland—began to stretch out on both sides of the tracks, reflecting and sparkling through the train's windows.</t3509><t3510>The flickering lights of the small stations in Wisconsin quickly passed by, and a wave of thrilling excitement suddenly filled the air.</t3510><t3511>We took a deep breath of that air as we walked back to our seats from dinner, passing through the cold corridors.</t3511><t3512>In this brief and strange hour, we became aware, in an indescribable way, of our distinct characteristics compared to this homeland before we would be indistinguishably blended into it.</t3512>
<t3513>That is my Midwestern homeland, not the wheat fields, or the meadows, or the remote Swedish towns, but the emotionally charged train journeys that take me back to my childhood, to the streetlights, the sleigh bells of horse-drawn sleds in the cold dark night, and the shadows of holiday wreaths hanging on doors, illuminated on the white snow from the brightly lit windows.</t3513>
<t3514>I am a part of those things, a bit solemn and full of emotions with these long cold winters, a bit complacent because I was born and raised in the house of the Carraway family, in a city where houses have been called by family names for decades.</t3514> <t3515>Now I see that in the end, the story that just happened was ultimately a story of the West. Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan, and I, we were all from the West, and perhaps we all shared some flaws that made us unable to adapt to life in the East.</t3515>
<t3516>Even when the Eastern United States fascinated me the most, even when I was about to deeply realize its superiority compared to the dull cities sprawling and expanding on the other side of the Ohio River, with endless judicial investigations leaving only children and the elderly, even then it still seemed distorted to me.</t3516> <t3517>Especially West Egg still appeared in my bizarre dreams.</t3517> <t3518>I saw it like an evening scene in a painting by the famous artist El Greco: hundreds of houses, a mix of both traditional and absurdly bizarre, hiding under a gloomy, heavy, sorrowful sky and a dim moon.</t3518> <t3519>The main foreground of the painting is four solemnly dressed men in suits walking along the sidewalk, carrying a stretcher on which lies a woman in a white evening gown, completely drunk.</t3519> <t3520>Her arm hangs loosely beside the stretcher, sparkling coldly with jewelry.</t3520> <t3521>Solemnly, the men turn into a house, a house that is not hers. Yet no one knows the name of that woman, nor do they care.</t3521>
<t3522>After Gatsby's death, the East had become haunted for me, it had been distorted and twisted</t3522>
<t3523>Even the power of my eyes could not correct it.</t3523> <t3524>So when the blue smoke from the dry leaves rose into the air and the winds blew straight through the wet clothes hanging on the line, I decided to return to my hometown.</t3524>
<t3525>There is one thing I need to do before leaving, an awkward and uncomfortable matter that I should have left alone.</t3525> <t3526>However, I want everything to be settled before I go, not trusting those eager and indifferent waves of the sea to wash away my redundant and trashy affairs.</t3526> <t3527>I went to meet Jordan Baker to talk about what had happened between us and what happened afterward to me alone.</t3527> <t3528>She sat in a large chair listening, completely motionless.</t3528>
<t3529>Jordan was dressed in golf attire, I remember thinking she looked like a beautiful illustration, her chin slightly raised in an aristocratic manner, her hair the color of autumn leaves, her rosy brown face resembling a fingerless glove resting on her knee.</t3529> <t3530>After listening to me, she didn't comment but simply stated that she was engaged to someone else.</t3530> <t3531>I doubted her words, even though I knew that many would marry her with just a nod from Jordan.</t3531> <t3532>However, I still pretended to be surprised.</t3532> <t3533>For a moment, I wondered if I had made a mistake.</t3533> <t3534>After thinking for a while, I hurriedly stood up and took my leave.</t3534>
<t3535>"Anyway, it was you who left me." Jordan suddenly said.</t3535> <t3536>"You abandoned me over the phone.</t3536> <t3537>Now I don't care about you anymore, but anyway, it was a new experience for me, it made me feel dizzy for a while."</t3537>
<t3538>We shook hands.</t3538>
<t3539>"Oh, do you still remember?"</t3539> <t3540>"Remember the conversation we had once while we were in the car," Jordan added.</t3540>
<t3541>"What?"</t3541> <t3542>"I don't remember clearly."</t3542>
<t3543>"You said that a bad driver is only safe until they meet another bad driver.</t3543> <t3544>Actually, I met another bad driver, didn't I?</t3544> <t3545>I mean, if I misunderstood that idea, then it's my mistake.</t3545> <t3546>I thought you were an honest, straightforward person.</t3546> <t3547>I suppose that is your hidden pride."</t3547>
<t3548>"I am already thirty years old.</t3548> <t3549>Five years past the age where one can deceive oneself and still call it honor." I said.</t3549>
<t3550>Jordan did not answer.</t3550> <t3551>Angry, with a lingering bit of love in my heart and feeling immensely regretful, I turned and walked away.</t3551>
<t3552>One late afternoon near the end of October, I met Tom Buchanan.</t3552> <t3553>He was walking in front of me on Fifth Avenue with his usual brisk and aggressive stride.</t3553> <t3554>Tom's arms were spread out from his body as if ready to fend off anyone who might bump into him.</t3554> <t3555>Tom's head was turning sharply from side to side to match his darting eyes.</t3555> <t3556>When I slowed down to avoid overtaking Tom, he stopped and frowned while looking into the window of a jewelry store.</t3556> <t3557>At that moment, Tom suddenly saw me, turned around, and extended his hand.</t3557>
<t3558>"What's going on, Nick?</t3558> <t3559>Don't you want to shake my hand?</t3559><t3560>?"</t3560>
<t3561>"That's right.</t3561> <t3562>You know how I feel about you."</t3562>
<t3563>"You are really crazy, Nick." Tom said quickly.</t3563> <t3564>"Terribly crazy."</t3564> <t3565>"I don't know what's wrong with you."</t3565>
<t3566>"Tom." I interrogated. "What did you tell Wilson that night?" Tom glared at me without saying a word, and I knew I had guessed correctly about what had happened during the hours Wilson was missing.</t3566> <t3567>I turned my back and walked away, but Tom followed me and grabbed my arm.</t3567>
<t3568>"I told Wilson the truth," Tom said. "He came to my door when my wife and I were about to leave the house.</t3568> <t3569>When I sent someone to tell him that we weren't home, he forced his way upstairs.</t3569> <t3570>At that moment, he was so furious that he might have killed me if I hadn't told him who owned the car.</t3570> <t3571>He had a revolver ready in his pocket every moment he was in my house." Tom loudly and defiantly challenged.</t3571> <t3572>"So what if I told Wilson?</t3572> <t3573>That guy deserved what he got.</t3573> <t3574>He had thrown dust in your eyes as well as Daisy's. But in reality, he was a cold-hearted person; he ran over Myrtle like one runs over a dog without stopping the car."</t3574>
<t3575>I couldn't open my mouth to say another word, except for a truth that I couldn't utter, which was that it was not true.</t3575>
<t3576>"Do you think I am not suffering?"</t3576> <t3577>"Listen, when I came to return the house and saw the damn box of dog food lying on the cupboard, I sat down and cried like a child. It was terrible."</t3577>
<t3578>I cannot forgive Tom or have any sympathy for him.</t3578> <t3579>I witnessed what Tom did, which to him was completely justified.</t3579> <t3580>The story was just careless and mistaken.</t3580> <t3581>Tom and Daisy are careless people; they smashed up things and people and then retreated back into their money, or into their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together.</t3581> <t3582>They let other people clean up the mess they had made.</t3582>
<t3583>I shook hands with Tom, otherwise, I would clearly be a fool, because I suddenly felt like I was talking to a child.</t3583> <t3584>Then Tom went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl bracelet, or maybe just to buy a pair of cufflinks - to forever avoid my rustic and strict nature.</t3584>
<t3585>Gatsby's mansion was still vacant when I left.</t3585> <t3586>The grass in his yard had grown as tall as the grass in mine.</t3586> <t3587>One of the village taxi drivers, whenever he drove passengers past there, would always stop at the gate for a few minutes to point inside.</t3587> <t3588>Perhaps he was the one who drove Daisy and Gatsby through East</t3588> <t3589>Egg on the night of the accident, and perhaps this driver had fabricated the story to tell his passengers.</t3589> <t3590>I did not want to hear the story and avoided him when I got off the train.</t3590>
<t3591>On Saturday nights, I always had to go sleep in New York, because the dazzling, eye-catching parties at Gatsby's house still vividly appeared in my mind, making me able to hear the indistinct sounds of music and laughter continuously from his garden, along with the bustling cars going up and down the driveway.</t3591> <t3592>One evening, I actually heard the sound of a car over there.</t3592> <t3593>I saw the car lights shining on the steps in front of Gatsby's house.</t3593> <t3594>But I did not step out to look.</t3594> <t3595>Perhaps it was from some last guest coming from the ends of the earth, not yet knowing that the festivities had ended.</t3595>
<t3596>On the last night, with the luggage packed and the car sold back to the grocery store owner, I went to gaze at the incomprehensible vast destruction of the house one more time.</t3596> <t3597>On the white stepping stones, an obscene word scrawled in chalk by some child lay glaringly clear under the moonlight.</t3597> <t3598>I rubbed my shoe on the stone to erase it.</t3598> <t3599>Then I wandered down to the sea and lay down on the sand.</t3599>
<t3600>Now, most of the large houses along the coast have closed, leaving no trace of light except for the faint, shimmering, moving light of the ferry gliding across the strait.</t3600> <t3601>As the moon rose higher, those unnecessary houses gradually faded away, allowing me to recognize that this was indeed the island of yesteryear, which once blossomed before the eyes of Dutch sailors like the fresh breasts of a newly discovered piece of the world.</t3601> <t3602>The trees that were here back then are now gone, cleared away to make room for Gatsby's house, trees that once whispered sweet temptations about the grandest dreams of mankind.</t3602> <t3603>In that mesmerizing moment of transformation, people had to hold their breath at the appearance of this continent, compelled to submit to the aesthetic image they neither understood nor desired, forced to face, for the last time, the history of what was truly worthy of their remarkable capabilities.</t3603>
<t3604>As I sat there pondering the barren world that I still did not fully understand, I thought about Gatsby's amazement when he first realized the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. Gatsby had spent so much time to reach this green lawn and his dream at that moment seemed so close, he thought he could grasp it in his hand.</t3604> <t3605>In fact, Gatsby did not know that his dream was already right behind him, somewhere in the vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.</t3605>
<t3606>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.</t3606> <t3607>It eluded us then, but that's no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning....</t3607>
<t3608>And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past</t3608>
<t3609>END</t3609>
