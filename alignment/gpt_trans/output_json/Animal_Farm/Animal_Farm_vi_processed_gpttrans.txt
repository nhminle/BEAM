<t2>Mr. Jones, the owner of the Manor Farm, closed the chicken coop, but because he was too drunk, he forgot to close the pigsty.</t2> <t3>With a hurricane lamp in hand, swaying, sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left, he staggered across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, and stepped into the kitchen to finish the last mug of beer of the day before climbing into bed, where his wife, Mrs. Jones, was already snoring.</t3>
<t4>As soon as the light in the bedroom went out, rustling and whispering sounds suddenly arose here and there.</t4> <t5>That day, there was a rumor that the Leader, a white boar who had once won a medal at an exhibition, had a strange dream the night before and wanted to share it with all the animals.</t5> <t6>They agreed that as soon as Mr. Jones went to sleep, they would gather in the big barn.</t6> <t7>All the animals on the farm respected the Leader (they called him that, although at the exhibition he was known as Willingdon Handsome) and were willing to sacrifice their sleep to hear him speak.</t7>
<t8>The Leader sat on a straw-cushioned platform at the far end of the barn, under the light of a hurricane lamp hanging from the rafters.</t8> <t9>It was twelve years old, and although it had recently gained some weight, with its protruding canine teeth, it still looked dignified and benevolent.</t9> <t10>The other animals began to arrive one by one, each finding a favorable spot to sit.</t10> <t11>First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher, followed by the pigs; they sat on the straw pile in front of the platform.</t11> <t12>The hens perched on the window sills, the pigeons settled on the rafters, and the cows and sheep lay behind the pigs and began their cud-chewing.</t12> <t13>Two cart horses named Boxer and Clover also came in, slowly approaching the platform, carefully watching each step to avoid crushing any small animals beneath the straw.</t13> <t14>Clover, a gentle middle-aged mare, had become somewhat stout after giving birth four times.</t14> <t15>Boxer, a majestic horse nearly two meters tall and as strong as two ordinary horses.</t15> <t16>Because of a white stripe down his nose, he looked somewhat stupid, and indeed he was not very intelligent, but he was respected by the other animals for his steadiness and hard work.</t16> <t17>Next came a white goat named Muriel and a donkey named Benjamin.</t17> <t18>Benjamin was the oldest animal among them, but also the most ill-tempered.</t18> <t19>Benjamin spoke little, but whenever he did, it was always to make a sarcastic remark, such as once declaring that God had given him a tail to swat flies, but he would have preferred to have neither tail nor flies.</t19> <t20>He was the only animal that never laughed.</t20> <t21>If asked why, he would say: there was nothing to laugh about.</t21> <t22>Despite this, and although he never spoke of it, he was very loyal to Boxer; every Sunday, the two of them would quietly graze together in the paddock behind the orchard.</t22>
<t23>As soon as the two horses lay down, the orphaned ducklings rushed into the barn, chirping softly as they scurried around, hoping to find a safe spot.</t23> <t24>Mrs. Fat used her front legs to create an enclosure for them, and the ducklings quickly nestled inside and fell asleep without realizing it.</t24> <t25>Just before the meeting began, Mollie, a foolish white mare who usually pulled Mr. Jones's small cart, sashayed in while chewing on a lump of sugar.</t25> <t26>She immediately took a spot in front of the platform and shook her mane, hoping the others would notice the red ribbon adorning it.</t26> <t27>Finally, there was a cat, which looked around and, as usual, sought out a warm place for itself. It squeezed in between Boxer and Mrs. Fat, purring contentedly, indifferent to whatever the Leader had to say.</t27>
<t28>So all the animals in the Manor Farm were present, except for the raven Moses, who was sleeping on the fence just outside the back door.</t28> <t29>When the Leader saw that everyone was settled and ready to listen, he cleared his throat and began:</t29>
<t30>"Comrades! As you all know, last night I had a strange dream.</t30> <t31>But I will talk about that later.</t31> <t32>First, I want to discuss with you some entirely different matters.</t32> <t33>Comrades, I think that I won't be able to stay with you much longer, so I believe that before I die, I have a responsibility to share with you the experiences I have accumulated throughout my life.</t33> <t34>I have had what can be called a long life, and I have thought a lot while lying alone in the barn. I think I can say that I understand life as well as any animal in this world.</t34> <t35>That is what I want to tell you, comrades.</t35>
<t36>Now, comrades, what is the true nature of our lives?</t36> <t37>We must look straight at the truth.</t37> <t38>Our lives are toil, misery, and short-lived.</t38> <t39>We are born, we are given just enough food to keep us from starving, those who can work must work until they are exhausted, and when we can no longer work, we are slaughtered in a most brutal and savage manner.</t39> <t40>No animal in England knows the meaning of happiness and joy from the moment they are one year old.</t40> <t41>No animal in England is free.</t41> <t42>The life of an animal is one of misery and slavery: that is the plain truth.</t42>
<t43>But is that the law of nature?</t43> <t44>Could it be that our country is so poor that it cannot support the animals living here? No, a thousand times no, comrades. Our land is fertile, the weather is favorable, and it can easily provide food for a much larger number of animals than it currently does.</t44> <t45>Just our farm alone could support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep, and all of them could live in comfort and dignity that we cannot even imagine now.</t45> <t46>So why do we continue to live in such miserable conditions?</t46> <t47>Because almost everything we produce is taken by humans.</t47> <t48>That is the cause of all our problems.</t48> <t49>In short, in one word: Man.</t49> <t50>Man is our enemy.</t50> <t51>If there were no humans, we would never be hungry again, and we would no longer have to do hard labor.</t51>
<t52>Humans are the only creatures that eat without working.</t52> <t53>Humans do not produce milk, do not lay eggs, cannot pull a plow, and do not run as fast as a rabbit.</t53> <t54>Yet they are the masters of all of us.</t54> <t55>They make us work, take away all the fruits of our labor, and only feed us enough to keep us from starving.</t55> <t56>We plow the fields, fertilize them with our dung, but what do we get?</t56> <t57>Nothing but skin and bones.</t57> <t58>Comrades cows sitting in front of me, how many liters of milk did you produce last year?</t58> <t59>And where did the milk that was supposed to nourish your calves go?</t59> <t60>Our enemy drank every last drop.</t60> <t61>And you, hens, how many eggs did you lay last year, and how many of those hatched into chicks? Old Jones and his men took them all to the market to sell for money.</t61> <t62>Mrs. Fat, where are your four children, your joy and support in your old age?</t62> <t63>They were sold when they were just a year old, and you will never see them again.</t63> <t64>A starvation diet and a shed, that's all your four labors and your farm work have earned you!</t64>
<t65>But even though we are in such a miserable state, we don't get to live our full lifespan.</t65> <t66>As for me, I have nothing to complain about, because in reality, I have been lucky.</t66> <t67>This year, I am twelve years old, and I have more than four hundred children.</t67> <t68>That's how the heavens created the pig species.</t68> <t69>But in the end, no animal can escape the cruel blade.</t69> <t70>All of you meat pigs sitting in front of me here, within a year, all of you will have to bid farewell to life on the slaughter table.</t70> <t71>All of us, cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, none of us can escape that terrible fate.</t71> <t72>The fate of horses and dogs is no better.</t72> <t73>Comrade Warrior too, as soon as your muscles weaken, old Jones will sell you to the horse butcher, who will slit your throat and boil you down for the hunting dogs to eat.</t73> <t74>The old, toothless dogs will have a brick tied to their necks by old Jones and be thrown into the lake.</t74>
<t75>Comrades, don't you see that all the suffering in our lives is caused by humans?</t75> <t76>If we eliminate humans, all the fruits of our labor will belong to us.</t76> <t77>If we achieve this, in just one night we will become rich and free.</t77> <t78>So what must we do? Work tirelessly, day and night, using both strength and talent to overthrow the human oppressors!</t78> <t79>Revolt!</t79> <t80>Comrades - that is my message.</t80> <t81>I don't know when the Revolt will happen, it could be next week, or it could be a hundred years from now, but I know for sure, as clearly as I see the straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be established.</t81> <t82>Comrades, think about this for the rest of your short lives!</t82> <t83>Moreover, pass my message to future generations, so that they may continue the struggle until the final victory.</t83>
<t84>Comrades, be steadfast.</t84> <t85>Do not waver.</t85> <t86>Do not listen to the propaganda that Man and animals have common interests, that the prosperity of one is the prosperity of the other.</t86> <t87>It's all deceit.</t87> <t88>Man does not care about anyone's interests; he only cares about himself.</t88> <t89>We animals must unite and have a spirit of comradeship in this struggle.</t89> <t90>All humans are enemies.</t90> <t91>All animals are comrades.</t91>
<t92>At that moment, a commotion arose.</t92> <t93>It turned out that while the Leader was speaking, four sewer rats had crawled out of their hole and also came to listen.</t93> <t94>The dogs saw them, and luckily the rats managed to run back into their hole, otherwise they would have lost their lives.</t94> <t95>The Leader had to raise his paw to request silence.</t95>
<t96>"Comrades," it said, "there is a problem that needs to be addressed.</t96> <t97>Wild animals like rats and rabbits, are they our friends or our enemies? Let's put it to a vote.</t97> <t98>I would like to pose the question to the assembly as follows: Are rats comrades?"</t98>
<t99>The vote was conducted immediately, with the majority agreeing to consider the rats as comrades. There were only four votes against, which came from three dogs and one cat, but it was later discovered that the cat had cast both a for and against vote.</t99> <t100>The Leader continued:</t100>
<t101>"I would like to add a little more.</t101> <t102>I just want to reiterate that your duty is to always fight against Man and everything created by him.</t102> <t103>All two-legged creatures are enemies.</t103> <t104>All four-legged creatures or those with wings are friends.</t104> <t105>Comrades, you must always remember that we must not imitate humans in our struggle against them.</t105> <t106>Even when victorious, we must not adopt their vices.</t106> <t107>No animal must live in a house, sleep in a bed, wear clothes, drink alcohol, smoke, use money, or engage in trade.</t107> <t108>All human customs are harmful.</t108> <t109>Most importantly, no animal must oppress another.</t109> <t110>Strong or weak, intelligent or ordinary, we are all brothers.</t110> <t111>We must not kill one another.</t111> <t112>All animals are born equal.</t112>
<t113>And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream from last night.</t113> <t114>I cannot describe it.</t114> <t115>I dreamed of the Earth when humans had already disappeared.</t115> <t116>This dream revived in my mind the following event:</t116>
<t117>"A long time ago, when I was still a little pig, my mother along with other pigs used to sing a song from the old days: they only remembered the melody and the first three words.</t117> <t118>When I was young, I also knew the melody, but I had forgotten it long ago.</t118> <t119>However, last night, in a dream, I remembered everything, and more than that, I also recalled the lyrics of the song. I am certain that in the past, animals used to sing it, but later they forgot, and in recent generations, they completely lost the ability to sing.</t119> <t120>Now I will sing it for you comrades.</t120> <t121>I am old, my voice is no longer clear, but when I teach you the melody, you will sing it better.</t121> <t122>The song is called: Beasts of England."</t122>
<t123>The old leader cleared his throat and began to sing.</t123> <t124>His voice was indeed hoarse, but he didn't sing too badly, with a melody that was a mix between "Clementine" and "La Cucuracha".</t124> <t125>The lyrics went like this:</t125>
<t126>"Animal of the United Kingdom"</t126>
<t127>Animals everywhere</t127>
<t128>Listening to new joys</t128>
<t129>Of a bright tomorrow</t129>
<t130>Mountainous grasslands</t130>
<t131>Forever bright green</t131>
<t132>When the people</t132>
<t133>No longer a burden on the shoulders</t133>
<t134>Branches, branches are no more</t134>
<t135>Firmness, not even firm</t135>
<t136>Beating, scolding</t136>
<t137>It's just a dark past</t137>
<t138>I am rich, I have</t138>
<t139>Orchards, rice fields</t139>
<t140>Beans, cassava, corn, sweet potatoes</t140>
<t141>It's ours from here</t141>
<t142>The sun shines brightly</t142>
<t143>The water is increasingly fresh and sweet</t143>
<t144>The cool breeze of eternity</t144>
<t145>It is the day of future freedom</t145>
<t146>Animal Farm</t146>
<t147>Animals everywhere</t147>
<t148>Listen to the new joy</t148>
<t149>Of a bright tomorrow</t149>
<t150>The song had made the animals extremely excited.</t150> <t151>Some of them managed to join in even before the Leader finished singing.</t151> <t152>Even the most ignorant ones grasped the melody and learned a few words, while the smarter ones, like the dogs and pigs, memorized the entire song within the first few minutes.</t152> <t153>After a few practice sessions, the whole farm could sing the "Beasts of England" in unison.</t153> <t154>Each species sang in its own voice: cows bellowed, dogs barked, sheep bleated, horses neighed, and ducks quacked.</t154> <t155>They enjoyed the song so much that they sang it five times in a row and could have kept singing it all night if they hadn't been interrupted.</t155>
<t156>Unfortunately, the loud noise woke Mr. Jones, who got out of bed convinced that a fox had entered the yard.</t156> <t157>He grabbed the gun that was always kept in the corner of the room and fired a series of shots into the air.</t157> <t158>Some pellets embedded themselves in the wall of the barn, and the meeting quickly came to an end.</t158> <t159>Each animal returned to its sleeping place.</t159> <t160>The poultry jumped onto their perches, while the livestock lay down on the straw, and soon the entire farm was asleep.</t160>
<t161>Chapter 2</t161>
<t162>Three nights later, the old Leader peacefully passed away.</t162> <t163>His body was buried at the end of the garden.</t163>
<t164>That incident happened at the beginning of March.</t164> <t165>The animals intensified their underground activities continuously for the next three months.</t165> <t166>The Leader's speech had created an entirely new way of life for the intelligent ones.</t166> <t167>They didn't know when the Rebellion that the Leader predicted would happen, nor did they think they would witness it, but they knew one thing clearly: they had the responsibility to carry out the preparations.</t167> <t168>Of course, the task of education and organization was assigned to the pigs because they were considered the most intelligent species.</t168> <t169>Two young male pigs named Snowball and Napoleon, who were being fattened by Mr. Jones for sale, were the most famous.</t169> <t170>Napoleon was a fierce-looking boar, the only Berkshire on the Manor Farm; he was known for being taciturn but reputedly patient.</t170> <t171>Snowball was more lively, more articulate, and had more ideas, but most believed his character was not as deep as Napoleon's.</t171> <t172>The rest were all meat pigs.</t172> <t173>The most prominent among them was named Squealer, a small, rather fat but nimble pig with chubby cheeks, darting eyes, and a shrill voice.</t173> <t174>He was an excellent speaker; when he needed to prove a difficult point, he would skip around and wag his tail, looking very persuasive.</t174> <t175>It was rumored that he could turn black into white with ease.</t175>
<t176>These three had developed the old Leader's doctrine into a complete philosophical system which they called Animalism. Every night, after Mr. Jones went to bed, they would secretly gather in the barn to explain the main principles of Animalism to the other animals. At first, it was quite difficult because the animals were indifferent and very ignorant.</t176> <t177>Some said they had a duty of loyalty to Mr. Jones, whom they called their master, and some even naively remarked, "Mr. Jones feeds us.</t177> <t178>Without him, we would starve to death."</t178> <t179>Some even asked questions like, "Why should we care about what happens after we die?" or "The rebellion is going to happen anyway, whether we do anything or not."</t179> <t180>The pigs had a hard time convincing them that such arguments were completely contrary to the spirit of Animalism. But the most foolish questions came from a white mare named Mollie.</t180> <t181>First, she asked Snowball:</t181>
<t182>"So, after the uprising, is there a way?"</t182>
<t183>"No," Tuyết Tròn interrupted, "We do not produce sugar."</t183> <t184>In fact, comrade, you will not need sugar.</t184> <t185>You will have enough oats and straw that you need."</t185>
<t186>"So, can I still wear the ribbon?"</t186>
<t187>"Comrade," Tuyết Tròn said, "The ribbon that you love so much is actually a symbol of the spirit of slavery."</t187> <t188>"Don't you see that freedom is more precious than the ribbon?"</t188>
<t189>Mollie agreed, but she didn't seem very trusting.</t189>
<t190>The pigs had an even harder time refuting the arguments put forth by the raven Moses.</t190> <t191>Moses was Mr. Jones's pet, he specialized in sneaking around but remembered many fairy tales and was also a skilled orator.</t191> <t192>He claimed to know of a mythical kingdom called Sugarcandy Mountain, where the souls of animals would go after they died.</t192> <t193>Moses said that this place was not far away, just beyond the clouds.</t193> <t194>There, all seven days of the week were Sundays, the clover was green all year round, and rock candy and dry bread grew right on the hedges.</t194> <t195>The animals hated Moses because he only talked and did no work, but some of them believed in his Sugarcandy Mountain, so the pigs had to work very hard to convince them that no such place existed.</t195>
<t196>The most trusted apostles of theirs were the two cart horses, Boxer and Clover. These two were originally slow to understand, but once they regarded the pigs as their masters, they absorbed every teaching and then explained it to the others in a more comprehensible language.</t196> <t197>These two never missed a single meeting and were often the ones leading the singing of "Beasts of England" at the end of each meeting.</t197>
<t198>The Uprising happened much earlier and more easily than they had anticipated.</t198> <t199>In recent years, Mr. Jones, who had been a good and strict landlord, encountered many troubles.</t199> <t200>After losing a lot of money in lawsuits, he became gloomy and drank more than usual.</t200> <t201>He often sat all day in the kitchen armchair, reading the newspaper and drinking beer, occasionally giving Moses some beer-soaked bread crumbs.</t201> <t202>The servants became a bunch of lazy thieves, the fields turned into wastelands, the houses were dilapidated, the fences were leaning and collapsing, and the animals were frequently left starving.</t202>
<t203>June has come, this is the season for cutting grass.</t203> <t204>Before the Summer Solstice, that day was a Saturday, Mr. Jones went to Willingdon and got drunk at the Red Lion tavern, returning only by noon on Sunday.</t204> <t205>The farmhands hurriedly milked the cows early in the morning and then went rabbit hunting without bothering to feed the animals at all.</t205> <t206>Upon returning home, Mr. Jones immediately climbed onto the sofa in the living room, covered his face with a copy of "News of the World," and fell asleep, leaving the animals unfed until late evening.</t206> <t207>Finally, they couldn't stand it any longer.</t207> <t208>A cow broke down the door of the storage shed, and all the animals rushed to the grain bins.</t208> <t209>At that moment, Mr. Jones woke up.</t209> <t210>He and the four farmhands immediately grabbed whips and rushed into the shed, relentlessly lashing the poor animals.</t210> <t211>The starving animals could no longer endure it.</t211> <t212>Without any prior agreement, they charged forward and attacked their oppressors.</t212> <t213>Mr. Jones and the farmhands were suddenly kicked and butted from all directions.</t213> <t214>The situation became uncontrollable.</t214> <t215>They had never encountered anything like this before; the sudden rebellion of the animals, which they had previously beaten and mistreated at will, threw them into a panic.</t215> <t216>They could only hold out for a few minutes before having to flee.</t216> <t217>All five of them hurriedly rushed down the small path to the village road, while the animals enthusiastically chased after them.</t217>
<t218>Through the bedroom window, Mrs. Jones had seen everything; she hurriedly put a few things into a cloth bag and slipped out the back door to escape the Manor Farm.</t218> <t219>Moses also managed to fly out of his nest, cawing and following his mistress.</t219> <t220>After successfully chasing away the intruders, the animals returned and closed the gate.</t220> <t221>Thus, the Rebellion was completely victorious, Mr. Jones was driven away, and the Manor Farm belonged to the animals before they even had time to understand everything.</t221>
<t222>At first, they did not believe that fate had smiled upon them.</t222> <t223>Their first action was to gather together and run around the compound to see if anyone was left inside, then they rushed into the buildings to destroy the remnants of Mr. Jones's dictatorial regime.</t223> <t224>The tool shed at the end of the stable was smashed, and all the horse bits, cattle nose rings, dog chains, and castration knives for pigs and sheep were thrown down the well.</t224> <t225>As for the reins, nooses, horse blinders, and old feed baskets usually hung around the horses' necks, they were thrown into the fire in the middle of the yard.</t225> <t226>The whips met the same fate.</t226> <t227>All the animals jumped up and down when they saw the whips catch fire.</t227> <t228>Snowball even threw the ribbons that were usually tied to the horses' manes and tails during fairs into the fire.</t228>
<t229>"Ribbons," it declared, "must be considered clothing, as well as a symbol of humanity."</t229> <t230>"All animals must be naked."</t230>
<t231>Hearing that, the Warrior hurriedly took off the straw hat that it usually wore in the summer to prevent flies from getting into its ears and threw it into the fire.</t231>
<t232>It wasn't long before the animals had destroyed everything related to Mr. Jones.</t232> <t233>Napoleon led the group into the storehouse and doubled the daily rations, giving each dog two butter biscuits.</t233> <t234>After that, they sang "Beasts of England" seven times in a row, then everyone went to sleep, never having slept as well as they did that night.</t234>
<t235>As usual, they woke up just as dawn was breaking, but they immediately remembered the glorious event that had just happened, and so they all rushed out to the meadow.</t235> <t236>On the meadow, there was a small hill, from which most of the farm could be seen.</t236> <t237>The animals ran up there and gazed at the scene in the rosy light of a new day.</t237> <t238>Everything, everything before their eyes now belonged to them!</t238> <t239>In a state of euphoria, they kept running around, running around endlessly, occasionally jumping up in joy!</t239> <t240>They rolled on the wet dew, filled their mouths with sweet summer grass, tossed up clumps of black soil, and inhaled its warm, rich scent.</t240> <t241>Then they went to inspect the entire farm, silently observing the fields of grain, the meadows, the orchard, the fish pond, and the grove.</t241> <t242>They looked at them as if they had never seen them before, and even now they could not believe that all those things were theirs.</t242>
<t243>Then the whole group returned together and quietly gathered in front of the main house.</t243><t244>Although this house now belonged to them, they were still hesitant and did not dare to enter immediately.</t244><t245>But Snowball and Napoleon quickly regained their composure and used their shoulders to break open the door, then each one cautiously stepped inside, careful not to disturb the items within.</t245><t246>They tiptoed from room to room, whispering, nervously admiring the unbelievable luxury before their eyes: feather beds, mirrors, horsehair-stuffed chairs, velvet carpets, and a portrait of Queen Victoria hanging above the fireplace in the living room.</t246><t247>But when they reached the bottom of the stairs, they suddenly realized that Mollie was missing.</t247><t248>They turned back and found Mollie still standing in the most beautiful bedroom in the house.</t248><t249>It turned out she had taken a blue ribbon from Mrs. Jones's dressing table, draped it over her shoulder, and was gazing at herself in the mirror.</t249><t250>The others immediately grabbed her and dragged her out of the house.</t250><t251>The hams hanging in the kitchen were buried, the beer barrel in the scullery was kicked open by Boxer, and almost everything else was left in its place.</t251><t252>A resolution to keep the main house as a museum was unanimously passed on the spot.</t252><t253>All agreed that no animal should ever live in this house.</t253>
<t254>They went to have breakfast and then Snowball and Napoleon invited everyone to gather.</t254>
<t255>"Comrades," Tuyết Tròn said, "It is now seven-thirty, we still have the whole day ahead of us.</t255> <t256>Today we will start cutting grass, but we have one task to do first."</t256>
<t257>So the two pigs said that thanks to the elementary books Mr. Jones found in the trash, they had been studying for the past three months and now they could read and write.</t257> <t258>Napoleon ordered to fetch a can of red paint, a can of white paint, and then led the group to the main gate.</t258> <t259>Snowball (because he had the best handwriting) held the paintbrush between his two hooves, erased the words Manor Farm, and wrote Animal Farm on the top plank of the gate.</t259> <t260>From now on, that would be the official name of the farm.</t260> <t261>After that, the group returned to the house, and Snowball and Napoleon ordered to find a ladder and set it up against the end wall of the barn.</t261> <t262>They explained that after a period of diligent research, in the past three months, they had distilled the principles of Animalism into Seven Commandments.</t262> <t263>The Seven Commandments would be inscribed on the wall and would be the unalterable law for all members of Animal Farm.</t263> <t264>Snowball climbed the ladder with difficulty (because pigs have trouble balancing on ladders) and began to write, while Squealer held the paint can below a few rungs.</t264> <t265>The commandments were written in white paint on the tarred wall, clearly readable from thirty meters away.</t265> <t266>The content was as follows:</t266>
<t267>THE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS</t267>
<t268>All two-legged creatures are enemies.</t268>
<t269>All four-legged creatures or those with wings are friends.</t269>
<t270>No animal shall wear clothes.</t270>
<t271>No animal shall sleep in a bed.</t271>
<t272>No animal shall drink alcohol.</t272>
<t273>Animals must not kill each other.</t273>
<t274>All animals are born equal.</t274>
<t275>All the letters were written clearly and the entire passage had only two spelling mistakes: the word "giường" was written as "gưìơng" and one letter S was written backwards.</t275> <t276>Tuyết Tròn read it aloud for everyone to hear.</t276> <t277>Everyone nodded in agreement, and the smarter ones immediately memorized the Commandments.</t277>
<t278>"Now, comrades," Tuyết Tròn shouted as she threw the paintbrush to the ground, "everyone to the fields to cut grass!</t278> <t279>We must harvest faster than old Jones and his servants.</t279>
<t280>At that moment, the three cows, who had been feeling uncomfortable for some time, suddenly bellowed.</t280> <t281>For the past twenty-four hours, they had not been milked, and their udders were so full they seemed about to burst.</t281> <t282>After a moment of hesitation, the pigs ordered buckets to be brought and performed the task quite skillfully, their legs proving suitable for the job.</t282> <t283>Before long, they had filled five buckets with rich milk, and some curious animals came to watch.</t283>
<t284>"What should we do with this milk?" the child asked.</t284>
<t285>"Old Jones occasionally mixes milk into our food," a hen spoke up.</t285>
<t286>"Comrades, why bother about the milk!" Napoleon shouted as he stepped in front of the milk pails, "Leave it for now and we'll deal with it later.</t286> <t287>The harvest is more important. Comrade Snowball will lead the way.</t287> <t288>I will follow shortly.</t288> <t289>Comrades, move forward! The harvest needs us.</t289>
<t290>The animals went out to the field and started cutting grass, but by the afternoon they couldn't find the buckets of milk anymore.</t290>

<t293>Chapter 3</t293>
<t294>It must be acknowledged that they work very diligently, regardless of fatigue, just to finish the harvest!</t294> <t295>Their hard work has been rewarded, they have harvested more than expected.</t295>
<t296>Sometimes they also encountered some difficulties because all the tools were made for humans, not for animals, and to use those tools, one had to stand on two hind legs.</t296> <t297>But it must be said that pigs are an intelligent breed - no matter how difficult, they always find a way.</t297> <t298>As for the horses, they understood each plot of land well, and they were much better at cutting and piling grass than Mr. Jones and his men.</t298> <t299>The pigs did not work but only guided and supervised the others.</t299> <t300>With such knowledge, it was natural for them to take on the leadership role.</t300> <t301>Boxer and Clover harnessed themselves to the cutter or the harrow (of course, without needing bits or reins) and patiently walked around the fields, while a pig followed behind, occasionally shouting "Straight ahead, comrade!" or "Turn back, comrade!".</t301> <t302>All the animals, regardless of size, participated in cutting and stacking the grass.</t302> <t303>Even the chickens and ducks exposed themselves to the sun all day to help transport small bundles of grass with their beaks.</t303> <t304>They completed the work quickly, faster than humans, as it would have taken Mr. Jones and his men two more days to finish.</t304> <t305>Moreover, it was the most productive harvest ever.</t305> <t306>There was no wastage because the chickens and ducks, with their keen eyes, picked up every single blade.</t306> <t307>And no animal stole even a single bite.</t307>
<t308>The farm work went smoothly throughout that summer.</t308> <t309>The animals felt extremely happy; they had never thought that such a thing could happen.</t309> <t310>Eating was a joy, because now the food was theirs, made by them and for them, not something begrudgingly given by a stingy master anymore.</t310> <t311>After they had driven away the useless parasitic humans, each animal's portion naturally increased.</t311> <t312>And although they lacked experience, they still had more leisure time.</t312> <t313>They did encounter some difficulties, for example, when harvesting grain they had to use their strength to blow away the chaff because the farm didn't have a threshing machine, but with the intelligence of the pigs and the strength of Boxer, there was nothing they couldn't accomplish.</t313> <t314>Boxer was highly respected.</t314> <t315>Even when Mr. Jones was still around, he was already diligent, but now he worked three times as hard, sometimes it seemed like the entire farm's work fell on his shoulders.</t315> <t316>He pulled and pushed from dawn till dusk and was always present at the most difficult spots.</t316> <t317>He asked a rooster to wake him up half an hour earlier and voluntarily did some of the most urgent tasks before the official workday began.</t317> <t318>In the face of any difficulty or obstacle, he would say, "I will work harder!" This phrase had become his personal motto.</t318>
<t319>The other animals also worked with all their might.</t319> <t320>For example, the chickens and ducks managed to gather up to two quintals of grain.</t320> <t321>Petty theft; complaints about food and drink; quarrels and fights; jealousy - those bad habits of the past had completely disappeared.</t321> <t322>No animal shirked work - or rather, almost no animal.</t322> <t323>Mollie didn't like getting up early and tried to slip away, claiming that a small stone had gotten into her hoof.</t323> <t324>The cat's attitude was also suspicious.</t324> <t325>Whenever needed, it invariably disappeared beforehand.</t325> <t326>She often went off somewhere for a long time and only appeared, as if nothing had happened, right before meals or in the afternoon when the work was done.</t326> <t327>But she always found a way to explain and purred so charmingly that it was hard to doubt her goodwill.</t327> <t328>Only the old donkey Benjamin remained the same.</t328> <t329>He still did his work with the same slow pace as in Mr. Jones's time, never shirking but never doing more either.</t329> <t330>He said nothing about the Rebellion or the changes that followed.</t330> <t331>If asked whether he felt happier than in Mr. Jones's time, he would say: "Donkey's life is long.</t331> <t332>You have never seen a dead donkey" - he always said such a cryptic sentence.</t332>
<t333>Sunday is a day off.</t333> <t334>Breakfast is an hour later, and after that, there is always a solemn gathering.</t334> <t335>First is the flag-raising ceremony.</t335> <t336>Snowball found an old green tablecloth of Mrs. Jones in the tool shed and drew a hoof and a horn in white on it.</t336> <t337>And so, every Sunday morning, the tablecloth would flutter on the flagpole in the garden.</t337> <t338>Snowball explained that the green color symbolized the fields of England, while the hoof and horn were symbols of the future Animal Republic, once the humans were completely overthrown.</t338> <t339>After the flag-raising, all the animals would gather in the big barn, which they called the Meeting.</t339> <t340>They would plan the coming week and discuss and pass resolutions on various proposals there.</t340> <t341>Only the pigs made proposals.</t341> <t342>The other animals only voted but never proposed anything.</t342> <t343>Snowball and Napoleon were the most active in discussions.</t343> <t344>But these two always opposed each other: whenever one proposed an idea, the other would immediately counter it.</t344> <t345>Even when a matter had been decided, such as setting aside a small piece of land behind the orchard for retirement, which no one could oppose, these two would still argue fiercely over which species and at what age they should retire.</t345> <t346>The Meetings always ended with the singing of "Beasts of England," and in the afternoon, they were free to rest.</t346>
<t347>The pigs used the old harness-room as their headquarters.</t347> <t348>In the evenings, they studied carpentry, blacksmithing, and other trades through books they found in the main house.</t348> <t349>Snowball also organized the other animals into what he called Animal Committees. He worked on this enthusiastically, never tiring.</t349> <t350>He had established the Egg Production Committee for the hens, the Clean Tails League for the cows, the Wild Comrades' Re-education Committee (the aim of which was to tame the rats and rabbits); the Whiter Wool Movement for the sheep, and so on, not to mention the literacy classes.</t350> <t351>In general, Snowball's projects were not very successful.</t351> <t352>The attempt to tame the wild creatures failed almost immediately.</t352> <t353>Their behavior did not change at all, and if anything, they became even more unruly.</t353> <t354>The cat was also a member of the Re-education Committee and was very active for a few days.</t354> <t355>Once, it even climbed onto the roof to talk to some sparrows that were out of its reach.</t355> <t356>It told them that now all animals were comrades and that any sparrow who wished could perch on its paw; but the sparrows kept their distance.</t356>
<t357>The reading and writing classes achieved positive results.</t357> <t358>Before autumn arrived, most of the animals on the farm had escaped illiteracy to a certain extent.</t358>
<t359>The pigs could read and write fluently.</t359> <t360>The dogs could also read, but they only read the Seven Commandments.</t360> <t361>The goat named Muriel could read better than the dogs, so in the evenings, she would often read to the others from scraps of newspaper she found in the trash heap.</t361> <t362>The donkey Benjamin could read as quickly as the pigs, but he never read anything.</t362> <t363>He said there was nothing worth reading.</t363> <t364>Mrs. Fatty memorized the entire alphabet but couldn't spell words.</t364> <t365>Warrior couldn't get past the letter D.</t365> <t366>He would often use his large hooves to write the letters A, B, C, D in the sand and then stand back to look at them, ears folded back, occasionally flicking his mane, trying to remember what came next, but he never could.</t366> <t367>Sometimes he would manage to remember the letters E, F, G, H, but it was always the same: if he remembered those letters, he would forget A, B, C, D. In the end, he settled for those four letters and practiced writing them once or twice a day to train his memory.</t367> <t368>Mollie only learned the five letters that spelled her name.</t368> <t369>She would often use a small twig to arrange those letters and then decorate them with a few flowers, after which she would walk around to admire them.</t369>
<t370>The others did not get past the letter A.</t370> <t371>Less intelligent species like sheep, chickens, and ducks could not memorize the Seven Commandments. After some thought, Snowball declared that the Seven Commandments could be reduced to a single maxim: "Four legs good, two legs bad."</t371> <t372>He said that this was the fundamental principle of Animalism. As long as they grasped this maxim, they would no longer fear the influence of humans.</t372> <t373>The chickens and ducks protested, arguing that they only had two legs, but Snowball proved that this was not the case.</t373>
<t374>"The wings, comrades," Tuyết Tròn said, "are organs for movement, not for grasping.</t374> <t375>Wings are just like legs.</t375> <t376>The distinguishing feature from Humans is the hands; all the evil deeds are done by their hands."</t376>
<t377>The chickens and ducks did not fully understand the lengthy sermon, but they agreed with Snowball's explanation, and all the more foolish animals had to memorize the new maxim. FOUR LEGS GOOD, TWO LEGS BAD was written larger, above the Seven Commandments. Once they had memorized it, the sheep showed great enthusiasm for this maxim, and whenever they were resting, they would chant in unison, "Four legs good, two legs bad! Four legs good, two legs bad!" tirelessly for hours on end.</t377>
<t378>Napoleon did not care about Snowball's committees.</t378> <t379>He said that educating the younger generation was more important than mobilizing the already grown animals.</t379> <t380>The two female dogs, Jessie and Bluebell, gave birth to nine healthy puppies right after the harvest.</t380> <t381>Napoleon took the puppies as soon as they were weaned, saying he would take responsibility for their education.</t381> <t382>He hid the puppies in the attic, above the tool shed, which could only be reached by ladder, and kept them there so secretly that gradually no one remembered the puppies anymore.</t382>
<t383>The issue of milk loss is no longer a secret.</t383> <t384>The pigs mixed it into the daily feed.</t384> <t385>The early-season apples have ripened, and every day some fall onto the grass in the garden.</t385> <t386>All the animals thought they would be shared equally, but one day there was an order to collect the fallen apples and store them in the tool shed exclusively for the pigs.</t386> <t387>Some animals complained about this, but it led nowhere.</t387> <t388>On this matter, the pigs, including Snowball and Napoleon, were in complete agreement.</t388> <t389>Squealer was assigned to carry out the propaganda work.</t389>
<t390>"Comrades," it said, "I hope you don't think that we pigs are doing this out of selfishness and privilege, do you? Many pig comrades are also sick of milk and apples.</t390> <t391>I don't like those two things either.</t391> <t392>Our purpose in eating those things is solely to protect our health.</t392> <t393>Milk and apples (Comrades, science has proven) contain many substances that are extremely necessary for the health of pigs.</t393> <t394>We pigs do intellectual work.</t394> <t395>We handle all the organization and management of this farm.</t395> <t396>For your prosperity, we have to work day and night.</t396> <t397>We drink milk and eat apples for your own benefit.</t397> <t398>Can you imagine what would happen if we pigs couldn't handle our duties? Mr. Jones would come back! Yes, Mr. Jones would come back!</t398> <t399>Surely none of us want Mr. Jones to come back, do we?" it pleaded loudly, shouting and jumping from right to left, its tail wagging furiously, "Surely none of us want Mr. Jones to come back, right?"</t399>
<t400>Surely no animal wanted Mr. Jones to come back.</t400><t401>When put that way, no animal dared to speak up anymore.</t401><t402>The health of the pigs was of utmost importance, that was unquestionable.</t402><t403>So they unanimously agreed without further discussion that the milk and fallen apples (when in season, all of them) were to be reserved exclusively for the pigs.</t403>

<t405>Animal Farm</t405>
<t406>Chapter 4</t406>
<t407>By the end of summer, news about Animal Farm had spread across half the country.</t407> <t408>Every day, Snowball and Napoleon sent flocks of pigeons to infiltrate other farms to propagate the Rebellion and teach the song "Beasts of England."</t408>
<t409>Meanwhile, Mr. Jones almost every day sat in the Red Lion restaurant in Willingdon, lamenting to anyone who would listen about being robbed of his property by the useless animals.</t409> <t410>The other farm owners were sympathetic, but they didn't offer any help.</t410> <t411>Moreover, deep down, they were looking for ways to take advantage of his misfortune.</t411> <t412>Fortunately, the owners of the two farms adjacent to Animal Farm were always at odds with each other.</t412> <t413>One farm was called Foxwood, a large but neglected farm, cultivated in the old-fashioned way, with overgrown areas, trampled grazing grounds, and dilapidated fences.</t413> <t414>The owner of this farm, Mr. Pilkington, was an easygoing man who spent most of his time hunting and fishing.</t414> <t415>The second farm was called Pinchfield, smaller but better maintained.</t415> <t416>The owner of this farm, Mr. Frederick, was a tough, shrewd man, constantly involved in lawsuits and notorious as a cunning swindler.</t416> <t417>These two men hated each other so much that they couldn't find common ground even in protecting their own interests.</t417>
<t418>But the Rebellion at Animal Farm had frightened both of them, and they tried everything to prevent the news from reaching their own farms.</t418> <t419>At first, they pretended to ridicule the idea of animals running a farm by themselves.</t419> <t420>"It won't last more than a fortnight," they said.</t420> <t421>They spread rumors that the animals at Manor Farm (they insisted on calling it Manor Farm and refused to acknowledge the name Animal Farm) were constantly fighting among themselves and would soon starve to death.</t421> <t422>After some time, seeing that the animals were not starving, Frederick and Pilkington changed their tune and began talking about unimaginable immoral scenes taking place at Animal Farm.</t422> <t423>They claimed that the animals were eating each other, torturing each other with red-hot horseshoes, and that the females had become communal property.</t423> <t424>"That's what happens when you go against the laws of Nature," Frederick and Pilkington said.</t424>
<t425>But not many people believed that story.</t425> <t426>The rumor about a strange farm, where humans were driven away and the animals managed the work themselves, continued to be passed around in a vague and distorted manner, and throughout that year, waves of unrest spread across the countryside.</t426> <t427>Oxen that were usually docile suddenly became aggressive, sheep broke down fences and trampled the pastures, cows knocked over milk pails, and racehorses refused to jump over fences, throwing their riders high into the air.</t427> <t428>The melody and lyrics of the song "Beasts of England" spread to every nook and cranny.</t428> <t429>It was disseminated at an unprecedented speed.</t429> <t430>The song drove people mad, but they pretended it was just a ridiculous joke.</t430> <t431>Even animals couldn't possibly sing such vile rubbish, they said.</t431> <t432>Any animal caught singing that song was immediately beaten on the spot.</t432> <t433>Yet it still couldn't be completely banned.</t433> <t434>Birds sang it on the fences, pigeons cooed it in the trees, the song entered the chirping of crickets, and even the church bells.</t434> <t435>Humans shivered every time they heard it, as if they were hearing a forewarning of their own doom.</t435>
<t436>At the beginning of October, after harvesting and storing all the grain, with some already threshed, a flock of pigeons suddenly tore through the air and landed in the farmyard, looking extremely agitated.</t436> <t437>Mr. Jones, along with his servants and about half a dozen young men from Foxwood and Pinchfield farms, had passed through the main gate and were advancing into the farm.</t437> <t438>Mr. Jones was brandishing a loaded gun, while the others were armed with sticks.</t438> <t439>There was no doubt about it, they intended to recapture the farm.</t439>
<t440>But the animals were not caught off guard; on the contrary, they had been preparing for this event for a long time.</t440> <t441>Snowball, who had previously studied the book on Julius Caesar's campaigns [2] thoroughly, which it found in the main house, was assigned to organize the defense.</t441> <t442>It immediately issued orders, and the animals quickly took up their assigned positions.</t442>
<t443>Tuyet Tron ordered an attack as soon as the group of people approached the row of houses in the farm.</t443> <t444>Thirty-five pigeons were dispatched, flying back and forth and defecating on the heads of the people below. While they were busy dodging and brushing off, the geese, ambushed behind the fence, rushed out and bit their legs.</t444> <t445>But that was just a tactical move to disrupt the enemy's ranks because it was easy for people to use sticks to drive the geese away.</t445> <t446>The second wave of attack was launched.</t446> <t447>Muriel, Benjamin, and the entire flock of sheep, led by Tuyet Tron himself, charged forward, surrounding the people and butting them while Benjamin turned his back on them and kicked wildly.</t447> <t448>But this time, the animals did not win either; the sticks and spiked shoes used by the humans were too strong for them.</t448> <t449>Seeing the unfavorable situation, Tuyet Tron neighed loudly, which was the signal to temporarily retreat, and the animals quickly fled into the yard.</t449>
<t450>The victorious cheers echoed.</t450> <t451>The attackers saw that the enemy had fled as expected, so without needing to reorganize their ranks, they hurriedly rushed forward to pursue.</t451> <t452>Just as Snowball had anticipated.</t452> <t453>When everyone had entered the yard, three horses, three cows, and all the remaining pigs that had been lying in ambush in the cow shed rushed out to cut off the retreat.</t453> <t454>Snowball ordered a full assault.</t454> <t455>He charged straight at Mr. Jones.</t455> <t456>Mr. Jones saw him coming and pulled the trigger.</t456> <t457>The shotgun blast wounded Snowball along his back, blood streaming out, and killed a sheep.</t457> <t458>Without hesitating for a second, Snowball continued to thrust his hefty body into Mr. Jones's legs.</t458> <t459>He fell sprawling into a pile of dung, his gun flying far away.</t459> <t460>But the most terrifying was Boxer, who stood on his hind legs and brought down his iron-shod hooves on the man's head.</t460> <t461>His first blow knocked the Foxwood farmhand to the ground, unconscious.</t461> <t462>Several people threw down their sticks and fled.</t462> <t463>Not missing the opportunity, the animals chased them around the yard.</t463> <t464>They butted them up, then bit, kicked, and trampled.</t464> <t465>There wasn't a single animal on the farm that didn't take part in the revenge in its own way.</t465> <t466>Even the cat leapt from the roof of the cow shed onto a cowherd's shoulders, biting his neck and screeching as if in a fit.</t466> <t467>As soon as they saw an opening to retreat, everyone hurriedly ran out of the yard to the main road.</t467> <t468>Thus, having penetrated for less than five minutes, they had to flee, with the geese biting their legs and honking as they chased them.</t468>
<t469>There was one person who did not escape.</t469> <t470>In the yard, the Soldier was trying to turn over the stable cleaner who was still lying face down in the mud.</t470> <t471>The man did not move at all.</t471>
<t472>"He's dead!", the Warrior exclaimed sadly, "I didn't mean to do that.</t472> <t473>I forgot that I was wearing iron claws.</t473> <t474>Who would believe now that I didn't do it on purpose?"</t474>
<t475>"Stop being sentimental, comrade!" Tuyết Tròn said, blood still oozing from his back at times, "War is war.</t475> <t476>Good people are those who have died."</t476>
<t477>"I did not mean to kill, not even to kill a person," the Warrior kept repeating, eyes filled with tears.</t477>
<t478>"Where's Mollie?", someone asked.</t478>
<t479>Indeed, Mollie was nowhere to be seen.</t479> <t480>At first, they were very worried, fearing that Mollie might have been injured or captured by the humans.</t480> <t481>Eventually, she was found hiding in the horse stable, her head buried in a pile of straw.</t481> <t482>She had fled as soon as she heard the gunshots.</t482> <t483>While the animals were searching for Mollie, the stable boy regained consciousness and escaped.</t483>
<t484>The animals had gathered in full, they were extremely excited, and competed to speak.</t484> <t485>The victory celebration was organized immediately.</t485> <t486>The flag was raised and they sang "Beasts of England" several times, then they held a funeral for the fallen sheep and planted a hawthorn bush on its grave.</t486> <t487>Snowball gave a speech right next to the fallen warrior's grave, emphasizing that every animal must be ready to sacrifice for Animal Farm when needed.</t487>
<t488>The animals unanimously decided to establish a reward for the recent feats, which was the title of First Class Animal Hero. This title was immediately awarded to Snowball and Boxer. The reward was a bronze medal (which was actually a piece of brass found in the harness room) to be worn on holidays and Sundays.</t488> <t489>The title of Second Class Animal Hero was awarded to the sheep that had sacrificed itself.</t489>
<t490>They argued for a long time about what to name the victory.</t490> <t491>Finally, they decided to call it the Cow Shed Campaign because the ambush took place in a cow shed.</t491> <t492>They found Mr. Jones's gun in the mud, and there were still bullets available in the camp.</t492> <t493>The gun was placed at the foot of the flagpole, as if it were a cannon in other places, and they would fire it twice a year, once on the summer solstice to celebrate the Uprising, and again on the twentieth of October to celebrate the Victory.</t493>

<t496>Chapter 5</t496>
<t497>The closer it got to winter, the more irritable Mollie became.</t497> <t498>Every morning she was late for work, claiming she overslept; in addition, she complained of strange illnesses, although she ate like a horse.</t498> <t499>She often found ways to shirk work and run to the pond, standing there gazing at her reflection.</t499> <t500>But according to rumors, she had much more serious flaws.</t500> <t501>One day, as she was strolling in the yard, casually wagging her long tail and chewing a mouthful of grass, Mrs. Fat pulled her aside and said:</t501>
<t502>"Mollie, I have a few things to say to you.</t502> <t503>This morning I saw you standing by the fence between Animal Farm and Foxwood Farm.</t503> <t504>On the other side of the fence was someone from Pilkington's farm.</t504> <t505>Even though I was very far away, I am certain that he was talking to you, I saw it clearly, and you let him stroke your cheeks.</t505> <t506>Mollie, what is the meaning of this?"</t506>
<t507>"He didn't clap!"</t507> <t508>"You weren't standing there! That didn't happen!" - Mollie screamed, her legs jumping up and pounding loudly on the ground.</t508>
<t509>"Mollie, look straight into my eyes!</t509> <t510>Do you dare swear to me that guy has never patted your cheek?"</t510>
<t511>"There's no such thing!", Mollie repeated, but she didn't dare to look at Fat Lady and immediately dashed out to the field.</t511>
<t512>A thought suddenly flashed in Mrs. Fat's mind. Without telling any of the others, she slowly approached Mollie's stall and used her hoof to turn over the pile of straw in the stall.</t512> <t513>Under the pile of straw was a lump of sugar and several colorful ribbons.</t513>
<t514>Three days later, Mollie disappeared.</t514> <t515>Weeks went by without any news, but then the pigeons reported that they had seen Mollie outside Willingdon.</t515> <t516>She was pulling a small cart, splendidly painted in black and red, resting near a tavern.</t516> <t517>A stout man with a red face, wearing checkered trousers and gaiters, who seemed to be the tavern owner, was petting her and feeding her a piece of sugar.</t517> <t518>Her mane had been carefully trimmed and groomed, with a bright red ribbon tied to the tuft on her forehead.</t518> <t519>According to the pigeons, she looked satisfied.</t519> <t520>From then on, no one mentioned her again.</t520>
<t521>As January arrived, the weather became extremely harsh.</t521><t522>The ground was as hard as rock, making it impossible to do any work.</t522><t523>Meetings were moved to the large barn, and the pigs focused on planning for the next season.</t523><t524>They agreed that since the pigs were the smartest, they would be responsible for the overall direction of the farm, but their decisions had to be approved by an absolute majority.</t524><t525>Everything would have been perfect if Snowball and Napoleon didn't constantly oppose each other.</t525><t526>The two disagreed on every issue whenever they had the chance.</t526><t527>If one said more barley should be sown, the other would insist on sowing more oats; if one said a certain field was suitable for cabbages, the other would argue that only turnips could be grown there.</t527><t528>Each had a number of supporters, so the debates were often very intense.</t528><t529>Thanks to his eloquence, Snowball usually won the majority in the Meetings, while outside, the majority supported Napoleon.</t529><t530>The most loyal to Napoleon were the sheep.</t530><t531>Recently, the sheep often chanted "Four legs good, two legs bad" for any reason or no reason at all, frequently interrupting the Meetings.</t531><t532>Especially during the most important parts of Snowball's speeches, the sheep would invariably shout "Four legs good, two legs bad".</t532><t533>Snowball had studied the "Agriculture and Livestock" magazine found in the main house thoroughly, and his head was full of plans for reforming and modernizing production.</t533><t534>He talked about drainage systems for the fields, silage pits, and phosphate fertilizers for the entire farm; he even drafted a sanitation schedule so that each animal would "go" in a different place each time to save on transportation later.</t534><t535>Napoleon, on the other hand, didn't draft anything but whispered to the others that Snowball was just talking nonsense and seemed to be waiting for the right moment to act.</t535><t536>But the fiercest dispute between the two was over the construction of the windmill.</t536>
<t537>On the grass field, not far from the rows of houses of the farm, there was a small mound, which was also the highest point in the farm.</t537> <t538>After surveying, Snowball declared that this was the best area to build a windmill, and they would install a generator on it to supply electricity to the entire farm.</t538> <t539>The barns would then have electric lights, and in winter, there would be heaters, not to mention using electricity to run the saw, the grass cutter, the red beet slicer, and the milking machine.</t539> <t540>The animals had never heard of such things before (this farm was quite backward, only having the simplest machines), and they listened in amazement as Snowball enthusiastically talked about the wonderful machines that would do the work for them while they could leisurely graze in the fields or sit reading books and debating to gradually improve their minds.</t540>
<t541>Just a few weeks later, Tuyet Tron had completed the technical documents for the windmill project.</t541><t542>The detailed mechanical drawings were drafted based on three of Mr. Jones's books: "A Thousand Useful Household Items," "Do-It-Yourself Masonry," and "What a Beginner Electrician Needs to Know."</t542><t543>Tuyet Tron used the shed, which was previously an incubation area, as an office because it had a flat wooden floor that was very suitable for technical drawing.</t543><t544>Tuyet Tron sat in there for hours on end.</t544><t545>It placed a stone on the necessary book page, held a piece of chalk with one foot; it hopped back and forth, drawing as it hopped, sometimes squealing softly in delight.</t545><t546>Gradually, the drawings, consisting of numerous interlocking shafts and gears, covered nearly half of the shed, and although the other animals didn't understand them, they were extremely impressed.</t546><t547>Every day, the animals came to look at Tuyet Tron's drawings at least once.</t547><t548>Even the chickens and ducks came, but they stood at a distance to avoid stepping on the chalk drawings.</t548><t549>Only Napoleon didn't care at all.</t549><t550>He opposed it from the beginning.</t550><t551>Nevertheless, one day he came to inspect the project without informing any of the animals beforehand.</t551><t552>He walked around the shed, then went in to scrutinize the drawings, sniffing here and there, then lifted his leg and urinated on them, after which he calmly walked out without saying a word.</t552>
<t553>Due to the construction of the windmill, the farm was divided into two opposing factions.</t553> <t554>Snowball did not hide the fact that building the windmill would require a great sacrifice.</t554> <t555>They would have to quarry and transport stone to the site, then build, and only after that install the blades, motor, and electrical wiring (how to obtain those things, Snowball did not say).</t555> <t556>But he still asserted that the project could be completed within a year.</t556> <t557>After that, he declared, the workload would decrease significantly, and they would only have to work three days a week.</t557> <t558>On the other hand, Napoleon argued that the most important task at present was food production, and if they wasted time on building the windmill, they would starve.</t558> <t559>The animals divided into two factions; one faction adopted the slogan: "Support Snowball and three days of work a week"; the other adopted the slogan: "Support Napoleon and a full belly."</t559> <t560>Only Benjamin did not join any faction.</t560> <t561>He did not believe that food would become abundant, nor did he believe that the windmill would help reduce manual labor.</t561> <t562>With or without the windmill, it would be the same; they had lived as they did and would continue to live that way, meaning they would still suffer.</t562>
<t563>Besides the windmill, they also argued about defense.</t563> <t564>Everyone understood that although humans were defeated in the Battle of the Cowshed, they would certainly fight another battle, this one fiercer, to reclaim the farm for Mr. Jones.</t564> <t565>People were bound to do so because rumors of the humans' great defeat had spread throughout the countryside, and the animals in other farms had now become more rebellious than ever.</t565> <t566>As always, Snowball and Napoleon could not find common ground.</t566> <t567>According to Napoleon, the first thing to do was to purchase and learn to use firearms.</t567> <t568>According to Snowball, the urgent task now was to send flocks of pigeons to other farms to incite rebellions there.</t568> <t569>One believed that if they could not defend themselves, they would certainly be conquered by humans, while the other argued that if rebellions broke out everywhere, there would be no need for defense.</t569> <t570>The animals listened to Napoleon and then to Snowball, but could not decide who was right; in fact, whoever was speaking at the moment seemed right to them, as they had no firm opinions of their own.</t570>
<t571>Finally, Snowball completed all the drawings for his project.</t571><t572>In the meeting on Sunday, the issue of building the windmill was put to a vote.</t572><t573>All the animals gathered in the large barn, Snowball spoke first and although he was occasionally interrupted by the sheep, he convincingly presented the benefits of the windmill.</t573><t574>Then it was Napoleon's turn.</t574><t575>He calmly declared that the windmill was nonsense and advised everyone not to support the project; he spoke for only about thirty seconds and then sat down calmly, seemingly indifferent to the effect he had on the audience.</t575><t576>Snowball stood up on his hind legs and immediately delivered a passionate speech to persuade the others to vote for the construction of the windmill, speaking so loudly that he drowned out the sheep.</t576><t577>Previously, the farm was divided into two equal factions, but this time Snowball had convinced the majority to support him.</t577><t578>He spoke about the future of Animal Farm, a very bright future where manual labor would no longer weigh heavily on their backs.</t578><t579>His imagination went beyond straw cutters and beet slicers.</t579><t580>Electricity, he said, could power threshers, plows, harrows, rollers; it could also provide lighting, hot water, cold water, and heating for all the stalls.</t580><t581>The result of the vote was clear even before Snowball finished his speech.</t581><t582>But just at that moment, Napoleon stood up, glanced sharply at Snowball, and let out a high-pitched squeal like a whistle, a sound none of them had ever heard before.</t582>
<t583>There was a loud barking outside, then a pack of nine extremely large dogs with brass collars charged into the barn.</t583> <t584>They rushed straight at Snowball, but luckily he dodged their snapping jaws.</t584> <t585>Snowball hurriedly ran outside with the pack of dogs chasing after him.</t585> <t586>The remaining animals were extremely surprised and frightened, and they all rushed to the door to watch the chase.</t586> <t587>Snowball ran across the meadow towards the main road.</t587> <t588>He ran for his life while the pack of dogs kept right on his heels.</t588> <t589>Suddenly, he slipped, and it seemed like the dogs would catch him any moment.</t589> <t590>But he managed to get back up, this time running even faster with the dogs still in close pursuit.</t590> <t591>It seemed as if one of the dogs had caught Snowball's tail, but he managed to flick it to the side just in time.</t591> <t592>He sped up again, this time gaining some distance from the dogs, and then he squeezed through a hole in the fence.</t592> <t593>None of the dogs could see Snowball anymore.</t593>
<t594>Extremely frightened, the animals silently turned back to the barn.</t594> <t595>The hunting dogs also returned shortly after.</t595> <t596>At first, each one wondered: where did those dogs come from?</t596> <t597>But then it was no longer a secret: these dogs had been taken by Napoleon when they were young and raised separately.</t597> <t598>Though not fully grown, they looked big and fierce like wolves.</t598> <t599>They stood right next to Napoleon.</t599> <t600>They also wagged their tails at Napoleon just like the others used to do for Mr. Jones.</t600>
<t601>Napoleon, escorted by the dogs, stepped onto the platform where the Leader used to speak.</t601> <t602>He declared that from now on, the weekly Sunday Meetings would be abolished.</t602> <t603>He said that those Meetings were pointless and only a waste of time.</t603> <t604>From now on, matters related to the farm's work would be resolved by a committee of pigs with Napoleon as the chairman.</t604> <t605>These would be closed Meetings, and the resolutions would be announced to the entire farm afterward.</t605> <t606>The animals would still gather on Sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing "Beasts of England," and receive their work assignments for the following week, but there would be no more discussions.</t606>
<t607>Although shocked by Tuyet Tron’s expulsion, the decision to cancel the discussions left everyone completely disappointed.</t607> <t608>Some of them would certainly protest if they could find a plausible argument.</t608> <t609>Even Vo Si felt uneasy.</t609> <t610>He pricked up his ears, shook his mane a few times, thoughts jumping around, and despite trying very hard, he still didn't know what to say.</t610> <t611>But the pigs were more articulate.</t611> <t612>The four porkers in the front row shouted in protest, then all four jumped up and spoke in unison.</t612> <t613>But the dogs surrounding Napoleon barked loudly, and those pigs had to shut their mouths and quietly return to their places.</t613> <t614>Then the sheep started their chant of "Four legs good, two legs bad," which lasted about fifteen minutes, ending all discussions.</t614> <t615>Chỉ Điểm was sent to explain to the others.</t615>
<t616>"Comrades," said Chỉ Điểm, "I hope that all of you appreciate the sacrifice of Comrade Napoleon when he took on the responsibility of leading the farm.</t616><t617>Do not think that leadership is an easy task!</t617><t618>On the contrary, it is an extremely heavy and difficult responsibility.</t618><t619>None of us believe as deeply as Comrade Napoleon that all animals are born equal.</t619><t620>He would be very happy if you could decide your own fate.</t620><t621>But who can guarantee that sometimes you will not make the wrong decision, and what will happen to our farm then?</t621><t622>For example, what if you follow Snowball with his fanciful windmill, follow someone whose actions are no different from a criminal?"</t622>
<t623>"He fought bravely in the Cow Shed Campaign," someone spoke up.</t623>
<t624>"Courage alone is not enough," Chỉ Điểm said, "Loyalty and obedience are even more important.</t624> <t625>Speaking of the Cow Shed Campaign, I believe there will come a time when we see that Tuyết Tròn's role has been grossly exaggerated.</t625> <t626>Discipline, comrades, iron discipline!</t626> <t627>That is our slogan in the current phase.</t627> <t628>Just one misstep and the enemy will attack immediately.</t628> <t629>Surely you don't want old Jones to come back, do you?"</t629>
<t630>Its argument was indeed hard to refute.</t630> <t631>Surely, none of them wanted Mr. Jones to come back, and if the Sunday debates gave him an excuse to return, they would stop arguing.</t631> <t632>Boxer thought it over carefully and spoke on behalf of everyone:</t632>
<t633>"Comrade Napoleon is always right.</t633> <t634>Comrade Napoleon is never wrong."</t634>
<t635>From then on, besides "I will try harder", Chiến Sĩ also had a new slogan: "Comrade Napoleon is always right".</t635>
<t636>The weather has gradually warmed up, marking the start of a new plowing season.</t636><t637>The warehouse, where Tuyet Tron designed the windmill, has been closed, and perhaps the drawings have also been erased.</t637><t638>Every Sunday at ten in the morning, the animals gather in the large barn to receive production tasks for the following week.</t638><t639>The Leader's skull, now just bones, was dug up and placed on a tree stump, next to the gun, at the foot of the flagpole.</t639><t640>After attending the flag-raising ceremony, the animals must solemnly march past the Leader's skull before entering the barn.</t640><t641>Now they no longer sit mixed together as they used to.</t641><t642>Napoleon, Chỉ Điểm, and Kế Tục, a pig with a talent for composing songs and poems, sat on the wooden platform, nine dogs forming a semicircle around them, with the other pigs sitting behind.</t642><t643>The remaining animals sat on the floor.</t643><t644>Napoleon read out the work assignments for the following week, then they sang "Beasts of England" once and dispersed.</t644>
<t645>On the third Sunday since Snowball's expulsion, the animals suddenly heard Napoleon declare that the windmill must be built.</t645> <t646>He did not explain why he changed his decision, but said that this task would require everyone to make great efforts and sacrifices, including the possibility of reducing daily rations.</t646> <t647>The project had been detailed to the last detail.</t647> <t648>A committee of pigs had been studying this project for the past three weeks.</t648> <t649>The construction of the windmill and other auxiliary works could take up to two years.</t649>
<t650>In the afternoon, Squealer came to explain to each animal that actually Napoleon was not opposed to the construction of the windmill.</t650> <t651>On the contrary, from the very beginning, he had supported the project, and the drawings they saw in the incubator were stolen by Snowball from Napoleon.</t651> <t652>The windmill was Napoleon's own initiative.</t652> <t653>Then why - some animals asked - was Napoleon so adamantly against it before?</t653> <t654>Squealer appeared very cunning.</t654> <t655>That - he explained - was the cleverness of Comrade Napoleon.</t655> <t656>He only pretended to be against it to get rid of Snowball, a dangerous enemy who could lead them astray at any moment.</t656> <t657>Now, with Snowball gone, they could proceed without fearing any more disturbances from him.</t657> <t658>That is called tactics, Squealer said.</t658> <t659>He repeated: "Tactics, comrades, it is all tactics," while smiling and jumping around, his tail wagging furiously.</t659> <t660>The animals did not understand anything, but Squealer spoke very eloquently, and the three dogs accompanying him suddenly barked loudly, so they accepted without further questions.</t660>
<t661>George Orwell</t661>
<t662>Animal Farm</t662>
<t663>Chapter 6</t663>
<t664>Throughout that year, the animals had to work tirelessly, no different from slaves.</t664> <t665>But working was a joy for them; they spared no effort and were ready to accept any sacrifice because they knew they were working for themselves and their offspring, not for a bunch of lazy, thieving humans anymore.</t665>
<t666>Throughout the spring and summer, they worked sixty-four hours a week, but by August, Napoleon declared that they would work Sunday afternoons as well.</t666> <t667>This work was completely voluntary, but any animal absent would have their rations cut by half.</t667> <t668>Despite this, they still could not complete the planned tasks.</t668> <t669>This year’s harvest was worse than last year’s, and they did not manage to plant turnips on two fields because the plowing was too slow.</t669> <t670>It could be foreseen that the coming winter would bring many difficulties.</t670>
<t671>The construction of the windmill encountered quite a few troubles.</t671> <t672>Right on the farm, there was a good limestone quarry, sand was also plentiful, and cement was readily available in the warehouse; all building materials were sufficient.</t672> <t673>But there was one problem that the animals couldn't solve immediately, which was how to break the stones into pieces of the desired size.</t673> <t674>It seemed that the only way was to use pickaxes and crowbars; but none of them knew how to use those tools because they couldn't stand on their hind legs.</t674> <t675>It took them several weeks of tinkering to figure out how to utilize the force of gravity.</t675> <t676>The large rocks, which couldn't be used, lay at the bottom of the limestone quarry.</t676> <t677>The animals wrapped ropes around the rocks, and then all of them, whether cows, horses, or sheep, any animal that could hold onto the rope was present, and in emergencies, even the pigs grabbed the rope and slowly pulled it up the slope, then they let the rock fall to the bottom to break into smaller pieces.</t677> <t678>Transporting the broken stones was not difficult.</t678> <t679>The horses transported them using small carts, the sheep carried them one by one, even Muriel and Benjamin harnessed themselves to a two-wheeled cart and participated in the transportation. By the end of the summer, they had gathered enough stones, the construction work began, and the pigs took on the roles of supervisors and foremen.</t679>
<t680>But the construction proceeded very slowly, consuming a lot of effort.</t680> <t681>They often took an entire day just to pull a stone to the top, but when they dropped it, it wouldn't break.</t681> <t682>Without Warrior, nothing would get done properly; it alone did the work of all the others combined.</t682> <t683>If the stone was too heavy and the whole group was dragged down, Warrior would always strive to pull it up.</t683> <t684>Everyone had to admire it when they saw it, feet firmly planted on the ground, breathing heavily, sides drenched in sweat, striving to pull the stones up step by step.</t684> <t685>Fatty occasionally reminded it not to overwork, but it wouldn't listen.</t685> <t686>It seemed that for it, the two slogans: "I will try harder" and "Comrade Napoleon is always right" were the answers to every problem.</t686> <t687>It even asked the rooster to wake it up forty-five minutes earlier instead of half an hour as before.</t687> <t688>In its spare time, which was now very limited, it would go alone to the quarry, arrange the broken stones, and pull them to the windmill construction site without any help.</t688>
<t689>Although they had to work hard, the animals' lives in the summer were not too bad.</t689> <t690>They did not eat more than they did during Mr. Jones's time, but they did not eat less either.</t690> <t691>In return, they only had to work to feed themselves; they did not have to feed the five greedy humans anymore, and this alone was enough to motivate them to overcome all the piled-up difficulties.</t691> <t692>Moreover, the animals' methods were often efficient and quick.</t692> <t693>For example, they weeded faster and more neatly than humans.</t693> <t694>Now that no animal was stealing, there was no need to repair the fences and gates between the pasture and the cultivated area anymore.</t694> <t695>But from that summer, shortages began to occur, now this thing, now that thing.</t695> <t696>They needed oil, nails, ropes, dog biscuits, iron for horseshoes, things that Animal Farm could not produce.</t696> <t697>Then there were seeds, chemical fertilizers, tools like hoes and shovels, and even equipment for the windmill.</t697> <t698>No animal knew how to buy those things.</t698>
<t699>One Sunday morning, when the animals gathered to receive their tasks for the upcoming week, Napoleon suddenly announced that he had decided to implement a new policy.</t699> <t700>From now on, Animal Farm would trade with neighboring farms: of course, not for profit but only to purchase some truly necessary supplies.</t700> <t701>The task of building the windmill is of utmost importance to us, he said.</t701> <t702>Therefore, he had negotiated the sale of hay and part of the last wheat crop, and later, if more money was needed, they might have to sell eggs, as the demand for eggs in Willingdon was very high.</t702> <t703>Comrades, the hens, Napoleon said, should be proud to have made special contributions to the construction of the windmill.</t703>
<t704>Once again, the animals felt anxious.</t704><t705>No dealings with humans, no engaging in trade, no use of money - weren't these the resolutions passed at the first Meeting celebrating the victory after driving out Mr. Jones?</t705><t706>All the animals remembered that they had passed those resolutions, or at least they thought they remembered.</t706><t707>The four pigs who had stood up to protest when Napoleon announced the cancellation of the weekend Meetings were about to speak again, but they quickly shut their mouths because the dogs had started barking loudly.</t707><t708>As always, the sheep began chanting "Four legs good, two legs bad!" and everything settled down.</t708><t709>Finally, Napoleon raised his hoof to call for order and declared that he had resolved everything satisfactorily.</t709><t710>No animal would have to deal with humans, as it was not a pleasant task.</t710><t711>He would take full responsibility for that heavy task.</t711><t712>A lawyer currently living in Willingdon named Whymper had agreed to act as an intermediary between Animal Farm and the neighboring farms; he would take up his duties on Monday mornings each week.</t712><t713>As usual, Napoleon ended his speech by shouting the slogan "Long live Animal Farm" and after singing "Beasts of England," the animals dispersed.</t713>
<t714>After that, Chỉ Điểm went around the camp to conduct ideological work.</t714> <t715>He assured that the decision not to trade and not to use money had never been put to a vote, let alone passed.</t715> <t716>That was just a fabrication, and if traced back to the beginning, it might have been made up by Tuyết Tròn.</t716> <t717>But some still did not believe, so Chỉ Điểm asked: "Comrade, are you sure you didn't imagine it? Do you have any documents confirming that?</t717> <t718>Where is that decision recorded?".</t718> <t719>Surely those decisions were not recorded anywhere, so in the end, the animals believed they were mistaken.</t719>
<t720>Every Monday, Mr. Whymper came to the farm.</t720> <t721>He was a small-statured lawyer with long sideburns, just starting out in business, but quite shrewd, immediately recognizing that Animal Farm would definitely need a broker and that the commission would naturally be "substantial."</t721> <t722>The animals were afraid of Whymper and tried to avoid him as much as possible.</t722> <t723>Nevertheless, the fact that Napoleon, standing on four legs, gave orders to Whymper, who stood on two legs, instilled in them a legitimate sense of pride and somewhat mitigated their reaction to the new policy.</t723> <t724>Their relationship with humans was no longer the same as before.</t724> <t725>The humans' hatred for Animal Farm not only did not decrease but actually increased as it became more prosperous.</t725> <t726>Everyone believed that sooner or later the farm would go bankrupt, and the windmill was sure to fail.</t726> <t727>They often gathered in pubs and drew diagrams to prove that the windmill would definitely collapse, and even if it didn't, it would never work.</t727> <t728>But despite their dislike, they had to respect the animals because they managed the farm quite efficiently.</t728> <t729>The proof was that they had started calling it Animal Farm and had stopped pretending it was still named Manor Farm. They also no longer supported Mr. Jones, who had lost all hope of reclaiming the farm and had gone to work elsewhere.</t729> <t730>Although currently all relations between Animal Farm and the outside world were conducted through Whymper, there were rumors that Napoleon was about to sign a trade agreement either with Pilkington's Foxwood Farm or Frederick's Pinchfield Farm, but people also said that there would be no deal with both farms at the same time.</t730>
<t731>Around that time, the pigs suddenly moved into the main house.</t731> <t732>This time, the animals also believed that from the very beginning they had decided that no one was allowed to move into the main house.</t732> <t733>Squealer once again convinced them that they were mistaken.</t733> <t734>The pigs were the brains of the entire farm, he said, so they needed quiet places to work.</t734> <t735>The Leader (recently he had started calling Napoleon the Leader) had to live in a worthy place and couldn't just keep living in a pigsty.</t735> <t736>However, some were worried when they heard that the pigs not only ate in the kitchen and rested in the living room but also slept in beds.</t736> <t737>Boxer still said "Comrade Napoleon is always right," but Clover thought there surely was a rule against sleeping in beds, so she went to the end of the barn to check the Seven Commandments. But she could only recognize the letters and couldn't read the words, so she had to find Muriel.</t737>
<t738>"Muriel," Fatty said, "read me the Fourth Commandment. Is it that we should never sleep in a bed?"</t738>
<t739>Muriel had to spell it out for a long time before finishing.</t739>
<t740>"This Commandment reads: No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets," Muriel said.</t740>
<t741>It's strange, Fat Lady remembered that the Fourth Commandment didn't mention bed sheets, but if it was clearly written on the wall like that, then it must be so.</t741> <t742>At that moment, Chỉ Điểm, along with two or three dogs, accidentally walked by.</t742>
<t743>"Comrades," it said, "I think you know that we pigs have been sleeping in beds already? Why not?</t743> <t744>Do you really think there is a rule against sleeping in beds?</t744> <t745>What is a bed, but a place to sleep?</t745> <t746>In fact, a pile of straw in a barn is also a bed.</t746> <t747>The rule is against sleeping with sheets, because those are a human invention.</t747> <t748>We have removed all the sheets, now we only use blankets.</t748> <t749>Beds are actually very convenient!</t749> <t750>But they are not too luxurious, I can tell you that they are exactly what we need for intellectual workers like us.</t750> <t751>Don't you want us to rest?</t751> <t752>Do you want us to be exhausted?</t752> <t753>Surely none of you want old Jones to come back, right?"</t753>
<t754>The animals assured it that they did not think so, and from then on, no one mentioned the pigs sleeping in beds anymore.</t754> <t755>A few days later, it was announced that from now on, the pigs would get up an hour later than the other animals; this time, no one complained at all.</t755>
<t756>Autumn arrived, and although the animals were tired, they were happy.</t756> <t757>The past year had been a hard one; they had to sell some of the hay and grain, so the winter reserves were not very abundant, but the windmill compensated for all their efforts.</t757> <t758>The windmill was nearly halfway built.</t758> <t759>After the harvest, the weather was very favorable, and the animals worked harder than ever before, willing to move and carry things all day as long as the wall grew taller, even if just a little.</t759> <t760>At night, Boxer would even put in an extra hour or two under the moonlight.</t760> <t761>In their free time, the animals often strolled around the construction site, admiring the straight and sturdy walls; they wondered if they had really built such a magnificent structure.</t761> <t762>Only Benjamin remained unchanged; he said nothing except his usual remark that donkeys live a long time.</t762>
<t763>November begins with southwest winds.</t763> <t764>Construction work was halted because it was too damp to mix mortar.</t764> <t765>One night, the wind was so strong that the roof tiles were blown off, and the walls seemed on the verge of collapsing.</t765> <t766>The chickens woke up and clucked loudly because they all dreamt of hearing gunshots somewhere.</t766> <t767>In the morning, when the animals came out of the barn, they saw that the flagpole had fallen, and the elm tree at the end of the garden had been uprooted as if someone had pulled up a radish.</t767> <t768>But that was not all; in front of them was an even more terrifying sight.</t768> <t769>The windmill had completely collapsed.</t769> <t770>They all cried out in unison in despair.</t770>
<t771>They rushed towards the construction site.</t771> <t772>Napoleon, who always considered running to be beneath him, was now at the head of the group, running as fast as he could.</t772> <t773>It was all over; everything had gone to waste. The stones they had painstakingly broken and transported were now scattered everywhere.</t773> <t774>Speechless, they stood silently, painfully gazing at the pile of fallen stones.</t774> <t775>Napoleon walked back and forth in silence, occasionally sniffing the ground.</t775> <t776>His tail was stretched out, wagging vigorously, indicating that he was deep in thought.</t776> <t777>Suddenly, he stopped, which meant he had found a solution.</t777>
<t778>"Comrades," he calmly said, "do you know who is responsible for this?</t778> <t779>Who sabotaged, who destroyed our windmill last night?</t779> <t780>Snowball!" he suddenly shouted, "it was Snowball, no one else.</t780> <t781>That treacherous traitor has heartlessly sought to ruin us and take revenge for his humiliating expulsion; he took advantage of the darkness to sneak in and destroy the entire year's worth of our labor.</t781> <t782>Today, here, I declare a death sentence on Snowball.</t782> <t783>Whoever kills him will be awarded Animal Hero, Second Class, and half a barrel of apples.</t783> <t784>Whoever captures him alive will be rewarded with a full barrel of apples."</t784>
<t785>Every animal was extremely furious upon hearing the news that Snowball had committed such a heinous crime.</t785> <t786>Their anger erupted into screams, and each one thought of ways to capture Snowball alive if he was still lurking around.</t786> <t787>They also discovered pig tracks on the grass near the hill.</t787> <t788>The tracks extended for about ten meters, seemingly heading towards a hole in the fence.</t788> <t789>Napoleon sniffed the tracks deeply and then declared that they were Snowball's tracks.</t789> <t790>Napoleon said that Snowball might have come from the direction of Foxwood Farm.</t790>
<t791>"Slow means death," Napoleon declared after examining the footprints, "we must continue the work, comrades! We will start rebuilding the windmill from this very morning, we will work throughout this winter, regardless of wind, rain, or cold.</t791> <t792>We will teach that treacherous scoundrel a lesson that he cannot stop us.</t792> <t793>Please remember, comrades: our plan remains unchanged.</t793> <t794>We are determined to complete the construction of the windmill on time.</t794> <t795>Comrades, forward! Long live the windmill! Long live Animal Farm!".</t795>

<t797>Animal Farm</t797>
<t798>Chapter 7</t798>
<t799>The winter that year was very harsh.</t799> <t800>Storms followed by rain, then snow and frost; by February, the ice had not yet melted.</t800> <t801>Yet the animals diligently rebuilt the windmill, knowing that people were watching them and those wicked people would have a reason to rejoice if they did not complete the project on time.</t801>
<t802>To provoke them, people even pretended not to believe that Snowball had destroyed the windmill; they claimed it collapsed because the walls were too thin.</t802> <t803>But the animals were convinced that wasn't the case.</t803> <t804>In any case, they decided to build the walls one meter thick instead of forty centimeters as before, which meant they needed to quarry more stone than before.</t804> <t805>The quarry had been buried under snow for a long time, so they couldn't start.</t805> <t806>After that, although the weather was cold, it was dry, but the work was truly dreadful, and the animals were no longer as enthusiastic as before.</t806> <t807>They were not only cold but also constantly hungry.</t807> <t808>Only Boxer and Clover remained enthusiastic.</t808> <t809>Squealer encouraged the movement with speeches, eloquently proving that labor was happiness and glory.</t809> <t810>But Squealer's speeches had no effect; it was Boxer's strength and his motto "I will work harder" that greatly motivated the others.</t810>
<t811>Food supplies began to run out in January.</t811> <t812>Rations of grain were reduced, replaced by potatoes.</t812> <t813>It was then discovered that most of the piled-up potatoes had rotted due to improper covering, leaving very few edible ones.</t813> <t814>Many days, they only had grass and turnips to eat.</t814> <t815>Famine began to threaten.</t815>
<t816>This information must be kept strictly confidential, not to be disclosed to those around.</t816> <t817>Excited by the collapse of the windmill, people spread even more false rumors about Animal Farm.</t817> <t818>They gossiped that the animals were on the verge of dying from hunger and disease, that they fought all day, that they were eating each other, and even killing the young ones.</t818> <t819>Napoleon understood that there would be many troubles if outsiders knew the farm was facing food shortages, so he decided to use Whymper as a tool for counter-propaganda.</t819> <t820>Previously, the animals usually stood at a distance whenever Whymper visited the farm, but now some selected ones, mainly sheep, were allowed to come closer and, as if by chance, mention that rations had increased lately.</t820> <t821>Additionally, Napoleon ordered sand to be poured almost to the brim of the bins in the storehouse and then covered it with grain and flour.</t821> <t822>Whenever there was an opportunity, they would lead Whymper past the storehouse so he could see the food stored there.</t822> <t823>Whymper was deceived and often told everyone that Animal Farm still had enough food.</t823>
<t824>However, by the end of January, it became clear that they needed to find a way to buy more grain.</t824> <t825>These days, Napoleon rarely went outside; he stayed in the main house, with fierce dogs guarding all the entrances strictly.</t825> <t826>If he did go outside, he was always escorted by six dogs, who would immediately bare their teeth and growl threateningly if any other animals came near.</t826> <t827>He also no longer participated in the Sunday Meetings, delegating another pig, usually Squealer, to read the work assignments instead.</t827>
<t828>One time, on a Sunday, Chỉ Điểm declared that the hens, who had just started laying eggs, must hand over their eggs.</t828> <t829>Through Whymper, Napoleon had signed a contract to supply four hundred eggs each week.</t829> <t830>The money from selling the eggs would be enough to buy food until summer, and by then everything would be easier.</t830>
<t831>The hens squawked loudly.</t831> <t832>Previously, they had been reminded that they needed to sacrifice, but they did not expect things to be this bad.</t832> <t833>They had prepared nests for the spring hatching, declaring that taking the eggs now was akin to murder.</t833> <t834>Since the expulsion of Mr. Jones, this was the first time there had been a gathering resembling a riot.</t834> <t835>Three young Minorca hens led the uprising against Napoleon's plan.</t835> <t836>Their tactic was to fly up to the rafters and lay their eggs so they would break.</t836> <t837>Napoleon acted swiftly and decisively.</t837> <t838>He ordered that the hens were not to be fed and declared that anyone giving them even a grain of corn would be executed immediately.</t838> <t839>The dogs were assigned to monitor them.</t839> <t840>The hens held out for five days, but eventually had to surrender and return to laying in their nests as before.</t840> <t841>Nine hens died.</t841> <t842>They were considered to have died from coccidiosis and were buried in the garden.</t842> <t843>Whymper knew nothing of this and a cart came weekly to collect the eggs.</t843>
<t844>Snowball was nowhere to be seen.</t844> <t845>There were rumors that he was hiding in Foxwood or Pinchfield.</t845> <t846>Relations between Napoleon and the surrounding farms had somewhat improved.</t846> <t847>At that time, they suddenly discovered a pile of timber in the yard, which had been felled about ten years ago.</t847> <t848>The timber was found at just the right time, and Whymper advised Napoleon to sell it; both Pilkington and Frederick wanted to buy it.</t848> <t849>Napoleon hesitated, not knowing whom to sell it to.</t849> <t850>Whenever he decided to sell to Frederick, there would be news that Snowball was hiding in Foxwood, but when he leaned towards Pilkington, there would be news that Snowball was in Pinchfield.</t850>
<t851>At the beginning of January, the entire camp suddenly became agitated because of an unexpected piece of news, like a bolt from the blue.</t851> <t852>It turned out that Snowball had been secretly infiltrating the camp at night!</t852> <t853>The animals were so worried that they lost sleep.</t853> <t854>It was rumored that every night Snowball would sneak in to cause havoc.</t854> <t855>He stole food, knocked over milk pails, broke eggs, trampled the seedlings, and chewed the bark of the trees in the garden.</t855> <t856>Any difficulty or failure was blamed on Snowball.</t856> <t857>If a window was broken or a drain was clogged, someone would say it was Snowball's doing, and even when the warehouse key was lost, the whole camp believed Snowball had thrown it down the well.</t857> <t858>The strange thing was that even after the key was found under a sack of flour, the whole camp still believed it was Snowball's fault.</t858> <t859>The cows insisted that at night Snowball would sneak into the barn and steal milk while they slept.</t859> <t860>It was rumored that the rats, which had caused a lot of trouble last winter, were also in league with Snowball.</t860>
<t861>Napoleon ordered a thorough investigation into the activities of Snowball.</t861> <t862>Napoleon, escorted by a few dogs, surveyed all the buildings in the farm, while others followed at a distance.</t862> <t863>He claimed he could smell Snowball, so he would stop every few steps to sniff the ground for traces.</t863> <t864>He sniffed every corner, including the warehouse, the cow shed, the chicken coop, the vegetable garden, and found traces of Snowball everywhere.</t864> <t865>He pressed his nose to the ground several times, inhaled deeply, and then declared in a chilling voice: "Snowball! He has been here!</t865> <t866>I have recognized his scent!" Every time the word "Snowball" was mentioned, the dogs would bare their teeth and bark in agreement.</t866>
<t867>Everyone trembled with fear.</t867> <t868>It felt as if the mysterious and powerful Tuyet Tron was lurking somewhere nearby, ready to unleash disaster upon them.</t868> <t869>That night, Chi Diem called everyone together and with a serious face, said that there was some urgent news to announce.</t869>
<t870>"Comrades!", he shouted, "we have discovered an unforgivable crime.</t870> <t871>Snowball has sold himself to Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is planning to attack and seize our farm! Once war breaks out, Snowball will act as a guide.</t871> <t872>But he is even more unscrupulous than that.</t872> <t873>Previously, we thought that Snowball's disruptions were due to his vanity and lust for power.</t873> <t874>But comrades, we were wrong.</t874> <t875>Do you know where the real reason lies?</t875> <t876>From the very beginning, he has been in league with Jones!</t876> <t877>He is Jones's undercover spy.</t877> <t878>The evidence is in the documents he left behind, which we have only recently discovered.</t878> <t879>Comrades, I believe that explains a lot.</t879> <t880>Haven't we realized that he tried, fortunately unsuccessfully, to make us lose and disband during the Battle of the Cowshed?"</t880>
<t881>Everyone was stunned.</t881> <t882>This crime was truly horrifying, far worse than the destruction of the windmill.</t882> <t883>It took them a while to fully grasp the severity of the situation.</t883> <t884>They all still remembered, or thought they remembered, the image of Snowball leading the charge in the Battle of the Cowshed, uniting and encouraging them, never giving up even after being wounded by Jones.</t884> <t885>It was hard to imagine how that could have happened if he had been Jones's spy.</t885> <t886>Even Boxer, usually so taciturn, felt confused.</t886> <t887>Boxer lay down, tucked his forelegs under his belly, closed his eyes, tried to concentrate, and finally said:</t887>
<t888>"I don't believe it, during the Snowball Barn Campaign, he fought bravely.</t888> <t889>I saw it with my own eyes.</t889> <t890>Didn't we just honor him as a First Class Animal Hero right after the campaign?"</t890>
<t891>"Comrades, that is precisely our mistake."</t891> <t892>"Now we know that these matters are clearly documented in the secret files we have just found; it was intended to lure us into a trap for the others to eliminate us."</t892>
<t893>"But it was also injured," said the Warrior, "we all saw the blood flowing as it was running."</t893>
<t894>"It was all prearranged!", Squealer shouted, "Jones's shot only grazed him.</t894> <t895>If only you comrades could read, I could show you how Snowball wrote it all down in black and white.</t895> <t896>They had agreed that at the most critical moment, Snowball would order a retreat, leaving the battlefield to the enemy.</t896> <t897>And he almost succeeded, I can say he certainly would have succeeded if it weren't for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon.</t897> <t898>Do you remember when Jones and his men entered the yard? Snowball turned tail and many of the animals followed him.</t898> <t899>Don't you remember that at that very moment, when chaos began to spread and it seemed the front was about to break, Comrade Napoleon charged forward and shouted "Kill!" and then dashed straight at Jones's legs?</t899> <t900>Comrades, surely you remember that detail!", Squealer said, hopping from side to side.</t900>
<t901>Now, when Chỉ Điểm described it so vividly, the animals seemed to remember.</t901> <t902>In any case, they clearly remembered that Tuyết Tròn had turned and run at the critical moment.</t902> <t903>But Chiến Sĩ still felt uneasy.</t903>
<t904>"I don't believe that Snowball betrayed us from the beginning," he said, "later on, it was a different story."</t904> <t905>"I believe that during the Cowshed Campaign, Snowball was still a good comrade."</t905>
<t906>"Our leader, Comrade Napoleon," Squealer said slowly and firmly, "has categorically declared, I repeat, comrades, categorically declared that from the very beginning Snowball has been a spy for Mr. Jones, even before we thought about the Rebellion."</t906>
<t907>"That's different!", Chiến Sỹ said, "Comrade Napoleon has spoken, so it must be right."</t907>
<t908>"That is a truly constructive attitude, comrades!", Chỉ Điểm exclaimed, but everyone could see its narrow, shifty, resentful eyes glaring straight at Chiến Sĩ. It was about to leave, but added menacingly, "I must warn you all to be vigilant.</t908> <t909>There is ample reason to believe that there are still agents of Tuyết Tròn in this camp!"</t909>
<t910>Four days later, in the afternoon, Napoleon ordered everyone to be present in the yard.</t910> <t911>When everyone had gathered, Napoleon appeared, wearing two medals on his chest (he had recently awarded himself the titles of Animal Hero First Class and Animal Hero Second Class) with nine large dogs, running around and barking so loudly that the animals were terrified to the point of getting goosebumps.</t911> <t912>They sat silently, huddled together, as if awaiting a fierce storm.</t912>
<t913>Napoleon sternly looked at the crowd, then hissed sharply like a whistle.</t913> <t914>Immediately, the dogs rushed in to bite the ears of four pigs, some of which fainted from pain and fear, then dragged themselves to Napoleon's feet.</t914> <t915>Blood flowed from the pigs' ears, and the dogs went mad when they smelled the fresh blood.</t915> <t916>Everyone was even more surprised when three dogs charged at Boxer. Boxer quickly raised his leg to grab one and pinned it to the ground.</t916> <t917>That dog immediately cried out for mercy, while the other two tucked their tails and ran away.</t917> <t918>Boxer looked at Napoleon as if to ask whether to crush or release the captured dog.</t918> <t919>Napoleon changed his expression and ordered Boxer to release it, so Boxer lifted his leg, and the pitiful dog, bruised all over, limped away while whimpering.</t919>
<t920>Order was quickly restored.</t920> <t921>Four pigs lay awaiting their fate, trembling, guilt evident on every face.</t921> <t922>Napoleon ordered them to confess their crimes.</t922> <t923>These were the four pigs who had stood up to oppose Napoleon when he decided to abolish the Sunday Meetings.</t923> <t924>They immediately confessed to having secretly communicated with Snowball since his expulsion, helped him destroy the windmill, and conspired with him to sell Animal Farm to Frederick. They also added that Snowball had told them he had been Jones's spy for years.</t924> <t925>As soon as they finished speaking, the dogs leapt up and tore out their throats, after which Napoleon, in a menacing voice that sent chills down their spines, asked if any other animal felt the need to confess.</t925>
<t926>The three chickens who led the rebellion over the eggs stepped forward and declared that they had dreamt of Snowball inciting them to disobey Napoleon's orders.</t926> <t927>They were also executed.</t927> <t928>Then a goose stepped forward and confessed to having stolen six ears of corn from the last harvest to eat at night.</t928> <t929>Next, a ewe confessed that Snowball had incited her to urinate in the drinking water, and then two more sheep confessed to having tortured an old ram to death, a ram particularly loyal to Napoleon, by chasing it around the bonfire when it was coughing.</t929> <t930>All of these animals were executed on the spot.</t930> <t931>Thus, execution immediately followed confession.</t931> <t932>Soon, at Napoleon's feet lay a pile of corpses, and the air was thick with the smell of fresh blood, a scene unprecedented since the expulsion of Mr. Jones.</t932>
<t933>The remaining animals after the execution, of course excluding the dogs and pigs, gathered into a group and quietly crawled out of the yard.</t933> <t934>They looked so small and miserable.</t934> <t935>They couldn't understand whether the betrayal of those associated with Snowball or the brutal punishment they had just witnessed was more shocking.</t935> <t936>In the past, they had witnessed equally barbaric massacres, but this time it was clearly more terrifying because it was them killing each other.</t936> <t937>Since old Jones left, no animal had been killed.</t937> <t938>Not even a rat had been killed.</t938> <t939>They went up the hill and lay close together for warmth next to the half-built windmill: Fatty lay next to Mona, Benjamin, then the cows, sheep, chickens, and geese, with only the cat missing, as it had slipped away just before Napoleon summoned them.</t939> <t940>They lay silently.</t940> <t941>Only Boxer remained standing.</t941> <t942>He kept pacing back and forth, his tail continuously hitting his sides, occasionally neighing softly with anxiety.</t942> <t943>Finally, he said:</t943>
<t944>"I don't understand anything at all.</t944> <t945>It's unbelievable that such a thing could happen in our camp.</t945> <t946>Maybe we are also at fault.</t946> <t947>There is only one way out, and that is to work more.</t947> <t948>From now on, I will wake up an hour earlier."</t948>
<t949>Then he sadly walked back to the quarry.</t949> <t950>The little guy filled up two carts and dragged them to the construction site before going to sleep.</t950>
<t951>The group of animals huddled around Mrs. Fat but none of them spoke up.</t951> <t952>From the top of the hill, they could see the entire area.</t952> <t953>They could see almost the entire Animal Farm - the grazing fields stretching to the main road, the grass fields, the forest, the water basin, the cultivated fields with green wheat growing, and the tiled roofs of the farmhouses with winding trails of smoke.</t953> <t954>It was a spring afternoon, the sky clear and cloudless.</t954> <t955>The twilight cast a golden hue on the grass and the distant hedges.</t955> <t956>They were surprised to remember that this farm was theirs, every inch of land here was their property, every inch was so precious.</t956> <t957>Mrs. Fat looked into the distance, her eyes filled with tears.</t957> <t958>If she could express all her thoughts, she would surely say that this was not what they intended when they decided to overthrow human rule.</t958> <t959>On the night the old Leader called for their uprising, they could not have imagined the terror and mass killings of today.</t959> <t960>If she had thought about the future then, it would have been a society where animals were no longer hungry, no longer beaten, all were equal, all worked according to their ability, the strong protected the weak, just as she had protected the orphaned ducklings on the night the old Leader spoke.</t960> <t961>Yet, she could not understand why now no one dared to speak their true thoughts anymore, the fierce hunting dogs roamed everywhere, and all had to witness the killing of comrades after they confessed to heinous crimes.</t961> <t962>But in her mind, there was no thought of disobedience or rebellion.</t962> <t963>After all, they were still better off than under old Jones, and the main thing was to prevent humans from returning.</t963> <t964>No matter what, she remained loyal to the cause, continued to work tirelessly, completed all tasks, and followed the path that Napoleon had chosen.</t964> <t965>But was this really what they had longed for, what they had worked so hard to create?</t965> <t966>No, they built the windmill for a completely different purpose, the life-and-death struggle with old Jones was also to create a society completely different from what they had received today.</t966> <t967>These were the thoughts that flashed through Mrs. Fat's mind, but she could not put them into words.</t967>
<t968>Unable to find words to say, Mrs. Fat had to sing the song "Beasts of England," which was also a way to express the emotions surging in her heart.</t968> <t969>The other animals immediately sang along.</t969> <t970>They sang three times, their voices melodious, slow, and sad; they had never sung like that before.</t970>
<t971>When they had just finished singing for the third time, Chỉ Điểm, accompanied by two dogs, approached.</t971> <t972>Just by looking at them, it was clear that there was important news that needed to be urgently announced.</t972> <t973>He declared that the song "Beasts of England" had been abolished by a special decree from Comrade Napoleon.</t973> <t974>From now on, no animal was allowed to sing that song anymore.</t974>
<t975>The animals were all dumbfounded.</t975>
<t976>"Why?", Muriel asked.</t976>
<t977>"Comrades, this song is outdated," Chỉ Điểm said coldly, "The song 'Beasts of England' is a call for insurrection.</t977> <t978>The insurrection has been completely victorious.</t978> <t979>This afternoon's execution was the final battle.</t979> <t980>The enemy, both internal and external, has been defeated.</t980> <t981>The song 'Beasts of England' expresses our dream of a better society in the future.</t981> <t982>That society has been built.</t982> <t983>This song is clearly no longer necessary."</t983>
<t984>Even though they were very frightened, there would definitely have been some who stood up to protest if the sheep had not immediately chanted as usual: "Four legs good, two legs bad." They chanted for several minutes, so no one could voice any opinions anymore.</t984>
<t985>No animal sang "Beasts of England" anymore.</t985> <t986>Instead, Continuity, a newly emerged poet, had written another song, which began as follows:</t986>
<t987>This Animal Farm, This Animal Farm</t987>
<t988>The enemy will be shattered.</t988>
<t989>From then on, they always sang this song after the flag-raising ceremony on Sunday mornings.</t989> <t990>But the animals thought that both the melody and the lyrics of the new song were not as good as the previous "Beasts of England".</t990>

<t993>Chapter 8</t993>
<t994>A few days later, when the fear caused by the massacre had subsided, some of them remembered, or thought they remembered, that the Sixth Commandment said: "Animals shall not kill each other."</t994> <t995>Although they did not dare to speak up when near the dogs and pigs, they all believed that the recent killings were not in accordance with the Sixth Commandment. Mrs. Fat asked Benjamin to read the Sixth Commandment, but as always, Benjamin said he did not get involved in such matters.</t995> <t996>Mrs. Fat had to find Muriel to ask her to read it.</t996> <t997>It was written as follows: "Animals shall not kill each other without reason."</t997> <t998>It turned out they had forgotten the last few words.</t998> <t999>But this meant that the Commandment was still respected, and the traitors associated with Snowball deserved to be killed.</t999>
<t1000>This year they worked much harder than the previous year.</t1000><t1001>Besides the usual farm tasks, they also had to rebuild the windmill with walls twice as thick, and they had to complete it on schedule.</t1001><t1002>There were times when they felt they had to work more but were fed no better than during Mr. Jones's time.</t1002><t1003>Every Sunday morning, Squealer would hold a long piece of paper and read out figures proving that the production of various foodstuffs had increased, sometimes by two hundred, sometimes by three hundred, sometimes by five hundred percent.</t1003><t1004>They saw no reason to doubt it, especially since they had forgotten and no longer remembered anything from before the Rebellion.</t1004><t1005>However, sometimes they felt it would be better if the figures were lower but the food was more.</t1005>
<t1006>All orders now were issued by Squealer or another pig.</t1006> <t1007>Napoleon appeared only once every fortnight.</t1007> <t1008>Each time he appeared, he was escorted by a pack of dogs and preceded by a black rooster, like a bugler in a cavalry regiment, which always crowed "Cock-a-doodle-doo"</t1008> <t1009>loudly before Napoleon cleared his throat to begin his speech.</t1009> <t1010>It was rumored that even in the main house, Napoleon had a separate room, distinct from the other pigs.</t1010> <t1011>He ate alone, always attended by two dogs, and used porcelain dishes that had previously been kept in the drawing-room cupboard and only brought out on special occasions during Mr. Jones's time.</t1011> <t1012>There was also a new decree that from now on, the gun would be fired three times: once on Napoleon's birthday and twice on other major holidays of the farm.</t1012>
<t1013>Now they no longer address Napoleon as simply as before.</t1013> <t1014>His name always comes with titles like "Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon," and the pigs even try to invent new titles such as: Father of All Animals, Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep, Friend of the Ducks, etc.</t1014> <t1015>Whenever they speak of Napoleon's wisdom, kindness, and love as deep as the ocean for the animals, especially those still living in the dark bondage of other farms, Snowball's tears would wet his cheeks.</t1015> <t1016>All achievements were attributed to Napoleon.</t1016> <t1017>You could hear two hens confiding: "Under the leadership of Comrade Napoleon, our Leader, I have laid five eggs in the past six days"; or two cows drinking water saying: "Thanks to Comrade Napoleon's wise leadership, the water tastes so sweet these days!"</t1017> <t1018>The general sentiment of the farm was expressed in a poem titled: "Comrade Napoleon" composed by Minimus:</t1018>
<t1019>Comrade Napoleon!</t1019>
<t1020>You are the father of the orphans,</t1020>
<t1021>It is the eternal source of happiness,</t1021>
<t1022>It is the sun shining in the sky.</t1022>
<t1023>Your gaze forever warms my heart.</t1023>
<t1024>Comrade Napoleon!</t1024>
<t1025>The person who gave me a meal when I was hungry.</t1025>
<t1026>The person who gave me a warm straw mattress in the winter.</t1026>
<t1027>The person sitting guard,</t1027>
<t1028>Give the children a peaceful sleep.</t1028>
<t1029>My child!</t1029>
<t1030>Eternal happiness,</t1030>
<t1031>It's thanks to Comrade Napoleon.</t1031>
<t1032>Father's name, mother's name, husband's name,</t1032>
<t1033>You may forget.</t1033>
<t1034>But the name of the person,</t1034>
<t1035>The sun shines eternally</t1035>
<t1036>You must remember forever:</t1036>
<t1037>Napoleon, Napoleon, oh dear! 1</t1037>
<t1038>Napoleon accepted the poem and ordered it to be written on the wall of the large barn, next to the Seven Commandments. Above the poem was a portrait of Napoleon in profile, painted in white by Squealer.</t1038>
<t1039>Meanwhile, Napoleon, through the intermediary Whymper, was conducting complicated negotiations with Frederick and Pilkington.</t1039> <t1040>The pile of wood still hadn't been sold.</t1040> <t1041>Frederick was very eager to buy it, but he offered too low a price.</t1041> <t1042>At the same time, there were rumors that Frederick and his men were plotting to attack Animal Farm to destroy the windmill because he hated this place bitterly.</t1042> <t1043>It was said that Snowball was still hiding at Pinchfield Farm. By mid-summer, the animals were once again thrown into a panic when they heard rumors that three hens had confessed to being incited by Snowball to plot Napoleon's assassination.</t1043> <t1044>They were executed immediately, and stricter security measures for Napoleon were implemented.</t1044> <t1045>From now on, at night, four dogs would guard each corner of Napoleon's bed, and to avoid being poisoned, a dog named Pinkeye was assigned to taste all his food before Napoleon ate it.</t1045>
<t1046>Around that time, there was news that Napoleon had decided to sell timber to Pilkington; moreover, it was planned to establish regular product exchanges between Animal Farm and Foxwood Farm.</t1046> <t1047>The relationship between Napoleon and Pilkington, even though it was only through the intermediary Whymper, had become quite friendly.</t1047> <t1048>Pilkington, like everyone else, was never trusted by the animals, but they still preferred him over Frederick, whom they both hated and feared.</t1048> <t1049>As the end of summer approached, when the windmill was nearly completed, rumors of a treacherous attack increased.</t1049> <t1050>Some said that Frederick planned to attack with an army of twenty men fully armed and had bribed the government as well as the police to act freely.</t1050> <t1051>Additionally, news of his cruel deeds towards the animals at Pinchfield Farm was revealed.</t1051> <t1052>He beat an old horse to death, starved the cows, threw a dog into the furnace, and every evening he incited the roosters to fight each other, not just any fight, but he also tied razor blades to their spurs for extra thrill.</t1052> <t1053>When they heard that their comrades were being treated so barbarically, every animal's blood boiled with anger, and sometimes they shouted for an attack on Pinchfield Farm to drive out the humans and reclaim freedom for the animals there.</t1053> <t1054>But Squealer advised them to avoid hasty actions and to trust in Comrade Napoleon's strategic plan.</t1054>
<t1055>The hatred towards Frederick increased day by day.</t1055> <t1056>One day, on a Sunday, Napoleon appeared in the warehouse to explain to the animals that he had never thought of selling the wood to Frederick, saying that such types were not worthy of his dealings.</t1056> <t1057>The pigeons, which were still being sent to call on animals in other farms to rise up in rebellion, were forbidden from approaching Foxwood Farm, and the slogan "Death to Humanity!" was replaced with "Death to Frederick!".</t1057> <t1058>By the end of summer, another crime of Snowball was discovered.</t1058> <t1059>This time it was the wheat field full of weeds - after investigation, it was discovered that Snowball had sneaked into the farm at night and mixed weed seeds with the wheat seeds.</t1059> <t1060>A male goose, an accomplice in this affair, confessed his guilt to Squealer and then immediately swallowed a poisonous nightshade berry to commit suicide.</t1060> <t1061>The animals were also informed that, contrary to what many believed, Snowball had never been awarded the title of Animal Hero, First Class. That story was fabricated by Snowball himself right after the Battle of the Cowshed.</t1061> <t1062>Not only was he not rewarded, but he was also heavily criticized for showing cowardice during the battle.</t1062> <t1063>As always, this news confused some of the animals, but Squealer quickly convinced them that it was simply due to their poor memory.</t1063>
<t1064>The windmill was completed in the fall, right at the time of the harvest, and they had to work until they were exhausted.</t1064> <t1065>Although the equipment still needed to be installed, which Whymper was negotiating to purchase, the main thing was that the workshop was already built.</t1065> <t1066>Despite numerous difficulties, lack of technology and experience, and even sabotage by Snowball, they still managed to complete the construction on the scheduled date!</t1066> <t1067>Even though they were very tired, the animals still tried to walk around the windmill many times, full of pride, and at this moment, it looked even more beautiful than the first time it was built.</t1067> <t1068>Not to mention, the walls this time were twice as thick as before.</t1068> <t1069>Now, it would be impossible to destroy it without explosives!</t1069> <t1070>And when they thought about the amount of work done, the difficulties overcome, the changes that would come when the windmill blades started to turn, when the generator started running; when they thought about those things, all their fatigue disappeared, and they ran around the windmill together, shouting loudly. Even Napoleon, escorted by a few dogs and a rooster, came to see it, congratulated everyone on the completion of the project, and declared that the project would be named the Napoleon Mill.</t1070>
<t1071>Two days later, the animals were invited to attend a special meeting in the barn.</t1071> <t1072>They could not believe it when they heard Napoleon say that he had sold the timber to Frederick.</t1072> <t1073>Tomorrow, Frederick's truck would come to collect it. It turned out that all this time Napoleon had pretended to be friendly with Pilkington but was secretly negotiating with Frederick.</t1073>
<t1074>All relations with Foxwood Farm were cut off, and a note filled with insulting words was sent to Pilkington.</t1074> <t1075>The pigeons were ordered to avoid Pinchfield Farm and change the slogan "Death to Frederick" to "Death to Pilkington".</t1075> <t1076>At the same time, Napoleon assured the animals that the rumors about the attack on Animal Farm were completely unfounded, and that the reports of Frederick's mistreatment of livestock had been greatly exaggerated.</t1076> <t1077>It was likely that Snowball and his agents had spread these rumors.</t1077> <t1078>It turned out that Snowball not only was not hiding in Pinchfield Farm but had never been there at all; in fact, he was living quite comfortably, according to reports, in Foxwood Farm: he had sold himself to Pilkington long ago.</t1078>
<t1079>The pigs took the opportunity to elevate Napoleon to cloud nine.</t1079> <t1080>Pretending to be friendly with Pilkington, he forced Frederick to pay an extra twenty pounds.</t1080> <t1081>Squealer even said that Napoleon was an extraordinary pig because he never trusted anyone, not any animal, not even Frederick. Frederick wanted to pay by check, meaning a piece of paper specifying the amount that could be received when needed.</t1081> <t1082>But Napoleon proved to be much smarter than him.</t1082> <t1083>He demanded payment in cash, in five-pound notes, and insisted that the full amount be paid before the wood could be taken away.</t1083> <t1084>Frederick had already paid in full, and this amount was enough to buy all the equipment for the windmill.</t1084>
<t1085>The wood was transported quite quickly.</t1085> <t1086>When the wood in the yard had all been taken away, the animals were invited to a special meeting to inspect the money delivered by Frederick.</t1086> <t1087>Napoleon, wearing two medals on his chest and smiling broadly, reclined on a straw mattress, next to a porcelain dish filled with crisp new bills.</t1087> <t1088>The animals walked by one by one, freely admiring the sight.</t1088> <t1089>Boxer even sniffed at them, causing the new bills to rustle softly.</t1089>
<t1090>Three days later, a commotion occurred.</t1090> <t1091>That day, Whymper, his face as pale as someone about to die, rode his bicycle madly into the campyard, and as soon as he arrived, he threw his bike to the ground and hurriedly rushed into the main building.</t1091> <t1092>Almost immediately, a horrifying scream was heard from Napoleon's room.</t1092> <t1093>The news spread throughout the camp like wildfire.</t1093> <t1094>The money Frederick paid was all fake! He had taken the wood for free!</t1094>
<t1095>Napoleon immediately ordered a gathering and declared a death sentence for Frederick. That guy deserves to be burned alive - he said so.</t1095> <t1096>At the same time, he also stated that everyone must be prepared to deal with the worst situations.</t1096> <t1097>Frederick and his men could attack at any moment.</t1097> <t1098>Guards must be stationed on every road leading into the camp.</t1098> <t1099>Additionally, he sent four pigeons carrying messages of goodwill to Foxwood Farm in hopes of normalizing relations.</t1099>
<t1100>Early the next morning, Frederick organized an attack.</t1100> <t1101>The animals were preparing to have breakfast when the guard ran in to report that Frederick and his men had crossed the main gate of the farm.</t1101> <t1102>Without hesitation, the animals immediately charged, but this time they had to fight much harder than in the Battle of the Cowshed.</t1102> <t1103>There were fifteen men with about half a dozen guns, and they started shooting from more than a hundred meters away.</t1103> <t1104>The gunfire was deafening, and the bullets sprayed like chaff; the animals did not expect the battle to be so fierce, so despite Napoleon and Boxer’s efforts to motivate them, they gradually retreated.</t1104> <t1105>Some of the animals were injured.</t1105> <t1106>They ran into the buildings and peered through the holes in the walls.</t1106> <t1107>The entire large pasture, including the windmill, had fallen into the hands of the enemy.</t1107> <t1108>Even Napoleon appeared confused.</t1108> <t1109>He paced silently, his twisted tail flicking from side to side.</t1109> <t1110>Occasionally, he looked towards Foxwood Farm. If Pilkington brought reinforcements, they might be able to drive the enemy away.</t1110> <t1111>But at that moment, the four pigeons sent out the day before returned.</t1111> <t1112>One of them held a piece of paper with the words "Serves you right."</t1112>
<t1113>Meanwhile, Frederick and his men had approached the windmill.</t1113> <t1114>The animals watched intently, and anxious whispers began to rise.</t1114> <t1115>Two men were carrying hammers and crowbars.</t1115> <t1116>They were probably planning to destroy the windmill.</t1116>
<t1117>"It's not going to work!", Napoleon shouted, "The windmill walls are very thick, they can't do anything.</t1117> <t1118>It will take at least a week.</t1118> <t1119>Stay calm, comrades!"</t1119>
<t1120>But Benjamin did not take his eyes off all the movements.</t1120> <t1121>The two men were using hammers and crowbars to dig a hole right at the foot of the windmill wall.</t1121> <t1122>Benjamin nodded his long snout, seemingly finding it interesting.</t1122>
<t1123>"I still think so, it said, do you know what they are doing?</t1123> <t1124>They are going to put explosives in the hole."</t1124>
<t1125>The animals waited in fear.</t1125> <t1126>None of them dared to risk rushing out.</t1126> <t1127>Then they saw the humans scattering in all directions.</t1127> <t1128>A deafening explosion rang out.</t1128> <t1129>The pigeons shot up into the air, while the other animals, except Napoleon, quickly lay flat on the ground, faces pressed to the earth.</t1129> <t1130>When they lifted their heads, they saw a cloud of black smoke still covering the area of the windmill.</t1130> <t1131>The smoke gradually cleared.</t1131> <t1132>The windmill had been completely destroyed!</t1132>
<t1133>The scene immediately awakened the animals.</t1133> <t1134>The cruel and wicked actions made them extremely angry.</t1134> <t1135>Without any orders, they simultaneously charged forward, rushing straight at the enemy, roaring with cries of hatred demanding revenge.</t1135> <t1136>Even the buckshot raining down on their backs did not make them falter.</t1136> <t1137>They were ready to sacrifice everything.</t1137> <t1138>Frederick and his men fired continuously, and when the animals got close, they used sticks to hit and kicked them.</t1138> <t1139>One cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, almost all of them were injured.</t1139> <t1140>Napoleon, commanding from behind, was also shot in the tail.</t1140> <t1141>But some of Frederick's men were also bruised and battered.</t1141> <t1142>Three men had their heads smashed by Boxer, one was gored in the belly by a cow, and another had his pants torn by a dog bite.</t1142> <t1143>When the nine dogs of Napoleon's guard were ordered to flank and attack while barking, the humans panicked.</t1143> <t1144>They realized they were about to be surrounded.</t1144> <t1145>Frederick ordered a retreat, and the enemy fled in panic.</t1145> <t1146>The animals chased them all the way to the border and continued to butt them in the rear as they crawled through the fence separating the two farms.</t1146>
<t1147>They had won, but they were also exhausted from fatigue and injuries.</t1147><t1148>They slowly returned to the farm.</t1148><t1149>The sight of their comrades' sacrifice moved them to tears.</t1149><t1150>They stood silently beside the rubble of the windmill.</t1150><t1151>The windmill was gone, all their efforts erased!</t1151><t1152>Even the foundation was almost completely destroyed.</t1152><t1153>Last time, when rebuilding, they could still use the old stones.</t1153><t1154>Now, even the stones were gone.</t1154><t1155>The explosion had scattered the stones everywhere, as far as a hundred meters away.</t1155>
<t1156>When they were nearing the farm, Chỉ Điểm, whom none of them had seen during the battle, suddenly appeared from somewhere, wagging its tail vigorously, looking very pleased.</t1156> <t1157>The animals heard the sound of gunfire.</t1157>
<t1158>"Why are they shooting?", Chiến Sĩ asked</t1158>
<t1159>"To celebrate the victory," Chỉ Điểm shouted.</t1159>
<t1160>"Which victory?" the Warrior said again.</t1160> <t1161>Its knees were all torn, the iron claws were loose, its feet were injured, and its hind legs were still embedded with dozens of shrapnel pieces.</t1161>
<t1162>"What victory, comrades? Did we not just liberate the land, the sacred land of our Animal Farm?"</t1162>
<t1163>"But they have knocked down the windmill, two years of construction is not a small thing!"</t1163>
<t1164>"So what?</t1164> <t1165>We will build another one.</t1165> <t1166>If we want, we can build six at once.</t1166> <t1167>Perhaps you have not fully appreciated the great victory we just achieved.</t1167> <t1168>The enemy had taken the very land we are standing on now.</t1168> <t1169>Now, thanks to Comrade Napoleon's leadership, we have reclaimed every inch of our land."</t1169>
<t1170>"We are reclaiming our own land," the Warrior said.</t1170>
<t1171>"That's exactly the victory, isn't it?" Chỉ Điểm said.</t1171>
<t1172>Finally, they managed to drag themselves back to the campyard.</t1172> <t1173>The shrapnel still embedded in Chiến Sĩ's leg throbbed unbearably.</t1173> <t1174>He had already envisioned the hardships and toil of rebuilding the windmill from scratch and was mentally prepared to dive into the work.</t1174> <t1175>But this was also the first time he realized that he was already eleven years old, and his strength was not what it used to be.</t1175>
<t1176>But when they saw the green flag flying, heard the salvo of gunfire—seven volleys that day—and especially after hearing Napoleon's thanks for their brave fighting, they truly felt they had achieved a great victory.</t1176> <t1177>The fallen were buried with care.</t1177> <t1178>The funeral procession was led by Napoleon himself, followed by a two-horse carriage used as a hearse, pulled by Warrior and Fatty.</t1178> <t1179>They took two days off to celebrate the victory.</t1179> <t1180>They organized singing, gave speeches, and fired guns; each livestock animal received an apple, each poultry animal received sixty grams of grain, and each dog received three biscuits.</t1180> <t1181>It was then announced that this battle would be called the Windmill Campaign, and Napoleon decided to establish a new title called the "Green Flag Medal," which he awarded to himself.</t1181> <t1182>In that overwhelming collective joy, none of them thought about the counterfeit money incident anymore.</t1182>
<t1183>A few days later, the pigs discovered a barrel of whisky in the basement of the main house.</t1183> <t1184>That afternoon, the other animals suddenly heard singing coming from the main house, and what surprised them even more was that there were parts of the song "Beasts of England".</t1184> <t1185>Then, at around half-past nine, while it was still light, they saw Napoleon emerge from the back door, wearing Mr. Jones's old bowler hat, trotting around the yard once before going back inside.</t1185> <t1186>The next morning, a silence enveloped the entire main house.</t1186> <t1187>Not a single pig or any movement was seen around the house.</t1187> <t1188>It wasn't until around nine o'clock that Squealer appeared, his eyes looking glazed, tail drooping, and legs moving sluggishly, clearly very tired.</t1188> <t1189>He called everyone together and said there was an important announcement to make.</t1189> <t1190>Comrade Napoleon is dying!</t1190>
<t1191>The cries and wails rose up.</t1191> <t1192>They hurriedly brought straw to spread in front of the main house's door, none of them dared to step heavily.</t1192> <t1193>Tears welling up, they whispered to each other about what they would do if the leader were to meet any misfortune.</t1193> <t1194>There were rumors that Snowball had poisoned Napoleon.</t1194> <t1195>At eleven o'clock, Squealer appeared again.</t1195> <t1196>Squealer said that before departing from this world, comrade Napoleon had signed a decree that from now on, any animal that drinks alcohol would be sentenced to death.</t1196>
<t1197>By the afternoon, there was news that Napoleon had improved, and the next morning, Chỉ Điểm announced that the leader was recovering.</t1197> <t1198>That afternoon, Napoleon had gotten up to work, and the next morning, there was news that he had ordered Whymper to buy some books on brewing beer and wine in Willingdon.</t1198> <t1199>A week later, Napoleon ordered the plowing of the land that had previously been intended as a pasture for the retired animals.</t1199> <t1200>The animals were told that the land was too barren and needed to be cultivated for a while to regain its fertility, but it later became clear that Napoleon intended to plant barley there.</t1200>
<t1201>Around this time, an event occurred that almost none of the animals understood.</t1201> <t1202>That night, it was nearly midnight when a loud noise echoed from the yard, causing everyone to rush out of their pens.</t1202> <t1203>The moon was very bright that night, and they all saw near the gable end of the large barn, where the "Seven Commandments" were inscribed, a ladder broken in two.</t1203> <t1204>Nearby was Squealer, who was unconscious at the time, with a hurricane lamp and a can of white paint lying beside him.</t1204> <t1205>The dogs immediately formed a circle around Squealer and helped him back to the main house as he struggled to get up.</t1205> <t1206>It seemed that apart from Benjamin, none of the animals understood what had happened, but he just shook his head and said nothing.</t1206>
<t1207>A few days later, Muriel, while rereading the Seven Commandments, discovered that they had misremembered another one.</t1207> <t1208>They thought that the Fifth Commandment was "No animal shall drink alcohol," but they had forgotten three words.</t1208> <t1209>In fact, the Commandment was: "No animal shall drink alcohol to excess."</t1209>

<t1211>Animal Farm</t1211>
<t1212>Chapter 9</t1212>
<t1213>The injured hoof of Warrior took a long time to heal.</t1213> <t1214>Meanwhile, the animals proceeded to restore the windmill right after the victory celebration.</t1214> <t1215>Warrior did not take a single day off, and it was very proud that it did not let the others see it was in pain.</t1215> <t1216>Only in the evening did it tell Fatty that the wound was tormenting it.</t1216> <t1217>Fatty had to chew leaves and apply them to Warrior's wound. She, along with Benjamin, persuaded Warrior to take care of itself.</t1217>
<t1218>"A horse's lungs are not very strong," it said.</t1218>
<t1219>But Chiến Sĩ did not listen.</t1219> <t1220>He said that he had only one wish, which was to see the windmill completed before he retired.</t1220>
<t1221>Right from the establishment of the Animal Farm's rules, it was stipulated that the retirement age for horses and pigs is twelve, for cows is fourteen, for dogs is nine, for sheep is seven, and for chickens is five.</t1221> <t1222>They also agreed that those who retire would not lack anything.</t1222> <t1223>In fact, until now, no animal has retired yet, but recently this issue has been frequently discussed.</t1223> <t1224>Now, with the plot of land next to the garden being used to grow barley, there is news that a corner of the long pasture will be fenced off for the elderly animals.</t1224> <t1225>There is also news that retired horses will receive two pounds of grain per day in the summer, and seven pounds of hay in the winter, with an additional carrot or apple on holidays.</t1225> <t1226>Next year, Boxer will turn twelve years old.</t1226>
<t1227>Currently, their lives must be said to be quite difficult.</t1227> <t1228>This winter is as cold as last year, but food is even scarcer.</t1228> <t1229>Rations, except for dogs and pigs, have all been reduced.</t1229> <t1230>Absolute equality, Squealer explained, is contrary to the principles of Animalism. He easily proved to the others that they actually had enough food, and that the food shortage was merely an illusion.</t1230> <t1231>Of course, certain adjustments were necessary at this time (Squealer said "adjustments" rather than "reductions"), but compared to the days of old Jones, the improvement was clear.</t1231> <t1232>In a rapid, shrill voice, he presented very specific figures, proving that they harvested more oats, more hay, more turnips than in Jones's time, the work was lighter, the water quality was better, they lived longer, the infant survival rate was higher, they had more straw for bedding, and fewer lice.</t1232> <t1233>All the animals believed this.</t1233> <t1234>In fact, they had almost forgotten all about the days of Mr. Jones.</t1234> <t1235>They only knew that life now was very hard, arduous, they were often hungry, cold, and as soon as they opened their eyes, they had to work.</t1235> <t1236>It must have been even harder before.</t1236> <t1237>They were happy to believe this.</t1237> <t1238>Moreover, more importantly, they were slaves before, but now they were free, Squealer always emphasized this.</t1238>
<t1239>The population is increasing day by day.</t1239> <t1240>Last autumn, four sows farrowed at the same time, giving birth to a total of thirty-one piglets.</t1240> <t1241>All of them were spotted pigs, and since Napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was easy to guess whose offspring they were.</t1241> <t1242>The entire farm was informed that bricks and wood were being purchased, and once acquired, a schoolhouse would be built.</t1242> <t1243>In the meantime, the piglets would be taught by Napoleon in the kitchen area.</t1243> <t1244>The piglets were allowed to play in the garden but were forbidden to interact with other species' young.</t1244> <t1245>A new rule was also introduced around this time, stating that everyone must step aside to give way to pigs, and additionally, pigs, regardless of rank, were to wear a green ribbon on their tails on Sundays.</t1245>
<t1246>This year has been quite successful, but money is still lacking.</t1246><t1247>We still have to buy bricks, lime, and sand to build the school; and we also have to save up to buy machinery for the windmill.</t1247><t1248>Then we need to buy oil for lamps, candles, and sugar for Napoleon alone (he forbids the other pigs from eating sugar for fear they will gain weight) and many other things like tools, nails, ropes, coal, wire, roofing sheets, and biscuits for the dogs.</t1248><t1249>We have to sell some hay and potatoes, the contract to sell eggs has increased to six hundred eggs per week, so the number of chickens has almost not increased, if not decreased, because the number of eggs they leave for hatching is too few.</t1249><t1250>In December, the rations were reduced once, in February they were reduced again, and to save money, from now on, no lights are allowed to be lit in the barns at night.</t1250><t1251>But the pigs seem to be living well, at least each one has gained weight.</t1251><t1252>Once, on a February afternoon, a strong fragrance suddenly filled the farmyard, a smell the animals had never encountered before.</t1252><t1253>It turned out the smell came from the house behind the kitchen, which in Jones's time was used for brewing beer, but had been abandoned for a long time.</t1253><t1254>Someone said it was the smell of brewing barley.</t1254><t1255>The animals sniffed the strong, spicy aroma and tried to guess if they would get to eat the "mash" that night.</t1255><t1256>But that night there was no "mash", and on Sunday they were informed that from now on the barley would be reserved exclusively for the pigs.</t1256><t1257>The plot of land next to the garden had already been sown with barley.</t1257><t1258>Then there was news that from now on each pig would get half a liter of beer a day, while Napoleon would get two liters, and he had to drink it from a crystal goblet.</t1258>
<t1259>Although there are still many difficulties, life is much more worth living than before.</t1259> <t1260>Never before have they been able to sing, listen to talks, attend rallies, and protest as much as they do now.</t1260> <t1261>Napoleon ordered that there must be a Parade every week, which he called Spontaneous, with the purpose of praising the struggle and achievements of Animal Farm.</t1261> <t1262>At the designated time, everyone would immediately leave their work, form ranks, starting with the pigs, followed by the horses, cows, sheep, and finally the chickens and ducks, and march around the farm.</t1262> <t1263>Napoleon's black rooster always led the way, while the dogs flanked the parade.</t1263> <t1264>Warrior and Fat Lady carried the green flag with the horn and hoof emblem and the slogan "Long live Comrade Napoleon."</t1264> <t1265>The rallies always ended with the recitation of a poem praising Napoleon and a report from the Pointer on the achievements in production increases over the past period; celebrations often included gun salutes as well.</t1265> <t1266>The sheep particularly enjoyed the parades, and if any of them complained (especially when the dogs and pigs were absent) that the parades were just cold and a waste of time, they would immediately chant their eternal prayer: "Four legs good, two legs bad," so loudly that it drowned out all (even any) complaints and grumbles.</t1266> <t1267>But generally, the majority liked such ceremonies.</t1267> <t1268>They felt somewhat comforted because such gatherings reminded them that they were truly the owners of the farm and everything they did was for themselves alone.</t1268> <t1269>The songs, the parades, the Pointer's statistics, the gun salutes, the rooster's crowing, and the flag fluttering in the wind helped them forget, even if just for a moment, the gnawing hunger that tormented them.</t1269>
<t1270>In April, Animal Farm declared itself a Republic, necessitating the election of a President.</t1270> <t1271>There was only one candidate.</t1271> <t1272>Napoleon was elected with one hundred percent of the vote.</t1272> <t1273>That very day, news came that new documents had been found proving that Snowball had been collaborating with Mr. Jones from the beginning.</t1273> <t1274>It turned out that Snowball not only used clever tactics to sabotage the Battle of the Cowshed, as previously thought, but had also fully sided with Mr. Jones.</t1274> <t1275>Snowball had led the human invasion, shouting loudly: "Long live humanity!".</t1275> <t1276>As for the wounds on his back, some animals still alive had seen those wounds and remembered clearly that they were indeed Napoleon's bite marks.</t1276>
<t1277>After many years of absence, Moses suddenly reappeared in the middle of last summer.</t1277> <t1278>He had hardly changed, still refusing to do anything and spending all day telling fanciful stories about Sugarcandy Mountain. He often perched on a tree branch, flapping his black wings and talking for hours on end, as long as there was someone willing to listen.</t1278>
<t1279>"Up there, comrades," It said while pointing its beak towards the sky, "above those black clouds is Mount Rice, where we, the wretched animals, will rest forever."</t1279>
<t1280>It also said that it had once flown there, had seen clover fields lush all year round, and had seen gardens full of flaxseed cakes and sugar cubes.</t1280> <t1281>Yet there were many hostages.</t1281> <t1282>They thought they were starving, suffering, and struggling; so the idea of a more peaceful world somewhere else seemed only fair.</t1282> <t1283>But what they couldn't understand was the pigs' attitude towards Moses.</t1283> <t1284>The pigs scorned the idea that Sugar Mountain was just a fabrication, but Moses was not only not driven away but was also given a pint of beer each day.</t1284>
<t1285>Finally, Warrior's hoof healed, and it threw itself into work more enthusiastically than ever.</t1285> <t1286>The other animals also had to work no differently than hard labor prisoners.</t1286> <t1287>Besides the regular farm tasks and restoring the windmill, there was also the job of building a school for the piglets.</t1287> <t1288>The school construction began in March.</t1288> <t1289>Sometimes it seemed impossible to endure the time and intensity of the labor with an empty stomach, but Warrior never lost heart.</t1289> <t1290>There was no sign, either in words or actions, that its strength was not what it used to be.</t1290> <t1291>However, its appearance had changed a bit; its skin was no longer as glossy, and its hips looked smaller.</t1291> <t1292>Everyone said, "With fresh grass, Warrior will recover immediately," but spring had come, the grass was green, and Warrior hadn't gained any weight.</t1292> <t1293>When watching it strain to pull stones up the slope, it seemed as if its strength was exhausted, and only a steely will kept it standing.</t1293> <t1294>Looking at its lips, a keen observer could see it was trying to say, "I will try harder," but it couldn't utter the words.</t1294> <t1295>Mrs. Fat and Benjamin reminded it to take care of its health, but it ignored them.</t1295> <t1296>Its twelfth birthday was approaching.</t1296> <t1297>It only cared about one thing: gathering as many stones as possible before retiring, and whatever happened after that didn't matter.</t1297>
<t1298>One night, when it was already quite late, there was suddenly news that Chiến Sĩ had met with an accident.</t1298> <t1299>It turned out that he had gone to pull the stone cart alone.</t1299> <t1300>It was no longer a rumor, it was the truth; a few minutes later, two pigeons flew back.</t1300>
<t1301>"The Warrior has fallen! It fell and is lying on its side, it can't get up anymore!", the two pigeons reported.</t1301>
<t1302>Almost half of the animals on the farm rushed towards the mound.</t1302> <t1303>Warrior lay there, between the two cart shafts, his neck stretched out, but too weak to lift his head.</t1303> <t1304>His back was drenched in sweat, and his eyes looked wild.</t1304> <t1305>A small stream of blood was oozing from his mouth.</t1305> <t1306>Fat Lady knelt down beside him.</t1306>
<t1307>"Warrior!", it asked, "What happened to you?"</t1307>
<t1308>"I can't breathe anymore," Soldier whispered, "But it's okay.</t1308> <t1309>I think you all will be able to rebuild the windmill.</t1309> <t1310>There are plenty of stones already.</t1310> <t1311>Anyway, it's only one more month until I retire.</t1311> <t1312>To be honest, I'm really looking forward to retirement.</t1312> <t1313>Benjamin is old too, if he could retire at the same time as me to keep me company, that would be wonderful."</t1313>
<t1314>"Go inform Chỉ Điểm immediately," Mrs. Mập said.</t1314>
<t1315>Everyone immediately ran to the main house to find Chỉ Điểm.</t1315> <t1316>Only Bà Mập and Benjamin stayed behind.</t1316> <t1317>Benjamin quietly lay down next to Chiến Sĩ and used his tail to swat flies away from him.</t1317> <t1318>About fifteen minutes later, Chỉ Điểm arrived, his face showing full of sympathy and eagerness.</t1318> <t1319>He said that comrade Napoleon was very sad to hear that an accident had happened to one of the farm's most loyal workers and was arranging to take Chiến Sĩ to be treated at the hospital in Willingdon.</t1319> <t1320>But the animals felt uneasy because, until now, apart from Mollie and Tuyết Tròn, no one had ever left the farm, and they also didn't like the idea of handing over a sick comrade to humans.</t1320> <t1321>However, Chỉ Điểm easily convinced them that the veterinarians in Willingdon would treat Chiến Sĩ better than just letting him lie in the farm.</t1321> <t1322>About half an hour later, Chiến Sĩ managed to stand up and slowly made his way back to the barn.</t1322> <t1323>Bà Mập and Benjamin spread straw to make him a rather thick bed.</t1323>
<t1324>The Warrior lay in the pen for two consecutive days.</t1324> <t1325>The pigs found a rather large bottle of pink medicine in the medicine cabinet in the bathroom and brought it to him.</t1325> <t1326>Mrs. Fat made him take it twice a day, right after meals.</t1326> <t1327>In the evening, Mrs. Fat went into the Warrior's pen to chat, while Benjamin shooed away the flies for him.</t1327> <t1328>The Warrior said he had nothing to complain about.</t1328> <t1329>If he recovered this time, he could live for another three years, and he hoped to spend his remaining peaceful days in the corner of the large meadow reserved for retirees.</t1329> <t1330>He would devote all his free time to studying and improving his skills.</t1330> <t1331>He said he would spend the rest of his life learning to master the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.</t1331>
<t1332>Benjamin and Mrs. Fat could only take care of Warrior after working hours, yet the vehicle to take him away appeared around noon.</t1332> <t1333>The pigs were commanding the group to sow mustard seeds in the field when suddenly they saw Benjamin galloping from the farm, shouting until his voice was hoarse.</t1333> <t1334>This was the first time they had seen Benjamin so emotional, and also the first time they had seen him gallop.</t1334>
<t1335>"Hurry up! Hurry up!", he screamed, "Come here quickly! They have taken the Warrior away!"</t1335>
<t1336>The whole group immediately dropped what they were doing and ran towards the main house, not waiting for the pigs' permission.</t1336> <t1337>Indeed, in the yard, there was a closed two-horse carriage, with large letters written on its side, and the coachman wore a fedora that made him look quite cunning.</t1337> <t1338>Warrior was no longer in the pen.</t1338>
<t1339>The animals gathered around the vehicle.</t1339>
<t1340>"Travel safely, Warrior!", They shouted in unison, "Goodbye!"</t1340>
<t1341>"Stupid, so stupid," Benjamin screamed while running around, his feet thudding on the ground, "Stupid, can't you see any letters?"</t1341>
<t1342>The whole group seemed to awaken, silently looking at each other.</t1342> <t1343>The donkey Muriel began to spell out, but Benjamin pushed her aside and read:</t1343>
<t1344>"Alfred Simmond's slaughterhouse, Willingdon.</t1344> <t1345>Buying and selling meat, bones, horse hides.</t1345> <t1346>Providing dog kennels.</t1346> <t1347>Do you understand?</t1347> <t1348>They are taking Warrior to be slaughtered!"</t1348>
<t1349>A terrifying scream erupted from every chest.</t1349> <t1350>At that moment, the coachman cracked his whip, and the two horses began to trot.</t1350> <t1351>The carriage slowly moved out of the yard.</t1351> <t1352>The whole group ran after it, crying like a storm.</t1352> <t1353>Fat Lady rushed forward. The carriage also sped up.</t1353> <t1354>Fat Lady tried to leap forward, but she was exhausted and couldn't keep up with the other two.</t1354>
<t1355>"Warrior!", he screamed, "Warrior! Warrior! Warrior!"</t1355>
<t1356>It is unknown whether Chiến Sĩ heard the call from outside or not, but its snout with a white streak running along its nose was peeking inside the small window at the back of the vehicle.</t1356>
<t1357>"Warrior!", Mrs. Fat shouted until her voice was hoarse, "Run! Run! Run quickly! They will kill you!"</t1357>
<t1358>Everyone shouted in unison:</t1358>
<t1359>"Run, Warrior, Run!"</t1359>
<t1360>But the two horses had increased their speed, and the cart was getting farther away.</t1360> <t1361>It was unclear whether Chiến Sĩ had heard what Bà Mập said or not, but his muzzle was no longer visible inside the window, and at the same time, one could hear his paws hitting the side of the cart rhythmically and loudly, much like the sound of a drum.</t1361> <t1362>That was Chiến Sĩ kicking the side of the cart to find a way out.</t1362> <t1363>In the past, just a few kicks like that would have been enough to turn this cart into firewood.</t1363> <t1364>But oh my God! His strength was gone now, and the sound of his kicks grew fainter and fainter until it stopped completely.</t1364> <t1365>Not knowing what else to do, the animals turned to the two pulling horses for help, begging them to stop running.</t1365>
<t1366>"Comrades! Comrades!", They shouted in unison again, "Do you know where you are taking your brother?"</t1366>
<t1367>But the two dim-witted animals did not understand; they only perked up their ears slightly and ran even faster.</t1367> <t1368>Warrior was no longer visible through the small window.</t1368> <t1369>Some thought about running out to close the large gate, but it was too late; the vehicle had already reached the main road and was getting farther away.</t1369> <t1370>From then on, no one saw Warrior again.</t1370>
<t1371>Three days later, there was an announcement that Warrior had passed away at the hospital in Willingdon, despite receiving very attentive care.</t1371> <t1372>It was Squealer who made the announcement.</t1372> <t1373>He also said that he had been by Warrior's side during his final moments.</t1373>
<t1374>"It was incredibly moving," Chỉ Điểm said while wiping away tears, "I sat beside Chiến Sĩ as he took his last breath.</t1374> <t1375>Before he died, he was very weak, unable to speak, but he still tried to whisper that he regretted not being able to attend the windmill's inauguration.</t1375> <t1376>"Forward, comrades - he said - For the cause of the Rebellion, march forward! Long live Animal Farm! Long live Comrade Napoleon! Comrade Napoleon is always right!" - Those were his last words."</t1376>
<t1377>At that moment, Chỉ Điểm's attitude suddenly changed.</t1377> <t1378>He sat still for a while, then looked around before continuing the story.</t1378>
<t1379>It said that since Chiến Sỹ was taken away, unfounded rumors had been spreading in the camp.</t1379> <t1380>Some animals, upon seeing the words "Slaughterhouse" on the side of the truck, hastily concluded that Chiến Sỹ was taken away to be slaughtered.</t1380> <t1381>Chỉ Điểm said that it couldn't believe that the animals in the camp were that foolish.</t1381> <t1382>Unbelievable, Chỉ Điểm said while wagging its tail and jumping around, that the animals in the camp could think of their beloved leader, think of comrade Napoleon in such a way!</t1382> <t1383>Things were much simpler.</t1383> <t1384>The fact was that the veterinarian had bought the truck from the slaughterhouse, but he hadn't had the chance to remove the old owner's name yet.</t1384> <t1385>That was the only reason.</t1385>
<t1386>Hearing that, everyone felt reassured.</t1386> <t1387>And when Chỉ Điểm vividly described the care, as well as the expensive medicines that Napoleon ordered to treat Chiến Sĩ in his final days, all the long-standing doubts were completely dispelled, and the sorrow of losing a friend was greatly alleviated: after all, Chiến Sĩ had received a proper burial.</t1387>
<t1388>Napoleon himself attended the meeting on Sunday morning and delivered a speech commemorating the Warrior. We are not in a position, he said, to bring the remains of the fallen comrade back to the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made, with flowers taken directly from the farm's garden, and sent to Willingdon to be placed on the Warrior's grave. The pigs will organize a grand forty-nine-day ceremony [1] for the Warrior, he promised.</t1388> <t1389>Napoleon concluded his speech by reiterating the Warrior's two slogans: "I will work harder" and "Comrade Napoleon is always right."</t1389> <t1390>Napoleon also said that all the animals on the farm should emulate the Warrior, adopting his slogans as their own guiding principles.</t1390>
<t1391>On the exact day of the forty-nine-day ceremony for Chiến Sỹ, a truck carrying a large wooden crate arrived at the main building.</t1391> <t1392>That evening, sounds of singing and loud arguments emanated from the building, and at eleven o'clock, the sound of glass breaking was heard, followed by complete silence.</t1392> <t1393>The main building remained tightly shut until noon the next day, during which time rumors spread that the pigs had made money and bought an entire crate of whiskey.</t1393>
<t1394>George Orwell</t1394>
<t1395>Animal Farm</t1395>
<t1396>Chapter 10</t1396>
<t1397>Many years have passed.</t1397> <t1398>Spring goes, winter comes, the life of animals is like a fleeting shadow through the window.</t1398> <t1399>Only Benjamin, Mrs. Fat, the raven Moses, and a few pigs still remember the "old days," before the Rebellion.</t1399>
<t1400>Muriel is dead.</t1400> <t1401>Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher are also gone.</t1401> <t1402>Mr. Jones is also dead, having died in an inebriates' home.</t1402> <t1403>No one mentions Snowball anymore.</t1403> <t1404>Only a few animals remember Boxer. Clover has become a fat, old horse, slow of foot and dim of eye.</t1404> <t1405>She has been past retirement age for two years, but in reality, no animal has ever retired.</t1405> <t1406>No one talks about setting aside a piece of land for the old animals anymore.</t1406> <t1407>Napoleon has become a huge boar, weighing at least a ton and a half.</t1407> <t1408>Squealer is also very fat, his eyes nearly closed, almost unable to see.</t1408> <t1409>Only Benjamin is still the same, though his muzzle is white, and since Boxer's death, he has become more morose and taciturn.</t1409>
<t1410>Animal Farm had many new members, though not as many as they initially thought.</t1410> <t1411>Some were born right there, for whom the Rebellion was just a vague tradition, passed down orally.</t1411> <t1412>Some were bought from elsewhere, and these had never heard anyone talk about it before arriving here.</t1412> <t1413>Besides the Fat Lady, the farm also had three more horses.</t1413> <t1414>They were large, strong, hardworking, kind-hearted but very stupid.</t1414> <t1415>None of them knew more than the letter B.</t1415> <t1416>They had absolute faith in the Animalism and the stories about the Rebellion, especially those told by the Fat Lady, whom they regarded as a mother; but it seemed they didn't understand anything at all.</t1416>
<t1417>The farm was well-organized and increasingly prosperous; they even expanded by purchasing two more plots of land from Pilkington.</t1417> <t1418>The windmill was completed, they bought a threshing machine, a hoist, and built many more buildings.</t1418> <t1419>Whymper also bought himself a small cart.</t1419> <t1420>They did not install a generator on the windmill but used it for milling, which earned them a lot of money.</t1420> <t1421>They were building another windmill, where they said they would install a generator.</t1421> <t1422>But luxuries like electric lights, hot water, and a three-day work week, which they once dreamed of during Snowball's time, were no longer mentioned.</t1422> <t1423>Napoleon had declared that such ideas were completely contrary to the spirit of Animalism. True happiness, he said, was hard work and living frugally and thriftily.</t1423>
<t1424>The farm became wealthier, but except for the pigs and dogs, the lives of the other animals remained the same as before.</t1424> <t1425>It might also be partly because there were too many pigs and dogs.</t1425> <t1426>They did work, of course, in their own way.</t1426> <t1427>Squealer tirelessly explained that organizing and supervising the farm's work were tasks that had to be done regularly and continuously.</t1427> <t1428>And other species couldn't handle it; this job required a lot of intelligence.</t1428> <t1429>For example, Squealer said that the pigs spent a lot of effort drafting what they called "documents," "data," "reports," "minutes," and "memos."</t1429> <t1430>These were large sheets of paper filled with writing, and after they were written, they were taken to the furnace to be burned.</t1430> <t1431>Thanks to this, the farm became as prosperous as it is today, Squealer often said.</t1431> <t1432>Anyway, those things couldn't fill the pigs' and dogs' bellies, and they were very gluttonous.</t1432>
<t1433>The lives of the other animals remained the same as before.</t1433> <t1434>During the day, they were often hungry, at night they slept on straw beds, drank water directly from the pond, worked in the open fields, suffered from sleeplessness due to the cold in winter, and were tormented by flies in the summer.</t1434> <t1435>Occasionally, the older animals tried to recall whether their lives were better now compared to just after the Rebellion, when they had just driven Mr. Jones away.</t1435> <t1436>But they could not remember.</t1436> <t1437>They had nothing to compare with: their minds were filled only with Squealer's statistics, numbers that always proved that everything was improving, getting better step by step every day.</t1437> <t1438>So they accepted it and besides, they didn't have much time to think about such things.</t1438> <t1439>Only old Benjamin asserted that he remembered everything, down to the smallest detail of what had happened, and knew clearly that they had never been worse off nor better off, it was always hunger, working tirelessly, and being deceived; such was the law of life, he often said.</t1439>
<t1440>Anyway, they still kept hoping.</t1440> <t1441>Moreover, they were always proud to be citizens of Animal Farm.</t1441> <t1442>In this country, which is indeed England, this is the only farm run by animals and managed by animals! All the animals, from the smallest ones to those newly bought from tens of kilometers away, were proud of this.</t1442> <t1443>Especially when they heard the sound of gunfire, when they saw the green flag flying, their hearts would beat excitedly, and at that moment, no matter what they were talking about, they would return to the topic of those glorious years, about overthrowing Mr. Jones, about establishing the Seven Commandments, and about the heroic battles against the invading humans.</t1443> <t1444>They also did not forget to remind each other of the initial expectations.</t1444> <t1445>They believed that the prophecy of the old Leader about the day of establishing the Animal Republic across the entire territory of England, the day when humans would be expelled from this land, would definitely come.</t1445> <t1446>Their dreams would come true, that day would definitely come, even if it was far away, even if all the animals currently living would not witness it, but that day would definitely come.</t1446> <t1447>They also did not forget the song "Beasts of England," every animal knew how to sing this song, but they only dared to sing it quietly to each other.</t1447> <t1448>Even though life was still difficult, even though not all of their dreams were realized, deep down they knew that they were special animals.</t1448> <t1449>Even though they were not yet full, they did not have to work to feed the cruel humans; even though they still had to labor hard, it was for themselves.</t1449> <t1450>No animal walked on two legs, there was no master-servant relationship. All were equal.</t1450>
<t1451>One day, at the beginning of summer, Chỉ Điểm suddenly ordered the flock of sheep to follow it to the abandoned field outside the farm, where there was a whole forest of young birch trees.</t1451> <t1452>The flock of sheep stayed there all day, freely chewing on the leaves, of course under the direction of Chỉ Điểm.</t1452> <t1453>That evening, Chỉ Điểm returned to the farm alone, as the weather was good that day, it told the flock of sheep to sleep right outside in the field to stay cool.</t1453> <t1454>They stayed there for an entire week.</t1454> <t1455>Every day, Chỉ Điểm went out to the flock of sheep.</t1455> <t1456>According to what it said, it was teaching the flock of sheep a new song, and it was easier to learn in the quiet.</t1456>
<t1457>One afternoon, the sheep had finished their lessons and returned, while the whole group was heading back after a day of labor when they suddenly heard a horse's frantic neigh coming from the direction of the farm.</t1457> <t1458>Terrified, they all immediately stood as if rooted to the spot.</t1458> <t1459>It was the cry of Fat Lady. She cried out again, and they all immediately dashed into the farmyard to see what was happening.</t1459> <t1460>And they saw exactly what had caused Fat Lady's panic.</t1460>
<t1461>That is a pig walking on its two hind legs.</t1461>
<t1462>Yes, it was Chỉ Điểm who was walking.</t1462> <t1463>It seemed clumsy, of course, partly because it was not used to it, and partly because it was too heavy, but it still maintained its balance and walked from one side of the yard to the other.</t1463> <t1464>A moment later, the whole herd of pigs came out from the main door of the house, all of them, without exception, were walking on their hind legs.</t1464> <t1465>Some walked confidently, some staggered, and if they had canes, they would be more stable, but all of them made a round around the yard without any falling.</t1465> <t1466>Finally, there was the sound of dogs barking fiercely, roosters crowing loudly, and Napoleon stepped out, his back straight, looking majestic, surveying the scene, surrounded by a flock of sheep.</t1466>
<t1467>Its front leg held a big whip.</t1467>
<t1468>It was as silent as a sheet around.</t1468> <t1469>Surprised mixed with fear, the animals gathered in a corner to watch the pigs walk around the yard in a line.</t1469> <t1470>Has the world gone completely mad?</t1470> <t1471>The initial panic eventually passed, and despite fearing the dogs, despite years of being accustomed to not daring to complain, not daring to protest, this time they would surely speak out in protest.</t1471> <t1472>But at that moment, as if on cue, the sheep simultaneously cried out:</t1472>
<t1473>"Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!"</t1473>
<t1474>They chanted like that for five minutes straight, without stopping.</t1474> <t1475>When the sheep fell silent, the pigs had already entered the house; even if there were objections, no one would hear them.</t1475>
<t1476>Benjamin felt as if something was rubbing its nose against his shoulder.</t1476> <t1477>He turned his head around.</t1477> <t1478>It turned out to be Mrs. Fat. Her already dim eyes looked sadder than ever.</t1478> <t1479>She gently nibbled at Benjamin's mane and pulled him towards the gable end of the large barn.</t1479> <t1480>They stood there, silently gazing at the white letters on the tarred wall.</t1480>
<t1481>"I can't see anything anymore - Finally, the Fat Lady spoke up - Even when I was young, I couldn't read a single word.</t1481> <t1482>But it seems to me that the wall looks very different.</t1482> <t1483>The Seven Commandments are still the same, aren't they, Benjamin?"</t1483>
<t1484>This is the first time Benjamin has given up its habitual practice and gently read aloud to Mrs. Fat.</t1484> <t1485>On the wall, there was only one Commandment left, which read as follows:</t1485>
<t1486>ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL, BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.</t1486>
<t1487>After that, even the sight of the overseer pigs carrying whips to the fields no longer surprised them.</t1487> <t1488>They were also not surprised to see the pigs buying radios, discussing contracts to install telephones, and subscribing to newspapers like John Bull, Tits-Bit, and the Daily Mirror.</t1488> <t1489>They were not surprised either when they saw Napoleon walking in the garden with a pipe in his mouth, or when they saw the pigs dressing up in Mr. Jones's clothes.</t1489> <t1490>Napoleon chose for himself a black coat, breeches, and leather boots; while the sow he favored most wore the silk dress that Mrs. Jones used to wear to church on Sundays.</t1490>
<t1491>One week later, in the afternoon, many vehicles entered the farm.</t1491> <t1492>These were representatives from neighboring farms invited to visit Animal Farm.</t1492> <t1493>The guests were very surprised when they saw the fields, the farm's production tools, and especially the windmill.</t1493> <t1494>At that time, the animals were weeding the turnip field.</t1494> <t1495>They worked diligently, rarely lifting their heads.</t1495> <t1496>They also did not know which of the two groups, the guests or the pigs, were more frightening.</t1496>
<t1497>That evening, there were loud singing and laughter coming from the main house.</t1497> <t1498>The animals suddenly felt curious, wanting to know what was being discussed in that house because it was the first time humans and animals met as equal partners.</t1498> <t1499>Then, without any prompting, they all lay down and quietly crawled towards the main building.</t1499>
<t1500>They hesitated slightly when crawling to the gate, but Fat Lady had already moved to the front.</t1500> <t1501>As they approached the building, they tiptoed and stood up, those tall enough could see through the window.</t1501> <t1502>Inside, six landowners and the six most outstanding pigs were sitting around a long table.</t1502> <t1503>Napoleon sat right at the head of the table, the most prestigious spot.</t1503> <t1504>It seemed that the pigs had long been accustomed to sitting on chairs.</t1504> <t1505>They had been playing cards, but at that moment had stopped, probably to raise their glasses and toast each other.</t1505> <t1506>A rather large pitcher was being passed around, and all the glasses were filled with beer.</t1506> <t1507>No one paid attention to the animals curiously peeking through the window.</t1507>
<t1508>Mr. Pilkington, from Foxwood Farm, stood up with a beer glass in his hand.</t1508> <t1509>He said that he would propose a toast shortly.</t1509> <t1510>But he asked to say a few words first.</t1510>
<t1511>"It is truly exhilarating," he said, "for him, as well as for everyone present here today, because the period of suspicion and misunderstanding has ended."</t1511> <t1512>There was a time, of course, when he, like those present here today, did not want it to be so, but it is clear that there were times when those around looked at the esteemed owners of Animal Farm with an attitude that, while not hostile, was certainly lacking in goodwill.</t1512> <t1513>Unfortunately, there were a few clashes, and some misconceptions were circulated.</t1513> <t1514>There was an opinion that a farm run by pigs and managed by pigs was an abnormal thing, and there was no doubt that this farm would have an undesirable influence on the surrounding farms.</t1514> <t1515>Many landowners, quite a few, without any investigation, hastily concluded that there would be many excessive and undisciplined behaviors here.</t1515> <t1516>They were worried about the influence of this farm not only on the animals but also on their hired workers.</t1516> <t1517>But all those doubts have ended.</t1517> <t1518>Today, he and his colleagues have been invited to visit the farm, they have examined it very carefully, and what did they find?</t1518> <t1519>Not only the most modern technology but also the discipline and order of the farm are worthy of emulation by farms everywhere.</t1519> <t1520>He believes it is not wrong to say that the lower animals here work more but receive smaller rations compared to other farms in the region.</t1520> <t1521>In short, he and his colleagues have seen many things here that should be immediately applied.</t1521>
<t1522>He said he wished for the friendship between Animal Farm and other farms to last forever.</t1522> <t1523>The interests of pigs and humans do not and should not conflict with each other.</t1523> <t1524>Both share common goals and common difficulties.</t1524> <t1525>The issue of labor is the same everywhere, isn't it?</t1525> <t1526>At this point, it was clear that Pilkington intended to say a humorous remark he had prepared for a long time, but it was so funny that he couldn't utter it.</t1526> <t1527>After a moment of trying to suppress his emotions, Pilkington said the following sentence:</t1527>
<t1528>"If you have to deal with lower animals, then we, we also have to deal with lower classes."</t1528>
<t1529>In response to that meaningful remark, there was laughter that seemed to shake the house, and Pilkington again congratulated the pigs on eating little, working hard, and the discipline and order of the farm.</t1529>
<t1530>And now, Pilkington suggested everyone stand up and fill their glasses with beer.</t1530>
<t1531>"Gentlemen!", Pilkington concluded his speech, "Gentlemen, please raise your glasses to toast the continued prosperity of Animal Farm."</t1531>
<t1532>The sound of applause, the sound of stomping feet thunderously.</t1532> <t1533>Napoleon enjoyed the speech so much that he clinked glasses with Pilkington before drinking.</t1533> <t1534>When the applause had subsided, Napoleon, still standing, declared that he would also like to say a few words.</t1534>
<t1535>Napoleon always spoke briefly and got straight to the heart of the matter.</t1535> <t1536>Napoleon said that he was also very pleased to have cleared up all misunderstandings.</t1536> <t1537>Previously, there had been rumors, certainly propagated by hostile forces, suggesting that he and his associates were pursuing subversive ideas, if not revolutionary ones.</t1537> <t1538>They were accused of intending to incite animals in other farms to revolt.</t1538> <t1539>Slander, fabricated from start to finish!</t1539> <t1540>Their sole desire, now as in the past, was to live in peace and have normal business relations with their neighbors.</t1540> <t1541>The farm that he had the honor of leading, Napoleon added, was a kind of cooperative.</t1541> <t1542>Everything under his management was the common property of all the pigs on the farm.</t1542>
<t1543>Napoleon said that he believed all doubts had been cleared and the recent changes had further increased mutual trust.</t1543> <t1544>Until now, the animals on the farm had an unpleasant habit of calling each other "Comrade".</t1544> <t1545>This habit will be abolished.</t1545> <t1546>Another habit, whose origin is unknown, is the practice of marching in formation every morning around a pig's skull mounted on a post.</t1546> <t1547>This habit will also be abolished and the pig's head has already been buried.</t1547> <t1548>The guests must have had the opportunity to see the green flag flying.</t1548> <t1549>If indeed they have seen it, they must have noticed that the symbol of the white hoof and horn has also been removed.</t1549> <t1550>From now on, the flag will be pure green only.</t1550>
<t1551>He said that he would like to make a few minor adjustments to Mr. Pilkington's extremely concise and well-intentioned speech.</t1551> <t1552>Throughout the speech, Mr. Pilkington referred to this farm as Animal Farm.</t1552> <t1553>Mr. Pilkington, of course, could not have known, because today, for the first time, Napoleon announced the abolition of the name Animal Farm.</t1553> <t1554>From now on, the farm will be known as Manor Farm, as it should be called since that was its original name.</t1554>
<t1555>"Gentlemen!", Napoleon concluded, "I propose a toast, but with a slight modification.</t1555> <t1556>Please fill your glasses first.</t1556> <t1557>Let us toast to the continued prosperity of the Farm!"</t1557>
<t1558>Applause rang out, and everyone raised their glasses.</t1558> <t1559>But the animals standing outside felt like something strange was happening.</t1559> <t1560>Why did the faces of the pigs look like that? Mrs. Fat's cloudy eyes looked from one to another.</t1560> <t1561>Some had five chins, some had four, and some had three. Why did everything become so blurry and change so quickly? The applause ended, the banquet returned to the unfinished card game, and the animals watching outside slowly crawled away.</t1561>
<t1562>But they had just crawled about twenty meters when all of them stopped.</t1562> <t1563>There was a loud shouting coming from the building.</t1563> <t1564>They immediately turned back and continued looking through the window.</t1564> <t1565>The argument was at its peak.</t1565> <t1566>There were shouts, table banging, arguments, and suspicious glances.</t1566> <t1567>The cause of the argument was probably because Napoleon and Pilkington both played the queen of spades at the same time.</t1567>
<t1568>Twelve angry mouths spoke at once, and only heaven could distinguish who was who.</t1568> <t1569>The animals no longer paid attention to the faces of the pigs inside.</t1569> <t1570>They looked at the pigs and then at the humans, looked at the humans and then at the pigs, and after a while, they gave up, unable to tell which was which.</t1570>
<t1571>November 1943 - February 1944.</t1571>
