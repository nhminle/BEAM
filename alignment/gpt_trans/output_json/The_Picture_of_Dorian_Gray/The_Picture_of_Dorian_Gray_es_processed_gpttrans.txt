<t0>Chapter 1</t0>
<t1>The intense perfume of the roses embalmed the studio, and when the light breeze stirred the trees in the garden, an intense scent of lilacs or the more delicate aroma of the pink flowers of the hawthorns entered through the open door.</t1>
<t2>Lord Henry Wotton, who had already consumed, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, glimpsed, from the end of the sofa where he was lying —upholstered in the style of Persian carpets—, the glow of the blossoms of a broom, sweet and honey-colored, whose trembling branches barely seemed capable of bearing the weight of such dazzling beauty as theirs; and, from time to time, the fantastic shadows of birds in flight slid over the long Indian silk curtains hanging in front of the immense windows, producing something like a Japanese effect, which made him think of the painters of Tokyo, with faces as pale as jade, who, through a necessarily motionless art, try to convey the sensation of speed and movement.</t2> <t3>The obstinate buzzing of bees, making their way through the tall unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence around the dusty golden horns of the disordered honeysuckles, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive, while the confused noises of London were like the deep notes of a distant organ.</t3>
<t4>In the center of the room, on a straight easel, rested the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary beauty; and, in front, at a certain distance, sat the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance a few years ago so moved society and gave rise to such strange suppositions.</t4>
<t5>Upon contemplating the handsome and elegant figure that he had so skillfully depicted thanks to his art, a smile of satisfaction, which perhaps could have lasted longer, illuminated his face.</t5> <t6>But the artist abruptly stood up and, closing his eyes, covered his eyelids with his fingers, as if trying to capture in his mind some strange dream from which he feared to awaken.</t6>
<t7>—It is your best work, Basil —said Lord Henry with a languid tone—, the best you have done.</t7> <t8>Be sure to send it to the Grosvenor Gallery next year.</t8> <t9>The Academy is too large and too vulgar.</t9> <t10>Every time I go there, either there are so many people that I can't see the paintings, which is horrible, or there are so many paintings that I can't see the people, which is even worse.</t10> <t11>The Grosvenor Gallery is the right place.</t11>
<t12>—I don't think I'll send it anywhere —replied the artist, throwing his head back in that curious way that always made his friends from Oxford laugh—.</t12> <t13>No; I won't send the portrait anywhere.</t13>
<t14>Lord Henry raised his eyebrows and looked at him with astonishment through the thin curls of smoke that, emerging from his opium-laced cigarette, twisted into strange shapes.</t14>
<t15>—Aren't you going to send it anywhere?</t15> <t16>Why, my dear friend?</t16> <t17>What reason could you give?</t17> <t18>Why are you painters such strange people?</t18> <t19>You do anything to earn a reputation, but as soon as you have it, it seems you don't want it anymore.</t19> <t20>It's foolish, because in the world there's only one thing worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.</t20> <t21>A portrait like that would place you far above all the young English painters and would arouse the jealousy of the old ones, if the old ones are still capable of emotions.</t21>
<t22>—I know you're going to laugh at me —replied Hallward—, but I can't exhibit that portrait.</t22> <t23>I've put too much of myself into it.</t23>
<t24>Lord Henry, stretching out on the sofa, let out a laugh.</t24>
<t25>—Yes, Harry, I knew you were going to laugh, but, anyway, it's nothing but the truth.</t25>
<t26>"Too much of yourself!"</t26> <t27>"By my faith, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; I don't see the slightest resemblance between you, with your well-defined and somewhat harsh features and your hair as black as coal, and that young Adonis, who seems to be made of ivory and rose petals."</t27> <t28>"Come now, my dear Basil, that boy is a Narcissus, and you... well, you have, of course, an intellectual air and all that."</t28> <t29>"But beauty, true beauty, ends where the intellectual air begins."</t29> <t30>"Intellect is, in itself, a form of exaggeration, and it destroys the harmony of any face."</t30> <t31>"The moment someone starts to think, they become all nose or forehead or something dreadful."</t31> <t32>"Look at those who succeed in any learned profession."</t32> <t33>"They are absolutely impossible."</t33> <t34>"With the exception, of course, of the Church."</t34> <t35>"But it happens that in the Church one does not think."</t35> <t36>"A bishop continues to say at eighty what he was told to say at eighteen, and the logical consequence is that he always looks delightful."</t36> <t37>"Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never revealed to me, but whose portrait truly fascinates me, never thinks."</t37> <t38>"I am completely sure of it."</t38> <t39>"He is a beautiful, brainless creature, who should always be here in winter, when we have no flowers to look at, and also in summer, when we seek something to cool our intelligence."</t39> <t40>"Don't delude yourself, Basil: you are nothing like him at all."</t40>
<t41>—You don't understand me, Harry —replied the artist—.</t41> <t42>I'm not like him, of course.</t42> <t43>I know that perfectly well.</t43> <t44>In fact, I would regret resembling him.</t44> <t45>Are you shrugging your shoulders?</t45> <t46>I'm telling you the truth.</t46> <t47>There is an adverse fate tied to bodily or intellectual superiority, the adverse fate that throughout history follows the faltering steps of kings.</t47> <t48>It is much better not to be different from the majority.</t48> <t49>The ugly and the stupid are the ones who have the best time in the world.</t49> <t50>They can sit comfortably and watch the show with their mouths open.</t50> <t51>Even if they know nothing of triumph, at least they are spared the disappointments of defeat.</t51> <t52>They live as we all should live, calmly, carelessly, impassively.</t52> <t53>They neither cause the ruin of others, nor receive it from others.</t53> <t54>Your social status and your wealth, Harry; my brain, whatever it may be; my art, whatever its value; the handsomeness of Dorian Gray: we are all going to suffer for what the gods have given us, and suffer terribly.</t54>
<t55>"Dorian Gray? Is that his name?"</t55> <t56>asked Lord Henry, crossing the studio towards Basil Hallward.</t56>
<t57>—Yes; that's what it's called.</t57> <t58>I didn't intend to tell you.</t58>
<t59>—But, why not?</t59>
<t60>—I can't explain it to you.</t60> <t61>When I like someone very much, I never tell anyone their name.</t61> <t62>It's like giving away a part of that person.</t62> <t63>Over time, I have come to love the secret.</t63> <t64>It seems to be the only thing capable of making modern life mysterious or wonderful.</t64> <t65>Just hiding the most ordinary thing makes it delightful.</t65> <t66>When I leave London now, I never tell my people where I am going.</t66> <t67>If I did, it would stop being pleasurable for me.</t67> <t68>It's a silly habit, I admit, but for some reason, it seems to imbue life with romance.</t68> <t69>I suppose I seem terribly ridiculous to you, don't I?</t69>
<t70>—Absolutely not —replied Lord Henry—; nothing of the sort, my dear Basil.</t70> <t71>You seem to forget that I am married, and the only charm of marriage is that it requires both parties to practice deception assiduously.</t71> <t72>I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.</t72> <t73>When we do meet, which sometimes happens because we go out to dinner together or visit the Duke's house, we tell each other with tremendous seriousness the most absurd stories about our respective activities.</t73> <t74>My wife does it very well; much better than I do, in fact.</t74> <t75>She never gets the dates wrong and I always do.</t75> <t76>But when she catches me, she doesn't get angry.</t76> <t77>Sometimes I wish she would, but she just laughs at me.</t77>
<t78>—I don't like at all how you talk about your married life, Harry —said Basil Hallward, heading towards the door that led to the garden—.</t78> <t79>I think you are actually an excellent husband, but you are ashamed of your virtues.</t79> <t80>You are an extraordinary person.</t80> <t81>You never give moral lessons and you never do anything wrong.</t81> <t82>Your cynicism is nothing but affectation.</t82>
<t83>—Naturalness is also affectation, and the most irritating one I know —exclaimed Lord Henry, bursting into laughter.</t83>
<t84>The two young people went out together to the garden, settling on a wide bamboo bench placed in the shade of a laurel tree.</t84> <t85>The sunlight slid over the waxed leaves.</t85> <t86>White daisies trembled on the grass.</t86>
<t87>After a silence, Lord Henry took out his pocket watch.</t87>
<t88>—I am very much afraid that I must leave, Basil —he murmured—, but before I go, I insist that you answer the question I asked you a while ago.</t88>
<t89>—Which one was it? —said the painter, without lifting his eyes from the ground.</t89>
<t90>—You know it perfectly well.</t90> <t91>—I don't know, Harry.</t91>
<t92>—Well, then I will tell you.</t92> <t93>I want you to explain to me why you are not going to exhibit the portrait of Dorian Gray.</t93> <t94>I want the real reason.</t94>
<t95>—I have given it to you.</t95>
<t96>—No, you haven't.</t96> <t97>You told me that there is too much of you in that portrait.</t97> <t98>And that's childish.</t98> <t99>—Harry—said Basil Hallward, looking him directly in the eyes—, every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.</t99> <t100>The model is merely an accident, the occasion.</t100> <t101>It is not the subject that the painter reveals; rather, it is the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.</t101> <t102>The reason I will not exhibit the picture is that I am afraid I have shown the secret of my own soul.</t102>
<t103>Lord Henry laughed.</t103>
<t104>— And, what is ...? —he asked.</t104>
<t105>—I am going to tell you —replied Hallward; but what appeared on his face was an expression of perplexity.</t105> <t106>—I am all ears, Basil —insisted his companion, glancing at him sideways.</t106>
<t107>—In reality, there is very little to tell, Harry —replied the painter—, and I am afraid you would hardly understand it.</t107> <t108>Perhaps you wouldn't believe it either.</t108>
<t109>Lord Henry smiled and, bending down, plucked a pink-petaled daisy from the grass and began to examine it.</t109>
<t110>—I am sure I will understand it —he replied, staring intently at the small golden disc with white feathers—; and as for believing things, I can believe anything as long as it is totally unbelievable.</t110>
<t111>The air tore some flowers from the trees, and the heavy lilac blooms, with their clusters of stars, swayed languidly.</t111> <t112>A grasshopper began to sing next to the fence, and a dragonfly, long and slender like a blue thread, floated by on its brown gauze wings.</t112> <t113>Lord Henry had the impression of hearing the heartbeat of Basil Hallward, and wondered what was going to happen.</t113>
<t114>—It's a very simple story —said the painter after some time—.</t114> <t115>Two months ago, I attended one of those parties thrown by Lady Brandon, which so many people go to.</t115> <t116>You know that we poor artists have to appear in society from time to time to remind the public that we are not savages.</t116> <t117>Dressed in formal attire and with a white tie, as you once told me, anyone, even a stockbroker, can earn a reputation for being civilized.</t117> <t118>Well, when I had been in the room for about ten minutes, chatting with imposing widows overly adorned with jewelry and tedious academics, I suddenly noticed that someone was looking at me.</t118> <t119>When I turned around, I saw Dorian Gray for the first time.</t119> <t120>When our eyes met, I felt myself turn pale.</t120> <t121>A strange sensation of terror took hold of me.</t121> <t122>I knew that I had before me someone with such a fascinating personality that, if I allowed it, he would absorb my entire existence, my whole soul, even my art.</t122> <t123>I did not want any external influence in my life.</t123> <t124>You know perfectly well how independent I am by nature.</t124> <t125>I have always done what I wanted; at least, until I met Dorian Gray.</t125> <t126>Then... although I don't know how to explain it to you.</t126> <t127>Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis.</t127> <t128>I had the strange feeling that Fate had exquisite joys and terrible sufferings in store for me.</t128> <t129>I got scared and turned around to leave the room.</t129> <t130>It wasn't conscience that drove me to do it: rather something akin to cowardice.</t130> <t131>I don't attribute any merit to myself for having tried to escape.</t131>
<t132>—Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil.</t132> <t133>Conscience is the trade name of the firm.</t133> <t134>That is all.</t134>
<t135>—I don't believe it, Harry, and it seems to me that you don't believe it either.</t135> <t136>Whatever my motive was, and perhaps it was pride, because I have always been very proud, I managed to barely make it to the door.</t136> <t137>But there, of course, I ran into Lady Brandon.</t137> <t138>«You're not leaving so soon, Mr. Hallward?», she shouted at me.</t138> <t139>Do you remember the peculiarly shrill voice she has?</t139>
<t140>—Yes; he is a peacock in everything except beauty —said Lord Henry, undoing the daisy with his long, nervous fingers.</t140>
<t141>—I couldn't get rid of her.</t141> <t142>She introduced me to royal highnesses, military officers and aristocrats, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses.</t142> <t143>She spoke of me as her dearest friend.</t143> <t144>I had only been with her once, but she got it into her head to make me the celebrity of the evening.</t144> <t145>I believe that around that time one of my paintings had great success or at least was talked about in the sensationalist newspapers, which are the measure of immorality in the 19th century.</t145> <t146>Suddenly, I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had affected me so strangely.</t146> <t147>We were very close, almost touching.</t147> <t148>Our gazes crossed again.</t148> <t149>It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce us.</t149> <t150>Perhaps it wasn't recklessness, but something simply inevitable.</t150> <t151>We would have spoken to each other without the need for an introduction.</t151> <t152>I'm sure of it.</t152> <t153>Dorian confirmed it to me later.</t153> <t154>He also felt that we were destined to meet.</t154>
<t155>—And how did Lady Brandon describe that wonderful young man? —asked his friend—.</t155> <t156>I know she likes to give a quick summary of all her guests.</t156> <t157>I remember she introduced me to an elderly gentleman with a red face, covered with all imaginable decorations, and confided in my ear, in a tragic whisper that everyone present must have perfectly heard, the most astonishing details.</t157> <t158>I simply fled.</t158> <t159>I prefer to unmask people myself.</t159> <t160>But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly like an auctioneer treats his goods.</t160> <t161>She either explains them completely backwards or tells everything except what one wants to know.</t161>
<t162>—Poor Lady Brandon!</t162> <t163>You are very hard on her, Harry! —said Hallward languidly.</t163>
<t164>—My dear friend, that good lady was trying to establish a salon, but she has only managed to open a restaurant.</t164> <t165>How do you expect me to admire her?</t165> <t166>But, tell me, what did she tell you about Mr. Dorian Gray?</t166>
<t167>—Something like "charming young man, his poor mother and I absolutely inseparable.</t167> <t168>I've completely forgotten what he does, I'm afraid that..., he does nothing...</t168> <t169>Yes, yes, he plays the piano, or is it the violin, my dear Mr. Gray?"</t169> <t170>Neither of us could avoid laughing, and we became friends instantly.</t170>
<t171>—Laughter is not a bad beginning for a friendship, and certainly it is the best way to end it —said the young lord, plucking another daisy.</t171>
<t172>Hallward shook his head.</t172>
<t173>—You don't understand what friendship is, Harry —he murmured—; nor enmity, for that matter.</t173> <t174>You like everyone; that is to say, everyone leaves you indifferent.</t174>
<t175>—How horribly unfair you are to me! —exclaimed Lord Henry, tipping his hat back to look at the little clouds that, like tangled skeins of bright white silk, wandered through the turquoise hollow of the summer sky—.</t175> <t176>Yes; horribly unfair.</t176> <t177>Of course I distinguish between people.</t177> <t178>I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good reputation, and my enemies for their intelligence.</t178> <t179>One cannot be too careful in choosing one's enemies.</t179> <t180>I don't have a single stupid one.</t180> <t181>They are all people of some intellectual stature and, consequently, they appreciate me.</t181> <t182>Do you think that's too much vanity on my part?</t182> <t183>I think it is.</t183>
<t184>—I agree with you on that.</t184> <t185>But according to your categories, I must be nothing more than an acquaintance.</t185>
<t186>—My dear Basil: you are much more than an acquaintance.</t186> <t187>—And much less than a friend.</t187> <t188>Something like a brother, isn't that right?</t188>
<t189>—Ah, siblings!</t189> <t190>I don't like siblings.</t190> <t191>My older brother never dies, and the younger ones never do anything else.</t191>
<t192>—Harry! —exclaimed Hallward, frowning.</t192>
<t193>—I'm not entirely serious.</t193> <t194>But it is impossible for me not to detest my family.</t194> <t195>I imagine it is because no one can stand people who have the same flaws as they do.</t195> <t196>I perfectly understand the indignation of English democracy at what it calls the vices of the upper classes.</t196> <t197>The masses believe that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their exclusive domain, and when one of us makes a fool of ourselves, they see us as poachers on their land.</t197> <t198>When poor Southwark had to appear in the Divorce Court, the indignation of the masses was truly magnificent.</t198> <t199>And yet, I don't think ten percent of the proletariat lives correctly.</t199>
<t200>—I don't agree with a single word of what you have said and, what's more, I'm sure you feel the same way.</t200>
<t201>Lord Henry stroked his sharp brown beard and tapped the tip of a patent leather boot with his mahogany cane.</t201>
<t202>—How English you are, Basil!</t202> <t203>It's the second time today that you've made that observation.</t203> <t204>If an idea is presented to a genuine Englishman (which is always imprudent), it never occurs to him, even remotely, to stop and think whether the idea is true or false.</t204> <t205>The only thing he considers important is whether the person believes what they are saying.</t205> <t206>Now, the value of an idea has nothing to do with the sincerity of the person expressing it.</t206> <t207>In fact, it is likely that the more insincere the person, the more purely intellectual the idea, since in that case it will not be colored by their needs, desires, or prejudices.</t207> <t208>However, I do not intend to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.</t208> <t209>I like people more than principles, and I like people without principles more than anything in the world.</t209> <t210>Tell me more about Dorian Gray.</t210> <t211>Do you see him often?</t211>
<t212>—Every day.</t212> <t213>I wouldn't be happy if I didn't see him every day.</t213> <t214>It's absolutely necessary for me.</t214>
<t215>—Extraordinary!</t215> <t216>I thought you were only interested in art.</t216> <t217>—Dorian is all my art —said the painter gravely—.</t217> <t218>Sometimes I think, Harry, that the history of the world has only known two important eras.</t218> <t219>The first is the one that sees the emergence of a new artistic technique.</t219> <t220>The second, the one that witnesses the emergence of a new personality, also for art.</t220> <t221>What the invention of oil painting was for the Venetians, or the face of Antinous for the last Greek sculptors, the face of Dorian Gray will be for me someday.</t221> <t222>It's not just that I use him as a model to paint, to draw, to make sketches.</t222> <t223>I've done all that, of course.</t223> <t224>But for me, he is much more than a model or a subject.</t224> <t225>I'm not going to tell you that I'm dissatisfied with what I've achieved, nor that his beauty is such that art cannot express it.</t225> <t226>There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that what I've done since I met Dorian Gray is good, it's the best I've ever done.</t226> <t227>But, in some curious way (I don't know if you'll understand me), his personality has suggested to me a completely new way, a new style.</t227> <t228>I see things differently, I think of them differently.</t228> <t229>Now I am able to recreate life in a way I didn't know before.</t229> <t230>«A dream of beauty in days of meditation».</t230> <t231>Who said that?</t231> <t232>I don't remember; but that has been Dorian Gray for me.</t232> <t233>The mere presence of that boy, because he seems little more than a teenager to me, although he is over twenty, his mere presence...</t233> <t234>Ah!</t234> <t235>I wonder if you can realize what it means.</t235> <t236>Unconsciously, he defines for me the outlines of a new school, a school that has all the passion of the romantic spirit and all the perfection of the Greek.</t236> <t237>The harmony of soul and body, what a marvel!</t237> <t238>In our madness, we have separated the two things, and we have invented a realism that is vulgar, and a hollow idealism.</t238> <t239>Harry!</t239> <t240>If you knew what Dorian is to me!</t240> <t241>Do you remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me so much money, but which I didn't want to part with?</t241> <t242>It is one of the best things I've ever done.</t242> <t243>And, why?</t243> <t244>Because while I was painting it, Dorian Gray was by my side.</t244> <t245>He transmitted some subtle influence to me and for the first time in my life I saw in a simple forest the wonder I had always sought and that had always eluded me.</t245>
<t246>—What you're telling me is extraordinary!</t246> <t247>I must see Dorian Gray.</t247>
<t248>Hallward got up from his seat and began to walk around the garden.</t248> <t249>After a few moments, he returned.</t249>
<t250>—Harry —he said—, Dorian Gray is nothing more to me than an artistic inspiration.</t250> <t251>Perhaps you see nothing in him.</t251> <t252>I see everything.</t252> <t253>He is never more present in my work than when he does not appear in what I paint.</t253> <t254>He is the suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.</t254> <t255>I find him in the curves of certain lines, in the charm and subtlety of certain colors.</t255> <t256>That is all.</t256>
<t257>—Then, why do you refuse to exhibit his portrait? —asked Lord Henry.</t257>
<t258>—Because, without intending to, I have put in that painting the expression of my strange idolatry as an artist, which, of course, I have never wanted to talk to him about.</t258> <t259>He knows nothing.</t259> <t260>He will never know.</t260> <t261>But perhaps the world will guess it; and I do not want to bare my soul before its intrusive and superficial gaze.</t261> <t262>I will never place my heart under its microscope.</t262> <t263>There is too much of myself in that painting, Harry, too much of myself!</t263>
<t264>—Poets are not as scrupulous as you.</t264> <t265>They know how useful passion is when they think about publishing.</t265> <t266>In our days, a broken heart can lead to many editions.</t266>
<t267>—I detest them for that —exclaimed Hallward—.</t267> <t268>An artist should create beautiful things, but without putting anything of their own existence into them.</t268> <t269>We live in an age where art is treated as if it were a form of autobiography.</t269> <t270>We have lost the abstract sense of beauty.</t270> <t271>Someday I will show the world what that is; and that is the reason why the world must never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.</t271>
<t272>—I think you are mistaken, but I am not going to argue with you.</t272> <t273>Only those who are intellectually lost argue.</t273> <t274>Tell me, does Dorian Gray care about you a lot?</t274>
<t275>The painter reflected for a few moments.</t275>
<t276>—He is fond of me —he replied, after a pause—; I know he is fond of me.</t276> <t277>It is true, on the other hand, that I flatter him terribly.</t277> <t278>I find a strange pleasure in telling him things that I know I will regret later.</t278> <t279>Generally, he is charming with me, and we sit in the study and talk about a thousand things.</t279> <t280>From time to time, however, he is terribly inconsiderate, and he seems to enjoy making me suffer.</t280> <t281>Then I feel that I have given my whole soul to someone who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his buttonhole, a decoration that delights his vanity, an ornament for a summer's day.</t281>
<t282>—In summer, the days are usually long, Basil —murmured Lord Henry—.</t282> <t283>Perhaps you will tire before he does.</t283> <t284>It's sad to think about, but undoubtedly genius lasts longer than beauty.</t284> <t285>That explains why we strive so hard to cultivate ourselves.</t285> <t286>In the fierce struggle for existence, we want to have something that lasts, and we fill our heads with trash and data, with the foolish hope of maintaining our position.</t286> <t287>The person who knows everything: that is the modern ideal.</t287> <t288>And the mind of that person who knows everything is a terrible thing, a junk shop, all monsters and dust, and always with prices above their true value.</t288> <t289>I think you will tire first, anyway.</t289> <t290>Someday you will look at your friend, and he will seem a bit blurred, or you won't like the tone of his complexion, or something else.</t290> <t291>You will reproach him bitterly, and you will think, very seriously, that he has treated you badly.</t291> <t292>The next time he visits you, you will show yourself perfectly cold and indifferent.</t292> <t293>It will be a shame, because it will change you.</t293> <t294>What you have told me is a love story, it should be called an aesthetic love story, and the worst thing about any love story is that afterward one feels very little romantic.</t294>
<t295>—Harry, don't talk like that.</t295> <t296>As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.</t296> <t297>You can't feel what I feel.</t297> <t298>You change too often.</t298>
<t299>—Ah, my dear Basil, precisely because of that I am able to feel it!</t299> <t300>Those who are faithful only know the trivial side of love: it is the unfaithful who know its tragedies.</t300>
<t301>Lord Henry struck a match on a delicate silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with an air so self-satisfied and so pleased with himself as if he had summarized the world in a phrase.</t301>
<t302>The sparrows were chattering among the lacquered leaves of the vine, and the blue shadows of the clouds chased each other over the lawn like swallows.</t302> <t303>How pleasant it was to be in the garden!</t303> <t304>And how delightful the emotions of other people!</t304> <t305>Much more so than their ideas, in lord Henry's opinion.</t305> <t306>Our soul and the passions of our friends: those are the fascinating things in life.</t306> <t307>He amused himself by silently recalling the tedious lunch he had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward.</t307> <t308>If he had gone to his aunt's house, he would undoubtedly have encountered lord Goodboy, and they would have only talked about feeding the poor and the need to build model housing.</t308> <t309>All the diners would have emphasized the importance of the virtues that their situation in life exempted them from practicing.</t309> <t310>The rich would speak of the value of thrift, and the idle would eloquently expound on the dignity of work.</t310> <t311>It was delightful to have escaped all that!</t311> <t312>While thinking about his aunt, something seemed to surprise him.</t312> <t313>Turning to Hallward, he said:</t313>
<t314>—I just remembered.</t314>
<t315>—Remember what, Harry?</t315>
<t316>—Where have I heard the name Dorian Gray.</t316>
<t317>"Where?" asked Hallward, frowning slightly.</t317>
<t318>—There is no need for you to get angry.</t318> <t319>It was at my aunt's house, Lady Agatha.</t319> <t320>She told me that she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End and that his name was Dorian Gray.</t320> <t321>I have to confess that she never told me he was good-looking.</t321> <t322>Women do not appreciate beauty; at least, honest women don't.</t322> <t323>She told me he was very serious and very well-disposed.</t323> <t324>Immediately, I imagined a creature with glasses and straight hair, horribly covered in freckles and with enormous flat feet.</t324> <t325>I wish I had known he was your friend.</t325>
<t326>—I'm very glad it wasn't like that, Harry.</t326>
<t327>—Why?</t327>
<t328>—I don't want you to meet him.</t328>
<t329>—Don't you want me to meet him?</t329>
<t330>—No.</t330>
<t331>—Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio —announced the butler, entering the garden.</t331>
<t332>—Now you have to introduce him to me —exclaimed Lord Henry, laughing.</t332>
<t333>The painter turned to his servant, who was forced to blink by the sunlight.</t333>
<t334>—Tell Mr. Gray to wait, Parker.</t334> <t335>I will meet with him in a moment.</t335>
<t336>The butler bowed and withdrew.</t336>
<t337>Hallward then turned to Lord Henry.</t337>
<t338>—Dorian Gray is my dearest friend —he said—.</t338> <t339>He is a simple and kind person.</t339> <t340>Your aunt was right in describing him.</t340> <t341>Do not spoil him.</t341> <t342>Do not try to influence him.</t342> <t343>Your influence would be bad.</t343> <t344>The world is very large and contains many wonderful people.</t344> <t345>Do not take away from me the only person who gives my art all the charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him.</t345> <t346>Keep that in mind, Harry, I trust you —he spoke very slowly, and the words seemed to come out of his mouth almost against his will.</t346>
<t347>—What nonsense you speak! —responded Lord Henry, with a smile.</t347>
<t348>Then, taking Hallward by the arm, he almost led him towards the house.</t348>
<t349>Chapter 2</t349>
<t350>Upon entering, they saw Dorian Gray.</t350> <t351>He was seated at the piano, with his back to them, turning the pages of Schumann's Forest Scenes.</t351>
<t352>—You have to lend it to me, Basil —he exclaimed—.</t352> <t353>I want to learn them by heart.</t353> <t354>They are delightful.</t354>
<t355>—That depends on how you pose today, Dorian.</t355>
<t356>—I am tired of posing, and I don't want a full-body portrait —replied the young man, turning on the piano stool with a capricious and sullen gesture.</t356> <t357>Upon seeing Lord Henry, his cheeks colored for a moment and he proceeded to stand up—.</t357> <t358>Forgive me, Basil, but I didn't know you were accompanied.</t358>
<t359>—I present to you Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old friend of mine from Oxford.</t359> <t360>I was telling him that you are a very disciplined model, and you have just ruined everything.</t360>
<t361>—Except for the pleasure of meeting you, Mr. Gray —said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand—.</t361> <t362>My aunt has often spoken of you.</t362> <t363>You are one of her favorites and, I much fear, also one of her victims.</t363>
<t364>—At the moment, I am on Lady Agatha's blacklist —replied Dorian with an amused expression of remorse—.</t364> <t365>I promised to go with her on Tuesday to a club in Whitechapel and completely forgot about it.</t365> <t366>We were going to play a duet together..., or rather three, I believe.</t366> <t367>I don't know what she will say.</t367> <t368>I'm afraid to visit her.</t368>
<t369>—I will take care of reconciling him with her.</t369> <t370>She feels true devotion for you.</t370> <t371>And I don't think it would matter if you didn't go.</t371> <t372>The audience probably thought it was a duet.</t372> <t373>When Aunt Agatha sits at the piano, she makes enough noise for two people.</t373>
<t374>—That is an insinuation against her and it doesn't leave me in a very good position either —replied Dorian, laughing.</t374>
<t375>Lord Henry stared at him.</t375> <t376>Yes; there was no doubt that he was extraordinarily handsome, with properly arched very red lips, blue eyes full of frankness, and curly blond hair.</t376> <t377>There was something in his face that inspired immediate trust.</t377> <t378>All the candor of youth was present there, as well as all its passionate purity.</t378> <t379>One felt that this young man had not allowed himself to be tainted by the world.</t379> <t380>It was no wonder that Basil Hallward felt veneration for him.</t380>
<t381>—Without a doubt, you are too charming to devote yourself to philanthropy, Mr. Gray —Lord Henry dropped onto the divan and opened the cigarette case.</t381>
<t382>The painter had been busy mixing colors and preparing the brushes.</t382> <t383>He seemed worried and, upon hearing Lord Henry's last remark, looked at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said:</t383>
<t384>—Harry, I want to finish this portrait today.</t384> <t385>Would you think me terribly rude if I asked you to leave?</t385>
<t386>Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray.</t386>
<t387>—Do I have to leave, Mr. Gray? —he asked.</t387>
<t388>—No, please, Lord Henry.</t388> <t389>I can see that Basil is in a bad mood today, and I can't stand him when he sulks.</t389> <t390>Besides, I want you to explain to me why I shouldn't devote myself to philanthropy.</t390>
<t391>—I'm not sure I should tell you, Mr. Gray.</t391> <t392>It's such a tedious matter that it would require serious discussion.</t392> <t393>But, of course, I won't run away after you've told me to stay.</t393> <t394>You don't mind too much, do you, Basil?</t394> <t395>You've told me many times that you like your sisters to have someone to chat with.</t395>
<t396>Hallward bit his lips.</t396>
<t397>—If Dorian wishes, of course you can stay.</t397> <t398>Dorian's whims are laws for everyone, except for himself.</t398>
<t399>Lord Henry picked up his hat and gloves.</t399>
<t400>—You are very insistent, Basil, but unfortunately, I must go.</t400> <t401>I promised to meet someone at the Orleans.</t401> <t402>Goodbye, Mr. Gray.</t402> <t403>Come see me some afternoon on Curzon Street.</t403> <t404>I am almost always home at five.</t404> <t405>Write to me when you decide to come, I would hate to miss your visit.</t405>
<t406>—Basil —exclaimed Dorian Gray—, if Lord Henry Wotton leaves, I will leave too.</t406> <t407>You never part your lips when you paint, and it is very boring to stand on a platform and try to look happy.</t407> <t408>Ask him to stay.</t408> <t409>I insist.</t409>
<t410>—Stay, Harry, to please Dorian and to please me —said Hallward, without taking his eyes off the painting—.</t410> <t411>It is very true that I never talk when I am working, and I do not listen either, which must be incredibly tedious for my poor models.</t411> <t412>I beg you to stay.</t412>
<t413>—And what will become of the gentleman who is waiting for me in Orleans?</t413>
<t414>The painter burst out laughing.</t414>
<t415>—I don't think that will be a problem.</t415> <t416>Sit down again, Harry.</t416> <t417>And now, Dorian, get on the platform and don't move too much or pay attention to what Lord Henry says.</t417> <t418>He has a terrible influence on all my friends, with no exception but me.</t418>
<t419>Dorian Gray ascended the platform with the appearance of a young Greek martyr, and made a slight grimace of discontent directed at Lord Henry, who already inspired in him a great sympathy.</t419> <t420>He was so different from Basil!</t420> <t421>They produced a very pleasant contrast.</t421> <t422>And he had a very beautiful voice.</t422>
<t423>—Is it true that you exert a terrible influence, Lord Henry? —he asked after a few moments—.</t423> <t424>As bad as Basil says?</t424>
<t425>—Good influences do not exist, Mr. Gray.</t425> <t426>All influence is immoral; immoral from a scientific point of view.</t426>
<t427>—Why?</t427>
<t428>—To influence a person is to give them one's own soul.</t428> <t429>That person stops thinking their own thoughts and burning with their own passions.</t429> <t430>Their virtues cease to be real.</t430> <t431>Their sins, if sins exist, are borrowed.</t431> <t432>They become an echo of someone else's music, an actor playing a role that was not written for them.</t432> <t433>The purpose of life is self-development.</t433> <t434>To realize one's nature perfectly—that is what we are here for.</t434> <t435>Nowadays people are afraid of themselves.</t435> <t436>They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself.</t436> <t437>Of course, they are charitable.</t437> <t438>They feed the hungry and clothe the naked.</t438> <t439>But their own souls starve, and they themselves are naked.</t439> <t440>Our race has ceased to have courage.</t440> <t441>Perhaps it has never had it.</t441> <t442>The fear of society, which is the basis of morality; the fear of God, which is the secret of religion: these are the two things that govern us.</t442> <t443>And yet...</t443>
<t444>—Turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy —said the painter, engrossed in his work, only aware that a completely new expression had appeared on the boy's face.</t444>
<t445>—And yet —continued Lord Henry, with his grave and musical voice, and with the peculiar hand movement that was so characteristic of him, and that already distinguished him even in the days of Eton—, I believe that if a man were to live his life fully and completely, if he were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream..., I believe the world would receive such a wave of joy that we would forget all the diseases of medievalism and return to the Hellenic ideal; perhaps even to something more delicate, richer than the Hellenic ideal.</t445> <t446>But even the bravest of us is afraid of himself.</t446> <t447>The mutilation of the savage finds its tragic survival in the self-denial that disfigures our lives.</t447> <t448>We are punished for our refusals.</t448> <t449>All the impulses we strive to strangle multiply in the mind and poison us.</t449> <t450>Let the body sin once, and it will be freed from its sin, because action is a mode of purification.</t450> <t451>Afterwards, nothing remains except the memory of a pleasure or the voluptuousness of a remorse.</t451> <t452>The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.</t452> <t453>If one resists it, the soul grows sick, longing for what it has forbidden to itself, desiring what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.</t453> <t454>It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain.</t454> <t455>It is also in the brain, and only in the brain, that the great sins are committed.</t455> <t456>You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, still with the red roses of youth and the white ones of childhood, have had passions that made you afraid, thoughts that filled you with terror, dreams and moments of wakefulness whose mere memory can stain your cheeks with shame...</t456>
<t457>—Enough! —stammered Dorian Gray—; enough!</t457> <t458>You bewilder me.</t458> <t459>I don't know what to say.</t459> <t460>There is a way to respond to you, but I can't find it.</t460> <t461>Don't speak.</t461> <t462>Let me think.</t462> <t463>Or, rather, let me try to think.</t463>
<t464>For about ten minutes he remained there, motionless, his lips parted and a strange gleam in his eyes.</t464> <t465>He was vaguely aware that completely new influences were at work within him, although, it seemed to him, they actually came from himself.</t465> <t466>The few words that Basil's friend had said to him, words thrown out at random, no doubt, and whimsically paradoxical, had touched some secret chord, never before struck, but which he now felt vibrating and throbbing with peculiar tremors.</t466>
<t467>The music affected him in the same way.</t467> <t468>The music had moved him many times.</t468> <t469>But the music was not directly intelligible.</t469> <t470>It was not a new world, but rather another chaos created within us.</t470> <t471>Words! Simple words!</t471> <t472>How terrible they were!</t472> <t473>How clear, and how sharp and cruel!</t473> <t474>It was not possible to escape.</t474> <t475>And yet, what subtle magic there was in them!</t475> <t476>They seemed to have the virtue of giving a plastic form to shapeless things and possessing a music of their own as sweet as that of a viola or a lute.</t476> <t477>Simple words! Was there anything as real as words?</t477>
<t478>Yes; there were things in his childhood that he never understood, but now he did.</t478> <t479>Life, suddenly, took on a bright red color in his eyes.</t479> <t480>It seemed to him that he had been walking on fire.</t480> <t481>Why hadn't he known it before?</t481>
<t482>With a subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him.</t482> <t483>He knew the psychological moment when nothing should be said.</t483> <t484>He was extremely interested.</t484> <t485>Surprised by the impression his words had made, and recalling a book he had read at sixteen, a book that revealed many things to him that he hadn't known before, he wondered if Dorian Gray was having a similar experience.</t485> <t486>He had merely shot an arrow into the air.</t486> <t487>Had it hit the mark?</t487> <t488>How fascinating that boy was!</t488>
<t489>Hallward painted tirelessly with those wonderful and bold brushstrokes of his that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that, at least in art, come solely from strength.</t489> <t490>He had not noticed the silence.</t490>
<t491>—Basil, I'm tired of standing —exclaimed Gray suddenly—.</t491> <t492>I want to go out to the garden and sit down.</t492> <t493>The air here is suffocating.</t493>
<t494>—You will have to forgive me.</t494> <t495>When I paint, I forget everything else.</t495> <t496>But you have never posed better.</t496> <t497>You have been completely still.</t497> <t498>And I have captured the effect I wanted: the slightly parted lips, and the sparkle in the eyes.</t498> <t499>I don't know what Harry might have told you to achieve this wonderful expression.</t499> <t500>I imagine he was flattering your vanity.</t500> <t501>You must not believe a single word he says.</t501>
<t502>—Of course, it didn't flatter my vanity.</t502> <t503>Perhaps that's why I haven't believed anything he told me.</t503> <t504>—Admit that you believed it all —said Lord Henry, giving him a dreamy and languid look—.</t504> <t505>I'll go out to the garden with you.</t505> <t506>It's horribly hot in the studio.</t506> <t507>Basil, offer us something cold to drink, something with strawberries.</t507>
<t508>—Of course, Harry.</t508> <t509>Just call; as soon as Parker comes, I'll tell him what you want.</t509> <t510>I have to work on the background; I'll join you afterwards.</t510> <t511>Don't keep Dorian too long.</t511> <t512>I've never felt so ready to paint as I do today.</t512> <t513>It's going to be my masterpiece.</t513> <t514>It already is, just as it is now.</t514>
<t515>Lord Henry went out into the garden and found Dorian Gray with his face buried in the large lilac flowers, feverishly drinking in their fresh scent as if it were wine.</t515> <t516>He approached him and placed a hand on his shoulder.</t516>
<t517>—You are right to do that —he murmured—.</t517> <t518>Nothing, except the senses, can cure the soul, just as nothing, except the soul, can cure the senses.</t518>
<t519>The boy started, stepping back.</t519> <t520>His head was uncovered, and the leaves of the bush had tousled his hair, tangling the golden strands.</t520> <t521>There was fear in his eyes, as happens when someone is suddenly awakened.</t521> <t522>His nostrils flared and some hidden nerve twitched the red of his lips, making them tremble.</t522>
<t523>—Yes —continued Lord Henry—; that is one of the great secrets of life: to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.</t523> <t524>You are an astonishing creature.</t524> <t525>You know more than you think you know, but less than you want to.</t525>
<t526>Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away.</t526> <t527>It was impossible for him to stop looking favorably upon that tall and elegant young man beside him.</t527> <t528>His dark and romantic face and his weary air interested him.</t528> <t529>There was something in his voice, deep and languid, that was absolutely fascinating.</t529> <t530>His white, calm hands, which even had something of flowers, possessed a curious charm.</t530> <t531>They moved, when Lord Henry spoke, in a musical manner, and seemed to possess a language of their own.</t531> <t532>But Lord Henry frightened him, and he was ashamed to feel fear.</t532> <t533>How was it that a stranger had made him discover himself?</t533> <t534>He had known Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had not changed him.</t534> <t535>Suddenly, however, he had come across someone who seemed to reveal to him the mystery of existence.</t535> <t536>Although, in any case, what reason was there to feel fear?</t536> <t537>He was neither a schoolboy nor a little girl.</t537> <t538>It was absurd to be frightened.</t538>
<t539>—Let's sit in the shade —said Lord Henry—.</t539> <t540>Parker has brought us the drinks, and if you stay any longer under this blazing sun, your complexion will be ruined and Basil will never paint you again.</t540> <t541>You must not let the sun burn you.</t541> <t542>It would be very unflattering.</t542>
<t543>—What importance does that have? —exclaimed Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat on a bench at the back of the garden.</t543>
<t544>—All the importance in the world, Mr. Gray.</t544>
<t545>—Why?</t545>
<t546>—Because you possess the most wonderful youth, and youth is the most precious thing one can possess.</t546>
<t547>—I don't feel that way, Lord Henry.</t547>
<t548>—No; he does not feel it now.</t548><t549>But someday, when he is old and ugly and full of wrinkles, when thoughts have marked his forehead with their folds and passion has burned his lips with its hateful embers, he will feel it, and he will feel it terribly.</t549><t550>Now, wherever he goes, he seduces everyone.</t550><t551>Will it always be like this?...</t551><t552>You have an extraordinarily handsome face, Mr. Gray.</t552><t553>Do not frown.</t553><t554>It is true.</t554><t555>And beauty is a manifestation of genius; it is even above genius, since it needs no explanation.</t555><t556>It is one of the great gifts of nature, like sunlight, or spring, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon.</t556><t557>It admits no argument.</t557><t558>It has a divine right of sovereignty.</t558><t559>It makes princes of those who possess it.</t559><t560>Are you smiling? Ah!</t560><t561>When you have lost it, you will not smile...</t561><t562>People sometimes say that beauty is only superficial.</t562><t563>Perhaps.</t563><t564>But at least it is not as superficial as thought.</t564><t565>To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders.</t565><t566>Only shallow people do not judge by appearances.</t566><t567>The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the unseen...</t567><t568>Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you.</t568><t569>But what the gods give, they also take away, and very soon.</t569><t570>You only have a few years in which to live truly, perfectly, and fully.</t570><t571>When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no more triumphs left for you, or you will have to be content with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past splendor will make more bitter than defeats.</t571><t572>Every month that passes brings you closer to something dreadful.</t572><t573>Time is jealous of you, and fights against your lilies and your roses.</t573><t574>You will become sallow, your cheeks will sink in, and your eyes will lose their brightness.</t574><t575>You will suffer horribly... Ah! Enjoy your youth while you have it.</t575><t576>Do not squander the gold of your days listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.</t576><t577>These are the sickly aims, the false ideals of our age.</t577><t578>Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you!</t578><t579>Let nothing be lost upon you.</t579><t580>Be always searching for new sensations.</t580><t581>Be afraid of nothing...</t581><t582>A new hedonism: that is what our century wants.</t582><t583>You might be its visible symbol.</t583><t584>With your personality, there is nothing you could not do.</t584><t585>The world belongs to you for a season...</t585><t586>The moment I met you, I saw that you did not realize what you really are, what you really could be.</t586><t587>There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself.</t587><t588>I thought of the tragedy of your wasting what you have.</t588><t589>For youth is the one thing worth having, and it is too short, too short indeed.</t589><t590>The simple flowers of the field wither, but they bloom again.</t590><t591>The gorse will be as yellow next June as it is now.</t591><t592>In a month, there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year, the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.</t592><t593>But we never get back our youth.</t593><t594>The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish.</t594><t595>Our limbs fail, our senses rot.</t595><t596>We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions we were too afraid to yield to, and the exquisite temptations we had not the courage to yield to.</t596><t597>Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!</t597>
<t598>Dorian Gray listened, his eyes wide open, astonished.</t598> <t599>The bouquet of lilacs fell to the ground.</t599> <t600>A silky bee buzzed around him for a moment.</t600> <t601>Then it began to climb laboriously over the star-shaped globes of each flower.</t601> <t602>Dorian Gray watched it with the strange interest in trivial things that we try to cultivate when the more important ones frighten us, or when we are overwhelmed by some new emotion that we do not know how to express, or when some idea that terrifies us suddenly besieges the mind and demands our surrender.</t602> <t603>After some time, the bee took flight.</t603> <t604>Dorian Gray saw it enter the bell of a vine flower.</t604> <t605>The flower seemed to shudder and then gently swayed back and forth.</t605>
<t606>Suddenly, the painter appeared at the studio door and, with brusque gestures, indicated that they should enter the house.</t606> <t607>Dorian Gray and Lord Henry looked at each other and smiled.</t607>
<t608>—I am waiting —exclaimed Hallward—.</t608> <t609>Come, please.</t609> <t610>The light is perfect; bring the glasses.</t610>
<t611>They got up and walked the path together.</t611> <t612>Two green and white butterflies crossed their path, and in the pear tree that occupied a corner of the garden, a blackbird began to sing.</t612>
<t613>—He is glad to have met me, Mr. Gray—said Lord Henry, looking at him.</t613>
<t614>—Yes, now I do.</t614> <t615>I wonder if I will always be happy.</t615>
<t616>—Always! Terrible word.</t616> <t617>It makes me shudder when I hear it.</t617> <t618>Women are so fond of using it.</t618> <t619>They ruin all love stories by trying to make them last forever.</t619> <t620>It is, moreover, a meaningless word.</t620> <t621>The only difference between a whim and a lifelong passion is that the whim lasts a little longer.</t621>
<t622>Upon entering the study, Dorian Gray placed a hand on Lord Henry's arm.</t622>
<t623>—In that case, let our friendship be a whim —she murmured, blushing at her own audacity; then she stepped onto the stage and resumed posing.</t623>
<t624>Lord Henry dropped into a large wicker armchair and watched him.</t624> <t625>The brush's stroke on the canvas was the only noise disturbing the stillness, except when, from time to time, Hallward stepped back to examine his work from a distance.</t625> <t626>In the slanting rays that penetrated through the open door, the dust danced, turned into gold.</t626> <t627>The intense fragrance of the roses seemed to envelop everything.</t627>
<t628>After a quarter of an hour, Hallward stopped painting, looked at Dorian Gray for a long time, and then at the painting for another long time while biting the end of one of his large brushes and frowning.</t628>
<t629>—It's finished —he exclaimed at last; bending down, he signed with large red strokes in the bottom left corner of the canvas.</t629>
<t630>Lord Henry approached to examine the portrait.</t630> <t631>It was, without a doubt, a splendid work of art, and the likeness was excellent.</t631>
<t632>—My dear friend —he said—, I congratulate you with all my heart.</t632> <t633>It is the best portrait of our time.</t633> <t634>Mr. Gray, come and see for yourself.</t634>
<t635>The boy started, as if waking from a dream.</t635>
<t636>—Really finished? —he murmured, stepping down from the platform.</t636>
<t637>—Absolutely —said the painter—.</t637> <t638>And today you have posed better than ever.</t638> <t639>I am very grateful to you.</t639>
<t640>—You owe that entirely to me —interjected Lord Henry—.</t640> <t641>Isn't that right, Mr. Gray?</t641>
<t642>Dorian, without responding, advanced slowly with his back to the painting and then turned towards it.</t642> <t643>Upon seeing it, he stepped back, his cheeks flushed with pleasure for a moment.</t643> <t644>A gleam of joy lit up in his eyes, as if he recognized himself for the first time.</t644> <t645>He remained motionless and amazed, barely aware that Hallward was speaking to him and without grasping the meaning of his words.</t645> <t646>The awareness of his own beauty struck him like a revelation.</t646> <t647>It was the first time.</t647> <t648>Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him until then mere pleasant exaggerations, products of friendship.</t648> <t649>He listened to them, laughed at them, and forgot them.</t649> <t650>They did not influence him.</t650> <t651>Then Lord Henry Wotton had appeared with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible warning about its brevity.</t651> <t652>That had moved him and now, as he gazed intently at the image of his beauty, he grasped the whole truth with blinding clarity.</t652> <t653>Yes, on a not too distant day his face would wrinkle and wither, his eyes would lose color and brightness, the harmony of his figure would break.</t653> <t654>The scarlet red of his lips and the gold of his hair would disappear.</t654> <t655>The life that was to shape his soul would deform his body.</t655> <t656>He would become a horrible, hateful, grotesque being.</t656> <t657>Thinking about it, a very sharp pain pierced him like a knife, making all the fibers of his being tremble.</t657> <t658>The blue of his eyes darkened with a veil of tears.</t658> <t659>He felt as if an icy hand had settled on his heart.</t659>
<t660>—Don't you like it? —Hallward finally exclaimed, somewhat hurt by the boy's silence, not understanding its meaning.</t660>
<t661>—Of course he likes it —said Lord Henry—.</t661> <t662>Who could not like it?</t662> <t663>It is one of the great works of modern art.</t663> <t664>I will give you whatever you want for it.</t664> <t665>It must be mine.</t665>
<t666>—I am not its owner, Harry.</t666>
<t667>—Who is the owner?</t667>
<t668>—Dorian, of course —replied the painter.</t668>
<t669>—He is very fortunate.</t669>
<t670>—How sad it is! —murmured Dorian Gray, his eyes still fixed on the portrait—.</t670> <t671>I will grow old, horrible, dreadful.</t671> <t672>But this picture will always remain young.</t672> <t673>It will never be older than this particular day of June...</t673> <t674>If it were only the other way around!</t674> <t675>If I could always stay young and the picture grow old!</t675> <t676>I would give..., I would give anything for that! I would give my soul!</t676>
<t677>—I don't think you would like that solution very much, Basil —exclaimed Lord Henry, laughing—.</t677> <t678>It would be quite unkind to your work.</t678>
<t679>—I would oppose it with the greatest possible energy, Harry —said Hallward.</t679>
<t680>Dorian Gray turned to look at him.</t680>
<t681>—I am sure you would.</t681> <t682>Your art matters more to you than friends.</t682> <t683>To you, I am nothing more than a little bronze figurine.</t683> <t684>Not even that, I would dare to say.</t684>
<t685>The painter stared at him, astonished.</t685> <t686>Dorian never spoke like that.</t686> <t687>What had happened?</t687> <t688>He seemed very angry.</t688> <t689>His face was flushed and his cheeks were burning.</t689>
<t690>—Yes —continued the young man—: to you, I am less than your ivory Hermes or your silver faun.</t690> <t691>Those you will always like.</t691> <t692>How long will you like me?</t692> <t693>Until I get my first wrinkle.</t693> <t694>Now I know that when beauty is lost, whether much or little, everything is lost.</t694> <t695>Your painting has taught me that.</t695> <t696>Lord Henry Wotton is right.</t696> <t697>Youth is the only thing worth having.</t697> <t698>When I discover that I am aging, I will kill myself.</t698>
<t699>Hallward paled and took his hand.</t699>
<t700>—Dorian! Dorian! —he exclaimed—, don't speak like that.</t700> <t701>I've never had a friend like you, nor will I ever have another.</t701> <t702>Don't tell me you're jealous of material things.</t702> <t703>You are above all of them!</t703>
<t704>—I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.</t704> <t705>I am jealous of my portrait.</t705> <t706>Why should it keep what I am going to lose?</t706> <t707>Every moment that passes takes something from me to give it to him.</t707> <t708>Ah, if it were the other way around!</t708> <t709>If the painting could change and I could always remain as I am now!</t709> <t710>Why did you paint it?</t710> <t711>It will mock me someday, it will mock me mercilessly!</t711>
<t712>His eyes filled with burning tears; he abruptly withdrew his hand and, throwing himself onto the divan, buried his face among the cushions, as if he were praying.</t712>
<t713>—This is your doing, Harry —said the painter bitterly.</t713>
<t714>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t714>
<t715>—It is the real Dorian Gray, that's all.</t715>
<t716>—It is not.</t716>
<t717>—If it isn't, what do I have to do with that?</t717>
<t718>—You should have left when I asked you to —he murmured.</t718>
<t719>—I stayed when you asked me to —was Lord Henry's reply.</t719>
<t720>—Harry, I can't fight with my two best friends at the same time, but between the two of you, you have made me hate the most perfect of my works, and I am going to destroy it.</t720> <t721>What is it, after all, except canvas and color?</t721> <t722>I will not allow a portrait to come between us.</t722>
<t723>Dorian Gray lifted his blond head from the cushion and, with a pale face and eyes red from tears, looked at him as Hallward walked towards the wooden table situated under the high curtained window.</t723> <t724>What had he gone there to do?</t724> <t725>His fingers got lost among the jumble of tin tubes and dry brushes, searching for something.</t725> <t726>Yes, the long palette knife, with its thin, flexible steel blade.</t726> <t727>.</t727> <t728>Once found, he was about to slash the canvas.</t728> <t729>Stifling a groan, the boy jumped off the divan and, running towards Hallward, snatched the knife from his hand, throwing it to the other end of the studio.</t729>
<t730>—No, Basil, don't do it! —he exclaimed—.</t730> <t731>It would be murder!</t731> <t732>—I'm glad that you finally appreciate my work, Dorian —said the painter coldly, once he had recovered from the surprise—.</t732> <t733>I had lost hope.</t733>
<t734>—Appreciate it?</t734> <t735>It fascinates me.</t735> <t736>It's part of myself.</t736> <t737>I notice it.</t737>
<t738>—Alright; as soon as you are dry, you will be varnished and framed and sent to your home.</t738> <t739>Once there, you can do with yourself whatever you want —crossing the room, he rang the bell to order tea—.</t739> <t740>Will you have tea, as is logical, Dorian? And you too, Harry? Or are you against such simple pleasures?</t740>
<t741>—I adore simple pleasures —said Lord Henry—.</t741> <t742>They are the last refuge of complex souls.</t742> <t743>But I do not like scenes, except in the theater.</t743> <t744>How absurd you both are!</t744> <t745>I wonder who defined man as a rational animal.</t745> <t746>It was the most premature definition ever given.</t746> <t747>Man is many things, but not rational.</t747> <t748>And I am glad of it after all: although I would like you not to fight over the painting.</t748> <t749>It would be much better if you gave it to me, Basil.</t749> <t750>This poor boy doesn't really want it, and I do.</t750>
<t751>—If you give it to another person, I will never forgive you! —exclaimed Dorian Gray—; and I do not allow anyone to call me poor boy.</t751>
<t752>—You know that the painting is yours, Dorian.</t752> <t753>I gave it to you before it even existed.</t753>
<t754>—And you also know, Mr. Gray, that you have let yourself be carried away by your feelings and that, in reality, you do not mind being reminded of how young you are.</t754>
<t755>—It would have seemed frankly wrong to me this morning, Lord Henry.</t755>
<t756>—Ah, this morning!</t756> <t757>You have lived a lot since then.</t757>
<t758>The door was heard knocking, the butler entered with the tea tray and placed it on a Japanese table.</t758> <t759>The clinking of cups and saucers and the whistle of a Georgian teapot were heard.</t759> <t760>A page entered carrying two globe-shaped dishes.</t760> <t761>Dorian Gray approached the table and served the tea.</t761> <t762>The other two approached languidly and examined what was under the covers.</t762>
<t763>—Let's go to the theater tonight —proposed Lord Henry—.</t763> <t764>There will be something to see somewhere.</t764> <t765>I have a dinner appointment at White's, but it's just with an old friend, so I can send him a telegram saying that I'm sick or that I can't go due to a prior commitment.</t765> <t766>I think it would be a rather nice excuse, as it would come with the surprise of sincerity.</t766>
<t767>—It's so boring to dress formally! —murmured Hallward—.</t767> <t768>And, once you've done it, you look so awful!</t768>
<t769>—Yes —replied Lord Henry distractedly—, the clothing of the 19th century is detestable.</t769> <t770>So gloomy, so depressing.</t770> <t771>Sin is the only element of color left in modern life.</t771>
<t772>—You shouldn't say things like that in front of Dorian, Harry.</t772>
<t773>—In front of which Dorian? The one serving us tea or the one in the painting?</t773>
<t774>—Neither of them.</t774>
<t775>—I would like to go to the theater with you, Lord Henry —said the boy.</t775>
<t776>—Come, then; and you too, Basil.</t776>
<t777>—The truth is that I can't.</t777> <t778>It would be better not to.</t778> <t779>I have a lot of work.</t779>
<t780>—Well; in that case, you and I will go, Mr. Gray.</t780>
<t781>—Delighted.</t781>
<t782>The painter bit his lip and, with the cup in his hand, approached the painting.</t782>
<t783>—I will stay with the real Dorian —he said sadly.</t783>
<t784>—Is that the real Dorian? —exclaimed the original of the portrait, approaching Hallward—.</t784> <t785>Am I really like that?</t785> <t786>—Yes; exactly like that.</t786>
<t787>—Marvelous, Basil!</t787>
<t788>—You at least look the same.</t788> <t789>But he won't change —sighed Hallward—.</t789> <t790>That's something.</t790>
<t791>—What an obsession people have with fidelity! —exclaimed Lord Henry—.</t791> <t792>Even love is simply a matter of physiology.</t792> <t793>It has nothing to do with the will.</t793> <t794>Young people want to be faithful and are not; old people want to be unfaithful and cannot: that is all there is to say.</t794>
<t795>—Don't go to the theater tonight, Dorian —said Hallward—.</t795> <t796>Stay and have dinner with me.</t796>
<t797>—I can't, Basil.</t797>
<t798>—Why not?</t798>
<t799>—Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.</t799>
<t800>—His opinion of you won't improve just because you keep your promises.</t800> <t801>He always breaks his.</t801> <t802>I beg you not to go.</t802>
<t803>Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.</t803>
<t804>—I beg you.</t804>
<t805>The boy hesitated and looked towards Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea table with an amused smile.</t805>
<t806>—I have to go, Basil —replied the young man.</t806>
<t807>—Very well —said Hallward; and, stepping away, he placed his cup on the tray—.</t807> <t808>It is quite late and, since you have to get dressed, it would be best if you didn't waste any more time.</t808> <t809>Goodbye, Harry.</t809> <t810>Goodbye, Dorian.</t810> <t811>Come see me soon.</t811> <t812>Tomorrow.</t812>
<t813>—Of course.</t813>
<t814>—Will you not forget it?</t814>
<t815>—No, of course not! —exclaimed Dorian.</t815>
<t816>—And..., Harry!</t816>
<t817>—Yes, Basil?</t817>
<t818>—Remember what I asked you when we were in the garden this morning.</t818>
<t819>—I have forgotten it.</t819>
<t820>—I trust you.</t820>
<t821>—I wish I could trust myself —said Lord Henry, laughing—.</t821> <t822>Come on, Mr. Gray, my carriage is outside, I can take you home.</t822> <t823>Goodbye, Basil.</t823> <t824>It has been a very interesting afternoon.</t824>
<t825>When the door closed behind them, the painter let himself fall onto a sofa, and an expression of suffering appeared on his face.</t825>
<t826>Chapter 3</t826>
<t827>At half past twelve the next day, Lord Henry Wotton walked from Curzon Street to Albany to visit his uncle, Lord Fermor, an old bachelor, cordial but somewhat brusque, who was generally considered selfish because the world gained no benefit from him, but whom good society deemed generous because he fed people who amused him.</t827> <t828>His father had been an ambassador in Madrid when Isabel II was young and no one had yet thought of General Prim, but he capriciously abandoned his diplomatic career out of spite when he saw that he was not offered the embassy in Paris, a position he believed he had full right to due to his birth, his indolence, the excellent English of his dispatches, and his excessive passion for pleasures.</t828> <t829>The son, who had been his father's secretary and who also resigned, a gesture that was considered somewhat reckless at the time, succeeded his father in the title a few months later, and dedicated himself seriously to cultivating the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.</t829> <t830>Although he owned two large houses in London, he preferred to live in rented rooms, which caused him fewer inconveniences, and he took most of his meals at his club.</t830> <t831>He was somewhat concerned with the management of his coal mines in the Midlands, and excused that contact with industry by claiming that owning coal mines granted a gentleman the privilege of burning wood in his own fireplace.</t831> <t832>In politics, he was a conservative, except when the conservatives were in power, at which time he systematically insulted them, accusing them of being a bunch of radicals.</t832> <t833>He was a hero to his valet, who tyrannized him, and a terrifying figure to most of his relatives, whom he, in turn, tyrannized.</t833> <t834>He was a person who could only have been born in England, and he always claimed that the country was going to ruin.</t834> <t835>His principles were outdated, but much could be said in favor of his prejudices.</t835>
<t836>When Lord Henry entered his uncle's room, he found him dressed in a coarse hunting jacket, smoking a Havana cigar, and grumbling while reading The Times.</t836>
<t837>—Well, Harry —said the elderly gentleman—, what has made you leave the house so early?</t837> <t838>I thought dandies didn't get up until two and didn't appear in public until five.</t838>
<t839>—Pure familial affection, Uncle George, I assure you.</t839> <t840>I want to ask you something.</t840>
<t841>—Money, I imagine —responded Lord Fermor, twisting his expression—.</t841> <t842>Well; sit down and tell me everything.</t842> <t843>These days, young people imagine that money is everything.</t843>
<t844>—Yes —murmured Lord Henry, adjusting the flower in his jacket's buttonhole—; and when they grow old, they don't imagine it: they know it.</t844> <t845>But I don't want money.</t845> <t846>Only people who pay their bills need money, Uncle George, and I never pay mine.</t846> <t847>Credit is the capital of a second son, and one lives pleasantly with it.</t847> <t848>Besides, I always deal with the suppliers from Dartmoor and, consequently, they never bother me.</t848> <t849>What I want is information: not useful information, of course; perfectly useless information.</t849>
<t850>—I can tell you everything that any official report contains, although those who write them nowadays write a lot of nonsense.</t850> <t851>When I was in the diplomatic corps, things were much better.</t851> <t852>But, as I understand it, now they have to take an entrance exam.</t852> <t853>Should we be surprised at the result?</t853> <t854>Exams, my dear sir, are pure lies from beginning to end.</t854> <t855>If a person is a gentleman, he knows more than enough, and if he is not, everything he knows is bad for him.</t855>
<t856>—Mr. Dorian Gray has nothing to do with the world of official reports, Uncle George —said Lord Henry languidly.</t856>
<t857>—Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he? —asked Lord Fermor, furrowing his thick gray brow.</t857>
<t858>—That is what I have come to find out, Uncle George.</t858> <t859>I should rather say, I know who he is.</t859> <t860>He is the grandson of the last Lord Kelso.</t860> <t861>His mother was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux.</t861> <t862>I want you to tell me about his mother.</t862> <t863>What was she like?</t863> <t864>Whom did she marry?</t864> <t865>You practically dealt with everyone in your time, so perhaps you knew her.</t865> <t866>At the present moment, I am very interested in Mr. Gray.</t866> <t867>He has just been introduced to me.</t867>
<t868>—Grandson of Kelso! —repeated the elderly gentleman—.</t868> <t869>The grandson of Kelso... Of course... I knew his mother very well.</t869> <t870>I believe I attended his christening.</t870> <t871>She was an extraordinarily beautiful young woman, Margaret Devereux, and she drove everyone mad by running off with a young man who didn't have a penny, a nobody, sir, a non-commissioned infantry officer or something like that.</t871> <t872>Indeed.</t872> <t873>I remember it all as if it had happened yesterday.</t873> <t874>The poor fellow was killed in a duel in Spa a few months after the wedding.</t874> <t875>A very ugly story.</t875> <t876>They said Kelso hired an unscrupulous adventurer, a Belgian brute, to publicly insult his son-in-law; he paid him, sir, to do it; he paid him and then that individual skewered the non-commissioned officer like a pigeon.</t876> <t877>They covered up the matter, but, good heavens, Kelso dined alone at the club for some time after that.</t877> <t878>He took his daughter in, so I was told, but the girl never spoke to him again.</t878> <t879>Yes, yes, a very ugly affair.</t879> <t880>Margaret also died, in less than a year.</t880> <t881>So she left a son, didn't she?</t881> <t882>I had forgotten.</t882> <t883>What is the boy like?</t883> <t884>If he is like his mother, he must be quite handsome.</t884>
<t885>—He is quite handsome —agreed Lord Henry.</t885>
<t886>—I hope it falls into good hands —continued the old man—.</t886> <t887>He will inherit a lot of money if Kelso has treated him well.</t887> <t888>His mother also had money.</t888> <t889>She received all the Selby properties through her grandfather.</t889> <t890>His grandfather hated Kelso, he considered him a very stingy man.</t890> <t891>And he was not wrong.</t891> <t892>He went to Madrid once when I was there.</t892> <t893>Good heavens, he made me ashamed of him.</t893> <t894>The queen asked me who the English nobleman was who always argued with the coachmen over the fare.</t894> <t895>What a story.</t895> <t896>I spent a month without appearing at the Court.</t896> <t897>I trust he treated his grandson better than the hired coachmen.</t897>
<t898>—I don't know —responded Lord Henry—.</t898> <t899>I imagine the boy will want for nothing.</t899> <t900>He is still not of age.</t900> <t901>I know Selby is his: I know because he told me so.</t901> <t902>And... was his mother very beautiful then?</t902>
<t903>—Margaret Devereux was one of the most charming creatures I have ever seen, Harry.</t903> <t904>What drove her to behave as she did is something I will never understand.</t904> <t905>She could have married anyone she wanted.</t905> <t906>Carlington was madly in love with her.</t906> <t907>But she was a romantic.</t907> <t908>All the women in that family have been.</t908> <t909>The men were worthless, but, good heavens, the women were wonderful.</t909> <t910>Carlington proposed on his knees.</t910> <t911>He told me so himself.</t911> <t912>Margaret Devereux laughed at him, and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who didn't want to catch him.</t912> <t913>And, by the way, Harry, speaking of foolish marriages, what is that nonsense your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American?</t913> <t914>Are English girls not good enough for him?</t914>
<t915>—Now it's quite fashionable to marry American women, Uncle George.</t915>
<t916>—I support English women against the whole world, Harry —said Lord Fermor, hitting the table with his fist.</t916>
<t917>—Everyone bets on the Americans.</t917>
<t918>—They don't last, so I've been told —murmured his uncle.</t918> <t919>—Long-distance races wear them out, but they are unmatched in obstacle races.</t919> <t920>They jump over everything without blinking.</t920> <t921>I don't think Dartmoor has the slightest chance.</t921>
<t922>—Who are your parents? —grumbled the old man—.</t922> <t923>Do you even have any?</t923>
<t924>Lord Henry shook his head.</t924>
<t925>—American young women are as clever at hiding things from their parents as English women are at concealing their past —said Lord Henry, getting up to leave.</t925>
<t926>—They must be butchers, I suppose.</t926>
<t927>—I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake.</t927> <t928>They tell me that butchery is one of the most lucrative professions in the United States, after politics.</t928>
<t929>—Is that girl pretty?</t929>
<t930>—She behaves as if she were beautiful.</t930> <t931>Most American women do.</t931> <t932>It's the secret of their charm.</t932>
<t933>—Why don't they stay in their country?</t933> <t934>They are always telling us that it is a paradise for women.</t934>
<t935>—It is.</t935> <t936>That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious to leave it —said Lord Henry—.</t936> <t937>Goodbye, Uncle George.</t937> <t938>Thank you for giving me the information I wanted.</t938> <t939>I like to know everything about my new friends and nothing about the old ones.</t939>
<t940>—Where are you having lunch today, Harry?</t940>
<t941>—At Aunt Agatha's house.</t941> <t942>I have arranged for her to invite me, along with Mr. Gray, who is her latest protégé.</t942>
<t943>—Hmm! Tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me anymore with her charitable enterprises.</t943> <t944>I'm fed up.</t944> <t945>Goodness, the good woman thinks I have nothing better to do than write checks for her stupid whims.</t945>
<t946>—Alright, Uncle George, I'll tell him, but it won't have any effect.</t946> <t947>Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity.</t947> <t948>They are recognized by that.</t948>
<t949>The elderly gentleman grunted approvingly and called for his servant to come in.</t949>
<t950>Lord Henry crossed some low arcades to reach Burlington Street, and made his way towards Berkeley Square.</t950>
<t951>That was, therefore, the family history of Dorian Gray.</t951><t952>Despite the schematic nature of the story, it had impressed him because it made one think of a strange, almost modern love story.</t952><t953>A beautiful woman who risks everything for a mad passion.</t953><t954>A few weeks of boundless happiness cut short by a heinous crime, by a betrayal.</t954><t955>Months of silent suffering, and then a child born in pain.</t955><t956>The mother snatched away by death, the child abandoned to loneliness and the tyranny of a heartless old man.</t956><t957>Yes; some interesting antecedents, which placed the boy, which added a new perfection to him, so to speak.</t957><t958>Behind all exquisite things, there is something tragic.</t958><t959>For the humblest of flowers to bloom, the effort of worlds is needed...</t959><t960>And, how charming he had been during dinner the night before, when, with surprise in his eyes and lips parted in pleasure and fear, he had sat across from him at the club, the red screens of the lamps enhancing the blush awakened in his face by astonishment!</t960><t961>Talking to him was like playing the most delicate of violins.</t961><t962>Dorian responded to every touch and vibration of the bow...</t962><t963>There was something terribly captivating about influencing someone.</t963><t964>There was no other activity like it.</t964><t965>Projecting the soul onto a pleasing form, pausing for a moment; emitting one's own ideas to be echoed back, accompanied by the music of youthful passion; transmitting one's own sensitivity to another as if it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume; there lay the source of true joy, perhaps the most satisfying that such a mean and vulgar age as ours still allows, an age crudely carnal in its pleasures and enormously vulgar in its goals...</t965><t966>That boy whom he had met by a strange chance in Basil's studio also embodied a wonderful model or, at least, could be turned into a wonderful being.</t966><t967>His was the charm, and the immaculate purity of adolescence, along with a beauty that only ancient Greek marbles preserve for us.</t967><t968>There was nothing that could not be done with him.</t968><t969>He could be turned into a titan or a toy.</t969><t970>What a pity that such beauty was destined to wither!... And Basil?</t970><t971>From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was!</t971><t972>A new artistic style, a new way of seeing life, all suggested so strangely by the mere presence of someone who was all that unconsciously; the silent spirit that dwells in shadowy forests and walks unseen through open fields, suddenly revealing itself like a dryad, and without fear, because in the soul that seeks it, that singular capacity has already awakened, to which the revelation of wonderful things corresponds; the simple forms, the simple contours of things that were stylized, so to speak, acquiring something akin to symbolic value, as if they were in turn the sketch of another more perfect form, whose shadow endowed them with reality: how strange it all was!</t972><t973>He remembered something similar in the history of thought.</t973><t974>Was it not Plato, that artist of ideas, who had analyzed it for the first time?</t974><t975>Was it not Buonarotti who sculpted it in the multicolored marble of a succession of sonnets?</t975><t976>But in our century it was strange...</t976><t977>Yes; he would try to be for Dorian Gray what he, unknowingly, had been for the author of that wonderful portrait.</t977><t978>He would try to dominate him; in reality, he had already done so halfway.</t978><t979>He would make that wonderful spirit his own.</t979><t980>There was something fascinating about that child of Love and Death.</t980>
<t981>Suddenly, Lord Henry stopped and contemplated the houses that surrounded him.</t981> <t982>He realized that he had passed his aunt's house and, smiling, retraced his steps.</t982> <t983>When he entered the somewhat gloomy hall, the butler informed him that the diners had already sat down at the table.</t983> <t984>He handed his hat and cane to one of the footmen and proceeded to the dining room.</t984>
<t985>—Late as usual —exclaimed his aunt, reprimanding him with a shake of her head.</t985>
<t986>Lord Henry invented a trivial excuse and, after settling into the empty seat next to Lady Agatha, looked around to see the guests.</t986> <t987>Dorian Gray gave him a timid nod from the end of the table, a blush of satisfaction appearing on his cheeks.</t987> <t988>Opposite him was the Duchess of Harley, a lady with admirable character and courage, much loved by all who knew her, and with the ample architectural proportions that contemporary historians, when not referring to duchesses, call corpulence.</t988> <t989>To his right sat Sir Thomas Burdon, a radical member of Parliament, who followed his leader in public life and the best chefs in private, dining with the conservatives and thinking with the liberals, according to a rule as prudent as it was well-known.</t989> <t990>The seat to the left of the Duchess was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an elderly gentleman of considerable charm and culture, who had nevertheless fallen into the bad habit of keeping silent, since, as he once explained to Lady Agatha, everything he had to say he had said before he turned thirty.</t990> <t991>To the left of Lord Henry sat Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest friends, saintly among women, but so terribly unattractive that she made one think of a poorly bound hymnal.</t991> <t992>Fortunately for him, Mrs. Vandeleur had on her other side Lord Faudel—a very intelligent mediocrity, over forty years old and as bald as a ministerial statement in the House of Commons—with whom she conversed in that intensely serious manner that is the only unforgivable error, as he himself had once pointed out, that all truly good people fall into and from which none of them entirely escape.</t992>
<t993>—We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry —exclaimed the duchess, giving him a friendly nod from across the table—.</t993> <t994>Do you think he will really marry that fascinating young woman?</t994>
<t995>—I believe the young woman is determined to ask for her hand, Duchess.</t995>
<t996>—What a fright! —exclaimed Lady Agatha—.</t996> <t997>Someone should take action on this matter.</t997>
<t998>—I have been reliably informed that his father owns a gravel warehouse —said Sir Thomas Burdon disdainfully.</t998>
<t999>—My uncle has suggested that it is about charcuterie, Sir Thomas.</t999>
<t1000>—Arid goods! What kind of merchandise is that?</t1000> <t1001>—asked the duchess, raising her large hands in a gesture of astonishment and heavily emphasizing the verb.</t1001>
<t1002>—American novels —replied Lord Henry, while serving himself a quail.</t1002>
<t1003>The duchess seemed bewildered.</t1003>
<t1004>—Don't pay attention to him, dear —whispered Lady Agatha—.</t1004> <t1005>My nephew never speaks seriously.</t1005>
<t1006>—When America was discovered... —intervened the radical member of the House of Commons, proceeding to enumerate some extremely boring facts.</t1006> <t1007>Like all people who try to exhaust a topic, he succeeded in exhausting his listeners.</t1007> <t1008>The duchess sighed and used her privileged position to interrupt.</t1008>
<t1009>—I wish they had never discovered it! —he exclaimed—.</t1009> <t1010>To tell the truth, our young women don't have the slightest chance now.</t1010> <t1011>It's a great injustice.</t1011>
<t1012>—Perhaps, after all, America was never truly discovered —said Mr. Erskine—; I would rather say it was merely detected.</t1012>
<t1013>—Yes, yes, but I have seen specimens of its inhabitants —the duchess responded vaguely—.</t1013> <t1014>I must confess that most of the women are extraordinarily beautiful.</t1014> <t1015>And they also dress well.</t1015> <t1016>They buy all their clothes in Paris.</t1016> <t1017>I would like to be able to afford it.</t1017>
<t1018>—They say that when good Americans die, they go to Paris —chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of discarded witty phrases.</t1018>
<t1019>—Really?</t1019> <t1020>And, where do the bad ones go? —the duchess wanted to know.</t1020>
<t1021>—They are going to the United States —murmured Lord Henry.</t1021>
<t1022>Sir Thomas frowned.</t1022>
<t1023>—I am afraid your nephew has prejudices against that great country —he said to Lady Agatha—.</t1023> <t1024>I have traveled all over the territory, in cars provided by the directors, who are extraordinarily hospitable in these matters.</t1024> <t1025>I assure you it is very instructive to visit the United States.</t1025>
<t1026>—Do we really have to see Chicago to be well-educated? —asked Mr. Erskine querulously—.</t1026> <t1027>I don't feel capable of undertaking that trip.</t1027>
<t1028>Sir Thomas waved his hand.</t1028>
<t1029>—Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on the shelves of his library.</t1029> <t1030>We, practical men, like to see things, not read their descriptions.</t1030> <t1031>Americans are a very interesting people.</t1031> <t1032>And totally reasonable.</t1032> <t1033>I think that is the characteristic that distinguishes them.</t1033> <t1034>Yes, Mr. Erskine, a totally reasonable people.</t1034> <t1035>I assure you that Americans do not beat around the bush.</t1035>
<t1036>—Terrible! —exclaimed Lord Henry—.</t1036> <t1037>I do not like brute force, but brute reason is absolutely unbearable.</t1037> <t1038>It is not right to use it.</t1038> <t1039>It is like hitting below the intellect.</t1039>
<t1040>—I don't understand you —said Sir Thomas, blushing considerably.</t1040>
<t1041>—I do, Lord Henry —murmured Mr. Erskine with a smile.</t1041>
<t1042>—Paradoxes are all well and good in their own way... —interjected the baronet.</t1042>
<t1043>—Was that a paradox? —asked Mr. Erskine—.</t1043> <t1044>It didn't seem like it to me.</t1044> <t1045>Maybe it was.</t1045> <t1046>Well, the path of paradoxes is the path of truth.</t1046> <t1047>To test reality, we must see it on the tightrope.</t1047> <t1048>When truths become acrobats, we can judge them.</t1048>
<t1049>—Good heavens! —said Lady Agatha—, how you men argue!</t1049> <t1050>I'm sure I'll never know what you're talking about.</t1050> <t1051>By the way, Harry, I am very angry with you.</t1051> <t1052>Why are you trying to convince our Dorian Gray, such a charming person, to give up the East End?</t1052> <t1053>I assure you it would be invaluable.</t1053> <t1054>Our regulars would have loved to hear him play.</t1054>
<t1055>—I want you to play for me —exclaimed Lord Henry, smiling.</t1055> <t1056>When he looked towards the end of the table, he caught a gleam in Dorian's eyes as a response.</t1056>
<t1057>—But in Whitechapel, people are very unfortunate —protested Lady Agatha.</t1057>
<t1058>—I can sympathize with anything except suffering —said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders—.</t1058> <t1059>I can't go that far.</t1059> <t1060>It's too ugly, too horrible, too distressing.</t1060> <t1061>There is something terribly morbid about our era's sympathy for pain.</t1061> <t1062>We should be interested in colors, in beauty, in the joy of living.</t1062> <t1063>The less we talk about the miseries of life, the better.</t1063>
<t1064>—In any case, the East End is a very important problem —remarked Sir Thomas, with a grave nod of his head.</t1064>
<t1065>—Very true —replied the young lord—.</t1065> <t1066>It is the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by entertaining the slaves.</t1066>
<t1067>The politician looked at him with great interest.</t1067>
<t1068>—What change do you propose, in that case? —he asked.</t1068> <t1069>Lord Henry laughed.</t1069>
<t1070>—I do not wish to change anything in England, except the weather —he replied—.</t1070> <t1071>I am more than satisfied with philosophical contemplation.</t1071> <t1072>But since the 19th century has been ruined by an excessive expenditure of sympathy, I suggest turning to science to solve it.</t1072> <t1073>The advantage of emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it excludes emotion.</t1073>
<t1074>—But we have very serious responsibilities —ventured Mrs. Uandeleur timidly.</t1074>
<t1075>—Extremely serious - echoed Lady Agatha.</t1075>
<t1076>Lord Henry looked intently at Mr. Erskine.</t1076>
<t1077>—Humanity takes itself too seriously.</t1077> <t1078>It is the original sin of the world.</t1078> <t1079>If the cavemen had known how to laugh, history would have been different.</t1079>
<t1080>—You don't know how much it comforts me to hear you —chirped the duchess—.</t1080> <t1081>I always feel very guilty when I come to see your dear aunt, because I am not at all interested in the East End.</t1081> <t1082>In the future, I will be able to look her in the face without blushing.</t1082>
<t1083>—Blushing is very becoming, Duchess —remarked Lord Henry.</t1083>
<t1084>—Only when one is young —she replied—.</t1084> <t1085>When an old woman like me blushes, it's a very bad sign.</t1085> <t1086>Ah, I wish you could tell me how to be young again!</t1086> <t1087>Lord Henry pondered for a moment.</t1087>
<t1088>—Do you remember any big mistake you made in your early days, Duchess? —he asked, looking at her from the other side of the table.</t1088>
<t1089>—Many, unfortunately —she exclaimed.</t1089>
<t1090>—Well, commit them again —he said gravely—.</t1090> <t1091>To regain youth, it is enough to repeat the same follies.</t1091>
<t1092>—Delicious theory! —she exclaimed—.</t1092> <t1093>I must put it into practice.</t1093>
<t1094>—A dangerous theory! —said Sir Thomas, his mouth tense.</t1094> <t1095>Lady Agatha shook her head disapprovingly, but the idea still seemed amusing to her.</t1095> <t1096>Mr. Erskine was listening.</t1096>
<t1097>—Yes —continued the young lord—; it is one of the great secrets of life.</t1097> <t1098>Nowadays, most people die of an indigestion of common sense and discover when it is already too late that the only things we never regret are our mistakes.</t1098>
<t1099>Laughter was heard around the table.</t1099>
<t1100>Lord Henry played with the idea, becoming more and more animated; he tossed it into the air and transformed it; he let it escape and recaptured it; he adorned it with all the fires of fantasy and gave it wings with paradox.</t1100> <t1101>The praise of folly, as Lord Henry continued, rose to the heights of philosophy, and philosophy itself became young and, infected by the unrestrained music of pleasure, dressed, one might imagine, in its wine-stained robe and an ivy garland, danced like a bacchante over the hills of life and mocked the placid Silenus for his sobriety.</t1101> <t1102>Facts fled before it like frightened little animals of the forest.</t1102> <t1103>Its alabaster feet trod the enormous winepress where the wise Omar holds court, until the rosy juice of the vine rose around its bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or slid in foam down the black sloping walls of the vat.</t1103> <t1104>It was an extraordinary improvisation.</t1104> <t1105>Lord Henry felt Dorian Gray's eyes fixed on him, and knowing that among those listening there was someone he wished to fascinate seemed to sharpen his wit and lend brighter colors to his imagination.</t1105> <t1106>He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible.</t1106> <t1107>He enchanted his listeners, making them forget themselves, and follow, laughing, the melody of his pipe.</t1107> <t1108>Dorian Gray never took his eyes off him, and remained motionless as if he were enchanted, smiles succeeding one another on his lips, while the astonishment in the depths of his eyes took on a thoughtful gravity.</t1108>
<t1109>Finally, covered in the livery of the time, reality entered the room in the form of a footman to announce that the duchess's carriage was waiting for her.</t1109> <t1110>The noble lady wrung her hands in feigned despair.</t1110>
<t1111>—What a nuisance! —she exclaimed—.</t1111> <t1112>I have to leave.</t1112> <t1113>I have to pick up my husband at the club to take him to Willis's Rooms, where he has to preside over some absurd meeting.</t1113> <t1114>If I arrive late, he will undoubtedly be furious, and I can't risk a scene with this hat.</t1114> <t1115>It is too fragile.</t1115> <t1116>A harsh word would destroy it.</t1116> <t1117>No, I must go, my dear Agatha.</t1117> <t1118>Goodbye, Lord Henry, you are absolutely delightful and terribly demoralizing.</t1118> <t1119>Of course, I wouldn't know what to say about your ideas.</t1119> <t1120>You must come to dinner with us one of these nights.</t1120> <t1121>Tuesday? Are you free on Tuesday?</t1121>
<t1122>—For you, Duchess, whom would I not do without? —replied Lord Henry, with a nod of his head.</t1122> <t1123>—Ah! Very kind and very cruel of you! —exclaimed the Duchess—; but don't forget to come —and she left the room followed by Lady Agatha and the other ladies.</t1123> <t1124>When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine, walking around the table, and placing himself beside him, put a hand on his arm.</t1124>
<t1125>—You talk a lot about books —he said—; why don't you write one?</t1125>
<t1126>—I like reading them too much to bother writing them, Mr. Erskine.</t1126> <t1127>Of course, I would like to write a novel, a novel that would be as charming and unreal as a Persian carpet.</t1127> <t1128>But in England, there is an audience only for newspapers, textbooks, and encyclopedias.</t1128> <t1129>There are no people in the whole world with less sense of literary beauty than the English.</t1129>
<t1130>—I am afraid you are right —replied Mr. Erskine—.</t1130> <t1131>I myself had literary ambitions, but I abandoned them long ago.</t1131> <t1132>And now, my young and dear friend, if you allow me to call you that, may I ask if you stand by everything you told us during lunch?</t1132>
<t1133>—I have completely forgotten what I said —smiled Lord Henry—.</t1133> <t1134>Was it so immoral?</t1134>
<t1135>—Extremely immoral.</t1135> <t1136>In fact, I consider him extraordinarily dangerous, and if anything happens to our good duchess, we will hold him directly responsible.</t1136> <t1137>But I would like to talk to you about life.</t1137> <t1138>The generation I am part of is frankly boring.</t1138> <t1139>Someday, when you tire of London, come to Treadley, explain to me your philosophy of pleasure while we enjoy an excellent Burgundy that I am fortunate enough to possess.</t1139>
<t1140>—I will love it.</t1140> <t1141>A visit to Treadley will be a great privilege.</t1141> <t1142>It boasts a perfect host and an equally perfect library.</t1142>
<t1143>—Your presence will add a new charm —replied the elderly gentleman, with a courteous bow—.</t1143> <t1144>And now I must take my leave of your excellent aunt.</t1144> <t1145>I am expected at the Atheneum.</t1145> <t1146>It is the hour when we sleep there.</t1146>
<t1147>—All of them, Mr. Erskine?</t1147>
<t1148>—Forty, in forty armchairs.</t1148> <t1149>We are doing exercises for an English Academy of Letters.</t1149>
<t1150>Lord Henry laughed, standing up.</t1150>
<t1151>—I'm going to the park —he exclaimed.</t1151>
<t1152>As he passed through the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.</t1152>
<t1153>—Allow me to go with you —he murmured.</t1153>
<t1154>—I thought you had promised Basil Hallward that you would go see him —replied Lord Henry.</t1154>
<t1155>—I prefer to go with you; yes, I feel that I must go with you.</t1155> <t1156>Allow me.</t1156> <t1157>And promise to talk to me all the time.</t1157> <t1158>Nobody does it as well as you do.</t1158>
<t1159>—Ah! I have already spoken more than enough for today —said Lord Henry, smiling—.</t1159> <t1160>All I want now is to watch life.</t1160> <t1161>You can come and watch it with me, if you please.</t1161>
<t1162>Chapter 4</t1162>
<t1163>One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious armchair in the small library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.</t1163> <t1164>It was, in its style, a very pleasant room, with high olive-colored oak paneling, a cream-colored frieze, a plaster ceiling, and a brick-colored felt carpet, over which smaller silk Persian rugs with long fringes had been spread.</t1164> <t1165>On a tiny satinwood table, there was a statuette by Clodion and, next to it, a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for Marguerite de Valois by Clovis Eve and adorned with the daisies that the queen had chosen as her emblem.</t1165> <t1166>Some large blue porcelain vases with multicolored tulips occupied the mantelpiece, and through the leaded glass rectangles of the window, the apricot-colored light of a summer day in London poured in.</t1166>
<t1167>Lord Henry had not returned yet.</t1167> <t1168>He was always late on principle, as, in his opinion, punctuality is the thief of time.</t1168> <t1169>So the boy seemed quite sulky as he distractedly flipped through the pages of a sumptuously illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had found on one of the shelves.</t1169> <t1170>The solemn and monotonous ticking of the Louis XIV clock bothered him.</t1170> <t1171>Once or twice he thought about leaving.</t1171>
<t1172>Finally, he heard footsteps outside and the door opened.</t1172>
<t1173>—How late you arrive, Harry! —he murmured.</t1173>
<t1174>—I'm afraid it is not about Harry, Mr. Gray —responded a very sharp voice.</t1174>
<t1175>Dorian quickly turned, standing up.</t1175> <t1176>—I beg your pardon.</t1176> <t1177>I thought...</t1177>
<t1178>—You thought he was my husband.</t1178> <t1179>I am only his wife.</t1179> <t1180>Allow me to introduce myself.</t1180> <t1181>I know you well from your photographs.</t1181> <t1182>I think my husband has seventeen.</t1182>
<t1183>—No, Lady Wotton, not seventeen!</t1183>
<t1184>—Eighteen, then.</t1184> <t1185>And I saw them together the other night at the opera —she laughed nervously as she spoke, gazing at him with her blue, somewhat vague, forget-me-not eyes.</t1185> <t1186>She was a curious woman, whose dresses always gave the impression of having been designed in anger and worn in a storm.</t1186> <t1187>Ordinarily, she was in love with someone, and since her passion was never reciprocated, she had preserved all her illusions.</t1187> <t1188>She tried to achieve a picturesque appearance, but only managed to give an impression of untidiness.</t1188> <t1189>Her name was Victoria and she had the persistent obsession of going to church.</t1189>
<t1190>—It was Lohengrin, if I remember correctly.</t1190>
<t1191>—Yes, it was my dear Lohengrin.</t1191> <t1192>I like Wagner's music more than any other.</t1192> <t1193>It is so loud that you can talk all the time without other people hearing what is being said.</t1193> <t1194>That is a great advantage, don't you think, Mr. Gray?</t1194>
<t1195>The same laugh, nervous and intermittent, escaped from the thin lips, and their fingers began to play with a tortoiseshell letter opener.</t1195>
<t1196>Dorian smiled and shook his head.</t1196>
<t1197>—I'm afraid I don't agree, Lady Wotton.</t1197> <t1198>I never speak when music is playing; at least, if it's good music.</t1198> <t1199>If the music is bad, it is our duty to drown it out with conversation.</t1199>
<t1200>—Ah! That is one of Harry's ideas, isn't it, Mr. Gray?</t1200> <t1201>I always hear Harry's ideas from the lips of his friends.</t1201> <t1202>That's how I find out they exist.</t1202> <t1203>But you mustn't think I don't like good music.</t1203> <t1204>I adore it, but it scares me.</t1204> <t1205>It makes me too romantic.</t1205> <t1206>I simply worship pianists; two at a time, on some occasions, Harry tells me.</t1206> <t1207>I don't know what it is about them.</t1207> <t1208>Perhaps it's that they are foreigners.</t1208> <t1209>They all are, aren't they?</t1209> <t1210>Even those born in England become foreigners over time, don't you think? What skill they have!</t1210> <t1211>And for art, what an excellent compliment!</t1211> <t1212>It makes it extremely cosmopolitan, doesn't it?</t1212> <t1213>Have you never been to one of my parties, Mr. Gray?</t1213> <t1214>You must come.</t1214> <t1215>I can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense with foreigners.</t1215> <t1216>They make the house look so picturesque!</t1216> <t1217>But here is Harry!</t1217> <t1218>Harry, I came looking for you to ask you something, I don't remember what, and I found Mr. Gray.</t1218> <t1219>We've had a very pleasant conversation about music.</t1219> <t1220>We have exactly the same ideas.</t1220> <t1221>No; I think our ideas are completely different.</t1221> <t1222>But he has been the epitome of kindness.</t1222> <t1223>And I am very glad to have met him.</t1223>
<t1224>—Splendid, my love, splendid —said Lord Henry, raising the dark double crescent of his eyebrows and gazing at both with an amused smile.</t1224>
<t1225>—I'm sorry for being late, Dorian.</t1225> <t1226>I went looking for a piece of antique brocade on Wardour Street, and I had to haggle for hours to get it.</t1226> <t1227>These days, people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.</t1227>
<t1228>—I'm afraid I must be going —exclaimed Lady Wotton, breaking an awkward silence with her sudden senseless laughter—.</t1228> <t1229>I have promised to go out in the carriage with the Duchess.</t1229> <t1230>Goodbye, Mr. Gray.</t1230> <t1231>See you later, Harry.</t1231> <t1232>I imagine you are dining out.</t1232> <t1233>So am I.</t1233> <t1234>Perhaps I'll see you at Lady Thornbury's.</t1234>
<t1235>—I imagine so, my dear - Lord Henry closed the door behind her, when, looking like a bird of paradise that had spent the whole night in the rain, she fluttered out of the room, leaving a faint scent of almond cake; then he lit a cigarette and sank into the sofa.</t1235>
<t1236>—Never marry a woman with straw-colored hair, Dorian —he said after blowing a few puffs of smoke.</t1236>
<t1237>—Why, Harry?</t1237>
<t1238>—Because they are very sentimental.</t1238>
<t1239>—But I like sentimental people.</t1239>
<t1240>—Don't get married, Dorian.</t1240> <t1241>Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both end up disappointed.</t1241>
<t1242>—I don't think it's likely that I'll get married, Harry.</t1242> <t1243>I'm too much in love.</t1243> <t1244>That's one of your aphorisms.</t1244> <t1245>I'm putting it into practice, and I'm doing everything you recommend.</t1245>
<t1246>—Who have you fallen in love with? —asked Lord Henry, after a pause.</t1246>
<t1247>—From an actress —said Dorian Gray, blushing.</t1247> <t1248>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t1248>
<t1249>—It's a rather ordinary debut.</t1249>
<t1250>—You wouldn't say that if you saw her, Harry.</t1250>
<t1251>—Who is it?</t1251>
<t1252>—Her name is Sibyl Vane.</t1252>
<t1253>—I've never heard of her.</t1253>
<t1254>—No one has heard.</t1254> <t1255>But everyone will hear someday.</t1255> <t1256>He is a genius.</t1256>
<t1257>—My dear boy, no woman is a genius.</t1257> <t1258>Women are a decorative sex.</t1258> <t1259>They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly.</t1259> <t1260>They represent the triumph of matter over mind, in the same way that men represent the triumph of mind over morals.</t1260>
<t1261>—How can you say such a thing, Harry?</t1261>
<t1262>—My dear Dorian, it is nothing but the truth.</t1262> <t1263>I am analyzing women at the moment, so I must know.</t1263> <t1264>It is not as abstruse a subject as I thought.</t1264> <t1265>I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain ones and those who paint themselves.</t1265> <t1266>The former are very useful.</t1266> <t1267>If you want to gain a reputation as a respectable person, just invite them to dinner.</t1267> <t1268>The other women are extremely charming.</t1268> <t1269>But they make a mistake.</t1269> <t1270>They paint themselves to look young.</t1270> <t1271>Our grandmothers painted themselves to try to speak brilliantly.</t1271> <t1272>Rouge and esprit used to go together.</t1272> <t1273>Now that is over.</t1273> <t1274>As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her daughters, she will be perfectly satisfied.</t1274> <t1275>As for conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and two of them are not received by good society.</t1275> <t1276>Anyway, tell me about your genius.</t1276> <t1277>How long have you known her?</t1277>
<t1278>—Harry, Harry!</t1278> <t1279>Your opinions terrify me.</t1279>
<t1280>—Don't worry about that.</t1280> <t1281>How long have you known her?</t1281>
<t1282>—About three weeks.</t1282>
<t1283>—And, how did you run into her?</t1283>
<t1284>—I'm going to tell you, Harry; but you have to be understanding.</t1284> <t1285>After all, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't met you.</t1285> <t1286>You made me feel a tremendous desire to know everything about life.</t1286> <t1287>For several days after meeting you, something special was pulsing through my veins.</t1287> <t1288>While I was in the park or walking through Piccadilly, I looked at all the people I passed, wondering with tremendous curiosity what their lives were like.</t1288> <t1289>Some people fascinated me.</t1289> <t1290>Others filled me with horror.</t1290> <t1291>Exquisite poisons floated in the air.</t1291> <t1292>I felt a passion for sensations... Well, one afternoon, around seven, I decided to go out in search of some adventure.</t1292> <t1293>I felt that this London of ours, so gray and so monstrous, with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners and its splendid sins, as you once said, had something in store for me.</t1293> <t1294>I imagined a thousand things.</t1294> <t1295>The mere sensation of danger filled me with joy.</t1295> <t1296>I remembered what you had told me that wonderful evening when we dined together for the first time, about the fact that the pursuit of beauty is the true secret of life.</t1296> <t1297>I don't know what I was expecting, but I went out into the street and headed east, soon losing myself in a labyrinth of grimy streets and dark, grassless squares.</t1297> <t1298>Around eight-thirty, I passed by a ridiculous little theater, with bright lights and garish posters.</t1298> <t1299>At the entrance, there was a horrid Jew, with the most exotic waistcoat I have ever seen in my life, smoking a foul-smelling cigar.</t1299> <t1300>His hair fell in greasy curls, and in the middle of a dirty shirt, a huge diamond sparkled.</t1300> <t1301>"A box, milord?" he said when he saw me, and he took off his hat with a fascinatingly servile air.</t1301> <t1302>There was something about him that amused me, Harry.</t1302> <t1303>He was so monstrous!</t1303> <t1304>You're going to laugh at me, I know, but I went in and paid no less than a guinea for a box next to the stage.</t1304> <t1305>To this day, I still don't know why I did it; but if I hadn't, my dear Harry, I would have missed the great love story of my life.</t1305> <t1306>I see you're laughing.</t1306> <t1307>How bad that seems to me!</t1307>
<t1308>—I'm not laughing, Dorian; at least, I'm not laughing at you.</t1308> <t1309>But you shouldn't say it's the great love story of your life.</t1309> <t1310>You should say it's the first.</t1310> <t1311>They will always love you, and you will always be in love with love.</t1311> <t1312>A great passion is the privilege of those who have nothing to do.</t1312> <t1313>That is the only utility of the idle classes of a country.</t1313> <t1314>Don't be afraid.</t1314> <t1315>Exquisite adventures are reserved for you.</t1315> <t1316>This is just the beginning.</t1316>
<t1317>—Do you consider me that superficial? —exclaimed Dorian Gray, very hurt.</t1317>
<t1318>—No; I think you're very profound.</t1318>
<t1319>—What do you mean?</t1319>
<t1320>—My dear boy, people who only love once in their lives are really the superficial ones.</t1320> <t1321>What they call their loyalty and fidelity, I call it the lethargy of routine or lack of imagination.</t1321> <t1322>Fidelity is to the life of emotions what coherence is to the life of the intellect: simply a confession of failure.</t1322> <t1323>Fidelity!</t1323> <t1324>I have to analyze it someday.</t1324> <t1325>The passion for ownership is in it.</t1325> <t1326>There are many things we would get rid of if we weren't afraid that others would pick them up.</t1326> <t1327>But I don't want to interrupt you.</t1327> <t1328>Continue with your story.</t1328>
<t1329>—Well, I found myself sitting in a dreadful little box, with the most vulgar curtain in front of my eyes.</t1329> <t1330>From my discreet hiding place, I set about examining the room.</t1330> <t1331>It was a perfectly tacky place, all cupids and cornucopias, like a fourth-rate wedding cake.</t1331> <t1332>The gallery and the stalls were quite full, but the first two rows of faded seats were completely empty and there were hardly any people in the best seats of the amphitheater.</t1332> <t1333>There were women selling oranges and refreshments, and large quantities of nuts were being consumed.</t1333>
<t1334>—It must have been like in the glorious days of British drama.</t1334>
<t1335>—Precisely, I think, and very depressing.</t1335> <t1336>I was beginning to wonder what the hell I was doing there when I noticed the program.</t1336> <t1337>What play do you think they were performing, Harry?</t1337>
<t1338>—I imagine The Young Idiot or Dumb but Innocent.</t1338> <t1339>Our parents liked that kind of plays, I believe.</t1339> <t1340>The older I get, Dorian, the more convinced I am that what was good enough for our parents is not good enough for us.</t1340> <t1341>In art, as in politics, les grand-péres ont toujours tort.</t1341>
<t1342>—The play was good enough for us, Harry.</t1342><t1343>It was Romeo and Juliet.</t1343><t1344>I must admit that I wasn't too thrilled about the idea of seeing Shakespeare performed in a place like that.</t1344><t1345>But I was interested, nonetheless.</t1345><t1346>I decided to at least watch the first act.</t1346><t1347>There was a dreadful orchestra, led by a young Jew sitting at an out-of-tune piano that almost drove me out of the theater; but finally the curtain rose and the play began.</t1347><t1348>Romeo was a burly gentleman with many years behind him, eyebrows painted with cork black, a hoarse tragic voice, and the silhouette of a beer barrel.</t1348><t1349>Mercutio was almost equally sinister.</t1349><t1350>He was played by a traveling comedian who had added his own jokes to the text and maintained extremely friendly relations with the audience.</t1350><t1351>Both were as grotesque as the set, which looked like it came from a fairground booth.</t1351><t1352>But, Juliet!</t1352><t1353>Imagine a little girl of barely seventeen, with a flower-like face, a Greek-like head with dark brown hair braided, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips like rose petals.</t1353><t1354>The most enchanting creature I had ever seen!</t1354><t1355>Once you told me that pathos didn't move you at all, but that beauty, simple beauty, could fill your eyes with tears.</t1355><t1356>I assure you, Harry, I could hardly see that girl because my eyes were always clouded with tears.</t1356><t1357>And her voice!</t1357><t1358>I've never heard a voice like it.</t1358><t1359>Just a thread at first, with low, melodious notes that seemed to fall one by one into the ear.</t1359><t1360>Then it grew in volume, and sounded like a flute or a distant oboe.</t1360><t1361>In the garden scene, it had all the trembling joy of nightingales when they sing just before dawn.</t1361><t1362>There were moments later when it reached the unrestrained passion of violins.</t1362><t1363>You know perfectly well how much a voice can affect us.</t1363><t1364>Your voice and Sibyl Vane's are two things I will never forget.</t1364><t1365>When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each says something different.</t1365><t1366>I don't know which to follow.</t1366><t1367>Why shouldn't I love her?</t1367><t1368>I love her, Harry.</t1368><t1369>She means everything to me.</t1369><t1370>I go to see her act day after day.</t1370><t1371>One night she is Rosalind and the next Imogen.</t1371><t1372>I've seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, taking poison from her lover's lips.</t1372><t1373>I've watched her cross the Forest of Arden, disguised as a boy, in breeches, doublet, and a delightful cap.</t1373><t1374>She has been the madwoman who appears before a guilty king, giving him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste.</t1374><t1375>She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reed-like neck.</t1375><t1376>I've seen her in all ages and in all costumes.</t1376><t1377>Ordinary women don't stir our imagination.</t1377><t1378>They are anchored in their century.</t1378><t1379>Fascination never transfigures them.</t1379><t1380>You know what's in their heads as easily as if it were their hat.</t1380><t1381>You always find them.</t1381><t1382>There's no mystery in any of them.</t1382><t1383>They go for walks in the park in the morning and chat in the afternoon at tea parties.</t1383><t1384>They have a stereotyped smile and the manners of the moment.</t1384><t1385>They are transparent.</t1385><t1386>But an actress!</t1386><t1387>How different an actress is, Harry!</t1387><t1388>Why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?</t1388>
<t1389>—Because I have loved too many, Dorian.</t1389>
<t1390>—Yes, of course; horrible people with dyed hair and painted faces.</t1390>
<t1391>—Do not disdain dyed hair and painted faces.</t1391> <t1392>Sometimes they have an extraordinary charm —said Lord Henry.</t1392>
<t1393>—Now I wish I hadn't told you anything about Sybil Vane.</t1393>
<t1394>—You couldn't have avoided it, Dorian.</t1394> <t1395>Throughout your life, you will tell me everything you do.</t1395>
<t1396>—You are right, Harry; I think you are correct.</t1396> <t1397>I can't help but tell you things.</t1397> <t1398>You have a curious influence over me.</t1398> <t1399>If I ever committed a crime, I would come to confess it to you.</t1399> <t1400>You would understand.</t1400>
<t1401>—People like you, the whimsical rays of sunshine in life, do not commit crimes.</t1401> <t1402>But, anyway, I am very grateful to you for that compliment.</t1402> <t1403>And now tell me... hand me the matches, like a good boy, thank you...</t1403> <t1404>What are your current relations with Sybil Vane?</t1404>
<t1405>Dorian Gray jumped to his feet, his cheeks flushed and his eyes blazing.</t1405>
<t1406>—Harry! Sybil Vane is sacred!</t1406>
<t1407>—Only sacred things deserve to be touched, Dorian —said Lord Henry, with a strange note of pathos in his voice—.</t1407> <t1408>But why do you have to get angry?</t1408> <t1409>I suppose it will be yours someday.</t1409> <t1410>When you are in love, you start by deceiving yourself and end up deceiving others.</t1410> <t1411>That is what the world calls a love story.</t1411> <t1412>At least, you know her personally, I imagine.</t1412>
<t1413>—Of course I know her.</t1413> <t1414>The first night I was at the theater, the horrible old Jew came to the box after the performance ended and offered to take me backstage and introduce me to her.</t1414> <t1415>He managed to infuriate me, and I told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body lay in Verona, in a marble tomb.</t1415> <t1416>From the look of astonishment he gave me, I think he got the impression that I had drunk too much champagne or something like that.</t1416>
<t1417>—It doesn't surprise me.</t1417>
<t1418>—Then he asked me if I wrote for any newspaper.</t1418> <t1419>I told him that I never read them.</t1419> <t1420>He seemed terribly disappointed to hear that, and he confessed to me that all the theater critics were hostile to him and that they could all be bought.</t1420>
<t1421>—It wouldn't surprise me if you were right about that.</t1421> <t1422>But, on the other hand, judging by the way most of them look, they can't be too expensive.</t1422>
<t1423>—Well; but he seems to think they are beyond his means —laughed Dorian—.</t1423> <t1424>By then, however, they were already turning off the theater lights and I had to leave.</t1424> <t1425>The Jew wanted me to try some cigars which he praised highly.</t1425> <t1426>But I declined his offer.</t1426> <t1427>The next night, I returned, of course.</t1427> <t1428>Upon seeing me, he made a deep bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of the arts.</t1428> <t1429>He is an insufferable being, but Shakespeare is his passion.</t1429> <t1430>He has already told me, visibly proud, that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to "the Bard," as he insists on calling him.</t1430> <t1431>He seems to consider it a badge of honor.</t1431>
<t1432>—It is, my dear Dorian; a true badge of glory.</t1432> <t1433>Most people ruin themselves by investing too much in the prose of life.</t1433> <t1434>To be ruined by poetry is an honor.</t1434> <t1435>When did you first speak with Miss Sybil Vane?</t1435>
<t1436>—The third night.</t1436> <t1437>She had played Rosalind.</t1437> <t1438>It was impossible for me not to go see her.</t1438> <t1439>I had thrown some flowers to her and she looked at me; at least, I imagined she had.</t1439> <t1440>The old Jew insisted.</t1440> <t1441>He was determined to take me backstage, so I agreed.</t1441> <t1442>It's curious that I didn't want to meet her, don't you think?</t1442>
<t1443>—No; it doesn't seem curious to me.</t1443>
<t1444>—Why, my dear Harry?</t1444>
<t1445>—I'll tell you some other time.</t1445> <t1446>Now I want to know more about that girl.</t1446>
<t1447>—Sybil? So shy and so kind!</t1447> <t1448>There is something childlike about her.</t1448> <t1449>She opened her eyes wide with the most sincere astonishment when I told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed to have no awareness of her talent.</t1449> <t1450>I think we were both quite nervous.</t1450> <t1451>The old Jew smiled from the door of the dusty dressing room, saying elaborate phrases about the two of us, while Sybil and I looked at each other like children.</t1451> <t1452>The old man insisted on calling me "mylord," and I had to explain to Sybil that I was nothing of the sort.</t1452> <t1453>She said to me: "You rather look like a prince. I will call you Prince Charming."</t1453>
<t1454>—By my faith, Dorian, Miss Sybil knows how to give compliments.</t1454>
<t1455>—You don't understand, Harry.</t1455> <t1456>She saw me only as a character in a play.</t1456> <t1457>She knows nothing about life.</t1457> <t1458>She lives with her mother, a worn-out and fatigued woman who, in a more or less crimson robe, played Lady Capulet on the first night; a woman who looks like she has seen better days.</t1458>
<t1459>—I know that look.</t1459> <t1460>It depresses me —murmured Lord Henry, examining his rings.</t1460>
<t1461>—The Jew wanted to tell me his story, but I told him I wasn't interested.</t1461>
<t1462>—You were absolutely right.</t1462> <t1463>There is always something infinitely petty in the tragedies of others.</t1463>
<t1464>—Sybil is the only thing that interests me.</t1464> <t1465>What do I care where she came from?</t1465> <t1466>From her little head to her tiny feet, she is absolutely and entirely divine.</t1466> <t1467>Night after night I go to see her perform, and each night she does better than the last.</t1467>
<t1468>—I imagine that's the reason you never have dinner with me anymore.</t1468> <t1469>I thought, and I was right, that perhaps you had some curious love story on your hands.</t1469> <t1470>But it's not exactly what I imagined.</t1470>
<t1471>—My dear Harry, you and I have lunch or dinner together every day; and I have gone to the opera with you several times —said Dorian, opening his eyes wide to show his astonishment.</t1471>
<t1472>—You always arrive terribly late.</t1472>
<t1473>—I can't stop watching Sybil perform —he exclaimed—, even if I only see the first act.</t1473> <t1474>I feel the need for her presence; and when I think of the marvelous soul hidden in that little ivory body, I am filled with wonder.</t1474>
<t1475>—You're having dinner with me tonight, aren't you?</t1475> <t1476>Dorian Gray shook his head.</t1476>
<t1477>—Today she plays Imogen —he replied—, and tomorrow night she will be Juliet.</t1477>
<t1478>—When is Sybil Vane?</t1478>
<t1479>—Never.</t1479>
<t1480>—I congratulate you.</t1480>
<t1481>—How wicked you are!</t1481> <t1482>Sybil is all the great heroines of the world in one.</t1482> <t1483>She is more than a single person.</t1483> <t1484>You laugh, but I repeat to you that she is wonderful.</t1484> <t1485>I love her, and I must make her love me.</t1485> <t1486>You, who know all the secrets of life, tell me how to enchant Sybil Vane so that she loves me.</t1486> <t1487>I wish to make Romeo jealous.</t1487> <t1488>I want all the dead lovers to hear our laughter and be saddened.</t1488> <t1489>I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust, awaken their ashes, and make them suffer.</t1489> <t1490>Heavens, Harry, how I adore her! —he was moving from one side of the room to the other as he spoke.</t1490> <t1491>Red spots, like fever, burned on his cheeks.</t1491> <t1492>He was terribly excited.</t1492>
<t1493>Lord Henry felt a secret pleasure in watching him.</t1493> <t1494>How different he was already from the timid and frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward's studio!</t1494> <t1495>He had matured, producing flowers of scarlet fire.</t1495> <t1496>From its secret hiding place, his soul had come out into the world, and Desire had come to meet it along the way.</t1496>
<t1497>—And, what do you intend to do? —said Lord Henry finally.</t1497>
<t1498>—I want Basil and you to come with me some night to see her perform.</t1498> <t1499>I have no fear of the outcome.</t1499> <t1500>Without a doubt, you will recognize her genius.</t1500> <t1501>Then we must rescue her from the hands of that old Jew.</t1501> <t1502>She is bound to him for three years, at least two years and eight months from now.</t1502> <t1503>I will have to pay him something, of course.</t1503> <t1504>When everything is settled, I will bring her to some theater in the West End and present her as she deserves.</t1504> <t1505>She will drive the world mad as she has driven me mad.</t1505>
<t1506>—That is impossible, my friend!</t1506>
<t1507>—She will do it.</t1507> <t1508>There is not only art in her, consummate art and instinct; she also has personality; and you have often told me that it is personalities, not principles, that move our age.</t1508>
<t1509>—Alright; which night will we go?</t1509>
<t1510>—Let me see.</t1510> <t1511>Today is Tuesday.</t1511> <t1512>Let's meet tomorrow.</t1512> <t1513>Tomorrow she plays Juliet.</t1513>
<t1514>—Agreed.</t1514> <t1515>At the Bristol at eight; I will bring Basil.</t1515> <t1516>—Not at eight, Harry, I beg you.</t1516> <t1517>At six-thirty.</t1517> <t1518>We have to be there before the curtain rises.</t1518> <t1519>You have to see her in the first act, when she meets Romeo.</t1519>
<t1520>—Six thirty!</t1520> <t1521>What a time!</t1521> <t1522>It would be like having a tea-dinner or reading an English novel.</t1522> <t1523>It has to be at seven.</t1523> <t1524>No gentleman dines before seven.</t1524> <t1525>Should I see Basil between now and tomorrow?</t1525> <t1526>Or will it be enough to write to him?</t1526>
<t1527>—Good old Basil!</t1527> <t1528>I haven't laid eyes on him for a week.</t1528> <t1529>I'm very embarrassed because he sent me the painting with a magnificent frame, specially designed by him, and although I'm a bit jealous of the portrait for being a month younger than me, I must admit that it amazes me to see it.</t1529> <t1530>Maybe it's better if you write to him, I don't want to be alone with him.</t1530> <t1531>He says things that annoy me.</t1531> <t1532>He insists on giving me good advice.</t1532>
<t1533>Lord Henry smiled.</t1533>
<t1534>—People love to give away what they need the most.</t1534> <t1535>It is what I call the unfathomable abyss of generosity.</t1535>
<t1536>—No, no; Basil is the best of people, but somewhat prosaic.</t1536> <t1537>I discovered this after meeting you, Harry.</t1537> <t1538>—Basil, my dear boy, puts all his best qualities into his work.</t1538> <t1539>The consequence is that for life he is left with only prejudices, principles, and common sense.</t1539> <t1540>The only charming artists I know are bad artists.</t1540> <t1541>The good ones exist only in what they do and, consequently, are completely uninteresting as people.</t1541> <t1542>A great poet, a truly great poet, is the least poetic of all creatures.</t1542> <t1543>But the lesser poets are absolutely fascinating.</t1543> <t1544>The worse their rhymes, the more picturesque their appearance.</t1544> <t1545>The mere fact of having published a second-rate book of sonnets makes a man absolutely irresistible.</t1545> <t1546>He lives the poetry he is incapable of writing.</t1546> <t1547>The others write the poetry they do not dare to enact.</t1547>
<t1548>—I wonder if it is really so, Harry —said Dorian Gray, pouring a bit of perfume from a large bottle with a golden stopper that was on the table onto his handkerchief—.</t1548> <t1549>It must be, if you say so.</t1549> <t1550>And now I have to leave.</t1550> <t1551>Imogen is waiting for me.</t1551> <t1552>Don't forget about tomorrow.</t1552> <t1553>See you later.</t1553>
<t1554>When Dorian Gray left the room, Lord Henry closed his eyes and began to think.</t1554> <t1555>Certainly, few people had interested him as much as Dorian Gray, although the boy's excessive adoration for another person did not cause him the slightest twinge of annoyance or jealousy.</t1555> <t1556>On the contrary, he liked it.</t1556> <t1557>It made him a more interesting object of study.</t1557> <t1558>He had always been fascinated by the methods of the natural sciences, but not by their usual subject matter, which seemed trivial and unimportant to him.</t1558> <t1559>So he had started by performing vivisection on himself and had ended up doing it to others.</t1559> <t1560>Human life was the only thing that seemed worthy of investigation to him.</t1560> <t1561>Compared to that, nothing else had the slightest value.</t1561> <t1562>Although if one contemplated life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, it was not possible to cover one's face with a crystal mask, nor to prevent the sulfurous vapors from altering the brain and clouding the imagination with monstrous fantasies and deformed dreams.</t1562> <t1563>There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to fall ill with them.</t1563> <t1564>And diseases so strange that it was necessary to suffer from them to understand their nature.</t1564> <t1565>How great, however, was the reward received!</t1565> <t1566>How wonderful the whole world became!</t1566> <t1567>To perceive the peculiar inflexible logic of passion, and the life of the intellect emotionally colored; to observe where they met and where they separated, at what point they functioned in unison and at what point discordances arose: what great pleasure was thus obtained!</t1567> <t1568>What did the price matter?</t1568> <t1569>One never paid too much for sensations.</t1569>
<t1570>He knew perfectly well—and the idea produced a gleam of pleasure in his agate eyes—that thanks to certain words of his, musical words spoken in a musical manner, the soul of Dorian Gray had turned towards that white young girl and had bowed in adoration before her.</t1570> <t1571>To a great extent, that boy was his creation.</t1571> <t1572>He had accelerated his maturity, which was not insignificant.</t1572> <t1573>Ordinary people waited for life to unveil its secrets to them, but for a few, for the chosen ones, life revealed its mysteries before lifting the veil.</t1573> <t1574>This was sometimes a consequence of art, and especially of the art of literature, which deals immediately with passions and intelligence.</t1574> <t1575>But every now and then a complex personality took its place and assumed the functions of art, and was, in fact, in its own way, a true work of art, because, like poetry, sculpture, or painting, life has refined masterpieces.</t1575>
<t1576>Yes; the teenager was precocious.</t1576> <t1577>He was harvesting still in spring.</t1577> <t1578>He had within him the heartbeat and passion of youth, but he was beginning to reflect on it all.</t1578> <t1579>It was delightful to watch him.</t1579> <t1580>With his beautiful face and equally beautiful soul, he was a source of wonder.</t1580> <t1581>It didn't matter how it all ended or how it was destined to end.</t1581> <t1582>He was like one of those charming figures in a parade or a play, whose joys seem very distant to us, but whose sorrows awaken our sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.</t1582>
<t1583>Soul and body, body and soul, how mysterious they were!</t1583> <t1584>There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality.</t1584> <t1585>The senses could be refined and the intelligence degraded.</t1585> <t1586>Who could say where the carnal impulse ceased or the psychic one began?</t1586> <t1587>How superficial were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!</t1587> <t1588>And yet, how difficult it was to take a stance between the assertions of the different schools!</t1588> <t1589>Was the soul a ghost that inhabited the house of sin?</t1589> <t1590>Or did the body truly merge with the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought?</t1590> <t1591>The separation between spirit and matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was also one.</t1591>
<t1592>He began to wonder if psychology would ever become such an exact science that it could reveal to us the very last spring of life.</t1592> <t1593>Meanwhile, we always make mistakes about ourselves and rarely understand others.</t1593> <t1594>Experience lacks ethical value.</t1594> <t1595>It is simply the name men give to their errors.</t1595> <t1596>Generally, moralists consider it a warning, claim for it some ethical efficacy in character formation, and praise it as something that teaches us which path to follow and which abysses to avoid.</t1596> <t1597>But experience lacks determining force.</t1597> <t1598>It has as little active cause as conscience itself.</t1598> <t1599>The only thing it really proves is that our future will be the same as our past, and that the sin we have committed once, and with bitterness, we will repeat many times, and with joy.</t1599>
<t1600>He considered it evident that the experimental method was the only one that would lead him to the scientific analysis of passions; Dorian Gray, for his part, was the ideal subject, and seemed to promise abundant and precious results.</t1600> <t1601>His sudden and foolish love for Sybil Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.</t1601> <t1602>Undoubtedly, curiosity had much to do with it; curiosity and the desire for new experiences; it was not, however, a simple passion but a very complicated one.</t1602> <t1603>What there was in it of purely sensual adolescent instinct had been transformed thanks to the activity of the imagination, transformed into something that to the boy himself seemed far removed from the senses and which was, for that very reason, much more dangerous.</t1603> <t1604>The passions about whose origin one deceives oneself are the ones that most tyrannize.</t1604> <t1605>The motives that are best known have much less force.</t1605> <t1606>How many times it happened that, believing we are experimenting on others, we are actually experimenting on ourselves.</t1606>
<t1607>A knock on the door brought Lord Henry out of that long reverie.</t1607> <t1608>His valet reminded him that he needed to dress for dinner.</t1608> <t1609>He stood up and looked towards the street.</t1609> <t1610>The sunset had turned the tall windows of the houses across the street into golden scarlets.</t1610> <t1611>The glass panes shone like sheets of red-hot metal.</t1611> <t1612>Above, the sky was like a withered rose.</t1612> <t1613>Lord Henry thought of his friend, of that life colored by all the fires of youth, and wondered how it would all end.</t1613>
<t1614>When he returned home, around half past twelve, he saw a telegram on the vestibule table.</t1614> <t1615>Upon opening it, he discovered that it was from Dorian Gray.</t1615> <t1616>It announced that he had become engaged to Miss Sibyl Vane.</t1616>
<t1617>Chapter 5</t1617>
<t1618>—How happy I am, mother! —whispered the girl, hiding her face in the lap of the withered woman, who looked tired, and who, with her back turned to the too-bright light from the window, was sitting in the only armchair that her sordid living room contained—.</t1618> <t1619>I am very happy —she repeated—, and you must be too!</t1619>
<t1620>Mrs. Vane winced in pain and placed her thin, makeup-whitened hands on her daughter's head.</t1620>
<t1621>—Happy! —he repeated like an echo—.</t1621> <t1622>I am only happy when I see you perform.</t1622> <t1623>You should only think about your career.</t1623> <t1624>Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money.</t1624>
<t1625>The girl raised her head and pouted.</t1625>
<t1626>—Money, mother? —he exclaimed—, what importance does money have?</t1626> <t1627>Love is more than money.</t1627>
<t1628>—Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay our debts and to dress James properly.</t1628> <t1629>You must not forget it, Sibyl.</t1629> <t1630>Fifty pounds is a lot.</t1630> <t1631>Mr. Isaacs has been very considerate with us.</t1631>
<t1632>—He is not a gentleman, mother, and I greatly dislike the way he speaks to me —said the girl, standing up and approaching the window.</t1632>
<t1633>—I don't know how we could manage without him —replied the older woman in a whining tone.</t1633>
<t1634>Sibyl moved her head and started to laugh.</t1634>
<t1635>—We no longer need it, mother.</t1635> <t1636>The prince charming now governs our lives —then she paused.</t1636> <t1637>A rose stirred in her blood, setting her cheeks ablaze.</t1637> <t1638>Her breath, quickened, parted the petals of her lips, which trembled.</t1638> <t1639>A southern wind of passion blew over her, moving the delicate folds of her dress—.</t1639> <t1640>I love him —she added simply.</t1640>
<t1641>—Stupid girl! Stupid girl! —was the parrot-like phrase that she received in response.</t1641> <t1642>The movement of some deformed fingers, covered in fake jewels, gave a grotesque character to those words.</t1642>
<t1643>The girl laughed again.</t1643> <t1644>Her voice reflected the joy of a caged bird.</t1644> <t1645>Her eyes picked up the melody and echoed it with their brightness: then they closed for a moment, as if to hide their secret.</t1645> <t1646>When they opened again, they were veiled by the mist of a dream.</t1646>
<t1647>The wisdom of lips that were too thin spoke to her from the worn-out armchair, advising prudence, with quotes from that book on cowardice whose author disguises himself with the name of common sense.</t1647> <t1648>She did not listen.</t1648> <t1649>She was free in the prison of her passion.</t1649> <t1650>Her prince, the prince charming, was with her.</t1650> <t1651>She had called upon memory to reconstruct him.</t1651> <t1652>She sent her soul to find him, and her soul returned with him.</t1652> <t1653>His kiss burned her mouth again.</t1653> <t1654>His breath warmed her eyelids.</t1654>
<t1655>Wisdom then changed its method and spoke of spying and discovering.</t1655> <t1656>That young man could be rich.</t1656> <t1657>If so, one had to think about marriage.</t1657> <t1658>Against Sibyl's ear, the waves of worldly prudence crashed.</t1658> <t1659>The arrows of cunning passed without touching her.</t1659> <t1660>She saw the thin lips move, and smiled.</t1660>
<t1661>Suddenly, she felt the need to speak.</t1661> <t1662>The silence full of words unsettled her.</t1662>
<t1663>—Mother, mother —she exclaimed—, why do you love me so much?</t1663> <t1664>I know that I love you.</t1664> <t1665>I love you because you are the image of what Love itself must be.</t1665> <t1666>But, what does he see in me?</t1666> <t1667>I am not worthy of him.</t1667> <t1668>And yet, although I see myself so far below him, I do not feel humility: I feel pride, a terrible pride, but I cannot explain why.</t1668> <t1669>Mother, did you love my father as I love the blue prince? —the older woman paled under the too-visible powders that smeared her cheeks, and her dry lips trembled in a spasm of pain.</t1669> <t1670>Sibyl ran to her, hugged her neck, and kissed her—.</t1670> <t1671>Forgive me, mother.</t1671> <t1672>I know that talking about my father makes you suffer.</t1672> <t1673>But you suffer because you loved him very much.</t1673> <t1674>Do not be sad.</t1674> <t1675>I am as happy today as you were twenty years ago.</t1675> <t1676>Ah, let me be happy forever!</t1676>
<t1677>—My dear daughter, you are too young to think about falling in love.</t1677> <t1678>Besides, what do you know about that young man?</t1678> <t1679>You don't even know his name.</t1679> <t1680>All of this is very inconvenient and, to be honest, when lames is about to go to Australia and I have so many worries, I must say that you could have shown a bit more consideration.</t1680> <t1681>However, as I have said before, in the case that he is rich... —Mother, mother! Let me be happy!</t1681>
<t1682>Mrs. Vane stared at her and, with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become almost second nature to an actor, embraced her.</t1682><t1683>At that moment, the door opened, and a young man with coarse brown hair entered the room.</t1683><t1684>He was rather stout, had large feet and hands, and moved with a certain clumsiness.</t1684><t1685>He did not possess his sister's delicacy, and it was difficult to discern the close kinship between the two.</t1685><t1686>Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him, and her smile intensified.</t1686><t1687>Mentally, she elevated her son to the status of an audience.</t1687><t1688>She was sure that the tableau was interesting.</t1688>
<t1689>—You could save some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think —said the boy in a tone of gentle reproach.</t1689>
<t1690>—But you don't like being kissed! —exclaimed her sister—.</t1690> <t1691>You've always been a prickly thistle.</t1691>
<t1692>And she ran across the room to hug him.</t1692>
<t1693>James Vane contemplated his sister's face with tenderness.</t1693>
<t1694>—Come with me for a walk, Sibyl.</t1694> <t1695>I don't think I'll ever see this horrible London again.</t1695> <t1696>I'm sure I won't miss it.</t1696>
<t1697>—Don't say such horrible things, my son —murmured Mrs. Vane, resuming, with a sigh, a tawdry piece of theatrical clothing that she began to mend.</t1697> <t1698>It saddened her somewhat that James had not joined the company, which would have increased the theatrical picturesque nature of the situation.</t1698>
<t1699>—Why not, mother?</t1699> <t1700>It's what I feel.</t1700>
<t1701>—It hurts me that you say that, my son.</t1701> <t1702>I haven't lost hope that you will return from Australia after making a fortune.</t1702> <t1703>I believe that good society does not exist in the colonies; at least, nothing of what I consider good society; so when you have succeeded, you should return to London and become a well-known person here.</t1703>
<t1704>—Good society! —murmured the boy—.</t1704> <t1705>I am not interested in good society at all.</t1705> <t1706>I would like to earn some money to get you and Sibyl off the stage.</t1706> <t1707>I abhor the life of the theater.</t1707>
<t1708>—Jim! —exclaimed Sibyl, laughing—, how unkind of you!</t1708> <t1709>Do you really want to take a walk with me?</t1709> <t1710>That's good!</t1710> <t1711>I was afraid you were going to say goodbye to some of your friends..., to Tom Hardy, who gave you that dreadful pipe, or to Ned Langton, who teases you by smoking it.</t1711> <t1712>It touches me that you are giving me your last afternoon.</t1712> <t1713>What shall we do?</t1713> <t1714>Shall we go to the park?</t1714>
<t1715>—I don't have suitable clothes —replied her brother, frowning—.</t1715> <t1716>Only elegant people go to the park.</t1716> <t1717>—Nonsense, Jim —whispered Sibyl, stroking the sleeve of his jacket.</t1717>
<t1718>James hesitated for a moment.</t1718>
<t1719>—Alright —he finally said—, but don't take too long to get dressed.</t1719>
<t1720>Sibyl took a few dance steps to the door.</t1720> <t1721>She was heard singing as she ran up the stairs and then the sound of her feet on the upper floor.</t1721>
<t1722>His brother paced the room two or three times before turning to the motionless figure in the armchair.</t1722>
<t1723>—Are my things ready, mother? —he asked.</t1723>
<t1724>—Everything is ready, James —replied Mrs. Vane without lifting her eyes from her work.</t1724> <t1725>For several months she had felt uncomfortable when she was alone with that coarse and severe son of hers.</t1725> <t1726>She feared revealing her secret frivolity whenever their gazes met.</t1726> <t1727>And she often wondered if James suspected anything.</t1727> <t1728>The silence, because her son made no further comment, became intolerable to her, and she began to complain.</t1728> <t1729>Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack through sudden and strange surrenders—.</t1729> <t1730>I hope you are satisfied with your life at sea —she said—.</t1730> <t1731>Remember that it was you who chose it.</t1731> <t1732>You could have joined a lawyer's office.</t1732> <t1733>Lawyers are very respectable people, and in the provinces, they often dine with the best families.</t1733>
<t1734>—I detest offices and office workers —replied his son—.</t1734> <t1735>But you are absolutely right.</t1735> <t1736>It is I who have chosen to live this way.</t1736> <t1737>I only ask that you take care of Sibyl.</t1737> <t1738>Do not let anything bad happen to her.</t1738> <t1739>You have to take care of her, mother.</t1739>
<t1740>—You speak in a very strange manner, James.</t1740> <t1741>Of course, I will take care of Sibyl.</t1741>
<t1742>—I have been told that there is a gentleman who goes to the theater every night and then chats with her backstage.</t1742> <t1743>Is it true? What about that?</t1743>
<t1744>—You talk about things you don't understand, James.</t1744> <t1745>In our profession, we are used to receiving attentions.</t1745> <t1746>There was a time when I myself received many bouquets of flowers.</t1746> <t1747>Back then, the work of actors was truly appreciated.</t1747> <t1748>As for Sibyl, I don't know if her interest is serious at the moment or not.</t1748> <t1749>But there is no doubt that the young man you mention is a perfect gentleman.</t1749> <t1750>He treats me with extraordinary politeness.</t1750> <t1751>Moreover, he seems to be wealthy, and the flowers he sends are very beautiful.</t1751>
<t1752>—But you don't know what his name is —said the boy harshly.</t1752>
<t1753>—No —responded Mrs. Vane with a serene expression on her face—.</t1753> <t1754>He hasn't revealed his true name yet.</t1754> <t1755>And I find it very romantic.</t1755> <t1756>He is probably an aristocrat.</t1756>
<t1757>James Vane bit his lips.</t1757>
<t1758>—Take care of Sibyl, mother —he exclaimed—.</t1758> <t1759>Take care of her!</t1759>
<t1760>—My son, your words hurt me deeply.</t1760> <t1761>I always take special care of Sibyl.</t1761> <t1762>Of course, if that gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she shouldn't marry him.</t1762> <t1763>I am sure he is an aristocrat.</t1763> <t1764>He has all the appearance, there is no doubt about it.</t1764> <t1765>It would be a very brilliant marriage for Sibyl.</t1765> <t1766>They would make a charming couple.</t1766> <t1767>He is a very handsome young man, everyone notices it.</t1767>
<t1768>The young man murmured something to himself and tapped on the window glass with his worker's fingers.</t1768> <t1769>He had just turned to say something when the door opened and Sibyl entered.</t1769>
<t1770>—How serious you all are! —he exclaimed—.</t1770> <t1771>What is happening?</t1771>
<t1772>—Nothing —replied his brother—.</t1772> <t1773>I suppose sometimes you have to get serious.</t1773> <t1774>See you later, mother; I will have dinner at five.</t1774> <t1775>The luggage is packed, except for the shirts, so you don't have to worry.</t1775>
<t1776>—See you later, my son —she responded, with a resentfully majestic inclination.</t1776>
<t1777>She was very upset with the tone her son had adopted with her, and there was something in his gaze that made her feel afraid.</t1777>
<t1778>—Kiss me, mother —said Sibyl.</t1778> <t1779>Her floral lips touched the withered cheek, warming its frost.</t1779>
<t1780>—My daughter, my daughter! —exclaimed Mrs. Vane, raising her eyes to the ceiling in search of an imaginary amphitheater.</t1780> <t1781>—Come on, Sibyl —said her brother impatiently.</t1781> <t1782>Her mother's theatricality irritated him.</t1782>
<t1783>They went out into a light with reflections agitated by the wind and began to walk along the depressing Euston Road.</t1783> <t1784>The pedestrians looked in astonishment at the burly and sullen young man who, dressed in coarse and unflattering clothes, was accompanied by a young woman so attractive and refined in appearance.</t1784> <t1785>It was like a common gardener walking with a rose.</t1785>
<t1786>Jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive gaze of a stranger.</t1786> <t1787>He felt, in the face of the insistent stares, the displeasure that geniuses only know late in life, and that always accompanies ordinary people.</t1787> <t1788>Sibyl, however, was completely unaware of the effect she caused.</t1788> <t1789>Love trembled on her lips in the form of laughter.</t1789> <t1790>She thought of the blue prince and, to be able to do so more freely, she started to chatter about the ship on which Jim was going to set sail, about the gold he would undoubtedly find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he would save from the evil red-shirted bandits.</t1790> <t1791>Because he would not remain a sailor, or a purser, or whatever it was he did on board.</t1791> <t1792>No, no!</t1792> <t1793>The life of a sailor was dreadful.</t1793> <t1794>How absurd to be confined in a horrible ship that the monstrous crests of the waves tried to invade, while a sinister wind knocked down masts and tore sails until they became long, disheveled, roaring rags.</t1794> <t1795>Without a doubt, Jim would leave the ship in Melbourne, politely bid farewell to the captain, and set off for the goldfields.</t1795> <t1796>Before a week had passed, he would have found a huge nugget, the largest ever discovered, and he would transport it to the coast in a cart protected by six mounted policemen.</t1796> <t1797>The robbers would attack them three times, and they would be repelled with immense losses.</t1797> <t1798>Or better yet, no.</t1798> <t1799>He would not go to the goldfields, which were horrible places where men got drunk and fought with guns in the bars and said foul words.</t1799> <t1800>He would raise sheep and, one night, when he returned home on horseback, upon seeing the beautiful heiress, kidnapped by a thief on a black horse, he would chase them and rescue her.</t1800> <t1801>Of course, the girl would fall in love with him, and he with her, they would marry, return to England, and live in a huge London house.</t1801> <t1802>Yes, wonderful adventures awaited him.</t1802> <t1803>But he had to be very good, and not get angry, nor spend his money foolishly.</t1803> <t1804>Sibyl was only a year older than Jim, but she knew much more about life.</t1804> <t1805>He also had to write to her whenever there was mail, and say his prayers every night before going to bed.</t1805> <t1806>God was very good and would take care of him.</t1806> <t1807>She would also pray for him, and in a very few years, he would return, very rich and very happy.</t1807>
<t1808>The boy listened to her sullenly and made no comment.</t1808> <t1809>His heart broke at the thought of leaving his home.</t1809>
<t1810>But it was not just that which depressed him and put him in a bad mood.</t1810> <t1811>Despite his lack of experience, he was fully aware of the dangers of Sibyl's situation.</t1811> <t1812>That young dandy who was courting her would not bring her happiness.</t1812> <t1813>He was a gentleman and he loathed him for that, with a strange instinctive repugnance that he could not explain and which, for that very reason, was even more compelling.</t1813> <t1814>He was also not blind to the superficiality and vanity of her mother, and he saw in that an infinite danger for Sibyl and her happiness.</t1814> <t1815>Children begin life loving their parents; as they grow older, they judge them, and sometimes they forgive them.</t1815>
<t1816>His mother!</t1816> <t1817>There was something he wanted to ask her that obsessed him, something he had been pondering in silence for many months.</t1817> <t1818>A casual phrase he had heard at the theater, a mocking whisper that reached his ears one night while he waited by the artists' exit, had set off a horrible chain of thoughts.</t1818> <t1819>He remembered it like a whip strike across his face.</t1819> <t1820>He frowned deeply, forming a very deep furrow, and with a painful shudder, he bit his lips.</t1820>
<t1821>—You don't listen to a single word I say, Jim —exclaimed Sibyl—, even though I make the most wonderful plans for your future.</t1821> <t1822>Please do me the favor of talking to me.</t1822>
<t1823>—What do you want me to say?</t1823>
<t1824>—Well, you're going to be a good boy and you won't forget about us —replied his sister, smiling at him.</t1824>
<t1825>Jim shrugged.</t1825>
<t1826>—It will be easier for you to forget me than for me to forget you.</t1826> <t1827>Sibyl blushed.</t1827>
<t1828>—What do you mean? —he asked.</t1828>
<t1829>—You have a new friend, according to what I've heard.</t1829> <t1830>Who is it?</t1830> <t1831>Why haven't you told me about him?</t1831> <t1832>He won't do you any good.</t1832>
<t1833>—Don't continue, Jim! —he exclaimed—.</t1833> <t1834>Don't say anything against him.</t1834> <t1835>I love him.</t1835>
<t1836>—How is it possible!</t1836> <t1837>You don't even know his name —the boy replied—.</t1837> <t1838>Who is he?</t1838> <t1839>I have the right to know.</t1839>
<t1840>—He's called Prince Charming.</t1840> <t1841>Don't you like him?</t1841> <t1842>Come on, don't be silly!</t1842> <t1843>You must never forget him.</t1843> <t1844>If you saw him, you would realize that he is the most wonderful person in the world.</t1844> <t1845>Someday you'll meet him, when you return from Australia.</t1845> <t1846>You will like him a lot.</t1846> <t1847>Everyone likes him; and I... I love him.</t1847> <t1848>I wish you could come to the theater tonight.</t1848> <t1849>He will be there, and I am going to play Juliet.</t1849> <t1850>Ah, how I will perform my role!</t1850> <t1851>Imagine, Jim!</t1851> <t1852>Being in love and playing Juliet!</t1852> <t1853>Having him there, watching me!</t1853> <t1854>Performing to please him!</t1854> <t1855>I'm afraid of scaring the company, of scaring them or captivating them.</t1855> <t1856>To love is to surpass oneself.</t1856> <t1857>That poor and terrible Mr. Isaacs will rave about my talent to the loafers in his bar.</t1857> <t1858>He has preached me as a dogma; tonight he will announce me as a revelation.</t1858> <t1859>I foresee it.</t1859> <t1860>And it is all his, only his, my Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my divine giver of all graces.</t1860> <t1861>But I am poor beside him.</t1861> <t1862>Poor? What does that matter?</t1862> <t1863>If poverty humbly knocks at the door, love enters through the window.</t1863> <t1864>We need to rewrite our proverbs.</t1864> <t1865>They were made in winter, and now we are in summer; spring for me, I think, a dance of rosebuds in a blue sky.</t1865>
<t1866>—He is a gentleman —said the boy resentfully.</t1866>
<t1867>—A prince! —she exclaimed, her voice full of music—.</t1867> <t1868>What more is needed?</t1868>
<t1869>—He wants to enslave you.</t1869>
<t1870>—The idea of being free makes me shudder.</t1870>
<t1871>—Be careful, I beg you.</t1871>
<t1872>—To see him is to adore him, to know him is to trust him.</t1872>
<t1873>—You have lost your mind, Sibyl.</t1873>
<t1874>His sister burst out laughing and took him by the arm.</t1874>
<t1875>—My dear and mature Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred years old.</t1875> <t1876>Someday you too will fall in love.</t1876> <t1877>Then you will know what it's all about.</t1877> <t1878>Don't make that grumpy face.</t1878> <t1879>You should be happy to think that, even though you're leaving, you're leaving me happier than ever.</t1879> <t1880>Life has been hard for the two of us, terribly hard and difficult.</t1880> <t1881>But from now on it will be different.</t1881> <t1882>You are going to a new world, and I have discovered one.</t1882> <t1883>Here are two empty chairs; let's sit down and watch the elegant people go by.</t1883>
<t1884>They sat in the midst of a crowd of idlers.</t1884> <t1885>The tulip beds on the other side of the avenue burned, turned into throbbing rings of fire.</t1885> <t1886>A white dust, it seemed like a trembling cloud of lily dust, floated in the panting air.</t1886> <t1887>The bright-colored parasols rose and fell like giant butterflies.</t1887>
<t1888>Sibyl made her brother talk about himself, his hopes, his plans.</t1888> <t1889>Jim expressed himself slowly and with difficulty.</t1889> <t1890>They passed words to each other like players pass chips.</t1890> <t1891>Sibyl began to feel depressed.</t1891> <t1892>She couldn't convey her joy.</t1892> <t1893>All her efforts only elicited a faint smile at the corners of that stern mouth.</t1893> <t1894>After some time, she stopped talking.</t1894> <t1895>Suddenly, she glimpsed some golden hair and laughing lips: Dorian Gray was passing by in an open carriage with two ladies.</t1895>
<t1896>Sibyl jumped to her feet.</t1896>
<t1897>—There it is! —he exclaimed.</t1897>
<t1898>—Who?</t1898>
<t1899>—My Prince Charming —she replied, following the victory with her eyes.</t1899>
<t1900>Her brother also stood up and grabbed her roughly by the arm.</t1900>
<t1901>—Show it to me.</t1901> <t1902>Who is it? Point them out to me.</t1902> <t1903>I have to see them! —he exclaimed; but at that moment the Duke of Berwick's carriage, drawn by four horses, came between them, and when the horizon cleared again, the other vehicle had left the park.</t1903>
<t1904>—He has gone —murmured Sibyl, saddened—.</t1904> <t1905>I wish you had seen him.</t1905>
<t1906>—I would have liked it too, because as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever hurts you, I will kill him.</t1906>
<t1907>His sister looked at him horrified.</t1907> <t1908>Jim repeated what he had said, and his words cut through the air like a dagger.</t1908> <t1909>The people around him were left open-mouthed.</t1909> <t1910>A lady who was very close by laughed nervously.</t1910>
<t1911>—Let's go, Jim, let's go - Sibyl whispered.</t1911> <t1912>He followed her, undaunted, through the crowd.</t1912> <t1913>He was glad he had said what he had said.</t1913>
<t1914>When they arrived at the statue of Achilles, Sibyl turned to her brother.</t1914> <t1915>The pity in her eyes turned into laughter as it reached her lips.</t1915>
<t1916>—You are crazy, Jim, completely crazy —she said, shaking her head—; a boy with a very bad temper, that's all.</t1916> <t1917>How can you imagine such horrible things?</t1917> <t1918>You don't know what you're saying.</t1918> <t1919>You're simply jealous and very unkind.</t1919> <t1920>I wish you would fall in love!</t1920> <t1921>Love makes people good, and what you said was mean.</t1921>
<t1922>—I am sixteen years old —Jim replied—, and I know what I'm talking about.</t1922> <t1923>Our mother doesn't help you at all.</t1923> <t1924>She doesn't know how to take care of you.</t1924> <t1925>I would rather not have to go to Australia.</t1925> <t1926>I'm about to throw it all away.</t1926> <t1927>I would do it if I hadn't signed the contract.</t1927>
<t1928>—Don't be so serious, Jim.</t1928> <t1929>You're like one of the heroes from those stupid melodramas that our mother loved to perform.</t1929> <t1930>I'm not going to fight with you.</t1930> <t1931>I've seen it and seeing it is perfect happiness.</t1931> <t1932>We won't quarrel.</t1932> <t1933>I know you'll never harm someone I love, will you?</t1933>
<t1934>—No, as long as you still want it, I suppose —was his gruff response.</t1934>
<t1935>—I will love him forever! —exclaimed Sibyl.</t1935>
<t1936>—And him?</t1936>
<t1937>—Always the same!</t1937>
<t1938>—He better.</t1938>
<t1939>Sibyl moved slightly away from him.</t1939> <t1940>Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm.</t1940> <t1941>He was nothing more than a child.</t1941>
<t1942>At Marble Arch, they took a bus that left them near their modest home.</t1942> <t1943>It was past five, and Sibyl had to rest lying down for a couple of hours before the performance.</t1943> <t1944>Jim insisted that she do so.</t1944> <t1945>He said he preferred to say goodbye to her when their mother wasn't present.</t1945> <t1946>She would certainly make a scene, and Jim detested any kind of scene.</t1946>
<t1947>They parted in Sibyl's room.</t1947> <t1948>The boy's heart was dominated by jealousy, and he felt a fierce, murderous hatred against that stranger who, in his opinion, had come between them.</t1948> <t1949>However, when Sibyl threw her arms around his neck and caressed his hair with her fingers, Jim softened and kissed her with sincere affection.</t1949> <t1950>His eyes were full of tears as he went down the stairs.</t1950>
<t1951>His mother was waiting for him downstairs.</t1951> <t1952>She complained about his lack of punctuality when she saw him come in.</t1952> <t1953>Jim did not respond, but he sat down to consume his modest dinner.</t1953> <t1954>Flies buzzed around the table and ran over the slightly dirty tablecloth.</t1954> <t1955>Amid the dull noise of the buses and the clamor of the horse-drawn carriages, he heard the monotonous voice that devoured each of the minutes he had left.</t1955>
<t1956>After some time, he pushed the plate aside and hid his head in his hands.</t1956> <t1957>He was convinced that he had the right to know.</t1957> <t1958>They should have told him earlier if everything had happened as he suspected.</t1958> <t1959>His mother watched him, overcome with fear.</t1959> <t1960>The words came mechanically from her lips.</t1960> <t1961>With her fingers, she twisted a lace handkerchief that was in tatters.</t1961> <t1962>When the wall clock struck six, Jim stood up and headed for the door.</t1962> <t1963>Then he turned, and their eyes met.</t1963> <t1964>In his mother's eyes, he discovered a desperate plea for compassion that filled him with anger.</t1964>
<t1965>—Mother, there is something I need to ask you —he said.</t1965> <t1966>Mrs. Vane's eyes wandered aimlessly around the room, but she did not reply—.</t1966> <t1967>Tell me the truth.</t1967> <t1968>I have the right to know.</t1968> <t1969>Were you married to my father?</t1969>
<t1970>Mrs. Vane let out a deep sigh, a sigh of relief.</t1970> <t1971>The terrible moment, the moment she had feared day and night, for weeks and months, had finally arrived, but she did not feel terror.</t1971> <t1972>To some extent, in fact, it was rather a disappointment.</t1972> <t1973>Such a vulgarly direct question demanded an equally direct answer.</t1973> <t1974>It was not a situation that had been reached gradually.</t1974> <t1975>It was crude.</t1975> <t1976>It made Mrs. Vane think of an unsatisfactory rehearsal.</t1976>
<t1977>—No —she responded, amazed by the harsh simplicity of life.</t1977>
<t1978>—In that case, my father was a scoundrel! —exclaimed the boy, clenching his fists.</t1978>
<t1979>His mother shook her head.</t1979>
<t1980>—I knew he wasn't free.</t1980> <t1981>We loved each other very much.</t1981> <t1982>If he had lived, he would have attended to our needs.</t1982> <t1983>Do not condemn him, my son.</t1983> <t1984>He was your father and a gentleman.</t1984> <t1985>He belonged to an excellent family.</t1985>
<t1986>A curse escaped Jim.</t1986>
<t1987>—I don't care —he exclaimed—, but don't let anything happen to Sibyl...</t1987> <t1988>He's a gentleman, isn't he, the one who's in love with her, or says he is?</t1988> <t1989>From an excellent family, too, I imagine.</t1989>
<t1990>For an instant, Mrs. Vane felt terribly humiliated.</t1990> <t1991>She bowed her head.</t1991> <t1992>She wiped her eyes with trembling hands.</t1992>
<t1993>—Sibyl has a mother —he murmured—; I did not have one.</t1993>
<t1994>The boy was moved.</t1994> <t1995>He went towards her, leaned in, and kissed her.</t1995>
<t1996>—I'm sorry for making you sad by asking about my father —he said—, but I couldn't help it.</t1996> <t1997>I have to go now.</t1997> <t1998>Goodbye.</t1998>
<t1999>Don't forget that now you only have to take care of Sibyl, and believe me when I say that if that man deceives my sister, I will find out who he is, I will find him and I will kill him like a dog, I swear.</t1999>
<t2000>The excessive nature of the threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied it, the melodramatic words, made life regain some of its sparkle for the actress for a moment.</t2000> <t2001>All of that recreated an environment with which she was familiar.</t2001> <t2002>She breathed more freely and for the first time in many months felt true admiration for her son.</t2002> <t2003>She would have liked to continue the scene at the same emotional level, but Jim prevented her.</t2003> <t2004>Trunks had to be brought down, some warm clothing had to be found.</t2004> <t2005>The all-purpose servant of the boarding house was coming in and out incessantly.</t2005> <t2006>The price had to be negotiated with the coachman.</t2006> <t2007>The intensity of the moment was lost in vulgar details.</t2007> <t2008>From the window, Mrs. Vane waved her tattered lace handkerchief with a renewed feeling of disappointment as her son walked away.</t2008> <t2009>She realized that she had missed a great opportunity.</t2009> <t2010>She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate her life would be now that she only had a daughter to care for.</t2010> <t2011>She remembered Jim's phrase, which she had liked.</t2011> <t2012>She said nothing about his threats.</t2012> <t2013>The way he had expressed it had been vigorous and dramatic.</t2013> <t2014>Mrs. Vane had the impression that someday everyone would remember her laughing.</t2014>
<t2015>Chapter 6</t2015>
<t2016>—Have you heard the news?</t2016> <t2017>—asked Lord Henry that night to Hallward when a waiter showed him into the small private room at the Bristol where a dinner for three was prepared.</t2017>
<t2018>—No —replied the artist, handing his hat and coat to the waiter, who proceeded to bow to him—.</t2018> <t2019>What is it about?</t2019> <t2020>Nothing to do with politics, I hope.</t2020> <t2021>I'm not interested.</t2021> <t2022>There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons who deserves a portrait, although many of them would improve by being whitewashed a bit.</t2022>
<t2023>—Dorian Gray is engaged —said Lord Henry, carefully examining his friend as he spoke.</t2023>
<t2024>Hallward started and then frowned.</t2024>
<t2025>—Dorian engaged! —he exclaimed—.</t2025> <t2026>Impossible!</t2026>
<t2027>—It is absolutely true.</t2027>
<t2028>—With whom?</t2028>
<t2029>—With a little-known actress.</t2029>
<t2030>—I can't believe it.</t2030> <t2031>Dorian is too sensible.</t2031> <t2032>—Dorian is too prudent not to do something foolish from time to time, my dear Basil.</t2032>
<t2033>—Getting married is something that can hardly be done from time to time, Harry.</t2033>
<t2034>—Except in the United States —replied Lord Henry languidly—.</t2034> <t2035>But I did not say that he got married.</t2035> <t2036>I said that he got engaged.</t2036> <t2037>There is a big difference.</t2037> <t2038>I clearly remember being married, but I have no recollection of being engaged.</t2038> <t2039>I am inclined to believe that I was never engaged.</t2039>
<t2040>—But think of Dorian's cradle, his position, his wealth.</t2040> <t2041>It would be absurd for him to marry so far below his possibilities.</t2041>
<t2042>—If you really want him to marry the girl, tell him exactly that.</t2042> <t2043>You can be sure that he will do it.</t2043> <t2044>Whenever a man does something perfectly stupid, he does it for the noblest of reasons.</t2044>
<t2045>—I hope the girl is good.</t2045> <t2046>I would not want to see Dorian tied to some horrendous creature that could debase his body and destroy his intelligence.</t2046>
<t2047>—No, no; the girl is better than good..., she is beautiful —murmured Lord Henry, savoring a glass of vermouth with bitter orange juice—.</t2047> <t2048>Dorian says she is beautiful, and he is not usually wrong in such matters.</t2048> <t2049>Your portrait has refined his appreciation of people.</t2049> <t2050>That has been, among other things, one of its excellent results.</t2050> <t2051>We are going to meet her tonight, if that boy does not forget his appointment with us.</t2051>
<t2052>—Are you serious?</t2052>
<t2053>—Completely serious.</t2053> <t2054>I would feel terribly bad if I thought I would ever speak more seriously than I am right now.</t2054>
<t2055>—But do you approve of it, Harry? —asked the painter, pacing the room and biting his lips—.</t2055> <t2056>It's impossible for you to approve of it.</t2056> <t2057>It's just a whim.</t2057>
<t2058>—I no longer approve or disapprove of anything.</t2058> <t2059>It is an absurd attitude towards life.</t2059> <t2060>We are not put in the world to air our moral prejudices.</t2060> <t2061>I never give the slightest importance to what ordinary people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do.</t2061> <t2062>If a personality fascinates me, any mode of expression they choose will seem delightful to me.</t2062> <t2063>Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who plays Juliet and intends to marry her.</t2063> <t2064>Why not?</t2064> <t2065>If he were to marry Messalina, it would not seem less interesting to me.</t2065> <t2066>You know perfectly well that I am not a defender of marriage.</t2066> <t2067>The real drawback of marriage is that it kills selfishness.</t2067> <t2068>And people without selfishness are colorless.</t2068> <t2069>They lack individuality.</t2069> <t2070>Anyway, there are some temperaments that become more complex with marriage.</t2070> <t2071>They retain their selfishness and add many others to it.</t2071> <t2072>They are forced to live more than one life.</t2072> <t2073>They become highly organized people, and organizing one's life very well, I believe, is the object of human existence.</t2073> <t2074>Moreover, every experience has value and, say what you will against marriage, there is no doubt that it is an experience.</t2074> <t2075>I hope that Dorian Gray makes that girl his wife, adores her passionately for six months, and then, suddenly, becomes fascinated by someone else.</t2075> <t2076>It will be a wonderful subject of study.</t2076>
<t2077>—You don't believe a single word of what you say; you know perfectly well that you don't.</t2077> <t2078>If Dorian Gray were to ruin his life, no one would feel it more than you.</t2078> <t2079>You are a much better person than you pretend to be.</t2079>
<t2080>Lord Henry burst out laughing.</t2080>
<t2081>—The reason we like to think well of others is that we are afraid of what might happen to us.</t2081><t2082>The basis of optimism is terror.</t2082><t2083>We think we are generous because we attribute to our neighbor the virtues that can benefit us the most.</t2083><t2084>We praise the banker so that he does not penalize us for being in the red, and we find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he will respect our purse.</t2084><t2085>I believe everything I have said.</t2085><t2086>I deeply despise optimism.</t2086><t2087>As for ruining a life, a life is only ruined when its growth is stopped.</t2087><t2088>If you want to spoil a personality, just reform it.</t2088><t2089>As for marriage, of course it would be foolish, but there are other bonds, much more interesting, between men and women.</t2089><t2090>I am certainly willing to encourage them.</t2090><t2091>They have the charm of being fashionable.</t2091><t2092>But here comes Dorian, who will tell you everything better than I can.</t2092>
<t2093>—Basil, Harry, you both have to congratulate me! —said the young man, impatiently shedding the satin-lined cloak and proceeding to shake hands with his two friends—.</t2093> <t2094>I've never been so happy.</t2094> <t2095>I know it's sudden; everything truly delightful is.</t2095> <t2096>And yet, it seems to me that I haven't sought anything else my entire life —his complexion was flushed with joy and emotion, and he looked remarkably handsome.</t2096>
<t2097>—I hope you are always very happy, Dorian —said Hallward—, but I do not entirely forgive you for not informing me of your engagement.</t2097> <t2098>You have told Harry.</t2098>
<t2099>—And I do not forgive you for being late to dinner —interjected Lord Henry, placing a hand on the boy's shoulder and smiling as he spoke—.</t2099> <t2100>Let's sit down and find out how the new chef is, and then you can explain to us how everything happened.</t2100>
<t2101>—Actually, there isn't much to tell —exclaimed Dorian as the three of them took their seats around the small round table—.</t2101> <t2102>Yesterday, simply, after leaving you, Harry, I got dressed, had dinner at the little Italian restaurant on Rupert Street that you introduced me to, and by eight I was at the theater.</t2102> <t2103>Sibyl was playing Rosalind.</t2103> <t2104>Of course, the set was horrible and the actor playing Orlando was absurd.</t2104> <t2105>Sibyl, on the other hand!</t2105> <t2106>You should have seen her!</t2106> <t2107>When she appeared dressed as a boy, she was absolutely marvelous.</t2107> <t2108>She wore a moss-colored velvet doublet with cinnamon-colored sleeves, brown hose, a lovely green hat with a hawk feather held by a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with matte red.</t2108> <t2109>She had never seemed so exquisite to me.</t2109> <t2110>She had the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine you have in your studio, Basil.</t2110> <t2111>Her hair framing her face like dark leaves around a pale rose.</t2111> <t2112>As for her performance..., well, you're going to see it tonight.</t2112> <t2113>She is, no more no less, a born artist.</t2113> <t2114>I was completely enthralled in my shabby box.</t2114> <t2115>I forgot that I was in London and in the 19th century.</t2115> <t2116>I had gone with my beloved to a forest that no one had ever seen.</t2116> <t2117>When the performance ended, I went backstage and talked to her.</t2117> <t2118>While we were sitting next to each other, a look suddenly appeared in her eyes that I had never seen before.</t2118> <t2119>My lips moved towards hers.</t2119> <t2120>We kissed.</t2120> <t2121>I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment.</t2121> <t2122>It seemed to me that my entire life was concentrated in a perfect point of rosy joy.</t2122> <t2123>Sibyl began to tremble from head to toe, shivering like a white narcissus.</t2123> <t2124>Then she knelt down and kissed my hands.</t2124> <t2125>I understand that I shouldn't be telling you all this, but I can't help it.</t2125> <t2126>Of course, our engagement is a total secret.</t2126> <t2127>Sibyl hasn't even told her mother.</t2127> <t2128>I don't know what my guardians will say.</t2128> <t2129>Lord Radley will undoubtedly be furious.</t2129> <t2130>I don't care.</t2130> <t2131>I'll be of age in less than a year, and then I can do whatever I want.</t2131> <t2132>Isn't it true that I did well by taking my love out of poetry and finding my wife in Shakespeare's plays?</t2132> <t2133>Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear.</t2133> <t2134>Rosalind's arms have embraced me and I have kissed Juliet on the mouth.</t2134>
<t2135>—Yes, Dorian —said Hallward, speaking very slowly—; I suppose you have done well.</t2135>
<t2136>—Have you seen her today? —asked Lord Henry.</t2136>
<t2137>Dorian Gray shook his head.</t2137>
<t2138>—I left her in the Forest of Arden and today I will find her in an orchard in Verona.</t2138>
<t2139>Lord Henry savored his champagne with a contemplative air.</t2139>
<t2140>—At what point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what did she respond?</t2140> <t2141>Perhaps you have completely forgotten.</t2141>
<t2142>—My dear Harry, I did not behave as if it were a business deal, and I did not explicitly make a marriage proposal.</t2142> <t2143>I told her that I loved her and she responded that she was not worthy to be my wife.</t2143> <t2144>That she was not worthy!</t2144> <t2145>When the entire world is nothing to me compared to her!</t2145>
<t2146>—Women are wonderfully practical —murmured Lord Henry—; much more practical than we are.</t2146> <t2147>In situations like that, we often forget to mention the word marriage, but they always remind us.</t2147>
<t2148>Hallward put a hand on his arm.</t2148>
<t2149>—No, Harry.</t2149> <t2150>You have upset Dorian, who is not like other men.</t2150> <t2151>Dorian would never make another person unhappy.</t2151> <t2152>He is too delicate for such a thing.</t2152> <t2153>Lord Henry looked over the table.</t2153>
<t2154>—Dorian is never upset with me —he replied—.</t2154> <t2155>I asked the question for the best of reasons, for the only reason, in truth, that justifies asking any question: simple curiosity.</t2155> <t2156>I maintain the theory that it is always women who propose marriage to us and not we to them.</t2156> <t2157>Except, of course, for people of the middle class.</t2157> <t2158>But the truth is that the middle classes are not modern.</t2158>
<t2159>Dorian Gray laughed and shook his head.</t2159>
<t2160>—You are completely incorrigible, Harry; but I don't mind.</t2160> <t2161>It is impossible to be angry with you.</t2161> <t2162>When you see Sibyl Vane, you will understand that the man who treated her badly would be a heartless, soulless being.</t2162> <t2163>I don't understand how anyone could want to shame the one they love.</t2163> <t2164>And I love Sibyl Vane.</t2164> <t2165>I want to place her on a golden pedestal and see the world revere the woman who is mine.</t2165> <t2166>What is marriage?</t2166> <t2167>An irrevocable promise.</t2167> <t2168>That is why you mock it.</t2168> <t2169>Don't do it!</t2169> <t2170>It is an irrevocable promise that I want to make.</t2170> <t2171>Sibyl's trust makes me faithful, her faith makes me good.</t2171> <t2172>When I am with her, I renounce everything you have taught me.</t2172> <t2173>I become someone different from the one you have known.</t2173> <t2174>I have changed, and the mere act of touching Sibyl Vane's hand makes me forget you and forget your false theories, so fascinating, so poisoned, so delightful.</t2174>
<t2175>—My theories...? —asked Lord Henry, serving himself some salad.</t2175>
<t2176>—Your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories about pleasure.</t2176> <t2177>All your theories, in fact.</t2177>
<t2178>—Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about —replied Lord Henry, carefully enunciating each word with his melodious voice—.</t2178> <t2179>But I am very much afraid that I cannot claim that theory as my own.</t2179> <t2180>It does not belong to me; it belongs to Nature.</t2180> <t2181>Pleasure is Nature's touchstone.</t2181> <t2182>When we are happy, we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.</t2182>
<t2183>—Yes, but what do you mean by good? —exclaimed Basil Hallward.</t2183>
<t2184>—Yes —Dorian agreed, leaning back in his seat and looking at Lord Henry over the thick bouquet of purple irises that occupied the center of the table—, what do you mean by good?</t2184>
<t2185>—To be good is to be in harmony with oneself —replied Lord Henry, touching the delicate foot of the glass with very white and fine fingers—.</t2185> <t2186>There is dissonance when one is forced to be in harmony with others.</t2186> <t2187>One's own life... that is what is important.</t2187> <t2188>As for the lives of our neighbors, if one wants to be a hypocrite or a puritan, we can flaunt our ideas about morality, but in reality, those people are not our concern.</t2188> <t2189>On the other hand, the goals of individualism are the highest.</t2189> <t2190>Modern morality consists in accepting the norms of one's own era.</t2190> <t2191>But I consider that, for a cultured man, accepting the norms of his era is the worst immorality.</t2191>
<t2192>—But, of course, if one lives only for oneself, one must pay a terrible price for it, isn't that right, Harry? —asked the painter.</t2192>
<t2193>—Yes, in these times we are excessively charged for everything.</t2193> <t2194>I have the impression that the true tragedy of the poor is that they cannot afford anything except to give up on themselves.</t2194> <t2195>Beautiful sins, like beautiful objects, are the privilege of the rich.</t2195>
<t2196>—One must pay in ways other than with money.</t2196>
<t2197>—In what ways, Basil?</t2197>
<t2198>—I imagine with remorse, suffering..., well, realizing the degradation.</t2198>
<t2199>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t2199>
<t2200>—My friend, medieval art is charming, but medieval emotions are outdated.</t2200> <t2201>They can be used in novels, of course.</t2201> <t2202>But the things that can be used in narrative are those that have ceased to be used in real life.</t2202> <t2203>Believe me, no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and the uncivilized never come to know what a pleasure is.</t2203>
<t2204>—I know what pleasure is —exclaimed Dorian Gray—.</t2204> <t2205>To adore someone.</t2205>
<t2206>—Undoubtedly that is better than being adored —replied Lord Henry, playing with a fruit—.</t2206> <t2207>Being adored is very annoying.</t2207> <t2208>Women treat us like humanity treats its gods.</t2208> <t2209>They worship us and are always bothering us to do something for them.</t2209>
<t2210>—I would say that anything they ask for has been given to us before —murmured the young man very seriously—.</t2210> <t2211>They create love in our soul.</t2211> <t2212>They have the right to ask for reciprocation.</t2212>
<t2213>—That is completely true —exclaimed Hallward.</t2213>
<t2214>—Nothing is completely certain —said Lord Henry.</t2214>
<t2215>—This is true —Dorian interrupted him—.</t2215> <t2216>You have to admit, Harry, that women give men the very gold of their lives.</t2216>
<t2217>—It's possible -sighed the other—, but inevitably they demand it in small change.</t2217> <t2218>That is the problem.</t2218> <t2219>Women, as a very witty Frenchman once said, awaken in us the desire to produce masterpieces, but then they always prevent us from carrying them out.</t2219>
<t2220>—You're horrible, Harry!</t2220> <t2221>I don't know why I have so much affection for you.</t2221>
<t2222>—You will always have me —replied Lord Henry—.</t2222> <t2223>Will you have coffee?</t2223> <t2224>Waiter, bring coffee, fine champagne, and cigarettes.</t2224> <t2225>No, forget the cigarettes; I have some myself.</t2225> <t2226>Basil, I do not permit you to smoke cigars.</t2226> <t2227>Light a cigarette.</t2227> <t2228>The cigarette is the perfect example of perfect pleasure.</t2228> <t2229>It is exquisite and leaves one unsatisfied.</t2229> <t2230>What more could one ask for?</t2230> <t2231>Yes, Dorian, you will always have affection for me.</t2231> <t2232>I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.</t2232>
<t2233>—What absurd things you say! —exclaimed the boy, using the silver dragon-shaped lighter that the waiter had left on the table.</t2233>
<t2234>—Let's go to the theater.</t2234> <t2235>When Sibyl comes on stage, you will find a new ideal of life.</t2235> <t2236>It will mean something to you that you have never known before.</t2236>
<t2237>—I have known everything —said Lord Henry, with an expression of weariness in his eyes—, but I am always willing to experience a new emotion.</t2237> <t2238>I greatly fear, however, that, at least for me, that is something that does not exist.</t2238> <t2239>Anyway, perhaps your wonderful girl will captivate me.</t2239> <t2240>I love the theater.</t2240> <t2241>It is much more real than life.</t2241> <t2242>Come on, Dorian.</t2242> <t2243>You will come with me.</t2243> <t2244>I'm sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the carriage.</t2244> <t2245>You will have to follow us in a cab.</t2245>
<t2246>They stood up to put on their coats, drinking their coffee while standing.</t2246> <t2247>The painter, worried, had fallen silent.</t2247> <t2248>Melancholy had overtaken him.</t2248> <t2249>He greatly disliked that marriage, although in reality, it seemed better to him than many other things that could have happened.</t2249> <t2250>Very shortly after, they went out into the street.</t2250> <t2251>Hallward headed alone towards the theater, as they had agreed, and was watching the flickering lights of the carriage ahead of him.</t2251> <t2252>He had the strange sensation of having lost something.</t2252> <t2253>He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him what he had been in the past.</t2253> <t2254>Life had come between them...</t2254> <t2255>His eyes filled with darkness, and he saw the crowded, glittering streets through a mist.</t2255> <t2256>When the cab stopped in front of the theater, he had the feeling of having aged several years.</t2256>
<t2257>Chapter 7</t2257>
<t2258>That night, for some reason, the theater was packed, and the fat Jewish impresario who greeted them at the door, smiling tremulously from ear to ear with an unctuous expression, proceeded to escort them to the box with pompous humility, waving his thick bejeweled hands and speaking in a loud voice.</t2258> <t2259>Dorian Gray felt that he disliked him more than ever.</t2259> <t2260>It seemed to him that in coming to seek Miranda, he had encountered Caliban.</t2260> <t2261>Lord Henry, on the other hand, rather liked him.</t2261> <t2262>At least that’s what he said, and he insisted on shaking his hand, assuring him that he was proud to meet the man who had discovered a gem of acting and had ruined himself because of a poet.</t2262> <t2263>Hallward amused himself with the faces in the stalls.</t2263> <t2264>The heat was unbearable, and the enormous lamp burned like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire.</t2264> <t2265>The young men in the gallery had taken off their jackets and vests, hanging them from the railings.</t2265> <t2266>They talked to each other across the theater and shared their oranges with the flashy girls who accompanied them.</t2266> <t2267>Some women laughed in the stalls, with shrill and discordant voices.</t2267> <t2268>From the bar came the sound of bottles being uncorked.</t2268>
<t2269>—What a place to find a goddess! —said Lord Henry.</t2269>
<t2270>—It's true! —responded Dorian Gray—.</t2270> <t2271>But it was here where I found her, and Sibyl is the embodiment of divinity.</t2271> <t2272>When she performs, you will forget everything.</t2272> <t2273>Those vulgar and coarse people, with primitive faces and brutal gestures, transform when Sibyl is on stage.</t2273> <t2274>They fall silent and listen.</t2274> <t2275>They cry and laugh when Sibyl wants them to.</t2275> <t2276>She makes them respond like the strings of a violin.</t2276> <t2277>She spiritualizes them, and you feel that they are made of the same flesh and blood as us.</t2277>
<t2278>—The same flesh and blood as us!</t2278> <t2279>I hope not! —exclaimed Lord Henry, who was observing the occupants of the paradise with his opera glasses.</t2279>
<t2280>—Don't pay attention to him, Dorian —said the painter—.</t2280> <t2281>I do understand what you mean and I am convinced that this girl is as you say.</t2281> <t2282>The woman you love must be wonderful, and any girl who achieves the effect you describe must be splendid and noble.</t2282> <t2283>To spiritualize one's own era..., that is something worthwhile.</t2283> <t2284>If Sibyl is capable of giving a soul to those who have lived without one, if she creates a sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and miserable, if she frees them from their selfishness and lends them tears for sufferings that are not their own, she deserves all your adoration, she deserves the adoration of the entire world.</t2284> <t2285>Your marriage to her is a success.</t2285> <t2286>At first, I didn't believe so, but now I see it differently.</t2286> <t2287>The gods have made Sibyl Vane for you.</t2287> <t2288>Without her, you would have been incomplete.</t2288>
<t2289>—Thank you, Basil —replied Dorian Gray, shaking his hand—.</t2289> <t2290>I knew you would understand me.</t2290> <t2291>Harry is so cynical that he terrifies me.</t2291> <t2292>But here comes the orchestra.</t2292> <t2293>Although dreadful, it only plays for about five minutes.</t2293> <t2294>Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give my whole life, and to whom I have already given all the good that is in me.</t2294>
<t2295>A quarter of an hour later, accompanied by thunderous applause, Sibyl Vane appeared on the stage.</t2295> <t2296>Yes, there was no doubt about her charm; she was, thought Lord Henry, one of the most enchanting creatures he had ever seen.</t2296> <t2297>There was something of a gazelle in her shy grace and her surprised eyes.</t2297> <t2298>A slight blush, like the shadow of a rose in a silver mirror, appeared on her cheeks when she saw the crowded and enthusiastic theater.</t2298> <t2299>She took a few steps back and it seemed that her lips were trembling.</t2299> <t2300>Basil Hallward stood up and began to applaud.</t2300> <t2301>Motionless, as if in a dream, Dorian Gray remained seated, staring at her intently.</t2301> <t2302>Lord Henry examined her with his binoculars and murmured: "Charming, charming."</t2302>
<t2303>The action took place in the lobby of the Capulet house, and Romeo, dressed as a pilgrim, had entered with Mercutio and his friends.</t2303> <t2304>The musicians played a few bars to the best of their abilities and the dance began.</t2304> <t2305>Among the crowd of disheartened and poorly dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a higher world.</t2305> <t2306>Her body swayed, as she danced, like a plant moves within water.</t2306> <t2307>The undulations of her throat were the undulations of a white lily.</t2307> <t2308>Her hands seemed made of serene ivory.</t2308>
<t2309>And yet, she appeared curiously apathetic.</t2309> <t2310>She showed no sign of joy when her eyes fell upon Romeo.</t2310> <t2311>The few words she had to say:</t2311>
<t2312>Good pilgrim, do not reproach so much</t2312>
<t2313>to your hand a fervor so true:</t2313>
<t2314>if pilgrim and saint join hands,</t2314>
<t2315>palm to palm is a kiss from a palm tree grower...</t2315>
<t2316>together with the brief dialogue that follows, were pronounced in a completely artificial manner.</t2316> <t2317>The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone, absolutely false.</t2317> <t2318>The coloration was wrong.</t2318> <t2319>It deprived the verses of life.</t2319> <t2320>It made the passion seem unreal.</t2320>
<t2321>Dorian Gray grew pale as he watched her.</t2321> <t2322>He was bewildered and full of anxiety.</t2322> <t2323>Neither of his two friends dared to say anything.</t2323> <t2324>Sibyl seemed absolutely incompetent to them.</t2324> <t2325>They felt horribly disappointed.</t2325>
<t2326>In any case, they understood that the true test for any Juliet is the balcony scene in the second act.</t2326> <t2327>They would wait for it to arrive.</t2327> <t2328>If she failed there, everything would be over.</t2328>
<t2329>She was charming again when she reappeared in the moonlight.</t2329> <t2330>That could not be denied.</t2330> <t2331>But the forced nature of her performance was unbearable, and it worsened over time.</t2331> <t2332>Her gestures became absurdly artificial.</t2332> <t2333>She excessively emphasized everything she had to say.</t2333> <t2334>The beautiful passage:</t2334>
<t2335>The night hides me with its veil;</t2335>
<t2336>if not, the blush would tint my cheeks</t2336>
<t2337>for what you have heard me say before.</t2337>
<t2338>it was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to recite by a third-rate elocution teacher.</t2338> <t2339>And when she leaned out the balcony and reached the marvelous verses:</t2339>
<t2340>Even though you are my joy,</t2340>
<t2341>I am not pleased with our agreement tonight:</t2341>
<t2342>too abrupt, reckless, sudden,</t2342>
<t2343>just like the lightning, which ceases</t2343>
<t2344>before being able to name it.</t2344> <t2345>Love, good night.</t2345>
<t2346>With the breath of summer, this budding love</t2346>
<t2347>it can give a beautiful flower when we see each other again...</t2347>
<t2348>He said the words as if they were completely meaningless.</t2348> <t2349>It wasn't nervousness.</t2349> <t2350>In fact, far from being nervous, she seemed absolutely in control of herself.</t2350> <t2351>It was simply a misunderstanding, and Sibyl a complete disaster.</t2351>
<t2352>Even the audience in the stalls and the gallery, vulgar and uneducated, had lost interest in the play.</t2352> <t2353>Uncomfortable, they began to talk loudly and whistle.</t2353> <t2354>The Jewish impresario, standing behind the seats of the first amphitheater, was stamping his feet and protesting indignantly.</t2354> <t2355>Only Sibyl remained indifferent.</t2355>
<t2356>At the end of the second act, a storm of whistles erupted.</t2356> <t2357>Lord Henry rose from his seat and put on his overcoat.</t2357>
<t2358>—She is very beautiful, Dorian —he said—, but incapable of acting.</t2358> <t2359>Let's go.</t2359>
<t2360>—I am going to stay until the end —replied the young man, with a tense and bitter voice—.</t2360> <t2361>I am very sorry to have ruined the evening for you.</t2361> <t2362>I apologize to both of you.</t2362>
<t2363>—My dear Dorian, it seems to me that Miss Vane is unwell —interrupted Hallward—.</t2363> <t2364>We will come another night.</t2364>
<t2365>—I wish she were ill —replied Dorian Gray—.</t2365> <t2366>But to me, she simply seemed insensitive and cold.</t2366> <t2367>She has completely changed.</t2367> <t2368>Last night she was a great artist.</t2368> <t2369>Today she is a vulgar, mediocre actress.</t2369>
<t2370>—Don't speak like that about someone you love, Dorian.</t2370> <t2371>Love is more wonderful than art.</t2371>
<t2372>—Both are forms of imitation —pointed out Lord Henry—.</t2372> <t2373>But it would be better if we leave.</t2373> <t2374>You shouldn't stay here any longer, Dorian.</t2374> <t2375>It's not good for the morale to see a bad performance.</t2375> <t2376>Besides, I suppose you wouldn't want your wife to act in the theater.</t2376> <t2377>In that case, what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll?</t2377> <t2378>She is charming, and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting in the theater, it will be a delightful experience.</t2378> <t2379>There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating: those who know absolutely everything and those who know absolutely nothing.</t2379> <t2380>Good heavens, boy, don't put on such a tragic expression!</t2380> <t2381>The secret to preserving youth is not to allow oneself any improper emotion.</t2381> <t2382>Come to the club with Basil and me.</t2382> <t2383>We will smoke cigarettes and drink to celebrate the beauty of Sibyl Vane, who is very beautiful.</t2383> <t2384>What more could you want?</t2384>
<t2385>—Go away, Harry —exclaimed the young man—.</t2385> <t2386>I want to be alone.</t2386> <t2387>And you too, Basil.</t2387> <t2388>Can't you see that my heart is breaking?</t2388>
<t2389>Burning tears welled up in his eyes.</t2389> <t2390>His lips trembled and, moving to the back of the box, he leaned against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.</t2390>
<t2391>—Let's go, Basil —said Lord Henry, with a strange tenderness in his voice.</t2391> <t2392>A moment later, they had disappeared.</t2392>
<t2393>Almost immediately the footlights were lit and the curtain rose for the third act.</t2393> <t2394>Dorian Gray returned to his seat.</t2394> <t2395>He was pale, but proud and indifferent.</t2395> <t2396>The play dragged on, interminable.</t2396> <t2397>Half of the audience left the theater, making noise with their heavy boots and laughing.</t2397> <t2398>The performance had been a total fiasco.</t2398> <t2399>The last act was performed before an almost empty house.</t2399> <t2400>Suppressed laughter and some protests greeted the fall of the final curtain.</t2400>
<t2401>As soon as the play ended, Dorian went backstage to head to the actress's dressing room.</t2401> <t2402>He found Sibyl there, with a triumphant expression on her face and her eyes full of fire.</t2402> <t2403>She was radiant.</t2403> <t2404>She smiled, her lips slightly parted, because of a very personal secret.</t2404>
<t2405>As Dorian entered, the girl looked at him and an expression of infinite joy appeared on her face.</t2405>
<t2406>—How badly I acted tonight, Dorian! —she exclaimed.</t2406> <t2407>—Horribly bad! —he responded, looking at her amazed—.</t2407> <t2408>Awful!</t2408> <t2409>It was terrible.</t2409> <t2410>Are you sick?</t2410> <t2411>You can't imagine what it was like.</t2411> <t2412>You can't imagine how I suffered.</t2412>
<t2413>The girl smiled.</t2413>
<t2414>—Dorian —he replied, caressing the name of his beloved with the prolonged music of his voice, as if it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of his mouth—.</t2414> <t2415>Dorian, you should have understood it.</t2415> <t2416>But now you understand it already, don't you?</t2416>
<t2417>—Understand what? —he asked, angrily.</t2417>
<t2418>—The reason why I did so poorly tonight.</t2418> <t2419>The reason why from now on I will always do poorly.</t2419> <t2420>The reason why I will never perform well again.</t2420>
<t2421>Dorian shrugged.</t2421>
<t2422>—I suppose you are sick.</t2422> <t2423>When you are sick, you shouldn't act.</t2423> <t2424>You make a fool of yourself.</t2424> <t2425>My friends have gotten bored.</t2425> <t2426>I have gotten bored.</t2426>
<t2427>Sibyl seemed not to hear him.</t2427> <t2428>She was transfigured by joy.</t2428> <t2429>Overcome by an ecstasy of happiness.</t2429> <t2430>"Dorian, Dorian," she exclaimed, "before I met you, acting was the only reality of my life.</t2430> <t2431>I lived only for the theater.</t2431> <t2432>I believed that everything that happened in the theater was true.</t2432> <t2433>I was Rosalind one night and Portia another.</t2433> <t2434>Beatrice's joy was my joy, and Cordelia's sorrows were equally mine.</t2434> <t2435>I believed it all.</t2435> <t2436>The common people who worked with me seemed touched by divinity.</t2436> <t2437>The sets were my world.</t2437> <t2438>I only knew shadows, but they seemed real to me.</t2438> <t2439>Then you came, my wonderful love, and freed my soul from its prison.</t2439> <t2440>You taught me what reality is.</t2440> <t2441>Tonight, for the first time in my life, I saw the emptiness, the imposture, the stupidity of the meaningless spectacle in which I participated.</t2441> <t2442>Today, for the first time, I realized that Romeo was horrible, old, and made-up; that the moon over the orchard was a lie, that the sets were vulgar and that the words I spoke were unreal, that they were not mine, not what I wanted to say.</t2442> <t2443>You have brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection.</t2443> <t2444>You have made me understand what love truly is.</t2444> <t2445>My love! My prince charming!</t2445> <t2446>Prince of my life!</t2446> <t2447>I am tired of shadows.</t2447> <t2448>You are more to me than art could ever be.</t2448> <t2449>What do I have to do with the puppets of a play?</t2449> <t2450>When I went on stage tonight, I couldn't understand how I had been left with nothing.</t2450> <t2451>I thought I would give a wonderful performance and suddenly I found I was incapable of acting.</t2451> <t2452>Suddenly I understood what it means to love you.</t2452> <t2453>Knowing it made me happy.</t2453> <t2454>I smiled when I heard the audience protest.</t2454> <t2455>What do they know of a love like ours?</t2455> <t2456>Take me away, Dorian; take me with you to where we can be completely alone.</t2456> <t2457>I abhor the theater.</t2457> <t2458>I know how to imitate a passion I do not feel, but not the one that burns within me like a fire.</t2458> <t2459>Dorian, Dorian, don't you understand what it means?</t2459> <t2460>Even if I could do it, it would be a desecration for me to pretend to be in love.</t2460> <t2461>You have made me see it.</t2461>
<t2462>Dorian let himself fall onto the sofa and avoided looking at her.</t2462>
<t2463>—You have killed my love —she murmured.</t2463>
<t2464>Sibyl looked at him astonished and burst out laughing.</t2464> <t2465>The boy did not respond.</t2465> <t2466>She approached, and with one hand caressed his hair.</t2466> <t2467>Then she knelt down and took his hands, kissing them.</t2467> <t2468>Dorian withdrew them, shivering from a chill.</t2468>
<t2469>Then he jumped to his feet, heading towards the door.</t2469>
<t2470>—Yes —he exclaimed—; you have killed my love.</t2470> <t2471>You were a stimulus for my imagination.</t2471> <t2472>Now you don't even awaken my curiosity.</t2472> <t2473>You have no effect on me.</t2473> <t2474>I loved you because you were wonderful, because you had genius and intelligence, because you made the dreams of great poets real and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art.</t2474> <t2475>You have thrown all that out the window.</t2475> <t2476>You are superficial and stupid.</t2476> <t2477>Good heavens!</t2477> <t2478>How crazy I was to love you!</t2478> <t2479>What a fool I have been!</t2479> <t2480>You no longer mean anything to me.</t2480> <t2481>I will never see you again.</t2481> <t2482>I will never think of you.</t2482> <t2483>I will never mention your name.</t2483> <t2484>You don't realize what you represented to me.</t2484> <t2485>Thinking about it is intolerable to me.</t2485> <t2486>I wish I had never seen you!</t2486> <t2487>You have destroyed the poetry of my life.</t2487> <t2488>How little you know about love if you say it stifles art!</t2488> <t2489>Without art, you are nothing.</t2489> <t2490>I would have made you famous, splendid, dazzling.</t2490> <t2491>The world would have adored you, and you would have carried my name.</t2491> <t2492>But now, what are you?</t2492> <t2493>A third-rate actress with a pretty face.</t2493>
<t2494>Sibyl turned pale and began to tremble.</t2494> <t2495>She clasped her hands tightly and said, in a voice that was almost lost in her throat:</t2495>
<t2496>—You can't be serious, Dorian? —he murmured—.</t2496> <t2497>You're acting.</t2497>
<t2498>—Acting?</t2498> <t2499>I'll leave that to you, since you do it so well —he responded bitterly.</t2499>
<t2500>Rising from where she had knelt and, with a painful expression of sorrow on her face, the girl crossed the room to approach him.</t2500> <t2501>She placed her hand on his arm, looking into his eyes.</t2501> <t2502>Dorian pushed her away violently.</t2502>
<t2503>—Don't touch me! -he shouted.</t2503>
<t2504>A barely audible moan escaped from the Sibyl as she threw herself at his feet, remaining there like a trampled flower.</t2504>
<t2505>—Don't leave me, Dorian! —she whispered—.</t2505> <t2506>I'm sorry I didn't perform my role well.</t2506> <t2507>I was thinking of you the whole time.</t2507> <t2508>But I will try, of course I will try.</t2508> <t2509>It came to me so suddenly..., my love for you.</t2509> <t2510>I think I would never have known if you hadn't kissed me, if we hadn't kissed.</t2510> <t2511>Kiss me again, my love.</t2511> <t2512>Don't walk away from me.</t2512> <t2513>I couldn't bear it.</t2513> <t2514>Don't leave me.</t2514> <t2515>My brother... No; it doesn't matter.</t2515> <t2516>He didn't know what he was saying.</t2516> <t2517>It was a joke...</t2517> <t2518>But you, can't you forgive me for what happened tonight?</t2518> <t2519>I will work very hard and strive to improve.</t2519> <t2520>Don't be cruel to me, because I love you more than anything in the world.</t2520> <t2521>After all, I have only failed to please you once.</t2521> <t2522>But you are absolutely right, Dorian, I should have shown that I am an artist.</t2522> <t2523>What an absurd thing; although, in reality, I couldn't help it.</t2523> <t2524>Don't leave me, please —a fit of passionate sobs seized her.</t2524> <t2525>She curled up on the floor like a wounded creature, and the beautifully shaped lips of Dorian Gray, looking down at her, curved in a gesture of consummate disdain.</t2525> <t2526>The emotions of people one has ceased to love always have something ridiculous about them.</t2526> <t2527>Sibyl Vane seemed absurdly melodramatic to him.</t2527> <t2528>Her tears and sobs annoyed him.</t2528>
<t2529>—I'm leaving —he finally said, with a clear and calm voice—.</t2529> <t2530>I don't want to seem rude, but it will be impossible for me to see you again.</t2530> <t2531>You have disappointed me.</t2531>
<t2532>Sibyl wept in silence, but did not respond; she only crawled to get closer to Dorian.</t2532> <t2533>She extended her hands blindly, giving the impression of searching for him.</t2533> <t2534>The boy turned around and left the room.</t2534> <t2535>A few moments later, he had left the theater.</t2535>
<t2536>He barely knew where he was going.</t2536> <t2537>Later, he remembered wandering through poorly lit streets, having crossed gloomy passages populated with black shadows and unsettling houses.</t2537> <t2538>Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughs had called out to him.</t2538> <t2539>Drunkards with unsteady steps had passed by him, cursing, chattering to themselves like monstrous anthropoids.</t2539> <t2540>He had seen grotesque children huddled in doorways and heard screams and curses coming from melancholy courtyards.</t2540>
<t2541>At the break of dawn, he found himself near Covent Garden.</t2541> <t2542>As the veil of darkness lifted, the sky, reddened by faint glows, emptied itself to become a perfect pearl.</t2542> <t2543>Large carts, filled with swaying lilies, slowly traveled down the gleaming and empty street.</t2543> <t2544>The air filled with the fragrance of flowers, and their beauty seemed to provide him with an analgesic for his pain.</t2544> <t2545>He continued walking to the market and watched as the vehicles were unloaded.</t2545> <t2546>A carter in a white blouse offered him some cherries.</t2546> <t2547>Dorian thanked him and, wondering why the other had refused to accept money in return, began to eat them absentmindedly.</t2547> <t2548>They had been picked at midnight and had the coolness of the moon.</t2548> <t2549>A long line of boys carrying crates of tulips and yellow and red roses paraded before him, making their way through enormous jade-green heaps of vegetables.</t2549> <t2550>Under the grand portico, with its sun-faded gray columns, a flock of ragged girls, bareheaded, waited idly for the auction to end.</t2550> <t2551>Others crowded around the swinging doors of the Piazza café.</t2551> <t2552>The heavy draft horses slipped and struck the rough cobblestones hard, shaking their harnesses with bells.</t2552> <t2553>Some of the drivers slept on piles of sacks.</t2553> <t2554>With their metallic necks and pinkish legs, the pigeons ran back and forth pecking at seeds.</t2554>
<t2555>After some time, Dorian Gray hailed a cab that took him to his house.</t2555> <t2556>Once there, he paused for a moment on the threshold, surveying the silent square with its empty windows, shutters, and fixed-gaze blinds.</t2556> <t2557>The sky had turned into a pure opal, and the rooftops of the houses shone like silver beneath it.</t2557> <t2558>From some chimney on the other side of the square, a thin column of smoke began to rise, soon curling its purple spirals in the pearly air.</t2558>
<t2559>In the enormous Venetian lantern —a golden booty from some ducal gondola— that hung from the ceiling of the great oak-paneled hall, the lights of three burners still burned, resembling slender blue petals with a white fire edge.</t2559> <t2560>He extinguished them and, after throwing his cloak and hat onto the table, crossed the library towards the door of his bedroom, a spacious octagonal room on the ground floor that, given his recent passion for luxury, he had just had decorated to his taste, hanging curious Renaissance tapestries on the walls that had been found stored in a forgotten attic at Selby Royal.</t2560> <t2561>As he turned the door handle, his gaze fell upon the portrait painted by Basil Hallward.</t2561> <t2562>The surprise made him stop.</t2562> <t2563>Then he entered his room without losing the expression of perplexity.</t2563> <t2564>After removing the flower he wore in the buttonhole of his jacket, he seemed to hesitate.</t2564> <t2565>Finally, he returned to the library, approached the painting, and examined it closely.</t2565> <t2566>Illuminated by the scant light beginning to filter through the cream-colored silk blinds, it seemed to him that the face had changed slightly.</t2566> <t2567>The expression seemed different.</t2567> <t2568>It appeared that a touch of cruelty had emerged in the mouth.</t2568> <t2569>It was, without a doubt, something very strange.</t2569>
<t2570>Turning around, he walked towards the window and lifted the blind.</t2570> <t2571>The glow of dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into the dark corners, where they froze, trembling.</t2571> <t2572>But the strange expression that Dorian Gray had noticed on the face of the portrait remained, more intense if possible.</t2572> <t2573>The trembling and burning sunlight revealed the cruel folds around the mouth with the same clarity as if he had looked in a mirror after committing some abominable act.</t2573>
<t2574>Trembling, he took from the table an oval mirror, framed by ivory cupids, one of the many gifts Lord Henry had given him, and cast a quick glance at its bright depths.</t2574> <t2575>No similar wrinkle had deformed his red lips.</t2575> <t2576>What did it mean?</t2576>
<t2577>After rubbing his eyes, he approached the painting and examined it again.</t2577> <t2578>There was no sign of change when he looked at the canvas, and yet, there was no doubt that the expression in the portrait was different.</t2578> <t2579>He had not imagined it.</t2579> <t2580>It was a horribly visible reality.</t2580>
<t2581>Letting himself fall onto a chair, he began to think.</t2581> <t2582>Suddenly, like a flash of lightning, he remembered what he had said in Basil Hallward's studio the day the painter finished the portrait.</t2582> <t2583>Yes; he remembered it perfectly.</t2583> <t2584>He had expressed a foolish wish: that the portrait would age and that he would remain young; that the perfection of his features would stay intact, and that the face on the canvas would bear the weight of his passions and his sins; that the painted image would show the wrinkles of suffering and contemplation, but that he would retain all the delicate brilliance and allure of an adolescence that had just become self-aware.</t2584> <t2585>It was not possible that his wish had been granted.</t2585> <t2586>Things like that didn't happen, they were impossible.</t2586> <t2587>It seemed monstrous even to think of it.</t2587> <t2588>And yet, there was the portrait, with a touch of cruelty in the mouth.</t2588>
<t2589>Cruelty! Had he been cruel?</t2589> <t2590>Sibyl was the one to blame, not him.</t2590> <t2591>He had dreamed of her as a great artist, and believing her to be great, he had given her his love.</t2591> <t2592>But Sibyl had disappointed him, proving to be superficial and unworthy.</t2592> <t2593>And yet, a feeling of infinite sorrow took hold of him, as he remembered her curled up at his feet, sobbing like a little girl.</t2593> <t2594>He recalled how indifferently he had watched her.</t2594> <t2595>Why had nature made him like this?</t2595> <t2596>Why had he been given a soul like that?</t2596> <t2597>But he had also suffered.</t2597> <t2598>During the three terrible hours of the performance, he had lived through centuries of pain, eternities of torture.</t2598> <t2599>His life was worth as much as Sibyl's.</t2599> <t2600>She had mistreated him, although Dorian had inflicted a lasting wound on her.</t2600> <t2601>Women, moreover, were better prepared for pain.</t2601> <t2602>They lived off their emotions.</t2602> <t2603>They only thought about their emotions.</t2603> <t2604>When they took a lover, they had no other goal than to have someone to make scenes with.</t2604> <t2605>Lord Henry had explained it to him, and Lord Henry knew how women were.</t2605> <t2606>What reason was there to worry about Sibyl Vane?</t2606> <t2607>She no longer meant anything to him.</t2607>
<t2608>But, what about the portrait?</t2608> <t2609>What was he going to say about the portrait?</t2609> <t2610>Basil Hallward's canvas contained the secret of his life, it narrated his story.</t2610> <t2611>It had taught him to love his own beauty.</t2611> <t2612>Would it also teach him to loathe his own soul?</t2612> <t2613>Would he ever look at it again?</t2613>
<t2614>No; it was simply an illusion that took advantage of his disoriented senses.</t2614> <t2615>The horrible night past had spawned ghosts.</t2615> <t2616>Suddenly, that tiny scarlet spot that drives men mad had collapsed upon his brain.</t2616> <t2617>The scene had not changed.</t2617> <t2618>It was madness to think so.</t2618>
<t2619>However, the portrait continued to gaze at him, with the beautiful face distorted by a cruel smile.</t2619> <t2620>Its hair shone, bright, under the morning sun.</t2620> <t2621>The blue eyes of the canvas were fixed on his own.</t2621> <t2622>An indescribable feeling of compassion overwhelmed him, but not for himself, rather for that painted image.</t2622> <t2623>It had already changed and would change even more.</t2623> <t2624>The gold would wither into gray.</t2624> <t2625>The roses, red and white, would die.</t2625> <t2626>For every sin he committed, a stain would come to soil and destroy its beauty.</t2626> <t2627>But he would not sin again.</t2627> <t2628>The painting, whether the same or different, would be the visible emblem of his conscience.</t2628> <t2629>He would resist temptation.</t2629> <t2630>He would never see Lord Henry again: at least, he would not listen to those subtly poisonous theories that, in Basil Hallward's garden, had first awakened in him the desire for impossible things.</t2630> <t2631>He would return to Sibyl Vane, ask her for forgiveness, marry her, and strive to love her again.</t2631> <t2632>Yes; it was his duty to do so.</t2632> <t2633>Surely she had suffered more than he had.</t2633> <t2634>Poor girl!</t2634> <t2635>How cruel and selfish he had been!</t2635> <t2636>The fascination she had once caused in him would be reborn.</t2636> <t2637>They would be happy together.</t2637> <t2638>His life with her would be beautiful and pure.</t2638>
<t2639>He got up from the chair and placed a large screen in front of the portrait, shuddering as he gazed at it.</t2639> <t2640>“What a horror!” he murmured, and, approaching the door that led to the garden, he opened it.</t2640> <t2641>As he stepped on the grass, he took a deep breath.</t2641> <t2642>The freshness of the morning air seemed to drive away all his dark passions.</t2642> <t2643>He thought only of Sibyl.</t2643> <t2644>A faint echo of the old love reappeared in his chest.</t2644> <t2645>He repeated her name many times.</t2645> <t2646>The birds singing in the dew-soaked garden seemed to speak of her to the flowers.</t2646>
<t2647>Chapter 8</t2647>
<t2648>It was past noon when he woke up.</t2648> <t2649>His valet had tiptoed into the room several times, wondering what could make his master sleep so late.</t2649> <t2650>Dorian finally rang the bell, and Victor appeared silently with a cup of tea and a pile of letters on a Sévres porcelain tray.</t2650> <t2651>Then he drew back the olive satin curtains, lined with iridescent blue, that covered the three tall windows of the alcove.</t2651>
<t2652>"The gentleman slept very well last night," he said, smiling.</t2652>
<t2653>—What time is it, Victor? —asked Dorian, still half asleep.</t2653>
<t2654>—One fifteen, sir.</t2654>
<t2655>How late it is already!</t2655> <t2656>He sat on the bed and, after taking a few sips of tea, attended to the mail.</t2656> <t2657>One of the letters was from Lord Henry, and it had been delivered by hand in the morning.</t2657> <t2658>Dorian hesitated for a moment and then ended up setting it aside.</t2658> <t2659>He opened the others absentmindedly.</t2659> <t2660>They contained the usual collection of cards, dinner invitations, tickets for private exhibitions, concert programs for charitable purposes, and other similar things that rain down every morning on young people of good society during the season.</t2660> <t2661>There was also a considerable bill for a set of Louis XV silver embossed grooming utensils, a bill that Dorian had not yet dared to forward to his guardians, extraordinarily old-fashioned people, incapable of understanding that we live in an age where certain unnecessary things are our only necessities; he also found several communications, written in very polite terms, from the moneylenders on Jermyn Street, offering to advance him any amount of money without bothersome delays and at very reasonable interest rates.</t2661>
<t2662>After about ten minutes, Dorian got up and, throwing a luxurious Cashmere wool robe with silk embroidery over his shoulders, entered the bathroom with an onyx floor.</t2662> <t2663>The fresh water cleared him after many hours of sleep.</t2663> <t2664>He seemed to have forgotten what had happened the day before.</t2664> <t2665>A vague sensation of having participated in some strange tragedy crossed his mind once or twice, but with the unreality of a dream.</t2665>
<t2666>As soon as he had dressed, he entered the library and sat down to have a light French breakfast, served on a round table next to the open window.</t2666> <t2667>It was a wonderful day.</t2667> <t2668>The warm air seemed laden with spices.</t2668> <t2669>A bee flew in through the window and buzzed around the blue bowl with dragon motifs, filled with yellow roses, that he had in front of him.</t2669> <t2670>Dorian felt perfectly happy.</t2670>
<t2671>Suddenly, his gaze fell upon the screen placed in front of the portrait, and he shuddered.</t2671>
<t2672>—Is the gentleman cold? —asked the valet, placing an omelet on the small table—.</t2672> <t2673>Shall I close the window?</t2673>
<t2674>Dorian shook his head.</t2674>
<t2675>—I'm not cold —he murmured.</t2675>
<t2676>Was everything he remembered true?</t2676> <t2677>Had the portrait really changed?</t2677> <t2678>Or had his imagination made him see an evil expression where there was only a joyful gesture?</t2678> <t2679>It was impossible for a canvas to change.</t2679> <t2680>Absurd.</t2680> <t2681>It would be an excellent story to tell Basil someday.</t2681> <t2682>It would make him smile.</t2682>
<t2683>However, how precise the memory was!</t2683> <t2684>First in the confusing twilight and then in the luminous dawn, he had seen the touch of cruelty in the contracted lips.</t2684> <t2685>He almost feared the moment when the servant would leave the library.</t2685> <t2686>He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait.</t2686> <t2687>He was afraid to face the certainty.</t2687> <t2688>When, after bringing the coffee and cigarettes, Victor turned to leave, Dorian felt an absurd desire to tell him to stay.</t2688> <t2689>As the door closed behind him, he called out to him.</t2689> <t2690>Victor stopped, waiting for instructions.</t2690> <t2691>Dorian stared at him for a few moments.</t2691>
<t2692>—I'm not available for anyone —he said, accompanying the words with a sigh.</t2692>
<t2693>Victor nodded and disappeared.</t2693>
<t2694>Dorian then rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and let himself fall onto an extraordinarily comfortable divan situated in front of the screen.</t2694> <t2695>The screen was old, made of gilded Spanish leather, stamped with an overly florid Louis XIV design.</t2695> <t2696>Dorian examined it with curiosity, wondering if it had ever hidden the secret of a life.</t2696>
<t2697>Did he really have to put it away, after all?</t2697> <t2698>Why not leave it where it was?</t2698> <t2699>What was the use of knowing the truth?</t2699> <t2700>If it turned out to be true, it was terrible.</t2700> <t2701>If not, why worry?</t2701> <t2702>But, what if, by some fatality or an even more terrible chance, other eyes had looked behind the screen, witnessing the horrible change?</t2702> <t2703>What would he do if Basil Hallward showed up and asked to see the painting?</t2703> <t2704>It was certain that Basil would eventually do something like that.</t2704> <t2705>No; he had to examine the portrait, and do it immediately.</t2705> <t2706>Anything was better than that dreadful doubt.</t2706>
<t2707>He got up and locked the two doors.</t2707> <t2708>At least he would be alone while he contemplated the mask of his shame.</t2708> <t2709>Then he moved the screen and saw himself face to face.</t2709> <t2710>It was completely true.</t2710> <t2711>The portrait had changed.</t2711>
<t2712>As he would frequently recall later, and always with notable astonishment, he found himself looking at the portrait with a feeling that was almost of scientific curiosity.</t2712> <t2713>That such a change could have occurred seemed incredible to him.</t2713> <t2714>And yet, it was a fact.</t2714> <t2715>Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms, which turned into form and color on the canvas, and the soul that inhabited the interior of his body?</t2715> <t2716>Could it be that what the soul thought, they made real?</t2716> <t2717>That they gave substance to what he dreamed?</t2717> <t2718>Or was there some other, more terrible reason?</t2718> <t2719>He shuddered, felt fear, and, returning to the divan, lay down on it, contemplating the portrait overwhelmed with horror.</t2719>
<t2720>He understood, however, that the painting had done something for him.</t2720> <t2721>It had allowed him to understand how unjust, how cruel he had been to Sibyl Vane.</t2721> <t2722>It was not too late to make amends for that wrong.</t2722> <t2723>She could still be his wife.</t2723> <t2724>The selfish and unreal love he had felt would give way to a higher feeling, it would transform into a nobler passion, and the portrait painted by Basil Hallward would be his guide for life, it would be for him what sanctity is for some, conscience for others, and the fear of God for all.</t2724> <t2725>There were narcotics for remorse, drugs that silenced the moral sense and made it sleep.</t2725> <t2726>But there in front of him was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin.</t2726> <t2727>An incontestable proof of the ruin that men cause in their soul.</t2727>
<t2728>The clock struck three in the afternoon, then four, and the half-hour chimed its double carillon, but Dorian Gray did not move.</t2728> <t2729>He tried to gather the scarlet threads of life and weave them following a pattern; to find a path, lost as he was in a labyrinth of unbridled passions.</t2729> <t2730>He did not know what to do, nor what to think.</t2730> <t2731>Finally, he returned to the table and wrote a fervent letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.</t2731> <t2732>He filled sheet after sheet with tormented words of regret and even more pathetic ones of pain.</t2732> <t2733>There is a voluptuousness in self-reproach.</t2733> <t2734>When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has the right to do so.</t2734> <t2735>It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.</t2735> <t2736>When Dorian finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.</t2736>
<t2737>Suddenly, there was a knock at the door, and he heard Lord Henry's voice outside.</t2737>
<t2738>—Dorian, my friend.</t2738> <t2739>I must see you.</t2739> <t2740>Let me in right now.</t2740> <t2741>It is unacceptable for you to lock yourself up like this.</t2741> <t2742>At first, he did not respond, completely immobilized.</t2742> <t2743>But the knocks on the door continued, becoming more insistent.</t2743> <t2744>Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in and explain the new life he had decided to lead, argue with him if necessary, distance himself from him if separation was inevitable.</t2744> <t2745>Jumping to his feet, he hurried to move the screen to hide the painting, and then proceeded to open the door.</t2745>
<t2746>—I am very sorry for everything that has happened, Dorian —said Lord Henry as he entered—.</t2746> <t2747>But you must not think too much about it.</t2747>
<t2748>—Are you referring to Sibyl Vane? —asked the young man.</t2748>
<t2749>—Yes, of course —replied Lord Henry, dropping into a chair and slowly removing his yellow gloves—.</t2749> <t2750>It is horrible, from a certain point of view, but it is not your fault.</t2750> <t2751>Tell me, did you go to see her after the play was over?</t2751>
<t2752>—Yes.</t2752>
<t2753>—I was convinced that it had been that way.</t2753> <t2754>Did you make a scene?</t2754>
<t2755>—I was brutal, Harry, terribly brutal.</t2755> <t2756>But now everything is resolved.</t2756> <t2757>I don't regret what happened.</t2757> <t2758>It has taught me to know myself better.</t2758>
<t2759>—Ah, Dorian, how glad I am that you are taking it this way!</t2759> <t2760>I feared finding you sunk in remorse and tearing at that lovely hair of yours.</t2760>
<t2761>—I have overcome all that —said Dorian, shaking his head and smiling—.</t2761> <t2762>Now I am completely happy.</t2762> <t2763>I know what conscience is, to begin with.</t2763> <t2764>It is not what you told me it was.</t2764> <t2765>It is the most divine thing within us.</t2765> <t2766>Do not mock, Harry, do not do it again..., at least, not in front of me.</t2766> <t2767>I want to be good.</t2767> <t2768>I cannot bear the idea of the ugliness of my soul.</t2768>
<t2769>—A charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian!</t2769> <t2770>I congratulate you on that.</t2770> <t2771>But how do you propose to start?</t2771>
<t2772>—Marrying Sibyl Vane.</t2772>
<t2773>—Marrying Sibyl Vane! —exclaimed Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him with infinite astonishment—.</t2773> <t2774>But, my dear Dorian...</t2774>
<t2775>—Yes, Harry, I know what you're going to tell me.</t2775> <t2776>Something terrible about marriage.</t2776> <t2777>Don't say it.</t2777> <t2778>Don't tell me things like that again.</t2778> <t2779>Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me.</t2779> <t2780>I'm not going to break my word.</t2780> <t2781>She will be my wife!</t2781> <t2782>—Your wife...?</t2782> <t2783>Haven't you received my letter?</t2783> <t2784>I wrote to you this morning, and I sent the note with my servant.</t2784>
<t2785>—Your letter? Ah, yes, now I remember.</t2785> <t2786>I haven't read it yet, Harry.</t2786> <t2787>I was afraid there might be something in it that would upset me.</t2787> <t2788>You cut life into pieces with your epigrams.</t2788>
<t2789>—So, you don't know anything?</t2789>
<t2790>—What do you mean?</t2790>
<t2791>Lord Henry crossed the room and, sitting down next to Dorian Gray, took both his hands, squeezing them tightly.</t2791>
<t2792>—Dorian... —he said—, my letter..., don't be frightened..., it was to tell you that Sibyl Vane has died.</t2792>
<t2793>A cry of pain escaped from the boy's lips, who stood up abruptly, freeing his hands from Lord Henry's grip.</t2793>
<t2794>—Dead! Sibyl dead! It’s not true!</t2794> <t2795>It’s a dreadful lie!</t2795> <t2796>How dare you say such a thing?</t2796>
<t2797>—It is completely true, Dorian —said Lord Henry, with great seriousness—.</t2797> <t2798>You will find it in all the morning newspapers.</t2798> <t2799>I wrote to you to ask you not to receive anyone until I arrived.</t2799> <t2800>There will be an investigation, of course, but you must not get involved in it.</t2800> <t2801>In Paris, things like that make a man fashionable.</t2801> <t2802>But in London, people have many prejudices.</t2802> <t2803>Here it is unthinkable to debut with a scandal.</t2803> <t2804>That must be reserved to add interest to old age.</t2804> <t2805>I imagine that in the theater they don't know your name.</t2805> <t2806>If that is the case, there is no problem.</t2806> <t2807>Did anyone see you heading towards her dressing room?</t2807> <t2808>That is important.</t2808>
<t2809>Dorian took a few moments to answer.</t2809> <t2810>He was stunned by the horror.</t2810>
<t2811>—Have you spoken about an investigation? —he finally stammered with a choked voice—.</t2811> <t2812>What do you mean by that? Has Sibyl...?</t2812> <t2813>It's more than I can bear, Harry!</t2813> <t2814>But speak quickly.</t2814> <t2815>Tell me everything immediately.</t2815>
<t2816>—I am convinced that it was not an accident, although we need to make the public opinion see it that way.</t2816> <t2817>It seems that when she was leaving the theater with her mother, around half past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten something upstairs.</t2817> <t2818>They waited for her for some time, but she did not return.</t2818> <t2819>Finally, they found her dead, lying on the floor of her dressing room.</t2819> <t2820>She had swallowed something by mistake, some terrible thing they use in theaters.</t2820> <t2821>I don't know what it was, but it had prussic acid or lead carbonate.</t2821> <t2822>I imagine it was prussic acid, because she seems to have died instantly.</t2822>
<t2823>—What an atrocious thing, Harry! —exclaimed the young man.</t2823> <t2824>—Yes, truly tragic, of course, but you must not get involved in it.</t2824> <t2825>I saw in the Standard that she was seventeen years old.</t2825> <t2826>I would have thought her even younger.</t2826> <t2827>She had such a childlike appearance and seemed like such an inexperienced actress!</t2827> <t2828>Dorian, you must not let this matter upset your nerves.</t2828> <t2829>You will dine with me and then we will go to the opera.</t2829> <t2830>Patti is singing tonight and everyone will be there.</t2830> <t2831>You can come to my sister's box.</t2831> <t2832>She will be there with some very elegant friends.</t2832>
<t2833>—So I have murdered Sibyl Vane —said Dorian Gray, speaking half to himself—; as if I had cut her throat with a knife.</t2833> <t2834>But the roses are no less beautiful for it.</t2834> <t2835>Nor do the birds sing with less joy in my garden.</t2835> <t2836>And tonight I will dine with you, and then we will go to the opera and I suppose we will end the evening somewhere else.</t2836> <t2837>How extraordinarily dramatic life is!</t2837> <t2838>If I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think it would have made me cry.</t2838> <t2839>However, now that it has really happened, and that it has happened to me, it seems too marvelous to shed tears over.</t2839> <t2840>Here is the first passionate love letter I have ever written in my life.</t2840> <t2841>It is very strange that my first love letter is addressed to a dead girl.</t2841> <t2842>Do those white silent beings we call the dead have feelings, I wonder?</t2842> <t2843>Can Sibyl feel, understand, or hear?</t2843> <t2844>Ah, Harry, how I loved her just a short while ago!</t2844> <t2845>But now it seems like years have passed.</t2845> <t2846>She was everything to me.</t2846> <t2847>Then came that horrible night, was it yesterday?, when she acted so dreadfully bad and my heart almost broke.</t2847> <t2848>She explained everything to me.</t2848> <t2849>It was terribly pathetic.</t2849> <t2850>But it did not move me in the least.</t2850> <t2851>She seemed a superficial person to me.</t2851> <t2852>Although something has happened since that has frightened me.</t2852> <t2853>I can't tell you what, but it has been terrible.</t2853> <t2854>And I decided to go back to Sibyl.</t2854> <t2855>I realized that I had treated her badly.</t2855> <t2856>And now she is dead.</t2856> <t2857>Good heavens, Harry!</t2857> <t2858>What am I going to do?</t2858> <t2859>You don't know what danger I am in, and there is nothing that can keep me on the right path.</t2859> <t2860>Sibyl would have managed it.</t2860> <t2861>She had no right to take her own life.</t2861> <t2862>She has behaved in a very selfish manner.</t2862>
<t2863>—My dear Dorian —replied Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his cigarette case and then a gold-plated matchbox—, the only way for a woman to reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all interest in life.</t2863> <t2864>If you had married that girl, you would have been very unhappy.</t2864> <t2865>Of course, you would have treated her kindly.</t2865> <t2866>One can always be kind to people one doesn't care about at all.</t2866> <t2867>But she would have soon discovered that you only felt indifference towards her.</t2867> <t2868>And when a woman discovers that about her husband, she either starts dressing very poorly or wears very elegant hats that another woman's husband has to pay for.</t2868> <t2869>And I'm not talking about the social faux pas, which would have been regrettable, and which, of course, I would not have allowed, but I assure you that, in any case, the matter would have been a failure from start to finish.</t2869>
<t2870>—I suppose so —murmured the boy, pacing around the room, horribly pale—.</t2870> <t2871>But I thought it was my duty.</t2871> <t2872>It is not my fault that this dreadful tragedy prevents me from acting correctly.</t2872> <t2873>I remember you once said that there is a fatality tied to good resolutions, and that is they always come too late.</t2873> <t2874>Mine certainly do.</t2874>
<t2875>—Good resolutions are futile attempts to modify scientific laws.</t2875> <t2876>They have no other origin than vanity.</t2876> <t2877>And the result is absolutely null.</t2877> <t2878>From time to time they provide us with some of those sumptuous sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak.</t2878> <t2879>That is the best that can be said of them.</t2879> <t2880>They are checks that must be cashed from an account with no funds.</t2880>
<t2881>—Harry —exclaimed Dorian Gray, approaching and sitting next to him—, why don't I feel this tragedy with the intensity I would like?</t2881> <t2882>I don't think I lack heart.</t2882> <t2883>What do you think?</t2883>
<t2884>—You have done too many foolish things over the last fortnight to be accused of that, Dorian —replied Lord Henry, with his sweet, melancholic smile.</t2884>
<t2885>The boy frowned.</t2885>
<t2886>—I don't like that explanation, Harry —he replied—, but I'm glad you don't judge me as heartless.</t2886> <t2887>It's not true.</t2887> <t2888>I know I have one.</t2888> <t2889>And yet I must admit that what has happened does not affect me as it should.</t2889> <t2890>It simply seems to me a wonderful ending to a marvelous play.</t2890> <t2891>It has the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I played a very prominent role, but which has left me unscathed.</t2891>
<t2892>—It is an interesting case —said Lord Henry, who found a subtle pleasure in playing with the unconscious selfishness of his young friend—; a most interesting case.</t2892> <t2893>I believe the true explanation is this: it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an unartistic manner that they wound us by the rawness of their violence, by their absolute incoherence, their absurd lack of meaning, their complete lack of style.</t2893> <t2894>They affect us as vulgarity does.</t2894> <t2895>They only leave us with an impression of brute force, and we rebel against that.</t2895> <t2896>Sometimes, however, a tragedy crosses our lives that possesses elements of artistic beauty.</t2896> <t2897>If those elements of beauty are real, the entire ensemble appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.</t2897> <t2898>Suddenly we discover that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play.</t2898> <t2899>Or rather that we are both things.</t2899> <t2900>We observe ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle seduces us.</t2900> <t2901>In the present case, what has really happened?</t2901> <t2902>Someone has killed themselves for love of you.</t2902> <t2903>I would have liked to have had such an experience once.</t2903> <t2904>It would have made me fall in love with love for the rest of my life.</t2904> <t2905>The people who have adored me (there have not been many, but a few), have always insisted on continuing to live after I stopped loving them and they stopped loving me.</t2905> <t2906>They have become corpulent and tedious, and when I meet them, they immediately dive into memories.</t2906> <t2907>Ah, that terrible memory of women!</t2907> <t2908>What a dreadful thing!</t2908> <t2909>And what total intellectual stagnation it reveals!</t2909> <t2910>One should absorb the colors of life, but never remember the details.</t2910> <t2911>The details are always vulgar.</t2911>
<t2912>—I must plant poppies in the garden —sighed Dorian.</t2912>
<t2913>—No need —replied his friend—.</t2913> <t2914>Life always distributes poppies by the handful.</t2914> <t2915>Of course, from time to time things get prolonged.</t2915> <t2916>On one occasion, I wore nothing but violets for an entire season, as an artistic mourning for a love story that refused to die.</t2916> <t2917>In the end, it finally did.</t2917> <t2918>I no longer remember what killed it.</t2918> <t2919>Probably, her proposal to sacrifice the entire world for me.</t2919> <t2920>That is always a terrible moment.</t2920> <t2921>It fills one with the terror of eternity.</t2921> <t2922>Well, would you believe it? Last week, at Lady Hampshire's house, I found myself dining next to the lady I am telling you about, and she insisted on revisiting the entire story, unearthing the past and stirring up the future.</t2922> <t2923>I had buried my love under a bed of asphodels.</t2923> <t2924>She brought it back to light, assuring me that I had ruined her life.</t2924> <t2925>I must point out that she proceeded to devour a very copious dinner, so I felt no anxiety whatsoever.</t2925> <t2926>But, what a lack of good taste on her part!</t2926> <t2927>The only charm of the past is that it is the past.</t2927> <t2928>But women never realize that the curtain has fallen.</t2928> <t2929>They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the play loses interest, they suggest continuing it.</t2929> <t2930>If they were allowed to have their way, all comedies would end in tragedy, and all tragedies would culminate in farce.</t2930> <t2931>They are charmingly artificial, but they lack artistic sense.</t2931> <t2932>You have been luckier than I.</t2932> <t2933>I assure you that none of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane has done for you.</t2933> <t2934>Ordinary women always console themselves.</t2934> <t2935>Some turn to sentimental colors.</t2935> <t2936>Never trust a woman who dresses in mauve, whatever her age, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons.</t2936> <t2937>That always means they have a past.</t2937> <t2938>Others console themselves by suddenly discovering the excellent qualities of their husbands.</t2938> <t2939>They flaunt their marital happiness in your face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins.</t2939> <t2940>Some console themselves with religion, whose mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, as a woman once told me; and I understand it perfectly.</t2940> <t2941>Besides, nothing makes one as vain as being accused of being a sinner.</t2941> <t2942>Conscience makes us all selfish.</t2942> <t2943>Yes; the consolations that women find in modern life are innumerable.</t2943> <t2944>And, in fact, I have not yet mentioned the most important one.</t2944>
<t2945>—Which one is it, Harry? —asked the boy absentmindedly.</t2945>
<t2946>—Oh, the most obvious consolation.</t2946> <t2947>The one that consists in seizing another's admirer when one loses their own.</t2947> <t2948>In good society, that always rehabilitates a woman.</t2948> <t2949>But, really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from the women we usually know!</t2949> <t2950>There is something that seems very beautiful to me about her death.</t2950> <t2951>I am glad to live in a century where such wonders occur.</t2951> <t2952>They make one believe in the reality of things we all play with, like romance, passion, and love.</t2952>
<t2953>—I have been horribly cruel to her.</t2953> <t2954>You are forgetting it.</t2954>
<t2955>—I very much fear that women appreciate cruelty, pure and simple cruelty, more than anything else.</t2955> <t2956>They have wonderfully primitive instincts.</t2956> <t2957>We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves in search of a master.</t2957> <t2958>They love to be dominated.</t2958> <t2959>I am sure you were splendid.</t2959> <t2960>I have never seen you truly angry, although I can imagine how delightful you must have looked.</t2960> <t2961>And, after all, the day before yesterday you told me something that seemed purely whimsical at the time, but now I consider absolutely true and that holds the key to everything that happened.</t2961>
<t2962>—What was that, Harry?</t2962>
<t2963>—You told me that for you Sibyl Vane represented all the heroines of novels; that one night she was Desdemona and another Juliet; that if she died as Juliet, she came back to life as Imogen.</t2963>
<t2964>—He will never come back to life —murmured the boy, hiding his face in his hands.</t2964>
<t2965>—No, never again.</t2965> <t2966>She has played her last role.</t2966> <t2967>But you must think of that lonely death in a tinsel dressing room as a strange, eerie passage from a Jacobean tragedy, like a wonderful scene by Webster, Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.</t2967> <t2968>That girl never really lived, so she never truly died either.</t2968> <t2969>To you, at least, she was always a dream, a ghost flitting through Shakespeare's plays and making them more charming with her presence, a pipe with which Shakespeare's music sounded better and more joyful.</t2969> <t2970>The moment she touched real life, the charm vanished, life spoiled her, and Sibyl died.</t2970> <t2971>Mourn for Ophelia, if you wish.</t2971> <t2972>Cover your head with ashes because Cordelia has been strangled.</t2972> <t2973>Cry out against the heavens because Brabantio's daughter has died.</t2973> <t2974>But do not waste your tears for Sibyl Vane.</t2974> <t2975>She was less real than all of them.</t2975>
<t2976>There was a moment of silence.</t2976> <t2977>The afternoon was darkening in the library.</t2977> <t2978>Mute, and with silver feet, the shadows from the garden entered the house.</t2978> <t2979>The colors wearily disappeared from the objects.</t2979>
<t2980>After some time, Dorian Gray raised his eyes.</t2980> <t2981>—You have explained myself to me, Harry —he murmured, with something like a sigh of relief—.</t2981> <t2982>Although I felt what you said, I was scared, and I was not able to tell it to myself.</t2982> <t2983>How well you know me!</t2983> <t2984>But let's not talk anymore about what happened.</t2984> <t2985>It has been a wonderful experience.</t2985> <t2986>That is all.</t2986> <t2987>I wonder if life still has something else as extraordinary in store for me.</t2987>
<t2988>—Life has everything in store for you, Dorian.</t2988> <t2989>There is nothing you are not capable of doing, with your marvelous beauty.</t2989>
<t2990>—But suppose, Harry, that I became haggard and old and filled with wrinkles.</t2990> <t2991>What would happen then?</t2991>
<t2992>—Ah —said Lord Henry, standing up to leave—, in that case, my dear Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories.</t2992> <t2993>For now, they are thrown at your feet.</t2993> <t2994>No; you have to remain as you are.</t2994> <t2995>We live in an age that reads too much to be wise and thinks too much to be beautiful.</t2995> <t2996>We cannot do without you.</t2996> <t2997>And now you'd better get dressed and let's take the carriage to the club.</t2997> <t2998>We have already delayed enough.</t2998>
<t2999>—I think I will meet you at the opera.</t2999> <t3000>I am too tired to eat anything.</t3000> <t3001>What is your sister's box number?</t3001>
<t3002>—Twenty-seven, I think.</t3002> <t3003>It's on the first floor.</t3003> <t3004>You will find his name on the door.</t3004> <t3005>But I regret that you won't dine with me.</t3005>
<t3006>—I don't feel capable —said Dorian distractedly—, although I am terribly grateful to you for everything you have said.</t3006> <t3007>You are without a doubt my best friend.</t3007> <t3008>No one has ever understood me like you do.</t3008>
<t3009>—We are only at the beginning of our friendship —replied Lord Henry, shaking his hand—.</t3009> <t3010>See you later.</t3010> <t3011>I hope to see you before half-past nine.</t3011> <t3012>Don't forget that Patti is singing.</t3012>
<t3013>When the library door closed, Dorian Gray rang the bell and a few minutes later Victor appeared with the lamps and lowered the blinds.</t3013> <t3014>Dorian waited impatiently for him to leave.</t3014> <t3015>He had the impression that each gesture took an infinite amount of time.</t3015>
<t3016>As soon as he had left, he ran towards the screen, removing it.</t3016> <t3017>No; no new change had occurred.</t3017> <t3018>The portrait had received the news of Sibyl's death before he did.</t3018> <t3019>It was aware of the events of life as they happened.</t3019> <t3020>The dissolute cruelty that disfigured the delicate lines of the mouth had undoubtedly appeared at the very moment the girl drank the poison, whatever it was.</t3020> <t3021>Or was it indifferent to the results?</t3021> <t3022>Did it simply become aware of what was happening inside the soul?</t3022> <t3023>He couldn't say, but he did not lose hope that one day he might see the change take place before his eyes, shuddering as he desired it.</t3023>
<t3024>Poor Sibyl!</t3024> <t3025>How romantic it had all been!</t3025> <t3026>How many times had she pretended on stage the death that had finally touched her, taking her away!</t3026> <t3027>How would she have performed that last and terrible scene?</t3027> <t3028>Would she have cursed him while she died?</t3028> <t3029>No; she had died of love for him, and love would be his sacrament from then on.</t3029> <t3030>Sibyl had atoned for everything with the sacrifice of her life.</t3030> <t3031>He would no longer think of what he had made her suffer, on that horrible night at the theater.</t3031> <t3032>When he thought of her, he would see her as a wonderful tragic figure sent to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of love.</t3032> <t3033>A wonderful tragic figure?</t3033> <t3034>His eyes filled with tears as he remembered her childlike appearance, her attractive and fanciful manner, and her timid, throbbing grace.</t3034> <t3035>He hastily pushed those memories aside and looked back at the painting.</t3035>
<t3036>He understood that the moment to choose had truly arrived.</t3036> <t3037>Or had the choice already been made?</t3037> <t3038>Yes; life had decided for him; life and his infinite personal curiosity about life.</t3038> <t3039>Eternal youth, infinite passion, subtle and secret pleasures, violent joys, and even more violent sins; he did not want to forgo anything.</t3039> <t3040>The portrait would bear the weight of the shame; that was all.</t3040>
<t3041>A feeling of pain overcame him at the thought of the desecration that awaited the beautiful face in the portrait.</t3041> <t3042>On one occasion, in an adolescent mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or pretended to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled at him so cruelly.</t3042> <t3043>Day after day he had stood before the portrait, marveling at its beauty, almost —it sometimes seemed to him— in love with it.</t3043> <t3044>Would it now change every time he yielded to some whim?</t3044> <t3045>Was it going to become a monstrous and repugnant object, which would have to be hidden in a locked room, away from the sunlight that so often had turned the wavy marvel of his hair into dazzling gold?</t3045> <t3046>What a terrible prospect!</t3046>
<t3047>For a moment he thought of praying for the dreadful communion that existed between the painting and himself to cease.</t3047> <t3048>The change had occurred in response to a prayer; perhaps in response to another, it would become unaltered again.</t3048> <t3049>And yet, who, knowing something about Life, would renounce the privilege of remaining forever young, no matter how fantastic that possibility might be or how fatal the consequences?</t3049> <t3050>Besides, was it really within his power to control it?</t3050> <t3051>Had a prayer been the cause of the change?</t3051> <t3052>Could there perhaps be some scientific reason?</t3052> <t3053>If thought influenced a living organism, could it not also exert that influence on dead and inorganic things?</t3053> <t3054>Moreover, was it not possible that, without conscious thoughts or desires, external things to us vibrated in union with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom in a secret love of strange affinity?</t3054> <t3055>But the reason mattered little.</t3055> <t3056>He would never again tempt any terrible power with a prayer.</t3056> <t3057>If the portrait had to change, it would change.</t3057> <t3058>That was all.</t3058> <t3059>What need was there to delve deeper?</t3059>
<t3060>Because it would be a true pleasure to examine the portrait.</t3060> <t3061>In this way, I could penetrate even the most secret folds of his soul.</t3061> <t3062>The portrait would become the most magical of mirrors.</t3062> <t3063>Just as it had revealed his body, it would also reveal his soul.</t3063> <t3064>And when winter came to that soul, he would still remain where spring trembles, about to turn into summer.</t3064> <t3065>When the blood disappeared from his face, leaving a pale plaster mask with leaden eyes, he would retain the allure of adolescence.</t3065> <t3066>Not an atom of his beauty would ever wither.</t3066> <t3067>The rhythm of his life would never weaken.</t3067> <t3068>Like the gods of the Greeks, he would always be strong, swift, and joyful.</t3068> <t3069>What did it matter what happened to the colored image on the canvas?</t3069> <t3070>He would be safe.</t3070> <t3071>That was the only thing that mattered.</t3071>
<t3072>He put the screen back in its previous position, in front of the portrait, smiling as he did so, and entered the bedroom, where his valet was already waiting for him.</t3072> <t3073>An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his chair.</t3073>
<t3074>Chapter 9</t3074>
<t3075>When I was having breakfast the next morning, the servant showed Basil Hallward in.</t3075>
<t3076>—I'm glad to have found you, Dorian —said the painter with a solemn tone—.</t3076> <t3077>I came to see you last night, and they told me you were at the opera.</t3077> <t3078>I understood that it wasn't possible.</t3078> <t3079>But I regret that you didn't say where you were really going.</t3079> <t3080>I had a horrible evening, half fearing that one tragedy might be followed by another.</t3080> <t3081>I think you should have telegraphed me when you found out what happened.</t3081> <t3082>I read it almost by chance in the last edition of the Globe, which I found at the club.</t3082> <t3083>I came here immediately, and I was very sorry not to see you.</t3083> <t3084>I don't know how to explain to you how much I regret what happened.</t3084> <t3085>I understand how much you are suffering.</t3085> <t3086>But, where were you?</t3086> <t3087>Did you go to see that girl's mother?</t3087> <t3088>For a moment I thought about following you there.</t3088> <t3089>They gave the address in the newspaper.</t3089> <t3090>A place on Euston Road, isn't that right?</t3090> <t3091>But I was afraid of stirring up a pain that I couldn't alleviate.</t3091> <t3092>Poor woman!</t3092> <t3093>In what state she must be!</t3093> <t3094>And her only daughter!</t3094> <t3095>What has she said about what happened?</t3095>
<t3096>—My dear Basil, how do you expect me to know?</t3096> <t3097>—murmured Dorian Gray, taking a sip of pale white wine from a delicate Venetian crystal glass adorned with gold pearls, with an air of extreme boredom—.</t3097> <t3098>I was at the opera.</t3098> <t3099>You should have gone there.</t3099> <t3100>I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister.</t3100> <t3101>We were in her box.</t3101> <t3102>She is absolutely charming; and Patti sang divinely.</t3102> <t3103>Don't talk about horrible things.</t3103> <t3104>It's enough not to talk about something for it to have never happened.</t3104> <t3105>As Harry says, the act of expressing things is what gives them reality.</t3105> <t3106>Though I might mention that she was not an only child.</t3106> <t3107>There is a male, an excellent boy, I believe.</t3107> <t3108>But he is not involved in the theater.</t3108> <t3109>He is a sailor or something like that.</t3109> <t3110>And now tell me about yourself and what you are painting.</t3110>
<t3111>—You went to the opera —exclaimed Hallward, speaking very slowly, his voice trembling with pain—.</t3111> <t3112>Did you go to the opera while Sibyl Vane's corpse lay in some sordid place?</t3112> <t3113>Are you capable of talking to me about how charming other women are and the wonderful voice of Patti, before the girl you loved even has the peace of a grave to rest in?</t3113> <t3114>Do you not know the horrors that await her body, still so white?</t3114>
<t3115>—Enough! I am not willing to listen to it! —exclaimed Dorian, standing up abruptly—.</t3115> <t3116>Do not talk to me about those things.</t3116> <t3117>What is done, is done.</t3117> <t3118>The past is the past.</t3118>
<t3119>—Do you call yesterday the past?</t3119>
<t3120>—What does the elapsed time have to do with it?</t3120> <t3121>Only superficial people need years to discard an emotion.</t3121> <t3122>A man who is master of himself ends a sorrow as easily as he invents a pleasure.</t3122> <t3123>I do not want to be at the mercy of my emotions.</t3123> <t3124>I want to use them, enjoy them, dominate them.</t3124>
<t3125>—What you say is horrible, Dorian!</t3125> <t3126>Something has completely changed you.</t3126> <t3127>You still look like the wonderful young man who, day after day, came to my studio to pose.</t3127> <t3128>But then you were a simple, spontaneous, and affectionate person.</t3128> <t3129>You were the most honest creature on earth.</t3129> <t3130>Now, I don't know what has happened to you.</t3130> <t3131>You speak as if you have no heart, as if you are incapable of compassion.</t3131> <t3132>It's Harry's influence.</t3132> <t3133>I see it all too clearly.</t3133>
<t3134>The boy blushed and, approaching the window, gazed for a few moments at the brilliant green of the garden, bathed in sunlight.</t3134>
<t3135>—I owe a lot to Harry—he finally said—; more than I owe to you.</t3135> <t3136>You only taught me to be vain.</t3136>
<t3137>—No doubt I am being punished for it; or I will be someday.</t3137>
<t3138>—I don't understand what you're saying, Basil —exclaimed Dorian Gray, turning around—.</t3138> <t3139>I also don't know what you want.</t3139> <t3140>What is it that you want?</t3140>
<t3141>"I want the Dorian Gray whose portrait I painted long ago," said the artist sadly.</t3141>
<t3142>—Basil —said the boy, approaching him and placing his hand on his shoulder—, you have arrived too late.</t3142> <t3143>Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl Vane had taken her own life...</t3143>
<t3144>—Taken his life!</t3144> <t3145>Good heavens! Is it known for certain? —exclaimed Hallward, looking horrified at his friend.</t3145>
<t3146>—My dear Basil!</t3146> <t3147>You don't think it was a mere accident, do you?</t3147> <t3148>Of course he committed suicide.</t3148>
<t3149>The oldest man covered his face with his hands.</t3149>
<t3150>—What a terrible thing —he murmured, his whole body shaken by a tremor.</t3150>
<t3151>—No —said Dorian Gray—; there is nothing terrible about it.</t3151> <t3152>It is one of the great romantic tragedies of our time.</t3152> <t3153>Generally, actors lead quite ordinary lives.</t3153> <t3154>They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something equally tedious.</t3154> <t3155>You know what I mean, middle-class virtues and all that sort of thing.</t3155> <t3156>How different was Sibyl, who lived her greatest tragedy!</t3156> <t3157>She was always a heroine.</t3157> <t3158>The last night she acted, the night you saw her, her performance was bad because she had discovered the reality of love.</t3158> <t3159>When she realized its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died.</t3159> <t3160>She returned once more to the sphere of art.</t3160> <t3161>There was something of the martyr about her.</t3161> <t3162>Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.</t3162> <t3163>But, as I was saying, you must not think that I have not suffered.</t3163> <t3164>If you had come yesterday at a certain moment, around half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six, you would have found me weeping.</t3164> <t3165>Even Harry, who was here and brought me the news, did not realize what was happening to me.</t3165> <t3166>I suffered immensely.</t3166> <t3167>Then the suffering ended.</t3167> <t3168>I cannot repeat an emotion.</t3168> <t3169>No one can, except sentimental people.</t3169> <t3170>And you are terribly unjust, Basil.</t3170> <t3171>You come here to console me.</t3171> <t3172>It is very much appreciated.</t3172> <t3173>You find me consoled and you get furious.</t3173> <t3174>Bravo for compassionate people!</t3174> <t3175>You make me think of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years trying to rectify a grievance or change an unjust law, I don't remember exactly what it was about.</t3175> <t3176>He finally succeeded, and his disappointment was immense.</t3176> <t3177>Having absolutely nothing to do, he almost died of ennui, becoming a perfect misanthrope.</t3177> <t3178>And besides, my dear Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened or to see it from the most convenient artistic angle.</t3178> <t3179>Wasn't it Gautier who spoke about the consolation of the arts?</t3179> <t3180>I remember finding a little vellum-bound book in your studio one day where I discovered that delightful phrase by chance.</t3180> <t3181>Well, I am not like the young man you told me about when we were together in Marlow, the young man for whom yellow satin could console anyone for all the sorrows of life.</t3181> <t3182>I like beautiful things that can be touched and used.</t3182> <t3183>Old brocades, bronzes with patina, lacquered objects, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp: there is much to enjoy in all these things.</t3183> <t3184>But the artistic temperament they create, or at least reveal, is even more important to me.</t3184> <t3185>To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape its sufferings.</t3185> <t3186>I know it surprises you that I speak to you this way.</t3186> <t3187>You have not realized how I have matured.</t3187> <t3188>I was only a schoolboy when you met me.</t3188> <t3189>I am a man now.</t3189> <t3190>I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas.</t3190> <t3191>I am different, but you must not love me less.</t3191> <t3192>I have changed, but you will always be my friend.</t3192> <t3193>It is true that I am very fond of Harry.</t3193> <t3194>But I know you are better.</t3194> <t3195>Less strong, because you are too afraid of life, but better.</t3195> <t3196>And how happy we were when we were together!</t3196> <t3197>Don't leave me, Basil, nor quarrel with me.</t3197> <t3198>I am what I am.</t3198> <t3199>There is nothing more to say.</t3199>
<t3200>The painter felt strangely moved.</t3200> <t3201>He infinitely appreciated Dorian, and thanks to his personality, his art had taken a decisive step forward.</t3201> <t3202>There was no point in thinking about reproaching him anymore.</t3202> <t3203>Perhaps his indifference was a passing mood.</t3203> <t3204>There was so much goodness in him, so much nobility!</t3204>
<t3205>—Well, Dorian —he said, finally, with a sad smile—; from today onwards, I will not speak to you again about that terrible event.</t3205> <t3206>I only wish that your name is not involved in a scandal.</t3206> <t3207>The judicial investigation is being held this afternoon.</t3207> <t3208>Have you been summoned?</t3208>
<t3209>Dorian shook his head; and an expression of annoyance crossed his face upon hearing the word "investigation" mentioned.</t3209> <t3210>The whole affair had something vulgar and coarse about it.</t3210>
<t3211>—They don't know my name —he replied.</t3211>
<t3212>—Not her either?</t3212>
<t3213>—Only my first name, and I'm sure she never told anyone.</t3213> <t3214>Once she told me that everyone was very curious to know who I was, but she always said I was Prince Charming.</t3214> <t3215>A kindness on her part.</t3215> <t3216>You must draw a picture of Sibyl for me, Basil.</t3216> <t3217>I would like to have more than just the memory of a few kisses and some broken words full of pathos.</t3217>
<t3218>—I will try to do something, Dorian, if that pleases you.</t3218> <t3219>But you have to come and pose for me again.</t3219> <t3220>Without you, I do nothing worthwhile.</t3220>
<t3221>—I will never pose for you again.</t3221> <t3222>It's impossible! —exclaimed Dorian, stepping back.</t3222>
<t3223>The painter stared at him intently.</t3223>
<t3224>—My dear Dorian, that's nonsense! —he exclaimed—.</t3224> <t3225>Do you mean to say you don't like the portrait I painted of you?</t3225> <t3226>Where is it? Why have you placed that screen in front of it?</t3226> <t3227>Let me see it.</t3227> <t3228>It's the best thing I've done.</t3228> <t3229>Please remove the screen, Dorian.</t3229> <t3230>I find it shameful that your servant hides my portrait in that manner.</t3230> <t3231>Now I understand why the room seemed different when I entered.</t3231>
<t3232>—My servant has nothing to do with that.</t3232> <t3233>You wouldn't imagine that I let him arrange the library for me, would you?</t3233> <t3234>Sometimes he places the flowers... that's all.</t3234> <t3235>No; it was I who did it.</t3235> <t3236>The light was too strong for the portrait.</t3236>
<t3237>—Too strong!</t3237> <t3238>It can't be.</t3238> <t3239>It's an admirable spot for that painting.</t3239> <t3240>Let me see it.</t3240>
<t3241>A scream of terror escaped from the mouth of Dorian Gray, who ran to position himself between the painter and the screen.</t3241>
<t3242>—Basil —he said, extremely pale—, you must not see it.</t3242> <t3243>I don't want you to see it.</t3243>
<t3244>—I must not see my own work!</t3244> <t3245>You're not serious.</t3245> <t3246>Why shouldn't I see it? —asked Hallward, laughing.</t3246>
<t3247>—If you try to look at it, I swear on my honor that I will never speak to you again as long as I live.</t3247> <t3248>I am completely serious.</t3248> <t3249>I am not giving you any explanation, nor do I allow you to ask for one.</t3249> <t3250>But remember, if you touch that screen, our friendship will be over forever.</t3250>
<t3251>Hallward was stunned.</t3251> <t3252>He looked at Dorian Gray with infinite astonishment.</t3252> <t3253>He had never seen him like this.</t3253> <t3254>The boy was livid with rage.</t3254> <t3255>He clenched his fists, and his pupils were like discs of blue fire.</t3255> <t3256>He was trembling from head to toe.</t3256>
<t3257>—Dorian!</t3257>
<t3258>—Don't say anything!</t3258>
<t3259>—But, what is wrong with you?</t3259> <t3260>Of course I'm not going to look at it if you don't want me to —he said, quite coldly, turning on his heels and approaching the window—.</t3260> <t3261>But it seems quite absurd to me that I can't see my own work, especially when I'm about to exhibit it in Paris in the fall.</t3261> <t3262>I'll probably have to give it another coat of varnish beforehand, so I'll have to see it someday, and why not today?</t3262>
<t3263>—Expose it? Do you want to expose it?</t3263> <t3264>—exclaimed Dorian Gray, feeling a strange terror engulf him.</t3264> <t3265>Was the world going to witness his secret?</t3265> <t3266>Would people be left gaping at the mystery of his life?</t3266> <t3267>Impossible.</t3267> <t3268>Something had to be done, he didn't know what yet, and it had to be done immediately.</t3268>
<t3269>—Yes; I hope you don't mind.</t3269> <t3270>George Petit is going to gather my best works for a personal exhibition on rue de Séze that will open the first week of October.</t3270> <t3271>The portrait will only be away for a month.</t3271> <t3272>I think you can do without it for that time.</t3272> <t3273>In fact, it's certain that you won't be in London.</t3273> <t3274>And if you have it behind a screen, it means you don't care too much about it.</t3274>
<t3275>Dorian Gray ran his hand across his forehead, where droplets of sweat had appeared.</t3275> <t3276>He felt on the edge of a dreadful abyss.</t3276>
<t3277>—A month ago you told me you would never exhibit it —he exclaimed—.</t3277> <t3278>Why have you changed your mind?</t3278> <t3279>You people who boast about being consistent are as capricious as everyone else.</t3279> <t3280>The only difference is that your whims make no sense.</t3280> <t3281>It is not possible that you have forgotten: you assured me with all the solemnity in the world that nothing would compel you to send it to any exhibition.</t3281> <t3282>And you told Harry exactly the same thing.</t3282>
<t3283>He stopped suddenly, and a special gleam appeared in his eyes.</t3283> <t3284>He remembered that Lord Henry had once told him, half-seriously and half-jokingly: "If you want to spend an unusual quarter of an hour, have Basil tell you why he doesn't want to exhibit your portrait.</t3284> <t3285>He told me, and it was quite a revelation."</t3285> <t3286>Yes; perhaps Basil also had his secret.</t3286> <t3287>What if he tried to question him?</t3287>
<t3288>—Basil —he said, coming very close and looking him straight in the eyes—, we both have a secret.</t3288> <t3289>Tell me yours and I will tell you mine.</t3289> <t3290>What reason did you have for refusing to exhibit the portrait?</t3290>
<t3291>The painter shuddered despite himself.</t3291>
<t3292>—If I told you, it might diminish the appreciation you have for me, and without a doubt, you would laugh at me.</t3292> <t3293>It is unbearable for me that either of those two things happen.</t3293> <t3294>If you don't want me to see the painting again, I accept it.</t3294> <t3295>I can always look at you.</t3295> <t3296>If you want my best work to remain hidden from the world, I am satisfied.</t3296> <t3297>Your friendship is more important to me than fame or reputation.</t3297>
<t3298>—No, Basil; you have to tell me —insisted Dorian Gray—.</t3298> <t3299>I think I have the right to know it —the feeling of terror had disappeared, replaced by curiosity.</t3299> <t3300>He was determined to uncover the mystery of Basil Hallward.</t3300>
<t3301>"Let's sit down, Dorian," said the painter with a worried expression.</t3301> <t3302>“Sit down and answer me just one question.</t3302> <t3303>Have you noticed anything peculiar in the painting?</t3303> <t3304>Something that you probably didn't notice at first, but that has suddenly revealed itself to you?”</t3304>
<t3305>—Basil! —exclaimed the boy, gripping the arms of the chair with trembling hands, and looking at him with eyes more filled with fear than with surprise.</t3305>
<t3306>—I see that you do.</t3306> <t3307>Don't say anything.</t3307> <t3308>Wait to hear what I have to say.</t3308> <t3309>From the moment I met you, your personality has had the most extraordinary influence on me.</t3309> <t3310>You have dominated my soul, my brain, my energies.</t3310> <t3311>You became the tangible embodiment of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts artists like an ineffable dream.</t3311> <t3312>I idolized you.</t3312> <t3313>I felt jealous of everyone you spoke to.</t3313> <t3314>I wanted you for myself alone.</t3314> <t3315>I was only happy when I was with you.</t3315> <t3316>And when you were away from me, you were still present in my art...</t3316> <t3317>Of course, I never let you know any of this.</t3317> <t3318>It would have been impossible.</t3318> <t3319>You wouldn't have understood it.</t3319> <t3320>I barely understood it myself.</t3320> <t3321>I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that, before my eyes, the world had become something wonderful; too wonderful, perhaps, because in such excessive adoration there is a danger, the danger of losing it, no less serious than that of keeping it...</t3321> <t3322>Weeks and weeks passed, and I was more and more absorbed in you every day.</t3322> <t3323>Then something new happened.</t3323> <t3324>I had drawn you as Paris in a delicate armor, and as Adonis with a hunter's cloak and a polished spear.</t3324> <t3325>Crowned with lotus flowers at the prow of Hadrian's barge, looking towards the other shore over the green murky waters of the Nile.</t3325> <t3326>Bent over a still pond in some Greek forest, you had seen in the silent silver of the water the wonder of your own face.</t3326> <t3327>And everything had been, as befits art, unconscious, ideal, and remote.</t3327> <t3328>One day, a fateful day, I sometimes think, I decided to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you are, not in the garments of dead ages, but in your clothes and in your time.</t3328> <t3329>I don't know if it was the realism of the method or the very wonder of your personality, which presented itself to me then without intermediaries, without fog or veil.</t3329> <t3330>But I know that while I was working on it, with each brushstroke, with each touch of color, it seemed to me that I was revealing my secret.</t3330> <t3331>I was afraid that others would notice my idolatry.</t3331> <t3332>I realized that I had said too much, that I had put too much of myself into that painting.</t3332> <t3333>I then decided not to allow the portrait to ever be exhibited in public.</t3333> <t3334>You were a little upset; but you didn't realize all that it meant to me.</t3334> <t3335>Harry, to whom I spoke about it, laughed at me.</t3335> <t3336>But I didn't care.</t3336> <t3337>When the painting was finished, and I was alone with it, I felt that I was right...</t3337> <t3338>Then, a few days later, the canvas left my studio, and as soon as I was freed from the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed absurd to imagine that there was anything special about it, apart from the fact that you were very handsome and that I was capable of painting.</t3338> <t3339>Even now I can't help but think that it is a mistake to believe that the passion felt during creation truly appears in the created work.</t3339> <t3340>Art is always more abstract than we imagine.</t3340> <t3341>Form and color only speak of themselves..., that's all.</t3341> <t3342>It often seems to me that art hides the artist much more than it reveals him.</t3342> <t3343>So when I received the invitation from Paris, I decided to make your portrait the main piece of my exhibition.</t3343> <t3344>It never occurred to me that you would refuse.</t3344> <t3345>Now I understand that you were right.</t3345> <t3346>The portrait cannot be shown.</t3346> <t3347>Don't be angry with me for what I've told you, Dorian.</t3347> <t3348>As I once told Harry, you are made to be adored.</t3348>
<t3349>Dorian Gray took a deep breath.</t3349> <t3350>His cheeks regained their color and his lips played with a smile.</t3350> <t3351>The danger had passed.</t3351> <t3352>For the moment, he was safe.</t3352> <t3353>But he couldn't help feeling an infinite pity for the painter who had just made that strange confession to him, while wondering if he would ever feel so dominated by the personality of a friend.</t3353> <t3354>Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous.</t3354> <t3355>But nothing more.</t3355> <t3356>He was too intelligent and too cynical for anyone to feel a passionate affection for him.</t3356> <t3357>Would there ever be someone who would inspire in him, in Dorian Gray, such strange idolatry?</t3357> <t3358>Was that one of the things life had in store for him?</t3358>
<t3359>—It seems extraordinary to me, Dorian —continued Hallward—, that you have discovered my secret in the portrait.</t3359> <t3360>Have you really seen it?</t3360>
<t3361>—I saw something in him —replied the young man—; something that seemed extremely curious to me.</t3361>
<t3362>—Well; now you won't mind if I see it, right?</t3362>
<t3363>Dorian shook his head.</t3363>
<t3364>—Don't ask me that, Basil.</t3364> <t3365>I can't allow you to see that painting face to face.</t3365>
<t3366>—But a day will come when it will.</t3366>
<t3367>—Never.</t3367>
<t3368>—Well; perhaps you are right.</t3368> <t3369>I bid you farewell.</t3369> <t3370>You have been the only person who has truly influenced my art.</t3370> <t3371>If I have done anything worthwhile, I owe it to you.</t3371> <t3372>Ah!</t3372> <t3373>You don't know how much it has cost me to tell you everything I have told you.</t3373>
<t3374>—My dear Basil —replied Dorian—, what is it that you have told me?</t3374> <t3375>Simply, that it seemed to you that you admired me too much.</t3375> <t3376>That doesn't even amount to a compliment.</t3376>
<t3377>—It was not my intention to compliment you.</t3377> <t3378>It was a confession.</t3378> <t3379>Now that I have made it, I feel like I have lost something of myself.</t3379> <t3380>Perhaps one should never translate a feeling of adoration into words.</t3380>
<t3381>—It has been a very disappointing confession.</t3381>
<t3382>—What did you expect, Dorian?</t3382> <t3383>You haven't seen anything else in the picture, have you?</t3383> <t3384>Was there anything else to see?</t3384>
<t3385>—No, there was nothing else.</t3385> <t3386>Why do you ask?</t3386> <t3387>But you must not speak of worship.</t3387> <t3388>It makes no sense.</t3388> <t3389>You and I are friends, and we must always remain so.</t3389>
<t3390>"You have Harry," said the painter sadly.</t3390>
<t3391>—Ah, Harry! —exclaimed the boy with a laugh—.</t3391> <t3392>Harry spends his days saying incredible things and his evenings doing improbable things.</t3392> <t3393>Exactly the kind of life I would like to lead.</t3393> <t3394>But anyway, I don't think I would go looking for Harry when I had problems.</t3394> <t3395>I think I would go to see you first.</t3395>
<t3396>—Will you pose for me again?</t3396>
<t3397>—Impossible!</t3397>
<t3398>—You destroy my life as an artist by refusing.</t3398> <t3399>No one stumbles upon the ideal twice.</t3399> <t3400>And very few even find it once.</t3400>
<t3401>—I can't explain it to you, but I can't pose for you again.</t3401> <t3402>There is something fatal in a portrait.</t3402> <t3403>It has a life of its own.</t3403> <t3404>I'll go have tea with you.</t3404> <t3405>It will be just as pleasant.</t3405>
<t3406>—Pleasant for you, I very much fear —murmured Hallward, sorrowful—.</t3406> <t3407>And now, goodbye.</t3407> <t3408>I regret that you won't let me see the painting once more.</t3408> <t3409>But what can be done.</t3409> <t3410>I completely understand your feelings.</t3410>
<t3411>As he watched him leave the room, Dorian Gray couldn't help but smile.</t3411> <t3412>Poor Basil! How far he was from knowing the real reason!</t3412> <t3413>And how strange it was that, instead of being forced to reveal his own secret, he had managed, almost by chance, to extract his friend's!</t3413> <t3414>How many things that strange confession had explained to him!</t3414> <t3415>The painter's absurd fits of jealousy, his excessive devotion, his extravagant praises, his curious reticences... now he understood everything, and he felt pity.</t3415> <t3416>It seemed to him that there was something tragic in a friendship so close to love.</t3416>
<t3417>He sighed and rang the bell.</t3417> <t3418>He had to hide the portrait at all costs.</t3418> <t3419>He couldn't risk being discovered again.</t3419> <t3420>It had been madness to allow it to remain, even for an hour, in a room where his friends entered.</t3420>
<t3421>Chapter 10</t3421>
<t3422>When the servant entered, he looked at him intently, wondering if it had occurred to him to snoop behind the screen.</t3422> <t3423>Absolutely impassive, Victor awaited his orders.</t3423> <t3424>Dorian lit a cigarette and approached the mirror.</t3424> <t3425>In it, he saw the face of the valet reflected clearly, a perfect mask of servility.</t3425> <t3426>There was nothing to fear from that side.</t3426> <t3427>But he immediately thought it was better to stay on guard.</t3427>
<t3428>In a calm voice, he asked her to tell the housekeeper that he wanted to see her, and then to go to the marquis's shop and ask him to send two of his men immediately.</t3428> <t3429>It seemed to her that as she left the room, Victor's gaze shifted towards the screen.</t3429> <t3430>Or was it her imagination?</t3430>
<t3431>After a moment, with her black silk dress and old-fashioned thread mittens covering her hands, Mrs. Leaf hurriedly entered the library.</t3431> <t3432>Dorian asked her for the key to the schoolroom.</t3432>
<t3433>—The old classroom, Mr. Dorian? —exclaimed the housekeeper—.</t3433> <t3434>But it's full of dust!</t3434> <t3435>I have to clean and tidy up before letting you in.</t3435> <t3436>You can't see it as it is, no sir.</t3436>
<t3437>—I don't want you to put things in order, Leaf.</t3437> <t3438>I just want the key.</t3438>
<t3439>—Whatever you say, sir, but it will be filled with cobwebs.</t3439> <t3440>It has been almost five years since it was last opened, since his lordship passed away.</t3440>
<t3441>Dorian made a grimace upon hearing about his grandfather.</t3441> <t3442>He had very bad memories of him.</t3442>
<t3443>—It doesn't matter —he said—.</t3443> <t3444>I just want to see her, that's all.</t3444> <t3445>Give me the key.</t3445>
<t3446>—And here it is —said the old woman, going through the contents of her bunch of keys with tremblingly uncertain hands—.</t3446> <t3447>This is it.</t3447> <t3448>I'll take it out right away.</t3448> <t3449>You don't think you'll live there as comfortably as you are here, do you?</t3449>
<t3450>—No, no —exclaimed Dorian, somewhat irritated—.</t3450> <t3451>Thank you very much, Leaf.</t3451> <t3452>That is all.</t3452>
<t3453>The housekeeper took a few more moments to leave, elaborating on some detail of the household management.</t3453> <t3454>Dorian sighed and told her to manage everything as she saw fit.</t3454> <t3455>Finally, she left, beaming with smiles.</t3455>
<t3456>As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and scanned the library with his eyes.</t3456> <t3457>His eyes stopped on a large purple satin bedspread with gold embroidery that his grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.</t3457> <t3458>Yes; it would serve to wrap the horrible canvas.</t3458> <t3459>Perhaps it had been used more than once as a shroud.</t3459> <t3460>Now it would have to hide something with a peculiar corruption, worse than that of the dead: something that would spawn horrors without ever dying.</t3460> <t3461>What worms were to the corpse, his sins would be to the image painted on the canvas, destroying its comeliness and devouring its grace.</t3461> <t3462>They would stain it, turning it into something shameful.</t3462> <t3463>And yet that thing would remain alive, it would live forever.</t3463>
<t3464>Dorian shuddered and for a few moments regretted not having told Basil the real reason for hiding the portrait.</t3464> <t3465>The painter would have helped him resist the influence of Lord Henry, and another, even more poisonous one, that came from his own temperament.</t3465> <t3466>In the love that Basil professed for him—because it was true love—there was nothing that was not noble and intellectual.</t3466> <t3467>It was not the simple admiration of beauty that arises from the senses and dies when the senses grow tired.</t3467> <t3468>It was a love like that known by Michelangelo, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.</t3468> <t3469>Yes, Basil could have saved him.</t3469> <t3470>But it was already too late.</t3470> <t3471>The past could always be annihilated.</t3471> <t3472>Repentance, rejection, or forgetfulness could do it.</t3472> <t3473>But the future was inevitable.</t3473> <t3474>There were passions in him that would find their terrible incarnation, dreams that would make real the shadow of his perversity.</t3474>
<t3475>Dorian removed the large purple and gold cloth that covered the sofa and, with it in his hands, went behind the screen.</t3475> <t3476>Had the face on the canvas degraded even more?</t3476> <t3477>It seemed to him that it had not changed; however, the repulsion it inspired in him was increasing.</t3477> <t3478>Golden hair, blue eyes, burning lips: everything was there.</t3478> <t3479>Only the expression was different.</t3479> <t3480>Its cruelty frightened him.</t3480> <t3481>Compared to what he discovered there of censure and condemnation, how superficial Basil's reproaches about Sibyl Vane were!</t3481> <t3482>Superficial and trivial.</t3482> <t3483>His very soul looked at him from the canvas, calling him to judgment.</t3483> <t3484>Painfully affected, Dorian threw the luxurious shroud over the painting.</t3484> <t3485>As he did so, there was a knock at the door.</t3485> <t3486>He came out from behind the screen as the servant entered.</t3486>
<t3487>—Sir, those people have arrived.</t3487>
<t3488>Dorian felt that he had to get rid of Victor as soon as possible.</t3488> <t3489>He must not know where the painting was being taken.</t3489> <t3490>There was something malicious about him, and in his eyes shone calculation and betrayal.</t3490> <t3491>Sitting at the desk, he quickly drafted a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send some reading material and reminding him that they had agreed to meet at a quarter past eight.</t3491>
<t3492>—Wait for the response —he said to the valet as he handed him the letter—, and let those men in here.</t3492>
<t3493>Two or three minutes later, there was another knock at the door, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the famous framer from South Audley Street, entered with a rather coarse-looking young assistant.</t3493> <t3494>Mr. Hubbard was a little man with a ruddy complexion and red sideburns, whose enthusiasm for art was tempered by the persistent lack of resources of most of the artists he dealt with.</t3494> <t3495>He never left his shop in principle.</t3495> <t3496>He waited for customers to come to see him.</t3496> <t3497>But he always made an exception for Mr. Gray.</t3497> <t3498>There was something about Dorian that charmed everyone.</t3498> <t3499>Just seeing him was a pleasure.</t3499>
<t3500>—What can I do for you, Mr. Gray? —he said, rubbing his plump and freckled hands—.</t3500> <t3501>I thought it would be an honor for me to come in person.</t3501> <t3502>I have just acquired a frame that is a gem.</t3502> <t3503>At an auction.</t3503> <t3504>Ancient Florentine.</t3504> <t3505>I believe it comes from Fonthill.</t3505> <t3506>Wonderfully suitable for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.</t3506>
<t3507>—I'm very sorry that you went to so much trouble, Mr. Hubbard.</t3507> <t3508>I will certainly go to your establishment to see the frame, although lately, religious painting doesn't interest me much, but today it's just about getting a painting to the top of the house.</t3508> <t3509>It's quite heavy, and that's why I thought of asking you to lend me a couple of men.</t3509>
<t3510>—It is no trouble at all, Mr. Gray.</t3510> <t3511>It is a joy for me to be of service to you.</t3511> <t3512>What is the work of art?</t3512>
<t3513>—This one —replied Dorian Gray, moving the screen aside—.</t3513> <t3514>Can you move it, with the cloth covering it, just as it is?</t3514> <t3515>I don't want it to get scratched on the stairs.</t3515>
<t3516>—There is no difficulty at all —said the affable framer, beginning, with the help of his subordinate, to unhook the painting from the long bronze chains from which it was suspended—.</t3516> <t3517>And now, Mr. Gray, where do we need to take it?</t3517>
<t3518>—I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you would be so kind as to follow me.</t3518> <t3519>Or perhaps it would be better if you went ahead.</t3519> <t3520>I am very much afraid that the room is at the very top of the house.</t3520> <t3521>We will take the main staircase, which is wider.</t3521>
<t3522>He kept the door open to let them pass, they went out into the lobby and began the ascent up the stairs.</t3522> <t3523>The baroque ornamentation of the frame had made the portrait very bulky and, from time to time, despite the obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard, who was horrified, as all true merchants are, by the idea of a gentleman doing something useful, Dorian tried to lend them a hand.</t3523>
<t3524>—You can't say it's too light —said the sign maker with a breathless voice when they reached the last landing, proceeding to wipe his forehead.</t3524>
<t3525>—I'm afraid it weighs quite a bit —murmured Dorian, while, with the key that Mrs. Leaf had given him, he opened the door to the room that was going to guard the strange secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.</t3525>
<t3526>It had been more than four years since he last entered there, although at one time he had used it first as a playroom and later as a study room.</t3526> <t3527>A spacious and well-proportioned room, the late Lord Kelso had built it especially for the grandson he had always detested for his remarkable resemblance to his mother —and also for other reasons—, and whom he wanted to keep as far away as possible.</t3527> <t3528>To Dorian, it seemed that it had changed very little.</t3528> <t3529>There was the enormous Italian cassone, with its panels covered in fantastic paintings and its tarnished golden moldings, inside which he had often hidden as a child.</t3529> <t3530>There was the satinwood bookcase, full of his schoolbooks, showing evident signs of heavy use.</t3530> <t3531>From the wall behind still hung the same very worn Flemish tapestry, where a faded king and queen played chess in a garden, while a group of falconers rode by on horseback, with hooded birds on their gloved wrists.</t3531> <t3532>How well he remembered everything!</t3532> <t3533>The memories of his solitary childhood crowded into his mind as he looked around.</t3533> <t3534>He recalled the immaculate purity of his adolescent life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was there where he had to hide the fateful portrait.</t3534> <t3535>How little he had imagined, in those days dead forever, what fate had in store for him!</t3535>
<t3536>But there was no place in the entire house where he would be better protected from inquisitive eyes.</t3536> <t3537>With the key in his possession, no one else could enter there.</t3537> <t3538>Under its purple shroud, the face painted on the canvas could become bestial, deformed, filthy.</t3538> <t3539>What did it matter?</t3539> <t3540>No one would see it.</t3540> <t3541>Not even him.</t3541> <t3542>Why should he have to contemplate the hateful corruption of his soul?</t3542> <t3543>He would retain his youth: that was enough.</t3543> <t3544>And besides, wasn't there a possibility that one day more noble feelings might be born in him?</t3544> <t3545>There was no reason to think of a shameful future.</t3545> <t3546>Perhaps love could cross his life, purifying and protecting him from those sins that already seemed to stir in his flesh and spirit: those curious, still formless sins whose very indeterminacy lent them subtlety and allure.</t3546> <t3547>Maybe, one day, the rictus of cruelty would have disappeared from his delicate mouth and he would be in a position to show the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.</t3547>
<t3548>No; that was impossible.</t3548> <t3549>Hour by hour, week by week, the creature on the canvas would age.</t3549> <t3550>It might avoid the ugliness of sin, but not that of age.</t3550> <t3551>The cheeks would become gaunt and saggy.</t3551> <t3552>Yellow crow's feet would appear around dull eyes.</t3552> <t3553>The hair would lose its shine, the mouth would open or the corners would droop, giving the face a stupid or coarse expression, as happens with the mouths of the elderly.</t3553> <t3554>And the throat would fill with wrinkles, the hands with bluish veins, the body would become twisted, as had happened with his grandfather, who had been so strict with him in his youth.</t3554> <t3555>The painting had to be hidden.</t3555> <t3556>There was no other solution.</t3556>
<t3557>—Please bring it here, Mr. Hubbard —he said in a tired voice, turning around—.</t3557> <t3558>I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.</t3558> <t3559>I was thinking about something else.</t3559>
<t3560>—It's always good to rest a bit, Mr. Gray —replied the tattoo artist, who was still breathing somewhat heavily—.</t3560> <t3561>Where do we need to put it?</t3561>
<t3562>—Oh, anywhere.</t3562> <t3563>Right here; here will be fine.</t3563> <t3564>I don't want to hang it.</t3564> <t3565>Lean it against the wall.</t3565> <t3566>Thank you.</t3566>
<t3567>—Can the artwork be contemplated, Mr. Gray?</t3567>
<t3568>Dorian was startled.</t3568>
<t3569>—You wouldn't be interested, Mr. Hubbard —he said, staring at him intently.</t3569> <t3570>He felt ready to pounce on him and throw him to the ground if he dared to lift the luxurious fabric that hid the secret of his life—.</t3570> <t3571>I do not wish to trouble you any further.</t3571> <t3572>I am very grateful for your kindness in coming in person.</t3572>
<t3573>—Nothing of the sort, not at all, Mr. Gray.</t3573> <t3574>I will always be delighted to do anything for you —and Mr. Hubbard noisily descended the stairs followed by his assistant, who turned to look at Dorian with an expression of timid astonishment on his coarse features.</t3574> <t3575>He had never seen anyone so wonderful.</t3575>
<t3576>When the sound of his footsteps faded, Dorian closed the door and put the key in his pocket.</t3576> <t3577>Now he felt safe.</t3577> <t3578>No one would ever look upon that horrible creature again.</t3578> <t3579>No eyes but his own would see his shame.</t3579>
<t3580>Upon entering the library, he realized that it had just struck five and that his tea had already been brought.</t3580> <t3581>On a small table of dark fragrant wood with abundant mother-of-pearl inlays, a gift from Lady Radley, the wife of his tutor, a professional invalid with delicate tastes who had spent the previous winter in Cairo, there was a note from Lord Henry and, beside it, a book with a yellow cover, slightly torn and with frayed edges.</t3581> <t3582>On the tea tray, there was also a copy of the third edition of The St James's Gazette.</t3582> <t3583>It was evident that Victor had returned.</t3583> <t3584>He wondered if he had crossed paths with Mr. Hubbard in the hallway as he was leaving, discreetly questioning him to find out what he and his assistant had done.</t3584> <t3585>Undoubtedly, he would miss the painting; he would have already missed it while setting up the tea service.</t3585> <t3586>The screen had not been put back in its place, and the gap on the wall was perfectly visible.</t3586> <t3587>Perhaps one night he would find his servant stealthily climbing the stairs and trying to force the door of the old study room.</t3587> <t3588>It was horrible to have a spy in one's own house.</t3588> <t3589>He had heard stories about wealthy people, blackmailed all their lives by a servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or kept a card with an address, or found a withered flower under a pillow or a crumpled piece of lace.</t3589>
<t3590>He sighed and, after serving himself a cup of tea, read Lord Henry's note.</t3590> <t3591>It only said that he was sending him the evening newspaper and a book that might interest him; and that he would be at the club at a quarter past eight.</t3591> <t3592>Dorian languidly opened The Gazette to take a look at it.</t3592> <t3593>On page five, a paragraph marked with a red pencil caught his attention:</t3593>
<t3594>«JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO AN ACTRESS.</t3594> <t3595>This morning, at Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, Mr. Danby, the district coroner, conducted an inquiry into the death of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently contracted by the Royal Theatre of Holberon.</t3595> <t3596>The verdict was accidental death.</t3596> <t3597>Many expressions of condolence have been received by the deceased's mother, who was very affected by the events during her personal testimony, which was followed by that of Dr. Birrell, who conducted the post-mortem examination of the deceased.»</t3597>
<t3598>Dorian frowned and, tearing the newspaper in two, crossed the room and disposed of the pieces.</t3598> <t3599>How unpleasant it all was!</t3599> <t3600>And how ugliness contributed to making things more real!</t3600> <t3601>He felt somewhat annoyed with Lord Henry for having sent him that news.</t3601> <t3602>And it was certainly foolish of him to have marked it with a red pencil.</t3602> <t3603>Victor could have read it.</t3603> <t3604>He knew more than enough English to do so.</t3604>
<t3605>Maybe he had done it, and he was beginning to suspect something.</t3605> <t3606>What did it matter, anyway?</t3606> <t3607>What did Dorian Gray have to do with Sibyl Vane's death?</t3607> <t3608>There was nothing to fear.</t3608> <t3609>He hadn't killed her.</t3609>
<t3610>He contemplated the book that Lord Henry had sent him.</t3610> <t3611>He wondered what it could be.</t3611> <t3612>He went to the pearl-colored octagonal table, which had always seemed to him the work of strange Egyptian bees that worked silver, took the volume, dropped into an armchair, and began to flip through the pages.</t3612> <t3613>Within a few minutes, it had completely captured him.</t3613> <t3614>It was the strangest book he had ever read.</t3614> <t3615>It seemed that the sins of the world, exquisitely dressed and accompanied by the delicate sound of flutes, passed before his eyes like a succession of living pictures.</t3615> <t3616>Things he had dreamt of vaguely suddenly became real.</t3616> <t3617>Things he had never dreamt of began to reveal themselves to him little by little.</t3617>
<t3618>It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, as it was, in reality, a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who spent his life trying to experience in the 19th century all the passions and ways of thinking belonging to the centuries before his own, summarizing in himself, so to speak, the different states of mind through which the spirit of the world had passed, and who loved, for their very artificiality, those renunciations that men erroneously call virtues, as well as the natural rebellions that the prudent call sins.</t3618> <t3619>The book was written in a curiously ornamental style, graphic and obscure at the same time, full of slang and archaisms, of technical expressions and the complicated periphrases that characterize the work of some of the best artists of the French symbolist school.</t3619> <t3620>There were metaphors in it as monstrous as orchids, and with the same subtlety of color.</t3620> <t3621>The life of the senses was described with the language of mystical philosophy.</t3621> <t3622>Sometimes it was difficult to know whether one was reading the description of the ecstasies of some medieval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner.</t3622> <t3623>It was a poisonous book.</t3623> <t3624>The dense smell of incense seemed to emanate from its pages and disturb the brain.</t3624> <t3625>The very cadence of the phrases, the subtle monotony of its music, so full of complex refrains and elaborately repeated movements, produced in Dorian Gray's mind, as he passed from chapter to chapter, something akin to a daydream, a sleeping sickness that made him unaware that the day was fading and the shadows were growing.</t3625>
<t3626>Clear of clouds and pierced by a solitary star, a sky of greenish copper color shone on the other side of the windows.</t3626> <t3627>Dorian continued reading by its pale light until he could no longer continue.</t3627> <t3628>Then, after the valet had reminded him several times that it was getting late, he stood up and, moving to the adjacent room, placed the book on the Florentine table that was always next to his bed, and began to dress for dinner.</t3628>
<t3629>It was almost nine o'clock when he arrived at the club, where he found Lord Henry alone in a room that was used in the mornings as a sitting room, with an air of infinite boredom.</t3629>
<t3630>—I'm sorry, Harry —exclaimed the boy—, but it's actually been your fault.</t3630> <t3631>The book you lent me is so fascinating that time just flew by.</t3631>
<t3632>—Yes; I thought you might like it —replied his host, rising from his seat.</t3632>
<t3633>—I didn't say I like it, Harry.</t3633> <t3634>I said it fascinates me.</t3634> <t3635>There's a big difference.</t3635>
<t3636>—Ah, have you already made that discovery? —murmured Lord Henry, as they headed towards the dining room.</t3636>
<t3637>Chapter 11</t3637>
<t3638>For years, Dorian Gray could not rid himself of the influence of that book.</t3638> <t3639>Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that he never tried to do so.</t3639> <t3640>He ordered at least nine copies of the first edition from Paris, printed on large paper with very wide margins, and had them bound in different colors, so that they would match his various moods and the changing whims of a sensitivity over which, at times, he seemed to have almost completely lost control.</t3640> <t3641>The protagonist, the astonishing young Parisian whose romantic and scientific temperaments were so strangely combined, became a prefiguration of himself.</t3641> <t3642>And, in fact, the entire book seemed to him to contain the story of his life, written before he had lived it.</t3642>
<t3643>There was, however, one point in which he was more fortunate than the fantastic protagonist of the novel.</t3643> <t3644>He never suffered the somewhat grotesque terror —never, in fact, had any reason for it— that mirrors, the shiny surfaces of metals, and still water inspired in the young Parisian from an early age, a terror caused by the sudden disappearance of a beauty that once, apparently, had been extraordinarily striking.</t3644> <t3645>Dorian Gray used to read, with an almost cruel joy —and perhaps in almost all joys, as undoubtedly in all pleasures, cruelty has its place— the last part of the book, with its truly tragic account, although to some extent overly emphasized, of the pain and despair of someone who had lost what he valued above all in other people and in the world.</t3645>
<t3646>Because the singular beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward and many others never seemed to abandon him.</t3646> <t3647>Even those who had heard the worst about him —and periodically strange rumors about his way of life circulated through London and became the talk of the clubs— did not believe them if they met him in person.</t3647> <t3648>Dorian Gray retained the appearance of someone who had kept away from the world's vileness.</t3648> <t3649>Coarse conversations would cease when he entered a room.</t3649> <t3650>There was a purity in his face that had all the force of a reproach.</t3650> <t3651>His mere presence seemed to awaken the memory of a tarnished innocence.</t3651> <t3652>Everyone wondered how someone so attractive and pure had escaped the corruption of an age that was both sordid and sensual.</t3652>
<t3653>Frequently, upon returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjectures among those who were, or believed themselves to be, his friends, Dorian Gray would slip upstairs to the locked attic room, open the door with the key that never left his person, and position himself, with a mirror, in front of the portrait painted by Basil Hallward, sometimes looking at the wicked and aged face on the canvas and other times at the ever-young and handsome features that laughed at him from the bright surface of the glass.</t3653> <t3654>The very sharpness of the contrast increased his pleasure.</t3654> <t3655>He became more and more enamored with the beauty of his body and increasingly interested in the corruption of his soul.</t3655> <t3656>He would examine with meticulous care, and sometimes with monstrous and terrible joy, the dreadful furrows that cut across his wrinkled forehead and crawled around the sensual mouth, now devoid of all charm, sometimes wondering what was more horrible, the marks of sin or those of age.</t3656> <t3657>He would also place his pearly hands next to the rough and swollen hands of the painting, and smile.</t3657> <t3658>He mocked the deformed body and the faltering limbs.</t3658>
<t3659>At night, sleepless in his bedroom, always perfumed with delicate aromas, or in the sordid room of a tavern of very bad repute near the docks, which he habitually frequented in disguise and under a false name, there were moments, indeed, when he thought about the destruction of his soul with a compassion that was especially pathetic because it was purely selfish.</t3659> <t3660>But those moments were not frequent.</t3660> <t3661>The curiosity about life, which Lord Henry had first awakened in him when they were in his friend Basil's garden, seemed to grow as it was satisfied.</t3661> <t3662>The more he knew, the more he wanted to know.</t3662> <t3663>He suffered from mad hungers that became more devouring the better he fed them.</t3663>
<t3664>He did not let himself go completely, however, at least in his relations with good society.</t3664> <t3665>Once or twice a month during the winter, and on Wednesday afternoons during the season, he opened the doors of his magnificent house to the world and hired the most celebrated musicians of the moment to delight his guests with the wonders of their art.</t3665> <t3666>His intimate dinners, in whose organization Lord Henry always collaborated, were famous for the careful selection and distribution of the guests, as well as for the exquisite taste in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangement of exotic flowers, embroidered tablecloths, and ancient gold and silver tableware.</t3666> <t3667>There were indeed many, especially among the younger ones, who saw, or imagined they saw, in Dorian Gray the true embodiment of a model they had often dreamed of in their days at Eton and Oxford, a person who somehow combined the culture of the scholar with the charm, distinction, and perfect manners of a citizen of the world.</t3667> <t3668>It seemed to them that he was part of the group of those whom Dante describes as trying to "make themselves perfect through the worship of beauty[1]".</t3668> <t3669>Like Gautier, he was someone for whom "the visible world existed[2]".</t3669>
<t3670>For him, certainly, Life was the first and greatest of the arts, and all the others were merely a preparation for it.</t3670> <t3671>Fashion, through which the purely fantastic becomes universal for a moment, and dandyism, which in its own way tries to affirm the absolute modernity of beauty, fascinated him.</t3671> <t3672>His manner of dressing and the peculiar styles he occasionally advocated had a marked influence on the elegant young men who could be seen at Mayfair balls or behind the windows of the Pall Mall clubs, and who copied everything Dorian Gray did, striving to reproduce the fleeting charm of his graceful coquetries, which, for him, never became entirely serious.</t3672>
<t3673>Because, although he was fully willing to accept the privileged position that was offered to him almost immediately upon reaching adulthood, and found a subtle pleasure in the idea that he could truly become for the London of his time what the author of the Satyricon had once been for Nero's imperial Rome, in the innermost part of his soul he wished to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, consulted on how to wear a jewel, how to tie a tie, or how to handle a cane.</t3673> <t3674>Dorian Gray sought to invent a new way of living that rested on a reasoned philosophy and well-organized principles, and that found its highest goal in the spiritualization of the senses.</t3674>
<t3675>The worship of the senses has frequently and justly been censured, because human nature makes one instinctively fear passions and sensations that seem stronger than oneself, and which one is aware of sharing with lower forms of the organic world.</t3675> <t3676>But Dorian Gray considered that the true nature of the senses had never been well understood, that they had remained in a wild and animalistic state simply because the world had tried to subdue them through hunger and kill them through pain, instead of aiming to transform them into elements of a new spirituality, in which the dominant trait would be an admirable instinct for perceiving beauty.</t3676> <t3677>When contemplating the path humanity had traveled since the dawn of history, he was overcome with a feeling of regret.</t3677> <t3678>There had been so many capitulations!</t3678> <t3679>And with such scant results!</t3679> <t3680>There had been senseless rejections, monstrous forms of mortification, of self-torture, whose origin was fear and whose result was an infinitely more terrible degradation than the imaginary degradation from which humanity, in its ignorance, had tried to escape.</t3680> <t3681>Nature, using its wonderful irony, pushed the anchorite to feed on the wild animals of the desert and gave the hermit the beasts of the field as companions.</t3681>
<t3682>Yes; there had to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new hedonism that would recreate life, that would save it from that coarse and violent puritanism that is having a strange resurgence in our era.</t3682> <t3683>A hedonism that would undoubtedly use the services of intelligence, but without accepting any theory or system that implied the sacrifice of any form of passionate experience.</t3683> <t3684>Its objective, indeed, was the experience itself and not the fruits of the experience, both sweet and bitter.</t3684> <t3685>It would dispense with the asceticism that stifles the senses and the vulgar shamelessness that dulls them.</t3685> <t3686>But it would teach the human being to concentrate on the singular moments of a life that is in itself nothing more than a moment.</t3686>
<t3687>There are very few among us who have not sometimes woken up before dawn, or after one of those dreamless nights that almost make us love death, or one of those nights of horror and monstrous joy, when ghosts more terrible than reality itself stir in the chambers of the brain, brimming with that intense life, inseparable from all that is grotesque, which gives Gothic art its imperishable vitality, since that art seems to belong above all to spirits tormented by the sickness of dreams.</t3687> <t3688>Little by little, bloodless fingers emerge from behind the curtains and seem to tremble.</t3688> <t3689>Adopting fantastic dark shapes, silent shadows creep into the corners of the room to crouch there.</t3689> <t3690>Outside, one hears the rustling of birds among the leaves, or the noises made by men heading to work, or the sighs and sobs of the wind descending from the mountains and wandering around the silent house, as if fearing to wake those who sleep, though it is compelled to drag sleep out of its purple cave at all costs.</t3690> <t3691>One by one, the veils of delicate black gauze lift, things gradually regain form and color, and we see how the dawn restores the world to its pristine appearance.</t3691> <t3692>The livid mirrors regain their imitation of life.</t3692> <t3693>The extinguished candles remain where we left them, and beside them rests the half-open book we intended to study, or the prepared flower we wore to the dance, or the letter we did not dare to read or have read too many times.</t3693> <t3694>Nothing seems to have changed.</t3694> <t3695>From the unreal shadows of the night, the real life we knew is reborn.</t3695> <t3696>We must continue where we had been interrupted, and at that moment we are overwhelmed by a terrible feeling, the need to vigorously continue the same exhausting cycle of stereotyped habits, or perhaps, sometimes, the mad desire that our eyes might open one morning to a world remodeled overnight to please us, a world in which things would have newly invented forms and colors, and would be different, or hide other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no value, or would survive, in any case, without a conscious sense of obligation or remorse, since even the memory of a joy has its bitterness, and the memory of a pleasure, its pain.</t3696>
<t3697>To Dorian Gray, it seemed that the creation of worlds like those was the true goal or, at least, one of the true goals of life; and in his quest for sensations that were at the same time new and pleasurable, and possessed that component of the unknown which is so essential for daydreaming, he often adopted certain modes of thought that he knew were really foreign to his nature, surrendering to their subtle influence, and then, after soaking up, so to speak, their color, and once his natural curiosity was satisfied, he abandoned them with that curious indifference which is not incompatible with a truly passionate temperament, and which, in fact, according to certain modern psychologists, is frequently its indispensable condition.</t3697>
<t3698>On one occasion it was rumored that he was about to convert to Catholicism; and, of course, the Roman ritual had always greatly attracted him.</t3698> <t3699>The daily sacrifice of the mass, more terribly real than all the sacrifices of the ancient world, moved him as much by its supreme disdain for the testimony of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy it sought to symbolize.</t3699> <t3700>He liked to kneel on the cold marble floor and watch the priest, with his stiff, flowered chasuble, slowly part the veil of the tabernacle with his ivory hands, and raise the monstrance with the pale host that sometimes, one would like to believe, is truly the panis caelestis, the food of angels; or, adorned with the attributes of Christ's passion, break the sacred form and strike his chest to ask for the remission of all sins.</t3700> <t3701>The smoking censers, which the solemn altar boys, with their lace and scarlet cassocks, swung into the air like great golden flowers, exerted a subtle fascination over Dorian Gray.</t3701> <t3702>Upon leaving the church, he would gaze in wonder at the black confessionals, and he would have liked to sit inside one of them to listen to men and women whisper through the worn grille the true story of their lives.</t3702>
<t3703>But he never made the mistake of halting his intellectual development by officially accepting any creed or system, nor by turning a temporary inn into a permanent dwelling, an inn that is only convenient for spending a day or a few hours of a starless night when the moon is in labor.</t3703> <t3704>Mysticism, with its wonderful power to make ordinary things strange, and the subtle antinomianism [3] that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for another season he inclined towards the materialistic doctrines of the German Darwinist movement and found a curious pleasure in tracing back the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in their brain, or to some whitish nerve in their body, enchanted with the idea that the spirit depended absolutely on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or pathological.</t3704> <t3705>However, as has already been said of him, no theory about life seemed important to him compared to life itself.</t3705> <t3706>He was very aware of the sterility of all intellectual speculation if separated from action and experience.</t3706> <t3707>He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, had spiritual mysteries to reveal.</t3707>
<t3708>For this reason, he devoted himself for some time to the study of perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling intensely aromatic oils, and burning fragrant gums from the East, which allowed him to realize that there was no state of mind that did not have a correspondence in the life of the senses, dedicating himself to discovering their true relationships, wondering why incense drives mysticism, why ambergris unleashes passions, why violet awakens the memory of dead loves, and why musk disturbs the brain and champac [4] the imagination, repeatedly trying to develop a true psychology of perfumes, and to calculate the various influences of roots possessing soft scents, pollen-laden flowers, or aromatic balms, dark and fragrant woods, spikenard that induces nausea, hovenia that drives one mad, and aloes that are said to expel melancholy from the soul.</t3708>
<t3709>In another era, he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a spacious room with lattices, a vermilion and gold ceiling, and walls lacquered in olive green, he gave curious concerts where frenzied gypsies drew wild music from tiny zithers, or serious Tunisians dressed in yellow plucked the tense strings of monstrous lutes, while smiling black men monotonously beat copper drums and slender turbaned Indians, cross-legged on scarlet mats, played long flutes made of cane or bronze and charmed, or pretended to charm, large cobras and horrible horned vipers.</t3709><t3710>The syncopated rhythms and the strident dissonances of those barbaric musics moved him at times when the charm of Schubert, the beautiful sorrows of Chopin, and even the majestic harmonies of Beethoven himself failed to make an impression on his ear.</t3710><t3711>He gathered, from all parts of the world, the strangest instruments that can be found, both from the tombs of vanished peoples and among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and he enjoyed playing and testing them.</t3711><t3712>He possessed the mysterious juruparis of the Indians of the Rio Negro, instruments that women are not allowed to look at and that even young men can only see after undergoing fasting and self-mortification; the clay vessels of the Peruvians from which they extract sharp bird-like cries, and flutes made from human bones, like those Alfonso de Ovalle [5] heard in Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers found near Cuzco that produce notes of singular sweetness.</t3712><t3713>Dorian Gray possessed painted gourds, filled with pebbles, that resonated when shaken; the long clarion of the Mexicans, in which the player does not blow but inhales air through it; the crude ture of the Amazonian tribes, sounded by sentinels who remain all day in tall trees and can be heard, it is said, from a distance of three leagues; the teponaztli, made of two vibrating wooden slabs, struck with sticks covered with the elastic gum obtained from the milky sap of certain plants; the yotl bells of the Aztecs, hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of large snakes, like the one Bernal Díaz del Castillo saw when he entered the Mexican temple with Cortés, and whose plaintive sound he described so graphically.</t3713>
<t3714>The fantastic nature of those instruments fascinated him, and the idea that art, like nature, has its monsters, creatures of beastly form and hateful voices, gave him a curious pleasure.</t3714> <t3715>However, after some time, he grew tired of them and returned to his box at the opera, either alone or in the company of Lord Henry, to listen to Tannhäuser with deep pleasure, seeing in the prelude of that great work an interpretation of the tragedy of his soul.</t3715>
<t3716>On another occasion, he undertook the study of jewels and attended a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse[6], Admiral of France, wearing a suit covered with five hundred and sixty pearls.</t3716> <t3717>This hobby captivated him for years and it can be said, in fact, that it never left him.</t3717> <t3718>He often spent an entire day arranging and rearranging in their cases the different stones he had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red in the light of a lamp, the cymophane, crossed by a silver line, the peridot, pistachio green in color, pink or golden topazes like wine, fiercely scarlet carbuncles with trembling four-pointed stars, fiery red Ceylon garnets, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternating layers of ruby and sapphire.</t3718> <t3719>He loved the golden red of the sunstone and the pearly whiteness of the moonstone, as well as the broken rainbow of the milky opal.</t3719> <t3720>He acquired in Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of color, and he owned a turquoise from the vieille roche[7] that was the envy of all connoisseurs.</t3720>
<t3721>He also discovered marvelous stories about jewels.</t3721> <t3722>In his Disciplina Clericales, Pedro Alfonso [8] mentions a serpent with eyes of genuine hyacinth, and in the romanticized life of Alexander, it is said of the conqueror of Emathia that he found in the valley of the Jordan serpents "on whose backs grew necklaces of true emeralds."</t3722> <t3723>There exists, Philostratus tells us, a precious stone in the brain of the dragon and "if shown golden letters and a scarlet robe," the monster falls into a magical sleep and can be killed.</t3723> <t3724>According to the great alchemist Pierre de Boniface, the diamond provides invisibility, and the agate of India, eloquence.</t3724> <t3725>Carnelian calms anger, hyacinth invites sleep, and amethyst dispels the vapors of wine.</t3725> <t3726>Garnet drives away demons, and hydropicus deprives the moon of its color.</t3726> <t3727>Selenite grows and wanes with the moon, and meloceo, the discoverer of thieves, is only affected by the blood of the kid goat.</t3727> <t3728>Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone, an infallible antidote against poison, extracted from a freshly dead toad.</t3728> <t3729>The bezoar, found in the heart of the Arabian deer, is a charm that can cure the plague.</t3729> <t3730>In the nests of the birds of Arabia, there is the aspilates which, according to Democritus, protects its bearer from all danger of fire.</t3730>
<t3731>The king of Ceylon, during his coronation ceremony, rode through his capital on horseback with a large ruby in his hand.</t3731> <t3732>The doors of Prester John's palace "were made of sardonyx, inlaid with little horns of cerastes or horned viper, so that no one could introduce poisons inside."</t3732> <t3733>On the gable, there were "two golden apples with two carbuncles," so that the gold would shine by day and the carbuncles by night.</t3733> <t3734>In Lodge's strange novel, A Margarite of America, it is stated that in the queen's chamber one could see "all the chaste ladies of the world, in silver reliquaries, who looked at those who gazed at them through beautiful mirrors of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and green emeralds."</t3734> <t3735>Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Cipango place pink pearls in the mouths of the deceased.</t3735> <t3736>A sea monster was in love with the pearl that the diver brought to King Peroz, so it killed the thief and mourned for seven moons because of its loss.</t3736> <t3737>When the Huns managed to lure the king into a great pit, the monarch threw it far away —as Procopius recounts— and it was never found again, despite Emperor Anastasius offering a reward of five hundred quintals of gold pieces.</t3737> <t3738>The king of Malabar had shown a Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for each god he worshipped.</t3738>
<t3739>When the Duke of Valentinois[9], son of Alexander VI, visited Louis XII, his horse, Brantôme tells us, was laden with gold leaves, and his cap was adorned with two rows of dazzling rubies.</t3739> <t3740>Charles of England, when he rode a horse, wore spurs adorned with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds.</t3740> <t3741>Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies of purple color.</t3741> <t3742>Hall described Henry VIII, on his way to the Tower of London before his coronation, with "a robe embroidered in gold, the doublet embroidered with diamonds and other precious stones, and around his neck, a large collar of great balas rubies."</t3742> <t3743>The favorites of James I wore earrings made of emeralds mounted in gold filigree.</t3743> <t3744>Edward II gave Piers Gaveston a red gold armor studded with hyacinths, a collar of gold roses with turquoise, and a cap sprinkled with pearls.</t3744> <t3745>Henry II used jeweled gloves that reached up to his elbow, and he owned a falconry glove adorned with twelve rubies and fifty-two large Oriental pearls.</t3745> <t3746>From the ducal hat of Charles the Bold, the last Duke of Burgundy of his lineage, studded with sapphires, hung pear-shaped pearls.</t3746>
<t3747>How exquisite life was in times past!</t3747> <t3748>What magnificence in the pomp and ornamentation!</t3748> <t3749>The mere reading of what luxury was like in the past was astonishing.</t3749>
<t3750>Dorian Gray later became interested in the embroideries and tapestries that served as frescoes in the cold halls of the northern nations of Europe.</t3750><t3751>While researching the subject —and he always had the extraordinary ability to immerse himself completely, when the time came, in the subject he was tackling— it almost saddened him to reflect on the ravages that Time causes in everything that is beautiful and extraordinary.</t3751><t3752>He, at least, had escaped that doom.</t3752><t3753>Summers came and went, the golden daffodils had bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of his infamy, but Dorian remained the same.</t3753><t3754>Winter did not spoil his complexion nor wither the splendor of his youth.</t3754><t3755>How different it was with material things!</t3755><t3756>What had become of them?</t3756><t3757>Where was the great saffron-colored cloak, woven by dark-haired maidens to please Athena, for which the gods had fought against the giants?</t3757><t3758>Where was the immense velarium that Nero had spread over the Roman Colosseum, that titanic purple sail on which the starry sky was depicted, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white steeds with golden reins?</t3758><t3759>Dorian longed to see the curious napkins made for the Priest of the Sun, on which all the delicacies and viands that could be desired for a feast were depicted; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the extravagant tunics that aroused the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, where "lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters: everything that, in fact, a painter can copy from nature" were depicted; and the doublet once worn by Charles of Orleans, on whose sleeves the lyrics of a song that began with "Madame, je suis tout joyeux" were embroidered, with the musical accompaniment of the words in gold thread, and each note, square in those times, formed by four pearls.</t3759><t3760>Dorian also learned of the room prepared in the palace of Reims to house Queen Joan of Burgundy, decorated with "one thousand three hundred and twenty-one parrots adorned with royal arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings similarly bore the queen's arms, all worked in gold."</t3760><t3761>Catherine de' Medici had a funeral bed prepared of black velvet studded with crescents and suns.</t3761><t3762>Its curtains were of damask, adorned with leafy crowns and garlands on a background of gold and silver, the edges decorated with pearl embroidery, which was placed in a room whose ceiling hung rows of the queen's mottos in black velvet on silver cloth.</t3762><t3763>Louis XIV had, in his apartments, caryatids embroidered in gold fifteen feet high.</t3763><t3764>The gala bed of John III Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of gold brocade from Smyrna on which verses from the Koran were written in turquoise.</t3764><t3765>The supports were of gilded silver, beautifully chiseled, and profusely adorned with enameled and jeweled medallions.</t3765><t3766>It was a war trophy, taken from the Turkish camp during the siege of Vienna, and the banner of Muhammad had fluttered in the wind under the vibrant golds of its canopy.</t3766>
<t3767>And so, for a whole year, Dorian strove to accumulate the most exquisite specimens of fabrics and embroideries: delicate muslins from Delhi, exquisitely worked with palm decorations in gold thread and studded with iridescent beetle wings; gauzes from Dacca, which, due to their transparency, are known in the East as "woven air" and "flowing water," and also as "night dew"; fabrics from Java with strange figures; very refined yellow tapestries from China; books bound in tawny satin or beautiful blue silks, and adorned with fleur-de-lis, birds, and images; lacis veils woven with Hungarian stitch; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian fabrics with their golden coins, and Japanese fukusas with their golden green tones and their birds of marvelous plumage.</t3767>
<t3768>He also felt a special passion for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed for everything related to the service of the Church.</t3768> <t3769>In the long cedar chests, arranged along the west gallery of his house, he had stored a large number of rare and superb specimens of what is truly the attire of the Bride of Christ, who must adorn herself with purple, jewels, and the finest linen to hide her pale body, mortified, worn out by the suffering she seeks and wounded by the pains she inflicts upon herself.</t3769> <t3770>Dorian owned a sumptuous crimson silk and damask cope with gold thread, in which pomegranates repeated a stylized motif of six-petaled flowers, with the emblem of the pineapple reproduced in fine pearls on either side.</t3770> <t3771>The orphreys were divided into panels depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin, and her coronation was embroidered in colored silks on the hood.</t3771> <t3772>It was an Italian work from the 15th century.</t3772> <t3773>Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with groups of heart-shaped acanthus leaves, from which long-stemmed white flowers emerged, worked in silver thread and colored crystals.</t3773> <t3774>The clasp featured a seraph's head embroidered in relief with gold thread.</t3774> <t3775>The orphreys were woven in a red and gold silk damask, and constellated with medallions of many martyrs and saints, among whom was Saint Sebastian.</t3775> <t3776>He also acquired chasubles of amber silk, blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow damask silk and cloth of gold, with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs-de-lis; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice veils, and shrouds.</t3776> <t3777>There was something in the mystical use assigned to those objects that stimulated his imagination.</t3777>
<t3778>Because those treasures and everything he collected in his beautiful mansion were meant to serve as a means of forgetting, they were a way to escape, for a time, the fear that sometimes seemed almost too intense for him to bear.</t3778> <t3779>On a wall of the solitary room, always locked, where he had spent such a considerable part of his childhood and adolescence, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the true degradation of his life, and in front of it, as a curtain, he had placed the mortuary cloth of purple and gold.</t3779> <t3780>He would spend weeks without going up, forgetting that dreadful painting, regaining the lightness of spirit, the wonderful joy of living, letting himself be passionately absorbed by existence itself.</t3780> <t3781>Then, suddenly, on any given night, he would stealthily leave his house, go down to some of the dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there for several days until he was thrown out.</t3781> <t3782>Upon returning home, he would sit in front of the portrait, sometimes hating it and hating himself, but at other times letting himself be dominated by that proud individualism that constitutes much of the fascination of sin, and he would smile, secretly pleased, at the deformed image, condemned to bear the burden that should have fallen upon his shoulders.</t3782>
<t3783>After a few years, it became impossible for him to spend much time outside of England, and he gave up the villa he had shared in Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the white house in Algiers, isolated by a high wall, where they had spent more than one winter.</t3783> <t3784>He could not live far from the portrait that was such an essential element of his life, and he also feared that, during his absence, someone might enter the room, despite the complicated locks he had installed.</t3784>
<t3785>He realized, on the other hand, quite clearly, that the portrait would reveal nothing.</t3785> <t3786>It was true that it still retained, beneath the vileness and ugliness of the face, a considerable resemblance to the original; but what consequences could be drawn from that?</t3786> <t3787>Dorian Gray would laugh at anyone who tried to use it against him.</t3787> <t3788>He had not painted it.</t3788> <t3789>What did he care about the vile and abject appearance?</t3789> <t3790>Even if it revealed the truth, who would believe it?</t3790>
<t3791>But that did not stop him from feeling afraid.</t3791> <t3792>Sometimes, when he was in the grand family mansion in Nottinghamshire, where he entertained the young gentlemen of his social standing who were his usual companions, and where he astonished the entire county with the gratuitous luxury and excessive opulence of his way of living, he would suddenly abandon his guests to rush back to the capital and check that no one had forced the door and that the portrait was still in its place.</t3792> <t3793>What would happen if someone stole it?</t3793> <t3794>The mere possibility chilled him with horror.</t3794> <t3795>Undoubtedly, the world would then come to know his secret.</t3795> <t3796>Perhaps the world already suspected it.</t3796>
<t3797>Because, although it was true that he fascinated many, there were already quite a few people who distrusted him.</t3797> <t3798>They almost denied him admission to a West End club, despite his birth and social position fully justifying a positive response; it was also said that, on one occasion, when one of his friends took him to the smoking room at the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman stood up very conspicuously and left.</t3798> <t3799>Curious stories about him began to become frequent once he turned twenty-five.</t3799> <t3800>It was rumored that he had been seen fighting with foreign sailors in a disreputable establishment in the depths of Whitechapel, and also that he associated with thieves and counterfeiters and knew all the secrets of their trades.</t3800> <t3801>His surprising absences became famous, and when he reappeared in good society, people whispered in corners, or let out mocking laughter as he passed by, or looked at him with cold, questioning eyes, as if they were determined to uncover his secret.</t3801>
<t3802>Dorian Gray, of course, paid no attention whatsoever to such insolences and deliberate scorns and, in the opinion of most, his naturalness and jovial air, his charming adolescent smile and the infinite grace of the wonderful youth that seemed never to abandon him, were in themselves a sufficient response to the slanders, because that is how most people described them, that circulated about him.</t3802> <t3803>It was noted, however, that some of the people with whom he had had a more intimate relationship seemed, after some time, to avoid him.</t3803> <t3804>Women who showed towards him an unlimited adoration, who defied society's censure for him and disregarded all conventions, would pale with shame and horror if Dorian Gray entered the room where they were.</t3804>
<t3805>Those whispered scandals only served, however, in the eyes of many, to heighten his strange and dangerous charm.</t3805> <t3806>His great fortune was, undoubtedly, an element of security.</t3806> <t3807>Society, at least civilized society, is never very willing to believe anything to the detriment of those who are, at the same time, rich and fascinating.</t3807> <t3808>It feels, instinctively, that manners are more important than morals and, in its opinion, the most unblemished respectability is worth far less than the possession of a good chef.</t3808> <t3809>And, to tell the truth, it is very little consolation to know that the person who invites you to an execrable dinner or serves you poor quality wine is irreproachable in their private life.</t3809> <t3810>Not even the cardinal virtues justify semi-cold entrées, as Lord Henry once remarked in a debate on that subject; and there are undoubtedly excellent reasons to support that point of view.</t3810> <t3811>Because the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art.</t3811> <t3812>Form is absolutely essential.</t3812> <t3813>Social life should have the dignity of a ceremony, and also its unreality, and combine the insincerity of a romantic comedy with the wit and beauty that endow it with charm for us.</t3813> <t3814>Is insincerity such a terrible thing?</t3814> <t3815>I don't think so.</t3815> <t3816>It is, simply, a method that allows us to multiply our personalities.</t3816>
<t3817>Such was, at least, the opinion of Dorian Gray, who marveled at the superficiality of those psychologists for whom the Self is something simple, permanent, reliable, and unique.</t3817><t3818>For him, man was a being endowed with innumerable lives and sensations, a complex and multiform creature that harbored curious inheritances of thoughts and passions, and whose very flesh was infected by the monstrous ailments of the dead.</t3818><t3819>He enjoyed walking through the cold corridor of his ancestral home where the family portraits were stored, to contemplate the different portraits of those whose blood ran through his veins.</t3819><t3820>There was Philip Herbert, of whom Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, tells us that he was "spoiled by the court due to his good looks, although his handsome face did not accompany him for long."</t3820><t3821>Was the life he led similar to that of young Herbert?</t3821><t3822>Had some strange poisonous germ passed from organism to organism until it finally reached his?</t3822><t3823>Was the confused feeling of that lost grace what had driven him, so suddenly and almost without reason, to utter, in Basil Hallward's studio, the foolish prayer that had changed his life?</t3823><t3824>And there, with his red doublet embroidered in gold, jeweled coat, ruff, and cuffs with golden edges, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with black and silver armor at his feet.</t3824><t3825>What had Dorian inherited from that man?</t3825><t3826>The lover of Giovanna of Naples, had he bequeathed him some sin, some infamy?</t3826><t3827>Were his actions nothing more than the dreams that the dead had not dared to carry out?</t3827><t3828>There, from the muted-colored canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, with her gauze hood, pearl breastplate, and slashed pink sleeves.</t3828><t3829>A flower in her right hand, and in her left an enameled necklace of white and damasked roses.</t3829><t3830>On a table beside her rested a mandolin and an apple.</t3830><t3831>And large rosettes on her pointed little shoes.</t3831><t3832>Dorian knew of her life, and the strange stories told about her lovers.</t3832><t3833>Was there something of her temperament in him?</t3833><t3834>Her almond-shaped eyes with heavy lids seemed to look at him with curiosity.</t3834><t3835>And what about George Willoughby, with his powdered wig and extravagant beauty spots?</t3835><t3836>How wicked he seemed!</t3836><t3837>The sullen, dark face, and the sensual lips that formed a sneer of disdain.</t3837><t3838>Delicate lace cuffs fell over the long yellowish hands too laden with rings.</t3838><t3839>He had been a dandy of the 18th century, and a friend, in his youth, of Lord Ferrars.</t3839><t3840>And the second Lord Beckenham, companion of the Prince Regent in his wildest years, and one of the witnesses to his secret marriage to Mrs. Fitzherbert?</t3840><t3841>How proud and handsome, with his chestnut curls and his swashbuckling pose!</t3841><t3842>What passions had he bequeathed him?</t3842><t3843>The world attributed all infamies to him.</t3843><t3844>He had undoubtedly directed the orgies of Carlton House.</t3844><t3845>But on his chest shone the star of the Garter.</t3845><t3846>Next to his could be seen the portrait of his wife, a pale woman dressed in black, with very thin lips.</t3846><t3847>That blood also ran through Dorian's veins.</t3847><t3848>How curious it all seemed!</t3848><t3849>And his mother, with a face like Lady Hamilton and fresh lips, moistened by wine: Dorian knew what he had received from her.</t3849><t3850>She had passed on her beauty to him, and the passion for the beauty of others.</t3850><t3851>She laughed at him with her loose Bacchante dress.</t3851><t3852>There were vine leaves in her hair.</t3852><t3853>The cup she held spilled purple.</t3853><t3854>The carnations in the painting had withered, but the eyes remained marvelous for their depth and the magic of their color.</t3854><t3855>And they seemed to follow him wherever he went.</t3855>
<t3856>But one also has literary ancestors, in addition to those of one's own lineage, many of whom might be closer in constitution and temperament, and with an influence that was much more clearly recognized.</t3856> <t3857>There were times when it seemed to Dorian Gray that the entirety of history was nothing more than the story of his own life, not as he had lived it in his actions and details, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had existed in his mind and passions.</t3857> <t3858>He felt as if he had known them all, those strange and terrible figures who had traversed the great theater of the world, making sin something so marvelous and evil something so subtle.</t3858> <t3859>It seemed to him that, in some mysterious way, their lives had also been his own.</t3859>
<t3860>The protagonist himself of the wonderful novel that had so greatly influenced his life had that curious impression.</t3860> <t3861>In the seventh chapter, it recounts how, crowned with laurel to avoid being struck by lightning, he had been Tiberius, who read, in a garden in Capri, the scandalous works of the Greek author Elefantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strolled around him, and the flutist imitated the to-and-fro of the censer; he had been Caligula, carousing in the stables with grooms in green livery before dining in an ivory manger next to a horse with a jewel-covered forehead; and Domitian, wandering through a corridor with marble mirrors, searching everywhere with feverish eyes for the reflection of a dagger destined to end his days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible taedium vitae, the common fate of all those to whom life has denied nothing; later, he had also witnessed, through a transparent emerald, the bloody carnages of the Circus only to then, in a litter of pearls and purple, drawn by mules with silver shoes, return, via the street of the Pomegranates, to the Golden House, while, as he passed, the inhabitants of Rome acclaimed Caesar Nero; he had been Heliogabalus, his face painted with colors, working at the distaff among the women, and who brought the Moon from Carthage to give it to the Sun in a mystical marriage.</t3861>
<t3862>Dorian read that fantastic chapter over and over again, and the two following ones, which presented, as certain unique tapestries or certain strangely crafted enamels do, the thrilling and splendid forms of those whom Vice and Blood and Boredom turned into monsters or madmen: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who murdered his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison so that her lover would sip the destruction of the dead creature he caressed; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known by the name of Paul II[10], who, in his vanity, wanted to claim the title of Fermosus, and whose y</t3862>
<t3863>tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the price of an abominable sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used bloodhounds to hunt men, and whose body, when murdered, was covered with roses by a courtesan who had loved him; the Borgia on his white steed, and the Fratricide riding beside him, with the cloak stained by Perotto's blood; Pietro Riario, the young cardinal archbishop of Florence, son and favorite of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was only matched by his debauchery, who received Eleanor of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and who covered a young boy with gold leaf to play the role, for the occasion, of Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelino, whose melancholy was only cured by the spectacle of death and who had a passion for blood, as other men have for red wine; son of the Evil One, it was said, who had cheated his infernal father when gambling his soul with dice; Giambattista Cibo, who, mockingly, took the name of Innocent, and into whose lethargic veins a Jewish doctor injected the blood of three youths; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned in Rome as an enemy of God and men, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, gave Ginevra poison in an emerald cup, and, wishing to honor a shameful passion, built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, so terribly in love with his brother's wife that a leper warned him of the madness that was approaching and who, when his brain became ill and he began to rave, could only be calmed with Saracen cards, illustrated with images of Love, Death, and Madness; and, with his elegant doublet, jeweled cap, and curls like acanthus leaves, Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre along with his betrothed, and Simonetto with his page, whose charm was such that, while he lay dying in the yellow square of Perugia, those who had hated him were moved to tears, and whom Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed.</t3863>
<t3864>Everyone awakened in Dorian a horrible fascination.</t3864> <t3865>He saw them at night and they disturbed him during the day.</t3865> <t3866>The Renaissance knew strange ways of poisoning: by means of a helmet and a lit torch; a embroidered glove and a jeweled fan; a perfumed cushion and an amber necklace.</t3866> <t3867>Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book.</t3867> <t3868>At certain moments he saw evil only as a means that allowed him to put into practice his conception of beauty.</t3868>
<t3869>Chapter 12</t3869>
<t3870>It was the ninth of November, the eve of his thirty-eighth birthday, as Dorian would often remember later.</t3870>
<t3871>He was returning from Lord Henry's house, where he had dined, around eleven, well wrapped in a fur coat, because the night was cold and foggy.</t3871> <t3872>At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, an individual walking very quickly, with the collar of his coat raised, crossed paths with him in the fog.</t3872> <t3873>In his hand, he was carrying a briefcase.</t3873> <t3874>Dorian recognized him.</t3874> <t3875>It was Basil Hallward.</t3875> <t3876>A strange, inexplicable sensation of fear dominated him.</t3876> <t3877>He made no gesture of recognition and continued walking briskly towards his house.</t3877>
<t3878>But Hallward had seen him.</t3878> <t3879>Dorian heard him first stop and then quicken his pace behind him.</t3879> <t3880>After a few moments, he felt his hand on his arm.</t3880>
<t3881>—Dorian! How lucky I am!</t3881> <t3882>I've been waiting for you in your library since nine o'clock.</t3882> <t3883>Finally, I took pity on your servant, who seemed very tired, and as he accompanied me to the door, I told him to go to bed.</t3883> <t3884>I'm leaving for Paris on the midnight train, and I was very interested in seeing you before then.</t3884> <t3885>I thought it was you or, rather, your fur coat, when you passed by me.</t3885> <t3886>But I wasn't sure.</t3886> <t3887>Didn't you recognize me?</t3887>
<t3888>—With this fog, my dear Basil?</t3888> <t3889>I am unable to recognize Grosvenor Square!</t3889> <t3890>I think my house is nearby, but I am not too sure either.</t3890> <t3891>I'm sorry you're leaving, because I haven't seen you in ages.</t3891> <t3892>But I suppose you'll be back soon.</t3892>
<t3893>—No; I will be away for six months.</t3893> <t3894>I plan to rent a studio in Paris and lock myself in until I finish a very important painting that I have in mind.</t3894> <t3895>But I don't want to talk about myself.</t3895> <t3896>We are already in front of your house.</t3896> <t3897>Allow me to come in for a moment.</t3897> <t3898>I have something to tell you.</t3898>
<t3899>—Delighted.</t3899> <t3900>But, won't you miss the train?</t3900> <t3901>—asked Dorian Gray languidly, as he climbed the entrance steps and opened the door with his key.</t3901>
<t3902>The light from the nearest streetlamp struggled to pierce through the fog, and Hallward checked his watch.</t3902>
<t3903>—I have plenty of time —he replied—.</t3903> <t3904>The train doesn't leave until a quarter past twelve and it's only eleven.</t3904> <t3905>In fact, I was heading to the club to see if I could find you there when we crossed paths.</t3905> <t3906>I won't have to wait for the luggage because I've already checked the trunks.</t3906> <t3907>All I have with me is this briefcase, and it won't take me more than twenty minutes to get to Victoria.</t3907>
<t3908>Dorian smiled, looking at him.</t3908>
<t3909>—What a way to travel for a famous painter!</t3909> <t3910>A briefcase and any old coat!</t3910> <t3911>Come in, or the fog will get into the house.</t3911> <t3912>And do me a favor, don't talk about anything serious.</t3912> <t3913>Nothing is serious in these times.</t3913> <t3914>At least, it shouldn't be.</t3914>
<t3915>Hallward shook his head as he entered and followed Dorian into the library.</t3915> <t3916>In the large fireplace, a cheerful wood fire was burning.</t3916> <t3917>The lamps were lit, and on top of a marquetry table rested an open Dutch silver liquor cabinet, with some siphons and tall cut-glass glasses.</t3917>
<t3918>—As you can see, your servant couldn't have treated me better.</t3918> <t3919>He gave me everything I wanted, including your best cigarettes with the golden filter.</t3919> <t3920>He is a very hospitable person.</t3920> <t3921>I like him much more than that Frenchman you had before.</t3921> <t3922>By the way, what happened to him?</t3922>
<t3923>Dorian shrugged his shoulders.</t3923>
<t3924>—I believe he married Lady Radley's maid, and has set her up in Paris as an English dressmaker.</t3924> <t3925>Anglomania is very fashionable there now, so they tell me.</t3925> <t3926>It seems a bit silly on the part of the French, don't you think?</t3926> <t3927>He wasn't really a bad servant at all.</t3927> <t3928>I never liked him, but I have no complaints.</t3928> <t3929>Sometimes one imagines very absurd things.</t3929> <t3930>He was fond of me and, as I understand it, he was very sorry to leave.</t3930> <t3931>Would you like another cognac?</t3931> <t3932>Or would you prefer Rhine wine with Seltzer water?</t3932> <t3933>That's what I always have.</t3933> <t3934>There is surely a bottle in the room next door.</t3934>
<t3935>—Thank you, I don't want anything else —said the painter, taking off his cap and coat, and throwing them over the briefcase he had left in a corner—.</t3935> <t3936>And now, my dear Dorian, we have to talk seriously.</t3936> <t3937>Don't frown.</t3937> <t3938>You make it much more difficult for me.</t3938>
<t3939>—What is it about? —exclaimed Dorian, not hiding his irritation, as he let himself fall onto the sofa—.</t3939> <t3940>I hope it has nothing to do with me.</t3940> <t3941>Tonight I am tired of myself.</t3941> <t3942>I would like to be someone else.</t3942>
<t3943>—It is about you —replied Hallward with a serious and resonant voice—, and I have no choice but to tell you.</t3943> <t3944>I only need half an hour.</t3944>
<t3945>Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette.</t3945> <t3946>"Half an hour!" he murmured.</t3946>
<t3947>—It is not too much that I ask of you, and I speak solely in your interest.</t3947> <t3948>I think it is fair for you to know that in London the most dreadful things are being said about you.</t3948>
<t3949>—I don't want to know anything about that.</t3949> <t3950>I love scandals about other people, but gossip that concerns me doesn't interest me.</t3950> <t3951>They lack the charm of novelty.</t3951>
<t3952>—They must interest you, Dorian.</t3952> <t3953>Every gentleman is interested in his good name.</t3953> <t3954>You cannot want people to speak of you as someone vile and depraved.</t3954> <t3955>You enjoy, of course, your position, and your fortune, and everything that comes with them.</t3955> <t3956>But position and fortune are not everything.</t3956> <t3957>I do not give any credit to those rumors.</t3957> <t3958>At least, I do not believe them when I see you.</t3958> <t3959>Sin is something that men wear on their faces.</t3959> <t3960>It cannot be hidden.</t3960> <t3961>People sometimes talk about secret vices.</t3961> <t3962>There is no such thing.</t3962> <t3963>If a poor wretch has a vice, it is revealed by the wrinkles around his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, even the shape of his hands.</t3963> <t3964>Someone, I will not say his name, but whom you know, came to me last year to have his portrait painted.</t3964> <t3965>I had never seen him before, nor had I heard anything about him at that time, although I have since learned many things.</t3965> <t3966>He offered me an exorbitant amount.</t3966> <t3967>I refused to paint him.</t3967> <t3968>There was something about the shape of his fingers that I found detestable.</t3968> <t3969>Now I know that the impression he gave me was not wrong.</t3969> <t3970>His life is a horror.</t3970> <t3971>But you, Dorian, with that innocent, luminous face of yours, with that wonderful youth of yours that remains ever the same, how can I believe anything bad about you?</t3971> <t3972>And yet I see you very rarely, you never come to the studio, and when I am away from you and hear all those hateful things that people whisper, I do not know what to say.</t3972> <t3973>Why, Dorian, does someone like the Duke of Berwick leave a club room when you enter it?</t3973> <t3974>Why are there so many gentlemen in London who neither go to your house nor invite you to theirs?</t3974> <t3975>You were very close friends with Lord Staveley.</t3975> <t3976>I met him at a dinner last week.</t3976> <t3977>Your name came up in conversation, regarding the miniatures you have lent for the exhibition at the Dudley Gallery.</t3977> <t3978>Staveley made a gesture of displeasure and said that you might have very artistic tastes, but that you should not be allowed to meet any pure young woman; and that no chaste woman should sit in the same room with you.</t3978> <t3979>I reminded him that I was your friend and asked him to explain what he meant.</t3979> <t3980>He did.</t3980> <t3981>He did it in front of everyone.</t3981> <t3982>It was horrible!</t3982> <t3983>Why is your friendship so disastrous for young men?</t3983> <t3984>There is the case of that unfortunate young man from the Guards who committed suicide.</t3984> <t3985>You were his close friend.</t3985> <t3986>I think of Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England, his reputation forever stained.</t3986> <t3987>You were inseparable.</t3987> <t3988>And what about Adrian Singleton, who ended in such a terrible way?</t3988> <t3989>And the only son of Lord Kent and his career?</t3989> <t3990>Yesterday I ran into his father in St. James Street.</t3990> <t3991>He seemed shattered by shame and sorrow.</t3991> <t3992>And the young Duke of Perth?</t3992> <t3993>What kind of life does he lead now?</t3993> <t3994>What gentleman would want to be seen with him?</t3994>
<t3995>—That's enough, Basil.</t3995> <t3996>You are talking about things you know nothing about —said Dorian Gray, biting his lips and with a tone of infinite contempt in his voice—.</t3996> <t3997>You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter.</t3997> <t3998>It is due to everything I know about his life, not what he knows about mine.</t3998> <t3999>With the blood he has in his veins, how could he be a person without blemish?</t3999> <t4000>You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth.</t4000> <t4001>Am I the one who taught them their vices and the other his debauchery?</t4001> <t4002>If the fool son of Kent goes to look for his wife in the gutter, what does that have to do with me?</t4002> <t4003>If Adrian Singleton acknowledges a debt by signing the promissory note with the name of one of his friends, am I his guardian?</t4003> <t4004>I know very well to what extent the English like to talk.</t4004> <t4005>The middle classes air their moral prejudices in their vulgar dining rooms, and murmur about what they call the depravity of the upper classes in order to make believe they belong to good society and are intimate with the people they slander.</t4005> <t4006>In this country, it is enough for a man to be distinguished and intelligent for all vulgar tongues to be unleashed against him.</t4006> <t4007>Tell me, what kind of life do all those people who claim to be the guardians of morality lead?</t4007> <t4008>My dear friend, you forget that we live in the country of hypocrisy.</t4008>
<t4009>—Dorian —exclaimed Hallward—, that is not the issue.</t4009> <t4010>England is not free from sin, I know, and English society has much to repent for.</t4010> <t4011>That is precisely the reason why I want you to be blameless.</t4011> <t4012>But you have not been.</t4012> <t4013>One can judge a person by the effect they have on their friends.</t4013> <t4014>Yours seem to completely lose their sense of honor, kindness, and purity.</t4014> <t4015>The only thing you transmit to them is an unbridled thirst for pleasure, and they do not stop until they reach the bottom of the abyss.</t4015> <t4016>But it is you who has led them there.</t4016> <t4017>Yes, it has been you, and yet you are still capable of smiling, as you are doing now.</t4017> <t4018>But there is still more.</t4018> <t4019>I know that Harry and you are inseparable.</t4019> <t4020>For that very reason, if for no other, you should not have allowed his sister to become the talk of the town.</t4020>
<t4021>—Careful, Basil.</t4021> <t4022>You are going too far.</t4022>
<t4023>—I must speak, and you have to listen to me.</t4023> <t4024>When you met Lady Gwendolen, not even the slightest shadow of scandal had touched her yet.</t4024> <t4025>But is there a single decent woman in London now willing to ride with her in the park?</t4025> <t4026>Not even her children are allowed to live with her!</t4026> <t4027>And then there are other rumors... rumors that say you have been seen sneaking out at dawn from dreadful houses and entering the most infamous dens in London in disguise.</t4027> <t4028>Are those rumors true?</t4028> <t4029>Can they be true?</t4029> <t4030>When I first heard them, I laughed.</t4030> <t4031>Now, when I hear them, they make me shudder.</t4031> <t4032>What about your house in the country and the life that is led there?</t4032> <t4033>You don't know what is said about you, Dorian.</t4033> <t4034>I'm not going to tell you that I don't want to lecture you.</t4034> <t4035>I remember how Harry once said that every man who, at a certain moment, decides to play the role of a priest, starts by saying that, and then proceeds to break his word.</t4035> <t4036>I want to lecture you.</t4036> <t4037>I want your life to make the world respect you.</t4037> <t4038>To have a spotless name and a reputation above all suspicion.</t4038> <t4039>To rid yourself of those terrible people you associate with.</t4039> <t4040>Don't shrug your shoulders once more.</t4040> <t4041>Don't show such indifference.</t4041> <t4042>You have a lot of influence.</t4042> <t4043>Let it be for good, not for evil.</t4043> <t4044>They say you corrupt everyone you become intimate with, and that when you enter a house, shame of one kind or another follows closely behind you.</t4044> <t4045>I don't know if it's true or not.</t4045> <t4046>How could I know?</t4046> <t4047>But that is what they say about you.</t4047> <t4048>I've been told things that seem impossible to doubt.</t4048> <t4049>Lord Gloucester was one of my best friends at Oxford.</t4049> <t4050>He showed me a letter his wife wrote to him when she was dying, alone, in her villa in Mentone.</t4050> <t4051>Your name appeared in it, mixed with the most terrible confession I have ever read.</t4051> <t4052>I told him it was absurd; that I knew you perfectly, and that you were incapable of anything like that.</t4052> <t4053>Do I know you?</t4053> <t4054>I wonder if it's true that I know you.</t4054> <t4055>Before answering, I would have to see your soul.</t4055>
<t4056>—See my soul! —murmured Dorian Gray, rising from the sofa and paling with fear.</t4056>
<t4057>—Yes —replied Hallward with great seriousness and a deeply sorrowful tone—; to see your soul.</t4057> <t4058>But only God can do that.</t4058>
<t4059>A bitter mocking laugh escaped from the lips of his interlocutor.</t4059>
<t4060>—You will have the chance to see it tonight! —he exclaimed, taking a lamp from the table—.</t4060> <t4061>Come: it is your work.</t4061> <t4062>Why should I hide it from you?</t4062> <t4063>Later you can tell the world, if you decide to do so.</t4063> <t4064>Nobody will believe you.</t4064> <t4065>If they truly believed you, they would hold me in even higher regard.</t4065> <t4066>I know the times we live in better than you, even though you drone on about them as tediously as you do.</t4066> <t4067>Come, I tell you.</t4067> <t4068>You have talked enough about corruption.</t4068> <t4069>Now you will have the chance to see it face to face.</t4069>
<t4070>The madness of pride was present in every word.</t4070> <t4071>Dorian Gray struck the ground with the insolence of a child.</t4071> <t4072>The idea that someone might share his secret filled him with a dreadful joy, especially that the man who had painted the portrait, which was the source of all his shame, would carry for the rest of his life the horrible memory of what he had done.</t4072>
<t4073>—Yes —he continued, getting closer to him, and staring unblinkingly into his friend's stern eyes—.</t4073> <t4074>I'm going to show you my soul.</t4074> <t4075>I'm going to show you that thing which, according to you, only God can see.</t4075>
<t4076>Hallward instinctively stepped back.</t4076>
<t4077>—That is blasphemy, Dorian! —he exclaimed—.</t4077> <t4078>You must not say such things.</t4078> <t4079>They are horrible, and they mean nothing.</t4079> <t4080>—Is that what you think? —replied Dorian Gray, laughing again.</t4080>
<t4081>—I know.</t4081> <t4082>As for what I told you tonight, I did it for your own good.</t4082> <t4083>You know that I have always been a loyal friend.</t4083>
<t4084>—Don't touch me.</t4084> <t4085>Finish what you have to say.</t4085>
<t4086>The pain contorted the painter's features for an instant.</t4086> <t4087>He remained silent, overwhelmed by a feeling of infinite compassion.</t4087> <t4088>After all, what right did he have to interfere in Dorian's life?</t4088> <t4089>Even if he had done only a tenth of what was said about him, how much he must have suffered!</t4089> <t4090>But he immediately straightened up, heading towards the fireplace, and there he stayed, gazing at the logs, which burned with ashes resembling frost and throbbing hearts made of flames.</t4090>
<t4091>—I am waiting, Basil —said the young man, with a clear and hard voice.</t4091>
<t4092>The painter turned around.</t4092>
<t4093>—What I have to say is this —he exclaimed—.</t4093> <t4094>You must give me some answer to the terrible accusations made against you.</t4094> <t4095>If you tell me that they are absolutely false from beginning to end, I will believe you.</t4095> <t4096>Deny them, Dorian, do me the favor of denying them!</t4096> <t4097>Don't you see how much I am suffering?</t4097> <t4098>Good heavens!</t4098> <t4099>Don't tell me that you are a wicked, corrupt, infamous person.</t4099>
<t4100>Dorian Gray smiled.</t4100> <t4101>A gesture of disdain curved his lips.</t4101>
<t4102>—Come upstairs with me, Basil —he said calmly—.</t4102> <t4103>I keep a diary of my life that never leaves the room where it is written.</t4103> <t4104>I will show it to you if you accompany me.</t4104>
<t4105>—I will go up with you, Dorian, if you wish.</t4105> <t4106>I see that I have already missed the train.</t4106> <t4107>It doesn't matter.</t4107> <t4108>I will leave tomorrow.</t4108> <t4109>But don't ask me to read anything tonight.</t4109> <t4110>All I want is a direct answer to my question.</t4110>
<t4111>—It will be given to you on the top floor.</t4111> <t4112>I can't give it to you here.</t4112> <t4113>It won't be necessary for you to read for long.</t4113>
<t4114>Chapter 13</t4114>
<t4115>Dorian left the room and began to ascend, closely followed by Basil Hallward.</t4115> <t4116>They walked without making noise, as one instinctively does at night.</t4116> <t4117>The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and the staircase.</t4117> <t4118>The wind, which was beginning to rise, made some windows rattle.</t4118>
<t4119>When they reached the attic landing, Dorian placed the lamp on the floor and, taking out the key, inserted it into the lock.</t4119>
<t4120>—Do you really want to know, Basil? —he asked in a low voice.</t4120>
<t4121>—Yes.</t4121>
<t4122>—You can't imagine how glad I am —he replied, smiling.</t4122> <t4123>Then he added, with a certain violence—: you are the only person in the world who has the right to know everything about me.</t4123> <t4124>You are more closely tied to my life than you think —then, picking up the lamp, he opened the door and entered the old playroom.</t4124> <t4125>A cold draft assaulted them, and the lamp emitted for a few moments a flame of murky orange color.</t4125> <t4126>Dorian Gray shivered—.</t4126> <t4127>Close the door —he whispered to Basil, while placing the lamp on the table.</t4127>
<t4128>Hallward looked around, bewildered.</t4128> <t4129>It seemed as if that room had not been used for years.</t4129> <t4130>A faded Flemish tapestry, a painting behind a curtain, an old Italian cassone, and an almost empty bookshelf were all it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a table.</t4130> <t4131>While Dorian Gray lit a half-burned candle that rested on the mantelpiece, Basil noticed that everything was covered in dust and that the carpet had many holes.</t4131> <t4132>A mouse ran to hide behind the wooden paneling.</t4132> <t4133>The entire room smelled of mold and dampness.</t4133>
<t4134>—So, according to you, only God sees the soul, isn't that right?</t4134> <t4135>Draw back the curtain and you will see mine.</t4135>
<t4136>The voice that spoke was cold and cruel.</t4136>
<t4137>—You are crazy, Dorian, or you are playing a role —murmured Hallward, frowning.</t4137>
<t4138>—Don't you dare?</t4138> <t4139>In that case, I'll do it —said the young man, tearing the curtain from the bar that held it and throwing it to the ground.</t4139>
<t4140>A cry of horror escaped the painter's lips upon seeing, in the dim light, the ghastly face that smiled at him from the canvas.</t4140> <t4141>There was something in its expression that immediately filled him with disgust and loathing.</t4141> <t4142>Good heavens!</t4142> <t4143>It was the face of Dorian Gray that he was seeing!</t4143> <t4144>The mysterious abomination had not yet completely destroyed its extraordinary beauty.</t4144> <t4145>There were still traces of gold in the lightening hair and a hint of color in the sensual mouth.</t4145> <t4146>The swollen eyes retained some of the purity of their blue, the noble curves had not entirely vanished from the chiseled nose nor from the well-shaped neck.</t4146> <t4147>Yes, it was Dorian.</t4147> <t4148>But who had done it?</t4148> <t4149>He seemed to recognize his own brushstrokes, and as for the frame, the design was also his.</t4149> <t4150>The idea was monstrous, but nonetheless, he felt afraid.</t4150> <t4151>Seizing the lit candle, he approached the painting.</t4151> <t4152>Below, on the left, he found his name, inscribed in long letters of bright vermilion.</t4152>
<t4153>It was a repugnant parody, an infamous and ignoble caricature.</t4153> <t4154>That canvas was not his work.</t4154> <t4155>And yet, it was his portrait.</t4155> <t4156>There was no doubt about it, and he felt as if, in a moment, the blood running through his veins had gone from fire to inert ice.</t4156> <t4157>His painting! What did it mean?</t4157> <t4158>Why had it changed?</t4158> <t4159>Turning around, he looked at Dorian Gray with sick eyes.</t4159> <t4160>His mouth contracted and his tongue, completely dry, was unable to articulate the slightest sound.</t4160> <t4161>He wiped his forehead with his hand, collecting a sticky sweat.</t4161>
<t4162>His young friend, leaning against the mantelpiece, watched him with the strange expression one sees on those who are absorbed in a theatrical performance when a great actor is performing.</t4162> <t4163>It was neither of true sorrow nor of true joy.</t4163> <t4164>It was simply the passion of the spectator, perhaps with a fleeting glimmer of triumph in his eyes.</t4164> <t4165>Dorian Gray had removed the flower he wore in his buttonhole and was smelling it or pretending to smell it.</t4165>
<t4166>—What does this mean? —exclaimed Hallward, finally.</t4166> <t4167>His own voice sounded discordant and strange to him.</t4167>
<t4168>—Years ago, when I was nothing more than a teenager —said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower with his hand—, you met me, flattered my vanity, and taught me to take pride in my beauty.</t4168> <t4169>One day you introduced me to one of your friends, who explained the wonder of youth to me, while you finished the portrait that revealed to me the miracle of beauty.</t4169> <t4170>In a moment of madness, of which even now I still do not know if I regret or not, I made a wish, although perhaps you would call it a prayer...</t4170>
<t4171>—I remember!</t4171> <t4172>Yes, I remember it perfectly!</t4172> <t4173>No!</t4173> <t4174>That is impossible.</t4174> <t4175>This room is full of humidity.</t4175> <t4176>The mold has attacked the canvas.</t4176> <t4177>The colors I used contained some unfortunate mineral poison.</t4177> <t4178>I assure you it is impossible.</t4178>
<t4179>—What is impossible? —murmured Dorian, approaching the balcony and resting his forehead against the cold glass fogged by the mist.</t4179>
<t4180>—You told me that you had destroyed it.</t4180>
<t4181>—I was wrong.</t4181> <t4182>The portrait has destroyed me.</t4182>
<t4183>—I don't think it's my painting.</t4183>
<t4184>—Don't you see your ideal in him?</t4184> <t4185>—asked Dorian bitterly.</t4185>
<t4186>—My ideal, as you call it...</t4186>
<t4187>—As you called it.</t4187>
<t4188>—There was no malice in him, he had nothing to be ashamed of.</t4188> <t4189>You were for me the ideal that I will never find again.</t4189> <t4190>And that is the face of a satyr.</t4190>
<t4191>—It is the face of my soul.</t4191>
<t4192>—Heavens above!</t4192> <t4193>What a creature I chose to adore!</t4193> <t4194>It has the eyes of a demon.</t4194>
<t4195>—We all carry heaven and hell within us, Basil —exclaimed Dorian with an excessive gesture of despair.</t4195> <t4196>Hallward turned again towards the portrait and stared at it intently.</t4196>
<t4197>—My God!</t4197> <t4198>If it's true —he exclaimed—, and this is what you've done with your life, you are even worse than those who attack you imagine! —he brought the candle closer to the canvas again to examine it.</t4198> <t4199>The surface seemed to remain exactly as he had left it.</t4199> <t4200>The corruption and horror appeared to emerge from the depths of the painting.</t4200> <t4201>The inner life of the portrayed person manifested mysteriously, and the leprosy of sin slowly devoured the painting.</t4201> <t4202>The decomposition of a corpse in a damp grave would not be such a dreadful sight.</t4202>
<t4203>His hand trembled; the candle fell from the candlestick to the floor and began to sputter.</t4203> <t4204>Hallward extinguished it with his foot.</t4204> <t4205>Then he let himself fall into the rickety chair near the table and hid his face in his hands.</t4205>
<t4206>—Good heavens, Dorian, what a lesson!</t4206> <t4207>What a terrible lesson! —he received no response, but he heard his friend sobbing by the window—.</t4207> <t4208>Pray, Dorian, pray —he murmured—.</t4208> <t4209>What was it that they taught us to say when we were children?</t4209> <t4210>“Lead us not into temptation.</t4210> <t4211>Forgive us our sins.</t4211> <t4212>Blot out our iniquities.”</t4212> <t4213>Let's repeat it together.</t4213> <t4214>Your prayer of pride was answered.</t4214> <t4215>Your prayer of repentance will also be heard.</t4215> <t4216>I admired you too much.</t4216> <t4217>We have both been punished.</t4217>
<t4218>Dorian Gray slowly turned, looking at him with eyes clouded by tears.</t4218>
<t4219>—It's too late -he stammered.</t4219>
<t4220>—It is never too late.</t4220> <t4221>Let us kneel and try together to remember a prayer.</t4221> <t4222>Isn't there a verse that says: "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow[13]"?</t4222>
<t4223>—Those words mean nothing to me anymore.</t4223>
<t4224>—Quiet!</t4224> <t4225>Don't say that.</t4225> <t4226>You have already done enough evil in your life.</t4226> <t4227>Good heavens! Don't you see how that hateful creature is laughing at us?</t4227>
<t4228>Dorian Gray glanced at the picture and, suddenly, an uncontrollable hatred towards Basil Hallward seized him, as if it had been suggested by the image on the canvas, as if those mocking lips had whispered it into his ear.</t4228> <t4229>The wild passions of a cornered animal ignited within him, and he hated the man sitting at the table more than he had ever hated anything or anyone in his entire life.</t4229> <t4230>He cast frantic glances around.</t4230> <t4231>Something gleamed on top of the painted dresser in front of him.</t4231> <t4232>His eyes fixed on that object.</t4232> <t4233>He knew what it was.</t4233> <t4234>It was a knife he had brought a few days earlier to cut a piece of rope and then had forgotten to take away.</t4234> <t4235>He moved slowly in its direction, passing by Hallward.</t4235> <t4236>When he was behind him, he grasped it and turned around.</t4236> <t4237>Hallward shifted in his chair, as if preparing to stand up.</t4237> <t4238>Throwing himself upon him, he plunged the knife into the large vein behind his ear, banging his head against the table, and then stabbing him repeatedly.</t4238>
<t4239>Only a muffled groan was heard, and the horrible sound of someone choking on their own blood.</t4239> <t4240>Three times the outstretched arms rose, convulsing, shaking grotesque hands with rigid fingers in the air.</t4240> <t4241>Dorian Gray stabbed the knife twice more, but Basil did not move.</t4241> <t4242>Something began to drip onto the floor.</t4242> <t4243>Dorian Gray waited a moment, still pressing the head against the table.</t4243> <t4244>Then he dropped the weapon and listened.</t4244>
<t4245>Only the sound of blood drops hitting the worn-out carpet could be heard.</t4245> <t4246>He opened the door and stepped out onto the landing.</t4246> <t4247>The house was in absolute silence.</t4247> <t4248>No one had gotten up.</t4248> <t4249>For a few seconds, he remained leaning over the railing, trying to pierce the black well of tormented darkness with his gaze.</t4249> <t4250>Then he took the key out of his pocket and returned to the portrait room, locking himself inside.</t4250>
<t4251>The body remained seated in the chair, partly slumped over the table, head tilted, back bent, and arms hanging down, strangely long.</t4251> <t4252>If it weren't for the irregular red gash on the neck, and the dark, almost coagulated pool slowly spreading over the table, one might have thought that the reclining figure was merely sleeping.</t4252>
<t4253>How quickly everything had happened!</t4253> <t4254>He felt a strange calmness and, approaching the balcony, opened it to step outside.</t4254> <t4255>The wind had carried away the fog, and the sky was like the wheel of a monstrous peacock, studded with countless golden eyes.</t4255> <t4256>Looking down at the street, he saw the neighborhood policeman making his rounds and directing the long beam of his dim flashlight towards the doors of silent houses.</t4256> <t4257>The crimson stain of a cab glowed at the corner only to disappear a moment later.</t4257> <t4258>A woman with a shawl fluttering in the wind was advancing slowly, with an unsteady step, leaning on the garden railings.</t4258> <t4259>From time to time she would stop and look back.</t4259> <t4260>On one occasion she began to sing in a hoarse voice.</t4260> <t4261>The policeman approached her and said something to her.</t4261> <t4262>The woman staggered away, laughing.</t4262> <t4263>A very cold gust of wind swept through the square.</t4263> <t4264>The gas lights flickered, turning blue, and the bare trees shook their black iron branches.</t4264> <t4265>Dorian Gray shivered and returned to the room, closing the balcony.</t4265>
<t4266>Upon reaching the door, he turned the key and opened it.</t4266> <t4267>He didn't even turn around to glance at the corpse.</t4267> <t4268>He understood that the secret of success was to not acknowledge what had happened.</t4268> <t4269>The friend who had painted the fateful portrait, the cause of all his suffering, had disappeared from his life.</t4269> <t4270>That was enough.</t4270>
<t4271>It was then that he remembered the lamp.</t4271> <t4272>It was a rather curious example of Muslim craftsmanship, wrought in matte silver with inlays of burnished steel arabesques, studded with unpolished turquoise.</t4272> <t4273>Perhaps his servant would miss it and ask questions.</t4273> <t4274>He hesitated for a moment, but eventually went back in and retrieved it.</t4274> <t4275>This time he couldn't help but see the corpse.</t4275> <t4276>How still it was!</t4276> <t4277>How horribly white and long its hands seemed!</t4277> <t4278>It was like a ghastly wax figure.</t4278>
<t4279>After locking the door again, Dorian Gray silently descended the staircase.</t4279> <t4280>The creaking of some steps seemed like cries of pain to him.</t4280> <t4281>He stopped several times and waited.</t4281> <t4282>No: everything was silent.</t4282> <t4283>It was just the sound of his footsteps.</t4283>
<t4284>Upon arriving at the library, he saw the coat, cap, and briefcase in a corner.</t4284> <t4285>They needed to be hidden somewhere.</t4285> <t4286>He opened a secret wardrobe, concealed in the wood paneling, where he hid his curious costumes, and left them there.</t4286> <t4287>He could burn them without any problems later.</t4287> <t4288>Then he took out the watch.</t4288> <t4289>It was twenty to two.</t4289>
<t4290>He sat down and began to think.</t4290> <t4291>Every year —almost every month— someone was hanged in England for a crime similar to the one he had just committed.</t4291> <t4292>It seemed as if a murderous madness had arisen in the air.</t4292> <t4293>Some red star had come too close to the Earth...</t4293> <t4294>But then, what evidence was there against him?</t4294> <t4295>Basil Hallward left the house at eleven.</t4295> <t4296>No one had seen him re-enter.</t4296> <t4297>Most of the servants were at Selby Royal.</t4297> <t4298>His valet had gone to bed... Paris! Yes.</t4298> <t4299>Basil had gone to Paris on the midnight train, just as he had planned to do.</t4299> <t4300>Given the curious reserve that characterized him, it would be months before the first suspicions arose.</t4300> <t4301>Months!</t4301> <t4302>Everything could be destroyed long before that.</t4302>
<t4303>An idea suddenly crossed his mind.</t4303> <t4304>He put on his fur coat and hat and went out to the hallway.</t4304> <t4305>Then he stopped, hearing the slow, heavy steps of the policeman on the sidewalk and seeing the reflection of the dim lantern in the window.</t4305> <t4306>He waited, holding his breath.</t4306>
<t4307>After a few moments, he slid back the bolt and slipped out stealthily, closing the door very gently behind him.</t4307> <t4308>Then he began to ring the front doorbell.</t4308> <t4309>About five minutes later, his valet appeared, half-dressed and looking sleepy.</t4309>
<t4310>—I am sorry to have had to wake you, Francis —said Dorian Gray, entering the house—, but I forgot the keys.</t4310> <t4311>What time is it?</t4311>
<t4312>—Two ten —replied the servant, looking at the clock and blinking.</t4312>
<t4313>—Two ten?</t4313> <t4314>Horribly late!</t4314> <t4315>Wake me up tomorrow at nine.</t4315> <t4316>I have to do an urgent job.</t4316>
<t4317>—Yes, sir.</t4317>
<t4318>—Has any visitor come this afternoon?</t4318>
<t4319>—Mr. Hallward.</t4319> <t4320>He was here until eleven, and then he left to catch the train.</t4320>
<t4321>—Ah! I'm sorry I missed him.</t4321> <t4322>Did he leave any message?</t4322> <t4323>—No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris if he didn't find you at the club.</t4323>
<t4324>—Nothing else, Francis.</t4324> <t4325>Don't forget to call me tomorrow at nine.</t4325>
<t4326>—Yes, sir.</t4326>
<t4327>The servant walked away down the corridor, slightly dragging his slippers.</t4327>
<t4328>Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat onto the table and entered the library.</t4328> <t4329>For a quarter of an hour, he paced, biting his lips and thinking.</t4329> <t4330>Then he took a directory from one of the shelves and began to flip through the pages.</t4330> <t4331>“Alan Campbell, 152 Hertford Street, Mayfair.”</t4331> <t4332>Yes; he was the man he needed.</t4332>
<t4333>Chapter 14</t4333>
<t4334>At nine o'clock in the morning the next day, the servant entered with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.</t4334> <t4335>Dorian was sleeping peacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand under his cheek.</t4335> <t4336>He looked like a teenager exhausted from play or study.</t4336>
<t4337>The valet had to tap him twice on the shoulder to wake him, and as he opened his eyes, the shadow of a smile crossed his lips, as if he had been lost in some pleasant dream.</t4337> <t4338>In reality, he had not dreamed at all.</t4338> <t4339>No image, neither pleasant nor painful, had disturbed his rest.</t4339> <t4340>But youth smiles without reason.</t4340> <t4341>It is one of its greatest charms.</t4341>
<t4342>Turning around, Dorian Gray began to sip the chocolate, leaning on his elbow.</t4342> <t4343>The sweet November sun poured into the room.</t4343> <t4344>The sky was radiant, and there was a comforting warmth in the air.</t4344> <t4345>It was almost like a May morning.</t4345>
<t4346>Little by little, the events of the previous night penetrated his brain, advancing stealthily with blood-stained feet, until they regained their shape with terrible clarity.</t4346> <t4347>A grimace of pain appeared on his face as he remembered all he had suffered and, for a moment, the strange feeling of hatred that had compelled him to kill Basil Hallward took hold of him again, filling him with an icy rage.</t4347> <t4348>The dead man was undoubtedly still sitting in the chair, now illuminated by the sun.</t4348> <t4349>What a horrible image!</t4349> <t4350>Such dreadful things were meant for the darkness of night, not for the light of day.</t4350>
<t4351>He felt that if he meditated on what had happened to him, he risked falling ill or going mad.</t4351> <t4352>There were sins whose fascination lay more in memory than in their actual commission; strange triumphs more gratifying to pride than to passions, and which gave the intellect a livelier feeling of joy, superior to the pleasure that they procure or could ever procure for the senses.</t4352> <t4353>But this last one did not belong to that category.</t4353> <t4354>It was something that needed to be expelled from the mind, lulled with opium, strangled before it could strangle you.</t4354>
<t4355>When the clock struck half past, Dorian Gray ran his hand over his forehead, stood up decisively, and dressed with even more care than usual, paying great attention to the choice of tie and pin, and changing his rings more than once.</t4355> <t4356>He also spent a lot of time on breakfast, trying the different dishes, talking with his valet about the new liveries he was thinking of ordering for the servants at Selby, and going through his correspondence.</t4356> <t4357>Some of the letters made him smile.</t4357> <t4358>Three bored him.</t4358> <t4359>One he read several times and then tore up with a slight gesture of irritation on his face.</t4359> <t4360>"What a calamity, a woman's memories!" as Lord Henry had said on one occasion.</t4360>
<t4361>After drinking the cup of black coffee, he slowly wiped his lips with the napkin, gestured to his servant to wait, and, heading towards his desk, sat down and wrote two letters.</t4361> <t4362>He put one in his pocket and handed the other to the servant.</t4362>
<t4363>—Take her to 152 Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell has left London, ask for his address.</t4363>
<t4364>When he was left alone, he lit a cigarette and began to draw on a piece of paper: first flowers, then architectural details, and finally, faces.</t4364> <t4365>Suddenly, he noticed that all the faces he drew seemed to have a strange resemblance to Basil Hallward.</t4365> <t4366>He frowned and, standing up, walked over to a shelf and took a volume at random.</t4366> <t4367>He was determined not to think about what had happened until it was absolutely necessary to do so.</t4367>
<t4368>After lying down on the sofa, he looked at the title of the book.</t4368> <t4369>It was Émaux et Camées[14], the Charpentier edition on Japan paper, with an engraving by Jacquemart[15].</t4369> <t4370>The binding was of lime green leather, with a gold lattice, sprinkled with pomegranates.</t4370> <t4371>It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton.</t4371> <t4372>As he turned the pages, his eyes stopped at a poem about Lacenaire's[16] hand, the icy yellowish hand «du supplice encore mal lavée», with its red hair and its «doigts de faune».</t4372> <t4373>Dorian Gray looked at his own fingers, white as wax, shuddered involuntarily, and moved on until he reached the splendid stanzas dedicated to Venice:</t4373>
<t4374>On a chromatic scale,</t4374>
<t4375>The breast glistening with pearls,</t4375>
<t4376>The Venus of the Adriatic</t4376>
<t4377>Emerges from the water, her body pink and white.</t4377>
<t4378>The domes, on the azure of the waves</t4378>
<t4379>Following the sentence with a pure outline,</t4379>
<t4380>Swell like round throats</t4380>
<t4381>That raises a sigh of love.</t4381>
<t4382>The skiff approaches and drops me off</t4382>
<t4383>Throwing his anchor at the pilferer,</t4383>
<t4384>In front of a pink facade,</t4384>
<t4385>On the marble of a staircase.</t4385>
<t4386>What exquisite verses!</t4386> <t4387>Reading them gave the impression of floating through the green canals of the city of pink and pearl gray, sitting in a black gondola with a silver prow and some veils dragged by the breeze.</t4387> <t4388>The verses themselves seemed like the straight turquoise blue wakes that follow the visitor when sailing towards the Lido.</t4388> <t4389>The sudden bursts of color reminded him of the flashes of the pigeons —the opal and iris-colored throats— that flutter around the slender beehive-shaped campanile, or that stroll, with quiet elegance, among the dusty arches in the shadows.</t4389> <t4390>Leaning back, with his eyes half-closed, Dorian repeated the verses over and over again:</t4390>
<t4391>“In front of a pink facade,</t4391>
<t4392>On the marble of a staircase.</t4392>
<t4393>All of Venice was contained there.</t4393> <t4394>He remembered the autumn he had spent in the city, and the wonderful love that drove him to wild and delightful madness.</t4394> <t4395>There was poetry everywhere.</t4395> <t4396>Because Venice, like Oxford, preserved the proper poetic atmosphere and, for the true romantic, the atmosphere was everything, or almost everything.</t4396> <t4397>Basil spent some time with him during that stay, and he had become enthusiastic about Tintoretto.</t4397> <t4398>Poor Basil! What a horrible death he had!</t4398>
<t4399>Dorian Gray sighed, opened Gautier's book again, and tried to forget.</t4399> <t4400>He read the verses dedicated to the little café in Smyrna where the hajis pass their amber beads, and the turbaned merchants smoke their long pipes adorned with tassels, while they converse about profound topics as the swallows dart in and out making quick turns; he read about the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that sheds granite tears in its lonely sunless exile and longs to return to the burning Nile covered with lotus flowers, where there are sphinxes and pink ibises and white vultures with golden claws and crocodiles with beryl eyes that crawl through the steaming green mud; and he began to dream with the stanzas that, drawing music from the marble stained with kisses, speak of the curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the "monstre charmant" lying in the Louvre in the hall of porphyries.</t4400> <t4401>But after some time the book fell from his hands.</t4401> <t4402>Nervousness began to dominate him, culminating in a tremendous attack of terror.</t4402> <t4403>What would happen if Alan Campbell was not in England?</t4403> <t4404>Days and days would have to pass before he returned.</t4404> <t4405>Perhaps he would refuse to come back.</t4405> <t4406>What to do then?</t4406> <t4407>Every minute counted; it was of vital importance.</t4407> <t4408>They had been great friends once, five years ago; almost inseparable, to tell the truth.</t4408> <t4409>Then their intimacy ended abruptly.</t4409> <t4410>When they met in public, it was Dorian Gray who smiled, never Alan Campbell.</t4410>
<t4411>He was an extraordinarily intelligent young man, although without a true appreciation for the visual arts, and if he had come to grasp the beauty of poetry at all, he owed it entirely to Dorian.</t4411> <t4412>His dominant intellectual passion was science.</t4412> <t4413>At Cambridge, he spent a large part of his time working in the laboratory, and he had obtained a good grade in the final natural sciences exam.</t4413> <t4414>In fact, he was still dedicated to the study of chemistry, and he had his own laboratory, where he would often lock himself up all day, much to the irritation of his mother, who tended to confuse chemists with apothecaries, and who was especially hopeful that he would secure a seat in Parliament.</t4414> <t4415>Campbell was, on the other hand, an excellent musician, and he played the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.</t4415> <t4416>Music had, in fact, been the bond between Dorian Gray and him: music and the indefinable charm that Dorian could use at will and often did use without being aware of it.</t4416> <t4417>They had met at Lady Berkshire's house the night Rubinstein played there, and afterward, they were frequently seen together at the opera and wherever good music was performed.</t4417> <t4418>Their intimacy had lasted eighteen months.</t4418> <t4419>Campbell was always at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square.</t4419> <t4420>For him, as for many others, Dorian Gray represented the model of everything wonderful and fascinating in life.</t4420>
<t4421>Nobody knew if they had ended up fighting.</t4421> <t4422>But, suddenly, other people noticed that they barely spoke when they saw each other, and that Campbell would soon leave the parties that Dorian Gray attended.</t4422> <t4423>He had changed, moreover: he sometimes appeared strangely melancholic, almost as if music displeased him, and he never played, giving as an excuse, when asked to perform something, that he was so absorbed in science that he lacked time to practice.</t4423> <t4424>And it was undoubtedly true.</t4424> <t4425>With each passing day, he seemed more interested in biology, and his name had appeared once or twice in some scientific journals, in relation to certain curious experiments.</t4425>
<t4426>Such was the man that Dorian Gray was waiting for.</t4426> <t4427>His gaze turned towards the clock every moment.</t4427> <t4428>As the minutes passed, his agitation increased.</t4428> <t4429>Finally, he got up and began to pace around the room, with the appearance of a beautiful caged animal.</t4429> <t4430>He walked with long strides that had something furtive about them.</t4430> <t4431>And his hands had become strangely cold.</t4431>
<t4432>The uncertainty became unbearable.</t4432> <t4433>He had the impression that time was dragging its feet, while he, pushed by monstrous hurricanes, advanced towards the jagged edge of a black precipice.</t4433> <t4434>Dorian knew what awaited him down there; he even saw it, and, trembling, he pressed his burning eyelids with damp hands as if he wanted to steal the sight from his very brain, pushing his eyeballs deep into their sockets.</t4434> <t4435>But it was useless.</t4435> <t4436>The brain had its own sustenance, on which it fed, and the imagination, driven to grotesque excesses by terror, writhed and deformed like a living being in pain, danced like a horrible puppet on a stage, and grimaced behind animated masks.</t4436> <t4437>Then, suddenly, Time stopped for him.</t4437> <t4438>Yes; that blind dimension, with its slow breathing, ceased to drag on, and horrible thoughts, since Time had died, began a rapid race and unearthed the dreadful future from its grave to show it to him.</t4438> <t4439>Dorian stared at it fixedly.</t4439> <t4440>And the horror he felt left him petrified.</t4440>
<t4441>Finally, the door opened, giving way to the valet.</t4441> <t4442>Dorian Gray looked at him with glassy eyes.</t4442>
<t4443>—Mr. Campbell —he announced.</t4443>
<t4444>A sigh of relief then escaped from the parched lips of Dorian Gray, and color returned to his cheeks.</t4444>
<t4445>—Have him come in right now, Francis —he felt like his old self again.</t4445> <t4446>He had overcome the moment of cowardice.</t4446>
<t4447>The servant bowed his head and withdrew.</t4447> <t4448>Moments later, Alan Campbell entered, looking severe and quite pale, the pallor intensified by his jet-black hair and eyebrows.</t4448>
<t4449>—Atan! How kind of you!</t4449> <t4450>Thank you so much for coming.</t4450>
<t4451>—I had resolved not to set foot in your house again, Gray.</t4451> <t4452>But I was told it was a matter of life and death —his voice was hard and cold, and he spoke with studied slowness.</t4452> <t4453>There was an expression of contempt in the insistent gaze with which he proceeded to study Dorian's face.</t4453> <t4454>He kept his hands in the pockets of his astrakhan coat and gave the impression of not having noticed the gesture with which he had been received.</t4454>
<t4455>—Yes; it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and for more than one person.</t4455> <t4456>Please sit down.</t4456>
<t4457>Campbell occupied a chair next to the table, and Dorian sat across from him.</t4457> <t4458>The two men looked into each other's eyes.</t4458> <t4459>In Dorian's eyes, there was infinite compassion.</t4459> <t4460>He knew that what he was about to do was dreadful.</t4460>
<t4461>After a tense moment of silence, he leaned forward and said, very calmly, but attentive to the effect of each word on the face of his visitor:</t4461>
<t4462>—Alan, in a locked room in the attic of this house, in a room that no one, except myself, has access to, there is a dead man sitting at a table.</t4462> <t4463>He has been dead for ten hours now.</t4463> <t4464>Do not move, nor look at me that way.</t4464> <t4465>Who that person is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern you.</t4465> <t4466>What you have to do is this...</t4466>
<t4467>—Enough, Gray.</t4467> <t4468>I don't want to know anything more.</t4468> <t4469>I don't know if what you just told me is a lie or the truth.</t4469> <t4470>I don't care.</t4470> <t4471>I completely refuse to get involved in your life.</t4471> <t4472>Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.</t4472> <t4473>They no longer interest me.</t4473>
<t4474>—They have to interest you, Alan.</t4474> <t4475>This one, in particular, is going to have to interest you.</t4475> <t4476>I'm very sorry for you, but I can't help it.</t4476> <t4477>You are the only person who can save me.</t4477> <t4478>I am forced to compel your intervention.</t4478> <t4479>I have no alternative.</t4479> <t4480>You are a man of science, Alan.</t4480> <t4481>You know chemistry and other related things.</t4481> <t4482>You have conducted experiments.</t4482> <t4483>The matter at hand is for you to destroy the lifeless body that is up there; to destroy it in such a way that not the slightest trace remains.</t4483> <t4484>No one saw that person enter this house.</t4484> <t4485>It is believed, in fact, that they are currently in Paris.</t4485> <t4486>Months will pass before they are missed.</t4486> <t4487>When that happens, it is essential that no trace of them remains here.</t4487> <t4488>You, Alan, must take charge of turning them, and all their belongings, into a handful of ashes that can be scattered to the wind.</t4488>
<t4489>—You are crazy, Dorian.</t4489>
<t4490>—Ah! I was eagerly waiting for you to call me, Dorian.</t4490> <t4491>—You are crazy, I repeat...</t4491> <t4492>Crazy to imagine that I would lift a finger to help you, crazy to make that monstrous confession.</t4492> <t4493>I don't want to have anything to do with that matter, whatever it is.</t4493> <t4494>Do you think I'm willing to put my reputation at risk for you?</t4494> <t4495>What do I care about what diabolical task you've gotten yourself into?</t4495>
<t4496>—This is a suicide, Alan.</t4496>
<t4497>—I'm glad to hear that.</t4497> <t4498>But, who pushed him to suicide?</t4498> <t4499>I'm sure it was you.</t4499>
<t4500>—Are you still refusing to do what I ask?</t4500>
<t4501>—Of course, I refuse.</t4501> <t4502>I don't want to have anything to do with it.</t4502> <t4503>I don't care what it brings you.</t4503> <t4504>You deserve everything that happens to you.</t4504> <t4505>It won't sadden me to see you dishonored, publicly dishonored.</t4505> <t4506>How dare you ask me, especially me, to take part in that horror?</t4506> <t4507>I would have thought you understood people's nature better.</t4507> <t4508>Maybe your friend Lord Henry Wotton hasn't taught you much about psychology, even though he has taught you a lot about other things.</t4508> <t4509>Nothing will make me take a step to help you.</t4509> <t4510>You have chosen the wrong person.</t4510> <t4511>Go to one of your friends.</t4511> <t4512>Not to me.</t4512>
<t4513>—It has been a murder, Alan.</t4513> <t4514>I have killed him.</t4514> <t4515>You don't know how much he made me suffer.</t4515> <t4516>Think what you will of my life, he has contributed more to ruining it than poor Harry.</t4516> <t4517>Perhaps it wasn't his intention, but the result has been the same.</t4517>
<t4518>—Murder! Good heavens, Dorian!</t4518> <t4519>Is that what you've come to at last?</t4519> <t4520>I won't turn you in.</t4520> <t4521>It's none of my business.</t4521> <t4522>Besides, without me lifting a finger, they'll end up catching you.</t4522> <t4523>No one ever commits a crime without doing something stupid.</t4523> <t4524>But I refuse to get involved.</t4524>
<t4525>—You will have to do it.</t4525> <t4526>Wait, wait a moment; listen to me.</t4526> <t4527>You just have to hear me out.</t4527> <t4528>All I ask is that you carry out a certain scientific experiment.</t4528> <t4529>You go to hospitals and morgues, and the horrors you see there do not affect you.</t4529> <t4530>If in a ghastly dissection room or a foul-smelling laboratory you found a human being on a lead table with red incisions made to let the blood out, you would look at it as something admirable.</t4530> <t4531>You wouldn't flinch.</t4531> <t4532>You wouldn't think you were doing anything reprehensible.</t4532> <t4533>On the contrary, you would consider that you were working for the benefit of the human race, or increasing its store of knowledge, or satisfying its intellectual curiosity, or something of the sort.</t4533> <t4534>What I want you to do is simply something you have done many times before.</t4534> <t4535>To tell the truth, destroying a corpse must be much less horrible than what you are used to doing.</t4535> <t4536>And remember that it is the only evidence against me.</t4536> <t4537>If it is discovered, I am lost; and it will undoubtedly be known, unless you help me.</t4537>
<t4538>—I have no desire whatsoever to help you.</t4538> <t4539>That is something you forget.</t4539> <t4540>The only thing this whole matter inspires in me is indifference.</t4540> <t4541>It has nothing to do with me.</t4541>
<t4542>—Alan, I beg you.</t4542> <t4543>Think about the situation I am in.</t4543> <t4544>A few moments before you arrived, the terror almost made me faint.</t4544> <t4545>Perhaps you too will know terror someday.</t4545> <t4546>No!</t4546> <t4547>Don't think about that.</t4547> <t4548>Look at it from a strictly scientific perspective.</t4548> <t4549>You don't ask where the corpses you experiment on come from.</t4549> <t4550>Nor is it necessary for you to investigate it now.</t4550> <t4551>I've already told you too much.</t4551> <t4552>But I beg you to do it.</t4552> <t4553>We were friends once, Alan.</t4553>
<t4554>—Don't talk about that.</t4554> <t4555>Those days are dead.</t4555>
<t4556>—Sometimes what is dead endures.</t4556> <t4557>The individual in the attic will not disappear.</t4557> <t4558>He is sitting at the table with his head down and his arms hanging.</t4558> <t4559>Alan, please!</t4559> <t4560>If you don't come to my aid, I am lost.</t4560> <t4561>They will hang me!</t4561> <t4562>Don't you understand?</t4562> <t4563>They will hang me for what I have done.</t4563> <t4564>—It is useless to prolong this scene.</t4564> <t4565>I categorically refuse to intervene in this matter.</t4565> <t4566>You must be crazy to ask me such a thing.</t4566>
<t4567>—Do you refuse?</t4567>
<t4568>—Yes.</t4568>
<t4569>—I beg you, Alan.</t4569>
<t4570>—It's useless.</t4570>
<t4571>The same compassionate expression appeared again in Dorian Gray's eyes.</t4571> <t4572>Then he extended his arm, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.</t4572> <t4573>He reread it twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it to the other side of the table.</t4573> <t4574>Afterwards, he got up and approached the window.</t4574>
<t4575>Campbell looked at him surprised, and then picked up the paper and opened it.</t4575> <t4576>As he read it, his face turned an ashen pallor and he had to lean back in his chair.</t4576> <t4577>A sensation of infinite nausea overcame him.</t4577> <t4578>He felt his heart beating with an empty premonition of death.</t4578>
<t4579>After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian, leaving the window, positioned himself behind him and placed a hand on his shoulder.</t4579>
<t4580>—I'm sorry for you, Alan —he murmured—, but you haven't given me another choice.</t4580> <t4581>The letter is written.</t4581> <t4582>I have it here.</t4582> <t4583>You see who it is addressed to.</t4583> <t4584>If you don't help me, I will send it.</t4584> <t4585>You know what the consequences will be.</t4585> <t4586>But you are going to help me.</t4586> <t4587>It is impossible for you to refuse.</t4587> <t4588>I have tried to avoid this for you.</t4588> <t4589>You must acknowledge it.</t4589> <t4590>You have shown yourself to be inflexible, harsh, offensive.</t4590> <t4591>You have treated me like no one has ever dared to treat me; no one who is alive, at least.</t4591> <t4592>I have endured it all.</t4592> <t4593>But now it is I who sets the conditions.</t4593>
<t4594>Campbell hid his face in his hands, his body shaken by a tremor.</t4594>
<t4595>—Yes; I am the one who sets the conditions, Alan.</t4595> <t4596>You already know what they are.</t4596> <t4597>It's about doing something very simple.</t4597> <t4598>Come on, don't despair.</t4598> <t4599>It's inevitable.</t4599> <t4600>Accept it, and do what you have to do.</t4600>
<t4601>A moan escaped from Campbell, and he began to tremble from head to toe.</t4601> <t4602>It seemed to him that the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece was dividing time into atoms of pain, each one too terrible to bear.</t4602> <t4603>He felt as if an iron ring was slowly tightening around his forehead, as if the dishonor he was being threatened with had already descended upon him.</t4603> <t4604>The hand resting on his shoulder felt like it was made of lead.</t4604>
<t4605>—Come on, Alan; you have to make up your mind now.</t4605>
<t4606>—I can't do it —he said mechanically, as if the words could alter reality.</t4606>
<t4607>—You have to do it.</t4607> <t4608>You have no choice.</t4608> <t4609>Don't insist on delaying it.</t4609>
<t4610>Campbell hesitated for a moment.</t4610>
<t4611>—Is there a fire in the attic room?</t4611> <t4612>—Yes; a gas fixture with asbestos plates.</t4612>
<t4613>—I will have to go to my house and pick up some things from the laboratory.</t4613>
<t4614>—No, Alan; you cannot leave this house.</t4614> <t4615>Write on a piece of paper what you want, and my servant will go by carriage to fetch it.</t4615> <t4616>Campbell scribbled a few lines, dried the ink, and wrote his assistant's name on an envelope.</t4616> <t4617>Dorian took the note and read it carefully.</t4617> <t4618>Then he rang the bell and handed the letter to his valet, instructing him to return as soon as possible with the requested items.</t4618>
<t4619>When the front door closed, Campbell was startled and, getting up from the chair, he approached the fireplace.</t4619> <t4620>He was trembling as if struck by a fever.</t4620> <t4621>For about twenty minutes, no one spoke.</t4621> <t4622>A fly buzzed loudly around the room and the ticking of the clock was like the pounding of a hammer.</t4622>
<t4623>When the chimes struck one, Campbell turned around and, upon looking at Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were filled with tears.</t4623> <t4624>There was something in the purity and refinement of that sorrowful face that seemed to enrage him.</t4624>
<t4625>—You are despicable! An absolutely repugnant being! —she murmured.</t4625>
<t4626>—Hush, Alan: you have saved my life —said Dorian Gray.</t4626> <t4627>—My life? Good heavens!</t4627> <t4628>What kind of life is that?</t4628> <t4629>You have gone from corruption to corruption and now you have crowned your exploits with a murder.</t4629> <t4630>In doing what I am about to do, what you force me to do, it is not your life that I am thinking of.</t4630>
<t4631>—Stay, Alan —murmured Dorian Gray with a sigh—, I wish you could feel for me a thousandth part of the compassion you inspire in me —he turned as he spoke and stood looking at the garden.</t4631>
<t4632>Campbell did not respond.</t4632>
<t4633>After about ten minutes, there was a knock at the door, and the servant entered with a large mahogany box full of chemical products, along with a roll of steel and platinum wire, as well as two rather strangely shaped iron tongs.</t4633>
<t4634>—Should I leave these things here? —he asked Campbell.</t4634>
<t4635>—Yes —replied Dorian—.</t4635> <t4636>And I'm very much afraid, Francis, that I have another task for you.</t4636> <t4637>What is the name of that person from Richmond who brings orchids to Selby? -Harden, sir.</t4637>
<t4638>—That's right, Harden.</t4638> <t4639>You need to go to Richmond immediately, see Harden in person and tell him to send double the orchids that were ordered, and to include as few white ones as possible.</t4639> <t4640>In fact, tell him I don't want any white ones.</t4640> <t4641>It's a very nice day, Francis, and Richmond is a very beautiful place, otherwise I wouldn't tell you to go.</t4641>
<t4642>—It is no trouble at all, sir.</t4642> <t4643>What time should I be back?</t4643>
<t4644>Dorian looked at Campbell.</t4644>
<t4645>—How long will your experiment last, Alan? —she asked in a calm, indifferent voice.</t4645> <t4646>The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give it extraordinary value.</t4646>
<t4647>Campbell frowned and bit his lips.</t4647> <t4648>—About five hours —he replied.</t4648>
<t4649>—It will be enough, then, if you are back by seven-thirty.</t4649> <t4650>Better yet, stay there: get things ready so I can get dressed.</t4650> <t4651>Take the afternoon off.</t4651> <t4652>I won't be dining at home, so I won't need you.</t4652>
<t4653>—Thank you very much, sir —said the valet, leaving the room.</t4653>
<t4654>—Well, Alan, there's no time to lose.</t4654> <t4655>This box is so heavy!</t4655> <t4656>I'll carry it for you.</t4656> <t4657>You take care of the rest —he spoke quickly and with an authoritative tone.</t4657> <t4658>Campbell felt dominated by him.</t4658> <t4659>Together they left the room.</t4659>
<t4660>When they reached the attic landing, Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock.</t4660> <t4661>Then he paused, a look of uncertainty in his eyes.</t4661> <t4662>He shuddered.</t4662>
<t4663>—I don't think I can go in —he murmured.</t4663>
<t4664>—It doesn't matter.</t4664> <t4665>I don't need you for anything —replied Campbell coldly.</t4665>
<t4666>Dorian Gray half-opened the door.</t4666> <t4667>As he did so, he saw the face of the portrait, mocking, illuminated by the sunlight.</t4667> <t4668>On the floor in front of it lay the torn curtain.</t4668> <t4669>He remembered that the night before he had forgotten, for the first time in his life, to hide the cursed canvas, and he was about to pounce when he recoiled, trembling.</t4669>
<t4670>What was that repugnant red dew that shone, gleaming and wet, on one of his hands, as if the canvas had sweated blood?</t4670> <t4671>What a horrifying thing!</t4671> <t4672>For a moment it seemed even more horrifying than the silent presence collapsed on the table, the presence whose grotesque shadow on the blood-stained carpet indicated that it remained unmoved, still there, in the same place where he had left it.</t4672>
<t4673>He took a deep breath, opened the door a bit wider, and, with his eyes half-closed and his head turned away, quickly entered, determined not to look at the dead man even once.</t4673> <t4674>Then, bending down, he picked up the purple and gold cloth and threw it directly over the painting.</t4674>
<t4675>Then he froze, fearing to turn around, and his eyes focused on the complexities of the decorative motif in front of him.</t4675> <t4676>He heard Campbell enter the room with the heavy mahogany box, as well as the irons and other things he had requested for his dreadful work.</t4676> <t4677>He began to wonder if Basil Hallward and Alan had ever met and, if so, what they would have thought of each other.</t4677>
<t4678>—Now leave me —said a stern voice behind him.</t4678>
<t4679>Dorian Gray turned around and left hastily, not without noticing that the dead man had leaned back against the chair again and that Campbell was gazing at a yellowish face that was shining.</t4679> <t4680>As he descended the stairs, he heard the key turn in the lock from the inside.</t4680>
<t4681>It had been a while since seven o'clock had struck when Campbell appeared again in the library.</t4681> <t4682>He was pale, but very calm.</t4682>
<t4683>—I have done what you asked me to do —he murmured—.</t4683> <t4684>And now, goodbye.</t4684> <t4685>I hope we never see each other again.</t4685>
<t4686>—You have saved me from disaster, Alan.</t4686> <t4687>That I cannot forget—said Dorian Gray simply.</t4687>
<t4688>As soon as Campbell left the house, he went up to the attic.</t4688> <t4689>In the room, there was a horrible smell of nitric acid.</t4689> <t4690>But the thing sitting at the table had disappeared.</t4690>
<t4691>Chapter 15</t4691>
<t4692>At half past eight, some servants who were lavish with their bows showed Dorian Gray into Lady Narborough's drawing room, dressed to the nines and with a bouquet of Parma violets in the buttonhole of his jacket.</t4692> <t4693>His temples throbbed violently, and he felt seized by an extraordinary nervous agitation, but his manners, when he bowed over his hostess's hand, had the same elegance and naturalness as always.</t4693> <t4694>Perhaps one is never so natural as when playing a role.</t4694> <t4695>Certainly, no one observing Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had just lived through a tragedy comparable to the most horrible of our time.</t4695> <t4696>It was impossible that those delicately chiseled fingers could have wielded a knife with sinful intent or that those smiling lips could have blasphemed and mocked goodness.</t4696> <t4697>He himself could not help but be amazed at his own calmness and, for a few moments, intensely felt the terrible joy of someone successfully leading a double life.</t4697>
<t4698>It was a dinner with few guests, hastily gathered by Lady Narborough, a very intelligent woman, who possessed what Lord Henry used to describe as the remnants of a truly remarkable ugliness, who had turned out to be an excellent wife for one of the most tedious ambassadors of the British crown, and who, after burying her husband with all honors in a marble mausoleum designed by herself, and marrying off her daughters to rich and rather elderly men, had dedicated herself to the pleasures of French narrative, French cuisine, and even French esprit when it was within her reach.</t4698>
<t4699>Dorian was one of her favorite guests, and she always told him that she was very glad not to have known him when she was young.</t4699> <t4700>“I know, my dear, that I would have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say, “and that I would have thrown caution to the wind for your sake.</t4700> <t4701>It's a good thing no one thought of you back then.</t4701> <t4702>However, it may be that the idea of throwing caution to the wind didn't appeal to me much, because I never ended up flirting with anyone.</t4702> <t4703>Although I think the blame was more Narborough's.</t4703> <t4704>He was terribly nearsighted, and there's very little pleasure in deceiving a husband who can't see a thing.”</t4704>
<t4705>His guests that night were rather boring people.</t4705> <t4706>The truth, the hostess explained to Dorian Gray from behind a rather shabby fan, was that one of her married daughters had suddenly shown up to spend some time with her and, to make matters worse, she had done so accompanied by her husband.</t4706>
<t4707>—I believe it was cruel of you, my dear —she whispered—.</t4707> <t4708>It is true that I visit them every summer upon returning from Homburg, but an old woman like me needs fresh air sometimes and, besides, I manage to wake them up.</t4708> <t4709>You cannot imagine the existence they lead.</t4709> <t4710>Pure rural life.</t4710> <t4711>They get up early because they have a lot to do, and they also go to bed early because they have hardly anything to think about.</t4711> <t4712>There hasn't been a scandal around here since the days of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently, everyone falls asleep after dinner.</t4712> <t4713>Please do not sit next to either of them.</t4713> <t4714>Sit next to me.</t4714>
<t4715>Dorian murmured the appropriate compliment and scanned the room with his eyes.</t4715> <t4716>Yes; there wasn't much to be expected from those guests.</t4716> <t4717>Two of the guests he had never seen before, and the rest were: Ernest Harrowden, one of those middle-aged mediocrities that are so abundant in London clubs and who have no enemies but are cordially despised by their friends; Lady Ruxton, a forty-seven-year-old woman with a hooked nose, who dressed extravagantly and always tried to place herself in compromising situations, although, much to her disappointment, no one was ever willing to believe anything against her, given her extreme ugliness; Mrs. Erlynne, a social climber who was a nobody, with a delightful lisp and Venetian red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, the hostess's daughter, a boring young woman without the slightest elegance, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered; and her husband, a creature with ruddy cheeks and gray sideburns who, like so many of his kind, lived convinced that excessive joviality was sufficient excuse for the absolute lack of ideas.</t4717>
<t4718>He was already quite regretful for having accepted the invitation when Lady Narborough, looking at the large golden clock that spread its striking curves over the mantelpiece, covered with mauve cloth, exclaimed</t4718>
<t4719>—How bad it seems to me that Henry Wottom is arriving so late!</t4719> <t4720>This morning, on a whim, I sent a messenger to his house, and he promised with great seriousness not to disappoint me.</t4720>
<t4721>It was a comfort to have Harry's company, and when the door opened and Dorian heard his slow and melodious voice, which lent charm to an insincere apology for his tardiness, his boredom left him.</t4721>
<t4722>During dinner, however, he was unable to eat.</t4722> <t4723>The servants kept removing one dish after another without him tasting anything.</t4723> <t4724>Lady Narborough did not stop scolding him for what she called "an insult to poor Adolphe, who has invented the menu especially for you," and occasionally Lord Henry looked at him from the other side of the table, surprised by his silence and distant demeanor.</t4724> <t4725>From time to time the butler would fill his glass with champagne.</t4725> <t4726>Dorian Gray drank eagerly, but his thirst kept increasing.</t4726>
<t4727>—Dorian —said Lord Henry finally, while serving himself the chaud froid—, what is wrong with you tonight?</t4727> <t4728>You seem downcast.</t4728>
<t4729>—I believe he is in love —exclaimed Lady Narborough—, and he doesn't dare to tell me for fear that I might feel jealous.</t4729> <t4730>And he is absolutely right, because I would feel jealous.</t4730>
<t4731>—My dear Lady Narborough —murmured Dorian Gray, smiling—.</t4731> <t4732>I haven't fallen in love for a whole week; precisely since Madame de Ferroll left London.</t4732>
<t4733>—How is it possible that men fall in love with that woman! —exclaimed the elderly lady—.</t4733> <t4734>It is something I cannot understand.</t4734>
<t4735>—It is simply because Madame de Ferroll remembers the time when you were just a child, Lady Narborough —said Lord Henry—.</t4735> <t4736>She is the only link between us and your short dresses.</t4736>
<t4737>—You don't remember my short dresses at all, Lord Henry.</t4737> <t4738>But I remember you perfectly in Vienna thirty years ago, as well as the necklines you wore back then.</t4738>
<t4739>—She still favors low necklines —replied Lord Henry, picking up an olive with his fingers—, and when she wears a very elegant dress, she looks like a deluxe edition of a bad French novel.</t4739> <t4740>She is truly wonderful and always full of surprises.</t4740> <t4741>Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary.</t4741> <t4742>When her third husband died, her hair turned completely golden from grief.</t4742>
<t4743>—Harry, how dare you! —protested Dorian.</t4743>
<t4744>—It is an extremely romantic explanation —laughed the hostess—.</t4744> <t4745>But, her third husband, Lord Henry!</t4745> <t4746>Are you not suggesting that Ferroll is the fourth?</t4746>
<t4747>—Indeed, Lady Narborough.</t4747>
<t4748>—I don't believe a single word.</t4748>
<t4749>—Well, ask Mr. Gray.</t4749> <t4750>He is one of his closest friends.</t4750>
<t4751>—Is it true, Mr. Gray?</t4751>
<t4752>—That is what she assured me, Lady Narborough —replied Dorian—.</t4752> <t4753>I asked her if, like Margaret of Navarre, she had embalmed the hearts of the deceased to hang them from her waist.</t4753> <t4754>She told me no, because none of them had a heart.</t4754>
<t4755>—Four husbands!</t4755> <t4756>By my faith, that is trop de zéle.</t4756> <t4757>—Trop d'audace, I told him —commented Dorian Gray.</t4757>
<t4758>—It's not audacity that he lacks, my dear.</t4758> <t4759>And, what is Ferroll like?</t4759> <t4760>I don't know him.</t4760>
<t4761>—Husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal class —said Lord Henry, savoring the wine.</t4761> <t4762>Lady Narborough struck him with her fan.</t4762>
<t4763>—Lord Henry, I am not at all surprised that the world says you are extraordinarily wicked.</t4763> <t4764>—But, which world says that? —asked Lord Henry, raising his eyebrows—.</t4764> <t4765>It can only be the world to come.</t4765> <t4766>This world and I maintain excellent relations.</t4766>
<t4767>—All the people I know say that you are the most wicked —exclaimed the elderly lady, shaking her head.</t4767>
<t4768>Lord Henry adopted a serious air for a moment.</t4768> <t4769>"It is perfectly intolerable," he said finally, "the way people go around saying, behind one's back, things that are absolutely and completely true."</t4769> <t4770>"Isn't he incorrigible?" exclaimed Dorian, leaning forward in his seat.</t4770>
<t4771>—I hope so —said the hostess, laughing—.</t4771> <t4772>But if all of you adore Madame de Ferroll in such a ridiculous manner, I will have to remarry to stay in fashion.</t4772>
<t4773>—You will never remarry, Lady Narborough —interjected Lord Henry—.</t4773> <t4774>You were too happy.</t4774> <t4775>When a woman remarries, it is because she detested her first husband.</t4775> <t4776>When a man remarries, it is because he adored his first wife.</t4776> <t4777>Women try their luck.</t4777> <t4778>Men risk theirs.</t4778>
<t4779>—Narborough was not perfect —exclaimed the elderly lady.</t4779>
<t4780>—If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady —was Lord Henry's response—.</t4780> <t4781>Women love us for our defects.</t4781> <t4782>If we have enough of them, they forgive us everything, including intelligence.</t4782> <t4783>I very much fear that after this you will never invite me to dinner again, Lady Narborough, but it is completely true.</t4783>
<t4784>—Of course it's true, Lord Henry.</t4784> <t4785>If women didn't love men for their flaws, where would all of you be?</t4785> <t4786>None would have gotten married.</t4786> <t4787>You would be a collection of unhappy bachelors.</t4787> <t4788>Although that wouldn't have changed you much either.</t4788> <t4789>Nowadays, all married men live like bachelors, and all bachelors like married men.</t4789>
<t4790>—End of the century —murmured Lord Henry.</t4790> <t4791>—End of the world —replied his hostess.</t4791>
<t4792>—Yes, I would like it to be the end of the world —said Dorian with a sigh—.</t4792> <t4793>Life is a great disappointment.</t4793>
<t4794>—Ah, my dear —exclaimed Lady Narborough while putting on her gloves—, don't tell me that you have already exhausted life.</t4794> <t4795>When a man says that, it is known that it is life that has exhausted him.</t4795> <t4796>Lord Henry is very wicked, and sometimes I wish I had been; but you are made to be good: you seem so good that I must find you a charming wife.</t4796> <t4797>Don't you think, Lord Henry, that Mr. Gray should get married?</t4797>
<t4798>—It is what I always tell you, Lady Narborough —replied Lord Henry with a nod of his head.</t4798>
<t4799>—Agreed; in that case, we must find him a good match.</t4799> <t4800>Tonight, I will carefully examine the Debrett and prepare a list of the most suitable young ladies.</t4800>
<t4801>—Without forgetting the age of the candidates, Lady Narborough? —asked Dorian.</t4801>
<t4802>—Without forgetting the age, of course, although slightly revised.</t4802> <t4803>But nothing should be done in a hurry.</t4803> <t4804>I want it to be what The Morning Post calls a convenient match, and for both to be happy.</t4804>
<t4805>—What absurd things people say about happy marriages! —exclaimed Lord Henry—.</t4805> <t4806>A man can be happy with a woman as long as he does not love her.</t4806>
<t4807>—Ah! What cynicism on your part! —said the elderly lady, pushing the chair back and nodding to Lady Ruxton—.</t4807> <t4808>You must come back very soon to have dinner with me.</t4808> <t4809>You are truly an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew prescribes for me.</t4809> <t4810>You must tell me which people you would like to meet.</t4810> <t4811>I want it to be an absolutely delightful evening.</t4811>
<t4812>—I like men with a future and women with a past —replied Lord Henry—.</t4812> <t4813>Or do you think the imbalance would be too great?</t4813>
<t4814>—I greatly fear —she said laughing, as she stood up—.</t4814> <t4815>A thousand pardons, my dear Lady Ruxton —she added instantly—.</t4815> <t4816>I see that you have not finished your cigarette.</t4816>
<t4817>—Don't worry, Lady Narborough.</t4817> <t4818>I smoke too much.</t4818> <t4819>I intend to do it less in the future.</t4819>
<t4820>—Don't do it, I beg you, Lady Ruxton —intervened Lord Henry—.</t4820> <t4821>Moderation is a very pernicious virtue.</t4821> <t4822>Enough is as bad as a meal.</t4822> <t4823>Too much, as good as a feast.</t4823>
<t4824>Lady Ruxton looked at him with curiosity.</t4824>
<t4825>—You will have to come and explain it to me some afternoon, Lord Henry.</t4825> <t4826>It seems like a fascinating theory —he murmured as he left the room.</t4826>
<t4827>—Please, gentlemen, do not spend too much time talking about politics and scandals —exclaimed Lady Narborough from the door—.</t4827> <t4828>If you do, we will end up fighting upstairs.</t4828>
<t4829>The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman solemnly rose from the end of the table and moved to occupy the head.</t4829> <t4830>Dorian Gray also changed his seat and went to place himself next to Lord Henry.</t4830> <t4831>Mr. Chapman began to speak, raising his voice significantly, about the situation in the House of Commons, mocking his adversaries.</t4831> <t4832>The word doctrinaire (a term that inspires terror in British minds) reappeared from time to time amidst his bursts of laughter.</t4832> <t4833>An alliterative prefix served as an ornament to his eloquence, while he raised the flag of the Empire over the pinnacles of Thought.</t4833> <t4834>The innate stupidity of the race (he jovially called it good English common sense) was offered to those present as the bulwark that Society needed.</t4834>
<t4835>A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, who, turning, looked at Dorian.</t4835>
<t4836>—Are you feeling better? —he asked—.</t4836> <t4837>You seemed a bit lost during dinner.</t4837>
<t4838>—I'm perfectly fine, Harry.</t4838> <t4839>A little tired.</t4839> <t4840>That's all.</t4840>
<t4841>—Last night you outdid yourself.</t4841> <t4842>The little duchess only sees through your eyes.</t4842> <t4843>She told me she will go to Selby.</t4843>
<t4844>—He has promised to be there by the twentieth.</t4844> <t4845>—Will Monmouth go as well?</t4845>
<t4846>—Yes, Harry.</t4846>
<t4847>—It bores me terribly, almost as much as it bores her.</t4847> <t4848>My cousin is very intelligent, too intelligent for a woman.</t4848> <t4849>She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.</t4849> <t4850>The feet of clay give all their value to the golden image.</t4850> <t4851>She has beautiful feet, but they are not made of clay.</t4851> <t4852>White porcelain feet, if you like.</t4852> <t4853>They have passed through the fire, and what the fire does not destroy, it hardens.</t4853> <t4854>She has had experiences.</t4854>
<t4855>—How long have you been married? —asked Dorian.</t4855> <t4856>—An eternity, she tells me.</t4856> <t4857>According to the peerage book, I believe ten years, but ten years with Monmouth can be an eternity and even a bit more.</t4857> <t4858>Who are the other guests?</t4858>
<t4859>—The Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, the usual ones.</t4859> <t4860>I have asked Lord Grotrian to go.</t4860>
<t4861>—I like him —said Lord Henry—.</t4861> <t4862>There are many people who disagree, but I find him charming.</t4862> <t4863>He compensates for his occasional excesses in dressing with an always ultra-refined education.</t4863> <t4864>He is a very modern person.</t4864>
<t4865>—I don't know if he will be able to join the group, Harry.</t4865> <t4866>He might have to go to Monte Carlo with his father.</t4866>
<t4867>—Ah! How annoying families are!</t4867> <t4868>Make sure she goes.</t4868> <t4869>By the way, Dorian, you disappeared very early last night.</t4869> <t4870>What did you do afterwards?</t4870> <t4871>Go straight home?</t4871>
<t4872>Dorian looked at him for a moment and frowned.</t4872> <t4873>"No, Harry," he said finally.</t4873> <t4874>"I didn't return home until around three."</t4874>
<t4875>—Did you go to the club?</t4875>
<t4876>—Yes —he replied.</t4876> <t4877>Then he bit his lips—.</t4877> <t4878>No; that wasn't what I meant to say.</t4878> <t4879>I didn't go to the club.</t4879> <t4880>I was out walking.</t4880> <t4881>I don't remember what I did... How inquisitive you are, Harry!</t4881> <t4882>You always want to know what one does.</t4882> <t4883>I always want to forget it.</t4883> <t4884>I got home at half past two, if you want to know the exact time.</t4884> <t4885>I had left my key, and Francis had to open the door for me.</t4885> <t4886>If you need confirmation on that point, you can ask him.</t4886>
<t4887>Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders.</t4887>
<t4888>—My dear friend, as if I cared!</t4888> <t4889>Let's go up to the living room.</t4889> <t4890>No, thank you very much, Mr. Chapman, I don't want sherry.</t4890> <t4891>Something has happened to you, Dorian.</t4891> <t4892>Tell me what it is.</t4892> <t4893>You seem different tonight.</t4893>
<t4894>—Don't take it the wrong way, Harry.</t4894> <t4895>I'm nervous and in a bad mood.</t4895> <t4896>I'll come see you tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</t4896> <t4897>Give my apologies to Lady Narborough.</t4897> <t4898>I'm not going upstairs to join the ladies.</t4898> <t4899>I have to go home.</t4899> <t4900>I must go home.</t4900>
<t4901>—Very well.</t4901> <t4902>I hope to see you tomorrow at tea time.</t4902> <t4903>The duchess will come.</t4903>
<t4904>—I will try to be there —said Dorian Gray, leaving the room.</t4904> <t4905>As he returned home, he realized that the feeling of terror he thought he had suppressed was resurfacing.</t4905> <t4906>Lord Henry's trivial questions had unsettled him for a moment, and he had to keep his composure at all costs.</t4906> <t4907>Dangerous objects had to be destroyed.</t4907> <t4908>His face contorted.</t4908> <t4909>He loathed even the idea of touching them.</t4909>
<t4910>But it had to be done.</t4910> <t4911>He understood it perfectly and, after locking the library door, he opened the secret closet into which he had thrown Basil's coat and briefcase.</t4911> <t4912>A very lively fire was burning in the fireplace.</t4912> <t4913>He added another log.</t4913> <t4914>The smell of burning clothes and leather was horrible.</t4914> <t4915>It took three quarters of an hour for everything to be consumed.</t4915> <t4916>When he finished, he felt weak and dizzy, and after burning some Algerian tablets in a copper censer, he moistened his hands and forehead with musk-scented vinegar.</t4916>
<t4917>Suddenly, he had a start.</t4917> <t4918>His eyes lit up strangely and he began to nibble on his lower lip.</t4918> <t4919>Between two of the library windows, there was a large Florentine mahogany cabinet, inlaid with ivory and lapis lazuli.</t4919> <t4920>He gazed at it as if it were something terrible and fascinating at the same time, as if it contained something he longed for and yet almost loathed.</t4920> <t4921>His breathing quickened.</t4921> <t4922>A furious desire took hold of him.</t4922> <t4923>He lit a cigarette which he discarded moments later.</t4923> <t4924>He let his eyelids drop until his long lashes almost touched his cheek.</t4924> <t4925>But he kept looking at the cabinet.</t4925> <t4926>Finally, he got up from the sofa where he had been lying, approached it, and, after sliding back the latch, touched a hidden spring.</t4926> <t4927>A triangular drawer slowly appeared.</t4927> <t4928>His fingers instinctively moved inside and seized something.</t4928> <t4929>It was a Chinese box of black lacquer covered in gold dust, delicately crafted; its walls were decorated with sinuous undulations, and round crystals and tassels woven with metallic threads hung from the silk cords.</t4929> <t4930>Dorian Gray opened it.</t4930> <t4931>Inside, there was a green paste that had the sheen of wax and emitted a peculiar, dense, and persistent odor.</t4931>
<t4932>He hesitated for a few moments, with a strange, immobile smile on his face.</t4932> <t4933>Then, shivering, although it was very warm in the library, he stood up and looked at the clock.</t4933> <t4934>It was twenty minutes to twelve.</t4934> <t4935>He returned the Chinese box to the writing desk, closed the door, and went to his bedroom.</t4935>
<t4936>When midnight struck twelve bronze chimes in the darkness, Dorian Gray, dressed in inconspicuous clothes and a scarf wrapped around his neck, stealthily left his house.</t4936> <t4937>On Bond Street, he found a hansom cab with a good horse.</t4937> <t4938>He called it, but when he gave an address in a low voice, the cabman shook his head.</t4938>
<t4939>—It's too far for me —he murmured.</t4939>
<t4940>—Here is a sovereign —Dorian Gray said to him—.</t4940> <t4941>I'll give you another if you hurry.</t4941>
<t4942>—Alright, sir —replied the coachman—; we will be there within an hour —and after his passenger got into the vehicle, he turned the horse around and headed quickly towards the river.</t4942>
<t4943>Chapter 16</t4943>
<t4944>A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred streetlights no longer cast anything more than a faded glow through the fog.</t4944> <t4945>It was the time when public establishments were closing, and men and women still gathered in front of their doors began to disperse.</t4945> <t4946>From the interior of some of the taverns, horrible laughter still erupted.</t4946> <t4947>In others, the drunks argued and shouted.</t4947>
<t4948>Almost lying down in the cab, his hat pulled down over his forehead, Dorian Gray gazed indifferently at the sordid abjection of the great city, and from time to time he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him the day they met: "Cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul."</t4948> <t4949>Yes, that was the secret.</t4949> <t4950>Dorian Gray had often tried it and was about to do so again.</t4950> <t4951>There were opium dens where one could buy forgetfulness, dreadful haunts where one could destroy the memory of old sins with the frenzy of newly committed ones.</t4951>
<t4952>The moon, near the horizon, looked like a yellow skull.</t4952> <t4953>From time to time, an enormous deformed cloud extended a long arm and completely obscured it.</t4953> <t4954>The gas lamps grew further apart, and the streets became narrower and gloomier.</t4954> <t4955>On one occasion, the coachman took the wrong path and had to retrace his steps for almost a kilometer.</t4955> <t4956>The horse was enveloped in clouds of vapor when it trampled the puddles.</t4956> <t4957>The windows of the cab became covered with a film of mud resembling gray flannel.</t4957>
<t4958>“Cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!” How those words resonated in his ears!</t4958> <t4959>His soul, of course, had a mortal disease.</t4959> <t4960>Could it be true that the senses could cure it?</t4960> <t4961>Innocent blood had been shed.</t4961> <t4962>How to atone for it?</t4962> <t4963>No; there was no possible atonement; but although forgiveness was impossible, forgetting was not, and Dorian Gray was determined to forget, to trample that memory, to crush it as we crush the viper that has injected its venom into us.</t4963> <t4964>After all, what right did Basil have to speak to him as he had?</t4964> <t4965>Who had granted him the authority to judge others?</t4965> <t4966>He had said dreadful, horrible, unbearable things.</t4966>
<t4967>The cab moved laboriously, slowing down, it seemed to Dorian Gray, with each step.</t4967> <t4968>He violently opened the roof hatch and ordered the driver to speed up.</t4968> <t4969>The terrible craving for opium began to consume him.</t4969> <t4970>His throat burned and his delicate hands had caught a nervous tremor.</t4970> <t4971>Sticking an arm out the window, he fiercely struck the horse with his cane.</t4971> <t4972>The driver laughed and he too used his whip.</t4972> <t4973>Dorian Gray responded by laughing in turn and the other fell silent.</t4973>
<t4974>The journey seemed endless, and the streets resembled the black threads of an immense spider web.</t4974> <t4975>The monotony became unbearable and, as the fog thickened, Dorian Gray felt fear.</t4975>
<t4976>Then they passed by the solitary brick factories.</t4976> <t4977>The fog was less dense there, and he could see the strange bottle-shaped kilns and their tongues of orange fire that spread out like fans.</t4977> <t4978>A dog barked as they passed, and in the distance, in the darkness, a stray seagull screeched.</t4978> <t4979>The horse stumbled in a pothole in the road, swerved, and began to gallop.</t4979>
<t4980>After some time, they left the dirt road and began to rattle along poorly paved streets again.</t4980> <t4981>Most of the windows were dark, but occasionally, fantastic shadows were cast on the blinds illuminated by some lamp.</t4981> <t4982>Dorian Gray watched them with curiosity.</t4982> <t4983>They moved like monstrous puppets and made gestures like living creatures.</t4983> <t4984>He felt that he loathed them.</t4984> <t4985>His heart was dominated by a dull rage.</t4985> <t4986>As they turned a corner, a woman shouted something at them from an open door, and two men ran after the cab for about a hundred meters.</t4986> <t4987>The coachman struck them with his whip.</t4987>
<t4988>It is said that passion makes one think in circles.</t4988> <t4989>And, certainly, the lips that Dorian Gray kept biting formed and reformed, in a dreadful repetition, the subtle words that dealt with the soul and the senses, until he found in them the full expression, so to speak, of his state of mind, and thus justified, by intellectually approving them, passions that without that justification would have dominated his will.</t4989> <t4990>From cell to cell that single idea took hold of his brain; and the frantic desire to live, the most terrible of human appetites, redoubled the vigor of every trembling nerve and muscle.</t4990> <t4991>The ugliness that had once seemed odious to him because it made things real, now seemed kind to him for that very reason.</t4991> <t4992>Ugliness was the only reality.</t4992> <t4993>The vulgar brawl, the repugnant den, the brutal violence of a disordered life, the very vileness of the thief and the outlaw, had more life, created a more intense impression of reality than all the elegant forms of Art, than the dreamy shadows of Song.</t4993> <t4994>They were what he needed to achieve oblivion.</t4994> <t4995>In the span of three days, he would be free.</t4995>
<t4996>Suddenly, the coachman stopped abruptly at the beginning of a shadowy alley.</t4996> <t4997>Above the low rooftops, bristling with chimneys, the black masts of the ships rose.</t4997> <t4998>Spirals of white mist clung to the yards like ghostly sails.</t4998>
<t4999>—It's somewhere around here, isn't it, sir? —asked the coachman in a hoarse voice through the hatch.</t4999>
<t5000>Dorian, startled, looked around.</t5000>
<t5001>—Leave me here —he replied and, after dismounting hastily and handing over the promised money, he hurried away towards the dock.</t5001> <t5002>Here and there a lantern shone on the bow of some gigantic merchant ship.</t5002> <t5003>The light trembled and broke up in the puddles.</t5003> <t5004>From a steamer about to depart, which was stoking the fire to increase boiler pressure, a red glow emerged.</t5004> <t5005>The slippery ground looked like a wet raincoat.</t5005>
<t5006>Dorian Gray hurried to the left, turning his head from time to time to check if someone was following him.</t5006> <t5007>Seven or eight minutes later, he arrived at a dilapidated little house, wedged between two gloomy factories.</t5007> <t5008>A light was shining in one of the upstairs windows.</t5008> <t5009>He stopped at the door and knocked in a peculiar manner.</t5009>
<t5010>After some time, he heard footsteps in the corridor and then the sliding of a bolt.</t5010> <t5011>The door opened silently and Dorian Gray entered without saying a single word to the deformed, chubby creature that pressed itself against the shadowy wall to let him pass.</t5011> <t5012>At the end of the hallway hung a tattered green curtain, swaying and trembling from the gust of wind that followed Dorian Gray from the street.</t5012> <t5013>Pulling it aside, he entered a long, low-ceilinged room that gave the impression of having once been a third-rate ballroom.</t5013> <t5014>On the walls, gas burners hissed and burned, their dim and deformed images reflected in numerous mirrors, blackened with fly specks.</t5014> <t5015>The greasy, wavy tin reflectors placed behind them turned them into trembling discs of light.</t5015> <t5016>The floor was covered with ochre sawdust, which, from being trodden on, had turned into mud, further stained by dark rings of spilled drinks.</t5016> <t5017>Some Malays, crouched by a small charcoal stove, played with bone chips and showed very white teeth as they spoke.</t5017> <t5018>In a corner, with his head hidden in his arms, a sailor had collapsed over a table, and next to the garishly painted bar that occupied one side of the room, two haggard women mocked an old man who was shaking the sleeves of his jacket with an expression of disgust.</t5018>
<t5019>—He thinks he's being attacked by red ants —laughed one of them as Dorian Gray walked past.</t5019>
<t5020>The old man looked at her terrified and began to moan.</t5020>
<t5021>At the back of the room, a small staircase led to a dark room.</t5021> <t5022>As Dorian hurried to ascend the three rickety steps, the dense smell of opium assaulted him.</t5022> <t5023>He took a deep breath, and his nostrils quivered with pleasure.</t5023> <t5024>Upon entering, a young man with smooth blond hair, who was leaning over a lamp lighting a long, very thin pipe, looked in his direction and greeted him hesitantly with a nod.</t5024>
<t5025>—You here, Adrian? —murmured Dorian.</t5025>
<t5026>—Where do you want me to be? —the other responded apathetically—.</t5026> <t5027>All my friends have stopped greeting me.</t5027> <t5028>—I thought you had left England.</t5028>
<t5029>—Darlington will do nothing against me.</t5029> <t5030>My brother ended up paying the debt.</t5030> <t5031>George doesn't speak to me either...</t5031> <t5032>I don't care —he added with a sigh—.</t5032> <t5033>As long as this is not lacking, friends are not needed.</t5033> <t5034>I think I had too many.</t5034>
<t5035>Dorian Gray's face twitched for an instant; then he gazed at the grotesque figures lying on the filthy mattresses in strange postures.</t5035> <t5036>The contorted limbs, the open mouths, the lost gazes, and the glassy eyes fascinated him.</t5036> <t5037>He knew in what strange paradises they indulged in suffering and what sad hells taught them the secret of some new joy.</t5037> <t5038>They were more fortunate than he, a prisoner of his thoughts.</t5038> <t5039>Memory, like a horrible disease, devoured his soul.</t5039> <t5040>From time to time, it seemed to him that he saw Basil Hallward's eyes looking at him.</t5040> <t5041>He understood, however, that he could not stay there.</t5041> <t5042>The presence of Adrian Singleton disturbed him.</t5042> <t5043>He wanted to be in a place where no one knew who he was.</t5043> <t5044>He wanted to flee from himself.</t5044>
<t5045>—I'm going to the other place —he said, after a pause.</t5045>
<t5046>—At the dock?</t5046>
<t5047>—Yes.</t5047>
<t5048>—That crazy cat will definitely be there.</t5048> <t5049>They don't let her in here anymore.</t5049>
<t5050>Dorian shrugged.</t5050>
<t5051>—I am fed up with women who love me.</t5051> <t5052>Women who hate are much more interesting.</t5052> <t5053>Besides, the merchandise is better there.</t5053>
<t5054>—More or less the same thing.</t5054>
<t5055>—I prefer her.</t5055> <t5056>Come have a drink.</t5056> <t5057>I need a drink.</t5057>
<t5058>—I don't want anything —murmured the young man.</t5058>
<t5059>—It doesn't matter.</t5059>
<t5060>Adrian Singleton got up with a tired air and followed Dorian Gray to the bar.</t5060> <t5061>A mulatto, with a tattered turban and a long filthy coat, greeted them with a hideous grin as he placed a bottle of brandy and two glasses before them.</t5061> <t5062>The women approached and began to chatter.</t5062> <t5063>Dorian turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to his companion.</t5063>
<t5064>A smile as twisted as a Malay kris crossed the face of one of the women.</t5064>
<t5065>—How proud we are tonight! —were his mocking words.</t5065>
<t5066>—For the love of God, do not speak to me —exclaimed Dorian, stamping his foot—.</t5066> <t5067>What do you want? Money?</t5067> <t5068>Here you have it.</t5068> <t5069>But do not speak to me again.</t5069>
<t5070>In the woman's eyes, dulled by alcohol, two red flashes appeared for a moment, but they quickly faded, leaving them dead and glassy once again.</t5070> <t5071>Then she shook her head and with greedy fingers gathered the coins from the counter.</t5071> <t5072>Her companion watched her with envy.</t5072>
<t5073>—It's useless —sighed Adrian Singleton—.</t5073> <t5074>I don't feel like going back.</t5074> <t5075>What difference does it make?</t5075> <t5076>I'm very well here.</t5076>
<t5077>—You will write to me if you need anything, alright? —said Dorian after a pause.</t5077>
<t5078>—Maybe.</t5078>
<t5079>—Good night, then.</t5079>
<t5080>—Good evening —replied the young man, going back up the steps while wiping his dry mouth with a handkerchief.</t5080>
<t5081>Dorian walked towards the door with a pained expression on his face.</t5081> <t5082>As he drew aside the green curtain, a ghastly laugh escaped the painted lips of the woman who had collected the coins.</t5082>
<t5083>—There goes the devil's protégé! —he exclaimed in a hoarse voice between two hiccups.</t5083>
<t5084>—Damn you! —responded Dorian—, don't call me that!</t5084>
<t5085>The woman snapped her fingers.</t5085>
<t5086>—Prince Charming is what you like to be called, isn't it? —he shouted at her as he left.</t5086>
<t5087>The drowsy sailor jumped up upon hearing the woman, and looked around with crazed eyes.</t5087> <t5088>The sound of the door closing reached his ears, and he rushed out, as if in pursuit of someone.</t5088>
<t5089>Dorian Gray walked briskly along the dock, indifferent to the rain.</t5089> <t5090>His encounter with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered if that disaster was his responsibility, as Basil Hallward had so insultingly told him.</t5090> <t5091>He bit his lips, and for a moment his eyes filled with sadness.</t5091> <t5092>Although, after all, what did it matter to him?</t5092> <t5093>Life is too short to bear the weight of others' mistakes.</t5093> <t5094>Each person spent their own life and paid their own price for living it.</t5094> <t5095>The only regrettable thing was that for a single fault one had to pay so many times.</t5095> <t5096>That indeed, one had to pay and pay again and keep paying.</t5096> <t5097>In its dealings with human beings, Fate never closed the accounts.</t5097>
<t5098>There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, dominates our being to such an extent that all the fibers of the body, as well as the cells of the brain, are nothing but instinct with horrifying impulses.</t5098> <t5099>In such moments, men and women cease to be free.</t5099> <t5100>They move towards their terrible objective like automatons.</t5100> <t5101>They lose the ability to choose, and the conscience is crushed or, if it lives, it does so to fill rebellion with fascination and to give charm to disobedience.</t5101> <t5102>When that powerful spirit, that perverse morning star fell from heaven, it did so as a rebel.</t5102>
<t5103>Insensible, with no other goal than evil, his spirit contaminated and his soul hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray hurried, quickening his pace as he went.</t5103> <t5104>But at the moment he turned to enter a dark passage that had often served as a shortcut to his destination, he felt himself grabbed from behind, and before he had time to defend himself, he was thrown against the wall, with a brutal hand squeezing his throat.</t5104>
<t5105>He fought desperately and, with a tremendous effort, managed to free himself from the increasing pressure of the fingers.</t5105> <t5106>But a second later he heard the click of a revolver and saw the gleam of a barrel pointing directly at his head, as well as the indistinct silhouette of the short and sturdy individual facing him.</t5106>
<t5107>—What do you want? —he gasped.</t5107>
<t5108>—Stay still —said the other—.</t5108> <t5109>If you move, I'll shoot.</t5109> <t5110>—You've lost your mind.</t5110> <t5111>What do you have against me?</t5111>
<t5112>—You destroyed Sibyl Vane's life —was the response—.</t5112> <t5113>And Sibyl Vane was my sister.</t5113> <t5114>She committed suicide.</t5114> <t5115>I know.</t5115> <t5116>You are responsible.</t5116> <t5117>I swore to kill you.</t5117> <t5118>I've been looking for you for years.</t5118> <t5119>I had no clue or the slightest trace.</t5119> <t5120>The two people who could give me a description of you are dead.</t5120> <t5121>I only knew the affectionate name that Sibyl used.</t5121> <t5122>A moment ago, I heard it by chance.</t5122> <t5123>Make peace with God, because you are going to die tonight.</t5123>
<t5124>Dorian Gray felt sick with fear.</t5124>
<t5125>—I don't know what you're talking about —he stammered—.</t5125> <t5126>I've never heard that name.</t5126> <t5127>You're crazy.</t5127>
<t5128>—He'd better confess his sin, because he's going to die, as surely as my name is James Vane.</t5128>
<t5129>During a terrible moment, Dorian did not know what to do or say.</t5129>
<t5130>—On your knees! —growled his assailant—.</t5130> <t5131>I'll give you one minute to repent, nothing more.</t5131> <t5132>I'm embarking for India, but first I must fulfill my promise.</t5132> <t5133>One minute.</t5133> <t5134>That's all.</t5134>
<t5135>Dorian let his arms fall.</t5135> <t5136>Paralyzed by terror, he didn't know what to do.</t5136> <t5137>Suddenly, a wild hope crossed his mind.</t5137>
<t5138>—Wait —he exclaimed—.</t5138> <t5139>How long has it been since your sister died?</t5139> <t5140>Quickly, tell me!</t5140>
<t5141>—Eighteen years —replied the sailor—.</t5141> <t5142>Why do you ask me that? What difference does it make?</t5142>
<t5143>—Eighteen years —laughed Dorian Gray, with a triumphant tone in his voice—.</t5143> <t5144>Eighteen years! Take me under the light and look at my face!</t5144>
<t5145>James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what it was about.</t5145> <t5146>Then he grabbed Dorian Gray to take him out of the arcades.</t5146>
<t5147>Although the light, due to the violence of the wind, was weak and flickering, it nevertheless allowed him to confirm the horrifying mistake he had apparently made, because the face of his victim possessed all the freshness of adolescence, the spotless purity of youth.</t5147> <t5148>She barely seemed to be over twenty springs; the age his sister had been, if she even reached it, when he first embarked, so many years ago.</t5148> <t5149>Without a doubt, this was not the man who had ruined Sibyl's life.</t5149>
<t5150>James Vane loosened the pressure of his hand and took a step back.</t5150>
<t5151>—My God! —he exclaimed—.</t5151> <t5152>And I was about to kill him!</t5152> <t5153>Dorian Gray breathed deeply.</t5153>
<t5154>—You were about to make a terrible mistake —he said, looking at him sternly—.</t5154> <t5155>Let this be a lesson to you not to take justice into your own hands.</t5155>
<t5156>—Forgive me —murmured the other—.</t5156> <t5157>I was mistaken.</t5157> <t5158>A word heard in that damned den made me confused.</t5158>
<t5159>—It would be better if you go back home and abandon that weapon.</t5159> <t5160>Otherwise, you will have problems —said Dorian Gray, turning around and slowly walking down the street.</t5160>
<t5161>James Vane, horrified, motionless in the middle of the street, began to tremble from head to toe.</t5161> <t5162>Shortly after, a dark shadow that had been stealthily approaching along the wall came into the light and approached him with furtive steps.</t5162> <t5163>The sailor felt a hand on his arm and turned around startled.</t5163> <t5164>It was one of the women who drank in the bar.</t5164>
<t5165>—Why haven't you killed him? —he whispered, bringing his haggard face very close to James's—.</t5165> <t5166>I realized you were following him when you ran out of Daly's house.</t5166> <t5167>Poor fool!</t5167> <t5168>You should have killed him.</t5168> <t5169>He has a lot of money and is the worst of the worst.</t5169>
<t5170>—He is not the man I am looking for —replied James Vane—, and I am not interested in anyone's money.</t5170> <t5171>I want a life.</t5171> <t5172>The one I am looking for is around forty.</t5172> <t5173>The one I let go is little more than a child.</t5173> <t5174>Thank God I have not stained my hands with his blood.</t5174>
<t5175>The woman let out a bitter laugh.</t5175>
<t5176>—Little more than a child! —he repeated in a mocking voice—.</t5176> <t5177>My poor dear, it's been almost eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am.</t5177>
<t5178>—You're lying! —exclaimed the sailor.</t5178>
<t5179>The woman raised her arms to the sky.</t5179>
<t5180>—I swear to God I'm telling you the truth! —he exclaimed.</t5180>
<t5181>—Before God?</t5181>
<t5182>—May I be struck dumb if it isn't true.</t5182> <t5183>He is the worst of all the scoundrels that come around here.</t5183> <t5184>They say he sold his soul to the devil for a pretty face.</t5184> <t5185>I've known him for almost eighteen years.</t5185> <t5186>He hasn't changed much since then.</t5186> <t5187>I, on the other hand, have —she added with a horrible grimace.</t5187>
<t5188>—Do you swear to me that it's true?</t5188>
<t5189>—I swear —the two words came out like a hoarse echo from his sunken mouth—.</t5189> <t5190>But don't tell him that I reported him —he whimpered—.</t5190> <t5191>I'm afraid of him.</t5191> <t5192>Give me something to pay for a bed tonight.</t5192>
<t5193>James Vane moved away from her with a curse and ran to the corner of the street, but Dorian Gray had disappeared.</t5193> <t5194>When he looked back, he couldn't find the woman either.</t5194>
<t5195>Chapter 17</t5195>
<t5196>A week later, Dorian Gray, in the conservatory of Selby Royal, was speaking with the Duchess of Monmouth, a very beautiful woman who, along with her husband, a weary-looking sexagenarian, was among his guests.</t5196> <t5197>It was tea time, and on the table, the soft light of the large lace-covered lamp illuminated the delicate porcelain and the embossed silver of the service.</t5197> <t5198>The Duchess was playing hostess: her white hands moved harmoniously among the cups, and her sensuous red lips smiled as she listened to the words Dorian whispered in her ear.</t5198> <t5199>Lord Henry, reclining in a wicker chair covered with a silk cloth, watched them.</t5199> <t5200>Seated on a peach-colored divan, Lady Narborough pretended to listen to the Duke's description of the latest Brazilian beetle he had just added to his collection.</t5200> <t5201>Three young men elegantly dressed in tuxedos offered tea pastries to some of the ladies.</t5201> <t5202>The guests formed a group of twelve people, and a few more were expected to arrive the next day.</t5202>
<t5203>—What are you talking about? —asked Lord Henry, approaching the table and setting down the cup—.</t5203> <t5204>I trust that Dorian has told you about my plan to rename everything, Gladys.</t5204> <t5205>It's a delightful idea.</t5205>
<t5206>—But I don't want to change my name, Harry —replied the duchess, bestowing him with a wonderful look of reproach—.</t5206> <t5207>I like the one I have very much, and I am sure that Mr. Gray is also satisfied with his.</t5207>
<t5208>—My dear Gladys, I wouldn't change the name of either of you for anything in the world.</t5208> <t5209>Both are perfect.</t5209> <t5210>I was mostly thinking about the flowers.</t5210> <t5211>Yesterday I cut an orchid to put in my buttonhole.</t5211> <t5212>It was a small speckled marvel, as effective as the seven deadly sins.</t5212> <t5213>In a moment of unconsciousness, I asked one of the gardeners what it was called.</t5213> <t5214>He told me it was a beautiful specimen of Robinsoniana or some other similar horror.</t5214> <t5215>It's a sad truth, but we have lost the ability to give pleasant names to things.</t5215> <t5216>Names are everything.</t5216> <t5217>I never complain about actions, only about words.</t5217> <t5218>That is why I abhor vulgar realism in literature.</t5218> <t5219>The person capable of calling a spade a spade should be forced to use it.</t5219> <t5220>It's the only thing it's good for.</t5220>
<t5221>—And you, Harry, what should we call you? —asked the duchess.</t5221>
<t5222>—His name is Prince Paradox —said Dorian.</t5222>
<t5223>—There is no doubt that it is him! —exclaimed the duchess.</t5223>
<t5224>—By no means —laughed Lord Henry, dropping into a chair—.</t5224> <t5225>There is no way to escape a label!</t5225> <t5226>I reject that title.</t5226>
<t5227>—Royalty must not abdicate —was the warning issued by some beautiful lips.</t5227>
<t5228>—Do you wish, then, that I defend my throne?</t5228>
<t5229>—Yes.</t5229>
<t5230>—I offer the truths of tomorrow.</t5230>
<t5231>—I prefer today's mistakes —she replied.</t5231> <t5232>—You disarm me, Gladys —exclaimed Lord Henry, noticing the stubbornness of her attitude.</t5232>
<t5233>—Of your shield, but not of your spear.</t5233>
<t5234>—I never attack beauty —he said, making a gesture of submission with his hand.</t5234>
<t5235>—That is your mistake, Harry, believe me.</t5235> <t5236>You value beauty too much.</t5236>
<t5237>—How can you say that?</t5237> <t5238>I recognize that, in my opinion, it is better to be beautiful than good.</t5238> <t5239>But, on the other hand, no one is more willing than I am to admit that it is better to be good than ugly.</t5239>
<t5240>—In that case, is ugliness one of the seven deadly sins? —exclaimed the duchess—.</t5240> <t5241>And what about your metaphor about the orchid?</t5241>
<t5242>—Ugliness is one of the seven capital virtues, Gladys.</t5242> <t5243>You, as a good Tory, should not underestimate them.</t5243> <t5244>Beer, the Bible, and the seven capital virtues have made our England what it is.</t5244>
<t5245>—Does that mean you don't like your country? —asked the duchess.</t5245>
<t5246>—I live in it.</t5246>
<t5247>—To be able to censor it better.</t5247>
<t5248>"Do you prefer that I accept Europe's verdict?" Lord Henry wanted to know.</t5248>
<t5249>—What do they say about us?</t5249>
<t5250>—That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.</t5250>
<t5251>—Is that your own doing, Harry?</t5251>
<t5252>—I give it to you as a gift.</t5252>
<t5253>—I couldn't use it.</t5253> <t5254>It's too true.</t5254>
<t5255>—You have no reason to be scared.</t5255> <t5256>Our compatriots never recognize a description.</t5256>
<t5257>—They are practical people.</t5257>
<t5258>—They are more cunning than practical.</t5258> <t5259>When it comes to accounting, they compensate stupidity with wealth and vice with hypocrisy.</t5259>
<t5260>—We have done great things, anyway.</t5260>
<t5261>—Great things have come upon us, Gladys.</t5261>
<t5262>—We have carried their weight.</t5262>
<t5263>—Just to the Stock Exchange building.</t5263>
<t5264>The duchess moved her head.</t5264>
<t5265>—I believe in the race —he exclaimed.</t5265>
<t5266>—The race represents the triumph of the social climbers.</t5266>
<t5267>—That means progress.</t5267>
<t5268>—Decadence fascinates me more.</t5268>
<t5269>—And where do you leave art? —she asked.</t5269>
<t5270>—It's an illness.</t5270>
<t5271>—Love?</t5271>
<t5272>—An illusion.</t5272>
<t5273>—Religion?</t5273>
<t5274>—The elegant substitute for faith.</t5274>
<t5275>—You are a skeptic.</t5275>
<t5276>—Never!</t5276> <t5277>Skepticism is the beginning of faith.</t5277>
<t5278>—What are you then?</t5278>
<t5279>—To define is to limit.</t5279>
<t5280>—Give me a hint.</t5280>
<t5281>—The threads break.</t5281> <t5282>You would get lost in the labyrinth.</t5282>
<t5283>—You baffle me.</t5283> <t5284>Let's talk about other people.</t5284>
<t5285>—Our host is an unbeatable topic.</t5285> <t5286>Years ago, they gave him the name Prince Charming.</t5286>
<t5287>—Ah! Don't remind me —exclaimed Dorian Gray.</t5287>
<t5288>—Our host is not very kind today -replied the duchess, blushing—.</t5288> <t5289>In my opinion, he believes that Monmouth married me for purely scientific reasons, for being the best available specimen of the modern butterfly.</t5289>
<t5290>"I hope you are not keeping her by sticking pins into her, Duchess," laughed Dorian.</t5290>
<t5291>—My maid already does that, Mr. Gray, when she's angry with me.</t5291>
<t5292>—And, what reasons does she have to be angry with you, Duchess?</t5292>
<t5293>—The most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you.</t5293> <t5294>Usually, I show up at ten to nine and tell him that I must be dressed by half-past eight.</t5294>
<t5295>—How unreasonable of her!</t5295> <t5296>You should fire her.</t5296>
<t5297>—I don't dare, Mr. Gray.</t5297> <t5298>She invents hats for me, to say the least.</t5298> <t5299>Do you remember the one I wore to Lady Hilstone's outdoor party?</t5299> <t5300>Of course you don't, but you're very kind to pretend otherwise.</t5300> <t5301>Well, she made it for me out of nothing.</t5301> <t5302>All good hats are made out of nothing.</t5302>
<t5303>—Like all good reputations, Gladys —interrupted Lord Henry—.</t5303> <t5304>Every effect one produces creates an enemy.</t5304> <t5305>To achieve popularity, one must be mediocre.</t5305>
<t5306>—Not in the case of women —said the duchess, shaking her head—; and women rule the world.</t5306> <t5307>I assure you they do not tolerate mediocrity.</t5307> <t5308>We women, as someone says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if you ever love at all.</t5308>
<t5309>—I would say we hardly do anything else —murmured Dorian.</t5309>
<t5310>—In that case, Mr. Gray, you never truly love —said the duchess with feigned sadness.</t5310>
<t5311>—My dear Gladys! —exclaimed Lord Henry—.</t5311> <t5312>How can you say that?</t5312> <t5313>Romantic feeling is nourished by repetition, and repetition turns an appetite into art.</t5313> <t5314>Moreover, every time one loves is the only time one has ever loved.</t5314> <t5315>The diversity of the object does not alter the uniqueness of the passion.</t5315> <t5316>It only intensifies it.</t5316> <t5317>At best, we can only have one experience in life, and the secret is to reproduce it as frequently as possible.</t5317>
<t5318>—Even when one has been hurt by it, Harry? —asked the Duchess after a pause.</t5318> <t5319>—Especially when one has been hurt —responded Lord Henry.</t5319>
<t5320>The duchess turned to look at Dorian Gray with a curious expression in her eyes.</t5320>
<t5321>—What do you say to that, Mr. Gray? —he wanted to know.</t5321> <t5322>Dorian hesitated for a moment.</t5322> <t5323>Then he threw his head back and laughed.</t5323>
<t5324>—I always agree with Harry, Duchess.</t5324> <t5325>—Even when he's wrong?</t5325>
<t5326>—Harry is never wrong, Duchess.</t5326>
<t5327>—And, does your philosophy make you happy?</t5327>
<t5328>—Happiness has never been my goal.</t5328> <t5329>Who wants happiness?</t5329> <t5330>I have always sought pleasure.</t5330>
<t5331>—And have you found it, Mr. Gray?</t5331>
<t5332>—Often.</t5332> <t5333>Too often.</t5333>
<t5334>The duchess sighed.</t5334>
<t5335>—My goal is peace —he said—.</t5335> <t5336>And if I don't leave and get dressed, I won't have any tonight.</t5336>
<t5337>—Allow me to bring you some orchids, Duchess —exclaimed Dorian, standing up and moving towards the back of the greenhouse.</t5337>
<t5338>—You flirt outrageously with him —Lord Henry said to his cousin—.</t5338> <t5339>I advise you to be cautious.</t5339> <t5340>He is a fascinating creature.</t5340>
<t5341>—If it weren't so, there wouldn't be a struggle.</t5341>
<t5342>—Is it then a Greek against another?</t5342>
<t5343>—I am on the side of the Trojans.</t5343> <t5344>They fought for a woman.</t5344>
<t5345>—They were defeated.</t5345>
<t5346>—There are worse things than being captured —she replied.</t5346>
<t5347>—You gallop off and let go of the reins.</t5347>
<t5348>—Speed is life —was his response.</t5348>
<t5349>—I will write it in my diary tonight.</t5349>
<t5350>—What will you write down?</t5350>
<t5351>—That a child with burns likes fire.</t5351>
<t5352>—I haven't even singed myself.</t5352> <t5353>My wings are intact.</t5353>
<t5354>—You use them for everything except flying.</t5354>
<t5355>—Courage has passed from men to women.</t5355> <t5356>It is a new experience for us.</t5356>
<t5357>—You have a rival.</t5357> <t5358>—Who?</t5358>
<t5359>His cousin burst out laughing.</t5359>
<t5360>—Lady Narborough—he whispered—.</t5360> <t5361>She adores him.</t5361>
<t5362>—You fill me with apprehension.</t5362> <t5363>We romantics cannot compete with the allure of Antiquity.</t5363>
<t5364>—Romantics!</t5364> <t5365>You employ all the methods of science.</t5365>
<t5366>—Men have educated us.</t5366>
<t5367>—But they haven't explained it to you.</t5367>
<t5368>—Describe women —was his challenge.</t5368>
<t5369>Sphinxes without secrets.</t5369>
<t5370>She looked at him, smiling.</t5370>
<t5371>—How long Mr. Gray is taking! —he said—.</t5371> <t5372>Let's go help him.</t5372> <t5373>I haven't told him the color of my dress.</t5373>
<t5374>—Ah! You will have to choose the dress according to its flowers, Gladys.</t5374>
<t5375>—That would be a premature surrender.</t5375>
<t5376>—Romantic art begins at the climactic moment.</t5376>
<t5377>—I must reserve myself a possibility of withdrawal.</t5377>
<t5378>—In the manner of the Parthians?</t5378>
<t5379>—They found salvation in the desert.</t5379> <t5380>That is beyond my reach.</t5380>
<t5381>—Women are not always allowed to choose —replied Lord Henry.</t5381>
<t5382>But just as the sentence was finished, from the farthest end of the greenhouse came a muffled groan, followed by the dull sound of a fall.</t5382> <t5383>Everyone was startled.</t5383> <t5384>The duchess remained motionless, horrified.</t5384> <t5385>And Lord Henry, fear in his eyes, ran through the swaying palm trees until he found Dorian Gray lying face down on the tiled floor, a victim of a fainting spell that resembled death.</t5385>
<t5386>He was instantly transported to the blue room, placing him on one of the sofas.</t5386> <t5387>Shortly after, he regained consciousness and looked around with a bewildered air.</t5387>
<t5388>—What has happened? —he asked—.</t5388> <t5389>Ah! Now I remember.</t5389> <t5390>Am I safe here, Harry? —and he began to tremble.</t5390>
<t5391>—My dear Dorian —responded Lord Henry—, you have merely fainted.</t5391> <t5392>That is all.</t5392> <t5393>You must have overexerted yourself.</t5393> <t5394>It would be better if you didn't come down for dinner.</t5394> <t5395>I will take your place.</t5395>
<t5396>—No; I will go down —he said, standing up with some effort—.</t5396> <t5397>I prefer to do it.</t5397> <t5398>I must not stay alone.</t5398>
<t5399>He went to his room to get dressed.</t5399> <t5400>When he sat down at the table, there was a strange reckless joy in his demeanor, although, from time to time, a shudder ran through him as he remembered that, crushed like a white handkerchief against the glass of the greenhouse, he had seen the face of James Vane watching him.</t5400>
<t5401>Chapter 18</t5401>
<t5402>The next day, Dorian Gray did not leave the house and, in fact, spent most of the time in his room, gripped by a mad fear of dying and, yet, indifferent to life.</t5402> <t5403>The conviction of being pursued, of traps being set for him, of being cornered, began to dominate him.</t5403> <t5404>If the wind slightly stirred the tapestries, he would start to tremble.</t5404> <t5405>The dry leaves thrown against the glass panes seemed to him the image of his abandoned resolutions and his vain regrets.</t5405> <t5406>When he closed his eyes, he saw again the face of the sailor looking through the fogged glass, and he believed he felt once more how horror gripped his heart.</t5406>
<t5407>Although perhaps only his imagination had conjured the vengeance of the night, placing before his eyes the horrible forms of punishment.</t5407><t5408>Real life was chaotic, but imagination followed a terrible logic.</t5408><t5409>Imagination sent remorse in the footsteps of sin.</t5409><t5410>Imagination made each crime conceive its monstrous progeny.</t5410><t5411>In the ordinary universe of facts, the wicked were not punished, nor were the good rewarded.</t5411><t5412>Success belonged to the strong and failure befell the weak.</t5412><t5413>That was all.</t5413><t5414>Moreover, if some stranger had been lurking around the house, the servants or the guards would have seen him.</t5414><t5415>If footprints had been found in the flowerbeds, the gardeners would have reported it.</t5415><t5416>Undoubtedly, it was only his imagination.</t5416><t5417>Sibyl Vane's brother had not come to Selby Royal to kill him.</t5417><t5418>He had set sail on his ship only to finally sink in some winter sea.</t5418><t5419>From him, at least, he had nothing to fear.</t5419><t5420>That poor wretch didn't even know who he was, couldn't know who he was.</t5420><t5421>The mask of youth had saved him.</t5421>
<t5422>But if it had only been an illusion, how terrible to think that the mind could spawn such fearful phantoms, giving them visible form, making them move like real beings!</t5422> <t5423>What kind of life would his be if, day and night, shadows of his crime watched him from silent corners, mocked him from secret places, whispered in his ear in the midst of a banquet, woke him with icy fingers while he slept?</t5423> <t5424>As this idea presented itself in his brain, he turned pale with terror and had the impression that the air had suddenly cooled.</t5424> <t5425>In what dreadful hour of madness had he murdered his friend!</t5425> <t5426>How atrocious the mere memory of the scene!</t5426> <t5427>He saw it all again.</t5427> <t5428>Every hateful detail appeared to him with renewed horror.</t5428> <t5429>From the black cavern of time, terrible and wrapped in scarlet, rose the image of his sin.</t5429> <t5430>When Lord Henry arrived at six o'clock sharp, he found him crying like someone whose heart was about to break.</t5430>
<t5431>Only on the third day did he venture out.</t5431> <t5432>There was something in the clear air of that winter morning, in which the scent of pines floated, that seemed to restore his joy and zest for life.</t5432> <t5433>But it was not only the external conditions that had caused the change.</t5433> <t5434>His own nature was rebelling against the excess of anguish that had tried to alter, to mutilate, his perfect serenity.</t5434> <t5435>It is always so with subtle and delicate temperaments.</t5435> <t5436>Their burning passions either wound or yield.</t5436> <t5437>They kill or die.</t5437> <t5438>Superficial sufferings and loves live long.</t5438> <t5439>Great loves and sufferings are destroyed by their own fullness.</t5439> <t5440>Dorian Gray was also convinced that he had been the victim of a terrified imagination, and he now viewed the fears of yesterday with a bit of compassion and a good dose of contempt.</t5440>
<t5441>After breakfast, he walked with the duchess in the garden for an hour, and then crossed the park by carriage to join the hunting party.</t5441> <t5442>The morning frost covered the grass like a mantle of salt.</t5442> <t5443>The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal.</t5443> <t5444>A thin layer of ice bordered the still lake where the reeds grew.</t5444>
<t5445>At the edge of the pine forest, he recognized Sir Geoffrey Clouston, the Duchess's brother, who was ejecting two spent cartridges from his hunting rifle.</t5445> <t5446>Dismounting from the vehicle, after telling the groom to return with the mare, he made his way to his guest through the dry ferns and thick underbrush.</t5446>
<t5447>—Good hunting, Geoffrey? —he asked.</t5447>
<t5448>—Not too good, Dorian.</t5448> <t5449>It seems to me that most of the birds have already flown out into the open sky.</t5449> <t5450>I hope we have better luck after lunch, when we start another drive.</t5450>
<t5451>Dorian walked by his side.</t5451> <t5452>The intensely aromatic air, the brown and red glows that momentarily appeared in the pine forest, the hoarse cries of the beaters that occasionally echoed, and the dry noise of the gunshots that followed were a source of fascination for him, filling him with a delightful sense of freedom.</t5452> <t5453>He was dominated by the carefree nature of happiness, the supreme indifference of joy.</t5453>
<t5454>Suddenly, from a thick clump of yellowish grass, about twenty meters from where they were standing, with its black-tipped ears erect, hopping on its long hind legs, a hare emerged, which immediately headed towards a group of alders.</t5454> <t5455>Sir Geoffrey raised his shotgun to his shoulder, but something in the agile movements of the animal strangely captivated Dorian Gray, who immediately shouted:</t5455>
<t5456>—Don't shoot, Geoffrey! Let her live.</t5456>
<t5457>—How absurd, Dorian! —laughed Clouston, shooting as the hare leaped into the thicket.</t5457> <t5458>Two cries were heard: the terrible one of the mortally wounded hare, and the even worse one of a dying human being.</t5458>
<t5459>—Good heavens! I've hit a beater! —exclaimed Sir Geoffrey—.</t5459> <t5460>What stupidity to get in front of the guns!</t5460> <t5461>Stop shooting! —he shouted with all his might—.</t5461> <t5462>There is an injured person.</t5462>
<t5463>The chief guard arrived running with a baton in his hand.</t5463>
<t5464>—Where, sir? Where is it? —he shouted.</t5464> <t5465>At the same time, the fire ceased along the entire line.</t5465>
<t5466>—There —replied Sir Geoffrey very irritated, approaching the grove—.</t5466> <t5467>Why the devil don't you control your men?</t5467> <t5468>They have ruined an entire day of hunting for me.</t5468>
<t5469>Dorian watched them as they entered the alder grove, pushing aside the thin, flexible branches.</t5469> <t5470>Seeing them reappear a few moments later, dragging a lifeless body which they brought into the sunlight, he turned away in horror.</t5470> <t5471>It seemed to him that misfortunes followed him wherever he went.</t5471> <t5472>He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the chief gamekeeper's affirmative response.</t5472> <t5473>Suddenly, he had the impression that the forest was filled with faces.</t5473> <t5474>He heard the footsteps of thousands of feet and a confused murmur of voices.</t5474> <t5475>A large pheasant with a coppery breast flew flapping through the highest branches.</t5475>
<t5476>After a few moments that felt to him, given the agitation of his spirit, like endless hours of pain, he felt a hand rest on his shoulder.</t5476> <t5477>Startled, he turned his gaze.</t5477>
<t5478>—Dorian —said Lord Henry—.</t5478> <t5479>It would be better to tell them that the hunt is over for today.</t5479> <t5480>It wouldn't seem right to continue.</t5480>
<t5481>—I would like to stop it forever, Harry —he responded bitterly—.</t5481> <t5482>Everything is horrible and cruel.</t5482> <t5483>Is it...?</t5483>
<t5484>He couldn't finish the sentence.</t5484>
<t5485>—I greatly fear so —replied Lord Henry—.</t5485> <t5486>The shot hit him squarely in the chest.</t5486> <t5487>He must have died almost instantly.</t5487> <t5488>Come; let's go back home.</t5488>
<t5489>They started walking, side by side, towards the promenade, and covered almost fifty meters without speaking.</t5489> <t5490>Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said, with a deep sigh:</t5490>
<t5491>—It's a bad omen, Harry; a terrible omen.</t5491>
<t5492>—What do you mean? —asked Lord Henry—.</t5492> <t5493>Ah, you're talking about the accident, I imagine.</t5493> <t5494>But, who could have foreseen it?</t5494> <t5495>It was his fault.</t5495> <t5496>What was he doing in front of the firing line?</t5496> <t5497>In any case, it's not our concern.</t5497> <t5498>Annoying for Geoffrey, no doubt.</t5498> <t5499>It's not well-regarded to shoot beaters.</t5499> <t5500>It makes people think one doesn't know where they're aiming.</t5500> <t5501>And Geoffrey knows perfectly well; where he sets his eye, he sets his bullet.</t5501> <t5502>But it's no use talking about this matter.</t5502>
<t5503>Dorian shook his head.</t5503>
<t5504>—It's a bad omen, Harry.</t5504> <t5505>I feel like something horrible is going to happen to one of us.</t5505> <t5506>To me, perhaps —he added, passing his hands over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.</t5506>
<t5507>His older friend burst out laughing.</t5507>
<t5508>—The only horrible thing in the world is ennui, Dorian.</t5508> <t5509>That is the only sin that is unforgivable.</t5509> <t5510>But it is unlikely that we will suffer from it, unless our friends continue talking during dinner about what happened.</t5510> <t5511>I must tell them that it is a taboo subject.</t5511> <t5512>As for omens, there is no such thing.</t5512> <t5513>Fate does not send us heralds.</t5513> <t5514>It is too prudent or too cruel for that.</t5514> <t5515>Besides, what the hell could happen to you?</t5515> <t5516>You have everything a man could desire.</t5516> <t5517>Anyone would trade places with you.</t5517>
<t5518>—There is no one with whom I wouldn't be willing to trade places, Harry.</t5518> <t5519>Don't laugh like that.</t5519> <t5520>I'm telling you the truth.</t5520> <t5521>That poor peasant who just died is luckier than I am.</t5521> <t5522>I'm not afraid of death.</t5522> <t5523>It's the way it comes that terrifies me.</t5523> <t5524>Its monstrous wings seem to whirl in the leaden air around me.</t5524> <t5525>Good heavens!</t5525> <t5526>Didn't you see a man moving behind those trees, an individual who is watching me, who is waiting for me?</t5526>
<t5527>Lord Henry looked in the direction indicated by the trembling gloved hand.</t5527>
<t5528>—Yes —he said, smiling—; I see a gardener waiting for you.</t5528> <t5529>I imagine he wants to ask you which flowers you want on the table tonight.</t5529> <t5530>How incredibly nervous you are, my dear friend!</t5530> <t5531>You must go see my doctor when you return to London.</t5531>
<t5532>Dorian let out a sigh of relief upon seeing the gardener approach, who, touching his hat, looked at Lord Henry for a moment, as if hesitant, and then took out a letter, which he handed to his master.</t5532>
<t5533>—His grace told me to wait for the response —he murmured.</t5533>
<t5534>Dorian put the letter in his pocket.</t5534>
<t5535>—Tell his grace that I will arrive shortly —he responded coldly.</t5535> <t5536>The messenger turned around, quickly returning to the house.</t5536>
<t5537>—How much women love to do dangerous things! —laughed Lord Henry—.</t5537> <t5538>It is one of the qualities I admire most in them.</t5538> <t5539>A woman can flirt with anyone as long as there are other people watching.</t5539>
<t5540>—How much you like to say dangerous things, Harry!</t5540> <t5541>In this case, you are completely wrong.</t5541> <t5542>I like the duchess a lot, but I am not in love with her.</t5542>
<t5543>—And the duchess loves you more than she likes you, so you are perfectly matched.</t5543>
<t5544>—That is defamation, Harry, and there is never any reason for defamation!</t5544>
<t5545>—The basis of all slander is an immoral certainty —said Lord Henry, lighting a cigarette.</t5545> <t5546>—You would sacrifice anyone for an epigram.</t5546>
<t5547>—The world is heading towards the altar by its own decision —was the response.</t5547>
<t5548>—I would like to be able to love —exclaimed Dorian Gray with a note of deep pathos in his voice—.</t5548> <t5549>But it seems that I have lost passion and forgotten desire.</t5549> <t5550>I am too focused on myself.</t5550> <t5551>My personality has become a burden.</t5551> <t5552>I want to escape, get away, forget.</t5552> <t5553>It was foolish to come back here.</t5553> <t5554>I think I will telegraph Harvey to prepare the yacht.</t5554> <t5555>On the yacht, I will be safe.</t5555>
<t5556>—Safe from what, Dorian? Do you have a problem.</t5556> <t5557>Why don't you tell me what it's about?</t5557> <t5558>You know I would help you.</t5558> <t5559>—I can't tell you, Harry—he responded sadly—.</t5559> <t5560>And I suppose it's just my imagination.</t5560> <t5561>That unfortunate accident has unsettled me.</t5561> <t5562>I have a horrible premonition that something similar could happen to me.</t5562>
<t5563>—How absurd!</t5563>
<t5564>—I hope you're right, but that's how I feel.</t5564> <t5565>Ah! There is the duchess, who looks like Artemis in a tailored suit.</t5565> <t5566>You see that we are back, duchess.</t5566>
<t5567>—I have been informed of everything, Mr. Gray —she replied—.</t5567> <t5568>Poor Geoffrey is terribly affected.</t5568> <t5569>And it seems you had asked him not to shoot at the hare.</t5569> <t5570>How curious!</t5570>
<t5571>—Yes; very curious.</t5571> <t5572>I don't know what pushed me to say it.</t5572> <t5573>A sudden impulse, I suppose.</t5573> <t5574>It seemed like a charming little creature to me.</t5574> <t5575>I'm sorry they told you about the scout.</t5575> <t5576>It's a regrettable thing.</t5576>
<t5577>—It's an annoying topic —interjected Lord Henry—.</t5577> <t5578>It lacks psychological value.</t5578> <t5579>On the other hand, if Geoffrey had done it on purpose, how interesting it would be!</t5579> <t5580>I would like to meet a real murderer.</t5580>
<t5581>—How unpleasant you are, Harry! —exclaimed the duchess—.</t5581> <t5582>Don't you think so, Mr. Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is feeling unwell again.</t5582> <t5583>I think he is going to faint.</t5583> <t5584>Dorian made an effort to recover and smiled.</t5584>
<t5585>—It's nothing, Duchess —he murmured—; it's just that I'm very nervous.</t5585> <t5586>Nothing more than that.</t5586> <t5587>I'm afraid I've walked too much this morning.</t5587> <t5588>I didn't hear what Harry said.</t5588> <t5589>Something very inappropriate?</t5589> <t5590>You'll have to tell me another time.</t5590> <t5591>I think I'm going to lie down for a while.</t5591> <t5592>You will excuse me, won't you?</t5592>
<t5593>They had already reached the grand staircase that led from the greenhouse to the terrace.</t5593> <t5594>As the glass door closed behind Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at his cousin with languid eyes.</t5594>
<t5595>—Are you very much in love with him? —he asked.</t5595>
<t5596>The duchess took some time to respond, contemplating the landscape motionlessly.</t5596>
<t5597>—I would like to know —he said, finally.</t5597>
<t5598>Lord Henry shook his head.</t5598>
<t5599>—Knowing it would be fatal.</t5599> <t5600>It is the uncertainty that attracts us.</t5600> <t5601>A little fog improves things a lot.</t5601>
<t5602>—You can lose the way.</t5602>
<t5603>—All roads lead to the same place, my dear Gladys.</t5603>
<t5604>—What is...?</t5604>
<t5605>—The disappointment.</t5605>
<t5606>—It was my debut in life —sighed the duchess.</t5606>
<t5607>—But he arrived with the ducal crown.</t5607>
<t5608>—I'm fed up with strawberry leaves.</t5608>
<t5609>—They look good on you.</t5609>
<t5610>—Only in public.</t5610>
<t5611>—You would miss them —said Lord Henry.</t5611>
<t5612>—I wouldn't give up even a single petal.</t5612>
<t5613>—Monmouth has ears.</t5613>
<t5614>—The elderly are hard of hearing.</t5614>
<t5615>—Have you never been jealous?</t5615>
<t5616>—I wish I had had them.</t5616>
<t5617>Lord Henry looked around as if he were searching for something.</t5617>
<t5618>—What are you looking for? —she asked.</t5618>
<t5619>—The button of your foil —he replied—.</t5619> <t5620>It just fell off.</t5620>
<t5621>The duchess burst out laughing.</t5621>
<t5622>—I still have the mask left.</t5622>
<t5623>—It makes your eyes look even more beautiful —was his response.</t5623>
<t5624>Her cousin laughed again.</t5624> <t5625>Her teeth shone like white seeds in a scarlet fruit.</t5625>
<t5626>On the upper floor, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa in his room, feeling every fiber of his body vibrate with terror.</t5626> <t5627>Suddenly, life had become an unbearable burden.</t5627> <t5628>The horrible death of the unfortunate gamekeeper, struck down among the underbrush like a wild animal, had seemed to him a prefiguration of his own death.</t5628> <t5629>He had almost fainted upon hearing the cynical joke that Lord Henry had made at random.</t5629>
<t5630>At five o'clock, he called his servant and ordered him to prepare a suitcase to return to London on the night express, and that the carriage should be in front of the door at half-past eight.</t5630> <t5631>He had decided not to spend another night at Selby Royal.</t5631> <t5632>It was a place of bad omens.</t5632> <t5633>Death roamed there in broad daylight.</t5633> <t5634>The forest grass had been stained with blood.</t5634>
<t5635>Then he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was returning to London to consult his doctor, and asking him to entertain his guests during his absence.</t5635> <t5636>As he was putting it into the envelope, he heard a knock at the door, and his valet informed him that the chief guard wanted to see him.</t5636>
<t5637>Dorian Gray frowned and bit his lips.</t5637> <t5638>"Tell him to come in," he murmured, after a brief hesitation.</t5638>
<t5639>As soon as his visitor entered, Dorian took a checkbook out of a drawer and opened it.</t5639>
<t5640>—I imagine, Thornton, that you have come to talk to me about the unfortunate accident this morning —he said, gripping the pen.</t5640>
<t5641>—That's right, sir —replied the forest ranger.</t5641>
<t5642>—Was that poor wretch married?</t5642> <t5643>Did he have dependents? —asked Dorian, with a bored air—.</t5643> <t5644>If so, I wouldn't want them to be in need, and I am willing to send them the amount you deem necessary.</t5644>
<t5645>—We don't know who it is, sir.</t5645> <t5646>That is what I have taken the liberty to come and tell you.</t5646>
<t5647>—Don't you know who he is? —asked Dorian distractedly—.</t5647> <t5648>What do you mean? Wasn't he one of your men?</t5648>
<t5649>—No, sir.</t5649> <t5650>I had never seen him before.</t5650> <t5651>He looks like a sailor, sir.</t5651>
<t5652>Dorian Gray dropped the pen from his hand and felt as if his heart had stopped beating.</t5652>
<t5653>—A sailor? —he exclaimed—.</t5653> <t5654>Did you say a sailor?</t5654> <t5655>—Yes, sir.</t5655> <t5656>It seems as if he had been a sailor or something similar; tattoos on both arms and other things like that.</t5656>
<t5657>—Did he have anything on him? —asked Dorian, leaning forward and looking at the gamekeeper with eyes full of shock—.</t5657> <t5658>Anything that would allow us to know his name?</t5658>
<t5659>—Some money, sir, not much, and a six-shot revolver.</t5659> <t5660>Nothing that identifies him.</t5660> <t5661>He looks like a decent person, without being a gentleman.</t5661> <t5662>Something like a sailor, we believe.</t5662>
<t5663>Dorian stood up.</t5663> <t5664>An impossible hope brushed him with its wing, and he clung to it frantically.</t5664>
<t5665>—Where is the corpse? —he exclaimed—.</t5665> <t5666>Quickly! I must see it as soon as possible.</t5666>
<t5667>—In an empty barn on the farm, sir.</t5667> <t5668>Nobody wants to have something like that in their house.</t5668> <t5669>They say a corpse brings bad luck.</t5669>
<t5670>—The farm!</t5670> <t5671>Go there immediately and wait for me.</t5671> <t5672>Tell one of the stable boys to bring me the horse.</t5672> <t5673>No.</t5673> <t5674>Don't worry.</t5674> <t5675>I'll go to the stable myself.</t5675> <t5676>We'll save time.</t5676>
<t5677>In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the grand avenue.</t5677> <t5678>The trees seemed to parade on either side like a procession of ghosts, and strange shadows furiously threw themselves in his path.</t5678> <t5679>On one occasion, the mare shied at a white post and nearly threw him off.</t5679> <t5680>Dorian struck her neck with the whip.</t5680> <t5681>The animal darted into the darkness like an arrow.</t5681> <t5682>Her hooves sent pebbles flying.</t5682>
<t5683>Finally, he arrived at the farm and found two idle men in the yard.</t5683> <t5684>Dorian jumped off the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.</t5684> <t5685>A light flickered in the farthest stable.</t5685> <t5686>Something told him that the corpse was there.</t5686> <t5687>He ran to the door and put his hand on the doorknob.</t5687>
<t5688>Then he paused for a moment, feeling that he was about to make a discovery that would either revive his life or destroy it.</t5688> <t5689>Next, he flung the door open and entered.</t5689>
<t5690>On a pile of empty sacks, and in the corner farthest from the door, lay the corpse of a man dressed in a coarse cloth shirt and blue trousers.</t5690> <t5691>A polka-dotted handkerchief had been placed over his face.</t5691> <t5692>A poor-quality candle, sunk into the neck of a bottle, sputtered beside him.</t5692>
<t5693>Dorian Gray shuddered.</t5693> <t5694>He felt that it could not be his hand that removed the handkerchief, and asked one of the laborers to come closer.</t5694>
<t5695>—Take off whatever is on his face.</t5695> <t5696>I want to see him —he said, holding onto the door jamb to avoid falling.</t5696>
<t5697>When the laborer did what they asked of him, Dorian Gray stepped forward.</t5697> <t5698>A cry of joy escaped from his lips.</t5698> <t5699>The dead man among the undergrowth was James Vane.</t5699>
<t5700>He remained there for a few minutes, contemplating the corpse.</t5700> <t5701>Then he returned to the main house with his eyes full of tears, knowing that he was safe.</t5701>
<t5702>Chapter 19</t5702>
<t5703>—Don't tell me you're going to be good —exclaimed Lord Henry, dipping his fingers into a red copper bowl filled with rose water—.</t5703> <t5704>You are absolutely perfect.</t5704> <t5705>Do me a favor and don't change.</t5705>
<t5706>Dorian Gray moved his head.</t5706>
<t5707>—No, Harry, no.</t5707> <t5708>I have done too many horrible things in my life.</t5708> <t5709>I am not going to do any more.</t5709> <t5710>Yesterday, I started with good deeds.</t5710>
<t5711>—Where were you yesterday?</t5711>
<t5712>—In the countryside, Harry.</t5712> <t5713>Alone, in a humble inn.</t5713> <t5714>—My dear boy —said Lord Henry, smiling—, anyone can be good in the countryside, where there are no temptations.</t5714> <t5715>That is why people who do not live in cities still live in a state of barbarism.</t5715> <t5716>Civilization is not something that is easily achieved.</t5716> <t5717>There are only two ways.</t5717> <t5718>Either one is cultured or one is corrupt.</t5718> <t5719>Country people lack opportunities for both, so they only know stagnation.</t5719> <t5720>-Culture and corruption —repeated Dorian—.</t5720> <t5721>I know something about those two things.</t5721> <t5722>Now it seems terrible to me that they ever go together.</t5722> <t5723>Because I have a new ideal, Harry.</t5723> <t5724>I am going to change.</t5724> <t5725>I think I have already changed.</t5725>
<t5726>—You haven't told me what your good deed was yesterday.</t5726> <t5727>Or was it more than one? —asked his interlocutor, while pouring a small crimson pyramid of ripe strawberries onto his plate, then whitening them with sugar using a perforated spoon shaped like a shell.</t5727>
<t5728>—I can tell you, Harry, though no one else.</t5728> <t5729>I gave up harming a person.</t5729> <t5730>It seems pretentious, but you understand what I mean.</t5730> <t5731>She was very beautiful, and extraordinarily similar to Sibyl Vane.</t5731> <t5732>I think that was the first thing that attracted me to her.</t5732> <t5733>You remember Sibyl, don't you?</t5733> <t5734>How much time seems to have passed!</t5734> <t5735>Hetty, of course, is not someone of our standing, just a village girl.</t5735> <t5736>But I had fallen in love.</t5736> <t5737>I am completely sure that I loved her.</t5737> <t5738>During this wonderful month of May that we have enjoyed, I went to see her two or three times a week.</t5738> <t5739>Yesterday she met me in an orchard.</t5739> <t5740>The apple blossoms were falling on her hair and she laughed a lot.</t5740> <t5741>We were going to run away together this morning at dawn.</t5741> <t5742>Suddenly, I decided that she shouldn't change because of me.</t5742>
<t5743>—I imagine that the novelty of that feeling must have given you a genuine thrill of pleasure —interrupted Lord Henry—.</t5743> <t5744>But I am in a position to tell you the end of your idyll.</t5744> <t5745>You gave her good advice and broke her heart.</t5745> <t5746>That has been the beginning of your amendment.</t5746>
<t5747>—How unpleasant you are, Harry!</t5747> <t5748>You shouldn't say such dreadful things.</t5748> <t5749>Hetty's heart hasn't been broken.</t5749> <t5750>She cried, of course, and all that.</t5750> <t5751>But she hasn't lost her honor.</t5751> <t5752>She can live, like Perdita[18], in her garden of mint and marigolds.</t5752>
<t5753>—And cry over the infidelity of Florisel —said Lord Henry, laughing, as he leaned back in his chair—.</t5753> <t5754>My dear Dorian, you have curious adolescent ideas.</t5754> <t5755>Do you really think that girl will now be content with someone of her own station?</t5755> <t5756>I imagine that someday she will be married off to a foul-mouthed carter or a humorous farmer.</t5756> <t5757>And the fact that she has known you, and loved you, will allow her to despise her husband, which will make her perfectly miserable.</t5757> <t5758>From a moral standpoint, I can't say that your great renunciation impresses me much.</t5758> <t5759>Even as a modest beginning, it is very little.</t5759> <t5760>Besides, who is to say that at this moment Hetty is not floating in some star-lit pond surrounded by lilies, like Ophelia?</t5760>
<t5761>—You are unbearable, Harry!</t5761> <t5762>You mock everything and then imagine the most dreadful tragedies.</t5762> <t5763>I'm sorry I told you about it.</t5763> <t5764>I don't care what you say.</t5764> <t5765>I know I have acted rightly.</t5765> <t5766>Poor Hetty!</t5766> <t5767>When I rode past her farm this morning, I saw her face at the window, like a bouquet of jasmine.</t5767> <t5768>Let's not talk about it anymore, and don't try to convince me that my first good deed in many years, my first attempt at self-sacrifice in my entire life, is actually just another sin.</t5768> <t5769>I want to be better.</t5769> <t5770>I'm going to be better.</t5770> <t5771>Tell me something about yourself.</t5771> <t5772>What's happening in London?</t5772> <t5773>It's been days since I went to the club.</t5773>
<t5774>—People are still talking about the disappearance of poor Basil.</t5774>
<t5775>—I thought they would have gotten tired after so much time —exclaimed Dorian, pouring himself a bit more wine and slightly furrowing his brow.</t5775>
<t5776>—My dear boy, they've only been talking about it for six weeks, and the British public needs three months to endure the mental strain that a change of topic requires.</t5776> <t5777>Anyway, he has been quite lucky in recent times.</t5777> <t5778>First, there was my divorce case and Alan Campbell's suicide.</t5778> <t5779>Now they are offered the mysterious disappearance of an artist.</t5779> <t5780>Scotland Yard continues to insist that the person in a gray coat who took the midnight train to France on November ninth was poor Basil, and the French police claim that Hallward never arrived in Paris.</t5780> <t5781>I suppose that in a couple of weeks we will be told that he has been seen in San Francisco.</t5781> <t5782>It's a strange thing, but of all the people who disappear, it always ends up being said that they have been seen in San Francisco.</t5782> <t5783>It must be a charming city, and it possesses all the attractions of the world to come.</t5783>
<t5784>—What do you think has happened to Basil? —asked Dorian, holding the glass of burgundy up to the light, and wondering how it was possible for him to speak about the matter so calmly.</t5784>
<t5785>—I don't have the slightest idea.</t5785> <t5786>If Basil decides to hide, it's none of my business.</t5786> <t5787>If he is dead, I don't want to think about him.</t5787> <t5788>Death is the only thing that truly terrifies me.</t5788> <t5789>I abhor it.</t5789>
<t5790>—Why? —asked the youngest one in a tired tone.</t5790>
<t5791>—Because —responded Lord Henry, bringing a golden vinaigrette to his nose and inhaling the scent— nowadays one can survive everything, except that.</t5791> <t5792>Death and vulgarity are the two facts of the 19th century that lack explanation.</t5792> <t5793>We will have coffee in the music room, Dorian.</t5793> <t5794>You must play Chopin in my honor.</t5794> <t5795>The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin in a truly exquisite manner.</t5795> <t5796>Poor Victoria!</t5796> <t5797>I was very fond of her.</t5797> <t5798>The house has become very lonely without her.</t5798> <t5799>Of course, married life is nothing but a habit, a bad habit.</t5799> <t5800>But the truth is that we regret the loss even of our worst habits.</t5800> <t5801>Perhaps they are the ones we regret the most.</t5801> <t5802>They are too essential a part of our personality.</t5802>
<t5803>Dorian said nothing, but he got up from the table and, moving to the adjacent room, sat at the piano and let his fingers wander over the black and white ivory of the keys.</t5803> <t5804>When they brought the coffee, he stopped playing and, turning to Lord Henry, said:</t5804>
<t5805>—Harry, has it ever occurred to you that perhaps Basil Hallward was murdered?</t5805>
<t5806>Lord Henry yawned.</t5806>
<t5807>—Basil was very popular, and he always wore a Waterbury watch[19].</t5807> <t5808>Why would anyone have wanted to murder him?</t5808> <t5809>He wasn't smart enough to make enemies.</t5809> <t5810>It's true that he had great talent for painting.</t5810> <t5811>But a person can paint like Velázquez and still be perfectly boring.</t5811> <t5812>Basil was.</t5812> <t5813>He only interested me once, and that was when he told me, years ago, that he adored you madly, and that you were the dominant motive of his art.</t5813>
<t5814>—I was very fond of him —said Dorian with a note of sadness in his voice—.</t5814> <t5815>But, don't people say that he was murdered?</t5815>
<t5816>—Some newspapers say so, but it doesn't seem likely to me at all.</t5816> <t5817>I know there are terrible places in Paris, but Basil wasn't the type of person who goes to those places.</t5817> <t5818>He wasn't curious.</t5818> <t5819>That was his main flaw.</t5819>
<t5820>—What would you say, Harry, if I confessed that I had murdered Basil? —said the younger man.</t5820> <t5821>Then he stared at him intently.</t5821>
<t5822>—I would say, my dear friend, that you are trying to play a role that does not suit you at all.</t5822> <t5823>Every crime is vulgar, just as everything vulgar is a crime.</t5823> <t5824>It is not in your nature, Dorian, to commit a murder.</t5824> <t5825>I regret hurting your vanity by saying this, but I assure you it is true.</t5825> <t5826>Crime belongs exclusively to the lower classes.</t5826> <t5827>I do not blame them in the slightest.</t5827> <t5828>I imagine that for them it is like art is for us, a way to procure extraordinary sensations.</t5828>
<t5829>—A way to procure sensations?</t5829> <t5830>Do you think, then, that a person who has once committed a murder could relapse into the same crime?</t5830> <t5831>Don't tell me that's true.</t5831>
<t5832>—Anything becomes a pleasure if done often enough —exclaimed Lord Henry, laughing—.</t5832> <t5833>That is one of the most important secrets of life.</t5833> <t5834>But it seems to me, anyway, that murder is always a mistake.</t5834> <t5835>One should never do anything that cannot be talked about after dinner.</t5835> <t5836>But let's forget about poor Basil.</t5836> <t5837>I would like to believe that he ended in as romantic a way as you suggest, but I can't.</t5837> <t5838>My opinion, rather, is that he fell into the Seine from the top of a bus, and the driver covered it up to avoid scandal.</t5838> <t5839>Yes; I imagine that's how it ended.</t5839> <t5840>I see him lying on his back under those matte green waters with heavy barges passing over him and seaweed tangled in his hair.</t5840> <t5841>You know?</t5841> <t5842>I don't think he would have done anything worthwhile in the future.</t5842> <t5843>For the last ten years, his painting had declined a lot.</t5843>
<t5844>Dorian let out a sigh, and Lord Henry crossed the room and began to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large bird with gray plumage, red crest and tail, which balanced itself on a bamboo perch.</t5844> <t5845>When touched by those sharp fingers, it let the white foam of its wrinkled eyelids fall over eyes resembling black crystals, and began to sway.</t5845>
<t5846>—Yes —continued Lord Henry, turning around and taking a handkerchief out of his pocket—, he was painting worse and worse.</t5846> <t5847>It was as if he had lost something.</t5847> <t5848>Probably an ideal.</t5848> <t5849>When you stopped being great friends, Basil stopped being a great artist.</t5849> <t5850>What was it that separated you?</t5850> <t5851>I imagine he bored you immensely.</t5851> <t5852>If so, he never forgave you for it.</t5852> <t5853>It's a habit that boring people have.</t5853> <t5854>By the way, what happened to that wonderful portrait he made of you?</t5854> <t5855>I don't think I've seen it again since he finished it.</t5855> <t5856>Oh, yes!</t5856> <t5857>Years ago you told me, now I remember, that you had sent it to Selby and that it was lost or stolen along the way.</t5857> <t5858>Did you never recover it?</t5858> <t5859>What a pity!</t5859> <t5860>It was truly a masterpiece.</t5860> <t5861>I remember I wanted to buy it.</t5861> <t5862>I wish I had done so.</t5862> <t5863>It belonged to Basil's best period.</t5863> <t5864>Since then, his work has had that curious mix of bad painting and good intentions that always gives one the right to say someone is a representative British artist.</t5864> <t5865>Didn't you publish ads to try to recover it?</t5865> <t5866>You should have done so.</t5866>
<t5867>—I don't remember —said Dorian—.</t5867> <t5868>I suppose I did.</t5868> <t5869>But the truth is that I never really liked it.</t5869> <t5870>I'm sorry I posed for him.</t5870> <t5871>His memory is odious to me.</t5871> <t5872>Why do you talk about that portrait?</t5872> <t5873>It always reminded me of those curious verses from some play, I think Hamlet... how do they go, exactly?</t5873>
<t5874>Or are you like an image of sorrow,</t5874>
<t5875>like a face without a soul?</t5875>
<t5876>Yes: that is what it was.</t5876>
<t5877>Lord Henry burst out laughing.</t5877>
<t5878>—If a person treats life artistically, their brain is their soul —he replied, sinking into an armchair.</t5878> <t5879>Dorian Gray shook his head and drew some melancholy chords from the piano.</t5879>
<t5880>—"Image of pain" —he repeated—, "soulless face."</t5880>
<t5881>His older friend reclined in the armchair and gazed at him with half-closed eyes.</t5881>
<t5882>—By the way, Dorian —he said, after a pause—, "What does it profit a man"..., how exactly does the quote end?, "to gain the whole world and lose his own soul[20]?"</t5882>
<t5883>The piano let out a discordant note and Dorian Gray, startled, turned to look at Lord Henry.</t5883> <t5884>—Why do you ask me that, Harry?</t5884>
<t5885>—My dear friend —said Lord Henry, raising his eyebrows in a gesture of surprise—, I asked you because I thought you capable of giving me an answer.</t5885> <t5886>That's all.</t5886> <t5887>When I was walking through the Park this past Sunday, I came across, near Marble Arch, a small group of poorly dressed people listening to a vulgar street preacher.</t5887> <t5888>As I was passing by, I heard that man shouting that question to his audience.</t5888> <t5889>It all seemed quite dramatic to me.</t5889> <t5890>London abounds with curious effects like that.</t5890> <t5891>A rainy Sunday, a vulgar Christian in a raincoat, a circle of pale sickly faces under an uneven roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase thrown into the air by hysterical lips and a shrill voice... it was quite good, in its own way: quite suggestive.</t5891> <t5892>It occurred to me to tell the prophet that Art does have a soul, but not the human being.</t5892> <t5893>I'm very much afraid, however, that he wouldn't have understood me.</t5893>
<t5894>—Don't say that, Harry.</t5894> <t5895>The soul is a terrible reality.</t5895> <t5896>It can be bought and sold, and even traded.</t5896> <t5897>It can be poisoned or perfected.</t5897> <t5898>Each and every one of us has a soul.</t5898> <t5899>I know it very well.</t5899>
<t5900>—Are you sure, Dorian?</t5900>
<t5901>—Completely sure.</t5901>
<t5902>—Ah! then it must be an illusion.</t5902> <t5903>The things one is completely sure of are never true.</t5903> <t5904>That is the fatality of faith and the lesson of romanticism.</t5904> <t5905>What a solemn air!</t5905> <t5906>Don't get so serious.</t5906> <t5907>What do you and I have to do with the superstitions of our time?</t5907> <t5908>No; we have renounced believing in the soul.</t5908> <t5909>Play a nocturne for me, Dorian, and while you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have managed to keep your youth.</t5909> <t5910>You must have some secret.</t5910> <t5911>I'm only ten years older than you, but I have wrinkles and I'm worn and yellow.</t5911> <t5912>You are truly admirable, Dorian.</t5912> <t5913>You have never seemed so charming to me as tonight.</t5913> <t5914>You make me remember the day I met you.</t5914> <t5915>You were quite impertinent, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.</t5915> <t5916>You have changed, of course, but your appearance has not.</t5916> <t5917>I would like you to tell me your secret.</t5917> <t5918>I would do anything to regain youth, except exercise, get up early, or be respectable... Youth!</t5918> <t5919>There is nothing like youth.</t5919> <t5920>It is absurd to talk about the ignorance of youth.</t5920> <t5921>The only people whose opinions I listen to with respect are those much younger than me.</t5921> <t5922>They seem to be ahead of me.</t5922> <t5923>Life has revealed its latest wonders to them.</t5923> <t5924>As for older people, I always contradict them.</t5924> <t5925>I do it on principle.</t5925> <t5926>If you ask their opinion about something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions that were current in 1820, when people wore high stockings, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing.</t5926> <t5927>How beautiful is that which you are playing!</t5927> <t5928>I wonder if Chopin wrote it in Mallorca, with the sea crying around the villa where he lived, and with drops of salt water hitting the windows.</t5928> <t5929>Wonderfully romantic!</t5929> <t5930>It is a blessing that we still have a non-imitative art!</t5930> <t5931>Don't stop.</t5931> <t5932>Tonight I need music.</t5932> <t5933>You seem to me like young Apollo, and I am Marsyas, listening to you.</t5933> <t5934>I have my own sufferings, Dorian, of which even you are unaware.</t5934> <t5935>The tragedy of old age is not being old, but young.</t5935> <t5936>Sometimes my own sincerity surprises me.</t5936> <t5937>Ah, Dorian, how happy you are!</t5937> <t5938>What an exquisite life you have!</t5938> <t5939>You have drunk your fill of all pleasures.</t5939> <t5940>You have tasted the ripest grapes.</t5940> <t5941>Nothing has been hidden from you.</t5941> <t5942>And all of it has been nothing more to you than a few musical bars.</t5942> <t5943>Nothing has spoiled you.</t5943> <t5944>You remain the same.</t5944>
<t5945>—I'm not the same, Harry.</t5945>
<t5946>—Yes, you are.</t5946> <t5947>I wonder what the rest of your life will be like.</t5947> <t5948>Don't ruin it with renunciations.</t5948> <t5949>At the present moment, you are perfection itself.</t5949> <t5950>Don't make yourself voluntarily incomplete.</t5950> <t5951>You lack nothing.</t5951> <t5952>Don't shake your head: you know it's true.</t5952> <t5953>Moreover, Dorian, don't deceive yourself.</t5953> <t5954>Life is not governed by will or intention.</t5954> <t5955>Life is a matter of nerves, of fibers, and of slowly elaborated cells in which thought hides and passion has its dreams.</t5955> <t5956>You might imagine that you are safe and believe that you are strong.</t5956> <t5957>But a casual change of color in a room or in the morning sky, a certain perfume that you liked once and that brings back subtle memories, a verse from a forgotten poem that you stumble upon again, a cadence from a musical composition that you have stopped playing...</t5957> <t5958>I assure you, Dorian, that life depends on things like those.</t5958> <t5959>Browning writes about it somewhere, but our own senses invent it for us.</t5959> <t5960>There are moments when the smell of white lilacs suddenly overpowers me, and I have to relive the strangest month of my life.</t5960> <t5961>I would gladly change places with you, Dorian.</t5961> <t5962>The world never tires of denouncing us both, but it has always worshipped you.</t5962> <t5963>And it always will.</t5963> <t5964>You are the prototype of what this era of ours seeks and fears it has found.</t5964> <t5965>I am so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, nor painted a picture, nor produced anything other than yourself!</t5965> <t5966>Life has been your art.</t5966> <t5967>You have made music of yourself.</t5967> <t5968>Your days are your sonnets.</t5968>
<t5969>Dorian got up from the piano and ran his hand through his hair.</t5969>
<t5970>—Yes; life has given me exquisite pleasures —he murmured—, but I am going to change, Harry.</t5970> <t5971>And you must not give me such excessive praise.</t5971> <t5972>You don't know everything.</t5972> <t5973>I think that if you knew, you too would distance yourself from me.</t5973> <t5974>You laugh.</t5974> <t5975>You shouldn't do that.</t5975>
<t5976>—Why did you stop playing, Dorian?</t5976> <t5977>Go back to the piano and delight me again with that nocturne.</t5977> <t5978>Look at the enormous honey-colored moon hanging in the darkness.</t5978> <t5979>It is waiting for you to enchant it, and if you play, it will come closer to the earth.</t5979> <t5980>Don't you want to?</t5980> <t5981>Then let's go to the club.</t5981> <t5982>It has been a delightful evening and we should end it in the same manner.</t5982> <t5983>There is someone at the White who has an immense desire to meet you: it's young Lord Poole, the eldest son of Bournemouth.</t5983> <t5984>He has already copied your ties, and now he begs me to introduce you to him.</t5984> <t5985>He is a charming boy and reminds me a lot of you.</t5985>
<t5986>—I hope not —said Dorian, with a sad expression in his eyes—.</t5986> <t5987>The truth is that tonight I'm tired, Harry.</t5987> <t5988>I'm not going to the club.</t5988> <t5989>It's almost eleven and I want to go to bed early.</t5989>
<t5990>—Stay, please.</t5990> <t5991>You have never played as well as you did tonight.</t5991> <t5992>There was something wonderful about your style.</t5992> <t5993>It was more expressive than ever.</t5993>
<t5994>—That is because I am going to be good —he replied, smiling—.</t5994> <t5995>I have already changed a bit.</t5995>
<t5996>—You cannot change for me —said Lord Henry—.</t5996> <t5997>You and I will always be friends.</t5997>
<t5998>—On one occasion, however, you poisoned me with a book.</t5998> <t5999>I will not forget that.</t5999> <t6000>Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to anyone.</t6000> <t6001>It causes harm.</t6001>
<t6002>—My dear boy, it is true that you are beginning to moralize.</t6002> <t6003>Very soon you will go around like converts and evangelists, warning people against all the sins you have grown tired of.</t6003> <t6004>You are too charming to do such a thing.</t6004> <t6005>Besides, it is useless.</t6005> <t6006>You and I are what we are, and we will be what we will be.</t6006> <t6007>As for being poisoned by a book, no such thing exists.</t6007> <t6008>Art has no influence over action.</t6008> <t6009>It annihilates the desire to act.</t6009> <t6010>It is magnificently sterile.</t6010> <t6011>The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.</t6011> <t6012>That is all.</t6012> <t6013>But let's not argue about literature.</t6013> <t6014>Come see me tomorrow.</t6014> <t6015>I will go horseback riding at eleven.</t6015> <t6016>We can do it together and then I'll take you to lunch with Lady Branksome.</t6016> <t6017>She is a charming woman, and she wants to consult you about certain tapestries she is thinking of buying.</t6017> <t6018>Don't forget to come.</t6018> <t6019>Or do you think it's better if we have lunch with our little duchess?</t6019> <t6020>She says she never sees you anymore.</t6020> <t6021>Have you grown tired of Gladys?</t6021> <t6022>I thought it would eventually happen to you.</t6022> <t6023>That clever tongue of hers ends up exasperating anyone.</t6023> <t6024>Anyway, make sure to be here at eleven.</t6024>
<t6025>—Is it necessary for me to come, Harry?</t6025>
<t6026>—Of course.</t6026> <t6027>Now the Park is wonderful.</t6027> <t6028>I don't think there have ever been such beautiful lilacs since the year I met you.</t6028>
<t6029>—Very well.</t6029> <t6030>I will be here at eleven —said Dorian—.</t6030> <t6031>Good night, Harry.</t6031>
<t6032>Upon reaching the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had something more to say.</t6032> <t6033>Then he let out a sigh and left the room.</t6033>
<t6034>Chapter 20</t6034>
<t6035>The night air was a delight, so warm that Dorian Gray draped his coat over his arm and didn't even tie the silk scarf around his neck.</t6035><t6036>As he headed home, smoking a cigarette, two young men in formal attire crossed paths with him, and he heard one whisper to the other, "That's Dorian Gray."</t6036><t6037>He remembered how much he used to enjoy being pointed at or stared at and talked about.</t6037><t6038>Now he was tired of hearing his name.</t6038><t6039>A large part of the charm of the little village he had been visiting so frequently lately was that no one knew him.</t6039><t6040>To the girl he courted until she fell in love with him, he had said he was poor, and Hetty had believed him.</t6040><t6041>On another occasion, he told her he was a wicked person, and she laughed, replying that the wicked were always very old and very ugly.</t6041><t6042>Ah, her way of laughing!</t6042><t6043>It was like the song of the lark.</t6043><t6044>And how pretty she looked in her cotton dresses and wide-brimmed hats!</t6044><t6045>Hetty knew nothing at all, but she possessed everything he had lost.</t6045>
<t6046>Upon arriving at his house, he found the valet waiting for him.</t6046> <t6047>He told him to go to bed, dropped onto a sofa in the library, and began to think about the things Lord Henry had told him.</t6047>
<t6048>Was it really true that one does not change?</t6048> <t6049>He felt a mad desire to regain the spotless purity of his adolescence; his pink and white adolescence, as Lord Henry had once called it.</t6049> <t6050>He knew that he was stained, that he had filled his spirit with corruption and fed his imagination with horrors; that he had exerted a harmful influence on others, and that he had experienced, in doing so, an indescribable joy; and that, of all the lives that had crossed paths with his, he had plunged precisely the most beautiful, the most promising ones into dishonor.</t6050> <t6051>But, was all that irremediable? Did he have no hope left?</t6051>
<t6052>Oh, in what monstrous moment of pride and blindness had he prayed for the portrait to bear the burden of his days and for him to retain the eternally intact splendor of youth!</t6052> <t6053>His failure stemmed from there.</t6053> <t6054>It would have been much better for him if each sin committed had been accompanied by its inevitable and immediate punishment.</t6054> <t6055>Instead of "forgive us our sins," the prayer of men to a God of justice should be "punish us for our iniquities."</t6055>
<t6056>The curious carved mirror that Lord Henry had given him so many years ago was on the table, and the ivory-limbed cupids were still, as before, surrounding it with their laughter.</t6056> <t6057>He picked it up, as he had done on that night of horror, when he first noticed a change in the fatal portrait, and with eyes wide open, clouded by tears, he gazed at its polished surface.</t6057> <t6058>On one occasion, someone who had loved him passionately wrote him a letter that concluded with this declaration of idolatry: "The world has changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curve of your lips rewrites history."</t6058> <t6059>Those phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over again.</t6059> <t6060>Then his beauty inspired in him an infinite disgust, and, throwing the mirror to the ground, he crushed it with his heel until it was reduced to silver splinters.</t6060> <t6061>His beauty had ruined him, his beauty and the youth for which he had prayed.</t6061> <t6062>Without either, perhaps his life would have remained unstained.</t6062> <t6063>Beauty had only been a mask, and his youth, a mockery.</t6063> <t6064>What was youth at best?</t6064> <t6065>A time of inexperience, of immaturity, a time of fleeting moods and morbid thoughts.</t6065> <t6066>Why had he insisted on wearing its uniform?</t6066> <t6067>Youth had ruined him.</t6067>
<t6068>It was better not to think about the past.</t6068> <t6069>Nothing could change it.</t6069> <t6070>He had to think about himself, about his future.</t6070> <t6071>James Vane had been buried in an anonymous grave in the Selby cemetery.</t6071> <t6072>Alan Campbell had committed suicide one night in his laboratory, but without revealing the secret that had been imposed on him.</t6072> <t6073>The emotion, or curiosity, aroused by the disappearance of Basil Hallward would soon fade away.</t6073> <t6074>It was already starting to happen.</t6074> <t6075>In that regard, he had nothing to fear.</t6075> <t6076>And, in fact, it was not Basil Hallward's death that overwhelmed him the most.</t6076> <t6077>He was obsessed with the living death of his own soul.</t6077> <t6078>Basil had painted the portrait that ruined his life.</t6078> <t6079>He could not forgive him for that.</t6079> <t6080>The portrait was to blame for everything.</t6080> <t6081>Basil had said intolerable things to him, which he, however, endured with patience.</t6081> <t6082>The murder was simply the work of a momentary madness.</t6082> <t6083>As for Alan Campbell, the suicide had been his personal decision.</t6083> <t6084>He had chosen to act that way.</t6084> <t6085>It had nothing to do with him.</t6085>
<t6086>A new life!</t6086> <t6087>That was what I needed.</t6087> <t6088>That was what I was waiting for.</t6088> <t6089>Without a doubt, I had already started it.</t6089> <t6090>I had avoided, at least, the ruin of an innocent creature.</t6090> <t6091>I would never again place temptation in the path of innocence.</t6091> <t6092>I would be good.</t6092>
<t6093>When thinking about Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait had changed.</t6093> <t6094>Surely it would no longer be as horrible as before.</t6094> <t6095>Perhaps, if his life regained its purity, it would expel from his face every last trace of evil passions.</t6095> <t6096>Perhaps, even, they had already disappeared.</t6096> <t6097>He would go see it.</t6097>
<t6098>He took the lamp and stealthily went up the stairs.</t6098> <t6099>As he drew back the bolt, a smile of joy illuminated his strangely young face for an instant and lingered a few moments more around his lips.</t6099> <t6100>Yes, he would do good, and that dreadful portrait that had been hidden for so long would cease to terrify him.</t6100> <t6101>He felt as if a weight had already been lifted from his shoulders.</t6101>
<t6102>He entered without making the slightest noise, locking the door again as was his custom, and removed the purple cloth that covered the painting.</t6102> <t6103>A cry of pain and indignation escaped his lips.</t6103> <t6104>There was no noticeable change, except for a gleam of cunning in the eyes and the sinuous wrinkles of hypocrisy around the mouth.</t6104> <t6105>The canvas was as hateful as ever, even more so, if that were possible; and the scarlet dew that stained the hand seemed brighter, more like freshly spilled blood.</t6105> <t6106>Dorian Gray then began to tremble.</t6106> <t6107>Had vanity alone driven him to carry out his only good deed?</t6107> <t6108>Or had it been the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had suggested with his mocking laugh?</t6108> <t6109>Or perhaps the passionate desire to play a role that pushes us to do better things than we are naturally inclined to? Or maybe all of it at once?</t6109> <t6110>But why was the red stain larger?</t6110> <t6111>It seemed to have spread like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.</t6111> <t6112>There was blood on the painted feet, as if that thing had dripped..., blood even on the hand that had not wielded the knife.</t6112> <t6113>A confession?</t6113> <t6114>Did that mean he was going to confess his crime?</t6114> <t6115>That he was going to turn himself in to be executed?</t6115> <t6116>He laughed.</t6116> <t6117>The idea seemed monstrous to him.</t6117> <t6118>Besides, even if he confessed, who would believe him?</t6118> <t6119>There was no trace anywhere of the murdered painter.</t6119> <t6120>All his belongings had been destroyed.</t6120> <t6121>He himself had burned the suitcase and coat.</t6121> <t6122>The world would simply say he was crazy.</t6122> <t6123>They would lock him up in an asylum if he insisted on repeating the same story...</t6123> <t6124>However, it was his duty to confess, to publicly endure the shame and expiate the guilt in an equally public manner.</t6124> <t6125>There was a God who demanded that humans confess their sins on earth as well as in heaven.</t6125> <t6126>Nothing he did would purify him if he didn't confess his sin.</t6126> <t6127>His sin?</t6127> <t6128>He shrugged.</t6128> <t6129>The death of Basil Hallward seemed very insignificant to him.</t6129> <t6130>He thought of Hetty Merton.</t6130> <t6131>Because that mirror of his soul he was gazing at was an unjust mirror.</t6131> <t6132>Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Was there nothing more than that in his renunciation?</t6132> <t6133>There had been something more.</t6133> <t6134>At least that's what he believed.</t6134> <t6135>But how to know...?</t6135> <t6136>No.</t6136> <t6137>There was nothing more.</t6137> <t6138>He had only renounced the girl out of vanity.</t6138> <t6139>Hypocrisy had led him to don the mask of goodness.</t6139> <t6140>He had practiced self-denial out of curiosity.</t6140> <t6141>Now he acknowledged it.</t6141>
<t6142>But that murder..., was it going to haunt him all his life?</t6142> <t6143>Would he always have to bear the weight of his past?</t6143>
<t6144>Should he confess? Never.</t6144> <t6145>There was only one piece of evidence against him.</t6145> <t6146>The painting itself: that was the evidence.</t6146> <t6147>He would destroy it.</t6147> <t6148>Why had he kept it for so long?</t6148> <t6149>Years ago, it gave him the pleasure of watching it change and grow old.</t6149> <t6150>In recent times, that pleasure had disappeared.</t6150> <t6151>The painting kept him from sleeping.</t6151> <t6152>When he traveled, he was horrified at the possibility of others seeing it.</t6152> <t6153>It tinged his passions with melancholy.</t6153> <t6154>Its mere memory spoiled many moments of joy.</t6154> <t6155>It had been something like his conscience.</t6155> <t6156>Yes.</t6156> <t6157>It had been his conscience.</t6157> <t6158>He would destroy it.</t6158>
<t6159>He looked around and saw the knife with which he had stabbed Basil Hallward.</t6159> <t6160>He had cleaned it many times, until all the stains disappeared.</t6160> <t6161>It shone, it sparkled.</t6161> <t6162>In the same way he had killed the painter, he would kill his work and everything it meant.</t6162> <t6163>He would kill the past and, when it was dead, he would regain his freedom.</t6163> <t6164>He would end that monstrous life of the soul and, without its hateful warnings, he would regain peace.</t6164> <t6165>He wielded the weapon and with it stabbed the portrait.</t6165>
<t6166>A scream was heard and the sound of a fall.</t6166> <t6167>The scream revealed such dreadful suffering that the servants woke up frightened and quietly left their rooms.</t6167> <t6168>Two gentlemen who were passing through the square stopped and looked up at the large house.</t6168> <t6169>Then they continued walking until they found a policeman and returned with him.</t6169> <t6170>They rang the bell several times, but received no response.</t6170> <t6171>Except for a light on one of the balconies of the upper floor, everything was dark.</t6171> <t6172>After a while, the policeman moved to a neighboring doorway to observe the building from there.</t6172>
<t6173>—Who lives in that house? —the older gentleman asked him.</t6173>
<t6174>—Mr. Dorian Gray—replied the policeman.</t6174>
<t6175>The two people who were listening to him exchanged a knowing glance and, as they walked away, there was a sneer of contempt on their faces.</t6175> <t6176>One of them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.</t6176>
<t6177>Inside the house, in the area where the servants lived, the half-dressed servants spoke in low voices.</t6177> <t6178>The elderly Mrs. Leaf cried and wrung her hands.</t6178> <t6179>Francis was as pale as a dead man.</t6179>
<t6180>After approximately a quarter of an hour had passed, the valet took the coachman and one of the footmen with him and silently went up the stairs.</t6180> <t6181>The knocks on the door received no response.</t6181> <t6182>And everything remained silent when they called out to their master aloud.</t6182> <t6183>Finally, after trying in vain to force the door, they went out onto the roof and descended to the balcony.</t6183> <t6184>Once there, they entered without difficulty: the bolts were very old.</t6184>
<t6185>Inside they found, hanging on the wall, a splendid portrait of their lord as they had last seen him, in all the splendor of his youth and singular beauty.</t6185> <t6186>On the floor, dressed in formal attire, and with a knife stuck in his heart, they found the corpse of an older man, very emaciated, full of wrinkles, and with a repugnant face.</t6186> <t6187>They only recognized him when they examined the rings he wore on his fingers.</t6187>
