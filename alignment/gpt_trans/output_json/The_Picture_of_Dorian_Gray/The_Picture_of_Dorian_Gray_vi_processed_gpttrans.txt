<t0>Chapter 1</t0>
<t1>The studio was filled with the fragrance of roses, and when the gentle summer breeze stirred among the trees in the garden, the scent of lilacs wafted through the open door, mingling with the more delicate aroma of blooming wild peach blossoms.</t1>
<t2>From the corner of the Persian camel saddlebag-patterned divan on which he habitually lay smoking countless cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could only faintly see the honey-sweet and honey-colored blossoms of a laburnum tree whose trembling branches seemed to struggle under the weight of such a blazing beauty; and occasionally, the strange shadows of birds in flight would flicker across the long tussore silk curtains drawn before the wide window, evoking a sensation somewhat akin to a fleeting Japanese impression, and making him think of the green-faced, yellow-fanged artists in Tokyo, who, through the medium of an inherently static art, had attempted to convey a sense of swiftness and movement.</t2><t3>The mournful hum of bees threading through the long, uncut grass, or circling with monotonous persistence around the golden-tipped horns of the overgrown honeysuckle, seemed to make the stillness even more oppressive.</t3><t4>The distant roar of London was like the pedal note of a far-off organ.</t4>
<t5>In the middle of the room, clamped tightly onto an upright easel, was a full-length portrait of a young man with extraordinary personal beauty, and sitting in front of it, a little further away, was the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance a few years ago had caused, at that time, an overwhelming public sensation and generated a myriad of strange speculations.</t5>
<t6>As the artist gazed at the elegant and beautiful figure that he had skillfully captured with his art, a contented smile briefly crossed his face and seemed about to linger there.</t6> <t7>But he suddenly stood up and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers on his eyelids, as if trying to imprison in his mind a strange dream from which he feared he might awaken.</t7>
<t8>"That is your most beautiful work, Basil, the most beautiful thing you have ever created," Lord Henry said languidly.</t8> <t9>"Next year you must certainly send it to the Grosvenor.</t9> <t10>The Academy is too large and too vulgar.</t10> <t11>Every time I go there, it is either so crowded that I cannot see the paintings, which are dreadful, or there are so many paintings that I cannot see the people, which is even worse.</t11> <t12>The Grosvenor is really the only place."</t12>
<t13>“I don't think I'll send it anywhere,” he replied, tossing his head back in that peculiar way that often made his friends laugh at him in Oxford.</t13> <t14>“No: I won't send it anywhere.</t14><t15>”</t15>
<t16>Lord Henry raised an eyebrow and looked at him in astonishment through the thin blue smoke curling into surreal spirals from his opium-laden cigarette.</t16> <t17>“Not sending it anywhere?</t17> <t18>My friend, why?</t18> <t19>Do you have any reason?</t19> <t20>You artists are truly peculiar creatures!</t20> <t21>You do everything in the world to gain fame.</t21> <t22>Yet the moment you have it, it seems you want to throw it away.</t22> <t23>That is your folly, for there is only one thing in this world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.</t23> <t24>A portrait like this would place you above all the young men in England, and make the old ones seethe with envy, if those old men are still capable of feeling any emotion.”</t24>
<t25>“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really can't display it.</t25> <t26>I've put too much of myself into it already.”</t26>
<t27>Lord Henry stretched out on the couch and laughed.</t27>
<t28>“Yes, I know you will; but nevertheless, it is entirely true.”</t28>
<t29>“Too much of yourself in it!</t29> <t30>It’s really odd, Basil, I didn’t know you were so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he were made out of ivory and rose leaves.</t30> <t31>Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you — oh, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that.</t31> <t32>But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins.</t32> <t33>Intellect in itself is a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.</t33> <t34>The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid.</t34> <t35>Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.</t35> <t36>How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church.</t36> <t37>But then in the Church they don’t think.</t37> <t38>A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence, he always looks absolutely delightful.</t38> <t39>Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.</t39> <t40>I am quite sure of that.</t40> <t41>He is some brainless, beautiful creature, who should always be here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.</t41> <t42>Don’t flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him.”</t42>
<t43>“You don't understand me, Harry,” the artist replied.</t43> <t44>“Of course, I am not like him.</t44> <t45>I know that very well.</t45> <t46>Indeed, I should be sad if I looked like him.</t46> <t47>You shrug? I am telling you the truth.</t47> <t48>There is a destiny for all physical and intellectual excellence, a kind of destiny that seems to follow the faltering steps of kings throughout history.</t48> <t49>It is better not to be different from your friends.</t49> <t50>Ugliness and ignorance are always the most advantageous in this world.</t50> <t51>They can sit comfortably and yawn at the game.</t51> <t52>If they know nothing of victory, at least they do not have to know defeat.</t52> <t53>They live as we all should live, peacefully, indifferently, without worry.</t53> <t54>They do not bring trouble to others nor receive it from anyone else.</t54> <t55>Your status and wealth, Harry; my intellect, as it is — my art, whatever it may be worth; the beauty of Dorian Gray — we all must bear what the gods give us, bear it miserably.”</t55>
<t56>“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” Lord Henry asked as he walked across the studio towards Basil Hallward.</t56>
<t57>“Yes, that's his name.</t57> <t58>I didn't intend to tell you that.”</t58>
<t59>“But why not?”</t59>
<t60>“Oh, I can't explain.</t60> <t61>When I really like someone, I never tell anyone their name.</t61> <t62>Doing so is like giving away a part of them.</t62> <t63>I've gradually come to cherish secrecy.</t63> <t64>It seems to be something that can make modern life mysterious or extraordinary for us.</t64> <t65>The most trivial thing becomes interesting if we just hide it away.</t65> <t66>Now, whenever I leave the city, I never tell my family where I’m going.</t66> <t67>If I did, I would lose all my joy.</t67> <t68>It's a silly habit, I'm sure, but somehow it seems to bring a lot of romance to our lives.</t68> <t69>I bet you think I'm extremely foolish about this, don't you?”</t69>
<t70>"Absolutely not," Lord Henry replied, "absolutely not, my dear Basil.</t70> <t71>You seem to forget that I am married, and one of the charms of marriage is that it makes living a lie absolutely necessary for both parties.</t71> <t72>I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing.</t72> <t73>When we meet — we occasionally meet, when we dine out together, or go down to the Duke's — we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces.</t73> <t74>My wife is very good at that — in fact, much better than I am.</t74> <t75>She never gets the dates wrong, while I often do.</t75> <t76>But when she catches me out, she never makes a fuss.</t76> <t77>Sometimes I wish she would; but she only laughs at me."</t77>
<t78>“I hate the way you talk about your family life, Harry,” Basil Hallward said, strolling towards the door leading to the garden.</t78> <t79>“I believe you are truly a very good husband, but you are very embarrassed by your own virtues.</t79> <t80>You are an extremely peculiar person.</t80> <t81>You never say anything moral, and you never do anything wrong.</t81> <t82>Your mockery is simply for show.”</t82>
<t83>“Living in harmony with nature is just for show, and it's the most annoying kind of showmanship I've ever known,” Lord Henry shouted, laughing; and the two young men walked into the garden, then settled on a long bamboo bench placed in the shade of a tall laurel bush.</t83> <t84>Sunlight glided through the glossy leaves.</t84> <t85>On the grass, daisies swayed.</t85>
<t86>After a brief pause, Lord Henry took out his watch.</t86> <t87>“I’m afraid I must be going now, Basil,” he muttered, “and before I go, I implore you to answer the question I posed to you earlier.”</t87>
<t88>“What is it?” the artist said, still staring at the ground.</t88>
<t89>"You know very well."</t89>
<t90>“I don't know, Harry.”</t90>
<t91>“Alright, I will tell you what it is.</t91> <t92>I want you to explain to me why you are not displaying the portrait of Dorian Gray. I want to know the real reason.”</t92>
<t93>“I already told you the real reason.”</t93><t94>”</t94>
<t95>“No, you haven't told me yet.</t95> <t96>You said it was because there were too many things about yourself in it.</t96> <t97>Come on, that sounds very childish.</t97><t98>”</t98>
<t99>“Harry,” Basil Hallward said while looking straight at him, “every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.</t99> <t100>The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion.</t100> <t101>It is not he who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the colored canvas, reveals himself.</t101> <t102>The reason I will not exhibit this painting is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.”</t102>
<t103>Lord Henry laughed. "And what is it?" he asked.</t103>
<t104>“I will tell you,” Hallward said; but a look of confusion crossed his face.</t104>
<t105>"I am eagerly looking forward to it, Basil," his friend continued, glancing at him.</t105>
<t106>“Oh, there really isn't much to tell, Harry,” the artist replied; “and I'm afraid you will find it hard to understand.</t106> <t107>You might find it hard to believe.</t107><t108>”</t108>
<t109>Lord Henry smiled and bent down to pluck a pink-petaled daisy from the grass, examining it.</t109> <t110>“I am sure I can understand it,” he replied, staring intently at the small yellow center covered with white fuzz, “and as for the believable things, I can believe anything, as long as it is utterly unbelievable.”</t110>
<t111>The wind brushed a few flowers off the tree, and the heavy lilac clusters, with their star-shaped blooms, swayed lazily in the air.</t111> <t112>A grasshopper began chirping incessantly by the wall, and like a blue thread, a slender dragonfly drifted past on its brown gauzy wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear Basil Hallward's heartbeat and wondered what was coming.</t112>
<t113>“That's all there is to it,” the artist said after a while.</t113> <t114>“Two months ago I attended a crowded gathering at Mrs. Brandon's place.</t114> <t115>You know, we poor artists sometimes have to show ourselves in society, just to remind the public that we are not barbarians.</t115> <t116>Wearing a dress coat and a white tie, as you once told me, anyone, even a stockbroker, can gain the reputation of being civilized.</t116> <t117>So, after I had been in the room for about ten minutes, talking to overly ostentatious fat widows and dull academicians, I suddenly realized that someone was looking at me.</t117> <t118>I turned halfway around and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.</t118> <t119>When our eyes met, I felt that I was turning pale.</t119> <t120>A dreadful sense of curiosity took hold of me.</t120> <t121>I knew that I was face to face with someone whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, and even my very art.</t121> <t122>I did not want any external influence in my life.</t122> <t123>You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature.</t123> <t124>I have always been able to control myself; and at least it had always been so until I met Dorian Gray. Then — but I don't know how to explain it to you.</t124> <t125>Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.</t125> <t126>I had a strange feeling that Fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows.</t126> <t127>I gradually became afraid, and turned to leave the room.</t127> <t128>It wasn't conscience that made me do so; it was something akin to cowardice.</t128> <t129>I felt no glory in trying to escape.”</t129>
<t130>“Conscience and cowardice are really the same thing, Basil.</t130> <t131>Conscience is the trade name of the firm.</t131> <t132>That is all.”</t132>
<t133>“I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you would either.</t133> <t134>However, regardless of my motive — and it could be pride, as I am often very proud — I still resolutely made my way to the door.</t134> <t135>There, of course, I encountered Mrs. Brandon again.</t135> <t136>‘Don't leave so early, Mr. Hallward?’ she exclaimed.</t136> <t137>Surely you know her strange, shrill voice?”</t137>
<t138>"Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty," said Lord Henry, tearing a daisy into pieces with his long, restless fingers.</t138>
<t139>"I couldn't escape her.</t139> <t140>She took me to meet the princes and those wearing stars and Garter badges, then the elderly ladies with enormous tiaras and parrot-like noses.</t140> <t141>She spoke about me as if I were her closest friend.</t141> <t142>I had only met her once before, but she internalized that encounter to treat me like a celebrity.</t142> <t143>I believe there was some painting of mine that once achieved great success, at least it was mentioned in the penny papers which were the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.</t143> <t144>Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had strangely intrigued me so.</t144> <t145>We were very close, almost touching.</t145> <t146>Our eyes met again.</t146> <t147>It was due to my recklessness, but I asked Mrs. Brandon to introduce me to him.</t147> <t148>Perhaps it wasn't too reckless after all, in the end.</t148> <t149>It was simply unavoidable.</t149> <t150>We could have talked to each other without any introduction at all.</t150> <t151>I'm certain of that.</t151> <t152>Dorian later told me so.</t152> <t153>He also felt that it was our fate to meet."</t153>
<t154>“And how did Mrs. Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” his friend asked.</t154> <t155>“I know she usually gives a quick summary to all her guests.</t155> <t156>I remember she once introduced me to an aggressive elderly gentleman with a flushed face covered in medals and ribbons, and she whispered in my ear, in a tragically audible voice to everyone in the room, the most astonishing details.</t156> <t157>I made a quick escape.</t157> <t158>I prefer to learn about people on my own.</t158> <t159>But Mrs. Brandon treats her guests no differently than an auctioneer treats his items.</t159> <t160>She either explains everything about them or tells people everything except what they actually want to know.”</t160>
<t161>"Poor Mrs. Brandon! You were too harsh on her, Harry!" Hallward said, absent-mindedly.</t161>
<t162>“My friend, she tried to establish a salon, but only succeeded in opening a restaurant.</t162> <t163>How can I admire her?</t163> <t164>But tell me, what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray?”</t164>
<t165>1 Salon: a meeting place for artists.</t165>
<t166>“Oh, some things like, ‘a handsome young man — his poor mother and I can never be apart for a moment.</t166> <t167>Completely forget what he does — afraid that he — does nothing at all — oh, yes, plays the piano — or is it the violin, Mr. Gray?’ Both of us couldn't help but laugh, and we became friends immediately.”</t167>
<t168>“Laughing is certainly not a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far better as an ending for it,” the young gentleman said as he plucked another daisy.</t168>
<t169>Hallward shook his head. "You don't understand what friendship is, Harry," he muttered, "nor what enmity is, either."</t169> <t170>You like everyone; that means you are indifferent to everyone."</t170>
<t171>“You are terribly unfair!” Lord Henry shouted, flipping his hat back and looking up at the small clouds, like tangled, shiny white silk threads, drifting across the deep turquoise of the summer sky. “Yes; you are terribly unfair.</t171> <t172>I understand very well the great difference between people.</t172> <t173>I choose friends because they are beautiful, acquaintances because they are good, and enemies because they are talented.</t173> <t174>No matter how skilled one is, it is never excessive in the selection of enemies. I have not chosen a single fool as an enemy.</t174> <t175>They are all people with considerable intellectual abilities, and therefore they all appreciate me.</t175> <t176>Is that too conceited of me?</t176> <t177>I think it is quite conceited indeed.”</t177>
<t178>“I think so too, Harry. But according to your ranking, I'm probably just an acquaintance.</t178><t179>”</t179>
<t180>“My dear old friend Basil, you are far superior to mere acquaintances.</t180><t181>”</t181>
<t182>"And definitely lost to you.</t182> <t183>A kind of brother, I suppose?"</t183>
<t184>“Oh, my brothers! I don't care about my brothers.</t184> <t185>My brother will not die, and my younger brothers seem to never do anything else at all.</t185><t186>”</t186>
<t187>“Harry!” Hallward shouted, frowning.</t187>
<t188>"My friend, I am not very serious.</t188> <t189>But I cannot help but hate my relationships.</t189> <t190>I suppose it is because none of us can tolerate others having the same faults as we do.</t190> <t191>I fully sympathize with the wrath of British democracy against what they call the vices of the upper class.</t191> <t192>The masses feel that alcoholism, stupidity, and depravity should be their own characteristics, and that if any of us make a fool of ourselves, we have encroached on their territory.</t192> <t193>When poor Southwark went to court to divorce his wife, their indignation was truly remarkable.</t193> <t194>However, I do not think that even ten percent of the lower class live properly."</t194>
<t195>“I do not agree with even a single word you say, and, moreover, Harry, I feel certain that you don't either.”</t195>
<t196>Lord Henry stroked his sharp brown beard, tapping the glossy black cane with a tassel on the tip of his polished leather boot.</t196> <t197>“You really are an Englishman, Basil! This is the second time you've made that remark.</t197> <t198>If someone proposes an idea to a true Englishman — always a risky endeavor — he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.</t198> <t199>The only thing of any significance that he considers is whether the other person believes in it or not.</t199> <t200>For the value of an idea has nothing to do with the sincerity of the person expressing it.</t200> <t201>Indeed, it is very likely that the less sincere a person is, the more purely intellectual the idea will be, as in that case it will not be colored by his own needs, desires, or prejudices.</t201> <t202>However, I do not intend to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.</t202> <t203>I prefer people to principles, and I prefer those without principles to anything else in the world.</t203> <t204>Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.</t204> <t205>Do you see him often?”</t205>
<t206>“We meet every day.</t206> <t207>I can't be happy without seeing him every day.</t207> <t208>I really need him.”</t208>
<t209>"Strange! I thought you didn't pay attention to anything except your art."</t209>
<t210>“He is all my art to me now,” the artist said, very seriously.</t210> <t211>“Sometimes I think, Harry, that there are only two periods that have any significance in the history of the world.</t211> <t212>The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality also for art.</t212> <t213>The things that the invention of oil painting brought to the Venetians, the face of Antinoüs brought to later Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will bring to me one day.</t213> <t214>It’s not simply that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him.</t214> <t215>Of course, I have done all that.</t215> <t216>But he means more to me than just a model or a sitter.</t216> <t217>I won’t tell you that I am not satisfied with what I have done about him, or that his beauty is so marvelous that Art cannot express it.</t217> <t218>There is nothing that Art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done since I met Dorian Gray is good work, the best work of my life.</t218> <t219>But in some strange way — I wonder if you understand me? — his personality has stirred in me a completely new manner of art, a completely new mode of style.</t219> <t220>I see things differently, I think of them differently.</t220> <t221>Now I can recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of thought,’ — who said that? I forget; but that is what Dorian Gray has brought to me.</t221> <t222>Just his mere presence — for to me he seems little more than a boy, though he is really over twenty — just his mere presence — oh! I wonder if you can realize all that that means?</t222> <t223>Unconsciously, he defines for me the limits of a fresh school, a school that has in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that belongs to Greece. The harmony of soul and body — how much that is!</t223> <t224>In our madness, we have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.</t224> <t225>Harry! If you only knew what Dorian Gray means to me! Do you remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a large price, but which I could not part with?</t225> <t226>It is one of the best things I have ever done.</t226> <t227>Why is that?</t227> <t228>Because while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me.</t228> <t229>Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time in my life, I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for, and always missed.”</t229>
<t230>“Basil, this is so strange! I must meet Dorian Gray.”</t230>
<t231>Hallward got up from his seat and paced back and forth in the garden.</t231> <t232>A moment later, he returned.</t232> <t233>“Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is just an artistic motif to me.</t233> <t234>You will never see anything in him.</t234> <t235>I see everything in him.</t235> <t236>He is never more present in my work than when his image is not there.</t236> <t237>He is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new style.</t237> <t238>I see him in the curves of certain lines, in the grace and subtlety of certain colors.</t238> <t239>That's all.”</t239>
<t240>“Then why don't you display his portrait?” Lord Henry asked.</t240>
<t241>“Because, although unintentionally, I have imbued it with some expression of this strange idolatry in art, an idolatry that, of course, I never wanted to discuss with him.</t241> <t242>He knows nothing about it.</t242> <t243>He will never know anything about it.</t243> <t244>But the world might guess it; and I will not expose my soul to their shallow, prying eyes.</t244> <t245>My heart will never be placed under their microscope.</t245> <t246>There is too much of myself in that thing, Harry — too much of myself!”</t246>
<t247>“Poets do not deliberate as much as you do.</t247> <t248>They know how useful passion is for publishing.</t248> <t249>These days, a broken heart will make it into many prints.”</t249>
<t250>“I hate them for that,” Hallward exclaimed. “An artist should create beautiful things, but should not put anything of his own life into them.</t250> <t251>We live in an age where people treat art as if it were some kind of autobiography.</t251> <t252>We have lost the ability to abstractly appreciate beauty.</t252> <t253>One day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason, the world will never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.”</t253>
<t254>“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I will not argue with you.</t254> <t255>Only fools argue.</t255> <t256>Tell me, does Dorian Gray like you very much?”</t256>
<t257>The artist pondered for a few seconds.</t257> <t258>"He likes me," he replied, after a slight hesitation; "I know he likes me.</t258> <t259>Of course, I flatter him excessively.</t259> <t260>I find a strange pleasure in telling him things that I know I will regret saying.</t260> <t261>As usual, he is very charming to me, we sit in the studio and talk about all sorts of things.</t261> <t262>However, sometimes he is terribly reckless, and seems to find real joy in hurting me.</t262> <t263>At those times, I feel, Harry, that I would give my soul to someone who knows how to treat it as if it were a flower to pin on his cloak, a small ornament to beautify his vanity, a decoration for a summer's day."</t263>
<t264>“Summer days, Basil, tend to linger,” Lord Henry murmured. “You might grow bored with him sooner than he with you.</t264> <t265>It is sad to think about, but Talent undoubtedly lasts longer than Beauty.</t265> <t266>That explains why we all put so much effort into refining ourselves over and over.</t266> <t267>In the mad struggle for survival, we want something enduring, so we fill our memories with rubbish and facts, with the naive hope of maintaining our place.</t267> <t268>The know-it-all — that is the ideal of our time.</t268> <t269>And the intellect of the know-it-all is a terrible thing.</t269> <t270>It is like a curiosity shop, full of monsters and dust, with everything priced higher than its true worth.</t270> <t271>I think you will grow bored first, no matter what.</t271> <t272>One day you will look at your friend, and you will see that he seems slightly misdrawn, or you will dislike his tone, or something.</t272> <t273>You will bitterly resent him in your heart, and seriously think that he has treated you very badly.</t273> <t274>The next time he visits, you will be cold and indifferent as if nothing happened.</t274> <t275>That will be a great pity, for it will change you.</t275> <t276>What you have told me is indeed a romantic story, a romantic story about art as one might call it, and the worst thing about having any kind of romantic story is that it makes one become exceedingly ordinary.”</t276>
<t277>"Harry, don't talk like that.</t277> <t278>As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me.</t278> <t279>You cannot feel what I feel.</t279> <t280>You change too often."</t280>
<t281>“Oh, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I feel it.</t281> <t282>Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love; it is the faithless who know the tragedies of love.”</t282> <t283>And Lord Henry lit a cigarette from a dainty silver box, then began to smoke with a cautious and satisfied air, as if he had just summarized the entire world in a single sentence.</t283> <t284>Somewhere, there was the rustling sound of sparrows chirping among the glossy green ivy leaves, while blue shadows flitted across the lawn like swallows.</t284> <t285>How pleasant it was in the garden!</t285> <t286>And how interesting other people's emotions were! — much more pleasant than their ideas, — it seemed to him.</t286> <t287>The soul of a man, and the passions of his friends — those were the fascinating things in life.</t287> <t288>He silently relished the thought of the dull luncheon he had missed by lingering too long with Basil Hallward.</t288> <t289>If he had gone to his aunt's, he would have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about feeding the poor and the necessity of model lodging houses.</t289> <t290>Each class would expound on the importance of virtues that they themselves did not need to practice in their own lives.</t290> <t291>The rich would talk about the value of thrift, while the unemployed would wax eloquent about the true worth of labor.</t291> <t292>How fortunate he was to have escaped all that! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to suddenly occur to him.</t292> <t293>He turned to Hallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”</t293>
<t294>“Remember what, Harry?”</t294>
<t295>“The place where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.” “Where was that?” Hallward asked, frowning slightly.</t295>
<t296>“Don't look so angry, Basil.</t296> <t297>It was at my aunt's place, Lady Agatha's.</t297> <t298>She told me that she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I must say, she never mentioned to me that he was very handsome.</t298> <t299>Women don't appreciate physical beauty; at least, decent women don't.</t299> <t300>She said that he was very earnest and had a good nature.</t300> <t301>I immediately pictured a creature with spectacles and lank hair, freckles galore, and walking around on huge feet. If only I had known he was your friend.”</t301>
<t302>“I am very glad you don't know, Harry.”</t302>
<t303>"Why?"</t303>
<t304>“I don't want you to meet him.”</t304>
<t305>“Don't you want me to meet him?”</t305>
<t306>"No."</t306>
<t307>"Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir," the butler said as he walked into the garden.</t307>
<t308>“You must introduce me at once,” Lord Henry exclaimed and laughed heartily.</t308>
<t309>The painter turned to the servant who was standing and blinking in the sunlight.</t309> <t310>"Tell Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I will be there in a few seconds."</t310> <t311>The servant bowed and hurried away.</t311>
<t312>Then he looked at Lord Henry.</t312> <t313>“Dorian Gray is my closest friend,” he said.</t313> <t314>“His nature is simple and kind.</t314> <t315>Your aunt was absolutely right about him.</t315> <t316>Do not spoil him.</t316> <t317>Do not try to influence him.</t317> <t318>Your influence would be disastrous.</t318> <t319>The world is vast, and it contains many extraordinary people.</t319> <t320>Do not take away from me the person who has given my art all the charm it possesses; my personal life as an artist depends entirely on him.</t320> <t321>Mark my words, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed to be dragged out of him almost against his will.</t321>
<t322>"What nonsense are you talking about!" Lord Henry interrupted, smiling, and, taking Hallward's arm, almost led him into the house.</t322>
<t323>Chapter 2</t323>
<t324>When they entered, they saw Dorian Gray. He was sitting by the piano, his back turned to them, flipping through the pages of Schumann's Forest Scenes.</t324> <t325>"You must lend these to me, Basil," he exclaimed. "I want to learn them.</t325> <t326>They are beautiful."</t326>
<t327>"That entirely depends on how well you sit for the modeling today, Dorian.</t327><t328>"</t328>
<t329>“Oh, I'm tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized portrait of myself,” the young man replied, spinning on the piano stool, showing a stubborn, sulky demeanor.</t329> <t330>When he saw Lord Henry, a slight blush appeared on his cheeks for a moment, and he stood up.</t330> <t331>“I'm sorry, Basil, but I didn't know you had a guest with you.”</t331>
<t332>"This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old friend of mine from Oxford.</t332> <t333>I was just telling him what a perfect model you are, and now you've ruined everything.</t333><t334>"</t334>
<t335>“You haven't spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr.</t335> <t336>Gray,” Lord Henry said, stepping forward and extending his hand.</t336> <t337>“My aunt often talks to me about you.</t337> <t338>You are one of her most admired people, and, I fear, also one of her victims.”</t338>
<t339>“I am in Mrs. Agatha's black book,” Dorian replied, with a comically apologetic look.</t339> <t340>“I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I completely forgot about it.</t340> <t341>We were supposed to play a duet together — three duets, I think.</t341> <t342>I don't know what she will say to me.</t342> <t343>I'm so scared that I don't dare to visit her.”</t343>
<t344>“Oh, I will reconcile you with my aunt.</t344> <t345>She is very devoted to you.</t345> <t346>And I don't think there's really any serious issue with you not going there.</t346> <t347>The audience probably thought it was a duet.</t347> <t348>Whenever Aunt Agatha sits down at the piano, she usually makes enough noise for two people.”</t348>
<t349>“Saying that would be too harsh on her, and not very nice for me either,” Dorian laughed, responding.</t349>
<t350>Lord Henry looked at him.</t350> <t351>Yes, he was truly extremely handsome, with perfectly curved red lips, honest blue eyes, and golden curly hair.</t351> <t352>There was something about his face that made people trust him immediately.</t352> <t353>All the carefree youthfulness was there, as well as all the earnest purity of youth.</t353> <t354>One felt that he had kept himself untainted by the world.</t354> <t355>No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.</t355>
<t356>“You are too charming to do charity work, Mr. Gray — far too charming.”</t356> <t357>And Lord Henry threw himself onto the couch, then opened his cigarette case.</t357>
<t358>The painter is busy mixing colors and preparing brushes.</t358> <t359>He looks anxious, and when he hears Lord Henry's last remark, he glances at him, hesitates for a moment, then says, "Harry, I want to finish this painting today.</t359> <t360>Do you think it would be too rude of me to ask you to leave?"</t360>
<t361>Lord Henry smiled, looking at Dorian Gray.</t361> <t362>"Shall I go, Mr. Gray?" he asked.</t362>
<t363>“Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is just in a sulky mood; and I can't stand him when he's sulking.</t363> <t364>Besides, I want you to tell me why I shouldn't continue doing charity work.</t364><t365>”</t365>
<t366>“I didn't know I had to talk to you about that matter, Mr. Gray.</t366> <t367>It is such a tedious topic that one has to speak seriously about it.</t367> <t368>But I surely don't have to run outside, since you have asked me to stay.</t368> <t369>You really don't mind, Basil, do you?</t369> <t370>You often tell me that you like your models to have someone to talk to.”</t370>
<t371>Hallward bit his lip. "If Dorian wants it that way, then of course you can stay.</t371> <t372>Dorian's whims are law for everyone, except for himself."</t372>
<t373>Lord Henry picked up his hat and gloves. "You are very persistent, Basil, but I'm afraid I must go.</t373> <t374>I have promised to meet someone in Orleans.</t374> <t375>Goodbye, Mr. Gray. Do come and see me some afternoon on Curzon Street.</t375> <t376>I am almost always at home at five o'clock. Write to me beforehand when you are coming.</t376> <t377>I would be very sorry to miss you."</t377>
<t378>"Basil," Dorian Gray exclaimed, "if Lord Henry Wotton leaves, then I will also leave.</t378> <t379>You never speak while you are painting, and it is terribly boring to stand on the platform and try to look cheerful.</t379> <t380>Please ask him to stay.</t380> <t381>I beg you."</t381>
<t382>“Stay, Harry, to do a favor for Dorian, and to do a favor for me,” Hallward said while intently looking at his painting.</t382> <t383>“Really, I never talk when I am working, and I never listen either, and that must be terribly boring for my unfortunate models.</t383> <t384>I beg you to stay.”</t384>
<t385>"What about my man in Orleans?"</t385>
<t386>The artist laughed.</t386> <t387>"I don't think there will be any difficulty with that."</t387> <t388>“Now sit down again, Harry. Now then, Dorian, get on the platform, and don't move too much, or pay attention to what Lord Henry says.</t388> <t389>He has a very bad influence on all his friends, except for me.”</t389>
<t390>Dorian Gray stepped onto the platform with the demeanor of a Greek youth martyred, and made a slight grimace to show his displeasure before Lord Henry, whom he had come to quite admire.</t390> <t391>He was entirely different from Basil.</t391> <t392>They created an interesting contrast.</t392> <t393>And he had such a wonderful voice.</t393> <t394>After a few seconds, he said to him, "Are you really a bad influence, Lord Henry? As bad as Basil says?"</t394>
<t395>“There is nothing like a good influence, Mr. Gray.</t395> <t396>All influence is immoral — immoral from the scientific point of view.</t396><t397>”</t397>
<t398>"Why?"</t398>
<t399>“To influence a person is to give him one's own soul.</t399> <t400>He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions.</t400> <t401>His virtues are not real to him anymore.</t401> <t402>His sins, if there is such a thing as sins, are borrowed.</t402> <t403>He becomes an echo of someone else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him.</t403> <t404>The aim of life is self-development.</t404> <t405>To realize one's nature perfectly — that is what each of us is here for.</t405> <t406>Nowadays people are afraid of themselves.</t406> <t407>They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to oneself.</t407> <t408>Of course they are charitable.</t408> <t409>They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar.</t409> <t410>But their own souls are starving and naked.</t410> <t411>Courage has left our race.</t411> <t412>Perhaps we never really had it.</t412> <t413>Fear of society, which is the basis of morality, fear of God, which is the secret of religion — these are the two things that govern us. And yet…”</t413>
<t414>“Please turn your head a little to the right, Dorian, please,” the artist said, immersed in his work, and only noticed that a certain feature he had never seen before had just appeared on the young man's face.</t414>
<t415>“And yet,” Lord Henry continued, in a soft, melodious voice, and with the graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and which he had even used in his days at Eton, “I believe that if one were to live out their life fully and completely, to shape every emotion, to express every thought, to realize every dream — I believe the world would gain such a fresh, joyous impulse that we would forget all the maladies of medieval spirit, and return to the Greek ideal — perhaps to something higher, more precious than the Greek ideal.</t415> <t416>But the bravest among us is afraid of himself.</t416> <t417>The barbaric custom of mutilation leaves its tragic remnants in the chastity that is corrupting our lives.</t417> <t418>We are punished for our own refusals.</t418> <t419>Every impulse we strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us.</t419> <t420>The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.</t420> <t421>There is nothing left after that but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret.</t421> <t422>The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.</t422> <t423>Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.</t423> <t424>It has been said that the greatest events of the world take place in the brain.</t424> <t425>It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also.</t425> <t426>You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheeks with shame…”</t426>
<t428>"Stop!" Dorian Gray stammered, "stop! You are confusing me too much.</t428> <t429>I don't know what to say anymore.</t429> <t430>There must be some answer for you, but I can't find it.</t430> <t431>Don't speak anymore.</t431> <t432>Let me think.</t432> <t433>Or rather, let me try not to think anymore."</t433>
<t434>For nearly ten minutes, he stood there, motionless, with slightly parted lips and strangely bright eyes.</t434> <t435>He vaguely realized that entirely new influences were stirring within him.</t435> <t436>Yet he felt as if they truly came from inside him.</t436> <t437>A few words that Basil's friend had just said to him — words spoken casually, undoubtedly, with intentional paradox within them — had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, but now he felt it vibrating and beating with curious rhythms.</t437>
<t438>Music once moved you like that.</t438> <t439>Music once tormented you many times.</t439> <t440>But music does not speak clearly.</t440> <t441>It is not a new world, but rather another chaos, the one created within us.</t441> <t442>Words! Just words! How terrifying they are! How pure, vivid, and cruel!</t442> <t443>One cannot escape from them.</t443> <t444>And what an enchanting magic they possess!</t444> <t445>They seem to have the ability to shape the shapeless, and possess a music of their own as sweet as that of the violin and the lute.</t445> <t446>Just words! Is there anything as real as words?</t446>
<t447>Yes; there are things from your youth that you didn't understand.</t447> <t448>Now you understand them.</t448> <t449>Life suddenly becomes vivid and colorful for you.</t449> <t450>You feel as if you are walking through fire.</t450> <t451>Why had you never known this before?</t451>
<t452>With a subtle smile, Lord Henry observed the boy.</t452> <t453>He knew well the precise psychological moment when nothing needed to be said.</t453> <t454>He found it extremely amusing. He was astonished by the sudden impression his words had made, and, recalling a book he had read when he was sixteen, a book that had opened up many things to him that he had not known before, he wondered if Dorian Gray was going through a similar experience.</t454> <t455>He had merely shot an arrow into the air at random.</t455> <t456>Did it hit the target?</t456> <t457>How charming this young man was!</t457>
<t458>Hallward painted diligently with an extraordinarily bold technique, containing precise elegance and perfect finesse that, in art, no matter what, always originates from inner strength.</t458> <t459>He did not notice the silence.</t459>
<t460>“Basil, I'm tired of standing,” Dorian Gray suddenly exclaimed.</t460> <t461>“I must go out and sit in the garden.</t461> <t462>The air here is too stuffy.”</t462>
<t463>"My dear, I'm sorry.</t463> <t464>When I draw, I can't think about anything else.</t464> <t465>But you've never sat as a better model.</t465> <t466>You were perfectly still.</t466> <t467>And I captured the impression I wanted — the slightly parted lips, the radiance in the eyes.</t467> <t468>I don't know what Harry said to you, but he certainly brought out the best expression in you.</t468> <t469>I suppose he complimented you.</t469> <t470>You shouldn't believe a single word he says."</t470>
<t471>“He definitely does not compliment me.</t471> <t472>Perhaps that is the reason why I do not believe anything he tells me.”</t472>
<t473>"You know you believe it all," Lord Henry said, looking at him with dreamy, languid eyes. "I will go to the garden with you.</t473> <t474>It's terribly hot in the studio.</t474> <t475>Basil, give us something cold to drink, something with strawberries in it."</t475>
<t476>“Of course, Harry.</t476> <t477>Just ring the bell, and when Parker comes, I'll tell him what you want.</t477> <t478>I have to get started on this background, so I'll join you later.</t478> <t479>Don't keep Dorian too long.</t479> <t480>I've never been more excited about painting than today.</t480> <t481>This will be my masterpiece.</t481> <t482>It already is my masterpiece even now.”</t482>
<t483>Lord Henry stepped out into the garden and saw Dorian Gray burying his face in the large, cool lilacs, awkwardly drinking in their fragrance as if it were wine.</t483> <t484>He approached him and placed a hand on his shoulder. "You are doing the right thing," he whispered.</t484> <t485>"Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.</t485><t486>"</t486>
<t487>The young man was startled and stepped back.</t487> <t488>He was bareheaded, with leaves tossing his unruly curls and tangling their golden threads.</t488> <t489>There was a look of fear in his eyes, as people often have when they suddenly wake up.</t489> <t490>His finely chiseled nostrils quivered, some hidden nerve lightly tugged at his crimson lips, leaving them trembling.</t490>
<t491>“Yes,” Lord Henry continued, “that is one of the great secrets of life — to heal the soul by means of the senses, and to heal the senses by means of the soul.</t491> <t492>You are a wonderful creation.</t492> <t493>You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.</t493><t494>”</t494>
<t495>Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away.</t495><t496>He couldn't help but like the tall, young, elegant man standing beside him.</t496><t497>The dreamy olive face and the weariness of the man made him take notice.</t497><t498>There was something in his languid, soft voice that had an absolute allure.</t498><t499>Even his cool, white hands, like flowers, had a strange charm.</t499><t500>They moved, when he spoke, like music, and seemed to have their own language.</t500><t501>But he was afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid.</t501><t502>Why let a stranger expose him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but their friendship had never changed him.</t502><t503>Suddenly, someone had casually entered his life and seemed to reveal to him the mysteries of existence.</t503><t504>And, after all, what was there to fear? He was neither a schoolboy nor a young girl.</t504><t505>There was nothing to fear.</t505>
<t506>“Let's sit in the shade,” Lord Henry said.</t506> <t507>“Parker has brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glaring light, you'll lose much of your charm, and Basil will never paint you again.</t507> <t508>You really shouldn't let yourself get tanned.</t508> <t509>It wouldn't suit you.”</t509>
<t510>“What does that matter anyway?” Dorian Gray exclaimed with a laugh as he sat down on the chair at the end of the garden.</t510>
<t511>“That matter is of utmost importance to you, Mr. Gray.”</t511>
<t512>“Why?”</t512>
<t513>“Because you are in the most wonderful period of youth, and youth is something valuable.”</t513>
<t514>“I don't see it that way, Lord Henry.”</t514>
<t515>"No, you won't see it right now.</t515> <t516>One day, when you are old, wrinkled, and ugly, when thought has furrowed your forehead with its plows, and passion has scorched your lips with its hideous flames, you will see it, you will find it unbearable.</t516> <t517>Now, wherever you go, you enchant the world.</t517> <t518>Will it always be like that?...</t518> <t519>You have a beautiful face, Mr. Gray.</t519> <t520>Don't frown.</t520> <t521>You do.</t521> <t522>And Beauty is a form of Genius — actually, it is above Genius because it needs no explanation.</t522> <t523>It is one of the greatest truths of the world, like sunlight, spring, or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon.</t523> <t524>It is indisputable.</t524> <t525>It has the supreme divine right of sovereignty.</t525> <t526>It transforms those who possess it into kings.</t526> <t527>You laugh? Oh! When you lose it, you won't be able to laugh... Sometimes people say that beauty is only superficial.</t527> <t528>It may be so.</t528> <t529>But at least it is not as superficial as Thought.</t529> <t530>To me, Beauty is the wonder of wonders.</t530> <t531>Only shallow people do not judge by appearances.</t531> <t532>The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.</t532> <t533>Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been very good to you.</t533> <t534>But what the gods give, they quickly take away.</t534> <t535>You have only a few years to live truly, live perfectly, live fully.</t535> <t536>When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to be content with those pitiful victories that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.</t536> <t537>Each waning moon brings you closer to something dreadful.</t537> <t538>Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.</t538> <t539>You will become sallow, hollow-cheeked, dull-eyed.</t539> <t540>You will suffer horribly... Oh! Realize your youth while you have it.</t540> <t541>Don't squander the gold of your days, don't listen to the tedious, don't try to improve the hopeless failures, or give your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.</t541> <t542>These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age.</t542> <t543>Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you.</t543> <t544>Always search for new sensations.</t544> <t545>Be afraid of nothing... A new Hedonism — that is what our century needs.</t545> <t546>You might be its visible symbol.</t546> <t547>With your personality, there is nothing you could not do.</t547> <t548>The world belongs to you for a season... The moment I met you, I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be.</t548> <t549>There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself.</t549> <t550>I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.</t550> <t551>For there is such a little time that your youth will last — such a little time.</t551> <t552>The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again.</t552> <t553>The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now.</t553> <t554>In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year, the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.</t554> <t555>But we never get back our youth.</t555> <t556>The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish.</t556> <t557>Our limbs fail, our senses rot.</t557> <t558>We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions we were too much afraid to yield to, and the exquisite temptations we had not the courage to yield to.</t558> <t559>Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!”</t559>
<t560>Dorian Gray listened, his eyes wide with astonishment.</t560> <t561>The lilac branch fell from his hand onto the grass.</t561> <t562>A fuzzy bee flew over and buzzed around for a moment.</t562> <t563>Then it began to crawl all over the star-speckled oval gourd.</t563> <t564>He watched it with that strange fascination we often show for trivial things when important matters frighten us, or when we are distracted by some new emotion we cannot find words to express, or when some terrifying idea suddenly besieges our mind and calls for our surrender.</t564> <t565>A moment later, the bee flew away.</t565> <t566>He watched it crawl into the tarnished trumpet of a royal purple morning glory.</t566> <t567>The flower seemed to tremble, then gently sway.</t567>
<t568>Suddenly, the artist appeared at the entrance to the studio and gestured silently to invite them inside.</t568> <t569>They turned to each other and laughed.</t569>
<t570>“I'm waiting here,” he shouted. “Come on in.</t570> <t571>The light is perfect, and you can bring your drinks along.</t571><t572>”</t572>
<t573>“They stood up, wandering together.</t573> <t574>Two blue-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and, on the pear tree in the corner of the garden, a thrush sang.</t574>
<t575>“Are you happy to see me, Mr. Gray,” Lord Henry said, looking at him.</t575>
<t576>“Yes, I am happy.</t576> <t577>I wonder if I will always be happy?”</t577>
<t578>“Forever!”</t578> <t579>“That is a terrible word.</t579> <t580>It makes me shudder every time I hear it.</t580> <t581>Women love to use it.</t581> <t582>They ruin every romantic affair by trying to make it last forever.</t582> <t583>It is also a meaningless word.</t583> <t584>The only difference between a whim and a lifelong passion is that a whim lasts a little longer.”</t584>
<t585>When they entered the studio, Dorian Gray placed his hand on Lord Henry's arm.</t585> <t586>"If so, let our friendship be a whim," he whispered, blushing at his own boldness, then stepped onto the platform and resumed his modeling pose.</t586>
<t587>Lord Henry dropped himself into the spacious wicker armchair and observed him.</t587> <t588>The strokes and brush marks on the canvas created the only sound breaking the silence, except for the occasional moments when Hallward stepped back to view his work from a distance.</t588> <t589>In the slanting beams of light streaming through the open window, dust danced and turned golden.</t589> <t590>The fragrant scent of roses seemed to envelop everything.</t590>
<t591>After about a quarter of an hour, Hallward stopped painting, gazed at Dorian Gray for a long time, then looked at the painting for a long time, biting the end of one of his huge paintbrushes, frowning.</t591> <t592>"It's all done," he finally exclaimed and bent down to write his name in long red letters on the bottom left corner of the canvas.</t592>
<t593>Lord Henry approached and examined the painting closely.</t593> <t594>It was indeed an extraordinary piece of art, and the resemblance was also remarkable.</t594>
<t595>“Dear friend, I warmly congratulate you,” he said.</t595> <t596>“This is the most beautiful portrait of the time.</t596> <t597>Mr. Gray, come here and look at yourself.”</t597>
<t598>The young man was startled, as if waking up from some dream.</t598> <t599>"Is it really over?" he whispered, stepping down from the platform.</t599>
<t600>"It's completely done," the artist said.</t600> <t601>"And today you posed wonderfully.</t601> <t602>I am extremely grateful to you."</t602>
<t603>"It's all my doing," Lord Henry interrupted.</t603> <t604>"Isn't that right, Mr. Gray?"</t604>
<t605>Dorian did not respond, but indifferently walked past his painting, then turned towards it.</t605> <t606>When he saw it, he stepped back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment with joy.</t606> <t607>A look of delight appeared in his eyes, as if he recognized himself for the first time.</t607> <t608>He stood motionless in astonishment, vaguely aware that Hallward was speaking to him, but unable to grasp the meaning of his words.</t608> <t609>The awareness of his own beauty came to him like an enlightenment.</t609> <t610>He had never felt that before.</t610> <t611>Basil Hallward's praises seemed to him merely the charming exaggerations of friendship.</t611> <t612>He had heard them, laughed at them, and forgotten them.</t612> <t613>They did not affect his nature.</t613> <t614>Then Lord Henry Wotton came with his strange eulogy of youth, with his terrible warning of its brevity.</t614> <t615>That had unsettled him at the time, and now, as he stood staring at the image of his own beauty, the full reality of that description flashed across him.</t615> <t616>Yes, there would come a day when his face would be wrinkled and withered, his eyes would dim, and his graceful figure would become bloated and deformed.</t616> <t617>The crimson would fade from his lips, the gold would flee from his hair.</t617> <t618>The life that had made his soul would also mar his body.</t618> <t619>He would become dreadful, hideous, and coarse.</t619>
<t620>While he was thinking about it, a sharp pain pierced through him like a knife, making every soft fiber of his being tremble.</t620> <t621>His eyes were a deep amethyst color, and across them — a veil of blurred tears.</t621> <t622>He felt as if an icy hand had just been placed on his heart.</t622>
<t623>“You don't like it?” Hallward finally exclaimed, a bit distressed by the young man's silence, not understanding what it meant.</t623>
<t624>“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry.</t624> <t625>“Who wouldn't like it? It is one of the greatest works of modern art.</t625> <t626>I will give you anything you want for it.</t626> <t627>I must have it.”</t627>
<t628>“It does not belong to me, Harry.”</t628>
<t629>"So, who owns it?"</t629>
<t630>“Dorian's, of course,” the artist replied.</t630> <t631>“He is a very lucky young man.”</t631>
<t632>“How sad it is!” Dorian Gray whispered, his eyes still fixed on the portrait of himself.</t632> <t633>“How sad it is! I will gradually grow old, ugly, and horrible.</t633> <t634>But this picture will remain young forever.</t634> <t635>It will never be older than this particular day in June… If only there were another way!</t635> <t636>If only I could stay young and the picture would grow old! For that — for that — I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world that I would not give! I would give my soul for that!”</t636>
<t637>"You will hardly be able to arrange such a setup, Basil," Lord Henry exclaimed, laughing.</t637> <t638>"It will become a misfortune in your work."</t638>
<t639>"I will probably oppose it to the end, Harry," Hallward said.</t639>
<t640>Dorian Gray turned to look at him.</t640> <t641>"I believe you will, Basil.</t641> <t642>You love your art more than your friends.</t642> <t643>You see me as nothing more than a bronze statue turning green.</t643> <t644>It's hard to match that, I dare say."</t644>
<t645>The artist stared in astonishment.</t645> <t646>It did not seem like Dorian had said that.</t646> <t647>What had happened?</t647> <t648>You seemed quite angry.</t648> <t649>Your face was flushed and your cheeks were glowing.</t649>
<t650>“Yes,” he continued, “You regard me as less than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun. You will always like them.</t650> <t651>How long will you like me? Until I get my first wrinkle, I suppose.</t651> <t652>Now I know that when one loses their beauty, whatever it may be, they lose everything.</t652> <t653>Your painting taught me that.</t653> <t654>Lord Henry Wotton was absolutely right.</t654> <t655>Youth is the only thing worth having.</t655> <t656>When I see myself growing old, I will kill myself.”</t656>
<t657>Hallward turned pale, grasping his hand. "Dorian! Dorian!" he cried, "don't say that.</t657> <t658>I've never had a friend like you, and I never will have another like that.</t658> <t659>You're not jealous of those tangible things, are you? — you're more beautiful than any of them!”</t659>
<t660>“I am jealous of everything that has immortal beauty.</t660> <t661>I am jealous of the portrait you painted of me.</t661> <t662>Why can it retain what I must lose?</t662> <t663>Every passing moment takes something from me and gives something to it.</t663> <t664>Oh, if only there were another way!</t664> <t665>If the painting could change, and I could remain as I am now! Why did you paint it?</t665> <t666>One day it will mock me — mock me terribly!” Hot tears welled up in his eyes; he pulled his hand away, and, throwing himself onto the couch, he buried his face in the cushion, as if in prayer.</t666>
<t667>"This is your doing, Harry," the artist said bitterly.</t667>
<t668>Lord Henry shrugged. "That is Dorian Gray — that's all.</t668><t669>"</t669>
<t670>"No."</t670>
<t671>“If not, then what do I have to do with it?”</t671>
<t672>“You should have left when I asked you,” he muttered.</t672> <t673>“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry's reply.</t673>
<t674>"Harry, I can't argue with my two best friends at the same time, but just between the two of you, you have made me hate the most beautiful work I have ever created, and I will destroy it.</t674> <t675>What is it but canvas and paint? I will not let it interfere with our three lives and ruin them."</t675>
<t676>Dorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and, with a pale face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him, while he</t676> <t677>walked to the pine drawing table under the tall, curtained window.</t677> <t678>What was he doing there?</t678> <t679>His fingers wandered among the clutter of tin tubes and dry brushes, searching for something.</t679> <t680>Yes, searching for the long palette knife, with its thin, soft steel blade.</t680> <t681>At last he found it.</t681> <t682>He would slash the canvas.</t682>
<t683>With a sobbing cry, the young man jumped off the couch, and, rushing to Hallward, snatched the knife from his hand, throwing it to the other side of the studio. "Don't, Basil, don't!" he shouted. "That's murder!"</t683>
<t684>"I am glad that you have finally appreciated my work, Dorian," the artist said coldly, as he calmed down after the surprise.</t684> <t685>"I never thought you would."</t685>
<t686>"Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil.</t686> <t687>It is a part of myself.</t687> <t688>That's how I feel."</t688>
<t689>"Alright, as soon as you are dry, you will be varnished, framed, and sent home.</t689> <t690>After that, you can do whatever you like with yourself." And he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea. "Will you have some tea, Dorian?</t690> <t691>And you too, Harry? Or do you object to even such simple pleasures?"</t691>
<t692>“I admire simple pleasures,” Lord Henry said.</t692> <t693>“They are the last refuge of the complex.</t693> <t694>But I do not like scenes, except on the stage.</t694> <t695>How ridiculous you both are! I wonder who defined man as a rational animal. It was the most hasty definition ever given.</t695> <t696>Man is many things, but he is not rational.</t696> <t697>I am glad he is not, after all: though I wish you two would not quarrel over the picture.</t697> <t698>You had better let me have it, Basil.</t698> <t699>This silly boy doesn’t really want it, and I really do.”</t699>
<t700>“If you let anyone else have it besides me, Basil, I will never forgive you!” Dorian Gray exclaimed; “and I do not allow people to call me a foolish boy.</t700><t701>”</t701>
<t702>"You know the painting is yours, Dorian.</t702> <t703>I gave it to you before it even existed."</t703>
<t704>“And you know you used to be a naive boy, Mr. Gray, and that you don't really feel upset about being reminded that you are extremely young.”</t704>
<t705>"I should have felt extremely uncomfortable this morning, Lord Henry."</t705>
<t706>"Oh! This morning! You lived through that moment."</t706>
<t707>There was a knock on the door, the butler entered with a heavy tray of tea and placed it on the small Japanese table.</t707> <t708>There was the clinking of cups and the whistling of the antique George-era grooved teapot.</t708> <t709>Two spherical porcelain bowls were brought in by a young servant.</t709> <t710>Dorian Gray approached and poured the tea.</t710> <t711>The two of them wandered closer to the table and looked to see what was under the lid.</t711>
<t712>“Let's go watch a play tonight,” Lord Henry said.</t712> <t713>“There must be something showing, somewhere.</t713> <t714>I had promised to have dinner at White's, but it's just with an old friend, so I can send him a telegram saying that I'm ill, or that I'm prevented from coming due to a later invitation.</t714> <t715>I think that would be a rather good excuse: it will have all the straightforward surprise.</t715><t716>”</t716>
<t717>“It is really tedious to have to wear formal attire,” Hallward muttered. “And, when people put them on, they look so dreadful.”</t717>
<t718>“That's right,” Lord Henry said dreamily, “nineteenth-century clothing is truly disgusting.</t718> <t719>It is too gloomy, too dreary.</t719> <t720>Sin is the only real color left in modern life.”</t720>
<t721>"You really shouldn't say things like that in front of Dorian, Harry."</t721>
<t722>“Which Dorian are you talking about?</t722> <t723>The one pouring tea for us, or the one in the painting?”</t723>
<t724>"In front of both of them."</t724>
<t725>“I would like to go see the play with you, Lord Henry,” the young man said.</t725>
<t726>“Then you just go; and you will go too, Basil, won't you?”</t726>
<t727>“I really can't.</t727> <t728>I prefer staying at home. I have too much work to do.</t728><t729>”</t729>
<t730>“Is that so? Then you and I will go separately, Mr. Gray.”</t730>
<t731>“I like it extremely.”</t731>
<t732>The painter bit his lip and walked, with a cup in hand, towards the painting.</t732> <t733>"I will stay with Dorian indeed," he said, sorrowfully.</t733>
<t734>“Is that really Dorian?” the original of the portrait exclaimed, strolling past him. “Do I really look like that?”</t734>
<t735>“Yes; you look exactly like that.”</t735>
<t736>"Wonderful, Basil!"</t736>
<t737>"At least you resemble it on the outside.</t737> <t738>But it will never change," Hallward sighed.</t738> <t739>"That's what makes it precious."</t739>
<t740>“People make too much of loyalty!” “Why, even in love, it is merely a matter of physiology.</t740> <t741>It has nothing to do with our will.</t741> <t742>The young want to be faithful but can't; the old want to be unfaithful but can't: that's all there is to say.”</t742>
<t743>“Don't go to the theater tonight, Dorian,” Hallward said. “Stay and have dinner with me.”</t743>
<t744>"I can't, Basil."</t744>
<t745>"Why?"</t745>
<t746>“Because I promised Lord Henry Wotton that I would go with him.”</t746>
<t747>"He doesn't like you more because you keep your promises.</t747> <t748>He always breaks his promises.</t748> <t749>I beg you not to go."</t749>
<t750>Dorian Gray smiled and shook his head.</t750>
<t751>“I beg you.”</t751>
<t752>The young man hesitated and glanced at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea table with a delighted smile.</t752>
<t753>“I have to go, Basil,” he replied.</t753>
<t754>“Alright,” Hallward said; then he approached and placed the cup on the tray.</t754> <t755>“It's quite late, and since you have to change clothes, it's best not to waste any more time.</t755> <t756>Goodbye, Harry.</t756> <t757>Goodbye, Dorian.</t757> <t758>Come see me soon.</t758> <t759>Come tomorrow.”</t759>
<t760>"Of course."</t760>
<t761>“You won't forget, right?”</t761>
<t762>“No, of course not,” Dorian exclaimed.</t762>
<t763>"Ah... Harry!"</t763>
<t764>"Yes, Basil?"</t764>
<t765>"Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this morning."</t765>
<t766>“I have already forgotten.”</t766>
<t767>"I believe you."</t767>
<t768>“I wish I could trust myself,” Lord Henry said with a laugh.</t768> <t769>“Now, Mr. Gray, my hansom cab is outside, and I can drop you off at your place.</t769> <t770>Goodbye, Basil.</t770> <t771>It has been an extremely delightful afternoon.”</t771>
<t772>When the door closed behind them, the artist sank onto the sofa, and a look of pain appeared on his face.</t772>
<t773>Chapter 3</t773>
<t774>At half-past twelve the next day, Lord Henry Wotton leisurely walked from Curzon Street through Albany to visit his uncle, Lord Fermor, a cheerful old bachelor despite his somewhat rude manners. The outside world considered him selfish because they couldn't gain any exceptional benefits from him, but the upper class viewed him as very generous because he supported those who entertained him.</t774> <t775>His father had been our ambassador in Madrid when Isabella was young, and Prim was not yet thought of, but he had left the diplomatic service in a fit of pique over not being invited to be the ambassador in Paris, a position he believed he was entirely entitled to because of his lineage, his laziness, his perfect English in his dispatches, and his excessive passion for pleasure.</t775> <t776>The son, who had been his father's secretary, also resigned along with his boss, a move that was considered somewhat foolish at the time, and when he inherited the title a few months later, he devoted himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.</t776> <t777>He had two large houses in town but preferred to live in a furnished bachelor apartment to avoid inconvenience and mostly dined at his club.</t777> <t778>He also paid some attention to managing his coal mines in the Midlands, justifying this industrial stain on the grounds that one advantage of having coal was that it allowed a gentleman to afford to burn wood in his fireplace.</t778> <t779>In politics, he was a Conservative, except when the Conservatives were in power, during which time he openly insulted them for turning into Radicals.</t779> <t780>He was a hero to his valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relatives, whom he bullied in turn.</t780> <t781>Only England could have produced him, and he always said that the country was going to the dogs.</t781> <t782>His principles were outdated, but there was much to be said in favor of his prejudices.</t782>
<t783>When Lord Henry entered the room, he saw his uncle sitting, wearing a coarse hunting jacket, smoking a cigar cut at both ends, and grumbling over The Times, "Ah, Harry," the old man said, "what brings you out so early?</t783> <t784>I thought you dandies never got up before two and never appeared before five."</t784>
<t785>“It's just pure family affection, I assure you of that, Uncle George.”</t785> <t786>“I want to ask you for this favor.”</t786>
<t787>"Money, you think so," Lord Fermor said, making a face.</t787> <t788>"Now, sit down and tell me all about it.</t788> <t789>Young people today think money is everything.</t789><t790>"</t790>
<t791>“Yes,” Lord Henry whispered, adjusting the flower in his buttonhole; “and when they grow old, they know it is true.</t791> <t792>But you don't need money.</t792> <t793>Only those who have bills to pay need it, Uncle George, and I never have to pay mine.</t793> <t794>Credit is the capital of the second son, and he lives comfortably on it.</t794> <t795>Besides, I always deal with the merchants of Dartmoor, so they never bother me.</t795> <t796>What I want is information; not useful information, of course; but useless information.”</t796>
<t797>"Yes, I can tell you everything in the British Blue Book, Harry, although these days they write a lot of nonsense. When I was in the diplomatic service, things were much better.</t797> <t798>But I hear now they let them in through exams.</t798> <t799>What else can you expect?</t799> <t800>Exams, my boy, are just a fraud from start to finish.</t800> <t801>If a man is a gentleman, he will know enough, and if he is not a gentleman, then all he knows will only harm him."</t801>
<t802>"Mr. Dorian Gray has nothing to do with the Blue Book, Uncle George," Lord Henry said languidly.</t802>
<t803>“Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?” Lord Fermor asked, furrowing his thick white eyebrows.</t803>
<t804>“That is what I came to hear, Uncle George.</t804> <t805>Or rather, I already know who he is.</t805> <t806>He is the grandson of the last Lord Kelso.</t806> <t807>His mother was a Devereux; Margaret Devereux.</t807> <t808>I want you to tell me about his mother.</t808> <t809>What was she like?</t809> <t810>Whom did she marry?</t810> <t811>You know almost everyone of that time, so you might know her.</t811> <t812>At present, I am very interested in Mr. Gray. I have just met him.</t812>
<t813>“Kelso's grandson!” the old man repeated — “Kelso's grandson!…</t813> <t814>That's right… I knew his mother very well.</t814> <t815>I believe I attended her baptism.</t815> <t816>She was a beautiful woman, Margaret Devereux; and she drove all the men crazy by eloping with a penniless young man; a nobody, my dear, a lieutenant in the infantry regiment, or something like that.</t816> <t817>Absolutely.</t817> <t818>I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday.</t818> <t819>The poor young man was killed in a duel at Spa, a few months after the wedding.</t819> <t820>There's a dreadful story about it.</t820> <t821>They say Kelso hired some thug, a brutal Belgian, to insult his son-in-law in public; paid him, my dear, to do it, paid him; and that fellow skewered his victim as if he were a pigeon.</t821> <t822>The matter was hushed up, but, oh dear, Kelso ate his chops alone at the club for quite a long time afterward.</t822> <t823>He took his daughter back, I heard, and she never spoke to him again.</t823> <t824>Yes, indeed; it was a very bad business.</t824> <t825>The girl died too; died within a year.</t825> <t826>So she left a son, did she? I had forgotten that.</t826> <t827>What sort of boy is he? If he takes after his mother, he must be a very handsome young man.”</t827>
<t828>“He is very beautiful,” Lord Henry agreed.</t828>
<t829>“I hope it falls into the right hands,” the old man continued.</t829> <t830>“It would have had a pile of money waiting if Kelso had done the right thing for it.</t830> <t831>Its mother also has money.</t831> <t832>All the Selby family assets were transferred to her, through her grandfather.</t832> <t833>Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought he was a despicable scoundrel.</t833> <t834>He was just the same.</t834> <t835>Came to Madrid once while I was there.</t835> <t836>Oh my, I was so embarrassed by him.</t836> <t837>The Queen often asked me about an English nobleman who frequently argued with the coachmen over fares.</t837> <t838>They made up a whole story about that incident.</t838> <t839>I didn't dare show my face at the Palace for a whole month.</t839> <t840>I hope he treats his grandchild better than he treated those hired drivers.</t840><t841>”</t841>
<t842>“I don't know,” Lord Henry replied.</t842> <t843>“I suppose that boy will be very rich.</t843> <t844>He is not of age yet.</t844> <t845>He will inherit Selby, you know.</t845> <t846>He told me so.</t846> <t847>And… his mother is very beautiful, isn't she?”</t847>
<t848>“Margaret Devereux was one of the most delightful creatures I have ever seen, Harry.</t848> <t849>What on earth could have induced her to behave as she did, I can never understand.</t849> <t850>She could have married anyone she chose.</t850> <t851>Carlington was madly in love with her.</t851> <t852>She was dreamy, that's it.</t852> <t853>All the women in that family are.</t853> <t854>The men are a poor lot, but, my God! the women are wonderful.</t854> <t855>Carlington crawled on his knees to her.</t855> <t856>He himself told me so.</t856> <t857>She laughed at him, yet there wasn't a girl in London at that time who wouldn't have pursued him.</t857> <t858>By the way, Harry, speaking of foolish marriages, what is this nonsense your father told me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American?</t858> <t859>Isn't an English girl good enough for him?”</t859>
<t860>“Marrying an American is quite fashionable nowadays, Uncle George.”</t860>
<t861>“I would bet on English women against the whole world, Harry,” Lord Fermor said, pounding his fist on the table.</t861>
<t862>“The bets are pouring in on the American women's side.”</t862>
<t863>“They won't last, I heard,” he grumbled.</t863>
<t864>“The long-term binding exhausts them, but they excel in the steeplechase.</t864> <t865>They soar over the obstacles.</t865> <t866>I don't think Dartmoor stands a chance.”</t866>
<t867>"Who is her family?" the old man grumbled.</t867> <t868>"Does she have anyone?"</t868>
<t869>Lord Henry shook his head. "American girls are just as good at hiding things from their parents as English women are at hiding their past," he said as he stood up to leave.</t869>
<t870>“They are pork traders, don't you think so?”</t870>
<t871>“I hope so, Uncle George, for the sake of Dartmoor.</t871> <t872>I've heard that pork trading is the most profitable business in America, second only to politics.”</t872>
<t873>“Is she pretty?”</t873>
<t874>“She acts as if she is very beautiful.</t874> <t875>Most American women do that.</t875> <t876>That is the secret of their charm.”</t876>
<t877>“Why can't those American women stay in their own country?</t877> <t878>They always tell us that it is a paradise for women.”</t878>
<t879>“It is indeed so.</t879> <t880>That is why, like Eve, they are so eager to escape from it,” said Lord Henry.</t880> <t881>“Goodbye, Uncle George.</t881> <t882>I will be late for lunch if I stay any longer.</t882> <t883>Thank you for giving me the information I needed.</t883> <t884>I always want to know everything about new friends, and everything about old friends.”</t884>
<t885>"Where did you have lunch, Harry?"</t885>
<t886>"At Aunt Agatha's place."</t886> <t887>"I requested for myself and Mr. Gray. He is her latest protégé."</t887>
<t888>1 Sponsored person.</t888>
<t889>“Hmph! Tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with her charity appeals.</t889> <t890>I'm sick of them.</t890> <t891>Why does that good woman think I have nothing better to do than write checks for her whimsical nonsense.”</t891>
<t892>“Alright, Uncle George, I will tell her, but it won't make any difference.</t892> <t893>Kind-hearted people often lose all sense of humanity.</t893> <t894>That is their most prominent characteristic.</t894><t895>”</t895>
<t896>The old man muttered in agreement and rang the bell to call the servant.</t896> <t897>Lord Henry walked through the low-arched passage leading to Burlington Street, then turned towards Berkeley Square.</t897>
<t898>So that is the story of Dorian Gray's lineage. As blunt as it was told to him, it stirred his heart with the suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance.</t898> <t899>A beautiful woman had risked everything for her mad passion.</t899> <t900>A few weeks of wild happiness cut short by a hideous, deceitful crime.</t900> <t901>Months of silent suffering, then a child born in pain.</t901> <t902>The mother kidnapped by death, the boy left in loneliness and the cruelty of a heartless old man.</t902> <t903>Yes; it was an interesting background.</t903> <t904>It elevated the young man, made him seem more perfect.</t904> <t905>Behind everything beautiful that has ever existed, there must be something tragic.</t905> <t906>The world must endure the pain of childbirth, so that even the most ordinary flower can bloom… And how enchanting he was at dinner the night before, when, with frightened eyes and lips parted in dreadful joy, he sat opposite him in the club, the red lampshade casting a deeper crimson on his awakened astonishment.</t906> <t907>Talking to him was like playing on a finely tuned violin.</t907> <t908>He responded to every touch and vibration of the bow…</t908> <t909>There was something irresistibly fascinating about exerting influence.</t909> <t910>No other activity was quite like it.</t910> <t911>To project one's soul into a graceful form, and let it linger there for a while; to hear one's own intellectual views echoed back with all the added music of passion and youth; to transmit one's temperament through another as if it were some magical fluid or strange perfume; there was a very real pleasure in it — perhaps the most satisfying pleasure left to us in an age as limited and coarse as ours, an age utterly mundane in its pleasures, utterly mediocre in its aims… He, the young man whom by a strange chance he had met in Basil's studio, was also an extraordinary model; or could be made into an extraordinary model, in any case.</t911> <t912>Grace was his, along with the pure innocence of youth, and beauty like that which the ancient Greek marble statues have preserved for us.</t912> <t913>There was nothing that could not be done with him.</t913> <t914>He could be crafted into a giant or a toy.</t914> <t915>How tragic it was that such beauty should be destined to fade!...</t915> <t916>And Basil? How interesting he was from a psychological perspective!</t916> <t917>A fresh artistic style, a new outlook on life, strangely inspired merely by the visible presence of someone completely unaware of it; a quiet soul still dwelling in the dim forest, still walking invisibly in the open field, suddenly revealing itself, like a fearless forest goddess, because in his soul, the one who sought her there, had awakened the extraordinary imagination that before only it could reveal the extraordinary; the mere form and pattern of those things had, so to speak, become essential, and achieved a kind of symbolic value, even though they were models of a different and more perfect form whose shadow they had made real: how strange all this was!</t917> <t918>He recalled something similar in history.</t918> <t919>Was it Plato, that artist of thought, who first analyzed it?</t919> <t920>Was it Buonarotti, who carved it into the colored marble of a sonnet sequence?</t920> <t921>But in our century, it was truly strange… Yes; he would try to become, to Dorian Gray, what that young man, unknowingly, had become to the artist who created that marvelous portrait.</t921> <t922>He would seek to dominate him — in fact, he had almost done so already. He would make that extraordinary soul his own.</t922> <t923>There was something truly enchanting about this child of Love and Death.</t923>
<t924>Suddenly, he stopped and looked up at the houses.</t924> <t925>He realized that he had walked past his aunt's house by several blocks, and, smiling to himself, turned back.</t925> <t926>When he stepped into the somewhat gloomy hall, the butler informed him that they had already gone to eat.</t926> <t927>He handed his hat and cane to a servant, then went into the dining room.</t927>
<t928>“Late again as always, Harry,” his aunt yelled, shaking her head at him.</t928>
<t929>Y came up with a plausible excuse to justify himself, and sat down in the empty seat next to his aunt, looking around to see who was there.</t929> <t930>Dorian shyly bowed his head in greeting from the other end of the table, a slight flush of joy creeping up his cheeks.</t930> <t931>Opposite him was the Duchess of Harley; a kind-hearted and good-natured lady, esteemed by all her acquaintances, and possessing a fertile architectural symmetry that in women who are not duchesses is still described by contemporary historians with the word "obese".</t931> <t932>Sitting next to her, on her right, was Sir Thomas Burdon, a member of the Radical Party, a Member of Parliament, who followed his leader in public life, but in private life followed the best chefs, dined with Conservatives, thought with Liberals, adhering to a wise and famous rule.</t932> <t933>The position on her left was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, a rather charming and cultured elderly gentleman, who nevertheless had acquired the bad habit of silence because, as he once explained to Mrs. Agatha, he had said everything he needed to say before he was thirty.</t933> <t934>Next to him was Lady Vandeleur, one of his aunt's oldest friends, a perfect angel among women, but dressed so terribly that she reminded people of a poorly bound hymn book.</t934> <t935>Fortunately for him, sitting on the other side of her was Lord Faudel, an extraordinarily intelligent middle-aged man, as bald as a minister's speech in the House of Commons, with whom she conversed in that eager, lively manner that, as he once noted to himself, was an unforgivable fault that all truly kind-hearted people fell into and from which none of them ever fully escaped.</t935>
<t936>“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” the duchess exclaimed, nodding warmly at him across the table.</t936> <t937>“Do you think he will really marry this charming young girl?”</t937>
<t938>“I believe she has decided to propose to him, Your Grace.</t938><t939>”</t939>
<t940>“How terrifying!” Mrs. Agatha exclaimed. “Someone really should intervene.</t940><t941>”</t941>
<t942>"I heard, according to a very reliable source, that her father manages a grocery store in America," said Mr. Thomas Burdon, looking disdainful.</t942>
<t943>“My uncle hypothesized that it was pork trading, Sir Thomas.</t943><t944>”</t944>
<t945>“General store! What is an American general store?” the duchess asked, raising her large hands in surprise, and emphasizing the verb.</t945>
<t946>“American novels,” Lord Henry replied, helping himself to a bit of quail.</t946>
<t947>The duchess seemed confused.</t947>
<t948>"Don't pay attention to it, my friend," whispered Mrs. Agatha.</t948> <t949>"It is never serious about what it says."</t949>
<t950>“When America was discovered,” the member of the Radical party said, and he began to present some tedious facts.</t950> <t951>Like anyone who tries to exhaust a topic, he also exhausted his listeners.</t951> <t952>The Duchess sighed and used her privilege to interrupt. “I only wish it had never been discovered at all!” she exclaimed. “Truly, our girls nowadays have no chance.</t952> <t953>It is so terribly unfair.</t953><t954>”</t954>
<t955>“Perhaps in the end, America was never actually discovered,” Mr. Erskine said.</t955> <t956>“I always say it was merely recognized.”</t956>
<t957>“Oh! But I have seen a few of those types of people,” the duchess replied, very carelessly.</t957> <t958>“I must admit that most of them are extremely charming.</t958> <t959>And they dress well too.</t959> <t960>They buy all their clothes in Paris. I wish I could afford to do that.”</t960>
<t961>“They say that when good Americans die, they go to Paris,” Sir Thomas chuckled, he had a large wardrobe full of discarded Humor.</t961>
<t962>“Really! So where do bad Americans go when they die?” the duchess inquired.</t962> <t963>“They go to America,” Lord Henry whispered.</t963>
<t964>Sir Thomas frowned.</t964> <t965>“I’m afraid your grandson has a prejudice against that great country,” he said to Mrs. Agatha.</t965> <t966>“I have traveled everywhere there, in carriages meticulously arranged by directors, who, in such matters, are extremely polite.</t966> <t967>I assure you that visiting that place is an education in itself.”</t967>
<t968>“But do we really need to see Chicago to be educated?” Mr. Erskine asked again, gloomily.</t968> <t969>“I don't feel up to that journey.”</t969>
<t970>Sir Thomas waved his hand. "Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the whole world on his bookshelf.</t970> <t971>Practical people like us prefer to see things rather than just read about them.</t971> <t972>Americans are an extremely interesting people.</t972> <t973>They are absolutely rational. I think that is their most prominent characteristic.</t973> <t974>Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely rational people.</t974> <t975>I assure you there is nothing irrational about Americans at all."</t975>
<t976>“How terrifying!” exclaimed Lord Henry. “I can resist brute force, but brute reason is truly unbearable.</t976> <t977>There is something deceitful in its use.</t977> <t978>It strikes below the intellect.</t978><t979>”</t979>
<t980>“I don't understand you,” Mr. Thomas said, his face becoming quite red.</t980>
<t981>“I understand, Lord Henry,” Mr. Erskine muttered, with a smile.</t981>
<t982>“Paradoxes are all very interesting in their own way…” the young baron replied.</t982>
<t983>“Is that a paradox?” Mr. Erskine asked.</t983> <t984>“I don't think so.</t984> <t985>Maybe it is. Well, the path of paradox is the path of truth.</t985> <t986>To test Reality, we must see it on a tightrope.</t986> <t987>When Truths become acrobats, then we can judge them.”</t987>
<t988>"Oh my God!" said Mrs. Agatha, "you men love to argue so much!</t988> <t989>I'm sure I'll never be able to understand what you are talking about.</t989> <t990>Ah! Harry, I am quite displeased with you.</t990> <t991>Why are you trying to persuade our handsome Mr. Dorian Gray to leave East End?</t991> <t992>I assure you he will be truly invaluable.</t992> <t993>They really enjoy having him play."</t993>
<t994>“I want him to play for me,” Lord Henry exclaimed, laughing, then he looked down to the other end of the table and met a bright, responsive gaze.</t994>
<t995>“But they are very miserable in Whitechapel,” Mrs. Agatha continued.</t995>
<t996>“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord Henry, shrugging his shoulders.</t996> <t997>“I cannot sympathize with that.</t997> <t998>It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing.</t998> <t999>There is something terribly morbid about modern sympathy with pain.</t999> <t1000>One should sympathize with color, beauty, the joy of life.</t1000> <t1001>The less said about the sorrows and woes of life, the better.”</t1001>
<t1002>“However, the East End is a serious matter,” Sir Thomas remarked, with a solemn shake of his head.</t1002>
<t1003>“That's right,” the young lord replied. “It's a matter of slavery, and we try to solve it by entertaining the slaves.”</t1003>
<t1004>The politician looked at him sharply. "So what changes do you propose, huh?" he asked.</t1004>
<t1005>Lord Henry laughed.</t1005> <t1006>“I do not wish to change anything in England except the weather,” he replied.</t1006> <t1007>“I am quite satisfied with philosophical contemplation.</t1007> <t1008>But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt from overspending on sympathy, I suggest that we should appeal to Science to bring us back to the right path.</t1008> <t1009>The advantage of emotions is that they lead us astray, while the advantage of Science is that it has no emotions.”</t1009>
<t1010>“But I bear very grave responsibilities,” Mrs. Vandeleur ventured, shyly.</t1010>
<t1011>"Terribly serious," Mrs. Agatha repeated.</t1011>
<t1012>Lord Henry glanced at Mr. Erskine.</t1012> <t1013>"Human beings consider themselves too important.</t1013> <t1014>That is the original sin of the world.</t1014> <t1015>If the cave dwellers had known how to laugh, history would have been different."</t1015>
<t1016>“You really know how to comfort someone,” the duchess whispered. “I always feel quite guilty whenever I visit your aunt, because I don't care at all about the East End.</t1016> <t1017>From now on, I can look her in the eye without blushing.”</t1017>
<t1018>“Blushing suits you very well too, madam duchess,” Lord Henry remarked.</t1018>
<t1019>“Only when one is still young,” she replied.</t1019> <t1020>“When an old lady like me blushes, it is a very bad sign.</t1020> <t1021>Ah, Lord Henry, I wish you could show me how to become young again.</t1021><t1022>”</t1022>
<t1023>He thought for a moment.</t1023> <t1024>“Can you remember any major mistake you made in the early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across the table.</t1024>
<t1025>“A lot, I'm afraid so,” she exclaimed.</t1025>
<t1026>"Then commit them again," he said, solemnly.</t1026> <t1027>"To return to youth, one only needs to repeat their own follies."</t1027>
<t1028>“An interesting theory!” she exclaimed.</t1028> <t1029>“I must apply it in practice.</t1029><t1030>”</t1030>
<t1031>"A dangerous theory!" came from the tightly pressed lips of Mr. Thomas.</t1031> <t1032>Mrs. Agatha shook her head but couldn't help laughing.</t1032> <t1033>Mr. Erskine listened.</t1033>
<t1034>“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the greatest secrets of life.</t1034> <t1035>Nowadays most people die of a creeping common sense, and discover too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.”</t1035>
<t1036>A burst of laughter ran around the table.</t1036>
<t1037>He toyed with that idea, and gradually became obstinate; tossing it into the air and transforming it; letting it escape and then catching it again; making it shine brilliantly with imagination, then giving it wings with paradox.</t1037> <t1038>The praise of madness, as he continued, soared to the heights of philosophy, while Philosophy itself became youthful, catching the frenzied music of Pleasure, wearing, we might imagine, a wine-stained robe, crowned with ivy, dancing like a Bacchante across the hills of life, mocking the slow old god Silenus for not being drunk.</t1038> <t1039>Truths rushed past her like frightened wild animals.</t1039> <t1040>Her pure white feet trampled the enormous press on which wise Omar sat, until the fermenting grape juice rose around her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the steep, black, drenched sides of the vat.</t1040> <t1041>It was an extraordinary improvisation.</t1041> <t1042>He felt that Dorian Gray's eyes were fixed on him, and the awareness that among his audience there was someone possessing the temperament he wished to mesmerize seemed to sharpen his intellect and add color to his imagination.</t1042> <t1043>He was talented, eccentric, irresponsible.</t1043> <t1044>He lured his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe laughing.</t1044> <t1045>Dorian Gray never took his eyes off him, but sat like one enchanted, smiles chasing each other on his lips, and wonder slowly turning to solemnity in his darkening eyes.</t1045>
<t1046>Finally, wearing the uniform of the era, Reality stepped into the room disguised as a servant to inform the duchess that her carriage was waiting.</t1046><t1047>She twisted her hands, pretending to be disappointed.</t1047><t1048>“How boring!” she exclaimed. “I have to go. I have to drop by to meet my husband at the club to take him to some silly meeting at Willis's rooms, where he will be presiding.</t1048><t1049>If I am late, he will surely be furious, and I can't argue while wearing this beret.</t1049><t1050>It's too delicate.</t1050><t1051>A harsh word could ruin it.</t1051><t1052>No, I must go, dear Agatha.</t1052><t1053>Goodbye, Lord Henry, you are truly amusing, and so very decadent.</t1053><t1054>I certainly don't know what to say about your views.</t1054><t1055>You must come to dine with us some evening.</t1055><t1056>Tuesday?</t1056><t1057>Are you free on Tuesday?”</t1057>
<t1058>"For you, I could abandon anyone, Your Grace," Lord Henry said, with a bow.</t1058>
<t1059>"Ah! That is very charming and also very wrong on your part," she exclaimed; "so remember that;" and she quickly glided out of the room, followed by Mrs. Agatha and the other ladies.</t1059>
<t1060>When Lord Henry sat down again, Mr. Erskine walked around, brought a chair close to him, and placed his hand on his arm.</t1060>
<t1061>“You say books fall short,” he said; “why don't you write one?”</t1061>
<t1062>“I am too fond of reading books to care about writing them, Mr. Erskine.</t1062> <t1063>I like writing novels, of course; a novel as lovely as a Persian carpet, and just as unreal.</t1063> <t1064>But there is no literary market in England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopedias.</t1064> <t1065>Of all the peoples in the world, the English have the least ability to appreciate the beauty of literature.</t1065><t1066>”</t1066>
<t1067>“I'm afraid you are right,” Mr. Erskine replied.</t1067> <t1068>“I once had literary aspirations myself, but I set them aside long ago.</t1068> <t1069>And now, my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you that, may I ask if you were truly serious about everything you said to us at lunch?”</t1069>
<t1070>“I have completely forgotten what I said,” Lord Henry laughed.</t1070> <t1071>“Were they all bad?”</t1071>
<t1072>“Very bad indeed.</t1072> <t1073>In fact, I consider you extremely dangerous, and if anything happens to our kind duchess, we will all look at you as the main person responsible.</t1073> <t1074>But I want to discuss life with you.</t1074> <t1075>The generation in which I was born is very boring.</t1075> <t1076>One day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and explain to me your philosophy of pleasure while enjoying some excellent Burgundy wine that I am fortunate to possess.”</t1076>
<t1077>"I will be very delighted."</t1077> <t1078>"A visit to Treadley must be a great privilege."</t1078> <t1079>"A place with a perfect host, and a perfect library."</t1079>
<t1080>“I will complete it to make it perfect,” the old man replied, with a polite bow. “And now I must say goodbye to your wonderful aunt.</t1080> <t1081>I have to go to the literary club.</t1081> <t1082>This is the time when we sleep there.”</t1082>
<t1083>“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”</t1083>
<t1084>“Forty of us, in forty armchairs.</t1084> <t1085>We are training to establish a British Academy of Literature.”</t1085>
<t1086>Lord Henry laughed and stood up.</t1086> <t1087>"I'm going to the park," he exclaimed.</t1087>
<t1088>As he walked past the door, Dorian Gray touched his arm.</t1088> <t1089>"Let me go with you," he whispered.</t1089>
<t1090>“But I thought you promised Basil Hallward to go see him,” Lord Henry replied.</t1090>
<t1091>“I prefer to go with you; yes, I feel I must go with you.</t1091> <t1092>Please allow me.</t1092> <t1093>And will you promise to talk to me all the time? No one speaks as well as you.”</t1093>
<t1094>"Ah! I've said quite enough for today already," Lord Henry said with a laugh.</t1094> <t1095>"All I want now is to observe life.</t1095> <t1096>You can come and observe it with me, if you like.</t1096><t1097>"</t1097>
<t1098>Chapter 4</t1098>
<t1099>One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray sat resting on a luxurious armchair in the small library at Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.</t1099> <t1100>It was a very charming room, in its own way, with wainscoting of olive-stained oak panels, cream-colored pilasters, and a ceiling adorned with plaster reliefs, while the dusty-brick colored carpet was covered with long-fringed Persian silk rugs.</t1100> <t1101>On the tiny lacquered table stood a small Clodion statue, and next to it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound by Clovis Eve for Margaret of Valois, decorated with gilded daisies that the Queen herself had chosen for her emblem.</t1101> <t1102>Several large blue porcelain vases with parrot tulips lined the mantelpiece, and through the tiny leaded panes of the window streamed the ripe-apricot light of a London summer day.</t1102>
<t1103>The lord has not yet returned.</t1103> <t1104>He is always late by principle, his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.</t1104> <t1105>As a result, the young man seemed quite sulky, while he used his indifferent fingers to flip through the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he found on one of the bookshelves.</t1105> <t1106>The monotonous ticking of the Louis XIV clock annoyed him.</t1106> <t1107>A couple of times he thought about leaving.</t1107>
<t1108>Finally, he heard footsteps outside, and the door opened. "Why are you so late, Harry!" he muttered.</t1108>
<t1109>“I'm afraid it's not Harry, Mr. Gray,” a shrill voice replied.</t1109>
<t1110>He quickly looked around and sat up.</t1110> <t1111>"I'm sorry.</t1111> <t1112>I thought..."</t1112>
<t1113>“You thought I was my husband.</t1113> <t1114>But I am just his wife.</t1114> <t1115>You should let me introduce myself.</t1115> <t1116>I know you quite well from your photos.</t1116> <t1117>I think my husband has seventeen of them in total.”</t1117>
<t1118>“Isn't it seventeen, Miss Henry?”</t1118>
<t1119>“Ah, eighteen, that's it.</t1119> <t1120>And I saw you with him the other night at the opera house.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and looked at him with absent-minded glassy eyes.</t1120> <t1121>She was a curious woman, her clothes always looked as if they were designed in a frenzy and worn in a storm.</t1121> <t1122>She often fell in love with someone, and, since her affections were never reciprocated, she retained all her illusions.</t1122> <t1123>She tried to appear impressive, but only succeeded in becoming shabby and unkempt.</t1123> <t1124>Her name was Victoria, and she was insanely addicted to going to church.</t1124>
<t1125>“I think it was at the Lohengrin performance, wasn't it, Miss Henry?”</t1125>
<t1126>“Yes; it is because of dear Lohengrin.</t1126> <t1127>I prefer Wagner's music over anyone else's.</t1127> <t1128>It is so loud that we can talk the whole time without anyone else hearing what we say.</t1128> <t1129>That is a great advantage of it: don't you think so, Mr. Gray?”</t1129>
<t1130>The same nervous, abrupt laugh escaped from her thin lips, and her fingers began to play with a long paper knife made of tortoiseshell.</t1130>
<t1131>Dorin smiled and shook his head: "I'm afraid I don't think so, Miss Henry."</t1131> <t1132>"I never talk while listening to music, at least not when the music is good."</t1132> <t1133>"If someone has to listen to bad music, it's their duty to drown it out with conversation."</t1133>
<t1134>“Aha! That is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray?</t1134><t1135>I always hear Harry's views from his friends.</t1135><t1136>That's the only way I am familiar with them.</t1136><t1137>But you shouldn't think that I don't like good music.</t1137><t1138>I love it, but I fear it.</t1138><t1139>It makes me too dreamy.</t1139><t1140>I just adore pianists — two at a time, sometimes, that's what Harry tells me.</t1140><t1141>I don't know what it is about them.</t1141><t1142>Perhaps it's because they are foreigners.</t1142><t1143>They all are, aren't they? Even those born in England become foreigners after a while, don't they?</t1143><t1144>That is very wise of them, and quite a compliment to the art.</t1144><t1145>Making it belong to the whole world, right?</t1145><t1146>You have never attended any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray? You should come.</t1146><t1147>I can't afford orchids, but I don't mind spending on foreigners.</t1147><t1148>They make the room look as pretty as a picture.</t1148><t1149>But here is Harry! — Harry, I came to find you, to ask you something — I forgot what it was — and I found Mr. Gray here.</t1149><t1150>We have been having a delightful conversation about music.</t1150><t1151>We have exactly the same ideas.</t1151><t1152>No; I think our ideas are completely different.</t1152><t1153>But he is extremely pleasant.</t1153><t1154>I am so glad I met him.”</t1154>
<t1155>“I am very delighted, my love, very delighted,” Lord Henry said, raising his crescent-shaped black eyebrows and looking at both of them with a joyful smile.</t1155> <t1156>“I am very sorry for being late, Dorian.</t1156> <t1157>I went to see an old gold-embroidered tapestry on Wardour Street, and had to bargain for a few hours for it.</t1157> <t1158>Nowadays people know the price of everything but the value of nothing.”</t1158>
<t1159>"I'm afraid I have to go," Miss Henry exclaimed, breaking the awkward silence with her sudden silly laughter.</t1159> <t1160>"I promised to ride with the duchess."</t1160> <t1161>"Goodbye, Mr. Gray. Goodbye, Harry. I think you're going out to eat, aren't you? So am I."</t1161> <t1162>"Maybe I'll see you at Mrs. Thornbury's."</t1162>
<t1163>“Probably, my dear,” Lord Henry said, closing the door behind her, as she, looking like a bird of paradise that had spent the whole night in the rain, darted out of the room, leaving behind a faint scent of frangipani.</t1163> <t1164>After that, he lit a cigarette and sank into the sofa.</t1164>
<t1165>"Never marry a woman with straw-colored hair, Dorian," he said, after a few short breaths.</t1165>
<t1166>"Why is that, Harry?"</t1166>
<t1167>"Because they are very sentimental."</t1167>
<t1168>“But I like sentimental people.”</t1168>
<t1169>"Don't get married at all, Dorian.</t1169> <t1170>Men marry because they are tired; women because they are curious; both are disappointed.</t1170><t1171>"</t1171>
<t1172>"I don't think I could ever get married, Henry.</t1172> <t1173>I am too heavily in love.</t1173> <t1174>That is one of your maxims. I have practiced it, as I always do with everything you say.</t1174><t1175>"</t1175>
<t1176>"Who do you love?" Lord Henry asked, after a moment of silence.</t1176>
<t1177>“An actress,” Dorian Gray said, blushing.</t1177>
<t1178>Lord Henry shrugged. "That was a rather mediocre début.</t1178><t1179>"</t1179>
<t1180>"You probably wouldn't say that if you had seen her, Harry."</t1180>
<t1181>"Who is she?"</t1181>
<t1182>"Her name is Sibyl Vane."</t1182>
<t1183>“Never heard of her.”</t1183>
<t1184>“No one ever has.</t1184> <t1185>But everyone will, one day.</t1185> <t1186>She is a genius.”</t1186>
<t1187>“My dear boy, there are no girls who are geniuses.</t1187> <t1188>Girls are the gender meant for display.</t1188> <t1189>They never have anything to say, but they speak very charmingly.</t1189> <t1190>Girls represent the triumph of matter over spirit, just as boys represent the triumph of spirit over morality.”</t1190>
<t1191>"Harry, how could you?"</t1191>
<t1192>“My dear Dorian, it is indeed so.</t1192> <t1193>I am analyzing women, so I should know.</t1193> <t1194>The subject is not as difficult to understand as I thought.</t1194> <t1195>I have discovered that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, monochromatic and polychromatic.</t1195> <t1196>Monochromatic women are very useful.</t1196> <t1197>If you want to appear respectable, you just need to take them out to dinner.</t1197> <t1198>The other type of women are very charming.</t1198> <t1199>However, they make one mistake.</t1199> <t1200>They wear makeup to try to look youthful.</t1200> <t1201>Our grandmothers wore makeup to try to speak well.</t1201> <t1202>Powder and wit used to go together.</t1202> <t1203>Now that is a thing of the past.</t1203> <t1204>As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her daughter, she is content.</t1204> <t1205>For conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and two of them cannot be admitted into polite society.</t1205> <t1206>However, tell me about your genius.</t1206> <t1207>Have you known her long?”</t1207>
<t1208>“Oh! Harry, your perspective frightens me.</t1208><t1209>”</t1209>
<t1210>"Don't pay attention to it."</t1210> <t1211>"Have you known her for long?"</t1211>
<t1212>"About three weeks."</t1212>
<t1213>"And where did you run into her?"</t1213>
<t1214>“I will tell you, Harry; but you must not be prejudiced against it.</t1214> <t1215>After all, it probably would never have happened if I hadn't met you.</t1215> <t1216>You made me feel a longing to know everything about life.</t1216> <t1217>For many days after I met you, something seemed to be throbbing in my veins.</t1217> <t1218>When I wandered aimlessly in the Park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I often looked at each person who passed me by, and wondered, with a mad curiosity, what kind of life they were living.</t1218> <t1219>Some of them fascinated me.</t1219> <t1220>Others made me feel afraid.</t1220> <t1221>There was some subtle poison in the air.</t1221> <t1222>I was enamored with strong emotions...</t1222> <t1223>So, one evening, around seven o'clock, I decided to go out and seek some adventure.</t1223> <t1224>I felt that our gray, gigantic city of London, with its myriad people, with its petty criminals, with its enthralling sins, as you once put it, must have something in store for me.</t1224> <t1225>I imagined a thousand things.</t1225> <t1226>The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I remembered what you had said to me on that marvelous afternoon when we first dined together, that ‘the search for beauty is the true secret of life.’</t1226> <t1227>I didn't know what I was waiting for, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon getting lost in a maze of grimy streets and dark squares without a blade of grass.</t1227> <t1228>Around half-past eight, I passed a ridiculous little theater, with great blazing gas lamps and gaudy posters.</t1228> <t1229>A hideous Jew, wearing the most astonishing waistcoat I had ever seen in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.</t1229> <t1230>He had greasy ringlets and a huge diamond blazing in the center of his soiled shirt.</t1230> <t1231>“Take a box, my lord?” he said, when he saw me, and took off his hat with a florid servility.</t1231> <t1232>There was something about him, Harry, that amused me. He was indeed a monster.</t1232> <t1233>You will laugh at me, I know, but I actually went in and paid a whole guinea for a box near the stage.</t1233> <t1234>To this day I cannot understand why I did it; yet if I hadn't —</t1234> <t1235>My dear Harry, if I hadn't, I would have missed the greatest romance of my life.</t1235> <t1236>I see you laughing.</t1236> <t1237>You are outrageous.</t1237>
<t1238>“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.</t1238> <t1239>But you should not talk about the greatest romantic affair of your life.</t1239> <t1240>You should talk about the first romantic affair of your life.</t1240> <t1241>You will always be loved, and you will always fall in love with your lover.</t1241> <t1242>A grande passion1 is the privilege of those who have nothing to do.</t1242> <t1243>It is a benefit of the idle classes of a nation.</t1243>
<t1244>1 A great passion.</t1244>
<t1245>Don't be afraid.</t1245> <t1246>There are wonderful things already prepared for you.</t1246> <t1247>This is just the beginning."</t1247>
<t1248>"Do you think that I am very shallow by nature?" Dorian Gray shouted, angry.</t1248>
<t1249>“No; I think your nature is very secretive.</t1249><t1250>”</t1250>
<t1251>“What do you mean?”</t1251>
<t1252>“My dear boy, the person who loves only once in their life is truly shallow.</t1252> <t1253>What they call fidelity and honesty, I call a state of habitual coma or a lack of imagination.</t1253> <t1254>Loyalty in the realm of emotions is akin to consistency in the realm of intellect — simply an admission of failure.</t1254> <t1255>Loyalty!</t1255> <t1256>I will have to analyze it someday.</t1256> <t1257>The desire for possession lies within it.</t1257> <t1258>There are many things we would surely discard if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.</t1258> <t1259>But I don't want to interrupt you.</t1259> <t1260>Continue with your story.”</t1260>
<t1261>"Then I found myself sitting in a dreadfully small private box, with a crude curtain hanging blatantly in front of me.</t1261> <t1262>I peeked out from behind the curtain and observed the theater.</t1262> <t1263>It was a gaudy affair, full of cupids and goat horns adorned with fruits, like a third-rate wedding cake.</t1263> <t1264>The gallery and the second tier were quite full, but the two rows of drab seats in front of the stage were completely empty, and there was hardly anyone in what I think they call the balcony.</t1264> <t1265>Women were walking around with oranges and ginger beer, and there was an enormous consumption of nuts taking place."</t1265>
<t1266>“Surely it is just like the glorious days of English Theatre.”</t1266>
<t1267>“Exactly the same, I think so, and very boring.</t1267> <t1268>When I started to wonder what the heck I should do, I suddenly saw the advertisement poster.</t1268> <t1269>What do you think the play was called, Harry?”</t1269>
<t1270>“I think it is ‘The Foolish Boy, or Silly but Innocent.’</t1270> <t1271>Our ancestors often liked this type of work, I believe so.</t1271> <t1272>The longer I live, Dorian, the more deeply I feel that whatever was good enough for our ancestors is not good enough for us.</t1272> <t1273>In art, as in politics, les grandpères ont toujours tort1."</t1273>
<t1274>1 A detail from Hamlet.</t1274>
<t1275>“This play is good enough for me, Harry.</t1275> <t1276>It is Romeo and Juliet.</t1276> <t1277>I must confess that I was quite annoyed with the idea of watching Shakespeare performed in such a shabby, miserable nook.</t1277> <t1278>However, I still found it somewhat interesting.</t1278> <t1279>Anyway, I decided to wait for the first act.</t1279> <t1280>There was a dreadful band, kept in tune by a young Hebrew man sitting by a broken piano, which almost drove me away, but finally the curtain rose, and the play began.</t1280> <t1281>Romeo was a fat old man, with eyebrows blackened with burnt cork, a hoarse tragic voice, and a body like a beer barrel.</t1281> <t1282>Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by a low comedian, who inserted his own jokes and had a very friendly relationship with the second-class audience.</t1282> <t1283>Both of them were as ridiculous as the scenery, which looked as if it had appeared in a country fair theater.</t1283> <t1284>But Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, just seventeen years old, with a small face as fresh as a flower, a Greek-style head, with dark brown braided hair, eyes like wells of passionate violet, lips like rose petals.</t1284> <t1285>She is the most lovely creature I have ever seen in my life.</t1285> <t1286>You once told me that pathos does not move you, but that beauty, only beauty, could bring tears to your eyes.</t1286> <t1287>I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl because of the veil of tears that came across me.</t1287> <t1288>And her voice — I have never heard a voice like that.</t1288> <t1289>At first it was very soft, with deep sweet notes, as if each one was being poured into your ear.</t1289> <t1290>Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a distant flute or oboe.</t1290> <t1291>In the garden scene, it echoed with all the trembling ecstasy one hears just before dawn when the nightingale sings.</t1291> <t1292>There were moments, later, when it had the wild passion of a violin.</t1292> <t1293>You know how a voice can stir one.</t1293> <t1294>Your voice and Sibyl Vane's voice are the two that I will never forget.</t1294> <t1295>When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each says something different.</t1295> <t1296>I do not know which to follow.</t1296> <t1297>How could I not love her?</t1297> <t1298>Harry, I have loved her.</t1298> <t1299>To me, she is the most important thing in the world.</t1299> <t1300>Night after night, I go to see her perform.</t1300> <t1301>One night she is Rosalind, the next night she is Imogen.</t1301> <t1302>I have seen her die in the dim darkness of an Italian tomb, after sucking the poison from her lover's lips.</t1302> <t1303>I have watched her wander through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in long hose and doublet, wearing a dainty cap.</t1303> <t1304>She has been mad, and has come to a guilty king, giving him rosemary to use, and rue to taste.</t1304> <t1305>She has been innocent, and the black hand of jealousy has strangled her reed-like throat.</t1305> <t1306>I have seen her in every age and in every costume.</t1306> <t1307>Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination.</t1307> <t1308>They are limited to their century.</t1308> <t1309>No mystical charm ever elevates them.</t1309> <t1310>We understand their minds as easily as we understand their bonnets.</t1310> <t1311>We always find them.</t1311> <t1312>There is no mystery in any of them.</t1312> <t1313>They ride in the park in the morning, chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.</t1313> <t1314>They have stereotyped smiles and fashionable manners.</t1314> <t1315>They are quite obvious.</t1315> <t1316>But an actress! How different an actress is! Harry! Why did you not tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?”</t1316>
<t1317>“Because I have loved many of them already, Dorian.”</t1317>
<t1318>“Oh, yes, those scary girls, with dyed hair and painted faces.”</t1318>
<t1319>“Don't criticize dyed hair and painted faces.</t1319> <t1320>There is sometimes a strange charm in them,” Lord Henry said.</t1320>
<t1321>“Now I just wish I hadn't told you about Sibyl Vane.”</t1321>
<t1322>"You can't not tell me, Dorian.</t1322> <t1323>For the rest of your life, you will tell me everything you do."</t1323>
<t1324>“Yes, Harry, I believe that's true.</t1324> <t1325>I can't help but tell you everything.</t1325> <t1326>You have a strange influence on me.</t1326> <t1327>If I ever commit a crime, I would come to confess it to you.</t1327> <t1328>You would understand me.</t1328><t1329>”</t1329>
<t1330>“People like you — the stubborn rays of life — will not commit crimes, Dorian.</t1330> <t1331>But I still very much appreciate the compliment, nonetheless.</t1331> <t1332>Now tell me — pass me the matches, please, thank you: — what is your actual relationship with Sibyl Vane?”</t1332>
<t1333>Dorian Gray jumped up, his cheeks red, his eyes blazing.</t1333> <t1334>"Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!"</t1334>
<t1335>“Only sacred things are worth touching, Dorian,” Lord Henry said, with a strange touch of excitement in his voice.</t1335> <t1336>“But why are you upset?</t1336> <t1337>I suppose she will belong to you one day.</t1337> <t1338>When we love, we always begin by deceiving ourselves, and we always end by deceiving others.</t1338> <t1339>That is what the world calls romance.</t1339> <t1340>You are already acquainted with her, anyway, I think, aren't you?”</t1340>
<t1341>"Of course, I knew her.</t1341> <t1342>On the first night I was at the theater, that dreadful old Jew came by my box after the performance ended and offered to take me backstage and introduce me to her.</t1342> <t1343>I was furious with him, telling him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years, and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona.</t1343> <t1344>From the stunned look on his face, I thought he had the impression that I had drunk too much champagne or was on something."</t1344>
<t1345>“I am not surprised.</t1345><t1346>”</t1346>
<t1347>“Then he asked me if I wrote for any newspaper.</t1347> <t1348>I told him that I had never even read them.</t1348> <t1349>He seemed terribly disappointed by that, and confided in me that all the theater critics were part of a conspiracy against him, and that they were all bought.”</t1349>
<t1350>“I wouldn't be surprised if he was completely right on this point.</t1350> <t1351>But, on the other hand, judging by their appearance, most of them probably aren't worth much either.”</t1351>
<t1352>“Yes, he seems to think they are beyond his capability,” Dorian laughed.</t1352> <t1353>“However, by then the lights in the theater started to go out and I had to leave.</t1353> <t1354>He wanted me to try a few cigars that he enthusiastically recommended.</t1354> <t1355>I refused.</t1355> <t1356>The next night, of course, I went back there.</t1356> <t1357>When he saw me, he bowed deeply to greet me, and assured me that I was a generous patron of the arts.</t1357> <t1358>He was an extremely repulsive brute, yet he harbored a particular passion for Shakespeare.</t1358> <t1359>Once he told me, with a proud look, that his five bankruptcies were all due to the ‘Bard,’ as he insisted on calling him.</t1359> <t1360>He seemed to think it was a mark of respect.”</t1360>
<t1361>“It is an honor, my dear Dorian — a great honor.</t1361> <t1362>Most people go bankrupt from investing too heavily in the struggle for existence.</t1362> <t1363>Going bankrupt because of poetry is a distinction.</t1363> <t1364>But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”</t1364>
<t1365>“The third night. At that time she was playing the role of Rosalind. I couldn't help but go around to the back.</t1365> <t1366>I threw her some flowers, and she looked at me; at least I imagined she did. The old Jew was very persistent.</t1366> <t1367>He seemed determined to follow me, so I agreed.</t1367> <t1368>Isn't it strange that I didn't want to get to know her?”</t1368>
<t1369>"No; I don't think so."</t1369>
<t1370>“My dear Harry, why?”</t1370>
<t1371>“I will tell you another time.</t1371> <t1372>Now I want to know about this girl.”</t1372>
<t1373>“Sibyl? Oh, she is so very shy, so very gentle.</t1373> <t1374>There is something of a child in her.</t1374> <t1375>Her eyes opened wide in utter amazement when I told her what I thought of her performance, and she seemed completely unaware of her own talent.</t1375> <t1376>I think both of us were quite nervous.</t1376> <t1377>The old Jew stood grinning at the entrance to the dusty greenroom, uttering polished phrases about both of us, while we stood looking at each other like children.</t1377> <t1378>He insisted on calling me 'lord,' so I had to assure Sibyl that I had nothing to do with such people.</t1378> <t1379>She told me very simply, 'You look more like a prince.</t1379> <t1380>I should call you Prince Charming.'”</t1380>
<t1381>“I swear on my honor, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to compliment very well.</t1381><t1382>”</t1382>
<t1383>“You don't understand her, Harry. She sees me as just a character in a play.</t1383> <t1384>She knows nothing about life.</t1384> <t1385>She lives with her mother, a weary and withered woman, who plays Lady Capulet wearing a kind of dark crimson cloak on the first night, and looks as if she has seen better days.</t1385><t1386>”</t1386>
<t1387>"I know this look.</t1387> <t1388>It discourages me," Lord Henry muttered, scrutinizing his rings.</t1388>
<t1389>“The old Jew wanted to tell me her background, but I told him I wasn't interested.”</t1389>
<t1390>“You are absolutely right.</t1390> <t1391>There is always something incredibly pathetic about other people's tragedies.</t1391><t1392>”</t1392>
<t1393>“Sibyl is the only thing I care about.</t1393> <t1394>What does it matter to me where she comes from?</t1394> <t1395>From her small head to her tiny feet, she is absolutely and completely divine.</t1395> <t1396>Every night of my life, I go to see her performance, and each night she is more marvelous.</t1396><t1397>”</t1397>
<t1398>“I believe that is the reason why you never go out to dinner with me these days.</t1398> <t1399>I think you must have some strange romantic affair on your hands already.</t1399> <t1400>You did; but it was not what I expected.”</t1400>
<t1401>“My dear Harry, we still have lunch or dinner together every day, and I have been to the opera with you a few times,” Dorian said, opening his wide blue eyes in astonishment.</t1401>
<t1402>“You always arrive terribly late.”</t1402>
<t1403>“Yes, I cannot help but go see Sibyl perform,” he exclaimed, “even if it is just a single act.</t1403> <t1404>I crave her figure; and when I think of the wondrous soul hidden within that petite, exquisite body, my heart is filled with fear.”</t1404>
<t1405>"Can you have dinner with me tonight, Dorian?"</t1405>
<t1406>He shook his head.</t1406> <t1407>"Tonight she is Imogen," he replied, "and tomorrow night she will be Juliet."</t1407>
<t1408>“So when is she Sibyl Vane?”</t1408>
<t1409>"Never."</t1409>
<t1410>"Congratulations to you."</t1410>
<t1411>“Why are you so unreasonable! She is all the great heroines of the world combined into one.</t1411> <t1412>She is more than a single individual.</t1412> <t1413>You laugh, but I tell you: she is a genius.</t1413> <t1414>I love her, and I must make her love me.</t1414> <t1415>You, who know all the secrets of life, show me how to enchant Sibyl Vane so that she loves me!</t1415> <t1416>I want to make Romeo jealous.</t1416> <t1417>I want the past lovers of this world to hear our laughter and become sad.</t1417> <t1418>I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to awaken their ashes in the realm of pain.</t1418> <t1419>God, Harry, why do I adore her so!” He paced back and forth in the room as he spoke.</t1419> <t1420>Feverish red spots burned on his cheeks.</t1420> <t1421>He was terribly agitated.</t1421>
<t1422>Lord Henry observed him with a subtle sense of satisfaction.</t1422> <t1423>How different he was now from the shy, frightened boy he had once met in Basil Hallward's studio! His nature had blossomed like a flower, had bloomed in vivid red.</t1423> <t1424>His soul had slipped out of its secret hiding place, and Desire was on its way to meet it.</t1424>
<t1425>“And what do you intend to do?” Lord Henry said, finally.</t1425>
<t1426>“I want you and Basil to come with me one night to see her perform.</t1426> <t1427>I am not in the least bit afraid of the outcome.</t1427> <t1428>You will surely acknowledge her talent.</t1428> <t1429>After that, we must get her out of that Jew's hands.</t1429> <t1430>She is bound by a contract with him for three years — at least for two years and eight months — from now.</t1430> <t1431>I will have to pay him something, of course.</t1431> <t1432>When everything is settled, I will rent the West End theater and present her properly.</t1432> <t1433>She will drive the whole world crazy as she has done to me.”</t1433>
<t1434>"That is impossible, my boy?"</t1434>
<t1435>"Yes, she will be able to do it.</t1435> <t1436>She not only has art, an exquisite artistic inclination within her, but she also has personality; and he often tells me that it is personality, not principles, that moves the ages."</t1436>
<t1437>“Alright, so which night shall we go?”</t1437>
<t1438>"Let me see.</t1438> <t1439>Today is Tuesday. Let's finalize it for tomorrow.</t1439> <t1440>Tomorrow you will play Juliet."</t1440>
<t1441>“Alright.</t1441> <t1442>Bristol, at eight o'clock; and I will bring Basil along.”</t1442>
<t1443>“Not eight o'clock, Harry, please. Six-thirty. I have to be there before the curtain rises.</t1443> <t1444>You have to see her in the first act, when she meets Romeo.”</t1444>
<t1445>“Six-thirty! What kind of time is this!</t1445> <t1446>It's no different than having meat tea or reading an English novel. It has to be seven o'clock.</t1446> <t1447>No decent person has dinner before seven o'clock.</t1447> <t1448>Will you meet Basil between this hour and the next? Or should I write to him?”</t1448>
<t1449>"Dear Basil! I haven't laid eyes on him all week."</t1449> <t1450>"It's a bit excessive on my part, as he sent me my portrait in a beautiful frame, specially designed by himself, and, although I'm a bit jealous of the painting for being a whole month younger than me, I must admit I am delighted with it."</t1450> <t1451>"Perhaps it's better if you write to him."</t1451> <t1452>"I don't want to meet him alone."</t1452> <t1453>"He will say things that annoy me."</t1453> <t1454>"He keeps giving me good advice."</t1454>
<t1455>Lord Henry laughed.</t1455> <t1456>"People love to give away what they need most themselves.</t1456> <t1457>That is what I call the height of generosity.</t1457><t1458>"</t1458>
<t1459>“Oh, Basil is the best friend, but to me, he seems a bit old-fashioned.</t1459> <t1460>Since I met you, Harry, I have realized that.”</t1460>
<t1461>“Basil, my dear boy, has put all his charm into his work.</t1461> <t1462>As a result, he has nothing left to live on but prejudices, principles, and intellect.</t1462> <t1463>The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists.</t1463> <t1464>A good artist lives wholly in what he creates, and consequently has no life in anything else.</t1464> <t1465>A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures.</t1465> <t1466>But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating.</t1466> <t1467>The worse their rhymes, the more picturesque they look.</t1467> <t1468>The mere fact of having published a second-rate sonnet makes a man quite irresistible.</t1468> <t1469>He lives the poetry that he cannot write.</t1469> <t1470>The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”</t1470>
<t1471>“I wonder if that is really true, Harry?” Dorian Gray said, dabbing some perfume on his handkerchief from a rather large gold-capped bottle that was still on the table.</t1471> <t1472>“It must be, if you say so.</t1472> <t1473>Now I must go.</t1473> <t1474>Imogen is waiting for me.</t1474> <t1475>Don't forget about tomorrow.</t1475> <t1476>Goodbye.”</t1476>
<t1477>When he left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to think.</t1477> <t1478>Surely, only a few people had ever interested him as much as Dorian Gray, yet the young man's mad adoration for someone else did not cause him the slightest pang of jealousy or distress.</t1478> <t1479>He was pleased with this.</t1479> <t1480>It made him a more interesting subject for study.</t1480> <t1481>He had always been fascinated by the methods of natural science, but the usual subjects of that science seemed to him trivial and unimportant.</t1481> <t1482>So he had begun with the vivisection of himself, as he had ended with the vivisection of others.</t1482> <t1483>Life — it appeared to him as something to be studied minutely.</t1483> <t1484>Nothing else seemed to be of any value in comparison.</t1484> <t1485>Indeed, when one looks at life in its strange crucible of pain and pleasure, one cannot wear a mask to shield the face, nor keep the fumes of sulfur from tormenting the brain, and clouding the imagination with monstrous fancies and distorted dreams.</t1485> <t1486>There are subtle poisons so exquisite that to know their properties one has to fall ill from them.</t1486> <t1487>There are strange maladies so bizarre that one has to go through them to understand their nature.</t1487> <t1488>Yet, how great the reward will be!</t1488> <t1489>How wonderful the world will become to us! To remember the strange, relentless logic of passion, and the multicolored life of the intellect — to observe where they meet, where they part, at what points they harmonize, at what points they are at odds — there is a pleasure in that!</t1489> <t1490>What does the cost matter?</t1490> <t1491>Perhaps we have never paid too high a price for any sensation.</t1491>
<t1492>He realized — and the thought brought a gleam of delight into his agate-brown eyes</t1492> <t1493>— that thanks to some words of his, melodious words spoken with a melodious accent, Dorian Gray's soul had turned towards this pure white girl and bowed reverently before her.</t1493> <t1494>To a very large extent, the young man was his own creation.</t1494> <t1495>He had fashioned him a bit prematurely.</t1495> <t1496>There was some rightness in that.</t1496> <t1497>Ordinary people would wait until life revealed its secrets to them, but for a few, for those chosen, the mysteries of life would unveil themselves before the veil was lifted.</t1497> <t1498>Sometimes it is the influence of art, and primarily of literary art, which has a direct connection with passion and intellect.</t1498> <t1499>But occasionally, a complex personality takes the place and assumes the role of art; for indeed, in its own way, being a true work of art, Life has its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry, or sculpture, or painting does.</t1499>
<t1500>Yes, the young man is a bit inexperienced.</t1500> <t1501>He harvested the winter crop while it was still spring.</t1501> <t1502>The pulse of youthful passion still beats within him, but he has begun to develop self-awareness.</t1502> <t1503>It is truly interesting to observe him.</t1503> <t1504>With a beautiful face and a beautiful soul, he is a creature of wonder.</t1504> <t1505>It doesn't matter how things end, or what fate has decreed for the end.</t1505> <t1506>He is like one of those compassionate characters in a magnificent procession or a play, whose joys seem very distant from us, yet whose sorrows evoke our capacity to appreciate beauty, and whose wounds are like roses.</t1506>
<t1507>The soul and the body, the body and the soul — how mysterious they are!</t1507> <t1508>There is animal instinct in the soul, and the body has its moments of spirituality.</t1508> <t1509>Sensations can be refined, while intellect can degenerate.</t1509> <t1510>Who can say where the urge of lust ends, or the natural impulse begins? How shallow are the arbitrary definitions of mediocre psychologists!</t1510> <t1511>Yet, it is very difficult to choose between the assertions of different schools of thought! Is the soul the shadow sitting in the house of sin?</t1511> <t1512>Or is the body truly within the soul, as Giordano Bruno once thought?</t1512> <t1513>The separation of spirit from matter is a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter is just as much a mystery.</t1513>
<t1514>Y began to wonder if it was possible to turn psychology into a pure science so that every small crack in life would be exposed before us.</t1514> <t1515>However, we always misunderstand ourselves and rarely understand others.</t1515> <t1516>Experience has no moral value at all.</t1516> <t1517>It is merely the name people give to their mistakes.</t1517> <t1518>Ethicists, as usual, see it as a warning method, demand a certain moral efficacy in character formation for it, and praise it as something that teaches us what to pursue and shows us what to avoid.</t1518> <t1519>But there is no motivation in experience.</t1519> <t1520>It has as little positive purpose as conscience itself.</t1520> <t1521>All it truly proves is that our future will be no different from our past, and the sin we once committed with disgust, we will continue to commit many times more, but with joy.</t1521>
<t1522>He saw clearly that the experimental method was the only method by which one could achieve any scientific analysis of passion; and certainly, Dorian Gray was a subject perfectly suited for him, and seemed to promise rich and useful results.</t1522> <t1523>His sudden mad love for Sybil Vane was a psychological phenomenon of little importance.</t1523> <t1524>It was certain that curiosity had a great deal to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences; however, it was not a simple passion but rather a very complex one.</t1524> <t1525>What was actually in it was the sensual instinct of youth transformed by the activities of the imagination, turning into something that seemed to the young man himself to be very far removed from sensation, and for that very reason, it was even more dangerous.</t1525> <t1526>It is the passions that we deceive ourselves about their origins that torment us the most.</t1526> <t1527>Our weakest motives are those whose nature we are unaware of.</t1527> <t1528>Often when we think we are testing others, we are actually testing ourselves.</t1528>
<t1529>While Lord Henry sat dreaming about these things, a knock touched the door, and his servant entered, reminding him that it was time to change clothes for dinner.</t1529><t1530>He stood up and looked out onto the street.</t1530><t1531>The sunset cast a deep golden-red hue on the upper windows of the houses opposite.</t1531><t1532>The panes glowed like sheets of metal heated by fire.</t1532><t1533>The sky above was like a withered rose.</t1533><t1534>He thought about the fiery, youthful life of his friend and wondered how it would all end.</t1534>
<t1535>When he got home, around half past twelve, he found a telegram lying on the table in the hall.</t1535> <t1536>He opened it and saw that it was from Dorian Gray. It informed him that he was engaged to Sibyl Vane.</t1536>
<t1537>Chapter 5</t1537>
<t1538>"Mom, mom, I'm so happy!" the girl whispered, burying her face into the lap of the tired, withered woman, her back turned to the glaring light that intruded, sitting on an armchair in their filthy living room.</t1538> <t1539>"I'm so happy!" she repeated, "and you must be happy too!"</t1539>
<t1540>Mrs. Vane shrank back, placing her thin, discolored batiste hands on her daughter's head.</t1540> <t1541>“Happiness!” she repeated, “I am only happy, Sibyl, when I see you perform.”</t1541>
<t1542>1 Bismuth Oxychloride: A substance found in nature, used for makeup since ancient times.</t1542>
<t1543>You should not think about anything other than your acting.</t1543> <t1544>Mr. Isaacs is very good to us, and we owe him money.</t1544><t1545>”</t1545>
<t1546>The girl looked up and pouted.</t1546> <t1547>“Money, money?” she exclaimed, “what's so important about money?</t1547> <t1548>Love is more important than money.</t1548><t1549>”</t1549>
<t1550>"Mr. Isaacs advanced me fifty pounds to pay off debts and to purchase suitable equipment for James.</t1550> <t1551>You should not forget that, Sibyl.</t1551> <t1552>Fifty pounds is a very large sum of money.</t1552> <t1553>Mr. Isaacs has been extremely considerate."</t1553>
<t1554>“He is not a gentleman, mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,” the girl said, standing up and moving closer to the window.</t1554>
<t1555>“I don't know how I would manage without him,” the older woman replied, irritably.</t1555>
<t1556>Sibyl Vane tossed her head back and laughed.</t1556> <t1557>“I don't need him anymore, mother.</t1557> <t1558>The Charming Prince will rule my life from now on.” Then she paused.</t1558> <t1559>A rose bloomed in her blood, casting a shadow on her cheek.</t1559> <t1560>Her breath quickened, parting the petals of her lips.</t1560> <t1561>They trembled.</t1561> <t1562>A certain passionate Southern wind swept over her, rustling her pretty dress.</t1562> <t1563>“I love him,” she said, simply.</t1563>
<t1564>“The foolish girl! The foolish girl!” were the parroted scolding words.</t1564> <t1565>The waving of crooked fingers, adorned with fake jewels, added absurdity to the words.</t1565>
<t1566>The girl laughed again.</t1566> <t1567>The joy of a caged bird resonated in her voice.</t1567> <t1568>Her eyes caught the melody, reflecting it as a radiant glow; then closed for a moment, as if to hide their secret.</t1568> <t1569>When they opened, a dreamy mist drifted across them.</t1569>
<t1570>The wisdom of thin-lipped advice spoke to her from the worn chair, cautiously alluding, quoting from a book on cowardice whose author parodied the name of common sense.</t1570> <t1571>She did not listen.</t1571> <t1572>She was free in the prison of her passion.</t1572> <t1573>Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her.</t1573> <t1574>She had asked Memory to recreate him.</t1574> <t1575>She had sent her soul to find him, and it had brought him back.</t1575> <t1576>His kiss burned on her lips once more.</t1576> <t1577>Her eyelids were warm with his breath again.</t1577>
<t1578>Then Wisdom changed its method and instructed about tracking and detection.</t1578> <t1579>This young man must be wealthy.</t1579> <t1580>If so, marriage is something to consider.</t1580> <t1581>On the rim of her ear, waves of worldly cunning shattered.</t1581> <t1582>Arrows of trickery grazed past her.</t1582> <t1583>She watched the thin lips move and smiled.</t1583>
<t1584>Suddenly she felt the need to speak.</t1584> <t1585>The loud silence bothered her.</t1585> <t1586>“Mother, mother,” she cried out, “why does he love me so much? I know why I love him.</t1586> <t1587>I love him because he is like what Love itself should become.</t1587> <t1588>But what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him.</t1588> <t1589>But — why, I cannot say — even though I feel so much inferior to him, I do not feel inferior.</t1589> <t1590>I feel proud, extremely proud.</t1590> <t1591>Mother, did you love my father as I love Prince Charming?”</t1591>
<t1592>The older woman turned pale under the coarse powder on her cheeks, and her dry lips twitched in pain.</t1592> <t1593>Sybyl rushed to her, wrapped her arms around her neck, and kissed her. "Forgive me, mother.</t1593> <t1594>I know talking about father causes you pain.</t1594> <t1595>But it only hurts because you loved him so much.</t1595> <t1596>Don't look so sad.</t1596> <t1597>Today, I am as happy as you were twenty years ago.</t1597> <t1598>Oh! Let me be happy forever</t1598><t1599>!”</t1599>
<t1600>"My child, you are still too young to be thinking about being infatuated with love.</t1600> <t1601>Moreover, what do you know about this young man?</t1601> <t1602>You don't even know his name yet.</t1602> <t1603>This whole thing is extremely troublesome, and actually, with James about to leave for Australia, and me having too many things to think about, I must say that you should have shown more consideration.</t1603> <t1604>However, as I said earlier, if he were rich..."</t1604>
<t1605>"Oh! Mother, mother, please let me be happy!"</t1605>
<t1606>Mrs. Vane glanced at her, and, with one of those theatrical, artificial gestures that often become a second nature to actors, hugged her tightly in her arms.</t1606> <t1607>At this moment, the door opened, and a young man with shaggy brown hair stepped into the room.</t1607> <t1608>He had a sturdy build, large limbs, and was somewhat clumsy.</t1608> <t1609>He was not as well-bred as his sister.</t1609> <t1610>It was hard to guess the close relationship that existed between them.</t1610> <t1611>Mrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him, smiling more deeply.</t1611> <t1612>She silently elevated her son to the level of an audience.</t1612> <t1613>She felt certain that the scene was very interesting.</t1613>
<t1614>"Can you save a few kisses for me, Sybil? I would really appreciate it," the young man said, with a gentle murmur.</t1614>
<t1615>"Oh! But I don't like being kissed, Jim," she exclaimed. "I am a grumpy old bear." And she ran across the room to hug him tightly.</t1615>
<t1616>James Vane lovingly looked at his sister's face.</t1616> <t1617>"I want you to go for a walk with me, Sibyl.</t1617> <t1618>I don't believe I will ever see this dreadful city of London again.</t1618> <t1619>I am certain that I don't want to."</t1619>
<t1620>"My son, don't say such frightening things," Mrs. Vane murmured, picking up the gaudy costume with a sigh, and began to mend it.</t1620> <t1621>She felt a bit disappointed that he didn't join the group.</t1621>
<t1622>That will increase the theatrical vividness of the situation.</t1622>
<t1623>“Why not, mom? I'm telling the truth.”</t1623>
<t1624>"You cause me pain, my son.</t1624> <t1625>I believe you will return from Australia with a wealthy status.</t1625> <t1626>I believe there is no upper class of any kind in the colonies, nothing that I can call the upper class; so when you have succeeded, you must come back and establish yourself in London."</t1626>
<t1627>"The upper class!" the young man muttered.</t1627> <t1628>"I don't want to know anything about that.</t1628> <t1629>I just want to make some money to get mother and Sibyl off the stage.</t1629> <t1630>I hate it."</t1630>
<t1631>"Oh, Jim!" Sibyl said with a laugh, "Why are you so mean! But will you really take a walk with me? That's great! I was afraid you were going to say goodbye to some of your friends — say goodbye to Tom Hardy, the guy who gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, the guy who teased you for smoking it.</t1631> <t1632>You are so sweet for letting me enjoy your last afternoon. Where shall we go?</t1632> <t1633>Let's go to the Park."</t1633>
<t1634>"You look so messy," he replied, frowning.</t1634> <t1635>"Only those who are well-dressed go to the Park."</t1635>
<t1636>"Too much nonsense, Jim," she whispered, stroking his sleeve.</t1636>
<t1637>He hesitated for a moment.</t1637> <t1638>"Alright," he finally said, "but don't take too long to change."</t1638> <t1639>She skipped out of the door.</t1639> <t1640>You could hear her singing as she ran upstairs.</t1640> <t1641>Her little feet pitter-pattered overhead.</t1641>
<t1642>You paced back and forth in the room a few times.</t1642> <t1643>Then you turned to the silent figure on the chair. "Mom, is my stuff ready?" you asked.</t1643>
<t1644>“Everything is ready, James,” she replied, her eyes not leaving her work.</t1644> <t1645>For the past few months, she had felt uncomfortable whenever she was alone with her rude, cold son.</t1645> <t1646>Her shallow reserved nature found it difficult when their eyes met.</t1646> <t1647>She often wondered if he suspected anything.</t1647> <t1648>The silence, due to his lack of further comments, became unbearable for her.</t1648> <t1649>She began to complain.</t1649> <t1650>Women protect themselves by attacking, just as they attack with sudden and strange surrenders. “I hope you are satisfied, James, with your life at sea,” she said.</t1650> <t1651>“You should remember that it was your own choice.</t1651> <t1652>You could have joined a law office.</t1652> <t1653>Lawyers are a very respectable class, and in the province, they often dine with the wealthiest families.”</t1653>
<t1654>“I hate the offices and I hate the clerks,” he replied.</t1654> <t1655>“But you are absolutely right.</t1655> <t1656>I have chosen my own life.</t1656> <t1657>All I need to say is, protect Sibyl. Don't let her be harmed.</t1657> <t1658>Mother, you must protect her.”</t1658>
<t1659>“James, what you’re saying is really strange.</t1659> <t1660>Of course, I have to protect Sibyl.”</t1660>
<t1661>"I heard that a noble person comes to the theater every night and goes backstage to talk to her.</t1661> <t1662>Is that true? What does that mean?"</t1662>
<t1663>“You are talking about things you don't understand, James.</t1663> <t1664>In this profession, we have become accustomed to receiving a lot of very pleasing attention.</t1664> <t1665>I myself have received many bouquets at the same time.</t1665> <t1666>That is when the performance is truly understood.</t1666> <t1667>As for Sibyl, I don't know if her affection is serious at the moment.</t1667> <t1668>But one thing is certain, the young man being talked about is a perfect gentleman.</t1668> <t1669>He is always very polite to me.</t1669> <t1670>Moreover, he has a wealthy lifestyle, and the flowers he sends are also very lovely.”</t1670>
<t1671>“Mother doesn't even know its name yet, anyway,” the young man said, gruffly.</t1671>
<t1672>“Not yet,” his mother replied, with a calm expression on her face. “He hasn't revealed his real name yet.</t1672> <t1673>I think it's quite romantic of him.</t1673> <t1674>He must be a member of the nobility.”</t1674>
<t1675>James Vane bit his lip. "Protect Sibyl, mother," he cried, "protect her."</t1675>
<t1676>“My son, you make me very sad.</t1676> <t1677>Sibyl has always received special care from me.</t1677> <t1678>Of course, if that gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why your sister shouldn't associate with him.</t1678> <t1679>I believe he belongs to the aristocratic class.</t1679> <t1680>He exhibits all the outward signs of it, I must say.</t1680> <t1681>There will surely be a splendid wedding for Sibyl.</t1681> <t1682>They will make a stunning couple.</t1682> <t1683>His beauty is truly extraordinary; everyone notices him.”</t1683>
<t1684>The young man muttered something to himself and tapped his rough fingers on the windowpane.</t1684> <t1685>He had just turned around to say something when the door opened, and Sibyl ran in.</t1685>
<t1686>“Why are both of you so serious!” she exclaimed.</t1686> <t1687>“Is something wrong?”</t1687>
<t1688>“Nothing,” he replied.</t1688> <t1689>“I suppose we should live seriously from time to time.</t1689> <t1690>Goodbye mother; I will have dinner at five o'clock.</t1690> <t1691>Everything is packed, except for my shirt, so you don't need to worry.”</t1691>
<t1692>“Goodbye, my son,” she replied, with an awkwardly formal bow.</t1692>
<t1693>She was extremely uncomfortable with the tone of voice he had started using with her, and there was something in his eyes that made her feel scared.</t1693>
<t1694>“Kiss me, mother,” the girl said.</t1694> <t1695>Her flower-like lips touched the withered cheek, warming its frost.</t1695>
<t1696>“My child! My child!” Mrs. Vane cried out, looking up at the ceiling to find an imaginary gallery seat.</t1696>
<t1697>"Let's go, Sibyl," her brother said, impatiently.</t1697> <t1698>He hated his mother's pretentious mannerisms.</t1698>
<t1699>They went outside and into the shimmering, breezy sunlight, strolling down the gloomy Euston Road.</t1699> <t1700>Passersby glanced with surprise at the gloomy, coarse, poorly dressed, and disheveled young man walking with a graceful young lady who looked very elegant. He looked like an ordinary gardener walking with a rose.</t1700>
<t1701>Jim occasionally grimaced when he caught the curious gaze of some stranger.</t1701><t1702>He had that trait of disliking being stared at, which often emerges in geniuses in their later years, and never abandons ordinary people.</t1702><t1703>Sibyl, however, was completely unaware of the impression she made.</t1703><t1704>Her love was trembling in the smile on her lips.</t1704><t1705>She was thinking about Prince Charming, and, so that she could think about him even more, she didn't talk about him but continued to chatter about the ship Jim would sail on to the open sea, the gold he was sure to find, the wonderful heiress he would save from the hands of the evil brigands, dressed in red shirts.</t1705><t1706>For he was no longer a sailor, or a seller and transporter of goods, or whatever he was about to become.</t1706><t1707>Oh, no! The life of a sailor was truly dreadful.</t1707><t1708>Just imagine being confined in a dreadful ship, with the hunchbacked waves, roaring hoarsely, trying to break in, and a black wind toppling the masts, tearing the sails into long, howling shreds!</t1708><t1709>He had left the ship in Melbourne, politely bid farewell to the captain, and immediately dashed off to the goldfields.</t1709><t1710>Less than a week had passed before he found an enormous gold nugget, the largest nugget ever discovered, and brought it down to the coast in a wagon guarded by six mounted policemen.</t1710><t1711>The brigands attacked them three times and were defeated in an extremely brutal massacre.</t1711><t1712>Oh, no.</t1712><t1713>He would not go to the goldfields at all.</t1713><t1714>They were dreadful places, where people got drunk, shot each other in saloons, and used foul language.</t1714><t1715>He would become a kind shepherd, and one afternoon, while riding home, he would see a beautiful heiress being kidnapped by a bandit on a black horse, and he would chase after and rescue her.</t1715><t1716>Of course, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and then they would marry, return to their homeland, and live in a vast mansion in London.</t1716><t1717>Yes, there were interesting things awaiting him there.</t1717><t1718>But he had to be very good, not lose his temper or spend foolishly.</t1718><t1719>She was only one year older than him, but she understood life much better.</t1719><t1720>He also had to make sure to write to her with every mail, and say his prayers every night before he went to sleep.</t1720><t1721>God was very merciful and would protect him.</t1721><t1722>She would also pray for him, and after a few years, he would return, rich and happy.</t1722>
<t1723>The young man listened to her gloomily, not responding.</t1723> <t1724>He was feeling down because he had to be away from home.</t1724>
<t1725>However, it was not just this matter that made him troubled.</t1725> <t1726>Despite his lack of experience, he still had a very uneasy feeling about the danger in Sibyl's situation. This dandy, who was courting her, might have bad intentions towards her.</t1726> <t1727>He was a nobleman, and he hated him for that, hated him due to some strange class instinct that he could not explain, and for that reason, it dominated him even more.</t1727> <t1728>He was also aware of the shallowness and frivolity in his mother's nature, and in that he saw endless danger for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.</t1728> <t1729>Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older, they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.</t1729>
<t1730>Mom! In your heart, you have something you want to ask your mom, something you have been holding onto for many months in silence.</t1730> <t1731>A casual remark you overheard in the theater, a mocking whisper that reached your ears one night while you were waiting at the stage door, unleashed a terrible stream of thoughts.</t1731> <t1732>You remember it as if it were a whip lash across your face.</t1732> <t1733>Your eyebrows furrowed together into a wedge-shaped wrinkle, and with a painful grimace, you bit your lower lip.</t1733>
<t1734>"You don't listen to anything I say, Jim," Sibyl cried, "and I'm making the most exciting plans for your future."</t1734> <t1735>"Say something."</t1735>
<t1736>“What do you want me to say?”</t1736>
<t1737>“Oh! That you will be a good boy, and not forget the whole family,” she replied, smiling at him.</t1737>
<t1738>He shrugged.</t1738> <t1739>“It's more likely that you forgot me than I forgot you, Sibyl.”</t1739>
<t1740>She blushed.</t1740> <t1741>"What do you mean, Jim?" she asked.</t1741>
<t1742>"You have a new friend, I heard that."</t1742> <t1743>"Who is he? Why didn't you tell me about him?"</t1743> <t1744>"He doesn't have good intentions towards you."</t1744>
<t1745>“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “I shouldn't say anything against him.</t1745> <t1746>I love him.”</t1746>
<t1747>“Why, you don't even know his name yet,” the young man replied.</t1747> <t1748>“Who is he? I have the right to know.”</t1748>
<t1749>"His name is Prince Charming.</t1749> <t1750>Do you like that name?</t1750> <t1751>Oh! You are such a silly boy!</t1751> <t1752>You must never forget it.</t1752> <t1753>Just by seeing him, you will think he is the most wonderful person in the world.</t1753> <t1754>One day you will meet him: when you return from Australia.</t1754> <t1755>You will like him very much.</t1755> <t1756>Everyone likes him, and I... love him.</t1756> <t1757>I wish you could come to the theater tonight.</t1757> <t1758>He will be there, and I will play Juliet.</t1758> <t1759>Oh! How can I play that role!</t1759> <t1760>Imagine, Jim, being in love and playing Juliet!</t1760> <t1761>With him sitting there!</t1761> <t1762>Acting to please him! I fear I might frighten the audience, either scare them or enchant them.</t1762> <t1763>To love is to surpass oneself.</t1763> <t1764>Poor Mr. Isaacs will shout 'genius' to the idlers at the pub.</t1764> <t1765>He has praised me like a creed; tonight he will declare me a revelation.</t1765> <t1766>I feel it.</t1766> <t1767>And it is all for him, only for him, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of beauty.</t1767> <t1768>But I am too poor for him.</t1768> <t1769>Poor?</t1769> <t1770>So what?</t1770> <t1771>When poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window.</t1771> <t1772>Our book of proverbs needs to be rewritten.</t1772> <t1773>They were made in winter, but now it is summer; no, I think for me it is spring, a true dance of flowers in the blue sky."</t1773>
<t1774>"He is a nobleman," the young man said, dejectedly.</t1774>
<t1775>“A prince!” she exclaimed, melodiously.</t1775>
<t1776>"What else do you want?"</t1776>
<t1777>“He wants to turn you into a slave.</t1777><t1778>”</t1778>
<t1779>“She shuddered at the thought of being free.”</t1779>
<t1780>“I want you to be careful with him.”</t1780>
<t1781>“Seeing you is to worship you, knowing you is to trust you.”</t1781>
<t1782>"Sibyl, you are crazy about him."</t1782>
<t1783>She smiled and took his arm.</t1783> <t1784>“Dear old Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred years old.</t1784> <t1785>One day you will fall in love yourself.</t1785> <t1786>Then you will know what it's like.</t1786> <t1787>Don't act so sulky.</t1787> <t1788>You should certainly be happy thinking that even though I'm about to go far away, I'm leaving behind a sister who is happier than ever.</t1788> <t1789>Life has been harsh to both of us, so harsh and difficult.</t1789> <t1790>But now it will be different.</t1790> <t1791>I'm going to a new world, and I've found a world.</t1791> <t1792>There are two chairs here; let's sit down and watch the well-dressed people go by.”</t1792>
<t1793>They sat amidst the crowd of people watching the scenery.</t1793> <t1794>The tulip flower beds across the street bloomed like lively rings of fire.</t1794> <t1795>White dust, like a cloud of iris root powder, swayed and hovered in the yearning air.</t1795> <t1796>The brightly colored umbrellas floated like giant butterflies.</t1796>
<t1797>She made her brother talk about himself, about his hopes, about his expectations.</t1797> <t1798>He spoke slowly and with considerable effort.</t1798> <t1799>They exchanged words like gamblers exchanging chips in a card game.</t1799> <t1800>Sibyl felt heavy-hearted.</t1800> <t1801>She couldn't share her joy.</t1801> <t1802>A weary smile that curved her gloomy mouth was the only sign she could give.</t1802> <t1803>After a while, she began to fall silent.</t1803> <t1804>Suddenly, she caught a glimpse of golden hair and smiling lips, and in an open carriage, along with two ladies, Dorian Gray passed by.</t1804>
<t1805>She stood up abruptly.</t1805> <t1806>"It's him!" she exclaimed.</t1806>
<t1807>“What?” Jim Vane said.</t1807>
<t1808>“Prince Charming,” she replied, watching the four-wheeled convertible carriage.</t1808>
<t1809>He jumped up, grabbing her arm forcefully.</t1809> <t1810>"Show him to me.</t1810> <t1811>Who is he?</t1811> <t1812>Point him out.</t1812> <t1813>I must see him!" he shouted; but at that moment, the Duke of Berwick's four-horse carriage drove in between them, and by the time it left an opening, the open carriage had already glided out of the Park.</t1813>
<t1814>“He is gone,” Sibyl whispered sadly. “I wish you had seen him.”</t1814>
<t1815>“I also wish I had seen it, because I swear to God in heaven, if he ever harms you, I will kill him.”</t1815>
<t1816>She looked at him fearfully.</t1816> <t1817>He repeated his words.</t1817> <t1818>They cut through the air sweetly like a knife.</t1818> <t1819>Everyone around began to gape and stare.</t1819> <t1820>A woman stood close to her and giggled.</t1820>
<t1821>“Let's go, Jim; let's go,” she whispered.</t1821> <t1822>He stubbornly followed her as she moved through the crowd.</t1822> <t1823>He felt happy about what he had just said.</t1823>
<t1824>When they reached the statue of Achilles, she turned around.</t1824> <t1825>The pity in her eyes turned into laughter on her lips.</t1825> <t1826>She shook her head at him. "You are so silly, Jim, too silly; a naughty boy, that's all.</t1826> <t1827>How can you say such terrible things?</t1827> <t1828>You don't know what you're talking about.</t1828> <t1829>You are just jealous and bitter.</t1829> <t1830>Oh! I hope you will love.</t1830> <t1831>Love makes people kinder, and what you said is really cruel."</t1831>
<t1832>“I am sixteen years old,” he replied, “and I know what I'm saying.</t1832> <t1833>Mom can't help you.</t1833> <t1834>Mom doesn't know how to take care of you.</t1834> <t1835>Now I wish I hadn't gone to Australia at all.</t1835> <t1836>I want to quit everything.</t1836> <t1837>I would probably do that if I hadn't signed the contract terms.</t1837><t1838>”</t1838>
<t1839>“Oh, don't be so serious, Jim. You're like one of the characters in those naive melodramas that mother used to love performing.</t1839> <t1840>I won't argue with you. I've seen him, and oh my!</t1840> <t1841>Seeing him is a complete happiness.</t1841> <t1842>We won't argue anymore.</t1842> <t1843>I know you would never harm anyone I love, right?”</t1843>
<t1844>“As long as you still love him, I don't think so,” was the gloomy reply.</t1844>
<t1845>“I will love him forever!” she exclaimed.</t1845> <t1846>“And him?”</t1846>
<t1847>“The same, forever”</t1847>
<t1848>“He should be like that.”</t1848>
<t1849>She stepped back from him.</t1849> <t1850>Then she smiled and placed her hand on his arm.</t1850> <t1851>He was just a child.</t1851>
<t1852>At the Marble Arch, they hailed a bus, which dropped them off right next to their shabby house on Euston Road.</t1852> <t1853>It was past five o'clock, and Sibyl had to rest for a few hours before performing.</t1853> <t1854>Jim insisted that she do so.</t1854> <t1855>He said that he preferred to say goodbye to her when their mother was absent.</t1855> <t1856>Their mother would surely create a scene, and he hated all kinds of scenes.</t1856>
<t1857>They bid farewell to each other in Sibyl's private room.</t1857> <t1858>There was jealousy in the boy's heart, and a seething, murderous hatred towards the stranger, whom he perceived had come between them.</t1858> <t1859>Yet, when her arm wrapped around his neck and her fingers wandered through his hair, he softened, and kissed her with genuine affection.</t1859> <t1860>Tears blurred his vision as he descended the stairs.</t1860>
<t1861>Your mother is waiting for you downstairs.</t1861> <t1862>She grumbles about your lack of punctuality as you walk in.</t1862> <t1863>You don't respond, but sit down to eat your meager meal.</t1863> <t1864>Flies buzz around the table and crawl on the stained tablecloth.</t1864> <t1865>Through the rumble of buses and the clatter of hired carriages, you can hear a monotonous voice devouring the remaining minutes with you.</t1865>
<t1866>A moment later, he pushed the plate aside and rested his head in his hands.</t1866> <t1867>He felt that he had the right to know.</t1867> <t1868>That matter should have been told to him earlier, if it was as he suspected.</t1868> <t1869>Stunned with fear, his mother watched him.</t1869> <t1870>Her words fell from her lips mechanically.</t1870> <t1871>The tattered lace handkerchief crumpled in her fingers.</t1871> <t1872>When the clock struck six, he stood up and walked to the door.</t1872> <t1873>Then he turned back and looked at her.</t1873> <t1874>Their eyes met.</t1874> <t1875>In her eyes, he saw a wild plea for forgiveness.</t1875> <t1876>It made him furious.</t1876>
<t1877>“Mom, I have something to ask you,” he said.</t1877> <t1878>Her eyes wandered around the room absentmindedly.</t1878> <t1879>She did not respond.</t1879> <t1880>“Tell me the truth.</t1880> <t1881>I have the right to know.</t1881> <t1882>Did you marry my father?”</t1882>
<t1883>She let out a deep sigh.</t1883> <t1884>It was a sign of relief.</t1884> <t1885>The dreadful moment, the moment that she had feared day and night, week after week, month after month, had finally come, yet she did not feel afraid.</t1885> <t1886>Indeed, to some extent, it was a disappointment to her.</t1886> <t1887>The bluntness of the question demanded a direct answer.</t1887> <t1888>The situation was not gradually led step by step.</t1888> <t1889>It was really crude.</t1889> <t1890>It reminded her of a bad rehearsal.</t1890>
<t1891>"No," she replied, astonished by the cruel simplicity of life.</t1891>
<t1892>“So my father is a bastard?” the young man shouted, clenching his fists tightly.</t1892>
<t1893>She shook her head. "I know he was preoccupied.</t1893> <t1894>Your father and I loved each other very much.</t1894> <t1895>If he were still alive, he would probably have provided for us.</t1895> <t1896>Do not criticize him, my son.</t1896> <t1897>He is your father, and a noble man.</t1897> <t1898>Indeed, he comes from a noble lineage."</t1898>
<t1899>A curse escaped his lips. "I don't care about myself," he shouted, "but don't let Sibyl... It's that nobleman, isn't it, who is in love with her, or says he is?"</t1899> <t1900>"Also, I suppose, he belongs to the nobility."</t1900>
<t1901>In an instant, an overwhelming sense of humiliation engulfed the woman.</t1901> <t1902>Her head drooped down.</t1902> <t1903>She wiped her eyes with trembling hands.</t1903> <t1904>“Sibyl has a mother,” she whispered; “a mother does not.”</t1904>
<t1905>The young man was moved.</t1905> <t1906>He approached his mother, bent down, and kissed her. "I'm sorry if I caused you pain by asking about father," he said, "but I couldn't help it.</t1906> <t1907>I have to go now.</t1907> <t1908>Goodbye.</t1908> <t1909>Don't forget that from now on, you will only have one child to look after, and believe me, if that man harms my sister, I will find out who he is, track him down, and kill him like a dog.</t1909> <t1910>I swear."</t1910>
<t1911>The exaggerated madness of threats, the lively gestures accompanying them, the frantic and impassioned words made life seem more colorful to her.</t1911> <t1912>She had become accustomed to this atmosphere.</t1912> <t1913>She could breathe more comfortably, and for the first time in many months, she felt a genuine admiration for her son.</t1913> <t1914>Perhaps she even wanted to continue this scene with the same emotional intensity, but he cut it short.</t1914> <t1915>Suitcases had to be brought down, scarves had to be found.</t1915> <t1916>The boarding house staff hurried in and out.</t1916> <t1917>Bargaining with the coachman.</t1917> <t1918>That moment was lost in the usual details.</t1918> <t1919>With a renewed sense of disappointment, she waved a tattered lace handkerchief from the window as her son was taken away.</t1919> <t1920>She knew well that a great opportunity had been squandered.</t1920> <t1921>She consoled herself by telling Sibyl how lonely her life felt, as now she had only one child left to care for.</t1921> <t1922>She remembered that phrase.</t1922> <t1923>It pleased her.</t1923> <t1924>As for the threat, she said nothing.</t1924> <t1925>It had been expressed vividly and tragically.</t1925> <t1926>She felt that the whole family would laugh about it someday.</t1926>
<t1927>Chapter 6</t1927>
<t1928>"I suppose you have already heard the news, Basil?" Lord Henry asked that afternoon, when Hallward appeared in a small private room at Bristol, where dinner was set for three people.</t1928>
<t1929>“Not yet, Harry,” the artist replied, handing his hat and coat to the bowing servant.</t1929> <t1930>“What news? It’s not about politics, I hope?</t1930> <t1931>I don’t care about it.</t1931> <t1932>There’s hardly a single figure in the House of Commons worth painting; although many of them should be whitewashed.</t1932><t1933>”</t1933>
<t1934>"Dorian Gray has promised to get married," Lord Henry said and watched the artist as he spoke.</t1934>
<t1935>Hallward started, then frowned.</t1935> <t1936>"Dorian has promised to marry!" he exclaimed. "Impossible!"</t1936>
<t1937>"The truth is plain to see."</t1937>
<t1938>“Marry whom?”</t1938>
<t1939>“Take some unknown little actress.”</t1939>
<t1940>"I can't believe that.</t1940> <t1941>Dorian is too clever for that."</t1941>
<t1942>“Dorian is too experienced to not occasionally do something foolish, my dear Basil.”</t1942>
<t1943>“Marriage isn't something that people can just do from time to time, Harry.”</t1943>
<t1944>“Except for America,” Lord Henry replied, languidly.</t1944> <t1945>“But I did not say he was married.</t1945> <t1946>I said he was engaged to be married.</t1946> <t1947>There is a great difference.</t1947> <t1948>I have a very clear memory of being married, but I remember nothing at all about being engaged.</t1948> <t1949>I am inclined to think that I never was engaged.</t1949><t1950>”</t1950>
<t1951>“But think about Dorian's lineage, both his status and wealth.</t1951> <t1952>Marrying someone so much inferior is very foolish for him.”</t1952>
<t1953>"If you want him to marry this girl, then tell him that, Basil.</t1953> <t1954>He will certainly do it.</t1954> <t1955>Whenever people do something extremely foolish, it is always for the noblest reasons."</t1955>
<t1956>"I hope that girl is well-behaved, Harry.</t1956> <t1957>I don't want to see Dorian tied to some hideous creature, someone who could corrupt his nature and destroy his intellect."</t1957>
<t1958>“Ah, she is more than just well-behaved — she is beautiful,” Lord Henry whispered, sipping a glass of vermouth with bitters.</t1958> <t1959>“Dorian says she is beautiful; and he rarely makes mistakes about these sorts of things.</t1959> <t1960>His portrait of him has accelerated his ability to judge the personal appearance of others.</t1960> <t1961>It has had that wonderful effect, among other things.</t1961> <t1962>We will see her tonight, if he doesn't forget the appointment.</t1962><t1963>”</t1963>
<t1964>“Are you serious?”</t1964>
<t1965>“Completely serious, Basil.</t1965> <t1966>I would be destitute if I thought I would ever be more serious than I am now.”</t1966>
<t1967>“But do you agree with this, Harry?” the artist asked, pacing back and forth in the room, biting his lip.</t1967> <t1968>“You can't possibly agree with this.</t1968> <t1969>It's just some foolish infatuation.”</t1969>
<t1970>“I never approve or disapprove of anything now.</t1970> <t1971>That is an absurd attitude to take towards life.</t1971> <t1972>We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices.</t1972> <t1973>I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do.</t1973> <t1974>If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality chooses is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with an actress who plays Juliet, and proposes to her.</t1974> <t1975>Why not?</t1975> <t1976>If he married Messalina, he would be none the less interesting.</t1976> <t1977>You know I am not a champion of marriage.</t1977> <t1978>The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish.</t1978> <t1979>And unselfish people are colourless.</t1979> <t1980>They lack individuality.</t1980> <t1981>However, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex.</t1981> <t1982>They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos.</t1982> <t1983>They have to live more than one life, and they become more highly organized, and to be more highly organized I think is the object of man’s existence.</t1983> <t1984>Besides, every experience is of value, and, whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience.</t1984> <t1985>I hope that Dorian Gray will marry this girl, worship her for six months, and then suddenly be fascinated by someone else.</t1985> <t1986>He would be a wonderful study.”</t1986>
<t1987>“You cannot speak seriously about any of this, Harry; you know that you are like that.</t1987> <t1988>If Dorian Gray's life is ruined, no one will be more upset than you.</t1988> <t1989>You are much better than you keep pretending to be.”</t1989>
<t1990>Lord Henry laughed.</t1990> <t1991>“The reason why all of us like to think so well of others is because we are all afraid of ourselves.</t1991> <t1992>The basis of optimism is sheer terror.</t1992> <t1993>We think we are generous because we credit our neighbors with the possession of those virtues that are likely to benefit us.</t1993> <t1994>We praise the banker so that we can overdraw our accounts, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets.</t1994> <t1995>I am quite serious in all that I say.</t1995> <t1996>I disapprove of optimism more than anything.</t1996> <t1997>As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested.</t1997> <t1998>If you want to harm nature, you only need to reform it.</t1998> <t1999>As for marriage, it is of course ridiculous, but there are other ties far more interesting between men and women.</t1999> <t2000>I am all for encouraging them.</t2000> <t2001>They have the charm of novelty.</t2001> <t2002>But here is Dorian himself.</t2002> <t2003>He will tell you more than I can.”</t2003>
<t2004>“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you should congratulate me!” the young man said, tossing aside his afternoon cloak with satin-lined wings, and shaking hands with each friend in turn.</t2004> <t2005>“I have never been so happy.</t2005> <t2006>Of course, it is sudden; everything is truly exciting.</t2006> <t2007>However, I feel it seems like the thing I have been searching for all my life.”</t2007> <t2008>He blushed with excitement and joy, and looked extraordinarily handsome.</t2008>
<t2009>“I hope you will always be happy, Dorian,” Hallward said, “but I really cannot forgive you for not telling me about your engagement.</t2009> <t2010>Yet you told Harry.”</t2010>
<t2011>“And I do not forgive you for being late for dinner,” Lord Henry interrupted, placing a hand on the young man's shoulder, and smiling as he spoke.</t2011> <t2012>“Now, let us sit down and see how the new chef here is, then you will tell us what happened.”</t2012>
<t2013>“Actually, there isn't much to tell,” Dorian exclaimed, as they sat down around the small round table.</t2013><t2014>“What happened is simply this.</t2014><t2015>After I left you yesterday afternoon, Harry, I changed clothes, had a quick dinner at that tiny Italian restaurant on Rupert Street that you recommended to me, and at eight o'clock I went down to the theater.</t2015><t2016>Sibyl was playing Rosalind.</t2016><t2017>Of course, the scenery was dreadful, and Orlando was absurd.</t2017><t2018>But Sibyl! If only you had seen her!</t2018><t2019>When she came out in her boy's costume, she was absolutely perfect.</t2019><t2020>She wore a moss-green velvet doublet with cinnamon-colored sleeves, long cross-gartered brown stockings, a small green cap with an eagle feather fastened by a jewel, and a cloak with a hood lined with dull red fabric.</t2020><t2021>It seemed I had never seen her more exquisite.</t2021><t2022>She had all the delicate charm of the Tanagra statue you have in your studio, Basil.</t2022><t2023>Her hair clustered around her face like black leaves around a faded rose.</t2023><t2024>As for her acting — well, you will see her tonight.</t2024><t2025>She is simply a born artist.</t2025><t2026>I sat in the darkened box and was absolutely enthralled.</t2026><t2027>I forgot I was in London and in the nineteenth century.</t2027><t2028>I had wandered far away with my love to a forest that no one had ever seen.</t2028><t2029>After the performance ended, I went backstage and talked to her.</t2029><t2030>As we sat together, suddenly there appeared in her eyes a look that I had never seen there before.</t2030><t2031>My lips moved towards hers.</t2031><t2032>We kissed.</t2032><t2033>I cannot describe to you what I felt at that moment.</t2033><t2034>It seemed as if my whole life had been narrowed to a perfect point of rosy joy.</t2034><t2035>She trembled all over, and shook like a white narcissus.</t2035><t2036>Then she sank down and knelt, kissing my hands.</t2036><t2037>I feel I shouldn't be telling you all this, but I can't help it.</t2037><t2038>Of course, our engagement is an absolute secret.</t2038><t2039>She hasn't even told her mother.</t2039><t2040>I don't know what my guardians will say.</t2040><t2041>Lord Radley will certainly be furious.</t2041><t2042>I don't care.</t2042><t2043>I will come of age in less than a year, and then I can do whatever I like.</t2043><t2044>I was right, Basil, wasn't I, to take my love out of poetry, and find my wife in Shakespeare's plays? The lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secrets into my ear.</t2044><t2045>I have been embraced by Rosalind's arms, and kissed by Juliet on the mouth.”</t2045>
<t2046>"Yes, Dorian, I suppose you are right," Hallward said slowly.</t2046>
<t2047>"Did you see her today?" Lord Henry asked.</t2047>
<t2048>Dorian Gray shook his head. "I left her in the forest of Arden, I will find her in an orchard in Verona."</t2048>
<t2049>Lord Henry sipped champagne thoughtfully. "So at what specific moment did you mention the word marriage, Dorian?</t2049> <t2050>And what did she say in response?</t2050> <t2051>Perhaps you've forgotten everything."</t2051>
<t2052>“My dear Harry, I do not consider it as a commercial transaction, and I am not making any formal offer at all.</t2052> <t2053>I told her that I love her, and she said she is not worthy to be my wife.</t2053> <t2054>Not worthy! Why, to me, the whole world is nothing compared to her.</t2054><t2055>”</t2055>
<t2056>“Women are extremely practical,” Lord Henry muttered —</t2056> <t2057>"much more practical than we are.</t2057> <t2058>In those kinds of situations, we often forget to say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.”</t2058>
<t2059>Hallward put his hand on his arm. "Don't, Harry. You have already upset Dorian.</t2059> <t2060>He is not like other men.</t2060> <t2061>He will never bring sorrow to anyone.</t2061> <t2062>His nature is too noble for that."</t2062>
<t2063>Lord Henry looked across the table.</t2063> <t2064>“Dorian is never annoyed with me,” he replied.</t2064> <t2065>“I asked that question for the best possible reason, the only reason that, indeed, excuses one for asking any question at all — sheer curiosity.</t2065> <t2066>I have a theory that it is always women who propose to us, and not we who propose to women.</t2066> <t2067>Except, of course, in the lives of the lower middle class.</t2067> <t2068>But nowadays the lower middle class is behind the times.”</t2068>
<t2069>Dorian Gray smiled and tossed his head.</t2069> <t2070>“You are incorrigible, Harry; but I don't mind.</t2070> <t2071>It is impossible to be angry with you.</t2071> <t2072>When you meet Sibyl, you will feel that anyone who could harm her must be a beast, a heartless beast.</t2072> <t2073>I cannot understand why anyone would want to disgrace the person they love.</t2073> <t2074>I love Sibyl Vane.</t2074> <t2075>I want to place her on a golden pedestal and watch the world worship the girl who belongs to me.</t2075> <t2076>What is marriage? An irrevocable vow.</t2076> <t2077>You mock it for that reason, don't you?</t2077> <t2078>Oh! don't mock it.</t2078> <t2079>It is an irrevocable vow that I want to bear.</t2079> <t2080>Her expectations make me faithful, her trust makes me kind.</t2080> <t2081>When I am with her, I regret everything you have taught me.</t2081> <t2082>I become different from the person you knew I used to be.</t2082> <t2083>I have changed, and just a touch of Sibyl Vane's hand is enough to make me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful theories.”</t2083>
<t2084>"And that is...?" Lord Henry asked, serving himself some salad.</t2084>
<t2085>“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories about pleasure.</t2085> <t2086>In fact, all your theories, Harry.”</t2086>
<t2087>“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he replied, in his slow, melodious voice.</t2087> <t2088>“But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory as my own.</t2088> <t2089>It belongs to Nature, not to me.</t2089> <t2090>Pleasure is Nature's test, her sign of approval.</t2090> <t2091>When we are happy, we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.”</t2091>
<t2092>“Oh! But what do you mean by kindness?” Basil Hallward exclaimed.</t2092>
<t2093>“Yes,” Dorian repeated, leaning back in his chair, and looking at Lord Henry over the heavy bunches of purple-lipped irises placed in the middle of the table, “what do you mean by kindness, Harry?”</t2093>
<t2094>“Living kindly means living in harmony with oneself,” he replied, touching the slender stem of the glass with his pale, delicate fingers.</t2094> <t2095>“Disagreement means being forced to live in harmony with others.</t2095> <t2096>One's own life — that is what matters.</t2096> <t2097>As for the lives of those around us, if we wish to become disdainful or strict, we can flaunt our moral views about them, but they are not our concern.</t2097> <t2098>Moreover, true Individualism has a higher purpose.</t2098> <t2099>Modern virtue lies in accepting the standards of our time.</t2099> <t2100>I believe that for any cultured person, accepting the standards of his time is the most blatant form of immorality.”</t2100>
<t2101>"But surely if we live only for ourselves, Harry, we will have to pay a terrible price for it, won't we?" the artist suggested</t2101><t2102>.</t2102>
<t2103>“Yes, we have to pay too high a price for everything these days.</t2103> <t2104>I think the real tragedy of the poor is that they cannot afford to do anything except sacrifice.</t2104> <t2105>Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of the rich.”</t2105>
<t2106>“I have to pay in ways other than money.</t2106><t2107>”</t2107>
<t2108>“What kind of method is that, Basil?”</t2108>
<t2109>"Oh! I believe that through repentance, through suffering, through... yes, through the awareness of degradation."</t2109><t2110>"</t2110>
<t2111>Lord Henry shrugged.</t2111> <t2112>“My friend, medieval art is truly beautiful, but medieval emotions are outdated.</t2112> <t2113>One can use them in novels, of course.</t2113> <t2114>But on the other hand, the only things one can use in novels are those that people have stopped using in reality.</t2114> <t2115>Believe me, no civilized person has ever regretted a pleasure, and no uncivilized person has ever known what pleasure is.”</t2115>
<t2116>“I know what pleasure is,” Dorian Gray exclaimed. “It is to adore someone.”</t2116>
<t2117>“That is certainly better than being worshipped,” he replied, playing with some fruit. “Being worshipped is a terrible nuisance.</t2117> <t2118>Women treat me just like humans treat their gods.</t2118> <t2119>They worship me, and always bother me to do something for them.”</t2119>
<t2120>“I must say that whatever they ask of us, they have already given us first,” the young man murmured solemnly.</t2120> <t2121>“They created Love within our nature.</t2121> <t2122>They have the right to demand it back.”</t2122>
<t2123>"That is absolutely true, Dorian," Hallward exclaimed.</t2123>
<t2124>“Nothing has ever been completely right,” Lord Henry said.</t2124>
<t2125>"This is it," Dorian interrupted.</t2125> <t2126>"You must admit, Harry, that women give men the very gold of their lives."</t2126>
<t2127>“It’s possible,” he sighed, “but they always want it to return to its original state.”</t2127> <t2128>“That is the worrying thing.”</t2128> <t2129>“Women, as some witty Frenchman once said, inspire in us the desire to create masterpieces, and always prevent us from achieving them.”</t2129>
<t2130>“Harry, you are really scary! I don't understand why I like you so much.</t2130><t2131>”</t2131>
<t2132>“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied.</t2132> <t2133>“Shall we have some coffee, friends? —</t2133> <t2134>Waiter, bring coffee, fine-champagne, and a few cigarettes.</t2134> <t2135>No: never mind the cigarettes; I still have some.</t2135> <t2136>Basil, I can't let you smoke cigars.</t2136> <t2137>You must smoke a cigarette.</t2137> <t2138>A cigarette is the perfect example of a perfect pleasure.</t2138> <t2139>It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.</t2139> <t2140>What more could one want? Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me.</t2140> <t2141>To you, I represent all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.”</t2141>
<t2142>“What nonsense are you talking about, Harry!” the young man shouted, lighting a cigarette from the silver dragon that his servant had placed on the table.</t2142> <t2143>“Let's go down to the theater. When Sybil takes the stage, you will have a new ideal about life.</t2143> <t2144>To you, she will represent something that you have never known before.”</t2144>
<t2145>"I already know everything," Lord Henry said, with a weary look in his eyes, "but I am always ready to wait for a new emotion.</t2145> <t2146>However, I still fear that, for me, there is no such thing.</t2146> <t2147>But who knows, your wonderful girl might be able to move me.</t2147> <t2148>I love acting.</t2148> <t2149>It is much more real than life.</t2149> <t2150>Let's go.</t2150> <t2151>Dorian, you will come with me.</t2151> <t2152>I am very sorry, Basil, there is only one double seat on that hansom cab.</t2152> <t2153>You will have to follow us in the two-wheeled carriage."</t2153>
<t2154>They stood up and put on their coats, drinking sips of coffee.</t2154> <t2155>The artist was silent and absent-minded.</t2155> <t2156>A melancholy ruled over him.</t2156> <t2157>He couldn't bear this marriage, but he felt it seemed much better than many other things that could possibly happen.</t2157> <t2158>After a few minutes, all of them went downstairs.</t2158> <t2159>He walked by himself, as arranged, and watched the twinkling lights of the small one-horse carriage in front of him.</t2159> <t2160>A different kind of sense of loss overwhelmed him.</t2160> <t2161>He felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him what he had been in the past.</t2161> <t2162>Life had come between them... His eyes darkened, and the bustling, brightly lit streets blurred before him.</t2162> <t2163>When the carriage stopped in front of the theater, he felt as if he had aged many years.</t2163>
<t2164>Chapter 7</t2164>
<t2165>For some unknown reason, the theater was packed that night, and the fat Jewish manager who met them at the door had a wide, beaming, sycophantic, and hesitant smile.</t2165> <t2166>He escorted them to their box with an exaggeratedly humble attitude, waving his fat hand adorned with jewels, and speaking in the loudest voice.</t2166> <t2167>Dorian Gray hated him more than ever.</t2167> <t2168>He felt as if he had come to find Miranda only to be greeted by Caliban.</t2168> <t2169>However, Lord Henry rather liked him.</t2169> <t2170>At least he declared that he did, repeatedly shaking the manager's hand, and assuring him that he was very proud to meet the man who had discovered a true genius and had once gone bankrupt because of a poet.</t2170> <t2171>Hallward amused himself by observing the faces in the second-class section.</t2171> <t2172>The heat was terribly stifling, and the giant sun shone brightly like a massive dahlia with blazing golden petals.</t2172> <t2173>The young men in the gallery seats had taken off their coats and vests and draped them over the sides.</t2173> <t2174>They talked to each other across the theater and shared oranges with the garishly dressed girls sitting next to them.</t2174> <t2175>Some women laughed in the second-class section.</t2175> <t2176>Their voices were terribly shrill and piercing.</t2176> <t2177>The popping sounds of corks echoed from the bar.</t2177>
<t2178>“What a place to find a saint!” Lord Henry said.</t2178>
<t2179>“Yes!” Dorian Gray replied. “This is where I found her, and she is divine, far surpassing any creature.</t2179> <t2180>When she performs, you will forget everything.</t2180> <t2181>The ordinary, rude, coarse-faced, and clumsy people will become entirely different when she is on stage.</t2181> <t2182>They sit still watching her.</t2182> <t2183>They laugh and cry whenever she wants them to.</t2183> <t2184>She makes them sensitive like a violin.</t2184> <t2185>She elevates them, and you feel that they are of the same flesh and blood as yourself.”</t2185>
<t2186>“Also made of the same flesh and blood as myself! Oh, I hope not!” Lord Henry exclaimed, as he was watching the gallery patrons through the opera glasses.</t2186>
<t2187>“Don't pay any attention to him, Dorian,” the artist said.</t2187> <t2188>“I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl.</t2188> <t2189>Anyone you love must be wonderful, and any girl who can have the influence you describe must be beautiful and noble.</t2189> <t2190>Elevating our era — that is a very worthwhile endeavor.</t2190> <t2191>If this girl can breathe life into those who have lived without it, if she can create an appreciation for beauty in those whose lives have been mean and ugly, if she can drain selfishness from them and pour into them tears for sorrows that are not their own, then she deserves all your adoration, she deserves the adoration of the whole world.</t2191> <t2192>This marriage is entirely right.</t2192> <t2193>At first, I did not think so, but now I admit it.</t2193> <t2194>The gods have made Sibyl Vane for you.</t2194> <t2195>Without her, you would be incomplete.”</t2195>
<t2196>“Thank you, Basil,” Dorian Gray replied, gripping his hand tightly.</t2196> <t2197>“I knew you would understand me.</t2197> <t2198>Harry is so mocking, he terrifies me.</t2198> <t2199>But this is the orchestra.</t2199> <t2200>It is indeed frightening, but it only lasts about five minutes.</t2200> <t2201>Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am about to dedicate my whole life, the girl to whom I have dedicated everything good in me.”</t2201>
<t2202>A quarter of an hour later, amid unusually loud applause, Sibyl Vane stepped onto the stage.</t2202> <t2203>Yes, she truly looked beautiful — one of the most beautiful creations, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever seen.</t2203> <t2204>There was something very innocent in her shy grace and startled eyes.</t2204> <t2205>A slight blush of shyness, like the shadow of a rose in a silver mirror, appeared on her cheeks as she glanced at the packed, enthusiastic theater.</t2205> <t2206>She took a few steps back, and her lips seemed to tremble.</t2206> <t2207>Basil Hallward stood up abruptly and began to clap.</t2207> <t2208>Motionless, as if in a dream, Dorian Gray sat, staring at her.</t2208> <t2209>Lord Henry observed through his binoculars, muttering, “Charming! Charming!”</t2209>
<t2210>The scene is the Capulet's hall, and Romeo, dressed as a pilgrim, enters with Mercutio and his other friends. The orchestra, still as bad as before, starts playing a few bars of music, and the dance begins.</t2210> <t2211>Through the crowd of clumsy, poorly dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moves like a creature from a nobler world.</t2211> <t2212>Her body sways, as she dances, like a tree swaying in the water.</t2212> <t2213>The curves of her throat are like the curves of a white lily flower.</t2213> <t2214>Her hands seem to be carved from cool ivory.</t2214>
<t2215>But she was strangely absent-minded.</t2215> <t2216>She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested on Romeo. A few words she had to say...</t2216>
<t2217>Kind pilgrim, do not harm your mortal arm,</t2217>
<t2218>But there arises a reverence for goodness there;</t2218>
<t2219>By the angels' hands that he has touched,</t2219>
<t2220>And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss...</t2220>
<t2221>The short dialogue that followed was spoken with an extremely artificial attitude.</t2221> <t2222>The voice was great, but in terms of tone, it was completely wrong.</t2222> <t2223>It was also off in terms of nuance.</t2223> <t2224>It drained the life out of the poem.</t2224> <t2225>It made the passion seem hollow.</t2225>
<t2226>Dorian Gray turned pale as he watched her.</t2226> <t2227>He was confused and anxious.</t2227> <t2228>Both of his friends did not dare to say anything to him.</t2228> <t2229>They found her seemingly completely incompetent.</t2229> <t2230>They were terribly disappointed.</t2230>
<t2231>They felt that the true test for any Juliet was the balcony scene in act two.</t2231> <t2232>They waited for that moment.</t2232> <t2233>If she failed there, then she had no talent at all.</t2233>
<t2234>She looked very charming as she stepped out under the moonlight.</t2234> <t2235>That cannot be denied.</t2235> <t2236>But the theatricality in her performance was unbearable, and it worsened as she continued.</t2236> <t2237>Her gestures became ridiculously artificial.</t2237> <t2238>She overemphasized everything she had to say.</t2238> <t2239>The beautiful verse:</t2239>
<t2240>He knows the night veil is covering your face,</t2240>
<t2241>Otherwise, the rosy hue of youth would have already colored your cheeks</t2241>
<t2242>Because of what you heard me say tonight...</t2242>
<t2243>Recited with the laborious precision of a schoolgirl who had once been taught to memorize by some second-rate elocution teacher.</t2243> <t2244>When she leaned over the balcony and came to these wonderful lines:</t2244>
<t2245>Even if you are happy beside him,</t2245>
<t2246>I'm not happy with tonight's deal:</t2246>
<t2247>It was too hasty, too reckless, too abrupt;</t2247>
<t2248>Too similar to lightning, the thing that was lost</t2248>
<t2249>Before I could speak, "lightning struck."</t2249> <t2250>My dear, sleep well!</t2250>
<t2251>Wishing that this bud of love ripens from the lush breath of summer</t2251>
<t2252>It will bloom into a beautiful flower when we meet again...</t2252>
<t2253>She spoke the words as if they conveyed no meaning to her.</t2253> <t2254>It was not confusion.</t2254> <t2255>In fact, far from being confused, she was completely in control.</t2255> <t2256>It was simply bad art.</t2256> <t2257>She was a complete failure.</t2257>
<t2258>Even the common, uneducated audience members in the second tier and the chicken coop section lost interest in the play.</t2258> <t2259>They fidgeted constantly, started talking loudly, and whistling.</t2259> <t2260>The Jewish impresario, who had been standing deep in the balcony, stomped his feet and cursed angrily.</t2260> <t2261>The only person who remained indifferent was the girl herself.</t2261>
<t2262>When the second act ended, a whistling storm arose, and Lord Henry got up from his seat and put on his coat.</t2262> <t2263>“She is very beautiful, Dorian,” he said, “but she cannot act.</t2263> <t2264>Let's go.”</t2264>
<t2265>“I will watch until the end of the play,” the young man replied, in a harsh, bitter voice.</t2265> <t2266>“I am very sorry that I made you waste the entire evening, Harry. I apologize to both of you.”</t2266>
<t2267>“My dear Dorian, I suppose Miss Vane is ill,” Hallward interrupted.</t2267> <t2268>“We will come another night.”</t2268>
<t2269>“I also hope she is ill,” he replied.</t2269> <t2270>“But it seems to me that she is completely numb and cold.</t2270> <t2271>She has changed completely.</t2271> <t2272>Just the other night she was a great artist.</t2272> <t2273>Tonight she is just a mediocre, second-rate actress.”</t2273>
<t2274>“Don't speak that way about anyone you love, Dorian.</t2274> <t2275>Love is a more wonderful thing than Art.”</t2275>
<t2276>“Both are merely forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry.</t2276> <t2277>“But let's go now.</t2277> <t2278>Dorian, you shouldn't stay here any longer.</t2278> <t2279>Watching bad acting is not good for the spirit.</t2279> <t2280>Besides, I don't believe you would want your wife to act.</t2280> <t2281>So if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll, what does it matter?</t2281> <t2282>She is very beautiful, and assuming she knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be an interesting experience.</t2282> <t2283>There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating — those who know everything, and those who know nothing.</t2283> <t2284>Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unsuitable.</t2284> <t2285>Come to the club with Basil and me.</t2285> <t2286>We will smoke cigarettes and toast to the beauty of Sibyl Vane.</t2286> <t2287>She is truly beautiful.</t2287> <t2288>What more could you want?”</t2288>
<t2289>"Go away, Harry," the young man cried out. "I want to be alone.</t2289> <t2290>Basil, you should go too.</t2290> <t2291>Oh! Can't you see that my heart is breaking?</t2291> <t2292>Tears welled up in his eyes.</t2292> <t2293>His lips trembled, and, rushing deep into the box, he leaned against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.</t2293>
<t2294>"Let's go, Basil," Lord Henry said, with a different kind of gentleness in his voice; and the two young men went out together.</t2294>
<t2295>A few minutes later, the stage lights flared up, and the curtain rose for the third act. Dorian Gray returned to his seat.</t2295> <t2296>He looked pale, arrogant, indifferent.</t2296> <t2297>The play seemed to drag on endlessly.</t2297> <t2298>Half the audience left, dragging their heavy-shoed feet and laughing mockingly.</t2298> <t2299>The whole affair was a failure.</t2299> <t2300>The final act was performed before nearly empty rows of seats.</t2300> <t2301>The curtain fell amidst a few giggles and murmurs of disapproval.</t2301>
<t2302>Right after it was over, Dorian Gray rushed backstage, into the break room.</t2302> <t2303>The girl stood there alone, with a joyful expression.</t2303> <t2304>Her eyes shone with a beautiful fire.</t2304> <t2305>An aura surrounded her.</t2305> <t2306>Her slightly parted lips smiled with some private secret.</t2306>
<t2307>When he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of boundless joy appeared on her face.</t2307> <t2308>“Why did you perform so poorly tonight, Dorian!” she exclaimed.</t2308>
<t2309>“Terrible!” he replied, looking at her in astonishment — “terrible! Truly horrifying.</t2309> <t2310>Are you sick? You can't imagine what it's like.</t2310> <t2311>You can't imagine what I have to endure.”</t2311>
<t2312>The girl laughed.</t2312> <t2313>“Dorian,” she replied, lingering on his name with a musical tone in her voice, as if it were sweeter than honey on the crimson petals of her lips — "Dorian, you should have understood.</t2313> <t2314>But now you do, don't you?”</t2314>
<t2315>“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.</t2315>
<t2316>“Why were you so bad tonight.</t2316> <t2317>Why will you always be bad.</t2317> <t2318>Why will you never be able to perform well again.”</t2318>
<t2319>He shrugged.</t2319> <t2320>"You're sick, I think so.</t2320> <t2321>When you're sick, you shouldn't perform.</t2321> <t2322>You make yourself look ridiculous.</t2322> <t2323>My friends are sad.</t2323> <t2324>I'm sad too."</t2324>
<t2325>She seemed not to hear him.</t2325> <t2326>She was radiant with joy.</t2326> <t2327>An enchanting happiness dominated her.</t2327>
<t2328>“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was a reality of my life.</t2328> <t2329>Only in the theater did I truly live.</t2329> <t2330>I thought it was all true.</t2330> <t2331>I was Rosalind one night, Portia another.</t2331> <t2332>Beatrice's joy was my joy, Cordelia's sorrow belonged to me as well.</t2332> <t2333>I believed it all.</t2333> <t2334>It seemed to me that the mortals who acted with me were like gods.</t2334> <t2335>The painted scenery was my world.</t2335> <t2336>I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought they were real.</t2336> <t2337>You came — oh, my exquisite love! — and you freed my soul from its prison.</t2337> <t2338>You taught me what reality truly is.</t2338> <t2339>Tonight, for the first time in my life, I saw through the emptiness, the pretense, the foolishness of the meaningless spectacle in which I had always acted.</t2339> <t2340>Tonight, for the first time, I realized that Romeo is disgusting, old, painted, that the moonlight in the garden is fake, that the scenery is trivial, that the words I had to say were hollow, not my own, not what I wanted to say.</t2340>
<t2341>You have brought me something greater, something that all art is merely a reflection of.</t2341><t2342>You have made me understand what love truly is.</t2342><t2343>My love!</t2343><t2344>My love! Prince Charming!</t2344><t2345>Prince of life! I am sick of shadows.</t2345><t2346>To me, you are above all the art in the world that has ever existed.</t2346><t2347>What should I do with the puppets in the play?</t2347><t2348>When I went to the theater tonight, I couldn't understand why everything left me.</t2348><t2349>I thought I would perform wonderfully.</t2349><t2350>I found that I couldn't do anything at all.</t2350><t2351>Suddenly my heart realized what all this meant.</t2351><t2352>That realization was wonderful to me.</t2352><t2353>I heard them whistle, and I laughed.</t2353><t2354>What could they know about a love like ours?</t2354><t2355>Take me away, Dorian — take me away with you, to a place where it's just the two of us.</t2355><t2356>I hate the stage.</t2356><t2357>I can mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic something that has burned me like fire.</t2357><t2358>Oh, Dorian, Dorian, do you understand now what it means?</t2358><t2359>Even if I could, I would still find acting out love scenes an insult.</t2359><t2360>You have made me realize that.</t2360>
<t2361>He let himself fall onto the sofa and turned away. "You have killed my love," he whispered.</t2361> <t2362>She looked at him in surprise and laughed.</t2362> <t2363>He did not respond.</t2363> <t2364>She approached him, gently stroking his hair with her small fingers.</t2364> <t2365>She knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips.</t2365> <t2366>He pulled them away, a shiver running through him.</t2366>
<t2367>Then he stood up abruptly and walked to the door.</t2367> <t2368>“Yes,” he cried out, “you have killed my love.</t2368> <t2369>You once stirred my imagination.</t2369> <t2370>Now you don't even arouse my curiosity.</t2370> <t2371>You simply don't make any impression at all.</t2371> <t2372>I loved you because you were marvelous, because you had genius and intellect, because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art.</t2372> <t2373>You have thrown it all away.</t2373> <t2374>You are empty and dull.</t2374> <t2375>God! How madly I loved you! How foolish I was!</t2375> <t2376>Now you are nothing to me.</t2376> <t2377>I will never see you again. I will never think of you again. I will never mention your name again.</t2377> <t2378>You don't know what you were to me, before.</t2378> <t2379>How, before... Oh, I can't bear to think about it! I wish I had never laid eyes on you! You have ruined the dreams of my life.</t2379> <t2380>How can you understand so little about love, if you say it ruins your art!</t2380> <t2381>Without art, you are nothing.</t2381> <t2382>I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent.</t2382> <t2383>The world would have worshipped you, and you would have borne my name.</t2383> <t2384>What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty face.”</t2384>
<t2385>The girl turned pale and trembled.</t2385> <t2386>She clasped her hands tightly together, and her voice seemed to catch in her throat.</t2386> <t2387>“You can't be serious, Dorian?” she whispered.</t2387> <t2388>“You are acting.”</t2388>
<t2389>"Act! I'll leave that job to you.</t2389> <t2390>You do it so well," he replied bitterly.</t2390>
<t2391>She sat up, and, with a look of pitiable pain on her face, walked across the room to him.</t2391> <t2392>She placed her hand on his arm, looking into his eyes.</t2392> <t2393>He pushed her back. “Don't touch me!” he shouted.</t2393>
<t2394>A faint moan escaped from her, and she fell at his feet, lying there like a trampled flower. “Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!” she whispered.</t2394> <t2395>“I am so sorry that I did not perform well.</t2395> <t2396>I think of you all the time.</t2396> <t2397>But I will try — really, I will try.</t2397> <t2398>How suddenly it came to me, the love I have for you.</t2398> <t2399>I think I would never have known it if you had not kissed me — if we had not kissed each other.</t2399> <t2400>Kiss me again, my love. Don't leave me.</t2400> <t2401>I can't bear it.</t2401> <t2402>Oh! Don't leave me.</t2402> <t2403>My brother… No; don't worry.</t2403> <t2404>It means nothing.</t2404> <t2405>He was just joking…</t2405> <t2406>But you, oh! Can't you forgive me for tonight?</t2406> <t2407>I will do my best, and try to improve. Don't be cruel to me because I love you more than anything in the world.</t2407> <t2408>After all, it is only this one time that I have not pleased you.</t2408> <t2409>But you are entirely right, Dorian.</t2409> <t2410>I should not have shown myself more than an actress.</t2410> <t2411>That was my foolishness; yet I could not help it.</t2411> <t2412>Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me.” An earnest sob choked her.</t2412> <t2413>She bent over the floor like a wounded animal, while Dorian Gray, with his beautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in extreme disdain.</t2413> <t2414>There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of those whom one has ceased to love.</t2414> <t2415>He found Sibyl Vane to be absurdly melodramatic.</t2415> <t2416>Her tears and sobs irritated him.</t2416>
<t2417>“I'm leaving,” he finally said, in his calm, clear voice.</t2417> <t2418>“I don't want to become cruel, but I can't see you again.</t2418> <t2419>You have made me bored.</t2419><t2420>”</t2420>
<t2421>She cried silently, not responding, but crawled closer.</t2421> <t2422>Her small hands reached out, seemingly to find him.</t2422> <t2423>He turned on his heel and left the room.</t2423> <t2424>After a few minutes, he was out of the theater.</t2424>
<t2425>You hardly knew where you were going.</t2425> <t2426>You remembered wandering through dimly lit streets, past deserted archways shrouded in darkness, and houses that looked very sinister.</t2426> <t2427>Women with hoarse voices and shrill laughter called out to you.</t2427> <t2428>Drunken men staggered by, cursing and muttering to themselves like giant monkeys. You saw strange children huddled together on doorsteps, and heard shouts and curses from gloomy courtyards.</t2428>
<t2429>When dawn just broke, he found himself near Covent Garden.</t2429> <t2430>The darkness had dissipated, and, tinged pink by the pale fire, the sky curved into a perfect pearl.</t2430> <t2431>Huge horse-drawn carriages loaded with nodding lilies were clattering slowly down the shiny empty street.</t2431> <t2432>The air was fragrant with flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him a soothing balm for his pain.</t2432> <t2433>He followed into the market, watching people unload the carriages.</t2433> <t2434>A coachman in a white coat offered him some cherries.</t2434> <t2435>He thanked him, wondering why he refused to accept even a penny for them, and began to eat them indifferently.</t2435> <t2436>They had been picked at midnight, and the cold moonlight had seeped into them.</t2436> <t2437>A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips and yellow with red roses marched in front of him, weaving their way through the massive emerald-green heaps of vegetables.</t2437> <t2438>Under the archway, with columns bleached gray by the sun, a group of girls with dirt-smeared bare heads were lingering, waiting for the auction to end.</t2438> <t2439>Other crowds gathered around the revolving doors of the coffee shop on the terrace.</t2439> <t2440>Heavy pack horses were both slipping and stamping on the rough stones, jingling their harnesses and saddles.</t2440> <t2441>Some coachmen were sleeping on piles of sacks.</t2441> <t2442>With rainbow necks and pink feet, the pigeons were scurrying around pecking at seeds.</t2442>
<t2443>A moment later, he called for a two-wheeled carriage and hurried home.</t2443> <t2444>For several minutes, he lingered on the doorstep, looking around the quiet square with its bare windows, tightly shut shutters, and exposed curtains. The sky now resembled a pure cat's eye gem, and the rooftops glittered like silver against the sky.</t2444> <t2445>From a chimney opposite, a thin wisp of smoke rose.</t2445> <t2446>It curled, a purple ribbon, through the pearlescent air.</t2446>
<t2447>In the massive gold-plated Venetian lantern, once seized from the flagship of some governor, now hanging from the ceiling of the large oak-paneled hall, the lights still burned from three flickering nozzles: they looked like thin blue petals of fire, edged with white flames.</t2447> <t2448>He extinguished them, and, after tossing his hat and cloak onto the table, walked through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a vast octagonal room on the ground floor that, in accordance with his newly developed sense of luxury, he had just redecorated, hanging a few rare Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in an abandoned attic at Selby Royal. As he turned the doorknob, his eyes caught sight of the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him.</t2448> <t2449>He recoiled in surprise.</t2449> <t2450>Then he stepped into his room, looking somewhat bewildered.</t2450> <t2451>After unbuttoning his coat, he seemed to hesitate.</t2451> <t2452>Finally, he turned back, approached the painting, and examined it closely.</t2452> <t2453>In the dim light filtered through the cream-colored silk curtains, the face before him had changed a little.</t2453> <t2454>The expression looked different.</t2454> <t2455>One might say there was something cruel about the mouth.</t2455> <t2456>This was very strange.</t2456>
<t2457>He turned around, and, walking to the window, pulled up the curtain.</t2457> <t2458>The radiant dawn flooded into the room, sweeping the grotesque shadows into the dark corners where they lay trembling.</t2458> <t2459>But the strange feature he noticed on the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, even appearing more pronounced.</t2459> <t2460>The shimmering, scorching sunlight revealed the merciless wrinkles around the mouth as clearly as if he were looking into a mirror after doing something very bad.</t2460>
<t2461>He drew back, and, picking up from the table an oval mirror framed with ivory Cupids, one of the many gifts Lord Henry had given him, hurriedly looked into its glossy depths.</t2461> <t2462>There was no wrinkle such as the one that had distorted his red lips.</t2462> <t2463>What did it mean?</t2463>
<t2464>He rubbed his eyes, approached the painting, and examined it closely.</t2464> <t2465>There were no signs of any repairs when he looked at the actual paint layer, yet it was certain that the entire expression had changed.</t2465> <t2466>It was not just his own imagination.</t2466> <t2467>That was terribly obvious.</t2467>
<t2468>He dropped himself into the chair and began to think.</t2468> <t2469>Suddenly, the words he had spoken in Basil Hallward's studio on the day the painting was completed flashed through his mind.</t2469> <t2470>Yes, he remembered them vividly.</t2470> <t2471>He had uttered a wild wish that he himself would remain young while the portrait aged; that his beauty would not fade, while the face on the canvas bore the burden of his passions and sins; that the painted image would wither with the lines of suffering and thought, while he retained all the freshness and charm of youth that he had just become conscious of at that time.</t2471> <t2472>Was it certain that his wish had not been fulfilled?</t2472> <t2473>Such things could not happen.</t2473> <t2474>Even thinking about them seemed bizarre.</t2474> <t2475>Yet, the painting was before him, with a cruel expression on its mouth.</t2475>
<t2476>Ruthless! Are you ruthless?</t2476> <t2477>It was the girl's fault, not yours.</t2477> <t2478>You dreamed of her as a great artist, offered your love to her because you thought she was great.</t2478> <t2479>Yet she bored you.</t2479> <t2480>She was shallow and unworthy.</t2480> <t2481>However, an immense sense of regret took over you when you thought of her lying at your feet, sobbing like a child.</t2481> <t2482>You remember how ruthlessly you observed her.</t2482> <t2483>Why were you made this way? Why was such a soul given to you?</t2483> <t2484>But you also suffered.</t2484> <t2485>Throughout the three terrible hours that the play lasted, you lived through centuries of pain, countless years of agony.</t2485> <t2486>Your life was as valuable as hers.</t2486> <t2487>She also ruined you for a moment, if you hurt her for a century. Besides, women are more accustomed to pain than men.</t2487> <t2488>They live by their emotions.</t2488> <t2489>They only think about their emotions.</t2489> <t2490>When they choose a lover, it's just to have someone to quarrel with.</t2490> <t2491>Lord Henry told you so, and Lord Henry knows what women are like.</t2491> <t2492>Why should you care about Sibyl Vane? She is nothing to you now.</t2492>
<t2493>But what about the painting? What did you say about it?</t2493> <t2494>It holds the secret of your life, recounts your story.</t2494> <t2495>It taught you to love your own beauty.</t2495> <t2496>Did it teach you to hate your soul?</t2496> <t2497>Do you ever look at it again?</t2497>
<t2498>No; it is merely an illusion crafted by chaotic sensations.</t2498> <t2499>The terrible night you experienced still leaves behind its ghosts.</t2499> <t2500>Suddenly, a tiny bright red spot dropped in your brain, still capable of driving a person mad.</t2500> <t2501>The painting remains unchanged.</t2501> <t2502>Thinking that is truly ridiculous.</t2502>
<t2503>However, it still observed him, with a beautiful face that had been marred and a cruel smile.</t2503> <t2504>Its radiant hair glowed in the early sunlight.</t2504> <t2505>Its blue eyes met his.</t2505> <t2506>An overwhelming sense of pity, not for him, but for the drawing of himself, consumed him.</t2506> <t2507>It had already transformed, and would continue to transform.</t2507> <t2508>Its golden hue would wither into gray.</t2508> <t2509>The red and white roses would die.</t2509> <t2510>For every sin he committed, a blemish would mar and spoil its beauty.</t2510> <t2511>But he would not sin.</t2511> <t2512>The painting, whether changed or unchanged, would still be a tangible symbol of his conscience.</t2512> <t2513>He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry again — would not, in any case, listen to the insidious, poisonous theories that had first stirred in him a passion for the impossible in Basil Hallward's garden.</t2513> <t2514>He would return to Sibyl Vane, make amends to her, marry her, and try to love her again.</t2514> <t2515>Yes, that was his duty.</t2515> <t2516>She must have endured more suffering than he had.</t2516> <t2517>Poor girl! He had been selfish and cruel to her.</t2517> <t2518>The charm that she had once tormented him with would return.</t2518> <t2519>They would be happy together.</t2519> <t2520>His life with her would be beautiful and pure.</t2520>
<t2521>He stood up from the chair, pulled the large curtain right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he looked at it.</t2521> <t2522>“Horrifying!” he muttered to himself and walked over to the window, then opened it.</t2522> <t2523>When he stepped outside, onto the grass, he took a deep breath.</t2523> <t2524>The fresh morning air seemed to dispel all his gloomy passions.</t2524> <t2525>He thought only of Sibyl.</t2525> <t2526>A faint echo of love had returned to him.</t2526> <t2527>He repeated her name over and over.</t2527> <t2528>The birds singing in the dew-laden garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.</t2528>
<t2529>Chapter 8</t2529>
<t2530>It was long past noon when he woke up.</t2530> <t2531>The servant had tiptoed into the room several times to see if he was awake yet, wondering what had caused his master to sleep so late.</t2531> <t2532>Finally, the bell rang, and Victor gently entered with a cup of tea, a stack of letters, on a small antique Sèvres porcelain tray, and drew back the olive satin curtains, lined with shimmering blue, hanging in front of the three tall windows.</t2532>
<t2533>“You slept well this morning, sir,” he said, smiling.</t2533>
<t2534>"What time is it, Victor?" Dorian Gray asked, absent-mindedly.</t2534>
<t2535>“It’s one fifteen already, sir.”</t2535> <t2536>It was really late! He sat up, and, after sipping some tea, turned to the letters.</t2536> <t2537>One of them was from Lord Henry, delivered by hand this morning.</t2537> <t2538>He hesitated for a moment, then set it aside.</t2538> <t2539>The other letters he opened indifferently.</t2539> <t2540>They included the usual collection of calling cards, dinner invitations, private exhibition tickets, charity concert programs, and the like, the things that are incessantly sent to fashionable young men every morning during the season.</t2540> <t2541>There was a rather hefty bill for a silver-gilt dressing set in the style of Louis XV, which he had not yet had the courage to send to his guardians, who were exceedingly old-fashioned and unaware that we live in an age where the unnecessary are our only necessities; there were also a few very politely presented notices from moneylenders on Jermyn Street offering to lend any amount of money immediately and at the most reasonable rates of interest.</t2541>
<t2542>About ten minutes later, he stood up, hastily put on a meticulously tailored cashmere coat embroidered with silk, and went into the agate-tiled bathroom.</t2542> <t2543>The cold water refreshed him after the long sleep.</t2543> <t2544>He seemed to have forgotten everything he had just gone through.</t2544> <t2545>A vague feeling of having participated in some strange tragedy came to him a few times, but there was something unreal about the dream of it.</t2545>
<t2546>Right after putting on his clothes, he went into the library and sat down to a light French breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table near the wide-open window.</t2546> <t2547>It was a beautiful day.</t2547> <t2548>The warm air seemed to be rich with flavor.</t2548> <t2549>A bee flew in, buzzing around the porcelain bowl decorated with blue dragons, filled with sulfur-yellow roses, placed in front of him.</t2549> <t2550>He felt extremely happy.</t2550>
<t2551>Suddenly, his eyes noticed the shield he had placed in front of the portrait, and he was startled.</t2551>
<t2552>"Are you too cold, sir?" the servant asked, placing the omelette on the table.</t2552> <t2553>"Shall I close the window?"</t2553>
<t2554>Dorian shook his head. "I'm not cold," he muttered.</t2554>
<t2555>Is all of this really true?</t2555> <t2556>Did the portrait really change?</t2556> <t2557>Or was it just your own imagination that made you see the evil where there once was joy?</t2557> <t2558>Surely a painted canvas cannot change, right? This is really absurd.</t2558> <t2559>It could be used as a story to tell Basil someday.</t2559> <t2560>It would make him laugh.</t2560>
<t2561>However, how vivid his memory of the whole incident was! At first, it was in the dim darkness, then in the bright dawn, he saw the cruel expression around the distorted lips.</t2561> <t2562>He was almost afraid of the servant leaving the room.</t2562> <t2563>He knew that at that moment he would be alone and perhaps he would check the portrait.</t2563> <t2564>He feared certainty.</t2564> <t2565>When the coffee and cigarettes had been brought in and the servant turned away, he felt a mad desire to tell him to stay.</t2565> <t2566>As the door was closing behind him, he called him back.</t2566> <t2567>The servant stood waiting for his orders.</t2567> <t2568>Dorian looked at him for a moment.</t2568> <t2569>“I am not at home, Victor, to anyone,” he said, with a sigh.</t2569> <t2570>The servant bowed and withdrew.</t2570>
<t2571>Then he got up from the table, lit a cigarette, and let himself down onto the luxurious cushioned divan opposite the screen.</t2571> <t2572>The screen was an antique, made of gold-plated Spanish leather, embossed and crafted with a rather intricate design in the style of King Louis XV. He examined it curiously, wondering if it had ever concealed anyone's secrets before.</t2572>
<t2573>In the end, should you move it over there?</t2573> <t2574>Why not just leave it there?</t2574> <t2575>What good is knowing? If it's true, then it's too terrible.</t2575>
<t2576>If it isn't real, then why bother with it?</t2576> <t2577>But what if, due to fate or some fatal coincidence, eyes other than yours scrutinize it and see that terrible change?</t2577> <t2578>What would you do if Basil Hallward dropped by and demanded to see his painting?</t2578> <t2579>Basil would certainly do that.</t2579> <t2580>No; this thing must be checked again, immediately.</t2580> <t2581>Whatever happens, it would be better than this terrible state of suspicion.</t2581>
<t2582>He stood up and locked both doors.</t2582> <t2583>At least he would be alone when he looked at his shameful mask.</t2583> <t2584>Then he pulled the curtain aside and saw himself, face to face.</t2584> <t2585>It was true: the picture had changed.</t2585>
<t2586>As he often recalled later, and always with some surprise, he found himself initially gazing at the portrait with a sense of almost scientific fascination.</t2586> <t2587>Such a change occurring was something he found incredible.</t2587> <t2588>Yet it was the truth.</t2588> <t2589>Could there be some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms, which had arranged themselves into shape and color on the canvas, and his soul?</t2589> <t2590>Could it be that what his soul thought of would materialize? — and what it dreamed of would become reality?</t2590> <t2591>Or was there some other cause, more terrifying? He shuddered, feeling frightened, and, turning back to the couch, lay there, staring at the painting with a sickening dread.</t2591>
<t2592>However, he felt that there was one thing it had done for him.</t2592> <t2593>It had made him realize how unjust and cruel he had been to Sibyl Vane.</t2593> <t2594>It was not too late to make amends for that.</t2594> <t2595>She could still become his wife.</t2595> <t2596>His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would transform into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be his guide throughout life, would become to him what sanctity has become to some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God to all of us.</t2596> <t2597>There are opiates for remorse in this world, drugs that can lull the moral sense to sleep.</t2597> <t2598>But this was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin.</t2598> <t2599>This was an ever-present sign of the ruin that men bring upon their souls.</t2599>
<t2600>The clock struck three, then four, then its half-hour double chime rang, but Dorian Gray still did not move.</t2600> <t2601>He was trying to gather the bright red threads of life, to weave them into a pattern; to find his way through the blood-red labyrinth of passion that he was wandering through.</t2601> <t2602>He did not know what to do, or what to think.</t2602> <t2603>Eventually, he approached the table, wrote a passionate letter to the girl he loved, begging for her forgiveness, and accusing himself of madness.</t2603> <t2604>He poured out page after page of wild words about sorrow, and even wilder words about pain.</t2604> <t2605>There was a luxurious pleasure in self-reproach.</t2605> <t2606>When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has the right to blame us.</t2606> <t2607>It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.</t2607> <t2608>When Dorian finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.</t2608>
<t2609>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, and he heard Lord Henry's voice outside.</t2609> <t2610>“My dear boy, I must see you.</t2610> <t2611>Let me in at once.</t2611> <t2612>I can't bear you shutting yourself up like this.”</t2612>
<t2613>At first, he did not answer, but remained motionless.</t2613> <t2614>The knocking on the door continued, growing louder.</t2614> <t2615>Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, to explain to him about the new life he was about to live, to argue with him if an argument became necessary, to part ways if parting ways was unavoidable.</t2615> <t2616>He stood up abruptly, quickly drew the curtain across the painting, and unlocked the door.</t2616>
<t2617>"I am very sorry about all of this," Lord Henry said, as he walked in.</t2617> <t2618>"But you shouldn't think too much about it."</t2618>
<t2619>“Are you referring to Sibyl Vane?” the young man asked.</t2619>
<t2620>“Yes, of course,” Lord Henry replied, lowering himself into a chair and slowly removing his yellow gloves. “It's terrible, in a way, but it's not your fault.</t2620> <t2621>Tell me, did you go backstage and see her after the play ended?”</t2621>
<t2622>“Yes.”</t2622>
<t2623>“I'm sure you went.</t2623> <t2624>Did you have a quarrel with her?”</t2624>
<t2625>"I was really rough, Harry — extremely rough.</t2625> <t2626>But now everything is fine.</t2626> <t2627>I don't regret anything that happened.</t2627> <t2628>It taught me to understand myself better."</t2628>
<t2629>"Oh, Dorian, I am so glad you are taking this in such a way! I was afraid I would see you drowning in regret and tearing out that beautiful curly hair of yours."</t2629>
<t2630>"I have overcome all that," Dorian said, shaking his head and smiling.</t2630> <t2631>"At this moment, I am extremely happy.</t2631> <t2632>First of all, I have learned what a conscience is.</t2632> <t2633>It is not what you told me it was.</t2633> <t2634>It is the most sacred thing within us.</t2634> <t2635>Do not mock it, Harry, any further — at least not in front of me.</t2635> <t2636>I want to be a good person.</t2636> <t2637>I cannot bear the thought that my soul will become loathsome."</t2637>
<t2638>"A very graceful foundation of art for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you on that."</t2638> <t2639>"But how are you going to start?"</t2639>
<t2640>“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”</t2640>
<t2641>"Marry Sibyl Vane!" Lord Henry exclaimed, standing up, looking at him in astonishment and confusion.</t2641> <t2642>"But, my dear Dorian..."</t2642>
<t2643>“Yes, Harry, I know what you're about to say.</t2643> <t2644>Something terrible about marriage.</t2644> <t2645>Don't say it.</t2645> <t2646>Never say things like that to me again.</t2646> <t2647>Two days ago I proposed to Sibyl. I will not break my promise to her.</t2647> <t2648>She will be my wife!”</t2648>
<t2649>"Your wife! Dorian!..."</t2649> <t2650>"Did you receive my letter?"</t2650> <t2651>"I wrote to you this morning and sent it down with my man."</t2651>
<t2652>“Your letter? Ah, yes, I remember now.</t2652> <t2653>I haven't read it yet, Harry.</t2653> <t2654>I'm afraid there might be something in it that I don't like.</t2654> <t2655>You dissect life with your satirical maxims.”</t2655>
<t2656>"So you don't know anything yet?"</t2656>
<t2657>“What do you mean?”</t2657>
<t2658>Lord Henry walked across the room, and, sitting down beside Dorian Gray, took both of his hands in his own, holding them tightly.</t2658> <t2659>“Dorian,” he said, “my letter — don't be alarmed — is to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead.”</t2659>
<t2660>A cry of pain broke from the young man's lips, he stood up abruptly, pulling his hand away from Lord Henry's grasp.</t2660> <t2661>“Dead!</t2661> <t2662>Sibyl dead! No, that's a terrible lie!</t2662> <t2663>How dare you say that?”</t2663>
<t2664>"Really, Dorian," Lord Henry said, solemnly.</t2664> <t2665>"The news is in every morning paper.</t2665> <t2666>I wrote to you to ask you not to meet anyone before I arrive.</t2666> <t2667>There will have to be an investigation, of course, and you shouldn't be involved in it.</t2667> <t2668>Such matters make one fashionable in Paris. But in London, people are too prejudiced.</t2668> <t2669>Here, one shouldn't enter life with a scandal.</t2669> <t2670>We should save it to draw attention to our old age.</t2670> <t2671>I suppose they don't know your name at the theater? If they don't, then it's all right.</t2671> <t2672>Did anyone see you going around to her room?</t2672> <t2673>That is the crucial point."</t2673>
<t2674>Dorian did not respond for a moment.</t2674> <t2675>He was stunned with fear.</t2675> <t2676>Finally, he stammered in a choked voice, "Harry, did you say an investigation?</t2676> <t2677>What do you mean by that?</t2677> <t2678>Is it Sibyl...? Oh, Harry, I can't bear it!</t2678> <t2679>But hurry up.</t2679> <t2680>Tell me everything at once."</t2680>
<t2681>“I am certain it was not an accident, Dorian, although it had to be presented to the public that way.</t2681> <t2682>It seems that while she was leaving the theater with her mother, around half past twelve, she said she had forgotten something upstairs.</t2682> <t2683>They waited for her for a while, but she did not come back down.</t2683> <t2684>Eventually, they found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing room.</t2684> <t2685>She had accidentally ingested something, some terrible substance that they use in theaters.</t2685> <t2686>I don't know what it was, but it had either hydrocyanic acid or white lead in it.</t2686> <t2687>I assume it was hydrocyanic acid, because she seemed to have died instantly.”</t2687>
<t2688>“Harry, Harry, it's terrible!” the young man exclaimed.</t2688>
<t2689>"Yes; this matter is very tragic, of course, but you must not let yourself get involved in it.</t2689> <t2690>I saw in The Standard that she was seventeen years old.</t2690> <t2691>I thought she was younger than that.</t2691> <t2692>She looked like a child, and seemed to know very little about acting.</t2692> <t2693>Dorian, you must not let this get into your head.</t2693> <t2694>You must have dinner with me, and then we will drop by the opera house.</t2694> <t2695>Tonight is Patti's night, and everyone will be there.</t2695> <t2696>You can come to my sister's box.</t2696> <t2697>She is going with a few well-dressed ladies."</t2697>
<t2698>“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” Dorian Gray said, somewhat to himself — “murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.</t2698> <t2699>Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that.</t2699> <t2700>The birds sing just as happily in my garden.</t2700> <t2701>And tonight I am dining with you, then going to the opera, and I suppose, afterwards, we will go somewhere for supper.</t2701> <t2702>How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it.</t2702> <t2703>Somehow, now that it has actually happened, and to me, it seems too strange for tears.</t2703> <t2704>This is the first passionate love letter I have ever written in my life.</t2704> <t2705>Strangely enough, my first passionate love letter was addressed to a dead girl.</t2705> <t2706>Can they feel, I wonder, those silent, white people we call the dead?</t2706> <t2707>Sibyl! Can she feel, or understand, or listen?</t2707> <t2708>Oh, Harry, how I loved her once!</t2708> <t2709>It seems years ago now.</t2709> <t2710>She was everything to me.</t2710> <t2711>Then came that dreadful night — was it really only last night? — when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke.</t2711> <t2712>She explained it all to me.</t2712> <t2713>It was really pathetic.</t2713> <t2714>But I was not moved a bit.</t2714> <t2715>I thought her shallow.</t2715> <t2716>Suddenly something happened that made me afraid.</t2716> <t2717>I cannot tell you what it was, but it was terrible.</t2717> <t2718>I said I would go back to her.</t2718> <t2719>I felt I had done wrong.</t2719> <t2720>And now she is dead.</t2720> <t2721>God! God! Harry, what am I to do? You don’t know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight.</t2721> <t2722>She would have done that for me.</t2722> <t2723>She had no right to kill herself.</t2723> <t2724>It was selfish of her.”</t2724>
<t2725>“My dear Dorian,” Lord Henry replied, taking a cigarette from the box and holding out a gold-leaf matchbox, “the only way women have ever reformed men is by boring them so completely that they lose all possible interest in life.</t2725> <t2726>If you marry this girl, you will be miserable.</t2726> <t2727>Of course, you will treat her kindly.</t2727> <t2728>We are always kind to those we care nothing about.</t2728> <t2729>But she will soon discover that you are absolutely indifferent to her.</t2729> <t2730>And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes terribly dowdy, or wears very chic hats that another woman's husband has to pay for.</t2730> <t2731>I am not even speaking of the social mistake, which would probably be disgraceful, and, of course, I would not allow it to happen, but I assure you that in any case, the whole affair will be an absolute failure.”</t2731>
<t2732>“I suppose it really will be like that,” the young man muttered, pacing back and forth in the room, and looking terribly pale.</t2732> <t2733>“But I think it is my duty.</t2733> <t2734>It's not my fault if this terrible tragedy prevents me from doing what is right.</t2734> <t2735>I remember you once said that there is always a bad fate with kind decisions — that they are always made too late.</t2735> <t2736>Mine must be the same.”</t2736>
<t2737>“Kind decisions are futile attempts to obstruct the laws of science.</t2737> <t2738>Their root cause is pure arrogance.</t2738> <t2739>Their result is absolute zero.</t2739> <t2740>They give us, from time to time, a few barren luxurious emotions that still hold a certain appeal to the weak.</t2740> <t2741>That is all that can be said about them.</t2741> <t2742>They are merely checks drawn on a bank where one has no account.</t2742><t2743>”</t2743>
<t2744>"Harry," Dorian Gray exclaimed, approaching and sitting down beside him, "why can't I feel this tragedy as much as I want to?</t2744> <t2745>I don't think I'm heartless.</t2745> <t2746>What do you think?"</t2746>
<t2747>"You have done too many foolish things over the past two weeks to have the right to call yourself that, Dorian," Lord Henry replied, with his sweet, melancholic smile.</t2747>
<t2748>The young man frowned.</t2748> <t2749>“I don't like that explanation, Harry,” he replied, “but I'm glad you don't think I'm heartless.</t2749> <t2750>I'm not that kind of person.</t2750> <t2751>I know I'm not.</t2751> <t2752>However, I must admit that what happened didn't affect me as it should have.</t2752> <t2753>It seemed to me like just a wonderful ending to a wonderful play.</t2753> <t2754>It had all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I played a great role, yet I wasn't hurt by it.”</t2754>
<t2755>“That is an interesting question,” Lord Henry said, finding a refined pleasure in playing with the unconscious selfishness of the young man — “a very interesting question.</t2755> <t2756>I think the correct explanation is this.</t2756> <t2757>It often happens that the real tragedies in life occur in such an anti-artistic manner that they hurt us with their brutal aggression, absolute disjointedness, absurd senselessness, and lack of style.</t2757> <t2758>They affect us just as vulgarity affects us.</t2758> <t2759>They give us an impression of absolute malicious power, and we resist them.</t2759> <t2760>However, sometimes, a tragedy with beautiful artistic elements intersects our lives.</t2760> <t2761>If these beautiful elements are real, then the whole affair easily captivates our sense of dramatic effect.</t2761> <t2762>Suddenly we find that we are no longer actors, but the audience of the play.</t2762> <t2763>Or rather, we are both.</t2763> <t2764>We watch ourselves, and it is the very surprise of this performance that fascinates us.</t2764> <t2765>In the current situation, what has actually happened?</t2765> <t2766>Someone has committed suicide because they loved you.</t2766> <t2767>I wish I could have such an experience sometime.</t2767> <t2768>It would make me love love for the rest of my life.</t2768> <t2769>The people who have been infatuated with me — not many, but there have been some — always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they for me.</t2769> <t2770>They fade away, become dull, and when I meet them again, they immediately drift into memory.</t2770> <t2771>That dreadful memory of women! How terrifying it is!</t2771> <t2772>And how it reveals a state of complete intellectual dullness!</t2772> <t2773>We should absorb the colors of life, but never remember its details.</t2773> <t2774>The details are always vulgar.”</t2774>
<t2775>“I have to plant opium in my own garden,” Dorian sighed.</t2775>
<t2776>“No need,” your friend replied.</t2776><t2777>“Life always has opium in hand.</t2777><t2778>Of course, sometimes many things also drag on.</t2778><t2779>There was a time I wore nothing but purple for an entire season, as a form of artistic mourning for a love that didn’t want to die.</t2779><t2780>However, in the end, it still died.</t2780><t2781>I forgot what killed it.</t2781><t2782>I think it was her proposal to sacrifice the whole world for me.</t2782><t2783>That is always a terrible moment.</t2783><t2784>It makes one terrified of permanence.</t2784><t2785>Oh, by the way — can you believe it? — last week, at Mrs. Hampshire’s place, I found myself sitting next to the lady in question at dinner, and she insisted on starting over, digging up the past, nurturing the future.</t2785><t2786>I had buried my love under a bed of heliotrope.</t2786><t2787>She dug it up again and assured me that I had ruined her life.</t2787><t2788>I had to make it clear that she had eaten a dreadful meal, so I wasn’t worried.</t2788><t2789>But how she displayed such a lack of tact.</t2789><t2790>One charm of the past is that it is the past.</t2790><t2791>But women never realize when the curtain has fallen.</t2791><t2792>They always want a sixth act, and just when interest in the play has completely faded, they propose to continue it.</t2792><t2793>If they were allowed to have their way, every comedy would end in a tragedy, and every tragedy would climax with a farce.</t2793><t2794>They are charmingly artificial, but they lack the capacity to appreciate art.</t2794><t2795>You are much luckier than I am.</t2795><t2796>I assure you, Dorian, that no woman I have ever known could do for me what Sibyl Vane has done for you.</t2796><t2797>Ordinary girls always console themselves.</t2797><t2798>Some of them do so by favoring sentimental colors.</t2798><t2799>Never trust a woman who wears mauve, no matter her age, or one over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons.</t2799><t2800>It always means they are in trouble.</t2800><t2801>Others find great comfort in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands.</t2801><t2802>They flaunt their marital happiness in our faces as if it were the most seductive sin.</t2802><t2803>Religion also comforts some women.</t2803><t2804>Its mysticism has all the allure of an illicit affair, one woman once told me; and I can quite understand that.</t2804><t2805>Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner.</t2805><t2806>Conscience makes us all self-centered.</t2806><t2807>Yes; indeed, there are countless comforts that women have found in modern life.</t2807><t2808>In fact, I haven’t even mentioned the most important one.”</t2808>
<t2809>"What is that, Harry?" the boy said, indifferently.</t2809>
<t2810>“Ah, the obvious consolation.</t2810> <t2811>Snatching away another woman's admirer when she loses her own.</t2811> <t2812>In the upper class, this always vindicates women.</t2812> <t2813>But in reality, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane surely is from every woman we meet! I find something truly beautiful in her death.</t2813> <t2814>I am glad to live in a century where such wonders occur.</t2814> <t2815>They make us believe in the reality of things that we all jest about, like romance, passion, and love.”</t2815>
<t2816>“I was too cruel to her.</t2816> <t2817>Did you forget about that?”</t2817>
<t2818>“I am afraid that women tend to value cruelty, blatant cruelty, more than anything else.</t2818> <t2819>They have marvelous primal instincts.</t2819> <t2820>We have liberated them, but they are still slaves searching for their masters, just the same.</t2820> <t2821>They like to be dominated.</t2821> <t2822>I am sure you are wonderful.</t2822> <t2823>I have never seen you truly and completely angry, but I can imagine how interesting you would look.</t2823> <t2824>And, after all, the other day you told me something that at the time seemed like mere imagination to me, but now I see it as absolutely accurate, and it holds the solution to all problems.”</t2824>
<t2825>“What is it, Harry?”</t2825>
<t2826>"You told me that you saw Sibyl Vane as representing all the romantic heroines — that she was Desdemona one night, Ophelia another; that if she died as Juliet, she would come back to life as Imogen."</t2826>
<t2827>“She will never come back to life again,” the young man muttered, burying his face in his hands.</t2827>
<t2828>“No, she will never come back to life.</t2828> <t2829>She has played her final role.</t2829> <t2830>But you must think of that lonely death in that gaudy, cheap dressing room as just a bizarre, gruesome excerpt from some tragedy of the time of King James I, like a splendid scene of Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.</t2830> <t2831>That girl never truly lived, and therefore she never truly died.</t2831> <t2832>To you, at least, she was always a dream, a phantom flitting through Shakespeare's plays and making them more beautiful by her presence, a reed through which Shakespeare's music sounded richer and more filled with joy.</t2832> <t2833>The moment she touched real life, she spoiled it, and it spoiled her, so she went away.</t2833> <t2834>Weep for Ophelia, if you like.</t2834> <t2835>Put ashes on your head for Cordelia being strangled.</t2835> <t2836>Cry to the heavens for Brabantio's daughter dying.</t2836> <t2837>But do not waste your tears for Sibyl Vane.</t2837> <t2838>She was less real than they are.”</t2838>
<t2839>Be still.</t2839> <t2840>The afternoon darkened in the room.</t2840> <t2841>In the silence, with silver legs, shadows crept in from the garden.</t2841> <t2842>The fading colors gradually disappeared from everything.</t2842>
<t2843>A moment later, Dorian Gray looked up. "You have explained me to myself, Harry," he murmured, with a slight sigh of relief.</t2843> <t2844>"I feel everything you say, but somehow I am afraid, and I cannot express it to myself.</t2844> <t2845>How do you understand me so well!</t2845> <t2846>But we shall not speak again of what has happened.</t2846> <t2847>It is a wonderful memory.</t2847> <t2848>That's all.</t2848> <t2849>I wonder if life has anything as wonderful left for me."</t2849>
<t2850>"Life still has everything ready for you, Dorian.</t2850> <t2851>There is nothing that you, with your exceptional beauty, cannot do.</t2851><t2852>"</t2852>
<t2853>“But suppose, Harry, I become haggard, old, wrinkled?</t2853> <t2854>Then what?”</t2854>
<t2855>“Ah, at that time,” Lord Henry said, getting up as if to leave — “at that time, my dear Dorian, you will have to fight to win.</t2855> <t2856>As it is now, they are being brought to you.</t2856> <t2857>No, you must keep your beauty.</t2857> <t2858>We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and thinks too much to be beautiful.</t2858> <t2859>We need you very much.</t2859> <t2860>And now you should change your clothes, then run down to the club.</t2860> <t2861>We are quite late already.”</t2861>
<t2862>“I think I will meet you at the opera house, Harry. I feel so tired, I can't eat anything.</t2862> <t2863>What is your sister's box number?”</t2863>
<t2864>“Twenty-seven, I suppose. It's on the upper floor.</t2864> <t2865>You will see my brother's name on the door.</t2865> <t2866>But I am very sorry that you didn't come for dinner.”</t2866>
<t2867>"I don't feel up to it," Dorian said, indifferently. "But I am very grateful to you for everything you have said to me.</t2867> <t2868>You are certainly my best friend.</t2868> <t2869>No one has ever understood me like you do."</t2869>
<t2870>“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” Lord Henry replied, shaking his hand. “Goodbye.</t2870> <t2871>I will see you before half-past nine, I hope. Remember, Patti will sing.”</t2871>
<t2872>When he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray rang the bell, and a few minutes later Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the curtains.</t2872> <t2873>He anxiously waited for him to leave.</t2873> <t2874>This servant seemed to take an eternity to do anything.</t2874>
<t2875>As soon as he was out, he rushed to the shield and pulled it back.</t2875> <t2876>No; there was no further change in the painting.</t2876> <t2877>It received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before he himself knew about it.</t2877> <t2878>It knew about the events in life the moment they happened.</t2878> <t2879>The cruel wickedness that marred the beauty of the mouth must have appeared at the very moment the girl drank the poison, no matter what.</t2879> <t2880>Or was it indifferent to the outcome?</t2880> <t2881>Could it only perceive what happened in the soul?</t2881> <t2882>He wondered, and both hoped that someday he would see the change happen before his very eyes, and shuddered at the thought.</t2882>
<t2883>Poor Sibyl!</t2883> <t2884>How romantic everything had been! She used to mimic death on stage.</t2884> <t2885>Then Death itself touched her, and took her away with it.</t2885> <t2886>How did she perform that final dreadful scene? Did she curse you when she died?</t2886> <t2887>No; she died because she loved you, and love will always be a curse for you now.</t2887> <t2888>She atoned for everything, with the sacrifice she made of her life.</t2888> <t2889>You will no longer think about what she made you go through, about that terrible night at the theater.</t2889> <t2890>When you think of her, it will be as if a tragic and wonderful image has been sent to the stage of this world to show the ultimate truth about Love.</t2890> <t2891>A tragic and wonderful image?</t2891> <t2892>Tears welled up in your eyes as you remembered her childlike face, her strange enchanting personality, and her hesitant shyness.</t2892> <t2893>You quickly brushed them away, and looked back at the painting.</t2893>
<t2894>You feel that it is truly time to make a choice.</t2894> <t2895>Or have you already chosen?</t2895> <t2896>Yes, life has decided that for you — life, and your own endless curiosity about it.</t2896> <t2897>Eternal youth, endless passion, refined and secret pleasures, wild joys and even wilder sins — you will have all these.</t2897> <t2898>The portrait will bear the burden of your shame: that is all.</t2898>
<t2899>A tingling pain spread throughout his body as he thought about the desecration that awaited the beautiful face on the canvas.</t2899> <t2900>Once, to childishly mimic Narcissus, he had kissed, or pretended to kiss, the painted lips that were now smiling so cruelly at him.</t2900> <t2901>Morning after morning, he had sat before the portrait, marveling at its beauty, almost infatuated with it, sometimes it seemed to him.</t2901> <t2902>Would it now change with every mood he endured?</t2902> <t2903>Would it become something hideous and disgusting, hidden away in a locked room, shielded from the sunlight that used to cast a golden hue on its wondrous wavy hair?</t2903> <t2904>Poor thing! Poor thing!</t2904>
<t2905>He thought for a moment about pleading for the terrible empathy existing between him and the painting to end.</t2905> <t2906>It had changed in response to one plea; perhaps in response to another plea, it could remain unchanged.</t2906> <t2907>However, would someone who knew something about Life give up the chance to stay young forever, no matter how strange that chance might be, or how full of predetermined consequences it might be?</t2907> <t2908>Besides, was it really within his control?</t2908> <t2909>Could it be that the plea had indeed brought about the transformation?</t2909> <t2910>Could there be some strange scientific rationale for all of this? If thought could influence a living body, could thought also influence inanimate, lifeless things?</t2910> <t2911>Moreover, without conscious thought or desire, could things outside of us resonate in harmony with our moods and passions, could atoms call to atoms with the secret love of strange affinities?</t2911> <t2912>But reasoning no longer mattered.</t2912> <t2913>He would never again incite any terrible force with a plea.</t2913> <t2914>If the painting changed, then let it change.</t2914> <t2915>That was all.</t2915> <t2916>Why investigate it too closely?</t2916>
<t2917>There is indeed a certain pleasure in watching it.</t2917> <t2918>You will be able to follow your mind into its secret places.</t2918> <t2919>This portrait will become the most magical mirror for you.</t2919> <t2920>As it has revealed your body to you, it will reveal your soul to you.</t2920> <t2921>And when winter descends upon it, you will still stand in the trembling spring on the verge of summer.</t2921> <t2922>When the blood slips away from its face, leaving behind a pale mask with leaden eyes, you will still retain the enchanting beauty of youth.</t2922> <t2923>Not a single flower in your beauty will ever wither.</t2923> <t2924>Not a single heartbeat of your life will ever weaken.</t2924> <t2925>Like the Greek gods, you will be strong, agile, and joyful.</t2925> <t2926>What does it matter what happens to the many-colored image on the canvas?</t2926> <t2927>You will be safe.</t2927> <t2928>That is the most important thing.</t2928>
<t2929>He pulled the cover back over the painting, smiling as he did so, and went into the bedroom, where the servant was waiting for him.</t2929> <t2930>An hour later, he was at the opera house, and Lord Henry was leaning over his seat.</t2930>
<t2931>Chapter 9</t2931>
<t2932>The next morning, while he was having breakfast, Basil Hallward appeared in the room.</t2932>
<t2933>“I am very glad to have found you, Dorian,” he said, solemnly.</t2933> <t2934>“I called last night, and they told me you were at the opera house.</t2934> <t2935>Of course, I knew that couldn't be true.</t2935> <t2936>But I wish you had left a message about where you actually went.</t2936> <t2937>I had a terrible evening, somewhat fearing that this tragedy might follow another tragedy.</t2937> <t2938>I think you could have telegraphed me as soon as you heard the news.</t2938> <t2939>I read it entirely by chance in the late edition of The Globe, which I picked up at the club.</t2939> <t2940>I came here immediately and was distressed not to find you.</t2940> <t2941>I can't tell you how heartbroken I was over the whole affair.</t2941> <t2942>I understand what you must be going through.</t2942> <t2943>But where were you? Did you go down to see the girl's mother?</t2943> <t2944>For a moment, I thought about following you there.</t2944> <t2945>They gave the address in the paper.</t2945> <t2946>Somewhere on Euston Road, right?</t2946> <t2947>But I was afraid of intruding on a grief that I could not alleviate.</t2947> <t2948>Poor woman!</t2948> <t2949>She must be in such a terrible state! And her only child too! What did she say about all this?”</t2949>
<t2950>“My dear Basil, how would I know?” Dorian Gray muttered, sipping some pale gold wine from a delicate Venetian glass with golden bubbles, and looking very sad.</t2950> <t2951>“I was at the opera house.</t2951> <t2952>You should have been there.</t2952> <t2953>I met Harry's sister, Gwendolen, for the first time.</t2953> <t2954>We were in her box.</t2954> <t2955>She is extremely charming; and Patti sang wonderfully.</t2955> <t2956>Don't talk about dreadful subjects anymore.</t2956> <t2957>If we don't talk about something, it will never happen.</t2957> <t2958>Only words, as Harry says, bring reality to things.</t2958> <t2959>I can tell you that she is not the only child of that woman.</t2959> <t2960>There is a son, a charming fellow, I suppose.</t2960> <t2961>But he is not an actor.</t2961> <t2962>He is a sailor, I believe.</t2962> <t2963>And now tell me about yourself and what you are painting.”</t2963>
<t2964>“You went to the opera house?” Hallward said, pronouncing very slowly, with a bit of painful tension in his voice.</t2964> <t2965>“You went to the opera house while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some filthy lodging?</t2965> <t2966>You can talk to me about other girls flaunting their charms, about Patti singing wonderfully, even before the girl you loved had the peace of a grave to sleep in?</t2966> <t2967>Why, my friend, there are horrors awaiting that small, pale corpse of hers!”</t2967>
<t2968>"Enough, Basil! I can't bear it any longer!" Dorian shouted, standing up abruptly.</t2968> <t2969>"You shouldn't talk to me about these things anymore.</t2969> <t2970>What's done is done.</t2970> <t2971>What's past is past."</t2971>
<t2972>1 One point of contention in the author's very hard-to-read handwritten manuscript is that many English prints suggest this word is “hear.”</t2972> <t2973>However, the translator chose the translation as “bear.”</t2973>
<t2974>“You call yesterday the past?”</t2974>
<t2975>“What does actual time have to do with it? Only shallow people need years to get over an emotion.</t2975> <t2976>Someone who is the master of themselves can end their pain as easily as they can create a pleasure.</t2976> <t2977>I do not want to let emotions decide my fate.</t2977> <t2978>I want to use them, to enjoy them, to control them.”</t2978>
<t2979>“Dorian, this is terrible!</t2979> <t2980>Something has completely changed you.</t2980> <t2981>You still look like that same boy, a wonderful boy, who day after day, came down to my studio to sit as a model for the painting of yourself.</t2981> <t2982>But back then you were simple, natural, affectionate.</t2982> <t2983>You used to be the purest creature in the whole world.</t2983> <t2984>Now I don't know what has influenced you.</t2984> <t2985>You speak as if you have no heart, no compassion within you.</t2985> <t2986>It's all due to Harry's influence. That's what I think.”</t2986>
<t2987>The young man blushed, and, approaching the window, looked outside for a few minutes at the green lawn and the garden shimmering in the sunlight.</t2987>
<t2988>“I owe Harry a lot, Basil,” he finally said, — “more than I owe you.</t2988> <t2989>You only taught me to be arrogant.”</t2989>
<t2990>"That's it, I have been punished for that, Dorian — or someday will be."</t2990>
<t2991>"I don't understand what you mean, Basil," he exclaimed, turning around.</t2991> <t2992>"I don't understand what you want.</t2992> <t2993>What do you want?"</t2993>
<t2994>"I want the Dorian Gray that I once painted," the artist said sadly.</t2994>
<t2995>"Basil," the young man said, approaching him, placing his hand on his shoulder. "You have come too late.</t2995> <t2996>Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl Vane had committed suicide..."</t2996>
<t2997>“Suicide! Oh my God!</t2997> <t2998>Are you sure about that?” Hallward cried out, looking up at him with a fearful expression.</t2998>
<t2999>“My dear Basil! Surely you don't think it was a mere accident? Of course, she committed suicide.</t2999><t3000>”</t3000>
<t3001>The older person buried their face in their hands. "It's really scary," they muttered, and a shiver ran through their body.</t3001>
<t3002>“No,” Dorian Gray said, “There is nothing to be afraid of here.</t3002><t3003>It is one of the greatest romantic tragedies of the age.</t3003><t3004>As a rule, actors live the most mundane lives.</t3004><t3005>They are good husbands, dutiful wives, or something equally dull.</t3005><t3006>You understand what I mean — the virtues of the middle class, and all that sort of thing.</t3006><t3007>How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy.</t3007><t3008>She was always the heroine.</t3008><t3009>The last night she acted — the night you saw her — she performed poorly because she had known real love.</t3009><t3010>When she realized the unreality of it, she died, as Juliet might have died.</t3010><t3011>She passed into the sphere of art once more.</t3011><t3012>There was something of the martyr about her.</t3012><t3013>Her death had all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty.</t3013><t3014>But, as I said, you must not think I am heartless.</t3014><t3015>If you had come here yesterday at a particular moment — around half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six — you would have found me weeping.</t3015><t3016>Even Harry, who was here at the time, who brought me the news, could not really understand what I went through.</t3016><t3017>I suffered immensely.</t3017><t3018>Then it passed away.</t3018><t3019>I cannot repeat an emotion.</t3019><t3020>No one can, except sentimentalists.</t3020><t3021>And you are very unfair, Basil. You come down here to console me.</t3021><t3022>That is your charm. You find me consoled, and you are furious.</t3022><t3023>How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a charitable man who spent twenty years of his life trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered — I forget exactly what it was.</t3023><t3024>In the end, he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment.</t3024><t3025>He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope.</t3025><t3026>Besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me to forget what has happened, or to see it from the proper artistic point of view.</t3026><t3027>Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts?</t3027><t3028>I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio the other day and chancing upon that delightful phrase.</t3028><t3029>Indeed, I am not the same person who told you that satin could console one for all the miseries of life when we were down at Marlow together.</t3029><t3030>I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle.</t3030><t3031>Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp — there is much to be got from all these.</t3031><t3032>But the artistic temperament they create, or at any rate reveal, is more to me than all these.</t3032><t3033>To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life.</t3033><t3034>I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this.</t3034><t3035>You have not realized how I have developed.</t3035><t3036>I was a schoolboy when you knew me.</t3036><t3037>Now I am a man.</t3037><t3038>I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas.</t3038><t3039>I am different, but you must not love me less.</t3039><t3040>I have changed, but you must always be my friend.</t3040><t3041>Of course I am very fond of Harry.</t3041><t3042>But I know you are better than he is.</t3042><t3043>You are not strong — you are too afraid of life — but you are better.</t3043><t3044>And how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me.</t3044><t3045>I am what I am.</t3045><t3046>There is nothing more to be said.”</t3046>
<t3047>1 A source of comfort in art.</t3047>
<t3048>The artist felt strangely moved.</t3048> <t3049>The young man had been incredibly sincere with him, and his personality had been a great turning point in his art.</t3049> <t3050>He could no longer harbor the intention to scold him.</t3050> <t3051>After all, the young man's indifference was probably just a mood that would eventually pass.</t3051> <t3052>There were too many good things, too many noble qualities in him.</t3052>
<t3053>“Alright, Dorian,” he said at last, with a sad smile, “I will not speak to you again about this dreadful matter after today.</t3053> <t3054>I just hope that your name will not be mentioned in connection with it.</t3054> <t3055>The investigation will take place this afternoon.</t3055> <t3056>Have they summoned you yet?”</t3056>
<t3057>Dorian shook his head, and a look of discomfort crossed his face at the mention of the word "investigation."</t3057> <t3058>There was something crude and vulgar about everything of that sort.</t3058> <t3059>"They don't know my name," he replied.</t3059>
<t3060>“But surely she knows, right?”</t3060>
<t3061>“Only my Christian name, and that I am sure she never mentioned to anyone.</t3061> <t3062>She once told me that they were all quite curious to know who I was, and that she always told them my name was Prince Charming.</t3062> <t3063>That was her sweetness.</t3063> <t3064>You must paint me a picture of Sibyl, Basil.</t3064> <t3065>I want something of her more than the memory of a few kisses and some broken, pathetic words.”</t3065>
<t3066>"I will try to do something, Dorian, if it makes you happy.</t3066> <t3067>But you must come and sit for me again.</t3067> <t3068>I can't continue without you."</t3068>
<t3069>"I can never sit for you again, Basil. It's impossible!" he cried, drawing back.</t3069>
<t3070>The artist stared at him intently.</t3070> <t3071>“My dear boy, how absurd!” he exclaimed. “Are you saying you don't like what I have done for you?</t3071> <t3072>Where is it?</t3072> <t3073>Why did you pull the screen in front of it?</t3073> <t3074>Let me see it.</t3074> <t3075>It is the best thing I have ever done.</t3075> <t3076>Take the screen away, Dorian.</t3076> <t3077>Your servant is shameful for covering my work like that.</t3077> <t3078>I felt that this room seemed different from the moment I entered.”</t3078>
<t3079>“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil.</t3079> <t3080>You don't think I let him arrange my room for me, do you? He occasionally leaves flowers for me — that's all.</t3080> <t3081>No; I did it myself.</t3081> <t3082>The light is too strong for the portrait.</t3082><t3083>”</t3083>
<t3084>“Too strong?</t3084> <t3085>Definitely not, my friend! This is a wonderful place for it.</t3085> <t3086>Let me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.</t3086>
<t3087>A terrified scream escaped from Dorian Gray's lips, and he rushed between the painter and the shield.</t3087>
<t3088>“Basil,” he said, looking pale, “you shouldn't have looked at it.</t3088> <t3089>I didn't want you to do that.”</t3089>
<t3090>"Don't look at my work! You're not serious.</t3090> <t3091>Why can't I look at it?" Hallward exclaimed, laughing.</t3091>
<t3092>"If you try to look at it, Basil, I swear on my honor that I will never speak to you again as long as I live.</t3092> <t3093>I am completely serious.</t3093> <t3094>I offer no excuses, and don't ask for any.</t3094> <t3095>But remember, if you touch this shield, everything between us is over."</t3095>
<t3096>Hallward was struck as if by lightning.</t3096> <t3097>He looked at Dorian Gray, completely astonished.</t3097> <t3098>He had never seen him like this.</t3098> <t3099>The young man was truly pale with anger.</t3099> <t3100>His hands were clenched, and his pupils were like discs of blue fire.</t3100> <t3101>He was trembling all over.</t3101>
<t3102>"Dorian!"</t3102>
<t3103>"Don't speak!"</t3103>
<t3104>“But what is the problem?”</t3104> <t3105>“Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to,” he said, quite coldly, turning on his heel and walking towards the window.</t3105> <t3106>“But, really, it seems quite unreasonable that I can't see my own work, especially when I'm about to exhibit it in Paris this fall.</t3106> <t3107>I'm certainly going to have to give it another coat of varnish before then, so I have to see it one day, and why not today?”</t3107>
<t3108>“Exhibit it?</t3108> <t3109>You want to exhibit it?” Dorian Gray exclaimed, a strange feeling of dread tingling throughout his body.</t3109> <t3110>Is the whole world about to see his secret?</t3110> <t3111>Is everyone about to gape at the mystery of his life?</t3111> <t3112>Impossible.</t3112> <t3113>Something — he didn't know what — had to be done immediately.</t3113>
<t3114>"Yes; I don't think you will object to that."</t3114> <t3115>"George Petit is about to gather all my finest paintings for a special exhibition at Rue de Sèze, which will open in the first week of October. The portrait will only have to be away for a month."</t3115> <t3116>"I suppose you can easily part with it during that time."</t3116> <t3117>"In fact, you will certainly be out of town."</t3117> <t3118>"And if you always keep it behind a screen, you can't be too concerned about it."</t3118>
<t3119>Dorian Gray ran his hand across his forehead.</t3119> <t3120>There were beads of sweat there.</t3120> <t3121>He felt that he was on the brink of some terrible danger.</t3121> <t3122>“You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he cried out. “Why have you changed your mind?</t3122> <t3123>You are one of those people who try to be consistent but have as many moods as others.</t3123> <t3124>The only difference is that your moods are quite meaningless.</t3124> <t3125>You cannot forget that you solemnly assured me that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition.</t3125> <t3126>You also told Harry the same thing.” He stopped abruptly and a flash of light appeared in his eyes.</t3126> <t3127>He remembered that Lord Henry had once told him, half in earnest, half in jest, “if you want to have fifteen strange minutes, ask Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture.</t3127> <t3128>He told me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Well, perhaps Basil had his own secret.</t3128> <t3129>He would ask him and see what happened.</t3129>
<t3130>"Basil," he said, coming very close and looking straight into his face, "each of us has a secret.</t3130> <t3131>Tell me yours and I will tell you mine.</t3131> <t3132>What is the reason you refuse to exhibit my painting?"</t3132>
<t3133>The artist trembled, unable to control himself.</t3133> <t3134>"Dorian, if I tell you, you might like me less than you do now, and surely you will laugh at me.</t3134> <t3135>I cannot bear you doing either of these things.</t3135> <t3136>If you want me to never look at your painting again, I am willing.</t3136> <t3137>I always have you to look at.</t3137> <t3138>If you want the most beautiful work I have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am willing.</t3138> <t3139>Your friendship is more precious to me than any fame or reputation."</t3139>
<t3140>"No, Basil, you must tell me," Dorian Gray insisted.</t3140> <t3141>"I think I have the right to know." His sense of dread had vanished, and curiosity took its place.</t3141> <t3142>He was determined to uncover Basil Hallward's secret.</t3142>
<t3143>“Let's sit down, Dorian,” the artist said, looking worried.</t3143> <t3144>“Let's sit down.</t3144> <t3145>And just answer me one question.</t3145> <t3146>Do you notice anything strange about the painting? — something that perhaps didn't strike you at first, but suddenly revealed itself to you?”</t3146>
<t3147>"Basil!" the young man cried out, clutching the arm of the chair with a trembling hand, and staring at him with wild, startled eyes.</t3147>
<t3148>"I realize that you have already seen it.</t3148> <t3149>Don't speak.</t3149> <t3150>Wait until you have heard what I have to say.</t3150> <t3151>Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality has had an extraordinarily special influence on me.</t3151> <t3152>I was dominated by you, soul, intellect, and power.</t3152> <t3153>To me, you became the tangible embodiment of the ideal type that the memory of them still haunts us artists like a wonderful dream.</t3153> <t3154>I worship you.</t3154> <t3155>I gradually became jealous of anyone you talked to.</t3155> <t3156>I wanted to have you entirely for myself.</t3156> <t3157>I was only happy when I was with you.</t3157> <t3158>But when you were away from me, you were still present in my art... Of course, I never let you know about this.</t3158> <t3159>Perhaps it was impossible.</t3159> <t3160>Perhaps you would not understand.</t3160> <t3161>I myself hardly understood.</t3161> <t3162>I only knew that I had come face to face with absolute beauty, and that the world became wondrous before my eyes — too wondrous, perhaps, for in these mad adorations there is danger, the danger of losing them, no less than the danger of keeping them... Week after week went by, and I was drawn more and more to you.</t3162> <t3163>Then came a new development.</t3163> <t3164>I painted you as Paris in beautiful armor, as Adonis with a hunter's cloak and a gleaming boar spear.</t3164> <t3165>Wearing a heavy lotus crown, you sat on the prow of Adrian's flagship, gazing across the muddy blue Nile.</t3165> <t3166>You bent over a still pond in some Greek forest, and saw in the quiet silver of the water your own wondrous face.</t3166> <t3167>And it was everything that art should become, unconscious, ideal, distant.</t3167> <t3168>One day, a day that I sometimes think was disastrous, I decided to paint a magnificent portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own clothes and in your own time.</t3168> <t3169>Whether it was Realism in the painting style, or just the surprise of your personality appearing so directly before me, without any mist or veil, I cannot tell.</t3169> <t3170>But I knew that as I worked on it, it seemed as if every stroke and patch of color revealed my secret.</t3170> <t3171>I gradually became afraid that others might know about my idol worship.</t3171> <t3172>I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it.</t3172> <t3173>That was when I decided never to allow the painting to be exhibited.</t3173> <t3174>You were slightly annoyed; but at that time you did not realize what all this meant to me.</t3174> <t3175>Harry, with whom I discussed it, laughed at me.</t3175> <t3176>But I did not mind.</t3176> <t3177>When the painting was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right... Then, a few days after it left my studio, and just after I escaped the unbearable enchantment of its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish to imagine that I had ever seen anything in it more than the fact that you are extraordinarily handsome, and I could paint that.</t3177> <t3178>Even now I cannot help feeling that it was a mistake to think that the passion we feel in creation ever really shows itself in the work we create.</t3178> <t3179>Art is always more abstract than we imagine.</t3179> <t3180>Form and color tell us about form and color — that is all.</t3180> <t3181>I often think that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals them.</t3181> <t3182>And so when I received this invitation from Paris, I decided to make your portrait the principal work in my exhibition.</t3182> <t3183>Never did it occur to me that you would refuse.</t3183> <t3184>Now I see that you were right.</t3184> <t3185>The painting should not be displayed.</t3185> <t3186>You should not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you.</t3186> <t3187>As I once told Harry, you were made to be worshipped."</t3187>
<t3188>Dorian Gray took a deep breath.</t3188> <t3189>Color returned to his cheeks, and a playful smile appeared on his lips.</t3189> <t3190>The danger had passed.</t3190> <t3191>He was safe now.</t3191> <t3192>However, he couldn't help but feel an infinite pity for the artist who had just made this strange confession to him, and wondered if he himself would ever be dominated by the personality of a friend like that.</t3192> <t3193>Lord Henry had a charm that was extremely dangerous.</t3193> <t3194>But that was all.</t3194> <t3195>He was too wise and too mocking to love sincerely.</t3195> <t3196>Would there ever be someone who made him feel a strange idol worship?</t3196> <t3197>Was life destined to give him such a person?</t3197>
<t3198>“I find it extraordinary,” Hallward said, “that you can see this in the portrait.</t3198> <t3199>Do you really see it?”</t3199>
<t3200>“I see something on it,” he replied, “something that seems very strange to me.”</t3200>
<t3201>“Really? Do you mind if I watch it now?”</t3201>
<t3202>Dorian shook his head. "You shouldn't ask me that, Basil.</t3202> <t3203>I can't let you stand in front of that painting."</t3203>
<t3204>“You will give it, someday, won't you?”</t3204>
<t3205>"Never."</t3205>
<t3206>“Well, that's fine, maybe you are right.</t3206> <t3207>Now, goodbye, Dorian.</t3207> <t3208>You are the only person in my life who has truly influenced my art.</t3208> <t3209>Whatever I do that is good, I owe it to you.</t3209> <t3210>Ah! You have no idea the price I had to pay to be able to tell you everything I just told you.”</t3210>
<t3211>“My dear Basil,” Dorian said, “what did you say to me? You just feel that you admire me a lot.</t3211> <t3212>That is not even a compliment.”</t3212>
<t3213>“It was not meant as a compliment.</t3213> <t3214>It was a confession.</t3214> <t3215>Now, because I have expressed it, something seems to have left me.</t3215> <t3216>Perhaps one should never put their adoration into words.</t3216><t3217>”</t3217>
<t3218>“That is a very disappointing confession.</t3218><t3219>”</t3219>
<t3220>“What do you mean, what are you expecting, Dorian? You don't see anything different in the painting, do you?</t3220> <t3221>Is there nothing else to see?”</t3221>
<t3222>“No; there is nothing else to see.</t3222> <t3223>Why do you ask that?</t3223> <t3224>But don't talk about worship.</t3224> <t3225>It is really silly.</t3225> <t3226>You and I are friends, Basil, and we should remain so forever.</t3226><t3227>”</t3227>
<t3228>"You have Harry," the artist said, sadly.</t3228>
<t3229>"Oh, Harry!" the young man exclaimed, with a murmuring laugh.</t3229> <t3230>"Harry spends many days talking about trivial matters, and many nights doing pointless things.</t3230> <t3231>It's truly a way of life that I would like to experience.</t3231> <t3232>But I still don't think I could turn to Harry if I were in trouble.</t3232> <t3233>I'd rather turn to you, Basil."</t3233>
<t3234>"Will you sit and model for me again?"</t3234>
<t3235>"Impossible!"</t3235>
<t3236>"You have spoiled my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian.</t3236> <t3237>No one ever meets two ideal people.</t3237> <t3238>Only a few ever meet one."</t3238>
<t3239>“I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I can never sit for you again.</t3239> <t3240>There is something fatal about a portrait.</t3240> <t3241>It has its own life.</t3241> <t3242>I will come and have tea with you. That will be enough fun.”</t3242>
<t3243>“Happier for you, I fear so,” Hallward muttered, regretfully.</t3243> <t3244>“Now, goodbye.</t3244> <t3245>I am very sorry that you won't let me see the painting one more time.</t3245> <t3246>But what can be done.</t3246> <t3247>I understand how you feel about it.”</t3247>
<t3248>When he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.</t3248> <t3249>Poor Basil! How little he knew about the real reason!</t3249> <t3250>And it was very strange that, instead of being forced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in extracting a secret from his friend! That strange confession had explained so many things to him! The painter's irrational jealousies, his fervent devotion, his excessive praises, his strange silence — now he understood them all, and he felt a bit of pity.</t3250> <t3251>It seemed to him that there was something tragic about a friendship colored by such romance.</t3251>
<t3252>He sighed and rang the bell.</t3252> <t3253>The portrait had to be hidden at all costs.</t3253> <t3254>He couldn't risk being discovered again.</t3254> <t3255>He must have been out of his mind to allow this thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room where any of his friends could enter.</t3255>
<t3256>Chapter 10</t3256>
<t3257>When his servant came in, he looked at him intently, wondering if he had thought about peeking behind the screen.</t3257> <t3258>The servant was quite calm, waiting for his orders.</t3258> <t3259>Dorian lit a cigarette, walked over to the mirror, and glanced into it.</t3259> <t3260>He could clearly see Victor's reflection.</t3260> <t3261>It was like the calm mask of a knowing slave.</t3261> <t3262>There was nothing to fear here.</t3262> <t3263>However, he thought it was better to remain cautious.</t3263>
<t3264>Speaking very slowly, he told him to inform the housekeeper that he wanted to meet her, then go to the frame maker and ask him to send two of his workers immediately.</t3264> <t3265>It seemed to him that when the servant left the room, his eyes glanced towards the screen.</t3265> <t3266>Or was that just his imagination?</t3266>
<t3267>A moment later, wearing a black silk dress and a pair of outdated fingerless gloves on her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf hurried into the library.</t3267> <t3268>You asked her for the classroom key.</t3268>
<t3269>“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it's full of dust.</t3269> <t3270>I must tidy it up and arrange it neatly before you go in.</t3270> <t3271>It's not suitable for you to see it now.</t3271> <t3272>Really, it isn't.”</t3272>
<t3273>“I don't need it to be tidied up, Leaf.</t3273> <t3274>I just need the key.</t3274><t3275>”</t3275>
<t3276>“Yes, sir, but you will be covered in cobwebs if you go in there.</t3276> <t3277>Why is that? It hasn't been opened for nearly five years, since the old man passed away.</t3277><t3278>”</t3278>
<t3279>He recoiled at the mention of his grandfather.</t3279> <t3280>He had bitter memories of him. "It's okay," he replied.</t3280> <t3281>"I just want to see that place — that's all.</t3281> <t3282>Give me the key.</t3282><t3283>"</t3283>
<t3284>"Here is the key, sir," the old woman said, rummaging through the bunch of keys with her two trembling, doubtful hands.</t3284> <t3285>"Here is the key.</t3285> <t3286>I will take it off the bunch right away.</t3286> <t3287>But you are not thinking of living up there, are you, sir, when you are so comfortable here?"</t3287>
<t3288>“No, no,” he shouted, impatiently. “Thank you, Leaf.</t3288> <t3289>That's enough.”</t3289>
<t3290>She lingered for a moment, rambling about some minor details in the house.</t3290> <t3291>He sighed, telling her to handle everything as she thought was best.</t3291> <t3292>She left the room, smiling brightly.</t3292>
<t3293>When the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked around the room.</t3293> <t3294>His eyes noticed a large satin bedspread, richly embroidered in gold, a splendid work from late seventeenth-century Venice that his grandfather had found in a nunnery near Bologna.</t3294> <t3295>Yes, it would be used to wrap that horrible thing.</t3295> <t3296>It might have once been frequently used as a shroud for the dead.</t3296> <t3297>Now it concealed something with its own decay, worse than the decay of death itself — something that would produce fears but never die.</t3297> <t3298>What worms do to a corpse, so would his sins do to the image painted on the canvas.</t3298> <t3299>They would mar its beauty, consume its grace.</t3299> <t3300>They would defile it, make it shameful.</t3300> <t3301>Yet it would continue to live.</t3301> <t3302>It would live on forever.</t3302>
<t3303>He shuddered and, for a moment, regretted not telling Basil the real reason why he wanted to hide the painting.</t3303> <t3304>Basil would help him resist the influence of Lord Henry, and the even more harmful influences stemming from his own temperament.</t3304> <t3305>The love that he cherished for him — because it was true love — had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual.</t3305> <t3306>It was not merely the natural admiration for beauty, an admiration that is born from the senses and also dies when the senses grow weary.</t3306> <t3307>It was the kind of love that Michael Angelo, Montaigne, Winckelmann, and even Shakespeare had known.</t3307> <t3308>Yes, Basil could have saved him.</t3308> <t3309>But now it was too late.</t3309> <t3310>The past can always be destroyed.</t3310> <t3311>Regret, denial, or forgetfulness can do that.</t3311> <t3312>But the future is inevitable.</t3312> <t3313>The passions within him would find their terrible outlet, the dreams would turn their shadow of guilt into reality.</t3313>
<t3314>He picked up the large purple-and-gold cloth from the divan that was covering it, and, holding the cloth in both hands, walked behind the screen.</t3314> <t3315>Had the face on the canvas become more vile than before?</t3315> <t3316>It seemed to him that it had not changed; however, his hatred for it had increased.</t3316> <t3317>Blonde hair, blue eyes, rosy-red lips — they were all still there.</t3317> <t3318>Only the expression had changed.</t3318> <t3319>There was something terrible in its cruelty.</t3319> <t3320>Compared to what he saw in it of criticism or reproach, how superficial — how shallow and absurd — Basil's rebukes about Sibyl Vane seemed!</t3320> <t3321>His soul was looking at him from the canvas and demanding that he be judged.</t3321> <t3322>A look of pain appeared on his face, and he flung the magnificent funeral cloth over the painting.</t3322> <t3323>As he did so, a knock sounded at the door.</t3323> <t3324>He stepped out as the servant entered.</t3324>
<t3325>“They have arrived, sir.</t3325><t3326>”</t3326>
<t3327>You felt that this servant had to be dismissed immediately.</t3327> <t3328>You must not let him know where the painting is about to be taken.</t3328> <t3329>There was something cunning about him, and he had deep, deceitful eyes.</t3329> <t3330>Sitting down at the writing desk, you hastily wrote a short letter to Lord Henry, asking him to send you something to read, and reminding him that they would meet at eight fifteen tonight.</t3330>
<t3331>“Wait for a response,” he said, handing it to him, “and bring them in here.”</t3331>
<t3332>After two or three minutes, there was another knock, and it was Mr. Hubbard, the renowned frame-maker from South Audley Street, who entered with a slightly clumsy young assistant.</t3332> <t3333>Mr. Hubbard was a small, rosy man with long red sideburns, whose admiration for art had been significantly restrained by the chronic poverty of most of the artists he dealt with.</t3333> <t3334>As a rule, he never left his shop.</t3334> <t3335>He waited for people to come to him.</t3335> <t3336>But he always made an exception to show his affection for Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that charmed everyone.</t3336> <t3337>Even just seeing him made them happy.</t3337>
<t3338>“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his freckled, chubby hands together.</t3338> <t3339>“I thought I would give myself the honor of coming here in person.</t3339> <t3340>I have just acquired a very beautiful frame, sir.</t3340> <t3341>I picked it up at an auction.</t3341> <t3342>Antique Florence. From Fonthill, I believe.</t3342> <t3343>Admirably suitable for a religious subject, Mr. Gray.”</t3343>
<t3344>“I am very sorry that you had to come here in person, Mr. Hubbard.</t3344> <t3345>I will definitely drop by to see the frame — although currently, I am not very fond of religious art — but today I just need you to help me bring a painting up to the rooftop of the house.</t3345> <t3346>It is quite heavy, so I think I will need to borrow a few of your workers.”</t3346>
<t3347>"It's no trouble at all, Mr. Gray.</t3347> <t3348>I'm very happy to serve you in any way.</t3348> <t3349>Which artwork is it, sir?"</t3349>
<t3350>“This one,” Dorian replied, shifting the shield.</t3350> <t3351>“Can you move it while still covering everything like this?</t3351> <t3352>I don't want it to get scratched when we take it upstairs.”</t3352>
<t3353>"There will be nothing difficult at all, sir," the cheerful framer said and began, with the help of his assistant, to remove the painting from the long brass chains that hung it. "And now, where will we have to carry it, Mr. Gray?"</t3353>
<t3354>“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you would kindly follow me.</t3354> <t3355>Or perhaps it would be better if you went ahead.</t3355> <t3356>I am afraid it is right at the top of the house.</t3356> <t3357>We will go up by the front stairs, as they are wider.”</t3357>
<t3358>You held the door open for them, and they went through to the hall and then began to climb up.</t3358> <t3359>The elaborate nature of the frame made the painting extremely cumbersome, and occasionally, despite the humble protests of Mr. Hubbard, a man with the characteristic trait of all true merchants of disliking to see a nobleman do anything useful, Dorian would place his hand on it as if to help them.</t3359>
<t3360>"It's relatively heavy to carry, sir," the small man panted as they reached the top of the stairs.</t3360> <t3361>And he wiped his shiny forehead.</t3361>
<t3362>“I’m afraid it’s quite heavy,” Dorian muttered, as he turned the key to the door that would keep the strange secret of his life and hide his soul from the eyes of the world.</t3362>
<t3363>You hadn't entered this place for more than four years — indeed, not since you first used it as a playroom when you were a child, and later as a study room when you were a bit older.</t3363> <t3364>It was a spacious, well-proportioned room, specially built by the last Lord Kelso for his little grandson, a boy whom he always hated and wanted to keep at a distance due to his uncanny resemblance to his mother and for other reasons as well.</t3364> <t3365>It appeared before Dorian's eyes without any change.</t3365> <t3366>Here was that enormous Italian cassone, with its beautifully painted panels and tarnished gilt moldings, in which you used to hide so often as a child.</t3366> <t3367>Here was the lacquered bookcase filled with your dog-eared textbooks.</t3367> <t3368>On the wall behind it still hung that tattered Flanders tapestry, where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a group of falconers rode by, carrying their hooded birds on long-gloved hands.</t3368> <t3369>How clearly you remembered everything! Every moment of your lonely childhood came back to you as you looked around.</t3369> <t3370>You recalled the unstained purity of your childhood, and it seemed so terrible that this was the place where the cursed portrait would be hidden.</t3370> <t3371>You hadn't thought much, in those lost days, about all that had been destined for you!</t3371>
<t3372>1 Chest.</t3372>
<t3373>But there was no other place in the house that could ensure avoiding prying eyes like this one.</t3373> <t3374>You have the key, and no one else can enter.</t3374> <t3375>Under the purple cloth covering the coffin, the face painted on the canvas might gradually become savage, dull, and filthy.</t3375> <t3376>So what?</t3376> <t3377>No one can see it.</t3377> <t3378>Even you will not see it.</t3378> <t3379>Why should you observe the ghastly decay of your soul?</t3379> <t3380>You retain your youth — that is enough. Besides, after all, can't your nature improve?</t3380> <t3381>There is no reason why the future should be filled only with shame.</t3381> <t3382>Perhaps some love might come into your life by chance, purify you, protect you from the sins that seem to have stirred within your soul and flesh — strange sins that cannot be imagined, whose very mystery has added to you the enchantment and allure that belong to them.</t3382> <t3383>Perhaps, one day, the cruelty will disappear from those sensitive red lips, and you can show the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.</t3383>
<t3384>No; that is impossible.</t3384> <t3385>Hour after hour, week after week, the thing on the canvas will grow old.</t3385> <t3386>It may escape the loathsomeness of sin, but the loathsomeness of age is in store for it.</t3386> <t3387>The cheeks will become sunken or flabby.</t3387> <t3388>Sallow crow's feet will creep around the faded eyes and make them horrible.</t3388> <t3389>The hair will lose its luster, the mouth will gape or sag, becoming foolish or gross like that of an old person.</t3389> <t3390>The throat will be wrinkled, the hands cold and veined, the body twisted, like you remember in your grandfather, who was very strict with you in your childhood.</t3390> <t3391>The picture must be hidden away.</t3391> <t3392>This is truly beyond remedy.</t3392>
<t3393>"Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please," he said, tiredly, turning around.</t3393> <t3394>"I'm sorry for keeping you so long.</t3394> <t3395>I was thinking about something else.</t3395><t3396>"</t3396>
<t3397>“It's always nice to have a break, Mr. Gray,” the frame maker replied, still panting. “Where should we put it, sir?”</t3397>
<t3398>“Oh, anywhere is fine.</t3398> <t3399>This is fine.</t3399> <t3400>I don't want to hang it up.</t3400> <t3401>Just lean it against the wall.</t3401> <t3402>Thank you.”</t3402>
<t3403>"May I look at this artwork, sir?"</t3403>
<t3404>Dorian was startled.</t3404> <t3405>"You won't like it, Mr. Hubbard," he said, keeping his eyes fixed on him.</t3405> <t3406>He felt ready to jump on him and knock him to the floor if he dared to lift the splendid curtain that concealed the secret of his life.</t3406> <t3407>"Now I won't trouble you any longer.</t3407> <t3408>I am very grateful that you have kindly come to help.</t3408><t3409>"</t3409>
<t3410>"Nothing, nothing, Mr. Gray.</t3410> <t3411>Always ready to do anything for you, sir." And Mr. Hubbard thumped down the stairs, followed by his assistant, who kept glancing back at Dorian with a shy astonishment on his coarse, awkward face.</t3411> <t3412>He had never seen anyone so wonderful.</t3412>
<t3413>When their footsteps had faded, Dorian locked the door and put the key in his pocket.</t3413> <t3414>Now he felt safe.</t3414> <t3415>No one would ever see that horrible thing again.</t3415> <t3416>No eyes but his own would ever behold his shame again.</t3416>
<t3417>Upon arriving at the library, he saw that it was just past five o'clock, and tea had already been served.</t3417> <t3418>On the small table made of dark fragrant wood inlaid with thick mother-of-pearl — a gift from Mrs. Radley, the wife of his guardian, a charming professional invalid who had spent the previous winter in Cairo — there was a short letter from Lord Henry, and next to it was a book bound in yellow paper, with a slightly torn cover and stained margins.</t3418> <t3419>A third edition of The St. James's Gazette was placed on the tea tray.</t3419> <t3420>It was evident that Victor had returned.</t3420> <t3421>He wondered if Victor had met those people in the hall as they were leaving the house, and if he had managed to extract from them what they had been doing.</t3421> <t3422>Surely he must have noticed the missing painting — he must have certainly noticed it when he set up the tea service.</t3422> <t3423>The screen had not been put back, and a clear gap was visible on the wall.</t3423> <t3424>Perhaps one night he might catch Victor sneaking upstairs and trying to break into that room.</t3424> <t3425>It was terrifying to have a spy in the house.</t3425> <t3426>He had heard of wealthy people being blackmailed for life by a servant who had read a letter, or eavesdropped on a conversation, or picked up a business card with an address, or found a wilted flower or a crumpled lace under a pillow.</t3426>
<t3427>He sighed, and, after pouring himself some tea, opened Lord Henry's letter.</t3427> <t3428>The letter only said that he was sending him the evening newspaper and a book that he might like, and that he would be at the club at a quarter past eight.</t3428> <t3429>He lazily opened The St. James's, skimming through it.</t3429> <t3430>A red pencil mark on page five caught his eye.</t3430> <t3431>It drew attention to the following news item:</t3431>
<t3432>“The investigation into an actress.</t3432> <t3433>—</t3433> <t3434>An investigation was conducted this morning at Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr.</t3434> <t3435>Danby, the coroner for the district, regarding the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently employed at the Royal Theatre, Holborn.</t3435> <t3436>The investigation concluded that the cause of death was accidental.</t3436> <t3437>Great sympathy was expressed for the victim's mother, who was deeply affected while testifying alongside Dr. Birrell, who performed the post-mortem examination on the victim.”</t3437>
<t3438>He frowned, and, tearing the newspaper in half, walked across the room and threw the pieces away.</t3438> <t3439>How frightening everything was!</t3439> <t3440>And the actual frightfulness made everything so terrible!</t3440> <t3441>He felt a bit annoyed with Lord Henry for sending him that report.</t3441> <t3442>And surely he was very foolish to mark it with red pencil.</t3442> <t3443>Victor could have read it.</t3443> <t3444>He knew enough English to do so.</t3444>
<t3445>Maybe he has already read it, and has started to suspect something.</t3445> <t3446>However, so what? What does Dorian Gray have to do with Sibyl Vane's death?</t3446> <t3447>There is nothing to fear. Dorian Gray did not kill her.</t3447>
<t3448>Your eyes noticed the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent you.</t3448> <t3449>What is this, you wondered.</t3449> <t3450>You walked towards the small pearl-colored octagonal shelf that you always thought resembled a structure built by some strange Egyptian bees out of silver, picked up the book, sank into the armchair, and began to flip through the pages.</t3450> <t3451>After a few minutes, you were absorbed.</t3451> <t3452>It was the strangest book you had ever read.</t3452> <t3453>It seemed as if, in beautiful costumes and to the sound of delicate flutes, the sins of this world were parading before you in a silent performance.</t3453> <t3454>Things you had vaguely dreamed of suddenly became real before you.</t3454> <t3455>Things you had never dreamed of slowly revealed themselves.</t3455>
<t3456>It is a novel without a plot and with exactly one character; in fact, it is merely a psychological study of a certain young man from Paris, who has spent his entire life trying to understand, in the nineteenth century, all the passions and methods of thinking that still belong to every century except his own, and to synthesize, so to speak, within himself the different moods that the human soul has experienced, and to love, because of their very artificiality, the sacrifices that people unwisely call virtues, just as the natural rebellions that wise people still call sins.</t3456><t3457>The style in which it is written is also that strangely precious style, both dazzling and dark, filled with slang and archaic words, technical terms, and elaborate annotations, characteristic of the works of some of the most talented artists of the French Symbolist school.</t3457><t3458>In it, there are metaphors as bizarre as orchids, and as subtle as colors.</t3458><t3459>The emotional life is described in mystical philosophical terms.</t3459><t3460>Sometimes it is hard to know whether one is reading the ecstatic states of some medieval saint or the morbid confessions of a contemporary sinner.</t3460><t3461>It is a toxic book.</t3461><t3462>A gloomy incense seems to cling to its pages and disturb the mind.</t3462><t3463>Just the cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of the music filled with what could be called complex refrains and elaborately repeated sections, was enough to induce in the young man's mind, as he moved from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a dreamy illness, making him unaware of the day fading and the stealthy shadows.</t3463>
<t3464>The clear sky, punctured by a solitary star, flickered bronze-blue through the window.</t3464> <t3465>He continued reading under the pale light until he could read no more.</t3465> <t3466>Then, after the servant had reminded him several times that it was late, he finally stood up, went into the next room, placed the book on the small Florence table always beside his bed, and began to change clothes for dinner.</t3466>
<t3467>It was nearly nine o'clock before he arrived at the club, where he found Lord Henry sitting alone in the morning lounge, looking very bored.</t3467>
<t3468>“I am very sorry, Harry,” he exclaimed, “but it really is your fault.</t3468> <t3469>The book you sent me mesmerized me so much that I lost track of time.”</t3469>
<t3470>“Yes: I think you will like it,” the host replied, getting up from the chair.</t3470>
<t3471>“I didn't say I liked it, Harry.</t3471> <t3472>I said it mesmerized me.</t3472> <t3473>There's a big difference.”</t3473>
<t3474>"Ah, you have discovered that, have you?" Lord Henry whispered.</t3474> <t3475>And they walked through the dining room.</t3475>
<t3476>Chapter 11</t3476>
<t3477>For many years, Dorian Gray could not escape the influence of this book.</t3477> <t3478>Or perhaps, more accurately, he never tried to escape from it.</t3478> <t3479>He acquired no fewer than nine deluxe editions of the first printing from Paris, binding them in different colors so they could match the diverse moods and whimsical imaginations of a nature over which he seemed, at times, to have almost lost control.</t3479> <t3480>He saw the main character, a marvelous young Parisian, in whom romantic and scientific temperaments were strangely blended, as a kind of prototype of himself.</t3480> <t3481>And, indeed, he felt as if the entire book contained the story of his life, written before he had lived it.</t3481>
<t3482>There is one point where you are luckier than the imaginary character in that novel.</t3482> <t3483>You have never known — indeed, there has never been any reason for you to know — the somewhat peculiar fear of mirrors, shiny metal surfaces, and still water, a fear that weighed heavily on the young Parisian from an early age, caused by the sudden decay of a beauty that once seemed quite exceptional.</t3483> <t3484>With an almost cruel joy — and perhaps in most joys, just as in all pleasures, cruelty always has its place — you often read the latter part of the book, with its truly tragic description, if not slightly overemphasized, of the sorrow and despair of someone who has lost what they cherished most in others and in the world.</t3484>
<t3485>Because the miraculous beauty that had enchanted Basil Hallward and many others besides him seemed never to have left him.</t3485> <t3486>Even those who had heard the worst things about him, not to mention the occasional strange rumors about his lifestyle that buzzed around London and became the talk of the clubs, still could not believe anything about his disgrace when they met him.</t3486> <t3487>He always had the appearance of someone who had kept himself untouched by the dust of the world.</t3487> <t3488>Those who were speaking obscenities would fall silent when Dorian Gray entered the room.</t3488> <t3489>There was something in the purity of his face that reproached them.</t3489> <t3490>His mere presence seemed enough to remind them of the memory of innocence they had defiled.</t3490> <t3491>They wondered how someone as exceedingly charming and elegant as he could have avoided the stains of an age both sordid and licentious.</t3491>
<t3492>Usually, when returning home from one of those long and mysterious absences that always sparked the most bizarre speculations among those who were his friends, or thought they were, he would sneak upstairs to enter that locked room, open the door with the key that had never left his side, and stand, with a mirror, before the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, sometimes looking at the evil, aging face on the canvas, other times at the youthful, beautiful face smiling at him from the polished glass.</t3492> <t3493>It was the sharpness of the contrast that often heightened his capacity for pleasure.</t3493> <t3494>He became increasingly enamored with his own beauty, and increasingly attentive to the decay of his soul.</t3494> <t3495>He examined every detail, sometimes with a terrible, perverse joy, the hideous wrinkles that marred the withered forehead, or crept around the lecherous mouth, sometimes wondering which was more dreadful, the signs of sin or the signs of age.</t3495> <t3496>He often placed his own immaculate white hands next to the swollen, coarse hands in the painting, and smiled.</t3496> <t3497>He mocked that distorted body and those enfeebled limbs.</t3497>
<t3498>Indeed, there were many times, at night, when, lying awake in the gentle fragrance of his own bedroom, or in the filthy room of the infamous little tavern near the Harbor, where, under a false name, and dressed in disguise, he frequented, he would think about the degradation he had brought upon his soul, with a sorrow even more intense because it was purely selfish.</t3498> <t3499>But such moments were very rare.</t3499> <t3500>The curiosity about life that Lord Henry had first awakened in him, when they sat together in their friend's garden, seemed to increase with satisfaction.</t3500> <t3501>The more he knew, the more he wanted to know.</t3501> <t3502>He had frenzied hungers that grew more intense the more he fed them.</t3502>
<t3503>However, no matter what, he was never really careless in social relationships.</t3503> <t3504>A couple of times each winter month, and every Wednesday afternoon during other seasons, he would throw open his beautiful house to the world and hire the most famous musicians of the day to enchant his guests with their artistic feats.</t3504> <t3505>His afternoon parties, which Lord Henry always helped him arrange, were renowned for the careful selection and arrangement of the guests, as well as for the refined taste displayed in the table decorations, with delicate harmonies of exotic flowers, embroidered tablecloths, and ancient gold and silver plates.</t3505> <t3506>Indeed, many people, especially among the very young, saw, or thought they saw, in Dorian Gray, the true realization of an ideal they had dreamed of during their days at Eton or Oxford, a person who combined the essential elements of a true scholar's culture with all the grace, distinction, and perfect style of a cosmopolitan citizen.</t3506> <t3507>To them, it seemed that he belonged to the group of people whom Dante described as seeking to “perfect themselves through the worship of beauty.”</t3507> <t3508>According to Gautier, he was one of those for whom “this visible world exists.”</t3508>
<t3509>And, surely for you, Life itself is the first and greatest art of all arts, because with it, all other arts seem merely a preparation.</t3509> <t3510>Fashion, which makes the truly bizarre become commonplace in an instant, and Dressing up, which, in its own way, is an effort to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, naturally fascinated you.</t3510> <t3511>Your way of dressing, and the unique styles you occasionally favored, had a clear influence on the dandies of Mayfair balls and the club windows of Pall Mall, who copied everything you did, trying to emulate the casual charm of your graceful yet half-serious dressing style.</t3511>
<t3512>Because, although he was more than willing to assume the status almost immediately offered to him at adulthood, and, indeed, had found a subtle joy in the thought that he could truly become, to London in his time, what the author of Satyricon had once become to Rome in the time of Emperor Nero, nevertheless, deep down, he still wished to become someone of higher standing than merely an arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on how to wear jewels, or tie a cravat, or use a cane.</t3512> <t3513>He sought to establish some new schema of life, with a rigorous philosophy and consistent principles, and sought to realize it to the highest degree by spiritualizing the senses.</t3513>
<t3514>1 A person knowledgeable about elegance.</t3514> <t3515>(Latin)</t3515>
<t3516>The worship of the senses has been frequently and quite justly maligned, as humans feel a natural instinct of fear towards passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves and recognize them as shared with lower forms of organized existence.</t3516><t3517>But Dorian Gray believed that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they remained savage and bestial only because the world sought to starve them into submission or kill them with pain, instead of aiming to make them the basis of a new faith, where the noble instinct for beauty would be the predominant characteristic.</t3517><t3518>As he looked at humanity passing through History, he was haunted by a sense of loss.</t3518><t3519>How many things had been renounced! and for such petty purposes!</t3519><t3520>Stubborn, mad refusals, ghastly forms of self-torture and self-denial whose origins were fear and whose results were a degradation infinitely more terrible than the imagined degradation they, in their ignorance, sought to escape.</t3520><t3521>Mother Nature, with her marvelous irony, drives the hermit away and feeds him with the wild beasts of the desert, and brings the animals of the plain to the recluse to be his companions.</t3521>
<t3522>Correct: as Lord Henry predicted, a new Hedonism will emerge, capable of rejuvenating life, saving it from the harsh, graceless morality that is strangely reviving in our era.</t3522> <t3523>It will certainly seek the aid of intellect; however, it will never accept any theory or system that demands the sacrifice of any form of passionate experience.</t3523> <t3524>Its purpose, indeed, is the experience itself, not the fruits of the experience, whether they be sweet or bitter.</t3524> <t3525>As for the asceticism that dulls the senses, and the common debauchery that blunts them, it knows nothing.</t3525> <t3526>But it teaches man to focus entirely on the moments of a life that, in its essence, is but a moment.</t3526>
<t3527>Some of us occasionally wake up before dawn, or after one of those dreamless nights that almost make us fall in love with death, or one of those grotesque and joyous nights, when, through the brain's chambers, flit shadows more terrifying than reality itself, sharing the same instinct with the vibrant life that lurks in every bizarre painting and supplements its eternal vitality to Gothic art, an art that, we can imagine, is especially the art of those who suffer from hypochondria.</t3527><t3528>Gradually, white fingers crawl through the curtains, and they emerge before the trembling.</t3528><t3529>In grotesque black garb, silent shadows crawl into the room's corners, hiding there.</t3529><t3530>Outside, birds chirp in the leaves, or the sound of people heading to work, or the sighing whisper of the wind blowing down from the hills and wandering around the quiet house, as if afraid to wake those who are deeply asleep, yet still needing to call sleep out of its purple cave.</t3530><t3531>One dark curtain after another is drawn up, the shapes and colors of things gradually recover, and we watch the dawn recreate the world in its ancient pattern.</t3531><t3532>The pale mirrors regain their imitative life.</t3532><t3533>The unlit candles still stand where we left them, and beside them lies the partially cut book we are studying, or the ribbon-tied flower we wore at the ball yesterday, or the letter we fear to read, or the letter we read too often.</t3533><t3534>It seems to us that nothing has changed.</t3534><t3535>The real life we know has returned from the unreal shadows.</t3535><t3536>We resume it where we left off, and within us spreads a dreadful awareness of the necessity to continue actively with the same weary round of stereotyped habits, or a fierce longing that, perhaps, one morning our eyelids might open to a world refurbished in the darkness for our delight, a world in which everything will have fresh shapes and colors, will change, or have other secrets, a world in which the past has little or no place, or at least cannot survive in any form of consciousness of duty or regret, for even the recollection of joy has a bitter taste, and the memory of pleasure has its pain.</t3536>
<t3537>It seems that for Dorian Gray, the true purpose, or among the true purposes, of life is precisely the creation of such worlds; and in the quest for sensations that are both new and pleasing, and possessing that element of "novelty" which is so essential to romance, he often adhered to certain lines of thought that he knew were truly contrary to his nature, immersing himself in their subtle influences, and then, having, so to speak, captured their color and satisfied his curiosity, he abandoned them with a strange indifference that was not incompatible with the genuinely passionate temperament which, indeed, according to some modern psychologists, is always one of its states.</t3537>
<t3538>There was a time when people rumored that you were about to join the Roman Catholic Church; and indeed, the Roman rite always had a great allure for you.</t3538> <t3539>The daily sacrifice, truly more terrifying than any sacrifice of the ancient world, moved you with its grand rejection of sensory evidence just as much as with the primal simplicity of its elements and the eternal inspiration of the human tragedy it sought to symbolize.</t3539> <t3540>You liked kneeling on the cold marble floor, watching the priest, dressed in stiff brocade vestments, slowly and with white hands, draw aside the veil of the tabernacle, or lift above his head a monstrance adorned with jewels containing the pale host that one might sometimes be willing to think was indeed "panis cælestis," the bread of angels, or, wearing the robe of Christ's passion, break the host into the chalice, and strike his breast for his sins.</t3540> <t3541>The smoking censers, which solemn altar boys, dressed in lace and bright red garments, swung into the air like large gilded flowers, had a subtle fascination for you.</t3541> <t3542>When you left, you often looked with wonder at the dark confessionals, longing to sit in the dim light of one of them and listen to men and women whisper through the worn-out grille the true story of their lives.</t3542>
<t3543>But he never fell into the mistake of stifling his intellectual development by accepting any formal creed or system, or confusing, with the house he lived in, an inn only suitable for staying a short while during the night, or a few hours in a night without stars and a painful moon.</t3543> <t3544>Occultism, with its marvelous ability to make ordinary things strange to us, and the lawless mysticism that always seemed to accompany it, softened his heart for a season; and for a season he leaned towards the materialist doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, finding strange joy in tracing human thoughts and passions to some pearl-like brain cell, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the idea of the soul's absolute dependence on certain natural conditions, whether sick or healthy, normal or corrupt.</t3544> <t3545>However, as previously mentioned about him, he seemed to find no theory of life as important when compared to life itself.</t3545> <t3546>He clearly saw how futile all intellectual study would be when separated from action and experimentation.</t3546> <t3547>He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, had spiritual mysteries waiting to be discovered.</t3547>
<t3548>And so, at this moment, he began to study perfumes, with the secrets of their creation, the distillation of concentrated fragrant oils, and the burning of aromatic resins from the East. He found that there was no mood that did not have its counterpart in the realm of sensuality, and he forced himself to explore the precise connections between them, wondering what it was in African incense that made people become mysterious, in ambergris that could stimulate human passions, in heliotrope that could awaken memories of dead loves, in musk that could disturb the brain, in ylang-ylang that could color the imagination; and he often sought to establish a true psychological theory of perfumes, to evaluate the effects of fragrant roots and heavily powdered flowers, or fragrant oils, of black sandalwood, of the loathsome camphor tree, of the maddening spikenard, of the aloe wood that was rumored to be able to drive away melancholy from the soul.</t3548>
<t3549>At other times, he would devote himself entirely to music, and in the long room with lattice windows, a gilded ceiling, and olive-green walls, he often held strange concerts, where frenzied Gypsies would tear wild music from tiny dulcimers, or solemn Tunisians wrapped in yellow shawls would pluck the taut strings of enormous lutes, while grinning black men beat steadily on copper drums, and, bent over red carpets, slender Indians with turbans would blow through long reed or brass pipes, mesmerizing, or pretending to mesmerize, giant cobras and terrifying horned vipers.</t3549><t3550>The dissonant intervals and shrill, discordant notes of barbaric music excited him at times when the grace of Schubert, the beautiful sorrow of Chopin, and the powerful harmonies of Beethoven himself could not capture his ear.</t3550><t3551>He collected from all over the world the strangest musical instruments he could find, both from the tombs of dead civilizations and among a few savage tribes that still maintained some contact with Western civilization, and he enjoyed touching and trying them.</t3551><t3552>He had the mysterious juruparis of the Indians of the Rio Negro, an instrument that women were not allowed to see, and young men could not behold until they had undergone fasting and whipping, and the earthenware jar of the Peruvians, with its shrill bird call, and human bone flutes like those Alfonso de Ovalle had heard in Chili, and the green quartz crystal that resonated, found near Cuzco, capable of producing a single sweet note.</t3552><t3553>He drew sketches of gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when shaken; the long clarin of the Mexicans, which the performer did not blow into but inhaled air through; the rough ture of the Amazon tribes, which emitted sound thanks to little guards who sat all day in tall trees and could be heard, it was said, from three miles away; the teponaztli, with its two wooden tongues struck by sticks coated in a flexible gum obtained from tree sap; the yotl bells of the Aztecs, hung in clusters like grapes; and the enormous cylindrical drum, covered with the skin of giant snakes, like the one Bernal Diaz saw when he accompanied Cortes into a Mexican temple, and which he left us a vivid description of its mournful sound.</t3553><t3554>The bizarre characteristics of these instruments fascinated him, and he felt a strange pleasure in thinking that Art, like Nature, had its monsters, things that wore the guise of beasts and had hideous voices.</t3554><t3555>However, after a while, he grew tired of them and returned to his box at the opera house, either alone or with Lord Henry, entranced by Tannhäuser, and found in the prelude of that masterpiece an expression of the tragedy of his own soul.</t3555>
<t3556>Once, he took up the study of gemstones and appeared at a masquerade ball as Anne de Joyeuse, the Admiral of France, dressed in an outfit adorned with five hundred and sixty pearls.</t3556> <t3557>This hobby fascinated him for many years, and, indeed, it could be said that it never truly left him.</t3557> <t3558>He often spent entire days arranging and rearranging in a box the various stones he had collected, such as olive-green tiger's eye that turned red under lamplight, cat's eye with a silver streak like a wire, twilight emeralds the color of pistachios, pink and wine-yellow topaz, fiery red garnets with shimmering four-pointed stars, fiery cinnamon stones, orange and purple spinel rubies, and amethysts with alternating layers of ruby and sapphire.</t3558> <t3559>He loved the reddish-yellow hue of sunstone, the pearly white of moonstone, and the broken rainbow hues of milky opal.</t3559> <t3560>He acquired from Amsterdam three particularly large and richly colored emeralds, and a turquoise de la vieille roche that every connoisseur coveted.</t3560>
<t3561>You also discovered the miraculous stories about gemstones.</t3561> <t3562>In Alphonso's Clericalis Disciplina, a snake is mentioned with real orange gem eyes, and in the romantic history of Alexander, it is rumored that the Conqueror of Emathia found in the valley of Jordan snakes “with real emerald necklaces growing on their backs.”</t3562> <t3563>There are gems in the brains of dragons, Philostratus tells us, and “by displaying golden letters and red cloaks,” the monster can be thrown into a magical sleep and killed.</t3563> <t3564>According to the great alchemist Pierre de Boniface, diamonds make a person invisible, and Indian agate makes one eloquent.</t3564> <t3565>Hornstone1 calms anger, while chalcedony2 induces sleep, and amethyst wards off drunkenness.</t3565> <t3566>Garnet drives away evil spirits, while aquamarine3 steals the color of the moon.</t3566> <t3567>Moonstone4 waxes and wanes with the moon, while bloodstone5, which detects thieves, can only be influenced by the blood of a child.</t3567> <t3568>Leonardus Camillus saw a white stone taken from the brain of a freshly killed toad, which was certainly an antidote.</t3568> <t3569>The bezoar6 stone, found in the heart of an Arabian deer,</t3569> <t3570>is an amulet that cures the plague.</t3570> <t3571>In the nests of Arabian birds, there are firestones7, a type of stone, according to Democritus, that keeps the bearer safe from the danger of fire.</t3571>

<t3579>The King of Ceylon rode through the city with a large ruby in his hand, during his coronation ceremony.</t3579> <t3580>The palace gates of Priest John were “made of orange jade, interspersed with the horns of horned vipers, so that no one could bring poison inside.”</t3580> <t3581>On the pediment were “two golden apples, within them were two garnets,” so that gold could shine during the day, and garnets at night.</t3581> <t3582>In Lodge's strange novel A Margarite of America, it is mentioned that in the queen's bedroom one could see “every maiden in the world, embossed from silver, viewed through beautiful mirrors of topaz, garnet, jade, and emerald.” Marco Polo once saw the inhabitants of Zipangu place pink pearls in the mouths of the dead.</t3582> <t3583>A sea monster fell in love with a pearl that a pearl diver offered to King Perozes, so it killed the thief, and mourned for seven moons to satisfy its loss.</t3583> <t3584>When the Huns lured the King into a great trap pit, he threw it away —</t3584> <t3585>Procopius recounted that story — and it was never found again, although Emperor Anastasius promised to pay five hundred pounds of gold for it.</t3585> <t3586>The King of Malabar showed a Venetian a rosary made of three hundred and four pearls, each for a deity he worshipped.</t3586>
<t3587>When the Duke of Valentinois, son of Alexander VI, visited King Louis XII of France, his horse was laden with gold leaf, according to Brantôme, and his hat had two rows of beautifully shining rubies.</t3587> <t3588>The King of England, Charles, rode a horse with stirrups adorned with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds.</t3588> <t3589>Richard II had a cloak worth thirty thousand marks, covered in spinel rubies.</t3589> <t3590>Hall describes Henry VIII, on his way to the Tower before his coronation, as wearing “a gold-embroidered vest, a breastplate embroidered with diamonds and precious stones, and a grand collar of large spinel stones.” The favorites of James I wore emerald earrings set in finely crafted gold settings.</t3590> <t3591>Edward II gifted Piers Gaveston a suit of red gold armor adorned with orange gems, a necklace of golden roses set with turquoise, and a cap studded with pearls.</t3591> <t3592>Henry II wore gloves adorned with gems up to the elbows, and had a falconer’s glove sewn with twenty rubies and fifty-two large pearls.</t3592> <t3593>The ducal hat of Charles the Bold, the last Duke of Burgundy of his line, was adorned with pear-shaped pearls and emeralds.</t3593>

<t3597>How wonderful life was in the past!</t3597> <t3598>How splendid its vanity and decorations were!</t3598> <t3599>Even just reading about the opulence of those who have passed away is enough to be marvelous.</t3599>
<t3600>Then he shifted his attention to embroidery, and to the tapestries that served as wall hangings in the cold rooms of the Northern Europeans. When he studied this subject — and he always had an extraordinary ability to become utterly fascinated with anything he touched — he was almost saddened by the shadow of decay that Time cast upon such marvelous beauties.</t3600> <t3601>Nevertheless, he avoided that fate.</t3601> <t3602>Summer after summer, the golden immortelle bloomed and withered many times, the dreadful nights endlessly retold their tales of shame, yet he remained unchanged.</t3602> <t3603>No winter could harm his face or tarnish his flower-like beauty.</t3603> <t3604>How different it was from material things! Where had they gone?</t3604> <t3605>Where was the great saffron-yellow cloak, on which gods fought against giants, a work that brown-skinned girls made to please Athena?</t3605> <t3606>Where was the enormous canvas that Nero stretched across the Colosseum in Rome, the giant's purple sail depicting a starry sky, with Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white horses with golden reins?</t3606> <t3607>He longed to see the strange napkins crafted for the sun priest, upon which every delicacy needed for a feast was displayed; the mourning cloth of King Chilperic, with three hundred golden bees; the bizarre cloaks that incited the wrath of Bishop Pontus, adorned with images of “lions, leopards, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters — everything that an artist could realistically copy from nature;” and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, with the sleeves embroidered with the verses of a song beginning with “Madame, je suis tout joyeux,” the musical accompaniment sewn in gold thread, and each note, square at that time, made from four pearls.</t3607> <t3608>He read about the room prepared at the palace in Rheims for Queen Joan of Burgundy, decorated with “one thousand three hundred and twenty-one parrots, created by embroidery, adorned with the king's insignia, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly decorated with the queen's insignia, all crafted in gold.” Catherine de Médicis had a mourning bed made for her of black velvet adorned with crescent moons and suns.</t3608> <t3609>Its curtains were of Damascus silk with wreaths and garlands printed on a gold and silver background, fringed with pearl embroidery, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's insignia cut out of black velvet on silver silk.</t3609> <t3610>Louis XIV had golden embroidered caryatids fifteen minutes high in his chamber.</t3610> <t3611>The bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold-embroidered silk adorned with turquoise and inscribed with verses from the Koran.</t3611> <t3612>Its supports were gilded silver, exquisitely carved, and encrusted with countless enameled medallions and gemstones.</t3612> <t3613>It was taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the banner of the prophet Mohammed once stood beneath its shimmering gilded dome.</t3613>
<t3614>And so, throughout the year, he sought to collect the finest specimens he could find of textiles and embroidery, acquiring elegant Delhi muslin, intricately crafted with gold thread palm motifs and sewn with iridescent beetle wings; Dacca muslin, known in the East for its transparency as "woven air," "running water," and "evening dew"; exotic floral fabrics from Java; elaborate golden tapestries from China; books bound in tawny satin or exquisite blue silk, adorned with fleurs de lys, birds, and illustrations; lacis lace embroidered with Hungarian needlework; Sicilian embroidered brocade, stiff Spanish velvet; Georgian-era pieces with gilded coins, and Japanese Foukousas with golden-green hues and birds with magnificent plumage.</t3614>
<t3615>Lily (lily, trumpet lily): a stylized motif used as a symbol or decoration.</t3615>
<t3616>2 Gift-wrapping cloths (according to Japanese tradition).</t3616>
<t3617>You also have a special passion for clerical vestments, and indeed you have everything related to religious matters.</t3617> <t3618>In the long cedar chests lined up in the west gallery of your house, you store many beautiful and rare specimens of what truly are the garments for the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen to hide the pallor of a body emaciated by mortification and worn by the suffering she implores, and wounded by self-inflicted punishment.</t3618>
<t3619>You possess a magnificent chasuble made of deep red silk and gold-threaded Damascus brocade, decorated with repeating motifs of golden pomegranates set within solemn six-petaled flowers, outside of which, on both sides, are pineapples made of small pearls.</t3619> <t3620>The embroidered border of the robe is divided into fabric panels depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, and the coronation of the Virgin Mary is depicted in colored silk on the hood.</t3620> <t3621>It is an Italian work from the fifteenth century.</t3621> <t3622>The other chasuble is made of green velvet, embroidered with groups of heart-shaped holly leaves, from which long-stemmed white flowers radiate, their details highlighted with silver thread and colored crystals.</t3622> <t3623>The clasp bears the embroidered image of a cherub's head in gold thread.</t3623> <t3624>The border is woven with red and gold silk diamonds, featuring medallions of various saints and martyrs, among whom is Saint Sebastian.</t3624> <t3625>You also have chasubles made of amber silk, blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow Damascus silk with golden fabric, depicting scenes of the Passion and the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, embroidered lions with peacocks and other symbols; slit albs made of white satin and pink Damascus silk, decorated with tulips with dolphins and fleurs-de-lys; altar frontals of deep red velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice veils, and purificators.</t3625> <t3626>In the mystical ceremonies for which such items were used, there was something that stimulated your imagination.</t3626>
<t3627>Because these treasures, along with everything he had collected in his lovely home, had become the means for him to forget quickly, the ways by which he could escape, for a season, from the fear that he sometimes felt had grown almost unbearably large.</t3627> <t3628>On the walls of the lonely, locked room where he had spent most of his childhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the true degeneration of his life, and in front of it hung that gold-and-purple coffin cloth as a curtain.</t3628> <t3629>In the weeks he did not go in there, he would forget that terrible drawing, and regain a light heart, a marvelous joy, a passionate enthusiasm for a full life.</t3629> <t3630>Then, suddenly, one night, he would sneak out of the house again, go down to the dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields and stay there, day after day, until he was driven away.</t3630> <t3631>Upon returning, he would sit before the painting again, sometimes hating both it and himself, but at other times, filled with pride in the individualism that was half the fascination of sin, and laugh with secret joy at the distorted shadow bearing the burden that should have been his.</t3631>
<t3632>After a few years, he couldn't stand being anywhere for long outside of England, and returned the villa at Trouville where he stayed with Lord Henry, as well as the white, high-walled house in Algiers where they had spent more than one winter.</t3632> <t3633>He didn't like being separated from the painting that had truly become a part of his life, and he was also afraid that in his absence someone might get into the room, despite the elaborate locks he had ordered to be placed on the door.</t3633>
<t3634>You know very well that this won't reveal anything to them.</t3634> <t3635>Indeed, the portrait still remains, despite all the dirt and ugliness on the face, the resemblance to you is clear; but what will they learn from that?</t3635> <t3636>You would laugh in the face of anyone who tries to insult you.</t3636> <t3637>You didn't paint it.</t3637> <t3638>What does it have to do with you how vile and disgraceful it looks?</t3638> <t3639>Even if you told them, would they believe it?</t3639>
<t3640>However, he was still afraid.</t3640> <t3641>Occasionally, when he went down to his large house in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the elegant young men of his class and his friends, and astonishing the entire county with the extravagant debauchery and the marvelous splendor of his lifestyle, he would suddenly abandon his guests and rush back to the city to find that the door had not been touched, and the painting was still there.</t3641> <t3642>What if it were stolen?</t3642> <t3643>Just the thought of it made him shiver with fear.</t3643> <t3644>Surely then the world would know his secret.</t3644> <t3645>Perhaps the world already suspected it.</t3645>
<t3646>Because, while he enchanted many people, there were still a few who did not believe him.</t3646> <t3647>He almost faced a vote against him at a West End club where his lineage and social status gave him full rights to become a member, and it was rumored that on one occasion when he was brought into the smoking room by a friend, Churchill, the Duke of Berwick, and another gentleman stood up in clear disapproval and left.</t3647> <t3648>Strange stories about him became common after he turned twenty-five.</t3648> <t3649>It was rumored that he was caught arguing with foreign sailors in a dive bar in the depths of Whitechapel, that he associated with thieves and counterfeiters and knew their business secrets.</t3649> <t3650>His unusual absences became notorious, and when he reappeared in high society, people whispered to each other in corners, or passed by him with contemptuous smiles, or looked at him with cold, scrutinizing eyes, as if they were determined to uncover his secrets.</t3650>
<t3651>For such deliberate insolence and disdain, he, of course, didn't bother to pay attention, and in the view of most people, his straightforward and generous attitude, his charming boyish smile, and the endless charm of his marvelous youth, which seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a persuasive enough answer to the slanders, as they called them, that continued to spread about him.</t3651> <t3652>However, it was clear that some of those who had been closest to him, after a while, began to avoid him.</t3652> <t3653>The women who worshipped him madly, defying all high society's criticisms and challenging all conventions for his sake, were seen to turn pale with shame or fear if Dorian Gray entered the room.</t3653>
<t3654>However, those scandals only increased, in the eyes of many, his strange and dangerous allure.</t3654> <t3655>His great wealth was also a certain safety factor.</t3655> <t3656>Society, at least civilized society, is never willing to believe anything that harms those who are both rich and attractive.</t3656> <t3657>It instinctively feels that attitude is more important than virtue, and, in its view, the most respectable character is worth far less than having a good chef.</t3657> <t3658>And, after all, we are hardly consoled when told that the person who gave us a lousy dinner, or terrible wine, is blameless in their private life.</t3658> <t3659>Even warm-hearted kindness cannot redeem a cold appetizer, as Lord Henry once remarked, in a discussion on this subject; and perhaps there is much to be said for his perspective.</t3659> <t3660>For the standards of a good society are, or should be, the same as those of art.</t3660> <t3661>Form is an absolutely necessary element for it.</t3661> <t3662>It should have the solemnity as well as the unreality of a ritual, and should combine the insincerity of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays enjoyable to us.</t3662> <t3663>Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not.</t3663> <t3664>It is merely a way to multiply our personalities.</t3664>
<t3665>Anyway, that was Dorian Gray's perspective.</t3665><t3666>He often found it strange how shallow the mentality of those who perceived the Self in humans as something simple, enduring, reliable, and inherent to a nature.</t3666><t3667>To him, humans were creatures with countless lives and countless sensations, complex and diverse beings, carrying within them strange legacies of thoughts and passions, and their flesh was infected with grotesque diseases from the deceased.</t3667><t3668>He enjoyed wandering through the desolate, cold galleries in his mansion and gazing at the various portraits of those whose blood ran through his veins.</t3668><t3669>Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne in the book "Memories of the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James," as someone "flattered by the Court for his handsome face, which did not stay with him long."</t3669><t3670>Was it Herbert's youthful life that he sometimes experienced?</t3670><t3671>Was there some peculiar disease that kept spreading from body to body until it reached his own?</t3671><t3672>Was it some vague awareness of that fading beauty that made him, quite unexpectedly and almost without reason, utter in Basil Hallward's studio the mad prayer that changed his life so?</t3672><t3673>Here, wearing a red doublet embroidered with gold, a jeweled cloak, gold-edged cuffs, and a ruffled collar, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with black-and-silver armor piled at his feet.</t3673><t3674>What was this man's legacy? Did Giovanna of Naples' lover pass down to him some inheritance of sin and shame?</t3674><t3675>Were his actions merely dreams that the deceased dared not fulfill?</t3675><t3676>Here, from the faded canvas, Elizabeth Devereux smiled, wearing a veiled hat, a pearl-studded bodice, and slashed pink sleeves.</t3676><t3677>A flower in her right hand, while her left hand clutched an enameled ring bearing the image of white and Damask roses. On the table beside her lay a mandolin and an apple.</t3677><t3678>There were large green rose bows on her small pointed shoes.</t3678><t3679>He knew her life and the strange tales told about her lovers.</t3679><t3680>Did he possess something of her temperament?</t3680><t3681>Those drooping oval eyes seemed to look at him curiously.</t3681><t3682>And what about George Willoughby, with his powdered hair and bizarre fake moles?</t3682><t3683>How vile he looked!</t3683><t3684>His sullen, dark face, and his lustful lips seemed twisted with disdain.</t3684><t3685>The soft ruffled lace cuffs hung down his thin, yellow, ring-laden hands.</t3685><t3686>He was a rake in the style of eighteenth-century Europe and in his youth was a friend of Lord Ferrars.</t3686><t3687>And what about the second Lord Beckenham, a friend of the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret wedding with Mrs. Fitzherbert?</t3687><t3688>How proud and handsome he was, with his chestnut curls and insolent posture!</t3688><t3689>What passions did he pass down?</t3689><t3690>People regarded him as a disgrace.</t3690><t3691>He led the orgies at Carlton House.</t3691><t3692>The Garter star sparkled on his chest.</t3692><t3693>Beside him hung the portrait of his wife, a pale woman with thin lips, dressed in black.</t3693><t3694>Her blood also flowed within him.</t3694><t3695>How strange all this seemed! And his mother with Lady Hamilton's face and moist wine-stained lips — he knew what he inherited from her.</t3695><t3696>From her, he inherited beauty and a passion for the beauty of others.</t3696><t3697>She smiled at him in the loose garments of a Bacchus worshiper.</t3697><t3698>There were vine leaves in her hair.</t3698><t3699>Purple spilled from the goblet she held.</t3699><t3700>The carnations in the painting had withered, but the eyes remained wonderfully deep and vibrant.</t3700><t3701>They seemed to follow him wherever he went.</t3701>

<t3703>But people have ancestors in literature just as in lineage, perhaps many of these literary ancestors are even closer in type and temperament, and certainly have an influence that we can perceive more perfectly.</t3703> <t3704>There are times when Dorian Gray feels that all of history is merely the record of his own life, not as he lives it through actions and circumstances, but as his imagination has created it for him, as it exists in his mind and passions.</t3704> <t3705>He feels that he has known all of them, those terrible and strange characters who have passed through the stage of the world and made sin so marvelous, and evil so full of subtlety.</t3705> <t3706>He feels as if, in some mysterious way, their lives have become his own.</t3706>
<t3707>The main character of the captivating novel had such a strong influence on his life that he had come to know this strange imagination.</t3707> <t3708>In chapter seven, he recounts how, wearing a laurel wreath to avoid being struck by lightning, he sat, like Tiberius, in the garden at Capri, reading the infamous book of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted around, and a flute player mocked the incense swinger; and, like Caligula, feasting with green-robed jockeys in the stables, dining in an ivory trough with a jeweled-browed horse; and, like Domitian, wandering through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking around with weary eyes for the shadow of the dagger that ended his life, sickened by that tedium vitæ1, that terrible ennui that comes to those whom life denies nothing; and peering through a transparent emerald into the blazing slaughterhouse of the Arena2, then, on a pearl and purple litter drawn by silver-hoofed mules, being carried through the streets of Pomegranates to the Golden House, hearing people shout Nero Cæsar as he passed by; and, like Elagabalus, painting his face, diligently spinning among women, bringing the Moon from Carthage, offering her to the Sun in a mystical wedding.</t3708>

<t3711>2 Circus, an arena that predates the Colosseum in Rome.</t3711>
<t3712>Dorian often read and reread this strange chapter and the two chapters immediately following it, in which, like on some strange tapestries or finely crafted enamel paintings, were depicted the beautiful and majestic forms of those whom Corruption and Blood and Ennui had driven mad or grotesque: Filippo, Duke of Milan, who killed his wife and painted her lips with bright red poison so that her lover could suck death from the deadly thing he kissed; Pietro Barbi, a Venetian, known as Pope Paul II, who sought to claim the title of Formosus out of arrogance, and whose crown, worth two hundred thousand florins, was bought at the cost of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used dogs to hunt living people, and whose assassinated corpse was covered with roses by the harlot who loved him; The Borgias on white horses, with Incest and Fratricide riding beside them, Perotto's blood-stained cloak; Pietro Riario, the Cardinal</t3712> <t3713>young Archbishop of Florence, son and subordinate of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was matched only by his depravity, and who hosted Leonora of Aragon in a red and white silk tent, filled with goddesses and centaurs, and gilded a boy so that he could serve at banquets as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could only be cured by death, who loved red blood as others love red wine — rumored to be the Devil's son, and who deceived his father in a dice game by wagering his soul; Giambattista Cibo, who took the name Innocent to mock, and in whose sluggish veins the blood of three boys was transfused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, lover of Isotta, lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned in Rome as an enemy of God and mankind, who strangled Polyssena with a napkin, poisoned Ginevra d'Este with an emerald cup, and in honor of a shameful passion built a pagan temple to worship Jesus; Charles VI, who was so madly in love with his sister-in-law that a leper warned him of the madness coming upon him, and who, when his brain was diseased and strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards depicting Love and Death and Madness; and, dressed neatly in leather doublet, wearing a jeweled cap with curls like holly leaves, Grifonetto Baglioni, who killed Astorre with his bride and Simonetto with his page, whose beauty was so great that when he lay dead in the golden square of Perugia, even those who hated him could not help but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.</t3713>

<t3717>There is a terrible fascination in all of them.</t3717> <t3718>You see them at night, and they torment your imagination by day.</t3718> <t3719>The Renaissance knew of strange ways of poisoning — poisoning by helmet and bright torch, by embroidered glove and jeweled fan, by gilded pineapple and by amber necklace.</t3719> <t3720>Dorian Gray was poisoned by a book.</t3720> <t3721>There are times when you see evil merely as a means by which you can realize your conception of beauty.</t3721>
<t3722>Chapter 12</t3722>
<t3723>It was on the ninth of November, the night before your thirty-eighth birthday, as you often recall later.</t3723>
<t3724>You were walking home at around eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's house, where you had dinner, wrapped in a thick fur coat because the night was cold and foggy.</t3724> <t3725>At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a man passed by you in the fog, walking very quickly, with the collar of his gray ulster coat turned up.</t3725> <t3726>He was carrying a bag in his hand.</t3726> <t3727>Dorian recognized him.</t3727> <t3728>It was Basil Hallward.</t3728> <t3729>A strange fear, which he could not explain, came over him.</t3729> <t3730>He did not show any sign of recognition and continued to walk briskly towards his home.</t3730>
<t3731>But Hallward had seen him.</t3731> <t3732>Dorian heard him first stop on the sidewalk, then hurriedly follow him.</t3732> <t3733>A moment later, his hand was on his arm.</t3733>
<t3734>“Dorian! How fortunate! I have been waiting for you in your library since nine o'clock.</t3734> <t3735>Finally, I felt sorry for your tired servant and told him to go to bed when he let me out.</t3735> <t3736>I will be going to Paris on the midnight train, and I especially wanted to see you before I leave.</t3736> <t3737>I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, when you passed by me.</t3737> <t3738>But I wasn't quite sure.</t3738> <t3739>Did you recognize me?”</t3739>
<t3740>“In this fog, my dear Basil?</t3740> <t3741>How could I, I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square.</t3741> <t3742>I believe my house is somewhere around here, but I'm not very sure about that.</t3742> <t3743>I'm sorry that you're going away, because I won't see you for a long time.</t3743> <t3744>But I suppose you'll be back soon, won't you?”</t3744>
<t3745>“No: I will be away from England for about six months.</t3745> <t3746>I plan to rent a studio in Paris and lock myself in until I finish the great painting that I have in mind.</t3746> <t3747>However, what I want to talk about is not myself.</t3747> <t3748>Here, we are at your door already.</t3748> <t3749>Let me in for a moment.</t3749> <t3750>I have something to tell you.”</t3750>
<t3751>"I am very happy."</t3751> <t3752>"But will you miss the train?" Dorian Gray said languidly, as he stepped up the stairs and opened the door with his latchkey.</t3752>
<t3753>The light pierced through the fog, and Hallward looked at his watch.</t3753> <t3754>“I have plenty of time,” he replied.</t3754> <t3755>“The train doesn't leave until twelve fifteen, and it's only eleven o'clock now.</t3755> <t3756>In fact, when I met you, I was on my way to the club to find you.</t3756> <t3757>You see, I won't be late because of the luggage, as I've already sent the heavy stuff ahead.</t3757> <t3758>Everything I'm carrying is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria Station in twenty minutes.</t3758><t3759>”</t3759>
<t3760>Dorian looked at him and laughed. "A polite artist traveling like this!</t3760> <t3761>A Gladstone bag, an ulster coat! Come in, or the fog will get into the house.</t3761> <t3762>And mind you, don't talk about anything serious.</t3762> <t3763>Nothing is serious these days.</t3763> <t3764>At least, nothing should be."</t3764>
<t3765>Hallward shook his head as he entered the house, then followed Dorian into the library.</t3765> <t3766>A brilliant wood fire was blazing fiercely in the large open fireplace.</t3766> <t3767>The lamps were lit, a silver Dutch liquor box stood open, along with some soda water siphons and large engraved glass cups, on the small inlaid table.</t3767>
<t3768>“You see, your servant makes me feel just like at home, Dorian.</t3768> <t3769>He gives me everything I need, including your finest gold-tipped cigarettes.</t3769> <t3770>He is a very hospitable creature.</t3770> <t3771>I like him much more than the Frenchman you used to have.</t3771> <t3772>By the way, what happened to that Frenchman?”</t3772>
<t3773>Dorian shrugged.</t3773> <t3774>“I suppose he married Mrs. Radley's maid and settled her in Paris as an English dressmaker. English fashion is very trendy over there now, I hear.</t3774> <t3775>The French seem rather silly, don't they? But — you know what? — he wasn't a bad servant at all.</t3775> <t3776>I never liked him, but I had no complaints about him either.</t3776> <t3777>People often imagine quite absurd things.</t3777> <t3778>He was really very devoted to me, and seemed quite sad when he had to leave.</t3778> <t3779>Would you like some more brandy and soda? Or do you prefer Rhine white wine and seltzer?</t3779> <t3780>I always drink Rhine white wine and seltzer myself.</t3780> <t3781>There should be some in the next room.</t3781><t3782>”</t3782>
<t3783>"Thank you, I won't drink anything more," the artist said, taking off his hat and coat, and throwing them onto the bag he had placed in the corner.</t3783> <t3784>"And now, dear friend, I want to have a serious talk with you.</t3784> <t3785>Don't frown like that.</t3785> <t3786>You've already made things much more difficult for me."</t3786>
<t3787>“So what does it have to do with?” Dorian exclaimed, in his usual impatient manner, and threw himself onto the sofa.</t3787> <t3788>“I hope it has nothing to do with me.</t3788> <t3789>I am tired of myself tonight.</t3789> <t3790>I wish I could become someone else.</t3790><t3791>”</t3791>
<t3792>"It concerns you," Hallward replied, in his warm, deliberate voice, "and I must tell you about it."</t3792> <t3793>"I will only keep you for about half an hour."</t3793>
<t3794>Dorian sighed, lighting a cigarette.</t3794> <t3795>"Half an hour!" he muttered.</t3795>
<t3796>"Asking you for this isn't much at all, Dorian, and I'm saying it entirely for your sake.</t3796> <t3797>I think you should know that there are some very frightening things being whispered about you in London.</t3797><t3798>"</t3798>
<t3799>“I don't want to know anything about them.</t3799> <t3800>I like scandals involving others, but I don't care about scandals involving me.</t3800> <t3801>They don't have the allure of novelty.”</t3801>
<t3802>“You must care about them, Dorian.</t3802> <t3803>Every gentleman cares about his reputation.</t3803> <t3804>You don't want people talking about you as if you were some vile and corrupt creature.</t3804> <t3805>Of course, you have position, wealth, and all that sort of thing.</t3805> <t3806>But position and wealth are not everything.</t3806> <t3807>Mind you, I don't believe these rumors at all.</t3807> <t3808>At least, I can't believe them when I see you.</t3808> <t3809>Sin writes itself across a man's face.</t3809> <t3810>It cannot be concealed.</t3810> <t3811>People sometimes talk about secret vices.</t3811> <t3812>There are no such things.</t3812> <t3813>If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids, even the shape of his hands.</t3813> <t3814>There was a man — I won't mention his name, but you know him — who came to me last year to have his portrait painted.</t3814> <t3815>I had never seen him before, and had not heard anything about him at the time, though I have heard a great deal since.</t3815> <t3816>He offered an exorbitant price.</t3816> <t3817>I refused him.</t3817> <t3818>There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated.</t3818> <t3819>Now I know that I was quite right in what I fancied about him.</t3819> <t3820>His life is dreadful.</t3820> <t3821>But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your marvelous untroubled youth — I can't believe anything against you.</t3821> <t3822>And yet I seldom see you, and you never come down to the studio anymore, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things that people whisper about you, I don't know what to say.</t3822> <t3823>Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room when you enter it?</t3823> <t3824>Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house nor invite you to theirs? You were a friend of Lord Staveley.</t3824> <t3825>I met him at dinner last week.</t3825> <t3826>Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at Dudley.</t3826> <t3827>Staveley curled his lip, and said that you might have the most artistic taste, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with.</t3827> <t3828>I reminded him that I was a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant.</t3828> <t3829>He told me.</t3829> <t3830>He told me right before everybody.</t3830> <t3831>It was horrible!</t3831> <t3832>Why is your friendship so fatal to young men?</t3832> <t3833>There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide.</t3833> <t3834>You were his great friend. Sir Henry Ashton had to leave England, with a tarnished name.</t3834> <t3835>You and he were inseparable.</t3835> <t3836>What about Adrian Singleton and his dreadful end?</t3836> <t3837>What about Lord Kent's only son and his career?</t3837> <t3838>I met his father yesterday in St. James's Street.</t3838> <t3839>He seemed broken with shame and sorrow.</t3839> <t3840>What about the young Duke of Perth?</t3840> <t3841>What sort of life is he leading now?</t3841> <t3842>Who is it that wants to associate with him anymore?”</t3842>
<t3843>"Stop it, Basil.</t3843> <t3844>You are talking about things you know nothing about," Dorian Gray said, biting his lip, with an infinite note of contempt in his voice.</t3844> <t3845>"You ask me why Berwick left the room when I entered.</t3845> <t3846>It is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows anything about mine.</t3846> <t3847>With the blood he has in his veins, how could his background be clean?</t3847> <t3848>You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did I teach one his vices and the other his depravity?</t3848> <t3849>If Kent's foolish son picked up his wife from the street, what does that have to do with me?</t3849> <t3850>If Adrian Singleton wrote his friend's name on a check, am I his guardian?</t3850> <t3851>I am well aware of how everyone gossips in England. The middle class expresses their moral prejudices over their greasy dinner tables, and gossip about what they call the debauchery of those above them to try to appear as if they belong to the upper class and have intimate relations with those they slander.</t3851> <t3852>In this country, all one needs is to be different and have a brain for every common tongue to lash out at them.</t3852> <t3853>And what kind of lives do those very people, who consider themselves moral, lead? My friend, you forget that we are in the homeland of hypocrisy."</t3853>
<t3854>“Dorian,” Hallward shouted, “that is not the issue.</t3854> <t3855>England is indeed quite bad, I know, and English society is all wrong.</t3855> <t3856>That is why I want you to be a noble person.</t3856> <t3857>You are not a noble person.</t3857> <t3858>One has the right to judge a person by the influence they exert on their friends.</t3858> <t3859>Your friends seem to have lost all sense of honor, of kindness, of purity.</t3859> <t3860>You have instilled in them a mad craving for pleasure.</t3860> <t3861>They have hit rock bottom.</t3861> <t3862>You have led them there.</t3862> <t3863>Yes: you have led them there, and you can still laugh, as you are laughing now.</t3863> <t3864>And there is something even more outrageous behind it.</t3864> <t3865>I know you and Harry are inseparable.</t3865> <t3866>Clearly for that reason, if for no other, you should not have made his sister's name a laughingstock.”</t3866>
<t3867>"Be careful, Basil."</t3867> <t3868>"You are going too far."</t3868>
<t3869>“I must speak, and you must listen.</t3869> <t3870>You will have to listen.</t3870> <t3871>When I met Miss Gwendolen, not a single breath of scandal had ever touched her.</t3871> <t3872>But now is there even one respectable woman in London who would still ride with her in the Park?</t3872> <t3873>Why, even her own children are not allowed to live with her.</t3873> <t3874>Then there are other stories — stories that you were seen sneaking out at dawn from dreadful houses and disguising yourself to slip into the filthiest slums in London.</t3874> <t3875>Are they true?</t3875> <t3876>Can they be true?</t3876> <t3877>When I first heard them, I laughed.</t3877> <t3878>Now I hear them, and they make me shudder.</t3878> <t3879>And what about your country house, and the life that is lived there?</t3879> <t3880>Dorian, you don’t know what people say about you.</t3880> <t3881>I won’t tell you that I don’t want to lecture you.</t3881> <t3882>I remember Harry once said that everyone who turns themselves into an amateur priest for a moment always begins by saying that, and then breaks their promise.</t3882> <t3883>I do want to lecture you.</t3883> <t3884>I want you to live a life that makes the world respect you.</t3884> <t3885>I want you to have a clean name and a fair record.</t3885> <t3886>I want you to get rid of those dreadful people you are associating with.</t3886> <t3887>Don’t shrug like that.</t3887> <t3888>Don’t be so indifferent.</t3888> <t3889>You have a wonderful influence.</t3889> <t3890>Let it be for good, not for evil.</t3890> <t3891>They say you corrupt everyone you become intimate with, and that just your entering a house is enough to bring some shame in your wake.</t3891> <t3892>I don’t know if it’s true or not.</t3892> <t3893>How could I know?</t3893> <t3894>But that is what is said about you.</t3894> <t3895>I have been told things that seem impossible to doubt.</t3895> <t3896>Lord Gloucester was one of my closest friends at Oxford.</t3896> <t3897>He showed me the letter his wife wrote to him when she was dying alone at their villa in Mentone.</t3897> <t3898>Your name was mentioned in the most terrible confession I have ever read.</t3898> <t3899>I told him it was absurd — that I knew you well, and that you couldn’t have done anything of that kind.</t3899> <t3900>Know you? I wonder if I really know you?</t3900> <t3901>Before I can answer that, perhaps I need to see your soul.”</t3901>
<t3902>"See my soul!" Dorian Gray muttered, standing up abruptly from the sofa and almost turning pale with fear.</t3902>
<t3903>“Yes,” Hallward replied, solemnly, and with a deep sadness in his tone — “to see your soul.</t3903> <t3904>But only God can do that.”</t3904>
<t3905>A bitter, mocking laugh escaped from the younger person's lips.</t3905> <t3906>"You will see it with your own eyes, tonight!" he shouted, grabbing a lamp on the table.</t3906> <t3907>"Go: it is something made by your own hands.</t3907> <t3908>Why shouldn't you look at it?</t3908> <t3909>Then you can tell the world all about it, if you decide to.</t3909> <t3910>Nobody will believe you.</t3910> <t3911>If they do believe you, they will like me more because of it.</t3911> <t3912>I understand this era better than you do, even though you will boast about it in the most boring way.</t3912> <t3913>Go, I tell you.</t3913> <t3914>You have prattled enough about decay already.</t3914> <t3915>Now you will see it face to face."</t3915>
<t3916>There is a mad pride in every word you utter.</t3916> <t3917>You stomp your foot on the floor with a childish insolence.</t3917> <t3918>You feel a terrible joy at the thought that there is someone else to share your secret, and that the person who painted the portrait, which is the source of all your shame, will have to bear the dreadful memory of what he has done for the rest of his life.</t3918>
<t3919>"Yes," he continued, approaching him, not taking his eyes off his stern gaze, "I will show you my soul."</t3919> <t3920>"You will see what you thought only God could see."</t3920>
<t3921>Hallward started back with a look of horror. "Blasphemy, Dorian!" he cried. "You must not say such things.</t3921> <t3922>They are horrible, and they mean nothing at all.</t3922><t3923>"</t3923>
<t3924>"Do you think so?" He smiled again.</t3924>
<t3925>“I know that.</t3925> <t3926>As for what I told you tonight, I said it because I want the best for you.</t3926> <t3927>You know I have always been a loyal friend to you.”</t3927>
<t3928>"Don't touch me.</t3928> <t3929>Say whatever you have to say."</t3929>
<t3930>A fleeting grimace of pain flashed across the artist's face.</t3930> <t3931>He paused for a moment, and a fierce feeling of pity came over him.</t3931> <t3932>After all, what right did he have to pry into Dorian Gray's life? Even if the young man had done a fraction of what people gossiped about, he must have suffered immensely! Then he straightened up, walked over to the fireplace, stood there, watching the burning logs with frost-like ashes and the glowing embers.</t3932>
<t3933>“I am waiting here, Basil,” the young man said, in a clear, firm voice.</t3933>
<t3934>He turned back.</t3934> <t3935>"What I have to say is this," he shouted. "You must give me some answer to these terrible accusations that have been made against you.</t3935> <t3936>If you tell me that they are absolutely false from beginning to end, I will believe you.</t3936> <t3937>Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can't you see what I have to go through?</t3937> <t3938>Good God! Don't tell me that you are wicked, depraved, and dishonorable."</t3938>
<t3939>Dorian Gray laughed.</t3939> <t3940>There was a contemptuous curl on his lips. "Come upstairs, Basil," he said calmly.</t3940> <t3941>"I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written.</t3941> <t3942>I will show it to you if you come with me."</t3942>
<t3943>“I will go with you, Dorian, if you want that.</t3943> <t3944>I see that I have missed the train.</t3944> <t3945>That’s alright.</t3945> <t3946>I can go tomorrow.</t3946> <t3947>But don’t ask me to read anything tonight.</t3947> <t3948>All I want is a straightforward answer to my question.”</t3948>
<t3949>“It will be given to you upstairs.</t3949> <t3950>I can't bring it out here.</t3950> <t3951>You won't have to read for long.”</t3951>
<t3952>Chapter 13</t3952>
<t3953>He left the room and began to go upstairs, with Basil Hallward following closely behind.</t3953> <t3954>They walked quietly, as people instinctively do at night.</t3954> <t3955>The lights cast strange shadows on the walls and stairs.</t3955> <t3956>A gust of wind arose, causing a few windows to rattle.</t3956>
<t3957>When they reached the top of the highest staircase.</t3957> <t3958>Dorian put the lamp down on the floor, took out a key, and turned it in the lock.</t3958> <t3959>“You really insist on knowing, don't you Basil?” he asked, in a gentle voice.</t3959>
<t3960>“Correct.”</t3960>
<t3961>“I am very honored,” he replied, smiling.</t3961> <t3962>Then he added, somewhat bitterly, “you are the only person in the world who has the right to know everything about me.</t3962> <t3963>You have been more involved in my life than you think,” and, picking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in.</t3963> <t3964>A cold draft passed through them, the light flared for a moment in the dim orange flame.</t3964> <t3965>He shivered. “Close the door behind you,” he whispered, and placed the lamp on the table.</t3965>
<t3966>Hallward looked around him, with a bewildered expression.</t3966> <t3967>The room looked as if it hadn't been inhabited for many years.</t3967> <t3968>A faded Flanders carpet, a veiled painting, an old Italian cassone, and an almost empty bookshelf — that seemed to be all it contained, apart from a chair and a table.</t3968> <t3969>When Dorian Gray relit a half-burned candle on the mantelpiece, he saw that the entire place was covered in dust, and the carpet was riddled with holes. A rat scurried behind the wainscoting.</t3969> <t3970>The smell of damp mold lingered in the air.</t3970>
<t3971>“So you think that only God can see the soul, right Basil? Pull this curtain aside, and you will see my soul.”</t3971>
<t3972>That voice was cold and cruel. "You're mad, Dorian, or you're playing a part," Hallward whispered, grimacing.</t3972>
<t3973>“You won't do it?</t3973> <t3974>Then I'll have to do it myself,” the young person said, yanking the curtain off the bar and throwing it onto the floor.</t3974>
<t3975>A horrifying scream burst from the artist's lips when he saw the grotesque face on the canvas grinning at him in the dim light.</t3975> <t3976>There was something about its expression that made him feel utterly disgusted and hateful.</t3976> <t3977>My God! It was the face of Dorian Gray himself, he was looking at the face of Dorian Gray himself! The horror had not yet completely ruined that extraordinary beauty.</t3977> <t3978>There was still some golden hue in the thinning hair and some pink on the sensual lips.</t3978> <t3979>The dull eyes still retained some charm in their blue, the noble curves had not entirely vanished from the sculpted nostrils and the chiseled throat.</t3979> <t3980>Yes, it was Dorian.</t3980> <t3981>But who had created it?</t3981> <t3982>He seemed to recognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design.</t3982> <t3983>The thought was bizarre, yet it frightened him.</t3983> <t3984>He grabbed the lit candle and brought it closer to the painting.</t3984> <t3985>In the lower left corner was his name, sketched in long, fresh red letters.</t3985>
<t3986>It was some terrible imitation, a vile, despicable parody.</t3986> <t3987>He had never created such a thing.</t3987> <t3988>Yet, it was still his painting.</t3988> <t3989>He knew it, and he felt as if his blood had changed in an instant from fire to sluggish ice water.</t3989> <t3990>His very own painting!</t3990> <t3991>What did that mean?</t3991> <t3992>How had it transformed?</t3992> <t3993>He turned back, looking at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.</t3993> <t3994>His mouth twitched, his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate clearly.</t3994> <t3995>He passed his hand across his forehead.</t3995> <t3996>It was clammy with cold sweat.</t3996>
<t3997>The young man leaned against the mantelpiece, observing him with the strange expression one often sees on the faces of those who are captivated by a play when some great artist performs.</t3997> <t3998>There was no real sorrow and no real joy on it.</t3998> <t3999>Only the fascination of a spectator, with perhaps a shimmering glint of triumph in his eyes.</t3999> <t4000>He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so.</t4000>
<t4001>“What does this mean?” Hallward finally exclaimed.</t4001> <t4002>His voice sounded strangely shrill in his own ears.</t4002>
<t4003>“Many years ago, when I was just a boy,” Dorian Gray said, crushing the flower in his hand, “you met me, flattered me, taught me to be proud of my beauty.</t4003> <t4004>One day, you introduced me to a friend of yours, and he explained to me the wonders of youth, while you completed the portrait of me, a painting that revealed to me the marvel of beauty.</t4004> <t4005>In a moment of madness, which, even now, I do not know if I regret, I uttered a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer…”</t4005>
<t4006>"I remember it now!"</t4006> <t4007>"Oh, I remember it so clearly! No! This cannot happen."</t4007> <t4008>"The room is damp."</t4008> <t4009>"Mold is spreading on the canvas."</t4009> <t4010>"The paints I used had some harmful minerals in them."</t4010> <t4011>"I assure you that this cannot happen."</t4011>
<t4012>“Well, what can't happen?” the young person muttered, approaching the window and resting their forehead on the cold, mist-covered glass.</t4012>
<t4013>“You told me that you had destroyed it.</t4013><t4014>”</t4014>
<t4015>“I was wrong.</t4015> <t4016>It destroyed me.”</t4016>
<t4017>“I don't believe it is my painting.”</t4017>
<t4018>“Don’t you see your ideal in it?” Dorian said, bitterly.</t4018>
<t4019>“My ideal, as you call it…”</t4019>
<t4020>“As you call it.”</t4020>
<t4021>“There is nothing evil in it, nothing shameful.</t4021> <t4022>To me, you are like an ideal that I will never encounter again.</t4022> <t4023>And this is the face of the god of lust.”</t4023>
<t4024>“That is the face of my soul.”</t4024>
<t4025>"Oh God! And to think I have been venerating something like this!"</t4025> <t4026>"It has the eyes of a demon."</t4026>
<t4027>"Each of us has Heaven and Hell within us, Basil," Dorian exclaimed, with a gesture of wild despair.</t4027>
<t4028>Hallward turned back to the portrait and stared at it. "Good God! If it is true," he cried, "and this is what you have done with your life, why, then you must be worse than what people whisper about you!" He took the candle closer to the canvas and examined it.</t4028> <t4029>The surface seemed completely unchanged, exactly as he had left it.</t4029> <t4030>It seemed that the hideous horror came from within.</t4030> <t4031>Through some strange inner life force, the leprosy of sin had slowly eaten away at this thing.</t4031> <t4032>The decay of a corpse in a watery grave was not as dreadful as this.</t4032>
<t4033>With a swift motion, the candle fell from its holder to the floor, lying there with a sizzle.</t4033> <t4034>He stepped on it and extinguished it.</t4034> <t4035>Then he let himself fall into the wobbly chair next to the table and buried his face in his hands.</t4035>
<t4036>"Good Lord, Dorian, what a dreadful lesson! What a terrible lesson!" There was no answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing by the window. "Pray, Dorian, pray," he murmured.</t4036> <t4037>"What was that phrase we were taught to say as children? 'Lead us not into temptation.</t4037> <t4038>Forgive us our sins.</t4038> <t4039>Cleanse us of our vices.'</t4039> <t4040>Let us say it together.</t4040> <t4041>Your prayer of self-respect will be answered.</t4041> <t4042>Your prayer of repentance will also be answered.</t4042> <t4043>I worshipped you too much.</t4043> <t4044>I am punished for that.</t4044> <t4045>You also worshipped yourself too much.</t4045> <t4046>We are both punished."</t4046>
<t4047>Dorian Gray slowly turned around, looking at him with tear-filled eyes.</t4047> <t4048>"It's too late, Basil," he stammered.</t4048>
<t4049>“It is never too late, Dorian.</t4049> <t4050>Let us kneel down and try even if we cannot remember the prayer.</t4050> <t4051>There is a verse, isn’t there, ‘Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow’?”</t4051>
<t4052>“Those words have no meaning to me at this moment.”</t4052>
<t4053>"Shh! Don't say that. You've already done enough bad things in your life."</t4053> <t4054>"Oh God! Do you see that cursed thing giving me a dirty look?"</t4054>
<t4055>Dorian Gray glanced at the painting, and suddenly an uncontrollable hatred for Basil overwhelmed him, as if it was evoked by the image on the canvas, whispered into his ear by those sneering lips.</t4055> <t4056>The frenzied rage of a hunted animal rose within him, and he hated the man sitting by the table more than he had ever hated anything in his entire life.</t4056> <t4057>He looked around frantically.</t4057> <t4058>There was something faintly gleaming on top of the painted chest in front of him.</t4058> <t4059>His eyes caught sight of it.</t4059> <t4060>He knew what it was.</t4060> <t4061>It was the knife he had brought up a few days ago to cut a piece of string and had forgotten to take with him.</t4061> <t4062>He slowly edged towards it, passing by Hallward as he did so.</t4062> <t4063>As soon as he was behind him, he grabbed it and turned around.</t4063> <t4064>Hallward stirred in his chair as if he was about to stand up.</t4064> <t4065>He rushed at him, stabbing the large artery behind his ear, pressing the man's head down on the table, stabbing again and again.</t4065>
<t4066>A choking moan, and the terrible sound of someone suffocating on their own blood.</t4066> <t4067>Three times in a row, those outstretched arms tried to jerk up, waving those bizarre hands with stiff fingers in the air.</t4067> <t4068>He stabbed him two more times, but the person no longer moved.</t4068> <t4069>Something began to drip onto the floor.</t4069> <t4070>He waited a moment, still pressing the head down.</t4070> <t4071>Then he threw the knife onto the table, listening.</t4071>
<t4072>You can't hear anything except the dripping sound, dripping onto the worn-out carpet.</t4072> <t4073>You open the door and step out onto the landing.</t4073> <t4074>The house is as silent as a sheet.</t4074> <t4075>Not a single person around.</t4075> <t4076>You stand for a few seconds, leaning over the railing, staring down into the boiling black well of darkness.</t4076> <t4077>Then you take out the key and return to the room, locking yourself inside.</t4077>
<t4078>That person was still sitting on the chair, stretching across the table with their head bowed, hunchbacked, and with grotesquely long arms.</t4078> <t4079>If it weren't for the jagged red tear on their neck and the thick black puddle slowly spreading across the table, one might say that they were just sleeping.</t4079>
<t4080>Everything was done so quickly! He felt strangely calm, and, approaching the window, opened it, and stepped out onto the balcony.</t4080> <t4081>The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a giant peacock tail, dotted with countless golden eyes.</t4081> <t4082>He looked down and saw a patrolling policeman casting a long beam of light from his lantern onto the doors of the silent houses.</t4082> <t4083>The red dot of a two-wheeled carriage wandered around, flickering at the corner of the street, then disappeared.</t4083> <t4084>A woman wrapped in a fluttering shawl was stealthily walking beside the fence, staggering as she stepped.</t4084> <t4085>Occasionally, she stopped and looked back.</t4085> <t4086>Once, she began to sing in a hoarse voice.</t4086> <t4087>The policeman leisurely approached and said something to her.</t4087> <t4088>She staggered away, laughing.</t4088> <t4089>A cold gust of wind swept across the square.</t4089> <t4090>The gas lamps flickered, turned blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches back and forth.</t4090> <t4091>He shivered and turned back, closing the window behind him.</t4091>
<t4092>Reaching the door, he turned the key and opened it.</t4092> <t4093>He didn't even glance at the person who had been killed.</t4093> <t4094>He felt that the secret to the whole affair was not being aware of the situation.</t4094> <t4095>The friend who had painted the disastrous portrait, which was the cause of all his suffering, had vanished from his life.</t4095> <t4096>That was enough.</t4096>
<t4097>Then he remembered the lamp.</t4097> <t4098>It was a rather strange object from Moroccan craftsmanship, made of tarnished silver inlaid with polished steel Arabic motifs, studded with raw turquoise.</t4098> <t4099>Perhaps his servant might remember it again and would ask about it.</t4099> <t4100>He hesitated for a moment, then turned back and took it from the table.</t4100> <t4101>He couldn't help but look at that dead thing.</t4101> <t4102>How silent it was!</t4102> <t4103>How terribly white those long hands looked.</t4103> <t4104>It was like a dreadful wax figure.</t4104>
<t4105>After locking the door behind him, he quietly sneaked down the stairs.</t4105> <t4106>The wooden item creaked, and seemed to cry out as if in pain.</t4106> <t4107>He stopped a few times, waiting.</t4107> <t4108>No: everything was quiet.</t4108> <t4109>It was just his footsteps.</t4109>
<t4110>When he returned to the library, he saw the bag and the coat in the corner.</t4110> <t4111>They had to be hidden somewhere.</t4111> <t4112>He opened the secret closet in the baseboard paneling, a closet where he kept his strange disguises, and put it inside.</t4112> <t4113>He could easily burn them later.</t4113> <t4114>Then he pulled out the watch.</t4114> <t4115>It was twenty to two.</t4115>
<t4116>You sat down and began to think.</t4116> <t4117>Every year — almost every month — many people are hanged in England for what they have done.</t4117> <t4118>The madness of murder is in the air.</t4118> <t4119>Some red star has come too close to the earth...</t4119> <t4120>However, what evidence is there against you? Basil Hallward had left your house at eleven o'clock.</t4120> <t4121>No one saw him come back.</t4121> <t4122>Most of the servants are at Selby Royal.</t4122> <t4123>Your valet had gone to bed... Paris! That's right.</t4123> <t4124>Paris is where Basil went, by the midnight train, as he had planned.</t4124> <t4125>With his strange, cautious habits, it would be many months before any suspicion arose.</t4125> <t4126>Months!</t4126> <t4127>Everything could be destroyed long before then.</t4127>
<t4128>An unexpected thought flashed through his mind.</t4128> <t4129>He put on his fur coat and hat, then went out to the hall.</t4129> <t4130>He stopped there, listening to the slow and heavy footsteps of the policeman on the sidewalk outside, and saw the light from the bull's-eye lantern reflecting on the window.</t4130> <t4131>He waited, holding his breath.</t4131>
<t4132>Moments later, he pulled the latch, slipped outside, and closed the door very quietly behind him.</t4132> <t4133>Then he began to ring the bell.</t4133> <t4134>About five minutes later, his servant appeared, half-dressed, looking very sleepy.</t4134>
<t4135>“I'm sorry for having to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping into the house; “but I forgot the key.</t4135> <t4136>What time is it?”</t4136>
<t4137>“Ten minutes to two, sir,” the servant replied, looking at the clock and blinking.</t4137>
<t4138>"Ten minutes to two? </t4138><t4139>Why is it so late already! You should have woken me up at nine in the morning.</t4139><t4140>I have some things to do.</t4140><t4141>"</t4141>
<t4142>"Yes, sir."</t4142>
<t4143>"Is anyone coming over tonight?"</t4143>
<t4144>"There is Mr. Hallward, sir.</t4144> <t4145>He stayed here until eleven o'clock, then he left to catch the train."</t4145>
<t4146>"Oh! I'm sorry I didn't get to meet him."</t4146> <t4147>"Did he leave any message?"</t4147>
<t4148>"No, sir, except that he will write to you from Paris if he does not find you at the club."</t4148>
<t4149>"Alright, Francis.</t4149> <t4150>Don't forget to call me at nine in the morning.</t4150><t4151>"</t4151>
<t4152>“Yes, sir.”</t4152>
<t4153>The servant shuffled along the hallway in slippers.</t4153> <t4154>Dorian Gray threw his hat and coat onto the table, then went into the library.</t4154> <t4155>For a quarter of an hour, he paced back and forth in the room, biting his lip, thinking.</t4155> <t4156>Then he took the Blue Book down from one of the shelves and began flipping through the pages.</t4156> <t4157>"Alan Campbell, 152 Hertford Street, Mayfair." Yes; that was the person he needed.</t4157>
<t4158>Chapter 14</t4158>
<t4159>At 9 o'clock in the morning, his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.</t4159> <t4160>Dorian was sleeping very soundly, lying on his right side, with one hand under his cheek.</t4160> <t4161>He looked like a little boy exhausted from playing too much or studying hard.</t4161>
<t4162>The servant had to touch his shoulder twice before he woke up, and when he opened his eyes, a shy smile flickered across his lips, as if he had just been lost in some delightful dream.</t4162> <t4163>However, he absolutely did not dream of anything.</t4163> <t4164>His night was not disturbed by any joyful or painful images.</t4164> <t4165>But youth can smile without any reason.</t4165> <t4166>That is one of its main charms.</t4166>
<t4167>He turned around, and, leaning on his elbow, began to nibble on chocolate.</t4167> <t4168>The sweet November sunlight poured into the room.</t4168> <t4169>The sky was bright, and there was a pleasant warmth in the air.</t4169> <t4170>It felt like a morning in May.</t4170>
<t4171>Slowly, the events of the previous night stealthily crept with blood-stained steps into his brain, and replayed there with terrible clarity.</t4171> <t4172>He recoiled at the memory of everything he had endured, and for a moment, that same strange hatred for Basil Hallward that had driven him to murder while he sat in the chair returned to him, chilling him with anger.</t4172> <t4173>The dead man was still sitting there, now in the sunlight.</t4173> <t4174>How horrifying that was!</t4174> <t4175>Such ghastly things are meant for the dark, not for the daylight.</t4175>
<t4176>You find that if you keep brooding over what you have gone through, you will fall ill or go mad.</t4176> <t4177>There are sins whose allure lies more in the memory than in the act; strange victories that satisfy pride more than passion, and give the intellect a lively, intense joy greater than any pleasure it brings, or could ever bring, to the senses.</t4177> <t4178>But this was not one of them.</t4178> <t4179>It is something to be driven out of the soul, drugged with opium, strangled so that it cannot strangle itself.</t4179>
<t4180>When the clock struck the half-hour, he wiped his hand across his forehead, then hurriedly stood up, dressed himself with more care than usual, paid much attention to choosing a tie with a pin for his scarf, and changed rings more than once.</t4180> <t4181>He also spent a lot of time on breakfast, tasting different dishes, talking to the servants about some new uniforms he was thinking of having made for the staff at Selby, and then went through the correspondence.</t4181> <t4182>He smiled at a few letters.</t4182> <t4183>Three of them bothered him.</t4183> <t4184>One letter he read several times and tore up with a slightly annoyed look on his face.</t4184> <t4185>“That terrible thing, a woman's memory!” as Lord Henry once said.</t4185>
<t4186>After finishing his black coffee, he leisurely wiped his mouth with a napkin, signaled for the servant to wait, and went to the table to write two letters.</t4186> <t4187>He put one letter in his pocket and gave the other to the servant.</t4187>
<t4188>"Take this to house number 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his address."</t4188>
<t4189>As soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching on a piece of paper, first drawing flowers, then structural patterns, and then faces.</t4189> <t4190>Suddenly, he noticed that every face he drew seemed to bear a strange resemblance to Basil Hallward.</t4190> <t4191>He frowned, stood up, went to the bookshelf, and randomly took out a book.</t4191> <t4192>He decided that he would not think about what had happened until it was absolutely necessary to do so.</t4192>
<t4193>As he stretched out on the sofa, he looked at the title page of the book.</t4193> <t4194>It was the book Émaux et Camées, by Gautier, the Japanese paper edition by Charpentier, with acid engravings by Jacquemart.</t4194> <t4195>The cover was of lemon-green leather, with a gold lattice pattern and speckled pomegranates.</t4195> <t4196>Adrian Singleton had given it to him.</t4196> <t4197>As he turned the page, his eyes noticed the poem about Lacenaire's hand, the cold golden hand “du supplice encore mal lavée1," with red down and "doigts de faune2.”</t4197> <t4198>He glanced at his own slender white fingers, shuddered involuntarily, and read on, until he came to those lovely stanzas about Venice:</t4198>
<t4199>"On a chromatic scale,</t4199>
<t4200>The breast of pearls glistening,</t4200>
<t4201>The Venus of the Adriatic</t4201>
<t4202>Her pink and white body emerges from the water.</t4202>
<t4203>"The domes, on the azure of the waves</t4203>
<t4204>Following the sentence with a pure outline,</t4204>
<t4205>Swell like round throats</t4205>
<t4206>That raises a sigh of love.</t4206>
<t4207>"The skiff lands and drops me off,</t4207>
<t4208>Throwing its mooring to the pillar,</t4208>
<t4209>In front of a pink façade,</t4209>
<t4210>On the marble of a staircase."3</t4210>
<t4211>1 Just washed away the disgust.</t4211>
<t4212>2 The fingers of the prodigy.</t4212>
<t4213>3 Breasts covered in pearls / A person sweet and fragrant / Adriatic Venus rises / On the waves of the strait / The arches of the waves / Chasing after the music / To the rhythm of the waves / Like the chest of love sighing / Throwing chains around the anchor post / I dock at the market / The rosy facade finally / On the marble steps.</t4213>
<t4214>How wonderful they are!</t4214> <t4215>When I read them, I seem to drift along the green canals of a pink pearl city, sitting in a black boat with a silver prow and a trailing canopy.</t4215> <t4216>Just the lines of poetry alone, to you, seem like turquoise streaks following me as I speed towards Lido.</t4216> <t4217>The sudden flashes of color remind you of the flickering light of the cat-eyed, emerald-throated, and multi-colored birds fluttering around the towering, honeycomb-like Bell Tower, or gracefully soaring, with an air of majestic elegance, through the dark, dusty arches.</t4217> <t4218>Leaning back, eyes half-closed, you keep talking to yourself endlessly:</t4218>
<t4219>"In front of a pink facade,</t4219>
<t4220>On the marble of a staircase."</t4220>
<t4221>All of Venice in these two lines of poetry.</t4221> <t4222>You remember the autumn you spent here, and a wonderful romance that inspired you to do crazy, delightful things.</t4222> <t4223>Romance is everywhere.</t4223> <t4224>But Venice, like Oxford, provides the backdrop for romance, and with true romance, the backdrop is everything, or nearly everything.</t4224> <t4225>Basil was with you for part of that time, very excited about Tintoret.</t4225> <t4226>Poor Basil! What a tragic death!</t4226>
<t4227>He sighed, picked up the book again, and tried to forget.</t4227> <t4228>He read about the swallows flying in and out of a small café in Smyrna where the Hadjis sat counting amber beads while the turbaned merchants smoked long tasseled pipes and solemnly conversed with each other; he read about the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde, weeping granite tears in its gloomy, lonely exile, longing to return to the hot Nile covered with lotus flowers, where there were Sphinx statues, red-pink ibises, white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles, with tiny berin eyes, crawling through the green steaming mud; he began to ponder the verses that, drawing music from the marble kissed by a kiss, spoke of the strange statue that Gautier had compared to a contralto voice, “monstre charmant” still lying in the porphyry room at the Louvre.</t4228> <t4229>But after a while, the book fell from his hands.</t4229> <t4230>He became restless, a terrible fear overwhelmed him.</t4230> <t4231>What if Alan Campbell had left England? Many days would pass before he could return.</t4231> <t4232>He might even refuse to come.</t4232> <t4233>Then what would he do? Every moment was of critical importance.</t4233> <t4234>They had been close friends, five years ago — almost inseparable, really.</t4234> <t4235>Then the closeness had suddenly come to an end.</t4235> <t4236>Now when they met in high society, only Dorian Gray smiled; Alan Campbell never did.</t4236>
<t4237>A Muslim pilgrim once journeyed to the holy city of Mecca</t4237>
<t4238>He was an extremely intelligent young man, although he did not truly appreciate the tangible arts, and any ability to perceive the beauty of poetry that he possessed was entirely absorbed from Dorian.</t4238> <t4239>His predominant intellectual passion was for science.</t4239> <t4240>At Cambridge, he spent a lot of time working in the laboratory, achieving high marks in the annual examination for outstanding natural science students.</t4240> <t4241>Indeed, he remained devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a private laboratory where he often secluded himself all day long, much to the distress of his mother, who earnestly wished for him to have a position in Parliament, and had a vague notion that a chemist was someone who wrote prescriptions.</t4241> <t4242>However, he was also an excellent musician and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.</t4242> <t4243>In fact, it was music that first brought him and Dorian Gray together — music and the indefinable charm that Dorian seemed able to wield whenever he wished, and indeed did so frequently and unconsciously.</t4243> <t4244>They met at Mrs. Berkshire's on the night Rubinstein performed there, and subsequently often encountered each other at the opera house, and anywhere there was good music.</t4244> <t4245>Their closeness lasted eighteen months.</t4245> <t4246>Campbell was always at Selby Royal or Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian Gray was the epitome of all that was wonderful and enchanting in life.</t4246> <t4247>Whether any quarrel had occurred between them, no one ever knew.</t4247> <t4248>But suddenly people noticed that they hardly spoke to each other when they met, and that Campbell seemed always to leave early from any party where Dorian Gray was present.</t4248> <t4249>He also changed — sometimes becoming strangely melancholic, appearing almost to hate music, never playing himself, and apologizing when invited to do so, saying that he was so engrossed in science that he had no time to practice.</t4249> <t4250>And this was probably true.</t4250> <t4251>With each passing day, he seemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared a few times in various scientific journals, related to some peculiar experiments.</t4251>
<t4252>That is the person whom Dorian Gray is waiting for. He keeps looking at the clock every second.</t4252> <t4253>As the minutes pass, he becomes terribly anxious.</t4253> <t4254>Finally, he stands up and begins to pace back and forth in the room, looking like a beautiful beast trapped in a cage.</t4254> <t4255>He takes long, stealthy strides.</t4255> <t4256>His hands are strangely cold.</t4256>
<t4257>The state of waiting became unbearable.</t4257> <t4258>He felt time dragging its leaden feet, while he was swept by monstrous gusts towards the jagged edge of some black fissure on the cliff face.</t4258> <t4259>He knew what was waiting for him there; saw it truly, and, shuddering, pressed his damp hands to his burning eyelids as if he could steal his vision, pushing his eyeballs back into their sockets.</t4259> <t4260>In vain.</t4260> <t4261>The brain has its own nutrients that it still feeds on, and the imagination, twisted by fear, writhed and contorted like a pained creature, dancing like some ugly puppet on a stage, grinning through its twitching mask.</t4261> <t4262>Then, suddenly, Time stopped for him.</t4262> <t4263>Yes: that blind, slow-breathing thing no longer crawled, and the terrible thoughts, with Time paralyzed, raced ahead, dragging a ghastly future out of its grave, showing it to him.</t4263> <t4264>He stared at it.</t4264> <t4265>Its very horror turned him to stone.</t4265>
<t4266>Finally, the door opened, and his servant stepped in.</t4266> <t4267>He looked at him with glazed eyes.</t4267>
<t4268>“Mr. Campbell has arrived, sir,” the person said.</t4268>
<t4269>A sigh of relief escaped from his parched lips, and color returned to his cheeks.</t4269>
<t4270>"Please let him in immediately, Francis." He felt like himself again.</t4270> <t4271>His cowardly mood had vanished.</t4271>
<t4272>The servant bowed his head and withdrew.</t4272> <t4273>A moment later, Alan Campbell walked in, looking very stern and quite pale, his pallor further accentuated by his coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.</t4273>
<t4274>“Alan! You are so kind.</t4274> <t4275>Thank you for coming.</t4275><t4276>”</t4276>
<t4277>“I had decided never to step into your house again, Gray.</t4277> <t4278>But you said this was a matter of life and death.” His voice was harsh and cold.</t4278> <t4279>He spoke slowly.</t4279> <t4280>A look of contempt in the calm scrutinizing gaze he cast at Dorian.</t4280> <t4281>He kept his hands in the pockets of his karakul wool coat, and seemed indifferent to the gesture with which he was greeted.</t4281>
<t4282>“Correct: this is a matter of life and death, Alan, and for more than one individual.</t4282> <t4283>Please have a seat.”</t4283>
<t4284>Campbell took the seat next to the table, while Dorian sat opposite him.</t4284> <t4285>Their eyes met.</t4285> <t4286>There was boundless affection in Dorian's eyes.</t4286> <t4287>He knew that what he was about to do was very frightening.</t4287>
<t4288>After a moment of tense silence, he leaned over and said, very calmly, but carefully observing the impact of each word he conveyed on his face, "Alan, in a locked room on the top floor of this building, a room that no one but me has the right to enter, there is a dead man sitting at the table.</t4288> <t4289>He has been dead for about ten hours.</t4289> <t4290>Don't move, and don't look at me like that.</t4290> <t4291>Who that person is, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern you.</t4291> <t4292>What you need to do is this…”</t4292>
<t4293>“Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything more.</t4293> <t4294>Whether what you tell me is true or not, it doesn't concern me.</t4294> <t4295>I completely refuse to be involved in your life.</t4295> <t4296>Keep your terrible secrets to yourself.</t4296> <t4297>I don't care about them anymore.”</t4297>
<t4298>“Alan, you will have to take care of them.</t4298> <t4299>You will have to take care of this one thing.</t4299> <t4300>I am very sorry for you, Alan.</t4300> <t4301>But I cannot help myself.</t4301> <t4302>You are the only one who can save me.</t4302> <t4303>I am forced to drag you into this.</t4303> <t4304>I have no choice.</t4304> <t4305>Alan, you are a scientist.</t4305> <t4306>You know about chemistry, and things of that sort.</t4306> <t4307>You conduct experiments.</t4307> <t4308>What you have to do is destroy the thing in the attic — destroy it so that not a trace of it remains.</t4308> <t4309>No one saw this person enter the house.</t4309> <t4310>Indeed, everyone thinks he is currently in Paris. He will not be remembered for many months.</t4310> <t4311>We must make sure that when people do remember him, they cannot find anything of him here.</t4311> <t4312>You, Alan, you must turn him, and everything of his, into a handful of ashes that I can scatter into the air.”</t4312>
<t4313>“You are crazy, Dorian.”</t4313>
<t4314>"Wow! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.</t4314><t4315>"</t4315>
<t4316>“You’re crazy, I’m telling you — crazy for thinking I would lift even a finger to help you, crazy for uttering this horrendous confession.</t4316> <t4317>I will have nothing to do with this, whatever it is.</t4317> <t4318>Do you think I would risk my reputation for you?</t4318> <t4319>Whatever devilish thing you’re doing, what does it have to do with me?”</t4319>
<t4320>“It was a suicide, Alan.”</t4320>
<t4321>“I am very happy with that.</t4321> <t4322>But who pushed him to do that?</t4322> <t4323>You, I suppose.”</t4323>
<t4324>“Are you still refusing to do this for me?”</t4324>
<t4325>“Of course I refuse.</t4325> <t4326>I will absolutely have nothing to do with it.</t4326> <t4327>I don't care what disgrace will come to you.</t4327> <t4328>You completely deserve it.</t4328> <t4329>I will not be saddened to see you being abandoned, being publicly abandoned.</t4329> <t4330>How dare you ask me, among so many people in the world, to get involved in this horrendous affair?</t4330> <t4331>I thought you understood more about human nature.</t4331> <t4332>Lord Henry Wotton, your friend, cannot teach you much about psychology, even though he has taught you many other things.</t4332> <t4333>Nothing could compel me to take a step to help you.</t4333>
<t4334>You have come to the wrong person.</t4334> <t4335>Go to someone else among your friends.</t4335> <t4336>Do not come to see me.</t4336>
<t4337>“Alan, that's murder.</t4337> <t4338>I killed him.</t4338> <t4339>You don't know what he made me endure.</t4339> <t4340>No matter how my life turned out, he was more involved in creating or ruining it than poor Harry ever was.</t4340> <t4341>He may not have intended it, but the result is the same.”</t4341>
<t4342>“Murder! Good Lord, Dorian, have you gone this far?</t4342> <t4343>I will not turn you in.</t4343> <t4344>That is not my business.</t4344> <t4345>Besides, even if I do nothing in this matter, you will surely be caught.</t4345> <t4346>No one has ever committed a crime without doing something foolish afterward.</t4346> <t4347>But I will not get involved in it.”</t4347>
<t4348>“You have to get involved in it to some extent.</t4348> <t4349>Wait, wait a moment; listen to me.</t4349> <t4350>Just listen, Alan.</t4350> <t4351>All I ask of you is to conduct some scientific experiment.</t4351> <t4352>You go to the hospital and the morgue, and the gruesome things you do there don't affect you.</t4352> <t4353>If in some ghastly operating room or some stinking laboratory, you see this person lying on a lead table with red channels draining blood through it, you would only look at him as an admirable subject.</t4353> <t4354>You wouldn't even blink.</t4354> <t4355>You wouldn't think you were doing anything wrong.</t4355> <t4356>On the contrary, you would probably feel that you are helping humanity, or increasing the total sum of worldly knowledge, or satisfying intellectual curiosity, or something of that sort.</t4356> <t4357>What I need you to do is just what you have always done before.</t4357> <t4358>In fact, destroying a corpse must be much less horrible than what you are used to doing.</t4358> <t4359>And, remember, it is the only evidence against me.</t4359> <t4360>If it is discovered, I lose; and it will certainly be discovered unless you help me.”</t4360>
<t4361>“I don't want to help you.</t4361> <t4362>Did you forget?</t4362> <t4363>I'm simply indifferent to this whole thing.</t4363> <t4364>It has nothing to do with me.”</t4364>
<t4365>“Alan, I beg you.</t4365> <t4366>Think about the situation I am in.</t4366> <t4367>Just before you arrived, I almost fainted from fear.</t4367> <t4368>Someday, you might know that terror yourself.</t4368> <t4369>No! Don’t think that. Look at the issue purely from a scientific perspective.</t4369> <t4370>You never asked where the deadly things you experiment on came from.</t4370> <t4371>And don’t ask now.</t4371> <t4372>I’ve already told you too much.</t4372> <t4373>But I ask you to do this.</t4373> <t4374>We were friends once, Alan.”</t4374>
<t4375>“Don't talk about those days anymore, Dorian: they are dead.”</t4375>
<t4376>"Death sometimes delays."</t4376> <t4377>"The person upstairs will not go far."</t4377> <t4378>"He sits by the table with his head bowed and his arms outstretched."</t4378> <t4379>"Alan! Alan!"</t4379> <t4380>"If you don't help me, I am doomed."</t4380> <t4381>"Why, because they will hang me, Alan! Do you understand?"</t4371> <t4382>"They will hang me for what I have done."</t4382>
<t4383>“There is nothing good about prolonging this scene.</t4383> <t4384>I am determined to refuse to do anything in this matter.</t4384> <t4385>You are really crazy to ask me.”</t4385>
<t4386>"You refuse?"</t4386>
<t4387>"Correct."</t4387>
<t4388>“I beg you, Alan.”</t4388>
<t4389>"It's useless."</t4389>
<t4390>That look of pity reappeared in Dorian Gray's eyes. Then he reached out, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it.</t4390> <t4391>He read it twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.</t4391> <t4392>After finishing this task, he stood up and approached the window.</t4392>
<t4393>Campbell looked at him in surprise, then picked up the piece of paper and opened it.</t4393> <t4394>As he read it, his face turned as pale as a corpse, and he fell back into his chair.</t4394> <t4395>A terrible feeling of nausea overwhelmed him.</t4395> <t4396>He felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some deep, empty void.</t4396>
<t4397>After a few terrifying minutes of silence, Dorian turned around, stood behind him, and placed his hand on his shoulder.</t4397>
<t4398>“I am very sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you have left me no other choice.</t4398> <t4399>I have a letter already written.</t4399> <t4400>Here it is.</t4400> <t4401>You see the address.</t4401> <t4402>If you don't help me, I have to send it.</t4402> <t4403>If you don't help me, I will send it.</t4403> <t4404>You know what the consequences will be.</t4404> <t4405>But you are going to help me.</t4405> <t4406>Now you can't refuse me anymore.</t4406> <t4407>I tried to spare you.</t4407> <t4408>You will have to be fair to me and admit that.</t4408> <t4409>You have been strict, harsh, aggressive.</t4409> <t4410>You have treated me in a way that no one has ever dared to treat me — no living person, anyway.</t4410> <t4411>I have endured it all.</t4412> <t4412>Now it's my turn to set the terms.”</t4412>
<t4413>Campbell buried his face in his hands, a shiver ran through him.</t4413>
<t4414>"Yes, it's my turn to set the conditions, Alan.</t4414> <t4415>You already know what they are.</t4415> <t4416>It's very simple.</t4416> <t4417>Come on, stop making a fuss.</t4417> <t4418>It needs to be done.</t4418> <t4419>Face it, deal with it."</t4419>
<t4420>A groan escaped Campbell's lips, and he trembled all over.</t4420> <t4421>He felt the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to divide time into atoms of agony, each one too terrible to endure.</t4421> <t4422>He felt as if an iron band was slowly tightening around his forehead, as if the humiliation he was threatened with had already descended upon him.</t4422> <t4423>The hand on his shoulder was as heavy as a leaden hand.</t4423> <t4424>He couldn't bear it.</t4424> <t4425>It seemed as if it was about to crush him.</t4425>
<t4426>"Come on, Alan, you have to decide right now."</t4426>
<t4427>"I can't do this," he said mechanically, as if words could change everything.</t4427>
<t4428>“You have to do it.</t4428> <t4429>You have no choice.</t4429> <t4430>Don't delay.</t4430><t4431>”</t4431>
<t4432>He hesitated for a moment.</t4432> <t4433>"Is there a fireplace in the room upstairs?"</t4433>
<t4434>“Yes, there is a gas heater with asbestos.</t4434><t4435>”</t4435>
<t4436>“I have to go home to get a few things from the laboratory.</t4436><t4437>”</t4437>
<t4438>"No, Alan, you must not leave this house."</t4438> <t4439>"Write down on a piece of paper what you need, and my servant will take the car to get those things for you."</t4439>
<t4440>Campbell scribbled a few lines, blotted them, and then addressed an envelope for his assistant.</t4440> <t4441>Dorian picked up the letter and read it very carefully.</t4441> <t4442>Then he rang the bell, handed it to the servant, ordered him to return as soon as possible, and to bring the items back with him.</t4442>
<t4443>When the outer hall door closed, Campbell started in worry, and, standing up from his chair, went near the fireplace.</t4443> <t4444>He shivered as if he had malaria.</t4444> <t4445>For nearly twenty minutes, no one said anything.</t4445> <t4446>A fly buzzed noisily around the room, the ticking of the clock sounded like hammer blows.</t4446>
<t4447>When the clock struck one, Campbell returned, and, looking at Dorian Gray, saw that his eyes were full of tears.</t4447> <t4448>There was something in the purity and elegance of that sorrowful face that seemed to drive him mad.</t4448> <t4449>"You are vile, utterly vile!" he muttered.</t4449>
<t4450>"Shh, Alan: you saved my life," Dorian said.</t4450>
<t4451>“Your life? Oh God! What kind of life is this!</t4451> <t4452>You go from one corruption to another, now you have reached the peak with a crime.</t4452> <t4453>To do what I am about to do, what you force me to do, I do not think about your life.”</t4453>
<t4454>"Oh, Alan," Dorian murmured with a sigh, "I wish you would show me even one-thousandth of the compassion I have for you." He turned away as he spoke, looking out into the garden.</t4454> <t4455>Campbell did not reply.</t4455>
<t4456>A few minutes later, a knock on the door echoed, and a servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest containing chemicals, a long coil of steel and platinum wire with two rather oddly shaped iron clamps.</t4456>
<t4457>"May I leave my things here, sir?" he asked Campbell.</t4457>
<t4458>“Alright,” Dorian said. “And I’m afraid, Francis, I have another errand for you. What’s the name of that person in Richmond who still supplies orchids to Selby?”</t4458>
<t4459>“Harden, sir.”</t4459>
<t4460>“That's right — Harden.</t4460> <t4461>You need to go down to Richmond immediately, meet Harden in person, and tell him to send double the number of orchids I ordered, with as few white ones as possible.</t4461> <t4462>In fact, I don't want any white ones at all.</t4462> <t4463>It's a beautiful day today, Francis, and Richmond is a very lovely place, otherwise, I wouldn't trouble you with this.”</t4463>
<t4464>"It's alright, sir.</t4464> <t4465>When do I have to return?"</t4465>
<t4466>Dorian looked at Campbell.</t4466> <t4467>"How long will your experiment take, Alan?" he said, in a calm, indifferent voice.</t4467> <t4468>The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him unusual courage.</t4468>
<t4469>Campbell frowned, biting his lip.</t4469> <t4470>“It will take about five hours,” he replied.</t4470>
<t4471>“So if you come back at seven-thirty, that will be enough time, Francis.</t4471> <t4472>Or just stay there: just have my clothes prepared and laid out.</t4472> <t4473>You have a free afternoon for yourself.</t4473> <t4474>I'm not having dinner at home, so I won't need you.”</t4474>
<t4475>“Thank you, sir,” the servant said, leaving the room.</t4475> <t4476>“Now then, Alan, we shouldn't waste a moment.</t4476> <t4477>Why is this chest so heavy! I'll carry it for you.</t4477> <t4478>You carry those other things.” He said quickly, in a commanding tone.</t4478> <t4479>Campbell felt dominated by him.</t4479> <t4480>They left the room together.</t4480>
<t4481>When they reached the top of the stairs, Dorian took out a key and turned it in the lock.</t4481> <t4482>Then he stopped, a look of worry appearing in his eyes.</t4482> <t4483>He shuddered.</t4483> <t4484>"I don't think I can go in, Alan," he muttered.</t4484>
<t4485>"A trivial matter to me.</t4485> <t4486>I don't need you," Campbell said coldly.</t4486>
<t4487>Dorian slightly opened the door.</t4487> <t4488>As he did so, he saw the face of his portrait sneering at him in the sunlight.</t4488> <t4489>On the floor, opposite it, the torn curtain was lying.</t4489> <t4490>He remembered that, the night before, for the first time in his life, he had forgotten to cover the cursed canvas, and had almost rushed forward, when he was pulled back by a shudder.</t4490>
<t4491>Where did that disgusting red drop of dew come from, glistening wet, shining on that hand, like a canvas sweating blood? How horrifying it was! — more horrifying, as you felt at that moment, compared to the silence that you knew was stretching across the table, the thing whose misshapen shadow on the stained carpet showed you that it wasn't moving, but still there, just as you left it.</t4491>
<t4492>He let out a deep breath, opened the door a bit wider, and with half-closed eyes and a turned-away head, quickly stepped in, determined not to look even once at the dead person.</t4492> <t4493>Then, bending down, he picked up the golden and purple curtain and threw it straight over the painting.</t4493>
<t4494>He stopped there, feeling afraid to turn around, and his eyes were fixed on the intricate patterns in front of him.</t4494> <t4495>He heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, the iron items, and other things he required for his gruesome work.</t4495> <t4496>He began to wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they thought of each other?</t4496>
<t4497>"Now just leave me alone," a stern voice spoke up behind him.</t4497>
<t4498>He turned around and hurried out, only realizing that the dead person had been pushed back into the chair, while Campbell was staring at the shiny yellow face.</t4498> <t4499>As he descended the stairs, he heard the sound of a key turning in the lock.</t4499>
<t4500>When Campbell returned to the library, it was well past seven o'clock.</t4500> <t4501>He was pale, but completely calm.</t4501> <t4502>“I have done what you asked me to do,” he muttered. “And now, goodbye.</t4502> <t4503>We will never see each other again.”</t4503>
<t4504>"You saved me, otherwise I would have been done for, Alan.</t4504> <t4505>I can't forget that," Dorian said simply.</t4505>
<t4506>As soon as Campbell got back, he went straight upstairs.</t4506> <t4507>There was a terrible smell of nitric acid in the room.</t4507> <t4508>But the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone.</t4508>
<t4509>Chapter 15</t4509>
<t4510>That evening, at half-past eight, dressed elegantly and with a large bunch of Parma larkspur pinned to his lapel, Dorian Gray was ushered into Mrs. Narborough's drawing-room by the bowing servants. His forehead was throbbing with furious nerves, and he felt intensely agitated, but his demeanor as he bowed over the hostess's hand remained as composed and graceful as ever.</t4510> <t4511>Perhaps one never seems so at ease as when one is playing a part.</t4511> <t4512>Surely no one who saw Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he had just gone through a tragedy as terrible as any of our age.</t4512> <t4513>Those beautifully shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife to commit a crime, and those smiling lips could never have uttered blasphemies against God and goodness.</t4513> <t4514>Even he could not help but be amazed at his own calm demeanor, and for a moment, he felt the terrible deep joy of living a double life.</t4514>
<t4515>It was a small party, hastily prepared by Mrs. Narborough, a very intelligent woman, with what Lord Henry often described as the remnants of truly extraordinary ugliness.</t4515> <t4516>She had proven to be a wonderful lady of one of our most insipid ambassadors, and after carefully burying her husband in a marble tomb, which she designed herself, and marrying off her daughters to several wealthy, rather old men, she now devoted herself to the pleasures of French novels, French culinary arts, and French wit whenever she could grasp it.</t4516>
<t4517>Dorian was one of the people she was particularly fond of, and she always told him that she was extremely happy not to have known him when she was young.</t4517> <t4518>“I know, dear, that I might have gone madly in love with you,” she often said, “and thrown my cap over the windmill for you.</t4518> <t4519>Luckily, you weren't even thought of back then.</t4519> <t4520>Besides, our clothes were too ugly, and the windmill too calm, so I never even had a single flirtation with anyone.</t4520> <t4521>However, that was entirely Narborough's fault.</t4521> <t4522>He was terribly nearsighted, and there was no fun in deceiving a husband who never saw anything.”</t4522>
<t4523>The guests that afternoon were quite boring.</t4523> <t4524>The thing is, as she explained to Dorian behind a very worn fan, one of her married daughters had suddenly moved in with her, and, to make matters worse, had brought her husband along.</t4524> <t4525>"I think she's very mean, dear," she whispered.</t4525> <t4526>"Of course, I stay with them every summer after I return from Homburg, but after all, an old lady like me sometimes needs fresh air, and besides, I really stir them up.</t4526> <t4527>You have no idea what kind of life they lead down there.</t4527> <t4528>A simple, rustic country life.</t4528> <t4529>They wake up early because there's so much to do, and go to bed early because there's so little to think about.</t4529> <t4530>There hasn't been a scandal in the village since the time of Queen Elizabeth, so they all fall asleep after dinner.</t4530> <t4531>You won't have to sit next to both of them.</t4531> <t4532>You will sit next to me and make me happy."</t4532>
<t4533>Dorian softly uttered a graceful compliment and looked around the room.</t4533> <t4534>Indeed: it was a dull party.</t4534> <t4535>Among them were two people he had never seen before, and the others included Ernest Harrowden, one of those very common middle-aged civilians at London clubs, a man with no enemies but deeply hated by his friends; Mrs. Ruxton, an overly dressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, always deliberately putting herself in harm's way, but so particularly naive that no one ever believed anything against her to the point of frustration; Mrs. Erlynne, an audacious nobody with an interesting lisp and Venetian red hair; Miss Alice Chapman, the hostess's daughter, a dull-witted girl dressed out of fashion, with one of those distinctly English faces that once seen is never remembered; and her husband, a rosy-cheeked, white-whiskered creature who, like many of his class, believed that excessive cheerfulness could make up for the complete absence of thought.</t4535>
<t4536>Dorian felt quite regretful for having come here, until Mrs. Narborough, looking at the large gilded bronze clock that was languidly curving its ornate lines on the pale purple curtain holder above the fireplace, exclaimed loudly: "Why is Henry Wotton so terribly late!</t4536> <t4537>This morning I sent a message to his house on a whim, and he promised me he would definitely not disappoint me."</t4537>
<t4538>If Harry were here, it would be somewhat comforting, and when the door opened and he heard the melodious, deliberate voice adding a touch of charm to some insincere apology, he no longer felt sad.</t4538>
<t4539>But he couldn't eat anything at dinner.</t4539> <t4540>Dish after dish was taken away untouched.</t4540> <t4541>Mrs. Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an affront to poor Adolphe, who had devised the menu especially for him,” and occasionally Lord Henry glanced at him, surprised by his silence and distracted demeanor.</t4541> <t4542>From time to time, the butler refilled his glass with champagne.</t4542> <t4543>He drank eagerly, and his thirst seemed to grow more intense.</t4543>
<t4544>“Dorian,” Lord Henry finally said, as the chaud-froid was being passed around, “what's the matter with you tonight? You seem very upset.</t4544><t4545>”</t4545>
<t4546>1 Frozen meat.</t4546>
<t4547>"I believe he is in love," exclaimed Mrs. Narborough, "and he is afraid to tell me because he worries that I will be jealous.</t4547> <t4548>He is absolutely right.</t4548> <t4549>I would certainly be jealous.</t4549><t4550>"</t4550>
<t4551>"Dear Mrs. Narborough," Dorian murmured, smiling, "I haven't been in love for a whole week — truly not since Madame de Ferrol left town."</t4551>
<t4552>“How can you men love that woman!” the old lady shouted.</t4552> <t4553>“I really can't understand.”</t4553>
<t4554>“Simply because she remembers you as a petite young girl, Mrs. Narborough,” Lord Henry said.</t4554> <t4555>“She is the only link between us and your short dresses.”</t4555>
<t4556>“She doesn't remember anything about my short dresses, Lord Henry.</t4556> <t4557>But I remember her very well in Vienna thirty years ago, and how décolletée1 she was back then.”</t4557>
<t4558>1 Wear an off-shoulder top.</t4558>
<t4559>“She is still décolletée,” he replied, picking up an olive with his long fingers; “and when she wears a very elegant dress, she looks like a deluxe edition of a terribly bad French novel.</t4559> <t4560>She is truly wonderful, and full of surprises. “Her ability to love her family is extraordinary.</t4560> <t4561>When her third husband died, her hair turned golden from grief.</t4561><t4562>”</t4562>
<t4563>2 Premium prints.</t4563>
<t4564>“How could you, Harry!” Dorian exclaimed.</t4564>
<t4565>“A very romantic explanation,” the hostess laughed.</t4565> <t4566>“But her third husband, Lord Henry! You don't mean to say Ferrol is the fourth, do you?”</t4566>
<t4567>“That's right, Mrs. Narborough.”</t4567>
<t4568>"I don't believe it at all."</t4568>
<t4569>“Then ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her closest friends.”</t4569>
<t4570>“Is that true, Mr. Gray?”</t4570>
<t4571>“She is so determined, Mrs. Narborough,” said Dorian.</t4571> <t4572>“I asked her if, like Marguerite de Navarre, she preserved their hearts and hung them at her waist.</t4572> <t4573>She told me she didn't, because none of them had any hearts at all.”</t4573>
<t4574>"Four husbands! I swear on my honor, that's too much zeal."</t4574>
<t4575>“Too much audacity2, I told her that,” Dorian said.</t4575>
<t4576>Too excited.</t4576>
<t4577>Too daring.</t4577>
<t4578>“Oh! She has the guts to do anything, my friend.</t4578> <t4579>And what about Ferrol?</t4579> <t4580>I don't know him.”</t4580>
<t4581>"The husbands of beautiful women are all thieves," said Lord Henry as he sipped his drink.</t4581>
<t4582>Mrs. Narborough tapped him with her fan. "Lord Henry, I am not at all surprised that people say you are extremely wicked."</t4582>
<t4583>“But who said that?” Lord Henry said, raising an eyebrow.</t4583> <t4584>“It could only be someone from the future.</t4584> <t4585>I have a very good relationship with people of this time.”</t4585>
<t4586>“Everyone I know says you are very depraved,” the old woman exclaimed, shaking her head.</t4586>
<t4587>Lord Henry looked very serious for a moment.</t4587> <t4588>“How dreadful,” he finally said, “the way people nowadays gossip behind one's back about things that are absolutely and entirely true.”</t4588>
<t4589>“Is he incorrigible?” Dorian exclaimed, leaning forward in his chair.</t4589>
<t4590>"I hope so," the hostess said with a smile.</t4590> <t4591>"But really, if all of you worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous manner, I will have to remarry to keep up with the trend."</t4591>
<t4592>"You will never remarry, Mrs. Narborough," Lord Henry interrupted.</t4592> <t4593>"You are too happy.</t4593> <t4594>Women remarry because they hate their first husband.</t4594> <t4595>Men remarry because they are enamored with their first wife.</t4595> <t4596>Women take a chance; men take a risk."</t4596>
<t4597>“Narborough is not perfect either,” the old lady exclaimed.</t4597>
<t4598>“If he were like that, you probably wouldn't have loved him, madam,” was the reply.</t4598> <t4599>“Women love us for our weaknesses.</t4599> <t4600>If we have enough of those, they will forgive us for everything, even intelligence.</t4600> <t4601>You will never invite me to dinner again after this remark, I fear, will you, Mrs. Narborough; but it is entirely accurate.”</t4601>
<t4602>"Of course it's accurate, Lord Henry.</t4602> <t4603>If we women didn't love you for your weaknesses, what would become of all of you?</t4603> <t4604>None of you would ever get married.</t4604> <t4605>You would all be an unhappy bunch of bachelors.</t4605> <t4606>No, after all, that wouldn't change you much.</t4606> <t4607>Nowadays, a married man lives like a bachelor, and a bachelor lives like a married man."</t4607>
<t4608>"End of the century," Lord Henry muttered.</t4608>
<t4609>"End of the world2," the hostess replied.</t4609>
<t4610>1 End of the century.</t4610>
<t4611>2 Apocalypse.</t4611>
<t4612>"I hope it is the end of the world," Dorian sighed, saying.</t4612> <t4613>"Life is one great disappointment.</t4613><t4614>"</t4614>
<t4615>"Oh, dear," Mrs. Narborough exclaimed, putting on her gloves, "don't tell me that you have exhausted Life already.</t4615> <t4616>When someone says that, it is immediately clear that Life has exhausted them.</t4616> <t4617>Lord Henry is very corrupt, and sometimes I wish I were too; but you were made to be a good person — you look so decent.</t4617> <t4618>I must find you a beautiful wife.</t4618> <t4619>Lord Henry, do you think Mr. Gray here should get married?”</t4619>
<t4620>"I always tell him that, Mrs. Narborough," Lord Henry said, with a bow.</t4620>
<t4621>"Alright, we have to find a suitable match for you.</t4621> <t4622>Tonight, I will thoroughly review Debrett and draft a list of all the eligible young ladies."</t4622>
<t4623>“With their age too, right Mrs. Narborough?” Dorian asked.</t4623>
<t4624>“Of course, at their age, there are some minor adjustments.</t4624> <t4625>But there's no need to rush.</t4625> <t4626>I want it to be what The Morning Post calls a well-matched marriage, and I want you two to be happy.</t4626><t4627>”</t4627>
<t4628>“People have said so many nonsensical things about happy marriages!” Lord Henry exclaimed. “A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her.”</t4628>
<t4629>"Oh! You really are a mocker!" the old lady exclaimed, pushing her chair back and nodding at Mrs. Ruxton.</t4629> <t4630>"You must come to dinner with me again soon.</t4630> <t4631>You truly are a wonderful tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew prescribed for me.</t4631> <t4632>However, you must tell me what kind of people you like to meet.</t4632> <t4633>I want it to be an interesting gathering."</t4633>
<t4634>“I like men with a future, and women with a past,” he replied.</t4634> <t4635>“Or do you think that will make it too much of a ladies' party?”</t4635>
<t4636>“I'm afraid so,” she said with a smile, as she stood up.</t4636> <t4637>“A thousand apologies, my dear Mrs. Ruxton,” she added.</t4637> <t4638>“I didn't realize you hadn't finished your cigarette.</t4638><t4639>”</t4639>
<t4640>"Don't worry, Mrs. Narborough. I smoke too much."</t4640> <t4641>"I am about to cut down, for the future."</t4641><t4642>"</t4642>
<t4643>“Please don't, Mrs. Ruxton,” said Lord Henry.</t4643> <t4644>“Abstinence is a very harmful thing.</t4644> <t4645>Moderation is like a regular meal.</t4645> <t4646>Excess is like a lavish banquet.”</t4646>
<t4647>Mrs. Ruxton looked at him curiously.</t4647> <t4648>"You must come and explain that to me one afternoon, Lord Henry."</t4648> <t4649>"It sounds like a fascinating theory," she said softly as she grandly exited the room.</t4649>
<t4650>"Now, be sure not to linger too long on politics and scandals," Mrs. Narborough called out from the door.</t4650> <t4651>"If you do, we are sure to argue upstairs."</t4651>
<t4652>Everyone burst into laughter, Mr. Chapman leisurely stood up from the end of the table and walked to the head.</t4652> <t4653>Dorian Gray changed his seat, sitting next to Lord Henry again.</t4653> <t4654>Mr. Chapman began to speak loudly about the situation in the House of Commons.</t4654> <t4655>He laughed heartily at his opponents.</t4655> <t4656>The term demagogue — a word that horrifies the English mind — appeared repeatedly amidst the uproarious laughter.</t4656> <t4657>An alliterative prefix was used as an ornament for his rhetoric.</t4657> <t4658>He hoisted the British flag to the pinnacle of Thought.</t4658> <t4659>The inherited dullness of the race — the sound common sense of the English as he cheerfully called it — proved to be a suitable bulwark for Society.</t4659>
<t4660>A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, and he turned to look at Dorian.</t4660>
<t4661>"Are you feeling better, my friend?" he asked.</t4661> <t4662>"You seemed quite uncomfortable during dinner."</t4662>
<t4663>“I'm fine, Harry. I'm just a bit tired.</t4663> <t4664>That's all.”</t4664>
<t4665>"You were very charming last night.</t4665> <t4666>The little duchess was very devoted to you.</t4666> <t4667>She told me that she would go down to Selby."</t4667>
<t4668>“She promised to come on the twentieth.”</t4668>
<t4669>"Is Monmouth going there too?"</t4669>
<t4670>“Ah, yes, Harry.”</t4670>
<t4671>“He bores me to death, almost as much as he bores her.</t4671> <t4672>She is very intelligent, too intelligent for a woman.</t4672> <t4673>She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness.</t4673> <t4674>It is the feet of clay that make the golden statue precious.</t4674> <t4675>Her feet are very beautiful, but they are not feet of clay.</t4675> <t4676>Porcelain feet, if you like.</t4676> <t4677>They have been through the fire, and what the fire does not destroy, it hardens.</t4677> <t4678>She is experienced.”</t4678>
<t4679>“How long has she been married?” Dorian asked.</t4679>
<t4680>“An endless amount of time, she told me so.</t4680> <t4681>I think, according to the noble genealogy book, it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must feel like an eternity, with time thrown into it.</t4681> <t4682>Did anyone else come?”</t4682>
<t4683>“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby with his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, a group as always.</t4683> <t4684>I have already asked Lord Grotrian.”</t4684>
<t4685>"I like him," Lord Henry said.</t4685> <t4686>"Many people don't, but I find him charming.</t4686> <t4687>He compensates for the occasional overdressing by always being highly educated.</t4687> <t4688>He is a very modern type of person."</t4688>
<t4689>“I don't know if he can come, Harry. He might have to go to Monte Carlo with his father.”</t4689>
<t4690>“Oh! How troublesome public figures are! Try to invite him over.</t4690> <t4691>By the way, Dorian, you left too early last night.</t4691> <t4692>You left before eleven o'clock.</t4692> <t4693>What did you do after that? Did you go straight home?”</t4693>
<t4694>Dorian hastily looked at him and frowned. "No, Harry," he finally said, "I didn't get home until nearly three o'clock."</t4694>
<t4695>"Are you going to the club?"</t4695>
<t4696>"Yes," he replied.</t4696> <t4697>Then he bit his lip. "No, I didn't mean to say that.</t4697> <t4698>I didn't go to the club. I wandered around.</t4698> <t4699>I forgot what I did...</t4699> <t4700>Why are you so curious, Harry! You always want to know what people have done.</t4700> <t4701>I always want to forget what I've done.</t4701> <t4702>I got home at half past two, if you want to know the exact time.</t4702> <t4703>I forgot my keys at home, so my servant had to open the door for me.</t4703> <t4704>If you need any concrete proof of this, you can ask him."</t4704>
<t4705>Lord Henry shrugged. "My friend, as if I care! Let's go to the drawing room."</t4705> <t4706>I don't drink sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.</t4706> <t4707>Something has happened to you, Dorian.</t4707> <t4708>Tell me what it is. You are not yourself tonight."</t4708>
<t4709>"Don't mind me, Harry. I'm irritable and losing my temper.</t4709> <t4710>I'll come see you tomorrow or the day after.</t4710> <t4711>Give my apologies to Mrs. Narborough.</t4711> <t4712>I can't go upstairs.</t4712> <t4713>I'll go home.</t4713> <t4714>I must go home."</t4714>
<t4715>"Alright, Dorian.</t4715> <t4716>I believe I will see you tomorrow at tea time.</t4716> <t4717>The Duchess will be coming."</t4717>
<t4718>"I will try to get there, Harry," he said and left the room.</t4718> <t4719>As he ran back to his house, he realized that the feeling of fear he thought he had suppressed was returning to him.</t4719> <t4720>The unintentional inquiry of Lord Henry had unnerved him for a moment, and he needed to regain his composure.</t4720> <t4721>Dangerous things must be destroyed.</t4721> <t4722>He cringed.</t4722> <t4723>He hated even the thought of touching them.</t4723>
<t4724>However, that task still had to be completed.</t4724> <t4725>He realized this, and after he had locked his library door, he opened the secret closet where he had stuffed Basil Hallward's cloak and bag.</t4725> <t4726>A large fireplace was blazing fiercely.</t4726> <t4727>He added another log to it.</t4727> <t4728>The smell of burning clothes and singed leather was truly awful.</t4728> <t4729>It took him about forty-five minutes to burn everything completely.</t4729> <t4730>At the end, he felt dizzy and nauseous, and after burning a few sticks of Algerian incense in a perforated bronze censer, he washed his hands and forehead with cool musk-scented vinegar.</t4730>
<t4731>Suddenly, he was startled.</t4731> <t4732>His eyes lit up in a strange way, and he nervously bit his lower lip.</t4732> <t4733>Between the two windows stood a large Florence cabinet, made of ebony, inlaid with ivory and lapis lazuli.</t4733> <t4734>He looked at it as if it could hypnotize or cause fear, as if it held something he desired yet almost detested.</t4734> <t4735>His breath quickened.</t4735> <t4736>A mad desire overwhelmed him.</t4736> <t4737>He lit a cigarette and then threw it away.</t4737> <t4738>His eyelids drooped until those long fringed lashes almost touched his cheeks.</t4738> <t4739>But he still looked at the cabinet. Finally, he got up from the sofa he was lying on, approached it, and, after opening it, touched some hidden spring.</t4739> <t4740>A triangular drawer slowly slid out.</t4740> <t4741>His fingers instinctively fumbled towards it, reaching inside, close to something.</t4741> <t4742>It was a Chinese lacquer box with black and gold dust, intricately crafted, the sides decorated with undulating waves, with silk cords hanging round crystals and tassels braided with metallic threads.</t4742> <t4743>He opened it.</t4743> <t4744>Inside was a greenish-blue lump, shiny like wax, with a strangely persistent and heavy scent.</t4744>
<t4745>He hesitated for a moment, with a strange, motionless smile on his face.</t4745> <t4746>Then he shivered, even though the air in the room was unbearably hot, he straightened up, glanced at the clock.</t4746> <t4747>It was twenty to twelve.</t4747> <t4748>He pushed the box back, closed the cabinet door as he did so, and went into the bedroom.</t4748>
<t4749>At midnight, as the chimes echoed through the dim sky, Dorian Gray, dressed in common clothes with a scarf wrapped around his neck, quietly slipped out of the house.</t4749> <t4750>On Bond Street, he saw a two-wheeled carriage with a fine horse.</t4750> <t4751>He hailed it and softly gave the address to the coachman.</t4751>
<t4752>The person shook their head.</t4752> <t4753>"Too far for me," he muttered.</t4753>
<t4754>“Here, a sovereign for you,” Dorian said.</t4754> <t4755>“You can get another one if you run fast.</t4755><t4756>”</t4756>
<t4757>“Yes, sir,” the man replied, “you will be there within an hour,” and after the fare was in his pocket, he turned the horse and sped quickly towards the river.</t4757>
<t4758>Chapter 16</t4758>
<t4759>Cold rain began to fall, the streetlights blurred, looking truly eerie in the soaking mist.</t4759> <t4760>The pubs had just closed, and men and women were faintly gathering into fragmented groups around the doors.</t4760> <t4761>From a few bars came horrifying laughter.</t4761> <t4762>At other bars, the drunkards were arguing and shouting.</t4762>
<t4763>Lying on his back in the car, hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian Gray listlessly watched the sordid shame of that great city, and occasionally he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him the very first day they met, "Cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul." Yes, that was the secret.</t4763> <t4764>He often tried it, and would try it again right now.</t4764> <t4765>There were opium dens, where one could buy oblivion, hideous haunts where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of new ones.</t4765>
<t4766>The waning moon hung in the sky like a golden skull.</t4766> <t4767>Occasionally, a gigantic misshapen cloud would stretch its long arm across and obscure it.</t4767> <t4768>Gas lamps became rarer, the streets narrower and gloomier.</t4768> <t4769>The coachman once got lost and had to turn back half a mile.</t4769> <t4770>Steam rose from the horse as it splashed through a puddle of rainwater.</t4770> <t4771>The windows on the side of the carriage were sealed with a gray flannel mist.</t4771>
<t4772>“Healing the soul by using the senses, and healing the senses by using the soul!” How these words resonated in his ears! His soul was surely fed up.</t4772> <t4773>Is it true that the senses can heal it?</t4773> <t4774>Innocent blood has been shed.</t4774> <t4775>What can atone for that sin?</t4775> <t4776>Oh! There is no redemption for that sin; but even if it cannot be forgiven, it can still be forgotten, and he decided to forget, to erase it, to crush it as one would crush a venomous snake.</t4776> <t4777>Indeed, what right did Basil have to speak to him as he did?</t4777> <t4778>Who made him judge over others? He had said terrible, disgusting, unbearable things.</t4778>
<t4779>He felt as if the two-wheeled carriage was laboriously dragging itself along, dragging itself along, slowing down with each step.</t4779> <t4780>He pushed up the trapdoor and called out to the coachman to make the carriage go faster.</t4780> <t4781>The horrible craving for drugs began to torment him.</t4781> <t4782>His throat burned, and his soft hands twitched restlessly.</t4782> <t4783>He beat the horse madly with his stick.</t4783> <t4784>The coachman laughed and urged the horse forward.</t4784> <t4785>He laughed in response, and the coachman fell silent.</t4785>
<t4786>The road seemed endless, and the streets like a black web of a spider sprawled somewhere.</t4786> <t4787>The monotony became unbearable, and, as the fog thickened, he felt afraid.</t4787>
<t4788>Then they ran past the desolate brickworks.</t4788> <t4789>The fog here was thinner, and he could see the strange bottle-shaped kilns with orange tongues of flame that looked like fans.</t4789> <t4790>A dog barked loudly as they ran past, and far away, in the darkness, some wandering seagull screeched.</t4790> <t4791>The horse stumbled on the trail, then turned aside, and suddenly broke into a gallop.</t4791>
<t4792>A moment later, they left the dirt road and started clattering along the rough cobbled streets again.</t4792> <t4793>Most of the windows were dark, but occasionally strange shadows were cast on the lit curtains.</t4793> <t4794>He curiously observed them.</t4794> <t4795>They moved like giant puppets, gesturing as if they were alive.</t4795> <t4796>He hated them.</t4796> <t4797>A smoldering anger burned in his heart.</t4797> <t4798>As they turned a corner, a woman shouted something at them from an open window, and two men chased the carriage for about a hundred yards before giving up.</t4798> <t4799>The coachman whipped them with a leather strap.</t4799>
<t4800>It is rumored that passion makes people think in circles.</t4800> <t4801>Indeed, with the monotonous repetition, Dorian Gray's tightly pressed lips kept molding and reshaping those wicked words about the soul and emotions, until he saw in them the full expression, so to speak, of his mood, and justified, with the approval of intelligence, the passions that without such justification would still dominate his mood.</t4801> <t4802>From one brain cell to another, a thought sneaked through; and the intense craving for life, the most terrible of all human desires, revived powerfully every nerve and each trembling muscle fiber.</t4802> <t4803>The ugliness that he once found repulsive because it brought things back to reality now became dear to him for that very reason.</t4803> <t4804>Ugliness was the only reality.</t4804> <t4805>The obscene quarrels, the disgusting den, the crude violence of a disordered life, and even the baseness of the street thieves, were more vivid, thanks to their intense impression of reality, than any form of decent Art, the dreamy shadows of Poetry.</t4805> <t4806>They were what he needed to forget.</t4806> <t4807>He would be free in three days.</t4807>
<t4808>Suddenly, the person stopped the vehicle with a sudden, strong jerk at the head of a dark alley.</t4808> <t4809>On the low, squat roofs and the jagged clusters of chimneys of the houses, the black masts of ships rose up.</t4809> <t4810>Billowing white fog clung to the taut masts like ghostly sails.</t4810>
<t4811>"Somewhere around here, perhaps, sir?" he asked hoarsely through the trapdoor.</t4811>
<t4812>Dorian started, looking around.</t4812> <t4813>“Alright then,” he replied, and, after hastily getting out, handed the coachman the extra tip he had promised him, and walked briskly towards the harbor.</t4813> <t4814>Here and there, lanterns flickered at the stern of some gigantic merchant ship.</t4814> <t4815>The light shimmered and shattered in the puddles.</t4815> <t4816>A glaring red light was cast from an ocean-going steamship taking on coal.</t4816> <t4817>The slimy pavement looked like a wet raincoat.</t4817>
<t4818>You hurriedly continued to the left, occasionally glancing back to see if you were being followed.</t4818> <t4819>After about seven or eight minutes, you arrived at a small, dilapidated house, wedged between two abandoned factories.</t4819> <t4820>In a high window, there was a lamp.</t4820> <t4821>You stopped and knocked a distinctive knock.</t4821>
<t4822>A moment later, he heard footsteps in the hallway, and the chain being unhooked.</t4822> <t4823>The door opened silently, and he stepped in without saying a word to the short, fat, deformed figure that had flattened itself into a shadow as he passed by.</t4823> <t4824>At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain, trembling and swaying in the gust of wind that had followed him in from the street.</t4824> <t4825>He pulled it aside and stepped into a long, low room that looked as if it had once been a third-rate dance hall.</t4825> <t4826>The gas lamps blazed brightly, hissing deafeningly, blurred and distorted in the fly-specked mirrors facing them, arranged in rows around the walls.</t4826> <t4827>The tin reflectors behind them, greasy and embossed, cast out trembling discs of light.</t4827> <t4828>The floor was covered in ochre-colored sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, stained with dark rings from spilled spirits.</t4828> <t4829>A few Malays crouched by a small charcoal stove, playing with bone tiles, revealing white teeth as they chattered.</t4829> <t4830>In one corner, with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled across a table, and by the garishly painted bar running along one wall, two haggard women stood teasing an old man who was brushing off his coat with a look of disgust.</t4830> <t4831>“He thinks he's got red ants on him,” one of the women laughed, as Dorian walked past.</t4831> <t4832>The man looked at her in terror and began to whimper.</t4832>
<t4833>At the end of the room, there was a small staircase leading up to a darkened chamber.</t4833> <t4834>As Dorian hurriedly climbed the three creaky steps, the strong smell of opium greeted him.</t4834> <t4835>He took a deep breath, his nose trembling with pleasure.</t4835> <t4836>When he entered, a young man with sleek blonde hair, bent over a lamp and lighting a small long pipe, looked at him and nodded in greeting with a hesitant attitude.</t4836>
<t4837>"Is that you, Adrian?" Dorian muttered.</t4837>
<t4838>"Where else could I be?" he replied, listlessly.</t4838> <t4839>"Now no one is willing to talk to me anymore."</t4839>
<t4840>“I thought you had left England.”</t4840>
<t4841>“Darlington doesn't do anything.</t4841> <t4842>In the end, my brother paid the bill.</t4842> <t4843>George doesn't talk to me either… I don't care,” he added, with a sigh.</t4843> <t4844>“As long as I have this thing, I don't need friends.</t4844> <t4845>I think I have too many friends.”</t4845>
<t4846>Dorian grimaced, looking around at the bizarre things lying in very strange positions on the torn mattresses.</t4846> <t4847>Twisted limbs, wide-open mouths, dull eyes glaring, hypnotizing him.</t4847> <t4848>He knew they were enduring suffering in some strange paradises, and some gray hells were teaching them some new secret of joy.</t4848> <t4849>They were better off than him.</t4849> <t4850>He was imprisoned in thought.</t4850> <t4851>Memory, like a terrible disease, was slowly consuming his soul.</t4851> <t4852>Sometimes it seemed he saw Basil Hallward's eyes looking at him.</t4852> <t4853>However, he felt he could not stay.</t4853> <t4854>The presence of Adrian Singleton disturbed him.</t4854> <t4855>He wanted to be somewhere where no one knew who he was.</t4855> <t4856>He needed to escape from himself.</t4856>
<t4857>"I will go somewhere else," he said, after a moment of hesitation.</t4857>
<t4858>“Crossing the dock?”</t4858>
<t4859>"Yes."</t4859>
<t4860>“That crazy cat will definitely be there.</t4860> <t4861>Now they don't let it in this place anymore.”</t4861>
<t4862>Dorian shrugged.</t4862> <t4863>“I’m sick of those girls who are in love with someone.</t4863> <t4864>Girls who hate someone are actually much more interesting.</t4864> <t4865>Besides, that’s also more fun.”</t4865>
<t4866>“The same.</t4866><t4867>”</t4867>
<t4868>“I like it more.”</t4868> <t4869>“Let's go get a drink.”</t4869> <t4870>“I need to drink something.”</t4870>
<t4871>“I don't want anything,” the young man muttered. “Just leave it.”</t4871>
<t4872>Adrian Singleton lazily stood up, following Dorian to the bar.</t4872> <t4873>A half-Indian man, wearing a torn turban and a worn ulster coat, grinned grotesquely as he pushed a bottle of brandy and two glasses in front of them.</t4873> <t4874>The women timidly approached and began to chatter incessantly.</t4874> <t4875>Dorian turned his back to them, whispering something to Adrian Singleton.</t4875>
<t4876>A crooked smile, like a Malay wrinkle, twisted across the face of a woman.</t4876> <t4877>“Tonight we are very proud,” she mocked.</t4877>
<t4878>"For God's sake, don't talk to me," Dorian shouted, stamping his foot on the ground.</t4878> <t4879>"What do you want? Money? Here. Never talk to me again."</t4879>
<t4880>Two red sparks flashed briefly in the dull eyes of the woman, then gradually faded, leaving them cloudy and vacant.</t4880> <t4881>She jerked her head up, greedily scraping the coins off the counter with her fingers.</t4881> <t4882>Her companion watched her with envy.</t4882>
<t4883>"It's no use," Adrian Singleton sighed.</t4883> <t4884>"I don't want to go back.</t4884> <t4885>What's the point? I'm very happy here.</t4885><t4886>"</t4886>
<t4887>“You will write to me if you need anything, promise?” Dorian said, after a moment's pause.</t4887> <t4888>“Maybe.”</t4888>
<t4889>"Well then, goodbye."</t4889>
<t4890>"Goodbye," the young man replied, walking up the steps, wiping his dry, chapped mouth with a handkerchief.</t4890>
<t4891>Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain on his face.</t4891> <t4892>As he pulled the curtain aside, a hideous laugh burst from the painted lips of the woman who had just taken his money. "A devil's bargain has just been struck!" she said with a thick, hoarse voice, hiccuping.</t4892>
<t4893>“You bitch!” he replied, “don’t call me that.”</t4893>
<t4894>She snapped her fingers.</t4894> <t4895>"Prince Charming is the name you want to be called, right?" she yelled behind him.</t4895>
<t4896>The dozing sailor jumped up when he heard the woman speak, frantically looking around.</t4896> <t4897>The sound of the hall door closing reached his ears.</t4897> <t4898>He rushed outside as if to pursue.</t4898>
<t4899>Dorian Gray hurried along the quay, through the drizzle.</t4899> <t4900>The meeting with Adrian Singleton had unsettled him strangely, and he wondered whether the degeneration of that young life was really his fault, as Basil Hallward had once told him with such shameful reproach.</t4900> <t4901>He bit his lip, and for a few seconds, his eyes grew sad.</t4901> <t4902>However, in the end, what did it matter to him?</t4902> <t4903>Life was too short to bear the burden of another's sins on one's shoulders.</t4903> <t4904>Everyone had to live their own life, and pay their own price for living it.</t4904> <t4905>The only pity was that one often had to pay so frequently for just a single mistake.</t4905> <t4906>One had to keep paying and paying, it was truly so.</t4906> <t4907>In dealings with humans, Fate never agreed to close the account.</t4907>
<t4908>Psychologists tell us that there are times when the passion for sin, or what the world calls sin, dominates human nature to such an extent that every muscle fiber, as well as every brain cell, seems to be imbued with terrifying impulses.</t4908> <t4909>Men and women in such moments often lose their freedom of will. They move towards their terrible end like automatons, the power of choice taken from them, and their conscience either killed or, if it still lives, it lives only to struggle against the temptation, and to defy its allure.</t4909> <t4910>For every sin, as theologians tirelessly remind us, is a sin of disobedience.</t4910> <t4911>When that supreme deity, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven, it was due to a rebellion that he fell.</t4911>
<t4912>Hardened, focused on evil, with a tainted soul and a spirit yearning for rebellion, Dorian Gray hurried, quickening his pace, but as he dashed aside, into the pitch-dark road under the archway that often served him as a shortcut to the infamous place he was heading to, he suddenly felt himself grabbed from behind, and before he had time to defend himself, he was shoved against the wall, with a vicious hand wrapped around his neck.</t4912>
<t4913>He struggled frantically to live, and, with a tremendous effort, managed to pry those tightly gripping fingers apart.</t4913> <t4914>In a second, he heard the click of the revolver, saw the glimmer of the shiny barrel pointing straight at his head, and the dim figure of a short, stout man facing him.</t4914>
<t4915>“What do you want?” he panted.</t4915>
<t4916>“Stay still,” the person said.</t4916> <t4917>“If you move, I will shoot you.”</t4917>
<t4918>“You're crazy.</t4918> <t4919>What have I done to you?”</t4919>
<t4920>“You ruined Sibyl Vane's life,” was the reply, “and Sibyl Vane was my sister.</t4920> <t4921>She committed suicide.</t4921> <t4922>I know about it.</t4922> <t4923>She died because of you.</t4923> <t4924>I swore I would kill you to avenge her.</t4924> <t4925>For many years, I searched for you.</t4925> <t4926>I had no clues, no traces.</t4926> <t4927>The two people who could describe you were both dead.</t4927> <t4928>I knew nothing about you except the affectionate nickname she used to call you.</t4928> <t4929>Tonight I happened to hear it.</t4929> <t4930>Pray to God, for tonight you will die.”</t4930>
<t4931>Dorian was scared to death.</t4931> <t4932>“I have never met her,” he stammered.</t4932> <t4933>“I have never heard of her.</t4933> <t4934>You are crazy.”</t4934>
<t4935>"You'd better confess, for as sure as I am James Vane, you're about to die." A dreadful moment.</t4935> <t4936>Dorian didn't know what to say or do. "Kneel down!" the man growled.</t4936> <t4937>"I'll give you one minute to pray — no more.</t4937> <t4938>Tonight, I'm boarding a ship to India, and I must do my duty first.</t4938> <t4939>One minute.</t4939> <t4940>That's all."</t4940>
<t4941>Dorian's arms fell to his sides.</t4941> <t4942>Paralyzed by fear, he didn't know what to do.</t4942> <t4943>Suddenly, a wild hope flashed through his mind. "Stop," he shouted. "How long has it been since your sister died?</t4943> <t4944>Tell me, quickly!"</t4944>
<t4945>"Eighteen years," the person said.</t4945> <t4946>"Why are you asking me?</t4946> <t4947>What does it matter how many years?"</t4947>
<t4948>"Eighteen years," Dorian Gray laughed loudly, with a hint of joy in his voice.</t4948> <t4949>"Eighteen years! Bring me under the light and look at my face!"</t4949>
<t4950>James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what it meant.</t4950> <t4951>Then he grabbed Dorian Gray and dragged him out of the archway.</t4951>
<t4952>Dim and flickering in the wind, but the light was still enough for him to see the terrible mistake he seemed to have made, because the face of the person he sought to kill had all the freshness of youth, all the purity untouched by the dust of life.</t4952> <t4953>That person seemed to be just a young man who had just gone through twenty summers, hardly older, if indeed older at all, compared to his sister when they parted many years ago.</t4953> <t4954>Clearly, this was not the person who had ruined his sister's life.</t4954>
<t4955>He loosened his grip and staggered back. "Oh my God! Oh my God!" he shouted, "I almost killed you!"</t4955>
<t4956>Dorian Gray took a deep breath.</t4956> <t4957>"You almost committed a terrible crime, my friend," he said, looking at him sternly.</t4957> <t4958>"Let this be a lesson to you not to take revenge into your own hands."</t4958>
<t4959>“Forgive me, sir,” James Vane whispered.</t4959> <t4960>“I was deceived.</t4960> <t4961>A chance word I overheard in that wretched den led me astray.”</t4961>
<t4962>"You should go home, and put that gun away, or else you might get into trouble," Dorian said, turning on his heel, and slowly walked down the street.</t4962>
<t4963>James Vane stood on the sidewalk, terrified.</t4963> <t4964>He was trembling from head to toe.</t4964> <t4965>A moment later, a shadow crept along the drenched wall, moving into the light and approaching him with stealthy steps.</t4965> <t4966>He felt a hand placed on his arm and started, looking around.</t4966> <t4967>It was one of the women who had been drinking at the bar.</t4967>
<t4968>“Why didn't you kill it?” She hissed, bringing her gaunt face close to his.</t4968> <t4969>“I know you followed it when you rushed out of Daly.</t4969> <t4970>You are so stupid! You should have killed it.</t4970> <t4971>It has a lot of money, and it is truly evil.”</t4971>
<t4972>“He is not the person I am looking for,” he replied, “and I do not need anyone's money.</t4972> <t4973>I need a person's life.</t4973> <t4974>The person whose life I want to take must be nearly forty by now.</t4974> <t4975>But this one is just a little older than a boy. Thank God, I did not let my hands be stained with his blood.”</t4975>
<t4976>The woman laughed bitterly.</t4976> <t4977>“Only a little older than a boy!” she sneered. “Why, my dear, it has been nearly eighteen years since Prince Charming made me this way.”</t4977>
<t4978>“You are lying!” James Vane shouted.</t4978>
<t4979>She raised her hand to the sky.</t4979> <t4980>"I swear before God, I have told the truth," she exclaimed.</t4980>
<t4981>“Swear before God?”</t4981>
<t4982>“Strike me dumb if it isn't so.</t4982> <t4983>He is the worst one ever to come here.</t4983> <t4984>They say he sold his soul to the devil for a handsome face.</t4984> <t4985>It's been nearly eighteen years since I met him.</t4985> <t4986>He hasn't changed much since then.</t4986> <t4987>Though I have,” she added, with a miserable glance.</t4987>
<t4988>“Do you swear?”</t4988>
<t4989>“I swear,” the hoarse repetition came from her thin, pinched mouth.</t4989> <t4990>“But don't tell on me to it,” she moaned; “I'm very afraid of it.</t4990> <t4991>Give me some money to pay for tonight's lodging.”</t4991>
<t4992>He cursed and left her, rushing to the corner of the street, but Dorian Gray had disappeared.</t4992> <t4993>When he looked back, the woman was also no longer there.</t4993>
<t4994>Chapter 17</t4994>
<t4995>One week later, Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby Royal estate and conversing with the beautiful Duchess of Monmouth, she and her husband, a weary-looking man in his sixties, were his guests.</t4995> <t4996>It was tea time, and the gentle light from the large lace-covered lamp on the table illuminated the exquisite porcelain and the hammered silver of the tea set at the party hosted by the duchess.</t4996> <t4997>Her delicate white hands fluttered gracefully among the cups, and her full red lips smiled at something Dorian whispered in her ear.</t4997> <t4998>Lord Henry lay back on a silk-covered wicker chair and watched them.</t4998> <t4999>On the peach-colored sofa, Mrs. Narborough sat pretending to listen to the duke describe the latest Brazilian beetle he had added to his collection.</t4999> <t5000>Three young men in elaborate smoking attire were serving pastries and tea to several women.</t5000> <t5001>The group of guests staying at the house comprised twelve people, and hopefully more would arrive tomorrow.</t5001>
<t5002>"What are you two talking about?" Lord Henry said, strolling leisurely towards the table and setting down his cup.</t5002> <t5003>"I hope Dorian has told you about my plan to rename everything, Gladys.</t5003> <t5004>It's an interesting idea."</t5004>
<t5005>“But I don't want to be renamed, Harry,” the duchess retorted, looking up at him with her beautiful eyes.</t5005> <t5006>“I am very satisfied with my name, and I am sure that Mr. Gray is also satisfied with his.”</t5006>
<t5007>“Dear Gladys, I would never change your names.</t5007> <t5008>Both names are already perfect.</t5008> <t5009>I am mainly thinking about flowers.</t5009> <t5010>Yesterday I cut an orchid to wear in my buttonhole.</t5010> <t5011>It was a marvelous, mottled thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins.</t5011> <t5012>In a moment of carelessness, I asked a gardener what it was called.</t5012> <t5013>He told me it was a beautiful specimen of Robinsoniana, or some other dreadful name like that.</t5013> <t5014>It is a sad truth, but we have lost the ability to give lovely names to things.</t5014> <t5015>Names are everything.</t5015> <t5016>I never complain about actions.</t5016> <t5017>My only complaint is about words.</t5017> <t5018>That is why I hate the vulgar realism in literature.</t5018> <t5019>Anyone who can call a spade a spade should be made to use it.</t5019> <t5020>It is the only thing suitable for him.”</t5020>
<t5021>"So what should we call you, Harry?" she asked.</t5021>
<t5022>“His name is the Contrary Prince,” Dorian said.</t5022>
<t5023>“I recognized him immediately,” the duchess exclaimed.</t5023>
<t5024>“I will not agree,” Lord Henry laughed, lowering himself into the chair.</t5024> <t5025>“Once the label is attached, it cannot be escaped!</t5025> <t5026>I refuse this title.”</t5026>
<t5027>“Princes cannot abdicate,” slipped out as a warning from her lovely lips.</t5027> <t5028>“So you want me to keep the throne, don't you?”</t5028>
<t5029>“Yes.</t5029><t5030>”</t5030>
<t5031>“I will reveal the truths of tomorrow.</t5031><t5032>”</t5032>
<t5033>“I prefer today's mistakes,” she replied.</t5033> <t5034>“You've stripped me of all my weapons, Gladys,” he exclaimed, catching on to her stubborn temperament.</t5034>
<t5035>"Take off the shield, Harry: not the spear."</t5035><t5036>"</t5036>
<t5037>“I never poke a spear at Beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.</t5037>
<t5038>“It is your fault, Harry, believe me.</t5038> <t5039>You overestimate beauty too much.”</t5039>
<t5040>“How can you say that?</t5040> <t5041>I admit that I think being beautiful is better than being obedient.</t5041> <t5042>But on the other hand, no one is more willing to acknowledge than I am that being obedient is better than being ugly.”</t5042>
<t5043>“So, is ugliness one of the seven deadly sins?” the duchess exclaimed. “What happened to your smile about the orchids?”</t5043>
<t5044>“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys.</t5044> <t5045>You, as a loyal member of the Conservative party, should not underestimate them.</t5045> <t5046>Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly virtues have made our England what it is.”</t5046>
<t5047>“So, you don't like our country?” she asked.</t5047>
<t5048>“I live in it.”</t5048>
<t5049>"So that he can criticize it better."</t5049>
<t5050>"Do you really want me to accept Europe's opinion about it?" he asked back.</t5050>
<t5051>“What are they saying about me?”</t5051>
<t5052>“It was Hypocrisy who emigrated to England and opened a shop.”</t5052>
<t5053>“Your story, Harry?”</t5053>
<t5054>“I give it to you.”</t5054>
<t5055>“I can't use it.</t5055> <t5056>It's too accurate.”</t5056>
<t5057>"You don't have to worry."</t5057> <t5058>"My compatriots will never recognize any description."</t5058>
<t5059>“They are practical.</t5059><t5060>”</t5060>
<t5061>“They are more cunning than practical.</t5061> <t5062>When they create a ledger, they balance stupidity with wealth, and depravity with hypocrisy.”</t5062>
<t5063>“However, I have done many great things.</t5063><t5064>”</t5064>
<t5065>"Great things have been impressed upon us, Gladys."</t5065>
<t5066>“We have borne their burdens.”</t5066>
<t5067>“Only as far as the stock exchange.”</t5067> <t5068>She shook her head. “I believe in the race,” she shouted.</t5068>
<t5069>“It symbolizes the remnants of self-assertion.</t5069><t5070>”</t5070>
<t5071>“It has development.</t5071><t5072>”</t5072>
<t5073>“The decline fascinates me more.”</t5073>
<t5074>“What about Art?” she asked.</t5074> <t5075>“It is a disease.</t5075><t5076>”</t5076>
<t5077>“Love?”</t5077>
<t5078>“An illusion.</t5078><t5079>”</t5079>
<t5080>“Religion?”</t5080>
<t5081>"The fashionable substitute for Faith."</t5081>
<t5082>“You are a skeptic.</t5082><t5083>”</t5083>
<t5084>"Not at all! Skepticism is the root of faith.</t5084><t5085>"</t5085>
<t5086>"Who are you?"</t5086>
<t5087>"To define is to limit."</t5087><t5088>"</t5088>
<t5089>"Give me a lead."</t5089>
<t5090>“Just broken.</t5090> <t5091>You will get lost in the maze.</t5091><t5092>”</t5092>
<t5093>"You make me confused.</t5093> <t5094>Let's talk about someone else.</t5094><t5095>"</t5095>
<t5096>“Our host is an interesting subject.</t5096> <t5097>Many years ago, he was named Prince Charming.”</t5097>
<t5098>“Oh! Don't remind me of that,” Dorian Gray exclaimed.</t5098>
<t5099>“Our host this afternoon was quite unpleasant,” the duchess replied, blushing.</t5099> <t5100>“I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me based on purely scientific principles, like the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly.”</t5100>
<t5101>"Is that so? I hope he doesn't stick a pin in you, Duchess," Dorian laughed.</t5101>
<t5102>"Oh! My servant did that, Mr. Gray, when he was angry with me."</t5102>
<t5103>"So why is he angry with you, Duchess?"</t5103>
<t5104>"For the most trivial matters, Mr. Gray, I assure you.</t5104> <t5105>Usually because I arrive at ten to nine and tell him that I must be dressed by half past eight."</t5105>
<t5106>“How unreasonable it is! You have to warn her.”</t5106>
<t5107>“I don't dare, Mr. Gray.</t5107> <t5108>Because, she makes hats for me.</t5108> <t5109>Do you remember the one I wore at Mrs. Hilstone's garden party?</t5109> <t5110>You don't remember, but you are so kind to pretend that you do.</t5110> <t5111>Well, she made that hat out of nothing.</t5111> <t5112>All beautiful hats are made out of nothing.”</t5112>
<t5113>“Like all reputations, Gladys,” Lord Henry interrupted.</t5113> <t5114>“Every impression we create brings us an enemy.</t5114> <t5115>To be liked by everyone, we must be a mediocre person.</t5115><t5116>”</t5116>
<t5117>“Not with women,” the duchess said, shaking her head; “and women rule the world.</t5117> <t5118>I assure you that we cannot stand ordinary people.</t5118> <t5119>We women, as someone said, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, that is, assuming you ever know how to love at all.”</t5119>
<t5120>“It seems like we never do anything else, do we?” Dorian whispered.</t5120>
<t5121>"Oh! Then you have never truly loved, Mr. Gray," the duchess replied, appearing sorrowful.</t5121>
<t5122>“My dear Gladys!” Lord Henry exclaimed. “How can you say that? Love lives on repetition, and repetition transforms desire into art.</t5122> <t5123>Moreover, each time we love is the only time we have ever loved.</t5123> <t5124>The difference in the object does not change the uniqueness of the passion.</t5124> <t5125>It only deepens it.</t5125> <t5126>We are fortunate if we can have one great experience in life, and the secret of life is to recreate that experience as often as possible.”</t5126>
<t5127>"Even if it hurts me, Harry?" the duchess asked, after a moment of hesitation.</t5127>
<t5128>“Especially when it has hurt us,” Lord Henry replied.</t5128>
<t5129>The Duchess turned to look at Dorian Gray with a curious gaze.</t5129> <t5130>“What do you say about that, Mr. Gray?” she asked.</t5130>
<t5131>Dorian hesitated for a moment.</t5131> <t5132>Then he threw his head back and laughed.</t5132> <t5133>“I always agree with Harry, Duchess.</t5133><t5134>”</t5134>
<t5135>"Even if he is wrong?"</t5135>
<t5136>“Harry is never wrong, madam duchess.</t5136><t5137>”</t5137>
<t5138>“Does his philosophy make you happy?”</t5138>
<t5139>“I have never sought happiness.</t5139> <t5140>Who needs happiness?</t5140> <t5141>I seek joy.”</t5141>
<t5142>"And have you found it yet, Mr. Gray?"</t5142>
<t5143>“Too often.</t5143> <t5144>Far too often.”</t5144>
<t5145>The Duchess sighed.</t5145> <t5146>“I seek peace,” she said, “and if I don't go change my clothes, I won't have any this afternoon.”</t5146>
<t5147>"Let me get you some orchids, Duchess," Dorian exclaimed, jumping up, and heading down to the greenhouse.</t5147>
<t5148>"She flirts with him so shamelessly," Lord Henry said to his cousin.</t5148> <t5149>"You should be more careful.</t5149> <t5150>He is very charming."</t5150>
<t5151>"If he wasn't like that, he wouldn't have had to fight."</t5151>
<t5152>“So, it's Greeks fighting Greeks, huh?”</t5152>
<t5153>“I am with Troy.</t5153> <t5154>They fight for a woman.”</t5154>
<t5155>"They were defeated."</t5155>
<t5156>“There are things worse than being caught,” she replied.</t5156>
<t5157>“She gallops with the loose reins.</t5157><t5158>”</t5158>
<t5159>"The trot brings life," was the reply.</t5159>
<t5160>“I will write it in my diary tonight.”</t5160>
<t5161>"What?"</t5161>
<t5162>“As a child who was burned but still loves fire.”</t5162>
<t5163>“I wasn't even singed.</t5163> <t5164>My wings are intact.</t5164><t5165>”</t5165>
<t5166>“She uses it for everything, except flying.”</t5166>
<t5167>"Courage has shifted from men to women.</t5167> <t5168>This is a new experience for us.</t5168><t5169>"</t5169>
<t5170>"You have a rival."</t5170>
<t5171>"Huh?"</t5171>
<t5172>He smiled.</t5172> <t5173>“Mrs. Narborough,” he whispered. “She is extremely fond of him.”</t5173>
<t5174>"You scare me.</t5174> <t5175>The attraction to antiques is very harmful to romantics like us."</t5175>
<t5176>“Romantics! You have all the scientific methods.</t5176><t5177>”</t5177>
<t5178>“Men have taught us.”</t5178>
<t5179>“But not explaining to you ladies.”</t5179>
<t5180>“Describe us as a gender, then,” was her challenge.</t5180>
<t5181>“The Sphynx cats have no secrets.”</t5181>
<t5182>She looked at him, smiling. "Mr. Gray, it's been so long!" she said.</t5182> <t5183>"Let's go help him."</t5183> <t5184>"I still haven't told him the color of my dress."</t5184>
<t5185>"Ah! You have to choose a dress that matches his flowers, Gladys."</t5185>
<t5186>“That would be too early of a surrender.”</t5186>
<t5187>“Romantic art begins with the climax.”</t5187>
<t5188>“I must keep an opportunity to retreat.”</t5188>
<t5189>"In the Parthian style?"</t5189>
<t5190>“They feel safe in the desert.</t5190> <t5191>I cannot do that.”</t5191>
<t5192>“Women are not always allowed to choose,” he replied, but just as he finished his sentence, a stifled groan echoed from the end of the greenhouse, followed by the dull thud of a heavy fall.</t5192> <t5193>Everyone sprang up.</t5193> <t5194>The duchess stood motionless in fear.</t5194> <t5195>And with worry in his eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the swaying palm leaves to find Dorian Gray lying face down on the tiled floor in a deathlike faint.</t5195>
<t5196>You were immediately carried into the blue living room and placed on a sofa.</t5196> <t5197>After a short while, you regained consciousness and looked around with a bewildered expression.</t5197>
<t5198>“What happened?” he asked.</t5198> <t5199>“Oh! I remember now.</t5199> <t5200>Am I safe here, Harry?” He began to tremble.</t5200>
<t5201>“My dear Dorian,” Lord Henry replied, “you just fainted.</t5201> <t5202>That's all.</t5202> <t5203>You must have overworked yourself.</t5203> <t5204>It would be better if you didn't come down for dinner.</t5204> <t5205>I'll take your place.”</t5205>
<t5206>"No, I will go downstairs," he said, struggling to stand up.</t5206> <t5207>"I prefer going downstairs.</t5207> <t5208>I shouldn't be alone.</t5208><t5209>"</t5209>
<t5210>You went into your room and changed clothes.</t5210> <t5211>There was a careless abandon in your cheerful demeanor as you sat by the table, but occasionally a shudder of fear ran through you when you remembered that, pressed against the greenhouse window like a white handkerchief, you had seen James Vane's face looking at you.</t5211>
<t5212>Chapter 18</t5212>
<t5213>The next day, he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the time in his own room, falling ill from the fear of going mad, yet indifferent to life itself.</t5213> <t5214>The awareness of being hunted, trapped, watched, and caught began to dominate him.</t5214> <t5215>Whenever the embroidered carpet fluttered in the wind, he would tremble.</t5215> <t5216>He felt as if the dead leaves blown against the leaded glass panes were like his wasted decisions and his wild regrets.</t5216> <t5217>When he closed his eyes, he saw the face of that sailor peering through the misted glass, and the horror seemed to lay its hand on his heart once more.</t5217>
<t5218>But, perhaps it is only your imagination that calls forth vengeance from the night, and places the grotesque form of punishment before you.</t5218> <t5219>Real life is indeed chaotic, but there is also a terrifying logic in imagination.</t5219> <t5220>It is imagination that makes remorse cling to the heels of guilt.</t5220> <t5221>It is imagination that makes every crime carry its own deformed offspring.</t5221> <t5222>In the ordinary real world, evil is not punished, nor is good rewarded.</t5222> <t5223>Success is offered to the strong, failure is stamped on the weak.</t5223> <t5224>That's all.</t5224> <t5225>Moreover, if any stranger were lurking around the house, he would likely be caught by the servants or guards.</t5225> <t5226>If any footprints were found in the flower beds, the gardeners would have reported it.</t5227> <t5227>Yes: it is only imagination.</t5227> <t5228>Sibyl Vane's brother did not come back to kill you.</t5228> <t5229>He boarded a ship to some distant winter sea.</t5229> <t5230>In any case, you are certainly not under attack by him.</t5230> <t5231>Why, someone who doesn't know who you are cannot know who you are.</t5231> <t5232>The mask of youth has saved you.</t5232>
<t5233>However, if it is just an illusion, it is truly terrifying to think that the conscience could conjure up such dreadful phantoms, give them a clear form, and make them move before one's eyes!</t5233> <t5234>What kind of life would you have if day and night, your guilty shadows kept peering at you from silent corners, mocking you from secret places, whispering in your ear while you sit at feasts, waking you with icy fingers as you sleep! As that thought slithered through your mind, you turned pale with fear, and it seemed as if the air suddenly grew colder.</t5234> <t5235>Oh! How you killed your friend in a moment of madness!</t5235> <t5236>Even the memory of that scene is horrifying!</t5236> <t5237>You see it all again.</t5237> <t5238>Every gruesome detail returns to you with added horror.</t5238> <t5239>Out of the dark cave of Time, terrible and wrapped in bright red bandages, your sinful image rises.</t5239> <t5240>When Lord Henry arrived at six o'clock, he found you crying like someone with a heart about to break.</t5240>
<t5241>It wasn't until Tuesday that he finally dared to step outside.</t5241> <t5242>There was something in the fresh, pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring back to him the joy and zest for life.</t5242> <t5243>But it wasn't just the natural conditions of the surrounding environment that caused the change.</t5243> <t5244>His own nature had also risen up against the excess of the anguish that kept trying to destroy the perfection of the calmness that belonged to it.</t5244> <t5245>It is always so with those who have a delicate and finely tuned temperament.</t5245> <t5246>Their strong passions must be distorted or bent.</t5246> <t5247>They either kill or die themselves.</t5247> <t5248>Shallow sorrows and shallow loves continue to live on.</t5248> <t5249>Great loves and great sorrows are destroyed by their own fullness.</t5249> <t5250>Moreover, he convinced himself that he was the victim of an imagination influenced by terror, and now looked back at his fears with something like pity and great disdain.</t5250>
<t5251>After breakfast, he strolled with the duchess for about an hour in the garden, then drove through the park to join the hunting party.</t5251> <t5252>The crisp frost lay like salt on the grass.</t5252> <t5253>The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal.</t5253> <t5254>A thin layer of ice bordered the flat lake filled with reeds.</t5254>
<t5255>At the corner of the pine forest, he glimpsed Mr. Geoffrey Clouston, the duke's brother, forcefully pulling two spent shells out of his gun.</t5255> <t5256>He jumped out of the car, and after instructing the stable hand to take the mare back home, he headed towards his guest through the withered bracken ferns and the tangled underbrush.</t5256>
<t5257>"Did you have fun, Geoffrey?" he asked.</t5257>
<t5258>"Not very happy, Dorian.</t5258> <t5259>I think most of the birds have flown to the desolate fields.</t5259> <t5260>I dare say it will be more enjoyable after lunch, when we reach the new land.</t5260><t5261>"</t5261>
<t5262>Dorian walked beside him.</t5262> <t5263>The air was fragrant, red and brown light flickered in the forest, the hoarse cries of the beaters occasionally rang out, followed by the sharp clatter of guns, enchanting him, and filling him with a sense of joyful freedom. He was completely dominated by a careless happiness, by an overwhelming sense of euphoric detachment.</t5263>
<t5264>Suddenly, from the old, scraggly bushes, about twenty yards in front of them, with black-tipped ears standing upright and long hind legs pushing its body forward, a hare abruptly appeared.</t5264> <t5265>It fled into a thicket of brambles.</t5265> <t5266>Sir Geoffrey raised his gun to his shoulder, but something about the grace of the animal in motion strangely captivated Dorian Gray, and he immediately shouted, “Don’t shoot it, Geoffrey.</t5266> <t5267>Let it live.”</t5267>
<t5268>“That's nonsense, Dorian!” his friend laughed, and as the rabbit leaped into the bush, he fired.</t5268> <t5269>There were two cries: the cry of the rabbit in pain, very frightening, and the cry of a person in their death throes, even more terrifying.</t5269>
<t5270>“Oh my God! I shot a beater!” Sir Geoffrey shouted.</t5270> <t5271>“What kind of fool would walk right into the line of fire! Stop shooting over there!” he yelled at the top of his lungs.</t5271> <t5272>“Someone is injured.</t5272><t5273>”</t5273>
<t5274>The forest guard leader ran over with a stick in his hand.</t5274>
<t5275>"Where, sir?"</t5275> <t5276>"Where is it?" he shouted.</t5276> <t5277>At the same time, the shooting stopped all along the line.</t5277>
<t5278>“Here,” Sir Geoffrey replied angrily, hurrying towards the bushes.</t5278> <t5279>“Good heavens, why didn't you keep your men behind?</t5279> <t5280>You've ruined my entire hunting day.”</t5280>
<t5281>Dorian watched them as they rushed into the thicket, brushing aside the soft, swaying branches.</t5281> <t5282>A moment later, they emerged, dragging a corpse out into the sunlight.</t5282> <t5283>He turned away in fear.</t5283> <t5284>He felt as if misfortune followed him wherever he went.</t5284> <t5285>He heard Sir Geoffrey question whether the person was truly dead, and the ranger's affirmative response.</t5285> <t5286>He felt as if the forest suddenly became teeming with faces.</t5286> <t5287>There was the trampling sound of thousands of feet, and the soft murmur of voices.</t5287> <t5288>A giant copper-breasted pheasant flew through the branches overhead.</t5288>
<t5289>After a few minutes that, in his agitated state, felt like endless hours of pain, he felt a hand placed on his shoulder.</t5289> <t5290>He started and looked around.</t5290>
<t5291>"Dorian," Lord Henry said, "I should tell them that the hunt should stop today."</t5291> <t5292>"It doesn't seem very appropriate to continue."</t5292>
<t5293>"I hope it stops forever, Harry," he replied, bitterly.</t5293> <t5294>"This whole thing is disgusting and cruel.</t5294> <t5295>That person has..."</t5295>
<t5296>You couldn't finish the sentence.</t5296>
<t5297>“I’m afraid so,” Lord Henry replied. “He took all the bullets to the chest.</t5297> <t5298>He must have died almost instantly.</t5298> <t5299>Come; let’s go home.”</t5299>
<t5300>They walked side by side along the path under the trees for about fifty meters without saying a word.</t5300> <t5301>Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said, with a heavy sigh, "It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen."</t5301>
<t5302>“What do you mean?” Lord Henry asked. “Oh! This accident, huh.</t5302> <t5303>My friend, it's hopeless.</t5303> <t5304>It was his own fault.</t5304> <t5305>Why did he get right in front of the gun?</t5305> <t5306>Besides, it has nothing to do with us.</t5306> <t5307>It's quite a hassle for Geoffrey, of course.</t5307> <t5308>Shooting at the person driving the game is really not okay at all.</t5308> <t5309>It makes people think he's a reckless shooter.</t5309> <t5310>But Geoffrey isn't like that; he's a very accurate shooter.</t5310> <t5311>But talking about this is pointless.”</t5311>
<t5312>Dorian shook his head. "That is a bad point, Harry.</t5312> <t5313>I feel as if something terrible is about to happen to one of us.</t5313> <t5314>To myself, perhaps," he added, brushing his hand across his eyes with a pained expression.</t5314>
<t5315>The older person laughed.</t5315> <t5316>“The only terrible thing in this world is boredom, Dorian.</t5316> <t5317>It is an unforgivable sin.</t5317> <t5318>But surely we don't have to endure it, unless those friends of ours keep babbling about it at dinner.</t5318> <t5319>I must tell them that this topic is forbidden.</t5319> <t5320>As for omens, there is no such thing as an omen.</t5320> <t5321>Fate does not send messengers to us.</t5321> <t5322>In this regard, she is either too wise or too cruel.</t5322> <t5323>Besides, what on earth could possibly happen to you, Dorian? You have everything a person could need.</t5323> <t5324>No one would be unwilling to trade places with you.”</t5324>
<t5325>“There is no one I wouldn't want to trade places with, Harry.</t5325> <t5326>Don't laugh like that. I'm telling you the truth.</t5326> <t5327>Even that poor farmer who just died is happier than I am.</t5327> <t5328>I'm not afraid of Death.</t5328> <t5329>It's the approach of Death that terrifies me.</t5329> <t5330>Its enormous wings seem to be circling in the leaden gray air around me.</t5330> <t5331>Oh my God! Do you see someone moving behind those trees over there, watching me, waiting for me?”</t5331>
<t5332>Lord Henry looked in the direction the trembling gloved hand was pointing. "Yes," he said with a smile, "I see the gardener waiting for you.</t5332> <t5333>I suppose he needs to ask you which flowers you want on the table tonight.</t5333> <t5334>Why are you so unreasonably anxious, my friend! You must see my doctor when we return to the city."</t5334>
<t5335>Dorian breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the gardener approaching.</t5335> <t5336>The gardener touched his hat, glanced hesitantly at Lord Henry, then took out a letter and handed it to his master.</t5336> <t5337>“The lady told me to wait for a reply,” he whispered.</t5337>
<t5338>Dorian put the letter in his pocket. "Tell her I am coming immediately," he said coldly.</t5338> <t5339>The servant turned away and walked quickly towards the house.</t5339>
<t5340>“Why do women like to do such dangerous things!” Lord Henry laughed.</t5340> <t5341>“That is one of the qualities in them that I admire the most.</t5341> <t5342>Women will flirt with anyone in the world as long as others are paying attention.”</t5342>
<t5343>“Why do you like to say such dangerous things, Harry!</t5343> <t5344>In this case, you are greatly mistaken.</t5344> <t5345>I like the duchess very much, but I do not love her.”</t5345>
<t5346>“As for the duchess, she loves you very much, but she doesn't like you as much, so you two are extremely well-matched.</t5346><t5347>”</t5347>
<t5348>"You're making things up, Harry, without any basis for it."</t5348><t5349>"</t5349>
<t5350>“The basis of all scandal is an unwavering belief in some form of immorality,” Lord Henry said, lighting a cigarette.</t5350>
<t5351>“You would probably sacrifice anyone, Harry, for a witty remark.</t5351><t5352>”</t5352>
<t5353>“People willingly go to the altar,” was the answer.</t5353>
<t5354>“I wish I could love.” Dorian Gray exclaimed, with a deep note of emotion in his voice.</t5354> <t5355>“But I seem to have lost passion, forgotten desire.</t5355> <t5356>I am too focused on myself.</t5356> <t5357>My personality has become a burden to me.</t5357> <t5358>I want to escape, to go far away, to forget everything.</t5358> <t5359>I was so naive to come down here.</t5359> <t5360>I think I will send a telegram to Harvey to prepare the sailboat.</t5360> <t5361>On the sailboat, we will be safe.</t5361><t5362>”</t5362>
<t5363>"Safe with what, Dorian?</t5363> <t5364>You seem to be unhappy about something.</t5364> <t5365>Why don't you tell me what it is?</t5365> <t5366>You know I will help you."</t5366>
<t5367>"I can't tell you, Harry," he replied, sadly. "And I dare say it is just my imagination.</t5367> <t5368>This unfortunate accident worries me.</t5368> <t5369>I have a terrible feeling that something like this might happen to me."</t5369>
<t5370>"Nonsense!"</t5370>
<t5371>"I hope so, but I can't help feeling it."</t5371> <t5372>"Ah! Here comes the Duchess, looking like Artemis in a tailored gown."</t5372> <t5373>"You see, we have returned, Duchess."</t5373>
<t5374>“I heard everything, Mr. Gray,” she replied.</t5374> <t5375>“Poor Geoffrey is very worried.</t5375> <t5376>And it seems that you asked him not to shoot that hare.</t5376> <t5377>How strange!”</t5377>
<t5378>“That's right, very strange.</t5378> <t5379>I don't know what made me say that.</t5379> <t5380>Some sudden thought, I think.</t5380> <t5381>It's like the cutest little creature.</t5381> <t5382>But I'm sorry they told you about that person.</t5382> <t5383>It's a disgusting subject.”</t5383>
<t5384>“That is an unpleasant topic,” Lord Henry interrupted.</t5384> <t5385>“It has no psychological value at all.</t5385> <t5386>Now, suppose Geoffrey had deliberately done it, how interesting he would be!</t5386> <t5387>I would love to know someone who has actually committed a real murder.</t5387><t5388>”</t5388>
<t5389>“Why are you being so unreasonable, Harry!” the duchess exclaimed. “Isn't that right, Mr. Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is sick again.</t5389> <t5390>He's about to faint.”</t5390>
<t5391>Dorian tried to stand up straight and laughed.</t5391> <t5392>“It's nothing, Duchess,” he muttered; “my nerves are terribly upset.</t5392> <t5393>That's all.</t5393> <t5394>I'm afraid I walked too far this morning.</t5394> <t5395>I didn't hear what Harry said.</t5395> <t5396>Was it very bad?</t5396> <t5397>You must tell me another time.</t5397> <t5398>I think I must lie down.</t5398> <t5399>You will forgive me, won't you?”</t5399>
<t5400>They reached the wide staircase leading from the conservatory to the terrace.</t5400> <t5401>As the glass door closed behind Dorian, Lord Henry turned to look at the duchess with dreamy eyes.</t5401> <t5402>“Do you love it very much?” he asked.</t5402>
<t5403>She didn't respond for a moment, just stood looking at the scenery.</t5403> <t5404>"I wish I knew," she finally said.</t5404>
<t5405>Y shook his head. "Knowing clearly only harms.</t5405> <t5406>Being vague is more attractive.</t5406> <t5407>The fog makes things magical."</t5407>
<t5408>“Could be lost.</t5408><t5409>”</t5409>
<t5410>"All roads end at the same point, Gladys."</t5410>
<t5411>"What is it?"</t5411>
<t5412>“Disillusioned.</t5412><t5413>”</t5413>
<t5414>“That was also my debut into life,” she sighed.</t5414> <t5415>“It came to you wearing a crown.</t5415><t5416>”</t5416>
<t5417>"I am tired of mulberry leaves."</t5417>
<t5418>1 Duke's row (on the hat decorated with a strawberry leaf.)</t5418>
<t5419>“They suit you.</t5419><t5420>”</t5420>
<t5421>“Only when public.</t5421><t5422>”</t5422>
<t5423>“She will miss them,” Lord Henry said.</t5423>
<t5424>“I will not pluck any petals.”</t5424>
<t5425>"Monmouth has ears."</t5425>
<t5426>“Old age is hard of hearing.</t5426><t5427>”</t5427>
<t5428>“Has he ever been jealous?”</t5428>
<t5429>“I wish he had.</t5429><t5430>”</t5430>
<t5431>He looked around as if searching for something.</t5431> <t5432>“What are you looking for?” she asked.</t5432>
<t5433>“The pommel of your sword,” he replied.</t5433> <t5434>“You dropped it.”</t5434>
<t5435>She burst out laughing.</t5435> <t5436>"I still have the mask."</t5436>
<t5437>“It makes your eyes more beautiful,” was his response.</t5437>
<t5438>She laughed again.</t5438> <t5439>Her teeth appeared like white seeds in a persimmon.</t5439>
<t5440>Upstairs, in his private room, Dorian Gray was lying on the sofa, with terror tingling in every fiber of his being.</t5440> <t5441>Life had suddenly become an unbearably loathsome burden for him to carry.</t5441> <t5442>The terrible death of the unlucky animal trainer, shot in the bushes like a wild beast, made him feel as if it was a foretelling of his own demise.</t5442> <t5443>He nearly fainted at what Lord Henry said in a mood of bitter jest.</t5443>
<t5444>At five o'clock, he rang the bell to call the servant and ordered him to pack his belongings for the night express train to the city, and to arrange for a one-horse carriage at the door at half-past eight.</t5444> <t5445>He was determined not to spend another night at Selby Royal.</t5445> <t5446>It was a place of ominous signs. Death walked there in the sunlight.</t5446> <t5447>The grass in the forest was stained with blood.</t5447>
<t5448>Then he wrote a short letter to Lord Henry, telling him that he was returning to the city to see a doctor, and asking him to entertain guests in his absence.</t5448> <t5449>As he was putting the letter into an envelope, there was a knock on the door, and his servant informed him that the head forester wished to see him.</t5449> <t5450>He frowned, biting his lip.</t5450> <t5451>"Let him in," he muttered, after a moment's hesitation.</t5451>
<t5452>As soon as the person entered, Dorian pulled the checkbook out of the drawer and laid it out in front of him.</t5452>
<t5453>"I suppose you are here about the unfortunate accident this morning, aren't you Thornton?" he said, picking up a pen.</t5453>
<t5454>“Yes, sir,” the ranger replied.</t5454>
<t5455>“Does that poor fellow have a wife?”</t5455> <t5456>“Does he have anyone dependent on him?” Dorian asked, looking very sad.</t5456> <t5457>“If so, I wouldn't want them to be left in poverty, and I will send them whatever amount of money you think is necessary.</t5457><t5458>”</t5458>
<t5459>"We don't know who he is, sir."</t5459>
<t5460>That is the reason I took the liberty to come see you.</t5460><t5461>"</t5461>
<t5462>“Don't know who he is?” Dorian asked, indifferently. “What do you mean?</t5462> <t5463>Isn't he your man?”</t5463>
<t5464>“No, sir.</t5464> <t5465>I have never seen him before.</t5465> <t5466>He seems to be a sailor, sir.”</t5466>
<t5467>The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, he felt as if his heart had suddenly stopped beating. "A sailor?" he exclaimed. "Did you say a sailor?"</t5467>
<t5468>"Yes, sir."</t5468> <t5469>"He looks like he might have been a sailor; tattoos on both arms, and that sort of thing."</t5469>
<t5470>“Did you find anything on him?” Dorian said, leaning forward and looking at the person with startled eyes.</t5470> <t5471>“Anything that could tell us his name?”</t5471>
<t5472>“A little money, sir — not much, and a revolver.</t5472> <t5473>No identification at all.</t5473> <t5474>A person who seemed respectable, sir, but somewhat rough.</t5474> <t5475>A sailor, we think.”</t5475>
<t5476>Dorian stood up abruptly.</t5476> <t5477>A terrible hope fluttered across him.</t5477> <t5478>He desperately grasped at it.</t5478> <t5479>“Where is the body?” he shouted. “Quick! I must see it immediately.”</t5479>
<t5480>“It is in an empty stable at the Family Farm, sir.</t5480> <t5481>People don't like to keep that kind of thing in the house.</t5481> <t5482>They say dead bodies bring bad luck.”</t5482>
<t5483>“Family Farm! Go there immediately and pick me up.</t5483> <t5484>Tell a stable hand to bring my horse here.</t5484> <t5485>No.</t5485> <t5486>Never mind.</t5486> <t5487>I will go to the stable myself.</t5487> <t5488>That will save time.</t5488><t5489>”</t5489>
<t5490>In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray galloped down the long road under the trees, trying to run as fast as he could.</t5490> <t5491>The trees seemed to sweep past him in a ghostly procession, and wild shadows flung themselves across his path.</t5491> <t5492>Once the mare swerved at a white gatepost and nearly threw him off.</t5492> <t5493>He lashed its neck with the whip.</t5493> <t5494>It cut through the dim air like an arrow.</t5494> <t5495>Stones flew from its hooves.</t5495>
<t5496>Finally, you arrived at the Family Farm.</t5496> <t5497>Two men were wandering in the yard.</t5497> <t5498>You jumped off the saddle and threw the reins to one of them.</t5498> <t5499>In the farthest stable, a light flickered.</t5499> <t5500>Something seemed to tell you that the body was there, and you hurriedly ran to the door, placing your hand on the latch.</t5500>
<t5501>There, he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the verge of a discovery that could either make or break his life.</t5501> <t5502>Then he pushed the door open and stepped inside.</t5502>
<t5503>On a pile of fabric for making sacks in the far corner, a human corpse was lying, dressed in a coarse shirt and blue pants.</t5503> <t5504>A spotted handkerchief was placed across the face.</t5504> <t5505>A crude candle, stuck in a bottle, sizzled beside it.</t5505>
<t5506>Dorian Gray shuddered.</t5506> <t5507>He felt that he could not take out the handkerchief himself, and loudly called a tenant over to him.</t5507>
<t5508>"Take that off your face.</t5508> <t5509>I want to see it," he said, grabbing the doorpost for support.</t5509>
<t5510>When the tenant did so, he stepped forward.</t5510> <t5511>A cry of joy escaped his lips.</t5511> <t5512>The person shot in the bushes was James Vane.</t5512>
<t5513>He stood there for a few minutes, looking at the corpse.</t5513> <t5514>When he rode the horse back home, his eyes were filled with tears, because he knew he was safe.</t5514>
<t5515>Chapter 19</t5515>
<t5516>"You told me that you would live decently, but it doesn't help at all," Lord Henry exclaimed, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled with rose water.</t5516> <t5517>"You are already perfect.</t5517> <t5518>Please, don't change.</t5518><t5519>"</t5519>
<t5520>Dorian Gray shook his head. "No, Harry, I have done too many terrible things in my life.</t5520> <t5521>I will not do any more.</t5521> <t5522>I started doing good deeds from yesterday."</t5522>
<t5523>"Where were you yesterday?"</t5523>
<t5524>"In the countryside, Harry.</t5524> <t5525>I have checked myself into a small hotel."</t5525>
<t5526>“My boy,” Lord Henry said, smiling, “anyone can be good in the countryside. There are no temptations there.</t5526> <t5527>That is why people who live outside the city are so completely uncivilized.</t5527> <t5528>Civilization is not something easily achieved.</t5528> <t5529>There are only two ways for a person to approach it.</t5529> <t5530>One is through education, the other is through corruption.</t5530> <t5531>Country folk have no opportunity for either, so they remain dull."</t5531>
<t5532>“Education and corruption,” Dorian repeated.</t5532> <t5533>“I have known a little about both.</t5533> <t5534>Now I see something that seems very terrible: we always see them together.</t5534> <t5535>Because I have my new ideal, Harry. I am going to change.</t5535> <t5536>I think I have changed.</t5536><t5537>”</t5537>
<t5538>“You haven't told me what your good deed is yet.</t5538> <t5539>Or did you just say that you have done more than one thing?” your friend asked, as he poured onto his plate a small red pyramid of hulled strawberries, and, through a perforated shell-shaped spoon, sprinkled white sugar on them like snow.</t5539>
<t5540>"I can tell you, Harry.</t5540> <t5541>It's not a story I can tell anyone else.</t5541> <t5542>I let someone go.</t5542> <t5543>It sounds presumptuous, but you understand what I mean.</t5543> <t5544>She was very beautiful, and wonderful like Sibyl Vane.</t5544> <t5545>I think that was the first thing that attracted me to her.</t5545> <t5546>You still remember Sibyl, don't you?</t5546> <t5547>It seems like such a long time ago!</t5547>
<t5548>There, Hetty is not a person of our class, of course.</t5548> <t5549>She is just a village girl.</t5549> <t5550>But I truly love her.</t5550> <t5551>I am sure that I have loved her.</t5551> <t5552>Throughout this wonderful month of May that we are enjoying, I often ran down to meet her two or three times a week.</t5552> <t5553>Yesterday she met me in a small garden.</t5553> <t5554>Apple blossoms kept falling onto her hair, and she laughed all the time.</t5554> <t5555>We planned to run away together this morning at dawn.</t5555> <t5556>Suddenly I was determined to leave her as untouched as the flower when I first saw her.”</t5556>
<t5557>"I suppose the novelty of that emotion must have given you real excitement and joy, Dorian," Lord Henry interrupted.</t5557> <t5558>"But I can finish your pastoral poem for you.</t5558> <t5559>You gave her good advice, and broke her heart.</t5559> <t5560>That is the beginning of your reformation."</t5560>
<t5561>"Harry, you are really outrageous!</t5561> <t5562>You shouldn't say such terrible things.</t5562> <t5563>Hetty's heart isn't broken.</t5563> <t5564>Of course she cried, and things like that.</t5564> <t5565>But she wasn't humiliated.</t5565> <t5566>She can live, like Perdita, in her garden of mint and marigolds."</t5566>
<t5567>1 Character in William Shakespeare's play The Winter's Tale.</t5567>
<t5568>"And lamenting the fickle Florizel," Lord Henry said with a laugh, as he leaned back in his chair. "My dear Dorian, you have the most peculiar childish nature.</t5568> <t5569>Do you think that now this girl will ever truly be satisfied with anyone of her own class again?</t5569> <t5570>I suppose she will marry one day a rough coachman or a grinning plowman.</t5570> <t5571>See, having met you, having loved you, will teach her to scorn her husband, and she will suffer.</t5571> <t5572>From a moral standpoint, I can't say I think much of your great sacrifice.</t5572> <t5573>Even to begin with, it was poor.</t5573> <t5574>Besides, how do you know that Hetty is not at this moment floating in some starlit pond, with lovely water lilies around her, like Ophelia?"</t5574>
<t5575>2 Lovers of Perdita.</t5575>
<t5576>“I can't stand this, Harry! You mock everything, then bring up the most serious tragedies.</t5576> <t5577>At this moment, I regret telling you.</t5577> <t5578>I don't care about what you say to me.</t5578> <t5579>I know I was right in doing what I did.</t5579> <t5580>Poor Hetty!</t5580> <t5581>When I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her pale face in the window, like a jasmine flower.</t5581> <t5582>Let's not talk about it anymore, and don't try to convince me that the first good thing I've done in years, the first small sacrifice I've ever known, is actually a sin.</t5582> <t5583>I want to live more kindly.</t5583> <t5584>I'm about to live more kindly.</t5584> <t5585>Tell me something about yourself.</t5585>
<t5586>What's happening in the city? I haven't been to the club for many days."</t5586>
<t5587>“Everyone is still talking about poor Basil's disappearance.</t5587><t5588>”</t5588>
<t5589>"I thought they would be tired of that by now," Dorian said, pouring himself some wine, and slightly grimacing.</t5589>
<t5590>“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and the British public really cannot endure the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months.</t5590> <t5591>However, they have been very fortunate lately.</t5591> <t5592>They had my divorce and Alan Campbell's suicide. Now they have the mysterious disappearance of an artist.</t5592> <t5593>Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the gray ulster who left for Paris on the midnight train on November ninth was poor Basil, while the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all.</t5593> <t5594>I suppose in about a fortnight they will tell us that he has been seen in San Francisco.</t5594> <t5595>It is odd, but everyone who disappears is said to be seen in San Francisco.</t5595> <t5596>It must be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.”</t5596>
<t5597>“What do you think happened to Basil?” Dorian asked, holding the Burgundy wine glass against the light, and marveling at how he could discuss this matter so calmly.</t5597>
<t5598>“I have no idea at all.</t5598> <t5599>If Basil chooses to hide himself, it’s none of my business.</t5599> <t5600>If he is dead, I don't want to think about him anymore.</t5600> <t5601>Death is the only thing that has ever scared me.</t5601> <t5602>I hate it.”</t5602>
<t5603>“Why?” the younger person said, tiredly.</t5603>
<t5604>“Because,” Lord Henry said, passing under his nose the gold-plated latticework of an open vinaigrette, “one can survive everything nowadays except that.</t5604> <t5605>Death and vulgarity are the only two things in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain.</t5605> <t5606>Let's go have coffee in the music room, Dorian.</t5606> <t5607>You must play Chopin for me.</t5607> <t5608>The man my wife ran away with was an excellent Chopin player.</t5608> <t5609>Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her.</t5609> <t5610>The house is quite lonely without her.</t5610> <t5611>Of course, married life is just a habit, a bad habit.</t5611> <t5612>But we still regret the loss of even our worst habits.</t5612> <t5613>Perhaps we regret them the most.</t5613> <t5614>They are an essential part of our character.”</t5614>
<t5615>Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table and walked to the next room, sitting down at the piano and letting his fingers wander across the black and white ivory keys.</t5615> <t5616>After the coffee was brought in, he stopped, and, looking at Lord Henry, said, "Harry, have you ever thought that Basil might have been murdered?"</t5616>
<t5617>Lord Henry yawned. "Basil is very down-to-earth, and always wears a Waterbury watch. How could he possibly have been killed?"</t5617> <t5618>He wasn't even clever enough to have enemies.</t5618> <t5619>Of course, he had an extraordinary genius for painting.</t5619> <t5620>But a person can paint like Velasquez and still be stupid. Basil was really quite dull.</t5620> <t5621>He only caught my attention once, and that was when he told me, many years ago, that he was madly in love with you, and you were the central motif in his art."</t5621>
<t5622>1 A cheap type of watch at that time.</t5622>
<t5623>“I care about Basil a lot,” Dorian said, with a note of sadness in his voice.</t5623> <t5624>“But didn't people say he was murdered</t5624><t5625>?”</t5625>
<t5626>“Oh, some newspapers mentioned it.</t5626> <t5627>I find it seems completely impossible.</t5627> <t5628>I know there are terrible places in Paris, but Basil is not the kind of person who would go there.</t5628> <t5629>He is not curious.</t5629> <t5630>That is his main weakness.”</t5630>
<t5631>“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had killed Basil?” the younger man said.</t5631> <t5632>He looked at him intently after he had finished speaking.</t5632>
<t5633>“I would say, my dear friend, that you are playing a character that does not suit you.</t5633> <t5634>All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is a crime.</t5634> <t5635>You do not have the capacity, Dorian, to commit murder.</t5635> <t5636>I apologize if I hurt your pride by saying so, but I assure you that it is the truth.</t5636> <t5637>Crime belongs exclusively to the lower classes.</t5637> <t5638>I do not blame them at all.</t5638> <t5639>I can imagine that crime to them is like art to us, merely a method of seeking new sensations.”</t5639>
<t5640>“A method to find a strange sensation? So you think that a person who has committed murder once will be able to commit the same crime again?</t5640> <t5641>Don't tell me that.”</t5641>
<t5642>“Oh! Anything can become a joy if one does it too often,” the lord exclaimed, laughing loudly. “That is one of the most important secrets of life.</t5642> <t5643>However, I can imagine that murder is always a mistake.</t5643> <t5644>One should never do anything that one cannot recount after dinner.</t5644> <t5645>But let's leave poor Basil aside.</t5645> <t5646>I wish I could believe that he met a truly romantic end as you suggested; but I cannot.</t5646> <t5647>I am sure he fell into the Seine from a bus, and that the conductor covered up the scandal.</t5647> <t5648>Yes: I suppose that was his end.</t5648> <t5649>I see him now lying on his back under that murky water with heavy barges floating above him, and long weeds tangled in his hair.</t5649> <t5650>You know, I don't think he would have produced much better work anymore.</t5650> <t5651>In the last ten years, his paintings have become very dull.”</t5651>
<t5652>Dorian let out a sigh, while Lord Henry strolled leisurely across the room and began to stroke the head of a strange Java parrot, a large gray-feathered bird with a pink tail and crest, balancing itself on a bamboo branch.</t5652> <t5653>As his sharp fingers touched it, it lowered the white membrane of its wrinkled eyelids over its glassy black eyes and began to sway back and forth.</t5653>
<t5654>“Yes,” he continued, turning around, taking a handkerchief out of his pocket; “his paintings are indeed boring.</t5654> <t5655>It seems to me that they have lost something.</t5655> <t5656>They have lost an ideal.</t5656> <t5657>When you and he were no longer close friends, he also seemed to no longer be a great artist.</t5657> <t5658>What separated you two? I suppose he bored you.</t5658> <t5659>If so, he will never forgive you.</t5659> <t5660>That is a habit that boring people tend to have.</t5660> <t5661>By the way, what happened to the wonderful painting he made for you?</t5661> <t5662>I don't think I've ever seen it since he finished it.</t5662> <t5663>Oh! I remember you told me many years ago that you sent it down to Selby, and that it got lost or stolen on the way.</t5663> <t5664>Did you never get it back?</t5664> <t5665>What a pity! It was truly a masterpiece.</t5665> <t5666>I remember I wanted to buy it.</t5666> <t5667>I wish I had it now.</t5667> <t5668>It belonged to Basil's best period.</t5668> <t5669>Since then, his work has been a strange mix of bad painting and good intentions, something that always gives one the right to call him a typical English artist.</t5669> <t5670>Did you advertise for it?</t5670> <t5671>You should.”</t5671>
<t5672>“I forgot,” Dorian said.</t5672> <t5673>“I think I did.</t5673> <t5674>But I never really liked it.</t5674> <t5675>I regret having sat for it.</t5675> <t5676>The memory of it is really unpleasant to me.</t5676> <t5677>Why do you talk about it?</t5677> <t5678>It often reminds me of those strange lines in some play —</t5678> <t5679>Hamlet, I think — how does it go?...</t5679>
<t5680>Like a sorrowful painting,</t5680>
<t5681>A heartless face.</t5681>
<t5682>Yes: it is like that."</t5682>
<t5683>Lord Henry laughed.</t5683> <t5684>"If one looks at life as an artist, his brain is his heart," he replied, lowering himself into an armchair.</t5684>
<t5685>Dorian Gray shook his head, gently striking a few chords on the piano. "Like the sorrowful painting," he repeated, "a heartless face."</t5685>
<t5686>The older man lay on his back, looking at him with half-closed eyes.</t5686> <t5687>"Ah, Dorian," he said, after a moment of hesitation, "what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses' — how is that quote written again? — 'his own soul'?"</t5687>
<t5688>The music screeched and Dorian Gray started, staring intently at his friend.</t5688> <t5689>“Why do you ask me that, Harry?”</t5689>
<t5690>“My dear friend,” Lord Henry said, raising an eyebrow in surprise, “I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.</t5690> <t5691>That's all.</t5691> <t5692>Last Sunday, I was passing through the Park, and near the Marble Arch, there was a small group of haggard-looking people listening to some mediocre street preacher.</t5692> <t5693>As I walked by, I heard him shout that question to his audience.</t5693> <t5694>It caught my attention because it was quite dramatic.</t5694> <t5695>London is very rich in such strange impressions.</t5695> <t5696>A rainy Sunday, a coarse Christian zealot in a raincoat, a circle of pale, sickly faces under the arch bobbing from waterlogged umbrellas, and a soul-stirring proclamation thrown into the air by frenzied, shrill lips — it was truly quite wonderful in its own way, a real suggestion.</t5696> <t5697>I thought about telling that prophet that Art has a soul, but man does not.</t5697> <t5698>I fear, however, that he might not have understood me.”</t5698>
<t5699>“Don't, Harry. The soul is a terrible thing that truly exists.</t5699> <t5700>It can be bought and sold.</t5700> <t5701>It can be poisoned, or made perfect.</t5701> <t5702>There is a soul in each of us.</t5702> <t5703>I know.”</t5703>
<t5704>"Do you feel certain about that, Dorian?"</t5704>
<t5705>“Sure.</t5705><t5706>”</t5706>
<t5707>"Ah! Then it must be an illusion.</t5707> <t5708>The things we are completely certain about never actually exist.</t5708> <t5709>That is the risk of Faith, the lesson of Love.</t5709> <t5710>Why are you so serious! Don't be so serious.</t5710> <t5711>What do you or I have to do with the superstitions of our age?</t5711> <t5712>No: I have abandoned my belief in the soul.</t5712> <t5713>Play something for me.</t5713> <t5714>Play a nocturne for me, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me softly how you have kept your youth.</t5714> <t5715>Surely you must have some secret.</t5715> <t5716>I am only ten years older than you, yet I am wrinkled, tired, and sallow.</t5716> <t5717>You are marvelous, Dorian.</t5717> <t5718>You have never looked more charming than you do tonight.</t5718> <t5719>You remind me of the day I first saw you.</t5719> <t5720>You were quite insolent, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary.</t5720> <t5721>You have changed, of course, but not in appearance.</t5721> <t5722>I wish you would tell me your secret.</t5722> <t5723>To be young again, I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.</t5723>
<t5724>Youth! Nothing is like it.</t5724> <t5725>It's really foolish to talk about the ignorance of youth.</t5725> <t5726>The only people whose opinions I still listen to with a bit of respect now are those much younger than me.</t5726> <t5727>They seem to be ahead of me.</t5727> <t5728>Life reveals to them its latest wonders.</t5728> <t5729>As for the old, I always have conflicts with the old.</t5729> <t5730>I do it on principle.</t5730> <t5731>If you ask their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they will solemnly tell you the prevailing opinions of 1820, when people still wore high socks, believed everything, and knew nothing.</t5731> <t5732>How lovely the thing you are playing is!</t5732> <t5733>I wonder if Chopin wrote it in Majorca, with the sea crying around the house, and salt spraying up on the window panes?</t5733> <t5734>It's extraordinarily romantic.</t5734> <t5735>How fortunate that there is still an art left to us that cannot be imitated! Don't stop.</t5735> <t5736>I need music tonight.</t5736> <t5737>I feel as if you are young Apollo, and I am Marsyas listening to you.</t5737> <t5738>I have my own sorrows, Dorian, that even you absolutely do not know.</t5738> <t5739>The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.</t5739> <t5740>I sometimes marvel at my own honesty.</t5740> <t5741>Oh, Dorian, how happy you are!</t5741> <t5742>What a wonderful life you have had!</t5742> <t5743>You have drained everything. You have crushed grapes on your palate.</t5743> <t5744>Nothing is hidden from you.</t5744> <t5745>And it is to you nothing more than music.</t5745> <t5746>It hasn't spoiled you.</t5746> <t5747>You are still the same.”</t5747>
<t5748>“I'm not like that anymore, Harry.”</t5748>
<t5749>“Right: you are still the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be like.</t5749> <t5750>Don't ruin it with abandonments.</t5750> <t5751>Right now you are a perfect model.</t5751> <t5752>Don't turn yourself into an incomplete person.</t5752> <t5753>You are now completely flawless.</t5753> <t5754>You don't need to shake your head: you know you are.</t5754> <t5755>Moreover, Dorian, don't deceive yourself.</t5755> <t5756>Life is not governed by will or purpose.</t5756> <t5757>Life is a matter of nerves, fibers, and slowly growing cells, where thought hides and passion has its own dreams.</t5757> <t5758>You may think you are safe, and believe you are strong.</t5758> <t5759>But a chance tone in a room or on the morning sky, a particular scent you once loved and that carries with it magical memories, a line from some forgotten poem that you happen to come across, a melody from a piece of music that you have stopped playing — I tell you, Dorian, that our lives depend on such things.</t5759> <t5760>Browning wrote about them somewhere; but our own emotions will imagine them for us.</t5760> <t5761>There are moments when the scent of lilas blanc1 suddenly passes by me, and I have to relive the strangest honeymoon of my life once again.</t5761> <t5762>I wish I could trade places with you, Dorian.</t5762> <t5763>People complain about both of us, but they always worship you.</t5763> <t5764>They will always worship you.</t5764> <t5765>You are the quintessential model of what this age seeks, and what I fear it has found.</t5765> <t5766>I am very glad that you have never done anything, never sculpted a statue, painted a picture, or created anything outside of yourself! Life is your art.</t5766> <t5767>You have set your own music.</t5767> <t5768>Your days are your sonnet.”</t5768>
<t5769>1 White lilac.</t5769>
<t5770>Dorian stood up from the piano and ran his hand through his hair.</t5770> <t5771>“Yes, life is wonderful,” he whispered, “but I will not live that kind of life anymore, Harry. And you shouldn't speak too highly of me.</t5771> <t5772>You don't know everything about me.</t5772> <t5773>I think that if you knew, you might even turn your back on me.</t5773> <t5774>You laugh? Don't laugh.”</t5774>
<t5775>“Why did you stop playing, Dorian?</t5775> <t5776>Turn back and play that nocturne for me again.</t5776> <t5777>Look at the great honey-colored moon hanging in the dim sky.</t5777> <t5778>She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play, she will come closer to the earth.</t5778> <t5779>Are you stopping? Then let's go to the club.</t5779> <t5780>This evening is so beautiful, and we must end it beautifully.</t5780> <t5781>Someone at White's is very eager to meet you — young Lord Poole, the eldest son of Bournemouth. He has been imitating your tie and keeps asking me to introduce you to him.</t5781> <t5782>He is quite interesting, and somewhat reminds me of you.”</t5782>
<t5783>“I hope not,” Dorian said, with a sad look in his eyes.</t5783> <t5784>“But tonight I'm a bit tired, Harry.</t5784> <t5785>I can't go to the club. It's almost eleven o'clock, and I want to go to bed early.”</t5785>
<t5786>"Then stay. You have never played as well as you did tonight.</t5786> <t5787>There is something wonderful in your playing.</t5787> <t5788>It is much more expressive than anything I have ever heard from it before."</t5788>
<t5789>“That is because I am about to live kindly,” he replied, smiling, “I have changed a bit.</t5789><t5790>”</t5790>
<t5791>"You cannot change with me, Dorian," Lord Henry said.</t5791> <t5792>"You and I will always be friends.</t5792><t5793>"</t5793>
<t5794>“However, you poisoned me with a book, before.</t5794> <t5795>I cannot forgive that.</t5795> <t5796>Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to anyone else again.</t5796> <t5797>It is harmful.”</t5797>
<t5798>“My dear boy, you really are beginning to moralize.</t5798> <t5799>You will soon be going about like a converted person, and a missionary, warning everyone against all the sins you have grown tired of.</t5799> <t5800>You are far too delightful to do that.</t5800> <t5801>Besides, it is quite useless.</t5801> <t5802>Whatever we are, we are.</t5802> <t5803>As for being poisoned by a book, there is no such thing.</t5803> <t5804>Art has no influence upon action.</t5804> <t5805>It annihilates the desire to act.</t5805> <t5806>It is superbly sterile.</t5806> <t5807>The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.</t5807> <t5808>That is all.</t5808> <t5809>But we are not discussing literature.</t5809> <t5810>Come round tomorrow.</t5810> <t5811>I am going to ride at eleven.</t5811> <t5812>We might ride together, and then I will take you to lunch with Mrs. Branksome.</t5812> <t5813>She is a charming woman, and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying.</t5813> <t5814>Remember to come.</t5814> <t5815>Or shall we lunch with my little duchess?</t5815> <t5816>She says she never sees you now.</t5816> <t5817>Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?</t5817> <t5818>I think you are sure to be.</t5818> <t5819>Her clever tongue gets on one’s nerves.</t5819> <t5820>Well, anyhow, be here at eleven.”</t5820>
<t5821>"Do I really have to go, Harry?"</t5821>
<t5822>“Of course.</t5822> <t5823>The park is very beautiful now.</t5823> <t5824>I don't think there were ever lilacs like that there since the year I met you.”</t5824>
<t5825>“Alright. I will be here at eleven o'clock,” Dorian said.</t5825> <t5826>“Good night, Harry.” As he walked to the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if he had something more to say.</t5826> <t5827>Then he sighed and went out.</t5827>
<t5828>Chapter 20</t5828>
<t5829>It was a beautiful night, so warm that he draped his coat over his arm and didn't even wrap his silk scarf around his neck.</t5829> <t5830>As he was leisurely walking home, smoking a cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed by him.</t5830> <t5831>He heard one of them whisper to the other, "That's Dorian Gray."</t5831> <t5832>He remembered how he used to feel pleased whenever he was pointed out, looked at, or talked about.</t5832> <t5833>Now he no longer cared to hear his own name.</t5833> <t5834>Half the charm of the small village he had been frequenting lately was that no one knew who he was.</t5834> <t5835>He often told the girl he had seduced that he was poor, and she believed him.</t5835> <t5836>Once he even told her that he was very wicked, and she laughed at him, replying that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.</t5836> <t5837>What a strange laugh she had! — just like a thrush singing.</t5837> <t5838>And how beautiful she looked in her cotton dresses and wide-brimmed hats!</t5838> <t5839>She knew nothing at all, but she had everything he had lost.</t5839>
<t5840>When he got home, he found the servant awake and waiting for him.</t5840> <t5841>He sent him to bed, threw himself onto the sofa in the library, and began to ponder some things that Lord Henry had said to him.</t5841>
<t5842>Is it really true that people cannot change?</t5842> <t5843>Do you feel a maddening craving for the purity untouched by the dust of the world from your youth — your rosy-white youth, as Lord Henry once called it.</t5843> <t5844>You know that you have defiled yourself, have filled your soul with depravity and brought terrible visions into your imagination; that you have been a harmful influence on others, have tasted the dreadful pleasure of living like that; and that, in the lives that have encountered yours, it was the purest, most promising one that you have tainted.</t5844> <t5845>But can it all be restored?</t5845> <t5846>Is there any hope for you?</t5846>
<t5847>Oh! In a strange moment of pride and passion, he had prayed that the portrait would bear the burden of his days, while he would retain the radiant, unblemished beauty of eternal youth!</t5847> <t5848>All his failures stemmed from that.</t5848> <t5849>It would have been better for him if every sin in his life had brought with it a sure and swift punishment.</t5849> <t5850>There is purification in punishment.</t5850> <t5851>Not "Forgive us our sins," but "Punish us for our wrongdoings" should be the prayer of man to the all-just God.</t5851>
<t5852>The intricately carved mirror that Lord Henry had given him, many years ago, stood on the table, and the ivory-limbed Cupids still laughed around it as before.</t5852> <t5853>He picked it up, as he had done on that dreadful night, when he first noticed the change in that disastrous picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes, gazed into its polished shield.</t5853> <t5854>Once, someone who had loved him very much had written him a mad letter, ending with these adoring words: “The world changes because you are made of ivory and gold.</t5854> <t5855>The curves of your lips rewrite history.”</t5855> <t5856>These sentences came back to his memory, and he repeated them to himself.</t5856> <t5857>Then he grew to hate his own beauty, and, flinging the mirror to the floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel.</t5857> <t5858>It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth he had prayed for.</t5858> <t5859>Without these two things, his life might not have been soiled.</t5859> <t5860>To him, beauty was only a mask, youth was only a mockery.</t5860> <t5861>What was youth at its best?</t5861> <t5862>A green, unripe time, a time of shallow moods and sickly thoughts.</t5862> <t5863>Why had he worn its livery? Youth had spoiled him.</t5863>
<t5864>It's better not to think about the past.</t5864> <t5865>Nothing can change it.</t5865> <t5866>Yourself, your future, are what you should think about.</t5866> <t5867>James Vane was buried in an unmarked grave in Selby cemetery.</t5867> <t5868>Alan Campbell shot himself one night in his laboratory, but he did not reveal the secret he was forced to know.</t5868> <t5869>The pointless commotion around Basil Hallward's disappearance will soon pass.</t5869> <t5870>It is also fading away.</t5870> <t5871>You are absolutely safe.</t5871> <t5872>In fact, it wasn't really Basil Hallward's death that weighed most heavily on your mind.</t5872> <t5873>It was the half-dead state of your soul that tormented you.</t5873> <t5874>Basil had painted the portrait that ruined your life.</t5874> <t5875>You could not forgive him for that.</t5875> <t5876>It was that portrait that did everything.</t5876> <t5877>Basil had said things to you that were unbearable, and you still had to patiently endure them.</t5877> <t5878>The murder was simply the result of a momentary fit of rage.</t5878> <t5879>As for Alan Campbell, his suicide was his own act.</t5879> <t5880>He decided to do it.</t5880> <t5881>It had nothing to do with you.</t5881>
<t5882>A new life!</t5882> <t5883>That's what you need.</t5883> <t5884>That's what you have been waiting for.</t5884> <t5885>Surely, you have already started it.</t5885> <t5886>After all, you have spared an innocent creature. You will never tempt the innocent again.</t5886> <t5887>You will be kind.</t5887>
<t5888>When he thought about Hetty</t5888> <t5889>Merton, he began to wonder whether the portrait in the locked room had changed.</t5889> <t5890>Surely it couldn't be as horrifying as it once was?</t5890> <t5891>Perhaps if his life became purer, he could rid that face of all traces of sinful passion.</t5891> <t5892>Maybe the traces of sin had already disappeared.</t5892> <t5893>He would go and see.</t5893>
<t5894>He took the lamp off the table and crept upstairs.</t5894> <t5895>As he unlatched the door, a joyful smile flashed across his strangely youthful face and lingered for a moment around his lips.</t5895> <t5896>Yes, he would live decently, the hideous thing he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him.</t5896> <t5897>He felt as if a burden had been lifted from him.</t5897>
<t5898>He quietly stepped in, locked the door behind him, as was his habit, and pulled the purple curtain away from the portrait.</t5898> <t5899>A cry of pain and anger escaped his lips.</t5899> <t5900>He could not see any change, except that in those eyes there was a cunning look, and on that mouth there was a hypocritical curve.</t5900> <t5901>It was still disgusting—more disgusting, if possible, than before—and the red dew staining the hand seemed fresher, more like newly shed blood.</t5901> <t5902>At that moment, he shivered.</t5902> <t5903>Was it only pride that had made him do his one good deed?</t5903> <t5904>Or was it the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with a mocking smile? Or the passion for acting a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are? Or, perhaps, all these things?</t5904> <t5905>And why was the stain larger than before?</t5905> <t5906>It seemed to have crept like a dreadful disease over the wrinkled fingers.</t5906> <t5907>There was blood on the painted feet, as though it had dripped down—blood even on the hand that had not held the knife.</t5907> <t5908>Confess?</t5908> <t5909>Did it mean that he should confess?</t5909> <t5910>Give himself up, and be put to death?</t5910> <t5911>He laughed.</t5911> <t5912>He felt that the idea was monstrous.</t5912> <t5913>Besides, even if he did confess, who would believe him?</t5913> <t5914>There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.</t5914> <t5915>Everything belonging to him had been destroyed.</t5915> <t5916>He had burned what had been below stairs himself.</t5916> <t5917>People would simply say he was mad. They would shut him up if he persisted in his story...</t5917> <t5918>Yet it was his duty to confess, to suffer public shame, to make public atonement.</t5918> <t5919>There was God, and He required confession before men as well as before Heaven.</t5919> <t5920>He could do nothing that would cleanse him till he had told his own sin.</t5920> <t5921>His sin? He shrugged his shoulders.</t5921> <t5922>The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was thinking of Hetty</t5922> <t5923>Merton.</t5923> <t5924>For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul that he was looking at.</t5924> <t5925>Pride? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his renunciation than that?</t5925> <t5926>There had been something more.</t5926> <t5927>At least he thought so.</t5927> <t5928>But who could say?...</t5928> <t5929>No.</t5929> <t5930>There had been nothing more.</t5930> <t5931>It was pride that had made him spare her.</t5931> <t5932>It was hypocrisy that had made him wear the mask of goodness.</t5932> <t5933>It was curiosity that had made him seek to deny himself.</t5933> <t5934>He recognized that now.</t5934>
<t5935>But this murder — will it follow you all your life?</t5935> <t5936>Will you always have to bear the burden of the past? Will you really have to confess?</t5936> <t5937>No. There is only one piece of evidence left against you.</t5937> <t5938>The painting itself — that is the evidence.</t5938> <t5939>You will destroy it.</t5939> <t5940>Why have you kept it for so long?</t5940> <t5941>It once gave you joy to watch it change and age.</t5941> <t5942>Recently, you no longer find such joy.</t5942> <t5943>It keeps waking you up in the middle of the night.</t5943> <t5944>When you are away, you fear that other eyes might gaze upon it.</t5944> <t5945>It casts a shadow of sorrow over your passions.</t5945> <t5946>Just thinking about it has ruined many moments of joy.</t5946> <t5947>To you, it is like a conscience.</t5947> <t5948>Yes, it is a conscience.</t5948> <t5949>You must destroy it.</t5949>
<t5950>He looked around and saw the knife that had once stabbed Basil Hallward.</t5950> <t5951>He had cleaned it many times, until there was no stain left.</t5951> <t5952>It gleamed brightly.</t5952> <t5953>Since it had killed the artist, it would also kill the artist's creation, and everything associated with it.</t5953> <t5954>It would kill the past, and when that past was dead, he would be free.</t5954> <t5955>It would kill this monstrous soul, and, without its ghastly warnings, he would be at peace.</t5955> <t5956>He grabbed the object and stabbed it into the painting.</t5956>
<t5957>Hearing a scream and a loud crash.</t5957> <t5958>The scream in the terrible throes of death was so horrifying that it woke the servants, who crept out of their rooms.</t5958> <t5959>Two gentlemen, passing through the square below, stopped and looked up at the enormous house.</t5959> <t5960>They continued until they met a policeman and brought him back.</t5960> <t5961>He rang the bell several times, but there was no response.</t5961> <t5962>Except for a light in one of the top-floor windows, the house was completely dark.</t5962> <t5963>After a while, he stepped back and stood in the adjacent gate to observe.</t5963>
<t5964>"Whose house is that, officer?" the older of the two gentlemen asked.</t5964>
<t5965>"Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir," the policeman replied.</t5965>
<t5966>They looked at each other as they walked and laughed scornfully.</t5966> <t5967>One of the two was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.</t5967>
<t5968>Inside, in the servants' quarters of the house, the half-dressed servants were whispering to each other.</t5968> <t5969>Old Mrs. Leaf was crying and clenching her hands tightly.</t5969> <t5970>Francis was as pale as death.</t5970>
<t5971>After about a quarter of an hour, he called the coachman and a servant, then stealthily went upstairs.</t5971> <t5972>They knocked on the door, but there was no response.</t5972> <t5973>They called out loudly.</t5973> <t5974>Everything was as silent as the grave.</t5974> <t5975>Finally, after failing to break the door open, they climbed onto the roof and then descended to the balcony.</t5975> <t5976>The windows easily gave way; their latches were old.</t5976>
<t5977>When they got in, they saw a magnificent portrait of the master hanging on the wall, just as they had seen him last, with all the wonderful springtime beauty.</t5977> <t5978>Lying on the floor was a dead man, dressed in evening clothes, with a knife in his heart.</t5978> <t5979>His face was haggard, wrinkled, and repulsive.</t5979> <t5980>It was not until they examined the rings closely that they recognized who he was.</t5980>
